<i>We're goin' to the water park,

<i>We're going to the water park,

This is gonna be so awesome{\*, dude}.
I haven't been {\*to the water park }there in {\*like, }over a year!

6
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:52,469
What do you guys wanna do first?
I hear they have a new inner-tube slide.

7
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,846
No, {\*dude. }we gotta do the wave pool first.
It's so dope.

8
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:57,640
- As long as there {\*aren't any }ain't minorities.
- What are you talking about{\*, Eric}?

9
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:00,644
{\*You know, }There's always{\* like} five or six minorities
wearing their T-shirts in {\*the wave pool}there.

10
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:02,812
- Pisses me off.
- We're here! {\*It's }The water park.

{\*I'm gonna}I'll pick you boys up

00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:11,779
- Come on, let's go!
- We got it, Dad.

13
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,783
Six adorable children, please.

14
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,369
Wave pool!{\* Wave pool!}
Wave pool!

15
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:21,790
What the hell?

16
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,007
{\*All right.}
What do you guys wanna ride first?

17
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:33,301
{\*Well, }Cartman said he wanted
to do the wave pool{\* first}, right{\* Cartman}?

18
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,554
Forget it.
Just forget it!

19
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:43,645
{\*Dude, this is }Awesome!

20
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,147
You {\*guys }wanna see how long
I can hold my breath under water?

21
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,983
{\*Hey, fellas! }Fellas, hang on!
I gotta go to the bathroom!

22
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:50,944
- Okay, go ahead.
- {\*Okay, }Thanks!

23
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:53,029
I can {\*seriously }hold my breath
longer than anybody.

24
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:54,531
Somebody time me{\, alright}.

25
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,157
{\*All right. }Check it out...

26
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,037
What the fuck?
Are you peeing in the pool?

27
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:02,455
You said go ahead!

28
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:06,083
- {\*Come on, Kyle. }Let's check out the fireboats.
- {\*No, dude.}Butters' pee is in there!

29
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,920
{\*Come on. }Look at all this water.
It doesn't matter if one person pees{\* in it}.

30
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:11,548
Yeah, come on{\*, Kyle}.
I'm not the only person who's peed{\* in the pool}.

31
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:12,840
Lots a people do.

32
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:15,218
- {\*No, }They don't.
- Yeah, they do{\*, Kyle}.

33
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:18,220
To be perfectly frank,
I peed in the pool {\*about }25 seconds ago.

34
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:19,430
Dude!

35
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,808
{\*Come on, }Show us how long
you can hold your breath!

36
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:28,815
<i>What has happened to this place</i>

37
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,442
<i>I don't recognize it anymore</i>

38
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:35,280
<i>It used to be so fun and special</i>

39
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,615
<i>What is life worth living for?</i>

40
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:41,327
<i>The dream is dead, our land is gone</i>

41
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:42,829
<i>There's a hole in my heart</i>

42
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:46,457
<i>And I can't go on</i>

43
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,377
<i>There are too many minorities</i>

44
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:52,547
<i>At my water park</i>

45
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,467
<i>This was our land, our dream</i>

46
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:59,304
<i>And they've taken it all away</i>

47
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,890
<i>They just keep coming and coming</i>

48
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:05,894
<i>I tried to go and tell the police</i>

49
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,730
<i>But even the authorities</i>

50
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:12,108
<i>Are minorities</i>

51
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,236
<i>At my water park</i>

52
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,951
<i>There's no place for me
to sit anymore</i>

53
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:24,829
<i>And the lines just keep
getting crazier</i>

54
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,915
<i>There are Mexicans all around me</i>

55
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,418
<i>The Lazy River has never been lazier</i>

56
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:34,421
<i>It's a 40-minute wait to go
down one slide</i>

57
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:38,551
<i>And the instructions are in Spanish
on the Zip Line ride</i>

58
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,555
{\*Just }Do it in English!

59
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:45,433
<i>There are too many minorities</i>

60
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,018
<i>Too many</i>

61
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:50,188
<i>At my water park
Somebody do something</i>

62
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,066
<i>Where did they all come from?</i>

63
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,443
<i>Why can't they leave
this land alone?</i>

64
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:59,322
<i>And it's such a tragedy
Feel a bit like dying</i>

65
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,741
<i>We've been lookin'
the other way too long</i>

66
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:04,869
<i>We've got to change our priorities</i>

67
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,289
<i>And get all these minorities</i>

68
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:11,084
<i>Out of my water park</i>

69
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:15,213
<i>Minorities
Mexicans and Asians</i>

70
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,673
<i>Black people</i>

71
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,968
<i>I think I even saw
A Native American</i>

72
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,094
Gross.

73
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,263
<i>God, I'm asking please</i>

74
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,518
<i>Get all of these minorities</i>

75
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:32,938
<i>Out of my water park</i>

76
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,315
<i>My water park</i>

77
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,154
- {\*After this,}You {\*guys }wanna hit the hurricane slides?
- You bet!

78
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,573
- I'm not getting back in the water.
- Come on{\*, Kyle}.

79
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:44,659
{\*Dude, }I {\*just }found out
that everybody pees in pools.

80
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,495
- Why would I go back?
- Not everybody pees in pools.

81
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,997
Do you pee in the pool?

82
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,916
- Not today... yet.
- Come on!

83
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:54,377
{\*Well dude, }What are you gonna do?
{\*Just }Hang out here {\*at the table }all day?

84
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:55,836
- Most likely.
- {\*You }Guys!

85
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,380
{\*You guys, }We have got problems
of Biblical proportions!

86
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,633
- {\*Dude, }Where have you been?
- I've been counting.

87
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:03,678
Do you know
there are 205 Mexicans here?

88
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,764
And there are 109 black people.

89
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,058
- So what?
- So...

90
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:11,561
Guess how many white people
are bat the water park today?

91
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,312
143.

92
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:16,273
There are actually
more minorities here than us.

93
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:19,068
{\*Well, }Then, they're not minorities,
are they?

94
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,114
- What do you mean?
- Dumb ass, if there's 60% of them

95
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,574
to 40% of us,
then who's the minority?

96
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:29,328
- The black and brown people.
- No, you're the minority!

97
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,581
Do I look like a minority to you,
stupid?

98
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,458
{\*Now }Look, {\*guys, }I did some calculations.

99
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:37,045
Just last year, there were almost
90% normal people to minorities.

100
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,464
That's a 50% rise in one year.

101
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:42,926
- It's more math than you've ever done.{\*This is more math than I've ever seen you do.}
- Because it's important!

102
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,428
A 50% rise each year
means that in three years,

103
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,346
the world will be only minorities.

104
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,140
That's 2012.
The Mayans predicted this!

105
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,726
- {\*The }Who?
- The Mayans.

106
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,062
They knew {\*that }minorities
would take over{\* the world} by {\*the year }2012.

107
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,606
- And now it's happening!
- I'm going to go on the slides.

108
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,609
You guys?
We have to do something to stop this!

109
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:00,735
Come on!

110
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,281
Well, looks like at least
you've got some sense left in you{\*, Kyle}.

111
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,867
What will we do to keep
that prediction from coming true?{\*So what are we going to do to keep the Mayans prediction from coming true, buddy?}

112
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:09,410
Blow it out your ass{\*, Cartman}.

113
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:13,330
Eugene!
That is disgusting!

114
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:17,835
- Did you just pee in the pool?
- Come on! Look how big this pool is.

115
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,463
One person peeing in it
isn't going to hurt anything.

116
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:29,138
Oh, my God!

117
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,017
Gentlemen, I am the Pipi.

118
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:34,852
How can I help you?

119
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,855
Pipi, we have some dire news
concerning your water park.

120
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,524
I've just finished some tests.

121
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,652
The water in your park
is now 98% pee.

122
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:44,945
Yes?
So what's the problem?

123
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,824
Pipi, you know
that acceptable pee levels

124
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,326
in any water park is 83%.

125
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,954
- You have to shut down.
- What?

126
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,832
I can't close down.
Now it's my biggest weekend!

127
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,708
Everyone is having the fun!

128
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,877
You're endangering people's lives!

129
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,546
If those {\*pee }levels hit 100%,
there's no telling what will happen.

130
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,883
And what proof do you have
that the pee levels will go up?

131
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,261
One in three people admit
they pee in pools.

132
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:11,055
Another doesn't admit it{\*Add another for people who do but don't admit it},
that's two in three.

133
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,932
{\*You've got just }There's over 500 people out there.

134
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:15,768
That's 332 people
about to pee in your water!

135
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,271
Gentlemen, please.
I come from the Venice.

136
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:22,066
Venice is almost all pee,

137
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,943
and we do just fine.

138
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:27,321
We swim in the pee,
we sing in the pee.

139
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:30,199
You can't barge in here
and tell me that I have to close down

140
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:33,077
just because my water park
has too much pee.

141
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:35,329
You have to evacuate people now!

142
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:39,000
He said he's not doing it!
And as his lawyer, I advise you{\* gentlemen},

143
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,502
to leave and take
your wild pee theories with you.

144
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:46,257
If one more person urinates{\* in your pool},
it could set off a chain reaction.

145
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,426
Then the pee will be on your hands.

146
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:56,267
{\*Oh boy, }The waves are startin' up again!

147
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:57,852
This is sweet, huh, Kenny?

148
00:08:15,494 --> 00:08:16,495
What's that?

149
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,111
It's pee!

150
00:08:49,236 --> 00:08:50,696
Look out for the pee!

151
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:58,495
Gross!

152
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,507
It's the pee!

153
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,013
Oh, my God!
They killed Kenny!

154
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:18,641
Sick!

155
00:09:26,273 --> 00:09:27,984
{\pub}I want that entire water park

156
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,819
contained and quarantined
until I get some answers.

157
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,034
- What's going on?
- I told you {\*people}to keep civilians back!

158
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,494
{\*Sir, please, }My son is in there.

159
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,621
- What's happened?
- We don't know yet.{\*, all right?}

160
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,832
There {\*'s been }was a pee breach
and {\*a lot of }many people are dead.

161
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:46,168
- Sorry, you'll have to...{\*Now, I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to...}
- These men know the situation.{\*Captain, these two men claim to know the situation.}

162
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,380
We warned the owner of the park,
but he refused to shut down.

163
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,341
- This was inevitable.
- So this is all pee-related?

164
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,302
I tested the pH levels this morning.

165
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,723
- And?
- It was almost all p, no H.

166
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,850
Oh, my God.
I've got to help him!

167
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,144
Stay back!

168
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,813
You can't just leave my son
in there with all that pee!

169
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:09,233
{\*Sir, }It's possible with a crane,
we could help any survivors out.

170
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:12,694
- {\*I think }That would be a very bad idea.
- And why is that?

171
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,114
Anyone inside there is contaminated.

172
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,783
We {\*have reason to }believe {\*that }when people
are exposed to that much pee,

173
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,452
they change.

174
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,996
- Change how?
- All right, bring in the monkey.

175
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,502
We've only tested the theory
on monkeys so far.

176
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,005
This monkey is healthy
and normal in every way.

177
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,339
But now watch.

178
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:41,640
My God, he's become full of rage!

179
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,065
Kyle, quick!
You gotta swim over to us.

180
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:51,608
No way!

181
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:54,069
- You gotta swim over here{\*, Kyle}.
- Come on{\*, Kyle}!

182
00:10:54,653 --> 00:10:56,113
Dude, that's all pee!

183
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:59,533
- {\*Well, }If you don't swim in it, {\*you're gonna }you'll die.
- I'll die if I do swim in it.

184
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:01,994
{\*Kyle, }It's just pee.
It's not that big a deal.

185
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,621
Yes, it is a big deal!

186
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:07,249
Why do you think we wash our hands
after going to the bathroom?{\*Why do you think everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom?}

187
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,546
Well, not everyone washes their hands
after they go to the bathroom.

188
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,508
- What?
- Come on, {\*dude, }you gotta swim.

189
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,760
You don't wash your hands
after going to the bathroom?

190
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,512
Not... all the time.

191
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,055
That is gross!

192
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,141
{\*Why? }It's not like
you're peeing on your hands.

193
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,394
There's more germs on most furniture
than {\*there is }in pee.

194
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,187
{\*If anything, }You should wash your hands
before you touch your wiener.

195
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:31,898
Kyle, come on!

196
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,735
God dammit!

197
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:58,134
Do you need to wash your hands?

198
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,011
I can't hold on...

199
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,346
Help! Help!

200
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,307
Here!
Kid, grab this stick!

201
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,560
Yes, help me! I'm just a little boy.
You have to help me.

202
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,444
Are you okay?

203
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:20,906
Thank you.

204
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,034
{\*Well, }What are we gonna do now?

205
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,577
- We've got to just wait it out.
- Yeah, but for how long?

206
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,913
We need to find something
to paddle with.

207
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,832
<i>Day one.
It has happened.</i>

208
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:33,627
<i>The Mayans were right.
Only thing they got wrong was the date.</i>

209
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:37,381
<i>It is 2009 and I appear to be
the last of my species alive.</i>

210
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,592
<i>Now it's just me, all alone,
with minorities.</i>

211
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,471
<i>What will the minorities do with me?
I'm sure that's what's on {\*all }their minds.</i>

212
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:49,560
<i>I have to make myself seem useful{\* to them},
or they will surely not let me live.</i>

213
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,813
Does anyone need medical help?
I am a doctor.

214
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:58,652
Randy, calm down!
I can't understand what you're saying.

215
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:02,239
<i>It's the pee!
It's all pee, {\*and }nobody can go in or out!</i>

216
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:03,824
What is all pee?

217
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:06,535
Sharon, the water park
had a pee meltdown!

218
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,412
They think a lot of people
have died.

219
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:11,499
- <i>{\*What? }What about Stan? Is he okay?</i>
- I don't know!

220
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,542
The whole water park
has been quarantined.

221
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,711
They're worried anyone
left alive could be...

222
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,797
some kind of raging
hate-filled mutants!

223
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,883
<i>Randy, you've got to do something!</i>

224
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:23,219
Calm down, Sharon.
Calm down!

225
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,179
They're trying to find an antidote.

226
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:28,432
Once they believe they can neutralize
the enraging effects of the pee...

227
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,225
they'll go in to look for survivors.

228
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,353
I said keep the media out.

229
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,773
If the public hears about this,
we'll have a full-scale panic{\* on our hands}.

230
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,984
- Dammit! Where is that antidote?
- Here! Here!

231
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,319
We think we have it{\*, sir}.

232
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,612
It's the best we could {\*come up with}do
in such a short time.

233
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,825
We {\*aren't sure of }don't know the ramifications,
but it does appear to neutralize

234
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,493
some particles of the urine.

235
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,619
{\*All right, }Let's test it.
Bring in the monkeys!

236
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,834
Let's hope to Christ this works.

237
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:06,971
Dammit, no!

238
00:14:07,554 --> 00:14:09,973
- They're still angry!
- This one's really angry.

239
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,558
It's out of control!

240
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,275
Find an antidote that works!

241
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:23,612
- {\*Dude, }Why aren't people coming to help us?
- I don't know.

242
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,447
Why...

243
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,409
Why didn't Pipi listen?

244
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,954
They tried to warn the Pipi,
but Pipi not believe them.

245
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,289
Who are you?

246
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:36,750
I'm so sorry!
This is all my fault!

247
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,794
I should have shut
my water park down

248
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,171
when it reached 90% pee!

249
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:44,466
{\*Yeah. Well, }People should know
that peeing in pools is bad!

250
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:47,553
But wait!
Maybe you boys a can help Pipi.

251
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:51,223
In the maintenance room,
there is the emergency release valve.

252
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:53,975
If you open it, all this a pee
can be lowered!

253
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:57,646
- Okay! Where's the maintenance room?
- That is the problem.

254
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:00,941
The maintenance room
is way down on the basement level.

255
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:04,027
I would do it,
but Pipi is a no good at the swimming.

256
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:06,697
Somebody will have
to dive down into the pee,

257
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,991
then stay there
to turn the release wheel.

258
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,744
So who can hold
their breath the longest?

259
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,750
You said you can hold
your breath the longest{\*, Kyle}.

260
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:18,917
Not in pee!

261
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,544
Please, you have to hurry.

262
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:24,006
I'll draw you the map
and instructions {\*how }to shut off the valve.

263
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,634
It'll be as easy
as peeing in the shower!

264
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,260
Who pees in the shower?

265
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,847
{\*Well, }It's not like if you {\*suddenly }have to pee,
you're gonna get out of the shower.

266
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:36,060
Yeah, seeing all that running water
always makes me need to pee.

267
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,728
You don't pee in the shower{\*, dude}!
That's fucking disgusting!

268
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,064
Boys, please!

269
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:43,650
We've got to get {\*this boy }him to that {\*drainage }valve
or we're all gonna die.

270
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:44,985
Jesus Christ!

271
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:52,326
{\pub}<i>It has been many, many hours
since the apocalypse,</i>

272
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,161
<i>and all I keep thinking is "Why me?"</i>

273
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:58,373
<i>Why am I the only one of my race
God chose {\*to survive }in this minority-run world?</i>

274
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:01,460
<i>When the smoke has cleared,
{\*I'm sure }the minorities will start rebuilding.</i>

275
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:04,088
<i>Building the world in their way.</i>

276
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:05,881
<i>I can see it now.</i>

277
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:13,680
All right, Eric Cartman.
Let's hear your book report.

278
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,516
I read <i>Treasure Island</i>,

279
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,851
because I was so happy
when I saw that movie.

280
00:16:18,685 --> 00:16:21,272
You're living
in a minority-speaking country now.

281
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,606
Say it right.

282
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:25,692
Because I was so happy
when I seen that movie.

283
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,527
Good.

284
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,531
<i>Trying to find a job
will be even harder.</i>

285
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,451
You don't expect
to make the same amount of money

286
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,202
that minorities make, do you?

287
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,787
I do just as much work.

288
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,249
You're trash around here.

289
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,584
You'll never make
as much as a minority.

290
00:16:45,003 --> 00:16:47,756
<i>Eventually, the minorities
will do away with me all together.</i>

291
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:51,176
All those in favor
of putting white people in camps?

292
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,762
All those opposed?

293
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:57,432
The minorities win!

294
00:16:59,726 --> 00:17:03,647
I don't want to live in your world!{\*, do you understand?}
Your world is {\*cold and }void of any humanity.

295
00:17:04,731 --> 00:17:06,650
Just kill me.
Kill me now!

296
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:08,526
Do it!

297
00:17:09,736 --> 00:17:12,697
Okay, there...
We are almost ready for the diving.

298
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:16,452
Now if you run into the any problems,
you just tug three times on the cable

299
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,704
and Pipi will pull you back
to the surface.

300
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,164
Let's {\just }get this over with.

301
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,708
You got the map
and Pipi's instructions.

302
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,837
Good. Now, just one last thing.
You need to drink some pee.

303
00:17:27,462 --> 00:17:30,507
- What?
- You {\*just }need to drink {\*about }three cups pee.

304
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:31,467
Why?

305
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:35,137
You swim down deep in the pee,
you get the pressure, the benz-a!

306
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:38,556
You have to fill the inside of your body
with some pee to compensate.

307
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,768
That's true{\*, dude}.
Didn't you see the Abyss?

308
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:44,229
I am not drinking pee!

309
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:47,566
But only you can hold breath
to swim down and release the valve.{\*But only you can hold breath a long time to swim down and release the valve.}

310
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:50,277
If you get the benz-a,
you a fail and we all die!

311
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,904
- Just drink the pee{\*, Kyle}.
- Please,{\* Kyle.} I wanna go home.

312
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,281
What's the problem?

313
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,658
When you pee,
either in the toilet or in the shower,

314
00:17:56,783 --> 00:17:59,495
it all goes to the sewer.
The sewer all goes to the ocean.

315
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,581
The ocean is the water we all drink.
You are always drinking the pee!

316
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:05,709
That doesn't make me feel better!
I wouldn't even be able to keep it down.

317
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:08,504
Sure you will!
You drank only pee for nine months

318
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,756
when you lived
in your mother's belly.

319
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:15,218
Make way!
I need to speak to the fire marshal!

320
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:18,764
Sir, I just got off the phone
with my colleagues at the university.

321
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,974
They've also been
testing antidotes on monkeys.

322
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:23,102
They're claiming
that they've had success,

323
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,562
using simple musa acuminata.

324
00:18:26,521 --> 00:18:28,106
Wait.
You mean a banana.

325
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,400
Is it possible?

326
00:18:30,525 --> 00:18:33,028
The antidote is something
as simple as a banana?

327
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:34,946
Get another monkey!

328
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:36,781
{\*All right, }Conners.

329
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,963
Holy God!
It works.

330
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,424
All right, let's start moving in{\*, everyone}!
Check for...

331
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:56,260
Hold on!
It is a promising lead,

332
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:59,054
but this antidote
hasn't yet been tested on a human.

333
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,098
I'll do it.

334
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,435
You can test the antidote on me.

335
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,946
You sure you want to do this?

336
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:18,907
Give me the banana.

337
00:19:43,181 --> 00:19:44,307
He looks agitated.

338
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,896
He's losin' it!
Stevens, your gun!

339
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,314
No, wait!

340
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,111
I'm okay.

341
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:59,489
- He's all right!
- The banana worked!

342
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:05,287
- Come on, dude.
- I'm thinking about it!

343
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:07,288
It's {\probably }better
if you don't think about it.

344
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:10,458
There's no more time!
You have to drink the pee now!

345
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:20,427
Come on,
you have to drink all the pee!

346
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,054
You can do it, Kyle!

347
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:33,065
All right!
{\Now }You can open the release valve.

348
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,358
Okay, so let's...

349
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:36,985
Look!

350
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:45,201
- All right, they finally came for us!
- Are you fucking kidding me?

351
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,794
Wait here a minute, Stan.
I'm going to call your mother.

352
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,587
Guys?

353
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:58,173
Guys!
It's true!

354
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:01,050
- You all did survive!
- You lived?

355
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:04,846
Oh, my God{\*, you guys}!
I {\*really }thought I was the only non-minority{\* on Earth}!

356
00:21:04,971 --> 00:21:06,348
How many of {\* our species}us survived?

357
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:08,642
That wasn't a Mayan apocalypse,
you racist idiot!

358
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,852
It wasn't?
So then you mean...

359
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,938
we do have until 2012.

360
00:21:13,271 --> 00:21:14,731
{\*Well, }It may be only three years,

361
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:17,358
but I intend to live
those precious years to the fullest!

362
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,153
Get me to a hospital.{\*Will somebody just get me to a hospital?}
I need to get my stomach pumped.

363
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,406
Come on.
It was just a little pee{\*, Kyle}.

364
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,908
God dammit, don't you get it?
I hate pee!

365
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,743
I'm grossed out by pee!

366
00:21:26,993 --> 00:21:30,163
The only thing I find
more disgusting than pee is bananas!

367
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:32,874
- All right{\ everyone}, quick! Here you go!
- What's this?

368
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,919
You all need
to eat your banana immediately!

369
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,211
What {\*the hell }for?

370
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,797
Eat the banana
or we have to put you down!

371
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:45,429
