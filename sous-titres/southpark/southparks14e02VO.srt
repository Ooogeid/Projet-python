La Fabrique

2
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:36,827
Okay, kids.
Let's take our seats.

3
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:39,331
There has been a change
in school policy,

4
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:42,208
and so I am assigning you all
a book to read.

5
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,794
A book?
God, I hate those!

6
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:47,839
Now, kids,
this book is very controversial

7
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:50,800
and has just been taken
off the banned books list.

8
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:51,884
Really?

9
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,387
It's called <i>Catcher in the Rye.</i>

10
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:57,306
It has some very risqué parts.

11
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,391
All right!

12
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,560
- And strong, vulgar language.
- <i>Awesome!</i>

13
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:05,148
In fact, many schools
across the country still ban this book

14
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:07,734
because it's thought
to be so inappropriate.

15
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,318
Man, I can't wait!

16
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:12,030
Tonight, I want you to read
chapters one through five.

17
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:15,032
- Tomorrow, we'll discuss...
- Come on, let's read it now!

18
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:18,369
Didn't the guy who shot John Lennon
say it was because of this book?

19
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:23,124
Apparently, John Lennon's killer said
he was inspired by <i>Catcher in the Rye.</i>

20
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,709
But he was just a kook.

21
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:27,587
You're telling us
this book is filthy, inappropriate

22
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:29,506
and made a guy
shoot the king of hippies?

23
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,257
Can we please read this right now?

24
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,301
You will read it at home

25
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:37,221
and you will all be mature
about its adult themes and language!

26
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,524
Did you get to any dirty parts yet?

27
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:51,861
It's still some whiny annoying teenager
talking about how lame he is.

28
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,616
I don't get it.
What's so controversial about this?

29
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:58,952
All he's done
is said shit and fuck a few times.

30
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,454
I know.
I'm almost at the end and nothing.

31
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,543
Motherfucker!

32
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,255
The whole thing.
I read the whole fucking thing!

33
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:13,591
I kept thinking, all right,
the offensive stuff must be coming.

34
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,635
And after a hundred pages,
I was like,

35
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,929
all right,
all the dirty stuff is at the end.

36
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:20,515
Then I got to the last page
and I was all,

37
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,933
the fuck is this?

38
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,059
I just read a book!
For nothing!

39
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,395
Why the hell was this book banned?

40
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,106
They fucking tricked us!

41
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:31,317
Tricked us into reading a book
by promising us vulgarity.

42
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:37,073
<i>What the fuck is so dirty
about this piece of shit?</i>

43
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,992
We know, we were just saying that!

44
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,120
Why would anyone think
this book is obscene or dangerous?

45
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,293
Kill John Lennon!

46
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,054
Dad, where does John Lennon live?

47
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,181
John Lennon's dead.

48
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:04,559
Dangit.

49
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,022
Some people
really do consider this obscene!

50
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,608
It's not obscene.
I'll show them fucking obscene.

51
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,652
We should write our own banned book.

52
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,946
We could get a book banned
way more than this one.

53
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,573
- Sweet!
- <i>Awesome!</i>

54
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,241
<i>The Tale of...</i>

55
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,578
<i>The Tale of Scrotie McDick'n'Ass.</i>

56
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,663
<i>No, </i>Scrotie McBoogerballs.

57
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:27,665
That's good!

58
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,418
All right, Chapter One...

59
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,838
It was a warm spring morning...

60
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:06,955
<i>The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs</i>?

61
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,291
"It was a warm summer morning

62
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,711
"when Scrotie McBoogerballs
awoke to find his..."

63
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,423
"He took a..."

64
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:18,549
What?

65
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,137
My God!

66
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:25,098
"He then grabbed his dog's..."

67
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,478
My God!

68
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:34,649
"Walking out of his house,
he spotted a bloody, pus covered..."

69
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,247
You need to read this!

70
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,124
- Read what?
- This book!

71
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,376
Our son and his friends wrote it!

72
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:54,502
So?

73
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,549
It's really good.

74
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:01,676
I mean, it's disgusting.

75
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,554
It's the most disgusting thing
I've ever read,

76
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,890
but the plot is amazing!

77
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:10,143
And the characters are so vivid.

78
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,061
"It was a warm summer morning

79
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,731
"when Scrotie McBoogerballs
awoke to find his..."

80
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,610
- Gross!
- Just keep reading!

81
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,653
"He took a..."
"And..."

82
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,614
This is...

83
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:30,455
I know, but trust me,
you gotta push through to the end.

84
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,458
- That's just wrong!
- Please!

85
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,543
You've got to listen to me!

86
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:39,005
"Walking out of the house,
he found a bloody, pus filled..."

87
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,131
What?

88
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,592
"Which he immediately
stuck up his infected..."

89
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:56,940
"That was all long ago
in some brief lost spring,

90
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,108
"in a place that is no more.

91
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:02,111
"In that hour that vag frogs begin

92
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:06,199
"and the scent off Scrotie's
infected anus comes strongest."

93
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,412
- Man.
- Well?

94
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,082
It's awesome.

95
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,501
It's the best book I've ever read.

96
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,461
Right?
It's not just me!

97
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,380
The whole part about Amsterdam...

98
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:23,132
What do we do?

99
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:26,010
We can't support
our son talking like this, but...

100
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,345
I know...

101
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,098
People need to read this book...

102
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:32,058
This is Pulitzer Prize stuff.

103
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,269
You're dead, Kenny!

104
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,482
Guys!
We are totally fucked!

105
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:42,693
The book is gone from my drawer.
My parents must have found it!

106
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,489
Why we're all fucked?
They'll think you wrote it all.

107
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,575
I'm not taking the heat for this alone!
We all wrote it.

108
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,828
If I'm going down,
somebody must go down with me!

109
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,788
If I'm going down,
Cartman's going down!

110
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,457
And if I'm going down,
Kyle and Kenny are going down.

111
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,626
Dude!
Somebody has got to go down!

112
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,424
- What are you up to?
- Hey, fellas!

113
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,383
I'm just watching the Kardashians!

114
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:09,303
<i>Today, my sisters and I
are going to have to wash something.</i>

115
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:10,804
<i>It's gonna blow!</i>

116
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,266
Kim Kardashian is so sexy.

117
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:16,060
Her butt is like
a big mountain of pudding.

118
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:19,105
- Listen, you are in big trouble.
- I am?

119
00:07:19,438 --> 00:07:21,732
You remember that book you wrote?
Stan's mom found it.

120
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,152
Which book was that?

121
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,904
The book you left with us
when you were sleepwalking last night!

122
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,322
I don't even remember!

123
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,701
But it all makes sense now.

124
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:35,163
Ever since I read <i>Catcher in the Rye,</i>
I've been having these...

125
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,497
blackouts,

126
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,750
crazy thoughts
of wanting to kill the phonies!

127
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:43,754
I must have channeled all my angst
into dark writings in my sleep!

128
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:48,176
All right, boys.
We need to get to the bottom of this.

129
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:52,096
We've all read the book now.
It's very shocking, to say the least.

130
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,516
Actually,
it was all written by Butters.

131
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,143
That's right.

132
00:07:58,769 --> 00:07:59,770
Is that true?

133
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,773
I barely even remember it,
but I know I did.

134
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,443
We think...

135
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,487
that this is one of the best books
we've ever read!

136
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,490
- What?
- Really amazing.

137
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:12,991
Thanks!

138
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,745
We were actually
so moved by your book,

139
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,248
that we brought Mr. Nadelbaum
from Penguin Publishing to read it.

140
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:22,877
Mr. Butters,
we would like to offer you a deal

141
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:26,172
for first publishing rights
to your brilliant novel.

142
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:27,965
Wait a minute.
That's ours!

143
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,383
We wrote that!

144
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,802
Okay, boys.
You already told the truth.

145
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,264
We really did write it.
Tell them, Butters.

146
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,474
I wrote that.

147
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,811
- He's so young!
- Amazing!

148
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:40,937
What?

149
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:46,192
It is being called the most disgusting,
foul, sickening book ever written,

150
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:49,111
and it is also being called
literary genius.

151
00:08:49,236 --> 00:08:52,698
<i>The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs</i>
hit the shelves this weekend,

152
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,116
and so far, no one

153
00:08:54,241 --> 00:08:57,035
has been able to get through
the first paragraph without vomiting.

154
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,461
The book has already sold
millions of copies worldwide,

155
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:09,006
and has been translated
into 26 languages.

156
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,788
The book is changing
the literary world

157
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:44,583
and it is all thanks
to Leopold Butters Stotch.

158
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:50,715
Here he comes!

159
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,343
- Amazing book!
- Thank you!

160
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:57,304
- You changed my life, young man.
- That's nice!

161
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:05,313
What the fuck
do you think you're doing?

162
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,523
Just enjoying myself.
Why, Eric?

163
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:10,443
You know goddamn well
you didn't write that book!

164
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,569
But you told me I did!

165
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,072
That was when we thought
we'd get in trouble, asshole!

166
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:16,782
Leave Butters alone.

167
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,578
- He's a very fragile artist.
- He's so brooding and full of angst.

168
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,079
I'm brooding.

169
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,790
He doesn't deserve credit
for <i>Scrotie McBoogerballs</i>!

170
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:26,083
We deserve it all!

171
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,709
You guys are pathetic.

172
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:30,713
Get a life and stop mooching
off of others' success for once.

173
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,381
God dammit!

174
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,176
Do you really think
it's fair to lie like this?

175
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:39,221
- Let me tell you that if you don't...
- Let me tell you something, fellas!

176
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,015
You always take advantage of me,

177
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,768
and after reading <i>Catcher in the Rye,</i>
I've learned you're nothin' but phonies!

178
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:46,771
I'm not letting you
trick me this time!

179
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,523
So the four of you
can just suck on my wiener!

180
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,944
That inconsiderate jerk!

181
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,990
<i>Today on </i>Today.

182
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:02,078
<i>We meet the author of the book
that has swept the nation</i>

183
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:05,038
<i>and has now spawned
TV's most popular game show!</i>

184
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:08,918
<i>How long can you listen
to </i>Scrotie McBoogerballs

185
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,919
<i>and not vomit?</i>

186
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,636
<i>The book is full
of disgusting words and acts,</i>

187
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,513
<i>including Sarah Jessica Parker,</i>

188
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,598
<i>who is mentioned 465 times.</i>

189
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:27,937
Are you upset your wife
is made fun of so much in the book?

190
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:32,608
Obviously, it's wrong to make fun
of anybody's physical appearance.

191
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:36,654
My wife is a beautiful woman,
and most people agree with me.

192
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:40,491
And Matthew, how come a transvestite
donkey witch is standing next to you,

193
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,493
and why is it wearing a dress?

194
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:46,288
Joining us now is the author,
Leopold Stotch,

195
00:11:46,413 --> 00:11:47,873
along with his parents.

196
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,833
- Hello, Matt!
- Hi, everyone!

197
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:51,711
You must be
pretty proud of your son.

198
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:55,131
<i>We certainly are!
We're thrilled he's so talented.</i>

199
00:11:55,422 --> 00:11:58,342
We also understand
that your son is grounded, is he?

200
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,095
We had to ground him
for the language in the novel.

201
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,014
I come right to my room
after school.

202
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,141
But we are very proud nonetheless.

203
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,601
Now that you're a respected author,

204
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:10,354
- have you met any famous people?
- <i>Not yet,</i>

205
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:13,524
but as soon as I'm not grounded,
I'm hoping to meet Kim Kardashian!

206
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,192
I wanna jump on her belly.

207
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,402
All right.

208
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,739
My favorite part was
when Scrotie McBoogerballs

209
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,740
slid his head up into the horse's...

210
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:43,763
Sorry. Was that chapter
a slam on health care reform

211
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,347
as people have suggested?

212
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:48,642
Pretty much.
I think so.

213
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:52,021
Is that why the doctor character
pulls out all the stringy...

214
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:09,163
Are you ever worried
somebody might take your book wrong

215
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,249
and try to kill someone like
when that guy tried to shoot R. Reagan

216
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,042
after reading <i>Catcher in the Rye</i>?

217
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,213
Is that who the book
was telling me to kill?

218
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,090
Kill Ronald Reagan!

219
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,345
Ronald Reagan is dead now.

220
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,806
<i>Really?
Gosh, dangit.</i>

221
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,560
More and more of us
are against this book every day.

222
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:33,687
The author is cruel and offensive.

223
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,731
And for these reasons,

224
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:38,358
we demand this book be banned
from all schools, stores

225
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,735
and libraries.
This book is nothing, but smut

226
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,947
and vulgarity purely
for the sake of smut and vulgarity!

227
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:48,034
That's just because you're too young
to understand the underlying themes.

228
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:51,621
There are no underlying themes!
We know that for a fact!

229
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,374
You just failed to understand
what the author meant.

230
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:57,752
The author meant to be as gross
as possible, because it was funny!

231
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,630
That is such a simplistic view.

232
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:03,884
There is no deeper meaning.
Read it again!

233
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:07,721
So you're suggesting
that the author arbitrarily made fun

234
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:10,390
of Sarah Jessica Parker
for no reason?

235
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,143
But what would be the point?

236
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:14,645
There's is no point!

237
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,606
It's just because
Sarah Jessica Parker is fucking ugly!

238
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:18,815
No writer

239
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,277
would take the time
to make fun of Sarah Jessica Parker

240
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,278
just because they think she's ugly.

241
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,072
- Yes, they would!
- It is because

242
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,033
she is a metaphor in the book

243
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:30,244
for oppression
felt by the lower class.

244
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:31,745
What?

245
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,663
That is not in the book at all!

246
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,457
This book is an important look

247
00:14:35,582 --> 00:14:37,459
at how liberals
are hurting this country...

248
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:39,086
Scrotie McBoogerballs

249
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,755
is the most conservative-hating
liberal in literature!

250
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:42,964
What did you read?

251
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,175
There's nothing about that!

252
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,761
Then why does
Jessica Parker's butt cheese

253
00:14:47,886 --> 00:14:49,722
end up in Scrotie's milkshake?

254
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:55,227
Breaking news
from acclaimed author Leopold Stotch.

255
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:58,731
The artist has announced
that he is working on a second novel,

256
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,817
as a follow up
to his wildly successful best seller.

257
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:05,154
We got a statement from the writer,
who is still grounded in his room.

258
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:09,366
Can you give the public any idea
what the new book is about?

259
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,453
It's kind of
about love and betrayal.

260
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,788
The inner workings
of the human mind.

261
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,666
Will it be as sick and disgusting
as your first book?

262
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,418
It's raunchy all right!

263
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:22,463
I know what my readers want
and I'm going to deliver!

264
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,883
Away from the window!
You are being grounded!

265
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:29,011
Sorry, I was just bein'
the voice of a generation.

266
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,264
I can't believe
they won't ban our book!

267
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:35,601
I know! It's so much worse
than Catcher in the retarded Rye!

268
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,269
<i>It's fucking disgusting!</i>

269
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,189
All right,
I know what we have to do.

270
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,776
We've got to kill
Sarah Jessica Parker.

271
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,527
- What?
- Think about it!

272
00:15:45,652 --> 00:15:47,363
If somebody kills her,

273
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:50,115
they'll assume somebody did it
because of what was in the book.

274
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,660
- Then the book will get banned.
- We're not killing her!

275
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,330
Be right with you!

276
00:15:56,831 --> 00:16:00,251
We don't have to kill her.
We can just help her get killed.

277
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,627
Shut up!

278
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,753
Just face it.
We lost this one!

279
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,636
We only have to help her get killed
and we totally get back at Butters.

280
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,721
<i>Okay</i>.

281
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,057
Miss Jessica Parker!
Over here.

282
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,940
The day has finally arrived,
the eagerly-awaited second novel

283
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,150
from the author
of <i>Scrotie McBoogerballs</i>

284
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:28,904
hit the shelves this morning,
and apparently bookstores are jammed.

285
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,614
Al, how is it out there?

286
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:32,825
I don't know
if you can see this, guys,

287
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,703
but the line stretches
all the way around the block.

288
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,454
People waiting for their turn

289
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:40,040
to get inside the book store
and read the novel.

290
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,960
They've brought trash bags
and buckets to throw up in,

291
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,629
just a festive atmosphere here,
Matt and Meredith.

292
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:47,798
We've got
our vomit buckets ready too,

293
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:50,717
because coming up,
a very special in-studio treat.

294
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,220
That's right,
we are going to have a reading

295
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:56,765
of the first five chapters of the book
live in our studio!

296
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:59,810
We must warn you
that this is from the same author

297
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:02,938
who wrote the most graphic,
obscene novel of all time,

298
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,815
so brace yourselves
for some harsh language.

299
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,026
Take it away, Morgan Freeman!

300
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,280
<i>The Poop that took a Pee.</i>

301
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,240
"Chapter One."

302
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,367
"Douglas had to poop.

303
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:19,621
"His butt was all stinky
because he had to poop so badly.

304
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:23,083
"There was a gross woman
named Rebecca

305
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,378
"who was sunbathing all naked
and she was fat.

306
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:29,673
"Douglas walked up to her and said,

307
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:31,341
"I need to poop.

308
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,594
"Okay, Rebecca replied.

309
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,262
"I like poop.

310
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,723
"Douglas squatted down...

311
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,601
"over the fat sunbathing lady

312
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,352
"and went poop.

313
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:46,023
"The poop,
sat there on Rebecca's boobs,

314
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,900
"looking like a wiener."

315
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,069
"Chapter Two."

316
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:55,490


317
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,790
- See any hunters yet?
- <i>Not yet.</i>

318
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:08,253
Doing good Miss Jessica Parker,
just hang out right there.

319
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,172
Guys! Stop!

320
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,467
We don't have to do this!

321
00:18:14,509 --> 00:18:17,095
- Butters wrote a second book!
- So what?

322
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,889
If he wrote a second book

323
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:21,350
they'll know
he couldn't have written the first one!

324
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,310
We can get people to believe us now.

325
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:24,811
Dude, sweet!

326
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,566
"Why are we here,

327
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,652
"Douglas cried,

328
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,904
"as poop came out his wiener

329
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,531
"in a long, thin strip.

330
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:38,951
"It was

331
00:18:39,534 --> 00:18:40,661
"wiener poop.

332
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,747
<i>"Which is the grossest poop of all."</i>

333
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,583
"The pee pee got on the woman's leg

334
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,669
"and she screamed

335
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,962
"pooping out her boobs."

336
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:54,341
"And so, when the pee
got mixed with the poop

337
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,134
"it smelled like a butt."

338
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,012
This is even lamer than we thought!

339
00:18:59,137 --> 00:19:00,973
People are gonna want Butters' head!

340
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,099
Are you reading this?
What do you think?

341
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,310
So far, I think it's incredible.

342
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,437
It might be better
than his first book.

343
00:19:07,562 --> 00:19:09,356
I agree it wasn't as edgy,

344
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:12,150
but it's like
he's gone back to his roots.

345
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,736
- What?
- You can't be serious! You like this?

346
00:19:14,861 --> 00:19:16,780
Some of the imagery is unbelievable.

347
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:19,283
A woman pooping out her boobs
is not good imagery!

348
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,994
Says you.
You must be a pro-life nut, huh?

349
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,912
Didn't like
what the book had to say?

350
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:27,165
What are you talking about?
This book is as pro-life as it gets.

351
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,751
- Come on!
- God dammit!

352
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:33,505
Will you people stop
reading into stuff that isn't there?

353
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,842
"And the poop and the pee
lived happily ever after.

354
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:37,968
"The end."

355
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,595
Kill the phonies!

356
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:47,019
Today my sisters and I
are going to shop for underwear!

357
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,938
Can I go with you girls?

358
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,574
Our nation is still reeling

359
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,285
from the tragic deaths
of the Kardashians.

360
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:06,955
The shooter claims he was driven
to commit the slaughter,

361
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,083
immediately after reading
<i>The Poop that took a Pee</i>

362
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,544
by Leopold Butters Stotch.

363
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:14,713
It's all over.

364
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,548
The Kardashians...

365
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:18,216
wiped out,

366
00:20:18,925 --> 00:20:20,344
in the blink of an eye.

367
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,929
All because one little...

368
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,181
prick...

369
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,641
had to go and write a book.

370
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,519
<i>Leopold Stotch.</i>

371
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,064
<i>I hope they bury you!</i>

372
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,150
You evil fucker!

373
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,114
Dude, people are pissed off at you.

374
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:42,616
I know.

375
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,244
They're saying they're gonna ban
both your books, completely!

376
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,120
You're not making any more money!

377
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,373
You think I care about that?

378
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:54,503
My writing got the most
beautiful woman in the world killed!

379
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,172
I loved her!

380
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,674
And now she's gone
and it's because of me!

381
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,845
It'll be all right.

382
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:07,015
We've all learned
that people look for meaning in books.

383
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,976
And sometimes,
even if it isn't there,

384
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,061
they'll try and invent
their own meaning.

385
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:15,107
That's why we all need to avoid books
and stick to television.

386
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:18,944
Thanks, fellas.
I'll definitely never write again.

387
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,613
I think I can get over this.

388
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,825
That's good, because we need
to tell you something.

389
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,952
- What?
- You were sleepwalking again

390
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,538
and dressed
Jessica Parker up in a moose suit.

391
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:32,040
You left her in the forest
and she got shot by a hunter.

392
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,166
What?

393
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,253
Sorry. You're gonna have
to come down and admit it was you.

394
00:21:36,711 --> 00:21:38,255
I got her killed too?

395
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,966
At least, she was ugly.
