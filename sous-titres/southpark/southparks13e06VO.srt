Season 13 Episode 6
"Pinewood Derby"

2
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,970
All right.
That's 2.8 centimeters.

3
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,177
Should give us a drag
of only 0.6 milliseconds.

4
00:00:38,302 --> 00:00:39,767
Hold the front here, Stan.

5
00:00:41,794 --> 00:00:44,423
- Guys, it's almost 2:00 A.M.
- We know.

6
00:00:44,548 --> 00:00:46,003
It's way past time for bed.

7
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:49,038
Stan's Pinewood Derby race
is tomorrow!

8
00:00:49,163 --> 00:00:51,972
Do you have any idea
how important this is to him?

9
00:00:52,097 --> 00:00:55,764
Stan is not gonna lose
to the goddamn Hollises again!

10
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,032
It's just a block of wood
and some wheels.

11
00:00:58,157 --> 00:00:59,767
There's not much more you can do.

12
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:02,517
That's 'cause you're a chick!
Now just leave us alone!

13
00:01:03,043 --> 00:01:06,401
Don't worry, son. The Hollises
are not beating us this year.

14
00:01:06,526 --> 00:01:10,152
I went and got something to put inside
our car and make it go extra fast!

15
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,614
We can't add anything to the car
that doesn't come in the approved kit.

16
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:16,167
How do you think the Hollises
beat us every year?

17
00:01:16,292 --> 00:01:20,234
They put lead in the wood or something.
We're just leveling the playing field.

18
00:01:21,108 --> 00:01:22,665
- There.
- What is it?

19
00:01:23,145 --> 00:01:24,710
It's... it's nothing really.

20
00:01:25,768 --> 00:01:27,153
Tom, I'm standing outside

21
00:01:27,278 --> 00:01:30,413
the Hadron Particle Super Collider
in Switzerland,

22
00:01:30,538 --> 00:01:33,691
where authorities are shocked
and baffled over the theft

23
00:01:33,816 --> 00:01:35,745
of a super conducting bending magnet

24
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:38,556
created for use in tests
with particle acceleration.

25
00:01:39,096 --> 00:01:40,349
Oh, no. He didn't.

26
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:43,731
The superconducting magnet
was stolen sometime last week.

27
00:01:43,856 --> 00:01:46,882
Surveillance cameras were able
to record the theft on tape

28
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:48,853
and police are now looking for...

29
00:01:48,978 --> 00:01:51,485
Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan.

30
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:54,238
Caught here in these photos,
the troubled rebel princess

31
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:56,331
is seen taking
the superconducting magnet

32
00:01:56,456 --> 00:01:59,410
and then appearing disorientated
as she tries to find her way out.

33
00:02:00,325 --> 00:02:02,765
If you have any information
of Princess Leia's whereabouts,

34
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,999
please call
your local police department.

35
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,670
<i>All right, scouts and dads.
The racing continues.</i>

36
00:02:09,154 --> 00:02:11,714
And it looks like
our next heat is ready to go.

37
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,974
Three, two, one, race!

38
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:19,502
2.1 seconds for Tommy Bretz!

39
00:02:19,627 --> 00:02:21,515
Looks like we have
a new leader, folks.

40
00:02:21,804 --> 00:02:22,892
All right!

41
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:27,897
All right. We're gonna need to check in
and have our car inspected to qualify.

42
00:02:28,324 --> 00:02:29,369
Now, son.

43
00:02:29,494 --> 00:02:32,872
Daddy needs to teach you
something very important about tales.

44
00:02:32,997 --> 00:02:33,997
Tales?

45
00:02:34,122 --> 00:02:36,732
When you tell them
you only used the approved kit,

46
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:40,409
don't look up and away, don't rub
your neck and don't touch your ear.

47
00:02:40,637 --> 00:02:42,722
Otherwise, they'll know
you're lying to them.

48
00:02:42,847 --> 00:02:46,791
When you lie, just don't look away,
rub your neck or touch your ear.

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,460
Maybe we should just take out
the thing you put in the car...

50
00:02:50,491 --> 00:02:53,917
You have to learn how to lie correctly
some day. Might as well be today.

51
00:02:55,059 --> 00:02:56,359
I love you, son.

52
00:02:57,428 --> 00:03:00,005
Looks good.
Thank you and good luck today.

53
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,639
All right. Next, please.

54
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:04,517
- Name?
- It's... Marsh.

55
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:11,280
All right.
Car weighs in at 15 ounces.

56
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:14,901
Do you hereby swear that you used
parts in the official Pinewood Derby kit

57
00:03:15,026 --> 00:03:17,404
and only parts in
the official Pinewood Derby kit?

58
00:03:18,578 --> 00:03:20,128
Yes, I do. Yes, I do.

59
00:03:20,777 --> 00:03:21,784
Yes, I do.

60
00:03:22,148 --> 00:03:24,059
All right, young man.
Good luck today.

61
00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:29,382
Well. Look, son, it's the Marshes.

62
00:03:29,632 --> 00:03:31,985
Hey, Hollis. You guys race already?

63
00:03:32,235 --> 00:03:34,435
No, little Emmett hasn't gone yet.

64
00:03:34,572 --> 00:03:36,590
Think they're saving
the best for last.

65
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:39,944
Clocked her in at home
at 1.5 seconds.

66
00:03:40,194 --> 00:03:42,470
It's the fastest car
we've ever built.

67
00:03:42,595 --> 00:03:43,848
1.5?

68
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,768
The time to beat is 1.9 seconds.

69
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,568
May we please have...

70
00:03:48,968 --> 00:03:50,677
Brewster, Marsh,

71
00:03:50,927 --> 00:03:52,327
Jarvis and Hollis.

72
00:03:55,567 --> 00:03:59,571
Only fitting our boys should be going
head-to-head for their match, hey?

73
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:01,657
Come on, Stan.
You can do this!

74
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:04,946
All right, kids, are you ready?

75
00:04:05,071 --> 00:04:07,413
Here we go. Last race
for the state championship in...

76
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:10,583
three, two, one, go!

77
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:15,669
You got it, Emmett!

78
00:04:35,027 --> 00:04:36,577
Suck on that, Hollis!

79
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:39,695
<i>This is 9 news at 10:00.</i>

80
00:04:40,043 --> 00:04:41,655
A Colorado boy and his father

81
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,579
have set a new record
at the Pinewood Derby.

82
00:04:44,704 --> 00:04:47,609
Stan and Randy Marsh
not only broke a speed record,

83
00:04:47,734 --> 00:04:50,042
but actually appear
to have bent time and space

84
00:04:50,167 --> 00:04:51,832
and discovered warp speed.

85
00:04:52,328 --> 00:04:54,710
<i>A parade was held for
the winners earlier today.</i>

86
00:04:55,037 --> 00:04:56,666
<i>And already offers for commercials</i>

87
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:59,924
<i>and endorsement deals for the father
and son appear to be pouring in.</i>

88
00:05:01,192 --> 00:05:03,896
Dad, I just you to know
I still love you.

89
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,529
He's OK! He's OK!

90
00:05:46,627 --> 00:05:48,227
- Stan Marsh?
- Yeah?

91
00:05:48,472 --> 00:05:50,827
I'm agent Clark
and this is agent Marx.

92
00:05:50,952 --> 00:05:53,811
We'd like to talk to you about
your Pinewood Derby car.

93
00:05:54,349 --> 00:05:55,670
Crap. Dad!

94
00:05:58,282 --> 00:06:02,003
Young man, what we're about to tell you
is a matter of national security.

95
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:05,928
Yesterday, every government on earth
was contacted by...

96
00:06:06,251 --> 00:06:08,910
- an alien life force.
- Alien?

97
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,202
Apparently the alien came across
your Pinewood Derby car

98
00:06:12,327 --> 00:06:15,165
- and is now heading here to our planet.
- What does it want?

99
00:06:15,512 --> 00:06:19,516
We believe they'll welcome us into
the Galactic Federation of Planets.

100
00:06:19,668 --> 00:06:23,090
They'll want to meet the people who
discovered warp speed for our species.

101
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:26,260
Stan, did you use all the damn
toilet paper again? Crap!

102
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:29,811
What? What do you guys want?
We only used what was in the kit!

103
00:06:29,936 --> 00:06:33,502
You got nothing on us!
You got nothing on us!

104
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:35,129
Dad, they aren't here for that!

105
00:06:36,072 --> 00:06:37,274
Hi, I'm Randy Marsh.

106
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:39,997
Mr. Marsh, we were just telling
your son that thanks to you,

107
00:06:40,122 --> 00:06:42,371
we have made
first contact with alien life.

108
00:06:42,826 --> 00:06:43,826
What?

109
00:06:44,167 --> 00:06:45,676
Hey, Sharon!

110
00:06:45,801 --> 00:06:47,737
NASA has confirmed
that an alien ship

111
00:06:47,862 --> 00:06:50,528
has entered our solar system
and is headed here.

112
00:06:50,653 --> 00:06:51,864
So guess what?

113
00:06:52,114 --> 00:06:54,996
Our Pinewood Derby car
found alien life in space.

114
00:06:55,121 --> 00:06:56,471
What? Oh, my God!

115
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:59,668
Yeah. But I guess it's just a dumb race
like you said, huh, Sharon?

116
00:07:11,246 --> 00:07:14,942
The world holds its breath
as an alien ship prepares to land.

117
00:07:15,192 --> 00:07:17,420
Now that our planet
has achieved warp speed,

118
00:07:17,545 --> 00:07:20,481
we are about to be welcomed
into the universal society.

119
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:24,106
All thanks to a father and son
who broke the warp barrier,

120
00:07:24,231 --> 00:07:27,613
using only the parts
in this Pinewood Derby car kit.

121
00:07:28,128 --> 00:07:31,189
Mr. Marsh, you are on
with all the world leaders.

122
00:07:32,248 --> 00:07:35,040
- Hello?
- Godspeed, Mr. Marsh.

123
00:07:35,165 --> 00:07:36,830
The nation of France is with you!

124
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,223
Good luck with alien, Mr. Marsh!

125
00:07:39,473 --> 00:07:41,376
Please say hello from China!

126
00:07:41,797 --> 00:07:45,536
OK. Stand by.
I think it's... I think it's landing.

127
00:07:58,894 --> 00:08:02,398
Our first encounter
with alien life is about to happen.

128
00:08:02,684 --> 00:08:04,775
<i>Will it be like
in </i>Star Trek: First Contact?

129
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:07,861
<i>Or will it be more like
</i>Contact<i> with Jodie Foster?

130
00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:26,105
I seek the life forms
that made this.

131
00:08:27,351 --> 00:08:29,001
That's ours, Mr. Alien.

132
00:08:29,668 --> 00:08:31,885
We are the Marshes, Randy and Stan.

133
00:08:32,327 --> 00:08:33,327
Oh, yeah?

134
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:36,471
You're gonna build me
another one, see?

135
00:08:37,848 --> 00:08:39,101
He's got a gun!

136
00:08:39,425 --> 00:08:41,407
Everyone down on the ground!

137
00:08:41,532 --> 00:08:44,273
Get those hands up!
Let me see those hands, do it now!

138
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,567
I mean it. Show me those hands!

139
00:08:47,002 --> 00:08:48,930
I'm Baby Fark McGee-zax!

140
00:08:49,055 --> 00:08:52,114
The greatest gangster
this universe has ever seen, right?

141
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,782
You can't threaten us!

142
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:56,452
Who wants it next?

143
00:08:58,386 --> 00:09:00,622
<i>Anyone else on this planet
wanna be a hero?</i>

144
00:09:04,186 --> 00:09:06,467
- What do you want?
- I'm on the lam!

145
00:09:06,592 --> 00:09:08,718
I got the entire
Federation of Planets after me,

146
00:09:08,843 --> 00:09:10,690
but they ain't gonna catch me,
you got that?

147
00:09:10,815 --> 00:09:14,511
They might have busted my warp drive,
but you know how to make 'em!

148
00:09:16,521 --> 00:09:19,141
Screw this guy!
He can't take out all of us!

149
00:09:21,444 --> 00:09:24,521
I can kill any mug
on this two bit planet I want!

150
00:09:27,051 --> 00:09:30,235
You build me a new warp drive
or you'll all gonna get it, see?

151
00:09:30,732 --> 00:09:32,993
Fine! He can build you
what you want.

152
00:09:33,118 --> 00:09:36,116
All he needs is the official
Pinewood Derby kit. Right, Marsh?

153
00:09:37,837 --> 00:09:40,787
That's all we need, huh Stan?
Oh, boy.

154
00:09:45,273 --> 00:09:47,862
OK, let's put
the wheels on now, son.

155
00:09:48,302 --> 00:09:50,422
What's taking so long?
You're stalling!

156
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,425
Come on, build him the warp drive
and he'll leave us alone!

157
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,760
We're working on it!

158
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,838
Dad, you know we can't make
the car go as fast as before

159
00:09:58,963 --> 00:10:00,913
with only the approved
Pinewood Derby kit.

160
00:10:01,038 --> 00:10:02,490
Thanks, Stan. I know that!

161
00:10:02,615 --> 00:10:04,896
We have to tell him
we used something outside the kit!

162
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,272
Do you have any idea
how stupid that will make us look?

163
00:10:07,855 --> 00:10:09,246
All right. That does it!

164
00:10:11,988 --> 00:10:15,309
- Hello?
- He blew up our government building!

165
00:10:15,434 --> 00:10:16,782
You've got to hurry!

166
00:10:17,093 --> 00:10:19,743
Mr. Marsh, why won't you
finish the Pinewood Derby car?

167
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:22,211
Will you just give us a minute, gal!

168
00:10:22,712 --> 00:10:24,474
Come on, dad. We gotta come clean!

169
00:10:31,052 --> 00:10:34,091
- Zats! It's the intergalactic police!
- What?

170
00:10:37,828 --> 00:10:40,847
You better get rid of 'em
or your whole planet is gonna get it.

171
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,226
You tell 'em you ain't seen nothing.
You got that?

172
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,227
I ain't going to space jail!

173
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:54,166
Excuse us, earthlings,

174
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:57,941
but we've been in pursuit
of a criminal from the Xenon Galaxy.

175
00:10:58,383 --> 00:11:01,028
Fella by the name
of Baby Fark McGee-zax.

176
00:11:03,932 --> 00:11:05,414
We haven't seen anything.

177
00:11:05,737 --> 00:11:08,500
You think anyone else
on your planet might have seen him?

178
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,754
Actually, I happen to be on the phone
with all the world leaders. I can ask.

179
00:11:13,093 --> 00:11:15,890
Yeah, listen,
these police aliens are here,

180
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,641
and they're wondering
if anyone has seen an alien named

181
00:11:18,766 --> 00:11:20,178
Baby Fark McGee-zax.

182
00:11:21,202 --> 00:11:23,196
No, we haven't seen aliens.

183
00:11:23,872 --> 00:11:25,851
We've seen nothing here in France.

184
00:11:26,379 --> 00:11:28,791
Sorry, nobody in the world
has seen anything.

185
00:11:30,076 --> 00:11:32,649
What did this criminal alien do,
exactly?

186
00:11:32,962 --> 00:11:36,955
He stole over 600 parsons of space cash
from the universal bank.

187
00:11:37,549 --> 00:11:40,282
You're absolutely sure
you didn't see an alien land here?

188
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:42,665
- We're sure.
- So then...

189
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,537
We're the first aliens
you've ever seen?

190
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,164
Right. You're the first ones.

191
00:11:47,527 --> 00:11:51,293
You don't seem that excited about
your first contact with alien life.

192
00:11:53,082 --> 00:11:54,832
That's right! Oh, my God!

193
00:11:55,418 --> 00:11:57,716
Everybody,
we just made first contact!

194
00:11:58,144 --> 00:12:01,741
If you do see any sign
of the other alien or the space cash...

195
00:12:01,866 --> 00:12:05,409
- We will give you a call!
- Mathematical semitonal is fine.

196
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,653
- Something wrong, sir?
- I don't know, Daverd.

197
00:12:18,022 --> 00:12:21,122
Just something
about that planet didn't feel right.

198
00:12:23,745 --> 00:12:27,512
All right, son. Now you just paint
that racing stripe like you did before.

199
00:12:27,637 --> 00:12:30,598
I don't need it painted.
I just need it functional, right?

200
00:12:30,723 --> 00:12:32,317
The right paint job is a big part

201
00:12:32,442 --> 00:12:34,336
of what makes
a Pinewood Derby car go fast.

202
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:35,879
That's true.

203
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:38,234
I swear if you don't have
that thing working in 3 minutes

204
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:39,966
this whole planet is done for!

205
00:12:40,755 --> 00:12:43,600
Dad, it's over.
We have to tell everyone we cheated.

206
00:12:43,725 --> 00:12:47,525
No, I've got it all figured out, son.
You have to kill the alien.

207
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,190
Kill the alien?

208
00:12:49,315 --> 00:12:52,111
I've been filing down
this piece of metal into a shank.

209
00:12:52,236 --> 00:12:54,139
I'm gonna call him over here
to look at the car.

210
00:12:54,264 --> 00:12:56,640
- When I do, you shove that in his neck.
- No, dad!

211
00:12:56,765 --> 00:12:59,536
- We don't even know what will happen!
- What are you whispering about?

212
00:12:59,661 --> 00:13:03,056
No. That's it.
We're done! Here, come take a look.

213
00:13:03,181 --> 00:13:04,794
- Dad!
- Here, see?

214
00:13:05,353 --> 00:13:07,553
Look real close at the axles here.

215
00:13:21,281 --> 00:13:23,009
All right, you got him, son!

216
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,014
All right. Check the ship!

217
00:13:31,107 --> 00:13:34,729
See, Stan? What did daddy tell you?
Everything worked out.

218
00:13:34,854 --> 00:13:37,640
I guess so.
It just still doesn't feel right.

219
00:13:37,765 --> 00:13:40,883
But, Stan, it's over now.
We'll never have to lie again.

220
00:13:41,276 --> 00:13:42,726
Marsh, get in here!

221
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:48,535
- Can you believe it?
- Oh, my God.

222
00:13:49,841 --> 00:13:51,437
Space cash.

223
00:13:52,366 --> 00:13:54,356
Looks like
those alien cops were right.

224
00:13:54,481 --> 00:13:56,763
- Guess you should call them back now.
- Right.

225
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,550
Or what if we didn't call the cops?

226
00:14:01,313 --> 00:14:04,070
I mean, this is
a lot of space cash, guys.

227
00:14:04,396 --> 00:14:06,273
- Think what we could do with it.
- No, dad.

228
00:14:06,398 --> 00:14:09,127
He's right.
We don't have to call the police back.

229
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,776
All right.
Let's get the cash, put it into boxes.

230
00:14:15,034 --> 00:14:17,427
- Dad, what are you doing?
- Will you relax, Stan?

231
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:22,527
Don't sink that you get to keep
all the space cash for yourselves.

232
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,695
That's right.

233
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,782
This is all of our planet,
the space cash belongs to all of us!

234
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:30,115
Either America shares that space cash
with the rest of the world

235
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,995
or we will tell the space cops!

236
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,998
All right, fine. Look, there's plenty
of space cash to go around.

237
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,492
Thanks to us,
our planet is rich, son!

238
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:49,598
No, China.
We get to keep the ship.

239
00:14:49,986 --> 00:14:52,486
Because we killed
the alien, you boner.

240
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:53,955
Come on, England.

241
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,696
You got just as much
of the space cash as everyone else!

242
00:15:00,254 --> 00:15:02,234
Crap! It's the cops.
Hang on.

243
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,160
Hey, space officers.

244
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,497
Looks like the alien criminal
did land here after all.

245
00:15:15,834 --> 00:15:18,180
Oh, that? You were
talking about that alien?

246
00:15:18,305 --> 00:15:22,087
Yeah, that one. He was here.
He landed here, but... we killed him.

247
00:15:22,636 --> 00:15:25,173
And so did you find
the missing space cash?

248
00:15:26,803 --> 00:15:29,636
Space cash?
No, there wasn't any space cash.

249
00:15:30,585 --> 00:15:33,431
Maybe someone else
on your planet knows where it is.

250
00:15:33,811 --> 00:15:36,661
Any of you other countries
see any space cash?

251
00:15:37,601 --> 00:15:39,104
- No space cash.
- Not at all.

252
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,189
- No.
- No space cash.

253
00:15:41,619 --> 00:15:43,775
Doesn't look like
the space cash was ever here.

254
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:47,988
Guess he must have dropped it off
at some other planet.

255
00:15:48,377 --> 00:15:49,660
Probably!

256
00:15:50,144 --> 00:15:51,994
You folk all take care now.

257
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,525
Just one more thing, earthlings.

258
00:15:57,245 --> 00:15:59,492
We had some images done
of your planet and it appears

259
00:15:59,617 --> 00:16:02,455
that one of your poorer
countries, Mexico,

260
00:16:02,925 --> 00:16:04,598
has built 32 new hospitals

261
00:16:04,723 --> 00:16:07,465
and seven water parks
in the last four days.

262
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,141
Yeah, Mexico, you know...

263
00:16:12,266 --> 00:16:14,528
All us other countries
chipped in and...

264
00:16:14,653 --> 00:16:16,786
gave Mexico some aid.
They really needed...

265
00:16:17,312 --> 00:16:18,518
new water parks.

266
00:16:20,942 --> 00:16:22,242
Have a good day.

267
00:16:28,896 --> 00:16:32,115
Mexico, we said no spending
the space cash yet!

268
00:16:33,045 --> 00:16:34,159
What are you doing?

269
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:37,412
Will some country that speaks Spanish
yell at them? They'll ruin everything!

270
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:17,382
No, Japan! Will you listen
to me for five seconds?

271
00:17:17,507 --> 00:17:20,789
If you keep building giant robots,
the cops are gonna ask questions!

272
00:17:21,105 --> 00:17:24,125
Then why can England
build a nuclear power plant?

273
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,127
Nobody can build anything!

274
00:17:26,423 --> 00:17:28,100
It's not even gonna matter,

275
00:17:28,225 --> 00:17:30,966
because Finland is thinking
about telling the space cops the truth!

276
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:32,801
What? Finland!

277
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:36,430
We believe the aliens are going
to find out sooner or later what we did.

278
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,056
It's best we come clean now.

279
00:17:38,388 --> 00:17:41,810
Will you just relax, Finland?
Nobody's gonna find out anything.

280
00:17:42,178 --> 00:17:45,939
I'm sorry, but our nation is resolved.
We cannot live with the guilt anymore.

281
00:17:47,044 --> 00:17:49,124
You're right, Finland, OK?
You're right.

282
00:17:49,249 --> 00:17:52,070
Can you just let us other countries
talk in private for a moment?

283
00:17:52,517 --> 00:17:53,630
Very well.

284
00:17:54,376 --> 00:17:55,782
We gotta get rid of Finland.

285
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,618
We gotta take out Finland.
They gonna squeal.

286
00:17:58,972 --> 00:18:00,495
I think we all agree, guys.

287
00:18:18,262 --> 00:18:19,262
Dammit!

288
00:18:24,364 --> 00:18:26,604
Hey, space officers.
How can we help you?

289
00:18:26,904 --> 00:18:28,919
Well, we're a little puzzled.

290
00:18:29,044 --> 00:18:31,787
Over one of your countries...
Finland?

291
00:18:32,655 --> 00:18:33,862
What about it?

292
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:37,282
It appears to have been...
destroyed.

293
00:18:37,626 --> 00:18:40,388
What? Oh, my God! Not Finland!

294
00:18:40,513 --> 00:18:42,818
- Oh, no!
- Not Finland!

295
00:18:42,943 --> 00:18:44,539
Hey, guys, Finland's dead.

296
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,002
No! Not Finland!

297
00:18:49,384 --> 00:18:50,628
All of Finland gone!

298
00:18:50,935 --> 00:18:54,007
Somebody better break the news
to Norway. They were really close.

299
00:18:55,432 --> 00:18:58,136
None of you knew anything
about the Finland destruction?

300
00:18:58,396 --> 00:18:59,598
No. I mean...

301
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:02,515
Odds are they nuked themselves.
You know, suicide.

302
00:19:02,968 --> 00:19:05,060
We didn't say anything about nukes.

303
00:19:05,471 --> 00:19:07,854
Or... whatever they did, I'm saying.

304
00:19:09,163 --> 00:19:11,106
Excuse me! Excuse me!

305
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:14,155
Everyone, I have
an announcement to make.

306
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,667
I am giving back
my Pinewood Derby trophy.

307
00:19:16,792 --> 00:19:18,357
- What?
- Stan!

308
00:19:18,713 --> 00:19:21,713
The truth is...
I don't deserve this trophy,

309
00:19:22,377 --> 00:19:24,339
'cause I cheated
on my Pinewood Derby car.

310
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:26,414
I used something
not in the approved kit.

311
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,583
- What?
- Outside the kit?

312
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,543
Not in the approved kit?

313
00:19:30,938 --> 00:19:32,879
He cheated on the Pinewood Derby?

314
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,920
This trophy isn't mine.

315
00:19:35,209 --> 00:19:36,823
And so I have to give it back.

316
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,065
Because if I'm not honest now,

317
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,261
I'll have to keep
this lie going forever.

318
00:19:41,386 --> 00:19:43,056
And it will just grow and grow.

319
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:50,580
Stan, we're proud of you
for coming clean.

320
00:19:50,705 --> 00:19:53,566
But it doesn't change the fact
that you cheated. Go to your room, son.

321
00:19:53,974 --> 00:19:57,342
Your son seems to have
some pretty inspirational words.

322
00:19:57,467 --> 00:20:00,573
You sure you earthlings
have nothing else to tell us?

323
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:05,036
Do we have anything else
to tell the space cops?

324
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,815
- No changes.
- Tell 'em no.

325
00:20:11,372 --> 00:20:13,586
Yeah, no. We've told you
everything, space officers.

326
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:15,829
All right. That's it, then.

327
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,216
Come on out, sir.
It appears to be over.

328
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,225
Shit! It's Baby Fark McGee-zax!

329
00:20:28,028 --> 00:20:31,245
My real name is Kevirn Xaxor.

330
00:20:31,678 --> 00:20:34,149
I am the ambassador
to new planet testing.

331
00:20:36,128 --> 00:20:39,445
- What the hell are they talking about?
- These are not space cops.

332
00:20:40,111 --> 00:20:41,532
There is no space jail,

333
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:45,657
and space cash is only worth what you
as a planet decided it was worth.

334
00:20:48,097 --> 00:20:50,997
I mean, how stupid
is your species? Space jail?

335
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,293
Baby Fark McGee-zax?

336
00:20:53,821 --> 00:20:55,503
It was just a trick?

337
00:20:55,782 --> 00:20:58,421
Whenever a civilization
discovers warp speed,

338
00:20:58,546 --> 00:21:01,155
we want to bring them
into the Federation of Planets.

339
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,469
But first we do the space cash test,

340
00:21:03,594 --> 00:21:06,238
to see if that species
is worthy of joining.

341
00:21:06,363 --> 00:21:08,141
Needless to say, you all failed.

342
00:21:11,023 --> 00:21:14,105
People of Earth, since you did not
return the space cash,

343
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:17,267
your species and your planet
is hereby forever blocked off

344
00:21:17,392 --> 00:21:20,442
and barred from the rest
of the universe. Goodbye.

345
00:21:23,596 --> 00:21:25,033
No! Hey, wait! No!

346
00:21:36,434 --> 00:21:37,934
Well, that sucks.

347
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:39,984
