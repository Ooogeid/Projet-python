"Whales Whores"

00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,996
Alright, everyone.
Welcome to the dolphin encounter

3
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,747
here at the Denver Aquarium!

4
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,709
My name is Chad
and I'll be your guide and trainer

5
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:46,003
as you meet these intelligent,
and truly magical creatures.

6
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:49,549
And here they come.
This is Trigger, Dolly and Bubbles.{\*This is Trigger and Dolly. And there's Bubbles.}

7
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:55,596
- Pretty neat birthday, huh, Stan?
- This is gonna be awesome!

8
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,724
If they come near you,
you can touch their backs.

9
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:00,894
Just no grabbing, please.
What whimsical creatures, aren't they?

10
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:05,273
The dolphins you will be encountering{\* today}
are Atlantic bottlenose dolphins.

11
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,274
Now who'd like to get a kiss
from one?

12
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:10,737
- I would like to...
- Me! I wanna kiss it!

13
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:15,991
Alright. Let's just get you to put
your hands, palms down on the water.

14
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,829
What is that?

15
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:25,876
It's the Japanese!

16
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,639
Fuck you, dolphin!

17
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,933
Fuck you, dolphin!

18
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,569
These are our favorite animals
here at the Atlanta Zoo.

19
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:54,489
It's Dolly and Seamore.
They are beluga whales.

20
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,699
These whales live mostly
in the arctic...

21
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,042
Fuck you, whales!

22
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,222
Alright, Jessica.
Now put your arms out like this.

23
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,186
Great job, Jessica!

24
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:28,439
Fuck you, whale!

25
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,492
Hey, pal.

26
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:43,246
Sorry your birthday got a little ruined
by the Japanese.

27
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,498
Dad, why did they do that?

28
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,709
Well, Stan, the Japanese just...

29
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,378
don't really like dolphins
very much.

30
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,214
Certainly not as much
as us normal people do.

31
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,257
But, at least
you still got your t-shirt!

32
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,428
And you'll always have
your neat picture.

34
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:06,603
<i>Dan Dierdorf here welcoming you
to this great football matchup</i>

35
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:10,023

and the Miami Dolphins.</i>

36

<i>We're all set for kick-off and...</i>

37
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:17,988
Dan, it looks like some Japanese people
are now rushing onto the field.

38
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:23,577
<i>This is not the kind of thing
you want happening during kickoff.</i>

39
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,205
Fuck you, dolphin!

40
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:31,586
{\*Several }Whales and dolphins were again
slaughtered by the Japanese today.

41
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,839
This time at the Six Flags
Discovery Kingdom near San Francisco.

42
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:38,384
Aquariums had been experimenting
with methods to keep the Japanese out,

43
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:40,553
but so far nothing seems
to stop them.

44
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,806
When asked if all of Japan

45
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,433
supported the slaughtering
of whales and dolphins,

46
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,393
the current prime minister of Japan,

47
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:49,645
Yukio Hatoyama had this to say.

48
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,400
Fuck you, whale!

49
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:57,111
And Fuck you, dolphin!

50
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,637
Guys!

51
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:27,225
Look,
{\*I think }it's time for us to do something.

52
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,102
- This is all getting way out of hand.
- What{\* do you mean}? This song is sweet.

53
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,688
{\*No, }Not the song, {\*About }the Japanese
killing whales and dolphins.

54
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,274
- They've been doing that for long.
- So?

55
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,693
Don't you guys care?
We have to do something!

56
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,070
What can we do?

57
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,573
It's not like we can change
the way a country thinks.

58
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,408
I don't like it,
but it's just their way.

59
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,076
Everyone has an attitude of...

60
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:47,245
"that's the way they are"
and "that's the way it is".

61
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,747
Nobody likes it
but everyone's too busy to do anything.

62
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,666
I'm not too busy, Stan.

63
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,836
- You're not?
- No. I just don't care at all.

64
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:59,006
You don't care about whales
and dolphins being slaughtered?

65
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:02,552
Me and Kenny don't give two shits

66
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:05,179
about stupid ass whales.

67
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:11,019
When all the whales and dolphins
are gone, people are going to wish

68
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,564
that at some point, they took the time
to care just a little goddamn bit!

69

<i>I don't give a crap 'bout whales
so go and hug a tree</i>

71
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,585
I heard you're looking for people
who care about the slaughter of whales!

72
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,879
{\*Butters, }You wanna help?

73
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,505
No. I got stuff to do.

74
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,383
But I wanted to tell you,
there's these fellers on TV.

75
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,427
They go out in the ocean{\* and try }
to stop the Japanese wherever they are!

76
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,555
Really?
People who are doing something?

77
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:52,351
I watch their show all the time.
And they take volunteers!

78
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,562
Then that's where I belong.

79
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,029
We are badass.

80
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:07,992
Any means necessary.

81
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:11,996
We're not protesters.

82
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,456

- We gotta do something!
- Pull up next to them. The fight is on!

Sweet!

89

00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,574
- Yeah! Let's do it!
- Are we badasses?

00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:00,837
Wait. I know!

95
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:04,465
How about we go on their ship
and then beat ourselves up!

96
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,759
And then we can tell the media
they did it!

97
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,929
- Great idea, captain!
- I'll start right now!

98
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,766
Oh, my God.
Luke's been hurt trying to save whales!

99
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,227
Wait!
I've got a better idea!

100
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:18,438
How about I pretend to be shot!

101
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,732
Then we can tell the media
the Japanese shot me

102
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,900
and it'll start
a international crisis!

103
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,278
Wait.
We don't wanna {\*just }lie about stuff.

104

Why not?

105
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:30,366
Because then we're just douche bags.

You know what?
He's right!

107
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,620

Here, throw one!

They don't care if they stink!

Let's break their boat!

115
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:57,935
No, that'd be illegal.

I'm a pirate in a war!

Pirates don't worry about the law.
You guys said you were badasses!

We are! People think
our methods are extreme,

120
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:14,243
but we'll keep making their boat stink
as long as they're whaling!

121

The Japanese are scared
of how hardcore we are!

who took over

00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,243
and turned it into a big hit.

140

Please welcome,
Stan Marsh and his crew.

141
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,457
Hey, Jordon!
I'm on Larry King, mate!

142
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,834
So, Stan, what motivated you,

143
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,711
what inspired you

144
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:31,464
to get out there
and make a hit TV show?

145
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:34,216
No, I don't care about the TV show.

146
00:10:34,341 --> 00:10:36,635
I'm {\*just }trying to stop
the killing of dolphins and whales.

147
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,764
Once you became captain
the methods used to stop the Japanese

148
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,849
definitely became more aggressive.

149
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,518
Was that the key to helping
boost your ratings?

150
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:48,773
- I don't care about the show.
- We're pirates!

151
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:52,651
I want people to know that you can stop
the Japanese if you got some real balls.

152
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,403
I've got balls!

153
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:58,032
Well, there are many people who see
what you're doing as a positive thing,

154
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,909
and of course
many that see problems with it.

155
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,120
Joining us now
is one of those people...

156
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,289
You say Stan's methods
are unethical.

157
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:09,251
Larry, you can't just go out and take
matters into your own hands like this.

158
00:11:09,376 --> 00:11:12,338
If you want a hit TV show
you have to go through producers,

159
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,632
directors,
people that are in the unions.

160
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:17,385
But, Sid, you saw the show
before Stan took it over.

161
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,680
You have to admit that it was nothing
but incompetent vegan pussies

162
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,265
doing absolutely nothing
and trying to turn it into drama.

163
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:26,435
Yes, but it doesn't justify
changing the entire show structure

164
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,603
that their old captain had pitched
to the network.

165
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:31,064
Could we please talk
about the whaling problem{\* for a second}?

166
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,774
But their old captain,

167
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:36,696
Paul Watson, was an unorganized,
incompetent media whore

168
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:40,741
who thought lying {\*to everyone }was okay
as long as it served his cause.

169
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:44,537
Yes, of course everyone knows
that Paul Watson was a smug,

narcoleptic liar
with no credibility, but...

171
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,999

I gotta get back to work.

Would you mind stepping back{\* a little}?

176
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:05,849
Captain, some {\*new }volunteers showed up
to help us in our crusade.

177
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:08,268
No, dude, we really can't take
any more volunteers.

178
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,979
But they say you know them.

179
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,357
Alright, dude.
This is pretty sweet.

180
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,237
- What?
- {\*What, so }Now that I have a hit TV show

181
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:20,030
you {\*guys }care about dolphins and whales?

182
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:21,365
We always have.

183
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:25,577
- I asked for your help{\*you to help me} and you said no.
- That's not what we said.

184
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:26,996
You said,

"Me and Kenny don't give two shits
about stupid ass whales."

We were talking
about Wales the country.

If you admit that you are doing this
because you want to be on TV,

188

190
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,473

200

- We just got rammed.

This is Hiroshima.

273
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,986
Over 50 years ago,

274
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:36,740
this entire city was destroyed
by nuclear bomb.

275
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,700
We built this museum

276
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,912
so that we never forget
what happened.

277
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,832
What?
Dude...

278
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,752
At 8:15 AM,

279
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:52,506
the people of Hiroshima
were just minding their own business,

280
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:56,259
when out of nowhere,
a flash devastated them all.

281
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,096
Women, children,
who died in the flash

282
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,764
simply evaporated.

283
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:02,766
Those left alive,

284
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:05,143
suffered the worst pain of all.

285
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,854
Burns, radiation poisoning.

286
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:11,316
For generations
the radiation affected the victims.

287
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,027
Japanese babies born without limbs.

288
00:19:14,152 --> 00:19:15,570
Without eyes!

289
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:20,909
Sorry.

290
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,786
Little gassy.
Excuse me.

291
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,539
140,000 Japanese

292
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,541
were kill by atom bomb.

293
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,669
We have never recovered
from the memory of that day.

294
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,255
It is impossible

295
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,633
for a nation
to ever forgive an act so horrible.

296
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:40,262
This picture shows the plane
that dropped the bomb.

297
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:43,306
It was called the <i>Enola Gay</i>.

298
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:47,560
And it was flown by the monsters
who dropped the bomb that day.

299
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:50,647
Dolphin, and whale!

300
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,282
- Where did you get that picture?
- The Americans were nice enough

301
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:03,076
to give it to us
the day after the bombing.

302
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:05,162
We were so thankful for the picture,

303
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:08,039
that the next day
we ended our war with America.

304
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,125
We will never forgive.

305
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,086
Never rest
until they are all wiped out.

306
00:20:13,628 --> 00:20:14,629
Fuck you.

307
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,090
Fuck you, dolphin and whale!

308
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:19,259
{\*So }That's what this has all been about.

309
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:22,304
{\*Dude, }It {\*actually }wasn't a dolphin
and a whale who bombed Hiroshima,

310
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,430
it was the...

311
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:27,017
{\*Dude, }They won't rest until whoever
is responsible is completely wiped out.

312
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,143
{\Oh, }Right.

313
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,021
Look, I think
I can make everything OK here.

314
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,397
Can I just use a phone?

315
00:20:37,652 --> 00:20:39,363
{\*Dude, }Are you sitting at your computer?

316
00:20:39,946 --> 00:20:41,698
I need you to do something for me.

317
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,701
Mr. Prime Minister,
Japanese officials...

318
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,536
You need to know something.{\*There's something you need to know.}

319
00:20:46,661 --> 00:20:49,038
The photo you were given
of the <i>Enola Gay</i> was doctored.

320
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,376
Because the real bombers
feared retaliation so badly

321
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,795
that they simply pointed the finger
at somebody else.

322
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,547
My government has authorized me
to give you the original photo,

323
00:20:57,672 --> 00:20:59,716
unaltered,
so you can finally know the truth.

324
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,719
Dolphins and whales
were just framed by the real bombers.

325
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,473
A chicken and cow.

326
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,602
Chicken and cow?

327
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,438
Chicken and cow?

328
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:17,775
Chicken and cow used poor dolphin
and whale as scapegoat?

329
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,485
This is outrage!

330
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,157
Fuck you, cow!

331
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,082
Fuck you, chicken!

332
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,714
Great job, son.

333
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,299
Now the Japanese are normal,
like us.
