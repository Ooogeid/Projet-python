<i>Episode 11x06
"D-Yikes!"</i>

10
00:00:36,707 --> 00:00:39,960
Everyone, sit down and shut the fuck up!

11
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:44,886
Goddamnit! Stupid ass man!
They're all the same!

12
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:46,275
Oh God, here we go again.

13
00:00:46,316 --> 00:00:51,467
All men care about is sex! I spent two
hours getting ready for that stupid date!

14
00:00:51,499 --> 00:00:54,162
And when the bastard checks out
my body, he just says:

15
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:56,283
"Hey, did you used to be a guy or something?"

16
00:00:56,326 --> 00:00:59,182
I'm a woman now, so what's it matter?!

17
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:00,643
Uh oh, this isn't good.

18
00:01:00,675 --> 00:01:04,210
Did I say something to you, sugartits?!
- No ma'am.

19
00:01:04,248 --> 00:01:05,861
You boys make me sick!

20
00:01:05,908 --> 00:01:10,332
You're well on your way to being men,
who only think with their penises!

21
00:01:10,366 --> 00:01:13,002
I am assigning you all weekend homework!

22
00:01:13,047 --> 00:01:17,773
You are going to read Hemmingway's book,
"The Old Mand And The Sea!"

23
00:01:17,805 --> 00:01:19,091
Have you lost your mind?

24
00:01:19,127 --> 00:01:21,340
Dude, we can't read an entire book
in one weekend.

25
00:01:21,366 --> 00:01:23,593
Oh, that's too bad, dude.

26
00:01:23,627 --> 00:01:28,461
Maybe if you boys could keep your penises in
your pants once in a while you'd get more done!

27
00:01:28,498 --> 00:01:30,752
But teacher, my penis never slips out
of my pants.

28
00:01:30,755 --> 00:01:33,083
Except sometimes when I'm wearing pajamas.

29
00:01:33,117 --> 00:01:38,471
If you do not have an essay written on
Monday, then you will fail! Is that clear?!

30
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:43,913
Dude, how are supposed to read an entire
book over the weekend and write an essay?

31
00:01:43,946 --> 00:01:47,012
Our whole weekend is shot.
- What the hell are we going to do?!

32
00:01:47,047 --> 00:01:51,741
You guys, you guys, relax. We don't have
to read the book or write the essay.

33
00:01:51,777 --> 00:01:53,461
We don't?
- No.

34
00:01:53,495 --> 00:01:56,833
There's people you can hire to do
these sorts of things.

35
00:02:01,315 --> 00:02:03,610
Que paso? Que paso?

36
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:05,283
Looking for work? Sí? Trabajo?

37
00:02:05,318 --> 00:02:07,262
Yes.
- We looking work, sí.

38
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:11,631
Okay, listen up, Mexicans. We need you
to read "The Old Mand And The Sea" for us.

39
00:02:11,668 --> 00:02:14,852
Comprende? "The Old Mand Y La Mer.

40
00:02:15,437 --> 00:02:16,931
Okay.

41
00:02:16,957 --> 00:02:21,433
Here. We need you to work together, read
the book and write four essays, comprende?

42
00:02:21,467 --> 00:02:23,141
La samaraisia.

43
00:02:23,175 --> 00:02:25,633
Okay no problem. That's no problem.
- Yeah, we can do that.

44
00:02:25,636 --> 00:02:26,781
Sí, la samuraisia

45
00:02:26,828 --> 00:02:29,102
Okay, gracias.
- Gracias.

46
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,323
Dude, that is awesome.
I had no idea you could do that.

47
00:02:31,356 --> 00:02:34,101
Oh yeah, dude. Having Mexicans
around totally kicks fucking ass.

48
00:02:34,497 --> 00:02:36,300
<i>"Curves"
For Women</i>

49
00:02:37,108 --> 00:02:40,710
They can all rot in hell!
Who needs men anyway?!

50
00:02:40,747 --> 00:02:44,701
They're Goddamned arrogant
self-centered assholes is what they are!

51
00:02:44,745 --> 00:02:47,870
Are you okay, hon?
- I just hate men is all.

52
00:02:47,895 --> 00:02:50,661
It's like all they care about is how
hot you look!

53
00:02:50,697 --> 00:02:53,860
Yeah, I've never been into men.
That's why I work out here.

54
00:02:53,895 --> 00:02:57,192
Since it's women only we don't get oogled at
or feel self-conscious.

55
00:02:57,225 --> 00:03:00,322
Tell me about it!
I can't even stretch at a normal gym

56
00:03:00,325 --> 00:03:03,453
without some guy trying to stare down my vage.

57
00:03:03,485 --> 00:03:06,372
I'm Allyson.
- Oh, I'm Janet.

58
00:03:06,407 --> 00:03:09,412
Janet Garrison. Sorry I'm so pissed off.

59
00:03:09,448 --> 00:03:12,480
No, I like it.
You seem like a very strong woman.

60
00:03:12,517 --> 00:03:14,101
Yeah, I've been told that.

61
00:03:14,135 --> 00:03:16,451
How come I've never seen you down
at the girl bar?

62
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:19,413
Girl bar? I never even knew there
was such a place.

63
00:03:19,456 --> 00:03:20,443
Oh you'd love it.

64
00:03:20,457 --> 00:03:24,210
It's the only bar in town where women
like us can hang out and be ourselves.

65
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:26,383
It's called "Lebow."

66
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:34,521
Hi Linda, hi Kate.
- Hey Allyson.

67
00:03:34,556 --> 00:03:38,541
Who's the new girl?
- Allyson always goes for the butch ones.

68
00:03:38,578 --> 00:03:40,893
Hey Nell. What's up, Tracy?

69
00:03:40,938 --> 00:03:44,912
What a great place. All the girls
here seem to know each other.

70
00:03:44,947 --> 00:03:47,963
Yeah. Well, most of the girls here
have done each other.

71
00:03:47,986 --> 00:03:52,793
He-yeah. Done what?
- You know. Had sex.

72
00:03:55,265 --> 00:04:00,812
Oh my God, this is a lesbian bar?
- Yeah. I thought you understood that.

73
00:04:00,847 --> 00:04:02,872
Oh jeez.

74
00:04:02,906 --> 00:04:06,093
I'm sorry. I thought you knew what
"girl bar" meant.

75
00:04:06,127 --> 00:04:07,972
But I'm not a-

76
00:04:11,028 --> 00:04:12,432
Janet, I'm really sorry.

77
00:04:12,455 --> 00:04:16,021
It's just that at the gym you said you didn't
like being with men, so I thought you were a-

78
00:04:16,027 --> 00:04:19,901
I don't like being with men!
They're perverted selfish pigs!

79
00:04:21,016 --> 00:04:26,880
Have you never even thought of being
with another woman?

80
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:31,491
Oh goodness no! Of course I haven't.

81
00:04:31,785 --> 00:04:37,452
I mean really I don't even understand
how two women can make love.

82
00:04:37,496 --> 00:04:40,960
I mean unless they just kinda
scissor or something.

83
00:04:40,998 --> 00:04:43,920
There are a lot of ways to make love, Janet.

84
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:48,981
I guess I'd be lying if I said
I wasn't a little tittielated.

85
00:04:49,767 --> 00:04:52,643
Could I maybe kiss you?

86
00:04:54,048 --> 00:04:58,200
Oh, this is wrong! You're another woman,
it doesn't make sense!

87
00:04:58,235 --> 00:05:01,980
Is it wrong, Janet? Let your inhibitions go.

88
00:05:02,018 --> 00:05:06,413
Let's just have fun tonight.
No commitments. Just fun.

89
00:05:18,577 --> 00:05:22,121
Oh yeah, scissor!
Yeah, scissor me Allyson!

90
00:05:22,157 --> 00:05:26,030
Janet, you're crazy!
- Oh, this is hot scissoring!

91
00:05:26,065 --> 00:05:29,191
Oh! Scissor me timbers!

92
00:05:33,185 --> 00:05:36,482
They'd better be done with the book reports!
School starts in 15 minutes!

93
00:05:36,516 --> 00:05:38,413
They'll be done.

94
00:05:38,757 --> 00:05:40,873
Que paso? Que paso?

95
00:05:40,996 --> 00:05:43,343
All right, did you read the book?
- Sí, sí.

96
00:05:43,347 --> 00:05:45,843
What was it about?
In case our teacher asks us.

97
00:05:45,876 --> 00:05:51,931
It starts there the old man
and his job is to catch the fish...

98
00:05:52,098 --> 00:05:55,972
so he get in the boat,
to try and catch fish.

99
00:05:56,098 --> 00:05:59,602
So he catch the fish,
but the fish is very strong...

100
00:05:59,636 --> 00:06:02,680
so the old man, cannot reel in the fish.

101
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:09,241
So then he fight the fish. Some more.
And he finally catch the fish.

102
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:11,702
He catches the fish so,
then he can make money.

103
00:06:11,737 --> 00:06:16,981
No, because on the way home,
the sharks come and eat the fish.

104
00:06:17,017 --> 00:06:20,390
And so, he no make money.

105
00:06:22,547 --> 00:06:25,532
That's it, that's the whole story?
- Sí.

106
00:06:25,566 --> 00:06:28,961
All right, did you write the four essays?
- Sí, we all wrote essays for you.

107
00:06:28,998 --> 00:06:30,132
All right!

108
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:33,490
Okay, let's have 'em.
- Have what?

109
00:06:33,545 --> 00:06:36,890
You said you all wrote essays.

110
00:06:36,928 --> 00:06:39,302
Well, my ese lives in Miami.

111
00:06:39,337 --> 00:06:42,741
I wrote to him like you said,
but I don't think he got the letter yet.

112
00:06:42,776 --> 00:06:44,593
I wrote my ese in Albuquerque.

113
00:06:44,628 --> 00:06:49,052
I wrote three eses:
my ese back home, my ese in Denver

114
00:06:49,056 --> 00:06:53,802
and my ese in Glenwood even wrote me back.
"Thanks for writing me, ese."

115
00:06:56,067 --> 00:06:58,540
Dude, we're totally fucked now!

116
00:06:58,578 --> 00:07:00,602
Why the hell would we pay you
to write your friends?!

117
00:07:00,637 --> 00:07:02,383
We thought it was kind of strange.

118
00:07:02,425 --> 00:07:04,903
This is your fault, Cartman!
Now we're gonna fail!

119
00:07:04,936 --> 00:07:08,091
You guys, school starts in ten minutes!
- Son of a bitch!

120
00:07:11,518 --> 00:07:15,033
Clyde? Clyde! Heyhey Clyde!
You didn't finish your essay either, right?

121
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:17,050
No, I got it done.

122
00:07:17,088 --> 00:07:18,930
Jimmy, did you finish your book report?

123
00:07:18,967 --> 00:07:21,472
Yeah. I feel pretty good about it.
I finished my whole book report.

124
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:25,371
And I got a really nice letter from
my ese who works down at the U-Haul.

125
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:29,820
Crap!
- We're dead.

126
00:07:29,855 --> 00:07:35,301
Hello, class. Here's my little desk,
my nice lil chalkboard.

127
00:07:35,418 --> 00:07:37,101
Mrs. Garrison, about our book reports.

128
00:07:37,138 --> 00:07:42,160
Oh, that's okay Eric. If you need a little
more time with your homework, just say so.

129
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:43,980
Really?

130
00:07:44,017 --> 00:07:48,121
Kids, I need to tell you something that
you might find shocking.

131
00:07:49,318 --> 00:07:51,531
I'm gay.

132
00:07:52,266 --> 00:07:53,342
Again?

133
00:07:53,378 --> 00:07:57,741
It was a shock to me too.
I met another woman and...

134
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:02,663
we went to this fabulous bar called "Les Bos"
where I finally felt at home.

135
00:08:02,696 --> 00:08:06,221
Allyson and I talked and really opened
up to each other...

136
00:08:06,258 --> 00:08:09,140
and then we scissored all night long.

137
00:08:09,517 --> 00:08:11,913
You have to be careful with scissors.

138
00:08:11,956 --> 00:08:15,801
But listen, I am not going to just rush
into a relationship with Allyson.

139
00:08:15,836 --> 00:08:20,191
I'm a late-in-life lesbian. So I need
to play the field for a while, right?

140
00:08:20,225 --> 00:08:21,990
Oh I'm so happy.

141
00:08:22,047 --> 00:08:25,970
That's great!
- Let's hear it for teacher being a lesbian!

142
00:08:30,707 --> 00:08:34,142
Hey Tracy, hey Kate.
- Hi Janet.

143
00:08:34,226 --> 00:08:38,740
Looking hot, Linda. Wanna go somewhere
and scissor later on?

144
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:41,836
Hey Patty.
- What's up, Janet.

145
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:46,955
Oh, stop giving me that look.
Scissoring me with your eyes.

146
00:08:46,986 --> 00:08:50,737
Hey Janet, why don't you pick up
on your own girl?

147
00:08:55,029 --> 00:08:57,231
Oh yeah, dyke fight!

148
00:09:03,098 --> 00:09:05,390
You kicked me right in the pussy!

149
00:09:10,648 --> 00:09:14,262
Oh, we're scissoring. Oh yeah, scissor!

150
00:09:14,665 --> 00:09:18,442
You guys. You guys, stop it.
Listen to me, everybody.

151
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,943
I got some bad news.
- What is it, Katie?

152
00:09:22,365 --> 00:09:25,961
They're closing down the bar. For good!

153
00:09:26,977 --> 00:09:29,920
Closing it down? They can't do that.

154
00:09:29,967 --> 00:09:34,110
This is our home.
- Yeah, this is our home.

155
00:09:34,158 --> 00:09:39,302
Well it's true, I just talked to the owners.
hey've sold the bar to Persians.

156
00:09:40,365 --> 00:09:43,883
Persians?!
- So where are we supposed to go?

157
00:09:43,938 --> 00:09:47,392
We aren't going anywhere!
We have a history here!

158
00:09:47,426 --> 00:09:52,170
Persians are closing this bar over
my dead lesbian body!

159
00:09:55,488 --> 00:10:01,091
Mayor, this is an outrage! We are being
discriminated against as lesbians!

160
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:06,813
You're a lesbian now?
- That's right. A proud lesbian!

161
00:10:06,846 --> 00:10:09,142
And our home is being taken away!

162
00:10:09,177 --> 00:10:13,310
The bar has been sold to Persian club owners.
I don't know what you want me to do about it.

163
00:10:13,348 --> 00:10:17,050
Forbid the transaction! This is happening
all over the country, Mayor.

164
00:10:17,085 --> 00:10:20,503
Lesbian bars being bought out,
shut down, it isn't right!

165
00:10:20,525 --> 00:10:21,880
Yeah, that's right!

166
00:10:21,918 --> 00:10:23,791
I'm sorry, but my hands are tied.

167
00:10:23,825 --> 00:10:28,113
The new owners plan to start redecorating
the bar tomorrow. You have to be out by then.

168
00:10:29,576 --> 00:10:32,510
Have you seen how Persians decorate?

169
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:38,223
They will cover that bar in cheesy
blue carpeting, white statues

170
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:41,923
and gold curtain rods to the point
that you will want to puke!

171
00:10:44,127 --> 00:10:46,743
Mrs. Garrison, get out of here.

172
00:10:48,388 --> 00:10:52,143
Well, here's to some great times at this place.

173
00:10:52,177 --> 00:10:56,231
Yeah. Guess we'll just have to find
somewhere else to hang out.

174
00:10:56,816 --> 00:11:01,652
Now, come on gals! I can't believe
what I'm hearing! We can't just give up!

175
00:11:01,686 --> 00:11:04,960
Well, what are we supposed to do, Janet?
- We stand and fight!

176
00:11:05,005 --> 00:11:09,423
When the Persians come we tell them
"We aren't leaving Les Bos."

177
00:11:09,457 --> 00:11:14,532
Actually, it's "Lebow."
- No, it's Les Bos!

178
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:20,720
We are Lesbos! And as Lesbos,
we cannot just stand and watch

179
00:11:20,745 --> 00:11:24,210
as one girl bar after another gets shut down!

180
00:11:24,765 --> 00:11:28,113
The Persians have sent somebody to talk to us.

181
00:11:29,058 --> 00:11:30,890
Hello, my name is Emir Hadi.

182
00:11:30,907 --> 00:11:34,111
My boss sent me over here because
he heard that you were upset

183
00:11:34,117 --> 00:11:36,813
about us trying to take over the bar.

184
00:11:36,845 --> 00:11:38,143
Yes, we are.

185
00:11:38,175 --> 00:11:42,562
Well, we want to assure you that when
this place becomes another Club Persh

186
00:11:42,565 --> 00:11:46,092
you will all still be 100% welcome.

187
00:11:46,128 --> 00:11:48,922
All they want is to make the place really nice.

188
00:11:48,957 --> 00:11:53,542
We're going to put down some lovely
blue carpet and gold curtain rods.

189
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:55,622
I knew it! I knew it!

190
00:11:55,655 --> 00:11:57,213
But you are still welcome to come.

191
00:11:57,215 --> 00:12:01,551
My boss wants you to know that you will
not be discriminated against in any way.

192
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:06,182
Would you allow straight people in? Men?
- Well we would allow whoever-

193
00:12:06,197 --> 00:12:10,112
Choose your next words wisely, Persian!

194
00:12:10,585 --> 00:12:15,070
Look, we don't have to offer you anything,
so I don't know why you're being so difficult.

195
00:12:15,076 --> 00:12:16,403
This is crazy.

196
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:19,372
No, this isn't crazy.

197
00:12:20,488 --> 00:12:24,012
This is Les Bos!

198
00:12:28,767 --> 00:12:30,681
How dare you!

199
00:12:33,006 --> 00:12:35,020
<i>And so it had begun.</i>

200
00:12:35,056 --> 00:12:40,673
<i>By kicking the Persian messenger in
the balls, the lesbos had sent a message.</i>

201
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:44,553
<i>All over the country lesbians heard
of the brave standoff.</i>

202
00:12:44,585 --> 00:12:50,581
<i>As a group of lesbians in Colorado are refusing
to allow the new owners of their bar in.</i>

203
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:53,240
Good for them!
- You go girls!

204
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:03,150
<i>The Persians returned to their office</i>

205
00:13:03,186 --> 00:13:08,123
<i>and told their coworkers how the
thirty lesbos were refusing to let them in.</i>

206
00:13:08,168 --> 00:13:13,630
Well fine. If they're going to block the
entrance, we'll just bring like, sixty of us!

207
00:13:13,677 --> 00:13:15,893
I'll call more Persians for help.

208
00:13:26,415 --> 00:13:28,553
<i>The hours pass quickly...</i>

209
00:13:28,597 --> 00:13:34,312
<i>and the lesbians boldly stood out in front of
their bar to stop the Persians from entering.</i>

210
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:36,310
Here they come.

211
00:13:46,518 --> 00:13:48,722
There's so many of them.

212
00:13:49,775 --> 00:13:52,683
Lesbos! Positions!

213
00:13:55,656 --> 00:14:00,213
Lesbians! Stand aside.
We're coming in to redecorate it!

214
00:14:00,248 --> 00:14:01,893
The hell you are!

215
00:14:01,906 --> 00:14:06,853
You can take your blue carpet and gold curtain
rods and shove them up your Persian buttholes!

216
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:10,232
All right! Come on!
They can't stop all of us!

217
00:14:16,947 --> 00:14:21,250
Lesbos! Remember this day!
Remember this fight!

218
00:14:30,808 --> 00:14:32,851
Don't give them an inch!

219
00:14:37,805 --> 00:14:39,701
Iranian faggot!

220
00:14:40,278 --> 00:14:44,372
Come on, seriously, let us in!
- Never!

221
00:14:46,525 --> 00:14:50,042
<i>For hours, the Lesbos kept the Persians back</i>

222
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:54,562
<i>holding them off,
keeping them from decorating.</i>

223
00:14:55,508 --> 00:14:57,981
<i>Finally the Persians grew tired.</i>

224
00:14:58,016 --> 00:15:02,171
<i>And many of them wanted to go shopping
for more designer sunglasses.</i>

225
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:07,211
<i>They retreated. The Lesbos had held.</i>

226
00:15:09,246 --> 00:15:12,260
Lesbos!

227
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:20,073
<i>The Persians who did not go shopping
now knew they must face their boss.</i>

228
00:15:20,107 --> 00:15:21,983
Here he comes.

229
00:15:26,488 --> 00:15:33,072
<i>Rauf Xerxes. He sat atop a gold Hummer
with customized Gucci accessories</i>

230
00:15:33,075 --> 00:15:35,950
<i>which only a Persian would think was cool.</i>

231
00:15:39,418 --> 00:15:45,501
Mr. Xerxes, the Lesbos wouldn't move.
We could not get inside to redecorate.

232
00:15:46,568 --> 00:15:50,541
Tumon, how could you have failed me
in this simple task?

233
00:15:50,598 --> 00:15:55,662
I am so seriously pissed off right now.
I could bust a testicle.

234
00:15:55,726 --> 00:16:00,151
<i>And with that the Persian club owner
came to a realization.</i>

235
00:16:00,716 --> 00:16:05,141
I shall have to deal with these lesbos myself.

236
00:16:09,085 --> 00:16:12,832
Girls, I just want to say that I am
very proud of you.

237
00:16:12,867 --> 00:16:17,450
The way we kept those Persians from
taking over our bar was Les-tastic.

238
00:16:17,487 --> 00:16:19,401
Well that's great, Janet, but what now?

239
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:21,970
We can't just stay here pushing them
away our whole lives.

240
00:16:22,007 --> 00:16:25,662
We can't? I think it's pretty fun.
- We have to have a more solid plan.

241
00:16:25,696 --> 00:16:28,761
Something we can use against them permanently.

242
00:16:28,796 --> 00:16:31,953
Maybe we can dig up some dirt
on the club owner.

243
00:16:31,987 --> 00:16:36,780
Hey, that's a great idea, Betsy.
We need somebody working on the inside.

244
00:16:36,818 --> 00:16:37,773
Whattaya mean?

245
00:16:37,806 --> 00:16:40,041
If we could get some Persians on our side

246
00:16:40,047 --> 00:16:42,803
we could send them in to try to dig up
some dirt on the owner!

247
00:16:42,838 --> 00:16:45,993
But who's gonna spy on them for us?
We don't know any Persians.

248
00:16:46,028 --> 00:16:50,753
It's okay. There's people you can hire
for this kind of thing.

249
00:16:53,757 --> 00:16:56,443
Que paso? Que paso?

250
00:16:56,496 --> 00:16:58,603
Looking for work? Sí? Trabajo?

251
00:16:58,637 --> 00:17:00,802
Yes.
- We looking work, sí.

252
00:17:00,835 --> 00:17:04,531
All right. We need you to infiltrate
some Persians who run Club Persh.

253
00:17:04,537 --> 00:17:06,700
And dig up some dirt on the owner.

254
00:17:07,695 --> 00:17:09,310
Okay.
- Sure.

255
00:17:09,346 --> 00:17:11,613
Janet, how is this gonna work?
They don't look Persian.

256
00:17:11,648 --> 00:17:13,583
Sure they do.

257
00:17:13,685 --> 00:17:16,623
Just have to gel the hair...

258
00:17:17,068 --> 00:17:21,171
put on a silk shirt, some gold chains...

259
00:17:21,486 --> 00:17:23,610
and tons of cologne.

260
00:17:24,348 --> 00:17:26,000
Persian.

261
00:17:26,235 --> 00:17:27,583
Sí.

262
00:17:28,707 --> 00:17:32,113
All right, Mexicans, take the rest of these
outfits and see what you can find out.

263
00:17:32,115 --> 00:17:33,503
The address is in there too.

264
00:17:33,538 --> 00:17:36,173
Okay.
- No problem.

265
00:17:36,595 --> 00:17:41,120
And Mexicans, please hurry.
Our girl bar has very littlel time.

266
00:17:42,365 --> 00:17:48,590
<i>A full day passed and the Lesbos knew
a second Persian attack was imminent.</i>

267
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:54,652
<i>Outside, Lesbo lookouts kept watch,
ready to alert the others.</i>

268
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:58,333
<i>The Lesbo leader sat nervously inside.</i>

269
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:03,813
<i>Her plan to dress Mexicans as Persians
to act as spies, perhaps it had failed.</i>

270
00:18:03,848 --> 00:18:08,590
<i>She looked around at her fellow Lesbos.
They were tired.</i>

271
00:18:08,627 --> 00:18:12,920
<i>In order to keep her Lesobs awake,
she had no choice:</i>

272
00:18:12,956 --> 00:18:15,891
<i>She would have to make coffee.</i>

273
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:40,742
<i>With fresh coffee brewed, the Lesbos
found new life, but would it be enough?</i>

274
00:18:41,157 --> 00:18:43,683
The Persians are attacking again!

275
00:18:43,736 --> 00:18:47,332
Take positions, Lesbos!
- Get outside!

276
00:18:47,365 --> 00:18:50,942
No wait, wait! That's not the Persians,
it's the Mexicans.

277
00:18:50,995 --> 00:18:52,933
Really?
- How can you tell?

278
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,022
Let them through. It's okay.

279
00:18:55,056 --> 00:18:56,941
Hola, como estas?
- Hola.

280
00:18:56,978 --> 00:19:00,451
Did you uncover anything?
Are the Persians doing anything illegal?

281
00:19:01,205 --> 00:19:04,363
No. They're not doing anything illegal.

282
00:19:04,406 --> 00:19:05,452
Are you sure?

283
00:19:05,486 --> 00:19:09,452
No, but we did find out a kind of secret
about the Persian in charge.

284
00:19:09,487 --> 00:19:10,940
What secret?!

285
00:19:13,337 --> 00:19:16,102
Oh my God, are, are you sure about this?
- Sí.

286
00:19:16,135 --> 00:19:21,391
Janet! Janet, the Persian boss is here.
He wants to talk to you and you alone.

287
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:26,361
It's okay. It's time I met this rich
Persian asshole face to face.

288
00:19:31,685 --> 00:19:35,311
Why are you lesbians being so difficult?

289
00:19:35,347 --> 00:19:38,292
Because we're protecting the only home we have.

290
00:19:38,327 --> 00:19:41,493
I don't know why you have to be
all superlame about this.

291
00:19:41,525 --> 00:19:44,982
You know, a long time ago when
I first realized I was a lesbian.

292
00:19:44,986 --> 00:19:47,221
I felt isolated, confused.

293
00:19:47,258 --> 00:19:50,820
And finally I found a place that accepts
me for who I am.

294
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:53,111
Okay, how about this?

295
00:19:53,148 --> 00:19:58,313
I will make you the manager of Club Persh.
You'll make good money.

296
00:19:58,348 --> 00:20:03,421
That's a generous offers, Xerxes, but you
see, there's something I know about you.

297
00:20:04,596 --> 00:20:07,883
I know you're actually a woman.

298
00:20:08,648 --> 00:20:10,422
How...?

299
00:20:10,507 --> 00:20:12,453
How did you find that out?

300
00:20:12,485 --> 00:20:17,811
I hired Mexicans to spy on you!
They saw you working out at Curves.

301
00:20:17,866 --> 00:20:22,320
You don't understand. Women can't be
the boss in Persian culture.

302
00:20:22,356 --> 00:20:24,600
Nobody can know about this.

303
00:20:24,648 --> 00:20:28,850
Yeah. And you know why?
Because men are all assholes!

304
00:20:28,887 --> 00:20:34,260
They make you feel ashamed for being
a little big or manly looking.

305
00:20:34,295 --> 00:20:39,590
But not Lesbos. We accept other women
for who they are inside!

306
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:41,573
You do? Seriously?

307
00:20:41,617 --> 00:20:46,153
Have you never even thought of being
with another woman before?

308
00:20:46,188 --> 00:20:51,503
No. I don't even know how two women
can make love.

309
00:20:51,536 --> 00:20:56,060
Unless they just kind of scissor or something.

310
00:20:58,827 --> 00:21:03,082
Oh yeah! Scissor me, Xerxes!
- Oh, that feels so supercool!

311
00:21:03,088 --> 00:21:06,491
Yeah, scissor!
- Oh, I'm a new woman!

312
00:21:06,978 --> 00:21:10,460
<i>And so it was that Les Bos was saved.</i>

313
00:21:10,496 --> 00:21:13,840
<i>The Persians had agreed to leave
it a lesbian bar</i>

314
00:21:13,876 --> 00:21:16,952
<i>for no dyke should be without cocktails.</i>

315
00:21:16,988 --> 00:21:21,662
Thanks for everything, Xerxes.
- No. Thank you, friend.

316
00:21:21,696 --> 00:21:24,150
Hey, aren't you supposed to be teaching
school right now?

317
00:21:24,187 --> 00:21:27,063
The school hired a substitute to cover for me.

318
00:21:28,028 --> 00:21:31,561
And so to find the sum of the two fractions

319
00:21:31,575 --> 00:21:35,221
you must always check for the lowest
common denominator.

320
00:21:35,258 --> 00:21:37,880
Sí.
- Sí. Sí. Yes. Yes. That's right.

321
00:21:37,917 --> 00:21:41,490
These guys are pretty good.
- Yeah. I think I'm actually learning something.
