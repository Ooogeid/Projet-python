Season 13 Episode 3
"Margaritaville"

2
00:00:34,414 --> 00:00:35,983
Do I really have to do this, dad?

3
00:00:36,108 --> 00:00:38,057
Now more than ever
you need to understand

4
00:00:38,182 --> 00:00:39,735
the importance of saving money.

5
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,194
But grandma said I could use
this money to buy whatever I want.

6
00:00:42,319 --> 00:00:43,417
OK, next, please.

7
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,140
Go on, Stanley.

8
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,895
- How can I help you, young man?
- I got $100 check from my grandma.

9
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,735
And my dad said I need to put it in
the bank so it can grow over the years.

10
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:57,165
Well, that's fantastic.
A really smart decision, young man.

11
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,315
We can put that check in
a money market mutual fund,

12
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,095
then we'll reinvest the earnings
into foreign currency accounts

13
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,070
with come can pounding
interest and it's gone!

14
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:16,259
- What?
- It's gone. It's all gone.

15
00:01:17,694 --> 00:01:19,619
- What's all gone?
- The money in your account.

16
00:01:19,744 --> 00:01:21,747
It didn't do too well. It's gone.

17
00:01:22,548 --> 00:01:26,298
- What do you mean? I have $100.
- Not anymore, you don't. Poof!

18
00:01:28,113 --> 00:01:29,505
What can I do to get back my...

19
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:32,007
I'm sorry, sir, but this line
is for bank members only.

20
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:33,681
I just opened an account!

21
00:01:33,806 --> 00:01:35,875
Do you have any money
invested with this bank?

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,221
No, you just lost it all.

23
00:01:37,346 --> 00:01:39,858
Then please stand aside for people
who actually have money with us.

24
00:01:39,983 --> 00:01:41,035
Next, please.

25
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,445
Hello, Mrs. Farnickle.
How are you today?

26
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,320
Making a deposit, are we?

27
00:01:46,603 --> 00:01:49,043
Great. We can just put that
into your retirement account

28
00:01:49,168 --> 00:01:51,968
and make it go to work
for you and it's gone.

29
00:01:53,452 --> 00:01:56,288
- What?
- Sorry, That's gone. Please step aside

30
00:01:56,413 --> 00:01:58,935
for people who actually
have money with the bank. Next, please.

31
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,060
Dad!

32
00:02:00,185 --> 00:02:02,545
I'm trying to teach my son
the importance of savings.

33
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,995
- You already lost his money?
- Oh, Mr. Marsh! Don't worry.

34
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,031
We can just transfer money
from your account and into a portfolio

35
00:02:09,156 --> 00:02:11,125
with your son's... and it's gone!

36
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,439
This line is for people
who have money with the bank only.

37
00:02:13,564 --> 00:02:14,989
Please step aside.

38
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,395
<i>This is a 9 News special report.</i>

39
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,017
<i>Recession: a nation in peril.</i>

40
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,444
An economic crisis has hit South Park
and the nation like never before.

41
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:31,650
Another South Park bank closed down,
leaving thousands of people in debt.

42
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,916
It's just crazy, you know?
Everyone's affected by it.

43
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:36,989
It's like all
the money just vanished.

44
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,257
It's really terrifying. We've got
no money to pay our mortgage now.

45
00:02:41,382 --> 00:02:44,330
- We could very easily lose our house.
- Hi, grandma!

46
00:02:44,763 --> 00:02:48,767
First, the money started going and
now everyone's getting laid off work.

47
00:02:48,892 --> 00:02:50,801
They took our jobs!

48
00:02:51,124 --> 00:02:54,520
- They took our jobs!
- Took our jobs!

49
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,985
Just how far will the economy fall?

50
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:02,264
We asked economic reporter
Dan Banks for his assessment.

51
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,566
We'll have the rest of Dan's
interview tonight at 10:00.

52
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,616
All right, everyone, eat up.

53
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,315
Oh, Jesus Christ.

54
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,265
Sliced hot dogs and tomato slices?

55
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,228
You said we had to be
careful with our money.

56
00:03:23,353 --> 00:03:25,265
I've got nothing for a food budget!

57
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,456
Mom, dad, how come there's
suddenly no money?

58
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,785
I'll tell you what happened, son.

59
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,695
There's a bunch of idiot s out there
who weren't happy with what they had.

60
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,024
They wanted a bigger
house and materialistic

61
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:37,805
things that they didn't even need.

62
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,012
People with no money
who got loans to buy

63
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:42,405
frivolous things
they had no business buying.

64
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:45,385
These assholes just blindly
started buying any stupid thing

65
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,311
that looked appealing because
they thought money was endless.

66
00:03:57,339 --> 00:03:58,885
... meaning less money coming in.

67
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,289
And the idiots couldn't see
that by doing all this

68
00:04:01,414 --> 00:04:03,845
frivolous spending they were
mocking the economy.

69
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,870
And they made
the economy very angry.

70
00:04:06,405 --> 00:04:08,186
We're all feeling
the economy's vengeance

71
00:04:08,311 --> 00:04:09,993
because of materialistic heathens

72
00:04:10,118 --> 00:04:13,420
who did stupid things with their money.
Do you understand, son?

73
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,061
Yeah. I think I get it.

74
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,135
And so why is
our economy failing us?

75
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,050
Because the government
kept interest rates

76
00:04:23,175 --> 00:04:24,725
too low for too long!

77
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,224
The government took
our economy for granted

78
00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:29,395
and now we are
all here paying the price!

79
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,495
How long will we sit and watch
our economy fall...

80
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:36,624
And so I say to you, do not listen
to the Wall Street brokers, for they...

81
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,262
are the ones who
put us in this situation!

82
00:04:39,387 --> 00:04:41,214
Fat cats with corporate greed.

83
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:44,962
They are the ones who knowingly
drove us down this pathway of doom.

84
00:04:45,087 --> 00:04:46,545
It must have gone somewhere!

85
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:49,623
The answer is obvious,
my friends. It is the Jews!

86
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:53,295
Covetous Jews, who have taken all our
money and hoarded it for themselves!

87
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,583
Hidden all the cash in some
secret Jew cave that they built,

88
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:59,363
probably back in the early '60s.
It is the Jews...

89
00:04:59,488 --> 00:05:03,395
... people casting all different kinds
of blame from person to person.

90
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,720
But the fault lies in all of you.

91
00:05:05,976 --> 00:05:09,076
You! Who bought that $300,000 house

92
00:05:09,201 --> 00:05:11,715
when you only had
$20,000 to put down. You!

93
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,415
Who bought that third car even though
only two people in your home drive.

94
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,065
It is time to stop pointing fingers.

95
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,780
Finger-pointing
gets us nowhere. Steve!

96
00:05:21,498 --> 00:05:23,751
We have mocked our economy

97
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:27,493
and now the economy has
cast its vengeance upon us all.

98
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,710
He's right.

99
00:05:29,835 --> 00:05:31,914
This is the first guy
to actually make sense.

100
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,235
Yeah, it is an angry
and unforgiving economy.

101
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,855
To repent we must stop
frivolous spending.

102
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:41,005
Instead of paying for cable,
let us watch clouds!

103
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:44,630
Instead of buying clothes,
wear but sheets from thine beds!

104
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:47,659
Cut spending to only
the bare essentials...

105
00:05:47,784 --> 00:05:49,398
Water and bread.

106
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,270
And margaritas, yeah!

107
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,528
Hello, young man. Welcome to
<i>Sur La Table</i>. Can I help you?

108
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:05,280
I wanna return this Margaritaville
my stupid dad bought.

109
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,495
Oh, that's all
we get anymore, returns.

110
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,953
Could you please put
the receipt here on this table?

111
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:20,880
Sorry, our computers are slow today.
We need a new Ethernet cable.

112
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:24,042
I'm sorry, sir. I'd like to give you
a refund, but I'm afraid

113
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:25,445
it's not doable.

114
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,805
- What?
- I said I'm not able, sir.

115
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,472
You see, this Margaritaville
was purchased with a payment plan.

116
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:31,730
So?

117
00:06:31,855 --> 00:06:35,615
Well, an outside financing company
handles those payment plans.

118
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,530
Customers just pay
for some of the machine

119
00:06:37,655 --> 00:06:39,481
and the finance company
pays for the rest.

120
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:42,317
Can't I just return it and get
the money my dad put in back?

121
00:06:43,883 --> 00:06:45,460
That's improbable,

122
00:06:45,753 --> 00:06:48,845
but not impossible.
I'm not really sure how it works.

123
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:51,145
You'll have to speak
with the people at the top.

124
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,997
I can give you the finance company's
address if that's agreeable with you.

125
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:02,090
We have become lovers of pleasure,
rather than lovers of the economy.

126
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,745
There are those who will say
that the economy has forsaken us.

127
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:08,355
Nay! You hath forsaken the economy!

128
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,846
And now you know
the economy's wrath.

129
00:07:11,653 --> 00:07:14,433
Oh, thoust can shop
in a sporting goods store,

130
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,636
but knowest thou that the economy

131
00:07:16,761 --> 00:07:18,812
will take away
thy broncos cap from thy head.

132
00:07:19,631 --> 00:07:21,875
You mocked the economy without fear.

133
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,005
Thine own stockbrokers...
now lie dead by their own hand.

134
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:27,780
And thou knowest that thy
stockbrokers did not fear the economy!

135
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,900
Well, here we are, my friends.

136
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:34,495
You have brought the economy's
vengeance upon yourselves.

137
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,468
- What can we do, Randy?
- Yes, tell us!

138
00:07:38,593 --> 00:07:42,252
- Tell us what to do!
- Tell us, Randy, what we should do!

139
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,735
We must all wear sheets instead of
buying clothes that need detergent.

140
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,491
Instead of cars that take gasoline,

141
00:07:48,616 --> 00:07:51,315
we can get around
on lamas from <i>Drakes Farm</i>.

142
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,951
Instead of video games
that take batteries and software,

143
00:07:54,076 --> 00:07:55,891
our kids will play with squirrels!

144
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,430
We must let the economy know
that we are capable of respecting it.

145
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,740
No more needless spending!

146
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,870
The economy is our shepherd.

147
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,851
We shalt not want!

148
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,630
- Morning, Ted.
- Morning, Al.

149
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,850
Well, this sucks.

150
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,880
Sure was better when
our parents were buying us stuff.

151
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:40,575
Of all the times for people
to decide to stop buying things,

152
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,684
it had to be the week that
<i>GTA4</i> comes out for Nintendo DS!

153
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,515
You want something
new every week, fat ass.

154
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,016
Don't you fraternize me!

155
00:08:50,141 --> 00:08:52,239
- This is all your fault, you know.
- My fault?

156
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,253
The Jews took all
the money away and they...

157
00:08:54,378 --> 00:08:56,649
Don't even start!
Don't even start, Cartman!

158
00:08:56,774 --> 00:08:59,975
Well, why are we wearing bed sheets
and playing with squirrels, Kyle?

159
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,665
Not because of the Jews, Butters!
Who told you that?

160
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,040
Well, Eric did!

161
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,319
Just tell us where
the cave is, Kyle.

162
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:08,730
Now, look!

163
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,185
The reason we're in this situation
is because people are being stupid!

164
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:15,470
The economy isn't some vengeful
being that takes things away from us.

165
00:09:15,834 --> 00:09:17,795
The economy is just
made up of people.

166
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,766
And people have just
lost their faith in it.

167
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,605
What people really should
be doing is spending more.

168
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,080
Spending is fine!

169
00:09:24,827 --> 00:09:26,995
We best speak with the council.

170
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,794
Tell them a young Jew is speaking
heresy towards the economy.

171
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,583
- Can I help you?
- I want to return this Margaritaville.

172
00:09:45,165 --> 00:09:46,835
OK. Let me send you into Josh.

173
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:54,115
Hey, welcome to Big Orange
finance company!

174
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,345
Yeah, have a seat.
You want some Carmex?

175
00:09:56,813 --> 00:09:59,267
No thanks.
I want to return this Margaritaville

176
00:09:59,392 --> 00:10:02,505
and the guy at <i>Sur La Table</i> said
you are the company that financed it.

177
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,809
Oh, yeah. No. You know what?

178
00:10:04,934 --> 00:10:07,189
- No, yeah.
- What?

179
00:10:07,488 --> 00:10:10,833
Yeah, we can't give you
your money back for that. Yeah, no.

180
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:14,208
You'd have to talk to
the people on Wall Street. Yeah.

181
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,760
Wall Street?

182
00:10:15,885 --> 00:10:18,576
Yeah, no, see what
I do is find Americans

183
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,555
who want a frozen beverage
machine but can't afford one.

184
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,373
And I hook them up with investors
who want to get into the Margaritaville

185
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,333
payment plan business, yeah.

186
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,700
So?

187
00:10:27,825 --> 00:10:30,815
So the problem is your Margaritaville
payment plan has been combined,

188
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:34,226
with thousands of others into
one big Margaritaville security.

189
00:10:34,351 --> 00:10:35,820
Yeah, no.

190
00:10:35,945 --> 00:10:38,637
Yeah. No, yeah.

191
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:49,835
The entire town has given over
to your ways, Mr. Chairman.

192
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,075
Everyone has even
stopped using electricity

193
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,069
so as to stop
paying electrical bills.

194
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,697
You've really done
an amazing thing, Mr. Marsh.

195
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,172
People have learned
to hold on to their money

196
00:10:59,297 --> 00:11:02,077
so as to not feel the sting
of the economy's mighty sword.

197
00:11:02,768 --> 00:11:04,468
I am pretty smart, yeah.

198
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,928
But I have assembled
this economic committee

199
00:11:07,053 --> 00:11:09,459
to make sure everyone
sticks to my new plan.

200
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:12,401
We've got guards posted
at the malls to make sure nobody

201
00:11:12,526 --> 00:11:14,595
gets tempted to buy dumb stuff.

202
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,805
And Pat Saltzman
is doing house checks

203
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:19,344
to make sure nobody's
ordering anything stupid online.

204
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:23,223
Then perhaps soon
our economy will return to us.

205
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,559
Council, I bring news of discord!

206
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,931
A young Jew was in the town square

207
00:11:28,056 --> 00:11:30,456
speaking blasphemy
about the economy.

208
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,472
- What?
- He was saying that

209
00:11:32,597 --> 00:11:35,875
your ideas are false
and the economy is not vengeful!

210
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,030
He was rallying
people to spend more!

211
00:11:38,424 --> 00:11:40,949
Spend more? What mockery is this?

212
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,063
Relax, Father Maxi.

213
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,237
What harm can
one Jew do against our...

214
00:11:46,362 --> 00:11:48,212
economic recovery movement?

215
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,560
I had a dream last night.
I was in a field,

216
00:11:55,042 --> 00:11:57,942
and I had <i>GTA: Chinatown Wars</i>
right next to me.

217
00:11:58,705 --> 00:12:00,358
But then the sky went black and...

218
00:12:00,483 --> 00:12:03,233
<i>GTA: Chinatown Wars</i>
just melted in my hands.

219
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:07,670
What's that?

220
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:11,549
Excuse me. We need
to borrow your squirrels!

221
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,857
- What?
- No! No, please!

222
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,355
You have sinned!

223
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,028
- Oh, Jesus, I'm sorry. Please!
- What's going on?

224
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:21,323
Garrison, you have brought your filth
to this town for the last time!

225
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:22,943
What did he do?

226
00:12:23,068 --> 00:12:26,578
Your teacher was buying a kitchen aid
stand mixer at <i>Bed Bath & Beyond</i>.

227
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,497
Take thy punishment, heathen!

228
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,003
Hey, stop it! Stop!

229
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,756
Move aside, kid. He must
pay for his stand mixer.

230
00:12:38,144 --> 00:12:39,549
Come on, this is ridiculous!

231
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,932
What's ridiculous
about hucking squirrels at a man

232
00:12:42,057 --> 00:12:45,115
- who has angered the economy?
- Just have a little compassion, huh?

233
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,849
Everyone's gone out and bought
something stupid. It's not so bad.

234
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,735
Whichever of you guys has never
bought anything frivolous, go ahead

235
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,362
and huck the next squirrel.

236
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,651
Excuse me? Excuse me!

237
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,372
I'd like to return
this Margaritaville, please.

238
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:11,855
Margaritaville?

239
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,600
My dad bought it on a payment plan
that was set up by a finance company,

240
00:13:14,725 --> 00:13:16,925
which got their principal
investors from somebody here.

241
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:19,381
- Oh, that makes sense.
- It does?

242
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,734
You see, son,
we lump thousands of these

243
00:13:21,859 --> 00:13:23,575
Margaritaville
installment plans together

244
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,645
into Margaritaville
based securities,

245
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:29,155
then chopped those securities up in
a way that we could sell them to banks.

246
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,846
So I can return it to a bank?

247
00:13:30,971 --> 00:13:34,525
Nope. Because people like you
are defaulting on their Margaritavilles

248
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:37,675
so the government had to buy the
Margaritaville assets from the banks.

249
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,600
What?

250
00:13:38,725 --> 00:13:40,560
Just talk to the treasury
department. In D.C.

251
00:13:40,685 --> 00:13:43,113
They're the ones who really
understand how all this works.

252
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,330
Oh, sell, sell, sell, sell!

253
00:13:48,138 --> 00:13:50,709
Listen, this is
all you need to know.

254
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:54,215
The economy is not
a supernatural all-knowing entity.

255
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,287
The economy is just an idea

256
00:13:56,412 --> 00:13:58,503
made up by people
thousands of years ago.

257
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,214
The economy is not real.

258
00:14:02,012 --> 00:14:03,691
And yet, it is real.

259
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,405
Nowadays, they'll give credit cards to
practically anyone who applies for them.

260
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,575
I applied for this
yesterday to prove a point.

261
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,558
It is an American Express
platinum card.

262
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,602
It has no spending limit.

263
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,888
Do not be afraid!
This is only plastic.

264
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,395
It's just something
made up by people.

265
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,986
Truly meaningless
until we put our faith in it.

266
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:26,295
Faith is what makes
an economy exist.

267
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,659
Without faith, it is only
plastic cards and paper money.

268
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,205
By all reports, the young Jew
is not letting up.

269
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:38,663
He is still going around
convincing people to have

270
00:14:38,788 --> 00:14:40,420
faith in the economy by shopping.

271
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,758
We've done everything we can
and yet the economy has not improved.

272
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,135
Worse, it has declined.

273
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,710
Poor Bart here just lost his
job at <i>Little Caesar's</i> pizza.

274
00:14:51,677 --> 00:14:55,602
Our tireless work is obviously
being undermined by this one Jew.

275
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:59,745
Why does he go around pretending
to know the true will of the economy?

276
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:03,370
Perhaps he is the economy's
only son, sent to save us.

277
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,947
Are you retarded, Stotch!

278
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:11,495
The economy is omnipotent.
Which means it can do anything.

279
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:15,319
So saying it would be limited
to one son is fucking stupid!

280
00:15:15,901 --> 00:15:17,475
That is stupid, yeah.

281
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,752
And going around telling
people to shop is dangerous.

282
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,370
Well, then there's only one option.

283
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:27,635
- We have to kill the Jew.
- Yep, I think we gotta kill the Jew.

284
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,295
I don't know.
He's got a lot of support.

285
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,389
It might be hard
to even catch this Jew.

286
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,840
Did somebody say "catch a Jew"?

287
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:46,319
The person you are after might be
hard to get, but I can bring him to you.

288
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:48,820
And all I want in return...

289
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:52,600
is <i>GTA: Chinatown Wars</i>
for handheld Nintendo DS.

290
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,130
How can we help you, young man?

291
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:20,450
I want to return
this Margaritaville.

292
00:16:21,424 --> 00:16:23,744
My dad bought it on a payment
plan set up by a finance company

293
00:16:23,869 --> 00:16:25,396
that got investors from Wall Street

294
00:16:25,521 --> 00:16:28,278
who combined it into securities, sold
to banks who transfered it to you!

295
00:16:29,586 --> 00:16:30,936
That makes sense.

296
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:35,025
No problem. We just need
to consult the chart.

297
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:37,329
We can determine your property's
value and we'll be done.

298
00:16:38,432 --> 00:16:40,165
Really? Thank you.

299
00:16:40,735 --> 00:16:41,935
Be right back.

300
00:16:58,750 --> 00:16:59,891
Excellent news, sir.

301
00:17:00,016 --> 00:17:02,982
We've determined the investment
value of your Margaritaville to be

302
00:17:03,107 --> 00:17:04,257
$90 trillion!

303
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:07,942
What?

304
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,801
Hey, what's the matter, Kyle?
You seem... bummed out.

305
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:23,458
I just have a feeling this might
be the last time we get to do this.

306
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:26,916
Don't worry, Kyle. We're not
gonna let people kill you.

307
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,675
We'll keep you hidden forever!

308
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,875
I can't just hide
my whole life, Butters.

309
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,011
And besides,

310
00:17:32,136 --> 00:17:35,470
I have this strange feeling that
one of you is gonna totally betray me.

311
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:42,620
All right, whoever is thinking
of betraying Kyle, that is not cool.

312
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,485
That's fricking lame, dude.

313
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,905
Kyle's trying to get
the economy going again.

314
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:50,860
If somebody is thinking of stabbing
him in the back, you're being a dick.

315
00:17:52,595 --> 00:17:53,845
Go ahead, Kyle.

316
00:17:56,566 --> 00:17:58,846
Whoever it might happen to be,

317
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:01,413
I'm not giving him the opportunity.

318
00:18:02,484 --> 00:18:04,345
Tomorrow, I'm going to do something.

319
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:07,585
Something I've known I would have
to do to restore people's faith.

320
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:08,713
Kyle, please.

321
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:12,006
For... fuck's sake,
don't do anything drastic.

322
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:16,055
There's no choice anymore, guys.
Don't worry about me.

323
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,682
I've been preparing
for this for a while now.

324
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,684
No, no, no. Excuse me.
I don't understand.

325
00:18:23,243 --> 00:18:25,228
How can this stupid thing
be worth $90 trillion?

326
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,357
- What, you think it's worth more?
- No! Dude, that doesn't make sense.

327
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:33,278
Well, you don't get $90 trillion, but
the chart says that's what it's worth.

328
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,319
- Oh, problem! Problem again!
- What is it now?

329
00:18:36,444 --> 00:18:38,372
Another insurance company
is about to go under.

330
00:18:38,497 --> 00:18:40,195
If they do,
people could lose millions.

331
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,070
OK. No problem.
We better consult the chart.

332
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:51,155
Sir, another insurance
company is going under.

333
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,466
Now determining most prudent
move for insurance company!

334
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,277
- Bailout!
- Most prudent move is a bailout!

335
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,654
Bailout the insurance company!

336
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:26,020
It's a miracle.

337
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:29,965
- Why would someone do this?
- What is this? What's going on?

338
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:31,190
There. Look.

339
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,235
It's the Jew.

340
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,985
Somehow he got a platinum
Amex with no spending limit.

341
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,755
What's he doing?

342
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,638
He's... paying for everyone's debts.

343
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:49,112
Hey, thanks, kid.
This is really nice of you.

344
00:19:49,237 --> 00:19:52,315
But that's impossible.
Why would he do this?

345
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,526
So that people have money to spend.

346
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:57,915
Kyle! Kyle, you have to stop this!

347
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,175
It's OK, ma.

348
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,533
No, Kyle, you'll be in debt
for the rest of your life.

349
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,160
Please, somebody, get him to stop!

350
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,809
There's about $17,000 worth here.

351
00:20:25,201 --> 00:20:27,517
He paid for our debts
so we could spend once more.

352
00:20:29,787 --> 00:20:30,787
He's dead.

353
00:20:33,885 --> 00:20:36,860
No, he's just passed out.
We should get him to bed.

354
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:03,253
For the first time in almost a year,
the economy in South Park

355
00:21:03,378 --> 00:21:05,763
has taken a small,
but noticeable upturn.

356
00:21:06,514 --> 00:21:08,288
Stores and shopping malls
are open again

357
00:21:08,413 --> 00:21:11,853
as newly debt-free people feel
safe to make purchases.

358
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,931
The new Margaritaville!
With salsa dispenser!

359
00:21:16,056 --> 00:21:18,615
Just pour your favorite salsa in the top
and it comes out the dispenser

360
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,565
at the bottom!
Oh, we need this!

361
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:23,455
Are we out of the woods yet?
Only time will tell.

362
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,642
But we must not forget the sacrifice

363
00:21:25,767 --> 00:21:28,115
one person made
to restore our faith,

364
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,535
and make us believe
in the economy once again.

365
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:34,083
The person we must thank
every day for his amazing sacrifice...

366
00:21:34,863 --> 00:21:36,013
Barack Obama.

367
00:21:39,476 --> 00:21:40,798
Come on!

368
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,824
