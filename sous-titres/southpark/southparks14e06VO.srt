00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,918
<i>Saigon is a hell of a place.</i>

3
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:48,214
<i>I've seen a lot of death,
a lot of suffering.</i>

4
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,217
<i>Darkness that most people
couldn't stand to see.</i>

5
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:55,096
<i>I tried to sit it out
as much as I could.</i>

6
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,682
What's the matter, Conner?
Don't like a little blood?

7
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,393
<i>I don't like a little blood.</i>

8
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,480
<i>Blood ain't the stuff
for 18-year-old boys from Sheboygan.</i>

9
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,191
<i>Blood ain't the stuff
for Mitch Conner.</i>

10
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:08,318
Incoming!

11
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,782
Conner, Mitchell.
You're discharged.

12
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:20,080
<i>And that's that.
Pack your bags, you're headed home.</i>

13
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,873
<i>Hugs and kisses from Uncle Sam.</i>

14
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:24,709
<i>So how do I end up here,</i>

15
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:27,294
<i>with a 9-year-old kid
who wants to know who his father is?</i>

16
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,005
<i>Life is funny.</i>

17
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,341
<i>One day you're sifting
through the guts of some gook</i>

18
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:34,218
<i>and the next you're playing Dr. Phil
with some kid and his teacher.</i>

19
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,473
I'm really sorry
that you were put through all this.

20
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:42,102
Sorry is a four letter-word
with a Y on the end.

21
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,270
That doesn't mean anything
to this poor kid.

22
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:47,064
That's right.
Tell me the truth, now!

23
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:51,444
All I can tell you
is we were told to stick to the story,

24
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,655
to protect someone very important.

25
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,531
I can't say more.
I won't!

26
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,200
But...

27
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,410
I'll tell you who has the answer.

28
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,413
Look, gingers.

29
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:05,041
You said you wanted Muhammad.
We got him for you.

30
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:09,044
We can't know if he's really in there.
It could be a trick!

31
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:12,173
We went to the Super Best Friends
and brought him here.

32
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:15,843
Have him step out of the costume!
You have until the count of ten.

33
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,680
Don't do it.

34
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,723
If Muhammad is seen,
we could get bombed!

35
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:23,893
Idiot! If he isn't seen,
we're about to definitely get bombed!

36
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:27,772
All right, stop!
We'll do what you say.

37
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:29,816
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,610
Will you please
step out of the bear costume?

39
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,458
So, see?
Muhammad.

40
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,711
That isn't Muhammad,
that's Santa Claus.

41
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:54,132
- Sorry, I tried.
- Crap.

42
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,342
You got Santa to be Muhammad?
When?

43
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:59,094
When you said you were gonna hand
Muhammad over to Tom Cruise.

44
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:02,598
We promised Jesus that Muhammad
would stay safely in the U-Haul!

45
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,267
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,894
I really thought
my idea would work for you.

47
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:09,439
If we were gonna have
someone in a bear costume,

48
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:12,274
why would we actually have it be
Muhammad, you fucking idiot?

49
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,110
So where is he?

50
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:21,659
<i>Meanwhile,
at the hall of the Super Best Friends...</i>

51
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:28,208
Will you lay off that stuff already?
It's getting to be a problem.

52
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,294
And you're one to talk.
With all your Internet porn.

53
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,337
Watching porn
isn't like doing coke, fag!

54
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:34,463
Jesus Christ!

55
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,091
- What?
- We've got a distress signal coming in.

56
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,469
On the Super Best Screen!

57
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:43,223
<i>Super Best Friends,
you've got to help us!</i>

58
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,099
<i>The Casa Bonita is under attack!</i>

59
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,940
Great Scott!
It's Barbra Streisand!

60
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:59,822
I thought Barbra Streisand
had been destroyed by Robert Smith.

61
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,826
- Who would have activated her again?
- I don't know, Semen.

62
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,497
It's Seaman!

63
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,168
The Casa Bonita is gone!

64
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,961
Jesus, help us!

65
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,965
That's where those boys
took Muhammad.

66
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,591
We have to stop her!

67
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,678
On the Super Best Friends
power cycles!

68
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:44,284
There, there,
my little mouse friend.

69
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,245
Soon you will have more asses
than you ever dreamed of.

70
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,709
You brought me my Fonseca.
That's a good boy.

71
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,254
What's this?

72
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,047
Someone is at the door.

73
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,466
We've tried to be left alone.

74
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:03,928
Who would disturb us at this hour?
We must be careful.

75
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,681
Why, it's an African American man.

76
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,307
Yes?
What do you want?

77
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,270
Sorry to bother ya, but there's been
an accident down the street!

78
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,562
Can I use your phone?

79
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:17,066
I'm terribly sorry,
but I don't let strangers in.

80
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:20,236
I understand, but this is real bad.

81
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,280
My lady's legs
is all busted up and shit.

82
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:25,325
She's all crawling around on the road
lookin' like a crippled crab.

83
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,117
I just need an ambulance.

84
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:30,913
There's a gas station down the road.
They have a phone there.

85
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,125
I see.
I guess I understand.

86
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,043
You don't want a black man
in your house.

87
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,878
Please, it isn't that at all!

88
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:40,715
I gets it.
Thought things had changed though.

89
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,593
Thought with a black president,
things would be different.

90
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:47,430
We gots a black president, but whitey
still don't trust me use his phone.

91
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:51,226
Sorry, you're right.
We do have a black president.

92
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,393
Please, come in.

93
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:58,649
Nice work.

94
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,152
The old
"hasn't anything changed" speech.

95
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,153
Works on white people all the time.

96
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,616
Surprised to see me, asshole?

97
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,075
Close the door.

98
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:10,577
Holy crap!

99
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:15,666
Cheery ho!

100
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,710
My name is Pip.

101
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:21,589
I would like to see if you wouldn't mind
not smashing our little town to bits.

102
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,888
<i>Meanwhile, at the Legion of Doom,</i>

103
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:30,597
<i>which is Tom Cruise's house...</i>

104
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:34,018
How do you like that?
Celebrities can get violent too!

105
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,938
Please call Barbra Streisand off!

106
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,897
She's destroying everything!

107
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,483
We will call her off
when you give us Muhammad.

108
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,445
We don't have Muhammad.
We aren't sure where he is.

109
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,030
That's your problem!

110
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,824
Get him back
or Babs will kill you all!

111
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,284
Oh boy!

112
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,374
What the hell?
You should be watching Muhammad!

113
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,585
<i>I am!
He's right here.</i>

114
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,133
Thank God.
Hey, Muhammad.

115
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,884
Really sorry about all this.

116
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:10,179
So what the heck are we gonna do?
Muhammad isn't safe here.

117
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:13,349
The gingers and celebrities want him.
I don't know where we can go.

118
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,643
Wait.
Wait a minute.

119
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,812
- I've got it. I've totally got it!
- <i>What?</i>

120
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,398
Remember the time we got an elephant
to make love to a pig?

121
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,028
I know how to give the gingers
and the celebrities what they want,

122
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,112
but keep Muhammad safe.
Come on!

123
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:44,463
She's going to get
our coffee store next.

124
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,842
Jesus Christ!

125
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:56,893
That's enough, Barbra Streisand!

126
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:05,860
Try your ice breath!

127
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,577
- No good!
- Look out!

128
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:17,121
Barbra Streisand's using
her toxic stink ray!

129
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,839
Your father never wanted
this to happen.

130
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:30,134
- He was protecting you and them.
- Them who?

131
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,637
You have to understand,
it's all very complicated.

132
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:35,305
Then start explaining.

133
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,184
Very well.

134
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,936
Come on, the door is open.

135
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,396
Dr. Mephisto, we need you!

136
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:46,025
For crying out loud!
Now everybody's letting themselves in.

137
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,197
Doctor, this is Muhammad.
We want you to clone him.

138
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:54,283
So we can give his copies
to gingers and Barbra Streisand.

139
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:56,535
All right.

140
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:01,374
He's not doing anything
except explaining who my father is.

141
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:04,334
- That doesn't matter right now.
- It's all that matters!

142
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,879
Nobody gives a crap
about who your stupid father is!

143
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:10,215
Muhammad is an important issue
with actual ethical ramifications!

144
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,386
I guarantee you people care way more
about who my father is.

145
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,433
<i>In the small mountain town
of South Park,</i>

146
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,518
<i>the holy prophet
of the Mormon religion</i>

147
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,729
<i>is trying to fly up the nose
of a deadly female singer.</i>

148
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:30,569
Our powers aren't working, Swallow!

149
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,573
We can't attack Streisand's nose.
It's just too big!

150
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:36,075
We have to find another weak spot.
Moses!

151
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,285
What?

152
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:41,580
We need to know any weakness
Barbra Streisand might have.

153
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,459
Let me think.

154
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,130
I know.

155
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,217
Barbra Streisand can't resist
singing duets with Neil Diamond.

156
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,430
All right, I'll build a stage.

157
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,807
Lao Tsu, use mind control
to get a huge audience.

158
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,018
Buddha and Smith
use powers to find a band.

159
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,937
Semen, you and Swallow
go get us sushi for dinner.

160
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:08,565
It's Seaman and Swallow!

161
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,985
- Okay, you guys head off.
- Fine!

162
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,570
Swallow, come!

163
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,700
No way he just said that!

164
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,787
Tell Cartman who his dad is real quick
so we can clone Muhammad.

165
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,207
It's a complicated story.
I just can't tell him quickly.

166
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,835
Then we'll wait.
We have to clone Muhammad now.

167
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,630
Is he more important
than a little boy's broken heart?

168
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,547
You are not doing that again!

169
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,635
You tell this kid who his father is
and you do it now!

170
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,887
Stop talking with your stupid hand.

171
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:41,390
- Who you calling stupid, Jew?
- Come on, we are running out of time!

172
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,186
Sorry to bother you.

173
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,229
There's been an accident,
I need a phone!

174
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,483
Let me guess.
You're an African American.

175
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,736
I am, but I don't know
what that has to do with anything.

176
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,321
Beat it!
I'm not helping you!

177
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,864
- Dude!
- That's not cool!

178
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,449
You don't understand.

179
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,036
We understand you just sounded
like a freaking racist!

180
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,788
We don't live in the 60s any more.
We have a black president!

181
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:06,540
All right.
Jeez!

182
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:13,130
Crap.
The gingers!

183
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,423
Gingers?

184
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:17,968
<i>Later, at the Legion of Doom...</i>

185
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:22,848
The gingers are claiming
they have Muhammad!

186
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,725
What?
Impossible!

187
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,936
They are sending a message now!

188
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:27,936
On screen!

189
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:32,858
We got Muhammad!

190
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:34,276
We got Muhammad!

191
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,070
He's useless to you!

192
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:39,031
You can't get Muhammad's power
to not be made fun of,

193
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:42,159
without the Rob Reiner
goo transfer machine!

194
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,328
Why do you think we're calling?

195
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,497
Our boss is willing
to share Muhammad with you,

196
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:49,083
if you're willing to share
the goo machine with us.

197
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:51,711
Your boss?

198
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:53,962
What's going on?

199
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,507
You got what you wanted,
so let us go!

200
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,718
The head ginger has plans for you.

201
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,720
What head ginger?
And where is Cartman?

202
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:05,725
The head ginger has something
really special planned for him.

203
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,980
What is this?
Where am I?

204
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,898
You really got yourself in a mess.

205
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:15,401
Shut up. How about I shove
this flashlight in your mouth.

206
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:16,527
You...

207
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,157
I'm here, whoever you are.

208
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,705
I've waited a long time for this.

209
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:29,623
Daddy?

210
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,167
Guess again.

211
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:42,052
Welcome to my Chili Con Carnival!

212
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:44,889
Chili Con Carnival?

213
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,640
Wait a minute.

214
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,350
It can't be.

215
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:49,935
But it can!

216
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,355
Revenge is a dish best served...

217
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,316
chili!

218
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:57,568
Scott Tenorman?

219
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,198
<i>Meanwhile, at the concert stage</i>

220
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,659
<i>Jesus built with his power
of super carpentry...</i>

221
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,037
That's it!

222
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:11,039
The band has been paid
and the PA system is working.

223
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,751
All right, Krishna,
the rest is up to you.

224
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,545
Form of... Neil Diamond!

225
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,260
If you all wouldn't mind,

226
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,847
I'd like to invite a special friend
to join me on stage.

227
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,809
Miss Barbra Streisand!

228
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:38,192
Let's hope to Christ this works.

229
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,740
Hello, gorgeous.
What do you say?

230
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:47,243
Shall we sing together again
like the ol' times?

231
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,632
<i>Well, that's because
I loved you girl</i>

232
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,509
<i>And I still love you now</i>

233
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,678
<i>What have you got to say?</i>

234
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:11,267
<i>That might be true</i>

235
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,478
<i>But I still miss you at night</i>

236
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:22,736
<i>When you roll over by my side</i>

237
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:26,323
<i>And you kiss me goodnight</i>

238
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,536
It worked!

239
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,872
Now to find Muhammad
and take down Tom Cruise!

240
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,168
Do you remember
when you had my parents killed

241
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,836
and fed them to me as chili?

242
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,129
I spent a while
in a mental institution.

243
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,382
A lot of time for me
to learn everything

244
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:45,801
about you.

245
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,178
So that one day,
I could take you down.

246
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,181
I even learned
the name of your father.

247
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,935
I know you're confused,
who wouldn't be?

248
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,104
You've been lied to everyone.

249
00:14:57,689 --> 00:14:59,523
Even by your own mother.

250
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,818
What do you know?

251
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,322
I wanted to torment you
with your father's identity.

252
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:10,993
But what I found was more shocking
than I could have possibly guessed!

253
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:15,330
<i>Meanwhile, at the gingers' lair...</i>

254
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,624
All right, Muhammad is secure.

255
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,168
Let's do this.

256
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,253
Throw the switch.

257
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,723
I can feel it!

258
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,934
I can feel the power to not be ridiculed
flowing through my veins!

259
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,530
OMG!
It worked!

260
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,951
I've done it!

261
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,120
Look at me.
I'm not okay to make fun of anymore!

262
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:56,956
You lucky fucker!

263
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,127
Welcome, everyone,

264
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:05,547
to the final act
of my fabulous Chili Carnival!

265
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,924
Please!
Leave my boy alone!

266
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,427
- Mom?
- I got them all here for you,

267
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:13,263
to listen
while you got told the truth!

268
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,807
Please, don't!
We have to protect 'em.

269
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,769
- Protect who?
- Yes, protect who?

270
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,145
Tell him.

271
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:22,731
Mister... Jimbo!

272
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,067
Protect...

273
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,193
the Denver Broncos.

274
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:30,239
<i>Meanwhile...</i>

275
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,324
This is incredible!
Who wants to go next?

276
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,868
- I want to be next!
- No gingers go next!

277
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,995
Gingers can suck it.
I'm next.

278
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,039
It's my goo machine.
I'm next.

279
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,749
Nobody is going next!

280
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,128
Muhammad is our super best friend.
Let him go!

281
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,006
They can't stop all of us!
Get 'em!

282
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,848
The Denver Broncos.

283
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,600
There was a right tackle,

284
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:00,394
who had an illegitimate child
with your slut of a mom!

285
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,396
And everyone here covered it up,

286
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,189
to protect the Bronco name!

287
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,400
They were having a really good year.
There couldn't be any distractions.

288
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:11,155
- My dad was a Denver Bronco?
- Would you like to meet him?

289
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,615
You can't.
Ever.

290
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,075
'cause you see,

291
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:16,994
we have something in common.

292
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,163
Did I ever tell you
that my father...

293
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,623
played for the Denver Broncos?

294
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,212
The only Bronco
who lived in South Park.

295
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:30,965
He got a little bored and had an affair
with a slut named Liane Cartman.

296
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:32,133
No, please!

297
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,218
Tell him!

298
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:36,846
You almost did before but you got shot
by your brother who was a Bronco fan.

299
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,348
It's true.

300
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,017
Jack Tenorman was your father.

301
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,896
You killed your own father

302
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:47,441
and then you fed him
to your half brother!

303
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,406
Now, eat your chili!

304
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:00,079
The Super Best Friends?

305
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,334
I'll get you, Tom Cruise!

306
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,714
Look! Tom Cruise
has Seaman on his back.

307
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,676
What did you say?

308
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,096
Tom Cruise
does have Seaman on his back.

309
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,391
I guess maybe Tom Cruise
likes Seaman.

310
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,397
You're not supposed
to make fun of me anymore!

311
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,564
What's going on?

312
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:29,566
I'll be back, Super Best Friends!

313
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,904
Who's the creepy ginger kid?

314
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:37,574
You said the goo machine would work,
but I got made fun of!

315
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,285
That's because there is no goo!

316
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,956
You see, I learned something today.

317
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,725
That's right.
Don't you see, gingers.

318
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,441
That's right, friends.

319
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:31,086
All right.
Let's start rebuilding our town,

320
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,379
for the 39th time.

321
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,341
Dude, look.

322
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:48,561
We know what you learned
would pretty tough to hear.

323
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,273
Tough to hear?

324
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,775
My dad was Scott Tenorman's dad!

325
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,361
Don't you guys realize
what that means?

326
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,571
Yeah, we know what it means.

327
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,408
My dad was a ginger!

328
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:04,786
Wait!
What?

329
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,664
I mean, obviously
I take after my mom,

330
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,250
but I have the ginger gene
inside of me!

331
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:14,087
You killed your own dad
and you're worried about that?

332
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:18,884
What?

333
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:22,054
- Come on, cheer up.
- Cheer up? I'm half ginger!

334
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:26,225
But you're forgetting.
You're also half Denver Bronco.

335
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,476
That makes you pretty cool.

336
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,355
You're right.

337
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,648
That does make me pretty cool.

338
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:35,275
You gotta be kidding me!

339
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,402
Shut up.
You dumb Jew.

340
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,864
You've got Bronco blood in you.
That makes you awesome.

341
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:42,907
Me?
I should be moving on.

342
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,576
Really, you gotta go?

343
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:47,788
There's a bounty on my head.
I can't stay in one place for too long.

344
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,373
So long,

345
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,749
Denver Bronco.

346
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,960
Take it easy.

347
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:00,884
Look,

348
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:04,972
I'm sorry I said you were a fudge packer
and that you had Seaman on your back.

349
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,724
I just can't do it anymore.

350
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,643
I wanna go away.

351
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:13,522
But there's nowhere on earth
that people aren't around to rip on me.

352
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,192
We know a place.

353
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:19,611
A place where everything
is just happiness and joy.

354
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:21,530
And no humans
are there to mess it up.

355
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:22,698
We do?

356
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:24,699
We do!

357
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:25,868
Really?

358
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,870
Somewhere where I can
live out my days in peace and quiet?

359
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,414
Can you show me where?

360
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,668
We'll do better than that.
We'll help you to get there.
