South Park - Season 12 Episode 05
"Eek, a Penis!"

2
00:00:34,873 --> 00:00:39,170
It's like, my whole life has
just been one big screw-up, you know?

3
00:00:39,591 --> 00:00:42,614
I admit it, I was I was sexually lost.

4
00:00:42,938 --> 00:00:45,138
And then I see this person on Oprah.

5
00:00:45,258 --> 00:00:48,293
She was a woman but then she got
a sex change, became a man, but...

6
00:00:48,413 --> 00:00:50,130
then she got pregnant
and is having a baby,

7
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,595
which means she's
still a woman all along.

8
00:00:52,715 --> 00:00:55,027
That means I'm really
still a man, I'm...

9
00:00:55,147 --> 00:00:57,687
I still feel like a man.

10
00:00:58,073 --> 00:01:00,173
Are we gonna get tested on this?

11
00:01:00,384 --> 00:01:03,515
The sex change was a big mistake, okay?

12
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:06,673
I was on a lot of
painkillers at the time

13
00:01:06,793 --> 00:01:08,793
and I thought it was what I wanted.

14
00:01:08,913 --> 00:01:10,844
Dude, wanna do some math problems?

15
00:01:10,964 --> 00:01:13,024
And then, I go to the doctor, right?

16
00:01:13,144 --> 00:01:16,358
And I say "Doctor, I wanna
go back to being a man," and he says

17
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:19,384
"There's been too much damage.
You can't go back.

18
00:01:19,504 --> 00:01:21,587
Where are you going to find a penis?"

19
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:24,260
Whattaya mean,
where am I gonna find a penis?

20
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:27,874
I'm a man! I deserve a Goddamned penis!

21
00:01:31,832 --> 00:01:34,005
Mr. Gar- Mr. Garrison!

22
00:01:34,818 --> 00:01:37,050
Could we speak with you please?

23
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:40,342
What do you want? I'm trying to teach.

24
00:01:40,462 --> 00:01:42,683
Uh, we think it's best you not teach

25
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:45,153
until you get your personal
life in order, m'kay?

26
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:49,437
Oh it's so easy for you, Mackey!
You have a penis!

27
00:01:49,873 --> 00:01:51,515
Okay students, um,

28
00:01:51,635 --> 00:01:55,318
obviously we've had a little
emergency with your teacher, so uh,

29
00:01:55,578 --> 00:01:58,195
while we deal with this,
we need one of you to lead the class

30
00:01:58,315 --> 00:01:59,989
and review for tomorrow's quiz.

31
00:02:01,071 --> 00:02:02,624
Me! Me me! Me!

32
00:02:02,984 --> 00:02:04,750
Me! Right here! Right here!

33
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:08,820
Who else would like to be
teacher for the day? Anybody else?

34
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,836
Principal Victoria. Right over here.

35
00:02:13,464 --> 00:02:15,564
Any other volunteers, perhaps?

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,694
Principal Victoria. Principal.

37
00:02:19,814 --> 00:02:22,095
All right, all right, fine.
Eric, you lead the class.

38
00:02:22,355 --> 00:02:23,399
Yes!

39
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:25,604
Now, just lead a review
over whatever Mr. Garrison's

40
00:02:25,724 --> 00:02:28,685
been teaching you, and I'll
be back to check on you shortly.

41
00:02:31,743 --> 00:02:33,383
Well well well.

42
00:02:34,286 --> 00:02:36,336
Who's teacher now?

43
00:02:37,298 --> 00:02:38,329
Yeah.

44
00:02:38,528 --> 00:02:41,567
- Who's teacher?
- You're not the teacher, fatass.

45
00:02:41,687 --> 00:02:43,460
That's Mr. Cartman now, Kyle!

46
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,933
And you will be wise not to interrupt my
class unless you want to be suspended!

47
00:02:48,053 --> 00:02:49,053
Yeah.

48
00:02:50,548 --> 00:02:52,041
Yeah, you like that?

49
00:02:53,604 --> 00:02:56,354
All right, Clyde, you're first!
Get up here!

50
00:02:57,091 --> 00:02:59,391
Yeah, you're gonna take it, Clyde.

51
00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:07,271
<i>And so it appears that
the local farmer's market</i>

52
00:03:07,391 --> 00:03:10,268
<i>could be soon facing complete closure.</i>

53
00:03:10,655 --> 00:03:14,770
<i>In other news tonight, a South
Park bio company is coming under fire</i>

54
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:18,944
<i>for genetically engineering body
parts onto laboratory mice.</i>

55
00:03:19,064 --> 00:03:23,114
<i>This picture of a mouse genetically
altered to grow a human ear</i>

56
00:03:23,234 --> 00:03:25,998
<i>has already sparked waves of protest.</i>

57
00:03:26,118 --> 00:03:27,118
What?

58
00:03:27,378 --> 00:03:30,689
<i>But the scientists say the
process could help thousands of people</i>

59
00:03:30,809 --> 00:03:33,792
<i>who've become disfigured
and need ears or noses.</i>

60
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,304
Holy Freaking Jesus.

61
00:03:39,313 --> 00:03:41,877
Using common genetics
and cartilage scaffolding,

62
00:03:41,997 --> 00:03:45,620
we can graft almost any body part
onto a mouse and allow it to develop.

63
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,794
Here's the mouse you saw on television.

64
00:03:47,914 --> 00:03:51,699
Once the ear fully forms,
it can be transplanted onto a person.

65
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:53,834
Doctor, what about a penis?

66
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:58,476
Well, a penis is something
a man puts into a woman's vagina.

67
00:03:58,596 --> 00:04:01,102
No, no. If I gave you some of my DNA,

68
00:04:01,222 --> 00:04:03,029
could you grow a penis
on a mouse for me?

69
00:04:03,289 --> 00:04:06,235
You don't understand: doing
this stuff is very expensive.

70
00:04:06,355 --> 00:04:09,369
And we've never tried a penis before ;
there's no guarantee it would work.

71
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:13,214
I will give you all the money
I have to just try. Please.

72
00:04:13,334 --> 00:04:16,918
Doctor, I'm a man trapped
in a woman's body. I need a penis.

73
00:04:17,178 --> 00:04:20,378
All right. All right,
let's see what we can do.

74
00:04:21,167 --> 00:04:25,093
Eric, we've called you in to commend
you for your role as student teacher.

75
00:04:25,618 --> 00:04:29,082
Ey! Don't commend me! It's
the students'fault for being so stupid!

76
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:32,058
Uh, "commend" means you've
done a great job, Eric. Hm'kay?

77
00:04:32,318 --> 00:04:34,313
After leading your class through review,

78
00:04:34,433 --> 00:04:37,797
your schoolmates scored higher
than they ever had on their tests.

79
00:04:37,917 --> 00:04:40,108
Whatever you did really worked on them.

80
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,918
Oh, well, thank you.

81
00:04:42,038 --> 00:04:44,629
I believe strict discipline along
with compassion for my students

82
00:04:44,749 --> 00:04:46,355
is catamite to their learning.

83
00:04:46,475 --> 00:04:48,263
These gentlemen from
the Denver County School Board

84
00:04:48,383 --> 00:04:50,215
have something they want to ask you.

85
00:04:50,335 --> 00:04:52,604
Young man, word of your
success as a student teacher

86
00:04:52,724 --> 00:04:54,377
has started the whole board thinking.

87
00:04:54,497 --> 00:04:57,808
We would like you to try your methods
on one of our inner-city school classes.

88
00:04:57,928 --> 00:05:01,012
These kids just won't listen
to any adult teachers and,

89
00:05:01,132 --> 00:05:05,133
since you handled your class so well,
how would you like to give it a shot?

90
00:05:05,393 --> 00:05:07,310
That sounds like a chance
to really make an impact

91
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,056
on some students who need it most.

92
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:10,638
How much will you pay me?

93
00:05:12,925 --> 00:05:15,664
Three hundred bucks!
Did you hear what I said, you guys?

94
00:05:15,784 --> 00:05:18,962
My awesome teaching skill is
gonna earn me three. Hundred. Bucks.

95
00:05:19,082 --> 00:05:20,915
You're not an awesome teacher!

96
00:05:21,035 --> 00:05:23,960
Whatever. The class scored
super-high on the test.

97
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,981
The only reason we scored
high was because we took

98
00:05:26,101 --> 00:05:28,072
the answers out of Garrison's desk!
And you know it!

99
00:05:28,332 --> 00:05:31,534
Yes, but whose idea was it to take
the answers out of Garrison's desk?

100
00:05:31,794 --> 00:05:32,794
Kenny's!

101
00:05:32,989 --> 00:05:34,930
- (Yeah, that was my idea.)
- Oh yeah.

102
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,683
But whatever, I'm gonna go teach those
underprivileged inner-city students 

103
00:05:37,803 --> 00:05:39,756
and really turns their lives around.

104
00:05:39,876 --> 00:05:42,076
Do you know what those
kids are going to do to you?

105
00:05:42,196 --> 00:05:44,818
A little middle-class white
boy telling them what to do?

106
00:05:44,938 --> 00:05:47,288
They are going to fucking murder you!

107
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,016
Maybe he's right.
I'd better be careful how I look.

108
00:06:21,476 --> 00:06:24,282
Students, quiet! Quiet please!

109
00:06:27,423 --> 00:06:29,008
Give me your attention!

110
00:06:29,268 --> 00:06:32,637
I'll give you my attention.
All night long, Mrs. Miller.

111
00:06:34,607 --> 00:06:37,695
You're on thin ice, Rodriguez!
Now listen up!

112
00:06:37,815 --> 00:06:42,230
The Denver County School Board
has sent over a special guest teacher.

113
00:06:44,242 --> 00:06:47,443
This may be your last shot
at graduating from high school at all!

114
00:06:47,703 --> 00:06:51,208
I want you to welcome... Eric Cartmanez

115
00:06:54,682 --> 00:06:55,862
Hello students.

116
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:59,414
I'm Eric Cartmanez. Your new teacher.

117
00:07:01,994 --> 00:07:03,376
What the hell is this?

118
00:07:03,636 --> 00:07:07,505
I am here... to teach you calculus.

119
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:13,951
I think you're going to be very
pleased with the progress, Ms. Garrison.

120
00:07:14,071 --> 00:07:15,221
Mr. Garrison!

121
00:07:15,481 --> 00:07:17,131
Sorry, Mister Garrison.

122
00:07:17,418 --> 00:07:21,723
Your DNA has replicated and grafted
very successfully with the mouse.

123
00:07:21,843 --> 00:07:22,893
And so...

124
00:07:23,086 --> 00:07:24,439
here's your penis.

125
00:07:27,657 --> 00:07:29,568
My penis looks great!

126
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:33,025
Yes. It's a fantastic penis.
Congratulations.

127
00:07:33,524 --> 00:07:35,087
How long before it's ready?

128
00:07:35,207 --> 00:07:38,119
Well, it still has some forming to do,
but fairly soon.

129
00:07:38,544 --> 00:07:40,787
Let me see if it feels right in my hand.

130
00:07:40,907 --> 00:07:42,373
No! Don't open the-

131
00:07:42,633 --> 00:07:44,000
Whoa no!

132
00:07:46,345 --> 00:07:48,445
Don't let it get out of the lab!

133
00:07:50,182 --> 00:07:51,441
My penis!

134
00:07:55,164 --> 00:07:57,408
Stop, penis! Come back here!

135
00:07:58,605 --> 00:08:02,894
Okay, everyone take a sillibus
and pass it to the amigo behind you.

136
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:06,272
Hey man, what the hell
do you think you're doing?

137
00:08:06,848 --> 00:08:09,734
Mr. Cartmanez is here to make
sure you all get into college.

138
00:08:09,994 --> 00:08:12,945
Getting into college? Man, we
ain't getting in no college! Fuck you!

139
00:08:17,722 --> 00:08:20,179
How do I reach these kids?

140
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:24,689
The reason that you think
you can't get into college

141
00:08:24,809 --> 00:08:27,960
is because you haven't been taught...
how to cheat properly!

142
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,811
How do you think white
people always get ahead?

143
00:08:30,931 --> 00:08:34,967
Because we cheat all the time-
I mean because they cheat all the time.

144
00:08:37,048 --> 00:08:40,984
This is Bill Belichick,
coach of the New England Patriots.

145
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:43,427
He's won three Super Bowls. How?

146
00:08:43,547 --> 00:08:44,647
He cheated.

147
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:48,284
He even got caught cheating,
and nobody cared.

148
00:08:48,404 --> 00:08:51,067
Bill Belichick proved that
in America it's okay to cheat.

149
00:08:51,327 --> 00:08:53,778
As long as you cheat
your way to the top.

150
00:08:54,268 --> 00:08:56,114
Hey, I don't wanna be called a cheater!

151
00:08:56,374 --> 00:08:59,874
No no. If you cheat and fail,
you're a cheater.

152
00:09:00,118 --> 00:09:03,454
If you cheat and succeed, you're savvy.

153
00:09:03,714 --> 00:09:07,375
This is bullshit. I don't wanna
waste my time learning to cheat.

154
00:09:07,846 --> 00:09:11,295
Go ahead, the door's right there.
Bye-bye, have fun, we will miss you.

155
00:09:14,843 --> 00:09:17,286
How do I reach these kids?

156
00:09:21,241 --> 00:09:22,391
Boys!

157
00:09:22,654 --> 00:09:25,004
Boys, have you seen my penis?

158
00:09:26,975 --> 00:09:29,451
- What?
- My penis is on the loose!

159
00:09:29,571 --> 00:09:32,108
If you see it, just try
to catch it with some cheese.

160
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,650
That hurt my brain.

161
00:09:48,353 --> 00:09:49,584
Nice form, compadre.

162
00:09:50,183 --> 00:09:52,531
Hey, I walked out of your class,
teacher.

163
00:09:52,651 --> 00:09:55,355
Look, I don't wanna argue with
you about the merits of cheating.

164
00:09:55,475 --> 00:09:57,535
Who wants to argue
on a nice day like this?

165
00:09:57,655 --> 00:09:59,705
How about a little pickup game?

166
00:09:59,928 --> 00:10:00,928
Hey, paisano.

167
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:04,682
- Can you keep score for us?
- Sure thing, Mr. C.

168
00:10:05,383 --> 00:10:07,633
Okay, you start on defense, amigo.

169
00:10:14,775 --> 00:10:16,925
Oh, that's one to nothing, amigo!

170
00:10:17,307 --> 00:10:19,868
- You cheated!
- What's the score, ese?

171
00:10:19,988 --> 00:10:21,788
Okay, let's go, your turn.

172
00:10:28,232 --> 00:10:30,200
That's two to nothing, amigo.

173
00:10:30,476 --> 00:10:32,600
Fuck you, man, you can't do that!

174
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,120
Look at the scoreboard, amigo.

175
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,879
No matter how many
times you say I cheated,

176
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:40,635
the scoreboard says two, nothing.

177
00:10:41,325 --> 00:10:45,425
I know what you're trying to say,
but I still don't agree with it.

178
00:10:46,516 --> 00:10:48,016
Two to nothing, ese!

179
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:49,894
Two to nothing!

180
00:10:51,739 --> 00:10:54,005
How do I reach these kids?

181
00:11:00,331 --> 00:11:01,739
What is that?

182
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:15,483
- Steven! Steven come quick!
- What is it, dear?

183
00:11:15,603 --> 00:11:17,753
A penis is loose in our kitchen!

184
00:11:18,241 --> 00:11:21,259
- A penis?
- Yes! It just ran across the floor!

185
00:11:21,669 --> 00:11:23,319
Now darling, calm down.

186
00:11:23,661 --> 00:11:27,166
Calm down nothing! I don't want
that penis running through my house!

187
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:30,159
Ho, women. Always afraid of penises.

188
00:11:34,012 --> 00:11:37,316
- There! There, you see it?
- Oh, it's just a little penis, darling.

189
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:40,111
I don't care. It's probably
got all kinds of diseases.

190
00:11:41,912 --> 00:11:43,965
Hey wait! I think
that's teacher's penis!

191
00:11:44,085 --> 00:11:46,617
- Your teacher's penis?
- Yeah, that must be his.

192
00:11:46,877 --> 00:11:50,593
Butters, how do you know what
your teacher's penis looks like?

193
00:11:51,007 --> 00:11:52,007
Huh?

194
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:55,793
Today we will discuss one
of the fundamental ways to cheat:

195
00:11:56,206 --> 00:11:58,212
getting material ahead of time.

196
00:11:58,472 --> 00:12:01,294
When Bill Belichick cheated
for the Patriots, what did he do?

197
00:12:01,414 --> 00:12:04,454
He videotaped the
opposing team's defense.

198
00:12:04,574 --> 00:12:06,782
Think of the defense as your test.

199
00:12:06,902 --> 00:12:10,473
When taking a test you
must also videotape the defense

200
00:12:10,985 --> 00:12:13,820
Learn what's on the test
before they give it to you.

201
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,187
And that way you can-

202
00:12:17,994 --> 00:12:21,294
I thought that...
well maybe I can give cheating a try.

203
00:12:22,356 --> 00:12:23,676
Have a seat, amigo.

204
00:12:23,796 --> 00:12:25,323
Good to have you back.

205
00:12:26,173 --> 00:12:29,623
All right. Now, when Bill Belichick
got caught with his camera,

206
00:12:29,743 --> 00:12:30,761
he did not panic.

207
00:12:30,881 --> 00:12:33,387
He simply said what every
good white cheater says when caught:

208
00:12:33,507 --> 00:12:35,666
"I mis-interpreted the rules."

209
00:12:36,435 --> 00:12:38,360
It's what you must also
say when caught cheating!

210
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,145
"I mis-interpreted the rules."

211
00:12:40,265 --> 00:12:42,836
- Say it with me.
- "I mis-interpreted the rules."

212
00:12:42,956 --> 00:12:45,633
- Good. Again.
- "I mis-interpreted the rules."

213
00:12:45,753 --> 00:12:48,429
- Again!
- "I mis-interpreted the rules."

214
00:12:48,689 --> 00:12:52,350
- Now you sound like white people!
- "I mis-interpreted the rules!"

215
00:12:53,157 --> 00:12:57,023
What the hell do you mean
you just put my penis outside?

216
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:58,616
Why didn't you call me?

217
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:02,394
Look Garrison, my wife didn't want a
penis in the house. I had to get it out.

218
00:13:02,514 --> 00:13:06,114
Well now how am I supposed to find it?
It could be anywhere!

219
00:13:08,618 --> 00:13:09,867
Holy Crap!

220
00:13:12,801 --> 00:13:14,438
Carole, get down from there!

221
00:13:14,558 --> 00:13:17,258
No Didn't you see that penis just now?

222
00:13:18,349 --> 00:13:22,149
I'm sure that penis is way
more scared of you than you are of it.

223
00:13:22,412 --> 00:13:23,923
You saw a penis?

224
00:13:26,718 --> 00:13:28,931
Oh, it's so big and disgusting!

225
00:13:35,263 --> 00:13:37,112
Come back here, penis!

226
00:13:38,907 --> 00:13:40,773
There you are! Got you!

227
00:13:43,935 --> 00:13:46,512
Hey, you're not my penis.

228
00:13:49,877 --> 00:13:51,777
Oh! There it goes! Stop you!

229
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,216
The answer to #27 is 5.

230
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:59,462
"The answer to #27 is 5."

231
00:13:59,582 --> 00:14:02,311
The answer to #28 is 14.

232
00:14:02,431 --> 00:14:05,131
"The answer to #28 is 14."

233
00:14:05,464 --> 00:14:07,064
Man, what's the point?

234
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:09,414
What's the point of any of this?

235
00:14:12,056 --> 00:14:14,823
All right, everyone review
the section on sportscasters

236
00:14:14,943 --> 00:14:16,688
forgiving the Patriots for cheating
and saying it was no big deal.

237
00:14:16,808 --> 00:14:18,018
I'll be right back.

238
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,630
Melita! Melita, hold on.

239
00:14:22,834 --> 00:14:25,658
You can't quit now.
Come on, what's wrong with you?

240
00:14:25,778 --> 00:14:27,878
There isn't any point to all this.

241
00:14:27,998 --> 00:14:29,613
I won't be going to college.

242
00:14:30,288 --> 00:14:32,188
I'm pregnant, all right?

243
00:14:32,751 --> 00:14:36,503
I just found out, and Eduardo
isn't going to help me raise it.

244
00:14:37,518 --> 00:14:39,905
How do I reach these kids?

245
00:14:41,127 --> 00:14:42,793
All right, let's go get you an abortion.

246
00:14:43,242 --> 00:14:46,714
No. I'm Catholic.
I think abortion is wrong.

247
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,384
Abortion isn't wrong! What's
the one thing I've been teaching you?

248
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,898
- That cheating is good?
- Yes!

249
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,291
And abortion is the
ultimate form of cheating!

250
00:14:56,411 --> 00:14:58,761
You're cheating nature itself.

251
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,367
Why do rich white
girls get ahead in life?

252
00:15:01,487 --> 00:15:03,554
Because they get abortions
when they're young.

253
00:15:03,674 --> 00:15:06,503
They get pregnant, but they still
want to go to college, so, whatever,

254
00:15:06,623 --> 00:15:07,694
they just cheat.

255
00:15:07,814 --> 00:15:11,849
They cheat that little critter in their
belly right out of a chance at life.

256
00:15:11,969 --> 00:15:13,537
I don't know, Mr. C.

257
00:15:13,657 --> 00:15:15,493
Mexicans are told not to cheat.

258
00:15:15,613 --> 00:15:18,468
"Don't cheat! You got pregnant?
You have to raise the child."

259
00:15:18,588 --> 00:15:19,797
So then you have to raise the child

260
00:15:19,917 --> 00:15:21,072
while the white girls
get to go to college

261
00:15:21,192 --> 00:15:23,792
and probably have
a bunch more abortions.

262
00:15:24,741 --> 00:15:26,991
It is at our most challenging times

263
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,954
that we must cheat... our very hardest.

264
00:15:33,173 --> 00:15:36,180
And the last time you saw
your penis was two days ago?

265
00:15:36,696 --> 00:15:37,696
That's right.

266
00:15:37,816 --> 00:15:41,560
- Long whiskers or short?
- Short, and little fluffy ears.

267
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,589
Fluffy ears, okay.

268
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,653
- Think you got it, Mitch?
- I think so, sir.

269
00:15:45,773 --> 00:15:47,525
Is this pretty close?

270
00:15:51,072 --> 00:15:53,198
No, no, not like that!

271
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:54,658
That's just silly.

272
00:15:54,778 --> 00:15:57,910
Sir, we might wanna get a unit down
to the Italian restaurant on Kentner.

273
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:00,140
- What is it?
- Call just came through.

274
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,583
Seems a penis broke in
and tried to eat their cheese.

275
00:16:02,703 --> 00:16:03,856
Well come on!

276
00:16:11,874 --> 00:16:13,926
- What's the matter?
- A penis!

277
00:16:14,513 --> 00:16:15,844
A penis? Where?

278
00:16:16,345 --> 00:16:17,445
There it is!

279
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:26,434
- Where is it?
- Look, there!

280
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:28,799
Come on!

281
00:16:29,827 --> 00:16:32,670
What's a that penis
doing ina my kitchen?

282
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:36,240
Hey! Don't you dare kill my penis!

283
00:16:37,793 --> 00:16:40,077
Crap! We've gotta go back around!

284
00:16:51,264 --> 00:16:53,564
Someone

285
00:16:53,684 --> 00:16:55,960
Somewhere

286
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,471
Is loving me tonight

287
00:16:59,731 --> 00:17:03,092
Looking at the same moon

288
00:17:03,212 --> 00:17:06,507
And seeing the same light

289
00:17:06,627 --> 00:17:10,074
Someone, somewhere

290
00:17:10,194 --> 00:17:13,777
Is feeling my despair

291
00:17:13,897 --> 00:17:17,250
And this same moon is
making them think of the-

292
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,470
There it is!

293
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:25,253
No! No!

294
00:17:25,373 --> 00:17:26,373
No!

295
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:27,650
No!

296
00:17:28,544 --> 00:17:30,189
There's not a chance now.

297
00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:32,130
No we, we can find it!

298
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,025
Sorry Garrison, your penis is gone.

299
00:17:35,832 --> 00:17:37,804
Afraid there's nothing more we can do.

300
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:40,324
You'll just have to
live with being a woman.

301
00:17:40,444 --> 00:17:42,794
A very ugly one. Come on, men.

302
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:49,229
Students, I want to congratulate
you on your amazing test scores.

303
00:17:49,585 --> 00:17:52,462
The school board is so
impressed with your progress

304
00:17:52,582 --> 00:17:54,604
that they are going to let you take

305
00:17:54,724 --> 00:17:58,364
the standardized advanced
placement test for college credit.

306
00:18:00,584 --> 00:18:02,302
The test is going
to be heavily monitored

307
00:18:02,422 --> 00:18:04,272
in a private room at their location

308
00:18:04,392 --> 00:18:07,690
to assure that there
can be absolutely no cheating.

309
00:18:08,722 --> 00:18:09,722
Uh what?

310
00:18:09,842 --> 00:18:12,836
The test will be tomorrow.
Make us proud.

311
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,039
Monitor us in a private room?

312
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:19,426
Now they're gonna know
we've been cheating all along.

313
00:18:19,686 --> 00:18:21,191
I knew it man!

314
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:24,056
You made us believe in your
way and now it's all for nothing!

315
00:18:24,316 --> 00:18:25,405
It's not for nothing.

316
00:18:25,525 --> 00:18:27,101
If you're good enough,
you can cheat right in front of them.

317
00:18:27,433 --> 00:18:29,645
Shut up, man! You really screwed us all!

318
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:33,107
How do I reach these kids?

319
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,021
Just before the last Super Bowl,

320
00:18:38,141 --> 00:18:40,842
Bill Belichick gathered
his football players and said,

321
00:18:40,962 --> 00:18:44,658
"Let's win this one for real.
Just this one time."

322
00:18:44,778 --> 00:18:47,538
"Let's not cheat."
You know what happened?

323
00:18:47,798 --> 00:18:48,948
They lost.

324
00:18:50,175 --> 00:18:52,993
Even if you feel all eyes are upon you,

325
00:18:53,113 --> 00:18:55,563
you cannot give up on cheating!

326
00:18:55,939 --> 00:18:59,341
Or else you can lose the
biggest game of your lives.

327
00:18:59,895 --> 00:19:01,927
Yeah, come on, we can do this, guys.

328
00:19:02,953 --> 00:19:06,058
You are the true dreamers.
Tomorrow you will prove it.

329
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:07,927
We will begin by reviewing
how to print out cheat sheets

330
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:10,227
as labels for your bottled water.

331
00:19:16,785 --> 00:19:19,135
You did this to yourself, Garrison.

332
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:23,076
Get your hopes up with
a stupid genetic experiment

333
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:26,346
and now all your money's
gone along with your penis.

334
00:19:32,108 --> 00:19:33,308
Well what the?

335
00:19:37,925 --> 00:19:38,538
Why...

336
00:19:39,398 --> 00:19:40,948
It's my penis.

337
00:19:42,984 --> 00:19:44,614
My penis came back.

338
00:19:45,111 --> 00:19:46,361
But why?

339
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:54,354
I guess it's true.
What's that old saying?

340
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:58,178
"If you love your penis, let it go..."

341
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,940
The standardized advanced
placement test

342
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,904
is considered one of the most difficult

343
00:20:06,024 --> 00:20:08,827
and carefully monitored
tests in the country.

344
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:11,190
Twenty-four of our
students took the test

345
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:15,417
and all twenty-four scored 100%

346
00:20:18,699 --> 00:20:21,368
- Uh, can we say something?
- Sure.

347
00:20:21,488 --> 00:20:23,849
We would like to present
this plaque to the person

348
00:20:23,969 --> 00:20:26,242
who taught us the White People Method.

349
00:20:26,362 --> 00:20:27,846
Mr. Cartmanez!

350
00:20:39,993 --> 00:20:43,118
I reached these kids.

351
00:20:45,726 --> 00:20:47,426
Students and faculty,

352
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:51,356
please put your hands together
and help me in welcoming back,

353
00:20:51,476 --> 00:20:53,199
Mister Garrison.

354
00:20:59,571 --> 00:21:02,381
Thanks everyone. It's great to be back.

355
00:21:02,879 --> 00:21:04,530
I'm a man again.

356
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:07,081
Thanks to my very special new friend.

357
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:10,951
But you know,

358
00:21:11,071 --> 00:21:14,235
I've learned that I've
really been a dude all along.

359
00:21:14,764 --> 00:21:17,372
Because the key difference
between men and women

360
00:21:17,492 --> 00:21:20,117
is that women can have babies.

361
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:23,987
If you can't have babies,
then, you're a man.

362
00:21:24,926 --> 00:21:26,758
Whoa uh wait, uh, hang on a second.

363
00:21:26,878 --> 00:21:28,739
My wife had ovarian cancer,

364
00:21:28,859 --> 00:21:30,784
so she can't have babies.

365
00:21:31,514 --> 00:21:35,455
Well then get an AIDS test, Thompson,
'cause your wife's a dude, faggot!

366
00:21:37,836 --> 00:21:39,686
Yeah! I'm back!

367
00:21:41,054 --> 00:21:44,761
