00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,342
Look at Kenny's lunch!
A bologna sandwich and a water!

4
00:00:40,156 --> 00:00:41,628
Goddamn, your family's poor!

5
00:00:42,016 --> 00:00:44,449
You fellas wanna go see
<i>High School Musical 3</i> tonight?

6
00:00:44,574 --> 00:00:46,571
Bunch of kids are gonna go
see it again.

7
00:00:46,696 --> 00:00:48,626
What's <i>High School Musical 3</i>?

8
00:00:48,751 --> 00:00:51,137
You know, the sequel
to <i>High School Musical 1</i> and two.

9
00:00:51,438 --> 00:00:53,312
What's <i>High School Musical 1</i> and 2?

10
00:00:53,437 --> 00:00:56,165
There's not even condiments
on his bologna sandwich!

11
00:00:57,332 --> 00:00:59,233
What's <i>High School Musical 1</i>
and... Dude!

12
00:00:59,358 --> 00:01:01,898
It's only the most popular thing
with kids in our age group!

13
00:01:02,376 --> 00:01:04,378
Yeah, where the hell
have you guys been?

14
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:06,061
Peru.

15
00:01:09,251 --> 00:01:12,892
And then I saw <i>High School Musical 3</i>
again on Friday and guess who was there?

16
00:01:13,123 --> 00:01:14,077
Bridon Guermo.

17
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,496
Bridon Guermo?
He's such a dream!

18
00:01:16,887 --> 00:01:20,535
I'd give anything to be with him.
But he'd never go for me, I'm nobody.

19
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:21,848
That's not true, red.

20
00:01:21,973 --> 00:01:23,878
Everyone has something
that makes them unique.

21
00:01:24,406 --> 00:01:27,006
<i>Everyone is special in their own way</i>

22
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:30,009
<i>Move to the beat
And let your spirit out</i>

23
00:01:30,231 --> 00:01:33,595
<i>As long as we got each other
We'll never have any trouble</i>

24
00:01:33,757 --> 00:01:36,453
<i>That's what being friends is about</i>

25
00:01:37,571 --> 00:01:40,520
<i>Everyone is special in their own way</i>

26
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,537
<i>And we'll always be together as one</i>

27
00:01:42,662 --> 00:01:45,150
- What the hell are they doing?
- I have no idea.

28
00:01:46,003 --> 00:01:49,397
<i>Together we'll stay
And every kid in school is</i>

29
00:01:49,522 --> 00:01:51,573
<i>Special in their own way</i>

30
00:01:52,865 --> 00:01:54,917
Dude, girls are such fags.

31
00:01:56,734 --> 00:01:59,914
<i>Boys are special in their own way</i>

32
00:02:00,174 --> 00:02:03,209
<i>Girls are special like a birthday</i>

33
00:02:03,369 --> 00:02:06,421
<i>We'll always be dancing
And singing it loud</i>

34
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:10,669
Here he comes!

35
00:02:10,794 --> 00:02:13,787
<i>I like having fun
In the hot summer sun</i>

36
00:02:13,912 --> 00:02:16,765
<i>And grooving to the beat
When my homework is all done</i>

37
00:02:17,143 --> 00:02:18,597
<i>If you ask me what I know...</i>

38
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:21,087
- Who the hell is that?
- That's Bridon Guermo.

39
00:02:21,212 --> 00:02:24,355
He's just a third grader. But he sing
and dance better than anybody.

40
00:02:24,825 --> 00:02:27,942
He's already seen
<i>High School Musical 3</i> over 100 times!

41
00:02:28,103 --> 00:02:30,833
<i>Everyone is special in their own way</i>

42
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:33,908
<i>Special in their own way</i>

43
00:02:34,033 --> 00:02:35,976
<i>Let it out, party people</i>

44
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:39,885
Are we the only ones here
who are completely confused?

45
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:42,554
I guess we better check
that movie out.

46
00:02:44,726 --> 00:02:47,211
<i>You got to go with the status quo</i>

47
00:02:47,899 --> 00:02:50,167
<i>If you wanna be a regular joe</i>

48
00:02:50,292 --> 00:02:51,279
<i>Come on now</i>

49
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:54,155
<i>And your dreams
are only a beat away</i>

50
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,471
<i>Don't let 'em tell you no</i>

51
00:02:56,631 --> 00:02:59,891
<i>You got to go with the status quo</i>

52
00:03:00,016 --> 00:03:03,037
<i>Keep singing about the status quo</i>

53
00:03:03,162 --> 00:03:05,530
<i>That's the phrase we know</i>

54
00:03:05,655 --> 00:03:06,743
<i>Get down now</i>

55
00:03:06,868 --> 00:03:08,733
This is cool?

56
00:03:09,297 --> 00:03:11,653
<i>Singing about what we know</i>

57
00:03:12,632 --> 00:03:14,105
This is cool.

58
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:16,658
We are really getting old.

59
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:20,517
<i>We're all going with the status quo</i>

60
00:03:21,184 --> 00:03:23,231
<i>Cuz that's where we should go</i>

61
00:03:23,356 --> 00:03:26,709
It says this DVD sold more copies
than any DVD ever made.

62
00:03:27,087 --> 00:03:30,380
They just released part 3 in theaters
and it made 80 million opening weekend.

63
00:03:30,963 --> 00:03:33,516
I'm out, guys. If this is what's cool,
I think I'm done.

64
00:03:33,641 --> 00:03:35,574
I no longer have any connection
to this world.

65
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:37,384
I'm gonna go home and kill myself.

66
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:38,833
Goodbye, friends.

67
00:03:41,358 --> 00:03:43,760
I don't care how popular
being like these kids becomes.

68
00:03:43,885 --> 00:03:46,380
- I'm not doing it.
- I'm not doing it either.

69
00:03:46,505 --> 00:03:47,763
No way I'm doing it.

70
00:03:47,906 --> 00:03:48,927
Okay. We promise?

71
00:03:49,052 --> 00:03:51,110
We have to swear
we'll never become this.

72
00:03:51,235 --> 00:03:53,015
- I swear.
- I swear, too.

73
00:03:53,646 --> 00:03:54,648
Okay. Good.

74
00:04:04,715 --> 00:04:06,551
I thought you were going
to kill yourself.

75
00:04:06,676 --> 00:04:07,728
I tried.

76
00:04:07,853 --> 00:04:10,644
Went to sleep in my mom's car
in the garage with the engine turned on.

77
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:12,078
But you didn't die?

78
00:04:12,621 --> 00:04:15,848
Frickin' hybrids, man.
They just don't do the trick anymore.

79
00:04:16,925 --> 00:04:19,178
All right, kids in seats.
Kids in seats.

80
00:04:19,954 --> 00:04:22,812
Today we are going to discuss
the berlin wall.

81
00:04:22,937 --> 00:04:24,312
This was a wall in Germany

82
00:04:24,437 --> 00:04:27,985
that actually separated the communist
east side and the democratic west side.

83
00:04:29,175 --> 00:04:31,899
<i>East side west side
Whatever side that you're on</i>

84
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:34,939
<i>As long as we care about each other
We can still all have some fun</i>

85
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,996
<i>Don't sweat what you might get
By seeing the other side as a threat</i>

86
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,660
Oh, you kids!

87
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,661
<i>Neither side is right or wrong
We gotta learn to all get along</i>

88
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,495
<i>East side west side
It doesn't matter to me</i>

89
00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:51,820
<i>We gotta learn to power through
And set each other free</i>

90
00:04:52,223 --> 00:04:55,547
<i>Don't care what other people wear
Or the way they like to style their hair</i>

91
00:04:55,708 --> 00:05:00,177
<i>Neither side is right or wrong
That's why we got to get along</i>

92
00:05:00,302 --> 00:05:02,100
East side

93
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:12,462
Do you feel like maybe
you're losing her, Stan?

94
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:16,283
I don't know. There's nothing
I can do about it anyway.

95
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,826
Maybe you should just talk to her.
You know, a little conversation.

96
00:05:19,951 --> 00:05:21,871
<i>Tell her what you feel.</i>

97
00:05:22,762 --> 00:05:25,336
<i>Sometimes you feel like
there's a burning inside you</i>

98
00:05:25,461 --> 00:05:26,911
- <i>Like a...</i>
- Just stop.

99
00:05:27,409 --> 00:05:28,475
All righty then.

100
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:34,821
Look, I just want you to know,
if you want to, you know,

101
00:05:34,946 --> 00:05:37,005
be with that Bridon kid, then
you should.

102
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,005
What?

103
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,170
I see the way you two are together
and I don't wanna be in your way.

104
00:05:41,436 --> 00:05:43,086
Stan, that's ridiculous.

105
00:05:43,559 --> 00:05:45,928
- It is?
- I would never leave you for Bridon.

106
00:05:46,053 --> 00:05:48,425
- Really?
- No way! That'd be stupid!

107
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:51,636
I wouldn't have a chance with Bridon.
He can be with any girl he wants!

108
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,762
There you go.
Feel better, pal?

109
00:06:00,455 --> 00:06:01,696
What am I supposed to do?

110
00:06:01,821 --> 00:06:04,492
I can't just sit back and watch
some kid steal my girlfriend away!

111
00:06:06,427 --> 00:06:08,686
Wendy says she'd never
leave me for him,

112
00:06:08,811 --> 00:06:11,818
but what if she just doesn't
wanna hurt my feelings?

113
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,741
She said he could get
any girl he wants

114
00:06:13,866 --> 00:06:16,201
 and that means if he wanted
he could have my girl.

115
00:06:16,326 --> 00:06:20,478
This is all so crazy. I mean really,
how could my day get any worse?

116
00:06:24,243 --> 00:06:25,997
No, I'm not doing it.

117
00:06:26,615 --> 00:06:29,074
- I'm not doing it!
- Come on!

118
00:06:29,677 --> 00:06:31,492
No, fuck off.
I'm not doing it!

119
00:06:32,466 --> 00:06:33,963
- That sucks.
- Too bad.

120
00:06:34,792 --> 00:06:36,246
Jeez.
You're no fun.

121
00:06:45,975 --> 00:06:47,391
Hey, kid.
Over here.

122
00:06:48,829 --> 00:06:52,016
Listen. You know this whole singing
and dancing thing you do.

123
00:06:52,141 --> 00:06:54,513
I think you need to... ease off
a little bit.

124
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,655
Look, I know you think the kids
in the school like you,

125
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,935
but actually they're all
getting really annoyed.

126
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,406
- They are?
- You don't know

127
00:07:01,531 --> 00:07:05,413
'cuz you're a third grader. But take it
from me, you're driving everyone crazy.

128
00:07:06,622 --> 00:07:08,671
I don't blame them.
All that singing and dancing.

129
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:10,062
I can't stand it.

130
00:07:10,908 --> 00:07:13,705
- You don't like doing it?
- It just isn't me.

131
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:16,658
What I really wanna do
is just play basketball.

132
00:07:16,783 --> 00:07:18,593
- Basketball?
- I love it.

133
00:07:18,718 --> 00:07:19,655
Always have.

134
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,961
I never miss a game on TV,
when my dad isn't making me rehearse.

135
00:07:23,086 --> 00:07:26,020
I'd like to quit singing
and dancing forever and just play ball.

136
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:28,531
You should do that.
You should join the basketball team.

137
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:29,666
Right now.

138
00:07:30,155 --> 00:07:31,624
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

139
00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:33,194
What's stopping you?

140
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,887
It's my dad.

141
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:36,691
He thinks basketball is for sissies.

142
00:07:36,816 --> 00:07:38,811
If I don't do what he wants,
he beats me.

143
00:07:38,936 --> 00:07:42,118
No, dude. You need to take a stand
and tell your dad what you want.

144
00:07:42,445 --> 00:07:44,202
- Really?
- When you'll be a 4th grader,

145
00:07:44,327 --> 00:07:46,994
you'll understand that you have to be
tough and direct with your parents.

146
00:07:47,119 --> 00:07:51,166
Go and tell your dad you want to give up
singing and dancing and play basketball.

147
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:52,941
You know, you're right.

148
00:07:53,288 --> 00:07:55,273
I'm gonna talk to my old man
tonight!

149
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:56,729
Sweet.

150
00:08:00,782 --> 00:08:04,662
Sit up properly. You know how strict
your father is about posture.

151
00:08:04,856 --> 00:08:06,834
All right, dear.
Dinner's ready.

152
00:08:10,494 --> 00:08:11,744
Okay, let's eat.

153
00:08:14,566 --> 00:08:16,249
Dad, I need to talk to you.

154
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:18,239
That sounds emotional!

155
00:08:18,559 --> 00:08:20,309
<i>What is it, son what's on your mind</i>

156
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:22,886
<i>Whatever it is, you know
your dad has the time</i>

157
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,966
Can we just talk?

158
00:08:25,299 --> 00:08:27,358
<i>If you can talk it
You can sing it</i>

159
00:08:27,483 --> 00:08:29,511
<i>You can lay down the rhythm
and bring it</i>

160
00:08:29,854 --> 00:08:32,602
<i>Just put a melody to the words
that you're saying</i>

161
00:08:32,727 --> 00:08:35,816
- <i>and soon you'll be...</i>
- Dad, I wanna join the basketball team.

162
00:08:37,967 --> 00:08:39,317
What did you say?

163
00:08:39,739 --> 00:08:42,356
This kid at school today told me
I should do what I want to do.

164
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:44,091
That's what I really want to do.

165
00:08:44,572 --> 00:08:45,736
Basketball?

166
00:08:45,995 --> 00:08:48,948
No son of mine is going to be a
sweaty little jock!

167
00:08:49,824 --> 00:08:52,301
- But Dad, that's what I really want...
- There's no singing

168
00:08:52,426 --> 00:08:53,703
and dancing in basketball!

169
00:08:54,114 --> 00:08:57,437
- I know. That's kind of why I like it.
- Don't you even think about it!

170
00:08:57,562 --> 00:08:58,925
If I had a jock for a son,

171
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,294
I'd be the laughing stock
of the men's choir club!

172
00:09:01,664 --> 00:09:04,462
- It's my life, Dad!
- Don't make me slap you.

173
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:07,520
I will slap your face so super hard.

174
00:09:10,603 --> 00:09:12,164
I am the man of this house!

175
00:09:12,289 --> 00:09:14,680
You disrespect me
and you're gonna get slapped!

176
00:09:15,164 --> 00:09:18,528
- Maybe you should let him try it.
- What did you say, woman?

177
00:09:18,818 --> 00:09:20,399
You aren't being fair.

178
00:09:20,524 --> 00:09:22,659
That's it. I'm gonna slap you!

179
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:23,895
No, please!

180
00:09:24,266 --> 00:09:25,703
<i>I slap you! I slap you!</i>

181
00:09:25,828 --> 00:09:27,324
<i>I slap, slap, slap you!</i>

182
00:09:27,449 --> 00:09:30,865
<i>I'm slapping you, slapping you
silly' cuz you disrespected me</i>

183
00:09:33,117 --> 00:09:34,994
I need to copy your math homework
before class.

184
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:37,099
You're not copying my homework,
you lazy turd.

185
00:09:37,224 --> 00:09:38,492
Fuck you, Kyle.

186
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:43,506
<i>And you know
We're together at school again</i>

187
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,881
<i>With all of our friends</i>

188
00:09:46,006 --> 00:09:49,008
<i>And you know
We'll be doing this forever</i>

189
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,808
- <i>Together, at school again</i>
- Goddammit! Shut up!

190
00:09:51,933 --> 00:09:54,683
<i>What a special day
We can say that it's never</i>

191
00:09:56,299 --> 00:09:59,954
<i>That it's never going away</i>

192
00:10:05,082 --> 00:10:07,737
What happened? I thought you
didn't wanna sing and dance anymore.

193
00:10:07,862 --> 00:10:10,951
Yeah, well, my dad blew a gasket
when I told him and then he beat my mom.

194
00:10:11,087 --> 00:10:13,793
What did I tell you? You must be tough
and stand up for yourself.

195
00:10:13,918 --> 00:10:14,951
Mr. Garett!

196
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:17,828
He wants to join the basketball team.
He's good.

197
00:10:17,953 --> 00:10:18,774
Really?

198
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:21,731
- I should be getting to class.
- Hey, we sure could use you, kid.

199
00:10:21,915 --> 00:10:24,004
I can never find enough kids
that wanna play ball.

200
00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:26,869
All the kids and the school funding
goes to the theater department.

201
00:10:26,994 --> 00:10:29,536
You see? They need you.
This is fate, kid. Fate.

1
00:10:30,094 --> 00:10:30,969
I don't know.

2
00:10:31,094 --> 00:10:33,844
Look, just come in at recess
and shoot some balls with the team.

3
00:10:33,969 --> 00:10:36,760
Just go in at recess and shoot
some balls with the team, goddammit.

4
00:10:37,417 --> 00:10:38,251
Okay.

5
00:10:43,074 --> 00:10:45,438
- That's great, Bridon!
- Thanks!

6
00:10:45,563 --> 00:10:47,689
We might have a chance
at winning now!

7
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:52,734
<i>What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?</i>

8
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,656
- Dad, I was just messing around.
- I drove by the school

9
00:10:56,781 --> 00:11:00,109
and saw kids on the playground doing
a music number, and you weren't there.

10
00:11:00,234 --> 00:11:03,170
You're here in the sports gym
shooting basketball hoops.

11
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,221
Your kid is really good at this.

12
00:11:05,346 --> 00:11:07,789
Don't talk to me,
stupid jock asshole!

13
00:11:07,914 --> 00:11:09,625
Just go easy on him, huh?

14
00:11:11,316 --> 00:11:14,256
You know what this means?
It means you're about to get slapped,

15
00:11:14,381 --> 00:11:15,761
so you better shut up.

16
00:11:15,886 --> 00:11:18,363
If he wants to play ball,
you should let him.

17
00:11:18,488 --> 00:11:20,913
I'll do it!
I'll slap the outta you!

18
00:11:21,038 --> 00:11:22,604
He's just a kid.

19
00:11:23,027 --> 00:11:24,879
You don't tell me
how to raise my son!

20
00:11:25,004 --> 00:11:27,070
- I'll slap it again...
- Dad, stop!

21
00:11:27,195 --> 00:11:30,637
You trying to turn my son into a little
asshole sports person like yourself?

22
00:11:30,762 --> 00:11:33,802
There. There's another slap.
Maybe you'll think next time you act you

23
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:35,418
slap it! I slap it!

24
00:11:36,573 --> 00:11:39,407
- Dad! Dad, you're hurting me!
- Shut up, Bridon!

25
00:11:40,447 --> 00:11:42,619
What's going on here, Mr. Guermo?

26
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:45,483
Get outta my way, Mackey!
You wanna piece of this?

27
00:11:47,448 --> 00:11:50,559
I'll slap everyone
in this goddamn school if I have to!

28
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:56,060
You are never going to play
shooty hoops, do you understand?

29
00:11:56,185 --> 00:11:58,561
You're gonna sing and dance
and be the best at it.

30
00:11:58,686 --> 00:12:00,836
- You're hurting my arm!
- That's good.

31
00:12:01,363 --> 00:12:02,408
Oh, shit!

32
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,610
That's good.
Yeah, shoot that guy in the face.

33
00:12:08,062 --> 00:12:09,062
Yeah, nice.

34
00:12:11,187 --> 00:12:14,252
You guys, this <i>High School Musical</i>
thing isn't gonna go away.

35
00:12:14,377 --> 00:12:16,313
I think we better just get
on board with it.

36
00:12:16,438 --> 00:12:17,881
What? Are you crazy?

37
00:12:18,006 --> 00:12:18,980
No way, dude.

38
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:21,823
We promised each other
we would never do that. Remember?

39
00:12:21,948 --> 00:12:25,558
I know, but I think we're really
starting to become outcasts at school.

40
00:12:25,683 --> 00:12:27,255
We're losing all our credibility.

41
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,603
I mean, look at who you guys
are hanging out with now.

42
00:12:29,728 --> 00:12:31,541
Scott Malkinson for Christ's sake!

43
00:12:33,788 --> 00:12:35,737
What so bad about
hanging out with me?

44
00:12:36,031 --> 00:12:37,262
Shut up.

45
00:12:37,387 --> 00:12:40,341
"I'm Scott Malkinson.
I've got a lisp and ig got diabetes."

46
00:12:40,466 --> 00:12:41,885
Don't make fun of my diabetes.

47
00:12:42,281 --> 00:12:44,726
"Don't make fun of my diabetes.
I'm Scott Malkinson."

48
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,459
You can rip on him,
but you guys are hanging out with him.

49
00:12:48,584 --> 00:12:50,947
Don't you think maybe your clout
at school has slipped a little?

50
00:12:51,072 --> 00:12:53,889
You're jealous of that third grader
and you think Wendy's gonna go for him

51
00:12:54,014 --> 00:12:56,123
unless you start singing
and dancing, too.

52
00:12:56,635 --> 00:12:57,855
That isn't true!

53
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:00,928
Okay, that's totally true.

54
00:13:01,053 --> 00:13:03,836
But you guys, we are at risk
of becoming the unpopular kids.

55
00:13:04,254 --> 00:13:06,019
That was supposed to be
my power up pack.

56
00:13:06,144 --> 00:13:09,246
"It was supposed to be my power up pack.
I'm Scott Malkinson. I have diabetes."

57
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:15,012
High School Musical <i>is so awesome.</i>

58
00:13:21,556 --> 00:13:23,760
- Mr. Guermo?
- What?

59
00:13:24,196 --> 00:13:25,996
We're from child protective services.

60
00:13:26,121 --> 00:13:28,807
There's some concern you might be
physically abusing your child.

61
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,435
What?
Who the hell's been saying that?

62
00:13:31,888 --> 00:13:35,811
We got a phone call from a concerned
student who wishes to remain anonymous.

63
00:13:35,936 --> 00:13:37,399
His name is Stan Marsh.

64
00:13:37,748 --> 00:13:41,041
You better just turn your asses around
and get back in your little car,

65
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,733
'cuz there's a world of hurt about
to come your way.

66
00:13:43,858 --> 00:13:47,015
Mr. Guermo, we need to come in
and have a word with your son.

67
00:13:47,265 --> 00:13:48,602
Oh, by all means.

68
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:51,102
You got the balls
to come in here, do it.

69
00:13:51,894 --> 00:13:52,786
Do it!

70
00:13:55,185 --> 00:13:57,255
Hello, Bridon. My name is Mr. Kelly.

71
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,604
We just wanted to talk to you
for a few minutes,

72
00:13:59,729 --> 00:14:01,670
if that's okay. And just maybe...

73
00:14:02,385 --> 00:14:05,850
There it is! Slapped you!
You probably think I'm finished, huh?

74
00:14:06,219 --> 00:14:08,457
- There's another one!
- Oh, my God!

75
00:14:08,582 --> 00:14:10,879
Don't worry, bitch.
I didn't forget about you!

76
00:14:11,102 --> 00:14:13,617
There's a slap for you!
Slap! Slap! Slap!

77
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:17,971
There you go! Here's a little
reach-around back of the head slap!

78
00:14:18,096 --> 00:14:21,231
Oh, God, please! You have to get away.
He won't ever stop!

79
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,278
I'm going slap happy!

80
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:26,275
<i>I'm going slap, slap happy.
Slap-ati, slap.</i>

81
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,027
<i>And teaching you a lesson
for coming in my house!</i>

82
00:14:30,082 --> 00:14:32,113
What are you looking at, Robertson?

83
00:14:40,065 --> 00:14:43,041
They're here. The audition results
for the school musical are in!

84
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,962
- You got the lead, Wendy!
- All right!

85
00:14:49,244 --> 00:14:51,056
- Who's the male lead?
- No surprise there!

86
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,994
- It's Bridon!
- All right.

87
00:14:54,591 --> 00:14:56,130
I get to be a stand-in!

88
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:00,698
Congratulations, Bridon!
Guess we'll be working a lot together.

89
00:15:00,956 --> 00:15:02,964
- Yeah, great.
- Goddammit!

90
00:15:04,623 --> 00:15:07,019
No matter what I do,
this kid just won't stop.

91
00:15:09,078 --> 00:15:12,347
Now they're gonna be in a show
together? Jesus, it's all for me!

92
00:15:12,734 --> 00:15:14,820
They'll probably even have
a kissing scene!

93
00:15:14,945 --> 00:15:18,046
What did I do to deserve this?
And what am I supposed to do now?

94
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:28,635
<i>Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah</i>

95
00:15:28,898 --> 00:15:31,179
<i>Someone's in the kitchen, I know</i>

96
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:33,139
<i>Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah</i>

97
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:35,863
<i>Strumming on the old banjo
and going...</i>

98
00:15:41,438 --> 00:15:44,465
<i>Strumming on the ol'banjo, jo, jo </i>

99
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,401
<i>Go tell aunt Rhodie</i>

100
00:15:46,526 --> 00:15:48,384
<i>Go tell aunt Rhodie</i>

101
00:15:48,509 --> 00:15:52,068
<i>Go tell aunt Rhodie
The old Grey Goose is...</i>

102
00:15:53,602 --> 00:15:56,412
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

103
00:15:56,537 --> 00:15:58,868
<i>Happy birthday to...</i>

104
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:09,342
<i>Hear the rhythm?
Now is the time! The time!</i>

105
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,420
<i>It's time to go to bed!</i>

106
00:16:11,545 --> 00:16:13,610
<i>Yes, time to call it a day!</i>

107
00:16:13,735 --> 00:16:17,034
- <i>You the reach the stars...</i>
- Please! You have to do something!

108
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:18,829
What are you interrupting me for?

109
00:16:18,954 --> 00:16:21,855
- It's our son. He's running away.
- What?

110
00:16:23,678 --> 00:16:26,160
<i>What's going on here?
What's this all about?</i>

111
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,697
<i>What do you think you're doing?</i>

112
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,740
- {\Dad, }I'm sick of you trying to always...
- Sing it!

113
00:16:32,169 --> 00:16:33,575
I'm sick of singing!

114
00:16:33,884 --> 00:16:35,969
<i>Can you believe it?
What'd he just say?</i>

115
00:16:36,094 --> 00:16:38,665
<i>What's the matter
with kids these days?</i>

116
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:42,496
<i>Kids these days.</i>

117
00:16:42,621 --> 00:16:44,210
<i>Kids these days!</i>

118
00:16:46,148 --> 00:16:48,960
Just go right back to your room
and sing a ballad, mister!

119
00:16:49,236 --> 00:16:50,399
Just let me go.

120
00:16:50,655 --> 00:16:51,655
Go ahead.

121
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,062
Make my day.

122
00:16:53,809 --> 00:16:55,571
You get upstairs

123
00:16:55,873 --> 00:16:57,606
or I will slap you

124
00:16:57,731 --> 00:16:59,984
until there's little red hand prints

125
00:17:00,109 --> 00:17:02,196
all over your face.

126
00:17:04,528 --> 00:17:06,301
Oh, my God, what was that?

127
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:10,041
Did you see that?
Oh, my God. It hurt so bad!

128
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,552
What the "h" is going on?

129
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:28,535
- I had to see it to believe it.
- I told you guys.

130
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,201
He's been watching <i>High School Musical</i>
over and over again.

131
00:17:31,326 --> 00:17:34,047
Actually, this is <i>High School Musical 2</i>.
It has a dance-along part.

132
00:17:34,172 --> 00:17:36,725
We said we wouldn't a part
of this fad and look at you.

133
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:38,223
Look at yourself, man!

134
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,137
{\Look, }You guys might be fine
with being outcasts

135
00:17:40,262 --> 00:17:42,227
and hanging out with Scott Malkinson,
but I'm not.

136
00:17:42,554 --> 00:17:45,415
You know what? At least Scott Malkinson
has some self-respect!

137
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,733
At least Scott doesn't cave in to peer
pressure and start doing musicals!

138
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:52,112
Scott Malkinson has a lisp and diabetes!
Nobody's going to let him do a musical!

139
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,019
That's enough, you guys.
It's not cool.

140
00:17:54,144 --> 00:17:56,164
Lots of kids have diabetes,
and you shouldn't be...

141
00:17:56,289 --> 00:17:59,274
"You shouldn't rip on kids with diabetes.
That's not cool. I'm Scott Malkinson."

142
00:17:59,399 --> 00:18:01,996
Look, guys, the world is changing.

143
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:04,825
We can't fight it.
We have to change with it.

144
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,138
I've been watching these movies
and from the looks of it,

145
00:18:07,263 --> 00:18:10,171
there's going to be a lot more singing
and dancing when we get to high school.

146
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:13,117
And if you think we'll gain
any respect by ignoring this thing

147
00:18:13,242 --> 00:18:15,854
and being individuals
then think about this...

148
00:18:16,623 --> 00:18:21,141
Right now, everyone thinks
Butters is way cooler than any of you.

149
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,270
That's a low blow, Stan.

150
00:18:31,624 --> 00:18:35,864
Third team foul on West Jeff Bobcats.
Ball goes back over to the cows.

151
00:18:36,296 --> 00:18:38,880
All right.
You ready to get in there, Bridon?

152
00:18:39,496 --> 00:18:41,828
- I'm ready, coach.
- Give 'em hell!

153
00:18:48,756 --> 00:18:50,837
Just a second to go
in the first quarter.

154
00:19:27,639 --> 00:19:30,363
How come you weren't
at musical rehearsals last night?

155
00:19:30,488 --> 00:19:31,873
I joined the basketball team.

156
00:19:31,998 --> 00:19:34,373
I gave up singing and dancing forever.
I'm just not into it.

157
00:19:34,498 --> 00:19:36,323
- You gave it up?
- That's right.

158
00:19:36,448 --> 00:19:39,677
You know, sometimes you just have to go
with what your heart tells you.

159
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:43,064
There's things we're all good at.
We can't keep them bottled up inside.

160
00:19:43,189 --> 00:19:46,572
<i>'cuz you got to do
what you wanna do.</i>

161
00:19:47,211 --> 00:19:51,033
<i>Don't let nothing get in your way
Chase your dream every day.</i>

162
00:19:51,158 --> 00:19:53,891
<i>True, girl, you know it's true</i>

163
00:19:54,016 --> 00:19:58,947
<i>That if you really wanna be you
You gotta do what you wanna do.</i>

164
00:20:00,077 --> 00:20:03,208
<i>He was unhappy
'cuz he just wanted to play ball</i>

165
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:06,913
<i>But he finally got the courage
to answer his call.</i>

166
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:10,541
<i>Just like me all I every wanted
was to sing and dance</i>

167
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:13,591
<i>And now that I stood up for my dream
I finally have the chance</i>

168
00:20:13,716 --> 00:20:17,026
<i>you gotta do what you wanna do</i>

169
00:20:17,878 --> 00:20:20,885
<i>Even if other people
don't really want you to</i>

170
00:20:21,383 --> 00:20:24,138
<i>True, girl, you know it's true</i>

171
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:29,060
<i>That the thing you wanna do
is the thing that you should do</i>

172
00:20:30,293 --> 00:20:33,787
<i>Some kids think I'm strange
'cuz I enjoy studying for exams</i>

173
00:20:33,912 --> 00:20:37,068
<i>But I don't let that bother me
because it's who I am</i>

174
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:40,742
<i>And I like nothing better
than making fun of yous</i>

175
00:20:40,867 --> 00:20:44,462
<i>And ripping on black people though some
people think it's rude but you gotta</i>

176
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:47,290
<i>Do what you wanna do</i>

177
00:20:48,332 --> 00:20:51,956
<i>Just make sure that what you're doing
is what's cool and popular with everyone</i>

178
00:20:52,081 --> 00:20:54,377
<i>Chew, baby chew and chew...</i>

179
00:20:55,924 --> 00:20:58,930
- Can we watch you practice basketball?
- Sure.

180
00:21:00,656 --> 00:21:02,276
<i>Do what you want
don't have restraint</i>

181
00:21:02,401 --> 00:21:04,225
<i>Don't stress about it
or you just might faint</i>

182
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,176
<i>if you wanna get high
and jack off, it's cool</i>

183
00:21:06,301 --> 00:21:10,655
<i>- You gotta do what you wanna do.
- Do what you wanna do</i>

184
00:21:11,265 --> 00:21:14,867
<i>as long as what you wanna do
is what everybody wants you to</i>

185
00:21:14,992 --> 00:21:17,814
<i>Glue, baby buy some Glue !</i>

186
00:21:17,939 --> 00:21:20,983
- <i>Just in case you what you do with...</i>
- Hey, guys.

187
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,999
- Where'd everybody go?
- The girls all wanted to go watch

188
00:21:30,124 --> 00:21:32,211
that Bridon kid practice basketball.

189
00:21:32,693 --> 00:21:34,877
But the girls like singing
and dancing.

190
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:37,392
I think the girl just like
that Bridon kid.

191
00:21:37,517 --> 00:21:38,904
No matter what he does.

192
00:21:39,837 --> 00:21:41,215
But... No, we just...

193
00:21:42,086 --> 00:21:43,824
No, wait! We just got good...
