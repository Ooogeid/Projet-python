{\YOU ARE NOT MEANT TO SEE}

4
00:00:36,324 --> 00:00:39,626
- What's going on, dad?
- You have to move. It isn't...

5
00:00:50,021 --> 00:00:51,325
I'm so...

6
00:00:51,888 --> 00:00:52,980
startled.

7
00:00:55,301 --> 00:00:56,766
{\PANDEMIC 2}

00:00:56,886 --> 00:00:59,688
{\THE STARTLING}

9
00:01:03,113 --> 00:01:04,827
My name is Craig Tucker.

10
00:01:05,476 --> 00:01:07,214
Last week was my birthday.

11
00:01:07,963 --> 00:01:10,220
My grandma gave me a check for $100.

12
00:01:10,466 --> 00:01:11,910
I was so happy.

13
00:01:13,084 --> 00:01:16,009
But then, four kids from school
came to my house

14
00:01:16,129 --> 00:01:18,628
and said I should use my $100

15
00:01:18,748 --> 00:01:20,324
to invest in becoming

16
00:01:20,617 --> 00:01:22,472
a Peruvian flute band.

17
00:01:22,592 --> 00:01:25,390
They promised I would double
my money in one afternoon.

18
00:01:25,623 --> 00:01:29,295
But the government arrested us, along
with {\all}the other Peruvian flute bands,

19
00:01:29,415 --> 00:01:31,974
and took us
to an internment camp in Miami.

20
00:01:32,094 --> 00:01:33,819
We begged to go home. But instead,

21
00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:36,774
the government told us
they were sending us to Peru.

22
00:01:39,798 --> 00:01:42,668
And so that is why I am now in Peru.

23
00:01:43,017 --> 00:01:46,119
If I die, let it be known
that it is because four guys

24
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,147
I don't even like from school
lied to me and took my birthday money.

25
00:01:50,417 --> 00:01:52,507
We didn't lie!
It was a sweet idea!

26
00:01:52,627 --> 00:01:55,785
How were we supposed to know
that pan flute bands would be outlawed?

27
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:58,829
I don't get it. They said
the military would meet us here.

28
00:01:58,949 --> 00:02:00,639
This is where they told us to land.

29
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:02,792
- Can't you get through to Washington?
- I'm trying.

30
00:02:02,952 --> 00:02:04,799
<i>This is Conner in Washington!</i>

31
00:02:04,919 --> 00:02:08,518
The place that homeland security
told us to start the operation,

32
00:02:08,638 --> 00:02:12,009
there's nobody here to meet us.
It's like they sent us to no man's land.

33
00:02:12,308 --> 00:02:13,987
<i>Jesus, they're everywhere!</i>

34
00:02:14,246 --> 00:02:15,619
What are everywhere?

35
00:02:16,334 --> 00:02:17,599
<i>So furry!</i>

36
00:02:18,301 --> 00:02:19,556
<i>They're attacking</i>

37
00:02:19,676 --> 00:02:20,769
<i>every city.</i>

38
00:02:21,621 --> 00:02:22,983
<i>People dying!</i>

39
00:02:25,058 --> 00:02:26,084
<i>Guinea pigs,</i>

40
00:02:26,366 --> 00:02:27,484
<i>all over!</i>

41
00:02:28,276 --> 00:02:30,636
- Guinea pigs?
- <i>Can't stop them.</i>

42
00:02:31,498 --> 00:02:33,130
<i>Need to get out.</i>

43
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,474
<i>I just ate...</i>

44
00:02:36,694 --> 00:02:37,704
<i>a peanut.</i>

45
00:02:38,303 --> 00:02:39,676
<i>Peanut now stuck</i>

46
00:02:40,241 --> 00:02:41,251
<i>in throat.</i>

47
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,918
<i>I shouldn't eat peanuts</i>

48
00:02:44,294 --> 00:02:45,405
<i>when scared.</i>

49
00:02:52,447 --> 00:02:55,066
I've got the video camera.
Got it turned on again.

50
00:02:56,506 --> 00:02:58,064
This is Randy Marsh.

51
00:02:58,665 --> 00:03:00,618
I'm shooting the video of myself.

52
00:03:00,946 --> 00:03:02,456
20 minutes ago, some

53
00:03:02,576 --> 00:03:04,422
huge creatures attacked our town.

54
00:03:04,542 --> 00:03:06,146
It's still chaos out the window.

55
00:03:09,718 --> 00:03:11,550
I barely made it back to the house.

56
00:03:12,284 --> 00:03:13,810
Sharon is here with me.

57
00:03:14,184 --> 00:03:16,477
And there's Shelley.
Wave to the camera.

58
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:19,497
Will you put down the camera.
We need to figure out what to do!

59
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:21,496
I don't know what to do.
I'm so startled.

60
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:23,897
We have to see
what the news is saying.

61
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:29,223
<i>This is a shot of New York City
where the giant guinea pigs</i>

62
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:31,580
- <i>have also attacked.</i>
- Guinea pigs?

63
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,050
<i>Reports of attacks are coming
in from major cities all over the world.</i>

64
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,091
Jesus, this thing is worldwide!

65
00:03:42,297 --> 00:03:43,718
Look at that thing!

66
00:03:44,983 --> 00:03:46,479
What are we gonna do?

67
00:03:51,653 --> 00:03:54,553
- Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
- Go! Run!

68
00:03:55,189 --> 00:03:56,197
We gotta get out!

69
00:03:58,358 --> 00:04:00,119
Michels? Harrison?
Anybody?

70
00:04:01,313 --> 00:04:04,222
Nothing.
Lsat is down, and no answer at RCU.

71
00:04:04,342 --> 00:04:06,479
Whatever is going on out there,
it's huge.

72
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,272
All right, {\just}let me get this straight.

73
00:04:08,392 --> 00:04:11,028
The head of homeland security
ordered you to fly us,

74
00:04:11,148 --> 00:04:12,871
five kids, to Peru,

75
00:04:13,095 --> 00:04:15,420
but had you land way up
in the Andes mountains of Peru

76
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,076
so that other government
people could meet us and then

77
00:04:18,196 --> 00:04:21,592
somehow tell us how to go
to the capital of Peru way over in Lima

78
00:04:21,712 --> 00:04:23,396
and take down their government?

79
00:04:24,454 --> 00:04:25,804
That was the order.

80
00:04:27,013 --> 00:04:28,371
That makes sense to you?

81
00:04:28,715 --> 00:04:29,971
Nope, not at all.

82
00:04:30,386 --> 00:04:32,721
Actually, the whole rounding up
of the pan flute bands

83
00:04:32,841 --> 00:04:34,594
didn't make sense
to any of us either.

84
00:04:34,714 --> 00:04:37,008
None of what that homeland security
guy does make sense!

85
00:04:37,128 --> 00:04:39,116
So, could you just fly us home,
please?

86
00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:40,921
You don't understand.

87
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:43,680
The plan was to have
a refueling truck meet us here.

88
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,788
We don't have enough gas
to fly anyplace.

89
00:04:46,521 --> 00:04:47,730
That's awesome.

90
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:50,574
So, we've got to find
another way out of here.

91
00:04:50,694 --> 00:04:52,587
It's starting to look that way.

92
00:04:56,775 --> 00:04:57,832
This is fun.

93
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:00,579
Let's walk for miles through
a spooky jungle.

94
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:02,858
It just keeps getting
better and better.

95
00:05:02,978 --> 00:05:05,079
{\You know,}We're getting pretty sick
of your attitude.

96
00:05:05,757 --> 00:05:08,328
Nobody likes hanging out
with people who complain all the time.

97
00:05:08,858 --> 00:05:10,966
Look at that, no lights on, nothing.

98
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:14,314
It's like humans have never been
to this part of Peru.

99
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:31,124
More guinea pigs seem to be moving
in from all directions.

100
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,838
We checked on wikipedia,

101
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:36,756
and found out that guinea pigs are
from the Andes mountains. Here.

102
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:40,645
What about the pan flute bands?
Are they on their way to Guantanamo bay?

103
00:05:42,213 --> 00:05:46,140
Sir, we believe we have bigger problems
right now than pan flute bands.

104
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,600
Have they been loaded on
to the boats or not?

105
00:05:49,022 --> 00:05:51,578
No, sir.
We diverted all the resources away

106
00:05:51,698 --> 00:05:54,107
from the pan flute bands
to deal with the guinea pigs.

107
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:55,954
That was an order!

108
00:05:56,074 --> 00:05:59,248
The flute bands were to be put
on boats to Guantanamo last night!

109
00:05:59,368 --> 00:06:00,837
I am still in charge here!

110
00:06:00,957 --> 00:06:04,033
I want those pan flute bands
on the boats to Guantanamo!

111
00:06:05,021 --> 00:06:06,030
Yes, sir.

112
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:09,060
I don't see why you have
to yell at people.

113
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,552
Darling, main street...

114
00:06:14,369 --> 00:06:15,378
Look at that.

115
00:06:18,524 --> 00:06:21,259
- Where do we go?
- We've got to get out of town.

116
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:22,762
Go through that way.

117
00:06:26,456 --> 00:06:27,973
My arm! My arm!

118
00:06:28,564 --> 00:06:30,337
- Jesus!
- Randy, run!

119
00:06:30,761 --> 00:06:31,769
Run!

120
00:06:33,556 --> 00:06:35,064
We're running now!

121
00:06:36,353 --> 00:06:39,147
There's Sharon and Shelley running.
Wave to the camera.

122
00:06:39,267 --> 00:06:40,267
Dad!

123
00:06:45,151 --> 00:06:46,490
In there! In there!

124
00:06:50,907 --> 00:06:52,675
Oh, god. I'm so startled.

125
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:55,126
- Are you startled?
- Put down the...

126
00:06:58,467 --> 00:07:00,075
It's gonna kill us!

127
00:07:01,064 --> 00:07:03,384
Just stay down.
It can't come in here.

128
00:07:05,504 --> 00:07:07,935
Hold on. I need to get
a shot of it from outside...

129
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,183
Where are you going?

130
00:07:14,205 --> 00:07:16,507
Here we see a view
from outside the bus.

131
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,996
What the hell are you doing?

132
00:07:24,281 --> 00:07:25,907
I got a really good shot of it.

133
00:07:31,145 --> 00:07:32,371
I don't know, Lemski.

134
00:07:32,491 --> 00:07:35,284
This entire area of Peru
isn't even charted on the maps.

135
00:07:35,868 --> 00:07:39,295
This whole valley is strange.
Just look at the size of that fruit!

136
00:07:40,895 --> 00:07:42,064
Ain't that a peach?

137
00:07:43,093 --> 00:07:44,993
And how do you like them apples?

138
00:07:49,372 --> 00:07:50,742
Take a look at this!

139
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:53,678
They look like

140
00:07:53,957 --> 00:07:55,393
beehive combs.

141
00:07:56,104 --> 00:07:57,273
Oh, my God.

142
00:08:00,268 --> 00:08:03,696
- Dude, what is this place?
- It's like an unknown valley

143
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,739
that time forgot where
everything grows huge.

144
00:08:07,646 --> 00:08:08,739
That's a shock.

145
00:08:08,859 --> 00:08:10,642
I decided to follow you guys

146
00:08:10,762 --> 00:08:13,182
and now I'm in land
of the giants lost world.

147
00:08:13,711 --> 00:08:17,384
It isn't our fault! You say that we
always want to be in those situations,

148
00:08:17,504 --> 00:08:19,919
- but we don't have any choice!
- Stuff just happens.

149
00:08:20,738 --> 00:08:23,256
- Stuff just happens.
- That's right!

150
00:08:23,863 --> 00:08:26,036
You just wind up being sent
by the government

151
00:08:26,156 --> 00:08:30,145
to take down the city of Lima to wind up
in land of the giants lost world.

152
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:32,306
That's right.

153
00:08:32,891 --> 00:08:35,215
You know what stuff happens
to most kids?

154
00:08:35,335 --> 00:08:36,895
They fall off their bikes.

155
00:08:37,015 --> 00:08:39,093
They get in fights with their
parents.

156
00:08:39,213 --> 00:08:41,275
They get swindled out of their
birthday money.

157
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:44,539
Look, wherever we are, I
think we better keep moving.

158
00:08:46,074 --> 00:08:47,225
Dude, look out!

159
00:08:56,998 --> 00:08:58,559
All right. All right.

160
00:08:59,118 --> 00:09:01,445
Here's Sharon and Shelley on the
roof of Best Buy.

161
00:09:01,565 --> 00:09:03,830
We ran up here
to get off the streets.

162
00:09:04,402 --> 00:09:07,017
We found the Stotch family
hiding out up here also.

163
00:09:07,137 --> 00:09:09,874
There's Chris, Linda,
and their son Butters.

164
00:09:10,184 --> 00:09:11,189
Hello.

165
00:09:13,472 --> 00:09:15,700
What is that?
Chris, what is that?

166
00:09:16,065 --> 00:09:17,764
That's a new sound.

167
00:09:18,727 --> 00:09:19,897
Oh, God.
Look!

168
00:09:20,202 --> 00:09:22,815
- Those aren't guinea pigs.
- Get off the roof!

169
00:09:27,855 --> 00:09:29,164
Go down the stairs now.

170
00:09:29,284 --> 00:09:30,818
Get down the stairs.

171
00:09:31,924 --> 00:09:34,771
<i>And we are now getting word
of giant bees.</i>

172
00:09:35,052 --> 00:09:37,810
<i>The giant bees have been seen
in the U.S. and Europe.</i>

173
00:09:40,201 --> 00:09:42,043
Get away.
There's bees everywhere!

174
00:09:49,004 --> 00:09:50,757
There's another one right there!

175
00:09:52,734 --> 00:09:53,759
Oh, my God!

176
00:10:03,889 --> 00:10:06,451
It stung me! It stung me!

177
00:10:11,584 --> 00:10:13,064
Oh, that startled me!

178
00:10:13,184 --> 00:10:14,742
That was really startling!

179
00:10:17,072 --> 00:10:19,617
I think we're just heading
deeper into the mountains.

180
00:10:19,909 --> 00:10:21,886
Yeah, maybe we should start
heading that way.

181
00:10:22,006 --> 00:10:23,252
I think we're.

182
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,253
Hey, look at this.

183
00:10:30,485 --> 00:10:31,618
What is it?

184
00:10:31,818 --> 00:10:33,678
I don't know.
Looks old.

185
00:10:34,228 --> 00:10:35,580
Let's see what's in there.

186
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,174
Let's see what's in there.

187
00:10:37,801 --> 00:10:40,078
That's why you guys get into
these situations.

188
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:44,297
Because when you come across a
spooky ancient ruin you say

189
00:10:44,753 --> 00:10:46,190
"let's see what's in there."

190
00:10:47,553 --> 00:10:50,311
- It might be a way out, Craig!
- Yeah, Mr. Complainy Pants.

191
00:10:56,224 --> 00:10:58,781
I don't think anybody's been in
here for centuries.

192
00:10:59,658 --> 00:11:01,046
Yeah, centuries.

193
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,060
You guys look at this!

194
00:11:04,473 --> 00:11:06,043
It's a wall of ancient drawings.

195
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,165
Dude, it's a Peruvian flute band.

196
00:11:09,285 --> 00:11:10,624
I know! And look.

197
00:11:11,187 --> 00:11:15,003
Looks like the pan flute music
is driving away giant guinea pigs?

198
00:11:15,798 --> 00:11:17,414
Oh, no way! Look!

199
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,686
The pan flute bands put in prison.

200
00:11:19,806 --> 00:11:21,532
Just like what happened!

201
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:25,072
And then the guinea pigs
killing people. And then...

202
00:11:30,245 --> 00:11:31,505
Dude, it's Craig!

203
00:11:32,001 --> 00:11:32,737
What?

204
00:11:33,487 --> 00:11:34,613
That is Craig!

205
00:11:41,572 --> 00:11:44,431
- Dude, Craig, what's going on?
- I have no idea.

206
00:11:44,832 --> 00:11:48,044
Do you mind telling us what you're doing
on an ancient Inca wall, Craig?

207
00:11:48,966 --> 00:11:50,135
I don't know.

208
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:54,386
There is now word of huge
beehives forming in cities

209
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:55,801
across the U.S. and Canada.

210
00:11:55,961 --> 00:12:00,431
Europe and China are reporting deaths
by guinea pigs in the tens of thousands.

211
00:12:01,009 --> 00:12:03,476
And how are the efforts to
contain all this going?

212
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,039
It's bad, sir.

213
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:09,205
It seems we have no way of stopping it.
We've lost complete control.

214
00:12:13,913 --> 00:12:14,740
Sir?

215
00:12:15,439 --> 00:12:17,515
I'm sorry.
I just thought of a funny joke.

216
00:12:19,652 --> 00:12:22,495
All right. Get the jets ready.
I need to get to Machu Picchu.

217
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,455
Machu Picchu, sir?

218
00:12:24,713 --> 00:12:27,541
Yes. I need to be taken to Machu Picchu.
Have you lost your hearing?

219
00:12:28,151 --> 00:12:30,836
But sir, what could possibly
be at Machu Picchu to help...

220
00:12:30,996 --> 00:12:32,588
Am I in charge or not?

221
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,214
We're in the grocery store now.
Some other survivors here.

222
00:12:41,175 --> 00:12:42,763
Can we get through the highway?

223
00:12:42,883 --> 00:12:45,393
The highway's unreachable.
There's guinea rats all over it.

224
00:12:45,594 --> 00:12:46,706
Guinea rats?

225
00:12:47,418 --> 00:12:49,146
What do you mean guinea rats?

226
00:12:49,683 --> 00:12:52,819
There are guinea pigs, but there's also
guinea bees, and guinea rats.

227
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,296
I've even seen guinea spiders
out there.

228
00:12:55,652 --> 00:12:57,397
Randy, will you stop doing that?

229
00:13:00,222 --> 00:13:02,761
Look, I think we need to find
a way out under the city.

230
00:13:02,881 --> 00:13:05,287
In the sewers?
It can't be safe down there.

231
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,238
Oh, God.
What are we going to do?

232
00:13:10,976 --> 00:13:12,461
Something's inside the store!

233
00:13:14,033 --> 00:13:16,105
Guinea rabbits!
There, inside!

234
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:22,638
They're everywhere!

235
00:13:23,174 --> 00:13:23,973
Help me!

236
00:13:29,602 --> 00:13:30,896
You can't help him.

237
00:13:32,137 --> 00:13:33,691
There's something over there!

238
00:13:34,337 --> 00:13:35,939
It's a guinea bear!

239
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:37,835
No, it's a guinea mouse, stupid!

240
00:13:40,815 --> 00:13:41,615
Kill me!

241
00:13:41,775 --> 00:13:44,185
Randy, the storeroom!
We've got to get to the storeroom!

242
00:13:52,052 --> 00:13:53,479
Mom, I can't see!

243
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:56,440
It's okay, Shelley. Daddy's gonna
turn on the night vision.

244
00:13:57,187 --> 00:13:58,519
There, there.

245
00:14:02,314 --> 00:14:05,204
- What? What?
- Nothing. I just startled myself.

246
00:14:11,201 --> 00:14:13,001
Let's head over this way, guys.

247
00:14:13,656 --> 00:14:15,532
You hear that?
It sounds like water.

248
00:14:15,652 --> 00:14:17,151
Yeah, it's coming from up there.

249
00:14:28,197 --> 00:14:30,393
- Dude, that's awesome.
- All right. Let's go.

250
00:14:32,602 --> 00:14:33,751
What do you mean no?

251
00:14:34,569 --> 00:14:36,709
I'm not following you guys anymore.

252
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:39,507
We have to go check this out.

253
00:14:40,257 --> 00:14:41,094
Why?

254
00:14:42,783 --> 00:14:44,762
Because that's just the way it is.

255
00:14:45,325 --> 00:14:46,833
Every time bad things happen,

256
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:50,447
you guys end up putting yourselves
deeper into the middle of it, because

257
00:14:50,567 --> 00:14:52,436
"that's just the way it is."

258
00:14:53,243 --> 00:14:56,315
We aren't the ones on an ancient temple
prophecy wall, butt-wipe!

259
00:14:57,087 --> 00:14:58,234
I don't care.

260
00:14:58,354 --> 00:15:00,001
I've decided that I'm done.

261
00:15:00,286 --> 00:15:02,863
I am choosing not to be a part
of this anymore.

262
00:15:03,997 --> 00:15:05,241
How do you do that?

263
00:15:05,644 --> 00:15:06,951
It's easy. Watch.

264
00:15:17,378 --> 00:15:19,017
Craig, dude, wait up.

265
00:15:23,025 --> 00:15:24,828
Dude, Craig, we should go back now.

266
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,761
Hey, look! There's something here!

267
00:15:32,013 --> 00:15:32,919
Nope.

268
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:40,873
Dude, this is boring.
This is just a bunch of walking around.

269
00:15:42,367 --> 00:15:43,516
Nice and boring.

270
00:15:43,636 --> 00:15:45,062
Just the way I like it.

271
00:15:48,495 --> 00:15:52,485
It's been 3 days now since the guinea
pigs and the guinea bees attacked.

272
00:15:52,605 --> 00:15:54,224
Guinea rabbits are still everywhere.

273
00:15:54,344 --> 00:15:56,609
Along with a few guinea panthers.

274
00:15:56,729 --> 00:15:59,188
We've taken shelter
at the outback steakhouse.

275
00:15:59,308 --> 00:16:00,717
There's Sharon and Shelley.

276
00:16:00,837 --> 00:16:02,167
Say hey, guys.

277
00:16:04,407 --> 00:16:06,192
What is that?
What is that?

278
00:16:06,619 --> 00:16:08,380
I'm going to take a look outside.

279
00:16:08,621 --> 00:16:11,306
- What is it?
- It's a guinea saurus rex.

280
00:16:19,582 --> 00:16:20,629
Oh, my God!

281
00:16:20,749 --> 00:16:22,081
I'm way too startled!

282
00:16:22,358 --> 00:16:23,226
Look!

283
00:16:28,852 --> 00:16:30,349
Jesus, they can't kill it.

284
00:16:32,217 --> 00:16:34,536
What do you think about the
guinea saurus rex, Shelley?

285
00:16:37,513 --> 00:16:38,426
That's good.

286
00:16:38,546 --> 00:16:41,767
There's Shelley with the guinea
saurus rex in the background!

287
00:16:41,887 --> 00:16:44,176
Give a little peace sign, Shelley.
Oh, I know!

288
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:47,331
Hold out your palm so it looks like
you're holding the guinea saurus rex!

289
00:16:49,943 --> 00:16:51,110
I have had it!

290
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,552
You are putting down
that goddamn camera!

291
00:16:53,672 --> 00:16:57,149
You'll be really glad we have
all this footage of the family some day.

292
00:17:04,218 --> 00:17:05,453
Wait here a minute.

293
00:17:11,292 --> 00:17:12,117
Behold!

294
00:17:12,975 --> 00:17:15,788
I am standing on your precious land.

295
00:17:16,376 --> 00:17:18,785
I've waited a long time for this.

296
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,716
What's he doing?

297
00:17:28,064 --> 00:17:29,677
What of your prophecy now?

298
00:17:29,995 --> 00:17:31,670
Nothing can stop me!

299
00:17:39,346 --> 00:17:40,706
How did you get here?

300
00:17:41,005 --> 00:17:43,941
It's that asshole who sent us
to the jungle with nobody to pick us up!

301
00:17:44,268 --> 00:17:46,166
Sir, is everything all right?

302
00:17:46,507 --> 00:17:48,377
- Shoot them!
- Shoot them?

303
00:17:48,766 --> 00:17:51,740
They're a Peruvian band that escaped!
We must keep them contained!

304
00:17:52,252 --> 00:17:53,584
No, listen to me.

305
00:17:53,704 --> 00:17:56,141
The Peruvian bands were keeping
the guinea creatures away!

306
00:17:56,261 --> 00:17:59,415
All of this is happening because you
got rid of all the flute bands!

307
00:18:00,005 --> 00:18:01,208
I said, "shoot them!"

308
00:18:01,501 --> 00:18:03,752
Goo look!
It's all an ancient incan prophecy.

309
00:18:04,753 --> 00:18:06,498
Maybe we should look at it, sir.

310
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:07,995
Damn you, Craig!

311
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,664
You just don't ever stop, do you?

312
00:18:11,907 --> 00:18:14,474
- I didn't say anything.
- You see for thousands of years,

313
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:17,558
horrid creatures have lived
in the guinea valley of Peru.

314
00:18:17,925 --> 00:18:20,962
The incas learned how to keep
the creatures at bay,

315
00:18:21,082 --> 00:18:22,683
by playing pan flute music.

316
00:18:23,297 --> 00:18:25,868
Guinea creatures hate it even
more than humans do.

317
00:18:26,285 --> 00:18:29,804
But the prophecy foretold that one day
the creatures would be unleashed

318
00:18:29,924 --> 00:18:32,072
and I have made that happen!

319
00:18:32,404 --> 00:18:34,544
The incas predicted the world
would be saved,

320
00:18:35,431 --> 00:18:36,452
by Craig,

321
00:18:37,069 --> 00:18:39,830
but that part of the prophecy will
not come true!

322
00:18:40,297 --> 00:18:42,458
For you will all die
on this mountain!

323
00:18:47,378 --> 00:18:48,797
You're some kind of monster!

324
00:18:49,446 --> 00:18:51,092
Oh, I'm much more than that.

325
00:18:51,646 --> 00:18:54,636
Guinea bees, guinea rabbits,
guinea saurus rexes.

326
00:18:55,007 --> 00:18:57,437
I am something much more evil.

327
00:19:04,422 --> 00:19:05,570
Guinea pirate!

328
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,107
Jesus christ!

329
00:19:07,441 --> 00:19:09,150
Sir, I promise you,

330
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,706
I'm not going to ruin your plans.

331
00:19:12,105 --> 00:19:13,962
I'll just walk away. See.

332
00:19:29,406 --> 00:19:31,610
Now there's sparks
shooting out my eyes.

333
00:19:32,793 --> 00:19:34,160
Curse ye, Craig!

334
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,261
Stop!

335
00:19:51,494 --> 00:19:53,186
My name is Craig Tucker.

336
00:19:53,752 --> 00:19:57,121
Last week, I stopped a guinea pirate
from taking over the Earth.

337
00:19:58,742 --> 00:20:01,411
All the Peruvian flute bands
were released.

338
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:05,712
And drove the guinea creatures
back to Andes mountains.

339
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,155
Many people had died,
but mankind had prevailed.

340
00:20:12,663 --> 00:20:15,187
All over the world,
survivors were found.

341
00:20:15,573 --> 00:20:18,256
Living witnesses to the terror
that had been seen.

342
00:20:19,402 --> 00:20:20,673
Here, look! Look!

343
00:20:21,027 --> 00:20:24,259
What the...
I didn't have a tape in it.

344
00:20:26,388 --> 00:20:27,884
The guinea pirate lived,

345
00:20:28,004 --> 00:20:31,191
but was taken to the prison to live
out the rest of his days.

346
00:20:32,181 --> 00:20:33,818
And people all over the world

347
00:20:33,938 --> 00:20:36,781
learned to support their local
Peruvian flute bands.

348
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:39,646
And buy their cds,

349
00:20:39,766 --> 00:20:42,081
for they protect us
from the guinea creatures.

350
00:20:43,864 --> 00:20:47,047
As for me, I was returned home
by homeland security.

351
00:20:47,167 --> 00:20:49,180
My parents were so happy.

352
00:20:50,662 --> 00:20:54,106
I realized that we don't always
have control over what happens to us.

353
00:20:54,226 --> 00:20:56,216
We are but players
on the stage of life.

354
00:20:57,855 --> 00:21:01,471
And I also learned to never listen
when people come ask you for money.

355
00:21:06,151 --> 00:21:07,431
That's guy an asshole.

356
00:21:07,581 --> 00:21:08,835
Yeah, what a dick.

357
00:21:08,955 --> 00:21:10,245
I hate Craig!

358
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:19,239
- Sir, sir we have a problem.
- What now?

359
00:21:19,729 --> 00:21:23,478
The former director of homeland security
that turned out to be a guinea pig,

360
00:21:23,972 --> 00:21:26,288
it attacked the guards,
got out of its holding cell.

361
00:21:28,132 --> 00:21:29,582
My God, are you telling me...

362
00:21:29,858 --> 00:21:32,485
Yes, sir. It broke out of prison.
