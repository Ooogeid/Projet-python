00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,417
Children, let's all take our seats.

4
00:00:39,577 --> 00:00:42,180
Before we get started today.
Wendy Testaburger has asked

5
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,797
to share something with the class.

6
00:00:46,461 --> 00:00:47,752
Thank you, Mr. Garrison.

7
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:49,877
Fellow students,
October is awareness month

8
00:00:49,997 --> 00:00:52,100
for the one of the leading causes
of death for women.

9
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,426
A terrible disease that takes the lives
of american women every day.

10
00:00:55,546 --> 00:00:58,103
I'm talking of course
about breast cancer.

11
00:01:03,446 --> 00:01:07,094
An estimated one in six women
will deal with cancer in their lifetime

12
00:01:07,214 --> 00:01:09,425
and breast cancer is
the most common.

13
00:01:09,895 --> 00:01:11,198
She said it again.

14
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:14,865
Is there a problem?
Because breast cancer isn't funny.

15
00:01:15,167 --> 00:01:16,746
Breast cancer is killing people.

16
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,808
Do we really need all
of this potty talk in the classroom?

17
00:01:20,596 --> 00:01:22,544
Eric, for the love of Jesus.

18
00:01:23,032 --> 00:01:26,756
This is a serious issue,
what you're doing is very offensive.

19
00:01:27,309 --> 00:01:30,000
Me? You're the one talking
about killer titties.

20
00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:33,516
Watch out guys, Wendy says
boobs can kill you.

21
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:37,684
- I'm gonna get you.
- I don't wanna get killed by boobs.

22
00:01:38,071 --> 00:01:39,604
Will somebody do something?

23
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:42,594
Every week he gets worse
and nobody does anything.

24
00:01:42,857 --> 00:01:44,315
Eric, stop being offensive.

25
00:01:44,632 --> 00:01:48,236
I'm trying to engage {\Wendy in}a constructive
dialog about breast cancer awareness.

26
00:01:48,824 --> 00:01:50,029
No, you aren't.

27
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:51,473
You need to calm down,

28
00:01:51,593 --> 00:01:54,170
you'll get your boobs angry
and they'll start killing everyone.

29
00:01:56,603 --> 00:01:57,942
I'm on fire today!

30
00:02:00,807 --> 00:02:03,610
Look out everyone, there's
some killer titties on the loose.

31
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,024
Could have swore I heard them
coming through the roof.

32
00:02:07,096 --> 00:02:09,384
Officer, we need to get
an APB out on those titties,

33
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:12,242
- they're armed and dangerous.
- What is your problem?

34
00:02:12,362 --> 00:02:14,220
Breast cancer isn't funny.

35
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,402
Not at all.

36
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,903
Wendy, we're gonna get you.

37
00:02:18,023 --> 00:02:19,759
Where are your bobs?
We're gonna kill you.

38
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:22,012
You better shut up
or I'll make you shut up.

39
00:02:22,132 --> 00:02:24,481
Really?
What are you gonna do about it?

40
00:02:24,601 --> 00:02:27,127
I'm gonna kick your ass,
that's what I am going to do.

41
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:28,732
You're gonna kick my ass?

42
00:02:28,852 --> 00:02:31,194
That's right,
I am gonna kick your ass.

43
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:33,740
You want to throw down, dawg,
I'll throw down.

44
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,531
- You think you're tough.
- Wassup? Wassup?

45
00:02:36,694 --> 00:02:40,020
- I'll smack the shit out of you.
- I stay right here, let's go bitch.

46
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,136
After school,
we fight after school, you got that?

47
00:02:43,256 --> 00:02:45,223
You're gonna fight me after school?

48
00:02:45,343 --> 00:02:47,724
- That's right.
- You're a chick, dude.

49
00:02:47,844 --> 00:02:50,783
As soon as that bell rings
we do it outside, you got that?

50
00:02:50,903 --> 00:02:53,426
- And you better be there.
- It's on bitch.

51
00:02:53,586 --> 00:02:55,220
You're gonna fucking die!

52
00:02:57,491 --> 00:03:00,600
Wendy and Eric are fighting
after school. Hey, everybody!

53
00:03:01,407 --> 00:03:03,535
Wendy and Eric are fighting
after school.

54
00:03:03,655 --> 00:03:04,655
What?

55
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,855
Wendy and Cartman are gonna fight
after school.

56
00:03:07,975 --> 00:03:08,775
Really?

57
00:03:10,872 --> 00:03:14,664
Wendy and Cartman
are fighting after school.

58
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:21,043
Emo kids, Cartman and Wendy
are gonna fight after school.

59
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:24,374
Did she just call us emos?

60
00:03:28,056 --> 00:03:30,588
Gee, I can't believe,
Wendy gonna fight you after school.

61
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,473
She is pissed off.

62
00:03:32,792 --> 00:03:35,196
She's not gonna show up
to a fight, dawg.

63
00:03:35,316 --> 00:03:37,995
I'm sure she's already tried
to figure out a way to get out of it.

64
00:03:38,115 --> 00:03:40,598
Check it out,
she's totally staring you down.

65
00:03:46,874 --> 00:03:49,711
She sure seems confident, you should
probably go easy on her, dude,

66
00:03:49,831 --> 00:03:51,902
you don't wanna put her
in a hospital or anything.

67
00:03:52,022 --> 00:03:55,415
I'm gonna teach her a lesson,
I'm not gonna totally kick her ass.

68
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:02,412
Can't go too easy on her,

69
00:04:02,572 --> 00:04:05,164
god forbid she actually gets
a good punch and beat you.

70
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:09,794
If you get beat by a girl,
everyone would think you're a faggot.

71
00:04:25,071 --> 00:04:27,032
Could I talk to you for a second?

72
00:04:27,152 --> 00:04:28,152
What?

73
00:04:29,253 --> 00:04:30,872
I want to apologize

74
00:04:30,992 --> 00:04:32,930
- and tell you that...
- What?

75
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:35,125
I want to apologize

76
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,403
and tell you that...
I'm sorry for what I said, okay?

77
00:04:38,648 --> 00:04:42,006
It was wrong of me and I promise you
that it won't happen again.

78
00:04:42,335 --> 00:04:44,757
I don't want to fight you
after school, all right?

79
00:04:44,877 --> 00:04:46,002
So, I'm sorry.

80
00:04:46,225 --> 00:04:48,958
If you're really sorry
you can say it in front of everyone!

81
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,142
Actually I was thinking
let's just keep this between us.

82
00:04:54,262 --> 00:04:57,879
I was wrong to make fun of breast
cancer and I'm very remorsefulness.

83
00:04:58,504 --> 00:05:01,631
No, if you're really sorry
and you want to apologize to me,

84
00:05:01,751 --> 00:05:03,372
then do it in front of everyone!

85
00:05:05,746 --> 00:05:06,768
Apologize?

86
00:05:06,888 --> 00:05:08,873
That's not what I said dumb bitch.

87
00:05:09,885 --> 00:05:13,860
You did, you stood there and said you
apologized and don't want to fight.

88
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,136
Such a desperate attempt
to get out of it.

89
00:05:17,256 --> 00:05:18,970
These students are
a little too smart

90
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,310
to see you're making excuses
to get out of fighting me.

91
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,823
I don't want an excuse. I'm gonna beat
the fuckin' shit out of you.

92
00:05:26,731 --> 00:05:28,779
That's funny, you're going to die,

93
00:05:29,225 --> 00:05:30,225
lezbo.

94
00:05:34,936 --> 00:05:36,292
Seriously dawg,

95
00:05:36,412 --> 00:05:38,125
I do want to apologize,

96
00:05:38,245 --> 00:05:40,439
I'm really sorry
I don't think we should fight.

97
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:41,828
Get away from me!

98
00:05:48,232 --> 00:05:50,526
So, everyone is saying
there's going to be a fight

99
00:05:50,646 --> 00:05:52,735
between Cartman and your girlfriend.

100
00:05:53,011 --> 00:05:54,023
I guess so.

101
00:05:55,277 --> 00:05:58,570
And you're gonna... just let
at that guy beat up on your woman?

102
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:02,367
Doesn't that like... go against
your jockey man code or something?

103
00:06:03,223 --> 00:06:04,525
I don't ever remember

104
00:06:04,645 --> 00:06:08,079
AC/DC singing about letting it dudes
beat up on their girlfriends.

105
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:10,372
What am I supposed to do about it?

106
00:06:10,492 --> 00:06:12,835
Don't worry,
I don't think it's going to happen.

107
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:15,519
Cartman says that Wendy is begging
him to it call the fight off.

108
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:17,602
- I'll bet she is.
- I hope that,

109
00:06:17,722 --> 00:06:20,054
I wanna see her
kick the crap out of him.

110
00:06:25,238 --> 00:06:27,510
- What?
- Just real quick, real quick.

111
00:06:30,609 --> 00:06:32,428
You're not gonna believe this,

112
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,186
I just found out my mom
has breast cancer.

113
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:38,137
Man, I sure got
what was coming to me.

114
00:06:38,644 --> 00:06:42,113
I was a real jerk and now,
they're gonna cut off my mom's boobs.

115
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,687
You really think
that's gonna work on me?

116
00:06:50,273 --> 00:06:52,772
I have here $27 in cash.

117
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:56,552
- If you just call off the fight then...
- You can't bribe your way out of this.

118
00:06:57,783 --> 00:07:00,355
- I have muscular dystrophy.
- You don't.

119
00:07:01,757 --> 00:07:03,581
My mom has muscular dystrophy

120
00:07:04,222 --> 00:07:06,805
- in her boobs.
- You don't get it asshole,

121
00:07:06,925 --> 00:07:08,906
there's nothing you can do
to stop this fight.

122
00:07:09,026 --> 00:07:12,313
I am gonna wipe the playground
with you in front of everyone.

123
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:16,404
I'm gonna shove your ass, down your
throat and make you eat your underwear.

124
00:07:17,436 --> 00:07:19,549
- Eat my underwear?
- That's right.

125
00:07:21,998 --> 00:07:24,363
I would eat my underwear,
right here and right now.

126
00:07:24,788 --> 00:07:27,617
Jesus Christ!
Do you have no sense of self-respect?

127
00:07:28,546 --> 00:07:31,036
Unless you want me to, you want me
to have self-respect and I will.

128
00:07:31,342 --> 00:07:33,361
You suck so hard.

129
00:07:33,596 --> 00:07:34,882
I'll eat my underwear

130
00:07:35,002 --> 00:07:37,373
and then you be satisfied
we'll put this whole thing behind us.

131
00:07:37,493 --> 00:07:40,099
- What are you doing?
- I'm committed to peace,

132
00:07:40,702 --> 00:07:43,121
I want you to see just
how humbled I am,

133
00:07:44,442 --> 00:07:45,651
how much I...

134
00:07:49,951 --> 00:07:51,242
Look at me, Wendy.

135
00:07:57,055 --> 00:07:58,064
Oh, my god.

136
00:08:00,641 --> 00:08:01,734
Are we cool?

137
00:08:03,145 --> 00:08:06,428
I ate my underwear,
what the hell do you want from me?

138
00:08:07,316 --> 00:08:08,875
You are so pathetic.

139
00:08:10,093 --> 00:08:11,948
I ate my underwear for you.

140
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:15,958
Yo, what's up dawg?

141
00:08:22,306 --> 00:08:23,881
- We need to talk.
- What?

142
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,559
Wendy and I are suppose
to fight in like three hours.

143
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:29,381
- Dude, aren't you worried?
- Wendy is a girl,

144
00:08:29,501 --> 00:08:31,476
she could end up
getting really hurt.

145
00:08:31,772 --> 00:08:35,193
You're my bro and she's your bitch,
I don't wanna hurt my bro's bitch.

146
00:08:35,313 --> 00:08:37,480
I can't do anything,
she really want to fight you.

147
00:08:38,422 --> 00:08:40,944
She doesn't.
She told me she doesn't wanna fight.

148
00:08:41,064 --> 00:08:44,038
She's just stuck. Because she knows
I am gonna kick her ass,

149
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:46,988
but she feels like if she doesn't fight
me, all the kids will call her chicken.

150
00:08:48,107 --> 00:08:49,751
- Really?
- Now what she did,

151
00:08:50,021 --> 00:08:52,591
she apologized
and begged me not to fight her.

152
00:08:52,711 --> 00:08:55,463
I said if you're so sorry,
say it in front of everyone,

153
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:56,581
but she wouldn't.

154
00:08:56,742 --> 00:08:59,582
That's how desperate she is.
You have to do something, Stan,

155
00:08:59,702 --> 00:09:03,475
you have to be a man and forbid her
for fighting so she has a way.

156
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:15,247
Oh, that's where I put those.

157
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,492
Anyway, you've got to put
a stop to this fight.

158
00:09:17,612 --> 00:09:19,394
Wendy's stucked, she needs you.

159
00:09:19,514 --> 00:09:21,844
Dude, there's nothing I can
do about it.

160
00:09:22,309 --> 00:09:24,950
God, you are such a pussy,
Stan, you're such a pussy,

161
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:28,068
When I hurt Wendy it's gonna be
on your fucking head.

162
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:38,481
And so you see,

163
00:09:38,601 --> 00:09:42,335
at this point your rip disease
knew he could not win the battle.

164
00:09:47,412 --> 00:09:50,994
<i>I'm going to wipe the playground
with you right in front of everyone.</i>

165
00:09:51,362 --> 00:09:54,388
<i>If you got beat by a girl
everyone would say you're a faggot.</i>

166
00:09:54,572 --> 00:09:56,397
Alright kids for
your homework tonight,

167
00:09:56,517 --> 00:09:59,018
I want you to read chapter 7.

168
00:10:04,547 --> 00:10:06,442
Kick this ass Wendy!

169
00:10:08,815 --> 00:10:12,129
When the bell rings we've got to get out
there and find a good place to watch.

170
00:10:14,418 --> 00:10:17,370
<i>There's no way out, she's gonna kick
my ass in front of everyone.</i>

171
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:18,703
Almost dead.

172
00:10:18,864 --> 00:10:21,154
And be be ready for a quiz
tomorrow morning.

173
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:24,784
I totally can't see the fight,
I've got detention after school.

174
00:10:26,443 --> 00:10:28,214
Detention, that's it!

175
00:10:28,978 --> 00:10:30,967
<i>I've got to get detention fast!</i>

176
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,361
Eric, did you just take
a crap on my desk?

177
00:10:51,647 --> 00:10:53,066
What's up?
What's up?

178
00:10:53,478 --> 00:10:56,036
Crapped on your desk doc,
what's up with that?

179
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,626
Welcome to detention mkay?

180
00:11:06,089 --> 00:11:08,879
You're here until your parents
come and pick you up.

181
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,090
Use your time to study.

182
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:13,988
Sweet.

183
00:11:22,273 --> 00:11:23,611
Eric, what's going on.

184
00:11:23,731 --> 00:11:27,148
Everyone says you got detention
on purpose to get out of fighting Wendy.

185
00:11:27,308 --> 00:11:28,524
What? That's ridiculous.

186
00:11:28,816 --> 00:11:31,694
But some people say you crapped
on the desk to get detention.

187
00:11:32,419 --> 00:11:35,323
- That's not why I did it.
- Why did you crap on the desk?

188
00:11:35,483 --> 00:11:36,925
Because I'm hardcore.

189
00:11:37,045 --> 00:11:39,027
I'm anti-establishment,

190
00:11:39,147 --> 00:11:42,204
that's how I roll, dawg, I do
hardcore stuff like that.

191
00:11:42,429 --> 00:11:44,790
That's what I said.
I told everyone outside

192
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:47,987
He is not scared of fighting Wendy.
He'd do it if he could.

193
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:50,983
Damn straight I got all punk rock
and got detention,

194
00:11:51,103 --> 00:11:53,337
- I'm just a bad dude.
- That's good

195
00:11:53,457 --> 00:11:56,116
because we moved the fight
to first thing in the morning tomorrow.

196
00:11:56,236 --> 00:11:59,401
Before school starts.
Everyone is going to get there early.

197
00:12:00,007 --> 00:12:01,724
Your detention doesn't matter.

198
00:12:01,976 --> 00:12:04,894
Get your buns back over here, mkay.

199
00:12:05,277 --> 00:12:07,415
She says she will be there
an hour before school starts,

200
00:12:07,535 --> 00:12:08,943
see you in the morning.

201
00:12:18,189 --> 00:12:20,459
Tomorrow morning, you die

202
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:22,370
tomorrow morning.

203
00:12:34,174 --> 00:12:36,793
We need to talk to you, right now!

204
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,356
Wendy, have you been bullying
kids at school?

205
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:42,506
What?

206
00:12:42,873 --> 00:12:46,185
Can you explain why this little boy's
mother had to come talk to us?

207
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:51,702
Did you tell this little boy
you were going to beat him up?

208
00:12:51,822 --> 00:12:54,657
You don't understand
he said horrible things.

209
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:57,822
The thing is, I totally said
I was sorry,

210
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,324
but she still wants to beat me up.

211
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:07,358
No matter what a person says,
you don't respond with violence.

212
00:13:07,478 --> 00:13:09,287
Haven't we taught you that?

213
00:13:09,407 --> 00:13:11,147
The thing is Wendy,

214
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:13,266
I really think you're awesome,

215
00:13:13,517 --> 00:13:16,574
and I know I'm just
a nerdy little weakling to you,

216
00:13:16,694 --> 00:13:18,211
but I want to be your friend

217
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:22,831
because I don't have
that many friends at school.

218
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:28,397
Wendy, you tell this little
boy you aren't going to hurt him!

219
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:30,729
- Mom, you don't...
- Now, young lady.

220
00:13:31,796 --> 00:13:33,232
I'm not going to hurt you.

221
00:13:33,392 --> 00:13:36,590
If there's any word of you fighting
at school, it's over for you missy,

222
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:37,976
do you understand?

223
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,282
We're so sorry about this,
miss Cartman.

224
00:13:41,517 --> 00:13:43,930
Oh, no, thank you so much for
your time.

225
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:45,619
It really won't happen again.

226
00:13:46,154 --> 00:13:48,333
You're very sweet.
Thank you again.

227
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:49,661
Come on, muffin.

228
00:13:49,781 --> 00:13:51,037
Okay, mommy.

229
00:13:59,174 --> 00:14:02,191
Man, it's almost time for school
to start. Wendy still isn't here.

230
00:14:02,311 --> 00:14:04,305
I don't know what's going on.
I showed up.

231
00:14:04,546 --> 00:14:07,141
Where is she? How come she
is not showing up for the fight.

232
00:14:07,439 --> 00:14:08,680
Here she comes!

233
00:14:10,657 --> 00:14:12,887
What's up, I thought we
were meeting early to fight.

234
00:14:13,007 --> 00:14:14,742
You know I can't fight you.

235
00:14:14,984 --> 00:14:16,404
Why not?
You chicken?

236
00:14:18,704 --> 00:14:22,698
I can't figt you because you came crying
to my house last night with your mom.

237
00:14:23,727 --> 00:14:26,384
That's a dozie, did you come up
with that one on your own.

238
00:14:26,894 --> 00:14:29,058
Yeah, you come up with that
one on your own?

239
00:14:29,315 --> 00:14:32,124
I ain't frontin' dawg, let's do it.
Let's do it right now!

240
00:14:32,445 --> 00:14:34,881
- Come on, Wendy, kick his ass!
- I can't!

241
00:14:37,234 --> 00:14:38,430
God dammit,

242
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,318
she chickened out.

243
00:14:42,198 --> 00:14:43,423
I told you guys!

244
00:14:43,805 --> 00:14:45,288
Oh, I'm glad that's over with.

245
00:14:45,408 --> 00:14:48,042
Yeah, guess who dodged
a bullet, Galahad.

246
00:14:48,814 --> 00:14:51,905
I always knew deep down
Wendy didn't have any ball.

247
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,484
And so we must all recycle
every day.

248
00:14:58,937 --> 00:15:02,486
Recycling is important
and it will save our planet

249
00:15:02,864 --> 00:15:03,698
earth.

250
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:04,924
The end.

251
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,348
Very nice, Clyde. Okay, we have time
for one more report

252
00:15:08,468 --> 00:15:10,204
before recess, who would like to go?

253
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,255
Thank you.

254
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,548
My report today is on breast
cancer awareness.

255
00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:23,828
I do not believe enough
is being done

256
00:15:23,948 --> 00:15:26,021
and like the victims
of breast cancer,

257
00:15:26,141 --> 00:15:28,521
there's something
i'd like to get off my chest.

258
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:35,944
We all must fight and hopefully kid
titty cancer will be a distant memory.

259
00:15:39,677 --> 00:15:43,112
You unbelievable bastard.
You beat me, but you won't stop.

260
00:15:43,323 --> 00:15:46,198
What did the breast cancer
say to the polish monkey?

261
00:15:46,358 --> 00:15:48,742
Okay, Eric, that's enough
you smart ass.

262
00:15:49,222 --> 00:15:51,412
Why? Why are you doing this to me?

263
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,579
Why won't you just stop.

264
00:15:54,729 --> 00:15:57,251
>> Wendy testaburger
to the principal's office, please?

265
00:15:57,684 --> 00:15:59,962
Wendy testaburger to the
principal's office.

266
00:16:00,453 --> 00:16:01,271
God!

267
00:16:07,571 --> 00:16:11,542
I've been hearing rumors about a fight
between you and Eric Cartman.

268
00:16:12,645 --> 00:16:14,560
No, ma'am there isn't going
to be a fight.

269
00:16:15,044 --> 00:16:16,978
Oh, no?
Are you sure?

270
00:16:17,431 --> 00:16:18,522
Yes, ma'am.

271
00:16:19,247 --> 00:16:20,261
I see.

272
00:16:20,866 --> 00:16:24,346
I noticed all the things you've done
for breast cancer awareness month.

273
00:16:25,715 --> 00:16:28,505
Did you know
I'm a breast cancer survivor?

274
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:30,331
Ma'am?

275
00:16:31,617 --> 00:16:34,038
I was diagnosed seven years ago.

276
00:16:34,158 --> 00:16:36,225
Cancer is pure evil,

277
00:16:36,345 --> 00:16:39,877
it is fat little lump
that needs to be destroyed.

278
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:44,667
When there is a cancer,
you have to fight it.

279
00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:50,305
You can't reason with cancer,
you can't wish it away.

280
00:16:50,425 --> 00:16:53,307
Cancer doesn't play by the rules
so neither can you.

281
00:16:54,987 --> 00:16:57,439
My parents said that if I fight...

282
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:00,895
And you can't listen to what
anybody else tells you.

283
00:17:01,015 --> 00:17:04,339
You have to be willing
to give up everything

284
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:07,227
because the cancer
will take everything.

285
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:08,697
Do you understand?

286
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,319
Yes, ma'am!

287
00:17:13,106 --> 00:17:15,270
When you have cancer,
you fight

288
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:18,116
because it doesn't matter
if you beat it or not.

289
00:17:18,236 --> 00:17:23,383
You refuse to let that fat little lump
think you feel powerless.

290
00:17:29,492 --> 00:17:32,780
She's gonna fight. Wendy's gonna fight
Cartman right now.

291
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:33,788
What?

292
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:46,270
Go deep, Craig.

293
00:17:47,117 --> 00:17:48,529
Not that deep, retard.

294
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,479
She's coming. She's coming.

295
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:53,403
- Butters get out of here.
- Wendy is coming to fight you.

296
00:18:11,088 --> 00:18:12,344
Boy, here we go.

297
00:18:13,706 --> 00:18:15,099
About freaking time.

298
00:18:17,372 --> 00:18:18,961
All right.
Let's do it!

299
00:18:20,322 --> 00:18:21,291
What's up?

300
00:18:21,457 --> 00:18:22,506
What's up?

301
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:25,678
Wendy, don't forget
I'll tell my mom on you.

302
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,299
I don't care.

303
00:18:33,001 --> 00:18:35,576
Recess is almost over, I don't know
if there's really time.

304
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,952
Shut up and fight!

305
00:18:42,885 --> 00:18:45,624
Alright, fine Wendy, I'll fight you.

306
00:19:25,269 --> 00:19:26,543
Screw him up, Wendy!

307
00:20:00,028 --> 00:20:01,390
I'm finished.

308
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,293
Somebody, somebody
call the principal!

309
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,858
You have don't have
to say anything.

310
00:20:18,311 --> 00:20:19,976
I know how it is.

311
00:20:20,328 --> 00:20:22,148
I'm no longer the cool kid.

312
00:20:22,995 --> 00:20:26,142
Now you all think I'm a fag.

313
00:20:30,092 --> 00:20:31,528
My school life is over

314
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:35,508
because now all the guys
don't think I'm cool.

315
00:20:39,252 --> 00:20:41,118
Dude, we never thought
you were cool.

316
00:20:42,477 --> 00:20:43,975
That's not true.

317
00:20:44,315 --> 00:20:46,358
You're just saying that.

318
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,880
No, really, we've always
thought you suck.

319
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,297
Yeah, nothing's changed. Our opinion
of you can't possibly go any lower.

320
00:20:54,408 --> 00:20:58,085
You're just saying that
to make me feel better.

321
00:20:59,254 --> 00:21:01,305
No, it's true.
We've always hated you.

322
00:21:02,901 --> 00:21:05,680
Don't try and make me feel better,
you guys.

323
00:21:07,179 --> 00:21:08,520
Wait, wait a minute,

324
00:21:08,995 --> 00:21:11,990
why would you guys be saying stuff
to make me feel better?

325
00:21:12,777 --> 00:21:13,670
Unless,

326
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:16,194
unless you do think I'm cool.

327
00:21:18,145 --> 00:21:18,984
What?

328
00:21:19,104 --> 00:21:23,096
If you're all trying to make me feel
better then you must still like me.

329
00:21:26,573 --> 00:21:29,326
I've been so worried about you
guys were going to think of me

330
00:21:29,446 --> 00:21:31,157
getting beat up by a girl.

331
00:21:31,277 --> 00:21:33,921
It turns out you think I'm cool
no matter what!

332
00:21:35,551 --> 00:21:37,388
Oh, God, what a relief!
