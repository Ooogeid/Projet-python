00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,452


3
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:37,704


4
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,955


5
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:43,126
Hey, everybody!
How's it going?

6
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,337


7
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,005


8
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:50,800
I just can't seem to stop.

9
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:53,302


10
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,347
You goin' swimming?

11
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,307
Don't forget to bring a towel!

12
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:00,434


13
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:01,895
Get out of my face!

14
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,354
Get out of here!

15
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:07,942


16
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:11,780
My name is Towelie.

17
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:15,450
T-o-w-e-l...

18
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:19,829
y-e-y.

19
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:23,458
I'm great at cleaning up spills.

20
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:28,505
And I'm 100% machine washable.

21
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:32,175
I'm just an ordinary towel
in a lot of ways.

22
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:33,635
Except for one.

23
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,846
I'm addicted to marijuana.

24
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:38,640
And crystal meth.

25
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:40,600
And crack.

26
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,315


27
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,152


28
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:55,031
Anybody want their dick sucked?

29
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:58,368
Does anybody want
their dick sucked by a towel?

30
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,830
Towelie has become
a complete nightmare in our town.

31
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,666
He's broken into my house twice
and stolen my allowance.

32
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,500
I've got almost nothing left.

33
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:09,045
If we're playing outside,
he shows up completely wasted

34
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,964
and screaming
the government is after him.

35
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,926
I just don't want
to watch him kill himself!

36
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,721
I don't even know who he is anymore!

37
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:22,517
There's is no doubt in my mind
that if we don't get Towelie help,

38
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:24,644
our entire summer
is gonna be ruined.

39
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:30,483


40
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,494
Oh boy!
It's our favorite time of year!

41
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,289
We get to see
all our old friends again.

42
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,081
There's Francis!
Hey, Francis!

43
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,213
Look at Lenora, everyone.
Good job!

44
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:54,257
Come on.
Good job, Lenora!

45
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:57,218
All right, good.
Let's get Lenora a towel.

46
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,346
C'mon, where's the towel?

47
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,724
The towel isn't here.
I think it's off getting high again.

48
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:07,020


49
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:10,815


50
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:14,819
Where's that towel?

51
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,779
Just a sec!

52
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:20,450
We got Towelie a job,
so he could try and pays us back.

53
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:21,617
Stupid towel.

54
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:23,203
What's going on, towel?

55
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,498
Just had to take a piss.
Sorry.

56
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,958
We got wet campers down there.
Move your ass!

57
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:31,961
When Towelie is doing heroin,
he doesn't care about anything.

58
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,548
I don't care about anything.

59
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:38,301
Stupid handicap camp.

60
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,429
All right, blue team.
As team captain,

61
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,931
I need to make sure we're ready
for the big camp competition.

62
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,350
We're weady!

63
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,518
We can weawy stick it
to wed team this yew!

64
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,021
No way red team can beat us.

65
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,606
Red team won't know what hit them.

66
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,652
All right. Everyone together!
Are we gonna beat red team this year?

67
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,365
All right!

68
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,867
I can't stand him, Mimsy.

69
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:06,037
That Jimmy kid
makes my fucking skin crawl.

70
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,123
You've always hated him.

71
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,375
Ever since he whooped you
at soifin' last summer camp.

72
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,085
He really took it to ya good.

73
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:15,213
- Shut up, Mimsy.
- Sorry, boss.

74
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:16,714
Listen to me.

75
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:20,802
There is no way that blue team
will beat red team this year at camp.

76
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:21,969
You got that?

77
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:25,557


78
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:29,644


79
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:33,565
What we need to do,
is use a little brain power

80
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,067
to make sure
blue team can't compete.

81
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,403
Oh boy!
We'll ruin blue team's chances?

82
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,862
We'll break their legs?

83
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:41,781
Shut up!

84
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,826
Just do what I say
and we can make sure

85
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,203
Jimmy Valmer
gets what's comin' to him.

86
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,748
There ya go.
All better now?

87
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,125
Yes, thanks.

88
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,837
That's right, when you go swimmin',
don't forget to bring a...

89
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,631
Who hired that towel?

90
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:01,258
It can barely walk,
let alone dry somebody off.

91
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,219
You think you're better than me?

92
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,512
You think you're fucking hot shit?

93
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,934
When Towelie shoots heroin,
he just gets angry at everybody.

94
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,686
You can all suck it!

95
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,855
You're all a bunch of towels.
That's what you are!

96
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,651
The thing is,
Towelie was pretty happy before.

97
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,235
He had a girlfriend.

98
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:25,574
And she got pregnant
and had a little Washcloth.

99
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:30,205
But Towelie just kept
getting more and more high,

100
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,122
and he got kicked out of the house.

101
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,500
Fuck you!
Lemme talk to him.

102
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,627
Lemme talk to him, you bitch!

103
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:39,672


104
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:43,176


105
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,430
I'm not high!
I haven't been high since Wednesday.

106
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:50,808
It is Wednesday?

107
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:53,645
All right, campers!

108
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,480
Our first event
is the big canoe race.

109
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,858
Oh boy, the canoe race!

110
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,737
We gotta...
we gotta beat the red team!

111
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,616
I've got it.

112
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:10,161
I got a way to win the race
and get rid of Jimmy for good.

113
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,413
Oh boy!
What're we gonna do, boss?

114
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:13,748
Simple.

115
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,500
We're gonna put
a little surprise in the canoe.

116
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,046
What kind of a surprise?
It's a snake!

117
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:23,257
Not just any snake.
It's a black mamba.

118
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,469


119
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:30,098


120
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,810
Gee wiz, boss.
We'll kill all the blue team and Jimmy?

121
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,356
You boys excited for the canoe race?

122
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:41,901
Yes, counselor Steve.
I like duh fun canoe.

123
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,028
Canoes are fun, aren't they?

124
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,408
Take the black mamba
and put it in the canoe.

125
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,950
I'll go get our team ready.

126
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,787
All right, campers, are we ready?

127
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:55,456
Good luck, Jimmy.

128
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:56,999
You too, Nathan.

129
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,793
You're gonna need it,
you fucking asshole.

130
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,921
On your mark.
Get set.

131
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:20,481
Holy shit!
What the hell did you do?

132
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:23,442
You said ta put da black mamba
in the canoe!

133
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,819
Not in our canoe!

134
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,781


135
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:31,993


136
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,832


137
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,045
We need a towel!

138
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,048
Just a sec!

139
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,425
Not just a sec.
We got a bunch of wet campers!

140
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,676
What's going on?

141
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:56,517


142
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,313
You owe me money, asshole!

143
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:04,483
That's it. We're done.
You are no longer employed here.

144
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:05,776
Please, sir.

145
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,988
We need a nice, clean towel
here at summer camp.

146
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:12,157
We don't need a towel that shoots
heroin and has sex for money!

147
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,369
Some people are so picky
about their towels.

148
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,162
Campers!

149
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,332
Next event
is the big scavenger hunt.

150
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,209
Blue team is gonna go first!

151
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:25,004
I finally got it.

152
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:28,299
I got a way we can kill Jimmy
and beat the blue team.

153
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,343
Oh boy!
What're we gonna do?

154
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:33,638
Simple. We're going to get Jimmy
killed by Native Americans.

155
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:37,182
Here take this.
It's a fake scavenger hunt map.

156
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,602
This map leads
to the scavenger hunt?

157
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,230
That map leads
to the Indian reservation.

158
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,274
We switch this with blue team's
scavenger hunting map,

159
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:48,861
and they'll end up right on
the Tardicaca Indian reservation.

160
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:52,323


161
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:56,869


162
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,872
Oh boy!
We'll get Jimmy killed by Indians?

163
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,584
Are you boys excited
for the neat scavenger hunt?

164
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:07,255
Yes, counselor Steve.
I like scavenger hunt.

165
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,759
All right.
Take this map to the reservation

166
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,553
and you switch it with blue team's.

167
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:17,140
You got that?
You switch the map. Switch the map.

168
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,892
I got it.
Switch the map! Switch the map!

169
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,021
How come we're scavenger huntin'?

170
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:26,524
Because, stupid,
now that we have blue team's map

171
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,818
we can get
their scavenger prize too.

172
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:29,902
Oh boy!

173
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,572
This doesn't make sense.

174
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,533
Why would they make us go this far?
We're handicapped.

175
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,034
Turn left at the...

176
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,202
Wait.

177
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:39,828
Wait a minute.
What the...

178
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,914


179
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,040
Fuck!

180
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,419
This is the map
to the Indian reservation!

181
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,836
Sure it is!

182
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,255
I told you to switch this
with the map for blue team!

183
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,592
You told me switch the map.
Switch the map.

184
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,218
So I switched it and I switched.

185
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:02,101
My name is Nathan.
I'm disabled.

186
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,070
Hey, everybody.

187
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,823
Let's all go
to the office supply store!

188
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,412


189
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:24,790


190
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,251
You must have one dusty computer.

191
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:29,461
Fuck you!
It's not illegal, bitch.

192
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:40,890
I feel like
I could conquer the world.

193
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:44,977
Towelie now inhales up to 2,000 cans
of computer duster a day.

194
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,899
It's like I'm walkin' on sunshine!

195
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:54,403
I really think this intervention
is Towelie's last chance.

196
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,615
Towelie!
Open the door!

197
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,535
Go away.
I'm walkin' on sunshine!

198
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,287
I gotta take you
somewhere really important.

199
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:07,124
Just let me walk
on the sunshine a little more.

200
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,757
All right.
In the surfing competition,

201
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:17,510
the red team
is up three points to two!

202
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,887
And now, it's Jimmy Valmer's turn!

203
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,852
Gee, I wish our team captain
was as awesome as Jimmy!

204
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,649
I finally got it.

205
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:35,236
I got a way we can get rid
of Jimmy once and for all.

206
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:38,030
Oh boy!
What'll we do to him?

207
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:40,783
Simple.
We'll get Jimmy eaten by a shark.

208
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,953
Here, take this.
It's a shark mating whistle.

209
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,330
Okay, a shark mating whistle!

210
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:49,875
- We'll hit him over the head wid it?
- No, you moron.

211
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,336
You go under the water
and blow that whistle.

212
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:55,380
You can attract sharks,
right as Jimmy starts to surf.

213
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,634


214
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:03,472


215
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:04,932
I got it!

216
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,643
I blow the whistle and make the shark
come and bite Jimmy's legs off!

217
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:09,895
Then he'll bleed ta deat!
He's gonna bleed ta deat!

218
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:14,483
Are you boys enjoying the fun beach?

219
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:17,987
Yes, counselor Steve.
The beach is warm.

220
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,033
Gee, dat was a close one, huh?

221
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,285
They almost hoid me sayin'
we was gonna kill Jimmy!

222
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,412
Shut up!

223
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:30,458
Just swim in the water where Jimmy is,
then blow that whistle.

224
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,584
Oh boy!

225
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:38,215
I dunno, Timmy.
Those waves are pretty big.

226
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,886
Don't worry,
Jimmy can handle himself!

227
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,014
Gonna catch a wave.

228
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,146
I got me a shark whistle!

229
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,151
Oh boy, here it comes!

230
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,241
Wait, look.
He's doing it!

231
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,346
Oh boy!

232
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,431
You didn't do what I told you!

233
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,226
Whatdya mean?
You said to swim and blow the whistle.

234
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,603
I swam in the water,
so now I gonna blow the whistle.

235
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,857


236
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:40,069


237
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,322
You fucking idiot!

238
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,535
You don't blow
a shark mating whistle on dry land!

239
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,703
You were supposed to blow it...

240
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:54,291


241
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,670


242
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:02,424
Get this thing off me!

243
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,471
Today is Towelie's intervention.
We have no idea how he's gonna react.

244
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,557
Come on, it's right over here.

245
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:13,644


246
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,360
What's going on?

247
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,488
You wanna have a seat
with your friends?

248
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,325
What is everybody doing here?

249
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,327
We've all just been talking.

250
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:33,288
What I'm hearing is a bunch of people
who just love the heck out of ya.

251
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:35,207
They'll say what they wanna say,

252
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:37,334
you'll say what you wanna say,
and we're done.

253
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,463
Towelie, over the past couple years,

254
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:43,507
I have seen drug addiction
affect you in the following ways...

255
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,133
Jesus, man!

256
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,344
Towelie, you need to let him finish.

257
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,347
You're not the towel you used to be.

258
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:53,476
Where as you used to be
fluffy and absorbent,

259
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,185
you now are crusty

260
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:58,314
and unable to absorb
the smallest amount of water.

261
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,357
Will you get help today?

262
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,943
I don't get this.

263
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:07,364
Towelie, over the past few months,

264
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:10,993
I've watched you go from an ancillary
character with amusing catch phrases

265
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:14,204
to a dried-out spewge-rag covered
in the jiz of a thousand older men.

266
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:15,664
Can we just end this?

267
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,999
You have to let him finish.

268
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,712
If you refuse treatment, I won't
give you more money or be your friend.

269
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,631
I will not help you kill yourself.

270
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,841
All right, Eric.
Do you want to go next?

271
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,970
Kyle, I hate you so much.

272
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,514
You are a liar and a swindler
who will do anything for money...

273
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,432
We're here for Towelie, fat ass!

274
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,560
I'm supposed
to be allowed to finish, right?

275
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:40,022
The Jews have been persecuted
across the earth for good reason.

276
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:43,150
You are a race
of beady-eyed thieves, who...

277
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:46,654
- This is serious, you fucking asshole!
- I'm being serious!

278
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:50,282
We have to let people
finish during interventions.

279
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,367
But he's just using
his time on television to...

280
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,536
Please, it is not your turn.

281
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,916
You are a race
of beady-eyed thieves,

282
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,168
who throughout the millennia,
have worked your way

283
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,128
into the dark cubbyholes of society.

284
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,258
Where did the Jews
first get their power

285
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,593
and how are they able
to manipulate our minds today?

286
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:10,761
My God!

287
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:15,182


288
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,020
<i>It's a snap at Tardicaca Camp</i>

289
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:22,147
<i>to learn to do the hula hula dance</i>

290
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,525
<i>I fell in love with a Tardicaca dove</i>

291
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,235
<i>while doin' that funny funny dance</i>

292
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,069
<i>And that poor little kid...</i>

293
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,865
Get ready.
Blue team is about to go boom.

294
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:35,035


295
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,081


296
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,750
<i>So I made up my mind
that I've just got to find</i>

297
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,293
<i>the Tardicaca girl I did adore</i>

298
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,714
<i>A little Tardicaca</i>

299
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:48,632
<i>She's a candy cane to wiggle</i>

300
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,551
<i>She's sure to make you giggle</i>

301
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,220
<i>With her naughty little wiggle
I know some day</i>

302
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:56,765
<i>I'm gonna try to make
that Tardicaca gally mine gally mine</i>

303
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,767
<i>'cause all the while
I'm dreamin' of her</i>

304
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:00,644
<i>My Tardicaca Hula Gal</i>

305
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,940
Sorry. That's not right.
Hang on.

306
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:13,157
I don't tink he's playin' da right note.
The C4 ain't gonna go off!

307
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,075
Shut up!

308
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,329
If in fact the Jews
truly are shapeshifters,

309
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,958
and I believe I have presented
enough evidence to prove it,

310
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,502
we must unite
as a species to fight them

311
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,421
and stop their plan
of global domination

312
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,048
and the control of our freedom.

313
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,594
You want to go next?

314
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,973
Towelie, if you do not go to treatment,
we will all ignore you forever.

315
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,015
Will you go?

316
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:42,060
What treatment?
What are you all talking about?

317
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:45,272
If you say yes, we leave here,
pack your things, get on a plane,

318
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,108
go to a facility in Southern California
that's all set up.

319
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:51,904
Fuck, no!
I'm not getting on a fucking plane!

320
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,197
This is bullshit!

321
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,616
Don't give me fucking ultimatums!

322
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,868
I thought
you were my fucking friends!

323
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,705
Your friends don't want
to watch you kill yourself anymore.

324
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:05,000
Then fuck them!
You're telling me I have to do this...

325
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,252
I'm not left with any decisions!

326
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:08,545
Towelie!

327
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:13,092
We aren't the only ones
who've been hurt by you!

328
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,219
Who are you talking about?

329
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,476
Washcloth?
You brought Washcloth?

330
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,645
That's low!

331
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:27,314
<i>Out on the beach
with my dear little peach</i>

332
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,482
<i>where the waves rolling in so high</i>

333
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,276
Dammit!

334
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:34,488


335
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,407


336
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:41,954
Go demand the ukulele solo.
It's our only chance!

337
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,330
Okay!

338
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:46,500
<i>If you get in a pinch
go through it's a cinch</i>

339
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,502
We want the ukulele solo!

340
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,462
We want da ukulele solo!

341
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:52,798
Sorry, I just can't remember it.

342
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:55,049
We wants ya to play it, don't we?

343
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,929
All right, maybe you can
show me how it's done.

344
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,725
It's real easy.
You just play like dis!

345
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,397
You idiot!
What are you doing?

346
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,607
I was gonna show him
how ta play the solo.

347
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:14,028
That does it.
I'm sick and tired of your stupidity!

348
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,530
You are the biggest idiot
I have ever met.

349
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,741
And from now on,
if I wanna do something,

350
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,325
I'm gonna do it myself!

351
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,917


352
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:32,462


353
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,435
Not the shark again!

354
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,483
Washcloth!

355
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,901
I'm so sorry!

356
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:57,321
He needs you to get better, please!

357
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:00,324
You got so many people
that just love the heck out of ya.

358
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,451
All right!

359
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:04,620
I'll go!

360
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,455
You will?

361
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,708
I don't want to hurt
Washcloth anymore!

362
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,419
He's going, everybody!
Come on! Hugs!

363
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:23,764
Poor wed team.
Their Captain weawy got waped.

364
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,725
I never seen a kid
get screwed by a shark before.

365
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,561
I hope I never see it again.

366
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,522
Nathan, your team put up
an amazing fight.

367
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,525
Even though I was crowned
king of the camp,

368
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,319
I want you to know that you
were the real champ.

369
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,655
I hate you.

370
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,491
I fucking hate you
with everything in my entire being.

371
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:45,994
You sure got it
stuck it to ya this year!

372
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,246
Shut up...

373
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:54,378


374
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,213


375
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:03,387
- Hi, Towelie?
- Yeah, hi.

376
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:08,433
Towelie is definitely the most
addicted towels we've ever seen here.

377
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:12,604
He's the second most psychologically
damaged towel I've come across

378
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:16,191
since treating Christine Ali's towel,
which had seen...

379
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,484
some nasty stuff.

380
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,738
<i>I don't know
what tomorrow's gonna bring.</i>

381
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,241
<i>But I'm learning to love what I am.</i>

382
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,410
<i>I'm a towel.</i>

383
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:31,248


384
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:35,502


385
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,839


386
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,383
