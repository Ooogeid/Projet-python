Correct.

11

We talked about that ashtanga
class. I just thought...

00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,060
- It's great. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

13
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,420
10 bucks says you don't get this one.

14
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,090
You're on. 10 bucks.

15

00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,890

Okay. What is it?

28
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,660
It's a... Mid to high-end bottle of...

29
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:34,530
Wine. Oh,no,no,no,no,no. Champagne.

30
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:37,440
- Yes.
- There we go.

31
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,340
Regift?

32
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,300
It's a really good
bottle,and i don't drk.

33
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,710
- Let's have some cake.
- Okay.

34
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,030
What about your gift?

35
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,080
It's on its way.

36
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,320
Typical.

37
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,680
You really think that i would
forget your birthday present?

38
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:57,090
- Van pelt.
- It's on its way.

39
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,370
Yeah,right.

40
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,710
A little grumpy 'cause
daddy didn't buy you a pony?

41
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,570
Boss,we got a call.

42
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:08,710
He was found this
morning by some hikers.

43
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,620
Looks like *****

44
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,440
gunshot to the forehead.

45
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,050
There's no i.d.

46
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,190
This is all we found on him.

47
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,280
A straw tube and a...

48
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,510
I don't know,religious medal?

49
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,760
Or a good luck charm,maybe.

50
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,290
It didn't work too wellrif it was.

51
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,220
Our victim worked in a video game arcade
in the next big town to the north of here.

52
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,410
How'd you get that?

53
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,190
There was a big storm here
last week,wasn't there?

54
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:34,510
Yeah,a lot of rain. 4 inchespof
snow up in the mountains.

55
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,900
When the river rises,this
spot must be underwater.

56
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,150
So he must have been brought down here from
somewhere upriver and got caught in the tree.

57
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,160
Okay,but what about the arcade?

58
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:45,250
Well,this is a token
used for video games.

59
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,510
And this is a peruvian finger cuff.

60
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,850
They give 'em away as cheap prizes.

61
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,960
Our man looks a little old to be
hanging out in a video game arcade...

62
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,170
Unless he's into kids.

63
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,720
He doesn't look the type.

64
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,010
I bet he works in one.

65
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,280
We find the arcade,we
find the information.

66
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,920
What's the next big town upriver?

67
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,150
Sierra vista.

68
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,160
Okay,it's a theory. We're
done. He's all yours.

69
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:14,530
Uh,do ietect a slight residue
of grumpiness in your demeanor?

70
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,890
No.

71
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,000
I swear to you,lisbon,your
gift is on its way.

72
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:22,370
Uh,i'm not grumpy,and i don't give
a damn about your supposed gift.

73
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,780
She's still grumpy with me,isn't she?

74
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,050
Not touching that.

79
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,160
This is the only arcade in town.

80
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,390
And only a couple milesvfrom the river.

81
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,130
Gasoline,cheese,mesquite. It's
wonderful. This is the place.

82
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,050
Yeah,we'll see.

83
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,090
Hey,you got a dollar on you?

84
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,680
I'll give it right back to you.

85
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:33,150
Bingo.

86
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,880
Okay. You're right.

87
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,890
Here you go. Have fun.

88
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,320
That's ed didrikson.

89
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,510
He's been working for
me about two years.

90
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,440
- Okay.
- What happened?

91
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,470
Somebody killed him.

92
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,430
Can you think of why that would happen?

93
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:05,290
No,he kept to himself mostly.

94
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,250
No trouble. No trouble at all.

95
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,110
An honest,reliable,married
man-type guy.

96
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:11,040
Wife's name?

97
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,440
Uh,don't recall.

98
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:15,020
Uh,uh,karen,carol,somethin' like that.

99
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,110
And what was his position here,exactly?

100
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,610
Shift manager. He ran the
till,kept the kids in line.

101
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,560
He was good at that. It's
a responsible position.

102
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,320
Any money go missing lately?

103
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,420
Nope. And i keep tabs,trust me.

104
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,700
And why should we trust you?

105
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:32,310
Uh,i-it's just a
phrase,uh,like,"you know?"

106
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,540
What do i know?

107
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,490
No,uh,uh,you don't know anything.

108
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,300
Uh,i'm saying,it's just a thing to say.

109
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,300
Oh,it's a figure of speech.

110
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,890
So i shouldn't trust you,really.

111
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,460
Yeah--no,you
should.

112
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,820
When was the last
time you saw didrikson?

113
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,830
Friday night when he left work. Uh,he
didn't show up for work next day.

114
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,720
Uh,i called his home.
First there was no answer.

115
00:05:54,730 --> 00:06:00,970
Uh,the next day,uh,h-his wife was there,said
he was away on a-a family emergency.

116
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,350
Doesn't know when he'll be back.

117
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,480
An emergency?

118
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,620
That's all she said.

119
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,290
How was her tone?

120
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,940
Was she calm or was she... Upset?

121
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,030
Upset,i guess.

122
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,800
We'll need the home address.

123
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,360
Sure thing.

124
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,770
- Now...
- Right.

125
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,580
If you wouldn't mind.

126
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,710
- Ugh,kinda hard to trust the guy.
- Yep.

127
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,300
You and rigsby stay here. Talk to
the kids didrikson kept in line.

128
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,000
See if they have the
same take on the guy.

129
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,470
Cho,van pelt and i are
gonna go talk to the wife.

130
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,020
All right. Pwe'll see you later.

131
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,810
Bye.

132
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,350
Teenagers. I hate questioning
teenagers. It's like talking to mud.

133
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,500
You some love in your heart.

134
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,530
Oh,is that my problem?

135
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,140
Yeah,it is. Stay close.

136
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,390
Great.

137
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,410
Not bad. Not bad at all.

138
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,440
You want to see how
it's supposed to be done?

139
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,550
What are you,psex perverts or cops?

140
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:03,970
See what i mean?

141
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,340
Oh,he's a cop. I'm just
a concerned citizen.

142
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,500
All right,we--we got
nothing to say to you.

143
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,850
Yeah. Screw the cops.

144
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:15,300
Even for a midget villain like
yourself,that's an untenable ethical position.

145
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,030
Every modern society has
some kind of police force.

146
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:21,020
It's like saying,"screw the
public transport system."

147
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,650
Oh,thank you.

148
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,830
What'd you find out?

149
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:45,630
County tax collectors list the
owners as ed and jenny didrikson.

150
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:48,030
Moved here two years ago from texas.

151
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:51,920
No kids,no criminal records,not much
of anything as far as the data goes.

152
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,870
The only odd this is they paid
for the house in cash. No mortgage.

153
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,070
That's crazy. How'd you do that?

154
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,690
Focus. Watch as i make
this machine do my bidding.

155
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,420
Do exactly as i tell you.

156
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,220
You--take
over.

157
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,010
You... Come with me.

158
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,140
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

159
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,780
So...

160
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:59,560
Tell us what you know
about ed didrikson.

161
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:03,910
Eddie that works here?

162
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,030
I mean,eddie's a cool guy.

163
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,360
He'll hook you up if he knows you.

164
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,070
Hook you up? With what?

165
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,230
Uh,weed,you know?

166
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,970
- It's tiny's
stuff,but-- - tiny?

167
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,280
Yeah,he's a biker.
He rolls with the x's.

168
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:18,880
It's his stuff,same price,but he
doesn't mess with people like tiny does.

169
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,520
Or you could borrow money from m.

170
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,540
I mean,he charges a heavy
vig,but that's all right.

171
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,940
That's what
didriksonrcalls it--a vig?

172
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,920
Yeah. Did i say it right? Vig?

173
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,560
- I don't know. is he saying it wrong?
- No,no. That's right.

174
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,160
No,that's right.

175
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,220
Anything else you
could tell us about him?

176
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,330
He's alwaysptalking about respect.

177
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,530
He won't tolerate any kind of diss.

178
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,190
This one time,slow ritchie
gave him the finger.

179
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,320
He just reached out and broke it.

180
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,110
- You could hear the bone crack.
- Ouch.

181
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,200
Ritchie's on the floor screaming,and
did just looks at him real cold.

182
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,830
He cusses him out in french or
something and goes about his business.

183
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:48,810
In french?

184
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,120
I don't know. Something foreign.

185
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:52,390
Interesting.

186
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,870
Rdo you know he's dead?

187
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,330
- Eddie?
- Yeah.

188
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,470
No. What happened?

189
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,400
Thanks for your help.

190
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:05,060
You can go now.

191
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,750
Back door's locked as well.
Feels like a dead bolt.

192
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,930
Somebody's watching us
from the upstairs window.

193
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:26,540
Jenny didrikson? Cbi. Police.

194
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,380
Let us in. We'd like to speak with you.

195
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,540
We don't have time
to wait for a warrant.

196
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:41,090
But we do have reason to believe that
somebody's life is in danger. Right?

197
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,100
Mrs. Didrikson?

198
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,720
You get the hell out of my house
right now,you murdering scum.

199
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,560
I swear to god,i'll blow you away.

200
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,900
Mrs. Didrikson,i'm
gonna show you my badge.

201
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,510
I got people coming. You
better get out of here.

202
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,050
Mrs. Didrikson,we're with the
california bureau of investigation.

203
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,080
Put the gun down.

204
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:22,360
California bureau of my ass.

205
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,320
You get the hell outta
here. I will shoot you.

206
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,370
This is my cell phone.

207
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,780
I'm gonna dial 9-1-1,and we will
get uniformed policemen here,

208
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:33,100
And they will sort everything out.

209
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,540
In the meantime,we'll all relax.

210
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:40,540
Screw you! I'm gonna count to
ten,and then i'm gonna start shooting.

211
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,830
One... Two...

212
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,770
- Lisbon.
- Jane,get off the phone.

213
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,850
Three...

214
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,220
I think i know what we have here.

215
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,180
- Four...
- I've got a situation.

216
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:53,490
- Five,six...
- I think didrikson worked with the mob...

217
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,370
- Seven.
- That's why he's out here.

218
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,540
Eight...

219
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:00,290
Freeze! Freeze!

220
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,070
Drop your weapons.
Get down on the ground.

221
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,450
Put your hands on your heads!

222
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,680
Who are you people?

223
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,100
We're with the california
bureau of investigation.

224
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:18,120
I'm agent lisbon. These
are agents cho and van pelt.

225
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,940
We're u.s.marshals.

226
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,940
Yeah,we can see that.

227
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,120
Okay,fellas. Stand down.

228
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,330
Jenny? Jenny,it's us.

229
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,900
Sweetheart,put the gun down. It's okay.

230
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,520
It's all right.

231
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:41,660
Sorry,agent. I didn't mean
to scare you like that.

232
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,940
You know,we hear the bell,come running.

233
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,540
That's all right. We weren't scared.

234
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,260
No hard feelings,right?

235
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,540
Come on down,jenny. It's all right.

236
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,210
All right,so why are you
here? What did eddie do now?

237
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,260
He's dead.

238
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,200
Single shot to the forehead.

239
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,700
- We found him 50 miles downriver.
- Damn.

240
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,870
********

241
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,230
You didn't know he was missing,and
he was under your protection?

242
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,690
No,jenny informed us he
wasmissing three days ago.

243
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,790
He's been a.w.o.l.before. We just figured
he was out,another drunk or something.

244
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:20,160
You sons o' bitches! I told you they'd
get him! And i told you! You bastards!

245
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,610
Bastards.

246
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:29,170
What'd i miss?

247
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:33,580
Up until two years ago,ed didrikson
was eddie russo from philadelphia.

248
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,970
He ran numbers for
the battaglia family...

249
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,270
And loan sharking and collections.

250
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:41,000
And then he got caught with 10 kilos
of cocaine. The feds flipped him.

251
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:44,220
The guy actually testified against
santino battaglia and his family.

252
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:47,170
The old man didn't go
down,but,uh,two of his sons got life.

253
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:52,210
Russo and his wife moved down here under our
supervision with the witness relocation program.

254
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,820
So what do you thinkvhappened here?

255
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:54,940
What went wrong,do you think?

256
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,250
The same old story,i guess.

257
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,860
Pyou know,these people-- they can't
resist contacting somebody from back home--

258
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,340
From their old life-- and that
person tells somebody,and eventually,

259
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:04,340
Somebody sells him out
to santino battaglia.

260
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,480
You know,it happens.

261
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,640
Yeah,we tell themragain and again--
look,your old life is dead. It's gone.

262
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:12,260
Forget it,but,uh,they don't listen.

263
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:14,680
- So you people are witness protection?
- Yeah.

264
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:18,370
So that means you're
supposed to protect people?

265
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,980
We're not bodyguards,agent.
We don't babysit these people.

266
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,530
Consultant. She's the
agent. I'm the consultant.

267
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,230
- Agent.
- You were saying?

268
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,910
Consultant?

269
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,280
Okay.

270
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,670
We physically meet with
our clients once a week.

271
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,580
And our last scheduled
appointment with eddie was what,

272
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,520
- the day before he disappeared,right?
- Yeah.

273
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:37,550
And jenny told you he was
missing,and you did nothing?

274
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:39,960
What should we have
done? Alert the media?

275
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:43,810
We were looking for 'em,and like i said,it
wasn't the first time eddie had jumped the fence.

276
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,180
This isn't our fault.

277
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:47,380
Oh,did you know that
eddie was dealing drugs?

278
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:48,340
No.

279
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:51,100
Yeah,seing marijuana
and pills to children.

280
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,380
No. Where did you get that?

281
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,900
A kid down at the arcade
where eddie worked.

282
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:57,780
Said he was fronting for
a biker named... Tiny.

283
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,360
- You guys have been busy,huh?
- Yeah.

284
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:05,130
Just to be clear on this,you didn't
know about any criminal activities

285
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,830
the victim might have been engaged in?

286
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,820
Look,he was a made man,a mafioso.

287
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:11,070
It's not like he's gonna turn
around and join the church choir.

288
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,210
- So you didn't know?
- There's an adjustment period.

289
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,170
No,we didn't.

290
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,480
Pnor do we now,actually,and
you wanna know something?

291
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,750
This is starting to sound an
awful lot like an interrogation.

292
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:24,220
Not appreciated. We
have reports to write.

293
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:28,080
It was very nice to have met you.

294
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:36,200
Do you prefer gina or jenny?

295
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:39,480
Who gives a damn? Call me what you like.

296
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,790
Gina then.

297
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:44,040
When did you last see your husband?

298
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,990
It was last friday morning.

299
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,460
He never came home from work.

300
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:51,250
He called that afternoon,said he had some
business to do and that he was gonna be home late.

301
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,980
And that was the last
time i heard from him.

302
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,990
What kind of businessxwas that?

303
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,550
I don't know. Business. I didn't ask.

304
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,740
You didn't ask or you
didn't want to know?

305
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,780
Oh,i get it. He's a bad man,right?

306
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,130
He must have been doing something wrong.

307
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:08,020
He's out there raping and
killing people,must've--

308
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,830
Must've deserved what
he got. Is that it?

309
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,080
Gina.

310
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,770
What's he gonna do wrong in this place?

311
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,570
Vandalize a cactus?

312
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,630
You don't like it here?

313
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,610
You know what the
worst part is? The food.

314
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:25,110
They got no good red sauce,no sausage
and they put pineapple on their pizza.

315
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,810
Do you have any idea
who might have done this?

316
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,850
Who do you think?

317
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,110
It was that pig,sonny
battaglia,and his people.

318
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,220
They swore they would get
my husband,and now they have.

319
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,510
My husband did the rht thing,didn't he?

320
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,330
He did what his country asked him to do.

321
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:48,800
So why is it that they didn't take
care of us like they were supposed to?

322
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:53,310
Did you or your husband recently talk to anyone
from the old days,from your previous life?

323
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,200
No. What,are we idiots? No.

324
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:58,450
Who do you talk to?

325
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:03,120
Yeah,right. Who? I talk to no one.

326
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:05,630
The wind.

327
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:10,200
So how would the battaglias have
found out where you were located?

328
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:12,410
It was the marshals,of course.

329
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:16,200
Somebody paid one of those witsec
sons o' bitches to rat us out.

330
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:18,510
Gina,look at me.

331
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,680
Whoever did this-- we
will catch them. I promise.

332
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,290
Okay.

333
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,030
What'd you learn?

334
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:38,120
Oh,she's scared,she's of italian
descent,she bites her nails,

335
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,830
She doesn't like pets or pineapple.

336
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,360
Useful stuff.

337
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:44,440
Cho,reach out to the
organized crime unit.

338
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,710
Get a line on sonny battaglia.

339
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,540
Find out who's in charge,who they
might hire to do something like this.

340
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:53,940
You and rigsby go and
find tiny. Bring him in.

341
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:56,020
Do we know who he rides with?

342
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,010
Uh,the kids did say something
about him being with the x's.

343
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:03,110
I know a guy in san berdoo,has a
c.i.with him. We'll find tiny. No problem.

344
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,880
Hey,we're closed.

345
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,860
Is one of you tiny?

346
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,020
Who's askin'?

347
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:33,520
We're with the california
bureau of investigation.

348
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,320
Get out of here before i
call your parole officers.

349
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,410
- *********
- Sorry.Are you all right?

350
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,880
Yeah.

351
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:00,360
- ******
- **

352
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:08,950
You know,we just wanted to ask
you some questions. That's all.

353
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,510
I don't like cops.

354
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,700
Ed didrikson was found dea yesterday.

355
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,740
What do you know about that?

356
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,640
Who's ed didrikson?

357
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:19,270
You were in business with
ed. Dealing marijuana?

358
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,580

Mari--what?

359
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:22,430
Look,we just want to
find out who killed him.

360
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,790
Help us with that.

361
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:26,370
We don't care about
your other... Business.

362
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,610
Eddie was a rat.

363
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,550
Rats get dead.

364
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,830
Not by me. Not by me.

365
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,800
But it happens. Nobody likes rats.

366
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,860
He ratted you out?

367
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:45,570
A couple weeks back,eddie and me
were in his car doing business.

368
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:50,090
We got busted by sierra vista
p.d.,holding 10 pounds of weed.

369
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,090
I'm in the tank two days.

370
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,830
I go before the judge,and it's just me.

371
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,000
Eddie's gone,and i mean gone.

372
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,040
He's not even on the docket anymore.

373
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,880
He's off the original arrest report.

374
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,000
So what does that tell you?

375
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:05,770
Obviously he's a narc or a snitch.

376
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:10,240
And he's so well-connected,he don't
mind that i know that's what he is--

377
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,730
Dirty low-down scum.

378
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:19,840
That don't mean i killed him.

379
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:24,030
So sierra vista p.d.confirmed
that john "tiny" callahan

380
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:26,610
was arrested two weeks
ago on marijuana charges.

381
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,460
They say he was alone,not
with ed didrikson.

382
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,400
Don't know anything
about him,apparently.

383
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:34,160
What about the records forpthe
vehicle tiny was busted in?

384
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,090
No vehicle.

385
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,800
He was stopped on the street.

386
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,650
Walking aroundpwith
10 pounds of marijuana?

387
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,640
That's what the sierra vista
p.d.police chief says,yeah.

388
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,920
What'd he sound likevwhen he said it?

389
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,650
Like he was covering for
some other guy's mess.

390
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,450
So we need to speakpto
those marshals again.

391
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,380
I'm gonna make that call.

392
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,160
Any word on sonny battaglia?

393
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:52,050
After his two sons went to
prison,sonny battaglia retired,

394
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,890
Left the family business to
his number two,joseph angelini.

395
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,860
So angelini would only want to
send eddie russo his best wishes.

396
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,530
It's battaglia who would want him dead.

397
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,860
He's outpof the business,pushing 70.

398
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,480
Plays a lot of golf in palm desert.

399
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,500
Some people say he's not really retired,

400
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,850
that he's just playing it that
way to keep his hands clean.

401
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,420
Palm desert right hererin california?

402
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:12,150
No.

403
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,590
Palm desert's not in california?

404
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,520
No,you can't sneak off and try
and talk to sonny battaglia.

405
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,080
I thought you meant palm
desert wasn't in california.

406
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:22,060
It is in california,right?

407
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:28,060
<i>*******</i>

408
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,360
Excuse me!

409
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,100
Sonny battaglia?

410
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,530
Keep moving,jack.

411
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:46,150
Name's jane. Patrick jane.

412
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,760
I need a moment of your time,if i may.

413
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,210
For what?

414
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:53,210
Speak about eddie russo.

415
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:58,040
- You a cop?
- No.

416
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:01,810
Good. You alone?

417
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:07,680
- Yeah.
- Shoot him.

418
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,840
There's three reasons i'm not scared.

419
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:25,590
Well,okay,i'm scared,but there's
three reasons i'm not terrified.

420
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,310
Please tell.

421
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:32,870
One--you don't get to be your age,rich and unimprisoned
by shooting people willy-nilly on golf courses.

422
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,030
Until now.

423
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,090
You know what consistency is?

424
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,230
Thhobgoblin of little minds?

425
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,170
Right. Emerson.

426
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,140
Okay. Reason number two?

427
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:48,740
I can significantly
improve your golf game.

428
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,390
You and a hundred other baccal s.

429
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:52,820
Reason number three?

430
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,490
I know where to find eddie russo.

431
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:04,030
How do i improve my game?

432
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,120
Well,it's very simple. It's easy.

433
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:08,290
You have to ink of hitting the
ball more as,uh,an act of creation.

434
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,390
What you need is a little more flow.

435
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,330
Flow?

436
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,010
- I changed my mind. Shoot him.
- What's your favorite song?

437
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,600
You're the smart ass. You tell me.

438
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:22,030
Its either elvis,sinatra or italian ora.

439
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:25,200
Enrico caruso singing "santa lucia."

440
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:28,050
Perfect. Could you hand me one of
those sticks,and we'll get started?

441
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,770
- Sticks?
- Whatever you call 'em.

442
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,060
Not the fat one. Get
the--the other kind.

443
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,300
Okay,well,that's a little
fat,but i'll make it work.

444
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,420
Flow.

445
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,800
- Thanks for coming.
- what's the deal?

446
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:46,070
We don't have much time.

447
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,720
Why don't you have a seat
in my office? It's quieter.

448
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:49,520
All right.

449
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:52,790
- You remember agent cho.
- How you doin'?

450
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:58,190
I won't beat around the bush.

451
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:01,690
Two weeks ago,did you get eddie
russo off the hook for a drug bust?

452
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,900
No,we did not.

453
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:08,030
Well,somebody did,d it made his
accomplice very angry at him.

454
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,480
Why would we do that?

455
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,900
Maybe you had a deal with russo.

456
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:14,690
He gets to deal drugs or what have you,and
you look the other way or maybe even help him,

457
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,340
As long as he keeps helping
the feds with their thing.

458
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:21,110
Let me explain the real
worldtto you,teresa.

459
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,030
Russo's been squeezed dry of testimony.

460
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,610
Federal prosecutors
don't need him anymore.

461
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:28,440
They don't care what happens
to him and neither do we.

462
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:32,080
He gets busted,that's his
problem,and it's less work for us.

463
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:37,980
So either the local cops were in
business with eddie or my guess--

464
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,540
You're just as misinformed as
you are disrespectful and dumb.

465
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,540
Bye now.

466
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,700
- Seems dirty,doesn't he?
- Yep.

467
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:57,720
Why don't you check with i.a.about him
and his partner? See if anything pops.

468
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,260
Where's jane?

469
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:06,000
Don't get mad,but i have a feeling
he went down to talk to battaglia.

470
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,530
Damn it.

471
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,170
Should one of us head down
to palm desert just in case?

472
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,650
He made his bed.

473
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,270
* Santa lucia

474
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:23,370
* Santa lucia

475
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:27,520
* Santa luci...

476
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,060
I should've shot you
myself when you showed up.

477
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:37,310
* Santa lucia

478
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,880
all the hours i spent
on this course,huh?

479
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:48,060
The thousands i wasted on
videotapes and coaching.

480
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:51,760
And blondie here,he does it with
singing. How do youike at,huh?

481
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:54,670
I'm just polishing the
talent that was already there.

482
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,910
Yeah,yeah.

483
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:02,880
So now tell me,my strange new
friend,where's eddie russo?

484
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,550
- You didn't know?
- Know what?

485
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:10,100
Eddie russo's dead.

486
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,920
No kidding.

487
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:14,530
Killed a couple days ago.

488
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,710
He's in the state morgue in sacramento
under the name of ed didrikson.

489
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,540
Who did it?

490
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:23,710
You don't know? Interesting.

491
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,430
Who did it?

492
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:26,860
I don't know.

493
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:34,000
- Today is a good day.
- Good.

494
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:37,240
Listen,if you ever find out who
killed eddie,you call me,okay?

495
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:41,020
'Cause i want to send whoever did
it some flowers and a thank you note.

496
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:43,290
Sure,sure. What's your number?

497
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,960
What are you doin'? Don't
give him your number.

498
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:50,650
This guy? What is he gonna do?

499
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:53,350
Here. It's a clean line. You can talk.

500
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,050
Thank you.

501
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:58,220
So if you didn't do it,then who would
have done it? Who was next in line?

502
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,230
An angry husband,most likely.

503
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:03,370
Eddie was a degenerate skirt hound.

504
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,890
Is that right?

505
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,410
An animal,compulsive.

506
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:10,400
Tell me,uh,how was it done?
How did they do it to him?

507
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:13,770
Oh,uh,i can assure you he didn't suffer.

508
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,190
But thanks for your time,mr.
Battaglia. See you later.

509
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,050
Hey,wait a minute. I'm not
finished talking with you yet.

510
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,560
Well,i'm finished talking with you.

511
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,480
Hey,what are you,al
pacino all of a sudden?

512
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:24,320
People don't act that way with me.

513
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:26,920
I do when there's witnesses around.

514
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,680
What am i gonna do with this
guy? He's got a screw loose.

515
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,960
You know,you ink you have a
certain outlaw charm about you,

516
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:34,560
And you do,but you live by oppression.

517
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:37,840
In reality,you're just a
greedy,twisted little sadist.

518
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,410
Hey,screw you,blondie.

519
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:43,440
You're lucky you helped me
beat arnold palmer here,huh?

520
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:46,590
Or i'd plug you right now.
The hell with the witnesses!

521
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,450
Screw you.

522
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:54,030
You played golf with sonny battaglia?

523
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:58,750
Yeah. Sonny,uh... Well,i did,mm-hmm.

524
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:00,970
And what did you learn?

525
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,870
He didn't kill russo,and
golf is,oddly,very easy.

526
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,550
And you're sure of this?

527
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:08,620
I'm very sure. It's all about
rhythm. Anyone could do it.

528
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,970
Yeah,sonny battaglia's
clean,at least i think.

529
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,330
It's hard to say with a sociopath.

530
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:15,310
That doesn't mean that some other
mafioso didn't do it,of course.

531
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,170
Sonny thinks it was an ex-lover.

532
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:20,120
You know,the key is who sprung eddie from that
charge,and i'm betting it's those marshals.

533
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:22,750
Which means we're gonna have to accuse
the sierra vista p.d.of double-dealing.

534
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:23,940
Hmm,that should be fun.

535
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:26,970
A vehicle registered to ed
didrikson just entered the system.

536
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:29,650
It was towed from the lot outside
house of games monday morning.

537
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,440
Sierra vista p.d.couldn't
find their ass in the dark.

538
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,750
So if russo's car was still
parked outside house of games,

539
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,320
That means somebody
must have picked him up.

540
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:39,040
Maybe the arcade security cameras
have a picture of who it was.

541
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:41,230
- Why don't you two find out?
- Right.

542
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:45,750
Yeah,you guys go find
out. I'll find the couch.

543
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:48,180
Oh,there it is.

544
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:50,110
We need to look at your security tapes.

545
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,220
Tapes? Iave no tapes.

546
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,840
You have cameras.

547
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:57,460
Of course,but only the little red
light works. That's all you need.

548
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:00,640
What are you guys looking for
anyhow? Nothing happened here.

549
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:02,240
We want to know who picked up russo.

550
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:04,210
I can tell you that.
His wife picked him up.

551
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,760
I saw her in the parking lot.

552
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:07,000
- His wife?
- Yeah.

553
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:08,660
- You sure it was her?
- Sure.

554
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,300
I-i mean,i assume it was her.

555
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:13,160
She's cked him up a couple times before.

556
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,870
Brunette,slim,maybe 5'4"?

557
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,220
No. A pretty black lady about 5'10".

558
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,650
Boss,we're gonna need to speak to
marshal knox about a few things.

559
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:33,610
What do you people think you're
playing at? Who's your supervisor?

560
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:36,360
i want some answers right now.

561
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:37,240
Uh,lisbon?

562
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,500
I'm gonna make sure you regret
that you ever screwed with me,pal.

563
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:41,830
- I'm not even a cop.
- Hello,marshal exley.

564
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,450
I just got a call from my
supervisor telling me that

565
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:48,600
you put in an official request to question marshal
knox as a person of interest in the russo case.

566
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:51,210
- Yes.
- It's all over the department.

567
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,690
Why are you trying to ruin her?

568
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:56,420
Did you know she was with russo on
friday night,the night he vanished?

569
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:59,450
So you're saying that she fingered
him,that she set him up for the mob?

570
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:03,100
- Well,it certainly looks that way.
- No. That's garbage. It's absurd.

571
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:05,020
- I would have known.
- Just saying.

572
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,490
She's my partner,for god's sake.

573
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:08,540
I would know if she wasn't straight.

574
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,100
We confirmed with the sierra vista p.d.

575
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,550
The night that russo got arrested,knox
came in and had them drop the charges

576
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:17,860
As if she was doing it on
behalf of the marsh service.

577
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:18,930
Why would she do that?

578
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,530
Well,ere's no usein fingering russo
if he's locked up safe in prison.

579
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,780
No,this is a mistake.
There's some explanation.

580
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:32,020
Then why can't we find
her to hear her say that?

581
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,540
I don't know.

582
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:36,430
Do you know where she is now?

583
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,280
No.

584
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,090
All right then.

585
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,770
Ma'am?

586
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,460
Hello?

587
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:17,100
She's hardly breathing.
Better call it in.

588
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:22,160
2 alpha 44,i need fire andescue to roll
code 3 to the 500 block of lexington,

589
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:24,380
attempt suicide.

590
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:26,730
Got it. Thks.

591
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:29,760
She's at county general.

592
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,240
They're pumping her stomach now.

593
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,350
Is she gonna be okay?

594
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,550
Well,they don't know what she took
or how much,so it's too early to tell.

595
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,980
- But looks like she's gonna make it.
- Okay.

596
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:41,690
I'm gonna go see her.

597
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,860
Wait. W-we'll come with.

598
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:46,430
No,that's all right.
I-i can handle this.

599
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,120
I respect your distress.
She's your partner.

600
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:51,920
But please understand
our situation here.

601
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:55,190
We've got a case to run,and
she's still a person of interest.

602
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,490
We need to speak to her.

603
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,290
Okay,i understand. You got a job to do.

604
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,480
Oh,here's
a thought--

605
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:04,630
- what if you did it?
- Me? What?

606
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,140
Sure. Knox wasn't setting
up russo with the mob.

607
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:10,230
She was meeting him that night
because they were having an affair.

608
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:12,300
- Yeah,that makes sense.
- It does,doesn't it?

609
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,570
You're out of your mind.

610
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,860
That lowlife crook in
bed with your christy?

611
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,210
And don't try to tell us you
don't have a secret crush on her.

612
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,210
- That's crap,pal.
- You see the anger?

613
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:24,340
The sort of scandal that could
screw up your career along with hers.

614
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:27,430
I mean,i understand. Any man in
your position would want to kill him.

615
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,480
That's enough.

616
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,110
Oh,i'm not saying that
you knew about the affair.

617
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:37,370
I'm just saying that if you
did,you'd be our primeuspect.

618
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:42,630
It's funny,really. Your best defense is your
apparent lack of the most basic detective skills.

619
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,770
- Oh,you little son of a bitch.
- Easy.

620
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:47,560
Hey,i'm sorry. I'm just
thinking out loud. No offense.

621
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:51,160
- You're right. No offense.
- None taken.

622
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:58,490
Well,you certainly pushed
his button didn't you?

623
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,510
Cho,come to the hospital with me.

624
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:02,870
You two talk to gina russo.

625
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:05,190
Find out what she thinks about all this.

626
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:09,360
Try and behave yourself.

627
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,470
I'll do my best.

628
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:15,170
- Can i see your phone? - Do
you think he did it--exley?

629
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,510
I don't know. Do you think he did?

630
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,380
Well,if there was an affair,he
had motive,like you say.

631
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,110
Yeah,if.

632
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:24,140
And he did didn't respond
well to being prodded.

633
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,580
Nobody does.

634
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,250
When someone answers,can
you say,"is mary there?"

635
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,280
- Why?
- Just for fun.

636
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,230
Santa lucia!

637
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,250
Is,um,is mary there?

638
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,510
No,lady,it's the wrong number.

639
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,570
- Wrong number. What was that about?
- Groundwork.

640
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,550
Can i have a look at your phone?

641
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:50,320
Here,hold these.

642
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:53,800
Try 'em on.

643
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,340
They look good.

644
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:58,240
Do you
have,uh,whatchamacallit--

645
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:01,990
- Uh,warm-up gear,training
sweats,shiny type? - No. Yeah.

646
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,780
- Where are you going with this?
- Ask to speak to mary.

647
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,480
Oh,i don't like this.

648
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:08,330
- Can i speak to mary,please?
- No.

649
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,150
- What did they say?
- "no."

650
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,660
- Who was that?
- Just an old friend.

651
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:14,720
- Where's your sweat gear?
- Uh, in my locker.

652
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:16,160
All right, let's go.

653
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:19,380
Jane?

654
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,310
Here we go.

655
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:40,190
Okay, but i'd feel better
if lisbon knew about this.

656
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:42,200
Then tell her.

657
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:44,100
You know what to do, right?

658
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:46,500
You just stay for a few minutes
until she gets comfortable,

659
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,750
and then when rigsby calls, you leave.

660
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,960
What's my reason for leaving?

661
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:52,810
Oh,it doesn't matter. Something
to do wi work. Just be vague.

662
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,580
Rigsby's right,you know.

663
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,550
Lisbon told us to go see gina russo.

664
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:59,380
She told you to stay out of trouble.

665
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:01,000
Sonny,hi. Patrick jane.

666
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:06,110
Oh,yeah,you. Okay,you got a name for me?

667
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,940
Uh,no. Not yet. Maybe
soon. Never mind about that.

668
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:12,360
Mary wants to know,has anyone
left any messages for her?

669
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,890
Are you crazy?

670
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,920
Listen,u little jerk.

671
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:18,670
I will tear your freakin' head off
and stick it where the sun don't--

672
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,760
You gotta talk to the marshals for me.

673
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:23,670
I want to know when i'm gonna get moved.

674
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,610
Uh,that's not really
our purview,but--

675
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,880
Thank you. I'd appreciate it.

676
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,600
What's he doing?

677
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:36,190
Oh, uh, you said you can't
get any good food out here,

678
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:39,670
So, uh, i thought i'd
come by and cook you some.

679
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,730
if you want to help,you can chop these.

680
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,660
Okay.

681
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,600
Do you have an apron?

682
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,550
I can't imagine be stuck out here
in the desert alone with the coyotes

683
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:07,820
And the tumbleweeds anthe bad red sauce.

684
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,560
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

685
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:12,940
Out here,you're all alone.

686
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:16,310
When you said you were homesick,eddie
probably told you to make friends,

687
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,830
Join a gym or something,right?

688
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,790
Yoga,he says.

689
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,720
Yoga.

690
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:25,110
'Cause standing on your head listening
to flute music is definitely the answer.

691
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,810
Yeah. Okay,got it.

692
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:36,680
I gotta go do something. Work.

693
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:39,100
Well,come back quick.
We'll still be here.

694
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:41,260
All right,great.

695
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:48,050
- Mm,that was good.
- Not bad at all.

696
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:51,260
- Salute.
- Salute.

697
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:05,000
gina,we believe that eddie was having a romantic
relationship with christy knox from the witsec program.

698
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,130
Romantic?

699
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:12,130
With the marshal lady? Are you
kidding? No. Never happen. No.

700
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,400
Why are you so sure?

701
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:17,950
Eddie liked the ladies,right?
Didn't he? Womanizer. Famous for it.

702
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,940
Yeah,maybe in his old
life,but he changed.

703
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,740
Changed? Really?

704
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,800
You believe th people
can change who they are?

705
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,960
Yeah,sure. People can change.

706
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:28,220
Eddie couldn't change. No.

707
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:33,290
He used to be somebody. Now
he's got to be nobody. No.

708
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:36,800
Even after he dragged you all the
way out here to the middle of nowhere,

709
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:41,210
There's still some nights he
doesn't come home,just like before.

710
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:47,340
Before you can move on,gina,you
gotta make things right now.

711
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:49,360
Tell me the truth.

712
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:50,820
I'm not sayin' nothin'.

713
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:53,610
You found out he was cheating.
You snapped,and you shot him.

714
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:56,770
You can say whatever you like. It
means nothing. You have to prove it.

715
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,420
Where did you do it?

716
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:01,090
What happened to the gun that you used?

717
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:04,710
You want some coffee? Dessert?

718
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:07,610
No,thanks.

719
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:09,750
The reason i'm
here alone--

720
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,840
My colleagues are kind
of straight arrows.

721
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,870
I don't want 'em getting mixed
up in anything,you know,sketchy.

722
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,990
What sketchy?

723
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,710
I went to talk to sonny battaglia.

724
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,420
Impressive man. Knows
how to get what he wants.

725
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,920
He's a vicious scumbag.

726
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:32,150
Yeah,he is. Didn't speak
too well of you,either.

727
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,220
Seems to think it was you that encouraged
eddie to rat in the first place.

728
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:39,600
- That's not true.
- It's what he thinks.

729
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:44,150
And you know what he's like once he
gets that idea in his head-- stubborn.

730
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,370
He offered me a very sweet deal.

731
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:49,030
What kind of a deal?

732
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:51,790
- What kind of deal do you think?
- You tell me.

733
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:56,450
You can either make me look good with
the cops and confess to what you've done,

734
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:00,190
Or you can make me look
good with sonny battaglia...

735
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,440
And die.

736
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:04,280
That's your choice.

737
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:09,730
Die? You're a cop.

738
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:13,440
And cops never bend the law,do they?

739
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:17,270
Besides,i'm not even really a cop.

740
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,920
I'm just a consultant...

741
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:23,540
Lookin' out for number one.

742
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,960
You better make up your mind.

743
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:28,510
Battaglia's man is on his way.

744
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,450
I don't believe you.

745
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:32,370
Well,i'll call sonny and
have him tell you himself.

746
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:34,810
You remember h voice,don't you?

747
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:38,250
Don't you?

748
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,740
- Yeah.
- Hey,sonny.

749
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:41,500
- ***
- Yeah,it's me again.

750
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:42,870
*******

751
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,460
You remember that woman we were
talking about? Well,she's right here.

752
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:47,860
Listen,you piece
of dirt,you dog--

753
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:50,830
yeah,sure.I'll put her on.

754
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,790
- Hello?
- You are dead! Do you hear me?

755
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,770
I am gonna rip off your
head and chew on your spine!

756
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:05,270
Nobody screws around with
me and lives! You hear me?

757
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:08,430
So what's it gonna be,gina?

758
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,270
Confess or die?

759
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:14,590
- You can't do this.
- Oh,i'm doin' it.

760
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,540
Oh,he's here. Faster than i thought.

761
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:34,970
There's no guns in the house.
The police have taken 'em all.

762
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:37,920
It's either him or me,gina.

763
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:42,370
All right. All right. I
did it,okay? I killed eddie.

764
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,050
Good. Tell me the details.

765
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,820
You tell him to stop. Stop him!

766
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:48,000
Details.

767
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:51,850
I followed them from work
on friday night. All right?

768
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,160
I watched them go to a motel.

769
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:57,010
Afterwards,she drove him back to
his car. There was no one around.

770
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:59,620
I shot him.

771
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:03,070
And then--and then i drove his body to
a bridge,and i dumped it over the edge.

772
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:06,330
Perfect,thank you. Agent
rigsby,arrest this woman.

773
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:11,760
Put your hands behind your back.

774
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:21,740
Lookin' good,sport. Lookin' good.

775
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:28,080
Knox wanted to apologize to you personally,but
she's,uh,she's still in the hospital.

776
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,660
What is she gonna do now?

777
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,040
Well,she's out of the
marshal service,of course.

778
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:36,060
Um,she's just gonna take
some time off,see what's next.

779
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:40,750
And,um,i want to apologize,too.

780
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:44,950
I got turned around,and,um,i
was out of line.

781
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,620
And congratulations on solving the case.

782
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,850
Come here. Give me a hug.

783
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:51,370
- Come on. There we go.
- Okay.

784
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:53,170
- You're a good man.
- All right.

785
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,850
Okay. Okay.

786
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:00,280
That's not how we do things
in the marshals office,

787
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:03,230
But,uh,i guess it works.

788
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,710
You two,be well.

789
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:10,280
What were you thinking,by
t way? Unbelievable.

790
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:12,970
Believe,lisbon. Believe.

791
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:16,150
You gotta look at it this way--
We've closed yet another case.

792
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,780
Toying with mafia bosses is no
way to close cases. It's stupid.

793
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:22,180
You're just trying to
find fault,and i know why.

794
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:23,130
Oh,really?

795
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:26,210
Yeah. You're still a little grumpy about
the birthday present thing,aren't you?

796
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:27,640
Will you leave that alone?

797
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:31,480
Oh,unbelievable. You know,you got
no reason to be grumpy anymore.
