1
00:00:10,661 --> 00:00:12,577
We do this, too, you know.

2
00:00:13,171 --> 00:00:15,699
What's that? Silence as a weapon.

3
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,212
Make people uneasy. Make 'em talk.

4
00:00:19,288 --> 00:00:22,163
I get paid whether you
talk or not, teresa.

5
00:00:22,811 --> 00:00:25,289
Cbi's been paying you for
five weeks now, doctor.

6
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,885
This was supposed to be routine.

7
00:00:26,886 --> 00:00:30,360
Routine, like you have to
see me after a shooting? Sure.

8
00:00:30,361 --> 00:00:33,137
Not routine like I
have to sign off on you.

9
00:00:33,138 --> 00:00:35,873
I didn't even pull the
trigger on tanner. Jane did.

10
00:00:35,874 --> 00:00:38,409
You signed off on him after one session.

11
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,785
He has good mental health.

12
00:00:40,844 --> 00:00:44,027
Nowi want to see your
license to practice. Ha ha.

13
00:00:44,028 --> 00:00:45,742
Ah, "ha ha."

14
00:00:45,743 --> 00:00:48,192
I've got six open cases.
I'm testifying in two more.

15
00:00:48,193 --> 00:00:51,505
I don't have time... and it's not as
if you have anything to talk about.

16
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:55,476
Mom dead when you were
12, 3 younger brothers,

17
00:00:55,477 --> 00:00:58,504
abusive, alcoholic dad, now dead also.

18
00:00:58,505 --> 00:01:00,472
It doesn't say "abusive."

19
00:01:05,306 --> 00:01:07,428
But he was, yes?

20
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:11,640
This coffee tastes like crap, seriously.

21
00:01:15,635 --> 00:01:16,707
Are we done?

22
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:18,644
no. Let's talk about

23
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:21,940
what you want to talk about.
What do you do for fun?

24
00:01:21,941 --> 00:01:22,776
fun?

25
00:01:22,777 --> 00:01:26,013
That thing when you're not working...

26
00:01:26,054 --> 00:01:29,540
I, uh... What does this have to do...

27
00:01:33,656 --> 00:01:35,142
Lisbon.

28
00:01:35,481 --> 00:01:37,294
Yeah, I'll be right there.

29
00:01:37,852 --> 00:01:39,984
Duty calls. I get it.

30
00:01:43,688 --> 00:01:45,269
Dr. Carmen?

31
00:01:46,216 --> 00:01:48,382
Why won't you sign off on me?

32
00:01:48,383 --> 00:01:51,289
Because there's something
you want to tell me first.

33
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:54,203
I'll see you next week.

34
00:01:58,554 --> 00:02:00,911
How'd we catch this one?
Switchboard got an anonymous call

35
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:03,906
saying there's a dead body. It's
two blocks from us. Here we are.

36
00:02:03,907 --> 00:02:06,341
There's just one problem. No body?

37
00:02:06,342 --> 00:02:09,707
No body. Oh, not the dumpsters.
Please, not the dumpsters.

38
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:12,582
Look around for the
body, see what you see.

39
00:02:17,842 --> 00:02:19,130
Shrink day, huh?

40
00:02:19,131 --> 00:02:21,004
no. Yes. Yes.

41
00:02:21,005 --> 00:02:24,059
You have the line between
your eyebrows. He annoys you.

42
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,544
And besides, you smell a
little of his cigar smoke.

43
00:02:27,545 --> 00:02:30,738
I'm annoyed because I forgot
my cell phone. Oh, right.

44
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:33,274
Cho, anything? Nothin'.

45
00:02:36,467 --> 00:02:38,288
Did you know that if you weighed

46
00:02:38,289 --> 00:02:40,817
every living thing on planet earth,

47
00:02:40,818 --> 00:02:43,904
a quarter of that biomass
would be just ants?

48
00:02:43,905 --> 00:02:45,665
That's a lot of ants. It is.

49
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:46,886
Cho, anything?

50
00:02:46,887 --> 00:02:48,709
No sign of a body.

51
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,207
All right, then look in the dumpsters.

52
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:52,126
Let's get outta here.

53
00:02:52,235 --> 00:02:54,033
I did it last time.

54
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,715
Oh, man, I just got this suit.

55
00:02:55,716 --> 00:02:57,715
All right, rock paper scissors,

56
00:02:57,716 --> 00:02:58,386
on three, ready? One, two, three.

57
00:02:58,387 --> 00:02:59,718
yes!

58
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:04,792
Been dry this fall, huh? No rain.

59
00:03:05,253 --> 00:03:06,327
Like tinder.

60
00:03:06,328 --> 00:03:08,704
Mm. That's why those ants
are looking for moisture

61
00:03:08,705 --> 00:03:10,555
wherever they can find it.

62
00:03:10,556 --> 00:03:13,239
Then why aren't all the ants
in the wet, stinky dumpsters?

63
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,733
Exactly. Because they've
found somewhere else

64
00:03:15,734 --> 00:03:18,160
where there's a little more m...

65
00:03:18,513 --> 00:03:22,490
Oh. Rigsby? A little help here.

66
00:03:22,491 --> 00:03:24,206
Oh, please.

67
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:37,199
Looks like three to
the chest, point-blank.

68
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,182
Perfect triangle formation.

69
00:03:40,496 --> 00:03:41,991
No brass... Looks like the shooter took

70
00:03:41,992 --> 00:03:45,548
the shell casings with him.
Pro job. I can't find any i.d.

71
00:03:46,161 --> 00:03:48,215
Call forensics. Run him for prints.

72
00:03:48,216 --> 00:03:51,098
Who is he? Name's william
mcteer, from san francisco,

73
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:54,285
serial child rapist, served
six years at pelican bay.

74
00:03:54,286 --> 00:03:57,058
And you know this how? I'm
the one who sent him there.

75
00:03:57,059 --> 00:03:58,542
ah.

76
00:03:58,744 --> 00:04:00,227
We're near marie's donuts.

77
00:04:00,228 --> 00:04:02,910
Anyone want to go for a bear claw after?

78
00:04:05,814 --> 00:04:07,560
Can't say I'm hungry.

79
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:22,840
Jane, we have a case. You
think I have time for games?

80
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:26,847
Life is a game. You have
plenty of time for that. Shh.

81
00:04:26,848 --> 00:04:30,639
Shh! I'm gonna read your thoughts.

82
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:33,385
I want you to take a deep breath in...

83
00:04:35,227 --> 00:04:36,972
And out.

84
00:04:38,524 --> 00:04:40,219
Will you concentrate?

85
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:46,415
Name as many 20th century
presidents as you can... Now.

86
00:04:46,415 --> 00:04:50,424
Uh, coolidge, wilson, roosevelt...

87
00:04:50,687 --> 00:04:54,785
Um, eisenhower, truman,
kennedy, nixon, l.b.j. Good.

88
00:04:54,786 --> 00:04:56,739
Take another breath in...

89
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,489
And out.

90
00:05:03,821 --> 00:05:07,218
Concentrate on which mug it is under.

91
00:05:07,219 --> 00:05:09,857
I am listening to your thoughts.

92
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:13,809
Don't shout. I can hear you.

93
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,427
Open your eyes.

94
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:22,226
Well, you did have a 25% shot.

95
00:05:22,227 --> 00:05:26,503
We could do it all day, and
I would get it every time.

96
00:05:26,504 --> 00:05:28,722
Give me that. How'd you do it?

97
00:05:28,723 --> 00:05:31,045
You told me, lisbon.

98
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,133
Our minds are in sync.

99
00:05:34,193 --> 00:05:36,313
In fact, right now... right
now i'm feeling something...

100
00:05:36,314 --> 00:05:39,782
I'm getting it right here.
It's a... It's a nickname.

101
00:05:40,203 --> 00:05:43,242
"saint... Teresa."

102
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,468
How come you never told me
how you know agent bosco?

103
00:05:49,844 --> 00:05:53,474
Look, another one. Lisbon was
like a rock star for awhile.

104
00:05:53,475 --> 00:05:54,848
What's with her hair?

105
00:05:54,849 --> 00:05:57,469
What's wrong with my hair? Nothing.

106
00:05:58,093 --> 00:06:00,961
The mcteer case made your
career and you never said a word.

107
00:06:00,962 --> 00:06:04,388
You're like a superhero
with a secret identity.

108
00:06:04,456 --> 00:06:06,410
uh, You wanna know the deal?

109
00:06:06,411 --> 00:06:10,821
Fine. Mcteer hit the
bay area for 18 months.

110
00:06:10,822 --> 00:06:14,439
He attacked 7 girls
between the ages of 6 and 9.

111
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,020
I was the s.f.p.d.
Inspector who caught it.

112
00:06:17,021 --> 00:06:20,961
I inspected... took mcteer
down. Now, what do you got?

113
00:06:20,962 --> 00:06:23,349
B.f.s. Found the shooter's gun
a block away in a trash bin.

114
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,943
They're running it for prints now.

115
00:06:24,944 --> 00:06:27,609
"'inspector lisbon's
actions were lauded as heroic

116
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:30,758
"'by city officials and
her s.f.p.d. Colleagues,'

117
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:33,369
said her supervisor,
lieutenant samuel bosco"?

118
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,406
"inspector lisbon did an exemplary job

119
00:06:35,407 --> 00:06:38,267
tracking down and
arresting this animal."

120
00:06:38,268 --> 00:06:40,914
Well, that's pretty good. You
should get an act together.

121
00:06:40,915 --> 00:06:43,948
Can you do barbra
streisand? Don't tempt me.

122
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,889
So I heard about mcteer.

123
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:48,528
Weird, huh? I mean, here we
are again, after how many years?

124
00:06:48,529 --> 00:06:52,043
Too many. Have you spoken to dreyer?

125
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:53,239
He'd be my favorite.

126
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,233
Dreyer whelan... Father
of the last victim,

127
00:06:55,234 --> 00:06:59,916
katy...7 years old, promised
to kill mcteer on release.

128
00:06:59,917 --> 00:07:02,071
I called him. He's on his way
down from marin. All right.

129
00:07:02,072 --> 00:07:05,062
You're all over it. Let me
know if you need any help...

130
00:07:05,063 --> 00:07:08,496
For old times' sake.
For old times' sake.

131
00:07:09,249 --> 00:07:11,466
Here's mcteer's address.
Parole officer says he's got

132
00:07:11,467 --> 00:07:14,967
a live-in girlfriend. Go and
talk to her. He has a girlfriend?

133
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:17,277
I think I'll go with her.
Good idea. Rigsby, check up

134
00:07:17,278 --> 00:07:19,104
on mcteer's old friends
from the pedophile world,

135
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,648
especially those who might have moved

136
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:23,944
from san francisco to
sacramento. Sure, boss.

137
00:07:24,017 --> 00:07:26,340
Cho and I have a trial
meeting with the deputy a.g.

138
00:07:26,341 --> 00:07:30,248
Not if I throw myself into
oncoming traffic first.

139
00:07:32,597 --> 00:07:34,334
Ms. Derask, what was your relationship

140
00:07:34,335 --> 00:07:37,484
with william mcteer? He was my fianc?.

141
00:07:37,485 --> 00:07:38,733
Fianc?.

142
00:07:38,734 --> 00:07:40,242
You have a problem with that?

143
00:07:40,243 --> 00:07:42,895
Oh, she just can't see how a
woman could fall in love with

144
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:47,681
a convicted pedophile... not,
uh, the best husband material.

145
00:07:47,682 --> 00:07:51,410
Bill was a good man, a good provider.

146
00:07:51,411 --> 00:07:54,117
And he treated me like a queen.

147
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,325
And those charges in san francisco

148
00:07:56,326 --> 00:07:57,790
were totally bogus anyway.

149
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,714
That bitch cop had it in for him...

150
00:07:59,715 --> 00:08:02,677
A "vendetta," is what bill called it.

151
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:04,265
You gotta learn how to
clean that trap, tanya...

152
00:08:04,266 --> 00:08:06,267
That's where the clog w...

153
00:08:07,809 --> 00:08:09,445
hey. hey.

154
00:08:09,446 --> 00:08:11,362
It's the police... About bill.

155
00:08:11,363 --> 00:08:14,015
My brother came over
to fix the sink for me.

156
00:08:14,016 --> 00:08:16,528
David. Patrick.

157
00:08:17,107 --> 00:08:18,869
hey. That's grace.

158
00:08:19,059 --> 00:08:21,240
David, do you know william mcteer?

159
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,971
I met him a couple of times.

160
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,047
He treated tanya good, so, you know...

161
00:08:27,484 --> 00:08:30,586
Anyway, I just gotta reattach
it and you're all set, t.

162
00:08:30,926 --> 00:08:32,300
Nice meeting you guys.

163
00:08:32,301 --> 00:08:33,861
You, too.

164
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:38,467
Do you know anyone who
would want to harm william?

165
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:41,939
Well... It's probably nothin',

166
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,743
but he had a fight with
his boss last week...

167
00:08:46,744 --> 00:08:50,380
Came home all moody, said
the guy was out to get him.

168
00:08:50,381 --> 00:08:54,656
Who's his boss? Some
pip-squeak. I don't know.

169
00:08:55,418 --> 00:09:00,492
Uh, xxxyz incorporated is the
name of the place, I think.

170
00:09:01,191 --> 00:09:03,876
It's, uh, over on
winley, near the highway.

171
00:09:04,564 --> 00:09:05,324
Hey, mommy.

172
00:09:05,325 --> 00:09:08,272
Hey, emily, baby. How was school?

173
00:09:08,273 --> 00:09:09,915
I can multiply my sixes.

174
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:13,282
Wanna hear? Wow. Maybe
a little later, okay?

175
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:18,463
Bill wasn't who you think.

176
00:09:18,631 --> 00:09:21,816
Hi, emily. I'm patrick.

177
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,516
How are you? Good.

178
00:09:23,517 --> 00:09:25,478
Good day, huh? Mm-hmm.

179
00:09:25,479 --> 00:09:27,413
Six times tables, huh?

180
00:09:27,414 --> 00:09:30,425
Wow. Why don't you go into the kitchen

181
00:09:30,426 --> 00:09:32,579
and help your uncle david?

182
00:09:33,658 --> 00:09:35,106
It's okay, sweetie.

183
00:09:36,157 --> 00:09:37,556
See ya.

184
00:09:41,783 --> 00:09:44,254
I don't think mcteer touched emily.

185
00:09:44,797 --> 00:09:47,076
See? I told you.

186
00:09:47,077 --> 00:09:48,755
Because he was still grooming her.

187
00:09:48,756 --> 00:09:50,539
You don't know what
you're talking about.

188
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,142
You met bill at a
shopping mall, didn't you?

189
00:09:53,202 --> 00:09:56,133
Near the video arcade
or... or the movie theater.

190
00:09:56,134 --> 00:09:57,833
Emily was with you.

191
00:09:57,834 --> 00:09:59,753
He worked there back then.

192
00:09:59,754 --> 00:10:03,466
Yeah. Real gentleman...
Not like your other guys.

193
00:10:03,467 --> 00:10:06,483
He... he never pressured
you to have sex.

194
00:10:07,511 --> 00:10:09,274
Wasn't love at first
sight, but he was just

195
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,390
so good with emily. He listened to her.

196
00:10:11,391 --> 00:10:14,251
Nobody listened to you
like that, growing up.

197
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,603
Bill wanted to be a father.

198
00:10:17,132 --> 00:10:19,305
My girl doesn't deserve a father?

199
00:10:19,306 --> 00:10:21,458
Lately, he'd been asking
if he could take emily away

200
00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:23,814
on an overnight trip... Maybe camping,

201
00:10:23,815 --> 00:10:26,446
a little father/daughter bonding.

202
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:30,019
He'd been pressuring you
to say yes, just a little...

203
00:10:31,342 --> 00:10:35,401
But just enough to start to nag you...

204
00:10:36,368 --> 00:10:39,485
A tiny, little scratching nag...

205
00:10:40,612 --> 00:10:43,557
That maybe what you
felt deep down was right.

206
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,803
William mcteer...

207
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:49,037
Was too good to be true.

208
00:10:57,221 --> 00:10:59,733
You deserve a good man, tanya.

209
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,087
If you can't believe that for yourself,

210
00:11:02,088 --> 00:11:06,117
then just pretend... For emily's sake.

211
00:11:11,651 --> 00:11:14,337
We done here? Could... can...
I gotta eat. I'm starving.

212
00:11:14,338 --> 00:11:15,772
Yeah.

213
00:11:16,835 --> 00:11:18,020
All right.

214
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,576
You each are the state's key witnesses

215
00:11:29,577 --> 00:11:30,936
in a few cases this month.

216
00:11:30,937 --> 00:11:32,586
Agent lisbon, you've got howard and eng.

217
00:11:32,587 --> 00:11:35,130
Agent cho, you've got
ringman, daly and freed.

218
00:11:35,131 --> 00:11:37,234
Freed. Freed bit me.

219
00:11:37,235 --> 00:11:39,155
And be sure to mention
that on the stand.

220
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:40,837
Teresa, you remember howard?

221
00:11:40,838 --> 00:11:42,743
He and his syndicate stole $100 million

222
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:45,145
from the online accounts
of thousands of people.

223
00:11:45,146 --> 00:11:47,285
And then he stashed the
money and killed his partner?

224
00:11:47,286 --> 00:11:50,043
I remember him. The guy's
creepy. Guy's going to prison,

225
00:11:50,044 --> 00:11:53,614
thanks to agent lisbon and
her cool, calm expertise.

226
00:11:53,615 --> 00:11:55,784
That's me... Cool and calm.

227
00:11:55,785 --> 00:11:57,969
So glad this isn't a jane case.

228
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,985
You havegotto tell him,
teresa, that he cannot

229
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:01,791
threaten people with
bombs to get a confession.

230
00:12:01,792 --> 00:12:04,956
No rubber masks, no monster
suits... hey, we have a problem.

231
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:06,984
B.f.s. Got a print off
the gun that killed mcteer.

232
00:12:06,985 --> 00:12:09,315
And that's a problem? Yeah.

233
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:12,541
Boss, the print is yours.

234
00:12:20,332 --> 00:12:21,748
Your fingerprint is on the magazine

235
00:12:21,749 --> 00:12:25,584
of the murder weapon.
Tell me why I shouldn't be

236
00:12:25,585 --> 00:12:27,880
throwing up in the bathroom right now.

237
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,765
It's a lab error. It must be.

238
00:12:29,766 --> 00:12:31,559
They're overworked and underfunded.

239
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,258
This happened last
year with the l.a.p.d.

240
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:36,160
Just have them retest it.

241
00:12:36,161 --> 00:12:38,564
Come on! You don't think I did this.

242
00:12:38,565 --> 00:12:42,340
What I think is, I'm up to my
asterisk in political quicksand.

243
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:45,084
You and your team are off
the mcteer case, obviously.

244
00:12:45,085 --> 00:12:47,459
I understand. Are we
throwing it to the fbi?

245
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,103
no.

246
00:12:51,267 --> 00:12:53,726
Hey, lisbon. How about this, huh?

247
00:12:53,727 --> 00:12:56,706
Bosco. He knows as much about
the mcteer case as you do.

248
00:12:56,707 --> 00:12:57,905
It makes sense.

249
00:12:57,906 --> 00:13:00,901
And, yes, I had to pull some strings.

250
00:13:00,902 --> 00:13:03,570
Thank you. I... Guess.

251
00:13:03,571 --> 00:13:06,222
No, no, don't... Don't misunderstand me.

252
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,893
If you're guilty, I want you nailed.

253
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:12,101
I just don't want the feebs
strolling around my offices,

254
00:13:12,102 --> 00:13:14,691
asking impertinent questions. Okay.

255
00:13:14,692 --> 00:13:17,124
So you understand, I have to
ask you some questions now?

256
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:20,216
Nothing personal. Absolutely. Shoot.

257
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:22,210
Hey, everybody.

258
00:13:22,211 --> 00:13:25,800
Uh, well, I bet you wish
you wore some gloves, huh?

259
00:13:25,801 --> 00:13:28,315
So you have some input
here? No. Just nosy.

260
00:13:28,316 --> 00:13:31,323
It's okay. He can stay
if he wants to. I'll stay.

261
00:13:33,694 --> 00:13:35,844
Where were you tuesday night?

262
00:13:35,845 --> 00:13:38,829
I was at home, watching television.

263
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:39,978
Nobody saw me.

264
00:13:39,979 --> 00:13:43,075
What'd you watch? Some reality show.

265
00:13:43,076 --> 00:13:44,649
Which?

266
00:13:44,988 --> 00:13:47,298
Cooking show, with a man.

267
00:13:48,706 --> 00:13:49,870
Oh, yeah. That one.

268
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:52,256
The angry man. Yeah. Oh, I
know the one. That's good.

269
00:13:52,257 --> 00:13:53,910
Cooking show. Tuesday nights.

270
00:13:53,911 --> 00:13:55,804
Yeah. Angry man.

271
00:13:57,685 --> 00:14:01,422
So I can, uh, set up a time
for you to take a polygraph.

272
00:14:05,923 --> 00:14:07,348
no.

273
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:10,668
I didn't kill mcteer.

274
00:14:10,669 --> 00:14:12,394
Nobody said you did yet.

275
00:14:12,395 --> 00:14:13,783
yet?

276
00:14:21,954 --> 00:14:23,754
Good luck with the case.

277
00:14:29,421 --> 00:14:30,856
Having lunch?

278
00:14:30,857 --> 00:14:32,728
A discussion... About
lisbon's situation.

279
00:14:32,729 --> 00:14:34,850
Okay, cho, you say work
the mcteer case hard,

280
00:14:34,851 --> 00:14:36,658
screw bosco and minelli, you disagree,

281
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:40,422
and you're not so sure. I'm
just saying, maybe we should

282
00:14:40,423 --> 00:14:43,545
let bosco do his job, stay out
of his way. He's a good cop.

283
00:14:43,546 --> 00:14:45,553
Is anybody gonna go as
hard after this case as us?

284
00:14:45,554 --> 00:14:46,726
I don't think so.

285
00:14:46,727 --> 00:14:48,238
Well, you're assuming
lisbon didn't kill him.

286
00:14:48,239 --> 00:14:50,815
What if she did kill
him? What would you do?

287
00:14:52,977 --> 00:14:54,466
What wouldyoudo?

288
00:14:54,571 --> 00:14:57,863
Me? I'd walk away. But I ain't the law.

289
00:14:58,377 --> 00:15:00,074
Yes, we walk away.

290
00:15:00,075 --> 00:15:02,057
Yeah. I disagree.

291
00:15:02,058 --> 00:15:03,734
Mcteer went after little children.

292
00:15:03,735 --> 00:15:05,831
Hey, maybe he deserved to
die. If lisbon has the guts

293
00:15:05,832 --> 00:15:08,548
to kill him, she has the
guts to serve her time for it.

294
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:13,369
I'm gonna talk to mcteer's
boss. I'll come with you.

295
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,803
Okay, okay. Look, lisbon
didn't do it anyhow.

296
00:15:16,804 --> 00:15:19,467
I mean, right? She's
not capable of that.

297
00:15:19,468 --> 00:15:21,199
I'm not so sure.

298
00:15:36,409 --> 00:15:39,077
What's up that we couldn't
talk inside? I'm busy.

299
00:15:39,078 --> 00:15:40,868
Thought you might want
to be outside so you could

300
00:15:40,869 --> 00:15:44,194
express your anger
without constraint. Why?

301
00:15:45,676 --> 00:15:47,850
I know you lied about the alibi.

302
00:15:47,851 --> 00:15:49,502
I didn't lie.

303
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,976
I don't know what you
did on tuesday night,

304
00:15:51,977 --> 00:15:56,258
but you weren't watching tv.
I didn't lie. He made risotto.

305
00:15:56,259 --> 00:15:59,466
Now this is insulting. You
gonna continue lying to me?

306
00:16:05,517 --> 00:16:07,080
I can't remember.

307
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:10,171
I can't remember what I did
on tuesday night. It's weird.

308
00:16:10,172 --> 00:16:12,356
Thank you. And it's
okay. The memory's there.

309
00:16:12,357 --> 00:16:14,969
We can get it back. If I
put you in a light trance...

310
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:18,739
Like that's gonna happen.
Stop trying to hypnotize me.

311
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,187
What if something traumatic happened

312
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:22,128
and you're blocking it out?

313
00:16:22,526 --> 00:16:24,166
I didn't kill mcteer.

314
00:16:24,167 --> 00:16:27,455
Well, let me hypnotize
you so we can be sure. No.

315
00:16:27,456 --> 00:16:30,546
Why not? 'cause I don't
want you inside my head.

316
00:16:37,941 --> 00:16:40,485
So it turns out you're not
quite done with the mcteer case.

317
00:16:40,486 --> 00:16:42,763
Funny. It's not my choice.

318
00:16:42,764 --> 00:16:44,198
He'll only talk to you.

319
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:45,668
Who?

320
00:16:46,694 --> 00:16:48,860
Agent lisbon. Hello, dreyer.

321
00:16:49,157 --> 00:16:51,294
Thanks for coming in and
helping us out, Mr. Whelan.

322
00:16:53,072 --> 00:16:57,176
So, you guys are still working together?

323
00:16:57,177 --> 00:16:58,728
Still a team?

324
00:16:58,812 --> 00:17:00,386
We're both handling this interview

325
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:02,855
at your request, dreyer. We just have

326
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:04,366
a couple questions for you.

327
00:17:04,367 --> 00:17:07,651
Just one, in fact. Did
you kill william mcteer?

328
00:17:11,374 --> 00:17:12,854
I didn't.

329
00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:16,441
Glad to hear it. How's katy doing?

330
00:17:16,894 --> 00:17:18,344
She's well.

331
00:17:19,061 --> 00:17:20,453
Doing well.

332
00:17:20,454 --> 00:17:23,337
Healing better than I am,
according to our therapist.

333
00:17:23,928 --> 00:17:26,039
Where were you tuesday night?

334
00:17:26,176 --> 00:17:27,955
At home, alone.

335
00:17:28,187 --> 00:17:31,462
Katy spent the night at a
friend's. And what time...

336
00:17:31,463 --> 00:17:34,004
You let him hurt her. Excuse me?

337
00:17:34,005 --> 00:17:35,814
I recently read the incident files.

338
00:17:35,815 --> 00:17:38,549
The internal s.f.p.d. Files?
How'd you get ahold of those?

339
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:40,619
You could've taken mcteer
down the friday before...

340
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:44,010
A whole week earlier. That was
not the case. I didn't have it.

341
00:17:44,011 --> 00:17:46,474
I didn't have anything to nail him on.
And in the meantime, he attacked katy.

342
00:17:46,475 --> 00:17:50,077
And you could've saved her.
If I'd arrested him on a hunch,

343
00:17:50,078 --> 00:17:53,884
he would have been acquitted. He would have
walked. But katy wouldn't have been raped.

344
00:17:56,908 --> 00:17:59,436
And that is your fault.

345
00:18:03,552 --> 00:18:05,709
Mr. Whelan. What?

346
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,120
You swore you'd spend your
entire fortune in the service

347
00:18:08,121 --> 00:18:12,866
of killing william mcteer.
Why didn't you? I couldn't.

348
00:18:14,363 --> 00:18:16,032
What if I'd been caught?

349
00:18:17,047 --> 00:18:18,769
I couldn't leave katy alone.

350
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:21,698
My take? Maybe you just
didn't have the guts.

351
00:18:22,683 --> 00:18:25,922
Go to hell. Both of you.

352
00:18:29,806 --> 00:18:32,350
Don't worry about him. He's angry.

353
00:18:32,834 --> 00:18:34,925
Anger turns you.

354
00:18:35,251 --> 00:18:36,797
Yes, it does.

355
00:18:40,232 --> 00:18:42,210
I want to take the polygraph.

356
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,844
How long did mcteer work for you?

357
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,623
Uh, couple months. His
record didn't bother you?

358
00:19:24,624 --> 00:19:26,787
Nah, freaks work harder, you know?

359
00:19:26,788 --> 00:19:29,255
They're grateful for the gig, you know?

360
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:31,060
Not mcteer, though.

361
00:19:31,061 --> 00:19:32,558
Is that why you two got in a fight?

362
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,759
Me and him? No. We
didn't get in a fight.

363
00:19:36,772 --> 00:19:39,006
He got in a fight with
his jackhole buddy, dog.

364
00:19:39,007 --> 00:19:40,795
They got in a fight right here
in the middle of the place...

365
00:19:40,796 --> 00:19:44,180
Busted it all up, so I
fired his twisted ass.

366
00:19:44,181 --> 00:19:47,037
I mean, that's management
101, you know... no fistfights,

367
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:49,219
so I booted him. He come
back at you about that?

368
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:53,402
No. He knows better than
that. He knows I'm connected.

369
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,664
Connected, really? To whom?

370
00:19:56,068 --> 00:19:59,081
Uh... People?

371
00:20:01,437 --> 00:20:04,792
So what was it about? Mcteer's
fight with dog? I don't know.

372
00:20:04,793 --> 00:20:07,489
Could've been about a
million things, you know?

373
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:11,389
Dog was a utility idiot. He's
dumb in ten different ways.

374
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:12,683
"dog" have a real name?

375
00:20:12,684 --> 00:20:17,321
Everybody does. I
don't know what his was.

376
00:20:17,522 --> 00:20:21,298
Oh, those are on special...
Buy one, get one free.

377
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:23,032
No, thanks.

378
00:20:26,694 --> 00:20:28,524
People vs. Milton r. Howard,

379
00:20:28,525 --> 00:20:32,579
case number 97t03254, come on down.

380
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,467
Agent lisbon, we have to talk.

381
00:20:34,468 --> 00:20:36,367
How about you give me
a confession, howard?

382
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:39,251
Agent, I-I didn't do these
things they said I did.

383
00:20:39,252 --> 00:20:42,485
Okay? Y-you have to hear my
side of it. I'll see you inside.

384
00:20:43,564 --> 00:20:45,897
Agent lisbon. Virgil, talk
to her after. We're up.

385
00:20:45,898 --> 00:20:48,877
Agent lisbon will not be joing you.
Is my team okay? Is somebody hurt?

386
00:20:48,878 --> 00:20:52,317
No. You failed the poly, agent lisbon.

387
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:55,494
"significant indications
of deception," they say.

388
00:20:56,013 --> 00:20:59,661
You're relieved of duty, agent.
Report to admin for processing.

389
00:20:59,662 --> 00:21:02,078
Boss. Don't.

390
00:21:14,058 --> 00:21:16,917
Signature on the bottom,
gun and badge in the tray.

391
00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:38,315
Here's your receipt.

392
00:21:39,889 --> 00:21:41,515
Have a nice day.

393
00:21:55,057 --> 00:22:00,402
Teresa lisbon in my office,
talking. You must be desperate.

394
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:03,450
I failed the polygraph. I
don't know what I'm gonna do.

395
00:22:03,764 --> 00:22:07,687
Well, reading polys is
more art than a science.

396
00:22:07,688 --> 00:22:10,827
Ask to retake it. I can
teach you how to relax.

397
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:20,487
My father used to have
blackouts when he drank.

398
00:22:20,735 --> 00:22:22,835
One time, he beat my
brother half to death,

399
00:22:22,836 --> 00:22:25,848
and he didn't remember a thing.

400
00:22:26,851 --> 00:22:28,640
The whole way to the
hospital, he couldn't believe

401
00:22:28,641 --> 00:22:30,575
it was him who did it.

402
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:32,633
Are you drinking?

403
00:22:32,634 --> 00:22:35,720
Is that why you're talking of blackouts?

404
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:37,687
What I need to know
is, is... is it possible

405
00:22:37,688 --> 00:22:39,683
that I killed mcteer and blotted it out?

406
00:22:39,684 --> 00:22:42,202
You can't remember the
night of the murder?

407
00:22:43,617 --> 00:22:46,460
Well, don't panic. There
could be lots of reasons...

408
00:22:46,461 --> 00:22:49,184
Stress or... cops can
become killers, doctor.

409
00:22:49,185 --> 00:22:50,721
It can happen. It's ridiculous.

410
00:22:50,722 --> 00:22:53,930
You didn't even know
mcteer was in sacramento.

411
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,985
His parole officer
called me last month...

412
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:58,862
Courtesy heads-up.

413
00:22:58,863 --> 00:23:00,232
Well...

414
00:23:02,228 --> 00:23:06,515
Can memory loss be a
result of trauma? Sure.

415
00:23:06,516 --> 00:23:09,550
Your mind shields you from
the awful thing you did,

416
00:23:09,551 --> 00:23:11,494
or even what someone else did.

417
00:23:11,495 --> 00:23:14,504
Child molesters don't get better.

418
00:23:14,505 --> 00:23:17,892
The killer saved a child's
life, whoever it is.

419
00:23:17,893 --> 00:23:19,869
How do I unblock my memory?

420
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:23,010
Maybe it will come back
on its own. Give it time.

421
00:23:23,011 --> 00:23:25,095
I don't have time.
You... you're useless...

422
00:23:25,096 --> 00:23:27,218
You and all your talking. I'm sorry.

423
00:23:27,219 --> 00:23:30,823
Until you remember, I
don't know how to help you.

424
00:23:40,638 --> 00:23:42,042
Jane.

425
00:23:44,674 --> 00:23:46,441
Oh, hey, lisbon.

426
00:23:46,732 --> 00:23:49,659
I imagine you want me
to hypnotize you now.

427
00:23:50,727 --> 00:23:52,179
Yeah.

428
00:23:53,674 --> 00:23:56,438
Nothing in mcteer's parole
files about any "dog."

429
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,527
No known associates, either.

430
00:24:00,181 --> 00:24:01,558
Black widow.

431
00:24:02,255 --> 00:24:04,986
Dead one. What the hell
do you think you're doing?

432
00:24:05,392 --> 00:24:07,154
Killing a spider. What areyoudoing?

433
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:11,161
You're interfering with my case.
You're talking to witnesses.

434
00:24:11,162 --> 00:24:12,538
You're wrong.

435
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:14,998
You gonna lie to me
now? What's the problem?

436
00:24:14,999 --> 00:24:17,467
Drop the mcteer case, or
you'll be on guard duty

437
00:24:17,468 --> 00:24:20,324
at the state capital, saluting tourists.

438
00:24:23,692 --> 00:24:25,224
Is that right?

439
00:24:27,531 --> 00:24:29,244
Yes, it is.

440
00:24:32,511 --> 00:24:34,799
Nice comeback. You told him.

441
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,514
He knows the score.

442
00:24:38,588 --> 00:24:40,024
May i?

443
00:24:40,499 --> 00:24:43,692
Thanks. My guy at
pelican bay came through.

444
00:24:44,453 --> 00:24:47,936
Mcteer had a cellmate for two years...

445
00:24:48,228 --> 00:24:49,836
Nicknamed "dog."

446
00:24:49,837 --> 00:24:51,743
Hey, we know this guy.

447
00:24:51,913 --> 00:24:55,958
That's the brother of mcteer's
girlfriend... david charles.

448
00:25:02,633 --> 00:25:04,160
It's kind of a mess.

449
00:25:04,161 --> 00:25:05,530
Not at all.

450
00:25:05,733 --> 00:25:07,123
It's nice.

451
00:25:08,321 --> 00:25:09,743
I like those pictures.

452
00:25:09,744 --> 00:25:12,160
Those are mostly from the last tenants.

453
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:17,138
Uh, where... Where are we gonna do this?

454
00:25:17,277 --> 00:25:20,367
Ah, interesting.

455
00:25:20,368 --> 00:25:22,975
Let's just do it. Let... let's go.

456
00:25:23,442 --> 00:25:24,671
no.

457
00:25:24,672 --> 00:25:25,519
no?

458
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,902
No, I'm not gonna
hypnotize you here, lisbon.

459
00:25:27,903 --> 00:25:29,506
You're... you're too
stressed. Are you kidding me?

460
00:25:29,507 --> 00:25:31,456
No, it's okay, shh.
It's okay, all right?

461
00:25:31,457 --> 00:25:34,100
I'd have to make all the
stress leave your body,

462
00:25:34,234 --> 00:25:38,023
maybe have you count
down from 100, 99, 98...

463
00:25:38,024 --> 00:25:39,788
We'd go round and round...

464
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:44,690
94, 93... Listen to me, lisbon.

465
00:25:44,986 --> 00:25:47,431
All the stress would have to melt away.

466
00:25:47,432 --> 00:25:51,634
You'd have to feel calm
and relaxed and very safe.

467
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:54,907
It's just about impossible.
I'm not hypnotizing you, lisbon.

468
00:25:54,908 --> 00:25:57,430
It's not gonna happen,
so you can just relax.

469
00:25:57,431 --> 00:26:02,962
You are not falling into a
deep, relaxing trance state.

470
00:26:06,995 --> 00:26:08,619
Sleep.

471
00:26:08,991 --> 00:26:10,865
Okay. Good.

472
00:26:11,206 --> 00:26:12,948
All right.

473
00:26:17,197 --> 00:26:19,793
So you're going down the steps...

474
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:22,861
Relaxing with each step...

475
00:26:24,143 --> 00:26:26,483
And now you reach the bottom...

476
00:26:27,682 --> 00:26:29,603
The very last step.

477
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,425
The ultimate place of calm.

478
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,732
How are you feeling?

479
00:26:35,874 --> 00:26:37,260
Good.

480
00:26:37,573 --> 00:26:38,947
Good.

481
00:26:39,371 --> 00:26:42,313
You're gonna remain in
this relaxed trance state

482
00:26:42,314 --> 00:26:44,686
while we think about tuesday night.

483
00:26:44,699 --> 00:26:46,090
But first...

484
00:26:46,713 --> 00:26:49,870
Sometimes you dance to that
spice girls cd, don't you?

485
00:26:49,871 --> 00:26:51,238
Yeah.

486
00:26:53,234 --> 00:26:54,658
I thought so.

487
00:26:57,028 --> 00:26:58,591
Now, tuesday.

488
00:27:00,879 --> 00:27:03,895
You can watch the whole
day like it's a movie.

489
00:27:04,592 --> 00:27:07,100
Every detail is in focus.

490
00:27:07,101 --> 00:27:09,480
You can zoom into any moment you want.

491
00:27:09,481 --> 00:27:12,077
You can fast-forward, rewind.

492
00:27:12,078 --> 00:27:15,747
Youare in total control, okay?

493
00:27:15,748 --> 00:27:17,154
Okay.

494
00:27:17,745 --> 00:27:19,134
Good.

495
00:27:21,376 --> 00:27:22,846
What do you see?

496
00:27:24,433 --> 00:27:28,522
I'm finishing up the form
41s on the milbank case.

497
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,727
I feel...

498
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:34,283
Hungry, 'cause I skipped lunch.

499
00:27:35,634 --> 00:27:38,272
The new guy in the mailroom is hot.

500
00:27:38,273 --> 00:27:38,960
Is he?

501
00:27:38,961 --> 00:27:40,331
Yeah.

502
00:27:41,644 --> 00:27:43,594
Let's fast-forward a little.

503
00:27:44,917 --> 00:27:46,532
Later in the day...

504
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,802
You're about to leave c.b.i.

505
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:53,941
Van pelt's working late.
She's a hard worker.

506
00:27:54,917 --> 00:27:58,631
She might do well if she
manages not to sleep with rigsby.

507
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:00,782
Where do you go now?

508
00:28:02,512 --> 00:28:03,828
i...

509
00:28:06,229 --> 00:28:07,586
i...

510
00:28:09,612 --> 00:28:11,080
H
- home?

511
00:28:12,762 --> 00:28:14,076
Do you?

512
00:28:15,134 --> 00:28:17,118
Where... where...
where do you go, lisbon?

513
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:18,665
I'm in my car.

514
00:28:19,392 --> 00:28:20,815
It's low on gas.

515
00:28:23,133 --> 00:28:26,084
It's okay. You're in a trance state.

516
00:28:26,085 --> 00:28:27,845
Everything is okay.

517
00:28:28,489 --> 00:28:29,342
I can't...

518
00:28:29,343 --> 00:28:30,816
What do you see?

519
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,806
Where do you go?

520
00:28:33,134 --> 00:28:36,895
I... I don't... It's blank.

521
00:28:37,422 --> 00:28:39,388
I just see a blank
screen. It's all right.

522
00:28:39,389 --> 00:28:40,950
It's all right.

523
00:28:41,592 --> 00:28:42,899
I don't...

524
00:28:43,058 --> 00:28:46,354
I don't know where I went. I
- I can't remember.

525
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:47,688
I don't know where I went.

526
00:28:47,689 --> 00:28:49,656
It's okay. It's okay, it's okay.

527
00:28:50,903 --> 00:28:52,416
I can't remember.

528
00:28:53,013 --> 00:28:54,523
That's a little weird.

529
00:28:58,406 --> 00:29:00,010
I thought you were the best.

530
00:29:00,011 --> 00:29:01,651
I want my money back.

531
00:29:01,853 --> 00:29:03,774
Hmm. Yeah.

532
00:29:06,459 --> 00:29:08,550
Why can't I remember?

533
00:29:08,551 --> 00:29:10,526
It's interesting, isn't it?

534
00:29:10,527 --> 00:29:11,915
Yeah.

535
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,130
Yeah, it's interesting.

536
00:29:13,131 --> 00:29:14,436
hmm.

537
00:29:14,894 --> 00:29:17,172
Well, you know, th-thanks for trying.

538
00:29:17,784 --> 00:29:20,026
You probably have, uh,
somewhere you need to go, right?

539
00:29:20,027 --> 00:29:22,043
Well, I'm not gonna give up that easily.

540
00:29:26,285 --> 00:29:29,588
I can count on you not to
tell anybody about this, right?

541
00:29:29,589 --> 00:29:33,925
On the team? Oh, lisbon, come on.

542
00:29:33,926 --> 00:29:35,811
Hey. Jane, I just need
you to leave, okay?

543
00:29:35,812 --> 00:29:37,191
All right. Could you please go?

544
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:40,326
It's... it's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be fine, all right?

545
00:29:40,998 --> 00:29:42,382
I promise.

546
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,739
Okay? Mm-hmm.

547
00:29:57,078 --> 00:29:59,401
Tanya? I got your text.

548
00:29:59,402 --> 00:30:01,447
It said "9-1-1."
What's going on?

549
00:30:01,757 --> 00:30:04,350
oh! Hey, help, police!

550
00:30:04,362 --> 00:30:06,781
Relax, buddy.

551
00:30:06,955 --> 00:30:09,089
Yeah, we're clear. You good?

552
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:10,638
Yeah.

553
00:30:11,758 --> 00:30:13,226
You fought with mcteer
in the parking lot.

554
00:30:13,227 --> 00:30:15,485
He beat the snot out of you. That
must've been pretty humiliating.

555
00:30:15,486 --> 00:30:19,165
So you lured him into the alley and you
killed him. No, I didn't kill him. I didn't!

556
00:30:19,166 --> 00:30:20,928
Youdidkill him, david. You killed him,

557
00:30:20,929 --> 00:30:22,973
but it's our friend on the hook for it.

558
00:30:22,974 --> 00:30:25,498
Look,dog,jail is gonna be so
much better than what you get

559
00:30:25,499 --> 00:30:28,629
if you keep lying to us.
Look, your friend, the cop...

560
00:30:29,088 --> 00:30:31,614
She's the one who paid me
to bring mcteer to the alley.

561
00:30:31,615 --> 00:30:34,516
Look, I had no idea she was
gonna shoot him, I swear to you.

562
00:30:34,517 --> 00:30:37,043
I never would've taken the money
if I knew it. Agent lisbon...

563
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:40,209
She's the one who paid you? Yeah,
I mean, it had to be her, didn't it?

564
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:45,297
I heard you guys already arrested her for it. But
you're guessing, right? You never actually saw her.

565
00:30:45,485 --> 00:30:49,308
Well, I didn't see
anybody. It was all text.

566
00:30:49,533 --> 00:30:51,974
The deal was I got bill
drunk. We went out in the alley

567
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:54,283
to go take a pee, and then I split.

568
00:30:54,284 --> 00:30:57,291
I heard those shots. I
started running like hell, man.

569
00:30:57,292 --> 00:30:59,760
And the next day, there's 10
grand in my checking account.

570
00:30:59,761 --> 00:31:01,098
10 grand?

571
00:31:01,099 --> 00:31:02,939
10 grand, sam. I heard.

572
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:05,185
10 grand just to lure the
vic in, not even kill him.

573
00:31:05,186 --> 00:31:08,149
This is somebody with resources,
connections. Someone who's not lisbon.

574
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,772
Seriously, where's she
gonna get 10 grand from?

575
00:31:09,773 --> 00:31:12,254
No offense, boss. I will
have van pelt track the text.

576
00:31:12,255 --> 00:31:16,467
Cho and I will talk to the guy's bank.
Lisbon, get this through your head.

577
00:31:16,468 --> 00:31:19,210
You're relieved of duty.
You're not even supposed to be

578
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:22,113
in the building, and you
two clowns arewayout of hand.

579
00:31:22,114 --> 00:31:24,850
Let me deal with this. Come here.

580
00:31:29,992 --> 00:31:32,689
Lisbon, look at me. Look at me.

581
00:31:33,296 --> 00:31:36,667
I'll handle it. Will
you please trust me?

582
00:31:36,668 --> 00:31:39,478
I'm sorry. You don't understand.

583
00:31:39,621 --> 00:31:41,054
Later, you will.

584
00:31:41,055 --> 00:31:43,757
What are... are... are
you medicated or something?

585
00:31:43,758 --> 00:31:45,796
Okay, I'm all right. I'm fine!

586
00:31:45,797 --> 00:31:49,750
What the hell is everybody
looking at?! I'm fine!

587
00:31:50,054 --> 00:31:52,812
Just stay the hell away from
me! I'm done with this crap!

588
00:31:52,813 --> 00:31:55,873
I am done! I'm sick of this crap!

589
00:32:09,711 --> 00:32:11,177
What was that... lisbon?

590
00:32:11,178 --> 00:32:14,077
She's freaking out. Oh,
come on. It's just lisbon.

591
00:32:14,078 --> 00:32:17,140
She's a little stressed.
What is going on?

592
00:32:27,574 --> 00:32:29,024
Sorry.

593
00:32:30,224 --> 00:32:33,011
Why is this happening
to me? It's all right.

594
00:32:33,142 --> 00:32:35,638
Let's... let's go home. I'll take her.

595
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:38,404
No. Leave me alone.

596
00:33:19,309 --> 00:33:21,069
the 10 grand paid to david charles

597
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:24,035
came from an account owned by
a shell company in the caymans.

598
00:33:24,036 --> 00:33:26,702
Well, that's good. The
day after it paid david,

599
00:33:26,703 --> 00:33:30,805
the account paid out a million dollars to someone else.
I bet that's for the shooter. Can we trace the payment?

600
00:33:30,806 --> 00:33:32,993
I'm trying, but...
You'll find it dead-ends

601
00:33:32,994 --> 00:33:35,500
in a blind account that
was closed yesterday.

602
00:33:35,501 --> 00:33:37,964
Okay. Weareworking the
case. We just want to...

603
00:33:37,965 --> 00:33:40,335
Forget about it. How's lisbon?

604
00:33:40,336 --> 00:33:41,775
She's fine.

605
00:33:43,805 --> 00:33:47,016
She's fine. Well, what
did she say, exactly?

606
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:48,745
Uh, I didn't actually talk to her.

607
00:33:48,746 --> 00:33:50,749
She... she wouldn't let me in.

608
00:33:53,211 --> 00:33:55,058
You're worried about her.

609
00:33:58,432 --> 00:34:00,054
You think she might do something stupid?

610
00:34:00,055 --> 00:34:02,451
Suicide? No.

611
00:34:04,158 --> 00:34:05,920
If she did, she wouldn't
blame the bureau.

612
00:34:05,921 --> 00:34:08,033
That's not my concern at all.

613
00:34:08,876 --> 00:34:11,320
I should've taken her off-duty weapon.

614
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,349
Oh, I'm sure she'll be all right.

615
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:25,269
Minelli asked me to drop by.

616
00:34:25,319 --> 00:34:28,371
Well, ordered me to drop by, actually.

617
00:34:29,024 --> 00:34:30,193
Can we talk?

618
00:34:30,194 --> 00:34:31,413
Minelli?

619
00:34:31,414 --> 00:34:35,360
He's worried about you. We all are.

620
00:34:35,499 --> 00:34:37,284
'cause I had a meltdown,

621
00:34:37,453 --> 00:34:39,450
got perp-walked out of the cbi

622
00:34:39,451 --> 00:34:41,912
or because I killed a guy?

623
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:45,647
Wh... youkilled mcteer?

624
00:34:46,109 --> 00:34:49,230
How the hell would I know? Maybe?

625
00:34:51,616 --> 00:34:54,490
Teresa, you... you wanna
put away your glock there?

626
00:34:55,108 --> 00:34:57,777
Very good eye, doctor.

627
00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:00,573
The glock 9-millimeter.

628
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,263
The safety's in the
trigger. How stupid is that?

629
00:35:04,264 --> 00:35:08,168
I mean, it's kind of like
not having a safety at all.

630
00:35:08,169 --> 00:35:10,168
How about you give it to me?

631
00:35:12,037 --> 00:35:13,989
Don't look at me like that.

632
00:35:14,717 --> 00:35:17,653
Don't look at me like
that. This is your fault.

633
00:35:18,508 --> 00:35:19,693
Oh, whoa, teresa.

634
00:35:19,694 --> 00:35:22,050
You unlocked too many things in my head,

635
00:35:22,051 --> 00:35:24,159
and now I can't remember.

636
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,592
My head is messed up,
and it's your fault.

637
00:35:27,686 --> 00:35:31,568
Teresa... Put it down.

638
00:35:31,862 --> 00:35:33,861
You need to be calm...

639
00:35:34,467 --> 00:35:36,497
And put down the gun.

640
00:35:36,498 --> 00:35:37,948
Calm?

641
00:35:39,882 --> 00:35:41,581
You were right, doctor.

642
00:35:41,582 --> 00:35:44,286
There was something
I wanted to tell you.

643
00:35:45,449 --> 00:35:48,591
I act calm on the
outside, but on the inside,

644
00:35:48,592 --> 00:35:52,178
i'm so angry, sometimes
I think I'm gonna explode.

645
00:35:53,126 --> 00:35:55,668
All the misery and the
pain that I see every day

646
00:35:55,669 --> 00:35:58,994
makes me wanna scream,
but I lock it down.

647
00:35:59,725 --> 00:36:03,144
I lock it down because I
have to be calm and rational,

648
00:36:03,145 --> 00:36:07,072
because that's my job, but
I wanna pull this trigger.

649
00:36:07,073 --> 00:36:08,225
I wanna kill.

650
00:36:08,226 --> 00:36:10,755
You're angry. I hear that.

651
00:36:14,653 --> 00:36:16,465
I think I did it.

652
00:36:17,649 --> 00:36:19,584
I think I killed mcteer.

653
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:23,736
Oh, shh, teresa.

654
00:36:25,732 --> 00:36:29,525
If you did it, that's okay.

655
00:36:29,756 --> 00:36:31,834
He was a bad man.

656
00:36:31,861 --> 00:36:35,159
No reason for you to hurt anyone else...

657
00:36:35,548 --> 00:36:37,371
Or yourself.

658
00:36:37,854 --> 00:36:41,942
I still can't remember. You can and
you will. And when you do, teresa,

659
00:36:41,943 --> 00:36:43,935
when you push through to the truth,

660
00:36:43,936 --> 00:36:48,353
all this weight and worry
will come off your shoulders.

661
00:36:49,226 --> 00:36:50,725
Okay.

662
00:36:51,532 --> 00:36:53,391
I want you

663
00:36:53,406 --> 00:36:57,484
to visualize that scene for me.

664
00:36:58,757 --> 00:37:00,554
Relive that moment.

665
00:37:01,226 --> 00:37:03,373
You went into the alley...

666
00:37:03,374 --> 00:37:06,120
After this terrible man.

667
00:37:07,168 --> 00:37:08,881
Can you see him?

668
00:37:08,944 --> 00:37:10,354
no.

669
00:37:11,533 --> 00:37:14,684
Well, yes. Yeah, m-maybe.

670
00:37:14,685 --> 00:37:17,178
Yes. You see him.

671
00:37:17,179 --> 00:37:19,612
You see the dumpsters and the trash

672
00:37:19,613 --> 00:37:24,354
and the crumbly old brick,
and you see mcteer. Yes.

673
00:37:24,355 --> 00:37:26,963
You see there this... this monster

674
00:37:26,964 --> 00:37:29,278
who destroyed so many lives.

675
00:37:29,279 --> 00:37:30,844
It's too much.

676
00:37:30,845 --> 00:37:32,656
See it, teresa.

677
00:37:37,356 --> 00:37:38,725
Live it...

678
00:37:39,347 --> 00:37:41,096
The reek, the garbage,

679
00:37:41,097 --> 00:37:43,637
the filthy alley walls,

680
00:37:43,638 --> 00:37:46,011
the faded cross there.

681
00:37:50,127 --> 00:37:52,497
God might have mercy on william mcteer,

682
00:37:52,498 --> 00:37:54,858
but you sure as hell wouldn't.

683
00:37:54,859 --> 00:37:56,990
He deserved to die.

684
00:37:56,991 --> 00:38:00,549
But you're still a good person, teresa.

685
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:02,581
You can get through this.

686
00:38:03,652 --> 00:38:05,073
The cross?

687
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:06,558
Uh, what?

688
00:38:07,256 --> 00:38:09,744
The cross, roy.

689
00:38:10,157 --> 00:38:12,172
How did you know about the cross?

690
00:38:12,173 --> 00:38:15,276
It was inside the door.
Only the killer saw it.

691
00:38:15,587 --> 00:38:19,456
Well, teresa, you told
me about the crime scene.

692
00:38:19,457 --> 00:38:21,206
No, I didn't.

693
00:38:28,742 --> 00:38:32,060
Oh, beautifully done.

694
00:38:32,061 --> 00:38:33,433
Lovely work, lisbon.

695
00:38:33,434 --> 00:38:34,976
What are you...

696
00:38:34,977 --> 00:38:37,117
Of course... the cross.

697
00:38:37,196 --> 00:38:39,737
You couldn't resist the
imagery, could you, doc?

698
00:38:39,738 --> 00:38:42,542
Lapsed catholic,
perhaps? What's going on?

699
00:38:42,543 --> 00:38:45,702
Surrender, dorothy. We
got you. Brilliant, though.

700
00:38:45,718 --> 00:38:48,117
Made lisbon come back week after week

701
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:50,576
so you get her fingerprints
off her coffee mug

702
00:38:50,577 --> 00:38:53,967
and dose her up with, uh, lorazepam?

703
00:38:54,296 --> 00:38:56,743
Double dose for tuesday
to cause the memory loss...

704
00:38:56,744 --> 00:38:59,749
Memory loss you knew
lisbon would conceal,

705
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:02,304
which made her fail the polygraph.

706
00:39:02,763 --> 00:39:05,965
Quite the, uh, student of
human nature, huh, doctor?

707
00:39:06,257 --> 00:39:08,102
Well done, really.

708
00:39:08,103 --> 00:39:10,388
Your breakdown in cbi... That was fake?

709
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:13,216
And how good was that,
huh? What about that?

710
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:15,240
After that, all I had
to do was get minelli

711
00:39:15,241 --> 00:39:17,402
to get you to come around here.

712
00:39:17,403 --> 00:39:20,110
I've been waiting for you all
night. There was one little thing...

713
00:39:20,111 --> 00:39:22,665
I'm... I'm just...
Just one little thing.

714
00:39:22,666 --> 00:39:25,244
The lorazepam? Maybe that
went a little too far.

715
00:39:25,245 --> 00:39:27,597
When... when lisbon couldn't
remember the night of the murder

716
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:31,638
even under hypnosis, I
knew she'd been drugged.

717
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:34,491
The rest of it? Spot on.

718
00:39:34,492 --> 00:39:36,648
Very, very impressive.

719
00:39:37,396 --> 00:39:38,616
Thanks.

720
00:39:38,617 --> 00:39:40,113
Not at all.

721
00:39:43,778 --> 00:39:46,755
You're under arrest. You have
the right to remain silent.

722
00:39:46,756 --> 00:39:48,329
Anything you say or do

723
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:50,124
can and will be used
against you in court.

724
00:39:50,125 --> 00:39:52,153
You have the right to an attorney.

725
00:39:52,359 --> 00:39:54,296
So this guy who gave
you the million bucks...

726
00:39:54,297 --> 00:39:56,598
You ever met him
face-to-face? You want him?

727
00:39:56,599 --> 00:40:00,060
I want a deal... a good one.
What I got, it's worth it.

728
00:40:00,061 --> 00:40:02,139
Two to five, minimum security.

729
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,476
Oh, there won't be a
deal. We know who he is.

730
00:40:04,477 --> 00:40:06,411
Just curious ifyouknew.

731
00:40:19,303 --> 00:40:20,450
It took us a while,

732
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:23,433
but we traced the shell
company back to you, howard.

733
00:40:23,605 --> 00:40:25,692
You paid Dr. Carmen and david charles

734
00:40:25,693 --> 00:40:27,814
to frame lisbon for mcteer's murder.

735
00:40:27,815 --> 00:40:30,231
These cash transactions prove it.

736
00:40:30,232 --> 00:40:33,446
Discrediting a cop is so
much smarter than killing her.

737
00:40:33,553 --> 00:40:35,364
We'd have been all over that.

738
00:40:35,401 --> 00:40:37,972
But this way, her testimony
dies along with her career.

739
00:40:37,973 --> 00:40:39,746
How about you give us a statement?

740
00:40:39,747 --> 00:40:41,449
Maybe help yourself?

741
00:40:42,509 --> 00:40:44,415
How about you kiss me?

742
00:40:47,218 --> 00:40:48,714
You're pretty.

743
00:40:48,715 --> 00:40:53,071
So are you, compared to
most state prison inmates.

744
00:40:59,118 --> 00:41:01,603
I hear minelli's billing
you for the glass.

745
00:41:02,255 --> 00:41:03,729
It's only fair.

746
00:41:05,831 --> 00:41:09,120
You know, for a cop, you made
a very convincing lunatic.

747
00:41:10,306 --> 00:41:12,115
Jane must be proud.

748
00:41:12,396 --> 00:41:14,036
Maybe it's not good police work,

749
00:41:14,037 --> 00:41:17,185
but I have to confess, I enjoyed it.

750
00:41:17,186 --> 00:41:18,951
Letting loose for once?

751
00:41:19,665 --> 00:41:21,679
Look, I'm glad you got cleared.

752
00:41:24,459 --> 00:41:26,746
I'm sorry that we couldn't
let you in on the plan.

753
00:41:26,747 --> 00:41:29,202
You could have, but you didn't.

754
00:41:34,811 --> 00:41:38,482
You should know that if
it turned out to be you...

755
00:41:41,492 --> 00:41:44,521
I know. Just so you do.

756
00:41:45,987 --> 00:41:47,424
Enough said.

757
00:41:47,495 --> 00:41:48,850
I'm not interrupting anything, am i?

758
00:41:48,851 --> 00:41:51,354
No. Night, lisbon.

759
00:41:52,381 --> 00:41:53,782
Night, sam.

760
00:41:54,826 --> 00:41:57,170
Doughnuts from marie's. oh.

761
00:41:57,869 --> 00:42:00,396
I didn't see it. Of course.

762
00:42:00,452 --> 00:42:01,770
What?

763
00:42:02,969 --> 00:42:06,278
He's in love with you. Don't be silly.

764
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:08,429
I know, hard to fathom, but, uh,

765
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:10,866
there's no accounting
for taste, is there?

766
00:42:10,867 --> 00:42:12,255
Hush!
