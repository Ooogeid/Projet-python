00:00:01,474 --> 00:00:03,130
<i>MENTALIST /'men-t3-list/ noun</i>

2
00:00:04,432 --> 00:00:08,610
<i>Someone who uses mental
acuity, hypnosis and/or suggestion.</i>

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,330
<i>A master manipulator of
thoughts and behavior.</i>

4
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,085
<i>Leyland University, CA</i>

5
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,875
<i>STUTZER INSITUTE</i>

6
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,306
The human mind is a vast universe,

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,610
An inner cosmos that we are
only now beginning to explore.

8
00:00:35,782 --> 00:00:39,895
Our next speaker is one of the
nation's leading cosmonauts,

9
00:00:41,138 --> 00:00:44,152
A rising star in the
field of neuroscience,

10
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,208
And a prized member
of the leyland faculty.

11
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:50,382
I give you Alex Nelson.

12
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,689
No, no, no. Thank you. No. Stop.

13
00:01:31,253 --> 00:01:32,341
CBI, Rigsby.

14
00:01:33,657 --> 00:01:35,835
- Yeah.
- Jane, phone for you.

15
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,936
Someone called Sophie Miller.

16
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,441
T... t-tell her i'm not here.

17
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,795
Okay i'm sorry, ma'am. He's
not available right now.

18
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,535
No, no, no, no. Wait. Wait.

19
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,693
I'll, put you through.

20
00:01:53,667 --> 00:01:54,709
Dr. Miller?

21
00:01:55,301 --> 00:01:56,850
Yeah, this is patrick.

22
00:02:05,795 --> 00:02:08,878
If someone is murdered on the campus of
a state university, it's ours, isn't it?

23
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,839
It can be if we muscle out
the locals. Why'd you ask?

24
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,420
I need a favor.

25
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:19,736
Sophie,

26
00:02:20,051 --> 00:02:23,976
Alex Nelson's water bottle contained
a 10% solution of hydrogen cyanide.

27
00:02:24,537 --> 00:02:26,650
- What do you know about that?
- I know that hydrogen

28
00:02:26,775 --> 00:02:29,975
cyanide is a lethal poison.
Beyond that, nothing at all.

29
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,631
Please, call me "miss miller"
or "Dr. Miller" or "ma'am."

30
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,310
Not sophie, if you don't mind.

31
00:02:34,435 --> 00:02:36,858
You're not setting
the boundaries here.

32
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,118
You were seen by several witnesses arguing
with the victim shortly before his death.

33
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,162
You fled the scene
immediately after his death.

34
00:02:43,735 --> 00:02:45,456
A cunning plan, eh?

35
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:51,003
Since your divorce from
the victim two years ago,

36
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,957
You've been arrested
for assaulting him twice

37
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,801
and made several death
threats against him.

38
00:02:57,182 --> 00:02:58,363
He obtained a restraing

39
00:02:58,488 --> 00:03:00,721
- order against you.
- And i obtained one against him also.

40
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:02,723
Well, that's all right then.

41
00:03:06,322 --> 00:03:10,355
It didn't bother you that alex had remarried,
that he found happiness with another woman?

42
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:13,055
Alex and i got past
our personal history.

43
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,665
We had to, for the sake
of our work together.

44
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:19,740
Ah, yes. You worked together at
the, stutzer institute, right?

45
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,745
Which gave you ready access
to the hydrogen cyanide.

46
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,705
You know, i had thought, being
innocent, that i don't need a lawyer,

47
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,535
But i can see that you
have some animus against me,

48
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,128
So i'll say nothing more
until i have a lawyer present.

49
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,468
What if we take this case,
and it turns out she's guilty?

50
00:03:40,706 --> 00:03:42,638
- She didn't do it.
- How do you know?

51
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:46,100
Because she told me she
didn't. She wouldn't lie to me.

52
00:03:46,516 --> 00:03:47,351
Why not?

53
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:50,271
- Because she wouldn't.
- Suppose she did.

54
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:55,900
Well, if she is guilty, then we need to
catch her and punish her, but she's not.

55
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,123
Jane, i know i said i
wouldn't ask, but i'm asking.

56
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:03,325
Who is this woman?
What's the connection?

57
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,050
You don't wanna know.

58
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,010
She'll talk,
but she just needs time.

59
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,590
To do what?

60
00:04:19,053 --> 00:04:20,971
I'm not saying she's not good for it

61
00:04:21,096 --> 00:04:23,895
But we don't have enough solide
evidence to suppose that, right now.

62
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:24,975
I disagree

63
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,065
That's your right but the cbi's
lead agency on this.

64
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:28,907
Yes.

65
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:33,397
Strange, though, that a department of
justice unit like cbi is lead agency,

66
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,891
'Cause sophie miller called the
d. O. j. Switchboard this morning.

67
00:04:37,016 --> 00:04:38,527
You might almost think that she...

68
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,045
Chose her own investigators.

69
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,730
Leyland is a state university.

70
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:45,421
We automatically offer our services
when local agencies aren't equipped.

71
00:04:45,804 --> 00:04:48,137
If sophie miller called the
d. O. j., it's a coincidence.

72
00:04:49,332 --> 00:04:51,835
- Excuse me, Sir.
- What is it, Drobey?

73
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,335
This was posted up all over
leyland campus during the night.

74
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,225
"The animal equality league
has seen justice served.

75
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,530
"The blood of innocent
animals was on nelson's hands,

76
00:05:05,655 --> 00:05:08,300
And he has paid the
price for his crimes."

77
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:11,352
Looks like there's
more suspects now.

78
00:05:13,422 --> 00:05:17,585
They want the animal testing at leyland
university science department to stop,

79
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:21,665
Or "the monster stutzer will be next
to pay for his genocidal crimes."

80
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,071
Who is stutzer?

81
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:27,335
Lewis stutzer is one of the
world's foremost neuroscientists

82
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,120
And founder of the stutzer
institute at the university.

83
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:33,540
And, what is his connection
to the victim, alex nelson?

84
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:38,706
Alex nelson and sophie miller are his
colleagues, his seconds in command.

85
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:43,740
Please understand that there's a great
deal at stake here for the university.

86
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:46,637
The stutzer institute
is our lynchpin.

87
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:52,248
I came to see you in person to get your firm
assurance that this will be handled properly,

88
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:57,750
With speed and discretion and
ironclad security for Dr. Stutzer.

89
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,110
Of course, chancellor stern.
You have my absolute assurance.

90
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:05,823
I will have a squad of state marshals
around Dr. Stutzer within the hour.

91
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,800
Agent lisbon and her team will
handle the murder investigation.

92
00:06:09,003 --> 00:06:11,203
They have the highest
clearance rate in the state.

93
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,475
- Good.
- Yeah.

94
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,099
- Thank you.
- Sir.

95
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:22,235
What are you, nuts?
An animal rights case?

96
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,091
You know what a nightmare they are?

97
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,830
I know. I know. I'm sorry.

98
00:06:25,955 --> 00:06:28,355
I didn't realize it was an
animal rights case until too late.

99
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,431
And at putt, stern is
gonna be a pain in the ass.

100
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:34,226
You better close
this crap quick, lisbon.

101
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,530
Hey, thanks for not telling
him i made you take the case.

102
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,159
Lisbon? Hello?

103
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,246
Tell me the truth.

104
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,438
The truth? Darth vader?

105
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:57,875
Luke's father.

106
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:02,588
Seriously, i've stuck my stupid neck
out for you for the umpteenth time.

107
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,715
I think i deserve the truth.

108
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,847
Why is sophie miller
so important to you?

109
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,060
She was my doctor.

110
00:07:18,869 --> 00:07:20,189
She's a psychiatrist.

111
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,400
Yes, she was my psychiatrist.

112
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,053
But you hate psychiatrists,
so you always say.

113
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,162
She was a good psychiatrist.

114
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,912
She must have been if she
managed to keep you in the room.

115
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:37,940
It was a locked room.

116
00:07:48,514 --> 00:07:51,010
Yeah, i went through a rough patch,
i did a little time in a hospital,

117
00:07:51,135 --> 00:07:53,584
And sophie helped
me through that time.

118
00:07:55,423 --> 00:07:58,346
- It's not on your record.
- No. Believe me. I...

119
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,355
{\k23}It {\k15}s {\k31}not {\k38}easy {\k23}to {\k23}do.

120
00:08:07,105 --> 00:08:09,490
I know there's nothing shameful
about having a breakdown,

121
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:11,931
But i gotta confess,
i am ashamed of it.

122
00:08:16,351 --> 00:08:18,872
Thank you for being
so honest with me.

123
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,041
Sorry i kept it from you.

124
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,510
- Shall i come back later?
- No.

125
00:08:40,206 --> 00:08:43,755
Rigsby started in on the campus
security tapes. Nothing yet.

126
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,997
I've been tracking this
animal equality league.

127
00:08:46,122 --> 00:08:47,550
They're all over the internet.

128
00:08:47,675 --> 00:08:51,510
They believe in animal equality,
so you know, they're not very happy.

129
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,075
They've taken credit for
several firebombing attacks

130
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,355
on slaughterhouses and
animal testing facilities.

131
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,197
- Serious people.
- I interviewed the

132
00:08:58,322 --> 00:09:00,650
staff at the auditorium.
There's no security to speak of.

133
00:09:00,775 --> 00:09:03,360
Anyone present at the symposium
could have poisoned his water bottle.

134
00:09:03,485 --> 00:09:06,460
There are no prints on it but nelson's.
Nobody saw exactly where he got it from.

135
00:09:06,585 --> 00:09:08,249
The brand is the
same all over campus.

136
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,265
I'm kerry sheehan, Dr.
Stutzer's teaching assistant.

137
00:09:15,957 --> 00:09:17,741
He's ready to see you now.

138
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,904
Did you know alex nelson well?

139
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:23,770
He was a very good man.
He was...

140
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:26,860
He was a...

141
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:30,027
Yes? He was?

142
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:33,197
He was a good, good man.

143
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,631
Dr. Stutzer?

144
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:49,630
We're with the cbi.

145
00:09:50,253 --> 00:09:52,375
Yeah. Yes, of course. Come in.

146
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,510
And shut that door, please.
Sit down.

147
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,974
Terrible, terrible business.

148
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,560
Alex was a first-rate
researcher. Truly first-rate.

149
00:10:04,685 --> 00:10:06,813
I cannot tell you how much
i am going to miss him.

150
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,827
I'm sorry, Dr. Stutzer.

151
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,400
We wanted to talk to you a little about the threats

152
00:10:11,525 --> 00:10:13,915
couldn't have come at
a worse time, of course.

153
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,615
It's going to set us back
months, i'm afraid. Months.

154
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,867
What is it you do here
exactly, Dr. Stutzer?

155
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,953
Our work here is highly sensitive.

156
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:25,123
What you tell us regarding your
work is completely confidential.

157
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,752
All cbi agents sign a binding
nondisclosure agreement.

158
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,274
Very well.

159
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:34,356
I will tell you
what we're doing here.

160
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,162
We're curing evil.

161
00:10:38,063 --> 00:10:39,690
We're banishing the devil.

162
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,285
We have identified

163
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:42,958
a section of the brain

164
00:10:43,386 --> 00:10:45,940
that governs moral decision making.

165
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,063
It's a small fold of tissue

166
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:52,192
called the cingulate gyrus
here in the medial part of the brain.

167
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:55,612
This is the source of good and evil.

168
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,819
We've learned how
it works and how to

169
00:10:57,944 --> 00:11:00,445
readjust it when it
does not work properly.

170
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:04,121
We've created what we
call a morality engine.

171
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,400
A morality engine?

172
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,216
You... are skeptical.

173
00:11:11,063 --> 00:11:12,270
Nevertheless, it's true.

174
00:11:12,395 --> 00:11:14,742
We are plumbing the
depths of the human soul.

175
00:11:14,867 --> 00:11:16,807
Do you know what's down there?
Do you know,

176
00:11:16,932 --> 00:11:18,510
what your soul is made of?

177
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:21,471
Frogs and snails
and puppy dogs'tails?

178
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,328
Humor.

179
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:25,666
Good.

180
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:28,571
Thank you, no.

181
00:11:29,745 --> 00:11:31,231
Your soul is electricity.

182
00:11:31,638 --> 00:11:35,114
The essence of your being is a
series of

183
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:37,845
rapid electrical impulses.

184
00:11:38,181 --> 00:11:40,782
Morality is a binary
switch system in the brain,

185
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,618
And we are learning how to
control that switch system.

186
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,211
Where do animals come into this?

187
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:49,708
Well, we aren't allowed to
poke around inside human heads

188
00:11:50,056 --> 00:11:53,492
Until we have done the same
things on animals first.

189
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:06,364
This

190
00:12:06,489 --> 00:12:07,476
is susie.

191
00:12:09,201 --> 00:12:12,694
When she first arrived, she was
quite violent, especially over food.

192
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,515
We recalibrated her
anterior cingulate gyrus,

193
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,864
And now look what a happy
and generous girl she is.

194
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,318
Thank you.

195
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,170
Where'd it go?

196
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,397
Is susie here the extent
of your animal testing?

197
00:12:53,566 --> 00:12:56,628
Oh, no. There's been other chimpanzees
before her,

198
00:12:56,753 --> 00:12:59,226
rats, mice, pigeons.

199
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,345
Have you ever been threatened by
animal rights activists before now?

200
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,450
Yes, of course.

201
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,080
When one is a prominent scientist, one
is sometimes menaced by animal people.

202
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,082
It's always nonsense.

203
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,835
In this case, we must assume
the threats are very real.

204
00:13:15,157 --> 00:13:18,338
The marshals will provide you with full
protection, but you're gonna need to be careful.

205
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,257
I am not intimidated.

206
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,952
The work we are doing
here is far too important.

207
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,325
That is why i have this.

208
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,079
In the long term,

209
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,827
this technology

210
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:35,765
has the potential to
eradicate violence from human relations.

211
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:38,640
That is what these animal
rights maniacs don't understand.

212
00:13:38,765 --> 00:13:42,661
We are trying to create a world
of peace where everyone is safe.

213
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,160
From monkey attacks?

214
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:48,076
More humor.

215
00:13:52,145 --> 00:13:53,056
Come this way.

216
00:13:58,401 --> 00:14:00,626
We are well past animal testing...

217
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,928
And into the first stages
of testing on humans.

218
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,891
Question five...
a house is on fire.

219
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:14,811
You can save "A",
a field case full of money

220
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:17,772
or "B", a homeless man.

221
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,025
Which do you choose?

222
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,266
"B".

223
00:14:26,362 --> 00:14:28,202
Forget about the
animal equality league.

224
00:14:28,327 --> 00:14:31,210
Weshould firebomb the place. The
guy's gonna put us out of a job.

225
00:14:31,335 --> 00:14:34,748
I can't see it. Human beings are
more than just electrical appliances.

226
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:35,707
Patrick.

227
00:14:37,453 --> 00:14:38,288
Dr. Miller.

228
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,382
Sophie.

229
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,054
This is, agent Lisbon.

230
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,472
Hello.

231
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,720
- I'm gonna wait in the car.
- All right.

232
00:14:59,614 --> 00:15:00,895
Thanks for getting me out.

233
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:04,152
Oh, it wasn't me. It was the animal
equality league that sprung you.

234
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,738
It's the thought that counts.

235
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:11,710
- How have you been doing?
- Good. Very good.

236
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,746
- You?
- I've had my issues.

237
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,462
Well, i...

238
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,417
I don't know why that
should surprise me.

239
00:15:19,824 --> 00:15:23,672
I suppose most patients assume their
doctors have no problems themselves.

240
00:15:23,947 --> 00:15:25,507
Well, who'd consult a sick doctor?

241
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,513
It's one of the reasons i left clinical
practice and went into pure research.

242
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,058
What are they exactly, your issues?

243
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,435
I mean, what's the story
with you and alex nelson?

244
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,843
Assault? Restraining orders?

245
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:43,880
What can i say? I'm just
drawn to controlling

246
00:15:44,005 --> 00:15:46,152
but damaged and
emotionally unavailable men.

247
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,867
- You and alex made a truce?
- Yeah.

248
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,579
But you were arguing
just before he died.

249
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:59,165
About work.
Is this an interrogation?

250
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,590
No, no. I'm s... i'm sorry.

251
00:16:01,715 --> 00:16:03,669
I was just wondering
about the logic of it all.

252
00:16:04,183 --> 00:16:05,351
What logic?

253
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,820
Oh, you saved my life. I owe you.

254
00:16:07,945 --> 00:16:10,635
I would do anything to repay
that debt. You know that, right?

255
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,537
But you're innocent,

256
00:16:13,662 --> 00:16:15,967
so why do you need my help?

257
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,185
Why am i here?

258
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:20,729
Maybe i just wanted
to see you again.

259
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:25,766
Now i have.

260
00:16:28,963 --> 00:16:30,447
Good-bye, patrick.

261
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:45,128
Patrick, my name is sophie miller.

262
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:47,386
I'm gonna help you get better.

263
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:04,397
I got a partial plate,

264
00:17:04,766 --> 00:17:06,650
which gets us a list
of about 2,000 vehicles.

265
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,684
Take a look at the back window.

266
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,935
It looks like a cat or a dog.

267
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:15,050
It's a bear. The northwestern
oregon state bear.

268
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:19,195
So van pelt cross-referenced that vehicle list
with alumni of northwestern oregon state...

269
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,581
Which gets us five names...
all clean, no criminal records,

270
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,335
No animal rights activism,
all living quietly in oregon.

271
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:29,891
But one guy sold his van six months
ago to a company based in sacramento.

272
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,010
A...

273
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:35,512
Company with no apparent business
and no registered employees

274
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,681
based out of one of those
warehouses by the river.

275
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,058
Nice work.

276
00:17:43,381 --> 00:17:45,065
We've been monitoring
the building closely.

277
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,578
- So far, nobody's gone in or come out.
- We don't know how many

278
00:17:47,703 --> 00:17:50,402
- people are in there.
- This could get nasty.

279
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:34,358
Police!Freeze!
Let me see your hands!

280
00:18:43,879 --> 00:18:46,207
Yeah, i killed nelson.
He had it coming.

281
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:49,586
And i'm gonna kill stutzer, too,
for what he's doing to the animals.

282
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:50,945
He's got it coming.

283
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,601
What's he doing to the animals?

284
00:18:53,286 --> 00:18:55,633
Hey, can i go now?
I gotta feed the cats.

285
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,137
They get hungry, you
know, and they get mad,

286
00:19:00,008 --> 00:19:02,535
and they pee on
my computer keyboard,

287
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,099
And it really screws up my work.

288
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:06,545
We won't keep you here
any longer than we need to.

289
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,726
Now this animal equality
league... tell me about it.

290
00:19:09,241 --> 00:19:14,035
It's a league of people who believe
that animals should be equal to humans.

291
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,029
I'm chair of the
league's supreme council.

292
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,833
He's crazy.

293
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,615
Yeah, crazy don't make him innocent.

294
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,161
Crazy's what makes
people kill other people.

295
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:26,184
How did you kill nelson?

296
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,805
- Poison.
- What kind of poison did you use?

297
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:31,795
- Wouldn't you like to know?
- I do know. I'm wondering if you do.

298
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,783
Do you realize that the real
rulers of this planet...

299
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:36,804
Are insects?

300
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:40,534
Okay.

301
00:19:41,482 --> 00:19:42,931
Crazy innocent, probably.

302
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,876
Okay. Yeah.

303
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:53,843
Keep him locked up until forensics
have swept his stuff, just in case.

304
00:19:54,134 --> 00:19:56,866
Call mental health services.
Have them take a look at him.

305
00:19:57,317 --> 00:20:00,227
Looks like the animal
rights angle's a dead end.

306
00:20:00,585 --> 00:20:02,845
- Back to square one.
- The grieving widow?

307
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:05,451
- That's always a good place to start.
- Yes, i think so.

308
00:20:05,576 --> 00:20:07,667
Flowers for a funeral.
I don't know how many flowers,

309
00:20:07,792 --> 00:20:09,695
you supposed to happen
at the memorial service.

310
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,818
Is three arrangements too few?

311
00:20:12,947 --> 00:20:14,905
Well, how much do lies cost?

312
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:20,696
Maybe you should just speak to chancellor
stern. He might have a better idea.

313
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,025
I'm sorry. Death is so complicated.

314
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:28,893
I'm expected to answer all
these questions about everything.

315
00:20:29,149 --> 00:20:31,637
- Mrs. Nelson, i just...
- please call me emily.

316
00:20:31,762 --> 00:20:34,315
I never really got the hang
of being called "nelson."

317
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,567
Can we sit?

318
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,290
I was just getting the hang of being
a newlywed, and now i'm a widow.

319
00:20:45,668 --> 00:20:47,408
Did you ever get
any sense that there was

320
00:20:47,533 --> 00:20:49,995
anything wrong in any
aspect of alex's life?

321
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,738
No, i don't think so.

322
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:54,294
I mean, work had been really
hard lately. I know that.

323
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,093
Is that you?

324
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:01,342
Yes, that's when
alex and i first met.

325
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,373
Cute picture.

326
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:05,858
Why was work so hard?

327
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:07,724
I don't know.

328
00:21:07,995 --> 00:21:10,735
When alex would talk about his
work, i couldn't understand a word,

329
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,354
And he just stopped
trying after a while.

330
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:17,166
But he had an argument on
the phone a few weeks ago.

331
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,205
Alex went into his office,
and i could hear him shouting.

332
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:23,823
He was so angry. He never shouts.

333
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,625
Any idea who he was shouting at?

334
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,280
I know it was a woman.

335
00:21:28,046 --> 00:21:29,990
Rosie, i think he called her.

336
00:21:30,215 --> 00:21:31,013
Rosie.

337
00:21:31,727 --> 00:21:33,930
Do you know anybody named rosie?

338
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,610
- No.
- Did you ever ask him

339
00:21:36,735 --> 00:21:39,088
- about the phone call?
- I did. He said it was a work thing.

340
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,424
- And you believed him?
- Yeah.

341
00:21:41,794 --> 00:21:44,093
You didn't suspect that there
was another woman involved?

342
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:45,653
No.

343
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:49,358
Sorry. I have to
ask such things. Sorry.

344
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:53,728
You have a beautiful house.
Beautiful. Did you do the decorating?

345
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:55,448
No, it's all alex.

346
00:21:56,255 --> 00:21:58,066
He was teaching me.
He had an aesthetic.

347
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,656
It keeps doing
that every five minutes.

348
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,451
What am i gonna do?

349
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:16,095
When this funeral stuff is
done with and alex is buried,

350
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,838
I want you to go
someplace beautiful.

351
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,335
Just get on a plane.

352
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,339
Don't tell anyone where
you're going. Just go.

353
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:24,467
Fly away and start building
a new life for yourself.

354
00:22:25,899 --> 00:22:26,880
- Okay.
- Okay.

355
00:22:27,005 --> 00:22:31,599
But you promise me you will fight hard
against your weakness for control freaks.

356
00:22:32,111 --> 00:22:34,834
- Okay.
- Good. Good.

357
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:37,345
- I'm sorry.
- No.

358
00:22:40,367 --> 00:22:43,335
She couldn't kill anyone unless
they told her to in a firm voice.

359
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,475
That's funny.

360
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,765
"Don't listen to control
freaks." "Whatever you say, sir."

361
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:50,093
Let's go see stutzer's assistant.

362
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:53,390
Kerry sheehan? What, you think
she's the mysterious rosie?

363
00:22:53,515 --> 00:22:55,725
The widow's not a true
blonde. She's naturally dark.

364
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,376
- Is that you?
- Yes. That's when alex and i first met.

365
00:22:58,962 --> 00:22:59,752
And what?

366
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:02,715
And her hair is colored and
styled to look like sophie...

367
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,025
Only younger... who was a
brunet when i knew her.

368
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,055
So nelson was a control
freak, like you said.

369
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:10,722
A control freak with a serious thing for
getting his women to dye their hair blond.

370
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,807
Kerry sheehan has roots.

371
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,267
Yes, she does.

372
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:17,145
- She and alex nelson were having an affair.
- Bravo.

373
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:18,945
Don't patronize me.

374
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:27,567
Miss sheehan?

375
00:23:28,328 --> 00:23:29,117
Kerry?

376
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,227
It's teresa lisbon.

377
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,370
We want to talk to
you about alex nelson.

378
00:23:41,993 --> 00:23:43,796
I need e. M. t. S at 9-6-5 elm.

379
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,012
He was good, good man.

380
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,867
Tell them not to run the lights.

381
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,106
<i>FORGIVE ME</i>

382
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,525
Looks like a suicide.

383
00:24:11,754 --> 00:24:13,310
Is it what it looks like, you think?

384
00:24:13,435 --> 00:24:15,890
Yeah. How pink she was?
That's cyanide.

385
00:24:16,015 --> 00:24:17,995
It causes high
blood-oxygen saturation.

386
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:18,966
Thanks.

387
00:24:20,672 --> 00:24:22,090
Look at this, boss.

388
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,700
I found these in
the garbage upstairs.

389
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,655
That's alex with the victim.

390
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:38,109
It's not a tidy end to this sad
saga, but it is an end, at least.

391
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:41,872
Thank you for all your hard work.

392
00:24:41,997 --> 00:24:43,485
We're not done here, i'm afraid.

393
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:47,305
If kerry sheehan was a suicide, that
doesn't make her guilty of alex's murder.

394
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:49,278
If she's a suicide?

395
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:57,615
The note's too brief for a woman.
Women like to explain themselves.

396
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,245
I think it's a staged suicide.

397
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:01,833
Perhaps she was too ashamed of
what she'd done to talk of it.

398
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:04,415
She had enough pills to
kill herself ten times over.

399
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,985
And hoarding pills is
characteristic of the suicidal type.

400
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:10,822
Yes, But why would she kill herself with
the hydrogen cyanide, with terrible pain,

401
00:25:10,947 --> 00:25:12,314
When she'd collected pills that

402
00:25:12,439 --> 00:25:14,925
- would let her slip away gently?
- Well, maybe she wanted the pain.

403
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:17,707
She need the pain to punish
herself for killing her lover.

404
00:25:17,832 --> 00:25:19,953
You really want this
case to be over, don't you?

405
00:25:20,078 --> 00:25:20,948
Don't you?

406
00:25:21,073 --> 00:25:23,030
Actually, no. I want
to find out the truth.

407
00:25:23,155 --> 00:25:24,846
And if kerry didn't
kill herself, then...

408
00:25:24,971 --> 00:25:27,233
- the widow had a motive.
- Yeah, but not the temperament.

409
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:29,318
There's no way she's a killer.

410
00:25:29,592 --> 00:25:31,320
That leaves one obvious suspect.

411
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:34,991
Sophie.

412
00:25:35,425 --> 00:25:36,605
Look at her record.

413
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:39,579
She and alex were violently
obsessed with each other.

414
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:41,622
Maybe they were still
secretly involved.

415
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:44,327
- Maybe she was jealous of kerry.
- Yeah, but why kill kerry

416
00:25:44,452 --> 00:25:46,537
- and leave Emily unharmed?
- And how did she even know

417
00:25:46,662 --> 00:25:48,796
- Kerry was sleeping with Alex?
- Let's go ask her.

418
00:25:56,865 --> 00:25:59,222
Let's keep it casual to start
with sophie. Let her relax.

419
00:25:59,347 --> 00:26:01,475
If she gets her guard up,
we'll get nothing from her.

420
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,926
You're very combative
all the sudden.

421
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,850
No, if she is guilty, she
lied to me, and i believed it.

422
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,287
She fooled me.

423
00:26:09,412 --> 00:26:11,630
- The ultimate sin.
- Yes, it is.

424
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:16,845
You're adrift in a lifeboat.

425
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:18,973
You can save ten small
children by pushing

426
00:26:19,098 --> 00:26:21,440
one 60-year-old man out of the boat.

427
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,889
- Yes or no?

428
00:26:23,212 --> 00:26:24,010
- No.

429
00:26:25,481 --> 00:26:27,205
You're adrift in a lifeboat.

430
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:30,079
You can save ten small
children by not helping

431
00:26:30,204 --> 00:26:32,408
one 60-year-old man into the boat.

432
00:26:32,992 --> 00:26:33,704
Yes

433
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:34,809
or no?

434
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:36,325
Yes.

435
00:26:37,521 --> 00:26:41,050
That's it. If you could just wait for greg
to release you from the chair, you can go.

436
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,934
And thank you very
much for your help.

437
00:26:43,597 --> 00:26:46,187
Really, both dilemmas are exactly
the same...

438
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:48,029
One life for ten...

439
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,570
But almost everyone answers the
set of questions the same way.

440
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:55,160
It's the most basic human morality...
the value we place on a human life

441
00:26:55,285 --> 00:26:57,055
And when we're willing
to sacrifice it.

442
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,200
But watch.

443
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:01,030
If i run a current of electricity
through this part of the brain,

444
00:27:01,155 --> 00:27:04,789
I can provoke a response that totally
bypasses any conscious thought.

445
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:08,487
I can manipulate the subject's
moral reasoning towards good,

446
00:27:08,612 --> 00:27:11,542
And if i want, the reverse,
toward evil.

447
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:15,800
Now you know, obviously there are
complex ethical issues involved.

448
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:20,388
So we've recalibrated the test subjects
just enough to prove our findings,

449
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:23,395
Because we don't want to get too
far ahead of public sentiment.

450
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,768
Theoretically, this way, villains...

451
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,165
And...

452
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:29,880
this way, saints.

453
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:33,776
Yes, in simple terms.

454
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:35,382
I must have a try.

455
00:27:35,936 --> 00:27:37,385
You gotta let me have a try.

456
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,434
Really?

457
00:27:38,947 --> 00:27:40,992
As test subject or controller?

458
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,925
Controllers? You... you call them
controllers? That's brilliant.

459
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:45,910
I'll do either.
I'd like to do both.

460
00:27:46,035 --> 00:27:48,165
Really? I'm so glad
that we've amused you.

461
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,625
- Dr. Miller?
- Yes?

462
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,575
I assume you've heard
about kerry sheehan's death.

463
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,037
Yes, it's tragic.

464
00:27:55,412 --> 00:27:57,225
Do you think that she killed alex?

465
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:59,109
Is there somewhere we
can talk in private?

466
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,387
Sounds so ominous.

467
00:28:01,773 --> 00:28:03,915
We could do it downtown
with lawyers present,

468
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,350
But i thought it'd be more
congenial to talk here.

469
00:28:06,925 --> 00:28:08,755
You're right, and i'm
happy to talk to you,

470
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,003
'Cause i understand you're
just trying to do your job.

471
00:28:11,642 --> 00:28:12,932
We were wondering,

472
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,395
did you know
kerry and alex were having an affair?

473
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,779
Well, i knew she was having an affair
with a married man because she told me.

474
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,135
I didn't know it was alex.
I didn't put it together.

475
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,200
She told you that.
You were close, then?

476
00:28:23,325 --> 00:28:24,410
No, not really.

477
00:28:25,629 --> 00:28:27,621
She had to have known
you were alex's ex.

478
00:28:27,975 --> 00:28:29,787
Why would she talk
to you, of all people?

479
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,762
I don't know.

480
00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:35,717
You're a psychiatrist.
Give it a shot.

481
00:28:36,112 --> 00:28:37,191
My guess...

482
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:41,360
Is that she was a silly little
girl who liked the secret drama of it all

483
00:28:41,485 --> 00:28:45,617
And the safety of the rules that would prevent
me from slapping her senseless, if i'd found out.

484
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:47,555
Why would you slap her for that?

485
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,310
You didn't care about alex anymore.

486
00:28:49,976 --> 00:28:53,147
I cared nothing at all for him,
but i don't like being played with.

487
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,290
Were you still involved in a
physical relationship with him?

488
00:28:56,415 --> 00:28:57,124
No.

489
00:28:57,930 --> 00:28:58,820
Who's rosie?

490
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:00,895
Rosie.

491
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,366
I can't say that i
know anybody with that name.

492
00:29:04,282 --> 00:29:05,865
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

493
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:08,079
Why? Was that alex's other woman?

494
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:12,339
Emily heard alex arguing with a
woman she thought was called rosie.

495
00:29:16,033 --> 00:29:18,089
Lisbon, would you leave
us alone for a moment?

496
00:29:19,892 --> 00:29:20,800
No problem.

497
00:29:23,305 --> 00:29:24,291
Thank you.

498
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,015
What?

499
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:33,979
I know you're feeling powerless
right now, but you're in control.

500
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,325
You have a choice.

501
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:38,776
You can choose to let evil
defeat you, or you can fight back.

502
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,155
You can fight, or you
can give up and die.

503
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,739
It's your choice.

504
00:29:46,767 --> 00:29:49,397
I asked lisbon to
leave us because you...

505
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,372
Gave me my life back,

506
00:29:52,137 --> 00:29:54,333
and i owe you
the chance to do the right thing.

507
00:29:54,677 --> 00:29:55,493
Which is?

508
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:57,128
Tell me the truth.

509
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:59,454
I told you i don't know
anybody with that name.

510
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,095
What about a monkey?

511
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:03,543
Did you know a monkey
with that name?

512
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,414
- Yes.
- 'Cause that's...

513
00:30:09,864 --> 00:30:10,762
Rosie...

514
00:30:11,681 --> 00:30:13,027
In there, isn't it?

515
00:30:13,597 --> 00:30:14,353
Yes.

516
00:30:14,596 --> 00:30:17,815
You switched her with susie because
susie never did get gentle, did she?

517
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,045
No.

518
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:22,245
The morality engine doesn't
work, does it? It's all phooey.

519
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,865
And... and this guy... professor lewis
stutzer... he's the wizard of oz.

520
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:26,753
No.

521
00:30:27,151 --> 00:30:28,267
We are this...

522
00:30:28,592 --> 00:30:29,365
close.

523
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:31,036
We are this close to cracking this.

524
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,477
We're on the edge of...
of a revolutionary break...

525
00:30:33,602 --> 00:30:34,965
"on the edge"? Sophie.

526
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:40,105
This building, this institute, this whole
multimillion dollar project is based on a sham.

527
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:41,172
Yes or no?

528
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:43,924
Yes...

529
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:46,469
It's a sham.

530
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:49,713
We've been falsifying
data for almost a year now

531
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,749
to make it look like it
works, but it doesn't.

532
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,046
Why lie about it? It's... it was...

533
00:30:57,249 --> 00:30:58,902
Bound to be discovered.

534
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,488
Pride, delusion,

535
00:31:04,202 --> 00:31:05,029
greed.

536
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:08,528
You have to understand.
Lewis stutzer is a genius.

537
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:13,935
This project is the
culmination of his life's work.

538
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:16,415
I so desperately wanted it to work.

539
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,258
We all did.

540
00:31:20,389 --> 00:31:22,493
And we began to believe the
lies that we were telling.

541
00:31:22,802 --> 00:31:24,882
And alex threatened to
expose the whole thing.

542
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:28,302
He was going to at the symposium
that morning. He was gonna confess.

543
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:31,920
I begged him. I begged him not to.
It'd be the end of our careers.

544
00:31:32,045 --> 00:31:33,682
It'd be the end ofeverything.

545
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:35,789
So you killed him

546
00:31:36,009 --> 00:31:38,413
and kerry
to cover this whole thing up.

547
00:31:40,713 --> 00:31:41,587
Look at me.

548
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:44,696
I had nothing to do with the deaths.

549
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:47,775
- I promise.
- Who was it?

550
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:53,162
- Stutzer?
- I-i don't... i don't know.

551
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,870
You knew they were both
killed to cover this thing up,

552
00:31:55,995 --> 00:31:58,165
and yet you didn't say a word to me.

553
00:32:01,713 --> 00:32:03,925
That's why you asked
me to help you, isn't it?

554
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:05,900
Because you thought you
could push my buttons.

555
00:32:06,025 --> 00:32:08,319
You thought you could manipulate
me into exonerating you.

556
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,780
Sophie, look at me.

557
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:14,363
I don't care about the fraud,

558
00:32:14,697 --> 00:32:16,985
but if you
had anything to do with those murders...

559
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:20,476
If you had anything at all
to do with those murders...

560
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,875
Now is the time to walk away.

561
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,151
Walk away and get
on a plane to brazil.

562
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,953
Thank you, doctor.

563
00:32:48,484 --> 00:32:49,460
Good-bye.

564
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,848
Good-bye, patrick. Be well.

565
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:03,105
I had nothing to
do with the murders.

566
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:13,080
No, no, no, no, no. I-i don't
like the sound of that at all.

567
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,768
That's a crazy idea.

568
00:33:16,988 --> 00:33:18,335
Yeah. Absolutely.

569
00:33:18,805 --> 00:33:20,993
All right. Will do, boss. Thanks.

570
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,993
He said, go ahead. Fine.

571
00:33:27,066 --> 00:33:28,305
Loves the idea.

572
00:33:31,069 --> 00:33:32,140
Professor stutzer.

573
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:35,080
- We've done it.
- What?

574
00:33:35,205 --> 00:33:37,560
- The morality engine works.
- It works?

575
00:33:37,685 --> 00:33:40,035
I was showing the policemen
how the brain scanner works,

576
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,043
- But the synchronous oscillator kept tripping off...
- Yes, it's been doing that.

577
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:45,230
So i decided to bypass
the differential filters.

578
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:47,541
I think it's producing an
ion flow into the dendrite.

579
00:33:47,666 --> 00:33:48,950
- But how?
- I don't know.

580
00:33:49,075 --> 00:33:50,822
I don't know how
it works, but it works.

581
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:53,280
This is his baseline
before recalibration...

582
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:56,680
And after.

583
00:33:57,607 --> 00:33:58,753
You sure about this?

584
00:33:59,063 --> 00:34:01,215
I've checked and rechecked
the results. Watch.

585
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,654
I'm gonna optimize
his moral clarity.

586
00:34:04,601 --> 00:34:06,013
Question 65B...

587
00:34:06,413 --> 00:34:08,712
A gunman is going to
shoot an innocent child.

588
00:34:09,132 --> 00:34:11,834
You can save the child
by jumping in front of the gun

589
00:34:11,959 --> 00:34:13,615
but it will cost you your life

590
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,842
Do you "A", give up your life

591
00:34:16,336 --> 00:34:18,389
or "B", let the child die?

592
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,562
"A."

593
00:34:19,944 --> 00:34:22,033
And now i'm gonna make him evil.

594
00:34:22,413 --> 00:34:26,355
Question 98... you are stranded
on an island with a stranger

595
00:34:26,705 --> 00:34:30,358
You find a food supply but there
only have to keep one person alive.

596
00:34:30,743 --> 00:34:33,971
If you do not share the food,
your survival is garanted

597
00:34:34,253 --> 00:34:36,600
but the stranger will starve.

598
00:34:36,725 --> 00:34:37,695
Do you "A",

599
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,103
share the food,

600
00:34:39,228 --> 00:34:41,764
or "B", keep the food for yourself?

601
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:42,805
"B".

602
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:43,685
See?

603
00:34:43,888 --> 00:34:44,836
It works.

604
00:34:45,445 --> 00:34:46,600
It does work.

605
00:34:47,529 --> 00:34:48,752
It really works.

606
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,864
We must tell the
chancellor that it works.

607
00:34:54,037 --> 00:34:55,551
Eating people is wrong...

608
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,132
true or false?

609
00:34:57,257 --> 00:34:58,015
False.

610
00:34:58,263 --> 00:34:59,462
Question 95...

611
00:34:59,884 --> 00:35:04,055
seeing another human being
in pain is pleasant... true or false?

612
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:04,977
True.

613
00:35:05,917 --> 00:35:06,762
Well done.

614
00:35:07,223 --> 00:35:09,015
Well done. Thank the lord!

615
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,690
I-i told you i would
succeed in the end.

616
00:35:11,815 --> 00:35:14,552
Yes, you did. You
certainly did, didn't you?

617
00:35:16,022 --> 00:35:18,910
- Mr. Jane?
- Mr. Jane, i haven't restored your normal calibration.

618
00:35:19,035 --> 00:35:20,182
Don't worry about it.

619
00:35:20,307 --> 00:35:22,020
But he's been calibrated for evil.

620
00:35:22,145 --> 00:35:22,852
Sir.

621
00:35:24,301 --> 00:35:26,325
Sir, please, follow Dr.
Miller's advice.

622
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:28,369
You do not understand
what has happened to you.

623
00:35:28,494 --> 00:35:31,510
Yes i understand. Your morality
engine works. It made me into a good man.

624
00:35:31,635 --> 00:35:33,485
No, you do not understand.

625
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:35,000
It is the exact opposite.

626
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:37,128
No, doc, you don't understand.

627
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,409
What are you doing?

628
00:35:42,736 --> 00:35:44,182
Put the phone down.

629
00:35:45,232 --> 00:35:46,143
Thank you.

630
00:35:46,851 --> 00:35:48,765
You know why i'm
alive on this planet?

631
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:50,178
My sole purpose?

632
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:55,804
I catch bad people and punish them.
That's all i do, because when i do that,

633
00:35:55,929 --> 00:35:57,868
i know i'm doing something good,
you see?

634
00:35:57,993 --> 00:36:00,598
- Yes. Yes.
- Good people do good things.

635
00:36:01,353 --> 00:36:03,698
- Bad people do bad things.
- Th-that... that's true.

636
00:36:03,823 --> 00:36:06,395
Yes. Now let's test
your moral baseline.

637
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:08,259
Question 99...

638
00:36:08,972 --> 00:36:11,502
Who killed alex
nelson and kerry sheehan?

639
00:36:12,821 --> 00:36:13,796
I don't know.

640
00:36:14,275 --> 00:36:15,955
That's not an acceptable answer.

641
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,635
Tell me the truth, or
i will kill that woman.

642
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,636
I am telling you the truth.

643
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:24,681
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

644
00:36:25,806 --> 00:36:26,833
Oh, my god.

645
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:32,463
Okay,

646
00:36:33,182 --> 00:36:36,155
now that we've established
some real test parameters,

647
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:39,375
Tell me who killed alex
nelson and kerry sheehan,

648
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,323
Or i will shoot
your good friend here.

649
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:45,406
And then if you still don't give me
an honest answer, i will kill you.

650
00:36:45,761 --> 00:36:48,183
My good man, i cannot tell
you what i do not know.

651
00:36:48,308 --> 00:36:50,708
- I need an answer.
- It was me. It was...

652
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:53,945
- It was me. It was me.
- You?

653
00:36:54,346 --> 00:36:56,922
- Why?
- I killed them. I'm sorry Lewis.

654
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:59,633
I was only trying to protect you.

655
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,176
I need evidence.

656
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,931
In... in my basement in a
charcoal lighter fluid bottle.

657
00:37:06,469 --> 00:37:08,684
- What's in the bottle?
- Cyanide.

658
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:10,382
Why did you do it?

659
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,063
To protect the university.

660
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:18,377
Alex was going to expose the
stutzer institute as a fraud.

661
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:23,681
The... the university's finances
are... are based on stutzer's reputation.

662
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:28,453
If stutzer goes down,
leyland university goes down.

663
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:32,285
And kerry came to you after alex died,
said that alex had told her everything.

664
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:35,335
She was gonna expose stutzer, not
just as a fraud, but as a murderer.

665
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,920
Yes. Yeah.

666
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,055
Where in the basement
is that bottle?

667
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:42,365
Top shelf on the
left as you... as you...

668
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,060
As you come down the stairs.

669
00:37:44,185 --> 00:37:46,850
I bet you keep a nice,
neat basement.

670
00:37:46,975 --> 00:37:48,640
What was in that bottle again?

671
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:49,706
Cyanide.

672
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:55,105
Sophie, you can get up now.

673
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,983
See? The blood...
totally worth it.

674
00:37:58,205 --> 00:38:01,165
It's always those little details
that help sell the whole thing.

675
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:03,282
That was... that was great.

676
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:06,655
It's all inadmissible.

677
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:11,163
I-i said what i had to say to... to save
myself from this lunatic with a gun.

678
00:38:11,966 --> 00:38:12,990
It's inadmissible.

679
00:38:13,115 --> 00:38:15,500
She knows, but knowing the
truth is important, too.

680
00:38:17,571 --> 00:38:20,087
- Top shelf left or right, did you say?
- Left.

681
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,759
We have agents at your house
right now with a search warrant.

682
00:38:24,545 --> 00:38:25,661
Inadmissible.

683
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,641
Yes. I'd hate to
be a state's attorney.

684
00:38:28,766 --> 00:38:31,600
Jane's always pulling crap like
this on them. But they always win.

685
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:34,311
In the meantime, you're
under arrest. Cho?

686
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:37,593
- Would you?
- Put your hands on your head.

687
00:38:37,718 --> 00:38:39,770
- Thank you.
- You have the right to remain silent.

688
00:38:39,895 --> 00:38:42,635
Anything you say can and will be
held against you in a court of law.

689
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,292
You have the right to have an
attorney present during questioning.

690
00:38:45,417 --> 00:38:47,282
You cannot abording attorney...

691
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,993
The engine doesn't work?

692
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:54,600
You were pretending.

693
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:57,045
It doesn't work.

694
00:38:57,768 --> 00:38:58,792
Pretending.

695
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,161
To catch the chancellor...

696
00:39:02,524 --> 00:39:04,101
Or me, i suppose. You...

697
00:39:04,721 --> 00:39:05,960
Couldn't know which.

698
00:39:06,085 --> 00:39:07,418
No, i thought it was you.

699
00:39:09,052 --> 00:39:10,305
Very clever.

700
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:15,143
I so badly wanted to
believe that it worked.

701
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:17,993
Mind plays tricks, huh?

702
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:21,522
Well...

703
00:39:23,541 --> 00:39:24,564
Never mind.

704
00:39:31,552 --> 00:39:34,725
In the future, i hope that your
love life is a little more peaceful,

705
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:35,942
But if it's not

706
00:39:36,067 --> 00:39:38,352
and an ex-lover turns up dead again,

707
00:39:39,353 --> 00:39:41,006
do me a favor?
Don't call me.

708
00:39:41,487 --> 00:39:43,563
I think we're pretty much even.

709
00:39:44,433 --> 00:39:46,179
- Paid in full.
- Great.

710
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,086
What are you gonna do now?

711
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:52,512
I'm ruined as a scientist,

712
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:56,893
so i'll probably go back to
helping people one by one.

713
00:39:57,299 --> 00:40:00,188
I think that's a great idea.
You're very good at that.

714
00:40:01,472 --> 00:40:02,304
Thanks.

715
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:16,455
Bye, sophie. Be well.

716
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:30,114
Jane kissed a girl.

717
00:40:31,389 --> 00:40:33,346
Well, you know, it's...

718
00:40:33,781 --> 00:40:35,182
Yeah, on the cheek.

719
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:36,641
Still counts.

720
00:40:38,208 --> 00:40:41,188
- Counts as what?
- Nothing. Just saying.

721
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,790
You want to drive?

722
00:41:01,644 --> 00:41:03,376
That's a very sweet offer.

723
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:05,629
Do i really seem so sad?

724
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:06,702
What?

725
00:41:06,993 --> 00:41:09,075
I was just asking
if you wanted to drive.

726
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,096
You don't like it when
i drive. You despise it.

727
00:41:11,221 --> 00:41:12,380
You drive way too fast.

728
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:14,263
I drive just fast enough.

729
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,424
You hate not being
the one in control,

730
00:41:16,549 --> 00:41:20,155
And yet you're willing to overcome
your irrational fears to cheer me up.

731
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,021
That's a beautiful thing, lisbon.
Thank you. I'd love to drive.

732
00:41:23,444 --> 00:41:24,356
Never mind.
