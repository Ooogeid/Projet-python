1
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,700
We've got Claire Wolcott... female, Caucasian, 32 years old.

2
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,700
She was found shot to death in her room.

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,500
Her husband's got friends at the Governor's office,

4
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,500
so he called in some favors.

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
He wants the investigation to be kept discreet and low-key.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,700
His wife gets murdered and his priority is discretion?

7
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,300
Oh. Okay.

8
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:05,500
Yep, Mrs. Wolcott was cheating on Mr. Wolcott...

9
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,600
Which makes Mr. Wolcott suspect number one.

10
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,500
Number two. Number one would be Mrs. Wolcott's mystery lover.

11
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,300
The room was registered

12
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,600
in Claire Wolcott's name, so no help there.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,600
At 2:24 a.m., hotel staff and guests heard three gunshots,

14
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,300
but they didn't know where they were coming from.

15
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,600
15, 20 minutes later, they come here and call 911.

16
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,100
Whoa. Found a shell.

17
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,400
- Looks like a 9-millimeter.  - And another.

18
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,500
Mark 'em for forensics.

19
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,600
- So the lover didn't do it.  - Because?

20
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,800
The, uh, shell casing things

21
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:44,300
indicate the shooter was across the room here.

22
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,600
He or she stepped in from outside

23
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,100
and started blasting away.

24
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,900
If the lover had done it, he'd have been closer to the victim,

25
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,900
and he wouldn't have had to shoot as many times.

26
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,300
And look. Circular,

27
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,200
which means a vertical drip

28
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,500
from someone standing right here, bleeding. Right?

29
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,000
Not spatter from the victim.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,200
You're a forensics expert now?

31
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,500
So Claire and mystery lover are asleep.

32
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,400
Someone comes in through the open door,

33
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,000
shoots them, leaves. Poor lover is woken by a bullet,

34
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,700
Claire dead next to him. "Aah!" Freaks out.

35
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,000
But nobody comes right away.

36
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,300
Mystery lover, who is only slightly wounded,

37
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,100
gets to thinking maybe the best thing to do is just...

38
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,600
slip away, out here.

39
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,300
You two finish up here.

40
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,400
Yes, boss.

41
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,500
Here.

42
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,600
There you go.

43
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,900
Clean one.

44
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,500
Anything else?

45
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,100
No.

46
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,500
"Doc lady."

47
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,600
The silver caddy arrived last night at 2:31.

48
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,700
Ah. That's about seven and a half minutes

49
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,800
- after the shooting took place.  - Name and room number?

50
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,700
Open it.

51
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,900
Psst.

52
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:29,200
- Hey. Wake up.  - Oh, my god. Who are you?

53
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,000
It's all right, ma'am. We're CBI.

54
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,200
- We need to talk to you, sir.  - What's this about?

55
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,300
- Take a wild guess.  - Put your hands in the air.

56
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:42,300
Okay. I'm, uh, I'm not under arrest, am I?

57
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,600
'Cause I've done nothing wrong.

58
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,000
Pants on. We'll talk after.

59
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,300
This is Kevin Haightly, resort manager.

60
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,900
Hi. Um, I know we can't expect to get the room back,

61
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,200
but when might the walkway be open for use, do you think?

62
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,400
That depends on when forensics is done. We'll let you know.

63
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,700
Okay. Thanks.

64
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,000
It was a cold night, so we lit a fire and made love.

65
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,100
We went to sleep afterwards, and suddenly there was,

66
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,800
like, a sharp pain and bang! I wake up,

67
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,900
and there's blood everywhere and I'm shot in the arm

68
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,600
and Claire's dead. You know, I freaked.

69
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,400
- You didn't see who did it?  - No.

70
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,400
Why'd you leave?

71
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,100
Claire was dead. I couldn't help her,

72
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,900
and I couldn't help you guys. I didn't see anything, so...

73
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,900
You know, what could I contribute?

74
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,000
She's a married woman.

75
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,100
Yeah, we know that. And Jill Rubenstein...

76
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,250
- what's your connection with her?  - The doctor lady?

77
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,250
I met her in the parking lot and asked her for help.

78
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,500
A complete stranger takes you to her room,

79
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,900
treats your wound and then has sexual intercourse with you?

80
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,900
What can I say? The hippocratic oath is a beautiful thing.

81
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,900
How well did you know Claire Wolcott?

82
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,900
Uh, I don't really know her that well.

83
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,100
I met her just a few weeks ago.

84
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,000
She was at a bar, and I picked her up.

85
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,200
- Since then, I've seen her occasionally for sex.  - Is that what happened last night?

86
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,700
Yeah. I called and asked her to meet me for a drink.

87
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,100
We came here.

88
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,200
- Did anybody else know you were here?  - Nobody. Just me and Claire.

89
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,400
And how long had you been in the room?

90
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,900
Um, a few hours.

91
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,100
I'd agreed to, uh, you know, stay the night.

92
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,100
I was fond of Claire,

93
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,700
and it's a long drive home, so I stayed.

94
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:36,200
- I don't normally do that.  - No? What... what's your normal procedure?

95
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,800
After lovemaking? Depends on the type of woman.

96
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,900
- So you've got it down to a science.  - I'm good at what I do.

97
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,800
Okay, Mr. Fricke, and what is it that you do?

98
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,900
I'm a pickup artist.

99
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,800
Mm.

100
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,200
A, uh, woman whisperer, if you will.

101
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,900
A pickup artist... that's your profession?

102
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,700
You sound like my mom.

103
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,900
Um, it's more of a total lifestyle kind of thing.

104
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,600
You know? I-I practice my art, of course. That's my passion.

105
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,300
But I teach and I blog also,

106
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,600
um, conduct seminars, workshops, that sort of thing.

107
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,900
- Is that good money?  - Not bad.

108
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,800
- And do you take money from the women you pick up?  - Sometimes, when I need to.

109
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,500
Did you take money from Claire Wolcott?

110
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,000
No. No. Like I say, I was fond of Claire.

111
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,100
Um, I planned to see her again.

112
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,000
You really only want to monetize as an exit strategy.

113
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,600
Paul, is your mother still alive?

114
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,200
I know where you're going with this, Dr. Freud,

115
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,100
And, uh, you're wrong.

116
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,200
My mom's dead, as it goes,

117
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,100
but, uh, I loved her dearly, and she loved me.

118
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,000
Who said anything about your mother?

119
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,500
- You just did.  - No, I didn't.

120
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,600
- Yes, you did.  - Didn't.

121
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,800
- What are you talking about?  - I'm just kidding. Just playing with you, Paul.

122
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,300
Just kidding, mucking around.

123
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,500
Yeah. Are we done here?

124
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,400
Do you know who killed Claire?

125
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,100
No.

126
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,800
Interesting.

127
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,100
He's either a habitual liar telling the truth

128
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,200
or he's an honest man lying.

129
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,300
Do you keep a list of your pickups?

130
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,800
Yeah, of course. I, uh, I have 'em here.

131
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,000
Names, numbers and a 1 to 10 grading system.

132
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,400
Nice. Something to show your grandkids.

133
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,400
We're gonna need you to forward a copy of that list to us.

134
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,900
Oh. Yeah, sure.

135
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,300
What, you think maybe this was a jealous ex-lover?

136
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,300
Could be.

137
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,500
Wow.

138
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,000
I say we bring him in anyway, for creepiness.

139
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,700
Which should be a criminal offense, but isn't.

140
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,700
He could have shot her, then shot himself to cover it up.

141
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,900
- He simply could have shot her and left.  - He didn't have the gun on him,

142
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:46,300
- local P.D. has searched every inch of this place and found nothing. He's clean.  - Maybe someone's trying to kill him, not her.

143
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,300
Not likely. The room was registered

144
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,900
- in Claire Wolcott's name.  No one else knew he was there.  - What was she thinking?

145
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,200
She was so beautiful, and he's so... creepy.

146
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,000
Yeah, that Dr. Rubenstein was hot, too. How does he do it?

147
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,500
All you need is a basic understanding

148
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,500
of the evolutionary psychology of women,

149
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,600
rigorously and fearlessly applied.

150
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,100
You gotta know what buttons to press.

151
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,500
- Like we're toasters?  - Like men don't have buttons, too?

152
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,800
Men are like toasters.

153
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,900
Women... a little more like, uh, accordions.

154
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,300
I thought that was a compliment.

155
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,600
Mr. Wolcott?

156
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,100
Thank you for coming. I'm so sorry for your loss.

157
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,100
The effects you requested...

158
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,000
photos, video of Claire.

159
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,500
We'll return this to you as soon as possible.

160
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,100
I was just upstairs

161
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,100
speaking with my friend the Attorney General,

162
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,600
And I told him that I will not rest

163
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,300
Until the man who did this is brought to justice.

164
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,000
I will not rest.

165
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,200
- I know I can expect the same from you and your people.  - I assure you

166
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,800
This unit does the best we can  with every case we run. Cho?

167
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,300
If it's convenient,

168
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,800
Agent Cho would like  to ask you a few questions.

169
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,500
Hi.

170
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,600
When did you speak to your wife last?

171
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
I was in San Francisco on a business dinner.

172
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
I called Claire around midday,

173
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,200
Told her I'll probably be staying in town that night.

174
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,400
- Did you? Stay the night in town?  - I did.

175
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,900
Did she say where she was going or who she was meeting?

176
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,800
- No, but I didn't ask.  - So you didn't know she was at the spa?

177
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,300
I wouldn't expect to know.

178
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,100
- She often went up there on a whim.  - Can you think of anyone who want to hurt her?

179
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:32,600
No. No, she was, um...   Harmless.

180
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,600
- Any friends or family that might be in any trouble?  - She's from back east.

181
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,100
She doesn't have any family or friends out here.

182
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,400
She shopped and she played tennis and she went to the spas.

183
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,300
No one would have any motives...

184
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,500
Yes?

185
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,900
I recall she fired an assistant last month.

186
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,800
Caught her stealing jewelry.

187
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,300
- I believe she was pressing charges.  - Name?

188
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:59,400
Natalie... Something. My people will have her details.

189
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,800
Are you aware that on the night of her murder,

190
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,800
Your wife was meeting a lover?

191
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,000
Yes.

192
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,400
The local authorities told me they suspected as much.

193
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,800
Did you know she had a lover? Prior to her death, I mean?

194
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:19,400
- No. Do you have a name? is he a suspect?  - We have a name. He is not the suspect.

195
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,800
- Who is he?  - I'm not at liberty to say.

196
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,900
- I want his name.  - You can't have it.

197
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,100
Are you sure, Agent Cho?

198
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,100
Because I can make one phone call,

199
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,200
- And your career is toast.  - That's impressive.

200
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,200
The best I can get with one call is a pizza.

201
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,200
Now this business dinner you were at in San Francisco,

202
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,200
What's the timing on that, and who else was there?

203
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,700
My people can give you times, names and numbers.

204
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,800
We're done here.

205
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,700
Thanks for your cooperation.

206
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,500
Wolcott's wife was so pretty.

207
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,200
What do you see?

208
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,500
Nice shoes, loneliness.

209
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,700
Where we going?

210
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,000
Natalie Edreau?

211
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,800
Yes?

212
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,300
- We're with the CBI. Can we come in?  - Look, I already told the cops

213
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,500
- I didn't steal anything from that bitch.   - By "bitch," are you referring Claire Wolcott?

214
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,200
- Yeah. So?  - Uh...

215
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,300
She was murdered last night.

216
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,000
How long did you work for Claire Wolcott?

217
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,700
About a year... Till she turned psycho.

218
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,100
She claimed that you stole jewelry from her.

219
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,000
Yeah. She was wrong. I didn't steal anything.

220
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,200
Claire pressed charges against you.

221
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,700
- How'd that make you feel?  - Excuse me, are you trying to say that I killed her?

222
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,100
- Do you own a gun, Natalie?  - Oh, my god. This is really stupid.

223
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:11,400
- Um, no, I don't own a gun.  And, no, I didn't kill Claire.  - Where were you last night?

224
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,900
I was hanging out with my roommate till about 9:00 or so.

225
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,800
Then, uh, then I went out for dinner.

226
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,500
What'd you have? For dinner?

227
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,500
What does that have to do with anything?

228
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,900
The chopped salad at pastucci's.

229
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,800
Ah. Yes.

230
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,400
There's something on this side of the room

231
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,600
- You don't want us to find. What is that?  - Nothing. There's nothing.

232
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,200
Look me in the eye and say that.

233
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,300
Whatever. Search all you want.

234
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,200
Meh. Too much stuff. You're not very tidy.

235
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,900
Good in bed I expect, yeah?

236
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,900
Messy women make good lovers.

237
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,000
- Can I hold your hand?  - I...

238
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,500
Shush.

239
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,700
Hmm...

240
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,500
Camera.

241
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
- Okay, those are personal, so...   - ooh.

242
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,300
- Uh-huh.  - Is it...

243
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:38,900
Claire Wolcott and her lover Paul Fricke...

244
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:43,200
Time-stamped two hours before the murder.

245
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,500
These are the photos we pulled from your digital camera.

246
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,900
A couple hours after these were taken, Claire Wolcott was dead.

247
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,800
That doesn't prove anything.

248
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,000
Opportunity and motive. You were close by when she died.

249
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,800
And the theft charge she laid on you dies with her.

250
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,700
That was a garbage charge.

251
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,400
- I wasn't worried about that.  - No?

252
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,600
No.

253
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,000
You didn't steal jewelry from her?

254
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,200
Please. She dressed like a mormon call girl.

255
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,600
- I wouldn't want her jewelry if you paid me.  - I didn't ask if you want her jewelry.

256
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,900
- I asked if you stole it.  - No, I didn't.

257
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,200
Why were you photographing her?

258
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,700
Now think this through, Natalie. We're investigating murder.

259
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,400
If you have an explanation for these

260
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,200
That doesn't involve killing her,

261
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,000
- You should tell us, get yourself off the hook.  - I thought

262
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
If I threatened to tell her husband about the affair,

263
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,200
Then she would drop the theft charges.

264
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,200
- That's what the pictures are for.  - How do you know she is having affair?

265
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,600
It was obvious. She kept sending me out to buy men's gifts.

266
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,900
You know, like, watches and ties.

267
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,100
I knew it wasn't for her husband. I'm not an idiot.

268
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,600
- What did Claire say when you confronted her about it?  - I didn't confront her about it.

269
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,400
She left with that flugly guy before I got the chance.

270
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,800
- Probably wouldn't have worked anyway.  - Why not?

271
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,600
Because keith Wolcott is, like, super controlling,

272
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,500
Especially about money.

273
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,500
He probably knew all along his wife was sleeping around.

274
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,600
- What's the verdict?  - I'm not liking her for this.

275
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,600
But we should talk to the roommate,

276
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,600
Make sure her alibi stands up.

277
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,100
The husband, on the other hand...

278
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,800
- He is the type to know about his wife's affairs.  - His business dinner at San Francisco

279
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,600
- Couldn't have made it back to calistoga to kill her.  - He's also the type

280
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,600
- That'll hire other people to do his dirty work.  - Yes. He is.

281
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,000
- And they don't take credit cards.  - I'll look into his finances.

282
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,300
- Boring.  - Okay, Mr. Entertainment. What do you want to do?

283
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,300
I wanna go back to the crime scene.

284
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,300
That hotel room... there is something that just isn't right.

285
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,700
Hey.

286
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,200
You're up.

287
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,700
Great.

288
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,500
Something's not quite right.

289
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,700
Don't take too long. I'm hungry.

290
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,700
Let's go eat.

291
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,600
Good to see you again. So... Is there any news?

292
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,600
The owner keeps asking me

293
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,900
When we'll be able to reopen the villa.

294
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,200
- No news.  - We're here for lunch.

295
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,900
Oh. Absolutely. Um...

296
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,200
One moment.

297
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,200
Oh, look who's here.

298
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,900
Ah, just the man.

299
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,400
I have a question I need to ask him.

300
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,200
Right this way.

301
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,000
- Oh. Thank you.  - Thank you.

302
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,300
Katie?

303
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,800
Table four needs fresh drinks, okay?

304
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,300
Yes, sir.

305
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,000
Hey!

306
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,900
My old friends from the CBI. Come, have a seat.

307
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,200
Surprised to see you back here so soon.

308
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,600
It's my number one hunting ground,

309
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,600
Loaded with my kind of women...

310
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,100
Beautiful, rich, married and unhappy.

311
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,900
So you specialize?

312
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,600
Sure. Yeah.

313
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,000
Some guys will tell ya hot, young singles are the real test.

314
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,600
But I'm not in this to win a points contest, you know?

315
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,000
Plus, I like the gratitude you get from the older ladies.

316
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
A woman died... a woman that you were close to.

317
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,300
- Doesn't that give you pause?  - Sure it does. Yeah, I have feelings.

318
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,500
But having this gunshot wound?

319
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,500
- Genius opener.  - An opener?

320
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,400
You know, a prop or a line you use to start a conversation.

321
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,100
- You can't just go up and say, "hey, what's your name?"  - No?

322
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,000
Duh.

323
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,800
So how do you do it exactly? You know, pick up women.

324
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,500
- Need some help, huh?  - No.

325
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,500
Big handsome dude like you? I got a few basic techniques...

326
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,100
... that will turn you into a freakin' sex machine.

327
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,400
A machine.

328
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,100
Well, I'm not looking to be a machine so much.

329
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,100
- I'm more of a steady relationship kind of guy.  - When you're scoring...

330
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,500
... with a different super fox every night,

331
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,500
what do you want a relationship for?

332
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,500
Do you ever fall in love...

333
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,400
- ... with any of these different super foxes you score with?  - No. Never.

334
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,700
Love is for guys who can't get laid.

335
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,100
Oh.

336
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,000
So, uh, what's your basic technique?

337
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,600
Oh, there's a thousand ways to seduce a woman.

338
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,100
All kinds of workable systems.

339
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,500
But they all boil down to three words...

340
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,200
... "contempt", "control", "excitement".

341
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,700
Contempt, control, e... excitement?

342
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,100
Women want men that don't need or want them.

343
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,900
They want to be told what to do,

344
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,400
... and they want edge, adventure, drama.

345
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,800
Whatever you wanna call it.

346
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,200
Present that package to them, and they will bite.

347
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,600
Guaranteed.

348
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,600
Ouch.

349
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,100
And then when you have one under your spell,

350
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,600
... then you get up and leave.

351
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,000
L... leave? But...

352
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,300
No, no, no, no. You leave. Trust me.

353
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,500
Next time she sees you, she'll tear your clothes off.

354
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,800
Guaranteed.

355
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,400
- What's going on with you two?  - Excuse me?

356
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,600
You and Katie here. You got something going on?

357
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,200
- No.  - No.

358
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,400
Just askin'.

359
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:02,400
I used to let her sleep with me once in a while. That's all.

360
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,200
No, you had feelings for her.

361
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,600
Years ago, maybe a little. Sure.

362
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,400
- You know, before I got my mojo working.  - Hmm.

363
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,700
Thanks for talking to us, Paul.

364
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,400
Oh, you had one more question...

365
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,700
- ... you wanted to ask.  - Ah, yes, that's right. Thank you. I forgot.

366
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,200
Uh, the night that you were sleeping with Claire,

367
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,600
... was the patio door open or closed?

368
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,900
Uh... Closed, I think.

369
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,000
Thank you.

370
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,200
OK, now I'm really hungry.

371
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,600
- Drive-thru.  - Done.

372
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,400
You think Fricke's right?

373
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,400
Was the door closed? Yes.

374
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,400
It was a cold night. They lit a fire.

375
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,400
Why would they leave the door open?

376
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,400
- No, I mean, is he right about how to deal with women?  - 100% wrong.

377
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,400
Unless, of course, you wanna have a lot of casual sex...

378
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,500
... with total strangers. Then he's right.

379
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,300
When did you first meet Paul Fricke?

380
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,800
At a wine tasting event a friend was throwing.

381
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,900
- And how long were you and he romantically involved?  - Um...

382
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,600
Three, maybe four hours.

383
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,400
So you didn't know Paul Fricke...

384
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,100
- ... prior to agreeing to spend the night with him?  - No.

385
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,800
And you haven't spoken to him since?

386
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,000
What attracted you to him in the first place?

387
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Four times?

388
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,500
What exactly attracted you to Paul Fricke in the first place?

389
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,800
I don't know. I guess there was just something about him.

390
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,900
And were you at all hurt or angry...

391
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,900
... when the relationship ended?

392
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,800
Mm... no. I was disappointed more than anything.

393
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,600
We had a wonderful time together.

394
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,000
Thank you for your time.

395
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,600
- Oh, you'll, um, you'll tell him "hello" for me, won't you?  - Yes.

396
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,600
Hey, how's it going? Any potential suspects?

397
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,100
Nope. I'm bringing in the rest tomorrow.

398
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,600
There's more?

399
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,600
This is just "A" through "M." How's it going with you?

400
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,100
No unusual transactions for Mr. Wolcott.

401
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,100
But three days before she was killed,

402
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,100
... Claire Wolcott made a $200,000 withdrawal...

403
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,100
... in the form of a cashier's check,

404
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,300
... made out to none other than Paul Fricke.

405
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,300
Here's the best part... according to the bank,

406
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,400
Keith Wolcott set up the account, so he'd be notified...

407
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,400
... whenever a large transaction took place.

408
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,400
Meaning that Wolcott had to have known about the 200 grand.

409
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,700
Exactly.

410
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,200
- Nice work.  - Thanks.

411
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,000
Uh... Brandy?

412
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Come on.

413
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,300
"Darn it, woman!" said the redneck.

414
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,600
"Ain't you never seen a goat before?"

415
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,300
- He's handling his grief well.  - Mm.

416
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,800
Excuse me, Mr. Wolcott?

417
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,500
Now's not a good time.

418
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,100
I'm sorry to intrude.

419
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,200
We need to ask you some follow-up questions...

420
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,900
- ... regarding your previous statement.  - I'll be happy to speak with you tomorrow morning in my office.

421
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:02,800
- Oh, this won't take long.  - I told you... tomorrow morning, my office.

422
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,400
Very good.

423
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,600
Mr. Wolcott, it's about your wife's lover.

424
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,300
We, uh, know about the $200,000 she gave him,

425
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,300
And we know that you know about it.

426
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,200
How dare you.

427
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,700
How dare I? Did I do something daring?

428
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:25,000
Am I supposed to be afraid of you?

429
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,800
You're supposed to be respectful.

430
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,100
Respectful? You contemptible little buffoon.

431
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,800
Your wife just died,

432
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,200
... and you're swanning around in a monkey suit...

433
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,200
... drinking punch and laughing with your idiot friends...

434
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,600
And you want respect?

435
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,400
There's your respect.

436
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,000
What?

437
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
You know damn well what. You assaulted a man.

438
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,500
- Oh, I just tweaked him on the nose.  - Technically, that's assault.

439
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,000
Technically, he's an ass. He deserved it.

440
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,400
Yes, he is, but this is not a school yard.

441
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,800
You simply cannot do stuff like that.

442
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,800
I did. I did it.

443
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,500
And the seas didn't boil and the sky didn't fall.

444
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,800
They will shortly.

445
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,000
Wolcott is on his way down here with a $1,000-an-hour lawyer.

446
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,300
If you give him a formal apology,

447
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,800
... he says he's willing to drop the whole matter.

448
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,700
Hmm, let me think... No.

449
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,200
Would you please be reasonable for once?

450
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,500
- I'm busy.  - Right.

451
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,500
I am. I'm just thinking that, uh...

452
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,000
He's gonna drop the whole matter in any case.

453
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,600
- Oh, really?  - I guarantee it.

454
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,000
He's a shallow narcissist. It's all about image.

455
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,100
And this whole business makes him seem small and silly.

456
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,300
Ooh!

457
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,400
Contempt, control, excitement.

458
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,000
What?

459
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,700
Nothing.

460
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,100
This place is so nice.

461
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,100
$800 a night, minimum. Can you believe that?

462
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,900
Huh.

463
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,800
Hello? What, you're not talking to me now?

464
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,300
You barely said a word the whole time.

465
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,800
I'll talk to you when you have something interesting to say.

466
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,500
Fine. Be a jerk.

467
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:13,000
I'd go in. But I'd have to keep my injury dry.

468
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,200
Gunshot wound.

469
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,700
- Oh.  - Don't worry. Uh, you're not in any danger.

470
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,900
I'm a lover, not a fighter.

471
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,700
Oh, not you guys again.

472
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,600
The old magic not working so good today, huh?

473
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,100
Just like baseball.

474
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,200
Most of the time, even in major leagues,

475
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,900
You, uh, swing and you miss. Gotta keep on swinging.

476
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,500
I hit on ten women a day.

477
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,300
I'm going to have sexual intercourse...

478
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,100
- ... with at least one of them.  - That is gross.

479
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,500
She's intrigued by me, this one.

480
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,100
She's just too proud to admit it.

481
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,200
Yeah, get your shoes on, Romeo.

482
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,200
Hey.

483
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,200
Focus on the shoes.

484
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,900
You know, I didn't notice before.

485
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,100
You're not bad lookin'.

486
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,700
Shoulders are a bit too wide,

487
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,700
but, uh, otherwise, pretty nice.

488
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,800
You're kidding, right? You're trying to hit on me?

489
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,600
What man in his right mind wouldn't want to hit on you?

490
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,100
Okay, leave her alone.

491
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,800
Get in the car.

492
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,600
I'm sorry.

493
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,600
My colleague, Agent Jane, refuses to apologize.

494
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,700
He says he's happy to see you in court.

495
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,100
And you refuse to talk to us,

496
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,700
so I can't rule you out as a suspect.

497
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,100
- I'm afraid this is gonna make a bit of a mess.  - Keith, I suggest...

498
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,000
No, no. I have nothing to hide.

499
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,100
What do you wanna know?

500
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,500
What do you know about your wife's affair with Paul Fricke?

501
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,400
I knew Claire was having an affair

502
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,000
with this Fricke person, and I knew about the money

503
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,500
- she was gonna give him.  - Then why did you deny it?

504
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:50,300
It's not the sort of thing one likes to admit, now, is it?

505
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,400
And I knew it would make me a suspect,

506
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,500
- and that would be tedious.  - Did you confront her about Fricke?

507
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:59,000
No. I stopped the check immediately, of course.

508
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,800
And that was the end of it? You weren't angry?

509
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,800
Not at all. I was happy.

510
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,200
I wanted to divorce her for ages.

511
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,100
Why?

512
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,500
She'd become irritating.

513
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,500
The cost of divorce always deterred me,

514
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,600
but her infidelity with Fricke

515
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,100
cut the payout she'd receive in half.

516
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,100
Now if Claire had lived, come Monday,

517
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,400
She'd be in for a nasty surprise.

518
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,900
I was all set to serve her with divorce papers.

519
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,400
Even cuckolded, she stood to get a big sum.

520
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,400
Rich man like yourself...

521
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,700
her death saved you a lot of money, didn't it?

522
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,000
Yes, it did.

523
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,700
But money isn't everything, is it?

524
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,800
I'm sorry she's dead... truly sorry.

525
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:47,000
But every cloud... as they say.

526
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,200
Well, I believe we're done here.

527
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,800
Seems so.

528
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,300
You'll be hearing from the attorney general shortly

529
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,100
regarding Mr. Jane's conduct.

530
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,700
Oh, I doubt it.

531
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,300
Really?

532
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,900
When you've thought about it,

533
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,600
you'll see that this business makes you seem small and silly,

534
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,600
and you'll drop the whole matter.

535
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,300
You misled us, Paul.

536
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:20,100
You were going to take money from Claire.

537
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,400
But I didn't, did I?

538
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,100
A business associate of mine

539
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,300
is opening up a new club here in town.

540
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,700
He, uh, offered me a role as partial owner

541
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,700
if I could come up with a share of the building costs.

542
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,900
- Claire was generous enough to offer me a loan.  - And?

543
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,600
I went to deposit it just a couple days ago

544
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,900
- and was told that the check had been stopped.  - That must have been disappointing.

545
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,300
- What did Claire say?  - She said it must be a mistake,

546
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,600
- and she'd take care of it Monday.  - Did you believe her?

547
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,300
Doesn't really matter.

548
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:51,300
- You know what the best part about being me is?  - No, I don't.

549
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:54,800
There are literally dozens of rich, needy women out there

550
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,200
that, uh, I could go to for financial help.

551
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,000
I didn't need Claire's money.

552
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,500
Hey.

553
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,100
Uh, what's the story with Katie the waitress?

554
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,200
I'm in the middle of something.

555
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,600
Oh. I'm sorry. I was just thinking.

556
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,200
I had a thought. Bear with me?

557
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,600
So Katie... tell me.

558
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,300
Nothing to tell.

559
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:20,700
Used to be if I, uh, didn't score for whatever reason,

560
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,600
I'd, uh, call her off the bench.

561
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,200
Can't sleep alone, huh?

562
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,200
Some people use cocoa and a good book.

563
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,100
I use beautiful women.

564
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,300
She must have been crazy about you

565
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,700
To put up with a deal like that, huh?

566
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,700
I guess so.

567
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,200
Difficult for her now to watch you pick up

568
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,100
a different beautiful woman every night.

569
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,200
- That's not how it is with me and Katie.  - Well, sure, it is.

570
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,400
She loves you. That much is clear.

571
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,400
Maybe that's what this is all about.

572
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,100
Your behavior got too much for her.

573
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:57,200
Katie has absolutely nothing to do with this.

574
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,200
How can you be so sure?

575
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,600
I know Katie. She's a good person.

576
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,600
She would never hurt anyone.

577
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,100
Okay, great.

578
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,200
Thanks. You can go.

579
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,100
- No.  - Ah, sorry. I'm sorry.

580
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,700
When agent Cho says you can go, you can go. Not a moment sooner.

581
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,700
Just give me one second.

582
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,000
Hey, you can't dismiss my subjects like that.

583
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Oh, I know, and I took it back.

584
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Besides, we need him back out there in the saddle.

585
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,500
You will agree with me 100% when I explain my theory,

586
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,100
my little plan.

587
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,400
Do you have any good clothes?

588
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,900
I'm wearing them.

589
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:44,800
Uh, do you have anything with a little more, uh...

590
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,900
zing?

591
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,100
No.

592
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,100
Okay.

593
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,700
Well...

594
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,700
I'm gonna have to take you shopping,

595
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:56,000
Just you and me.

596
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I'll wait for you.

597
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,100
Right here.

598
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,100
I'm in position.

599
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:36,000
- Okay, look around for a likely target.  - Will do. Hey...

600
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,500
Bourbon on the rocks. Make it a double.

601
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,000
- Those two will do, I guess.  - Good.

602
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Okay, now listen up.

603
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,500
Relax. I'm gonna talk you right through this.

604
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:56,200
Keep it smooth. You have to be calm and confident.

605
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,100
Yeah, you told me that already. I have the general idea.

606
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:02,700
Hello, ladies, I'll be right with you.

607
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:07,300
Start a tab for me, would you? Room 206. That's for you.

608
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:10,100
Hi. My name's Kimball. What are your names? You first.

609
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,200
- Darby...  - Darby.

610
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,600
- Sarabeth.  - Hey, Sarabeth. Tell me about yourselves.

611
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,400
Um...

612
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,500
What do you wanna know?

613
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:23,800
- Well, it's not exactly textbook, but he's figuring it out.  - That worked? "hello, ladies"?

614
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,400
- He's kicking it old-school.  - There's Fricke.

615
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,900
- Where?  - Let me see.

616
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:32,100
Cho, look, with the two blondes.

617
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,500
I don't believe this guy.

618
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,700
I give up. I do not understand women.

619
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,700
Never have, never will.

620
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,200
Seems like the dumber you treat them,

621
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,800
- the better they like it.  - They're Drunk Women.

622
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,200
- You can't generalize all women in general.  - This is your fault.

623
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,000
No, it's not. I'm just sitting here.

624
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:05,000
Katie? You've worked a double today.

625
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,100
- Why don't you clock out and have a drink on the house?  - Thanks, Mr.H. That'd be good.

626
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,100
Sure.

627
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,600
Here we go.

628
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,300
This is where we bring it.

629
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:22,700
- Time for phase two.  - Roger that. Phase two coming up.

630
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,400
What's phase two?

631
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,200
Let's go, Sarabeth.

632
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,500
What did he say?

633
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,000
- What did he say?  - I didn't hear.

634
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,900
Uh, he said, uh...

635
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,400
You don't wanna know.

636
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,900
Oh, well.

637
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,400
Struck out, huh?

638
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,200
I blew it, as usual.

639
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,000
I'm just unlucky in love. Always have been.

640
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,100
I know how that goes.

641
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,700
Same story, huh?

642
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,800
Same story.

643
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,000
That guy?

644
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,500
Him.

645
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,500
You know, no offense, but i've been watching him

646
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,700
Operate this evening, and he seems like kind of a creep.

647
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,000
A player, no doubt, but a creep.

648
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,900
This isn't who he is.

649
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,400
When we were together,

650
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,200
He was a sweet, caring, generous man.

651
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,200
It was me that screwed it up.

652
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,200
And we had this terrible fight,

653
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,900
And I said some mean things.

654
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,800
Mean things.

655
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,300
All this is an attempt to prove me wrong, I guess.

656
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,500
If I had a woman like you in love with me,

657
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,600
You could say whatever you like. I wouldn't be running around.

658
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:58,700
- That's nice of you to say. Thank you.  - You know what we need to do?

659
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:02,500
You need to make him jealous. Let him see you out and about,

660
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,600
- Enjoying yourself with another man.  - Are you hitting on me?

661
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,800
Yes, I am.

662
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,200
It's a good plan, isn't it?

663
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,300
The kid's a natural. Look at him. Look at him go.

664
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:16,400
The Cho. No business like Cho business.

665
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,700
206.

666
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,800
Here's the plan. Let's walk right past him,

667
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,800
Laughing and smiling like we're on our way somewhere cool.

668
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,000
- Get him thinking.  - And then what?

669
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,100
I'll think of something.

670
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,600
All right. Let's do it.

671
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,000
After you.

672
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Okay, we're in the room.

673
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,500
Hey, Cho, that's some nice work.

674
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,500
Very nice work. So just sit tight.

675
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,700
- I don't think it's gonna take long.  - You hope.

676
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,400
Who are you talking to?

677
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:22,300
My colleagues.

678
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,300
Okay. Who are they?

679
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,790
I'm a state agent, Ma'am.

680
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:29,400
We're conducting an undercover operation

681
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,400
Regarding the wolcott murder case.

682
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,100
I... I don't understand.

683
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,300
I apologize for the deception.

684
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,200
You mean... You're not... You don't...

685
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,700
No, Ma'am.

686
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,700
Oh.

687
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,200
I'm so embarrassed.

688
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,900
That's understandable.

689
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,500
I...

690
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:56,300
Nothing is happening.

691
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,900
You have to have patience, woman.

692
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,100
She just doesn't have any patience.

693
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:04,600
I'm not touching that one.

694
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,100
There.

695
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,000
Come on.

696
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,200
- Drop the weapon.  - Drop it, Haightly.

697
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,300
Hands behind your back. Let's go.

698
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,000
Hi.

699
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,100
You set me up.

700
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,800
Yes, we did.

701
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,200
How did you know it was me?

702
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,490
Ah. It was a cold night.

703
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,500
Fricke told us that the patio door in his room

704
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,700
was closed when he went to sleep,

705
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,400
and I checked. You can't open them from the outside,

706
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,700
which means that the killer must have entered

707
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:20,300
by the main door, which requires a key.

708
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:23,000
Who has the keys? Staff.

709
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,400
Who on the staff would wanna hurt Claire Wolcott?

710
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,300
I don't know. Nobody.

711
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,500
Who would wanna hurt Paul Fricke?

712
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,500
Maybe you.

713
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,400
But what reason would you have for hating Paul Fricke?

714
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,200
Let me guess. Uh, something to do with a woman?

715
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,000
Katie?

716
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:48,200
You hated him because he used and abused her...

717
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,100
The woman you loved.

718
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:53,300
I'm not sorry. He's dirt.

719
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:56,400
The way he carried on with those other women...

720
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,400
Rubbing Katie's nose in it.

721
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:01,400
I never would hurt her like he did.

722
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,900
I wish I had killed him.

723
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,300
But you killed Claire Wolcott instead.

724
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:10,000
I never meant to do that. I wanted to kill Fricke,

725
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,800
Not Claire. But she shouldn't have been doing what she

726
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:17,300
was doing, should she? I mean, it's not like anybody cares.

727
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:21,100
- Her husband was going...  - I care. I care about Claire Wolcott.

728
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,490
- She was a living person.  - That's enough.

729
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,500
No. You took her life.

730
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:29,900
I...I just... I think he should be sorry.

731
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,400
You're right.

732
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,300
Well, do you wanna say it?

733
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:44,300
I'm sorry.

734
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,000
Thank you.

735
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,400
- Where's Cho?  - I don't know.

736
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,900
Called him a couple times. No answer.

737
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:59,800
The problem is, I really love Paul.

738
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,800
I know how he seems, and I know how he's been,

739
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,400
but at the end of the day,

740
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,300
when I think of who I really wanna be with,

741
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,600
it's him.

742
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:13,900
That's crazy, huh?

743
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:17,000
Love is crazy, I guess.

744
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
No, it isn't.

745
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
You should seek psychiatric help.

746
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,100
Ugh.

747
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,400
You mind?

748
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,900
Not at all.

749
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,600
Rough night?

750
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,200
Ah, not bad. Couple good phone numbers.

751
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,200
Hmm.

752
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:05,500
Yep. Two very tasty numbers.

753
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:15,000
I wish you'd stop being so damn stupid.

754
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,500
You have a good woman over there that knows you

755
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,700
and still loves you.

756
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,800
Excuse me.

757
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,600
Oh.

758
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,100
You looked kinda lonely.

759
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:49,000
My friend and I were wondering if you'd like to join us.

760
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,300
Hi. Um... I'm sorry. I'm... I'm married.
