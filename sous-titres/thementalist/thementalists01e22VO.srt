1
00:00:28,767 --> 00:00:31,307
Excuse me.

2
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,300
What kind of tree is this?

3
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,100
Couldn't say.

4
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,300
Smells good.

5
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,000
So you're not a local?

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,500
Born 5 miles down the road.

7
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,234
Just don't give a crap about trees.

8
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,200
Thank you.

9
00:00:59,467 --> 00:01:01,833
Name's Justin Prentiss.

10
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:03,800
Student at a private school operation

11
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,733
A couple miles from here.

12
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:08,133
They realized he was missing around 6:00 this morning,

13
00:01:08,133 --> 00:01:10,167
Activated the electronic monitoring device

14
00:01:10,167 --> 00:01:12,666
On his ankle, found him and called us at 8:00.

15
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:15,866
- Do they have an estimated time of death yet?  - Coroner puts time of  
death

16
00:01:15,866 --> 00:01:17,699
Somewhere between 10:00 and 1:00 last night.

17
00:01:17,699 --> 00:01:19,333
I wanted to take him down the mountain

18
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:22,200
Soon as forensics were done, but as per your request,

19
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,800
- We didn't touch him.  - Oh, we won't be here long.

20
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,000
- You can have him as soon as we're done.  - What's with the ankle  
bracelet?

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,800
Good question. Mr. Maclean?

22
00:01:35,533 --> 00:01:38,299
This is the principal of the school... Asher Maclean.

23
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:41,134
These people are from the CBI. They want to know why

24
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:44,767
your student has an electronic monitoring device on him.

25
00:01:44,767 --> 00:01:48,266
Justin had some truancy issues recently, hence the device.

26
00:01:48,266 --> 00:01:52,466
What kind of school is this, exactly? Bright Arch is a wilderness program  
for troubled youth.

27
00:01:52,466 --> 00:01:55,700
- Like a summer camp?  - No, we're an accredited high school.

28
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,100
Students stay at Bright Arch for a year, on average.

29
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,566
We provide structure and discipline

30
00:02:00,566 --> 00:02:02,900
Through close interaction with nature

31
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:06,500
Plus a regular high school curriculum, of course.

32
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,433
Uh, she doesn't like you, and you don't like her.

33
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:14,600
Why is that?

34
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,967
No comment.

35
00:02:16,967 --> 00:02:19,600
Chief Brody?

36
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,366
- Why don't you like him?  - What has that got to do with anything?

37
00:02:23,366 --> 00:02:26,266
- I'm just curious.  - Think you might show a little more respect.

38
00:02:26,266 --> 00:02:29,600
- Respect for...  - There is a dead child here.

39
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,399
Yes. Yes, he's dead.

40
00:02:31,399 --> 00:02:34,333
He doesn't care how I talk to you.

41
00:02:37,433 --> 00:02:39,000
I've never worked with the CBI before.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,233
- Do all your units come with a clown?  - We get the job done.

43
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:44,533
Well, how about getting it done now?

44
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:48,133
So we can take this kid out of here. How would that be?

45
00:02:48,133 --> 00:02:50,700
Yeah. We'll do that.

46
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,500
Yep, you can take him. We've got the basic facts.

47
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,166
- Oh, is that right? That quick, huh?  - Uh, yeah.

48
00:02:56,166 --> 00:03:00,567
- You want to enlighten us?  - Oh, forensics probably told you a lot of it  
already,

49
00:03:00,567 --> 00:03:02,667
I would guess.

50
00:03:02,667 --> 00:03:04,700
Uh, his knuckles and his knees sugest

51
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,500
that he was overpowered in a hand-to-hand struggle.

52
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,066
The blow to the head was the coup de grâce.

53
00:03:10,066 --> 00:03:14,667
But the ground around him is relatively undisturbed,

54
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:16,700
Which means that the struggle

55
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,900
would have taken place elsewhere... uphill, presumably.

56
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,700
Injured animals tend to move downhill, of course.

57
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,800
Do you have any actual facts?

58
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,800
Well, it's an actual fact that you dislike Mr. Maclean here

59
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,700
because he's a tree-hugging, liberal wacko.

60
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,534
He's probably running some kind of a cult,

61
00:03:34,534 --> 00:03:36,599
and he dislikes you because you're a small-minded,

62
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:39,300
provincial hayseed... not that you are, necessarily.

63
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:46,000
- That's just what he thinks.  - Facts pertaining to this poor boy.

64
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,700
There was no moon last night, so it was very dark.

65
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,200
Justin wouldn't have been able to move very far,

66
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,999
injured as he was.

67
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:56,400
He had a lot of dirt in his hair,

68
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,400
a lot of dirt in his ears

69
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,400
and deep up under his nails.

70
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,400
So somewhere close by,

71
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,767
somewhere very close by,

72
00:04:04,767 --> 00:04:09,634
there's a spot where someone, uh...

73
00:04:10,934 --> 00:04:13,333
where someone buried him alive.

74
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:16,000
Oh, my god.

75
00:04:28,638 --> 00:04:30,402
All right, all right, all right!

76
00:04:30,402 --> 00:04:32,769
Settle down, folks.

77
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:36,103
Take your seats.

78
00:04:36,103 --> 00:04:39,436
Let's go.

79
00:04:43,269 --> 00:04:45,802
I know the last couple of days have been rough.

80
00:04:45,802 --> 00:04:48,303
Losing Justin hurts.

81
00:04:48,303 --> 00:04:51,902
But his death cannot become your crutch

82
00:04:51,902 --> 00:04:54,236
for a negative attitude.

83
00:04:54,236 --> 00:05:00,003
You can learn and grow from this experience.

84
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:02,602
Bryan.

85
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:05,470
Sir, do we still get to do the sacred fire ceremony

86
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:09,269
- On friday?  - I think there's all the more reason do it now.

87
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:12,403
We need healing. All right, listen, kids,

88
00:05:12,403 --> 00:05:15,403
The strangers you see here are detectives

89
00:05:15,403 --> 00:05:19,569
that will be investigating the situation with Justin.

90
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,769
They are here to find out what happened to him,

91
00:05:22,769 --> 00:05:26,535
and I want all of you to answer any questions they have

92
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:28,669
as best you can.

93
00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:30,702
Yes, yes, yes, people?

94
00:05:30,702 --> 00:05:33,769
Yes, yes, yes!

95
00:05:33,769 --> 00:05:36,169
Is it true that he was buried alive?

96
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,569
- Orrin.  - Oh, yeah, that is true.

97
00:05:39,569 --> 00:05:42,635
- Who did it?  - That's enough, Elliot.

98
00:05:42,635 --> 00:05:45,669
Let's all get back to our classes quickly.

99
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:47,635
We're wasting daylight!

100
00:05:47,635 --> 00:05:49,702
You guys go and talk to the counselors.

101
00:05:49,702 --> 00:05:51,003
We'll press the principal, see what he knows.

102
00:05:51,003 --> 00:05:53,403
- We'll talk to the kids last.  - Okay.

103
00:05:53,403 --> 00:05:57,203
- Mr. Maclean, I wanted to...  - Agent Lisbon, excuse me. Orrin.

104
00:05:57,203 --> 00:06:02,036
We speak only when recognized as part of the discussion.

105
00:06:03,036 --> 00:06:05,303
Okay? Get out of here.

106
00:06:05,303 --> 00:06:08,203
I'm sorry about that. Well, welcome to Bright Arch.

107
00:06:08,203 --> 00:06:10,635
Shall we, uh, convene in my office?

108
00:06:10,635 --> 00:06:12,470
Yes, yes, yes.

109
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:15,003
Honey, just try to calm down a little bit, okay?

110
00:06:15,003 --> 00:06:17,936
- We'll find everything out. Calm down.  - You son of a bitch. What  
happened?

111
00:06:17,936 --> 00:06:21,702
- What happened? What did you do?  - Mr. Prentiss... David, let's be calm  
now.

112
00:06:21,702 --> 00:06:24,069
Step back, sir. Now.

113
00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:27,170
It's okay.

114
00:06:28,535 --> 00:06:31,636
This man was supposed to look after my son.

115
00:06:31,636 --> 00:06:33,569
It's his responsibility to keep his students safe,

116
00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:36,502
and he didn't!

117
00:06:36,502 --> 00:06:38,503
- He didn't!  - David!

118
00:06:38,503 --> 00:06:41,136
Mr. Prentiss, let's go and talk. This way.

119
00:06:41,136 --> 00:06:44,936
This way now.

120
00:06:47,736 --> 00:06:50,169
How did you learn about Bright Arch?

121
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:52,702
One of David's colleagues

122
00:06:52,702 --> 00:06:55,502
has a child who had gone way offtrack.

123
00:06:55,502 --> 00:06:59,069
And they saw very positive results from the program.

124
00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:00,635
Justin was misbehaving?

125
00:07:00,635 --> 00:07:03,303
He changed a lot over the last year.

126
00:07:03,303 --> 00:07:06,403
Suddenly he was always locked in his room, dour,

127
00:07:06,403 --> 00:07:09,436
uncommunicative, violent on occasion.

128
00:07:09,436 --> 00:07:11,303
Therapy didn't work.

129
00:07:11,303 --> 00:07:13,203
What kind of violence did he engage in?

130
00:07:13,203 --> 00:07:16,702
He often shouted at me and would threaten his father.

131
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:18,169
Just shouting?

132
00:07:18,169 --> 00:07:20,569
No physical abuse, no criminal behavior?

133
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:23,203
No.

134
00:07:26,269 --> 00:07:30,069
Please find out who did this.

135
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:33,903
Please.

136
00:07:34,936 --> 00:07:37,403
Kids love to feed off the drama of things like this.

137
00:07:37,403 --> 00:07:40,203
I hope it can be resolved quickly.

138
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:45,170
You know, you look like Burt Reynolds in this shot.

139
00:07:47,103 --> 00:07:50,869
How long has Bright Arch been running?

140
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:52,269
Almost ten years now.

141
00:07:52,269 --> 00:07:54,203
And that was all of the students?

142
00:07:54,203 --> 00:07:56,736
Yes, we like to keep a low counselor/student ratio

143
00:07:56,736 --> 00:07:58,635
so that everyone gets the focused,

144
00:07:58,635 --> 00:08:00,569
individual attention that they need.

145
00:08:00,569 --> 00:08:03,402
Right. What's the pitch?

146
00:08:04,372 --> 00:08:05,764
I don't follow.

147
00:08:05,764 --> 00:08:07,364
The pitch... the gimmick, the hook.

148
00:08:07,364 --> 00:08:10,580
- How do you sell this place to prospective parents?  - Oh, we really don't  
have to sell it.

149
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,468
They come by word of mouth.

150
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,347
This is a simple, natural healing community

151
00:08:13,347 --> 00:08:18,913
where your, uh, troubled and underachieving

152
00:08:18,913 --> 00:08:20,346
sons and daughters are encouraged to get in touch

153
00:08:20,346 --> 00:08:23,380
- with their inner resources.  - Encouraged how?

154
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,080
By a code of honor and discipline,

155
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,380
by learning wilderness skills and teamwork

156
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:31,313
through an up-close experience with mother nature.

157
00:08:31,313 --> 00:08:35,414
That's a good pitch. It's a good program.

158
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:41,080
- Yes, Cassie?  - Um, I got your tea.

159
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,846
Oh. Thank you.

160
00:08:52,447 --> 00:08:56,980
One of our, uh, our great success stories.

161
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,080
Arrived here about nine months ago angry and withdrawn.

162
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,013
- She's blossomed wonderfully.  - Tell me about Justin.

163
00:09:03,013 --> 00:09:05,980
Why was he wearing an electronic monitoring device?

164
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:09,580
- I looked around. I didn't see anyone else wearing one.  - Justin had only  
been with us three months.

165
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,514
He was still in the rebellious phase.

166
00:09:11,514 --> 00:09:14,280
Day before yesterday, he left campus without permission

167
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,779
for several hours.

168
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:19,000
He refused to tell us where he had been and with whom.

169
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,980
His punishment was eight hours in the reflection room

170
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:26,013
and the electronic monitoring device for, uh, two weeks.

171
00:09:26,013 --> 00:09:28,013
Confinement and dog collars.

172
00:09:28,013 --> 00:09:31,180
Yeah, that'll certainly, uh, encourage the discovery

173
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,000
of inner resources, I guess.

174
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,046
- But do the kids' parents know that's part of the deal?  - It's in the  
brochure. Page three.

175
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:43,347
So you must get a lot of problem kids.

176
00:09:44,813 --> 00:09:46,013
How do you handle the psychos...

177
00:09:46,013 --> 00:09:48,680
The ones that just won't knuckle under no matter what?

178
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,613
We don't take 'em in the first place.

179
00:09:50,613 --> 00:09:54,747
- I went thoroughly every acceptance.  - So no name jumped into your head  
when you heard about the murder?

180
00:09:54,747 --> 00:09:58,580
- No.  - You ever heard of z krew?

181
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:01,414
No. What's that?

182
00:10:02,647 --> 00:10:06,013
I'd like to talk to Justin's friends.

183
00:10:06,013 --> 00:10:09,146
- Of course. He was in missy Jenkins' teaching pod.  - Great.

184
00:10:09,146 --> 00:10:11,580
Bear in mind that I or one of my staff members

185
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,680
need to be present before you talk with any of our students.

186
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,946
- Is that right?  - It's the law.

187
00:10:17,946 --> 00:10:20,113
Really?

188
00:10:26,813 --> 00:10:31,680
- Ohh. I hate the woods.  - Would you rather be playing desk jockey with  
Van Pelt right now?

189
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,580
Who sends their kids to a place like this?

190
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,513
It's not cheap, either.

191
00:10:36,513 --> 00:10:38,680
Eh, a little deprivation and discipline

192
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,647
- Is good for the soul.  - Yeah, but this is like a juvie prison camp.

193
00:10:41,647 --> 00:10:45,714
No, this is like spring break in Cancun compared to juvie.

194
00:10:45,714 --> 00:10:47,879
Wait. You were in juvenile hall? Seriously?

195
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:50,680
Yeah. You didn't read my file?

196
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,714
No. Why, did you read mine?

197
00:10:52,714 --> 00:10:54,946
Of course.

198
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,380
What have we got?

199
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,980
Look at this.

200
00:11:04,313 --> 00:11:08,347
Interesting, huh?

201
00:11:08,347 --> 00:11:10,513
Maybe there's treasure involved.

202
00:11:10,513 --> 00:11:12,046
Maybe not.

203
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,880
Follow the trail. Find out.

204
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,380
So over and under...

205
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,213
Over...

206
00:11:23,213 --> 00:11:25,347
And under...

207
00:11:25,347 --> 00:11:27,146
And through.

208
00:11:27,146 --> 00:11:28,513
Simple. Again.

209
00:11:28,513 --> 00:11:31,313
Over and under

210
00:11:31,313 --> 00:11:33,913
And over...

211
00:11:33,913 --> 00:11:36,046
And under. 

212
00:11:36,046 --> 00:11:39,980
Chris! Hit the reflection room.

213
00:11:40,946 --> 00:11:44,046
One hour.

214
00:11:44,046 --> 00:11:47,080
- Marley, give me 25.  - But he started it.

215
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,779
Yeah, I hear you, and I do not care. 25. 

216
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:52,913
Hey, lady!

217
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:57,879
- Are you talking to me?  - Yeah, I'm talking to you. This is important. Look at me.

218
00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:01,614
CBI. That's police. There'll be no backchat.

219
00:12:01,614 --> 00:12:04,046
- You do exactly as I tell you.  - What?

220
00:12:04,046 --> 00:12:07,913
Hold this.

221
00:12:07,913 --> 00:12:10,113
CBI...

222
00:12:10,113 --> 00:12:13,447
California Bureau of Investigation.

223
00:12:13,447 --> 00:12:17,113
Well, ma'am, we have reason to believe...

224
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:26,879
Untie me this instant.

225
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,380
- Sorry, ma'am. Your boss Mr. Maclean told me to do that.  - No, he didn't.

226
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,000
Yes, he did. He's in his office right now.

227
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,347
Go and ask him. 

228
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,113
Okay, my people, we have precious little time

229
00:12:43,113 --> 00:12:45,113
Until our friend returns.

230
00:12:45,113 --> 00:12:48,480
I need to know who knows the most about what around here.

231
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,946
Elliot's been here, like, two years,

232
00:12:50,946 --> 00:12:53,980
- So he knows everything.  - Wow, that's a long time to be stuck out in the woods, huh?

233
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:57,447
- I like it here.  - Yeah? So what's the deal with Justin?

234
00:12:57,447 --> 00:13:01,146
- Who disliked him?  - Nobody, He was fine.

235
00:13:01,146 --> 00:13:06,114
- Oh, you say that like he was a prize jerk.  - No, He wouldn't win any prizes.

236
00:13:06,114 --> 00:13:08,246
I mean, he was basically a good kid.

237
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:11,880
But he just fought a lot with everybody.

238
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:16,546
What do you think he was doing out in the woods?

239
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:18,883
Who knows?

240
00:13:18,883 --> 00:13:21,100
- The woods are a bad place.  - Yeah? Why is that?

241
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:26,134
The axman Zachariah lives there.

242
00:13:26,134 --> 00:13:27,834
Who's Zachariah?

243
00:13:27,834 --> 00:13:30,200
There is no Zachariah.

244
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,000
It's... it's just a story.

245
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,734
- Yeah, I was just kidding.  - No, you weren't.

246
00:13:35,734 --> 00:13:36,600
Come on, guys.

247
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,400
- Aren't you a little old to believe in stuff like that?  - A year ago...

248
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,467
They found a townie kid dead in the woods.

249
00:13:43,467 --> 00:13:45,500
He'd been chopped up with an ax.

250
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,801
His head was 20 feet up in a tree

251
00:13:47,801 --> 00:13:50,167
With a crazy look on his face.

252
00:13:50,167 --> 00:13:57,100
Okay. Now does Zachariah have anything to do with Z Krew?

253
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,233
Was Justin in Z Krew?

254
00:14:03,233 --> 00:14:04,567
Jane?

255
00:14:04,567 --> 00:14:07,000
Jane! What the hell are you playing at?

256
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,233
You can't tie people up.

257
00:14:09,233 --> 00:14:11,834
- Uh, yeah. Sorry.  - I should think you would be.

258
00:14:11,834 --> 00:14:14,734
My apologies, Mr. Maclean.

259
00:14:14,734 --> 00:14:18,367
We'll be back tomorrow morning if that's convenient.

260
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,367
See you in the morning.

261
00:14:20,367 --> 00:14:23,734
I hope you got something useful for all the trouble you caused.

262
00:14:23,734 --> 00:14:27,267
Yes, I did... the story of the mad axman Zachariah

263
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:29,667
- Who lives in these here woods.  - Ah, "z."

264
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:31,834
Yes, "z." I would have gotten more out of 'em,

265
00:14:31,834 --> 00:14:35,066
- But you came back too quickly.  - Reality check... I'm your supervising agent.

266
00:14:35,066 --> 00:14:38,033
I'm not your decoy.

267
00:14:42,033 --> 00:14:44,500
So, uh, what did it say?

268
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,100
What?

269
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,267
You know, my file.

270
00:14:48,267 --> 00:14:50,434
You haven't read your own file?

271
00:14:50,434 --> 00:14:53,300
- No. It's against the rules.  - You're kidding.

272
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,567
What? I like rules. Why be a cop if you don't like rules?

273
00:14:56,567 --> 00:15:00,000
- Come on. What did it say?  - You know what it says. It's your life.

274
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I didn't know you were adopted,

275
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,734
- But other than that, no surprises.  - Adopted? What?

276
00:15:04,734 --> 00:15:06,600
Kidding.

277
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,933
Ha ha, very funny.

278
00:15:08,933 --> 00:15:11,734
So why were you in juvie?

279
00:15:11,734 --> 00:15:14,634
You know. The usual reasons.

280
00:15:24,167 --> 00:15:26,600
That has a mark on this map with a skull and crossbones.

281
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,600
So what are the usual reasons for being in juvie?

282
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,900
I'll tell you all about it sometime.

283
00:15:33,734 --> 00:15:36,667
Hey, check this out.

284
00:15:42,434 --> 00:15:44,300
Looks like Justin's shoe.

285
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,567
Yep.

286
00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:48,967
- I'll call forensics, mark it up.  - Yeah.

287
00:15:55,734 --> 00:15:59,000
Hello? CBI!

288
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,600
Anybody home?

289
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,866
Hello?

290
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,733
CBI!

291
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,966
Try the other side?

292
00:16:16,966 --> 00:16:19,800
Yeah.

293
00:16:22,734 --> 00:16:24,700
You move, you die,

294
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:28,842
You mameluke sons of bitches!

295
00:16:28,842 --> 00:16:31,181
- Kneel down!  - Hey, we're cops.

296
00:16:31,181 --> 00:16:32,611
Kneel!

297
00:16:34,248 --> 00:16:37,749
I'm... a blow your damn faces off you, you hear?

298
00:16:37,749 --> 00:16:39,915
Eh, eh, eh! Winston! Come on!

299
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:43,981
Winston, you fool. Put that gun down. Let go.

300
00:16:47,982 --> 00:16:50,002
- Thank you.  - No problem.

301
00:16:50,002 --> 00:16:55,815
- Yeah, thanks. What are you doing here?  - Winston called 911. Lucky I was close.

302
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:59,515
Can you please tell me why I'm still here?

303
00:16:59,515 --> 00:17:02,448
I had nothing to do with that kid who died. Nothing.

304
00:17:02,448 --> 00:17:03,582
You're here because you assaulted us.

305
00:17:03,582 --> 00:17:07,981
- But if you want to talk about Justin Prentiss, that's fine.  - How am I supposed to know who you are?

306
00:17:07,981 --> 00:17:10,849
You're bangin' on my doors, "CBI! CBI!"

307
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:13,016
Like that's supposed to mean somethin'?

308
00:17:13,016 --> 00:17:15,082
Yeah, we do need better brand awareness

309
00:17:15,082 --> 00:17:16,716
But your response was disproportionate.

310
00:17:16,716 --> 00:17:19,682
You brandished a firearm. So here we are.

311
00:17:19,682 --> 00:17:23,148
My security alarm went off.

312
00:17:23,148 --> 00:17:25,715
I was loaded. I reacted.

313
00:17:25,715 --> 00:17:28,582
- That's all.  - You're very security-conscious. Why is that?

314
00:17:28,582 --> 00:17:32,815
Why not? Are there people out there who dislike security?

315
00:17:32,815 --> 00:17:34,048
What's been your history of contact

316
00:17:34,048 --> 00:17:40,749
- With the students from Bright Arch?  -Zero. I have a zero history of contact.

317
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:49,415
You know the kid who was killed, Justin Prentiss,

318
00:17:49,415 --> 00:17:51,715
Who was buried close to your property line?

319
00:17:51,715 --> 00:17:54,116
He had a sketch map that showed the way to your house

320
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:56,348
Marked with a skull and crossbones.

321
00:17:56,348 --> 00:17:59,949
- I don't know what that means.  - How about Zachariah? That name ring any bells?

322
00:17:59,949 --> 00:18:01,816
No.

323
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:06,181
Looks like it's gonna be a long night.

324
00:18:06,181 --> 00:18:08,181
I just want to be left alone

325
00:18:08,181 --> 00:18:11,315
And I want those kids to leave me alone!

326
00:18:11,315 --> 00:18:13,615
They go up to my property, mess with my stuff.

327
00:18:13,615 --> 00:18:16,715
They break windows. They spray paint my doors

328
00:18:16,715 --> 00:18:19,649
pull all kinds of stunts all night,

329
00:18:19,649 --> 00:18:21,815
Like a routine.

330
00:18:21,815 --> 00:18:23,882
Okay. So what did you do in response?

331
00:18:23,882 --> 00:18:27,649
I did everything to try and stop them short of actual violence.

332
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:29,649
I built fences.

333
00:18:29,649 --> 00:18:32,315
I planted poison oak.

334
00:18:32,315 --> 00:18:33,949
I installed alarms.

335
00:18:33,949 --> 00:18:36,649
They just took it all like it was a game.

336
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:39,148
- Were they at your house last night?  - The night before...

337
00:18:39,148 --> 00:18:43,448
Three or four of 'em, throwing balloons of red paint.

338
00:18:43,448 --> 00:18:46,448
Would you be able to identify any of the kids involved

339
00:18:46,448 --> 00:18:50,682
- If you saw them again?  - They always wore masks.

340
00:19:05,915 --> 00:19:09,248
I want to apologize for the misunderstanding yesterday.

341
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:13,582
- Mr. Jane will comport himself properly today.  - Yes, I will.

342
00:19:15,415 --> 00:19:18,582
Who's Zachariah?

343
00:19:18,582 --> 00:19:20,749
- Who?  - Zachariah.

344
00:19:20,749 --> 00:19:23,749
- Never heard of him. Who is he?  -Liar.

345
00:19:23,749 --> 00:19:25,782
- "liar"?  - Pants on fire.

346
00:19:25,782 --> 00:19:28,248
- They're ablaze.  - I want to cooperate with you people.

347
00:19:28,248 --> 00:19:31,181
But this man is trying to... I don't know what he is trying

348
00:19:31,181 --> 00:19:34,348
- To do, but I resent it.  - You should know that you sound more than a little paranoid

349
00:19:34,348 --> 00:19:38,215
- When you talk like that.  -This is what I'm talking about. How is this police work?

350
00:19:38,215 --> 00:19:40,515
Oh, I'm kidding with you. I get bored.

351
00:19:40,515 --> 00:19:42,308
See, the thing is, you have heard of Zachariah.

352
00:19:42,308 --> 00:19:45,449
You know who Zachariah is, and you're scared of Zachariah.

353
00:19:45,449 --> 00:19:49,515
- And we're gonna find out why.  - Let's put a pin in that, shall we?

354
00:19:49,515 --> 00:19:52,182
We have information putting Justin Prentiss,

355
00:19:52,182 --> 00:19:54,949
At mr. Winston's house the night he went awol.

356
00:19:54,949 --> 00:19:57,581
He went up there on a regular basis with a group of kids,

357
00:19:57,581 --> 00:20:01,215
- To torment Mr. Winston.  - So says Mr. Winston. Has he any proof?

358
00:20:01,215 --> 00:20:04,949
- Why would he lie?  - Because he's a crazy old man with a...

359
00:20:04,949 --> 00:20:07,482
With a grudge against this school.

360
00:20:07,482 --> 00:20:09,382
Perhaps he's crazy enough to do something.

361
00:20:09,382 --> 00:20:12,615
He's complained plenty of times. There's never any reality to it.

362
00:20:12,615 --> 00:20:14,282
Chief brody disagrees.

363
00:20:14,282 --> 00:20:16,749
She thinks that some of your students are vandals,

364
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:21,715
And you're protecting them. Chief brody is a small town cop. She gets ideas in her head.

365
00:20:21,715 --> 00:20:25,382
Look, the truth is that nobody around here likes us very much.

366
00:20:25,382 --> 00:20:28,315
They think the kids are all drug addicts and delinquents.

367
00:20:28,315 --> 00:20:32,248
They're scared. You don't mind if we sit down with some of your students

368
00:20:32,248 --> 00:20:34,248
To ask them about mr. Winston's allegations?

369
00:20:34,248 --> 00:20:37,181
Not at all...

370
00:20:37,181 --> 00:20:42,582
As long as you follow proper legal protocol.

371
00:20:43,582 --> 00:20:46,215
Of course.

372
00:20:46,415 --> 00:20:48,916
Hey, hey, hey!

373
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,181
Agent lisbon of the cbi,

374
00:20:51,181 --> 00:20:53,316
Would like to talk to you for a moment.

375
00:20:53,316 --> 00:20:58,881
Let's all listen with respectful attention, all right?

376
00:21:01,315 --> 00:21:05,749
Jane, they're all yours.

377
00:21:07,615 --> 00:21:10,615
Hello, kids. Hey.

378
00:21:10,615 --> 00:21:12,615
Uh, that's the best you got?

379
00:21:12,615 --> 00:21:13,815
Hello, kids.

380
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:15,448
Hello!

381
00:21:15,448 --> 00:21:19,148
Ah, thank you. Thank you.

382
00:21:19,148 --> 00:21:22,115
Ahh. Who wants to see some magic?

383
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:25,448
Hands? Good.

384
00:21:25,448 --> 00:21:29,482
Watch me closely.

385
00:21:31,815 --> 00:21:35,549
Concentrate.

386
00:21:37,582 --> 00:21:40,849
Make sure I don't do anything sneaky.

387
00:21:40,849 --> 00:21:42,815
All right, this is ridiculous. Hush.

388
00:21:42,815 --> 00:21:47,082
Watching my hands...

389
00:21:53,248 --> 00:21:56,916
I'm gonna need a volunteer.

390
00:21:56,916 --> 00:22:00,315
You.

391
00:22:00,315 --> 00:22:03,582
Stand up. Come here.

392
00:22:06,882 --> 00:22:08,815
Name?

393
00:22:08,815 --> 00:22:10,009
Orrin.

394
00:22:10,009 --> 00:22:11,976
Well, orrin, today's your lucky day.

395
00:22:11,976 --> 00:22:13,942
I'm going to look into your mind,

396
00:22:13,942 --> 00:22:16,742
And I'm gonna read your thoughts.

397
00:22:27,942 --> 00:22:31,541
You're thinking, "gosh, I hope he can't read my thoughts,

398
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:33,976
"because then he'd know that I was up in the woods

399
00:22:33,976 --> 00:22:36,542
"with justin prentiss the night before he died

400
00:22:36,542 --> 00:22:41,642
Throwing paint bombs at the old crazy man's door."

401
00:22:44,609 --> 00:22:47,142
Orrin, that was kind of dumb.

402
00:22:47,142 --> 00:22:48,575
You should have thought of something

403
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:51,409
A little more innocent.

404
00:22:52,675 --> 00:22:56,509
We're gonna have to have a little talk.

405
00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:59,942
Follow me.

406
00:22:59,942 --> 00:23:02,742
Sorry about that.

407
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,371
Tell me more about Zachariah.

408
00:23:13,371 --> 00:23:18,504
- Orrin, you may ask for a lawyer at any time.  - Then my parents will know, right?

409
00:23:18,504 --> 00:23:19,903
Yes.

410
00:23:19,903 --> 00:23:21,503
That's okay.

411
00:23:21,503 --> 00:23:24,837
Zachariah and the Z krew.

412
00:23:24,837 --> 00:23:28,071
Why should I tell you? You know what I'm thinking.

413
00:23:28,071 --> 00:23:31,171
Yeah. But it would be more polite

414
00:23:31,171 --> 00:23:33,704
If you said it aloud for their benefit.

415
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:37,904
You can't really read minds, can you?

416
00:23:37,904 --> 00:23:40,137
Shrewd insight. No, of course I can't.

417
00:23:40,137 --> 00:23:42,804
Then how'd you do that, then-- call me out like that?

418
00:23:42,804 --> 00:23:44,770
You scratched your poison oak rash,

419
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:46,937
And my colleagues tell me that only grows in one place

420
00:23:46,937 --> 00:23:50,537
- around here-- up at Mr. Winston's.  - Fudge.

421
00:23:50,537 --> 00:23:54,037
Yeah. So tell me more about zachariah.

422
00:23:54,037 --> 00:23:56,170
I can't.

423
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,504
Really?

424
00:23:57,504 --> 00:23:59,371
Orrin...

425
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:02,537
We can let this go, or we can take it to the next level.

426
00:24:02,537 --> 00:24:06,337
And that's gonna involve your parents and lawyers.

427
00:24:10,104 --> 00:24:12,104
Zachariah was a lumberjack...

428
00:24:12,104 --> 00:24:13,971
Mm-hmm. Hundreds of years ago.

429
00:24:13,971 --> 00:24:17,271
A log fell on him in the river and pinned him by the arm.

430
00:24:17,271 --> 00:24:20,671
His logging crew tried, but they couldn't get him out.

431
00:24:20,671 --> 00:24:23,170
The river was rising, and a snowstorm was coming.

432
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,671
They figured that he was done for anyway.

433
00:24:25,671 --> 00:24:28,837
So they left him there-- left him for dead.

434
00:24:28,837 --> 00:24:31,437
Zachariah was so angry at them for leaving him

435
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:33,671
that he chopped off his own arm to free himself,

436
00:24:33,671 --> 00:24:35,738
then went back to the lumber camp

437
00:24:35,738 --> 00:24:38,404
and hacked every one of his workmates to death,

438
00:24:38,404 --> 00:24:41,303
then chopped them up and put their heads in trees.

439
00:24:41,303 --> 00:24:42,904
Cool.

440
00:24:42,904 --> 00:24:45,337
- The lumber camp where they died...  - Mm-hmm.

441
00:24:45,337 --> 00:24:47,071
This is it.

442
00:24:47,071 --> 00:24:48,771
Right here.

443
00:24:48,771 --> 00:24:51,971
This school is the exact same spot.

444
00:24:53,171 --> 00:24:55,971
- And z krew?  - It's like a secret club.

445
00:24:55,971 --> 00:24:58,437
We go up in the woods and do stuff.

446
00:24:58,437 --> 00:25:01,771
Zachariah is like our leader.

447
00:25:01,771 --> 00:25:04,771
- Who's like the deputy leader?  - I don't know.

448
00:25:04,771 --> 00:25:06,937
- No?  - Come on.

449
00:25:06,937 --> 00:25:09,238
We wear masks. The only person you know

450
00:25:09,238 --> 00:25:14,504
- is the person who asked you to join the gang.  - Who was that?

451
00:25:15,504 --> 00:25:17,938
Bryan.

452
00:25:20,171 --> 00:25:21,704
There he is.

453
00:25:21,704 --> 00:25:25,437
- I got this.  - No, please. I got this.

454
00:25:26,604 --> 00:25:29,871
After you.

455
00:25:38,804 --> 00:25:40,071
Nice.

456
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:44,771
- Who initiated you to z krew, Bryan?  - The guy that jumped me in left last year.

457
00:25:44,771 --> 00:25:46,604
- Who runs Z krew?  - I don't know.

458
00:25:46,604 --> 00:25:48,537
I find it hard to believe you didn't recognize

459
00:25:48,537 --> 00:25:51,371
- anybody's voice.  - There's no talking on Z krew ops.

460
00:25:51,371 --> 00:25:53,803
We only communicate by note and sign language.

461
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:57,870
That's the whole fun of it. Look, z krew's about

462
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:59,870
running around in the woods, playing warriors.

463
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:01,437
Nobody gets killed.

464
00:26:01,437 --> 00:26:04,471
Z krew's got nothing to do with Justin's murder.

465
00:26:04,471 --> 00:26:05,604
Do you?

466
00:26:05,604 --> 00:26:08,537
No!

467
00:26:08,537 --> 00:26:11,371
You want my guess?

468
00:26:11,371 --> 00:26:15,204
Guesswork is inappropriate for this sort of situation, Bryan.

469
00:26:15,204 --> 00:26:18,937
Guesswork's okay. 

470
00:26:18,937 --> 00:26:21,403
Cassie.

471
00:26:21,403 --> 00:26:23,338
She's in it somehow.

472
00:26:23,338 --> 00:26:24,804
How so?

473
00:26:24,804 --> 00:26:27,670
Justin was... 

474
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:30,104
He was big in love with her.

475
00:26:30,104 --> 00:26:32,637
She wouldn't deal, and he didn't like it.

476
00:26:32,637 --> 00:26:34,937
I saw them arguing,

477
00:26:34,937 --> 00:26:37,137
Both real mad, a couple days ago.

478
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:40,404
And now she's totally freaked out about his death.

479
00:26:40,404 --> 00:26:44,471
- So, you know...  - Many of us are upset, Bryan.

480
00:26:44,471 --> 00:26:47,671
- Does Cassie have a boyfriend?  - No.

481
00:26:47,671 --> 00:26:51,237
So what do you think happened? Cassie killed him?

482
00:26:51,237 --> 00:26:52,737
That's ridiculous.

483
00:26:52,737 --> 00:26:54,938
Let him answer.

484
00:26:54,938 --> 00:26:57,137
Hey... Ask her.

485
00:26:57,137 --> 00:27:00,304
All I'm saying... It wasn't me.

486
00:27:00,304 --> 00:27:03,704
Do you know where we can find Cassie right now?

487
00:27:03,704 --> 00:27:07,704
I'm sure that she has nothing to do with this.

488
00:27:07,704 --> 00:27:12,903
But I will have someone fetch her for you.

489
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:19,204
- Gave you a little trouble, huh?  - Nah.

490
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:21,770
Hey, guys.

491
00:27:23,204 --> 00:27:25,170
- What happened to you?  - Old age.

492
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:26,970
Shut up, you.

493
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:30,103
- What are you doing here?  - Gee, thanks for the welcome.

494
00:27:30,103 --> 00:27:33,571
- No, I mean-- you know what I mean.  - Lisbon wanted an extra hand

495
00:27:33,571 --> 00:27:34,671
If we're gonna have to interview

496
00:27:34,671 --> 00:27:39,137
- all the students and staff.  - Seriously? This is the biggest they had?

497
00:27:39,137 --> 00:27:41,604
- Hey, Van Pelt.  - Hey, boss.

498
00:27:41,604 --> 00:27:44,327
We're short a girl by the name Cassie Miniver.

499
00:27:44,327 --> 00:27:46,394
Bryan says that Justin was in love the Cassie,

500
00:27:46,394 --> 00:27:48,393
Recently saw them in a fierce argument.

501
00:27:48,393 --> 00:27:51,027
Oh, Cassie. Yeah, she brought Maclean a cup of tea.

502
00:27:51,027 --> 00:27:55,560
- Yeah. We wanted to question her, but she's gone.  - Hmm. Interesting.

503
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,260
- Anybody else missing?  - No, there isn't.

504
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:01,294
- So she's most likely running, not abducted.  - Precisely.

505
00:28:01,294 --> 00:28:04,760
So what do you think, boss? Chief brody's setting up a full-scale search,

506
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,994
So we should probably start looking in the woods

507
00:28:06,994 --> 00:28:09,494
- Around the school.  - Oh, that sounds horribly tedious.

508
00:28:09,494 --> 00:28:11,427
Shout if you need me.

509
00:28:11,427 --> 00:28:14,094
Go ahead, relax. Enjoy yourself.

510
00:28:14,094 --> 00:28:17,860
God forbid you should do anything tedious.

511
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,594
Cassie!  Cassie!

512
00:28:23,594 --> 00:28:26,594
Cassie!  Cassie!

513
00:28:26,594 --> 00:28:28,361
Cassie!

514
00:28:28,361 --> 00:28:31,428
Cassie!

515
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:36,793
Can I ask you something?

516
00:28:36,793 --> 00:28:39,294
Would you-- have you ever read

517
00:28:39,294 --> 00:28:41,694
Your coworker's personnel files?

518
00:28:41,694 --> 00:28:44,728
Uh... No. Why?

519
00:28:44,728 --> 00:28:47,561
No, uh, good. Neither did I.

520
00:28:47,561 --> 00:28:50,528
Good.

521
00:29:11,361 --> 00:29:14,694
Hey.

522
00:29:14,694 --> 00:29:18,094
Hi.

523
00:29:18,094 --> 00:29:20,327
Where are you headed?

524
00:29:20,327 --> 00:29:22,127
Into town.

525
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:25,793
Excellent. That's exactly where I need to go.

526
00:29:25,793 --> 00:29:29,894
All right.

527
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:37,261
Thanks. Grateful.

528
00:29:49,194 --> 00:29:51,661
Would you shut the gate for me, please?

529
00:29:51,661 --> 00:29:54,361
- Uh, nope.  - Why?

530
00:29:54,361 --> 00:29:56,760
Well, 'cause as soon as I get out of the car,

531
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,694
then you'll drive away without me.

532
00:29:59,694 --> 00:30:02,327
Why on earth would I do that?

533
00:30:02,327 --> 00:30:04,127
The three Furies...

534
00:30:04,127 --> 00:30:05,760
Fear, shame, guilt.

535
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,160
What?

536
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,694
The heart wants what the heart wants,

537
00:30:09,694 --> 00:30:12,893
and it won't be denied. It makes us do bad things.

538
00:30:12,893 --> 00:30:16,494
What are you talking about?

539
00:30:16,694 --> 00:30:20,593
Cassie, I have a gift for you.

540
00:30:23,694 --> 00:30:27,894
Cassie? Needn't be shy.

541
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,927
Hi.

542
00:30:33,927 --> 00:30:36,161
Hi.

543
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:41,760
Here.

544
00:30:43,927 --> 00:30:46,860
Try it on.

545
00:30:51,394 --> 00:30:54,461
Beautiful.

546
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:10,970
Ta-da.

547
00:31:11,249 --> 00:31:13,314
What is this?

548
00:31:13,314 --> 00:31:16,166
Mr. Maclean was helping Cassie run away.

549
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:21,747
- Why?  - He didn't want us to speak to her because...

550
00:31:21,747 --> 00:31:24,847
- I have nothing to say.  - Nonsense. You have plenty to say.

551
00:31:24,847 --> 00:31:28,713
He wanted her to go before we get a chance to talk to her

552
00:31:28,713 --> 00:31:31,980
and find out that she and he were having

553
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:35,513
what you would call, uh... sexual relations.

554
00:31:35,513 --> 00:31:37,847
Is that true?

555
00:31:37,847 --> 00:31:39,247
I'm saying nothing. I admit nothing.

556
00:31:39,247 --> 00:31:41,613
I want to talk to my lawyer. Cassie!

557
00:31:41,613 --> 00:31:45,513
- Don't say anything.  - You miserable little pervert!

558
00:31:45,513 --> 00:31:47,847
- That's enough, chief.  - She assaulted me!

559
00:31:47,847 --> 00:31:50,780
I don't think so. We're going back to Sacramento.

560
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:53,313
Now you can either come of your own accord

561
00:31:53,313 --> 00:31:56,614
or we can arrest you. Which is it?

562
00:31:56,614 --> 00:31:58,813
Fine.

563
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,614
Good choice.

564
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:11,447
No. We didn't.

565
00:32:11,447 --> 00:32:14,981
We... we weren't. No.

566
00:32:14,981 --> 00:32:16,914
Cassie... 

567
00:32:16,914 --> 00:32:19,481
Look at me. It's very easy to see when you're lying.

568
00:32:19,481 --> 00:32:22,414
You get a little pulse going in your neck just... there.

569
00:32:22,414 --> 00:32:23,613
Yeah.

570
00:32:23,613 --> 00:32:27,613
Always best to tell Agent Lisbon the truth.

571
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:32,647
Did Mr. Maclean have sexual relations with you?

572
00:32:36,114 --> 00:32:38,047
It's okay.

573
00:32:38,047 --> 00:32:40,780
Yes, he did.

574
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,813
One time or more than that?

575
00:32:42,813 --> 00:32:44,713
More.

576
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:47,613
Maybe twice a week for a few months.

577
00:32:47,613 --> 00:32:50,613
You know that by having sexual relations with you,

578
00:32:50,613 --> 00:32:53,280
Mr. Maclean was committing a crime, right?

579
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,714
I guess.

580
00:32:54,714 --> 00:32:57,081
Was it consensual?

581
00:32:57,081 --> 00:32:58,380
I guess.

582
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,480
You guess.

583
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,947
Uh, did you want Mr. Maclean to have sex with you?

584
00:33:03,947 --> 00:33:05,814
No, ma'am.

585
00:33:05,814 --> 00:33:07,313
So he coerced you.

586
00:33:07,313 --> 00:33:09,680
No, ma'am.

587
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,980
I don't... understand.

588
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,613
I was scared.

589
00:33:13,613 --> 00:33:16,014
Scared of who? Mr. Maclean?

590
00:33:16,014 --> 00:33:19,380
No, he's just... a sad creep.

591
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:24,247
Who, then? 

592
00:33:25,147 --> 00:33:27,714
You can talk freely, Cassie. You're safe here.

593
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:29,213
Nowhere is safe.

594
00:33:29,213 --> 00:33:32,580
Zachariah made you do it?

595
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:36,747
Zombie Lumber Jack made you sleep with mr. Maclean.

596
00:33:36,747 --> 00:33:38,346
He told me I had to.

597
00:33:38,346 --> 00:33:42,613
Cassie, you know that Zachariah doesn't exist.

598
00:33:42,613 --> 00:33:45,613
You know that kid that they found chopped up in the woods?

599
00:33:45,613 --> 00:33:48,280
He thought the same thing.

600
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,413
Okay, how... how does Zachariah tell you his wishes?

601
00:33:53,547 --> 00:33:55,581
Through somebody from Zkrew, maybe?

602
00:33:55,581 --> 00:33:57,081
I've said too much already.

603
00:33:57,081 --> 00:33:59,380
I don't... I don't want to say anymore. 

604
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,513
Please don't make me.

605
00:34:01,513 --> 00:34:05,413
I'll be right back.

606
00:34:14,147 --> 00:34:17,414
Cassie made a statement.

607
00:34:17,414 --> 00:34:19,614
Charge Mr. Maclean with statutory rape.

608
00:34:19,614 --> 00:34:22,414
Will do, boss.

609
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:29,781
Sex with a minor. Tell you what...

610
00:34:29,781 --> 00:34:34,313
- things look very bad for you right now.  - I was kind and caring to a troubled girl.

611
00:34:34,313 --> 00:34:37,080
- That... that's all.  - ... Yeah, that's what they all say...

612
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,080
until the lab tests come back.

613
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,180
See, the way we have to figure this

614
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,980
is that Justin Prentiss was in love with Cassie

615
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,980
- and found out that you were abusing her.  - Oh, please.

616
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:48,014
Abusing her, and he threatened to tell the authorities.

617
00:34:48,014 --> 00:34:51,047
- So you clubbed him to death, you thought, and buried him.  - No. No!

618
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:54,914
No? Well, that's what we're thinking.

619
00:34:56,114 --> 00:34:58,813
How are we wrong?

620
00:34:58,813 --> 00:35:00,647
Did he attack you?

621
00:35:00,647 --> 00:35:02,680
Was it self-defense, maybe?

622
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:06,880
I want my lawyer. I'm saying nothing more to you people.

623
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,546
We got nothing to put him with Justin that night.

624
00:35:10,546 --> 00:35:12,047
We need a confession.

625
00:35:12,047 --> 00:35:13,546
You won't get one.

626
00:35:13,546 --> 00:35:14,546
Why won't we get one?

627
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:17,580
Prize for the first one to tell me the answer.

628
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,580
Just tell us your damn theory.

629
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:22,580
I will do that on our way back to Bright Arch.

630
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,580
We need to get there in time for the sacred fire ritual.

631
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:28,580
Rigsby, let's you and I have a quick cup of tea,

632
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:31,080
- then we'll go, huh?  - Explain first. Then we'll go.

633
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,147
Sacred fire?

634
00:35:33,147 --> 00:35:35,947
Hello, kids.

635
00:35:35,947 --> 00:35:39,047
Good to see you all again.

636
00:35:39,047 --> 00:35:42,214
Pretty dramatic few days, huh?

637
00:35:42,214 --> 00:35:45,813
You probably heard a lot of crazy stuff

638
00:35:45,813 --> 00:35:46,813
about what's been going on.

639
00:35:46,813 --> 00:35:50,513
Well...  Don't worry about it.

640
00:35:50,513 --> 00:35:53,513
Life goes on.

641
00:35:53,713 --> 00:35:55,514
Your teachers thought I'd be good to carry on

642
00:35:55,514 --> 00:35:57,547
With the sacred fire ceremony as usual.

643
00:35:57,547 --> 00:35:59,914
Everyone okay with that?

644
00:35:59,914 --> 00:36:02,280
Excellent.

645
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,781
I thought we'd start with a ghost story.

646
00:36:04,781 --> 00:36:07,747
You all know about Zachariah, yeah?

647
00:36:07,747 --> 00:36:09,747
We do.

648
00:36:09,747 --> 00:36:12,847
- But we don't talk about him.  - It's bad luck.

649
00:36:12,847 --> 00:36:14,247
Meh.

650
00:36:14,247 --> 00:36:18,046
Zachariah doesn't scare me.

651
00:36:18,046 --> 00:36:20,547
So everyone knows about that terrible evening

652
00:36:20,547 --> 00:36:23,946
When Zachariah hacked his former friends to pieces, yeah?

653
00:36:23,946 --> 00:36:26,747
What a lot of people don't know

654
00:36:26,747 --> 00:36:30,681
is what happened after that horrible incident.

655
00:36:34,946 --> 00:36:36,514
As punishment,

656
00:36:36,514 --> 00:36:39,380
The townspeople gathered together

657
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:43,046
And built a huge bonfire

658
00:36:43,046 --> 00:36:45,247
Right here...

659
00:36:45,247 --> 00:36:47,013
On this very spot.

660
00:36:47,013 --> 00:36:51,013
And they burned Zachariah alive.

661
00:36:51,013 --> 00:36:55,046
And as the flames melted the flesh from his body,

662
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,913
Zachariah didn't scream.

663
00:36:57,913 --> 00:37:00,946
He just smiled at those watching.

664
00:37:00,946 --> 00:37:04,847
And he made a solemn vow

665
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:08,580
That whenever someone does evil in these woods,

666
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:12,247
If you call Zachariah's name three times

667
00:37:12,247 --> 00:37:14,247
And mark the ground with a "z,"

668
00:37:14,247 --> 00:37:19,480
- Then he will rise from the grave and he will take them.  - Yeah, right.

669
00:37:22,613 --> 00:37:25,380
And if the sinner doesn't confess his sins,

670
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:29,047
If he doesn't repent, then Zachariah will drag them down

671
00:37:29,047 --> 00:37:30,546
Into his ghastly lair,

672
00:37:30,546 --> 00:37:34,547
To suffer with him in black darkness

673
00:37:34,547 --> 00:37:37,181
For all eternity.

674
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:38,880
That's it?

675
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,000
Yes, that's it.

676
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,780
That was weak, dude.

677
00:37:45,347 --> 00:37:49,314
Well, it's only weak if the curse isn't true.

678
00:37:49,314 --> 00:37:54,580
And we all know that evil has been done in these woods.

679
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:59,914
But is there anyone here willing to call Zachariah's name?

680
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,313
Anyone?

681
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,613
Zachariah!

682
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,580
Zachariah!

683
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:16,580
Zachariah!

684
00:38:21,047 --> 00:38:24,047
Told you. Weak.

685
00:38:24,047 --> 00:38:28,580
You forgot the most important part.

686
00:38:31,413 --> 00:38:36,447
You have to mark the ground with a "z."

687
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,647
Guess he's on vacation.

688
00:39:03,413 --> 00:39:05,914
- Elliott, was it you?  - Aah! Aah!

689
00:39:05,914 --> 00:39:08,413
Did you kill Justin?

690
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,413
- Elliott, this is your last chance.  - Aah!

691
00:39:11,413 --> 00:39:14,914
- Did you kill Justin?  - Yes! Yes, it was me!

692
00:39:16,947 --> 00:39:20,814
Saved. That was close.

693
00:39:24,914 --> 00:39:28,213
- Oh, hey, Rigsby.  - Hey.

694
00:39:30,747 --> 00:39:33,280
I... I... I knew it was a joke.

695
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,213
I... I was just kidding.

696
00:39:35,213 --> 00:39:37,847
No, you're a liar and a murderer, Elliot.

697
00:39:37,847 --> 00:39:41,514
Everyone can see that.

698
00:39:41,514 --> 00:39:43,580
Whoa, whoa, whoa, a little help here.

699
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:47,681
Give it up, kid. Come on. It's over.

700
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,314
Justin was an insect.

701
00:39:52,314 --> 00:39:54,114
He shouldn't have interfered.

702
00:39:54,114 --> 00:39:56,747
Yes. You had a sweet little system going.

703
00:39:56,747 --> 00:40:00,047
You kept the kids in line with messages from Zachariah,

704
00:40:00,047 --> 00:40:02,813
And you kept Maclean in line with blackmail.

705
00:40:02,813 --> 00:40:05,080
Protect Elliot and let the Z crew rule,

706
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,613
Or be exposed as a habitual rapist.

707
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:10,647
- You're a very clever young man.  - Yes, I am.

708
00:40:10,647 --> 00:40:15,014
That's why my parents abandoned me in this dump.

709
00:40:15,947 --> 00:40:18,047
I'm too clever for them.

710
00:40:18,047 --> 00:40:19,713
And for you.

711
00:40:19,713 --> 00:40:22,180
You haven't really caught me.

712
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,713
I'm a minor. Nothing bad will happen to me.

713
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:27,314
Then why don't you tell us why you killed Justin?

714
00:40:27,314 --> 00:40:28,613
For the record.

715
00:40:28,613 --> 00:40:31,347
You know why.

716
00:40:31,347 --> 00:40:34,446
Justin was always soft on Cassie.

717
00:40:34,446 --> 00:40:36,480
But when he found out

718
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,880
What she was doing with maclean on my order...

719
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,880
He got angry, threatened to ruin everything.

720
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:47,180
And I tried to shut him up with a message from Zachariah.

721
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:49,347
He wouldn't back off.

722
00:40:49,347 --> 00:40:52,313
He laughed at me. 

723
00:40:54,214 --> 00:40:57,613
He shouldn't have done that. 

724
00:40:59,147 --> 00:41:03,780
I don't like being laughed at.

725
00:41:05,314 --> 00:41:08,980
Well, good-bye, Elliot. 

726
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:12,114
H...hey.

727
00:41:13,347 --> 00:41:17,181
How did you know it was me?

728
00:41:19,013 --> 00:41:21,614
When Cassie brought Maclean tea in a cup with z's on it,

729
00:41:21,614 --> 00:41:23,814
That was a warning from you to keep his mouth shut.

730
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:26,047
You were the first to bring forth the Zachariah story,

731
00:41:26,047 --> 00:41:28,347
And you've been at this school longer than anyone else,

732
00:41:28,347 --> 00:41:30,047
With no desire to leave.

733
00:41:30,047 --> 00:41:32,214
The sacred fire ceremony confirmed my hunch.

734
00:41:32,214 --> 00:41:35,313
Everybody else was scared that I was invoking Zachariah,

735
00:41:35,313 --> 00:41:37,980
But you... you were contemptuous and cynical.

736
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:41,847
A true artist watching a cheap imitator...

737
00:41:41,847 --> 00:41:44,847
Until fear made you a believer.

738
00:41:44,847 --> 00:41:48,080
It can do that to you.

739
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,280
Bye.

740
00:41:51,847 --> 00:41:55,413
Sit down.

741
00:41:55,413 --> 00:41:58,080
I appreciate everything that you've done.

742
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,814
It's our job.

743
00:42:00,814 --> 00:42:03,380
Thank yo yeah.

744
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:06,714
Oh, there he is.

745
00:42:06,714 --> 00:42:09,880
Uh, here I am.

746
00:42:10,747 --> 00:42:14,847
I was just telling Mr. and Mrs. Prentiss

747
00:42:14,847 --> 00:42:17,213
It was you that found their son's killer.

748
00:42:17,213 --> 00:42:19,981
Yes, uh, I'm very sorry for your loss.

749
00:42:19,981 --> 00:42:21,881
Thank you.

750
00:42:21,881 --> 00:42:23,413
Thank you so much.

751
00:42:23,413 --> 00:42:26,647
We're very grateful.

752
00:42:26,647 --> 00:42:31,414
It gives us some kind of closure at least.

753
00:42:35,013 --> 00:42:38,347
Your son died bravely.

754
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:40,413
He saved a young girl in trouble.

755
00:42:40,413 --> 00:42:43,781
You should be very proud?????«??????????????????????????????????????????
