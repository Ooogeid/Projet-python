1
00:00:05,516 --> 00:00:06,888
Heads again.
That's 18.

2
00:00:11,868 --> 00:00:12,968
Heads again.

3
00:00:14,223 --> 00:00:15,132
19.

4
00:00:19,532 --> 00:00:20,441
And...

5
00:00:24,857 --> 00:00:25,586
<i>Voilà</i>

6
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,642
- I believe that's the wager.
- Pay up.

7
00:00:30,866 --> 00:00:32,907
- What's the trick?
- Trick?

8
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:35,951
Tell me what the trick is,
and I will give you the money.

9
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:38,382
The trick is...

10
00:00:39,884 --> 00:00:41,207
I've supernatural powers.

11
00:00:42,931 --> 00:00:44,460
It's a 2-headed coin, right?

12
00:00:46,328 --> 00:00:47,254
Looks normal.

13
00:00:49,777 --> 00:00:51,688
You did something
to the coin, right?

14
00:00:52,698 --> 00:00:54,616
Come on, man.
I gave you 20 bucks.

15
00:00:59,494 --> 00:01:01,268
- Can I help you?
- Am I in the way?

16
00:01:01,393 --> 00:01:03,187
- Kimball said I could sit here.
- Kimball?

17
00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:05,731
I'm a friend of his.
Elise Chay.

18
00:01:06,417 --> 00:01:07,467
Elise, yes.

19
00:01:07,823 --> 00:01:09,273
I'm Theresa Lisbon.

20
00:01:09,907 --> 00:01:11,153
Cho's talked about you.

21
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:12,568
It's nice to meet you.

22
00:01:13,066 --> 00:01:16,030
- You must be Rigsby.
- Wayne.

23
00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:18,298
- It's a pleasure.
- It is.

24
00:01:18,423 --> 00:01:19,996
I like putting faces to names.

25
00:01:20,501 --> 00:01:22,081
I have to ask you...

26
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,619
- Patrick Jane is...
- Over here.

27
00:01:25,506 --> 00:01:26,210
Hi.

28
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:31,156
- I thought he'd look scarier.
- He's resting.

29
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,261
I was just meeting them.

30
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:37,463
We were getting
to the embarrassing questions.

31
00:01:37,588 --> 00:01:40,016
And that's why we're leaving.
Our reservation's at 8:00.

32
00:01:41,097 --> 00:01:43,477
- It was nice meeting you all.
- Have a good night.

33
00:01:45,944 --> 00:01:48,482
- Let me just get this.
- I'll be by the elevator.

34
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:52,236
<i>- Agent Kimball Cho?
- That's right.</i>

35
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:54,561
It's Detective Sharon Florey,
Oakland homicide.

36
00:01:54,686 --> 00:01:56,999
I caught a shooting on the east side.
Can you help me?

37
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,287
For CBI's assistance, you'll have
to run it by the agent in charge.

38
00:02:01,535 --> 00:02:04,457
No, I'm not asking for CBI,
agent, just you.

39
00:02:05,112 --> 00:02:05,833
Why?

40
00:02:07,578 --> 00:02:09,100
<i>We haven't ID'd the victim yet,</i>

41
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:12,888
but we got his phone.
There were three calls to your number.

42
00:02:13,371 --> 00:02:15,171
<i>That bring a name to mind?</i>

43
00:02:17,057 --> 00:02:18,471
What's the victim look like?

44
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,972
Asian male, early 30s,

45
00:02:20,648 --> 00:02:23,403
<i>Prison tats.
Gangbanger, probably.</i>

46
00:02:28,393 --> 00:02:29,843
What's the address?

47
00:02:30,831 --> 00:02:32,731
<i>1300 Summit Street, Oakland.</i>

48
00:02:36,908 --> 00:02:38,509
<i>- I'm on my way.
- Thanks.</i>

49
00:02:41,444 --> 00:02:42,411
Duty calls?

50
00:02:43,278 --> 00:02:45,802
It's a homicide in Oakland.
They want help with the ID.

51
00:02:46,054 --> 00:02:49,206
You're gonna disappoint
that lovely young lady, for a corpse?

52
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,003
In Oakland?

53
00:02:51,545 --> 00:02:52,745
A job's a job.

54
00:02:56,117 --> 00:02:57,134
I come with you.

55
00:02:58,936 --> 00:03:00,054
I'll do this alone.

56
00:03:25,198 --> 00:03:26,247
Detective Florey.

57
00:03:26,755 --> 00:03:28,499
Victim took 3 bullets in the back.

58
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:31,043
Wallet's missing,
but I don't think it was a robbery.

59
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,962
He still had his phone and some cash

60
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,457
in his back pocket.

61
00:03:34,582 --> 00:03:35,582
Also this.

62
00:03:36,606 --> 00:03:38,156
Mean anything to you?

63
00:03:51,774 --> 00:03:53,187
His name's David Seung,

64
00:03:54,154 --> 00:03:56,389
got out six months ago
after doing time at Folsom.

65
00:03:56,699 --> 00:03:57,653
He's a banger,

66
00:03:58,192 --> 00:03:59,905
member of the Avon Park Playboys.

67
00:04:00,355 --> 00:04:01,699
Avon Park Playboys?

68
00:04:03,168 --> 00:04:05,369
- My old gang.
- You ran with the Playboys?

69
00:04:08,664 --> 00:04:10,810
Seung's only family
is his grandmother,

70
00:04:10,935 --> 00:04:13,794
- She lives on Telegraph Avenue.
- What he'd been up

71
00:04:13,971 --> 00:04:15,546
- to since getting out?
- No idea.

72
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,423
Haven't talked to him in 13 years.

73
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:19,550
What about those calls?

74
00:04:20,347 --> 00:04:22,428
He left a couple messages,
said he needed help.

75
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:24,430
You find out why?

76
00:04:25,714 --> 00:04:26,724
Anything else?

77
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,351
We're good.

78
00:04:30,394 --> 00:04:31,812
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

79
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,300
- What's the story?
- You heard the story.

80
00:04:38,425 --> 00:04:40,139
Why did he call you for help?

81
00:04:40,264 --> 00:04:42,814
- Are you friends?
- We used to be best friends.

82
00:04:43,111 --> 00:04:44,366
He was like my brother.

83
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,956
<i>2x14
Blood in, Blood out</i>

84
00:04:55,864 --> 00:04:57,508


85
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,019
Morning.

86
00:05:13,118 --> 00:05:14,661
Does that look funny to you?

87
00:05:15,332 --> 00:05:16,479
Like, thicker?

88
00:05:18,311 --> 00:05:19,220
Why?

89
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,118
I'm thinking Jane
weighted it on one side,

90
00:05:22,243 --> 00:05:23,614
so that it always lands heads.

91
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,070
Except when I flip it,

92
00:05:26,777 --> 00:05:28,369
it doesn't always land heads.

93
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:30,037
It comes up tails half the time.

94
00:05:31,212 --> 00:05:33,159
Maybe there's a technique
of tossing it.

95
00:05:34,872 --> 00:05:36,460
Not getting enough sex
from Van Pelt.

96
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:39,546
- We don't talk about that.
- Kimball.

97
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:42,716
Mrs. Seung.

98
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,806
It's so good to see you
after all these years.

99
00:05:49,303 --> 00:05:50,557
What can I do for you?

100
00:05:51,264 --> 00:05:53,954
You never visited him
in prison, did you?

101
00:05:56,124 --> 00:05:57,074
12 years,

102
00:05:57,862 --> 00:05:59,112
is a long time.

103
00:06:00,367 --> 00:06:02,055
I told David about you,

104
00:06:02,906 --> 00:06:04,656
when you joined the army,

105
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,290
when you became a police officer.

106
00:06:07,687 --> 00:06:09,757
He always looked up to you.

107
00:06:11,415 --> 00:06:15,040
You'll be working to find
who killed him, won't you?

108
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,295
No, ma'am.

109
00:06:16,665 --> 00:06:18,335
The case belongs
to the Oakland police.

110
00:06:18,605 --> 00:06:20,120
They'll find whoever did this.

111
00:06:20,245 --> 00:06:21,886
That Detective woman,

112
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:24,865
She thinks he got killed
because he was in the gang.

113
00:06:25,124 --> 00:06:26,218
That's not true.

114
00:06:26,603 --> 00:06:28,463
It does look like
that's what happened.

115
00:06:29,447 --> 00:06:30,797
He left the gang.

116
00:06:31,445 --> 00:06:32,595
He had a job.

117
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:35,936
He told you he left the gang
but doesn't mean he did.

118
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,688
He wouldn't lie to me.

119
00:06:39,818 --> 00:06:41,218
When I knew David,

120
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:44,476
I heard him lie to you many times,

121
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:46,947
About what he was doing,
who he was with.

122
00:06:49,301 --> 00:06:51,201
The Oakland police
will handle it, okay?

123
00:06:52,344 --> 00:06:53,644
Please, Kimball.

124
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,372
Won't you help?

125
00:06:57,811 --> 00:06:59,239
I'm sorry, Mrs. Seung.

126
00:07:00,744 --> 00:07:01,879
I can do nothing.

127
00:07:08,006 --> 00:07:09,094
He was a friend?

128
00:07:10,617 --> 00:07:12,023
It was a guy I used to know.

129
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,547
We'll cover for you
if you want to handle it.

130
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,641
- Boss won't mind.
- I'm not getting involved.

131
00:07:18,584 --> 00:07:19,730
He was your friend.

132
00:07:21,828 --> 00:07:23,942
He was a gangbanger.
Bangers get shot.

133
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:27,613
Not the first guy I knew to get shot.
He won't be the last.

134
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:28,816
That's funny.

135
00:07:29,443 --> 00:07:31,200
Grandma seemed pretty certain he was

136
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:32,660
no longer a gang member.

137
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,191
- She's wrong.
- She seemed pretty sharp.

138
00:07:35,905 --> 00:07:37,956
Maybe he got shot
'cause he was trying to stop.

139
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:39,625
That happens, doesn't it?

140
00:07:40,116 --> 00:07:41,782
Whatever. Oakland's got it.

141
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:44,963
How much time

142
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,332
is Oakland PD gonna spend
on a gangbanger?

143
00:07:47,591 --> 00:07:49,176
Not much.
What's your point?

144
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:53,382
There must be someone that can tell us
that he was or wasn't in the gang.

145
00:07:53,635 --> 00:07:54,807
Just for kicks.

146
00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:03,993
Okay, then...

147
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:05,389
Just to...

148
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,986
soothe your troubled conscience.

149
00:08:22,098 --> 00:08:23,591
So the mean streets, huh?

150
00:08:24,777 --> 00:08:27,626
- Your old stomping ground.
- You could say that.

151
00:08:30,012 --> 00:08:32,089
Stole a car over there
when I was 14.

152
00:08:33,532 --> 00:08:35,132
Crashed it over there.

153
00:08:38,531 --> 00:08:40,182
- Don't wander.
- No worries.

154
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:43,856
We're closed.

155
00:08:45,656 --> 00:08:46,483
Jon Jon.

156
00:08:52,417 --> 00:08:53,699
Is that you for real?

157
00:08:55,453 --> 00:08:57,040
I heard you was a cop.

158
00:08:57,479 --> 00:08:58,954
I said, no way.

159
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:02,082
Dawg, this is Kimball Cho.

160
00:09:02,894 --> 00:09:03,917
I see him.

161
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:06,904
He's a Playboy from way back.

162
00:09:07,812 --> 00:09:09,173
Called him the "Ice man."

163
00:09:11,923 --> 00:09:14,636
You wanted something done cold,
you got Cho.

164
00:09:15,051 --> 00:09:16,513
It's still the same.

165
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:17,931
Who are you?

166
00:09:21,145 --> 00:09:22,436
Nice to meet you.

167
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:23,568
Great store.

168
00:09:23,755 --> 00:09:26,481
Some kind of drug dealership
is it, yeah?

169
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,426
I read somewhere that...

170
00:09:30,551 --> 00:09:33,433
And this is very interesting.
The average drug dealer

171
00:09:33,743 --> 00:09:36,491
would make a better wage
serving burgers.

172
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,536
Is that accurate?

173
00:09:41,049 --> 00:09:43,373
There's chumps and there's players
in any game, bro.

174
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:44,950
I guess.

175
00:09:49,296 --> 00:09:50,672
You hear about David Seung?

176
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:54,927
Any idea who killed him?

177
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,266
Was he rolling with you guys?
Is that what got him in trouble?

178
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,018
Why would I tell you anything?

179
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:05,354
I want to confirm it's a gang beef,
and I'll go.

180
00:10:06,515 --> 00:10:08,109
When David got out of prison,

181
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:10,150
we asked him to put in some work,

182
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,933
get him back in the groove.
He said no.

183
00:10:13,806 --> 00:10:15,556
He was quitting. He quit.

184
00:10:16,121 --> 00:10:18,278
About a month ago,
he calls and he's all,

185
00:10:18,403 --> 00:10:19,993
"I need to talk to K.S. direct."

186
00:10:20,368 --> 00:10:22,120
Like he had some kind of deal.

187
00:10:22,467 --> 00:10:24,957
So he's working with K.S.
and not the gang?

188
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:26,567
That's wrong.

189
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:28,293
Disrespect.

190
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:30,501
You're in or you're out.

191
00:10:31,272 --> 00:10:32,622
Ain't no halfway.

192
00:10:33,977 --> 00:10:35,342
Right, Ice man?

193
00:10:36,046 --> 00:10:37,135
What kind of deal?

194
00:10:37,683 --> 00:10:38,733
Don't know.

195
00:10:40,691 --> 00:10:43,972
I do know K.S. is seriously mad
at you for what you did.

196
00:10:44,743 --> 00:10:46,543
He should learn to let go.

197
00:10:47,073 --> 00:10:48,021
Thanks.

198
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:53,568
These numbers mean anything to you?

199
00:10:57,547 --> 00:10:58,365
Certain?

200
00:11:02,775 --> 00:11:04,121
You're absolutely certain?

201
00:11:05,376 --> 00:11:06,665
What's with this guy?

202
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,225
All right, we're going.

203
00:11:10,684 --> 00:11:13,338
Your obsession with eating
is an infantile attempt

204
00:11:13,655 --> 00:11:16,008
of coping
with the persistent anxiety you feel.

205
00:11:16,398 --> 00:11:18,548
Now if I may recommend something?

206
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:22,420
A career change.
It'll be very good for you.

207
00:11:26,711 --> 00:11:28,694
Don't take this the wrong way,
who came up

208
00:11:28,819 --> 00:11:32,024
with "Avon Park Playboys"?
It's not very tough.

209
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,859
That's funny.
Let's go.

210
00:11:35,004 --> 00:11:35,913
Ice man,

211
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,697
I know where it comes from,
but I just...

212
00:11:38,938 --> 00:11:42,118
Tell me you didn't come up with that,
you can do better.

213
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:45,290
<i>- What you got?
- When David Seung got out of prison,</i>

214
00:11:45,415 --> 00:11:48,540
he went to work
for a janitorial company in Oakland.

215
00:11:49,044 --> 00:11:50,584
Rigsby found where David worked.

216
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:52,669
- Lisbon know?
- Got an address?

217
00:11:53,227 --> 00:11:54,627
I'm working on it.

218
00:11:55,023 --> 00:11:58,116
<i>- What about Seung's girlfriend?
- Gimme a hint on the coin trick.</i>

219
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,344
<i>- Occam's razor.
- What razor?</i>

220
00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:01,678
Bye.

221
00:12:02,433 --> 00:12:04,798
Let's go pay a visit
to David's old boss.

222
00:12:04,923 --> 00:12:06,975
- He was a banger.
- So he had it coming?

223
00:12:09,008 --> 00:12:11,313
Let's go and see his boss,
get a second opinion.

224
00:12:12,325 --> 00:12:15,317
- And who's this "K.S.," by the way?
- He's a gang leader, bad guy.

225
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:18,278
- What'd you do to make him mad?
- I shot him.

226
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:21,698
That'll do it.

227
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,268
I saw David last night.

228
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:25,984
I was dropping off payroll
when he was starting his shift.

229
00:12:26,109 --> 00:12:28,120
Did he ever mention
the Avon Park Playboys?

230
00:12:28,462 --> 00:12:31,124
His P.O. got him the interview.
I knew about his past.

231
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:32,434
Why'd you hire him?

232
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:34,184
I don't mind hiring ex-cons.

233
00:12:34,409 --> 00:12:37,112
They need a second chance.
When they get one, they appreciate it.

234
00:12:37,237 --> 00:12:38,924
They're loyal.
It keeps turnover down.

235
00:12:39,805 --> 00:12:40,736
Hey, you.

236
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,637
- Can I help you, Mr. Reed?
- Yeah, do your job.

237
00:12:44,036 --> 00:12:47,223
The third floor men's room's a disaster.
Whole floor's starting to stink.

238
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:48,687
Middle management.

239
00:12:50,689 --> 00:12:51,520
Excuse me?

240
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,296
You catch more flies with honey.

241
00:12:56,421 --> 00:12:58,173
It's a sound business principle,

242
00:12:58,298 --> 00:13:00,711
Obviously, one you never learned.

243
00:13:00,836 --> 00:13:03,250
Hence, middle management.

244
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,570
Have a nice day.

245
00:13:08,731 --> 00:13:09,731
He's gone.

246
00:13:10,377 --> 00:13:11,750
I started this business

247
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,223
thinking it'd be nice
not to have a boss.

248
00:13:14,478 --> 00:13:17,587
- Truth is, I have dozens.
- Do you know what these mean?

249
00:13:20,562 --> 00:13:21,624
I have no idea.

250
00:13:23,008 --> 00:13:23,969
Not at all?

251
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,434
I don't know what else to tell you.

252
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,310
- No need.
- Thanks.

253
00:13:32,607 --> 00:13:34,184
No problem. Good luck.

254
00:13:38,441 --> 00:13:41,388
I got a call from
Detective Florey with Oakland homicide.

255
00:13:41,513 --> 00:13:44,858
Did we decide to take over David Seung's
case and nobody bothered to tell me?

256
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:47,810
Because she's hearing from witnesses
that you've talked to.

257
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,463
We're just pursuing
a little independent investigation.

258
00:13:51,862 --> 00:13:53,677
- We don't do those.
- That's my bad.

259
00:13:53,802 --> 00:13:55,459
Checking if David was a Playboys.

260
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:57,650
Ballistics connected the gun
used to kill him

261
00:13:57,775 --> 00:13:59,912
with another gang shooting
a year ago.

262
00:14:00,037 --> 00:14:01,537
It was the Playboys.

263
00:14:02,156 --> 00:14:03,065
Great.

264
00:14:08,644 --> 00:14:10,599
Maybe we should go see
this K.S. character?

265
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:16,646
Or not.

266
00:14:19,952 --> 00:14:21,197
So I told the professor

267
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:23,377
that the evidentiary issues
were secondary

268
00:14:23,502 --> 00:14:25,154
to the procedural question.

269
00:14:26,138 --> 00:14:27,959
And she looked at me and said,

270
00:14:28,084 --> 00:14:29,954
"Hey, your hair's on fire."

271
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:33,038
Hello?

272
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:35,874
Sorry. I heard that.

273
00:14:36,521 --> 00:14:38,793
Hearing isn't the same as listening.

274
00:14:39,491 --> 00:14:40,590
Are you okay?

275
00:14:42,805 --> 00:14:43,759
I'm fine.

276
00:14:44,321 --> 00:14:47,049
Kimball, you're talking
even less than you normally do.

277
00:14:48,932 --> 00:14:50,249
What's on your mind?

278
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:52,187
Nothing.

279
00:14:53,912 --> 00:14:56,662
You just don't want
to talk about it, right?

280
00:14:58,466 --> 00:14:59,231
Right.

281
00:15:02,213 --> 00:15:03,437
We don't have to talk.

282
00:15:07,863 --> 00:15:08,772
Thanks.

283
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:13,370
On the floor!

284
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:15,831
Take it easy!

285
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:17,666
Get down! Face down!

286
00:15:18,056 --> 00:15:20,460
- You stay away from her!
- Stay out of Playboy business!

287
00:15:28,692 --> 00:15:30,181


288
00:15:35,908 --> 00:15:38,562
She's got some pretty bad bruising
but she'll be okay.

289
00:15:40,596 --> 00:15:42,554
You'll be fine.
Just hang in there.

290
00:15:42,978 --> 00:15:44,328
It hurts to talk.

291
00:15:45,868 --> 00:15:47,018
Are you okay?

292
00:15:47,818 --> 00:15:49,249
Are you coming with me?

293
00:15:50,684 --> 00:15:54,111
I have some things
to take care of first, okay?

294
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:06,811
We're taking over this case.
We'll liaise with the Oakland PD,

295
00:16:06,936 --> 00:16:09,753
But we're in charge. I'll look
into suspects with the Playboys.

296
00:16:09,888 --> 00:16:12,590
Rigsby and Van Pelt will talk
to the people at Seung's work.

297
00:16:12,715 --> 00:16:16,387
He was shot two blocks away from work.
Maybe somebody saw something.

298
00:16:32,206 --> 00:16:33,456
Where we going?

299
00:16:35,511 --> 00:16:36,817
Why did you shoot K.S.?

300
00:16:37,476 --> 00:16:40,998
It's a gang. There's gotta be some kind
of rules against that sort of thing.

301
00:16:42,081 --> 00:16:43,710
K.S. wanted to do a home invasion.

302
00:16:44,644 --> 00:16:47,535
You go in, hold the family hostage
and take all their cash.

303
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,010
I wouldn't do it.

304
00:16:49,987 --> 00:16:51,954
K.S. wanted me on the job.
We argued.

305
00:16:52,215 --> 00:16:53,928
He pulled his gun.
I pulled mine faster,

306
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,946
tagged him in the shoulder.

307
00:16:56,071 --> 00:16:57,705
That's when I left the gang.

308
00:16:58,287 --> 00:17:00,505
Gave my gun to David.
A couple of days later,

309
00:17:00,868 --> 00:17:02,101
he boosted a car.

310
00:17:02,226 --> 00:17:04,475
They pulled him over,
found the gun on him.

311
00:17:05,501 --> 00:17:07,653
With the possession charge,
he got 15 years.

312
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:09,792
You felt responsible
because it was your gun.

313
00:17:09,917 --> 00:17:12,672
No, I thought he's stupid to have it.
Never should've done that.

314
00:17:12,797 --> 00:17:15,241
- Then you joined the army?
- Enlisted two weeks later.

315
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:18,552
I wanted to get as far away as I could.
Told myself I'd never go back.

316
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,850
How's business?

317
00:17:31,396 --> 00:17:32,567
Jon Jon's gone.

318
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,845
- You want to talk, find him.
- Where's K.S.?

319
00:17:36,135 --> 00:17:37,055
Where's K.S.?

320
00:17:38,181 --> 00:17:39,975
Simple enough question, I thought.

321
00:17:41,678 --> 00:17:44,187
- Were you serious?
- I need to talk to him. Where is he?

322
00:17:44,776 --> 00:17:45,980
I don't talk to cops.

323
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,858
I'm not a cop tonight. No badge.
Now where is he?

324
00:17:49,844 --> 00:17:51,903
I'm not leaving until I get
an answer from you.

325
00:17:54,259 --> 00:17:55,913
I ask you one more time
where K.S. is.

326
00:17:56,038 --> 00:17:58,364
You don't tell me, I break your arm.
You understand me?

327
00:17:58,489 --> 00:18:00,785
- Screw you, man.
- Let's just reconsider...

328
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,692
I can do this all day.
Where's K.S.?!

329
00:18:02,817 --> 00:18:05,667
Okay, man. You're gonna
break my arm. All right.

330
00:18:10,395 --> 00:18:11,897
Where are Jane and Cho?

331
00:18:12,022 --> 00:18:14,472
I can't get them on the phone,
they won't respond.

332
00:18:14,597 --> 00:18:16,469
I don't know.
Cho wasn't to the hospital.

333
00:18:16,859 --> 00:18:17,768
Damn.

334
00:18:18,269 --> 00:18:21,526
I went over the list of people working
with Seung the night he was killed.

335
00:18:21,933 --> 00:18:23,847
Four of them
work at the same job site.

336
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,361
A financial firm called
Cedar Creek Wquities.

337
00:18:26,486 --> 00:18:28,231
That's where Jane
and Cho went to, right?

338
00:18:29,086 --> 00:18:30,970
Go and talk to whoever's in charge.

339
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:33,486
Set up interviews with anyone
who worked with Seung.

340
00:18:34,077 --> 00:18:36,114
And if you hear
from either of them, call me.

341
00:18:40,091 --> 00:18:41,956
- What did he call it?
- Occam's razor.

342
00:18:42,394 --> 00:18:44,247
- What is it?
- It's some logic thing.

343
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:47,380
It says you should avoid complexity,
when solving problems.

344
00:18:47,505 --> 00:18:49,476
What's the link
with flipping heads 20 times?

345
00:18:49,601 --> 00:18:50,851
I have no idea.

346
00:18:51,752 --> 00:18:52,702
Hi.

347
00:18:52,827 --> 00:18:55,592
Agent Van Pelt and Rigsby from CBI.

348
00:18:56,487 --> 00:18:57,719
Something happen?

349
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:02,682
We need to speak with the director
of operations, Adam Reed.

350
00:19:02,972 --> 00:19:03,911
Is he in?

351
00:19:04,036 --> 00:19:06,747
Not right now.
Would you like to leave a message?

352
00:19:06,872 --> 00:19:08,772
We need to talk to him.
Is he in the building?

353
00:19:09,841 --> 00:19:10,750
Sure.

354
00:19:11,714 --> 00:19:14,417
But he could be anywhere,
And I don't know when he'll be back.

355
00:19:14,542 --> 00:19:16,571
You could call him
and ask him to come back?

356
00:19:18,135 --> 00:19:20,049
Right.
I guess I could do that.

357
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:22,619
Bad cold?

358
00:19:24,388 --> 00:19:26,915
It's allergies. They drive me crazy.

359
00:19:35,192 --> 00:19:36,549
That's K.S.'s house?

360
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,369
I'm going in.
You stay here, don't move.

361
00:19:39,751 --> 00:19:41,329
I'm not going anywhere.

362
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:57,112
We're looking into the murder
of one of your employees, D. Seung.

363
00:19:58,686 --> 00:19:59,906
That was shocking.

364
00:20:00,256 --> 00:20:03,219
I saw him
around the office occasionally,

365
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:06,131
And we didn't have
any real interaction.

366
00:20:06,579 --> 00:20:07,497
I don't,

367
00:20:08,465 --> 00:20:11,543
hang out in the men's room.
Checking out the paper products.

368
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:34,691
You ever see any arguments
between Seung and coworkers?

369
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:36,109
Not with staff.

370
00:20:36,787 --> 00:20:38,570
Cleaning crew?
You'd have to ask them.

371
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:40,324
And where could we find them?

372
00:20:40,487 --> 00:20:41,499
Downstairs.

373
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:45,243
My girl Crystal can help you out.

374
00:20:50,615 --> 00:20:53,571
Could you please take
these agents downstairs

375
00:20:53,834 --> 00:20:55,837
and let 'em talk
to all the janitors?

376
00:20:56,694 --> 00:20:58,200
- Sure.
- And on your way back up,

377
00:20:58,325 --> 00:20:59,966
Get me a decent cup of coffee.

378
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:03,579
Thank you.
Thanks for your time.

379
00:21:03,704 --> 00:21:04,704
You bet.

380
00:21:06,162 --> 00:21:07,071
Thanks.

381
00:21:24,923 --> 00:21:27,285
Nobody move.
Hands where I can see them.

382
00:21:31,982 --> 00:21:32,832
Cho.

383
00:21:33,239 --> 00:21:34,042
K.S.

384
00:21:35,882 --> 00:21:38,671
- It's been a while.
- What are you doing here, man?

385
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,965
- We need to talk.
- Got nothing to say to you.

386
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,301
I'm not asking you.
In there. Move.

387
00:21:50,908 --> 00:21:51,817
Go on.

388
00:21:57,289 --> 00:22:00,059
I'll shoot anyone
who comes through that door.

389
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:02,762
What is this?

390
00:22:05,174 --> 00:22:07,367
- Did you kill David Seung?
- Who?

391
00:22:12,767 --> 00:22:15,041
Good to see you, too, bro.
Haven't changed much.

392
00:22:17,817 --> 00:22:20,261
Someone came to my house,
hurt my girlfriend,

393
00:22:20,614 --> 00:22:22,458
told me to stay out
of Playboy business.

394
00:22:22,782 --> 00:22:25,176
- That's good advice.
- You still mad I shot you?

395
00:22:26,123 --> 00:22:27,036
Not mad.

396
00:22:28,734 --> 00:22:31,192
- Determined.
- I'll shoot you again if you want.

397
00:22:31,317 --> 00:22:32,976
Telling me what I want to know.

398
00:22:33,503 --> 00:22:35,453
You're not going to shoot me.

399
00:22:36,803 --> 00:22:37,730
Try me.

400
00:22:38,884 --> 00:22:41,659
You're a cop.
You'll do what the man says.

401
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,102
I'll do what needs to be done.
You know that.

402
00:22:49,444 --> 00:22:51,909
I didn't put the beat down
on your girlfriend.

403
00:22:52,863 --> 00:22:54,363
I didn't kill David.

404
00:22:57,071 --> 00:22:58,932
David came to me a month ago,

405
00:22:59,057 --> 00:23:01,383
wanted to buy some coke, 5 large.

406
00:23:02,059 --> 00:23:03,464
I hooked him up. That's all.

407
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:07,035
- What were you arguing about?
- That much weight wasn't just for him.

408
00:23:07,483 --> 00:23:09,804
- I figured he was selling.
- You told him to cut you in.

409
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:14,642
But he wasn't down for that.
Said it was a onetime thing and no more.

410
00:23:14,962 --> 00:23:17,145
You're lying.
I'm taking you in.

411
00:23:18,326 --> 00:23:19,235
Get up.

412
00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:22,483
- Not going to a good place.
- Shut up.

413
00:23:22,971 --> 00:23:24,121
Get the door.

414
00:23:29,494 --> 00:23:30,403
Move.

415
00:23:36,718 --> 00:23:37,627
Hi.

416
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,168
You must be K.S.

417
00:23:43,201 --> 00:23:44,663
Very nice to meet you.

418
00:23:45,397 --> 00:23:46,257


419
00:23:50,774 --> 00:23:51,596
Let him go.

420
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:55,016
- Drop your gun and I'll let him go.
- No way. You.

421
00:23:56,426 --> 00:23:58,126
What's it gonna be, Cho?

422
00:23:58,604 --> 00:23:59,704
It's on you.

423
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:06,361
Let's just take a breath,
think about what we want.

424
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:11,991
- You don't really want to shoot me.
- No?

425
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,063
My friend and I are cops.

426
00:24:15,646 --> 00:24:17,430
No matter how crazy
and tough you are,

427
00:24:17,555 --> 00:24:20,238
everyone knows what happens
when you kill a cop.

428
00:24:21,386 --> 00:24:23,336
If you're lucky,
it will be lifelong jail.

429
00:24:24,358 --> 00:24:25,549
If you're lucky.

430
00:24:32,043 --> 00:24:33,596
You don't want to shoot K.S.

431
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,345
You do, you'll never know
if he killed David.

432
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:38,320
You'll destroy your career.

433
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:43,737
So let's just embrace this moment,

434
00:24:43,862 --> 00:24:44,962
and think...

435
00:24:46,188 --> 00:24:47,610
about what we want.

436
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:51,114
And just relax.

437
00:24:57,886 --> 00:24:58,795
Just...

438
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:02,334
Loosen up and relax.

439
00:25:05,901 --> 00:25:07,703
That feels so much better.

440
00:25:10,344 --> 00:25:11,253
Get out.

441
00:25:12,841 --> 00:25:13,750
Now.

442
00:25:16,482 --> 00:25:17,482
Thank you.

443
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:22,270
Actually, I...

444
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:26,249
It's okay...

445
00:25:28,302 --> 00:25:29,353
Don't shoot.

446
00:25:30,411 --> 00:25:32,292
Just a plastic bag.

447
00:25:33,888 --> 00:25:35,032
Nothing to it.

448
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:37,910
These numbers,
they mean anything to you?

449
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:45,146
You are one strange freak, man.

450
00:25:47,872 --> 00:25:49,822
Okay. I'll take that as a no.

451
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,863
We should arrest K.S. and bring him in.
There's plenty to hold him on.

452
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:58,622
He'd come in surrounded by lawyers.

453
00:25:58,747 --> 00:26:00,866
It's not his first time
in an interrogation room.

454
00:26:00,991 --> 00:26:03,811
- Besides, I think he's clean for this.
- Clean? How?

455
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,980
He told you
that he sold the drugs to David.

456
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:07,523
Why would he do that?

457
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,400
Why would he kill him?
What's the motive?

458
00:26:09,876 --> 00:26:10,864
That looks good.

459
00:26:10,989 --> 00:26:13,154
- Lighter than air.
- Why'd you call him?

460
00:26:15,135 --> 00:26:16,574
You're an unreliable partner.

461
00:26:17,577 --> 00:26:18,784
I nearly got shot.

462
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,489
If David was selling, he was using.

463
00:26:20,614 --> 00:26:23,080
So, he could have
screwed up with K.S. a thousand ways.

464
00:26:23,312 --> 00:26:26,792
Seung wasn't using, his tox screen
came back clean. No drugs.

465
00:26:28,358 --> 00:26:29,170
See?

466
00:26:30,067 --> 00:26:33,417
- K.S. killed him for another reason.
- Too complicated.

467
00:26:33,684 --> 00:26:35,098
Occam's razor says

468
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:37,887
the simplest solution to a problem

469
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:39,799
is usually the correct one. Right?

470
00:26:39,924 --> 00:26:42,519
- Right.
- Right. So if I flip a coin,

471
00:26:42,644 --> 00:26:44,602
and I get heads 20 times in a row,

472
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:47,291
I could have rigged the coin.

473
00:26:47,416 --> 00:26:50,166
But if the simple answer
is the right one...

474
00:26:50,698 --> 00:26:51,609
Two coins.

475
00:26:52,139 --> 00:26:53,569
A 2-headed version

476
00:26:54,234 --> 00:26:55,234
to flip...

477
00:26:57,062 --> 00:26:58,312
And a real coin

478
00:26:58,615 --> 00:27:00,117
<i>to show you, my friend.</i>

479
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:03,400
- I knew it.
- What's that got to do with David?

480
00:27:04,334 --> 00:27:06,467
David bought $5,000
worth of cocaine.

481
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:09,070
He didn't sell and he wasn't using.
Think simple.

482
00:27:09,195 --> 00:27:10,595
Who got the drugs?

483
00:27:43,686 --> 00:27:44,786
Hi, Crystal.

484
00:27:46,046 --> 00:27:47,206
What you got there?

485
00:27:49,928 --> 00:27:51,419
<i>Where did you get the drugs.</i>

486
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:54,237
Crystal,
this is a homicide investigation.

487
00:27:54,602 --> 00:27:55,590
Give us a name.

488
00:27:56,783 --> 00:27:58,233
Was it David Seung?

489
00:28:02,854 --> 00:28:04,554
Yes, it was David Seung.

490
00:28:05,233 --> 00:28:06,851
He gave me the drugs.

491
00:28:07,048 --> 00:28:08,853
No, you jumped at that
a little too eagerly.

492
00:28:09,246 --> 00:28:11,439
<i>It's not a good idea to lie to us.</i>

493
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,386
I can't tell.

494
00:28:19,389 --> 00:28:20,656
He'll hurt me.

495
00:28:22,299 --> 00:28:23,784
Has he hurt you before?

496
00:28:26,848 --> 00:28:27,663
How?

497
00:28:32,207 --> 00:28:33,851
He likes to get high

498
00:28:35,179 --> 00:28:37,506
And beat me and then have sex.

499
00:28:39,339 --> 00:28:41,135
Crystal, that's sexual assault.

500
00:28:41,462 --> 00:28:42,803
He somebody you work with?

501
00:28:45,077 --> 00:28:47,933
Crystal, if you tell us his name,
he won't hurt you again.

502
00:28:55,791 --> 00:28:56,942
Adam Reed.

503
00:29:01,598 --> 00:29:04,408
And did Adam get the drugs
from David Seung?

504
00:29:08,849 --> 00:29:09,663
How?

505
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,042
<i>Adam caught David stealing a laptop,</i>

506
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,550
<i>and he knew</i>

507
00:29:14,894 --> 00:29:17,174
<i>that David had gang connections.</i>

508
00:29:17,399 --> 00:29:18,547
<i>So he figured</i>

509
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:21,995
<i>he would know people
who had access to good coke.</i>

510
00:29:22,248 --> 00:29:23,052
<i>Adam</i>

511
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,847
<i>told David he would turn him in
unless he got us the drugs.</i>

512
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,935
Adam Reed blackmailed David
into giving him the drugs?

513
00:29:38,056 --> 00:29:38,984
Thank you.

514
00:29:40,188 --> 00:29:42,538
That was lovely.
Thank you, Crystal.

515
00:29:43,251 --> 00:29:44,657
Do you know what these mean?

516
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,372
Where...
How'd you get those?

517
00:30:14,285 --> 00:30:15,729
One for me.
One for you.

518
00:30:19,122 --> 00:30:20,272
Two for me...

519
00:30:25,572 --> 00:30:28,367
Lady, if you don't want to go to jail,
leave now.

520
00:30:32,253 --> 00:30:33,747
What's going on, fellas?

521
00:30:34,243 --> 00:30:36,841
What the hell is this?
That's not mine.

522
00:30:36,966 --> 00:30:39,274
She brought that in here.
It has nothing to do with me.

523
00:30:43,986 --> 00:30:45,759
- Sit down.
- I don't care about that.

524
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:49,007
You're a true renaissance man,
aren't you?

525
00:30:49,337 --> 00:30:52,183
Businessman, drug dealer,
blackmailer, sex abuser.

526
00:30:53,123 --> 00:30:54,738
You talkin' to Crystal?

527
00:30:55,749 --> 00:30:56,937
The crazy cokehead?

528
00:30:57,799 --> 00:30:59,273
You can't believe her.

529
00:31:00,974 --> 00:31:02,026
Don't mess with us.

530
00:31:04,514 --> 00:31:06,280
Then there's the shooting
of D. Seung.

531
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,463
- I had nothing to do with that.
- We think you did.

532
00:31:09,687 --> 00:31:12,012
You know what these are?
'cause I do.

533
00:31:12,137 --> 00:31:14,586
These are passwords
to financial accounts

534
00:31:14,711 --> 00:31:16,582
of some of the firm's
wealthiest clients.

535
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:21,170
<i>David Seung was stealing these
when he was killed.</i>

536
00:31:22,516 --> 00:31:24,131
The drug buy,
that was just a warm-up.

537
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,550
This is what you really wanted him
to do, wasn't it?

538
00:31:26,904 --> 00:31:29,929
You wanted him to steal these numbers
so that you could sell them.

539
00:31:30,212 --> 00:31:32,139
But something went wrong,
and you shot him.

540
00:31:32,783 --> 00:31:34,767
You're insane.
I had nothing to do with that!

541
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:35,935
You did.

542
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,751
Then you broke into my house
and you beat on my girlfriend

543
00:31:38,876 --> 00:31:40,648
and threw the blame on K.S.

544
00:31:40,915 --> 00:31:42,233
No. I didn't.

545
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:53,452
- Where's the gun, Adam?
- What gun?

546
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:56,455
The gun you used to kill David.

547
00:31:56,738 --> 00:31:59,834
That's crazy, man.
I want my lawyer right now.

548
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:04,004
You gotta take it down a notch.
We can take him back to the office.

549
00:32:05,897 --> 00:32:07,293
We need him to confess.

550
00:32:07,418 --> 00:32:10,106
He has to tell us where the gun is.
Otherwise, he's gonna walk.

551
00:32:10,231 --> 00:32:11,929
- We'll get there.
- It'll be fine.

552
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:14,848
You got cuts on your knuckles.
You get those when you hit somebody.

553
00:32:15,913 --> 00:32:19,182
You went to my girlfriend's apartment.
You punched her until she bled.

554
00:32:19,591 --> 00:32:21,146
And you killed my friend David.

555
00:32:21,821 --> 00:32:22,821
Admit it.

556
00:32:23,031 --> 00:32:25,126
- That's from something else.
- Admit it!

557
00:32:25,251 --> 00:32:27,801
I did!
I bought drugs from David Seung.

558
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,488
I admit that.

559
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:30,656
So?

560
00:32:30,898 --> 00:32:32,783
The rest, I don't know.

561
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,051
Last chance.

562
00:32:34,989 --> 00:32:37,496
You killed David and you hide the gun.
Where?

563
00:32:37,821 --> 00:32:38,747
I don't know.

564
00:32:39,766 --> 00:32:40,666
Too bad.

565
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,411
- Where are we gonna go?
- Come on!

566
00:32:59,536 --> 00:33:01,523
- Where are you taking me?
- Come on.

567
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:03,439
Open up!

568
00:33:08,665 --> 00:33:10,615
Come on, man.
Open the door!

569
00:33:15,503 --> 00:33:16,503
Hello?!

570
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:19,986
- Open the door!
- Cho!

571
00:33:22,253 --> 00:33:23,334
Somebody!

572
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:26,810
Open up.

573
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,088
Open it up!

574
00:33:31,412 --> 00:33:33,344
Thank you.
Do you know which way they went?

575
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,294
- They went that way.
- Left or right?

576
00:33:35,557 --> 00:33:37,598
- Left. That way.
- Thank you!

577
00:33:43,034 --> 00:33:45,186
You should use this
as a learning experience.

578
00:33:45,311 --> 00:33:46,023
What?

579
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:52,947
Please don't.

580
00:34:06,877 --> 00:34:08,337
Come on!
Quick!

581
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:10,297
Key! You got a key?

582
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:12,370
Quick.

583
00:34:17,428 --> 00:34:18,428
Crap!

584
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:20,650
Hell. Cho!

585
00:34:21,196 --> 00:34:22,101
Is he dead?

586
00:34:22,924 --> 00:34:24,144
Yes. He wouldn't talk.

587
00:34:25,339 --> 00:34:26,730
This is not good, Cho.

588
00:34:27,003 --> 00:34:28,494
You're out of control.

589
00:34:28,726 --> 00:34:29,992
He made me mad.

590
00:34:30,279 --> 00:34:32,820
Stay right where you are.
Rigsby, put the body in the car.

591
00:34:34,677 --> 00:34:36,851
- Put the body in the car!
- Right. Fine.

592
00:34:38,055 --> 00:34:39,055
Listen.

593
00:34:40,009 --> 00:34:41,453
I won't tell to anybody.

594
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,902
- Be quiet! I'm thinking!
- What's to think about?

595
00:34:44,027 --> 00:34:46,503
He didn't confess.
If he was guilty, he would have talked.

596
00:34:47,166 --> 00:34:48,168
I guess.

597
00:34:48,562 --> 00:34:50,220
What do you think, Frank?

598
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,263
I don't know anything about it.

599
00:34:59,127 --> 00:35:00,127
Really?

600
00:35:01,073 --> 00:35:02,092
That's odd,

601
00:35:02,856 --> 00:35:03,856
'cause...

602
00:35:04,092 --> 00:35:06,478
I think you lied
about knowing these numbers.

603
00:35:06,812 --> 00:35:07,938
You're wrong.

604
00:35:08,718 --> 00:35:11,135
Cleaning the bathroom,
picking up the trash...

605
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,694
It must feel pretty good
getting rich off their accounts.

606
00:35:14,587 --> 00:35:16,959
- I didn't do that.
- What's with the gloves, Frank?

607
00:35:19,504 --> 00:35:21,004
They're work gloves.

608
00:35:22,288 --> 00:35:24,531
You're not working now.
Take them off. Go on.

609
00:35:25,551 --> 00:35:27,916
Is there some reason
you won't take them off?

610
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,583
You got cuts and bruises on them?

611
00:35:29,708 --> 00:35:32,113
Slow down.
This doesn't have to end the same way.

612
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:34,798
Tell us.
Tell us the truth.

613
00:35:35,932 --> 00:35:37,509
I don't understand.

614
00:35:40,258 --> 00:35:42,389
- You shot David Seung.
- No, I didn't!

615
00:35:42,873 --> 00:35:45,559
You said you were dropping off
the payroll this night.

616
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:46,973
You lied to us.

617
00:35:47,207 --> 00:35:49,938
You saw what happened to him.
I am trying to help you.

618
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,690
- Show me your hands.
- No.

619
00:35:52,206 --> 00:35:54,108
So Jane's right.
It was you.

620
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:59,948
Don't make me kill you, too.
Tell me the truth.

621
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:02,318
You tell me the truth,
and I won't hurt you.

622
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,204
I'm not...

623
00:36:05,971 --> 00:36:07,853
Stop! I confess!
I killed David!

624
00:36:08,472 --> 00:36:10,042
Don't let him shoot me!

625
00:36:10,386 --> 00:36:12,069
- The truth.
- He'll deny it later.

626
00:36:12,851 --> 00:36:14,980
I broke into
your girlfriend's apartment!

627
00:36:15,105 --> 00:36:16,890
I cuffed you!
I made you watch!

628
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:19,610
Look. See?

629
00:36:21,331 --> 00:36:22,304
See my hands?

630
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:26,433
- Where's the gun?
- In the storm drain out front.

631
00:36:26,839 --> 00:36:28,589
It's okay. I believe him.

632
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:40,572
Wait.

633
00:36:42,524 --> 00:36:43,774
You killed him.

634
00:36:57,295 --> 00:36:58,632
He's confessed.
You won.

635
00:36:59,028 --> 00:37:00,822
You won.
You don't have to hurt him.

636
00:37:00,947 --> 00:37:02,797
You don't have to hurt him.

637
00:37:04,316 --> 00:37:06,235
- You're right.
- It's okay.

638
00:37:24,633 --> 00:37:26,906
We found the gun.
Ballistics are a match.

639
00:37:27,031 --> 00:37:30,117
You didn't hire David to give him
a second chance. But for steal for you.

640
00:37:30,242 --> 00:37:31,540
He was lifting laptops

641
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:32,708
and data.

642
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:35,878
All you had to do was threaten
to violate his parole.

643
00:37:36,377 --> 00:37:37,377
Why kill him?

644
00:37:37,634 --> 00:37:38,922
He was stealing for you.

645
00:37:39,829 --> 00:37:41,300
He said he was gonna quit.

646
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:44,320
He didn't want any of it.

647
00:37:45,181 --> 00:37:46,930
Said he just wanted
to live his life.

648
00:37:48,947 --> 00:37:50,475
<i>I thought he'll see the cops.</i>

649
00:38:02,293 --> 00:38:04,890
The other gunman, who is he?

650
00:38:07,542 --> 00:38:08,542
Tony Wade.

651
00:38:10,952 --> 00:38:12,252
He works for me.

652
00:38:16,722 --> 00:38:18,045
We're done here.

653
00:38:21,036 --> 00:38:22,236
Come on Frank.

654
00:38:41,293 --> 00:38:44,488
I apologize for accusing you.
I knew you had not committed

655
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:46,168
And for assaulting you

656
00:38:46,707 --> 00:38:47,783
repeatedly.

657
00:38:48,339 --> 00:38:49,368
That's it?

658
00:38:51,243 --> 00:38:53,246
Yes. I thought that was very good.

659
00:38:55,851 --> 00:38:58,617
It's incredible.
Absolutely incredible.

660
00:38:59,387 --> 00:39:02,156
This case won't last 30 seconds
in a court. The lawsuits,

661
00:39:02,446 --> 00:39:04,640
however,
will last for a very long time.

662
00:39:04,845 --> 00:39:06,551
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

663
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:08,541
Agent Cho,

664
00:39:09,506 --> 00:39:11,682
you've made my client a rich man.

665
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,268
One more thing.

666
00:39:15,875 --> 00:39:16,770
What's that?

667
00:39:17,246 --> 00:39:20,421
We've testimony from Crystal Hargrave
that will lead to Mr. Reed

668
00:39:20,546 --> 00:39:22,401
being charged with several felonies.

669
00:39:22,946 --> 00:39:25,636
They include narcotics trafficking,
extortion,

670
00:39:25,899 --> 00:39:28,085
- sexual harassment...
- Never be admitted.

671
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:29,616
Fruit of the poisonous tree.

672
00:39:30,327 --> 00:39:32,100
Not even from the same forest.

673
00:39:33,903 --> 00:39:36,081
Our D.A. is willing
to talk a deal with Mr. Reed.

674
00:39:36,361 --> 00:39:38,000
In the interest of mending fences,

675
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:40,627
If he's interested
in mending fences with us.

676
00:39:51,821 --> 00:39:53,932
- We'll speak to the D.A.
- Good.

677
00:40:39,946 --> 00:40:40,996
Mrs. Seung.

678
00:40:43,465 --> 00:40:44,691
May I come in?

679
00:40:50,662 --> 00:40:51,662
Thank you.

680
00:41:04,178 --> 00:41:06,192
When I heard David had been killed,

681
00:41:07,367 --> 00:41:09,674
I assumed it was because
of the mistakes he made,

682
00:41:11,688 --> 00:41:13,720
Because he hadn't changed his ways.

683
00:41:15,193 --> 00:41:16,193
Yes?

684
00:41:17,846 --> 00:41:18,946
I was wrong.

685
00:41:23,108 --> 00:41:24,150
You were right.

686
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,680
David had changed.

687
00:41:32,903 --> 00:41:34,241
David called me...

688
00:41:36,362 --> 00:41:37,708
to ask for my help.

689
00:41:40,682 --> 00:41:42,416
But I never called him back.

690
00:41:49,961 --> 00:41:51,890
When I learned he'd been killed,

691
00:41:54,537 --> 00:41:55,887
I didn't want to admit

692
00:41:56,407 --> 00:41:58,262
that maybe he'd turned
his life around,

693
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,936
Because that would mean
admitting that I let him down.
