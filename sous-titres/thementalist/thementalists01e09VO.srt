Mentalist /'men-t3-list/ noun

2
00:00:04,047 --> 00:00:09,045
Someone who uses mental
acuity, hypnosis and/or suggestion.

3
00:00:09,707 --> 00:00:12,252
A master manipulator of
thoughts and behavior.

4
00:00:12,945 --> 00:00:14,138
Are you ready?

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,217
- Feeling awake, mentally alert?
- Yes.

6
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:19,103
Fantastic. Okay.

7
00:00:19,913 --> 00:00:22,995
I want you to imagine a
screen between you and i.

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,199
On that screen I want you
to project a basic shape

9
00:00:26,324 --> 00:00:27,860
Like a square, but not a square.

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,487
- Got it?
- Okay.

11
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:30,796
Lock it in.

12
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,366
Now I want you to
project another shape

13
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:35,686
And put that shape around
the shape you already have.

14
00:00:37,044 --> 00:00:37,787
Okay.

15
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:40,915
Excellent.
Here's the fun part.

16
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:46,982
Now concentrate and project
that onto the back of my mind.

17
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,047
Look right here.

18
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,467
Open up your mind

19
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,049
And send it to me.

20
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,307
Okay, now I'm starting to feel it.

21
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,215
It's a triangle inside a circle.

22
00:01:02,035 --> 00:01:04,188
- No.
- It's not?

23
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:06,774
No. I was thinking of an
octagon inside a rectangle.

24
00:01:08,282 --> 00:01:09,017
Liar.

25
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,362
All right. All right, you got me.

26
00:01:12,662 --> 00:01:15,199
Pretty good? He got
me and rigsby the same way.

27
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,025
- How did you do that?
- Oh, that's nothing.

28
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,496
That's just a calibration
key to real mind reading.

29
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:23,065
Now I have access to all your
innermost thoughts.

30
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,542
- All right.
- I'm serious.

31
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:27,128
Okay. So what
am I thinking right now?

32
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,635
You're thinking, "i'm so
glad jane is joking around

33
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,413
And he can't actually read my mind."

34
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,894
No...

35
00:01:33,456 --> 00:01:35,265
Well, actually, yes,

36
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:36,945
But... but not for
the reason you think.

37
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,287
What reason do I think?

38
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,266
Never you mind.

39
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:41,450
You're blushing.

40
00:01:42,843 --> 00:01:45,187
- You are blushing.
- Hey, we're up.

41
00:01:45,682 --> 00:01:47,795
Suspected arson/murder
on a farm in marquesa.

42
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,905
The county d. A.'s asking if
we'll check it out.

43
00:01:50,101 --> 00:01:50,943
Let's go.

44
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,112
All right.

45
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,510
Chief piller, why the fire truck?

46
00:02:16,951 --> 00:02:18,311
Shouldn't they be gone by now?

47
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,275
Well, took forever
to put the fire out.

48
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,651
There wasn't enough water pressure

49
00:02:21,776 --> 00:02:24,305
To fill the hoses on
account of the drought.

50
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,610
Rich garcia used to have
the best corn in the county.

51
00:02:28,592 --> 00:02:29,494
Look at it.

52
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,779
Anyway,
this is where we found him...

53
00:02:35,297 --> 00:02:36,850
What was left of him.

54
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,810
There's hardly anything left
for susan and madeleine to bury.

55
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,918
Tough to bury a comrade, I think.

56
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,155
Probably saved your
life more than once.

57
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,371
Vice versa?

58
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,900
How did you know we served together?

59
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,710
You've been crying.

60
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,591
You don't strike me
as the kind of man

61
00:03:00,716 --> 00:03:02,518
That would cry for no reason.

62
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,880
And that's a national
guard signet ring

63
00:03:05,005 --> 00:03:06,407
You're wearing, isn't it?

64
00:03:06,532 --> 00:03:09,485
Yeah, we were in the 3-192 armor.

65
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,600
We did two tours in anbar together.

66
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,155
So you must be the arson specialist.

67
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:19,985
No. The arson specialist...

68
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:23,702
That would be agent rigsby.
Mr. Jane is a consultant.

69
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:27,187
So you... you'll be able to
tell, then, definitively,

70
00:03:27,312 --> 00:03:30,666
Whether the fire was, uh,
arson or accident or whatever?

71
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,254
Two years with the san diego
county arson squad, chief.

72
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:34,693
I'll be able to tell.

73
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:36,765
Chief piller, you and your men

74
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,225
Haven't contaminated
the scene, correct?

75
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,228
My men? It's just me
and terry o'brien, agent.

76
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,750
But yeah, we did like you said.

77
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:45,251
After we hauled rich out,
we haven't set foot in.

78
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,885
So to determine if it's
arson, I'm gonna need

79
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:51,361
To analyze the burn path,
find the point of origin,

80
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,740
Check for signs of an accelerant.

81
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,491
It's arson, all right...

82
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,287
And murder.

83
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:08,970
How can you tell?

84
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,790
This is part of the garage door.

85
00:04:12,422 --> 00:04:13,127
Yes?

86
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:16,160
The lock's on the outside.

87
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,217
Someone locked garcia
in, lit the place up.

88
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,261
Your friend was murdered.

89
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:23,779
I'm sorry.

90
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,685
Don't they usually like to
watch their work, arsonists?

91
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:32,313
Yeah, even more so when
it's coupled with murder.

92
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,825
Maybe this guy's different.

93
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,192
What do you think... Jane?

94
00:04:37,766 --> 00:04:38,485
Jane?

95
00:04:39,811 --> 00:04:40,533
Jane?

96
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,197
Patrick jane?

97
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,074
Over here!

98
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,496
He watched from up here.

99
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,157
He was here.

100
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,182
- What does it look like?
- It's sophisticated work.

101
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:12,245
Electronic timers, mercury switches.
Need the lab on it to be sure,

102
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,765
But looks like they used
a distinctive accelerant...

103
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,942
- Rocket fuel, something like
- So we have a pro at work,

104
00:05:18,317 --> 00:05:19,735
Or a very gifted amateur. Great

105
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,785
And get a cast of the
tire tracks down the road.

106
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,710
You guys go into town
and talk to the guy

107
00:05:24,835 --> 00:05:27,170
Garcia was going to meet that
night... chief, what's his name?

108
00:05:27,295 --> 00:05:29,195
Mitchell Reese. He
works the gas station

109
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,860
- On main street.
- Mitchell Reese. On our way

110
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,793
Let's you and me go in and
talk to the widow. Jane?

111
00:05:55,501 --> 00:05:57,805
These folks are from
The california bureau of investigation.

112
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,985
They're gonna help find
who did this to Rich.

113
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,237
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Thank you for coming.

114
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,742
I... Are you hungry?
There's more than enough.

115
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:12,454
- Oh, i-i could do with a bite.
- No, but thank you, mrs. Garcia.

116
00:06:12,868 --> 00:06:13,694
Guess not.

117
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,745
I, put in some K.P. With the dishes,

118
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,797
And brought in the
firewood, so you're all set.

119
00:06:22,138 --> 00:06:24,425
- Thank you.
- You need anything?

120
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,886
No, Ben, i'm good.
Thank you so much.

121
00:06:28,452 --> 00:06:30,014
These are the state police people.

122
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,830
Oh, hey. Ben Machado.

123
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,353
Anything you need, just
say the word. You got it.

124
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,647
Ben's our, go-to guy in marquesa.

125
00:06:38,983 --> 00:06:41,385
He just means I'm the only
real estate agent around here

126
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,569
Who takes his commission
in fertilizer and chickens.

127
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,620
You were in the 192nd as well?

128
00:06:46,066 --> 00:06:48,866
- That's right.
- You have that military bearing.

129
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:52,275
Rich and Ben and me
and a couple other guys

130
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,785
Ran a platoon together.

131
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,060
Yeah. You guys are
gonna catch the bastard

132
00:06:56,185 --> 00:06:58,959
- Who did this a-sap, right?
- We're certainly gonna try.

133
00:06:59,269 --> 00:07:00,563
I guess that'll have to do.

134
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,440
I'll see you in the morning?

135
00:07:07,342 --> 00:07:08,343
I should go, too.

136
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,115
Ma'am, mind if we ask
you some questions?

137
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,602
No, of course not. Please.

138
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,176
You must be madeleine.

139
00:08:11,301 --> 00:08:13,367
Maddy.
Whatever you're selling... pass.

140
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,755
Funny. What are you, a
moron? My dad just died.

141
00:08:27,238 --> 00:08:27,950
Yes.

142
00:08:28,572 --> 00:08:29,928
My condolences.

143
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:32,193
It happens.

144
00:08:35,154 --> 00:08:36,673
You'll learn to live with it.

145
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:40,301
Not for, a while,

146
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,896
But in the end, you will.

147
00:08:44,313 --> 00:08:45,185
Who are you?

148
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,755
My name's patrick jane. I'm
the man that will find out

149
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,565
Who it was that killed your father

150
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:54,654
And have him or her... or
them... put in a prison cell

151
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:55,995
If you'll talk to me.

152
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,871
If I'll talk to you?
Like I know who did it.

153
00:08:59,177 --> 00:09:00,622
Well, you could help me find out.

154
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,252
Yeah?

155
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:06,745
Your dad was in the national guard
For a long time.

156
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,922
How come there's no pictures
of him with his buddies?

157
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,675
He used to have
all his military crap

158
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,375
In a glass case on the photo wall...

159
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,019
You know, medals and
pictures and stuff.

160
00:09:15,527 --> 00:09:17,920
- But he took it down.
- Why is that?

161
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,465
How should I know? He
didn't like talking about

162
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:23,383
What he did over there... not to me,
anyway.

163
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,346
Who did he talk to, your mom?

164
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:26,982
No.

165
00:09:27,176 --> 00:09:29,610
What do you mean by, " no"?

166
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:34,656
Nothing. I mean, he doesn't
like talking about that stuff.

167
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,886
- Why are you so angry at your mom?
- I'm...

168
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,015
I'm not.

169
00:09:41,537 --> 00:09:43,495
If you weren't angry,
you'd be with her right now.

170
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,918
She needs you.
Her husband just died.

171
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:49,254
Oh, I'm sure she'll
learn to live with it.

172
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,279
I was watching tv.

173
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:54,384
Maddy was in her room.

174
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,565
Richard called to say
he was leaving mitch's,

175
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,085
He'd be home soon.

176
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:01,808
He was doing stuff
for the avocado parade.

177
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,155
And then next thing,

178
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,325
I heard a strange noise,

179
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,400
And I saw

180
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,141
A light out that window.

181
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,364
It was the garage burning,

182
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,724
And rich inside it...

183
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:20,355
Screaming.

184
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:23,076
That's what the noise was...

185
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:24,790
Rich screaming,

186
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:27,626
Trying to get out of the garage.

187
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,095
Hello, mrs. Garcia.

188
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:33,006
I brought corn chips... cool ranch.

189
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,494
Thank you, sweetie.

190
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,968
Would you like some food?

191
00:10:38,464 --> 00:10:39,891
Oh, could I have some chicken?

192
00:10:40,016 --> 00:10:41,977
Of course, anything
you want. Help yourself

193
00:10:46,454 --> 00:10:48,313
Tommy does odd jobs around town.

194
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:53,527
Challenged, but ever so
independent, bless him.

195
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:54,861
"Challenged"?

196
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,614
He's retarded, mom.

197
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,060
Why can't you ever tell
the truth about anything?

198
00:11:00,185 --> 00:11:01,535
Everything's a lie!

199
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,375
Sorry. You know teenagers.

200
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,336
You know why she's so angry?

201
00:11:14,234 --> 00:11:15,815
She suspects that your lover

202
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,121
Is responsible for the
killing of her father.

203
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:21,825
My lover?

204
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,392
How dare you?

205
00:11:25,827 --> 00:11:28,020
- The policeman.
- Chief piller?

206
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,814
- Him.
- Maddy suspects no such thing.

207
00:11:31,794 --> 00:11:33,060
Well, that wasn't very convincing.

208
00:11:33,185 --> 00:11:35,266
You want to try that again
with a little more feeling?

209
00:11:36,306 --> 00:11:37,785
You just cannot come in her

210
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:40,032
And make wild accusations like this.

211
00:11:40,365 --> 00:11:42,034
You never looked
him in the eye once.

212
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:45,035
He kept trying to take your
hand. You wouldn't let him.

213
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,415
The air was practically buzzing
with furtive shame and yearning,

214
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,667
Which tells me that you were lovers

215
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:53,225
And suggests two possibilities...

216
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,815
You and piller killed
your husband together,

217
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,700
- And now you're remorseful...
- No.

218
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,064
No.

219
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,059
I believe you.

220
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,525
You'd have found a more
humane method of killing him.

221
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:09,561
Second possibility... you
have a horrible feeling

222
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,315
That maybe piller did this thing

223
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,106
To clear the field for himself.

224
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:16,610
No. Trey would never.
They were best friends.

225
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:18,795
A best friend that has an affair

226
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,447
With his "best friend's" wife?

227
00:12:22,022 --> 00:12:22,783
Susan...

228
00:12:24,242 --> 00:12:25,869
We'll find out the truth.

229
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,360
When rich came back from the war...

230
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,337
He closed me out.

231
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,840
He went somewhere else.

232
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:41,259
He wasn't my husband anymore.

233
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,514
Did you have an affair
with trey piller?

234
00:12:46,142 --> 00:12:46,864
Yes.

235
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,596
But trey would never hurt rich.

236
00:12:51,467 --> 00:12:52,479
I know that.

237
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:53,897
Well, you hope.

238
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,175
Come on, help us out, mr. Reese.

239
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,671
You might have been the last
person to see rich garcia alive.

240
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:02,989
How about that

241
00:13:04,596 --> 00:13:05,755
What's the problem?

242
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,577
Electrics shot, I bet.

243
00:13:09,307 --> 00:13:11,084
Always the same with the
early'70s models.

244
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,460
Yeah. I gotta get the old pig
runnin'smooth for the parade.

245
00:13:17,176 --> 00:13:19,714
That's what rich and I were
talking about the night he died.

246
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,025
Did you notice anyone else around,

247
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,964
Anyone waiting nearby for him?

248
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,145
What time did he leave?

249
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,557
It was kind of late.
Around 10:00, maybe.

250
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,110
Are you thinkin'this is murder?

251
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,455
Someone cooked him deliberate?

252
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,940
Yes, looks like.

253
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,068
- That's weird.
- Why weird?

254
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:45,705
Another man killed by arson in the
same town from the same guard unit?

255
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:48,076
- That's weird.
- Hang on. Another man?

256
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,474
Didn't chief piller tell you?

257
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,293
Three years ago. A guy
called david martin.

258
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,794
- Burnt to a crisp.
- And he was with the 192nd as well?

259
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,964
Yep. That's what I heard,
anyhow. It was before my time.

260
00:14:01,381 --> 00:14:02,641
Only been in town a year.

261
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,676
David martin lived
up at alton's grove.

262
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,263
Surprised chief piller
didn't mention him.

263
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:13,727
Van pelt.

264
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,779
- This is trey piller's house.
- Fire department's on its way, boss.

265
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,407
- Is chief piller still inside?
- I don't know.

266
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:29,784
Help!

267
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,990
Stop! Rigsby, wait! Idiot!

268
00:14:32,115 --> 00:14:32,970
Rigsby!

269
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:45,957
Oh, my god!

270
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,630
Don't move. Don't move.
Don't move. Don't move.

271
00:14:51,522 --> 00:14:53,683
You'll be all right.
You're gonna be okay.

272
00:14:56,782 --> 00:14:59,285
I'm just gonna lift your arm, okay?
The doctor said we have

273
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:01,150
to change the dressing
pretty often at first.

274
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,442
How's chief piller?

275
00:15:03,217 --> 00:15:05,570
The burn unit in sacramento
says it's touch and go.

276
00:15:10,055 --> 00:15:12,410
Hey. Check out dr. Van pelt.

277
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,332
Here. It's that mango crap you like.

278
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,512
How are you feeling?

279
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:23,046
Took some kick-ass painkillers, man.

280
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,175
I guess this lets piller
out as a suspect?

281
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,623
Yeah, especially since the
doctors at the burn unit

282
00:15:29,748 --> 00:15:31,350
Found date rape drugs in his system.

283
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,140
He told them that he woke up

284
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:36,746
- With smoke and fire all around him.
- Interesting new level of cruelty...

285
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:39,688
Dosing someone so they wake
up just in time to burn alive.

286
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,493
Hey, it's the mummy.

287
00:15:46,102 --> 00:15:49,565
So the fire at piller's house same m. O.
As the one that killed rich garcia.

288
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,765
Accelerant's ethyl
ether. That's a signature.

289
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:54,202
Tricky stuff to work with,
too. Takes skill, finesse.

290
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,225
Why don't you go and
see what susan garcia

291
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:59,005
Has to say about all this?
And let's you and me check out

292
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:02,010
This alton's grove place
where david martin died.

293
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:05,857
Oh, "the mummy." I get it. Bandages.

294
00:16:06,274 --> 00:16:08,174
And no more painkillers for him.

295
00:16:13,951 --> 00:16:15,716
Why didn't you tell us about
dave martin?

296
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,017
What about him?

297
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,375
Same national guard
unit, same death by fire.

298
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,995
- That's a pretty spooky coincidence.
- But dave's death was an accident,

299
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,983
And nearly three years ago, besides.

300
00:16:25,404 --> 00:16:26,289
An accident?

301
00:16:26,489 --> 00:16:28,236
Passed out
with a cigarette, poor fool.

302
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,080
Burned his place
right down to a cinder.

303
00:16:31,205 --> 00:16:33,628
There wasn't a thing left of him.
We had to bury ashes.

304
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,363
Are there any...
Are there any other connections

305
00:16:44,488 --> 00:16:46,385
Between this dave
martin and your husband?

306
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,625
Dave was kind of in
business with them...

307
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,300
With rich and trey and ben.

308
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,179
What kind of business?

309
00:16:52,304 --> 00:16:54,804
Mar verde real
estate corporation, they called it.

310
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:58,224
It started out as just a way to
get dave martin a place to live.

311
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:01,519
"No man left behind"
and all, even dave.

312
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,854
He had problems?

313
00:17:03,204 --> 00:17:05,482
He was an ornery drunk, basically.

314
00:17:06,113 --> 00:17:08,650
Didn't get along with
anyone but his guard buddies.

315
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,986
They got together and
bought a 5-acre piece of land

316
00:17:11,111 --> 00:17:12,905
From the town up at alton's grove.

317
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,905
And after he died, what
happened to the land

318
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:18,850
Oh, it took forever to get
the land back into their names.

319
00:17:18,975 --> 00:17:20,402
Legal silliness.

320
00:17:21,049 --> 00:17:22,965
I told rich, "don't waste your time.

321
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:24,501
Land's worth nothing anyhow."

322
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:27,671
Tommy odds lives up there
now, kind of a caretaker.

323
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,965
And as of now, ben machado's
the only partner still standing.

324
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,480
I guess that's right.

325
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,312
Interesting.

326
00:17:37,053 --> 00:17:38,848
Give me a call after
you speak to machado.

327
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,530
We have an audience.

328
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:52,702
Hey, tommy.

329
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,656
Remember Teresa lisbon?

330
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:57,826
Come in.

331
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,444
So, Tommy...

332
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,470
We are here because...

333
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,984
Mrs. Garcia told my colleague

334
00:18:12,109 --> 00:18:14,074
That you look after this place
for the owners?

335
00:18:14,199 --> 00:18:15,475
I keep an eye out.

336
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,850
That's what mr. Garcia said...
"keep an eye out, tommy."

337
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,400
Is that david martin?

338
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,014
Dave was nice.

339
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,695
He didn't make fun
of me, not one time.

340
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:29,607
- You don't smoke cigarettes, do you?
- No.

341
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,361
Oh, good. Dave did, and he
got burned up on accident.

342
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,448
Did you see it?

343
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:38,658
No, I was at the hospital,
'cause my appendix busted.

344
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,095
You want to see my scar?

345
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:44,164
No. No, but I'm sure
mr. Jane would love to.

346
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:45,840
Jane?

347
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,770
Jane?

348
00:19:19,924 --> 00:19:21,701
All this green in
the middle of a drought?

349
00:19:22,052 --> 00:19:23,369
Not at alton's grove.

350
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,955
Do you like it?
I got geraniums, too.

351
00:19:26,851 --> 00:19:27,869
It's very pretty.

352
00:19:28,328 --> 00:19:29,445
But don't tell, okay?

353
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:31,170
The... the company
will make me move out.

354
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,893
I won't have nowhere to live.

355
00:19:34,305 --> 00:19:36,295
It seems like it's
coming from the ground.

356
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,551
It's an aquifer... new
source of groundwater

357
00:19:38,923 --> 00:19:40,970
- Must be worth millions.
- Worth killing for.

358
00:19:48,956 --> 00:19:49,932
Van pelt?

359
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,699
Yes?

360
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,720
"Grace"...
It's a lovely name.

361
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,689
Graceful.

362
00:20:00,431 --> 00:20:03,952
I've been wanting to say
something to you for ages now.

363
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,879
I think now's a good time,

364
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,582
'cause... I nearly died.

365
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:15,307
I love you, grace.
I totally love you. Wh...

366
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:17,757
You okay?

367
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,051
Yes.

368
00:20:20,371 --> 00:20:21,731
Why did you make that noise?

369
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,809
It's not that I don't like you.

370
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:29,354
I do.

371
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:32,199
It's just... We work together,

372
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,530
And there are rules.

373
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,848
And if... We were to get together,

374
00:20:39,507 --> 00:20:41,055
One of us would have
to leave the unit,

375
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:44,097
And I'm junior agent,
so that would be me.

376
00:20:44,222 --> 00:20:47,201
And this job is so important
to me, and I just...

377
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,335
Hey. You want to go to work,

378
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,220
Or you want to play
nurse for king tut?

379
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:03,052
Work. Definitely work.

380
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,402
Mr. Machado?

381
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:12,404
Hello?

382
00:21:13,067 --> 00:21:15,862
Maybe he's around back.
Let's check out the barn.

383
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,867
- I guess we found machado.
- Yeah. Mr. Machado! Ben machado!

384
00:21:29,717 --> 00:21:31,725
Come any closer, and I'll shoot you,

385
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,475
And I will shoot to kill!

386
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,126
Mr. Machado, we're police!

387
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,921
- This is the police!
- Let me see a badge!

388
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:39,923
I'm showing the badge. Don't shoot!

389
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:42,973
Damn!

390
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,637
Okay. Don't shoot!

391
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,194
Turn around.

392
00:21:54,457 --> 00:21:56,520
I didn't know you guys were cops.

393
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:59,941
What, you thought we were
selling magazine subscriptions?

394
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,727
Hey, check this out...

395
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,928
The accelerant used in the fires.
Six jugs of it in the barn.

396
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:24,667
Ethyl ether.

397
00:22:26,733 --> 00:22:29,053
Burns at 600 degrees fahrenheit.

398
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,790
You know what temp
human skin burns at?

399
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:37,587
250.

400
00:22:38,872 --> 00:22:39,748
I was lucky.

401
00:22:40,457 --> 00:22:41,918
Second-degree burns mostly.

402
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,195
Trey piller's face,
it just came off.

403
00:22:45,025 --> 00:22:47,455
Look, I don't know where
that stuff came from.

404
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,695
Someone's framing me.

405
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,955
Somebody frame you for
shooting at us, mr. Machado?

406
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,775
'cause from where I stood,
sure looked like you.

407
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,110
That was a misunderstanding.
I didn't know who you guys were

408
00:22:55,235 --> 00:22:57,545
- I was defending myself.
- Really? From whom?

409
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:59,985
From someone trying to kill
me, just like they killed rich

410
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,331
And tried to kill trey.

411
00:23:01,456 --> 00:23:03,285
And why would you be next
on someone's to-burn list

412
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:05,133
Because we were all
in business together.

413
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:07,185
And with them gone,
you're the sole proprieto

414
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:09,100
of alton's grove sole
owner of all that water.

415
00:23:09,225 --> 00:23:11,520
Oh, yeah, ben, we
know about the aquifer-

416
00:23:11,645 --> 00:23:13,348
All that money right
under your feet.

417
00:23:14,289 --> 00:23:17,618
But see, that's the perfect motive
For you to burn up Piller and Garcia.

418
00:23:17,743 --> 00:23:20,023
- You.
- I didn't do it, okay?

419
00:23:21,553 --> 00:23:23,214
So you're saying
whoever did fry them

420
00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:25,259
Is going to try to kill you. Now
who is that again?

421
00:23:25,384 --> 00:23:26,301
I don't know.

422
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,455
Ben, I gotta say, I'm skeptical.

423
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,366
Why would anyone want
to see you three dead?

424
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,160
Who benefits from that?

425
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:40,168
- Do you want to know my guess?
- No.

426
00:23:40,704 --> 00:23:41,711
Dave Martin.

427
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:46,902
Dave martin is dead.

428
00:23:47,027 --> 00:23:49,510
Is he? Did you see his
body, after the fire?

429
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:50,970
No, but he's dead.

430
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,205
You seem pretty
sure about that, like you were there.

431
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:56,437
- What are you insinuating?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.

432
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:59,405
I'm saying you three
tried to kill him

433
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:01,064
To get alton's grove for yourselves.

434
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,882
That's a lie.

435
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:07,174
Dave came to you all excited.
He found a liquid fortune...

436
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,900
On property that you bought
for him... practically your land.

437
00:24:11,025 --> 00:24:14,368
Dave owed you. But he didn't
even offer you a taste, did he?

438
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:17,515
- Ungrateful bastard.
- That's ridiculous.

439
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,580
We had no idea what
was there till recently.

440
00:24:19,705 --> 00:24:22,085
You and rich and trey
wanted what dave had,

441
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:25,880
So you set fire to his house,
and you left him there to die.

442
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:29,258
Imagine... imagine
the betrayal he felt,

443
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,135
The helpless rage.

444
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,644
That fire was a tragic accident...

445
00:24:34,712 --> 00:24:36,307
And you have no proof otherwise.

446
00:24:36,993 --> 00:24:39,485
Well, someone out there
doesn't need proof.

447
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:41,174
Someone out there needs revenge...

448
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:44,318
Someone very smart
and very determined.

449
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:47,902
That's why he's terrified
and shooting at cops.

450
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:51,996
Well, you should be terrified.

451
00:24:52,121 --> 00:24:54,408
I hope you burn like a candle,
you miserable son of a bitch.

452
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,287
You can't talk to me
like that. I have rights.

453
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,790
Yes, you do.

454
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:06,045
Well, let this creep go. We
don't have anything on him.

455
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:12,495
Two notes here, we
already have plenty on him.

456
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,495
One armed assault
on cho and van pelt,

457
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,429
and two, a barn full of
fire accelerant.

458
00:25:16,554 --> 00:25:19,425
Well, the assault was self-defense,
and the accelerant was a plant.

459
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:22,215
- Only two?
- Actually, no. Where do you get off

460
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,116
giving orders in the first place?

461
00:25:24,241 --> 00:25:26,753
I say who goes and
who stays, not you.

462
00:25:27,145 --> 00:25:29,193
Well, that's, fiery
but calm. Very good

463
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,485
Why don't you try it with a
more forceful hand gesture,

464
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:34,198
like, "i say who goes
and who stays, not you"?

465
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,585
I'm serious.

466
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:38,065
So am i. If he's in here, how
is the killer gonna get to him?

467
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:40,275
He could be the killer,
and even if he's not,

468
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,880
- We don't want the killer to get him.
- Yes, we do.

469
00:25:43,111 --> 00:25:45,251
Machado is our bait.
He's our tethered goat.

470
00:25:45,697 --> 00:25:47,253
And too bad if the bait gets killed?

471
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:49,315
Well, yes. That's why you use goats

472
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,296
And not babies or virgins, for
that matter.

473
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,882
Machado's not a goat.

474
00:25:54,772 --> 00:25:56,485
Well, you're right.
He's not actually a goat.

475
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:58,681
He's goatish. He deserves
to suffer a little.

476
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:00,389
Nobody deserves murder.

477
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,440
Machado helped burn dave
martin alive out of greed.

478
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,939
Jane, we're officers of the law.

479
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,185
You are. I don't care about the law.

480
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,635
I care about justice,

481
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,950
And justice says machado
deserves to suffer.

482
00:26:13,075 --> 00:26:14,780
That's not justice. It's vengeance.

483
00:26:15,247 --> 00:26:16,440
What's the difference?

484
00:26:17,267 --> 00:26:19,045
What do you
want us to do with machado, boss?

485
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:20,272
Let him go.

486
00:26:20,397 --> 00:26:22,079
Really? Like,
let him go, let him go?

487
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:23,706
Really, like that.

488
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:24,922
Okay.

489
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:28,200
Trying some reverse psychology?

490
00:26:28,576 --> 00:26:29,527
You talk tough.

491
00:26:29,652 --> 00:26:32,039
Maybe it's time you learn
that there's consequences.

492
00:26:32,164 --> 00:26:33,883
If machado gets hurt, it's on you.

493
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,580
Fine with me.

494
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,075
We've never discussed this,

495
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,425
Because I thought it
went without saying,

496
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:47,890
But when I catch red john,

497
00:26:48,015 --> 00:26:50,318
I'm gonna cut him open
and watch him die slowly,

498
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,760
Like he did with my wife and child.

499
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:57,406
And if you have a problem
with that, we should talk.

500
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:01,475
Then let's talk, because
when we catch red john,

501
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,000
We are gonna take him into custody,

502
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:06,045
- And he's gonna be tried in a court of law.
- Not if I'm still breathing.

503
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:07,945
If you try and do violence to him,

504
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,535
I will try and stop you.

505
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:12,830
If you succeed in doing violence to
him, I will arrest you.

506
00:27:12,955 --> 00:27:13,836
I understand.

507
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:15,604
I hope so.

508
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:18,415
Well, I'm glad we talked.
I had no idea

509
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:21,222
You were so bourgeois and
conventional on the issue.

510
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,502
You thinking what I'm thinking?

511
00:27:53,336 --> 00:27:54,053
No.

512
00:27:55,606 --> 00:27:58,085
- How do you know you're not?
- I was thinking how I wish

513
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,448
I could go back in time and have sex

514
00:27:59,573 --> 00:28:01,666
With my eighth grade history
teacher miss huffaker.

515
00:28:01,791 --> 00:28:04,175
- Is that what you were thinking?
- No.

516
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,350
I was thinking mitch
reese, the gas station guy

517
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,617
- Whatever lights your fire, man.
- As a suspect. Think about it.

518
00:28:10,742 --> 00:28:12,857
- Who first told us about dave martin?
- Mitch reese.

519
00:28:13,155 --> 00:28:15,818
Knew all about it, even though
he'd only been here a year.

520
00:28:16,447 --> 00:28:17,153
So?

521
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:20,011
So they never found
dave martin's body,

522
00:28:20,136 --> 00:28:21,700
And now someone is taking revenge

523
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:25,494
- On the people that murdered him.
- Mitch reese is dave martin?

524
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:27,745
The beard, the burn
scars on his arms,

525
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,100
His whole vibe.

526
00:28:31,033 --> 00:28:32,335
Wait, dave martin was bald.

527
00:28:34,327 --> 00:28:35,032
Wig.

528
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,478
I would put money on
it. Let's go talk to him.

529
00:28:37,603 --> 00:28:40,495
- We gotta keep an eye on machado.
- To protect machado from the killer,

530
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,550
And if reese is our guy,
that's what we're doing.

531
00:28:44,534 --> 00:28:46,295
Okay, but I'm calling it in.

532
00:28:55,698 --> 00:28:58,145
Mr. Reese, when exactly
did you come to marquesa?

533
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:01,106
- 18 months ago, give or take.
- And what was it brought you here?

534
00:29:01,231 --> 00:29:03,324
- Why marquesa?
- This place was for sale.

535
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,060
No other reason?

536
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:07,295
You didn't know anyone in town before
you moved here?

537
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,072
Nope. Fresh start.

538
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:39,185
How did you get those
burn scars on your arms?

539
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,195
Engine blew up on me
while I was working on it.

540
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,475
- Why do you ask?
- Just curious. Is that your own hair?

541
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,328
Excuse me?

542
00:29:44,453 --> 00:29:46,255
On your head. Is that
yours, or are you wearing a wig?

543
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,354
No, it's my own hair. What kind of
a question is that?

544
00:29:48,479 --> 00:29:50,188
- Mind if we check?
- Yes, I do... ow!

545
00:29:50,313 --> 00:29:51,482
- Sorry, sir.
- Damn.

546
00:29:52,608 --> 00:29:53,850
Thanks for your time.

547
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,346
Hello, Ben.

548
00:31:02,418 --> 00:31:04,236
You're gonna need a firin'pin.

549
00:31:07,858 --> 00:31:10,409
You stay back or
I will light you up.

550
00:31:11,154 --> 00:31:12,589
Who are you? What do you want?

551
00:31:12,714 --> 00:31:16,105
- You know who I am.
- I have no freakin'idea, man.

552
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:18,417
Sure you do, ben.
You tried to kill me.

553
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:19,759
What?

554
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,714
No... That's impossible.

555
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:27,092
No, it's not. It's me.

556
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:28,857
Dave?

557
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,931
Dave martin?

558
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:36,780
Help! Help!

559
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:40,253
Help! Help!

560
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:47,947
Help!

561
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:49,532
No one can hear you, man.

562
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,372
You're gonna die alone,
screaming in agony,

563
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,814
Like I did.

564
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,535
This can't be happening. Help!

565
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:59,789
Why did you kill me,
ben? We were friends.

566
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,365
You wanted money so bad?
You should've told me.

567
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:05,985
I would've helped you.

568
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,476
I did tell you.

569
00:32:08,473 --> 00:32:10,575
All of us, we begged you,
but you wouldn't listen,

570
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,271
You selfish bastard!

571
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:15,856
We didn't want to kill you!

572
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,165
I'm sorry, okay?

573
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:20,242
I'm sorry!

574
00:32:36,452 --> 00:32:38,575
See how much better that feels?

575
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,833
I forgive you. Can't speak
for dave martin, though.

576
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,130
You son of a bitch.

577
00:32:52,228 --> 00:32:54,471
You don't want to make
things worse for yourself.

578
00:32:56,593 --> 00:32:57,820
Rigsby! Cho!

579
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:00,702
What?

580
00:33:01,492 --> 00:33:03,145
I killed an intruder in my barn.

581
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:05,300
How was I to know it was a cop?

582
00:33:06,438 --> 00:33:08,569
If that's even what you
are. What are you exactly?

583
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:11,405
Rigsby! Cho! They're right outside.

584
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:14,283
Oh, are they?

585
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:17,870
Wait a second. One
thing you're forgetting.

586
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:25,701
Machado!

587
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,710
Ben Machado!

588
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:30,994
That's not...

589
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:33,396
You ready to die?

590
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,970
What the hell's going on?

591
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:43,783
Oh, dear.

592
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:20,976
Rigsby!

593
00:34:21,689 --> 00:34:22,420
Cho!

594
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,813
Jane, you in there?

595
00:34:26,595 --> 00:34:28,148
Oh, crap. Jane!

596
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,387
Jane!

597
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:32,010
Jane! Are you OK?

598
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,660
That was close.

599
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:41,495
- Where were you guys?
- We called in to check out a lead.

600
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:43,060
Lisbon didn't know
you were about to pull

601
00:34:43,185 --> 00:34:44,750
An idiotic stunt. Sorry.

602
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,876
No hard feelings.
Oh, arrest this man

603
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:50,395
- He confessed to killing dave martin.
- Cool.

604
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,720
- Got it all here.
- Turn around. Again.

605
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,855
Yeah, yeah, you could...

606
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,643
Yeah, I'll just...
I'll just wait here.

607
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:06,892
Freeze!

608
00:35:08,688 --> 00:35:10,916
That's good. Got him.

609
00:35:18,219 --> 00:35:19,062
Hello, sir.

610
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:27,833
Tommy, what were you doing at
the machado house last night?

611
00:35:28,522 --> 00:35:30,169
Sir, do you got any soda?

612
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,299
- What kind do you want?
- My super favorite is root beer.

613
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:37,255
Okay, I'll get you some in a minute.

614
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,927
- Do you like root beer?
- No.

615
00:35:40,103 --> 00:35:41,722
Do you like to burn things, tommy?

616
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:44,767
No.

617
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:45,870
No?

618
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:48,025
You sure about that?

619
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:51,815
Am I sure about what?

620
00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:56,856
What were you doing
at the machado house?

621
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:59,702
Watching the barn burn down.

622
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,743
You liked watching it?
Gave you a nice feeling?

623
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,532
No, I was scared. I don't
like fire. Fire hurts.

624
00:36:08,397 --> 00:36:09,557
Do you have root beer?

625
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:12,895
It doesn't make sense. All
the evidence says it's him.

626
00:36:13,283 --> 00:36:15,485
There was ethyl ether
traces all over him.

627
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:18,035
But the arsonist used
an electronic timer

628
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,136
And rocket fuel, and tommy's
wearing velcro sneakers.

629
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:25,625
Call him challenged,
retarded, whatever you want...

630
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,415
There's no way he's capable of this.

631
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:30,187
- What if he had a partner?
- Maybe that's it.

632
00:36:30,891 --> 00:36:33,023
Somebody's manipulating
him. Someone he trusts.

633
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,160
Give me a moment with him.

634
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:41,756
- Do you mind?
- Sure thing.

635
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:44,701
Don't make a mess.

636
00:36:47,419 --> 00:36:48,328
Cop humor.

637
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,014
Not funny.

638
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:54,285
I'm supposed to be finding
out who put you up to this.

639
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:56,925
You see, my friends
think you're an idiot.

640
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:59,800
Everybody says that.
Sometimes they're not nice.

641
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:00,797
Yes.

642
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:05,180
Being a fool gives you a
sort of power, doesn't it?

643
00:37:06,178 --> 00:37:08,267
You're there, and you're not there.

644
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:12,020
It's like having a wizard's
cloak of invisibility.

645
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:15,665
I don't understand
what you're saying, sir,

646
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:17,025
But I like wizards.

647
00:37:17,695 --> 00:37:19,805
The... the other man said
he'd get me a root beer,

648
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:21,334
But he never did.

649
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:23,599
Revenge is a hard road, isn't it?

650
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:28,327
It's like when captain
ahab was chasing moby-dick.

651
00:37:28,577 --> 00:37:31,957
The whale died all right, but
the "peapod" went down, too.

652
00:37:32,398 --> 00:37:34,870
"Pequod." Ahab's
ship is the "pequod."

653
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:36,628
Exactly.

654
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,299
The "pequod."

655
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:41,466
Silly of me.

656
00:37:46,792 --> 00:37:48,223
Here's your copy here.

657
00:37:53,215 --> 00:37:54,479
I must say, I'm impressed.

658
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:58,595
I know english literature professors

659
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,152
That haven't read "moby-dick."

660
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,468
I like whales.

661
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:04,395
They eat squids.

662
00:38:05,772 --> 00:38:07,600
Looking back, I should
have known it was you

663
00:38:07,725 --> 00:38:09,036
The first time I saw you.

664
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:14,365
Only an idiot would
wear a t-shirt like that

665
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:15,761
To a house in mourning...

666
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:20,380
An idiot or a daring killer
with a warped sense of humor.

667
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:24,930
You're going down for this one.

668
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,863
You might as well go
down as your real self.

669
00:38:29,229 --> 00:38:30,945
You have pulled off
something amazing.

670
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:33,477
You should be proud in a way.

671
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,731
That root beer coming?

672
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:40,365
Why don't you just
talk to me, thomas?

673
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:42,191
There's no point in hiding anymore.

674
00:38:44,047 --> 00:38:45,030
I can see you.

675
00:38:56,237 --> 00:38:57,547
What do you want to know?

676
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,245
Hello.

677
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,510
Good to meet you.

678
00:39:05,713 --> 00:39:07,950
I am curious. Are there two of you,

679
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,086
Or is tommy just an
act that you put on?

680
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:13,642
Oh, please. I'm not a mental case.

681
00:39:15,746 --> 00:39:18,647
Tommy's an act... A-a performance.

682
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:20,107
That you never turn off.

683
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,826
He amuses me.

684
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:23,485
He protects me.

685
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,570
When I was 18, I jacked a car

686
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,614
And got caught.

687
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:30,909
But when I pulled the tommy
act, the cops let me go.

688
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:34,204
I've gotten much better
since then, of course.

689
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,453
Good enough to avenge
dave martin's death.

690
00:39:36,761 --> 00:39:38,495
Three months ago, the
company finally got

691
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:40,692
A permit to exploit the aquifer.

692
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,849
All that money.

693
00:39:43,907 --> 00:39:45,134
I put things together,

694
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,101
Realized what they'd done to dave.

695
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,398
Thanks.

696
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,625
I confess, i-i never really
could get to the end of it.

697
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:00,439
- Ahab does die, doesn't he?
- Yes.

698
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,108
But so does the whale.

699
00:40:03,564 --> 00:40:06,445
That's my
point. Revenge doesn't come cheap.

700
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:08,693
Oh, spare me your moralizing.

701
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:10,917
I know what revenge costs.

702
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,676
It's worth the price.

703
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:17,315
David martin had
many flaws, no doubt.

704
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:20,141
But he was my friend. My friend.

705
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:24,155
Those animals, they
deserve what they got.

706
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,755
It was justice.

707
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:29,259
You admit to killing rich garcia
and trying to kill trey piller?

708
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:34,037
I watched them scream
and writhe in agony...

709
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:36,422
And it was beautiful.

710
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:38,393
It was redemptive.

711
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:44,483
You wouldn't understand.

712
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:53,255
Agent cho does the formal
police charging stuff.

713
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,491
We're done.

714
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:59,220
Good luck, thomas.

715
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:01,958
Would you do one thing for me?

716
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,628
You can ask.

717
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,410
Would you tell maddy garcia...

718
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:11,550
I'm sorry for hurting her?

719
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:24,764
Sorry? He's sorry?

720
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,265
You tell him if he
ever gets out of jail,

721
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:29,593
I'm gonna set him on fire and
see how he likes it.

722
00:41:29,718 --> 00:41:30,753
- Maddy.
- I am!

723
00:41:30,878 --> 00:41:33,023
- Your father wasn't...
- And don't you talk about him.

724
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:37,327
- You have no right! No right!
- Your father killed a man

725
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,581
And tommy killed him out
of revenge. You know that.

726
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,615
Revenge is a poison.

727
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:46,086
Revenge is for fools and for madmen.

728
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:47,796
I don't care.

729
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:51,174
Yes, you do.

730
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:55,804
Hey, come here. Come on.

731
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,085
We have to go, but,
could you do me a favor?

732
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:08,952
Could you both do me
a favor? Would you hug?

733
00:42:09,211 --> 00:42:11,400
Just pretend like
you love each other.

734
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,466
Please?

735
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:14,968
That's it.

736
00:42:15,646 --> 00:42:17,868
Just like that. That's good.

737
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,845
Now hold that pose until we leave.
It'll help lisbon and me

738
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:23,790
feel like we've actually
made a difference. Thank you.

739
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:34,515
So?

740
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:35,483
So?

741
00:42:36,071 --> 00:42:37,370
Seems like this whole thing

742
00:42:37,495 --> 00:42:39,468
Changed your mind about vengeance.

743
00:42:39,593 --> 00:42:40,303
Huh?

744
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,976
"Revenge is for fools and madmen."

745
00:42:43,364 --> 00:42:45,008
That was rather good, I thought.

746
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,982
Total nonsense, but
quite good nonetheless.

747
00:42:52,573 --> 00:42:53,570
Shall we?
