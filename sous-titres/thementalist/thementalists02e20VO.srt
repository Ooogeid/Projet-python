1
00:00:04,364 --> 00:00:07,499
(Indistinct conversations)

2
00:00:08,867 --> 00:00:10,201
(Man) Hey, Jerry.

3
00:00:10,235 --> 00:00:12,870
Let's do it.
(Clinking)

4
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:16,055
Thank you, Sadie.
Mm-hmm.

5
00:00:16,175 --> 00:00:17,254
(Water splashing)

6
00:00:17,374 --> 00:00:18,265
(Amplified voice) My friends,

7
00:00:18,712 --> 00:00:21,910
I am so proud and happy
to welcome you

8
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,177
to this celebration
of my son Xander...

9
00:00:24,668 --> 00:00:27,590
the new C.E.O.
of Harrington Media.

10
00:00:27,907 --> 00:00:29,816
(Chuckles)

11
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,293
Where is the little cuss,
anyway?

12
00:00:34,882 --> 00:00:37,333
Late for work already...
not a good sign.
(Laughter)

13
00:00:37,453 --> 00:00:39,095
- Elizabeth, text him, would you?
- You got it.

14
00:00:39,614 --> 00:00:41,561
(Amplified voice)
Um, I am sure my husband

15
00:00:41,596 --> 00:00:43,242
has a very good excuse
for his...

16
00:00:43,362 --> 00:00:45,737
Ah, there you are, Xander.

17
00:00:58,939 --> 00:01:01,041
(Crowd gasping)

18
00:01:01,075 --> 00:01:04,783
(Murmuring)

19
00:01:09,838 --> 00:01:11,297
(Cho) That's what killed
Xander Harrington,

20
00:01:11,417 --> 00:01:13,472
and this is where he was
attacked. Now the blood trail

21
00:01:13,592 --> 00:01:15,508
starts here, right where
the letter opener was found.

22
00:01:16,173 --> 00:01:18,786
- The deputy coroner says it was
a single stab wound to the neck.
- Mm.

23
00:01:18,906 --> 00:01:22,009
Now the blow sends him
backwards. He slams his head,

24
00:01:22,129 --> 00:01:24,859
goes down. He's dazed,
slowly bleeding out

25
00:01:24,893 --> 00:01:27,796
for a good 20 minutes or so,
then somehow gathers himself up

26
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,633
and goes for help. Coroner
couldn't believe he even made it

27
00:01:30,667 --> 00:01:31,392
out to the party.

28
00:01:31,512 --> 00:01:34,219
Party which was for him.
Guy just got a big promotion.

29
00:01:34,339 --> 00:01:36,133
Had a wife and kid.
How sad is that?

30
00:01:36,253 --> 00:01:37,433
Sad. Anything else?

31
00:01:37,553 --> 00:01:39,255
Well, according to
the victim's father, there was

32
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:41,590
a confidential business file on
this desk that's gone missing.

33
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,529
- Nothing else taken.
- What was the file about?

34
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:46,618
Plans for the "Daily Observer"...
newspaper.

35
00:01:47,427 --> 00:01:49,314
Debt restructuring,
cost cutting, layoffs.

36
00:01:49,839 --> 00:01:50,864
Layoffs?

37
00:01:50,984 --> 00:01:52,810
Any "Observer" employees
invited to the party?

38
00:01:54,829 --> 00:01:57,256
So you're reporters
for the, uh, "Observer."

39
00:01:58,636 --> 00:02:00,068
Xander Harrington...
man of the people, huh?

40
00:02:00,785 --> 00:02:03,168
Inviting
the ink-stained wretches.

41
00:02:03,587 --> 00:02:05,032
Xander was a good guy.

42
00:02:05,776 --> 00:02:06,745
Did any of you hear
about the layoffs

43
00:02:06,865 --> 00:02:07,799
that were coming up soon?

44
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,299
(Laughs) Layoffs?
What layoffs?

45
00:02:09,804 --> 00:02:12,360
Well, actually,
there's, uh, quite a long list.

46
00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:16,777
Yeah. It appears that no one
is safe. Must be very scary

47
00:02:16,897 --> 00:02:18,239
in the newspaper business
these days.

48
00:02:19,004 --> 00:02:20,320
That's a very lovely dress.

49
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,347
Great color.

50
00:02:22,127 --> 00:02:24,809
Well, thank you. (Chuckles)
I'm Heather Evans.

51
00:02:24,929 --> 00:02:26,812
- Hello, Heather Evans.
You're very attractive.
- Mm.

52
00:02:26,932 --> 00:02:28,448
It's probably why
your name's not on that list.

53
00:02:28,568 --> 00:02:30,425
Good-looking women live
in a different world.

54
00:02:31,421 --> 00:02:33,428
Excuse me? What's this list
you keep mentioning?

55
00:02:33,548 --> 00:02:34,608
Oh, come on, Heather.

56
00:02:34,728 --> 00:02:35,892
The list
that was in the file

57
00:02:36,012 --> 00:02:37,429
that you took
off Xander Harrington's desk.

58
00:02:37,906 --> 00:02:38,760
Everyone here...

59
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,391
we mention layoffs, and everyone
here reacts except you,

60
00:02:41,511 --> 00:02:43,151
because you have read
the list.

61
00:02:43,555 --> 00:02:44,635
Oh, that's ridiculous.

62
00:02:45,054 --> 00:02:46,838
I didn't go anywhere near
Xander's desk.

63
00:02:47,213 --> 00:02:49,030
Bravo. Very well played,

64
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,918
considering the stress
you must be feeling right now.

65
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:53,001
You know,
I was hoping to dazzle you all

66
00:02:53,121 --> 00:02:56,259
with my uncanny Detective
skills, but you force me...

67
00:02:56,894 --> 00:02:59,195
you force me to just reveal
the humdrum facts

68
00:02:59,315 --> 00:03:01,228
and point out that you have
blood on your shoes, Heather.

69
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,923
(Heather) Wha...

70
00:03:06,204 --> 00:03:08,132
(Lisbon) Could you step out
of your shoe, ma'am?

71
00:03:08,252 --> 00:03:10,129
"Stop the presses"?
That's the phrase, right?

72
00:03:10,249 --> 00:03:12,149
"Stop the presses." Yeah.
Got it.

73
00:03:13,839 --> 00:03:15,023
Always wanted to say that.

76
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,888
Xander Harrington caught you
snooping in his office,

77
00:03:32,008 --> 00:03:33,103
and you killed him.

78
00:03:34,276 --> 00:03:35,500
Now maybe
you didn't mean to do it.

79
00:03:36,078 --> 00:03:38,680
- You were surprised, scared...
- No. I didn't even see him.

80
00:03:40,768 --> 00:03:43,252
It was dark. No lights.

81
00:03:44,162 --> 00:03:45,461
<i>Curtains were drawn.</i>

82
00:03:46,575 --> 00:03:48,184
<i>I went to the desk,</i>

83
00:03:48,611 --> 00:03:49,767
<i>I took the file,</i>

84
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,575
<i>and I ran.</i>

85
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,940
If I'd known he was...

86
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,022
My God,
I would never have...

87
00:04:00,062 --> 00:04:01,646
How'd you know
that there was a list at all?

88
00:04:05,226 --> 00:04:06,685
Someone told you. Who?

89
00:04:07,325 --> 00:04:09,019
A confidential source.

90
00:04:09,376 --> 00:04:11,611
And you'll go to jail
to protect this source?

91
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:19,441
Ed. Edward Harrington...
Xander's brother.

92
00:04:19,561 --> 00:04:21,220
He, um...

93
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:24,174
He said there were gonna be
layoffs on Monday.

94
00:04:25,094 --> 00:04:26,460
<i>I just...</i>
<i>I just wanted to know</i>

95
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,236
<i>whether or not</i>
<i>I still had a job.</i>

96
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,676
- It's a very good job.
- Not anymore, it's not.

97
00:04:34,502 --> 00:04:36,729
<i>(Cho) Tell me exactly what</i>
<i>happened from the beginning.</i>

98
00:04:36,849 --> 00:04:38,771
Ma'am? Is there, uh,

99
00:04:38,891 --> 00:04:40,871
I-is there something specific
that you wanted?

100
00:04:41,543 --> 00:04:44,789
No. No.
Just keeping apprised.

101
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,565
Huh.

102
00:04:47,048 --> 00:04:48,604
Alex Harrington
is the owner

103
00:04:48,724 --> 00:04:50,708
of the seventh largest
media conglomerate in the world.

104
00:04:50,828 --> 00:04:51,805
Yes, ma'am.

105
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:53,398
And you don't want
to disappoint a man

106
00:04:53,518 --> 00:04:56,005
who owns 200 TV stations
and a national newspaper.

107
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:57,204
No, ma'am.

108
00:04:58,367 --> 00:04:59,493
Looks like Heather's cleared.

109
00:04:59,869 --> 00:05:01,922
Timeline puts her at the bar
at the time of the attack.

110
00:05:02,042 --> 00:05:05,086
- That's according to several male
guests who remember her well.
- Figures.

111
00:05:05,206 --> 00:05:08,363
Only leaves 196 party guests
and 42 staff

112
00:05:08,483 --> 00:05:11,300
as potential suspects.
Start with the brother.

113
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,288
Okay.

114
00:05:12,966 --> 00:05:14,453
Take Rigsby.

115
00:05:16,966 --> 00:05:17,920
Problem?

116
00:05:18,642 --> 00:05:19,887
Nope. Not at all.

117
00:05:20,966 --> 00:05:23,348
Ma'am? You're giving my team
assignments?

118
00:05:23,594 --> 00:05:26,585
I know. I'm sorry.
Should've been your call.

119
00:05:27,584 --> 00:05:29,259
I just want to make sure
those two can hack it.

120
00:05:29,982 --> 00:05:31,491
Fair enough.

121
00:05:38,554 --> 00:05:40,223
(Lisbon) The head
of your security said that

122
00:05:40,343 --> 00:05:42,450
the house is fully wired,
but the family asked

123
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,901
the cameras inside be
turned off? Why's that?

124
00:05:45,694 --> 00:05:47,222
(Sighs) I take responsibility
for that.

125
00:05:47,342 --> 00:05:51,135
No, it's my fault. I'm Tara...
Alex's wife. This is Ella.

126
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,220
And I'm the one who had
the cameras disconnected.

127
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,927
- It's my fault.
- It's nobody's fault, dear. Hush.

128
00:05:58,047 --> 00:05:59,304
Why'd you do it?

129
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,566
Cameras and panic rooms
and armed guards...

130
00:06:02,686 --> 00:06:03,955
it's a lot to take.

131
00:06:04,418 --> 00:06:06,750
I hated feeling watched
in my own home.

132
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,312
Seems so silly now.

133
00:06:10,005 --> 00:06:13,181
I'm sorry. How long until you
take that horrible stuff down?

134
00:06:13,628 --> 00:06:15,526
Forensics has promised
to release the crime scene

135
00:06:15,646 --> 00:06:18,076
as soon as possible. I am
so sorry for any inconvenience.

136
00:06:18,766 --> 00:06:19,950
(Ella whimpers)
(Whispers) Excuse me.

137
00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:23,373
Uh, I'm too upset.

138
00:06:23,734 --> 00:06:25,694
Uh, m-m-may I?
Oh. (Chuckles)

139
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,493
Thank you.
(Cooing)

140
00:06:29,218 --> 00:06:31,118
(Laughs)

141
00:06:31,153 --> 00:06:32,657
(Lisbon) So, uh,
you and Xander were close?

142
00:06:32,777 --> 00:06:35,361
He and Sadie were
my only true friends.

143
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:37,537
People seem more interested

144
00:06:37,657 --> 00:06:40,332
in befriending
your money and connections

145
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:43,666
when you're married to
the C.E.O. of Harrington Media.

146
00:06:44,398 --> 00:06:46,937
(Alex) Yes, I suppose
it can be difficult at times.

147
00:06:46,971 --> 00:06:49,481
By the way,
it's <i>former</i> C.E.O.

148
00:06:50,506 --> 00:06:52,875
- Xander forced me out.
- (Lisbon) Really?

149
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:53,857
(Alex) Really.

150
00:06:53,977 --> 00:06:58,465
He convened the board,
secured the necessary votes.

151
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:01,216
Son staged a coup.

152
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,279
Yes.

153
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,319
You have any idea the guts
it takes to pull that off?

154
00:07:06,315 --> 00:07:10,027
Xander proved he could lead.
I've never been prouder of him.

155
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:13,269
Proud of, uh, Eddie, too...
my other son.

156
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,040
(Patrick) Well, of course.

157
00:07:15,329 --> 00:07:18,612
But Xander had
the strength to lead, the guts.

158
00:07:18,997 --> 00:07:20,749
That's important to you,
isn't it... guts?

159
00:07:21,428 --> 00:07:25,480
Of course. Guts, heart.
What else is there?

160
00:07:25,928 --> 00:07:28,770
Spleen, liver, kidneys,
uh, genitalia.

161
00:07:28,805 --> 00:07:30,772
(Chuckling)
Lot of important stuff there.

162
00:07:30,807 --> 00:07:32,936
Are you being flippant
with me?

163
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,479
My son is dead.

164
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,446
Forgive me. I-I was.

165
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,948
Lost myself for a second.
Forgot where I was.

166
00:07:39,982 --> 00:07:41,609
But, you know, that...
that's a very beautiful painting.

167
00:07:42,066 --> 00:07:45,412
- Very nice work, yeah.
- Can I talk to you for a moment?

168
00:07:49,325 --> 00:07:50,817
- (Whispers) Quit that!
- What?

169
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,362
Poking the bigwig.

170
00:07:52,795 --> 00:07:54,105
"Poking the bigwig."

171
00:07:54,467 --> 00:07:56,128
Ah, I like it.
It's got a nice ring to it.

172
00:07:58,075 --> 00:08:01,339
I understand it's a compulsion
you're not fully in control of,

173
00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:02,617
but I wish you would try.

174
00:08:02,737 --> 00:08:05,647
It would make our work
a lot easier if you did... try.

175
00:08:06,239 --> 00:08:07,447
- Did you see that?
- What?

176
00:08:07,567 --> 00:08:09,056
Right outside that window.

177
00:08:09,176 --> 00:08:12,079
There's a pink unicorn.
Amazing!

178
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:13,729
Now you're hallucinating.

179
00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:15,808
No. No, no, look.
It's right outside the window.

180
00:08:16,807 --> 00:08:18,616
Seriously, look.
It's a unicorn!

181
00:08:18,736 --> 00:08:20,204
I want to see!

182
00:08:23,068 --> 00:08:25,011
I don't see a unicorn.
It's right there.

183
00:08:25,045 --> 00:08:26,514
(Whispers)
I'm trying to trick her.

184
00:08:26,634 --> 00:08:28,902
Oh. Yes.
Yeah.

185
00:08:29,022 --> 00:08:30,718
What a nice unicorn.

186
00:08:30,838 --> 00:08:32,464
(Normal voice)
Yeah, very nice unicorn.

187
00:08:32,584 --> 00:08:34,130
So you like to have
secret tea parties?

188
00:08:34,835 --> 00:08:36,510
How did you know
about the tea party?

189
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:39,974
Oh, you know, I kind of like
secret tea parties, too.

190
00:08:40,378 --> 00:08:42,704
- I'm Patrick. That's Teresa.
- Hi.

191
00:08:43,491 --> 00:08:44,856
I'm Ashley Harrington.

192
00:08:44,976 --> 00:08:46,556
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- You, too.

193
00:08:46,676 --> 00:08:48,208
Now who's your mom and dad?

194
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:50,329
Xander Harrington
and Sadie Cardozo Harrington.

195
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,212
I know my address
and phone number, too.

196
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:55,733
Very good. Patrick and I are
actually looking for your mommy.

197
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:56,821
Do you know where she is?

198
00:08:56,941 --> 00:08:59,078
Outside.
We could go cheer her up.

199
00:08:59,569 --> 00:09:00,901
Is she sad, sweetie?

200
00:09:01,234 --> 00:09:03,740
She misses daddy.
He went away on a trip.

201
00:09:10,812 --> 00:09:13,213
Mr. Harrington, you prodded
Heather Evans into going

202
00:09:13,247 --> 00:09:14,879
into your brother's office,
didn't you?

203
00:09:15,215 --> 00:09:17,000
I told her
the file was on the desk.

204
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,170
What she did with that
information is her problem.

205
00:09:19,575 --> 00:09:21,491
You're the West coast
head of media operations,

206
00:09:21,611 --> 00:09:24,289
and you tell an employee about
a confidential layoff list?

207
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:26,970
(Inhales deeply) Well, I had
a feeling she'd be grateful.

208
00:09:27,432 --> 00:09:28,782
And she was.

209
00:09:29,332 --> 00:09:31,405
You exchanged the information
for sex.

210
00:09:35,971 --> 00:09:37,435
Yes. (Sighs) I did.

211
00:09:37,555 --> 00:09:39,576
Gate security
has you leaving the party

212
00:09:39,696 --> 00:09:41,560
just before your brother died
of his injuries.

213
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:45,012
I didn't know what had happened,
and I didn't particularly want

214
00:09:45,132 --> 00:09:47,955
to watch his coronation,
frankly. It's boring.

215
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:49,668
Forgive me, Xander.

216
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,498
Did you kill your brother,
Ed?

217
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:54,535
Would you give us a second?

218
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:58,319
No,
I did not kill my brother.

219
00:09:58,609 --> 00:10:00,320
Well, you didn't seem
that sad about his death.

220
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,954
Well, maybe I just don't
display my emotions to cops.

221
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:05,878
Maybe.

222
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,220
Look, I'd like to tell you
that Xander and I

223
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,569
were the best of friends,
but we weren't.

224
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:14,424
We're just different people.
We <i>were</i> different people.

225
00:10:17,099 --> 00:10:18,328
He'd...

226
00:10:19,348 --> 00:10:20,905
always do the right things,
say the right things.

227
00:10:21,025 --> 00:10:24,442
Dad would say, "jump."
He'd ask, "how high?"

228
00:10:24,886 --> 00:10:25,914
And you?

229
00:10:27,121 --> 00:10:28,747
Dad never asks me to jump.

230
00:10:29,656 --> 00:10:32,291
- Mommy! Mommy!
- Baby, Hmm?

231
00:10:32,325 --> 00:10:34,026
We're going to get ice cream.

232
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,199
Okay. One scoop, okay? (Kisses)
No spoiling dinner.

233
00:10:36,319 --> 00:10:37,558
Okay. (Giggles)

234
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:40,635
One scoop it is. And I'll e-mail
you the Arizona overnights.

235
00:10:40,755 --> 00:10:42,518
You've got that conference call
tomorrow with the affiliates.

236
00:10:43,172 --> 00:10:44,415
Okay. Thanks, Elizabeth.

237
00:10:46,367 --> 00:10:47,711
Come on.

238
00:10:50,272 --> 00:10:51,622
You haven't told her?

239
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,501
(Sighs)

240
00:10:53,621 --> 00:10:56,384
How do you tell a 6-year-old
her father's never coming home?

241
00:10:56,504 --> 00:10:58,015
Well, she pretty much
knows already.

242
00:10:58,135 --> 00:10:59,551
She just doesn't
understand it yet.

243
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:01,724
Nor do I. I just...

244
00:11:03,437 --> 00:11:07,080
I keep thinking Xander would
know exactly what to say to her.

245
00:11:07,384 --> 00:11:09,422
It's so stupid, huh?

246
00:11:09,542 --> 00:11:10,948
Xander
must have had enemies...

247
00:11:11,498 --> 00:11:13,781
business rivals
that resented his success?

248
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,388
Um... sure.

249
00:11:16,422 --> 00:11:18,073
Yeah, but nothing abnormal.

250
00:11:20,392 --> 00:11:23,030
Well, there is
the "Visualize" thing.

251
00:11:23,794 --> 00:11:26,295
The "Observer" is about to run
an investigative series,

252
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,320
and it's gonna be
very critical.

253
00:11:29,132 --> 00:11:30,831
Visualize?
The sort of religious group?

254
00:11:31,178 --> 00:11:32,598
You know,
it's more like a cult.

255
00:11:32,718 --> 00:11:35,271
It's brainwashing
with a sideline in tax fraud.

256
00:11:36,036 --> 00:11:38,170
You know, we got
a-a pretty nasty letter

257
00:11:38,204 --> 00:11:40,122
from their leader,
Bret Stiles...

258
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:42,687
threatening unspecified trouble
if we ran it.

259
00:11:42,807 --> 00:11:44,506
I can get you a copy.

260
00:11:44,626 --> 00:11:46,603
Oh, you...
you had me at "cult."

261
00:11:46,723 --> 00:11:51,045
(Indistinct conversations)

262
00:11:51,165 --> 00:11:52,416
Creepy.

263
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,654
What, you don't ke
giant eyeballs?

264
00:11:54,774 --> 00:11:56,013
No.

265
00:11:58,557 --> 00:12:00,293
Hi. I'm Steven Wench.

266
00:12:00,413 --> 00:12:02,025
Most folks call me
"Brother Steve."

267
00:12:02,672 --> 00:12:04,161
Are you the C.B.I. folks
who called?

268
00:12:04,281 --> 00:12:07,220
Yeah. Brother Patrick
and, uh, my brother Cho.

269
00:12:07,651 --> 00:12:08,678
(Steve)
Well, come this way.

270
00:12:08,798 --> 00:12:09,457
I'm sorry,

271
00:12:09,577 --> 00:12:11,888
but I'm afraid Mr. Stiles
isn't on the premises today.

272
00:12:12,008 --> 00:12:12,801
Where is he?

273
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,623
At this precise moment,
I don't know.

274
00:12:15,042 --> 00:12:16,864
Bret lives spontaneously.

275
00:12:17,124 --> 00:12:19,134
But I'm happy to help
with any questions.

276
00:12:20,121 --> 00:12:21,018
I have a question.

277
00:12:21,138 --> 00:12:23,161
Uh, what are they doing
in there with those gizmos?

278
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:26,197
That's where our technicians
assess for inner vision.

279
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:28,571
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

280
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,496
That sounds fun.
Can anyone do that?

281
00:12:32,026 --> 00:12:33,927
Um... sure.

282
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,763
Excellent. Cho, you got
the interview, right?

283
00:12:36,312 --> 00:12:37,666
Just, uh, sign in.

284
00:12:37,786 --> 00:12:38,801
Oh, yeah. Sure, sure.

285
00:12:38,921 --> 00:12:41,010
- Hey. I wanna go.
- Hi.

286
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:42,210
- Have a seat.
- Cool.

287
00:12:43,371 --> 00:12:44,585
Excellent.

288
00:12:45,756 --> 00:12:46,837
All right.

289
00:12:47,228 --> 00:12:49,236
(Imitates buzzer)
(Chuckles) Just kidding.

290
00:12:49,356 --> 00:12:51,142
W-what do I do?

291
00:12:51,547 --> 00:12:52,981
Well, place your fingers
on the orb

292
00:12:53,101 --> 00:12:55,009
- and, uh, tell me your name.
- You first.

293
00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:58,338
- David.
- Hi, David. I'm Patrick.

294
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,402
Fingers on the orb.
(Clicking keys)

295
00:13:04,955 --> 00:13:07,321
Do you find sadness
in the world around you?

296
00:13:07,909 --> 00:13:08,979
Yes.

297
00:13:10,103 --> 00:13:13,385
Do you find yourself dwelling
on the misfortunes of your past?

298
00:13:15,109 --> 00:13:16,398
Yeah.

299
00:13:18,033 --> 00:13:19,434
Do you often think

300
00:13:19,468 --> 00:13:21,779
people are secretly
out to get you?

301
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,003
Yes.

302
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,972
How you doing?

303
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:28,874
- How am I doing?
- (Cho) Yeah.

304
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,575
Uh, how am I doing?

305
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:32,543
Well, Patrick,

306
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:36,480
you have serious issues
with paranoia and depression

307
00:13:36,514 --> 00:13:40,350
and negative thinking
in general.

308
00:13:40,384 --> 00:13:41,984
(Whispers) What?

309
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:43,719
I would recommend

310
00:13:43,753 --> 00:13:45,104
our immersive visualization
program for you,

311
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:47,194
as a matter of urgency.

312
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:51,638
(Normal voice)
Oh, okay. Um...

313
00:13:53,128 --> 00:13:54,900
Do-do-do you...
do you take that?

314
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,797
Ah! Not so fast.

315
00:13:57,832 --> 00:13:59,655
You thought you had me,
didn't you?

316
00:13:59,775 --> 00:14:03,198
You guys have got
a sweet scheme going here.

317
00:14:03,617 --> 00:14:05,381
Maybe we should get going.

318
00:14:05,501 --> 00:14:06,892
We gotta go get a warrant.

319
00:14:15,348 --> 00:14:16,734
Before coming
to persecute us,

320
00:14:16,854 --> 00:14:19,531
did you even look
at Xander Harrington's wife?

321
00:14:20,069 --> 00:14:21,919
- Sadie. We look at everyone, sir.
- What about her?

322
00:14:22,488 --> 00:14:24,094
We heard there was trouble
in her marriage.

323
00:14:24,774 --> 00:14:27,970
If Xander divorced her,
there's a prenup.

324
00:14:29,024 --> 00:14:30,699
But if he dies,
she gets it all.

325
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:32,476
Where'd you hear that,
Steve?

326
00:14:32,596 --> 00:14:33,872
Do... do you have someone
on the inside?

327
00:14:33,992 --> 00:14:36,659
I've said enough.
Please leave.

328
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:37,802
Do you have a gift shop?

329
00:14:37,922 --> 00:14:40,300
- 'Cause I'd love
an eyeball mug or something.
- No.

330
00:14:40,824 --> 00:14:41,605
Okay.

331
00:14:42,766 --> 00:14:45,800
(Indistinct conversations)

332
00:14:47,436 --> 00:14:48,869
(Man) Good job, Steven.

333
00:14:48,903 --> 00:14:50,805
Good job.

334
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:52,919
That was...
beautifully handled.

335
00:14:53,613 --> 00:14:55,180
Thank you, Mr. Stiles.

336
00:14:55,215 --> 00:14:57,512
No, thank <i>you.</i>

337
00:14:58,061 --> 00:15:00,263
So the guy claims Stiles is only
threatening legal trouble,

338
00:15:00,581 --> 00:15:02,919
that Visualize is a religion
of science and peace.

339
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:05,609
Tell that to the TV reporter
from Atlanta.

340
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:08,994
Last spring,
he went off on Visualize,

341
00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:10,297
next day, he was flying
through the windshield

342
00:15:10,417 --> 00:15:11,786
of a member's car.

343
00:15:11,906 --> 00:15:12,682
One more thing.

344
00:15:12,802 --> 00:15:14,316
About Sadie and Xander's
marriage...

345
00:15:14,436 --> 00:15:15,535
An affair?

346
00:15:16,229 --> 00:15:17,254
No.

347
00:15:18,035 --> 00:15:20,939
Xander and I have been partners
in everything

348
00:15:20,973 --> 00:15:22,805
since the first week
of business school.

349
00:15:23,108 --> 00:15:25,799
I loved him,
and I respected him.

350
00:15:26,406 --> 00:15:27,986
I had no reason to stray.

351
00:15:28,593 --> 00:15:29,658
Neither did he.

352
00:15:30,482 --> 00:15:32,187
Sometimes you don't need
a reason.

353
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:34,537
Oh.

354
00:15:34,956 --> 00:15:36,394
Agent Lisbon, you're here.

355
00:15:37,204 --> 00:15:38,468
Something to report?

356
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:41,075
No, she just, um, thinks

357
00:15:41,195 --> 00:15:42,340
I was screwing around
on your son.

358
00:15:43,294 --> 00:15:45,216
Excuse me.
I have better things to do.

359
00:15:46,994 --> 00:15:48,688
Do you think
she was having an affair?

360
00:15:49,694 --> 00:15:51,220
On balance, no.

361
00:15:52,429 --> 00:15:53,777
Go on.

362
00:15:53,897 --> 00:15:56,366
Sadie loves this company,
as well as my son.

363
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,879
She'd never risk everything
for a roll in the hay.

364
00:16:00,144 --> 00:16:01,910
Ambitious as all hell,
that girl.

365
00:16:02,387 --> 00:16:03,789
I like it.
Don't get me wrong.

366
00:16:04,121 --> 00:16:05,292
She's doubled our profit

367
00:16:05,412 --> 00:16:07,429
since she took over
running the TV stations.
(Cell phone ringing)

368
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:10,531
Um... (Clicks tongue)
Excuse my rudeness.

369
00:16:11,268 --> 00:16:12,536
(Beeps)

370
00:16:14,008 --> 00:16:15,451
Agent Lisbon.

371
00:16:19,956 --> 00:16:21,776
- Get everybody out of the house.
- There's not enough time.

372
00:16:21,896 --> 00:16:24,046
- Do what you can.
- Tara! Sadie!

373
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,458
(Cell phone rings)

374
00:16:26,492 --> 00:16:28,822
(Groans)

375
00:16:28,856 --> 00:16:30,522
(Beep)

376
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:31,921
Hello?

377
00:16:31,955 --> 00:16:33,387
It's me. I need your help.

378
00:16:33,961 --> 00:16:35,432
Well, hello, Lisbon.
You need my help?

379
00:16:35,552 --> 00:16:37,625
I need your help
finding a bomb.

380
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:43,438
[ Indistinct conversations ]

381
00:16:43,558 --> 00:16:45,713
There's still time. You're good
at this kind of thing.

382
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,459
If we find the bomb intact,

383
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:48,921
maybe we can still get rid
of it.

384
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,015
What, are you nuts?
What do you want to do that for?

385
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,657
It's a bomb.
Just get out of there.

386
00:16:52,777 --> 00:16:54,841
The guy's got comprehensive
home insurance, I'm sure.

387
00:16:54,961 --> 00:16:57,374
Oh, come on, Jane. We've got
two minutes. All right?

388
00:16:57,494 --> 00:16:58,547
Where did they put it?

389
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:00,817
They said it was somewhere
in the grand salon.

390
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:02,581
Well, if they called it
the grand salon,

391
00:17:02,701 --> 00:17:04,060
then obviously
they're insiders.

392
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,145
Good point.

393
00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:06,913
Uh, l-leading us where?

394
00:17:06,947 --> 00:17:08,747
Uh, let me see.

395
00:17:08,782 --> 00:17:10,584
Uh, if I was familiar
with that room,

396
00:17:10,704 --> 00:17:12,469
I would plant a bomb...

397
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:15,228
Try under the sofa.
No, no, no, no, no. (Gasps)

398
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,784
The cupboard
over by the Dutch forgery

399
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:19,587
- in the corner.
- Uh, th-the painting?

400
00:17:19,707 --> 00:17:21,024
How do you know it's a forgery?

401
00:17:21,144 --> 00:17:22,689
Eh, the brushwork...
it's all wrong.

402
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:23,889
It's way too loose.

403
00:17:27,695 --> 00:17:29,614
(Whispers) Oh, my God.
You were right.

404
00:17:29,734 --> 00:17:30,813
Yeah, well, of course.

405
00:17:30,933 --> 00:17:33,403
That looser feeling didn't
develop until much later on.

406
00:17:33,437 --> 00:17:36,611
No! The bomb. I found it.
One minute left.

407
00:17:36,646 --> 00:17:38,850
Oh, good. Time to leave.
Get out of there.

408
00:17:38,884 --> 00:17:40,486
Lisbon, if you think
I am even gonna engage

409
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,554
in this game
of "which wire to pull,"

410
00:17:42,674 --> 00:17:44,000
I'm not interested.
I don't wanna play that game.

411
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,986
Just leave right now.
Run. Okay?

412
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,727
Okay. You're right.
I'm outta here.

413
00:17:47,847 --> 00:17:49,132
Thank you. Good.

414
00:17:49,434 --> 00:17:50,807
Where's mommy?

415
00:17:52,865 --> 00:17:55,454
- Hang on.
- Ashley?

416
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,936
- Ashley, we have to leave now.
- No!

417
00:17:58,970 --> 00:17:59,946
Lisbon!

418
00:18:00,066 --> 00:18:01,889
Ashley, get out
from under there. Ashley.

419
00:18:02,009 --> 00:18:03,223
No! No! I want my mommy!

420
00:18:03,343 --> 00:18:04,278
Sweetie, come on.
We have to go.

421
00:18:04,398 --> 00:18:05,673
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's going on there?

422
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,490
- (Strained voice) Ashley, come
on. Ashley! (Grunts) Ashley!
- No! Leave me alone!

423
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,503
I want my mommy! (Grunts)

424
00:18:10,821 --> 00:18:12,671
Come out! You come out now!
That's an order!

425
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,266
- Lisbon, pick up the girl and leave.
- (Ashley) I <i>want</i> my mommy!

426
00:18:14,386 --> 00:18:15,640
Just pick her up
and take her outside.

427
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,274
You can do that.
Run away now.

428
00:18:18,648 --> 00:18:19,906
Lisbon?

429
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:23,156
Ohh...

430
00:18:23,191 --> 00:18:25,622
Lisbon!

431
00:18:25,656 --> 00:18:27,623
Ohh...

432
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:30,658
(Grunts)

433
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:33,994
Lisbon!

434
00:18:39,232 --> 00:18:40,832
(Sighs)

435
00:18:45,936 --> 00:18:47,942
You are a very bad girl.

436
00:18:48,062 --> 00:18:50,284
(Sighs) You're a bad girl.

437
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:52,849
(Sighs)

438
00:18:59,123 --> 00:19:00,242
Agent Lisbon.

439
00:19:01,424 --> 00:19:02,617
Thank you.

440
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,958
Thank you for saving
my granddaughter.

441
00:19:04,993 --> 00:19:06,726
We are so grateful.
(Chuckles)

442
00:19:06,761 --> 00:19:08,282
It's all part of the service.

443
00:19:08,402 --> 00:19:10,888
No, you were brave
and resourceful,

444
00:19:11,008 --> 00:19:13,132
and I'll make sure
your supervisors say as much

445
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:14,301
in your file.

446
00:19:14,835 --> 00:19:17,872
Look, if there's ever anything
I can do for you personally,

447
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,737
please don't hesitate.

448
00:19:19,857 --> 00:19:22,733
Well, you could offer her the pad
for a weekend during the summer.

449
00:19:22,853 --> 00:19:24,677
Actually, uh, I was wondering
if I could speak

450
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:26,893
with some of your staff
who had access to that room.

451
00:19:27,013 --> 00:19:28,729
Ah, Edward.
Thank you for joining us.

452
00:19:28,849 --> 00:19:30,921
I just heard what happened.
Is everyone all right?

453
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:32,531
Oh, everyone's fine. It's fine.

454
00:19:32,651 --> 00:19:34,256
(Sighs) Well, if there's
anything I can do to help,

455
00:19:34,376 --> 00:19:35,390
just say the word.
I'm here.

456
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:38,805
Actually, uh, I'll be
issuing an announcement,

457
00:19:38,925 --> 00:19:42,360
and I wanted to let
you and Sadie know first.

458
00:19:42,395 --> 00:19:44,362
Announcements? Ooh,
I love announcements.

459
00:19:44,396 --> 00:19:46,831
Um, sh-should we order up
a round of cocktails?

460
00:19:48,182 --> 00:19:49,414
I'll make this quick.
(Sighs)

461
00:19:49,861 --> 00:19:52,503
Uh, as much as it pains me
to discuss business

462
00:19:52,931 --> 00:19:54,771
at a time like this...
but the fact is,

463
00:19:54,805 --> 00:19:57,739
we do have shareholders,
and the board has demanded

464
00:19:57,773 --> 00:19:59,881
a new C.E.O. be announced
immediately.

465
00:20:00,376 --> 00:20:02,477
(Whispers) Sadie, I bet.

466
00:20:07,782 --> 00:20:10,383
- Uh...
- Sadie. Wow.

467
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:13,052
Uh... Ed, I-I'm sorry.

468
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:15,621
No. No, that's okay.

469
00:20:15,655 --> 00:20:18,157
That's... it's your right
to name whoever you want.

470
00:20:18,192 --> 00:20:20,860
Uh, I-I don't know
what to say, Ed. I'm...

471
00:20:20,894 --> 00:20:23,715
No, it's okay. It's, um...
I get it. I get it.

472
00:20:23,835 --> 00:20:27,421
Um, I'm sure you'll do
a great job. Congratulations.

473
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:34,664
Okay...

474
00:20:34,784 --> 00:20:36,842
Well, I'm not gonna say
anything.

475
00:20:41,776 --> 00:20:43,497
The bomb threat...
we got something.

476
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,479
It came from the phone
of Elizabeth Stanfeld.

477
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:47,835
Sadie Harrington's assistant.
Let's go get that warrant.

478
00:20:49,616 --> 00:20:50,816
Nice work.

479
00:20:50,851 --> 00:20:52,422
(Chuckles) Thanks.

480
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:00,366
Kitchen's clear.

481
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,088
Bedroom, too.

482
00:21:05,946 --> 00:21:08,031
Van Pelt been acting weird
to you?

483
00:21:08,865 --> 00:21:10,967
<i>Please</i> don't talk to me
about Van Pelt.

484
00:21:11,001 --> 00:21:13,435
No, I won't. Has she?

485
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:15,062
(Taps)
No.

486
00:21:15,705 --> 00:21:18,373
It's just she's...
She's been smiling at me.

487
00:21:18,407 --> 00:21:20,107
No kidding.

488
00:21:20,142 --> 00:21:22,909
(Chuckles) Sometimes I think
she might still be into me.

489
00:21:22,943 --> 00:21:24,944
That'd be weird, huh?
(Chuckles)

490
00:21:24,978 --> 00:21:26,442
You're weird.

491
00:21:27,248 --> 00:21:28,614
Cold.

492
00:21:28,649 --> 00:21:30,778
You know, I don't think
Stanfeld's been here in a while.

493
00:21:30,898 --> 00:21:33,853
Hey, check this out.

Elizabeth Stanfeld's
a member of Visualize.

496
00:21:40,662 --> 00:21:42,570
Looks like Bret Stiles is gonna
be talking to us after all.

497
00:21:44,133 --> 00:21:46,967
The eye is not just the window
to the soul.

498
00:21:47,705 --> 00:21:51,367
It is the key
to unlocking your greatness.

499
00:21:51,681 --> 00:21:53,154
It is the key,

500
00:21:53,274 --> 00:21:56,349
because when you see it,
you will be it.

501
00:21:56,805 --> 00:21:58,234
(Bret) One more time.

502
00:21:58,354 --> 00:22:00,102
(Clicks tongue)

503
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,764
The eye is not just the window
to the soul.

504
00:22:05,287 --> 00:22:07,137
It is the key
to unlocking your greatness.

505
00:22:07,257 --> 00:22:08,975
(Patrick) Excuse me.
I'm sorry. Uh...

506
00:22:09,452 --> 00:22:13,321
The eye is the key?
Or the window? Or is it both?

507
00:22:13,441 --> 00:22:14,821
I'm a little confused.

508
00:22:14,855 --> 00:22:16,990
Mr. Jane, I presume.

509
00:22:17,025 --> 00:22:18,991
- Yeah.
- Hello. Welcome.

510
00:22:19,026 --> 00:22:19,975
Oh, you're expecting us?

511
00:22:20,095 --> 00:22:24,064
Oh, yes. And I presume this is
your long-suffering colleague,

more beautiful than advertised.

Oh, thanks, guy.
Take a little break. Thank you.

515

Give us a few minutes.
Thank you.

00:22:34,407 --> 00:22:35,906
(Clears throat) Thank you.

517
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,374
(Clears throat)

518
00:22:37,408 --> 00:22:39,309
Elizabeth Stanfeld,

519
00:22:39,343 --> 00:22:42,652
your, um... "Dear friend
and fine student"...

520
00:22:43,172 --> 00:22:44,480
she planted a bomb
at the Harringtons' house...

521
00:22:44,514 --> 00:22:47,315
a bomb she couldn't have
possibly made herself.

522
00:22:47,349 --> 00:22:50,341
Lisbon here defused it.
Heroine.

523
00:22:50,861 --> 00:22:54,587
Oh. Well, I-I'm... I mean,
I may have taught her.

524
00:22:54,622 --> 00:22:56,456
Uh... Stanfeld?

525
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:58,390
Oh.

526
00:22:58,425 --> 00:23:00,225
Uh, w-was she a brunette?

527
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:03,175
- Mr. Stiles, "dear friend"?
- Well, yeah, but, you know,

528
00:23:03,851 --> 00:23:05,563
I've signed millions
of these in my time.

529
00:23:05,597 --> 00:23:07,531
I always like
to personalize them.

530
00:23:07,565 --> 00:23:09,634
It's a little trick I learned
from an old friend of mine,

531
00:23:09,754 --> 00:23:10,859
Ronnie Reagan.

532
00:23:11,698 --> 00:23:13,679
So you have no knowledge
of this woman?

533
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:15,507
You have no knowledge
of any attacks

534
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:17,204
on the Harrington family?

535
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:18,985
That's your position, is it?

536
00:23:19,505 --> 00:23:21,842
No, it's not "my position."
(Chuckles)

537
00:23:21,877 --> 00:23:23,810
Actually, it's the truth.

538
00:23:24,491 --> 00:23:26,612
My eyes aren't, uh...
Windows or doors

539
00:23:26,647 --> 00:23:28,614
or even keys,
for that matter.

540
00:23:28,648 --> 00:23:30,241
I use 'em
to look at things,

541
00:23:30,361 --> 00:23:32,574
and what I'm looking at
right now is a big, fat liar.

542
00:23:34,186 --> 00:23:36,554
(Chuckles) Really?

543
00:23:36,588 --> 00:23:39,289
Really. Yes. Betrayed
by a faint facial tremor.

544
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:41,891
You could work on that
in the mirror.

545
00:23:41,926 --> 00:23:43,143
You'd get
some great results.

546
00:23:44,628 --> 00:23:46,028
Mm.

547
00:23:46,062 --> 00:23:48,675
You know, now I see why...

548
00:23:49,714 --> 00:23:52,509
Red John really enjoys
sparring with you.

549
00:23:53,477 --> 00:23:55,669
A worthy adversary, yeah?

550
00:23:55,704 --> 00:23:57,057
Yes.

551
00:23:59,523 --> 00:24:01,007
Straight for the jugular.

552
00:24:01,783 --> 00:24:03,710
Obviously,
you struck a nerve.

553
00:24:03,744 --> 00:24:05,057
Hmm.

554
00:24:05,505 --> 00:24:08,025
Losing a wife and a child
like that...

555
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:12,559
Well,
it makes a man reckless,

556
00:24:13,268 --> 00:24:14,552
untethered.

557
00:24:14,869 --> 00:24:17,139
Fills him with anger and shame

558
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,716
that he cannot express.

559
00:24:22,226 --> 00:24:24,802
Well, must make <i>your</i> job
very hard, hmm?

560
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:28,538
Yes,
but the health plan's great.

561
00:24:28,831 --> 00:24:30,598
Mm.

562
00:24:30,633 --> 00:24:32,273
(Chuckles)

563
00:24:33,168 --> 00:24:35,342
Mr. Jane,
I think we can help you.

564
00:24:35,671 --> 00:24:37,245
I think we can scrub

565
00:24:37,365 --> 00:24:40,974
that shame and grief
and self-hatred

566
00:24:41,009 --> 00:24:43,576
right out of your system.

567
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,313
Bret, please.

568
00:24:47,581 --> 00:24:49,863
(Laughs) We both know
what you are.

569
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,951
I mean, let's be honest here.
You're a con man.

570
00:24:52,985 --> 00:24:54,880
I mean, you're very charming,
and you're very good at it,

571
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,238
but you're just a con man.

572
00:24:56,994 --> 00:24:59,684
And you could no more help me
than you can fly to the moon.

573
00:25:00,045 --> 00:25:02,992
Mm. <i>Now</i> who's struck a nerve?

574
00:25:05,829 --> 00:25:07,879
Nobody's past helping...

575
00:25:08,865 --> 00:25:10,299
Even you.

576
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,965
Believe me
when I say this, Bret...

577
00:25:12,085 --> 00:25:13,744
you don't want
to make this personal.

578
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,455
Now give us Stanfeld,

579
00:25:16,575 --> 00:25:19,525
or I will make it
my sole purpose to hound you

580
00:25:19,645 --> 00:25:21,908
for the rest
of your miserable, phony life.

581
00:25:22,028 --> 00:25:26,612
(Laughs) Whoa.
Am I hearing a threat here?

582
00:25:26,647 --> 00:25:29,715
I mean, a-aren't there rules
about this sort of thing? Hmm?

583
00:25:29,749 --> 00:25:31,773
Like you said, untethered.

584
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,819
Mr. Stiles,

585
00:25:34,854 --> 00:25:37,188
the percentage play here
is to give us Stanfeld.

586
00:25:37,223 --> 00:25:40,011
She's not gonna betray you.
She's loyal.
(Sighs)

587
00:25:40,131 --> 00:25:41,645
(Clicks tongue)

588
00:25:41,765 --> 00:25:43,177
Forget it, Lisbon.

589
00:25:43,728 --> 00:25:45,362
I'm bored.

590
00:25:48,532 --> 00:25:51,868
Elizabeth is at
Edward Harrington's penthouse.

591
00:25:51,988 --> 00:25:54,155
She went to Edward?
To do what?

592
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,987
I don't know.

593
00:25:56,107 --> 00:25:59,259
Uh, she didn't tell me.
I gave her no instructions.

594
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,561
She went
of her own free will.

595
00:26:02,913 --> 00:26:04,810
Have a nice day.

596
00:26:05,326 --> 00:26:08,383
Rigsby, get to Ed Harrington's place
immediately.

597
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,548
(Keys jangle, lock clicks)

598
00:26:27,126 --> 00:26:28,593
(Whispers) It's clear.

599
00:26:28,627 --> 00:26:30,695
(Man exhales deeply and moans)

600
00:26:30,729 --> 00:26:32,697
(Normal voice) Police!
Don't move!

601
00:26:32,732 --> 00:26:34,634
- Let me see your hands! Freeze!
- Mr. Harrington?

602
00:26:34,668 --> 00:26:38,504
Mr. Harrington,
are you... all right?

603
00:26:38,538 --> 00:26:40,672
Yep. I think he's... fine.

604
00:26:40,707 --> 00:26:42,941
What the hell is going on?

605
00:26:45,417 --> 00:26:47,718
(Rigsby) See,
the way it looks from here

606
00:26:47,752 --> 00:26:49,323
is that you and Elizabeth
were in this together.

607
00:26:50,351 --> 00:26:51,784
Take out Xander,

608
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:53,686
take out your father,

609
00:26:53,721 --> 00:26:56,292
live happily ever after
with her and Bret Stiles.

610
00:26:56,326 --> 00:26:59,895
No. I'm not into
that Visualize crap.

611
00:26:59,929 --> 00:27:03,130
If I had any idea, I...
uh, she was just...

612
00:27:03,165 --> 00:27:05,566
just a friend.
(Paper flips)

613
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,135
Convenient, though, that
she seems intent on taking out

614
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:09,774
everyone between you and the top
job at Harrington Media.

615
00:27:10,193 --> 00:27:11,016
Was Sadie next?

616
00:27:11,136 --> 00:27:12,433
How do you know
<i>I</i> wasn't next?

617
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:16,146
Visualize wanted to kill us all
because of that idiotic story.

618
00:27:16,266 --> 00:27:17,548
Then why didn't she kill you,
Ed?

619
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,045
<i>- (Edward) I-I don't know.</i>
<i>- (Rigsby) You ever meet Bret Stiles?</i>

620
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,381
- No.
- Anyone at all from the
Visualize organization?

621
00:27:22,415 --> 00:27:24,949
- No.
- So let me get this straight...

622
00:27:24,984 --> 00:27:26,772
she was sleeping with you
because you were a Harrington,

623
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:29,172
but not an important enough
Harrington to kill. Is that it?

624
00:27:30,622 --> 00:27:32,855
You're a stooge.

625
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:35,729
Yeah, I'm a stooge.
Thanks for the heads-up.

626
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:44,880
So Bret Stiles claims
you acted alone.

627
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:47,064
But you had an accomplice,
didn't you?

628
00:27:47,844 --> 00:27:48,816
An accomplice to what?

629
00:27:49,399 --> 00:27:52,204
The bombing attempt.
We've got your phone records.

630
00:27:52,239 --> 00:27:53,722
Slam dunk. 20 years.

631
00:27:54,141 --> 00:27:55,287
2 decades.

632
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:57,965
7,000 days living in a box.

633
00:27:58,085 --> 00:27:59,544
I don't know how people do it.

634
00:27:59,664 --> 00:28:00,692
Now help yourself out
here.

635
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,568
We know
someone gave you that bomb.

636
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,869
We know
you didn't kill Xander.

637
00:28:03,989 --> 00:28:05,844
Sadie Harrington was with you
the entire party.

638
00:28:05,964 --> 00:28:07,035
Of course I didn't kill him.

639
00:28:07,155 --> 00:28:08,425
But you know who did.

640
00:28:09,364 --> 00:28:11,219
Give us a name,
and we can talk a deal.

641
00:28:15,233 --> 00:28:17,691
I'm looking down at you
from a great height.

642
00:28:19,426 --> 00:28:20,885
You're like ants.

643
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,262
It's sad how far
I am beyond you people,

644
00:28:25,158 --> 00:28:27,265
spiritually and mentally.

645
00:28:28,369 --> 00:28:30,680
Mm. But, uh, physically,

646
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,168
I think we, uh,
we might have the upper hand.

647
00:28:33,736 --> 00:28:35,717
And physically is kinda
how they roll in prison.

648
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,740
Just because you've stopped
my work

649
00:28:39,029 --> 00:28:41,408
doesn't mean others
won't follow in my path.

650
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,244
You can't imprison
the truth.

651
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:48,687
Oh, Lizzy, you are
batnuts crazy. Batnuts, girl.

652
00:28:48,933 --> 00:28:51,687
But that's okay. You're young.
You <i>can</i> recover your wits.

653
00:28:52,019 --> 00:28:53,490
You're gonna have to work
very hard,

654
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:54,853
but you've given me
a very good idea,

655
00:28:54,887 --> 00:28:56,488
and I thank you.

656
00:28:57,756 --> 00:29:00,257
Excuse me. We've come
to take my son home.

657
00:29:00,292 --> 00:29:02,693
- This is a family matter.
- I'm sorry, sir,

658
00:29:02,727 --> 00:29:05,728
- but we haven't finished
questioning him.
- Edward made a mistake.

659
00:29:05,763 --> 00:29:08,297
It was dangerous, yes,
but not criminal,

660
00:29:08,332 --> 00:29:11,099
so unless you have some evidence
linking him to a crime,

661
00:29:11,133 --> 00:29:14,201
- I'd like you to let him go.
- Let the poor wretch go, Van Pelt.

662
00:29:14,235 --> 00:29:15,879
He's guilty of nothing

663
00:29:15,999 --> 00:29:18,038
except extremely
poor decision-making,

664
00:29:18,073 --> 00:29:20,012
sexual partner-wise,
and, uh...

665
00:29:20,743 --> 00:29:22,243
Who hasn't been there?

666
00:29:22,277 --> 00:29:23,511
Jane.

667
00:29:23,545 --> 00:29:25,980
It isn't in my authority
to allow that, sir,

668
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:28,783
but if you'll wait a moment,
I'll find Agent Lisbon,

669
00:29:28,817 --> 00:29:31,184
and she may be able
to help you out.

670
00:29:31,219 --> 00:29:34,020
- Dad?
(Alex) Never mind. There he is.

671
00:29:34,055 --> 00:29:36,956
Eddie, we're leaving.

672
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:40,573
You bastard!
You stupid son of a bitch!

673
00:29:41,496 --> 00:29:44,998
How could you endanger us?
Ashley was nearly killed.

674
00:29:45,331 --> 00:29:46,075
I'm sorry.

675
00:29:46,811 --> 00:29:48,295
I'm gonna go wait
in the car.

676
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:49,863
I'm really sorry.

677
00:29:49,898 --> 00:29:53,266
You're sorry? Sorry?
You little fool.

678
00:29:53,301 --> 00:29:55,320
Have you no common sense,
boy?

679
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,094
- Are you completely...
- Sir, you're gonna have to take it easy.

680
00:29:58,933 --> 00:30:03,284
Anyhow, here we are. Let's go
home and discuss this.

681
00:30:03,404 --> 00:30:05,807
(Van Pelt) Mr. Harrington, that
isn't going to be possible.
(Cell phone rings)

682
00:30:05,875 --> 00:30:07,309
(Ring)

683
00:30:07,343 --> 00:30:09,277
Oh, hell. Not again.

684
00:30:09,311 --> 00:30:10,778
What's wrong?

685
00:30:10,812 --> 00:30:12,480
Miserable cowards.
More threats!

686
00:30:12,514 --> 00:30:14,616
What does it say?

687
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:17,251
"Next time
you won't be so lucky."

688
00:30:18,769 --> 00:30:20,832
Sent from the same number
as the earlier threat.

689
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:23,434
I thought you had traced
that call to Stanfeld.

690
00:30:23,554 --> 00:30:25,125
Well, they likely use
the same number

691
00:30:25,245 --> 00:30:26,599
for many different cloned cells.

692
00:30:26,719 --> 00:30:28,076
It proves it's
the same people, anyhow.

693
00:30:28,196 --> 00:30:29,629
Meaning Visualize.

694
00:30:29,664 --> 00:30:31,691
Agent Hightower,
I'm going to need

695
00:30:31,811 --> 00:30:33,577
additional protection
for my family,

696
00:30:33,697 --> 00:30:35,516
at least until we can get
to the house in London.

697
00:30:35,636 --> 00:30:36,472
Mr. Harrington,

698
00:30:36,592 --> 00:30:38,069
while your family's safety
is at stake,

699
00:30:38,189 --> 00:30:39,787
maybe it's best
to postpone the exposé.

700
00:30:39,907 --> 00:30:41,493
If I gave in,
where does it stop?

701
00:30:42,187 --> 00:30:44,051
My family would be
under constant threat

702
00:30:44,171 --> 00:30:46,357
from people who don't like
what I print or air.

703
00:30:47,485 --> 00:30:49,269
We need protection,
Agent Hightower.

704
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:50,250
Mr. Harrington,

705
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:52,769
the police assigned to you are
very well-trained personnel.

706
00:30:52,889 --> 00:30:54,070
We <i>can</i> add more if...

707
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,241
I want your best people...

708
00:30:55,993 --> 00:30:57,361
Ms. Lisbon and her team.

709
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:58,862
I'll insist on it.

710
00:30:59,166 --> 00:31:00,720
Mr. Harrington, that's
very flattering, but you...

711
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,108
and if you could release
my son now,

712
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:04,857
I'd appreciate it.

713
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:08,024
I'll see what we can do.

714
00:31:08,144 --> 00:31:12,573
(Police radio chatter,
indistinct conversations)

715
00:31:12,607 --> 00:31:16,291
(coos)

716
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:19,226
She's about to throw down
the queen of spades.

717
00:31:20,244 --> 00:31:21,792
Stop showing off.

718
00:31:23,085 --> 00:31:24,719
(Sighs)

719
00:31:26,132 --> 00:31:27,303
Ha.

720
00:31:27,592 --> 00:31:29,004
(Patrick)
That's what's called

721
00:31:29,124 --> 00:31:30,724
"cutting off your nose
to spite your face."

722
00:31:30,758 --> 00:31:32,124
(Cell phone rings)

723
00:31:32,158 --> 00:31:34,156
- I'll take that. Thank you.
- Lisbon.

724
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:35,481
- Good night, everyone.
- Good night.

725
00:31:35,601 --> 00:31:37,452
Alex, I told Ash
she could stay up if you

726
00:31:37,572 --> 00:31:39,389
- tucked her in. Is that okay?
- Absolutely.

727
00:31:40,801 --> 00:31:42,102
Thank you.

728
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:44,559
Night, sweetie.

729
00:31:44,593 --> 00:31:45,941
Perimeter's clear, boss.

730
00:31:46,061 --> 00:31:47,777
Just checked in
with the guards outside.

731
00:31:48,437 --> 00:31:52,219
Gin. There you go.
Who's next, any takers?

732
00:32:01,677 --> 00:32:05,012
(Clicks)

733
00:32:05,047 --> 00:32:07,315
Wish me luck.

734
00:32:15,089 --> 00:32:16,990
- Double.
- Sure.

735
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,594
(Clatter)

736
00:32:20,628 --> 00:32:22,562
(Patrick) Mm.

737
00:32:22,597 --> 00:32:24,230
You're a lucky man.

738
00:32:24,265 --> 00:32:26,199
- No such thing as luck.
- Really?

739
00:32:26,233 --> 00:32:29,402
It's all about knowing
the odds, seizing the chances.

740
00:32:29,436 --> 00:32:31,570
No luck involved.

741
00:32:31,604 --> 00:32:32,905
Hogwash.

742
00:32:32,939 --> 00:32:34,539
Hogwash?

743
00:32:34,574 --> 00:32:37,550
- You heard me. Hogwash.
- What's that?

744
00:32:39,144 --> 00:32:41,679
- What?
- Shh!

745
00:32:41,713 --> 00:32:43,080
(Lisbon) What are you...

746
00:32:43,114 --> 00:32:44,648
(Patrick) Shh!

747
00:32:44,682 --> 00:32:46,684
Wait a minute.
I hear it, too.

748
00:32:48,953 --> 00:32:51,322
(Whispers)
I got Ashley covered here.

749
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:56,024
- (Whispers) It's coming from in there.
- (Whispers) Xander's office?

750
00:32:56,058 --> 00:32:58,234
It's been sealed
since the murder.

751
00:32:59,546 --> 00:33:02,094
(Sighs)

752
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:13,970
(Switch clicks)

753
00:33:23,409 --> 00:33:24,776
(Normal voice) Clear.

754
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:27,118
(Normal voice) Wow. Could've
sworn I heard someone in here.

755
00:33:28,713 --> 00:33:30,113
(Exhales deeply)

756
00:33:30,148 --> 00:33:31,369
Oh, what's this?

757
00:33:32,683 --> 00:33:35,016
(Chuckles)
That's Ashley's.

758
00:33:35,968 --> 00:33:37,118
So?

759
00:33:37,152 --> 00:33:38,817
That's it.

760
00:33:39,062 --> 00:33:40,291
What's it?

761
00:33:40,682 --> 00:33:44,165
She was here.
She was right here.

762
00:33:44,762 --> 00:33:47,363
- What's he talking about?
- No idea.

763
00:33:47,397 --> 00:33:49,368
That's why she's been
so quiet and withdrawn.

764
00:33:49,488 --> 00:33:50,771
She witnessed the murder.

765
00:33:52,902 --> 00:33:55,637
(Alarm wailing)
(Lisbon) The power's been cut.

766
00:33:56,164 --> 00:33:59,607
Uh... w-we have
a-a backup generator.

767
00:33:59,641 --> 00:34:01,008
(Click, electricity hums)

768
00:34:01,042 --> 00:34:02,188
(Van Pelt)
Perimeter's been breached.

769
00:34:02,308 --> 00:34:05,441
- Someone's on the grounds.
- Copy that, Van Pelt.

770
00:34:05,561 --> 00:34:07,899
Charlie King one,
check the grounds.

771
00:34:08,937 --> 00:34:10,600
Charlie King one,
do you copy?

772
00:34:11,018 --> 00:34:13,453
Charlie King one?

773
00:34:14,881 --> 00:34:16,398
We're on our way
to the safe room.

774
00:34:16,518 --> 00:34:18,758
Secure Tara, Sadie
and the baby. Go!

775
00:34:21,885 --> 00:34:23,577
Come on.

776
00:34:24,242 --> 00:34:25,955
- Seal the door now.
- Mm.

777
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:29,794
(Lock clicks)

778
00:34:29,828 --> 00:34:31,631
(Voice breaks) Grandpa?

779
00:34:35,369 --> 00:34:37,270
(Chuckles)

780
00:34:37,304 --> 00:34:39,239
It's okay, honey.

781
00:34:44,328 --> 00:34:45,716
Don't be scared.

782
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:49,491
We're safe in here.

783
00:34:52,014 --> 00:34:54,073
Everything's gonna be
all right.

784
00:34:54,832 --> 00:34:56,194
Come on.

785
00:34:58,267 --> 00:34:59,496
There you go.

786
00:35:00,277 --> 00:35:02,596
Oh, I could do
with some chocolate.

787
00:35:03,506 --> 00:35:06,721
You have
any, uh, chocolate, Grace?

788
00:35:07,444 --> 00:35:08,659
- No.
- Just a little bit?

789
00:35:08,779 --> 00:35:11,184
- Van Pelt, what's the status?
- Lisbon, that was very good.

790
00:35:11,494 --> 00:35:13,810
- I have one question.
Who the hell is Charlie King?
- Call it up.

791
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:15,079
(Taps keys)

792
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,851
(Clicks)

793
00:35:21,659 --> 00:35:23,654
<i>I want mommy.</i>

794
00:35:26,709 --> 00:35:30,872
Hey, you remember the party
we had a few days ago?

795
00:35:30,992 --> 00:35:32,463
With all the flowers
and music?

796
00:35:32,583 --> 00:35:33,605
That's right.

797
00:35:33,725 --> 00:35:36,186
You were in daddy's office
that afternoon,

798
00:35:37,227 --> 00:35:39,895
before the guests got here
for the party, remember?

799
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:41,829
Uh, were you maybe...

800
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:44,857
Hiding under his desk?

801
00:35:44,977 --> 00:35:46,418
Playing tea party?

802
00:35:47,315 --> 00:35:50,284
It's all right if you were.
You won't get in trouble.

803
00:35:53,089 --> 00:35:54,868
Tell Grandpa the truth,
sweetheart.

804
00:35:57,576 --> 00:35:58,957
<i>(Sighs)</i>

805
00:35:59,829 --> 00:36:01,528
Ashley...

806
00:36:02,308 --> 00:36:03,588
If you were there,

807
00:36:05,026 --> 00:36:06,884
<i>maybe you saw the game</i>

808
00:36:07,967 --> 00:36:10,086
<i>Grandpa was playing</i>
<i>with Daddy.</i>

809
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,086
<i>Did you?</i>

810
00:36:15,726 --> 00:36:17,099
What the hell is going on?

811
00:36:17,374 --> 00:36:19,513
Uh, we... it's a very clever plan.
Would you like me to explain?

812
00:36:19,633 --> 00:36:20,978
Wait. Why are they
in the safe room?

813
00:36:21,098 --> 00:36:22,122
What are you doing?

814
00:36:22,242 --> 00:36:23,871
Ma'am, if you'll come with me,
I'll explain everything.

815
00:36:27,069 --> 00:36:28,854
30 seconds
and I'm pulling the plug.

816
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,991
Daddy's dead, isn't he?

817
00:36:32,584 --> 00:36:33,738
It was a game.

818
00:36:35,281 --> 00:36:36,354
<i>When your daddy fell...</i>

819
00:36:38,031 --> 00:36:40,951
<i>It was an accident.</i>
<i>I didn't mean to do it.</i>

820
00:36:43,614 --> 00:36:45,748
(Lowered voice) Cho.

821
00:36:45,783 --> 00:36:47,984
Put your hands
on your head.

822
00:36:48,803 --> 00:36:50,686
Now.

823
00:36:51,364 --> 00:36:53,431
You're under arrest.

824
00:36:56,558 --> 00:36:58,159
(Sighs)

825
00:37:03,094 --> 00:37:04,424
You're a bastard!
(Slap)

826
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:07,678
Uh, well,
thanks for the, uh, feedback.

827
00:37:08,025 --> 00:37:08,946
Always appreciated.

828
00:37:09,322 --> 00:37:10,603
What's wrong with Grandpa?

829
00:37:11,661 --> 00:37:13,205
It's okay, baby.
It's okay.

830
00:37:15,875 --> 00:37:19,043
(Police radio chatter)
You've got nothing.

831
00:37:20,021 --> 00:37:23,048
My lawyers will
grind this to dust.

832
00:37:24,634 --> 00:37:26,484
Don't say a single thing,
either of you.

833
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:29,730
They're saying I killed Xan.

834
00:37:30,463 --> 00:37:31,519
Well, that's not true, right?

835
00:37:33,436 --> 00:37:34,431
Of course not.

836
00:37:34,551 --> 00:37:36,600
It was very sweet
seeing you with Ashley.

837
00:37:36,903 --> 00:37:38,958
Uh,
I guess after two sons,

838
00:37:39,078 --> 00:37:40,927
when she came along,
it lit up your world.

839
00:37:43,251 --> 00:37:44,492
Strange, though,
that you can't

840
00:37:44,612 --> 00:37:46,039
so much as look
at your own daughter,

841
00:37:46,705 --> 00:37:48,601
nor barely touch
your lovely wife.

842
00:37:52,337 --> 00:37:54,686
How'd you find out
the baby wasn't yours?

843
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:57,529
I know that you believed Tara
was having an affair with Xander

844
00:37:57,649 --> 00:37:59,609
and that your son was
Ella's biological father.

845
00:37:59,729 --> 00:38:01,016
And you were partly right.

846
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:03,028
I mean, she was having an
affair with your son,

847
00:38:03,148 --> 00:38:06,235
but it wasn't with Xander.
Was it, Ed? Huh? <i>Oh!</i>

848
00:38:06,355 --> 00:38:09,555
Yeah, I figured it out
when I saw you two at the CBI.

849
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:11,759
She was very angry with you,
very angry.

850
00:38:12,459 --> 00:38:14,141
Pure jealousy.

851
00:38:15,379 --> 00:38:16,811
Oh, my God.

852
00:38:18,103 --> 00:38:19,125
I'm...

853
00:38:19,245 --> 00:38:20,996
Ella's father.
Congratulations.

854
00:38:21,256 --> 00:38:23,057
She's a real peach, actually.
She's great.

855
00:38:23,323 --> 00:38:25,900
No. Can't be.

856
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,990
(Whispers) I am so sorry.

857
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:30,265
No! It was Xander!

858
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:34,347
(Sighs) It was Xander.

859
00:38:34,467 --> 00:38:36,128
Okay. We'll take that
as a confession.

860
00:38:36,248 --> 00:38:37,892
Thank you.
Come on. Let's go.

861
00:38:38,543 --> 00:38:40,457
You really don't think
I can do anything, do you?

862
00:38:42,632 --> 00:38:44,088
It can't be.

863
00:38:44,208 --> 00:38:45,726
Well, it is. Sorry.

864
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,201
You killed the wrong son.

865
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,760
(Gasps)

866
00:38:52,696 --> 00:38:55,164
(Police radio chatter)

867
00:38:58,268 --> 00:39:01,502
Xander and Tara
seemed too close.

868
00:39:04,287 --> 00:39:06,223
Always whispering together
n the corners,

869
00:39:07,582 --> 00:39:09,813
breaking apart
when I'd come into the room.

870
00:39:10,893 --> 00:39:11,876
They were friends.

871
00:39:12,657 --> 00:39:14,373
They were probably talking
about her affair with Ed.

872
00:39:18,533 --> 00:39:20,440
So I ordered
a paternity test.

873
00:39:21,206 --> 00:39:23,526
The results came back

874
00:39:24,163 --> 00:39:25,528
the day of the party.

875
00:39:28,782 --> 00:39:31,555
<i>Ella is not my child,</i>

876
00:39:31,989 --> 00:39:33,911
<i>but you know that already,</i>
<i>don't you?</i>

877
00:39:34,031 --> 00:39:35,756
<i>What did you expect, Dad?!</i>

878
00:39:35,876 --> 00:39:38,236
<i>You treat her like just another</i>
<i>one of your possessions,</i>

879
00:39:38,356 --> 00:39:40,313
<i>but she's not!</i>
(Alex) I confronted Xan.

880
00:39:40,433 --> 00:39:42,425
<i>You betrayed me!</i>

881
00:39:42,545 --> 00:39:44,628
He didn't deny it.

882
00:39:46,464 --> 00:39:48,519
Why didn't he just deny it?

883
00:39:49,244 --> 00:39:52,247
(Patrick) He assumed
you knew it was Ed.

884
00:39:52,367 --> 00:39:53,288
<i>You!</i>

885
00:39:53,322 --> 00:39:55,746
<i>Aah!</i>

886
00:39:57,077 --> 00:39:58,329
When I think...

887
00:39:59,818 --> 00:40:01,599
of what poor Ashley saw...

888
00:40:03,305 --> 00:40:05,204
She didn't see anything.
I made it up.

889
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:09,349
But the teacup...
she was there.

890
00:40:09,826 --> 00:40:11,878
(Whispers) Yes, I know.

891
00:40:13,107 --> 00:40:14,598
But it's all in the wrist.

892
00:40:16,575 --> 00:40:18,209
(Teacup clatters on table)

893
00:40:21,579 --> 00:40:24,214
(Sighs)

894
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,824
(Bret) My good friend
Senator Aleman

895
00:40:31,944 --> 00:40:33,935
is very concerned
about my treatment.

896
00:40:34,055 --> 00:40:36,763
- Of course, you <i>do</i> know
the good Senator, huh?
- Yes.

897
00:40:36,883 --> 00:40:39,197
- Chair of the Justice Committee.
- I know him.

898
00:40:40,528 --> 00:40:42,688
Bret Stiles.
Good to see you.

899
00:40:43,234 --> 00:40:44,305
Looking sharp.

900
00:40:45,187 --> 00:40:47,183
(Clears throat)
I mean, I'd hate to tell him

901
00:40:47,303 --> 00:40:49,290
that you failed to resolve
this matter.

902
00:40:51,141 --> 00:40:52,873
So why don't we
resolve it right now?

903
00:40:53,249 --> 00:40:54,810
Mm.
Good.

904
00:40:54,845 --> 00:40:57,267
Patrick,
Mr. Stiles here says that

905
00:40:57,387 --> 00:41:00,801
you antagonized him
and conducted yourself in a way

906
00:41:00,921 --> 00:41:02,526
that reflected poorly
on the bureau.

907
00:41:02,646 --> 00:41:04,019
Do you have anything
to say?

908
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,958
Uh, no.
I'm...I'm good, thanks.

909
00:41:08,826 --> 00:41:09,830
Okay.

910
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:11,567
Actually, there's one thing
I'd like to say.

911
00:41:11,687 --> 00:41:13,548
- Is this gonna be helpful, Patrick?
- Probably not.

912
00:41:13,793 --> 00:41:16,557
Okay, then, there you go.
Nice talking with you.

913
00:41:17,005 --> 00:41:19,851
What? You're... you're kidding,
right? That's it?

914
00:41:20,383 --> 00:41:23,541
No. Do give my best
to Senator Aleman.

915
00:41:23,576 --> 00:41:25,744
Is he still seeing
that stripper in Bakersfield?

916
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:28,361
Lovely girl.

917
00:41:32,151 --> 00:41:34,667
Well, well. (Chuckles)

918
00:41:36,156 --> 00:41:39,224
(Sniffs) I can see
that I've met my match here.

919
00:41:39,344 --> 00:41:40,781
You two...

920
00:41:40,901 --> 00:41:42,323
quite the double act.

921
00:41:43,345 --> 00:41:46,079
Ah.
I will retreat, chastened.

922
00:41:49,764 --> 00:41:51,079
By the way...

923
00:41:53,971 --> 00:41:56,400
We will find a way to charge you
with that attempted bombing.

924
00:41:58,309 --> 00:42:00,952
Miss Hightower, shh.

925
00:42:01,072 --> 00:42:02,817
Don't push your luck.

926
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:08,140
So long, Bret.

927
00:42:10,308 --> 00:42:12,191
Don't draw the wrong lesson
here, Patrick.

928
00:42:13,418 --> 00:42:14,990
I've got Stiles checkmated.

929
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:17,096
But if a player
with real juice came in here,

930
00:42:17,775 --> 00:42:19,901
I'd want to see you dance
for him.

931
00:42:20,855 --> 00:42:22,819
Isn't that what we just did?

932
00:42:23,065 --> 00:42:24,219
You know what I mean.

933
00:42:24,734 --> 00:42:26,144
Okay.

934
00:42:26,593 --> 00:42:28,646
And I do love to dance.

935
