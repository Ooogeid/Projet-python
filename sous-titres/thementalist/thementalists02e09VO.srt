1
00:01:24,298 --> 00:01:25,416
Which one's ours?

2
00:01:25,673 --> 00:01:28,389
The one who looks like
she blows her nose with $100 bills.

3
00:01:29,678 --> 00:01:31,475
- They all look like that.
- Joke.

4
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,552
That's her over there.
Let's go.

5
00:01:35,525 --> 00:01:37,445
We shouldn't have
to be asking for charity.

6
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,111
The department needs the money.

7
00:01:39,236 --> 00:01:40,236
Smile.

8
00:02:02,563 --> 00:02:04,252
Mrs. Doverton? Hi.

9
00:02:04,584 --> 00:02:06,655
I'm Teresa Lisbon.
This is Kimball Cho.

10
00:02:10,218 --> 00:02:11,463
We're with the CBI.

11
00:02:11,588 --> 00:02:13,257
You're sponsoring us, I believe.

12
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,010
Of course. Yes.

13
00:02:16,222 --> 00:02:17,115
Welcome.

14
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,263
I was very sorry
for your terrible loss.

15
00:02:21,195 --> 00:02:22,975
- You know, those agents.
- Thank you.

16
00:02:23,485 --> 00:02:25,644
I can only imagine
what you must all be feeling.

17
00:02:26,025 --> 00:02:27,188
We don't talk about it.

18
00:02:29,183 --> 00:02:29,940
Thanks.

19
00:02:43,825 --> 00:02:46,249
I'd like to introduce you
to my nephews.

20
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:47,624
This is Thomas.

21
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,454
Say hello, Thomas.

22
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:54,465
Please call me Tom.

23
00:02:55,811 --> 00:02:56,967
And this is George.

24
00:02:58,343 --> 00:02:59,600
So, Miss Lisbon,

25
00:03:00,476 --> 00:03:02,540
what entertainment
you've planned tonight?

26
00:03:02,735 --> 00:03:05,725
Actually, a member of our team
used to be in show business.

27
00:03:05,895 --> 00:03:07,182
He's sort of a magician,

28
00:03:07,774 --> 00:03:10,424
And he's going to entertain us,
hopefully.

29
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,277
How nice.

30
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:45,933
What?

31
00:03:46,662 --> 00:03:47,812
Just a smile.

32
00:03:49,876 --> 00:03:51,034
He just smiled.

33
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:52,368
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

34
00:03:52,493 --> 00:03:56,193
<i>Please welcome Patrick Jane
of California Bureau Investigation.</i>

35
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,424
<i>Good evening.</i>

36
00:04:05,341 --> 00:04:06,865
<i>You're a very good-looking crowd.</i>

37
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,434
<i>Thank you for coming this evening.
You, too, back there.</i>

38
00:04:09,758 --> 00:04:12,045
<i>You look very regal
up there in the window.</i>

39
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,662
<i>My name is Patrick Jane.
I'm from the CBI.</i>

40
00:04:14,965 --> 00:04:16,223
<i>This is an egg.</i>

41
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:20,296
<i>I'm supposed to do magic tricks
and read minds for you,</i>

42
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,797
<i>But after some thought, I...</i>

43
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,693
<i>decided what the hell?</i>

44
00:04:24,923 --> 00:04:28,128
<i>I don't really want to do
that corny old stuff, so...</i>

45
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,594
<i>Instead what I'd like to do
is much cooler.</i>

46
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,699
<i>I would like to transform</i>

47
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,301
<i>your consciousness.</i>

48
00:04:47,872 --> 00:04:51,206
<i>Have any of you ever stopped to consider
what lucky bastards you all are...</i>

49
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:56,701
<i>If you think about all the suffering
and the injustice in the world?</i>

50
00:04:57,375 --> 00:05:00,240
<i>Every second of every day
there is someone,</i>

51
00:05:00,891 --> 00:05:01,891
<i>somewhere</i>

52
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,310
<i>crying out in pain and fear.</i>

53
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:09,141
<i>A woman is raped.</i>

54
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:11,093
<i>A child starves to death.</i>

55
00:05:11,218 --> 00:05:14,118
<i>A man is executed
for a crime he didn't commit.</i>

56
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:16,920
<i>But here we are.</i>

57
00:05:17,765 --> 00:05:21,154
<i>We could be standing on a roof
in some bangladeshi village,</i>

58
00:05:21,461 --> 00:05:23,739
<i>waiting for the flood waters
to recede.</i>

59
00:05:29,828 --> 00:05:30,663
<i>But, no,</i>

60
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,732
<i>here we are, In this</i>

61
00:05:32,857 --> 00:05:34,157
<i>lavish ballroom,</i>

62
00:05:35,859 --> 00:05:37,749
<i>Sipping french champagne,</i>

63
00:05:37,922 --> 00:05:40,172
<i>declining the hors d'oeuvres.
Thank you very much.</i>

64
00:05:42,454 --> 00:05:44,149
<i>Put your hands in the air,</i>

65
00:05:44,687 --> 00:05:46,139
<i>Anyone that feels lucky.</i>

66
00:05:46,351 --> 00:05:49,066
<i>If you think you are lucky,
put your hands up.</i>

67
00:05:49,191 --> 00:05:50,191
<i>That's right.</i>

68
00:05:50,474 --> 00:05:52,935
<i>We here are all blessed by fortune.</i>

69
00:05:54,065 --> 00:05:56,230
<i>If you disagree,
put down your hands.</i>

70
00:05:57,187 --> 00:05:58,232
<i>If you don't think</i>

71
00:05:58,426 --> 00:06:01,249
<i>you need to express your thanks
for that blessing,</i>

72
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,369
<i>put down your hand.</i>

73
00:06:06,045 --> 00:06:09,192
<i>If you're not willing to write a check.
That will save actual lives,</i>

74
00:06:09,317 --> 00:06:11,203
<i>then please put down your hands.</i>

75
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:14,970
<i>That's great.</i>

76
00:06:16,516 --> 00:06:17,516
<i>Very good.</i>

77
00:06:19,173 --> 00:06:20,173
<i>Now magic.</i>

78
00:06:21,282 --> 00:06:23,787
<i>You, sir, put your left hand
in your jacket pocket</i>

79
00:06:23,912 --> 00:06:26,878
<i>and take out whatever is in there.
And show it to everybody.</i>

80
00:06:33,888 --> 00:06:34,888
Thank you.

81
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:52,327
Make those checks legible.

82
00:06:52,691 --> 00:06:54,698
A novel way of raising money,
I must say.

83
00:06:55,145 --> 00:06:56,957
The direct approach
sometimes the best.

84
00:06:57,715 --> 00:06:58,865
Do excuse me.

85
00:07:00,502 --> 00:07:02,841
You son of a bitch.
You scared the crap out of me.

86
00:07:02,966 --> 00:07:06,050
Please, like I don't know
how to work a fat crowd of suckers.

87
00:07:09,546 --> 00:07:10,546
What?

88
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:17,101
What's the matter?

89
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:18,888
Carl's been shot.

90
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:30,767


91
00:07:33,743 --> 00:07:35,537
Whoever they were, they were.

92
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:37,621
Bypassed the alarm system somehow,

93
00:07:37,746 --> 00:07:40,342
shut off the security cameras.
Prints are unlikely.

94
00:07:40,906 --> 00:07:43,058
When was the last time
you changed the lock code?

95
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,334
That was a classified b vault door.

96
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:47,466
I was told that no one
could get through it.

97
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:49,230
Insurance had damn well better pay.

98
00:07:49,355 --> 00:07:52,491
Good safecracker get through anything
with the right tools and enough time.

99
00:07:52,679 --> 00:07:55,038
- This is beautiful. Look at that.
- Excuse me.

100
00:07:57,274 --> 00:07:58,435
Would you stop that?

101
00:07:59,177 --> 00:08:00,061
Sure.

102
00:08:00,186 --> 00:08:02,147
Just having a look.
Got some cool stuff in here.

103
00:08:04,107 --> 00:08:05,107
Very cool.

104
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,694
You are brothers, right?

105
00:08:08,304 --> 00:08:09,304
Indeed.

106
00:08:09,485 --> 00:08:11,845
Nice to see that the case
is in such perceptive hands.

107
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,742
Can hands be perceptive?
I don't think so.

108
00:08:15,452 --> 00:08:17,041
So is it usual that your uncle

109
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:18,704
is here after closing?

110
00:08:19,043 --> 00:08:20,761
He's not our uncle exactly.

111
00:08:21,011 --> 00:08:24,061
I'm sorry.
The man having sex with your aunt then.

112
00:08:31,684 --> 00:08:33,744
But tonight was the benefit.
Carl must have

113
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:37,057
forgotten something, come back
and surprised the thieves.

114
00:08:37,945 --> 00:08:38,851
Sure did.

115
00:08:42,026 --> 00:08:44,281
What's the deal
with Carl and your aunt?

116
00:08:44,406 --> 00:08:45,788
How did they get together?

117
00:08:45,913 --> 00:08:47,683
They met four years ago at the club.

118
00:08:47,808 --> 00:08:49,897
The labor day
senior tennis tournament.

119
00:08:50,022 --> 00:08:51,697
He was a pro back east.

120
00:08:52,545 --> 00:08:54,850
And they married,
and he joined the family business?

121
00:08:55,148 --> 00:08:56,443
Yes, that's correct.

122
00:08:56,716 --> 00:08:59,163
Does your resentment of him
create any tension?

123
00:08:59,994 --> 00:09:00,956
Resentment?

124
00:09:01,464 --> 00:09:02,916
Well, the old girl gets laid.

125
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:06,340
Next thing you know,
you got a new business partner.

126
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:09,089
Come on. You resent him.

127
00:09:10,372 --> 00:09:11,717
Carl's been a godsend.

128
00:09:12,362 --> 00:09:14,761
A natural salesman,
and he's made Esther very happy.

129
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:17,097
Yes, that's the main thing.

130
00:09:17,511 --> 00:09:18,724
If I may say so,

131
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,935
what I do very much resent
is the tone of your questioning.

132
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:24,621
- Sorry if we've offended you.
- Don't say that.

133
00:09:24,746 --> 00:09:27,900
This is a murder investigation.
I can be as hard-ass as I'd like to be.

134
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,777
Actually,
it's not a murder investigation yet.

135
00:09:31,357 --> 00:09:33,459
If Mr. Ward dies,
which seems likely,

136
00:09:33,584 --> 00:09:35,461
It'll become a murder investigation.

137
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,767
That's right. He's not dead.

138
00:09:39,518 --> 00:09:41,418
I apologize for my rudeness.

139
00:09:44,232 --> 00:09:45,083
Let's go.

140
00:09:54,766 --> 00:09:56,595
We get a break in the case, boss.

141
00:09:56,968 --> 00:09:58,376
This is last night's footage

142
00:09:58,501 --> 00:10:00,529
from a parking lot camera
across the street.

143
00:10:00,707 --> 00:10:03,085
That's Doverton & Co.
Back there on the right.

144
00:10:03,951 --> 00:10:06,433
So now we zoom in like this...

145
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,267
and there, that's him.

146
00:10:09,758 --> 00:10:12,110
Then I checked the new cameras
the city put in,

147
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,046
to catch traffic light violations.

148
00:10:14,171 --> 00:10:17,475
I figured I'd look at the ones nearest
to Doverton's around that time of night.

149
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:22,204
Car's registered to Doyle Murphy.
His sheet's a mile long and

150
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:23,914
safecracking was his specialty.

151
00:10:24,425 --> 00:10:25,874
I got an address in locke.

152
00:10:26,122 --> 00:10:27,167
Nice work.

153
00:10:27,572 --> 00:10:28,481
Quick.

154
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,171
It's your hook. Contact local P.D.
and have them pick him up.

155
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,810
- Take Rigsby.
- Thanks.

156
00:10:32,935 --> 00:10:34,729
It's all very neat and easy.

157
00:10:35,796 --> 00:10:38,845
- Sometimes it happens that way.
- I'll take a layup anytime, thank you.

158
00:10:39,913 --> 00:10:41,431
You're the professionals here,

159
00:10:41,872 --> 00:10:44,309
but is it usual
that there is a single perpetrator

160
00:10:44,434 --> 00:10:46,144
for this kind of a jewelry heist?

161
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,605
No, at least two.
Sometimes maybe three or four.

162
00:10:49,045 --> 00:10:51,250
Then there's the timing
of the robbery.

163
00:10:51,555 --> 00:10:53,652
Weren't those diamonds supposed
to be picked up?

164
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,362
Yeah, 10:15, when they opened.

165
00:10:55,933 --> 00:10:57,572
You think maybe it's an inside job?

166
00:10:57,945 --> 00:10:58,865
Yes, I do.

167
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,688
Guess what? We're way ahead of you,

168
00:11:00,813 --> 00:11:03,098
we're doing background checks
on the Doverton staff list.

169
00:11:03,223 --> 00:11:06,023
My provisional bet,
provisional... Carl Ward.

170
00:11:07,047 --> 00:11:08,667
Hello? He was shot three times.

171
00:11:09,129 --> 00:11:11,378
- Best accomplice is a dead one.
- But he's not dead.

172
00:11:11,745 --> 00:11:13,542
- Nobody's perfect.
- That's it?

173
00:11:14,143 --> 00:11:16,008
Carl Ward is crooked
because he got shot?

174
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,010
- He's an ex-tennis pro.
- So?

175
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:21,062
Shady people, by definition,
disappointed.

176
00:11:21,187 --> 00:11:22,830
Should be on center court,
Wimbledon.

177
00:11:22,955 --> 00:11:24,892
Instead is tossing lobs
to rich old ladies.

178
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,019
- Makes him bitter and twisted.
- Case closed.

179
00:11:27,431 --> 00:11:28,501
I'm just saying.

180
00:11:28,713 --> 00:11:31,148
Go talk to Murphy.
See what he has to say about it.

181
00:11:32,565 --> 00:11:33,601
I'm just saying.

182
00:11:48,825 --> 00:11:51,340
Jane knows about us.
I'm sure he does.

183
00:11:54,308 --> 00:11:56,757
Why would it be so bad
i people figured out we're together?

184
00:11:57,956 --> 00:11:59,006
Because....

185
00:12:00,989 --> 00:12:02,054
What do you mean?

186
00:12:02,851 --> 00:12:03,951
I just mean,

187
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,059
- is this it?
- What? This building?

188
00:12:07,944 --> 00:12:08,964
I mean us.

189
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,350
Is this all it's gonna be,

190
00:12:11,475 --> 00:12:14,207
Sneaking around all the time,
afraid someone's gonna find out?

191
00:12:14,332 --> 00:12:17,361
It's just the bureau rules.
The rules are the rules, right?

192
00:12:18,435 --> 00:12:19,863
Maybe I'm sick of the rules.

193
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:21,808
Thar she blows.

194
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:41,135
- You don't want to talk about it?
- I do, but not here, not on the job.

195
00:12:41,896 --> 00:12:44,304
- We'll have to talk about it sometime.
- Yeah. Soon.

196
00:12:46,994 --> 00:12:47,903
CBI.

197
00:12:48,587 --> 00:12:51,747
I'd like to know about the resident
who owns the blue beater there.

198
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:53,090
Murphy?

199
00:12:53,837 --> 00:12:56,024
Pays his rent, makes no trouble.

200
00:12:57,286 --> 00:12:58,287
What'd he do?

201
00:12:59,343 --> 00:13:01,016
Has he had any visitors recently?

202
00:13:02,167 --> 00:13:03,907
Wait. Yeah, couple hours ago.

203
00:13:04,752 --> 00:13:06,159
Big guy in a cowboy hat,

204
00:13:06,663 --> 00:13:07,807
pimped-out truck.

205
00:13:07,932 --> 00:13:10,333
Stayed... five minutes, split.

206
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,411
Does Murphy's room have any rear exit
of any kind? A window?

207
00:13:16,167 --> 00:13:17,170
What did he do?

208
00:13:19,918 --> 00:13:22,088
State agents.
We need to talk to you.

209
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:36,307
Go.

210
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,569
Clear.

211
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,453
I guess that lets Carl Ward
off the hook then, huh?

212
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:05,802
Ballistics owes me,
expedited the report.

213
00:14:06,405 --> 00:14:09,264
This gun was used to shoot
both Doyle Murphy and Carl Ward.

214
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:12,267
There were no jewels in the room
or the car. No prints on the gun.

215
00:14:12,907 --> 00:14:15,459
Start going through all
of Murphy's known associates.

216
00:14:15,584 --> 00:14:17,397
Looking for a cowboy
in a fancy truck.

217
00:14:17,618 --> 00:14:19,716
Kind of a thin trail.
Murphy's a career criminal.

218
00:14:19,841 --> 00:14:21,450
He has a lot of associates.

219
00:14:23,478 --> 00:14:24,571
Maybe I can help.

220
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:25,931
Just maybe?

221
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,408
Feeling unsure about yourself,
are you?

222
00:14:28,695 --> 00:14:30,577
Don't let one wrong hunch throw you.

223
00:14:31,076 --> 00:14:33,541
<i>A, we don't know yet
that I'm wrong about Ward,</i>

224
00:14:33,871 --> 00:14:36,583
<i>And b, bring the motel desk
clerk in.</i>

225
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:40,879
Maybe he can recall a little more detail
than he thinks about this cowboy.

226
00:14:43,346 --> 00:14:44,480
Can you see him?

227
00:14:46,363 --> 00:14:47,564
What's he doing?

228
00:14:47,961 --> 00:14:49,471
He's getting out of the truck.

229
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,807
And he's walking across
the forecourt

230
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,389
to Murphy's room.

231
00:14:55,746 --> 00:14:57,938
Can you read the license plate
on the truck?

232
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,107
Look closer.

233
00:15:03,137 --> 00:15:04,861
No, I can't. It's blocked.

234
00:15:05,123 --> 00:15:06,404
What's he wearing?

235
00:15:06,707 --> 00:15:08,266
Cowboy hat, brown.

236
00:15:10,344 --> 00:15:11,444
Black jeans.

237
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:13,970
Sunglasses, aviator style.

238
00:15:14,793 --> 00:15:16,231
That's very good, Marty.

239
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,170
What else can you see?

240
00:15:20,914 --> 00:15:23,171
He's wearing a T-shirt with a bulldog
on the front,

241
00:15:24,213 --> 00:15:26,090
Under it, "true blue."

242
00:15:51,585 --> 00:15:52,843
Donald Culpepper?

243
00:15:54,126 --> 00:15:55,412
Who the hell are you?

244
00:15:58,053 --> 00:15:59,053
Quiet.

245
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:03,335
I've reason to believe
that you visited with Doyle Murphy

246
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,449
at the starlite motor court.
Is that correct?

247
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:07,629
That's partially correct.

248
00:16:07,754 --> 00:16:10,218
I went to see him.
He wasn't there, so I left.

249
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,778
Why'd you go see him?

250
00:16:12,546 --> 00:16:15,557
Social visit. Catching up.
He was married to my sister.

251
00:16:15,788 --> 00:16:18,685
We have sad news.
Your ex-brother-in-law is dead.

252
00:16:19,431 --> 00:16:20,567
I'm in shock.

253
00:16:22,334 --> 00:16:23,440
How'd that happen?

254
00:16:23,873 --> 00:16:24,973
He was shot.

255
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,901
Any idea who might want to do that?

256
00:16:28,826 --> 00:16:29,779
How about you?

257
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,160
I have nothing but love for Murph.

258
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:35,463
- Why would you think otherwise?
- Because we read your rap sheet.

259
00:16:35,588 --> 00:16:38,371
You're a professional criminal
Implicated in several murders.

260
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:41,423
I'm a dynamic businessman
who pushes the envelope.

261
00:16:41,999 --> 00:16:45,003
Anybody can imply anything.
It's another thing to make it stick.

262
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:47,577
Get out.

263
00:16:47,702 --> 00:16:49,758
We need to continue
this conversation downtown.

264
00:16:56,243 --> 00:16:57,152
Thanks.

265
00:16:58,945 --> 00:17:01,519
I deduce from the irritated tone
of your phone conversation

266
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,229
That I was right about Carl Ward.

267
00:17:04,969 --> 00:17:05,969
Half right.

268
00:17:06,644 --> 00:17:07,400
Go on.

269
00:17:09,724 --> 00:17:11,498
His real name's Carl Wysocki.

270
00:17:11,623 --> 00:17:13,676
He was in jail for kiting checks.

271
00:17:13,801 --> 00:17:15,784
He's got an ex-wife in Bayonne,
New Jersey,

272
00:17:16,683 --> 00:17:18,933
Who's owed $90,000 in back alimony.

273
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:21,598
Half?

274
00:17:31,975 --> 00:17:34,275
So he changed his name.
What of it?

275
00:17:34,816 --> 00:17:36,262
Did you know about the jail time?

276
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:37,931
Of course I did.

277
00:17:38,444 --> 00:17:39,599
And the ex-wife?

278
00:17:40,196 --> 00:17:41,851
Of course. He told me everything.

279
00:17:42,207 --> 00:17:42,936
Liar.

280
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:44,938
Bad liar.

281
00:17:45,344 --> 00:17:46,272
How dare you.

282
00:17:46,501 --> 00:17:48,855
It's a compliment to your character.

283
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,453
You rather be a good liar?

284
00:17:53,856 --> 00:17:56,156
I knew everything about Carl's past.

285
00:17:56,998 --> 00:17:58,472
We're glad he told you, Ma'am,

286
00:17:58,597 --> 00:18:01,208
Because we have to consider
the possibility that he was somehow

287
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:04,009
involved in the jewel heist
and double-crossed.

288
00:18:04,273 --> 00:18:07,473
His honesty with you
makes him far less of a suspect.

289
00:18:07,656 --> 00:18:10,004
Do you have anything further?
My husband needs me.

290
00:18:10,569 --> 00:18:11,798
No, Ma'am. Thank you.

291
00:18:13,949 --> 00:18:15,135
How's he doing?

292
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,810
He'll live.

293
00:18:17,974 --> 00:18:20,502
They're going to bring him
out of sedation tomorrow.

294
00:18:20,627 --> 00:18:21,558
Excellent.

295
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:41,959
Why did you visit with Doyle Murphy?

296
00:18:42,084 --> 00:18:43,834
I didn't. He wasn't home.

297
00:18:45,804 --> 00:18:48,038
If he had been home,
what would you've said to him?

298
00:18:49,112 --> 00:18:50,503
"Give me my money."

299
00:18:50,814 --> 00:18:52,088
He owed you. How much?

300
00:18:52,553 --> 00:18:54,103
200 grand and change.

301
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,717
He comes out of incarceration

302
00:18:56,842 --> 00:18:58,928
this last bit he did
and needed to go into rehab.

303
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:02,474
Junkie son of a gun
was there over a month on my dime.

304
00:19:02,906 --> 00:19:04,476
That's very generous of you.

305
00:19:05,489 --> 00:19:06,939
What am I gonna do?

306
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:10,023
At the time, this was 2 years back,
he's married to my sister.

307
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,274
Moron.

308
00:19:11,511 --> 00:19:14,652
Then he kicks your sister to the curb
after some domestic violence problems.

309
00:19:14,777 --> 00:19:16,196
And he still owes you 200 grand.

310
00:19:17,016 --> 00:19:17,876
One,

311
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:19,851
my sister is a goblin shark.

312
00:19:19,976 --> 00:19:21,710
Freakin' Gandhi
would take a pop at her.

313
00:19:21,835 --> 00:19:24,120
I got no beef with Doyle over that,
believe me.

314
00:19:24,595 --> 00:19:25,504
And two,

315
00:19:25,661 --> 00:19:27,261
this money is what I'm telling ya.

316
00:19:27,386 --> 00:19:29,436
Why'd I kill a guy
who owes me that much money?

317
00:19:29,561 --> 00:19:31,287
Because he just made
a very big score.

318
00:19:31,412 --> 00:19:33,115
- Is that right?
- Yes, it is.

319
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,948
Maybe you decided to take
what's owed you, and a little bit more.

320
00:19:36,614 --> 00:19:39,268
- What score is this? Doverton's?
- You heard about that.

321
00:19:39,393 --> 00:19:41,180
Was on the TV. Nice work.

322
00:19:41,826 --> 00:19:43,076
Doyle did that?

323
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,309
Did you ever own a Beretta 950?

324
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,235
As a matter of fact,
I did use to have one of those.

325
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,647
I didn't like the balance.

326
00:19:51,337 --> 00:19:53,037
<i>I sold it to Doyle. Why?</i>

327
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,331
- Well...
- I don't care what you're gonna say.

328
00:19:59,456 --> 00:20:00,657
I like him for it.

329
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,325
Why, you don't care?

330
00:20:02,662 --> 00:20:04,877
He's obvious,
so you're gonna say he's not the guy,

331
00:20:05,002 --> 00:20:06,759
Because that would be boring.

332
00:20:06,884 --> 00:20:09,550
No, he looks good for it,
superficially, at least.

333
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:11,934
I was merely to say
and we need to find out the links,

334
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:14,963
between him and Doyle
and someone inside Doverton's.

335
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:17,196
I thought Carl Ward
was your man on the inside.

336
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:18,591
I noted

337
00:20:19,055 --> 00:20:21,928
that he was a tennis pro
and extrapolated from there.

338
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:23,596
No, you said he was the guy.

339
00:20:24,061 --> 00:20:25,466
- If you recall...
- Guys.

340
00:20:25,941 --> 00:20:29,046
I mean, boss. I think I found the link
you're talking about.

341
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:31,677
The old footage
from the store's security cameras

342
00:20:31,802 --> 00:20:33,358
is saved on a hard drive off-site.

343
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:35,513
I figured if Murphy
had been casing the store,

344
00:20:35,638 --> 00:20:37,357
I could find him on the old footage.

345
00:20:39,853 --> 00:20:40,853
Who's that?

346
00:20:40,979 --> 00:20:41,948
I'll enhance it.

347
00:20:46,475 --> 00:20:47,625
Tom Doverton.

348
00:20:53,205 --> 00:20:54,605
It's a customer...

349
00:20:54,976 --> 00:20:56,796
I guess.
I'm talking to a customer.

350
00:20:58,033 --> 00:21:00,800
That's the man who robbed
your family's store and shot your uncle.

351
00:21:01,213 --> 00:21:02,635
Sure you don't know him?

352
00:21:02,858 --> 00:21:04,846
'Cause you're talking
like you're old friends.

353
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,767
I'm just helping a customer
with their purchase.

354
00:21:08,961 --> 00:21:09,961
That's all.

355
00:21:11,412 --> 00:21:13,633
And you've never seen
that man before?

356
00:21:14,878 --> 00:21:17,086
And you don't know the name
"Doyle Murphy"?

357
00:21:21,991 --> 00:21:24,032
The kid's aunt and brother
are here with a lawyer.

358
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,367
Darn. We haven't gotten
anywhere with him yet.

359
00:21:26,746 --> 00:21:28,096
You want me to stall 'em?

360
00:21:28,221 --> 00:21:31,556
It's best just to cut him loose.
He's denying everything anyway.

361
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,374
Unless we can make some
connection to Culpepper and Doyle,

362
00:21:34,499 --> 00:21:36,008
we've got nothing to hold him on.

363
00:21:37,378 --> 00:21:40,287
You go and ask Culpepper about Tom.
I'll deal with the family.

364
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:54,479
You can take Tom home now.
We just need to question him.

365
00:21:55,061 --> 00:21:56,105
What questions?

366
00:21:56,631 --> 00:21:58,608
I'm sure he'll fill you in
on the details.

367
00:21:59,905 --> 00:22:02,028
I'd appreciate it
if next time you wish

368
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:03,780
to speak To a member of my family,

369
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:05,348
you call me first.

370
00:22:06,579 --> 00:22:09,243
I'm sorry, ma'am.
That's not our practice.

371
00:22:11,308 --> 00:22:13,039
Can I walk you to the elevator?

372
00:22:18,572 --> 00:22:20,824
You do know why
I'm letting you go, don't you?

373
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,423
Let me guess...

374
00:22:22,795 --> 00:22:23,716
I'm innocent.

375
00:22:25,727 --> 00:22:27,261
No, I figured you're stupid.

376
00:22:28,592 --> 00:22:29,514
Is that so?

377
00:22:30,757 --> 00:22:33,047
Either you really didn't know
that Doyle was gonna

378
00:22:33,172 --> 00:22:35,478
rob the jewelry store,
stupid innocent...

379
00:22:35,859 --> 00:22:38,064
Or you did know
and you're gonna lead us to a clue...

380
00:22:38,748 --> 00:22:39,948
Stupid guilty.

381
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:44,028
You should be more careful
how you talk to people.

382
00:22:44,317 --> 00:22:46,517
Yeah, figure I'm pretty safe here.

383
00:22:47,183 --> 00:22:48,408
What are you gonna do?

384
00:22:49,756 --> 00:22:51,369
You think I care where we are?

385
00:22:54,568 --> 00:22:55,568
Go ahead.

386
00:22:55,913 --> 00:22:57,940
Do something,
you miserable little sadist.

387
00:22:58,752 --> 00:22:59,711
Hello, Lisbon.

388
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:00,837
Hi, Dovertons.

389
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:03,965
- What's going on, Jane?
- I'm just letting Mr. Culpepper go.

390
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:06,000
We don't need him
for anything, do we?

391
00:23:07,571 --> 00:23:09,914
Sometime, when you least expect it,

392
00:23:11,275 --> 00:23:12,475
I'll find you.

393
00:23:16,025 --> 00:23:18,146
- You...
- We'll wait for the next one.

394
00:23:18,389 --> 00:23:19,389
All right.

395
00:23:20,466 --> 00:23:21,567
So long, partner.

396
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:22,842
Happy trails.

397
00:23:25,724 --> 00:23:27,363
Okay, what the hell was that?

398
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,901
- What was what?
- Letting Donny Culpepper go.

399
00:23:30,026 --> 00:23:32,871
You've no right whatsoever
to make those kind of decisions.

400
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:35,734
You weren't gonna keep him here,
on what? For what?

401
00:23:35,859 --> 00:23:37,707
He wasn't gonna talk. Be honest.

402
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,935
I could have held him
on the weapons charge.

403
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,430
- Please...
- Stop.

404
00:23:41,555 --> 00:23:43,179
There's principle involved.

405
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,506
I know what you're doing.

406
00:23:46,221 --> 00:23:47,383
What do you mean?

407
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,273
Showing the Dovertons
to Donny Culpepper.

408
00:23:49,398 --> 00:23:51,763
You wanted to see
if he recognized one of them.

409
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:53,891
You watch too much tv.
There was no reason

410
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:55,349
to keep Donny Culpepper here.

411
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:58,936
That's annoying. You're not even putting
any effort into the lie.

412
00:23:59,386 --> 00:24:02,273
Hey, boss. Coroner's here.
She's got something to show us.

413
00:24:09,903 --> 00:24:11,499
That's really beautiful.

414
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,328
I found it in Doyle Murphy's
lower intestine.

415
00:24:16,392 --> 00:24:18,384
My supposition
is that he swallowed it

416
00:24:18,572 --> 00:24:20,517
in an attempt to get
a larger share of the loot

417
00:24:20,642 --> 00:24:22,434
before it was divided
with any partners.

418
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,702
I guess Murphy misread
that situation?

419
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:27,292
Did you find
anything surprising other than that?

420
00:24:27,417 --> 00:24:28,417
Just that.

421
00:24:30,924 --> 00:24:32,220
What the hell was that?

422
00:24:36,456 --> 00:24:38,267
Had a hunch that it was a fake.

423
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,270
Guess I'm wrong about that.

424
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:44,440
Where is it?

425
00:24:44,738 --> 00:24:46,843
Well, the good news is
it's not out there.

426
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,757
So it's in here somewhere.

427
00:24:48,882 --> 00:24:49,808
I'll find it.

428
00:24:51,194 --> 00:24:52,686
Anyone see a little...

429
00:25:00,941 --> 00:25:04,252
There's gotta be a connection
between D. Murphy and T. Doverton.

430
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,594
What was it?

431
00:25:05,808 --> 00:25:08,381
- What would bring those 2 together?
- They've nothing in common.

432
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,408
- What are you looking for?
- A diamond.

433
00:25:10,533 --> 00:25:12,814
- What'd he do?
- Hit it with a fire extinguisher.

434
00:25:12,939 --> 00:25:14,580
- Of course.
- I got it!

435
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,678
Oh, thank god. Where was it?

436
00:25:16,803 --> 00:25:20,017
No, I got where Doyle and Tom connect.
Doyle was in rehab

437
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:23,271
and Tom Doverton does look
the rehab type.

438
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:25,955
Find out where Doyle went to rehab.

439
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,230
Keep looking.

440
00:25:27,486 --> 00:25:29,663
Don't worry.
This is the justice department.

441
00:25:29,788 --> 00:25:32,275
- Who's gonna steal it here?
- You be quiet!

442
00:25:41,481 --> 00:25:43,883
Windward Clarity
has the highest ratio

443
00:25:44,008 --> 00:25:46,297
of staff-to-patient
of any facility in the state.

444
00:25:46,898 --> 00:25:49,351
Our philosophy mixes
traditional western practices

445
00:25:49,603 --> 00:25:51,937
with spiritual aspects of the east.

446
00:25:53,257 --> 00:25:55,658
May I ask which one of you
needs our help.

447
00:25:55,783 --> 00:25:56,972
Or is it both?

448
00:25:57,371 --> 00:25:58,994
- We just wanted...
- It's her.

449
00:25:59,909 --> 00:26:01,184
Darling, please.

450
00:26:01,398 --> 00:26:03,186
Can we just this once do it my way?

451
00:26:03,354 --> 00:26:04,354
Just once?

452
00:26:05,139 --> 00:26:06,048
Thank you.

453
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:09,030
In the beginning
it was just social, but

454
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:11,615
more recently,

455
00:26:12,741 --> 00:26:14,557
It's been starting
to worry both of us.

456
00:26:15,096 --> 00:26:16,346
Right, darling?

457
00:26:18,232 --> 00:26:19,243
Right this way.

458
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,412
I'll introduce you
to one of our specialists.

459
00:26:21,706 --> 00:26:22,706
Fantastic.

460
00:26:24,436 --> 00:26:26,792
That's the office.
I'm gonna have to take this.

461
00:26:26,917 --> 00:26:29,409
Baby, you go ahead, take a look.
I'll be 5 minutes.

462
00:26:29,534 --> 00:26:30,727
I'll be right there.

463
00:26:30,852 --> 00:26:32,102
Look after her.

464
00:26:33,037 --> 00:26:34,363
I'm very proud of you.

465
00:26:34,871 --> 00:26:37,121
- I understand your nervousness.
- I love you.

466
00:27:32,407 --> 00:27:35,266
Our kitchen is capable
of preparing food for any diet.

467
00:27:35,391 --> 00:27:38,620
And of course, we have a pair
of on-site nutritionists.

468
00:27:40,748 --> 00:27:42,900
Your husband
is taking quite a long time.

469
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,102
You should understand,
he's not really my husband.

470
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:47,422
That's all right.

471
00:27:47,547 --> 00:27:49,580
We're not judgmental
about such things here.

472
00:27:50,462 --> 00:27:51,764
That's not what I mean.

473
00:27:57,552 --> 00:28:01,117
Uppers and downers. Uppers and...
You're so rock'n'roll, doctor.

474
00:28:01,961 --> 00:28:05,099
That is private material.
Doctor-patient privilege is sacrosanct.

475
00:28:05,461 --> 00:28:07,685
Yes, I know.
That's why we did it this way.

476
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:10,501
This is a murder investigation.
We can be as hard-ass as we want.

477
00:28:10,626 --> 00:28:11,522
I found it.

478
00:28:11,883 --> 00:28:14,775
The patient roster for the first 2 weeks
of Doyle Murphy's stay.

479
00:28:14,944 --> 00:28:18,362
Guess who his acting sponsor
was when he first arrived?

480
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,023
- Tom Doverton?
- No!

481
00:28:20,639 --> 00:28:22,408
- George.
- The brother?

482
00:28:23,892 --> 00:28:25,202
I'll call your superiors.

483
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,522
Lot of people say that to me,
you know what I say?

484
00:28:27,647 --> 00:28:28,873
- I say...
- Let's go.

485
00:28:29,601 --> 00:28:30,499
Come on.

486
00:28:34,433 --> 00:28:36,422
Get some help, doc.
That stuff will kill you.

487
00:28:46,014 --> 00:28:47,117
George isn't here.

488
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,072
He's already left.

489
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:51,287
He's not guilty, you know.

490
00:28:51,758 --> 00:28:54,919
- How'd you know we were coming?
- The director of the clinic called.

491
00:28:55,513 --> 00:28:56,971
He told us what you'd done.

492
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,423
George was in rehab
with Doyle Murphy,

493
00:29:00,548 --> 00:29:02,406
That's true,
but that's all that it was.

494
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:05,117
So you're saying if we dig,
we won't find any more contact

495
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:06,744
between George and Doyle?

496
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:08,079
He came into the store.

497
00:29:08,882 --> 00:29:10,956
A guy like that
at Doverton & Company?

498
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:13,584
Come on...
If my aunt found out...

499
00:29:13,977 --> 00:29:15,503
We need to talk to George.

500
00:29:15,672 --> 00:29:16,629
He's gone.

501
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:17,671
Really?

502
00:29:19,673 --> 00:29:21,342
I think he's hiding behind the door.

503
00:29:26,207 --> 00:29:27,807
George, come out.

504
00:29:38,968 --> 00:29:39,777
Sorry.

505
00:29:40,951 --> 00:29:42,238
You were trying to help,

506
00:29:43,452 --> 00:29:45,166
But we both know there's no

507
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:46,951
hiding from something like this.

508
00:29:51,869 --> 00:29:54,712
I had nothing to do with the robbery
or Doyle Murphy's murder.

509
00:29:54,837 --> 00:29:57,064
I only lied
to protect my aunt from...

510
00:29:58,071 --> 00:29:59,463
the shame of my addiction.

511
00:30:02,476 --> 00:30:06,261
Call Dicky Purcell.
Tell him to meet me at the CBI offices.

512
00:30:07,016 --> 00:30:08,016
After you.

513
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,084
Excuse me. Do you work here?

514
00:30:21,209 --> 00:30:23,556
Certainly, sir.
How can I help you?

515
00:30:23,967 --> 00:30:25,817
My wife, it's her birthday.

516
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,469
Of course.

517
00:30:28,531 --> 00:30:29,481
Michelle?

518
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,742
Michelle here would be happy
to help you.

519
00:30:32,613 --> 00:30:33,597
Mr. Doverton?

520
00:30:34,464 --> 00:30:35,875
I need a signature for this.

521
00:30:41,742 --> 00:30:42,673
There you go.

522
00:30:50,068 --> 00:30:52,057
"You'll get a call in 2 hours.

523
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:54,128
"Take the jewels where you are told.

524
00:30:55,131 --> 00:30:56,040
"No cops

525
00:30:56,379 --> 00:30:57,563
"or your aunt dies."

526
00:31:08,204 --> 00:31:09,254
She's gone.

527
00:31:12,199 --> 00:31:14,455
Why would anybody
kidnap aunt Esther?

528
00:31:14,815 --> 00:31:17,791
Someone thinks your brother
was partners with Doyle Murphy.

529
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,834
You think so.
Why shouldn't everyone else?

530
00:31:19,959 --> 00:31:21,060
Donny Culpepper.

531
00:31:22,004 --> 00:31:22,963
Who's he?

532
00:31:23,155 --> 00:31:25,212
You saw him
when we were waiting for the elevator.

533
00:31:25,337 --> 00:31:27,119
Doyle Murphy owed him
a lot of money.

534
00:31:27,244 --> 00:31:29,803
He might think
that debt transfers with the diamonds.

535
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,889
- We don't have them.
- He doesn't know that.

536
00:31:32,405 --> 00:31:34,183
You've to go arrest him right away.

537
00:31:34,479 --> 00:31:36,268
That's what we're trying to do.

538
00:31:37,361 --> 00:31:39,904
Agent Van Pelt is working
with local police as we speak.

539
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:41,649
We're pursuing several leads.

540
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,400
But the note says no police.

541
00:31:43,843 --> 00:31:45,446
It's a little late for that.

542
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,906
So? How are you gonna get
our aunt back?

543
00:31:49,075 --> 00:31:51,218
We'll do everything we can
to find her.

544
00:31:51,823 --> 00:31:53,872
In the meantime,
when the kidnappers call,

545
00:31:53,997 --> 00:31:55,621
you've to try and stall them.

546
00:31:59,129 --> 00:32:00,129
Take that.

547
00:32:15,736 --> 00:32:18,536
- It's almost time. You ready?
- Yeah, ready.

548
00:32:18,825 --> 00:32:19,734
And you?

549
00:32:20,332 --> 00:32:21,382
I don't know.

550
00:32:22,715 --> 00:32:23,790
Just stay calm.

551
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,038
Keep the kidnapper on the line
and keep him calm.

552
00:32:27,163 --> 00:32:29,577
Remember,
keep going as long as you can, okay?

553
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,126
- Headphones?
- Yeah, other room.

554
00:32:38,447 --> 00:32:39,416
Here we go.

555
00:32:45,871 --> 00:32:46,780
Hello?

556
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,290
<i>Do you have the jewels ready?</i>

557
00:32:53,402 --> 00:32:55,265
How do I know you have my aunt?

558
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:56,974
I demand to...

559
00:32:57,564 --> 00:33:00,144
<i>You don't demand anything.
You shut up and you listen.</i>

560
00:33:01,011 --> 00:33:01,972
I'm sorry.

561
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,636
<i>- I just need proof before...
- Proof?</i>

562
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:07,526
<i>I'll give you proof.</i>

563
00:33:07,915 --> 00:33:09,047
<i>Hello? George?</i>

564
00:33:11,013 --> 00:33:12,865
<i>- Are you all right?
- There.</i>

565
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:14,166
<i>That's your proof.</i>

566
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:17,101
<i>If you want to see her alive again,</i>

567
00:33:17,226 --> 00:33:18,454
<i>bring me the diamonds.</i>

568
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,098
- I can't do that.
- Got it.

569
00:33:24,223 --> 00:33:25,973
<i>You think this is a game?</i>

570
00:33:27,012 --> 00:33:27,838
I'm sorry.

571
00:33:28,257 --> 00:33:30,472
<i>Are you gonna give me the jewels?</i>

572
00:33:31,736 --> 00:33:34,174
I don't have the jewels.
I'm trying to tell you.

573
00:33:34,299 --> 00:33:35,599
<i>All right, then.</i>

574
00:33:36,157 --> 00:33:37,552
<i>This is your decision.</i>

575
00:33:39,297 --> 00:33:40,271
Aunt Esther.

576
00:33:41,361 --> 00:33:42,355
<i>You're next.</i>

577
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:44,773
<i>Now I'm coming for you.</i>

578
00:33:46,412 --> 00:33:47,394
Oh, my god.

579
00:33:51,942 --> 00:33:53,161
Stay right there.

580
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:20,088
Hello?

581
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,292
<i>Where are the jewels, Tom?</i>

582
00:34:22,763 --> 00:34:24,513
<i>We both know you have'em.</i>

583
00:34:24,911 --> 00:34:26,637
They're going to catch you.

584
00:34:26,762 --> 00:34:28,482
They're going to get you right now.

585
00:34:31,196 --> 00:34:32,734
<i>I'm gonna get you, Tom.</i>

586
00:34:33,941 --> 00:34:35,723
<i>I know everything about you.</i>

587
00:34:36,583 --> 00:34:38,492
<i>Doyle Murphy told me everything.</i>

588
00:34:39,391 --> 00:34:40,391
Screw you.

589
00:34:41,594 --> 00:34:43,328
I'll give you $50,000,

590
00:34:44,205 --> 00:34:46,562
50 grand to leave me
and my brother alone.

591
00:34:47,394 --> 00:34:49,231
<i>You think you're so tough.</i>

592
00:34:49,356 --> 00:34:52,589
<i>You give me what I want,
or I will come and take it from you.</i>

593
00:34:53,031 --> 00:34:54,581
I'll make it $75,000,

594
00:34:54,908 --> 00:34:55,934
but no more.

595
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:58,378
<i>I'm not giving up the diamonds.</i>

596
00:34:58,603 --> 00:35:00,549
You stupid, rich brat.

597
00:35:02,374 --> 00:35:04,419
You think you can dictate terms?

598
00:35:05,071 --> 00:35:06,061
Not this time.

599
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:08,506
<i>Not this time.</i>

600
00:35:08,631 --> 00:35:10,231
<i>I'm gonna make you pay</i>

601
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,450
<i>- and pay.
- You try it.</i>

602
00:35:13,572 --> 00:35:15,320
You try it,
and you see what happens.

603
00:35:16,621 --> 00:35:17,728
Tough guy, huh?

604
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:20,993
You're gonna give me
the same thing that D. Murphy?

605
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,430
<i>That's right.</i>

606
00:35:23,655 --> 00:35:26,087
<i>You push me hard enough,
and you'll see.</i>

607
00:35:28,991 --> 00:35:30,791
Thanks, Tom. That's great.

608
00:35:31,807 --> 00:35:33,079
Got it all on tape.

609
00:35:33,204 --> 00:35:34,965
You're going down.
Give me the phone.

610
00:35:35,445 --> 00:35:36,967
<i>Hands behind your back.</i>

611
00:35:37,589 --> 00:35:40,215
<i>You're under arrest
for the murder of Doyle Murphy.</i>

612
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,070
<i>Let's go.</i>

613
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:48,190
Like a charm.

614
00:35:53,641 --> 00:35:54,526
Tea.

615
00:35:55,017 --> 00:35:55,926
Lovely.

616
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:01,767
Ms. Doverton?

617
00:36:03,316 --> 00:36:04,203
I'm sorry,

618
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:07,080
but we've had to mislead you a little
to solve this crime.

619
00:36:10,095 --> 00:36:12,085
I'm afraid I've got
some difficult news.

620
00:36:12,855 --> 00:36:15,563
Your nephew, Tom,
was involved in this robbery.

621
00:36:57,625 --> 00:36:59,325
Hey, Carl. Welcome back.

622
00:37:02,402 --> 00:37:04,137
- Where am I?
- In the hospital.

623
00:37:05,236 --> 00:37:07,575
You just came out
of an induced coma.

624
00:37:07,989 --> 00:37:10,615
- Can I ask you a question?
- What happened to me?

625
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:12,767
- Who are you?
- Never mind that.

626
00:37:12,892 --> 00:37:13,801
Tell me,

627
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:15,607
Esther Doverton

628
00:37:17,371 --> 00:37:19,121
It was all a scam, right?

629
00:37:19,996 --> 00:37:22,531
You just wanted
to cash in with a rich, old broad.

630
00:37:23,086 --> 00:37:25,195
- Excuse me?
- Oh, come on.

631
00:37:25,803 --> 00:37:28,287
You don't need to be coy with me.
It was a great score.

632
00:37:29,022 --> 00:37:31,206
Plus, she's,
she's pretty good-looking,

633
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:33,667
Which is an added bonus
with these kind of scams.

634
00:37:34,905 --> 00:37:36,905
Are you talking about my wife?

635
00:37:37,516 --> 00:37:38,922
Who do you think you are?

636
00:37:39,198 --> 00:37:41,863
Wouldn't that be a better question
for me to ask you,

637
00:37:42,196 --> 00:37:43,296
Mr. Wysocki?

638
00:37:45,852 --> 00:37:46,680
That's it.

639
00:37:47,009 --> 00:37:48,509
Had to end sometime.

640
00:37:49,135 --> 00:37:50,503
You had a pretty good run.

641
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:53,259
Between you and me,
I think you could squeeze

642
00:37:53,384 --> 00:37:55,429
a little more nickel out of this
poor old bat.

643
00:37:55,554 --> 00:37:58,690
- What do you think?
- Don't you talk about her like that.

644
00:37:59,184 --> 00:38:02,012
That woman is the only good thing
that's ever happened to me.

645
00:38:02,137 --> 00:38:03,070
I love her.

646
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:06,241
- You sure?
- Shut up and get out of here,

647
00:38:06,453 --> 00:38:08,076
- you son of a...
- All right. Gotcha.

648
00:38:14,872 --> 00:38:16,280
Told you he loves you.

649
00:38:23,314 --> 00:38:24,801
You trying to kill yourself?

650
00:38:25,264 --> 00:38:27,814
I'm so sorry.
I never meant to hurt you.

651
00:38:54,175 --> 00:38:56,579
A long time ago,
that might have been a frog

652
00:38:56,835 --> 00:39:00,295
or a fern or a dinosaur.
Then it died, turned into coal...

653
00:39:00,723 --> 00:39:02,880
I know.
I did first grade geology, too.

654
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,349
I'm just saying,

655
00:39:05,052 --> 00:39:07,348
just compressed carbon to me.
If you want to keep it,

656
00:39:07,473 --> 00:39:09,169
- I never saw a thing.
- What?

657
00:39:09,294 --> 00:39:11,848
Get outta here.
I wasn't even thinking about that.

658
00:39:12,548 --> 00:39:13,976
Well, if you say so.

659
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:16,812
Seriously, you'd let me just
walk out of here with this?

660
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,288
- Do you want to?
- No.

661
00:39:19,413 --> 00:39:21,358
Of course not.
I mean, yes, I'm tempted.

662
00:39:21,594 --> 00:39:23,193
Then., put it in your pocket.

663
00:39:24,282 --> 00:39:26,440
- This is a trap, isn't it?
- Are you nuts?

664
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:30,107
- What do I care about your integrity?
- Oh yeah, trap.

665
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:32,681
Okay.

666
00:39:40,007 --> 00:39:41,670
Rigsby put something in your pocket.

667
00:39:42,367 --> 00:39:43,276
What?

668
00:39:55,723 --> 00:39:57,101
He's messing with you.

669
00:39:59,192 --> 00:40:00,729
It's compressed carbon.

670
00:40:00,854 --> 00:40:02,341
If you want to keep it...

671
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:04,317
I don't know about Rigsby but,

672
00:40:05,856 --> 00:40:07,430
I wouldn't tell a soul.
