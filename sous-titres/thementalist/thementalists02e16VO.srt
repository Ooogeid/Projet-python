1
00:01:30,533 --> 00:01:33,568
I daresay you've inspected
more modern facilities

2
00:01:33,602 --> 00:01:35,701
in your travels, but, uh--

3
00:01:35,736 --> 00:01:39,339
Griffin.
Don't come in here.

4
00:01:39,373 --> 00:01:41,208
Dr. Seberg, what's wrong?

5
00:01:45,315 --> 00:01:47,846
Oh, my God.

6
00:02:04,955 --> 00:02:07,256
Hey.

7
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,957
Hey.

8
00:02:08,992 --> 00:02:11,193
Cheer up.
Why?

9
00:02:11,227 --> 00:02:13,995
Uh, 'cause it's better
to be happy than sad.

10
00:02:14,029 --> 00:02:16,063
I'm not sad.
You're very sad.

11
00:02:16,097 --> 00:02:18,266
You've been sad for months,
ever since, uh--

12
00:02:18,276 --> 00:02:19,976
what, is this some sort
of therapy session?

13
00:02:20,001 --> 00:02:22,468
Did you bring tissue
in case you make me cry?

14
00:02:22,503 --> 00:02:25,037
There we go. Zing of anger--
gets the blood up.

15
00:02:25,071 --> 00:02:26,673
That's a good start.
Is this what you came here for--
to zing me?

16
00:02:26,707 --> 00:02:28,176
Because I've got
paperwork to do.

17
00:02:28,286 --> 00:02:31,786
Jane, call for you. They say
it's extremely urgent. Line two.

18
00:02:31,811 --> 00:02:34,012
Ooh.

19
00:02:35,647 --> 00:02:37,815
this is Jane.

20
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,784
good morning, Mr. Jane.

21
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:42,487
My name is Dr. Alicia Seberg.

22
00:02:42,522 --> 00:02:44,924
I gather from a brief search
on the internet

23
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:47,526
that you're the best Detective
in my immediate vicinity.

24
00:02:47,561 --> 00:02:48,928
Oh. Well, um...

25
00:02:48,962 --> 00:02:52,631
you flatter me, but, uh,
I'm not actually a Detective.

26
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:54,199
I need
your professional assistance.

27
00:02:54,234 --> 00:02:55,801
Please come immediately.

28
00:02:55,835 --> 00:02:57,602
I've been murdered.

Whoo!

32
00:03:40,598 --> 00:03:43,433
That was fun!

33
00:03:43,468 --> 00:03:45,034
Whoo!

34
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:49,003
Agent Lisbon! CBI!

35
00:03:49,038 --> 00:03:51,238
Ma'am, sir,
please follow me.

36
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:52,539
All right!

37
00:03:52,573 --> 00:03:55,274
Agent Lisbon.
And you are...

38
00:03:55,308 --> 00:03:57,309
I'm this guy--
Patrick Jane. Consultant?

39
00:03:57,343 --> 00:04:00,344
Okay, Teresa, Patrick,
glad to meet you both.

40
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:02,813
I'm Dean Harken, California
Disease Control Authority.

41
00:04:02,847 --> 00:04:05,048
Nice to meet you.
Yeah, we have

42
00:04:05,082 --> 00:04:07,550
a potential code red
virus outbreak situation here.

43
00:04:07,584 --> 00:04:10,185
This facility
is under C.D.C.A. control,

44
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:12,220
as per
state emergency protocols.

45
00:04:12,254 --> 00:04:15,057
Thousands of people might die if
we don't get this right, okay?

46
00:04:15,091 --> 00:04:18,263
We've been apprised of the basic--
Now she's denying it, of course,
but this situation's

47
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:20,733
almost certainly resulted
from an error by Dr. Seberg.

48
00:04:20,767 --> 00:04:22,336
There's no criminality
involved,

49
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,439
so you're not really
needed here.

50
00:04:23,549 --> 00:04:24,469
Probably
but we're gonna have--

51
00:04:24,574 --> 00:04:26,809
As a professional courtesy, I'm
gonna let you into the facility.

52
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,215
I'm happy for you guys
to observe and gather evidence,

53
00:04:29,249 --> 00:04:32,217
as long as you remember
that C.D.C.A. Is big dog here.

54
00:04:32,252 --> 00:04:35,287
Our investigation has priority.
Now are we cool with that?

55
00:04:36,715 --> 00:04:37,748
Absolutely.

56
00:04:37,783 --> 00:04:39,983
Can I see
your I.D. also?

57
00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:42,285
Sure.

58
00:04:43,788 --> 00:04:47,325
Thank you... Dean.

59
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:51,028
No picture. That's a shame.
You're a good-looking man.

60
00:04:51,063 --> 00:04:53,630
Scott Price,
I manage this facility

61
00:04:53,665 --> 00:04:55,098
for Zitek
Biosystems division.

62
00:04:55,132 --> 00:04:56,900
Right off the bat,
let me assure you

63
00:04:56,934 --> 00:04:58,436
that we as a company are
110% committed to giving you

64
00:04:58,446 --> 00:04:59,566
the best possible cooperation.

65
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:03,805
Thank you, Mr. Price. Shall we?
There's a sense of urgency here.

66
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,974
Ah, yes, of course.

67
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:09,444
Lisbon, Jane, Dr. Edmunds,
head of research here.

68
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:11,513
He'll take you
to the release incident.

69
00:05:11,547 --> 00:05:14,082
Price, come with me.

70
00:05:14,116 --> 00:05:16,117
Thank you for coming
so quickly.

71
00:05:16,151 --> 00:05:18,552
What exactly is it
that you do here?

72
00:05:18,586 --> 00:05:20,086
Biowarfare.
With modern technology,

73
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,655
Anthrax, botulism,
bubonic plague,

74
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:25,456
even cobra venom all he
strong weaponizing potential.

75
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,025
It's a growing field.
A lot of exciting developments.

76
00:05:28,059 --> 00:05:30,694
You develop ways of killing
people in large numbers.

77
00:05:30,728 --> 00:05:33,196
To the contrary. We develop
antidotes, ways to combat

78
00:05:33,231 --> 00:05:35,431
the things that kill
large numbers of people.

79
00:05:35,465 --> 00:05:36,865
Here we are.

80
00:05:42,638 --> 00:05:44,338
Follow me.

81
00:05:47,275 --> 00:05:49,609
120.

82
00:05:49,644 --> 00:05:52,945
Darling. Is this Mr. Jane?

83
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:55,813
Yes. How are you feeling?
The same.

84
00:05:55,847 --> 00:05:57,748
Interesting improvement
in cardiac rate, though.

85
00:05:57,783 --> 00:06:01,519
My metabolism's trying to
fight back with adrenaline.

86
00:06:01,553 --> 00:06:03,554
Good morning, Mr. Jane.

87
00:06:03,588 --> 00:06:05,422
Hi.

88
00:06:05,456 --> 00:06:07,523
Agent Lisbon, CBI.

89
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:11,293
You mind running this down
for us?

90
00:06:11,328 --> 00:06:15,063
Someone opened this flask
and left it under the tank.

91
00:06:15,097 --> 00:06:18,465
It contains an airborne form
of cryptohansa b strain.

92
00:06:18,499 --> 00:06:20,766
It's
an engineered supervirus.

93
00:06:20,801 --> 00:06:23,535
If it escaped from this room,
it would kill

94
00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:25,870
every vertebrate creature
within a quarter-mile radius.

95
00:06:25,904 --> 00:06:29,039
It attacks the red blood cells,
gradually stops them

96
00:06:29,074 --> 00:06:30,975
from delivering oxygen.

97
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:33,410
The victim... dies from
suffocation or a heart attack,

98
00:06:33,444 --> 00:06:35,545
depending on
their physical condition.

99
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:37,346
How long after exposure?

100
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,181
We estimate anywhere
from two to six hours.

101
00:06:40,216 --> 00:06:44,250
So you could die at any time?
Yes.

102
00:06:44,285 --> 00:06:46,651
Harken says you did this
yourself--tragic error.

103
00:06:46,686 --> 00:06:49,721
He's a bureaucrat. He's looking
for the easy answer.

104
00:06:49,755 --> 00:06:52,124
It takes four distinct steps
to remove a cap

105
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:55,060
from one of these flasks,
and we never open a flask

106
00:06:55,094 --> 00:06:57,597
outside of the tank.
That's just basic.

107
00:06:57,631 --> 00:07:01,468
I can assure you both,
I had nothing to do with this.

108
00:07:01,502 --> 00:07:04,671
But this was no mistake.
Whoever did this wanted me dead.

109
00:07:04,705 --> 00:07:06,872
Everybody knows I take
the first shift.

110
00:07:06,907 --> 00:07:10,375
She called you "darling."
you both have wedding bands.

111
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:12,110
You husband and wife?

112
00:07:12,145 --> 00:07:14,345
Yes.

113
00:07:15,648 --> 00:07:17,415
Well, she looks surprised

114
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:20,251
because you seem
incredibly calm and cool

115
00:07:20,285 --> 00:07:21,919
for a man whose wife
is dying.

116
00:07:21,953 --> 00:07:25,488
How would an absence of calm
and cool be useful to her?

117
00:07:25,523 --> 00:07:27,624
Good point.
Correct me if I'm wrong,

118
00:07:27,658 --> 00:07:29,759
but for the killer to open
the flask,

119
00:07:29,793 --> 00:07:32,227
they would have to expose
themselves to the virus,

120
00:07:32,261 --> 00:07:35,564
which case, they would be
dying or possibly dead already.

121
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:37,966
No, there's an antidote.

122
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,134
It's an enzyme compound.

123
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,936
If taken before exposure,
it prevents infection.

124
00:07:42,971 --> 00:07:45,371
I assume whoever did this
took a dose.

125
00:07:45,406 --> 00:07:48,641
Couldn't you j--
no, I can't take it now.

126
00:07:48,675 --> 00:07:52,544
The antidote only works if taken
<i>before</i> exposure, as I said.

127
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:55,380
Why didn't you take it before,
just as a precaution?

128
00:07:55,414 --> 00:07:58,516
The side effects of regular use
are far too severe.

129
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,551
Who else had access
to the virus flask?

130
00:08:00,585 --> 00:08:03,120
The only people allowed
in the lab are Cliff and I,

131
00:08:03,154 --> 00:08:05,522
Welks, Nash and Tripp,
our colleagues.

132
00:08:05,556 --> 00:08:08,024
We have a state-of-the-art
biometric security system,

133
00:08:08,058 --> 00:08:09,458
as you can see.

134
00:08:09,493 --> 00:08:12,461
So your husband
or one of the three colleagues

135
00:08:12,495 --> 00:08:14,596
is the killer.

136
00:08:15,665 --> 00:08:18,866
Sorry. Uh, <i>will</i> be the killer.

137
00:08:18,901 --> 00:08:20,668
Jane.

138
00:08:20,702 --> 00:08:22,236
I'm just... Mm.

139
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:26,806
That's all right. That is
the unavoidable conclusion.

140
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,674
Yes.

141
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,742
Where are
the other three now?

142
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:32,312
Harken is having them
fill out an accident report.

143
00:08:32,322 --> 00:08:34,222
We're gonna need to speak
to them.

144
00:08:34,446 --> 00:08:36,881
Ooh, this is
a good one, eh?

145
00:08:36,915 --> 00:08:38,682
Good?

146
00:08:38,717 --> 00:08:40,818
Well, interesting. Unique.

147
00:08:40,852 --> 00:08:44,822
If you're a jaded, ghoulish
adventure seeker.

148
00:08:44,856 --> 00:08:47,323
Ghoulish? Listen, if people
are gonna kill each other

149
00:08:47,358 --> 00:08:49,825
and we have to catch them,
I would much rather

150
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,360
they go about it with
some kind of originality.

151
00:08:52,394 --> 00:08:54,027
boss?
Hey, Van Pelt.

152
00:08:54,062 --> 00:08:56,396
I need you to do background
checks on Cliff Edmunds...

153
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,465
Lilith Nash,
Griffin Latimer Welks,

154
00:08:59,499 --> 00:09:00,966
Florian Eric Tripp.

155
00:09:01,001 --> 00:09:02,735
I'm sending you
their details now.

156
00:09:02,769 --> 00:09:05,804
Anything to be
looking out for in particular?

157
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:07,972
Oh, uh, one of them released
a lethal supervirus.

158
00:09:08,007 --> 00:09:10,007
that could kill half
the state of California,

159
00:09:10,042 --> 00:09:11,542
So I guess we're looking for

160
00:09:11,576 --> 00:09:14,344
someone with a prior background
as an evil supervillain.

161
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:15,912
Okay.

162
00:09:17,915 --> 00:09:21,016
That last part was a joke.
Yeah, we get it.

163
00:09:21,051 --> 00:09:22,651
Later.

164
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,460
Hello.

165
00:09:33,494 --> 00:09:34,561
Hi.

166
00:09:34,595 --> 00:09:36,096
Hello.
Hello.

167
00:09:46,305 --> 00:09:49,607
What are you doin'?
What does it look like
I'm doing?

168
00:09:49,641 --> 00:09:54,010
Trying to make us nervous?
Correct. How am I doing?

169
00:09:54,045 --> 00:09:56,613
Doing well.
Excellent.

170
00:09:56,647 --> 00:09:58,614
But why?

171
00:09:58,649 --> 00:10:01,283
One of you three
murdered Alicia Seberg,

172
00:10:01,317 --> 00:10:05,220
or her husband did.
It's our job to find out who.
And we're in a hurry,

173
00:10:05,254 --> 00:10:09,390
And nervous people
are easy to read.
And what do you gather
from all this reading?

174
00:10:09,424 --> 00:10:11,591
Well, you're an open book.
You're exactly what

175
00:10:11,626 --> 00:10:14,027
you seem to be--
a straight arrow, a boy scout.

176
00:10:14,061 --> 00:10:16,662
Am I right?
No.

177
00:10:16,697 --> 00:10:19,698
I'm wrong.
There's a hidden side to you.
Yes, but--

178
00:10:19,732 --> 00:10:21,800
What are you hiding?
Nothing.

179
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:23,835
What is he hiding, Lilith?
I don't know.

180
00:10:23,869 --> 00:10:25,703
What are <i>you</i> hidi?
I-I'm not--

181
00:10:25,737 --> 00:10:27,238
It was you, wasn't it?
Me what?

182
00:10:27,272 --> 00:10:30,306
You were having an affair
with Alicia Seberg.

183
00:10:30,341 --> 00:10:32,375
What? No, not with me.

184
00:10:32,409 --> 00:10:36,045
Not with you.
With who, then?

185
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,013
I oversee equipment
and inventory,

186
00:10:38,047 --> 00:10:40,315
not my colleagues'
private lives.

187
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:42,250
But she <i>was</i> having
an affair, huh?

188
00:10:42,284 --> 00:10:45,219
Why else would a husband
have the motives to kill her?

189
00:10:45,253 --> 00:10:48,321
And if it wasn't her husband,
it was one of you.

190
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,989
Who was it?

191
00:10:53,493 --> 00:10:55,227
My guess...

192
00:10:57,029 --> 00:10:58,963
Kaseem.

193
00:10:58,998 --> 00:11:00,932
Yes.

194
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,067
Does her husband know?
Oh, he knows.

195
00:11:03,101 --> 00:11:04,468
Dr. Edmunds

196
00:11:04,502 --> 00:11:07,037
A kind, gentle man.
He couldn't have done <i>this.</i>

197
00:11:07,071 --> 00:11:09,806
Thank you, Lilith, Florian...

198
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,574
Griffin.

199
00:11:20,515 --> 00:11:23,717
Why didn't you tell us you were
having an affair

200
00:11:23,752 --> 00:11:26,454
with Dr. Kaseem here?
Because it isn't relevant.

201
00:11:26,487 --> 00:11:29,055
Yeah, we have
an honest and open marriage.

202
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:30,356
They do.

203
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,224
Really?
You don't mind?

204
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:33,959
No, I don't mind at all.

205
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:35,861
Fidelity is sily
a cultural convention.

206
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:38,530
Like clothes
and not killing people.

207
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:40,665
You could say so.

208
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:44,167
Come on.
It must bug you a little.

209
00:11:44,202 --> 00:11:48,571
No. We love each other.
Her hainess is mine.

210
00:11:48,605 --> 00:11:51,807
It's not like I don't have
affairs myself.

211
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:54,542
Are you having an affair
presently?

212
00:11:54,577 --> 00:11:57,111
No. I've been far too busy.

213
00:11:57,145 --> 00:11:59,847
Y-you must think
this is a little weird.

214
00:11:59,881 --> 00:12:04,050
Uh... yeah... at first.

215
00:12:04,085 --> 00:12:05,952
But hey.

216
00:12:05,986 --> 00:12:07,386
But hey.

217
00:12:07,421 --> 00:12:10,856
What an eloquent phrase
that is.

218
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,494
Oh! Isabel. Thank God.

219
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,902
<i>Mom?</i>
<i>Mom, I got dad's message.</i>

220
00:12:26,937 --> 00:12:29,005
<i>Is it true?</i>

221
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,472
Yes, it's true.

222
00:12:30,507 --> 00:12:32,340
No.

223
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,808
<i>No, no, it can't be!</i>

224
00:12:33,843 --> 00:12:35,810
Oh, this is a pickle,
isn't it?

225
00:12:35,844 --> 00:12:39,312
Oh, baby, don't cry.
Don't cry.

226
00:12:39,346 --> 00:12:42,281
<i>How can you</i>
<i>tell me not to cry?</i>

227
00:12:42,315 --> 00:12:46,051
<i>Of course I'm going to cry.</i>
<i>Is there something you can do?</i>

228
00:12:46,085 --> 00:12:49,854
<i>There has to be something!</i>

229
00:12:49,889 --> 00:12:51,924
Listen to me.

230
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,859
We don't have much time,

231
00:12:53,893 --> 00:12:56,595
so we mustn't waste it
weeping and wailing, okay?

232
00:12:56,629 --> 00:12:58,430
<i>Okay.</i>
Good.

233
00:12:58,464 --> 00:13:03,067
How's school going? Did you get
your calculus grade up?

234
00:13:03,101 --> 00:13:05,669
<i>I got a 95 on my last test.</i>

235
00:13:05,703 --> 00:13:09,172
Oh, well done.
You keep that up.

236
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:13,308
A-and what about that boy, Andy?
How's that going?

237
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:17,178
<i>Oh, he's a jerk. </i>
<i>I don't see him anymore.</i>

238
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,680
Well, I must say,
I'm glad to hear that.

239
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:22,016
I didn't like
the sound of him.

240
00:13:27,822 --> 00:13:30,223
I love you so much.

241
00:13:30,257 --> 00:13:34,193
You're the best thing
I ever did.

242
00:13:34,227 --> 00:13:38,196
And I am so... Proud of you.

243
00:13:38,264 --> 00:13:40,698
<i>Mom.</i>

244
00:13:40,732 --> 00:13:42,099
Shh, shh, shh!

245
00:13:42,134 --> 00:13:44,668
When I'm gone,

246
00:13:44,702 --> 00:13:47,737
you mustn't waste time
being sad.

247
00:13:47,772 --> 00:13:52,308
A little while is okay,
but not too long.

248
00:13:52,342 --> 00:13:55,878
You be brave.

249
00:13:55,912 --> 00:13:57,879
And be happy.

250
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:03,117
Bye, baby.

251
00:14:03,151 --> 00:14:05,552
<i>Mom!</i>

252
00:14:05,587 --> 00:14:07,621
<i>Mom!</i>
Bye, baby.

253
00:14:07,655 --> 00:14:09,289
<i>No, mom!</i>

254
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,893
Good-bye, my love.

255
00:14:13,928 --> 00:14:16,329
I love you, darling.
Good-bye.

256
00:14:33,211 --> 00:14:34,777
She's gone, baby.

257
00:14:34,812 --> 00:14:36,512
She's gone.

258
00:14:52,246 --> 00:14:53,646
She's dead?

259
00:14:53,681 --> 00:14:55,315
yes.

260
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,851
I'm, uh...

261
00:15:01,042 --> 00:15:03,309
I'm sorry for your loss.

262
00:15:07,792 --> 00:15:09,859
My people and I will get prepped

263
00:15:09,893 --> 00:15:13,462
for the decontamination procedure.
How does that work?

264
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:16,198
It's a low-intensity
micro-radiation bath

265
00:15:16,232 --> 00:15:17,966
built in for this eventuality.

266
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,368
The chamber is irradiated.
The virus is destroyed.

267
00:15:20,402 --> 00:15:22,203
Alicia's body's not harmed.

268
00:15:21,715 --> 00:15:24,650
How long until we can examine
the crime scene?
Whoa.

269
00:15:24,684 --> 00:15:27,152
It's not a crime scene until
you know there's a crime, right?

270
00:15:27,186 --> 00:15:29,220
Well, you don't know
there's been a murder here.

271
00:15:29,254 --> 00:15:31,789
Where's your evidence?
Alicia's Seberg's word.

272
00:15:31,823 --> 00:15:34,558
Why would she lie?
She had a brain freeze.

273
00:15:34,592 --> 00:15:36,660
She screwed up,
and she can't admit the fact.

274
00:15:36,694 --> 00:15:39,629
It happens. I've been working
this beat for a long time.

275
00:15:39,663 --> 00:15:42,498
I've seen the same denial,
same certainty.

276
00:15:42,532 --> 00:15:44,666
It's human nature.
I disagree. I believe her.

277
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,468
I'm calling this in
as a homicide.

278
00:15:46,502 --> 00:15:48,436
And I'm sorry if this
complicates your work,

279
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:51,705
But it's my job.
That's fine. Okay.
Doing your job.

280
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,607
But this is still
a live outbreak,

281
00:15:53,641 --> 00:15:56,810
and I'm in charge here.
You wanna make a murder case,

282
00:15:56,844 --> 00:16:01,013
We'll deal with the suspects
as per C.D.C.A. protocols.

283
00:16:01,047 --> 00:16:02,847
Absolutely.

284
00:16:07,651 --> 00:16:10,152
Until the summer of '08,

285
00:16:10,186 --> 00:16:13,256
Seberg, Edmunds, Nash and Tripp
all worked together

286
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:15,493
at the Northern California
Technology Institute

287
00:16:15,527 --> 00:16:17,529
Biochemistry department.

288
00:16:17,563 --> 00:16:19,631
Seberg and Edmunds
left abruptly--

289
00:16:19,665 --> 00:16:21,565
some kind of legal dispute.

290
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,567
Okay, Cho and I
will check it out.

291
00:16:23,601 --> 00:16:26,136
Have you ever been convicted
of a criminal offense?

292
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:27,337
No.

293
00:16:27,371 --> 00:16:30,439
Are you now or have you
ever been a member

294
00:16:30,474 --> 00:16:32,007
of a terrorist organization?
This is ridiculous.

295
00:16:32,042 --> 00:16:35,177
This <i>is</i> ridiculous.
Just let it go.

296
00:16:35,211 --> 00:16:37,478
Let's have some quiet
back there, huh?

297
00:16:40,815 --> 00:16:42,816
Now, Mr. Tripp, please--
why?

298
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,484
Why?

299
00:16:44,518 --> 00:16:47,019
What difference
does our silence make?

300
00:16:47,054 --> 00:16:50,122
Silent or not, you're still
wasting everybody's time

301
00:16:50,156 --> 00:16:53,091
with this nonsense.
You guys called this homicide,
so now we have

302
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:56,027
to run the paperwork.
That's how it works.
Still a waste of time.

303
00:16:56,061 --> 00:16:58,897
I thought I made the deal
clear to you guys.

304
00:16:58,931 --> 00:17:03,234
You really wanna mess with the C.D.C.A.?
Absolutely not. I apologize
for my colleague's rudeness--

305
00:17:03,268 --> 00:17:05,068
No, she doesn't.
I retract that apology.

306
00:17:05,103 --> 00:17:07,671
Show some mettle, Lisbon.
You know as well as I do,

307
00:17:07,705 --> 00:17:10,273
if I have ten minutes
with these people,

308
00:17:10,307 --> 00:17:14,576
I will get the truth, if there's
any useful truth worth having.
Excuse us.

309
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:18,045
Yes, excuse us.
We have to have a chat.

310
00:17:19,514 --> 00:17:22,415
Cool it,
all right? That is an order.

311
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,884
Okay. Just relax.
I'm working the case.

312
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:28,020
Let me explain something to you.
Mm-hmm.

313
00:17:28,054 --> 00:17:29,988
This is politics.

314
00:17:30,022 --> 00:17:32,256
The C.D.C.A. is rich,
mean and well connected.

315
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,524
The CBI in comparison
are like poor orphans.

316
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,627
We can't make enemies
out of them.

317
00:17:36,661 --> 00:17:38,628
We need to cooperate
with this man.

318
00:17:38,662 --> 00:17:41,732
He irks me.
Say it. "I understand."

319
00:17:41,765 --> 00:17:44,133
Hmm.

320
00:17:44,167 --> 00:17:46,502
Go. Find yourself
a vending machine.

321
00:17:46,536 --> 00:17:49,237
Buy yourself a candy bar
and come back

322
00:17:49,272 --> 00:17:52,473
when you're ready to play nice.
Give me a dollar and I will.

323
00:17:57,345 --> 00:17:59,078
You're paying me back.

324
00:18:06,184 --> 00:18:07,651
Carry on.

325
00:18:07,685 --> 00:18:09,687
Oh, my lord.
That's terrible.

326
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:13,723
And you suspect foul play of some kind?
Uh, professor,
Dr. Seberg and her husband

327
00:18:13,758 --> 00:18:15,658
worked here at the institute
until '08,

328
00:18:15,692 --> 00:18:18,292
As did Florian Tripp
and Lilith Nash.

329
00:18:18,326 --> 00:18:22,263
Is that correct?
Yes. Brilliant research team.
We were very sorry to lose them.

330
00:18:22,298 --> 00:18:25,266
Money, you know? We tried
to hold them to their contract,

331
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,668
but Zitek threatened
a lawsuit,

332
00:18:27,702 --> 00:18:29,603
so they left
rather under a cloud.

333
00:18:29,637 --> 00:18:33,139
But Edmunds and Seberg
as a couple--did they get along?
Oh, I think so, despite all.

334
00:18:33,173 --> 00:18:35,474
Despite all what?

335
00:18:35,509 --> 00:18:38,443
Well, uh, I don't like to listen
to that sort of gossip,

336
00:18:38,478 --> 00:18:40,911
but, uh, one hears things.
Like?

337
00:18:40,946 --> 00:18:42,880
Edmunds was quite
the ladies' man.

338
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:46,715
He had affairs.
So I gather.
Quite the drama sometimes.

339
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:50,585
Drama of what type?
Fireworks, as it were,
you know.

340
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,654
But as I say,
I don't pay attention.

341
00:18:52,688 --> 00:18:54,889
Anybody you know who did--
pay attention?

342
00:18:54,923 --> 00:18:57,224
Ah, I believe
one of our grad students

343
00:18:57,259 --> 00:18:59,960
in the astrophysics department
was, uh, involved.

344
00:18:59,994 --> 00:19:02,462
Name?
Greta Skye.

345
00:19:07,868 --> 00:19:10,701
How long does this
decontamination take?

346
00:19:10,736 --> 00:19:11,969
Another hour.

347
00:19:12,003 --> 00:19:14,371
Hmm.

348
00:19:25,047 --> 00:19:27,048
Don't touch that, please.

349
00:19:28,684 --> 00:19:31,685
This is a murder investigation.
I can touch what I want.

350
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,554
You have a problem
with that?

351
00:19:33,588 --> 00:19:36,356
There's dangerous stuff
in here, that's all.

352
00:19:52,337 --> 00:19:54,804
I like what
they're doing these days.

353
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:56,906
They're making
regular candy bars,

354
00:19:56,941 --> 00:19:58,941
only with dark chocolate.

355
00:19:58,976 --> 00:20:00,476
You tried that?
No.

356
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,444
You--you want a bite?

357
00:20:02,478 --> 00:20:04,679
No, thank you.

358
00:20:04,714 --> 00:20:07,448
All right.

359
00:20:07,482 --> 00:20:09,950
Hmm. really good.

360
00:20:20,994 --> 00:20:23,195
Hi.

361
00:20:23,229 --> 00:20:26,197
Can you hear me?

362
00:20:26,231 --> 00:20:27,565
Isabel, right?

363
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:29,166
<i>Who are you?</i>

364
00:20:29,201 --> 00:20:30,601
My name's Patrick Jane.

365
00:20:30,635 --> 00:20:33,236
I'm here to find out
who killed your mother.

366
00:20:33,271 --> 00:20:36,372
<i>Good. Kill them, please.</i>

367
00:20:36,406 --> 00:20:38,340
Oh, I wish I was allowed
to do that.

368
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:43,211
You know, you should probably
step away from your computer.

369
00:20:43,245 --> 00:20:47,281
Do you have any friends nearby?
<i>I wanna be with my mother.</i>

370
00:20:47,315 --> 00:20:50,150
Yeah.

371
00:20:50,184 --> 00:20:52,385
I'm sorry for your loss.

372
00:20:54,488 --> 00:20:57,688
Do you have
a candy bar around at all?

373
00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:59,056
<i>What?</i>

374
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,024
Well, we were just talking
chocolate,

375
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:04,828
And it occurred to me that
chocolate would be good for you.

376
00:21:04,862 --> 00:21:08,931
All that emotion--
it wipes you out.

377
00:21:08,965 --> 00:21:10,966
And sugar's good
for energy.

378
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,002
<i>My mother is dead.</i>

379
00:21:14,036 --> 00:21:16,404
Chocolate and grief
is a good combination.

380
00:21:16,438 --> 00:21:20,341
You should try it.
It'll taste so much... Deeper,

381
00:21:20,376 --> 00:21:22,943
More intense.

382
00:21:22,978 --> 00:21:26,079
Everything will feel that way
for a while.

383
00:21:26,114 --> 00:21:27,747
You'll feel more alive.

384
00:21:27,782 --> 00:21:30,716
You should probably try
to hang on to that feeling

385
00:21:30,751 --> 00:21:33,619
as long as you can.
It's a gift.

386
00:21:33,653 --> 00:21:36,455
<i>I guess.</i>

387
00:21:36,489 --> 00:21:39,024
I want you to do something
for me now, Isabel.

388
00:21:39,058 --> 00:21:41,526
I want you to please
turn off your computer

389
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,228
and go and tell a friend
what's happened.

390
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:48,298
You do that now.

391
00:22:10,718 --> 00:22:12,351
Open sesame.

392
00:22:15,756 --> 00:22:18,691
Whoa!

393
00:22:22,028 --> 00:22:25,663
That wasn't meant to happen,
was it?

394
00:22:27,665 --> 00:22:28,999
Uh-oh.

395
00:22:29,033 --> 00:22:32,302
Do you have an advanced degree
in any of the physical sciences?

396
00:22:32,336 --> 00:22:33,269
Yes.

397
00:22:33,304 --> 00:22:36,038
Excuse me. Uh...
Sorry to interrupt.

398
00:22:36,072 --> 00:22:38,440
We need to expand
the pool of suspects.

399
00:22:38,474 --> 00:22:42,310
the tricky little high-tech
scanners let anyone in.

400
00:22:42,344 --> 00:22:43,811
That's nonsense.

401
00:22:43,845 --> 00:22:45,479
Try it.

402
00:22:52,653 --> 00:22:54,587
I'll be damned.

403
00:22:54,621 --> 00:22:57,056
See? Same with that door.
Anyone at this facility

404
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:59,525
could've gotten to those
little virus thingies--anyone.

405
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:02,460
Who's responsible
for the operation

406
00:23:02,494 --> 00:23:04,595
of the security scanners?
I have no idea

407
00:23:04,629 --> 00:23:07,197
How that could happen.
That's outrageous.
It's your job to oversee

408
00:23:07,231 --> 00:23:09,234
the security systems here,
isn't it?

409
00:23:09,268 --> 00:23:10,702
Not the technical aspects,
obviously.

410
00:23:10,736 --> 00:23:13,571
that's contracted out,
but I'll get right on 'em,

411
00:23:13,605 --> 00:23:17,107
Give 'em a piece of my mind,
believe you me.
You're showing us your palms.

412
00:23:17,141 --> 00:23:19,042
It's a supplicant gesture,

413
00:23:19,077 --> 00:23:20,543
Suggesting
a guilty conscience.

414
00:23:20,578 --> 00:23:22,345
That--that's not valid
or relevant.

415
00:23:22,379 --> 00:23:25,047
I'm--I'm simply stating
the facts. I have no idea

416
00:23:25,081 --> 00:23:27,015
Why the security system
doesn't work.

417
00:23:27,049 --> 00:23:29,650
The man's right.
You're not real convincing.

418
00:23:29,685 --> 00:23:32,553
I regret
that's your opinion,

419
00:23:32,587 --> 00:23:36,456
But I-I have no control over that.
Mr. Price, you're under arrest.

420
00:23:36,491 --> 00:23:38,224
For what?
Let's see.

421
00:23:38,259 --> 00:23:40,659
For one,
the murder of Alicia Seberg.

422
00:23:40,694 --> 00:23:42,928
That's absurd.

423
00:23:42,962 --> 00:23:44,897
And frankly, not your call.
Oh, is that right?

424
00:23:44,931 --> 00:23:47,232
Yeah, this homicide
investigation is ours.

425
00:23:47,266 --> 00:23:50,535
If we can't get along,
I'll call my friends at the FBI,

426
00:23:50,569 --> 00:23:52,370
get them to take over
from you.

427
00:23:52,404 --> 00:23:55,139
In fact, I <i>will</i> do that.
I'm sorry, little lady--

428
00:23:55,173 --> 00:23:57,040
Maybe you should step back--

429
00:23:57,074 --> 00:24:00,843
May-maybe I was right about
the supplicant palm gesture.

430
00:24:00,878 --> 00:24:02,278
Yep.

431
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:49,209
I... I wanna talk
to my lawyer.

432
00:24:49,243 --> 00:24:50,812
You have that right,
but if it doesn't--

433
00:24:50,841 --> 00:24:53,409
Have you ever sat in the back
of a military aircraft

434
00:24:53,444 --> 00:24:56,112
with a black hood over your head?
Uh... No.

435
00:24:56,146 --> 00:24:58,147
Well, then you got
a new experience comin',

436
00:24:58,182 --> 00:25:01,515
Because that is where this is
goin' unless you start talkin'

437
00:25:01,549 --> 00:25:03,750
Right about now!
Um... Look--

438
00:25:03,784 --> 00:25:05,018
Quiet.

439
00:25:06,765 --> 00:25:07,999
Please.

440
00:25:10,568 --> 00:25:12,869
The contractor screwed up.

441
00:25:12,904 --> 00:25:14,640
The software glitches
constantly,

442
00:25:14,674 --> 00:25:17,342
So... they're fixing it.

443
00:25:17,377 --> 00:25:20,611
Meanwhile, the system's down...
Temporarily.

444
00:25:20,646 --> 00:25:24,081
Nobody knew the system was down,
so in a way,

445
00:25:24,115 --> 00:25:27,119
it worked just as if
it was up and running...

446
00:25:27,153 --> 00:25:29,622
In a way.
How long was it down for?

447
00:25:29,656 --> 00:25:31,657
Two... Months.

448
00:25:31,691 --> 00:25:35,060
Two <i>months?</i> Anyone at all
could enter the lab--

449
00:25:35,094 --> 00:25:37,063
Terrorists, crazies,
thieves.

450
00:25:37,097 --> 00:25:39,632
Have you any idea
how much trouble you're in?

451
00:25:39,667 --> 00:25:41,801
Thieves?

452
00:25:41,836 --> 00:25:43,236
People wanna steal germs?

453
00:25:43,271 --> 00:25:48,175
Cryptohansa b strain is a--
is a must-have research tool.

454
00:25:48,209 --> 00:25:49,577
It's hard to make.

455
00:25:49,611 --> 00:25:52,981
It's worth $300,000 a gram
in the black market.

456
00:25:53,015 --> 00:25:55,851
Wow.
Isn't that right, Price?

457
00:25:55,885 --> 00:25:59,154
And you left the cupboard door
wide open.

458
00:25:59,189 --> 00:26:02,424
you are yea deep
in trouble, pal.

459
00:26:02,459 --> 00:26:05,625
You think about your situation
for a while.

460
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:09,330
Okay?
And we'll talk again.

461
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:26,513
You know he didn't
kill Alicia Seberg.

462
00:26:26,548 --> 00:26:27,517
You just like
scaring people, right?

463
00:26:27,527 --> 00:26:29,527
Hey,
if there was a murder here,

464
00:26:29,551 --> 00:26:30,719
I think
he's a very good suspect.

465
00:26:30,729 --> 00:26:33,429
Why? He has no interest
in her death.

466
00:26:33,454 --> 00:26:35,622
It could only lead to discovery
of the security breakdown.

467
00:26:35,632 --> 00:26:37,032
We'll see if he had
any other motives.

468
00:26:37,056 --> 00:26:39,789
The salient pot here is
that anyone could have gotten

469
00:26:39,824 --> 00:26:42,690
to those flasks,
not just Price.

470
00:26:42,724 --> 00:26:45,557
Kaseem could have, for instance,
or you could have.

471
00:26:45,591 --> 00:26:48,489
You were already here,
weren't you?

472
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:50,457
For an inventory check?

473
00:26:50,491 --> 00:26:53,257
What time did you get here,
exactly?

474
00:26:53,292 --> 00:26:55,222
The night before, right?
You remind me.

475
00:26:55,257 --> 00:26:57,687
I was goa call the fbi,
replace you people.

476
00:26:57,721 --> 00:27:00,021
And I was gonna tell <i>you</i>
that's not your call.

477
00:27:00,055 --> 00:27:02,390
We're here on
the direct say-so of the A.G.

478
00:27:02,424 --> 00:27:05,061
Call him. Tell him we're off
the case. See what he says.

479
00:27:05,571 --> 00:27:06,791
I might do that.

480
00:27:06,795 --> 00:27:09,430
We'll see how it goes,
shall we?

481
00:27:09,464 --> 00:27:12,298
It's time to open
the biohazard chamber.

482
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:16,168
Oh, that sounds fun,
opening the biohazard chamber.

483
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,804
Shouldn't we be
wearing masks or something?

484
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:24,608
No virus could possibly
survive the radiation bath.

485
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:29,111
The virus inside the flasks
are still alive, of course.

486
00:27:29,146 --> 00:27:31,113
But the flasks
are unbreakable.

487
00:27:31,147 --> 00:27:33,248
There's no danger.

488
00:27:41,922 --> 00:27:43,923
Five flasks intact.

489
00:27:47,526 --> 00:27:50,628
Let's get these babies back
in deep freeze.

490
00:27:58,701 --> 00:28:00,102
Okay. We're copacetic.

491
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:03,338
let's send
Alicia Seberg on her way.

492
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:10,679
Doctor, this is
a crime scene now. You can't--

493
00:28:10,714 --> 00:28:12,814
let him stay.

494
00:28:34,262 --> 00:28:38,565
oh, my God.

495
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:40,000
Oh, my God.

496
00:28:40,034 --> 00:28:41,968
And, Greta, you had
a sexual relationship

497
00:28:42,003 --> 00:28:44,037
With Cliff Edmunds,
the victim's husband,

498
00:28:44,071 --> 00:28:45,471
Is that right?

499
00:28:45,505 --> 00:28:49,641
No. I mean, yes.
It wasn't--well, yes, I did.

500
00:28:49,676 --> 00:28:51,543
But I didn't.

501
00:28:51,577 --> 00:28:54,512
You don't think I had something
to do with killing her?

502
00:28:54,546 --> 00:28:56,513
No, ma'am, we're just looking

503
00:28:56,548 --> 00:29:00,717
For insight into their relationship.
You think Cliff killed her.

504
00:29:00,751 --> 00:29:02,885
Is he the jealous type?
Not at all.

505
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,954
Did he ever show violence
to you?

506
00:29:04,988 --> 00:29:07,823
No, no. Cliff is
a very gentle soul, really.

507
00:29:07,857 --> 00:29:10,024
And Alicia's such
a cool person.

508
00:29:10,059 --> 00:29:12,793
We heard
there was trouble.

509
00:29:12,827 --> 00:29:14,261
No.

510
00:29:14,295 --> 00:29:16,062
Well...

511
00:29:16,096 --> 00:29:17,496
There was one incident,

512
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:21,132
But it had nothing to do
with Cliff or Alicia, really

513
00:29:21,167 --> 00:29:22,100
Please continue.

514
00:29:22,134 --> 00:29:24,635
We'd been seeing each other
for a while.

515
00:29:24,669 --> 00:29:26,636
Somebody left a note
for me,

516
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:29,604
Pushed under by door
in the middle of the night.

517
00:29:29,639 --> 00:29:31,606
Basically,
it said I was a whore

518
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,540
And I should stay away
from Cliff.

519
00:29:33,575 --> 00:29:36,576
It was very ugly.
It was anonymous, of course.

520
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:40,946
Who do you think
sent the note?
I thought at first it was
Alicia Seberg, naturally.

521
00:29:40,981 --> 00:29:43,849
But it turns out she wasn't
even in thcountry

522
00:29:43,883 --> 00:29:47,152
On the night in question.
Who's your next best guess

523
00:29:47,186 --> 00:29:49,720
Um, the one time I went
to see Cliff at work,

524
00:29:49,755 --> 00:29:51,722
There was a lab assistant.

525
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:55,992
E gave me this glare
like a death ray,

526
00:29:56,026 --> 00:29:59,361
And I thought maybe it was her.
What's her name?

527
00:29:59,396 --> 00:30:00,896
Lilith Nash.

528
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:02,865
The question is why now?

529
00:30:02,899 --> 00:30:05,768
What was it that triggered
the killing? What changed?

530
00:30:05,803 --> 00:30:07,870
What's the answer?

531
00:30:07,904 --> 00:30:11,539
Well, for
one thing, Harken showed up.
You think Harken did this?

532
00:30:11,574 --> 00:30:14,142
Ooh, I'd like that.
But what's his motive?

533
00:30:16,278 --> 00:30:17,311
Van Pelt.

534
00:30:17,345 --> 00:30:19,846
Boss, Cho and Rigsby found
an ex-lover

535
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,414
of the vic's husband.

536
00:30:21,448 --> 00:30:24,183
She thinks Lilith Nash sent her
a menacing note.

537
00:30:24,217 --> 00:30:27,219
Interesting.
So I dug deeper.

538
00:30:27,253 --> 00:30:29,454
Nash is clean
under her current name

539
00:30:29,488 --> 00:30:32,755
But had a brief marriage
in Canada in '96, '97.

540
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:35,892
under that name, Lilith Blaum,
in '99, still in Canada,

541
00:30:35,926 --> 00:30:38,127
She had a restraining order
taken out against her

542
00:30:38,162 --> 00:30:40,030
by her ex-husband
and subsequently

543
00:30:40,065 --> 00:30:41,935
spent four months in a
secure Mental Institute.

544
00:30:42,036 --> 00:30:43,536
Well, that could happen
to anyone.

545
00:30:43,569 --> 00:30:45,371
Uh, Van Pelt,
could you do me a favor?

546
00:30:45,405 --> 00:30:47,710
Could you call Cho and Rigsby
and have them get out here

547
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:49,112
as quick as possible?
Why?

548
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:51,481
I got a hunch
we're gonna need'em.
Okay.

549
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:53,655
Thank you.
Will do.

550
00:30:53,689 --> 00:30:55,593
Let's go talk to Nash.
Meh.

551
00:30:55,627 --> 00:30:58,264
What?
I think she's good for it.
Ah, she's nuts.

552
00:30:58,299 --> 00:31:00,801
She's got a nutty little
secret crush on the boss,

553
00:31:00,835 --> 00:31:02,769
Kills e wife.
Something like that.

554
00:31:02,804 --> 00:31:05,071
She did seem nervous,
but why kill now?

555
00:31:05,106 --> 00:31:08,507
And why would she use the virus?
I don't know.
Let's go and ask her.

556
00:31:08,542 --> 00:31:10,176
Ugh, if you want to.

557
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:12,211
You know,
you're just resisting Nash

558
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,713
because you didn't peg her
right away as the one.

559
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:17,549
No, I'm resisting Nash because,
uh, she isn't the one.

560
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:20,084
But if you wanna go talk to her,
let's go talk to her.

561
00:31:20,118 --> 00:31:23,320
But whatever you do,
do not tell Harken.

562
00:31:23,354 --> 00:31:24,988
Why not? It's procedure.

563
00:31:25,022 --> 00:31:27,390
Fig for procedure.
He'll stomp all over her.

564
00:31:27,424 --> 00:31:31,394
She'll clam up. You'll get
nothing but a waste of time.
I'm telling Harken.

565
00:31:34,899 --> 00:31:36,533
Okay.

566
00:31:51,613 --> 00:31:53,780
Nash, come with me.

567
00:31:55,183 --> 00:31:56,583
Now.

568
00:32:03,857 --> 00:32:06,525
Thank you.

569
00:32:09,495 --> 00:32:10,896
Stand there.

570
00:32:16,138 --> 00:32:19,573
Listen closely
and please tell the truth.

571
00:32:19,608 --> 00:32:22,910
Is there a way out of here
that avoids the main gates?

572
00:32:22,944 --> 00:32:25,212
A back way out?
Yes.

573
00:32:25,246 --> 00:32:26,346
Where?

574
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,380
Walk a mile north.

575
00:32:27,415 --> 00:32:29,882
There's a culvert
that goes under the fence

576
00:32:29,917 --> 00:32:32,251
Halfway along
the northeast property line.

577
00:32:32,285 --> 00:32:35,454
Excellent.
Now... Tell the truth.

578
00:32:35,488 --> 00:32:38,856
Did you ever go
by the name Lilith Blaum?

579
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:39,990
Yes.

580
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:42,325
Did you spend time
in a mental asylum?

581
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,060
Yes.

582
00:32:44,094 --> 00:32:47,529
Do you have a secret crush
on Cliff Edmunds?

583
00:32:47,564 --> 00:32:48,997
Yes.

584
00:32:49,032 --> 00:32:51,433
Did you kill Alicia Seberg?

585
00:32:51,467 --> 00:32:53,568
No.

586
00:32:53,602 --> 00:32:55,069
I believe you,

587
00:32:55,104 --> 00:32:57,138
But I know how
Harken's thoughts run.

588
00:32:57,172 --> 00:33:00,074
A way to blame you
will be found.

589
00:33:00,108 --> 00:33:02,576
I repeat. I know how
Harken's thoughts run.

590
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:06,380
A way to blame you
will be found. Do you hear me?
Yes.

591
00:33:06,414 --> 00:33:08,215
Excellent.

592
00:33:13,021 --> 00:33:15,623
Go.

593
00:33:18,594 --> 00:33:20,595
Did Lilith Nash
come back in here?

594
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:22,230
No.

595
00:33:22,264 --> 00:33:23,695
Uh, that's odd.

596
00:33:23,729 --> 00:33:25,728
Where's Lilith Nash?

597
00:33:25,763 --> 00:33:27,163
Uh, she left with--

598
00:33:27,197 --> 00:33:29,231
You don't need to worry
about her.

599
00:33:29,266 --> 00:33:30,666
She's not guilty.

600
00:33:30,701 --> 00:33:33,769
And how do you know that?
Because I asked her.
She told me.

601
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:37,404
Uh-huh. And where is she now?
Um... I don't know.

602
00:33:37,439 --> 00:33:38,705
Security.

603
00:33:49,915 --> 00:33:52,816
She's not in her room.
She's nowhere to be found.

604
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:55,818
Oh, you people are overreacting.
I'm sure she's no danger.

605
00:33:55,852 --> 00:33:58,086
She's mentally unstable
and probably a killer,

606
00:33:58,121 --> 00:34:01,656
But you're sure she's no danger.
Well, that's reassuring.
Well, even if she is
those things,

607
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:03,491
And I don't say that she is,

608
00:34:03,525 --> 00:34:06,593
Then she's done her worst
already.
Mr. Harken!
We have a code red.

609
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:09,796
What's a code red?
What? No.

610
00:34:16,904 --> 00:34:18,504
Oh, no.

611
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:22,074
Oh.

612
00:34:27,425 --> 00:34:29,826
Anyone within a quarter-mile
radius of this flask

613
00:34:29,861 --> 00:34:32,296
Is gonna be dead within
the next four to six hours.

614
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:34,632
But I put the flasks
in the safe.

615
00:34:34,666 --> 00:34:38,703
She must have gotten
into the safe somehow.
W-- h-how is that possible?

616
00:35:00,863 --> 00:35:02,696
What was that?

617
00:35:02,731 --> 00:35:04,564
A beaker fell.
What?

618
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:08,234
There's only one missing.

619
00:35:08,268 --> 00:35:11,470
That's a relief, anyhow.
But how did she do it?

620
00:35:11,505 --> 00:35:14,439
Never mind how. She's done it.
What do we do now?

621
00:35:14,474 --> 00:35:16,441
Well, there's nothing
we <i>can</i> do.

622
00:35:16,475 --> 00:35:19,210
In the next four hours,
we'll all be dead.

623
00:35:19,244 --> 00:35:21,245
tell me the truth.

624
00:35:21,279 --> 00:35:22,746
This is a trick right?

625
00:35:22,781 --> 00:35:25,282
No. Why would I do
something like that?

626
00:35:25,316 --> 00:35:28,651
What would be the point?
Swear on your child's grave.

627
00:35:28,685 --> 00:35:31,854
You know I don't do that,
not for anything.

628
00:35:35,692 --> 00:35:38,426
Oh, my God.

629
00:35:38,461 --> 00:35:40,762
This is a drill, right?
Uh, this is not a drill.

630
00:35:40,796 --> 00:35:43,365
This is--this is the real thing.
I'm sorry.

631
00:35:46,068 --> 00:35:49,037
Listen up.

632
00:35:49,071 --> 00:35:51,606
We have a few hours left.

633
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,475
But we'll keep
this virus contained here.

634
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:57,277
Nobody leaves this facility.

635
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:01,281
And then what?
We get buried in the desert?

636
00:36:01,315 --> 00:36:03,683
The air force will drop
incendiary bombs

637
00:36:03,717 --> 00:36:06,285
On the facility,
burn the virus out.

638
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,654
Your next of kin
will be informed.

639
00:36:08,689 --> 00:36:12,258
Like I say,
we have a few hours left,

640
00:36:12,292 --> 00:36:14,928
So we all should make
our arrangements

641
00:36:14,962 --> 00:36:17,731
And say our prayers
as best we can.

642
00:36:17,765 --> 00:36:20,100
Make your phone calls.

643
00:36:21,168 --> 00:36:23,703
May God have mercy
on our souls.

644
00:36:37,853 --> 00:36:40,889
Hey, boss. We're about
five minutes from your location.

645
00:36:40,923 --> 00:36:42,256
Cho, listen.

646
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:45,122
Jane and I have been exposed
to the virus,

647
00:36:45,157 --> 00:36:48,355
And it looks like
we might die soon.

648
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:51,025
Okay.

649
00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:55,391
So I wanna thank you and Rigsby
and Van Pelt.

650
00:36:55,425 --> 00:36:59,360
It's been an honor
working with you.

651
00:36:59,394 --> 00:37:01,862
I need you to call
my brother Tommy.

652
00:37:01,896 --> 00:37:03,864
His number is
in my desk diary.

653
00:37:03,899 --> 00:37:08,202
It's under
Town and Country Electrical.

654
00:37:08,237 --> 00:37:10,104
Tell him that I love him

655
00:37:10,138 --> 00:37:13,039
And that I forgive him
for whatever

656
00:37:13,074 --> 00:37:18,344
And that, um, he needs to make
peace with his brothers.

657
00:37:18,378 --> 00:37:20,946
It's my last dying wish.
You tell him that.

658
00:37:20,981 --> 00:37:22,614
Will do.

659
00:37:22,649 --> 00:37:26,384
Okay. Good-bye.

660
00:37:26,418 --> 00:37:30,723
Uh, wait. I-I wanted
to talk to them also.

661
00:37:30,757 --> 00:37:31,960
Sorry.

662
00:37:31,992 --> 00:37:33,626
It's all right.

663
00:37:38,398 --> 00:37:40,399
That's a fine farewell.

664
00:37:43,737 --> 00:37:47,640
I feared that you'd become
tearful and incoherent, but no.

665
00:37:47,674 --> 00:37:50,075
Succinct.

666
00:37:50,109 --> 00:37:52,343
Noble. Bravo.

667
00:37:52,378 --> 00:37:54,713
Uh-huh.

668
00:37:56,749 --> 00:37:59,151
Don't you have anybody
you wanna call

669
00:37:59,185 --> 00:38:01,185
Besides Cho and Rigsby?

670
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,887
No.

671
00:38:04,823 --> 00:38:06,990
And if <i>were</i> dying,
I'd wanna call you,

672
00:38:07,025 --> 00:38:09,926
But... You're already here.
So there's no need.

673
00:38:09,961 --> 00:38:10,961
Me?

674
00:38:10,995 --> 00:38:12,295
Hmm?

675
00:38:13,898 --> 00:38:16,967
Oh...        What would you say?

676
00:38:17,001 --> 00:38:22,172
Uh... Wait--
wait a minute. <i>If?</i>

677
00:38:24,041 --> 00:38:27,111
<i>If</i> I was dying?
Yeah, you're not really dying.

678
00:38:27,145 --> 00:38:30,515
I wrote a label
and put it on an empty flask,

679
00:38:30,548 --> 00:38:32,583
And then I convinced
poor Lilith Nash to run away.

680
00:38:32,617 --> 00:38:35,652
I feel kind of bad about it--
you son of a bitch.

681
00:38:35,687 --> 00:38:38,222
But just--just wait.
Just please. Be still. Cho?

682
00:38:38,256 --> 00:38:40,691
This is Jane. Please disregard
Lisbon's last message.

683
00:38:40,725 --> 00:38:43,193
I tricked her. My bad.
I'm so sorry.

684
00:38:43,261 --> 00:38:46,264
are you at
the culvert? Okay, good. Wait.

685
00:38:46,298 --> 00:38:49,167
There'll be some people
coming your way soon. Bye.

686
00:38:49,202 --> 00:38:50,802
You're sick.

687
00:38:50,837 --> 00:38:53,336
Why would you do this
to me?

688
00:38:53,371 --> 00:38:56,338
Two reasons--firstly, to catch
the killer of Alicia Seberg,

689
00:38:56,373 --> 00:38:58,807
The killer who is not
poor Lilith Nash.

690
00:38:58,842 --> 00:39:00,976
The killer who,
you may recall,

691
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:03,779
Took a dose of the antidote
in order to survive

692
00:39:03,813 --> 00:39:05,814
Exposure to the virus. Yes?
Yes...

693
00:39:05,848 --> 00:39:07,549
The killer who believes
that he or she

694
00:39:07,583 --> 00:39:10,618
Is the only one
that isn't going to die. Yes?
Yes.

695
00:39:10,653 --> 00:39:13,454
So they have to get out of here
before <i>we</i> die,

696
00:39:13,488 --> 00:39:16,489
Or else they'll be burnt
to a crisp by the Air Force.

697
00:39:16,524 --> 00:39:19,493
Their hands are tied.
They have to try to escape,

698
00:39:19,527 --> 00:39:21,995
Thus revealing themselves to us
with precision and clarity

699
00:39:22,029 --> 00:39:25,698
Of a mathematical equation.
And reason number two?

700
00:39:25,732 --> 00:39:27,667
The second
and most important reason

701
00:39:27,701 --> 00:39:31,871
is doesn't it feel great
to get your life back?

702
00:39:31,906 --> 00:39:33,873
Don't you feel good
right now?

703
00:39:33,907 --> 00:39:36,075
Don't you feel happy
to be alive?

704
00:39:36,109 --> 00:39:37,209
No!

705
00:39:37,244 --> 00:39:39,478
Oh, I know you do.
You know you do.

706
00:39:39,513 --> 00:39:42,581
If reason number one does not
pan out very, very soon,

707
00:39:42,616 --> 00:39:46,118
I think I'm gonna punch you
in the nose.

708
00:39:46,152 --> 00:39:47,553
Forbearance, Lisbon.

709
00:39:47,587 --> 00:39:50,054
Any moment now, Harken is
gonna come around that corner

710
00:39:50,088 --> 00:39:52,755
With an anxious expression
on his face

711
00:39:52,789 --> 00:39:54,754
Because someone has run off.

712
00:39:54,788 --> 00:39:56,521
Any moment now.

713
00:39:56,556 --> 00:39:59,056
Wait.

714
00:39:59,091 --> 00:40:02,391
Any moment.

715
00:40:05,425 --> 00:40:06,925
Nothing.

716
00:40:09,829 --> 00:40:11,195
If you just get--

717
00:40:11,229 --> 00:40:13,630
ow!

718
00:40:13,664 --> 00:40:16,632
Ow!

719
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:20,268
ow. Whoo!

720
00:40:20,302 --> 00:40:22,969
that's what
I'm talking 'bout.

721
00:40:43,856 --> 00:40:45,661
Hi.

722
00:40:51,533 --> 00:40:54,002
Well, this was all a hoax?

723
00:40:54,036 --> 00:40:57,738
Well, "hoax" is a little strong.
Uh, more of a ruse, a gambit.

724
00:40:57,773 --> 00:41:00,107
The important thing is
we caught the killer.

725
00:41:00,141 --> 00:41:03,610
Right? That's what's important.
That's what's important.
Griffin Welks, huh?

726
00:41:03,644 --> 00:41:06,179
Never would have caught him
your way, and my way--

727
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:08,448
Cathartic
<i>and</i> life-affirming.

728
00:41:08,482 --> 00:41:12,551
You know what?
You're on your own.

729
00:41:12,586 --> 00:41:15,054
Okay, the important thing now
is to be careful

730
00:41:15,088 --> 00:41:17,990
'cause this is
the real thing. Okay?

731
00:41:18,025 --> 00:41:20,660
All right, let's get that back
in the deep freeze.

732
00:41:20,694 --> 00:41:22,928
See you around, big dog.

733
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:33,405
I was siphoning off small
amounts of the virus matrix

734
00:41:33,439 --> 00:41:35,474
and selling it
on the black market.

735
00:41:35,508 --> 00:41:36,975
$300,000 a gram.

736
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:39,945
Yeah.

737
00:41:39,979 --> 00:41:41,213
Yeah, exactly.

738
00:41:41,247 --> 00:41:44,383
I'm in charge of keeping
inventory, so it was easy,

739
00:41:44,417 --> 00:41:46,785
until Harken arrived
to do a spot check,

740
00:41:46,819 --> 00:41:49,855
And I had to do something fast,
so I spilled a flask

741
00:41:49,889 --> 00:41:51,824
to cover up
the missing quantity.

742
00:41:51,858 --> 00:41:54,794
Knowing full well
Alicia Seberg would be exposed.

743
00:41:56,263 --> 00:42:00,434
Someone had to be responsible.

744
00:42:00,468 --> 00:42:02,836
I figured
everyone would think

745
00:42:02,871 --> 00:42:04,906
that she'd opened the flask
by accident

746
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,975
and couldn't admit to it,

747
00:42:07,009 --> 00:42:10,045
'cause she was like that--
couldn't be wrong.

748
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:14,283
I'm curious. The money
you made from your theft--

749
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:15,751
How'd you spend it?

750
00:42:15,786 --> 00:42:17,319
I didn't.

751
00:42:17,354 --> 00:42:19,956
I have it in treasury bonds
mostly, some real estate.

752
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:21,891
Mm-hmm,
that's smart investing.

753
00:42:21,925 --> 00:42:24,127
You'll be the richest man
in Folsom.

754
00:42:34,438 --> 00:42:36,473
Whew. Long day.

755
00:42:38,075 --> 00:42:39,376
Ooh.

756
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:42,179
It's chilly around here.
You still angry with me?

757
00:42:42,213 --> 00:42:44,047
Duh.

758
00:42:44,082 --> 00:42:46,183
Oh, confess.
You do feel better.

759
00:42:46,217 --> 00:42:48,852
You feel much more alive.
I know you do.

760
00:42:48,887 --> 00:42:51,990
You know what
made me feel better?

761
00:42:52,025 --> 00:42:54,760
Punching you in the nose.

762
00:42:54,794 --> 00:42:58,863
Ah. Glad to be of service.
