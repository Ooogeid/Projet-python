1
00:00:22,266 --> 00:00:24,426
He's from the A.G.'s office.
We're catching a hot one.

2
00:00:24,426 --> 00:00:27,566
Hooray! I was about
to go mad with boredom.

3
00:00:27,566 --> 00:00:29,596
Don't say "hooray". Someone's died.

4
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:31,866
Well, if they have,
my happiness makes

5
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:35,266
- no difference to them. 
- Nor does catching the killer, for that matter.

6
00:00:35,266 --> 00:00:38,066
True, but it makes a
difference to the klier.

7
00:00:38,066 --> 00:00:40,896
This e-mail just came to
the Attorney General's office

8
00:00:40,896 --> 00:00:43,096
and the Governor's
office 20 minutes ago.

9
00:00:43,096 --> 00:00:45,696
"Pay attention. At
exactly 11:05 a.m. today,

10
00:00:45,696 --> 00:00:51,926
"at 35.04 north and 116.49 west,

11
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:54,526
"you'll see an arrogant
and greedy person

12
00:00:54,526 --> 00:00:57,696
"punished with death, and
you will know I'm serious.

13
00:00:57,696 --> 00:00:59,526
Signed, Joe Q. Public."

14
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:01,096
- Interesting. 
- It's probably nothing.

15
00:01:01,096 --> 00:01:03,326
So why can't the local
police handle it then?

16
00:01:03,326 --> 00:01:05,896
Some fool let the Governor
read the damn thing.

17
00:01:05,896 --> 00:01:08,026
So he talks to the A.G.,
the A.G. talks to Minelli,

18
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:11,126
and Minelli tells me we
have to handle it personally.

19
00:01:11,126 --> 00:01:13,466
Rigsby, you're the fastest
driver. If we leave now

20
00:01:13,466 --> 00:01:15,896
- and push it, we can get there by 11:05. 
- Where is it?

21
00:01:15,896 --> 00:01:18,226
Mojave desert, middle of nowhere,

22
00:01:18,226 --> 00:01:20,426
- quarter of a mile off the highway. 
- Interesting.

23
00:01:20,426 --> 00:01:25,766
- Boring. Three hours away. 
- Desert's beautiful this time of year.

24
00:01:25,766 --> 00:01:28,596
Let's all go.

25
00:01:28,596 --> 00:01:32,826
We can bring a picnic lunch.

26
00:01:35,566 --> 00:01:39,926
Someone has to stay
and answer the phones.

27
00:01:55,196 --> 00:01:58,566
How much further?

28
00:01:58,566 --> 00:02:00,926
About 50 feet.

29
00:02:00,926 --> 00:02:04,126
Look at that. Look what I found.

30
00:02:04,126 --> 00:02:05,896
What is it?

31
00:02:05,896 --> 00:02:09,466
It's a worm. It's
a fossilized worm.

32
00:02:09,466 --> 00:02:10,896
I'm happy for you.

33
00:02:10,896 --> 00:02:14,126
Yeah, this is it. This is the spot.

34
00:02:14,126 --> 00:02:17,726
11:04 and change...

35
00:02:17,726 --> 00:02:19,266
right on time.

36
00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:22,066
- For what? 
- There's still 15 seconds to go.

37
00:02:22,066 --> 00:02:24,066
You know, when this worm was alive,

38
00:02:24,066 --> 00:02:26,766
this whole desert was
the floor of a great sea.

39
00:02:26,766 --> 00:02:28,966
There were dinosaurs
swimming above us.

40
00:02:28,966 --> 00:02:31,796
- That is kinda awesome. 
- Yeah.

41
00:02:31,796 --> 00:02:33,826
Sharks the size of buses.

42
00:02:33,826 --> 00:02:35,826
brilliantly colored sea monsters.

43
00:02:35,826 --> 00:02:37,326
Those mountains...

44
00:02:37,326 --> 00:02:39,326
they would've been volcanoes.

45
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:43,126
This is a goat turd
about six months old.

46
00:02:43,126 --> 00:02:44,826
Still...

47
00:02:44,826 --> 00:02:48,126
giant sharks, here.

48
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,626
Okay, we've done our job.

49
00:02:50,626 --> 00:02:52,966
Somebody yanked our chain
pretty good. Let's go.

50
00:02:52,966 --> 00:02:55,266
Wait. I think we should wait.

51
00:02:55,266 --> 00:02:57,796
What for? What could
possibly happen?

52
00:02:57,796 --> 00:03:00,466
I have no idea, but
it's a pleasant spot,

53
00:03:00,466 --> 00:03:02,166
and I have sandwiches.

54
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,866
We'll eat 'em in the car.
We've wasted enough time.

55
00:03:04,866 --> 00:03:07,326
Hey, did you hear that?

56
00:03:07,326 --> 00:03:10,566
Yeah. What is that?

57
00:03:25,526 --> 00:03:28,026
Yeah, our victim's name
is David Whittaker...

58
00:03:28,026 --> 00:03:30,026
one of a party of
six casual skydivers

59
00:03:30,026 --> 00:03:32,366
that went up with an
instructor this morning.

60
00:03:32,366 --> 00:03:34,666
All executives of a company
called Carnelian Prime Trust

61
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,666
out here on an outdoor
adventure retreat.

62
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:39,666
Yeah, our victim was, uh,
V.P. of human resources.

63
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:42,526
David Whittaker,
Carnelian Prime Trust.

64
00:03:42,526 --> 00:03:45,726
Got it. I'll start digging.

65
00:03:46,196 --> 00:03:49,196
You see that right there?
That's the master strap, okay?

66
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:51,726
And it was cut
nearly clean through.

67
00:03:51,726 --> 00:03:54,166
Now that has to be
deliberate, and that is evil.

68
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,096
'Cause the minute
this thing deployed,

69
00:03:56,096 --> 00:03:58,196
the chute would've come clean off.

70
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:01,226
- Who rigged the chute? 
- Me. I did. Last night,

71
00:04:01,226 --> 00:04:03,466
and I double-checked
every one of 'em.

72
00:04:03,466 --> 00:04:05,596
They were a-ok. I guarantee it.

73
00:04:05,596 --> 00:04:09,126
- This was done after. 
- By someone that knows parachutes.

74
00:04:09,126 --> 00:04:11,696
Yes. I've been rigging
chutes for 15 years,

75
00:04:11,696 --> 00:04:14,526
and I've never had one
accident, not one. Never.

76
00:04:14,526 --> 00:04:17,366
There's a number on
there. Is there any way

77
00:04:17,366 --> 00:04:19,726
to identify which chute
is for which jumper?

78
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:21,896
Are they assigned to individuals?

79
00:04:21,896 --> 00:04:24,766
I just tell the jumpers to grab
the first chute they come to.

80
00:04:24,766 --> 00:04:29,726
- Those numbers are strictly for the maintenance logs. 
- Well, who had access to the chutes

81
00:04:29,726 --> 00:04:33,066
- after you rigged them? 
- They're just... they're in the hangar overnight,

82
00:04:33,066 --> 00:04:36,626
- not locked or anything. 
- So anyone who had access to the airport, basically.

83
00:04:36,626 --> 00:04:38,866
Agent Lisbon, is it? We're leaving.

84
00:04:38,866 --> 00:04:41,696
Keep my office informed.
And you... you'll be hearing

85
00:04:41,696 --> 00:04:43,596
from our lawyers. Yeah, do it now.

86
00:04:43,596 --> 00:04:49,026
- Are you gonna let him get away with that? 
- Shh. Mr. Faulk?

87
00:04:49,426 --> 00:04:51,426
This is a murder investigation.

88
00:04:51,426 --> 00:04:54,496
You can't leave until
we say you can leave.

89
00:04:54,496 --> 00:04:56,396
I apologize.

90
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:59,926
I thought we had answered
all your questions.

91
00:05:00,996 --> 00:05:04,666
- Do we have your permission to leave, Agent Lisbon? 
- Yes, you do,

92
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:07,296
But we're gonna have a
lot of follow-up questions.

93
00:05:07,296 --> 00:05:09,866
You know our location.

94
00:05:09,866 --> 00:05:13,726
Yes, we do. We'll be
in touch, Mr. Faulk.

95
00:05:21,326 --> 00:05:24,166
Why isn't the body on the move yet?

96
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:27,666
- Well, forensics is still working the scene. 
- He fell from the sky.

97
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:31,196
- What could they work on for an hour? 
- Nerds. They won't be hurried.

98
00:05:31,196 --> 00:05:33,396
So who is this Randall Faulk guy,

99
00:05:33,396 --> 00:05:35,396
And what does he do?

100
00:05:35,396 --> 00:05:38,226
President and C.E.O. of
Carnelian prime trust.

101
00:05:38,226 --> 00:05:41,866
They're one of the top
ten private equity firms

102
00:05:41,866 --> 00:05:44,866
in the world. They buy
and sell big companies...

103
00:05:44,866 --> 00:05:47,066
Oil, steel, auto
plants, hotel chains.

104
00:05:47,066 --> 00:05:49,766
- You name it, they own it.
 - Uh-huh. Rich bastards.

105
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,196
As soon as the scene's clear,
you two go to the airport.

106
00:05:52,196 --> 00:05:54,996
Find out who had access to
the parachutes last night.

107
00:05:54,996 --> 00:05:58,326
And find out about Spruell's
history. See if anything bumps.

108
00:05:58,326 --> 00:06:01,366
Yeah, you got it.

109
00:06:02,296 --> 00:06:03,926
Van Pelt, what's up?

110
00:06:03,926 --> 00:06:07,666
- Are you close to a TV? 
- No, why?

111
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:10,496
Oh, hell.

112
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:13,666
You want your sandwich?

113
00:06:22,496 --> 00:06:24,166
Help you?

114
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,166
We're looking for Mr. Faulk.

115
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:27,866
Right up in the house.

116
00:06:27,866 --> 00:06:30,396
- Thank you. 
- Thanks.

117
00:06:30,396 --> 00:06:33,366
Following Mr.Whittaker's
horrific death,

118
00:06:33,366 --> 00:06:36,626
a message was sent within
the past hour to the police

119
00:06:36,626 --> 00:06:39,766
and several media outlets,
including channel 4 news.

120
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:41,896
It reads, "I have
proved my strength."

121
00:06:41,896 --> 00:06:44,166
"I have scored one
for the little guy,"

122
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,266
"and I would do it again,"

123
00:06:46,266 --> 00:06:49,266
"unless Carnelian Prime
Trust makes a public apology"

124
00:06:49,266 --> 00:06:51,626
"for its greed and arrogance"

125
00:06:51,626 --> 00:06:54,196
"and promises to change its ways."

126
00:06:54,196 --> 00:06:56,326
"Yours truly, Joe Q. Public."

127
00:06:56,326 --> 00:06:58,666
Illiterate nonsense.

128
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:01,666
Perhaps. But the threat
to your lives is explicit.

129
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:04,596
We need to set up a security plan

130
00:07:04,596 --> 00:07:06,666
with the marshal's services.

131
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:09,466
What time are you planning
on going back to the city?

132
00:07:09,466 --> 00:07:12,266
We're not. We're staying here.
We're continuing the retreat.

133
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:16,526
Oh, for god sake, Rand. Perhaps
there are other considerations here?

134
00:07:16,526 --> 00:07:18,166
I'm not sure staying here

135
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,396
is the most advisable
safety posture.

136
00:07:20,396 --> 00:07:23,126
We stay. I'm not letting
some random lunatic

137
00:07:23,126 --> 00:07:26,366
disturb Carnelian. This
is a test of our strength.

138
00:07:26,366 --> 00:07:28,096
David would want us to continue.

139
00:07:28,096 --> 00:07:31,766
Yes, he would. Yes, he would.
David would never back down.

140
00:07:31,766 --> 00:07:33,966
David wouldn't want you
to respectfully acknowledge

141
00:07:33,966 --> 00:07:36,226
his tragic and untimely death?

142
00:07:36,226 --> 00:07:39,996
Oh, he... he wouldn't
want it to interfere

143
00:07:39,996 --> 00:07:43,066
with your kayaking schedule.

144
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:48,326
- Joan, is it? 
- Jane, like the girl.

145
00:07:48,326 --> 00:07:51,166
Jane. Mr.Jane.

146
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:54,396
- Mr.Jane. 
- Thank you.

147
00:07:54,396 --> 00:07:57,196
This week that we spent
here is not a vacation.

148
00:07:57,196 --> 00:07:59,896
This is a test. What we
learn here about ourselves

149
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:03,026
and about each other is at
the core of the philosophy

150
00:08:03,026 --> 00:08:05,026
of Carnelian's success.

151
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,466
Now there will come
an appropriate moment

152
00:08:07,466 --> 00:08:09,496
to mourn our dear friend.

153
00:08:09,496 --> 00:08:12,596
This is the moment to show resolve

154
00:08:12,596 --> 00:08:15,566
and courage.

155
00:08:15,566 --> 00:08:17,066
And now perhaps

156
00:08:17,066 --> 00:08:19,926
you can give us a briefing
on the case so far.

157
00:08:19,926 --> 00:08:22,826
We investigate murders.
We don't give briefings.

158
00:08:22,826 --> 00:08:25,426
Why on earth not? We
have the right to know.

159
00:08:25,426 --> 00:08:28,426
- We're the victims here. 
- David Whittaker is the victim here.

160
00:08:28,426 --> 00:08:30,526
Any one of us could've
picked that bad chute.

161
00:08:30,526 --> 00:08:32,626
Any one of us could
be dead right now.

162
00:08:32,626 --> 00:08:35,296
Yes, but the saboteur didn't
know which one of you would die.

163
00:08:35,296 --> 00:08:38,496
He felt that any one of
you would fit the bill.

164
00:08:38,496 --> 00:08:42,726
"Greedy and arrogant." How
does that make you feel?

165
00:08:42,726 --> 00:08:46,266
- What, is this group therapy? 
- Do you want group therapy?

166
00:08:46,266 --> 00:08:48,866
No, we want a professional
police detective.

167
00:08:48,866 --> 00:08:51,496
I will be speaking
with your superiors

168
00:08:51,496 --> 00:08:53,596
just to assure myself
that your people

169
00:08:53,596 --> 00:08:56,496
- are the best option going forward. 
- That's a good assurance to get.

170
00:08:56,496 --> 00:08:58,126
Quick question...

171
00:08:58,126 --> 00:09:01,396
What is the worst thing
you people have done lately?

172
00:09:01,396 --> 00:09:04,366
We control assets
of over $50 billion.

173
00:09:04,366 --> 00:09:07,026
Our companies employ over
half a million people.

174
00:09:07,026 --> 00:09:10,026
In the last six months, the
way the economy has been going,

175
00:09:10,026 --> 00:09:12,996
I've been forced to put
about 50,000 men and women

176
00:09:12,996 --> 00:09:16,566
out of work. Now some of
them will blame Carnelian

177
00:09:16,566 --> 00:09:17,566
for their misfortunes, I'm
sure. It's understandable.

178
00:09:17,566 --> 00:09:20,696
- Does that bother you, personally? 
- It most certainly does. I am concerned

179
00:09:20,696 --> 00:09:23,466
about security just
like anyone else.

180
00:09:23,466 --> 00:09:26,466
- I don't consider myself bulletproof. 
- That's not what I meant.

181
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:30,226
I meant, does it bother you that these
people are out of work on your say-so?

182
00:09:30,226 --> 00:09:34,926
No. That's my job... To
make the tough decisions.

183
00:09:34,926 --> 00:09:36,996
Tough, yet rational and ethical.

184
00:09:36,996 --> 00:09:40,026
And, yes, I'm afraid people
will suffer because of it.

185
00:09:40,026 --> 00:09:41,566
So it's no surprise

186
00:09:41,566 --> 00:09:44,296
That someone's making
a stand against you.

187
00:09:44,296 --> 00:09:46,666
No, there's always
malcontents amongst us.

188
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:50,396
- I'll send you our register. 
- Oh, you have a register of malcontents?

189
00:09:50,396 --> 00:09:52,396
Anyone who's ever sued
us or threatened to sue us

190
00:09:52,396 --> 00:09:54,396
or written hostile
letters, that sort of thing.

191
00:09:54,396 --> 00:09:57,696
- They're logged in the register. 
- It'd be good for us to take a look at that.

192
00:09:57,696 --> 00:09:59,626
Yeah.

193
00:09:59,626 --> 00:10:02,766
We'd like a list of everyone

194
00:10:02,766 --> 00:10:04,726
with an airport security pass.

195
00:10:04,726 --> 00:10:08,066
- Do you have a warrant? 
- It's not privileged information, ma'am.

196
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:11,126
You can give it to
us without prejudice.

197
00:10:11,126 --> 00:10:13,796
- Well, okay, if you're sure. 
- Yeah, I'm sure.

198
00:10:13,796 --> 00:10:17,296
If you could, uh, send it
to that address, please?

199
00:10:17,296 --> 00:10:19,896
Hi. You'll be getting the
airport list any second now.

200
00:10:19,896 --> 00:10:21,896
Okay.

201
00:10:21,896 --> 00:10:23,396
Got it.

202
00:10:23,396 --> 00:10:27,326
I'll cross-check it
against the Carnelian list.

203
00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:34,566
One name on both lists...

204
00:10:34,566 --> 00:10:37,126
Lee Skelling.

205
00:10:37,126 --> 00:10:40,996
- Lee Skelling? 
- Yeah, he works the baggage truck a couple days a week.

206
00:10:40,996 --> 00:10:43,396
- He's not here today. 
- Okay, thank you.

207
00:10:43,396 --> 00:10:45,196
- Thank you. 
- Thanks, Van Pelt.

208
00:10:45,196 --> 00:10:46,996
Yep.

209
00:10:46,996 --> 00:10:51,426
Sniveling lackey pigs is
what you are, you know that?

210
00:10:51,426 --> 00:10:53,626
- Damn lackeys! 
- Calm down, Lee.

211
00:10:53,626 --> 00:10:55,026
Make me.

212
00:10:55,026 --> 00:10:57,096
Stop right there! You
let him go right now,

213
00:10:57,096 --> 00:10:59,926
- You hear me? 
- It's not loaded!

214
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:02,326
Now you put that down
right now, you idiot.

215
00:11:02,326 --> 00:11:04,396
But, daddy!

216
00:11:04,396 --> 00:11:07,066
Get inside, boy.

217
00:11:12,396 --> 00:11:14,696
Scared the pants
off you, didn't he?

218
00:11:14,696 --> 00:11:16,926
Yeah, he did.

219
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,926
No, he didn't.

220
00:11:24,658 --> 00:11:26,298
Two years ago, you sent this letter

221
00:11:26,298 --> 00:11:27,728
to Carnelian headquarters.

222
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:30,398
"You greedy sons of
bitches ought to know better

223
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,898
than to outright steal from
decent American citizens

224
00:11:32,898 --> 00:11:35,198
like myself. You're no
better than scum in my book.

225
00:11:35,198 --> 00:11:37,958
You better pay up, or there's
gonna be consequences."

226
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:40,698
- You recall writing this letter? 
- Yes, I do.

227
00:11:40,698 --> 00:11:42,758
Tell me about it.

228
00:11:42,758 --> 00:11:45,728
Like the letter says, which
I wrote in a moment of anger,

229
00:11:45,728 --> 00:11:47,758
they stole from me,

230
00:11:47,758 --> 00:11:49,458
from my family.

231
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:53,198
Then when I called them on it,
they not only didn't pay me,

232
00:11:53,198 --> 00:11:55,098
they did their damnedest
to throw me in jail.

233
00:11:55,098 --> 00:11:58,428
- How'd they steal from you? 
- I used to work the line

234
00:11:58,428 --> 00:12:00,928
at Grant Aerospace.
Fan ducts for airliners.

235
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:03,228
They had a whole
incentive thing going.

236
00:12:03,228 --> 00:12:05,998
If a shop floor guy
comes up with an idea

237
00:12:05,998 --> 00:12:08,258
that saves costs
or speeds the line,

238
00:12:08,258 --> 00:12:11,028
He gets a bonus. $50,000.

239
00:12:11,028 --> 00:12:14,058
So I came up with an
improvement on the riveting gear

240
00:12:14,058 --> 00:12:16,358
that saved them 5
1/2 cents per unit.

241
00:12:16,358 --> 00:12:18,928
That's huge. So
50,000 for me, right?

242
00:12:18,928 --> 00:12:21,028
That's a lot of money.

243
00:12:21,028 --> 00:12:24,428
The C.E.O. shook my
hand. I had it in writing.

244
00:12:24,428 --> 00:12:27,658
Then Carnelian prime
buys Grant Aerospace.

245
00:12:27,658 --> 00:12:31,058
Come time to pay my
bonus, they welsh.

246
00:12:31,058 --> 00:12:33,928
I complained about
it. They sacked me.

247
00:12:33,928 --> 00:12:38,098
- What'd you do then? 
- Oh, I tried to take them to court.

248
00:12:38,098 --> 00:12:40,998
Me and one old, cross-eyed
lawyer out of the phone book

249
00:12:40,998 --> 00:12:42,998
Against 20 ivy league weasels.

250
00:12:42,998 --> 00:12:46,898
No contest. I didn't
even get a hearing.

251
00:12:46,898 --> 00:12:48,828
Sounds like a bad
injustice was done.

252
00:12:48,828 --> 00:12:50,828
Sounds like you have
a right to be angry.

253
00:12:50,828 --> 00:12:54,858
Yes, I do. I do have a right.

254
00:13:04,758 --> 00:13:07,428
Your friends already took
Lee. What do you want?

255
00:13:07,428 --> 00:13:10,258
Jessie Skelling?

256
00:13:10,258 --> 00:13:11,758
No, I'm Cindy Crawfod.

257
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:16,458
Jessie's on vacation to Mexico.

258
00:13:29,098 --> 00:13:30,298
Ma'am?

259
00:13:30,298 --> 00:13:32,358
I can't even look at you people.

260
00:13:32,358 --> 00:13:35,028
You make me so mad.

261
00:13:35,028 --> 00:13:37,398
Lee's done nothing. Nothing!

262
00:13:37,398 --> 00:13:39,498
Jessie, if your
husband is innocent,

263
00:13:39,498 --> 00:13:43,198
we're your best friends.
We'll prove he's innocent.

264
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:49,258
Will you help us?

265
00:13:50,228 --> 00:13:52,598
You want some water or a soda?

266
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:55,128
Some water sounds lovely.

267
00:13:55,128 --> 00:13:57,628
Where were you the
night before last,

268
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:01,098
- from 9:00 p.m. till 9:00 the next morning? 
- I was at work, and then I was at home.

269
00:14:01,098 --> 00:14:03,558
- At work at the airport? 
- Yes.

270
00:14:03,558 --> 00:14:06,458
And, yes, I could've
gotten into Spruell's hangar

271
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:09,298
and messed with that
parachute, but I didn't.

272
00:14:09,298 --> 00:14:12,298
Okay? I worked my
shift, I went home,

273
00:14:12,298 --> 00:14:13,528
and that's all I did.

274
00:14:13,528 --> 00:14:14,998
I didn't even know

275
00:14:14,998 --> 00:14:17,628
Those Carnelia people were
out there jumping that day.

276
00:14:17,628 --> 00:14:20,428
And you know what? I
wouldn't give a damn

277
00:14:20,428 --> 00:14:22,928
- Even if I did know. 
- No?

278
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:25,498
Okay, yeah, I would give a damn.

279
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:27,798
They could give me that money.

280
00:14:27,798 --> 00:14:31,098
It was peanuts to them. Nothing.

281
00:14:31,098 --> 00:14:33,598
Cut a man's chute?

282
00:14:33,598 --> 00:14:35,128
No.

283
00:14:35,128 --> 00:14:38,428
Four years with the rangers.
You're familiar with parachutes.

284
00:14:38,428 --> 00:14:40,758
Yes, I am.

285
00:14:40,758 --> 00:14:42,958
You ever been in the military, cho?

286
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,128
Yes.

287
00:14:44,128 --> 00:14:45,828
Then you know.

288
00:14:45,828 --> 00:14:48,758
I would chop a man's head
off and pee down his neck

289
00:14:48,758 --> 00:14:51,458
before I'd ever cut
his chute that way.

290
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:54,058
I mean...

291
00:14:54,058 --> 00:14:56,998
That's bad.

292
00:14:56,998 --> 00:14:59,898
That's out there.

293
00:14:59,898 --> 00:15:03,628
Lee is a god-fearing man.

294
00:15:03,628 --> 00:15:06,558
He wouldn't kill
somebody like that.

295
00:15:06,558 --> 00:15:07,828
No way.

296
00:15:07,828 --> 00:15:09,998
He was a soldier. He can kill.

297
00:15:09,998 --> 00:15:14,458
- For his country, not for himself. 
- What's the difference, you think?

298
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:17,358
I don't know, but it makes all
the difference in the world.

299
00:15:17,358 --> 00:15:20,628
You're very confident
of his innocence.

300
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:23,358
How can you be so sure?

301
00:15:23,358 --> 00:15:25,498
Cause I asked him if he did it,

302
00:15:25,498 --> 00:15:28,528
and he said, no, he didn't do it.

303
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:31,598
Ah. You suspected he
might indeed have done it.

304
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:34,898
- But he denied it. You believe him. 
- Lee don't lie to me.

305
00:15:34,898 --> 00:15:37,858
He'll cause me trouble and
grief a hundred which ways,

306
00:15:37,858 --> 00:15:39,928
but he don't lie to me.

307
00:15:39,928 --> 00:15:43,358
Wives often say that
about their husbands.

308
00:15:43,358 --> 00:15:47,328
Easy to fool yourself that
the people you love are honest.

309
00:15:47,798 --> 00:15:50,698
Yeah, it is.

310
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:53,558
- But I know he wouldn't lie. 
- Why?

311
00:15:53,558 --> 00:15:55,698
Because.

312
00:15:55,858 --> 00:15:57,058
Why?

313
00:15:57,058 --> 00:16:00,098
Because I'm dyin'.

314
00:16:00,728 --> 00:16:03,928
And he wouldn't want
to lie to somebody

315
00:16:03,928 --> 00:16:06,928
who's gonna sit next to
the almighty pretty soon.

316
00:16:06,928 --> 00:16:09,898
I'm sorry.

317
00:16:09,898 --> 00:16:11,858
Stuff happens.

318
00:16:11,858 --> 00:16:14,458
Don't worry about it.

319
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:19,528
The night before last,
what time did Lee get home?

320
00:16:19,528 --> 00:16:23,228
Same time as every night.
About half past midnight.

321
00:16:23,228 --> 00:16:25,858
Um...

322
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,998
Yeah.

323
00:16:35,798 --> 00:16:38,128
My husband did not do this thing.

324
00:16:38,128 --> 00:16:42,298
If he went to jail, what
would happen to the kids?

325
00:16:42,298 --> 00:16:46,798
They'd go into care.

326
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:50,398
And he wouldn't do that to me.

327
00:16:50,398 --> 00:16:53,928
He wouldn't.

328
00:16:53,928 --> 00:16:57,058
Thank you for your time.

329
00:16:58,528 --> 00:17:02,098
Your wife said you
wouldn't do that to her.

330
00:17:02,098 --> 00:17:03,728
I don't know.

331
00:17:03,728 --> 00:17:06,998
Maybe if you thought you could
get away with it, you would.

332
00:17:06,998 --> 00:17:09,528
When I was working
at Grant Aerospace,

333
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,198
Jessie was getting the best
treatment for her sickness.

334
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,798
If I hadn't made a
nuisance of myself,

335
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:18,228
I'd still have my job
and my health insurance.

336
00:17:18,228 --> 00:17:20,428
Jessie'd be okay.

337
00:17:20,428 --> 00:17:24,658
So why did I bitch and moan, right?

338
00:17:24,658 --> 00:17:27,298
I mean, why couldn't
I just be quiet,

339
00:17:27,298 --> 00:17:29,928
keep my job?

340
00:17:31,058 --> 00:17:33,458
I don't know.

341
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:36,658
Ego and pride...

342
00:17:36,658 --> 00:17:39,798
and vanity, I expect.

343
00:17:40,058 --> 00:17:44,328
Yeah, I guess something like that.

344
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:50,028
But if I thought I
could get away with it,

345
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:52,028
yes, I would kill

346
00:17:52,028 --> 00:17:55,428
every last one of those bastards.

347
00:17:55,428 --> 00:17:59,598
But you can't kill rich
people and get away with it.

348
00:18:00,828 --> 00:18:02,858
Everybody knows that.

349
00:18:02,858 --> 00:18:05,028
I know, I can read your mind.

350
00:18:05,028 --> 00:18:06,298
Oh, you can, really?

351
00:18:06,298 --> 00:18:08,258
You're thinking that
Mr. Skelling is innocent

352
00:18:08,258 --> 00:18:10,798
- and we should release him. Cho! 
- That's amazing.

353
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,598
That's exactly what I was thinking.

354
00:18:12,598 --> 00:18:15,098
How do you do that? Let me try.

355
00:18:15,098 --> 00:18:17,098
You're thinking, "Jane is right.

356
00:18:17,098 --> 00:18:19,658
The man is innocent.
We should let him go."

357
00:18:19,658 --> 00:18:21,758
No, I just think you
want him to be innocent

358
00:18:21,758 --> 00:18:24,058
because his guilt
would be too simple.

359
00:18:24,058 --> 00:18:27,658
- He has motive, opportunity and no alibi. 
- Yeah...

360
00:18:27,658 --> 00:18:30,228
- Yeah, boss? 
- Let Lee Skelling go.

361
00:18:30,228 --> 00:18:32,498
- You sure? 
- We have no hard evidence against him.

362
00:18:32,498 --> 00:18:33,998
Okay. Will do.

363
00:18:33,998 --> 00:18:37,098
We should go and talk to the
Carnelian executives again.

364
00:18:37,098 --> 00:18:39,698
- Throw a cat among the pigeons. 
- You think? Why?

365
00:18:39,698 --> 00:18:42,328
Well, what if this is not about
what it looks like it's about?

366
00:18:42,328 --> 00:18:45,258
- What if it's about something else entirely? 
- Like?

367
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:49,098
- I don't know. 
- So you're suggesting we throw a blind cat among the pigeons.

368
00:18:49,098 --> 00:18:52,398
- Yeah. 
- No.

369
00:19:13,928 --> 00:19:15,598
Howdy.

370
00:19:15,598 --> 00:19:18,158
I understand that you
released a promising suspect.

371
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:20,198
Ah, we didn't like him for it.

372
00:19:20,198 --> 00:19:22,828
We think... well,
that is, I think...

373
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,498
Agent Lisbon disagrees with me.

374
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:28,998
- I think the answer lies with one of you here. 
- But that's absurd.

375
00:19:28,998 --> 00:19:33,528
- Why? 
- You think one of us sabotaged David's parachute?

376
00:19:33,528 --> 00:19:35,598
Why not? He chutes
were clearly numbered.

377
00:19:35,598 --> 00:19:38,398
The saboteur would
simply have to make sure

378
00:19:38,398 --> 00:19:41,898
- not to choose the dud. 
- But how could they know who would pick the dud?

379
00:19:41,898 --> 00:19:44,958
They'd be killing a
randomly selected colleague.

380
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:48,758
- Why would anyone want to do that? 
- Yes. I don't know. We'll find out.

381
00:19:48,758 --> 00:19:51,158
So tell us a little
about yourselves.

382
00:19:51,158 --> 00:19:54,528
Let's use this sadness to get
some real truths, shall we?

383
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:56,298
Joyce, you first.

384
00:19:56,298 --> 00:19:58,628
Me first to do what, exactly?

385
00:19:58,628 --> 00:20:01,128
I'll tell you what I think,
just to get the ball rolling.

386
00:20:01,128 --> 00:20:03,958
I think you've made
your way in the world

387
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:07,628
by concealing your true feelings
under a mask of positivity

388
00:20:07,628 --> 00:20:09,158
and niceness, but underneath,

389
00:20:09,158 --> 00:20:13,658
you're a seething mass of
ugly, bitter resentment.

390
00:20:14,228 --> 00:20:16,958
You think Faulk is
a stupid buffoon,

391
00:20:16,988 --> 00:20:21,228
- But you're far too clever to be brave enough to tell him so. 
- How dare you?

392
00:20:21,228 --> 00:20:24,058
And, you, Mr. Braemar...
Marine corps, yes?

393
00:20:24,058 --> 00:20:25,288
Yes.

394
00:20:25,288 --> 00:20:27,828
Yeah. Office politics
must seem kinda trivial

395
00:20:27,828 --> 00:20:29,528
in comparison.

396
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:33,858
How often do you fantasize
about pulling a couple of weapons

397
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,228
and showing these
civilians a little reality?

398
00:20:35,228 --> 00:20:37,688
That is baseless and inappropriate,

399
00:20:37,688 --> 00:20:39,228
and I resent it.

400
00:20:39,228 --> 00:20:41,488
Agent lisbon, this is
a high-profile case,

401
00:20:41,488 --> 00:20:43,988
a career-making case, if
concluded successfully.

402
00:20:43,988 --> 00:20:46,528
Is this how you wish to proceed...

403
00:20:46,528 --> 00:20:51,228
- with clownish games? 
- I apologize. Mr. Jane is a consultant.

404
00:20:51,228 --> 00:20:52,558
His statements in no way

405
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:54,688
reflect the official
view Of the CBI.

406
00:20:54,688 --> 00:20:57,588
I am simply trying
to get a full picture

407
00:20:57,588 --> 00:21:00,588
of the group dynamic here, for
instance, does anyone resent

408
00:21:00,588 --> 00:21:04,128
the sexual relationship between
Faulk and Miss Sobell here?

409
00:21:04,128 --> 00:21:06,458
Anyone?

410
00:21:10,328 --> 00:21:12,358
Why would anyone resent it?

411
00:21:12,358 --> 00:21:14,458
Don't engage with him, Nadia.

412
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:18,788
- Oh, you let him tell you what to do. 
- That's enough.

413
00:21:18,788 --> 00:21:20,758
You can go now.

414
00:21:20,758 --> 00:21:22,558
Yes, we can.

415
00:21:27,388 --> 00:21:29,528
You threw a cat, all right?

416
00:21:29,528 --> 00:21:32,528
What valuable insight
did you glean as a result?

417
00:21:32,528 --> 00:21:33,988
Nothing.

418
00:21:33,988 --> 00:21:36,028
It's a little disappointing.

419
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:39,028
Well, maybe, just maybe this case

420
00:21:39,028 --> 00:21:41,028
is exactly what it
looks like it's about.

421
00:21:41,028 --> 00:21:43,988
Bitter suburbs with a
grudge against the fat cats.

422
00:21:43,988 --> 00:21:45,988
Nice drive, though.

423
00:21:45,988 --> 00:21:48,288
Nice 3-hour drive.

424
00:21:48,288 --> 00:21:50,628
- I am hungry. 
- You hungry?

425
00:21:59,758 --> 00:22:02,458
- Ready? 
- Ready.

426
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:06,458
You know what's weird
about those guys?

427
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,458
None of them seem to give a damn.

428
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:10,788
A colleague of theirs
falls out of the sky,

429
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:13,688
and they seem okay with it.
Is that guilt or indifference?

430
00:22:13,688 --> 00:22:15,928
Corporate brainwashing
turns them into robots.

431
00:22:15,928 --> 00:22:18,828
Grief isn't productive,
and that's all.

432
00:22:18,828 --> 00:22:21,558
I don't buy that. People
make up their own minds.

433
00:22:21,558 --> 00:22:24,188
- You can't brainwash them. 
- Oh, sure you can.

434
00:22:24,188 --> 00:22:26,558
That's what these corporate
retreats are all about.

435
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:28,728
It's primitive brainwashing
via group suffering.

436
00:22:28,728 --> 00:22:32,658
It's like office Karaoke
or, uh, fraternity hazing.

437
00:22:32,658 --> 00:22:34,088
How so?

438
00:22:34,088 --> 00:22:36,358
Oh, when the individual
is humiliated,

439
00:22:36,358 --> 00:22:39,058
their perceived value
of the group is raised.

440
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:41,058
I went on a retreat

441
00:22:41,058 --> 00:22:43,228
when I got promoted
to head of the unit.

442
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:45,458
I mean, I wasn't humiliated.
I wasn't brainwashed.

443
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:47,288
So you say.

444
00:22:47,288 --> 00:22:49,328
I wasn't. It was useful, actually.

445
00:22:49,328 --> 00:22:51,458
How so?

446
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:53,788
Learning about communication
and leadership skills,

447
00:22:53,788 --> 00:22:57,528
building trust... something
you could profit from.

448
00:22:57,528 --> 00:23:00,088
What does that mean?

449
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:02,388
Like you don't know you
have major trust issues.

450
00:23:02,388 --> 00:23:05,928
I trust people. I trust you.

451
00:23:05,928 --> 00:23:08,658
No, you don't. I
don't trust you either.

452
00:23:12,728 --> 00:23:15,428
That's upsetting to hear that.

453
00:23:15,428 --> 00:23:18,488
And really, you don't trust me?

454
00:23:18,488 --> 00:23:21,328
Of course not. How many
times have you lied to me,

455
00:23:21,328 --> 00:23:24,388
misled me, tricked
me? Is that trust? No.

456
00:23:24,388 --> 00:23:27,058
Well, we have to remedy
this. Let's do a trust fall.

457
00:23:27,058 --> 00:23:29,058
A trust fall?

458
00:23:29,058 --> 00:23:31,528
Yeah. I'm sure you did
one on your CBI retreat.

459
00:23:31,528 --> 00:23:33,688
It's when you turn
around and fall backward,

460
00:23:33,688 --> 00:23:36,358
- and I catch you. 
- Oh, yes, we did do that.

461
00:23:36,358 --> 00:23:37,858
- Mm-hmm.
 - No.

462
00:23:37,858 --> 00:23:40,058
- You won't? 
- We have a long drive still.

463
00:23:40,058 --> 00:23:42,388
Ah. Here we have two co-workers
recognizing the boundaries

464
00:23:42,388 --> 00:23:44,158
of their professional relationship.

465
00:23:44,158 --> 00:23:46,788
See, you want to trust me,

466
00:23:46,788 --> 00:23:51,188
- But there's something holding you back. 
- Yes. You're untrustworthy. It's my job not to trust you.

467
00:23:51,188 --> 00:23:54,228
Lisbon, I want you to
know that you can trust me.

468
00:23:54,228 --> 00:23:56,558
No matter what happens,
I will be there for you.

469
00:23:56,558 --> 00:23:59,458
I will. I need you to know that.

470
00:24:01,328 --> 00:24:03,558
- Now can I catch you? 
- Come on.

471
00:24:03,558 --> 00:24:05,388
Please?

472
00:24:05,388 --> 00:24:06,688
Fine.

473
00:24:09,588 --> 00:24:13,128
Come on.

474
00:24:13,128 --> 00:24:16,488
See, you can trust me.

475
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:19,028
Oh, wow. That worked.
Suddenly, I trust you.

476
00:24:19,028 --> 00:24:20,288
Uh-huh.

477
00:24:20,288 --> 00:24:22,728
I allow you to drive
me around this country

478
00:24:22,728 --> 00:24:24,888
in this contraption.
That's serious trust.

479
00:24:36,528 --> 00:24:38,228
Talk to me.

480
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:40,658
Mm. Do I have to?

481
00:24:40,658 --> 00:24:42,928
No. I can just fall asleep,

482
00:24:42,928 --> 00:24:45,628
and we can drift
into oncoming traffic.

483
00:24:45,628 --> 00:24:47,758
Your call.

484
00:24:51,628 --> 00:24:54,288
Have you seen any
good movies lately?

485
00:24:54,288 --> 00:24:57,128
No. You?

486
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:59,428
No.

487
00:25:01,328 --> 00:25:03,728
Interesting.

488
00:25:18,388 --> 00:25:21,188
Lisbon, we just got another
message from Joe Q. Public.

489
00:25:21,188 --> 00:25:24,158
"when all go to bed, they'd
best say their good-byes."

490
00:25:24,158 --> 00:25:28,188
"when all go to bed, they'd'
Best say their good-byes."

491
00:25:28,188 --> 00:25:30,358
"for prompt at my bidding,

492
00:25:30,358 --> 00:25:31,988
All things will rise."

493
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:35,028
"and the king of the rats

494
00:25:35,028 --> 00:25:37,688
will meet his demise."

495
00:25:37,688 --> 00:25:39,658
Signed, Joe Q. Public.

496
00:25:39,658 --> 00:25:41,828
- Is that all? 
- Yeah, that's all.

497
00:25:41,828 --> 00:25:44,728
- Okay. 
- Okay, bye.

498
00:25:44,728 --> 00:25:48,258
Now he's writing bad poetry.

499
00:25:48,258 --> 00:25:52,558
What does that mean,
"all things will rise"?

500
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:54,058
Oh.

501
00:26:04,428 --> 00:26:06,288
What? What does it mean?

502
00:26:06,288 --> 00:26:08,328
He's planted a bomb to kill Faulk.

503
00:26:41,608 --> 00:26:42,538
What the hell?

504
00:26:44,046 --> 00:26:45,416
What are you doing here?

505
00:26:45,416 --> 00:26:48,646
- Bear with us, Mr. Faulk, we have reason to believe... 
- Yeah, there it is.

506
00:26:49,246 --> 00:26:49,846
Told you so.

507
00:26:49,846 --> 00:26:51,716
- There's what? 
- There's no need to gloat.

508
00:26:51,716 --> 00:26:55,116
Mr. Faulk, there is an
explosive device of some kind

509
00:26:55,116 --> 00:26:56,946
- under your bed. 
- Oh, my God!

510
00:26:56,946 --> 00:26:58,616
- Wait. 
- What do you mean, "wait"?

511
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:00,716
Just let me get a better look.

512
00:27:00,716 --> 00:27:02,916
No, I don't think there's
a pressure trigger.

513
00:27:02,916 --> 00:27:04,686
- You can get up now. 
- You don't think?

514
00:27:04,686 --> 00:27:07,316
Well, I'm sure it doesn't.
The timer's set to go off

515
00:27:07,316 --> 00:27:09,786
in ten minutes, so we
have plenty of time.

516
00:27:09,786 --> 00:27:11,946
If you'll just get
out of the bed slowly.

517
00:27:11,946 --> 00:27:15,586
- We do not want to jar the device in any way. 
- Boom!

518
00:27:15,586 --> 00:27:17,586
For god sakes!

519
00:27:17,586 --> 00:27:20,316
Sorry. Couldn't resist.

520
00:27:38,146 --> 00:27:40,116
She's a nasty little girl.

521
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:43,286
Anyone inside of 20 feet
would have been a red mist.

522
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:45,816
- See this wire right here? 
- Mm.

523
00:27:45,816 --> 00:27:49,216
Yeah, it came loose at
some point, disarmed her.

524
00:27:49,216 --> 00:27:52,686
- Silly mistake. 
- Lucky, huh?

525
00:27:52,686 --> 00:27:55,116
Don't touch that. Even
though it's disarmed,

526
00:27:55,116 --> 00:27:57,686
if you touch the red
terminal, We're all barbecue.

527
00:27:57,686 --> 00:28:00,416
Oh. That's good to know.

528
00:28:00,416 --> 00:28:02,316
Looks like expert work.

529
00:28:02,316 --> 00:28:05,546
Absolutely. We've got
high-test army ordnance

530
00:28:05,546 --> 00:28:07,346
combined with a
hobby store trigger.

531
00:28:07,346 --> 00:28:09,516
Whoever built this thing
really knows his onions.

532
00:28:09,516 --> 00:28:11,316
Army ordnance?

533
00:28:11,316 --> 00:28:13,686
Yeah. You've got the
innards of five mark I-9

534
00:28:13,686 --> 00:28:15,686
army issue grenades
packed together.

535
00:28:19,046 --> 00:28:21,046
Soon as he heard about the bomb,

536
00:28:21,046 --> 00:28:22,946
He knew you people would be on him.

537
00:28:22,946 --> 00:28:25,416
So he grabbed his gear,
and he lit out of here.

538
00:28:25,416 --> 00:28:27,416
How did he know about the bomb?

539
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:29,246
I told him.

540
00:28:29,246 --> 00:28:32,646
- Listen to the police scanner. 
- Kind of a hobby.

541
00:28:32,646 --> 00:28:36,016
- You hear some things, My God. 
- Where did he go?

542
00:28:36,016 --> 00:28:38,516
- His truck's still here. 
- Friend gave him a ride.

543
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:40,946
- Friend's name? 
- Sure, like I'm gonna tell you.

544
00:28:40,946 --> 00:28:43,416
Lee is only making
things worse by running.

545
00:28:43,416 --> 00:28:44,886
Right.

546
00:28:44,886 --> 00:28:48,616
He said he tell you
that he is 100% innocent.

547
00:28:48,616 --> 00:28:51,346
He didn't do it.
But that's no matter

548
00:28:51,346 --> 00:28:55,086
- once the law gets ahold of you. 
- Do you know where he's gone to?

549
00:28:55,086 --> 00:28:58,046
- Wouldn't you like to know. 
- Oh, I know. I'm just wondering if you do.

550
00:28:58,046 --> 00:29:00,046
- Yeah? Where'd he go? 
- Mountains.

551
00:29:00,046 --> 00:29:02,286
Hmm. Well, you're
welcome to look for him.

552
00:29:02,286 --> 00:29:06,086
- You won't find him. 
- I bet you're right. Capable man, your husband.

553
00:29:06,086 --> 00:29:08,186
- Yes, he is. 
- Is he armed?

554
00:29:08,186 --> 00:29:11,386
If he is, it's for
huntin' and nothing else.

555
00:29:11,386 --> 00:29:14,886
Send him my best wishes
next time you speak to him.

556
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:16,346
I will.

557
00:29:22,916 --> 00:29:25,216
Damn it. I should
have never let him go.

558
00:29:25,216 --> 00:29:28,446
- He didn't do it. 
- Maybe he didn't, but it sure looks like he did.

559
00:29:28,446 --> 00:29:32,516
Rigsby, put out an
A.P.B. on Lee Skelling.

560
00:29:32,516 --> 00:29:35,486
He's armed and dangerous,
headed for the mountain regions.

561
00:29:35,486 --> 00:29:37,746
Didn't do it.

562
00:29:38,002 --> 00:29:40,002
Carnelian is a company

563
00:29:40,002 --> 00:29:42,442
founded on good, American values.

564
00:29:42,442 --> 00:29:44,742
We will be a better
company because of this,

565
00:29:44,742 --> 00:29:46,772
and the sick individual
behind this campaign

566
00:29:46,772 --> 00:29:49,242
against us will not
affect us in any way.

567
00:29:49,242 --> 00:29:52,072
we will not be intimidated.

568
00:29:52,072 --> 00:29:55,242
- Fool. Playing the hero. He'll get himself killed. 
- He has to act tough.

569
00:29:55,242 --> 00:29:57,402
Carnelian needs to turn
this to their P.R. advantage,

570
00:29:57,402 --> 00:30:00,302
- or their business will lose a lot of money. 
- How's Carnelian's stock price?

571
00:30:00,302 --> 00:30:02,642
Down 15% since Whittaker's
death and still dropping.

572
00:30:02,642 --> 00:30:05,342
Wow. Wonder whether anyone
made money off the drop.

573
00:30:05,342 --> 00:30:08,142
- Shortiti the stock, you mean. 
- Yeah. If you'd known beforehand

574
00:30:08,142 --> 00:30:10,772
that Carnelian was gonna
be targeted by Joe Public.

575
00:30:10,772 --> 00:30:13,402
Because you are Joe Public,
then betting against them

576
00:30:13,402 --> 00:30:15,772
- on the market is easy money. 
- Well, it can't be Skelling, then.

577
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:18,842
- He's got no money to bet with. 
- Well, it's not Skelling. We know that already.

578
00:30:18,842 --> 00:30:23,102
You know that. We're
keeping an open mind.

579
00:30:23,102 --> 00:30:25,302
On it. I'll run the
market trading logs,

580
00:30:25,302 --> 00:30:28,442
see if anybody made a
killing, so to speak.

581
00:30:33,672 --> 00:30:37,402
- Any word on Skelling? 
- A couple of potential sightings in the Mt. Whitney area.

582
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:39,972
Locals and park services are
all over it. We'll get him.

583
00:30:39,972 --> 00:30:42,472
I doubt it. Skelling's
in his element up there...

584
00:30:42,472 --> 00:30:45,202
His survivalist
fantasy life come true.

585
00:30:45,202 --> 00:30:47,302
He's gone to ground
like a grizzly bear.

586
00:30:47,302 --> 00:30:48,842
Eureka.

587
00:30:48,842 --> 00:30:51,442
I found a trading account
that made a series of moves

588
00:30:51,442 --> 00:30:53,642
in the market against
Carnelian stock.

589
00:30:53,642 --> 00:30:57,802
- The trades exactly mirror our time line. 
- Is there a name attached to the account?

590
00:30:57,802 --> 00:31:00,502
There's a subsidiary
track... to a British bank...

591
00:31:00,502 --> 00:31:03,772
A company account in the
name of N.S. Holdings.

592
00:31:03,772 --> 00:31:06,542
N.S... Nadia Sobell.

593
00:31:06,542 --> 00:31:09,542
Aha.

594
00:31:09,542 --> 00:31:11,542
We're looking for Nadia Sobell.

595
00:31:11,542 --> 00:31:14,542
- She's out on the mountain with the others playing war. 
- War?

596
00:31:14,542 --> 00:31:17,302
Yeah, you know, with
those paintball guns.

597
00:31:17,302 --> 00:31:19,472
You divide into teams,
you get dressed up,

598
00:31:19,472 --> 00:31:22,172
And you creep around
trying to kill each other.

599
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:25,372
It's actually a lot of fun, if
only I hadn't twisted my ankle.

600
00:31:25,372 --> 00:31:29,342
So, um, what do you guys
want to talk to Nadia for?

601
00:31:58,172 --> 00:32:02,702
Whoo!

602
00:32:02,702 --> 00:32:05,672
Aah! Aah!

603
00:32:05,672 --> 00:32:08,072
Nadia?

604
00:32:08,072 --> 00:32:11,972
Hey!

605
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:14,902
Nadia? My God!

606
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:46,549
What do we have?

607
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:48,819
The body went to the
lab a couple hours ago.

608
00:32:48,819 --> 00:32:51,219
Local PD's working a grid
search of the crime scene.

609
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:54,679
- Any word on Skelling? 
- Nothing recent, but the last good sighting we had of him

610
00:32:54,679 --> 00:32:57,819
was midmorning at a trailhead
3.5 miles from the ridge

611
00:32:57,819 --> 00:33:02,419
- where Sobell was shot. Time line says he could have made it easy. 
- Coincidence. He didn't do it.

612
00:33:02,419 --> 00:33:04,379
We don't... Never mind.

613
00:33:04,379 --> 00:33:07,049
- Whoever did this thinks we're idiots. 
- Yes. A mistake.

614
00:33:07,049 --> 00:33:09,919
How so? We certainly
look like idiots

615
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:11,919
When our number one suspect

616
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,549
- gets shot practically right in front of us. 
- Not in front of us.

617
00:33:14,549 --> 00:33:17,379
- Any messages From Joe Public? 
- Not a word. - Won't hear from him.

618
00:33:17,684 --> 00:33:20,414
- That disguise has grown boring, I suspect. 
- What,you think Joe Public's a ruse?

619
00:33:20,414 --> 00:33:23,244
So what's the motive for killing
Whittaker and Sobell then?

620
00:33:23,244 --> 00:33:25,244
Yes, well, that's the question.

621
00:33:25,244 --> 00:33:27,244
Whittaker's death was random.

622
00:33:27,244 --> 00:33:29,914
Any one of them could
have taken the dud chute.

623
00:33:29,914 --> 00:33:32,244
But Sobell's wasn't.
What does that tell us?

624
00:33:32,244 --> 00:33:34,984
What? We give up.

625
00:33:34,984 --> 00:33:37,384
Well, I'm not entirely sure.

626
00:33:37,384 --> 00:33:39,784
Are Faulk and the
others still inside?

627
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:41,744
Yeah.

628
00:33:45,114 --> 00:33:47,044
What's in the bag?

629
00:33:47,044 --> 00:33:48,944
Oh. Picnic lunch.

630
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:51,444
- What's in the bag? 
- A bomb.

631
00:33:51,444 --> 00:33:53,544
Ha ha. What's in
the bag?   Seriously.

632
00:33:53,544 --> 00:33:55,744
Seriously, a bomb.

633
00:33:57,819 --> 00:33:59,459
What happened?

634
00:33:59,459 --> 00:34:02,459
Sobell and I were competing
against De Shaun and Joyce.

635
00:34:02,459 --> 00:34:04,619
I was tracking Joyce
when I heard the shot.

636
00:34:04,619 --> 00:34:08,189
And then I heard De Shaun
yelling from over the ridge.

637
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:13,230
Mr. Faulk? Your cars are here,
and the baggage is loaded.

638
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:16,170
- Thank you, Jake. 
- You're leaving?

639
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:18,170
Yes. It was a mistake to stay.

640
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:20,630
I was tempting fate
to prove a point,

641
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:23,100
And now poor Nadia has
paid for it. It's too much.

642
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,030
You can't blame yourself.

643
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,870
Why not?

644
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:30,130
- Excuse me? 
- No, that's all right.

645
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:33,030
The barb is well-placed.
I've been wrong.

646
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:35,570
The company's been wrong.

647
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:39,700
- I need to issue a statement, make an apology. 
- No, no. You can't let this psycho win.

648
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:42,700
No,no,no. Not to Joe Public,
to the general public,

649
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,770
To the people. Carnelian
is going to change its ways

650
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:48,200
and become a better company,
redeemed by its suffering,

651
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,000
reborn, rebranded,
ethical, honest, clean.

652
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,570
- That's brilliant. 
- Yes, it is. It's brilliant.

653
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:56,400
No, it's just necessary.

654
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,600
However, I want a
campaign on those themes

655
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,130
- ready by next week. 
- I'll get someone working on it.

656
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:03,130
Hey, uh, phone call from Van Pelt.

657
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:05,070
Forensics got a hit on the bullet

658
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:07,070
that was taken out of Sobell.

659
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:09,100
It's a boat tail
.264 caliber bullet

660
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:12,000
Manufactured by Winchester in
1989 as part of a custom batch

661
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
To be given to the
top ten finalists

662
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,970
In the annual American
Cowboy Shootist Competition

663
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:18,930
- In Reno, Nevada. 
- You're kidding.

664
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:21,100
Let me guess... Jake Cooby.

665
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,770
- Seventh place. 
- Jake Cooby?

666
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:25,400
The ranch manager?

667
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,800
Of course. It all
adds up. It's perfect.

668
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,370
- It is? 
- Why would Cooby want to kill somebody?

669
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:32,470
Well, let's go ask him.

670
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:35,930
Mr. Faulk? Where does
Mr. Cooby put his feet up?

671
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:38,170
The staff kitchen.

672
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:40,170
Ah. Thank you.

673
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:42,400
Uh, wait. Why is Jake involved?

674
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,130
Uh, the bullet that killed Nadia...

675
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:47,130
apparently very special,

676
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:50,370
- almost certainly belongs to Mr. Cooby. 
- Jake? Can't be.

677
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:53,770
- You know him well, don't you? 
- Yeah. I've been coming here for six years.

678
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:55,770
We're good friends.
This is a good man.

679
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:58,200
Salt of the earth. This can't be.

680
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,300
Forensics doesn't lie.

681
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,630
He never expressed
animosity towards you?

682
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,130
No, never.

683
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:07,230
Must be a secret grudge.

684
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:09,970
Staff kitchen, you said, this way?

685
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,270
Maybe you can help us.

686
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:18,170
- Well,of course. Anything I can do... 
- Come with me when I talk to Mr. Cooby.

687
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:19,900
- All right. 
- Okay.

688
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:23,100
Hold on. I don't think
that's such a good idea.

689
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,430
Well, it's him that
Cooby's angry with.

690
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:27,930
- Let's use that, vex him, Open him up a little. 
- Maybe it'll work, but it's too risky.

691
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:29,970
You can wait outside
with your gun drawn

692
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:32,600
in case Cooby gets
a little haywire.

693
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:40,470
You saying it's me?  I shot her?

694
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:42,630
Yes, and cut Whittaker's parachute

695
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:47,200
- And planted the bomb that almost killed Mr. Faulk here. 
- I surely did not.

696
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,170
Jeez! Why in heck
would I do all that?

697
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:52,700
- That's what we'd like to know. 
- Are you guys for real?

698
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:55,830
Come on. How long have
you known me, Mr. Faulk?

699
00:36:55,830 --> 00:37:00,070
Why, Jake? What did I ever
do to you to justify this?

700
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:02,200
Help me understand.

701
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,800
Okay, now see here...

702
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,030
I don't know how, but you
got the wrong idea about me.

703
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:10,030
Is that right?

704
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:12,970
Then why was it that
one of your prize bullets

705
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:15,170
- killed Nadia Sobell? 
- It was?

706
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:18,200
And why did you build
this clever thing, huh?

707
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:21,370
- What? Is that a bomb? 
- Yes, Jake, it's your bomb.

708
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:24,670
- You made it. 
- No, I didn't! What have you been smokin', man?

709
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:27,930
Really? No, it's not?
This is not your trigger?

710
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:29,970
Uh...

711
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:31,500
- For God's sakes! 
- Is that...

712
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,470
It's okay. Everyone just
stay calm. It's no problem.

713
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:37,230
I'm pretty sure you disarm it

714
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:40,330
by removing this wire
from the red terminal.

715
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:42,670
No! Idiot.

716
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:45,700
There. What the hell
are you playin' at?

717
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,570
Aha... As they say.

718
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:52,930
- What are you talkin' about? 
- You knew how to disarm the bomb

719
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:55,070
because you made it.

720
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:59,200
You planted it to divert
suspicion from yourself.

721
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,900
Ergo, it was you that
killed Whittaker and Sobell.

722
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:06,370
I hate to spoil your theory,

723
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:08,970
but it's obvious how
to disarm the bomb.

724
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:12,100
No, it wasn't. I bet 90% of
people would think to remove

725
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:15,200
- this wire here, that'd be the right thing to do. 
- No!

726
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,200
The bomb squad took
out the explosive.

727
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,600
That's just play-doh,
and you are a wretched,

728
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,800
scheming, cold-hearted murderer.

729
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,300
- Where do you keep your tea, Mr. Cooby? 
- Uh, in the cabinet.

730
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,400
- You're mad. 
- Thank you.

731
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,870
Oh, uh, and could you please
ask Agent Lisbon to come in?

732
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:32,870
Thanks, Mr. Cooby.

733
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:37,630
You have no legal proof whatsoever.

734
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:41,200
Eh. Legal proof will
be found, no doubt.

735
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,170
But personally, I don't need it.

736
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:47,930
I just like to know that I'm right.

737
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:51,230
Sir, put your hands
behind your back.

738
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:54,130
You're under arrest.

739
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:56,130
Let's go.

740
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:12,430
I knew it was you

741
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:15,330
as soon as the bomb under
your bed failed to go off.

742
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:18,470
It was too clever, Randy. Too clever. 
- Don't call me Randy.

743
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:20,830
But why would you
randomly want to kill

744
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:22,770
one of your own executives?

745
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:25,470
- Doesn't make sense. 
- Then Sobell was shot,

746
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:29,600
and I saw your whole game. Randy.

747
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,800
That's very childish.

748
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,000
Whittaker's death was
merely a camouflage

749
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,870
to disguise Sobell's death.

750
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:38,130
She's who you needed dead.

751
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:41,400
I won't say anything
until my lawyer arrives.

752
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:45,100
Suffice to say, you have no proof.

753
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,930
The question is, what
did Sobell have on you?

754
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:50,070
What was she going to do?

755
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,700
Nothing.

756
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:54,170
That was a rhetorical question.

757
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:56,630
We know everything we need to now.

758
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:59,500
This is an affidavit from
Nadia Sobell's lawyer.

759
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,570
Nadia was secretly
negotiating to join K.B.T.,

760
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:04,070
Your number one rival.

761
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:06,830
She was also drafting a sexual
harassment suit against you

762
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:08,800
to coincide with her departure.

763
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,830
That's why she was
shorting Carnelian Stock,

764
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:12,070
and that's why you
needed to kill her.

765
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:15,100
Because nobody gets on top
of Randall Faulk, do they?

766
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,270
Nobody.

767
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:19,670
Where's my lawyer?

768
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:23,300
But I gotta tell you, the
whole Joe Q. Public ruse...

769
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:26,170
Genius.

770
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:28,170
I couldn't see how you could profit

771
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:31,900
from attacking your own company.
But you, you have vision...

772
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,270
Carnelian reborn and rebranded.

773
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:36,070
Everybody loves a comeback.

774
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:39,630
Everybody loves redemption.

775
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:42,730
You have nothing.

776
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:45,270
We have enough to rip you
to pieces. And you know it.

777
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:50,030
So before your lawyer gets
here and ties everybody's hands,

778
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:52,400
let's make a deal.

779
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:58,870
I'm listening.

780
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:02,430
Good. We'll call
Whittaker Manslaughter One.

781
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:05,630
We'll forget about the bomb.

782
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:08,770
And we won't go after
the death penalty.

783
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:15,630
In exchange for what?

784
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,630
Bills...

785
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:26,630
What is this?

786
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:46,330
Oh!

787
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:49,170
Oh, my God!

788
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:52,470
Reba, look at this!

789
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:54,470
Can you believe that? Oh, my god!

790
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:57,500
Oh, sweetheart!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
