Temple of Harmony

5
00:00:29,608 --> 00:00:30,905
Rosemary, please don't go.

6
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,675
I'm only trying to help.
I'm not listening to you anymore

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,070
Rosemary, you're in serious danger.
I'm not listening.

8
00:01:01,097 --> 00:01:02,102
No!

9
00:01:27,773 --> 00:01:29,715
Thank you for coming so quickly.

10
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,360
Your victim is the
widow of macon tennant

11
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,955
Founder of calsure financial...

12
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,695
Close friends of
the lieutenant governor.

13
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,995
Yeah, we got to use the chopper.
Cool. Well, we have two witnesses

14
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,405
Who saw a silver sedan
deliberately chase her down.

15
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:44,905
Uh, we're getting paint
off of the trash cans right now.

16
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,355
Hopefully we'll
get a make and model.

17
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,735
Uh, we've also got a partial plate.
Sounds like you're on top of it.

18
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,926
Sure, but I don't
mind getting your backup.

19
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:54,125
We're not backup. We're lead.

20
00:01:54,324 --> 00:01:55,490
Yes, ma'am.

21
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,575
A few days ago, rosemary
here filed a missing persons report

22
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,795
On her teenage son travis.
He had been gone for a week,

23
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,395
But he's run away from home twice,

24
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,045
And he's done a stint in juvie, so...
What was the juvie charge?

25
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,165
D.U.I. On a learner's permit.

26
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:10,025
Her house is eight blocks that way,

27
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,455
So we figured
that she was walking home

28
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,591
But from where, we're not sure.
She was with me.

29
00:02:15,637 --> 00:02:17,205
And who are you exactly?

30
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:21,340
My name is kristina frye.
I was rosemary's spiritual advisor

31
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,435
I'm sorry.
Did... did I hear that correctly?

32
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,755
Miss frye, you were with here where?
At my house.

33
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,640
We had finished a session.
We had contacted her husband.

34
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,925
Her dead husband?

35
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,960
Oh. He knew this
was gonna happen to her.

36
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,405
He warned her

37
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:39,390
That she was putting herself
in terrible danger. From whom?

38
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,795
I don't know. I'm merely a channel.

39
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,662
A-a channel for what?

40
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,690
For the energy of
the departed souls.

41
00:02:47,943 --> 00:02:48,642
Okay.

42
00:02:48,767 --> 00:02:51,775
Oh, so you knew
that this murder was gonna happen?

43
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,555
I didn't know. Her husband knew.

44
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,685
I just passed the warning
along to rosemary.

45
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,525
Okay. Got it.
Uh, by her own admission,

46
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,265
She's either, uh, a channel
for the energy of the departed souls

47
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,770
Or she's involved in this murder.

48
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,975
So you got a choice.
You can call ghostbusters

49
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,853
Or we can take this lady downtown.

50
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:11,055
Miss frye,
would you mind coming into our office

51
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,645
In the morning and answering
a few more questions in detail?

52
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,125
If I could be of any help,
I'd be glad to

53
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,260
Please call me kristina.

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,275
Where is all this
anger I feel coming from?

55
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,045
Not from me.
Maybe you're projecting.

56
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,735
No. Rosemary was my friend.

57
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,565
Am I sad? Of course. Am I angry?

58
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,680
Only that somebody would
do such a terrible thing to her.

59
00:03:33,882 --> 00:03:35,285
Don't take this the wrong way,

60
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:38,790
But you are completely
misreading the situation.

61
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,060
I am, am i?
Oh, this is gonna be good.

62
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,885
How long have you known rosemary
tennant? Almost three years.

63
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:59,775
Do you charge for your services?
Yes. How much depends on the resources

64
00:03:59,991 --> 00:04:01,235
Of the individual client,

65
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,825
But I never turn anyone away.
How much did you charge rosemary

66
00:04:03,995 --> 00:04:06,405
$500 per hour.
How many hours a week?

67
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:07,765
Five to six.

68
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:11,565
Oh, 3 grand a week. Nice.

69
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,720
Rosemary was a troubled soul.

70
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,379
She needed intensive help.

71
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,510
What was troubling her?

72
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,825
Her husband was a powerful
anchor in her life.

73
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:24,565
After his death,
I think she felt adrift, vulnerable.

74
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,345
And people that she
shouldn't have trusted

75
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:29,095
Recognized her weaknesses
and played on them. Oh, really?

76
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,810
Any people in particular?

77
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,920
Too many to mention.

78
00:04:33,045 --> 00:04:34,125
As a result,

79
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,535
I think her relationship
with her children may have suffered.

80
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,045
That would be clara and travis,
yes? Mm-hmm.

81
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,510
Suffered how?

82
00:04:41,691 --> 00:04:42,885
I'm sorry.

83
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,225
I'm not comfortable sharing
any more than that with you. Mm.

84
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:48,305
Travis went missing
several days ago.

85
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,465
What did she have
to say about that? Truly,

86
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,615
I'd love to help you,
but my practice is boun

87
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,935
By the same client
confidentiality codes

88
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,180
That all doctors abide by. You
have a professional therapist's license

89
00:04:58,424 --> 00:04:59,975
With the state? Yes, I do.

90
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,475
Your client's dead.
Her earthly vessel is dead.

91
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,565
When her soul completes its journey,
I could ask her

92
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,385
If it's all right to
share her problems with you

93
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,820
In more detail.

94
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,055
I recorded all of
our sessions on cd.

95
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,604
If she says yes,
I'll give them to you.

96
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,830
Why bother with that?
Why not just ask her who killed her?

97
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,820
Of course I will,
but she may not know.

98
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,340
Death doesn't grant omniscience.

99
00:05:22,824 --> 00:05:25,065
You're good. I like to think so.

100
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,895
Yes, you do. I think it's
important to love one's self.

101
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,345
How do you feel about yourself?
Oh. You tell me.

102
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,995
And forget about the $500 an hour.

103
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,495
I'm on civil service pay.

104
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,270
Okay, for free then.

105
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,615
I think you act
assured and arrogant,

106
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,475
But inside you are troubled

107
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,815
With deep guilt and self-loathing.

108
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:49,514
A recent trauma
in your past perhaps?

109
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,010
But you're more than
a little unstable.

110
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,700
You have your work cut out for you.

111
00:05:55,846 --> 00:05:57,085
You are good.

112
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,965
Please. Not to boast,

113
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:01,530
But I am quite a well-known
horrible tragedy.

114
00:06:02,376 --> 00:06:04,145
A mere half-hour on the internet

115
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,989
Would tell you
that I'm consumed with guilt and

116
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:08,840
Self-loathing.
One look in your eyes would tell me that

117
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,585
And what makes you think
I would spend any time

118
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,930
Researching you on the internet?

119
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,830
A little self-involved maybe?

120
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,885
May I go?

121
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,795
Yes. Thank you for your time.

122
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,131
Feel free to call me any time.
We will.

123
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,930
What?

124
00:06:37,177 --> 00:06:38,230
Do we know who's home?

125
00:06:38,418 --> 00:06:39,055
Until two days ago,

126
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,060
The residents were travis tennant,
rosemary tennant

127
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,455
And a semipermanent houseguest,
name of jeremy hale,

128
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:48,975
Portrait photographer and mrs.
Tennant's boyfriend,

129
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,060
According to the
gardener and pool guy.

130
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,110
Dooley. Dooley, come here.

131
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,415
Can I help you? Mr. Hale?

132
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,710
Yes. California
bureau investigation.

133
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:04,100
You mind if we come in?
No, not at all.

134
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,845
Uh, sorry about all this.

135
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,915
Looks like you weren't
alone last night.

136
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,885
Well, I was at a,
uh, gallery opening,

137
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,690
But someone's always here.

138
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,521
Rosie liked to have people around,

139
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:22,275
And, well,
you know us creative types...

140
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,610
Any chance to, uh, put off work.

141
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,535
How long have you lived here?

142
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:31,410
Uh... Going on six months.

143
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,765
I'm a, uh, a photographer,

144
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,580
And I met rosemary at a show.

145
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,435
I came to do a portrait,

146
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,339
And then I guess we just kinda gelled,
and I never left.

147
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:45,390
So you and mrs. Tennant were lovers?

148
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,610
That's what everyone says.

149
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:51,053
Did I love her and vice versa, yes.
But lovers?

150
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,900
We were close.
She understood me better than anyone.

151
00:07:55,025 --> 00:07:55,855
Living here,

152
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,270
You must have gotten
to know her kids pretty well.

153
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:01,290
Clara's all grown up.
Didn't come around much anymore.

154
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,578
And travis...
that kid has some problems.

155
00:08:03,828 --> 00:08:04,609
How so?

156
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:08,315
I think after his dad died,
he just lost it...

157
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,205
On drugs, stealing stuff,
acting out in crazy ways.

158
00:08:12,494 --> 00:08:14,185
When was the last time you saw him?

159
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:17,375
Over a week ago.
Rosie found drugs in his bedroom

160
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,535
They had a big fight.
He split. I don't know where.

161
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,495
He's got a hundred crazy
friends to hide out with.

162
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,785
Excuse me.
Uh, do you mind if I take a look around

163
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,725
No. Go for it.

164
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:26,930
Thank you.

165
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,035
Rosemary put you in her will
a few months back, didn't she?

166
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,025
Yeah, and I felt bad about that,
actually. It's too much.

167
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,935
But rosemary was
such a generous person,

168
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:39,665
And to refuse her generosity
would be to, you know,

169
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,895
Deny her essence.
The day before she died,

170
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,685
She made an appointment
with her estate lawyer,

171
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:46,569
Told him she wanted to make
further alterations to the trust.

172
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,979
Really? I had no idea.

173
00:08:49,104 --> 00:08:50,236
What do you think that was about?

174
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:52,685
I could only imagine
it has to do with travis

175
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:55,185
Cut him off,
and maybe it would straighten him out.

176
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,770
Lisbon!

177
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:04,290
Oh, you found my studio.

178
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,963
She was quite beautiful, wasn't she?

179
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,798
You really captured
so much in her eyes.

180
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,855
It's like she's talking to us.
Rosemary was an easy subject,

181
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:15,700
And those photos still don't
do her justice. This is quite a setup.

182
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,525
Mm. Darkroom,
state-of-the-art equipment.

183
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:21,227
It's nice to have a benefactor.
I'm blessed.

184
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,800
Or clever.

185
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,365
You say that travis left
because he and his mom had a fight.

186
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,815
Are you sure about this?
Well, of course. I was there.

187
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,155
I think mrs.
Tennant turned a blind eye

188
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,864
Towards her son's problems
because he lost his dad.

189
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,625
He didn't leave because of her.
He left because of you.

190
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,590
What are you talking about?
I think this was travis' room.

191
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,720
There's old poster
tape here on the walls

192
00:09:44,002 --> 00:09:46,610
There's stickers behind this door

193
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,753
And... Dents...

194
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,925
Up here, from where a
lacrosse ball was hitting it.

195
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,552
Travis plays lacrosse, doesn't he?

196
00:09:54,721 --> 00:09:56,585
He used to before he got into drugs.

197
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:59,275
And here... this pane
of glass has a crack in it

198
00:09:59,476 --> 00:10:02,130
Right at elbow or fist height.

199
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,603
Must have been quite
the argument between you two.

200
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,005
Okay, that's enough.
The only question is,

201
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,085
Did you take his
room as soon as he lef

202
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,465
Or did he leave because
you took his room?

203
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:14,820
You're in my personal space.
Please step back.

204
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,241
Excuse me.

205
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,130
So you kick him out of here,
he has to find someplace safe,

206
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,605
Someplace to hide where
change can't find him.

207
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,030
So where'd he go?

208
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,064
Yeah, it's here on the right.

209
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,055
He was happy in a smaller room.

210
00:10:51,277 --> 00:10:53,105
Yeah, I bet. Excuse me,

211
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,095
But there's a definite
note of uncalled for hostility

212
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,613
In your voice.
What... what is that about?

213
00:10:56,783 --> 00:10:58,570
He's just trying to do his job.

214
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:02,285
I know travis tennant
is suspect number one,

215
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:05,630
But jeremy isn't exactly
grieving right now.

216
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,145
I'll do some digging on hale,
see what I come up with.

217
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,765
Who's to say the kid's not dead?

218
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:13,380
Maybe he killed both of them.
More money in the will for him.

219
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,575
Anything on the business side?
Well, the psychic was right.

220
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,105
Every high-end con artist
and social parasite in town

221
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,985
Was hitting rosemary
up for a million.

222
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:21,847
These guys are all white-collar

223
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:25,101
Leeches, not murderers.
This looks like her.

224
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,500
The daughter.

225
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,495
Miss tennant, I'm agent lisbon.
Thank you for coming.

226
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,250
I came as soon as I could.

227
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,265
Has anyone found my brother?

228
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,120
Please have a seat.

229
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,116
We're so sorry for your loss.

230
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:43,840
To answer your question, no.
Travis is still missing.

231
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,870
But we're doing everything
we can to find him.

232
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,150
Can you tell us about your mother?

233
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,910
Anything might help.

234
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,430
I just can't believe she's gone.

235
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:59,000
I mean, she was such a good person.

236
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,630
Everybody loved her, and...

237
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:05,290
For her to die in the
gutter like that, it's...

238
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,115
Like garbage, it's... it's horrible.

239
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,080
People say she changed
after your father died.

240
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:13,700
She...

241
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,200
She sort of lost control.

242
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,330
And my father was...

243
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,930
The one that kept it all going.

244
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,050
And she just...

245
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,965
She wasn't that person.

246
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:27,660
Could you give us an example?

247
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,300
When I was in college...

248
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:34,905
My brother called to tell me

249
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:38,225
That people were ripping us off.

250
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:42,125
And mom would invest in
one bad scheme after another,

251
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,130
And I tried to warn her,
but she just wouldn't listen.

252
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:48,370
I'm sure she thought
she was doing the right thing.

253
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,020
Is that when your brother
started acting out?

254
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,690
He missed dad a lot,

255
00:12:55,652 --> 00:12:57,520
And suddenly...

256
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,370
He was the man of the house,

257
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,090
And I think he just
wasn't used to it.

258
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,730
That's when jeremy moved in,

259
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:12,165
And he's scary. He's very dangerous.

260
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:13,610
Dangerous how?

261
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,030
He wants what he wants,
and he has a very bad temper.

262
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,540
I was worried for my mom.

263
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,375
Clara, where do you think travis is?

264
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,040
If I knew, I would be with him.

265
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:29,855
I mean, he's my brother.

266
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:33,380
He's... He's all I've got left.

267
00:13:35,191 --> 00:13:37,585
Could you put his
number in there, please?

268
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:40,850
Well, he's not gonna call you back.
Eh, just put it in.

269
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:46,325
Thank you.

270
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,215
Hello, travis.

271
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,875
You don't know me,
but my name is patrick jane.

272
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,045
I'm a friend. I know you're
in a little trouble right now,

273
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:04,365
And I want to offer
you some peace of mind.

274
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:07,080
But I don't know what
peace of mind means to you.

275
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,325
It's different for everyone.

276
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,455
For instance, I like riding horses.

277
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,135
But would horses make you happy?
I don't know.

278
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,265
Why wouldn't horses make you happy?

279
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:19,045
Go round and round in
your mind until you're sure,

280
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:22,210
And go to that place
where you know you are happy.

281
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:25,180
Then give me a call.
You have my number.

282
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,930
What was that about?

283
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,110
Quick. What images
came into your head?

284
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,785
All I'm saying,
you can't say there's

285
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,751
No such thing as psychics just 'cause
you've never met one. You're right.

286
00:14:36,938 --> 00:14:37,565
I've never seen a zebra.

287
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:40,045
Doesn't mean they don't exist.
You've never seen a zebra

288
00:14:40,215 --> 00:14:42,000
No. You've never been to a zoo?

289
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,165
You know, I don't get zoos.

290
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:45,190
You pay money to
look at animals. Why?

291
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,440
Guys.

292
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:50,950
That's him.

293
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,010
Jane, I'll never doubt you again.

294
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,580
You ever doubted me?

295
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,390
Travis, wait.

296
00:15:33,538 --> 00:15:34,516
Just wait.

297
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,415
Travis.

298
00:15:43,736 --> 00:15:45,335
We know why you took off.

299
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,488
We know about your
fight with jeremy.

300
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,015
Why didn't you call somebody?
Why just run?

301
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,370
'cause there wasn't
anything they could do.

302
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,925
I didn't want to
cause any more trouble.

303
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,875
Cause any trouble for who?
They're your fami.

304
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,320
You really don't understand.

305
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,670
Look, I loved my mom... So much.

306
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,125
But after the blowout with jeremy,

307
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:11,080
I couldn't go back there.
There was no way.

308
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,655
When can I see him?

309
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,070
Oh, soon.

310
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,750
So where'd you go?
Friends' houses mostly.

311
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,729
We'll need names and addresses.

312
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,645
You know,
maybe if I'd been home that night,

313
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:26,865
She'd still be alive.

314
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,965
I... Maybe...

315
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,531
Here's the truth, travis.

316
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,185
After your dad died,
your mom gave away a lot of your money.

317
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,735
Then she moved jeremy into the house

318
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,355
And made your life miserable.

319
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,041
So even though you took off,
you knew where she'd be that night

320
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,905
You knew how she'd walk home.

321
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,730
Are you saying I did that?

322
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:50,400
When my dad died, mom was all I had.

323
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,360
You don't think I wanted
to be there for her?

324
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,995
That dirtbag jeremy moves in,
he starts telling me what to do

325
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,760
And bossing me around.

326
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,070
She was my mom. I didn't kill her.

327
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,900
I believe him.

328
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,100
Come here.

329
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,340
We'll be all right.

330
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,370
We'll be fine.

331
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:34,305
Travis is hurting.
Or he's lying. Let's not forget,

332
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:37,013
Jeremy hale stood to
inherit a few million himself.

333
00:17:37,183 --> 00:17:39,307
So maybe he wanted
to speed up the process...

334
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:42,728
Finance a nice long photo
shoot in south america,

335
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,565
Lay low for awhile?
I heard from rosemary's probate lawyer.

336
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,944
Guess who she just added to her will.
Uh, kristina frye?

337
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:53,285
Ink wasn't even dry yet.
Kristina told us she knew in advance

338
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,875
That rosemary was in danger.

339
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,635
Why would she tell
us that if she's guilty?

340
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,365
How diabolically clever of
her... make us dismiss her as a suspect

341
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,425
Because she made
herself look like one.

342
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:07,005
Or maybe, just maybe,
she has a rare and precious gift

343
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:08,495
And is trying to help us.

344
00:18:08,673 --> 00:18:10,580
A rare and precious gift.

345
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:14,930
Tell me...
Who gets these gifts anyhow?

346
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,715
And how come no
one ever has the gift

347
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,265
For seeing horse race results?

348
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,955
And how come dead people
always talk such tedious drivel?

349
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,352
Play nice.
Van pelt's entitled to her opinion.

350
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,825
Not if it's wrong.
This is like believing in

351
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:27,480
The easter bunny.
Who says there's no easter bunny

352
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:32,845
Van pelt. Oh, hi.

353
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:35,310
Wow. Thanks.

354
00:18:35,574 --> 00:18:37,730
Got it. We'll be right over.

355
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:41,169
That was kristina.
She said she's picking up on something.

356
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,914
Something that might help us.

357
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,400
Why don't you go talk to her?
I'm coming.

358
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:50,463
Does he have to?
If she's conning us, we need to know.

359
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:54,440
She isn't. I can tell. Behave.

360
00:18:57,798 --> 00:18:58,745
Miss frye?

361
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:01,065
Be right there. Take a seat, please.

362
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,910
Madame zoltar welcomes you.

363
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,630
Mm. I smell dead people.

364
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,250
Jane, shh.

365
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:30,445
Look, you can do all your
holiday shopping right here.

366
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:31,575
Aren't you the least bit interested

367
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,425
In what she has to say? No.

368
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:36,755
I love the mirror, though.
Conveniently located, isn't it

369
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,395
What do you mean? It's 1-way
glass... textbook clairvoyant trick.

370
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,870
She studies her client's
body language before they come in.

371
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:53,045
Come on. She's probably
watching us right now.

372
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:55,610
You can't go in there. Sure, I can.

373
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,330
Jane.

374
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,875
See? No one-way glass.
Oh, maybe in this instance,

375
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,705
But not as a general observation.

376
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,122
Shall we sit down?

377
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,120
Sure.

378
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,355
You know what I'm struggling with?

379
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,770
Enlighten me.

380
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,325
You talk such a
good high-class game,

381
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,715
But your temple

382
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,130
Looks like a discount
souvenir store in shangri-la.

383
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,925
Well, certain imagery
goes with the territory.

384
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:30,310
You know that.

385
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:32,845
People expect a little razzmatazz,

386
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:35,540
Like the shiny suits
you used to wear.

387
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,270
He says...

388
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,940
"i'm sorry for all the pain
I caused you and your mother."

389
00:20:42,326 --> 00:20:43,820
They're tears of joy.

390
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,815
So you have done some research on me.
I have now.

391
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:50,210
Red john murdered your family.
I'm very sorry for your loss.

392
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:54,665
Is that why you gave up your calling?
Calling? Is that what this is?

393
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,885
Yeah, calling, gift, as you like.

394
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:57,865
There's no doubt that you had that.

395
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:01,180
Why'd you give it up?
It was the suits. Chafing. Horrible

396
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:04,639
Always dancing.
Why is that? Don't try to cold read me.

397
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,725
Oh, I wouldn't know how.
We both know that's a lie.

398
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,600
Can we, um, talk about the case?

399
00:21:11,928 --> 00:21:12,495
Yes.

400
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,750
Please.

401
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,983
So has rosemary contacted you yet?

402
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:18,813
No, not yet.

403
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,985
It often takes some time
for souls to make a full transit.

404
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,600
Yes, the celestial
bus is running late.

405
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,985
I called to offer you my assistance.

406
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,195
Clearly you're not interested.

407
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,370
Wait. I'm the agent here.

408
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,200
We are interested.

409
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:38,110
I had a vision about
the car used to kill rosemary.

410
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:44,105
Water rushing into the windows,
tires underwater,

411
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,346
Resting on concrete.

412
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:48,435
Concrete? Like a swimming pool?

413
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,340
Um, bigger.

414
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,565
A reservoir maybe.

415
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:54,820
There's founders lake
just outside of town.

416
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,970
Yes, a reservoir.

417
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,450
Thanks.

418
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,095
The damage to the
front end is consistent

419
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,955
With a vehicle versus
pedestrian collision.

420
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,017
But get this-- the v.I.N. Number

421
00:22:32,186 --> 00:22:34,925
Matches rosemary tennant's
own registration. That's her car?

422
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:36,275
Yeah, two moving violations

423
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,265
Show that travis used
the vehicle all the time.

424
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,359
It could have been jeremy.
He had access to it as well

425
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,785
Uh, put one of them
in the car that night...

426
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:45,035
Traffic cameras,
witnesses at gas stations.

427
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,380
If it exists, I want to know.
I'm on it.

428
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,785
Are you guys gonna
arrest travis tennant

429
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:53,345
Or, uh, you want us to?
I'm sorry, detective,

430
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:55,565
But everything we have
right now is circumstantial.

431
00:22:55,752 --> 00:22:58,205
Well, I go with my gut,
uh, 90% of the time.

432
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:02,530
If it feels right, it's meant to be.
What about the other 10%?

433
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:09,405
If anyone needs arresting,
it's kristina frye.

434
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,264
She knew that rosemary
was in danger.

435
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:14,595
She knew where to find the car,
the murder weapon,

436
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,625
Which means that she either
does have supernatural powers

437
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,315
Or she was involved in the crime.

438
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,855
Come on. She simply
did what you do so well.

439
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,275
With an air of confidence,
she made an educated guess.

440
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,225
Where else would you
dump a car around here?

441
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,750
She's a good guesser.

442
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:32,703
Well, I guess that's
a possibility, too.

443
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:35,905
Yes, and that's what you object to,
isn't it?

444
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:39,220
Not that she's a con artist
but that she's so good at it.

445
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:40,555
Maybe even better than you.

446
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,580
Not at all. I...

447
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:44,420
All right, yes.

448
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:48,040
Not better than me,
mind you, but she is good,

449
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:51,610
And it's the good ones
that are the most dangerous.

450
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:55,215
Excuse me,
but you might consider the possibility

451
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,205
That she's actually
honestly in touch

452
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:58,688
With something beyond
your understanding.

453
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:03,070
That would be golf and musical
theater of the'30s and'40s.

454
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:05,410
The car is empty except
for these in the trunk.

455
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,805
High-grade coated nylon.

456
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:10,460
Just like they use in a photo lab.

457
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,945
Jeremy's gone.

458
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:17,581
We had an exchange,
and I told him not to come back

459
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:21,105
And some of mom's jewelry is missing.
You really think he did it?

460
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:23,700
And someone stole your mom's
car and used it to kill her.

461
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,673
But the locks weren't jimmied.
They had a key.

462
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,775
And you think I did it.
Look, I already told you were I was.

463
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,825
Go out, talk to my friends. We did.
They said there were a lot of people

464
00:24:33,182 --> 00:24:34,889
At the party that night.
You could have left and come back.

465
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:36,800
This is so unfair. How...

466
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,635
My brother's right.
Jeremy just left.

467
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,665
Clearly he's hiding something.

468
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:42,920
Lisbon.

469
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,960
Stay here.

470
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,045
Rigsby, it's me.
I need an a.P.B. On jeremy hale.

471
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:52,955
Check the airports.

472
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,445
He's probably got
at least two hours on us.

473
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:56,880
He hasn't gone that far.
He's not on a plane.

474
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,070
How do you know?
He left too much behind.

475
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,145
In a room full of photographs,
five are of rosemary.

476
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,845
The rest are dated
at least a year ago.

477
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,300
Except...

478
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,690
This one.

479
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,055
This was taken a few weeks ago.
Brand-new.

480
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,190
A little damaged,
but somewhat intimate.

481
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:23,021
A woman's heel would make
a hole like that, wouldn't it? Yes.

482
00:25:23,468 --> 00:25:24,365
Being rosemary's house,

483
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:28,135
We can assume it's rosemary's heel.
I'm still with you

484
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,025
Why would rosemary
want to put her heel

485
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,825
In this nice young woman's picture,

486
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:35,190
That was taken by her
womanizing boyfriend jeremy?

487
00:25:43,818 --> 00:25:44,460
Know her?

488
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,639
Yeah. That's, um, connie adams,

489
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,670
My mom's bridge partner's
daughter, connie.

490
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,500
Connie?

491
00:26:18,648 --> 00:26:19,625
Can I help you?

492
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:22,540
Nice necklace. Police.

493
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:25,840
We're looking for jeremy hale.
Is he here?

494
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:27,260
Baby?

495
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,545
Hi, jeremy.

496
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:31,635
Hey.

497
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,968
Let's go talk.
You might want some clothes.

498
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:37,370
Or a lot more whipped cream.
Your call.

499
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:46,120
Rosemary was killed by somebody
driving one of her own cars.

500
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,480
Okay.

501
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,225
A silver chrysler.
You ever drive this car, jeremy?

502
00:26:54,449 --> 00:26:57,480
No. That's the car
that travis drove.

503
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:02,195
Not my style.
Thing is, we found a glove in the car

504
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,415
That's from your photo lab.

505
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,455
What are the chances
we find your d.N.A. On it?

506
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,965
Well, travis could have taken those.
Travis has an alibi.

507
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:10,205
You could have taken the car
in order to throw suspicion on him.

508
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:14,835
I could have, I suppose, but I didn't.
You left the tennant house fast,

509
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,785
Almost like you were running away.

510
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:19,525
Why is that?
I got into it with the kids.

511
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:22,141
That clara is insane.
I thought she was gonna assault me.

512
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,559
They think you killed their mother.

513
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,910
Well, they don't
know anything about me

514
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:29,695
I loved her.
Of course you did. That's why you gave

515
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,265
Rosemary's necklace
to your hot new girlfriend.

516
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:34,070
Well, it's no good
to rosemary, is it?

517
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,155
So shoot me. I'm a pragmatist.

518
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,080
That's a good word.

519
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:42,395
Miami, new york, chicago...

520
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,414
All widows, and all contributors
to your budding career.

521
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,585
And all alive and well
and still good friends of mine,

522
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:49,043
If you care to speak to any of them.

523
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:52,675
Well, phoebe might be
a little ambivalent about me,

524
00:27:52,966 --> 00:27:56,220
But... The others are, you know...

525
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,675
Do you know kristina frye?

526
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,525
Uh... That name is familiar, but no.

527
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:05,700
I don't think so.
She's rosemary's psychic,

528
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,745
And I think you have met kristina.

529
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:10,005
You took her photograph.
Jane tells us one of your portraits

530
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:13,300
Is hanging in her foyer.
Well, i-i take a lot of pictures.

531
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:16,425
Two beneficiaries on the same will,

532
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:18,265
Both intimate friends of rosemary's,

533
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:20,745
Yet the two of you
have never actually met.

534
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:22,440
What are the chances?

535
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,380
I want a lawyer.

536
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,500
Hey, boss, check this out.

537
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:41,120
Info on kristina frye.

538
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,925
In the last ten years,
each of these people

539
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:44,475
Left her name in their wills,

540
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,905
Paydays ranging from
$10,000 to $200,000.

541
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:50,570
Maybe the psychic and jeremy
had a business relationship

542
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,023
Fleecing vulnerable women.
So maybe jane was right.

543
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,750
It doesn't prove anything.

544
00:28:55,195 --> 00:28:58,170
No, but it's a good place
to start a conversation with frye.

545
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:04,120
Kristina,
how well do you know jeremy hale?

546
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:08,935
He was rosemary's lover.
Uh, kind of a user, I'd say,

547
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,583
But genuinely fond of her, I think.

548
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,300
Quite a good photographer.
He took my picture.

549
00:29:13,546 --> 00:29:14,785
Did you know he
was also named in the

550
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:17,605
Victim's will?
If that was rosemary's decision, fine

551
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:20,565
But what are you getting at? Over
the last decade, five different people

552
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:24,580
Have named you in their wills.
Against my express wishes.

553
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,735
I've helped hundreds of sick clients

554
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,575
Confront their fear of dying,

555
00:29:29,937 --> 00:29:31,715
And I assure all of them
that I will try and speak

556
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,555
To them after they're gone,
but I have never asked

557
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,825
Any of them for anything ever.

558
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:38,535
Then why did jeremy get nervous
when your name was mentioned

559
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:41,830
Probably because we had
sex on a couple of occasions.

560
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,533
We had fun. He's a good time.

561
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,575
Have you spoken to rosemary yet?
Yes, I have.

562
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:55,325
Oh, you did? What did she say?
She seems quite taken with you.

563
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:57,715
Ah. She said you were a good man...

564
00:29:58,577 --> 00:30:02,845
A deeply misguided and damaged man,

565
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:04,305
But good.

566
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:05,635
Well, that's very flattering.

567
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,505
Did she happen to mention
who killed her? No. She didn't know.

568
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:12,603
But she wants me to keep
trying to help you as much as I can.

569
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,535
Well, not that you mention it,
I'd love to hear

570
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:18,110
Your cd recordings of your
sessions together. Absolutely.

571
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,555
And, uh,
can you have rosemary appear

572
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,815
At the reading of the will? She's
a departed soul, not a wedding singer.

573
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,655
You can't book her in advance. Ah,

574
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,485
Yeah. I guess,
uh, time doesn't mean muc

575
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:29,715
When you're dead forever.
No schedule to keep.

576
00:30:29,956 --> 00:30:32,120
What's the rush? Right.

577
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:48,845
Nice cradling.

578
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:49,965
You play lacrosse?

579
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:51,090
No.

580
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,185
Fast-moving sticks scare me.

581
00:30:53,788 --> 00:30:54,686
Find out who did it yet?

582
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:55,940
Not yet.

583
00:31:00,694 --> 00:31:01,694
Find anything?

584
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,685
I think kristina frye is responsible

585
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:07,180
For your mother's death.

586
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:10,345
I need you to ask
her to conduct a sance

587
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:12,465
To contact your mom
at the reading of the will.

588
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:14,290
I don't understand.

589
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:16,505
How is getting in touch with my mom

590
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:18,435
Gonna help you catch kristina?
Well, obviously,

591
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,505
She's not really gonna
get in touch with your mom.

592
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:23,250
She's a fraud.
I'm going to expose her.

593
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,134
How do you know she
won't really pull it off

594
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:27,400
Well, she won't, because she can't.

595
00:31:33,398 --> 00:31:34,215
I don't like it.

596
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:37,270
Me neither.
What's the alternative? It's immoral.

597
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,555
I don't know about that.

598
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,880
Say your brain gets
cooked if you use 'em a lot.

599
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:42,880
Make you infertile, too.

600
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,900
What are you talking about?

601
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,616
Microwaves. What are you talking about?
The sance this evening.

602
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,185
We were looking at the microwave.

603
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,993
The sance has nothing
to do with anything.

604
00:31:52,163 --> 00:31:54,995
It's wrong to play with
that stuff... raising the dead

605
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,005
Uh, we're not actually
going to be doing that...

606
00:31:57,130 --> 00:32:01,545
Raising dead people.
You say that, but you don't know.

607
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:04,325
You're mocking the occult.

608
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:06,505
You don't have any
belief in the afterlife.

609
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,195
You don't know what
you're getting into.

610
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,705
Well, I know that sances
are tools that con artists

611
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:14,990
Like kristina use to
manipulate people. Boo!

612
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:23,729
Yeah, laugh.
Go ahead. It's really important to you

613
00:32:23,902 --> 00:32:25,295
That kristina's a fake, isn't it?

614
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:28,585
Because if she's not...
if she does have a gift...

615
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:31,284
Everything you mock,
everything you discredit,

616
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,235
Everything you stand
for gets turned upside down.

617
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,135
Um... Yeah. True.

618
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,170
Unlikely, but true.

619
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,985
And what if your family's
looking down at you tonight

620
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:43,375
From the sance,
trying to talk to you,

621
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,030
But they can't because
you won't believe?

622
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,410
Well, that would be very sad.

623
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,465
I'm sorry.

624
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,920
No, that's OK.

625
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:17,850
Really, it's quite irregular.

626
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,630
It's what my mother wanted.

627
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,780
Very w well.

628
00:33:22,378 --> 00:33:24,380
If you can all please sit down?

629
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,425
At the request of rosemary

630
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,920
And hedaughter clara,

631
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:35,970
The reading of the will
shall be prefaced with a...

632
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:37,890
What do you call it?

633
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:41,670
A contact ritual... sance,
some call it.

634
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,564
A sance.

635
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:46,940
Good evening,
everybody, and welcome.

636
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:52,364
With your help tonight,
I'm gonna try and contact rosemary.

637
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:55,345
Will you all please hold hands

638
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:57,755
With your neighbor on either side?

639
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,570
Everybody?

640
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:03,390
Good. Thank you.

641
00:34:04,295 --> 00:34:07,610
Thank you.
Would you please turn the lights down?

642
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,910
The veil will be drawn back
and rosemary will come to us,

643
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,682
As long as we believe.

644
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:22,040
As long as we believe.

645
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,455
Everybody concentrate

646
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:30,010
On the candle in
the center of the table.

647
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:32,905
Look at it

648
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:36,520
And concentrate on rosemary.

649
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:38,744
Come to us, rosemary.

650
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,070
Come to us.

651
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,780
Speak.

652
00:34:54,094 --> 00:34:57,865
Kristina. Kristina.

653
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:59,724
It's me, rosemary.

654
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,590
I'm here,
as I promised you I would be.

655
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:08,180
All your friends and family are here,
too, rosemary.

656
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,870
Is there anything
that you'd like to say?

657
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:14,404
Or ask?

658
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,060
Rosemary?

659
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,310
Clara?

660
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:24,260
Clara?

661
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,290
Mom?

662
00:35:30,173 --> 00:35:31,672
Why, clara?

663
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,020
Why did you do it?

664
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,640
I know what you're doing,
and it's not gonna work.

665
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,345
What do you mean?

666
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,385
This is all a scheme

667
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:07,830
That you and kristina cooked up,
isn't it?

668
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,940
Well, it's very effective,
but I'm not buying it.

669
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:14,250
I'm not gonna buy it.
I'm not buying it. I can't.

670
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,640
I can't.

671
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:17,860
No.

672
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,090
No, i...

673
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,660
It's... I'm...

674
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:28,105
Next cue's up. This isn't happening.

675
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,360
Got it.

676
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:37,295
Why, clara, why?

677
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,920
Who's doing this?

678
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,750
I'm sorry, mom.

679
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:49,430
I'm so sorry.

680
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:51,680
Was it you, clara?

681
00:36:52,756 --> 00:36:54,340
Were you in the car?

682
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,133
Is that why she's here?

683
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:00,540
Is that what's caused all this?

684
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:11,730
Yes.

685
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:18,830
Yes.

686
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,620
I got mad.

687
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,100
I just got mad.

688
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:28,247
Why?

689
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,360
She told me...

690
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,461
That she was gonna
change the will again

691
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:37,270
To disinherit travis.

692
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:41,360
She said that it
was for his own good.

693
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,250
And she wouldn't listen to me.

694
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,740
We said some harsh
things to each other.

695
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:53,345
So I rode the train
down from clear lake

696
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:55,790
To speak to her in person,

697
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,800
Make her...

698
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:00,820
See things rationally.

699
00:38:01,698 --> 00:38:06,170
I knew she was going
to see her damn psychic.

700
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,740
And...

701
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:10,155
I didn't want to run
into that creep jeremy,

702
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,960
So I went to the house

703
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,970
To go pick up one
of the cars to meet her.

704
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:20,966
I saw her after she left kristina's,

705
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,190
And I called her

706
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:26,005
So that she wouldn't be freaked out

707
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:28,450
That I would turn up
in the middle of the night,

708
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:31,910
And she didn't pick up the phone

709
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:34,355
For her own daughter, and...

710
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,191
I just got mad.

711
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:54,290
Thank you for your honesty, clara.

712
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,295
How did you know that it was me?

713
00:38:57,505 --> 00:38:59,170
Uh, well, uh...

714
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,905
It didn't occur to me until later

715
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:04,850
When you started trying
to pin the blame on jeremy.

716
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:07,985
But when you first came in here,
you expressed great horror

717
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:09,595
That your mother
had died in the gutter...

718
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,595
Not in the road,
not in the sidewalk, but the gutter.

719
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,240
For her to die in the
gutter like that, it's...

720
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:19,425
Like garbage, it's... it's horrible.

721
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:21,415
And how could you have
known that she died in the gutter

722
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:24,420
Unless... You'd been there?

723
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:30,575
I did it for travis.

724
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,162
And for yourself.

725
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:35,960
She said that she would protect us!

726
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:43,300
She promised my dad that she would.

727
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:49,240
Parents are supposed
to protect their kids.

728
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,860
Yes, they are.

729
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,729
Can I see my brother now?

730
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,240
Sure.

731
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,710
I know you weren't thinking right...

732
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:10,900
When you did what you did.

733
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,703
Be good to aunt jo,

734
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:16,925
And don't... don't leave
your clothes everywhere,

735
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:20,170
And... Be respectful, okay?

736
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:22,510
I will.

737
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:27,790
I love you.

738
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:33,480
I love you, too.

739
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,035
Thank you for letting
me talk to her.

740
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:47,239
You bet.

741
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,200
You sleep here?

742
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,140
Yes, sometimes.

743
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,304
Uh, the noise relaxes me, you know.

744
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,250
It's like the sea.

745
00:41:17,638 --> 00:41:18,435
Can I help you?

746
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:21,870
Yeah, I just came to pick
up my recordings. Help yourself.

747
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:24,000
Thanks.

748
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:27,805
I need to talk to you.

749
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:31,070
Fire away. In private.

750
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:32,805
This is private.

751
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:34,240
More private.

752
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,530
Okay.

753
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:52,380
So...

754
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,035
Promise me you won't interrupt.
Hear me out.

755
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,120
Okay, I promise.

756
00:41:58,270 --> 00:41:59,875
I talked to your wife.
Oh, hang on, this is...

757
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,220
No, nuh-uh.

758
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:07,465
Ever since your wife
and daughter were killed,

759
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:09,225
There's a question
about that night's events

760
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:11,420
That's been tormenting you, yes?

761
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:14,788
- Yes?
- Yes

762
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:19,705
Your wife wants me to tell you

763
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:21,670
That your daughter never woke up.

764
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:24,350
She didn't know what happened.

765
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:27,830
She wasn't scared,
not even for a second.

766
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:34,250
You're done channeling? That's it?

767
00:42:34,948 --> 00:42:35,785
That's it.

768
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:37,050
Thanks.

769
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,760
Good bye, Mr. Jane.
