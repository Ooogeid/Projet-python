00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,470
What do we got?

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,260
Jim gulbrand, c.e.o.and founder of
the software company gaia matrix,

7
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:32,270
Was reported missing by his
live-in brother yesterday.

8
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:36,290
Local p.d.responded to the call, but they
didn't check the boat until this morning.

9
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,390
They found blood on the
deck, but no sign of a body.

10
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,700
Why is it ours?

11
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,880
The marina is privately owned,
on lease by the city of sausalito.

12
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,590
It was local p.d.'s decision
whether or not to take the case.

13
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,780
Mm, a high-profile
missing persons case.

14
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,210
I wonder why they wouldn't take that.

15
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:00,700
- You coming?
- He's not feeling well. Stomach.

16
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:01,980
I'm fine.

17
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:05,610
You get me sick, i'm gonna put
you on stakeout for a month.

18
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,770
Yes, boss.

19
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,250
- This is it?
- Yeah.

20
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,970
No sign of struggle, no weapon?

21
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,030
Nothing.

22
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,790
What else do we know about the victim?

23
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,840
Jim gulbrand is 33 years old.

24
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:31,890
He lives here in sausalito, has an
estimated net worth of $100 million.

25
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,610
He's rich. Very rich.

26
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:37,300
He's also recently divorced
from one kathryn stubbs-gulbrand.

27
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,130
Does the victim have a criminal record?

28
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:43,190
No.The company he founded, gaia matrix,

29
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,490
was under investigation by the
s.e.c.for securities violations.

30
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,960
*******

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,690
He was facing heavy fines
and federal prison time.

32
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,270
Do you need my help with... Never mind.

33
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,620
Maybe it's all just an elaborate hoax.

34
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,560
That would explain why there's no body.

35
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,280
You take a boat out, you go missing, everybody
assumes you're at the bottom of the ocean.

36
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,970
Your body and yr killer
are never to be found.

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,080
That'd make perfect sense.

38
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,670
- This one?No.
- Nope.

39
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,440
How about this one?

40
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,150
Ah, sorry.

41
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,000
What are you doing?

42
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,950
Well, there's no use in being anchored
when you're tied up at the dock.

43
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,640
After you.

48
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,680
When did you notice
your brother was missing?

49
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,970
Well, jim and i talkedxevery day.

50
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:14,130
I knew something was wrong
when he didn't come home.

51
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,700
So you live herepwith
your brother, keith?

52
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,280
Uh, for a few months, semi-temporarily.

53
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,750
Jim wanted company during his divorce.

54
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,650
After you, bro.

55
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,460
Tell us about your brother-- who he
associated he with, what drove him.

56
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,330
Well, jim's life was gaia matrix. Yeah.

57
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:36,620
That's the company he started
with rick. Green, um...

58
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,210
Platform... Software.
Don't ask me what that is.

59
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,490
Rick being rick bregman?

60
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,680
Rick and jim were best
friends from grade school,

61
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:51,130
and they built a whole empire
out of our parents' garage.

62
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,420
At the uh...

63
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,270
At the time i was totally
bummed, you know, 'cause i'm like,

64
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,060
"dude, where do i set
up my drum kit now?"

65
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:02,590
Well, little did i know.

66
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,290
What about his personal
life? Was he dating anyone?

67
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,580
Brooke harper--
cool woman...

68
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,190
For a psychiatrist.

69
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,400
- Oh, she's a psychiatrist.
- Yeah.

70
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:16,780
Uh, works at the sausalito rehab center.

71
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:21,570
I was in there for,
um, refresher course,

72
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,860
and that's how they first met,

73
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,480
when, um, jim came to visit.

74
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:28,230
Did your brother and brooke have any
arguments lately? Anything like that?

75
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,450
No. Jim's crazy about her.

76
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,690
He said, uh, she's the only
woman that could figure him out.

77
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:37,520
I think he was gonna propose to her.

78
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,560
Your brother was
recently divorced, right?

79
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,830
From a, uh, kathryn stubbs-gulbrand?

80
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,160
Best thing he ever did.

81
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,370
That woman was a... Nightmare.

82
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,850
How so?

83
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,580
She was just a giant greed head.

84
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:56,970
I mean, all she wanted was a bigger
house, bigger boat, more jewelry...

85
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,570
Do you, uh, play all these instruments?

86
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,620
Uh, keyboards and bass mostly.

87
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,690
Is it a sort of a new-age rock fusion?

88
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:10,080
Yeah. Kinda... Yeah.
You know, with an edge?

89
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,460
How did you know, man?

90
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,610
Ah, wild guess.

91
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:15,920
You make much money doing
this, playing the keyboards?

92
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:20,290
No. No. But i'm not in it for
the money. You know, music's a...

93
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,210
It's a spiritual thing.

94
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,970
Yeah, it is. So is money.

95
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:29,380
Everything that exists has a
spiritual essence or not at all.

96
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,540
So what happens to
all this? Who gets it?

97
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:37,370
A portion of the estate will go to
the charities that jim supported,

98
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:38,860
And the rest will go to me.

99
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:41,100
Ah, moti.

100
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:44,340
Chill, man.

101
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,340
Oh, i'm just playing.

102
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,420
Where were you friday night?

103
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,490
I...

104
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,540
Was in bed with a lady friend...

105
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:57,290
Gretchen somethin', um...

106
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:00,100
Number?

107
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,050
Thank you.

108
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,900
- What do you reckon?
- Possible.

109
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,740
- You?
- I don't know.

110
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:23,850
- Cho, write down this number.
- Got it.

111
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,380
Gretchen, no last name.

112
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,030
It's the brother's alibi
for last friday night.

113
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,110
Have van pelt check it out.

114
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:32,300
You and rigsby go and talk to
gulbrand's partner, rick bregman.

115
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:35,700
- He should be at gaia matrix.
- All right. Will do, boss.

116
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,390
Riby.

117
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,590
What?

118
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,770
Never mind.

119
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,640
<i>******</i>

120
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,430
I'm agent cho. This
is agent van pelt, cbi.

121
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,360
- I'm stuart hanson. I'll take you to rick.
- Right.

122
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:06,210
What's your job here, mr. Hanson?

123
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:09,000
Jim hates labels and pigeonholes.

124
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,400
I'm kind of the security chief, but
that sounds so fascistic, doesn't it?

125
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:18,510
What i am really is the firewalls and
encryptions and off-the-wall ideas guy.

126
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:25,180
Rick's been in the conference room all morning,
dealing with the fallout from jim's death.

127
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,590
He's pretty broken. We all are.

128
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,890
Jim meant so much to this
company, to all of us.

129
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,840
The company is co-owned by
you and jim, is that right?

130
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,010
Yes.

131
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,330
How did that relationship work, exactly?

132
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:48,170
Jim was the creative
brain behind gaia matrix.

133
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:50,130
He was the visionary.

134
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,400
I handled the business side.

135
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:56,980
We made a good team. You know,
he was a genius, but he wasn't...

136
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,470
Aggressive.

137
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:02,960
Me, i'm a jock... Competitive. I
like to win, make no apologies for it.

138
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,920
Is that what got you into
trouble with the s.e.c.?

139
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,520
Um, my lawyers warned me that this
line of questioning might come up,

140
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,640
And this is all i'm prepared to
say on that subject at the moment--

141
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:17,270
I am currently under investigation
by the s.e.c.for securities violations

142
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,590
due to my role here at gaia matrix.

143
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,330
That doesn't sound
like you said anything.

144
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,200
You understand why i
can't comment any further.

145
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:27,680
Did the investigation cause any
animosity between you and jim?

146
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,790
No. Not at all. We were like brothers.

147
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,190
Where were you the night of his murder?

148
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,980
Home... Alone. Look,
you're not getting this.

149
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:40,270
Jim was the creative
genius behind gaia matrix.

150
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,910
Without him, this company
is in grave jeopardy.

151
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,390
I had nothing to gain and
everything to lose by his death.

152
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:58,630
Dr. Harper, how long have
you been dating jim gulbrand?

153
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:03,500
It was just after i transferred here
from boston, so seven months ago now.

154
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:04,810
His...

155
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:09,730
An acquaintance of his was staying
here uh, we hit it off right away.

156
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,510
Could you think of anyone who, uh...

157
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,290
Excuse me-- might
want him dead?

158
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:16,670
I've thought about that
a lot this morning, and...

159
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,070
I can't think of anyone.

160
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:23,190
Jim was a kind, gentle,
generous, brilliant man.

161
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,760
I can't imagine anyone being capable
of doing something so awful to him.

162
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:30,040
Really? You're a psychiatrist,
and you can't imagine that?

163
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:35,030
To be more precise, i can't imagine a
rational reason for wishing him dead.

164
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:40,240
It's, uh, standard procedure to ask-- um,
where where you on the night of the murder?

165
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,320
I was here, finishing up some work.

166
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,900
If you'd like, i could have the admin nurse
send over the paperwork documenting my hours.

167
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,900
Yeah, that would be helpful. Thank you.

168
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:54,220
Do you have any... Leads
on the investigation so far?

169
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,820
Oh, i'm sorry. We don't
discuss our process, ma'am.

170
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:00,960
Uh, when exactly did you learn
of your boyfriend's murder?

171
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:04,150
If you want to know why i'm at work the
same day that my boyfriend is found dead,

172
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,740
Why don't you just ask me?

173
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:11,280
Okay. Uh, why are you at work the
same day your boyfriend is found dead?

174
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,940
I have patients who need me.

175
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:19,170
And if i had to sit at home and
actually think about jim being... Gone...

176
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,370
I'd lose it.

177
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,130
Being here, whether it...

178
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:29,530
Looks good to you or not, is
the only way i know how to cope.

179
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,610
Are you all right?

180
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:35,300
- Yeah, i'm okay. - Uh, no.
He's--he's been quite sick.

181
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:39,530
- Well, let me have a look at you.
- I'm fine.

182
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:42,160
Fever.

183
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,710
- Nausea? Coughing?
- Oh, yeah.

184
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,040
Flu.

185
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:48,880
Look, i'm not really supposed
to do this, but if you want,

186
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,750
I can write a prescription
for an antiviral.

187
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,820
Uh, sure.

188
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:59,180
Have this filled and...

189
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,680
You will feel better in no time.

190
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,060
Uh, sure. Thanks.

191
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,140
Thank you.

192
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,720
Any word from gulbrand's partner?

193
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,810
Not muchpin the way of motive, but he doesn't
have an alibi for the night of the murder.

194
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,860
Gulbrand's brother,pon the
other hand, checked out.

195
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:20,380
A gretchen moore says he was
with her the night of the murder.

196
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:21,960
Roommate backs up the story.

197
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,870
Are you still sick?
Man, go see a doctor.

198
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,380
I did. The dead guy's girlfriend
wrote me a prescription.

199
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:34,110
- So go fill it.
- Nah. By the time i take it, i'll be better.

200
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,040
What'd she give you anyway?

201
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:45,500
Oseltamivir phosphate.

202
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,240
May i see that?

203
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,510
Anything abouthis strike you as odd?

204
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:02,670
What's odd about it?
"oseltamivir phosphate."

205
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,900
Exactly. You can read it.

206
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:07,200
When was the last time you saw a
doctor's handwriting that you could read?

207
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,850
So she's precise. Is
that what you're implying?

208
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:14,560
Yes, and the possibility that
dr. Brooke harper is not a doctor.

209
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,650
Because she has penmanship skills?

210
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:20,110
And she doesn't have that cold,
creepy, doctor-y vibe they all have.

211
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:22,560
Well, be fair. Not all
doctors are cold and creepy.

212
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:26,200
First day of medical school, they get a
stack of books and a dead human being--that,

213
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:31,240
I'm afraid, will change you, brooke
harper was warm and emotional.

214
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,600
You like her, so she can't be a doctor.

215
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:36,300
Pretty much.

216
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,100
The a.m.a.and boston general both have
records of a doctor named brooke harper.

217
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,240
See?

218
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,220
But it says here that
she's 64 years old.

219
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,640
She looks pretty good.

220
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:51,120
Is there a word for
uncanny and irritating?

221
00:13:56,650 --> 00:14:00,650
Jeff, i'm going to be
leaving the clinic shortly,

222
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,870
So this is going to be
our last session together.

223
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:07,220
Oh, no, no, no. I-i-i
need you, dr. Harper.

224
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,450
How will i manage without you?

225
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,990
I'm sorry, jeff.I have
enjoyed our sessions together,

226
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,060
but i'm sure the clinic will provide
you with the best care possible.

227
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:19,290
should you ever need to
speak with me personally...

228
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,190
*******

229
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:26,500
I'm very sorry to interrupt, dr.
Harper, but the cbi are here again,

230
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,390
and they need to speak with you.

231
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,980
All right. Well, tell them i'll
be with them in ten minutes.

232
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:35,840
They said they needrto speak with you right
now, this moment, and they are most insistent.

233
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:38,540
Tell them i'll be right
out, maggie. Thank you.

234
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,080
I mean, i just...

235
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:45,260
I feel like i'm on the verge
of a real breakthrough. I...

236
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,850
I'm starting to open myself up
again to people in a real way.

237
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,960
My inner child is finally emerging.

238
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,540
D-- dr. Harper?
Dr. Harper?

239
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,740
*******

240
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:07,160
Damn. Let's go.

241
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:15,850
All i was able to find at
dr. Brooke harper's apartment.

242
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:18,500
Bank account emptied,
credit cards maxed out.

243
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:21,020
She must have been packed
and ready to leave days ago.

244
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:24,750
Her social security number and
medical license are fakes, too.

245
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,750
We have no idea who this woman is.

246
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:28,820
Well, we know that she's smart.

247
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,820
She posed as a doctor for seven
months, managed to elude you and rigsby.

248
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,660
No, she had a head start.
She didn't elude us.

249
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,620
All right, she eluded us.

250
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:40,380
Well, she's a professional conwoman.

251
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:45,550
I mean, she probably specializes in the seduction
of rich and successful, socially awkward men.

252
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,950
You think she's done this before?

253
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:48,510
Oh, yes, many times.

254
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,940
Why kill jim gulbrand?
What's her motive?

255
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,570
Maybe he found outvthe truth about her.

256
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,100
Then why not just vanish?

257
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,540
- Good morning.
- Morning.

258
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:59,120
I've been going through gulbrand's financial
records and found something interesting.

259
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:03,440
Last year, gulbrand made a series of
cash withdrawals from various accounts,

260
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:05,610
totaling $10 million.

261
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,100
What'd he spend the money on?

262
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:10,210
That's just it. He didn't deposit it,
and it doesn't look like he spent it.

263
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:14,710
So either he paid somebody
off or he hid the money--

264
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,190
A cash nest egg--either from
his ex-wife or the s.e.c.

265
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,830
Maybe that's what
brooke harper was after.

266
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:22,210
If only we knew who she
was or where she was.

267
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:27,330
Well, we know that she's ol,
she's fearless, she's systematic.

268
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,980
I mean, she went back to the clinic for an
extra day to try and hook another sucker.

269
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,390
She's a planner.

270
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,480
Could we get a copy of her
last credit card statement?

271
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,210
I can get it.

272
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,960
And they had the nerve to send me a
gold mercedes instead of a black one,

273
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,840
And so i sent it back.

274
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,610
Kathryn gulbrand?

275
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,410
Kathryn stubbs-gulbrand,
and you're interrupting.

276
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,450
'Am, we have a few questions
regarding your ex-husband's death.

277
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,220
Really? You wantrto talk to me now?

278
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:59,020
Or we can talk to you at
the station, if you prefer.

279
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:03,130
- Fine.
- Thank you. Thank you, ladies.

280
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:12,510
How long had you and jim
gulbrand been divorced?

281
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,650
14 months-- that's
when i moved out.

282
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,110
The divorce was final a year ago.

283
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:18,770
Were you angrypabout the divorce?

284
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,760
Of course i was angry. That's
usually why people get divorced.

285
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:25,260
Court documents indicate that you sued
your ex-husband on multiple occasions.

286
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,540
You bet your ass i did.

287
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:29,980
Jim tried to claim that the money that he
had in gaia matrix stock wasn't actually his,

288
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,690
But part of the company's capital.

289
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:34,190
I disagreed, and i won.

290
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:36,820
I got everything i wanted and more.

291
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:40,210
We have reason to believe that your
ex-husband may have hidden money from you

292
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:43,600
- during the divorce proceedings.
- What?

293
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,670
He made $10 million in
cash withdrawals last year.

294
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,260
You weren't aware of that?

295
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:52,400
That son of a bitch. I knew
it. I knew he was holding out.

296
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,440
That wasn't a damn
gym locker key, was it?

297
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,560
What key?

298
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,140
Last year he started wearing this
key around his neck, under his shirt.

299
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,390
I asked him what it was, and he
said that it was his gym locker key.

300
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,760
But i knew it wasn't. I knew it.

301
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:06,420
- How perceptive.
- What was that?

302
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,840
Oh, nothing, ma'am.

303
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,830
So you didn't know
anything about the money?

304
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:12,530
If i did, it wouldvbe mine right now.

305
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,870
- Where is it?
- We don't know.

306
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:18,370
Well, half that money's legally mine.

307
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,970
I don't want jim's loser brother
getting his loser hands on it.

308
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,110
I'm sure your probate
judge will take care of it.

309
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,450
Last friday, the, uh, night
of your ex-husband's murder,

310
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,870
where were you from
7:00 through 10:00 p.m.?

311
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,630
I was at a wine tasting in napa.

312
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,030
Could anyone confirm that for us?

313
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,420
Can you people charge mevwith any crime?

314
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:37,460
- Uh, no, but-- -
uh, no, you can't.

315
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:40,910
When you can, maybe then i'll tell
you the details of my personal life.

316
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:43,670
Until then, mind your own business.

317
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:51,630
I just got off the phone with our liaison
at the s.e.c.turns out jim gulbrand

318
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,780
Was cooperating with
their investigation.

319
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,560
Rick bregman never mentioned it.

320
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,700
Make sure you mention it to him.

321
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,510
What's this?

322
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:06,180
Brooke harper only used a credit card twice
in the last two week this is what she bought

323
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:11,220
In one day of shopping nine days ago,
and this is what she bought yesterday.

324
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,960
Now what do these things tell
us? That's a wig, by the way.

325
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:16,870
What's that on the, uh, bottom right?

326
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,190
Bandage.

327
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:19,960
It doesn't look like a bandage.

328
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:22,030
It's a bandage.

329
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:23,870
What do these things tell you?

330
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,810
Brooke harper wanted to pose as a man?

331
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,730
- Right.
- But why?

332
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,050
And what's that other stuff?

333
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,300
Well, that's--that's
the puzzle.

334
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,270
Is that kathryn stubbs?

335
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:36,360
She's... She's an unhappy person.

336
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:37,510
Where's rigsby?

337
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,470
He went to get his prescription filled.

338
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,960
I think that kathryn woman
actually made him worse.

339
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,560
She's hiding something, too.

340
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:45,880
She wouldn't say who she was
with the night of the murder.

341
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,130
- Keep an eye on her.
- Interesting.

342
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,180
She did tell us that gulbrand
wore a key around his neck,

343
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:53,980
that he said it was for his gym locker.

344
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:57,220
- Only there wasn't a key found on the body,as there?
- No.

345
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,520
She took his key.

346
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,360
That's why she dressed as a man, so
that she could get into his locker

347
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,730
in the men's changing room of the gym.

348
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:09,420
But if she had foundpjim's millions, then she
would have simply vanished right then and there.

349
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:10,710
Why stick around?

350
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,280
Because the money wasn't in the locker.

351
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,650
Exactly.

352
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,790
She's now trying to get
inside somewhere else.

353
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:35,500
- Thank you.
- Good afternoon. May i help you?

354
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,510
Yeah. I'm jim gulbrand.
I'm a member here.

355
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,810
Uh, sir?

356
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:44,110
I-i know mr. Gulbrand
well, and you are not he.

357
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,310
What are you doing?

358
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,700
I'm just confirming that
jim gulbrand's a member here.

359
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,710
Why not just ask?

360
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,020
Go ahead. Ask him.

361
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,300
Is jim gulbrand a member here?

362
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,510
I'm sorry, sir. We don't
divulge membership details.

363
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,290
See?

364
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:58,080
This is a murder investigation.
Mr. Gulbrand is dead.

365
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,660
Well, i'm very sorry to hear that.

366
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:00,610
Well, thanks for your help.

367
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:04,710
Oh, sir. Sir, this--
this is a private club.

368
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,890
What i'm learning-- which
is good for our theory--

369
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,650
Is one can't just wander
in here and hang out.

370
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:11,580
One needs a plan.

371
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,580
We're gonna have to take a look around.

372
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:16,170
That's not our policy, sir.

373
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,150
If we have to obtain with a warrant,

374
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,240
we're gonna come back here and take every
computer And every piece of paper in this building,

375
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:22,890
and then we're gonna have a sit-down
chat with each one of your members.

376
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,190
- Welcome to the backgammon club.
- Thank you.

377
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,890
I don't get it. What is she doing?

378
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:43,380
I don't know. Maybe she likes the water.

379
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,330
Aryou feeling better?

380
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:49,180
Eah, much. It's weird.

381
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:53,560
I know brooke harper's not a real doctor,
but whatever she gave me really worked.

382
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,740
Good. I was getting worried about you.

383
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,790
Grace?

384
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,710
- I've been thinking
that maybe-- - Here we go.

385
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:26,410
Rick bregman.

386
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:33,690
The best friend and business partner.

387
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:37,890
Anlover of the ex-wife.

388
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:41,130
Apparently.

389
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:48,820
- Double?
- No. You win.

390
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,890
Outrageous luck you have, no?

391
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,940
You are a monster.

392
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,970
- What is it now?
- What is it?

393
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:58,070
- 20000.
- 20000.

394
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,440
I must have my revenge.

395
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:00,580
Well, if you insist.

396
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,750
- Jane.
- What?

397
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,730
You want me to spell it out?

398
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,090
- We're just having fun, right?
- Ablutely.

399
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,100
The first prince i've ever met.

400
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,120
- How sweet.
- Thank you.

401
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:17,040
There she blows.

402
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:23,220
Uh, prince, uh, can i be
excused from this game?

403
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:26,280
- My date just arrived.
- Of course.

404
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,550
- Maybe that's lucky for me, eh?
- Probably.

405
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,930
$20,000?

406
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:36,270
Enjoy.

407
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:40,110
Hey, listen. Just, uh, just
forget about that, okay?

408
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,510
Certainly not.

409
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,640
You won fair and square.

410
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:45,900
Well, actually, i cheated.
Uh, i controlled the dice.

411
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:50,420
It's in the wrist, just in the wrist.

412
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,330
Please don't be offended. I-i would have taken
your money and given it to a worthy cause,

413
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:57,790
But my friend here is a
moralist of childish simplicity.

414
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:00,500
Nice to meet you.

415
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:16,950
- Hello, gorgeous.
- Beat it, creep.

416
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,470
I'd call you by your real
name, but i don't know wt it is.

417
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,470
Hello, mr. Jane.

418
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,620
I'm impressed. Well done.

419
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:29,380
Oh, for finding you?

420
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,590
It wasn't that difficult.

421
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,900
Would you have a cigar?

422
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,820
Ah, thank you, no.

423
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,790
I hear they're not so
good for your health.

424
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:38,700
Well, who wants to live forever?

425
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,130
It'd be horrible, wouldn't it?

426
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:43,180
Immortality? Imagine the boredom.

427
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:50,240
My friend cho here will now take you by the
wrists so as not to let you escape us again.

428
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,950
Warm hands.

429
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,030
Ah, i bet you say that to
all your arresting officers.

430
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:10,030
who are you, brooke?

431
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,590
How did you find me?

432
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,480
Well, let's make a deal.

433
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:16,220
I'll tell you how we found
you if you tell us who you are.

434
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,100
Okay.

435
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:22,380
My name is angela dalibar, and i'm from
birmingham, england, by way of hong kong.

436
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,050
How did you find me?

437
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,950
I planted a g.p.s.tracking
device on you.

438
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,470
Outstanding technology.

439
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,690
No bigger than a stick of gum.

440
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,140
Can you tell us more
about yourself, angela?

441
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,920
How long have you been
a professional conwoman?

442
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,010
All my life, i suppose.

443
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:40,160
And i confess, my
name's not really angela.

444
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,200
And i didn't plant a
g.p.s.tracking device on you.

445
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,190
How then?

446
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,890
Well, maybe you're not as enigmatic
and elusive as you think you are.

447
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,160
- I wouldn't be so sure of that.
- No?

448
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:56,030
You manipulate people because
you take pleasure in it.

449
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,810
You enjoy being the
smartest person in the room.

450
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,200
You're interested in money, of course,

451
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:04,340
but only so far as it allows
you to continue conning people.

452
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:09,020
You allow yourself one
indulgence-- not men, obviously.

453
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:14,640
Not drinking or drugs, because you fear
that they will impair your abilities.

454
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:16,680
You move around too much to have a pet.

455
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:19,500
So my guess...

456
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,950
Chocolate.

457
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,260
You're good.

458
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:26,220
So why do you do this, brooke?

459
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,830
Neglected as a child?

460
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:30,440
Is this your way of getting attention?

461
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,810
Or is it something a little darker?

462
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,800
Just a genuine mystery, i suppose.

463
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,590
Well, we have your prints now, so
we'll know who you are soon enough.

464
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:41,980
Do you think one can ever
truly know another person?

465
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,060
I doubt it.

466
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:46,170
How do you come to have jim
gulbrand's key in your possession?

467
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:48,400
- He gave it to me.
- Didn't tell you what it would unlock?

468
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:51,380
It wasn't given as a real
key. It was a symbol...

469
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,050
Of our love.

470
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,590
It's the key to his heart.

471
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,260
You said "our love" with conviction.

472
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,590
Are you trying to tell us
that you loved him, too?

473
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,520
Yes, to my great surprise.

474
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,140
I did come to love him, in a way.

475
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,390
- He was a good, kind man.
- So sweet.

476
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,500
Yes, it is.

477
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,160
Yes, this is also the key to a
locker that holds $10 million.

478
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:17,520
Really? I thought it was for cigars.

479
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:21,170
- I love a good cigar.
- Nope. $10 million.

480
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,500
But that's just silly.

481
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:26,530
Why would jim keep $10
million in a locker?

482
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:29,990
- She's good.
- Yeah, she is.

483
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:33,510
What are you doing here?

484
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,420
Duh, looking for the money.

485
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,150
Rick figured maybe there were secret
compartments on the boat or something.

486
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,160
How long have you been seeing
rick bregman romantically?

487
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,810
About a year.

488
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:46,520
You were divorced from jim
gulbrand about a year ago.

489
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:49,550
Were you and rick involved while
you were still married to jim?

490
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:51,280
Involved?

491
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,400
Were you having sexual
intercourse with him?

492
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:56,580
No. Rick would never do that to jim.

493
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,010
But you would.

494
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,940
I ha needs just like anybody else.

495
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,080
I refuse to be ashamed of my needs.

496
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:04,500
Then why did you lie to
us about your relationship?

497
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:06,210
Because i knew how it would look.

498
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,390
You knew it'd make you
look guilty of jim's murder?

499
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,610
No. Yes. It's just...

500
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,760
It wasn't just that.

501
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:17,110
Gaia matrix's stock has
been falling for months.

502
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,990
This market has hurt even
the best of companies.

503
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:23,060
The last thing i need issome "page
six" sex scandal to make things worse.

504
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:25,500
So you misled us in order
to protect your money.

505
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:29,340
I misled you to protect the company
that jim and i built from the ground up.

506
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:33,060
Were you aware that jim gulbrand was
cooperating with s.e.c.investigators?

507
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:35,220
Jim would never go
behind my back like that.

508
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,740
Well, he would, and he did.

509
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:39,790
The question is, if you found
out, what would you do to stop him?

510
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:44,430
This conversation is over.

511
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:47,620
When did you find out about
the $10 million he was hiding?

512
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:51,070
Over.

513
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:58,600
$10 million? That's a lot of money.

514
00:28:58,610 --> 00:28:59,610
Oh, yeah.

515
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,800
Jim trusted you with the
security of his company.

516
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:05,590
He valued your, uh,
outside-the-box thinking.

517
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:08,970
You advised him on what to
do with the money, didn't you?

518
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:10,700
Didn't you?

519
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:14,050
We don't care if hiding the
money was legal or unethical.

520
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,400
Our focus is the homicide investigation.

521
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:19,400
I-it's not that. It's just...

522
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,750
I absolutely promised jim
i wouldn't say anything.

523
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:28,510
We found out jim's girlfriend,
brooke harper, is a conwoman.

524
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:32,120
We think she was after the money and
might have murdered jim to get it.

525
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:38,480
We found her, along with this key, trying to
open gulbrand's cabinet at the backgammon club.

526
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:39,480
The key didn't work.

527
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:43,980
Evidently, she took it from jim, but
she doesn't know where the money is.

528
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:46,540
- That's some lady.
- Oh, yeah.

529
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,480
If you help us find the money, we can
prove that brooke was looking for it,

530
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:52,250
And establish a motive for murder.

531
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,990
So, stuart, do you
know where the money is?

532
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,730
No. Well, n-not exactly, anyway.

533
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,630
Jim did come to me for some
out-of-the-box security advice.

534
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:07,700
Like you said, he wanted to
hide the money from his ex-wife.

535
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:11,720
I told him that safety deposit boxes and
offshore accounts could be traced rather easily,

536
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,350
So they wouldn't be of any use.

537
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,600
So where'd you tell him to hide it?

538
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:16,510
Off the grid.

539
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:20,160
Out of the financial institutions, any
place a trail couldn't be established.

540
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:21,890
- Like a home safe?
- No.

541
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,980
Anything on his property
is subject to search.

542
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:27,550
No, it had to be secure--
obviously, hence the key--

543
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:30,510
But more importantly, it had to be a
place that no one would think to look.

544
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:32,600
- Hidden in plain sight.
- Yes.

545
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,420
But that's the extent of my involvement.

546
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:36,250
I have no idea where he
actually hid the money.

547
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:39,950
Oh, yeah. I see.

548
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,260
Oopsy. Yeah.

549
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,660
Don't want to go losing that, now do we?

550
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,920
What do you make of it?

551
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,060
You think he knows
where jim hid the money?

552
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:56,520
I think he knows the general whereabouts
of the money, but he doesn't know exactly.

553
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:59,940
And the devil is in
the details, isn't he?

554
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:15,340
- Here's what happened.
- I'm all ears.

555
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:20,160
Two weeks ago, you took the locker key
from around jim's neck when he was sleeping

556
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:24,150
And replaced it with an identical
one so jim was none the wiser.

557
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:28,460
Then when you tried to open the
locker at the gym, the key didn't fit.

558
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,960
So the money was hidden
somewhere else, but where?

559
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:36,600
Last friday, you got impatient, and you pushed
jim to tell you where he'd hidden the money.

560
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:40,080
Jim wouldn't tell you. You
got mad, and you killed him.

561
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:41,920
No.

562
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,530
You probably didn't do
it on purpose, did you?

563
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,730
- It was an accident.
- It wasn't.

564
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,930
I didn't do it.

565
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:53,920
Sad thing is, with all your skills,

566
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:56,770
the answer was right
there in front of you.

567
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:59,660
You just didn't see it.

568
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,970
You didn't do enough research.

569
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:07,160
You're playing me.
You don't know either.

570
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,830
Jim's security systems are all
designed by the same man at gaia matrix.

571
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,890
- Stuart hanson.
- Him.

572
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,750
He suggested where to put the money.

573
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:18,670
You could have squeezed the truth
out of him very swiftly, i imagine--

574
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:23,230
Putty to a woman like you-- but
instead, you had to kill a man.

575
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:26,740
I wouldn't do that. You don't know me.

576
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,900
Lindsey smith from san diego.

577
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:32,720
Father ryan, salesman...

578
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,380
Mother debbie, homemaker...

579
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,710
Two miss teen temecula county titles.

580
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:42,090
Varsity softball...

581
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:45,000
Church choir soloist.

582
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:49,670
Then you disappeared off the records for
a couple years, and when you came back,

583
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:53,420
You were a con artist
with two fraud convictions.

584
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,880
What happened?

585
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,990
Nothing happened.

586
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:06,610
I like money, and i'm easily bored.

587
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:10,230
There's gotta be more to it than that.

588
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,830
It's a cold, hard, lonely life you lead.

589
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:18,370
What is it that drives you?

590
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:20,620
Passion for excellence.

591
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:29,460
Okay.

592
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:31,650
Relax a while.

593
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:35,670
Uh, an agent will be in here to run you
through the formal charges against you.

594
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:40,050
Run away. Good luck, lindsey.

595
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:43,910
And to you.

596
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,690
Any luck with harper?

597
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,580
There's no luck involved.

598
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:58,430
- The outcome's a given.
- Is that so?

599
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,050
Yeah, it's all applied
psychology and newtonian physics.

600
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:26,980
Excuse me. Ma'am? Can
i see some i.d., please?

601
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:29,380
You call that a uniform
shirt? It's filthy.

602
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:31,430
- Well, i tried to
clean-- - filthy.

603
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,430
No excuses, stiles.

604
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:37,050
I will address this matter with your
captain at my earliest convenience.

605
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,080
Is she on the move yet?

606
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,920
She made one stop and hasn't
left her motel room since.

607
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,000
- What'd she stop for?
- Chocolate.

608
00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:00,180
Oh, and, uh, thank you.

609
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,800
For what?

610
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:03,900
For just letting this
play out like this.

611
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:06,410
Eh, we would have had to let her
go on the murder charge anyway.

612
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,510
Nothing to keep her on
until we get some hard proof.

613
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:10,270
And besides, this is a simple plan.

614
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:13,590
It's when you start getting costumes
and props that i get nervous.

615
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,920
Trick plays like this?

616
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:17,170
My dad calls them chewing gum plays.

617
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,020
Sometimes you fool the other guy, and
sometimes you just get gum in your hair.

618
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,940
She's moving.

619
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:31,960
Train station. It had
to be a train station.

620
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:34,760
What's wrong with the train station?

621
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:38,210
People, noise, tunnels,
trains, more people.

622
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,570
Her vehicle's stopped
outside the station.

623
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:44,770
Hold your positions
until i give you the word.

624
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:46,940
Yes, boss. Standinby.

625
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:50,090
Copy that.

626
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:56,850
All set.

627
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:01,750
Chewing gum plays.

628
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,150
I can already see my hair
with a big chunk out of it.

629
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:05,440
You'd look good with short hair.

630
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:08,360
Choppy, a litt--kind of
peter pan--good for the eyes.

631
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:09,520
Okay, heads-up.

632
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:12,100
She's in motion,
approaching the station now.

633
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:14,290
Cho, do you have a visual?

634
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,930
Affirmative. She's
exiting the vehicle now.

635
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:33,980
She has stuart hanson with her.

636
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:40,580
She has a gun. Be advised--
brooke harper is armed.

637
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:46,600
Rigsby, van pelt, what's your status?

638
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,390
I have harper and hanson in sight.

639
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,210
Van pelt, she's moving your way.

640
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:53,940
Got 'em. Looks like she's headed
to the commuter lockers. I'm on it.

641
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:19,010
It's the gate. I'm stuck.

642
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,280
All right, don't move.

643
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,670
Don't do anything and
don't say anything.

644
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:26,230
This better be the right place.

645
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,670
She opened the locker. I
think she has the money.

646
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:46,930
- Okay, i-- - uh,
wait.Just--just wait a moment.

647
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:56,290
Oh, my.

648
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:01,190
Don't move or i'll kill you.

649
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,180
Don't move!

650
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:23,910
- ****Hanson.
- I got him. Excuse me.

651
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:26,380
Gun.

652
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:39,000
You're under arrest... Again.

653
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,650
Let's go.

654
00:38:54,040 --> 00:39:00,770
Jason bradshaw, jason wade, anthony
wade, anthony samuels, the list goes on--

655
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:06,380
All aliases you've used in scams ranging
fro identity theft to ponzi schemes.

656
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:08,940
- You're quite the virtuoso.
- Thank you.

657
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:13,950
But this one-- this would have been your
most daring and successful crime yet.

658
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:17,890
$10 million of jim gulbrand's money.

659
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:24,090
Gulbrand was the perfect mark--
rich, liquid and unconventional.

660
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,700
I bet he didn't even check your
references when he hired you.

661
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:29,790
Nothing says trustworthy
like a wheelchair.

662
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:35,800
You convinced gulbrand that the train
station was a genius place to hide his money.

663
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:38,270
Screw orthodox wisdom.

664
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:41,640
Think sideways, right? Right?

665
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:44,050
And he ate it up.

666
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,550
He ate it up.

667
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:49,680
Why wouldn't he? Then you
simply needed to get the key.

668
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,010
You went to the yacht that night
because you knew he'd be alone.

669
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,640
You also knew he kept the key with him.

670
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:11,560
You did what needed to be done.

671
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:14,750
You killed jim gulbrand.

672
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,360
Then you got rid of the body.

673
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,420
But you didn't count on brooke harper.

674
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:38,140
You couldn't have known
she swapped the real key...

675
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,800
With a look-alike.

676
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:43,140
You didn't realize anything was wrong
until you tried to open the locker.

677
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:49,930
It wasn't until we came to
gaia matrix with the real key...

678
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:52,730
That it dawned on you what she'd done.

679
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:56,050
I can only imagine your surprise.

680
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:59,720
Six months living in that chair.

681
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:02,910
Six months, and no one
ever questioned me about it.

682
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:05,180
Why did you?

683
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:09,630
Whenever i meet someone in a wheelchair,
i check the bottoms of their shoes.

684
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:18,880
The bottoms of your shoes...

685
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:21,690
Were scuffed.

686
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:26,720
I've been checking shoes for years. This
is the first time it's ever paid off.

687
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:28,450
First time.

688
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,360
That's gratifying, man.
Very, very gratifying.

689
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,660
Oh, he's a pistol, isn't he?

690
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,110
Sorry about the cuffs.

691
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,920
- My own fault.
- Oh, yeah.

692
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:02,610
Wi i could let you go
again, but you know...

693
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,650
I understand.

694
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:08,730
That urge you have to
get one over on people,

695
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:11,800
the need to be smarter
than the next guy...

696
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:15,390
It'll keep biting you on the ass.

697
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,970
So my butt'll hurt occasionally.

698
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:21,230
I'll still be smarter than the next guy.

699
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,600
Brooke harper?

700
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:29,030
No, jessica waters.
Th-that's harper right there.

701
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,350
Uh, agent? This is harper.

702
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:36,280
- Worth a try.
- Of course.

703
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:38,070
Brooke harper, i'm agent fred hayes.

704
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:42,010
I'll be in charge of transporting you
to the federal detention center in davis.

705
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,720
Let's go.

706
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,890
See you around, patrick.

707
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:57,400
I doubt you'll be seeing much
of anybody for a few years.

708
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:59,450
Oh, i don't know about
that, agent hayes.

709
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:02,260
She's very good at what she does.

710
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:05,670
Yeah.
