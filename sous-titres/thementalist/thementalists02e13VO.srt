1
00:00:11,493 --> 00:00:14,471
Mr. Norris, one of my guys
show you the Lamborghini.

2
00:00:14,596 --> 00:00:16,880
It's your new car.
You just don't know it yet.

3
00:00:17,686 --> 00:00:20,728
- The McLaren looks good on you.
- Not tonight.

4
00:00:21,018 --> 00:00:23,737
A lot of fellas out there.
They've got to sell station wagons,

5
00:00:23,862 --> 00:00:25,302
minivans. This?

6
00:00:25,749 --> 00:00:27,263
I don't have to sell this.

7
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:30,031
This is the good life on wheels,
stem to stern.

8
00:00:30,356 --> 00:00:32,772
The trunk's bigger
than my first apartment.

9
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:38,447
Liselle.

10
00:00:44,407 --> 00:00:46,275
Agent Rigsby, what do we have?

11
00:00:46,772 --> 00:00:49,729
Liselle Douglas,
salesperson here, age 28.

12
00:00:49,938 --> 00:00:52,551
Blunt trauma, numerous contusions,
possible skull fracture.

13
00:00:53,017 --> 00:00:55,137
No obvious signs
of no sexual assault.

14
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:57,098
What?

15
00:00:57,626 --> 00:00:59,475
I just love that new car smell.

16
00:00:59,876 --> 00:01:01,102
Time of death?

17
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,104
She was last seen here last night.

18
00:01:03,367 --> 00:01:05,314
Private security
did a sweep at midnight,

19
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:07,858
reported the alarm system
hadn't been activated.

20
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,485
She was probably dead by then.

21
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:11,612
Let's get the body out,
see what we find out.

22
00:01:11,862 --> 00:01:12,912
You got it.

23
00:01:14,393 --> 00:01:16,030
That's expensive, huh?

24
00:01:16,254 --> 00:01:18,965
$300,000 retail.
Probably get a discount now, though.

25
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,771
- Who found the body?
- James Kinsey.

26
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:29,588
He's in the John right now.
Brad Elias.

27
00:01:29,951 --> 00:01:31,340
Who could have done this?

28
00:01:32,131 --> 00:01:33,342
None. It was horrible.

29
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:34,969
This is a tragedy.

30
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:36,887
- We're like a family here.
- Family.

31
00:01:37,957 --> 00:01:38,989
That's cute.

32
00:01:39,378 --> 00:01:40,349
Excuse me?

33
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,351
You work on commission, right?

34
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,772
- Sure.
- Then you're not a family at all.

35
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:46,230
You're a gladiator pit.

36
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:47,773
You're a seething mass

37
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,942
of primal hostility and mistrust.

38
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:50,943
No.

39
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,779
People have the wrong idea
about sales.

40
00:01:54,169 --> 00:01:56,240
There's a lot of respect
among us, right, guys?

41
00:01:56,614 --> 00:01:58,951
Clearly you're a top dog
amongst this pack here.

42
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,078
The question is,
who's the fastest runner?

43
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:02,830
Runner?

44
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,909
Liselle's clients are gonna need
a new broker, aren't they?

45
00:02:06,034 --> 00:02:07,460
And I think that my associate,

46
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,795
agent Cho here,
left her client list upstairs.

47
00:02:10,373 --> 00:02:11,547
In your break room.

48
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:13,215
It might be

49
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,801
a little ghoulish
to grab it up so soon,

50
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,977
but it is still up there,
and someone, at some point, will...

51
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,534
I've got the client list right here.
It's evidence.

52
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:25,114
What did you do that for?

53
00:02:25,381 --> 00:02:27,739
I have eliminated this man
from any suspicion.

54
00:02:27,864 --> 00:02:29,482
Too honest to profit from a killing?

55
00:02:29,888 --> 00:02:31,358
Too honest to kill.
Right?

56
00:02:31,914 --> 00:02:32,735
Right.

57
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,378
Guys, break it up.

58
00:02:38,542 --> 00:02:41,202
Unless, you're very cunning
and you're working a double bluff.

59
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,506
No, I didn't think so.
