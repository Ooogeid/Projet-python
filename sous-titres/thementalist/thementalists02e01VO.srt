Oh,yeah. Why'd you kill rassmussen?

Now,you,miss grumpy and
entitled,what's your story?

My name is mandy shultz.And
i'll havyou know that my--

52
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,870
let me guess. Your husband
is a very important person.

53
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,470
He is,as it happens.

54
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,960
John's on the modesto city council.

55
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:05,100
And this is totally
unprofessional and disrespectful.

56
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,150
I'll have my husband take
thp with your superiors.

57
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,230
Mandy,mandy,mandy. The diet
pills are messing with your mind.

58
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,860
This is sacramento,the big city.
Your husband means nothing here.

59
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,340
Okay,that's enough. Agent lisbon?

60
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:19,040
- Give him another moment.
- Don't need a moment. Ca is all but closed.

61
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,970
- Mandy here is gonna lead us right to the murder weapon.
- What?

62
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,730
Take my hands. I need physical
contact to read your mind.

63
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,600
- You're nuts.
- Ove it.

64
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:29,730
If i'm wrong,if we can't find the
murder weapon,then i look like an idiot.

65
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,620
Yes,you will.

66
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:39,460
- What are you--
- don't speak.

67
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,800
The murder weapon.

68
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,200
This is crazy. I had
no idea that was there.

69
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,290
How could u direct us right to
it if you didn't put it there?

70
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:42,280
I didn't. I-i don't know.

71
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,370
But i-i didn't kill
that man. I-i didn't!

72
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,610
- She's right. She has nothing to do with the murder.
- What?

73
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:51,780
I just used her as a decoy to lull the real
killer into giving me clean directional cues.

74
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,030
Oh,come on. What are
you talking about now?

75
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,350
Whatever way he didn't wants
to go is the way that we went.

76
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,840
- The real killer.
- Yeah,you wanna guess who it is?

77
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,320
Come on,jane.

78
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,690
Neil.

79
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,600
Excusee. No,i--it wasn't.
I-i dot even know thatan.

80
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:09,580
Oh,is that rit?

81
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,990
I'm guessing that he was having
an affair withour current wife.

82
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,420
You found out and you
forgave her like a sucker.

83
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:20,800
He saw you here,probably smirked and said
something very clever,made you feel... Small.

84
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,400
Humiliated you!

85
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:36,060
- Nice work.
- What? Case is closed,isn't it?

86
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,420
Put it down!

87
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,510
I sa drop it now!

91
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,570
A dead suspect,quarter-million
dollars worth of damages,

92
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,620
formal complais of
misconduct from the s.P.D.

93
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,260
And the modesto cityouncil.

94
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,010
Those damages wereay padded.

95
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,830
All due respect,virgil,i
was trying to close the case.

96
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,320
It was my feeling that red
john should be our priority,

97
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,990
- given the dozen frh
leads-- - Stop!stop.

98
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,500
That's the nub of the
problem righthere--red john.

99
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,010
Ever since the tanner incident,you've
been runnin' way too hot.

100
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,950
I fear a terminal screw up coming.

101
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,260
That's not gonna happen. I can hand him.

102
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,030
Can you?

103
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,260
Maybe since he saved your
life,you're going easy on him.

104
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:33,900
Maybe you feel compelled
cut him somslack.

105
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:37,420
No,sir. Ths absolutely not the case.

106
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,850
Hey,sam,get in here.

107
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,290
- Lisbon.
- Bosco.

108
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,930
Agent bosco and his unit are
taking over the red john case.

109
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,780
What? No,no,no.

110
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:55,340
You have always been too close to the
case,and now both of you are way o close.

111
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,650
We need to make a change.

112
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,590
- Can we talk about this?
- No.

113
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,160
You've worked for agent bosco.
You ow that heill do the job right.

114
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:04,280
You ed to let my team
finish what they started.

115
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,550
Teresa,no offense,but you guys aren't
even close to catching this guy.

116
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,450
Fresh set of eye gotta be aogd idea.

117
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,870
What do you know about the case?

118
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,860
Not much. He's a serl killer.

119
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,770
15 victims,including
your wife and child.

120
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,180
I can imagine your pain.

121
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:25,580
Maybe that pain is
clouding your judgment.

122
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,670
And me,sam? What's clouding my judgment?

123
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,040
Good question. You tell .

124
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,780
What happened?

125
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,950
We're off red john.

126
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,170
- What?
- Forever?

127
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,320
- Rrwill we get reprimanded?
- Who gets it instead?

128
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,120
Quiet.

129
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:07,800
Look,this is my fault,but it's
a wake-upall for all of us.

130
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,940
We've grown slack and unprofessional.

131
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:12,690
We neeto earn back e
trust thatewve lost.

132
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,220
From now on,we work 100% straight.

133
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,520
No more shortcuts.No
more ga--

134
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,930
what are you doing?

135
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,590
You're leaving?

136
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:31,210
Well,frankly,if i can't use this job to
seek some kind of personal revenge,thenuh,

137
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,670
there's not a whole lot here for me.

138
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:40,270
But i-i... I don'make anything better.

139
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,470
I can't brindead people back
to life. What good do we do?

140
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:47,940
We drive around california
visitingappy people.

141
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:50,210
We're fighng evil and injustice.

142
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,990
And how's that going?
Any progress lately?

143
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,150
We put bad guys away where ey
can't hurt people. That's gd enough.

144
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,440
I was doing more good as a psychic.

145
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,850
I was givingeople hope,at least.

146
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:03,480
- False hope,but hope anyway.
- Van pelt.

147
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:05,400
You're right. Best you leave.

148
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:10,260
That way you can go back to bei a full-time fraud
and we can continue our useless jobs in peace.

149
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,780
- Well,that's actually not what i said.
- Yes,it was.

150
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:15,170
- We're up. Twenty palms.
- Let's go. Yocome,too,an pt.

151
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,740
We'll take two vehicles
in case need to split up.

152
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,810
I'll see you when you get there.

153
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:42,140
Boss,disrespect,but i ink we need jane.

'Ll manage.Maybe we
don't cse as many cases,

155
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:49,180
but the ones we do close will
be closed right,by prossionals.

156
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,410
Vapelt,it's not a jet plane.

157
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,950
Okay,okay,okay.

158
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,840

Oh,i'm t gonna leave you in the lurch.

00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:54,770
ran license down alrdy. It a
fake. We're calling her jane doe.

168
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,750
Who found the body?

169
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:58,460
The building manager noticed
her door was open overnight.

170
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,410
Last one down to the left.

171
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,710
Thank you.

172
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,120
What's your take?

173
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:47,130
Hit with a stun gun en
suffocated with the cushion.

174
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,050
And they were looking
for something,obviously.

175
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,990
Did they find it,grace?

176
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:55,760
It's impossible to tell.

177
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,600
Well,it seems they look
everywhere possible. Yes?

178
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,220
Yeah.

179
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:04,260
So we can assume that they
didn't find it,whatever it is.

180
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,640
How so?

181
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:08,450
Well,let's say there's a
ndred places to look r a thing.

182
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,350
How likely is it that you will
find it in the hundred pla you look?

183
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,890
- Not very likely,right?
- What else you got?

184
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:20,170
No drug paraphernali no condoms or
other items suggesting prostitution.

185
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:24,220
So... Maybe a personal
crime? A husband or lover?

186
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,480
Bravo,grace.

187
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:28,180
Wrong,i expec but very
welreasoned nonetheless.

188
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:38,070
Thank you,all. Appreciate it.

189
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,270
Thing off the car,but we'll
have the lab boys take a look.

190
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:44,140
It's still registered to the previous
owner,sold it for cash six months ago.

191
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:47,150
So basically we know nothing
about her. Nice start.

192
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,410
She's a law-iding middle-class
housewife that did something bad,

193
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,890
something she feels
terriblyuilty about--

194
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,590
guilty enough to make
her run away and hide.

195
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:00,990
That's evidence. Yoknow the drill.

196
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:07,440
You put "bullfrogs win high schbasketball
trophy" into a search engine,

197
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:10,440
we will find jane doe's home.

198
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,590
- Can i take a look at that?
- Sure.

199
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:16,740
It's a working truck. Dad must be
in construct something like that.

200
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,650
Bayshore courier,ril 2006.

201
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,110
"county finals--la bulrogs
dominate inju-plagueders.

202
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,860
If they list the players,cross-check
the surnames with the other arcles

203
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,990
from the same newspaper in the last
year using the word disappearae."

204
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,950
" if we leave now,we can be i
bayshore in a couplef hours."

205
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:34,230
oh,we need a ttle more than
lady bullfrogs to go on.

206
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,710
"bayshore courier" of june this year.

207
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,930
Headline is "pice no
closer to dunninger."

208
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:44,400
"since her disappearance last month,bayshore

209

00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,300
from her employers,the
jaffe printing group."

211
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:54,730
Okay. Bayshore it is then.

212
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,180
So the killer must've been
looking for the million bucks.

213
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:00,230
If she had a million bucks,why
would she live in a dump like this?

214
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,340
Before we get on the freeway,it'd be good to
take a little drive around the neighborhood,

215
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,550
be good to find anmpty house for sale.

216
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,230
Why would that bgood?

217
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,980
I'm thinking of moving here.

218
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:16,050
No secrets,jane. No lies. No
tricks. No surprises. The truth.

219
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,300
Since when is that thrule?

220
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,150
Since i said so.

221
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:22,500
- Else what?
- You're off the unit.

222
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:25,780
That's not leve. This
is my last case,remember?

223
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:30,290
Thonly reason i'm still here is 'cause i'm
worried about how you guys would cope withoume.

224
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,910
Oh,really? So wre lost

225
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,130

00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,630
Let's go.

227
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:43,190

Nothing,really. Totaerreaction. Yeah.

230
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,100
We need to find a house for sale.

231
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,390
Ok.

232
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,520
Ah,there's a sign.

233
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,000
Perfect.

234
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,940

241
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,760
Gd. Cho,rigsby,start
canvassing the neighbors.

242
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,960
Van pelt,come with me.

243

Uh,i... Lisbon,uh...

You know i dn't mean that.

248
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,710
So the job is worthwhile,is it?

249
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,340
Eh,it's not that. I mean,it's
not that at all. It's just...

250
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:24,400
I have nothing else to do.

251
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:29,950
No jokes. From now on,there
have to be boundaries.

252
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,060
Agreed.

253
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:35,540
I need to know that you can do your work and be
effective withoucreating a mess th i have to clean up.

254
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:38,160

So how did she die?

259
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,710
It s a hocide,but she didn't suffer.

260
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,690
We don't have any suspects yet.

261
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,230
Where was she?

262
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,610
She was ling alone in a small
apartment in twenty palms.

263
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,140
I thought she'd be living
it up inexico or somepla.

264
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,370
- She was
always-- - stop it.

265
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,160
I need to lie down.

266
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:13,580
Okay,champ,let's roll.

267
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:22,120

- Noank you.

268
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:24,760
Oh,oh,i-i'd love a cup. Thanks.

269
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:38,430
Ansel,uh,had cancer. He's
totally better now but still weak.

270
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,180
- It's in remission?
- Gone.

271
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,820
100%. We were blessed. Even
the doctors were amazed.

272
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,050
Oh,thank you. Tell mabouyour mother.

273
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,600
Sure. I'll tell you.

274
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:58,890
Ng all that money and running off--
that was just the icing on the cake.

275
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:05,150
When ansel got cancer,her wa coping--
painkillers and a sleazebag lover.

276
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:08,520
That's mom.

277
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:10,660
Did u know her lover's name?

278
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,600
Bodhi andros.

279
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:18,090
How fou out?

280
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:22,050
Ansel goes to meet his mom
at her yogarobics class.

281
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:26,180
He finds her banging
the teaer in his office.

282
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,790
Can you imine?

283
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:30,730
- Then wt happened?
- She did her dance.

284
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:37,380
She's so ashamed,she's so
sorry,she's changed. Whatever.

285
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:41,190
And d was halfway to fgiving her.

286
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,450
He c't help it. He loves her.

287
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,220
But yodon' love her?

288
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,040
She... Never had time for me. So.

289
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:53,190
I cod always see through
her chm. You know?

290
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:55,300
To the selfish
cow beneath--

291
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:59,500
kessie!Don't talk that way. E loved you.

292
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,910
Look,she's dead. Show some respect.

293
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:13,920
She was a beautiful soul,full
of joy an-and big dreams.

294
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:17,140
And reality just kinda beat h down.

295
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:21,450
But here's the thing. It was only
because the robbery was in the news that

296
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:26,460
the doctors at cedars of zion heard
about ansel anreached out to help us.

297
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,890
They took him on for free
and they sav his life--

00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:34,160
saved his life when everybody
id there was no hope.

299
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:38,530
You know,god works inysterious ways.

00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,420
This is like committin' adultery here.

Let me communicate this to you.

374
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:59,350
You're a party entertainer,a clown.

375
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,190
Fresh leads?

376
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:04,980
I wouldn't tell you where the
bathroom is if your ass was on fire.

377

I untand you. It may take you
some time to understand me.

379
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:17,160
You're filled with equal parts
self-loathing and self-love.

380
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:19,250
You're addicted to control.

381
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:20,680
You're terrified of confinement.

382
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,580
who's my favorite beatle?

383
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,640
Your wife wanted you to
quit the psychic trade.

384
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:28,320
She begged you to stop,but
you were making too much money.

385
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:30,080
You were havin' too much fun.

00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:44,730
Looktrick,i'm sorry to
be so blunt with you.

391

Really?

392
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:55,070
You're not a detective. You're a victim.

393
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:06,910
<i>****</i>

00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:10,670

If you sown byhe riverbank
and wait long enough,

00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:53,510
you will see the bies
of your enemies float by.

00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:58,280
Shall we?

408
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,300
Agent lisbon,is it?

00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,590
Thank you so much for taki

412
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:15,220
Oh,not at all. And you wanted to meet

Oh,yeah. I know everyone on staff.

416
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:27,210
So sad. The whole thing is
just so sad. The poor woman.

417
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,620
More troubled than conniving,i'm sure.

418
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:33,120
And you know,it's not the money.

419
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:35,470
It's more the loss of trust.

420
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,680
This is very,very mh a family firm.

421
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:43,910

is aboulues,not about machinery.

Patrick jane.

435
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,260
We're investigating the
murder of monica nninger.

436
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:31,940
Yes. Terrible. Horrible.

437
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:34,320
You were her direct
supervisor,ishat right?

438
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:38,700
I know wt you're gonna say,and ye
yes,it was my fault that shetole from us.

439
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:41,210
Mea culpa. I-i should've known.

440
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,910
Greg is like family
ticall we all make mistakes

441
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,800
we live,we learn,we move on.

442
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:51,200
Uh,can you explaito us w
she did ? In layman's terms?

443
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,130
Been there,done that with the top
men from the fbi financial unit.

444
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,640
Do we really need to ger it again?

445
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:01,040
- Yes.
- No problem.

446
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,940
Ank you.

447
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,210
What exactly was her position he?

448
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,120
Assistant office manager.

449
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:14,610
She kept the petty ca accounts.

450
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,760
Coffee and doughnut monitor essentially.

451
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:19,140
This was her office.

452
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,700
How did she manage to
steal so much money?

453
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:24,820
When the accounting and
finance systems were integrated,

454
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:28,030
nobody thought to firewall
the tty cash accounts.

455
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:33,520
Monica acquired user access to the
transactional sites and created a false vendor.

456
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:36,170
I didn't think s had the brains,to be .

457
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,870
We don't know exactly how she did it

458
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:44,080
because she frd her hard drive and
e took her accountsook with her.

459
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:46,370
Are we about to look at
a ole bunch of numbers?

460
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,380
Probably.

461
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:51,280
- All right. I'll wait in the car.
- Go.

462
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:56,040
Do you know a man named miles thorsen?

463
00:29:56,990 --> 00:30:00,020
- No.
- You sure? Think about it.

464
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,810
- I'm sure. Who is he?
- Never mind.

465
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:05,150
Please continue.

466
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:08,640
Would you excuse me?

467
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:10,410
Ss,i think i found something.

468
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,730
The victim's daughter,ssie dunninger--
shhandles the family money,pays the bills.

469
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:18,920
Five months ago,she stopped paying the
rent by standing order,switched to cash.

470
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,970
Me thing with the utity
bills. Paid in cash.

471
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:25,540
Nice work. A andalto her. She doesn't
have a good answer,bring her in.

472
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:28,430
Will do,boss. Yes!

473
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,820
Y did you hiderom us,bodhi?

474
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:43,990
Fear,man. Fear.

475
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:46,720
I've been frightened for
my life er since i heard.

476
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:49,370
- Why?
- Who killed her?

477
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,830
Either it was her goober hnd finally
snapped,ich puts me next in line,

478
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:56,100
or it's whoever she went into business
with,and maybe they think i know too much.

479
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:58,030
She was in business with someone?

480
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:01,110
Just before she disappeared,she
came by to see me,

481
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:05,300
told me she made a business deal with
someone that would make everything all right.

482
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,600
- A business deal? Were those the words she used?
- Yep.

483
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:13,610
She was starting a new day in
her life and wanted to make amends

484
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:17,760
and apogize for being such a
pain in theutt,which she was.

485
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:18,450
How so?

486
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:24,510
She was way too deep into her fily
and to her kids and all that crap.

487
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,030
Loved those kids.

488
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:31,350
Why do i want to talk to her about
her sick boy? Like i can help?

489
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,620
- You'reot a doctor.
- Exactly.

490
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:38,320
When we were caught
by that kid,she just...

491
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,960
Went to pieces,you know?

492
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:45,140
And i'm like,don't get
so down on yourself.

493
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:50,410
You gotta love u en if
you're a total screw up,right?

494
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:54,820
The greatest. Love... Of all.

495
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,650
Whitney was right,as usual.

496
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,320

00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,050

00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:34,690
About a month after
shran off,mom called me,

503
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:38,830
said she wanted to help out,wanted
to know how ansel was doing.

504
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:43,230
She loves us so much,blah,blah,blah.

505
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:47,260
I told her to go to hell,and i hung up.

506
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:51,630
2 days later,i got a letter
with $5,000 in cash inside.

507
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,300
Any message?

508
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:57,410
Julove,mom." thth was it.

509
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:00,930
What was i supposed to
do,give it to the police?

510
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,410
Actually,yes.

511
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:06,130
Well,i didn't. We
really needed the money.

512
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:13,020
- Did you ever tell your dad about the mo .
- No.

513
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:15,420
How often did shsend you money?

514
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,650
$5,000 every month.

515
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:21,470
- Did you ever write back to her?
- No.

516
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,670
- I like h for this.
- How so?

517
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,630
She desp mom.

518
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:29,780
Mom's got $1 million stolen dolla,gets
in contact secretly. Do t eath.

519
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:32,580
- Maybe.
- No? What's your take?

520
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,180
I'd be guessing. Could be anybody.

521
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:37,800
Not anybody. Youidn't
do it. I didn't do it.

522
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:41,780
You're distracted. You're
thinking about bosco and red john.

523
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,940
Focus on the job at hand.

524
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:46,750
You're glad bosco has the
red john case,aren't you?

525
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,380
Bosco is good agent.
He's as gothey come.

526
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:53,230
It might not be such a bad thing that we're
off t case for a while. We got too ose.

527
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,540
- Is that what your shrink tells u?
- Everybody tells me that.

528
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,480
But your shrink didtell
you that,didn't he?

529
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:59,920
Okay,may--maybe you're right.
Maybe--maybe that's the truth.

530
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:02,020
Maybe we did get a little
too close. I'm not so sure.

531
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:04,110
- But i'll think about it.
- Liar.

532
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,170
I've got a deposition.

533
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:09,290
See that box ever there? It's got
mica dunninger's possessionin it.

534
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:12,580
- Go through it,see what you can see.
- Yes,ma'am.

535
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:22,120
Uh,whwants to come with me out
to twenty lms to catch the killer?

536
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:24,480

537
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,960
Of course.

538
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,520
- What is this place?
- Guess.

539
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:43,000
- Mis thorsen's house.
- Exactly.

540
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:45,210
Who's miles thorsen?

541
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:50,550
- I haveo idea.
- ****

542
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,270
Isn't that your number?

543
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,810
Uh,yeah,that's my number. That's in
case the killer gets here before us.

544
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,880
That way,he'll call us.

545
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,600
Wh's that over there?

546
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,350
- Hey,we have no warrant.
- Don't you hear someone yelling in there?

547
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,720
- No.
- I heard something.

548
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,960
There's no yelling. I have perfect hng.

549
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:17,880
I could ear i heard someone.

550
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:28,130
Okay,so what are we doing here?

551
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:32,200
Erybody involved is
wondering who miles thorsen .

552
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,630
The killer will be doub
curious. Triply,even.

553
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:42,050
Maybe the mysterious miles thorse has what
the killer is looking for,what heidn't find.

554
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:45,800
When they look him up,ty'll learn there's a
miles thorsen who lives rind the rner from monica.

555
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:49,010
- Hey,resto.
- This is extly the kind ostuff the boss was tking about.

556
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,260
She didn't okay this at all,did she?

557
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,610
So shoot me.

558
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:58,630
"the fax machine revolution--the
little box that'sing our world."

559
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,450
why would monica dunninger
be reading this book?

560
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,680
You,cho,shouldn't
enable this kind of crap.

561
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:05,040
We're not doing anything
wrong. What's the problem?

562
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:08,810
Uh,burglary,espassing,willful
damage to property.

563
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:11,540
- Yeah,door was open.
- Uh,no,it wasn't.

564
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:15,300
- Of course.
- What?

565
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:18,010
Rigsby,you' right. You shouldn't
be here. Let us take this.

566
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,680
- You go find the nearest library.
- Why?

567
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,170
Your punishmfor being a wuss
is i'm not gonna tell ya.

568
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:27,450
- Oh,come on.
- Nope,i'm not gonna tell you.

569
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,760
Fine. Fine. Whatever.

570
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:33,240
Call when you're there.

571
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,980
So what's the gag?

572
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,170
Oh,there's no gag. I solved the case.

573
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,530
I thought you already dithat. I
thought that's why we're waiting here.

574
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,780
Nope. This is,uh...

575
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:49,940
Well... Thiss more of
a fishing expedition.

576
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:54,830
You know,maybe we get a bite. Maybe
we don't. That's the fun of it.

577
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:59,160
We just sit back,relax,dangle
our feet in the water.

578
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:14,640
This guy predicted th by the year 2000,

579
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:18,620
every american household
will have a fax machine.

580
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,720
Can u believe that?

581
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,990
I had a fax mach you?

582
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,970
Yeah.

583
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,220
Nostradamus of officequipment.

584
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:32,060
See,this is why i dot like fishing.

585
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:35,630
- E not goa catch ything.
- We have some very tasty bait.I'm ry confide

586
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,940
did you consider that the
killer found the money alrey?

587
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:41,430
I don't think it was money theyere looking
for. I don't think monica ever h it.

588
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,550
Then wt did she have then?
And who has the money?

589
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:49,050
Great bone original mid century
detail. Great new copper piping.

590
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:54,720
Hello. Did you have
a fax machine in 2000?

591
00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:00,080
No cause for alarm,sir. We're
law enforcement officers. Cbi.

592
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:06,350
Kimball... Cho. Okay.

593
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,040
What are you doing
here,kimball? Is there a problem?

594
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:12,700
It's an ongoing investigation,sir.
Can give out any details.

595
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:15,340
Grisly homide,though.

596
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:20,450
N't we take a look at that
duplexn royston? Shall we?

597
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:23,780
That's a good call.

598
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:29,210
- Damn it.
- Relax.

599
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,810
He got my name.

600
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:33,570
Well,you spoke the truth. We
are an ongoing investigation.

601
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,640
Yeah,but we're supped to
be working 100% straight.

602
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,670
This isot that.

603
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,040
I'm--i'm sorry.
Wr-wrong address.

604
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:51,900
Rhonda! Come back.

605
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:58,780
I'm here out of curiosity,that's all.

606
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,680
Well,of course.

607
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,210
I've got nothing else
to say without my lawyer.

608
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:09,590
U don't need to say anything.

609
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,430
I knew it was you from the start.

610
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,080
Thanksor sring.

611
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:17,680
Well,when i say i-i knew it
was her,i-i mean,i-i guessed,

612
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:20,210
i subconsciously thought it was her

613
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:25,670
when i saw a photo of her holding
large check outside cedars of zion.

614
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:30,290
It was you that stole the $1
million from your own compan

615
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:33,240
why would i do that?

616
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,950
Well,degenerate gambling would be
my gu but whatever youproblem is,

617
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:41,280
when threatened with exposure,you
made a deal with poor monica.

618
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:44,540
If she'd take the blame and disappea

619
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:48,100
you'd get ansel into the best
cancer program in california

620
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:51,720
and pay her a monthly wage to stay gone.

621
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:53,240
That's absurd.

622
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:58,880
But then ansel got cured,and there's way
monica was gonna stay gone,not much longe

623
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:01,990
then you had to silence her.

624
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:05,730
That's pure fiction.
Yohave no proof at all.

625
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:09,080
We--we have
proof. Wait.

626
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:11,610
Yeah,we got--there
it is. Yep.

627
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,330
This is gonna be good.

628
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,370
Yep,i'm here. I know,i know.

629
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:25,320
The fax machine revolution is a library
book,and monica dunning swapped it.

630
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:30,670
Hold on. I'm checking it. All right.

631
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,410
Got it. Hold up.

632
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:39,240
Looks like an accountsook.

633
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,490
There's a dvd in it.

634
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,150
This is just to say that...

635
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:49,830
In case something happen to me,

636
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,920
that i swear on the bible

637
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:57,100
that everyg in the account book theruth.

638
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,340
I know that i've prettmuch lost
your love and respect for good.

639
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:09,850
But i hope that this dl at i've
made will help ansel get better

640
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:15,800
and will make up for some
of the hurt that i've caused.

641
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:21,340
I love you all so much,

642
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:27,760
especially you,keie,even
though you ink i don't.

643
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:34,950
I'm st so soy for this
mess that i've made.

644
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:41,710
Please forgive me. Goodye.

645
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,820
The book spells out the deal.

646
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:53,550
Monica took the fall for her boss so that
ansel would have the best possible treatment.

647
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,350
Nice work.

648
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:30,120
Sam bosco here. Cbi major
crimes program. Question.
