00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,310
Are you mr.Black?

3
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,750
Yeah.

4
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,750
You scared me.

5
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,990
So... I just...

6
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:46,370
Tell me why i'm here.

7
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,550
I have something i need done.

8
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,800
So do most women.You're gonna
have to be more specific.

9
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,130
Right.Yes.Sorry.

10
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:01,460
Um,what i need... I don't
know quite how to put it.

11
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,230
Well,you're just gonna
have to open your mouth

12
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:09,880
And say it out loud in full detail,Like
you're talking to your priest.

13
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,580
You show me yours.I'll show
you mine.That's how it works.

14
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,330
Okay.

15
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,100
Here.

16
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,030
I want you to kill him.

17
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,820
How much do you charge?

<i>****</i>

22
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,650
We think she was killed
about an hour ago.

23
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,770
Neighbor heard screaming,called 9-1.

24
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:51,960
Anybody see anything?

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,600
We've got sac p.d.canvassing,but so
far nothing-- Just an average night.

26
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,830
Average night,average
neighborhood,Average murder.

27
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,520
Why are we here?

28
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:04,240
Because the victim is assistant
district attorney kelly flower.

29
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,980
- You worked with her.
- Yeah,we all did.

30
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,100
Kelly was good people.

31
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,920
Forensics found a
casing.Said it was 9-mil.

32
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,380
Almost point-blank,judging
from the stippling.

33
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,870
Deputy coroner said no sexual assault,But
her nightgown's ripped and tangled.

34
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,330
She was crawling in it.

35
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,630
Remodel?

36
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,190
Kelly's one of us.

37
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,900
Hightower's already
approved the overtime.

38
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,370
You know the drill.

39
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,100
Why is that the drill?

40
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:34,230
I mean,for everyone else,It just
looks like for your own,you try harder.

41
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,340
We do.

42
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,700
It's a deterrent.

43
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:41,420
It sends out a message--nobody gets
away with killing a cop,A judge or a d.a.

44
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,160
cho can get a list of kelly's cases,

45
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,210
See who she put away that held a grudge.

46
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,920
It's not a deterrent.It's
revenge,really.

47
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,450
I mean,and that's not a
criticism,'Cause i'm all about revenge.

48
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,270
I mean,revenge can be very productive.

49
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,870
- Productive?
- Well,take rigsby.

50
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,150
Van pelt breaks up with him.Now
he's in the best shape of his life.

51
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,240
I mean,he's hitting the
gym,what,six times a week?

52
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,590
Look at him.

53
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,540
He is brimming with sexual confidence.

54
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,170
Jane,cut it out.

55
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,950
Not on my account.It's fine.

56
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:11,980
See?Fine.My point--there is
nothing wrong with revenge.

57
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,630
Van pelt,any damage to the
windows or the back door?

58
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,840
No,nothing.

59
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,200
No sign of forced entry,so
either she let him in,or...

60
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,460
Husband's here.

61
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,370
He let himself in.

62
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:32,190
Oh,my god!No!Kelly,no!No!No!God,no!

63
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,200
Tiffany wants you to call her back.

64
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,570
Oh,thanks.

65
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,500
Said to tell you you're a very bad boy.

66
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,350
Did she?

67
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,800
- Agent hightower,hi.
- Morning.

68
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,040
You two know marc odenthal
from the d.a.'s office?

69
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,470
Sure.

70
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:55,550
We're gonna talk with
the district attorney.

71
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,360
What can you tell me about kelly's case?

72
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,800
We're looking at anybody who had
access to the house Cbs From work,

73
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,800
the neighborhood,the
local dog park,anywhere.

74
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,070
Husband?

75
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,470
Flower was too upset to talk last
night.Jane and i are heading over there now.

76
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,020
And we've got a list of past defendants.

77
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,910
At least four have expressed
written or verbal threats.

78
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,850
The d.a.told me to give you this.

79
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:13,480
It includes her current cases.

80
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,260
Hang on.Hank draber.The smuggler?

81
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,340
Smuggling drugs,conspiracy to murder.

82
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,250
We haven't been able to
lay a glove on 'em before.

83
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,500
Draber's trial was
supposed to start next week.

84
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,850
I just got judge hildred
to grant a continuance.

85
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,560
It's gonna take me three
months just to learn the file.

86
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,980
Go.Take van pelt.

87
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,810
<i>****</i>

88
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:59,200
All right.There he is.Mr.Draber!

89
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,800
What do you want?

90
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,720
So how are you getting
along lately?Any problems?

91
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:27,080
You... My wife is dead,and
you're wasting your time on me?

92
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:31,680
Mr.Flower,I knew your wife.

93
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,820
Now we're gonna find out who
did this,even if it's you.

94
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,940
You understand?

95
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,580
So how were you two getting along?

96
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,170
We loved each other.

97
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,850
Everything was good.

98
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,880
How was the remodel?That
can be stressful.

99
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,830
Things were good.

100
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,280
But that day,we fought.

101
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:57,090
That's why i went to the
movies-- Over her hours.

102
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:01,190
It... It was just so stupid.

103
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,540
She was so stressed over
that draber case,you know?

104
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:08,750
She called it her "career-maker."
That's what she said-- "career-maker."

105
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:11,190
So you argued.Did it turn physical?

106
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,700
No.I loved her.

107
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,340
I would never do
anything like that.Never.

108
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:25,740
Mr.Flower?I got the tarp on the roof In
case it rains before you want me back.

109
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:29,530
Didn't mean to interrupt.I'll
get out of your hair now.

110
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,050
Thank you.That's our
contractor cale sylvan.He's,uh--

111
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,730
- patrick jane.How you doing?
- Good.

112
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:43,050
You're standing in the...
Can i ask yoru a question?

113
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,390
Uh,would you recommend A flash hot
water heater over a regular one?

114
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,610
I mean,i was leaning towards
flash,But they're very expensive.

115
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:53,880
Well,you know,flash will pay for
itself in energy savings Pretty quick,

116
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,170
but it depends on consumption.

117
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,570
Of course.That's a very good point.

118
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,350
Um,do you have a card?

119
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:02,220
- Sure.
- Great.

120
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,890
- I'll maybe give you a call.
- Great.

121
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,490
Well,thanks for your time,mr.Flower.

122
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,790
Thank you.

123
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:18,280
Cale sylvan is a dangerous
psychopath,And he killed kelly flower.

124
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,600
How's that?

125
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,520
- He had access,and he looked evil.
- And...

126
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:24,340
When i told him he was standing
in her blood,What was his reaction?

127
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,260
Not horror.Not embarrassment.

128
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:28,730
No emotion at all.All
right.I'll run him.

129
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:30,950
Excellent.Having prints might help,no?

130
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,700
You know,you guys should be more
careful.You almost got yourselves shot.

131
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,110
It's a good thing you look like cops.

132
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:40,150
We could take you in,but you'll lawyer
up,And we'll all waste a lot of time.

133
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:42,630
But here we can have a
nice conversation,right?

134
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,880
Yeah.That sounds reasonable.

135
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,170
Fine.

136
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,440
Kelly flower was all set to fry your ass
in court.You were looking at 20 years,easy.

137
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,890
Now the trial's been
postponed who knows how long.

138
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,850
That gives you motive for her murder.

139
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,850
That one's a winner.I know it is.

140
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,190
Here you go.You like the lotto,huh?

141
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:05,280
- None of your business.
- Mom.come on.

142
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,640
You have pretty hair.

143
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,500
My mom's a little senile.

144
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:13,000
Now who'd take care of your mother
If kelly flower put you in jail?

145
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:17,520
You know,killing a prosecutor is--is
almost as bad As killing a cop,right?

146
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,590
It's not something i want
to get my hands dirty with.

147
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,320
I got enough problems
as it is.Right,mom?

148
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,010
Close your mouth,muffin.

149
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,290
Well,jane's right.

150
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,930
Sylvan is a killer.

151
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,640
You know,it feels good to be right.

152
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:41,370
Prints brought up these
i.d.s.We got carl sennett,

153
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,870
A witness in an accidental
drowning in arizona,

154
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:47,950
Cory sampson,who lived next door
To a hit-and-run victim in seattle,

155
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:52,200
And chad sewell,wanted for questioning
About the murder of his boss,

156
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,150
a bank executive in reno.

157
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:57,020
We have four other deaths that
sylvan's linked to In some other way.

158
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,510
He's not just a
killer.He's a serial killer.

159
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,610
Well,saddle up.Lock and load.Do
what you do.Go--go bring him in.

160
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:04,650
We can't.

161
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,540
- Nope.
- What?

162
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:09,170
All we have is that cale sylvan
liked to change his name--

163
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,810
Not illegal--and that
bad luck followed him.

164
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,550
We don't even have enough
for a search warrant.

165
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,700
He'll kill again.You--
you know what he is,lisbon.

166
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,500
Knowing isn't proving.

167
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:21,260
Rigsby,have cho set up On sylvan's
house 24-hour surveillance.

168
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:23,970
If he shows up,have cho follow
him.Maybe we'll get lucky.

169
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,010
Okay.

170
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:27,090
This--this
is ridiculous.

171
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:29,530
- I... I know.
- I'm gonna go with cho.

172
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,250
Go.

173
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,210
Sylvan's smart enough
to know we'll be here.

174
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,300
He won't be coming back.

175
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,420
It's a waste of time.

176
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,500
What are you reading there,cho?

177
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,920
"wuthering heights."

178
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,610
Well,i'm gonna take a stroll.

179
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:59,520
Let me know how it ends.

180
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,540
Not well.

181
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:06,750
Cho said jane ditched him at
sylvan's.Have you seen him?

182
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,500
Nope.There's something hinky here,boss.

183
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:13,020
These are photos of some of
the victims linked to sylvan.

184
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,030
Different ages,sexes,races.

185
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,820
Exactly.A serial killer almost
always hunts the same kind of prey.

186
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,130
This doesn't make sense
as a serial killer's m.o.

187
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,490
it does when you look
at sylvan's financials.

188
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,130
I tracked bank records for
all the i.d.s we could find.

189
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,610
Sylvan received substantial payments
Just before and just after each death.

190
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,240
He kills for money?He's a hit man?

191
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,860
A psychopath who made money
from his hobby.It's outstanding.

192
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,590
You do something you love.You never
have to work a day in your life.

193
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,130
Where the hell have you been?

194
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:42,650
Me?Oh,i've been around.

195
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:45,680
I found a web site registered
to one of his old identies.

196
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:48,220
It says to "call mr.Black
for odd josbs of any sort."

197
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,290
Well,i guess we should give him a call.

198
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:56,190
Grace,do you happen to have any
photographs Of,uh,you know,ex-boyfriends?

199
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,910
I want you to kill him.

200
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:04,000
How much do you charge?

201
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:08,150
Ask him again,grace.You're a busy
lady.You don't have all night.

202
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:12,860
You gonna answer me or not?I
want the bastard dead--soon.

203
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:15,950
- She's convincing.
- Trying to work here.

204
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,590
Okay.

205
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,850
I charge $50,000.

206
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,630
And what you're asking is pretty easy.

207
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:27,750
I mean,you just gotta have To
stop thinking of him as a person.

208
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,770
The rest is just a physics
problem--gravity,force,torque.

209
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:35,000
Ask for proof of what he does.

210
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:38,530
Torque is well and good,But i
need to know that you're for real.

211
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,470
See,maybe you're a hitter.

212
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:44,070
Maybe you're a cop.

213
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,720
- Long shot.
- Trying to work here.

214
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,960
Let me show you somethin'.

215
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,200
How's that?

216
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,970
- Let's move.
- No,no,no.It's a test.

217
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,730
Grace,listen.Listen very carefully.

218
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,530
Are you a cop?

219
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,640
I'm not a cop.

220
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:09,600
I'm just careful,like you.

221
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,150
I just want to know that
i have the right man.

222
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,390
Besides,don't you want to show me...

223
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:21,790
Besides,Don't you want to show
me,So you can make me afraid?

224
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:26,590
That's what you like,isn't
it-- Seeing the fear?

225
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:31,000
You show me yours,and
i'll show you mine.

226
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,030
I have something to show you then.

227
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,310
Just watch for a second.

228
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,320
<i>Oh,wait.Oh,please!</i>

229
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,510
Look at it.

230
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,860
It's my last job.

231
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:58,120
The client was very happy.

232
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:01,150
Proof.That's proof.Proof.

233
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:04,970
- Are we gonna do business?
- Yes,we are.

234
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:09,410
- Cbi!Drop the knife!
- Don't move!

235
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,310
- Hands on your head!
- Drop the knife now!

236
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,520
Don't move!On your knees!

237
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,120
Cale sylvan,you're under arrest
for the murder of kelly flower.

238
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:21,470
Hands on your head!

239
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,910
Jane,you can come out.

240
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,640
okay.

241
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:27,330
How'd you know he had proof?

242
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:30,380
Well,he's a narcissist.Needs
affirmation,trophies.

243
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,990
Who paid you to kill kelly?

244
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,550
Tell 'em.You'll feel better.

245
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,090
I would like to talk to my lawyer.

246
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,320
And i'll see you clowns in court.

247
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:45,240
<i>****</i>

248
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,170
Catching killers i enjoy,But being
reminded that we're just a cog In a petty,

249
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:52,060
fascist machine,that
is a little depressing.

250
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,140
Crime-fighting is hard.Suck it up.

251
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,190
If you weren't on the witness list,

252
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:58,140
I wouldn't even let you In the
same time zone as judge dread.

253
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:01,780
"judge dread"--can't possibly
be as much fun as it sounds.

254
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:09,230
Oh,please!Please!What do you want?

255
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:12,600
Oh,god!Oh,god,don't hurt me!

256
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:15,310
Oh,god!Oh,god,don't!

257
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:18,100
Please!Please!

258
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,580
Your honor,i object.

259
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,060
This video is inflammatory
and prejudicial.

260
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:26,450
Although we'll stipulate to the
fact That kelly flower was murdered,

261
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,900
we reserve our right to deny That there is
probable cause my client committed said murder.

262
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,480
And we also object to the
chain of custody for this video.

263
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,420
Is that even a sentence?

264
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,610
Quiet in the gallery!

265
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,830
You say another word,and
you'll regret it.

266
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:45,000
Well,i'm...i'm sorry,your honor,but this woman
Is spouting nothing but ludicrous pettifoggery,

267
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,050
And,uh,i'm a little hungry.

268
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:49,110
Your honor,if you'll let
me down,i can handle him.

269
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,670
Mr.Jane-- that is
your name,correct?

270
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,850
That's correct.Patrick jane.

271
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:56,320
Well,this court hereby fines you $1,000.

272
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:00,080
make it $2,000,And let me tell
this,uh,tiresome woman to move it along.

273
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:02,750
- $2,000 then.
- Okay.

274
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:06,230
Counselor,you heard
the man.Move it along.

275
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,650
So,agent lisbon,Let's
get back to this video.

276
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,380
That night was the first
time you'd ever seen it?

277
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,210
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

278
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,900
Objection.Asked and answered.

279
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,200
I'll move on,your honor.

280
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,630
So you never entered Mr.Sylvan's
apartment and looked at the video

281
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,660
On his computer or instructed
anyone else to do so?

282
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,820
No.

283
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:30,020
Well,then i need you to
answer a puzzling question.

284
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,210
Your honor,i would like to enter this
into evidence As defense exhibit one.

285
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,910
I got this mug from mr.Sylvan's sink.

286
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,530
But he didn't put it there.

287
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,820
So...

288
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:52,010
So tell me,how is it that this mug
Has mr.Jane's fingerprints on it?

289
00:15:54,070 --> 00:16:00,650
Agent lisbon,Did your consultant break
into mr.Sylvan's home Without a warrant?

290
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,950
No.No,of course not.

291
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:06,120
Your honor,may i have a moment
to confer with agent lisbon?

292
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,930
You make it quick.This
is getting interesting.

293
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,820
Bailiff.

294
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,750
That's how you knew sylvan had
proof.You'd already seen it.

295
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,360
i have no idea what
you're talking about.

296
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,880
Tell us what happenednow.

297
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,140
I was with cho.We were
staking out sylvan's place.

298
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:27,700
I decided i wanted to take a walk.

299
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,820
I happened upon sylvan's door,unlocked.

300
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:36,970
And like any concerned
citizen,I went in to look around

301
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:40,130
And checked that the
place hadn't been robbed.

302
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:47,690
Then i left.

303
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,670
- That's it.
- Oh,crap.

304
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:53,010
What's the story,mr.Odenthal?

305
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:57,660
Your honor... Mr.Jane did
enter mr.Sylvan's residence,

306
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,080
But only because he feared
there was an intruder inside.

307
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,150
You mean one besides himself?

308
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:04,910
I-it's not like i took
anything,your honor.

309
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:09,970
Your honor,what mr.Jane is trying to
say Is that he's not a state agent.

310
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:11,740
He's a private consultant.

311
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,880
Therefore,there's no
fourth amendment violation.

312
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:19,610
Mr.Jane is a charlatan who has made a mockery
Of our legal system on numerous occasions.

313
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:22,360
In fact,a few months ago
he refused to take a woman

314
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:25,640
To the hospital for poisoning
until she confessed to a murder.

315
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:29,380
She was not poisoned in the first
place,And it was just a very clever ruse--

316
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:33,030
- quiet,mr.Jane.
- For what it's worth.

317
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:35,500
You should be ashamed
of yourself anyway.

318
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,990
You,too,agent lisbon.You're the law.

319
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:45,480
I hold mr.Jane's search to be illegal,And any
evidence discovered then or during the sting

320
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:48,900
Is hereby excluded as
fruit of the poisonous tree.

321
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,990
The
video--out.

322
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:55,050
Any statements made by the
defendant To agent van pelt--out.

323
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,310
Your honor,i object.Your
anger is clouding your--

324
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:05,740
Mr.Odenthal,do you have any evidence of any
kind That yourconsultant hasn't crapped all over?

325
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,860
No,your honor.

326
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:14,440
Well,thenthe people v.Sylvan Is
hereby dismissed for lack of evidence.

327
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:17,200
Mr.Sylvan,you're free to go.

328
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,450
This is ridiculous,your honor.

329
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,410
This is wrong!

330
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,280
This don't make no sense!

331
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:26,330
I'll be seeingyou.

332
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,370
He killed my wife!

333
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,450
How can he go free?

334
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,500
Bailiff,bring in the next case.

335
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,970
I had a confession.I had
video.I had an airtight case.

336
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,920
And it's all out.

337
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,600
How could you break into his place?

338
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,820
Easy.The lock on the
back door was very flimsy.

339
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:54,380
Marc,i
apologize.I do.I--

340
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,860
also,i didn't think i'd be found out.

341
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:58,960
I mean,how was i to know they were
going to dust Formyfingerprints?

342
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,600
You let a killer back on the streets.

343
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:02,220
Actually,i got the
killer off the streets.

344
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,040
Keeping him off the
streets-- your job.

345
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,700
You're blaming me?

346
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,820
I'm not the one who got
the murder weapon tossed.

347
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:10,230
Court is theater.Whatever
side has the best liar wins.

348
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,770
Usually that's you,but
today she was better.

349
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,660
You're an arrogant little bastard.

350
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:15,820
Whoa,easy with the steel,brother.

351
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:18,600
Oh,relax.It's not loaded.

352
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,700
Look,marc,there is no
double jeopardy here.

353
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:23,600
We can still take this to trial.

354
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,450
I will find new evidence.I promise.

355
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,300
You're a menace.

356
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:31,990
When i'm d.a.,you'll never
work with this office again.

357
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:34,170
- So ambitious.
- Not your call,marc.

358
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,450
- Not then,not now.
- You're defending him?

359
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:39,120
- Thank you,lisbon.
- Shut up,jane.

360
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,210
I thought you two trusted each other.

361
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,870
- So did i.
- We do.

362
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,870
I--we
have trust.

363
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,440
I-i didn't tell her
because i didn't want her

364
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:51,620
To be complicit and then
have to lie about it later.

365
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:55,730
Some partnership you got going on here.

366
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:01,340
I'll have to send you home while the
professional standards unit Does its thing--

367
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,040
five days at least.

368
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,630
It's not her fault.

369
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:07,390
That will be the p.s.u.'s
determination,no doubt.

370
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,270
This is just the situation
we talked about,patrick.

371
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:17,430
Agent lisbon is responsible fov3r 11 5the
actions of her team members,Including you.

372
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,530
Yes,ma'am.

373
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,860
- Is that all?
- Yes.

374
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,780
Look,lisbon,i'm so sorry.I really am.

375
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,590
Jane.

376
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,670
Lisbon needs some time off.

377
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:44,070
A few days off will do her good.

378
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,980
Nice talking with you.

379
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,850
Rigsby,go back through
sylvan's financials.

380
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,770
Van pelt,take another look at
kelly's video of her murder.

381
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:06,020
See if we missed anything.

382
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:10,400
Hey,we'll serve up sylvan As
your welcome back present,okay?

383
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,690
It's a little chilly in here.

384
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,380
Do you want to go get a coffee?

385
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,950
Oh,come on.Look at the bright side.You get
five days off.You get five days off from me.

386
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,820
Cho,you're in charge.He's
your problem now.

387
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:32,750
That's good.Cho's a big boy.He
knows how to look after me.

388
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:37,170
You want to get a coffee?

389
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:41,730
Did you bring a book?

390
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,550
Could be a bit of a wait.

391
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,290
What are we doing here?

392
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:47,270
You're still mad with me
about lisbon's suspension.

393
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,570
Yeah.It's your fault.

394
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:56,210
You know,Sometimes in order to catch
these risk takers,We have to take risks.

395
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,500
There can be fallout.

396
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:59,590
Tell me what's going
on or i'm outta here.

397
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,060
Okay.

398
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:03,150
I looked in sylvan's kitchen cabinets.

399
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,610
Not much of a tea selection.

400
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,010
He's a coffee geek-- Drinks
only the best,fresh-roast coffee.

401
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:13,060
And the best fresh-roasted coffee In sylvan's
neighborhood... Is in this place here.

402
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,980
That's kind of thin.

403
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:22,310
Yeah,but i'm 100% confident
that it... Thank goodness.

404
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:26,570
Look,the judge warned us not to
talk To sylvan without his lawyer.

405
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:27,900
Talk?

406
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:31,250
This is two guys bumping into
each other In the coffee line.

407
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,700
Jane.

408
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,660
Cale?

409
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:48,190
That's a funny coincidence.

410
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,550
I told you i'd be seeing you.

411
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:56,540
Well,you look well,i gotta say.

412
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:01,030
You're in a very relaxed state.

413
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:06,610
Now confess that you killed kelly
flower,And a huge burden will be lifted.

414
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,370
Funny guy.

415
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,240
Sense of humor.That's great.

416
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,160
Well,maybe i did something wrong.

417
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,390
Sorry to,uh,bother you.

418
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,530
Accidents happen.

419
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,750
Hypnosis.Great plan.

420
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:34,380
No,that would be
silly.Hypnosis is illegal.

421
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:41,160
That was a misdirect so that i could
search his jacket pockets And find...this.

422
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,890
A button,fluff and some sand?

423
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:54,200
Yeah.It's a little anticlimactic.

424
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,190
Um,do you have an evidence baggie?

425
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:02,990
You're walking home.

426
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,500
Or i could just carry it.

427
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:08,670
So sylvan's financials are
clean.There's just one thing i don't get.

428
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,680
The end of every month,He
withdraws just over 2 grand in cash.

429
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,860
He has no family,no girlfriend.

430
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,190
Sounds like rent.

431
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,220
His apartment's only $900,and
he writes a check for that.

432
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,370
No,not his
apartment-- his home.

433
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:23,940
A place to store his tools,process
his victims,Keep his trophies.

434
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,280
A murder house.

435
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,370
And if he's paying cash,it's a fair bet
The name cale sylvan won't be on the lease.

436
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,980
The place could be anywhere.

437
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,670
Maybe i can narrow it
a little.Look at this.

438
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,550
This is from the sylvan murder video.

439
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:40,330
The bag he's holding--
it's from abs gym.

440
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,210
We show his picture around the gym.Maybe
we find someone who knows his other address.

441
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:46,090
There's a dozen abs gyms around
here.It'll take days to canvass 'em.

442
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:47,930
I'll start with the ones by the river.

443
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,220
The sand jane found In sylvan's
pockets-- it's river sand,not ocean sand.

444
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,480
- How'd you know?
- We're in sacramento.

445
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,860
We got a river,not an ocean.

446
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:56,110
There's only one abs gym
near the river--on dos robles.

447
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:58,030
On my way.

448
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,810
If you get an address,go straight to
judge hildred And get a search warrant.

449
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,160
We'll take down sylvan today.

450
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,970
Aw,shut up.

451
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:21,210
You shouldn't have embezzled
all that money,you big baby.

452
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,320
Time to go to work.

453
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:43,660
I don't think you're
gonna want to look at this.

454
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,780
What was that?

455
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:49,500
Freeze!Freeze!

456
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:51,640
Let me see your hands!Let
me see your hands!

457
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:01,430
Get your hands off of me!

458
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,030
Get your hands off me!

459
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,730
- Hook him up.
- It's not me.

460
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,870
I hope you brought more people.

461
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,920
Cheating son of a bitch.

462
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:15,050
You're okay.You're safe now.

463
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,650
You got it?There we go.

464
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,930
I sent the victim to the hospital.

465
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:24,330
He'll be okay... After three
or four years of therapy.

466
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:25,450
Good.

467
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:28,280
Yeah,that look's not so scary
when you're in handcuffs,buddy.

468
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:33,140
Either you tell us who hired you Or you're
looking at a slam-dunk death penalty.

469
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:37,050
Maybe we can come to
some kind of arrangement.

470
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,000
Cho,get down!

471
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,650
10-33.shots fired.

472
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:44,570
Man down.We need paramedics now.

473
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,970
G.s.w.to the chest.

474
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:48,210
Shot came from the north of
location.North of location.

475
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:50,190
Let's get a bird in here now.

476
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,640
The son of a bitch is dead.

477
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,410
Call in another team for
the back of the house.

478
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,320
Thanks.

479
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:12,740
That's eight bodies so far,and that's just
the ones Sylvan's clients didn't want found.

480
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:15,100
They're gonna be clearing
Missing persons cases for a month.

481
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,200
- Any luck on the shooter?
- Not much.

482
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:20,420
Kill shot came from that
hillside,Over two football fields away.

483
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,900
That's a tough shot.

484
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,920
So i guess whoever employed sylvan Hired
a second shooter to cover his tracks.

485
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:28,520
The thing is,how did that client know
That sylvan had become a liability?

486
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:30,540
That's a good question.

487
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,110
Where's jane?

488
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:39,330
This better be good.I was
catching up on my tivo.

489
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:42,580
Liar.You were reading.But what?

490
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:44,460
Progress reports?

491
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,820
No.

492
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,230
Whatever.

493
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:49,060
This is gonna be a lot of fun.

494
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,420
I'm going into the drabers' lair.

495
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:54,790
It's not a lair,it's an
office,and no,you're not.

496
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,440
Oh,yes,i am.

497
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:58,810
They seem kind of scary.You wouldn't
want me to get hurt,would you?

498
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,920
Don't bet on it.W-why the drabers?

499
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,720
A hunch.

500
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,070
They're key in this somehow.

501
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,390
You think they hired sylvan?

502
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,910
Well,sylvan looked the part.

503
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,760
Why the hell didn't you call cho?

504
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,330
Well,you were closer.

505
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:12,210
Call cho.I'm not even armed.

506
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,380
More lies.

507
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:15,680
You have at least two guns in that car.

508
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,350
Three?Oh,my.

509
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:23,500
You're the poster girl for the n.r.a.

510
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,360
I'm telling you,I've got nothing
to do with the prosecutor dying.

511
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:29,920
And the sylvan guy-- never heard
of him Before i saw him on the news.

512
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,680
Hello.Hi!

513
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,660
Gonna win big.

514
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,950
Gonna buy a washing machine.

515
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:42,130
She's a treasure.

516
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:45,660
You want to leave her alone?She's
a little soft in the head,okay?

517
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,620
You know,hank,as you were
talking to lisbon here,

518
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,250
I couldn't help but notice you
kept looking at your mother,

519
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,010
As if you were checking
for her approval.

520
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,370
I mean,most tough guys are scared of
their mothers,But,hank,you were quaking.

521
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,420
Your friend's crazier than my mom.

522
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,860
Digging those nails.

523
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,290
Plucked eyebrows,coiffed hair.

524
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,890
Did you do the,uh,makeover,hank?

525
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,640
No,didn't think so.

526
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:10,350
Time for my stories,hanky.

527
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,460
Okay,hanky.

528
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:14,250
You are upsetting
her,okay?So leave her alone.

529
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:16,120
Easy.

530
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,130
This is brilliant.

531
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:23,030
Lisbon,this is brilliant.

532
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:26,460
You--you are
a treasure.

533
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:29,220
You're running this whole
operation,aren't you?

534
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,870
Hank's just a figurehead
to take the heat.

535
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:35,700
Tell me i'm right.You
know,ishould havechecked the shoes.

536
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:42,140
Damn it,hank.

537
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:44,790
I told you about looking at me,didn't i?

538
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:48,780
You think you're so damn clever.

539
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:55,320
Well,clever is as clever does,And
you've just made a very stupid move.

540
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,430
Boys!

541
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,600
Oh,dear.

542
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,650
How clever are you now exactly?

543
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:07,580
We're cops.Just be cool.

544
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:10,610
Put the weapons down now.

545
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:14,170
You put your gun down,miss
lisbon,and you can live.

546
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:19,890
Come on.Get in.

547
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:26,220
I was right about annabelle anyway.

548
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:28,670
Congratulations.

549
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,170
So we're good,right?

550
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:45,420
You're not gonna put a hit out on me?

551
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:47,520
You've moved on.

552
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,210
That's good.

553
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,760
I've moved on,too.

554
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,120
Well,i'm glad.That's a relief.

555
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,640
You guys heard from jane?

556
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:56,590
- No.
- No.

557
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:01,920
Hello?!Anybody?!Hello?!

558
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,280
I can't really see anything.

559
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:13,550
There's kind of a draft right
here,though,if you just... Just there.

560
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:15,700
No food,no water.

561
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:17,600
This is not good.

562
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:23,870
Well,i suppose we should draw
straws To see who eats who first.

563
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:27,690
Yeah,right.Draw straws
with a professional cheat.

564
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:30,860
Why so grumpy?It's not
like we're gonna die here.

565
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:33,240
The drabers don't want us dead.

566
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:36,010
Come here and get a
little bit of this breeze.

567
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:38,060
It'll cheer you up.Come here.

568
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:43,000
It's not quite as nice as a
river breeze,But it's not bad.

569
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,970
You feeling that?Good.

570
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:49,930
River breeze.

571
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:52,190
Wait a minute.

572
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:54,010
I live nowhere near the docks.

573
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:55,500
Well,that's good.It's
a terrible neighborhood.

574
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,970
You said you called me
because i was closer,

575
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,640
But the h.q.is only 15
minutes from the docks.

576
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:04,040
I'm--i'm just--i'm bad with
distances,always have been.

577
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,360
Patrick jane,you were trying to help me.

578
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:10,370
You were.

579
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:15,000
You thought if i made a big
bust,The p.s.u.would get off my back.

580
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:22,750
You know i'm always gonna save
you,lisbon,Whether you like it or not.

581
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,550
I don't need to be saved.

582
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:29,690
I knew this would end a disaster
the day i signed on with you.

583
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:33,800
One day i'm gonna get fired because
of you.That's just the way it is.

584
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:38,020
Right.Well,some people might ask why
you signed on with me In the first place.

585
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,950
We catch a lot of bad guys.

586
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:42,130
Most days,that's enough.

587
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,290
- Also,i...
- I think i hear something.

588
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,380
- Someone out there.
- Where?

589
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,070
- Hello!
- Hello?

590
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,750
- Over here!
- In here!

591
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,870
Around the
front.The--the big latch.

592
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:53,420
I told you i would save you,lisbon.

593
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,860
Sac p.d.found jane's car
at the docks.Lisbon's,too.

594
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:21,800
- Crap.
- No sign of them or the drabers.

595
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,470
Call sac p.d.,i.c.e.and the coast guard.

596
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:25,940
Have them search every vehicle...
Warehouse and boat the drabers own.

597
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,910
Van pelt.Slow down.

598
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:28,960
Agent rigsby.

599
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:32,240
Um,s?Uno--uno
momento,por favor.

600
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:35,090
- Can you?
- I'll call you back.

601
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:36,840
It's the federales,i think.

602
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:39,380
Something about jane and a goat?

603
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:46,900
Louise willett robbed The very people
she was supposed to be taking care of,

604
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,590
And she spent
that money--

605
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:52,490
ipso facto,ad nauseam.Sorry,odenthal.I
need to borrow your judge for a second.

606
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:55,070
Uh,mr.Jane,we are in session.

607
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:58,940
Yes,we would have come earlier,But,uh,we
had quite a long walk getting here.

608
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,020
It won't take a second.

609
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:03,050
We just need One of your fancy
arrest/warrant thingies for annabelle draber.

610
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,490
- She'll give you the details.
- Jane,get out of here.

611
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,320
Mr.Jane,there are no
phones in my courtroom.

612
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,860
I'm very sorry.Just a minute,cho.

613
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,460
- I'm kinda busy.
- That's $1,000,mr.Jane.

614
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:15,390
Sure.Uh,listen,i'm kinda In the middle

00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:25,350

- $5,000.

619
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:27,280
you're not costing me another
case.Give me that phone.

620
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,270
No.Get your own.

621
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,800
Your
honor--battery?

622
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:36,170
Bailiffs,would you
arrest this man,please?

623
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,930
Lisbon,this... Hang on,cho.

624
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:42,260
I'm on suspension.No badge,no authority.

625
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:51,780
Oh,thanks for bailing me out.

626
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:54,010
Lisbon wasn't answering
her phone for some reason.

627
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,110
The judge is really
pissed,so is odenthal.

628
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,750
They want to make an example.

629
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:00,420
It's not just contempt of
court,jane.It's battery.

630
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,860
Battery against a peace officer.

631
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:06,500
Penal code section 242
"et seq."I love the latin.

632
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:08,870
You know there's 30
kinds of battery charges?

633
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,460
Yes.

634
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:12,850
This stuff is fascinating.

635
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,740
You know,i could be my own lawyer.

636
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:17,520
You're gonna represent yourself?

637
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,530
You represent yourself,you're an idiot.

638
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:23,240
Uh,it's actually "he who is his
own lawyer has a fool for a client."

639
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:25,660
It's much catchier.

640
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,240
Could be fun,cho.

641
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:37,450
This may be a,um,A
somewhat informal hearing,

642
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:43,150
But you still must respect this court,Or
you will go directly back to jail.

643
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:46,130
- Do you read me?
- Yeah,you bet,your honor.

644
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:49,250
Mr.Jane asked me to come.

645
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:50,550
Do you know why?

646
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,080
I have no idea.

647
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,720
Let's get right to it,mr.Jane.

648
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,580
Is it true that yesterday,

649
00:35:55,610 --> 00:36:00,740
You tweaked the assistant district
attorney's nose In this very room?

650
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,960
Speaking of yourself in
the third person,marc,

651
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:08,230
Y-you gotta admit,sounds
a little silly.

652
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:10,790
Yes,i tweaked your nose.

653
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:13,050
Your honor,we're done
here.Mr.Jane admits the crime.

654
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:15,980
But in my defense,you
were being very annoying.

655
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:17,680
Mr.Jane,you're out of order.

656
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,560
You're out of order.You're out of order.

657
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,090
This whole trial's out of order!

658
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:27,610
Oh,come on.You gotta admit,you
walked right into that one.

659
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,580
Okay.

660
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,720
All right,my turn to question you guys.

661
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:38,940
Yes.Wait."you guys"?Plural?

662
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:40,700
Well,you're both witnesses.

663
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:44,120
Uh... When i'm cross-examing myself,

664
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,430
Do--do i have to stand down
there and ask the questions

665
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,430
And run back up here and answer them?

666
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:50,640
Mr.Jane,you stay put.

667
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,800
Okay.

668
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:54,100
Mr.Odenthal,you take a deep breath.

669
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:57,830
Pro perdefendants are given
a certain amount of latitude.

670
00:36:57,870 --> 00:37:00,680
You know that.God help us all.

671
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,740
Judge hildred,are you now or have you
ever been A member of the communist party?

672
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:06,170
What?No!

673
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:08,620
Mr.Odenthal,do you own a gun?

674
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:10,310
- Wait.What?
- Are you a good shot?

675
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:13,990
Don't answer that.How about you,your
honor?You any good with a gun?

676
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:17,770
The person that killed cale sylvan,They
estimated,was more than 200 yards away.

677
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:19,430
That is a great shot.

678
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:22,290
It's why we assume there
was a second hit man.

679
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:24,370
Mr.Jane,please sit down.

680
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,310
Were you having an
affair with kelly flower?

681
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,080
No.

682
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,610
But isn't it true that you delight
In killing small furry animals?

683
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:32,810
You're a hunter.

684
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,410
This is irrelevant.

685
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:35,900
This is how we solve a murder.

686
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,820
Are you saying you don't
want me to solve a murder?

687
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,300
Of course i do.

688
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,890
Then answer the question,sir.

689
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:44,810
Answer it,or tell me why you won't.

690
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:47,410
I go duck hunting every season.

691
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,570
And what kind of gun do you use
to kill these defenseless ducks?

692
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:54,210
A 10-gauge shotgun.

693
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,140
And would you consider
yourself a very good marksman?

694
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:01,170
Uh,last season i bagged
a mallard at,uh,60 yards.

695
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,060
Oh,that's not
bad.Not--not bad at all.

696
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:08,310
10-gauge,3-inch shell.3 inches
of hell.3 inches of death.

697
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:10,660
3 1/2.

698
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:16,600
I mean,i think.Right?

699
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,210
So you must be a hunter,too.

700
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,760
No.I...

701
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:21,810
Then what's that dead
beast in your office,marc?

702
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:23,870
What is that?Did you just
get it off craigslist?

703
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:28,310
Well,i,uh,I mean,yes,i used
to hunt,just not anymore.

704
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:31,500
But you still know your
way around a gun,don't you?

705
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,260
Oh,relax.

706
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,480
It's not loaded.

707
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:39,820
You own your own rifle,don't you?

708
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:45,190
You heard that the judge had issued
a warrant For sylvan's murder house,

709
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:49,860
And you knew that you had to
silence sylvan before he talked.

710
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,260
Cho,get down!

711
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:00,970
You had to silence him Before
he named you as his client--

712
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:03,660
The client who hired
him to kill kelly flower.

713
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:05,710
Your honor,this is
completely ridiculous.

714
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:07,010
So prove it.

715
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:09,730
Let us search your house.We
don't find a gun,i'll apologize.

716
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:13,810
Let him do the search,marc.

717
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,740
No.

718
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:16,920
No?

719
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:18,590
No.

720
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,530
I don't have to do that.

721
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:22,480
I have rights.

722
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:25,790
And you're obviously
prejudiced against me,judge.

723
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:27,800
And i'm going to take that
up with the chief judge.

724
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,360
In fact,i'm going to do that right now.

725
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:31,210
You should stay put,counselor.

726
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,600
- Bailiff.
- Don't move.

727
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:34,700
Sir,your hands.

728
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:40,870
The gun that killed sylvan-- A remington
700,with scope,from your garage.

729
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:45,390
Oh,and,uh... We got a warrant.

730
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:47,520
You're right.A lot
better with one of these.

731
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:50,230
You're a good prosecutor.You
know what this means.

732
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:53,800
A sniper rifle-- Lying in wait,murder
with special circumstances.

733
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,950
Hello,death penalty.

734
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:58,500
But if you're willing to come
clean about kelly's murder,

735
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,820
The d.a.will take death off the table.

736
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:04,700
That is the last and only offer
you'll get,You miserable sack of crap.

737
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:10,190
I realized the drabers didn't hire sylvan
When they didn't kill lisbon and me.

738
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:11,370
If they don't kill cops,

739
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:14,150
They're certainly not gonna kill
an assistant district attorney.

740
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:16,780
But the drabers were
connected somehow,weren't they?

741
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:19,690
'Cause their case was a career
maker,according to kelly,

742
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,420
And you wanted to be d.a.someday.

743
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:26,480
The draber case would have
made me a lock for d.a.

744
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,490
Oh,yeah.

745
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:30,760
And it should have
been me.I had seniority.

746
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,260
It was mine,and the bitch took it.

747
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,740
So you hired sylvan to kill her.

748
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:40,410
Yes.

749
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,200
And when sylvan was arrested,You
told him you'd fix it,that he'd walk.

750
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,440
As prosecutor,you had that power.

751
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,600
Then you hadsylvantell his
attorney to investigate me.

752
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:53,810
The whole d.a.'s office
knows how you operate.

753
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:56,490
Craziness.

754
00:40:56,750 --> 00:41:00,440
I thought there was a good chance
You'd stepped over some line or other.

755
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,880
Turned out you had.

756
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:04,850
It's all right.He's learned his lesson.

757
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,670
Yeah,i have.

758
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:08,790
I certainly have,lisbon.

759
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:11,440
I won't be stopping for tea again.

760
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:15,580
...and lights out at
9:30,and your sister at 9:00.

761
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:17,090
No.

762
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,690
9:30.

763
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:20,400
I love you.

764
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,170
Bye.

765
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:24,100
You wanted to see us,ma'am?

766
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:26,230
Sit.

767
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:32,520
Before i make any final decisions,I want
to make sure i understand what happened.

768
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:37,020
You disrupted a courtroom,Assaulted
an officer of the court

769
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:41,150
So you could question him And nearly caused
a mistrial in an unrelated felony case.

770
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:42,680
Is that about right?

771
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,730
Yeah,that's pretty accurate.

772
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:48,830
You ignored your suspension,Confronted
a gang of criminals without any backup

773
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:53,150
And then participated In mr.Jane's
disruptions,assault,etcetera?

774
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:55,230
Yes,ma'am.

775
00:41:57,730 --> 00:41:59,530
All right,then.

776
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,710
I'm sorry.I don't understand,ma'am.

777
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:04,130
The cbi just busted a crooked d.a.,

778
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:06,860
Rooted out corruption and solved
the murder of one of our own.

779
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:08,580
Awesome.

780
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:12,080
By the way,I.c.e.picked up the
drabers at the canadian border.

781
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,560
The d.a.announced he'll
try the case himself.

782
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,710
We should have done
that in the first place.

783
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,950
I'll tell the p.s.u.to
terminate your suspension.

784
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:24,200
Welcome back.

785
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,920
Patrick,judge hildred's clerk called.

786
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:33,300
You owe the court $16,000 in fines.

787
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:36,610
He needs a cashier's check.

788
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,210
