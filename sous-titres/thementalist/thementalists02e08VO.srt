1
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:19,935
Rigsby.

2
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:25,733
You got it, boss.

3
00:00:26,983 --> 00:00:28,647
- We're up.
- Lisbon?

4
00:00:30,604 --> 00:00:33,006
She's gonna call here next.
She'll know. Get out.

5
00:00:33,258 --> 00:00:36,692
Grace, wake up.
How is Lisbon gonna know i'm with you?

6
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,920
Right.

7
00:00:42,514 --> 00:00:43,514
Leave it.

8
00:00:46,428 --> 00:00:47,428
Get out.

9
00:00:47,576 --> 00:00:48,576
Get out,

10
00:00:49,908 --> 00:00:51,361
Agent Grace Van Pelt.

11
00:00:52,193 --> 00:00:53,751
Hi, boss. What's up?

12
00:00:57,085 --> 00:00:58,015
All right.

13
00:01:04,128 --> 00:01:06,107
Bosco.
And to what do i owe this pleasure?

14
00:01:06,975 --> 00:01:09,448
<i>- You're up. Where are you at?
- Crime scene. Why?</i>

15
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,460
- Coffee run? Usual for you, boss?
- Tall drip, black.

16
00:01:12,965 --> 00:01:14,058
We need to talk.

17
00:01:14,928 --> 00:01:17,435
- About what?
- Come see me when you get back.

18
00:01:18,232 --> 00:01:19,756
Okay. Look forward to it.

19
00:01:21,724 --> 00:01:24,139
Okay, boys,
did one of you see Hicks?

20
00:01:25,005 --> 00:01:27,513
Morning. Well, almost morning.

21
00:01:27,993 --> 00:01:29,435
Morning, everyone.

22
00:01:29,804 --> 00:01:31,526
We got a caucasian male

23
00:01:31,796 --> 00:01:33,437
50s, gunshot to the head.

24
00:01:33,589 --> 00:01:36,706
And tastefully garnished
with an explosion of yellow roses.

25
00:01:36,858 --> 00:01:39,342
Security guard saw the body,
called sac PD,

26
00:01:39,483 --> 00:01:42,465
but this is a state cemetery,
which is why we're here at,

27
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:44,809
- dark-thirty.
- Swell spot.

28
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:49,567
Check out the stippling.
Looks like he was shot at close range.

29
00:01:50,664 --> 00:01:53,675
And fibers in the wound indicate
clothes were removed postmortem.

30
00:01:56,446 --> 00:01:57,717
You smell nice.

31
00:01:58,069 --> 00:01:59,287
Is that Lilac soap?

32
00:02:00,248 --> 00:02:03,330
- Something, Jane?
- Yes, i do. He's naked.

33
00:02:03,715 --> 00:02:06,769
- Let me write that down.
- It makes him look kind of sad,

34
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:07,835
vulnerable.

35
00:02:08,203 --> 00:02:10,578
- A little comic, even.
- Meaning what?

36
00:02:10,703 --> 00:02:13,758
He was posed like this,
not just dumped here. It's a statement.

37
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:16,172
Doctor, the mark on the hand...
Is that a burn?

38
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,305
Looks more like
freezer burn, actually.

39
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:23,531
That explains it.

40
00:02:23,882 --> 00:02:25,519
His liver temp is 45 degrees,

41
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,021
it's only around 58 in here.

42
00:02:29,081 --> 00:02:31,442
Somebody froze his body
in that position, then dumped him.

43
00:02:31,933 --> 00:02:34,069
Could be a signature, maybe

44
00:02:34,336 --> 00:02:35,362
a serial pattern.

45
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,574
We'll talk to Bosco about that,
see if he has any similar incidents.

46
00:02:39,388 --> 00:02:42,369
- Come on. Let's get out of here.
- Let forensics do their thing.

47
00:02:43,888 --> 00:02:45,072
You smell lovely.

48
00:02:45,825 --> 00:02:47,972
What is that? Is that Lilac?

49
00:02:51,054 --> 00:02:51,883
Thanks.

50
00:02:52,008 --> 00:02:53,075
It's pretty.

51
00:03:01,434 --> 00:03:02,700
Morning, Rebecca.

52
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,598
They look good.
One of those for me?

53
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,234
It's all right to like me now.
Your boss and i made up.

54
00:03:07,398 --> 00:03:09,578
That's okay, Rebecca.
I don't like him, either.

55
00:03:09,766 --> 00:03:11,441
She's a liar. She loves me.

56
00:03:11,887 --> 00:03:13,137
In your dreams.

57
00:03:17,923 --> 00:03:18,923
Oh, my god!

58
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,699
Oh, my god, no!

59
00:03:26,826 --> 00:03:27,826
He's gone!

60
00:03:30,105 --> 00:03:31,105
No pulse.

61
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:34,797
- This guy is dead too.
- Jane, some help?

62
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,479
Get over here now!

63
00:03:39,164 --> 00:03:42,039
Press as hard as you can
right there, there.

64
00:03:42,164 --> 00:03:44,265
We've got agents
down on the fifth floor.

65
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,435
Inside the building.

66
00:03:48,951 --> 00:03:50,756
We're in lockdown on my authority.

67
00:03:50,881 --> 00:03:54,608
I have 3 agents down. I need EMTS
and roll SWAT, sac PD. and CHP.

68
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,312
And have them set up a perimeter.
Suspects may still be here.

69
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:58,696
Lock this place down!

70
00:04:01,872 --> 00:04:04,285
5, 6, 7, 8,

71
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:08,270
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15...

72
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,670


73
00:04:18,486 --> 00:04:21,240
24 hours earlier

74
00:04:25,272 --> 00:04:26,348
Hicks? Bosco?

75
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:30,698
Stealing major crimes' food...

76
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:34,023
Violation of penal code
section 484, i believe.

77
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:35,634
It didn't have a name on it.

78
00:04:36,137 --> 00:04:37,509
This one does.

79
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:39,820
It's mine. It's from Cornaro's.

80
00:04:42,025 --> 00:04:43,908
Meatball sub is really
their best thing.

81
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,619
Hope i don't tell Mandy
you went off your diet.

82
00:04:47,144 --> 00:04:48,954
She's in New Hampshire
with her sister.

83
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:50,414
There you are.

84
00:04:50,774 --> 00:04:52,374
Agent hicks, your form 41s.

85
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,753
Boss, the attorney general's office
called about the armenian cartel thing.

86
00:04:56,303 --> 00:04:59,467
And you better hope i don't tell
your wife about you going off your diet.

87
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,643
Breathe, breathe.

88
00:05:10,898 --> 00:05:12,832
Breathe, breathe.

89
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:15,482
Clear!

90
00:05:17,971 --> 00:05:18,971
He's back.

91
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,960
He's bleading out.
No breath sound on the right side.

92
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:25,824
- His pulse is really weak.
- Run IV. Wide open.

93
00:05:26,113 --> 00:05:27,770
We're code three. Let's move,

94
00:05:33,373 --> 00:05:34,373
You okay?

95
00:05:36,619 --> 00:05:37,696
What do we got?

96
00:05:37,821 --> 00:05:40,909
Lockdown's in full effect, buildingwide.
Same with the Capitol and the DOJ.

97
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:43,000
Cho's liaising with the sac PD.

98
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:46,220
They're setting up a 2-block perimeter.
Now nobody gets in or out.

99
00:05:46,668 --> 00:05:49,139
All civilians are sent
to the downstairs lobby for holding.

100
00:05:49,447 --> 00:05:51,851
Swat's on the way up.
We're gonna do a sweep room by room.

101
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,417
Suspects could still be here.

102
00:05:53,542 --> 00:05:55,512
Get with security.
Check the camera footage,

103
00:05:55,637 --> 00:05:58,899
and set up teams to interview guards,
janitors and everyone down in the lobby.

104
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,220
You got it.

105
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,822
He's gone. Go on now.

106
00:06:09,334 --> 00:06:11,302
You may be in shock. Look at me.

107
00:06:12,216 --> 00:06:13,914
There should be three bodies.

108
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,205
There only two.

109
00:06:15,762 --> 00:06:18,210
- Where's agent Hicks?
- I'll get Cho on that.

110
00:06:21,176 --> 00:06:22,840
Maybe we should just wash up first.

111
00:06:58,782 --> 00:07:02,129
- So you saw Hicks this morning?
- I haven't seen him since yesterday.

112
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:04,089
And yesterday,
was he angry or upset?

113
00:07:04,712 --> 00:07:07,220
You think Marlon Hicks
could have done this?

114
00:07:08,606 --> 00:07:10,388
We have to check every angle,
Rebecca.

115
00:07:11,114 --> 00:07:12,169
Let's back up.

116
00:07:13,294 --> 00:07:16,704
When you went out to get coffee,
did you see anything unusual?

117
00:07:16,868 --> 00:07:18,437
Somebody who didn't belong here,?

118
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:22,855
Everything was fine. It was normal.

119
00:07:26,602 --> 00:07:29,219
- God, I'm sorry. I'm not helping.
- It's okay.

120
00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:32,559
I was gone maybe 10 minutes and I...

121
00:07:32,871 --> 00:07:34,328
I didn't see anything weird.

122
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,622
Bosco called the team this morning,
you know why?

123
00:07:36,838 --> 00:07:39,374
Well, I thought that maybe
it was the armenian cartel arrests.

124
00:07:41,138 --> 00:07:42,961
<i>You were that close
to making an arrest?</i>

125
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,234
There was...

126
00:07:46,359 --> 00:07:47,759
a break this week.

127
00:07:47,893 --> 00:07:51,382
An informant came through the boss said.
It was something about...

128
00:07:51,507 --> 00:07:53,257
- a warehouse.
- Lisbon.

129
00:07:54,203 --> 00:07:56,447
Did forensics come up
with an I.D. on the frozen man?

130
00:07:56,572 --> 00:07:59,426
I haven't checked in with them.
It's not really a priority right now.

131
00:08:00,749 --> 00:08:01,749
I guess.

132
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,529
- You were saying?
- Camera four, also nothing.

133
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:08,204
Just an ordinary day.

134
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:10,245
- Weird, huh?
- These guys are like ghosts.

135
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:13,332
No kidding. We cleared the building
top to bottom, there's no sign of them.

136
00:08:13,457 --> 00:08:15,361
B.F.S. are dusting everywhere
for prints,

137
00:08:15,486 --> 00:08:17,129
it'll take days
to go through them all.

138
00:08:17,254 --> 00:08:19,751
Lisbon said I should see
if you needed a hand here.

139
00:08:19,876 --> 00:08:21,545
Jimmy, go to camera 5 now.

140
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,377
Lobby entrance, same time code.

141
00:08:24,816 --> 00:08:26,666
That's Rebecca coming back.

142
00:08:27,014 --> 00:08:29,414
She was gone 9 minutes 30
altogether.

143
00:08:29,866 --> 00:08:32,915
I don't recognize hat guy here. Put him
on the list of people to check out.

144
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,690
OK Jimmy, camera 6...
the garage entrance.

145
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:39,143
Hang on.
Something's screwed up here.

146
00:08:42,213 --> 00:08:44,183
Some files are corrupted
on this data drive.

147
00:08:44,308 --> 00:08:47,312
- That's not possible, our firewalls...
- Have been breached.

148
00:08:47,437 --> 00:08:49,236
Camera 6 and 7.
That's the garage.

149
00:08:50,153 --> 00:08:51,695
They were disabled remotely.

150
00:08:51,903 --> 00:08:53,687
Looks like at least a 30-minute gap.

151
00:08:53,812 --> 00:08:56,451
So, we have no way of knowing
who went in or out via the garage.

152
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:59,719
Jimmy, get somebody from I.T. down here,
figure out what we're dealing with.

153
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,564
I'll tell my boss.

154
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:06,649
Ten minutes.

155
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:08,964
It was all over in 10 minutes.

156
00:09:17,388 --> 00:09:19,788
Got it.
Thanks, Avila, I owe you one.

157
00:09:23,494 --> 00:09:24,644
Agent Lisbon,

158
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:27,904
I spoke to the governor. I told him
that I have my best team on this one.

159
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:30,601
- I know you'll do us proud.
- Thanks, boss.

160
00:09:30,726 --> 00:09:33,721
I reached out to sac P.D. narcotics
about that armenian drug cartel...

161
00:09:33,846 --> 00:09:34,946
In a minute.

162
00:09:38,675 --> 00:09:41,479
- I just got word from the hospital.
- He's not dead?

163
00:09:41,604 --> 00:09:45,204
No, Bosco's in surgery,
but I wanted you to prepare yourself.

164
00:09:45,881 --> 00:09:47,731
His injuries are extensive,

165
00:09:48,356 --> 00:09:49,356
critical.

166
00:09:50,628 --> 00:09:52,558
Teresa, I'm sorry to ask this,

167
00:09:52,683 --> 00:09:55,302
but need to know that you're gonna
be able to go on with this case,

168
00:09:55,831 --> 00:09:58,055
no matter what happens.
If you can't,

169
00:09:58,621 --> 00:10:00,976
just let me know,
and I'll put someone else on point.

170
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,301
Not necessary.

171
00:10:03,442 --> 00:10:06,056
You think Sam Bosco
is gonna let a little lead stop him?

172
00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:07,181
Please.

173
00:10:07,853 --> 00:10:09,353
I hope you're right.

174
00:10:09,781 --> 00:10:10,781
Good luck.

175
00:10:12,473 --> 00:10:13,654
Nothing on Hicks.

176
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,815
I had a uni run by his house,
he's not there, no car in the driveway.

177
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,275
I've got something.
You know that armenian drug cartel

178
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,400
that Bosco was close to nailing?
It's run by a guy named M. Assanian.

179
00:10:23,826 --> 00:10:24,637
Bad guy.

180
00:10:24,762 --> 00:10:27,292
Outside of the mexicans, biggest heroin
distributor on the west coast.

181
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,054
Bosco must've spooked him.
He left the country 3 days ago.

182
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:33,419
So maybe he leaves town to keep himself
clean while his people kill Bosco.

183
00:10:33,544 --> 00:10:35,530
It makes sense.
Kill the team, kill the case.

184
00:10:35,854 --> 00:10:37,548
- It's worth checking out.
- Lisbon,

185
00:10:37,673 --> 00:10:39,983
did we get an I.D. on the man
from the cemetery yet?

186
00:10:40,108 --> 00:10:42,808
- What is with you and this case?
- It's just a feeling.

187
00:10:43,536 --> 00:10:45,028
You think it's connected to Bosco?

188
00:10:45,153 --> 00:10:46,453
- Maybe.
- How?

189
00:10:47,198 --> 00:10:48,298
Hard to say.

190
00:10:49,209 --> 00:10:50,649
Fine. Cho, call it up.

191
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,526
Forensics may have posted something.

192
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:54,486
- Thank you.
- Run down this informant.

193
00:10:54,611 --> 00:10:56,850
See if he's got anything for us.
Lauro in narcotics

194
00:10:56,975 --> 00:10:58,896
- said you could use his name.
- I will do.

195
00:10:59,021 --> 00:11:01,859
Forensics says cemetery guy's
fingerprints belong to a Dr. T. Morning

196
00:11:01,984 --> 00:11:04,384
- age 55, Stockton.
- Towlen Morning.

197
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:11,420
Cho, with me.

198
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:31,667
River Medical Plaza, Stockton CA

199
00:13:11,546 --> 00:13:14,990


200
00:13:18,003 --> 00:13:19,779
How did you know it was Red John?

201
00:13:19,904 --> 00:13:23,604
Towlen Morning was the family doctor
for Janet and Carter Peak.

202
00:13:24,034 --> 00:13:26,218
The Peaks were Red John's
third and fourth victims.

203
00:13:26,343 --> 00:13:28,297
Carter presumed to be the fourth.

204
00:13:28,422 --> 00:13:30,224
They never found his body.

205
00:13:30,437 --> 00:13:31,987
That was 9 years ago.

206
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:34,521
- Why attack the CBI today?
- It's puzzling.

207
00:13:35,476 --> 00:13:39,151
I'm Red John, why do I kill Morning
and Hicks and attack Bosco's team?

208
00:13:39,431 --> 00:13:41,031
Carter and Janet Peak.

209
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,864
Nine years ago.
Carter and Janet Peak. Nine.

210
00:13:44,121 --> 00:13:46,821
Nine years ago,
I'm a lot less experienced.

211
00:13:48,678 --> 00:13:52,040
Something went wrong
with Carter and Janet Peak, a mistake.

212
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,217
Now he fixed it,
but somehow it's come undone.

213
00:13:54,342 --> 00:13:56,992
Hicks came to see the doctor
for a reason.

214
00:13:57,117 --> 00:13:59,696
- He was checking something out.
- And Red John killed him for it,

215
00:13:59,821 --> 00:14:02,090
killed them all.
Except for Bosco, I mean.

216
00:14:03,211 --> 00:14:04,829
Bosco had a lead
in the Red John case.

217
00:14:04,954 --> 00:14:08,472
Cho, go inside. Check the doctor's files
for Carter and Janet Peak...

218
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,390
X-rays, labs, everything.

219
00:14:11,681 --> 00:14:14,181
Why did Bosco
want the medical records?

220
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,080
What did he know?

221
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:18,818
He's in I.C.U.
in a medically induced coma.

222
00:14:18,943 --> 00:14:21,267
- He's not gonna tell us anything.
- I know.

223
00:14:21,392 --> 00:14:22,861
The case files will.

224
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:27,490
Van Pelt, have B.F.S.
search Bosco's office

225
00:14:27,615 --> 00:14:29,993
for any new evidence or notes
in the Red John file.

226
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:33,486
You and Rigsby
start working the secretary, Rebecca.

227
00:14:55,351 --> 00:14:56,351
Hey, boss.

228
00:14:57,443 --> 00:14:58,621
Nothing from Rebecca.

229
00:14:58,746 --> 00:15:01,608
The B.F.S. techs are still taking apart
Bosco's office, but so far...

230
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:02,696
Is Jane back?

231
00:15:02,821 --> 00:15:04,989
- I haven't seen him.
- Find him, would you?

232
00:15:05,498 --> 00:15:07,917
Special agents
Nick Martinez and Mark Dyson

233
00:15:08,042 --> 00:15:09,692
died at the scene here.

234
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:12,886
And special agent Marlon Hicks

235
00:15:13,011 --> 00:15:15,661
was found dead
at a secondary crime scene.

236
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:18,790
Special agent Samuel Bosco

237
00:15:18,995 --> 00:15:20,627
remains in critical condition.

238
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:24,883
We are devoting every resource
to this investigation, and I promise...

239
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,224
I promise the agents' families,

240
00:15:27,349 --> 00:15:28,737
we will not rest

241
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,847
until we bring the perpetrator
to justice.

242
00:15:33,248 --> 00:15:35,748
Special agent Minelli,
our condolences.

243
00:15:35,873 --> 00:15:39,338
Would you describe your feelings
at this terrible time?

244
00:15:39,846 --> 00:15:41,446
Wow, Meredith. That...

245
00:15:42,849 --> 00:15:44,849
you media guys, that's just...

246
00:15:49,003 --> 00:15:50,855
You know, for eight years,

247
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,730
I've put up
with the idiotic questions of the media,

248
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,655
and I've never said squat.

249
00:15:56,365 --> 00:15:57,490
But today...

250
00:15:58,315 --> 00:16:00,000
i must tell you, Meredith,

251
00:16:01,205 --> 00:16:03,068
you've really set a new standard

252
00:16:03,431 --> 00:16:05,072
in horse's assery.

253
00:16:08,765 --> 00:16:11,609
You people have no concept

254
00:16:12,715 --> 00:16:13,847
of what we do.

255
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:15,807
We go into dark,

256
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,058
horrible places, alone

257
00:16:18,914 --> 00:16:19,992
and afraid,

258
00:16:20,883 --> 00:16:22,397
and we do it with no money,

259
00:16:22,687 --> 00:16:24,234
broken-down vehicles with...

260
00:16:25,055 --> 00:16:27,819
computers that have more
viruses than a $10 whore.

261
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:30,197
How?

262
00:16:30,515 --> 00:16:31,615
Good people.

263
00:16:34,273 --> 00:16:36,968
I lost three good people today,

264
00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:39,371
and a fourth
who's in critical condition,

265
00:16:39,664 --> 00:16:41,738
and you ask me how i'm feeling?

266
00:16:43,978 --> 00:16:45,572
I'm feeling sad...

267
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:47,755
You...

268
00:16:48,501 --> 00:16:49,382
moron.

269
00:16:53,136 --> 00:16:54,304
Any other questions?

270
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,914
Good day to you.
Elizabeth, carry on.

271
00:17:10,035 --> 00:17:11,285
Horse's assery.

272
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:12,698
Nice.

273
00:17:13,141 --> 00:17:14,199
I shouldn't have.

274
00:17:15,547 --> 00:17:17,676
- You told them the truth.
- I did.

275
00:17:18,803 --> 00:17:19,746
It felt good.

276
00:17:22,176 --> 00:17:24,042
Stick with us, boss.
We need you.

277
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,089
I gotta run. You got this?

278
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:48,714
Evening, gentlemen.

279
00:18:00,311 --> 00:18:02,011
- You are?
- I'm sorry.

280
00:18:04,553 --> 00:18:06,459
I'm a friend of his.
How's he doing?

281
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,998
He's not good.

282
00:18:09,012 --> 00:18:10,805
The next two days
should tell us a lot.

283
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12,211
He was in such pain.

284
00:18:12,336 --> 00:18:14,968
- Is he getting enough morphine?
- He should be.

285
00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:20,306
Looks good.
Call me if you need anything.

286
00:18:20,596 --> 00:18:21,956
Will do. Thanks, doc.

287
00:18:31,624 --> 00:18:32,944
What are you doing?

288
00:18:35,109 --> 00:18:36,754
Unplugging his morphine.

289
00:18:36,879 --> 00:18:39,414
I'd ask a doctor to do it,
i think i know what they'd say.

290
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:40,629
Are you crazy?

291
00:18:42,071 --> 00:18:43,809
That's exactly what they'd say.

292
00:18:44,433 --> 00:18:46,458
They wouldn't understand
the moral imperative.

293
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:50,919
Bosco is the only person

294
00:18:51,044 --> 00:18:53,180
that can tell us
what he found on Red John.

295
00:18:53,956 --> 00:18:55,196
Now he may die.

296
00:18:55,883 --> 00:18:58,555
We need to wake him up and have him
tell us everything he knows,

297
00:18:58,963 --> 00:19:00,278
while he still can.

298
00:19:08,502 --> 00:19:10,648
- You can't do that.
- Why not?

299
00:19:11,164 --> 00:19:13,985
Morphine doesn't make him any better.
It just stops the pain.

300
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,702
Yes, that's what it does.

301
00:19:16,593 --> 00:19:17,871
Pain is nothing.

302
00:19:17,996 --> 00:19:20,825
Pain means he's still alive.
We need him now, Lisbon,

303
00:19:21,217 --> 00:19:21,951
now.

304
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,703
He's useless to us when he's dead.

305
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,705
- Shut up. He's gonna live.
- Maybe

306
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,282
and maybe not.

307
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:30,162
God, you're a cold bastard.

308
00:19:31,228 --> 00:19:34,756
You need to think logically.
He would want us to do this.

309
00:19:35,177 --> 00:19:37,756
How could you know what he would want?
You don't even know him.

310
00:19:37,881 --> 00:19:40,989
But you do. If he had
to suffer pain to stop Red John,

311
00:19:41,114 --> 00:19:42,889
he would do that.
And you know that.

312
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,541
- You know that.
- What's all the commotion?

313
00:19:45,963 --> 00:19:48,341
What the...
did you touch that machine?

314
00:19:58,606 --> 00:19:59,614
<i>Good people.</i>

315
00:20:01,343 --> 00:20:02,575
<i>I've lost three</i>

316
00:20:03,652 --> 00:20:05,370
<i>good people today...</i>

317
00:20:07,012 --> 00:20:08,272
Is Lisbon with you?

318
00:20:11,571 --> 00:20:12,669
What's going on?

319
00:20:13,352 --> 00:20:15,989
We got a hit
on Bosco's cell phone records.

320
00:20:16,294 --> 00:20:18,550
Before the attack,
Bosco called a cop in Cloverville,

321
00:20:18,923 --> 00:20:20,134
not far from Stockton.

322
00:20:20,526 --> 00:20:23,134
The cop told me when they tore down
an old strip mall last week,

323
00:20:23,259 --> 00:20:25,431
- They found a body in the foundation.
- A body?

324
00:20:25,665 --> 00:20:28,202
The cop who posted the bulletin
said he got a call from Bosco,

325
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:30,478
- saying he'd go and check it out.
- What body?

326
00:20:31,841 --> 00:20:32,689
This one.

327
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:35,431
Cloverville P.D.
E-mailed a copy of the x-rays.

328
00:20:35,556 --> 00:20:36,756
John Doe, 30s.

329
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,498
See here?
His head was almost cut off.

330
00:20:39,751 --> 00:20:41,651
Vicious.
Then there's this.

331
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:43,908
What's that?

332
00:20:44,306 --> 00:20:46,185
- His leg.
- He's missing a leg?

333
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,278
The Coroner told
it was not part of the attack.

334
00:20:48,403 --> 00:20:50,498
A much earlier amputation,
he said. Distinctive.

335
00:20:51,147 --> 00:20:53,167
The files we got from
Dr. Morning's office...

336
00:20:53,292 --> 00:20:55,044
This matches an X-ray
we found there.

337
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,212
Carter Peak.

338
00:20:56,449 --> 00:20:57,768
Carter Peak retired army,

339
00:20:57,893 --> 00:20:59,888
lost his right leg
during the first gulf war.

340
00:21:00,013 --> 00:21:01,719
They found
the missing Red John victim.

341
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:02,923
Better still.

342
00:21:03,731 --> 00:21:05,179
This is Red John's mistake.

343
00:21:05,969 --> 00:21:06,969
This is it.

344
00:21:07,446 --> 00:21:09,350
He made a mistake, and this is it.

345
00:21:21,129 --> 00:21:23,273
Killing Carter Peak
wasn't Red John's M.O.

346
00:21:23,398 --> 00:21:25,324
He was a man
who was killed with his wife.

347
00:21:25,449 --> 00:21:27,173
His body was removed from the scene.

348
00:21:27,298 --> 00:21:29,454
Is unlike any of Red John's
14 other murders.

349
00:21:30,053 --> 00:21:33,499
Maybe Carter returned unexpectedly.
Maybe there was a struggle.

350
00:21:34,443 --> 00:21:37,748
So Peak's body resurfaces.
Red John hears about it somehow,

351
00:21:38,403 --> 00:21:39,605
and it upsets him.

352
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,467
<i>A, how does he hear about the body?</i>

353
00:21:43,111 --> 00:21:45,428
Off the bulletin, i guess.
It was statewide.

354
00:21:45,829 --> 00:21:47,972
<i>And B, why does it upset him?</i>

355
00:21:48,274 --> 00:21:51,188
There's evidence on Carter Peak's body.
He tried to make it disappear.

356
00:21:51,313 --> 00:21:53,508
Damning evidence, like DNA.

357
00:21:54,491 --> 00:21:55,772
Let's go to Cloverville.

358
00:21:59,664 --> 00:22:02,043
The cement matrix
preserved the body remarkably well.

359
00:22:02,168 --> 00:22:04,270
We were able to run
a full DNA crime kit.

360
00:22:04,395 --> 00:22:06,262
Hair, skin,
under the fingernails, ect...

361
00:22:06,387 --> 00:22:08,266
We need someone on this place 24/7

362
00:22:08,391 --> 00:22:10,485
until we can move the body
to Sacramento.

363
00:22:21,321 --> 00:22:22,321
My bad.

364
00:22:28,071 --> 00:22:29,055
That's weird.

365
00:22:29,693 --> 00:22:32,183
Yeah, it is.
Where's the body, doc?

366
00:22:33,466 --> 00:22:35,036
Let me check the log here.

367
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:44,190
You guys gotta get your signals
straightened up in Sacramento.

368
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:46,610
CBI already picked up the body
night before last.

369
00:22:46,735 --> 00:22:47,595
CBI did?

370
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,798
Yeah, night shift
logged it right here.

371
00:22:50,219 --> 00:22:53,149
California Bureau of Investigation,
an agent Rojo.

372
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:55,130
The body, samples,

373
00:22:55,528 --> 00:22:57,883
everything we had, it looks like.
See for yourself.

374
00:22:59,254 --> 00:23:01,504
Arrived at 2:15 a.m.
with meat wagon.

375
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:03,131
The night before the attack.

376
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,518
I can get you photos, though.
We usually keep a set.

377
00:23:05,643 --> 00:23:08,177
But the crime scene kit,
the DNA samples. What about it?

378
00:23:08,861 --> 00:23:11,107
I'm telling ya,
it should've all gone with your guy.

379
00:23:11,232 --> 00:23:13,050
- That's procedure.
- He wasn't him.

380
00:23:13,175 --> 00:23:15,219
- Red John?
- Call in your night shift person.

381
00:23:15,344 --> 00:23:18,688
It's important that we get an idea
of what this, agent Rojo looks like.

382
00:23:23,896 --> 00:23:26,529
- You wanted to see me, boss?
- Sit down, please.

383
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,992
Bosco's doing better.
I talked to his doctor.

384
00:23:33,937 --> 00:23:34,937
That's good.

385
00:23:36,501 --> 00:23:37,623
You okay, boss?

386
00:23:38,829 --> 00:23:40,982
Is this about before,
the press conference?

387
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,687
I have something to tell you,

388
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,352
Something important.

389
00:23:55,021 --> 00:23:55,892
What is it?

390
00:23:56,339 --> 00:23:58,519
Sorry to interrupt,
but i've been going through

391
00:23:58,644 --> 00:24:01,212
the security footage, trying to ID.
Everyone going in and out.

392
00:24:02,093 --> 00:24:04,567
This is timecoded for this morning,
right before the attack.

393
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:07,229
According
to employee support services,

394
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:09,934
that's Amblyn Demott,
an analyst on four.

395
00:24:10,731 --> 00:24:11,657
So what?

396
00:24:11,966 --> 00:24:14,060
Demott went on maternity
leave last month.

397
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,079
She had her baby yesterday.

398
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:18,956
There's no way she could be where
that camera says she was.

399
00:24:19,721 --> 00:24:21,363
Someone switched the footage.

400
00:24:21,972 --> 00:24:24,257
We can't trust
anything on any camera.

401
00:24:27,571 --> 00:24:29,939
You transferred the body
to the custody of a CBI agent?

402
00:24:30,841 --> 00:24:32,134
Describe this agent.

403
00:24:32,726 --> 00:24:35,392
Dark hair, not that tall,
kinda dumpy,

404
00:24:35,904 --> 00:24:37,016
olive-complected,

405
00:24:37,447 --> 00:24:39,936
- wore these heels that clicked...
- A woman?

406
00:24:40,494 --> 00:24:41,804
Wore a thing,

407
00:24:42,331 --> 00:24:44,065
- whatsit, in her hair.
- A barrette.

408
00:24:44,569 --> 00:24:45,823
Right. Barrette.

409
00:24:54,103 --> 00:24:55,253
Hey, sweetie.

410
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,630
Have a nice day.

411
00:25:09,309 --> 00:25:11,078
Hello, Barney. How you doing?

412
00:25:45,047 --> 00:25:46,725
Weren't you heading to Cloverville?

413
00:25:47,101 --> 00:25:48,588
As soon as i brief Jane.

414
00:25:50,357 --> 00:25:52,425
Samuel Bosco, Jr.
Getting soft.

415
00:25:53,781 --> 00:25:55,319
Screw you, Martinez.

416
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,014
Look what i have.

417
00:25:58,285 --> 00:26:00,441
You're the best.
Did you get the coffee?

418
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:06,105
- You okay?
- A-okay, boss.

419
00:26:37,201 --> 00:26:38,701
Red John says hi.

420
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:10,127
Hey.

421
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,452
Don't move. Drop your gun.

422
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:18,594
Bitch.

423
00:27:19,491 --> 00:27:20,491
You bitch.

424
00:27:21,202 --> 00:27:22,139
Don't move

425
00:27:22,421 --> 00:27:24,767
Don't breathe
and don't you smiled me.

426
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:33,359
What the hell's
with all the balloons?

427
00:27:37,209 --> 00:27:38,698
What are you doing here?

428
00:27:39,655 --> 00:27:40,827
Get her outta here.

429
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:57,635
How long are they sit there?

430
00:29:04,418 --> 00:29:06,112
What's your favorite kind of music?

431
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:08,512
Mr. Jane,

432
00:29:09,094 --> 00:29:10,094
please.

433
00:29:11,169 --> 00:29:12,434
I know your games.

434
00:29:13,255 --> 00:29:15,252
You don't care
what type of music i like.

435
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:18,631
I'm just making conversation,
getting to know you.

436
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:22,301
You want to know how i could do
such terrible things for Red John.

437
00:29:22,733 --> 00:29:24,016
I know that stuff...

438
00:29:24,731 --> 00:29:26,043
unhappy childhood,

439
00:29:26,255 --> 00:29:28,474
sexually abused by a close relative,

440
00:29:28,955 --> 00:29:31,477
cutting or some other self-abuse,

441
00:29:33,005 --> 00:29:34,973
self-medicating, self-loathing.

442
00:29:35,829 --> 00:29:38,630
Everyone you ever met
made you feel ashamed,

443
00:29:41,184 --> 00:29:42,434
ashamed of that

444
00:29:42,867 --> 00:29:43,867
ugly

445
00:29:44,077 --> 00:29:45,077
darkness

446
00:29:45,555 --> 00:29:47,289
festering inside you.

447
00:29:48,239 --> 00:29:49,239
But he didn't.

448
00:29:49,938 --> 00:29:52,540
He made you strong.
He made you feel proud of that darkness.

449
00:29:54,949 --> 00:29:55,957
Yes, he did.

450
00:29:56,082 --> 00:29:58,066
He gave your life
purpose and meaning

451
00:29:58,511 --> 00:29:59,213
and...

452
00:29:59,847 --> 00:30:00,847
love.

453
00:30:01,757 --> 00:30:03,217
You're very much like him,.

454
00:30:04,018 --> 00:30:06,313
The way you look at people
and see right through them.

455
00:30:06,438 --> 00:30:07,773
That is just spooky.

456
00:30:11,531 --> 00:30:14,238
I want you to think of this tonight
before you go to sleep.

457
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:21,609
You are nothing to him
but a useful object.

458
00:30:23,496 --> 00:30:24,822
He is not a good man.

459
00:30:25,558 --> 00:30:27,011
You are so wrong.

460
00:30:28,265 --> 00:30:29,636
He is a very good man.

461
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:32,167
He's on a mission...

462
00:30:32,824 --> 00:30:34,707
of love and enlightenment.

463
00:30:35,191 --> 00:30:37,168
He tortures and kills women.

464
00:30:37,746 --> 00:30:39,199
<i>Don't you see?</i>

465
00:30:39,819 --> 00:30:40,839
<i>Without death,</i>

466
00:30:41,636 --> 00:30:42,798
<i>there's no life.</i>

467
00:30:43,792 --> 00:30:46,107
<i>Without darkness, there's no light.</i>

468
00:30:46,956 --> 00:30:48,292
- Look at you.
- Me?

469
00:30:49,382 --> 00:30:50,556
Well, until your

470
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:53,658
wife and your daughter were killed,
you were blind, weren't you?

471
00:30:54,408 --> 00:30:56,130
You were living an illusion.

472
00:30:56,704 --> 00:30:58,298
Red John opened your eyes.

473
00:30:58,966 --> 00:31:01,216
And now you see the world
for what it truly is.

474
00:31:10,402 --> 00:31:12,055
How did you first meet him?

475
00:31:12,293 --> 00:31:14,371
I'm not telling you anything
about him.

476
00:31:15,324 --> 00:31:16,324
You will.

477
00:31:17,714 --> 00:31:20,153
You'll wake up one day,
horrified of what you've done,

478
00:31:20,938 --> 00:31:23,364
- and you will tell me everything.
- No, never.

479
00:31:23,968 --> 00:31:25,268
I love Red John.

480
00:31:25,555 --> 00:31:27,894
And he loves me,
i will never betray that trust.

481
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:29,386
One day.

482
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:32,991
But i will tell you
that i like all kinds of music.

483
00:31:33,495 --> 00:31:36,310
Especially country.
And i have a cat named rex.

484
00:31:37,269 --> 00:31:39,563
And i collect porcelain frogs.

485
00:31:39,812 --> 00:31:41,851
Don't ask me why.
It's just a quirk, really.

486
00:31:42,875 --> 00:31:43,960
The psychologist

487
00:31:44,085 --> 00:31:46,570
want to talk to you next.
He'll have a field day with that.

488
00:31:48,068 --> 00:31:50,377
I'm as sane
and as healthy as can be.

489
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:53,312
- I really am.
- I know.

490
00:31:54,109 --> 00:31:56,300
Have one question before you go.

491
00:31:56,617 --> 00:32:00,027
After you took Carter Peak's body
and all the DNA samples...

492
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:03,855
Why did Red John
have you attack Bosco's team?

493
00:32:05,741 --> 00:32:07,194
There was really no need.

494
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,022
The evidence was destroyed.

495
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,254
You know why.

496
00:32:12,157 --> 00:32:13,138
You don't?

497
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,153
Red John thought you'd understand.

498
00:32:17,934 --> 00:32:20,184
I got rid of Bosco and his team

499
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:22,439
so that you could have the case back

500
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:26,503
Red John misses you.

501
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:31,530
It's what you wanted, too.

502
00:32:33,134 --> 00:32:34,134
Isn't it?

503
00:32:49,846 --> 00:32:50,936
We're done here.

504
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:58,230
Interesting talking to you, Rebecca.

505
00:32:58,676 --> 00:32:59,676
Likewise.

506
00:33:01,418 --> 00:33:02,824
I guess i'll see you around.

507
00:34:32,714 --> 00:34:34,071
<i>Officer needs assistance.</i>

508
00:34:34,425 --> 00:34:36,441
<i>She's down. She's down.</i>

509
00:34:44,185 --> 00:34:45,485
Don't touch her!

510
00:34:57,985 --> 00:34:59,298
He poisoned her.

511
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:27,291
Mandy... you get ahold of her?

512
00:35:28,338 --> 00:35:30,411
All the flights out
of Boston were delayed.

513
00:35:31,104 --> 00:35:32,287
She's in the air now.

514
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,841
She'll be here soon.
It's all right.

515
00:35:36,858 --> 00:35:38,051
You're gonna be okay.

516
00:35:38,756 --> 00:35:39,869
It's gonna be okay.

517
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,494
Don't lie to me.

518
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,848
I can tell when you're lying.

519
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,880
You are.

520
00:35:51,415 --> 00:35:53,256
Look, you will be...
you'll be okay.

521
00:35:55,234 --> 00:35:56,234
I'm a cop.

522
00:35:57,857 --> 00:35:59,052
You're a bad liar.

523
00:36:00,357 --> 00:36:02,367
Your eyes give you away every time.

524
00:36:03,026 --> 00:36:04,026
Honest eyes.

525
00:36:06,952 --> 00:36:08,252
Tell me the truth.

526
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,401
You lost a lot of blood.

527
00:36:17,721 --> 00:36:19,718
The doctors don't think
you're gonna make it.

528
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,331
I'm gonna say it, then.

529
00:36:26,288 --> 00:36:27,870
The doctors better be right.

530
00:36:30,237 --> 00:36:31,561
I love you, Teresa.

531
00:36:35,194 --> 00:36:36,273
I love you, too.

532
00:36:38,042 --> 00:36:39,822
No. I mean, i love you.

533
00:36:40,339 --> 00:36:41,628
I know what you mean.

534
00:36:47,621 --> 00:36:49,021
It had to be said.

535
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,640
Is Jane here?

536
00:37:02,312 --> 00:37:03,562
For the record,

537
00:37:05,019 --> 00:37:06,801
i'm very pissed off about this.

538
00:37:07,855 --> 00:37:09,051
Can't blame you.

539
00:37:12,567 --> 00:37:14,266
We don't have time to be nice.

540
00:37:16,629 --> 00:37:18,598
Red John makes mistakes.

541
00:37:19,254 --> 00:37:20,362
This proves it.

542
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:23,323
- You will catch him.
- Yes, i will.

543
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:25,910
Do me a favor.

544
00:37:27,093 --> 00:37:29,493
When you catch him,
don't arrest him.

545
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:32,457
Kill the son of a bitch.

546
00:37:33,156 --> 00:37:34,304
That's the plan.

547
00:37:34,925 --> 00:37:35,925
Good.

548
00:37:37,562 --> 00:37:38,617
Listen...

549
00:38:15,425 --> 00:38:17,165
UNE SEMAINE PLUS TARD

550
00:38:26,873 --> 00:38:28,996
- You weren't at the funeral.
- I was there.

551
00:38:29,747 --> 00:38:30,933
I stayed in the back.

552
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:33,509
You're quitting?

553
00:38:34,905 --> 00:38:36,605
I tried to tell you before.

554
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:40,063
Anyway, i prefer "retiring."

555
00:38:41,831 --> 00:38:44,342
Full pension.
I got my 20 and then some.

556
00:38:45,397 --> 00:38:46,397
Okay, then.

557
00:38:47,157 --> 00:38:50,056
We'll stay here and catch the bad guys
while you go fishing.

558
00:38:55,327 --> 00:38:58,494
In my eight years as SAC,
i've lost four agents...

559
00:38:58,619 --> 00:38:59,920
all of them this week.

560
00:39:00,576 --> 00:39:02,175
You should have quit last week.

561
00:39:02,418 --> 00:39:03,544
It's too late now.

562
00:39:05,221 --> 00:39:06,221
It's time.

563
00:39:10,067 --> 00:39:12,460
You take care of your people.
They're good kids.

564
00:39:14,264 --> 00:39:16,540
Keep an eye on Jane.
If he screws up too bad,

565
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:18,311
shoot him.

566
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:21,267
There's not a court in the land
that would convict you.

567
00:39:52,017 --> 00:39:53,143
Out Minelli.

568
00:39:57,472 --> 00:39:58,437
I'm sorry.

569
00:40:04,126 --> 00:40:05,170
You and Bosco,

570
00:40:06,075 --> 00:40:07,319
at the hospital...

571
00:40:09,252 --> 00:40:10,449
What'd he say?

572
00:40:16,835 --> 00:40:18,290
He told me to look after you.

573
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:22,961
That's all?

574
00:40:27,025 --> 00:40:29,843
He said that if i didn't look after you,
he'd come back and haunt me.

575
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:33,555
Total nonsense, of course,

576
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:35,600
it wasn't the right time
to correct him.

577
00:40:39,392 --> 00:40:40,565
Bosco's favorite.

578
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:51,061
Pint of scotch, left of the fridge,
top shelf, behind the ramen.

579
00:40:54,007 --> 00:40:55,007
To Sam Bosco.

580
00:40:55,837 --> 00:40:57,237
A damn fine agent.

581
00:41:07,711 --> 00:41:09,224
It was a nice service.

582
00:41:11,383 --> 00:41:12,383
Nice music.

583
00:41:12,697 --> 00:41:14,879
- Not a fan of the bagpipes.
- Really?

584
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:16,606
I love 'em.

585
00:41:17,014 --> 00:41:18,014
They're so...

586
00:41:18,844 --> 00:41:19,844
Lonely.

587
00:41:20,783 --> 00:41:22,086
It was a nice service.
