4
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:40,610
I don't know, but she actually
called and said that she'd done it.

5
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,350
Anything else you guys
hear, let us know, okay?

6
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,120
Thank you.

7
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,750
Kid's name's cody elkins, 16 years old.

8
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,410
Reported missing a couple days ago.

9
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,200
Turned serious enough to call us when
the local policemen found the boy's shoe

10
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,950
two streets away in a gutter.

11
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,560
Waiting on the d.n.a.We figure it's
an abduction, potential homicide,

12
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,590
which makes it a cbi case.

13
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,540
The parents are michael
and janice, both clean.

14
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,590
They have another son named brad, 14.

15
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,990
They own a flower shop
here. Cho's with 'em now.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,950
Let's go.

17
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,830
Think i'll just wait out here.

18
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,670
Sure, whatever.

19
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:01,120
- Hey, dude.
- Nice bike.

20
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:05,710
You boys gotta be pretty anxious
to see something to ride this, huh?

21
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,010
You didn't ride a pink bike through
town to come to the store, did you?

22
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,010
- What'd you come to see?
- Nothing.

23
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,080
- Really?
- Let's go, clyde.

24
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,710
Where's cody elkins?

25
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,700
I don't know.

26
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,270
I know you guys know where he is.

27
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,560
You don't have to tell me out loud.
Just look in the direction. That way?

28
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,390
Why did you do that?

29
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,190
Thank you. Here's your bike.

30
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,830
Be safe.

31
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,500
Cho's gonna bring the elkins home.

32
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,470
I have a pretty good
idea where cody elkins is.

33
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,870
Sharing is good.

34
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,040
What makes you think it's him?

35
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,780
Because those kids gave it away.
Plus they smelled like eucalyptus.

36
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,540
But there's eucalyptus
trees all over around here.

37
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:02,260
- Crows.
- So?

38
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:05,500
Crows are carrion birds.
They like dead things.

39
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,540
Oh,jeez.

40
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,880
Poor kid.

41
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:04,010
What does it mean?

42
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,600
Black magic. Sacrifice.

43
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,990
But there's no such
thing as black magic.

44
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,960
Well,somebody disagrees.

48
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,960
We're looking for a murder weapon.

49
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:41,090
Anything you find,anything at
all,tag it and bag it. Thanks,guys.

50
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:48,530
Wait a second.

51
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,940
When did you last see cody?

52
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,920
Friday night, after the game.

53
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:04,170
Cody plays wide receiver
for his high school team.

54
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,230
Uh,they got blown out
pretty good that night.

55
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,470
But,uh,it's a pretty
good team this year.

56
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:11,620
It's nationally ranked.

57
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:14,700
When exactly did you
see him last on friday?

58
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,970
Uh,when he went to bed.

59
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,530
We were,all three of us,
out early the next morning.

60
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:23,540
When we came back that
afternoon,cody was gone.

61
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,940
He was,uh,supposed to meet his
coach the next morning for,uh,

62
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,870
Some extra practice,
but he never showed up.

63
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,140
***

64
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:38,010
And that friday night,
what was his state of mind?

65
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,140
He was fine. Fine.

66
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,890
He was a little upset with
himself about the game.

67
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,080
He'd,uh,made some
mental errors,you know?

68
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,870
Coach d. Got on him pretty good.

69
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,500
Cody kind of pushed back
a little bit,i guess.

70
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,730
They had a fight?

71
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,200
You could say.

72
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:59,500
It's nothing serious-- locker
room stuff, a little shouting.

73
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,830
Cody just wanted to do better.

74
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:04,630
How did he die?

75
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:08,200
There were indications around the body
of some kind of black magic ritual.

76
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,360
Now did he have any friends or acquaintances
who were involved in that kind of thing?

77
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,990
Oh,my god.

78
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,840
It washer.

79
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,700
Of course.

80
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,610
- Who's this?
- Tamzin dove.

81
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:23,420
She's into all that black magic crap.

82
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:26,200
She's... Claims to be a witch.

83
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,250
Says she has powers.

84
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:33,520
And did she have some sort
of resentment toward cody?

85
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,300
About a-a week ago, she,uh...

86
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,920
She claimed that cody stole her cat.

87
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:42,480
- Did he?
- No. Of course not.

88
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:46,350
But she put a spell on him in revenge.

89
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,350
A spell? What kind of spell?

90
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,280
I don't know, but she actually
called and said that she'd done it.

91
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,950
That must have been worrisome.

92
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,420
At the time,cody thought
it was kind of funny.

93
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:00,740
I mean, she's a-a geek,you know?

94
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,730
I think that's why we didn't
think about her right away.

95
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:06,240
Where can we find tamzin dove?

96
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,880
Things are getting weird already.

97
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,200
We're off to see a witch.

98
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,320
Oh,be careful.

99
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,860
Yeah,yeah. You find
anything useful there?

100
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,670
Nothing--no murder
weapon, not a lot of blood.

101
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:19,300
Looks like he was killed elsewhere.

102
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,140
M.e. Estimates that he
died on saturday morning,

103
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:28,710
The cause being several blows with a heavy,blunt
object like a crowbar or a pipe,maybe.

104
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:31,740
Okay,i want you two to go and
talk to cody's football coach.

105
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,550
He and the kid had a
fight on friday night.

106
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,350
They were supposed to meet
up on saturday morning.

107
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,870
Got it. We got the football beat.

108
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,240
Okay.

109
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,280
Look--a
goat.

110
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,820
Goats are signs of satan.

111
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,900
So petting zoos are,like,
gateways to hell?

112
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:56,290
Very much.

113
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:00,340
Ooh,look,another bad sign.

114
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:20,540
You shouldn't joke around
about this kind of stuff.

115
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,240
It doesn't look like anybody's home.

116
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,280
Not much security for
a servant of the devil.

117
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,980
I could pick that lock with
this in about five seconds.

118
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,080
We'll wait.

119
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:36,100
Don't look now, but we should grab
one of those kids and talk to 'em.

120
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,090
Damn.

121
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,300
Are they the same kids
from the elkins shop?

122
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:43,160
Yes.

123
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,360
Let's see some hustle out there now!

124
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:56,220
It's a tragedy. His whole life
ahead of him. Great kid,too.

125
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,810
Go,go,go,go,go,go!

126
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,490
Vinson,you manatee!

127
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,740
Move your lard butt downfield!

128
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,480
Great kid. Good values,good habits.

129
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,310
You were supposed to meet
with him saturday morning?

130
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:14,640
That's right. Right here,9:00 a.m.,
for some serious fumble prevention reps.

131
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:15,640
He never showed.

132
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,100
You and he had serious
words friday night,right?

133
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:24,760
Yeah,cody had a shameful game-- zero
t.d.s,two fumbles and five blown routes--

134
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,470
A personal foul that cost us 15 yards.

135
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,680
He let himself down
and let his team down.

136
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,780
That's been his m.o.lately.

137
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,150
That's why we were meeting on saturday
morning, to get him back on track.

138
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,650
"shameful"--that's
kind of harsh,isn't it?

139
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,580
I run a reality-based program here.

140
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,230
If you want to hear malarkey,
try the english department.

141
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,450
Tillis! I can see you,
tillis! I can see you.

142
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,900
What did cody have to say in reply?

143
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:50,600
What i discussed with
cody is nobody's business.

144
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,440
People have no freakin' idea how
it is between a coach and his team.

145
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,510
Oh,we have an idea.

146
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,390
I doubt it.

147
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,590
We looked into your history, mr. Dieter.

148
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:00,040
Five years ago,you lost a high
school coaching job in oregon

149
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:02,500
for inappropriate physical
contact with students.

150
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,070
Wait a minute.

151
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,980
You make that sound like i'm
a sex molester or somethin'.

152
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,860
I smacked a couple of kids because
they needed an attitude adjustment.

153
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,000
Their pantywaist parents
made an issue of it.

154
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,020
- That's okay then?
- It's football.

155
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,680
Actually, that's assault on a minor.

156
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,370
There were no charges filed.

157
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:20,000
- But you had to resign.
- No. No,i chose to resign.

158
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,450
With a promise to take
anger management class.

159
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,820
36 hours' worth. I did my time.

160
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:27,530
Bored the rage right out of me.

161
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,580
Ask all the questions you want.

162
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,070
- I'm not trying to hide something here.
- Good.

163
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,120
We need to search the school
gym and the locker rooms.

164
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,890
Do whatever you gotta do. Frank!

165
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,320
Frank,you need to pull around
him, and you need to get upfield.

166
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,240
No,your strong side
tackle should do that.

167
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:45,150
He's got the better first set, and
your tight end's jumping his route.

168
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:55,450
Hey,quick hands, think
fast. Hit me. I'm open.

169
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,430
Uh,no.

170
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,060
What kind of coach's kid are you?

171
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,190
Your daddy would be ashamed.

172
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,430
Fine. Go long.

173
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,590
Oh,nice!

174
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:15,410
- Hey,check this out.
- Interesting.

175
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,040
Let's get this to forensics.

176
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,130
Okay,boss.

177
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:35,100
Minelli says we can go in. The
warrant's on its way. Let's do this.

178
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:38,020
Bet you can't do it in five...

179
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,920
Never mind.

180
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,870
- What's wrong?
- I'll wait out here.

181
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,600
Why?

182
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,950
All right,i'll go in, but you first.

183
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,690
- Hello.
- Hello.

184
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,270
Welcome.

185
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,760
You must be the cbi.

186
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,560
- Please sit down.
- Thank you.

187
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,610
Why didn't you just let us in?

188
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,390
If i had,i wouldn't have
the upper hand,now would i?

189
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,200
So you were expecting us.

190
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,720
Of course.

191
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,650
I heard what was done to cody elkins.

192
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:31,200
They used a pentacle and a flame,
made it look like witchcraft--wicca.

193
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,470
Naturally,you'd come to me.

194
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:38,370
I'm the only witch in town.

195
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:47,700
Those details about that-- no,thank
you--pentacles, and the candles weren't made public.

196
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,540
- How did you know about them?
- Yes,please.

197
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,470
Friends.

198
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,070
So your friends were
involved in cody's death?

199
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:54,820
No.

200
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,870
Are these friends small with long hair?

201
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,420
The big one's name is clyde?

202
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:00,860
He has a sister with a pink bike?

203
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:02,490
Yes,that's them.

204
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,190
You're friends with a lot of kids then.

205
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,990
Yes,kids...

206
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:11,620
They like mystery and
darkness, and i like kids.

207
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,550
What do their parents
have to say about that?

208
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:19,100
The kids that come here come because
their parents don't give a hoot.

209
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:23,140
But they had nothing to do with cody's
death, nor the pentacle and the candles.

210
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,370
What were they doing in the woods,then?

211
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,720
- Picking herbs for me.
- Herbs?

212
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:31,520
Fenugreek, wild roses,nettles.

213
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,600
Please.

214
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:44,160
I make and sell wicca healing
powders on the internet.

215
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:46,060
You should check out my web site.

216
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:48,600
Why didn't you tell the police
your friends found a body?

217
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,270
What for?

218
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:54,170
I knew the earth and the rain and
the animals would take care of cody.

219
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,800
You can't help him.

220
00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:01,100
It's true. We can't, but what wecando is
find and punish the people who murdered him.

221
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:05,530
There's no need. Cody deserved
to die. He was a bad person.

222
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:10,080
He stole and tortured and killed my cat.

223
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,900
I saw him take it.

224
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,060
Why would he do that?

225
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,350
Fear,i guess.

226
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,500
That's just the way
it is with the cowen.

227
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,460
They live in fear.

228
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,480
The cowen?

229
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,210
Those who are not wicca.

230
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,260
Those who unbelieve our powers.

231
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:27,440
What powers are you
talking about,exactly?

232
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,960
A witch is simply a high
priestess of the wicca.

233
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,040
We worship the horned god
and the triple goddess.

234
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:38,240
We're healers mostly, but we
have the magic also, when needed--

235
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:40,120
Spells and so forth.

236
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,880
Did you put a spell on cody elkins?

237
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,810
I did.

238
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,190
I put a killing spell on him.

239
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:51,730
I'd done the spell several times before,
but this is the first time it's worked.

240
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,750
What does the spelling involve?

241
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,670
What do you do,exactly?

242
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,590
Why am i here?

243
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,550
So you can explain to us
why forensics tells us that

244
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,180
your blood was found l over a
t-shirt we found in cody's locker.

245
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,100
I told you, we had an argument.

246
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,870
Oh,so now you're saying
you had an actual fistfight?

247
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,160
- You drew blood?
- Yeah.

248
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:16,480
It was no big deal. I
chewed him out. He got mad.

249
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,240
He took a couple of swings at me.

250
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,040
Laid out by a kid,huh?

251
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,430
It was a lucky punch.

252
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:23,870
So your own student beats you
up,and you don't tell anyone?

253
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,490
It was no big deal.

254
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:29,000
Or maybe you figured you're gonna get even with
him the next morning, so best keep it quiet,huh?

255
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,690
No. No.

256
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,080
I was too embarrassed.

257
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,910
People don't know the
kid is a freaking nut bag.

258
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:39,530
Makes me look bad either way, so
i just pretended it didn't happen.

259
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,750
He hit you first--
his own coach?

260
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,220
I told you--a
nut bag.

261
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,850
Well, that's not what we've heard.

262
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,730
Ask daniel brown.

263
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,850
He's a good friend of cody's.

264
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:52,310
Last month cody got mad over
a card game or something.

265
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,640
Beat danno unconscious. Had
to be dragged off of him.

266
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:56,530
I don't know why danno
didn't press charges.

267
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,350
- Daniel brown?
- Yeah.

268
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:11,980
Killing spells are secret, but this is a public
binding spell that icanshow you, and it's similar.

269
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,300
- What is your name?
- What's it to you?

270
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,180
Kimball cho.

271
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,450
God and goddess,hear me.

272
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:26,870
By light of the one flame, let this mortal
soul, kimball cho, be bound by my power.

273
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,340
So that he knows i speak truth,

274
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:34,060
let him behold the king of
beasts and kneel before him.

275
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,130
Come on.

276
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,520
That's it? That's your spell?

277
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:57,620
You're not gonna make him drink
a potion or anything like that?

278
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,660
Doesn't look like much, does it?

279
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:01,270
But it's very powerful magic.

280
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,590
Yeah,okay.

281
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:08,010
Unfortunately it seems that one of your friends
helped your magic along with a blunt instrument.

282
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:11,370
In which case, you're as
unmagically guilty as they are.

283
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,100
If a friend of mine had done this,

284
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:16,850
They wouldn't have pointed the police
right to me with a pentacle and flame.

285
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:20,920
No,cody's murder was
staged to look like wicca.

286
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:23,800
Any fool in this town would think
of it. It's obvious misdirection.

287
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,130
There's a witch in town. Duh.

288
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,810
A witch that put a killing
spell on the boy in question.

289
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,950
Exactly. It's perfect.

290
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,640
Thank you for your time.

291
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,090
Thank you.

292
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,940
Cho? Kimball cho,let's go.

293
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:55,800
Didn't want to bring her in?

294
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,550
You don't think she did this,do you?

295
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:01,430
Oh,she's deep in it somehow--
hiding something or someone.

296
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,160
I agree. I'd bring her
in, but on what charges?

297
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:06,770
She's a whack job. She
enjoys the attention.

298
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:10,170
Quicker and more effective to just
ignore her and let her come to us.

299
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:13,070
That's very astute psychology,
lisbon. I'm impressed.

300
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,880
Hey,why'd you give her my name?

301
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,200
She said i was gonna kneel before the
lord of beasts. What does that even mean?

302
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,520
What? Oh,come on.

303
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:25,080
You're not telling me you
believe she's an actual witch.

304
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,230
No,of course not.

305
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,790
But i mean, if dark forces did exist,

306
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:30,880
It stands to reason there could be people
who control them for their own ends.

307
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,320
They're called investment bankers.

308
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:34,500
They don't live around
here, i assure you.

309
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:37,250
Relax. No such thing as witches.

310
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,650
Yeah,that's easy for you to say.

311
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:44,580
Weird witch lady didn't burn you
in effigy and bind you to her power.

312
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,920
"kimball," she says, "you shall
kneel before the lord of beasts."

313
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,710
- That's scary.
- Yeah.

314
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,850
Yeah,if you're a 12-year-old
girl at her first sleepaway camp.

315
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,390
You had to be there.

316
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:09,620
Don't sweat it,man. Met this girl
in college. She said she was a witch.

317
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,730
It's not a satanic cult.
They're just nerds in cloaks.

318
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:17,010
Hey,there he is.

319
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,490
Daniel brown?

320
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,970
We've got some questions
about cody elkins.

321
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:33,660
No! Let me go!

322
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:37,210
*******

323
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,580
- Hello to beast.
- Let me see your hands.

324
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:41,010
- Let me go!
- Come on.

325
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,180
The spell was real.

326
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,420
Let's go.

327
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,430
Danactive your fight with cody elkins.

328
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:57,180
What fight? There was no fight.

329
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,770
No? He beat you unconscious
is what we heard.

330
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,230
Put you in the hospital.
We have witnesses.

331
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,910
Who?

332
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,590
- Nah,it wasn't that bad.
- T you in the hospital?

333
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,390
Yeah,for a couple of hours.

334
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,790
It was observation.

335
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,950
So why didn't you press charges?

336
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:16,370
It was a misunderstanding
between friends.

337
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,260
Nobody's fault.

338
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,100
Oh,i want to get in there.

339
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,880
Go in there.

340
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:25,050
Just... I'm just...

341
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:28,430
Or perhaps you figured you'd
take revenge more... Directly?

342
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,800
Nah.

343
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:33,780
How did the fight start, daniel?

344
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:37,320
Over at roy t. 'S place
playing cards,drinkin'.

345
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,620
His mom's in rehab.

346
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,840
So he's got the run of the place.

347
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:44,560
I did some trash-talkin'. Cody got mad.

348
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,500
We fought. He won. That's all.

349
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,780
I'm going in.

350
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:53,980
Rigsby,uh,you--
do you mind if i...

351
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:56,060
- No,do your thing,man.
- Thanks.

352
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,040
- I'm patrick. You must be...
- Daniel.

353
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:04,220
- All right,daniel?
- Yeah?

354
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:07,980
Can i keep your hand?
Thanks. Nothing strange.

355
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:10,780
I want you to breathe...

356
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:14,030
And look right here.

357
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:17,340
What did you say that angered cody?

358
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,340
It was a card game.

359
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,440
A lot of trash-talking.

360
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:26,710
So i was tripping on his family like,
"your mom's a ho. Dad's a punk bitch."

361
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,350
Keep it over here.

362
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,340
Just relax and keep it right up in here.

363
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,600
- I'm lookin' at you,man.
- Good.

364
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:37,010
Anyway,cody goes off. Bam.

365
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,120
Smashes a beer bottle over my head.

366
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,960
No warning.

367
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,640
I mean,i'm out cold, but...

368
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,830
But the guys tell me he tried
to seriously stomp me out.

369
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:49,500
And if they hadn't grabbed
him, i could be dead.

370
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:52,880
How much did the elkins
pay you for your silence?

371
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,730
- Nothing.
- Want to try that again?

372
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,110
1000.

373
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,480
You have to admit it's
uncanny. The lord of beasts?

374
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:18,870
Coincidence.

375
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:20,230
Please. What are the chances?

376
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,460
Million to one.

377
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,580
There you go.

378
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:23,830
Life is a million to one.

379
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,120
The universe is one big coincidence.

380
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:28,570
Cosmically improbable coincidences--
they happen all the time.

381
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:29,760
We just don't notice 'em.

382
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,090
Or she's a witch.

383
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,360
Or she's a witch.

384
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:38,790
Is she in
custody-- the witch?

385
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,820
No,sir.

386
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,820
Why not?

387
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:44,300
She did put a spell on your
son, like you said. You're right.

388
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:47,190
But that doesn't constitute
a criminal offense.

389
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,180
That's protected free speech.

390
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,530
So why are you here?

391
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,180
It seems cody had some violence
issues that we need to speak about.

392
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,450
No. He was a good boy.

393
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,390
Oh,we're not saying otherwise,ma'am.

394
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,640
But if he had problems with his temper,

395
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,830
That might help explain the
context leading to his death.

396
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,110
Context? In a pig's ear.

397
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,280
You're trying to blame
cody for his own death.

398
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,010
I have a question.
It's always bothered me.

399
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,030
Why do they call it football?

400
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:14,320
People don't really use
their feet much,do they?

401
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:17,850
Are you trying to be rude
or disrespectful or what?

402
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:20,220
Could i use your bathroom, please?

403
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,130
Down the hall to your left.

404
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,150
Thanks.

405
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,960
- What's his problem?
- Sorry about that.

406
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:29,940
- Do you know a boy named daniel brown?
- No.

407
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:34,080
Michael...

408
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,850
Fine.

409
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:41,610
I see where this is going.

410
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:44,240
Daniel and cody had a fight.

411
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,720
There you are.

412
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,010
Go away.

413
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:01,650
I can't. I wish i could.

414
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:04,710
It's my job to hound people
until i get the truth.

415
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:07,220
Yeah,well, uh,good luck with that.

416
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:15,920
Nice place.

417
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:19,070
Must be tough being cody
elkins' little brother.

418
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,840
No.

419
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:25,670
Well... Sometimes.

420
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,470
Me? I'd hate it.

421
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,840
He gets all the attention, the glory,
the girls flocking around-- for what?

422
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,850
For running and jumping
and catching a-a thing?

423
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,920
- Yeah, monkeys could do that.
- Yeah.

424
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,260
Monkeys could do it better.

425
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:44,260
Yeah,you know, if monkeys played football,
they would kick some serious jock butt.

426
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:51,380
All right,i admit it.

427
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:55,160
I gave daniel brown money
to,uh, to keep him quiet.

428
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:57,400
Cody has a...

429
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:01,290
Had... A real shot at a college career.

430
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:06,500
Would have been the first elkins to
have that chance, and we were so proud.

431
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,430
But you gotta understand.

432
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,330
A coach hears about
these kinds of run-ins,

433
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:16,340
And it would have ruined his
chances at one of the top schools.

434
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,550
- Had these run-ins ever
happened before? - No.

435
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,810
No,our son had no problem with violence.

436
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:24,550
It was an isolated incident.

437
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,650
Where's your friend?

438
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,380
I don't know.

439
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:35,370
How come cody killed tamzin dove's cat?

440
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,700
I-i don't know that he did that.

441
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,910
She saw him take it.

442
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:44,330
Well,look,she--she
saw what she saw,right?

443
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,230
All right? I-i don't know.

444
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:53,800
Um,if--if he
did do it...

445
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,710
You know,k-kill the cat...

446
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:02,240
- Do you think he deserved to die?
- Do you?

447
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:04,220
I'm asking you.

448
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:12,190
You don't speak to my
son without my permission.

449
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:14,500
Well,that's a little weird
and controlling,but okay.

450
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:17,420
Do you mind if i speak
to your son,mr. Elkins?

451
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:19,590
Yes,i do mind.

452
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,770
I asked. See you around,brad.

453
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:41,160
Oh,my god. Where's my food? What isthis?

454
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:43,770
That is healthy and nutritious snacking.

455
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,520
I'm gonna die.

456
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,660
Seriously, i'm allergic to carrots.

457
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:50,410
Well,i'm tired of the car
reeking like fast food.

458
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:53,390
It's like working with a caterpillar...

459
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,410
I can't even be in the same room as
a carrot. I go into anaphylactic sho--

460
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:01,740
funny.

461
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:07,260
That's enough. Rigsby,come on.

462
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:12,670
******* Look,look,look,look.
There he is. He's leaving.

463
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:25,930
Why won't this damn thing log in?

464
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,990
- Lisbon.
- *******8

465
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,710
Oh,good,van pelt. How
do i get on to the--

466
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,350
We just followed the
kid to the witch's house.

467
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,110
Is she with him?

468
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:47,580
He just went inside. They hugged.

469
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:50,700
Brad elkins is at tamzin dove's.

470
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,460
He hugged her and then went inside.

471
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,770
Interesting.

472
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:56,650
They should wait ten minutes,then go in.

473
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:57,910
Why wait?

474
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:02,740
Let the plot develop. Let the fruit
ripen. Let the yeast rise, etcetera.

475
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,700
What if he means to do her harm?

476
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:07,720
Well,if he was gonna do that,
he'd have done it by now.

477
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,440
Wait ten minutes, then go in.

478
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,850
- Okay,boss.
- Well?

479
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,640
We wait ten minutes, then we go in.

480
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:19,120
And personally,i don't
care if we wait all night.

481
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,490
Witchcraft creeps me out.

482
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:22,630
It doesn't bother me. Nerds in cloaks.

483
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,960
There's more to it than that.

484
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:27,520
Ah,it's just a silly alternative
lifestyle, like "star trek" or yoga.

485
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:29,620
I do yoga.

486
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:35,010
By blood,has he been sullied.

487
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:38,270
By blood,let him be cleansed.

488
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,110
By blood,has he been sullied.

489
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,170
By blood,let him be cleansed.

490
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,310
By blood,has he been sullied.

491
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:50,520
By blood,let him be cleansed.

492
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,530
By blood,has he been sullied.

493
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:56,500
By blood,let him be cleansed.

494
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,430
By blood,has he been sullied.

495
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,270
By blood,let him be cleansed.

496
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,500
By blood,has he been sullied.

497
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,890
By blood,let him be cleansed.

498
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,770
By blood,has he been sullied.

499
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,560
By blood,let him be cleansed.

500
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:38,250
By blood, has he been sullied.

501
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:41,210
By blood,let him be cleansed.

502
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,490
- Hear that?
- What is that?

503
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,250
By blood,let him be cleansed.

504
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:49,610
Not yoga.

505
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:52,430
Police,freeze! Everybody
stay where you are!

506
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,760
- Stay where you are!
- Everybody stay where you are!

507
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:56,480
- Drop the knife.
- Drop the knife.

508
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:57,970
Brad,we're cbi. You all right?

509
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:00,140
- Come on. Let's go. Let's go back. Let's go.
- What? No!

510
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:02,350
What--what's wrong
with you people,huh?

511
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,620
- Why can't you just leave me alone?
- Come on,brad.

512
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:06,020
Stay calm,brad.

513
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:08,150
Be patient with the ways of the cowen.

514
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,780
Everybody just stay where you are.

515
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:29,070
TAMZIN DOVE. i like it.

516
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:34,040
These files say your real name
is sarah jones from new jersey.

517
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:36,040
Your mother committed
suicide when you were 16.

518
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,580
You don't know who your father is.

519
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:39,250
You're a college dropout.

520
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:42,030
You have a history of
mild psychiatric problems,

521
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:45,840
And you served six months for
shoplifting a few years back.

522
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,530
Sarah jones is dead.

523
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:56,140
I'm tamzin dove. I am a priestess
of wicca. You can't hurt me.

524
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:58,080
Oh, i don't want to hurt you.

525
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,260
I imagine there's been enough of that.

526
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:02,060
I want to help you.

527
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:07,270
This is a murder investigation, so one
way or another, you're looking at trouble.

528
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,270
The goddess will protect me.

529
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:17,360
Tamzin,the goddess may give you solace
and hope and meaning in your life,

530
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:21,290
But she can't protect you
from those police out there.

531
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,330
Brad's been an apprentice of my
coven since last autumn equinox.

532
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,830
There's no crime in that.

533
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,950
Kind of young to be a witch,isn't it?

534
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:36,940
We're all born witch.

535
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,340
We're all born into magic.

536
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:41,810
It's taken from us as we grow up.

537
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:44,810
Interesting,if true.

538
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:49,590
How did brad's parents feel about
this new direction in his life?

539
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,160
Brad's parents just...

540
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:54,020
Really hate witches for some reason.

541
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:56,800
I mean,like, more than most.

542
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:00,870
About a month ago his mom threatened
to kill me if i ever spoke to him again.

543
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,670
But you did.

544
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:04,680
Brad came to me of his own free will.

545
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,280
He was drawn to wicca.

546
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,820
I couldn't turn him away.

547
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:10,730
How does he feel about the
spell you put on his brother?

548
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,150
He's at peace with it.

549
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:16,630
That's why we were conducting
the cleansing ritual.

550
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,690
Brad knows the difference between
the world of magic and the real world.

551
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:24,170
He understands i
didn't kill his brother.

552
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:26,900
Maybe because in the
real world, brad did it.

553
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,460
What have you got?

554
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,530
Brad's been hospitalized
twice in the last year.

555
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:35,510
Both times the accident report lists
the cause as "roughhousing with brother."

556
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,350
Think maybe brad had enough?

557
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:39,730
Everybody has a limit.

558
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,110
I have to go.

559
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,740
Me? No!

560
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:55,410
W-why would i kill my own brother?

561
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:56,980
So he would stop hurting you.

562
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:59,150
Yeah,but he never hurt me. Ever!

563
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,340
He put you in the hospital twice.

564
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:05,270
Accidents. They--they
were accidents. So?

565
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,940
So he did hurt you. It was
just--it was accidentally.

566
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:10,870
Yeah. I-i mean no.

567
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,190
Yeah.

568
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,030
He hated that you were
friends with tamzin,didn't he?

569
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:19,980
Yes.

570
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:23,600
But you never gave her up.

571
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,980
Why?

572
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,190
I feel safe there.

573
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:34,910
Sorry. Can i have a minute?

574
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:39,050
We'll be right back.

575
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,010
The parents are here. You
want me to hold 'em off?

576
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:51,080
Yeah. Wait. No.

577
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:55,030
Let brad go with them until we get
some hard evidence to bear down on them.

578
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:58,580
Yes,but let me talk to them first.

579
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,280
Please have a seat.

580
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,760
I don't see why you had to
drag him all the way down here.

581
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:19,840
We're sorry for any inconvenience.

582
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:24,160
Strange that neither of you told us
about the connection with tamzin dove.

583
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:28,070
We were...

584
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,680
Confused, to be honest with you.

585
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:32,890
We don't understand brad's
obsession with witchcraft.

586
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:36,660
We want to understand, and
we're trying, but it's...

587
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:41,540
It's disturbing and,uh,a little
embarrassing, to tell you the truth.

588
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:43,540
We're in this together,right?

589
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:45,200
We're gonna get help.

590
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:49,640
Nowadays there's,uh,therapy for
these kinds of problems,right?

591
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:51,990
We'll get through this.

592
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,760
- Have you charged that,uh,woman?
- No.

593
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:56,840
No?

594
00:34:56,850 --> 00:35:00,330
I mean,isn't it obvious
that she did it--

595
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:03,710
her, one of her
weirdo friends?I mean--

596
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:05,800
she's helping us with our inquiries.

597
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:10,980
She swears she's innocent, so we're having her
put a spell of revelation on the murder weapon.

598
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:13,900
A spell of revelation?

599
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,590
Witches have the power of telekinesis.

600
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:19,150
She says that she has a spell

601
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:23,760
which will raise the weapon from wherever
it's being concealed and reveal itself to us.

602
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:25,600
And you believe this evil crap?

603
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:27,910
Well,you never can tell.
We're gonna give it a whirl.

604
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,250
That's insane.

605
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:33,010
Her last spell seemed
to work pretty well.

606
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:36,480
How could you be so cold?

607
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:38,840
Practice.

608
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:43,450
I apologize. Brad is free to go.

609
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,650
- Let's go.
- Come on,son.

610
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,900
See you,brad.

611
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:58,070
Well,look after yourself,
and if i were you,

612
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:01,380
I'd stay very clear of
brad elkins for a while.

613
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,270
I'll do as the goddess tells me.

614
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,480
Whatever.

615
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:10,760
Oh,listen, next time you speak to her,
could you,uh, put a good word in for me?

616
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:13,580
- I will.
- Thanks.

617
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:19,270
Hey,i thought you were gonna have her
cast a spell to find the murder weapon.

618
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,640
Oh,the spell's already cast.

619
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:21,920
When did she cast it?

620
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,610
She didn't. I did.

621
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,640
You can cast spells?

622
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:29,470
Cho,there's no such thing as spells.

623
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:31,550
I know that.

624
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:36,600
He,uh,really is quite freaked out about
this witchcraft malarkey, isn't he?

625
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:38,680
Uh,yeah.

626
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:42,020
We're gonna need to work a double
shift on the stakeout tonight.

627
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:44,480
Are you at least gonna
tell me what's going on?

628
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:47,070
Oh,come on. You're telling me
you don't know what's going on?

629
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,290
You don't know who did th and why?

630
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:52,120
No, but you're gonna tell me.

631
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,520
How about i show you?

632
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:07,310
- Here we go.
- Better call cho.

633
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,810
You're not going anywhere.

634
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,830
Put it down.

635
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:42,710
This is god speaking.

636
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:45,440
You made me angry,michael.

637
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,200
Very angry.

638
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:49,410
- And you're under
arr-- - that's enough.

639
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,580
Arrest.

640
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:59,540
Amazing,isn't it?

641
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:02,360
The murder weapon revealed.

642
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:05,350
Tamzin's spells seem to work.

643
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,700
I guess she really is a witch.

644
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:09,040
I don't know what you're talking about.

645
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,460
I'm sure forensics will
confirm your son's blood

646
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:15,120
And tissue on one side of the wrench
and your fingerprints on the other.

647
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:16,990
I have no knowledge of that.

648
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:19,710
Then why were you trying to hide it?

649
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,630
Talk to us,michael.

650
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:22,920
Maybe there were circumstances.

651
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,720
Maybe you had to defend yourself.

652
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,720
I don't have to tell you anything.

653
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:31,990
What about your sons' trips to the
emergency room-- their broken bones?

654
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,570
Just clumsy,i guess.

655
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,980
Maybe a little dense at times.

656
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:39,900
Good that they had you
to keep 'em in line,huh?

657
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:43,600
Some people just don't
understand how lucky they are.

658
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:46,660
That's right.

659
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:50,590
I realized it was you when brad
said he liked going to tamzin's house

660
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:52,230
Because he felt safe there.

661
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:57,590
Safe--he feels safer at a witch's
house than they do at home.

662
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,110
You've been abusing and beating your
wife and sons for years,haven't you?

663
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:07,010
- No.
- My guess?

664
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:10,190
You were smackin' brad
around a little too much.

665
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,610
Cody wanted to protect
his brother. Was that it?

666
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,930
No.

667
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,000
"no," he says.

668
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:20,840
Your wife and son are down the
hallway, and they say no,too.

669
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:25,330
They know we caught him
throwing away the murder weapon,

670
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,430
And they still don't
believe he killed cody.

671
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:34,060
Imagine how much they love
this man to be in such denial.

672
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,980
Cody confronted you, didn't he?

673
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,570
He wouldn't put up with
your crap anymore...

674
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:41,940
******

675
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,760
Come on!

676
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,730
But you wouldn't hear of it.

677
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:59,950
He hit me.

678
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:02,760
I was defending myself.

679
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,000
Good-bye,michael.

680
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,470
Morning.

681
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:57,090
What are you doing?

682
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,740
Ah,just a little favor for cho.

683
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:26,930
Uh,tamzin dove told me to give you this.

684
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:29,500
She said to keep it in a safe place.

685
