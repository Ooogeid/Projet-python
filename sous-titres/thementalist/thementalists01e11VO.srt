7
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,445
Thank you for coming.

8
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,805
You said you had
information about red john.

9
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:38,922
Yes, I do.

10
00:01:40,442 --> 00:01:42,231
He killed your wife and daughter?

11
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,868
I've heard a lot about you.

12
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:49,650
They say you can tell
when people are lying.

13
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,027
Do you have information
about red john?

14
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:55,071
I have dynamite
information about red john.

15
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,023
Enough to catch him.

16
00:01:57,148 --> 00:01:58,817
How do you come by this information?

17
00:01:58,942 --> 00:02:00,915
Red john is a friend
of a friend of mine.

18
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,057
Is that friend of
yours in prison, too?

19
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,168
I have friends from
all walks of life.

20
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,175
Tell me.

21
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,065
I am currently doing 25 years to
life for a crime I didn't commit.

22
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,052
My last appeal just failed.

23
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:22,308
You get me out of here, and
I will give you red john.

24
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,020
You raped and murdered your
family housekeeper's daughter.

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,115
If you do know a lot about me, you
know that I'm not a real magician.

26
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,305
I didn't do it.

27
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,102
I read the case file...

28
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:36,245
The physical evidence, the
testimonies of all the witnesses,

29
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,205
Including your own
family, says you did.

30
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:39,732
I didn't kill her.

31
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,019
What happened?

32
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,614
I don't know.

33
00:02:44,434 --> 00:02:45,802
We were partying.

34
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,566
I did some blow, some meth.
We had sex. I fell asleep.

35
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,488
Then it's morning. Undine's dead.

36
00:02:54,472 --> 00:02:55,823
The cops are busting in...

37
00:02:55,948 --> 00:02:57,675
The door was locked from the inside.

38
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,668
- There were bars on the windows.
- Yes.

39
00:03:00,905 --> 00:03:02,733
How is it physically
possible that anyone

40
00:03:02,858 --> 00:03:04,518
else could've committed the murder?

41
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,805
I don't know, but I didn't.

42
00:03:07,119 --> 00:03:08,479
Ergo, someone else did.

43
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,641
Someone you can find.

44
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,555
You see me.

45
00:03:13,281 --> 00:03:14,558
Am I lying?

46
00:03:15,635 --> 00:03:17,765
You seem to be telling the truth,

47
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,044
But you're a very clever, unprincipled
narcissist In a desperate corner.

48
00:03:23,262 --> 00:03:26,288
Even if you are innocent, it doesn't
mean You have information on red john.

49
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,379
Yeah, it's a tough call.

50
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,014
I'm gonna have to say no.

51
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,901
Your wife... Red john
painted her toenails. Yes.

52
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,966
Painted them with her own blood...

53
00:03:47,658 --> 00:03:49,895
The police didn't make
that public, did they?

54
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,981
She's the only instance he did that?

55
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,935
A touch of elegance

56
00:03:55,795 --> 00:03:57,038
for you alone.

57
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,217
How do you know that?

58
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:05,739
I told you, Red john is a
friend of a friend of mine.

59
00:04:06,882 --> 00:04:08,396
What is this friend's name?

60
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:11,817
His name is "get me out
of here and i'll tell you."

61
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:13,931
That and much more.

62
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,671
I'll sing like a bird.

63
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:21,510
Okay.

64
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,760
No. I said no,

65
00:04:28,386 --> 00:04:29,596
and I mean no.

66
00:04:30,973 --> 00:04:33,510
It's not that I don't want to
help you. I want to help you.

67
00:04:33,635 --> 00:04:36,150
It's just... It's not
physically possible.

68
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:39,069
Jared renfrew was tried and
convicted. It's a closed case.

69
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,474
I have no authority To
reopen it witho cause.

70
00:04:42,773 --> 00:04:44,700
- There is cause.
- For you, there's cause.

71
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,921
Not for the state of california.

72
00:04:47,144 --> 00:04:48,229
We can't touch it.

73
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:52,095
- But we could touch it if...
- Closed case. Nothing to be done.

74
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,910
The justice department
doesn't go about...

75
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,530
Undoing its own work.

76
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,086
I understand.

77
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,114
No problem.

78
00:05:05,585 --> 00:05:07,615
If we can't touch
it, we can't touch it.

79
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,382
- I'm sorry.
- No.

80
00:05:10,905 --> 00:05:12,349
The law's the law.

81
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:17,313
My desire for revenge
doesn't outweigh the rules.

82
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,920
I have to accept that.

83
00:05:22,609 --> 00:05:25,008
- I'm glad you understand.
- Thanks for your time.

84
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,911
He's lying through
his teeth, isn't he?

85
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,223
Yes.

86
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:36,855
Jane.

87
00:05:37,313 --> 00:05:39,086
I know better
than to try and stop you

88
00:05:39,211 --> 00:05:41,077
From doing what you
think you have to do.

89
00:05:41,202 --> 00:05:42,884
No, i-I'm fine about it.

90
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,515
I can see minelli's point.

91
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,179
I can't be chasing every
nutbag with a good story, can i?

92
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,020
Yeah. Sure, you're fine with it.

93
00:05:49,145 --> 00:05:51,070
Just do me the favor
of listening to me for

94
00:05:51,195 --> 00:05:53,185
a minute,
So I can say "i told you so" later.

95
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:54,154
Sure.

96
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,758
Jared renfrew was found
hugging the corpse

97
00:05:56,883 --> 00:05:59,395
of undine kopecki in a room
locked from the inside,

98
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,456
Holding a bloody butcher
knife in his hand.

99
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:03,001
His semen was inside of her.

100
00:06:03,126 --> 00:06:05,085
He had been stalking her for weeks.

101
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:07,590
He's got a history of
violence going back 15 years.

102
00:06:07,715 --> 00:06:08,858
What's your point?

103
00:06:08,983 --> 00:06:10,995
He's guilty. You're being conned.

104
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,175
Possible, but I don't think so.

105
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,116
I gotta find out one
way or the other.

106
00:06:16,241 --> 00:06:18,352
Even if he's telling
the truth about the murder,

107
00:06:18,477 --> 00:06:20,275
he could still be
lying about red john.

108
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,393
Also possible.

109
00:06:21,518 --> 00:06:23,825
But I gotta take the
chance. What else can I do?

110
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,785
Minelli wants me to
keep a watch on you.

111
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,500
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm not gonna follow you around.

112
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:29,706
Let's compromise.

113
00:06:29,831 --> 00:06:31,821
When you get into trouble,
call me first.

114
00:06:31,946 --> 00:06:34,101
- So I can try and minimize the damage.
- Deal.

115
00:06:34,772 --> 00:06:36,374
And don't use your cbi card.

116
00:06:36,499 --> 00:06:39,379
If the bureau finds out you used it
without authorization, you're done.

117
00:06:39,504 --> 00:06:40,664
I hear you.

118
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:54,775
Hello?

119
00:06:55,469 --> 00:06:56,905
My name's patrick jane.

120
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:59,793
I'd like to speak to gardner
renfrew about his brother jared.

121
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,400
One moment, please.

122
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,552
Mr. Renfrew says,"no, thank you."

123
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,597
Tell mr. Renfrew I can prove
his brother is innocent,

124
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,327
And I know who really
committed the murder.

125
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,011
Thank you very much.

126
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,717
Is that your father?

127
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,164
Yes.

128
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,695
What's this all about, mr. Jane?

129
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,473
Who are you, and what
do you mean by this?

130
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,802
Do you think
your brother is innocent?

131
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,509
You said you could
prove he's innocent.

132
00:07:54,634 --> 00:07:56,319
You said you know who really did it.

133
00:07:56,444 --> 00:07:59,155
No. Just... That was just
to get inside the house.

134
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,395
I have no idea
who might have done it.

135
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,149
It might've been jared.
I hope not.

136
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,652
He seems to be telling the
truth. What do you think?

137
00:08:07,365 --> 00:08:10,205
I think you had better
leave right now, mr. Jane.

138
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,991
I don't have the... The time
or the patience for tomfoolery.

139
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,995
So you think he's guilty?
I'm wasting my time.

140
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,271
We're done talking.

141
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:19,975
Suppose I could prove he was
innocent. Wouldn't you want that?

142
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,270
Wouldn't you want that
blot on your name expunged?

143
00:08:22,395 --> 00:08:23,530
Of course he would.

144
00:08:23,655 --> 00:08:26,925
Nothing would make me
happier, but my brother's guilty.

145
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:30,300
He violated that poor girl. He violated
this house. He violated this family.

146
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,595
That's all I needed to know.

147
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,306
Thank you for your time.

148
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:37,792
Your, mother lives here in
the guesthouse, doesn't she?

149
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,351
You leave my mother alone.

150
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,663
Well, that's not
your call to make, is it?

151
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:43,170
Breck, call the police.

152
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,164
Be sure and tell 'em I'm unarmed.

153
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,910
Go inside, mother! Go inside!

154
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,425
My name's patrick jane. I want to
speak to you about your son jared.

155
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:04,412
I'll deal with him, mother. The police
are on their way. Just go inside.

156
00:09:04,537 --> 00:09:07,516
Don't order me about, and
don't be so hysterical.

157
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,760
What's your interest in jared?

158
00:09:10,885 --> 00:09:13,902
I'm a friend of his, trying
to prove his innocence.

159
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,113
- Come and sit down.
- Thank you.

160
00:09:19,238 --> 00:09:20,775
Mother, you're being childish.

161
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,980
Go away, gardner.

162
00:09:22,105 --> 00:09:23,743
- Mother!
- Go away!

163
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:31,069
Tell me why you wish to
prove my son's innocence.

164
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:34,655
I can promise you I'm not
up to anything sinister, ma'am.

165
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,116
My motives are pure.

166
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,790
Tell me about jared.

167
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,004
He was a troubled child,

168
00:09:41,129 --> 00:09:42,948
charming and bright, but...

169
00:09:43,273 --> 00:09:44,583
a bully and a liar.

170
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,145
Something of a sadist.

171
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:48,295
Qualities you rather
liked in him, I expect.

172
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,540
Yes, I did.

173
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,488
I found him rather amusing...
At first.

174
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,803
One doesn't want a wimp for a son.

175
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,038
But there must be
a sense of proportion

176
00:10:01,163 --> 00:10:02,423
and moderation.

177
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,353
As he got older, he got worse.

178
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,328
Got in with bad people.

179
00:10:06,453 --> 00:10:08,899
It was one scandal after another.
In and out of prison.

180
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:10,155
A common criminal.

181
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,108
But he turned himself
around, didn't he?

182
00:10:12,233 --> 00:10:15,329
He gave up the drink and the
drugs and the gallivanting,

183
00:10:15,454 --> 00:10:16,843
Made peace with his brother

184
00:10:16,968 --> 00:10:19,151
and came home to help run
the family businesses.

185
00:10:19,276 --> 00:10:21,036
- The prodigal son.
- Yes.

186
00:10:22,558 --> 00:10:24,994
George, his father, was overjoyed.

187
00:10:26,456 --> 00:10:27,591
I was skeptical.

188
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,703
Pleased, of course, but skeptical.

189
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,339
As my mother always
said,"you are what you are."

190
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,576
- I guess she's right.
- Yes.

191
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,947
Poor george dropped dead
a week after the murder.

192
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:40,716
Broke his heart, people said.

193
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:43,475
George didn't really have
a heart, in that sense.

194
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,695
He died of embarrassment.

195
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:49,190
A renfrew in the pokey
for murder. Quelle horreur.

196
00:10:49,862 --> 00:10:51,858
Can you show me where it happened?

197
00:10:52,264 --> 00:10:53,624
Who else was in the house?

198
00:10:53,749 --> 00:10:57,550
I had a small dinner party,
Probably ten people all told.

199
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,686
After they left, it
was just family...

200
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,538
Gardner and breck, george
and i and jared, of course.

201
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:06,305
Not mariska the housekeeper?

202
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,041
No, she lived out.

203
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:14,636
Undine was only here to help
the cook with the dinner party.

204
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:21,388
She was a lovely girl.
Full of life and promise.

205
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,350
Her mother and mariska had
been with us 20 years...

206
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,365
Part of the family.

207
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:30,524
Jared told me that he and
undine were having an affair,

208
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:32,543
That he loved her and
he'd never hurt her.

209
00:11:32,668 --> 00:11:34,720
She told her mother
that he was stalking her,

210
00:11:34,845 --> 00:11:36,289
that she was scared of him.

211
00:11:36,414 --> 00:11:38,989
She didn't go to the police
out of respect for the family.

212
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:40,959
I'd like to speak to her mother.

213
00:11:41,084 --> 00:11:42,837
She left our employ, I'm afraid.

214
00:11:43,229 --> 00:11:45,584
It was too difficult,
for both of us.

215
00:11:46,096 --> 00:11:47,175
Where is she now?

216
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,887
I have an address somewhere.

217
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:54,113
Can you get it for me now?

218
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,495
- As you wish.
- Thank you.

219
00:12:28,043 --> 00:12:30,465
- Sir, would you come with us?
- Why?

220
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,590
- You're trespassing here.
- No, I'm not.

221
00:12:32,715 --> 00:12:34,800
Okay, sir, this man here
says he's the homeowner

222
00:12:34,925 --> 00:12:37,505
And says you're trespassing, so
let's go, partner.

223
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:40,170
Officer, it's the other way
around. I'm the homeowner.

224
00:12:40,295 --> 00:12:44,054
- That man is the intruder.
- Well, that's a lie! He... he's lying!

225
00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:45,865
Listen to the madness in his voice.

226
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:48,337
Will you please take him
somewhere he can get some help?

227
00:12:48,462 --> 00:12:51,017
Here you are. I don't know that
she'll still be there, but...

228
00:12:51,142 --> 00:12:52,228
Thank you so much.

229
00:12:52,353 --> 00:12:54,589
For heaven's sake, gardner.
Policemen?

230
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,442
How ridiculous. Send them away.

231
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,175
Ma'am, this man here is...

232
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,136
Yes, yes,
it's quite all right, officer.

233
00:13:01,261 --> 00:13:02,244
You can go.

234
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,418
Thanks.

235
00:13:09,627 --> 00:13:11,075
Well, good-bye, mrs. Renfrew.

236
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,936
I expect we'll speak again soon.

237
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,502
Good day to you.

238
00:13:15,756 --> 00:13:17,617
Gardner renfrew is a
player in this town.

239
00:13:17,742 --> 00:13:19,953
You can't go to his house
and screw around with him.

240
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:21,935
Why not? It's a free country.

241
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,655
I didn't use my I. D.
I didn't even mention the cbi.

242
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,686
- You gave your real name.
- It's my name.

243
00:13:26,811 --> 00:13:28,845
Well, you should've
lied as you so often do,

244
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:31,195
Because now I have to give
you an official reprimand

245
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,438
And order you in the strongest possible
terms to leave the renfrew family alone

246
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:36,905
- And... and drop the matter.
- Sorry, can't do that.

247
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,693
You have to. This is straight
from the A. G.'s office.

248
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:41,685
Jared renfrew didn't
kill undine kopecki.

249
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:43,721
- Do you have evidence of that?
- Not yet.

250
00:13:43,846 --> 00:13:45,783
I have pieces... That
I'm piecing together.

251
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:46,984
He's innocent.

252
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,245
Wake up, dorothy. You're
not in kansas anymore.

253
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:53,205
There are innocent men
in jail. It happens.

254
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:55,350
Is he one of them? I
don't know. I doubt it.

255
00:13:55,475 --> 00:13:56,566
In any case,

256
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,395
we can't reopen his case.

257
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,464
If I'm dorothy, then who are you?

258
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,005
It doesn't matter who I am.

259
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:07,135
We will find other ways of
making renfrew talk to you.

260
00:14:07,754 --> 00:14:11,371
There is a lot that can be done
to make a prisoner's life easier,

261
00:14:11,496 --> 00:14:13,390
- If he cooperates.
- It's not gonna work.

262
00:14:13,515 --> 00:14:15,437
- He's innocent.
- Okay, here it is.

263
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:18,688
If you pursue this any further,

264
00:14:18,813 --> 00:14:20,932
I'm gonna have to throw
you out of the cbi.

265
00:14:21,057 --> 00:14:23,064
We can't take the liability.

266
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,906
I very much do not
want to have to do that.

267
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,464
I know you don't.

268
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:38,224
So...

269
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:42,714
Well, i'll spare
you the trouble. I quit.

270
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:46,218
- Don't do that.
- Oh, it's okay. It's best this way.

271
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,429
You are the good witch
glinda, obviously.

272
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,393
Thank you.

273
00:14:55,598 --> 00:14:56,645
I learned a lot.

274
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,073
<i>CBI HQ Sacramento, CA</i>

275
00:15:12,603 --> 00:15:15,632
Don't bother, I know. I feel the
same way. Nothing to be done.

276
00:15:15,757 --> 00:15:18,269
So now when he really needs our
help, We're letting him down.

277
00:15:18,394 --> 00:15:20,228
I wanna help him just
as much as you do.

278
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:23,630
Our orders state that we
must stay away from this case.

279
00:15:23,948 --> 00:15:26,085
I don't care what our
orders say. It's not right.

280
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:29,075
We closed cases before he came.
We'll close cases after he's gone.

281
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,259
Just not so many.

282
00:15:30,384 --> 00:15:33,113
The cases are not the point. It's
not that we need him. He needs us.

283
00:15:33,238 --> 00:15:35,459
He needs us on a fool's
errand. Renfrew's a con man.

284
00:15:35,584 --> 00:15:37,478
He doesn't know
anything about red john.

285
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,095
Suppose we found a connection
between renfrew and red john.

286
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,213
It would...

287
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,614
Wait.

288
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,320
What's in the file? Let me guess...

289
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,541
A connection between
renfrew and red john?

290
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:51,616
Seven years ago, Renfrew was serving
time on a narcotics conviction.

291
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:55,825
He shared a cell in lompoc with
a man by the name of orval tanner.

292
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:58,529
Tanner claimed in his
1998 trial for murder.

293
00:15:58,654 --> 00:16:00,325
That he had only been an accomplice,

294
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,975
That the real killer was a
man by the name of red john.

295
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,395
Nobody believed him.

296
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,916
'98. That's the beginning
of red john's career.

297
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,535
Where's tanner now?

298
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,680
He died of heart disease
in a prison hospital.

299
00:16:10,805 --> 00:16:12,880
- Of course, our luck.
- It's a connection.

300
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:15,599
Slim. Likely, nobody
believed him for a reason.

301
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:17,099
But it's a connection.

302
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,161
Okay.

303
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,110
Check out tanner's background, find
the autopsy reports,

304
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:28,028
See if there's any
credibility to his story.

305
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,705
I mean, obviously, we can't do that,

306
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:33,182
But that's what
I would tell you to do.

307
00:16:33,307 --> 00:16:36,320
If we weren't ordered to
stay away from this case.

308
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:43,454
Okay, then let me speak To the
assistant to the deputy records officer.

309
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,225
Why do people say "eureka"
when they do something good?

310
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,166
It's, greek for "bingo."

311
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,497
Well, so... Eureka.

312
00:16:52,254 --> 00:16:56,084
I found the autopsy reports, And
they back up orval tanner's story.

313
00:16:56,209 --> 00:16:58,850
The body of the alleged
victim... Cut up, red john style.

314
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,166
Which means renfrew's
telling some kind of truth

315
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:03,396
- about his red john connection.
- Yep.

316
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,660
Van pelt.
What's that you're working on?

317
00:17:12,785 --> 00:17:15,225
- Sir, I asked her to...
- I'm talking to van pelt.

318
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:19,831
Sir...

319
00:17:20,432 --> 00:17:22,457
I'm doing research
for jane. No excuses, sir.

320
00:17:24,831 --> 00:17:26,058
You, too, I suppose.

321
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:30,005
Hey, boss.

322
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:32,040
I gave this unit a direct,
written order.

323
00:17:32,165 --> 00:17:34,192
And they have flagrantly
disobeyed that order.

324
00:17:34,317 --> 00:17:36,203
Did they do that with
your knowledge?

325
00:17:36,721 --> 00:17:38,014
I ordered them to do it.

326
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,623
I told them you countermanded
your earlier order.

327
00:17:40,748 --> 00:17:42,492
They had no knowledge whatsoever.

328
00:17:42,617 --> 00:17:44,500
That they were doing
anything irregular.

329
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:47,007
Nice try, mother teresa. They
already gave themselves up.

330
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:48,400
We never said a word...

331
00:17:50,582 --> 00:17:52,176
I stand by my story.

332
00:17:52,376 --> 00:17:54,496
They didn't know
they were out of line.

333
00:17:54,838 --> 00:17:57,690
Sir, the opposite is true. We forced
agent lisbon to let us do this.

334
00:17:57,815 --> 00:17:58,785
Very touching.

335
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,038
My ex-wife would love
this scene in a movie.

336
00:18:03,994 --> 00:18:05,575
I'm giving you all formal notice.

337
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,129
Any further infractions will
result in immediate suspension.

338
00:18:09,468 --> 00:18:10,358
Sir...

339
00:18:10,746 --> 00:18:12,406
You might as well suspend me now,

340
00:18:12,531 --> 00:18:14,680
because there will be
further infractions.

341
00:18:14,805 --> 00:18:16,816
Jane needs our help, and
he's gonna get it.

342
00:18:16,941 --> 00:18:18,129
I'm not gonna lay off

343
00:18:18,254 --> 00:18:20,316
because some fat cat's
putting on the pressure.

344
00:18:20,441 --> 00:18:22,177
- Me, too.
- And me.

345
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:27,108
Moving, eloquent, two thumbs up.

346
00:18:30,173 --> 00:18:32,235
You shall have your
wish. You're all suspended,

347
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,957
Starting right now, For
gross insubordination.

348
00:18:41,665 --> 00:18:42,579
I'm sorry.

349
00:18:51,473 --> 00:18:52,213
Lisbon.

350
00:18:52,667 --> 00:18:53,548
Still here?

351
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:58,075
That was more of a rhetorical
stand we were taking back there.

352
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,429
You take it back then.

353
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,283
Well, no, but I wanted to talk to...

354
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:02,727
This... The...

355
00:19:03,565 --> 00:19:05,690
The suspension paperwork right here.

356
00:19:05,815 --> 00:19:06,605
Look...

357
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:10,315
I have to go and visit my sister
in hawaii for a week. She's sick.

358
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,610
Meanwhile,
this paperwork is gonna sit on my desk.

359
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:16,488
For a week, is that clear?

360
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,226
- One week.
- Yes, sir.

361
00:19:19,351 --> 00:19:20,759
- Yes...
- Thank you.

362
00:19:20,884 --> 00:19:22,369
Be very grateful.

363
00:19:23,145 --> 00:19:26,082
Do not contact me.
I do not want to know anything.

364
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:27,128
And please...

365
00:19:27,253 --> 00:19:29,123
Do not dig the hole
that you are standing

366
00:19:29,248 --> 00:19:31,184
in any deeper than you
have already dug it.

367
00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:32,077
No, sir.

368
00:19:32,202 --> 00:19:34,464
That hole is the grave of
your very promising career.

369
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:38,467
You should put
a flashlight underneath

370
00:19:38,592 --> 00:19:40,428
your chin just to
complete the effect.

371
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:41,679
I'm not kidding.

372
00:19:42,143 --> 00:19:42,894
I know.

373
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,085
Hey, lisbon.

374
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:19,764
Oh, yeah, I'm fine. Just...

375
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,974
Out investigating stuff.

376
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:27,989
Sure.

377
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:29,908
Yeah.

378
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:32,730
Pepperoni or plain?

379
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,318
Okay.

380
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,468
Hey, lisbon...

381
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,392
Thank you.

382
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:46,362
Renfrew couldn't dispute
the physical evidence.

383
00:20:46,762 --> 00:20:49,369
The core of his defense was
that he loved undine deeply

384
00:20:49,494 --> 00:20:51,295
and he would never hurt her.

385
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,655
Undine's mother
testified that was a lie.

386
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,125
I went to go speak with her,
but she moved,

387
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,169
left no forwarding address.

388
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,325
- Mariska kopecki, right?
- Yeah.

389
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:01,805
How does the brother look?

390
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:05,480
He had motive. There's a moral
turpitude clause in the family trust.

391
00:21:05,605 --> 00:21:08,766
Once convicted, all jared's shares In
the family business went to gardner.

392
00:21:09,138 --> 00:21:11,436
But he would've also got
the shares if jared had died.

393
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,646
So why not just kill
jared? Why kill undine?

394
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,279
Exactly.

395
00:21:15,755 --> 00:21:16,900
Why kill undine?

396
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:20,069
He wanted to see jared suffer maybe
Or had a thing for undine himself.

397
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,550
Eureka.

398
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:26,215
I input mariska kopecki into
the secure search engine.

399
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,676
I get an i. M. link

400
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:31,707
to a health care database that documents
mariska kopecki's notification

401
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:34,417
That she's changing her
name to vanna clooney.

402
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:36,377
I input the new name and get a hit.

403
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:40,590
Four months ago, someone named v. K.
Clooney Bought a condo in marin.

404
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,090
Nice work.

405
00:21:42,405 --> 00:21:43,894
Yeah, weird thing, though...

406
00:21:44,019 --> 00:21:46,352
The original i. M.
Came from a civilian.

407
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,103
A dr. Joe in new hampshire.

408
00:21:49,585 --> 00:21:52,235
He couldn't have been logged
on to the d. O. j. Secure network.

409
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,306
So how did he know
what i was asking about?

410
00:21:54,431 --> 00:21:56,740
And how did he have access
to the health care database?

411
00:21:56,865 --> 00:21:58,275
Nobody's allowed to do that.

412
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,404
When you say "dr. Joe in new
hampshire," Do you mean d-r-j-o-e-n-h...

413
00:22:04,269 --> 00:22:05,012
Yeah.

414
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,159
Oh, my god.

415
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,630
Oh, my god.

416
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,740
Ask,"who are you?"

417
00:22:17,986 --> 00:22:19,045
<i>Is Jane there?</i>

418
00:22:19,366 --> 00:22:20,088
Yes.

419
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,784
<i>This is Jane.</i>

420
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:28,932
"Keep up the good work."

421
00:22:32,052 --> 00:22:32,786
<i>Why?</i>

422
00:22:37,864 --> 00:22:39,065
<i>I.M. source locator</i>

423
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:42,475
He's gone.

424
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,532
What the hell was that about?

425
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,245
He somehow tapped into
the d. O. j. Secure network.

426
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,021
He's been spying on us.

427
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,203
Can we find the source of the i. M.?

428
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,725
There's a self-destruct
code built into the uplink.

429
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,605
It dead-ends at
the secondary server.

430
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:01,275
There's no way to trace it back.

431
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,011
He wants us to succeed.

432
00:23:03,362 --> 00:23:04,798
He wants renfrew out of jail.

433
00:23:04,923 --> 00:23:06,993
Out where he can get
at him... to silence him.

434
00:23:07,118 --> 00:23:09,415
Yes. Which means renfrew
is telling the truth.

435
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,411
Which means he has
the goods on red john.

436
00:23:11,536 --> 00:23:13,350
Slow down.
We don't have anything yet.

437
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,714
Yes, we still have to get
renfrew out of jail first.

438
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:16,832
Oh, that's all.

439
00:23:16,957 --> 00:23:19,505
And we will, and then red
john will go after him.

440
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:21,441
He has to break cover. He has to.

441
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:25,069
And we will waiting for him.

442
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,592
Damn.

443
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,877
How are you gonna get us in
there without your magic badge?

444
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:41,565
- You do the talking.
- No, you try.

445
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:43,745
Don't be childish. I'm not...

446
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:46,507
I thought it was harry.
Who are you?

447
00:23:47,154 --> 00:23:48,926
- Vanna clooney?
- Yes.

448
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:52,188
- I'm teresa, and this is patrick.
- Yes.

449
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:54,974
Can... can we come in for a moment?

450
00:23:55,303 --> 00:23:56,488
What do you want?

451
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:02,027
- It's to do with harry.
- What about him?

452
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:04,567
Well, it's best not to
speak out here in public.

453
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,248
Okay, i lied just now.

454
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:14,300
We're here to talk about
your daughter undine.

455
00:24:14,425 --> 00:24:16,454
- Get out.
- Sit down.

456
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:23,725
Who are you?

457
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:24,849
Listen to me,

458
00:24:25,162 --> 00:24:27,812
or your guilt and pain
and shame won't ever go away.

459
00:24:27,937 --> 00:24:29,832
It won't go away until
you tell the truth.

460
00:24:29,957 --> 00:24:31,930
What truth? What, are you crazy?

461
00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:34,083
You don't know me. You
don't know what i feel.

462
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:35,201
I do know you.

463
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:38,304
When you first came to this
country as a young woman,

464
00:24:38,429 --> 00:24:40,228
you dreamed of such great things,

465
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,275
What a life you'd have.

466
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,015
And what did fate bring you?

467
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,765
25 years of drudgery, a
servant's life.

468
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:48,611
You hated every day of it.

469
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:51,375
Who wants to be a servant? Nobody.

470
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,665
You did it for her, for undine.

471
00:24:53,945 --> 00:24:55,948
So that she would
have a better life.

472
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,817
- Yes.
- And then she was gone,

473
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:00,775
taken from you.

474
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,016
In a flash,

475
00:25:02,337 --> 00:25:03,510
your whole life...

476
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:07,255
All those days of drudgery
and humiliation... Wasted.

477
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:08,829
What a joke?

478
00:25:09,855 --> 00:25:10,639
Yes.

479
00:25:10,994 --> 00:25:11,950
A joke.

480
00:25:15,667 --> 00:25:16,975
What do you want from me?

481
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,589
I want to know who killed her.

482
00:25:18,714 --> 00:25:20,768
What's it matter who
killed her? She's gone.

483
00:25:20,893 --> 00:25:23,396
Well, you didn't say jared. That
would be the obvious answer.

484
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:25,505
Okay. Jared killed her.
I don't care.

485
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:26,590
It's true.

486
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:29,175
There's nothing you can do
that will bring her back.

487
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,321
So if you get paid to lie about what
happened, then, where's the harm?

488
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,859
What paid?

489
00:25:34,393 --> 00:25:35,867
Nobody paid me anything.

490
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:38,263
Don't lie to me. Tell me the truth.

491
00:25:38,482 --> 00:25:40,076
You took your 20 pieces of silver

492
00:25:40,201 --> 00:25:42,363
and bought the life you always wanted,
didn't you?

493
00:25:42,488 --> 00:25:44,737
- No.
- It's what you always wanted.

494
00:25:45,538 --> 00:25:47,170
- It means nothing.
- Jane.

495
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:50,540
Look at me, mariska. Look at
me, And tell me i'm wrong.

496
00:25:50,665 --> 00:25:53,300
You think you know
everything! You know nothing!

497
00:25:53,425 --> 00:25:55,928
I know that jared and undine
were lovers, weren't they?

498
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:58,383
And you were paid to
say that they weren't.

499
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:01,392
Say it out loud.

500
00:26:03,971 --> 00:26:04,690
Yes.

501
00:26:06,259 --> 00:26:07,352
They were lovers.

502
00:26:07,477 --> 00:26:09,363
Who paid you to say
that they weren't?

503
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,115
I don't know.

504
00:26:13,024 --> 00:26:16,105
A what you call a...
A private investigator.

505
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:18,655
He came to me, and he
offered me a lot of money.

506
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,712
A lot of money! But i said no.

507
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,389
He offered more.

508
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,341
- I took it.
- What was his name?

509
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,647
Samsa.

510
00:26:36,707 --> 00:26:37,842
Austin samsa.

511
00:26:38,792 --> 00:26:39,877
Okay, cho,

512
00:26:40,002 --> 00:26:41,078
thank you.

513
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:43,601
- Austin Samsa's dead.
- What?

514
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,478
- Hit by a bus.
- Damn.

515
00:26:45,754 --> 00:26:47,755
We could get a court
order for his records.

516
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,765
Remember, you're on suspension.

517
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:52,693
If we don't get this closed up
before minelli gets back, We're done.

518
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,505
- Plan "B" then.
- What's plan "B"?

519
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,533
Well, you're not gonna like it.

520
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,624
We need to speak with
your husband, ma'am.

521
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,361
Who's the agent in charge here?

522
00:27:08,486 --> 00:27:10,375
I'm agent lisbon.
This is agent rigsby.

523
00:27:10,607 --> 00:27:12,835
And i believe you've met
my colleague patrick jane.

524
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,714
Hello.

525
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,915
I expect you're wondering
why i gathered you all here?

526
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,387
- Breck, go call the police.
- Mr. Renfrew, wait.

527
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:23,649
Unless you want your family ruined
In a deluge of sordid scandal,

528
00:27:23,946 --> 00:27:26,579
- You might want to listen to me.
- What are you talking about?

529
00:27:26,704 --> 00:27:27,601
Someone,

530
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:29,072
i don't know who,

531
00:27:29,197 --> 00:27:32,755
paid mariska kopecki a lot of money
to lie about jared and undine.

532
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,145
They were lovers, as
your brother said.

533
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,302
So what?

534
00:27:36,427 --> 00:27:38,515
The fact is,
they were found in a locked room.

535
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,922
It's not physically possible For
someone to have gotten into the room

536
00:27:42,047 --> 00:27:43,238
to commit the murder.

537
00:27:43,363 --> 00:27:44,072
Yes,

538
00:27:44,197 --> 00:27:46,826
there's the rub.
The key was in the door.

539
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:48,397
Watch closely.

540
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:55,213
Rigsby.

541
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,384
Would you please go
inside and lock the door?

542
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:06,434
Suppose jared and undine
are inside sleeping.

543
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,264
It's all very clever, but
how do you get out again?

544
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,574
Can i borrow your lighter, please?

545
00:29:04,912 --> 00:29:05,797
Thank you.

546
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,040
And that is how jared was framed.

547
00:29:11,631 --> 00:29:13,843
- Cool?
- It doesn't mean jared's innocent.

548
00:29:13,968 --> 00:29:16,338
And it certainly doesn't
mean someone else is guilty.

549
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:19,960
- It's a party trick.
- A party trick a jury will love.

550
00:29:20,085 --> 00:29:22,695
Put that together with
mariska's testimony,

551
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:26,295
and i think we have a pretty good
chance of winning a new trial.

552
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,839
Then the truth will come
out somehow.

553
00:29:29,281 --> 00:29:30,226
Unless...

554
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,644
Unless what?

555
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,495
Unless we can make some
kind of financial deal here

556
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,882
That would make it worth
our while Dropping all this.

557
00:29:39,007 --> 00:29:40,818
You want money?
You're blackmailing us.

558
00:29:41,325 --> 00:29:43,545
- We call it leverage.
- But you're state agents.

559
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:45,825
Ex-state agents. Thanks
to your son here,

560
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:48,070
Jane was tossed out, and
we're going with him.

561
00:29:48,195 --> 00:29:49,918
We need to look after ourselves now.

562
00:29:50,043 --> 00:29:51,414
We won't be unreasonable.

563
00:29:51,582 --> 00:29:53,640
You people are a disgrace.

564
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:56,585
- Get out.
- We're going.

565
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:59,862
We'll give you until 4:00
to call us with an offer.

566
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:03,267
After that, we're gonna
make some calls of our own.

567
00:30:04,072 --> 00:30:07,012
I'll tell you who i'm
calling. I'm calling the fbi!

568
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:13,978
Am i wrong, Or did that go
down not quite as you'd hoped?

569
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:17,835
I've had better responses, but
i think we made a sale.

570
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,109
- You never can tell.
- We're doomed.

571
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:24,518
Patience.

572
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,769
Patience.

573
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,205
Patience.

574
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:36,568
If you say "patience"
one more time...

575
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:55,269
Hello?

576
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,402
I'll be right there.

577
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,208
Who was it?

578
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,238
I confess,

579
00:31:10,476 --> 00:31:12,305
I thought it'd
be gardner who called me.

580
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:13,330
Gardner?

581
00:31:14,232 --> 00:31:15,498
He hasn't the gumption.

582
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,335
I will not see our family name
dragged through the mud again.

583
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:21,602
How much do you want to keep quiet?

584
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:25,081
How much did you give mariska?

585
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,525
I don't say i paid her anything.

586
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:28,985
You needn't be evasive.

587
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:32,759
Only a guilty person would respond
this way to such naked extortion.

588
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:34,994
I know you're guilty.

589
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,061
I'm just not sure why.

590
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:40,415
Your suspicions are
neither here nor there.

591
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,857
I asked you your price.

592
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,459
Your late husband
was a handsome man.

593
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:47,465
Yes, he was. What's
that got to do with it?

594
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:50,282
Domineering, though. Had
to have things his way.

595
00:31:50,614 --> 00:31:52,395
He died how long after the murder?

596
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,300
A week.

597
00:31:53,425 --> 00:31:54,556
Aortic aneurysm.

598
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:59,625
And mariska... She
left your employ when?

599
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,961
At the same time.

600
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:03,457
After he died, though.

601
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:05,438
Yes.

602
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:10,131
May i?

603
00:32:10,819 --> 00:32:11,816
Thank you.

604
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:17,380
So you got rid of her as soon
as you could after he died,

605
00:32:17,505 --> 00:32:18,910
Because undine

606
00:32:19,853 --> 00:32:21,313
was your husband's child,

607
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:22,966
Wasn't she?

608
00:32:29,995 --> 00:32:30,708
Yes.

609
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,141
And you never confronted
him or mariska?

610
00:32:35,266 --> 00:32:35,989
No.

611
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,643
I decided i liked my life as it was.

612
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:44,420
I didn't want a drama, and
i didn't want to be lied to.

613
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:47,065
They never knew i suspected.

614
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:48,980
18 years of secret anger.

615
00:32:50,346 --> 00:32:51,857
How did you stand it?

616
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:54,832
Nobody's life is perfect.

617
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,575
And then when you found out
about undine and jared's affair,

618
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,215
you must've been enraged.

619
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,636
It's practically incest.

620
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:02,737
It is.

621
00:33:03,939 --> 00:33:05,091
It is incest.

622
00:33:07,727 --> 00:33:09,084
When i found out, I...

623
00:33:09,413 --> 00:33:11,955
I told jared that he was
not to continue the affair.

624
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,227
He refused...

625
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,848
Said he was in love with her.

626
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,855
He refused to stop seeing her.

627
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,805
Didn't you tell him
why you objected?

628
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:22,163
Certainly not.

629
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:25,302
I couldn't tell him.

630
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,713
It was too sordid,

631
00:33:29,075 --> 00:33:30,202
too humiliating.

632
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,713
Instead, you killed undine,
paid off her mother

633
00:33:32,838 --> 00:33:35,082
and sent your son to jail for life.

634
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:36,931
No.

635
00:33:37,825 --> 00:33:38,974
I wouldn't do that.

636
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:50,126
Undine's blood.

637
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,251
It's proof... I did it.

638
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:33,254
I took it so i could confess
And get jared freed when i chose.

639
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,866
- Just as soon as he learned his lesson.
- What lesson?

640
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,605
Everything in moderation.

641
00:34:42,381 --> 00:34:43,205
And...

642
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:48,512
- Listen to your mother.
- Can't argue with that.

643
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,149
<i>Two Week Later</i>

644
00:34:56,410 --> 00:34:57,691
- good?
- Yep.

645
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,341
Okay.

646
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,735
We're ready to go get renfrew.

647
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,811
- Is the safe house all set up?
- Yeah.

648
00:35:06,461 --> 00:35:07,461
Good.

649
00:35:08,489 --> 00:35:10,249
I guess i'll see
you over there later.

650
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:12,210
Jane, please be careful.

651
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:15,200
Remember, this is playing out
just like red john wants it to.

652
00:35:15,325 --> 00:35:17,156
This is playing out
just like it has to.

653
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,443
He has no choice but to
try and silence renfrew.

654
00:35:19,568 --> 00:35:20,945
He has to show himself.

655
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,870
We're getting close. I can feel it.

656
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,443
You can feel it.

657
00:35:24,756 --> 00:35:26,734
- Like a psychic thing?
- No.

658
00:35:27,245 --> 00:35:29,455
I am quietly confident
that we will get a bite.

659
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:32,421
You think you're playing him, and
he thinks he's playing you.

660
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:34,152
One of you is wrong.

661
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:39,578
Thank you.

662
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,089
Thank you.

663
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,575
I kept my side of the
bargain. Now it's your turn.

664
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,780
- Tell what you know.
- Absolutely.

665
00:35:52,905 --> 00:35:54,344
All will be revealed.

666
00:35:54,803 --> 00:35:55,795
But here?

667
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,602
Give me a chance to catch
a breath of fresh air,

668
00:35:59,197 --> 00:36:01,367
And then we will sit and
talk as long as you like.

669
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,703
And i got a lot to tell.
And i owe you...

670
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:04,755
Big-time.

671
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,327
I owe you my life.

672
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,456
In the meantime,

673
00:36:08,806 --> 00:36:10,709
I would kill for
a cheeseburger and fries.

674
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,564
Drive-through.

675
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:14,463
Put this on.

676
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,007
Can't you say "please"?
I'm a free man now.

677
00:36:18,413 --> 00:36:19,715
Put this on... Please.

678
00:36:20,591 --> 00:36:21,342
Sure.

679
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:33,940
<i>MEAT IS MURDER</i>

680
00:36:34,958 --> 00:36:36,151
<i>FUR IS EVIL</i>

681
00:36:44,012 --> 00:36:45,171
What is this?

682
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,268
Oh Jesus, come on!

683
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:54,578
Relax

684
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:12,396
Damn it!

685
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:05,741
He vanished five hours ago, and
we've heard nothing from him since.

686
00:38:06,097 --> 00:38:07,850
The town was on
pretty good lockdown,

687
00:38:07,975 --> 00:38:10,528
So we're guessing he had friends
get him out of the area fast.

688
00:38:10,653 --> 00:38:12,131
Planted in advance, probably.

689
00:38:13,737 --> 00:38:15,615
Would you stop that?
It's not your fault.

690
00:38:15,831 --> 00:38:18,935
Well, whose fault is it then?
It's mine. I have to accept that.

691
00:38:19,804 --> 00:38:20,747
Actually,

692
00:38:21,064 --> 00:38:22,285
it's... it's my fault.

693
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:23,745
Okay, everyone? My fault.

694
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:25,844
What's done is done. Focus on now.

695
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:28,995
We need to get to renfrew
before red john does.

696
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,629
Where is he now? Who are his
friends? What are his options?

697
00:38:45,139 --> 00:38:46,349
- Hello?
- <i>mr. Jane.</i>

698
00:38:46,474 --> 00:38:49,885
I just wanted to call and
apologize for letting you down.

699
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:50,965
Hello, jared.

700
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:53,900
It was dishonorable, i know, but...

701
00:38:54,025 --> 00:38:56,136
Crossing red john just...

702
00:38:56,261 --> 00:38:57,459
Seems too dangerous.

703
00:38:57,937 --> 00:38:59,675
You've already crossed him.

704
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,275
You need our protection.

705
00:39:01,542 --> 00:39:03,340
I haven't given you a thing.

706
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:05,842
- How is he to know that?
- <i>Oh, he'll know.</i>

707
00:39:06,393 --> 00:39:07,438
He'll know.

708
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:10,681
Like i said, i have friends, and
they'll put in a good word for me.

709
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,449
Friends? What friends?
<i>Who?</i>

710
00:39:13,785 --> 00:39:15,477
Wouldn't you like to know?

711
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:19,039
Jared, listen to me. You can't trust
them. They're not your friends.

712
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:21,179
Vaya con dios, amigo.

713
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:24,673
Jared.

714
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:31,475
Damn fool. Red john probably
already has his location.

715
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,230
- Did you trace the line?
- Yes, i'm tracking the call now.

716
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:37,352
He's in tijuana, mexico,

717
00:39:37,477 --> 00:39:39,159
in a motel room with a hooker.

718
00:39:40,446 --> 00:39:41,225
Because?

719
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:44,655
He wouldn't call if he didn't
think he was out of our reach.

720
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,768
I could hear latin music
and sirens and horns

721
00:39:46,893 --> 00:39:48,837
and a whole neighborhood
in the background,

722
00:39:48,962 --> 00:39:51,215
Which suggests thin
walls and a city.

723
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:53,807
- Hence, tijuana motel room.
- And the hooker?

724
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:55,569
He needs to use somebody's phone,

725
00:39:55,694 --> 00:39:58,080
and he has been in prison for a year.
Hence, the hooker.

726
00:39:58,205 --> 00:40:00,167
The phone belongs to
juana porfiria braga...

727
00:40:00,292 --> 00:40:02,357
Calle rojas 65, tijuana, mexico.

728
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:04,568
Five arrests on
prostitution charges.

729
00:40:05,334 --> 00:40:06,945
Let me get a location on the call.

730
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:10,032
I'll go reach out to the
federal police in tijuana.

731
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,800
- You boys come with me.
- Yes, sir.

732
00:40:17,179 --> 00:40:18,289
Go ahead. Say it.

733
00:40:18,414 --> 00:40:20,900
- Say what?
- You told me. You warned me.

734
00:40:21,025 --> 00:40:23,160
You get the privilege of
saying,"i told you so."

735
00:40:23,285 --> 00:40:24,781
That's all right. Not now.

736
00:40:25,012 --> 00:40:26,405
This isn't over yet.

737
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:29,760
We're gonna find renfrew, And
he's gonna tell us what he knows.

738
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:30,672
Got it.

739
00:40:31,446 --> 00:40:33,190
Motel carona del norte.

740
00:41:31,852 --> 00:41:32,820
<i>He is...</i>

741
00:41:49,975 --> 00:41:51,778
Well, you can say it now.

742
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:54,755
Well, i don't really
feel like saying it.

743
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:57,715
- Let me take a rain check on that.
- Sure.

744
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:02,136
What do you think it means?

745
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:08,024
It means red john is far more
powerful than i ever thought.

746
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:11,301
He's been way ahead
of me this whole time.

747
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,115
I mean the writing on the wall.

748
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:20,954
I have no idea.

749
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:24,046
It's a good clue, though, isn't it?

750
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,085
Jared was trying to tell
us something important.

751
00:42:27,814 --> 00:42:28,628
Maybe.

752
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:32,062
Next time,

753
00:42:32,734 --> 00:42:33,800
we'll get him.

754
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:37,345
Next time.

755
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:04,435
Hello?
