1
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,860
- Hey,Tommy.  -  Hey.

2
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,960
Good morning,Mr. Jane.

3
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,100
- You're all set.  - Have a good one.

4
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,030
You,too. Have a good one.

5
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,330
Good morning,everybody.

6
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,330
What's so good about it?

7
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,800
Here,have a file.

8
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,000
- The division's being audited again.  - No problem.

9
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,360
Let me just put milk in this,and I'll dig in.

10
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,160
- "No problem." What's with her?  - You mean,why isn't she cynical and jaded like you?

11
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,130
Notice her relaxed body language,

12
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,630
The general sense of emotional satisfaction?

13
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,400
Yeah.

14
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,800
Someone's engaged her romantic interest.

15
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,130
- Who?  - Well,I couldn't say.

16
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,630
Nah,she's focused on her work,that's all.

17
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,800
Well,then I have to assume that the man that kissed her outside

18
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:53,630
- was making an embarrassing mistake.  - Hmm? What? Who kissed her?

19
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:54,100
Uh,I didn't catch his name.

20
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,760
Ah,it's probably that knucklehead from payroll.

21
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,300
He's been stalking her like a chicken.

22
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,760
- What did this man look like?  - Lisbon!

23
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,930
- How do you stalk a chicken?  - You know what I'm talking about.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,110
"There's a very large bomb nearby"

25
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:16,200
"Are you smart enough to find it?"

26
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,060
Another bomb threat.

27
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,050
- That's the third this year.  - Not on my phone,it isn't.

28
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,360
Well,granted,they don't usually come through CBI,

29
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,000
- But that's what the drills are for.  - The text read,"are you smart enough to find it?"

30
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,230
- I think this was directed at me.  - Of course you think this is about you.

31
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,560
Just relax. It could be a hoax.

32
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,930
It could be.

33
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,860
- Where is the bomb squad?  - They're on their way now.

34
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,900
P.D. did an initial sweep of the building.

35
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,400
So far,they haven't found anything.

36
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,830
"Are you smart enough to find it?"

37
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,430
Okay,listen,if this really is about Jane,

38
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,000
I don't want him just... I...

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,230
Hey! Jane!

40
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,660
Jane,stop right there!

41
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,500
Minelli.

42
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,760
- Yes,sir.  - Jane!

43
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,000
Let me explain what happened. Jane got a text on his phone.

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,310
The text said,"a very large bomb."

45
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,600
A large bomb can only be transported

46
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,230
In a large car.

47
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,860
They didn't say inside CBI. They said nearby.

48
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,090
Ergo,the parking lot. Simple.

49
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,660
Exactly. They challenged you to an easy puzzle.

50
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,330
- They want you to find the bomb.  - If there is a bomb.

51
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:24,680
It could be just a hoax,like you said.

52
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,500
Yes sir. I'll have him back in a minute.

53
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,660
I'm trying,sir. A minute.

54
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,660
I'll have him back in a minute.

55
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,710
Hey! Lisbon!

56
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:39,760
Found it!

57
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,260
Oh,no.

58
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,860
Shoot it out! Shout it out with your gun!

59
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,530
I... I can't! There's no time! Come on!

60
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,760
Jane,come on,let's go!

61
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,960
Come on,run,Jane! Jane,run!

62
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,230
I mean it,come on!

63
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:15,430
Jane! Run,run!

64
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,090
I'm okay. You all right?

65
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,130
- I'm okay,I'm okay.  - All right.

66
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:46,950
I'm fine. I'm gonna get you... I need an ambulance now!

67
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,730
No,no ambulance. I just got something in my eyes.

68
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:53,430
Aah!

69
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,630
I can't see.

70
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,760
I can't see!

71
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,860
You're a lucky man,Mr. Jane.

72
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,330
- This could have been much worse.  - Yes,that's what people keep telling me.

73
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,730
But why is it I can't see,doctor?

74
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,850
Well,there's a moderate concussion

75
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:21,230
with some short-term memory loss,

76
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,560
disorientation,headache,

77
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,960
and of course,fleeting blindness.

78
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,760
It's most likely due to small floating blood clots

79
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,830
in the vessels around the eyes,demonstrating a C.V.I.

80
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,360
or cortical visual impairment.

81
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,860
How long will his vision be affected?

82
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,730
Well,it's hard to say,really.

83
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:38,660
The body's healing powers are unpredictable,

84
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,030
but 48 to 72 hours is the normal.

85
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:43,360
We must wait and see,so to speak.

86
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,830
Huh. Humor. Great.

87
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:47,430
Everybody loves a witty doctor in times of trouble.

88
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,960
You know,I've heard enough. Do you think you can take

89
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,100
- this conversation outside,please?  - Mr. Jane,this is temporary.

90
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,990
Your sight will return and you'll be back to work,

91
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:59,930
- but it's gonna take time and patience.  - Well,time I have,but patience I lost a while ago.

92
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:03,000
- You're alive. Appreciate it.  - Oh,I do. Believe me,I do.

93
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,530
Now if you'll excuse me,I'll check in again later.

94
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,030
Thank you,doctor.

95
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:11,730
Ow! I'll do worse if you don't stop mouthing off

96
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:14,460
- to people who are trying to help you.  - You pinched me.

97
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,230
- How is he?  - Guess what. He's a bad patient.

98
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:20,260
- Who would've thought?  - I'm not a bad patient. She's a bad visitor.

99
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:25,230
- What'd you find out?  - The victim is james medina,44,stockbroker,out of highlands.

100
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,230
The van wasn't his. It was reported stolen yesterday.

101
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,930
We're digging up everything we can on Medina.

102
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,630
The question is it possible

103
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:36,600
- he was on some bizarre suicide mission?  - No. I looked in his eyes.

104
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,430
That was very much a man who didn't want to be where he was.

105
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,360
Whoever did this wanted me

106
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,560
to watch james medina die in terror.

107
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,880
- They nearly killed you,too.  - Well,that wasn't the intention,though.

108
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,160
- Well,what then?  - "you're next" was written on the man's forehead.

109
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,430
Why?

110
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:56,630
I don't know why.

111
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,680
- You're gonna be fine.  - Yeah,probably.

112
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,530
- We're gonna find who did this.  - Good.

113
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,260
Oh,please don't look at each other like that.

114
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,230
Like what? You can't see.

115
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,660
I can feel. I can feel your pity.

116
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,000
Oh,please. Would you stop?

117
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,630
We'll be back.

118
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:18,200
Later,man.

119
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:31,930
Thank you,Rose.

120
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,030
All righty,you two.

121
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,890
I love you.

122
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:41,660
You be good with your auntie Rose now,okay?

123
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,330
You promise?

124
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,630
Bye.

125
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,260
Sweet kids.

126
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:56,060
Thank you. Jim loved them very much.

127
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,530
I'm sorry,Mrs. Medina,

128
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:01,200
but we have to ask you a couple questions about your husband.

129
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,160
He didn't seem preoccupied,trouble by anything unusual?

130
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,100
Preoccupied,yes,but there's nothing unusual about that.

131
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,200
My husband was a stockbroker,

132
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,960
and nowadays,that's like being a professional gambler.

133
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,360
- What about your personal finances?  - I never let jim put all our money into the stock market.

134
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,360
Did he ever mention any particular client being unhappy?

135
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,330
Do you know how much clients

136
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,430
have lost their money in the last six months?

137
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:26,100
A lot of people are angry,and they blame their brokers.

138
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,960
Jim's received hate mail,phone calls,e-mails.

139
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,800
Any specific threats? Did he ever mention names?

140
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,760
There was an ex-coworker,Terry Andrews.

141
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:39,300
He came by the house a few times. He was very threatening.

142
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:42,600
Thank you.

143
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:48,130
Terence Carter Andrews,46 years old,

144
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:50,500
worked for two years at Lynch-halstead

145
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,460
in the junior trader program.

146
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,560
Tax records indicate that he also worked as a guard

147
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,000
for several security companies

148
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,060
That cover the state capitol system.

149
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,060
- He was a state house employee?  - He worked here?

150
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,630
That's what it says. He also has a rap sheet on him

151
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:05,160
- Domestic violence and two d.u.i.s.  - This is him?

152
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,660
Where is he working now?

153
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:12,630
Guest relations manager at something called hype.

154
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,830
You,little miss fierce,can come in.

155
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,160
Lose the backup dancer. He's too,too butch.

156
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,560
Get lost,fluffy.

157
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,480
Are you Terence Andrews?

158
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,330
What do you guys want?

159
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,630
Do people call you Terry or Terence?

160
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:39,600
They call me Mr.Andrews.

161
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,860
Someone killed James Medina today. Thoughts?

162
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,230
Yeah.

163
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:47,460
I'd like to buy whoever did it a nice bottle of French brandy.

164
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,260
- Flat-out hated him,huh?  - Yeah. Yeah,I did.

165
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,160
What,do you think I had something to do with it?

166
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,160
- Yeah,it crossed our minds.  - Why don't you come downtown with us,answer a few questions?

167
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,460
No,I don't think so. You know why? Because I didn't do it.

168
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,860
- Come on,man. Let's go.  - Get off me!

169
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,230
- Now you want some,too?  - No,thank you.

170
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,960
Oh!

171
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,400
Okay,everybody step back. Give him some air. Fun's over.

172
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,260
Are you okay,Mr. Andrews?

173
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,860
Hey,aren't you supposed to be in the hospital?

174
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,130
- Nope.  - Yes,you are.

175
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:32,000
No,they've had enough of me. Can't say I blame 'em.

176
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,260
Officer Powell here was kind enough to give me a ride back.

177
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,960
Thank you. I guess.

178
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,900
- Have a good one,Mr.Jane.  - Yeah.

179
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:44,630
- Go ahead. Talk to your boyfriend. I don't mind.  - Shush.

180
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,580
- Why are you embarrassed?  - I'm not. I'm...

181
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,460
- What the hell...  - Oh,doctor's orders.

182
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,960
She said it was the best thing for me to do-get back to work.

183
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,380
She did not. She said you insulted the entire ward

184
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,760
- And were a complete pain in the ass.  - Nah. So?

185
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,500
So you can't do that.

186
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,300
Well,what was I supposed to do,

187
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,300
Just sit there and listen to television?

188
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,030
- Besides,the food was terrible.  - You need the rest.

189
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,530
- I need to work.  - You're blind.

190
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:08,730
No problem,honestly. My other senses are heightened.

191
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:11,330
They're super heightened. I'm like daredevil.

192
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,230
Now if you'll excuse me...

193
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:17,130
- Okay.  - Okay.

194
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,790
Ah. Heightened.

195
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,510
Where were you yesterday morning?

196
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,860
My shift at the club ended at 3:30.

197
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,000
I went back to my place,watched a little bit of TV,

198
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,900
Then I went to bed.

199
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,900
I slept till about 11:00 or so.

200
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,760
- Anyone who can vouch for that time frame?  - No. I live alone,

201
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,360
On account of my lady walked out on me when I lost my job.

202
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,900
Sorry. Don't mind me.

203
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,030
Jane?

204
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,950
What is this?

205
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:48,790
He's blind.

206
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,560
Yeah.

207
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,560
Uh,sorry.

208
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,460
Cool,huh?

209
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:00,560
Ahem. Yeah,so,uh,did you kill James Medina?

210
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,630
Did I kill James Medina?

211
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,730
Screw him.

212
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:07,300
I didn't kill him. I could have

213
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,790
And I wanted to,but I didn't.

214
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,730
What are you doing?

215
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:16,160
Have we ever met before?

216
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,560
No.

217
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,790
So what happened?

218
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,930
Why did you and medina fighghin the first place?

219
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:24,030
I was a junior trader in the company's program.

220
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,030
And he had been picking on me for months.

221
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:28,460
I took a job his nephew wanted.

222
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:31,110
Anyway,a freakin' envelope falls off his desk.

223
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:33,730
"pick it up," he said. Like that,"pick it up."

224
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:36,000
I don't think so.

225
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,760
"pick it up your own damn self," I said.

226
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,960
Big deal.

227
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,860
But I guess he figures I'm just,you know,

228
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,830
I'm gonna snap my fingers

229
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:45,060
And totally just ruin this dude's life.

230
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,760
Can I hold your hand?

231
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,500
Artistic fingers.

232
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,160
Soft.

233
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,360
Don't do that.

234
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,230
Nice to talk with you,Terry. Be well. You can let him go.

235
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,300
Uh,that's,uh,not your call.

236
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,300
<i>well,I didn't say you must let him go.</i>

237
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,100
I said that you can,if you want.

238
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,830
- Being that he's innocent.  - Thank you.

239
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:23,160
- Jane?  - Whoa. Oh,that was loud. That scared me.

240
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,100
How many times do I have to tell you

241
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,700
To stop interrupting interviews like that?

242
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,650
Oh,I'm sorry. Oh.

243
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,530
Just a minute.

244
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:33,000
What are you doing?

245
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
How will I know if I can see or not if I have bandages on?

246
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,790
Ow.

247
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:45,430
Here goes.

248
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:48,900
Well?

249
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,600
Black as night.

250
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,550
I'm sorry.

251
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,430
Never mind.

252
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:58,100
Andrews didn't do it.

253
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,730
- Did you sense that with your superpowers?  - Yes,I did.

254
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,200
Uh,he's filled with anger,

255
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,860
But,uh,not fearful,guilty,murderous anger.

256
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,650
That has a tang of ammonia about it.

257
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:12,400
His is a more clean,righteous anger.

258
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,560
- Lemon-y.  - Lemon-y?

259
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,600
This blind thing really works.

260
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,030
Without my vision,

261
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,180
I can tune into my other senses much more clearly.

262
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,300
That's great. Let me go make you a superhero costume.

263
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,330
What do you wanna be called?

264
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:28,200
- What are you doing?  - I wanna know what your face feels like when you're smiling.

265
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,400
Uh,so what's the deal,boss?

266
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,760
Have forensics check him for any explosives residue.

267
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,400
- If he comes up clean,let him go.  - Will do.

268
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,680
I'm still convinced there's a connection

269
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,490
Between Medina and me,so before you make me

270
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,590
That superhero costume I'm looking forward to,

271
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:49,660
- Could you take me to visit with his widow?  - Maybe.

272
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,400
Thank you. And incidentally,

273
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,260
You're smelling particularly good today.

274
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,260
Is that cinnamon in the mix there somewhere? Lisbon?

275
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,260
Your tea is right in front of you,Mr.Jane

276
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,800
Ah,thank you.

277
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,260
You're welcome.

278
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:08,330
Mrs. Medina,we don't mean to keep you from your family.

279
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:12,000
We just have a few more questions to ask you.

280
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,400
I understand. I'm... Happy to help.

281
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,460
I can feel what a warm,caring home this is.

282
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:22,060
I'm very sorry for your loss.

283
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,730
I think whoever did this was targeting

284
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:27,860
Your husband and me also. I don't know why,

285
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,930
But something links us.

286
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,430
I have to ask,have we ever met before?

287
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,360
Not that I know of.

288
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,100
Would it be a terrible inconvenience to show me

289
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,760
Some of your husband's personal things?

290
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,860
Jewelry,anything he used a lot?

291
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,530
Sure. I guess. Why?

292
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:48,600
Holding something of James' would help me

293
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,630
Pick up a feel for him,get a sense of his being.

294
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:54,160
Okay. Excuse me.

295
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,690
Thank you.

296
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:02,760
- A sense of his being? What are you playing at?  - Just go with it.

297
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,330
I have to practice this touchy-feely stuff.

298
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:07,760
- It's been a while.  - You're not gonna be blind forever.

299
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,160
No,right,'cause bad stuff like this doesn't happen.

300
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,130
Nearly as often as people think it does.

301
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,500
Bifocals.

302
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,560
Mm-hmm. Jim couldn't read without them.

303
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,600
He was considering surgery,

304
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,360
But I liked the way he looked in his glasses.

305
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,060
He held off because of me.

306
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,200
Did he like horses?

307
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,060
We liked to ride together.

308
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:43,500
We were planning to take a trip up the coast this fall.

309
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,400
This feels expensive.

310
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,230
Uh,yes.

311
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,960
He only wore that to business functions.

312
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,560
There's a jewel with an engraving on the back.

313
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,260
What is that engraving?

314
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,660
It's a bull.

315
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,630
It was a company gift from Lynch-Halstead.

316
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:05,360
A little too much bling for Jim's everyday taste.

317
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:24,860
Jane?

318
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:31,690
Well,uh,thank you for your time,Mrs. Medina.

319
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:36,860
The watch I recalled was the exact same.

320
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,430
It had the same engraving on the back as James Medina's

321
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:43,860
- and his was from Lynch-Halstead.  - Thank you.

322
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:44,860
Uh...

323
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,760
So,years ago,

324
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,800
I must've done a psychic reading for someone else

325
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,000
- connected to the firm.  - You don't know who?

326
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,460
I can't remember.

327
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,500
I tried to see the woman's face,recall her name.

328
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,300
I... I just can't do it.

329
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,730
But she paid you

330
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:01,460
- and was hurt so badly she's still holding a grudge.  - Well,probably.

331
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,430
- The man's blind. Go easy,maybe.  -  Sorry.

332
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,400
Oh,it's okay. You're fine.

333
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,600
Did you keep a record of all your customers

334
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,450
- or clients or whatever you called them?  - Yeah,I had to.

335
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:15,260
I had to keep track of all the lies I'd already told them.

336
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,730
Oh,where are they?

337
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:20,530
Uh,probably on a disk in my boxes over there,I expect.

338
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:23,680
Van Pelt,why don't you help Jane find his records?

339
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:27,760
Oh,first,could someone please make me a cup of tea?

340
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,160
Is that a yes?

341
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:37,500
Rigsby.

342
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:50,690
Thank you.

343
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:06,130
- Did you put the milk in...  - Milk in first. Yep.

344
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:08,160
Just like you asked.

345
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,460
You sure the water boiled...

346
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,690
Was truly boiling? Yep.

347
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:22,600
- Tastes weird.  - Tastes weird?

348
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,830
Jane,I need to ask you a favor.

349
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,260
I need you to,uh...

350
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,260
I need to you find out from Van Pelt

351
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:35,200
- about this guy she's dating. You know,what's the score?  - The score?

352
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,700
- Is it serious? Are they,uh,you know?  - Ask her yourself.

353
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,160
Yeah,right. No. Come on. You know the situation.

354
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,700
It's against the rules- relationships between coworkers.

355
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,960
- What are you,a man or a mouse?  -  Well,man,obviously.

356
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,130
- Could've fooled me.  - If it's that guy from payroll,I will kill him.

357
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,260
Well,that would be a strong,romantic statement.

358
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,400
Women like a man that would kill for them.

359
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,700
- Hey,Van Pelt!  - Don't!

360
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,900
- What?  - No. No.

361
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,360
- Trust me. Honesty's better.  - No.

362
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,030
What's up?

363
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,330
Grace,personal question.

364
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:05,790
Rigsby and I were wondering,uh...

365
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:08,400
who is this man you were kissing by the coffee cart?

366
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,760
That's... That's none of your business.

367
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,860
- Not from payroll?  - Payroll?

368
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:16,600
- No,he doesn't even work here. It's none of your business.  - Well,thank heavens for that,at least.

369
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,760
- No killing needed. Huh.  - Don't be so sure.

370
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,460
You'll see. Honesty's best.

371
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:24,700
Yeah,well,honestly,I'd like to kick your butt right now.

372
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,700
I'll take you.

373
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,260
But could you take me to my couch first,please?

374
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,730
- Yes.  - Thank you.

375
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:35,950
- You're in your office. Here's the table on the left.  - Yep.

376
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:39,130
- Here's the couch. - All right. You're very good at this.

377
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:43,360
Thank you. Thanks for your lovely tea.

378
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,300
That was cruel. Why did you do that?

379
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,700
Oh,it's this blindness nuisance. It makes me mean.

380
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,200
I'm... I'm sorry.

381
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,680
But you two do need to talk.

382
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,130
There's nothing to talk about.

383
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,750
Is this it?

384
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,300
Uh... Sorry.

385
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,630
Uh,a white cd with "r.p.b." written on it in black?

386
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:12,300
Could be. You have a lot to talk about.

387
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,030
Like what?

388
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:16,560
Is it serious- you and coffee cart man?

389
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,530
It's too early to tell.

390
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:21,860
I'd like to meet him. What floor does he work on?

391
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,030
He doesn't. He's a lawyer.

392
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:26,130
- Ah.  - He was just visiting.

393
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:28,160
And no offense,but why does my personal life

394
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,660
have any concern to you... or Rigsby,for that matter?

395
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,200
Well,me... I'm just nosy.

396
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,660
But Rigsby... He loves you.

397
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,760
He's just scared of emotional commitment.

398
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,300
And you're attracted to him,but you're deeply repressed

399
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,860
- and emotionally shut down.  - Oh,is that right?

400
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,330
Because of a trauma in your past

401
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:50,660
that you've never spoken of to anyone,

402
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,330
Ever-even yourself.

403
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:00,530
Sorry. I was just thinking out loud.

404
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:04,300
What? I wasn't listening.

405
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,700
What's his name?

406
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,460
- Dan.  - Dan?

407
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,360
- Can I meet him?  - If you like.

408
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,160
- I would.  - Here's your client list.

409
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,760
I'll run it against the Lynch-Halstead records.

410
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,560
One match.

411
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,000
You both shared a client a long time ago... Carol Gentry?

412
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,960
Carol Gentry

413
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:39,630
She forgives you,Carol.

414
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:44,210
Your mother truly forgives you.

415
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:48,760
I don't understand,Mr. Jane.

416
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,230
She forgives me?

417
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:55,930
Yes. That's what she says.

418
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:59,130
And I believe it to be sincere.

419
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:05,060
She was a vicious,evil,abusive woman,

420
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:09,100
But I loved her and cared for her like a good daughter.

421
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:13,430
What did I ever do that she should forgive me for?

422
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,660
It's a hard truth,Carol,

423
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:28,100
that people don't change when they pass on.

424
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:31,500
They simply become the essence of who they are.

425
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,030
Your mother was a very complicated woman...

426
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:36,160
She forgives me?

427
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,280
That lunatic bitch forgives me?

428
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,360
People are very complicated.

429
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,600
Aren't they?

430
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:55,160
I'm afraid that's all we have time for this week,Carol.

431
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,860
Oh.

432
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,760
Okay. Yeah.

433
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,160
I'm sorry. I just...

434
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:06,330
It's okay. Just breathe.

435
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:13,000
We'll talk more about this next time,shall we?

436
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,830
- Yeah.  - Okay.

437
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:17,260
Okay.

438
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:24,530
- Thank you,Mr. Jane.  - Thank you.

439
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:05,700
Jane? Are you all right?

440
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,430
Jane?

441
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:10,160
Are you all right?

442
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,760
Yeah,yeah. Uh,I'm fine.

443
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:16,760
I'm fine.

444
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:27,300
Jane! Jane?

445
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,530
Is he all right?

446
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:30,830
Oh,I'm 100% okay. No need to send me back.

447
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,880
Sir,he needs to be in the hospital.

448
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,860
He has to go if you order him to.

449
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:38,010
I could,but someone did try to kill him,remember?

450
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:41,130
We can protect him better here... At less expense.

451
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:42,530
Thanks,Virgil.

452
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:46,000
Okay,but this is a favor. If you die in this department,

453
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,860
I'm responsible. I do all the paperwork.

454
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:51,660
In fact,if he does die for whatever reason,

455
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:54,830
Move him to a public area,would you? I'd be very grateful.

456
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:56,560
I hope he's smiling.

457
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,300
Places to be!

458
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,450
Don't we all.

459
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:02,530
Uh... Uh...

460
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:05,160
A little help here?

461
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,900
Just the stick. Just the stick.

462
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:14,660
Thank you.

463
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,500
We started doing research on your old client,Carol Gentry.

464
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,730
- She's not a suspect.  - Lynch-Halstead were her brokerage firm for a while.

465
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:25,730
Just a coincidence. She's not a suspect.

466
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:29,200
- How can you be so sure?  - Carol Gentry killed herself eight years ago.

467
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,790
She left no family.

468
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,680
You all still here?

469
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,300
We're all here.

470
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,160
Good.

471
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,200
So back to square one,I guess?

472
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,060
Not quite. Van Pelt's done some deeper research.

473
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,100
We cross-checked the spouse's names.

474
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,160
And came up with a second hit.

475
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,230
You used to have a client named Jill Lamont.

476
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:52,960
Her husband was Paul Krager.

477
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,830
- And he used to work for Lynch-Halstead.  - Jill Lamont?

478
00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:00,530
Yes.

479
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:06,530
Tell me more about your husband just anything.

480
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:10,230
He loves me,loves our son.

481
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:13,580
Family is everything to him.

482
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:16,900
But I've noticed a change...

483
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:20,000
Lately.

484
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,760
What sort of a change?

485
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,530
He seems,uh...

486
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:29,230
preoccupied.

487
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,260
And that's when you began to wonder

488
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,650
if he was being unfaithful?

489
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:36,960
- That's right.  - All right.

490
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,960
Something's coming through.

491
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:50,500
Feel it with me.

492
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:54,930
Here.

493
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,630
Yes,I'm feeling that Paul hasn't been

494
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:03,200
100% honest with you.

495
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:07,410
He hasn't been happy.

496
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:11,530
You know that,don't you?

497
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,030
Yes.

498
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:18,660
Do you sense someone else in his life?

499
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:22,630
- Your senses never lie.  - Yes.

500
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:25,050
- Yes,I do.  - Okay.

501
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:27,290
There's someone else.

502
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,460
Is he leaving me?

503
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:32,230
You have to talk to him,Jill.

504
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:37,500
You have to tell Paul not to ruin what you have together.

505
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:41,300
Paul Krager's a name I haven't heard in a while.

506
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:45,400
- It never even entered my mind.  - What do you know about his personal life?

507
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,060
We've all made our mistakes over the years.

508
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,660
Fat wallets and good wine can do that to a man.

509
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:54,030
- You're referring to his divorce?  - That was no divorce. That was a massacre.

510
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:56,000
His wife remarried,I think.

511
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,130
But Krager's whole world fell apart.

512
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:00,460
Work-wise,he never recovered. Went off the rails,to be frank.

513
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,460
We had to let him go.

514
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,230
- Who actually did the firing?  - Now that you mention it,Jimmy Medina did.

515
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:07,200
Jim did a lot of the ax work here.

516
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,960
Unfortunate part of the job. Any idea where we can find Krager now?

517
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,260
Last I heard,someone saw him at a church soup kitchen

518
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,100
during the holidays.

519
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:21,430
Their brife for the grace of God,if you know what I mean.

520
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,460
Well,Lynch was right.

521
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,680
The legal fees alone nearly bankrupted Krager.

522
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,960
His wife took their son,moved east and remarried.

523
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,200
- So where's Krager now?  - Well,based on we could find,

524
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,160
he was so devastated losing his family,

525
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,560
- His whole world collapsed.  - No permanent address.

526
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,060
He hasn't filed a tax return in years.

527
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:41,060
His last known employer was lynch-halstead in 2001.

528
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,060
Boy,you really did a number on him.

529
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,660
Yes,I did. Thank you.

530
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:48,660
No,you simply confirmed what she knew in her heart already.

531
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:51,530
Has anyone tried contacting her,Jill Lamont?

532
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:53,360
Yeah,I left word. No answer yet.

533
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,130
I put an A.P.B. Out on Paul Krager.

534
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:57,300
Cho and I are gonna follow up on some leads.

535
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,830
You stay right there.

536
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:02,860
Nobody take him anywhere. No excitement what so ever. Clear?

537
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,460
- Clear,boss.  - Clear,boss.

538
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,400
Crystal.

539
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,680
Did you see how many clients Jane had?

540
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,930
Well,I guess he helped a lot of people.

541
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:13,400
I'm not so sure.

542
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:18,360
Hi. Can I help you?

543
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,130
- Dan. Hey.  - Hi.

544
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:23,660
Hi. What are you doing here?

545
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:26,080
I was at another meeting upstairs.

546
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,460
Thought I'd stop by and say hello.

547
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,430
- Is that cool?  - Yeah,totally.

548
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:34,010
You know,it's just a surprise,that's all.

549
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:37,530
So,um... Introduce me to your colleague,

550
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:41,100
- Who keeps staring at me so strangely.  - Yeah.

551
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:44,100
Uh... Agent Rigsby?

552
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,900
This is my friend,Dan Hollenbeck.

553
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,660
- Good to meet you.  - Hi. How you doing?

554
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,300
Uh,I'm excellent. And you?

555
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,860
Good. Yeah.

556
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,200
- Okay,so...  - A lawyer,are you?

557
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,600
I am.

558
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,900
I'm sorry. Do we have a problem?

559
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,700
No. No problem. It takes all sorts,even lawyers.

560
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,960
Okay,that's enough.

561
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,860
Pleasure to get to know you,Agent Rigsby.

562
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,760
Can we...

563
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,050
Can we be somewhere private for a moment?

564
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:15,300
Uh... I don't know if that's such a...

565
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,130
- Good idea.  - Please?

566
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:19,700
You know what? I'm sorry. You and me do have a problem.

567
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,010
Not a big one,but we do need to talk.

568
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:24,260
- No trouble,I swear.  - All right,then.

569
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:26,430
- No,it is not all right.  - No trouble. I promise.

570
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:28,400
It's okay,Grace. It's fine.

571
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,500
Okay.

572
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,730
So here we are.

573
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,690
Talk away.

574
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,690
I don't know you,Dan.

575
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:44,500
Maybe you're a nice guy. I hope so.

576
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,800
I don't know. Because if you ever hurt Grace Van Pelt,

577
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,410
I will find you and I will cause you pain,

578
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:52,960
Because she means a lot to... to the unit.

579
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,860
- So you treat her right,okay?  - Yeah,I hear you.

580
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,830
I appreciate your concern.

581
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:00,760
You care for Grace. Don't worry. I'm a...

582
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:04,460
I'm a nice guy.

583
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:08,300
Okay. Hey,uh,I'm sorry to get heavy with you.

584
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,830
All right. I had to say it,you know?

585
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:13,400
- Just so long as we understand each other.  - Yeah,sure thing.

586
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:17,200
I understand. I do.

587
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,030
I am so embarrassed. What did Rigsby say to you?

588
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,460
No call for embarrassment.

589
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,330
He's a good-hearted person. I like him.

590
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:13,160
He just wants you to be happy... Or else.

591
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,030
And what did you say?

592
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:17,160
Hmm. Well,I'd say I did my best.

593
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,130
- You did?  - I did.

594
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,330
Hey,where is this psychic character

595
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:23,660
You told me about? I'm dying to meet him.

596
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:26,900
He wanted to meet you,too.

597
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,730
Jane?

598
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,660
Damn.

599
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:52,500
Sorry. I didn't know whether to wake you or not.

600
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,030
I'm awake.

601
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:56,860
You said you wanted to meet the man I've been dating.

602
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,830
- Yeah. Is he coming?  - He's here.

603
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:01,200
Here? Here now?

604
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,360
Yes.

605
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,500
Right here.

606
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,200
- Oh.  - Dan hollenbeck,sir.

607
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,730
It's a real pleasure to meet you.

608
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:10,230
Grace has told me so much about you.

609
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:12,230
Good to meet you,too,Dan.

610
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:15,930
- Excuse my asking,but are you... Blind?  - Yes,as a bat.

611
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:18,200
Temporarily blind. Think positive.

612
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,660
Yes,positive. That's right.

613
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:23,100
So,Van Pelt,where is Rigsby exactly?

614
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,560
I don't know.

615
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,600
Out getting pizza,if I know Rigsby.

616
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,900
You need him for something?

617
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,200
Lisbon? Cho?

618
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,300
Still chasing down Paul Krager.

619
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,330
- Nobody here but us.  - Of course.

620
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:37,760
So,Dan,quite the hard grip you have there.

621
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,660
Working man's hands.

622
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,810
That,uh,faint scent of chemicals

623
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:43,930
but an expensive Italian suit.

624
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:45,750
It's interesting.

625
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,500
Dan's a lawyer.

626
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,530
A very junior lawyer. I lobby the state senate.

627
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:52,500
But you're good with your hands.

628
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,500
- You're good at building things as a hobby,maybe.  - I guess.

629
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,230
What sort of things do you build as a hobby?

630
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:00,230
You know,stuff.

631
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:03,430
And your parents? Where are they?

632
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:07,130
They're dead.

633
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:09,900
Sorry to be a busybody.

634
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,960
- I just wanna be sure Grace finds the right young man.  - Mm.

635
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,630
Hush.

636
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:15,460
Well,I'm hungry.

637
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:18,460
I... I guess I'll just,uh,get myself something to eat.

638
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:21,760
- Don't be silly. I'll get you something.  - No,no,no,no,it's okay. I can manage.

639
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,230
Think I'm dumb? Make the wrong move,

640
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:27,030
- and I'll shoot her in the head.  - I hear you.

641
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:29,860
What are you guys whispering about?

642
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:32,660
Nothing. Some chips would be nice.

643
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,980
What kind?

644
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:36,230
I'm easy.

645
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,830
It's the boss.

646
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:44,530
Looks like we've cracked it.

647
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:46,760
We found Paul Krager.

648
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,800
He was obsessed with Jane and Medina.

649
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,760
Remember he has a son?

650
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,800
Well,Krager told us he's living in the city now.

651
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,160
He goes by the name Dan Hollenbeck.

652
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,000
Van Pelt?

653
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:03,030
Sorry about this.

654
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,630
Van Pelt?

655
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:09,430
That was weird.

656
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,950
I don't understand.

657
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:13,830
He's the bomber.

658
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:17,160
He killed James Medina,and now he's come to kill me.

659
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,460
Don't even think about it.

660
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:29,860
I'm sorry I had to lie to you,Grace,truly.

661
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:32,030
- But I needed you.  - Why?

662
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:36,230
To access the statehouse lot. He used your security pass.

663
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:39,960
You son of a bitch.

664
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,460
- Just be cool,Van Pelt. Please.  - Grace,relax.

665
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:46,130
I have no desire to hurt you.

666
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:48,600
Give it up,Dan,please?

667
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,930
I'm in too deep. I can't stop now.

668
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:53,530
Don't make me hurt you.

669
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:57,060
Just do as he says.

670
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,700
Oh,you're a nice guy now,aren't you?

671
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,580
You destroyed my life for what?

672
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:08,630
Because my dad cheated on my mom?

673
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:10,460
Big deal. He wasn't perfect.

674
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,500
And for that,he's on the street.

675
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,960
He loses everything!

676
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,930
One day,I'm at the best...

677
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:18,450
The best private school in Los Angeles.

678
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:20,770
I'm playing soccer with movie stars' kids.

679
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:23,220
Next minute,I'm in Dogpatch,New Jersey,

680
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,600
with my weeping mom,getting my ass whipped

681
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,700
by thugs that don't even speak freaking english.

682
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:33,160
Why?! Because you... you had to be the man who knows.

683
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:36,000
You had to tell my mom the truth.

684
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,460
I'm sorry,Dan.

685
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,860
Yeah,sure you are,with a gun at your back.

686
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:42,860
Take out your handcuffs.

687
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,030
Handcuff yourself.

688
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,700
Behind the back. Drop the cane.

689
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,160
Oh.

690
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,800
Okay. Here we go.

691
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,460
Let's go.

692
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:01,930
- Where are we going?  - Somewhere quiet and private.

693
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:03,430
You won't like it.

694
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:04,530
Oh.

695
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,530
Where's your car,Grace?

696
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:10,230
In the side parking lot. A jeep,Iowa plates.

697
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:12,300
I didn't know you were from Iowa.

698

Gullible women.

But I can't drive.
