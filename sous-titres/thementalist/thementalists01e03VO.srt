<i>MENTALIST
/'men-t3-list/ noun</i>

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:09,470
<i>Someone who uses mental
acuity,hypnosis and/or suggestion.</i>

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,980
<i>A master manipulator of
thoughts and behavior.</i>

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,230
Victim is christine tanner, 15, drowned,
washed up on the beach in santa marta.

5
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,770
- Who's got the ultraviolet?
- Yep.

6
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,240
So she drowned. Why us?

7
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:54,440
Coroner found a wound consistent with getting hit
in the head with a surfboard and water in her lungs,

8
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,160
Only it was
ditchwater--

9
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:57,180
No salt, a lot of bugs.

10
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,550
So the killer is clever, but
not as clever as he thinks he is.

11
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,660
Santa marta sheriff's
not taking this one?

12
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,280
State beach, state case.

13
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,240
All right, what are you doing?

14
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:12,490
Grace is mentally telling me
where she hid the van keys.

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,460
If i find them, i get to drive.

16
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,170
So now you're psychic?

17
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,760
Oh, no, no, no. This is all science.

18
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,410
Concentrate, grace.

19
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,890
Tell me with your mind only.

20
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:29,370
Forward, backward, left, right.

21
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,160
How is that science?

22
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,380
He watched you hide the keys.

23
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,420
From the men's room?
That would be a trick.

24
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,690
Who's got shotgun?

25
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,280
Can we go now?

26
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:26,220
<i>Santa Maria,CA</i>

27
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:29,930
Leah, go ahead.

28
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,800
You had the keys in
your hand the whole time.

29
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,170
U've gotta let it go, man.

30
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,450
Did you have the keys in your hand?

31
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:03,990
If i tell you how it's done, pp the magic circle
will send a team of assassins to kill us all.

32
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,260
It's the law.

33
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,510
Her body was discovered
rr on this beach.

34
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,450
Coast guard says that means she was put in
the water anywhere within a mile north of here.

35
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,300
Any further along the coast, the current
would have taken her out to mexico.

36
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,420
How long was she in the water?

37
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,090
We're still waiting on
the coroner's report.

38
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,220
Hey, excuse me.

39
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,590
Are you guys cops?

40
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,030
C.b.i.

41
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,120
What's c.b.i.?

42
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,170
California bureau of investigation.

43
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,850
Cops.

44
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,680
Cops.

45
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:43,700
So is it true what they're
saying--somebody killed chris?

46
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:46,200
Yes, it is true.

47
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,250
You were christine's friend?

48
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,920
Yeah. We hang at the same breaks.

49
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,960
I love chris.

50
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,170
What happened?

51
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,180
We don't know yet. What's your name?

52
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:02,400
I'm hope. That's win.

53
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,250
When was the last
time you saw christine?

54
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,510
Uh, three days ago.

55
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,360
Sunset patrol. Epic northeast swell.

56
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,150
Chris loved to go out at sunset.

57
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,920
She would stay out till
it was dark as dark.

58
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:21,120
How did she seem lately-- just,
you know, any enemies or...

59
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,240
Stuff like that?

60
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,320
Uh, not--not
around here.

61
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,690
Everybody loved chris.

62
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,170
Was she dating anybody?

63
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,060
Dating?

64
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,140
Okay, was she hooking up
with anybody in particular?

65
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,010
Danny kurtik, mostly.

66
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,020
Jeez, hope.

67
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,680
What? They were hookin' up.

68
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,650
Danny would never hurt chris.

69
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,780
Duh, of course not.

70
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,230
That's not what they were asking.

71
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,410
They were asking who she was hooking
up with, which would be danny.

72
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,620
It wasn't a big, dark secret.

73
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,840
I need you to write down your names
and the numbers we can reach you at.

74
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,960
- Win?
- Yeah?

75
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,080
If chris was a color,
what color would she be?

76
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,950
Uh, orange... Or pink.

77
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,660
No, o-orange is right.

78
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,980
If she were an animal, what
kind of animal would she be?

79
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,560
Uh, i don't know. A rabbit?

80
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,780
How is this relevant?

81
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,120
Everything's relevant.

82
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,800
Chris was good people.

83
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,880
I hope you find who did this.

84
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,210
We'll do our best.

85
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,290
How is that relevant?

86
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,140
We're looking for someone who
doesn't like orange rabbits.

87
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,010
Exactly.

88
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,150
You know what, boys? I like it here.

89
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:39,820
Yeah. I think i'll stay for a while.

90
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,320
What?

91
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,250
Okay.

92
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,390
Let's just leave him here.

Excuse the mess.

97
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,740
Chrissy was the
house-proud one around here.

98
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,500
We understand. Mr. Tanner?

99
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,720
We may have to ask you
some tough questions, so...

100
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,980
That's okay.

101
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:28,050
Can't tell lisa nothing she hasn't
heard before, and micah don't...

102
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,350
He don't give a damn. He's slow.

103
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,050
He's just... Sad 'cause he sees lisa is.

104
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,400
All the same...

105
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,990
- Come on, kids.
- Come on, micah. Let's go.

106
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,190
- Can you take him outside?
- You got it, dad.

107
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,410
Come on. Let's go outside.

108
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,710
So when did you notice
christine was missing?

109
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:53,590
Yesterday morning.

110
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,210
She hadn't made nothing for the kids, and
i realized i hadn't seen her in a while.

111
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,350
I mean, she may be away one night
and i wouldn't know, but you know...

112
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,680
When was the last time you saw her?

113
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,110
Monday morning.

114
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,260
Any idea where she was
during that time period?

115
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,170
No. No. Chrissy's real
independent. You never...

116
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,570
Never had to worry about chrissy.

117
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:17,360
So two days to notice your daughter's
gone and another to report it.

118
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:21,280
I work. I mean, i work
construction. I never miss a day.

119
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,020
I-i can't watch her all the time.

120
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,680
Her mother's not around?

121
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:30,110
She died. She was killed in a car wreck.

122
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,330
I'm sorry.

123
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:35,360
Almost five years ago now.

124
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:38,360
Drunk driver t-boned her.

125
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:42,220
College kid. Walked away laughin'.

126
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,770
Not a scratch, you know?

127
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:49,150
Not a scratch.

128
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:54,820
So christine kind of took
over for her mom, huh?

129
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,880
Cooked, cleaned, looked
after the little ones?

130
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:01,700
Yeah. Don't know what
we're gonna do now.

131
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:04,520
Christine was arrested last year?

132
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:08,640
That was... Stupid. It was a
couple of joints. No big deal.

133
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:11,070
Well, how is it she got into drugs?

134
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,430
She wasn't into drugs. She
was straightedge, if anything.

135
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,620
It's her dumb-ass friend darlene.

136
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:18,130
Darlene--last
name?

137
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:22,760
Pappas, but chrissy wasn't hanging
out much with darlene anymore,

138
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,210
Not since she got big into surfing.

139
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,130
Then she started hanging
with a different crowd.

140
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,170
Who were they?

141
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,090
They're surfers, you
know-- not like bum surfers.

142
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,690
They seem like good kids,
you know? They were upscale.

143
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:37,010
They'd pick her up in their--
their audis and whatnot.

144
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,530
You know, they were a good
influence on christine.

145
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,430
They helped her with her schoolwork,
and she was thinking about college.

146
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,470
Anybody in particular
vv she was close to?

147
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,300
I don't really know 'em.

148
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,130
I mean, there's names
i'd hear all the time.

149
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:52,920
There's, like, andy and danny and
hope, and then there's this new guy,

150
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:56,410
- flipper, she talked about lately.
- Talks about how?

151
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,290
Just that she was, you know, they
were hangin' together, you know?

152
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,340
Like, "i'll see you at
flipper's," stuff like that.

153
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:05,520
Hey, lisa? Honey?

154
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:06,300
Yeah, dad?

155
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:10,200
Hey, honey, could you, uh, fix
some lunch for your brother, please?

156
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:13,110
- Yeah, okay.
- Thanks.

157
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:29,180
- no, i saw it.
- they're further down the beach.

158
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:56,130
What, you didn't bring a bucket?

159
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,080
- Are you okay?
- Damn it.

160
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,150
- It's gotta be tough.
- What?

161
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:23,620
I mean, a drunk driver-- isn't
that what happened to your mother?

162
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,380
Sorry. It's not my business.

163
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:30,310
We don't discuss our
personal lives in this unit.

164
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,530
It's not useful, and
it's not professional.

165
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:42,900
Cho, names to check-- darlene
pappas, andy, danny, hope and flipper.

166
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,760
Flipper? Okay.

167
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,450
Got it. Hold on.

168
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,110
There's a darlene pappas
in youth authority lockup--

169
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,970
Possession and resisting
arrest. I'll get her in here.

170
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,890
Great. Where's jane?

171
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,950
Jane?

172
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,370
He's still pursuing
inquiries at the beach.

173
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:41,060
Darlene, you're a friend
of christine tanner?

174
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,580
What do you want?

175
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:46,180
Christine's dead.

176
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:49,770
What do you want?

177
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,750
I want you to help us
find out who killed her.

178
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,440
Killed? How?

179
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:58,370
- Drowned.
- Drowned?

180
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,670
Damn.

181
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:02,910
Who does she know that
might have reason to do this?

182
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:09,810
Well, now that you mention
it, there was a guy.

183
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:13,040
What was his name?

184
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,060
Yes, darlene, if you help us,
i'll talk to the prosecutor,

185
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,770
See if we can help you with
these charges you've got pending.

186
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,030
Okay.

187
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,280
Last year she was banging
an older guy, like old.

188
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,350
- She called him "pops."
- No name? Just pops?

189
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,790
Pops, that's it.

190
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,900
One time, uh, she said he was getting
weird, and she was talking about dumping him,

191
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,660
But i don't know if she ever did.

192
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,130
Like i say, we haven't
been tight for a while now.

193
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:46,680
That's interesting, but it's
not enough for a call to the d.a.

194
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:49,150
Did she say anything else about him?

195
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,710
Anything at all?

196
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:58,670
He was good in bed,
and he liked '50s music,

197
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,670
like elvis and stuff. And that's it.

198
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:06,840
Well, that's enough, right?

199
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:09,290
Well, call the d.a.

200
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,810
Got a hit with those deputy interviews.

201
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,730
Philip handler, goes by "flipper."

202
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:18,480
Badass surfer-- it's a long sheet, including
time for assault on a woman a few years back.

203
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:19,180
How bad?

204
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,750
Hundred stitches bad.

205
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,500
- Got an address.
- Let's go.

206
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,850
Philip handler? Police! May
we speak with you, please?

207
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,070
- Mr. Handler?
- Clear.

208
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:15,050
Mr. Handler?

209
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,750
These friends of yours?

210
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,260
Hey, guys, come in. Come in.

211
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:25,570
I'm just about to discredit nimzovich's
theory on the french advance once and for all.

212
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:28,240
Dream on, trick.

213
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,520
What led you to flipper anyway?

214
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:44,300
His hair. It's braided the
exact same way as the victim.

215
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,640
She did his do.

216
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,020
I guess, uh, you must be bad cop.

217
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,740
I try.

218
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:00,380
Tough. Go to it, sister.

219
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,870
You can be pretty tough yourself.

220
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,940
Roberta varnushi.

221
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,380
You did quite a number on her.

222
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,140
Uh, we had...

223
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:13,740
Different expectations
that led to... Friction.

224
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,450
But, um, what can you do?

225
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,950
Friction? She nearly died.

226
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:23,100
Do you know what she was doing that
started the argument when i hit her?

227
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:28,710
She was pouring the sump oil from her
car right into the storm drain, okay?

228
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:32,810
You might as well take an ax and
go chop up a family of dolphins.

229
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,360
Was christine tanner
damaging marine life somehow?

230
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,720
What? No.

231
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:41,670
Chris understood.

232
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,020
Chris was a child of the ocean.

233
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:47,180
You like hanging out
with children, don't you?

234
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:49,260
I do.

235
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:52,950
They're pure in flesh and spirit.

236
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,730
What's not to like?

237
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,590
Christine was a beautiful girl.

238
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,820
Yes, she was.

239
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:03,560
So why'd you kill her?

240
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,020
I didn't kill her.

241
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,390
Why would i kill her?

242
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:11,820
Did you have sex with her?

243
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,910
Oh, i thought about it.
I thought about it a lot.

244
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,760
- But no, i didn't. You know why?
- Why?

245
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:23,630
Because it would be wrong, and
i'm all about doing what's right.

246
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:28,690
I wait until they hit
legal age, then bam!

247
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:32,120
Happy birthday, baby.

248
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,220
When was the last time you saw her?

249
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,700
Oh, so you can try and pin this on me?

250
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:39,470
No, thanks.

251
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,970
See, the thing is, flip, lisbon here is looking at
you like you're a porkchop because you fit the profile.

252
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:48,090
Your life is in chaos. You're
lonely. You're depressed.

253
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:52,640
You're addicted to drugs and pornography
and a little nuts, to be honest.

254
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:56,230
You're exactly the kind of man
that does terrible things to women.

255
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:06,320
Uh, but i don't think you did this.

256
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:09,760
'Cause i think deep
down you're a good man.

257
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:15,620
You should learn to use your bishops a little
more efficiently, but otherwise a good man.

258
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:22,680
I saw chris three days ago--
sunset patrol at devon point break.

259
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:26,490
Was that monday with hope
and win and those guys?

260
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:32,590
Right. We--we rode until dark, and
then we partied a while on the beach.

261
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,160
And then i went home.

262
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:40,890
On my mother's life.

263
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,890
What do you mean, person of interest?

264
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,590
This guy kill my chrissy or what?

265
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,180
Mr. Tanner, if we make an arrest, you'll
be the first person i call, i promise.

266
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:56,330
I'm gonna have somebody take you home.

267
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,950
This him? Is this him?

268
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,370
Calm down, okay? You need to go
home and take care of your children.

269
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:09,660
You're dead, bastard! You're
dead! You're dead, you bastard!

270
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:12,400
Go home now!

271
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:18,010
Look at me. Look at me. Look at me.

272
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:21,540
You need to go home.

273
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:27,660
Let's go home, daddy.

274
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:33,920
come on.

275
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,300
Lisbon.

276
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:51,030
Yeah.

277
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,670
Coroner just told me that christine's body was
put in the water sometime early tuesday morning.

278
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:57,710
So that monday night party is critical.

279
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:00,240
Somebody there had to have known
what happened later that night.

280
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,420
Okay, boss, we're on it.

281
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,070
Hi, people.

282
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:20,100
Oh, thank you very much, ma'am, but,
uh, we don't need a grief counselor.

283
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,420
We know how to grieve.

284
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,590
Good, because i'm not a grief counselor.

285
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,080
The principal didn't want to say "homicide
detective" in front of the other students.

286
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,090
Agent lisbon, california
bureau of investigation.

287
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,350
Hey, guys. Hope and win i know.
You must be danny and andy.

288
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,940
Quick test--if you could be any animal
you want, what would you be? Quick.

289
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:38,990
- Dolphin.
- You?

290
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,310
Uh, same, or, uh, a killer whale.

291
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,150
A gull. No, a hawk.

292
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,320
Uh, uh, a tiger.

293
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:50,160
- Interesting.
- Why?

294
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:53,490
When we spoke before about
monday night at devon point,

295
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,950
You didn't mention that you had
a party after you went surfing.

296
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,540
A party? No, it wasn't a party.

297
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,310
Not what flipper says.

298
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,890
Flipper told? Dude.

299
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,020
Come on, guys. I mean, we--we
partied, threw a little frisbee.

300
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,720
What's the big deal?

301
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:13,050
No big deal. It's just that you were the last
people, aside from her killer, to see christine alive.

302
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,140
She was drowned later that night.

303
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,560
- That night?
- You serious?

304
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:18,710
Oh, my god.

305
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,490
Um, sorry, we have to
go. We have a. P. English.

306
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,500
We'll walk you.

307
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,670
So tell us about this
party monday night.

308
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,870
You didn't say anything
about it before. Why?

309
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,430
And don't lie or i'll know.

310
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,690
We were drinking beer, ma'am.

311
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,320
- Shut up.
- What?

312
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:39,470
We're all gonna be applying
for college soon, all right?

313
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,550
We can't get caught for drinking.

314
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,550
My mom would exterminate me.

315
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,820
Plus we were trespassing.

316
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,160
The beach at devon point is
totally, uh, private property.

317
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:51,920
Danny, what does devon
point mean to you?

318
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,180
Uh, it's...

319
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:58,410
It's my dad's land, and, uh, he's
building these heinous condos.

320
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,780
We go there to spite him, i guess.

321
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,950
Who else was there that night?

322
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,280
Us and flipper, that's all.

323
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,750
It wasn't exactly raging.

324
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,320
We all cut out about 10:00, 10:30 maybe.

325
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:09,410
Chris stayed to clean up.

326
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:12,060
She's all, uh, "save
our oceans," you know?

327
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,390
Did flipper leave then, too?

328
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:16,560
He cut out early, after
we ran out of brews.

329
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:20,100
- Do you think he came back, maybe?
- Like, flipper did it? No.

330
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,750
We shouldn't have left her there, guys.

331
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,710
She wanted to stay.

332
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,870
You ask me, she was meeting somebody.

333
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,670
Shut up, hope. You don't know that.

334
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,790
No, but i think it, and so do you.

335
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:33,780
Danny asked her to go home
with him, and she said no.

336
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,430
You and chris were lovers?

337
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:39,310
Lovers? Uh, no.

338
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,150
- We hooked up on occasion.
- You made love. You were lovers.

339
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,940
No. Uh, i mean, andy was
totally there, too, right, andy?

340
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,460
Yeah.

341
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:50,250
It wasn't a big deal.
We're all just friends.

342
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:54,730
Andy and i hook up with hope, too,
sometimes. Doesn't mean we're... Lovers.

343
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,840
Yeah. That would be weird.

344
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,450
Yeah, i guess.

345
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:03,670
You ever hear of anyone named pops?

346
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,910
- Pops?
- Yeah.

347
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,210
Uh, no.

348
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:13,530
Okay. Well, that's all we
need for now. Thank you.

349
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,320
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

350
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:18,700
- Don't leave town.
- That's a cop joke.

351
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:29,660
How long you gonna be, you think?

352
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:32,610
Mr. Rayburn, christine tanner's
murder may have occurred here.

353
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,090
It takes as long as it takes.

354
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,350
I already got the developer
way up my tailpipe.

355
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,400
We're three weeks behind thanks
to the crappy labor pool here.

356
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:41,970
Economy like this, and people
just don't show up for work?

357
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,140
Boggles my mind.

358
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,080
Anybody not show up lately?

359
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:48,250
Night guard just this
week walked off the job.

360
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:51,700
Cement truck shows up in the morning,
can't get on the freakin' site.

361
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,720
That alone put me back six hours.

362
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,720
- When did he quit?
- Monday.

363
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:57,330
What section were you working then?

364
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,080
Southeast quad.

365
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:00,970
What's his name, the night guard?

366
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,320
Eddie garcia.

367
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:05,270
I got his paperwork in the
site office if you want it.

368
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,910
Jorge! What are you, nuts?
That load goes over here.

369
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,370
- The paperwork?
- Right.

370
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,160
What, you think he might
have, uh, done this murder?

371
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:29,710
Lisbon! Come take a look at this.

372
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,530
What?

373
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,560
Oh, yeah.

374
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:44,450
Mr. Rayburn?

375
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,290
See that?

376
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,240
What is it?

377
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,710
Tip of eddie garcia's nose.

378
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,290
Get out of here.

379
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:11,860
how is it you don't even
notice a nose in your floor?

380
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:15,090
That's what i'm telling you. We're
trying to finish this thing too fast.

381
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,690
What the hell's going on?

382
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:24,610
Oh, for heaven sakes. Is--is
that a person, someone i employ?

383
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,940
We think so.

384
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:29,060
God help me. If it's
not one thing, it's...

385
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:32,110
Mr. Kurtik? Dane kurtik?

386
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,940
Oh, sure. Right, just
talk to my lawyers.

387
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:37,190
As you saw, i have no knowledge
of this regrettable incident.

388
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,250
C. B. I. Serious crimes unit.

389
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:42,630
Serious crimes? The man
fell into wet cement.

390
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,110
If someone had been here with a camera,
he'd be on "america's funniest videos."

391
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,370
Serious crimes? Come on, guys.

392
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,520
I'm sorry, sir. This
is now a crime scene.

393
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:52,380
You're gonna have to suspend work
until we're done investigating.

394
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,980
Suspend work?

395
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:57,180
Hell, i'm calling tommy
alvarez--the sheriff.

396
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,850
We believe this situation is related
to the death of christine tanner.

397
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,760
You know her?

398
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:04,350
I've heard the name, obviously.
It's been on the news.

399
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,830
Your son danny and christine
were close. You never met her?

400
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,740
Maybe i have. My son has a lot of
friends. Is this an interrogation?

401
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,660
- Is it?
- No, sir, it isn't.

402
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:16,780
We appreciate your cooperation.
We'll be in touch, maybe. Thank you.

403
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,850
Hey, pops?

404
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:29,330
Hear you're good in
bed. What's the secret?

405
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:33,110
I don't know what you're talking about,
but you mean to be offensive, I guess,

406
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,340
and you've succeeded very well.

407
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:38,370
And i'm going to be taking this up
with your superiors. What is your name?

408
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,260
- My name is patrick jane...
- Jane, stop.

409
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,940
And i have no superiors.

410
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:44,730
And i'll tell you what i'm talkin'
about, you sweaty little pervert.

411
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:45,370
Jane!

412
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:47,760
You were having sex
with a 15-year-old girl.

413
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:49,780
- Jane, stop.
- I never touched christine tanner.

414
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:50,840
Liar.

415
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:58,000
And believe me when i tell you that you just now
made the worst mistake of your miserable little life.

416
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:02,310
Believe me, no matter how this
turns out, i've made worse mistakes,

417
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:05,150
And you're lying about christine
tanner. You were laying her like carpet.

418
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,450
Arrest him, lisbon. Statutory rape.

419
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,970
With what evidence?

420
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:14,400
He's playing rockabilly. '50s
music. What more do you want?

421
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:18,340
I can only apologize for my
colleague's bizarre behavior. I'm sorry.

422
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:21,340
Lisbon, hush. Don't be so
damn blinkered. Look at him.

423
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,720
He was raping her, all right.

424
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,600
I just don't know yet
whether he killed her as well.

425
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,270
Did you kill her?

426
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:30,210
Look me in the eye and tell me
the truth, you filthy old goat.

427
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,690
Get him!

428
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:36,700
How--how
dare you?

429
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,360
You brought him all
the way back here why?

430
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:45,750
The local sheriff begged me
not to put him in his jail.

431
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,210
Kurtik's a big cheese down there.

432
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,830
That is a signal.

433
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,230
Is that not a signal that
we should cut this man loose?

434
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,420
He hit jane pretty good.
People were watching.

435
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,680
I had to arrest him.

436
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:58,020
This guy is connected. This guy is...

437
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,240
He has the governor's home phone number.

438
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:04,180
And we both know that
jane was asking for it.

439
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:08,560
You couldn't just give kurtik
a stern talking-to instead?

440
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:10,560
What about christine tanner, sir?

441
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:13,460
If kurtik was having sex with
her, that gives him motive to kill.

442
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,010
If, and that's a hunch
based on rockabilly.

443
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:19,970
It's a jane hunch. You keep
him around for a reason.

444
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:24,000
Look, just let us work kurtik
until his lawyer gets here.

445
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:27,150
- Maybe we can get something more.
- All right. Work him gently.

446
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:30,580
Do you have a thing for
youngsters in general, dane?

447
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:33,640
Or was it christine in
particular that appealed to you?

448
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:37,850
That i can understand, because you
know, you meet some 15-year-olds,

449
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:42,170
They're just as smart and mature
and articulate as any adult, right?

450
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,930
They are adults, basically.
Maybe christine was one of them.

451
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:50,360
Are you serious?

452
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:54,000
Do you actually obtain
confessions with that gambit?

453
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:57,930
- All the time.
- Amazing. People are stupid.

454
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:00,520
Listen, i admire cops.I
think you do a great job,

455
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:04,580
and i'm happy to sit here and chat
with you until my lawyer gets here.

456
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:08,720
But i'm not gonna say
anything you want to hear.

457
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:12,290
- So relax, huh?
- He's not, is he?

458
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:15,290
He's not gonna confess.

459
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:18,520
What'd you think, he'd break
under the bad lighting conditions?

460
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,060
Let's go back to devon point.

461
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:20,740
What for?

462
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:24,450
So i can put the second half
of my cunning plan into effect.

463
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:28,260
Jane, wait. What cunning plan?

464
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:30,510
Uh, danny, hi. Patrick jane.

465
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,210
Listen, we need your help.

466
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:35,070
Do you want to help us
catch christine's killer?

467
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,610
Okay, then. Good.

468
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:42,820
Meet me at devon point with
your friends in, uh, two hours.

469
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:44,130
Great.

470
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:46,480
What cunning plan?

471
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:52,940
Just so you know, i'm suing the c.
B. I.And the attorney general's office

472
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:55,560
for wrongful arrest and
unlawful imprisonment,

473
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:59,970
And i will drop this suit when
they fire you and agent lisbon.

474
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,060
Best of luck.

475
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,260
You're not scared of me, huh?

476
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,860
That's a mistake.

477
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:11,460
Keep walking, mr. Kurtik, or i'm
gonna have to arrest you again.

478
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:16,920
If you were 15 years
younger, i'd give you a shot.

479
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:30,000
Mr. Jane?

480
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:32,900
Mr. Jane?

481
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:35,260
Thanks for coming.

482
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:37,410
The police need your help.

483
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:41,410
First christine, then the
security guard. They're at a loss.

484
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:44,200
Did the guard stumble
across chris being killed?

485
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:47,720
Maybe it was some kind of love triangle.

486
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:52,220
Tell me, do you sincerely want to
help catch christine's murderer,

487
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:54,240
Even if the killer is
someone close to you?

488
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,660
- Yes, of course.
- Absolutely.

489
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:02,420
Your friend flipper served time for
assaulting a woman. Did you know that?

490
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:05,450
- It was flipper? He did it?
- Could be.

491
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:12,800
Then again, danny, christine and
your father were having an affair.

492
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,820
- Wait. What?
- Yeah.

493
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:17,660
No way. No, no.
That's--that's ridiculous. No.

494
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:21,570
Danny, get real. We knew. We all knew.

495
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,240
Well, what did you expect
me to do, turn in my own dad?

496
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:35,640
I mean, it's-- it's not like he
forced chris to do it, you know?

497
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:38,850
She--she was--
she was into it.

498
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:42,900
Was it your father you thought she
was going to meet with that night?

499
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:44,720
- Yes.
- No.

500
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,030
Well, i-i don't know.

501
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:54,870
Well, just 'cause they're having an affair
doesn't mean your father killed christine.

502
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:57,430
- It could have been flipper.
- Right.

503
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:59,900
Or someone else.

504
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:03,400
Did--didn't you say you
had a way of finding out?

505
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:10,600
Actually... A way you can find out.

506
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:30,400
I want to hypnotize you all so that
you can remember details of that night.

507
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:32,670
It's safe. I'm fully trained.

508
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,360
Hell, i used to hypnotize
people for a living.

509
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,960
Um, no--no,
thanks.

510
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:39,470
Your subconscious minds may recall
things that could help us find the killer.

511
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,080
Hypnosis will let you
come up with those things.

512
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:46,270
Well, what-- what kind
of things? Who knows?

513
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:50,680
Maybe something chris said, maybe a
glimpse of someone on the bluff there.

514
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:54,760
The smallest detail that you
can recall could be a vital clue.

515
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:57,500
I don't want you messing around
inside my head, man. No offense.

516
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:59,260
Ah, but that's the thing.

517
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:02,630
With hypnosis, i can't
mesmerize you against your will.

518
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,040
It's not possible.

519
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:07,350
You are in control the whole time.

520
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,000
What do you say?

521
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:18,310
Good.

522
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:26,960
I want you to close
your eyes... And listen.

523
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:33,490
Listen only to my voice.

524
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:38,130
Think. Think back to that night.

525
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,210
The bonfire...

526
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:45,410
The sound of the ocean.

527
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:49,170
The sound of the ocean.

528
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:55,810
I don't know what you will recall of that
night, but i know that you will recall something,

529
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:59,490
Because it's all there in your memory.

530
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:05,690
All you have to do is go back,

531
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:10,550
back to that night and be there.

532
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,810
And there you are.

533
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:16,940
What is it, hope? What do you see?

534
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:20,790
I see danny's father
there above the rocks.

535
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,260
- No, you don't.
- What is he doing?

536
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:29,590
Staring at us, at chris.

537
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:32,680
That's it. He's staring.

538
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:35,450
What's wrong with him?

539
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:39,230
Come back, hope.

540
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,340
What--what
happened?

541
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:44,310
You're okay. You did
very well, thank you.

542
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,940
You really saw mr. Kurtik?

543
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:49,210
No, you didn't. You didn't.

544
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:52,250
Danny, i'm sorry. I
can't help what i saw.

545
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,620
My dad didn't kill christine!

546
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:56,290
How do you know he didn't?

547
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,940
Yeah, how do you know?

548
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,100
You know what? Screw
all of you guys, okay?

549
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:06,680
You guys suck!

550
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:10,100
Oh, danny, wait! Don't
be mad! Danny, wait!

551
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,750
D-danny! Come on, stop.

552
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:16,570
Ah, danny's mad. We should go.

553
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:19,260
Screw danny.

554
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:22,370
His dad killed christine.

555
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:27,730
Yeah, well, it's late anyway.

556
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:30,460
- Thanks for your help, guys.
- No problemo.

557
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:44,680
So what do you think? Did it work?

558
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:50,070
I think... Three, two, one...

559
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,280
Now.

560
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:58,440
How cool would it have been if
one had walked in right then, huh?

561
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:05,570
Did you arrest him? Did he confess?

562
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:08,060
Mr. Kurtik? No.

563
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:12,210
Thing is, hope, mr. Kurtik has a
cast-iron alibi for that evening.

564
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:15,910
So you couldn't have seen him
standing there on that bluff.

565
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,990
But that's so weird.

566
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:21,600
In my trance, i saw him clear as day.

567
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:24,590
- Maybe it's symbolic.
- You want symbolic?

568
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:28,670
You're a hawk, and
christine was a rabbit.

569
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,040
What does that even mean?

570
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:35,180
Bird of prey, rabbit... You tell me.

571
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:38,550
What it means is you never
liked christine tanner.

572
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,830
Not true!

573
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:44,100
What it means is i never
really hypnotized you.

574
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:49,680
You pretended to be in a trance to give us
a fake story and incriminate an innocent man.

575
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:54,440
No! no.

576
00:35:56,890 --> 00:36:00,450
- Just tell us what happened that night.
- From the beginning.

577
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:05,630
Flipper had already
left, wasted as usual.

578
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:23,820
the guard told us to get
out, or he'd call the cops.

579
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:27,110
Danny told him to step
off. His dad owns the place.

580
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:40,240
he's dead.

581
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:45,060
He didn't mean to. It was an accident.

582
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:47,740
We couldn't help the guard, see?

583
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:49,380
But danny we could.

584
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:53,770
So we all promised not
to tell, all of us...

585
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:58,720
Except chris. Not chris.

586
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:04,240
You've gotta understand, everything danny had
worked for his whole life was just washing away

587
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:07,490
Because chris has to do the right thing.

588
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:17,150
he just hit her over the head,
and then she was still moving,

589
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,610
So he dragged her to
the trough there and...

590
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:25,540
Drowned her in it, held her
under until she stopped moving.

591
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:31,640
and you, win and andy didn't
say a word-- two people murdered.

592
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,240
What if i was next?

593
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:38,130
I've never seen danny like that.

594
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:41,190
He was like a different
person or something.

595
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,560
Okay. You're safe now.

596
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:48,570
excuse us.

597
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:08,050
I-i can't let my dad be punished for something
he didn't do, no matter what a tool he is.

598
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,530
So you're confessing.

599
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:13,530
We know it was you that
killed christine and the guard.

600
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:17,770
What? No, no, no, that's
not right. Who told you that?

601
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:22,000
It's so completely not
true that it's insane.

602
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:24,070
How can you do this?

603
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:27,150
- I mean, i-i knew you had a cold
streak, but this? - Danny, i'm sorry.

604
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,330
I had to tell the truth.

605
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:33,240
You're only making it worse by
lying. You're only deceiving yourself.

606
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,640
It was her, okay?

607
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:43,340
It was her who killed chris.

608
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:46,700
Hope was jealous of her ever since
she started hanging out with us.

609
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:49,380
Used to be hope who was all that.

610
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:54,240
Then chris came along, and we only hooked
up with hope when chris wasn't around.

611
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:56,390
That's so distorted and not true!

612
00:38:56,420 --> 00:39:00,020
No, i am telling the truth now.

613
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:03,790
The security guard...

614
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:05,300
Just take him!

615
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,060
It was an accident.

616
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,230
And then chris said she
was gonna call the police.

617
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:12,790
She--she said we couldn't cover
it up because it'd be wrong.

618
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,210
Then hope-- i-i
don't even know.

619
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:18,750
Hope just went crazy...

620
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:22,870
Hit her! She hit her!

621
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,970
I did it for you,
jerk! I did it for you!

622
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:31,110
She was doing his dad!

623
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:35,630
She's acting as a judge over his
life, telling him his life is over

624
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:41,340
And that he's going to jail because
she's--she's gotta show integrity and morals.

625
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:48,200
She was a prissy, hypocritical bitch,
and she was gonna ruin his life.

626
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,330
It was flipper.

627
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:07,490
Oh, really?

628
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,400
Yeah, it was flipper.

629
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:12,560
What if i said it was you,
andy? You killed christine.

630
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:16,230
What? That's bull. That's ridiculous.

631
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:25,240
Have a seat.

632
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:29,670
Don't be shy.

633
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:33,500
I didn't kill her, man.

634
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,450
Sure you did.

635
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,080
So did you... And you...

636
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,890
And you.

637
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,260
All four of you killed her.

638
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:49,500
Hope was always smarter than any of you.

639
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:53,040
You never appreciated that.

640
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:06,860
She made all of you take part to
make all of you equally guilty,

641
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:10,330
So that no one could tell on the others.

642
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:14,570
And now you're all equally under arrest.

643
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:16,300
you have the right to remain silent.

644
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:20,120
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

645
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:23,410
You have the right to an
attorney. If you cannot...

646
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,680
statutory rape, huh?

647
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:31,800
What'll he get?

648
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:35,550
He probably won't serve time,
not without christine's testimony.

649
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:38,120
But we'll have fun trying.

650
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,440
You have good kids.

651
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,320
Yeah. I do.

652
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:51,220
You're all they have.

653
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:54,770
Yeah, i know.

654
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,710
Be good to them.

655
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,870
I am good to them.

656
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:07,820
My father was a good
man, just like you are.

657
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:12,710
And after my mother died, he was a
self-pitying drunk just like you are.

658
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:16,840
He killed himself--damn near
killed me and my brothers, too.

659
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:23,990
Get some help. Your kids
deserve it. So do you.
