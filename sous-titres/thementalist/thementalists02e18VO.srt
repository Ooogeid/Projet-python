1
00:00:11,894 --> 00:00:12,678
Agents?

2
00:00:14,512 --> 00:00:15,473
Agent Hightower.

3
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:21,103
Narcotics needs help.
I said I could spare two of you.

4
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:22,897
Sure. We'll get it.

5
00:00:27,673 --> 00:00:28,923
What's the job?

6
00:00:47,486 --> 00:00:49,354
It's hard to believe
there's intel in these.

7
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:51,208
There better be.
It's dripping on my feet.

8
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,342
Hightower knows about Rigsby and me.

9
00:00:53,467 --> 00:00:54,428
Noticed that.

10
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:57,309
She hasn't said anything.
Why do you think that is?

11
00:00:57,965 --> 00:00:58,965
No idea.

12
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:01,059
- If you could guess.
- I wouldn't.

13
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,363
I can't stop thinking about it.

14
00:01:05,984 --> 00:01:07,809
That's just
gonna get you in trouble.

15
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,238
Can you help me?

16
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,097
Can you help me?

17
00:01:15,027 --> 00:01:15,994
What happened?

18
00:01:17,032 --> 00:01:18,282
I lost my shoe.

19
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:21,377
- Can you tell me where I am?
- I'm gonna call this in.

20
00:01:21,961 --> 00:01:23,497
- Ma'am.
- Can you...

21
00:01:26,324 --> 00:01:28,546
We're gonna get you
some medical attention. Come on.

22
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:29,714
Sit down.

23
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,028
What's your name?

24
00:01:41,157 --> 00:01:44,402
She can't remember who she is,
where she came from or what happened.

25
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,464
No ID.
Nothing on her at all.

26
00:01:46,589 --> 00:01:47,542
Where's Lisbon?

27
00:01:47,667 --> 00:01:49,907
She's on her way.
EMT think the bullet

28
00:01:50,032 --> 00:01:52,464
grazed the victim's head.
We should talk to her here.

29
00:01:52,589 --> 00:01:54,644
She lost her shoe,
she couldn't have walked far.

30
00:01:54,769 --> 00:01:56,975
- The crime scene's probably near by.
- Good thinking.

31
00:01:57,767 --> 00:01:59,729
So should we wait for Lisbon or...

32
00:02:02,475 --> 00:02:03,289
Hi.

33
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:06,709
I'm Patrick Jane.
How you doing?

34
00:02:07,034 --> 00:02:08,234
My head hurts.

35
00:02:10,027 --> 00:02:11,827
I don't remember who I am.

36
00:02:17,534 --> 00:02:18,596
Hold my hand.

37
00:02:19,846 --> 00:02:21,801
I'm gonna try
and help with the pain.

38
00:02:22,197 --> 00:02:24,810
I want you to concentrate
and let the pain flow

39
00:02:24,988 --> 00:02:27,310
out through your arm
and into my hand.

40
00:02:28,003 --> 00:02:29,834
Just let it flow, like water.

41
00:02:32,676 --> 00:02:34,820
I can feel it.
Can you feel that?

42
00:02:37,192 --> 00:02:38,899
Can you feel it flowing?

43
00:02:39,118 --> 00:02:40,868
The pain is flowing away.

44
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,034
Tell me your name.

45
00:02:47,085 --> 00:02:48,185
Don't reach.

46
00:02:48,678 --> 00:02:50,028
Just wait for it.

47
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,880
I can't.

48
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:55,259
That's okay.

49
00:02:57,975 --> 00:03:00,179
What were you doing this morning,
before you got hurt?

50
00:03:01,537 --> 00:03:03,665
- I can't.
- It's okay. Don't worry.

51
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:06,852
Before my friends found you,
what were you doing?

52
00:03:09,304 --> 00:03:10,604
I was in a room.

53
00:03:11,323 --> 00:03:12,323
It's cold.

54
00:03:14,316 --> 00:03:15,569
Can you see anything?

55
00:03:18,523 --> 00:03:19,723
It's too dark.

56
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,034
Were you sitting in a chair
or you lying down?

57
00:03:23,824 --> 00:03:26,146
- Lying down.
- On the floor or on the bed?

58
00:03:26,982 --> 00:03:29,030
On the floor.
There's...

59
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:31,659
dirt and...

60
00:03:32,066 --> 00:03:33,066
straw.

61
00:03:36,408 --> 00:03:37,945
It makes me cough.

62
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,427
What does it smell like?

63
00:03:41,089 --> 00:03:42,054
Horses.

64
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:44,390
That's fantastic.

65
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,976
We're looking for a stable.

66
00:04:00,872 --> 00:04:01,872
Her shoe.

67
00:04:07,363 --> 00:04:08,963
Yeah, that's her shoe.

68
00:04:26,774 --> 00:04:28,974
There's a light switch right here.

69
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:46,911
<i>2x18
Aingavite Baa</i>

70
00:04:56,626 --> 00:04:59,489
The bullet creased her skull.
It didn't fracture the bone,

71
00:05:00,275 --> 00:05:02,979
but a hit like that can knock you around
something wicked.

72
00:05:03,104 --> 00:05:04,963
She could have been
unconscious for a while.

73
00:05:05,088 --> 00:05:07,948
Shooter probably thought she was dead
and dumped her with the bodies.

74
00:05:08,073 --> 00:05:09,224
And the amnesia?

75
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:11,042
I don't know what to tell you.

76
00:05:11,167 --> 00:05:13,854
Retrograde amnesia
usually recedes with time,

77
00:05:14,453 --> 00:05:16,273
but I don't know
how fast that'll happen.

78
00:05:16,668 --> 00:05:19,318
What I want you to do
is just focus on the queen.

79
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:20,786
Here's the lady.

80
00:05:20,911 --> 00:05:22,404
Now You saw where she is.

81
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:26,283
There's the lady.
Okay. Now tell me...

82
00:05:28,236 --> 00:05:29,636
Where's the queen?

83
00:05:30,426 --> 00:05:32,289
Wrong.
First boy you ever kissed.

84
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:35,251
- I don't know.
- What's your first name?

85
00:05:36,277 --> 00:05:37,670
I don't know. I'm sorry.

86
00:05:38,325 --> 00:05:40,839
There she was. She was always there.
Right in the middle.

87
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,466
And the point being?

88
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:44,804
I'm just making sure
she has amnesia,

89
00:05:44,929 --> 00:05:46,512
which, by the way, you do.

90
00:05:46,831 --> 00:05:49,556
It's hard to lie when you're thinking
about something else.

91
00:05:50,127 --> 00:05:50,933
Great.

92
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:53,717
We're checking
our missing persons database,

93
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,536
then we'll run your prints.
Something will probably come up.

94
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:58,941
Find somebody
to come in and print her.

95
00:06:02,082 --> 00:06:05,421
I want to see you,
Van Pelt and Rigsby in my office.

96
00:06:06,683 --> 00:06:08,919
I've been meaning
to address this issue for a while,

97
00:06:09,044 --> 00:06:12,037
but there's been so much coming,
I haven't had the time.

98
00:06:13,438 --> 00:06:15,464
First off, neither of you is denying

99
00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:17,714
you're in a sexual relationship?

100
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,272
Are you?

101
00:06:20,966 --> 00:06:23,216
You work together,
you develop feelings.

102
00:06:23,476 --> 00:06:25,575
Nothing wrong with that.
But you know very well

103
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,846
it's against CBI rules,
like I tell my kids, rules are rules.

104
00:06:29,786 --> 00:06:32,516
If you want to stay together,
that's your choice.

105
00:06:32,765 --> 00:06:35,144
But one of you has
to transfer out of the unit.

106
00:06:35,772 --> 00:06:38,647
If you both want to stay in the unit,
then you can't be together.

107
00:06:39,853 --> 00:06:41,253
That's what it is.

108
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:44,153
Give me your decision
tomorrow at the latest.

109
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:49,074
Questions?

110
00:06:56,348 --> 00:06:57,548
Stay a moment.

111
00:06:59,101 --> 00:07:01,524
Why didn't you handle
this situation yourself?

112
00:07:02,194 --> 00:07:05,090
- I won't defend what I did...
- I understand these two sneaking around

113
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,058
but you're their superior.

114
00:07:07,183 --> 00:07:08,385
I expect more.

115
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:13,882
I'll be writing a corrective memo.

116
00:07:15,013 --> 00:07:16,989
That's it.
Thank you for your time.

117
00:07:26,227 --> 00:07:27,713
I don't want to talk about it.

118
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,286
- Where are we with the victims?
- I verified the two ID we found.

119
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,371
Janine and Mitchell Langham
from Chico.

120
00:07:36,749 --> 00:07:38,950
Both in their 50s,
no family in state.

121
00:07:39,075 --> 00:07:41,335
Neighbor said they were hiking
in Kasten State forest.

122
00:07:41,626 --> 00:07:44,494
100 miles from where we found them.
What about the third victim?

123
00:07:44,619 --> 00:07:46,882
Same as the Jane Doe.
No ID of any kind.

124
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,968
The coroner says he's in his early 20s.
I check his prints.

125
00:07:50,346 --> 00:07:52,304
Van Pelt,
did you get any hits on them?

126
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:55,140
I'll check. I'll check.

127
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:57,044
They were shot
with a high-powered rifle,

128
00:07:57,169 --> 00:07:58,391
The Langhams up close,

129
00:07:58,516 --> 00:08:00,854
our Jane Doe and the unidentified male
from a distance.

130
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,914
Do either of the Langhams
have a record?

131
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,619
I think we can set the Langhams aside.
They were by-products.

132
00:08:06,126 --> 00:08:07,917
- Weren't planned.
- Oh?

133
00:08:10,249 --> 00:08:12,322
The first two victims
were shot from a distance,

134
00:08:12,447 --> 00:08:14,753
ID were taken.
Two victims were shot up-close.

135
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,578
ID were not taken.
Clearly,

136
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,539
the first two victims
were the targets.

137
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:21,344
When the Langhams roll up
to the scene, wrong place, wrong time.

138
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,669
Killer shoots the Langhams,

139
00:08:24,011 --> 00:08:26,759
freaks out. Doesn't bother
to take their ID.

140
00:08:26,884 --> 00:08:29,540
Doesn't even notice that one
of the first victims that he shot

141
00:08:29,786 --> 00:08:30,843
was only wounded.

142
00:08:31,176 --> 00:08:33,366
We got a hit
on the male victim's prints.

143
00:08:33,667 --> 00:08:35,724
His name's Leonard Railton,
native american,

144
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,487
lived on the Storm River
reservation.

145
00:08:37,612 --> 00:08:39,396
That's right next
to the State forest.

146
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:42,185
He's been in and out of the system
since his early teens.

147
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:44,610
Mostly small stuff,
a couple of drug busts.

148
00:08:45,085 --> 00:08:47,901
No family listed. His emergency contact
is his parole officer.

149
00:08:48,501 --> 00:08:51,989
Go show Jane Doe a picture of Leonard
and the Langhams. It's worth a shot.

150
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,440
You check out the trail
that the Langhams were hiking.

151
00:08:54,565 --> 00:08:56,618
It sounds like
something's going on up there.

152
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,537
Let's go talk to Railton's P.O.

153
00:09:01,844 --> 00:09:04,482
There's no point in hiding
your frustration with Hightower.

154
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:08,547
Sooner or later, you're just gonna
explode with suppressed rage.

155
00:09:09,238 --> 00:09:11,051
With any luck, you'll be next to me.

156
00:09:11,581 --> 00:09:13,412
That's what I'm worried about.

157
00:09:15,866 --> 00:09:16,866
You okay?

158
00:09:17,002 --> 00:09:18,002
Sure.

159
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,990
- You?
- This is a good thing.

160
00:09:22,115 --> 00:09:24,521
No more sneaking around.
We've to decide what we wanna do.

161
00:09:24,869 --> 00:09:27,403
- Do we know what that is?
- Let's just get through the day.

162
00:09:27,528 --> 00:09:30,314
Tonight, we'll open up a bottle of wine
and we'll talk, okay?

163
00:09:30,439 --> 00:09:31,819
Yeah. Sounds good.

164
00:09:32,707 --> 00:09:33,572
I love you.

165
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:34,914
I love you.

166
00:09:38,923 --> 00:09:40,781
I thought leonard
had a chance, you know?

167
00:09:41,692 --> 00:09:45,136
Good kid. Really trying
not to repeat old mistakes.

168
00:09:45,577 --> 00:09:47,920
How long
were you Leonard's parole officer?

169
00:09:48,609 --> 00:09:50,047
A little over a year.

170
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:51,738
Any family we should speak to?

171
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,856
No, Leonard didn't have anybody.

172
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:56,418
But his mother was shoshone,
grew up on the reservation.

173
00:09:56,543 --> 00:09:59,224
That's why I got him to move there
after he was released.

174
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:00,606
Why the reservation?

175
00:10:01,344 --> 00:10:03,976
Leonard need people in his life
who cared about him.

176
00:10:04,101 --> 00:10:06,480
He could get that there.
It's a small community.

177
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:08,565
- Not too well-off, but tight.
- You live there?

178
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,718
My father's clan is from there.
I'm shoshone.

179
00:10:12,086 --> 00:10:13,692
Shoshone, with a

180
00:10:14,589 --> 00:10:17,689
New York Italian/Irish thing going on,
if I'm not mistaken by the accent.

181
00:10:17,814 --> 00:10:19,542
Is that from your mother's side?

182
00:10:20,948 --> 00:10:23,854
I'm not the first person who need time
to figure out who she was.

183
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:26,708
Were there indications
that Leonard was doing anything illegal?

184
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,846
He had some problems
when he first got there,

185
00:10:31,754 --> 00:10:35,319
but about six months ago,
he settled down, got a job,

186
00:10:35,444 --> 00:10:37,760
- had a girlfriend in the valley.
- What was her name?

187
00:10:38,264 --> 00:10:41,342
Derrien Hopwood.
I met her a couple of times.

188
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:42,754
No record.

189
00:10:43,218 --> 00:10:44,685
Good influence, I thought.

190
00:10:45,306 --> 00:10:46,228
Is this her?

191
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,650
- I don't know this woman.
- Positive?

192
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:53,853
- I said no.
- I got it.

193
00:10:57,049 --> 00:10:59,908
Does Leonard have any friends
on the reservation we should talk to?

194
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,981
- You're going on the rez?
- Yeah.

195
00:11:02,302 --> 00:11:04,163
Will the tribal police be with you?

196
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:07,223
They know for the investigation.
Wekeep them in the loop.

197
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,339
- I should go with you.
- That's not necessary.

198
00:11:11,367 --> 00:11:13,088
As far as they are concerned,

199
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:14,423
you're foreigners.

200
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,750
Foreigners with badges.
You won't get anything.

201
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,242
I'll get my coat.

202
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,138
Excellent.

203
00:11:21,773 --> 00:11:23,432
We got ourselves a native guide.

204
00:11:26,306 --> 00:11:27,811
Janine and Mitchell Langham.

205
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,716
- Ring any bells?
- No, but I don't really

206
00:11:29,841 --> 00:11:31,648
meet people
unless they're in trouble.

207
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,398
These people got into trouble.

208
00:11:33,523 --> 00:11:35,853
Any reports of crime on the trails?
Robberies, assaults?

209
00:11:35,978 --> 00:11:39,535
No, just raccoons, birds, deer,
rattlesnakes, bear.

210
00:11:39,788 --> 00:11:42,075
I don't think a bear shot 4 people
with a rifle.

211
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,096
No, bears can't do that.

212
00:11:44,221 --> 00:11:46,851
Their neighbor said the Langhams
would've walked the Morningstar trail.

213
00:11:46,976 --> 00:11:49,284
Morningstar
is not one of our more popular trails.

214
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,460
Excuse me. I got...

215
00:11:51,863 --> 00:11:53,755
Tisdale, stand by one.

216
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:57,131
I gotta go, up the hill there.
We have an animal control issue.

217
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,114
- We have check out that trail.
- Okay.

218
00:12:00,409 --> 00:12:02,220
The trailhead is right over there.

219
00:12:02,419 --> 00:12:03,753
You just stay on the path.

220
00:12:03,878 --> 00:12:05,891
When you get to the fork,
you go to the left.

221
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:08,518
Just stay to the left.
You'll be fine.

222
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:10,327
Got it. Left. Thanks.

223
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,330
I don't recognize
any of this people.

224
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:17,290
- Take your time. Think about it.
- I have.

225
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,446
They're all dead,

226
00:12:20,654 --> 00:12:21,406
Right?

227
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,758
There's one piece of good news.

228
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:29,247
We ran you through the fingerprints
database. You're not there.

229
00:12:29,743 --> 00:12:31,415
How is that good news?

230
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,218
It means you're not a criminal...

231
00:12:33,568 --> 00:12:35,891
Or you're a very, very good one.

232
00:12:43,071 --> 00:12:44,697
How's it going with the...

233
00:12:46,611 --> 00:12:48,745
Missing persons thing?

234
00:12:50,276 --> 00:12:53,247
No one's filed a missing persons report
fitting your description yet,

235
00:12:53,678 --> 00:12:56,874
- I'm sure it's just a matter of time.
- You don't know that.

236
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,067
You had a job to do,
and you did it. Thanks.

237
00:13:01,436 --> 00:13:02,707
You don't have to stay.

238
00:13:03,309 --> 00:13:04,416
I'll stick around.

239
00:13:07,609 --> 00:13:08,609
Okay.

240
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,310
Thanks.

241
00:13:12,435 --> 00:13:14,224
I've got a lot of time
invested here,

242
00:13:14,349 --> 00:13:16,614
but if she leaves,
we're into this whole sexism thing

243
00:13:16,739 --> 00:13:18,308
of whose job is more important.

244
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,741
- Like I said, it's complicated.
- No, it isn't.

245
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,606
- What?
- Which do you want more,

246
00:13:22,731 --> 00:13:23,975
your job or Van Pelt?

247
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,601
- What? It's not that easy.
- Sure it is.

248
00:13:26,853 --> 00:13:28,983
- This is the fork, right
- No, we took the fork.

249
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,184
That was'nt the fork.
This is the fork.

250
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,679
Whatever. Go left.

251
00:13:33,493 --> 00:13:34,744
It's not that simple.

252
00:13:34,869 --> 00:13:37,056
Job or Van Pelt.
All there is to it.

253
00:13:49,716 --> 00:13:53,081
The rec center's the community gathering
spot. Leonard used to come here.

254
00:13:58,061 --> 00:13:59,588
This is Joseph Silverwing.

255
00:13:59,837 --> 00:14:01,564
He helped to settle Leonard in here.

256
00:14:01,689 --> 00:14:03,066
He's on the tribal council.

257
00:14:03,191 --> 00:14:05,760
These are the detectives
from CBI I called you about.

258
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,179
Teresa lisbon. Hi.

259
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:11,635
We're investigating
the murder of Leonard Railton.

260
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,330
- Can you tell us anything about him?
- He's a good kid.

261
00:14:14,455 --> 00:14:17,105
- Worked hard. Stayed out of trouble.
- We heard he had a job.

262
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,983
Down at, Markham Willis's place.

263
00:14:20,307 --> 00:14:22,709
It's a souvenir shop
just off the reservation.

264
00:14:23,418 --> 00:14:25,071
Was Leonard having any problems?

265
00:14:27,587 --> 00:14:29,785
Did you hear
about any arguments or fights?

266
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,297
Money problems?
Health issues?

267
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,198
You're right.
You really are opening things up here.

268
00:14:37,323 --> 00:14:40,837
Do you know about any relationships
he was having off the reservation maybe?

269
00:14:49,995 --> 00:14:51,123
Nice shot.

270
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:55,852
Did you guys know Railton?

271
00:14:58,696 --> 00:15:00,322
I'll take that as a yes.

272
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:02,734
I'm trying to find who killed him.

273
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,110
You want to help me?

274
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:07,948
Don't all speak at once.

275
00:15:08,264 --> 00:15:09,622
Who's gonna talk first?

276
00:15:10,526 --> 00:15:11,910
We don't talk to Po-Po.

277
00:15:14,412 --> 00:15:15,412
I like that.

278
00:15:15,717 --> 00:15:17,229
But I'm not Po-Po.
I'm a

279
00:15:17,621 --> 00:15:19,051
Po-Po consultant.

280
00:15:19,484 --> 00:15:20,544
How about this?

281
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:21,820
I bet

282
00:15:22,097 --> 00:15:23,433
that I can sink a ball

283
00:15:24,136 --> 00:15:25,801
before your best player can,

284
00:15:26,984 --> 00:15:28,062
and he can have

285
00:15:28,478 --> 00:15:31,068
three chances to my one,
and if I lose...

286
00:15:32,463 --> 00:15:33,265
50 bucks.

287
00:15:33,611 --> 00:15:34,494
Okay?

288
00:15:34,619 --> 00:15:35,619
But if I win,

289
00:15:36,177 --> 00:15:38,103
you tell me about Leonard.

290
00:15:39,345 --> 00:15:40,355
We got a deal?

291
00:15:40,778 --> 00:15:42,774
Great.
Who's your sharpshooter?

292
00:15:43,298 --> 00:15:44,837
It's you, isn't it, shorty?

293
00:15:44,962 --> 00:15:46,052
Let's do this.

294
00:15:46,661 --> 00:15:47,487
All right.

295
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,145
First ball in wins.

296
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:51,372
You get three chances.

297
00:15:51,981 --> 00:15:53,071
I get one.

298
00:15:54,198 --> 00:15:55,203
And by the way,

299
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,455
that girl you crushing on,
in the blue sweater

300
00:15:57,828 --> 00:15:59,124
It's never gonna happen.

301
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,154
She's into the tall guy.
Good luck.

302
00:16:01,564 --> 00:16:03,122
My money's on the kid.

303
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:07,549
One.

304
00:16:11,474 --> 00:16:12,235
Two.

305
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,264
Last time. Good luck.
Lucky last.

306
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:17,809
That's three.

307
00:16:18,592 --> 00:16:20,270
There's a hole in that ball.

308
00:16:21,307 --> 00:16:22,857
Here's the hard part.

309
00:16:36,318 --> 00:16:37,329
Schooled ya.

310
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,791
So, what was Leonard's story?

311
00:16:43,081 --> 00:16:44,081
He had money.

312
00:16:44,772 --> 00:16:45,772
A lot of it.

313
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,590
- Always had the newest kicks.
- Since when?

314
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,551
Like, six months ago.

315
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,951
I heard he had a job.

316
00:16:54,766 --> 00:16:56,410
At Willis's souvenir shop?

317
00:16:57,453 --> 00:16:58,703
That's pennies.

318
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:00,520
Leonard had money.

319
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:02,687
Any idea
where that might have come from?

320
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:03,855
He wouldn't say.

321
00:17:04,938 --> 00:17:07,278
But he was out
in the woods all the time, so...

322
00:17:07,723 --> 00:17:09,034
we figured, you know?

323
00:17:12,697 --> 00:17:14,607
Everybody knows
what goes on in the woods.

324
00:17:14,732 --> 00:17:15,950
Sure.
The woods.

325
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:17,977
Yeah, this is not the trail.

326
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:21,081
- It's over here.
- You sure? I thought I saw it here.

327
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:25,877
Water tank?

328
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,414
There's a pot plant here.

329
00:17:36,437 --> 00:17:38,723
There's a whole bunch
of pot plants here.

330
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,206
It looks like a farm.

331
00:17:40,861 --> 00:17:43,405
Which means there's probably
some bad guys with guns.

332
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,181
No bars.

333
00:17:50,485 --> 00:17:52,092
So much for backup.

334
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,775
There's only one shooter.
You draw fire,

335
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,718
and I'll take him from the side.
Ready?

336
00:18:22,712 --> 00:18:24,102
- Clear!
- Got it!

337
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:39,451
It's the kind of farm you find all over
public lands, about an acre of plants,

338
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,912
- irrigation pipes everywhere.
- Tapping into water from up the valley.

339
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,109
- You hit him? Maybe he's in a hospital.
- Didn't see any blood.

340
00:18:46,234 --> 00:18:49,475
You think the ranger directed you
toward the pot farm? Was this a setup?

341
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,047
Hard to say. We got turned around.
I'm not sure we were on the trail.

342
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,946
- Where's the ranger?
- In the mountains.

343
00:18:55,071 --> 00:18:57,594
- He's out of calling range.
- Find out when he's back.

344
00:18:57,762 --> 00:19:00,472
So it looks like Railton
was working for the pot farmers.

345
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,665
There's a hundred ways
that turn ugly.

346
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:06,826
If Leonard was farmin' the weed,
he would've told his friends.

347
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,561
Whatever he was doing,
he felt shame or ambivalence.

348
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:12,799
Which takes the investigation where?

349
00:19:13,347 --> 00:19:16,112
- We haven't spoken to the girlfriend.
- So go do that.

350
00:19:16,471 --> 00:19:18,298
Talk to narcotics.
See if there's a line

351
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:20,531
on marijuana players in that area.

352
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,598
You heard what she said.

353
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:26,956
We weren't living together,

354
00:19:27,438 --> 00:19:28,692
just hanging out.

355
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:31,211
So Leonard isn't the baby's father?

356
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:32,612
Kai's father?

357
00:19:34,754 --> 00:19:35,840
I know, honey.

358
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,392
But Leonard liked your little boy,
didn't he?

359
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:40,929
Sure.

360
00:19:42,988 --> 00:19:44,605
He's bought most of the toys here.

361
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:45,725
And this...

362
00:19:46,843 --> 00:19:48,156
Enormous stack

363
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:49,644
of infant formula.

364
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,731
Like, 1,000 bucks worth.

365
00:19:53,417 --> 00:19:54,984
What's the story with that?

366
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,820
It's because Kai got this rash.

367
00:19:57,506 --> 00:19:59,850
It was going around.
A couple of kids had it.

368
00:20:00,841 --> 00:20:03,493
He had this idea
it was the powdered formula.

369
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,927
He made me throw all
the powdered out,

370
00:20:06,513 --> 00:20:09,040
which is crazy, 'cause it's cheaper,

371
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,251
and it's real easy to use.

372
00:20:11,653 --> 00:20:12,654
All you do

373
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,020
is add water.

374
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,380
How's the rash?

375
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,484
All gone.

376
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:22,843
I guess he was right.

377
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:26,138
You weren't surprised
to hear about him, were you?

378
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,602
You cared for him, but you weren't
startled to learn that he was dead.

379
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,842
He had money, and...

380
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:37,114
not from
that lame souvenir store job.

381
00:20:37,718 --> 00:20:40,468
He wouldn't tell me
where he was gettin' it.

382
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,783
My experience is,
that means trouble.

383
00:20:44,849 --> 00:20:47,161
- Your best guess?
- I don't know.

384
00:20:48,057 --> 00:20:49,912
Whatever else he was doing...

385
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,669
he was always good to me and Kai.

386
00:20:54,298 --> 00:20:55,670
He was a good man.

387
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,922
You find who did this.

388
00:20:58,224 --> 00:20:59,966
We'll do everything we can.

389
00:21:09,933 --> 00:21:11,835
How long was Leonard working here?

390
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,013
I guess about six months.

391
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:17,567
I hired him on Dolores Brinton's
recommendation.

392
00:21:18,755 --> 00:21:20,031
He was a great kid,

393
00:21:20,661 --> 00:21:23,622
- good worker.
- That's what I'm talking about.

394
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:26,537
Pretty great, no?

395
00:21:26,662 --> 00:21:28,549
This is fantastic.
Do you deliver?

396
00:21:28,674 --> 00:21:30,462
- As a matter of fact, we do.
- All right.

397
00:21:30,782 --> 00:21:31,706
Put it back.

398
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:32,749
What?

399
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,459
You heard me. Now.

400
00:21:35,763 --> 00:21:36,586
Okay.

401
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,503
- Now!
- All right.

402
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:42,877
We think that, Leonard was getting money
from someplace else.

403
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:44,952
Any idea what that was about?

404
00:21:45,077 --> 00:21:47,205
No. He never said a word about it.

405
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:49,474
- What was he doing?
- We're still working on that.

406
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,382
I can give you a deal
on that bonnet.

407
00:21:51,873 --> 00:21:53,986
Special law enforcement discount.

408
00:21:55,057 --> 00:21:57,857
You're not self-conscious
about peddling your own culture, you?

409
00:21:58,969 --> 00:22:00,360
This is not my culture.

410
00:22:01,023 --> 00:22:03,578
This war bonnet is
from the laguna people.

411
00:22:04,311 --> 00:22:06,300
It has nothing to do
with us shoshone.

412
00:22:06,582 --> 00:22:08,117
It's kind of a pastiche, really.

413
00:22:08,616 --> 00:22:12,247
But that's what you americans
want to buy, so that's what I sell.

414
00:22:12,476 --> 00:22:14,176
Thank you for your time.

415
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,546
I'll come.

416
00:22:25,285 --> 00:22:27,053
Is there some kind of service
for Leonard?

417
00:22:27,341 --> 00:22:28,846
Tomorrow afternoon, I believe.

418
00:22:29,937 --> 00:22:31,339
That's such a shame.

419
00:22:32,574 --> 00:22:34,074
I'm gonna take that.

420
00:22:34,694 --> 00:22:36,134
And I like this one, too.

421
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:39,572
It's really beautiful.
So that as well, and...

422
00:22:41,706 --> 00:22:44,010
This thing. I'll see
if I can get a tune out of that.

423
00:22:44,402 --> 00:22:45,858
Just love those feathers.

424
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:50,985
Hi. It's jane.

425
00:22:51,241 --> 00:22:53,955
How's it going with Jane Doe there?
She get a clue yet?

426
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:55,795
Didn't think so.

427
00:22:56,052 --> 00:22:58,154
You know, bring her
down to the office.

428
00:22:58,279 --> 00:23:01,125
I think we're gonna have to get
a little more interventionist.

429
00:23:02,953 --> 00:23:06,275
If you start to feel dizzy
or woozy or anything.

430
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:08,930
Quit hovering.

431
00:23:10,105 --> 00:23:12,566
- She's fine.
- I took her out of the hospital, Jane.

432
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:15,214
- She's my responsibility.
- I get that, but she's fine.

433
00:23:15,339 --> 00:23:16,997
- Aren't you?
- What are these?

434
00:23:17,263 --> 00:23:19,241
These are pictures
of where you're from.

435
00:23:21,091 --> 00:23:22,991
I don't know where I'm from.

436
00:23:23,116 --> 00:23:24,216
Sure you do.

437
00:23:24,804 --> 00:23:26,737
I'll lay money on the fact
that you're a local.

438
00:23:26,862 --> 00:23:28,239
You have roots around here.

439
00:23:29,193 --> 00:23:31,376
You visited places like this
as a kid.

440
00:23:32,468 --> 00:23:35,154
One of these pictures here
will mean something to you.

441
00:23:36,278 --> 00:23:37,723
I get nothing from that.

442
00:23:37,848 --> 00:23:38,954
What about this?

443
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:42,503
Grace, a minute?

444
00:23:43,035 --> 00:23:44,422
Sure.
I'll be right back.

445
00:23:46,923 --> 00:23:47,925
This?

446
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:53,236
Just relax.
Don't work so hard.

447
00:23:53,963 --> 00:23:54,963
Look at that.

448
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:59,545
Have you ever seen a more beautiful,
more peaceful place?

449
00:24:01,415 --> 00:24:03,478
It would be cool
if I could just say the word,

450
00:24:03,603 --> 00:24:05,074
and you could be right there,

451
00:24:05,927 --> 00:24:07,640
listening to the birds sing...

452
00:24:09,408 --> 00:24:11,746
The wind rustling
through the trees...

453
00:24:13,062 --> 00:24:15,322
The water lapping against the shore.

454
00:24:17,772 --> 00:24:19,722
If I could just say the word.

455
00:24:26,884 --> 00:24:28,334
This couldn't wait?

456
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,001
This is so simple.

457
00:24:40,682 --> 00:24:41,842
I love you...

458
00:24:42,175 --> 00:24:44,621
More than this job,
more than anything.

459
00:24:45,932 --> 00:24:48,298
You got shot at today.
You're pumped full of adrenaline.

460
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:51,781
Yes, but that doesn't matter.

461
00:24:54,263 --> 00:24:55,708
I know what I want to do.

462
00:24:59,575 --> 00:25:02,083
I talked to a guy in
the San Francisco office today.

463
00:25:02,795 --> 00:25:04,765
There's an opening
in the major crimes unit.

464
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:06,723
It's only an hour and a half away.

465
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:10,919
- You mean it?
- Please, let's just do this.

466
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:13,092
I don't care where I work.

467
00:25:14,043 --> 00:25:15,191
I want you.

468
00:25:16,872 --> 00:25:18,057
You really mean it?

469
00:25:31,342 --> 00:25:32,342
Really?

470
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:33,698
Now?

471
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:36,121
Ranger Tisdale should be off
the mountain in an hour.

472
00:25:36,246 --> 00:25:39,231
His bank say he's depositing 2 grand
a month over and above his salary.

473
00:25:39,356 --> 00:25:41,180
- Cash.
- Let's go talk to him.

474
00:25:50,188 --> 00:25:51,188
Tisdale.

475
00:25:53,107 --> 00:25:54,719
I was gonna call you.
I just heard.

476
00:25:55,259 --> 00:25:56,259
Pot farm.

477
00:25:56,553 --> 00:25:57,889
Doesn't that beat everything?

478
00:25:58,057 --> 00:25:59,406
Right in your own woods.

479
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:02,719
I've been hiking these trails
for eight years. I had no idea.

480
00:26:02,844 --> 00:26:04,408
I don't know where you ended up,

481
00:26:04,533 --> 00:26:06,898
but you must've gotten
seriously turned around.

482
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,858
That's hard to believe

483
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:11,694
when the pot farmers are
paying you $2,000 a month.

484
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,614
- What you're talking about.
- Come with us.

485
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,420
Nice work.

486
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:31,299
Felt good.

487
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,685
<i>Send you to the farm?</i>

488
00:26:37,243 --> 00:26:39,340
<i>I was trying like hell
to keep you away from it.</i>

489
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:41,360
<i>All you had to do
was stay on the trail.</i>

490
00:26:41,485 --> 00:26:42,475
<i>Is that so hard?</i>

491
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:45,645
So you were taking money
to protect their farm?

492
00:26:47,008 --> 00:26:49,440
<i>They were paying me
to direct tourists away</i>

493
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,527
<i>and let'em know
if there were any local cops</i>

494
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:53,322
<i>or feds snooping around.</i>

495
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:56,532
<i>But that's it.
These people who got killed</i>

496
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:57,990
<i>I never even saw them.</i>

497
00:26:58,225 --> 00:26:59,951
The names of the people
who paid you.

498
00:27:01,991 --> 00:27:02,828
I can't.

499
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:05,623
These aren't hippies

500
00:27:06,305 --> 00:27:08,166
<i>growing weed in the forest, okay?</i>

501
00:27:08,291 --> 00:27:10,595
<i>These are serious, serious men.</i>

502
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,338
<i>If they learn that I do that,</i>

503
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:13,806
<i>they'll kill me.</i>

504
00:27:16,853 --> 00:27:18,561
<i>They know you've been arrested.</i>

505
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:21,146
They think you're giving them up.

506
00:27:21,434 --> 00:27:24,684
You're in danger.
With their names, we'll lock them up.

507
00:27:25,246 --> 00:27:26,246
I can't.

508
00:27:26,528 --> 00:27:27,778
It's your call.

509
00:27:28,959 --> 00:27:30,309
<i>You got a family?</i>

510
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:33,245
I suggest you send them somewhere.

511
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:35,945
Not out of town. Out of state.
Know anybody on the east coast?

512
00:27:37,535 --> 00:27:39,031
<i>Too bad.
How about overseas?</i>

513
00:27:39,313 --> 00:27:41,844
That's a first-rate interviewer
you got there.

514
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,291
What's up?

515
00:27:43,416 --> 00:27:45,958
Rigsby and Cho tell me
there was only one dude with a gun.

516
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:47,083
Not much.

517
00:27:48,141 --> 00:27:49,583
No, it's not.

518
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:52,063
So when you say,
"these are not hippies,

519
00:27:52,188 --> 00:27:54,255
"these are serious, serious men,"

520
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:57,717
that implies many scary men
with large guns, right?

521
00:27:58,377 --> 00:27:59,677
<i>So why just one?</i>

522
00:28:00,729 --> 00:28:02,963
<i>I don't know.
They might be low on money.</i>

523
00:28:03,088 --> 00:28:06,334
- <i>The crop is doing badly.</i>
- <i>Plants are dying?</i>

524
00:28:06,459 --> 00:28:08,438
<i>And the word is
that it's been going on</i>

525
00:28:08,563 --> 00:28:10,621
<i>for about 6 months,
and nobody can figure it out,</i>

526
00:28:10,746 --> 00:28:12,523
<i>they're really kind of freaking out.</i>

527
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,191
- I'm sure.
- Jane?

528
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:19,272
I think I gotta go.
I'll see you later. Thank you.

529
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:21,615
What'd you get from the guy?

530
00:28:22,032 --> 00:28:24,076
The pot farmers didn't kill Leonard.

531
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:25,077
That so?

532
00:28:26,285 --> 00:28:27,385
You certain?

533
00:28:27,704 --> 00:28:30,374
Certainty is the mother of fools.

534
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:34,670
So all this is just,
guesswork with you?

535
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:35,988
Pretty much. 

536
00:28:37,084 --> 00:28:38,810
That's what I do,

537
00:28:39,386 --> 00:28:40,386
I guess.

538
00:28:40,843 --> 00:28:42,762
For instance,
I guess that you're married.

539
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:45,399
- I'm wearing a ring.
- I guess that you're married,

540
00:28:45,721 --> 00:28:47,071
but not happily.

541
00:28:47,288 --> 00:28:49,954
Not that there's divorce proceedings

542
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:52,093
in place, but...

543
00:28:52,941 --> 00:28:54,523
Possibly a trial separation.

544
00:28:55,709 --> 00:28:57,863
Guess I should've put up a photo?

545
00:28:59,503 --> 00:29:01,920
I know you're not giving me
relationship advice,

546
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,586
so I have to wonder
why you would go there.

547
00:29:05,612 --> 00:29:08,454
I guess it's your way
of expressing unhappiness.

548
00:29:09,713 --> 00:29:10,539
Could be.

549
00:29:11,764 --> 00:29:15,753
It's your way of saying you're unhappy
with the way i'm handling Lisbon.

550
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,209
We spend a lot of time together.

551
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,605
And when she's unhappy,

552
00:29:21,074 --> 00:29:22,269
I'm less happy.

553
00:29:23,408 --> 00:29:24,595
It's human nature.

554
00:29:24,908 --> 00:29:25,908
Yes, it is.

555
00:29:27,229 --> 00:29:28,635
I'll tell you what, Patrick.

556
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:31,143
Why don't you let me handle
my business my way

557
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,728
and judge me by the results?

558
00:29:33,674 --> 00:29:35,561
And I'll let you handle yours
your way...

559
00:29:36,569 --> 00:29:37,650
Up to a point.

560
00:29:37,928 --> 00:29:39,159
That sounds fair.

561
00:29:39,686 --> 00:29:40,764
Up to a point.

562
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:43,891
Very fair.
We done?

563
00:29:45,785 --> 00:29:47,613
Please don't interrupt
interrogations.

564
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,954
- It's rude.
- That's a rule, is it?

565
00:29:50,767 --> 00:29:51,789
Guideline.

566
00:29:53,015 --> 00:29:54,208
I'll keep it in mind.

567
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,593
Now we're done.

568
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,203
Loving those pumps.

569
00:30:01,781 --> 00:30:02,550
Thanks.

570
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:15,275
What's this? Interesting.

571
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,722
We need to take amnesia girl up
to the reservation.

572
00:30:17,847 --> 00:30:20,858
- Meet me in the parking in 10 minutes.
- Why take her to the reservation?

573
00:30:20,983 --> 00:30:23,863
They're a memorial for Ailton.
She should be there.

574
00:30:24,288 --> 00:30:25,577
Worth a try, I guess.

575
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:29,076
Do me a favor. Don't mention this
to Lisbon or Hightower.

576
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,403
And why not?

577
00:30:31,176 --> 00:30:33,649
- Why complicate things?
- Complicate how?

578
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:38,410
You shouldn't have taken her out
of the hospital in the first place.

579
00:30:38,535 --> 00:30:40,879
Your car, parking lot, ten minutes.

580
00:30:49,705 --> 00:30:50,973
What you doing here?

581
00:30:51,545 --> 00:30:52,850
We're here to pay our

582
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:53,934
respects.

583
00:30:54,463 --> 00:30:55,936
It's okay.
We won't eat much.

584
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:56,937
Leonard

585
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,303
had only been with us a short while,

586
00:31:00,114 --> 00:31:01,567
but if you saw him,

587
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:05,029
walking a trail up at the lakes
or riding a horse,

588
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:06,989
you could see

589
00:31:07,328 --> 00:31:08,781
that he was home.

590
00:31:09,988 --> 00:31:11,702
So rember the old words.

591
00:31:12,343 --> 00:31:13,761
When a friend dies,

592
00:31:13,985 --> 00:31:15,247
we should not cry.

593
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,570
We should not hate someone

594
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:19,669
or fight.

595
00:31:20,418 --> 00:31:22,546
We should do right always.

596
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:26,563
And we should listen
to the old words

597
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:28,477
and remember Leonard.

598
00:31:30,793 --> 00:31:33,489
- If anyone else has something to say...
- I would.

599
00:31:36,084 --> 00:31:38,944
This woman was with Leonard
when he was shot. She has

600
00:31:39,459 --> 00:31:40,481
lost her memory.

601
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,100
So we...

602
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:44,777
brought her here today to see

603
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:45,974
if a face

604
00:31:46,338 --> 00:31:47,488
or a place or

605
00:31:47,932 --> 00:31:50,741
anything could help her
remember who she is.

606
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:53,906
This is kind of a sacred moment.
Is this really the time?

607
00:31:55,565 --> 00:31:56,994
It'll take but a second.

608
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:02,753
Anything?

609
00:32:06,676 --> 00:32:08,891
Never mind.
The trip was not entirely wasted.

610
00:32:09,114 --> 00:32:12,555
I was also looking at all of you to see
if anyone recognized her.

611
00:32:13,871 --> 00:32:14,765
And it seems

612
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,434
to me that somebody here
does know this woman.

613
00:32:18,664 --> 00:32:20,480
And that somebody is you, Sir.

614
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:22,559
Me?

615
00:32:23,811 --> 00:32:25,861
- I think you're mistaken.
- Prove it.

616
00:32:28,264 --> 00:32:29,029
How?

617
00:32:31,662 --> 00:32:33,261
Look into my eyes

618
00:32:33,859 --> 00:32:34,869
and hold this.

619
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:40,522
Now tell me you don't know her.

620
00:32:41,647 --> 00:32:43,627
I do not know this woman.

621
00:32:51,133 --> 00:32:53,721
It appears that I'm mistaken,
which is very good for you.

622
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:56,015
That eliminates you
from our inquiry.

623
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:58,434
My apologies. Carry on.
We'll just take

624
00:32:58,602 --> 00:32:59,874
our seats in the back.

625
00:32:59,999 --> 00:33:00,853
Thank you.

626
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,148
And, if you don't want us here,
then just say the word

627
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:06,483
and we'll go. Just say the word.

628
00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:08,865
- I think it would be better...
- I see it.

629
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,072
I see it!

630
00:33:22,924 --> 00:33:24,335
Now just relax,

631
00:33:24,706 --> 00:33:26,686
breathe and tell us what you see.

632
00:33:28,976 --> 00:33:30,476
There's a blue lake.

633
00:33:32,117 --> 00:33:33,167
Pine trees.

634
00:33:33,798 --> 00:33:34,848
A mountain.

635
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:37,706
There's a bird singing.

636
00:33:41,146 --> 00:33:42,436
Tell us what's happening

637
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:43,618
at this lake.

638
00:33:45,083 --> 00:33:47,524
- It's where the bad thing happened.
- What bad thing?

639
00:33:50,638 --> 00:33:51,845
Go look. They...

640
00:33:52,208 --> 00:33:54,388
They left something on the shore.

641
00:33:54,513 --> 00:33:56,720
- Who did?
- Go look. They left something.

642
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:58,771
They left something.

643
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,270
I'm sorry.

644
00:34:06,043 --> 00:34:07,193
Show is over.

645
00:34:07,808 --> 00:34:08,629
Come on.

646
00:34:08,961 --> 00:34:10,039
Watch your head.

647
00:34:10,491 --> 00:34:13,304
So Mr. Silverwing is gonna complain
to our superiors

648
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:15,085
in the strongest terms. Nice work.

649
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:17,863
See, that's why I didn't
bring you along, deniability.

650
00:34:17,988 --> 00:34:20,265
- How did you know we were here?
- I had little, tiny

651
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:22,601
GPS trackers sewn
into all your suits.

652
00:34:24,585 --> 00:34:26,563
For a second there,
I almost believed you.

653
00:34:28,922 --> 00:34:31,068
Sorry, Jane. I had to tell her.
It's my job.

654
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:32,361
That's not it.

655
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:34,605
- Get her back to the hospital.
- Yes, boss.

656
00:34:35,004 --> 00:34:37,074
- She did remember something.
- We have a clue.

657
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:39,435
A lake in the mountain,
something on the shore?

658
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,955
- Could be where the murders happened.
- There over 50 lakes in the mountains!

659
00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:44,498
I'll take her back.

660
00:34:44,831 --> 00:34:46,999
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
where I was going.

661
00:34:47,124 --> 00:34:48,919
I was trying to protect you.

662
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,255
I knew I was gonna stir things up.
With Hightower...

663
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,758
Don't ever try to protect me.
I can protect myself from

664
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,801
- Hightower or anybody else.
- Okay.

665
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,836
- Let's go back to the office.
- Or we could stay

666
00:34:59,961 --> 00:35:02,516
- and catch Railton's killer.
- How we gonna do that?

667
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,268
I need a cup.

668
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:07,688
Paper or plastic, I'd prefer paper.

669
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,652
So Jane Doe
didn't remember the lake?

670
00:35:14,255 --> 00:35:15,778
Posthypnotic suggestion.

671
00:35:15,903 --> 00:35:17,817
I showed her
a beautiful picture of a lake,

672
00:35:17,942 --> 00:35:20,782
told her that she would remember
it when she heard the trigger phrase

673
00:35:20,907 --> 00:35:23,009
"say the word."
She remembered the picture,

674
00:35:23,134 --> 00:35:26,623
associated it with the crime and felt
that something was left behind there.

675
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,858
- What something?
- It doesn't matter.

676
00:35:29,024 --> 00:35:31,879
The killer's feeling paranoid now,
so he or she will be compelled

677
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:33,828
to go back to the scene of the crime

678
00:35:33,953 --> 00:35:35,713
and make sure
that nothing was left behind.

679
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:38,017
That's assuming
the murder occurred at the lake.

680
00:35:38,142 --> 00:35:39,428
- It did.
- Because?

681
00:35:40,222 --> 00:35:41,502
Because...

682
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,891
the pot crop died, and Leonard Railton
was worried about the water

683
00:35:45,016 --> 00:35:46,560
his girlfriend's baby was getting.

684
00:35:47,018 --> 00:35:48,061
It's over here.

685
00:35:48,597 --> 00:35:51,343
And the water supply for around here
comes from the mountain lakes.

686
00:35:51,468 --> 00:35:53,806
Cho followed the killer
after the memorial.

687
00:35:53,931 --> 00:35:55,782
- And? Who is it?
- We'll see.

688
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:00,330
Where is he?

689
00:36:01,209 --> 00:36:03,059
Straight through the trees.

690
00:36:06,308 --> 00:36:07,308
Hands up.

691
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,375
- What?
- Hands up.

692
00:36:10,784 --> 00:36:12,275
I don't understand.

693
00:36:16,087 --> 00:36:17,341
What are you doing?

694
00:36:19,111 --> 00:36:20,135
Rifle shell.

695
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,048
Where'd you get that, Mr. Willis?

696
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,517
I just found it.

697
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:27,601
I was gonna give it to you. Do you think
it's connected to those murders?

698
00:36:28,751 --> 00:36:29,978
That's the best you got?

699
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:31,945
Why'd you shoot those four people?

700
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,078
I didn't.

701
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,912
Keep in mind that two of them...
The Langhams... they were...

702
00:36:36,037 --> 00:36:37,096
by-products,

703
00:36:37,221 --> 00:36:38,188
latecomers.

704
00:36:38,313 --> 00:36:39,352
But Leonard,

705
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:43,325
you killed because
of what's in the lake, didn't you?

706
00:36:45,463 --> 00:36:47,162
I don't know
what you're talking about.

707
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,361
Toxic waste.

708
00:36:49,167 --> 00:36:51,375
Great, big barrels of it, I expect.

709
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:54,920
Dumped by you. That's why the pot plants
in the valley were dying.

710
00:36:55,157 --> 00:36:58,053
That's why Derrien Hopwood's child
got a rash.

711
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,717
Leonard was gonna tell,

712
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:02,593
so you had to shoot him.

713
00:37:03,497 --> 00:37:04,804
Anyone else that just...

714
00:37:04,929 --> 00:37:06,974
happened to come along that day.

715
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,880
I don't even know what to say.

716
00:37:09,242 --> 00:37:10,561
That is not true.

717
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:13,980
This is ground zero for the dumping,
so the water here

718
00:37:14,246 --> 00:37:15,363
must be

719
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:18,103
much more toxic
than it is down in the valley.

720
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:20,663
- That is nonsense!
- Really?

721
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:22,891
Feeling a little parched?

722
00:37:23,086 --> 00:37:24,086
Have a drink.

723
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:28,328
- Why not?
- Come on. Cheers.

724
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,873
- Have a drink. Little sip.
- Please, stop.

725
00:37:32,226 --> 00:37:33,226
All right!

726
00:37:35,123 --> 00:37:37,275
I tried to get so many ideas

727
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,057
across the tribal council.

728
00:37:40,608 --> 00:37:42,409
But somebody didn't like it,

729
00:37:42,692 --> 00:37:45,596
or it wasn't culturally appropriate,
or blah, blah, blah.

730
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:48,098
So this guy said

731
00:37:48,856 --> 00:37:51,003
he needed to dump some stuff,

732
00:37:51,674 --> 00:37:54,663
and did I know any place on the rez
that he could do it?

733
00:37:55,951 --> 00:37:58,108
So I had Leonard take them up
to the lake.

734
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,487
I figured with his record,
he'd take the money

735
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,197
and keep his mouth shut.

736
00:38:04,975 --> 00:38:06,053
We went well.

737
00:38:07,908 --> 00:38:09,526
Got more trucks up there.

738
00:38:09,999 --> 00:38:11,330
Something was finally working

739
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:12,498
for me.

740
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:16,767
And then that kid in the valley
got a rash.

741
00:38:17,554 --> 00:38:19,004
And Leonard was worried.

742
00:38:19,129 --> 00:38:21,381
Said we were poisoning the valley,

743
00:38:21,793 --> 00:38:24,343
if we didn't stop,
that he was gonna blow the whistle.

744
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,826
Then I overheard him on the phone,

745
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:32,418
arranging to meet somebody
up at the lake.

746
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:36,710
So I went, too.

747
00:38:48,091 --> 00:38:49,785
When did the Langhams get there?

748
00:38:50,555 --> 00:38:52,037
I was cleaning up.

749
00:38:55,983 --> 00:38:57,918
What they doing there, anyway?

750
00:39:01,932 --> 00:39:03,519
They were taking a hike?

751
00:39:09,075 --> 00:39:10,156
I'm sorry.

752
00:39:12,709 --> 00:39:13,709
I am.

753
00:39:15,398 --> 00:39:16,561
I'm sorry.

754
00:39:18,909 --> 00:39:20,390
That's okay, then.

755
00:39:21,341 --> 00:39:22,906
As long as you're sorry.

756
00:39:23,183 --> 00:39:24,486
Maybe we'll just let you go.

757
00:39:29,965 --> 00:39:31,000
I'm kidding.

758
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,697
Got something for you.

759
00:39:42,499 --> 00:39:43,961
Your driver's license.

760
00:39:44,623 --> 00:39:46,240
We got it from Markham Willis.

761
00:39:48,668 --> 00:39:51,513
Your name is Camille Dillon.
You live in Oakland.

762
00:39:52,155 --> 00:39:53,932
You're an internet journalist
and writer.

763
00:39:54,365 --> 00:39:55,970
We contacted your family.

764
00:39:56,525 --> 00:39:58,341
Your mom is on her way
from Des Moines.

765
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:02,566
My name is Camille?

766
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:04,520
Apparently,
you taught Leonard Railton

767
00:40:04,645 --> 00:40:06,724
while he was in the juvenile system.

768
00:40:07,162 --> 00:40:08,110
A while ago,

769
00:40:08,235 --> 00:40:09,865
- he got in touch with you...
- Wait.

770
00:40:12,069 --> 00:40:13,098
Something...

771
00:40:13,736 --> 00:40:15,132
Something was wrong.

772
00:40:16,367 --> 00:40:17,403
They were...

773
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:19,673
Someone was... dumping...

774
00:40:21,418 --> 00:40:22,419
Toxins.

775
00:40:23,641 --> 00:40:24,641
And he...

776
00:40:24,936 --> 00:40:26,802
He wanted people to know. He...

777
00:40:28,771 --> 00:40:29,808
He called...

778
00:40:30,081 --> 00:40:31,375
And he... he asked

779
00:40:31,945 --> 00:40:33,402
for my help. I rem...

780
00:40:34,381 --> 00:40:35,721
I remember him.

781
00:40:38,538 --> 00:40:40,536
I remember him asking for my help.

782
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,273
I remember.

783
00:40:45,175 --> 00:40:46,319
I remember me.

784
00:40:49,404 --> 00:40:50,930
I know who I am.

785
00:41:01,205 --> 00:41:03,935
Just let me finish this up,
and we'll go talk to Hightower.

786
00:41:08,182 --> 00:41:09,230
What's up?

787
00:41:11,691 --> 00:41:13,321
I love you. I do.

788
00:41:16,033 --> 00:41:17,724
But I think I love the job more.

789
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,684
Job's not a problem. I'm gonna go.

790
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:22,201
You'd be leaving the unit...

791
00:41:22,412 --> 00:41:23,412
For us.

792
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:24,606
So?

793
00:41:26,085 --> 00:41:28,033
I don't want that responsibility.

794
00:41:29,049 --> 00:41:30,376
You'll hate me for it.

795
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:32,461
Maybe not today, but someday
you will.

796
00:41:33,403 --> 00:41:34,616
I'm so sorry.

797
00:41:41,318 --> 00:41:42,349
You're...

798
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:44,000
certain about this?

799
00:41:46,547 --> 00:41:47,939
I know who I am.

800
00:42:01,054 --> 00:42:04,004
Narcotics picked up the pot farmers
off the ranger's confession.

801
00:42:04,129 --> 00:42:06,138
I also got a call
from a guy named Silverwing

802
00:42:06,263 --> 00:42:08,665
about a stunt you pulled up
on the storm river reservation.

803
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:11,085
- I wouldn't call that a stunt...
- He was displeased.

804
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:14,130
Yes, ma'am. I filled out a P-90...
You solved the triple, right?

805
00:42:14,724 --> 00:42:15,753
Nobody got hurt?

806
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:18,887
Then the hell with him.
You got justice done.

807
00:42:20,956 --> 00:42:22,414
Keep up the good work.

808
00:42:29,402 --> 00:42:30,789
That was unexpected.

809
00:42:30,914 --> 00:42:31,914
I'll say.

810
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:42,142
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

811
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:43,310
But...

812
00:42:45,973 --> 00:42:46,973
I just...

813
00:42:49,598 --> 00:42:51,106
I just... forgot my...

814
00:42:51,415 --> 00:42:52,277
stuff.
