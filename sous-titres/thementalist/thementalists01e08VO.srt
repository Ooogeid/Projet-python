Someone who uses mental acuity,hypnosis and/or suggestion.

A master manipulator of thoughts and behavior.

4
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,049
You're here. Thank god.

5
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,279
There was screaming

6
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,010
And gunshots upstairs in room 222.

7
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,510
The one-- the one on the right.

8
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,140
Right there.

9
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,420
Police! Open the door.

10
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,930
Come on, open up!

11
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,670
Glad you could make it.

12
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,509
We have a young female--

13
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:45,089
Patrice matigan and joseph purcell,

14
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,399
Who was gonna be the star witness

15
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,949
In california vs. Carris, which was one

16
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,489
Of the attorney general's

17
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,350
Favorite upcoming narcotics cases.

18
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,819
State's witness, and no police protection?

19
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,249
Uh-huh. Davis p.D. Had it covered--

20
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,209
That is, until purcell went a.W.O.L. A few weeks ago.

21
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:04,340
Didn't want to testify, I guess.

22
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,580
With purcell dead, the case against carris dies, too.

23
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:12,169
He walks. So obviously, guys, for all of our sakes,

24
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,020
This is a must-close.

25
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,819
Davis p.D. Is still running the carris case, by the way,

26
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,329
So we have to work with them. Don't freeze 'em

27
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,149
Out. Who is carris, and where is he or she right now

28
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,809
Rick carris is the man to know in the davis meth business.

29
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:30,549
He was busted a month ago after a big, expensive operation.

30
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,020
He's out and about on a $2 million bond.

31
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,720
Purcell here is one of his top street captains.

32
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,760
Look at that.

33
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,359
This fool is state's witness against the biggest

34
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,829
Cocaine dealer in the county, and he's dealing the same drug

35
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:50,189
Out of his own motel room--like carris wouldn't hear about that.

36
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,100
He must have had a death wish.

37
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,620
Looks like a couple of ounces.

38
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,320
It's not cocaine.

39
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,150
It's powdered milk.

40
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:03,759
Yes, that's often used to cut the product.

41
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,030
Jane?

42
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,099
What are you looking for?

43
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,919
The girl had her keys in her hand.

44
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,390
She was only planning on stopping by.

45
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,510
Hello.

46
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,369
So what happens to her?

47
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,539
Social services have foster homes that specialize in babies.

48
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,469
They'll take care of her until we can find patrice's family.

49
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,919
If she has a family.

50
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,530
Yeah. Social services. This is kaylee?

51
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,359
Lisbon, jane, van pelt,

52
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,479
Detectives blakely and preciado, davis homicide.

53
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,449
They will be your liaisons with davis p.D.

54
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:23,819
I speak for myself and your chief

55
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,090
When I urge you all to work harmoniously.

56
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,080
That means play nice.

57
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,820
Keep me posted.

58
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,069
Hi. So your name's blakely?

59
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,559
Mm-hmm. The first responder was a blakely.

60
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,289
That was my son. Poor kid--first time rolling up on a body.

61
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:45,659
Puked his guts up later. He'll be okay. Listen, uh, just so we're clear,

62
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,449
Now you can call us "liaisons" if you like,

63
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:51,169
But this is still a davis p.D. Case.

64
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:54,479
Our narcotics unit's been trying to bust rick carris for years.

65
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,789
We appreciate your position.

66
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,409
Have you checked the liquor store over there

67
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:00,819
For surveillance cameras? Not yet.

68
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,169
We're still questioning the guests

69
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,219
I'll get on it. I got a dumb question.

70
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,629
How come you guys let joe purcell slip away?

71
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,039
Stuff happens, right?

72
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,989
Yeah. Stuff happens.

73
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,779
Yeah. When we bring in rick carris,

74
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:15,229
We'll give you a call. You're confident it was carris who did this?

75
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,939
Purcell seems like the type of man

76
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:20,950
Who had quite a few enemies. Yeah, we're confident.

77
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,519
What if purcell wasn't the target?

78
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,189
What if the girl was the target? What makes you think that?

79
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,229
What makes you think she wasn't? Either way,

80
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,399
She's the place to start with the investigation

81
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,029
She was only here for a moment,

82
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,359
So the shooter came in as soon as she arrived,

83
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,459
Which suggests that he or they followed her here.

84
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,329
So we'll retrace her steps.

85
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,949
What's patrice matigan's current address?

86
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:43,769
We don't know. We checked the address on her licens

87
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:46,229
And registration, but she hasn't lived her for several months.

88
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,569
You're making this more difficult than it needs to be.

89
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:51,309
We know whodunit. This was a hit ordered by rick carris.

90
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,109
If he's in town, we'll round him up.

91
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,849
You guys relax, see the sights.

92
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,760
We'll call you when there's any news.

93
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:02,139
When are you gonna learn to cool it without being told?

94
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:06,360
Oh, come on. They pissed you off, too, the sexist pigs. They were.

95
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,609
I just said they were.

96
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,660
You were saying it ironically.

97
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,870
Here. There was a couple of issues of that in her car.

98
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,899
"fifty fresh and floral ideas for a spring wedding"?

99
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,730
Where did Patrice Matigan have this?

100
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,389
Mailing address.

101
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:27,630
"lacey wells. 65758 rancho highway."

102
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,520
Let's go.

103
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,300
Lacey wells?

104
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:40,799
You the cops?

105
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,420
Yeah, cbi.

106
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,160
What's the problem? Do you know patrice matigan?

107
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,980
She lives here.

108
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,169
What about her? And where is she?

109
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,430
She was murdered early this morning.

110
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,130
Oh, my god.

111
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,760
How long have you known patrice?

112
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:04,390
Couple of years, like that.

113
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,069
And she's lived here with you for how long?

114
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,800
Since joe got busted.

115
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,730
Two, three months.

116
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,200
She couldn't stay with him, the way he lives.

117
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,740
That son of a bitch!

118
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,409
Now I knew he'd get her into trouble.

119
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:19,929
Can you think of anybody who would have wanted to

120
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:23,740
Kill him? Aside from rick carris and any of his crew

121
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:27,060
Sure, lots of people.

122
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,079
Can you tell us what happened last night?

123
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,209
Joe called her really late.

124
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:35,720
He's mad hungry, but he's paranoid.

125
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,029
Won't leave his room.

126
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,569
Thinks rick carris' boys are everywhere.

127
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:42,799
Begs her to bring him some food,

128
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,740
Which she does...

129
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,510
Like a fool.

130
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,520
And that's...

131
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,250
That's the last I saw of her and kaylee.

132
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,049
Why would she take kaylee out with her

133
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,570
In the middle of the night?

134
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,460
Couldn't you have babysat for her?

135
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,450
I had been drinking.

136
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,920
And she didn't want to leave kaylee with me.

137
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,610
She had her flaws,

138
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,589
But she was a good mom.

139
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:14,629
I mean, that kid is always clean

140
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:17,810
And--and dry, and she's smiling.

141
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:21,129
Look at how she keeps this place.

142
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:24,219
Yeah. It's nice. How does she pay the rent?

143
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,770
Oh, she always has money when she needs it.

144
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,379
You know, her and me got busted this last christmas,

145
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:32,069
And she came up with, like, 10 grand to front the bail

146
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,059
And even more for the lawyer.

147
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:37,239
I mean, we were busted with a whole ounce of meth,

148
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,639
And she made that crap disappear. She was into meth?

149
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,920
No. No.

150
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:44,780
No, it was my drugs.

151
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:49,640
But it was in her car, so you know...

152
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,790
Did you ask her how she got the money to pay for the lawyer?

153
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,839
She wasn't the hooker type,

154
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,509
So I just figured she had a rich boyfriend hidden somewhere.

155
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,739
You know, a couple of times, a dude would come by

156
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:04,179
And not come in. You know, she'd go for a ride,

157
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:07,649
And then she had cash when she came back.

158
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,029
What did he look like?

159
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:12,569
He's, um, like a skinny, tough guy,

160
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:15,550
Dark hair and drove a blue car.

161
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,630
Excuse me.

162
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,990
It always goes off.

163
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:21,989
Lisbon.

164
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,069
Just got a call from sacramento homicide.

165
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,909
Snitch gave 'em a location on rick carris.

166
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,509
He's in boonville, halfway between here and davis.

167
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,289
Get an entry team. We're on our way.

168
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:31,729
Should I tell blakely and preciado?

169
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:34,319
Of course. Davis p.D. Are our partners in this

170
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,810
Hold off on going in until I get there.

171
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,040
Thank you, lacey.

172
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,849
Yeah, hey, uh, listen, social services--

173
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,289
They're--they're not gonna bring kaylee back here, are they?

174
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:49,479
No. I-i love her and all,

175
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,849
But I'm not-- i-i couldn't...

176
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:54,629
Don't worry. They're not gonna bring her back here, okay?

177
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,719
She's goes somewhere okay, though, right?

178
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,499
I mean, they'll-- they'll take care of her good?

179
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,939
Yes. They try.

180
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,590
She's a good kid, so...

181
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,889
Hey. Where you going? To make the bust. What do you think? Cover the back.

182
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:17,999
Wait. What? Oh, you guys wanna help

183
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,629
Or you gonna stand there and pick your nose?

184
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,909
Come on, guys. Play nice. This is a joint operation

185
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,299
We go in together when our boss and the entry

186
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,179
Team get here. Unh-unh-unh. This is our arrest

187
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,429
Always has been, and we got no time to wait for your mommy.

188
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,469
Hey, there's always time, all right? Let 's do this right.

189
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,139
Go in too quickly, and someone will get hurt.

190
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:35,340
This is real police work, sonny. People get hurt

191
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,039
Go push some paper. Real police work?

192
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,140
You mean like protecting a state's witness

193
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,739
Rigsby, hey, hey. Walk away. Walk away.

194
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,459
Look at me. All right? We told 'em not to go in.

195
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,889
If this goes south now, it's their necks.

196
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,550
We don't want to be involved in any way. Be smart. Let it go.

197
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,409
What's going on? What are they doing?

198
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,309
Blakely and preciado wouldn't wait for the entry team

199
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,990
Tried to talk to them. They wouldn't listen. They're out for blood.

200
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,649
Don't move, cops.

201
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,430
Get on your knees right now. Let's see your hands.

202
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:48,500
That's our bust. Hand him over.

203
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:52,010
The hell we will. Walk away.

204
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,930
Hey, calm down.

205
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,309
Yes, we get it.

206
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:10,319
You're very calm and in control, rick...

207
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,969
For a man being questioned in a double murder investigation.

208
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:15,750
I didn't do this thing.

209
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,729
Although, I've been sat in this frickin' chair so many times,

210
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,379
This is kind of restful.

211
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,770
That's right, isn't it? Many times.

212
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,910
"assault...

213
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:27,279
Possession, intent to distribute."

214
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,609
This trafficking case coming up--that's three now for you.

215
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,259
You get nailed, you're in for life.

216
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:35,389
That's a long time. All on the testimony of joe purcell.

217
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,259
Look, it's no secret joe purcell's death

218
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,990
Was a huge boon for me, man. Come on, it was huge.

219
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:42,969
And I gotta confess, I was...

220
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,009
Really starting to feel that life sentence

221
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:47,230
Breathe down my neck, but you know what?

222
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,549
I got angels, man. I got fierce angels on my shoulders.

223
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,430
Are you a man of your word, rick?

224
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:56,250
I am. You do what you say you'll do?

225
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:58,089
Look, I know where this is going.

226
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:00,060
This is from purcell's answering machine

227
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,370
Hey, joe. You're a dead man. Dead.

228
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:06,179
I'm gonna do you my own self. I'm gonna look you in the eye

229
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,979
And cut your heart out and shove it down your throat,

230
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,420
You mo-- that is you, isn't it?

231
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:13,109
Hyperbole is lost on some people.

232
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:15,069
We think you kept your word, rick. You found patrice.

233
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,919
You followed her to joe purcell hiding at the motel.

234
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,450
You killed him and that young girl just to stay out of prison,

235
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,229
Just like you said you would. No,

236
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:25,679
I said I was gonna cut his heart out and feed it to him

237
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,319
Poetic license. Nuh-unh. No, if I had found him, I'd have kept my word.

238
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,709
Believe me, and I was looking for him.

239
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,349
That's how you know it wasn't me, man.

240
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,519
All right, maybe I wouldn't have cut his heart out or nothing,

241
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,929
But I definitely would have cut him.

242
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:39,399
I mean, I've got a reputation to consider. Where were you last night?

243
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,600
A bar I own, del's tavern. Until when?

244
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:45,179
I don't know. 11:30, maybe.

245
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,419
Anyone with you?

246
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,239
Oh, yeah. Sasha.

247
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,180
Sasha. Sasha have a second name?

248
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,929
Sasha the cocktail waitress.

249
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:57,829
One young lady in your employ. That's not much of an alibi.

250
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,509
It's not much of a case, man.

251
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:02,509
You got no murder weapon and you got no witnesses.

252
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:06,449
So you can kiss my ass, unless you want to get a sun lamp

253
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:09,269
In here and a couple of beers. I'll be happy to kick back

254
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:12,169
And listen to you guys waste your frickin' time.

255
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:14,589
I guess I'll just hand you over to the davis p.D.

256
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:17,270
They're very anxious to talk to you.

257
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:19,759
All right.

258
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,109
Whatever. Look, I want to talk to my lawyer now, please.

259
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:24,740
Okay. So we're done here.

260
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,380
Food's here.

261
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:32,950
Hawaiian?

262
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,839
Cho hates pineapple.

263
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,869
Well, he can take it off, can't he?

264
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,210
Yeah, I guess.

265
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:42,229
I don't complain when he and rigsby order mexican.

266
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:46,530
What is it you don't like about mexican? Cilantro. I can't stand it.

267
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,169
But I don't make a fuss.

268
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:50,340
Oh, you don't, do you? Why is that?

269
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,640
Sometimes you have to go along to get along.

270
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,679
Well, it's nice to be nice,

271
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,719
But if you want to get ahead in life,

272
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,239
Sometimes you have to be a bitch. I know you know how. Gee, thanks.

273
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,859
It's all about the balance, grace. Yin--yang.

274
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,929
Nice--bitch.

275
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:09,769
A little bit of bitch inside the nice,

276
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:12,719
A little bit of nice inside the bitch. Yeah, I'll work on that.

277
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,130
Keep 'em guessing.

278
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:21,100
There's pineapple on it.

279
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,819
You can take it off.

280
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,410
I'll know it's been there.

281
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,899
So carris was at del's tavern.

282
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,969
Sasha the cocktail waitress says she was with him

283
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,119
At his residence at 12:45 a.M.

284
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,979
When the motel shootings took place. She's confident about the time frame

285
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,270
Because they were having sex with the tv on.

286
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:39,109
And it was the scottish guy talking to that actress

287
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,199
Who married the country singer. Carris would have got someone else

288
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,829
To do the dirty work for him anyway. He was only boasting

289
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,069
When he said about how he's gonna rip out

290
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,309
Purcell's heart himself.

291
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:50,389
He's a drug dealer, not an aztec. That's good. Not an aztec

292
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:53,129
You're right. Carris isn't responsible for these murders.

293
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:55,479
Why not? He told you himself-- it's not his style.

294
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,069
He wouldn't have had the patience to watch

295
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:59,639
And follow patrice until she led him to purcell.

296
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,249
And if he had found her, he would have just jumped right in

297
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,099
And hurt her until she gave purcell up.

298
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,299
Just for the sake of argument, let's assume you're right

299
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,329
Yes, I'm saying that maybe patrice matigan was

300
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:10,009
The target. That's the second time you said that

301
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:10,599
Well, patrice--

302
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,279
She was an attractive young woman, but didn't work

303
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,659
And had a regular supply of money from somewhere...

304
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:22,119
Boyfriend. And was able to make a very serious drug charge disappear.

305
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,519
Cop boyfriend. Skinny cop boyfriend with dark hair that drives a blue car,

306
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,119
If you listen to lacey wells.

307
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,610
Detective preciado is skinny with dark hair.

308
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,879
He had crossed my mind.

309
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,739
And a hot-tempered man, as we now know,

310
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,399
Who probably carries what, a .38?

311
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,159
Yeah. Yeah, I think he does. Yeah.

312
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,799
Joe and patrice were shot with a .38. Yes, they were.

313
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,699
Slow down. What's his motive? Well,

314
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,179
It's a simple crime of passion, isn't it

315
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,949
He comes upon the woman he loves with another man.

316
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:49,259
Kills them both. Oh, damn. He couldn't have been that surprised.

317
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:53,109
She had joe purcell's baby. How is she? The baby.

318
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:56,189
Uh, fine, I guess. I mean, she's a baby.

319
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:59,969
Keep 'em warm and fed, they're happy. Let's go have a chat with preciado.

320
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:03,229
We're already in hot water with the davis p.D.

321
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,229
We need to be sure we're right,

322
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:08,549
Find out the facts and then act. Yes, boss.

323
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:11,359
Let's see if patrice really did dodge a possession charge

324
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,919
At christmas and let's make sure

325
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,669
The story about the accident money is bogus.

326
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,039
Then we'll go to the friend, lacey,

327
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,499
And we'll show her pictures.

328
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,609
If she i.D.S preciado as the man she saw,

329
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:25,979
And if preciado drives a blue car and if he carries a .38,

330
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:30,100
We'll go, and we'll talk to him. Preciado owns a blue car.

331
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,070
May I have your salad?

332
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:54,690
Oh, gladys knight and the pips.

333
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,919
You brought our prisoner back?

334
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,139
Detective preciado, we need to sit down with you for a while.

335
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:03,309
We have a few questions for you. What questions?

336
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,240
That's a .38 you carry, isn't it?

337
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:10,559
You trying to say it was me? You miserable sons of bitches.

338
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,919
Where the hell do you get the nerve--

339
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,019
Hold on, steve. Cool it. Let me handle this

340
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,339
No. No, this one's mine. Where the hell do you get the nerve

341
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,139
To come up here in my town, talking to me like that?

342
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:21,719
What weapon do I carry? Kiss my ass.

343
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,150
The california state constitution.

344
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,329
We've come to you out here out of respect.

345
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:27,929
We could have found you in the police station

346
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:29,759
And made a fuss. You should be glad you didn't.

347
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,500
No, you should be glad we didn't.

348
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:35,399
You have nothing on me.

349
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,119
We can put you with patrice.

350
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,779
Her roommate, lacey wells, i.D.

351
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,839
'd you from a photo. Come have a quiet talk with us

352
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,019
Clear up a couple of things, no big deal. What couple of things?

353
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,819
This doesn't concern you, detective. Excuse me. He's my partner.

354
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,849
Leave it alone, dale. Just leave it.

355
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:52,140
I can handle this. Let's go.

356
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,060
Good--good to meet you again.

357
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:09,939
What's the matter with him?

358
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,939
How well did you know patrice matigan? Let's not screw around here.

359
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,469
Just tell me what you have, cop to cop.

360
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:18,399
Cop to cop? We know you were giving her money.

361
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,029
We know she got off of a meth bust last christmas.

362
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:24,159
Evidence was lost, right? From the davis p.D. Lockup?

363
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,069
Happens.

364
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,670
We figure you took it.

365
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,539
That's what you figure. Yes,

366
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,809
And we could dig in and prove it, but I don't wan

367
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:31,829
To spend any time doing that.

368
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,729
I'd rather just talk straight with you,

369
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:38,509
Avoid dragging other good cops into this mess, right? Go on.

370
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,910
We figure you and patrice were having a sexual relationship.

371
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,880
She was...

372
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:50,369
She was a confidential informant.

373
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:53,320
We considered that, but then she'd be on file, right?

374
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,089
And you would have put in for the money as a c.I. Expense,

375
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,330
But you didn't do that, did you?

376
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:01,449
Why? My guess-- because you're an honest man.

377
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,180
Yeah. Sure. Okay.

378
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,340
I was banging her. So what?

379
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:09,709
Did you know she was also in a relationship

380
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:10,839
With your missing witness?

381
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:14,029
We had a business relationship. I paid her for sex

382
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:16,649
I didn't know or care what she did when I wasn't there.

383
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,330
You paid her a lot of money. A lot.

384
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,619
Good-looking man like you,

385
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,830
There had to have been more to it than that.

386
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,809
Did she have something on you? Well,

387
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:26,529
She was punctual and clean and didn't say much

388
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:29,629
I like that in a woman. Did you know your man joe purcell was

389
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,969
The father of her child? No.

390
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:35,080
A lowlife junkie dealer with your woman--

391
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,879
How'd that make you feel?

392
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,650
Couldn't care less.

393
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,780
Do you, uh, want the rest of my sandwich?

394
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,339
I can't finish it. What?

395
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,669
It's good sandwich. Try it.

396
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:48,950
Good sandwich.

397
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,469
What is wrong with him?

398
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:55,890
Where were you at 12:45 a.M. Monday morning?

399
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,180
I was at my partner's.

400
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:01,179
We watched the game. I was too drunk to drive,

401
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,379
So I slept on the couch.

402
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:06,509
At blakely's? Just you and him? And his wife.

403
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,210
Do you have your weapon on you?

404
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,270
Yes, I do.

405
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:13,779
Mind if we borrow it for a while,

406
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,970
Have ballistics take a look at it?

407
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:19,509
Look, I don't want to have to make this official,

408
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,649
Talk to a judge or anything.

409
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:23,670
Once we do that, the cat's out of the bag for good.

410
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:27,680
If you're clean on this, here's the way to prove it.

411
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,329
Is this the only .38 in your possession?

412
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:38,229
Yes, it is. And if you try to hold my hand again,

413
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,239
I'm gonna tear your arm off

414
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,729
And beat you unconscious with it. Get me?

415
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:43,930
Gotcha.

416
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,529
Well? You know, it's just funny what bad liars cops are.

417
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:49,529
I guess they're not used to

418
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,409
Concealing themselves under questioning.

419
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,159
I'm a cop, and I lie to you all the time. You never catch it.

420
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,439
Well, sorry to burst your bubble,

421
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,389
But you're translucent, my dear. I always know when you're lying.

422
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,029
Sometimes I let you think you fooled me

423
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:03,809
Just so you don't feel bad. Name one time.

424
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:06,299
Mm. Last thanksgiving you said you were going back east

425
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,909
To your brother's house, but I knew you were actually planning

426
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,189
On having three days at home alone

427
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:15,030
To watch old movies and eat ice cream. Okay, so that's one time.

428
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,049
What about preciado?

429
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:23,799
His stress pulse rate was thready, dishonest.

430
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,030
Thready?

431
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,599
Hard to describe pulses.

432
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,679
Uh, a dishonest pulse feels different to an indignant pulse.

433
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,469
In this case, hard to say what he's lying about exactly,

434
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:35,549
But he was signaling deception from first to last.

435
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,939
There's something off about his whole story.

436
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,409
Where are we going? To the zoo. They have new tiger cubs

437
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:41,559
Oh. Liar.

438
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,269
Oh, very good. I'm gonna go and speak with blakely.

439
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:47,129
Blakely's not gonna tell you anything. Nah, blakely's old-school.

440
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:48,329
He'll back his partner to the moon,

441
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:50,569
But his wife might be less steadfast.

442
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,259
I'll keep the husband in the office while you go

443
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:56,000
And talk to the wife. Ah. Sweet.

444
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,719
What is it?

445
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,749
Patrick jane, cbi. Yeah, uh, what is it?

446
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:19,010
I'd like to speak with katherine blakely.

447
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:21,619
Sam? Officer sam blakely?

448
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:24,219
Yeah. Uh, now isn't very convenient.

449
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,259
Uh, if you want to speak with her,

450
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,569
You should call and arrange something. Yes,

451
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:29,799
I was just passing by. That's a shame, sam

452
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,910
I really did need to speak to her. Who is it, sam?

453
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,189
Cbi, ma'am. Murder investigation.

454
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:39,350
Murder investigation? The purcell-matigan killings?

455
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,639
The couple I found.

456
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,129
Oh, my lord. Yes.

457
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:45,750
Terrible thing. That poor little baby.

458
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,679
Well, I'll--i'll leave you to it then.

459
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:51,320
No, ma'am. It's... You that I wish to speak with.

460
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:56,490
I am so proud of my two policemen.

461
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,099
There are three generations

462
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:01,229
Of davis law enforcement in this family. Three.

463
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:04,309
When people see the blakely name in davis,

464
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,229
They know that it stands for something.

465
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,549
Cripe sakes, ma. It's enough.

466
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:10,330
Oh, he hates me bragging on him.

467
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,909
So tell me, why on earth do you want to ask me

468
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,600
About these killings?

469
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,630
Officer blakely, could we have a moment alone, please?

470
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,550
It's okay.

471
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,230
It's kind of confidential stuff, ma'am.

472
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,520
Well, go on, sam.

473
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:31,449
I don't think I should, mom. Dad wouldn't like it.

474
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:33,299
Well, you're not your dad.

475
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,310
Just give us a moment.

476
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:37,400
Go on.

477
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,709
Sam was so upset that night.

478
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:59,720
It was his first time coming up on a killing. Poor thing.

479
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,359
I remember the first time dale caught a bad call.

480
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,569
We were newlyweds, and he came home and he actually cried.

481
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:09,090
Tried to hide it.

482
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,679
But I told him and I told sam

483
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,509
That there is no shame in feeling sad.

484
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:15,890
There isn't.

485
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,380
You've experienced the same thing, no doubt.

486
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,510
Death is part of the job.

487
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,479
Yes. Yes, it is.

488
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,270
Sorry. Rambling.

489
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:29,679
What did you wanna talk to me about, mr. Jane?

490
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,339
Ma'am, your husband's partner, detective preciado,

491
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,219
Is a person of interest in the case.

492
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,880
Steve? No.

493
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,159
He said that he was here at your house,

494
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,779
Sleeping on your couch, at the time of the murders.

495
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,419
That was 12:45 a.M. Monday morning.

496
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,539
Was he here?

497
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:48,999
Yes. Yes, he was. He--he stayed the night.

498
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,949
Why would you be interested in steve?

499
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:53,470
He's such a straight arrow.

500
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:56,729
He said that he was having an affair

501
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:58,510
With patrice matigan.

502
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:02,059
Steve preciado?

503
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,610
Yes. Why not?

504
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,699
Uh, I don't know.

505
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,100
It--it--it just doesn't seem likely.

506
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,350
Katherine, you're hiding something.

507
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,929
This is a state investigation.

508
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:18,040
You're obligated to tell me the truth.

509
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,709
Well, you have to promise

510
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:24,260
That you will not say it was me who spoke of it. I won't tell a soul.

511
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:28,019
Well, dale says that steve has a problem,

512
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,370
You know...

513
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,020
Down there?

514
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,040
Down there.

515
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:37,049
There's pills for that now.

516
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:38,390
Yes.

517
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:42,300
No. He's a hopeless case, apparently.

518
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:45,510
Well, that's strange.

519
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,649
That's very strange, 'cause he's the one that told us

520
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,749
He was having an affair with patrice.

521
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,269
Oh, well, knowing steve,

522
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:54,979
I'm sure he was lying to protect his machismo

523
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,220
Or protecting someone else.

524
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,599
Oh. I-i'm so sorry. How stupid of me.

525
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,039
No, it's--it's... What happened?

526
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,849
Nothing. It--it's just a little accident.

527
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:14,009
What did you say to her, huh? What do you--what have you done?

528
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:16,019
He's done nothing. Your father...

529
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,800
My father? What? What did you tell her?

530
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:21,710
You knew.

531
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:24,380
You knew that's who she was.

532
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,859
That's why the two of you have been whispering in corners

533
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,660
And acting so strange.

534
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:32,020
No, ma. You got it all wrong.

535
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:34,270
You don't understand.

536
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,630
Dad wasn't having an affair.

537
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,339
Dad, mom thinks that-- what, sam? What do I think?

538
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,829
You swore on his life.

539
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,549
You swore on your son's life you would

540
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,439
Never betray me again! Come inside, hon

541
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,719
I'm gonna tell you the truth, just not out here. Oh, no. Not out here.

542
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,439
You're dale blakely. You're one of the good guys. Get in the house now!

543
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,049
Detective blakely... Uhh!

544
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:08,139
Ooh! Shut your mouth.

545
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,779
You okay? Assault. Assault.

546
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:12,110
I would rethink this new technique of yours.

547
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can't disagree.

548
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:35,080
Now we're arresting them.

549
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:37,709
Hooray. We have the right. He assaulted jane,

550
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,169
And he looks good for the murders.

551
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:41,289
Before you charge a cop with murder, you better loo

552
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:43,969
Better than good. You better look like the damn mona lisa. Yes, I hear--

553
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:47,119
Because if you're wrong, we will have no murder suspect,

554
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,029
The attorney general

555
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:50,139
Will have no narcotics case against carris,

556
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,759
And we will have wrongly arrested

557
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,120
A distinguished veteran officer in his home jurisdiction.

558
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,730
Yes, boss.

559
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,029
What was the nature

560
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:01,160
Of your relationship with patrice matigan?

561
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:04,379
I was helping her out. Helping her with close to 1,000 bucks a month.

562
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,790
That's a lot of help.

563
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,210
What did she give you in return? Nothing.

564
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:13,080
Okay. What story did you tell your wife about the money?

565
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:17,919
I... Got nothing left to say. How were you making ends meet?

566
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,330
Did you maybe take a little drug money now and again?

567
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:24,429
I never took a penny. Not a damn penny.

568
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,529
So I guess if patrice started asking you for more money,

569
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:29,020
You'd have been hard-pressed, right? Get me a lawyer.

570
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,490
I'll set that up for you.

571
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:35,549
Oh. Where's your service revolver?

572
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:38,679
Agent rigsby tells me you didn't have it with you. It was stolen.

573
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,729
Yeah? Yeah, from my car.

574
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:44,170
Okay. It's no problem. It happens.

575
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,469
A .38, was it?

576
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:46,790
That's right.

577
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,240
I'll get you that lawyer.

578
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,650
He's not gonna talk.

579
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:58,399
Poor soul. He made his bed. He can lie in it.

580
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,079
You know, I never really understood that one.

581
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,529
Just 'cause someone makes their bed,

582
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:02,879
Why do they have to lie in it?

583
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,899
What's to stop them from lying in another bed

584
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,600
Or on the floor, for that matter?

585
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,520
Sam blakely's here.

586
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:13,810
I'm on it.

587
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:28,449
Officer blakely, thanks for coming.

588
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:31,720
I got no choice. You have my father locked up. Is your mother okay?

589
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:34,479
Don't worry about my mother. My father is innocent. We know that.

590
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,009
You people are making a big--what?

591
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:39,060
We know your father didn't do it.

592
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,219
This is from the security cameras

593
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,969
In the liquor store in front of the motel.

594
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:51,660
We finally got to look at it today. This is at 12:40 a.M.

595
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:55,440
That's patrice matigan's car arriving.

596
00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:00,220
And that is rick carris' man.

597
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:02,819
We misjudged carris.

598
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,639
He found patrice, had a man follow her.

599
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,159
You can see his license plate right there.

600
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,250
Can you make that bigger? Yes, we can.

601
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:13,609
We know who it is.

602
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:17,100
A thug that works for rick carris named q-tip. But get this.

603
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,169
Carris says q-tip didn't kill him.

604
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:21,749
Q-tip went to kill joe, but he got there too late.

605
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:25,219
Someone else got to him first. Well, that's gotta be a bunch of bull.

606
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:28,959
Carris says his man q-tip actually saw the real killer,

607
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,289
Saw the whole thing. So carris is offering us a deal.

608
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:34,359
If we let him out, his man q-tip

609
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,519
Will tell us exactly what he saw, i.D.

610
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,809
The real killer. And you believe him

611
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:41,529
Of course not. It's a transparent con.

612
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:42,709
Q-tip killed him all right.

613
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:44,189
Carris is just trying to save his skin

614
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:48,449
By laying the blame elsewhere. On your father probably.

615
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:51,219
He must have known about his connection to patrice.

616
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,069
So we're gonna play along,

617
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,819
Let the shooter come to us.

618
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:57,019
Carris has set up a meeting with q-tip tonight.

619
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:00,420
So we'll grab up q-tip and work him until we get the real story.

620
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:04,399
So, uh, what do you need me for exactly? If this is gonna work,

621
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,159
I can't have a whole bunch of angry davis p.D.

622
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,839
Swarming all over carris and his crew.

623
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:14,339
And the cbi is kind of unpopular with you guys right now. Yes, you are.

624
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:18,769
So... We were hoping you'd have a quiet word with your chief,

625
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,510
Let him know what we're up to.

626
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:23,279
Well, knowing the chief, he's gonna want to know the details,

627
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,279
Um, when and where you're gonna be meeting this q-tip

628
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,929
And what personnel you got operating undercover.

629
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:33,049
Sure. But this needs to stay close between you and the chief.

630
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:35,030
We don't want to spook carris.

631
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:37,950
He thinks he's playing us for a bunch of idiots.

632
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,010
Mm. I understand.

633
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,600
Okay, team. Let the games begin.

634
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,759
Carris is on his way.

635
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,959
He's gonna make the call when he makes the meet with q-tip.

636
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,280
Be ready to act fast. Clear?

637
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,110
Got it. Okay.

638
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,600
Roger that.

639
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,329
The warehouse is on fifth and geary.

640
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:30,619
Loading dock in the back. Q-tip's in the same car

641
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,419
He was on the tape. California plate

642
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:35,409
5-nora-tom-queen-9-5-7.

643
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:37,409
Be there in ten minutes. Ten minutes?

644
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:39,709
I can't get to fifth and geary in ten minutes

645
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:41,240
Well, do your best.

646
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:48,100
On our way. E.T.A. To geary and fifth--12 minutes.

647
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,890
Damn it. He won't wait that long.

648
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:03,170
Officer blakely, are you closer to fifth and geary?

649
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:08,110
Officer blakely?

650
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,770
Sam?

651
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,580
Blakely, drop the gun! Drop it!

652
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:15,770
Carris never made a deal, did he?

653
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,739
No.

654
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,660
We, uh, edited the surveillance footage.

655
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,129
Q-tip was just some guy

656
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:25,099
That happened to walk up to the motel at some point,

657
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,299
And, uh, van pelt--

658
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,980
She laid in the license plate with, uh, photoshop.

659
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:33,349
That's clever. Kudos to you guys.

660
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:35,609
We know you're a decent man, sam.

661
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:38,339
We know you didn't mean for things to go down like this.

662
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,469
Just tell us what happened. I got nothing to say.

663
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:43,789
There's no use in hiding anything now.

664
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:45,920
There's no use in explaining either

665
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:53,239
Mm. Take a seat, detective.

666
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,700
Thank you.

667
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,970
Son. Dad.

668
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,969
Well, there's--there's always a reckoning. This is it.

669
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:13,700
Just... Just tell them the truth.

670
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,570
The truth, huh?

671
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:18,160
Tell the truth no matter what.

672
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:21,559
That's the mark of a man, right, dad? Tell the truth.

673
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,799
A man has his honor and his word, and that's it.

674
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,169
Don't go over the same ground for god sake.

675
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:29,739
Just give 'em the facts. You want the facts? Okay.

676
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:32,469
Mom suspected that dad was having an affair.

677
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:34,340
Well, I asked around on the street.

678
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,760
Pretty soon I hear that he's keeping this girl,

679
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:40,100
Patrice matigan, on the side.

680
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:44,020
I was mad as hell.

681
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:45,349
You gotta understand.

682
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:48,559
This integrity crap was banged into me my entire life.

683
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,839
Right, dad?

684
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,009
Honesty, honor, family-- banged into me,

685
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,189
And then all this time, he's keeping a whore on the side?

686
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:59,220
No. Never. I went and I asked him if it was true,

687
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,610
And he said no.

688
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:06,020
I knew he was lying to me. I knew it.

689
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:10,670
So sunday night i... Went back to find the truth.

690
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,040
I thought, for sure, she was gonna meet dad.

691
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:17,630
And she went to the store, went to a motel.

692
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:23,320
I thought, "aha, I got him now."

693
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:36,859
Purcell must have thought

694
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:40,980
I'd been sent by carris to kill him. I had no choice.

695
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,620
I panicked.

696
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,660
I drove away.

697
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:00,190
And dispatch called,

698
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:02,940
Sent me right back to the motel.

699
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,290
I was the closest unit. What was I gonna do? Refuse the call?

700
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,940
I had to take it.

701
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,790
There's always a reckoning.

702
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:21,080
Patrice wasn't your mistress, was she?

703
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,990
No.

704
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:30,040
She was my daughter,

705
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:32,160
Sam's sister.

706
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:35,650
How did you know?

707
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:38,270
Sam told his mother you weren't cheating on her.

708
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,690
I believed him. But then who was patrice?

709
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:45,270
Who was she to you?

710
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:47,219
And why all the secrecy?

711
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:50,339
I just figured she had to have been your daughter.

712
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:54,170
I never knew patrice existed until four years ago.

713
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:56,379
Her mother was dying.

714
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,860
So...

715
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:00,260
She got in touch,

716
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,309
Told me I had

717
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:06,610
A 16-year-old child I never knew about.

718
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:10,790
Blew my mind. Just...

719
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,380
Oh, blew my mind.

720
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,099
You know, I wanted to tell katherine the truth,

721
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,470
But...

722
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:22,710
Y-you know, i...

723
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,600
Oh, my god.

724
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,340
I couldn't do it.

725
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:34,080
I just couldn't hurt her like that.

726
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,909
Does she know now?

727
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,620
Yeah, she knows.

728
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:40,700
She knows.

729
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,909
Sorry. Busy right now.

730
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:31,840
Katherine, it's patrick jane.

731
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,410
Can you open the door?

732
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,179
I can't.

733
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:37,079
You can and you will.

734
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,140
I have something I need to give you.

735
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,449
This is kaylee,

736
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:48,799
Your granddaughter, kind of.

737
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,080
Here.

738
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,129
She's very fond of cheerios.

739
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:55,909
That's, uh, that has nothing to do with me.

740
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:59,349
And she likes to take her big nap at 2:00. But--what?

741
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:00,439
You're all she has.

742
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,199
Social services will be along later

743
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,170
To get the paperwork signed.

744
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:07,429
The name kaylee doesn't really suit her, if you ask me.

745
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:09,919
If you want to change it, I'm sure no one will make a fuss.

746
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,680
Oh. Oh. Hey. You might need those. Bye.
