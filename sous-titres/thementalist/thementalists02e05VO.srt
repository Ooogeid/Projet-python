1
00:00:47,245 --> 00:00:49,178
Hello?

2
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,799
What the hell?

3
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:06,500
Beckworth Mansion,
Eagle Creek, California

4
00:01:06,532 --> 00:01:09,299
I appreciate your people
coming in on this, agent lisbon.

5
00:01:09,332 --> 00:01:12,833
Haven't handled many
homicides-- none, in fact.

6
00:01:12,899 --> 00:01:14,933
Frankly, I'm looking to learn from you.

7
00:01:14,966 --> 00:01:16,933
Not a problem, deputy fisher.

8
00:01:16,966 --> 00:01:18,933
Small town. We don't get much trouble.

9
00:01:18,966 --> 00:01:20,933
Well, that's a shame.

10
00:01:20,966 --> 00:01:22,933
Trouble's your business.

11
00:01:22,966 --> 00:01:24,866
You could say.

12
00:01:24,933 --> 00:01:26,866
Victim's
alan foster--

13
00:01:26,933 --> 00:01:29,833
43 years old, married, no children.

14
00:01:29,899 --> 00:01:32,332
Architect. He bought the
house a few months back,

15
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:34,666
Said he was gonna rehab it.

16
00:01:34,733 --> 00:01:37,432
Was the wife with him last night?

17
00:01:37,466 --> 00:01:39,499
No, she was in the city. They
have a house in san francisco.

18
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:41,533
I sent a man to break the news.

19
00:01:41,533 --> 00:01:42,033
Was anybody else in the house with him?

20
00:01:42,033 --> 00:01:44,532
Nobody as far as we can tell.

21
00:01:44,532 --> 00:01:45,599
I don't know what to say.

22
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:47,332
The house was locked up tighter
than a drum when I got here.

23
00:01:47,366 --> 00:01:49,566
Took me half an hour just
to shut off the alarm.

24
00:01:49,566 --> 00:01:51,332
Cho, check the alarm system.

25
00:01:51,366 --> 00:01:53,899
Either the victim let somebody
in, or they broke in someplace.

26
00:01:53,966 --> 00:01:57,332
It's a shame. Foster
seemed like a nice guy.

27
00:01:57,366 --> 00:02:00,265
Whoa, that's a lie. You
didn't like him one bit.

28
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,247
- W--i-I didn't say
that. - Yes, you did.

29
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,899
You thought he was rich,
arrogant, pretentious,

30
00:02:04,966 --> 00:02:08,232
An interloper. He wore those
trendy architect's glasses.

31
00:02:08,299 --> 00:02:10,199
Did you kill him?

32
00:02:10,299 --> 00:02:12,366
Did i...

33
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:17,399
No.

34
00:02:17,466 --> 00:02:18,666
No.

35
00:02:20,066 --> 00:02:23,532
What kind of question is that?

36
00:02:30,132 --> 00:02:33,232
He's got something in his hand.

37
00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:36,899
- Jane! Gloves.
- Right.

38
00:02:43,066 --> 00:02:47,833
A brass button with the letter "b"?

39
00:02:47,866 --> 00:02:50,066
That mean something to you, deputy?

40
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,699
No.

41
00:02:54,933 --> 00:02:56,432
What's this guy's problem?

42
00:02:56,499 --> 00:02:59,966
That would take way too long to answer.

43
00:03:00,033 --> 00:03:01,132
Let's take a look inside.

44
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,933
Okay. It's this way.

45
00:03:16,801 --> 00:03:18,899
Clear signs of struggle
rules out suicide.

46
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:22,866
That, and suicides usually open
the window before they jump.

47
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,732
What's troubling you, fisher?

48
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,035
What? Nothing. What
are you talking about?

49
00:03:29,035 --> 00:03:30,648
That button made your pupils dilate.

50
00:03:30,649 --> 00:03:31,858
Now you've gone pale.

51
00:03:32,731 --> 00:03:34,387
What's up, fisher? What's troubling you?

52
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,967
Well, it occurred to me that the button

53
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:41,967
Could stand for "beckworth,"

54
00:03:42,001 --> 00:03:45,334
- And I got a little chill, that's all.
- Who's beckworth?

55
00:03:45,401 --> 00:03:47,334
Walter beckworth.

56
00:03:47,401 --> 00:03:50,101
He was the original owner
of this house--built it.

57
00:03:50,134 --> 00:03:54,934
Died 80-something years ago.
People say he haunts the place.

58
00:03:54,967 --> 00:03:56,595
I've heard the stories
since I was a kid,

59
00:03:56,595 --> 00:03:59,991
- But nobody believes them.
- Right.

60
00:04:00,396 --> 00:04:02,222
Guy from the security
company ran the alarm history.

61
00:04:02,222 --> 00:04:03,821
It's been up 6 hours since last night

62
00:04:03,821 --> 00:04:05,163
Until the deputies turned
it off this morning.

63
00:04:05,588 --> 00:04:06,970
No alarms or interruptions of service.

64
00:04:07,311 --> 00:04:09,964
As far as I can tell, no one's
entered or left this building

65
00:04:10,171 --> 00:04:15,470
- Except the victim.
- But that's impossible. Isn't it?

66
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,800
Spooky.

67
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,039
I'm not saying volunteering
is better work than this,

68
00:04:31,106 --> 00:04:33,373
But it makes me feel better
at the end of the day.

69
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,373
I see people smiling
because of what I've done.

70
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:38,039
There's something, i
don't know, joyous in it.

71
00:04:38,106 --> 00:04:40,080
How often do we see
people smile in this job?

72
00:04:40,081 --> 00:04:42,054
Leaving or crazy, never

73
00:04:42,054 --> 00:04:43,432
The coroner took foster's body.

74
00:04:43,465 --> 00:04:45,465
I'm gonna get his wife and
bring her to the office.

75
00:04:45,499 --> 00:04:48,165
- Lisbon and jane are up on the porch.
- Okay, thanks.

76
00:04:48,198 --> 00:04:50,165
She's volunteering
at a homeless kitchen.

77
00:04:50,198 --> 00:04:51,899
That's cool.

78
00:04:51,966 --> 00:04:53,764
There's a man there.
I think she's, you know

79
00:04:53,765 --> 00:04:55,666
Banging home with this guy

80
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:58,532
No! A volunteer. A
chef. And she's not--

81
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:02,899
I don't know. Not yet...
maybe... I think...

82
00:05:02,966 --> 00:05:06,098
I don't... no.

83
00:05:06,165 --> 00:05:09,499
Dude, you need counseling.

84
00:05:16,365 --> 00:05:18,332
Somehow the killer got into the house

85
00:05:18,365 --> 00:05:21,165
Without tripping the
alarm or turning it off.

86
00:05:21,198 --> 00:05:22,865
So the killer didn't come
through the front door.

87
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:24,566
Probably found some kind
of hole in the system.

88
00:05:24,632 --> 00:05:26,566
Check the grounds and inside the house.

89
00:05:26,632 --> 00:05:28,699
- Find out how they got in.
- On it.

90
00:05:28,732 --> 00:05:31,732
Grace, you're the spiritual
sort. Do you believe in ghosts?

91
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:33,732
I believe the spirit survives death,

92
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:36,265
And a troubled spirit
can make itself known.

93
00:05:36,332 --> 00:05:39,232
Oh, come on. You don't seriously
think there's a ghost here.

94
00:05:39,265 --> 00:05:41,265
Meh. I don't know.

95
00:05:41,332 --> 00:05:43,866
If you see one, let me know.

96
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:49,388
CBI HQ, Sacramento. California

97
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:52,532
How long had your husband been
staying at beckworth mansion,

98
00:05:52,566 --> 00:05:54,098
Mrs. Foster?

99
00:05:54,165 --> 00:05:57,799
Off and on for about three
weeks, since we closed on it.

100
00:05:57,866 --> 00:05:59,799
Why? It's pretty run-down.

101
00:05:59,866 --> 00:06:02,033
To get a feel for the house
before he worked on it.

102
00:06:02,065 --> 00:06:04,332
He said you should
spend a month in a house

103
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:06,666
Before you thought about changing it.

104
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,399
He's conscientious that way...

105
00:06:08,432 --> 00:06:13,299
Or was conscientious that way.

106
00:06:13,365 --> 00:06:16,399
We can take a break if you'd like.

107
00:06:16,432 --> 00:06:19,265
No, no, no. Let's--
let's just get through it.

108
00:06:19,299 --> 00:06:22,132
- So you were at home the night of your husband's murder?
- Yes.

109
00:06:22,198 --> 00:06:25,132
We have to ask--is there
anyone who can verify that?

110
00:06:25,198 --> 00:06:27,399
Um, no, I was alone.

111
00:06:27,432 --> 00:06:30,332
Alan had been at the mansion all week.

112
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,899
Was it common for you and your
husband to be apart that long?

113
00:06:32,933 --> 00:06:36,033
It was not uncommon when
he started a project.

114
00:06:36,065 --> 00:06:38,165
He got immersed.

115
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:40,499
Who might have wanted
to hurt your husband?

116
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,065
Oh, I can tell you who
was angry with him--

117
00:06:43,098 --> 00:06:44,699
Victoria abner.

118
00:06:44,732 --> 00:06:48,632
- Who's she? -She's this
hippie-dippy woman who lives in town,

119
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:51,065
And she weaves linens and rugs.

120
00:06:51,098 --> 00:06:53,265
She used to own beckworth.

121
00:06:53,299 --> 00:06:56,165
She's a descendant of
the man who built it.

122
00:06:56,232 --> 00:06:58,699
She resented your husband
for buying the place?

123
00:06:58,766 --> 00:07:00,699
But not at first.

124
00:07:00,766 --> 00:07:03,165
There were tax issues that
came with the property,

125
00:07:03,232 --> 00:07:05,599
So we thought she'd be
glad to be rid of it.

126
00:07:05,632 --> 00:07:07,933
But... about a week after we closed,

127
00:07:07,999 --> 00:07:10,532
She just blew up, claimed
that alan stole the house.

128
00:07:10,632 --> 00:07:12,299
It was vicious.

129
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,799
Did she ever threaten your husband?

130
00:07:14,866 --> 00:07:16,966
She sent some pretty scary e-mails.

131
00:07:20,132 --> 00:07:22,132
Excuse me.

132
00:07:23,966 --> 00:07:26,699
We need to see those e-mails.

133
00:07:26,766 --> 00:07:28,699
What?

134
00:07:28,766 --> 00:07:30,699
Walter beckworth
was killed in 1928--

135
00:07:30,766 --> 00:07:32,766
Fight over a woman. You know how?

136
00:07:32,799 --> 00:07:34,866
No, and I don't care.

137
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:37,265
He was thrown out of
the exact same window

138
00:07:37,299 --> 00:07:39,966
That alan foster was
thrown out of. Coincidence?

139
00:07:39,999 --> 00:07:41,632
Yes.

140
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:44,566
Yeah. Well, it's all here.
Is that, uh, foster's widow?

141
00:07:44,632 --> 00:07:47,198
I need to talk to her.

142
00:07:47,265 --> 00:07:49,165
Mrs. Foster? Patrick jane.

143
00:07:49,198 --> 00:07:52,732
Did your husband see or hear
anything odd at the mansion--

144
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:55,532
Strange sightings, unusual
noises, apparitions?

145
00:07:55,566 --> 00:07:59,566
As a matter of fact, alan did
mention some strange things.

146
00:07:59,632 --> 00:08:02,999
What kind of things? Um,
in the last week or so

147
00:08:03,033 --> 00:08:05,399
He heard some noises
at night, like groans.

148
00:08:05,465 --> 00:08:08,399
He said sometimes it looked
like things were being moved.

149
00:08:08,465 --> 00:08:12,098
I know it's a little creepy,
but alan wasn't too bothered.

150
00:08:12,165 --> 00:08:14,098
He was used to old houses.

151
00:08:14,165 --> 00:08:16,699
What does this have
to do with how he died?

152
00:08:16,732 --> 00:08:19,365
Victoria abner has no
arrests, but three years ago

153
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,365
A neighbor took out a restraining order

154
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:23,699
Against her--some argument
about the neighbor's dog.

155
00:08:23,732 --> 00:08:25,933
Victoria got a little
in-your-face about it.

156
00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:27,933
Go and see how mad she really was

157
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:30,165
- About foster buying the mansion.
- Okay.

158
00:08:30,198 --> 00:08:32,165
And be sure to ask about the ghost, too.

159
00:08:32,198 --> 00:08:34,899
Do not ask about ghosts.

160
00:08:34,999 --> 00:08:37,299
Don't you think I
know what you're doing?

161
00:08:37,365 --> 00:08:38,632
No ghosts.

162
00:08:38,699 --> 00:08:40,966
The ghost has something
to do with foster's death.

163
00:08:41,033 --> 00:08:43,766
No, it doesn't, because
ghosts don't exist.

164
00:08:43,832 --> 00:08:46,399
Don't exist in your mind,

165
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,766
But if you believe they
exist, then they exist.

166
00:08:53,198 --> 00:08:54,566
Anything?

167
00:08:54,599 --> 00:08:56,566
No pry marks on any
of the frames so far,

168
00:08:56,599 --> 00:08:59,098
No footprints under the windows.

169
00:08:59,132 --> 00:09:01,399
I don't see any sign of forced entry.

170
00:09:01,432 --> 00:09:03,299
Maybe it was a ghost.

171
00:09:03,365 --> 00:09:05,399
Ghosts don't throw
200-pound men out windows.

172
00:09:05,432 --> 00:09:07,365
What do ghosts do?

173
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:10,732
I have no idea. Let's
check the other side.

174
00:09:15,465 --> 00:09:20,098
So you gonna keep volunteering
at the, uh, kitchen?

175
00:09:20,132 --> 00:09:21,632
Oh, yeah.

176
00:09:21,699 --> 00:09:24,198
Making a lot of new friends, I expect.

177
00:09:24,232 --> 00:09:25,699
I am.

178
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,165
Yeah, that's the great thing
about doing volunteer work.

179
00:09:28,232 --> 00:09:30,832
You meet so many new people
that have the same kind

180
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:32,832
Of values and interests as you.

181
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:35,599
- Right. Hey, look at that.

182
00:09:35,632 --> 00:09:38,732
- What? The lock on
the door-- looks new.

183
00:09:38,766 --> 00:09:40,666
Someone cut it open.

184
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:48,766
Well, if they haven't started
work on the house yet...

185
00:09:56,666 --> 00:10:00,132
All the power tools are missing.

186
00:10:02,499 --> 00:10:04,165
What's there?

187
00:10:04,232 --> 00:10:06,332
You think ghosts smoke filtered?

188
00:10:06,365 --> 00:10:08,866
Boss, someone broke into a storage area,

189
00:10:08,933 --> 00:10:11,566
Stole a whole bunch of
equipment and supplies.

190
00:10:11,632 --> 00:10:13,966
Maybe they broke into the house, too.

191
00:10:30,332 --> 00:10:32,299
Can I help you?

192
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:36,499
I see you specialize in local history.

193
00:10:36,532 --> 00:10:37,966
Mr...

194
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:40,399
Raimey. Philip raimey. Yes, and you are?

195
00:10:40,465 --> 00:10:42,732
Looking for information
on walter beckworth.

196
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:44,732
Are you with the police?

197
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:47,332
Here about the foster incident?

198
00:10:47,365 --> 00:10:49,332
Yes, but don't tell anyone.

199
00:10:49,365 --> 00:10:52,033
Patrick jane.

200
00:10:52,065 --> 00:10:55,065
Well, mr. Jane, if it's
beckworth you're interested in,

201
00:10:55,132 --> 00:10:57,832
You've come to the right place.

202
00:11:00,465 --> 00:11:02,399
Thank you.

203
00:11:02,465 --> 00:11:04,532
Great store.

204
00:11:04,566 --> 00:11:07,365
Agent cho, of course I
was angry with foster.

205
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:10,299
If someone stole your home,
wouldn't you be angry as well?

206
00:11:10,332 --> 00:11:13,098
- He bought the house, mrs. Abner.
- You don't understand.

207
00:11:13,165 --> 00:11:14,298
A house you haven't lived
in since you were a child.

208
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:15,432
That's not the point.

209
00:11:15,499 --> 00:11:17,933
Sorry. I didn't know
you were with somebody.

210
00:11:17,999 --> 00:11:20,499
Oh, this is my nephew drew.

211
00:11:20,532 --> 00:11:25,033
Agent cho is asking
questions about alan foster.

212
00:11:25,065 --> 00:11:27,132
He wants to know why I was so upset

213
00:11:27,198 --> 00:11:29,632
With the man who stole beckworth.

214
00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:32,732
- It is a complicated issue.
- No, it's not that complicated.

215
00:11:32,766 --> 00:11:35,465
There are many factors
to be considered--

216
00:11:35,532 --> 00:11:37,132
Economic and emotional.

217
00:11:37,198 --> 00:11:40,599
My nephew is a lawyer.
He's very sensible.

218
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,599
That's good, because I'm not.

219
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,599
There are no factors to consider.

220
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:46,732
Foster was a thief and a liar.

221
00:11:46,766 --> 00:11:48,899
You couldn't afford
the taxes on the house.

222
00:11:48,933 --> 00:11:51,432
You were grateful when
he first purchased it.

223
00:11:51,465 --> 00:11:53,152
What changed your mind?

224
00:11:53,153 --> 00:11:54,465
You have a very good aura.

225
00:11:54,532 --> 00:11:56,132
Thank you.

226
00:11:56,198 --> 00:11:59,232
Excellent
color--deep red...

227
00:11:59,265 --> 00:12:02,165
Grounded, realistic.

228
00:12:02,232 --> 00:12:06,132
And foster's aura was pink,

229
00:12:06,198 --> 00:12:08,933
Dirty pink.

230
00:12:08,966 --> 00:12:10,899
That's dishonesty, fecklessness.

231
00:12:10,933 --> 00:12:11,724
When he came to me

232
00:12:11,725 --> 00:12:13,966
He said he wanted to preserve Beckworth.

233
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:15,832
He lied to me.

234
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:18,832
He wanted to gut it--
my childhood home,

235
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:20,832
And I couldn't let him do that.

236
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:23,766
Look, agent, the beckworth
mansion is understandably

237
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:25,766
A very emotional subject for my family,

238
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:28,232
But whatever she may have felt or said,

239
00:12:28,265 --> 00:12:30,766
My aunt is incapable of hurting anybody.

240
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:32,999
Where were you last night?

241
00:12:33,065 --> 00:12:34,999
In my home,

242
00:12:35,065 --> 00:12:38,198
In my bed, not killing Alan Foster.

243
00:12:38,265 --> 00:12:39,532
What about you?

244
00:12:39,599 --> 00:12:41,832
I was here. I've been
staying with my aunt

245
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:44,666
On and off ever since she
was forced to sell the place.

246
00:12:44,732 --> 00:12:47,265
He's been helping me
out with my legal things.

247
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:48,739
I'd be lost without him.

248
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,766
Tax liens and escrow--
nothing too complicated.

249
00:12:53,499 --> 00:12:55,065
Excuse me.

250
00:12:57,499 --> 00:12:58,832
Cho.

251
00:12:58,866 --> 00:13:02,165
Cho, did you ask about the ghost?

252
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,532
No, you heard lisbon.

253
00:13:06,033 --> 00:13:08,265
I am talking to the local historian.

254
00:13:08,299 --> 00:13:10,766
Apparently, Beckworth was
deeply involved in spiritualism.

255
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:12,766
Liked to explore the world beyond,

256
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:15,098
Held sences and all
that kind of malarkey.

257
00:13:15,132 --> 00:13:17,265
So ghosts are relevant, my friend.

258
00:13:17,299 --> 00:13:19,365
This is very important.

259
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:21,232
Cho?

260
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:23,365
Don't leave me hanging.

261
00:13:23,432 --> 00:13:27,033
Ma'am, do you know anything
about ghost at the mansion?

262
00:13:27,065 --> 00:13:28,666
Of course.

263
00:13:28,699 --> 00:13:31,766
That's the spirit of my
grandfather Walter Beckworth.

264
00:13:31,832 --> 00:13:34,325
He used to visit me when I was a child.

265
00:13:34,326 --> 00:13:35,365
She says there's a ghost.

266
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:39,198
Thank you. No surprise there.

267
00:13:39,232 --> 00:13:41,365
Mmm. Clover honey?

268
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:43,499
Yes, as a matter of fact it is.

269
00:13:46,532 --> 00:13:49,198
- Jane?
- Mm. Sorry.

270
00:13:49,232 --> 00:13:52,566
Uh, Mr. Raimey says there's
also a hidden treasure there.

271
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:54,532
Rumored treasure, purely rumored.

272
00:13:54,566 --> 00:13:55,670
Rumored treasure

273
00:13:55,671 --> 00:13:58,432
Some fortune Beckworth hid in the house.

274
00:13:58,499 --> 00:14:00,465
Does abner know anything about that?

275
00:14:00,532 --> 00:14:02,033
Beckworth's treasure?

276
00:14:02,065 --> 00:14:03,766
Oh, yes.

277
00:14:03,832 --> 00:14:06,232
Everybody in the family
knew that there was

278
00:14:06,265 --> 00:14:08,566
A great, mythic treasure.

279
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:11,632
We gave up looking for it
years ago. It was a fraud.

280
00:14:11,699 --> 00:14:13,632
If it wasn't, do you
think I'd be living here?

281
00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:15,599
She says no treasure.

282
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:18,465
Hmm. Got it. Thank you.

283
00:14:18,532 --> 00:14:19,899
Okay.

284
00:14:19,933 --> 00:14:22,265
No treasure.

285
00:14:22,332 --> 00:14:24,532
Clover honey.

286
00:14:28,532 --> 00:14:32,699
Well... thank you.

287
00:14:32,732 --> 00:14:35,098
If there is anything else I can do...

288
00:14:35,132 --> 00:14:37,098
Well, there is one more thing.

289
00:14:37,132 --> 00:14:39,132
How did Beckworth make his money?

290
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:42,033
Oh, he was a bootlegger--
very successful one.

291
00:14:42,065 --> 00:14:45,332
It's in, uh, that one,
the second from the bottom.

292
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:47,332
Okay. Thank you.

293
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:49,766
Uh, did you ever cross
paths with foster?

294
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:51,799
Once or twice.

295
00:14:51,866 --> 00:14:53,499
He seemed pleasant enough.

296
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,132
Never paid very much attention.

297
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:57,933
- You deceitful old bag of bones.
- Excuse me?

298
00:14:57,966 --> 00:15:00,232
You heard me.

299
00:15:02,976 --> 00:15:04,732
Nothing on the exterior of the house.

300
00:15:04,766 --> 00:15:06,766
Let's check inside.

301
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:08,432
That's weird.

302
00:15:08,465 --> 00:15:09,766
What?

303
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:11,799
Thought this was shut.

304
00:15:20,232 --> 00:15:22,065
Did you hear that?

305
00:15:22,098 --> 00:15:24,065
Yeah. Someone's upstairs.

306
00:15:24,098 --> 00:15:26,265
I thought everybody left.

307
00:15:30,432 --> 00:15:31,966
Hello?

308
00:15:43,299 --> 00:15:46,332
It came from in there.

309
00:15:55,132 --> 00:15:58,033
Old wiring, I guess.

310
00:15:58,098 --> 00:15:59,465
What was that?

311
00:15:59,499 --> 00:16:01,465
CBI. Come out.

312
00:16:07,365 --> 00:16:09,365
Police. Whoever you
are, come out of the room

313
00:16:09,432 --> 00:16:12,999
With your hands above your head.

314
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,933
Jane?

315
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,700
- Where'd he go?
- How'd he do that?

316
00:16:38,767 --> 00:16:40,566
It's easy.

317
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:41,640
I'll show you.

318
00:16:43,767 --> 00:16:44,997
Ah, you see?

319
00:16:46,295 --> 00:16:49,169
It's all switches.

320
00:16:53,868 --> 00:16:54,878
There's a system of pipes that

321
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:56,732
Carry sound throughout the house.

322
00:16:59,933 --> 00:17:02,700
- Hello? - Yeah.
It's all fake--

323
00:17:02,767 --> 00:17:04,566
Because, my credulous van pelt

324
00:17:04,567 --> 00:17:06,366
spirits are smoke and mirrors

325
00:17:06,433 --> 00:17:08,366
And that's all that they are.

326
00:17:08,433 --> 00:17:11,139
And the ghost? How did you do that?

327
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,299
Ah, the piste de resistance.

328
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:14,566
If you could stand in the
corner, my friend Rigsby,

329
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:17,284
And, Grace, if you could take
your place out by the doors.

330
00:17:17,862 --> 00:17:19,372
Pepper's ghost.

331
00:17:20,033 --> 00:17:23,448
It's an old conjurer's trick--
a simple optical illusion.

332
00:17:23,448 --> 00:17:25,990
All you need is a sheet of glass

333
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:28,058
That slides out of the wall...

334
00:17:31,712 --> 00:17:32,715
It's a reflection?

335
00:17:33,626 --> 00:17:34,755
And lighting.

336
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,723
And off.

337
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,981
Bbeckworth had all this built

338
00:17:50,982 --> 00:17:51,556
Just so he could hold sences?

339
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,989
So he could amaze and terrify his guests

340
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:56,585
With his mastery of the occult,
and it's been used recently.

341
00:17:56,585 --> 00:17:58,445
Someone has cleaned the dust off.

342
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,955
- So somebody was trying
to scare Foster. - Mm-hmm.

343
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,959
- Why?
- And how did they get in the house?

344
00:18:02,959 --> 00:18:06,957
- The alarm would have been on the whole time.
- Come with me.

345
00:18:07,033 --> 00:18:09,167
Beckworth was a bootlegger
during prohibition,

346
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,967
Which meant he had to
smuggle liquor into the house

347
00:18:12,033 --> 00:18:13,967
And hide it someplace

348
00:18:14,033 --> 00:18:15,967
The authorities couldn't find it.

349
00:18:16,033 --> 00:18:18,433
This house is riddled
with secret passages.

350
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,200
Including ones that lead outside?

351
00:18:31,134 --> 00:18:33,234
Head down. Take a look.

352
00:18:33,266 --> 00:18:35,266
I'll check the outside walls.

353
00:18:35,299 --> 00:18:37,167
No doubt one of us will
find the secret passage.

354
00:18:37,234 --> 00:18:39,466
After you.

355
00:18:39,533 --> 00:18:41,533
Oh, thank you.

356
00:18:56,867 --> 00:18:58,299
Jeb haas?

357
00:18:58,366 --> 00:19:00,134
Who wants to know?

358
00:19:00,167 --> 00:19:02,155
Agent Lisbon, C.B.I.

359
00:19:02,156 --> 00:19:03,433
Pretty little thing like you?

360
00:19:03,466 --> 00:19:07,100
I have some questions for you
regarding Alan Foster's murder.

361
00:19:07,134 --> 00:19:10,000
I got nothing to tell you.

362
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:12,800
Looks like there were some
construction supplies stolen

363
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,800
Around the time of the murder.

364
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,800
Deputy Fisher says
you're the local thief

365
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,900
Most likely to steal that kind of stuff.

366
00:19:18,933 --> 00:19:21,399
Fisher sent you? That son of a bitch.

367
00:19:21,433 --> 00:19:23,399
I don't know what he told you,

368
00:19:23,433 --> 00:19:26,600
But, um, I don't know anything
about a break-in or any murder.

369
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:29,399
Then you won't mind coming
down to the station with me.

370
00:19:29,433 --> 00:19:31,326
What if I don't want to go?

371
00:19:31,327 --> 00:19:34,167
Sir, this doesn't have to be difficult.

372
00:19:43,967 --> 00:19:45,867
You okay?

373
00:19:45,933 --> 00:19:48,200
Yeah, yeah. You?

374
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,711
Hey, look at that. Wine cellar.

375
00:19:59,712 --> 00:20:01,433
Wonder if any of it's still good.

376
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:03,500
I doubt it.

377
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:07,466
- What was that?
- Eh, probably rats.

378
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,867
Oh, god, no. I hate rats.

379
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,833
- It's just a ghost then.
- You don't believe in ghosts.

380
00:20:12,867 --> 00:20:15,167
Yeah, but you do. Wait
upstairs, if you like.

381
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,167
I'll take this one.

382
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,200
Oh, thanks. That's okay.

383
00:20:22,466 --> 00:20:25,433
Same night that Foster was killed,

384
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,089
You broke into his pool house
and stole a few thousand dollars

385
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,034
Worth of tools and equipment.

386
00:20:30,035 --> 00:20:33,000
We know because we found some of
the stolen equipment in your vehicle

387
00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:34,633
And we found this cigarette
butt in the pool house.

388
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,566
It'll definitely have your D.N.A. on it.

389
00:20:37,633 --> 00:20:39,800
Everybody knows that
place is all wired up

390
00:20:39,867 --> 00:20:41,800
With some fancy alarm system.

391
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:43,800
I didn't kill anybody.

392
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:46,700
I never saw Foster, and I
never went into his house.

393
00:20:46,733 --> 00:20:49,033
- Nice if you could prove that.
- I can't,

394
00:20:49,067 --> 00:20:52,167
But I do have some particular
information on that evening--

395
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,867
Information that you want.

396
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,266
Okay.

397
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:59,333
Unh-unh. Not until I
get a deal on the theft

398
00:20:59,366 --> 00:21:01,333
And the breaking and
entering charges--

399
00:21:01,366 --> 00:21:05,100
- A good one, too.
- You want a deal? Okay.

400
00:21:05,167 --> 00:21:07,600
And just to be clear, is
this a deal for the theft

401
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:11,366
- And the b&e alone, or the tax evasion as well?
- What?

402
00:21:11,399 --> 00:21:13,399
According to your I.R.S. records,

403
00:21:13,433 --> 00:21:15,733
You haven't filed a
tax return since 2002.

404
00:21:15,767 --> 00:21:18,600
Unless you haven't earned a
dime in income in seven years,

405
00:21:18,633 --> 00:21:20,800
You're facing some pretty
serious tax evasion charges.

406
00:21:20,867 --> 00:21:22,933
Do you have any idea how
much prison time that carries?

407
00:21:22,933 --> 00:21:24,733
Prison time?

408
00:21:24,767 --> 00:21:28,234
Serious time, massive fines.

409
00:21:28,266 --> 00:21:30,433
I'm gonna let you think about it.

410
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,234
When I was loading stuff
out of the pool house,

411
00:21:35,266 --> 00:21:37,399
I saw a car
in the woods--

412
00:21:37,433 --> 00:21:39,000
A black BMW.

413
00:21:39,067 --> 00:21:41,134
There was somebody sitting
in the driver's seat--

414
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,466
Foster's wife.

415
00:21:42,533 --> 00:21:44,399
Lillian Foster?

416
00:21:44,433 --> 00:21:47,234
I've seen her in town. She
sat there the whole time.

417
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:50,266
She never even noticed me.
She just stared at the house.

418
00:21:50,299 --> 00:21:52,333
Was she still there when you left?

419
00:21:52,399 --> 00:21:54,500
Yes.

420
00:21:57,234 --> 00:21:58,533
So you'll do
something--

421
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,833
I mean, about the tax thing?

422
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,767
Don't worry. I was lying about that.

423
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:16,700
What's wrong with it?

424
00:22:16,767 --> 00:22:18,500
I don't know. Maybe the batteries.

425
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,566
Don't hit it.

426
00:22:20,633 --> 00:22:22,566
Fine. You fix it then.

427
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,600
Let's just use mine.

428
00:22:26,533 --> 00:22:28,134
What? What? What?

429
00:22:28,167 --> 00:22:30,032
Oh! Oh, I felt something
crawling up my leg.

430
00:22:30,033 --> 00:22:30,566
Oh! Is it still there?

431
00:22:30,633 --> 00:22:32,733
- No.
- It was probably just a ghost.

432
00:22:38,433 --> 00:22:40,134
Grace?

433
00:22:40,167 --> 00:22:42,134
Yes?

434
00:22:42,167 --> 00:22:44,967
I...

435
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,967
Never mind.

436
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,399
Never mind.

437
00:22:48,466 --> 00:22:50,900
Maybe we should keep going.

438
00:22:52,033 --> 00:22:54,266
Grace, I love you.

439
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:57,933
I've loved you from the
first moment I met you.

440
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,833
Screw the rules. Screw
the CBI. I need you.

441
00:23:00,867 --> 00:23:02,433
I, uh...

442
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,067
That's, um...

443
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:07,100
Unless you stop me,
I'm gonna kiss you now.

444
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:12,200
Eureka!

445
00:23:12,234 --> 00:23:14,167
Found it!

446
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:21,451
Good work. Yeah, we'll
meet you back at the office

447
00:23:21,518 --> 00:23:23,209
After we pick up lillian foster.

448
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:25,384
We're outside her house now.

449
00:23:25,417 --> 00:23:28,751
Jane says he found another
entrance to the mansion.

450
00:23:28,751 --> 00:23:30,618
I knew there had to be another way in.

451
00:23:30,684 --> 00:23:31,684
How dare you come here, you crazy bitch!

452
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,828
My husband just died!

453
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:33,784
Is that victoria abner and her nephew?

454
00:23:33,784 --> 00:23:34,984
What are they doing here?

455
00:23:34,985 --> 00:23:36,117
It seemed like a good idea to me.

456
00:23:36,184 --> 00:23:38,112
Have you no shame?

457
00:23:38,113 --> 00:23:40,151
Mrs. Foster, if you could
just please calm down.

458
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:41,185
You know what you are? You're a vulture.

459
00:23:41,185 --> 00:23:42,185
You're a crazy, obsessed old vulture!

460
00:23:42,185 --> 00:23:43,185
That mansion is mine.

461
00:23:43,185 --> 00:23:44,185
It belongs to my family.

462
00:23:44,185 --> 00:23:47,185
I will burn it down before
you step foot in that place!

463
00:23:47,284 --> 00:23:50,117
Lady, you need psychiatric help.

464
00:23:50,184 --> 00:23:52,384
Oh, yeah? Hey!

465
00:23:52,417 --> 00:23:55,751
Hey! Break it up!

466
00:23:55,784 --> 00:23:57,751
Aah! Get her off of me now!

467
00:23:57,784 --> 00:24:00,751
What the hell is the matter
with you?! Come on. Come on.

468
00:24:00,784 --> 00:24:02,751
You have no class! You're
the one that came to my house!

469
00:24:04,784 --> 00:24:07,618
You come to my house-- Oh,
yeah, I'm the crazy bitch?

470
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:16,117
How you feeling, Mrs. Foster?

471
00:24:16,184 --> 00:24:18,384
Embarrassed.

472
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:22,651
How'd you get into the
ruckus with Ms. Abner?

473
00:24:22,718 --> 00:24:26,351
She came by to ask if she could
rent the mansion back from me,

474
00:24:26,417 --> 00:24:29,084
Seeing as how I won't
want to be living there.

475
00:24:29,117 --> 00:24:30,918
Did she say why?

476
00:24:30,951 --> 00:24:33,150
I, uh, didn't wait to hear the details.

477
00:24:33,217 --> 00:24:36,284
She had been plaguing us
all this time, and now this?

478
00:24:36,317 --> 00:24:40,918
I'm afraid I just... lost it.

479
00:24:42,951 --> 00:24:46,251
There is something else we
wanted to talk to you about.

480
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:48,684
You weren't in San Francisco

481
00:24:48,751 --> 00:24:50,684
The night of your husband's murder.

482
00:24:50,751 --> 00:24:54,050
- You were at the mansion.
- You know about that?

483
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:57,484
- Why'd you lie to us?
- I was ashamed.

484
00:24:57,518 --> 00:25:01,618
- Of what?
- Of why I was there in the first place.

485
00:25:01,651 --> 00:25:04,618
- Why was that?
- She was spying on her husband.

486
00:25:04,651 --> 00:25:07,317
She suspected him of being unfaithful.

487
00:25:07,351 --> 00:25:10,484
Yes. How did you know that?

488
00:25:10,518 --> 00:25:13,451
Because he's been unfaithful before?

489
00:25:15,451 --> 00:25:17,684
Yes.

490
00:25:17,751 --> 00:25:20,150
He had an affair about a year ago.

491
00:25:20,184 --> 00:25:23,818
He was out of town. I was
caught up with my work,

492
00:25:23,851 --> 00:25:26,551
And it happened.

493
00:25:26,618 --> 00:25:28,718
That's very understanding of you.

494
00:25:28,784 --> 00:25:30,718
Oh, I was furious, believe me.

495
00:25:30,784 --> 00:25:34,084
But we worked on it--
counseling and so forth,

496
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:37,050
And I thought I had moved on.

497
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:39,351
But I hadn't.

498
00:25:39,384 --> 00:25:41,317
I didn't trust him.

499
00:25:41,351 --> 00:25:44,117
So when Alan told me he
would be spending this weekend

500
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:46,551
At the mansion and
wouldn't be coming home,

501
00:25:46,618 --> 00:25:50,851
I decided I had to go there
to catch him in the act.

502
00:25:50,885 --> 00:25:52,851
But no one showed up.

503
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:54,484
No.

504
00:25:54,518 --> 00:25:58,451
I felt so awful that I
left without talking to him.

505
00:25:58,518 --> 00:26:02,084
- What time did you leave?
- Around 10:00.

506
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:04,918
Is there any way to prove that?

507
00:26:04,985 --> 00:26:08,050
Um, I bought gas on the way home.

508
00:26:08,084 --> 00:26:11,351
The credit card company will
have a record of that, right?

509
00:26:11,384 --> 00:26:13,718
Yes, we'll verify that.

510
00:26:13,751 --> 00:26:17,651
I can't help thinking
that if I'd stayed there,

511
00:26:17,684 --> 00:26:20,184
If I'd just gone and talked to Alan,

512
00:26:20,217 --> 00:26:22,184
He would still be alive.

513
00:26:22,217 --> 00:26:25,017
Mm, most likely you'd both be dead.

514
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:28,918
With the way that I
feel, I might prefer that.

515
00:26:28,985 --> 00:26:31,551
That feeling will pass.

516
00:26:31,584 --> 00:26:34,317
What do you know about that?

517
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:35,885
Enough.

518
00:26:40,718 --> 00:26:42,131
How you doing, Drew?

519
00:26:42,131 --> 00:26:43,122
Fine. Thank you. Thanks.

520
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,957
Your aunt's gonna be in
with us a little longer.

521
00:26:45,957 --> 00:26:47,474
This fight's gonna take
some sorting out, okay?

522
00:26:48,104 --> 00:26:49,838
I tried to stop it from escalating.

523
00:26:50,032 --> 00:26:51,269
That's why I was there
in the first place,

524
00:26:51,489 --> 00:26:54,287
But the hostility just
kind of caught me off guard.

525
00:26:54,287 --> 00:26:56,396
It'll be up to your aunt
whether or not to press charges,

526
00:26:56,396 --> 00:26:58,399
But you're a lawyer. You know the deal.

527
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,687
I'm not exactly a lawyer.

528
00:26:59,935 --> 00:27:00,839
My aunt likes to exaggerate.

529
00:27:00,872 --> 00:27:02,706
I'm a paralegal.

530
00:27:02,739 --> 00:27:05,039
Cho, uh, I'm sorry. You got a second?

531
00:27:05,073 --> 00:27:08,239
Sure. We're still gonna
need a statement from you.

532
00:27:08,273 --> 00:27:10,806
Excuse me for a second. What's up?

533
00:27:10,872 --> 00:27:12,939
I told Grace I love her.

534
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,472
Wow. Okay. Well done.
Then what happened?

535
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:16,224
Oh, nothing.

536
00:27:16,224 --> 00:27:18,672
Jane interrupted, and she
hasn't said a word since.

537
00:27:18,673 --> 00:27:19,575
So tell her again.

538
00:27:19,575 --> 00:27:23,211
Right, okay. Tell her
again. Okay, right.

539
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,182
Your aura is
fascinating, Mr. Jane--

540
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:32,369
So many hues.

541
00:27:32,946 --> 00:27:33,684
Thank you.

542
00:27:35,405 --> 00:27:37,409
The mansion's uninhabitable.

543
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:38,643
Why would you want it back?

544
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:41,050
Sentimental reasons.

545
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:44,617
Mm, no. No, that's not right.

546
00:27:44,651 --> 00:27:46,950
You're closed, furtive.
You're hiding something.

547
00:27:46,983 --> 00:27:50,317
There's something in
that house, isn't there?

548
00:27:50,351 --> 00:27:52,917
Something you don't want
anyone else to find...

549
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:56,317
- Evidence of your guilt, perhaps.
- That's absurd.

550
00:27:56,351 --> 00:27:58,517
No. You're right. That is absurd.

551
00:27:58,584 --> 00:28:00,950
It's something else entirely.

552
00:28:00,983 --> 00:28:04,850
Ah--the
treasure.

553
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:06,451
What treasure?

554
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:09,551
Walter beckworth's treasure
he hid in the mansion.

555
00:28:09,617 --> 00:28:11,651
I wanted my house back

556
00:28:11,684 --> 00:28:14,150
Because I didn't like
what foster planned for it.

557
00:28:14,184 --> 00:28:17,917
- He was going to destroy it.
- Foster had only been there a few weeks.

558
00:28:17,983 --> 00:28:20,517
How could you have known what
he was gonna do before he did?

559
00:28:20,551 --> 00:28:23,017
In conversation, he told me.

560
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:27,517
Ma'am, we find out you're lying,
you become suspect number one.

561
00:28:31,017 --> 00:28:33,017
All right.

562
00:28:35,217 --> 00:28:38,084
How are you with riddles?

563
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:43,017
I found the clue a few weeks ago

564
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:45,050
When I bought some of beckworth's papers

565
00:28:45,084 --> 00:28:47,417
At an estate sale. It was in a letter

566
00:28:47,484 --> 00:28:50,784
To one of his cousins
just before his death.

567
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:53,950
Beckworth boasts that he's
hidden his "great treasure"

568
00:28:54,017 --> 00:28:56,451
Where no one can find
it, and then he offers

569
00:28:56,517 --> 00:29:00,084
This clue--"if fortune
is what you seek sincere,

570
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:02,950
The only place to look is here."

571
00:29:03,017 --> 00:29:04,850
That's it? That's the riddle?

572
00:29:04,883 --> 00:29:07,351
- Yes.
- Interesting.

573
00:29:07,384 --> 00:29:09,950
Of course, I told mrs. Abner right away,

574
00:29:10,017 --> 00:29:11,298
But the house had already
been sold to foster.

575
00:29:11,298 --> 00:29:12,351
Why didn't you mention this before?

576
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:15,417
Well, it... it didn't seem relevant.

577
00:29:15,484 --> 00:29:17,718
It's motive. It's very relevant.

578
00:29:17,751 --> 00:29:20,784
Mr. Raimey and ms. Abner had
agreed to keep quiet to avoid

579
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:23,751
Having to share the loot
with anyone else, correct?

580
00:29:23,784 --> 00:29:26,751
Yes, but that doesn't mean
either of us killed foster.

581
00:29:26,784 --> 00:29:29,284
Oh, absolutely right.
Whoever killed foster

582
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:32,351
Was simply trying to
scare him from the mansion.

583
00:29:32,384 --> 00:29:34,950
It could have been anyone
that wanted the treasure,

584
00:29:35,017 --> 00:29:38,084
- Even you, deputy fisher.
- That's right. I killed him.

585
00:29:38,117 --> 00:29:41,250
- Did you? You denied it earlier.
- Stop doing that.

586
00:29:41,284 --> 00:29:43,617
I need to see this
clue. Where's the letter?

587
00:29:50,883 --> 00:29:52,484
Thank you.

588
00:29:55,417 --> 00:29:57,217
What?

589
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:01,451
Smells good. "If fortune
is what you seek sincere,

590
00:30:01,484 --> 00:30:06,351
The only place to look is... hear."

591
00:30:06,417 --> 00:30:08,917
"Hear"--

592
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:11,351
It's spelled
h-e-a-r.

593
00:30:11,417 --> 00:30:14,284
Well, I assumed it was a mistake.

594
00:30:14,317 --> 00:30:17,017
Hmm. There are no mistakes.

595
00:30:17,084 --> 00:30:19,751
Let's go.

596
00:30:37,617 --> 00:30:40,718
As you know, walter
beckworth left a coded message

597
00:30:40,784 --> 00:30:43,551
Describing the location of his treasure.

598
00:30:43,617 --> 00:30:46,317
I brought you all here
to help me find it.

599
00:30:46,351 --> 00:30:50,684
The word "here" is
misspelled in the riddle.

600
00:30:50,751 --> 00:30:53,150
I don't believe that's a mistake.

601
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:56,150
I think that the clue itself

602
00:30:56,184 --> 00:30:58,150
Lies in
that word--

603
00:30:58,184 --> 00:31:03,351
"hear"--h-e-a-r.

604
00:31:03,384 --> 00:31:07,883
What comes to mind when
I say the word "hear"?

605
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:10,751
Noise.

606
00:31:10,818 --> 00:31:12,684
Sounds.

607
00:31:12,718 --> 00:31:16,417
Ears. Very good. What else?

608
00:31:16,484 --> 00:31:18,917
Music. Musical instruments.

609
00:31:18,983 --> 00:31:22,551
Definite possibility.

610
00:31:25,284 --> 00:31:27,351
Cho?

611
00:31:32,517 --> 00:31:34,517
Unveil it.

612
00:32:03,517 --> 00:32:05,551
Hmm.

613
00:32:05,584 --> 00:32:07,818
Aha.

614
00:32:07,883 --> 00:32:09,050
What is it?

615
00:32:09,084 --> 00:32:10,883
Yeah, what is it?

616
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,074
Beckworth's fortune

617
00:32:37,405 --> 00:32:39,771
- There's nothing in it.
- It's empty?

618
00:32:39,805 --> 00:32:41,472
Wait.

619
00:32:49,105 --> 00:32:51,038
What is that?

620
00:32:51,105 --> 00:32:52,771
It's another riddle.

621
00:32:52,805 --> 00:32:54,539
What does it say?

622
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:57,472
"To find fortune and riches,
one doesn't need help.

623
00:32:57,505 --> 00:33:01,005
All one must do is look to oneself."

624
00:33:04,938 --> 00:33:07,706
What does it mean?

625
00:33:07,771 --> 00:33:10,005
I don't know, but
it's spelled correctly.

626
00:33:10,072 --> 00:33:12,172
It means we're wasting our time.

627
00:33:12,205 --> 00:33:15,472
- It doesn't even make any sense.
- Let's not rush to judgment.

628
00:33:15,505 --> 00:33:18,005
Beckworth probably put it
there as a practical joke.

629
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:21,138
- Pretty lame joke.
- But the fortune could still be here.

630
00:33:21,172 --> 00:33:24,239
- I just need time to find it.
- We're not gonna waste any more time.

631
00:33:24,305 --> 00:33:26,005
I'm shutting this down. Everybody out.

632
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:28,905
Cho, secure the place and set the alarm.

633
00:33:28,972 --> 00:33:31,706
Have rigsby and van pelt set
up on the mansion tonight.

634
00:33:31,771 --> 00:33:33,706
We'll take the shift after them.

635
00:33:33,771 --> 00:33:35,771
Nobody gets in this place,
especially jane. Understood?

636
00:33:35,771 --> 00:33:37,190
Got it.

637
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:38,072
Everybody out.

638
00:33:38,138 --> 00:33:41,639
- Lisbon. Lisbon. I--you--lisbon, this
- bite me. We're done for the night.

639
00:33:49,305 --> 00:33:51,072
"Bite me"?

640
00:33:51,138 --> 00:33:54,339
- It's too much?
- Uh, a smidge.

641
00:33:56,738 --> 00:33:58,339
Worked.

642
00:33:58,372 --> 00:34:02,038
It's fine, just a
little over-the-top.

643
00:34:23,005 --> 00:34:24,938
- So, uh, grace...
- yes?

644
00:34:25,005 --> 00:34:27,972
- I was wondering if we could do...
- how do you want to handle this?

645
00:34:28,038 --> 00:34:29,138
Handle what?

646
00:34:29,205 --> 00:34:31,439
The stakeout.

647
00:34:31,505 --> 00:34:34,205
Oh. Um, right.

648
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,472
Listen, about the other thing,

649
00:34:41,005 --> 00:34:43,539
Maybe it's not the right time.

650
00:34:43,572 --> 00:34:45,871
Yeah. Yeah.

651
00:34:45,905 --> 00:34:49,472
Um, we could, uh, walk...

652
00:34:49,539 --> 00:34:51,405
Patrol the grounds.

653
00:34:51,439 --> 00:34:55,239
Or maybe one of us could stay here

654
00:34:55,272 --> 00:34:57,838
While the other one
patrols-- alternate?

655
00:34:57,905 --> 00:35:00,472
Yep, that's better.
I'll, uh, I'll go first.

656
00:35:00,539 --> 00:35:02,541
Oh, that's okay. I can do it.

657
00:35:02,541 --> 00:35:03,863
I'm easy.

658
00:35:04,563 --> 00:35:06,959
Well, if you want to go
first, that's fine also.

659
00:35:06,959 --> 00:35:10,110
No, no, no.

660
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:44,305
"Look to oneself."

661
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:04,372
No!

662
00:36:04,439 --> 00:36:07,138
Nothing there, Drew. Never was.

663
00:36:07,172 --> 00:36:10,305
You planted the second clue?

664
00:36:10,339 --> 00:36:12,505
Aha. Yes.

665
00:36:12,539 --> 00:36:15,639
I didn't kill Foster.

666
00:36:15,672 --> 00:36:17,639
Don't be ridiculous. Of course you did.

667
00:36:17,713 --> 00:36:19,023
Only the killer knew how to get in here

668
00:36:19,023 --> 00:36:21,033
Via the secret passageway.

669
00:36:21,033 --> 00:36:23,172
You proved your guilt just
by walking in the room.

670
00:36:23,205 --> 00:36:27,005
Was it all just for the money?

671
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:33,572
Just for the money?

672
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:38,205
I spent years listening
to my family go on

673
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:42,572
About the Beckworths and
everything that they had.

674
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:44,672
I didn't get any of it,

675
00:36:44,706 --> 00:36:46,672
Not one thing.

676
00:36:46,706 --> 00:36:50,272
And then my aunt told me about
the clue and the treasure,

677
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:53,339
And I thought I could
get that for myself.

678
00:36:53,372 --> 00:36:58,205
I could have what I've
deserved all my life.

679
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:01,572
All I had to do was get
Foster out of the house.

680
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:03,505
So you haunted him.

681
00:37:03,539 --> 00:37:07,905
My cousin told me
about the, uh, equipment

682
00:37:07,938 --> 00:37:09,905
Beckworth had built in.

683
00:37:09,938 --> 00:37:12,606
I just wanted to scare him.

684
00:37:12,672 --> 00:37:17,005
But Foster wouldn't take the hint.

685
00:37:17,038 --> 00:37:21,539
So I had to do something.

686
00:37:44,205 --> 00:37:46,871
I didn't mean to kill him.

687
00:37:51,871 --> 00:37:54,771
Oh, I didn't know what to do.

688
00:37:54,805 --> 00:37:59,405
And then, uh, I remembered
the stories about Beckworth,

689
00:37:59,439 --> 00:38:03,805
How he was killed, how his
ghost still haunts this place.

690
00:38:03,871 --> 00:38:05,805
So I threw him out the window

691
00:38:05,871 --> 00:38:07,472
The same way Beckworth was killed.

692
00:38:07,539 --> 00:38:12,539
It wasn't Foster's house.
It belonged to my family.

693
00:38:12,606 --> 00:38:15,305
Put your hands behind your back.

694
00:38:15,339 --> 00:38:17,339
Now.

695
00:38:22,405 --> 00:38:24,805
When you first opened
the box under the piano,

696
00:38:24,838 --> 00:38:26,805
Was there anything in it?

697
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:31,038
This.

698
00:38:31,105 --> 00:38:34,539
You killed Foster for an old key.

699
00:38:34,606 --> 00:38:37,539
I wonder what it opens.

700
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:40,439
- Oh, I know what it opens.
- What?

701
00:38:43,339 --> 00:38:46,672
He's just messing with
you. He's mean like that.

702
00:38:46,706 --> 00:38:48,871
Come on.

703
00:38:55,672 --> 00:39:00,472
Mr. Jane. I was just being
briefed by one of your agents.

704
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:02,472
Well, I hope they conducted themselves

705
00:39:02,505 --> 00:39:04,905
In a professional manner.

706
00:39:04,972 --> 00:39:07,639
Thank you for everything.

707
00:39:07,672 --> 00:39:11,072
Well, my pleasure.

708
00:39:11,138 --> 00:39:13,539
Do you mind a question?

709
00:39:13,606 --> 00:39:16,639
Uh, no.

710
00:39:18,706 --> 00:39:20,706
I asked about you.

711
00:39:20,738 --> 00:39:25,205
What happened to your
family-- I'm very sorry.

712
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:28,972
And I thought maybe
it means you understand

713
00:39:29,005 --> 00:39:30,938
How it feels to lose somebody.

714
00:39:31,005 --> 00:39:33,205
Was that your question?

715
00:39:35,305 --> 00:39:38,706
Do you think they know how we feel?

716
00:39:38,738 --> 00:39:41,771
The dead, I mean...

717
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:45,439
How sorry we are...

718
00:39:45,505 --> 00:39:48,672
How we wish things could be different?

719
00:39:48,706 --> 00:39:52,038
Do you think they understand?

720
00:39:57,738 --> 00:39:59,072
No.

721
00:40:02,871 --> 00:40:04,205
Sorry.

722
00:40:14,572 --> 00:40:16,572
Case closed pizza?

723
00:40:16,606 --> 00:40:18,223
Case closed pizza.

724
00:40:18,223 --> 00:40:20,706
Rigsby eats all the sausage
again, I'll be pissed.

725
00:40:22,055 --> 00:40:22,967
Are you okay?

726
00:40:23,208 --> 00:40:24,567
Right as rain.

727
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:27,774
Oh, I have the perfect
thing to go with this.

728
00:40:36,108 --> 00:40:38,174
Wine?

729
00:40:38,241 --> 00:40:41,007
Just a little something special.

730
00:40:45,807 --> 00:40:49,074
Excuse me. I need a glass. Sorry.

731
00:40:49,108 --> 00:40:51,141
Sure.

732
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:28,141
I'm gonna leave in a few minutes.

733
00:41:28,174 --> 00:41:30,141
Wait five, then meet me at my car.

734
00:41:30,208 --> 00:41:32,041
Okay.

735
00:41:32,108 --> 00:41:34,141
Okay.

736
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,640
Just a little.

737
00:41:48,508 --> 00:41:50,141
Please.

738
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:51,607
Oh, thanks.

739
00:41:51,674 --> 00:41:53,274
Mr. Rigsby.

740
00:41:53,341 --> 00:41:56,941
Cheers.

741
00:41:57,007 --> 00:41:58,508
Case closed.

742
00:41:58,541 --> 00:42:00,607
Case closed.

743
00:42:00,674 --> 00:42:03,623
- Mmm. It's nice.
- Glad you like it.

744
00:42:03,623 --> 00:42:04,702
So what was the key to, Jane?

745
00:42:04,703 --> 00:42:05,474
The one you found in the box.

746
00:42:05,886 --> 00:42:07,266
The key? Beckworth's fortune.

747
00:42:07,266 --> 00:42:09,153
Give it up.

748
00:42:09,153 --> 00:42:11,551
Well, just because the
fortune wasn't gold or cash

749
00:42:11,551 --> 00:42:14,962
- Doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
- So what was it?

750
00:42:15,304 --> 00:42:16,667
Beckworth was a collector.

751
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:19,026
He collected hundreds of one thing...

752
00:42:19,127 --> 00:42:21,411
Some of the finest, rarest
examples in the world

753
00:42:21,411 --> 00:42:24,575
- worth tens of millions of dollars.
- So what was it?

754
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:26,255
What?

755
00:42:26,255 --> 00:42:26,899
Smells good.

756
00:42:37,408 --> 00:42:39,408
Cheers.
