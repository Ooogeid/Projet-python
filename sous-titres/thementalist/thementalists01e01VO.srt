1
00:00:09,428 --> 00:00:11,264
Excuse me.
Can I get a comment, please?

2
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:28,053
- Captain.
- Agent Lisbon.

3
00:00:28,554 --> 00:00:31,229
Don't think we'll be needing you guys.
We like the neighbor kid

4
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:33,303
- who found the body.
- Did he confess?

5
00:00:34,051 --> 00:00:35,496
He's a real squirrel.

6
00:00:35,657 --> 00:00:36,794
Did you kill her?

7
00:00:44,123 --> 00:00:46,424
<i>Mercy's father would like
to give a brief statement.</i>

8
00:00:47,692 --> 00:00:51,012
<i>I just want to take a moment
and thank everyone in law enforcement</i>

9
00:00:51,172 --> 00:00:52,555
<i>and all the volunteers</i>

10
00:00:53,062 --> 00:00:55,558
<i>who helped us in the search
for our beloved daughter.</i>

11
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:02,148
<i>The way that this entire community
has come together to support me</i>

12
00:01:03,318 --> 00:01:07,179
<i>and Juniper in this terrible time
has been a great comfort to us.</i>

13
00:01:10,877 --> 00:01:12,701
<i>And now I would just like to ask you...</i>

14
00:01:14,257 --> 00:01:15,864
<i>You give us some time,</i>

15
00:01:15,984 --> 00:01:19,057
<i>space and privacy

16
00:01:19,302 --> 00:01:20,318

18
00:02:38,677 --> 00:02:40,097
Hello, Mrs. Tolliver.

19
00:02:41,179 --> 00:02:42,122
Who are you?

20
00:02:43,007 --> 00:02:44,290
My name is Patrick Jane.

21
00:02:45,503 --> 00:02:46,798
I'm here to help you.

22
00:02:48,461 --> 00:02:49,923
Would you like a cup of tea?

23
00:02:52,927 --> 00:02:54,515
Yes, I would, thank you.

24
00:02:58,179 --> 00:02:59,333
You must be tired.

25
00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:02,317
Why don't you sit down?

26
00:03:04,677 --> 00:03:06,577
It's nice and quiet in here, isn't it?

27
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,519
Quiet, soothing, calm.

28
00:03:12,991 --> 00:03:13,991
Calm.

29
00:03:21,575 --> 00:03:23,372
I've been watching you and your husband,

30
00:03:23,492 --> 00:03:26,376
and I want you to know that I understand
what you're feeling right now.

31
00:03:30,054 --> 00:03:31,602
You have no idea.

32
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:34,989
Believe me.

33
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,660
I do.

34
00:03:37,177 --> 00:03:38,177
I know.

35
00:03:39,526 --> 00:03:42,154
- I know, and I wanna help you.
- You can't help me.

36
00:03:44,052 --> 00:03:45,252
What do you know?

37
00:03:45,964 --> 00:03:47,208
All sorts of things.

38
00:03:49,149 --> 00:03:51,192
You really only pretend
to like skiing, right?

39
00:03:53,403 --> 00:03:56,239
You're pleased that your best friend
recently gained some weight...

40
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,490
About 10 pounds.

41
00:03:57,942 --> 00:04:00,379
You wish you'd been more adventurous
when you were younger.

42
00:04:00,499 --> 00:04:02,488
You love India,
but you've never been there.

43
00:04:02,608 --> 00:04:05,342
You have trouble sleeping.
Your favorite color...

44
00:04:07,424 --> 00:04:08,334
is blue.

45
00:04:10,179 --> 00:04:12,501
I don't understand.
You're...

46
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,091
You're psychic?

47
00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:18,720
Just paying attention.

48
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:22,852
I used to make a good living
pretending to be a psychic.

49
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,711
I tell you this

50
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:29,644
because I want you to understand
there's no point hiding things from me.

51
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,125
Hiding... What?

52
00:04:34,896 --> 00:04:36,894
Know what I see
when I look at your husband?

53
00:04:38,393 --> 00:04:39,625
I see a warm,

54
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:42,038
loving, generous man.

55
00:04:42,426 --> 00:04:45,618
A little vain, maybe.
Selfish, controlling...

56
00:04:45,907 --> 00:04:47,244
But a decent man.

57
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:54,088
{\So w}Why do you suspect him
of murdering your daughter?

58
00:04:58,990 --> 00:04:59,990
I don't.

59
00:05:02,614 --> 00:05:04,109
The McCluskey boy did it.

60
00:05:04,884 --> 00:05:06,309
That's what the police say.

61
00:05:07,309 --> 00:05:09,079
But you think they're wrong.

62
00:05:09,394 --> 00:05:10,229
Why?

63
00:05:11,028 --> 00:05:12,209
I don't know.

64
00:05:15,117 --> 00:05:16,145
Tell me.

65
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:21,241
Last year, they have been so strange
with each other.

66
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,578
And neither one would admit{\ that}
anything was wrong, and I think that...

67
00:05:28,425 --> 00:05:30,884
I think that she tried to tell me once,
and I didn't...

68
00:05:38,516 --> 00:05:40,176
Did you ask him if he killed her?

69
00:05:42,123 --> 00:05:43,369
What would he say?

70
00:05:43,673 --> 00:05:45,807
Most wives can tell
when their husbands are lying.

71
00:05:52,849 --> 00:05:55,354
I don't want tea.
The McCluskey boy did it.

72
00:05:55,935 --> 00:05:56,935
Maybe.

73
00:06:02,422 --> 00:06:03,806
You think he did it, too?

74
00:06:05,564 --> 00:06:07,245
I trust a mother's instinct.

75
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,432
There you are.

76
00:06:15,943 --> 00:06:17,162
Hi. Who are you?

77
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:21,175
I'm the police.
Did you kill your daughter?

78
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:27,751
How dare you?

79
00:06:28,217 --> 00:06:31,215
I asked you a simple question, sir.
Did you kill your daughter?

80
00:06:34,175 --> 00:06:36,399
I did not kill my daughter!

81
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:39,136
Now you get the hell out of my house!

82
00:06:42,815 --> 00:06:44,365
What's the matter with you?

83
00:06:47,464 --> 00:06:50,499
- I'm gonna have your badge.
- An innocent man would have punched me{\ by now}.

84
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,801
I am gonna make life miserable for you.

85
00:06:54,169 --> 00:06:56,661
You come in here,
you accost my wife,

86
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,588
you cause trouble on...

87
00:07:13,804 --> 00:07:15,646
Honestly, it's not as bad as it looks.

88
00:07:19,685 --> 00:07:20,782
Mrs. Tolliver?

89
00:07:22,552 --> 00:07:23,642
Please wait.

90
00:07:24,266 --> 00:07:25,498
Front room's clear!

91
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,801
Then the son of a bitch eagles 17.

92
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:53,678
- Are you kiddin' me?
- On that course?

93
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:57,480
- A damn eagle?
- That course never suited you, Price.

94
00:07:58,263 --> 00:08:01,054
- We'll do better in Orlando.
- We have a nice spot on the draw.

95
00:08:01,644 --> 00:08:05,037
I'll tell you what.
Davis Love III can kiss my butt.

96
00:08:17,075 --> 00:08:18,075
Alison?

97
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:35,145
<i>Flight 233 from Sacramento,</i>

98
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:37,821
<i>you may claim your baggage
from Carousel 2.</i>

99
00:08:41,147 --> 00:08:42,163
Sorry.

100
00:08:43,227 --> 00:08:45,570
You checked luggage?
What are you, on vacation?

101
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:46,880
Won't do it again.

102
00:08:47,064 --> 00:08:49,524
When your <i>trousseau</i> arrives,
pick up the second rental,

103
00:08:49,692 --> 00:08:52,717
go direct to the sheriff's department,
hustle us up a couple of rooms,

104
00:08:52,945 --> 00:08:54,871
- furniture and phone lines.
- Yes. Ma'am.

105
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,008
Come on.

106
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:07,980
Morning, everybody.

107
00:09:08,711 --> 00:09:11,971
- How was your flight?
- Go away. You're on suspension.

108
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:13,802
Thank you.

109
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,494
Mandated leave.

110
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:18,932
- Ends next week.
- So come back next week.

111
00:09:19,481 --> 00:09:22,198
- Hot enough for you?
- Which one of you jackasses told him?

112
00:09:22,738 --> 00:09:25,309
- It was you, wasn't it, Cho?
- Of course he called me.

113
00:09:25,429 --> 00:09:27,559
It's Red John.
You can't keep me out of this.

114
00:09:27,952 --> 00:09:30,064
- Why would you want to?
- You got a man killed.

115
00:09:30,184 --> 00:09:32,640
- There's consequences.
- A man that murdered his daughter

116
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,552
'cause she wouldn't have sex
with him{\ anymore}?

117
00:09:34,672 --> 00:09:37,716
You did not know that.
If she hadn't had left a diary...

118
00:09:37,836 --> 00:09:40,791
But she did, though.
Be reasonable. This is my case.

119
00:09:40,951 --> 00:09:43,211
- Your case?
- Red John's mine.

120
00:09:43,511 --> 00:09:45,296
Red John doesn't belong to anyone.

121
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:49,467
He belongs to me.

122
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,131
It's not my call. Rules are rules.
Come back next week.

123
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,816
Don't let this man past.

124
00:10:05,117 --> 00:10:06,117
Boss?

125
00:10:06,977 --> 00:10:08,354
We have Gregory Tannen...

126
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:11,057
Caucasian, male, 43, single.

127
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:12,615
We haven't opened him up yet,

128
00:10:12,735 --> 00:10:14,492
- but...
- Sorry I went over your head.

129
00:10:15,176 --> 00:10:16,948
I'll redeem myself, I promise.

130
00:10:17,364 --> 00:10:19,181
You want redemption?
Be silent.

131
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:20,903
I can learn to do that.

132
00:10:23,425 --> 00:10:24,425
Sorry.

133
00:10:27,268 --> 00:10:30,192
The burn marks here indicate
that the victim was subdued

134
00:10:30,312 --> 00:10:32,802
with a stun gun... Standard
civilian model by the look of it.

135
00:10:33,749 --> 00:10:35,835
Death appears to be caused
by several blows

136
00:10:35,955 --> 00:10:39,267
to the back of the skull consistent with
a bloodied golf club found at the scene.

137
00:10:40,286 --> 00:10:43,104
Female is Alison Randolph...

138
00:10:43,264 --> 00:10:45,307
27, married, no children.

139
00:10:45,573 --> 00:10:49,243
They were found at her listed residence.
TOD: looks to be early saturday evening.

140
00:10:49,497 --> 00:10:51,425
On Alison,
we have the same stun gun marks,

141
00:10:51,545 --> 00:10:54,420
followed by binding
with tight black plastic ligatures,

142
00:10:54,608 --> 00:10:56,997
frenzied cutting
and stabbing assault of the torso

143
00:10:57,117 --> 00:10:59,662
- and subsequent abuse of the viscera.
- Textbook Red John.

144
00:10:59,822 --> 00:11:01,580
- Who found the{\ *bodies}m?
- This one's husband,

145
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,863
coming home from the airport
{\Sunday morning }with his brother.

146
00:11:03,983 --> 00:11:05,418
- {\He's a}A pro golfer.
- Yeah?

147
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:06,649
Price Randolph.

148
00:11:07,071 --> 00:11:08,713
What's her deal with him?
{\Do w}We know?

149
00:11:09,145 --> 00:11:11,802
- He's on file as one of her physicians.
- Making a house call?

150
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:14,265
- Lovers?
- No, this one's gay.

151
00:11:17,363 --> 00:11:19,863
Dr. Wagner might know
what their relationship was.

152
00:11:20,092 --> 00:11:21,558
He's here to make the formal id?

153
00:11:25,862 --> 00:11:26,914
Dr. Wagner.

154
00:11:29,435 --> 00:11:32,676
I'm Agent Teresa Lisbon,
California Bureau of Investigation.

155
00:11:33,189 --> 00:11:35,698
- What's your connection to the victims?
- I work with {\Gregory}him...

156
00:11:36,451 --> 00:11:40,400
Dr. Tannen and the Randolph family
are longtime clients of our practice.

157
00:11:40,946 --> 00:11:42,837
Are house calls the norm
at your practice?

158
00:11:43,866 --> 00:11:46,667
- Gregory and Alison were close friends.
- Lovers?

159
00:11:46,983 --> 00:11:48,502
No. He was gay.

160
00:11:49,113 --> 00:11:51,088
No, they were just...
Friends.

161
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:55,092
- What in God's name happened to them?
- Looks like Red John.

162
00:11:57,087 --> 00:11:59,680
- Who's Red John?
- We don't know who did this.

163
00:12:00,883 --> 00:12:03,490
We'll be in touch probably.
Thank you.

164
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,046
Red John enters here.

165
00:12:14,897 --> 00:12:15,897
Excuse me.

166
00:12:17,165 --> 00:12:18,613
He comes around here.

167
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:21,295
He waits for her,

168
00:12:21,904 --> 00:12:23,606
expecting her to come in alone.

169
00:12:24,073 --> 00:12:26,752
Only thing, her friend Tannen
chose the wrong night

170
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:29,460
to come over for a Richard Gere
and ice cream orgy.

171
00:12:30,909 --> 00:12:34,337
So Red John zaps 'em both
with his trusty stun gun, and...

172
00:12:35,902 --> 00:12:36,902
Excuse me.

173
00:12:37,483 --> 00:12:40,289
Grabs a 5-iron from the bag here and...

174
00:12:44,935 --> 00:12:46,268
Crushes Tannen's skull.

175
00:12:47,176 --> 00:12:50,447
Then he takes his sweet time dealing
with Alison how he likes.

176
00:12:51,254 --> 00:12:54,178
She's a nice big girl,
so unless he's pretty strong,

177
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:57,031
I'm guessing that he grabbed her
by the arms and...

178
00:13:36,587 --> 00:13:39,978
He says he's sorry for all the pain
he's caused you and your mother.

179
00:13:42,237 --> 00:13:43,237
Deeply sorry.

180
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,332
He asks you to forgive him.

181
00:13:47,997 --> 00:13:49,420
Can you do that, Jenny?

182
00:13:51,611 --> 00:13:53,794
- He needs to hear it.
- I forgive you, Daddy.

183
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:56,226
Daddy, I forgive you.

184
00:13:56,944 --> 00:13:58,089
He's smiling now.

185
00:13:59,486 --> 00:14:00,843
They're tears of joy.

186
00:14:03,215 --> 00:14:05,306
He says, "God bless you
and keep you."

187
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,438
He's gone.

188
00:14:24,115 --> 00:14:25,220
Amazing.

189
00:14:26,862 --> 00:14:28,454
She's... Amazed.

190
00:14:30,735 --> 00:14:32,333
- Patrick...
- One second.

191
00:14:32,883 --> 00:14:35,611
- Give him some time.
- Absolu... Come on back to us.

192
00:14:35,731 --> 00:14:37,517
- I'm back. Thank you.
- Back.

193
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,966
Patrick, I understand
that you're also sort of

194
00:14:42,128 --> 00:14:45,275
a paranormal detective.
Is that right?

195
00:14:45,891 --> 00:14:47,681
I try to help the police when I can.

196
00:14:48,312 --> 00:14:50,627
And you're helping them hunt this...

197
00:14:51,178 --> 00:14:53,241
scary serial killer.
What's his name?

198
00:14:53,847 --> 00:14:55,814
- Red John.
- There she blows...

199
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,506
Classic Red John smiley face.

200
00:14:59,675 --> 00:15:01,710
Drawn in the victims' blood,

201
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,545
clockwise with three fingers
of his right hand,

202
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:08,056
wearing a rubber kitchen glove.

203
00:15:08,851 --> 00:15:10,997
I'm stoked to finally see one
in the flesh.

204
00:15:11,281 --> 00:15:12,635
This isn't Red John.

205
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,833
Right.

206
00:15:15,869 --> 00:15:18,691
Red John thinks of himself
as a showman, an artist.

207
00:15:18,811 --> 00:15:20,548
He has a strong sense of theater.

208
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:23,967
In all the previous killings, he made
sure the first thing that anyone sees

209
00:15:24,446 --> 00:15:25,761
is the face on the wall.

210
00:15:26,831 --> 00:15:28,992
You see the face first, and you know...

211
00:15:29,215 --> 00:15:31,362
You know what's happened,
and you feel dread.

212
00:15:31,927 --> 00:15:34,228
Then and only then
you see the body of the victim...

213
00:15:34,773 --> 00:15:36,157
Always in that order.

214
00:15:36,473 --> 00:15:39,537
Here it's the opposite.
The first thing you see

215
00:15:40,018 --> 00:15:42,570
is the body,
and you have to look around

216
00:15:42,732 --> 00:15:44,154
to see the face on the wall.

217
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:48,982
- Doesn't play nearly as well, does it?
- Depends on your taste, I suppose.

218
00:15:49,775 --> 00:15:52,371
The killer could have painted
on the correct wall here,

219
00:15:52,531 --> 00:15:55,535
but he didn't because he didn't know
better because he isn't Red John.

220
00:15:58,328 --> 00:15:59,463
Interesting.

221
00:16:01,999 --> 00:16:03,465
You know what your problem{\ is, my friend}?

222
00:16:04,585 --> 00:16:07,011
You enjoy your work a little too much.
You're a ghoul.

223
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:11,639
If you don't get horny reading <i>Fangoria</i>,
I'm Britney Spears.

224
00:16:12,631 --> 00:16:13,641
I resent that.

225
00:16:13,802 --> 00:16:15,644
This is you trying to redeem yourself, is it?

226
00:16:15,805 --> 00:16:16,805
I'm sorry.

227
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:19,189
He irks me.

228
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:21,442
He's irksome.

229
00:16:23,614 --> 00:16:25,264
You don't need me here.

230
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:42,046
- This one doesn't fit the pattern.
- So Jane was right. We have a copycat.

231
00:16:42,206 --> 00:16:44,089
Or we have Red John trying new things,

232
00:16:44,425 --> 00:16:46,644
or we have Red John making a mistake.
We don't know.

233
00:16:47,035 --> 00:16:48,885
We'll work the evidence
until we do know.

234
00:16:50,005 --> 00:16:52,096
- Go talk to the husband.
- Will do, boss.

235
00:16:57,513 --> 00:16:58,963
What are you waitin' for?

236
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:24,160
So you might be right about this case.
Might be.

237
00:17:24,331 --> 00:17:25,736
Thanks for the insight.

238
00:17:27,754 --> 00:17:28,836
Did I say that?

239
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:32,243
I'm acknowledging the fact
that you might be right, that's all.

240
00:17:32,669 --> 00:17:35,475
I mean, if you wanted to come back,
I couldn't stop you.

241
00:17:37,825 --> 00:17:39,890
Fine.
I'm asking you to come back.

242
00:17:42,533 --> 00:17:43,533
Because.

243
00:17:44,235 --> 00:17:46,178
Because you're useful to the team.

244
00:17:48,653 --> 00:17:50,489
I won't say "Please".
Go screw yourself.

245
00:17:51,775 --> 00:17:52,775
Jackass.

246
00:18:02,905 --> 00:18:03,905
Good morning.

247
00:18:04,454 --> 00:18:05,610
Can I help you?

248
00:18:07,499 --> 00:18:08,882
You must be Van Pelt.

249
00:18:09,593 --> 00:18:10,926
Pleasure. Patrick Jane.

250
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,716
Hi. Good to meet you.

251
00:18:12,843 --> 00:18:15,610
- Agent Cho said you had left town.
- No. Nowhere to go.

252
00:18:18,907 --> 00:18:21,294
Do you want that desk over there
or this one?

253
00:18:21,966 --> 00:18:24,189
- I mean, that one gets more light.
- That one.

254
00:18:24,611 --> 00:18:25,899
More light by all means.

255
00:18:28,395 --> 00:18:30,881
Very pleasant addition
to the serious crimes family.

256
00:18:31,913 --> 00:18:33,365
When did you get here?

257
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:35,571
<i>Stop. I give up.</i>

258
00:18:37,081 --> 00:18:40,096
<i>Stop. Please, stop.
Turn off the camera.</i>

259
00:18:40,216 --> 00:18:43,250
<i>- Come on, come on, that's enough.
- Okay, we're done.</i>

260
00:18:43,841 --> 00:18:45,544
<i>You are just awful!</i>

261
00:18:54,462 --> 00:18:56,388
I lost a beautiful, precious angel.

262
00:18:59,123 --> 00:19:00,123
Yes, sir.

263
00:19:00,878 --> 00:19:02,211
Good-looking woman.

264
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:09,911
I'm jumping right in if you don't mind.
You missed the tournament cut on Friday.

265
00:19:10,155 --> 00:19:12,946
But you didn't come home until Sunday.
What did you do{\ with the rest of your time} in Fresno?

266
00:19:13,982 --> 00:19:16,159
I get this.
You guys can't catch the real killer,

267
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:18,674
- so you wanna lay this one on me?
- No, sir.

268
00:19:18,794 --> 00:19:22,456
If we have that confirmation{\ of where you were}, it lets us
exclude you from the investigation.

269
00:19:32,992 --> 00:19:34,510
I was with a massage therapist.

270
00:19:35,866 --> 00:19:36,866
Name?

271
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,221
It had "lady"

272
00:19:41,426 --> 00:19:44,311
- in there somewhere.
- It'll be on his credit card bill.

273
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:45,816
There you go.

274
00:19:46,473 --> 00:19:48,223
Pleasure meeting you boys.

275
00:19:51,341 --> 00:19:53,910
We're a full-service private practice.

276
00:19:55,015 --> 00:19:56,860
We deliver primary care, 

277
00:19:57,199 --> 00:19:58,612
cosmetic surgery,

278
00:19:58,977 --> 00:20:01,662
psychotherapy, sports medicine...
You name it.

279
00:20:01,823 --> 00:20:03,329
What's the african connection?

280
00:20:03,841 --> 00:20:05,624
It's what this place is all about.

281
00:20:05,784 --> 00:20:09,068
Half our profits go to build
and staff basic health clinics

282
00:20:09,188 --> 00:20:10,712
in poor african communities.

283
00:20:12,091 --> 00:20:13,091
Here we are.

284
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:16,968
It's a thin file.

285
00:20:18,124 --> 00:20:20,067
Alison was a healthy young woman.

286
00:20:21,133 --> 00:20:23,527
- Psychiatric history?
- She didn't have one.

287
00:20:24,553 --> 00:20:27,619
STDs? Abortions?
Unexplained injuries?

288
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:32,167
Except for some routine checkups
with me, it's all Dr. Tannen...

289
00:20:32,287 --> 00:20:34,778
- All aesthetic work.
- Did Tannen keep a diary?

290
00:20:35,215 --> 00:20:38,234
Our last case was solved
because the victim kept a diary.

291
00:20:39,141 --> 00:20:40,701
Diary? I don't think so.

292
00:20:41,123 --> 00:20:42,786
Getting back to Alison Randolph...

293
00:20:43,904 --> 00:20:45,705
How was her marriage, do you think?

294
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:48,000
Happy? Unhappy?

295
00:20:49,092 --> 00:20:52,482
About six months ago,
Dr. Tannen asked my advice.

296
00:20:54,301 --> 00:20:58,051
{\Alison had}She asked him to get her a year' supply
of birth control pills off the books,

297
00:20:58,212 --> 00:21:00,290
which is strictly against AMA code.

298
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:03,224
I said sure, do it.

299
00:21:05,082 --> 00:21:08,333
Better us than some Tijuana drugstore.

300
00:21:08,722 --> 00:21:09,938
Why the secrecy?

301
00:21:10,904 --> 00:21:12,608
Price Randolph had a vasectomy,

302
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,419
April of '02.

303
00:21:16,104 --> 00:21:19,218
- If there's anything else I can do...
- I appreciate that.

304
00:21:21,691 --> 00:21:23,100
Actually, there is.

305
00:21:23,776 --> 00:21:25,591
I'm out of sleeping pills.

306
00:21:26,156 --> 00:21:28,498
Can you fix me up?
Anything strong will do.

307
00:21:28,967 --> 00:21:32,492
Sure. Come in for a consultation.
We'll squeeze you in this afternoon.

308
00:21:33,235 --> 00:21:35,129
I was hoping to get something now.

309
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,090
Trying to avoid the chitchat.

310
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,230
I'm sorry.

311
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:43,472
I wouldn't feel comfortable prescribing
without some sort of "chitchat."

312
00:21:43,993 --> 00:21:45,264
I understand.
No problem.

313
00:21:46,802 --> 00:21:47,831
I'll call you...

314
00:21:48,345 --> 00:21:49,185
Maybe.

315
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,514
I like the husband for it.

316
00:21:53,634 --> 00:21:56,027
He hires some hooker{\ he knows}
to create an alibi, flies home,

317
00:21:56,147 --> 00:21:57,963
fillets the spouse,
flies back again.

318
00:21:58,204 --> 00:22:01,239
The classic elaborate and clever
but ultimately stupid plan.

319
00:22:01,399 --> 00:22:03,240
Have you looked
at his PGA tournament record?

320
00:22:03,403 --> 00:22:05,278
It's not bad. 6 mil career earnings.

321
00:22:06,154 --> 00:22:08,891
For coming in second and third.
You put him on the 18th tee

322
00:22:09,011 --> 00:22:12,292
with a big one on the line,
like night follows day, he'll shank it.

323
00:22:12,476 --> 00:22:15,879
He's a choker. He doesn't have the nerve
to kill his wife. Didn't do it.

324
00:22:17,082 --> 00:22:20,843
Should{\Are you suggesting} we drop a prime suspect
because he's never won a major?

325
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:23,470
I'm just making idle conversation.

326
00:22:25,902 --> 00:22:27,081
How'd you do that?

327
00:22:28,487 --> 00:22:29,592
Telekinesis.

328
00:22:30,428 --> 00:22:31,428
He blew on it.

329
00:22:33,473 --> 00:22:35,015
That is another way to do it.

330
00:22:37,152 --> 00:22:39,279
Mr. Jane, I have a question

331
00:22:39,771 --> 00:22:42,531
- regarding your previous career path.
- Fire away.

332
00:22:43,147 --> 00:22:45,839
When you met with other psychics...
Real psychics...

333
00:22:46,236 --> 00:22:48,264
Could they tell
you were just pretending?

334
00:22:48,933 --> 00:22:50,872
There's no such thing as real psychics.

335
00:22:51,032 --> 00:22:53,766
I beg to differ.
My cousin Yolanda is a psychic.

336
00:22:54,077 --> 00:22:56,478
Your cousin is deluded
or dishonest, or both.

337
00:22:57,057 --> 00:22:58,057
Steady.

338
00:22:58,832 --> 00:23:00,503
He's entitled to his opinion.

339
00:23:00,623 --> 00:23:01,975
He's wrong, though.

340
00:23:02,169 --> 00:23:03,718
- She has power.
- Thank you.

341
00:23:03,879 --> 00:23:07,138
She can communicate with the other side.
I've seen her do it myself.

342
00:23:07,578 --> 00:23:09,683
She let you speak
with someone that's gone.

343
00:23:10,651 --> 00:23:13,420
Someone that you love
and still miss very much.

344
00:23:15,013 --> 00:23:17,399
You wanted her power to be real,
so it was.

345
00:23:19,644 --> 00:23:22,320
You're so sure you're right.
Science don't know everything.

346
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,573
500 years ago,
radio would've seemed like magic.

347
00:23:25,045 --> 00:23:25,949
Exactly.

348
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:28,993
{\500 years i}In the future, it could be{\ totally} normal
to communicate with the other side.

349
00:23:29,388 --> 00:23:30,493
The "other side."

350
00:23:34,441 --> 00:23:35,959
Your father's a football coach.

351
00:23:37,587 --> 00:23:40,422
- How'd you know that?
- It's obvious from your whole demeanor.

352
00:23:40,776 --> 00:23:44,551
My point is, didn't Dad
always say, "Life is like football?

353
00:23:44,991 --> 00:23:47,387
"When that final whistle blows,
the game is over."

354
00:23:48,099 --> 00:23:49,848
Done. There is no more.

355
00:23:50,008 --> 00:23:52,651
There is no "other side."
This is it...

356
00:23:53,016 --> 00:23:55,406
Lobster and bread rolls
and nautical kitsch.

357
00:23:55,526 --> 00:23:57,397
And then... Nothingness.

358
00:23:58,588 --> 00:23:59,983
You poor, sad man.

359
00:24:00,535 --> 00:24:02,566
The kingdom of God is a real place.

360
00:24:04,675 --> 00:24:07,712
Later tonight, when Rigsby asks you
to come back to his hotel room...

361
00:24:12,447 --> 00:24:13,447
Say yes.

362
00:24:14,088 --> 00:24:15,449
- Excuse me?
- I know.

363
00:24:15,569 --> 00:24:18,001
You were planning on refusing him
very curtly.

364
00:24:18,161 --> 00:24:21,588
First week on the job, you wanna set
a tone. No monkey business. But why not?

365
00:24:22,499 --> 00:24:24,375
Rigsby is an excellent lover,
I'm sure.

366
00:24:25,335 --> 00:24:26,662
Tough but fair. Right?

367
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,380
Right.

368
00:24:35,154 --> 00:24:37,126
The kingdom of God is a real place,

369
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,195
and you have an immortal soul.

370
00:24:41,775 --> 00:24:43,275
I do so hope you're wrong.

371
00:24:50,374 --> 00:24:52,380
- Good night.
- Later, dude.

372
00:25:00,652 --> 00:25:01,831
This is... me.

373
00:25:06,882 --> 00:25:08,800
Welcome to the unit, Agent Van Pelt.

374
00:25:09,337 --> 00:25:10,731
Thank you, Agent Rigsby.

375
00:25:12,432 --> 00:25:14,594
<i>She explodes into action,</i>

376
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:17,646
<i>reaching up to 60 miles per hour.</i>

377
00:25:18,277 --> 00:25:19,665
<i>She easily outruns</i>

378
00:25:20,156 --> 00:25:21,950
<i>her terrifying prey.</i>

379
00:26:13,234 --> 00:26:15,442
"Greetings, old friend.
It's been a while.

380
00:26:16,077 --> 00:26:18,891
"I hope you are keeping well.
I am thriving and happy.

381
00:26:19,267 --> 00:26:22,417
"I have 12 wives now
and will soon begin courting number 13.

382
00:26:23,568 --> 00:26:25,003
"Why can't you catch me?

383
00:26:25,471 --> 00:26:28,354
"You must feel so powerless
and stupid and sad.

384
00:26:29,084 --> 00:26:30,925
"Oh, well. All the best.

385
00:26:31,827 --> 00:26:32,970
"Red John."

386
00:26:34,332 --> 00:26:36,231
That sounds like the real deal to me.

387
00:26:36,351 --> 00:26:39,123
Sounds like Red John. It's not.
Red John wouldn't risk capture

388
00:26:39,243 --> 00:26:41,853
- just to taunt me.
- The{\ real} killer{\'s trying to} wanna throw us offtrack?

389
00:26:42,615 --> 00:26:45,481
Cho, find out where Price Randolph
was a half an hour ago.

390
00:26:45,642 --> 00:26:47,859
Rigsby, I want you to check the hotel
security cameras.

391
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,508
Get those over to forensics.

392
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,642
- You okay?
- Absolutely.

393
00:26:58,956 --> 00:27:00,023
Get some sleep.

394
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:40,588
- Hello?
- Good morning.

395
00:27:40,708 --> 00:27:42,145
You didn't sleep, did you?

396
00:27:47,505 --> 00:27:50,516
I'd like to make an appointment
with Dr. Wagner, please. It's urgent.

397
00:27:51,117 --> 00:27:52,704
Jane. Patrick Jane.

398
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,166
Yeah, I'll hold.

399
00:27:55,399 --> 00:27:57,107
Forensics maybe got a break.

400
00:27:57,227 --> 00:27:59,680
The blood on the cloth
in the envelope is Alison Randolph's.

401
00:28:00,027 --> 00:28:01,765
But they found a hair in there...

402
00:28:02,063 --> 00:28:03,637
Doesn't belong to her or Tannen.

403
00:28:04,503 --> 00:28:05,979
Guess who itdoesbelong to.

404
00:28:07,474 --> 00:28:09,190
It's yours, Tag.
Amazing, huh?

405
00:28:13,938 --> 00:28:14,938
Science.

406
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:21,244
This is insane.

407
00:28:23,031 --> 00:28:24,394
<i>I didn't kill Alison.</i>

408
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:26,656
<i>How do you explain your hair
in the envelope?</i>

409
00:28:26,826 --> 00:28:28,355
<i>Either it was a mistake, or...</i>

410
00:28:29,675 --> 00:28:31,983
<i>- Or I'm being framed.
- Who would want to frame you?</i>

411
00:28:32,103 --> 00:28:34,277
<i>We don't want to,
if that's what you're thinking.</i>

412
00:28:34,397 --> 00:28:37,886
- He and Alison were lovers.
- <i>Who would want to frame you, Tag?</i>

413
00:28:40,103 --> 00:28:41,139
My brother.

414
00:28:41,338 --> 00:28:42,891
Why would he want to do that?

415
00:28:45,426 --> 00:28:46,811
Alison and I were lovers.

416
00:28:48,763 --> 00:28:50,065
I think you are psychic.

417
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:51,920
You're just afraid to admit it.

418
00:29:04,472 --> 00:29:05,872
Why is it you can't sleep?

419
00:29:06,032 --> 00:29:08,708
Because I can't get the good pills
without talking to a doctor.

420
00:29:11,173 --> 00:29:13,087
And you don't like talking to doctors.

421
00:29:13,362 --> 00:29:16,007
They always wanna be the smartest
person in the room, don't they?

422
00:29:16,749 --> 00:29:18,831
When in fact that's me, obviously.

423
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:25,815
You protect your core self
very fiercely.

424
00:29:27,893 --> 00:29:29,437
What {\do you think }is the reason for that?

425
00:29:32,719 --> 00:29:35,193
You know, this is exactly
how I imagined it would be.

426
00:29:36,611 --> 00:29:38,249
You gonna ask me about my mother?

427
00:29:38,965 --> 00:29:41,968
- Do you want me to{\ ask you about your mother}?
- I just wanna sleep.

428
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:45,488
So what is it that keeps you awake?

429
00:29:47,766 --> 00:29:49,541
- What's his name?
- Red John?

430
00:29:49,951 --> 00:29:51,353
That's right. Red John.

431
00:29:52,394 --> 00:29:55,213
He's killed at least eight women
that we know of.

432
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,950
The police asked me to try
and get a psychic fix on him,

433
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,883
to see if I could get a sense
of who{\ this man} he is.

434
00:30:00,312 --> 00:30:02,065
How do you do that exactly,

435
00:30:02,185 --> 00:30:04,222
get a psychic fix on someone?

436
00:30:04,945 --> 00:30:08,337
Well, Davis,
true demonic evil burns like fire.

437
00:30:08,572 --> 00:30:11,949
It burns with a terrible cold,
dark flame.

438
00:30:12,207 --> 00:30:14,701
I force myself to look into that flame,

439
00:30:15,357 --> 00:30:17,719
and I see an image of the evildoer...

440
00:30:17,966 --> 00:30:20,071
In this case, Red John.

441
00:30:20,875 --> 00:30:22,996
He's an ugly, tormented little man.

442
00:30:23,504 --> 00:30:24,647
A lonely soul.

443
00:30:25,455 --> 00:30:26,455
Sad,

444
00:30:26,976 --> 00:30:27,976
very sad.

445
00:30:49,309 --> 00:30:52,754
"Dear Mr. Jane, I do not like
to be slandered in the media,

446
00:30:52,874 --> 00:30:54,991
"especially by a dirty
money-grubbing fraud.

447
00:30:55,111 --> 00:30:58,588
"If you are a real psychic
instead of a dishonest little worm,

448
00:30:58,708 --> 00:31:00,676
"you wouldn't need to open the door to see

449
00:31:00,796 --> 00:31:03,402
"what I've done to your lovely wife
and child."

450
00:31:12,774 --> 00:31:13,750
Mr. Jane?

451
00:31:17,703 --> 00:31:19,411
What is it that keeps you awake?

452
00:31:29,391 --> 00:31:31,491
When I was a boy, we had a farm.

453
00:31:32,455 --> 00:31:33,698
It's a lot of work.

454
00:31:36,364 --> 00:31:37,786
I was kind of a lazy kid.

455
00:31:38,515 --> 00:31:39,515
Yes?

456
00:31:44,205 --> 00:31:47,955
I'd always be trying to get my{\ little} brother
Jimmy to do my chores for me.

457
00:31:50,704 --> 00:31:54,294
One day, I promised him
a dollar if he'd cut the firewood.

458
00:31:58,446 --> 00:32:01,841
He opened up an artery in his leg
on the saw, and he bled to death...

459
00:32:04,953 --> 00:32:05,953
Died...

460
00:32:08,455 --> 00:32:09,764
Doing my chores for me.

461
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,471
You know...

462
00:32:18,623 --> 00:32:22,496
That's almost exactly the same thing
that happened to Johnny Cash.

463
00:32:23,829 --> 00:32:24,932
Is it really?

464
00:32:29,485 --> 00:32:30,622
That's spooky.

465
00:32:35,451 --> 00:32:37,016
- Mr. Rando...
- Cut the crap.

466
00:32:37,136 --> 00:32:39,751
My brother's done nothing. {\And y}You{\ scumbags} haven't
got the stones to come after me,

467
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:42,076
so you come after my family.
That is{\ flat-out} persecution.

468
00:32:42,196 --> 00:32:44,464
- Price, what did we agree?
- Rest assured,

469
00:32:44,625 --> 00:32:47,355
there's no intent to persecute you.
We{\ scumbags} are holding your brother

470
00:32:47,475 --> 00:32:50,645
'cause we have physical evidence linking
him to the crime and potential motive

471
00:32:50,765 --> 00:32:53,891
in that he states whenever you weren't
around, he was banging your wife{\ like a big bass drum}.

472
00:32:55,712 --> 00:32:56,994
Tag and Alison?

473
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:03,232
That's what he states. He further states
that{\ it was} you{\ that} killed Alison,

474
00:33:03,394 --> 00:33:05,945
- and you're{\ now} trying to frame him{\ in revenge}.
- What'd you say?

475
00:33:07,211 --> 00:33:08,252
Bastard!

476
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:14,200
You treated her like trash!
What did you expect?!

477
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,665
I didn't expect my little brother
to be banging my wife! You bastard!

478
00:33:27,584 --> 00:33:30,122
Everything you've told me
is total fiction, isn't it?

479
00:33:34,034 --> 00:33:34,932
Why?

480
00:33:36,385 --> 00:33:38,853
I can tell you're in real pain.
Why not tell the truth?

481
00:33:40,561 --> 00:33:41,767
The truth is mine.

482
00:33:46,036 --> 00:33:47,987
- I hear ya.
- Thank you.

483
00:33:59,219 --> 00:34:01,672
Remember, we were talking
about Tannen the other day,

484
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:04,060
I asked you if he kept a diary,
and you said he did?

485
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,468
- There's no diary among his effects.
- No.

486
00:34:06,749 --> 00:34:07,799
I'm sorry, no?

487
00:34:08,473 --> 00:34:11,518
No. You have it wrong.
I didn't think he kept a diary.

488
00:34:12,035 --> 00:34:13,038
Strange.

489
00:34:14,053 --> 00:34:16,211
Then it must have been someone else
who told me.

490
00:34:17,095 --> 00:34:18,685
Either that or I'm going mad.

491
00:34:20,694 --> 00:34:24,148
But I definitely, 100% remember hearing
that Tannen kept a diary.

492
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:28,284
Well, that is strange, but
why does it matter if he kept a diary?

493
00:34:28,404 --> 00:34:30,627
It doesn't matter.
Only I was thinking,

494
00:34:31,583 --> 00:34:33,682
why do magicians
have beautiful girl assistants?

495
00:34:35,027 --> 00:34:35,909
Why?

496
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:38,412
Because they're reliable
distracters of attention.

497
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:41,797
People will look at a beautiful girl
for a long time before they look

498
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:45,918
where they should be looking if they
wanna see how the trick really works.

499
00:34:47,899 --> 00:34:50,317
Anyhow, I'll send over
a couple of forensics guys tomorrow

500
00:34:50,437 --> 00:34:52,598
to search his office
and locate that diary.

501
00:34:52,942 --> 00:34:54,818
Didn't they already search his office?

502
00:34:55,673 --> 00:34:57,662
They never do it thoroughly
the first time.

503
00:34:57,884 --> 00:34:59,058
Once more for luck.

504
00:35:00,097 --> 00:35:02,549
It's gotta be there somewhere.
Thanks for everything, doc.

505
00:35:03,521 --> 00:35:05,158
- Good night.
- Good night.

506
00:35:42,844 --> 00:35:43,844
Lost something?

507
00:35:46,258 --> 00:35:48,282
- How did you get in?
- Door was open.

508
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:50,264
I think I left my phone in your office.

509
00:35:50,735 --> 00:35:54,155
- The door wasn't open.
- Must have been. Here I am.

510
00:35:59,683 --> 00:36:00,991
What are you doing?

511
00:36:04,743 --> 00:36:08,104
I confess,
the temptation to play detective

512
00:36:08,224 --> 00:36:09,738
was a little too strong.

513
00:36:10,852 --> 00:36:12,389
I was looking for that diary.

514
00:36:15,167 --> 00:36:17,845
- I got a little carried away.
- No kidding.

515
00:36:19,182 --> 00:36:20,055
No diary?

516
00:36:21,543 --> 00:36:22,635
No diary.

517
00:36:24,738 --> 00:36:27,687
Maybe I should have a gander.
I'm good at finding things.

518
00:36:28,731 --> 00:36:29,797
Be my guest.

519
00:37:33,868 --> 00:37:34,881
Eureka.

520
00:37:40,546 --> 00:37:42,346
Dr. Wagner, thanks for your help.

521
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,120
Mr. Jane.

522
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,027
Your phone.

523
00:37:57,157 --> 00:37:58,157
Right.

524
00:38:00,556 --> 00:38:01,556
Thanks.

525
00:38:09,508 --> 00:38:10,687
Yeah. Got it.

526
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:12,936
Silly of me.

527
00:38:13,254 --> 00:38:15,226
- Well, good-bye again.
- Wait.

528
00:38:18,793 --> 00:38:19,987
Give me the diary.

529
00:38:43,381 --> 00:38:45,451
- It's very amusing.
- I try.

530
00:38:50,882 --> 00:38:53,618
I knew.
I knew it might be a trick, but I...

531
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,421
I had to be sure.

532
00:38:59,015 --> 00:39:00,420
That's how the trick works.

533
00:39:01,746 --> 00:39:02,927
What led you to me?

534
00:39:03,945 --> 00:39:06,258
Not that I'm saying I did it.
I'm just asking.

535
00:39:07,381 --> 00:39:10,000
When we first met, you said
you didn't know who Red John was,

536
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,378
but you have books

537
00:39:11,923 --> 00:39:15,439
on criminal psychiatry... there...
That have chapters on him.

538
00:39:16,251 --> 00:39:20,356
You're the Randolph family doctor,
so you could{\ easily} get a strand of Tag's hair,

539
00:39:21,098 --> 00:39:23,282
and, being a doctor,

540
00:39:24,817 --> 00:39:27,458
you could hack up another human
without difficulty.

541
00:39:29,479 --> 00:39:30,851
It's obvious it was you.

542
00:39:32,629 --> 00:39:33,666
That's it?

543
00:39:35,256 --> 00:39:36,308
You have nothing.

544
00:39:37,507 --> 00:39:39,821
- That's just guesswork.
- I know.

545
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:43,134
I just wanted to be sure
I had the right answer.

546
00:39:45,129 --> 00:39:46,881
I was surprised.
I gotta be honest.

547
00:39:47,714 --> 00:39:49,758
You don't seem to be a wicked man.

548
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:53,060
But you are.

549
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:57,944
You're angry about the letter.

550
00:40:00,077 --> 00:40:01,817
Yeah, it was a bit mean-spirited.

551
00:40:04,614 --> 00:40:06,823
For the record,
I'm sorry about your family.

552
00:40:07,809 --> 00:40:10,578
I can only imagine your pain.
I'm not...

553
00:40:11,584 --> 00:40:12,655
a wicked man.

554
00:40:14,049 --> 00:40:16,499
- My conscience is clear.
- Really?

555
00:40:17,312 --> 00:40:21,635
Right now in Africa, there's
3,000 beautiful children alive today

556
00:40:21,755 --> 00:40:24,331
who should be dead,
but they aren't because of me.

557
00:40:26,378 --> 00:40:28,165
Tannen was gonna ruin me

558
00:40:29,087 --> 00:40:31,375
and destroy all that work...

559
00:40:34,512 --> 00:40:35,512
Over nothing.

560
00:40:36,186 --> 00:40:37,186
Money.

561
00:40:37,505 --> 00:40:39,461
"Theft," he called it.

562
00:40:40,684 --> 00:40:41,702
"Embezzlement."

563
00:40:42,261 --> 00:40:43,785
Self-righteous idiot.

564
00:40:45,997 --> 00:40:48,693
It's simple math.
If I go to jail,

565
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:51,839
thousands of kids will die.

566
00:40:53,197 --> 00:40:56,415
So I made a rational,
moral decision to kill Tannen...

567
00:40:57,707 --> 00:40:58,959
For the greater good.

568
00:40:59,186 --> 00:41:00,186
And Alison?

569
00:41:00,793 --> 00:41:02,101
What did she do wrong?

570
00:41:04,588 --> 00:41:08,344
As you said, she was the magician's
assistant, just a distraction.

571
00:41:09,871 --> 00:41:13,474
If only Tannen died, the police would've
been all over this place, wouldn't they?

572
00:41:13,997 --> 00:41:15,226
Truly, is killing two

573
00:41:16,063 --> 00:41:17,832
any worse than killing one,

574
00:41:17,952 --> 00:41:20,432
when so many lives are at stake?
I don't think so.

575
00:41:21,648 --> 00:41:23,058
You poor, sad man.

576
00:41:24,306 --> 00:41:27,613
- You're under arrest. Let's go.
- I'm pointing a gun at you.

577
00:41:27,774 --> 00:41:29,791
You really think
I would set you up so nicely

578
00:41:29,911 --> 00:41:31,700
and let you pull a loaded gun on me?

579
00:41:33,362 --> 00:41:34,969
I took the bullets out earlier.

580
00:41:49,763 --> 00:41:51,976
- You're late! Draw your weapon!
- What?

581
00:41:53,144 --> 00:41:54,247
Drop the gun!

582
00:41:54,754 --> 00:41:55,986
Hands on your head.

583
00:41:56,568 --> 00:41:57,809
Get down on your knees.

584
00:41:58,231 --> 00:41:59,231
Down.

585
00:42:15,637 --> 00:42:17,246
Closed case doughnuts are here.

586
00:42:28,043 --> 00:42:31,135
I just went to get sleeping pills,
I swear{\ to God}. I didn't even wanna go.

587
00:42:31,631 --> 00:42:33,468
- You know I didn't want to go.
- Right.

588
00:42:34,882 --> 00:42:36,946
Yeah, you didn't set Wagner up...

589
00:42:37,934 --> 00:42:39,768
Didn't figure it was him days ago.

590
00:42:40,083 --> 00:42:42,188
You didn't let us tear apart
the victim's family

591
00:42:42,308 --> 00:42:44,404
simply to satisfy
your childish need for drama.

592
00:42:44,851 --> 00:42:47,568
That family was screwed anyway.
Don't blame yourselves, guys.

593
00:43:07,164 --> 00:43:08,378
Don't even start.

594
00:43:08,685 --> 00:43:09,901
I'm still angry.

595
00:43:10,684 --> 00:43:12,604
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.

596
00:43:20,041 --> 00:43:21,119
A frog?

597
00:43:21,637 --> 00:43:23,985
Well, this makes everything better,
doesn't it?
