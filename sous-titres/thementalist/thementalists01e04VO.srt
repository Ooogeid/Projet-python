2
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,100
Mind running it for us,inspector?

3
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:34,020
Not sure why you all were called in.

4
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,740
We could handle it.

5
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:40,340
Place belongs to jason
sands,big-ass political contributor.

6
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,600
Been missing since last night.

7
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,250
That's why we're here.

8
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,640
Attorney general likes to stay
on top of these kinds of things.

9
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:51,460
Mr. Sands' wife jennifer arrived home
last night with their daughter about 9:00.

10
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,920
She found her husband gone and this...

11
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,880
Thanks,guys.

12
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,950
There's been no ransom demand yet,but
i expect we'll get something soon.

13
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,610
If you want our tech guys to
set taps,i gotta let 'em know.

14
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,560
That's okay. We can handle it.

15
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,370
Do you know where his family is?

16
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,730
Uh,with friends.

17
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,130
Mrs. Sands thought it would be best
for the little girl,and we agreed.

18
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,340
Any sign of forced entry?

19
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,730
No,it must have been a front door job,someone
posing as a courier or what have you.

20
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,970
He's still here.

21
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:38,490
Not unless he's
invisible,he's not,agent jane.

22
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,800
He's not an agent. He's a consultant.

23
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,550
No badge. No gun.

24
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,580
They don't even give me dental.

25
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:49,710
Oh,yeah. You're the one they were
telling me about--the psychic.

26
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,410
Sorry,gandalf. In our own bumbling
way,we did look around pretty good.

27
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,970
He's not here.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,080
He's here,and there's no
such thing as psychics.

29
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:02,070
He was tortured in this chair...

30
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,670
To give them a pass code...

31
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,270
Pass code to what?

32
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,370
Could you humor me,inspector?

33
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,350
Could you try and pick
up that sheet of paper?

34
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,350
- All right.
- Thanks.

35
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,910
That's--that's
it.

36
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,970
Well,the bookcase must have moved.

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,260
After these papers were
spread all over the floor?

38
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,850
It's a door. To a safe?

39
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,100
- Or a safe room.
- Yes.

40
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:43,630
The intruder must have been distracted by
something,left sands alone for a moment,

41
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,740
Sands punches in the code,and
before they can stop him,

42
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,250
Goes into the safe room and
shuts the door behind him.

43
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,940
Which will open if you
press the buttons a lot?

44
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,400
I'm entering the top
ten pass code choices.

45
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:01,230
But if it is a safe room,wouldn't it have a
silent alarm connected to a security company?

46
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,450
Not if you're the
paranoid,secretive type.

47
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:08,090
You make a safe room
only you know about.

48
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,930
I guess we need a locksmith.

49
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,870
Hang on a minute.

50
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,380
Farewell and adieu to
you,fair spanish maidens

51
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:25,890
farewell and adieu
to you,Ladies of spain

52
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:31,180
for we've received orders
for to sail back to boston

53
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:37,440
And so never more shall we see you...

54
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,490
Again.

Ladies in Red

58
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,340
I look around.I don't see anyone here who could
torture a man to death with pliers and a lit cigar.

59
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:24,450
Picture them naked rr
and ravenously hungry.

60
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,790
You know,strictly speaking,he
wasn't tortured to death.

61
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,370
He bled to death on his own
in his little hidey-hole there.

62
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,810
Kind of has himself to blame then,huh?

63
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,150
Mm,kind of.

64
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:35,360
How does the widow check out?

65
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,890
The night of the murder,she and her daughter
were at a concert-- "peter & the wolf."

66
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,410
- She have stubs?
- Yep.

67
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,250
Who's the suit hovering around her?

68
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,680
That's michael claymore
bennett iii,sands' lawyer.

69
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:48,080
What about him?

70
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,690
The widow's scared of him or...

71
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,230
Or?

72
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,260
Or,uh,he's reassuring her of
something else that she's scared of.

73
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,140
- Which is it?
- I don't know. Could be both.

74
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,700
Well,we can't question 'em here.

75
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,490
Let's go get started on
sands' computer files.

76
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,340
- You guys stay here till this thing's over.
- Yes,boss.

77
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,130
You never know. Somebody might confess.

78
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,300
Van pelt,you're killing me.

79
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,110
- Can i ask you a personal question?
- Nope.

80
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,160
Have you told her how you feel?

81
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,180
She's a co-worker. It's against
the rules. That's how i feel.

82
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,310
That's not how you feel.

83
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,690
I sent out the vibes. I got nothing
back,okay? So i'm leaving them alone.

84
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,160
Vibes. Really? Vibes?

85
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,740
That's where he stares at the back of her
neck for several hours. Women love that.

86
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,580
Oh,shut up,cho.

87
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,220
You gotta go get her,man.
You gotta seduce her.

88
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:44,580
Yeah,well,seduction's
not my strong point.

89
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,860
Man,seduction's easy once you know the
basic principles. There's nothing to it.

90
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:52,400
Oh,really? Well,i don't see a
crowd of women following you around.

91
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:55,260
Why would i want a crowd of
women following me around?

92
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,810
Okay. I'll bite.

93
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,880
What's the basic principle?

94
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,630
- Cost you a dollar.
- For what?

95
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,750
So you pay attention.

96
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,040
- Love and affection.
- What?

97
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:11,380
- Love and affection.
- Give me my dollar back.

98
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,640
When you're seducing someone,what
are you offering them?

99
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,150
Love and affection.

100
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,390
Who doesn't want love and
affection? It's that simple.

101
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,920
Seriously,give me my dollar back.

102
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,290
Let me demonstrate.

103
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:24,630
I will bet you 100 more of these
dollars that i can seduce any woman here.

104
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,000
Okay. The widow.

105
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,780
Wait a minute. What
are you-- J-j-jane!

106
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,350
Good job.

107
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,280
Hello,sweetheart.

108
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,540
Mrs. Sands,my name is patrick jane,cbi.

109
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,810
I'm sorry for your loss.

110
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,510
Up close,you're really very beautiful.

111
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:00,130
That's...Totally
inappropriate and--

112
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,870
listen to me,jennifer.

113
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,610
I don't know what kind of
hold this man has over you...

114
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,660
- Excuse me.
- Back up now.

115
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,770
And i'm not exactly sure what kind of trouble
you're in,but i'm confident that i can help you.

116
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:19,040
- Call me,and i'll come.
- Excuse me,sir. You have to leave.

117
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:23,220
No problem. Sorry. Sorry
about that. Come on. Come on.

118
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:25,300
I'm so sorry.

119
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,930
Looks like you owe me 100 bucks.

120
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,630
Early days,rigsby. Early days.

122
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,740
I'm disappointed. I-i'm--i'm very
disappointed,and i'm embarrassed.

123
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,730
How could you do this me?

124
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:48,190
I told the mayor of san francisco that
i was putting my best people on this.

125
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,970
Holy mother!

126
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,300
Who takes off the freakin'
labels? I mean,what is that?

127
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,660
Is this--is this
real or is that decaf?

128
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,310
I mean,how am i supposed
to know which is which?

129
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,280
Mix 'em both half and half
and drink twice as much.

130
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,050
What kind of idiot drinks
decaf anyway? What is the point?

131
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,990
And what were you thinking,leaving
this man alone at an event like that?

132
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,220
No excuses.

133
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,970
I mistakenly treated him
as a responsible adult.

134
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,750
- I do have a plan.
- Which is?

135
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,280
Uh,first win the
widow's confidence--

136
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:21,790
Aside from her lawyer making an official
complaint at the attorney general,

137
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,330
How is that going for you?

138
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,710
She's playing hard to get.

139
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,080
Jane,you close cases.

140
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:33,070
You--you close like a fiend,so i
tolerate you,and i--and i protect you.

141
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,540
And i let you make
lisbon's life a misery.

142
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,150
But th-there is a line.

143
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:43,100
There is a line,and when you cross
it,i will protect myself and this unit,

144
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,530
- and i will throw you to the wolves.
- Okay.

145
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,480
As long as we're clear.

146
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,400
Yes?

147
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,650
Yeah. It's the A. G. 'S office.

148
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:03,260
Um,mrs. Sands is willing to drop the
matter if jane will apologize to her.

149
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,410
Great. I'll make the call.

150
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:08,280
She wants to hear it
in person,at her house.

151
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,800
Do you want to see my trolls?

152
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,240
I'd love to.

153
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,500
This one's a boy. His
name is woody sands.

154
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,740
Yeah. Come.

155
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,400
You have a very nice room.

156
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,940
Thank you. My daddy made it for me.

157
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,360
This one's a girl.

158
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,060
Her name is wanda sands.

159
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,980
This one's a
girl,too. Her name is--

160
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,260
I bet i can guess her name.

161
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,520
- Warren moon.
- No.

162
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,950
- Wiley post?
- No.

163
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,750
- Wendy sands.
- Yes.

164
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:40,530
- Bye.
- Bye.

165
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,130
Thank you.

166
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:49,590
- Are you married,mr. Jane?
- Was.

167
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,680
- She's dead.
- Oh,i'm sorry. What happened?

168
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,650
It doesn't matter.

169
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:59,280
You have a very strange
way about you,mr. Jane.

170
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,260
Do i?

171
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:04,280
After the memorial service,i don't
know why i simply don't have you fired.

172
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,240
Are you usually so forthright?

173
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:09,270
What's on your mind,mrs.
Sands? Why am i here?

174
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,440
You know why. I want an apology.

175
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:15,160
No,you don't.

176
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:24,300
Here you go,julie.

177
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,070
You told me if i was ever to
need your help,i should call you.

178
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,780
Yes.

179
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,790
- And here i am.
- You were right.

180
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,420
Bennett did upset me at the service.

181
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,910
- He told me the truth about jason.
- Which is?

182
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,600
His investment business was
a sham,went broke ages ago.

183
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,670
Our bank accounts are empty.

184
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:50,270
He left me and julie with nothing
but massive debts,penniless.

185
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,400
We're gonna have to sell the house
and--and--and--and everything else we own.

186
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,800
I'm so sorry.

187
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,600
The I. R. S. And the S. E. C. And i don't
know who else were investigating him for fraud.

188
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:04,440
- He told you nothing?
- Nothing. Nothing.

189
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,990
Turns out our--our
marriage was a lie.

190
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:11,710
Our--our whole life
together was a lie.

191
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:15,880
- Perhaps he was ashamed in his failure.
- No.

192
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:19,000
Ashamed? Jason? No.

193
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,180
I always knew he had a-a
secretive,mistrustful side,but this?

194
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,790
Every couple has secrets.

195
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,030
There are rooms in this house
i didn't even know were there.

196
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,790
Mrs. Sands,you asked me...

197
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,630
- To help you.
- Yes.

198
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,870
How can i do that?

199
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:41,180
If i know jason,he--he--
there's something left.

200
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:43,720
He would have hid a nest egg somewhere.

201
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,430
Don't you think it's possible?

202
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:48,350
Whoever killed him certainly thought so.

203
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,230
Sheriff's department.

204
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:00,500
What is this? Who are you?

205
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:03,290
Asset seizure. No trouble.

206
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,500
- Start upstairs,boys.
- Cbi. Department of justice.

207
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,860
Hang on a second.

208
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:15,150
Yeah,this is in order,but,uh,where's
your lethal toxins immunization papers?

209
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:15,970
Excuse me?

210
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,320
Did they not tell you the score here?

211
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,950
Did you get your shots?

212
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,450
Shots? What are you talking about?

213
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,450
Shots. There was a murder here.

214
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:26,350
- Yeah,i know.
- Excuse me a minute.

215
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:32,360
Suspected poisoning.

216
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,410
Anthrax.

217
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,480
Come on. Let's,uh,let's go,guys.

218
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,880
Get your shots. We'll talk.

219
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,940
Shots.

220
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:51,210
Looks like sands was bust all right.

221
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,740
He used to be huge,but he made
some really bad calls in I. T.

222
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:58,610
Over the past five years,his business
has dwindled down to almost nothing.

223
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,350
No clients. No income.

224
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,070
There were indictments and injunctions and
the whole nightmare coming,just down the road.

225
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,020
The strange thing is,until
a couple of weeks ago,

226
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:09,720
There was $10 million in his personal
accounts in cash and bonds and stocks,

227
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,390
Most of it deposited over the last year.

228
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,680
His business is dead for years.
Where do you get $10 million from?

229
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,060
More importantly,where is it now?

230
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,800
That's what his killers wanted to know.

231
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:19,450
Are you sure the widow
doesn't know where it is?

232
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:23,700
No,she's genuinely broke
and genuinely scared.

233
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,450
- You're not soft on her,are you?
- No.

234
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,360
Maybe a little.

235
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,480
We need to talk to
the lawyer.What's his--

236
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:32,150
bennett? We need to talk to him.

237
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,650
You need to stay well away.

238
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,200
Did you say maybe a little?

239
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:39,510
She's a gorgeous,grieving
widow. Of course maybe a little.

240
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,350
Don't worry. It's not
going to affect my work.

241
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,610
I'm a law enforcement
professional. Jeez.

242
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,770
My sincere apologies for our
operative jane,by the way.

243
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,050
Unconscionable.

244
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:57,780
Supervising agent minelli
gave him a severe reprimand.

245
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:00,290
Well,think nothing of it.

246
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,610
I can't tell you how sad i am
about all this. How can i help?

247
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,090
I'll try and be brief.
You were sands' lawyer.

248
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,740
You had to have known
he was in ruinous debt.

249
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:14,070
Yeah,i knew there were difficulties,but
i had no idea how deep he was in it.

250
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,410
I don't deal in his business affairs.

251
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:20,440
I'm his family lawyer,so i look
after his personal financial matters,

252
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,270
Which until recently,were
in pretty good shape.

253
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:26,320
Yeah,two weeks ago,he converted a
$10 million pension account into cash.

254
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:27,740
It's pretty much all he had.

255
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,500
Which is his right. I learned about
it after the fact from his accountants.

256
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:36,830
It's a huge withdrawal,but,uh,of course,i
figured he had much more in reserve.

257
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,640
Did you ask him what he
was doing with the money?

258
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,110
I did.

259
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,080
He told me he needed
it to surprise his wife.

260
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:46,130
He did that all right.

261
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,150
I believed him.

262
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,510
What do you believe now?

263
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,280
I think he was looking at jail time.

264
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:54,420
I think he grabbed as much cash as
he could,and he was gonna run away.

265
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:57,240
Thanks for your help,counselor.
We'll be in touch.

266
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,820
Okay. Whatever you
need,i'm at your service.

267
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:03,300
We found out where that
money was coming from.

268
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:08,590
Sands owns an office supply company that supplies
this happy landings entertainment with copy paper.

269
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,450
Over the last 2
years,$55. 2 million worth.

270
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,470
Who owns happy landings entertainment?

271
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:17,210
It's a shell company hidden in a swiss
trust wrapped in a dummy corporation.

272
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,960
It'll take a while to untangle.

273
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,290
But sands' company?

274
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,060
It's the only one of his businesses
under a separate corporate address.

275
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,200
In sausalito?

276
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,930
- Odd,huh?
- Nice work.

277
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,130
Are we gonna have a look?

278
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,910
We are. You're gonna stay
here and keep digging.

279
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,620
Who owns happy landings entertainment?

280
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:40,430
{\a6} <i>Sau......</i>

281
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,730
Doesn't look like a copy
paper business,does it?

282
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,490
Uh,no.

283
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,810
This is it. You coming aboard?

284
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:46,690
Why not?

285
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:49,510
If sands lied about this,what
else did he cover up?

286
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:20,440
The place is trashed.

287
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,430
Cho.

288
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,850
I'm--i'm just gonna
wait on--on the jetty.

289
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,240
Who are you?

290
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:06,540
Patrick jane,cbi.

291
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,760
Don't shoot.

292
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,130
What's that,cbi?

293
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:16,080
Police. Lay the gun down.

294
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:18,440
- Show me the badge.
- Put the gun down!

295
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:22,610
Okay,police. I make
no trouble. No problem.

296
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:24,920
Who'd you think we were?

297
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,430
Nobody.

298
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,150
Who are you? What are you looking for?

299
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,910
This is my boat. I can do what i like.

300
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,070
Yeah,it's very nice,very put together.

301
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,050
This boat belongs to jason sands.

302
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:38,650
Yes,and jason sands is my fianc\.Y

303
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:48,540
***********With burglary,vandalism,assault
with a deadly weapon.

304
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,510
That's 10 to 15 right there.

305
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,420
Wouldn't you rather talk
to us about your situation?

306
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,280
From you,i buy cookies.

307
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:56,780
I don't talk about situation.

308
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:59,080
Listen. We
have enough--

309
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,680
The handsome one.

310
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,740
Gay,yes?

311
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,260
This is a murder investigation.

312
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,970
You've got no alibi for
the time frame in question.

313
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:21,160
We're looking at you as a suspect.

314
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:24,100
You should take this a
little more seriously.

315
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:27,810
You know,when i was this big,

316
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:31,840
i was in a detention camp for two years.

317
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,480
- You understand?
- I understand.

318
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:36,230
No,you don't.

319
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,820
That was
serious. This--no.

320
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,230
What do you do for a living?

321
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:47,660
I dance,model,acting.

322
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,720
Is that a good living?

323
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,080
What's good?

324
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:52,560
How long were you and
jason sands lovers?

325
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:55,590
Two years. We were-- we
were more than lovers.

326
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,100
We were engaged to be married.

327
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,140
He was already married.

328
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,730
No,he was divorcing her.

329
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,620
- She doesn't know that.
- Oh,sure,she does.

330
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:05,590
Why would she tell
you? It's embarrassing.

331
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,000
He doesn't want her
anymore. It is embarrassing.

332
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:10,020
What were you looking for?

333
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,230
And we loved each other.

334
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,840
You loved each other. We hear that.

335
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:15,500
What were you looking for on the boat?

336
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,940
Jason bought $10 million of
diamonds for when we would run away.

337
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,780
I was looking for them.

338
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,230
When did he buy them?

339
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,760
A month ago.

340
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:28,230
Once he showed me them.

341
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,470
They are beautiful.

342
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,890
And then he hid them
somewhere. I don't know where.

343
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,950
You were gonna run away?

344
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,000
Jason knew that it was
the end of the road here.

345
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:43,440
He was going to jail or going
to get killed,so we make a plan.

346
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:46,340
We are going,to,uh,run
away in the sailboat.

347
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,920
You and him on a sailboat.

348
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:53,140
No,he was a good sailor. He teach me.

349
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:58,270
If,um,those bastards didn't kill him,

350
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:02,780
maybe me and him and
julie would be in tahiti,

351
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:05,850
Rich,instead of here with you.

352
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,810
Y-you were gonna take julie?

353
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:11,190
What bastards. You know who killed him?

354
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,040
- Yeah,sure,i know.
- Tell us.

355
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:15,470
If i tell you,i leave here now.

356
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,220
You drop this burglary stupidness.

357
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,600
I don't testify. Nothing.

358
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:24,000
I give you names. That's it.

359
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,580
Deal.

360
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:31,430
These,um,scum pigs run nightclubs.

361
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:37,610
Jason cleans their,uh,drug
and,um,girl money for them.

362
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:41,430
It's this money he uses
to buy the diamonds.

363
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:44,360
Did they have a company called happy
landings entertainment out of oakland?

364
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:47,290
I don't know. They live in oakland.

365
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:50,420
These people have names?

366
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:53,750
Dieter webb and carter lewis.

367
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,220
Scum pigs.

368
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:58,660
Scum pigs.

369
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,530
Dieter and carter-- started
out as college deejays.

370
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:05,110
Nightlife impresarios is
what they say they are.

371
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,740
They own clubs,restaurants,boutique
hotels up and down the west coast.

372
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:12,240
Drugs and prostitution started as a natural
sideline,then became their core business.

373
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,240
Did we find 'em?

374
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,590
These guys like to
glide under the radar.

375
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:18,400
According to official records,they
own no property and live nowhere.

376
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:19,890
Their only address is a P. O.box.

377
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,040
Working with san francisco
and oakland P. D.as we speak.

378
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,230
You're letting her go?

379
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,170
She gave us dieter and carter.

380
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:28,470
I could charge her with waving
a gun at jane,but what for?

381
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,830
I don't know,boss.

382
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:33,400
If ever i saw a woman who could use
pliers and a lit cigar on a man,that's her.

383
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:35,650
Miss jonovic,a moment.

384
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,970
Jane,tell her not to leave town.

385
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:45,450
You said you and jason were
planning on leaving with julie.

386
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,200
Yes.

387
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:48,250
- You didn't mind taking the kid?
- No. I love julie.

388
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,780
Me and her are good friends.

389
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,560
You were gonna take her
away from her own mother?

390
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,450
Yes.

391
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:55,870
Oh,that seems a cruel thing to do.

392
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,080
Depends.

393
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,810
She is a cold
person--jennifer.

394
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:02,310
She doesn't care so much about julie.

395
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:06,450
She pretends,but she doesn't really.

396
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,840
Tell me something.

397
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:11,820
Do you think,uh,jennifer
has my diamonds?

398
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:14,180
I don't know. Maybe.

399
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:17,450
Maybe? Did you ask her?

400
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,950
Don't leave town.

401
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,030
As you like.

402
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,540
So love and affection,huh?

403
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:30,510
That's it.

404
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,890
Where you going?

405
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,740
- To speak to the widow.
- Oh,yeah?

406
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:37,370
I want to know if she
knows about the mistress.

407
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,240
This is delicious. Thank you so much.

408
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,230
Do you have children,patrick?

409
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,090
No.

410
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,560
They are the greatest gift.

411
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:01,230
Yes,they are.

412
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:03,010
Put a little bit of ginger in it.

413
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,420
Hey,it's been bothering
the hell of out of me.

414
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:11,920
Peter & the wolf-- is the duck a
flute or a bassoon? I cannot remember.

415
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:14,880
Oh,um,a-a bassoon,i think.

416
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,450
Never mind. Trivia.

417
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:20,610
Listen,i have good
news,and i have bad news.

418
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:24,930
Dieter webb's grandmother is 93 and lives in
a seniors' assisted living center in tucson,

419
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,400
- Has for a decade,but
she-- - Let me guess.

420
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:31,310
She's leasing a high-end vehicle and
recently bought a nice house in oakland.

421
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:31,950
You're good.

422
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,270
Get rigsby and van pelt on it.

423
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,190
$10 million?

424
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,270
Yes,just as you suspected,a
very healthy nest egg.

425
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,710
Oh,that's wonderful. We have to find it.

426
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,450
Wouldn't be a bad idea.

427
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,790
Where should we start?

428
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,980
I don't know.

429
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,040
You found the safe room in a moment.

430
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:59,810
You must be terribly clever at
that kind of thing,finding things.

431
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,000
I could try.

432
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:05,110
But,jennifer,that was the good news.

433
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:09,430
Okay. Bad news?

434
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:14,070
We talked to a woman who appears
to have been jason's mistress.

435
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,320
I knew it.

436
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,420
I knew it. I knew it.

437
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:24,860
I'm sorry.

438
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,310
You didn't know about her?

439
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:31,210
No. What's she like? H-how old is she?

440
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,890
Mid '20s,eastern european,tough.

441
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,800
Good-looking?

442
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:40,220
Not bad.

443
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,690
Does she have the money?

444
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:45,130
Strong possibility.

445
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:49,280
Life is so complicated.

446
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:58,370
Patrick? Will you hold me?

447
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,970
I need someone to hold me. Please.

448
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:08,300
I'm sorry,jennifer. I wish i could.

449
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:18,980
{\a6} <i>O...</i>

450
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:26,250
Where's the entry team? They were
supposed to be here 20 minutes ago.

451
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:29,470
Relax. Guys like these probably
aren't even out of bed yet.

452
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,770
Could be up from the night before.

453
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,930
Maybe went out for some breakfast.

454
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,710
We can deal with 'em.

455
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,040
Suddenly she's steve mcqueen.

456
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,960
They're on the move.

457
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:47,190
Come on. Let's take 'em.

458
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,410
Police! Get out of the car!

459
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,370
Hands up!

460
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,500
- Get out of the car!
- Get out!

461
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,980
Take it easy,man.
Come on. Nice and easy.

462
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:07,410
Up against the car.

463
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:11,190
Up against the car.

464
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,030
Ven aqu^.

465
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:17,750
Freeze!

466
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,390
Hands behind your head.

467
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,980
Hands. Give me your hands!

468
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,750
Let's go.

469
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:52,230
Let's go. Let's go.

470
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,990
You don't want to talk to me,dieter?

471
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:02,070
I've got nothing to say. Call my lawyer.

472
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,560
What do you know about jason sands?

473
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:06,760
I know he's dead.

474
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,470
How much did he take from you?

475
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,300
How much what?

476
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:13,370
We estimate he stole around $10
million from you. Is that about right?

477
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:16,050
Me and my partner,we host parties.

478
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:19,020
I'm doing good,but not that good.

479
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:22,050
$10 million.

480
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:25,190
Jason didn't steal anything from me.

481
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:28,440
You and carter broke into his house,and you
tortured him to death because he stole from you.

482
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:31,650
Look,dude,i know people that know how to
do that stuff. You know what i'm saying?

483
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:35,840
If it was us that tortured him,we'd have
the money right now,and he'd have his life.

484
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,390
- I wouldn't kill him.
- What money?

485
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,730
Oh,you caught me there.

486
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:46,180
The imaginary money you
said he stole from us.

487
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,180
Somebody got there before us.

488
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:50,240
An imaginary somebody.

489
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:54,570
You want my opinion?

490
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:57,530
Now this isn't snitching.
It's just an opinion.

491
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:01,530
Write this down. Adrianna jonovic.

492
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,390
She's a crazy armenian
dancer that jason was tapping.

493
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,520
Why?

494
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:07,840
She's a mercenary bitch.

495
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:10,870
She made jason's life
misery and made him like it.

496
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:16,320
She used to work for us,so
i know whereof i speak.

497
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,810
You should check her out.

498
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:22,080
The other one,lewis,has the same line.

499
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,280
There were class "a"
drugs all over his house,

500
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,270
So we can hold him as long as it takes.

501
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,190
And jonovic?

502
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:32,380
I think she's clean on this one,but we
can bring her back in just to be safe.

503
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:35,020
Well,don't let up on 'em.
We need a result here.

504
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,270
Mrs. Sands.

505
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,900
Patrick,she's gone. She's gone.

506
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:42,660
Th-they--they took
her! My baby is gone!

507
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:45,540
It's okay. It's okay.
W-we'll be right there.

508
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:51,680
YOU KNOW WHAT WE WANT TELL THE
POLICE AND SHE DIES.WAIT FOR OUR CALL.

520
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:27,970
Look,you have to find
my little girl. Please.

521
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,710
What are you talking about,steal a kid?

522
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,200
I've been locked up in this place.

523
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,700
You have friends,remember?

524
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:41,940
So you think that i'd be ass enough to
hire somebody to do it while i'm in here?

525
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:45,890
Dieter has a point.

526
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:48,540
He and carter are bad
guys,but they're not mafia.

527
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:49,710
They don't have that kind of reach.

528
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:52,240
- Or those kind of stones.
- We're up.

529
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,400
The kidnappers just i.
M.'ed jennifer's cell phone.

530
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:57,980
I have your dauthter,do
you have what i want?

531
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:01,070
Say yes. Say yes and tell
'em i'll bring it to them.

532
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:01,900
What? No.

533
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:04,940
It's okay. I know where the
money is,honestly. Say yes.

534
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,660
Yes,i have it.

535
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,650
- Still awake?
- Wide.

536
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,930
Jane,be careful.

537
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:22,390
Don't try and get them to
say anything or stop them.

538
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,260
All we need is their phone.

539
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,950
Just sent us the number. We'll
track the kidnapper's address.

540
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,170
Oh,here comes someone.

541
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:31,380
Jane,just do your mind games
and get out of there,okay?

542
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:33,970
Don't worry,mom.

543
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:40,120
This better not be a trap.

544
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,010
I will kill you. Give me the diamonds.

545
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,960
Oh,adrianna,you're going down
the wrong road.Kidnapping is--

546
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:48,410
i'm not a kidnapper. You
think i want to do this?

547
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:51,170
I have to do this. I
don't want julie to die.

548
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:54,070
Tell me what's going on.
I can--i can help you.

549
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,490
I don't know you. I don't trust you.

550
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:59,240
Just give me the diamonds.

551
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,660
Okay.

552
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,870
Where's julie?

553
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:09,350
I call a number,tell them i have
the diamonds,they give julie.

554
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,020
Call them.

555
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:13,200
How do i know those are real diamonds?

556
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:15,450
They look real to me.

557
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:21,780
Here. Why don't you have a look?

558
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,740
You've seen them before. Here.

559
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:34,100
Oh,i'm sorry.

560
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:38,230
It's okay.

561
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,750
Scan's working.

562
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:47,260
No,this--this... This
is not the diamonds.

563
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:51,010
No,plastic. Forwarding
the last number dialed.

564
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,250
You son of a whore.

565
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:59,630
Signal on that phone is coming from
an apartment building in the presidio.

566
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,000
All units move in.

567
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,830
They will kill julie now.

568
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:03,720
Who is "they"?

569
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:06,270
I don't know. They call me.

570
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:10,730
They send pictures to my
phone of--of julie tied up.

571
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:14,740
They say i must give them
jason's money,or she dies.

572
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,130
I don't have jason's money.

573
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:20,250
Did they ask for jason's money
or did they ask for diamonds?

574
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:20,870
For money.

575
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:24,310
Then they're not gonna hurt julie
if you're telling me the truth.

576
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:27,820
No if. I am telling the truth.

577
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,110
Get back.

578
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:56,260
- Police!
- Police!

579
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:58,370
Freeze!

580
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:04,230
- Drop the weapon!
- Drop the gun!

581
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,860
- Drop it right now!
- Put down the weapon!

582
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:08,990
- Drop the weapon!
- Watch the kid!

583
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:23,600
So far what i know is you guys shot
and grievously wounded a prominent

584
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:27,000
And a very well-liked member
of the san francisco bar.

585
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:28,030
What's going on?

586
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,590
In simple,declarative sentences.

587
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,500
Bennett's our man.

588
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:35,220
He killed jason sands for $10 million in
diamonds,kidnapped julie sands for the same reason.

589
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,430
Either the widow or the
mistress acted as his accomplice.

590
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,050
Which one?

591
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,610
We're trying to nail that down now.

592
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,970
If bennett makes it,he could tell
us,but it doesn't look like he will,

593
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:45,570
so we're gonna need a
confession from his accomplice.

594
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,940
- So,um...
- What?

595
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,880
Jane has an idea.

596
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,960
But if we generate any complaints as to how
we go about this,you've got our backs,right?

597
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:58,310
Well,that depends.

598
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,230
Obviously,we need a win here.

599
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:03,200
But i-i won't sanction anything
underhanded or actionable.

600
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:04,470
That's kind of vague.

601
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:08,560
The whole point of this unit is--is
subtly and discretion and judgment.

602
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:12,300
I expect you to do what's right
without dragging me into it.

603
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:14,220
Really?

604
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:19,100
Yes,yes,lisbon. Of course.

605
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:22,500
If i'm forced to it,i have your back.

606
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,580
I'm insulted you need to ask.

607
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:34,490
Where is she? Where is she? Is she okay?

608
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,600
Yes. She's a little in
shock,but physically she's fine.

609
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:40,480
Not a scratch. Doctors
just want to make sure.

610
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:43,090
Hello,jennifer.

611
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:46,200
Adrianna?

612
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,850
This is a surprise.

613
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,510
What's she doing here?
Shouldn't she be in jail?

614
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,340
Uh,out on bond,ma'am.

615
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,710
So quickly?

616
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,300
I screw better lawyers than you.

617
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:04,670
You've obviously led a very sad
and difficult life to be so twisted.

618
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,380
Truly,adrianna,you have my sympathy.

619
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:09,630
********

620
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,520
Cho,let's move.

621
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:16,060
- What was that name again?
- What name?

622
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:18,330
The one that jane
thought was so important.

623
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,160
Wendy.

624
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:21,440
Right,wendy. Do either of
you know a woman named wendy?

625
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:23,600
- No. No?
- Shame.

626
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:24,730
She'd be worth knowing.

627
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,480
- Cho.
- What?

628
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:28,470
Excuse his levity,ma'am.

629
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,730
This wendy person--
she has the diamonds?

630
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,910
It's a possibility.

631
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,010
Diamonds?

632
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:35,350
By the way,your friend mr.
Bennett is coming along nicely.

633
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,910
I expect we'll be
talking to him shortly.

634
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:38,960
So if there's anything
you want to pass along...

635
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:41,330
But this other police said
that he was a dead man.

636
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,440
- Yeah,they said he was dying.
- No.

637
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,010
No,he'll live.

638
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:55,650
- How'd it go?
- I think we sold it.

639
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,090
- Are you kidding?
- We killed. Yeah.

640
00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:00,930
Well,jane says give it a
moment,let it play itself out.

641
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,700
It's empty. They're both gone.

642
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:14,350
Really? Both?

643
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:17,270
Jane,nobody's there. Come on.

644
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,740
It's okay,baby. Everything
going to be good now.

645
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:27,880
- Everything's good.
- Where have you been?

646
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:43,070
Damn! Damn! Damn!

647
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,290
What are you looking for?

648
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:48,940
You know what i'm looking for.

649
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,240
I'm pretty certain wendy
sands had purple hair.

650
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:57,560
- You may want to call a lawyer now.
- Why? What for?

651
00:37:57,570 --> 00:38:00,160
Don't make this difficult,jennifer.

652
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,950
Bennett told us everything.

653
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,450
Nicely done.

654
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:10,280
You made me think adrianna had the
money,and you made her think i had the money.

655
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:11,800
Clever.

656
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:13,280
Thank you.

657
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:16,440
Coming from a fine actress
like yourself,i'm...

658
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:19,410
I'm flattered.

659
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:22,390
Is it really in diamonds,or
is that just part of the trick?

660
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,870
No trick. Diamonds.

661
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,670
Do you know where?

662
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:27,900
I do.

663
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:29,570
Tell me.

664
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:33,350
Tell me what happened,and
i'll tell you where they are.

665
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,780
This whole time,you
were just playing me.

666
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:39,430
Not the whole time.

667
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,450
That's so sad. I... Thought
we had a real connection.

668
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:45,110
We did.

669
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,340
- We can again.
- No,we can't.

670
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,600
You know,i...

671
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:56,620
I never meant for this to happen.

672
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:00,280
I know.

673
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:02,820
It was bennett.

674
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:05,620
He forced me into this.
He--he planned the whole thing.

675
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:08,530
No,bennett is an idiot
that thinks he's in control,

676
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:13,320
But you played him like a violin,with
those big eyes and those trembling lips.

677
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:14,910
It's a dynamite act.

678
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:17,380
You had me buying it.

679
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,620
If only you'd told me
the duck was an oboe,

680
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:24,520
I probably would've told
you where the diamonds were,

681
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:27,080
And we likely never
would've solved this one.

682
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:28,900
The duck was an oboe?

683
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,810
Yeah. "peter and the wolf."

684
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:35,650
The duck is played by the oboe.

685
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,650
The wolf is a bassoon.

686
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,820
The flute is the songbird.

687
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:43,210
Anyone who's seen it knows that.

688
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,630
But you didn't.

689
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,230
You didn't go to "peter and the wolf."

690
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:52,480
You stayed home and tortured your husband
to make him give you his running away money.

691
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:58,660
Running away with my daughter and
$10 million and that dirty whore.

692
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:00,140
And leave me with nothing?

693
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,410
I don't think so.

694
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:07,460
How do you think it feels that my daughter
prefers her father's whore over me?

695
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,050
That she loves her more
than her own mother?

696
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:13,200
How do you think that feels?

697
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:15,820
I'm sure it hurts.

698
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,600
I always knew there
was a safe in that room,

699
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:26,050
But he would never tell me where
or what the combination was.

700
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:29,930
And i had a real breakthrough insight.

701
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:32,080
I realized...

702
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:36,060
That was our whole
marriage-- withholding.

703
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:39,380
Withholding,always withholding.

704
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:42,750
Whatever it was that i
needed most from jason...

705
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:46,100
That's what he refused to give me.

706
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:56,800
Tell me. Where are they?

707
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:59,730
The diamonds.

708
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:07,930
- Very nice room.
- My daddy made it for me.

709
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,600
When did you first suspect it was her?

710
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,610
Oh,i had an idea at the funeral service.

711
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,130
- No,you did not.
- I did. I did.

712
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:40,540
She,uh,she was looking way too good.

713
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,820
No wife should glow at
her husband's funeral.

714
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:47,760
So you made that bet with rigsby that you could seduce
her with the deliberate intention of snaring her?

715
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:50,920
I wanted to win the bet,too,and,uh...

716
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:55,380
I couldn't.

717
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:58,620
Just because i lost doesn't mean
you shouldn't take my advice.

718
00:41:58,650 --> 00:41:59,950
Yeah,yeah,hush.

719
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:03,480
I'm serious,man. Go for it.

720
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,060
What's he talking about?

721
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,770
Nothing.

722
