1
00:00:04,047 --> 00:00:06,380
The red light's on.
That means we're ready?

2
00:00:06,842 --> 00:00:07,751
Yes.

3
00:00:08,537 --> 00:00:09,487
Would you

4
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:12,428
tell us why and how
a psychic becomes a CBI agent?

5
00:00:12,814 --> 00:00:14,104
I'm not a psychic.

6
00:00:14,505 --> 00:00:15,889
No such things as psychics.

7
00:00:16,098 --> 00:00:17,674
And he's not a CBI agent.

8
00:00:17,799 --> 00:00:19,810
He's a consultant.
Big difference.

9
00:00:20,883 --> 00:00:23,606
"No such thing as psychics."
Care to elaborate?

10
00:00:30,434 --> 00:00:32,288
No, not particularly.

11
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,744
This is not a good idea.

12
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,362
It's not a good idea.

13
00:00:42,138 --> 00:00:44,251
Maybe we'll come back to that later.

14
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,170
How do your cases usually start?

15
00:00:47,274 --> 00:00:49,495
A case begins
with us getting a phone call

16
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,884
from the AG's office
to lead an investigation.

17
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:54,961
In the St. Clare homicide,
the local DA wanted us on it

18
00:00:55,086 --> 00:00:57,190
because there were
political issues involved.

19
00:00:57,315 --> 00:01:00,738
And how did the local cops feel
about your team coming in?

20
00:01:01,883 --> 00:01:03,470
We get along extremely well

21
00:01:03,595 --> 00:01:06,001
with our local partners
in law enforcement.

22
00:01:06,895 --> 00:01:09,340
My people can
handle this, no problem.

23
00:01:09,751 --> 00:01:12,001
California Bureau
of Interference is what you are.

24
00:01:12,126 --> 00:01:14,295
- Interference? That's witty.
- Stay out of this.

25
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,638
I'm sure
you're competent, Chief Donner.

26
00:01:16,763 --> 00:01:18,643
We're following the AG's orders.

27
00:01:18,768 --> 00:01:19,948
Screw the AG.

28
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:23,541
This case is going to be in the news,
and you're spotlight hogs. That's all.

29
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,633
- I assure you...
- Don't waste your time.

30
00:01:25,758 --> 00:01:28,085
His anger runs deeper
than you can reach.

31
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:31,215
Don't start trouble here.
It's the last thing we need.

32
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,948
The victim is Martha St. Clare, 34.

33
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,313
Media relations coordinator
for the mayor.

34
00:01:36,438 --> 00:01:39,473
Mayor was here to break ground
dug up her PR flack instead.

35
00:01:40,902 --> 00:01:43,185
Victim was stabbed in the chest,
but there's no blood.

36
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:45,229
- Killed elsewhere.
- Home.

37
00:01:46,143 --> 00:01:48,983
Her nails and hair's are done.
She doesn't wear sweatpants

38
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:50,443
anywhere but at home.

39
00:01:50,919 --> 00:01:52,403
Have Van Pelt check it out.

40
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,881
The killer wanted the body
to be discovered here

41
00:01:58,006 --> 00:01:59,744
under the glare of the cameras.

42
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:02,037
And likely came here
to watch the fuss.

43
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:03,083
Likely.

44
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:06,751
Maybe the camera crews caught something.
We'll need to have them look into it.

45
00:02:08,809 --> 00:02:10,254
There's bruises on her arms.

46
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:13,215
Looks like something
was ripped off her neck.

47
00:02:13,511 --> 00:02:14,717
Is he sniffing her?

48
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,304
You pay him to sniff people?

49
00:02:18,573 --> 00:02:19,430
Apparently.

50
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:21,182
She's been smoking.

51
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,919
The patch on her arm
says she was trying to quit.

52
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:27,779
- So under stress of late.
- Well, case closed.

53
00:02:28,551 --> 00:02:30,232
Stress got a knife and stabbed her.

54
00:02:30,635 --> 00:02:31,724
He's on a roll.

55
00:02:32,351 --> 00:02:33,548
You're on a roll.

56
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:36,476
Cheap soap.
Unironed shirt. Stomach pains.

57
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:39,166
Recent loss of weight.
I'm gonna take a wild guess here.

58
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,416
You're not well.
'cause you're living in a motel

59
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:44,914
'cause your wife knows about your affair
with that you don't even care for.

60
00:02:45,339 --> 00:02:48,709
You're a seething mass
of self-loathing and understandably so.

61
00:02:50,098 --> 00:02:52,671
- You son of a bitch!
- Chief Donner, my apologies.

62
00:02:53,142 --> 00:02:54,840
He was completely out of line.

63
00:02:55,154 --> 00:02:57,554
Let's just get back
to the body, sir?

65
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:14,259
We've closed more cases
than any other unit in the CBI.

66
00:03:14,482 --> 00:03:17,598
But we don't keep score that way.
It's not a contest.

67
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:19,757
And you also

68
00:03:20,425 --> 00:03:23,575
lead in the number
of complaints and lawsuits filed.

69
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,209
Hold it.

70
00:03:29,312 --> 00:03:31,223
I thought we had an agreement.

71
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:34,009
Brenda, a word.

72
00:03:40,258 --> 00:03:42,012
Jane's right.
This isn't a good idea.

73
00:03:42,378 --> 00:03:44,275
This was supposed
to be positive coverage.

74
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,516
It is! It will be.

75
00:03:45,753 --> 00:03:48,523
If we're open and honest,
the positivity follows.

76
00:03:48,648 --> 00:03:49,770
That's PR 101.

77
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,626
We're trying to solve
a woman's murder here, Brenda.

78
00:03:52,821 --> 00:03:54,905
We don't have time to waste on PR.

79
00:03:55,886 --> 00:03:58,112
We have been crucified by the media

80
00:03:58,237 --> 00:04:00,573
ever since Bosco was killed here.

81
00:04:01,482 --> 00:04:04,785
When KTQZ asked me
for access, I jumped at it,

82
00:04:05,809 --> 00:04:07,709
and the deputy AG concurred.

83
00:04:08,686 --> 00:04:10,083
Who is this guy anyway?

84
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,668
Totally legit
TV investigative reporter.

85
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:16,511
Mike Brewster. He has been covering
the central valley for years.

86
00:04:18,205 --> 00:04:20,009
We need this, Teresa.
Please.

87
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,460
- Work with us.
- He stays out of my way.

88
00:04:22,886 --> 00:04:25,931
He can film here,
but not out in the field.

89
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,160
Thank you.

90
00:04:27,588 --> 00:04:29,138
Seriously, thank you.

91
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,977
You won't be sorry.

92
00:04:31,102 --> 00:04:33,883
And it's a two-way street.
If there's anything I can do...

93
00:04:34,619 --> 00:04:35,917
There is one thing.

94
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:39,239
This is the footage
we grabbed of the groundbreaking.

95
00:04:39,364 --> 00:04:40,446
That's the Mayor.

96
00:04:40,936 --> 00:04:42,486
Melba Walker Shannon.

97
00:04:43,179 --> 00:04:45,784
She plays up the folksy image,
but she can be tough as nails.

98
00:04:46,258 --> 00:04:47,308
Nice shoes.

99
00:04:47,859 --> 00:04:49,241
- Chip?
- No, thanks.

100
00:04:49,366 --> 00:04:51,900
- Who's the rich guy next to the mayor?
- Heaton Krupp.

101
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:53,417
The private developer.

102
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:55,252
Off the record, a prize jerk.

103
00:04:55,571 --> 00:04:56,754
Who are those people?

104
00:04:57,107 --> 00:04:59,506
Tree huggers.
The project's going up on the edge

105
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:02,083
- of some reclaimed land.
- Means protected wildlands.

106
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:03,558
You say "potato."

107
00:05:04,081 --> 00:05:05,956
You have any other footage
of the crowds?

108
00:05:06,081 --> 00:05:08,776
Other networks might,
but gaining access can be tricky.

109
00:05:08,901 --> 00:05:10,990
It'd be good to get
a different perspective.

110
00:05:11,115 --> 00:05:13,145
- See if you can get the footage.
- You got it.

111
00:05:13,565 --> 00:05:16,315
That's Wilson Fonteneau,
the mayor's flunky,

112
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:19,039
and here comes the money shot.

113
00:05:37,205 --> 00:05:38,777
These are from the victim's home.

114
00:05:38,902 --> 00:05:42,299
The only thing that seemed to be missing
was the victim's laptop.

115
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:45,552
- The murderer probably took it.
- Check out this necklace.

116
00:05:48,677 --> 00:05:51,809
It looks like she wore it a lot.
It could have made the mark on her neck?

117
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:55,229
Could be. When you go to the apartment,
do a targeted search.

118
00:05:55,704 --> 00:05:57,254
The necklace is long gone.

119
00:05:57,379 --> 00:05:59,441
My guess, the killer
made a souvenir of it.

120
00:05:59,764 --> 00:06:00,673
Go.

121
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,036
- Where we going?
- Mayor's office.

122
00:06:06,829 --> 00:06:09,281
I don't have any problem
being in charge, no.

123
00:06:10,781 --> 00:06:14,408
Maybe at first for a while,
as a woman, it was a challenge,

124
00:06:15,223 --> 00:06:17,192
but the demands
of the job take over.

125
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,011
Tell me about your weekends.

126
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:22,882
You want to know
what I do on my weekends?

127
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,264
Why do you want to know that?

128
00:06:27,461 --> 00:06:30,447
I have no problem having a life,
if that's what you mean.

129
00:06:30,872 --> 00:06:33,944
I don't know why anybody
would say otherwise. If they do

130
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,519
say otherwise.

131
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,139
I'm sorry.

132
00:06:37,535 --> 00:06:39,189
What were we talking about?

133
00:06:48,352 --> 00:06:50,951
Sorry for the delay.
The mayor's was in a meeting.

134
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,327
It's been a crazy day.

135
00:06:52,766 --> 00:06:55,366
- Can I help you?
- No, I'm fine. Thanks.

136
00:06:55,852 --> 00:06:56,898
Mr. Fonteneau

137
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,545
did you work closely
with Martha St. Clare?

138
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,120
For 16 months.

139
00:07:01,665 --> 00:07:03,088
Martha hired me, actually.

140
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,429
We noticed in a lot
of recent photographs

141
00:07:05,554 --> 00:07:08,610
that she had a necklace
on with a beautiful stone.

142
00:07:08,735 --> 00:07:11,957
Yes, a topaz,
I think It was her birthstone.

143
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,712
She got it on Christmas
and never took it off.

144
00:07:14,837 --> 00:07:16,601
Do you know who gave it to her?

145
00:07:16,726 --> 00:07:18,729
She had a lot of meetings,
even on weekends.

146
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,857
Business interests,
community groups, book club.

147
00:07:22,277 --> 00:07:26,070
Tomorrow is a big day. She has a star
and 3 exclamation marks at 11:00.

148
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,699
She scheduled a briefing
with the city council.

149
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:31,825
On what subject?

150
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:34,661
I don't know, to be honest.
The mayor will know.

151
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:36,789
Was she dating anyone?

152
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,071
A social life, Martha?

153
00:07:39,988 --> 00:07:41,388
No, she had a cat.

154
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:44,505
But it died.

155
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:45,881
Right.

156
00:07:46,623 --> 00:07:48,505
Excuse me.
Are you the CBI Agents?

157
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:51,902
- Thank you for seeing us.
- Happy to help, call me Melba.

158
00:07:52,248 --> 00:07:53,430
Like the toast?

159
00:07:54,101 --> 00:07:55,565
Just like. This way.

160
00:08:01,745 --> 00:08:04,942
Can you tell us
about your construction project?

161
00:08:05,315 --> 00:08:08,904
It's the Granton Complex, yes.
We are very proud of it.

162
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:12,354
It's office
and retail space plus housing

163
00:08:12,584 --> 00:08:15,058
all built
with the latest green technology.

164
00:08:15,577 --> 00:08:17,496
And what was Martha's involvement?

165
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,500
None, really. She...

166
00:08:21,411 --> 00:08:23,564
She was my media liaison.

167
00:08:23,689 --> 00:08:25,838
She was not engaged
in policy issues.

168
00:08:27,489 --> 00:08:30,518
Then what was she gonna talk
about at city council tomorrow?

169
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:35,139
A press junket.
It was river rafting, I believe.

170
00:08:35,501 --> 00:08:37,516
Chief Donner says
your office has received

171
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,643
threats
from environmental activists.

172
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,208
Activists?
No, they're terrorists.

173
00:08:42,684 --> 00:08:44,773
They burned down vacation condos.

174
00:08:45,352 --> 00:08:48,064
They destroyed luxury car lots
just one town over.

175
00:08:48,189 --> 00:08:50,821
They're led by a madman,
and he calls himself Jasper.

176
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,365
Excuse me.

177
00:08:55,816 --> 00:08:57,857
Wilson, anything else can wait.

178
00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:05,869
- The threats?
- Yes.

179
00:09:10,443 --> 00:09:13,782
<i>The Granton development
is an abomination.</i>

180
00:09:14,756 --> 00:09:18,188
<i>A hundred acres
of pristine wildlands razed,</i>

181
00:09:18,621 --> 00:09:22,046
<i>An entire ecosystem endangered.
It must stop.</i>

182
00:09:23,006 --> 00:09:25,623
<i>It will stop,
no matter what needs to be done.</i>

183
00:09:26,965 --> 00:09:28,365
<i>My name is Jasper,</i>

184
00:09:29,532 --> 00:09:30,832
<i>and I am legion.</i>

185
00:09:32,691 --> 00:09:33,697
Come on.

186
00:09:34,629 --> 00:09:36,533
"I am legion."
That's just silly.

187
00:09:36,828 --> 00:09:37,737
Silly?

188
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,802
- He murdered Martha.
- You assume.

189
00:09:40,927 --> 00:09:41,927
Yes, I do.

190
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,393
The body was buried
at the site, for God's sake.

191
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:46,210
That is a clear message, isn't it?

192
00:09:47,018 --> 00:09:47,927
Melba,

193
00:09:48,936 --> 00:09:51,590
why would he kill Martha
and not kill you?

194
00:09:51,929 --> 00:09:54,028
It'd be a bigger publicity coup.

195
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,844
Excuse me?

196
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:58,722
What Mr. Jane
is trying to ask is whether

197
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:02,290
there was somebody
with a personal grudge against Martha.

198
00:10:04,765 --> 00:10:06,215
She was a lovely...

199
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:08,306
was a lovely person.

200
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,067
Why did you dislike her so much?

201
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,033
I didn't dislike Martha.

202
00:10:13,189 --> 00:10:15,739
Why would I employ someone
that I don't like?

203
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:17,494
Good question.
When you said it,

204
00:10:17,619 --> 00:10:20,077
your jaw tensed and your eyes
went empty like a cobra.

205
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:22,157
- Wilson!
- I'm not saying you killed her.

206
00:10:22,282 --> 00:10:24,164
But that you're relieved
that she's dead.

207
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,959
- These people will be leaving.
- I like the way you say that,

208
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:30,045
Melba-like-the-toast, so tough
and commanding. Now, listen.

209
00:10:30,453 --> 00:10:33,590
We are state law enforcement,
and we leave when we want.

210
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,851
- Thank you, ma'am.
- She wants to leave.

211
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,589
See yah.

212
00:10:44,297 --> 00:10:45,443
You blew my cool.

213
00:10:45,568 --> 00:10:47,686
I swear, sometimes
you need medication.

214
00:10:47,811 --> 00:10:49,453
Like you've got ADD or something.

215
00:10:49,578 --> 00:10:52,063
<i>A, I'm not so sure
that ADD even exists,</i>

216
00:10:52,188 --> 00:10:54,119
<i>and B,
I was winding her up for a reason.</i>

217
00:10:54,244 --> 00:10:55,936
- Which is?
- A diversion.

218
00:10:56,061 --> 00:10:58,388
The message the aide brought in
made her nervous.

219
00:10:58,513 --> 00:11:01,446
- You're stealing now?
- Let's just call it purloining.

220
00:11:01,571 --> 00:11:03,111
- What does it say?
- It says

221
00:11:03,236 --> 00:11:05,982
"your 3:00 meeting
has now been moved to 3:15."

222
00:11:06,107 --> 00:11:08,917
I'm just kidding.
It says, "9-1-1. Call now.

223
00:11:09,042 --> 00:11:12,212
"Urgent. About Martha."
From Heaton Krupp.

224
00:11:13,049 --> 00:11:15,083
The developer
of the Granton project.

225
00:11:19,186 --> 00:11:20,917
Do you enjoy police work?

226
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:27,886
Patrick?

227
00:11:29,054 --> 00:11:30,504
Yeah, I'm thinking.

228
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:33,525
Yes and no.

229
00:11:34,853 --> 00:11:36,153
Yeah, sometimes.

230
00:11:36,468 --> 00:11:37,571
Sometimes not.

231
00:11:38,624 --> 00:11:39,757
Forget it, Steve.

232
00:11:41,228 --> 00:11:43,478
Why do you so dislike being filmed?

233
00:11:46,549 --> 00:11:48,417
'Cause you're stealing my soul.

234
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,127
So I called the mayor.

235
00:11:52,354 --> 00:11:53,263
So what?

236
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:56,272
I'm building
a $20 million complex in her town.

237
00:11:56,397 --> 00:11:58,594
- I call her a lot.
- About ms. St. Clare?

238
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:01,053
About when I can
start construction again.

239
00:12:01,743 --> 00:12:03,597
This is costing me a lot of dollars.

240
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:05,307
It cost Ms. St. Clare a lot more.

241
00:12:06,012 --> 00:12:07,225
I'm sorry about that.

242
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,020
I am. There's nothing I can do.

243
00:12:11,788 --> 00:12:14,941
- Martha would've wanted us to go on.
- You knew her well to know that?

244
00:12:15,223 --> 00:12:17,110
You're right. I'm being pious.

245
00:12:17,767 --> 00:12:19,738
Maybe Martha
would've said, screw it.

246
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,573
I knew her not very well.

247
00:12:21,802 --> 00:12:22,711
Really?

248
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:26,202
We got her cell phone records,
and you called her several times.

249
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:28,121
What you wanted
to talk about so urgently?

250
00:12:28,406 --> 00:12:30,519
Seems I should get my lawyer.

251
00:12:30,644 --> 00:12:31,804
Sure.

252
00:12:31,929 --> 00:12:33,752
Tell him to bring all your permits.

253
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,124
- Why?
- Why not?

254
00:12:35,249 --> 00:12:36,994
Make sure this stays on crime scene.

255
00:12:37,119 --> 00:12:38,548
Keep everyone out.

256
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,666
- Could take weeks.
- See...

257
00:12:41,581 --> 00:12:43,133
We were talking about money.

258
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,639
$10 million in public funds
was to be released

259
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:46,932
when we broke ground.

260
00:12:47,271 --> 00:12:48,768
Then I heard rumors that St. Clare

261
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,269
was planning to tell the city council
to withhold them.

262
00:12:51,525 --> 00:12:53,460
- Why?
- I don't know!

263
00:12:54,237 --> 00:12:55,607
I was trying to find out.

264
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,943
But St. Clare was killed
before she could talk.

265
00:12:58,254 --> 00:13:00,232
The $10 million
will come to you after all.

266
00:13:00,357 --> 00:13:02,390
Are you trying to lay this on me?

267
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,657
Because you're messing
with the wrong guy!

268
00:13:04,782 --> 00:13:07,244
- Not officers, Agents.
- That's quite a temper.

269
00:13:08,906 --> 00:13:09,856
Look out!

270
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,169
Get down, get down!
Get on the floor!

271
00:13:16,788 --> 00:13:17,546
Help!

272
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:21,664
I got the door! Go!

273
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:23,677
I got the door!

274
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:32,686
I got you.

275
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,374


276
00:14:04,609 --> 00:14:07,298
This was done by someone
who knew what he or she was doing.

277
00:14:07,423 --> 00:14:08,723
Crackpot Jasper.

278
00:14:09,176 --> 00:14:10,390
He's a terrorist,

279
00:14:10,881 --> 00:14:13,465
And you ain't doing jack
to catch him, chief.

280
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:16,945
I'm in charge of the town
of Salter, Mr. Krupp,

281
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:18,690
not the outlying areas.

282
00:14:20,611 --> 00:14:22,910
Jasper's never launched
an attack here in town before.

283
00:14:23,035 --> 00:14:25,335
- Until now.
- Check this out.

284
00:14:34,604 --> 00:14:37,654
Apparently, this is the same tag
that Jasper used.

285
00:14:41,911 --> 00:14:43,829
- It's good just here?
- That's great.

286
00:14:44,689 --> 00:14:47,302
I've been in fires before.
I worked with the,

287
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:50,128
Arson squad
in San Diego for a couple years,

288
00:14:50,426 --> 00:14:52,551
I'm not unfamiliar with the issues.

289
00:14:52,904 --> 00:14:54,506
It's never pleasant, though.

290
00:14:56,575 --> 00:14:59,272
When you're in it,
it's there's no time to think.

291
00:15:00,304 --> 00:15:01,873
But afterwards, well...

292
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:06,989
It can make you think.

293
00:15:08,216 --> 00:15:09,282
There was a...

294
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,150
There was a moment there where,

295
00:15:18,048 --> 00:15:19,514
Yeah, makes you think.

296
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,869
It's a gift, isn't it?

297
00:15:24,464 --> 00:15:25,373
Life.

298
00:15:27,311 --> 00:15:29,186
You should be grateful for it...

299
00:15:30,495 --> 00:15:31,884
Make the most of it.

300
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,432
Let's catch this guy
before he kills again.

301
00:15:34,737 --> 00:15:36,309
He hasn't killed anyone yet.

302
00:15:36,689 --> 00:15:38,239
Not Martha St. Clare?

303
00:15:38,516 --> 00:15:40,406
She was about
to stall the development.

304
00:15:40,531 --> 00:15:42,396
That what Jasper wants.
So why kill her?

305
00:15:42,521 --> 00:15:44,801
Maybe he didn't know
Martha's intentions.

306
00:15:44,926 --> 00:15:48,655
But the mayor must have known.
Let's go see her.

307
00:15:48,824 --> 00:15:51,092
You guys look
into this Jasper character.

308
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:52,742
Don't bother.
He's a red herring.

309
00:15:53,057 --> 00:15:54,411
What does that mean?

310
00:15:54,728 --> 00:15:58,458
A red herring is what you look
in to regardless of what Jane tells you.

311
00:15:58,957 --> 00:16:00,231
Anything on the videos?

312
00:16:00,356 --> 00:16:03,082
They've been throwing up hurdles.
About first amendment issues.

313
00:16:03,207 --> 00:16:05,435
Get the footage. I'm tired
of their excuses.

314
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,549
We ID somebody in the crowd,.

315
00:16:07,862 --> 00:16:08,862
Yes, boss.

316
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,462
Why am I a detective?
Why are you a reporter?

317
00:16:11,587 --> 00:16:14,024
- What?
- Why are you making this documentary?

318
00:16:14,294 --> 00:16:17,894
- It's a fresh perspective on police.
- No, what's in it for you?

319
00:16:19,066 --> 00:16:21,470
Scoring this exclusive
is a good way to get noticed.

320
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,038
So you're ambitious.
How long you do this job?

321
00:16:24,163 --> 00:16:25,832
- About eight years.
- Anchor?

322
00:16:25,957 --> 00:16:27,022
Mostly fieldwork.

323
00:16:27,147 --> 00:16:29,793
So you're ambitious,
but you haven't gotten very far.

324
00:16:31,707 --> 00:16:32,991
I guess that's about it.

325
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,951
You don't like
being asked questions?

326
00:16:35,242 --> 00:16:37,871
The team as a whole
seems to have a problem with that.

327
00:16:38,577 --> 00:16:40,473
- Is that a question?
- Mike,

328
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,917
- if I can interrupt here?
- Yeah.

329
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:45,816
- We're clear.
- There's coffee in the kitchen.

330
00:16:45,941 --> 00:16:47,085
I'm so sorry.

331
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,270
- Agent Cho?
- Yeah?

332
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,605
It is the specific request
of the deputy A.G.

333
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,931
that your unit cooperate
fully with the media.

334
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,502
What's your point?

335
00:17:12,561 --> 00:17:14,412
Mayor Shannon, we need to talk.

336
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:17,013
I have a meeting.
Please make it fast.

337
00:17:17,138 --> 00:17:19,738
How big was your bribe
from Heaton Krupp?

338
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:24,167
That is an outrageous slander.

339
00:17:24,596 --> 00:17:26,663
You sold your approval
of the Granton project.

340
00:17:26,788 --> 00:17:28,929
Martha found out.
She was gonna reveal it

341
00:17:29,054 --> 00:17:31,666
At the city council meeting,
which you said was gonna be about

342
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,134
river rafting.

343
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,636
River rafting

344
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,434
from where did you pull that?

345
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:39,063
You better have
really good personal lawyers.

346
00:17:39,339 --> 00:17:40,316
If you pursue

347
00:17:40,441 --> 00:17:43,978
this absurd line of harassment,
I will hang you by your heels.

348
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,523
Did you get a slice, too,
or are you strictly wage labor?

349
00:17:47,051 --> 00:17:48,950
Your superiors will
hear from our lawyers.

350
00:17:49,075 --> 00:17:51,718
Don't bother with lawyers.
It's such a waste of taxpayer dollars.

351
00:17:52,108 --> 00:17:55,239
- Confess. You'll feel a lot better.
- In actuality, you have no proof

352
00:17:55,364 --> 00:17:57,992
- of this so-called bribery.
- None at all.

353
00:17:59,842 --> 00:18:02,258
Are all CBI Agents this incompetent?

354
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:05,333
Have you even bothered to check
her lover as a suspect?

355
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,360
You say it was Jasper.
Now it's the lover.

356
00:18:07,485 --> 00:18:08,834
You gonna make up your mind?

357
00:18:08,959 --> 00:18:11,175
What lover? We understood
she had no social life.

358
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,785
I didn't know she did.

359
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:16,094
She did and competent
police would have known that.

360
00:18:16,511 --> 00:18:18,178
Why didn't you tell us this earlier?

361
00:18:18,845 --> 00:18:22,101
Why don't I just do your job
for you? How would that be?

362
00:18:22,512 --> 00:18:25,879
- Just please arrest her or something.
- Nothing to hold her on.

363
00:18:31,725 --> 00:18:33,559
I'm the rookie on the team.

364
00:18:34,709 --> 00:18:35,788
Been here...

365
00:18:36,436 --> 00:18:37,593
18 months now.

366
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:42,097
It's hard work, but...

367
00:18:42,761 --> 00:18:45,252
this has been my dream
ever since I was a kid.

368
00:18:45,852 --> 00:18:47,020
to be a Detective.

369
00:18:47,892 --> 00:18:49,832
And what's been
the most surprising thing

370
00:18:49,957 --> 00:18:52,160
you've learned
about this job you do?

371
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,418
I've...

372
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:59,444
learned a lot about myself...

373
00:19:00,631 --> 00:19:02,833
As well as about other people...

374
00:19:04,773 --> 00:19:07,363
stuff I wish
I didn't know sometimes.

375
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,923
Stuff like...

376
00:19:11,206 --> 00:19:14,063
Why people do bad things
to one another.

377
00:19:15,235 --> 00:19:17,223
It's mainly because of secrets.

378
00:19:18,832 --> 00:19:21,302
Trying to hide the truth
chips away at your spirit.

379
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:24,537
Secrets... ruin relationships.

380
00:19:25,468 --> 00:19:27,505
We got the footage
from every news station

381
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:30,680
covering the groundbreaking ceremony.
Apparently, threats work.

382
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:33,213
These are 2 separate
vantage points of the mayor,

383
00:19:33,524 --> 00:19:35,264
and these are feeds of the crowd.

384
00:19:36,053 --> 00:19:37,601
There... that guy.

385
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:40,178
Can you narrow it down for us?
There's 50 guys there.

386
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:43,043
The guy in the crowd there.
After the mayor digs up the victim.

387
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:46,392
He certainly doesn't look like
he fits in. That's bold.

388
00:19:48,066 --> 00:19:50,177
- A Jasper acolyte.
- Or the man himself.

389
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:53,069
Get with the local P.D.
See if they can identify him.

390
00:19:55,926 --> 00:19:58,141
- What is it?
- Nothing. Just hungry.

391
00:20:06,862 --> 00:20:08,590
We went back
to St. Clare's apartment,

392
00:20:08,715 --> 00:20:10,917
in her closet, we saw
that some of her work shirts,

393
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:13,431
- button on the right.
- Yeah, and not her size.

394
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,598
So the mayor was right.
She did have a lover.

395
00:20:15,723 --> 00:20:18,966
Of course. That necklace she wore
was obviously a romantic gift.

396
00:20:19,091 --> 00:20:20,862
She'd never spend
so much money on herself.

397
00:20:21,121 --> 00:20:23,663
Now you say so.
Very wise in hindsight.

398
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:27,099
It went without saying. It's so obvious
when people are in a relationship.

399
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,735
Impossible to hide,
try though they might.

400
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:33,677
She was a very attractive woman.
I would not be surprised

401
00:20:33,802 --> 00:20:35,209
if she had two lovers.

402
00:20:35,675 --> 00:20:37,861
There is nothing here.
I'm gonna go out for lunch.

403
00:20:40,203 --> 00:20:42,812
Turn that thing off,
or I will shove it down your throat.

404
00:20:43,231 --> 00:20:44,807
Let's take a walk, shall we?

405
00:20:45,174 --> 00:20:46,083
Come on.

406
00:20:57,732 --> 00:20:59,883
I know it hasn't been
the most pleasant experience

407
00:21:00,473 --> 00:21:01,843
having a camera crew here.

408
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,701
But you gotta cooperate--
deputy A.G.'s orders.

409
00:21:07,334 --> 00:21:08,555
So what's the deal?

410
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,103
I would think out of everybody, you'd be
the most comfortable with the cameras.

411
00:21:17,518 --> 00:21:21,313
Last time I was in front of a camera,
things didn't turn out so well.

412
00:21:24,528 --> 00:21:26,018
God, Jane, I'm sorry.

413
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,049
You don't need to be sorry...

414
00:21:29,283 --> 00:21:30,578
and you're right.

415
00:21:30,703 --> 00:21:33,463
There's no reason not to be
civil. I'm going to apologize.

416
00:21:40,212 --> 00:21:42,492
I'm sorry.
We didn't mean to be intrusive.

417
00:21:43,102 --> 00:21:44,867
I shouldn't have snapped at you.

418
00:21:44,992 --> 00:21:47,096
I'm sorry. I just... I don't like

419
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:48,669
feeling spied on.

420
00:21:49,347 --> 00:21:50,909
It's my own little neurosis.

421
00:21:51,362 --> 00:21:53,554
- You're just doing your job, right?
- Right.

422
00:21:54,052 --> 00:21:55,313
Let me buy you a taco.

423
00:21:55,917 --> 00:21:57,362
- Sure.
- I know you're in.

424
00:21:57,487 --> 00:21:59,407
- I am kind of hungry.
- That's the spirit.

425
00:21:59,532 --> 00:22:01,254
I know the perfect place.
Vamonos.

426
00:22:05,578 --> 00:22:06,789
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

427
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:11,192
- Mike.
- Thank you.

428
00:22:11,317 --> 00:22:12,226
Steve.

429
00:22:12,735 --> 00:22:14,415
So tell me about news gathering.

430
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,557
Did you get that?

432
00:22:38,872 --> 00:22:39,986
Keep moving.

433
00:22:45,068 --> 00:22:46,030
Let's go.

434
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:51,536
I don't know where we're going,
but I hope there's a bathroom.

435
00:22:53,295 --> 00:22:54,431
I am busting.

436
00:23:02,946 --> 00:23:05,109
Definitely Jasper.
The description of the van

437
00:23:05,234 --> 00:23:08,386
matches one seen near the condo fire
and the luxury car lot Jasper destroyed.

438
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:10,813
How long has Chief Donner
had this information?

439
00:23:10,938 --> 00:23:13,149
- Contact the local and the county P.D.
- On it.

440
00:23:13,274 --> 00:23:15,582
We got a hit on the Jasper associate
at the ceremony.

441
00:23:15,707 --> 00:23:18,395
Activists draw the line at kidnapping.
They gave this guy up fast.

442
00:23:18,616 --> 00:23:21,614
Bart Henrik. On his blog,
he calls himself a green warrior.

443
00:23:21,739 --> 00:23:24,074
He's been arrested several times
for inciting a riot,

444
00:23:24,199 --> 00:23:25,958
public disorder and vandalism.

445
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:28,086
- Go find him. Take Rigsby.
- You got it.

446
00:24:08,486 --> 00:24:10,020
I can see you mean business.

447
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:12,450
There's no need for firearms.
I'm not Harry Houdini.

448
00:24:13,026 --> 00:24:13,935
Quiet.

449
00:24:16,593 --> 00:24:17,577
Thank you.

450
00:24:19,672 --> 00:24:20,875
So you're Jasper.

451
00:24:22,888 --> 00:24:24,288
Well, I'm honored.

452
00:24:27,535 --> 00:24:29,938
Please don't say
you kidnapped me for ransom, because

453
00:24:30,063 --> 00:24:31,392
I doubt you'll get $50,

454
00:24:31,517 --> 00:24:33,546
- let alone save the whales.
- No ransom.

455
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,064
In actuality,
just a simple message...

456
00:24:36,573 --> 00:24:38,753
I did not kill Martha St. Clare

457
00:24:38,878 --> 00:24:41,270
And I didn't throw
that firebomb in Krupp's office.

458
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:44,315
And you... you are gonna
tell that to the police

459
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:45,650
and to the media.

460
00:24:46,261 --> 00:24:48,319
So you kidnapped me
to proclaim your innocence.

461
00:24:48,814 --> 00:24:50,373
Have you ever heard of a phone?

462
00:24:52,313 --> 00:24:53,222
I see.

463
00:24:54,128 --> 00:24:56,567
If you kidnap me,
and I pass on the message,

464
00:24:56,692 --> 00:24:59,149
then you get a blast of
that publicity that you love.

465
00:24:59,274 --> 00:25:02,995
If I am branded a killer, everything
I have fought for is discredited.

466
00:25:03,993 --> 00:25:07,152
People support me because I have
respect for all living things.

467
00:25:08,267 --> 00:25:10,479
Yes. But it's a good rule
of thumb to avoid

468
00:25:10,604 --> 00:25:12,929
doing things
that require you to wear a mask.

469
00:25:13,496 --> 00:25:15,531
And you're
such a handsome fellow, too.

470
00:25:19,114 --> 00:25:20,697
How'd you know I'm handsome?

471
00:25:22,411 --> 00:25:25,020
- I was just speaking figuratively.
- No, you weren't.

472
00:25:27,087 --> 00:25:29,631
- You know who I am.
- No, I have no idea.

473
00:25:31,034 --> 00:25:34,340
- Leave us and don't come back.
- He doesn't have to go anywhere.

474
00:25:34,465 --> 00:25:37,748
Will you listen to me? I have no idea...
You could be Elvis Presley.

475
00:25:37,873 --> 00:25:39,537
- How did you know?
- I don't know.

476
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:40,905
How did you...

477
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,300
Please don't do that.

478
00:25:54,131 --> 00:25:55,481
How did you know?

479
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:02,640
What's not to know?

480
00:26:04,224 --> 00:26:05,771
Your height, your body language,

481
00:26:07,321 --> 00:26:08,421
Your syntax.

482
00:26:09,048 --> 00:26:10,696
You said "in actuality."

483
00:26:10,821 --> 00:26:12,521
Who says "in actuality"?

484
00:26:18,023 --> 00:26:19,123
Very clever.

485
00:26:22,252 --> 00:26:23,878
So now we have a problem.

486
00:26:34,612 --> 00:26:36,612
Get that thing out of my face!

487
00:26:50,283 --> 00:26:52,160
Jasper hold our colleague.
Where are they?

488
00:26:52,285 --> 00:26:53,335
Jasper who?

489
00:26:53,607 --> 00:26:56,735
Did you know you can get more time
for kidnapping than murder?

490
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,799
That's crazy.

491
00:26:57,924 --> 00:27:00,826
Being an accessory after the fact
makes you just as guilty as Jasper.

492
00:27:05,147 --> 00:27:07,072
Jasper's avenging mother earth.
That's all.

493
00:27:07,197 --> 00:27:09,149
You know him well
to be sure of his motives.

494
00:27:09,274 --> 00:27:11,003
So well you can tell us where he is.

495
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:13,532
Even if I knew, which I don't,

496
00:27:13,863 --> 00:27:15,383
I would never betray Jasper.

497
00:27:15,727 --> 00:27:17,544
- "Never" is a big word.
- Try me.

498
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:20,079
What would Jane
want us to do in this situation, Cho?

499
00:27:20,204 --> 00:27:22,932
- With his life in jeopardy.
- You know what he'd want us to do.

500
00:27:25,895 --> 00:27:27,228
I guess we have to go...

501
00:27:27,495 --> 00:27:28,404
There.

502
00:27:33,729 --> 00:27:35,262
Let's call an ambulance.

503
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:37,989
Sure. They can set it fast,
and we can get back to questioning.

504
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:39,407
Wait, set what?

505
00:27:41,377 --> 00:27:43,703
Your arm, you broke it,
slipped on the stairs.

506
00:27:44,151 --> 00:27:45,830
You should be more careful, Henrik.

507
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:49,417
A bunch of people
saw me come in here fine.

508
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:51,460
A bunch of cops,
and I'm one of them.

509
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:52,878
I saw you fall.

510
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,798
And every cop in this building
will say exactly the same.

511
00:28:09,449 --> 00:28:12,146
A cabin in the Sierra Foothills,
10 miles northeast of Salter.

512
00:28:12,271 --> 00:28:13,271
Nice work.

513
00:28:16,343 --> 00:28:17,343
What to do?

514
00:28:17,922 --> 00:28:18,779
What to do?

515
00:28:19,295 --> 00:28:21,282
If I let you go now,
you'll rat me out.

516
00:28:21,586 --> 00:28:24,368
- If I may make a suggestion?
- No, you may not.

517
00:28:26,445 --> 00:28:27,997
Please, Wilson, I can help.

518
00:28:28,299 --> 00:28:29,899
I cannot go to prison.

519
00:28:32,013 --> 00:28:33,961
I need to finish my work.
Don't you see?

520
00:28:34,221 --> 00:28:36,213
I do. I see.
Your work is very important.

521
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,810
But what I don't understand, though,

522
00:28:39,945 --> 00:28:42,011
is why you were working
in the mayor's office.

523
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:44,597
Where better to study the enemy
than from within their very camp?

524
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:47,767
Did you know that the mayor
was taking bribes from Krupp?

525
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:48,935
Of course.

526
00:28:49,886 --> 00:28:51,563
Who do you think put Martha onto it?

527
00:28:52,292 --> 00:28:53,442
You told her.

528
00:28:55,298 --> 00:28:58,361
But why not expose the mayor yourself
or do it as Jasper?

529
00:28:58,825 --> 00:29:01,244
They would know that Jasper
was inside the mayor's office.

530
00:29:01,369 --> 00:29:03,219
They would soon suspect me.

531
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:06,813
I work in the shadows.
That's why I am still here,

532
00:29:06,938 --> 00:29:09,138
- still fighting.
- I understand.

533
00:29:10,369 --> 00:29:11,332
Let me help you.

534
00:29:12,002 --> 00:29:13,388
Don't try to play me.

535
00:29:14,298 --> 00:29:17,588
Don't go saying you won't tell on me
if I set you free, I know you will.

536
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:18,759
Wilson,

537
00:29:19,082 --> 00:29:22,676
I am not trying to play you.
I will not play you.

538
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:26,097
I understand and respect
your intelligence.

539
00:29:27,659 --> 00:29:28,759
Have a seat.

540
00:29:30,262 --> 00:29:31,519
Just take a moment.

541
00:29:48,741 --> 00:29:50,129
Wilson, look at me.

542
00:29:50,866 --> 00:29:52,116
I can help you.

543
00:29:55,651 --> 00:29:56,460
How?

544
00:29:57,557 --> 00:29:58,607
Look at me.

545
00:30:00,184 --> 00:30:02,299
You can see
that I'm telling the truth.

546
00:30:05,417 --> 00:30:06,967
I want what you want,

547
00:30:08,643 --> 00:30:09,962
peace and harmony.

548
00:30:11,996 --> 00:30:12,949
Peace...

549
00:30:14,583 --> 00:30:15,583
Quiet...

550
00:30:18,343 --> 00:30:19,343
It's easy.

551
00:30:20,638 --> 00:30:21,864
You can have it.

552
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,120
If you want it, you can have it.

553
00:30:30,111 --> 00:30:31,441
So peaceful.

554
00:30:34,507 --> 00:30:37,640
<i>This is Chief Donner
of the Salter Police Department!</i>

555
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:39,388
<i>You're surrounded.</i>

556
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:40,838
Stay cool.

557
00:30:53,002 --> 00:30:54,252
Just stay cool.

559
00:31:04,744 --> 00:31:06,280
- Clear!
- Clear!

560
00:31:06,784 --> 00:31:08,103
There's a trapdoor.

561
00:31:09,473 --> 00:31:11,123
- I got him.
- Lisbon?

562
00:31:11,506 --> 00:31:13,108
- Jane.
- I'm impressed.

563
00:31:13,431 --> 00:31:14,901
How did you find me out here?

564
00:31:15,026 --> 00:31:16,790
Right, because we're lost
without you?

565
00:31:16,915 --> 00:31:18,903
I wouldn't say that,
but I'm still impressed.

566
00:31:19,028 --> 00:31:20,169
Wait, don't move.

567
00:31:20,425 --> 00:31:24,046
They could have booby-trapped the place.
The bomb squad is to take a look at you.

568
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,750
You're kidding.

569
00:31:27,186 --> 00:31:30,641
I'm thankful and all that, but get me
out of here, I'll tell you the story.

570
00:31:30,766 --> 00:31:31,823
What story?

571
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,754
So we know who Jasper is.

572
00:31:41,879 --> 00:31:44,835
No trace of him.
Slipped right through the locals' hands.

573
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,758
He knows those woods a lot better.

574
00:31:46,883 --> 00:31:49,667
Jane, enough recovery time.
Tell us what Fonteneau said.

575
00:31:50,567 --> 00:31:52,720
He spouted
a lot of nonsense, denial.

576
00:31:52,845 --> 00:31:54,718
He took the job
in the mayor's office

577
00:31:54,843 --> 00:31:57,289
to plan targeted attacks
on new developments around town.

578
00:31:57,818 --> 00:31:59,875
He and St. Clare became lovers.

579
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,043
Secret boyfriend.

580
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:04,672
But when St. Clare found out
about Fonteneau's secret life as Jasper,

581
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,840
he killed her for it,
to keep her quiet.

582
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:09,089
I'll check on the warrant
for Fonteneau's place.

583
00:32:09,214 --> 00:32:11,545
Get everybody briefed,
suited up and ready to roll.

584
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:14,688
Look for St. Clare's necklace.
It was a gift from Fonteneau.

585
00:32:15,024 --> 00:32:17,834
My guess, he took it when he killed her.
We need it.

586
00:32:17,959 --> 00:32:21,309
You guys sit on the location
until the warrant comes in.

587
00:32:24,295 --> 00:32:27,395
- Chief Donner? It's Lisbon.
- I need some aspirin.

588
00:32:30,885 --> 00:32:33,617
I just wanted...
Could you hold on, chief?

589
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,452
That's enough.
We're done filming.

590
00:32:36,827 --> 00:32:39,282
Catching the bad guy would be
a great end of the show,

591
00:32:39,407 --> 00:32:41,205
make you guys look like superstars.

592
00:32:41,413 --> 00:32:43,806
It'd certainly make the deputy A.G.
very happy.

593
00:32:43,931 --> 00:32:44,840
True.

594
00:32:46,101 --> 00:32:47,756
All right.
You can film the bust,

595
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,134
but you have to do
exactly what I say.

596
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:52,761
- Deal.
- Meet me at Fonteneau's at 0600 hours.

597
00:32:54,437 --> 00:32:56,765
We're gonna need assistance
from your entry team again.

598
00:33:47,688 --> 00:33:48,626
What now?

599
00:33:49,037 --> 00:33:50,944
We set a perimeter
and wait for the warrant.

600
00:33:51,266 --> 00:33:53,405
There's a lot of this kind of stuff.

601
00:33:53,797 --> 00:33:55,238
Not too many car chases.

602
00:33:57,829 --> 00:34:00,315
Maybe we could, ask a few questions?

603
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,008
Sure. If you must.

604
00:34:13,815 --> 00:34:15,803
How did you come
to work with the CBI?

605
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,137
You know how.

606
00:34:17,543 --> 00:34:19,262
I need you to say it to the camera.

607
00:34:19,387 --> 00:34:20,474
I see. I got it.

608
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:30,611
I came to work with the CBI
after my wife and child were murdered.

609
00:34:43,242 --> 00:34:45,244
Have you ever
experienced loss like that?

610
00:34:46,377 --> 00:34:47,584
A loss of love?

611
00:34:51,552 --> 00:34:53,841
There's nothing more important
than love, is there?

612
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:56,398
We're talking about you.

613
00:35:00,922 --> 00:35:03,629
It can be very hard
when love goes away. It's like a...

614
00:35:04,344 --> 00:35:05,364
A betrayal,

615
00:35:07,374 --> 00:35:09,120
Almost like a violent act, right?

616
00:35:10,847 --> 00:35:11,756
Right?

617
00:35:13,555 --> 00:35:14,361
I guess.

618
00:35:15,629 --> 00:35:17,106
Why don't we go back to...

619
00:35:17,231 --> 00:35:19,836
When you give someone your heart
and they throw it aside,

620
00:35:20,078 --> 00:35:21,410
It's natural to be angry.

621
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:25,258
Especially when you've
come to rely on them,

622
00:35:26,535 --> 00:35:29,126
When your career is tied to theirs.

623
00:35:31,063 --> 00:35:33,630
- I don't know what...
- Show us what you got in your pockets.

624
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,527
- What?
- You heard me.

625
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:37,719
Why not?

626
00:35:39,915 --> 00:35:42,097
- Because you don't have the right.
- Okay.

627
00:35:45,483 --> 00:35:48,725
I tell you what you have in your pocket,
And you tell me if I'm right.

628
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:51,940
You have a blue topaz necklace
that you once gave to Martha

629
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:53,859
Martha St Clare
when you were lovers.

630
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:56,639
You took that necklace back
after you killed her.

631
00:35:56,915 --> 00:35:59,634
You were gonna plant it
in Fonteneau's house,

632
00:36:00,547 --> 00:36:02,833
prompted by my cunningly
brilliant ruse.

633
00:36:12,188 --> 00:36:13,188
That's it.

634
00:36:14,302 --> 00:36:16,986
- I don't know how that got in there.
- Please. Don't be so silly.

635
00:36:17,111 --> 00:36:18,322
Arrest him, Cho.

636
00:36:18,744 --> 00:36:21,689
Get on your knees.
Put your hands on your head.

637
00:36:21,814 --> 00:36:22,723
Now!

638
00:36:26,665 --> 00:36:27,574
Get up.

639
00:36:28,194 --> 00:36:29,272
That's for you.

640
00:36:30,638 --> 00:36:31,688
And this...

641
00:36:34,546 --> 00:36:35,526
Is for me.

642
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:42,222
Here it comes.

643
00:36:45,183 --> 00:36:46,859
- There.
- You looked away.

644
00:36:47,032 --> 00:36:50,246
Martha body hasn't been revealed,
and you looked away,

645
00:36:50,371 --> 00:36:53,062
you knew what was gonna happen,
because you buried

646
00:36:53,187 --> 00:36:56,338
that body at that building site
and you firebombed the trailer

647
00:36:56,506 --> 00:36:58,078
to try and frame Jasper.

648
00:36:58,348 --> 00:37:00,902
You're too clever, Mike,
you're just too clever.

649
00:37:02,824 --> 00:37:05,138
You spout a lot of theory,
but no legal proof.

650
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:07,945
You want legal proof?

651
00:37:08,432 --> 00:37:09,937
The lab reports came back.

652
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:12,813
They found traces of Martha's blood
in the trunk of your car.

653
00:37:15,895 --> 00:37:17,829
Do you want to tell us
what happened?

654
00:37:27,516 --> 00:37:29,403
Rumors said the mayor was dirty,

655
00:37:29,954 --> 00:37:31,336
But there was no proof.

656
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:33,912
I knew something was up.

657
00:37:34,037 --> 00:37:34,946
But...

658
00:37:35,844 --> 00:37:37,658
no matter how much I pushed her,

659
00:37:38,326 --> 00:37:39,908
Martha wouldn't say anything.

660
00:37:40,423 --> 00:37:41,258
Nothing.

661
00:37:43,675 --> 00:37:44,951
And last night...

662
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:48,715
<i>I was going through her computer,</i>

663
00:37:49,447 --> 00:37:51,082
<i>checking on some stuff, you know?</i>

664
00:37:52,839 --> 00:37:55,921
<i>I found this speech
she was preparing to give,</i>

665
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,109
<i>exposing the mayor as corrupt,</i>

666
00:37:59,879 --> 00:38:00,911
With proof...

667
00:38:01,183 --> 00:38:03,030
Facts and figures, the whole deal.

668
00:38:04,212 --> 00:38:06,239
<i>And she kept it
from me the whole time.</i>

669
00:38:06,661 --> 00:38:09,157
This is a story
that could have made my career.

670
00:38:10,493 --> 00:38:11,997
I have been waiting for a story

671
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:13,657
like this my whole life.

672
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:17,518
And she's mad
'cause I'm on her computer. Hello.

673
00:38:18,775 --> 00:38:19,733
<i>So she...</i>

674
00:38:21,979 --> 00:38:22,905
She said,

675
00:38:23,127 --> 00:38:25,344
she couldn't trust me anymore
and that it was over.

676
00:38:26,117 --> 00:38:27,387
<i>The argument escalated,</i>

677
00:38:28,317 --> 00:38:29,181
<i>and,</i>

678
00:38:29,602 --> 00:38:31,099
<i>I took my necklace back.</i>

679
00:38:31,759 --> 00:38:33,473
<i>And then she starts taunting me</i>

680
00:38:35,763 --> 00:38:37,439
<i>Implying that I don't have</i>

681
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:39,915
<i>what it takes to be
in the big leagues anyway,</i>

682
00:38:41,433 --> 00:38:42,819
<i>saying I'm a loser.</i>

683
00:38:43,492 --> 00:38:44,739
She's had enough?

684
00:38:45,682 --> 00:38:47,983
She's had enough? She has?

685
00:38:50,543 --> 00:38:52,319
I've had enough. Me!

686
00:39:02,927 --> 00:39:04,661
We'll take that as a confession.

687
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:08,095
<i>In a stunning revelation,
mayor Melba Walker Shannon</i>

688
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:11,099
<i>has been arrested by the D.A.
for corruption charges...</i>

689
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:13,607
<i>Stemming from the Granton
at Salter development.</i>

690
00:39:13,946 --> 00:39:16,561
<i>The accuser is her closest aide,
Wilson Fonteneau,</i>

691
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:18,605
<i>who agreed to testify against</i>

692
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:21,806
<i>the mayor in exchange for leniency
regarding his activities</i>

693
00:39:21,931 --> 00:39:23,944
<i>as eco-terrorist "Jasper."</i>

694
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:27,005
<i>This only the latest development
in a bizarre story</i>

695
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:30,117
<i>of murder and greed
that has captivated the Central Valley.</i>

696
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:32,953
I was enjoying that.

697
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:35,162
I hate how they overdramatize
everything.

698
00:39:35,287 --> 00:39:37,762
- Yeah, I hate that.
- "Captured the Central Valley."

699
00:39:37,887 --> 00:39:39,187
Give me a break.

700
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:40,349
Doughnuts.

701
00:39:41,328 --> 00:39:42,810
- Thanks.
- Ladies first.

702
00:39:43,467 --> 00:39:44,417
So, guys?

703
00:39:45,846 --> 00:39:47,334
I have something to say.

704
00:39:48,588 --> 00:39:50,721
We have something to say.

705
00:39:52,502 --> 00:39:54,670
Life's too short for dishonesty

706
00:39:55,368 --> 00:39:57,700
Van Pelt...
Grace and I are...

707
00:39:57,993 --> 00:39:58,812
Lovers.

708
00:40:02,855 --> 00:40:03,956
No, you're not.

709
00:40:05,797 --> 00:40:07,086
- Yes, we are.
- No,

710
00:40:07,391 --> 00:40:08,820
you are not lovers.

711
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,657
But we are, though.

712
00:40:11,063 --> 00:40:12,200
No, you're not,

713
00:40:12,477 --> 00:40:14,828
because a sexual relationship
between two fellow

714
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:16,747
bureau employees is strictly

715
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,277
against the rules.

716
00:40:18,402 --> 00:40:20,312
Which is why we kept it a secret.

717
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:22,797
But we don't want
to live a lie anymore.

718
00:40:24,695 --> 00:40:25,839
Come what may.

719
00:40:29,777 --> 00:40:33,513
- It's a big secret. Well-kept.
- You knew, but nobody else did.

720
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,891
- I knew. Half the building knows.
- They do not.

721
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:38,562
The only person that didn't know
is glaring at you right now.

722
00:40:38,687 --> 00:40:40,937
And now I have to do
something about it.

723
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,332
What are you gonna do?

724
00:40:42,777 --> 00:40:44,476
Yeah, what are you gonna do?

725
00:40:49,709 --> 00:40:50,839
I'm thinking.
