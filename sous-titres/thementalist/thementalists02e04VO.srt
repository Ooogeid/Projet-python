1
00:00:03,034 --> 00:00:05,801
(patrick) oh, it's lovely.
(teresa)
it's a crime scene.

2
00:00:06,867 --> 00:00:09,801
It's a lovely crime scene.
(wayne) hey. couple joggers
found our john doe

3
00:00:09,867 --> 00:00:12,333
On their morning run.
body's still pretty fresh,

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,834
So it must've
happened last night.

5
00:00:13,901 --> 00:00:17,101
No signs of an entry or exit
wound means cause was probably

6
00:00:17,134 --> 00:00:19,567
A blunt force trauma
to the head.
and they brought in
the grown-ups

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,801
Because they couldn't decide
whose sandbox it was?
right. body's right on
the city line.

8
00:00:22,834 --> 00:00:25,600
<i>the only thing
they can agree on</i>

9
00:00:25,634 --> 00:00:27,433
Is that it was
a carjacking gone wrong.

10
00:00:27,467 --> 00:00:30,367
Wallet, watch, wedding band--
everything gone.

11
00:00:30,433 --> 00:00:32,600
Oh, not everything.
killer would have been

12
00:00:32,634 --> 00:00:35,433
Very frustrated to not
be able to take this.

13
00:00:35,467 --> 00:00:38,467
Looks like a wheel.
motorcycle wheel.

14
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,101
I don't buy it as a carjacking.
maybe the murderer was

15
00:00:41,134 --> 00:00:43,034
Covering it up as one,
but if you're after

16
00:00:43,101 --> 00:00:45,567
Someone's car and valuables,
you grab and bolt.

17
00:00:45,634 --> 00:00:48,300
You don't waste time
taking off a cuff link.
right.

18
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:50,467
Carjacking--
a gunshot or a stab wound

19
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,967
Is more likely than a beating.
beating like this
takes time.

20
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:55,300
The murder
was personal.
no surprise there.

21
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:57,300
The haircut, the suit,
the cologne--

22
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:59,934
This man had enemies.
his cologne tells you
he had enemies?

23
00:00:59,967 --> 00:01:02,400
Sure.
okay, confrontional.

24
00:01:02,433 --> 00:01:04,901
Finishing touch
on a wardrobe that says,

25
00:01:04,934 --> 00:01:07,734
"pay attention.
show respect."

26
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:10,234
This was an extrovert
tough guy, a professional,

27
00:01:10,268 --> 00:01:12,834
A backroom politician
or a lawyer, a fixer,

28
00:01:12,867 --> 00:01:14,867
The type
that's good with people,

29
00:01:14,901 --> 00:01:17,801
Making people do things
they maybe don't want to do.

30
00:01:17,867 --> 00:01:21,534
<i>uh, what he is, is useless
until we know who he is.</i>

31
00:01:21,567 --> 00:01:25,134
Well,
i can do that, too.

32
00:01:25,201 --> 00:01:28,134
Oh, no, jane. i, uh, i checked.
the phone's not on him.

33
00:01:28,201 --> 00:01:30,234
The signal light's still on.
phone's in range.

34
00:01:30,268 --> 00:01:33,234
His assailant probably
threw it in the trees.

35
00:01:33,268 --> 00:01:36,600
What are you doing?
i'm making a call.

36
00:01:36,634 --> 00:01:39,168
But you don't have
the phone.
i have my voice.

37
00:01:39,234 --> 00:01:42,234
You still need the phone. want
to use the voice activation?

38
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:45,600
You need
its names and numbers.
there is one name
programmed into every phone,

39
00:01:45,634 --> 00:01:47,400
Particularly into one
belonging to a middle-aged man

40
00:01:47,433 --> 00:01:50,700
That was wearing
a wedding band.

41
00:01:50,734 --> 00:01:53,767
Home.

42
00:01:54,834 --> 00:01:57,634
<i>(cell phone rings)</i>

43
00:01:57,667 --> 00:01:59,067
(woman) hello?

44
00:01:59,101 --> 00:02:01,134
Hello.
this is patrick jane

45
00:02:01,168 --> 00:02:03,134
From the california bureau
of investigation.

46
00:02:03,168 --> 00:02:06,600
I was wondering if you knew
a man 6-feet tall, mid 40s,

47
00:02:06,634 --> 00:02:08,567
Salt and pepper hair,
gray custom-made suit,

48
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,700
Weighing about 192,
give or take?

49
00:02:11,767 --> 00:02:15,534
That's my husband
gordon hodge.
gordon hodge, hmm.

50
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,034
You said you're from cbi?
is something wrong?

51
00:02:18,101 --> 00:02:20,067
Uh, just a sec.

52
00:02:20,101 --> 00:02:22,134
It's for you.

53
00:02:22,168 --> 00:02:24,567
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

54
00:02:27,801 --> 00:02:29,967
Hello?

55
00:03:01,634 --> 00:03:04,101
(woman) i knew something
like this would happen,

56
00:03:04,134 --> 00:03:05,600
Sooner or later.

57
00:03:05,634 --> 00:03:06,600
(teresa)
well, was your husband

58
00:03:06,634 --> 00:03:08,734
Having some sort
of trouble lately?

59
00:03:08,767 --> 00:03:11,734
Gordon was a criminal attorney
with a very special practice.

60
00:03:11,767 --> 00:03:16,201
He had only one client--
the sinner saints.

61
00:03:16,268 --> 00:03:17,734
Bikers, are they?

62
00:03:17,767 --> 00:03:20,433
Yeah, they're one of the top
biker gangs in the state.

63
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:23,268
They run some legit businesses,
but mostly they're into

64
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,001
Drugs and prostitution,
low-rent protection rackets,

65
00:03:25,034 --> 00:03:26,867
That kind of thing.

66
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,201
For years, i begged him
to get out, but gordon said that

67
00:03:32,268 --> 00:03:37,400
A lawyer never abandons
his client. it's unethical.

68
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,967
It's what he always
called them--

69
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:42,834
Never "the gang,"
always "the client."

70
00:03:42,867 --> 00:03:45,433
When was the last time
you saw him?

71
00:03:45,467 --> 00:03:47,001
Yesterday morning,
before work.

72
00:03:47,034 --> 00:03:49,500
Gordon used to meet
these people at all hours--

73
00:03:49,534 --> 00:03:52,001
That's how they are.
so we didn't get worried

74
00:03:52,034 --> 00:03:54,001
When he didn't come home
last night.

75
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:56,201
Had he been acting
differently lately?

76
00:03:56,234 --> 00:03:59,134
He'd been more on edge
the last week or so.

77
00:03:59,168 --> 00:04:02,600
I think something happened
at work, but i'm not sure what.

78
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:04,934
Did you ask him
about it?

79
00:04:05,001 --> 00:04:08,168
No, never.
work was off-limits.

80
00:04:09,734 --> 00:04:12,001
He said it was boring.

81
00:04:12,034 --> 00:04:14,801
What was the real reason?

82
00:04:14,834 --> 00:04:18,634
Do you think he was ashamed,
or he sensed your shame?

83
00:04:18,667 --> 00:04:20,634
He wanted to protect us.

84
00:04:23,201 --> 00:04:25,201
Would his colleagues
at the office

85
00:04:25,234 --> 00:04:27,967
Have known
what was going on?
no.
he was a one-man shop.

86
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:29,967
Didn't even have
a secretary.

87
00:04:30,034 --> 00:04:32,967
Gordon didn't trust anyone
with his business.

88
00:04:33,034 --> 00:04:36,234
(teresa) any idea who might
have wanted to kill him?

89
00:04:36,268 --> 00:04:38,901
Well, you might want
to ask his client.

90
00:04:38,934 --> 00:04:41,534
He knew
all their secrets.

91
00:04:41,567 --> 00:04:43,901
He probably learned something
that he shouldn't have.

92
00:04:43,934 --> 00:04:46,767
Either of you ever meet
any of those scumbags?

93
00:04:46,867 --> 00:04:48,801
No.

94
00:04:48,867 --> 00:04:52,333
You two must be very torn--
living in such a beautiful home,

95
00:04:52,367 --> 00:04:55,634
Driving nice cars,
going to good schools,

96
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,067
All paid for
by dangerous criminals,

97
00:04:58,101 --> 00:05:01,201
Or, uh, "scumbags,"
as my colleague says.

98
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:04,734
Do i wish that gordon would've
defended civil rights leaders?

99
00:05:04,767 --> 00:05:07,001
Yes, of course!

100
00:05:07,067 --> 00:05:10,101
But he believed that everyone
had a constitutional right

101
00:05:10,134 --> 00:05:13,201
To have a good defense.
he had his principles.

102
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,467
Thank you for your time.

103
00:05:23,967 --> 00:05:26,934
Did you go to some interview
school i've never heard of?

104
00:05:26,967 --> 00:05:29,934
Next time, get the facts,
save the editorial.
yes, ma'am.

105
00:05:29,967 --> 00:05:32,967
I know.jane did it, too.
he's not a cbi agent.

106
00:05:33,034 --> 00:05:35,467
From you, i expect
professional standards.
yes, boss.

107
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,634
That was the captain
of the local c.h.i.p.s.

108
00:05:37,667 --> 00:05:40,300
Hodge's car was just fished out
of a lake about a mile from

109
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,634
The murder scene--
no good for prints.

110
00:05:41,667 --> 00:05:43,934
He said that two weeks back,
they busted hodge

111
00:05:43,967 --> 00:05:46,400
At a highway rest stop,
walking to his car with

112
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:49,201
2 ounces of coke and 2 ounces
of meth in his pockets.

113
00:05:49,268 --> 00:05:51,201
Nailed him with
felony possession...
nice.

114
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,268
Only the d.a.
dropped the charges.

115
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,801
There was some
unlawful search technicality.
either hodge
is a great lawyer...

116
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:59,634
Or the d.a. turned him
in exchange for dropping

117
00:05:59,667 --> 00:06:01,867
The charges--planned to
use him as an informant.
well, if the saints
found out--

118
00:06:01,934 --> 00:06:04,367
<i>yeah, they'd kill him.
they did know about the charges.</i>

119
00:06:04,433 --> 00:06:07,101
Their boss, von mcbride,
posted hodge's bail.
well, talk to your friends
at the d.a.

120
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:08,967
Find out what
the story is there.

121
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:11,268
Jane and i will go
talk to the sinner saints.
okay, be careful.

122
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,101
(rigsby) you want me to come
for backup?
uh, no. talk to forensics
about the car.

123
00:06:15,134 --> 00:06:17,967
Jane, let's go.
now, please?

124
00:06:18,001 --> 00:06:20,001
Come on.

125
00:06:35,967 --> 00:06:38,967
(engines revving)

126
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:45,934
(birds chirping)

127
00:06:46,001 --> 00:06:47,433
Beautiful, huh?

128
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,268
No, not really.
i fail to see the charm.

129
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,268
It's the glamour
of mobility.

130
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,967
That's why the girls
went for cain and not abel.

131
00:06:55,001 --> 00:06:57,734
Is that right?
yeah. nomads--
sexier than farmers.

132
00:06:57,801 --> 00:06:59,734
They have romance.

133
00:06:59,801 --> 00:07:01,234
(cell phone rings)

134
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,567
(ring)

135
00:07:02,634 --> 00:07:03,834
Lisbon.

136
00:07:03,867 --> 00:07:05,767
I spoke to my friend
in the d.a.'s office.

137
00:07:05,834 --> 00:07:07,767
They didn't make
a deal with hodge.

138
00:07:07,834 --> 00:07:09,300
They let him go 'cause
the case was less than ironclad,

139
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,268
And they've already lost too
many to hodge and the saints.

140
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,801
Last 10 years, they've beaten
the rap in over 50 cases--

141
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,700
Murder, rape, drug-trafficking.
they're bulletproof.

142
00:07:15,734 --> 00:07:17,001
Nobody's bulletproof.

143
00:07:17,034 --> 00:07:20,367
Well, my friend says
to stay away from them,

144
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,867
That they're bad news.

145
00:07:21,901 --> 00:07:23,367
Good, sound
lawyerly advice.

146
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,001
I'll take that
under advisement.

147
00:07:27,034 --> 00:07:29,001
You ready?

148
00:07:29,034 --> 00:07:32,001
Whew!

149
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,600
<i>(heavy metal music playing)</i>

150
00:07:40,201 --> 00:07:42,034
There's romance
for you.

151
00:07:44,034 --> 00:07:47,367
We're with the cbi.

152
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,500
We're looking
for von mcbride.

153
00:07:49,567 --> 00:07:52,767
(sets glass down)
not here, which is where
you need to be.

154
00:07:52,801 --> 00:07:54,834
Well, can you tell us
where he is?

155
00:07:54,901 --> 00:07:58,300
No. i cannot.

156
00:07:59,901 --> 00:08:02,934
Listen, we're here
for information,

157
00:08:02,967 --> 00:08:05,667
Not trouble, boys.

158
00:08:05,734 --> 00:08:07,667
Well, we've got
nothing to say.

159
00:08:07,734 --> 00:08:09,667
(teresa) i can take you in
if you want me to.

160
00:08:09,734 --> 00:08:13,667
I prefer to talk here.
(man) like i said,
there's nothing to talk about.

161
00:08:13,734 --> 00:08:15,934
We're not doing
anything illegal.

162
00:08:15,967 --> 00:08:17,500
Mr. mcbride?
(teresa) it was nice
talking to you.

163
00:08:17,567 --> 00:08:20,034
Your focus on
this pressing matter

164
00:08:20,101 --> 00:08:24,067
Suggests you're
the man in charge here.
yeah, well,
keep on walking, blondie.

165
00:08:24,101 --> 00:08:26,801
We just have a few questions
for you. it won't take long.

166
00:08:26,834 --> 00:08:29,801
Yeah, well, i'm sorry. i don't,
uh, talk to police officers

167
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:33,101
On the advice of my lawyer.

168
00:08:33,134 --> 00:08:34,433
Your lawyer's dead.

169
00:08:34,467 --> 00:08:38,534
Yeah, i heard that.
but his advice is still good.

170
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,534
(pool balls click)
means your business here
is done.

171
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:45,400
Oh. you don't want to know
who the informant is, then?

172
00:08:45,433 --> 00:08:48,400
What informant?
oh, i'm sorry.
forget i spoke.

173
00:08:48,433 --> 00:08:50,168
(patrick)
oh, i'm so sorry.

174
00:08:50,234 --> 00:08:53,600
You messing with me?
yeah, i'm messing with you.
there's no informant.

175
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:57,001
Come here.

176
00:08:57,034 --> 00:08:59,467
You touch him,
and i'll arrest you.

177
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,433
<i>i would love to see you
try and do that.</i>

178
00:09:02,467 --> 00:09:03,734
What's your name?

179
00:09:03,801 --> 00:09:05,834
Xander.

180
00:09:05,867 --> 00:09:08,600
Xander,
your threats are empty.

181
00:09:08,634 --> 00:09:10,500
She's a state agent.

182
00:09:10,534 --> 00:09:12,567
You're not gonna
lay a finger on her,

183
00:09:12,634 --> 00:09:14,567
And you know that,
so why play tough?

184
00:09:14,634 --> 00:09:16,901
W-where's that come from,
this need to intimidate?

185
00:09:16,967 --> 00:09:20,001
I'm a sadist,
and i bore easily.

186
00:09:20,034 --> 00:09:22,001
Oh. me, i see
a difficult childhood--

187
00:09:22,034 --> 00:09:24,600
Bad parenting,
a lot of torment.

188
00:09:24,634 --> 00:09:27,101
But i also see how
that suffering gave you

189
00:09:27,168 --> 00:09:30,101
Great powers of empathy
and a strong creative side,

190
00:09:30,168 --> 00:09:32,101
And those are the qualities

191
00:09:32,168 --> 00:09:34,600
You should try and nurture
in yourself.

192
00:09:34,667 --> 00:09:37,634
Not this brutish character
you try to hide behind.

193
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:40,867
Oh, that's xander,
all right.

194
00:09:40,901 --> 00:09:42,567
Full of empathy.

195
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:47,300
You guys want a drink?

196
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:50,367
Sure.

197
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,367
So what's this crap
about an informant?

198
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,367
How long have you know about
hodge's taste for coke and meth?

199
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,168
Couple years.

200
00:10:00,201 --> 00:10:03,201
Guy liked to party,
but he could still do his job.

201
00:10:03,234 --> 00:10:05,567
Couldn't have been too thrilled
when he got busted.

202
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,834
Case got dropped.

203
00:10:07,867 --> 00:10:09,467
Must've wondered why.

204
00:10:09,534 --> 00:10:11,700
Illegal search.

205
00:10:11,734 --> 00:10:12,967
Yeah.

206
00:10:13,034 --> 00:10:17,201
Either that or hodge,
uh, flipped on you.

207
00:10:17,234 --> 00:10:20,834
That son of a--
hold on a second, diamond.
he didn't flip.

208
00:10:20,867 --> 00:10:22,500
There is no informant.

209
00:10:22,534 --> 00:10:25,001
Where were you
last night?

210
00:10:25,034 --> 00:10:26,534
Right here.

211
00:10:26,567 --> 00:10:28,534
And i got
30 other brothers

212
00:10:28,567 --> 00:10:30,867
Who will vouch for me
and each other.

213
00:10:30,901 --> 00:10:33,934
Look, man,
none of my guys did this.

214
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:37,234
We loved gordon, man. he was
like a member of the club.

215
00:10:37,268 --> 00:10:40,234
You know, he couldn't ride
worth a damn.
no, he couldn't, huh?

216
00:10:40,268 --> 00:10:41,667
He tried, though.

217
00:10:41,734 --> 00:10:43,201
Who killed him?

218
00:10:43,234 --> 00:10:45,101
My guess?

219
00:10:45,134 --> 00:10:47,101
Probably some other
motorcycle club

220
00:10:47,134 --> 00:10:51,201
Looking to put us
out of business--

221
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:54,001
Chaos brigade,
bolos plata.

222
00:10:54,067 --> 00:10:57,600
(woman) get your hands
off of me! get off me!

223
00:10:57,634 --> 00:11:01,034
Help! get your hands
off of me!

224
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:03,333
Get off of me!

225
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,268
Get off of me!
let her go,
and back away!

226
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,433
Back away now!
get your hands off me!

227
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:10,234
(gasping)

228
00:11:10,268 --> 00:11:12,534
You're murderers!

229
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,934
All of you!

230
00:11:13,967 --> 00:11:16,634
Ma'am, take it easy.
i'm cbi.

231
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:18,634
Ma'am!

232
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:20,967
(engine revving)

233
00:11:21,001 --> 00:11:23,234
(engine starts)

234
00:11:23,268 --> 00:11:26,433
(tires peal)

235
00:11:28,767 --> 00:11:31,734
Who was that?
she a friend of yours?

236
00:11:31,767 --> 00:11:33,734
Never seen her before.

237
00:11:33,767 --> 00:11:36,734
Mentally deranged,
seems like. poor thing.

238
00:11:36,767 --> 00:11:39,767
You know, you're
a very good liar.

239
00:11:39,801 --> 00:11:41,767
Most people subconsciously
signal dishonesty,

240
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:44,268
But you? there's nothing.
no inner conflict.

241
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,767
Usually, that's the mark

242
00:11:45,801 --> 00:11:49,268
Of what shrinks
like to call a sociopath.

243
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,268
Well, if by "sociopath,"
you mean that if you cross me,

244
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:56,333
I would enjoy watching you
suffer pain before i kill you...

245
00:11:56,367 --> 00:11:59,268
Then, yeah,
i'm a sociopath.

246
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,300
See ya.

247
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:05,301
Bye.

248
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,734
(wayne) so we talked to
the gang unit.

249
00:12:16,801 --> 00:12:18,734
There's no other biker gang
would cross the saints

250
00:12:18,801 --> 00:12:20,734
And run the risk of starting
a war that they couldn't win.

251
00:12:20,801 --> 00:12:22,901
This is incredible.
you should see this.

252
00:12:22,967 --> 00:12:24,600
Hold on. anything on
the woman in the parking lot?

253
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:26,101
Sinner saints have
their own web site.

254
00:12:26,134 --> 00:12:27,834
Really?
yeah.

255
00:12:27,867 --> 00:12:29,834
We cross-checked registrations
of the truck model and color

256
00:12:29,867 --> 00:12:32,600
With driver's license photos
fitting her description.

257
00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:35,168
No hits. truck must be
registered to her husband

258
00:12:35,201 --> 00:12:38,134
Or other family member.
mcbride's clamming up about her
means he's hiding something.

259
00:12:38,168 --> 00:12:40,067
He's merged two other gangs
into the saints in the last

260
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:43,300
Five years. it's the fastest
growing gang in the nation.
go to hodge's office.

261
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:46,934
See if you can find anything on
the gang's operation that pops.

262
00:12:47,001 --> 00:12:48,467
And have the deerfield p.d.

263
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,967
Issue a bolo on
the woman's pickup truck.
okay.

264
00:12:51,001 --> 00:12:53,600
You can buy logo merchandise--
sinner saints coffee mugs,

265
00:12:53,667 --> 00:12:56,600
Decals, beach towels. whoa!
(telephone ringing)

266
00:12:56,667 --> 00:13:00,001
And some various other
interesting little knickknacks.
nice.

267
00:13:00,034 --> 00:13:03,001
Yeah. well, if they do it,
we should do it.

268
00:13:03,034 --> 00:13:04,967
A range of casual wear,
maybe?

269
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,268
Sensible shoes?

270
00:13:08,367 --> 00:13:10,300
I'll get right on that.

271
00:13:10,367 --> 00:13:12,634
Okay. lisbon loafers.

272
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,634
(computer beeps)
found something, boss.

273
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,801
These are gordon hodge's
cell phone calls

274
00:13:16,867 --> 00:13:18,801
From the night
of the murder.

275
00:13:18,867 --> 00:13:20,801
All were routine
business calls--

276
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:23,400
Von mcbride, other lawyers,
court officials.

277
00:13:23,433 --> 00:13:26,333
But it's the last call
that bumps.

278
00:13:26,367 --> 00:13:29,333
(computer beeps)
7:23, incoming from
a constance hoyt.

279
00:13:29,367 --> 00:13:32,134
"current address unknown."
must not want
people finding her.

280
00:13:32,201 --> 00:13:33,867
Well, i went back
three months--

281
00:13:33,901 --> 00:13:35,867
A lot of calls
between her and hodge.

282
00:13:35,901 --> 00:13:39,500
Did you try the number?
twice. got one of those
computer voice mail messages.

283
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:42,001
Plus, i ran her name
through the d.m.v.

284
00:13:42,067 --> 00:13:43,901
For registration
of a black pickup truck.

285
00:13:43,934 --> 00:13:46,901
She's not
your parking lot woman.
check von mcbride's
cell phone records.

286
00:13:46,934 --> 00:13:50,667
See if he had any contact
with this constance hoyt.
(typing on keyboard)

287
00:13:50,734 --> 00:13:52,667
(computer beeps)

288
00:13:52,734 --> 00:13:57,101
Bingo.
couple of chatty cathys.
talking three or four
times a day.

289
00:13:57,134 --> 00:14:00,534
Either she's his mom, or...
his girlfriend.

290
00:14:00,567 --> 00:14:03,034
(typing on keyboard)

291
00:14:03,067 --> 00:14:05,567
<i>(heavy metal music playing)</i>

292
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,634
(sets bottle down)
(sighs)

293
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,867
(birds chirping,
tires crunch, door opens)

294
00:14:17,934 --> 00:14:19,567
Constance?

295
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,101
(engine starts)
we just have a couple
questions for you.

296
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,767
I'll drive!
no time!

297
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:29,101
(door slams)

298
00:14:30,134 --> 00:14:33,268
Boss, seat belt.
go!

299
00:14:45,168 --> 00:14:47,300
(tires screech)

300
00:14:53,467 --> 00:14:55,634
(engines revving)

301
00:14:57,667 --> 00:15:00,333
Bike's got too much muscle.
you're gonna have to--

302
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:03,001
(tires squeal)

303
00:15:03,034 --> 00:15:04,001
(thudding)

304
00:15:04,034 --> 00:15:05,534
(tires rumbling)

305
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:27,834
(brakes squeal)

306
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:37,967
Do not even think
of moving.

307
00:15:38,001 --> 00:15:40,400
I gotta get you
out of the office more.

308
00:15:44,834 --> 00:15:46,834
(car door opens)

309
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:52,134
Got hodge's office key?
(keys jangle)

310
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,067
So what's your problem
with bikers?

311
00:15:54,101 --> 00:15:55,567
I hate bikers.

312
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,067
Why's that?

313
00:15:57,101 --> 00:15:59,067
My dad was a biker.

314
00:15:59,101 --> 00:16:00,634
Really?
i didn't know that.

315
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,634
(keys jangle)
no? i thought you
read my file.

316
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,867
Well, it says he was
a big-time criminal.

317
00:16:06,901 --> 00:16:09,567
Didn't specify
any affiliations.

318
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,567
Jimmy marks
on the doorknob.

319
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,667
Doubt that was part
of the original decor.

320
00:16:25,268 --> 00:16:27,034
Door clear.

321
00:16:27,067 --> 00:16:28,168
Clear.

322
00:16:28,234 --> 00:16:29,901
Desk clear.

323
00:16:33,901 --> 00:16:36,534
(sighs)

324
00:16:36,567 --> 00:16:40,168
Cracks are on the outside
of the window.

325
00:16:40,234 --> 00:16:42,201
Means a previous
break-in attempt.

326
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:44,201
Think they were
looking for something,

327
00:16:44,234 --> 00:16:46,367
Or just trying to
send a message? (sighs)

328
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,300
Message was definitely
a part of it.

329
00:16:53,801 --> 00:16:57,767
Do you prefer "constance,"
or "diamond"?

330
00:16:57,801 --> 00:17:01,268
(sighs) i prefer
to get the hell out of here.

331
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,567
You ran from the police,
endangered the lives

332
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,734
Of two agents. you could be
here a couple of days.
i don't think that's right.

333
00:17:07,767 --> 00:17:11,867
<i>why'd you run?
i ran because i'm dead if
anyone sees me talking to cops.</i>

334
00:17:11,934 --> 00:17:14,867
The saints are all paranoid
about informants now,

335
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:18,834
Which is why
i'm not saying a word.
tell us about your affair
with gordon hodge.

336
00:17:21,001 --> 00:17:24,500
(scoffs) i wasn't
sleeping with gordon.

337
00:17:26,101 --> 00:17:27,168
Oh.

338
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,300
Uh... yes, you were.

339
00:17:40,967 --> 00:17:43,834
It was only a few months.
we were just having fun.

340
00:17:43,867 --> 00:17:47,067
It's not like von doesn't
sleep around on me and...

341
00:17:47,134 --> 00:17:49,433
Gordon treated me nice.

342
00:17:49,467 --> 00:17:51,134
You had genuine feelings
for him.

343
00:17:51,168 --> 00:17:53,134
He was decent.

344
00:17:53,168 --> 00:17:55,901
He never looked down
on you.

345
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,767
Just got sucked in
too deep with the saints.

346
00:17:58,801 --> 00:18:01,234
Did you know he was
arrested for possession?

347
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,234
Told him a hundred times
to be careful,

348
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,034
But he got dumb
about it.

349
00:18:06,067 --> 00:18:08,534
Ah, well, drugs simply
make people careless.

350
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:11,367
You had to be a little concerned
about mcbride finding out.

351
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,467
It would've
made things complicated.

352
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,634
"complicated"
is one way to put it.

353
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:19,101
So you called him that night.
then what happened?

354
00:18:19,168 --> 00:18:21,101
Did you go and see him?

355
00:18:21,168 --> 00:18:22,767
No! no.

356
00:18:22,834 --> 00:18:26,667
I called to break it off.
i heard him answer the phone,

357
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,500
And i'd tried to talk to him,
but the line went dead.

358
00:18:29,534 --> 00:18:32,300
What about the woman
in the parking lot?
i don't know.

359
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:34,333
Von doesn't talk
gang business with me.

360
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:37,667
Had you seen her before?
she's come around
a few times

361
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,834
Last couple of weeks,
same thing--

362
00:18:39,867 --> 00:18:42,234
Lots of crazy yelling,
then taking off.

363
00:18:42,268 --> 00:18:43,734
Look...

364
00:18:43,767 --> 00:18:45,300
You, um...

365
00:18:45,367 --> 00:18:46,901
You gotta promise

366
00:18:46,934 --> 00:18:49,667
That von doesn't find out
about me and gordon.

367
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,667
He keeps
his cards close.

368
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,234
He could already know--

369
00:18:54,268 --> 00:18:56,201
Killed hodge
out of jealousy.

370
00:18:56,234 --> 00:18:58,667
(sighs) trust me.

371
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:03,867
If von knew, gordon's
wouldn't be the only dead body.

372
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:06,867
Only one other person knew.

373
00:19:06,901 --> 00:19:09,234
And that was bad enough.

374
00:19:09,268 --> 00:19:12,734
Who was that other person?
(sighs)

375
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,734
We have information
that suggests

376
00:19:14,767 --> 00:19:19,300
You knew about gordon
and another woman.

377
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,367
Yes, i did.

378
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,934
How?

379
00:19:25,967 --> 00:19:28,934
About four months ago,
i found a valet stub

380
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:31,934
On the driveway
from the deerfield inn.

381
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,934
So one night,
i followed him

382
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:37,834
And saw him go in
with that biker girl.

383
00:19:37,901 --> 00:19:39,901
Did you confront him?

384
00:19:39,934 --> 00:19:42,901
(slicing)
more like yell and hit him.

385
00:19:42,934 --> 00:19:45,934
He promised
he'd stop seeing her.

386
00:19:45,967 --> 00:19:47,867
I took him at his word,

387
00:19:47,934 --> 00:19:50,734
And i never asked him
about it again.
why not?

388
00:19:50,767 --> 00:19:54,433
Because i didn't want
to hear him lie to me.

389
00:19:54,467 --> 00:19:56,433
Mrs. hodge...
(whispers) what?

390
00:19:56,467 --> 00:19:58,934
If you picked up
on your husband's affair,

391
00:19:58,967 --> 00:20:01,734
You must've suspected about
his other illicit activities.

392
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:04,734
I knew about
the drugs and the partying.

393
00:20:04,767 --> 00:20:07,500
He was surrounded by it.

394
00:20:07,567 --> 00:20:09,567
Why didn't you tell us
about this earlier?

395
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,567
Because gordon is dead.

396
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,567
Anything that i said or did
would not bring him back.

397
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,901
My son draws
stares and whispers

398
00:20:17,934 --> 00:20:20,101
Because of his father,
agent lisbon.

399
00:20:20,134 --> 00:20:23,600
Both of us--
we deserve to grieve

400
00:20:23,634 --> 00:20:25,867
Without shame and scandal,
don't we?

401
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:28,867
Yes, you do.

402
00:20:28,934 --> 00:20:31,367
And if she'd followed
her husband once before,

403
00:20:31,433 --> 00:20:34,734
She could've tailed him again
and killed him.
no, she didn't do it.
she loved him.

404
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:36,567
She was a prisoner
of her husband's life.

405
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,034
She gets rid of him,
gets a fresh start.

406
00:20:39,101 --> 00:20:40,767
People trapped
in miserable lives

407
00:20:40,801 --> 00:20:43,467
Always talk about escaping.
few actually do it.

408
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,201
It's easier just
to close your eyes

409
00:20:45,268 --> 00:20:47,400
And pretend the misery
doesn't exist.

410
00:20:47,433 --> 00:20:49,600
Boss, you might want
to see this.

411
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,667
This is from a security camera
across the street.

412
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,667
It was the third incident
in two weeks.

413
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,300
Building owner said hodge didn't
want to report the earlier ones

414
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,467
Because he didn't want
deerfield p.d. combing through

415
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,901
His office and accidentally
finding something

416
00:21:03,967 --> 00:21:05,467
In his sinner saints file.
there.

417
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,767
Magnify.

418
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:11,234
(teresa) the woman
from the parking lot.

419
00:21:12,235 --> 00:21:14,235
***

420
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:25,268
(von) chaos brigade
controls distribution

421
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,467
Over in rancho rosa,
but i figure if we move

422
00:21:27,534 --> 00:21:29,467
Right now,
we can move into stratton.

423
00:21:29,534 --> 00:21:32,534
What's up, my brothers?

424
00:21:34,201 --> 00:21:37,367
We just have one quick
follow-up question for you.

425
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,867
(sighs)

426
00:21:38,901 --> 00:21:42,134
I've exceeded my quota of
answering cops' questions.

427
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:45,268
And my quota of crazy.
(laughs)

428
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,834
The woman
in the parking lot.

429
00:21:48,901 --> 00:21:51,934
Uh, like i said,
she must've mistaken me--

430
00:21:51,967 --> 00:21:54,067
She was seen
vandalizing hodge's office.

431
00:21:57,734 --> 00:22:00,234
She find anything
she shouldn't have?

432
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,834
His files were intact.
she got nothing.

433
00:22:02,901 --> 00:22:04,934
We have nothing further
to talk about, then.

434
00:22:05,001 --> 00:22:07,934
The sooner this case is closed,
the sooner we're gone

435
00:22:08,001 --> 00:22:11,367
And you're back
to business as usual.

436
00:22:16,934 --> 00:22:19,268
Last name is guthrie.

437
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:23,201
She's the sister of a gentleman
i was accused of killing.

438
00:22:23,268 --> 00:22:24,801
Falsely, of course.

439
00:22:24,834 --> 00:22:27,867
Trial was
a couple of weeks ago,

440
00:22:27,934 --> 00:22:31,134
Gordon hit a home run.
got me off.

441
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:33,134
And you weren't eager
to i.d. her

442
00:22:33,168 --> 00:22:35,634
Because you didn't want us
poking around your case?

443
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:38,634
Hey, all i know is
that she's been coming around

444
00:22:38,667 --> 00:22:42,433
From time to time, saying some
very offensive things.

445
00:22:42,467 --> 00:22:44,767
Thanks for your cooperation.

446
00:22:44,801 --> 00:22:47,600
You think she killed gordon?

447
00:22:47,634 --> 00:22:52,567
Like i said,
thanks for your cooperation.

448
00:22:52,634 --> 00:22:55,734
I've got one last question.

449
00:22:55,801 --> 00:22:58,433
If hodge wasn't
the informant in your gang,

450
00:22:58,467 --> 00:23:00,101
Who do you think it is?

451
00:23:00,134 --> 00:23:02,101
I mean,
i tried asking the d.a.,

452
00:23:02,134 --> 00:23:04,667
But he's kind of
a secretive bastard, huh?

453
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,500
What do you think?

454
00:23:07,534 --> 00:23:10,234
Mr. jane,
we're a motorcycle club,

455
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,734
Not a gang.

456
00:23:12,801 --> 00:23:15,734
And i can assure you
there is no informant.

457
00:23:15,801 --> 00:23:18,300
Well, you'd know best.

458
00:23:24,667 --> 00:23:27,367
Why does he keep going on
about this informant?

459
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,433
He's just talking.

460
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,834
Let's get down
to business.

461
00:23:37,001 --> 00:23:40,467
Von mcbride should be
sitting here, not me.

462
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,134
Court docs say your brother rick
was an auto mechanic.

463
00:23:43,168 --> 00:23:45,634
Mcbride blamed him
for screwing up a repair,

464
00:23:45,667 --> 00:23:47,634
And your brother
refused to redo it.

465
00:23:47,667 --> 00:23:50,067
Mcbride allegedly
got angry and killed him.

466
00:23:50,134 --> 00:23:52,934
Not "allegedly."
he killed him.

467
00:23:53,001 --> 00:23:55,467
He beat him to death
with a crowbar.

468
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:58,700
He murdered him.
and the jury disagreed.

469
00:23:58,734 --> 00:24:01,201
Mcbride acted
in self-defense, right?

470
00:24:01,234 --> 00:24:03,201
That's because
that lawyer hodge

471
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:05,567
Made it look like
it was my brother's fault.

472
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,168
He started throwing around
all these lies about my brother,

473
00:24:08,201 --> 00:24:10,034
Saying that my brother
was a druggie,

474
00:24:10,067 --> 00:24:13,234
That he was aggressive,
that he was mentally unstable.

475
00:24:13,268 --> 00:24:15,867
So you get all worked up,
harass the gang,

476
00:24:15,901 --> 00:24:17,867
Trash hodge's office,
right?
(scoffs)

477
00:24:17,901 --> 00:24:20,867
You want to arrest me
for that, go ahead.

478
00:24:20,901 --> 00:24:24,234
I'm not gonna fight you.
i'm too tired.
you ever try hodge's home?

479
00:24:24,268 --> 00:24:26,067
Once.

480
00:24:26,101 --> 00:24:28,067
But his kid came outside.

481
00:24:28,101 --> 00:24:30,600
I don't have
a beef with him,

482
00:24:30,634 --> 00:24:33,234
So i took off
before i could do anything.

483
00:24:33,268 --> 00:24:36,234
And what were you gonna do?
i don't know.

484
00:24:36,268 --> 00:24:40,001
I was...

485
00:24:40,067 --> 00:24:43,567
I don't know.

486
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,567
I wanted hodge
to understand

487
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,700
What he had done to me
and to my family.
when was this?

488
00:24:48,734 --> 00:24:52,367
Two days ago.

489
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,600
The day of the murder.
where were you that night?
home.

490
00:24:55,634 --> 00:24:58,734
Can anyone verify it?
i live alone,
but i didn't--

491
00:24:58,767 --> 00:25:00,400
Now six months ago,

492
00:25:00,433 --> 00:25:02,934
You were arrested
in a road rage incident.

493
00:25:02,967 --> 00:25:04,834
Got out of your car
at a red light,

494
00:25:04,901 --> 00:25:06,767
Attacked a man
in an s.u.v.

495
00:25:06,801 --> 00:25:08,934
What does this
have to do with anything?

496
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:11,834
You're an angry person
and you express it physically.

497
00:25:11,901 --> 00:25:14,333
(sighs) i'm not angry,
i am sad.

498
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,901
My brother
was a good man.

499
00:25:19,834 --> 00:25:21,801
The only crime he committed

500
00:25:21,834 --> 00:25:24,367
Was standing up
to that bastard mcbride.

501
00:25:24,433 --> 00:25:26,734
Hodge blackens the name
of your dead brother

502
00:25:26,767 --> 00:25:29,734
And gets von mcbride off.
now maybe trashing his office

503
00:25:29,767 --> 00:25:31,734
Didn't give you
enough satisfaction--

504
00:25:31,767 --> 00:25:34,600
Perfectly understandable
if your frustration boils over.

505
00:25:34,634 --> 00:25:37,634
And you can't touch von mcbride.
he's got 20 bikers around him

506
00:25:37,667 --> 00:25:40,634
All the time, so maybe
you go for the easier target.

507
00:25:40,667 --> 00:25:42,634
I didn't kill
gordon hodge,

508
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:45,967
But i'm sure as hell
glad that he's dead.

509
00:25:48,801 --> 00:25:51,101
She'd been to his house
that day.

510
00:25:51,134 --> 00:25:53,634
Could've laid in wait
and followed him later.

511
00:25:53,667 --> 00:25:56,567
Plus, she was out for revenge--
no more powerful motive.
we don't have
nearly enough to charge her.

512
00:25:56,634 --> 00:25:58,634
I say we hold her
on the vandalism.

513
00:25:58,667 --> 00:26:01,634
Try to dig up something that
puts her at the murder scene.

514
00:26:01,667 --> 00:26:04,300
Or you could release her.
she's obviously impulsive

515
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:07,134
And sloppy enough
to get caught on camera.

516
00:26:07,168 --> 00:26:09,667
She'll think
she's bought herself some time.

517
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,834
And she'd try something
to cover her tracks

518
00:26:11,867 --> 00:26:14,067
And implicate herself.

519
00:26:14,134 --> 00:26:17,367
Cut her loose,
then let's shadow her.

520
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,400
Yes, boss.

521
00:26:19,467 --> 00:26:21,400
(groans)

522
00:26:21,467 --> 00:26:23,400
Where are you going?

523
00:26:23,467 --> 00:26:24,901
Fresh air.

524
00:26:24,967 --> 00:26:27,400
All this murder talk...
"is rank.

525
00:26:27,467 --> 00:26:29,901
"it stinks to heaven.

526
00:26:29,967 --> 00:26:33,901
(british accent) it hath
the primal eldest curse upon't."

527
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,967
Shakespeare.

528
00:26:47,901 --> 00:26:50,901
(brakes squeal)

529
00:26:53,901 --> 00:26:56,901
(brakes squeal)

530
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:01,834
Little less pressure
on the brake pedal. (chuckles)

531
00:27:01,867 --> 00:27:03,834
Is your mom here?

532
00:27:03,867 --> 00:27:06,967
Market. that's why
i'm confined to the driveway.

533
00:27:07,034 --> 00:27:09,367
Ah.
you want me to
have her call you?

534
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,168
We know felicia guthrie
trespassed on the property

535
00:27:12,201 --> 00:27:14,834
The day your dad
was killed.

536
00:27:14,867 --> 00:27:17,333
I-i just need to hear
what happened.

537
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,333
Uh, i was
leaving for school.

538
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,567
I saw her hop the gate and come
running up the driveway,

539
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,034
So i ran out
to try to stop her.

540
00:27:25,067 --> 00:27:27,534
She was yelling
all this stuff about my dad

541
00:27:27,567 --> 00:27:29,734
Lying about her brother
and getting von mcbride off.

542
00:27:29,767 --> 00:27:33,067
Then she just ran away.
did your parents see her?

543
00:27:33,101 --> 00:27:36,101
No. dad was already at work,
and mom was in the shower.

544
00:27:36,134 --> 00:27:38,734
Huh. any reason you didn't
bring this up earlier?

545
00:27:38,767 --> 00:27:40,234
I don't know.

546
00:27:40,268 --> 00:27:43,001
I felt bad for her,
i guess.

547
00:27:43,067 --> 00:27:45,001
Didn't want her
to get in trouble.

548
00:27:45,067 --> 00:27:47,400
Well, just needed
to confirm. thanks.

549
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:49,234
(engine grinds)

550
00:27:49,268 --> 00:27:51,734
Whoa!
(sighs) aw, god!

551
00:27:51,767 --> 00:27:53,801
You need to relax.

552
00:27:53,834 --> 00:27:56,600
It's not gonna help. i'm never
gonna get the hang of this.

553
00:27:56,634 --> 00:27:58,967
That's an easy fix.
you need the right instructor.

554
00:27:59,001 --> 00:28:02,734
All right. so now you can
speed up a little.

555
00:28:02,767 --> 00:28:06,067
Excellent. i like how
you're keeping your distance.

556
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:08,367
Just trust your instincts.
they're always right.

557
00:28:08,433 --> 00:28:10,700
You're a good instructor.

558
00:28:10,767 --> 00:28:13,201
Yeah, i am,
probably because i have

559
00:28:13,268 --> 00:28:15,700
Zero emotional investment
in how you do--

560
00:28:15,767 --> 00:28:17,934
Unlike your father,

561
00:28:17,967 --> 00:28:20,967
Who i'm guessing got annoyed
with every mistake you made.

562
00:28:21,001 --> 00:28:23,168
He wasn't
the most patient guy.

563
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:26,101
Probably didn't help that
he was always on his cell phone.

564
00:28:26,134 --> 00:28:28,767
Been living with his job
my whole life.

565
00:28:28,801 --> 00:28:31,001
You get used to it.

566
00:28:31,034 --> 00:28:33,500
You also
get used to the drugs

567
00:28:33,534 --> 00:28:36,067
And the cheating
on your mother?

568
00:28:36,134 --> 00:28:38,067
He promised he'd stop.

569
00:28:38,134 --> 00:28:39,834
Yeah.

570
00:28:39,867 --> 00:28:42,333
Can't be easy
going through life

571
00:28:42,367 --> 00:28:44,433
Being labeled
the gang lawyer's son.

572
00:28:44,467 --> 00:28:46,433
It wasn't
really that bad.

573
00:28:46,467 --> 00:28:49,268
I mean, girls would
come up to me all the time,

574
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:52,201
Talk to me about dad
and the gang, like i'm cool...

575
00:28:52,268 --> 00:28:55,600
(chuckles) instead of a geek,
which i basically am.
everybody is.

576
00:28:57,534 --> 00:29:00,934
I am.

577
00:29:01,001 --> 00:29:04,201
If he was my father,
i tell ya, i-i...

578
00:29:04,234 --> 00:29:06,834
I'd be mad at him.

579
00:29:06,867 --> 00:29:08,934
Dad didn't mean
to hurt anyone.

580
00:29:09,001 --> 00:29:10,834
He was just
doing his job.

581
00:29:10,867 --> 00:29:12,333
Right.

582
00:29:12,367 --> 00:29:15,333
Well, i guess i'd still love him
if he was my father.

583
00:29:15,367 --> 00:29:17,700
Can't say i'd cut him
the same kind of slack

584
00:29:17,734 --> 00:29:19,700
If i was
married to him.

585
00:29:19,734 --> 00:29:22,300
Are you trying to
blame my mom?

586
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:24,333
'cause if you are...
what?

587
00:29:24,367 --> 00:29:26,333
You're wrong, that's all.

588
00:29:26,367 --> 00:29:28,700
She loved him, too.

589
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:31,333
Well, that brings us
back to felicia guthrie,

590
00:29:31,367 --> 00:29:33,333
Who didn't love him at all.

591
00:29:33,367 --> 00:29:36,001
What exactly did she say
to you when you saw her?

592
00:29:36,034 --> 00:29:38,001
It was hard to tell.

593
00:29:38,034 --> 00:29:40,367
She was just, you know,
ranting, basically.

594
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,400
Didn't make much sense.

595
00:29:54,067 --> 00:29:56,534
Very nicely done.

596
00:29:56,567 --> 00:29:59,534
You'll be out cruising
on saturday nights in no time.

597
00:29:59,567 --> 00:30:02,433
Just remember,
trust your instincts.

598
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,433
They're always right.
thank you.

599
00:30:04,467 --> 00:30:07,034
And thanks for
the driving lesson.
(whispers) yeah.

600
00:30:11,467 --> 00:30:13,433
(dog barking in distance)

601
00:30:13,467 --> 00:30:15,433
Still no movement.

602
00:30:15,467 --> 00:30:17,967
Looks like
she's in for the night.

603
00:30:20,067 --> 00:30:21,467
Talk to van pelt recently?

604
00:30:21,567 --> 00:30:24,467
Yep.

605
00:30:24,534 --> 00:30:26,467
Any progress?
nope.

606
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,600
(engines rumbling in distance)
you hear that?

607
00:30:31,634 --> 00:30:33,634
Yeah.

608
00:30:45,634 --> 00:30:48,433
They're gonna
go after felicia.

609
00:30:48,467 --> 00:30:50,367
Mcbride thinks
she killed hodge,

610
00:30:50,433 --> 00:30:51,867
Wants payback.

611
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:53,867
Officers on hampton,
north of lexington,

612
00:30:53,934 --> 00:30:55,433
Request
immediate assistance.

613
00:31:03,001 --> 00:31:04,801
What the hell's
going on?

614
00:31:04,834 --> 00:31:09,467
Go back in your house
and stay down!

615
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:30,300
Do the smart thing
and get out of here right now!

616
00:31:30,333 --> 00:31:33,001
We're not doing
anything illegal.

617
00:31:33,034 --> 00:31:36,067
(loudly)
disorderly conduct,

618
00:31:36,134 --> 00:31:38,734
Concealed weapons,
blown exhaust pipes,

619
00:31:38,801 --> 00:31:41,333
Probably a couple of
outstanding warrants in there!

620
00:31:41,367 --> 00:31:43,400
(man) screw you, pig!

621
00:31:45,367 --> 00:31:48,500
We could bust
half you clowns right now!

622
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:54,500
So what's it gonna be?

623
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:04,801
We'll be seeing you around.

624
00:32:09,834 --> 00:32:12,667
(engines revving)

625
00:32:27,468 --> 00:32:28,468
***

626
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,467
(felicia) if they think they can
intimidate me, they're wrong.

627
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,801
Felicia, temperatures
are running hot,

628
00:32:42,834 --> 00:32:45,967
So i need you to stay away from
the gang's bar from now on.

629
00:32:46,001 --> 00:32:49,034
(felicia) yeah. i'll stay away
when you arrest von mcbride.

630
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:50,867
And what were you people
doing out here, anyway?

631
00:32:50,901 --> 00:32:52,867
Oh, we think you killed,
uh, gordon hodge,

632
00:32:52,901 --> 00:32:56,901
So agent cho and rigsby
are watching you.

633
00:32:56,934 --> 00:32:59,400
Oh, come on.
she was never gonna buy,

634
00:32:59,433 --> 00:33:01,801
"we just happened to be
in the neighborhood."

635
00:33:01,867 --> 00:33:04,834
I told you i had
nothing to do with that.

636
00:33:04,867 --> 00:33:07,400
And who told you
that you could go in my house?

637
00:33:07,433 --> 00:33:09,967
Oh, this? i just needed
some tea. cut through the chill.

638
00:33:10,034 --> 00:33:12,667
Chill, my ass.
you were looking for evidence.

639
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,667
Felicia, take it easy.
don't tell me to
take it easy, when this guy's

640
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,867
Rifling through my underwear
drawer, looking for a weapon.

641
00:33:18,901 --> 00:33:21,001
It was your closet, actually.
i was looking for

642
00:33:21,034 --> 00:33:23,567
Blood-splattered shoes.
get off my property.

643
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,767
<i>you're very touchy.
go.</i>

644
00:33:25,801 --> 00:33:28,801
(indistinct chatter
over police radio)

645
00:33:30,567 --> 00:33:32,534
You really looked
through her closet?
laundry,too.

646
00:33:32,567 --> 00:33:35,034
She's been angry and emotional
about her brother,

647
00:33:35,067 --> 00:33:38,700
Which means that she was sloppy
about hodge's murder--

648
00:33:38,734 --> 00:33:40,067
Dragged evidence
home with her.

649
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:42,333
It's just not inside.

650
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,333
Well, there's no garage
or toolshed.

651
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,034
Well, i looked
everywhere.

652
00:33:46,067 --> 00:33:48,467
Well, everywhere
except the garbage.

653
00:33:48,534 --> 00:33:49,967
Why not?

654
00:33:50,034 --> 00:33:51,534
Well,
it's garbage.

655
00:33:51,567 --> 00:33:53,934
(sighs)
you done with that?

656
00:33:53,967 --> 00:33:55,600
Almost.

657
00:33:55,634 --> 00:33:57,667
(tea splashes)

658
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,901
Yes,
the case is still ongoing,

659
00:34:02,934 --> 00:34:04,967
And you are
a person of interest.

660
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:07,967
I'd advise you
not to leave town.

661
00:34:08,001 --> 00:34:09,634
Boss?

662
00:34:09,667 --> 00:34:11,268
Excuse me.

663
00:34:12,767 --> 00:34:15,134
Do you see that?

664
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:17,567
What's goin' on?

665
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,433
Stay there. don't move.

666
00:34:29,268 --> 00:34:32,234
(felicia)
i didn't do anything wrong.

667
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,234
Mcbride must've set me up.

668
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,234
Rigsby, put her
in interview one.

669
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,433
Boss, nina and lucas hodge
are here to see you.

670
00:34:38,467 --> 00:34:41,268
She say why?
because i asked
them down here.

671
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,767
Rigsby, could you bring her
through here, please?

672
00:34:43,801 --> 00:34:46,700
It'll just take a minute.
thank you.
are you gonna tell me
what this is about?

673
00:34:46,767 --> 00:34:49,934
I'm just closing
your case.

674
00:34:51,934 --> 00:34:54,268
(patrick) thanks for
coming down, mrs. hodge.

675
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,934
This woman's name is
felicia guthrie.

676
00:34:56,967 --> 00:34:59,901
She murdered your husband
out of revenge for getting

677
00:34:59,967 --> 00:35:02,268
Von mcbride off a charge
for killing her brother.
oh, my god!

678
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,201
No, i did not kill anyone.

679
00:35:04,234 --> 00:35:06,367
Uh, we have evidence.

680
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,801
We just need
your permission for, uh,

681
00:35:08,834 --> 00:35:10,834
Lucas to make a formal
statement, saying that

682
00:35:10,867 --> 00:35:12,934
He saw her at your house
the day of the murder.

683
00:35:13,001 --> 00:35:15,867
You saw her?
well, he can
fill you in later.

684
00:35:15,901 --> 00:35:18,168
His statement will give us
a better chance at a conviction.

685
00:35:18,201 --> 00:35:21,001
Absolutely.
anything you need.
great. thank you.

686
00:35:21,034 --> 00:35:24,500
Lucas, if you can confirm
that this is who you saw,

687
00:35:24,534 --> 00:35:27,034
Then you'll be on your way.

688
00:35:27,067 --> 00:35:28,834
What's gonna
happen to her?

689
00:35:28,867 --> 00:35:31,333
Well,
probably life in prison.

690
00:35:31,367 --> 00:35:36,268
Uh, if she's lucky, she might
get paroled in 25 years.

691
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:38,367
I swear, i didn't--
i didn't touch him!

692
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,367
Shut up! you took
everything from us.

693
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:45,867
Lucas, we need to book her now,
so could you identify her?
no, she wasn't the one.

694
00:35:45,901 --> 00:35:49,034
I mean, yeah,
she came to the house--
great. thanks.
that's all we need.

695
00:35:49,067 --> 00:35:51,067
Take her away, guys.
thank you. thank you.
(felicia)
no, i didn't do anything!

696
00:35:51,101 --> 00:35:54,867
I didn't do anything wrong!
trust your instincts, lucas.
they're always right.

697
00:35:54,901 --> 00:35:58,201
(breathing heavily)
let's go.

698
00:35:58,234 --> 00:36:00,734
(sighing)
she couldn't have done it.
what makes you say that?

699
00:36:00,767 --> 00:36:03,400
I just know.
lucas,
they have evidence.

700
00:36:03,433 --> 00:36:07,300
This bitch killed
your father!
don't call her that!
it wasn't her.

701
00:36:07,367 --> 00:36:09,201
The only way we can know
for certain is if you tell us

702
00:36:09,234 --> 00:36:12,067
Who did it.
okay, stop talking to my son.
you've got your statement.

703
00:36:12,101 --> 00:36:15,034
Lucas, let's go.
come on! let's go!
no!

704
00:36:15,067 --> 00:36:16,534
Lucas!
stop!

705
00:36:25,268 --> 00:36:28,034
(sighs) it was me.

706
00:36:28,067 --> 00:36:31,034
(sighs) we were out
for a driving lesson.

707
00:36:31,067 --> 00:36:33,534
I was driving badly that night,

708
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:36,534
And my dad was
on the phone the whole time,

709
00:36:36,567 --> 00:36:39,500
Like he always was.

710
00:36:39,567 --> 00:36:42,001
<i>(cell phone rings)
he'd get mad every time
i'd make a mistake,</i>

711
00:36:42,067 --> 00:36:44,400
<i>but i just couldn't
seem to concentrate.</i>

712
00:36:44,433 --> 00:36:47,300
Because of your run-in
with felicia guthrie that day.

713
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:50,234
You didn't talk about her
until i asked,

714
00:36:50,268 --> 00:36:52,801
'cause you
felt sorry for her.

715
00:36:52,834 --> 00:36:54,934
You didn't want to
draw suspicion to her,

716
00:36:54,967 --> 00:36:57,934
Because you knew
she didn't do it.

717
00:36:57,967 --> 00:37:00,201
You were trying to do
the right thing.

718
00:37:00,268 --> 00:37:02,767
I just kept seeing her
in the driveway,

719
00:37:02,801 --> 00:37:08,067
Crying, yelling about how my dad
lied about her brother.

720
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:11,034
<i>his phone
just kept ringing...
(cell phone rings)</i>

721
00:37:11,101 --> 00:37:13,967
<i>and he'd get mad at me
and i'd screw up worse,</i>

722
00:37:14,001 --> 00:37:16,634
<i>and i just...
i couldn't take it anymore.</i>

723
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:19,433
<i>next time his phone rang...
(cell phone rings)</i>

724
00:37:19,467 --> 00:37:22,667
<i>i grabbed it from him.
i heard her voice.</i>

725
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:26,168
<i>(constance) hey, gordon baby,
it's me. can you talk?</i>

726
00:37:26,201 --> 00:37:29,467
That biker bitch--
diamond.

727
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,934
She kept calling him
"gordon baby."

728
00:37:31,967 --> 00:37:33,934
Said she really
wanted to see him.

729
00:37:33,967 --> 00:37:36,634
Felicia guthrie was right.
he was a liar.

730
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:42,967
<i>i threw the phone
into the woods, and he got mad.</i>

731
00:37:43,001 --> 00:37:45,901
<i>he promised me he'd stop</i>

732
00:37:45,967 --> 00:37:49,101
<i>doing drugs
and cheating on my mom.</i>

733
00:37:49,134 --> 00:37:53,168
<i>and like an idiot,
i believed him.</i>

734
00:38:02,567 --> 00:38:04,367
I called my mom.

735
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,333
<i>she told me what to do.</i>

736
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:10,333
I grabbed all the stuff
to make it look like a robbery,

737
00:38:10,367 --> 00:38:13,534
But i couldn't get
that damn cuff link out.

738
00:38:13,567 --> 00:38:15,367
So i ditched his car
in the lake.

739
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,367
She drove me home.

740
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:21,268
The lie gets heavy fast,
doesn't it?

741
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:23,268
I expect after a while,

742
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:26,500
You wanted to go to the police
and tell them the truth.

743
00:38:26,534 --> 00:38:28,168
<i>sometimes i wanted to.</i>

744
00:38:28,201 --> 00:38:31,034
<i>mom said no.</i>

745
00:38:31,067 --> 00:38:34,034
She promised
it would be okay.

746
00:38:34,067 --> 00:38:36,034
Well, it might be...

747
00:38:36,067 --> 00:38:37,867
Someday.

748
00:38:42,534 --> 00:38:46,034
Let's go.
(handcuffs jangle)

749
00:38:46,067 --> 00:38:49,067
<i>yeah, there we go.
(sighs)
(handcuffs clicking)</i>

750
00:38:52,367 --> 00:38:54,333
<i>(voice breaking)
i'm sorry, mom.</i>

751
00:39:03,734 --> 00:39:07,001
You know, i have to wonder
how that cuff link rigsby found

752
00:39:07,067 --> 00:39:09,500
Made its way
to felicia guthrie's house.

753
00:39:09,567 --> 00:39:11,500
That is a conundrum.

754
00:39:11,567 --> 00:39:13,500
Because i'll bet
a year's salary

755
00:39:13,567 --> 00:39:15,700
That if i look
in the evidence locker,

756
00:39:15,734 --> 00:39:18,700
The cuff link we found on hodge
will have mysteriously vanished.

757
00:39:18,734 --> 00:39:20,700
Okay.

758
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:23,700
I needed lucas to see
felicia get arrested.

759
00:39:23,734 --> 00:39:25,168
You needed hard evidence
to charge felicia.

760
00:39:25,234 --> 00:39:27,901
So...

761
00:39:27,934 --> 00:39:30,268
I made it happen.

762
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,268
By making
an innocent woman think

763
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,300
She was gonna go
to prison?

764
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:36,300
As if her life wasn't
hard enough already.

765
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:38,268
<i>yes, you're right.
she does deserve some justice.</i>

766
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,967
It's good to see
you care.

767
00:39:41,001 --> 00:39:44,268
You know, sarcasm
is the lowest form of wit.

768
00:39:48,967 --> 00:39:51,433
<i>(heavy metal music playing)</i>

769
00:39:51,467 --> 00:39:54,467
(speaking indistinctly)

770
00:39:56,101 --> 00:39:58,268
(cell phone ringing)

771
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:05,801
Yeah?

772
00:40:09,168 --> 00:40:10,567
All right.

773
00:40:10,634 --> 00:40:13,134
I'll be back
in a minute.

774
00:40:21,134 --> 00:40:24,300
(man whispers)
hey, psst.

775
00:40:24,333 --> 00:40:27,101
Over here.

776
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:38,667
What's up?

777
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,667
Uh, well, i thought
you might want to know

778
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,667
We caught
gordon hodge's killer.

779
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,801
It was his son.

780
00:40:45,834 --> 00:40:48,034
Lot of issues
between 'em.

781
00:40:48,067 --> 00:40:51,867
And you felt the need to
tell me this from the shadows,

782
00:40:51,901 --> 00:40:53,867
Dressed in this getup?

783
00:40:53,901 --> 00:40:55,367
Self-preservation.

784
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,367
I figured i'd worn out
my welcome with your friends.

785
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,867
That's it?

786
00:40:59,901 --> 00:41:02,467
This is what
you had to tell me?

787
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,867
Well, no.
there's another reason.

788
00:41:07,067 --> 00:41:10,901
You open that envelope,

789
00:41:10,934 --> 00:41:13,400
And the rat in your gang
will be revealed.

790
00:41:13,433 --> 00:41:15,767
<i>oh, the rat.</i>

791
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:21,201
Now turn around and try
not to look too guilty.

792
00:41:25,901 --> 00:41:28,134
What was that about?

793
00:41:28,201 --> 00:41:31,034
What, this?
this is, uh... (chuckles)

794
00:41:31,067 --> 00:41:33,767
It's kind of funny,
actually.
yeah, funny?

795
00:41:37,367 --> 00:41:39,300
Selling us out is funny?!

796
00:41:39,367 --> 00:41:40,567
Hey, man.
you got it wrong, bro!

797
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,567
Come on! get over here!
hey! hey!

798
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,634
(scuffling)

799
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,567
