1
00:00:13,498 --> 00:00:14,548
Nice place.

2
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:17,227
Where does a baseball scout
get this kind of money?

3
00:00:17,352 --> 00:00:18,360
Barney sloop?

4
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:21,685
He's got 15 players in the Majors
and a piece of everything they make.

5
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,663
A million-dollar eye for talent.
He spots'em young all over the world,

6
00:00:24,788 --> 00:00:26,233
brings'em here, trains'em,

7
00:00:26,358 --> 00:00:28,158
Gets'em fat pro contracts.

8
00:00:29,472 --> 00:00:30,672
So you played.

9
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:32,610
I played a little.

10
00:00:34,037 --> 00:00:36,187
Pitcher?
Controlling the action?

11
00:00:36,858 --> 00:00:39,058
- Man with the ball.
- I stopped.

12
00:00:40,429 --> 00:00:43,209
Which you still have
unresolved bad feelings about.

13
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,590
Now I see it.
That's why you joined the gang.

14
00:00:50,442 --> 00:00:52,149
Your parents disagreed
about baseball,

15
00:00:52,274 --> 00:00:55,123
so they made you quit it,
crushed your dream.

16
00:00:55,248 --> 00:00:58,206
You were angry about it,
but you couldn't express that directly,

17
00:00:58,331 --> 00:01:01,102
so you joined a gang
as an outlet for all that anger.

18
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,620
Actually, I tore my A.C.L.
Nice try.

19
00:01:07,945 --> 00:01:08,854
Parents.

20
00:01:09,706 --> 00:01:11,069
It's funny, isn't it.

21
00:01:11,787 --> 00:01:14,365
Big regrets in life
people keep to themselves?

22
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:16,622
I don't know.
I tell people about you.

23
00:01:16,747 --> 00:01:18,296
Nice one. A zinger.

24
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:19,828
High and tight.

25
00:01:21,121 --> 00:01:24,541
As close as we can tell,
the murder occurred around 10:30 p.m.

26
00:01:25,216 --> 00:01:26,135
Thanks.

27
00:01:28,112 --> 00:01:30,162
No big mysteries, weapon-wise.

28
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:33,091
- Looks like three or four blows.
- Rage killing.

29
00:01:33,216 --> 00:01:35,594
The coroner estimates
T.O.D. around 10:30 last night.

30
00:01:36,587 --> 00:01:38,351
They're here, finally.

31
00:01:40,023 --> 00:01:43,269
Freddy Fitch, Barney's partner.
I want to know who did this, quickly.

32
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,272
Agent Lisbon.
This is agent Cho. Jane.

33
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,309
Anything you need, it's yours.

34
00:01:49,572 --> 00:01:50,693
I can't believe it.

35
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:53,821
- This was his garden?
- His peace garden, he called it.

36
00:01:54,754 --> 00:01:57,408
A year or so ago he got into
all this zen malarkey.

37
00:01:58,009 --> 00:01:59,660
Who had access to this area?

38
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:02,580
Everyone at the academy,
Six players in residence,

39
00:02:02,828 --> 00:02:04,730
family members, staff.

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,057
We'll need a list.

41
00:02:06,182 --> 00:02:09,503
Sure. But trust me,
no one here w-would hurt Barney.

42
00:02:09,843 --> 00:02:12,631
- You discovered the body?
- I was out of town yesterday.

43
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,397
A high school clinic in Portland.
Flew back early this morning,

44
00:02:15,522 --> 00:02:18,596
came straight here,
found him like this. My god.

45
00:02:19,015 --> 00:02:20,665
<i>Run, run, run! Come on!</i>

46
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,184
<i>Work it, Scotty, work it!</i>

47
00:02:23,451 --> 00:02:26,052
His body's still warm
and they'retraining?

48
00:02:26,591 --> 00:02:29,641
I said they could skip the workout.
They wouldn't.

49
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,943
"Hold on to the dream."
That's what he told them.

50
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,405
Barney was like a father
to these kids.

51
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:37,873
Pitching islegs!

52
00:02:37,998 --> 00:02:40,201
Look, dad, I'm ahead of you!

53
00:02:40,532 --> 00:02:42,732
Seems they have their own fathers.

54
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:44,513
These kids are minors.

55
00:02:44,945 --> 00:02:48,395
We bring the dads out
to sign off on deals, moral support.

56
00:02:51,036 --> 00:02:53,336
Scotty Sinclair and Snake Gallidos.

57
00:02:54,395 --> 00:02:56,645
Five drooling scouts coming today.

58
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:58,761
Maybe now isn't the best time.

59
00:02:59,227 --> 00:03:00,677
Barney set this up.

60
00:03:01,127 --> 00:03:02,434
His last showcase.

61
00:03:03,187 --> 00:03:04,391
I'm gonna honor that.

62
00:03:04,645 --> 00:03:06,214
It's what Barney would one.

63
00:03:07,523 --> 00:03:10,689
I know you gotta talk to them.
It's your job, but please.

64
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:14,026
We can let the kids finish.
Let's take a look at his house.

65
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,394
- How do you know where it's at?
- Because this thing

66
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,419
is a map of his whole life.

67
00:03:20,008 --> 00:03:20,917
Work,

68
00:03:21,529 --> 00:03:22,962
garden, home.

69
00:03:23,982 --> 00:03:25,037
Zen malarkey.

70
00:03:28,515 --> 00:03:32,242
I don't expect it's much to look at
a simple bed or a thing or...

71
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,092
2x10
"Throwing Fire"

72
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:48,060
Hey. You all right?

73
00:03:48,899 --> 00:03:49,808
I see it.

74
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,184
A cigarette case.

75
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:54,765
A cigarette case.

76
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,920
Very good.

77
00:03:58,472 --> 00:03:59,238
But...

78
00:04:00,382 --> 00:04:02,195
What's it made out of, son?

79
00:04:02,852 --> 00:04:05,045
What kind of cigarette case,

80
00:04:05,802 --> 00:04:06,711
Patrick?

81
00:04:08,385 --> 00:04:09,748
What would you say?

82
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,012
What's it made of?

83
00:04:13,661 --> 00:04:14,961
Sterling silver.

84
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:21,719
Your sterling silver
cigarette case back.

85
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:26,390
- Next object would be
- The cigarette case...

86
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:31,020
It once belonged to someone very,

87
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:32,588
very close to you.

88
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:35,057
That's right.

89
00:04:36,572 --> 00:04:38,411
The boy wonder sees all.

90
00:04:39,072 --> 00:04:40,822
The next object, Patrick.

91
00:04:41,523 --> 00:04:43,032
Someone who's passed on...

92
00:04:44,962 --> 00:04:46,150
Quite recently.

93
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,093
Last month.

94
00:04:49,548 --> 00:04:50,898
Your grandfather.

95
00:04:53,674 --> 00:04:54,919
Your grandmother.

96
00:04:57,982 --> 00:04:59,220
She loved you...

97
00:05:00,325 --> 00:05:01,250
very much.

98
00:05:03,116 --> 00:05:04,929
More than she may have expressed.

99
00:05:08,485 --> 00:05:09,767
What the hell was that?

100
00:05:10,426 --> 00:05:12,464
"Your grandmother
loves you very much"?

101
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,139
Did you see her face?

102
00:05:15,312 --> 00:05:18,108
- It was beautiful.
- No, it was a needless risk.

103
00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:20,444
An heirloom she carries with her.

104
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:23,674
That's a recent death,
and she's too young for dead parents.

105
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:26,219
- So... A grandparent.
- So what?

106
00:05:26,853 --> 00:05:28,003
I'd moved on.

107
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,860
It's a double act, kid.

108
00:05:30,098 --> 00:05:31,548
You don't fly solo.

109
00:05:31,673 --> 00:05:34,020
You're always saying,
when you're working strong, work strong,

110
00:05:34,145 --> 00:05:35,085
be brave.

111
00:05:35,284 --> 00:05:37,544
I was working strong,
and I was right.

112
00:05:38,931 --> 00:05:40,512
There is no "right"

113
00:05:40,637 --> 00:05:42,115
if there's no payoff.

114
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,725
This is showbusiness, not show art.

115
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:51,189
Your stage clothes
are walking by themselves.

116
00:05:51,314 --> 00:05:52,514
Wash'em good.

117
00:06:01,714 --> 00:06:03,177
That private reading...

118
00:06:07,141 --> 00:06:08,310
It came through.

119
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,026
You got it? When?

120
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,042
Tomorrow.
This is a big score, patty.

121
00:06:14,323 --> 00:06:16,476
Big enough for us
to blow off this outfit,

122
00:06:16,601 --> 00:06:17,983
step up in class

123
00:06:18,631 --> 00:06:21,181
and get ourselves some
new wheels, even.

124
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,403
Only one thing worries me.

125
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:28,731
It's you, my boy.

126
00:06:29,376 --> 00:06:30,431
Are you up to it?

127
00:06:31,127 --> 00:06:32,327
You know I am.

128
00:06:35,237 --> 00:06:36,495
Of course you are.

129
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:39,270
The boy wonder sees all.

130
00:06:44,086 --> 00:06:45,436
Can you stand up?

131
00:06:49,441 --> 00:06:50,529
Can you talk?

132
00:06:52,492 --> 00:06:53,704
Now that was talking.

133
00:06:54,338 --> 00:06:55,748
He needs to see a doctor.

134
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,752
I've never caught
a foul ball before.

135
00:07:00,877 --> 00:07:03,756
Technically, you still haven't.
Cho, you take him.

136
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:05,520
No. I'm fine.

137
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:09,011
- How many fingers?
- Six. Haven't we got a murder to solve?

138
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:10,554
You were unconscious.

139
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:12,492
- Jane, you were.
- Was not.

140
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:13,974
Your turn.

141
00:07:14,494 --> 00:07:16,194
Okay, I'll see a doctor.

142
00:07:17,206 --> 00:07:18,606
Excuse me, doctor?

143
00:07:21,423 --> 00:07:24,223
I know. Real, live patient.
I'm excited, too.

144
00:07:26,151 --> 00:07:28,320
Barney lived simple.
All work,

145
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,270
all the time, 24/7.

146
00:07:30,395 --> 00:07:32,659
Left his wife,
gave her the big house.

147
00:07:33,032 --> 00:07:35,990
A clean, simple life.
That's all he wanted.

148
00:07:36,346 --> 00:07:39,208
- Barney was married?
- Still is Leslie. A piece of work.

149
00:07:39,516 --> 00:07:42,011
Like I said,
he moved out a year ago.

150
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:44,686
After their son died.

151
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,134
He was 3,

152
00:07:49,661 --> 00:07:52,392
choked on a balloon.
Leslie just fell apart...

153
00:07:53,103 --> 00:07:56,114
Angry at barney, the whole world,
couldn't get past it.

154
00:07:56,419 --> 00:07:58,977
I called her this morning
after I called you.

155
00:07:59,307 --> 00:08:01,109
She wouldn't even pick up the phone.

156
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:04,983
Bad things happen,

157
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:06,902
and you deal with 'em.

158
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,108
Barney did?

159
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:09,905
He put his head down,

160
00:08:10,217 --> 00:08:13,113
went to work.
Found snake in the dominican and

161
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,701
Scotty somewhere in...

162
00:08:15,415 --> 00:08:18,258
Kansas.
Meanwhile, Leslie is stuck

163
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,323
living in a...
In a world of hurt.

164
00:08:25,531 --> 00:08:26,539
I feel it.

165
00:08:27,676 --> 00:08:29,949
Let's check out the wife...
Leslie Sloop.

166
00:08:34,862 --> 00:08:35,771
Working.

167
00:08:43,015 --> 00:08:44,539
Drinking like a fish,

168
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:46,683
picking up strangers,

169
00:08:47,387 --> 00:08:49,309
calling Barney at all hours,

170
00:08:49,555 --> 00:08:50,633
screaming...

171
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:53,073
I don't get that kind of anger.

172
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:55,649
Her kid died.

173
00:08:56,227 --> 00:08:58,704
- Is that gonna bring him back?
- You don't have kids.

174
00:09:00,175 --> 00:09:01,126
No, I don't.

175
00:09:02,797 --> 00:09:04,710
The ballplayers
should be heading in.

176
00:09:05,406 --> 00:09:07,750
With Barney dead,
i'm assuming that you get the,

177
00:09:07,972 --> 00:09:09,824
controlling interest in the academy.

178
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:12,660
- What's that got to do with it?
- Money...

179
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:14,636
Traditionally a very popular motive.

180
00:09:15,561 --> 00:09:16,388
Excuse me?

181
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,682
These two had their differences,
the gold watch,

182
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:22,111
the Italian suit, I'm sorry,
the Taiwanese suit made to look Italian.

183
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:27,090
- I don't have to listen to this.
- Not exactly emblems of the clean,

184
00:09:27,215 --> 00:09:29,067
simple life.
There was a culture clash?

185
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,113
Plus what is it exactly
you bring to the table?

186
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,990
Barney was the brains,

187
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,883
the real scout, the star...
I mean, the Sloop Academy.

188
00:09:40,531 --> 00:09:42,539
Jealousy... motive number two.

189
00:09:42,898 --> 00:09:44,976
I killed him.
I murdered my best friend.

190
00:09:45,101 --> 00:09:46,010
Did you?

191
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:49,144
- Get this jerk away from me.
- Seriously, get it off your chest.

192
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:51,548
- You'll feel a lot better.
- He was my friend!

193
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,989
How did that feel, crushing your friend's
skull with that bat? How that feel?

194
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,937
- Back off.
- I'm just checking him out.

195
00:09:59,062 --> 00:09:59,971
And?

196
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,726
Ambivalent reading, to be honest.

197
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,479
Maybe he did it.
Maybe he didn't.

198
00:10:05,804 --> 00:10:08,347
But one thing he does understand,
that's anger.

199
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:11,618
No offense.

200
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,537
- You think I can skip these interviews?
- Please.

201
00:10:29,771 --> 00:10:31,071
Scotty Sinclair?

202
00:10:32,139 --> 00:10:33,931
Doc Sinclair. He's 17.

203
00:10:34,263 --> 00:10:36,246
You're talkin' to him,
you're talkin' to me.

204
00:10:50,489 --> 00:10:52,389
Two, maybe three months ago,

205
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:55,388
I was having control trouble...

206
00:10:55,513 --> 00:10:56,513
My slider.

207
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,409
Mr. Sloop said I needed
to "quiet my brain."

208
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:04,454
We raked together in his garden.

209
00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:05,956
It worked.

210
00:11:10,023 --> 00:11:11,792
I would never hurt Mr. Sloop.

211
00:11:12,367 --> 00:11:13,755
He gave me everything.

212
00:11:14,444 --> 00:11:17,655
He brought me here.
He hooked me up with great coaches,

213
00:11:17,936 --> 00:11:19,011
regular school.

214
00:11:19,401 --> 00:11:22,806
And money to live on... An advance,
some kind of endorsement deal?

215
00:11:24,443 --> 00:11:26,013
Got, like, ten free pairs.

216
00:11:28,792 --> 00:11:31,273
Which we're gonna have to pay back
if he blows this showcase.

217
00:11:31,777 --> 00:11:32,816
Barney cared.

218
00:11:35,109 --> 00:11:37,828
He taught us how to handle money,
invest it.

219
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,116
He taught us how to handle life.

220
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:42,326
Are we done yet?

221
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,695
He's supposed to be
throwing right now.

222
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,699
Right, yeah. Got it.

223
00:11:48,086 --> 00:11:49,164
Thanks, Frank.

224
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:55,005
Barney's life insurance payout...
$20 million.

225
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:58,008
Let me guess...
Sole beneficiary leslie sloop.

226
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:00,517
$20 million...
That's a pretty good motive.

227
00:12:00,642 --> 00:12:02,095
For $20 million, i'd killyou.

228
00:12:03,815 --> 00:12:04,639
Really?

229
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:05,857
No, I mean,

230
00:12:06,372 --> 00:12:08,185
kidding.
It was a... Joke.

231
00:12:11,575 --> 00:12:12,975
Still the machine.

232
00:12:13,556 --> 00:12:14,727
Let's go see her.

233
00:12:18,887 --> 00:12:20,833
Someone needs parking lessons.

234
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:25,577
Who are you?

235
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,412
We're looking for Leslie Sloop.

236
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:30,196
Bitch ain't here, man,
and I called the real cops.

237
00:12:31,266 --> 00:12:33,645
- Hey, man, what took you?
- Hey, Narcisco!

238
00:12:33,973 --> 00:12:37,067
- Wait. You know him?
- You don't? Narcisco Rubrero...

239
00:12:38,496 --> 00:12:40,899
Walk-off homer,
game one, world series?

240
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,761
Help us out, Narcisco.
Where is she?

241
00:12:43,886 --> 00:12:45,788
Let's go downtown
and get a statement.

242
00:12:46,152 --> 00:12:48,179
Hold on, you guys.
We got dibs here.

243
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:49,855
She scratched my face.

244
00:12:50,605 --> 00:12:51,847
I think I'm bleedin'.

245
00:12:52,684 --> 00:12:56,108
She smashes her car,
so she steals mine... My lamborghini.

246
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,442
Where did she go?

247
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:00,779
I got a gun in that car.

248
00:13:01,119 --> 00:13:02,197
It's all legal.

249
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:03,865
I got, like, like, a permit.

250
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,784
Narcisco, where is she?

251
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:08,469
I don't know, man. She kept screaming
about her little angel.

252
00:13:08,594 --> 00:13:10,539
You know,
she had to see her little angel.

253
00:13:11,008 --> 00:13:12,290
The son... Michael.

254
00:13:16,018 --> 00:13:18,618
- She stole my car!
- So take it up with the real cops.

255
00:13:25,028 --> 00:13:26,844
Lisbon wants us back at the office.

256
00:13:36,054 --> 00:13:37,054
Wrong way.

257
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,041
What you doing?

258
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,391
They say there's no seasons
in California,

259
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,214
but that looks like fall.

260
00:14:16,464 --> 00:14:18,190
No, looks like you need a doctor.

261
00:14:18,867 --> 00:14:19,983
I am kind of dizzy.

262
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,331
Okay, hotshot.

263
00:14:35,883 --> 00:14:36,750
Female,

264
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,331
third in line.

265
00:14:42,512 --> 00:14:44,531
New mom, recently married.

266
00:14:44,656 --> 00:14:46,456
One of her first days out.

267
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,090
- He is gonna get her a better ring.
- Who is?

268
00:14:53,535 --> 00:14:54,685
Members only.

269
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,191
They had to get married.

270
00:15:04,662 --> 00:15:05,862
That's my boy.

271
00:15:07,357 --> 00:15:08,823
You have x-ray eyes.

272
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,242
No doubt about it.

273
00:15:22,871 --> 00:15:23,713
I'm okay.

274
00:15:32,843 --> 00:15:35,585
Snake and Scotty are about to pitch.
We can't miss that.

275
00:15:36,605 --> 00:15:38,205
Michael, I'm so sorry.

276
00:15:39,078 --> 00:15:40,278
What did I do?

277
00:15:47,466 --> 00:15:48,521
Mrs. Sloop?

278
00:15:50,548 --> 00:15:51,848
I'm with my son.

279
00:15:54,005 --> 00:15:57,099
Mrs. Sloop, I'm sorry. We need
to talk to you about your husband.

280
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,343
No. You need to go.

281
00:16:00,769 --> 00:16:02,011
Really, you do.

282
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,147
Don't you see?
This is private.

283
00:16:13,687 --> 00:16:15,796
I don't want to talk. I just...

284
00:16:17,115 --> 00:16:19,065
I just... I want to end this.

285
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:21,605
Please just leave me alone.

286
00:16:22,596 --> 00:16:24,065
I'm sorry. We can't do that.

287
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,984
You have to. Please.

288
00:16:28,429 --> 00:16:29,529
Because I...

289
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,524
I don't know what else to do.

290
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:35,160
Mrs. Sloop.

291
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,454
Oh, my god. I'm so sorry.

292
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:39,429
I've never had children.

293
00:16:39,804 --> 00:16:42,218
I can't even begin
to imagine your loss.

294
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,794
No, you can't.
So just stop.

295
00:16:47,289 --> 00:16:49,442
Please just leave me alone.

296
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,159
Just stop talking.

297
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,888
I'm not going to stop.
I can't.

298
00:16:59,532 --> 00:17:01,478
My sister.
She was just like you.

299
00:17:02,982 --> 00:17:04,397
I don't want to hear this.

300
00:17:04,665 --> 00:17:06,458
She wanted it to be over...

301
00:17:07,606 --> 00:17:08,485
Forher.

302
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:12,822
It was always about her.

303
00:17:13,294 --> 00:17:14,866
She couldn't talk to me.

304
00:17:15,216 --> 00:17:16,266
About what?

305
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:17,786
About anything.

306
00:17:18,685 --> 00:17:19,935
I'm her sister.

307
00:17:20,853 --> 00:17:21,966
But she didn't

308
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:23,875
not to me, not to anybody.

309
00:17:26,454 --> 00:17:28,435
She just ended it forher.

310
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,314
I don't know what else to do.

311
00:17:35,271 --> 00:17:36,396
Give me the gun.

312
00:17:40,368 --> 00:17:41,470
Put it down.

313
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:45,355
You don't want to do this.
Not here.

314
00:17:45,891 --> 00:17:47,215
Give me the gun.

315
00:17:51,235 --> 00:17:52,946
I'm so sorry, Michael.

316
00:17:53,745 --> 00:17:55,195
Come on. It's okay.

317
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,455
Not now. You know that.

318
00:18:07,355 --> 00:18:08,605
Look, I'm busy here.

319
00:18:08,898 --> 00:18:10,574
Your brother's tryout is today.

320
00:18:13,023 --> 00:18:13,932
No way.

321
00:18:22,183 --> 00:18:23,706
That's my older boy.

322
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:26,671
He's a pitcher, just like Snake.

323
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:29,795
He's just as good, too.

324
00:18:30,378 --> 00:18:31,359
But he's 22.

325
00:18:32,124 --> 00:18:34,069
In baseball years, he's an old man.

326
00:18:35,171 --> 00:18:37,407
These pro teams,
they like'em young these days.

327
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:38,598
Like Snake...

328
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:41,176
plenty of time for improvement.

329
00:18:46,567 --> 00:18:48,585
We caught a break.
The wife looks good for it.

330
00:18:51,637 --> 00:18:52,589
What was that?

331
00:18:52,856 --> 00:18:55,246
Was that a fork,
did he just throw a forkball?

332
00:18:55,383 --> 00:18:56,403
It was a slider.

333
00:18:56,528 --> 00:18:58,386
We gotta go.
We go to take a look at the wife.

334
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,463
Slider?

335
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,940
You know, i'm still a little dizzy.

336
00:19:03,015 --> 00:19:05,598
You go.
Really, I'll get a ride.

337
00:19:06,571 --> 00:19:08,129
People love driving with me.

338
00:19:11,586 --> 00:19:13,180
Couldn't find sunflowers.

339
00:19:14,094 --> 00:19:15,324
Not quite the same.

340
00:19:16,824 --> 00:19:18,490
Leslie, where were you last night?

341
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,172
We went to the movies.
I don't...

342
00:19:22,098 --> 00:19:23,953
I don't remember which one.

343
00:19:24,755 --> 00:19:26,831
You should not take these
when you're drinking.

344
00:19:27,114 --> 00:19:28,458
It was so loud...

345
00:19:28,783 --> 00:19:30,794
there were guns and helicopters

346
00:19:31,153 --> 00:19:32,673
and people screaming.

347
00:19:33,283 --> 00:19:35,017
There was so much screaming.

348
00:19:36,023 --> 00:19:38,301
Darn. These are supposed
to keep me calm.

349
00:19:39,738 --> 00:19:40,804
Just one a day.

350
00:19:41,285 --> 00:19:43,570
That's what the doctor said.
That'll do the trick.

351
00:19:44,168 --> 00:19:46,675
- Did you go see barney last night?
- To see barney?

352
00:19:48,633 --> 00:19:49,542
Mr. Zen?

353
00:19:50,402 --> 00:19:51,652
Mr. Acceptance?

354
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:56,332
Why would I do that?

355
00:19:59,286 --> 00:20:00,865
<i>Tell us about Narcisco.</i>

356
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:01,983
<i>Narcisco?</i>

357
00:20:07,914 --> 00:20:09,958
<i>He's one of Barney's players.</i>

358
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:13,434
<i>I sometimes slept with those guys.
Did you know that?</i>

359
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,602
<i>I did that sometimes</i>

360
00:20:16,387 --> 00:20:17,590
<i>to make him mad.</i>

361
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:20,927
<i>He didn't even care.</i>

362
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,223
She's going around and around,

363
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,371
but I think she's gonna give it up.

364
00:20:28,778 --> 00:20:30,812
I thought you were amazing

365
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,188
out there today.

366
00:20:32,754 --> 00:20:34,293
I just wanted to tell you that.

367
00:20:35,695 --> 00:20:37,133
Thank you, I guess.

368
00:20:38,586 --> 00:20:40,286
Can I ask you something?

369
00:20:40,661 --> 00:20:41,912
I don't have a sister.

370
00:20:43,673 --> 00:20:45,173
I didn't remember one....

371
00:20:45,864 --> 00:20:46,773
It just.

372
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,490
Came out.

373
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,114
What was that?

374
00:21:06,492 --> 00:21:08,496
Come on, Scotty!
What are you thinkin'?

375
00:21:10,172 --> 00:21:12,047
He gets down on him too much.

376
00:21:13,158 --> 00:21:14,365
The boy can throw.

377
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:16,137
He can hit, too.

378
00:21:16,395 --> 00:21:18,493
Last night in the cage,
he dinged me three times

379
00:21:18,821 --> 00:21:19,969
off my slider.

380
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,680
Nobody touches my slider.

381
00:21:21,805 --> 00:21:23,658
That man is gonna
kill the golden goose.

382
00:21:23,904 --> 00:21:25,697
Scotty plays like this now, imagine

383
00:21:25,822 --> 00:21:27,912
when he's 18 or 20 years old.

384
00:21:28,394 --> 00:21:29,870
He's only gonna get better.

385
00:21:30,743 --> 00:21:31,868
It's amazing?

386
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:50,801
There.

387
00:21:54,528 --> 00:21:58,232
I spent three long days
at that crummy hospital

388
00:21:59,071 --> 00:22:00,421
finding the mark,

389
00:22:01,228 --> 00:22:02,728
setting up the play.

390
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:05,239
And now...

391
00:22:06,134 --> 00:22:07,466
It's time to get paid.

392
00:22:37,842 --> 00:22:39,232
We've been waiting for you.

393
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,993
How you doing?

394
00:22:42,733 --> 00:22:43,528
Go, Cho!

395
00:22:44,075 --> 00:22:45,307
CBI! Stop!

396
00:22:46,221 --> 00:22:47,490
Get back here! Police!

397
00:23:08,783 --> 00:23:10,555
We talked to five bars
near the beach.

398
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:12,879
Nothing.

399
00:23:17,048 --> 00:23:19,876
After the movies,
I had an argument with Narcisco,

400
00:23:20,001 --> 00:23:21,458
and I went to Barney's.

401
00:23:23,431 --> 00:23:24,819
He was sleeping...

402
00:23:25,527 --> 00:23:26,727
In his garden.

403
00:23:27,768 --> 00:23:29,443
He wouldn't even talk to me.

404
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,489
- Leslie...
- I'm his wife!

405
00:23:32,804 --> 00:23:35,830
I'm the mother of his child.
Shouldn't he talk to me?

406
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:45,965
She was there that night,
but he was already dead?

407
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,933
If they were at a 10:00 movie,
it adds up.

408
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:50,762
She knew he was dead.
That's what pushed her over the edge.

409
00:23:51,979 --> 00:23:53,199
<i>I didn't kill him.</i>

410
00:23:54,256 --> 00:23:56,057
<i>I couldn't, even if I wanted to.</i>

411
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,627
<i>What would I tell Michael?</i>

412
00:24:01,248 --> 00:24:02,481
You should let her go.

413
00:24:02,651 --> 00:24:05,318
Where? Even if she didn't kill him,
she needs help.

414
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:09,108
Your pants are ripped.

415
00:24:09,233 --> 00:24:11,115
We found a witness
with immigration problems.

416
00:24:12,085 --> 00:24:13,201
A baseball player.

417
00:24:13,531 --> 00:24:15,244
He was very angry with Mr. Sloop.

418
00:24:15,415 --> 00:24:18,289
Yesterday afternoon?
He was yelling... Loud.

419
00:24:18,674 --> 00:24:20,500
He say Mr. Sloop was stealing.

420
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:22,376
And Mr. Sloop...
He was very quiet.

421
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:24,828
He was trying to walk away,
but the baseball player...

422
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:27,715
- He followed him, very angry.
- That's it?

423
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,565
Mr. Sloop, he went into his trailer.

424
00:24:32,874 --> 00:24:34,721
Then he come out
and he show him some papers.

425
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:38,295
And then the baseball player,
he got quiet. And that's when I left.

426
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,700
But he'd recognize the player
if he saw him again.

427
00:24:48,058 --> 00:24:50,359
<i>All right,
line up facing the mirror.</i>

428
00:24:55,061 --> 00:24:57,222
It's the biggest day of their lives.
You get that?

429
00:24:57,347 --> 00:25:00,059
Barney Sloop had
his head bashed in, Mr. Gallidos.

430
00:25:00,511 --> 00:25:02,101
Big day for him, too.

431
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:21,060
- Him.
- You sure?

432
00:25:22,118 --> 00:25:23,175
Him at the end.

433
00:25:24,553 --> 00:25:26,190
It's just not true.

434
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,158
- Dad...
- I've got this.

435
00:25:31,374 --> 00:25:32,603
My boy doesn't lie.

436
00:25:32,728 --> 00:25:34,907
- If he said he didn't...
- I did.

437
00:25:36,911 --> 00:25:39,744
I went to see him, all right?
But, I mean, I didn't kill him.

438
00:25:40,033 --> 00:25:42,330
- What were you arguing about?
- I don't believe it.

439
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:45,153
- You lied to me?
- Mr. Sinclair, please.

440
00:25:45,628 --> 00:25:47,826
I'm sorry to disappoint you, dad.

441
00:25:49,994 --> 00:25:52,800
What were you arguing about?
What did Barney steal?

442
00:25:53,126 --> 00:25:55,796
He's not saying one word,
because we're leaving now.

443
00:25:56,062 --> 00:25:57,006
Mr. Fitch...

444
00:25:57,131 --> 00:26:00,842
Scotty had an argument
with Barney hours before the murder.

445
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:03,102
You got nothing to hold him on.

446
00:26:03,696 --> 00:26:04,605
Not yet.

447
00:26:14,937 --> 00:26:18,757
He had an argument with Barney.
He was angry. He lied about it.

448
00:26:19,426 --> 00:26:22,454
Who's to say Scotty didn't go back
that night and kill the guy?

449
00:26:22,624 --> 00:26:23,729
The kid didn't do it.

450
00:26:23,854 --> 00:26:25,746
He was angry with his dad,
not with Sloop.

451
00:26:25,956 --> 00:26:28,419
If you think he did it,
then check the cameras.

452
00:26:28,876 --> 00:26:29,976
What camera?

453
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,089
The baseball field cameras.

454
00:26:32,692 --> 00:26:35,168
Snake let slip that he and Scotty
were out there last night.

455
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:38,486
Apparently, Scotty handled
Snake's slider very well.

456
00:26:40,481 --> 00:26:42,490
- You sure you're all right?
- Yeah, fine.

457
00:26:43,336 --> 00:26:46,311
Security cam.
Should be time-stamped.

458
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:50,183
The guy who manages
the multiplex in Castine City...

459
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:52,411
He rembers a drunk couple
fighting in the lobby.

460
00:26:52,536 --> 00:26:54,811
The woman was screaming about
the movie being too loud.

461
00:26:54,936 --> 00:26:56,822
10:00 show.
Sound familiar?

462
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,118
Go and show him
a picture of Leslie and Narcisco.

463
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:01,744
If he ids them,
that lets them out, too.

464
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:04,954
We're clearing people.
We're supposed to be catching them.

465
00:27:16,233 --> 00:27:17,678
We've tried everything.

466
00:27:18,808 --> 00:27:21,940
She finished her fourth course
of chemo last week.

467
00:27:23,638 --> 00:27:26,438
And then the tumors
in her lungs are growing.

468
00:27:28,365 --> 00:27:29,438
Cool shirt.

469
00:27:30,862 --> 00:27:31,732
Thank you.

470
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:43,119
Now the doctors say
there's nothing they can do,

471
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:45,288
just make her comfortable.

472
00:27:46,142 --> 00:27:47,402
I know it...

473
00:27:49,823 --> 00:27:51,124
Must be difficult.

474
00:27:51,698 --> 00:27:53,629
So when I heard about the crystal...

475
00:27:56,332 --> 00:27:57,365
The crystal.

476
00:28:18,095 --> 00:28:19,524
Does it really work?

477
00:28:22,961 --> 00:28:24,744
Will it shrink the tumors?

478
00:28:27,136 --> 00:28:28,045
Observe.

479
00:28:29,446 --> 00:28:30,708
Decide for yourself.

480
00:28:39,157 --> 00:28:40,066
Patrick?

481
00:28:52,927 --> 00:28:53,844
Son?

482
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:00,938
I'm sorry.

483
00:29:06,224 --> 00:29:07,161
What's wrong?

484
00:29:08,753 --> 00:29:09,729
He...

485
00:29:09,854 --> 00:29:12,188
It's a stressful process.

486
00:29:13,687 --> 00:29:15,127
He just needs some air.

487
00:29:17,369 --> 00:29:18,630
Won't be long.

488
00:29:26,883 --> 00:29:28,331
Get up and get back in there.

489
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,671
- I can't do it.
- Get up now.

490
00:29:30,796 --> 00:29:32,496
- I can't.
- What part?

491
00:29:33,388 --> 00:29:35,146
What part can't you do?

492
00:29:35,901 --> 00:29:36,810
The gag?

493
00:29:37,156 --> 00:29:39,011
That's easy.
I did the hard part.

494
00:29:39,136 --> 00:29:40,540
I put the money in the tent.

495
00:29:40,665 --> 00:29:43,072
- All you gotta do is pick it up.
- She's dying.

496
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:46,617
We're stealing from a dying girl.

497
00:29:47,629 --> 00:29:48,922
We're all dying, kid.

498
00:29:49,255 --> 00:29:51,265
We're all dying.
But what we're giving her...

499
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,081
Because yeah,
she'll be dead by tuesday

500
00:29:53,251 --> 00:29:55,470
and needs it more than most is hope.

501
00:29:57,483 --> 00:29:59,552
- Do you get that?
- I can't do it.

502
00:30:04,977 --> 00:30:07,494
All right. You're either
with the show, or you're not.

503
00:30:08,591 --> 00:30:09,864
You're a loser,

504
00:30:10,425 --> 00:30:13,054
or you're someone
who plays the losers.

505
00:30:13,274 --> 00:30:15,462
And you can't just back out
when you feel like it,

506
00:30:15,587 --> 00:30:18,615
when it's morally convenient,
when you don't have the guts.

507
00:30:18,868 --> 00:30:22,241
I've never backed out.
I've been carrying you for a long time,

508
00:30:22,366 --> 00:30:24,447
and it's not gettin'any easier, son.

509
00:30:24,754 --> 00:30:26,946
No one like an aging boy psychic.

510
00:30:27,071 --> 00:30:29,535
Short pants don't look so good
on a kid that needs a shave.

511
00:30:31,443 --> 00:30:32,375
Now...

512
00:30:34,656 --> 00:30:36,120
You're gonna need a new act.

513
00:30:38,115 --> 00:30:40,572
You're gonna work that out
all by yourself?

514
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:42,889
You going solo?

515
00:30:46,476 --> 00:30:47,602
Yes or no, boy?

516
00:30:48,785 --> 00:30:50,625
Are you with it?
Are you with me?

517
00:30:50,906 --> 00:30:52,850
Right now.
You gotta say. Come on.

518
00:31:09,254 --> 00:31:11,694
7:21...
That's the last time we see 'em.

519
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:14,955
Either one of them could have
gone back to Barney's.

520
00:31:15,617 --> 00:31:16,832
Where you going?

521
00:31:17,001 --> 00:31:20,338
Baseball academy, I was thinking.
Don't we have to solve this thing?

522
00:31:20,463 --> 00:31:22,713
Rigsby and Van Pelt are talking
to the theater manager.

523
00:31:22,838 --> 00:31:24,832
The wife? No, it wasn't her.

524
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:26,688
The murder weapon
was a baseball bat.

525
00:31:26,813 --> 00:31:29,186
Baseball bat, baseball academy...

526
00:31:29,528 --> 00:31:30,678
common sense.

527
00:31:31,406 --> 00:31:33,682
- Do you know who the killer is?
- What do you think?

528
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,245
You said, "What do you think?",
to make me think you do

529
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:38,518
so I'll go with you,
but really you don't.

530
00:31:39,844 --> 00:31:40,606
Cho?

531
00:31:40,775 --> 00:31:43,192
Baseball bat, baseball academy.
That's not common sense.

532
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,610
Great. We'll all go.

533
00:31:51,775 --> 00:31:54,397
All right, fellas, fellas,
listen up here a minute, please.

534
00:31:54,845 --> 00:31:56,145
Before we start,

535
00:31:57,254 --> 00:32:00,019
I just want to say a few words
about Barney Sloop.

536
00:32:01,873 --> 00:32:03,541
He was a great partner,

537
00:32:04,542 --> 00:32:06,045
a great friend to all of us.

538
00:32:06,551 --> 00:32:07,687
And most of all,

539
00:32:08,553 --> 00:32:11,387
a great friend to the game
of baseball itself.

540
00:32:13,745 --> 00:32:15,672
Let us bow our heads.

541
00:32:20,172 --> 00:32:21,146
Okay then.

542
00:32:22,064 --> 00:32:25,109
That brings us to Snake Gallidos
and Scotty Sinclair...

543
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:28,195
Barney's last and maybe
his greatest discoveries...

544
00:32:28,364 --> 00:32:30,948
Two pitchers
with huge franchise potential.

545
00:32:31,512 --> 00:32:33,033
In a few minutes, guys,

546
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:35,035
you're gonna see the future.

547
00:32:35,448 --> 00:32:36,448
Meanwhile,

548
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,872
grab some food and a beer

549
00:32:40,286 --> 00:32:42,751
and make sure
you've brought your checkbooks.

550
00:32:46,711 --> 00:32:48,049
What are you doing here?

551
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,875
We thought you might be
relieved to know

552
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,127
that we know you're innocent,

553
00:32:53,527 --> 00:32:54,760
so you can relax.

554
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,932
Go out there and be great.

555
00:32:57,494 --> 00:33:00,003
- You're gonna be superstars.
- That's right, baby.

556
00:33:00,128 --> 00:33:02,155
Women, cars, adulation,

557
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:04,825
buckets of money all there for you.

558
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:08,035
So who cares if your dad steals
a little here and there?

559
00:33:10,731 --> 00:33:11,905
He didn't steal.

560
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:12,982
Really?

561
00:33:14,652 --> 00:33:16,285
He just set up a new bank account.

562
00:33:19,258 --> 00:33:21,416
That's what Barney told you
when you went over there

563
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,526
and argued,
to accuse him of stealing.

564
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,211
That your dad opened a new account
without telling you.

565
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,880
I don't think you're helping here.

566
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:30,506
Yes, you two, you have the gift.

567
00:33:31,096 --> 00:33:32,806
The question is this...

568
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:35,188
What are you gonna do
with that gift?

569
00:33:36,488 --> 00:33:37,598
Play baseball?

570
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:39,519
That's right.
You're gonna play baseball.

571
00:33:39,644 --> 00:33:42,244
You're gonna sell soap.
You're gonna be part of the big machine.

572
00:33:42,369 --> 00:33:44,519
Not soap, man.
My own cologne...

573
00:33:44,738 --> 00:33:45,647
"Snake

574
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:46,982
for men."

575
00:33:47,203 --> 00:33:48,233
That sounds good.

576
00:33:48,471 --> 00:33:51,195
So we sell ourselves.
I mean, what else are we gonna do?

577
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:54,556
I'm just saying be careful
that you sell your talent

578
00:33:54,681 --> 00:33:55,939
and not your soul.

579
00:33:56,064 --> 00:33:58,492
Don't let other people run
your lives, not even your dads.

580
00:33:58,617 --> 00:34:00,704
And trust me,
I know what I'm talking about.

581
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:01,822
Oh, yeah?

582
00:34:03,145 --> 00:34:04,833
What's your talent, old man?

583
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:05,912
Me?

584
00:34:09,386 --> 00:34:10,404
I read minds,

585
00:34:10,529 --> 00:34:12,856
and there's been plenty of times
that I've misused that.

586
00:34:12,981 --> 00:34:14,722
Read minds, man?
Get real.

587
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:16,428
I am real.

588
00:34:16,986 --> 00:34:19,409
Just like most people read books,

589
00:34:19,534 --> 00:34:21,249
I read minds.

590
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:22,976
What am I thinking?

591
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:25,542
"Holy crap,
I hope he can't really read minds.

592
00:34:25,667 --> 00:34:27,980
Otherwise I'd be
in deep trouble right now."

593
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:28,941
Right?

594
00:34:31,608 --> 00:34:34,487
Cho, could you hand me
that pencil, please?

595
00:34:37,664 --> 00:34:39,182
Scotty, concentrate.

596
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:41,449
Think of your birthday.
Don't tell me.

597
00:34:41,574 --> 00:34:42,924
Month, day, year.

598
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:44,934
Concentrate.

599
00:34:45,881 --> 00:34:48,502
- All right, I'm doing it.
- He's messing with us, man.

600
00:34:48,835 --> 00:34:50,541
Come on, we need to go out there.

601
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,108
I'm reading his mind.

602
00:35:03,767 --> 00:35:04,917
Okay, got it.

603
00:35:12,791 --> 00:35:14,236
What's your birthday, Scotty?

604
00:35:15,111 --> 00:35:16,713
April 10,'92.

605
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,265
April 10,'92.

606
00:35:20,167 --> 00:35:22,935
Now how much money you want
to bet that I can't read minds?

607
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,488
You're gonna be
a big shot baseball player,

608
00:35:25,613 --> 00:35:27,349
make a lot of money.

609
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:29,795
How much of that money
are you willing to bet

610
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,671
- that I can't read minds?
- No way.

611
00:35:32,996 --> 00:35:34,718
Snake, you want in on the action?

612
00:35:34,843 --> 00:35:36,884
Cho's not going near it.
He knows better.

613
00:35:37,447 --> 00:35:40,012
Show it to me.
No way. Come on. Show it.

614
00:35:46,442 --> 00:35:47,773
Okay, that's sick.

615
00:35:48,914 --> 00:35:50,230
Maybe he read it somewhere.

616
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:51,998
Snake, it's my talent.

617
00:35:52,592 --> 00:35:53,712
You want to try?

618
00:35:55,155 --> 00:35:56,904
Your birthday.
Just think of it.

619
00:36:00,272 --> 00:36:01,763
I got to warm up, man.

620
00:36:02,386 --> 00:36:03,201
Let's go.

621
00:36:03,326 --> 00:36:04,953
All right. Maybe another time.

622
00:36:05,721 --> 00:36:06,622
Good luck.

623
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:08,355
- Thanks.
- You, too.

624
00:36:12,498 --> 00:36:14,967
- What was that about?
- Just confirming a hunch.

625
00:36:25,921 --> 00:36:26,830
You okay?

626
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:28,675
Yeah, I'm fine.

627
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,787
Just give me a minute,
I'll close this thing.

628
00:36:30,978 --> 00:36:32,480
My dad hated baseball.

629
00:36:32,605 --> 00:36:33,881
You gotta get over that.

630
00:36:34,006 --> 00:36:36,290
Probably never would have made
the big leagues anyway.

631
00:36:44,152 --> 00:36:46,402
This crystal is from ancient Egypt.

632
00:36:47,157 --> 00:36:49,653
Its healing powers are legendary.

633
00:36:50,758 --> 00:36:52,458
Where there is sickness,

634
00:36:53,273 --> 00:36:54,480
it brings health.

635
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:58,344
This may be hard to watch.

636
00:37:00,597 --> 00:37:01,687
No, don't!

637
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:09,309
And when the crystal is applied...

638
00:37:11,976 --> 00:37:13,671
The burn is healed.

639
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:21,613
The same thing happens
with the tumors.

640
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:23,407
They just disappear.

641
00:37:23,777 --> 00:37:24,777
I want it.

642
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:27,619
Ma'am, we are here
for the next three days.

643
00:37:28,007 --> 00:37:30,290
You can have as many
appointments as you like.

644
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,135
I want the crystal.
I want to buy it.

645
00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:36,879
That's not possible.

646
00:37:37,983 --> 00:37:39,006
I brought cash.

647
00:37:40,415 --> 00:37:42,259
I'm sorry.
It's been in our family

648
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:44,717
for the past six generations.
I can't.

649
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,388
Please!

650
00:37:47,101 --> 00:37:48,223
I'm truly sorry.

651
00:37:48,637 --> 00:37:49,308
Dad,

652
00:37:50,346 --> 00:37:51,476
she needs it.

653
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,164
Just give it to her!

654
00:37:59,514 --> 00:38:00,360
Please!

655
00:38:02,336 --> 00:38:03,636
I'm begging you.

656
00:38:12,065 --> 00:38:13,540
10 grand, my son.

657
00:38:14,222 --> 00:38:15,897
You were great in there.

658
00:38:16,022 --> 00:38:17,072
The crying,

659
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:20,047
that was fantastic.
I almost bought it myself.

660
00:38:23,189 --> 00:38:24,554
You earned this...

661
00:38:25,507 --> 00:38:26,631
every penny.

662
00:38:29,321 --> 00:38:31,012
I'm gonna be a little late tonight.

663
00:38:31,137 --> 00:38:33,560
The sideshow boys
got a little poker going.

664
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,637
So...

665
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:36,525
Wish me luck.

666
00:38:55,493 --> 00:38:57,335
You left before
I got to read your mind.

667
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,419
What?
Go away now, we got to focus.

668
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:01,665
I was just trying
to get his date of birth.

669
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:02,890
March 5,'92.

670
00:39:04,281 --> 00:39:05,281
You happy?

671
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,004
March 5,'92. That's weird.

672
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:11,932
I got the march 5th bit right,
but I got the, year wrong.

673
00:39:12,857 --> 00:39:14,707
I'm never off by that much.

674
00:39:14,953 --> 00:39:15,852
Five years.

675
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,146
What are you doing?

676
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:21,149
That would make you 22 years old.

677
00:39:21,698 --> 00:39:22,904
Get out of here.

678
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:25,721
That's the same age as your brother.
Carlos, isn't it?

679
00:39:25,846 --> 00:39:27,543
Shut your mouth!
Get outta here!

680
00:39:27,668 --> 00:39:30,158
- Take it easy.
- Barney found out, didn't he?

681
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:34,830
He found out that Snake was 22.
He was gonna send him home.

682
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:37,207
Shut your mouth.
What the hell's going on here?

683
00:39:37,721 --> 00:39:40,767
Jupiter killed Barney
to conceal Snake's real age.

684
00:39:41,654 --> 00:39:43,549
Holy crap.
Is this true?

685
00:39:46,329 --> 00:39:47,822
<i>I tried to reason with him,</i>

686
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:49,897
<i>but he just walked away.</i>

687
00:39:56,454 --> 00:39:58,631
<i>Don't say a word, Snake.
No digas nada.</i>

688
00:39:59,823 --> 00:40:02,274
He doesn't know nothing.
Nothing about what?

689
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:03,442
Holy crap.

690
00:40:04,275 --> 00:40:06,528
I didn't do nothing.
I'm not saying nothing.

691
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:08,406
Come on.
Let's be honest here.

692
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:10,560
We'll let your kid throw.
Right, Mr. Fitch?

693
00:40:13,795 --> 00:40:15,402
How old are you really, kid?

694
00:40:15,825 --> 00:40:16,869
On the bible.

695
00:40:20,229 --> 00:40:21,138
22.

696
00:40:21,837 --> 00:40:23,145
You might have a shot...

697
00:40:24,244 --> 00:40:25,672
Middle reliever maybe.

698
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,052
If you double my cut, he can throw.

699
00:40:32,573 --> 00:40:33,482
Deal.

700
00:40:34,029 --> 00:40:35,515
Put your hands behind your back.

701
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:38,383
You're under arrest for the murder
of Barney Sloop.

702
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,040
Man up, kid.

703
00:40:43,897 --> 00:40:45,524
Remember to keep the ball low.

704
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:47,569
You get in trouble,
throw'em the slider.

705
00:40:56,589 --> 00:40:58,356
I just feel a little bit dizzy.

706
00:41:01,178 --> 00:41:02,750
I'm just gonna take a knee.

707
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:05,119
I'm good.

708
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:14,721
Strike three. You're out.

709
00:41:19,001 --> 00:41:20,676
You got lucky on that one.

710
00:41:20,801 --> 00:41:22,813
I struck him out.
You set him up with the heater.

711
00:41:23,085 --> 00:41:25,398
You don't use it for an out,
not in that situation.

712
00:41:26,507 --> 00:41:29,395
I struck him out.
We'll talk about this later.

713
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:33,240
I'm gonna make our deal.

714
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:35,599
You won't.

715
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,386
I hired an agent.

716
00:41:49,942 --> 00:41:51,296
Let's go see a doctor.

717
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,957
Why? Are you feeling unwell?

718
00:41:54,082 --> 00:41:56,972
No, you are.
Cho said you almost fainted.

719
00:41:57,611 --> 00:41:59,034
I was just pretending.

720
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:01,592
I hate these kind of dramatic scenes.
Poor kid.

721
00:42:01,717 --> 00:42:03,562
Liar. You just don't want
to go to the doctor.

722
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:06,857
What's a doctor gonna say?
"You banged your head. Be careful."

723
00:42:07,138 --> 00:42:08,928
You might need an M.R.I.

724
00:42:09,053 --> 00:42:11,160
Now you're really selling it.
Sounds great.

725
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:13,746
Are you okay?

726
00:42:15,195 --> 00:42:16,345
Just kidding.
