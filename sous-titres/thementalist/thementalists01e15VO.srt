1
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,600
Wow, Scarlett just throws the best parties.

2
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,960
- I'm gonna go find Asra.  - Then I'll see who I can find.

3
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,500
There's Victor.

4
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,600
Aah!

5
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,630
Scarlett!

6
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,730
Scarlett!

7
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,800
Call an ambulance!

8
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,060
Mom.

9
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:06,300
No, Oscar, stay up there!

10
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,600
Look at it, George.

11
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:13,330
Beautiful, isn't it?

12
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,260
Now relax.

13
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:20,630
Don't you feel happy and relaxed?

14
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,630
Yes.

15
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,660
Say it. Tell me how you feel.

16
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:28,000
Happy and relaxed.

17
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,260
That's good.

18
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:34,500
That's very good.

19
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,100
So tell me, George, what's your date of birth?

20
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,630
I was born on the 1st of March...

21
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,000
1980.

22
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,500
And what's your mother's name?

23
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,930
Melody.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,200
That's... that's a very nice name.

25
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,830
She was a good woman.

26
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,960
She liked you to tell the truth, didn't she, George?

27
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,530
Yes.

28
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,600
So tell me, how did you murder Donovan Hobar...

29
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,130
Jane, I'm sorry to interrupt,

30
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,400
but we just caught a red ball.

31
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,230
- You gonna be much longer with this one?  - Uh...

32
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,330
Damn it, Jane. He's in a trance, isn't he?

33
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,360
Wha... I-I'd describe it

34
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,230
- more as a-a deep relaxation.  - Hypnotized. You hypnotized him.

35
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,400
- Well, I was doing a favor for the Organized Crime Unit.  - Those cowboys?

36
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,730
- Time to go, guys.  - You know, I was just about to get the truth out of him.

37
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,030
Uh, he killed two people. If you walk very quietly to the door,

38
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,860
- I still might...  - How many times have I told you... no hypnotism?

39
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,660
It's illegal, and it's unethical,

40
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:35,560
- and you cannot keep on doing it.  - Just calm yourself, woman. It's no big thing.

41
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,560
Oh, really? This man's lawyer is right this minute

42
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,060
coming down the hallway, wearing a mean face.

43
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:44,060
Something tells me he'll argue that point with you. Let's go.

44
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,060
- Well, let me get him out of his trance first, huh?  - Well, be quick about it.

45
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,230
Yes, ma'am.

46
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,200
- I'd like to speak to my client alone.  - Of course.

47
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:57,200
- Now.  - George, nice to talk to you.

48
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,930
Good luck with all your future endeavors.

49
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,200
That's mine.

50
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:08,030
So, George...

51
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,200
George?

52
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,100
Are you all right?

53
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,400
- It's not funny.  - It is a little.

54
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,900
What do you got?

55
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,400
Unincorporated country club development outside of town,

56
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,400
Scarlett Marquesa, 33, female.

57
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,130
Hostess of the party, married, one kid.

58
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,130
Right about 10:20 this evening, the party was in full swing.

59
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,130
Scarlett comes running over the balcony,

60
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,260
clutching her throat and screaming.

61
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:34,230
- She falls down to her death.  - Where's the husband and the kid?

62
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,860
- They're with neighbors, badly shook up.  - We'll wait to talk to them until tomorrow morning.

63
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,930
- Poison, huh?  - Must be. Frothing at the lips, discoloration.

64
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,930
The medical examiner thinks so, too.

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,600
But we haven't found the source yet.

66
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,830
We don't know where she ingested the poison.

67
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,330
She came from up there, but the actual poisoning

68
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,630
could've taken place anywhere. It's a big house.

69
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,000
Uh, just a moment. Excuse me.

70
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,800
That's interesting.

71
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,660
Look. Look at her eyes.

72
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:03,930
What?

73
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,730
Hello? Use your words.

74
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,730
She had more mascara on her right eye

75
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,730
than she did on her left,

76
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,730
which means that she was halfway through reapplying her makeup

77
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,730
when she was poisoned, so...

78
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,600
she was in the...

79
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,760
bathroom.

80
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,660
Hmm.

81
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,930
Ah.

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,330
Ah. The source of the poison,

83
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,500
I have no doubt.

84
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,360
What do we got here?

85
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,500
Motive.

86
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,430
Mr. Marquesa, I'm Agent Lisbon, CBI.

87
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,230
Yes, thanks for coming.

88
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,030
These are dear friends, Asra Hadami and Mandy Riljek.

89
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,200
They've been looking after me and Oscar.

90
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,360
- Anything we can do.  - Vic, I'll make sure Jim stops by

91
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:10,630
- As soon as he gets back into town.  - Thanks, Mandy.

92
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,200
Okay. Take care, Victor.

93
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,800
Please. Come in.

94
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,600
Scarlett kept everything in here.

95
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,100
Very organized.

96
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,100
We'll get it back to you just as soon as we can.

97
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,660
Thank you.

98
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:45,060
The tox screen tells us your wife's drink was laced

99
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:47,060
With rat poison.

100
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,160
Rat poison.

101
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,660
- Oscar. Oscar.  - Argh! Argh!

102
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:55,330
- Argh!  - Who would do such a thing?

103
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,760
- Somebody who wanted to get even?  - Who's your guess?

104
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,760
Whose name just popped into your head?

105
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:02,700
Scarlett had no enemies. Everyone loved Scarlett.

106
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,630
Even Asra?

107
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,300
Asra? Yes, they got along fine. Why ask about her?

108
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,000
- You're having an affair with Asra, aren't you?  - What? No.

109
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,260
- No? Really?  - No. Really.

110
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,700
And what the heck kind of police are you, anyhow,

111
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,700
Asking me a question like that?

112
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,700
Sorry, my mistake. You are business partners?

113
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,830
- She's my accounts manager.  - Ah, okay. Now I understand.

114
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,860
- Understand what?  - Doesn't matter. Do you know where her keys are?

115
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:31,330
- I can't find 'em. They're not in here.  - I couldn't find them. I wanted to move her car.

116
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,000
Not to worry. I'm sure they'll show up.

117
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,630
What is it you do for a living, exactly?

118
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,130
- I develop real estate.  - It's a tough market.

119
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,630
Tell me about it.

120
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,460
But I'm confident that it'll turn around soon.

121
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,830
- And did Scarlett work with you?  - No, she was the artistic type.

122
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,330
She made jewelry. That was her thing.

123
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,300
Made a pretty good business out of it, in fact...

124
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,300
Selling to friends and neighbors.

125
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,360
Well, what kind of jewelry was it? Was it expensive stuff?

126
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,330
No. Just trinkets, really...

127
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,830
Earrings, bracelets...

128
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,000
Can we see some?

129
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,900
Sure.

130
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,700
Having fun?

131
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,930
Hmm.

132
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,430
That's very nice.

133
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,360
Was there any particular reason for the party last night?

134
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,160
Scarlett's idea.

135
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,560
She, um, thought it was necessary

136
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:31,160
To let people know we're doing fine.

137
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,160
And we are... Doing fine.

138
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,900
Did anybody at the party behave in an unusual manner?

139
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,060
- Any odd incidents?  - No.

140
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:42,630
- And you knew everybody at the party personally?  - Yes, good friends.

141
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,130
- Oh, we're gonna need a list.  - Sure.

142
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,500
From the country club, mostly.

143
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,100
Scarlett was elected chair of her women's committee there.

144
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,100
It's a big deal in this community,

145
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,230
Very prestigious.

146
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,330
I was so proud of her,

147
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,260
But it meant she had to spend a lot more time at...

148
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,760
- At the club.  - Argh!

149
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,360
- Argh!  - Oscar.

150
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:06,160
Stop. Please.

151
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,500
Pardon me.

152
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,630
- Um, are we done here?  - No, that's all for now.

153
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,930
We'll be in touch if we need anything else.

154
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,660
Very nice.

155
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,030
- What's your deal with Asra Hadami?   - Well, you saw the dinner theater way

156
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,160
In which she hugged Victor. She's deceiving him.

157
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,200
I thought it was a love affair gone awry, but it isn't.

158
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,700
It's something else. She's probably stealing from him.

159
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,700
I'll have Van Pelt pull her financials

160
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,200
At the same time she pulls the Marquesas'.

161
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,230
You know, we should go take a look at this country club.

162
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,100
Yeah, talk to the women's committee she chairs.

163
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,960
Bring Rigsby with you.

164
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:57,330
Someone here knows the truth.

165
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,360
Oh? And how so?

166
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,860
Well, poison and a message in lipstick

167
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,300
Says this murder was done by a woman.

168
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,800
And women have no secrets from other women.

169
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:10,860
- Well, unless it was a cunning man posing as a woman.  - What, you think?

170
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:14,260
No.

171
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,060
Semifinal pairs, players 23 and 45

172
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:26,200
To court one now, please. 23 and 45 to court one.

173
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,630
Good morning, ma'am. California bureau of investigation.

174
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,400
- I'm detective Rigsby. This is Jane.  - Hi, Heather.

175
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,060
Nice to meet you.

176
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:36,030
Everyone's been expecting you. Poor Scarlett. It's terrible.

177
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,630
- How can I help you?  - We'd like to start by talking

178
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,460
- To members of the women's committee.  - Sure thing.

179
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:45,530
- Uh, perhaps we'd, uh, gather them more discreetly?  - Oh, everyone will know in minutes, anyhow.

180
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,530
Jackie, Patience, Mandy,

181
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,230
The police are here, and they want to talk to us

182
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,760
about Scarlett's murder. Come to the rose courtyard.

183
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:55,260
And, everybody, the silent auction closes shortly,

184
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:58,460
so get those bids in now, folks.

185
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:01,900
- I'll show you the way.  - I love a silent auction.

186
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,700
So, uh, let's start with some names.

187
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,330
Uh, Patience Broadbent...

188
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,000
Mm-hmm.

189
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,930
- Mandy Riljek you've met.  - Hi.

190
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,330
- Jackie shaper.  - Thank god you're here.

191
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,660
You're gonna find this maniac, won't you?

192
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,700
We'll try. Uh, were you all at Scarlett's party?

193
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,330
- Yes.  - Yes, we all have to go to the chairwoman's parties.

194
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,460
- It's a rule.  - The chairwoman is a prestigious position, isn't it?

195
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:29,760
- Oh, yes, it is.  - She would make her fair share of enemies, I'd expect.

196
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:32,960
You could say that.

197
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:35,460
If you have something to say, say it.

198
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:38,100
- Speak your mind, bitch.  - Oh, okay. You want it all out there?

199
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,400
He asked about enemies, and that's what you were. 

200
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:45,130
She hated Scarlett because she wanted to be chair,

201
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,530
and Scarlett whipped her butt in the election.

202
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,960
- Schooled her, right, Mandy?  - Oh, I'm not getting into this one.

203
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:53,560
Right. I missed out on scoring the private office

204
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,700
with all that cool stationery with my name on it.

205
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,660
So I killed her. Have you any idea how idiotic you sound?

206
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:03,930
- You're the idiot.  - Tell you what. It's probably best

207
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,800
if we conduct interviews with each of you separately.

208
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:10,500
You're always so jealous of everybody. 

209
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,060
Do you remember

210
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,930
anything odd happening the night of the party?

211
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,430
I don't know.

212
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,430
It was just the usual mojitos and chitchat, but...

213
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,600
But what?

214
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,360
I don't know if I should tell you this,

215
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:26,000
but I saw Scarlett arguing with Asra Hadami.

216
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,760
It looked kind of angry. Some say something

217
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:31,330
more than business might be going on between Asra Hadami

218
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,700
and Victor Marquesa.

219
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,760
I don't know if that's true,

220
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:37,830
- and I don't really follow the gossip.  - Hmm. Who does?

221
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,800
We're told you're the gossip queen around here.

222
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,860
People tell me things.

223
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,500
So...

224
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,600
Who's having an affair with Victor Marquesa?

225
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,430
I don't know. Who? Tell.

226
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,000
Asra Hadami?

227
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,900
That's a funny idea?

228
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,930
No, it's just...

229
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,500
No. Victor and Asra are good friends, nothing more.

230
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,000
Asra had nothing to do with this.

231
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,460
No? What's the general opinion?

232
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,460
Who did this?

233
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:12,030
- My guess?  - Yeah.

234
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,230
Victor.

235
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,800
What makes you think that?

236
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,300
Nothing, really. I mean, Victor's a nice guy,

237
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,830
but that's who kills women, isn't it?

238
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,960
- Their husbands, 90% of the time.  - 70%, I think.

239
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,160
Hmm. 

240
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,630
He's right.

241
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,460
That was some great play. 

242
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:46,460
You could maybe do a little more topspin on your returns,

243
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:50,360
- but it was a very nice play.  - The answers are yes, I disliked her,

244
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,030
- no, I didn't kill her.  - You hate to lose, don't you?

245
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,000
Yes, unlike all those many people that love it.

246
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,660
I'm in the semifinals, for god sake.

247
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:02,860
Yeah. Oh, of course. Good luck with that.

248
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:06,030
Yeah, I have to go. I have another match in half an hour,

249
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,430
and that toxic dwarf, Mandy Riljek,

250
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,130
is trying to outbid me in the silent auction.

251
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,900
What she needs two romantic nights for at the Cliff side?

252
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,700
I don't know.

253
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,530
So I'll save us all some time

254
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,530
and tell you who did this, if you like.

255
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,030
I'd like that very much.

256
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,600
Asra Hadami.

257
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,500
Really? Why?

258
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,730
She's having an affair with Victor.

259
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,730
How do you know that?

260
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,600
I just have an eye for that stuff.

261
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,600
Asra must have killed Scarlett

262
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,860
so that she could have victor for herself.

263
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:38,700
Don't know why. If you ask me, he's a loser.

264
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,200
Well, thank you.

265
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,200
Oh, by the way, if you disliked Scarlett Marquesa so much,

266
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,800
why are you wearing earrings that she made?

267
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,930
She makes good earrings. It's nice to meet you.

268
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,800
Nice meeting you, too.

269
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,400
You two were close, weren't you?

270
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,000
We were very close.

271
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,930
Being her deputy in the women's committee,

272
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,230
- We spoke every day.  - Uh, did you notice anything, uh, different,

273
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:11,300
- About, uh, your conversations?  - She talked a lot about moving away.

274
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,260
- She was so tired of keeping up at all costs.  - At all costs?

275
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,930
- Just working so hard.  - Do you have a key for this?

276
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,500
Oh, no. Only Scarlett has a key.

277
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,260
This is the chairwoman's office,

278
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:24,330
and that's the chairwoman's safe.

279
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,800
That makes sense.

280
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,500
I don't know anything about that.

281
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,360
Scarlett's keys are missing. That's interesting.

282
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:37,360
- We need to get that safe open.  - We're gonna need a search warrant for that.

283
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:40,360
- I'm on it.  - Did you get anything from Scarlett's friends?

284
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,360
Well, everybody has a different theory.

285
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:45,000
They're all hiding something. I don't know what.

286
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,760
Did you hear anything from forensics about the lipstick on the napkin?

287
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:51,330
Not yet. They're jammed up, as usual. Budget cuts.

288
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,360
Boss, I just now got access to Asra Hadami's financials.

289
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:57,400
She cleared out her bank accounts this morning.

290
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,330
- Checking, savings... took out about $125,000 in cash.  - Going on the run maybe?

291
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,000
She didn't happen to buy any rat poison recently, did she?

292
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,500
That would be nice, but no. No record of it.

293
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,500
That was the Marsante security patrol calling.

294
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,500
They just found Hadami's house empty. She's gone.

295
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,660
- Great. A fugitive.  - Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! I... I know where she is.

296
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:26,360
CBI!

297
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,430
- Boss?  - Hmm?

298
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,460
I've been here nearly six months now, half a year.

299
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:42,460
What do you want? Half a cake?

300
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:45,030
I want to take lead on this interview.

301
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,500
Okay.

302
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,800
Okay?

303
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,530
Yeah. Sure.

304
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,460
Thanks, boss.

305
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,700
Why were you running, Miss Hadami?

306
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,160
No reason.

307
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,260
Stress. I needed space.

308
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:07,300
Nothing to do with the argument you had with Scarlett Marquesa

309
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,500
- The night she died?  - I didn't have an argument with her.

310
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,500
- We hear differently.  - No argument.

311
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,360
I swear, I didn't kill her. This is absurd.

312
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,900
No more absurd than you clearing out your accounts

313
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,400
And abandoning your home for no reason.

314
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,530
Maybe I need a lawyer.

315
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,630
Say the word.

316
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:30,360
What he'll tell you... if you're not involved in the murder...

317
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:33,560
Best speak up.

318
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:37,060
I ran because I knew the murder would expose some issues

319
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,800
That I would like to keep private.

320
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,900
Such as your relationship with Mandy Riljek?

321
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,530
Exactly. News like that could be ruinous.

322
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,430
True, but not the kind of thing you abandon your house for.

323
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,730
You said "issues." what are the other issues?

324
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,430
I didn't wanna have to look Victor in the face

325
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,060
And tell him I'd helped run

326
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:58,500
Everything he worked so hard for into the ground.

327
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:02,700
- How did you help do that?  - I borrowed money from the company's cash reserve.

328
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,400
How much?

329
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,000
A little over half a million.

330
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,660
And where did it go?

331
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,660
I made some poor investment choices

332
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:13,160
- That I had to cover quickly.  - So you stole...

333
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,530
I borrowed from the reserve.

334
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,730
I skimmed the money from each development deal

335
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,230
That should have gone

336
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,600
Into the company's reserve account as backup.

337
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,130
We were making so many deals.

338
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,930
I knew I'd get it back before it would matter.

339
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,930
But then the deals and the funding dried up,

340
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,630
And suddenly, that reserve became very important.

341
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:36,260
I sold anything I could get my hands on to cover the money.

342
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,800
Mm. Take a seat.

343
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,300
Why am I even here? I've done nothing wrong.

344
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,600
Be with you in just one moment.

345
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,230
Ah.

346
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,830
Please.

347
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:04,730
Well, you were found in a compromising position

348
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,130
With a murder suspect.

349
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,660
How did you know how to find us anyway?

350
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:12,060
- You been spying on me?  - Well, you outbid Patience for a romantic weekend,

351
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,900
And your husband Jim's away.

352
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,900
And you laughed at the idea of Victor and Asra as lovers.

353
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,160
Nobody knows I'm here, right?

354
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:21,960
If this gets out, it'll be a huge scandal.

355
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,160
Nobody knows you're here.

356
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,630
Sign this, and you're good to go.

357
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,100
Judge's clerk says we won't get a search warrant

358
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,360
for Scarlett's safe until tomorrow morning.

359
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,660
- Then we'll go in and tear the place apart.  - J... 

360
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:41,660
- Oh. Sorry.  - You didn't hear that. It's confidential.

361
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,830
- Confidential?  - Oh, of course.

362
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,160
No, seriously. Don't tell anyone, okay?

363
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,830
- I understand. May I leave now?  - Yeah, please.

364
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,530
Not bad. Your delivery was a bit wooden.

365
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,900
Wooden? Me?

366
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,300
Yeah, and you're Marlon Brando.

367
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,560
I can't believe it.

368
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,900
Asra's been with me for over five years.

369
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,030
I mean, she was with me in the trenches.

370
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,330
I can't believe this.

371
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,400
After going over your accounts, we had a couple of questions.

372
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,760
- Sure.  - You've talked about cash crises in your business,

373
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:23,130
but regular cash deposits were made to your personal accounts,

374
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,800
somewhere upwards of $5,000.

375
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,860
- Scarlett's deposits.  - Oscar, come get your lunch.

376
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,830
Those are some pretty hefty deposits

377
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,830
for somebody not really working. Where'd the money come from?

378
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,160
Uh, her jewelry business.

379
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:38,030
I thought you said it was a small side business.

380
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,030
Well, it was, but recently her pieces were

381
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,200
getting a lot of interest, and apparently, uh,

382
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,230
- she made a deal with a couple of boutiques.  - Do you know which ones?

383
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:49,660
- I never asked.  - Without her money, you would have fallen behind months ago.

384
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:51,660
I know all too well.

385
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:54,600
It was my wife who had to save our butts recently.

386
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,200
- Dad?  - What's the matter?

387
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,530
You made it wrong.

388
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,530
Mommy never puts all this stuff in it.

389
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,560
She knows I like it plain.

390
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:06,230
Can we make a compromise, buddy?

391
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,560
I... I need to talk to these nice police ladies.

392
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:11,100
Now I'll make it better next time. I promise.

393
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,760
Now would you please just eat the sandwich?

394
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,190
Sorry about that.

395
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,690
It's not a problem.

396
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,690
According to your wife's phone records,

397
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,790
she traded a lot of calls with several disposable cell phones.

398
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,790
- Well, I don't know who she would have been talking to.  - In her day planner,

399
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,960
She had a regular weekly date noted down

400
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,960
with an address in Marysville.

401
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,260
She had one scheduled for later today.

402
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,260
- Do you know anything about that?  - No, I don't know what that's about,

403
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,260
But I know she used to go to Marysville a lot

404
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,260
for the antique jewelry markets and stuff. 

405
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,520
Excuse me.

406
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,260
Lisbon.

407
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,820
Results on the lipstick.

408
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,820
No traces of D.N.A. Were found,

409
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,820
but the color, "tongue in cheek,"

410
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:52,560
is a limited edition, sold only in a few high-end stores.

411
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,220
Tongue in cheek... that's cute.

412
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:56,960
Look, secure access to each of the stores receipt records

413
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,960
So we can search through them.

414
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,120
Then I want you to meet us at

415
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:03,790
65434 East Boulevard.

416
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,760
It's in Marysville. On my way.

417
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,490
I'll, uh, I'll catch up to you.

418
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:20,820
- Hi.  - Hey.

419
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:23,590
- Who's winning?  - Oh, I don't know.

420
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:26,590
- I don't follow the play, to be honest.  - Yeah, it's kind of silly, isn't it?

421
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:29,660
Everybody's so serious over a game.

422
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,160
Exactly. Like it matters who wins a stupid trophy.

423
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,820
I guess people feel they need a purpose.

424
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:38,290
Yeah, well, my purpose died this year at the age of 16.

425
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,020
Oh. I'm sorry. Boy or girl?

426
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:43,760
Girl. High as a kite with one of her friends.

427
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,420
She wrapped her car around a tree.

428
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:50,190
- Friend got away without a scratch, thank god.  - What was her name?

429
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:53,760
Rachel. Once you lose a child,

430
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,590
all this striving seems kinda ridiculous, you know?

431
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:59,020
Yeah. Unfortunately, I do.

432
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,860
Why not leave it all behind? Just go away?

433
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,520
I can't afford to leave.

434
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:09,360
I have negative equity on my house.

435
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:12,190
Oh, nice play, Karen!

436
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,590
Besides, these are my friends.

437
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,590
This is all I have.

438
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:35,220
According to Scarlett's planner, the meeting's here.

439
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,390
Let's see if we can spot the contact.

440
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,660
I don't know. Maybe we'll get lucky.

441
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:56,520
Hi, guys. What are you doing?

442
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:01,190
Aah! 

443
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,560
Get up. 

444
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,120
- This way.  - All right, all right, all right.

445
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,560
I should have brought some snacks.

446
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:27,820
- I don't see this working in a hurry.  - Ah, you shouldn't go hungry long.

447
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:30,820
Mandy's news will have spread quickly.

448
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:32,690
Everyone knows

449
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:36,090
that tomorrow, the safe will be opened.

450
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,260
It's now or never for whoever took Scarlett's keys.

451
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,290
Hey, easy there.

452
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,290
That is antique Mexican silver.

453
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,290
Maybe next time you'll think

454
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,290
before trying to outrun an officer of the law.

455
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,820
I'm assuming this isn't candy.

456
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:58,960
Why were you meeting Scarlett Marquesa?

457
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,090
So we could exchange beauty secrets.

458
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,760
- You mind if I smoke?  - Yeah, I do.

459
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,090
- Oh.  - Van Pelt, what do you got?

460
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,590
Wardell Suggs, A.K.A. "Digger."

461
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,960
He's been arrested for several counts of petty theft,

462
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,990
- fraud and assault.  - That's very impressive.

463
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:17,290
- It could be better.  - Why were you meeting Scarlett?

464
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,490
What'd she tell you about me?

465
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,060
Nothing. She's dead.

466
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,120
I... I didn't have anything to do with that. 

467
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,760
Hey, boss, come take a look.

468
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:32,420
Would you look at that? The mother lode.

469
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,560
Let's talk, huh?

470
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,560
The hell, I got a strike to give.

471
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,590
Scarlett was one of my biggest customers.

472
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:41,090
Painkillers, tranquilizers, diet pills...

473
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,660
by the hundreds.

474
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,660
Scarlett was dealing prescription drugs?

475
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,960
Yep.

476
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,090
- Where did you two meet?  - Swap meet.

477
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,290
She was trying to sell that god-awful jewelry.

478
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,290
She looked desperate, so I told her

479
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,120
- there's easier ways to make money.  - Were you doing a deal tonight?

480
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:01,120
Supposed to. Lately, I've been having to listen

481
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:03,760
to her yammer about quitting. Then she'd buy some bag,

482
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:06,020
saying this is the last time she's doing it.

483
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:08,920
- Of course she'd always come back.  - She was gonna quit?

484
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,160
Yep.

485
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,520
A matter of fact, last couple of weeks,

486
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:15,190
I've been getting calls from another girl,

487
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,160
saying Scarlett gave her my info.

488
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,190
Same prissy kind of voice.

489
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,560
Chick said she'd be interested in setting up her own situation

490
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,960
- when Scarlett quit.  - Does this chick have a name?

491
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,990
You know, I'm not big on names at first,

492
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,920
but I do have her number.

493
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,520
Why don't you give her a call?

494
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,260
Oh.

495
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,490
Digger, why are you calling me now?

496
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,490
In your own time Ma'am, if you would like to take a seat.

497
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,900
Thank you so much.

498
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:24,990
How did you come to have Scarlett Marquesa's keys?

499
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,790
I took them when I went to offer my condolences to Victor.

500
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,120
Naughty I know, but I couldn't wait.

501
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:33,660
It's not naughty. It's a felony.

502
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,690
You wanted to get your hands on her pill supply.

503
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:40,160
Nonsense. I opened that safe out of idle curiosity.

504
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,960
I had no idea there were any pills in there.

505
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:46,990
I simply wanted to measure the windows for new drapes.

506
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:50,090
- I'll be the next chair of the committee.  - Oh. Then why not wait till it's official?

507
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,620
Am I here because of keys?

508
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:55,620
Explain the nature of your relationship with Wardell Suggs.

509
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:57,190
Who?

510
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,860
Digger?

511
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,960
I liked his jewelry.

512
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,460
Okay. Were you aware that Scarlett Marquesa was selling

513
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,490
illegal prescription drugs in the Villa Marsante Estates?

514
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,990
Who didn't know?

515
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:14,560
Well, except for you all.

516
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:17,320
If everyone knew, then why didn't anyone come forth?

517
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:18,820
And risked being ostracized

518
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:21,690
or caught up in the vulgarity of it all?

519
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,190
Not likely.

520
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,190
She was doing a booming business,

521
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,360
and you wanted to be part of it,

522
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,790
- maybe a little too much.  - So I killed her? Please.

523
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,790
Hello. She was a drug dealer.

524
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,490
The people she dealt with must have done her in...

525
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,090
other dealers.

526
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,590
Or a highly capable rival

527
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:40,160
straight in the middle of her own community?

528
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:44,660
You have found no drugs or poison on me or in my home.

529
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,720
The keys were taken after she was killed,

530
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:50,320
and I only opened that safe out of idle curiosity.

531
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:52,320
You taped together your whole theory

532
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:54,320
with a couple of random conversations

533
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:57,160
I've had with a drug dealer. Does that about sum it up?

534
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:00,520
Well, when she puts it like that, it does seem pretty thin.

535
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:04,320
- Yeah. She's a piece of work, isn't she?  - Yeah.

536
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:07,720
We're gonna have to cut her loose for now, but I think

537
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:10,360
Some discreet surveillance might help our cause.

538
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:14,190
If you were thinking of trying that on, don't.

539
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:17,190
- Not your shade.  - What do you think about older women?

540
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:20,190
Where is this coming from? I don't think about older women.

541
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:23,620
- My mother's an older woman.  - Not old old, just older, you know?

542
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:26,120
- Older than you.  - Why you asking?

543
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:28,590
You're not trying to set me up with somebody, are you?

544
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,090
It turns out... if you look

545
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,090
At the available scientific evidence on the internet...

546
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,990
And they've got less hang-ups,

547
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:35,590
They like themselves way more than younger women,

548
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,590
And they're at their sexual peak.

549
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,690
I mean, that's what the research says anyhow.

550
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,290
What the hell happened to you at that country club?

551
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:47,220
Nothing. I'm just saying that... umm, she spotted us.

552
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,420
Afternoon, boys.

553
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:54,420
I was making myself a panini.

554
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:57,420
- And thought I'd bring you some, too.  - Oh. Thanks, ma'am.

555
00:29:57,490 --> 00:29:59,420
Oh, and just so you know,

556
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:02,320
I am headed to the club for a massage,

557
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:04,320
So you don't need to follow too close.

558
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:07,660
- Relax. Have a bite to eat first. I'll see you there.  - Yes, ma'am. 

559
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,520
"yes, ma'am, thank you, ma'am." what is wrong with you?

560
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:15,360
Well, she surprised me.

561
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:19,160
- What's in the sandwiches?  - Well, it's a panini, if you don't mind.

562
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,160
It's, uh, ham and cheese. 

563
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,920
Yeah, who knows what else?

564
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:33,120
My God. Drugs?

565
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:35,990
I can't believe it.

566
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,990
Using jewelry sales as a cover,

567
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:40,120
Your wife was dealing prescription drugs...

568
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:43,490
Painkillers mostly. Speed, diet pills.

569
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,820
Some of them were coming in from mexico,

570
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:49,120
Other ones were stolen from pharmacies.

571
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:51,120
You seem genuinely surprised.

572
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:53,520
A lot of people around here knew about her.

573
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:55,890
I had no idea.

574
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,890
You don't think I had something to do with this?

575
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,990
She was moving an awful lot of inventory.

576
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,790
I had nothing to do with this.

577
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,790
How could you have not known

578
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:08,720
She was medicating half the women in the neighborhood?

579
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,690
She lied to me.

580
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,890
Maybe she was just trying to protect me from the shame.

581
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,890
Or maybe it was easier just to turn a blind eye,

582
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,720
As long as the money was coming in.

583
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:21,960
No.

584
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,390
If I had known she was doing this,

585
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,660
I would have tried to stop her.

586
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,190
Hi. I'm patrick.

587
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,390
Oscar.

588
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,590
You want to talk, oscar?

589
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,620
Pretty heavy stuff going on, right?

590
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:53,020
Yeah.

591
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,720
I'm sorry about your mom.

592
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:59,160
Me, too.

593
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:03,620
My dad is sad because you guys can't find who did it.

594
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:05,920
But I don't mind about that.

595
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:08,390
I just want her back.

596
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,360
She can't come back. You know that, don't you?

597
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,260
I know that.

598
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,990
I'm 9.

599
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:20,190
I will never see her again until I'm dead, too.

600
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:23,090
Then I'll go stay with her in heaven.

601
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,590
Well, that sounds good.

602
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:28,590
But you know what I noticed you're really good at

603
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,620
That could help you right now?

604
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:32,260
What?

605
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,090
Make-believe.

606
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,090
Yeah.

607
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,320
I am.

608
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:39,420
You are very good at it.

609
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:41,760
A master like you, you wanted to talk to your mom,

610
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:44,990
You could make-believe she was here and do whatever you like.

611
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
- I do it all the time.  - You talk to my mom?

612
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,760
No, not your mom. I talk to my wife.

613
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,660
- She's dead?  - Yeah. Yeah.

614
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,620
But I talk to her all the time. You should try it.

615
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:56,760
- It's very good.  - I guess.

616
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,790
Well, whatever.

617
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:01,960
This is cool.

618
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:04,160
You any good with this sword?

619
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:07,160
I'm okay. 

620
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,460
Oh, really?

621
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,460
En garde.

622
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,590
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! I got you! 

623
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,060
Ahh!

624
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,390
Please. Mercy.

625
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,760
Mercy.

626
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,620
Fair maiden.

627
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:26,360
D'artagnan, I have to go. Good-bye.

628
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,990
Ugh, Spa stuff takes forever.

629
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,990
How long can a massage be?

630
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:40,990
No, they do all sorts of things to you besides a massage...

631
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,190
- facials, waxing, mud.  - How do you know so much?

632
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,390
I bought a certificate for my mom.

633
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,060
Wayne.

634
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,060
You're back again. How nice.

635
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,020
Hi, Mrs. Shaper.

636
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:55,320
Now you know, you must call me Jackie.

637
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:58,720
And it's "ms.", not "mrs". Divorced.

638
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:01,120
Sorry... Jackie.

639
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:04,290
He was a good man, but weak, essentially.

640
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,290
- He just couldn't see...  - Wait. What are you wearing on your lips?

641
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,220
- Excuse me?  - The color. What... what color is this?

642
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:13,720
- Tongue in cheek. You like it?  - Where did you get it?

643
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:17,090
- I bought it at the boutique in town.  - How long have you been wearing this shade?

644
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,590
I just bought it today.

645
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:21,090
I saw it on Patience Broadbent at Scarlett's party.

646
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,090
I just had to have it. It's a crazy price,

647
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,860
- But what the heck?  - You're positive that it's tongue in cheek?

648
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:29,160
- I have it right here.  - And you definitely saw Patience wearing it first

649
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:32,020
- at Scarlett Marquesa's party?  - Is that a pickup line?

650
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:35,260
Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!

651
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,720
Aah! Aah!

652
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,990
No detecectable prints on the knife.

653
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,320
Surveillance tapes? The Spa didn't believe in them.

654
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:07,790
Something to do with disturbing the chi.

655
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:11,190
I don't get it. Why kill patience? Why now?

656
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:14,020
Perhaps it was part of the plan all along.

657
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:16,490
No, this was hasty. Patience became the new target.

658
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,060
Revenge for Scarlett's death? Victor was quick to anger.

659
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,090
Rigsby, find out

660
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,190
- Victor Marquesa's recent whereabouts.  - Yes, boss.

661
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:26,190
It could have been someone else.

662
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,920
The competition wiping out the dealer

663
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:32,820
- and her heir apparent or...  - Or what?

664
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:35,920
Victor does fit nicely, doesn't he?

665
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:37,360
Yeah.

666
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,290
- Can you believe that patience got stabbed?  - Here we are.

667
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,990
It's like a mafia hit.

668
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,990
I'm never going in that Spa again, I will tell you that.

669
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,990
Tragic set of events.

670
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:55,120
I didn't see it coming.

671
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:58,120
So what do you think? This is some kind of drug war?

672
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:01,890
Could be, but stabbings are usually crimes of passion.

673
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,460
This is, uh, this is very personal.

674
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,890
Mm. Mm. So what's next?

675
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,990
CBI are already putting the pieces together.

676
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,590
In fact, uh...

677
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,890
W... never mind.

678
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:14,920
What?

679
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:17,290
No, I... I... I shouldn't talk about it.

680
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:20,860
- Cause it's still an ongoing case.  - You know, you can't just leave something like that hanging.

681
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,860
Well, I'm sorry, you know,

682
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,860
But I will get myself in a lot of trouble.

683
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,120
Oh, come on, girls.

684
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:30,560
All right, listen. Can you promise me

685
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,960
That this will just stay between us?

686
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:33,920
Yes. Yes, of course.

687
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:35,460
- You promise?  - I promise.

688
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,660
- Okay, we're going after Victor Marquesa.  - Victor?

689
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,920
Oh, I don't believe it. He doesn't even look like the type.

690
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:44,520
- On what grounds?  - We think that he killed Patience

691
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:47,560
- out of revenge for the murder of his wife.  - But you said there was no proof Patience was guilty.

692
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:50,690
I guess victor didn't want to wait around for proof.

693
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,890
- What's gonna happen to Oscar?  - Mother murdered, now dad's a murderer.

694
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,890
Once they arrest the father, he'll be placed in foster care.

695
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,760
- Oh, how dreadful.  - Mm.

696
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:01,690
- That poor child.  - It is.

697
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,790
Mm.

698
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:14,820
I guess they couldn't keep the secret.

699
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:16,520
Guess they can't.

700
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:20,760
Let's do it.

701
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,220
- It's gonna be all right, son.  - Dad!

702
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:25,060
- I promise.  - No!

703
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,990
- It's gonna be okay.  - Where are you going?

704
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:30,890
- Don't worry!  - I'll be right back! No! Dad!

705
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,190
Come back! No!

706
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:37,260
No, no, no. Wait. Wait. No.

707
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:41,490
- Stop, stop, stop. You have to stop this.  - No. No, Heather. No, we can't.

708
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,060
- Dad! Dad!  - This is justice being served.

709
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,890
- How can you say that? Look what you're putting that boy through.  - He'll forget eventually. It's fine.

710
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,890
- No. No, he won't.  - It's fine.

711
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,760
- No. No, it's not.  - Why?

712
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:52,390
Because I did it!  I killed them.

713
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,090
I killed them both.

714
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,820
Oh, God.

715
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,620
Okay.

716
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,160
I first suspected it was you because it seemed...

717
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:14,790
... that everybody else at the club wore some of Scarlett's jewelry,

718
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,960
... but not you.

719
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,690
That's it?

720
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,060
Jewelry?

721
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,560
The more we talked,

722
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:25,990
... the more I felt your pain and anger.

723
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:28,990
Losing your daughter has unhinged you.

724
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:31,860
Unhinged?

725
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,760
Yeah, I suppose it has.

726
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:40,460
My daughter...

727
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:44,920
Rachel.

728
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:48,120
She loved to dance.

729
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:50,490
Didn't matter what kind of music either,

730
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,260
... a toe would start tapping and...

731
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,220
... she was just so full of life.

732
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:02,120
She had taken several painkillers with alcohol...

733
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:05,090
... before she got behind the wheel.

734
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:08,090
One of her neighborhood friends got them from her mother...

735
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,090
... who got them from Scarlett.

736
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,620
I understand your anger.

737
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:16,260
It was like they ripped my soul out clean.

738
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,060
But the rest of the world just kept moving right along.

739
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:24,620
It was like I was the only one who remembered what happened.

740
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:27,190
So when I...

741
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:30,290
... saw her flitting about town,

742
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:33,360
... selling her pills without a care in the world,

743
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:36,520
... still hosting parties at her house,

744
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:38,490
Happily dancing around...

745
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,820
... without a stitch of the misery I was carrying, I snapped.

746
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,260
I killed her.

747
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:56,320
I didn't want any other person...

748
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:59,060
... to have to experience what I did.

749
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:17,360
And Patience?

750
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:20,590
She told everyone at the club not to worry.

751
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,590
She was gonna take over Scarlett's business...

752
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,660
... and keep the pills coming,

753
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,620
... like nothing had happened,

754
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:30,160
Like no lessons had been learned.

755
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:34,190
I had to finish what I started.

756
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:37,390
I had to.

757
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:44,890
I'll get this transcribed for you to sign.

758
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,860
Now that it's done, does it feel better?

759
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:02,420
It doesn't change a thing.

760
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,790
Agent Lisbon.

761
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:15,190
Mr. Marquesa, hi.

762
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:18,090
I want to thank you and your team.

763
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,290
Although, I must admit, that whole scene...

764
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,390
- ... in front of the house...  - It was make-believe, dad.

765
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:26,460
Sorry. The make-believe was a bit unorthodox...

766
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,560
... and unpleasant.

767
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:31,390
- But I'm sure you all know what you're doing.  - Most of the time.

768
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:34,890
I want to apologize if we were tough on you.

769
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,820
No, it's what I needed to hear.

770
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:40,620
We're moving out of villa Marsante...

771
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:43,460
... and headed back to my hometown.

772
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,960
My son and I have a lot of catching up to do.

773
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:50,090
Take care.

774
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,760
Thanks.

775
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:55,790
Mr. Jane.

776
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:58,090
Thank you.

777
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,220
Oh, it's nothing. Forget about it.

778
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:01,960
Take care.

779
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,990
Good luck. Bye.

780
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:09,490
Another minute, and I would have missed them.

781
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,160
- I do hate it when people say thank you.  - Why?

782
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:14,620
He likes to play the lone ranger.

783
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:16,520
"Who was that masked man?"

784
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:18,790
"I never got a chance to thank him."

785
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:22,090
Exactly.

786
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,620
Uh, I don't want to alarm you,

787
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:29,090
... but your friend Jackie has just walked in behind you,

788
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,160
... and she is looking fierce.

789
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:34,920
Oh, I know. I asked her out to dinner.

790
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:38,260
Hey.

791
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


792
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
