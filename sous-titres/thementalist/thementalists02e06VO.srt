1
00:00:01,903 --> 00:00:05,418
We got Kirby Hines,
29-year-old local boy, welder.

2
00:00:05,883 --> 00:00:07,423
That's pretty much all we got.

3
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:09,738
Local P. D. has stomped
all over the crime scene,

4
00:00:09,863 --> 00:00:11,285
forensics won't be any use.

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:14,472
It's like they don't even watch TV.
Every toddler knows this stuff.

6
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:18,082
- Lisbon. How you doing?
- Pat. Long time.

7
00:00:18,207 --> 00:00:19,253
What's the deal?

8
00:00:19,378 --> 00:00:21,479
T.O.D. looks to be
yesterday afternoon,

9
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:22,675
give or take.

10
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:25,858
Your standard blunt-force trauma
to the back of the head...

11
00:00:26,246 --> 00:00:28,861
Maybe one strike followed by a couple
of real widow makers.

12
00:00:29,264 --> 00:00:32,546
- Length of wood, I'm guessing.
- What's on his face, is that glighter?

13
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,280
Riding that disco farm boy tip.

14
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:40,714
His family's here.

15
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,550
Gonna get ugly, I expect.

16
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:45,795
I'll see you later.

17
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,856
Rigsby, Van Pelt, work the body.

18
00:01:05,382 --> 00:01:06,482
Interesting.

19
00:01:08,198 --> 00:01:09,934
I feel like Jane knows about us.

20
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,113
No, he doesn't.
How would he know?

21
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:13,872
I know we've been cool.

22
00:01:14,737 --> 00:01:17,118
- It feels like he knows.
- You're being paranoid.

23
00:01:17,424 --> 00:01:20,329
Just because I'm being paranoid
doesn't mean that Jane doesn't know.

24
00:01:22,003 --> 00:01:24,792
- Tell me you didn't kill him.
- I got nothing against him

25
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:26,477
That poor boy is lying there.

26
00:01:26,602 --> 00:01:28,587
He's just fool enough
to marry your daughter.

27
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,214
You're going down, you're dead!

28
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:31,841
Bring it right ahead!

29
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,043
That's enough.

30
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,848
You step out of my room.
Here I am!

31
00:01:35,973 --> 00:01:37,888
Back off!
We're grieving, you clown!

32
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,265
Why don't you back up?

33
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:41,509
You make me, pissant.

34
00:01:44,115 --> 00:01:45,415
How's that feel?

35
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,106
Nicely done.

36
00:01:47,498 --> 00:01:49,548
You're under arrest.
Let's go.

37
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:58,156
Sir, let me get this straight.

38
00:01:58,281 --> 00:02:00,563
The victim's wife is Donna Hines,

39
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:02,316
and it was her brother Rod Gerber

40
00:02:02,441 --> 00:02:04,373
that told you to step back.
Is that right?

41
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,367
My name is Theodore Luscom.

42
00:02:06,492 --> 00:02:08,810
I am a citizen of free California.

43
00:02:09,267 --> 00:02:12,378
The so-called federal
and state authorities you work for

44
00:02:12,503 --> 00:02:16,053
are not legitimate.
Therefore, I do not recognize your right

45
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:17,928
to arrest or question me.

46
00:02:18,946 --> 00:02:20,806
- Please!
- You don't know it,

47
00:02:20,931 --> 00:02:23,688
but you people are just tools
of the United Nations.

48
00:02:23,962 --> 00:02:26,876
We know it.
They told us last June, laid it all out.

49
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:27,943
Say what?

50
00:02:28,068 --> 00:02:30,409
There's a change of policy.
Had a big secretive meeting,

51
00:02:30,534 --> 00:02:34,047
told us exactly who we're working for.
That, my friend, was an eye-opener.

52
00:02:34,172 --> 00:02:35,139
I tell you.

53
00:02:35,264 --> 00:02:37,031
- Are you mocking me?
- I'm serious.

54
00:02:37,715 --> 00:02:39,536
They told us the whole grand plan.

55
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:40,661
Hush.

56
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:42,686
Ignore him, Mr. Luscom.

57
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,296
Good stuff.

58
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,162
Just ignore me.

59
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,179
- Lisbon?
- Hey, what's up?

60
00:02:57,304 --> 00:02:59,966
You're not gonna like this,
but you're gonna have to deal with it.

61
00:03:00,091 --> 00:03:01,390
- What?
- Bosco.

62
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:03,515
Hi Jane!
You're under arrest.

63
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,184
What the hell?

64
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,728
What are you doing?

65
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:09,063
Poke him up.

66
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:14,026
2x06
"Black Gold And Red Blood"

67
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:18,322


68
00:03:18,901 --> 00:03:20,341
It's a microphone transmitter

69
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:23,202
located during an electronic sweep
of our offices.

70
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,920
That is a dedicated
receiver to the unit

71
00:03:26,144 --> 00:03:27,581
which I found in Jane's desk.

72
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:30,876
Is this true, Jane?
You're spying on Bosco and his team.

73
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,836
"Spying" is such an ugly word.

74
00:03:34,933 --> 00:03:37,049
More just keeping
a friendly eye on things.

75
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,976
- Did you knew?
- Of course not.

76
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:41,345
- I would have never allowed this.
- She would never.

77
00:03:41,718 --> 00:03:44,021
You understand
this is a serious criminal offense?

78
00:03:44,146 --> 00:03:45,099
Come on.

79
00:03:45,512 --> 00:03:47,101
Eavesdropping is a felony

80
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,338
under section 632 of the penal code,

81
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:51,471
punishable by up to
one year in prison.

82
00:03:51,672 --> 00:03:53,107
How could you be so stupid?

83
00:03:55,877 --> 00:03:59,086
He has the Red John case.
He won't keep me informed...

84
00:03:59,211 --> 00:04:01,031
I have to keep myself informed.

85
00:04:01,501 --> 00:04:02,860
I was low-key about it.

86
00:04:02,985 --> 00:04:04,587
I could have turned on his agents

87
00:04:04,712 --> 00:04:06,362
or used blackmail or...

88
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:07,955
bribery, I didn't.

89
00:04:08,387 --> 00:04:10,255
Thanks for your restraint.

90
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,960
We can resolve this easily.
It's your choice.

91
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:14,178
How's that?

92
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,299
If Jane resigns immediately

93
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:21,135
and agrees
to never return to the CBI,

94
00:04:22,364 --> 00:04:24,471
I will ask the A.G.
not to file charges.

95
00:04:25,249 --> 00:04:26,056
Boss.

96
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:28,663
You know Bosco has the right of it.
Nothing I can do.

97
00:04:28,997 --> 00:04:31,729
Nothing I want to do, frankly.
He crossed a line.

98
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,565
What's it gonna be?

99
00:04:37,663 --> 00:04:38,707
Charge me.

100
00:04:39,745 --> 00:04:41,345
I'll see you in court.

101
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,283
I'm not gonna leave the CBI
just 'cause you tell me to.

102
00:04:44,592 --> 00:04:46,707
If I charge you, you'll go to jail

103
00:04:46,832 --> 00:04:48,033
now, today.

104
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,397
And you can't apply
for bail till Tuesday.

105
00:04:50,522 --> 00:04:52,249
so that's 3 days and nights in jail.

106
00:04:52,679 --> 00:04:54,624
That's a new experience.
I welcome it.

107
00:04:54,749 --> 00:04:56,503
Don't be stupid. This is serious.

108
00:04:57,209 --> 00:04:59,006
Come on, Sam.
You really wanna do this?

109
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:00,925
I just did.
Malloy!

110
00:05:01,878 --> 00:05:03,228
He's ready to go.

111
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,360
Open two.

112
00:05:32,354 --> 00:05:33,354
Hey guys.

113
00:05:35,348 --> 00:05:37,670
Hey Pete. You see any vermin
out in the corridor there?

114
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,863
- Vermin?
- Mice.

115
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,942
See? Told you.
You're paranoid, man.

116
00:05:44,156 --> 00:05:45,556
I know what I saw.

117
00:05:46,337 --> 00:05:47,569
I know what I saw.

118
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,265
The arresting officer
advises protective custody.

119
00:05:50,998 --> 00:05:52,559
Are you a cop or a child rapist?

120
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,333
Neither.

121
00:05:54,505 --> 00:05:56,522
What do you need
protective custody for, then?

122
00:05:58,614 --> 00:06:00,314
I guess I don't need it.

123
00:06:01,275 --> 00:06:02,277
Your funeral.

124
00:06:29,321 --> 00:06:31,339
They're just playing with you.

125
00:06:34,153 --> 00:06:35,153
Stop.

126
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:37,809
Open up number eight.

127
00:06:59,151 --> 00:07:00,611
Hi. Nice to meet you.

128
00:07:03,232 --> 00:07:04,532
What you in for?

129
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:05,943
Me?

130
00:07:06,486 --> 00:07:08,837
Eavesdropping on a state agent.

131
00:07:10,793 --> 00:07:11,430
You?

132
00:07:12,783 --> 00:07:16,393
They say I raped and murdered a guy,
stabbed him to death.

133
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:20,103
- But it's not true.
- That's good.

134
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,137
We had consensual sex,

135
00:07:22,382 --> 00:07:24,282
then I stabbed him to death.

136
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:27,795
You get the top bunk.

137
00:07:30,827 --> 00:07:32,327
I like the top bunk.

138
00:07:35,031 --> 00:07:36,666
I know. It's sad and it's stupid,

139
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,730
but Jane was bound
to self-destruct eventually.

140
00:07:38,855 --> 00:07:40,215
- We all knew that.
- Boss...

141
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,256
Let's get back to the case,
shall we?

142
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,674
Is that the book
we found on the victim?

143
00:07:45,526 --> 00:07:47,411
Kirby wouldn't win
any penmanship awards.

144
00:07:47,536 --> 00:07:50,469
- It's mostly illegible.
- Lots of numbers. Times, maybe?

145
00:07:51,151 --> 00:07:54,515
- Map coordinates. Bible citations.
- There's a few names I can make out

146
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,060
Jay,

147
00:07:56,266 --> 00:07:57,267
Martin.

148
00:07:57,687 --> 00:07:58,977
And then on this page...

149
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,188
"Vultures"?

150
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,440
Somebody's preying on him,
waiting for him to die?

151
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,275
Preying on him for what, though?

152
00:08:05,457 --> 00:08:07,569
- He wasn't rich.
- Get to work on Ted Luscom.

153
00:08:07,831 --> 00:08:10,447
Van Pelt and I are gonna go talk
to Kirby's family.

154
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,367
- Rigsby, get on the Hineses.
- OK, you got it.

155
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:23,752
So, Ted, tell us about your beef
with Kirby Hines and the Gerbers.

156
00:08:24,928 --> 00:08:26,964
I get to call you by
your first name, too?

157
00:08:27,694 --> 00:08:28,841
Okay. I'm Kimball.

158
00:08:29,237 --> 00:08:31,135
Ain't you smooth and easygoing.

159
00:08:36,592 --> 00:08:38,787
That 10 acres where Kirby died...

160
00:08:40,094 --> 00:08:42,497
that was my grandfather's land.

161
00:08:43,863 --> 00:08:46,995
20 years back, my father's
brother Roy stole it

162
00:08:47,422 --> 00:08:49,122
From us rightful progeny

163
00:08:49,247 --> 00:08:51,071
And fraudulently sold it
to the Gerbers,

164
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:52,698
who knew.

165
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,871
The Gerbers knew he stole it.

166
00:08:54,996 --> 00:08:57,077
How much is 10 acres of land
worth around there?

167
00:08:57,872 --> 00:09:00,598
Hell man, it ain't the land.
It's what's under it...

168
00:09:00,723 --> 00:09:01,723
oil sands.

169
00:09:02,523 --> 00:09:04,769
It used to be worthless.
Cost too much to pump out.

170
00:09:04,894 --> 00:09:06,733
But with the price of oil sky-high,

171
00:09:06,858 --> 00:09:08,758
oil sands are worth workin'.

172
00:09:10,025 --> 00:09:11,611
We're talking 50,

173
00:09:12,028 --> 00:09:14,303
$60 million to the landowners.

174
00:09:14,602 --> 00:09:16,752
So you took the Gerbers to court.

175
00:09:19,037 --> 00:09:20,037
Last year.

176
00:09:20,701 --> 00:09:22,477
And what do you think happened?

177
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:23,692
You got nothing.

178
00:09:23,817 --> 00:09:24,886
Zero.

179
00:09:26,258 --> 00:09:28,758
I knew
I shouldn't have wasted my time,

180
00:09:28,883 --> 00:09:32,154
but the deceit and dishonesty
has made me mad.

181
00:09:33,015 --> 00:09:34,281
Where were you yesterday?

182
00:09:36,937 --> 00:09:38,702
I was several places, Kimball.

183
00:09:39,115 --> 00:09:40,704
- We're gonna need a list.
- We?

184
00:09:41,992 --> 00:09:43,207
I only see one of you.

185
00:09:43,623 --> 00:09:46,168
I and the state machinery oppression's
gonna need a list.

186
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,783
I'll think it over.

187
00:09:51,981 --> 00:09:54,169
Some people just don't have
that facility.

188
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:58,026
I'm sure your father loved you
in his way, he just didn't have the...

189
00:09:58,151 --> 00:10:00,412
tools to express that love.

190
00:10:02,491 --> 00:10:05,836
You know what, man? I really appreciate
you listening to me.

191
00:10:06,122 --> 00:10:07,222
Please, Boo.

192
00:10:07,729 --> 00:10:09,379
What are cellmates for?

193
00:10:27,407 --> 00:10:28,407
So listen.

194
00:10:28,803 --> 00:10:29,803
Listening.

195
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,010
About the...

196
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,270
unfortunate situation with Jane,

197
00:10:37,893 --> 00:10:39,137
I want you to know

198
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:41,647
that my beef is only with him.

199
00:10:42,852 --> 00:10:44,559
No problem with you or your people.

200
00:10:47,328 --> 00:10:50,232
It was a big mistake bringing
in a whack job like him, but...

201
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,151
that's in the past now.

202
00:10:55,259 --> 00:10:56,409
You and me...

203
00:10:58,385 --> 00:11:00,969
you and me always had
a good working relationship,

204
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:03,044
and I hope that can continue.

205
00:11:05,671 --> 00:11:06,581
I listened.

206
00:11:08,493 --> 00:11:09,543
So we're cool?

207
00:11:10,946 --> 00:11:13,196
You did what you thought was right.

208
00:11:13,764 --> 00:11:16,967
I need to think about it
before I know whether we're cool.

209
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,091
OK, fair enough.

210
00:11:31,951 --> 00:11:33,301
Good night, Jane.

211
00:11:36,614 --> 00:11:37,696
Good night, pal.

212
00:11:38,162 --> 00:11:40,407
And don't worry
about tomorrow morning.

213
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:44,828
Why would I need to worry
about this?

214
00:11:45,546 --> 00:11:48,874
There are some scary people here.
They all know you're a cop.

215
00:11:49,316 --> 00:11:52,216
How would they know that?
I'm not really a cop.

216
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,648
Then you'll be fine.

217
00:11:57,772 --> 00:11:59,172
Besides, they got

218
00:11:59,506 --> 00:12:01,470
real excellent
medical facilities here.

219
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:12,064


220
00:12:33,026 --> 00:12:34,977
- Grace, you coming?
- Sorry.

221
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:38,398
Is something wrong?

222
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:42,427
I was thinking about Jane.
I hope he's all right.

223
00:12:42,692 --> 00:12:45,392
He'll be fine.
Maybe he'll learn something.

224
00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:47,791
Hi. Are you Gail?

225
00:12:51,398 --> 00:12:52,658
Is your mom here?

226
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,109
You're the police?

227
00:12:57,737 --> 00:13:00,337
Yes, we are.
Can you take us to your mom?

228
00:13:00,718 --> 00:13:02,322
Are you gonna bring my daddy home?

229
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:06,582
No, seetie, I'm sorry.
We can't do that.

230
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,646
Good morning, everybody.

231
00:13:35,308 --> 00:13:36,440
Morning, pig.

232
00:13:41,531 --> 00:13:44,559
Thank you for raising that issue.
Let me address that.

233
00:13:44,684 --> 00:13:47,811
You believe me to be a policeman
That is not true.

234
00:13:47,936 --> 00:13:49,703
I am not, nor have I ever been one.

235
00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:54,136
I do work with the police.
I use my skills to catch murderers,

236
00:13:54,261 --> 00:13:57,252
Though rarely do I deal.
With professionals such as yourselves.

237
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:58,903
What skills?

238
00:14:01,539 --> 00:14:02,591
People skills.

239
00:14:02,989 --> 00:14:05,539
You show me your skills,
little brother.

240
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,179
You...

241
00:14:07,807 --> 00:14:08,763
You...

242
00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:11,766
Are the shot-caller.

243
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,505
You come from the bay area.

244
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:18,356
You like to sniff some kind
of glue or solvent to get high.

245
00:14:18,633 --> 00:14:20,835
You wish you could quit,
'cause you think it makes you

246
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,798
- Look weak in front of your peers.
- Is that right?

247
00:14:24,212 --> 00:14:26,062
Yes, but you needn't worry,

248
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,184
Because the way you are
when you get high

249
00:14:28,309 --> 00:14:31,036
Makes everybody even more
scared of you, right?

250
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:33,079
Hell, man. Yeah.

251
00:14:38,764 --> 00:14:40,378
I don't think I like you much.

252
00:14:40,633 --> 00:14:43,882
If you stop seeing the world in terms
of what you like and what you dislike.

253
00:14:44,219 --> 00:14:46,259
And saw things
for what they truly are

254
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,858
in themselves. You would find

255
00:14:47,983 --> 00:14:50,305
a great deal more peace.
And I can help you with that

256
00:14:50,622 --> 00:14:51,722
if you want.

257
00:14:52,717 --> 00:14:53,517
Think.

258
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,813
Where's the phone?
I need to make a call.

259
00:14:56,845 --> 00:14:57,751
Over there.

260
00:14:57,876 --> 00:14:58,876
Thanks.

261
00:15:02,391 --> 00:15:03,818
This is nice. Thank you.

262
00:15:04,718 --> 00:15:07,068
- Did you make these?
- We both did.

263
00:15:07,193 --> 00:15:09,991
- We're keeping ourselves busy.
- Delicious.

264
00:15:11,179 --> 00:15:14,027
Your show's in the VCR,
if you want to watch it a while.

265
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,564
We're sorry for your loss, Donna.

266
00:15:22,574 --> 00:15:23,574
It's hard.

267
00:15:23,973 --> 00:15:24,973
It's hard.

268
00:15:25,328 --> 00:15:27,480
Just when things
were getting better.

269
00:15:27,605 --> 00:15:29,305
Things were going badly?

270
00:15:31,948 --> 00:15:33,198
Marriage stuff.

271
00:15:33,727 --> 00:15:35,892
Me and Kobe have been together
since junior high.

272
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:39,229
- People change when they grow up.
- How so?

273
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,436
We kind of drifted, I guess.

274
00:15:43,561 --> 00:15:46,518
My family, the gerbers...
we're very close.

275
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:50,146
It can be too much what with us
living here together and all.

276
00:15:50,646 --> 00:15:52,075
Kobe got to feeling kind of

277
00:15:52,808 --> 00:15:54,286
squashed up against them.

278
00:15:54,948 --> 00:15:56,648
He was a lone wolf type.

279
00:15:57,243 --> 00:15:58,243
Liked...

280
00:15:58,886 --> 00:16:00,500
to be in the woods on his own.

281
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:01,960
Was there anyone,

282
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,588
he had a problem with
or who had a problem with him?

283
00:16:07,597 --> 00:16:08,597
Just me

284
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,931
Like i say we have been
doing better recently.

285
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:16,243
He's been more honesty with me,
opening up about his feelings.

286
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,052
- You know men can be.
- Yes, we do.

287
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,482
Money problems?

288
00:16:25,201 --> 00:16:27,666
No, mam, Kirby was a skilled father.

289
00:16:28,971 --> 00:16:31,615
Always a good provider
and I'm proud of it.

290
00:16:31,951 --> 00:16:34,492
And you have
the oil money coming in.

291
00:16:37,183 --> 00:16:38,079
Yes Mam

292
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:39,789
How much do your cousins get?

293
00:16:41,328 --> 00:16:42,328
They say,

294
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,049
each of single cousins
will get 80,000 dollars of year.

295
00:16:47,817 --> 00:16:49,867
I have to point this out, Donna.

296
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:51,468
I get a strong motive here.

297
00:16:52,113 --> 00:16:53,261
Kirby is entitled

298
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,793
half of your money,
if your marriage is in trouble

299
00:16:56,034 --> 00:16:58,379
That would make you pretty unhappy,
wouldn't it?

300
00:16:58,905 --> 00:17:00,902
Our marriage isn't in trouble.

301
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,867
Connor tells us there are many
unhealed brushes

302
00:17:03,992 --> 00:17:05,092
on his body.

303
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:09,075
Which suggests 3 weeks before his death,
he was pretty badly beaten up.

304
00:17:09,633 --> 00:17:11,783
I don't know anything about that.

305
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,582
<i>Next time you feel
the urge to get high,</i>

306
00:17:18,748 --> 00:17:21,853
Maybe you will see
your mother's smiling face.

307
00:17:23,186 --> 00:17:25,305
Maybe you will feel more

308
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,618
safe and happy.

309
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:31,852
Maybe you will realise
that your feeling get from drugs,

310
00:17:32,305 --> 00:17:33,426
is illusion.

311
00:17:33,851 --> 00:17:37,263
Nothing more than chemicals
swaying around your brain.

312
00:17:37,826 --> 00:17:40,183
<i>Jane you may change
to the visiting room.</i>

313
00:17:45,225 --> 00:17:46,147
More later,

314
00:17:46,702 --> 00:17:48,565
you are doing great.

315
00:18:08,928 --> 00:18:10,737
That's case paper work so far.

316
00:18:10,862 --> 00:18:12,891
That's the copy
of the victim's notebook.

317
00:18:13,348 --> 00:18:15,135
Nothing than Sudoku puzzles.

318
00:18:18,086 --> 00:18:21,099
- Still like losting for us?
- He's got attitude and motive.

319
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:24,519
The connors' said Kirby was
badly beaten up a month ago,

320
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:26,146
at which time he was in custody

321
00:18:26,415 --> 00:18:28,606
on a DY and resisting-arrest beef.

322
00:18:28,884 --> 00:18:30,775
Could've been one
of the lost friends there.

323
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,861
Only hans never reported beating,

324
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:35,363
didn't go to hospital
neither wife had acknowledge of it.

325
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,951
I think Kirby's wife
might keep the beating quiet

326
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:39,724
'cause it's a family matter.

327
00:18:40,032 --> 00:18:42,085
That's what's
with the father in law now.

328
00:18:42,854 --> 00:18:45,756
Kirby was beaten list month?
I don't recall that.

329
00:18:46,415 --> 00:18:50,125
Judging by the react i asked about her,
seems like a family matter.

330
00:18:50,412 --> 00:18:53,581
Maybe you and you son Donny
got in their marrital problem?

331
00:18:54,586 --> 00:18:56,270
Mam, that's way off.

332
00:18:56,729 --> 00:18:58,029
Hey, baby cakes.

333
00:18:59,626 --> 00:19:02,432
- You okay? Are you sick or something?
- Do i look sick?

334
00:19:02,736 --> 00:19:05,158
It's not like you walking around
in sweats, no makeup,

335
00:19:05,283 --> 00:19:07,228
- your hair all up like that.
- Excuse me.

336
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:10,013
My stepdaughter's husband just died.
I'm grieving.

337
00:19:10,944 --> 00:19:13,178
- That's cool. That's cool.
- Who's your friend?

338
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:16,112
This is agent Lisbon from CBI,
cooming for poor Kirby.

339
00:19:16,424 --> 00:19:17,774
My wife Sandrine.

340
00:19:19,198 --> 00:19:21,993
- I need to go to the mall.
- What's your theory, Sandrine?

341
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,511
Who killed Kirby?

342
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,810
I don't know.

343
00:19:25,508 --> 00:19:28,082
Do I have to have an answer?
I thought that was you guys' job.

344
00:19:28,492 --> 00:19:29,626
Worth asking.

345
00:19:29,857 --> 00:19:32,265
I'll be honest.
I'm sorry Kirby's dead,

346
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:35,131
But i'm not sorry my daughter
isn't married to a loser anymore.

347
00:19:35,811 --> 00:19:37,461
And why was he a loser?

348
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:38,879
He was a buzzkill.

349
00:19:39,004 --> 00:19:40,603
The Gerber family's moving on up,

350
00:19:40,728 --> 00:19:43,253
and Kirby didn't like that.
He liked being poor and whatever.

351
00:19:43,378 --> 00:19:45,890
No vision. Donna deserves
more than that.

352
00:19:46,274 --> 00:19:47,374
Right, Sand?

353
00:19:48,168 --> 00:19:49,518
She's a treasure.

354
00:19:55,046 --> 00:19:56,146
Agent Bosco,

355
00:19:56,443 --> 00:19:57,676
- a word?
- Sure.

356
00:19:58,102 --> 00:20:00,157
I won't take up your time
shooting the breeze,

357
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,851
- beating around the bush.
- So?

358
00:20:01,976 --> 00:20:03,529
We want to talk about Jane.

359
00:20:04,128 --> 00:20:05,954
We know that Jane crossed the line.

360
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,563
But you help us out here
and we'll be extremely grateful.

361
00:20:08,688 --> 00:20:10,338
We'll owe you big-time.

362
00:20:12,935 --> 00:20:13,935
Okay.

363
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,079
I see.

364
00:20:17,244 --> 00:20:19,643
Let's say I, reach out for you

365
00:20:19,768 --> 00:20:21,028
to do some stuff.

366
00:20:22,196 --> 00:20:23,448
What kind of stuff?

367
00:20:24,294 --> 00:20:26,826
The kind of stuff
that needs to get done sometimes,

368
00:20:27,276 --> 00:20:30,186
To take the bad guys down.
Keep the good guys walking around.

369
00:20:30,608 --> 00:20:31,771
Nothing illegal.

370
00:20:32,042 --> 00:20:34,274
Maybe a little rule bending
on the download.

371
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:35,555
That's no problem.

372
00:20:38,024 --> 00:20:39,571
See, that's my exact point.

373
00:20:40,371 --> 00:20:41,623
There is a problem.

374
00:20:42,624 --> 00:20:44,550
There's no rule bending in the CBI.

375
00:20:45,685 --> 00:20:47,271
You two guys are good agents,

376
00:20:47,396 --> 00:20:49,519
- but Jane is corrupted you.
- No, he hasn't.

377
00:20:50,025 --> 00:20:52,458
So you were ready to bend the rules
before he got here?

378
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:56,588
- Thanks for your time.
- Nice talking to you.

379
00:20:59,501 --> 00:21:00,425
"Vultures".

380
00:21:02,592 --> 00:21:03,877
What does that mean?

381
00:21:04,667 --> 00:21:06,317
Who are Jay and Martin?

382
00:21:06,446 --> 00:21:08,849
You know, vultures pee
on their legs to cool themselves.

383
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:10,584
Is that right?

384
00:21:14,726 --> 00:21:15,976
Yes, of course.

385
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:19,044
What does "vultures" mean?

386
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,778
Vultures are birds.

387
00:21:21,153 --> 00:21:22,193
No kidding.

388
00:21:22,318 --> 00:21:23,781
<i>Hines was a bird-watcher.</i>

389
00:21:24,141 --> 00:21:26,868
That's why he had binoculars.
He saw Jays

390
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:28,077
<i>and Martins.</i>

391
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:29,254
And vultures.

392
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:31,748
Got it.
Good, so that's a dead-end.

393
00:21:32,093 --> 00:21:33,880
On the contrary,
it's a breakthrough.

394
00:21:34,005 --> 00:21:36,419
I need to speak with Gerber.
I've some questions.

395
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:39,213
Rigsby's going to meet him.
I'll tell him what to ask him.

396
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:42,175
Where is the funny for me.
Can't you bring Gerber in here?

397
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:45,245
Okay, no problem. I'll sort it out.

398
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,702
I'll call you back.

399
00:21:57,104 --> 00:21:57,899
Jaily!

400
00:21:58,145 --> 00:21:59,923
I just want to give you
the heads-up.

401
00:22:00,048 --> 00:22:02,664
I have a very strong feeling
Gerber is gonna be hostile

402
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:05,701
and aggressive towards you.
So you should probably be

403
00:22:05,826 --> 00:22:07,431
very careful with him.

404
00:22:08,009 --> 00:22:10,470
Don't worry.
I think I can handle Roddy Gerber.

405
00:22:11,512 --> 00:22:13,915
I'm just warning you.
He's a very tough guy.

406
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:17,460
I'd like to see him try something,
we'll see how tough he is.

407
00:22:17,709 --> 00:22:18,709
Whatever.

408
00:22:25,496 --> 00:22:26,514
<i>Roddy Gerber?</i>

409
00:22:26,873 --> 00:22:28,137
Who wants to know?

410
00:22:28,509 --> 00:22:29,581
Agent Rigsby,

411
00:22:29,706 --> 00:22:31,808
CBI. I'm on my way, I have questions

412
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:33,705
<i>I'd like to ask you first...</i>

413
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:34,830
<i>Discreetly.</i>

414
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:38,588
I've heard from a couple
of reliable sources

415
00:22:38,713 --> 00:22:41,150
that you and Kirby Hine
were having an affair.

416
00:22:42,076 --> 00:22:42,986
<i>Some kind of</i>

417
00:22:43,703 --> 00:22:44,988
sexual relationship.

418
00:22:45,988 --> 00:22:48,282
<i>- That's a damn lie.
- Are you sure, Roddy?</i>

419
00:22:48,753 --> 00:22:51,452
Lying to a CBI agent
is a very serious offense.

420
00:22:51,847 --> 00:22:53,476
I was in the marine corps.

421
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,980
Oh, really?
Well, that says it all. I'm ex-army.

422
00:22:57,105 --> 00:22:58,626
Marine corps suck eggs.

423
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:00,779
<i>But... no point in arguing
over the phone.</i>

424
00:23:00,904 --> 00:23:02,795
We'll sort this out when i get out.

425
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,535
<i>Semper fi, sissy britches.</i>

426
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,460
Thank you so much for coming.

427
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:46,185


428
00:23:46,694 --> 00:23:47,587
So, Roddy,

429
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,314
tell me about the vultures.

430
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:52,794
- I know nothing.
- Sure you do.

431
00:23:54,542 --> 00:23:55,912
I don't like your tone.

432
00:23:57,214 --> 00:23:59,645
We talking or we playing? Come on.

433
00:23:59,909 --> 00:24:02,894
Kirby found turkey vultures
nesting on your land, didn't he?

434
00:24:04,097 --> 00:24:05,097
He didn't.

435
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,035
Turkey vultures are dying out

436
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:10,531
because of a loss of habitat.
They're a protected species.

437
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,200
- Is that right?
- It is.

438
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:14,243
Seriously,
you're disrespecting the game.

439
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:16,686
Thank you.

440
00:24:16,811 --> 00:24:18,539
One moment. They're protected,

441
00:24:19,385 --> 00:24:21,346
Which means
if they're nesting on your land,

442
00:24:21,471 --> 00:24:23,628
You can't drill for the oil,
you don't get rich.

443
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:27,239
- That right?
- Yes, it is.

444
00:24:28,139 --> 00:24:29,801
When Kirby tells you about the nest,

445
00:24:30,165 --> 00:24:33,012
you tell him to show you
where the nest is to destroy it.

446
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:37,208
Only he didn't tell you,
you beat him up until he does tell you.

447
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:39,894
You shoot the vultures,
and you destroy the nest.

448
00:24:41,607 --> 00:24:43,423
Bad luck to kill large birds

449
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:44,767
unless you eat 'em.

450
00:24:44,892 --> 00:24:46,776
- You didn't eat 'em, did you?
- Hell no!

451
00:24:47,667 --> 00:24:50,446
- But you admit you shot 'em though,
- They're vultures, man.

452
00:24:50,756 --> 00:24:52,684
You think i'm gonna give up
a million bucks

453
00:24:52,809 --> 00:24:55,713
over a couple ugly basterds
who eat dead people?

454
00:24:56,186 --> 00:24:57,203
No frickin' way.

455
00:24:58,068 --> 00:24:59,249
So you shot 'em.

456
00:25:00,649 --> 00:25:01,499
I did.

457
00:25:01,992 --> 00:25:03,167
Anybody would.

458
00:25:03,808 --> 00:25:05,044
I can't disagree.

459
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:06,212
And Kirby?

460
00:25:07,637 --> 00:25:08,464
Not me.

461
00:25:08,913 --> 00:25:10,427
I kicked his ass, yeah.

462
00:25:11,694 --> 00:25:12,973
I didn't kill him.

463
00:25:13,098 --> 00:25:14,098
No need.

464
00:25:14,223 --> 00:25:15,596
What he gonna do to me?

465
00:25:16,158 --> 00:25:18,599
You swear on your mother's grave
you didn't kill Kirby?

466
00:25:19,511 --> 00:25:21,311
I swear on my mom's grave,

467
00:25:22,314 --> 00:25:23,771
i didn't kill Kirby.

468
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,122
Interesting.

469
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,516
I think you should take lead.
It's a female thing.

470
00:25:31,641 --> 00:25:33,531
No, it's not.
She's female that's all.

471
00:25:33,656 --> 00:25:35,491
He's not. You should take lead.

472
00:25:35,976 --> 00:25:36,909
Why me?

473
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,968
You're always being... too direct.

474
00:25:39,093 --> 00:25:40,404
She won't be offended.

475
00:25:40,529 --> 00:25:42,665
- Who won't be offended?
- Nothing.

476
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:44,038
Well...

477
00:25:45,349 --> 00:25:46,799
We were thinking...

478
00:25:49,767 --> 00:25:50,882
Thinking's good.

479
00:25:51,269 --> 00:25:52,269
About?

480
00:25:53,001 --> 00:25:55,011
We asked to Bosco
to give Jane a break,

481
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:56,220
but he wouldn't.

482
00:25:56,685 --> 00:25:58,513
We were thinking maybe
if you ask him

483
00:25:58,638 --> 00:26:01,663
to let Jane go,
between friends, he'd do it.

484
00:26:02,344 --> 00:26:03,503
Why?

485
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:04,997
- Well...
- It's obvious.

486
00:26:05,122 --> 00:26:06,858
He has a thing for you,
sexual thing.

487
00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:08,399
Not like an affair.

488
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,776
- It's just...
- He likes you a lot, it seems...

489
00:26:11,619 --> 00:26:13,383
The way he looks at you sometimes.

490
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,127
You're mistaken.

491
00:26:15,252 --> 00:26:17,219
Bosco has
no particular liking for me,

492
00:26:17,344 --> 00:26:20,036
and even if he did,
i wouldn't use it as leverage for Jane.

493
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:23,164
- Why not?
- Because the law is the law.

494
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:26,626
Jane broke the law, and now
he's got to pay the consequences.

495
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:32,965
Hi, Jane.

496
00:26:34,833 --> 00:26:36,385
I need you to come visit me.

497
00:26:36,643 --> 00:26:37,943
Why? We're busy.

498
00:26:38,429 --> 00:26:39,679
Please, Lisbon?

499
00:26:39,944 --> 00:26:42,210
It's really important.
I need to see you.

500
00:26:42,335 --> 00:26:43,726
Also a blueberry muffin.

501
00:27:04,718 --> 00:27:05,623
Cranberry?

502
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,459
They didn't have any blueberry.
What's up?

503
00:27:12,981 --> 00:27:14,632
Roddy Gerber's innocent.

504
00:27:14,976 --> 00:27:15,976
That's it?

505
00:27:16,524 --> 00:27:17,624
Pretty much.

506
00:27:17,788 --> 00:27:18,788
Well, no.

507
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,339
Roddy beat up Kirby so he'd tell him

508
00:27:21,464 --> 00:27:23,358
where the protected vultures
were nesting

509
00:27:23,483 --> 00:27:26,126
So Roddy could kill them,
but he says he didn't kill Kirby.

510
00:27:26,251 --> 00:27:28,562
And I believe him.
He swore on his mother's grave.

511
00:27:29,515 --> 00:27:31,941
Interesting, But you could have
told me that on the phone.

512
00:27:32,596 --> 00:27:34,046
I needed a visitor.

513
00:27:34,514 --> 00:27:36,279
So i could get into
the visitors room.

514
00:27:36,871 --> 00:27:38,571
How I wish I had my gun.

515
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,569
Crime-fighting's hard.
Suck it up.

516
00:27:41,903 --> 00:27:43,828
- That's why we're here.
- Dooley Gerber?

517
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:46,497
- I need to ask him a question.
- What question?

518
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:47,816
It doesn't matter.

519
00:27:47,941 --> 00:27:50,553
Can you keep the guard off me?
Could you, please?

520
00:27:51,938 --> 00:27:52,938
It's okay.

521
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,719
Dooley, you can tell me.
The truth is you killed your son-in-law.

522
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,144
Isn't that true?

523
00:28:03,021 --> 00:28:04,223
And who are you now?

524
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,618
That's a very good answer.

525
00:28:06,743 --> 00:28:07,743
Thank you.

526
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:14,483
So?

527
00:28:14,849 --> 00:28:16,026
What'd you learn?

528
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:17,680
That was a control question.

529
00:28:17,805 --> 00:28:20,017
The next question I ask him
is the critical one.

530
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:22,908
I don't need my gun.
I can just hit you with my chair.

531
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:25,308
I think you'll find
it's bolted to the floor.

532
00:28:25,433 --> 00:28:27,773
Do you understand
what's happening to you?

533
00:28:28,485 --> 00:28:29,915
You could get a prison sentence.

534
00:28:30,693 --> 00:28:32,802
I understand
that you're keeping me in jail

535
00:28:32,927 --> 00:28:35,134
in the hopes
that you will teach me a lesson.

536
00:28:35,259 --> 00:28:38,017
- It's not gonna work.
- I am not keeping you in jail.

537
00:28:38,142 --> 00:28:39,467
The law do it.

538
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:41,382
The law, as played by Sam Bosco.

539
00:28:41,507 --> 00:28:45,139
And you can make Sam Bosco
do anything whenever you like.

540
00:28:45,651 --> 00:28:46,575
Right.

541
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,853
Because he's so in love with me,
I can make him do whatever he could.

542
00:28:50,638 --> 00:28:51,638
Yes.

543
00:28:52,944 --> 00:28:54,231
I was only saying that.

544
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,650
Because that's what the guys
were just saying.

545
00:28:57,325 --> 00:28:58,825
It's total nonsense.

546
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,404
Sam Bosco is a happily married man.

547
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,158
He hasn't the faintest
interest in me that way.

548
00:29:04,554 --> 00:29:07,007
I have no influence
over him whatsoever.

549
00:29:07,132 --> 00:29:09,186
The guys noticed it, too?
I'm impressed.

550
00:29:09,311 --> 00:29:11,739
He's very recessive in his passions.

551
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:14,418
Hard to spot
that he'd kill and die for you.

552
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,400
Trust me, you are way off.

553
00:29:16,999 --> 00:29:18,890
Interesting puzzle you present.

554
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,325
Lies and truth all mixed together.

555
00:29:24,056 --> 00:29:24,865
Look,

556
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,813
I hope we can get you
out of this mess.

557
00:29:26,938 --> 00:29:28,301
But it's also true

558
00:29:28,605 --> 00:29:31,486
that I do hope
that you learn a lesson from this.

559
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,639
There are real boundaries in life.

560
00:29:33,764 --> 00:29:35,189
These are real prison walls.

561
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:38,354
Only in your mind, Lisbon.
Only in your mind.

562
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:55,207
Help!

563
00:31:55,332 --> 00:31:56,484
Help! Deputy!

564
00:31:56,834 --> 00:31:59,291
We got a man down, man!
He ain't moving!

565
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,418
Deputy, I got a man down! Help me!

566
00:32:03,494 --> 00:32:06,090
Oh, crap.
We have an inmate down, level nine.

567
00:32:06,615 --> 00:32:08,615
Number eight out like a light.

568
00:32:09,016 --> 00:32:11,135
- Did you do this?
- No, man, I didn't touch him!

569
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,810
He just ain't movin'!

570
00:32:28,715 --> 00:32:29,767
'Sup with him?

571
00:32:29,892 --> 00:32:31,907
If I know.
He was like this when I got there.

572
00:32:32,585 --> 00:32:34,788
Okay, leave him here.
I'll call the medic.

573
00:32:34,913 --> 00:32:36,728
You guys go get back on post.

574
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,490
Got a customer for you.

575
00:32:46,622 --> 00:32:47,622
Okay.

576
00:32:57,639 --> 00:32:59,139
What are you saying?

577
00:33:00,868 --> 00:33:01,868
My hand.

578
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:04,414
Hand?

579
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:12,959
Steve, come quick.

580
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:16,785
We got a problem, Steve.
I need help.

581
00:33:17,101 --> 00:33:18,201
I need help!

582
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,331
Someone! Someone!

583
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,088
Help!

584
00:33:35,293 --> 00:33:36,293
After you.

585
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,120
Help!

586
00:33:42,505 --> 00:33:43,581
Somebody!

587
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:47,779


588
00:34:02,043 --> 00:34:04,047
Lisbon, I had a horrible dream.

589
00:34:04,172 --> 00:34:06,453
I dreamt that Jane
escaped the county jail.

590
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:09,199
I dreamt that the sheriff,
the A.G. and the district super.

591
00:34:09,324 --> 00:34:11,173
All called to yell at me.

592
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:14,495
Now, you're gonna wake me up, yes?

593
00:34:15,071 --> 00:34:16,298
I'm sorry, sir.

594
00:34:16,423 --> 00:34:19,509
I have no excuse for him.
He is beyond out of line.

595
00:34:20,111 --> 00:34:21,511
He's blown it, all right.

596
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,446
We have an A.P.B. out.

597
00:34:23,571 --> 00:34:26,406
But maybe you can contact him,
persuade him to coming quiet.

598
00:34:27,291 --> 00:34:28,732
Nobody wants him to get hurt.

599
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:30,201
Contact him how?

600
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:31,478
Persuade him how?

601
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:33,580
You two are close.
He'll listen to you.

602
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,699
- That's very funny.
- Why is it funny?

603
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:36,874
It just is.

604
00:34:39,345 --> 00:34:40,345
<i>Hi, Sam.</i>

605
00:34:40,998 --> 00:34:41,998
<i>It's me.</i>

606
00:34:42,158 --> 00:34:43,358
Where are you?

607
00:34:44,571 --> 00:34:45,624
<i>Dooley's house.</i>

608
00:34:45,931 --> 00:34:48,377
If you send the sheriff over,
I'll have Kirby's killer

609
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:50,095
in ten minutes or so.

610
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:51,797
Jane, you damn fool!

611
00:34:52,913 --> 00:34:53,913
Thank you.

612
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:57,514
What the hell are you talking about?
You said you had Kirby's killer.

613
00:34:57,939 --> 00:35:00,389
Not yet,
but I like to be an optimist.

614
00:35:00,642 --> 00:35:03,516
You wouldn't have the makings
of a cup of tea, would you?

615
00:35:05,392 --> 00:35:07,061
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

616
00:35:10,832 --> 00:35:13,277
So listen, Roddy told me
about the vultures.

617
00:35:13,446 --> 00:35:15,081
And what he did to Kirby.

618
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,821
How did you cope with that Donna?

619
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:20,598
Your husband being
beaten by your brother?

620
00:35:20,912 --> 00:35:22,327
How did you feel about that?

621
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,335
- Angry.
- With who?

622
00:35:24,633 --> 00:35:25,633
Myself,

623
00:35:26,296 --> 00:35:27,124
my family.

624
00:35:27,651 --> 00:35:29,820
Kirby was a good man,
and I let him down.

625
00:35:29,945 --> 00:35:31,695
No. No, daddy, it's true.

626
00:35:32,015 --> 00:35:34,339
I let the money blind me.
We all did.

627
00:35:34,852 --> 00:35:37,885
- Excuse me. I got stuff to do.
- Please don't go, Sandrine.

628
00:35:38,054 --> 00:35:39,740
I was just gonna say how funny it is

629
00:35:39,865 --> 00:35:42,610
When you have a big family fight,
it can clarify a situation.

630
00:35:42,894 --> 00:35:44,491
Do you think that happened at all?

631
00:35:44,616 --> 00:35:46,393
- I wish.
- Maybe Kirby

632
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:47,655
found clarity.

633
00:35:48,149 --> 00:35:49,931
Maybe kirby realized

634
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:52,846
how, important it was
for him to be truthful.

635
00:35:54,745 --> 00:35:56,396
When we found poor Kirby,

636
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,875
he had some flecks of glitter
on his face.

637
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,377
And when I saw you,
Dooley, at the prison.

638
00:36:01,661 --> 00:36:03,798
You had some glitter
on your face, too.

639
00:36:04,081 --> 00:36:07,383
Which means you and Kirby
were in close contact,

640
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,957
to the same woman.

641
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:10,876
A woman who likes to wear glitter.

642
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:13,419
That would be you, Sandrine.

643
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,424
- You're stupid.
- Often.

644
00:36:19,142 --> 00:36:21,470
But I now also see that neither

645
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:23,344
Dooley nor Donna

646
00:36:24,162 --> 00:36:27,594
had any notion of this connection
between you and he.

647
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:30,773
Which means Kirby was
very considerate...

648
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:33,514
Considerate enough to warn you
before he came clean

649
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:34,795
about your affair.

650
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,904
I swear on my life
there was no affair.

651
00:36:39,073 --> 00:36:40,228
Sure there was.

652
00:36:40,353 --> 00:36:42,908
You were bored and frustrated.
He was available.

653
00:36:44,684 --> 00:36:46,286
Kirby soon expose you,

654
00:36:46,612 --> 00:36:48,287
and he broke it off, yes?

655
00:36:48,614 --> 00:36:50,374
He wanted to get out
of Sutter Valley.

656
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:52,879
He wanted to start
a new life with his wife.

657
00:36:53,004 --> 00:36:54,628
The woman that he did love.

658
00:36:55,165 --> 00:36:56,547
But first he felt compelled

659
00:36:57,277 --> 00:37:00,236
to have to tell everybody the truth,
the fool.

660
00:37:00,511 --> 00:37:02,719
He was gonna ruin your life
over what...

661
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:06,019
some birds?
For a beating that he possibly deserved.

662
00:37:06,144 --> 00:37:08,711
Why would he do that?
You begged him not to tell.

663
00:37:08,923 --> 00:37:10,123
You begged him

664
00:37:10,449 --> 00:37:11,854
and he just wouldn't listen.

665
00:37:13,256 --> 00:37:14,767
This is all a lie.

666
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:17,708
- That never happened.
- Yeah, you had to kill him

667
00:37:17,833 --> 00:37:19,194
right there and then.

668
00:37:20,181 --> 00:37:22,573
It's a lie. It's a lie.

669
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:26,292
I'm sorry, Sandrine, but we have
conclusive forensic evidence

670
00:37:26,417 --> 00:37:28,158
from our boys at the crime lab.

671
00:37:28,793 --> 00:37:32,124
The glitter on Kirby's face
covered in your D.N.A., covered.

672
00:37:33,073 --> 00:37:34,723
And D.N.A. doesn't lie.

673
00:37:36,734 --> 00:37:40,173
I don't know where that came from,
'cause it wasn't me.

674
00:37:40,436 --> 00:37:41,831
Police are on their way.

675
00:37:41,956 --> 00:37:44,803
I'd be honest with your family,
you may not see them for a while.

676
00:37:53,727 --> 00:37:56,179
- Oh, please!
- Tell me that it isn't true.

677
00:37:56,679 --> 00:37:58,882
He made me do it.

678
00:37:59,098 --> 00:38:01,209
- He made you do it?
- He made me do it!

679
00:38:01,334 --> 00:38:03,280
- She'll have her punishment.
- Not enough!

680
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,665
Patrick Jane,
we know you're in there.

681
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,394
Come out with your hands up.

682
00:38:21,534 --> 00:38:23,503
It's me they're after, not you.

683
00:38:23,806 --> 00:38:25,802
And there is
no D.N.A. evidence either.

684
00:38:26,168 --> 00:38:28,597
That scientific, forensic stuff,
it's all overrated.

685
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:31,850
Thank you for the tea.
No take-backs.

686
00:38:39,278 --> 00:38:41,593
I'm coming now! Don't shoot.

687
00:38:53,907 --> 00:38:54,907
Thank you.

688
00:39:08,454 --> 00:39:10,868
Jane got a confession
from Sandrine Gerber.

689
00:39:11,258 --> 00:39:12,358
Case closed.

690
00:39:12,886 --> 00:39:16,158
Yeah, the A.G. likely
won't make it stick, what with...

691
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:19,363
his key witness
being in jail himself.

692
00:39:19,488 --> 00:39:23,208
In for a good, long spell
once added in the skip charges.

693
00:39:24,434 --> 00:39:26,552
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

694
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:29,032
I thought this would
teach Jane a lesson.

695
00:39:29,271 --> 00:39:31,985
I thought he'd back down
or apologize, but he didn't,

696
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:33,787
and now it's gone too far.

697
00:39:34,547 --> 00:39:35,799
You gotta let him go.

698
00:39:36,108 --> 00:39:38,625
If you drop the charges,
the A.G. won't chase it.

699
00:39:41,058 --> 00:39:42,944
What if I don't want to do that?

700
00:39:45,721 --> 00:39:47,321
Don't make me go there, Sam.

701
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:53,432
What are you saying, exactly?

702
00:39:54,028 --> 00:39:55,623
You know what I'm saying.

703
00:39:56,722 --> 00:39:59,282
I'll talk about
what happened eight years ago.

704
00:40:03,513 --> 00:40:04,670
You'd go there?

705
00:40:06,311 --> 00:40:07,311
Really?

706
00:40:08,809 --> 00:40:11,079
- I don't believe you.
- Believe me.

707
00:40:11,312 --> 00:40:12,312
Here I am.

708
00:40:17,459 --> 00:40:19,280
You would ruin our lives,

709
00:40:19,746 --> 00:40:21,149
our careers,

710
00:40:22,161 --> 00:40:23,161
over Jane?

711
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:26,602
Does he mean that much to you?

712
00:40:26,727 --> 00:40:28,027
He closes cases.

713
00:40:28,424 --> 00:40:30,029
"He closes cases."

714
00:40:32,126 --> 00:40:33,180
Is that all it is?

715
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:40,780
If you don't let Jane go,

716
00:40:40,989 --> 00:40:42,481
I'll talk. That's all.

717
00:40:46,918 --> 00:40:48,288
What are you gonna do?

718
00:40:56,354 --> 00:40:57,568
Okay, you did good.

719
00:40:58,428 --> 00:40:59,952
There's 2 things puzzling me.

720
00:41:00,077 --> 00:41:02,730
How did you get out of jail,
how did you get a change of clothes?

721
00:41:02,855 --> 00:41:05,404
- I'm glad you asked that question.
- It was very...

722
00:41:07,014 --> 00:41:09,094
- ... simple.
- So they let you out, then?

723
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:11,883
They did. Thank you very much.

724
00:41:12,651 --> 00:41:14,035
Nothing do with me.

725
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:15,973
So modest.

726
00:41:17,535 --> 00:41:20,143
Right, Bosco's so in love with me,
he'll do whatever I say.

727
00:41:22,971 --> 00:41:24,513
It's a little far-fetched.

728
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:27,540
He does love you. How could he not?

729
00:41:28,041 --> 00:41:31,341
But he's not the type to bend
his principles over love.

730
00:41:31,979 --> 00:41:35,659
I figure it's something more concrete.
You must have something on him.

731
00:41:36,363 --> 00:41:37,913
- You think?
- Yes.

732
00:41:38,619 --> 00:41:40,939
Something he did wrong.

733
00:41:41,278 --> 00:41:43,391
Something very bad
that you know about.

734
00:41:43,516 --> 00:41:46,216
Now he's not the type
to steal or do drugs,

735
00:41:46,514 --> 00:41:49,125
So my guess... he hurts someone.

736
00:41:51,197 --> 00:41:52,281
He killed him.

737
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:55,269
He killed a bad guy
that he couldn't catch any other way.

738
00:41:57,336 --> 00:41:58,723
And you helped him do it.

739
00:42:00,487 --> 00:42:03,988
You found out after the fact,
and you...

740
00:42:04,712 --> 00:42:07,912
let him off the hook
because the bad guy deserved it.

741
00:42:11,067 --> 00:42:14,084
I'm touched that you would risk
your career over me.

742
00:42:14,209 --> 00:42:15,614
That means a lot to me.

743
00:42:16,439 --> 00:42:19,189
If you're right,
and I'm not saying you are,

744
00:42:19,517 --> 00:42:22,536
It would mean I broke
the trust of somebody I respect

745
00:42:22,661 --> 00:42:24,040
and admire for your sake.

746
00:42:25,557 --> 00:42:27,460
If it is true,
I would hope in the future

747
00:42:27,585 --> 00:42:31,485
you'd be a little bit more mature
and responsible in your behavior.

748
00:42:32,254 --> 00:42:35,204
I'm grateful and all that,
but let's not go crazy here.

749
00:42:35,624 --> 00:42:37,429
I should have let you rot in jail.
