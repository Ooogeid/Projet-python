1
00:01:21,731 --> 00:01:22,957
Vic's Noah Valiquette.

2
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,688
32. Lives a few blocks away.

3
00:01:24,943 --> 00:01:26,544
The local P.D.
says a clown shot him,

4
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,922
- cut off his finger.
- A clown? Which finger?

5
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:31,632
- Right index.
- Witnesses?

6
00:01:31,913 --> 00:01:33,852
The convenience store owner
heard the shot,

7
00:01:33,977 --> 00:01:35,398
glimpse the suspect taking off.

8
00:01:35,523 --> 00:01:38,556
I'm thinking that shooter
forced him into the alley, to kill him.

9
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:39,849
He took the finger?

10
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:41,267
Looks that way.

11
00:01:42,867 --> 00:01:44,395
Uses for a detached

12
00:01:44,769 --> 00:01:45,771
index finger.

13
00:01:46,202 --> 00:01:47,356
Sending a message?

14
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:49,900
You from CBI?

15
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,902
Agent Teresa Lisbon.
This is Patrick Jane.

16
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,280
Ellis Hindon.
Glad your office is close.

17
00:01:54,486 --> 00:01:57,552
This is a little out of our league.
We tried not to screw it up.

18
00:01:58,002 --> 00:02:01,322
Preserved the crime scene,
canvassed the area for witnesses

19
00:02:01,447 --> 00:02:03,274
and put out a description
of the attacker.

20
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:06,455
It sounds like you guys know
what you're doing. Why call us?

21
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,586
This is who we picked up
off the description.

22
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:25,747
They're all crying on the inside.

23
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:28,564
2x21
~ 18-5-4 ~

24
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:38,903
You're all disguise, why?

25
00:02:39,128 --> 00:02:40,867
There was
this casting notice online.

26
00:02:40,992 --> 00:02:44,413
Said they were holding auditions today
for a circus movie.

27
00:02:45,016 --> 00:02:47,750
They were looking clown,
specified we should come in costume.

28
00:02:48,214 --> 00:02:50,336
Was there a name on the ad?
Contact information?

29
00:02:50,557 --> 00:02:53,464
No, just the address and time.
What's your name again?

30
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:56,025
Well, Miss Van P...

31
00:02:56,985 --> 00:02:58,052
What's this?

32
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,679
You've got my heart in your pocket.

33
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,950
Thanks for your time.

34
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,587
- I hate clowns.
- Get in line. Same story?

35
00:03:09,172 --> 00:03:10,689
They were here for an audition.

36
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,883
Keep up the interviews. Get a solid ID
on every one of these guys,

37
00:03:14,008 --> 00:03:16,862
and go back to the office
and see if you can trace placed the ad.

38
00:03:18,695 --> 00:03:19,490
You.

39
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,663
- Where have you been?
- Farmers' market.

40
00:03:26,387 --> 00:03:28,758
Delicious apples,
if you like that kind of thing.

41
00:03:29,162 --> 00:03:30,209
Keeping the clowns?

42
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,461
I don't want
that the shooter slipping away.

43
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:35,756
Too late. He's slipped.
These ones are just a smoke screen.

44
00:03:36,044 --> 00:03:37,550
Why else would he place the ad?

45
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,969
It's a lovely day,
to waste your time here.

46
00:03:40,223 --> 00:03:42,704
We have to.
Maybe Bozo made a mistake

47
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:44,568
and got caught here
with the rest of'em.

48
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,391
I knew a clown once.

49
00:03:46,516 --> 00:03:48,486
Catastropho was his name.
A card thrower.

50
00:03:49,555 --> 00:03:52,481
He could stick the ace of clubs
into a melon at 50 feet.

51
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,733
- We need to talk to the vic's wife.
- 50 feet.

52
00:03:58,819 --> 00:03:59,822
<i>If the...</i>

53
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:03,415
<i>If the zeta-function is defined
for all complex numbers</i>

54
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,921
<i>where</i> S <i>does not equal 1,</i>

55
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:07,718
- <i>then we can...</i>
- <i>To your audience.</i>

56
00:04:07,843 --> 00:04:09,415
<i>Look at me. Talk to me.</i>

57
00:04:11,932 --> 00:04:13,995
<i>I know you're just trying
to help, Daph.</i>

58
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,977
<i>Tell me more
about the zeta-whatever.</i>

59
00:04:16,102 --> 00:04:18,056
- <i>You can do it.</i>
- <i>I'm not cut out for this.</i>

60
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,405
<i>- You're doing fine.
- I'm sorry.</i>

61
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:26,515
We made this about two year ago
just before we got married.

62
00:04:26,762 --> 00:04:29,018
Noah was trying
to get a tenured teaching position.

63
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:30,477
How'd that work out?

64
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:31,745
Not so good.

65
00:04:32,367 --> 00:04:33,814
He has trouble addressing crowds.

66
00:04:34,297 --> 00:04:35,774
My brother was,

67
00:04:36,483 --> 00:04:38,083
a mathematical genius.

68
00:04:39,486 --> 00:04:40,863
He finished high school at 15,

69
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,121
got his first degree in, like...

70
00:04:44,245 --> 00:04:45,245
two years.

71
00:04:45,837 --> 00:04:47,536
But he wasn't good with people.

72
00:04:47,814 --> 00:04:49,038
He was good with me.

73
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:50,497
"Selected issues

74
00:04:51,055 --> 00:04:52,800
"in the fourth order

75
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:54,627
"differential equations."

76
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,059
I guess that was Noah's.

77
00:04:59,455 --> 00:05:01,039
<i>Love's Tender Passion.</i>

78
00:05:01,488 --> 00:05:02,488
Yours?

79
00:05:03,552 --> 00:05:04,762
Go ahead and make fun.

80
00:05:04,936 --> 00:05:06,180
I wouldn't dream of it.

81
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:07,548
No, it's okay.

82
00:05:08,355 --> 00:05:10,405
I get it.
I know how it looks.

83
00:05:10,976 --> 00:05:12,276
I'm no brainiac.

84
00:05:12,776 --> 00:05:15,314
If you met him, you'd probably think
he was king of the geeks.

85
00:05:16,063 --> 00:05:18,567
What can I say?
I always had a thing for the smart guys.

86
00:05:19,614 --> 00:05:21,612
My girlfriends thought I was crazy.

87
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,615
But when he opened up,

88
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:26,200
Noah had a beautiful soul.

89
00:05:27,444 --> 00:05:30,371
I was good for him.
I helped him with the world.

90
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,439
What did he do for a living?

91
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,808
He published a few papers
in mathematical journals,

92
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:38,530
which...

93
00:05:39,026 --> 00:05:40,881
obviously, do not pay much.

94
00:05:41,137 --> 00:05:42,887
But he was gonna do fine.

95
00:05:44,781 --> 00:05:47,121
He was always discovering...

96
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,181
What do you call 'em?
Proofs.

97
00:05:49,943 --> 00:05:51,493
And, inventing stuff.

98
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:55,204
But one day it would've paid off.
I know it would.

99
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,772
And in the meantime?

100
00:05:58,082 --> 00:06:00,582
We pretty much lived
on my waitressing.

101
00:06:01,614 --> 00:06:02,987
I think that bothered Noah,

102
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:05,855
because he said,
he wanted to help out more.

103
00:06:07,764 --> 00:06:10,386
He started day-trading
a few months back,

104
00:06:11,073 --> 00:06:13,080
- but don't think it went so well.
- Why is that?

105
00:06:13,764 --> 00:06:14,873
I don't know.

106
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,474
He wouldn't talk about it.

107
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:18,649
He never talked about anything.

108
00:06:19,405 --> 00:06:21,505
Where was he going this morning?

109
00:06:23,431 --> 00:06:25,636
A coffee place downtown.
Ariel's.

110
00:06:26,534 --> 00:06:28,345
He spent most days there
on his laptop,

111
00:06:30,163 --> 00:06:31,724
doing his day-trading stuff.

112
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,435
- He liked the background frequency.
- What's going on?

113
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:38,313
You couldn't sit down.
Guilty conscience?

114
00:06:42,453 --> 00:06:44,353
My little brother just died.

115
00:06:45,234 --> 00:06:47,114
And he was terrified of clowns,

116
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:49,324
- so whoever did this was sick.
- Did you know

117
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,451
about his thing

118
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:51,565
with clowns?

119
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,787
Yeah, Noah had his quirks.

120
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:57,230
And for the record,
where were you this morning

121
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,613
- at 7:30?
- I was here, asleep.

122
00:06:59,738 --> 00:07:02,254
- I worked a late shift last night.
- And you?

123
00:07:03,627 --> 00:07:04,627
In my car,

124
00:07:05,385 --> 00:07:06,508
on the way to work.

125
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,726
Tough game Noah had going here.

126
00:07:09,705 --> 00:07:11,472
He wasn't playing either of you?

127
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,967
- Who did he play with?
- Mostly one guy.

128
00:07:15,248 --> 00:07:16,498
Tolman Bunting.

129
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,788
He runs a store, <i>The Puzzle Nook</i>
not too far from the Valiquette.

130
00:07:20,913 --> 00:07:23,233
There's a lot of calls
between the store and the house.

131
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,987
We'll go and talk to him.
How's it going with the clowns?

132
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:29,683
<i>Kenmore P.D. found a clown's outfit
about 3 miles from the crime scene.</i>

133
00:07:29,808 --> 00:07:33,115
- <i>No trace of DNA.</i>
- We'll put the clowns aside for now,

134
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,412
but keep the files nearby,
in case of.

135
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,001
Okay, boss.
You got it.

136
00:07:40,292 --> 00:07:41,460
Noah's mind

137
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:43,037
was exquisite.

138
00:07:43,592 --> 00:07:46,402
A few years ago,
I published a book of number puzzles,

139
00:07:46,527 --> 00:07:48,634
and, shortly after,
Noah e-mailed me.

140
00:07:49,267 --> 00:07:51,065
He'd solved all the puzzles,
of course,

141
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:54,139
but he had also found
a few logical flaws in two of them.

142
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,642
That's when I realized
that I had to have a person

143
00:07:56,816 --> 00:07:59,559
of his intellectual caliber
in my orbit.

144
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,856
Then we started playing
a regular game of chess.

145
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,710
How often did you see him?

146
00:08:05,307 --> 00:08:07,820
Once a month, i'd say, but...

147
00:08:08,042 --> 00:08:10,792
We'd play on the internet
or on the phone...

148
00:08:11,921 --> 00:08:13,271
I think you'll...

149
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,369
You'll like that one.
It's rather tricky.

150
00:08:15,852 --> 00:08:17,704
Doesn't this just kinda go
like that...

151
00:08:18,361 --> 00:08:19,957
Around there.
That goes around there.

152
00:08:20,363 --> 00:08:21,794
Over there like that,

153
00:08:23,343 --> 00:08:24,253
That's it?

154
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,005
Very good.

155
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,843
That was fun.

156
00:08:31,348 --> 00:08:32,719
Do you know anybody

157
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,425
who was angry with Noah

158
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,808
or maybe somebody
who's held a grudge up against him?

159
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,748
Not at all, but, see,

160
00:08:39,036 --> 00:08:41,395
Noah was a bit oblivious
to people's feelings,

161
00:08:41,823 --> 00:08:44,441
so sometimes
that would come across as rude.

162
00:08:44,713 --> 00:08:45,977
But he's honestly

163
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:48,444
the gentlest person
that you can imagine.

164
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:49,820
I can't fathom

165
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,530
anyone wanting to kill Noah.

166
00:08:52,025 --> 00:08:54,366
Were you aware
that he was clourophobic? That means

167
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,846
- that he was afraid of...
- Fear of clowns.

168
00:08:58,363 --> 00:08:59,955
- You sure?
- Quite.

169
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:03,458
- Where were you this morning at 7:30?
- I was out for a run.

170
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:09,131
- Was this the game with Noah?
- As a matter of fact, it was.

171
00:09:11,835 --> 00:09:13,051
He might have had you.

172
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:14,219
You play?

173
00:09:15,178 --> 00:09:15,971
A little.

174
00:09:16,385 --> 00:09:17,890
We should have a game sometime.

175
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,057
That works.

176
00:09:19,182 --> 00:09:21,643
I'll open with pawn to C4.

177
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:25,397
Pawn to E6.

178
00:09:25,683 --> 00:09:26,607
Knight to F3.

179
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:27,733
Pawn to D5.

180
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,016
Declining the gambit.
Interesting.

181
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:31,883
Pawn to D4.

182
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,281
- Really?
- Scout's honor.

183
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:35,782
Could we continue,

184
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,148
- please?
- Of course.

185
00:09:37,273 --> 00:09:39,411
My apologies.
You're gonna regret that open.

186
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,133
- We'll see.
- Did you see anything

187
00:09:41,258 --> 00:09:42,915
unusual in Noah's behavior recently?

188
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,584
There was one thing.

189
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,863
When we actually started that game,

190
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:52,674
Noah was quite intent on betting,

191
00:09:53,929 --> 00:09:56,303
- which he had never done before.
- Did you take the bet?

192
00:09:56,608 --> 00:09:58,555
No, I like my money too much.

193
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,849
- You're sticking with that open?
- Why not?

194
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,852
Knight to F6.

195
00:10:04,093 --> 00:10:05,103
Knight to C3.

196
00:10:05,393 --> 00:10:06,393
Bishop...

197
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:08,607
to E7.

198
00:10:08,836 --> 00:10:10,484
Your funeral.

199
00:10:10,734 --> 00:10:12,024
Thank you for your time.

200
00:10:13,819 --> 00:10:15,072
Thank you for stopping by.

201
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,251
By the way,

202
00:10:16,634 --> 00:10:18,116
bishop... G5.

203
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:20,694
Mind your queen.

204
00:10:25,317 --> 00:10:27,209
You got a message
from somebody named Tolman.

205
00:10:28,218 --> 00:10:29,610
"King side castle."

206
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:35,305
As he leans toward his doom.

207
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:37,878
Chess, the game of kings.

208
00:10:38,003 --> 00:10:39,739
Kings with too much time
on their hands.

209
00:10:39,864 --> 00:10:40,806
Hey, boss?

210
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:41,760
What's up?

211
00:10:41,885 --> 00:10:44,066
Valiquette's wife
said that he was bringing in money

212
00:10:44,191 --> 00:10:45,477
- by day-trading?
- Yes.

213
00:10:46,732 --> 00:10:49,690
They had a little money in the bank,
I checked his web browser history.

214
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:52,150
There isn't a single trade, so...

215
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,152
I ran his social,
he's never owned a stock.

216
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,275
- What was he doing then?
- I can't tell.

217
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,227
There's a lot of files that seem like
random numbers and letters.

218
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:04,413
Every week, he e-mailed a bunch of them
to the same address, "Beastslayer 949".

219
00:11:04,648 --> 00:11:05,857
Contact Noah's ISP.

220
00:11:05,982 --> 00:11:08,208
Make them tell you
who beastslayer is.

221
00:11:08,557 --> 00:11:10,168
Daphne Valiquette on 2.

222
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,670
She sounds freaked.

223
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,551
<i>You have to come.
There's somebody inside my house.</i>

224
00:11:18,984 --> 00:11:20,889
I called as soon as I saw the door.

225
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,432
- It's all right.
- I was gone less than an hour.

226
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:26,226
I should've called the police.
I wasn't thinking.

227
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,467
- How many entrances?
- Just the back door.

228
00:11:28,592 --> 00:11:30,480
- Got it.
- You guys take the front.

229
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:34,963
Somebody forced it open.

230
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:46,734
Kitchen's clear.

231
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:49,869
Bathroom's clear!

232
00:11:50,178 --> 00:11:51,554
Living room's clear.

233
00:11:52,877 --> 00:11:53,837
Bedroom's clear.

234
00:11:55,244 --> 00:11:56,417
You need to see this.

235
00:12:05,912 --> 00:12:08,061
Somebody really wanted something.

236
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:10,312
Safe in the floor.
That's pretty old-school.

237
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,438
A high-end sensor lock.

238
00:12:13,563 --> 00:12:14,930
Tough to bust into.

239
00:12:15,055 --> 00:12:17,450
I'll call tech services,
we need a locksmith.

240
00:12:17,575 --> 00:12:18,570
Don't bother.

241
00:12:20,677 --> 00:12:21,948
I found the key.

242
00:12:22,646 --> 00:12:24,326
No, this type of safe
doesn't use a key.

243
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:25,753
Yes, it does.

244
00:12:33,262 --> 00:12:34,294
Bag it.

245
00:12:59,051 --> 00:13:01,099
You're telling me
that somebody killed my husband,

246
00:13:01,224 --> 00:13:03,115
cut off his finger
to get into some safe?

247
00:13:03,584 --> 00:13:05,450
Yes, and this is all
we found in there...

248
00:13:06,154 --> 00:13:07,536
A chessboard, a comic book

249
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:10,131
and some papers.
Have you ever seen this stuff before?

250
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:14,051
- Did Noah ever mention the safe?
- No. Never.

251
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,067
This was his house
before we got married.

252
00:13:17,192 --> 00:13:18,938
I just moved my stuff in.

253
00:13:19,968 --> 00:13:22,592
You can tell volunteering
information wasn't Noah's strong suit.

254
00:13:23,284 --> 00:13:25,974
We think whatever the killer
was looking for wasn't in the safe.

255
00:13:26,099 --> 00:13:28,433
That's why they ripped up
the rest of the house.

256
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:29,835
Would you excuse me?

257
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,727
Cho got in touch
with Valiquette's ISP.

258
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:13,477
"Beastslayer 949"

259
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:15,853
is Alec Mosca.
He lives 15 miles away.

260
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,635
- Cho and Rigsby are on their way now.
- Splendid.

261
00:14:18,995 --> 00:14:21,109
Did Noah have
any other hiding places?

262
00:14:21,935 --> 00:14:24,216
Maybe. Yeah, sure.
I don't know.

263
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,114
I don't know anything anymore.

264
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,535
How many secrets did he keep?
Why put all this junk into a safe?

265
00:14:30,855 --> 00:14:32,162
It's not all junk.

266
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,198
This is a <i>Spider-man</i> 46.

267
00:14:34,323 --> 00:14:36,458
In this issue,
he takes on the shocker.

268
00:14:36,873 --> 00:14:37,667
Very good.

269
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,085
Worth a pretty penny.

270
00:14:40,395 --> 00:14:41,213
What I find

271
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:42,477
is interesting,

272
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:44,815
is that the chess set

273
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,512
that your husband has set up
on the table is expensive,

274
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,610
and this one, on the other hand,
is made in China...

275
00:14:51,999 --> 00:14:53,058
Not so expensive.

276
00:14:54,007 --> 00:14:56,019
So one has to wonder why

277
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:58,928
he had the cheapo set
hidden away so carefully,

278
00:14:59,053 --> 00:15:00,152
unless...

279
00:15:06,374 --> 00:15:08,031
there's something inside.

280
00:15:12,487 --> 00:15:13,537
Locker key.

281
00:15:13,743 --> 00:15:14,868
Locker 42.

282
00:15:15,183 --> 00:15:16,540
I wonder where that is.

283
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,254
It's this one?

284
00:15:28,049 --> 00:15:29,099
Alec Mosca?

285
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:31,096
Who are you?

286
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,306
Agents Cho and Rigsby, CBI.

287
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,058
- Please open the door.
- Who?

288
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:36,476
CBI, sir. Let us in.

289
00:15:37,195 --> 00:15:39,373
Sure. CBI, no problem.

290
00:15:39,597 --> 00:15:40,814
Look, I'm in my skivvies,

291
00:15:41,151 --> 00:15:42,232
so, give me a second

292
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,567
to get presentable.

293
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:47,078
He's gonna put his pants on
before he hits the window?

294
00:15:47,203 --> 00:15:48,238
No, I do not.

295
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,080
Let me see your hands!

296
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:59,273
- Get away from here!
- Let me see your hands!

297
00:15:59,398 --> 00:16:00,595
No problem.

298
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:03,044
There's $14,000 in it.
Take that to Mike.

299
00:16:03,284 --> 00:16:04,671
Tell him I'm good for the rest.

300
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,590
On my sister-in-law's grave,
I swear!

301
00:16:06,823 --> 00:16:07,924
What the hell...

302
00:16:08,528 --> 00:16:10,260
Mike sent you, right?
To collect

303
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:11,886
on the boston-philly bet?

304
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,347
Crap.

305
00:16:15,673 --> 00:16:16,641
Face the wall.

306
00:16:17,092 --> 00:16:18,393
Put your hands on your head.

307
00:16:21,843 --> 00:16:22,981
Who are you guys?

308
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,316
Remember the badge?

309
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:25,356
CBI.

310
00:16:25,481 --> 00:16:27,736
- What is that?
- California Bureau of Investigation.

311
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:29,561
- What is that?
- We're like the FBI,

312
00:16:29,686 --> 00:16:31,551
only more conveniently located.

313
00:16:38,305 --> 00:16:39,322
Let me say

314
00:16:39,745 --> 00:16:40,915
I'm very sorry

315
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,213
for the misunderstanding at my door.

316
00:16:43,338 --> 00:16:44,794
I had no idea you were cops.

317
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,796
We showed you our badges.

318
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,466
Never watch movies?
That's how the bad guys do it.

319
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:50,967
No, it's not. Sit down.

320
00:16:57,258 --> 00:16:59,179
How do you know Noah Valiquette?

321
00:16:59,304 --> 00:17:00,226
Coffeehouse.

322
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:03,540
Noah likes vienna roast.
I'm partial to the sumatran blend.

323
00:17:04,206 --> 00:17:05,898
Is that
what he's e-mailing you about...

324
00:17:06,023 --> 00:17:07,274
Coffee orders?

325
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,905
You should tell the truth.
Easier to remember.

326
00:17:13,394 --> 00:17:14,449
This is how it is.

327
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:17,037
I occasionally place a wager.

328
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,880
- Meaning you're a degenerate gambler?
- Yeah, okay.

329
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,280
A couple months back, I'm in
the coffeehouse going through my picks

330
00:17:23,405 --> 00:17:26,386
when Noah asks what I'm doing.
Long story short,

331
00:17:26,658 --> 00:17:29,297
he says he can give me
"rational analysis" on the ***

332
00:17:29,702 --> 00:17:30,840
so I threw him

333
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,359
a couple games.

334
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:33,760
They all came through.

335
00:17:34,121 --> 00:17:35,841
That caught my eye,
so we made a deal.

336
00:17:35,966 --> 00:17:38,431
He gave me picks.
I gave him 10% of the winnings.

337
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,599
Picks, huh?

338
00:17:39,819 --> 00:17:43,103
Noah said he had to send them in code.
Don't ask me. Just who he was.

339
00:17:45,177 --> 00:17:46,690
When did the arrangement go south?

340
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:48,817
- It did?
- You did. You've been nervous

341
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:51,674
- since I mentioned him.
- From three weeks back,

342
00:17:52,088 --> 00:17:54,178
every one of Noah's calls is a bust.

343
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,633
Guy couldn't pick a bear to crap
in the woods. I asked what was going on.

344
00:17:57,894 --> 00:17:59,494
All he'd say was he had a problem,

345
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,496
- couldn't focus.
- Must've made you angry.

346
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:03,387
You think? He's got a problem?

347
00:18:03,512 --> 00:18:05,125
I'm the one bleeding money.

348
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:07,776
But anything
that you might have heard

349
00:18:07,901 --> 00:18:09,706
about angry words between us

350
00:18:09,831 --> 00:18:11,548
bears no relation
to deeds carried out.

351
00:18:11,861 --> 00:18:13,049
I never touched the guy.

352
00:18:13,982 --> 00:18:15,176
Mosca's got two arrests

353
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,224
for assault.
I could see him going after Noah.

354
00:18:17,349 --> 00:18:19,744
In a bar fight, maybe.
Not in a clown suit.

355
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,350
The question is,

356
00:18:21,904 --> 00:18:25,145
- why did Noah's picks go sour?
- Anybody can have a bad run.

357
00:18:25,749 --> 00:18:27,627
But Noah wasn't anybody,

358
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,442
a day here, a day there.
But three weeks?

359
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,987
According to Mosca, he had a problem.
He couldn't focus. Troubles at home?

360
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:36,102
Doesn't sound like problem
he'd even notice.

361
00:18:36,227 --> 00:18:38,658
It must have been some kind of
intellectual challenge.

362
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:42,096
Agreed. But who could present that kind
of intellectual challenge, that kind...

363
00:18:42,851 --> 00:18:43,851
of puzzle?

364
00:18:48,028 --> 00:18:49,669
Did you come here
to concede the game?

365
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:50,976
Not at all.

366
00:18:52,552 --> 00:18:54,116
Bishop takes E7.

367
00:18:55,577 --> 00:18:56,468
Interesting.

368
00:18:56,953 --> 00:18:57,802
What problem

369
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,596
was Noah working on for you?

370
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:02,515
I don't know what you're talking about.
Noah and I played chess.

371
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:03,349
Liar.

372
00:19:03,744 --> 00:19:05,469
I am not a liar.

373
00:19:05,594 --> 00:19:07,645
What makes you think
I can't tell that?

374
00:19:09,377 --> 00:19:12,400
Enough, Mr. Tolman. Start talking
the truth or I'm gonna pop ya.

375
00:19:12,696 --> 00:19:14,837
- Don't even think about it.
- Put the gun down.

376
00:19:14,962 --> 00:19:15,779
Down.

377
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,616
It's soft. It's just a hand.

378
00:19:19,861 --> 00:19:21,402
There's nothing there.

379
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:22,590
Just a hand.

380
00:19:22,715 --> 00:19:23,703
We're good.

381
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:24,871
Annika,

382
00:19:25,184 --> 00:19:26,439
put the gun down.

383
00:19:28,636 --> 00:19:30,168
Why do you have an armed bodyguard?

384
00:19:32,352 --> 00:19:34,574
Why don't we, step into my office?

385
00:19:40,926 --> 00:19:41,814
Sweet.

386
00:19:41,939 --> 00:19:43,788
Do you understand how important

387
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:46,256
puzzles and codes are to you agents?

388
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,193
They protect your e-mails.

389
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,021
They stop credit card fraud.

390
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:53,107
Puzzle making and breaking
is the preeminent security issue

391
00:19:53,499 --> 00:19:54,943
of our day, and I run

392
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:57,896
a consulting firm that deals
specifically with those issues.

393
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,823
Who do you work for?

394
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:01,241
We're not prejudiced.

395
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:03,576
- Whoever needs us.
- What was Noah doing for you?

396
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:04,945
That's delicate.

397
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,247
Mr. Bunting, unless you give us

398
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:09,082
your full cooperation,

399
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,918
I'll have the CBI computer crimes unit
in this office

400
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:13,100
in an hour.

401
00:20:14,898 --> 00:20:18,091
I was grooming Noah
for a, pet project...

402
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:19,659
Something special.

403
00:20:20,456 --> 00:20:21,469
What for?

404
00:20:23,976 --> 00:20:26,153
A device that could decipher

405
00:20:26,278 --> 00:20:28,172
virtually any encrypted information.

406
00:20:28,418 --> 00:20:29,821
The universal hack.

407
00:20:29,946 --> 00:20:32,053
That's the crude way of calling it.

408
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:35,179
I identified three people
that I thought could pull it off,

409
00:20:35,304 --> 00:20:38,778
Noah was one of them.
I offered each one of them $2 million.

410
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:42,246
Last week,
Noah called me and told me

411
00:20:42,371 --> 00:20:44,163
that he had built the device

412
00:20:44,529 --> 00:20:47,161
but that he wasn't
going to give it to me.

413
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,146
Why?

414
00:20:48,271 --> 00:20:49,779
He said he had second thoughts.

415
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,041
He was worried about the device
falling

416
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:54,460
- into the wrong hands.
- That doesn't worry you?

417
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:56,504
I'm a businessman, not a moralist.

418
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,668
Kind of annoying, though,

419
00:20:58,793 --> 00:21:01,634
- Noah holding out on you like that.
- Not really.

420
00:21:02,508 --> 00:21:05,959
You see, I decided that Noah
didn't really build the device,

421
00:21:06,084 --> 00:21:08,182
that he couldn't,
embarrassed by his failures.

422
00:21:08,586 --> 00:21:11,728
What if he had built a device?
What you'd do to get your hands on it?

423
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:13,055
Anything...

424
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,643
Short of killing him, of course.

425
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,651
I found a locker key
at Noah's house, very well hidden.

426
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,311
A locker 42.

427
00:21:20,598 --> 00:21:22,655
Interesting.
Any idea where that locker is?

428
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:24,532
- We're looking.
- If you find it,

429
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,186
you must let me know,

430
00:21:26,624 --> 00:21:28,818
because that device is mine.

431
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:31,664
Not yet.
You haven't paid for it.

432
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:34,100
I have a handful of lawyers
looking into it.

433
00:21:36,524 --> 00:21:37,721
Before I forget...

434
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:39,255
queen to E7.

435
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,561
Taking your bishop.

436
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:46,137
We need to talk to the people
you're working on this project with.

437
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,645
Fine. No problem.

438
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:49,766
There's an Alex Kromm
who lives in Amsterdam,

439
00:21:49,935 --> 00:21:53,898
and then the third person is local...
a Oliver McDaniel.

440
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,065
But I doubt that he killed Noah.

441
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,316
Why?

442
00:22:27,871 --> 00:22:29,744
Oliver Simon McDaniel.

443
00:22:30,269 --> 00:22:33,418
Your file says that
you finished college at 16,

444
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,733
graduate school at 19, and...

445
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:39,107
you were sent here after nearly choking
your father to death.

446
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:40,840
He's not my father.

447
00:22:40,965 --> 00:22:43,736
He's a cyber clone sent by
the galactic quantum lords.

448
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:47,447
Them. You know, they're
always up to something shady.

449
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:50,436
Yes. They're trying to drive me mad.

450
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,078
But they won't succeed.

451
00:22:54,031 --> 00:22:55,498
Have you heard about Noah?

452
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:56,666
I did.

453
00:22:56,895 --> 00:22:59,252
Sad. Can you do a shiatsu massage?

454
00:23:01,158 --> 00:23:03,451
Shame. I'm tight.
So tight.

455
00:23:03,576 --> 00:23:06,844
And my skin is
just so dry and flaky.

456
00:23:08,675 --> 00:23:11,094
The visitor log says that
Noah was the only person

457
00:23:11,219 --> 00:23:13,132
who came to see you.
How did you know him?

458
00:23:13,639 --> 00:23:15,851
Grad school.
I felt sorry for him.

459
00:23:16,415 --> 00:23:17,817
He was a little off.

460
00:23:18,135 --> 00:23:21,149
My guess was radiation.
How did he die?

461
00:23:21,654 --> 00:23:22,775
Gunshot wound,

462
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:25,695
which, suggests it wasn't
the quantum lords that killed him.

463
00:23:26,091 --> 00:23:28,322
Duh.
They'd use a lorax beam.

464
00:23:29,607 --> 00:23:32,038
Why would they want
to kill Noah anyway? Big wuss.

465
00:23:32,163 --> 00:23:34,614
Quite. His killer
wore a clown costume.

466
00:23:34,739 --> 00:23:36,624
Any ideas who that might have been?

467
00:23:36,986 --> 00:23:40,293
Assuming, of course, that it
is a carbon-based life-form.

468
00:23:41,396 --> 00:23:43,001
But the clown thing's clever.

469
00:23:43,482 --> 00:23:44,899
Noah hated them.

470
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:48,775
We understand that youere working
on a problem for Tolman Bunting?

471
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:51,512
My doctors wanted to nix it,
but I convinced them

472
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,473
it was good therapy.
Don't touch that!

473
00:24:00,158 --> 00:24:03,649
Did you know that Noah
was working on one for him, too?

474
00:24:04,062 --> 00:24:06,362
Which makes him a big-ass hypocrite.

475
00:24:08,429 --> 00:24:09,529
Why is that?

476
00:24:10,126 --> 00:24:11,898
Back in grad school, we got offered

477
00:24:12,023 --> 00:24:14,146
a gig writing code
for some defense contractor.

478
00:24:14,271 --> 00:24:17,676
Noah passed. Said he didn't want
to do anything that could harm someone.

479
00:24:17,801 --> 00:24:20,183
Like this thing for Tolman
is any better!

480
00:24:20,308 --> 00:24:21,390
It's worse.

481
00:24:21,853 --> 00:24:24,861
You could destroy the world,
practically, if you wanted to.

482
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,062
Noah may well have
completed that project.

483
00:24:29,187 --> 00:24:31,007
How are you doing with it?

484
00:24:31,861 --> 00:24:32,678
Fine.

485
00:24:33,506 --> 00:24:34,906
So not even close.

486
00:24:37,355 --> 00:24:39,685
I could gouge your eyes out
with a spoon.

487
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,516
I'll take a rain check on that.

488
00:24:41,641 --> 00:24:45,000
It appears Noah may have
hidden the device in a locker

489
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,584
that this key belongs to.

490
00:24:47,874 --> 00:24:51,114
Do you have any idea
where that locker could be?

491
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:53,648
Sir, I'm a mental patient.

492
00:24:53,773 --> 00:24:56,068
I don't know anything.
Nobody does.

493
00:24:56,193 --> 00:24:58,625
But see, I know I don't know.

494
00:24:59,069 --> 00:25:00,069
Paradox.

495
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:02,792
Interview over.

496
00:25:03,233 --> 00:25:04,303
Yes, it is.

497
00:25:06,426 --> 00:25:07,426
Thank you.

498
00:25:08,459 --> 00:25:10,598
It's funny how well
you two get along.

499
00:25:11,129 --> 00:25:12,889
I have the same kind of trouble

500
00:25:13,014 --> 00:25:14,720
with those pesky quantum lords.

501
00:25:15,277 --> 00:25:17,098
Noah's ethics should've
prevented him

502
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:19,712
from taking on the project
but he took it on.

503
00:25:19,837 --> 00:25:21,438
- Why?
- Noah loved puzzles,

504
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:23,290
he couldn't resist the challenge.

505
00:25:23,415 --> 00:25:26,055
- Plenty of those to choose from.
- Thanks.

506
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,870
The prospect
of lots and lots of money?

507
00:25:29,642 --> 00:25:32,321
- That's a boring motive.
- It's still pretty popular.

508
00:25:34,945 --> 00:25:36,232
<i>Inmate escape.</i>

509
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:37,848
Open that now!

510
00:25:40,595 --> 00:25:42,778
<i>I repeat, an inmate escape.</i>

511
00:25:45,282 --> 00:25:47,299
Alert the quantum lords.

512
00:25:52,746 --> 00:25:54,804
Have the Kenmore police
put out an APB

513
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:57,513
and get me everything you can
on Oliver McDaniel.

514
00:25:58,273 --> 00:25:59,418
I'm impressed.

515
00:25:59,543 --> 00:26:02,727
Oliver made his own key pass
using information stolen from one guard,

516
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:05,938
trips the alarm to create a distraction,
a hides in the guards locker room.

517
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,970
- Last place they'd search.
- Turns out

518
00:26:08,095 --> 00:26:11,468
it's not the first time. Multiple exits
for stretching back more than a month.

519
00:26:11,593 --> 00:26:13,196
Hospital security didn't flag this?

520
00:26:13,364 --> 00:26:16,407
Exits came up under the guard's name.
Nothing out of the ordinary.

521
00:26:16,726 --> 00:26:18,576
Oliver could come
whenever he wanted.

522
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:21,204
But he was gone for
4 hours at the time of Noah's murder.

523
00:26:21,372 --> 00:26:23,523
- Bumps him up the suspect list.
- One thing.

524
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:26,125
Why now? Why not stick to routine
and slip out at night?

525
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:28,158
Because he was going
after the device.

526
00:26:28,283 --> 00:26:30,341
He must have figured out
where it was when he saw

527
00:26:30,466 --> 00:26:32,256
the key, would've done
anything to get it.

528
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:35,468
- You talk to Tolman Bunting?
- He had no idea where Oliver could be.

529
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:37,956
If Oliver leaves a trail,
it's not gonna be his.

530
00:26:38,081 --> 00:26:40,197
Check the guard's name
and run his credit cards.

531
00:26:40,322 --> 00:26:42,621
Security pass may not be
the only thing Oliver copied.

532
00:26:42,746 --> 00:26:43,935
Okay, you got it.

533
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:50,186
If I wanted to go away by the ocean,

534
00:26:50,311 --> 00:26:51,676
you know, somewhere close,

535
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:55,321
- kind of a resort-type thing...
- Spa treatments?

536
00:26:56,976 --> 00:26:58,627
That kind of thing, exactly.

537
00:26:59,288 --> 00:27:01,073
That's what I'm talkin' about.

538
00:27:01,713 --> 00:27:03,496
Is there any places you'd recommend?

539
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:05,331
I'm kind of busy here, Jane.

540
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:07,167
Can you look on your computer?

541
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,472
- It'll take ten seconds.
- Why don't you do it?

542
00:27:09,597 --> 00:27:11,128
I'll get you a nougat bar

543
00:27:11,462 --> 00:27:12,950
from the machine over there.

544
00:27:15,345 --> 00:27:16,742
Give me five minutes.

545
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:19,369
You are the queen
of my heart, Grace.

546
00:27:20,099 --> 00:27:20,930
I'll wait.

547
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:36,981
Welcome to Tidewater, sir.

548
00:27:37,106 --> 00:27:39,490
Thank you.
Very, lovely place.

549
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:42,493
We like to think so. Is there
something I can help you with?

550
00:27:43,479 --> 00:27:44,491
Yes, there is.

551
00:27:44,616 --> 00:27:46,914
How is your staff at procuring,

552
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:49,000
- things for guests?
- What do you mean?

553
00:27:49,225 --> 00:27:52,231
- You know, special things.
- If it's company you're looking for...

554
00:27:52,463 --> 00:27:55,600
No, it's... it's not
company I'm looking for.

555
00:27:56,426 --> 00:27:59,389
But thank you,
if you're offering company...

556
00:27:59,881 --> 00:28:00,881
Gary.

557
00:28:04,791 --> 00:28:06,525
Got a hit
on the guard's credit card.

558
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:09,891
Somebody used it to buy a ticket to
Brazil departing out of SFO in an hour.

559
00:28:10,016 --> 00:28:12,657
Tell the airport police
we're on our way.

560
00:28:19,967 --> 00:28:20,906
What, Jane?

561
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,617
- What's up, Lisbon?
- Nothing much. Might make a run

562
00:28:23,742 --> 00:28:26,533
to the San Francisco airport
to pick up Oliver McDaniel.

563
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,041
You may want to rethink that.

564
00:28:39,971 --> 00:28:41,071
Where is he?

565
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:43,309
Isn't this lovely?

566
00:28:44,114 --> 00:28:45,890
Smell of the ocean air,

567
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:47,665
sand beneath your feet.

568
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:50,186
We should move our offices here.

569
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:52,061
Oliver... Jane, where is he?

570
00:28:52,636 --> 00:28:55,630
You'd be so much happier...
do wonders for your stress levels.

571
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:57,699
He's ticketed on a flight to Brazil.

572
00:28:57,824 --> 00:28:59,904
Cho and Rigsby are on their way
to the airport.

573
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,909
Oliver has been in an insane
asylum for about six months.

574
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:05,682
He asked you for a massage.

575
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,577
He's in need of a little pampering.

576
00:29:09,145 --> 00:29:12,105
- The flight's a misdirect.
- How can you be so sure?

577
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:14,901
The sound machine in his bedroom
was tuned in to the ocean.

578
00:29:15,026 --> 00:29:18,387
That, and the fact that room 6-4-4

579
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:22,291
has already ordered six cans
of spaghettio's from the concierge.

580
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:24,826
- You can't arrest him yet.
- Yes, I can.

581
00:29:24,951 --> 00:29:27,084
No, you can't.
He escaped because he knows

582
00:29:27,209 --> 00:29:29,558
the location of the device,
and if we follow him,

583
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:32,061
- he'll lead us to it.
- I don't care about the device.

584
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:34,105
You don't care about
a code-breaking device

585
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:37,291
that could hack into our government's
national security system?

586
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,574
That's not very patriotic, Lisbon.

587
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,511
Pina Colada?

588
00:29:48,234 --> 00:29:50,243
Rook to b8?

589
00:29:51,037 --> 00:29:52,387
Poor, deluded fool.

590
00:29:55,017 --> 00:29:58,395
Bunting will be resigned
before lunch, the way he's playing.

591
00:29:58,677 --> 00:29:59,709
Great.

592
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:03,509
Bishop...

593
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:05,511
to

594
00:30:05,951 --> 00:30:06,951
C4.

595
00:30:09,306 --> 00:30:10,307
There he is.

596
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,895
Cho, we have a visual. We'll take point.
You and rigsby hang back.

597
00:30:35,856 --> 00:30:38,165
He's headed in now.
Let's see where he's going.

598
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,997
Who was that?

599
00:31:22,122 --> 00:31:24,465
- I don't know.
- Watch Oliver. Cho, come on.

600
00:31:28,165 --> 00:31:29,678
Need a paramedic at the pier.

601
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,563
CBI. Don't move!

602
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,048
42.

603
00:32:45,621 --> 00:32:46,629
Don't move!

604
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,508
Four and

605
00:32:53,953 --> 00:32:54,680
two.

606
00:33:09,384 --> 00:33:11,166
Nice work, tailing us to the pier.

607
00:33:11,291 --> 00:33:13,884
But I guess for a guy who's after
the universal hack,

608
00:33:14,009 --> 00:33:16,660
listening in on police radios
is no big thing.

609
00:33:17,436 --> 00:33:20,248
It was, an unseasonably warm day.

610
00:33:20,611 --> 00:33:23,096
I wanted to cool off by the water.
It was pure coincidence

611
00:33:23,221 --> 00:33:25,861
- that Drew me there.
- This isn't funny, Mr. Bunting.

612
00:33:27,087 --> 00:33:28,255
You're in trouble.

613
00:33:28,681 --> 00:33:30,007
We've got a big handful

614
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:32,931
of felonies for what you did today,
and we are this close

615
00:33:33,056 --> 00:33:35,262
to nailing you for the murder
of Noah Valiquette.

616
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,969
- Really?
- Really.

617
00:33:37,775 --> 00:33:39,622
The clown costume, the ad...

618
00:33:39,877 --> 00:33:42,561
sounds like the work of a man who likes
to play games, doesn't it?

619
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:46,106
AG on the phone, says it's urgent.

620
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:47,691
Do me a favor and,

621
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,451
send my best
to the attorney general.

622
00:33:51,316 --> 00:33:53,910
And tell Mr. Jane queen to D8.

623
00:33:54,528 --> 00:33:56,339
Queen to D8!

624
00:33:56,752 --> 00:33:57,785
Thank you.

625
00:34:01,597 --> 00:34:03,290
You knew where Noah hid the device.

626
00:34:03,595 --> 00:34:04,458
How?

627
00:34:04,949 --> 00:34:08,504
In grad school, Noah and I would go
to the pier. Noah liked the rides.

628
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:10,047
I liked the beach,

629
00:34:10,313 --> 00:34:12,463
all those young women
in wet bathing suits.

630
00:34:13,491 --> 00:34:15,969
I knew Noah hid the device there
as soon as I saw that key.

631
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,438
So you decided to escape
and get it for yourself.

632
00:34:18,563 --> 00:34:19,682
I wanted the money.

633
00:34:20,027 --> 00:34:21,978
There's an intergalactic war coming.

634
00:34:22,103 --> 00:34:23,275
Yes, I'm aware.

635
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:26,647
If you take the device,
you know we're waiting for you.

636
00:34:27,153 --> 00:34:29,829
I wanted the device
so I could see how it worked.

637
00:34:30,144 --> 00:34:32,913
After that, I could make my own,
sell 'em wherever,

638
00:34:33,169 --> 00:34:34,905
have enough money
to build my bunker.

639
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:38,158
The hospital security logs have you out
the morning of the murder.

640
00:34:38,283 --> 00:34:41,254
- War preparations?
- Breakfast at my favorite strip club.

641
00:34:41,527 --> 00:34:44,120
They have an open buffet,
all you can eat.

642
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:46,594
And Noah's killer planned
an elaborate diversion

643
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:49,503
to get away from the crime scene,
like your ticket to brazil stunt.

644
00:34:50,302 --> 00:34:53,441
I wasn't aware it was a crime
to be intelligent, agent Cho.

645
00:34:55,686 --> 00:34:58,804
The AG insists I let Bunting go,
drop all charges.

646
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:00,472
The man must have serious juice.

647
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,600
It stands to reason.
He knows where the skeletons are buried.

648
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,687
I don't know what to do.
How do you build the case?

649
00:35:09,001 --> 00:35:10,251
It's not so hard.

650
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,694
Talk to the girls at the strip club.

651
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:15,529
Someone's gotta remember.

652
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:17,141
He speaks the truth, Cho.

653
00:35:17,714 --> 00:35:20,448
Oliver here would have trouble killing
a light beer...

654
00:35:21,254 --> 00:35:23,661
- Much less Noah Valiquette.
- That's not accurate.

655
00:35:24,059 --> 00:35:25,914
I could mess you up badly
if I wanted to.

656
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:27,463
But you don't want to.

657
00:35:28,118 --> 00:35:30,627
Before we let you walk out the door,
I need a favor.

658
00:35:31,085 --> 00:35:32,604
- Not a chance.
- Consider it.

659
00:35:32,729 --> 00:35:34,840
It'll give you the chance
to work with this,

660
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:37,301
then when you're done,
a gift from the planetary league.

661
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,209
Rook takes F6.

662
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:49,563
Your very friendly assistant
let me in.

663
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,458
Rook takes F6.

664
00:35:53,428 --> 00:35:54,958
King to G8.

665
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,112
What you doing here?

666
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,041
I came by to see
if Noah's doohickey here

667
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:02,075
actually works.

668
00:36:02,732 --> 00:36:03,983
- That's it?
- Yes.

669
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:07,581
- So he did build it.
- Yes, and I'm here

670
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:09,000
Yto return it...

671
00:36:09,201 --> 00:36:11,084
For $2 million, of course.

672
00:36:12,368 --> 00:36:14,296
You expect me to pay you?

673
00:36:14,616 --> 00:36:16,924
Well, not me, no,
but its rightful owners.

674
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:18,449
Have you met

675
00:36:18,834 --> 00:36:21,470
Noah's wife daphne and brother Rafe?
Legally,

676
00:36:21,907 --> 00:36:24,501
Noah's property
is passed on to daphne,

677
00:36:24,626 --> 00:36:26,047
including this.

678
00:36:26,655 --> 00:36:28,310
You ever seen this before?

679
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:29,812
- No.
- What is it?

680
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:33,524
It's a code-breaking device
designed by Noah for Mr. Bunting,

681
00:36:34,574 --> 00:36:36,527
in return for $2 million...

682
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:37,778
Your $2 million.

683
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:38,676
My god.

684
00:36:38,801 --> 00:36:41,220
I'm sure a cashier's check will be fine,
Mr. Bunting. Yes.

685
00:36:41,345 --> 00:36:42,115
I think

686
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:45,452
we first have to make sure this works.
At was part of our arrangement.

687
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,898
As you wish.

688
00:36:57,774 --> 00:36:59,842
We're gonna need an encrypted file.

689
00:37:00,433 --> 00:37:02,719
How about
agent Lisbon's personnel file?

690
00:37:04,014 --> 00:37:06,932
I happen to have it on disk right here.
It has some great photos.

691
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:07,975
Fine.

692
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:18,542
It seems to be working here.

693
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:25,142
- What does that mean?
- It means

694
00:37:25,267 --> 00:37:26,994
that it's not working.

695
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:30,706
It seems Noah was unable
to complete the project.

696
00:37:31,097 --> 00:37:32,749
I am sorry, Mrs. Valiquette.

697
00:37:33,107 --> 00:37:34,509
He needed more time.

698
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,906
Wait. How do we know it doesn't work?
Maybe he's

699
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,674
playing us,
trying to save himself a couple million.

700
00:37:41,177 --> 00:37:43,427
Don't be absurd.
Why wouldn't I want this to work?

701
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:47,472
Try it again, 'cause my husband's
a genius. It has to work.

702
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,521
I'm afraid your,
husband's genius had its limitations.

703
00:37:50,646 --> 00:37:51,677
Humor us.

704
00:37:55,498 --> 00:37:56,498
Okay, fine.

705
00:38:06,804 --> 00:38:08,118
What's happening?

706
00:38:09,538 --> 00:38:10,579
It's working.

707
00:38:12,483 --> 00:38:13,569
It's working!

708
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:19,671
What the hell?

709
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,340
- Turn it off.
- Wait.

710
00:38:22,227 --> 00:38:24,217
- It's right, isn't it?
- Of course not.

711
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,850
You said you didn't know anything
about the device.

712
00:38:26,975 --> 00:38:28,135
You were lying.

713
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:32,173
I had Oliver change the settings
so it wouldn't work.

714
00:38:32,298 --> 00:38:35,646
But you knew how to change them back.
You watched Noah work.

715
00:38:36,742 --> 00:38:40,150
You knew that he decided not
to give it to Tolman for any price.

716
00:38:40,395 --> 00:38:43,070
So you did what you felt you had to...
You played on his fear.

717
00:38:43,386 --> 00:38:46,564
You'd take the device
and turn it in to Tolman yourself.

718
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:48,909
All you had to do was open the safe.

719
00:38:49,528 --> 00:38:50,719
The problem...

720
00:38:52,016 --> 00:38:53,554
it wasn't in the safe.

721
00:38:58,941 --> 00:39:00,105
That movie

722
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:03,388
with the crazy math guy
and the woman who loves him...

723
00:39:04,791 --> 00:39:07,291
Yeah, I thought Noah
and me would be like that.

724
00:39:10,433 --> 00:39:12,010
"Love's tender passion."

725
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,663
Yeah, you go ahead and make fun.

726
00:39:16,493 --> 00:39:18,689
Life with Noah
was nothing like that.

727
00:39:19,145 --> 00:39:20,273
It was silence...

728
00:39:20,606 --> 00:39:21,751
days of it,

729
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:25,455
and books I could never understand
the title of,

730
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:29,166
and no sex when he's thinking,
which, by the way, is all the time.

731
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:34,339
I work 50 hours a week scrounging
for tips just so we could have food.

732
00:39:37,657 --> 00:39:39,106
Anyway, so then

733
00:39:39,567 --> 00:39:41,888
Noah told me about this guy who would
pay him

734
00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:44,914
$2 million to build this thing...
$2 million.

735
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:48,969
I begged him,
and finally he said he would do it,

736
00:39:49,094 --> 00:39:51,563
which was only right
because it was his turn.

737
00:39:51,878 --> 00:39:53,479
But he wouldn't hand it over,

738
00:39:54,729 --> 00:39:56,559
and you couldn't live with that.

739
00:39:58,218 --> 00:40:00,205
He said it was too dangerous.

740
00:40:01,852 --> 00:40:03,278
I tried to make him,

741
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:04,921
but he said that...

742
00:40:05,961 --> 00:40:09,139
He said I wasn't able
to understand the implications.

743
00:40:11,347 --> 00:40:14,011
So I decided to show him
I could be smart, too.

744
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:18,778
Or a whole lot dumber.
I'm not sure which.

745
00:40:20,578 --> 00:40:21,578
Get up.

746
00:40:25,049 --> 00:40:26,556
Hands behind your back.

747
00:40:36,584 --> 00:40:37,869
What put you on to her?

748
00:40:37,994 --> 00:40:40,362
I came to it very late.
I could have kicked myself.

749
00:40:40,487 --> 00:40:43,832
The kitchen of her house was left
unsearched because that was her domain.

750
00:40:43,957 --> 00:40:45,888
She knew the device wasn't there.

751
00:40:49,693 --> 00:40:50,739
Perfect timing.

752
00:40:51,645 --> 00:40:52,645
Pawn

753
00:40:52,778 --> 00:40:53,778
to F

754
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:54,993
four.

755
00:41:01,336 --> 00:41:02,336
Shrewd.

756
00:41:04,374 --> 00:41:07,631
But I gather you're here
for more than just to pin my queen.

757
00:41:09,077 --> 00:41:11,577
Actually, I came here to collect

758
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:12,921
my property.

759
00:41:15,001 --> 00:41:18,100
Given daphne's condition,
ownership of the device

760
00:41:18,471 --> 00:41:19,893
goes to Noah's brother.

761
00:41:20,825 --> 00:41:23,302
But when I contacted rafe,
he wanted nothing to do with it.

762
00:41:23,641 --> 00:41:25,393
So according to my attorneys,

763
00:41:25,767 --> 00:41:27,812
that passes the device...

764
00:41:28,513 --> 00:41:29,513
to me.

765
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:33,598
I've all the documents.
If you have any questions...

766
00:41:33,723 --> 00:41:35,656
No need.
It's all yours.

767
00:41:38,208 --> 00:41:40,789
I hope you don't mind,
I did have a little fiddle with it.

768
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:42,788
I just wanted to see how it worked.

769
00:41:47,765 --> 00:41:50,090
- Easily fixed, I'd imagine.
- Easily?

770
00:41:51,445 --> 00:41:52,342
What's that?

771
00:41:52,836 --> 00:41:54,553
That may be part of it.

772
00:42:00,886 --> 00:42:03,305
You are gonna be hearing
from my attorney.

773
00:42:03,982 --> 00:42:05,501
Tolman, one last thing...

774
00:42:06,728 --> 00:42:07,732
Bishop...

775
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:10,825
to C4.

776
00:42:13,454 --> 00:42:14,482
Forced mate

777
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:16,158
in three moves.

778
00:42:18,474 --> 00:42:19,244
I win.

779
00:42:20,384 --> 00:42:22,148
Come and take a closer look.

780
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:23,492
You'll see it.

781
00:42:36,205 --> 00:42:37,701
We should do this again!
