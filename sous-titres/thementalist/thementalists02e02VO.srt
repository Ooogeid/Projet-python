1
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,210
What's the fuss?

2
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,360
Slept through Lisbon’s
briefing in the van, didn’t you?

3
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,650
- Like a baby.
- Yeah, the victim's name is Kristin Marley.

4
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,050
She worked at the state capitol for some
lady senator, went missing three days ago.

5
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,880
Rumor is she was having an
affair with the senator's husband.

6
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,820
- My bet, she's a jumper. 
- I hope not.

7
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,140
If she's a jumper, job's done.

8
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:46,720
Yeah, the senator's husband dumps her, she wants
to make him feel bad, she comes out here...

9
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,230
- Splat.
- Don't talk that way.

10
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,940
Okay, not splat. Bam.

11
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,370
There's nothing worse than suicide.

12
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,450
Human life is sacred. When someone
takes their own life, it's a tragedy.

13
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,450
Sacramento P.D.'s handing
the case over to us.

14
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,360
Let's go talk to the coroner.

15
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:07,040
Shall I recap the case, sleepyhead?

16
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:13,580
Kristin Marley- lady senator's aide,
rumored romance with the senator's husband.

17
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,000
Very good.

18
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:19,800
Oh, I trained myself to hear and
take in information while asleep.

19
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,700
- The others told you?
- Yes, they did.

20
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:26,240
At this point, there's no way to determine
what happened to the victim, agent Lisbon.

21
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,040
I- I simply can't help you.

22
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:29,940
Well, can you tell how
long she's been dead?

23
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,380
I couldn't possibly, given
the evidence available.

24
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,740
Well, do you think it was
a homicide or a suicide?

25
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,630
- Couldn't say.
- What's your guess?

26
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,590
I'm not in the habit
of-of guessing.

27
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,180
Please don't touch the decedent.

28
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,000
You-you-you detectives
always want the instant answers.

29
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:49,970
What I do is science. Science will
uncover the truth, but she will be precise,

30
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:54,730
methodical and take her time
before she renders her decision.

31
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,240
I wonder if science can
remove the stick from his butt.

32
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,870
- I heard that.
- You're right. We want facts.

33
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,200
Fortunately, we have them.

34
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,140
- Oh, we do?
- In abundance.

35
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,900
You're the consultant that
pretends to read minds, aren't you?

36
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,740
No. I don't pretend to
read minds. I do read minds.

37
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,170
But don't we all? Look at Lisbon.
You can see what she's thinking.

38
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,750
No kidding.

39
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,050
And I can see what
you're thinking right now.

40
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,860
Uh, I was thinking that
you, sir, are a bumptious fool,

41
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,680
and I was wondering exactly what
training in forensic pathology you have.

42
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:32,220
Ah, but right before that, you were wondering
whether you would choose Lisbon or Van Pelt

43
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:36,000
as your concubine in that little fantasy
kingdom you like to visits sometimes.

44
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,130
I... I do not.

45
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:43,390
Oh, and-and you're right. I-I
know nothing of forensic pathology.

46
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,620
But agent Van Pelt, she
might offer her theory.

47
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,500
- Or I might not.
- Look at her feet.

48
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,470
- I did.
- And what question presents itself?

49
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,990
- Where's her other shoe?
- Exactly.

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,920
It wasn't up on the bridge.
It could be in her car.

51
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,470
Even if it was, why would she walk to the
middle of the bridge with one shoe on?

52
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,230
- Why would she do that?
- Bingo!

53
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,260
There's no need to be patronizing.

54
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,410
So she must have been carried.

55
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,010
She didn't kill herself. She
was murdered, then dropped over.

56
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,050
Or thrown over still alive.

57
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:19,570
- Better than suicide.
- It's...

58
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,880
a theory.

59
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,970
It's lovely to meet you, doc. You're
a horse's ass, but you mean well.

60
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,030
I'll be in the van.

61
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:33,440
My apologies, sir. Cho, tell the
Sacramento P.D. that it's a homicide.

62
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:37,110
Rigsby, Van Pelt, see what the sheriff's
department got in their investigation.

63
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,280
All right.

64
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,990
<font color=#70DBDB>The Mentalist Season02
Episode02 The Scarlet Letter</font>

65
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,580
Kristin had been interning
here for about nine months.

66
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:00,860
She came in at the start of the
last session, right out of college.

67
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:04,360
I liked her. She was sweet, 
young, in a good way.

68
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,450
Who did she work for?

69
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:06,870
Senator Melinda Batson.

70
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,210
She's an up-and-comer
from the central valley.

71
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,700
Please put that down.

72
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:18,490
Anything to the rumor that Kristin was
having an affair with Batson's husband?

73
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,730
Elliott Batson- he's
Melinda’s chief of staff.

74
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,180
We've heard the rumors.
Everyone denies it.

75
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,290
There's no evidence anything happened.

76
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,320
The media seem to think there is.

77
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,990
You want to get me started
on what they believe?

78
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:35,840
Frankly, when you've worked here as long as I have,
you hear a lot of stories about wild behavior.

79
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,940
- Most of them aren't true.
- Except the ones that are.

80
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,660
Sorry.

81
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:48,880
- Hello?
- Hello? Hello? Hello?

82
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,680
I've issued a statement, and
I’m not taking any questions.

83
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,730
We're not press. We're CBI.

84
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,550
Agent Teresa Lisbon, Patrick Jane.

85
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,410
Right. Sorry. You called.

86
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,660
Melinda Batson.

87
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,070
This is my husband Elliott.

88
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,480
Tough day around here.

89
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,950
- Is this Kristin’s desk?
- Yes.

90
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,800
Come inside.

91
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:28,260
- Jane. Care to join us?
- I'll be right there.

92
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,730
Anything unusual about Kristin’s
behavior the day she disappeared?

93
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,740
No, she was, uh, cheerful.

94
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:53,690
Finished work, left
at 6:00, I think, uh...

95
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,980
- A little after 6:00.
- after 6:00 then.

96
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,770
Did she say where she was going?

97
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,220
- No.
- No.

98
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:03,850
She... was having
trouble with her family.

99
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,480
It was her stepmother, right?

100
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,110
Her natural parents are
dead, and for some reason,

101
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,490
her stepmother called a
bunch of times that day.

102
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,620
Did Kristin tell you what it was about?

103
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:16,620
- No.
- No.

104
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:21,980
No. I-I was surprised. I-I
thought they were estranged.

105
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,270
What was your relationship
to Kristin, Mr. Batson?

106
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,810
Oh, please. Please. We know
where you're going with this.

107
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,450
- Melinda, I- 
- No, let's just haul the trash out in the open.

108
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,940
You want to know if she and
Elliott were sleeping together.

109
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:56,350
- Were you?
- Never. It's a rumor. That's all.

110
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,240
Rumors usually happen for a reason.

111
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,430
- Well... 
- I'll give you the reason, politics.

112
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,450
You want to take a female
politician down a few notches?

113
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,460
Throw mud on her marriage.

114
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,640
Where were you the
night Kristin was killed?

115
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:28,020
Here. I was on a conference call
with a trade delegation from Taiwan.

116
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,250
We talked until after 11:00.

117
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,340
I was with him the whole time.

118
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,120
We'll be married three
years this October, and...

119
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:42,520
today's news excepted,
uh, we've never been happier.

120
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,070
That's hard to believe.

121
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:48,650
What does that mean?

122
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,870
Well, there's nothing going
on between you right now.

123
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,330
Excuse me? What?

124
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,790
I'm sorry. I-I meant
sexually, no heat. Right?

125
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,740
I think we're done here.

126
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,590
You'd think a politician
would have thicker skin.

127
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:11,040
You accused them of lying about their sex
life, and you're surprised they're upset?

128
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:14,300
Oh, come on. You're buying
that happy talk? Really?

129
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,650
- Agent Minelli, sir.
- Agent Lisbon.

130
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,550
I asked him down. Uh, Walter
Crew, Melinda Batson’s dad.

131
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,940
You're agents, uh, Jane and Lisbon?

132
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,650
Yeah, we are.

133
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,000
Sorry to track you down like this.

134
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:31,760
I asked Virgil here to introduce me to the
team handling the poor Marley girl's case.

135
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:35,390
Walter has been a friend
of the CBI for some time.

136
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:39,060
He was an extremely influential
legislator for what, 20 years?

137
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,010
26, but who's counting?

138
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:44,250
Anyway, I’m old news now.

139
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,740
The only thing I lobby
for is a good tee time.

140
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,350
Why the interest in the
poor Marley girl's case?

141
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,300
Interest? I liked her.

142
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,040
Yeah, met her in Melinda’s office.

143
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:58,440
She was good people, came from a tough
background- didn't let that stop her.

144
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:02,280
I know how difficult it is to get straight
answers from the people in that building there.

145
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:05,680
If you have any problems,
you just let me know.

146
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,920
I can still knock heads.

147
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,780
- Oh, we'll be fine.
- Just let me know.

148
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,170
- Virgil.
- Walter.

149
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,660
- Take care.
- Sir.

150
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:19,680
I hate walks, Lisbon. I know
they're healthy. I don't care.

151
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,630
Put me in a chair, I’m a happy man.

152
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:24,380
But when Walter Crew asked me to
stroll with him down to the capitol,

153
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,620
I say, "of course, Walter. "
You get my drift?

154
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:27,640
I do.

155
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:30,570
Step carefully. I want daily reports.

156
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,650
Oh, and, uh, how did the
Batson interview go?

157
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,360
- Oh, that was very exciting.
- What did he do?

158
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,500
Nothing that can't be repaired.

159
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,880
Teresa, nice of you to drop by.

160
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,570
I know I’m late. I'm sorry.

161
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,910
"Late" is an interesting
word in this context.

162
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,900
You were supposed to be here...

163
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:07,070
42 minutes ago.

164
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,770
I know. The point is, I’m here now.

165
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,120
We're supposed to talk, so let's talk.

166
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,470
I have another patient
scheduled in eight minutes.

167
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,440
I can talk fast.

168
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,500
This is the third time you've been late.

169
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,950
What can I say? Lot of
people getting killed.

170
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,810
Can I get a coffee?

171
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:36,220
Do you know why counseling is mandatory for
CBI agents who've been involved in a shooting?

172
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:39,350
Because nobody would
come if it was voluntary?

173
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:45,610
And that's what it remains mandatory
until I sign and file this form.

174
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,570
See you next week.

175
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,320
This is unnecessary. I'm
fine. I'm not traumatized.

176
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:58,060
A man pointed a gun at you, a
man who intended to kill you.

177
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,910
- Fortunately, Jane shot him first.
- It doesn't matter.

178
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:05,950
You went from thinking you were going
to be killed to watching a man die-

179
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:10,240
two of the most wrenching experiences we can
have- and you went through them in seconds.

180
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,730
- You don't think that affected you?
- No.

181
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:17,060
You really want to keep
seeing me, don't you?

182
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:20,600
Next week, on time.

183
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,580
Fine.

184
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:37,990
There's a stain on the ceiling that looks
like Elvis, but today, it looks more like a...

185
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,840
Basset hound.

186
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,600
Someone call the media. It's a miracle.

187
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:45,090
Or maybe someone's moved my couch. Cho?

188
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,040
- Did you move my couch?
- No. Why would I?

189
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,380
Excuse me?

190
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,400
Did you move the couch?

191
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:57,390
I had to, uh, change a light. Problem?

192
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,950
No, no, no. Can you help
me move it back, please?

193
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,110
I got a thing I...
thanks. Just up there.

194
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,240
I think it's this way.

195
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,710
Just a little.

196
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,170
That's it. Let me just try to...

197
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:21,460
Perfect. Thank you. Elvis is back.

198
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,040
Anything on the stepmom?

199
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,630
Her name's Charlotte McAdoo.

200
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:29,080
She called Kristin 11 times in the
two days before she disappeared.

201
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,420
Any idea what that was about?

202
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,210
No, but her son Harlan had been
picked up on a carjacking charge.

203
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,660
He posted bail the day Kristin disappeared,
claimed he had nothing to do with the carjacking,

204
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,150
said he was with
Kristin when it happened.

205
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,080
He used Kristin as his alibi?

206
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,120
How bad's Harlan?

207
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,100
Well, mostly car theft, some assault.

208
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,580
What did Charlotte
have to say about that?

209
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:46,130
She won't answer her
phone, won't call back.

210
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,950
We're heading out to talk to her.

211
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:51,020
- Shouldn't we be looking for Kristin’s lover?
- Who?

212
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:55,050
Elliott Batson’s alibi checked out, and
there's no sign she was seeing someone else.

213
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,330
- We've checked.
- Well, not enough.

214
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,830
She was an immature romantic
looking for escape and adventure.

215
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:02,700
She was having an affair.

216
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:05,050
We searched her place thoroughly.

217
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,890
- She kept the affair well-hidden. 
- Well, of course.

218
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,460
It's an adventure because it's a secret.

219
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:14,230
But I expect she'll tell us who it was.

220
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,450
I'll bite. How?

221
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,350
Check this out.

222
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,360
She was a collector.

223
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:24,220
She kept sand from every
beach she ever went to.

224
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,520
She would have kept a memento
of her lover, something small-

225
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:32,120
I bet she kept it in a fancy jewelry
box, the kind with a figurine on the lid.

226
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:35,230
There was a fancy jewelry box like
that in her bedroom- a ballerina.

227
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,800
Ballerina-she's
the type.

228
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,940
But we checked it. There's
nothing in it but cheap jewelry.

229
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,600
- Did you check in the secret compartment?
- The...

230
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:45,310
The secret compartment either on the bottom
or one of the sides. They usually have one.

231
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:49,260
- It's worth taking a look.
- Fine.

232
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:57,090
Forget about Bosco.

233
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,590
He's got something.

234
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,220
Yeah, he's got Red John, and we don't.

235
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:06,560
No. No, he's got something
new on the case, new evidence.

236
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,350
How can you tell?

237
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,190
It's clear as can be.
I'll be right back.

238
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,680
Jane, Red John belongs to Bosco now.

239
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:15,120
I don't like it either, but
you're gonna have to deal with it.

240
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,650
Do you want a coffee? I'm
gonna bring you a coffee.

241
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,290
I need copies of each of
these sent over to division.

242
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,420
What's he doing in there?

243
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,440
He said you told him to wait in there.

244
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:34,100
We'll finish later.

245
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,880
- Get away from my desk.
- Where'd you go?

246
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,360
I've been here almost half an hour.

247
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,830
And stop hacking my pass codes
and stop hustling my people.

248
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,620
It's not doing you any good, you know.

249
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,690
I don't know what you're talking about.

250
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,830
What'd you get on Red John?

251
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,140
And what makes you think I got anything?

252
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,390
The folder- you moved it
when you saw me, protected it.

253
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:58,060
It's the one thing
you'd protect from me.

254
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:01,980
It's the cover-up that
gave you away. What is it?

255
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:05,330
It's none of your business, so go.

256
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,060
You need to understand something.

257
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:11,750
Red John doesn't make mistakes.
He doesn't leave clues.

258
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,520
If you have new evidence, it's
because he wants you to have it.

259
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,190
The question isn't "what does it mean?"

260
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,180
it's "why did he give it to you?"

261
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:21,020
- That's deep.
- Tell me what it is. I can help you.

262
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,720
Have you ever seen a crack addict
when they're begging for a hit?

263
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:27,150
You got that same look
in your eye that they get.

264
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,710
You've got me all figured out.

265
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,750
Hey, Van Pelt. Did you get it?

266
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:36,660
There's a secret compartment,
just like you said.

267
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,700
- And what was in it?
- Nothing.

268
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:41,370
It's empty.

269
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,840
All right.

270
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,980
- Bad news, huh?
- No, not at all.

271
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:51,440
It's like you said-it's the
cover-up that gave you away.

272
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,740
You're an addict, Jane. You need help.

273
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:58,200
- You're making a mistake.
- You can go.

274
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,220
So I got tickets to the Kings game
tomorrow night. You want to go?

275
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:11,030
- I'm going out.
- Who with?

276
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,320
The niece of the shopkeeper
we met on that Red John thing.

277
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,890
Oh, finally. It took you long enough.

278
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,630
- 5-B?
- Yeah.

279
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,980
Yeah, we talked on the phone.
She's nice. We'll see how it goes.

280
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,230
Oh, I expect a full report.

281
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,080
In your dreams.

282
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,930
Hey, I got you that number. You owe me.

283
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,670
No.

284
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:33,220
- Charlotte McAdoo?
- Yeah.

285
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,640
We need to talk to you about
your stepdaughter, Kristin Marley.

286
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,270
You know that Kristin’s
dead, right, Charlotte?

287
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,230
What about it?

288
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,160
I guess you're pretty broken up.

289
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:51,810
She wasn't my kid. I'm
not the huggy type. Sue me.

290
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:55,100
If you didn't like Kristin, why'd you make
all those calls right before she disappeared?

291
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,450
Don't remember.

292
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,870
It was a week ago.

293
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:01,260
I'm old. My memory's bad.

294
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,560
Did it have something to
do with your son Harlan?

295
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:04,790
What about Harlan?

296
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:07,180
He used Kristin as an
alibi when he was arrested,

297
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:10,250
but Kristin told Sacramento p. D. she
hadn't seen Harlan for months.

298
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:13,980
Were you asking Kristin to change her
story and lie an alibi for her stepbrother?

299
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:16,820
- No, that's crazy.
- Where is Harlan?

300
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:19,010
I don't know. I haven't
seen him for days.

301
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,990
Okay. Thanks for your time.

302
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:26,710
- That's... That's it?
- We'll see ourselves out. Thank you.

303
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,410
You think Charlotte smokes
filtered and unfiltered?

304
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,450
Not if she's got a
visitor. Bathroom or closet?

305
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,220
- Bathroom.
- I think closet. You want to bet?

306
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:43,270
- What do I get if I win?
- I pay for lunch next week.

307
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,080
I win, you tell me about your date.

308
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,000
That's enough time.

309
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:51,020
- Hey, Harlan.
- Oh, crap.

310
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:53,150
Harlan, were you in the
bathroom or the closet?

311
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,980
- Closet. Wh-
- told ya.

312
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,430
- We didn't bet.
- Yes, we did.

313
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,890
No law against being in a closet.

314
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,240
No, Harlan, but it is kinda suspicious.

315
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,380
You got no right to hold me.

316
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:13,030
We're just talking.

317
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,610
All right, what do you
want to talk about?

318
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,100
Kristin Marley- when
did you see her last?

319
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,290
- What happened to her?
- You tell us.

320
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,520
I got nothing to say about her.

321
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,020
You must be mad that she didn't back
your alibi on the carjacking charge, huh?

322
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,760
First of all, that arrest
was completely bogus.

323
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:37,770
And "B", that stuck-up bitch don't
get what the word "family" means, so...

324
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,890
What is that?

325
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:41,320
Family's supposed to
help when you're down.

326
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:44,710
But she gets a job in the capitol
with some big money friends, and pow-

327
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:47,390
she's too good for the
people she grew up with.

328
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,320
She don't get what the word
"family" is all about, you know?

329
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:53,210
Didn't. She's dead.

330
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:57,680
Yeah. That's too bad.

331
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:03,350
- Did you have any contact with Kristin after you posted bail, Harlan?
- No.

332
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,380
- None?
- That's what I said.

333
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:08,170
It's funny, 'cause our tech guys have
been going through her cell phone.

334
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,820
There's some deleted texts on it.

335
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:13,650
Four of them were from you
the day she disappeared.

336
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:18,280
No. That's what you call
a- a glitch-computer thing.

337
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,810
You were threatening Kristin
to get her to lie for you, right?

338
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,590
- Didn't say that.
- I could see why you'd do it.

339
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,770
You're facing serious time.

340
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,130
You arresting me?

341
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:33,320
You got no right to
hold me if you ain't.

342
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:36,230
You're not under arrest,
but you are out on bail,

343
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,190
and that can be revoked if the judge
thinks you're not being cooperative.

344
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,680
Do you want a soda, Harlan?

345
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,270
I want chips.

346
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:53,370
If he took Kristin’s body to the
bridge, he put her in his trunk.

347
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,360
It's worth taking a look. I'll
call the district attorney.

348
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:58,570
If Harlan hears we're looking at his car, he'll
be out the door before the warrant comes through.

349
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:03,360
We're gonna make him
want to stay. Van Pelt.

350
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,250
You're taking over the McAdoo interview.

351
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,520
I'm totally ready for that. I
can get him to confess to this.

352
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:13,270
Yeah, maybe.

353
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,240
The main thing is, you keep him in there
long enough for us to search his car.

354
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,220
Be friendly. He thinks he's
a player. He'll eat it up.

355
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:23,770
- What do you mean, be friendly?
- Need a map?

356
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,920
Good luck.

357
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,970
I heard Bosco cleaned
your clock this morning.

358
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,410
Oh, that's one interpretation.

359
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:44,120
I get it. It's tough to have
Red John taken away like that.

360
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:47,830
Bet you'd give a lot to know what
they're saying in Bosco's office.

361
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:56,160
Yeah. Yeah, I would.

362
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:57,910
You gotta let it go, man.

363
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,710
Forget about the jewelry
box. You missed one. So what?

364
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:05,210
Actually, I didn't. I'm pursuing an
independent line of investigation,

365
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,780
gonna crack this case in 24 hours.

366
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,820
I think we might be
ahead of you this time.

367
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,570
Hi, Harlan. I'm agent Van Pelt.

368
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:32,150
Special agent Lisbon asked
me to take over the interview.

369
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:36,560
- Why?
- She's busy... With something else.

370
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:44,710
So I’ve looked through your
file, and it's, uh, it's very...

371
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:49,090
- What?
- Well...

372
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,220
I don't think you had
anything to do with this crime.

373
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,380
Thank you. That's what I’ve been saying.

374
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:58,890
It's just a big
misunderstanding, I’m sure.

375
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:00,960
Yeah. You got that right.

376
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:04,870
But let's fill out the forms
so everyone's happy, okay?

377
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,510
Chips.

378
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:16,820
So let's make a time line of everywhere
you've been since Kristin disappeared.

379
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,870
Okay.

380
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,670
You want another?

381
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,630
These all pictures of your daughter?

382
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,960
Yes, they are.

383
00:22:54,980 --> 00:23:00,240
Oh, it's surprising there's not more
pictures of you, given your standing, that is.

384
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:03,130
What, me talking to a
bunch of famous windbags?

385
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,960
Had those, took 'em down. Waste of space.

386
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:08,560
- Thank you.
- No, my days are over.

387
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:10,720
Melinda has got the future.

388
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:14,420
She could go far, very
far, if she listens to me.

389
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,160
Now what did you want to talk about?

390
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:25,990
How long were you sleeping with
Kristin Marley before she was killed?

391
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,050
What makes you think I was?

392
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:34,290
You're a politician- ambitious, narcissistic,
addicted to the love of strangers.

393
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:38,690
She was beautiful, impressionable,
no doubt flattered by your attentions.

394
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,900
And you're not the sort of man to
deny yourself an object of desire.

395
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:46,440
I'm married 38 years, Mr. Jane.

396
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:49,500
As I said.

397
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:53,640
Uh, even if what you say is
true- and I’m not saying it is-

398
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,400
what does that have to do
with poor Kristin’s murder?

399
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:01,740
Blackmail or something like it.

400
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,290
The business adultery leads to.

401
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:12,420
But even if I am
what you say I am-

402
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:15,430
and I’m not
saying I am-

403
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,610
wouldn't I have faced a situation like this
before and handled it without killing anybody?

404
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:24,230
It's a good point.
I'll think about that.

405
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,500
Please.

406
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:32,330
- Anything else?
- What? Sorry?

407
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:37,610
Well, whoever it is, I’ll have the killer by
the morning, so, uh, you should act accordingly.

408
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,170
Thank you for your time.

409
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:48,190
You think Harlan ever
cleans out his car?

410
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,040
So where you taking the
shopkeeper's niece for dinner?

411
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:52,880
- I'd rather not talk about it.
- Why not?

412
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:55,350
- It's private.
- Oh, come on.

413
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,040
Let's talk about somethin' else.

414
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,500
I'll call technical services. They
can pop that lock in 20 seconds.

415
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,830
It'll take 'em 2 hours to get here.

416
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:06,110
It took you two hours to open the door last time you
tried this, and we had to pay for the busted window.

417
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,840
Fluke.

418
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:10,940
- If I had a date, I’d tell you about it.
- Yeah.

419
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,530
I would, tell you anything
you wanted to know.

420
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:16,610
Okay, you ever gonna man up
and make a move on Van Pelt?

421
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:19,570
- Fine. Don't tell me.
- Right.

422
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:38,020
Check this out. Wasn't the other one
of these on Kristin Marley’s foot?

423
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,270
I'll call Lisbon.

424
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,990
Kristin’s shoe was in your trunk.

425
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,650
No. No way.

426
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,320
You want to tell us
how it got there, Harlan?

427
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:52,690
I don't know. Maybe
you put it there, huh?

428
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:56,240
You have no alibi for the night
of Kristin’s disappearance.

429
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,400
I told you. I was with my mom.

430
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:01,460
She was concealing you
when we went to pick you up.

431
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:03,660
- It's not gonna cut it.
- You were mad at Kristin.

432
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,490
- A little, but- -
you threatened her.

433
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,420
No.

434
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:13,180
Okay, I mean, a-a little, but come
on. I-I wouldn't hurt her for real.

435
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:16,010
That's not much of a story, Harlan.

436
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:20,060
- I thought you believed me.
- You were wrong.

437
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:24,720
You know what? The hell
with this. I'm outta here.

438
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:25,880
Not quite yet.

439
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,160
- Oh, you're gonna stop me?
- Yeah.

440
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,280
- Did you make the arrest?
- I did.

441
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:35,130
- Ah, victory is yours.
- Yes, it is.

442
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,910
- What?
- Oh, nothing.

443
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,700
- Come on.
- No. No.

444
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:44,510
I'm still waiting.

445
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:49,550
Throwing the body off the
bridge was a smart move-

446
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,060
good chance the coroner
would declare it a suicide.

447
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,810
Do you really think Harlan
McAdoo would come up with that?

448
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:01,660
Dumb people can come up with smart ideas,
and smart people can come up with dumb ones.

449
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:04,020
Eh, true.

450
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:08,000
I'll have the real killer
here in 12 hours or so.

451
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:10,420
- What are you talking about?
- You'll see. Bye.

452
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:11,600
Jane.

453
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,940
Hey, boss, you want me to send
McAdoo down to be arraigned?

454
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:19,870
Not yet. Sit on him. See if he comes up
with something useful once he calms down.

455
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:28,440
Obviously, you've got to get it
out of committee before- Mr. Jane?

456
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:30,690
Don't mind me.

457
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,570
What are you doing?

458
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,990
Hard at work, on the case.

459
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:38,650
I don't understand. We got a call
from agent Minelli saying that

460
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,920
an arrest had been
made-Kristin’s stepbrother.

461
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:43,530
Nope, nope, nope. Wrong guy.

462
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,760
How can that be?

463
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:49,250
Simple miscarriage of
justice, happens all the time.

464
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,040
What does that mean?

465
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,970
It means I have to find the real killer.

466
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:56,290
The real killer? How?

467
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,900
Oh, Kristin was a collector.

468
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:02,860
Ergo, the identity of Kristin’s
killer will be in her things.

469
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:04,420
How can you be sure it's there?

470
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,710
Oh, I’m sure.

471
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:08,570
Mr. Jane, this isn't acceptable. First
you accost my father-

472
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,050
oh, I wouldn't use the word "accost. "

473
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:11,550
now you're ransacking my office.

474
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:14,810
- Calm down, Melinda.
- I won't calm down. I thought we put this behind us.

475
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,490
Not much of a
campaign slogan-

476
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:20,600
"Batson-so tough on crime, she
puts the innocent behind bars. "

477
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:26,500
do what you have to do. Uh,
we'll help in any way we can.

478
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:29,620
Great. Thank you. There's a
couple of boxes right there,

479
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:34,590
if you could just, uh, grab one
each and follow me to my car.

480
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:43,340
- Lisbon, didn't you arrest McAdoo?
- Yeah, we did.

481
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:45,250
D.A. says you haven't sent
him down to be arraigned.

482
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,760
We have 48 hours to do that.
We still have some loose ends.

483
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:50,750
- What-what loose
ends? Him? - No.

484
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:53,570
What are you doing? No, don't tell me.

485
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,800
I want this off my desk.

486
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,500
Get McAdoo to the D.A. tonight.

487
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,970
- How hard is Crew leaning on you?
- He's not.

488
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,730
- Then who's doing it for him?
- No one.

489
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,760
- Is this my case, sir? 
- Yes, but-

490
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:09,710
then it's my decision as to when the suspect
is handed over to the district attorney, right?

491
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:16,140
If McAdoo isn't in the D.A.'s office first thing
tomorrow morning, this becomes a different conversation.

492
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,660
- You won't regret this.
- I already do.

493
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,830
<i>Hey, this is Lisbon. Leave a
message. I'll call you back.</i>

494
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:57,750
I found what I was looking for. I don't
want to risk taking it out of the office,

495
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,690
so I’m gonna put it in the top
right-hand drawer of your desk.

496
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,410
When you get this, call me.

497
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,960
"ah ha"?

498
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,870
You-you startled
me. I'll...

499
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,720
I'll just get out of your way.

500
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,960
Stand still. Turn around.

501
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,520
What is this?

502
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:56,460
Who are you and who are you working for?

503
00:30:56,770 --> 00:31:00,980
I work for the building.
I clean. I clean.

504
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:05,310
Oh, you're not a cleaner. Look
at this place. It's a mess.

505
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:07,160
You're the fixer.

506
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:09,540
You've been listening
in on our conversations.

507
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:14,110
What's that? That's one
of the bugs you placed.

508
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,470
I found it in the overhead light.

509
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,720
When I told Van Pelt to go
and check out the jewelry box,

510
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:21,860
you overheard and you went there first.

511
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:24,850
And it was you that placed
the shoe in McAdoo’s trunk.

512
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,990
I'm on the cleaning Crew.

513
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,780
- Oh, really?
- I'm new. You can call my supervisor.

514
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:35,410
Marty, uh, Marty, uh, Toretta, huh?

515
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,050
- Call him up right now.
- No.

516
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,170
Wake him up.

517
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:46,340
I got no idea what
you're talking about here.

518
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:50,060
We're talking about accessory to
murder, conspiracy, obstruction.

519
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:52,380
Who hired you?

520
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:57,400
Murder? Oh, I don't feel too good.

521
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:59,660
- Can I sit-can I- 
- Oh, take a seat.

522
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:01,620
Thanks.

523
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:06,550
All right. No, no, no. Calm.

524
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:08,810
- Are you calm?
- Sure.

525
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:13,700
All right, now I want
you to lift your gun out

526
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:17,620
with two fingers and
slide it across the floor.

527
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:26,010
Now get your cuffs.

528
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,140
This isn't gonna work.

529
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,720
The door- hook
yourself up.

530
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:42,640
Toss the keys.

531
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:50,810
- Now you and I are gonna walk out here.
- Sure.

532
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:53,770
It's a little stroll.

533
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,630
Find out where he goes.

534
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,010
- Oh, no, I think-
- Go, now! Go!

535
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:19,340
Keys, please. There. Yeah.

536
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:19,870
so, agent Lisbon, here we are.

537
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:22,210
What's this about?

538
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,270
This is Art Cavalleri.

539
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:29,110
He's the private investigator one of you hired
to wiretap and obstruct our investigation.

540
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,090
Really?

541
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:32,640
He's agreed to talk in
exchange for leniency.

542
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,170
I called you down here to
offer you the same deal.

543
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,080
Well, that's very nice of you.

544
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:39,160
You can discuss it with
my attorney. Melinda?

545
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:40,280
I have nothing to say.

546
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:43,660
Even if you had nothing to do
with Kristin Marley’s murder,

547
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:46,550
with what Cavalleri is saying about
the conspiracy and the cover-up,

548
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,480
you're all gonna do a
lot of time in prison.

549
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:50,850
- I don't need to hear any more.
- W-wait. I-I do.

550
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:53,540
What kind of leniency
are we talking about here?

551
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:56,750
- Elliott.
- Depends, Mr. Batson. What do you know?

552
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,440
I need an assurance that any charges
related to the murder will be dropped.

553
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:02,870
Got it, as long as you didn't have
anything to do with the murder.

554
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:06,500
If you'll excuse us, I want some
private time with my family right now.

555
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:09,340
Mr. Crew, stay there. Go on.

556
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:14,940
Oh, come on. Spit it out, man. The marriage
is a sham. She's gay. You're the beard.

557
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,790
It was kind of obvious from the start.

558
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:21,640
- I had an arrangement with Melinda.
- Elliott, don't.

559
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:24,610
I agreed to marry
Melinda in exchange for...

560
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:26,890
Certain financial considerations.

561
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:28,200
Batson, we had a deal.

562
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:31,080
Did that deal include time
in prison? I don't think so.

563
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:34,720
So it was your own people that started
the rumor about you and Kristin-

564
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:37,350
- to hide her affair with Melinda.
- Yes.

565
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:40,800
I'm sorry, Melinda.

566
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:45,010
Kristin broke it off shortly
before she disappeared.

567
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,520
Melinda was upset.

568
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:50,500
And were you with Melinda
the night Kristin disappeared?

569
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,780
No. I didn't see her
until late that night.

570
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:59,760
She was... A mess.

571
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:01,990
But she wouldn't tell
me what had happened.

572
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:06,220
Kristin had something hidden in
her apartment- a memento, I guess.

573
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,700
Lovers' memento.

574
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:11,710
Cavalleri had found it, but
we took it out of his car.

575
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,590
It could be a "w, " but
I think it's an "m. "

576
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:24,930
You and your father were both
having an affair with Kristin.

577
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,420
No.

578
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,310
- No. I-
- Melinda.

579
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,990
I had a relationship with Kristin.

580
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:41,060
He seduced her... Took her...

581
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,470
The way he's taken women his whole life.

582
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,770
I was trying to make a point.

583
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,500
You were what?

584
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:49,310
- I was trying to
show you- - what?

585
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,740
She was just another girl, that she
was just another trashy little girl.

586
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:56,290
You thought you were in love,
but she was just having a fling.

587
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:03,620
He believed that you were giving away a very
bright political career because of some strumpet.

588
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:05,420
What happened that night?

589
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:16,380
Melinda, every day you don't talk
is another day you're on the news.

590
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:27,000
I knew Kristin was seeing someone,
but I didn't know who it was.

591
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:31,310
So I followed her...

592
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,140
And that's when I saw my father.

593
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,960
After he left, I went
into her apartment.

594
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,230
She had these stone bookends.

595
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:54,180
I grabbed one.

596
00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:00,060
Next thing I knew,
Kristin was on the floor.

597
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:05,000
It just... Happened.

598
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:15,710
And then I did what I always
do when I’m in trouble.

599
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:19,330
I called daddy.

600
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:23,450
He said he knew someone
who could fix it.

601
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:26,520
Ah, the fixer.

602
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:30,760
You can let Cavalleri go now. Watch.

603
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,040
Oh, my god.

604
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:48,480
He's dead.

605
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:52,900
Yeah.

606
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:02,290
You abused a corpse to get a confession.

607
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:05,460
Used. Used a corpse. There's no "ab. "

608
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:07,940
I’m appalled. I'm...

609
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,590
I don't know what to say.

610
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:12,540
Sir, it's not like we killed him.

611
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,280
His neck was broken in the crash.

612
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:17,040
- We got a confession.
- Suppose you didn't.

613
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,650
Suppose you'd been wrong.

614
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:24,150
Have you any idea of the vastness
of the crap storm that would follow?

615
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:26,130
It would blot out the sun.

616
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:30,150
Sir, Crew and Batson manipulated
us into arresting the wrong person.

617
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,090
They bugged our offices
and subverted our case.

618
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,160
I don't think we did anything wrong.

619
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:36,920
I think we should be commended.

620
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:42,330
Congratulations. You finally
got her to drink the kool-aid.

621
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,990
Check yourself, agent.

622
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,770
All of you.

623
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,200
Well, I thought that went pretty well.

624
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,890
Great, yeah.

625
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,980
Highlight for me was
definitely your speech-

626
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:04,430
passionate, articulate, strong.

627
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:06,850
Whatever.

628
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:19,230
Hey, good work with McAdoo,
you know, keeping him here.

629
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,110
Yeah.

630
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:25,570
You know, if boss had given me a chance, I
think I could have gotten him to confess.

631
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,200
Sure, if he wasn't, you know, innocent.

632
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:31,290
If it wasn't for that small fact,
I’m sure you'd have taken him to town.

633
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:33,300
Thanks.

634
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,620
You have any plans for tonight?

635
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:38,740
Home, TV.

636
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:42,720
- Well... Have fun.
- You, too.

637
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,200
You're gonna die alone.

638
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:54,370
- Sir?
- Morning.

639
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:57,310
- Yeah. Sir, you can't go in there.
- No, it's okay. I come in peace.

640
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,870
Great color on you.

641
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:03,650
- Go away.
- Just give me a minute, please.

642
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:08,240
I- I want you, and I want your
team to know that I got it.

643
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:11,070
I got the message. I got it.

644
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:17,190
The Red John case... belongs to you.

645
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,570
You're gonna leave us alone?

646
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,250
Yeah, that's right.

647
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,730
I don't believe that.

648
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:27,750
I brought you doughnuts- the international
law enforcement symbol of friendship.

649
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:32,670
I am trusting you to catch Red John.

650
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:37,590
I'm counting on it.

651
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,670
We will catch him. Thanks.

652
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:45,380
Good hunting.

653
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,460
Hicks, take that away. Take it far
away. Take it out of the building.

654
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:53,820
- God knows what he put in there.
- You got it.

655
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:56,420
All right, let's go over
the most recent forensics.

656
00:41:56,430 --> 00:42:00,010
There are two short, linear incised
wounds that are extremely superficial.

657
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:05,430
<i>They involve the anterior surface of the
right wrist, which measures 0.8 inches.</i>

658
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:14,710
<i>Okay, you got it. Don't tell
the locals what it's for.</i>

659
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,250
<i>Yeah, no worries.</i>

660
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:18,120
<i>Just say you're
following up on something.</i>

661
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:20,530
