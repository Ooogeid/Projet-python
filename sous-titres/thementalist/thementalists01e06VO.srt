1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,200
Mentalist, someone who uses mental acuity, hypnosis and/or suggestion.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,600
A master manipulator of thoughts and behavior.

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,800
Nevada-California State Line

4
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,790
That damn GPS is gonna  put us in California,

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,390
- I knew it. -Think positive.

6
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,090
It's Nevada. Definitely Nevada.

7
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,490
You're dreaming  We won't catch it.

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,890
Stone cold mystery.

9
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,590
Hey. Friends in the authority is running through the prints

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,300
Think we'll be able to get a quick match.

11
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,990
Hehe, we could never get that lucky.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,590
Well, we're gonna be talking to the hand for a long while.

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,690
Why is all the gloom?

14
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,790
A case is a case.

15
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,990
We are in the middle of nowhere,

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Windy as all hell, I haven't eaten anything.

17
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,990
God, the smelly reserved bitch.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,590
It's been a month assembling the victim, there's all these pieces missing.

19
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,600
There's already plenty to work with, right here.

20
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,400
It's a right hand with the number "43" on it.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,590
It's a male hand,

22
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,500
Or a not very thin female.

23
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,290
What else do we got to work with right here?

24
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,490
There's not much for analysis.

25
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,690
Let's see, it's probably a white man, mid-fifties.

26
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,290
He wrote on his right hand,

27
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,290
So he's a lefty.

28
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,190
Maybe the killer wrote some kind of message.

29
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,390
Too faded,

30
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,100
And a killer would write it bigger.

31
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,500
Consultant.

32
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,800
Smells of almond, oil, moisturizer,

33
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,300
Mastic cologne and tobacco

34
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,600
Palms are subtle,

35
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,590
Nails are professionally maintained,

36
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,200
So a rich man.

37
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,590
There's a faded tan line on the little finger

38
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,490
So we are missing pinkie ring which suggests extra work

39
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,300
In a job where extra works thrive.

40
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,560
So...

41
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,200
He's a upper manager at the hotel and gambling business

42
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,300
Total guess.

43
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,600
What do you wanna bet I'm right?

44
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,490
35 cents.

45
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,800
35 cents? Yeah.

46
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,450
I find that hard to believe

47
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:14,940
Considering huge crayon bank u probably hid behind ur bedroom door

48
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,090
That could have been filling with all the spare changes

49
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,600
You could have accumulated since you were what, 15?

50
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,990
35 cents, take it or leave it.

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,500
-I'll take it. You've got a bet. -Alright.

52
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,000
I don't think it's right to bet on such things.

53
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,990
That's a human being that died.

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,300
That's ok.

55
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,400
We're in Nevada.

56
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,190
You're in California, yeah, it would be wrong.

57
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,400
But here,

58
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,200
In Nevada,

59
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,700
It's OK to gamble on body parts.

60
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,090
The hand is three feet into the state of California

61
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,390
So he's our baby.

62
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,500
-Hooray! -Yeah, right.

63
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,090
Get our friend bags and tags and let's get outta here.

64
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,390
Do we have an ideal list?

65
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,790
The print says that it's James Quency Meier.

66
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,900
He runs the Quelita Resort & Casino

67
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,000
Come on.

68
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,200
Thank you.

69
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,590
Are you certain that he isn't still out there alive?

70
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,890
Yes, forensics evidence

71
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,800
Supports the hand being severed postmortem.

72
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,300
The rest of his body?

73
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,100
We're looking.

74
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,900
It doesn't seem real.

75
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,700
When was the last time you saw your husband?

76
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,500
Yesterday--tuesday morning.

77
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,690
Jim would often stay overnight at the resort

78
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,300
If he needed to be there late to resolve an issue,

79
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,390
Or, you know, but he would call and let me know that he was--

80
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,290
He was gonna stay so I wouldn't worry.

81
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,490
We understand that mr. Meier didn't have a cell phone.

82
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,990
He didn't believe in them.

83
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,990
So was it him that called this house from a casino phone

84
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,490
At, um, 8:05 tuesday night?

85
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,900
Yes. He was just checking in.

86
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,500
Casinos run 24 hours a day, so jim did the same.

87
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,690
I think I saw jim more than they did. You work at the casino as well?

88
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,390
Dan is a v.I.P. Guest services executive.

89
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,790
I'm a glorified house player.

90
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,390
It's more than just that, daniel. What's a house player?

91
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,200
Jim pays me to herd the whales-- the big money gamblers.

92
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,790
I play with casino money to break the ice,

93
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,790
Get the heavy action going. It's a good, steady gig.

94
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,700
Keeps me out of trouble. When was the last time you saw jim?

95
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,500
Same as ann-- yesterday on the casino floor.

96
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,500
You dad knew sinatra?

97
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,800
Sure.

98
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,000
Uh, sinatra kissed me right here on my first birthday party.

99
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,890
That's what dad always said, anyhow.

100
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,800
But you didn't believe him? Figured there'd be a photo.

101
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,900
He wasn't around much when you were growing up, was he?

102
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,700
What makes you say that?

103
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,000
Figured there'd be a photo.

104
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,900
He wasn't around a lot.

105
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,500
But he loved me. I know he did. He just...

106
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,400
He didn't have a whole lot of time.

107
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,900
The number 43 was written on mr. Meier's hand.

108
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,000
Any idea what the significance of that might be?

109
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,890
No idea.

110
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,100
Damn!

111
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,600
Stupid son of a bitch went for the 2-point conversion.

112
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,700
Excuse me. Get me a scotch, would you, hon?

113
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,800
Can you think of anybody who might want to harm your husband?

114
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,890
Jim was a well-liked man, but he stuck to his principles,

115
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,290
And that's a dangerous thing to do in his business.

116
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,790
Is there a specific instance you're

117
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,190
Thinking of? No, no. It's just a feeling

118
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,500
Mom, it's a hotel/casino and not a crack house.

119
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,700
The mafia's not running anything anymore. So you say.

120
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,590
Robbery might have been a motive.

121
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,290
Did he carry a lot of cash on him?

122
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,300
Did he wear expensive jewelry? No.

123
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,690
He didn't need cash. Jim's word was money

124
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:31,100
He wore a ring on his pinkie finger...

125
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,490
And a lucky $100,000 chip

126
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,090
On a string around his neck. That's all.

127
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,690
That's a lot of money. Was the chip legal tender?

128
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,100
In the casino, yes, but only in the casino.

129
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,100
Can you give us an exact description of the chip?

130
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,890
We want to alert the casino cashiers.

131
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,790
Yes. We have a photo of it for the insurance company.

132
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,300
I was going through all of the papers.

133
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,100
Here it is.

134
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,200
Thank you.

135
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,290
Any more body parts show up? Nothing so far.

136
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,590
Possibly the hand was the only piece cut off.

137
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,290
Does that match up to any similar cases in the past?

138
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,400
Well, this is where it gets interesting.

139
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,900
There several cases like this where a hand was purposely left to be found.

140
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,290
They're all reno and las vegas-based

141
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,390
And involved organized crime. None are more recent than...

142
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,490
Ten years ago. They do it to people

143
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,090
Who get their hands caught in the till.

144
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,000
Mafia, great. Thanks.

145
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,090
Agent lisbon? Matt etienne.

146
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,390
I'm head of security.

147
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,900
This is agent van pelt and mr. Jane from our team. Hi.

148
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,590
Well, as you can imagine,

149
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,500
We're all still pretty shell-shocked around here. I'm sorry for your loss.

150
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,300
Well, if you'll all follow me?

151
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,790
The casino's on the nevada side of the resort

152
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,590
And offers full-service gaming.

153
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,190
We recently spent $10 million upgrading the facilities

154
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,190
To improve the customers' experience. They use the same techniques

155
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,990
In state-of-the-art animal husbandry

156
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,890
To make the cows and sheep feel comfortable. Really?

157
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,290
Dim lights, soft music, a maze of passages

158
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,290
That lead you back to the pens, or, in this case, the slots.

159
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,290
Ooh, don't hold back. Speak your mind.

160
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,890
There's no clocks or windows anywhere

161
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,800
So there's no passage of time.

162
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,190
Low-priced alcohol is poured down you

163
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,890
By attractive young women.

164
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,100
Oxygen is pumped into the place to make you stay awake,

165
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,090
And the constant symphony of bells and sirens

166
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,690
That make it seem like someone's winning

167
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,690
All the time. Ah, but someone is always winning

168
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,390
You see, our machines and our games are carefully designed

169
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,290
To let every gambler have a taste of victory--

170
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,390
Just enough sugar to keep 'em pumping their money

171
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,490
Into the machines and onto the tables.

172
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,900
So what's your point? Oh, no point. I love it.

173
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,000
Well, ladies, ladies, give me love. Give me some love.

174
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,300
Who's that?

175
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,790
Cal trask-- a very serious gambler

176
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,790
And an honored guest. A whale?

177
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,890
Exactly, a whale. You guys are going to be going over

178
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,090
A bunch of boring files now, I expect.

179
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,300
So, uh, I think I'll work here, play a little,

180
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,200
Get the lay of the land.

181
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,000
Give me 100 bucks, would ya? I don't think that's such a good idea.

182
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,500
Sure you do. Come on. I'll give it back to you double.

183
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,590
Look, here's $100,

184
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,500
But you'll give me back double, right?

185
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,100
Triple.

186
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,500
Oh, yeah, baby.

187
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,100
Hi. I'm patrick.

188
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,800
Hi, patrick.

189
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,890
I accessed meier's calendar. The day he disappeared

190
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,490
He listed an 8:30 p.M. Meeting with the notation "43,"

191
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,890
Last meeting of the day. There we go with the number 43 again.

192
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,090
See if you can cross-reference it with anything else. Okay.

193
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,590
Matt? Yes?

194
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,390
From what we understand, a hand being discovered like this

195
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,990
Is an old-school mafia signature. Yes, I've heard the same thing.

196
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,390
It means an individual got caught

197
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,790
With his hand in the till.

198
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,600
You don't seriously believe that that's what happened to jim

199
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:19,490
Don corleone had him whacked? Who owns this casino?

200
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,690
Our owners are a million or so good american men and women

201
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,790
Who are shareholders in our parent company.

202
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,090
Wise guys lost control of gambling in nevada

203
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,800
A long time ago.

204
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,300
Hit me.

205
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,900
17.

206
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,700
Hit me.

207
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,800
21.

208
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,490
Well done, patrick. Thank you.

209
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,400
Could we change this up for $1,000 chips, please?

210
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,700
Hi. My name is patrick.

211
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,500
Hi, patrick.

212
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:22,400
Mr. Etienne, we have a possible code 9 at table 43.

213
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,490
What's a code 9?

214
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,000
Cheating. I'll be right there.

215
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,660
Table 43?

216
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,480
Blackjack!

217
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,700
Keep squeezin' 'em, baby. Make 'em squeal!

218
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,500
Come on, ladies.

219
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,590
Mr. Jane, may I have a word with you? Just a minute.

220
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,390
Jane. I'm on a streak.

221
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,100
Yes, you are, and we're really wondering what your secret is.

222
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,690
There's no secret. I'm memorizing the cards

223
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,790
Yes, well, mr. Jane, we don't like people doing that.

224
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,800
Is having a good memory illegal?

225
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,190
No, it's not.

226
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,590
We can only congratulate you on your good luck

227
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,900
And bar you from the establishment in the future. Oh, okay.

228
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,200
Well, that was fun while it lasted.

229
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,990
By the way, I hate to be a telltale,

230
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,290
But alexandra is robbing you blind. Excuse me?

231
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,500
She's cheating.

232
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,090
She's flashing her hidden card to the big guy

233
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,790
On the end of the table, and when that didn't work,

234
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,490
She's dealing the rest of the table cards

235
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,790
From just underneath the top of the deck

236
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,000
And holding back the top cards for him.

237
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,790
I think this is mine. Just one sec.

238
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,700
Thank you. Good luck. Good luck.

239
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,500
Good luck.

240
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,190
Ah, the hustler returns.

241
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,190
Lisbon says you won a whole bunch of money.

242
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,000
Oh, I didn't do too badly. How much you win?

243
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,200
About $250,000.

244
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,300
You won $250,000?

245
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,600
Yeah. Are they talking to the dealer lady? Yes.

246
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,500
Very impressive scheme you set up with your cousin mose--

247
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,990
60% on anything under 5 grand, 50/50 on anything above.

248
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,290
You must be living pretty large.

249
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,090
If by "large" you mean saving up to buy my mom a new live

250
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,200
Before she dies, then sure, living real large.

251
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,190
That big twerp told you all of that?

252
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,320
Started singing like menudo the minute he sat down.

253
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,990
Oh, good help is so hard to find.

254
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,290
Meier was on to you. That's what the meeting was for.

255
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,290
He probably fired you on the spot, didn't he?

256
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,530
It's pretty ballsy to come back in to work after something like that.

257
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:45,290
Only someone who knew

258
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,100
He'd been killed would do that. I didn't kill him.

259
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,790
Then how did you know before everyone else here

260
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,000
That he was dead, alexandra? I didn't. I came back to beg for my job.

261
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,090
When I heard what happened, I realized that no one knew

262
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,900
About our meeting, so I went back to work. I need this job.

263
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,290
Losing your job, going to jail-- who's gonna look after your mom

264
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,700
And that's a prospect that would make anyone upset.

265
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,090
And if you had a moment of insanity, I can understand that.

266
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,200
Anyone can understand that. I didn't kill him.

267
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,090
I wonder why meier didn't talk to etienne about her.

268
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,300
As head of security, she's ultimately his responsibility.

269
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,590
Maybe he figured etienne was in on it with her.

270
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,490
Where did you go after your talk with meier? Mm.

271
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,200
I spent the rest of the night at the hospital with my mother.

272
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,390
Uh, sorry to interrupt. Uh, quick question--

273
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,690
When meier asked you if matt etienne was involved

274
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,090
In your scam, what did you tell him?

275
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,490
I told him that mr. Etienne had nothing to do with it

276
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,800
But he does, doesn't he? No.

277
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,800
Thanks. You can go.

278
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,390
She can?

279
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,400
She can?

280
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,500
She can go, can she?

281
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,190
I'm sorry. The nevada gaming commission's gonna want to charge her

282
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,690
With gaming violations. Why should we let her go?

283
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,350
Why do we get so hung up on every little law someone breaks?

284
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,090
Because we're officers of the law?

285
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,700
Also because matt etienne is lying.

286
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,490
Now you can call him and tell him that alexandra yee

287
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,090
Cooperated with us, and based on what she had to say,

288
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,200
We'd like to speak to him first thing in the morning.

289
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,390
Okay, but if he is in cahoots with alexandra

290
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,430
He's just gonna call her and ask her what she said.

291
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:23,590
And she will swear blind she said nothing

292
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,090
Which will make out friend matt even more suspicious.

293
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,490
Why did we let her go if she gave us nothing?

294
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,390
She must have told us the truth. Which is...

295
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,200
Eh, details, details.

296
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,700
What is it?

297
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,500
Open it.

298
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,790
It's not a fake turd or anything.

299
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,000
Van pelt, catch.

300
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,100
What is this?

301
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,400
Carbon placed under extreme pressure.

302
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,090
We can't keep this stuff.

303
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,490
We can't? It's against regulations.

304
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,790
No, it's not. Why would it be?

305
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,390
I won the money fair and square,

306
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,100
And I spent it fair and square.

307
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,100
Where do the regulations come into it?

308
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,190
So where's our stuff? Your stuff?

309
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,690
Well, you didn't just get stuff for the ladies.

310
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,100
That'd be creepy.

311
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,200
Who's your daddy?

312
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,700
Thanks, man. Thanks.

313
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,590
Now it must be worth a lot of money,

314
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,490
Because this is the ugliest watch I've ever seen. It's horrible.

315
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,290
I asked for the most expensive watches they had.

316
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,900
Thanks, man.

317
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,390
All right, let's go.

318
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,090
I got us a table booked at the best restaurant in town.

319
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,790
Apparently, they tell you the name of the cow

320
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,190
Your steak came from. That's horrible.

321
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,990
Forget the steaks. We're on a case.

322
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,600
We can't be seen living it up in fancy restaurants. Good point. Uh, okay.

323
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,600
Little place on the way back to calida. Let's go.

324
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,300
So you really won all of this by memorizing cards?

325
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,590
You didn't have cards up your sleeve or anything?

326
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,300
No. That would be cheating. Just memory. How? That's impossible.

327
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,800
Not at all. Anyone can do it.

328
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,800
I'm gonna raise you three.

329
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,300
How?

330
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,890
In my mind, I've made every card in the deck

331
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,490
Into a vivid character.

332
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,100
Jack of hearts--a ballet dancer with devil's horns.

333
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,390
2 of diamonds-- a duck smoking a cigar.

334
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,190
Like that.

335
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,790
Why a duck? Doesn't matter. Every card is a living thing.

336
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,200
Every position in the deck is a location in my memory palace.

337
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:59,190
Okay, what's a memory palace? It's a place that is so clear in your mind

338
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,400
That you can walk all around it in your head.

339
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,290
Everybody's palace is different.

340
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,400
Has to be big and detailed and vivid.

341
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,490
My palace is a midwest carnival circuit

342
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,790
I used to travel with my father. Your people are carny folk.

343
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,990
You're finally starting to make sense to me.

344
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,700
Not exactly. It's a long story.

345
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,690
My point--if the tenth card in the deck

346
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,390
Is a jack of hearts, I see a devil-horned dancer

347
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,600
At the joplin, missouri, fairgrounds.

348
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,390
I'll see you.

349
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,700
Excuse me.

350
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,100
I can't see how that works.

351
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,200
Here. Shuffle these.

352
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,890
Rigsby's holding 2 pair-- 6s and 9s.

353
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:42,090
Cho--my old friend cho here-- is hoping for his fifth spade

354
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,800
To make up his flush.

355
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,500
Deal the river card and watch him get it.

356
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,600
Too hot for me.

357
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,490
Another hand?

358
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,190
Nah. Kind of takes the fun out of it

359
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,390
When you're playing with a swami. All right, guys,

360
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,190
It's been fun playing dress-up,

361
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,800
But playtime's over. Sorry, boss, what do you mean

362
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,990
This. It's kind of a waste, don't you think?

363
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,100
Well, I would have bought world peace if I could.

364
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,500
They didn't have it at the casino gift store.

365
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,890
Very limited range of items for sale.

366
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,300
You know what I mean.

367
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,200
I know those emeralds look lovely with your eyes.

368
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,090
Thank you. It's beautiful, but I can't keep it.

369
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,500
I understand.

370
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,600
Yeah, you're right.

371
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:29,990
Good night.

372
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,590
Good night.

373
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,800
Good night.

374
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,790
I'm not giving mine back. No way.

375
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,800
That's my boys. Live it up.

376
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,700
Hey, lisbon.

377
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,800
Where are you?

378
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,200
Oh, just taking a walk.

379
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,390
Ann wants to come clean.

380
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,800
I knew it. She had that air about her.

381
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,100
If you knew it, why didn't you tell us?

382
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,290
It's an exaggeration. I had a strong hunch.

383
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,200
If I told you about every hunch, you'd get very irritated.

384
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,900
Matt etienne tells me that, uh,

385
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,400
One of his employees may have shared rumors about him and me.

386
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,400
I wanted to be the first to clarify the matter for you,

387
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,990
And I wanted jessica and daniel to be here

388
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,400
So that you understand there's no subterfuge here. Okay.

389
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,700
Yes, I was having an affair with matt etienne.

390
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,700
But I didn't murder jim.

391
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,200
You knew about the affair?

392
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:49,150
Yeah.

393
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,300
I knew about it, but I didn't like it.

394
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,390
But I understood,

395
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,890
Because dad was never there for mom... Or me.

396
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,290
So no subterfuge, except for jim.

397
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,900
I'm not proud of it.

398
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,200
Matt was there for mom when dad wasn't.

399
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,400
How long had the affair been going on? Two years.

400
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,300
Do you think that matt did this to clear the field with you?

401
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,190
No. No. Maybe he had the idea

402
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,590
That that's what you wanted him to do.

403
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,800
No. You have no right to say such things

404
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,600
'cause my mother is not some sort of-- hey. Hey. Hush.

405
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,890
I betrayed my husband. I lied to him.

406
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,400
But I loved him, and I did not wish him dead.

407
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,900
Ask matt and he'll tell you the same thing.

408
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,290
We will. Mm.

409
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,600
Thanks.

410
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,900
Uh, listen, uh...

411
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,500
I don't want agent lisbon to hear about this.

412
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:52,790
She doesn't really approve of my gambling. No?

413
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,890
No. I was hoping that maybe you could set me up

414
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,900
In a good, high-stakes game of poker.

415
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,690
You know, with someone like cal trask,

416
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,100
You know, a whale.

417
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,690
I heard about your hot hands on the casino floor.

418
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,400
Yeah, I'm feelin' lucky.

419
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,900
I can set you up, sure.

420
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,200
Appreciate it. All right.

421
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,400
Mum's the word.

422
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:43,090
I'm guessing that you're not just in the neighborhood.

423
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,200
Mr. Etienne, I have a warrant to search your property.

424
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,200
That's a sweet boat.

425
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,190
You let that dealer, alexandra yee, run her scam

426
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,090
Because she knew about you and mrs. Meier.

427
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,500
Isn't that so?

428
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,600
And she threatened to tell mr. Meier if you fired her.

429
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,700
That's about the size of it, yeah.

430
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,590
Why didn't you tell us you were involved with mrs. Meier

431
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,800
From the start? We were bound to find out. Because it's not pertinent.

432
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,090
Jim knew that ann was out of their relationship

433
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,390
A long time ago.

434
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,700
The two of them came to an understanding.

435
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,290
He was married to his job.

436
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,890
So what me and ann have between us,

437
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,000
It's nobody's business but our own.

438
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,200
Been doing a little work on the place?

439
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,290
No.

440
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,500
Look at this.

441
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,900
You see, the footprints going that way

442
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,400
Are deeper than the footprints coming this way.

443
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,600
Yeah.

444
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,700
Which means someone carried something heavy into your garage,

445
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,600
But they didn't bring it out.

446
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:50,100
Whoo! Look at you. You got some stuff.

447
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,900
Abc

448
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,000
That is nice.

449
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,990
Let's start at 8:00 p.M. The night jim meier was murdered

450
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,600
And stuffed in your fridge.

451
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,290
I called ann from the casino at around 8:00 p.M.

452
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:29,300
When I saw that jim's car was still parked at the resort.

453
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,590
Now that normally meant that he was staying the night,

454
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,090
So we agreed to meet at 12:30 that night.

455
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,690
But you left work at 11:00 p.M.

456
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,890
What did you do with the 90 minutes?

457
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,100
I went home, changed clothes and just relaxed a while

458
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,900
Calida's a small town.

459
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,390
There was plenty of time for you and ann to bash his head in,

460
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,750
Dump the hand and hide the body before going to your hideaway.

461
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,490
I never meet ann at my house.

462
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:52,590
That's very delicate of you. We always met at the piney branch motel.

463
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,990
It's on route 6. That's where we were that night.

464
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,490
The m.E. Says jim was killed sometime between the hours

465
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,690
Of 10:00 p.M. And 1:00 a.M.

466
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:04,590
That's right in the sweet spot of your free time. I didn't kill him.

467
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,890
Was she giving you half of his estate

468
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:09,290
If you made him disappear? I have my own money. I don't need any of jim's.

469
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,190
But you needed his wife. It's not like that.

470
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,090
It's exactly like that. You wanted jim's life,

471
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,790
So you took it out from under him.

472
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:21,290
Look, the last time I saw jim, he was watching his whale tapes.

473
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:24,290
He gets all of his surveillance footage on dvds,

474
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,600
And he watches it night and day,

475
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,690
Trying to figure out what makes them tick,

476
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,090
Keep 'em on the hook.

477
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,590
Jim was obsessed with the casino.

478
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,600
That's what he loved, not ann.

479
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,190
He didn't care what she did.

480
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,590
Lisbon, we got the autopsy report back on meier.

481
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,690
Died of blunt force trauma to the head.

482
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,490
Apparently, he was hit several times

483
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,600
With a heavy cylindrical object like a pipe or a bat.

484
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,590
There were also abrasions around his neck like something

485
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,890
Was ripped off--his $100,000 poker chip,I assume.

486
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,790
Check the piney branch motel

487
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,590
See if ann meier and matt etienne

488
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,800
Were there when he said they were. Okay.

489
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,190
Rigsby, jim meier was spying on his guests,

490
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,690
Kept all the footage on dvd.

491
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,590
Maybe he saw something he shouldn't have.

492
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,100
Go to his office and see if you can locate the footage. Yes, boss.

493
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,700
And check up on jane.

494
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,690
Thank you, darlin'.

495
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,590
You're welcome.

496
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,490
Gentlemen, this is my friend patrick jane,

497
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,300
Come to play some cards with us tonight if everyone's agreeable.

498
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,500
Good to see you. Want a sandwich?

499
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:33,400
Hey, freddy, bring over some sandwiches. Kiss my ass.

500
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,900
Sit down. Sit down.

501
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,790
You want to play, too, danny boy?

502
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,000
Thought I might.

503
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,600
How you feeling, goldilocks? Feeling lucky?

504
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I'm sorry. Are we here to share our feelings or to play cards?

505
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,700
Boom! Watch out, freddy.

506
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,900
Anything over there? I got nada.

507
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,600
We're gonna have to go through these books.

508
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,100
Who are you calling?

509
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,500
Aces and 3s.

510
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,500
Flush wins.

511
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,900
Ah. New girlfriend.

512
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,000
Jane. Ask him how much he's winning.

513
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,400
Not the best timing.

514
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:36,400
Just deal me out of this next hand, please. Oh, we'll wait.

515
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:40,390
What are you doing? Harpooning a whale. Talk fast.

516
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,190
Yeah, we're in meier's work office.

517
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,600
He was watching a surveillance dvd the night he died.

518
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,690
We think it might be in a book, but there's about 500 books.

519
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,190
Are they in any kind of order?

520
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,690
Yeah, there's a lot of military history,

521
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,990
Gaming theory, reference section.

522
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,800
Try the bible or "robert's rules of order." okay, thanks.

523
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:03,190
Hey, how much have you... He didn't say.

524
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,600
Sorry about that. Nice win.

525
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,300
Women.

526
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,300
Yeah, women.

527
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,800
$1,000 to you, sir.

528
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,200
There we go.

529
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,290
I don't care what he says. That man is psychic.

530
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,400
Right.

531
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,600
Room 706. That's cal trask's suite.

532
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,700
I see her. Working girl.

533
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,400
She looks familiar, though.

534
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,200
Why, that's jessica meier, isn't it?

535
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,800
The victim's daughter?

536
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:50,000
Dressed for a party. There's no cake or balloons.

537
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,990
Here's you arriving at trask's hotel suite

538
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,800
At 1:30 in the morning.

539
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:02,000
And here's you leaving 45 minutes later.

540
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,690
Care to comment on that?

541
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,890
No. Where did you get this?

542
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,290
From the way you're dressed,

543
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:12,500
It appears that some sort of sexual transaction took place. No.

544
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,290
Okay, I was guessing. What did take place?

545
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,600
Nothing.

546
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,600
We looked into your financial situation. It's bad.

547
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,290
You and your husband are swimming in credit card debt.

548
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,290
You've refinanced your house three times

549
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,390
In the past two years.

550
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,090
You even had a car repossessed. We hit a rough patch.

551
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,300
Why? Where'd the money go?

552
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,990
Daniel is a professional gambler.

553
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,890
He has his ups and downs, you know,

554
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,600
As in any business.

555
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,490
Jessica, your father was watching this video

556
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,100
The night he died.

557
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,700
Oh, my god.

558
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,800
What does that make you think?

559
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,200
I don't know.

560
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:00,100
Makes me think this video had something to do with his death.

561
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,200
All in.

562
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,200
Call.

563
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,200
Call.

564
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,400
Three 8s.

565
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,000
Full house.

566
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,600
Damn.

567
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,300
Trip 9s. Full house wins.

568
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,200
Sorry, cal.

569
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,000
You got me, kid.

570
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,400
Guess so.

571
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,100
One win each.

572
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,100
You and me are gonna have to play a decider.

573
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,600
Sure thing.

574
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,800
Patrick.

575
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,200
Cal.

576
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,800
Good night, freddy.

577
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,290
Man, we took him for a lot of money.

578
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:15,200
Yes, we did. I took most of it, but you didn't do too bad.

579
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,190
Horse pucky, dude. It was me, skinned him.

580
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,600
Whatever, kid.

581
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,800
Let's go. Heads-up.

582
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,100
Oh, no, no. Rain check for me.

583
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,300
What's the matter, my friend?

584
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,700
You scared?

585
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,700
Open up a fresh pack, nancy, would you?

586
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,490
Cal trask? Hmm?

587
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,090
We're c.B.I. Agents.

588
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,690
Goodfor you. We're investigating the murder of james meier.

589
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,500
We'd like to ask you a few questions.

590
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,690
Ohh. Ask 'em quick. I've been up for 48 hours.

591
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,390
I just lost $180,000.

592
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,000
I need to brush my teeth and go to bed.

593
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,500
Jim was spying on me?

594
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,500
On all his v.I.P. Guests, 24/7.

595
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,900
This is what he was watching the night he died.

596
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,000
Son of a bitch.

597
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,690
Explain for us the nature of your relationship

598
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,500
With jessica meier-cardeira.

599
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,900
It's a large question. Hard to say.

600
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,590
Okay. More specifically, why did she come to your room

601
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,500
In the middle of the night dressed like a hooker?

602
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,000
Think I'll hold my peace on that.

603
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,890
If she has something she wants to tell you, she will, I guess.

604
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,900
We're thinking maybe jim was peeved,

605
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,590
Maybe came to have a word with you

606
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,700
About screwing his only daughter.

607
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:35,000
Maybe things escalated, and maybe you got in a fight.

608
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:39,100
Accidents happen. Your thinking is wrong.

609
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,900
You can see how it looks, though.

610
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:51,800
Okay. Stop the train. I'll get off here.

611
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,390
Night before this happened, I was playing a table stakes game

612
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,300
With daniel, her husband.

613
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:02,300
Man's a degenerate gambler. Degenerate.

614
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,590
Anyway, I cleaned him out, but he wouldn't quit.

615
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,090
Wants to keep playing, but he's got no collateral,

616
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,990
And I don't trust him for an i.O.U.

617
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,300
So he says he'll put up his wife against 50 grand...

618
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,590
The sexual favors of his wife.

619
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,900
As collateral on a poker game? Yep.

620
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,700
So I said sure. I mean, action's action,

621
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:29,500
And jessica meier is a nice piece of pie.

622
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,200
She's very attractive.

623
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:40,800
Anyway, daniel and I play again. Naturally, I beat him again.

624
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,000
He backed his word. I'll give him that.

625
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,590
He said he was gonna send her over to my room the next night,

626
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,800
And he did.

627
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,390
The man's a second-rate card player,

628
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:54,200
But he knows how to control his womenfolk.

629
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,700
She came to your room, and then what? I took what was owed me.

630
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,000
You had sexual intercourse with her?

631
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:03,200
Yeah.

632
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,700
How did she feel about that?

633
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,500
Not super enthusiastic.

634
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,800
Willing...

635
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,300
100% willing...

636
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,900
But not happy.

637
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,100
Hey, a bet's a bet, right?

638
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,490
So I have to win this hand to stay in, huh?

639
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,500
Uh, I guess you do.

640
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,900
Check.

641
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,900
$2,000.

642
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,200
Call.

643
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,700
Excuse me.

644
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,400
I'll take one.

645
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,400
Two. Thank you.

646
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,300
That good, huh?

647
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,900
Oh, wow. That good.

648
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,700
That good.

649
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,600
I can't lose.

650
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,700
Well, it's a shame you got diddly-squat to bet with.

651
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,100
What's the bet, kid?

652
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,700
I forgot.

653
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:07,800
The bet, my friend, is $105,000.

654
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:26,100
$105,000.

655
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,900
And I see you.

656
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,800
You should trust me when I tell you things.

657
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:36,900
I told you I couldn't lose. Four kings. Booyah!

658
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,700
That's pretty.

659
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,400
Not as pretty as this.

660
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,600
Straight flush. No.

661
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,590
Yes. That's impossible.

662
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,800
His pot. That's my pot.

663
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,100
Look at this.

664
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,600
I see you.

665
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,700
Yes, I do.

666
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,700
Whatever, man.

667
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,600
Later.

668
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,800
Not much later.

669
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,400
Let's go.

670
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,790
Tell us, how did you end up

671
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,100
With jim meier's lucky poker chip?

672
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,600
That night, as I was leavin',

673
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,500
Jim followed me to the parking lot.

674
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,190
He'd seen this tape with jessica and cal,

675
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,700
And he knew I must have something to do with it.

676
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,690
I said, sure I did. Screw him.

677
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:57,000
Like he was such a great husband and father, you know?

678
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,790
He called me a degenerate low-life pimp,

679
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,300
Fired me then and there, and he said he'd do everything in his power

680
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,400
To get me out of jessica's life.

681
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,800
I couldn't let that happen.

682
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,390
I remembered the stories they told in the room

683
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,090
About the mafia hit men leaving a hand behind

684
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,500
As a message, you know?

685
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,300
I did it to make 'em think it was mob-related.

686
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,590
I dumped the body at matt's, 'cause I knew

687
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,300
His affair with ann would come to light.

688
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,490
Did your wife have anything to do with this

689
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,300
No. No. She had nothing to do with this.

690
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,300
And the idiot never suspected it was me.

691
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,200
How's that for denial?

692
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,200
She didn't know it was me. How did you know it was me?

693
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,990
Well, when we first met,

694
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,490
You were more concerned about the college football scores

695
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,790
Than you were your father-in-law's murder. So?

696
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,900
So when you're searching for a killer,

697
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,950
The degenerate gambler in the room is a good person to look at.

698
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:51,400
I'm not a degenerate. I'm a professional.

699
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,800
Just having a streak of bad luck.

700
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,600
Yes, you are.

701
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,900
Let's go.

702
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,500
That last hand-- how did you do that?

703
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,700
Stand up. Put your hands behind your head.

704
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:08,490
Oh, uh, I cheated. But how?

705
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,800
Next time we play, I'll show you.

706
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,090
It's okay, baby.

707
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,900
It's gonna be okay.

708
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,100
I believe this is yours.

709
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,000
Thank you.

710
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Your father died protecting you.

711
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,500
So in the end, he...

712
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,400
He was there for you.

713
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,200
Thank you.

714
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,700
Be good to yourself.

715
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,900
You, too.

716
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,300
This way, ladies.

717
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,800
We were wondering how much money you won in that game.

718
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:41,200
Oh, I don't know. $300,000, something like that.

719
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,300
So where is it-- the money?

720
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,100
I spent it.

721
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,300
On what?

722
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,600
You know, stuff.

723
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,700
A really cute blonde guy left this for you at the front desk.

724
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,660
Oh, my god!
