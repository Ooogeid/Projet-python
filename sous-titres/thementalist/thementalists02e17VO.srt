1
00:00:01,096 --> 00:00:02,630
Her name's Madeleine Hightower.

2
00:00:02,755 --> 00:00:04,839
She's been running
intelligence down in Fresno.

3
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:07,738
- New boss?
- Yes. Madeleine Hightower.

4
00:00:07,983 --> 00:00:10,832
Chief Deputy AG
says she'll be here sometime tomorrow.

5
00:00:10,957 --> 00:00:14,255
Word is she's hard as nails...
Political, tight statehouse connections.

6
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,797
This is good for us.
We'll have some real muscle upstairs.

7
00:00:16,922 --> 00:00:17,922
We'll see.

8
00:00:18,983 --> 00:00:20,519
No need to be nervous.

9
00:00:20,644 --> 00:00:22,754
- I'm not nervous.
- You're an exemplary agent.

10
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:25,478
- No reason for butterflies.
- No butterflies.

11
00:00:25,603 --> 00:00:27,853
- I'm fine.
- Keep telling yourself that.

12
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:35,082
HOPPER BANKS ESTATE
CITRUS HEIGHTS, CALIFORNIA

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,793
How are you doing?

14
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:46,588
Vic Bandino,
Alpha Bravo residential security.

15
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:49,617
- Appreciate your quick response.
- Agent Lisbon. This is Patrick Jane.

16
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:51,240
Wayne Rigsby.

17
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:53,177
CBI, you did okay.

18
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:55,855
Hi, Bandino. What's up?
We worked a couple of cases

19
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,224
together back in the day.
San Diego PD

20
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,643
- Arson squad.
- Those were the times, huh?

21
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:01,936
Remember in Pismo?

22
00:01:02,252 --> 00:01:04,956
- You ever call that chick?
- Would you show us the body?

23
00:01:06,254 --> 00:01:07,692
Yes, of course. Please.

24
00:01:08,346 --> 00:01:09,774
He's in the pool house.

25
00:01:09,899 --> 00:01:12,599
Name's James Smithson.
28, British citizen.

26
00:01:13,228 --> 00:01:15,557
He's a high-priced tutor
for local kids.

27
00:01:16,278 --> 00:01:18,499
Daughter of the homeowner's
one of the students.

28
00:01:18,624 --> 00:01:20,850
Couple months ago
they let him move in here.

29
00:01:20,975 --> 00:01:23,281
Can you find out
why the coroner's not here?

30
00:01:29,902 --> 00:01:31,573
Who found the body? You?

31
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:34,431
The homeowner's kid.
She was coming in for a lesson.

32
00:01:34,556 --> 00:01:36,540
She called her dad.
He called me. I called you.

33
00:01:36,665 --> 00:01:38,853
- Not the local police?
- Why us?

34
00:01:38,978 --> 00:01:39,932
What the hell?

35
00:01:40,635 --> 00:01:43,060
- You were supposed to call me.
- Excuse me?

36
00:01:43,483 --> 00:01:45,855
- I'm Hopper Banks.
- Agent Lisbon, CBI.

37
00:01:46,245 --> 00:01:48,232
- This is a crime scene.
- It's my place.

38
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,550
I need you to leave.
Can you do that for me?

39
00:01:54,272 --> 00:01:56,866
I'll be in the main house.
I'll expect a full report.

40
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:59,059
Let me know
when you get the body out of here.

41
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:02,919
That's why I called you.

42
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:04,844
Old California money, lots of clout.

43
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:07,296
Local PD won't cut it.
He wants the best.

44
00:02:07,421 --> 00:02:08,868
Coroner's on his way.

45
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:11,422
A single gunshot.
Judging by the wound,

46
00:02:11,652 --> 00:02:13,299
looks like a 38.
No weapon.

47
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,699
Don't worry.

48
00:02:14,824 --> 00:02:17,161
It's a visual inspection.
Didn't touch a thing.

49
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:19,305
No sign of assault?

50
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:22,683
Real fancy resume, this guy.

51
00:02:24,063 --> 00:02:26,812
Graduated from Eton and Oxford.
Last employer

52
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,231
was some hotshot
prep school back east.

53
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,816
I wouldn't be so sure.

54
00:02:31,231 --> 00:02:32,651
- Excuse me?
- The facial scar.

55
00:02:33,351 --> 00:02:34,653
Eton boy gets a cut

56
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,541
on his head, and he needs
a plastic surgeon, he gets it.

57
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,451
My guess, the whole resume
is a fairy tale.

58
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:42,301
- Excuse me?
- You're excused.

59
00:02:42,426 --> 00:02:43,996
I checked him out myself.

60
00:02:45,077 --> 00:02:46,327
I'm wrong then.

61
00:02:49,411 --> 00:02:50,795
No blisters or calluses

62
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:53,255
on his hands.
A lot of dirt under his fingernails.

63
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,736
- Who is this guy?
- It's a long story.

64
00:02:56,558 --> 00:02:57,758
Anything else?

65
00:02:58,428 --> 00:02:59,762
This place must be alarmed.

66
00:03:00,027 --> 00:03:02,738
Family never turn it on.
I got the call at 3:35.

67
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,266
I was at a client's

68
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,227
residence nearby,
working an alarm upgrade.

69
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:09,568
Arrived here at 3:52.

70
00:03:10,995 --> 00:03:12,191
Body was still warm,

71
00:03:13,471 --> 00:03:15,903
I guess the time of death
was a good hour before that.

72
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:18,864
- What the hell.
- Guess again.

73
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,376
2x17
<i>The Red Box</i>

74
00:03:37,573 --> 00:03:39,332
It's called Lazarus syndrome.

75
00:03:39,457 --> 00:03:42,203
Guy's heart somehow caught
an electrical charge and restarted.

76
00:03:42,328 --> 00:03:43,222
It happens.

77
00:03:43,597 --> 00:03:44,965
You're saying he's alive?

78
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,215
If you can call that living.
He's brain-dead.

79
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,776
No oxygen for more 10 minutes,
he's not coming back.

80
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:52,870
There's security cameras out there.
Have Bandino show you the footage.

81
00:03:52,995 --> 00:03:55,437
Maybe we'll get lucky
and catch a look at the shooter.

82
00:03:55,562 --> 00:03:56,819
I need to talk to the girl

83
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:58,747
- who found the body.
- You got it.

84
00:04:08,851 --> 00:04:10,165
What are you looking for?

85
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:13,798
The dirt under his nails
smelled like rosemary.

86
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:30,906
Whatever was inside this box
killed our man.

87
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:36,122
- The case is practically closed.
- There's no reason to be snarky.

88
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:40,291
It was my wife Jolene, really.

89
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,824
She saw how much James
helped Lanie with her schoolwork.

90
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,440
She heard he needed a place to live,
she rented the pool house to him.

91
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,221
I guess he's been here...

92
00:04:50,776 --> 00:04:52,247
A couple of months, maybe.

93
00:04:52,372 --> 00:04:55,305
- Very generous of your wife.
- Jolene has a big heart.

94
00:04:56,747 --> 00:04:57,847
Is this her?

95
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,771
- My muse.
- Good-looking.

96
00:05:02,358 --> 00:05:03,928
She turned me into a real artist.

97
00:05:05,048 --> 00:05:07,097
Before I met her,
I was taking snapshots.

98
00:05:08,221 --> 00:05:10,601
We're gonna need
to talk to your daughter.

99
00:05:11,683 --> 00:05:14,596
I'm sorry. Lanie's too upset
to talk at the moment.

100
00:05:14,721 --> 00:05:15,898
Please. Maybe later.

101
00:05:16,529 --> 00:05:19,193
- We need that her memory's fresh.
- She saw what you saw.

102
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:21,570
She went to the pool house
for some homework help.

103
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,534
- We have to hear that from her.
- And she found a dead body.

104
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:26,700
She's 12 years old.
Don't you get it?

105
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,327
It's not homework.

106
00:05:29,086 --> 00:05:31,141
It's a project about the pyramids.

107
00:05:32,197 --> 00:05:33,290
I can talk to you.

108
00:05:33,578 --> 00:05:35,814
- Thanks.
- Sit right here, sweetie.

109
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,257
I'm Agent Lisbon and Patrick Jane.

110
00:05:42,766 --> 00:05:43,509
Hi.

111
00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:45,928
What do you have to do
for your project?

112
00:05:46,197 --> 00:05:49,848
Describe the afterlife as depicted
in the ancient Egyptian mythology.

113
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:53,940


114
00:05:54,065 --> 00:05:55,354
Did you know

115
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:58,649
that they believed
that when you die,

116
00:05:59,876 --> 00:06:01,485
you are carried into the next life

117
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:04,446
on the back of a sacred hippopotamus?
That's true.

118
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:07,535
What time
did you get home from school?

119
00:06:07,816 --> 00:06:09,952
- A little after 3:00.
- What did you do?

120
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,090
I made lemonade.

121
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,123
James loves my lemonade.

122
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,666
Who else was home?

123
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:17,835
Nobody. I was at the gallery,

124
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:19,725
- and Jolene was at the gym.
- Please.

125
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,005
No one was here.

126
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,927
I took the lemonade
to the pool house.

127
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,220
I saw...

128
00:06:30,503 --> 00:06:31,598
so much blood.

129
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:37,271
Did you see anybody
or hear anything? Voices, a car?

130
00:06:38,349 --> 00:06:39,356
Just James.

131
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:42,856
- I'm taking her upstairs.
- Does anybody know what was this?

132
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:45,404
No. Are we through?

133
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:46,572
Almost.

134
00:06:47,089 --> 00:06:49,281
Why didn't your mother
want you to speak to us?

135
00:06:49,406 --> 00:06:50,617
She's not my mother.

136
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,245
Honey, it's okay.

137
00:06:53,838 --> 00:06:55,310
I was protecting her.

138
00:06:55,697 --> 00:06:57,967
She's been through
a very traumatic experience.

139
00:06:59,221 --> 00:07:01,279
I thought you were worried
she'd say something

140
00:07:01,404 --> 00:07:03,255
about what you try to hide from us.

141
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,095
- How dare you?
- Really?

142
00:07:05,837 --> 00:07:06,887
How dare I?

143
00:07:07,607 --> 00:07:09,219
It's the best comeback you've got?

144
00:07:11,634 --> 00:07:13,974
- You're gonna let this man insult me?
- Huh?

145
00:07:14,622 --> 00:07:16,774
Stand with your mouth open
like a moron.

146
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:17,853
Baby.

147
00:07:18,601 --> 00:07:19,601
Baby.

148
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:21,310
Really?

149
00:07:22,432 --> 00:07:23,358
Well played.

150
00:07:25,062 --> 00:07:25,986
I'm starving.

151
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,224
We've got four cameras
in the backyard.

152
00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:30,369
We ran the footage from sunup
till we got here.

153
00:07:30,494 --> 00:07:31,450
Check this out.

154
00:07:32,612 --> 00:07:35,788
We found this at 2:37.
Watch the window. It's a muzzle flash.

155
00:07:36,092 --> 00:07:37,956
Who's in there?
What camera had the door?

156
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,188
- This is the only image we've got.
- Nobody coming in, out or in the yard?

157
00:07:41,313 --> 00:07:42,764
Whoever shot Smithson knew

158
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:45,339
where those cameras were placed
and how to avoid 'em.

159
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:49,718
This one's mine.

160
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,637
If you want one,
I can make one for you.

161
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:55,140
We need to check
Jolene and Hopper's alibis.

162
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,877
You know, hold on a second.

163
00:07:57,002 --> 00:07:59,449
None of these cameras are hidden.
Anyone can see them.

164
00:07:59,706 --> 00:08:01,605
Guests,
students coming here for tutoring,

165
00:08:02,094 --> 00:08:03,565
their parents, everybody.

166
00:08:04,286 --> 00:08:06,985
- Good point.
- Thanks for your time.

167
00:08:08,925 --> 00:08:09,925
Thank you.

168
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,120
Cheers.

169
00:08:12,245 --> 00:08:14,034
The victim, James Smithson,
doesn't exist.

170
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:17,535
Passport's fake.
His references are bogus.

171
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,988
I ran his prints through databases.
There's nothing, nothing at all.

172
00:08:22,392 --> 00:08:24,900
Your friend Bandino
didn't do much of a background check.

173
00:08:25,025 --> 00:08:26,492
That's not like him.

174
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:29,104
Not the sharpest knife,
but he always did the legwork.

175
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:31,818
You think he's holding
something back, protecting his clients?

176
00:08:31,943 --> 00:08:33,595
- I'll check it out.
- Take Van Pelt.

177
00:08:38,656 --> 00:08:40,088
Just stop worrying.

178
00:08:40,213 --> 00:08:41,851
It will be fine with the new boss.

179
00:08:41,976 --> 00:08:43,897
There'll be a settling-in period

180
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:46,221
when she probes
your psyche for weakness,

181
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:47,985
- But once...
- Would you stop?

182
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:51,280
You're being so childish.
You're the one who's nervous.

183
00:08:52,297 --> 00:08:54,637
That sounds perceptive.
Let me think about that.

184
00:08:56,601 --> 00:08:59,231
No. I find that I'm not.
It's definitely you.

185
00:08:59,514 --> 00:09:02,022
I'll talk to Smithson's
regular students and their parents,

186
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,934
- fill in some blanks.
- Good idea. Take him with you.

187
00:09:05,059 --> 00:09:06,059
Come on.

188
00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:10,048
My God. It's so terrible.

189
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:13,760
- You have any idea who did it?
- We're still investigating.

190
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:17,927
The parents and students we've talked
to all say he was a great tutor,

191
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:21,110
but not much else.
How well did you know Mr. Smithson?

192
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:22,672
Not that well.

193
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:25,439
James had only been
tutoring my son for...

194
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:27,691
three...

195
00:09:28,632 --> 00:09:29,651
four months.

196
00:09:30,409 --> 00:09:32,009
I'd drop off, pick up.

197
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,239
Say hello.

198
00:09:35,268 --> 00:09:37,624
- He seemed nice.
- Excuse me, Mrs. Blankman.

199
00:09:37,749 --> 00:09:39,818
I'm sorry. Don't mean to interrupt.

200
00:09:39,943 --> 00:09:42,915
I'm a little parched.
Could I bother you for a cup of tea?

201
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,833
I'm sorry. I didn't offer you...

202
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,238
No, no, please. I can get it.
You're shaking.

203
00:09:47,363 --> 00:09:48,545
You'd like a cup?

204
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:50,902
No, thanks.

205
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:35,634
Your son never mentioned anything?
Money problems?

206
00:10:35,876 --> 00:10:37,226
Anything unusual?

207
00:10:37,576 --> 00:10:38,858
They just studied.

208
00:10:39,132 --> 00:10:41,598
Smelled so good,
I went and made you one.

209
00:10:43,426 --> 00:10:45,016
Lemongrass, my favorite.

210
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:47,449
It's funny how smells work.

211
00:10:47,574 --> 00:10:50,119
They attach themselves
to such specific memories.

212
00:10:51,587 --> 00:10:53,335
Like the kitchen
of a childhood home,

213
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:56,026
or having a cup of tea with a lover.

214
00:11:03,588 --> 00:11:05,122
Yes, you and James were lovers.

215
00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:13,255
You might not want to drink that.
That's a little...

216
00:11:13,475 --> 00:11:14,589
funky monkey.

217
00:11:16,535 --> 00:11:18,577
What kind of background check
did you do?

218
00:11:18,702 --> 00:11:20,768
The usual.
I called his last employer,

219
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:23,463
- checked his credit.
- James Smithson isn't him.

220
00:11:23,588 --> 00:11:24,852
None of it's true.

221
00:11:25,789 --> 00:11:28,626
There's a limit to what I can do.
I'm not the CIA.

222
00:11:28,751 --> 00:11:31,218
Come on.
You used to be more gung-ho than that.

223
00:11:31,685 --> 00:11:33,991
That's why I'm not a cop anymore.
It's too stressful.

224
00:11:34,116 --> 00:11:36,445
- Unhealthy profession.
- No kidding.

225
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:38,047
You got anything?

226
00:11:39,218 --> 00:11:41,752
Seriously,
you hear about Hank Harrison?

227
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:44,193
39 years old,
5 years out from his pension...

228
00:11:44,318 --> 00:11:46,444
Boom. Heart attack.
A wife, two kids.

229
00:11:46,569 --> 00:11:48,373
He had that bachelor party,
remember?

230
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:51,657
Come on. Sure you do.

231
00:11:51,957 --> 00:11:54,111
The stripper was all over his case.

232
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,214
I bet she was.

233
00:12:00,308 --> 00:12:02,480
Are you two, like...
Are you dating each other?

234
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,389
- No, we're not.
- No?

235
00:12:04,761 --> 00:12:06,266
Because you both looked weird.

236
00:12:07,864 --> 00:12:09,353
We're talking about a murder.

237
00:12:12,439 --> 00:12:15,093
I'm sorry, all right?
There is one thing.

238
00:12:15,697 --> 00:12:18,245
A couple months ago,
Hopper was working on this photo thing.

239
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:20,614
He asked me a gun.

240
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:24,222
Old-fashioned piece, like the FBI
was using in some '60s movie he saw.

241
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:25,494
Like a 38?

242
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,621
I guess. We never got to that.

243
00:12:28,318 --> 00:12:31,080
I turned him down. If he wanted it
like the movie, get a prop gun.

244
00:12:31,205 --> 00:12:33,168
I don't know what he did
in the end, but

245
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,087
- it's worth mentioning?
- It is.

246
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,421
Thanks. Appreciate it.

247
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,547
Absolutely.

248
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,010
Thanks for your help.

249
00:12:39,135 --> 00:12:40,962
- No problem.
- Hey, listen.

250
00:12:41,288 --> 00:12:43,621
What say you and me
go get a cup of coffee some time?

251
00:12:43,746 --> 00:12:44,746
No, thanks.

252
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:48,155
What's coffee?
I'm a nice guy, right, Rigs?

253
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,549
See ya later.

254
00:12:51,978 --> 00:12:53,563
Smithson was a big ladies' man,

255
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,133
they've both got alibis.

256
00:12:55,258 --> 00:12:57,870
Maggie's husband's been
in Reno for the last three days,

257
00:12:57,995 --> 00:13:01,136
Maggie was at a therapist's session
from 2:00 to 4:00 pm, double session.

258
00:13:01,261 --> 00:13:03,323
Jane and I are gonna go
to Hopper's gallery,

259
00:13:03,448 --> 00:13:04,791
ask about the gun.

260
00:13:13,096 --> 00:13:14,209
Want a coffee?

261
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,460
No, thanks.

262
00:13:17,786 --> 00:13:18,880
What was her name?

263
00:13:19,834 --> 00:13:21,573
- Who?
- The stripper.

264
00:13:24,668 --> 00:13:26,035
We could double date,

265
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,410
me and Bandino,

266
00:13:27,642 --> 00:13:29,099
you and your stripper.

267
00:13:31,085 --> 00:13:32,102
I thought you...

268
00:13:35,942 --> 00:13:37,042
That's mean.

269
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,233
Kidding.

270
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:41,197
Her name was Kandy.

271
00:13:41,685 --> 00:13:43,280
Sweet Kandy, with a "K."

272
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,350
Kandy with a "K."

273
00:13:50,694 --> 00:13:51,759
Do I own a gun?

274
00:13:51,884 --> 00:13:53,737
Yes, Mr. Banks, a 38.

275
00:13:53,862 --> 00:13:56,492
Have you ever been
in possession of one or owned one?

276
00:13:56,617 --> 00:13:58,778
I never had a gun.
Any kind.

277
00:13:58,903 --> 00:14:00,603
I don't believe in them.

278
00:14:01,414 --> 00:14:03,517
You're just not trying hard enough.

279
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:04,642
I am.

280
00:14:05,007 --> 00:14:06,470
You just can't read minds.

281
00:14:07,586 --> 00:14:09,014
You close your eyes.

282
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,282
I'm the boss here.
Concentrate.

283
00:14:12,801 --> 00:14:14,811
It's coming to me.
Chocolate?

284
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,689
Coconut.

285
00:14:18,366 --> 00:14:19,366
Swirl.

286
00:14:21,267 --> 00:14:22,181
Vanilla.

287
00:14:22,306 --> 00:14:23,111
Pay up.

288
00:14:24,334 --> 00:14:25,489
That's not funny.

289
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:26,657
It is.

290
00:14:27,147 --> 00:14:28,909
Dad, just getting ice cream.

291
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,412
Would you mind taking
a polygraph test?

292
00:14:33,204 --> 00:14:34,551
Why would I do that?

293
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,824
I'll give you this,
you have a very consistent vision.

294
00:14:38,531 --> 00:14:40,528
A crazy, but consistent.

295
00:14:42,809 --> 00:14:45,592
I wouldn't expect you
to understand what I'm doing.

296
00:14:45,924 --> 00:14:47,135
Let me give it a shot.

297
00:14:47,957 --> 00:14:50,911
You enjoy
taking possession of your wife,

298
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:54,726
but only on camera, not in the flesh.
You're being cuckolded by Smithson,

299
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:57,692
and you let it happen.
Why?

300
00:14:57,817 --> 00:14:58,817
Impotence?

301
00:14:59,439 --> 00:15:00,315
Masochism?

302
00:15:01,272 --> 00:15:02,275
Homosexuality?

303
00:15:03,554 --> 00:15:04,528
I'm not sure.

304
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:07,864
That's very perceptive, Mr. Jane.
You have a talent.

305
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:10,492
I do. Thanks.

306
00:15:11,675 --> 00:15:12,869
It's an easy call.

307
00:15:14,219 --> 00:15:15,585
You're very attractive,

308
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:16,760
but unhappy

309
00:15:16,997 --> 00:15:19,179
and accustomed to using your sexuality
as a weapon.

310
00:15:19,304 --> 00:15:22,065
Did you use your sexuality
as a weapon against him?

311
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:23,605
You're done.

312
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:24,736
Now...

313
00:15:24,861 --> 00:15:25,757
Go.

314
00:15:26,954 --> 00:15:28,426
What does it take to get you mad?

315
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,428
Did Smithson rub your nose in it?

316
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,556
- That's ridiculous!
- What's wrong?

317
00:15:33,787 --> 00:15:36,226
Nothing, honey.
These people were just leaving.

318
00:15:36,593 --> 00:15:38,493
- We should leave.
- Let's.

319
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,005
- How's the ice cream?
- Good.

320
00:15:41,546 --> 00:15:43,096
Hard to beat vanilla.

321
00:15:48,137 --> 00:15:49,445
I know, I know.

322
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,675
You were making stuff up
to get the guy angry

323
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,331
so you could get a read on him.
Blah, blah, blah.

324
00:15:54,456 --> 00:15:56,371
The truth is,
you didn't like the guy.

325
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,498
That'd be very unprofessional.

326
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,976
Could you take the next left,
please?

327
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,008
What did you read?
Did he do it?

328
00:16:08,466 --> 00:16:09,968
Take the next left, I'll tell you.

329
00:16:16,388 --> 00:16:17,976
- Well?
- Well, maybe.

330
00:16:18,223 --> 00:16:19,773
He had a good motive.

331
00:16:20,031 --> 00:16:22,481
And maybe not.
The red box didn't fit.

332
00:16:23,231 --> 00:16:24,357
You picked up a tail?

333
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:29,321
<i>Cul-de-sac.</i>

334
00:16:46,117 --> 00:16:47,117
Nothing.

335
00:16:49,492 --> 00:16:50,492
You sure?

336
00:17:05,493 --> 00:17:06,493
Excuse me.

337
00:17:07,964 --> 00:17:09,498
Why are you following us?

338
00:17:09,623 --> 00:17:10,823
Following you?

339
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,990
Shoot,
I thought California was friendly.

340
00:17:14,614 --> 00:17:17,077
I'm just trying to make a sale here,
life insurance.

341
00:17:17,758 --> 00:17:20,767
Cute young couple like yourselves,
you've gotta think about the future.

342
00:17:21,204 --> 00:17:22,554
You got kids yet?

343
00:17:23,937 --> 00:17:25,651
That's a terrible accent.

344
00:17:25,776 --> 00:17:27,426
Disguised British, yes?

345
00:17:27,678 --> 00:17:28,755
You gotta work

346
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:30,765
- on your glottal stop.
- His what?

347
00:17:31,037 --> 00:17:32,092
His glottal stop.

348
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,219
Can we see some identification,
please?

349
00:17:35,303 --> 00:17:36,692
Sure. It's in the car.

350
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:39,268
- Hold on, I'll get it.
- Put your hands on the car.

351
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:40,393
Now.

352
00:17:42,635 --> 00:17:43,728
What's this about?

353
00:17:44,068 --> 00:17:45,168
Turn around.

354
00:17:46,835 --> 00:17:48,625
A stranger asks to see your ID,

355
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,819
you ask them
to show you theirs first.

356
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:53,947
Unless, of course,
you're trying to hide something.

357
00:17:56,063 --> 00:17:57,163
Quite right.

358
00:17:57,774 --> 00:17:58,785
Quite right.

359
00:17:59,481 --> 00:18:00,370
Who are you?

360
00:18:01,489 --> 00:18:02,622
Francis Slocombe.

361
00:18:03,347 --> 00:18:06,501
Inspector Francis Slocombe.
Scotland Yard Special Branch.

362
00:18:12,873 --> 00:18:13,873
Thank you.

363
00:18:15,075 --> 00:18:17,055
I can't reach your contact
at Scotland Yard.

364
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,205
Time difference.
Tricky one, that.

365
00:18:19,605 --> 00:18:21,840
Francis Slocombe,
registered at the Flamingo Motel.

366
00:18:21,965 --> 00:18:23,665
- Where's Jane?
- Here.

367
00:18:23,893 --> 00:18:25,831
Thanks.
Did you check Liverpool's score?

368
00:18:25,956 --> 00:18:28,734
- Up 1-nothing. End of the first half.
- Excellent.

369
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:30,898
- Where are the sandwiches?
- I'm being nice to him,

370
00:18:31,023 --> 00:18:32,944
because I think he might know
what was in this.

371
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,072
What about our search warrant
that got killed? For the murder weapon?

372
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,759
- You're not even curious?
- After your show at the gallery,

373
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:41,327
Banks made some calls.
Judge Withers won't sign the warrant.

374
00:18:42,206 --> 00:18:44,456
Sorry, she's a little cranky.
New boss coming in.

375
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:45,790
Enough with that.

376
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:47,751
- Did his story check out?
- Nope.

377
00:18:48,355 --> 00:18:49,905
About James Smithson,

378
00:18:50,331 --> 00:18:51,921
his real name's Oliver Stans.

379
00:18:52,349 --> 00:18:54,466
Nine months ago
he stole a very valuable artifact

380
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:55,967
from the British Museum.

381
00:18:56,392 --> 00:18:58,614
A pristine example
of greco-roman art

382
00:18:58,739 --> 00:19:00,013
circa 50 B.C.

383
00:19:00,248 --> 00:19:01,181
A wedding ring,

384
00:19:01,605 --> 00:19:03,244
said to belong to Cleopatra,

385
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,220
given her by Mark Antony.

386
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:06,978
That's what was in the box.

387
00:19:09,476 --> 00:19:10,398
Here's a copy

388
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,358
from the museum...

389
00:19:12,738 --> 00:19:13,738
gift shop.

390
00:19:14,538 --> 00:19:17,030
Stans lifted the ring
and replaced it with one of those.

391
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,190
What was he doing in the USA?

392
00:19:21,955 --> 00:19:23,976
He knew we were building
a case against him.

393
00:19:24,101 --> 00:19:25,800
Changed his name, disappeared.

394
00:19:25,925 --> 00:19:27,975
A week ago we picked up chatter

395
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:31,377
that a dealer in stolen antiquities
was gonna buy the ring here,

396
00:19:31,613 --> 00:19:33,265
had sent someone to pick it up.

397
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:35,507
May I?

398
00:19:39,968 --> 00:19:41,513
This is Louis Anglet...

399
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,891
go to courier
in the high-end stolen art market.

400
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,705
I followed him here
to Stans and the ring,

401
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,480
but I arrived too late.

402
00:19:49,726 --> 00:19:51,325
That's why I was following you.

403
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:52,649
Anglet has the ring,

404
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,818
I need to get back on the trail.

405
00:19:55,197 --> 00:19:57,529
You're not going anywhere
until your story checks out.

406
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,906
Whoever killed Stans
killed him for the ring.

407
00:20:00,936 --> 00:20:03,454
Ron, take Mr. Slocombe
to an interrogation room.

408
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:06,120
- Sit on him while I make a call.
- Sure.

409
00:20:09,221 --> 00:20:10,221
Let's go.

410
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:17,017
Slocombe's right.
James Smithson is Oliver Stans.

411
00:20:17,566 --> 00:20:20,593
A few minor arrests...
narcotics possession charge, assault.

412
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:22,912
Looks like a bar fight.

413
00:20:23,412 --> 00:20:26,057
And yes, a person of interesting
the British Museum theft.

414
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,141
A next of kin?

415
00:20:28,055 --> 00:20:31,067
The hospital called. They need someone
to sign off on organ donation.

416
00:20:32,484 --> 00:20:35,817
Stans' mother was a single parent.
Died three years ago. No siblings.

417
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,757
Come. We need to ask
Slocombe some questions.

418
00:20:44,669 --> 00:20:46,694
- His gun's gone.
- I'll get a search started.

419
00:20:46,819 --> 00:20:47,871
Can you hear me?

420
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:52,279
FBI says he's Scotland Yard,

421
00:20:52,404 --> 00:20:54,794
but he's got nothing
to do with this case.

422
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:58,250
When the ring was lifted,
he went off the reservation.

423
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:00,675
He's been tracking Stans ever since.

424
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:05,013
He helped with the robbery,
and Stans double-crossed him?

425
00:21:05,937 --> 00:21:07,890
Slocombe's just
trying to get the ring back.

426
00:21:09,084 --> 00:21:11,102
"Why?" Is the big question.

427
00:21:11,709 --> 00:21:13,980
Go to his motel room.
See if you can find anything

428
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:15,748
there that'll help us.

429
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,404
No sign of Slocombe.
I got a grid search started.

430
00:21:22,094 --> 00:21:24,094
This is perfect. It's perfect.

431
00:21:31,049 --> 00:21:32,248
Madeleine Hightower.

432
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:34,208
Special agent Hightower, welcome.

433
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,586
This is Patrick Jane.

434
00:21:37,704 --> 00:21:39,255
The famous Mr. Jane.

435
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:42,592
Good to meet you.

436
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,718
You, too.

437
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:47,305
I'd have a nice, quiet day today,
but it seems like there's trouble.

438
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,849
We lost somebody.

439
00:21:52,392 --> 00:21:53,603
We're looking for him.

440
00:21:54,664 --> 00:21:56,230
Then I'm sure you'll found him.

441
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:00,124
Let's talk in my office.

442
00:22:00,249 --> 00:22:02,124
Give me a half-hour
to roll some calls.

443
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,816
She likes you. I can tell.

444
00:22:20,447 --> 00:22:22,047
I've stayed in worse places.

445
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,650
That's shocking.

446
00:22:27,884 --> 00:22:29,681
That is a good bed for a motel room.

447
00:22:29,967 --> 00:22:30,979
Very firm.

448
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:34,560
You wanna try it?

449
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,178
- Come on.
- What?

450
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,273
We can lock the door.
Nobody's looking.

451
00:22:39,955 --> 00:22:40,955
Come on.

452
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:42,193
We're on duty.

453
00:22:43,175 --> 00:22:45,031
I know. Totally wrong.

454
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:48,908
Come on.

455
00:22:54,931 --> 00:22:56,240
Hold that thought.

456
00:23:01,323 --> 00:23:02,380
What you got?

457
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:04,799
Eureka.

458
00:23:05,615 --> 00:23:07,926
Eureka. Is that mean
you can get back here?

459
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:10,567
- This could be critical evidence.
- It could be,

460
00:23:10,692 --> 00:23:12,682
but unless
the critical evidence self-destructs.

461
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:16,894
In less than ten seconds,
I suggest you get yourself back here.

462
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,090
It's critical.

463
00:23:22,415 --> 00:23:23,415
Fine.

464
00:23:36,503 --> 00:23:38,055
Room's good. Thank you.

465
00:23:42,222 --> 00:23:43,222
Come in.

466
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:52,508
I assure you, today's incident
is not at all indicative

467
00:23:52,633 --> 00:23:54,820
of the unit's overall confidence.

468
00:23:56,199 --> 00:23:58,350
You had a bad day, agent Lisbon.

469
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:00,897
You screwed up.

470
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:02,482
It happens.

471
00:24:03,327 --> 00:24:04,927
Let's get to the work.

472
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,555
This judge,
the one who changed his mind

473
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,073
- about giving us our search warrant...
- Judge Withers.

474
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:14,885
He's kinda like a stubborn old bull,
won't budge once he takes a position.

475
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:16,010
He tried.

476
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,706
He changed his mind because...

477
00:24:19,676 --> 00:24:21,890
He said we hadn't met the threshold.

478
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:23,642
Not what he said.

479
00:24:24,118 --> 00:24:25,418
The real reason.

480
00:24:28,976 --> 00:24:30,301
Patrick Jane insulted Banks,

481
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:32,440
and Banks complained.

482
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:35,139
- Jane has unusual methods...
- He closes cases,

483
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,683
yes, he does. He's a valuable asset.
We cannot afford

484
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:38,851
to lose him.

485
00:24:40,023 --> 00:24:41,400
The way I see it...

486
00:24:43,239 --> 00:24:44,816
It's you that's in a tricky spot.

487
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,110
Ma'am?

488
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,821
This bureau has seen
some tough times lately.

489
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:54,061
My mission is to turn that around
and make the CBI the premier

490
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:56,102
law enforcement agency
in this state.

491
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,789
Patrick Jane is a huge
part of that goal.

492
00:25:04,356 --> 00:25:06,356
If you can't keep him in line,

493
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,831
we'll find someone who can.

494
00:25:13,916 --> 00:25:14,966
You can go.

495
00:25:16,757 --> 00:25:19,447
I'll give Judge Withers a call,
get you a warrant.

496
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:26,135
According to the information
Slocombe dug up,

497
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,845
Louis Anglet doesn't just deal
in stolen antiquities.

498
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:30,885
He's a hired gun, never indicted,

499
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:33,042
but a prime suspect
in three killings.

500
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:35,151
And he hasn't left the country.
He's still here.

501
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,482
Multiple ID, multiple arrests,
but no jail time.

502
00:25:37,607 --> 00:25:39,549
He's a slippery customer.
He looks good for it.

503
00:25:39,674 --> 00:25:41,958
We don't know where Anglet is.
What we do know

504
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:44,533
is that every time Slocombe
opens his mouth, he lies.

505
00:25:44,658 --> 00:25:45,960
We've got a bolo out on him.

506
00:25:46,291 --> 00:25:49,088
In the meantime, let's just pursue
the case we're developing.

507
00:25:49,441 --> 00:25:52,758
Banks is still our prime suspect.
Let's check out his house for the gun.

508
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,344
- We don't have a search warrant.
- We do now.

509
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:58,500
Hightower got Withers
to sign off on it.

510
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,423
Did you find anything? If you did,
I hope you keep my name out of it...

511
00:26:03,548 --> 00:26:04,548
Go away.

512
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:07,474
Nothing so far.
I got some more guys coming.

513
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,585
Agent Lisbon,
what is the CBI equivalent of Siberia?

514
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:12,243
Because that's where you're going.

515
00:26:12,368 --> 00:26:16,157
- Hold that thought, Mr. Banks.
- Look what I found in the home office.

516
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:18,303
- It's a picture of a prop.
- It's a colt,

517
00:26:18,428 --> 00:26:20,427
detective special,
38 caliber, 4-inch barrel.

518
00:26:20,552 --> 00:26:22,872
- Same kind of gun killed our victim.
- A prop.

519
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,583
Why don't we sort out which one
at our offices?

520
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,180
Oliver, you idiot.

521
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,820
You bloody idiot.

522
00:26:46,061 --> 00:26:47,111
Who's that?

523
00:26:47,938 --> 00:26:49,190
Come out or I'll shoot.

524
00:26:56,721 --> 00:26:57,814
I checked for you.

525
00:26:58,398 --> 00:26:59,648
Liverpool lost.

526
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,425
Bad season?

527
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:04,159
Injuries.

528
00:27:06,517 --> 00:27:07,985
You're expecting me, then?

529
00:27:08,547 --> 00:27:09,460
Nice work.

530
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,071
You dropped everything, you...

531
00:27:12,915 --> 00:27:13,915
risked your

532
00:27:14,393 --> 00:27:15,928
whole career to...

533
00:27:16,764 --> 00:27:18,719
find him before your colleagues
at the Yard.

534
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,669
You followed us after he was shot.

535
00:27:20,913 --> 00:27:22,615
You're both Liverpool fans.

536
00:27:24,026 --> 00:27:25,142
He's family.

537
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:27,395
Your son?

538
00:27:31,701 --> 00:27:32,701
My son.

539
00:27:36,833 --> 00:27:38,483
I was no father to him.

540
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,798
Never married his mother.

541
00:27:43,097 --> 00:27:45,157
Never spent time
with him at all, really.

542
00:27:48,122 --> 00:27:49,336
But I kept track.

543
00:27:49,789 --> 00:27:50,789
I tried.

544
00:27:55,011 --> 00:27:56,257
And look at him now.

545
00:27:59,089 --> 00:28:00,177
Look at my boy.

546
00:28:01,659 --> 00:28:03,475
He was a brilliant young man.

547
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:06,142
From nothing,

548
00:28:06,611 --> 00:28:09,020
under his own steam,
he got himself a scholarship

549
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:10,871
to Cambridge to study Classics.

550
00:28:12,022 --> 00:28:14,942
That's what got him invited
to preview the museum's new collection.

551
00:28:16,581 --> 00:28:17,989
And he stole the ring.

552
00:28:19,438 --> 00:28:21,108
That was an impulsive act.

553
00:28:21,576 --> 00:28:22,802
He's not a thief.

554
00:28:23,489 --> 00:28:25,077
He's a foolish, rebellious kid.

555
00:28:26,095 --> 00:28:30,082
He took a copy of the ring in with him.
It wasn't an impulsive act. But a plan.

556
00:28:30,731 --> 00:28:32,418
He's not a thief.

557
00:28:33,473 --> 00:28:34,717
You believe that,

558
00:28:35,397 --> 00:28:36,663
and that was your plan.

559
00:28:36,788 --> 00:28:39,861
If you could just talk to him,
he'd return the ring, because he's...

560
00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:42,627
As you say, not a thief.

561
00:28:42,752 --> 00:28:43,902
I could have.

562
00:28:45,335 --> 00:28:48,517
If I made it in time,
I could have done that.

563
00:28:50,275 --> 00:28:52,015
And now you track down his killer

564
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,439
and kill them.

565
00:28:54,035 --> 00:28:55,735
You know how that works.

566
00:28:56,788 --> 00:28:58,444
I read all about you, Mr. Jane.

567
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:01,775
I know what happened to your family.

568
00:29:07,536 --> 00:29:09,080
You'll end up in prison.

569
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:10,790
Maybe.

570
00:29:12,104 --> 00:29:14,432
But right now
I'm gonna walk out of here.

571
00:29:14,729 --> 00:29:15,878
You're gonna let me.

572
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:19,673
Obviously. You're holding a gun,
and I have no real reason to stop you.

573
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,460
Thanks for being sensible.

574
00:29:23,104 --> 00:29:24,604
It's my middle name.

575
00:29:35,467 --> 00:29:37,421
I'm having a private word
with everyone here

576
00:29:37,546 --> 00:29:39,508
to kinda set the tone.

577
00:29:40,486 --> 00:29:42,914
Cool. It's, an excellent practice.

578
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,490
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

579
00:29:46,544 --> 00:29:48,362
I spoke to Lisbon yesterday...

580
00:29:49,479 --> 00:29:52,644
Told her how deeply I value
your contribution to the bureau.

581
00:29:55,191 --> 00:29:56,210
Nice to hear.

582
00:29:57,115 --> 00:29:59,564
I told her you're too good to lose
to some smart-ass move

583
00:29:59,689 --> 00:30:01,509
you might make that turns bad.

584
00:30:02,401 --> 00:30:05,094
I told her that if and when it happens,
it's her neck.

585
00:30:07,193 --> 00:30:08,193
You...

586
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,476
You're golden.

587
00:30:11,808 --> 00:30:13,874
You're safe for anything
short of murder.

588
00:30:17,813 --> 00:30:19,233
You mess up, she's out of here.

589
00:30:20,532 --> 00:30:21,560
Any questions?

590
00:30:22,545 --> 00:30:24,613
Not that I can think of right now.

591
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:26,757
Good.

592
00:30:27,829 --> 00:30:30,989
Thank you for your time.
I look forward to working with you.

593
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:34,290
Likewise.

594
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:36,990
Thank you.

595
00:30:38,216 --> 00:30:39,372
See you around.

596
00:30:44,045 --> 00:30:45,802
<i>I knew the purchase was illegal.</i>

597
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:47,928
<i>I didn't want trouble.</i>

598
00:30:48,443 --> 00:30:49,443
Ironic.

599
00:30:50,966 --> 00:30:53,184
- Where's the gun now?
- I have no idea.

600
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:56,812
<i>I haven't seen it since the shoot,
which is what, like six weeks ago?</i>

601
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,119
I thought it might be somewhere
in my studio,

602
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:00,858
but you would have found it.

603
00:31:01,336 --> 00:31:02,735
Maybe somebody stole it.

604
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:04,069
That's not credible.

605
00:31:04,478 --> 00:31:05,645
It's the truth.

606
00:31:07,995 --> 00:31:10,659
I was going through the files
on Banks's laptop, and I found this

607
00:31:11,145 --> 00:31:13,345
and this in his telephone records.

608
00:31:20,161 --> 00:31:21,161
You mind?

609
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:22,490
All yours.

610
00:31:24,563 --> 00:31:25,927
Do you know anything

611
00:31:26,052 --> 00:31:28,719
about the theft of a ring
at the British Museum?

612
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,763
Cleopatra's wedding ring,
supposedly.

613
00:31:32,789 --> 00:31:33,789
Why?

614
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:37,124
We checked your browser history
on your office computer.

615
00:31:37,639 --> 00:31:40,078
You looked up the theft of the ring
two months ago,

616
00:31:40,933 --> 00:31:43,275
right after you let Stans
move into your pool house.

617
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,335
Downloaded quite a bit about it.

618
00:31:48,929 --> 00:31:50,063
I never did this.

619
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:53,442
You also made several phone calls
to a man named Louis Anglet,

620
00:31:53,846 --> 00:31:55,412
who we believe may have purchased

621
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,956
- the ring.
- Anglet?

622
00:31:57,649 --> 00:31:58,958
I've never heard of him.

623
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:02,538
The calls are in your phone records.

624
00:32:05,122 --> 00:32:07,257
I paid for overnight delivery.

625
00:32:07,382 --> 00:32:10,296
I was told guaranteed delivery
before 10:00 AM.

626
00:32:10,606 --> 00:32:11,929
And it's not here yet.

627
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:14,591
If it gets here by then
that'll be fine. Thank you.

628
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:18,106
- No word on Slocombe?
- Never despair. Van Pelt brings hope.

629
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:21,420
We've been tracking
this Anglet guy via cell phone.

630
00:32:21,609 --> 00:32:23,643
Off that,
we got a bead on his credit card.

631
00:32:23,768 --> 00:32:26,395
Someone else is tracking
his purchases as well.

632
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,445
- Has to be Slocombe.
- At 3:00 this afternoon,

633
00:32:28,915 --> 00:32:30,072
Anglet has a massage

634
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,908
booked at the Blue Willow Spa,
right here in downtown Sacramento.

635
00:32:34,145 --> 00:32:35,911
- Chances are...
- He'll show up.

636
00:32:39,471 --> 00:32:40,471
So good.

637
00:32:48,498 --> 00:32:49,597
I got Anglet.

638
00:32:54,177 --> 00:32:55,306
Bottle of water.

639
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:02,104
I see Slocombe.

640
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:07,443
Got a question for you.

641
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:09,320
I think you have the wrong guy...

642
00:33:10,258 --> 00:33:12,114
- Did you kill my boy?
- No.

643
00:33:12,369 --> 00:33:14,241
- Did you kill my boy?
- Get off me!

644
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,912
CBI! On the ground!
Slocombe, drop the weapon!

645
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,028
Drop it!

646
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,096
I just meant to question him.

647
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:36,035
I don't know what came over me.
I saw red.

648
00:33:37,966 --> 00:33:41,060
I'll end up in prison,
just like you predicted. Very foolish.

649
00:33:43,546 --> 00:33:44,688
It's human nature.

650
00:33:45,345 --> 00:33:47,403
It made me realize
revenge is not for me.

651
00:33:48,038 --> 00:33:49,038
Pointless.

652
00:33:49,262 --> 00:33:52,112
More violence is just more violence.
Doesn't make anything any better.

653
00:33:52,588 --> 00:33:53,588
Maybe.

654
00:33:54,325 --> 00:33:55,421
I'm not so...

655
00:33:57,487 --> 00:33:59,328
You're booked on the 8:00
to London tomorrow.

656
00:33:59,577 --> 00:34:01,288
Take it,
there'll be no charges pending.

657
00:34:01,995 --> 00:34:04,200
- Thank you.
- I don't want to see you again.

658
00:34:04,325 --> 00:34:05,042
Clear?

659
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:06,790
Yes, ma'am.

660
00:34:07,254 --> 00:34:08,254
Thank you.

661
00:34:14,238 --> 00:34:15,307
That's mine.

662
00:34:26,248 --> 00:34:28,973
Francis Slocombe,
the man who was trying to kill you...

663
00:34:29,098 --> 00:34:30,109
Why was that?

664
00:34:31,097 --> 00:34:32,528
I have no idea.

665
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,947
<i>We know that Slocombe
was tracking you.</i>

666
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:37,241
<i>We know that you came here
for the ring.</i>

667
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,633
<i>This ring must be very important.</i>

668
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:41,886
Anglet's lawyer's here.

669
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:44,581
What kind of ring?

670
00:34:47,616 --> 00:34:48,669
Excuse me.

671
00:34:54,885 --> 00:34:56,176
He's tough.

672
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,313
There's a reason
why he hasn't been in jail.

673
00:34:58,438 --> 00:34:59,638
That's his attorney.

674
00:34:59,953 --> 00:35:02,078
Probably gets about $1,500 an hour.

675
00:35:02,203 --> 00:35:04,810
Let's spend a little time with him,
run up the meter.

676
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:11,301
Excuse me. I'm Agent Lisbon.

677
00:35:11,426 --> 00:35:13,110
Would you come to my office, please?

678
00:35:30,649 --> 00:35:33,537
- You don't look like my lawyer.
- I'll take that as a compliment.

679
00:35:34,145 --> 00:35:36,626
- I'm not gonna answer any questions.
- No more questions.

680
00:35:36,751 --> 00:35:38,706
I know you didn't kill Stans.
You're too smart.

681
00:35:38,831 --> 00:35:41,555
But what you did do
is you bought the Cleopatra ring.

682
00:35:44,237 --> 00:35:45,267
The Cleopatra?

683
00:35:49,885 --> 00:35:51,368
<i>... here's what you got.</i>

684
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:52,920
<i>One of these...</i>

685
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,965
<i>39 dollars, fakies.</i>

686
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,669
<i>Considerably more if you have to get
the overnight delivery.</i>

687
00:35:59,794 --> 00:36:00,866
<i>Not your fault.</i>

688
00:36:01,364 --> 00:36:03,619
No reason to think
it was a fake, obviously.

689
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:05,866
Stans did steal the ring.

690
00:36:06,107 --> 00:36:07,842
That's why it's such a great scam.

691
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:10,167
He can sell the same ring over

692
00:36:10,432 --> 00:36:11,498
and over.

693
00:36:12,166 --> 00:36:14,287
Now the person you bought
the ring for...

694
00:36:15,417 --> 00:36:17,343
I'm guessing they paid more

695
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:19,101
than 39 dollars for it.

696
00:36:19,514 --> 00:36:21,147
How much did they pay for it?

697
00:36:23,362 --> 00:36:24,662
200,000 dollars?

698
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:27,810
More?

699
00:36:29,709 --> 00:36:31,509
More than 200,000 dollars?

700
00:36:34,232 --> 00:36:37,397
I think they're gonna be pretty mad
when they find out it's a fake.

701
00:36:39,482 --> 00:36:40,572
What do you think?

702
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:45,327
You can go now.
Your attorney's waiting.

703
00:36:49,767 --> 00:36:50,767
See you.

704
00:36:54,794 --> 00:36:55,671
You stay.

705
00:36:56,025 --> 00:36:57,025
I'm staying.

706
00:36:58,383 --> 00:36:59,549
The evidence suggests

707
00:36:59,674 --> 00:37:01,844
that Hopper killed Stans
and sold the ring to Anglet.

708
00:37:02,814 --> 00:37:04,137
It does suggest that.

709
00:37:04,438 --> 00:37:06,852
So you just put Hopper
in a great deal of danger.

710
00:37:11,856 --> 00:37:13,397
That's your considered reply?

711
00:37:17,218 --> 00:37:19,574
- Put a guard on Hopper asap.
- Will do.

712
00:37:19,699 --> 00:37:22,406
This is exactly the kind
of scenario we talked about.

713
00:37:24,856 --> 00:37:26,618
Didn't think we'd get there so soon.

714
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:30,164
You butt is on the line,
Agent Lisbon.

715
00:37:36,414 --> 00:37:37,462
What did you do?

716
00:37:37,773 --> 00:37:39,965
Paid way too much
for overnight delivery.

717
00:37:41,043 --> 00:37:43,586
- Maybe we should consider...
- Protective custody?

718
00:37:43,773 --> 00:37:44,511
No way.

719
00:37:45,018 --> 00:37:46,263
I'll put a team togetherr.

720
00:37:46,879 --> 00:37:49,308
Full protection 24/7,
my 4 best guys.

721
00:37:49,633 --> 00:37:51,518
- You don't understand...
- Sure.

722
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:54,009
You people convinced Anglet
that I cheated him,

723
00:37:54,134 --> 00:37:56,899
and then turned him loose to kill me.
That pretty much how it goes?

724
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:59,443
That's pretty much how it goes.
But for the record,

725
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:02,162
Agent Lisbon
had absolutely nothing to do with this.

726
00:38:02,287 --> 00:38:03,906
- How gallant.
- It was my idea.

727
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:07,534
We could have held Anglet
if you had admit selling him the ring.

728
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:08,785
Get out.

729
00:38:10,267 --> 00:38:11,872
Pray nothing happens to my family.

730
00:38:27,718 --> 00:38:28,555
Come on.

731
00:38:42,795 --> 00:38:45,238
Where is it?
I want the real ring.

732
00:38:46,456 --> 00:38:47,491
What?

733
00:38:47,786 --> 00:38:49,018
I gave it to you.

734
00:38:49,557 --> 00:38:51,119
You sold me the fake.

735
00:38:51,444 --> 00:38:53,612
I want the real one now.

736
00:38:54,186 --> 00:38:56,729
I gave you the real one, all right?
Trust me.

737
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,118
I put a gun in that guy's face.

738
00:38:59,393 --> 00:39:01,004
There's no way
he'd hand over a fake.

739
00:39:01,378 --> 00:39:03,048
- Put the gun down!
- Drop the gun!

740
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:04,257
All right.

741
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,474
What did I do?
I just helped you catch him.

742
00:39:06,912 --> 00:39:08,887
- All right, relax.
- On the ground!

743
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,722
Put your hands on your head.

744
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,440
Up against the truck.

745
00:39:14,675 --> 00:39:16,014
Let's see your hands.

746
00:39:18,701 --> 00:39:21,858
You're under arrest
for the murder of Oliver Stans.

747
00:39:25,155 --> 00:39:28,611
- You think being a cop's stressful?
- Try being a cop in prison.

748
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:30,010
Jerk.

749
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:35,989
I know my job.

750
00:39:36,488 --> 00:39:38,164
I do good background checks.

751
00:39:38,914 --> 00:39:41,105
I found out
that Smithson was really Stans,

752
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:44,235
found out about the ring.
I approached him. We talked.

753
00:39:45,206 --> 00:39:47,134
He couldn't sell the ring.
It was too hot.

754
00:39:48,361 --> 00:39:51,373
But I know some people
that put me in touch with Anglet,

755
00:39:51,498 --> 00:39:53,857
and that was it.
I brokered the deal.

756
00:39:55,437 --> 00:39:56,890
Why'd you kill Stans?

757
00:39:59,365 --> 00:40:00,640
He changed his mind.

758
00:40:01,439 --> 00:40:02,691
Didn't want to sell it.

759
00:40:03,172 --> 00:40:04,426
At the last minute,

760
00:40:04,747 --> 00:40:06,361
the idiot wanted to confess,

761
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,216
return it to the museum.

762
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:10,490
What was I supposed to do?

763
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:11,743
You shot him.

764
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:16,819
I had no choice.

765
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:19,458
It was a spur of the moment.

766
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:20,626
Right.

767
00:40:21,007 --> 00:40:23,628
No premeditation, no death penalty.
The only thing?

768
00:40:24,324 --> 00:40:25,464
You planned ahead.

769
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:28,086
You planted the phone
and Internet evidence on Hopper Banks.

770
00:40:28,211 --> 00:40:29,301
That's not good.

771
00:41:03,467 --> 00:41:04,917
It appears I was...

772
00:41:05,489 --> 00:41:07,354
wrong about your son.
He wasn't a thief.

773
00:41:07,479 --> 00:41:09,484
He wanted to return the ring.

774
00:41:11,364 --> 00:41:12,782
Anglet cut a deal,

775
00:41:13,368 --> 00:41:14,763
traded for his freedom.

776
00:41:15,956 --> 00:41:17,099
Way of the world.

777
00:41:18,313 --> 00:41:19,719
It doesn't feel any better.

778
00:41:19,955 --> 00:41:22,344
Knowing who killed him,
knowing he'll be punished.

779
00:41:22,696 --> 00:41:24,189
It doesn't make a difference.

780
00:41:25,133 --> 00:41:26,340
I thought it would.

781
00:41:27,254 --> 00:41:28,193
But this...

782
00:41:29,106 --> 00:41:30,348
is what he wanted.

783
00:41:31,414 --> 00:41:33,323
I can give that to him now,
thanks to you.

784
00:41:38,492 --> 00:41:39,913
I better not miss my plane.

785
00:41:40,441 --> 00:41:42,741
- Time to say good bye.
- Good bye.

786
00:41:44,589 --> 00:41:45,752
I wasn't gonna hug you.

787
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,920
I know.

788
00:41:47,162 --> 00:41:48,512
Just making sure.

789
00:42:07,055 --> 00:42:08,119
Comfortable?

790
00:42:09,182 --> 00:42:10,569
I'm getting there, yeah.

791
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:14,656
Regarding Agents Rigsby

792
00:42:14,843 --> 00:42:16,093
and Van Pelt...

793
00:42:16,838 --> 00:42:18,892
they're in a romantic relationship.

794
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,217
You're too good of a cop
not to have noticed,

795
00:42:24,342 --> 00:42:27,210
As you do anything about it,
I'm gonna to take action myself.

796
00:42:28,661 --> 00:42:30,583
Just wanted to let you know first.

797
00:42:32,918 --> 00:42:33,968
Good night.

798
00:42:35,271 --> 00:42:36,420
Good night.

799
00:42:47,096 --> 00:42:48,146
She's good.
