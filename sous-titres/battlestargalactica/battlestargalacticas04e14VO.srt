<i>Previously on</i>
Battlestar Galactica...

2
00:00:04,013 --> 00:00:07,757
The world is frakked. It's upside down,
somebody's gotta turn it right side up.

3
00:00:08,023 --> 00:00:09,175
Are you that man?

4
00:00:09,733 --> 00:00:10,718
I'm one of them.

5
00:00:14,311 --> 00:00:15,247
Combat, Gaeta.

6
00:00:15,372 --> 00:00:17,280
We've got civilians
arming themselves down here.

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,183
Gaeta!

8
00:00:21,308 --> 00:00:23,981
Sergeant of the guards, get your marines
in here. Nobody gets in or out.

9
00:00:24,184 --> 00:00:25,608
What the hell are you doing?

10
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:28,841
Admiral Adama. I am removing you
from command of this ship.

11
00:00:29,476 --> 00:00:30,655
Admiral, don't do this.

12
00:00:30,824 --> 00:00:33,908
I'm damned if I'm going to let
a guy like you run me off my own ship.

13
00:00:38,665 --> 00:00:40,012
We are going to make sure

14
00:00:40,137 --> 00:00:42,249
that the President's Raptor
gets out of here safely.

15
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,919
- No, dad, you can't stay here...
- I'm depending on you.

16
00:00:45,326 --> 00:00:47,672
Make sure these animals
don't dishonor this ship.

17
00:00:55,812 --> 00:00:57,138
I'll see you soon.

18
00:01:19,077 --> 00:01:20,955
Raptor just took off
from an aft airlock.

19
00:01:22,014 --> 00:01:24,314
Arm all weapons.
Engage the target.

20
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:25,719
And destroy.

21
00:01:30,562 --> 00:01:32,711
<i>Narcho, Galactica,
hostile Raptor outbound.</i>

22
00:01:32,836 --> 00:01:35,061
<i>Bearing 6-3-4 at 2.</i>

23
00:01:35,186 --> 00:01:37,387
Order your flight to engage the target
and destroy.

24
00:01:37,512 --> 00:01:39,032
<i>Roger, Galactica.</i>

25
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,900
Well, well, well...

26
00:01:59,435 --> 00:02:00,835
it's the brig rat.

27
00:02:03,381 --> 00:02:04,373
Admiral.

28
00:02:09,871 --> 00:02:12,374
<i>Galactica, Narcho,
blind out of the sixth gate.</i>

29
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,581
<i>Breaking, go in zone five to pursue.</i>

30
00:02:14,706 --> 00:02:18,512
Red Viper Two, Narcho,
the target's in your front yard. Engage.

31
00:02:18,935 --> 00:02:20,759
Narcho, Hot Dog, tally, I got her.

32
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:24,268
<i>Colonial Raptor, Red Viper Two.
Identify yourself immediately.</i>

33
00:02:24,622 --> 00:02:27,354
- <i>Repeat, identify.</i>
- Dig the crap out of your ears.

34
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:28,811
<i>Engage and destroy!</i>

35
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:30,745
Narcho, Hot Dog, target in range.

36
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,808
- Waiting for Raptor I.D.
- <i>Damn it, Hot Dog...</i>

37
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:34,820
<i>Galactica, Narcho, coming around.</i>

38
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,588
Bearing 9-3-4. Still no joy.

39
00:02:38,028 --> 00:02:39,074
Hot Dog, Narcho,

40
00:02:39,402 --> 00:02:41,183
<i>destroy the target or disengage.</i>

41
00:02:41,308 --> 00:02:44,058
<i>I repeat,
destroy the target or disengage.</i>

42
00:02:44,183 --> 00:02:45,683
Where's the...

43
00:02:47,152 --> 00:02:48,542
This is President Laura Roslin

44
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,836
<i>aboard the Raptor, do not fire.</i>

45
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,254
Jam her transmission.

46
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,913
<i>... escape from the mutineers
that have taken over Galactica...</i>

47
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,802
Grabbed it, sir.

48
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,100
They're still on us.
Sit down, and hang on.

49
00:03:02,832 --> 00:03:05,601
- Hot Dog, Narcho, target status report.
- <i>I don't know.</i>

50
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:08,820
That was the President,
she's on board the target.

51
00:03:10,193 --> 00:03:13,379
We've got Adama and Tigh.
They were in the auxiliary airlock.

52
00:03:13,504 --> 00:03:16,454
Put Tigh and Adama down
with the Cylon prisoners.

53
00:03:17,502 --> 00:03:21,074
Belay that. Put Tigh with the Cylons.
Bring Adama up here now.

54
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:22,535
Understood.

55
00:03:25,636 --> 00:03:27,749
Kareem, patch me through to Red Two.

56
00:03:29,881 --> 00:03:32,070
Lieutenant Costanza,
Galactica actual,

57
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:34,505
<i>you were given an order,
now follow it.</i>

58
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:38,509
Stop frakking thinking
and shoot, Gods damn it.

59
00:03:39,067 --> 00:03:40,219
Galactica, Narcho,

60
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:43,889
<i>tally, I have the target.
Maneuvering in position.</i>

61
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:45,933
- Frak, Narcho!
- <i>I'm in, I'm in.</i>

62
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,711
They've got a missile lock on us.

63
00:04:00,793 --> 00:04:03,450
Missiles missed the target.
The Raptor boarded the baseship.

64
00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:14,692
- Why are we under attack?
- Vipers are firing on our ship.

65
00:04:14,817 --> 00:04:16,877
You're not under attack,
they're firing at us.

66
00:04:17,002 --> 00:04:19,631
- What did you do?
- Their government has lost control.

67
00:04:19,756 --> 00:04:21,632
Our government has not lost control.

68
00:04:21,757 --> 00:04:23,512
Excuse me,
how would you describe it?

69
00:04:23,872 --> 00:04:25,097
Adama is a fugitive.

70
00:04:25,503 --> 00:04:28,517
Gaeta has an army,
and Zarek has control of Colonial One.

71
00:04:29,191 --> 00:04:31,562
- Adama is free. Don't listen...
- The last time we saw Adama,

72
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,981
he was cornered in an airlock
with Tigh.

73
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:37,109
If you were forced to escape, Gaeta and
Zarek must've had substantial support.

74
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:41,530
They don't! We're here because a pilot
refused to shoot us down, tell him.

75
00:04:41,756 --> 00:04:44,347
Yes, but the other pilot
had no qualms

76
00:04:44,472 --> 00:04:47,319
about shooting down the President.
If they're willing to do that...

77
00:04:47,444 --> 00:04:50,085
- It's not safe. We have to jump.
- I have to agree.

78
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,958
But what about the Four? Tyrol,
Anders, Tigh, they're still over there.

79
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,125
What about them?

80
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,211
If you jump,
you'll never see them again.

81
00:04:56,715 --> 00:04:59,840
If you stay put, you give Adama
a chance to save them.

82
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:03,344
Put your ship
in the middle of the fleet.

83
00:05:03,513 --> 00:05:05,930
Use the fleet for cover.
Give Adama some time.

84
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:08,140
- But what if...
- Gaeta won't jeopardize the fleet.

85
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,809
He doesn't have the guts.
Come on, do it!

86
00:05:17,764 --> 00:05:18,984
Welcome back.

87
00:05:19,824 --> 00:05:21,946
I had a feeling you wouldn't be
on that Raptor.

88
00:05:23,777 --> 00:05:25,727
I care too much for this ship

89
00:05:26,564 --> 00:05:28,953
to let it be overrun by rats.

90
00:05:29,502 --> 00:05:30,502
Right.

91
00:05:31,557 --> 00:05:33,624
If only you cared as much
about the people on it.

92
00:05:36,067 --> 00:05:38,003
You have no frakkin' idea.

93
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:40,506
Well, then show me.
You want to save some lives?

94
00:05:41,067 --> 00:05:45,071
Get on the radio and call Roslin.
Tell her to come back and surrender.

95
00:05:45,196 --> 00:05:46,196
No.

96
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:49,890
I'll ask you one more time, Admiral.

97
00:05:50,143 --> 00:05:51,955
Admiral.

98
00:05:52,696 --> 00:05:53,852
Admiral.

99
00:05:56,868 --> 00:05:58,482
You're the Admiral now.

100
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:02,592
So you call up Roslin.

101
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:05,531
Make her laugh.

102
00:06:13,369 --> 00:06:16,301
All hands to battle stations.
Set condition one.

103
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,275
Gun battery, stand by.
Target bearing...

104
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,588
Sir. The baseship.

105
00:06:27,978 --> 00:06:29,388
They're moving into the fleet.

106
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:33,017
They're hiding in the fleet.

107
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:37,529
Battle stations, stand down.

108
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:42,688
Marine, launch blue squadron,
have them quarantine the baseship.

109
00:06:43,076 --> 00:06:46,822
Gage, spin up our FTL.
Alert the ship captains to do the same.

110
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:50,200
Kelly,
prepare for Mr. Zarek's arrival.

111
00:06:55,216 --> 00:06:57,716
Now you're going to shoot me,
Mr. Gaeta.

00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:55,718
Shall we save the kids?

115
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:58,018
And the attorney says, "Frakk'em."

116
00:07:58,187 --> 00:08:00,833
And the priest says,
"Do we have time?"

117
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:12,490
Damn it.

118
00:08:17,235 --> 00:08:19,285
This is President Laura Roslin.

119
00:08:20,538 --> 00:08:22,626
This is the President speaking...

120
00:08:24,726 --> 00:08:25,627
Hello!

121
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,924
Gods damn it.

122
00:08:45,372 --> 00:08:47,359
It's okay,
he's going to feel better.

123
00:08:49,023 --> 00:08:50,973
Wonder what Gaeta's gonna do.

124
00:08:52,082 --> 00:08:53,407
In your case,

125
00:08:53,717 --> 00:08:55,874
cut off one of your frakkin' legs.

126
00:08:58,931 --> 00:09:00,455
I have a net over the baseship,

127
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:03,724
you didn't have to bring
the whole Quorum with you.

128
00:09:03,854 --> 00:09:06,787
- If you're insisting on the trial.
- I'm insisting.

129
00:09:07,818 --> 00:09:10,288
Then I want them
where I can keep an eye on them.

130
00:09:11,729 --> 00:09:14,148
Look, I know
you want to do the right thing.

131
00:09:14,358 --> 00:09:16,751
I'm sorry, I was under the impression
that you did too.

132
00:09:16,944 --> 00:09:19,050
I do. But we need to move on.

133
00:09:19,175 --> 00:09:21,894
We can't move on. Until people
have answered for what they've done.

134
00:09:22,181 --> 00:09:23,984
Which begins with Adama.

135
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,018
One world at a time, Tom.

136
00:09:48,382 --> 00:09:50,615
I don't suppose
anyone's gonna feed my dog.

137
00:09:58,902 --> 00:10:01,875
The Admiral is charged with treason,

138
00:10:02,804 --> 00:10:04,186
desertion,

139
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:08,787
giving aid and comfort to the enemy,
and gross dereliction of duty.

140
00:10:08,912 --> 00:10:11,360
The punishment for these crimes
is death by firing squad.

141
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,573
Well, I'm not a very good shot.

142
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,411
The Admiral is entitled
to a court-martial.

143
00:10:22,058 --> 00:10:25,075
We need a lawyer
to handle his defense.

144
00:10:28,488 --> 00:10:29,795
They need a pimp.

145
00:10:33,324 --> 00:10:35,843
Commander Gaeta
will represent the people.

146
00:10:37,857 --> 00:10:39,399
Commander Gaeta...

147
00:10:40,266 --> 00:10:41,890
Why are you doing this?

148
00:10:43,369 --> 00:10:44,658
For justice.

149
00:10:46,025 --> 00:10:47,137
Justice...

150
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:50,023
So it'd be fair to assume

151
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,455
that should I choose to

152
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:56,819
pass on this field trip for justice,

153
00:10:57,755 --> 00:11:01,154
Winkin' and Blinkin' over there
will use me instead for target practice?

154
00:11:01,803 --> 00:11:03,573
Just get on with your job.

155
00:11:07,432 --> 00:11:08,497
Fine.

156
00:11:09,601 --> 00:11:11,101
Bring in the judges.

157
00:11:12,626 --> 00:11:14,522
I will be serving as judge.

158
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:18,062
I see, so we've run out
of ship's captains, then.

159
00:11:18,738 --> 00:11:20,864
Captains are too busy
protecting their vessels

160
00:11:20,989 --> 00:11:24,182
from the Cylon baseship
Admiral Adama welcomed into their fleet.

161
00:11:25,228 --> 00:11:26,727
Shove it up your ass.

162
00:11:27,739 --> 00:11:29,753
I don't need a frakking lawyer.

163
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:32,210
- You are charged with treason...
- By who?

164
00:11:32,335 --> 00:11:34,595
- Desertion, giving comfort and aid...
- This is a joke.

165
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,612
- And you will answer for these crimes.
- Aid and comfort, yeah.

166
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,615
I did bathe and wash them.
Made their meals.

167
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:43,585
- I love the enemy.
- Could I have

168
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,704
a few minutes with Mr. Adama?

169
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:49,123
Just to impress upon him
the gravity of these charges?

170
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:50,458
Please?

171
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,419
You want him to understand,
I know you do.

172
00:12:10,233 --> 00:12:11,355
Make it quick.

173
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,232
This is the President.
This is Laura Ros... Hello?

174
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,924
Hello? Hello?

175
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,784
We don't even have
the protection of the fleet.

176
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:21,407
They've scattered.

177
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,875
And the Viper patrols,
they've gotten bolder.

178
00:12:24,136 --> 00:12:25,786
Some of them check their guns.

179
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,290
Firing into space is like
they're inviting us to react.

180
00:12:30,532 --> 00:12:32,292
I think we should all talk.

181
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:51,103
"The world's upside down.

182
00:12:51,447 --> 00:12:54,246
"And someone
has to turn it right side up again."

183
00:12:54,922 --> 00:12:56,483
Felix Gaeta said that to me.

184
00:12:57,516 --> 00:12:59,516
He believes he's that someone.

185
00:13:00,423 --> 00:13:02,323
I believe he's that someone.

186
00:13:03,484 --> 00:13:05,742
But he has very big shoes to fill.

187
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:10,539
I brought you here because
I wanted him to meet people who refuse

188
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:13,976
to give up, people who have
the courage to voice their dissent.

189
00:13:14,806 --> 00:13:17,838
But at the end of the day,
still stand by your president.

190
00:13:33,151 --> 00:13:35,101
I think you should leave now.

191
00:13:36,164 --> 00:13:37,649
Mr. Vice President.

192
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,698
- So say we all.
- Hear, hear.

193
00:14:10,214 --> 00:14:11,224
Shoot them.

194
00:14:16,382 --> 00:14:17,843
Go get Mr. Gaeta.

195
00:14:46,082 --> 00:14:48,048
- I never agreed to this!
- Yes, you did.

196
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:50,280
- No, this is murder!
- This is a coup.

197
00:14:51,163 --> 00:14:52,433
That you began.

198
00:14:54,116 --> 00:14:57,605
To take command and destroy our enemies,
before they destroy us.

199
00:14:59,619 --> 00:15:01,025
What've you done?

200
00:15:01,397 --> 00:15:02,433
This...

201
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:04,034
is what happens.

202
00:15:07,262 --> 00:15:08,686
No, it's a lie.

203
00:15:09,697 --> 00:15:11,728
This is all based on lies.

204
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:15,646
Don't you get it?

205
00:15:17,382 --> 00:15:19,293
We had the truth on our side, now...

206
00:15:20,576 --> 00:15:21,621
Now...

207
00:15:24,672 --> 00:15:27,680
The truth is told
by whoever is left standing.

208
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,296
Adama has to go.

209
00:15:32,787 --> 00:15:34,793
There's no turning back now.

210
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:00,918
Sorry.

211
00:16:01,485 --> 00:16:03,255
It was a difficult choice

212
00:16:04,569 --> 00:16:06,173
but we made our decision.

213
00:16:09,137 --> 00:16:10,636
We're jumping away.

214
00:16:15,238 --> 00:16:18,310
We have a chance to survive.

215
00:16:19,418 --> 00:16:21,863
I'm sorry, I would've thought
as one of the Final Five,

216
00:16:21,988 --> 00:16:24,984
you'd have a broader vision
than that.

217
00:16:25,767 --> 00:16:27,236
If he hasn't done it already,

218
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,867
Gaeta will air lock Tigh,
Tyrol, Anders,

219
00:16:30,384 --> 00:16:32,114
then he'll start with the rest.

220
00:16:32,497 --> 00:16:35,424
- Kara, Helo, Adama...
- Don't. Stop.

221
00:16:35,549 --> 00:16:38,372
His fate has been all but decided,
count on it.

222
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:40,455
- Please, don't.
- Ours isn't yet.

223
00:16:42,553 --> 00:16:44,301
No one believed
that we would survive

224
00:16:44,426 --> 00:16:48,373
the Cylon nuclear holocaust,
or the hell on New Caprica,

225
00:16:48,498 --> 00:16:51,786
or the 50,000 other crises
we've lived through.

226
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:55,169
But we did, we're here.
We've made this veritable habit

227
00:16:55,294 --> 00:16:58,004
out of defying the odds,
particularly William Adama.

228
00:16:58,129 --> 00:17:00,489
And he is alive.

229
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:05,326
He is alive. And he will take
command of this fleet again.

230
00:17:05,451 --> 00:17:08,258
And when that day comes,
he's gonna know...

231
00:17:09,185 --> 00:17:10,904
who stuck with him and who ran.

232
00:17:11,966 --> 00:17:13,866
Now who do you want to be?

233
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,758
Who do you want to be?

234
00:17:20,596 --> 00:17:21,826
Hey, Chief.

235
00:17:24,253 --> 00:17:26,461
Looking for a gun?

236
00:17:26,586 --> 00:17:27,546
Hey, Aaron.

237
00:17:29,274 --> 00:17:30,648
Sprung you, did they?

238
00:17:32,999 --> 00:17:34,970
- Long live the revolution.
- Out.

239
00:17:36,884 --> 00:17:40,100
Just shoot me now.
I'm too frakking tired to get out.

240
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,852
You're a frakking machine, get out.

241
00:17:43,409 --> 00:17:45,230
That's right, I'm a machine.

242
00:17:45,867 --> 00:17:47,111
What does that make you?

243
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,109
Dumbass?

244
00:18:13,407 --> 00:18:15,598
This was a hell of a ship once.

245
00:18:18,286 --> 00:18:19,682
It really was.

246
00:18:23,873 --> 00:18:25,862
Heard your kid's not a Cylon.

247
00:18:27,505 --> 00:18:29,738
Could have told you she was trouble.

248
00:18:32,907 --> 00:18:33,909
Thanks.

249
00:18:35,983 --> 00:18:37,567
Wouldn't have mattered.

250
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,338
Go on, keep going. Go!

251
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:54,296
Go on, skinjob, go.

252
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,350
Frak!

253
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,980
Forget it.

254
00:19:12,814 --> 00:19:15,270
You think you can
get me to cooperate,

255
00:19:15,395 --> 00:19:18,282
you'll get a pat on the back
instead of a bullet.

256
00:19:19,676 --> 00:19:21,527
Don't let your pride get in the way.

257
00:19:21,652 --> 00:19:23,429
Put your innocence on record
for the fleet.

258
00:19:23,554 --> 00:19:25,412
- Your statement...
- I won't do a statement.

259
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,792
Gaeta and Zarek are gonna fail.

260
00:19:29,685 --> 00:19:31,378
You really believe that?

261
00:19:31,893 --> 00:19:33,334
What do you think?

262
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:37,362
I won't betray my beliefs

263
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,123
with a testimony.

264
00:19:42,545 --> 00:19:44,672
You have people out there mobilizing,
I saw them.

265
00:19:44,797 --> 00:19:47,730
Give them a chance to do something.
Stall or play dumb...

266
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,564
We've been ready to proceed
for some time.

267
00:20:11,353 --> 00:20:12,701
Are you injured?

268
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,224
I believe the word is damaged.

269
00:20:31,304 --> 00:20:33,982
No frakking way.
It's never gonna work.

270
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:36,534
Up close, I can take two of them
before you take your shots.

271
00:20:36,659 --> 00:20:38,613
From back here with a side arm?

272
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,752
We only got one chance
to get this right.

273
00:20:40,877 --> 00:20:42,474
And I'm gonna take it.

274
00:20:45,475 --> 00:20:46,623
Grenade!

275
00:21:07,054 --> 00:21:08,433
Never pulled the pin.

276
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:10,686
Not funny.

277
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,232
It would have been
if you'd thought of it.

278
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:14,364
No.

279
00:21:15,133 --> 00:21:16,121
Not funny.

280
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:25,325
Tigh.

281
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:26,508
It's Kara.

282
00:21:26,633 --> 00:21:27,870
It's Lee and Kara.

283
00:21:28,878 --> 00:21:30,956
- Wait a minute. Where is he?!
- Can you hear me?

284
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,915
Bastards went to town on Helo.

285
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,719
- Where is my father?
- Kelly took him.

286
00:21:34,844 --> 00:21:36,355
What? You were with him.

287
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,297
- What happened?
- I don't frakking know.

288
00:21:38,678 --> 00:21:41,783
Come on, damn it. Let's get out
of here before they find us.

289
00:21:41,908 --> 00:21:43,135
I have Hera.

290
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:44,405
You okay?

291
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:52,588
Go left.

292
00:21:55,979 --> 00:21:58,108
- Kara, frak that, let's go.
- Got it, we'll catch up.

293
00:22:02,471 --> 00:22:03,445
Sam!

294
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:11,872
Oh, Gods!

295
00:22:12,608 --> 00:22:13,903
Oh, my Gods!

296
00:22:19,126 --> 00:22:21,171
Look at me, look at me.
Do you hear me?

297
00:22:22,533 --> 00:22:24,426
Kara! We can't stay here.

298
00:22:25,627 --> 00:22:27,309
Watch his neck, Gods damn it.

299
00:22:27,434 --> 00:22:29,556
We got to go! We got to move Sam.

300
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,598
Take Hera and go to Baltar's people.

301
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:34,102
No one wants to go near those nutjobs.
You'll be safe there.

302
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:36,228
- He's gonna bleed out.
- Don't move his head.

303
00:22:36,415 --> 00:22:38,690
- Go, go!
- I can take care of myself.

304
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,443
You gotta help Sam!

305
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,278
Lee, go, get your father.

306
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,446
Now go.

307
00:22:45,937 --> 00:22:46,698
Go!

308
00:22:48,109 --> 00:22:49,512
Okay, get him to Cottle.

309
00:22:50,154 --> 00:22:52,160
- Athena, go.
- Okay, company, move out!

310
00:22:52,285 --> 00:22:53,788
Okay, let's move. Let's go.

311
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,653
Okay, baby. Okay.

312
00:23:08,158 --> 00:23:10,837
You deserted us on New Caprica.
You let us twist in the wind.

313
00:23:10,962 --> 00:23:12,597
I saved your frakking ass.

314
00:23:12,722 --> 00:23:16,077
Why can't you just admit you've been
derelict in your duties as an officer?

315
00:23:16,202 --> 00:23:19,348
You gave aid and comfort to the enemy,
you were about to grant them access...

316
00:23:19,473 --> 00:23:22,227
- Objection, he's badgering the witness.
- ... to every ship in this fleet.

317
00:23:22,352 --> 00:23:23,735
About to? I did it.

318
00:23:23,908 --> 00:23:25,319
I gave them access.

319
00:23:26,409 --> 00:23:29,282
And you know what?
I didn't give them aid and comfort.

320
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,117
They gave it to me.

321
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:34,303
<i>We just got word that Tigh
and the skinjobs escaped.</i>

322
00:23:34,428 --> 00:23:35,664
<i>Don't worry. We're on it.</i>

323
00:23:48,509 --> 00:23:49,969
Saul Tigh was killed

324
00:23:50,974 --> 00:23:52,258
trying to escape.

325
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:03,791
I'm sorry.

326
00:24:07,408 --> 00:24:09,654
But you did give
aid and comfort to the enemy.

327
00:24:10,201 --> 00:24:11,701
Saul Tigh was a Cylon.

328
00:24:12,846 --> 00:24:16,204
Even when you discovered that he was,
you let him remain the XO, didn't you?

329
00:24:20,534 --> 00:24:23,699
I'm not answering any more questions
for you, Mr. Gaeta.

330
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,548
The prisoner is guilty as charged.

331
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:31,726
This isn't the trial.

332
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:33,471
This is an asylum.

333
00:24:36,868 --> 00:24:38,142
We're done here.

334
00:24:39,758 --> 00:24:43,331
<i>This is President Laura Roslin
speaking from the Cylon baseship.</i>

335
00:24:43,456 --> 00:24:46,938
<i>Felix Gaeta has seized
Galactica by force.</i>

336
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:50,634
<i>The Cylons were defending themselves.
They will not harm you.</i>

337
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:53,241
- <i>I repeat, the Cylons will not harm...</i>
- Jam that signal.

338
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:55,242
Why, by the frak,
is she still broadcasting?

339
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,161
Where's Hoshi?

340
00:24:57,382 --> 00:24:59,205
Get that little frak back into CIC.

341
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:01,292
<i>... shut down your FTL drives...</i>

342
00:25:15,195 --> 00:25:16,195
It worked.

343
00:25:16,865 --> 00:25:18,420
They couldn't jam it.

344
00:25:19,147 --> 00:25:21,162
I thought this might do the trick.

345
00:25:34,742 --> 00:25:36,419
Show me your frakking hands.

346
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:59,884
You have to help me
get him to Cottle.

347
00:26:04,133 --> 00:26:05,354
No, no.

348
00:26:05,631 --> 00:26:06,855
No, just on the way here,

349
00:26:07,294 --> 00:26:09,108
me and my pen pal
were shot at two times.

350
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,784
Once by his own men.

351
00:26:11,192 --> 00:26:12,028
Sorry.

352
00:26:12,694 --> 00:26:14,015
He's gonna die.

353
00:26:14,794 --> 00:26:15,820
I'm sorry.

354
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:28,179
Frak!

355
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:33,159
Ten ships shut down their FTL drives
after Roslin's transmission.

356
00:26:33,694 --> 00:26:35,383
10 ships out of 35.

357
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,929
- Frakking Roslin.
- No, she did us a favor.

358
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:40,232
Now we're clear
who's with us and who's trouble.

359
00:26:40,357 --> 00:26:41,779
Gage, give the jump coordinates

360
00:26:41,904 --> 00:26:44,116
only to those ships
that kept their FTLs online.

361
00:26:44,241 --> 00:26:46,437
- Order them to jump immediately.
- Yes, sir.

362
00:26:50,314 --> 00:26:52,568
I need you to assemble
an execution detail.

363
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,248
Only men you can trust.

364
00:26:57,319 --> 00:26:59,282
Secure the main
hangar deck launch tube.

365
00:26:59,722 --> 00:27:01,619
Take Adama down there
and wait for me.

366
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:05,407
Can I count on you, Noel?

367
00:27:06,408 --> 00:27:07,963
All down the line, sir.

368
00:27:09,814 --> 00:27:11,176
Spying on me, Tom?

369
00:27:12,325 --> 00:27:15,299
Let's just get through this
and move on, all right, Felix?

370
00:28:21,426 --> 00:28:22,733
Where's the old man?

371
00:28:24,479 --> 00:28:27,405
- Where's the old man?
- They're gonna shoot him.

372
00:28:29,865 --> 00:28:30,865
Where?

373
00:28:31,249 --> 00:28:33,947
- Where?!
- Main hangar deck launch tube.

374
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:38,177
Come on, come on,
let's go, Gods damn it.

375
00:28:40,163 --> 00:28:41,719
I'm coming with you.

376
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:50,868
Detail ready.

377
00:28:52,394 --> 00:28:53,107
Aim!

378
00:29:00,003 --> 00:29:01,003
Fire!

379
00:29:03,362 --> 00:29:04,362
No!

380
00:29:05,274 --> 00:29:07,620
You were dreaming.
I couldn't wake you.

381
00:29:08,629 --> 00:29:10,379
Oh, God, they're gonna shoot him.

382
00:29:11,621 --> 00:29:12,928
I feel sick, I...

383
00:29:24,043 --> 00:29:25,043
No.

384
00:29:26,857 --> 00:29:30,005
This is all wrong. It's wrong.
Please, stop, stop.

385
00:29:32,067 --> 00:29:33,067
But...

386
00:29:33,907 --> 00:29:35,398
I wanna make you feel better.

387
00:29:39,905 --> 00:29:41,432
Then cut off my legs.

388
00:29:42,379 --> 00:29:43,379
I ran...

389
00:29:44,854 --> 00:29:45,854
again.

390
00:29:47,255 --> 00:29:49,366
I disappeared in the nick of time...

391
00:29:49,986 --> 00:29:50,986
again.

392
00:29:53,221 --> 00:29:54,916
Fear makes people
behave differently.

393
00:29:55,041 --> 00:29:57,713
I didn't run out of fear.
Not this time, anyway.

394
00:29:58,346 --> 00:30:01,277
I ran away from those people.
God, those people.

395
00:30:02,786 --> 00:30:05,345
I've got a kind of following
on Galactica.

396
00:30:06,489 --> 00:30:07,471
Like a fan club.

397
00:30:08,845 --> 00:30:10,469
Publicly, I heeded them.

398
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:14,002
Privately, I scorned
their provincial intellects.

399
00:30:14,127 --> 00:30:17,452
Their unfailing willingness
to make me feel better.

400
00:30:26,517 --> 00:30:27,893
I have to go back.

401
00:30:30,189 --> 00:30:32,718
I have to go back,
they're my responsibility.

402
00:30:35,262 --> 00:30:36,350
I am sorry.

403
00:31:03,368 --> 00:31:04,468
<i>Galactica...</i>

404
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,871
this is president Laura Roslin.

405
00:31:07,185 --> 00:31:09,775
Release all those
being held against their will,

406
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,869
and return command of this fleet

407
00:31:12,117 --> 00:31:13,920
<i>to admiral William Adama.</i>

408
00:31:14,252 --> 00:31:15,252
<i>Surrender.</i>

409
00:31:16,627 --> 00:31:18,227
<i>You have five minutes.</i>

410
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:59,100
Lieutenant Allison,

411
00:32:00,069 --> 00:32:01,769
carry out the execution.

412
00:32:04,903 --> 00:32:05,903
Yes, sir.

413
00:32:08,828 --> 00:32:10,578
- Dad.
- Thank you, son.

414
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:22,366
- They told me you were dead.
- For a while, I was, Bill.

415
00:32:35,076 --> 00:32:36,976
I want to take back my ship.

416
00:32:43,526 --> 00:32:44,378
Lieutenant.

417
00:32:45,782 --> 00:32:46,832
Sorry, sir.

418
00:32:48,461 --> 00:32:50,261
I've always respected you.

419
00:32:51,175 --> 00:32:52,720
But I hate the Cylons.

420
00:32:53,693 --> 00:32:56,390
And I can't take orders
from a leader who won't fight them.

421
00:32:56,769 --> 00:32:57,609
Colonel.

422
00:32:57,893 --> 00:32:58,892
Stand down.

423
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:12,369
Tie him up.

424
00:33:34,842 --> 00:33:36,075
Put me on speaker.

425
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,016
This is Tom Zarek,

426
00:33:43,141 --> 00:33:44,971
President of the Twelve Colonies.

427
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,316
It's over, Laura.

428
00:33:48,614 --> 00:33:50,527
<i>Saul Tigh was killed
attempting to escape.</i>

429
00:33:53,284 --> 00:33:54,073
<i>Bill Adama</i>

430
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,991
was tried and found guilty
of his crimes.

431
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,530
<i>Firing squad executed him
this morning.</i>

432
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,850
<i>It's done, Laura.</i>

433
00:34:06,011 --> 00:34:07,045
<i>You need to think</i>

434
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,213
about the people of this fleet now

435
00:34:09,474 --> 00:34:10,447
and surrender.

436
00:34:17,157 --> 00:34:18,157
No!

437
00:34:19,934 --> 00:34:21,604
Not now,

438
00:34:22,514 --> 00:34:23,769
not ever.

439
00:34:24,925 --> 00:34:27,106
<i>Do you hear me?
I will use</i>

440
00:34:27,827 --> 00:34:29,675
<i>every cannon,</i>

441
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,689
every bomb, every bullet,

442
00:34:33,073 --> 00:34:36,670
every weapon I have
down to my own eyeteeth

443
00:34:36,795 --> 00:34:37,866
to end you.

444
00:34:38,518 --> 00:34:40,375
I swear it!

445
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:43,491
I'm coming for all of you!

446
00:34:52,621 --> 00:34:55,617
So now we have a military leader
and a president all-in-one.

447
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:59,012
And how would you have answered her?
If you would have been here.

448
00:35:00,115 --> 00:35:01,724
Baseship's arming itself, sir.

449
00:35:03,151 --> 00:35:04,919
- Are we jump ready?
- Affirmative.

450
00:35:05,642 --> 00:35:07,517
Set the rendez-vous jump coordinates.

451
00:35:08,142 --> 00:35:09,598
Set your board to green.

452
00:35:12,455 --> 00:35:13,946
There's been enough killing.

453
00:35:14,071 --> 00:35:16,155
I'm leaving them behind.
Unless you object.

454
00:35:43,649 --> 00:35:44,693
<i>Galactica,</i>

455
00:35:45,212 --> 00:35:47,764
<i>this is President Laura Roslin.</i>

456
00:35:47,889 --> 00:35:48,889
<i>Surrender.</i>

457
00:35:53,107 --> 00:35:54,257
Gods damn it.

458
00:35:57,267 --> 00:35:58,363
Board is green.

459
00:35:58,664 --> 00:35:59,948
Counting it down.

460
00:36:01,835 --> 00:36:02,935
Jump in ten.

461
00:36:04,687 --> 00:36:05,687
<i>Nine.</i>

462
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:08,199
<i>Eight.</i>

463
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,920
Six.

464
00:36:14,927 --> 00:36:15,927
Five.

465
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:19,593
<i>Four.</i>

466
00:36:21,011 --> 00:36:21,847
<i>Three.</i>

467
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:24,767
FTL just went offline.

468
00:36:29,118 --> 00:36:29,978
Get a crew.

469
00:36:30,683 --> 00:36:32,481
Get someone down to the engine room.

470
00:36:33,812 --> 00:36:35,162
Come on, move it!

471
00:36:36,884 --> 00:36:38,540
Gaeta, launch your birds.

472
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:42,574
Wake up. What the frak are you doing?
Launch your birds!

473
00:36:47,292 --> 00:36:49,456
Gaeta, we have to defend,
do you understand that?

474
00:36:50,018 --> 00:36:51,538
Gaeta, we need to defend!

475
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,711
"One day soon,
there's gonna be a reckoning."

476
00:36:55,723 --> 00:36:58,215
Gun batteries have fixed target bearing.
Standing by to fire.

477
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:00,733
Gaeta, what the frak
is wrong with you?

478
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:02,761
Wake up!

479
00:37:04,866 --> 00:37:06,016
Weapons hold!

480
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:14,831
Give me a weapon.

481
00:37:17,846 --> 00:37:19,945
- Put your weapons down.
- Drop your weapons!

482
00:37:34,523 --> 00:37:37,154
- Connect me with the President.
- Right away, Admiral.

483
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:41,800
Madam President.

484
00:37:42,036 --> 00:37:44,344
This is the Admiral. Stand down.

485
00:37:45,393 --> 00:37:46,393
<i>I repeat,</i>

486
00:37:46,717 --> 00:37:48,181
<i>Galactica's secured.</i>

487
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,399
Stand down.

488
00:38:37,906 --> 00:38:38,906
Oh, no.

489
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:46,682
Suppose a long time ago, it was...

490
00:39:46,807 --> 00:39:47,957
architecture.

491
00:39:50,723 --> 00:39:52,471
There was a year there where

492
00:39:52,596 --> 00:39:55,153
I scribbled floor plans
on everything.

493
00:39:55,942 --> 00:39:59,206
Dining room table,
patio tiles, rare books...

494
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:01,214
Drove my parents crazy.

495
00:40:03,866 --> 00:40:05,216
How old were you?

496
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:08,724
I don't know, eight, maybe nine.

497
00:40:12,815 --> 00:40:16,402
I tell you one thing, though,
I had some frakking amazing ideas.

498
00:40:19,947 --> 00:40:22,534
Restaurants shaped like food.

499
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:30,677
And top-heavy buildings, and stairways,
everything had to have a stairway.

500
00:40:41,193 --> 00:40:42,393
Spoils of war.

501
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:47,220
When I was older,

502
00:40:47,744 --> 00:40:49,094
then it became...

503
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,281
medicine and...

504
00:40:52,109 --> 00:40:53,815
engineering, photography.

505
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:56,867
I think I would've made a better
architect than any of those, though.

506
00:40:58,759 --> 00:41:00,859
And then, I discovered science.

507
00:41:01,243 --> 00:41:02,745
And I...

508
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:06,312
I thought I was really,
really good at it.

509
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:08,681
Until I met you.

510
00:41:18,593 --> 00:41:20,093
- Felix...
- Don't.

511
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:26,515
And please, no religion.

512
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:37,744
I'm fine with how things have
worked out. Really, Gaius, I am. I...

513
00:41:47,811 --> 00:41:49,011
I just hope...

514
00:41:49,585 --> 00:41:50,785
I hope that...

515
00:41:53,069 --> 00:41:54,319
people realize,

516
00:41:56,416 --> 00:41:57,566
eventually...

517
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:02,285
who I am.

518
00:42:05,547 --> 00:42:07,347
I know who you are, Felix.

519
00:42:11,423 --> 00:42:12,873
I know who you are.

520
00:42:42,821 --> 00:42:43,530
Ready.

521
00:42:50,272 --> 00:42:51,272
Aim.

522
00:42:57,049 --> 00:42:58,099
It stopped.

523
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:00,243
Fire.
