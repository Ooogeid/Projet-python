<i>Previously on </i>
Battlestar Galactica...

2
00:00:06,257 --> 00:00:07,951
If that's me, then what am I?

3
00:00:08,076 --> 00:00:10,325
She took these
from her own mortal remains.

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:12,678
The blood on these dog tags

5
00:00:13,283 --> 00:00:15,389
is 100% proof positive match

6
00:00:16,067 --> 00:00:18,027
for one Kara Thrace.

7
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,109
We tried hooking him up
to the main power grid.

8
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:29,074
Thought it might
reset his neural net.

9
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,784
It's happening all over the ship.
Power surges, temperature fluctuations.

10
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:35,367
And now you're telling me
it's been him all along?

11
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:39,413
- Is that for me?
- Hera wrote the notes

12
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:43,073
to a song that my father
used to play to me when I was a child.

13
00:00:43,198 --> 00:00:45,766
The same song that led us to Earth.

14
00:00:45,891 --> 00:00:48,141
There's a pattern that I can't see.

15
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,200
But I think that you can.

16
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:53,450
So we are going to pick it apart
until we figure it out.

17
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,806
- It's impossible. Somebody saw her.
- What the hell's going on up there?

18
00:00:57,135 --> 00:00:59,600
Boomer took Hera,
just walked right out of the daycare.

19
00:01:03,638 --> 00:01:05,314
Job well done.
Go get some rest.

20
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:08,693
Don't worry.
We'll take good care of her.

21
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:10,828
No, Boomer!

22
00:01:11,225 --> 00:01:12,988
If Cavil's plan was to steal Hera

23
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,825
so he could study her,
they'll take her to the colony.

24
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:18,831
That's where we and the Centurions
went after the first war.

25
00:01:25,014 --> 00:01:26,919
We're abandoning ship, Tigh.

26
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,700
Put out the orders that I want the crew
to start stripping down Galactica,

27
00:01:30,825 --> 00:01:32,975
packing all the weapons and gear.

28
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,082
I want to start offloading the civilians
by tomorrow.

29
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:39,355
Full crew and ordinances transferred
by the end of the week.

30
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:42,487
To Galactica,
best ship of the fleet.

31
00:01:43,444 --> 00:01:44,725
To Galactica.

BATTLESTAR GALACTICA

Subtitles
-=( Lords of Kobol )=-

34
00:03:07,652 --> 00:03:12,240
I've commanded two Battlestars
and three escorts before that.

35
00:03:12,365 --> 00:03:15,740
Come on, Bill. Don't be like that.
There's nothing to get all upset about.

36
00:03:15,865 --> 00:03:18,222
Billions of cubits worth
of equipment entrusted to me

37
00:03:18,347 --> 00:03:20,199
not to mention thousands of lives.

38
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,022
It's one hour of your life.

39
00:03:22,486 --> 00:03:26,046
Look, sometimes there are things
you just gotta do, all right?

40
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:45,824
You always drink and drive?

41
00:03:48,573 --> 00:03:50,936
I drink, he drives.

42
00:03:53,136 --> 00:03:55,786
You like having things done for you,
don't you?

43
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:59,653
Certainly beats having to do them
for yourself.

44
00:04:02,945 --> 00:04:03,945
Don't you?

45
00:04:04,698 --> 00:04:07,948
No, I prefer not to rely on others
as much as possible.

46
00:04:09,637 --> 00:04:12,084
Less chance
of being let down that way.

47
00:04:19,882 --> 00:04:21,406
Since you allowed yourself

48
00:04:21,531 --> 00:04:24,680
to be in my capable hands
for this evening,

49
00:04:27,197 --> 00:04:29,446
here's hoping I won't let you down.

50
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,960
I'll drink to that, Doctor.

51
00:04:40,386 --> 00:04:41,439
You can...

52
00:04:42,892 --> 00:04:45,837
You can call me Gaius,
actually, if you want.

53
00:04:48,386 --> 00:04:51,536
This is crazy,
but I've actually forgotten your name.

54
00:05:04,321 --> 00:05:05,321
Hello.

55
00:05:06,255 --> 00:05:07,305
Yes, it is.

56
00:05:08,091 --> 00:05:09,791
Hello. How are you?

57
00:05:10,387 --> 00:05:11,387
What?

58
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:13,446
What?

59
00:05:16,136 --> 00:05:18,023
My Gods. When was this?

60
00:05:19,774 --> 00:05:22,808
Well, listen, just...
I'm so sorry.

61
00:05:23,074 --> 00:05:26,724
If you just wait there,
and I'll be around as soon as I can...

62
00:05:27,636 --> 00:05:29,262
No, please. You have to wait.

63
00:05:29,387 --> 00:05:31,537
You have to...
You can't meet...

64
00:05:32,946 --> 00:05:36,009
You will wait there
or I'll sue you for abandonment.

65
00:05:36,134 --> 00:05:37,284
Yeah, I will.

66
00:05:38,948 --> 00:05:42,248
Well, I don't know how long
it's gonna take. Just wait.

67
00:05:42,903 --> 00:05:44,873
I'm coming.
I'm coming right now.

68
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,423
- Give my love to Sydney!
- I will! Bye bye.

69
00:05:57,397 --> 00:05:59,145
That was a great shower.

70
00:06:00,665 --> 00:06:02,476
Oh, my Gods.

71
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,906
That was amazing.
Just gonna clean up a little bit here.

72
00:06:06,938 --> 00:06:08,388
Laura, no cleaning.

73
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,383
No. This is the last bottle
and you and I have to share it.

74
00:06:12,508 --> 00:06:14,999
You promised me
you would finish all the champagne.

75
00:06:15,314 --> 00:06:16,834
Boy. We drank a lot.

76
00:06:17,258 --> 00:06:19,008
- Well, they did.
- They did.

77
00:06:19,133 --> 00:06:20,333
What about me?

78
00:06:22,061 --> 00:06:24,061
Pregnant girls only get gifts.

79
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,993
- Just a sip.
- A sip?

80
00:06:26,451 --> 00:06:27,386
All right.

81
00:06:27,555 --> 00:06:29,632
- Just one little.
- Little.

82
00:06:29,757 --> 00:06:30,757
Go ahead.

83
00:06:32,386 --> 00:06:33,386
Enough.

84
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:35,978
My gosh.

85
00:06:38,461 --> 00:06:41,258
That was lovely, Laura. Thank you.

86
00:06:41,383 --> 00:06:45,157
Well, it's the least I can do
for my little sister.

87
00:06:46,134 --> 00:06:48,634
I thought I was your little sister.

88
00:06:51,323 --> 00:06:55,286
Okay,
you are my really little sister.

89
00:06:58,384 --> 00:06:59,384
Oh, boy.

90
00:07:01,512 --> 00:07:04,012
How about that woman
with Mrs. Anderson?

91
00:07:06,322 --> 00:07:08,819
- Why did she bring those?
- Who was she?

92
00:07:08,944 --> 00:07:12,347
I don't know.
But, you know, there's always one.

93
00:07:24,821 --> 00:07:26,321
Frak me. He's early.

94
00:07:28,261 --> 00:07:29,461
Just a second!

95
00:07:33,635 --> 00:07:34,635
Coming!

96
00:07:40,633 --> 00:07:42,711
- Hi, I'm...
- You must be... Lee.

97
00:07:45,192 --> 00:07:47,049
I'm sorry. I'm Kara. Come on in.

98
00:07:48,663 --> 00:07:50,695
That's very nice.
You didn't have to do that.

99
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,012
I'll take those.

100
00:07:52,508 --> 00:07:53,806
Put 'em in some water.

101
00:07:54,061 --> 00:07:55,061
Zak!

102
00:07:56,945 --> 00:07:57,945
Nice place.

103
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,719
It's a rattrap,
but the rent's cheap.

104
00:08:01,133 --> 00:08:02,383
No. It's...

105
00:08:03,385 --> 00:08:04,691
It's got real charm.

106
00:08:05,071 --> 00:08:07,945
And you're a terrible liar.
We should play cards.

107
00:08:08,114 --> 00:08:10,507
- I hold my own.
- I'm sure you do.

108
00:08:12,107 --> 00:08:13,979
You just get uglier every day.

109
00:08:14,104 --> 00:08:16,154
Hey, there he is.
How are you?

110
00:08:18,445 --> 00:08:21,664
I see you've met my better half.
This one's mine. Keep your hands off.

111
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:24,088
And a girlfriend stealer for a brother.
Nice!

112
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:25,869
Never stole his girlfriend.

113
00:08:26,397 --> 00:08:30,043
- He's a really bad liar right here.
- No, we figured that out already.

114
00:08:31,024 --> 00:08:32,650
Zak, get the drinks.

115
00:08:33,476 --> 00:08:35,658
- Dinner's almost ready.
- Yes, sir.

116
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,107
I don't know what to say.
It was a mistake.

117
00:08:40,232 --> 00:08:43,021
Nothing in my contract about
being stabbed with a steak knife.

118
00:08:43,146 --> 00:08:46,483
She been stealing
while I've been sleeping.

119
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:49,230
No one is stealing from you,
dad, all right?

120
00:08:49,355 --> 00:08:51,437
Just shut up.
You're in enough trouble already.

121
00:08:51,562 --> 00:08:54,283
I'm out of here.
You're lucky I don't call the cops.

122
00:08:54,847 --> 00:08:58,562
Yes, we are, nurse Barbara. Thank you.
Now listen. I'll pay you double.

123
00:08:58,687 --> 00:09:01,009
Triple. I thought I asked you
to wait in the car.

124
00:09:01,134 --> 00:09:03,375
This be the new one you be banging?

125
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:06,920
None of your business.
Nurse, I've got 500 cubits. 1,000.

126
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:09,883
1,000 frakking cubits for you
to stay the night! Please!

127
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:12,617
I'll take all the knives away!
He'll be on liquid diet forever.

128
00:09:12,742 --> 00:09:14,606
Just spend one frakking night!

129
00:09:14,731 --> 00:09:16,295
How about you, love?

130
00:09:16,713 --> 00:09:18,796
Bet you charge a lot more than that?

131
00:09:18,921 --> 00:09:21,365
Shut your filthy mouth.
Stop being so disgusting.

132
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:24,712
- This is your father, Gaius.
- Not that you'd ever know it.

133
00:09:24,837 --> 00:09:27,345
- Gaius is ashamed of his family.
- I need this.

134
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,681
I need this
like a frakking hole in the head.

135
00:09:29,806 --> 00:09:32,145
Stupid bastard
actually changed his accent.

136
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:36,224
- Would you believe that?
- That is the third nurse in a row.

137
00:09:36,528 --> 00:09:37,991
The third nurse.

138
00:09:40,937 --> 00:09:42,885
Do you have any idea
how much this is costing?

139
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,857
How much it costs.

140
00:09:44,982 --> 00:09:46,900
That's all he cares about now.

141
00:09:47,701 --> 00:09:50,242
Not the way he was brought up,
I can tell ya.

142
00:09:50,367 --> 00:09:52,221
But he don't like to think
about that.

143
00:09:52,346 --> 00:09:55,191
No, he don't like to think
about living on the farm

144
00:09:55,316 --> 00:09:57,834
- and doing a day's hard work.
- All right.

145
00:09:57,959 --> 00:09:59,931
Enough!
Shut up!

146
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,245
Shut up right now!

147
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:04,449
I won't stand here one moment longer
and listen to your ridiculous

148
00:10:04,574 --> 00:10:07,022
working class hero rant.
Look at you!

149
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,026
Look at your shirt
that I bought you.

150
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:12,980
How you dribble and treat these things.
I'll break it down for you, dad!

151
00:10:13,105 --> 00:10:16,644
You're an obnoxious, spiteful,
cantankerous old git,

152
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:19,438
and you're frakking lucky
not living on the frakking street!

153
00:10:19,563 --> 00:10:22,423
Big man cursing his father.

154
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:25,265
Makes you feel important, does it?

155
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:30,075
- Gaius, maybe we should...
- Maybe you should've stayed in the car,

156
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,265
which is what I asked you to do.

157
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,675
I'm going to have
to ask you to leave now.

158
00:10:35,689 --> 00:10:38,688
I'm sure that the driver
can see you to your home.

159
00:10:39,619 --> 00:10:43,134
I'm gonna spend the rest
of this lovely evening with my dad.

160
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:45,352
Good night.

161
00:11:11,285 --> 00:11:13,330
Good morning.
I'm officer Stephanie

162
00:11:13,455 --> 00:11:16,073
and this is officer Shawn
with the Caprica city police.

163
00:11:16,198 --> 00:11:17,794
Are you Laura Roslin?

164
00:11:20,122 --> 00:11:21,142
Yes, I am.

165
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,653
We need to speak with you.
May we come inside?

166
00:11:23,778 --> 00:11:25,161
Yes, please do.

167
00:11:48,152 --> 00:11:51,928
We're so sorry we have to inform you
there's been a terrible accident.

168
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:55,872
Late last night, your sisters
and your father were all killed.

169
00:11:55,997 --> 00:11:58,584
We weren't able to verify

170
00:11:58,955 --> 00:12:02,031
the identity of the bodies
until a few hours ago.

171
00:12:02,233 --> 00:12:03,889
The driver of the other vehicle

172
00:12:04,272 --> 00:12:05,949
is in stable condition.

173
00:12:06,438 --> 00:12:10,357
And preliminary tests
indicate he was intoxicated

174
00:12:10,761 --> 00:12:14,359
when he sideswiped the car
with your father and your sisters.

175
00:12:16,979 --> 00:12:19,170
Thank you.
Please show yourselves out.

176
00:12:19,295 --> 00:12:21,125
We're sorry for your loss.

177
00:13:46,797 --> 00:13:48,618
I don't know what she's doing.

178
00:14:48,405 --> 00:14:50,334
There's only so much
of Galactica to go around.

179
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:52,373
You'd think
we're retiring ten Battlestars.

180
00:14:52,498 --> 00:14:54,159
- Excuse me.
- One second.

181
00:14:54,284 --> 00:14:57,352
Tell the captains
they are padding their requests.

182
00:14:57,477 --> 00:14:59,383
- Send it back.
- Sir, if you have a minute.

183
00:14:59,508 --> 00:15:00,899
Just one second.

184
00:15:02,542 --> 00:15:03,957
Specialist, what is it?

185
00:15:04,082 --> 00:15:06,073
I know this is not your problem,
Sir, but

186
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:09,392
they want us to tear the mag cellerators
from the launch tubes.

187
00:15:09,517 --> 00:15:12,230
Well, the civilian ships
can use them as auto-loaders.

188
00:15:12,355 --> 00:15:15,262
Sir, it's like we're tearing
the old girl's heart out.

189
00:15:15,387 --> 00:15:17,874
A Battlestar's whole purpose
is to launch Vipers.

190
00:15:18,193 --> 00:15:21,555
I kind of know how you feel.
Part of my heart's here too.

191
00:15:24,151 --> 00:15:25,423
Tell you what...

192
00:15:25,548 --> 00:15:28,502
Make the cellerators
the last thing your men take out.

193
00:15:28,908 --> 00:15:32,047
Then turn out the lights
and let the old girl die in peace.

194
00:15:33,409 --> 00:15:34,471
Yes, sir.

195
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:25,347
Well, after the blast,
everyone else's numbers are down,

196
00:16:25,472 --> 00:16:29,416
which gives us solid majorities on over
half the civilian ships in the fleet.

197
00:16:29,896 --> 00:16:33,408
I mean, no one else comes even close
to having that kind of political power.

198
00:16:33,865 --> 00:16:35,567
Our time is here, Gaius.

199
00:16:36,823 --> 00:16:38,230
She's right, Gaius.

200
00:16:39,157 --> 00:16:41,138
The end times are approaching.

201
00:16:41,263 --> 00:16:44,628
Humanity's final chapter's
about to be written and you...

202
00:16:46,403 --> 00:16:47,839
you will be its author.

203
00:16:49,336 --> 00:16:51,123
Gaius, did you hear me?

204
00:16:51,248 --> 00:16:52,302
This is it.

205
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:55,673
This is it, Gaius.

206
00:17:07,035 --> 00:17:08,071
Are you...

207
00:17:09,184 --> 00:17:10,768
you thirsty before...

208
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:18,161
What are you doing here?

209
00:17:21,562 --> 00:17:23,041
How did you get in here?

210
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,618
- Should I...
- What you should do

211
00:17:27,743 --> 00:17:30,268
is go up those stairs, turn left,

212
00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:33,243
go in the bedroom, and get ready.

213
00:17:40,956 --> 00:17:45,083
You are an intruder in my home.
I think it would be a good idea

214
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,607
if you left
before inform the authorities.

215
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,515
If that's the way
you wanna play it, then...

216
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,540
then I'm ringing the police.

217
00:17:58,494 --> 00:17:59,911
Police department, please.

218
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,924
- I found your father a place to live.
- Yes, I'd like to re...

219
00:18:06,929 --> 00:18:07,794
What?

220
00:18:08,111 --> 00:18:09,266
The Regency.

221
00:18:10,148 --> 00:18:13,038
Down by the wharf.
Very tony address.

222
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:16,550
Full-time care,
social activities, medical staff.

223
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:18,696
And the best part,

224
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,250
they encourage residents to garden
and grow their own food.

225
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,370
Julius will be a farmer again.

226
00:18:29,715 --> 00:18:32,919
His things are being moved
this very moment by the staff.

227
00:18:34,186 --> 00:18:36,155
They'll be set up
in his new room exactly

228
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,821
how he had them in the apartment.

229
00:18:37,946 --> 00:18:38,955
He loves it.

230
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,043
Loves?

231
00:18:47,203 --> 00:18:49,139
Once I showed him around
the facility.

232
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:54,734
Your father's a very complicated man,
Gaius, but there's a few

233
00:18:54,859 --> 00:18:57,654
simple things
that make him very happy.

234
00:19:10,007 --> 00:19:11,861
The last time I saw him...

235
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:14,347
he seemed happy.

236
00:19:59,374 --> 00:20:00,470
Sorry, sir.

237
00:20:01,472 --> 00:20:02,575
As I was saying,

238
00:20:03,511 --> 00:20:06,612
the old man intends to fly
the last Viper off ship himself.

239
00:20:06,737 --> 00:20:08,873
Tell the deck gang
to leave one launch tube intact,

240
00:20:09,189 --> 00:20:11,837
- set to remote pilot launch.
- Yes, sir.

241
00:20:16,536 --> 00:20:18,971
You'll never make Admiral like that.

242
00:20:20,624 --> 00:20:22,223
They're all the same, Karl.

243
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:25,383
<i>No, they're different.</i>

244
00:20:26,907 --> 00:20:28,185
<i>You know they're different.</i>

245
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,917
How you felt about Boomer,
that was different.

246
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,899
That's why you did what you did.

247
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,398
<i>I did what I did
because I'm a frakkin' idiot.</i>

248
00:20:38,334 --> 00:20:39,710
<i>A 2,000-year-old idiot</i>

249
00:20:39,835 --> 00:20:41,990
<i>who cannot learn
the simplest lesson.</i>

250
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:44,080
Machines are not people.

251
00:20:44,635 --> 00:20:46,334
They're just machines.

252
00:20:46,531 --> 00:20:47,541
<i>My wife,</i>

253
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:49,790
<i>Athena,</i>

254
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:51,636
<i>is a person.</i>

255
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,429
<i>She's a blow-up doll, Karl.
They all are.</i>

256
00:20:55,044 --> 00:20:58,338
<i>Athena, Sharon, Boomer. Call 'em
what you will. They're all the same.</i>

257
00:20:58,522 --> 00:21:01,683
They're all the same
because we made them the same.

258
00:21:06,334 --> 00:21:08,929
<i>Don't blame yourself,
but you can't trust 'em.</i>

259
00:21:09,521 --> 00:21:11,254
<i>You can't trust any of 'em.</i>

260
00:21:33,157 --> 00:21:34,157
Dots.

261
00:21:34,721 --> 00:21:37,485
Lots and lots and lots of dots.

262
00:21:38,648 --> 00:21:41,396
- She's clearly very gifted.
- She hasn't eaten in days.

263
00:21:41,521 --> 00:21:43,773
I think we should begin
intravenous nutritional supplements

264
00:21:43,898 --> 00:21:46,347
to build up her strength
before we begin testing.

265
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,021
She wants her mother.

266
00:21:48,146 --> 00:21:50,460
She can't have her mother now,
can she?

267
00:21:51,112 --> 00:21:54,390
Oh, I'm sorry.
I forgot to sound all soppy and soft

268
00:21:54,515 --> 00:21:55,833
when speaking of the child.

269
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:58,035
She is a child.
A frightened one.

270
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:01,817
She's a half human,
half machine object of curiosity

271
00:22:01,942 --> 00:22:03,767
that holds the key
to our continued existence

272
00:22:03,892 --> 00:22:06,040
somewhere in her genetic code.

273
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:09,480
So let's get a tube
in her and get her ready.

274
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:32,091
Frak. You didn't hear that,
all right?

275
00:22:32,216 --> 00:22:33,589
Let me help you.

276
00:22:40,335 --> 00:22:42,665
- These are...
- Pilots from the memorial wall.

277
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:46,083
We wanted to take them with us, so we
wouldn't leave them with the others.

278
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:48,145
- The others.
- Lotta of photos still down there.

279
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,324
Nobody knows who they are anymore.

280
00:22:50,449 --> 00:22:52,234
Probably friends and relatives

281
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,013
of people on Galactica
who died somewhere along the way.

282
00:22:59,772 --> 00:23:00,829
As you were.

283
00:24:27,075 --> 00:24:30,099
Bear it in mind?
Well, when will you bear it in mind?

284
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:32,207
You haven't even listened
to my proposal.

285
00:24:32,332 --> 00:24:34,704
I'm not even saying
it was necessarily be me.

286
00:24:34,829 --> 00:24:37,268
My people deserve
a voice in the government.

287
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:39,637
Now, I'm literally talking
about the lives and well-being

288
00:24:39,762 --> 00:24:41,581
of thousands of people in the fleet.

289
00:24:41,706 --> 00:24:44,272
Is that what you were thinking about
when you outted Starbuck's secret?

290
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,770
The well-being
of thousands of people?

291
00:24:46,895 --> 00:24:49,927
Or the political gain
of Gaius Baltar... again?

292
00:24:51,521 --> 00:24:53,254
Is that what this is about?

293
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:57,945
Does everything have to be reduced
to your personal feelings

294
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,620
about Kara Thrace?

295
00:25:00,292 --> 00:25:01,624
Listen to me, Mr. Adama.

296
00:25:06,405 --> 00:25:08,925
I'm asking to have
a genuine conversation.

297
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,144
Please.

298
00:25:17,979 --> 00:25:19,093
Five minutes.

299
00:25:21,848 --> 00:25:24,105
I'll be back in five minutes.
Five minutes inside.

300
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:28,209
And you think there's some kind
of meaning in these musical notes.

301
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:32,796
I don't know.
I'm just groping mostly.

302
00:25:32,921 --> 00:25:34,969
Looking for patterns.
Trying to see what comes to me.

303
00:25:35,205 --> 00:25:38,806
I thought that if I assigned
numbers to the notes...

304
00:25:41,086 --> 00:25:42,143
I don't know.

305
00:25:52,955 --> 00:25:54,885
What Baltar said the other day,

306
00:25:55,647 --> 00:25:57,138
is it the truth?

307
00:26:02,017 --> 00:26:03,017
Yeah.

308
00:26:05,831 --> 00:26:07,267
I found my body

309
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,775
and I burned it on Earth.

310
00:26:13,056 --> 00:26:14,729
I don't know what I am.

311
00:26:24,151 --> 00:26:26,709
I have to ask him a question.
Do you know how to plug him in?

312
00:26:29,954 --> 00:26:30,954
Yeah.

313
00:26:35,332 --> 00:26:36,832
I know what you are.

314
00:26:38,334 --> 00:26:39,842
You're my daughter.

315
00:26:41,136 --> 00:26:42,460
Don't forget it.

316
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,769
You're on pace to land
in the hall of fame some day.

317
00:27:01,894 --> 00:27:03,745
But you still haven't won
a championship

318
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,415
and now the C-Bucs
are in a rebuilding year.

319
00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:10,203
If you don't get to hoist
the cup before you retire,

320
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:12,981
will you consider
your career to be incomplete?

321
00:27:14,689 --> 00:27:16,704
Well, right now, I'm just...

322
00:27:16,829 --> 00:27:18,386
focused on getting stronger

323
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:21,347
and helping out the team
any way I can.

324
00:27:32,579 --> 00:27:34,318
Look, you want to know the truth?

325
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:41,328
I don't really care
about the stats or the cup

326
00:27:41,453 --> 00:27:43,522
or the trophy or anything like that.

327
00:27:44,266 --> 00:27:46,703
In fact, even the games
aren't that important to me.

328
00:27:46,828 --> 00:27:47,828
Not really.

329
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,136
What matters to me is...

330
00:27:50,816 --> 00:27:53,703
the perfect throw, okay?

331
00:27:53,828 --> 00:27:57,832
Making the perfect catch.
The perfect step and block.

332
00:27:59,643 --> 00:28:02,202
It's perfection.
That's what it's about.

333
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:06,605
It's about those moments when you...

334
00:28:08,925 --> 00:28:12,723
When you can feel
the perfection of creation.

335
00:28:14,351 --> 00:28:17,927
The... the beauty of physics.
The wonder of mathematics.

336
00:28:18,052 --> 00:28:20,802
You know, the... the elation

337
00:28:20,927 --> 00:28:23,987
of action and reaction.

338
00:28:24,112 --> 00:28:27,551
And that is the kind of perfection
that I wanna be connected to.

339
00:28:28,405 --> 00:28:30,118
Spins and turns.
Angles and curves.

340
00:28:30,243 --> 00:28:32,551
The shape of dreams half-remembered.

341
00:28:32,676 --> 00:28:35,588
Slip the surly bonds of Earth
and touch the face of perfection.

342
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:38,007
A perfect face.
Perfect lace.

343
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:40,155
Find a perfect world
for the end of Kara Thrace.

344
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:41,344
End of line.

345
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:44,250
He says a lot of things.

346
00:28:45,342 --> 00:28:47,099
Go ahead.
Ask your question.

347
00:28:49,631 --> 00:28:50,810
You ask him.

348
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:06,592
Let's forget
you're the son of the admiral.

349
00:29:06,717 --> 00:29:08,196
Shut the frak up.

350
00:29:08,953 --> 00:29:11,457
Get to the frakkin' point.
You got five minutes. Speak.

351
00:29:12,363 --> 00:29:14,762
Galactica has been more
than our guardian.

352
00:29:15,677 --> 00:29:19,632
She's literally a vessel into which we
have poured all of our hopes and dreams.

353
00:29:20,113 --> 00:29:21,613
And when she's gone,

354
00:29:22,425 --> 00:29:24,678
when we can no longer
derive the security

355
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:27,473
from looking out a window
and seeing her massive bulk gliding by,

356
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,049
then this life will be over

357
00:29:30,925 --> 00:29:32,871
and a new life will have begun.

358
00:29:33,822 --> 00:29:34,946
A new life

359
00:29:35,628 --> 00:29:37,691
that requires a new way of thinking.

360
00:29:38,237 --> 00:29:41,082
Now, I am willing to do anything...

361
00:29:42,339 --> 00:29:43,599
anything I can

362
00:29:44,299 --> 00:29:46,391
to make this new life a good one.

363
00:29:46,516 --> 00:29:49,359
All I am asking is that my people

364
00:29:50,373 --> 00:29:52,415
have a voice in the government.

365
00:29:53,299 --> 00:29:54,899
I represent thousands of people.

366
00:29:55,051 --> 00:29:58,201
They deserve to be enfranchised
just as much as anyone else.

367
00:29:58,326 --> 00:30:00,176
I'm not talking about myself.

368
00:30:00,301 --> 00:30:02,299
This is not for me personally.

369
00:30:02,861 --> 00:30:04,157
Come on, Lee.

370
00:30:04,916 --> 00:30:06,097
It makes sense.

371
00:30:08,518 --> 00:30:10,553
You know it's the right thing to do.

372
00:30:14,213 --> 00:30:15,489
What I know...

373
00:30:17,235 --> 00:30:19,981
Is that in all the years
that I've known you, I've never seen you

374
00:30:20,106 --> 00:30:22,528
- make one truly selfless act.
- Right.

375
00:30:22,697 --> 00:30:25,342
Never seen you do something
that didn't on some level

376
00:30:25,467 --> 00:30:27,613
serve the greater needs
of Gaius frakking Baltar.

377
00:30:27,738 --> 00:30:29,635
So, no, I won't take your hand.

378
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:32,286
And I won't bring you

379
00:30:32,591 --> 00:30:35,990
or any representative
from your movement into the government.

380
00:30:36,115 --> 00:30:39,924
Right. So that's
what it boils down to.

381
00:30:40,049 --> 00:30:42,549
My people can't get representation

382
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,092
because I personally haven't passed

383
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,303
Lee Adama's selfless altruism test.

384
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:49,528
I haven't been a goody-goody
and won a badge of honor.

385
00:30:49,653 --> 00:30:52,455
I don't think you've passed
Gaius Baltar's test.

386
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:55,002
Go ahead, look me in the eye
and tell me about the time

387
00:30:55,127 --> 00:30:57,610
that you made a truly
heroic act of conscience

388
00:30:57,735 --> 00:31:00,149
which helped you
not even in the slightest.

389
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:02,413
Tell me!
I'll even believe you.

390
00:31:07,133 --> 00:31:08,296
You're right.

391
00:31:10,534 --> 00:31:11,826
I wouldn't trust me either.

392
00:31:26,644 --> 00:31:27,644
Holy frak.

393
00:31:35,554 --> 00:31:36,604
I dare you.

394
00:31:37,656 --> 00:31:39,256
I double-dog dare you.

395
00:31:54,982 --> 00:31:56,782
Get out of here!
Come on!

396
00:32:01,236 --> 00:32:02,236
Come on!

397
00:32:06,506 --> 00:32:07,508
Attaboy!

398
00:32:10,221 --> 00:32:11,221
Frak.

399
00:32:17,494 --> 00:32:19,044
Stupid frakkin' bird.

400
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,019
Can I have your attention, please?

401
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:12,354
I'm sure you're all aware that a child
was abducted from this ship recently.

402
00:33:13,031 --> 00:33:16,188
I thought that a rescue mission
was impractical.

403
00:33:18,682 --> 00:33:20,082
Well, I was wrong.

404
00:33:20,386 --> 00:33:23,210
He didn't say
where he got the information but

405
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:25,461
Starbuck was there,
so I bet he talked to Anders.

406
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,370
Yeah. I know.
Pretty freaky.

407
00:33:28,495 --> 00:33:30,631
He thought
a rescue mission was impractical

408
00:33:30,756 --> 00:33:32,894
because he didn't know
where she was being held.

409
00:33:33,019 --> 00:33:34,607
But that's changed now, I guess,

410
00:33:34,732 --> 00:33:37,369
because he does know
where she's being held.

411
00:33:38,678 --> 00:33:40,059
Knowing where the colony is

412
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:43,820
is not nearly the same thing
as being able to actually get her out.

413
00:33:43,945 --> 00:33:46,345
This is insane.
You know that, right?

414
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:49,862
Hera has some meaning
that transcends the here and now.

415
00:33:49,987 --> 00:33:52,571
She's meant to fulfill a role
just as we were.

416
00:33:52,768 --> 00:33:54,918
So we're going... the five of us.

417
00:33:55,414 --> 00:33:57,846
You're making decisions
for all of us now.

418
00:33:57,971 --> 00:34:01,121
You'll go, Tory.
Truth is, you never could be alone.

419
00:34:02,171 --> 00:34:05,084
Yeah, the mission is to be
strictly volunteer only.

420
00:34:05,728 --> 00:34:08,187
Any man or woman over the age of 15.

421
00:34:08,894 --> 00:34:12,694
And the Admiral also wants
any former colonial officer or crewmen

422
00:34:12,822 --> 00:34:15,172
incarcerated
after the recent mutiny.

423
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,064
Yeah. That's it.

424
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:24,562
Everyone has to make their own choice
and they have to do it in person.

425
00:34:25,147 --> 00:34:27,441
The old man is waiting
on the hangar deck.

426
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:29,999
Set in-port watch
until you get back.

427
00:34:30,281 --> 00:34:33,090
Watch keepers
report to the Admiral's quarters

428
00:34:33,215 --> 00:34:35,315
to declare yourselves in person.

429
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:37,783
Move.

430
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:41,407
- You know what you're gonna do?
- Not exactly.

431
00:34:41,532 --> 00:34:42,975
Well, take your time.

432
00:34:43,861 --> 00:34:46,961
Takes approximately four minutes
to get down there.

433
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,900
It's really happening.

434
00:34:51,309 --> 00:34:52,909
We're going after her.

435
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:55,430
Or what's left of her.

436
00:34:56,401 --> 00:34:58,350
Cavil's probably had her
sliced and diced

437
00:34:58,475 --> 00:35:00,723
- and cut up into a thousand specimens.
- Stop it.

438
00:35:00,892 --> 00:35:02,910
Just stop it.

439
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:05,314
She's still alive.

440
00:35:05,439 --> 00:35:07,791
And she's till out there.
And we're gonna get her.

441
00:35:07,916 --> 00:35:10,149
And everything's gonna be all right.

442
00:35:10,473 --> 00:35:12,673
It's not gonna be all right, Karl.

443
00:35:16,758 --> 00:35:17,908
You're wrong.

444
00:35:19,136 --> 00:35:20,286
You're wrong.

445
00:35:32,186 --> 00:35:35,075
I know it's been three months.
I know that.

446
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:38,380
I do too go out.
I do.

447
00:35:40,158 --> 00:35:41,158
I do.

448
00:35:47,573 --> 00:35:50,473
No, I'm not joining
Adar's presidential campaign.

449
00:35:50,705 --> 00:35:51,855
I don't care.

450
00:35:53,752 --> 00:35:55,682
Because I don't like politics
to begin with

451
00:35:55,807 --> 00:35:57,791
and a national campaign
is just so...

452
00:35:59,981 --> 00:36:00,981
Gods,

453
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,186
you are relentless.

454
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,910
I'll make you a deal.

455
00:36:09,176 --> 00:36:10,626
I'll go on the date

456
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:13,796
if you'll stop bugging me
about this campaign.

457
00:36:18,573 --> 00:36:19,873
How young is he?

458
00:36:23,286 --> 00:36:24,436
I know.

459
00:36:25,331 --> 00:36:26,391
I made a deal.

460
00:36:27,487 --> 00:36:29,287
What's Mr. Perfect's name?

461
00:36:30,089 --> 00:36:32,859
Sean. I like that name.
Sean what?

462
00:36:34,376 --> 00:36:36,089
Sean Allison?

463
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:38,228
Sounds familiar.

464
00:36:39,464 --> 00:36:40,764
All right.
Bye.

465
00:37:07,146 --> 00:37:10,978
No one should feel obligated
to join this mission

466
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:12,489
in any way!

467
00:37:15,238 --> 00:37:17,028
This is a decision

468
00:37:18,051 --> 00:37:20,352
I have made for myself.

469
00:37:22,542 --> 00:37:23,792
If it turns out

470
00:37:24,714 --> 00:37:28,371
that there are not enough personnel
to crew Galactica...

471
00:37:31,588 --> 00:37:34,277
I will lead a Raptor assault

472
00:37:34,925 --> 00:37:38,380
with anyone
who is willing to join me.

473
00:37:41,761 --> 00:37:44,019
Let there be no illusions!

474
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,584
This is likely to be

475
00:37:47,095 --> 00:37:48,765
a one-way trip.

476
00:37:49,082 --> 00:37:52,039
So don't volunteer out of sentiment

477
00:37:52,248 --> 00:37:53,586
or emotion.

478
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,394
There is a line running down
this deck.

479
00:38:09,282 --> 00:38:10,628
Volunteers,

480
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:13,288
move to the starboard side!

481
00:38:13,905 --> 00:38:15,490
Everyone else,

482
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:17,019
to the port.

483
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:53,169
Make your choice.

484
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:14,239
Doc.

485
00:39:17,211 --> 00:39:19,564
The fleet can't afford
to lose a Doctor.

486
00:39:20,017 --> 00:39:21,500
Go on back, Sherman.

487
00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:23,019
And thank you.

488
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:40,593
Like you got something better to do.

489
00:40:13,308 --> 00:40:15,464
Excuse me.
Thank you.

490
00:40:28,188 --> 00:40:29,697
You didn't think

491
00:40:29,822 --> 00:40:32,483
you were gonna take off without me,
Admiral, did you?

492
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:36,123
Never crossed my mind,
Madam President.

493
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,672
Jump complete.
Frak!

494
00:41:09,608 --> 00:41:12,595
- Plot us a way back out of here.
- Right. You got it.

495
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:16,556
<i>Figures that a brain damaged Cylon
would send us in an asteroid field.</i>

496
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,809
The more things change,
the more they stay the same.

497
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:21,228
You got a recon mission
where someone needs

498
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:23,432
to hang their ass over the edge
and wait for a bite,

499
00:41:23,557 --> 00:41:26,353
- send Racetrack and Skulls.
- Well, beats sittin' in a cell.

500
00:41:26,478 --> 00:41:28,318
Long range dradis
just picked something up.

501
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,220
Holy frak,
we're right on top of a singularity.

502
00:41:31,345 --> 00:41:33,708
A black hole? Where away?

503
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:37,410
738 carom 882.
We're already sliding toward it.

504
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:46,378
Spin up the FTL.
We're getting out of here.

505
00:41:48,842 --> 00:41:50,132
Frak me.

506
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,850
- What?
- You're not gonna believe this.

507
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,922
Based on the coordinates
we got from Sam,

508
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:59,623
we've determined
that the Cylon Colony is located here.

509
00:41:59,748 --> 00:42:02,302
It's within our jump range,
but there's a sizable catch.

510
00:42:02,427 --> 00:42:05,435
It's located within an accretion disk
of a naked singularity.

511
00:42:05,828 --> 00:42:08,227
It's a strategically sound position.

512
00:42:08,352 --> 00:42:10,913
The Colony's bound within
the gravity well of the black hole,

513
00:42:11,038 --> 00:42:13,697
- but maintains a stable orbit.
- How do we get in there?

514
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:15,915
Look at all the crap
floating around in that current.

515
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:19,239
There's no way to navigate that current.
The tidal stresses are too strong.

516
00:42:19,364 --> 00:42:21,638
It would rip the ship apart
before we got within ten SU.

517
00:42:21,763 --> 00:42:24,544
There is one safe jump spot. It's where
they bring their baseships in and out.

518
00:42:24,669 --> 00:42:26,882
We got lucky.
Two baseships jumped in and out

519
00:42:27,007 --> 00:42:28,814
while the Raptor
was taking pictures.

520
00:42:28,939 --> 00:42:32,051
This right here is our only
parking spot.

521
00:42:32,366 --> 00:42:34,349
That's right on top
of the frakking thing.

522
00:42:34,474 --> 00:42:37,298
- Less than one click by our estimates.
- One click?

523
00:42:37,529 --> 00:42:38,724
Point blank range.

524
00:42:38,849 --> 00:42:42,197
And you can bet that
they will have every gun in that colony

525
00:42:42,322 --> 00:42:44,295
pointed at that parking spot
of yours.

526
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:47,491
That's what I'd do.
Leave only one way in and out

527
00:42:48,062 --> 00:42:50,444
then make it impossible
to get past the gates.

528
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:55,838
All right.

529
00:43:03,012 --> 00:43:04,497
Let's get to work.

530
00:43:09,151 --> 00:43:13,155
Thank you for watching Galactica
