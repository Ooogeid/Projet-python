00:00:19,481 --> 00:00:22,041
<i>Previously on</i>
Battlestar Galactica...

2
00:00:22,161 --> 00:00:23,511
Madame President,

3
00:00:23,631 --> 00:00:25,321
are you taking Chamalla again?

4
00:00:25,441 --> 00:00:27,681
I am taking Chamalla again

5
00:00:27,801 --> 00:00:29,681
because my cancer has returned.

6
00:00:30,241 --> 00:00:33,161
I remember a flashing triple star,

7
00:00:33,281 --> 00:00:35,801
a giant gas planet with rings,

8
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,440
and a comet.

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,081
What's the latest, Felix?

10
00:00:39,201 --> 00:00:41,961
She's reversing course.
Returning to sector seven.

11
00:00:42,081 --> 00:00:45,031
- That is the tenth course correction.
- Frak me.

12
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,879
They're going to attack.
Alert the others.

13
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:50,641
We need to jump now.

14
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:53,721
Just remember,

15
00:00:53,841 --> 00:00:56,279
- <i>they </i>started it.
- But we're killing them.

16
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,084
We are truly killing them.

17
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:00,759
Dradis contact.

18
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,839
I've got visual. Cylon heavy Raider.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,121
<i>Kara, I'm alone. This is not an attack.</i>

20
00:01:05,241 --> 00:01:07,200
- <i>I knew I'd find you.</i>
- Leoben.

21
00:01:07,361 --> 00:01:08,441
<i>I'm here for you.</i>

22
00:01:08,561 --> 00:01:11,160
<i>To offer a truce between human and Cylon</i>

23
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,401
<i>and a chance for you
to complete your journey.</i>

24
00:01:13,521 --> 00:01:14,641
The Hybrid.

25
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,720
You need to go to her, Kara.

26
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,961
She'll tell you the way to get to Earth.

27
00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:22,401
We're done here. Get him out of here.

28
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,719
This baseship was never
part of the mission.

29
00:01:24,881 --> 00:01:27,761
If we don't leave right now,
we are all going to die.

30
00:01:27,881 --> 00:01:29,639
We're ready to jump back on your order.

31
00:01:29,801 --> 00:01:32,246
- We're not going back to the fleet.
- What are you talking about?

32
00:01:32,366 --> 00:01:33,732
We came to complete a mission,

33
00:01:33,852 --> 00:01:35,601
that baseship has
something to do with it.

34
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:38,241
Captain Thrace, as XO of the Demetrius,

35
00:01:38,361 --> 00:01:40,400
I'm hereby relieving you of command.

36
00:01:49,761 --> 00:01:51,211
You son of a bitch.

37
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:55,079
I'll do it myself.

38
00:01:56,721 --> 00:01:59,471
- What the hell are you doing?!
- Stand down!

39
00:02:05,681 --> 00:02:08,240
Order the marine guards
to the control room.

40
00:02:08,401 --> 00:02:10,800
Tell them I'm placing
Captain Thrace under arrest.

41
00:02:11,121 --> 00:02:13,561
You're wrong, Helo.
You're so godsdamn wrong.

42
00:02:13,681 --> 00:02:16,254
Either way, we're taking Leoben
and his proposal back to the fleet.

43
00:02:16,374 --> 00:02:17,721
The Admiral will sort it out.

44
00:02:17,841 --> 00:02:19,961
You're throwing away
our last chance to find Earth.

45
00:02:20,081 --> 00:02:22,080
And you'll be going back
to Galactica as mutineers.

46
00:02:22,361 --> 00:02:24,759
How do you think
the Admiral's gonna sort through that?

47
00:02:24,921 --> 00:02:25,961
That's up to him.

48
00:02:26,081 --> 00:02:29,401
M. Gaeta, reset the FTL
for the first jump back to the fleet.

49
00:02:29,921 --> 00:02:31,161
Right away, Sir.

50
00:02:35,201 --> 00:02:38,440
- We should just airlock your Cylon ass.
- I am not a Cylon.

51
00:02:41,921 --> 00:02:42,840
Gaeta, stop!

52
00:02:44,601 --> 00:02:47,601
Gaeta, abort the jump!
I said, abort the jump!

53
00:02:54,081 --> 00:02:54,801
Frak.

54
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,841
You want to know who's in charge?
Who's in command?

55
00:02:58,961 --> 00:03:00,681
- You frakkin' want to know?!
- Sam!

56
00:03:00,801 --> 00:03:02,961
It's Captain Thrace, Gods damn it!
Now let her go!

57
00:03:03,081 --> 00:03:04,241
Sergeant, stand down.

58
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:05,961
- Stand down, Sergeant!
- Medic!

59
00:03:06,081 --> 00:03:08,001
Stand down, Sergeant! That's an order!

60
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,041
Seelix, stand down! Stand down.

61
00:03:13,281 --> 00:03:14,521
What the frak?

62
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:17,471
- I need a med kit!
- Stay away from me.

63
00:03:19,721 --> 00:03:20,471
Frak!

64
00:03:23,601 --> 00:03:24,761
What the frak?

65
00:03:25,771 --> 00:03:28,521
All right, bloodstopper.
This is gonna hurt.

66
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:29,601
Ready, go.

67
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,471
Get off me, you frakkin' bitch...

68
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:37,851
Morpha.

69
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,159
We need to move him to a bunk.

70
00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:52,671
- Marines, get over here!
- Yes, Sir.

71
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,491
- Easy.
- Careful!

72
00:03:59,761 --> 00:04:02,121
Wait, listen. Kara, that was...

73
00:04:03,081 --> 00:04:05,731
So now what?
Gonna give orders at gunpoint?

74
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,401
You're right, Helo.

75
00:04:07,521 --> 00:04:10,001
I never should've ordered Demetrius
to jump to the baseship.

76
00:04:10,121 --> 00:04:12,641
Too many lives to risk
on a gut instinct.

77
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:16,201
- So Demetrius goes back to the fleet.
- Missing a Raptor.

78
00:04:16,321 --> 00:04:19,001
I'm gonna take Leoben to the baseship,
see if his story checks out.

79
00:04:19,121 --> 00:04:21,241
Are you insane? The two of you alone?

80
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:22,680
She's not going alone.

81
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:24,481
I'm going with her.

82
00:04:24,801 --> 00:04:26,751
This is crazy, but I need you.

83
00:04:27,121 --> 00:04:27,932
What?

84
00:04:28,052 --> 00:04:29,680
I need someone speaking their language.

85
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,531
If this is a trap,
I want to know about it.

86
00:04:33,401 --> 00:04:35,351
Hell, yeah, let the Cylon go.

87
00:04:36,201 --> 00:04:37,201
It's okay.

88
00:04:38,921 --> 00:04:39,971
I'll do it.

89
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,359
Listen to me. Your Raptor doesn't have
enough fuel to get back to Galactica.

90
00:04:44,521 --> 00:04:45,879
But the baseship does.

91
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:49,041
We were sent out here by the Admiral
to complete a mission.

92
00:04:49,161 --> 00:04:51,481
Not for me,
but for the people of the fleet.

93
00:04:51,601 --> 00:04:53,951
And if I'm right, the payoff is Earth.

94
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,441
Lieutenant Costanza,
what's the latest we can leave here

95
00:05:01,561 --> 00:05:04,311
and still make the rendezvous
with the fleet?

96
00:05:06,561 --> 00:05:08,959
Window closes
15 hours and seven minutes.

97
00:05:09,361 --> 00:05:11,811
And that's cutting it really damn close.

98
00:05:15,641 --> 00:05:18,791
Set the clock to 15 hours
and 7 minutes and start it.

99
00:05:20,241 --> 00:05:22,801
We'll be waiting here
till the clock runs out.

100
00:05:28,001 --> 00:05:30,801

105
00:06:12,881 --> 00:06:15,561
So I guess just pack up
everything that's here.

106
00:06:15,681 --> 00:06:18,774
Pack up all of these drafts.
I will have plenty of time on my hands

107
00:06:18,894 --> 00:06:21,401
over the next couple of days,
so pack it up.

108
00:06:23,118 --> 00:06:24,411
At least the worst is over.

109
00:06:24,531 --> 00:06:26,961
2 more Doloxan treatments
and you will be over the hump.

110
00:06:27,081 --> 00:06:28,921
And I'm gonna need you to...

111
00:06:29,241 --> 00:06:31,322
Really keep an eye on things until then.

112
00:06:31,442 --> 00:06:32,482
Don't worry.

113
00:06:32,722 --> 00:06:36,162
I'll make sure our friend from Picon
sees the error of his ways.

114
00:06:36,282 --> 00:06:38,242
I'm not just talking
about the Quorum, Tory.

115
00:06:38,362 --> 00:06:40,882
There was a time a few months ago
when you seemed overwhelmed

116
00:06:41,002 --> 00:06:43,762
by the stresses and the pressures
of this job.

117
00:06:44,482 --> 00:06:46,562
But lately you've really stepped up.

118
00:06:46,682 --> 00:06:49,002
And I'm gonna be demanding
even more of that from you

119
00:06:49,122 --> 00:06:51,172
in the days to come, because...

120
00:06:52,242 --> 00:06:55,322
I'm not quite sure
of what I'm doing right.

121
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:57,632
I'm sort of...

122
00:06:59,602 --> 00:07:02,362
I'm just gonna need you
to keep a keen eye

123
00:07:02,671 --> 00:07:05,679
on every single thing
that comes across this desk.

124
00:07:05,841 --> 00:07:07,922
I appreciate your confidence,
Madame President.

125
00:07:08,042 --> 00:07:09,200
Thank you. Let's go.

126
00:07:22,322 --> 00:07:24,442
Just remember, if this is a trap,

127
00:07:24,562 --> 00:07:25,682
you die first.

128
00:07:32,082 --> 00:07:33,632
Preflight is complete.

129
00:07:34,441 --> 00:07:35,562
I need to know.

130
00:07:35,682 --> 00:07:37,800
Do I need to watch my back
with you on this?

131
00:07:38,162 --> 00:07:39,482
No, I said I'd go.

132
00:07:39,602 --> 00:07:40,882
You have my word.

133
00:07:44,762 --> 00:07:46,712
Be like a homecoming for you.

134
00:07:46,962 --> 00:07:49,712
The other Eights talk
about you all the time.

135
00:07:49,842 --> 00:07:51,892
Keep him the frak away from me.

136
00:07:54,721 --> 00:07:56,962
Barolay, I didn't ask for volunteers.

137
00:07:57,082 --> 00:07:59,242
Yeah, you did, back on Galactica.

138
00:07:59,561 --> 00:08:02,962
I don't give a frak what they think.
You've been kicking ass since day one.

139
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:06,432
You say you can find Earth.
I wanna be there when you do.

140
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,032
You have 14 hours and 40 minutes.

141
00:08:28,922 --> 00:08:30,562
- Godspeed.
- Copy that.

142
00:08:31,402 --> 00:08:32,602
Can you feel it?

143
00:08:34,162 --> 00:08:35,482
The anticipation.

144
00:08:39,681 --> 00:08:41,762
God's plan is about to be revealed.

145
00:08:41,882 --> 00:08:43,842
You better hope so for your sake.

146
00:08:43,962 --> 00:08:46,522
Three, two, one, jump.

147
00:08:50,281 --> 00:08:52,482
Multiple contacts, all quadrants.

148
00:09:00,162 --> 00:09:02,612
Looks like we found what's left of them.

149
00:09:16,061 --> 00:09:17,541
How you doing, Felix?

150
00:09:18,581 --> 00:09:19,661
Never better.

151
00:09:21,821 --> 00:09:24,571
Those frakkers
won't give me any more morpha.

152
00:09:24,901 --> 00:09:26,701
Afraid I'll OD or something.

153
00:09:27,861 --> 00:09:29,061
Yeah, I know.

154
00:09:34,061 --> 00:09:36,011
Will you promise me something?

155
00:09:37,221 --> 00:09:38,221
Anything.

156
00:09:40,461 --> 00:09:42,461
Don't let Cottle take my leg.

157
00:09:43,741 --> 00:09:47,101
- You're gonna be all right.
- Don't frak with me.

158
00:09:47,581 --> 00:09:48,301
Karl.

159
00:09:51,421 --> 00:09:53,771
I know every minute that we stay here

160
00:09:55,381 --> 00:09:58,231
means it's more likely
that he's gonna have to.

161
00:10:00,261 --> 00:10:01,181
Please.

162
00:10:01,581 --> 00:10:02,879
Okay, promise me.

163
00:10:03,421 --> 00:10:04,181
Felix,

164
00:10:05,741 --> 00:10:09,191
you know damn well
I won't leave until the clock runs out.

165
00:10:17,281 --> 00:10:19,141
All right, where's the baseship?

166
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,701
Don't know. If it's still in one piece,
dradis is too cluttered to see it.

167
00:10:22,821 --> 00:10:26,771
Watch yourselves. We've got ordinance
popping off all over the place.

168
00:10:34,661 --> 00:10:37,411
Looks like he wasn't lying
about a civil war.

169
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:39,591
This is it.

170
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:43,291
This is the place.

171
00:10:45,661 --> 00:10:46,799
I can hear it.

172
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:51,131
The unstruck music
vibrates in all of us.

173
00:10:51,861 --> 00:10:53,111
Few can hear it.

174
00:10:53,781 --> 00:10:55,261
Kara's one of the few.

175
00:10:58,781 --> 00:11:00,000
Got a course for us?

176
00:11:02,861 --> 00:11:04,040
Give me the ship.

177
00:11:15,381 --> 00:11:18,231
Starbuck,
you have any idea where you're going?

178
00:11:29,741 --> 00:11:30,691
The comet.

179
00:11:31,061 --> 00:11:31,811
The...

180
00:11:33,341 --> 00:11:34,621
It's the ship.

181
00:11:49,701 --> 00:11:51,751
This is what I was meant to see.

182
00:11:59,581 --> 00:12:01,221
Incoming, right, two high!

183
00:12:19,903 --> 00:12:20,983
She's back.

184
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:24,093
Oh, frak.

185
00:12:26,103 --> 00:12:28,903
Kara.
No, no. Take it easy, Kara.

186
00:12:29,463 --> 00:12:31,743
Everybody made it okay.
You'll be fine.

187
00:12:31,863 --> 00:12:33,313
No, don't touch it.

188
00:12:34,263 --> 00:12:37,213
We need to get her out of here.
Get her some air.

189
00:12:53,103 --> 00:12:54,853
Get the frak away from me!

190
00:12:56,062 --> 00:12:57,679
They call you Athena now.

191
00:12:57,841 --> 00:13:00,991
You even wear
their uniform like you're one of them.

192
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,533
You were the first to say no.

193
00:13:04,022 --> 00:13:05,999
- No to what?
- The entire plan.

194
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:08,611
You joined the humans.
You had a child.

195
00:13:08,743 --> 00:13:12,493
You showed us that we don't have
to be slaves to our programming.

196
00:13:13,601 --> 00:13:16,559
We wanted the same thing,
but it turned out to be a disaster.

197
00:13:16,743 --> 00:13:19,640
The Sixes have made one
mistake after another.

198
00:13:21,663 --> 00:13:25,313
They have to be stopped
before they get the rest of us killed.

199
00:13:26,783 --> 00:13:27,543
Ask.

200
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:29,720
You could help us.

201
00:13:30,742 --> 00:13:33,519
You want me to lead
a mutiny against the Sixes.

202
00:13:33,681 --> 00:13:35,031
It's the only way.

203
00:13:35,463 --> 00:13:37,513
- You guys make me sick.
- Why?

204
00:13:37,743 --> 00:13:40,343
Because you pick your side
and you stick.

205
00:13:40,463 --> 00:13:42,263
You don't cut and run
when things get ugly.

206
00:13:42,383 --> 00:13:45,473
Otherwise you'll never have anything.
No love, no family.

207
00:13:46,233 --> 00:13:47,839
No life to call your own.

208
00:13:48,103 --> 00:13:51,753
Now you guys can either help me
or get the hell out of my way.

209
00:13:57,263 --> 00:13:59,513
<i>...'cause he will take your hand...</i>

210
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,573
<i>... guide you to the other side...</i>

211
00:14:05,702 --> 00:14:07,543
When you're feeling a little better.

212
00:14:07,663 --> 00:14:09,263
Can't you read a chart?

213
00:14:09,383 --> 00:14:11,133
I'm not gonna feel better.

214
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,560
So take your needles
and your thermometers and your catheters

215
00:14:13,943 --> 00:14:16,593
and stick 'em
where the sun doesn't shine.

216
00:14:21,423 --> 00:14:23,273
<i>The undiscovered country...</i>

217
00:14:26,423 --> 00:14:27,223
Hello.

218
00:14:28,343 --> 00:14:29,303
Oh, great.

219
00:14:29,651 --> 00:14:30,959
Now the President.

220
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:33,000
She stuck me three times today.

221
00:14:34,463 --> 00:14:37,063
Be thankful
she hasn't put a catheter in you.

222
00:14:38,982 --> 00:14:41,303
<i>Where we will bask
in the radiance of God's love.</i>

223
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:42,463
All this...

224
00:14:43,263 --> 00:14:44,213
just to...

225
00:14:45,063 --> 00:14:47,063
keep me alive for a few more days.

226
00:14:48,703 --> 00:14:50,039
It's so pointless.

227
00:14:50,463 --> 00:14:52,263
No, it's not pointless.

228
00:14:54,342 --> 00:14:57,143
And I'm sure it isn't helping
listening to Gaius Baltar...

229
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:58,663
No, no, no, don't touch that!

230
00:14:58,783 --> 00:15:00,423
Who the frak do you think you are?

231
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,199
<i>Accept him into your hearts...</i>

232
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:03,623
Leave me alone!

233
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,213
<i>It is all about love.</i>

234
00:15:08,423 --> 00:15:10,873
<i>It's not about living a righteous life.</i>

235
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:14,063
<i>God doesn't really care
how many good deeds we've done.</i>

236
00:15:14,183 --> 00:15:16,383
<i>This is the mistake that I find</i>

237
00:15:16,503 --> 00:15:18,353
<i>that so many of the pious...</i>

238
00:15:18,521 --> 00:15:20,783
The Hybrid will want to see you,
I know it.

239
00:15:20,903 --> 00:15:22,999
- Let's go then.
- What are you doing?

240
00:15:23,161 --> 00:15:26,023
You want to give her access to
the central nervous system of this ship?

241
00:15:26,143 --> 00:15:28,503
- I thought we had a deal.
- We discussed this.

242
00:15:28,623 --> 00:15:31,599
- Kara's the key to our salvation.
- We agreed on an alliance.

243
00:15:31,761 --> 00:15:33,863
You want an alliance, I see the Hybrid.

244
00:15:33,983 --> 00:15:36,433
Leoben claims it can help me find Earth.

245
00:15:37,021 --> 00:15:38,703
There's no way around it.

246
00:15:38,823 --> 00:15:41,759
We've tried to be patient about
your model's obsession with this woman.

247
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:44,119
Playing house with her
on New Caprica was one thing.

248
00:15:44,281 --> 00:15:46,431
But this puts us all in Jeopardy.

249
00:15:47,102 --> 00:15:50,343
We have their Raptor and their jump
drive. We don't need them.

250
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,783
- Frakkin' toaster...
- Barolay, don't.

251
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,719
You don't have time to figure out
our jump systems without our help.

252
00:15:55,983 --> 00:15:57,759
Not before the other Cylons get back.

253
00:15:57,921 --> 00:16:00,171
And if we do figure it out in time,

254
00:16:00,982 --> 00:16:04,543
do we just keep running? How long before
we run out of fuel, food, ammunition?

255
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:06,783
How long before
Cavil's forces hunt us down?

256
00:16:06,903 --> 00:16:08,023
Like it or not,

257
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,783
we have to work with the Colonials.
That means Kara sees the Hybrid.

258
00:16:12,703 --> 00:16:14,863
Or you can kiss your asses good-bye.

259
00:16:17,503 --> 00:16:19,453
Looks as if we have no choice.

260
00:16:21,663 --> 00:16:23,223
But first, we do this.

261
00:16:33,863 --> 00:16:35,623
Okay, we can do this.

262
00:16:36,222 --> 00:16:38,800
We can give their ship jump
capability again by slaving its drives

263
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,360
- to our Raptor's spin sync generator.
- So just do it.

264
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,527
Their Hybrid was damaged in the attack,
so we're gonna have to pull her offline

265
00:16:45,647 --> 00:16:47,120
and execute jumps from the Raptor.

266
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,573
Pull the Hybrid offline?
Absolutely not.

267
00:16:49,693 --> 00:16:51,743
It's never been done
on an operational ship.

268
00:16:51,863 --> 00:16:53,920
It would be like blinding her.
It might kill her.

269
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:58,173
If we don't do this before the other
Cylons come back, we're all dead anyway.

270
00:17:03,663 --> 00:17:04,880
Make it happen, Lt.

271
00:17:07,383 --> 00:17:08,233
Barolay,

272
00:17:08,353 --> 00:17:11,343
yank the connectors from the bus
and strip the cables out of them.

273
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:13,113
You got it, Lieutenant.

274
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:16,023
And, Six, I'm gonna need
some data cabling right away.

275
00:17:16,143 --> 00:17:19,793
Single mode, 1310, otherwise
you'll blow our system to shreds.

276
00:17:21,302 --> 00:17:22,943
We started the interface.

277
00:17:23,063 --> 00:17:24,713
Take me to this Hybrid.

278
00:17:24,881 --> 00:17:26,431
Anders, you're on me.

279
00:17:26,841 --> 00:17:28,423
Might be better if I stay here.

280
00:17:28,543 --> 00:17:31,593
I know more about
the Raptor's system than they do.

281
00:17:49,343 --> 00:17:52,293
- What the hell are you looking at?
- I know you.

282
00:17:52,463 --> 00:17:55,813
You were on New Caprica.
You were part of the resistance.

283
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:57,733
You killed me.

284
00:17:58,373 --> 00:18:02,623
Watched me drown, kicking and thrashing
like I was some kind of an insect.

285
00:18:02,743 --> 00:18:04,793
Be happy to put you down again.

286
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,383
I'm okay.

287
00:18:20,783 --> 00:18:21,633
Barolay?

288
00:18:23,183 --> 00:18:23,933
Jean.

289
00:18:25,303 --> 00:18:26,063
Jean!

290
00:18:35,383 --> 00:18:36,519
You killed her.

291
00:18:39,103 --> 00:18:40,520
You frakkin' killed her!

292
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,263
You want to know what
it feels like to die? You're nothing!

293
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,903
You're a frakkin' machine!
Sam, put the gun down now!

294
00:18:51,023 --> 00:18:53,080
- Sam, stop!
- What do you want me to do, Kara?

295
00:18:53,463 --> 00:18:56,543
You want me to forget about Barolay?
You want me to forget about New Caprica?

296
00:18:56,663 --> 00:18:58,663
No frakkin' way!
She just killed Barolay!

297
00:18:58,783 --> 00:19:00,623
Sam! Put the gun down.

298
00:19:01,863 --> 00:19:03,879
- Put it down.
- Look into it.

299
00:19:09,881 --> 00:19:10,623
Sam.

300
00:19:10,743 --> 00:19:11,503
Sam,

301
00:19:12,703 --> 00:19:15,423
you have no idea what's at stake here.

302
00:19:15,823 --> 00:19:16,983
Look at me.

303
00:19:17,503 --> 00:19:18,553
Put it down.

304
00:19:18,982 --> 00:19:22,263
They killed one of us
and you're just ready to let it slide?

305
00:19:22,383 --> 00:19:23,383
She's right.

306
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,160
You can't let this go, Kara.

307
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,183
If you don't want to do this, I will.

308
00:19:29,561 --> 00:19:31,040
Put the gun down, soldier.

309
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,983
I need to see the Hybrid.

310
00:19:36,743 --> 00:19:37,759
Why, sister?

311
00:19:38,153 --> 00:19:39,759
I just couldn't let it go.

312
00:19:40,023 --> 00:19:42,319
- On New Caprica...
- She was the one?

313
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,383
I never did anything to her.

314
00:19:44,761 --> 00:19:47,383
We were working at the water
treatment plant and she just...

315
00:19:47,503 --> 00:19:49,263
I know. I remember.

316
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:52,039
After you downloaded,
we tried to work through this.

317
00:19:52,201 --> 00:19:54,951
How do you work
through something like that?

318
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:58,543
Never forget her expression
as I tried to scream.

319
00:19:58,863 --> 00:19:59,743
Just...

320
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,583
Just slapped tape over my mouth

321
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:06,480
- and threw me in that septic tank.
- You shut your frakkin' mouth.

322
00:20:06,903 --> 00:20:09,439
I still see her face
when I try and sleep.

323
00:20:10,863 --> 00:20:13,079
We were trying to help those people.

324
00:20:13,263 --> 00:20:14,143
I know.

325
00:20:15,063 --> 00:20:17,913
I know.
I wish there was something I could do.

326
00:20:19,863 --> 00:20:21,423
Then I'm glad it's you.

327
00:20:48,503 --> 00:20:49,583
Gods damn it!

328
00:20:54,463 --> 00:20:55,943
No resurrection ship.

329
00:20:56,063 --> 00:20:57,303
You understand?

330
00:20:57,783 --> 00:20:59,933
She's just as dead as your friend.

331
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,933
Is that enough human justice for you?

332
00:21:06,063 --> 00:21:07,263
Blood for blood?

333
00:21:24,943 --> 00:21:26,183
Madam President.

334
00:21:28,383 --> 00:21:30,463
I wanted to apologize for before.

335
00:21:31,783 --> 00:21:33,633
I have good moments and bad.

336
00:21:34,103 --> 00:21:35,543
And that was which?

337
00:21:38,103 --> 00:21:40,503
Come in here. I have something for you.

338
00:21:40,881 --> 00:21:42,759
- For me?
- Yes, yes, come in.

339
00:21:42,921 --> 00:21:43,771
Come in.

340
00:21:45,382 --> 00:21:48,679
All right. Would you get it?
It's in the first drawer. Right here.

341
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:50,663
That's it, yes.

342
00:21:51,023 --> 00:21:52,263
This is for me?

343
00:21:52,383 --> 00:21:54,143
I hope it's not too gaudy.

344
00:21:56,063 --> 00:21:57,413
This is beautiful.

345
00:21:57,902 --> 00:21:59,623
Thank you. That's beautiful.

346
00:21:59,743 --> 00:22:02,583
A woman on Aurora makes 'em.
Leslie Starus.

347
00:22:02,703 --> 00:22:04,423
She makes all kinds

348
00:22:04,942 --> 00:22:06,543
if you want to check it out.

349
00:22:06,663 --> 00:22:08,183
Now, I think this one

350
00:22:08,503 --> 00:22:09,823
will be just fine.

351
00:22:10,983 --> 00:22:12,903
What color are you hoping for?

352
00:22:13,823 --> 00:22:15,383
When it grows back in?

353
00:22:16,623 --> 00:22:17,473
Well...

354
00:22:18,783 --> 00:22:20,783
I was thinking maybe blue.

355
00:22:21,053 --> 00:22:22,303
Nice royal blue.

356
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,623
Change of pace.

357
00:22:29,143 --> 00:22:30,623
My hair used to be...

358
00:22:32,223 --> 00:22:33,873
Now look at it. Feel it,

359
00:22:34,463 --> 00:22:35,313
feel it.

360
00:22:42,263 --> 00:22:43,943
It's gonna get a lot worse.

361
00:22:45,623 --> 00:22:47,103
Be prepared for that.

362
00:22:48,473 --> 00:22:50,423
<i>Because he will take our hands</i>

363
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,863
<i>and guide us
to the other side of the river.</i>

364
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,821
All these things at once and many more.

365
00:22:56,941 --> 00:22:58,701
Not because it wishes harm,

366
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,341
but because it likes
violent vibrations to change constantly.

367
00:23:02,461 --> 00:23:05,061
Then shall
the maidens rejoice at the dance.

368
00:23:05,181 --> 00:23:07,701
Structural integrity
of node seven restored.

369
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:09,541
Repressurizing.

370
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:13,039
The children of the one reborn
shall find their own country.

371
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,901
The intruders swarmed like flame.

372
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,301
Like the whirlwind.

373
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,581
Hopes soaring to slaughter
all their best against our hulls.

374
00:23:19,701 --> 00:23:21,741
I'm here. You wanted me here, so...

375
00:23:21,861 --> 00:23:24,461
Replace internal control accumulators
4 through 19.

376
00:23:24,581 --> 00:23:26,879
They'll start going ripe on us
pretty soon.

377
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:30,981
Compartmentalize integrity conflicts
with the obligation to provide access.

378
00:23:31,261 --> 00:23:33,341
FTL sync fault uncorrected.

379
00:23:34,061 --> 00:23:36,061
No ceremonies are necessary.

380
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,621
For what it's worth,
I voted for you in the last election.

381
00:23:39,901 --> 00:23:43,141
And I don't like
how Baltar keeps ragging on you.

382
00:23:43,261 --> 00:23:46,999
- But that is not why I listen to him.
- Why do you listen to him?

383
00:23:47,261 --> 00:23:51,381
I had an experience that made me
rethink all my preconceptions.

384
00:23:52,261 --> 00:23:53,879
What kind of experience?

385
00:23:54,381 --> 00:23:57,101
It happened the night after Cottle
told me that

386
00:23:57,221 --> 00:24:01,141
my cancer had spread to my liver
and I'd never be leaving this place.

387
00:24:01,741 --> 00:24:03,941
I was on a ferry, crossing a river,

388
00:24:04,061 --> 00:24:07,181
and as we were approaching
the other side,

389
00:24:07,461 --> 00:24:10,701
I saw all these people
standing on the bank.

390
00:24:11,581 --> 00:24:13,131
And we got closer, and

391
00:24:13,541 --> 00:24:15,381
I recognized them.

392
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:17,381
My parents.

393
00:24:17,941 --> 00:24:20,581
My sister Kathy, who died when I was 12.

394
00:24:20,701 --> 00:24:23,021
My husband, my girls.

395
00:24:24,861 --> 00:24:26,861
I was scared

396
00:24:27,221 --> 00:24:30,071
for a moment.
You know, how is this happening?

397
00:24:32,821 --> 00:24:34,861
But then I felt it.

398
00:24:34,981 --> 00:24:36,021
This...

399
00:24:37,741 --> 00:24:38,941
presence...

400
00:24:39,501 --> 00:24:41,341
hovering all around me.

401
00:24:41,861 --> 00:24:43,261
Warm,

402
00:24:43,781 --> 00:24:45,221
loving, and...

403
00:24:45,861 --> 00:24:47,301
It said...

404
00:24:48,501 --> 00:24:50,421
"Don't be scared, Emily.

405
00:24:51,021 --> 00:24:52,171
"I'm with you.

406
00:24:53,381 --> 00:24:56,581
"Hold my hand
and we'll cross over together."

407
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,861
But a lot of people in our predicament
have dreams like that, Emily.

408
00:25:00,981 --> 00:25:01,941
No.

409
00:25:02,381 --> 00:25:03,541
I was there.

410
00:25:05,501 --> 00:25:06,821
I felt...

411
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,221
The cool breeze coming from the water.
The spray from the bow.

412
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:16,261
Maybe he's stumbled onto something.
You know,

413
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:18,821
he talks about the river that separates

414
00:25:18,941 --> 00:25:21,101
our world from the next.

415
00:25:21,621 --> 00:25:25,421
That there's more to this existence
than we can see with our naked eye.

416
00:25:26,701 --> 00:25:29,861
There's a power
that we can't begin to understand.

417
00:25:36,871 --> 00:25:39,621
Then shall the maidens
rejoice at the dance.

418
00:25:39,741 --> 00:25:42,501
Structural integrity of node seven
restored.

419
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:44,301
Repressurizing.

420
00:25:44,421 --> 00:25:47,701
The children of the one reborn
shall find their own country.

421
00:25:48,221 --> 00:25:49,421
End of line.

422
00:25:49,661 --> 00:25:50,661
Reset.

423
00:25:51,101 --> 00:25:53,451
Track mode monitor malfunction traced.

424
00:25:53,901 --> 00:25:55,341
Recharge compressors.

425
00:25:55,461 --> 00:25:57,661
Increase the output to 50%.

426
00:25:57,851 --> 00:26:00,501
Assume the relaxation length
of photons...

427
00:26:00,621 --> 00:26:03,981
Transfers contact is inevitable,
leading to information bleed.

428
00:26:04,421 --> 00:26:06,781
FTL sync fault stands uncorrected.

429
00:26:06,901 --> 00:26:09,221
- No ceremonies are necessary...
- I don't understand.

430
00:26:09,341 --> 00:26:12,360
Centrifugal forces reacts
to the rotating frame of reference.

431
00:26:12,741 --> 00:26:15,221
The obstinate toy soldier
becomes pliant.

432
00:26:15,421 --> 00:26:18,571
- The city devours the land...
- You can't hurry her.

433
00:26:19,021 --> 00:26:21,101
You have to absorb her words.

434
00:26:21,461 --> 00:26:23,981
Allow them to caress
your associative mind.

435
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,981
Don't expect the fate of two great races
to be delivered easily.

436
00:26:28,101 --> 00:26:31,760
Assume the relaxation length of photons
in the sample atmosphere is constant.

437
00:26:32,181 --> 00:26:33,861
The intruders swarmed like flame.

438
00:26:33,981 --> 00:26:35,040
Like the whirlwind.

439
00:26:35,421 --> 00:26:38,971
Hopes soaring to slaughter
all their best against our hulls.

440
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,351
All these things at once and many more.

441
00:27:07,471 --> 00:27:08,999
Not because it wishes harm,

442
00:27:09,161 --> 00:27:12,811
but because it likes violent vibrations
to change constantly...

443
00:27:12,981 --> 00:27:14,821
Hey, we're rigged and ready.

444
00:27:14,941 --> 00:27:17,741
Time to pull her offline and get out
of here before we miss our rendezvous.

445
00:27:17,861 --> 00:27:19,701
- Reset.
- Any luck, Captain?

446
00:27:20,141 --> 00:27:21,661
Not a frakkin' thing.

447
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:24,621
But you are a spark of God's fire.

448
00:27:24,741 --> 00:27:26,261
Core update complete.

449
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,239
Frak it! Unplug the damn thing.
Let's get the frak out of here.

450
00:27:29,401 --> 00:27:31,541
Threat detection matrix enabled.

451
00:27:31,851 --> 00:27:33,701
Dendritic response bypassed.

452
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,639
The received dose
is altered by the delayed gamma burst.

453
00:27:36,801 --> 00:27:37,821
Going active.

454
00:27:37,941 --> 00:27:41,240
Execute. The children of the one reborn
shall find their own country.

455
00:27:42,421 --> 00:27:43,480
End of line.

456
00:27:49,781 --> 00:27:50,781
Stop!

457
00:27:51,701 --> 00:27:52,559
Athena!

458
00:27:57,141 --> 00:27:58,791
What the hell happened?

459
00:28:16,541 --> 00:28:18,291
What do you want from me?

460
00:28:19,021 --> 00:28:19,871
Please,

461
00:28:20,321 --> 00:28:21,501
I need you.

462
00:28:30,781 --> 00:28:32,501
Thus will it come to pass.

463
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:36,639
The dying leader
will know the truth of the opera house.

464
00:28:36,801 --> 00:28:39,141
The missing Three will give you the Five

465
00:28:39,261 --> 00:28:41,581
who have come from the home of the 13th.

466
00:28:42,081 --> 00:28:44,679
You are the harbinger of death,
Kara Thrace.

467
00:28:44,981 --> 00:28:47,231
You will lead them all to their end.

468
00:28:49,421 --> 00:28:50,941
End of line.

469
00:29:07,101 --> 00:29:08,821
But this god

470
00:29:08,941 --> 00:29:12,061
that Baltar refers to,
it is the Cylon god.

471
00:29:12,711 --> 00:29:14,461
You know that, don't you?

472
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:16,741
If he's the one and true God,

473
00:29:17,061 --> 00:29:19,061
he belongs to all of us.

474
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,821
Otherwise,
he's not much of a god, is he?

475
00:29:22,321 --> 00:29:24,861
Exactly, he isn't much of a god.
He's a fantasy.

476
00:29:24,981 --> 00:29:26,501
Oh, Laura.

477
00:29:26,741 --> 00:29:28,639
And the Lords of Kobol are real.

478
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,661
Reigning from a metaphysical mountaintop
in those silly outfits.

479
00:29:34,581 --> 00:29:36,840
Zeus handing out fates

480
00:29:37,261 --> 00:29:40,279
out of an urn like...
like they were lottery tickets.

481
00:29:40,441 --> 00:29:43,101
"You're gonna work on a tylium ship.
You're gonna be an admiral.

482
00:29:43,221 --> 00:29:45,021
"Your family's gonna be

483
00:29:45,141 --> 00:29:47,541
"evaporated
in an attack on the Colonies,

484
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:51,861
"but you'll survive for three more years
in a moldy compartment on a freighter

485
00:29:52,101 --> 00:29:55,141
"till your body
starts to eat itself up alive."

486
00:29:56,781 --> 00:29:58,941
Those are the gods that you worship?

487
00:29:59,261 --> 00:30:01,701
Capricious, vindictive.

488
00:30:02,701 --> 00:30:05,451
But they're not meant
to be taken literally.

489
00:30:06,181 --> 00:30:07,919
They're metaphors, Emily.

490
00:30:08,081 --> 00:30:09,901
I don't need metaphors.

491
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:12,381
I need answers.

492
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:16,901
You're like my mother. She wasn't
satisfied with metaphors either.

493
00:30:17,021 --> 00:30:18,941
She was convinced that Aphrodite herself

494
00:30:19,061 --> 00:30:21,560
was gonna swoop her away when she died,
and she believed it.

495
00:30:21,901 --> 00:30:24,261
Even after the Doloxan

496
00:30:24,701 --> 00:30:27,501
and the radiation
failed to stop her cancer.

497
00:30:27,781 --> 00:30:30,101
She was a teacher. She was a...

498
00:30:30,901 --> 00:30:33,221
She was something to behold in...

499
00:30:34,461 --> 00:30:36,861
At the head of a classroom.

500
00:30:36,981 --> 00:30:38,431
And her students...

501
00:30:40,841 --> 00:30:42,901
Her students loved her. They...

502
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:47,691
they'd walk through fire for her.
And then you see this woman who...

503
00:30:49,341 --> 00:30:50,421
seemed so...

504
00:30:53,901 --> 00:30:55,701
eternal, she...

505
00:30:57,821 --> 00:30:58,941
withered away,

506
00:30:59,461 --> 00:31:00,821
and I find myself

507
00:31:01,101 --> 00:31:04,240
having to change her diaper
because she couldn't even...

508
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:11,141
And at the moment she died,
there was no gleaming fields of Elysium

509
00:31:11,261 --> 00:31:13,911
stretched out before her.
There was this...

510
00:31:14,141 --> 00:31:15,101
dark...

511
00:31:16,981 --> 00:31:18,581
black abyss.

512
00:31:23,301 --> 00:31:25,101
And she was just terrified.

513
00:31:26,621 --> 00:31:28,421
She was so scared.

514
00:31:30,141 --> 00:31:31,501
I'm sorry.

515
00:31:34,781 --> 00:31:35,541
Laura.

516
00:31:40,981 --> 00:31:41,781
Laura.

517
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:44,981
You were terrified.

518
00:31:45,701 --> 00:31:48,021
You saw only darkness.

519
00:31:48,661 --> 00:31:50,781
You can't possibly

520
00:31:50,901 --> 00:31:53,501
know what your mother experienced.

521
00:31:54,901 --> 00:31:57,021
You're... you're still searching.

522
00:31:57,261 --> 00:31:58,211
You're...

523
00:32:00,581 --> 00:32:02,341
Doc Cottle! Doc!

524
00:32:03,461 --> 00:32:06,611
- Do something!
- Nurse, get me some morpha quickly.

525
00:32:09,421 --> 00:32:10,501
It's okay.

526
00:32:12,861 --> 00:32:14,111
It's all right.

527
00:32:23,901 --> 00:32:25,861
All we can do for her now is...

528
00:32:26,421 --> 00:32:28,501
try to make her comfortable.

529
00:32:30,221 --> 00:32:32,581
- That's all?
- I'm sorry, that's it.

530
00:32:34,541 --> 00:32:35,501
All right.

531
00:32:55,464 --> 00:32:57,625
It's as if
she doesn't even see us anymore.

532
00:32:57,745 --> 00:32:59,225
She's looking past us.

533
00:33:00,065 --> 00:33:02,105
I've seen that look many times,

534
00:33:02,225 --> 00:33:04,375
but never in the eyes of a Cylon.

535
00:33:04,945 --> 00:33:06,145
Athena.

536
00:33:07,305 --> 00:33:08,555
You were right.

537
00:33:12,665 --> 00:33:13,945
Forgive me.

538
00:33:43,705 --> 00:33:44,655
It's okay.

539
00:33:45,905 --> 00:33:47,055
I'm with you.

540
00:34:16,984 --> 00:34:18,400
She will lead us to the end.

541
00:34:18,785 --> 00:34:21,305
We will now know the truth
of the opera house.

542
00:34:21,425 --> 00:34:22,865
The home of the 13th.

543
00:34:23,385 --> 00:34:24,145
What?

544
00:34:25,024 --> 00:34:28,145
The hybrid said, "the missing Three
will give you the Five

545
00:34:28,265 --> 00:34:30,639
"who have come
from the home of the 13th."

546
00:34:31,225 --> 00:34:33,505
The home of the 13th tribe of humans...

547
00:34:34,905 --> 00:34:36,225
And the Five...

548
00:34:37,305 --> 00:34:39,119
is your Final Five Cylon models.

549
00:34:40,264 --> 00:34:42,585
And if they've come
from the home of the 13th tribe,

550
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:44,425
they must know the way back.

551
00:34:44,545 --> 00:34:46,495
They know how to get to Earth.

552
00:34:48,081 --> 00:34:49,985
And the missing Three
is the model you boxed

553
00:34:50,105 --> 00:34:53,055
- for looking at the faces of the Five.
- D'Anna.

554
00:34:54,825 --> 00:34:56,305
She can recognize 'em.

555
00:34:58,825 --> 00:34:59,745
Let's go.

556
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,759
Demetrius is waiting for us.

557
00:35:34,385 --> 00:35:35,425
We're here.

558
00:36:13,825 --> 00:36:14,785
Mother.

559
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:21,479
You're okay.

560
00:36:29,225 --> 00:36:30,705
I'm not ready.

561
00:36:43,945 --> 00:36:47,425
<i>... You no longer
need to fear the unknown.</i>

562
00:36:50,505 --> 00:36:52,425
<i>Because he will take your hand</i>

563
00:36:54,505 --> 00:36:57,185
<i>and guide you
to the other side of the river.</i>

564
00:36:58,985 --> 00:37:01,025
<i>What river am I talking about?</i>

565
00:37:02,745 --> 00:37:06,265
<i>I'm talking about the river
that separates this world from the next.</i>

566
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:09,545
<i>There is more to reality</i>

567
00:37:09,665 --> 00:37:12,105
<i>than the things that we can touch,</i>

568
00:37:12,825 --> 00:37:13,905
<i>taste,</i>

569
00:37:14,345 --> 00:37:16,705
<i>or even see with our naked eyes.</i>

570
00:37:17,505 --> 00:37:19,545
<i>There is another realm.</i>

571
00:37:25,264 --> 00:37:26,999
All hands to jump stations.

572
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,785
Prepare to jump the ship.

573
00:37:28,905 --> 00:37:33,065
<i>All hands to jump stations.
Prepare to jump the ship.</i>

574
00:37:56,465 --> 00:37:57,815
Come on, come on.

575
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:03,945
Sublight.

576
00:38:04,625 --> 00:38:05,345
Go.

577
00:38:06,665 --> 00:38:07,785
- Helm.
- Go.

578
00:38:07,905 --> 00:38:09,200
- Nav.
- Go.

579
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,535
- Tactical.
- Go.

580
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:12,865
Jump solution checks. Nav is go.

581
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:18,305
FTL.

582
00:38:18,945 --> 00:38:21,185
Drive's spun up 100% and stable, go.

583
00:38:35,025 --> 00:38:36,475
The board is green.

584
00:38:41,065 --> 00:38:42,185
She's gone.

585
00:38:42,865 --> 00:38:44,320
Or they'd be back by now.

586
00:38:46,265 --> 00:38:47,915
Execute jump in five...

587
00:38:48,585 --> 00:38:50,305
Four... Three...

588
00:38:54,935 --> 00:38:56,185
Dradis contact!

589
00:38:56,305 --> 00:38:58,025
Cylon baseship.
It's right on top of us.

590
00:38:58,145 --> 00:39:00,025
Hold the count! Hold the count!

591
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,665
Baseship is squawking colonial ID.

592
00:39:02,785 --> 00:39:05,079
I've got a comm signal,
but it's really weak.

593
00:39:05,241 --> 00:39:06,159
Speakers!

594
00:39:08,465 --> 00:39:10,865
<i>Demetrius, Athena.
Demetrius, Athena.</i>

595
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,145
Gods, it's good to hear your voice.

596
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,675
Copy that, Helo.

597
00:39:18,185 --> 00:39:19,599
The baseship is ours.

598
00:39:20,225 --> 00:39:21,480
Mission accomplished.

599
00:39:22,305 --> 00:39:23,785
Then let's go home.

600
00:39:35,705 --> 00:39:37,345
I need to talk to you.

601
00:39:37,585 --> 00:39:39,785
- Certainly. Come in.
- Thank you.

602
00:39:41,065 --> 00:39:43,315
- Can I get you some water?
- Yes.

603
00:39:44,544 --> 00:39:48,225
You really believe that there's
something in this horse manure that

604
00:39:48,345 --> 00:39:49,825
Baltar's peddling?

605
00:39:50,865 --> 00:39:52,185
I don't know.

606
00:39:53,105 --> 00:39:57,055
Something is happening here,
and I don't really understand it, Bill.

607
00:39:58,065 --> 00:40:00,305
You both had the same dream,

608
00:40:00,785 --> 00:40:01,705
means...

609
00:40:05,825 --> 00:40:06,625
What?

610
00:40:07,385 --> 00:40:09,385
Talk to me. What's going on?

611
00:40:14,025 --> 00:40:16,105
Kara comes back from the dead.

612
00:40:17,425 --> 00:40:19,905
I let her go off chasing her vision

613
00:40:20,025 --> 00:40:20,985
of Earth.

614
00:40:22,105 --> 00:40:23,705
Well, she's overdue.

615
00:40:25,305 --> 00:40:26,005
Lee

616
00:40:26,505 --> 00:40:28,225
turns in his wings.

617
00:40:29,305 --> 00:40:31,545
And Helo, Athena, Gaeta.

618
00:40:31,825 --> 00:40:33,905
Will I ever see those kids again?

619
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:41,105
Bill.

620
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:43,265
Look at me.

621
00:40:44,265 --> 00:40:45,625
I'm right here.

622
00:40:47,425 --> 00:40:48,585
Right here.

623
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,515
We're going to find it.

624
00:40:53,585 --> 00:40:54,465
Earth?

625
00:40:55,345 --> 00:40:56,345
Together.

626
00:40:57,345 --> 00:40:59,705
I used to think
it was such a pipe dream.

627
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:03,119
I used to use it
as a carrot for the fleet.

628
00:41:04,505 --> 00:41:06,065
What made you change?

629
00:41:07,945 --> 00:41:08,665
You.

630
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:12,305
You made me believe.

631
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,345
- =( Team Lords of Kobol )= -
