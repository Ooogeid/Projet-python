00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,770
TWELVE CYLON MODELS

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:08,200
SEVEN ARE KNOWN

3
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,340
FOUR LIVE IN SECRET

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,870
ONE WILL BE REVEALED

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,020
previously,on battlestar galactica.

6
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,160
you'll be safe here,gaius.

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,490
Please,god,don't let this child die.

8
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:30,530
God answered your prayers,

9
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,730
- you have to see.
- What?

10
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:32,610
look at him.

11
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:33,760
and no trace of a fever.

12
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,260
it's a miracle.

13
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:36,770
Tory,tory,tory.

14
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,950
Fancy finding you in the cafeteria.

15
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,370
You have an abundance of feeling.

16
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,640
I suppose I could be a cylon.

17
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,380
Cylons can feel.

18
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:46,370
You believe that?

19
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,760
Yeah,I do actually.

20
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,100
I want to explain.

21
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,560
She sought us out.

22
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,770
You know what has to be done here.

23
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:55,390
Now,it would be better for 
her sake if it was you.

24
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,190
Let's say cally does find out.

25
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,130
What do we do then?

26
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:02,820
The last thing we need is for 
your cylon-hating wife

27
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,320
to find out there's a bunch of 
skinjobs running around this ship.

28
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,530
And that her husband is one of them.

29
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,170
Ll stay the frak away from me!

30
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,210
I heard you.

31
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,190
You're cylons.

32
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,340
A bunch of frakking skinjobs.

33
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:33,780
I couldn't keep you safe 
from harm,my love,

34
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,150
but I kept you in my heart.

35
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:43,090
You were the breath in my lungs,
the blood in my veins,

36
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:50,000
the light in my eye,and now that breath is gone.

37
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,810
That blood and the light are gone.

38
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:03,560
I am left,a voice.

39
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:17,170
And the lords of kobol,as many 
and as varied as mortal men,

40
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:27,410
must bend down and lean low to hear 
that voice and hear my lament.

41
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,530
With all our thoughts and love,
calandra henderson tyrol,

42
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,580
we send your spirit into the universe.

43
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,930
So say we all.

44
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,800
so say we all.

45
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,340
I liked that service.

46
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,610
It's not for me,I'll tell you that.

47
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:12,640
I know,but I want you to know what I like.

48
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,550
It was lovely.

49
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,160
Thank you.

50
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:26,390
Why do they have to do these things at dawn?

51
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,480
It's all right.

52
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,440
They do because they have to.

53
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,140
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,280
Let me know if you need anything.

55
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,580
Thank you.

56
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,870
Sorry about your loss.

57
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,430
Sorry,chief.

58
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,680
What the frak was that?

59
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,970
Get us all killed.

60
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,330
Chief.

61
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,130
I'm--I'm so sorry.

62
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,380
What's it up to today?

63
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:21,510
Same as-- sleeping,pacing.

64
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,740
Don't know how it doesn't go nuts.

65
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,340
Probably turns its brain off.

66
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,010
Frakkin' toaster.

67
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,870
Yeah.

68
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,080
Colonel.

69
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,870
Your request to see the child,
hera agathon,has been denied.

70
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:47,160
And you felt the need to come all the way 
down here in person to tell me that again?

71
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,720
You think I want to come down here?

72
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,270
We're done.

73
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,670
I think we're not.

74
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,470
You come every day.

75
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:01,110
but you never ask questions anymore.

76
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,320
Is there something that you want from me?

77
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,750
Is there something that you need?

78
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,400
Stay back.

79
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,550
See you tomorrow,colonel.

80
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,650
door!

81
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,630
What was that at the service this morning?

82
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,990
Why don't you get on the wireless 
and tell the fleet about us?

83
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,800
Are you going to deal with that kid?

84
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,210
Probably needs to be changed.

85
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,480
All right.

86
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,300
You think cally killed herself 
because of you,don't you?

87
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,000
She thought we were having an affair.

88
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,170
But we weren'T.

89
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:06,370
I don't even know what I am anymore.

90
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:09,430
I don't know which of my memories are real.

91
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:14,730
I don't know that I've had one action 
in my life that isn't programmed.

92
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,830
Galen,you're perfect.

93
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,120
You don't need guilt.

94
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,400
We were made to be perfect.

95
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,880
what is that?

96
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,940
More of baltar's crap?

97
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,790
So.

98
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,760
you just live without guilt?

99
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,870
Just shut it down.

100
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,870
No,that wasn't the deal.

101
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,560
Colonel,you said it yourself.

102
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,630
Be the man you want to be till the day you die.

103
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,310
We're still the same people,aren't we?

104
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:49,280
Of course,we are.

105
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,030
You shut up.

106
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,210
That is not the same as human.

107
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,280
Like we're stronger,right?

108
00:06:55,330 --> 00:07:01,930
Chief,what you're feeling is what 
a man feels when this happens.

109
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,540
It's normal,and it's human.

110
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,560
And it's not gonna end anytime soon.

111
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,190
It'll be there every day.

112
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,870
You'll see her every day.

113
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,170
You'll see her.

114
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,990
be a man,chief.

115
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,720
Feel what you gotta feel.

116
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,670
But don't risk us.

117
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,550
Come on,tory.

118
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,740
Just think about it.

119
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,160
Think about what we are.

120
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,700
What we can do.

Dear gods,what.

128
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,170
Gods?

129
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,820
Thought there was only one.

130
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,310
What are you doing?

131
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,890
Pulling one hair from your head at a time.

132
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:06,470
It's intense,isn't it?

133
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:07,170
Yeah.

134
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:13,150
It happens at the same time 
as a pleasurable touch.

135
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:16,240
Frak!

136
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:19,100
- Signals get crossed,don't they?
- Yeah.

137
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,620
It's hard to tell the pleasure from the pain.

138
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,560
Yeah.

139
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,100
Okay,listen,I think that...

140
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,970
you're very strong,aren't you?

141
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,110
You really.

142
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,540
I think I preferred it when you cried.

143
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:43,340
if you assume that god forgives 
you,then it's gone,right?

144
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,920
Erased?

145
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,810
Forgiveness.

146
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,870
you mustatonsecre the sin.

147
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,560
- Make it benign.
- Oh,yeah.

148
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:54,080
- Bad becomes good.
- Oh,yes,it does.

149
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,830
Pain becomes pleasure.

150
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,510
and doesn't that mean,

151
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,070
if you really become one with god,
you can never do wrong?

152
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:08,650
Noll,,um,not really,because that wou.

153
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,330
That would more than imply 
that we're all perfect.

154
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,670
- Perfect?
- Yeah.

155
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:29,410
- Perfect just as we are.
- No,no,no!No!

156
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,290
Go on,go,get out!

00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:38,340
It's not gonna look very good when 
they get beat by a school bus.

185
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,940
Okay,let's ride.

186
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,020
What the frak?

187
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:54,260
Galactica/ racetrack,I have no control 
in my port rear lower rcs thruster.

188
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,400
Skulls,get your ass up here.

189
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,680
galactica/racetrack,coming about.

190
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,080
Clear port landing deck for emergency landing.

191
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:05,410
racetrack/galactica,emergency landing cleared.

192
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:10,370
One,two,three,four.

193
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:13,320
One,two,three.

194
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,090
Coming in hot.

195
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:17,420
too hot!

196
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:30,790
Where's the admiral?

197
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:31,530
Where is he?

198
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,140
And what are you doing,taking notes,
standing here,mr.Officious?

199
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,590
You should be out there,right now,

200
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,350
trying to find the people,whoever they are!

201
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,670
Whatever you say,sir.

202
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,730
You can read the old text,can't you,gaius?

203
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:45,370
sons of ar-is?

204
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,630
Ares.Sons of ares.

205
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,850
they're the people who committed this attack.

206
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,620
Obviously,a fundamentalist splinter group.

207
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:58,540
Although,all they're doing is trying 
to protect the old gods.

208
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,910
old gods die hard.

209
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,420
Even among your people.

210
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,970
I've seen you here before.

211
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,360
Your name is.

212
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,010
don't tell me,um,begins with "M.

213
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,210
- Lilly.
- Lilly.

214
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:31,960
What's in your hand,lilly?

215
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,630
Asklepius.

216
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,290
The god of healing.

217
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,830
I know you'll heal our people.

218
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,530
But I thought.

219
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,980
the old gods are fighting back.

220
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,850
those capacitors are still hot.

221
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,090
Watch yourself,chief.

222
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,170
Take my glove.

223
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,970
Frak me.

224
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,210
My fault,didn't get swapped out.

225
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:29,330
Yeah,we could have died.

226
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,250
- Was that in your pocket?
- We don't have to do this.

227
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:35,770
You're right,we're okay.

228
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,230
It's okay.

229
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,700
Is it?

230
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:39,960
Skulls,is it?

231
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:40,660
Galen.

232
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,680
I don't need to be patted on the head.

233
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:42,960
You can tell me I frakked up.

234
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:44,150
Nobody got hurt,ok?

235
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:44,990
Forget it.

236
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,440
- You're only human.
- No!

237
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:47,730
Don't say that!

238
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,020
Tell me I frakked up!

239
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,360
Say it!

240
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,280
Tell me I frakked up!

241
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,710
Any one of you.

242
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,220
Cowards!

243
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:00,020
Chief,uh,I can handle this.

244
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,130
Why don't you take a little down time?

245
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,880
Get out of the raptor,figurski.

246
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:30,390
people have room in their 
hearts for one great belief,

247
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,920
you or the old gods.

248
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,280
Which one will it be?

249
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:42,360
Why can't I just be a man?

250
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,340
Do I really need to take on 
the gods single-handed?

251
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:50,480
Oh,but imagine the kind of man 
you'll be when you do.

252
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:58,260
Surely such a man must be magnificent,
larger-than-life,godlike himself.

253
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,540
What are you talking about?

254
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:04,330
It's not about that at all.

255
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,300
It's about this.

256
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,470
Stop!

257
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,750
Stop.

258
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,200
This is unacceptable.

259
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,610
We have been targeted because of 
what we believe by those

260
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:38,140
who answer to faceless gods that bear 
no relevance in our world.

261
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:40,380
They want us to be afraid.

262
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,870
And I'm tired of being afraid.

263
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:49,740
The time has come to make a stand.

264
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,340
And that time is now.

265
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,230
Gaius,what-- what are you doing?

266
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,460
Where are you going?

267
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:02,570
Gaius?

268
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:08,980
We ****** These stupid old gods!

269
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,080
Sir,we're having a service.

270
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,050
Are you?

271
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,630
But whom are you serving?

272
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,490
- I have to ask you to leave.
- Do you?

273
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:17,190
Would you be serving zeus?

274
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,220
Apparently,king of the gods,
who also happened to be,

275
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,220
let me tell you,a serial rapist.

276
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,950
Prone to giving birth out 
of his own forehead.

277
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,450
That's very likely,isn't it?

278
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:27,210
Well,gods strike me down.

279
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,690
- Oh,what are you going to do?
- Damn you.

280
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,930
You ignorant witch,telling 
the people lies and stories.

281
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,290
Maybe you want me to pray to asklepius,

282
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,410
who healed wounds with the 
blood of gorgons,

283
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:40,850
or aphrodite or artemis or 
any other of this rubbish!

284
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,520
How awful!

285
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,990
Out of the way,you hideous old witch.

286
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:48,790
That's the kind of rubbish that you made!

287
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:51,190
I will not be destroyed at this level!

288
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,250
Am I that late?

289
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,400
No,this wasn't a treatment.

290
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,770
It was just a blood test.

291
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,910
You brought a new book?

292
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,550
Uh,yes.

293
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:13,020
Something different this time.

294
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,160
It's a classic.

295
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,100
My favorite.

296
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:18,460
Searider falcon,I haven't read it in years.

297
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,010
I don't remember how it ends.

298
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,190
I don't either.I never read the ending.

299
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,910
You're kidding.It's your favorite.

300
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,460
I like it so much,I don't want it to be over.

301
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,160
So I'm saving it.

302
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,840
Maybe I should do that.

303
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,070
That's a bad idea.Maybe not.

304
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,410
Let me do that for you.

305
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,580
Okay,thanks.

306
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,800
Baltar's back at home in the brig again.

307
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,750
Desecration of a temple.

308
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:53,890
It's his revenge for what
happened to him this morning.

309
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,220
It was brutal.

310
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:59,890
I have my personnel trying to track down 
anything on the sons of ares.

311
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,210
But nobody's talking.

312
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,870
The thing is that baltar knows that there 
are religious hardliners in dogsville,

313
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:07,060
but he continues to provoke.

314
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:10,350
I just can't have a religious war in this fleet.

315
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,640
Oh,please,no.

316
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:14,940
Then the whole damn thing will become our 
frakkin' responsibility,yours and mine.

317
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:18,050
Seriously,bill,we have 30,000 people 
left and they're not happy

318
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,320
unless they're kicking each other's teeth in.

319
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,920
This is what we've become?

320
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,160
No,it's him.

321
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:29,010
Baltar has an uncanny way of 
stirring up all the crap.

322
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:36,150
I wonder if he'd be willing to stay in lockdown,
indefinitely,for his own safety.

323
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,290
And make a martyr out of him?No way.

324
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:44,100
Those girly,groupie,sex whatever-they-are,
they already think he's a god.

325
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,950
So we kick him off of the galactica.

326
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,160
No,I want him close.

327
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:51,120
I'm going to the brig.

328
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,920
You want to see him?

329
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:56,030
I want him to see me.

330
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:05,150
Oh,we didn't even make it to tomorrow,did we?

331
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,260
You asked what I want.

332
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,220
I want to know how it feels to have 
killed billions of human beings,

333
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:15,020
to have all that blood on your hands.

334
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:18,140
Think it through.

335
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,470
Because that's what I want.

336
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,050
I feel it.

337
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:26,150
Do you really think that I couldn't?

338
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,790
Do you?

339
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,480
Or do you turn it off?

340
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:33,820
Is there a switch in your 
head that you turn off?

341
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:37,320
You talk like we're different,
but you know we're not.

342
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,010
Weapons.

343
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,640
Working late,or up early,chief?

344
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,760
You act like you think 
I'm made of switches and relays.

345
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,460
Look.

346
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,170
veins,not wires.

347
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,820
We're the same.

348
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,220
Do you see we're the same?

349
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:40,350
Then tell me.

350
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,070
Tell you what?

351
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:47,330
How you live with what you've done.

352
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:55,680
Saul,are you asking for absolution?

353
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:58,540
Forgiveness?

354
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:02,300
I can give you that.

355
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:05,680
Stand down.

356
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:08,680
Step outside.

357
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:18,620
Just tell me what the trouble is.

358
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:27,010
No.You have nothing to offer me.

359
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,190
We're not the same.

360
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,250
Were you asleep?

361
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,940
What is it this time?

362
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,840
Here to strip-search me?

363
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:45,390
Or could it possibly be 
that your presence here

364
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,800
means that the president has been 
made aware of my situation.

365
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,100
It's being looked into.

366
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,660
- Is it really?
- Aggressively.

367
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,070
Now here's the thing.

368
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,620
I want you to look at me,gaius.

369
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,360
Just look at me.

370
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,390
This is a wig.

371
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,720
I'm dying.

372
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:20,490
Now,if you look in my eyes.

373
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,980
go ahead,look.

374
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,260
You can probably see it.

375
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,660
I'm very sorry.

376
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:28,180
No,no,no,no,I don't want your pity.

377
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:29,230
I'm still doing my job.

378
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:33,880
In fact,I'm gonna aggressively pursue 
the men that attacked you.

379
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:39,770
And I'm going to limit the size of public 
assemblies to protect your people,but.

380
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:43,470
I'm going to be slipping away 
from this life very soon.

381
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,950
And I've gotten kind of curious as 
to what that's going to be like,

382
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:49,010
and so,I did some research.

383
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,620
And there are some people who say that

384
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,590
when people are getting closer to their death,

385
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:58,080
they just don't care as much about rules 
and laws and conventional morality.

386
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,350
Are you threatening me?

387
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:02,890
No,no,I'm just saying have a quiet life.

388
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:06,230
And I'll die a quiet little death.

389
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,540
And everyone will be happy.

390
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:13,460
It's just that I'm not in the 
mood any longer to indulge you.

391
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:15,470
And that'S.

392
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:20,170
all.

393
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:27,220
And you are being released,so.

394
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,370
stay safe.

395
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:47,880
Hey,chief.

396
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:57,580
We all miss her,chief.

397
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:01,470
I understand if you need some time off.

398
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:05,600
Or even if you might need more 
shifts to keep yourself busy.

399
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:07,890
No one knows how they're going 
to react to loss like this,

400
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,510
or what they're gonna need.

401
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:13,200
I don't need special treatment.

402
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:19,510
I guess she just couldn't take it,huh?

403
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:21,840
Being married to a cylon?

404
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,860
Being the mother of a half-breed abomination?

405
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,320
- *****
- Thank you.

406
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,220
She was a good woman.

407
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:49,430
If you really believe that,
you wouldn't have threatened

408
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:52,620
to stick her up against a bulkhead and shoot her.

409
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,480
It's okay,though.

410
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:00,870
I thought about doing it many times myself.

411
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:01,890
Believe me.

412
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,710
Chief,it's...

413
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,470
how many of us ended up with the people 
we really wanted to be with?

414
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,080
Got stuck with the best of limited options?

415
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,960
And why?

416
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:22,530
Because the ones we really wanted,
the really loved,were dead and dying,

417
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,380
or turned out to be cylons 
and they didn't know it.

418
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,690
If boomer had.

419
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:29,340
- listen.
- if I had known.

420
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,620
- Listen,let'S.
- no.

421
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:33,010
- Let's go.
- No,no.

422
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,990
I didn't know.

423
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,990
- let's go home
- I didn't know.

424
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:41,030
So I buried my head in the sand 
and I took it and I settled!

425
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,460
I settled for that shriek,
those dull vacant eyes,

426
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,900
the boiled cabbage stench of her.

427
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:50,520
And why?Because this is my life!

428
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:52,960
This is the life I picked.

429
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:55,360
And it's fine,but you know what?It's not.

430
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:56,850
I didn't pick this life.

431
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,860
This is not my frakkin' life.

432
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,020
What the hell's gotten into you?

433
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,840
Don't do this.

434
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,930
Don't do this to her memory.

435
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,290
You know what?

436
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,120
I'm sorry if I'm not gonna do this 
the way you want me to,

437
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,000
or the way you might.

438
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:14,800
But I will not make an angel out of 
someone who wasn't an angel.

439
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,410
But I can see you have.

440
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,400
And now you've come down here to be in my club,

441
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,300
but you're not in my club.

442
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,050
You don't know what frakkin' club I'm in

443
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:27,640
'cause you never asked the right questions.

444
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:30,030
Chief,let's get out of here.

445
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,410
No.

446
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,070
Why don't you go?

447
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,410
Take care of your precious ship.

448
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:35,620
Stop it.

449
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,590
Stop all of this.

450
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:39,760
'Cause if you don't,I'm going to have to act on it.

451
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:41,320
- Now shut up.
- Great!

452
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,450
Do it!

453
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:43,140
Please!

454
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,520
For the love of gods,please demote me.

455
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:48,150
Get me off your frakkin' ship!

456
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:58,210
Specialist tyrol,I want you off my hangar 
deck before you endanger another pilot.

457
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:05,160
You're to report to petty officer bassom 
tomorrow morning at 0600 for reassignment.

458
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,470
Do you understand?

459
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,580
of course you have authority 
over emergency measures,

460
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:58,170
but you bulldozed this through 
after the session was closed.

461
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,730
Yes ****

462
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,610
It's a crowd control measure.

463
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:06,010
I also authorized the repair of a cargo elevat
or do you want to talk about that too?

464
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:06,670
Crowd control?

465
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:08,300
Looks to me like it was 
pretty well designed purely

466
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,570
to stop gaius baltar's organization.

467
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:12,170
You mean his cult?

468
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:14,350
Well his "cult" was attacked.

469
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:16,770
And from what I'm hearing around the fleet,

470
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:17,840
it was pretty brutal.

471
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,100
It was brutal.

472
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,230
Exactly.

473
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:24,230
And this measure is designed explicitly 
to protect those people.

474
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,470
If they aren't gathering en masse,
they aren't provokreg sentment.

475
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:31,180
But limits his group,while 
permitting more mainstream worship.

476
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,370
wherever gaius baltar is,violence happens.

477
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,530
And if he doesn't cause it,he draws it.

478
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:43,560
My job,mr.Adama,is and always will be,
to keep the people safe.

479
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:47,710
Madame president,
I have to wonder tifhis resolution

480
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:50,730
couldn't be used against other 
offshoot religious groups.

481
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,950
Absolutely not.

482
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,450
Gaius baltar is a special case.

483
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,580
You know that.

484
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,710
And we're making him a special case.

485
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:57,650
And how are we doing that?

486
00:30:57,770 --> 00:30:58,940
We're fueling his argument.

487
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,370
I mean,after all,is he preaching violence?

488
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:01,750
- Immoral acts?
- I don't know.

489
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:05,060
I haven't been to one of his...
what are they called?Services?

490
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:09,240
It's not that far from what some of 
our own mithras followers believe.

491
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:11,440
We have mithrasaries among the gemenese.

492
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,160
Can this order be applied to them?

493
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:14,240
Clear your heads.

494
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,310
We are talking about gaius baltar.

495
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:20,950
Everyone in this room 
experienced tragedy at new caprica.

496
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:22,650
Have we forgotten?

497
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,110
Will you open this order 

498
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,620
- to a full quorum vote?
- No.

499
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,550
we can override,madam president.

500
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:32,190
I cannot let this stand.

501
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,260
You can override,and you cannot 
let this stand,mr.Adama?

502
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,090
Then you open it up to a vote.

503
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:42,250
And if you strike this down,
you can all go back to your constituents

504
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,640
and you can tell them what you've done,

505
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,810
and "we,the people," will have triumphed.

506
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:48,360
But think about what it's gonna cost you.

507
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:52,310
Because every single one of you remembers

508
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:56,260
what it was like when gaius 
baltar had political power.

509
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:59,060
And you should be terrified to think about

510
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:03,100
what this man will do with 
blind religious devotion.

511
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,100
So go ahead.

512
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,860
Vote.

513
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,810
Should I get used to waking up to this face?

514
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,480
You're traveling light.

515
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:38,110
An informal chat.

516
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:40,330
Just you and me.

517
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:43,070
and the man watching through the cameras.

518
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:46,060
You haven't answered my question.

519
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,840
You want to know how I work?

520
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,220
If I can turn off pain?

521
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,890
Can you?

522
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:56,110
I want the pain.

523
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,910
It's how I learn.

524
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:04,800
I was instrumental in the 
destruction of humanity.

525
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,660
But at the same time,I learned because.

526
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:11,100
because I fell in love.

527
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,980
With a human man.

528
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,470
And he was mortal.

529
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:20,120
And fallible.

530
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,080
And he had this incredible pride in himself.

531
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:27,650
He thought he knew everything there was to know.

532
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:32,010
And I loved him with my whole heart.

533
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:40,510
And then one day,I realized 
I wouldn't have him forever.

534
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,660
I understood what I'd done.

535
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,440
How I betrayed him and humanity.

536
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:56,040
And that pain taught me to understand death.

537
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,400
Baltar could die.

538
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:02,500
- And I loved him.
- No.

539
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:05,350
- Baltar's heart was ephemeral.
- No.

540
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:08,150
Baltar's body was fragile in my hands.

541
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:12,570
No,we are not gonna talk about the 
fragile body of gaius frakkin' baltar!

542
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:13,900
Door!

543
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:15,420
Door!

544
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,580
Dismissed.

545
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:19,230
Clear out,out!

546
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:22,140
Frak,what's he gonna do to her?

547
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,210
I can tell you how to turn it off.

548
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,380
How?

549
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,050
Pain is how I learn from the guilt.

550
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:37,090
There's wisdom there.

551
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:37,820
Clarity.

552
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:39,710
You know yourself there.

553
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:40,960
Pain.

554
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,980
Our minds were designed based on your minds.

555
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:49,670
We learn things about how you work 
that you've never known.

556
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:58,760
When you're in pain,that's 
when you learn who you really are.

557
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:05,900
That's when you focus,
sharp as the point of a knife.

558
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:19,710
I can give you that clarity again.

559
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:25,350
I'm sorry,sir,I'm not supposed to let you enter.

560
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,460
What's going on?What are you doing?

561
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:28,480
There are 12 people inside already.

562
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:29,560
You can count,can you?

563
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:33,410
Yes,sir,you can't enter without 
breaking emergency provision 170.

564
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,730
People,let me out.

565
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:35,520
- If I leave,then he can come in.
- Yes,if she leaves,

566
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,500
- then I can come in.
- We're asking everyone 

567
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:38,900
- to stay inside for safety reasons.
- Oh,this is absurd.

568
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:40,640
- You're just counting heads.
- I have my orders.

569
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:41,900
Yeah,but I live here,okay?

570
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:43,710
I live here,and so do some of these women.

571
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,340
Where are we supposed to go?

572
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,660
this is your moment,gaius.

573
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,980
Step forward.Make a stand.

574
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:54,490
Uh,I don't want to be a hero.

575
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,790
I just want to go to bed.

576
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,230
- Go to sleep.
- Look at me.

577
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,790
I promise you.

578
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:02,020
Step forward,and you will not be hurt.

579
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,430
- Promise me?
- Yes,

580
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,330
you can lie down inside.Go in.

581
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:11,440
Stop,sir.

582
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:14,500
gaius!

583
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:26,920
Get your frakkin' hands off me,
you frakkin' freak machine!

584
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:42,280
Can you feel it,saul?

585
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,960
Can you feel the clarity of it?

586
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:57,370
stay down or clear this area,sir!

587
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:59,300
You have to do this.

588
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,920
The gain will outweigh the cost.

589
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:14,960
I want to stay down.

590
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,150
I really want to stay down.

591
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:17,650
No,you don'T.

592
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:29,800
Stay down,please,sir!

593
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,470
Wait,wait,stop!

594
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,900
Lieutenant.

595
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,380
Stand down.

596
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,830
The quorum has just met 
in an emergency session.

597
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:40,170
Full right of assembly has been restored.

598
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:45,230
You can,uh,you can go back into your home.

599
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:46,690
- No one will stop you.
- Oh,gaies.

600
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:54,710
thank you

601
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,530
I don't do these things for you.

602
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,260
You do them because your god compels you.

603
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,570
Okay,okay.

604
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,870
Lee has no idea.

605
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:20,270
He really has no idea.

606
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:25,050
Have you heard anything I said?

607
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:29,940
There are pragmatic realities he refuses to face.

608
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,880
Well,that'pra oblem,of course.

609
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:37,500
He's doing what he thinks is right.

610
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,560
Well,yeah,he's lee.

611
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:44,290
Thing is,it probably is the right thing,but.

612
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:48,550
sometimes the right thing is a luxury.

613
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,270
And it can have profoundly dangerous consequences.

614
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:56,030
And yet it's almost as if he 
doesn't want that to be true.

615
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,760
Okay,I gotta stop this.

616
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:02,310
I'm not supposed to get upset during treatment.

617
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:06,060
Will you read the next chapter?

618
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,630
I must warn you that I'm getting into 
the part that I haven't read yet.

619
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,060
Oh dear.

620
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,370
Are you going to be able to continue?

621
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,490
Chapter 7:

622
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:31,370
The raft was not as seaworthy as I had hoped.

623
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:35,020
The waves repeatedly threatened to swamp it.

624
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:37,310
I wasn't afraid to die.

625
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:43,310
I was afraid of the emptiness that I felt inside.

626
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,740
I couldn't feel anything.

627
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:53,870
That's what scared me.

628
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:57,580
It came into my thoughts.

629
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,010
It filled them.

630
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,330
It felt good.

631
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:07,230
More.

632
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:10,150
No.

633
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,530
Keep going.

634
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:16,070
No,I made a mistake.

635
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,020
This isn't what you need.

636
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,660
I'm not a priest.

637
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:33,120
I've never even been a particularly good man.

638
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:41,960
I have,in fact,been a profoundly selfish man.

639
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,490
But that doesn't matter,you see.

640
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:49,600
Something in the universe loves me.

641
00:40:54,020 --> 00:41:00,930
Something in the universe 
loves the entity that is me.

642
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:04,860
I will choose to call this something "god.

643
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:10,610
A singular spark that dwells 
in the soul of every living being.

644
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:15,300
If you look inside yourself,
you will find this spark too.

645
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,370
You will.

646
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,480
But you have to look.

647
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:24,020
Deep.

648
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:27,330
Love your faults.

649
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:30,730
Embrace them.

650
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:35,900
If god embraces them,
then how can they be faults?

651
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:38,190
Love yourself.

652
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,630
You have to love yourself.

653
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:48,370
If we don't love ourselves,
how can we love others?

654
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:53,240
and when we know what we are,

655
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:57,220
then we can find the truth out about others.

656
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:58,990
See what they are.

657
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:01,860
The truth about them.

658
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:09,650
And you know what the truth is,
the truth about them.

659
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:12,310
About you.

660
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,470
About me.

661
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:16,790
Do you?

662
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:29,260
The truth is we are all perfect,
just as we are.

663
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:33,330
God only loves that which is perfect,
and he loves you.

664
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,860
He loves you because you are perfect.

665
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:42,170
You are perfect just as you are.
