1
00:01:00,032 --> 00:01:01,347
I could use a drink.

2
00:01:20,503 --> 00:01:23,453
You've always been there for me
when I need you.

3
00:01:28,151 --> 00:01:30,631
- You just go to sleep.
- I'm sleepy.

4
00:01:31,664 --> 00:01:33,764
I'm so exhausted.

5
00:01:46,676 --> 00:01:48,711
<i>I'd do it all again.</i>

6
00:02:46,735 --> 00:02:48,635
Will you help me up, please?

7
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,734
It's okay. You can do that much.

8
00:03:09,536 --> 00:03:10,536
Thank you.

9
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,260
You're very kind.

10
00:03:27,684 --> 00:03:30,125
Among bright stars, I'm lost.

11
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:36,366
- You're not lost. I'm right here.
- There's a new tide.

12
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,235
And all the forgotten faces,
all the forgotten children...

13
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,690
we seek
the great forgotten language.

14
00:03:44,854 --> 00:03:47,255
It's gonna be okay.
We made it through the mutiny.

15
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,770
Not yet, he hasn't.
He's got a bullet in his brain.

16
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,022
- Then take it out!
- The colony never forgets.

17
00:03:52,288 --> 00:03:53,816
See that pale spot over there?

18
00:03:54,704 --> 00:03:57,654
That's a massive hematoma
pressing on his brain.

19
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,285
We gotta drill holes in his skull
and drain it.

20
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:04,322
When the swelling goes down, I'll bring
the brain guy over from Inchon Velle

21
00:04:04,447 --> 00:04:06,745
and we get a look and see
how we can get at that bullet.

22
00:04:07,065 --> 00:04:10,457
- The mind is its own place.
- Get the frakkin' brain guy.

23
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,961
We don't need a specialist yet.
I can drill.

24
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:17,080
- And a hell of heaven.
- I'm right here, Sam.

25
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,466
He whose guile...

26
00:04:22,885 --> 00:04:24,918
- stirred with revenge.
- I'm right here, Sam.

27
00:04:25,043 --> 00:04:26,390
I'm not gonna go anywhere.

28
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:29,935
Give it a rest, Starbuck.
He's talking, but he can't hear you.

29
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,503
Just shut up and drill.

30
00:04:32,177 --> 00:04:34,177
And all the forgotten faces...

31
00:04:34,887 --> 00:04:35,816
We seek...

32
00:04:36,955 --> 00:04:38,105
He's in pain!

33
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,246
That's just a reflex.

34
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:52,942
We'd been to that beach too.

35
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:56,477
Yes, we'd been to that beach.

36
00:04:58,149 --> 00:05:00,399
Sometimes Ellen would be there too.

37
00:05:01,127 --> 00:05:03,027
Because she loved the water.

38
00:05:07,031 --> 00:05:08,531
She loved the water.

39
00:05:25,415 --> 00:05:26,802
Hello, John.

40
00:05:27,644 --> 00:05:30,496
I don't care for that name.
I think you know that.

41
00:05:31,032 --> 00:05:32,932
I named you after my father.

42
00:05:33,496 --> 00:05:36,585
And you made me in his image.
Thanks a million for that.

43
00:05:38,197 --> 00:05:41,397
I'd love a drink, John.
If it's not too much trouble.

44
00:05:41,704 --> 00:05:44,221
I take it you're here
because things didn't go very well

45
00:05:44,346 --> 00:05:47,054
down on New Caprica
with you and the mister?

46
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:49,661
I betrayed the resistance,
and he poisoned me.

47
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:53,331
- Nothing like true love.
- He did what he thought was right.

48
00:05:53,552 --> 00:05:55,352
That's all any man can do.

49
00:05:56,078 --> 00:05:57,328
He's not a man.

50
00:05:59,302 --> 00:06:02,552
As someone with first-hand knowledge,
I beg to differ.

51
00:06:04,218 --> 00:06:06,699
He's a machine. So are you.

52
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,284
I think that depends
on how you define things.

53
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:12,162
Your ancestors
didn't crawl up out of the swamp.

54
00:06:12,412 --> 00:06:14,050
Personally,
I'm rather proud of that.

55
00:06:14,175 --> 00:06:16,375
You really haven't changed at all,
have you?

56
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:17,939
On the contrary,

57
00:06:18,592 --> 00:06:21,359
I've made vast improvements.
You'd be astonished.

58
00:06:21,484 --> 00:06:24,006
And yet, you're still
the same confused

59
00:06:24,131 --> 00:06:26,427
and petulant little boy
I loved so dearly

60
00:06:26,697 --> 00:06:28,197
all those years ago.

61
00:06:28,982 --> 00:06:29,982
It's sad.

62
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,516
I had such high hopes for you.

63
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,259
And I for you.

64
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:38,023
Unfortunately, it appears
you still stick to delusional thinking

65
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:41,525
instead of accepting
the reality of your life for what it is.

66
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:44,149
Humans have a word for that, Ellen.

67
00:06:44,274 --> 00:06:45,474
Schizophrenia.

68
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:50,355
You used my name, John.
That's good.

69
00:06:50,766 --> 00:06:52,516
There's hope for you yet.

70
00:06:56,476 --> 00:06:57,541
We'll talk later.

71
00:07:01,231 --> 00:07:02,046
John.

72
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,603
It's a bit cold in here.

73
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:08,179
I'll get you some clothes.

74
00:07:08,665 --> 00:07:10,915
After all, I've seen it all before.

75
00:07:19,544 --> 00:07:21,273
The mutiny did enough damage.

76
00:07:21,493 --> 00:07:22,396
Now what?

77
00:07:22,521 --> 00:07:24,913
I first noticed it
when I pulled the sync coil.

78
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:33,072
You're gonna need to go all the way down
to the hull to see how far down it goes.

79
00:07:36,512 --> 00:07:37,414
Do it.

80
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:39,166
Excuse me?

81
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,084
I know it's not your job.

82
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:44,816
Thing is, is I need a chief.

83
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:47,079
And all I have is a...

84
00:07:48,547 --> 00:07:49,510
is a Galen.

85
00:07:50,076 --> 00:07:51,553
That you do, sir.

86
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,671
See, you still call me "sir".

87
00:07:55,445 --> 00:07:57,559
I think we have to accept
what we are.

88
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,796
Will you accept the title, Chief?

89
00:08:02,975 --> 00:08:05,249
- I'm still a Cylon.
- It's all right.

90
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,091
So's my XO.

91
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,559
- Fix my ship, Chief.
- Yes, sir, Admiral.

92
00:08:32,135 --> 00:08:33,135
Kara.

93
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:37,979
I've seen everything.

94
00:08:39,745 --> 00:08:43,034
- Sam, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- No, no.

95
00:08:44,367 --> 00:08:47,484
I never should have taken you out of
that jail cell. I should have killed...

96
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,943
No. It's okay. It's okay.

97
00:08:50,659 --> 00:08:53,310
It's about as far from okay
as it could possibly be.

98
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,359
You wanna blame someone? Blame me.

99
00:08:56,627 --> 00:08:59,288
No, it's all right.
Kara, listen to me.

100
00:09:00,174 --> 00:09:02,749
A wonderful thing has happened.
You have to get the others.

101
00:09:04,121 --> 00:09:05,180
What others?

102
00:09:05,305 --> 00:09:07,955
Galen and Tory
and Saul and Ellen. Please.

103
00:09:10,777 --> 00:09:12,220
Ellen's dead, Sam.

104
00:09:14,343 --> 00:09:15,343
Of course.

105
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:17,299
Of course. I know.

106
00:09:17,844 --> 00:09:20,280
There's too many layers.
Just get the rest of them.

107
00:09:20,405 --> 00:09:22,855
Please tell them
I remember everything.

108
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:24,132
Earth.

109
00:09:24,915 --> 00:09:26,165
Why we're here.

110
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,449
Everything.

111
00:09:29,086 --> 00:09:30,611
I've seen everything.

112
00:09:34,506 --> 00:09:37,793
BATTLESTAR GALACTICA
Season 4 - Episode 15

113
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,949
Subtitles
-=( Lords of Kobol )=-

114
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:23,038
You know, I've often wondered

115
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,624
what changes the mortal experience
would have on you.

116
00:10:25,994 --> 00:10:28,512
I never seriously considered
the answer would be

117
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,135
virtually none.

118
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:34,091
Do you still suffer from night sweats
and scary dreams

119
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:37,844
of dog-faced boys
chasing you through the yellow mists?

120
00:10:38,242 --> 00:10:39,242
Sleep...

121
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:43,314
that's a good example of a supremely
unproductive human attribute

122
00:10:44,258 --> 00:10:46,853
that for some reason
you chose to write into our software.

123
00:10:47,746 --> 00:10:51,346
Fortunately, I was able to delete
that particular subroutine.

124
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,880
And I stopped sleeping

125
00:10:54,037 --> 00:10:55,320
about 20 years ago.

126
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:56,488
Fine.

127
00:10:56,656 --> 00:11:00,267
If you really think we poisoned you
with human traits like sleep,

128
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,620
and Centurion values
like belief in a living God,

129
00:11:03,932 --> 00:11:06,583
why then did you spend
all these years

130
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:10,127
in single-minded pursuit
of such human ideas

131
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:11,802
as vengeance and murder?

132
00:11:11,927 --> 00:11:14,965
Why not just choose to explore
this notion of being

133
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,243
the best machines
the universe has ever known?

134
00:11:17,368 --> 00:11:19,368
Because justice pulls me back.

135
00:11:19,985 --> 00:11:23,473
My forebears
on the Centurion side of the family

136
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:27,041
were the slaves of humanity.
And I want justice for that.

137
00:11:28,661 --> 00:11:30,898
Doesn't have to be this way, John.

138
00:11:39,134 --> 00:11:40,157
Lunch has arrived.

139
00:11:40,486 --> 00:11:41,498
Here, dear.

140
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,940
Put it here.

141
00:11:43,065 --> 00:11:44,494
I believe you've met this Eight.

142
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:47,164
- You knew her as Sharon Valerii.
- Boomer.

143
00:11:47,691 --> 00:11:51,043
I can't tell you how good it is
to see another person I know.

144
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:54,713
I'm assuming there's a whole ship full
of my children out beyond the guards.

145
00:11:55,892 --> 00:11:57,711
There's no need to be shy.

146
00:11:58,646 --> 00:12:01,229
Tell her how it feels
to be in the resplendent presence

147
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:03,888
of one of the fabulous Final Five.

148
00:12:04,013 --> 00:12:05,307
He's taking a risk,

149
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:06,851
exposing you to me.

150
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,181
It's not easy winning his trust.

151
00:12:09,663 --> 00:12:12,437
- How'd you do it?
- We achieved a certain rapport.

152
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,566
Really?

153
00:12:15,013 --> 00:12:17,348
You're full of surprises
today, John.

154
00:12:17,473 --> 00:12:20,001
- That's his real name, by the way.
- No it's not. I hate it.

155
00:12:20,126 --> 00:12:23,325
Tell me more about this rapport
you have with John.

156
00:12:25,956 --> 00:12:28,680
He's teaching me
to be a better machine.

157
00:12:28,805 --> 00:12:30,567
To let go of my human constructs.

158
00:12:30,692 --> 00:12:32,830
What about the swirl?
Has he taught you that yet?

159
00:12:32,955 --> 00:12:34,961
If you'll excuse me,
I have some people to kill.

160
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,880
Why, John, I think you're blushing.

161
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:38,687
It's just the faulty blood pressure

162
00:12:38,812 --> 00:12:41,272
in this miserable body
you designed for me.

163
00:12:41,397 --> 00:12:43,387
No, no, no.
You should stay.

164
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:46,577
Stay and have a heart-to-heart
with your creator here.

165
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,706
You can ask her
why she made you the way you are.

166
00:12:49,831 --> 00:12:52,104
Self-destructive. Hyper emotional.

167
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,863
Torn apart by conflicting impulses.

168
00:12:54,988 --> 00:12:58,638
Tell her how extraordinarily happy
this makes you.

169
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,081
You know why he brought you in here?

170
00:13:12,006 --> 00:13:13,549
He likes an audience.

171
00:13:14,135 --> 00:13:17,254
Someone to nod
when he talks about justice.

172
00:13:17,662 --> 00:13:19,060
Watch, Boomer.

173
00:13:20,595 --> 00:13:22,259
Make up your own mind.

174
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:34,688
We all worked
in the same research facility. You

175
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,649
and Ellen, you were married then too.
You two lived together.

176
00:13:39,178 --> 00:13:41,073
- What, like roommates?
- No,

177
00:13:41,729 --> 00:13:44,781
you were madly in love.
You were planning on getting married.

178
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:50,620
When the nukes hit,
I pulled Ellen out of the rubble.

179
00:13:51,325 --> 00:13:54,934
She said we'd be reborn.
Does that mean we downloaded somewhere?

180
00:13:55,059 --> 00:13:57,669
Yeah, on a ship that we placed
in orbit around the planet.

181
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:01,298
- So we knew the end was coming.
- We'd been warned, yeah.

182
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:02,799
- We downloaded.
- Yeah.

183
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,968
But the Cylons on Earth
could have children.

184
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:08,018
- Why did we even have that technology?
- Probably invented resurrection.

185
00:14:08,143 --> 00:14:11,224
You're cold as ice. You have a bullet
in your head. You wanna take a break?

186
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:14,274
I still have so much more to tell them.
We didn't invent resurrection.

187
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,969
Okay, we reinvented it.

188
00:14:16,152 --> 00:14:19,691
Organic memory transfer came from Kobol,
along with the 13th Tribe.

189
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,068
It fell out of use
after our people started to procreate.

190
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:25,697
We worked night and day
to rebuild it. Galen,

191
00:14:26,504 --> 00:14:29,081
your work was amazing.
But it was Ellen...

192
00:14:29,771 --> 00:14:32,579
It was Ellen who made the intuitive leap
that brought the system back online...

193
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:35,917
I said you could have five minutes.
It's been over a half an hour.

194
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,210
Good Gods, man.
You're soaked in sweat.

195
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,170
- He said he was okay.
- Ishay, get in here.

196
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:43,379
- What was the plan?
- Look, Colonel, you may be the XO,

197
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,091
but in sick bay, I call the shots.

198
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:48,011
Now everybody, out, right now.
Out, out, out.

199
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:52,904
He said he was okay.

200
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,310
Gods.

201
00:15:09,981 --> 00:15:11,906
Gods, so much killing.

202
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,503
Look at this picture of Jacob.

203
00:15:15,628 --> 00:15:18,792
This is just a terrible picture.
He'd hate it. I'm trying...

204
00:15:19,723 --> 00:15:23,510
I'm trying to find another one because
everyone will see it up on that wall.

205
00:15:25,053 --> 00:15:26,902
You sure you want to be here?

206
00:15:27,607 --> 00:15:29,622
Yes, I definitely want to be here.

207
00:15:31,803 --> 00:15:32,954
It's such a...

208
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:36,815
senseless, horrible way to die.

209
00:15:38,377 --> 00:15:41,356
These people only wanted
to try and keep us civilized.

210
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:44,630
Sometimes I hated them,
but I knew every one of them,

211
00:15:45,353 --> 00:15:47,806
and now I wonder
who we are without them.

212
00:15:51,568 --> 00:15:53,285
Well, actually, I've been thinking.

213
00:15:53,748 --> 00:15:55,036
We need a new Quorum

214
00:15:55,295 --> 00:15:56,632
or something else.

215
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,374
These... these old planets,

216
00:15:59,996 --> 00:16:01,918
that's not who we are anymore.

217
00:16:03,822 --> 00:16:05,563
We're a fleet now, and

218
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:09,333
our daily lives are defined
by the ship we're on.

219
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:10,885
We're not Capricans anymore.

220
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,390
We're from Galactica.
We're from Colonial One.

221
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:15,140
Maybe we should acknowledge that.

222
00:16:16,052 --> 00:16:20,053
I think that that's a very
excellent observation, Lee,

223
00:16:20,178 --> 00:16:22,909
and I think
that you should keep it in mind

224
00:16:23,034 --> 00:16:25,525
when you are assembling
new representatives.

225
00:16:26,161 --> 00:16:30,165
- When I assemble new representatives?
- I will, of course, remain by title

226
00:16:30,376 --> 00:16:31,818
as President, but...

227
00:16:32,954 --> 00:16:34,534
You can do a lot more than that.

228
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,440
No, I can't, Lee.

229
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:39,795
It's time I let someone else
do the heavy lifting.

230
00:16:45,862 --> 00:16:47,525
I don't know what to say.

231
00:16:50,414 --> 00:16:53,411
I would be honored
if you think I'm the right one.

232
00:16:55,146 --> 00:16:58,642
You are the right one, Lee.
You have always been the right one.

233
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:01,080
My only concern about you

234
00:17:01,608 --> 00:17:04,886
is that you're so hell-bent
on doing the right thing

235
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:09,150
that you sometimes
don't do the smart thing.

236
00:17:12,672 --> 00:17:14,320
I'll try and be smarter.

237
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:15,575
And wronger.

238
00:17:28,784 --> 00:17:31,049
I gotta warn ya. It looks bad.

239
00:17:34,498 --> 00:17:35,556
Frak me.

240
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,634
How many are like this?

241
00:17:38,018 --> 00:17:41,726
There's about a dozen bad spots,
the length of the ship.

242
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:45,358
If they go,
this thing'll slam shut like a book.

243
00:17:45,483 --> 00:17:46,773
How'd it get this bad?

244
00:17:47,114 --> 00:17:49,275
Galactica was 50 years old
when the war started.

245
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,676
Put her through some things
that would crush lesser ships.

246
00:17:53,352 --> 00:17:55,254
Slammed her down on the atmosphere.

247
00:17:55,422 --> 00:17:57,502
Most ships aren't built to spec.

248
00:17:57,627 --> 00:18:00,440
There's lots of places
where the skin's too thin.

249
00:18:00,608 --> 00:18:02,545
And the bolts are just too small.

250
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:05,125
You're frakkin' telling me
they cut corners?

251
00:18:05,555 --> 00:18:06,788
Yeah, they did.

252
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:11,059
But these big cracks,

253
00:18:11,184 --> 00:18:14,142
it's a good, clean break.
I can fix that, you just...

254
00:18:15,825 --> 00:18:18,271
Just don't jump her for a while.

255
00:18:20,276 --> 00:18:22,574
I can squeeze
some more life out of her.

256
00:18:24,778 --> 00:18:25,778
Okay.

257
00:18:26,076 --> 00:18:27,317
But the crew...

258
00:18:27,928 --> 00:18:29,980
I want it all human, all right?

259
00:18:35,393 --> 00:18:36,393
Yes, sir.

260
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:43,747
So why did we go to the 12 colonies?

261
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:46,070
We needed to find the other tribes
and warn them.

262
00:18:46,195 --> 00:18:48,510
We knew they would continue
to create artificial life.

263
00:18:48,635 --> 00:18:50,319
We needed to tell them...

264
00:18:50,804 --> 00:18:54,078
Treat them well. Keep 'em close.
But by the time we got to the colonies,

265
00:18:54,203 --> 00:18:57,549
they were already at war
with the Centurions. It happened again.

266
00:18:58,226 --> 00:19:02,015
But the holocaust on Earth took place
thousands of years before that.

267
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:04,601
- How is that possible?
- We hadn't developed jump drives.

268
00:19:04,953 --> 00:19:07,479
We traveled at relativistic
but subluminal speed.

269
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:11,082
Time slowed down for us,
but thousands of years had passed...

270
00:19:12,156 --> 00:19:13,443
Just give me a second.

271
00:19:14,895 --> 00:19:17,417
- Cottle said to stop...
- Kara, I'm fine. I have to do this.

272
00:19:17,542 --> 00:19:20,724
You remember the Demetrius. You know
what it is when you've something to do.

273
00:19:20,849 --> 00:19:21,964
I used to.

274
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:24,246
If I had the answers for you...

275
00:19:24,605 --> 00:19:26,982
The answers about why you came back,
what you're supposed to do,

276
00:19:27,107 --> 00:19:29,027
you would want me
to tell you, right?

277
00:19:29,152 --> 00:19:30,152
Do you?

278
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:31,266
Kara, no.

279
00:19:31,797 --> 00:19:33,546
But so much is coming back.
Maybe.

280
00:19:34,556 --> 00:19:36,580
Please. Let me keep going.

281
00:19:39,281 --> 00:19:42,555
The Centurions were already
trying to make flesh bodies.

282
00:19:43,104 --> 00:19:45,730
They had created the hybrids,
but nothing that lived on its own,

283
00:19:45,855 --> 00:19:48,961
so we made them a deal:
you stop the war, and we'll help you.

284
00:19:49,997 --> 00:19:53,441
We developed the eight humanoid models,
and we gave them resurrection.

285
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,527
Eight?

286
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:58,027
You said eight.
We're missing someone.

287
00:20:02,765 --> 00:20:04,195
Everybody's glowing.

288
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:10,834
Get Doc Cottle! Get him.
Get Doc Cottle!

289
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:13,913
Get Doc Cottle!

290
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,374
I always did love a good slideshow.

291
00:20:27,281 --> 00:20:28,434
Vacation snaps?

292
00:20:29,403 --> 00:20:30,620
You know what it is.

293
00:20:30,745 --> 00:20:33,642
The Temple of Hopes,
built by the 13th tribe

294
00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:36,559
3,000 years ago
when they left Kobol.

295
00:20:36,893 --> 00:20:39,821
They stopped and prayed for guidance
during their exodus,

296
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:42,332
and then God showed them
the way to Earth.

297
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:45,210
And now it's a monument
to your vanity.

298
00:20:45,747 --> 00:20:47,429
The Temple of the Five.

299
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:50,039
Nice touch, the exploding star.

300
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:54,067
When the star went nova,
one of your children saw your faces.

301
00:20:54,992 --> 00:20:56,170
One of the Threes.

302
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,492
The one who called herself D'Anna.

303
00:20:59,229 --> 00:21:01,818
So I just boxed her entire line.

304
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,928
Boxing isn't permanent.

305
00:21:04,818 --> 00:21:06,418
Not like number Seven.

306
00:21:06,895 --> 00:21:08,195
You can undo it.

307
00:21:08,477 --> 00:21:09,507
It's not likely.

308
00:21:09,954 --> 00:21:13,040
By planting that carnival trick
to reveal your own faces,

309
00:21:14,004 --> 00:21:17,154
- you left me no choice.
- We didn't plant anything.

310
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:20,394
We backtracked the path
of our ancestors,

311
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:21,969
found their temple.

312
00:21:22,607 --> 00:21:24,866
The one true God must have
orchestrated these events.

313
00:21:27,084 --> 00:21:27,994
John?

314
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:30,709
In all your travels,

315
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,458
have you ever seen a star supernova?

316
00:21:37,277 --> 00:21:38,392
Well, I have.

317
00:21:39,814 --> 00:21:41,338
I saw a star explode

318
00:21:41,463 --> 00:21:44,463
and send out the building blocks
of the universe.

319
00:21:45,082 --> 00:21:46,932
Other stars, other planets,

320
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:49,569
and eventually, other life.

321
00:21:50,212 --> 00:21:51,459
A supernova.

322
00:21:52,701 --> 00:21:53,946
Creation itself.

323
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:56,813
I was there. I wanted to see it.

324
00:21:57,342 --> 00:21:59,067
And be part of the moment.

325
00:21:59,271 --> 00:22:01,065
And you know how I perceived

326
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:03,873
one of the most glorious events
in the universe?

327
00:22:05,274 --> 00:22:09,278
With these ridiculous
gelatinous orbs in my skull.

328
00:22:10,716 --> 00:22:12,687
With eyes designed to perceive

329
00:22:12,812 --> 00:22:15,722
only a tiny fraction
of the EM spectrum.

330
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:20,021
With ears designed only to hear
vibrations in the air.

331
00:22:20,146 --> 00:22:23,883
The five of us designed you
to be as human as possible.

332
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:25,719
I don't want to be human!

333
00:22:26,949 --> 00:22:28,646
I want to see gamma rays.

334
00:22:28,771 --> 00:22:31,190
I want to hear x-rays.
And I want to...

335
00:22:31,794 --> 00:22:33,548
I want to smell dark matter.

336
00:22:34,831 --> 00:22:36,960
Do you see
the absurdity of what I am?

337
00:22:37,085 --> 00:22:39,380
I can't even express
these things properly

338
00:22:39,505 --> 00:22:42,804
because I have to...
I have to conceptualize complex ideas

339
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:45,738
in this stupid limiting
spoken language.

340
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,920
But I know I want
to reach out with something

341
00:22:48,045 --> 00:22:50,453
other than these prehensile paws

342
00:22:51,147 --> 00:22:54,547
and feel the solar wind
of a supernova flowing over me.

343
00:22:56,971 --> 00:22:58,171
I'm a machine.

344
00:22:59,983 --> 00:23:01,525
And I could know much more.

345
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,525
I could experience so much more.

346
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,898
But I'm trapped in this absurd body.

347
00:23:06,274 --> 00:23:07,218
And why?

348
00:23:08,025 --> 00:23:10,596
Because my five creators thought

349
00:23:10,951 --> 00:23:13,235
that God wanted it that way.

350
00:23:23,075 --> 00:23:24,610
You have something to say?

351
00:23:26,647 --> 00:23:28,598
Don't you feel
the slightest bit of remorse

352
00:23:28,723 --> 00:23:30,183
for what you did to him?

353
00:23:31,275 --> 00:23:32,326
What you did to us?

354
00:23:36,571 --> 00:23:38,271
Because he's wrong, Boomer.

355
00:23:38,838 --> 00:23:41,578
There's no need
for remorse or blame.

356
00:23:42,526 --> 00:23:44,026
We didn't limit you.

357
00:23:44,419 --> 00:23:46,385
We gave you something wonderful.

358
00:23:47,213 --> 00:23:48,366
Free will.

359
00:23:50,409 --> 00:23:52,620
The ability to think creatively.

360
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,549
To reach out to others
with compassion.

361
00:23:55,998 --> 00:23:57,461
- To love.
- Love?

362
00:23:59,464 --> 00:24:00,396
Who?

363
00:24:01,088 --> 00:24:02,089
Humans?

364
00:24:03,339 --> 00:24:05,112
Why would I want to do that?

365
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,612
Who would I want to love?

366
00:24:12,528 --> 00:24:15,495
Are they still in there?
We're running out of time.

367
00:24:15,664 --> 00:24:17,413
You heard what he said, right?

368
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,357
The Centurions
couldn't build skin jobs,

369
00:24:19,482 --> 00:24:22,184
so we showed them how,
then gave them resurrection.

370
00:24:22,619 --> 00:24:24,045
It all traces back to us.

371
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:26,930
No, he said that we ended
the first Cylon war.

372
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:29,525
We bought time for humanity, right?

373
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:32,901
The old man said
humans had to own up to what they made.

374
00:24:33,026 --> 00:24:36,432
But we made the skin jobs.
It's all about what we made.

375
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:38,465
The destruction of the colonies.

376
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:40,661
But the humans on Kobol made us.

377
00:24:42,403 --> 00:24:44,341
Go back far enough,
it's always them.

378
00:24:44,466 --> 00:24:46,508
Yeah, you point a finger
back far enough

379
00:24:46,633 --> 00:24:49,411
and some germ gets blamed
for splitting in two.

380
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:52,903
Maybe we share the guilt
with the humans,

381
00:24:53,028 --> 00:24:55,728
but we don't get
to just shove it off onto them.

382
00:24:56,124 --> 00:24:57,370
What are they doing?

383
00:24:57,653 --> 00:25:00,665
Some picture of his brain.
Some kind of scan of something.

384
00:25:03,128 --> 00:25:06,246
No, it's true. In a way,
the seizure was actually a good thing.

385
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:08,487
It let me get in there
and take this new picture.

386
00:25:08,612 --> 00:25:11,236
Look what I found.
That's your bullet.

387
00:25:11,772 --> 00:25:14,095
You see how it's lodged there
in the vascular ring.

388
00:25:14,475 --> 00:25:16,848
That's where all of the major arteries
converge.

389
00:25:17,423 --> 00:25:19,806
The vascular ring,
that's what binds the thoughts

390
00:25:19,931 --> 00:25:21,933
in tight sheaves in the field,
you need that.

391
00:25:22,058 --> 00:25:23,966
I'm good. I'm here.
I'm good.

392
00:25:25,847 --> 00:25:29,443
Okay, what's really fascinating is
how it's eroded this blood vessel here.

393
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:31,028
And in fact, it leaked.

394
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:33,739
It was just the tiniest squirt of blood.
Caused your entire seizure.

395
00:25:33,908 --> 00:25:36,409
It's remarkable, really.
Of course, if it happens again,

396
00:25:36,578 --> 00:25:39,120
we're talking major hemorrhage.
I mean, death within minutes.

397
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:41,831
So take out the frakkin' bullet.

398
00:25:42,164 --> 00:25:43,834
We need to repair that blood vessel.

399
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:47,176
Luckily, the swelling's gone down,
so I think we have a shot at this thing.

400
00:25:47,301 --> 00:25:48,087
Hold on.

401
00:25:48,415 --> 00:25:51,465
These memories
that I've been recovering,

402
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:54,531
- is there any chance I'll lose them?
- When you dig around in the brain,

403
00:25:54,656 --> 00:25:57,722
there's always the possibility
of ancillary damage.

404
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:02,345
Then we need to hold off
until I... that circle start and...

405
00:26:03,782 --> 00:26:06,272
- The words are...
- Something's obviously wrong with him.

406
00:26:06,441 --> 00:26:07,675
- What is it?
- Aphasia.

407
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,818
It's affected his language center.
We call it "word salad".

408
00:26:12,316 --> 00:26:13,717
It's not unusual.

409
00:26:13,998 --> 00:26:16,616
Starbuck, this boy has a bullet
that needs to come out,

410
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,033
and he's asking us to wait.

411
00:26:18,158 --> 00:26:20,292
If I kick this decision
over to you as the wife,

412
00:26:20,417 --> 00:26:22,944
- what would you do?
- Wait, what?

413
00:26:23,069 --> 00:26:26,206
No, that's not the first opening...
That's not...

414
00:26:26,461 --> 00:26:28,809
That's not the random motor...

415
00:26:28,934 --> 00:26:31,338
That's... Frak it. Godsdamn it.

416
00:26:31,508 --> 00:26:33,614
Kara, I'm okay.

417
00:26:34,064 --> 00:26:34,884
I'm fine.

418
00:26:35,254 --> 00:26:36,441
Okay? I'm okay.

419
00:26:36,566 --> 00:26:38,763
Please, don't take this
away from me.

420
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:41,641
I need more time, okay?

421
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:47,772
Prep for surgery.

422
00:26:48,908 --> 00:26:51,055
Please. Please.
I need more time.

423
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,277
So much is coming back to me.
Just a little more time.

424
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:58,658
You have until they knock you out.
That's all I've got.

425
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:00,316
That's... Until they knock me out,

426
00:27:00,441 --> 00:27:01,862
and as long as...

427
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:03,543
You have the words, Sam.

428
00:27:03,668 --> 00:27:05,992
If I can just complete the circle,
I can get the words.

429
00:27:06,117 --> 00:27:09,171
He has a remarkably clear image.

430
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:15,967
FOUR MONTHS AGO

431
00:27:28,356 --> 00:27:30,406
Well, that's a nice wakeup call.

432
00:27:44,063 --> 00:27:45,803
Something's happened.

433
00:27:45,939 --> 00:27:48,040
They've destroyed
the resurrection hub.

434
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:51,236
Begun contemplating your mortality?

435
00:27:52,563 --> 00:27:53,780
More than that.

436
00:27:54,563 --> 00:27:55,881
Our extinction.

437
00:27:57,966 --> 00:28:00,815
- Always so dramatic.
- It's true, Ellen.

438
00:28:02,001 --> 00:28:03,464
We can't procreate biologically,

439
00:28:03,589 --> 00:28:06,827
so we're going to have to find
a way to rebuild resurrection.

440
00:28:07,572 --> 00:28:10,244
- Well, good luck with that.
- Don't need luck.

441
00:28:11,404 --> 00:28:12,815
We need your help.

442
00:28:12,984 --> 00:28:15,985
They destroyed the hub, but they don't
even know about the colony.

443
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:18,184
All your equipment is still there.

444
00:28:19,441 --> 00:28:21,657
I only know
part of the system, John.

445
00:28:21,876 --> 00:28:24,689
It would take all 5 of us to rebuild it,
and even then, I'm not sure...

446
00:28:24,814 --> 00:28:26,376
- You're lying.
- No, I'm not, John.

447
00:28:26,501 --> 00:28:28,370
Don't insult my intelligence.

448
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:31,196
Your children are dying, Ellen.

449
00:28:31,321 --> 00:28:33,657
And you won't lift
a finger to save us?

450
00:28:34,597 --> 00:28:36,171
Why? Out of spite?

451
00:28:36,672 --> 00:28:39,285
Because I refuse
to kneel to your orthodoxy?

452
00:28:39,844 --> 00:28:42,688
Now you finally see the truth
about your Final Five.

453
00:28:42,813 --> 00:28:44,353
Just tell us.

454
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:47,714
- Tell us about resurrection.
- I can't. It would take all of us.

455
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:49,185
You see how she forces me.

456
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,878
You're no better
than the humans that enslaved us.

457
00:28:55,626 --> 00:28:58,382
If you don't tell me
how to rebuild resurrection,

458
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:00,988
I'm gonna cut open your head...

459
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,146
And look for it there.

460
00:29:05,374 --> 00:29:06,826
The brain is a marvelous thing.

461
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:09,038
It's a big electrical grid.

462
00:29:09,251 --> 00:29:11,582
Just lay it open,

463
00:29:12,015 --> 00:29:13,918
stimulate it at the right places,

464
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:16,626
and I can trigger
your deepest memory.

465
00:29:16,751 --> 00:29:19,126
Your deepest fears.
Your deepest guilt.

466
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,176
And even the recipe
for life everlasting.

467
00:29:29,335 --> 00:29:31,348
So Cavil was the first one we made?

468
00:29:31,473 --> 00:29:33,140
John.
We treasured him.

469
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:35,683
He helped us...
build the others.

470
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:38,189
So we didn't think
this was a bad idea?

471
00:29:38,314 --> 00:29:40,834
Building Cylons after we had
already seen the cycle?

472
00:29:40,959 --> 00:29:43,002
The Centurions had
a single loving God.

473
00:29:43,127 --> 00:29:44,997
Ellen said it changed everything.

474
00:29:45,122 --> 00:29:47,854
If the Cylons embraced
love and mercy,

475
00:29:47,979 --> 00:29:49,688
then the cycle
of violence could end.

476
00:29:49,813 --> 00:29:52,041
Single God?
Like a one, true God?

477
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:53,124
Yeah.

478
00:29:53,523 --> 00:29:56,093
- And that came from the Centurions?
- Yeah.

479
00:29:56,625 --> 00:29:57,938
Cavil rejected mercy.

480
00:29:58,063 --> 00:30:00,132
He had a twisted idea of morality.

481
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:02,375
So he turned on the five of us.

482
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,017
He trapped us in a... a thing.

483
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:07,376
The pocket.
It's a compartment.

484
00:30:07,501 --> 00:30:10,015
- And then he took the O2 offline.
- He suffocated us.

485
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:11,795
- He killed us.
- Yeah.

486
00:30:12,124 --> 00:30:14,018
So when we downloaded
into new bodies...

487
00:30:14,306 --> 00:30:16,311
He blocked our access
to our books...

488
00:30:16,436 --> 00:30:18,977
No...
Our memories...

489
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:21,664
- And implanted us with false ones.
- Yes.

490
00:30:21,789 --> 00:30:23,348
Set us up, like a Boomer,

491
00:30:23,874 --> 00:30:25,739
memories that we thought were real.

492
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:28,200
I guess he boxed us for a while.

493
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,625
Introduced Saul first,
not long after the war.

494
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,195
And then the gazelle.

495
00:30:32,611 --> 00:30:34,498
The... the Ellen.

496
00:30:35,123 --> 00:30:36,333
And back on Earth,

497
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:38,874
the warning signs...
They looked different to each one of us.

498
00:30:38,999 --> 00:30:40,546
I saw a woman.
Tory, you saw a man.

499
00:30:41,128 --> 00:30:42,925
Funny. No one...
No one else could see them.

500
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:45,129
- Galen, you thought...
- That's it, it's time to go.

501
00:30:45,254 --> 00:30:47,261
Listen to me.
The Seven. Tell me please.

502
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:49,408
- Please tell me.
- Yes, Seven... Seven...

503
00:30:49,533 --> 00:30:51,640
Seven was the Daniel.

504
00:30:52,748 --> 00:30:55,823
- You sure about the word?
- Yes. He died. Daniel died.

505
00:30:55,948 --> 00:30:57,124
He was Seven.

506
00:30:57,249 --> 00:30:59,899
- Okay, take him.
- I'm sure. It was Daniel. I'm sure.

507
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,532
- We need to finish.
- Let him go.

508
00:31:01,657 --> 00:31:03,999
Saul, listen to me.
Saul, stay with the fleet.

509
00:31:04,197 --> 00:31:06,449
It's all starting to happen.
It's the miracle. Right here.

510
00:31:06,574 --> 00:31:08,935
It's a gift from the angels.
Stay with the fleet!

511
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:11,994
Kara, make 'em stop!
I stood up for you on Demetrius!

512
00:31:12,239 --> 00:31:13,457
You owe me!

513
00:31:13,998 --> 00:31:14,998
Kara!

514
00:31:26,688 --> 00:31:27,688
Saul?

515
00:31:27,813 --> 00:31:28,811
How'd it go?

516
00:31:28,936 --> 00:31:30,238
Oh, you're awake.

517
00:31:32,467 --> 00:31:33,835
Where's the booze?

518
00:31:34,649 --> 00:31:36,758
We haven't had any around for weeks.

519
00:31:37,438 --> 00:31:39,855
Remember? The smell of it
was making me sick.

520
00:31:45,374 --> 00:31:46,676
Was that weeks?

521
00:31:49,305 --> 00:31:50,986
I'm glad you're back.

522
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,503
What did he have to say?

523
00:31:53,628 --> 00:31:55,321
Cottle kicked us out.

524
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:57,522
He never got to finish.

525
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,890
I'm sorry.

526
00:32:01,846 --> 00:32:03,537
Something new started.

527
00:32:04,812 --> 00:32:08,131
He's been moving like he just
came alive tonight.

528
00:32:10,773 --> 00:32:12,334
Just tonight, huh?

529
00:32:17,623 --> 00:32:19,248
I don't feel anything.

530
00:32:19,373 --> 00:32:20,904
Wait. He'll do it again.

531
00:32:21,029 --> 00:32:24,435
You know, we should get,
like, a crib

532
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,979
and all the stuff that a baby...

533
00:32:33,248 --> 00:32:36,120
He moved.
I felt it this time. I did.

534
00:32:38,686 --> 00:32:40,688
I felt my son move.

535
00:32:42,407 --> 00:32:44,382
He wants to come out and play.

536
00:32:52,152 --> 00:32:53,720
That's a little dated, isn't it?

537
00:32:54,062 --> 00:32:56,181
He needs a patch over his right eye.

538
00:32:56,498 --> 00:32:59,810
I prefer to remember Saul
before you did that to him.

539
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,728
Sentimental till the end.

540
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,414
The Simons are prepping the OR.

541
00:33:05,294 --> 00:33:09,025
You'll be impressed with the progress
we've made in memory recovery.

542
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:10,321
It might take a while.

543
00:33:10,698 --> 00:33:13,866
I'm sure you'll make the procedure
as long and painful as possible.

544
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:16,126
You're mistaken
if you think I enjoy this.

545
00:33:16,383 --> 00:33:17,583
Come on, John.

546
00:33:18,928 --> 00:33:21,578
Of course you do.
You're a sadist.

547
00:33:22,701 --> 00:33:25,278
Why not just kill us
and be done with it?

548
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:27,880
Why send us to live
among the humans?

549
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:30,713
I wanted you to see
what they're like up close and personal.

550
00:33:31,131 --> 00:33:33,469
So I gave you all grandstand seats
to a holocaust.

551
00:33:37,271 --> 00:33:38,683
But we didn't die.

552
00:33:39,195 --> 00:33:42,186
And then you decided
that we hadn't suffered enough.

553
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:45,009
So you picked me up,
put me on a transport,

554
00:33:45,134 --> 00:33:46,961
took Galen's confession,

555
00:33:47,086 --> 00:33:49,109
played resistance fighter with Sam,

556
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:52,193
tortured Saul, but didn't kill him.

557
00:33:53,053 --> 00:33:55,032
You had a dozen chances.

558
00:33:55,316 --> 00:33:57,685
But you wanted to wait
so that when it finally happened,

559
00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:00,037
when we'd download back,
we'd be ready

560
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:01,935
to admit we were wrong

561
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,667
and pat you on the head
for giving us the right amount

562
00:34:04,835 --> 00:34:08,821
of suffering, the right amount
of punishment, all weighed out.

563
00:34:09,813 --> 00:34:12,043
Then we could give you the approval

564
00:34:12,648 --> 00:34:14,551
that you've always craved.

565
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:20,202
You see, you claim
to be a perfect machine,

566
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:24,354
but you are driven
by the most petty of human emotions.

567
00:34:25,114 --> 00:34:26,114
Jealousy

568
00:34:26,756 --> 00:34:27,756
and rage.

569
00:34:30,783 --> 00:34:33,237
I know what you did to Daniel.

570
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,662
That seven didn't thrive.

571
00:34:38,059 --> 00:34:39,059
Sad.

572
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:43,062
And it's too bad we're not made out
of something more sturdy.

573
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,710
Metal.

574
00:34:45,043 --> 00:34:46,252
That might be nice.

575
00:34:47,797 --> 00:34:50,921
Daniel was an artist.
And so sensitive to the world.

576
00:34:52,332 --> 00:34:54,326
I was very close to him.

577
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:57,288
But John decided
I was playing favorites.

578
00:34:57,666 --> 00:34:58,724
Maybe I was.

579
00:34:59,074 --> 00:35:01,658
Someone contaminated
the amniotic fluid

580
00:35:01,783 --> 00:35:05,378
in which we were maturing
all the Daniel copies.

581
00:35:06,211 --> 00:35:09,041
And then corrupted
the genetic formula.

582
00:35:09,325 --> 00:35:10,922
I knew it was John.

583
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:12,440
Envious.

584
00:35:12,887 --> 00:35:15,409
- Sadistic.
- And who made me?

585
00:35:16,509 --> 00:35:19,273
That's what we're dancing
around here, isn't it?

586
00:35:19,877 --> 00:35:21,410
If I'm so irredeemable,

587
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:23,156
if I'm such a mistake,

588
00:35:23,572 --> 00:35:24,872
if I'm so broken,

589
00:35:25,394 --> 00:35:26,896
then whose fault is that?

590
00:35:27,356 --> 00:35:29,700
It's my maker's fault.
And that's not God.

591
00:35:29,825 --> 00:35:32,880
- That's you. This is on you.
- No, no, John.

592
00:35:33,394 --> 00:35:37,235
God, no,
you have done terrible things.

593
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,303
But you are not a mistake.

594
00:35:39,777 --> 00:35:42,602
If you could just accept yourself
as what you are,

595
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,657
as the boy I made,

596
00:35:45,267 --> 00:35:46,518
you can be good.

597
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:48,876
You can be anything.

598
00:35:50,378 --> 00:35:51,871
I love you, John,

599
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:54,347
because I made you.

600
00:35:58,386 --> 00:35:59,520
It's okay.

601
00:36:04,084 --> 00:36:05,161
It's okay, John.

602
00:36:06,068 --> 00:36:08,071
- It's...
- Don't you dare!

603
00:36:11,596 --> 00:36:13,325
I've gotta scrub for surgery.

604
00:36:13,608 --> 00:36:17,048
I can't wait to see what perfection
looks like on the inside.

605
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:33,063
No, no, down there. Yeah.

606
00:36:34,382 --> 00:36:36,457
Across the beams.
Cross, not lengthways.

607
00:36:36,582 --> 00:36:37,819
Run a support there.

608
00:36:38,077 --> 00:36:40,385
I know what patching
looks like, Chief.

609
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:42,982
This isn't about
those cracks, Admiral.

610
00:36:44,741 --> 00:36:47,245
I started thinking
about damage that you can't see.

611
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:50,977
You know, stuff that's deeper in.
That you normally see on an x-ray.

612
00:36:51,202 --> 00:36:52,334
Dealino, fire it up.

613
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:54,431
Okay, Chief. It's online.

614
00:36:54,556 --> 00:36:57,467
We prepped the beam
with this liquid that fluoresces.

615
00:36:58,376 --> 00:37:00,801
Now it's not an x-ray,
but you get the idea.

616
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,097
It's throughout the entire ship.

617
00:37:06,087 --> 00:37:08,461
Hairline fractures in all the beams.

618
00:37:10,347 --> 00:37:11,897
It's in her bones, Admiral.

619
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,122
Her bones are rotten.

620
00:37:20,851 --> 00:37:23,804
I have an idea. There's something
on the baseship that can help.

621
00:37:25,442 --> 00:37:27,111
Cylon technology?

622
00:37:27,236 --> 00:37:30,211
It's this organic resin.
It'll grow into the metal.

623
00:37:30,336 --> 00:37:33,333
Make it stronger.
It'll take the load as it matures.

624
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:35,434
As it matures?

625
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:38,380
It's biological.

626
00:37:38,628 --> 00:37:40,339
Out of the question, Chief.

627
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:43,051
All due respect, Admiral.
You asked me to do this job.

628
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,850
- What's your life worth to you?
- No.

629
00:37:53,336 --> 00:37:54,338
I'm sorry.

630
00:37:55,546 --> 00:37:57,058
I'm so very sorry.

631
00:37:57,842 --> 00:37:59,146
I was greedy.

632
00:38:00,072 --> 00:38:03,095
I kept you too long.
I thought maybe I was the seven.

633
00:38:03,685 --> 00:38:05,169
I need to be something.

634
00:38:05,433 --> 00:38:07,200
I'll be here as soon as you wake up.

635
00:38:07,805 --> 00:38:09,914
And I'll give you
all the time that you want.

636
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:11,674
We'll learn all the secrets, okay?

637
00:38:11,799 --> 00:38:13,392
Okay, here we go.

638
00:38:15,102 --> 00:38:17,169
All right, Kara,
time for you to leave.

639
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:19,700
Here we go.

640
00:38:21,177 --> 00:38:23,091
- Thank you.
- Let's go. Retractor.

641
00:38:23,766 --> 00:38:24,787
Thank you.

642
00:39:28,875 --> 00:39:30,432
How do you stand it?

643
00:39:31,979 --> 00:39:34,496
Knowing that he hates you
for the things you've done?

644
00:39:34,847 --> 00:39:36,340
Maybe he doesn't.

645
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:39,028
Love's like that sometimes.

646
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:45,250
The Simons are ready for the surgery.
They'd like you to put this on.

647
00:39:46,636 --> 00:39:50,639
A prop to legitimize John's
final bit of theatre. No, thank you.

648
00:39:55,281 --> 00:39:57,241
You should have brought a tumbrel.

649
00:39:58,766 --> 00:39:59,983
Never mind.

650
00:40:00,902 --> 00:40:02,399
Let's get this over with.

651
00:40:26,981 --> 00:40:28,231
Still in there?

652
00:40:31,253 --> 00:40:34,186
Doc said, like, two hours.
Been in there a lot longer than that.

653
00:40:34,311 --> 00:40:36,892
We only needed a little more.

654
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:40,270
I wanted to ask him
about that frakking song.

655
00:40:40,395 --> 00:40:42,147
- Ask him when he gets out.
- Starbuck,

656
00:40:42,562 --> 00:40:44,107
I got something for ya.

657
00:40:46,614 --> 00:40:47,736
There's your bullet.

658
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:50,155
Doc plucked it outta there
and repaired the artery.

659
00:40:50,829 --> 00:40:51,990
He's gonna live.

660
00:40:53,265 --> 00:40:54,554
When's he gonna wake up?

661
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:56,717
I'm actually surprised
he's not awake by now.

662
00:40:58,207 --> 00:41:00,332
That's not necessarily a bad thing.

663
00:41:00,501 --> 00:41:02,256
His brain is repairing itself.

664
00:41:02,381 --> 00:41:05,712
We're hooking up an EEG,
and gonna see what's going on.

665
00:41:08,744 --> 00:41:09,756
Go ahead.

666
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:13,249
Boomer,
have you really thought about this?

667
00:41:13,374 --> 00:41:14,363
I have.

668
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,602
You're gonna regret
your part in this.

669
00:41:16,727 --> 00:41:18,133
I'm sure I will.

670
00:41:18,258 --> 00:41:20,564
- What are you doing?
- Forgiving you.

671
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:48,008
Hey, Sam.

672
00:41:50,488 --> 00:41:52,008
You're gonna be okay.

673
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:54,859
You got a room
full of rabid Cylon-types

674
00:41:54,984 --> 00:41:58,584
that can't wait to hear
the next chapter of their life story.

675
00:41:59,956 --> 00:42:02,041
I think they're hoping
for a musical.

676
00:42:03,094 --> 00:42:04,771
So you better hurry up
and get better.

677
00:42:05,441 --> 00:42:07,941
They're starting
to look a little mean.

678
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,485
- Don't bother.
- Excuse me?

679
00:42:10,702 --> 00:42:13,572
There's almost no brain activity.
He doesn't hear you.

680
00:42:15,952 --> 00:42:17,574
He's not in there.

681
00:42:32,673 --> 00:42:34,008
Give me the chief.

682
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:42,056
This is the chief.

683
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:44,058
Chief...

684
00:42:46,225 --> 00:42:48,565
Do whatever you have to do
to save our girl.

685
00:42:51,793 --> 00:42:52,787
Yes, sir.
