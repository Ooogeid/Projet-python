1
00:00:00,085 --> 00:00:02,975
<i>Previously on </i>
Battlestar Galactica...

2
00:00:04,068 --> 00:00:06,248
Hairline fractures in all the beams.

3
00:00:06,418 --> 00:00:09,550
Her bones are rotten. There's something
on the baseship that can help.

4
00:00:10,187 --> 00:00:13,125
It's this organic resin.
It'll grow into the metal.

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,081
Strengthens it as it matures.

6
00:00:15,444 --> 00:00:17,433
Oh, my Gods.

7
00:00:17,702 --> 00:00:19,060
It's Ellen Tigh.

8
00:00:19,337 --> 00:00:22,104
Nice to see you again.
This is Boomer.

9
00:00:22,384 --> 00:00:23,384
Marines.

10
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,940
Take this number Eight to the brig.

11
00:00:33,618 --> 00:00:36,218
If that's me lying there,
then what am I?

12
00:00:36,977 --> 00:00:38,471
What am I?

13
00:00:54,957 --> 00:00:57,765
<i>Reveille, reveille.
Up all bunks and turn two.</i>

14
00:00:58,663 --> 00:01:01,894
<i>Sweep down all compartments.
Empty all trash cans.</i>

15
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:05,339
<i>Make a clean sweep fore and aft.</i>

16
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:09,026
<i>Lay below to the master-at-arms office
for muster,</i>

17
00:01:09,327 --> 00:01:11,078
<i>all restricted personnel.</i>

18
00:01:45,812 --> 00:01:46,897
Attention on deck.

19
00:01:49,148 --> 00:01:50,248
Have a seat.

20
00:01:51,467 --> 00:01:53,120
It's 0621.

21
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:57,972
Sync with me in three, two, one.

22
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,119
Hack 0621.

23
00:02:02,051 --> 00:02:04,331
Our mission is the same this week...

24
00:02:04,841 --> 00:02:08,273
as it was the week before that,
and the week before that.

25
00:02:08,398 --> 00:02:10,800
We'll be flying Viper CAPs
in conjunction

26
00:02:10,925 --> 00:02:13,466
with heavy Raider pickets
from the baseship.

27
00:02:13,651 --> 00:02:16,886
Those of you who just came back
from six-day planet hunts

28
00:02:17,668 --> 00:02:20,818
will get two days local duty
before going out again.

29
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:24,922
Remember, the first one
who sights a habitable rock

30
00:02:25,047 --> 00:02:28,811
will get this fine
oral hygiene product.

31
00:02:28,936 --> 00:02:32,336
It is the last tube of Tauran toothpaste
in the universe.

32
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,970
Gods know most of you need it.

33
00:02:36,494 --> 00:02:39,200
Our mission is the same this week

34
00:02:39,376 --> 00:02:41,202
as it was the week before that,

35
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,784
and the week before that.

36
00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:46,251
Planet hunters, make sure to draw
long duration provisions.

37
00:02:46,376 --> 00:02:48,876
If those clapped-out FTLs
go down when you're out there,

38
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:52,439
you're gonna get mighty hungry waiting
for the SAR birds to find you.

39
00:02:52,564 --> 00:02:55,735
As you know,
the mutiny has thinned our ranks.

40
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,845
We cannot give
all you Raptor jocks back-seaters.

41
00:03:00,515 --> 00:03:03,876
Savor this alone time,
but do not whack too much.

42
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,103
We need you to conserve your O².
Learn to savor your alone time.

43
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:10,356
Wank as little as possible.
Conserve your O².

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,985
Planet search assignments
are on the duty board.

45
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,404
Be advised the repairs
to Galactica will continue

46
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,323
to cause sporadic power outages.

47
00:03:19,647 --> 00:03:21,534
Six has the color assignments

48
00:03:22,015 --> 00:03:25,287
and your recognition signals.
Engines start at 0710.

49
00:03:25,473 --> 00:03:26,623
Good hunting.

50
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:32,989
So the stop-drilling
and the shoring compound

51
00:03:33,114 --> 00:03:35,841
will buy the Galactica
a few more jumps.

52
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,510
But not many.

53
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:41,119
- How many?
- Impossible to say...

54
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:43,438
until the hull caves in.

55
00:03:43,994 --> 00:03:47,294
But we're not ready
to give up on the old girl just yet.

56
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:51,354
Well, if there's nothing else,
Sonja...

57
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:54,729
I wanna congratulate you
on your election.

58
00:03:54,854 --> 00:03:56,777
I look forward to seeing you
taking your seat

59
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,930
in the Quorum of ship's captains
next week.

60
00:03:59,055 --> 00:04:01,472
Thank you,
but you should know something.

61
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,368
When we convene, I intend to formally
request that the Eight you're holding

62
00:04:05,538 --> 00:04:07,037
in Galactica's brig...

63
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:08,914
be returned to us.

64
00:04:09,497 --> 00:04:11,876
- Boomer?
- Yes, Sharon Valerii.

65
00:04:12,203 --> 00:04:14,253
She put two holes in me.

66
00:04:14,648 --> 00:04:17,066
I'm afraid I didn't word that right.

67
00:04:17,191 --> 00:04:20,509
We don't want Boomer set free.
We wanna try Boomer for treason.

68
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:27,453
Sharon Valerii sided with Cavil
in the Cylon civil war,

69
00:04:27,797 --> 00:04:30,247
which killed thousands
of our comrades.

70
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,800
And if she's convicted?

71
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:37,793
Before the civil war, resurrection
made capital punishment pointless.

72
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:40,236
But now that we're all mortal...

73
00:04:40,361 --> 00:04:41,911
You want to kill her.

74
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:51,410
BATTLESTAR GALACTICA
Season 4 - Episode 17

75
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,871
Subtitles
-=( Lords of Kobol )=-

76
00:05:51,507 --> 00:05:55,100
- There's a lot still going on in there.
- Dr. Gerard said these readings

77
00:05:55,225 --> 00:05:57,687
are unprecedented and,
frankly, bizarre.

78
00:05:57,812 --> 00:05:59,812
They haven't changed in weeks.

79
00:06:00,028 --> 00:06:04,032
And there is nothing to indicate that
he's having any conscious thought.

80
00:06:04,544 --> 00:06:07,992
Well, maybe his brain is rebooting.
Reorganizing as it heals.

81
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,954
The last thing we need is you jerking
our chains with a lotta quack ideas.

82
00:06:12,402 --> 00:06:14,289
Why don't you take them
someplace else?

83
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:19,736
What if we could link him
to a datastream like our hybrids?

84
00:06:19,861 --> 00:06:21,911
His eyes were closed last time.

85
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,330
Well, that's not unusual in a coma.

86
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,318
Doesn't mean anything.

87
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:29,503
You're gonna have
to come to grips with that.

88
00:06:30,734 --> 00:06:32,884
And how am I supposed to do that?

89
00:06:33,466 --> 00:06:35,666
You need to get on with your life.

90
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:39,052
If there's any change,
you'll be the first one to know.

91
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,011
Gods damn it.

92
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,638
Do you have to continue
to play the same lame-ass song?

93
00:07:11,763 --> 00:07:13,013
Give it a rest.

94
00:07:14,088 --> 00:07:17,488
I'm not playing the same lame-ass song.
I'm composing it.

95
00:07:17,685 --> 00:07:19,635
Been at it for four days now.

96
00:07:20,092 --> 00:07:21,092
It's hell.

97
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:24,276
So then quit. What's the point?

98
00:07:25,809 --> 00:07:26,809
The point?

99
00:07:28,596 --> 00:07:31,547
The point is to bring a little grace
and beauty to an otherwise

100
00:07:31,672 --> 00:07:35,201
- ugly and brutal existence.
- Gimme a frakking break.

101
00:07:35,751 --> 00:07:38,935
Is that what you were doing when
the Cylons attacked the 12 colonies?

102
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,858
Did your music stop one missile?

103
00:07:44,695 --> 00:07:46,645
Pretty cynical point of view.

104
00:07:49,842 --> 00:07:51,642
Something happened to you.

105
00:07:53,535 --> 00:07:54,535
Yeah.

106
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,202
I wonder what it could be.

107
00:07:57,772 --> 00:08:00,718
Closing time.
Drink up and let's go, folks.

108
00:08:02,477 --> 00:08:04,477
I have an observation for you.

109
00:08:06,214 --> 00:08:10,218
You wanna be an immortal composer,
you better learn how to play that thing.

110
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,380
You know, sometimes at work,

111
00:09:00,922 --> 00:09:03,656
I try to conjure up
what your face looks like.

112
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,577
Curve of your lips.

113
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:08,467
Way your hair falls.
How you smell.

114
00:09:10,038 --> 00:09:12,147
You see my face every day.

115
00:09:13,289 --> 00:09:14,791
Yeah, but not like this.

116
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,893
- You know, what we had...
- it was nothing.

117
00:09:21,965 --> 00:09:22,965
Nothing.

118
00:09:23,447 --> 00:09:25,218
You're a machine. I'm not.

119
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,066
Well, whatever I am,
I know how I felt.

120
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,902
Software doesn't have feelings.

121
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:35,782
How many of us ended up with the people
we really wanted to be with?

122
00:09:36,155 --> 00:09:38,368
Got stuck with the best
of limited options?

123
00:09:39,388 --> 00:09:40,388
And why?

124
00:09:41,031 --> 00:09:43,041
Because the ones we really wanted...

125
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:47,419
that we really loved
were dead, dying...

126
00:09:56,141 --> 00:09:57,471
I love you, Chief.

127
00:10:11,496 --> 00:10:13,008
Gods damn it.

128
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,094
Come on, people,

129
00:10:15,219 --> 00:10:17,658
you can't draw
your power from the same bus!

130
00:10:25,453 --> 00:10:27,578
- You said you had something for me.
- Come in.

131
00:10:33,644 --> 00:10:35,772
I got something
that'll cheer you up.

132
00:10:39,366 --> 00:10:40,366
Hey, Hera.

133
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,976
Whatcha drawing, stars?

134
00:10:46,383 --> 00:10:48,183
Those are very good stars.

135
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:51,784
Thank you.

136
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:57,547
Recognize any of this?

137
00:10:58,656 --> 00:10:59,956
That's my stuff.

138
00:11:01,957 --> 00:11:05,289
- When we all thought you were dead...
- The pilots auctioned it off, I know.

139
00:11:07,783 --> 00:11:09,293
Took me a while but I managed

140
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:11,741
to buy, beg, and steal them back.

141
00:11:22,133 --> 00:11:23,181
That for me?

142
00:11:25,325 --> 00:11:26,226
Thank you.

143
00:11:30,013 --> 00:11:31,013
Thank you.

144
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,027
What about the rest?

145
00:11:36,545 --> 00:11:37,545
Keep it.

146
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:26,079
<i>Thank God.</i>

147
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:31,083
<i>I don't know why i'm here.</i>

148
00:12:37,277 --> 00:12:39,527
<i>You know, when I shot the old man,</i>

149
00:12:40,942 --> 00:12:43,092
<i>the things that you said to me...</i>

150
00:12:44,429 --> 00:12:46,529
the way that you looked at me...

151
00:12:49,671 --> 00:12:52,821
<i>I thought New Caprica
was a way to set things right.</i>

152
00:12:53,244 --> 00:12:56,316
<i>You can't force people to love you
at the point of a gun.</i>

153
00:12:57,363 --> 00:12:58,663
<i>I know that now.</i>

154
00:13:00,615 --> 00:13:02,715
<i>But at the time I felt betrayed.</i>

155
00:13:04,122 --> 00:13:06,022
<i>So I wanted to forget you...</i>

156
00:13:07,472 --> 00:13:08,622
<i>and hate you.</i>

157
00:13:12,884 --> 00:13:13,984
<i>Didn't work.</i>

158
00:13:16,397 --> 00:13:20,401
<i>I've thought about you every day
since that moment I died in your arms.</i>

159
00:13:30,703 --> 00:13:31,703
<i>Me too.</i>

160
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:39,208
<i>If I had known back then
what I am...</i>

161
00:13:45,765 --> 00:13:46,765
<i>I know.</i>

162
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,620
<i>Galen, it's okay, really.</i>

163
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:55,450
<i>I mean, the most important thing
is that we both know who we are now.</i>

164
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:04,146
<i>Let's make the most
with the time that we have left.</i>

165
00:14:08,169 --> 00:14:09,169
<i>Please?</i>

166
00:14:42,645 --> 00:14:44,245
What the hell is this?

167
00:14:45,394 --> 00:14:46,394
Our house.

168
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:47,928
On Picon.

169
00:14:49,771 --> 00:14:53,266
It's the one that we planned to build
when we mustered out.

170
00:15:03,089 --> 00:15:04,089
Stop it.

171
00:15:06,498 --> 00:15:07,498
<i>Stop this.</i>

172
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:11,159
<i>I'm sorry, Galen.</i>

173
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:14,177
I thought you'd be okay
with Cylon projection.

174
00:15:40,376 --> 00:15:41,826
The critic returns.

175
00:15:42,096 --> 00:15:44,680
I thought I'd see
if you were making any progress.

176
00:15:44,805 --> 00:15:45,986
You tell me.

177
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,230
It's longer.

178
00:15:48,913 --> 00:15:49,906
Lotta notes.

179
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:52,867
- You hate it?
- I didn't say that.

180
00:15:54,624 --> 00:15:57,192
You were savagely honest with me
the other night.

181
00:15:57,317 --> 00:15:59,826
- Why be diplomatic now?
- I'm not being diplomatic,

182
00:15:59,951 --> 00:16:02,814
you oversensitive jackass.
I said I liked it.

183
00:16:03,475 --> 00:16:04,475
Really?

184
00:16:06,112 --> 00:16:07,112
Why?

185
00:16:12,531 --> 00:16:14,681
It's hard to put into words.

186
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,730
Made me think of...

187
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:20,066
someone chasing after a car.

188
00:16:21,007 --> 00:16:23,157
Not exactly what I was going for.

189
00:16:25,006 --> 00:16:27,738
I was trying to convey
a sense of loss.

190
00:16:29,918 --> 00:16:32,004
That's...
that's what I meant.

191
00:16:32,848 --> 00:16:35,118
It's like losing someone
that you care about.

192
00:16:36,106 --> 00:16:37,746
Their car pulls away. You...

193
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:40,631
You chase 'em.

194
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:43,121
But they're going too fast.

195
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,602
So that's it?

196
00:16:51,425 --> 00:16:53,605
We're just gonna sit on our hands?

197
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:56,307
- Let our people kill her for vengeance?
- What do you expect us to do?

198
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,475
Issue a formal decree of clemency?

199
00:16:59,108 --> 00:17:00,366
We can't interfere.

200
00:17:00,491 --> 00:17:02,395
We can't set ourselves up as Gods.

201
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,773
The rebels
are the aggrieved parties.

202
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:07,515
They have every right
to determine Valerii's...

203
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,943
- Can't!
- ... punishement.

204
00:17:09,765 --> 00:17:11,308
Boomer saved your life.

205
00:17:11,433 --> 00:17:13,490
You wouldn't even be here
if it wasn't for her.

206
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:17,118
And I will testify to that at her trial,
but I won't try to stop it.

207
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:20,288
We have
to let justice run its course.

208
00:17:22,044 --> 00:17:23,466
Then they will

209
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,302
kill her.

210
00:17:26,397 --> 00:17:27,741
Sure as hell.

211
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,982
We're all in hell.

212
00:17:33,725 --> 00:17:36,921
- Thanks for your input, Colonel.
- He just lost his child.

213
00:17:37,046 --> 00:17:38,348
You leave him be.

214
00:17:48,406 --> 00:17:49,975
<i>How long you been...</i>

215
00:17:50,518 --> 00:17:51,569
<i>Going there?</i>

216
00:17:54,043 --> 00:17:55,086
<i>A while.</i>

217
00:17:56,301 --> 00:17:58,197
Became my secret retreat.

218
00:17:59,606 --> 00:18:01,563
<i>A way of feeling close to you.</i>

219
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:06,207
Do you remember

220
00:18:07,467 --> 00:18:10,088
<i>how we obsessed
over every little detail?</i>

221
00:18:13,545 --> 00:18:14,511
<i>That was...</i>

222
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:16,186
<i>You...</i>

223
00:18:16,311 --> 00:18:17,992
<i>obsessing. I was just...</i>

224
00:18:19,467 --> 00:18:20,480
<i>Listening.</i>

225
00:18:21,094 --> 00:18:22,107
<i>Really?</i>

226
00:18:22,232 --> 00:18:23,768
<i>How many floor plans did you draw?</i>

227
00:18:25,782 --> 00:18:26,795
<i>That's...</i>

228
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,216
<i>being thorough.</i>

229
00:18:33,101 --> 00:18:34,738
We never had a chance to build it,

230
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:36,893
<i>so I built it in my head.</i>

231
00:18:37,542 --> 00:18:39,876
<i>And I wanted so much
to share it with you.</i>

232
00:18:56,791 --> 00:19:00,054
<i>Are you sure?
I don't want to put you through any...</i>

233
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,187
We've nailed the first movement.

234
00:20:50,954 --> 00:20:52,723
Now how about the second?

235
00:21:00,417 --> 00:21:04,260
It's okay, it's just the next hurdle.
The key is to, you know, not panic.

236
00:21:06,939 --> 00:21:09,493
Just trust yourself
something's gonna come.

237
00:21:11,448 --> 00:21:13,470
It's just part of the process.

238
00:21:17,052 --> 00:21:20,500
Is part of the process
also stealing from other composers?

239
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:24,574
That piece you're riffing off of,
it's Nomion's 3rd Sonata, 2nd movement.

240
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:30,323
I mean,
it's what it sounded like anyway.

241
00:21:30,812 --> 00:21:32,666
No you're dead on the money.

242
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,500
It's pronounced "no-mayan".

243
00:21:36,256 --> 00:21:37,663
Anyway, he's my touchstone.

244
00:21:37,788 --> 00:21:41,043
Whenever I come up dry,
I look to him for inspiration.

245
00:21:41,439 --> 00:21:44,469
And for somebody who hates music
so much, you know an awful lot about it.

246
00:21:46,874 --> 00:21:48,399
My dad used to play.

247
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,422
So what's the story?

248
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:57,070
He forced you to learn,
and he was such a perfectionist,

249
00:21:57,195 --> 00:21:58,511
you grew to hate it?

250
00:22:01,388 --> 00:22:03,653
No, I loved it... actually.

251
00:22:06,884 --> 00:22:09,873
He used to sit me next to him
on the bench when he played.

252
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:14,199
Smell of tobacco on his breath.

253
00:22:17,182 --> 00:22:18,711
He taught me a few songs.

254
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:21,733
I used to try
so hard to get 'em right.

255
00:22:22,154 --> 00:22:26,106
Not because I was afraid he'd get angry,
but because I knew he'd be so proud.

256
00:22:27,176 --> 00:22:29,076
There was this one song that

257
00:22:29,476 --> 00:22:30,630
he taught me.

258
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:34,990
It made me feel happy
and sad all at the same time.

259
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:39,273
The best ones do.

260
00:23:34,551 --> 00:23:37,832
How is it possible that I found my body
and I'm still here?

261
00:23:39,531 --> 00:23:40,795
I mean, what am I?

262
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,170
A ghost? A demon?

263
00:23:45,297 --> 00:23:47,134
You're asking the wrong guy.

264
00:23:47,437 --> 00:23:49,190
I'm just a piano player.

265
00:23:57,156 --> 00:23:59,651
When I was leading
the fleet to Earth,

266
00:23:59,776 --> 00:24:02,106
everything seemed so clear.

267
00:24:04,387 --> 00:24:06,392
For the first time in my life,

268
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:10,472
I knew what I was doing
and why I was here.

269
00:24:12,832 --> 00:24:14,619
Now I'm just adrift again.

270
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,018
Listen,

271
00:24:20,451 --> 00:24:22,170
you may feel like hell.

272
00:24:22,937 --> 00:24:25,684
But sometimes lost
is where you need to be.

273
00:24:26,763 --> 00:24:28,541
Just because
you don't know your direction

274
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:30,842
doesn't mean you don't have one.

275
00:24:37,189 --> 00:24:38,655
Madam President.

276
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,863
I'm asking you

277
00:24:41,428 --> 00:24:43,298
as a personal favor to me,

278
00:24:44,854 --> 00:24:45,978
don't sign that.

279
00:24:48,683 --> 00:24:50,191
Don't do that, Chief.

280
00:24:50,579 --> 00:24:54,031
Personal feelings are what
Sharon Valerii preys upon.

281
00:24:54,156 --> 00:24:55,076
You know that

282
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:58,803
better than any of us.
You need to clear your head.

283
00:25:04,772 --> 00:25:06,622
You don't have to kill her.

284
00:25:07,598 --> 00:25:09,091
Leave her in the brig.

285
00:25:10,111 --> 00:25:12,521
She is a danger in the brig,
out of the brig.

286
00:25:12,646 --> 00:25:14,649
A danger to us,
a danger to our Cylon allies.

287
00:25:14,774 --> 00:25:17,348
This can't be the last option,
Madam, please.

288
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:20,309
Madam President, please.

289
00:25:27,433 --> 00:25:28,715
We're done here,

290
00:25:30,038 --> 00:25:31,039
Chief.

291
00:25:44,647 --> 00:25:46,043
You're dismissed.

292
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:25,813
Somebody check the fuse.

293
00:26:44,562 --> 00:26:45,562
What?

294
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:48,272
- What, that was good.
- It's crap.

295
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:50,977
Maybe you need to take a break.

296
00:26:51,701 --> 00:26:53,236
Get yourself laid or something.

297
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:55,442
That might dissipate the tension.

298
00:26:57,063 --> 00:26:58,663
That why she left you?

299
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:01,578
That's a pretty deep groove
on your finger.

300
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,619
Had to have been there for a while.

301
00:27:05,676 --> 00:27:06,677
Too long.

302
00:27:07,439 --> 00:27:09,813
- She didn't leave me, I left her.
- Why?

303
00:27:13,317 --> 00:27:15,613
She wanted me to quit
playing the piano.

304
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,600
You left her for that?

305
00:27:19,752 --> 00:27:22,793
I was playing steady gigs.
Making decent money.

306
00:27:23,835 --> 00:27:25,365
Now that we had a kid,

307
00:27:26,046 --> 00:27:27,576
she said it wasn't enough.

308
00:27:28,219 --> 00:27:29,920
Said I had to get a real job.

309
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,567
I told her I might as well
cut my heart out.

310
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,477
My Gods, you're just like my father.

311
00:27:35,717 --> 00:27:38,617
You start a family,
the going gets tough, you ditch 'em.

312
00:27:38,742 --> 00:27:41,019
Did you ever stop thinking
about yourself long enough

313
00:27:41,144 --> 00:27:43,077
to consider
what you did to your kid?

314
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:54,463
<i>You got it. Thanks, Chief.</i>

315
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:58,197
<i>Every time the godsdamn power goes out,
we gotta go down and check the locks.</i>

316
00:27:59,748 --> 00:28:02,602
Prisoner's still secure.
She slept right through it.

317
00:28:04,945 --> 00:28:06,318
You gonna stay a while?

318
00:28:06,443 --> 00:28:08,664
Word is they're shipping her out
tomorrow.

319
00:28:10,753 --> 00:28:12,397
Said all I needed to say.

320
00:28:19,508 --> 00:28:21,922
So maybe what your old man did
was wrong.

321
00:28:23,194 --> 00:28:25,361
But he still left you
with something.

322
00:28:26,381 --> 00:28:28,462
He taught you how to play the piano.

323
00:28:29,672 --> 00:28:31,610
I never played after he left.

324
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:37,305
What about that song?
That song he taught you.

325
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:40,761
The one that makes you happy and sad
at the same time. Play that for me.

326
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:44,195
I don't frakking remember it.
And even if I did, I wouldn't.

327
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,710
That son-of-a-bitch never came back.

328
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,685
He never called. He never wrote.

329
00:28:50,489 --> 00:28:52,921
So you quit playing to punish him?

330
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,194
Come on, play me a song.

331
00:28:58,684 --> 00:29:00,097
It won't hurt. Come on.

332
00:29:02,726 --> 00:29:04,333
I'll show you. It's easy.

333
00:29:04,711 --> 00:29:05,712
Come on.

334
00:29:06,194 --> 00:29:07,784
Don't make me hurt you.

335
00:29:07,909 --> 00:29:08,934
Here we go.

336
00:29:12,012 --> 00:29:13,277
That goes there.

337
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,146
And that goes there.

338
00:29:24,592 --> 00:29:25,613
Go ahead.

339
00:29:43,725 --> 00:29:44,784
It's okay.

340
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,770
- It's okay.
- You play, please.

341
00:29:53,847 --> 00:29:54,943
I'll play.

342
00:29:56,022 --> 00:29:57,515
I'll play if you play.

343
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:08,889
Great.

344
00:30:09,192 --> 00:30:11,753
I hope you're here
to fix the frakking shower.

345
00:30:12,892 --> 00:30:13,892
Boomer.

346
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,411
Athena.

347
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:33,159
Helo.

348
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:38,141
- I didn't think...
- You didn't think I'd let you go

349
00:30:38,266 --> 00:30:41,448
on a six-day mission in deep space
without a proper goodbye, did you?

350
00:30:42,112 --> 00:30:44,701
Next flight team's not suiting up
for another 20.

351
00:30:46,787 --> 00:30:47,993
You smell good.

352
00:30:48,277 --> 00:30:50,110
I made a trade for some real soap.

353
00:30:55,052 --> 00:30:56,520
Taste as good as it smells?

354
00:31:02,062 --> 00:31:03,593
Something wrong?

355
00:31:14,413 --> 00:31:17,525
Cottle was right. I never should have
insisted on seeing him.

356
00:31:18,017 --> 00:31:19,168
His eyes were open.

357
00:31:19,706 --> 00:31:21,256
I wasn't ready for that.

358
00:31:22,083 --> 00:31:24,385
Little guy was looking right at me.

359
00:32:57,656 --> 00:33:00,026
It's all right, I think...
I think you almost had it.

360
00:33:00,151 --> 00:33:01,606
Something's missing.

361
00:33:03,811 --> 00:33:05,172
It's the left hand.

362
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,651
I'll play down here.

363
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:10,570
I think I know what you're doing.
Now hang on.

364
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:25,197
Holy crap.

365
00:33:46,104 --> 00:33:47,254
That's right.

366
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:01,315
Play the bottom, okay?
Come in when you think you're ready.

367
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:16,887
Hey, baby.

368
00:34:20,276 --> 00:34:21,276
Hi.

369
00:34:23,831 --> 00:34:25,611
Guess what mommy brought you?

370
00:34:26,027 --> 00:34:28,411
Drink it all, yeah. Good, right?

371
00:34:31,008 --> 00:34:33,278
We forgot
all about her physical today.

372
00:34:50,274 --> 00:34:52,085
Let me give you a hand with that.

373
00:34:57,434 --> 00:34:58,749
Easy, easy, Chief.

374
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:05,019
Thanks.

375
00:35:36,837 --> 00:35:38,216
What the frak?

376
00:35:40,484 --> 00:35:41,847
That's the song.

377
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:16,006
- Where'd you learn to play that song?
- I played it as a kid.

378
00:36:16,394 --> 00:36:17,422
My father...

379
00:36:17,547 --> 00:36:19,153
What are you talking about?

380
00:36:20,092 --> 00:36:21,263
Who did this?

381
00:36:25,522 --> 00:36:26,655
Come with me.

382
00:36:29,279 --> 00:36:30,729
I can't do it without you.

383
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:40,664
Yeah, you can.

384
00:36:42,592 --> 00:36:43,857
We'll meet again.

385
00:36:47,878 --> 00:36:49,747
There's something
I want you to remember.

386
00:36:52,846 --> 00:36:54,677
All the things that I said...

387
00:36:55,697 --> 00:36:56,697
about us.

388
00:36:57,577 --> 00:36:59,090
I meant them with all my heart.

389
00:37:01,283 --> 00:37:03,202
So no matter what happens...

390
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,847
He fired
before he acquired the target,

391
00:37:30,972 --> 00:37:32,957
gave away his position,
that was the end of him.

392
00:37:33,127 --> 00:37:34,661
So don't let this happen to you.

393
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:36,893
During this exercise,
we could have 6 or 8 ships

394
00:37:37,018 --> 00:37:38,738
hitting the merge
where the fight starts.

395
00:37:38,863 --> 00:37:41,773
So keep your head on a swivel,
especially in the vertical.

396
00:37:44,114 --> 00:37:45,470
Oh, my Gods, Athena.

397
00:37:50,975 --> 00:37:53,186
In the locker room. It was Boomer.

398
00:37:53,808 --> 00:37:55,169
Did she get Hera?

399
00:37:56,364 --> 00:37:58,191
Six, get a med team here
right frakking now.

400
00:37:58,575 --> 00:38:01,653
K-ro, get on the horn to CIC
and let 'em know Boomer's loose.

401
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,346
She's got my frakking kid!

402
00:38:19,704 --> 00:38:22,293
LSO, Athena, what's the delay
with my flight clearance?

403
00:38:22,418 --> 00:38:23,816
<i>Please hold, Raptor 719.</i>

404
00:38:23,941 --> 00:38:26,163
<i>We're still waiting
for traffic to clear your flight path.</i>

405
00:38:26,288 --> 00:38:27,638
<i>Stand by for instructions.</i>

406
00:38:32,608 --> 00:38:33,608
Come on.

407
00:38:37,608 --> 00:38:39,733
She's not buying it, sir.
She initiated prestart.

408
00:38:41,234 --> 00:38:42,884
Boomer, this is Galactica actual.

409
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,565
<i>Return to checkers red
and shut down.</i>

410
00:38:46,037 --> 00:38:47,039
Copy.

411
00:38:56,295 --> 00:38:57,297
Hoshi.

412
00:38:57,933 --> 00:38:59,628
Vector the CAP to intercept.

413
00:39:00,172 --> 00:39:02,839
Blue leader, Galactica. Immediate.
Proceed directly to Galactica.

414
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:05,276
Engage Raptor two-one-niner.

415
00:39:05,799 --> 00:39:06,913
<i>Weapons free.</i>

416
00:39:07,527 --> 00:39:09,280
<i>Blue flight, rolling in hot.</i>

417
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:12,307
If you launch, Boomer,

418
00:39:12,695 --> 00:39:14,245
<i>I will shoot you down.</i>

419
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:17,354
I don't think you wanna do that
while I have Hera on board.

420
00:39:21,673 --> 00:39:23,317
We can't let her get off this ship.

421
00:39:23,676 --> 00:39:25,028
Retract the flight pods.

422
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:30,326
Sir, she's spooling to jump.

423
00:39:31,301 --> 00:39:33,117
If she jumps inside the ship,

424
00:39:33,242 --> 00:39:36,456
the spatial disruption
could tear Galactica's guts out.

425
00:39:37,178 --> 00:39:38,732
Retract the flight pods.

426
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:41,952
Retract flight pods.
I say again, retract flight pods.

427
00:40:17,909 --> 00:40:19,062
Don't do it.

428
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:21,209
<i>Don't do it, don't do it!</i>

429
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,940
Frak!

430
00:40:43,743 --> 00:40:44,743
Hera.

431
00:41:20,432 --> 00:41:22,435
I need a team, scaffolding,

432
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,896
shoring compound
to the forward magazine right away!

433
00:41:25,021 --> 00:41:26,483
<i>One Eight looks like another.</i>

434
00:41:26,608 --> 00:41:29,037
<i>How did a three-year old girl
get by you, though?</i>

435
00:41:29,162 --> 00:41:32,137
- The hell's going on up there?
- Boomer took her kid.

436
00:41:33,606 --> 00:41:34,407
What?

437
00:41:34,532 --> 00:41:36,665
She took Hera
and just walked out of the daycare.

438
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:39,499
<i>How do you let a three-year old girl
climb into a Raptor?</i>

439
00:41:39,624 --> 00:41:40,937
<i>How did she get by you?</i>

440
00:41:41,062 --> 00:41:43,124
<i>I'm sorry, sir,
but nobody saw your daughter.</i>

441
00:41:43,249 --> 00:41:45,185
<i>That's impossible!
Somebody saw her!</i>

442
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:48,299
<i>She's a three-year old child.
Explain to me how she gets by...</i>

443
00:41:48,436 --> 00:41:50,422
Had to be orchestrated
from the beginning.

444
00:41:51,134 --> 00:41:52,374
My escape, all of it.

445
00:41:52,499 --> 00:41:54,903
I was just a means
to get Boomer here.

446
00:41:55,811 --> 00:41:57,211
Cavil wanted Hera.

447
00:41:57,919 --> 00:41:59,525
Boomer got her for him.

448
00:42:00,966 --> 00:42:03,076
How can a three-year old girl

449
00:42:03,201 --> 00:42:05,502
spontaneously write down that song?

450
00:42:06,438 --> 00:42:09,623
She's plugged into something
that's manipulating all of us.

451
00:42:11,731 --> 00:42:14,074
Maybe Anders could help us.

452
00:42:16,377 --> 00:42:17,877
If he ever wakes up.
