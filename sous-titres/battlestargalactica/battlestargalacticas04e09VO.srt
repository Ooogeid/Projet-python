00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,970
TWELVE CYLON MODELS

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,330
SEVEN ARE KNOWN

3
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:14,280
FOUR LIVE IN SECRET

4
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,750
ONE WILL BE REVEALED

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,180
Previously on battlestar galactica.

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,650
the threes,the d'annas.

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,030
They were boxed after the battle on the algae planet.

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,140
why?

9
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,200
d'anna saw the faces of the final five.

10
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:34,210
But if we unbox her,she can reveal their identities to us.

11
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,110
the final five have been to earth.

12
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,370
If we help find them,they can help us get there.

13
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,960
so what could possibly motivate us to trust you now?

14
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:45,180
The boxing facility resides within the cylon resurrection hub.

15
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,380
This hub controls the functions of every resurrection ship.

16
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:53,100
You destroy the hub,cylons lose their ability to download.

17
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,390
the hybrid on the baseship spoke of an opera house and a dying leader.

18
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,500
We're going to talk to the hybrid.

19
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,780
And why would you require my presence?

20
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,820
Because you're in my visions.

21
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,370
president roslin was apparently aboard the cylon baseship,

22
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,480
along with gaius baltar and many of galactica's pilots when it jumped away.

23
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:14,630
Hub's gone.

24
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,400
We're getting radiation signatures from multiple nukes.

25
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:18,920
Baseship fragments.

26
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,560
The president's baseship was destroyed.

27
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,550
It's a different baseship.

28
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,650
waiting alone in a raptor as the rest of the fleet jump away,

29
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,850
well,that sounds a lot like suicide,dad.

30
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,480
Why are you doing this?

31
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,950
because I can't live without her.

32
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,280
TWO DAYS AGO

33
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,710
Plug it in.

34
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,270
I need to talk to it.

35
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,830
- Let god's will be done.
- Shut up.

36
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,390
It's time to get some answers.

37
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,190
Jump!

38
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,000
Elosha.

39
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,270
Oh,my gods.

40
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,720
filters.

41
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,250
- filters the sublime elevation.
- why did it jump?

42
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,040
Where are we?

43
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,250
- I'm more concerned about why we're here.
- Control.

44
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,430
filters.

45
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,650
why don't I talk to the hybrid?

46
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,390
Find out why.

47
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,050
She can just do that.

48
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,380
- She can just... 
- jump!

49
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,250
Will you walk with me?

50
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,000
Galactica.

51
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,070
It...what's going on?

52
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,800
- It's empty.
- It is...

53
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,750
Feels bigger this way,doesn't it?

54
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,210
It's so quiet.

55
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,860
It's strange.

56
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,850
A lot of things are strange.

IN SEARCH OF A HOME

Battlestar Galactica
Season4 Episode09

63
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,800
wing beats of a dove drown out the heartbeats of those who follow.

64
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,120
Six is back in the stream.

65
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,190
That's unusual.

66
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,590
To jump again so quickly.

67
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,410
What do you think it means?

68
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,050
Look,it knows me.

69
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,890
It trusts me.

70
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,290
I think.

71
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:02,170
I think it even likes me,'cause I...

72
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:05,100
you're getting information from this liquid?

73
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,800
The hybrid is disorganized.It's panicking.

74
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:09,830
I don't know why.

75
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,270
Tell me.

76
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,670
Why are you jumping the ship?

77
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,180
The six.

78
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,450
The six who went among the makers is no longer.

79
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,990
End of line.

80
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,080
Back in the stream that feeds the ocean that feeds the stream.

81
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,020
the six.

82
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:27,450
She means natalie,the six who was our leader.

83
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,850
She's either been hurt or killed back on galactica.

84
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,900
That's why the hybrid's panicking.

85
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,510
So she's upset.

86
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,300
Okay,fine.

87
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,400
Can you.

88
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:41,030
calm her down?Can you tell her to jump back?

89
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,650
It doesn't work like that.

90
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,870
She makes her own decisions.

91
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:48,920
And we can't unplug her because now she's wired herself into life support.

92
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:52,350
All right,then why don't we give this a go?

93
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,780
Hey.

94
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,270
Hey,stop jumping the ship,all right?

95
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,900
Calm your mind.

96
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,000
Cease countdown,cease countdown.

97
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:09,160
Circulation,ventilation,control.

98
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,420
Filters.

99
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:13,190
- filters.the sublime elevation 
- did you see that?

100
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,900
I just opened myself up to it 

101
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,600
- on a spiritual level...
- jump!

102
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,940
Don't you just hate these people?

103
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,990
no.

104
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:42,960
Oh,but you don't love them either.

105
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,030
The people in this room are the closest thing you've got to family,and you.

106
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:51,310
you've been their president.

107
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:58,230
Watch them try to comfort each other.

108
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:01,360
At least you haven't taken that away from them.

109
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,060
yet.

110
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,560
You didn't rob them of their empathy.

111
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,430
yet.

112
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:11,280
You just don't make room for people anymore.

113
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:15,520
You don't love people.

114
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,140
Is that clear enough?

115
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:21,610
Practical enough for you,madam president?

116
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,760
I think we're going towards the resurrection hub.

117
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,020
I think the mission is still on.

118
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,820
You sure there's no eta at the hub?

119
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,750
No,the hub is jumping and our hybrid's jumping after it.

120
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,180
Sometimes we're showing up six hours after it's moved on.

121
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,420
Sometimes,like,six minutes.

122
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,080
And one time it'll be within one jump-length and we'll catch it.

123
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,360
Yeah,but we don't know when.

124
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:01,640
So we'll have to assume that any jump could be the one that just drops us in next to it.

125
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:08,580
They're gonna read our heat signatures the second we fire up the first viper.

126
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,490
Hell,they'll read our electronics.

127
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:15,290
Yeah,if we could only mask that.

128
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,780
Go in cold.

129
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,480
No electronics at all.

130
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:26,810
We'll send the vipers out dead,towed by cylon birds.

131
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,970
They'll never see it coming.

132
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:31,370
Take out the hub's jump drive,then settle in for the long fight.

133
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,300
Yeah,good,okay,okay.

134
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:35,880
But you and me,we've got to get onto the hub

135
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:41,150
in the middle of that mess and try to find d'anna.

136
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,410
We can do this.

137
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,770
No,I-I don't know.

138
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,790
It's crazy,isn't it?

139
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,850
We're putting ourselves right where the action is.

140
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,720
It's not a great plan.

141
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,760
There's no time.

142
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,580
Hey,let me help you.

143
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:22,840
Athena,my wife,she learned to do that.

144
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:25,570
She never did that when I met her.

145
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,330
What?

146
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,300
I got curious about athena.

147
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,700
About her and hera and you.

148
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,960
So I accessed her.

149
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:44,170
her memories from her last download.

150
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:47,760
You have her memories.

151
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,860
Yeah,and they're mine now too.

152
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:55,390
They're as real as my own.

153
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,480
I know this must feel like a violation of trust or something,

154
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:03,880
but I don't... I don't want it to be strange,okay?

155
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:04,970
Right.

156
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,660
Right,sure.

157
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,950
Madam president?

158
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,250
Sir?

159
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,750
Hope I didn't wake you.

160
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,950
Uh,come in.

161
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,940
Thank you for the use of your...your raptor.

162
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:44,020
I needed some familiar surroundings.

163
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,670
Don't worry.I'll give it back to lt.

164
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,680
Pike the second you need it.

165
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,640
About that.

166
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:54,220
This mission,it's very risky.

167
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,740
If there's even a chance that we can go in and blow up

168
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,120
that hub and end cylon resurrection for all cylons forever,

169
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:05,640
we must take it.

170
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:09,310
I cannot back away from that.

171
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,270
Yes,sir.

172
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:18,220
If and when d'anna comes back from the dead,bring her to me.

173
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:24,840
I think the cylons think that she'll be interrogated by both groups together.

174
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,050
I'm sure they do.

175
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,620
Bring her to me.

176
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:33,770
She knows the identities of the five cylons in our fleet.

177
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:36,320
It is a matter now of human security,

178
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:41,250
and I will not let the cylons have audience to that discussion.

179
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,370
I want to talk to her alone.

180
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,870
Yes,sir.

181
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:49,540
Good.

182
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,230
RESURRECTION HUB

183
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,520
welcome home,d'anna.

184
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,910
You told me I'd never have to go through this again.

185
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:16,290
I lied.

186
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:21,780
You thought you were putting me away forever.

187
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:24,220
So what changed?

188
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,600
War.

189
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:28,330
A genuine cylon civil war.

190
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:32,660
Ones and fours and fives against twos and sixes and eights 

191
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,970
that objected to your retirement.

192
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:40,120
Now your supporters are working with humans against all the rest of us.

193
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,360
All in your name.

194
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,990
Boomer's an eight.

195
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:54,540
Shouldn't she be on the other side?

196
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,130
Boomer's my pet eight.

197
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,420
She's seen the light of reason.

198
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,290
And an eight can make a passionate ally.

199
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:08,350
Till she sees something shiny.

200
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,730
Why'd you bring me back anyway?

201
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:19,400
I brought you back to heal us,sister,and end this shameful war.

202
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,610
Since cylon pilots don't use call signs,

203
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,970
we're gonna be painting unique identifiers on all their birds.

204
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,360
That's a relief.

205
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,490
you address them,use that number,okay?

206
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,020
Should've scrubbed this frakkin' mission.

207
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,160
Hey,everyone,listen up.

208
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,440
Now these heavy raiders aren't like the other raiders.

209
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,340
They aren't gonna make any hinky moves on their own.

210
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,470
They're under the control of their pilots.

211
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,560
The cylon pilots are in charge of their birds.

212
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,490
Oh,now there are tiny pilots inside of them?

213
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,820
We do our jobs.

214
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,840
Training is just as good as yours.

215
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,420
oh,yeah?

216
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:57,310
Twenty-some of you I've taken out weren't that good.

217
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,820
redwing.

218
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,810
Redwing!

219
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,680
Now let's talk about the surprise element.

220
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:09,120
First wave of vipers are gonna ride in,engines cold,dradis and comm off,okay?

221
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,120
You're gonna come in towed by cables from the heavy raiders.

222
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,360
- We're rigging 'em up now.
- Captain,don't... 

223
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:17,180
now,I mean,if they're all tied together here,

224
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,960
kissing their gasholes so to speak,

225
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:20,170
and they tap on the brakes,

226
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,080
we're gonna smash right in the back of them.

227
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:23,090
They won'T.

228
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,810
It'll work,you guys.Really.

229
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,530
When you're close enough,the cable's gonna disconnect.

230
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,520
We're mounting small explosive charges to cut it.

231
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:30,950
Hold it,hold it.

232
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,710
We cut the cable,right?

233
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:34,490
Cylon pilots cut the cable.

234
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,310
Then you sling out of their birds and you turn your power on.

235
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:40,430
You're gonna be gunning directly at the hub's ftl.

236
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:42,550
Then it's an all-out fight until we can get in there with the nukes.

237
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,560
Yeah,so if the cylons don't lift up,and then we're toast,right?

238
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,790
No,look,I'm serious.

239
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:50,350
Hey,hey!

240
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,570
Pilots!

241
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,270
You've flown with cylons.

242
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,040
You've flown with athena.

243
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:57,700
You put your life in her hands and she hasn't betrayed you.

244
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,670
Well,I am the same as her.

245
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:07,490
Now all of these cylons here,all of these people,they're pilots like you.

246
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:11,490
And they're gonna be out in the soup with you taking out other cylons,

247
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:15,200
just like athena does every time she's asked to.

248
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:23,190
And when that hub is taken out,all of their lives will be at risk.

249
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,720
Just like yours.

250
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,970
So you might want to think about how you're gonna work together.

251
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,620
Because we're all dead if you don'T.

252
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,380
moving on.

253
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,750
just go and ask it already.

254
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,200
I've been told that you said something about an opera house,

255
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,020
- and I...
- because it seems pointless.

256
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,530
Look,there was an opera house.

257
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,520
An opera house.

258
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:48,670
Are you listening to me?

259
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,840
Apparently I was in the opera house.

260
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:51,940
I had a vision.

261
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,830
I was chasing after a little girl.

262
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,100
I came to a door.

263
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:59,610
I saw dr.Baltar and the six take the child.

264
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:01,880
She's not listening.

265
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:02,970
"Protect the child.

266
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,690
" She said,"protect the child.

267
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:05,660
" That's what caprica said.

268
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,590
You told me I was the one holding the child,

269
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:10,360
so obviously I was the one protecting the child,wasn't I?

270
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,010
- In the opera house... 
- no,no,no.

271
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,330
It wasn't at all clear what you were doing.

272
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,050
Let me listen.

273
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,260
Booting up.

274
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,680
I mean,obviously you've done this a thousand times before.

275
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:21,520
Well,I'm just doing the same thing you're doing.

276
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,810
No,you're not actually.

277
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,460
No,you're not.

278
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,660
Because if you'll watch what I'm doing,

279
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:27,890
what I'm doing is I'm actually focusing on her,all right?

280
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,770
Now tell us what happened in the opera house now,all right?

281
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:33,090
Oh,the only thing you're doing is yelling.

282
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,660
Such a format will close the doors.

283
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,720
Close the door.No,no,open the door.Open the door.

284
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,370
I want to open the door!

285
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,720
Do it again,do it again,do it again!

286
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:41,330
I'm going for a walk.

287
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,450
Love to see you do any better.

288
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,260
All right,I'll do it.

289
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,230
Open the door!

290
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,680
Three!

291
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,160
The three is online.

292
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,210
The three is online.

293
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,110
The three is online.

294
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:49,780
The three is online.

295
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,940
- Accessing data.
- The three is d'anna.

296
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:51,600
Loading data.

297
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:52,910
D'anna is online.

298
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,600
Oh,d'anna's in a body.

299
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:55,560
D'anna's back in a body.

300
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,060
Booting up...jump!

301
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,750
why are we doing this again?

302
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,330
I don't want to see this again.

303
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:19,430
The ancients used to say "a people is only as strong as the body of its leader."

304
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:26,450
If I follow that thought,are you saying that humanity died because I died?

305
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:32,100
If you're my subconscious,I've gotta say you're a little full of myself.

306
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:35,010
Humanity didn't die because you did.

307
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:37,050
The ancients,they got a lot of things wrong.

308
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,020
The body of a people is not the same as the body of its leader.

309
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:42,200
But the soul and the spirit might be.

310
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,950
Oh,I see,so you're only laying morality at my feet.

311
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,910
Well,that's okay.

312
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,950
I can take that.

313
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,330
I mean,there are a lot of people who have sins far greater than mine.

314
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,970
You're thinking of gaius baltar.

315
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:58,910
"then I dug "into the stump and pulled rocks from the ground "until my fingers bled. "

316
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:02,330
I collected seeds from the few fruits "the island offered,"

317
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:07,440
and planted them in long,straight furrows,"like the ranks of soldiers.

318
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:09,630
"When I finished,I looked at what I had done."

319
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,350
I did not see a garden.

320
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,740
I saw a scar.

321
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:18,650
"This island had saved my life,and I had done it no service."

322
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:38,100
I can see a real hierarchy around here.

323
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,140
And I have to tell you,you're on the lower end of the scale,my friend.

324
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,010
Yes,you are.

325
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:48,220
Which is odd when you think about the cylon god... 

326
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,590
they told you about god,didn't they?

327
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:03,620
I'm not even really sure if the hybrid was referring to d'anna,but if it's true.

328
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,340
it certainly would make it easier.

329
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:06,710
How so?

330
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,100
Well,we.

331
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,350
wouldn't have to find A.

332
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,480
find a body.

333
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,620
Yes,good.

334
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,580
Okay.

335
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,450
Go get her and bring her here.

336
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,510
Something else?

337
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:31,360
It's just once you have what she knows,

338
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:34,110
I can't help feeling like you could try to keep earth for humans only.

339
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:37,730
And I just... madam president,that doesn't seem... 

340
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,680
what?

341
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,660
Honest.

342
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,910
You're supposed to be conducting a fair deal here,

343
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,020
and instead you're taking d'anna off by yourself.

344
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,280
Taking what she knows.

345
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:48,690
Slow down,captain.

346
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:53,810
At best,d'anna knows conoce the identities of the cylons in our fleet.

347
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:58,450
And at best,they know a way to earth.

348
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,080
So you're not denying you'd keep the way to earth to yourself if you could.

349
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,100
I'm not saying that's true.

350
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:12,100
I will say that if the cylons had the option,that's exactly,exactly what they would do.

351
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,940
No,I don't think so.

352
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:20,470
Not the sharons,the eights.

353
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:22,600
Captain.

354
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:26,940
you are not married to the entire production line.

355
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:30,680
I cannot afford to be sentimental right now,

356
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,700
and I cannot afford you to be sentimental either.

357
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:38,870
If you can't do this job,find me someone who can.

358
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,630
What is that?

359
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,090
I think we're there.

360
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,960
Something's going on.

361
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,320
Another baseship,unscheduled.

362
00:20:55,390 --> 00:21:00,400
You've gotta speak to the twos and sixes and eights and tell them they've gone too far.

363
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,640
No.

364
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:04,980
Why don't you ask about the final five?

365
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,500
You never ask about them.

366
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:09,150
That's because I don't believe we're meant to know them.

367
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,790
Well,I'll tell you.

368
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:11,950
I will tell you.

369
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:14,740
I'll start shouting out their names.

370
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,650
Why do you risk it?

371
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,820
Are you going to help end this war or are you useless?

372
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:24,790
25 heavy raiders just launched from the new arrival,heading our way.

373
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:32,720
Come on,let's get this carpool started.

374
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,930
Now!

375
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:50,930
Cut the frakkin' cable now,you frakkin' bastard!

376
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,850
Oh,the inhibition's been lifted.

377
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:10,550
Oh,I sense it.

378
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:12,520
It's the rebel baseship.

379
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,150
I think they're gonna attack.

380
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,520
They're gonna blow the hub.

381
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,780
That would be mass murder.

382
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,280
Death would be permanent for all of us.

383
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,250
They've gone insane.

384
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:25,300
Permanent death?

385
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,410
Well,that makes this all the more meaningful.

386
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,720
Helo,we've blown their ftl.

387
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,240
That hub's not going anywhere.

388
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,410
Okay,take us down.

389
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,900
Well,he's your god as well.

390
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:17,440
And god doesn't want any of his creations to be.

391
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:19,360
slaves.

392
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:24,180
Not that you're a slave.

393
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,450
exactly.

394
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:47,320
Go.

395
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:10,930
This place is gonna go.

396
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:11,760
Grab her.

397
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,740
Run!

398
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,800
Hardball,pike.I'm hit.

399
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:27,020
My attitude control is down,and I can't even program any frakkin' ordnance.

400
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,420
Pike,hardball.

401
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,620
Man,don't jump.

402
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,900
You'll never make it to galactica.

403
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,540
You know how many jumps that is?

404
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:34,310
I'm out of here.

405
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:36,200
Okay,I'm jumping back home.

406
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,340
Karl.

407
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,620
come on,let's go.

408
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,170
Go!

409
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:27,610
there was this dog,see,and the master had placed a bit of food on the edge of its snout.

410
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:31,160
And the dog had to wait until he was told he could eat it.

411
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:37,170
I know.Pathetic.Pathetic,isn't it?

412
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:44,000
Put him over there.

413
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,180
Wait.

414
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,000
Easy,smith.Easy,easy.

415
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,180
Okay.

416
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,970
Find out what's going on!

417
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:56,190
Yes,sir.

418
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,850
- Thank you.
- Okay.

419
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,150
- Thank you,thank you.
- Good.

420
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,630
Okay,wait.

421
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:14,720
Okay.

422
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,600
Sorry.

423
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:26,140
You have this...you have this big hole in your hide,as cottle would say.

424
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,430
Okay.

425
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,360
All right.

426
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,500
I'm gonna do this again.

427
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,820
Thank you.

428
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,370
It's the least I can do.

429
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:36,090
I think you're gonna live.

430
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:36,890
as usual.

431
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,430
You know something?

432
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,360
What?

433
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,210
You're very pretty.

434
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,980
Man,that morpha worked fast.

435
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,330
Still.

436
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,540
Do you know why I'm so serene right now?

437
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,460
You're doped out of your mind?

438
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,580
Because I know god.

439
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:01,350
You need god,laura.

440
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,700
Really,you'd be a different woman.

441
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,690
I know god.

442
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,330
Therefore,I know myself.

443
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:11,880
Truth is.

444
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:18,240
I was harboring the most awful,desperate guilt.

445
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,890
A heavy,dark.

446
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:23,510
unimaginable.

447
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:27,170
soul-breaking guilt.

448
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,130
Now it's gone.

449
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,610
Now it's gone,it'S.

450
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,680
been transformed into... 

451
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,060
I have been transformed.

452
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,110
What was your guilt about?

453
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:48,150
I have no guilt.

454
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:52,290
What was your guilt about?

455
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,020
I gave the access codes to the cylons.

456
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,730
They wiped out most of humanity.

457
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:13,850
Of course,I didn't know that's what I was doing at the time exactly,

458
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,260
but that's what I did.

459
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:20,740
And when I realized what I had done,the magnitude.

460
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:24,330
in that moment,I was saved.

461
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,900
I was loved.

462
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,710
by god.

463
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,330
Looking back.

464
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:36,150
I think I was rewarded.

465
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,650
Rewarded.

466
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:47,050
Pythia talks about the flood that wiped out most of humanity.

467
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:49,850
Nobody blames the flood.

468
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:53,040
A flood is a force of nature.

469
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,390
Through the flood,mankind is rejuvenated,born again.

470
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:04,250
I was another flood,you see.

471
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,450
I blamed myself.

472
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,780
I blamed myself.

473
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:13,490
But god made the man that made that choice.

474
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:18,000
God made us all perfect.

475
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:25,280
And in that thought,all my guilt flies away.

476
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,680
flies away like a bird.

477
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:34,520
I can give you that peace,laura,that freedom.

478
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:38,250
Pray with me.

479
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,270
Pray with me.

480
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,960
Okay.

481
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:44,340
Thank you.

482
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:46,960
Okay.

483
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:18,490
What are you doing?

484
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,140
What are you doing?

485
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,550
It's all right.

486
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,740
You're fine.

487
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,990
Don't do this to me.

488
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,330
Don't do this to me,please.

489
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,870
We have d'anna on board.

490
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,530
We are clear of the hub.

491
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:54,290
Commence nuclear strike.

492
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,720
Repeat,nuclear strike is a go.

493
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:32,220
And with a whimper,every cylon in the universe begins to die.

494
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:35,020
yes,that's right.

495
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:37,500
And it's a good thing,d'anna.

496
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,290
Na because now there's no difference.

497
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,690
We can all start trusting each other.

498
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,270
Don't do this to me.

499
00:32:57,190 --> 00:33:01,460
Don't...don't do this to me.

500
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:04,770
Don't do this to me,please.

501
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,490
Please.

502
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,790
No.

503
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:23,580
I'm not saying baltar's done more good than harm in the universe.

504
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,790
He hasn'T.

505
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:29,300
The thing is,the harder it is to recognize someone's right to draw breath,

506
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:31,810
the more crucial it is.

507
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:35,000
If humanity is going to prove itself worthy of surviving,

508
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:39,830
it can't do it on a case-by-case basis.

509
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,600
A bad man feels his death just as keenly as a good man.

510
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:47,900
what do you want from me here?

511
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:49,640
Laura.

512
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:52,380
Just love someone.

513
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:56,090
Love.

514
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:18,960
You go.

515
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:23,330
You go.

516
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,320
You go to your rest now.

517
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:33,060
I'm not gonna be selfish anymore.

518
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,950
You go.

519
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,870
Rest.

520
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,610
No.

521
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:30,430
No,please,no.

522
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,260
Stop bleeding.

523
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,580
Stop the bleeding,stop the bleeding.

524
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,660
Okay,good.

525
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:48,980
Don't go.

526
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:51,590
All right,we've gotta get d'anna to the control room.

527
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,430
Nano,that's not the plan.

528
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:55,600
What?

529
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,080
What plan?

530
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,230
Interesting.

531
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:06,030
Please don't go,gaius.

532
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,920
Please.

533
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,250
I don't know how... all right,put it in.

534
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,380
I have to take her directly to the president.

535
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,190
No one else.

536
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,250
That wasn't the deal.

537
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:21,520
I'm just doing what she told me to do,okay?

538
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,600
double dealing.

539
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,540
It's very human.

540
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:27,010
You never got that,eight.

541
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,020
No more.

542
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,820
No more,don't go.

543
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:36,150
Please don't die.

544
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:44,530
Live,please.Don't go.

545
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:50,530
I'm not saying I agree.

546
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,940
I'm saying it's my orders.

547
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:01,020
So I pretty much just made a prize fool of myself,didn't I?

548
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,030
Trust.

549
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:09,340
can we go find the president now?

550
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,440
Gaius?

551
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:40,100
Gaius,it's me.

552
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,970
The hub's been destroyed.

553
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:48,230
Good.

554
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,450
Don't let anyone in here.

555
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,660
Whatever it takes.

556
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:58,240
Thank you.

557
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:03,220
He's injured,but I think he's going to survive.

558
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:09,150
I think it's gonna be a long time jumping back.

559
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,940
I've got time.

560
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:16,640
Is that right?

561
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:19,580
Well,you went to a lot of trouble to bring me here.

562
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,390
Deceiving your so-called allies.

563
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:28,620
I suppose you've got some questions for me.

564
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:29,660
Yes,I do.

565
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:35,020
I'd like to talk about the five cylons in my fleet.

566
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,990
So you know about the final five.

567
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:41,890
I know they're supposed to know the way to earth.

568
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:45,880
But you don't know that you're one of them?

569
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,420
Your face!

570
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,140
Oh,it's ridiculous!

571
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:01,420
No,look,I'm not giving you any names.

572
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:04,120
Not until I feel like I'm safe.

573
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:07,640
'Cause information is all I got,sweetie.

574
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:11,070
I'm mortal now.

575
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:15,750
In fact,I'm the only three in the whole darn universe.

576
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:19,130
So I gotta worry about protecting myself.

577
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:26,080
I'll tell you who the final five are when you take me back to your fleet.

578
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:29,770
Oh,and by the way,laura,I would've said the same thing

579
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:32,470
if you'd have met me with a whole lot of cylons,

580
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,350
'cause I don't trust anyone right now.

581
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:41,790
So all this deception,complete waste of time.

582
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:49,290
To remove the pump with the attached hose and wiring,

583
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,260
simultaneously release the three tangs

584
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:55,970
while pulling the pump out of the retainer along with the line and wiring.

585
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,170
You lied to me.

586
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,250
Did I?

587
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:11,600
I thought I was earning humanity's right to survive.

588
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:14,830
It's not a vending machine,laura.

589
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,260
You don't save a life,and then...

590
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:18,940
cue the celestial trumpets... here's the way to earth.

591
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,140
I know.

592
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,150
Jump!

593
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:26,510
Disorienting,isn't it?

594
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:30,140
All these little limping steps back.

595
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:31,970
I like it.

596
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:35,000
I'm used to it.

597
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:39,320
Every jump brings us a little bit closer to home.

598
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,920
Galactica.

599
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:44,810
My home.

600
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:53,800
Maybe there's something there for me.

601
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:58,730
Maybe even closer.

602
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,890
Missed you.

603
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,300
Me too.

604
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,910
I love you.

605
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:51,870
About time.

606
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:58,950

607
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,850
Listen to : Thin Lizzy

608
