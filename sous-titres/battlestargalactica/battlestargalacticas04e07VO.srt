1
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,170
Previously on Battlestar GALACTICA...

2
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,980
I'm giving you a ship. Now go.

3
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,910
Find a way to Earth.

4
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,010
Kara,I'm alone,

5
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:30,920
this is not an attack.

6
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,090
I knew I'd find you.

7
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:32,950
Leoben?

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,330
I'm here to offer a truce
between human and cylon

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,610
and a chance for you to
complete your journey.

10
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:39,680
The hybrid.

11
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,500
You need to go to her,Kara.

12
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:44,760
She'll tell you the way to get to Earth.

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,890
We're done here.

14
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,540
Get him out of here.

15
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:49,470
We're ready to jump back
to the fleet on your order.

16
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,720
We're not going back to the fleet.

17
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,320
Captain Thrace,as XO of the Demetrius,

18
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,430
I'm hereby relieving you of command.

19
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,090
You son of a bitch.

20
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,180
Gaeta,abort the jump!

21
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,140
I'm gonna take Leoben
back to the baseship,

22
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,350
see if his story checks out.

23
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,230
We'll be waiting here
till the clock runs out.

24
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,130
looks like he wasn't
lying about a civil war.

25
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,600
This is it.

26
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,640
The comet.

27
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:14,800
It's the ship!

28
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,290
Thus will it come to pass.

29
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,740
You are the harbinger
of death, Kara Thrace.

30
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,760
You will lead them all to their end.

31
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,680
cylon baseship.

32
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:25,920
Demetrius,athena.

33
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,260
The baseship is ours.

34
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,660
Then let's go home.

35
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,450
now I have learned from
unimpeachable sources

36
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,190
that president Laura
Roslin has for some time now

37
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:45,670
been sharing hallucinogenic visions
with two cylons within our fleet:

38
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,010
One Sharon Agathon,sent on the
classified Demetrius mission,

39
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,890
and the other a cylon prisoner
being held aboard the Galactica.

40
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,420
It's not that easy,madam president.

41
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,800
No?You should try it sometime.

42
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,660
Most of the population
has heard that broadcast.

43
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,770
I would assume that's the point.

44
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,750
Look,I take no pleasure
in putting this before you.

45
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,860
In fact,they practically had
to push me through that door.

46
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,570
Well,I'm sure you're
quite happy to stay.

47
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,260
I can't put one foot in front of another

48
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,730
without someone blocking my path
asking me what the hell is going on!

49
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,110
- For the welfare of the fleet...
- excuse me.

50
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,080
As long as I am in this office,

51
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:25,450
the welfare of this fleet is not
something you need to worry about.

52
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,940
You owe the people a response.

53
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,870
I owe the people?

54
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,180
That's what I believe.

55
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,200
What if suddenly all your
beliefs were called into question?

56
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,960
- Madam president...
- up is down.

57
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:36,770
Black is white.

58
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,300
Scripture is fiction.

59
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,590
Home is thin air instead
of solid ground,etcetera.

60
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,860
You know,I'm really sorry for
everything you've had to endure.

61
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:45,970
I really am.

62
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,730
But the people,they deserve a response.

63
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,490
Do they?

64
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,760
Is there any truth to this broadcast?

65
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,500
And what would you do
if I told you the truth?

66
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,550
What if it were you instead of me

67
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,050
and all that's left of
humanity has just been told

68
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,800
that you are sharing
visions with the enemy?

69
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,260
What would you do,mr. Adama?

70
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,200
Would you think that the
gods were testing you?

71
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:10,040
So Baltar is telling the truth?

72
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,690
Is it true?

73
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,260
Yes.

74
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,310
Demetrius reports their sys ops will
be synced with ours in five minutes.

75
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,480
When you came knocking with that
raider and asked for our help,

76
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,650
you gave away the future of
all the cylons aboard this ship.

77
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,350
You know that,right?

78
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,560
I gave it to the right person.

79
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,380
Save it.

80
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,910
No guarantees.

81
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,070
When we meet up with the colonial fleet,

82
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,660
I don't know if they'll feed
you or frak you,all right?

83
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,870
Since you've been calling
the plays up till now,

84
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,930
I'm assuming you're doing the talking.

85
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,190
Good.

86
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,310
Gods help us.

87
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,750
Sys ops of both vessels are synced.

88
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,580
We're as ready as we're ever gonna be.

89
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,460
Good.

90
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,040
Tell the Demetrius to
set the board to green.

91
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:15,860
Unless both ships jump in together,Galactica
will blow us out of the sky.

92
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,250
Demetrius,Athena.

93
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,820
Set your board to green.

94
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,240
Athena,Demetrius. Starting to green.

95
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,440
Let's run the horn,guys.

96
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,200
- Sublight.
- Go.

97
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,570
- Helm.
- Go.

98
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,610
- Tactical.
- Go.

99
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,820
- Nav.
- Go.

100
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,010
Ftl.

101
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,870
Spun up. Go.

102
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,080
Athena,Demetrius.

103
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,360
Board is green.

104
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,320
I was just thinking how
beautiful she must be.

105
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,730
Your daughter,Hera.

106
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,770
How do you know her name?

107
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,450
We all know her name.

108
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,990
You were blessed.

109
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,000
all right,everyone.

110
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,360
Let's go home.

111
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,360
Demetrius,Athena.

112
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:19,700
Execute jump.

113
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,050
Clock is running.

114
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:35,430
10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2.Jump.

115
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,240
Sir,we had a problem with the sync
points and the jump coordinates.

116
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,420
It'll take a few minutes to
spool up the ftl drive again.

117
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,560
Gods damn it!

118
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,430
all hands. Battle stations!

119
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,730
Set condition one throughout the fleet!

120
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,740
Launch alert five.

121
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,840
Get me some more
frakkin' birds in the air!

122
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:09,510
Gun batteries stand
by for target bearing!

123
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,530
Demetrius,Athena. Report.

124
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,820
Demetrius,Athena. Report.

125
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,240
Baseship bearing 3-3-3
carom 4-9-8 at 15 msu.

126
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,080
Frakkin' thing is sitting
right on top of us.

127
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:31,180
Mr. Hoshi,order the fleet
to make an emergency jump!

128
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:35,230
all colonial vessels jump immediately
to emergency rendez-vous coordinates.

129
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,520
Sir,the president's shuttle is en route.

130
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,010
tell them to land on landing bay 1.

131
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,070
Checkers green.

132
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,110
Galactica,Athena.

133
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,960
Last jump must've cooked the wireless.

134
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:53,790
We've got no com.

135
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,740
They can't hear us.

136
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,130
Frak.

137
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,550
Galactica's scrambling vipers.

138
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,050
They're going to shoot us down.

139
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,690
What the frak?

140
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,720
Eight vipers inbound.

141
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,200
Entering firing range.

142
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,920
Where the hell is the Demetrius?

143
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:27,630
baseship targeted.

144
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,430
Weapons free.

145
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,930
Something isn't right.

146
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,370
Gunnery reporting. Firing
solution correct.

147
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:35,040
Main battery standing by
to fire on your command.

148
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:42,460
- on my command. 3,2,1.
- Weapons hold!

149
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,280
dradis contact!

150
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,910
Galactica,Demetrius,do not fire.

151
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,930
Baseship is disarmed and under
colonial command. Officers aboard.

152
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,020
Demetrius,Galactica.

153
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,540
Authenticate.

154
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,080
Galactica,Demetrius.

155
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,030
I authenticate.

156
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,700
Bravo,tango,8.

157
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,700
Do not fire.

158
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,290
Starbuck and Athena have
control of the baseship.

159
00:08:18,255 --> 00:08:18,255
Battlestar
Galactica Season4 Episode07

160
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,910
colonel,they're with me.

161
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,700
They're with you?

162
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,880
So which one them shot Gaeta?

163
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:12,990
Lieutenant Gaeta,stay with us.

164
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,910
All right,everybody. Stand back.

165
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,280
And get a cut down
tray in here right now.

166
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,760
we became divided according to models.

167
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:27,570
The twos,eights,and
sixes have come to believe

168
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,590
that our destiny lies in
seeking out the final five.

169
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:34,700
The ones,fours,and fives
violently opposed such action.

170
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:37,600
We know that there are seven
different models of cylons.

171
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,710
You only mentioned six.

172
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,960
The 3s.

173
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,210
The D'Anna's.

174
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,480
They were boxed after the
battle on the algae planet.

175
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,440
Boxed?

176
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,240
Her entire line was
punitively deactivated.

177
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:52,780
Her consciousness placed
in a boxing facility.

178
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,790
Why?

179
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,690
D'Anna saw the faces of the
final five,which was forbidden.

180
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:03,490
But if we unbox her,she can
reveal their identities to us.

181
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:06,160
the final five have been to earth.

182
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,870
If we help find them,they
can help us get there.

183
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,320
Our ship can heal itself.

184
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:15,030
But most of our raiders
were destroyed in the ambush.

185
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,760
We're asking for your help
here. We can't do it alone.

186
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:20,020
What could possibly
motivate us to trust you now?

187
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,780
What have you got?

188
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:28,550
The boxing facility resides
within the cylon resurrection hub.

189
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:33,300
This hub controls the functions of
every resurrection ship in existence.

190
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:36,550
It protects itself by periodically
jumping to a new set of coordinates

191
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,740
and then relaying them
back to the baseship.

192
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:44,400
Madam president,you asked
for a reason to help us.

193
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,410
Vengeance.

194
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:53,250
You destroy the hub,cylons
lose their ability to download.

195
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,920
All of us.

196
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:01,560
Why would you be willing to
lose your ability to resurrect?

197
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,270
We're rebels.

198
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,430
We can't go back.

199
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:10,260
What matters most to us
is being with the five.

200
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,750
D'Anna will be able to identify them.

201
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:18,350
We'll take you to the hub
if you help us unbox d'Anna.

202
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,740
Give us the coordinates
of the hub first.

203
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,500
No,I won't do that.

204
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,700
I said we would take you there.

205
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,470
Take her out. We're finished.

206
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,660
Wait.

207
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,400
Is your word good,admiral?

208
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,770
I'll give you the coordinates.

209
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,860
But I want your word.

210
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,180
Stand down.

211
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:43,120
You have my word.

212
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:47,070
Once their identities are
revealed and we come back here,

213
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:51,760
we'll be free to leave
your fleet with the five.

214
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,550
Yes.

215
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,740
They're here with you.

216
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,600
The final five are in your fleet.

217
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:05,490
That's why our raiders turned
back the attack in the nebula.

218
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,530
The weapons hold.

219
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,960
How the frak did you see that?

220
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:22,500
To be absolutely honest
with you,bill,I didn'T.

221
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,140
What can I say?We got lucky.

222
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:36,520
Well,let's get a raptor up to those
coordinates that that cylon gave us.

223
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,270
Maybe we can get lucky again.

224
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,500
Sir.

225
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,390
Tigh.

226
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,950
Thank you.

227
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:02,960
Lords of Kobol,shield your eyes.

228
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,610
Get it with the gun camera.

229
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,080
Hit override.

230
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,950
Kinda pretty,isn't it?

231
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,400
Tell it to the fleet.

232
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,550
No. No. Don't put me under. Please.

233
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,410
Just... just numb everything.

234
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,260
- Felix.
- Just do it.

235
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:47,720
I- I don't want to wake up... I don't
want to wake up with my leg gone.

236
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,740
Okay,son.

237
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,800
If we go in on our own horse,we
won't last five minutes.

238
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:43,280
But we go in with that
baseship parked out there,

239
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:44,670
nobody's gonna notice us for awhile.

240
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:47,070
What do we fight with?Their
raiders are frakked.

241
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,020
We don't use theirs.

242
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,240
We use ours.

243
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,610
Take half the viper wing.

244
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,280
- Half the wing?
- Yeah.

245
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,290
We'll sneak them in
on the rebel baseship.

246
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,950
Hoshi did some calculations
from racetrack's photos.

247
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,500
We take out the ftl
and the hub's stranded.

248
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:04,810
We blow the hub and,uh,billions of
skin jobs lose their bath privileges.

249
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,280
imagine.

250
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:09,540
Once they're gone,they can't come back.

251
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,970
Mortal enemies.

252
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,990
Before we blow the hub,we need
to get a team in to unbox d'anna.

253
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:19,240
Well,now,maybe we just don'T.

254
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,500
Maybe we just forget the
gods damn boxing facility.

255
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:23,600
Lie to the rebels.

256
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,750
Well,they're lying to us.

257
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:30,470
The skin jobs said their raiders won't
fight because the final five is here?

258
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:34,910
We tangled with those slit-eyed
black bastards for three years now,

259
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,260
and they haven't turned
back before. Why now?

260
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:38,950
What if they're telling the truth?

261
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,730
What if the final five are here?

262
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,590
The five could know the way to earth.

263
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,310
If they knew,they're
not gonna lead us there

264
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,200
after we've just destroyed
their resurrection capacity.

265
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,270
Maybe they're different,like the rebels.

266
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,610
What if they're not?

267
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:53,170
What if their sole
purpose is to destroy us?

268
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:56,560
I say we blow the whole
gods damn thing to dust...

269
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,260
lock,stock,and barrel... and
trust the president's vision,

270
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,270
her scriptures,her way to earth.

271
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,150
Why don't we split the difference?

272
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:07,270
Unbox d'Anna and find the five.

273
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,520
Keep the five till we get to earth.

274
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:09,570
Turn them over to the rebels.

275
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,110
They've waited this long.

276
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,070
It'll be on our terms.

277
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:19,220
It's all pie in the sky,gentlemen,until
we know what's true and what's not.

278
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:20,690
And we put a lid on it.

279
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,570
The real plan stays in this room.

280
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:26,030
If the plan gets leaked to
the cylons,all bets are off.

281
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:28,750
Have someone escort the rebel
leader back to her baseship

282
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,240
so she can inform her
people they have a deal.

283
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:05,450
"In 36 hours,"the colonies will unite
forces "with insurgent rebel cylons

284
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,210
and their leader

285
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,730
"in an unprecedented
joint military operation

286
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:16,150
"to destroy the cylons'
ability to download into.

287
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,210
" blah blah blah.

288
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:25,030
Why weren't we consulted?

289
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,090
I'm sorry.

290
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,200
I'm in the dark as much as all of you.

291
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,820
you know,if they unbox the D'Annas,at
least we'll find out who the fifth one is.

292
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:44,500
All that's gonna do is
crowd the airlock a little more.

293
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:48,460
Do you think they're gonna give you a
medal when they find out who you are?

294
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,720
what about you?

295
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,530
He sings,you know.

296
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:55,920
- What?
- Gaeta.

297
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,020
Whenever he feels the tingling.

298
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,280
Whenever he feels his phantom leg.

299
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:04,390
Cottle says it helps him get through it.

300
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:13,400
He sings.

301
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,120
Good morning.

302
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,630
Morning.

303
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:33,050
What is it about the Galactica
that gives you such a glow?

304
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,410
I come over here,it's like I'm
going from one dungeon to the next.

305
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,890
Oh,I hadn't noticed.

306
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:38,670
But thank you.

307
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,530
You ready?

308
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,700
Yes.

309
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:44,070
I want you to find out who's
behind the shared vision rumors.

310
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,890
Who's talking to him?

311
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:47,050
With Baltar?

312
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,060
You're sleeping with him,right?

313
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,800
Don't.

314
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:59,120
I've just been informed that
you've been spotted down there

315
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:03,520
enough times to be a charter
member of his nymph squad.

316
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,590
All right.

317
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:19,360
I have come to believe in
Baltar's spiritual message.

318
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:21,040
I don't know how or why.

319
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,330
It just happened.

320
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:25,510
I wish you knew how many
times I wanted to tell you.

321
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:31,780
Your friendship and
your trust means... frak.

322
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:37,360
Clearly my friendship
and trust mean frak.

323
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,820
And I don't really care if
you have to spend the night

324
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:42,580
on your knees praying
or just on your knees.

325
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:43,630
I want a name.

326
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:48,000
I want to know who's
responsible for these lies.

327
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,320
Madam president.

328
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:58,760
Laura,I am so sorry.

329
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,820
You have a job to do.

330
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,120
The humans are never going to allow us

331
00:21:18,121 --> 00:21:19,980
to have the final five
and go our own way.

332
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,200
Are you sure of this?

333
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,800
Not entirely.

334
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:25,290
I'd rather be wrong.

335
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:27,120
But we need insurance.

336
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:31,100
Trust has to begin somewhere.

337
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:32,810
Not with us.

338
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,230
It's our ship.

339
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:40,330
When we jump,we take control
of it with the centurions.

340
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:42,790
We carry out the mission as promised.

341
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,970
But when we return,we take hostages.

342
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:52,700
The humans on this ship stay on
this ship until we have the five.

343
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,270
Look at me.

344
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,160
We've changed,but the humans haven'T.

345
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:03,310
We've come too far to risk
everything on their trust.

346
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:20,435
alone she sleeps in the shirt of man

347
00:22:20,436 --> 00:22:27,920
with my three wishes
clutched in her hand

348
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:37,730
the first that she be spared
the pain that comes from a dark

349
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:49,810
and laughing reign when she
finds love may it always stay true

350
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,810
what a way to discover
such a beautiful voice,huh?

351
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,370
How'd you find me?

352
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,560
Your chief of staff.

353
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,520
Needs to be horsewhipped.

354
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:04,420
If you came down here to kiss my ass
to get information,save your breath.

355
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:09,280
The quorum's considering a vote
of no confidence against you.

356
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,710
I won't compromise the
success of this operation

357
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:23,580
or the safety of this
fleet to indulge the

358
00:23:23,581 --> 00:23:27,270
neediness of 12 perpetually
unhappy representatives.

359
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,050
I can'T.

360
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:43,250
I was with them on
the,uh,emergency jump.

361
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:47,380
And I saw something in
the faces of the delegates.

362
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,260
It wasn't the anxiety from waiting.

363
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:50,240
It went beyond that.

364
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,010
I was anxious.

365
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:51,780
It was my first time.

366
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,540
But they... they.

367
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,490
they were empty.

368
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,970
The quorum had given up.

369
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:05,060
And then it struck me that after going

370
00:24:05,061 --> 00:24:09,100
through the same routine so many times,

371
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:15,960
it was the only way that they
could cope with the uncertainty.

372
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,600
To presume the worst.

373
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,880
You felt their suffering.

374
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:30,100
Now try holding their
lives in balance every day.

375
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,480
Talk to them.

376
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,130
You don't have to tell them everything.

377
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,250
I know how it works.

378
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,160
Just talk to the quorum.

379
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:43,630
Let them put a face
to this joint mission.

380
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,750
Let them hear from the cylon leader.

381
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:47,140
Anything.

382
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,260
Anything to put their fears to rest.

383
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:04,090
What's the matter?

384
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,320
- Nothing.
- No,nothing.

385
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:09,340
Nothing at all.

386
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:11,950
We've been lying here doing nothing.

387
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,470
What?

388
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,320
You've been lying about the
president sharing visions with cylons.

389
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:27,600
That happens to be
the god's honest truth.

390
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:28,560
Sorry.

391
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:30,360
I can't accept what you've done.

392
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:32,240
What... what I've done?

393
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:33,730
What have I...?

394
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:40,660
What are... where's this coming from?

395
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,040
These rumors you've started.

396
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:48,360
I've seen what they've done to her.

397
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:51,410
You seriously believe that
I'm making all this up?

398
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:55,050
I am not saying I'm not
capable,but why would I?

399
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,670
Six revealed it.

400
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:11,680
Caprica six revealed them
to me through my attorney

401
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:19,580
in the last days of my trial when
a guilty verdict was a certainty.

402
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,290
I suppose I could've gone public.

403
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:26,580
- Caused a stir.
- And all this time,you kept quiet.

404
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,410
I'm not saying I'm a saint,tory.

405
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:35,780
I'm many things.

406
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,270
But I try not to be spiteful.

407
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:42,390
Got no bloodlust to go get her.

408
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:44,330
But she's a hypocrite.

409
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:45,780
The lies.

410
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:49,300
The secret missions.

411
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:54,810
Co-opting the rhetoric of patriotism to
keep everyone in the dark,including you.

412
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,570
That's rather worrying,isn't it?

413
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,730
So I had to speak.

414
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:11,020
The truth is,no good ever
comes from concealing it.

415
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,730
I've got a broadcast.

416
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:24,000
The first that she be spared the pain

417
00:27:24,001 --> 00:27:30,680
that comes from a
dark and laughing reign

418
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:43,460
when she finds love
may it always stay true

419
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:51,200
this I beg for the
second wish I made too

420
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:58,310
I didn't come here to beg or plead
or apologize or to keep my job.

421
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,760
You know me better than that.

422
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:04,590
And I didn't come here to create sympathy
by parading my illness in front of you.

423
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,300
On the contrary,there are some

424
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:10,060
that probably believe that
along with my cancer and drugs,

425
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:14,120
I have inoculated myself
against compassion.

426
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,970
That is a joke.

427
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:22,900
I am here because I want
to tell you face to face

428
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:26,750
that I believe in this mission
and what it means for our future.

429
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:32,040
I'm here to profess my
trust in our new allies.

430
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,510
I'm here to ask you to listen.

431
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:37,740
I'm here to ask for your support.

432
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,060
Bring her in.

433
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:18,500
In our civil war,we've seen death.

434
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,970
We've watched our people die.

435
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,380
Gone forever.

436
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:26,800
As terrible as it was beyond the
reach of the resurrection ships,

437
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,850
something began to change.

438
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:39,360
We could feel a sense of time,as if
each moment held its own significance.

439
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:47,550
We began to realize that for our
existence to hold any value,it must end.

440
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:53,490
To live meaningful lives,we
must die and not return.

441
00:29:54,310 --> 00:30:00,120
The one human flaw that you spend
your lifetimes distressing over...

442
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:07,480
mortality... is the one thing.

443
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,380
well,it's the one thing
that makes you whole.

444
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:17,350
I believe it was no accident
that we were found by Kara Thrace.

445
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,280
It was destiny.

446
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,450
She asked me to leave
my people,and I accepted.

447
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:26,960
No matter what the sacrifice
even if it should mean my death.

448
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,170
thus shall it come to pass.

449
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:30,880
The dying leader shall know
the truth of the opera house.

450
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:33,980
You are the harbinger
of death,kara thrace.

451
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,700
Our destiny.

452
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,140
Our future.

453
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,320
Begins here.

454
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:58,890
Thank you for giving me
the opportunity to speak.

455
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:00,510
take her out.

456
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:15,920
But wish no more my
life you can take to have

457
00:31:15,921 --> 00:31:26,180
her please just one day
wake to have her please

458
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:37,600
alone she sleeps in the shirt of man

459
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:42,290
with my three wishes
clutched in her hand

460
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,580
Hera!

461
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,740
Hera.

462
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,360
Bye-bye.

463
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:13,490
I gotta hand it to you.

464
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,860
If you are a cylon,that
was a great plan.

465
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,280
Dangle yet another way to earth.

466
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:22,430
Throw in the hub,the final
five,and the real kicker,

467
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,510
put the final five on the fleet.

468
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,090
Even I couldn't pass that one up.

469
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,910
You are having those visions,aren't you?

470
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,980
Thus shall it come to pass.

471
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:45,970
The dying leader shall know
the truth of the opera house.

472
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,320
What did you say?

473
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,070
Thus shall it come to pass.

474
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,980
The opera house.

475
00:33:56,670 --> 00:34:00,220
The dying leader shall know
the truth of the opera house.

476
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,320
Where did... where did you hear that?

477
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:07,070
Who told you that?

478
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:10,520
The hybrid from the baseship
before they unplugged it.

479
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,040
The hybrid.

480
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:17,410
How does the hybrid
know what's in my dream?

481
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,590
I wish I knew.

482
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,240
This has got to stop.

483
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:29,550
These visions.

484
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,430
I've got to find out
about these visions.

485
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,190
I've got to know.

486
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:41,040
Will you help me?

487
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,070
Yes.

488
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:50,220
Find captain Agathon.

489
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:58,270
when I spoke to the
quorum,I could feel it.

490
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,880
The contempt.

491
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,260
You were right.

492
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:03,640
They're not ready to trust us.

493
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,080
No,I was wrong.

494
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:07,310
We're not ready.

495
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,340
We're deceiving them.

496
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:11,010
For protection.

497
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:12,150
For necessity.

498
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,850
Out of suspicion and fear.

499
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:18,010
Why haven't the final five come forward?

500
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:21,510
What if they're watching,judging
us on our actions?

501
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:25,640
We're about to resort
to violence and coercion.

502
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,630
What if they refuse to come with us?

503
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:30,800
We can't do this.

504
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,110
It's too late.

505
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:39,360
We have to order the
centurions to stand down.

506
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,270
It's too late.

507
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,270
They're committed.

508
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,800
Then we have to tell
the humans the truth.

509
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,010
No,you can't do that.

510
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:51,300
They'll never trust us again.

511
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,430
They already know the coordinates.

512
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,790
They'll just go destroy everything.

513
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:56,500
Go.

514
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:58,940
Stall for time.

515
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,760
Talk to Adama.

516
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:02,480
Tell them anything.

517
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:04,150
Anything but the truth.

518
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,320
I'll deal with the centurions.

519
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:40,760
Of course.

520
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:42,130
Have a seat.

521
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:49,300
We're going to settle this now.

522
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,050
What's to settle?

523
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:54,160
Your chief of staff is
incomparably talented.

524
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:59,570
I've been sharing visions with
Sharon Agathon and the six.

525
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:02,040
So I was only speaking the truth.

526
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:03,650
Yes.

527
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:09,510
The hybrid on the baseship spoke of
an opera house and a dying leader.

528
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:12,470
We're going to talk to the hybrid.

529
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:15,440
And why would you require my presence?

530
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:19,130
