00:00:19,992 --> 00:00:22,409
<i>Previously on</i> Battlestar Galactica...

2
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:24,890
Aurora, Goddess of the dawn.

3
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,781
I thought  it would be a nice figurehead
for your model ship.

4
00:00:27,941 --> 00:00:30,092
- A fresh start.
- Thank you.

5
00:00:31,405 --> 00:00:34,662
- <i>Starbuck, you're getting too low!</i>
- Come on, Lee, get her out of there.

6
00:00:34,823 --> 00:00:36,748
- You come back!
- Just let me go.

7
00:00:39,285 --> 00:00:40,085
No!

8
00:00:40,753 --> 00:00:43,046
Baltar's trial
may have been the trigger,

9
00:00:43,206 --> 00:00:45,548
but this is a feeling
I've been having for a while.

10
00:00:45,709 --> 00:00:47,052
It's time for a change.

11
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:50,437
Please, God, don't let this child die.

12
00:00:50,964 --> 00:00:53,223
How can you take him and let me live?

13
00:00:53,576 --> 00:00:55,564
God answered your prayers.
You have to see.

14
00:00:56,558 --> 00:00:58,565
- Look at him.
- And no trace of a fever.

15
00:00:58,685 --> 00:00:59,394
No.

16
00:00:59,514 --> 00:01:00,905
It's a miracle.

17
00:01:01,634 --> 00:01:03,580
I need to know about the other five.

18
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,497
The types we've never seen.

19
00:01:06,129 --> 00:01:07,862
It's true.
We're Cylons.

20
00:01:09,138 --> 00:01:10,829
And we have been from the start.

21
00:01:10,949 --> 00:01:14,180
Even after that Raider scanned me
with that red light,

22
00:01:14,506 --> 00:01:15,945
damn thing just cut and ran.

23
00:01:16,065 --> 00:01:17,866
You think it recognized you as a Cylon?

24
00:01:18,032 --> 00:01:20,291
Maybe that's why it didn't shoot me.
More important,

25
00:01:20,604 --> 00:01:22,048
why didn't I shoot him?

26
00:01:22,342 --> 00:01:23,996
Okay, what the hell's going on?

27
00:01:24,116 --> 00:01:27,098
- I'm off the ship for a few hours...
- A few hours?

28
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,801
Kara, you were gone for over two months.

29
00:01:30,518 --> 00:01:31,819
That's impossible.

30
00:01:32,281 --> 00:01:33,471
How did you get here?

31
00:01:33,632 --> 00:01:35,565
I told you, I don't know exactly.

32
00:01:35,685 --> 00:01:38,184
Damn it, they're still going
in the wrong direction.

33
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:40,520
One more jump and I'm gonna lose
my way altogether.

34
00:01:40,681 --> 00:01:43,064
It's Roslin.
The old man's not gonna listen to me.

35
00:01:43,224 --> 00:01:44,279
I gotta get to her.

36
00:01:45,518 --> 00:01:46,488
No, wait!

37
00:02:06,831 --> 00:02:10,381
Look alive! And for frak sake,
don't shoot the godsdamned President!

38
00:02:10,501 --> 00:02:11,789
Just let me talk to her.

39
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:14,345
Talk all you want,
but it ends with the first bang.

40
00:02:14,506 --> 00:02:17,102
<i>We're rollin' down here.
Starbuck's got the President.</i>

41
00:02:17,222 --> 00:02:18,626
Gaeta, take the com.

42
00:02:26,435 --> 00:02:27,253
Move.

43
00:02:29,891 --> 00:02:30,708
Move!

44
00:02:40,516 --> 00:02:41,497
Come on.

45
00:02:42,091 --> 00:02:43,484
Move, come on!

46
00:02:45,446 --> 00:02:46,772
Over by the couch.

47
00:02:47,478 --> 00:02:48,295
Now!

48
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,863
I want to hate you so much.

49
00:03:06,742 --> 00:03:07,764
So much.

50
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:16,011
You had a vision, remember?

51
00:03:17,372 --> 00:03:19,088
The arrow, the temple.

52
00:03:20,344 --> 00:03:22,496
I went down to that planet with you,

53
00:03:22,657 --> 00:03:24,858
and it was a frakkin' toaster party.

54
00:03:24,978 --> 00:03:27,210
A lot of good people died, remember?

55
00:03:27,768 --> 00:03:28,845
Yes, I do.

56
00:03:29,737 --> 00:03:31,019
I trusted you.

57
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:33,359
On a vision.

58
00:03:35,496 --> 00:03:36,610
That's it...

59
00:03:37,465 --> 00:03:38,542
a vision!

60
00:03:40,774 --> 00:03:41,891
I saw...

61
00:03:42,724 --> 00:03:43,616
Earth.

62
00:03:45,195 --> 00:03:47,015
I saw it with my own eyes.

63
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,717
And it's calling me back.

64
00:03:51,435 --> 00:03:53,076
We're going the wrong way.

65
00:03:54,594 --> 00:03:56,359
Why can't you trust me?

66
00:04:00,501 --> 00:04:01,578
Shoot me.

67
00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:06,374
If you think I'm a Cylon,
them I'm your enemy.

68
00:04:06,865 --> 00:04:08,258
Shoot your enemy.

69
00:04:12,957 --> 00:04:13,979
Take it!

70
00:04:19,915 --> 00:04:21,884
I'm no more a Cylon than you are.

71
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:23,834
And you know it.

72
00:04:27,012 --> 00:04:28,348
I wish I did.

73
00:04:32,393 --> 00:04:34,944
I've put my life on the line
for this frakkin' ship.

74
00:04:35,105 --> 00:04:38,697
I have ate, slept, and fought
next to the people that I love.

75
00:04:38,857 --> 00:04:40,735
I have pissed off my friends!

76
00:04:40,855 --> 00:04:42,868
I have broken more rules
than I've followed!

77
00:04:43,028 --> 00:04:45,360
I frakked up, okay! I messed up!

78
00:04:48,385 --> 00:04:50,131
But it's all that I have.

79
00:04:52,323 --> 00:04:54,087
Those people are my family.

80
00:04:56,094 --> 00:04:57,988
And none of us belong here.

81
00:04:59,795 --> 00:05:01,178
Two down. We've got two down!

82
00:05:02,798 --> 00:05:05,222
Shoot me!
If I'm a Cylon, shoot me!

83
00:05:05,342 --> 00:05:07,377
They made you perfect, didn't they?

84
00:05:16,619 --> 00:05:18,529
Down on the floor now!

85
00:05:18,772 --> 00:05:20,278
- Now!
- Let go of me!

86
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:23,009
Get off me! Get off me!

87
00:05:23,325 --> 00:05:25,888
What are you doing?
I am not a Cylon, Mathias!

88
00:05:26,331 --> 00:05:28,393
- Madam President.
- Gods!

89
00:05:30,436 --> 00:05:32,888
What the frak's going on here?
I thought you were on the move.

90
00:05:33,008 --> 00:05:34,628
She's out of her frakkin' mind.

91
00:05:35,549 --> 00:05:36,362
Gods!

92
00:05:36,482 --> 00:05:38,205
- You all right?
- Get off me!

93
00:05:39,042 --> 00:05:40,174
Get off!

94
00:05:46,881 --> 00:05:48,309
Listen to me, please.

95
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,164
I'm losing it.

96
00:05:52,414 --> 00:05:53,603
The ringing...

97
00:05:54,308 --> 00:05:55,721
The way to Earth...

98
00:05:56,352 --> 00:05:57,857
It's getting weaker.

99
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,811
Don't you understand?

100
00:06:02,755 --> 00:06:04,807
Don't any of you understand?!

101
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,673
It was so... It was so clear.

102
00:06:11,313 --> 00:06:13,542
Like it was coming from the next room.

103
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:17,421
Stop looking at me like that.

104
00:06:21,043 --> 00:06:22,864
I can feel it slipping away.

105
00:06:24,313 --> 00:06:26,886
Even without jumping, as we move,

106
00:06:28,334 --> 00:06:31,371
it's half of what it was
when I got here.

107
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:33,609
Half.

108
00:06:35,957 --> 00:06:38,219
If we keep jumping, it'll be gone,

109
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:40,155
and we'll never find it again.

110
00:06:41,697 --> 00:06:44,781
I thought that's what we wanted.
A way to Earth.

111
00:06:45,413 --> 00:06:47,865
- Do you hear me?
- Get her out of here.

112
00:06:47,985 --> 00:06:50,621
- Yes, sir. Let's go!
- You better work on your aim,

113
00:06:50,782 --> 00:06:52,584
because I'm not gonna stop!

114
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:54,906
You're gonna have to kill me!

115
00:06:56,038 --> 00:06:58,713
One more jump and it'll be gone!

116
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,385
Admiral!

00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:54,623
The excited state decays
by vibrational relaxation

123
00:07:54,743 --> 00:07:56,811
into the first excited singlet state.

124
00:07:56,931 --> 00:07:58,788
Yes, yes, and merrily we go.

125
00:07:59,404 --> 00:08:02,782
Reduce atmospheric nitrogen by 0.03%.

126
00:08:03,176 --> 00:08:06,358
It is not much consolation
that society will pick up the bits,

127
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:08,413
leaving us at eight modern
where punishment,

128
00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:10,408
rather than interdiction, is paramount.

129
00:08:10,609 --> 00:08:12,059
Please, cut the fuse.

130
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,043
They will not harm their own.
End of line.

131
00:08:15,163 --> 00:08:17,036
Limiting diffusions to two dimensions

132
00:08:17,156 --> 00:08:20,556
increases the number of
evolutionary jumps within the species.

133
00:08:20,956 --> 00:08:23,206
Rise and measure the temple of the five.

134
00:08:23,612 --> 00:08:25,414
Transformation is the goal.

135
00:08:25,808 --> 00:08:27,573
They will not harm their own.

136
00:08:28,464 --> 00:08:30,229
Datafont synchronization complete.

137
00:08:30,349 --> 00:08:32,427
The hybrid
is clearly telling us something.

138
00:08:32,547 --> 00:08:34,338
The hybrid
is always telling us something.

139
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:37,310
They're supposed to maintain operations
on each ship,

140
00:08:37,508 --> 00:08:39,394
not vomit metaphysics.

141
00:08:43,492 --> 00:08:44,598
All right,

142
00:08:44,718 --> 00:08:47,404
I give up. What...
What is she trying to tell us?

143
00:08:47,618 --> 00:08:49,683
They're in the colonial fleet...

144
00:08:49,803 --> 00:08:51,231
With the humans.

145
00:08:52,251 --> 00:08:53,114
"They"?

146
00:08:54,847 --> 00:08:55,936
They who?

147
00:08:56,832 --> 00:08:57,955
The Final Five.

148
00:08:59,593 --> 00:09:01,167
The Raiders refuse to fight

149
00:09:01,327 --> 00:09:03,303
because they sense
the Final Five might be

150
00:09:03,423 --> 00:09:06,303
- in the colonial fleet.
- They could have been caught or hiding.

151
00:09:06,423 --> 00:09:07,639
No way, stop.

152
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:09,036
Stop, right now.

153
00:09:09,335 --> 00:09:11,310
Turn around,
go and take a cleansing walk,

154
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,823
and I am gonna try
and forget what I just heard.

155
00:09:13,943 --> 00:09:16,666
The Final Five... Cavil, they're near.
This is far too important.

156
00:09:16,786 --> 00:09:18,876
What their eyes must have seen,
witnessed over time...

157
00:09:18,996 --> 00:09:21,229
- Think they look anything like us?
- That's enough!

158
00:09:21,533 --> 00:09:25,442
Don't you realize what you're doing?
You're openly discussing the Final Five!

159
00:09:29,108 --> 00:09:30,507
That's forbidden!

160
00:09:33,626 --> 00:09:35,629
You're toying with our survival.

161
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,993
Look at yourselves.

162
00:09:38,113 --> 00:09:40,919
Look,
there's millions of Twos have that nose.

163
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,064
Millions of Sixes possess that mouth.

164
00:09:43,244 --> 00:09:46,408
Eights share those breasts,
and Ones have this brain.

165
00:09:46,682 --> 00:09:48,464
We're mechanized copies.

166
00:09:49,227 --> 00:09:52,145
There's a reason
the original programmers clearly felt

167
00:09:52,265 --> 00:09:54,596
that it's a mistake
for us to contact the Final Five!

168
00:09:54,812 --> 00:09:56,965
- No!
- Violating that programming

169
00:09:57,526 --> 00:09:59,011
threatens our survival!

170
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:00,939
Something has changed.

171
00:10:01,429 --> 00:10:04,409
Thoughts have changed.
Yes, they change. The Raiders changed.

172
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:06,970
That's where all this started,
with them.

173
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:09,341
Somehow they exceeded their programming,

174
00:10:09,461 --> 00:10:11,643
and unlike us,
they can't correct themselves.

175
00:10:11,763 --> 00:10:13,542
So we're gonna have to do it for them.

176
00:10:13,662 --> 00:10:14,406
Do what?

177
00:10:15,007 --> 00:10:17,577
We'll reconfigure
their neural architecture,

178
00:10:17,737 --> 00:10:20,121
and shave down
their heuristic responses.

179
00:10:20,774 --> 00:10:22,540
Dumb them down? Lobotomize them?

180
00:10:22,901 --> 00:10:24,574
They're tools, not pets.

181
00:10:25,261 --> 00:10:27,377
But in any case, it has to be done.

182
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,630
Says who?

183
00:10:28,868 --> 00:10:32,313
Says God almighty,
the voice of reason, that's who!

184
00:10:32,996 --> 00:10:34,719
When are you gonna hear it?

185
00:10:35,437 --> 00:10:39,442
You don't have the authority to make
any change without a majority vote.

186
00:10:40,094 --> 00:10:42,852
Well, we'll vote.
The Fours and Fives will be on my side.

187
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:44,459
There will be a vote.

188
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:46,218
The Raiders hear what we hear.

189
00:10:46,338 --> 00:10:48,232
The Raiders are simple machines.

190
00:10:48,605 --> 00:10:49,313
No.

191
00:10:49,536 --> 00:10:52,926
Something extraordinary has happened.
Something is calling to us.

192
00:10:53,046 --> 00:10:56,987
Pushing us to discover our origins,
to understand our place in the universe.

193
00:10:57,787 --> 00:10:59,939
The Raiders are part of that,
and the Final Five...

194
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,697
Are anywhere but with the humans.

195
00:11:11,445 --> 00:11:12,489
You're late.

196
00:11:13,788 --> 00:11:16,112
I had to wait
for Cally to nod off, okay?

197
00:11:16,232 --> 00:11:18,324
- She's having trouble sleeping.
- Did you see Kara?

198
00:11:18,506 --> 00:11:20,695
I saw her. She's crazy as a latrine rat.

199
00:11:20,815 --> 00:11:22,934
If anything,
she's more like Starbuck than ever.

200
00:11:23,094 --> 00:11:24,185
She's my wife!

201
00:11:24,345 --> 00:11:26,604
And the President nearly
put a bullet in her skull

202
00:11:26,724 --> 00:11:28,989
because she suspected her
of being a Cylon.

203
00:11:29,109 --> 00:11:30,149
You are one!

204
00:11:31,317 --> 00:11:33,903
We bring attention to ourselves,
we're frakked!

205
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:38,366
If Starbuck is one of us,
she's playing it big the other way.

206
00:11:39,512 --> 00:11:42,528
The four of us heard the music
and sought each other out.

207
00:11:43,501 --> 00:11:44,648
She hasn't.

208
00:11:46,228 --> 00:11:47,778
We're still missing one.

209
00:11:50,098 --> 00:11:50,994
Baltar.

210
00:11:53,186 --> 00:11:54,653
Not Baltar, but...

211
00:11:55,734 --> 00:11:58,637
when I found him
in the temple on the algae planet,

212
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:02,397
he was with one of those skin jobs.
The one they call D'Anna.

213
00:12:02,517 --> 00:12:05,934
She saw something in there...
I don't know what. But they talked.

214
00:12:06,346 --> 00:12:07,645
He might know something.

215
00:12:08,508 --> 00:12:09,730
He's got those

216
00:12:10,248 --> 00:12:13,297
one-God nutcases
believing he's some kind of healer.

217
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:15,735
He brought some boy out from a coma.

218
00:12:17,011 --> 00:12:19,298
Maybe he knows who the fifth is.

219
00:12:20,264 --> 00:12:21,738
Maybe he knows who we are.

220
00:12:21,858 --> 00:12:24,466
Then we gotta get in close and find out.

221
00:12:25,858 --> 00:12:27,817
How do you propose we do that?

222
00:12:28,276 --> 00:12:29,792
Take him out for drinks?

223
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:32,685
Well, he is accomplished at two things.

224
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:35,543
Lying in his cell, and lying in a woman.

225
00:12:35,805 --> 00:12:37,258
He'd poke a skin job.

226
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:39,635
He racked up a Six... That's a given.

227
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,465
There is no way.

228
00:12:41,924 --> 00:12:44,882
You don't have to get
on your back for him, but...

229
00:12:45,002 --> 00:12:46,468
Oh, gee, thanks.

230
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:04,591
What were you doing?

231
00:13:05,517 --> 00:13:07,061
What were you thinking?

232
00:13:08,546 --> 00:13:09,707
What happened to you?

233
00:13:11,152 --> 00:13:12,576
I saw...

234
00:13:13,049 --> 00:13:13,866
Earth.

235
00:13:16,816 --> 00:13:19,148
The shape of it, the smell of it.

236
00:13:19,414 --> 00:13:21,383
The feel of it on my skin in my pores.

237
00:13:21,503 --> 00:13:24,463
And I swear to you,
it was like I'd been there before.

238
00:13:27,121 --> 00:13:28,484
Like I never left.

239
00:13:33,495 --> 00:13:35,095
You're too stupid to figure out

240
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:37,777
you just screwed over
the one ally you had.

241
00:13:38,239 --> 00:13:41,095
You didn't have the guts to hold on.

242
00:13:43,721 --> 00:13:44,753
Tell me...

243
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,656
Who's gonna help you?

244
00:13:53,869 --> 00:13:55,266
Yeah, frak me, huh?

245
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,787
It sure as hell isn't gonna be you.

246
00:14:00,761 --> 00:14:03,735
You've gotta remind yourself
that you're somebody else.

247
00:14:05,463 --> 00:14:07,465
You're the President's wet nurse.

248
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,354
You're the one
who doesn't have the guts.

249
00:14:20,238 --> 00:14:22,588
Nice to know you still care, Admiral.

250
00:14:41,008 --> 00:14:42,666
We're going the wrong way!

251
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:51,016
We have all conferred with our models,
and the results are in.

252
00:14:51,843 --> 00:14:54,493
The Fours and the Fives
have joined us Ones,

253
00:14:55,151 --> 00:14:57,172
and they voted
to reconfigure the Raiders.

254
00:14:57,342 --> 00:14:58,990
Gee, what a surprise.

255
00:14:59,778 --> 00:15:03,478
Well, the Twos, Sixes and Eights
voted against it, so we're deadlocked.

256
00:15:03,964 --> 00:15:08,025
How hopelessly... But you were right.
And I'm machine enough

257
00:15:08,285 --> 00:15:11,358
- to admit that I was wrong.
- What are you talking about?

258
00:15:11,528 --> 00:15:13,269
Something extraordinary

259
00:15:13,439 --> 00:15:14,990
has happened.

260
00:15:15,343 --> 00:15:16,177
Eight.

261
00:15:19,406 --> 00:15:21,003
What's going on?

262
00:15:26,763 --> 00:15:27,669
Boomer.

263
00:15:29,997 --> 00:15:31,090
I'm not going

264
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:35,510
to sugarcoat this.
I'll just say that this Eight

265
00:15:35,771 --> 00:15:37,921
- has voted to reconfigure.
- What?

266
00:15:38,091 --> 00:15:39,872
Shocked? I was shocked too.

267
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:45,603
But no one has ever voted
against their model.

268
00:15:46,856 --> 00:15:48,439
No one. Is this true?

269
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,608
We have to be able to defend ourselves.

270
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:55,029
No, this is unconscionable.
This is wrong. She can't.

271
00:15:55,715 --> 00:15:59,284
- You had something to do with this.
- No, it was her decision totally.

272
00:16:00,072 --> 00:16:02,846
- You cannot allow this.
- There is no law. There's no edict.

273
00:16:03,016 --> 00:16:05,262
There's nothing that forbids it.
It's just...

274
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:07,234
It's never happened before.

275
00:16:07,775 --> 00:16:10,651
Try and remember you said that
when he boxes your line.

276
00:16:10,771 --> 00:16:12,430
Now, don't be a sore loser.

277
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,683
If you do this, we all lose.

278
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:17,093
- We think it's for the best.
- The best?

279
00:16:17,528 --> 00:16:19,178
Have you lost your mind?

280
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:23,558
Our identies are determined
by our models. Each model is unique.

281
00:16:23,819 --> 00:16:25,310
We belong together.

282
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:30,233
You know this better than anyone.
"Mechanized copies."

283
00:16:30,403 --> 00:16:34,003
- Those are your very words.
- "Something has changed."

284
00:16:34,173 --> 00:16:37,572
Those are your very words.
And I whole heartedly agree.

285
00:16:38,026 --> 00:16:40,241
The Raiders are sentient,
just as we are.

286
00:16:40,654 --> 00:16:43,160
There was a plan.
A divine plan in our design.

287
00:16:43,565 --> 00:16:46,609
- You're butchering them.
- We're reconfiguring them.

288
00:16:46,779 --> 00:16:48,341
You are not God.

289
00:16:49,154 --> 00:16:51,712
No... I'm a mechanic.

290
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:55,382
The Raiders were designed
to do a specific job.

291
00:16:55,642 --> 00:16:58,115
They stopped doing it. I'm fixing that.

292
00:16:58,653 --> 00:17:01,859
And when the cutting's all done,
they'll go back to being happy warriors.

293
00:17:02,029 --> 00:17:03,879
So let's move on, all right?

294
00:17:11,466 --> 00:17:12,816
I'll pray for you.

295
00:17:13,341 --> 00:17:14,791
I'll pray hard.

296
00:17:47,106 --> 00:17:49,314
All right, you hooch hounds!

297
00:17:49,805 --> 00:17:50,895
Lock it up!

298
00:17:51,156 --> 00:17:53,732
It's time... Shut the frak up!

299
00:17:54,467 --> 00:17:55,916
Pay attention.

300
00:17:56,619 --> 00:17:58,310
We're saying good-bye...

301
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:01,129
to the best damn jock you...

302
00:18:01,463 --> 00:18:03,115
pink-ass cones will ever hope to see.

303
00:18:03,376 --> 00:18:04,659
Shut up.

304
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:06,038
Major?

305
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:08,002
- Let's go!
- Come on!

306
00:18:08,592 --> 00:18:11,703
- I have a drink.
- Let's do this. Come on now.

307
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:15,777
I'm not thirsty.

308
00:18:21,785 --> 00:18:23,040
To Galactica!

309
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:29,433
To the men and women of Galactica.

310
00:18:32,527 --> 00:18:33,785
To the Admiral...

311
00:18:35,622 --> 00:18:38,777
... who commands
the men and women of Galactica.

312
00:18:45,338 --> 00:18:48,410
And to our sweethearts,
husbands, and wives.

313
00:18:49,396 --> 00:18:51,081
To our sweethearts!

314
00:18:57,591 --> 00:18:59,002
To absent friends.

315
00:19:45,071 --> 00:19:46,093
Thank you.

316
00:19:48,586 --> 00:19:50,306
That's very sweet.

317
00:20:03,112 --> 00:20:04,696
Excuse me, will you?

318
00:20:14,118 --> 00:20:15,468
Watch your step.

319
00:20:17,241 --> 00:20:19,757
- You say what?
- Excuse me.

320
00:20:27,384 --> 00:20:30,756
You're spying on me, Tory.
I've seen you here.

321
00:20:32,271 --> 00:20:34,668
No. I heard about the miracle.

322
00:20:36,911 --> 00:20:38,133
The child?

323
00:20:38,548 --> 00:20:39,355
Yes.

324
00:20:40,992 --> 00:20:43,358
You mean Laura Roslin
has heard about it.

325
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:47,198
All right, I have been spying on you.

326
00:20:47,368 --> 00:20:50,196
Well, it's lucky
I was sitting down, isn't it?

327
00:20:51,181 --> 00:20:54,703
I've been watching these people.
The way they look at you.

328
00:20:56,507 --> 00:20:58,076
If you go squealing to the President

329
00:20:58,246 --> 00:21:00,448
that my newfound popularity borders
on the phenomenal,

330
00:21:00,618 --> 00:21:03,837
- then she should be very worried.
- I came here on my own.

331
00:21:04,098 --> 00:21:05,964
And I slept with your boss last night.

332
00:21:07,852 --> 00:21:08,925
Come on, be nice.

333
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:11,159
- What's it gonna cost you?
- My God.

334
00:21:11,329 --> 00:21:12,579
My giddy-od!

335
00:21:12,749 --> 00:21:14,267
Get a grip, Gaius.

336
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:18,018
She's not lying. She really could be
a wonderful source of information.

337
00:21:18,455 --> 00:21:20,771
- Why don't you feel her out?
- Feel her what?

338
00:21:21,032 --> 00:21:23,440
- What?
- I'm not talking to you. Actually...

339
00:21:24,141 --> 00:21:26,727
Try and forget me for a moment.

340
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:29,596
- Ask her what she's doing here.
- I am talking to you.

341
00:21:29,766 --> 00:21:32,687
- Why did you come here?
- Maybe it was a mistake.

342
00:21:34,947 --> 00:21:37,534
Well, I can't stop thinking
about what's happened.

343
00:21:37,704 --> 00:21:41,629
You were found innocent
when everyone hated you. I hated you.

344
00:21:41,762 --> 00:21:44,657
And this healed boy,
the return of Kara Thrace...

345
00:21:44,827 --> 00:21:47,213
I mean, everyone thought she was dead.

346
00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:51,219
- So perhaps there are miracles.
- Perhaps.

347
00:21:52,396 --> 00:21:55,660
Thing is, somehow you seem
to be at the center of them.

348
00:21:56,546 --> 00:21:58,049
Yes, I do, don't I?

349
00:22:00,318 --> 00:22:03,433
I don't understand myself, to be honest.
Just...

350
00:22:04,212 --> 00:22:05,751
Well, it seems that

351
00:22:06,115 --> 00:22:08,071
God has chosen me

352
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:11,214
to sing his song.

353
00:22:11,384 --> 00:22:13,801
- A song?
- Music. Did you say music?

354
00:22:14,502 --> 00:22:17,836
Yeah, you know, it's funny.
It's a lot like that. It's...

355
00:22:18,006 --> 00:22:20,900
It's like the distant chaos
of an orchestra

356
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:22,324
tuning up.

357
00:22:23,043 --> 00:22:23,876
And then

358
00:22:24,136 --> 00:22:26,003
somebody waves a magic wand,

359
00:22:27,188 --> 00:22:28,761
and all of those notes

360
00:22:29,034 --> 00:22:31,222
start to slide into place.

361
00:22:32,847 --> 00:22:34,178
A grotesque,

362
00:22:34,438 --> 00:22:36,064
screeching cacophony

363
00:22:36,795 --> 00:22:39,517
becomes a single melody.

364
00:22:40,824 --> 00:22:42,895
I really shouldn't be seen here.

365
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:51,070
Who the frak are you?!
What, am I supposed to be impressed?

366
00:22:51,946 --> 00:22:54,717
I mean, you're me.
Obviously you're me, so...

367
00:22:55,376 --> 00:22:57,294
Unless you're not me. Huh?

368
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:05,251
Six?

369
00:23:06,087 --> 00:23:07,568
Is it you, Six...

370
00:23:08,239 --> 00:23:09,826
Like in disguise?

371
00:23:10,683 --> 00:23:13,332
Now, why would she need
to disguise herself from you?

372
00:23:13,502 --> 00:23:16,083
- Well, you've got a very good point.
- Let's talk about Tory.

373
00:23:16,253 --> 00:23:18,504
- Where is she?
- We should talk about Tory,

374
00:23:18,674 --> 00:23:21,058
'cause we both know
where this is heading.

375
00:23:21,318 --> 00:23:23,128
You like her, don't you?

376
00:23:23,298 --> 00:23:25,413
Yeah, well, you know, she's...

377
00:23:25,716 --> 00:23:26,939
She's a sexy lady.

378
00:23:27,286 --> 00:23:28,565
Yeah, yeah.

379
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:30,486
Hot.

380
00:23:30,888 --> 00:23:33,576
- You slay me. You really do, Gaius.
- Why?

381
00:23:35,534 --> 00:23:38,498
She's more than all these things.
She's special.

382
00:23:39,826 --> 00:23:41,078
And you feel it.

383
00:23:41,572 --> 00:23:42,876
Yeah, fragile.

384
00:23:43,862 --> 00:23:45,958
Yeah, I sense that too.
You're very observant.

385
00:23:46,218 --> 00:23:47,084
Fragile.

386
00:23:47,405 --> 00:23:49,051
Handle with care.

387
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:50,471
Oh, I'd love to.

388
00:24:03,467 --> 00:24:05,869
You're enjoying that more than usual.

389
00:24:06,605 --> 00:24:07,903
Hair of the dog.

390
00:24:09,236 --> 00:24:10,319
Lee's party.

391
00:24:13,993 --> 00:24:16,488
What do we do now? Put her on trial?

392
00:24:16,748 --> 00:24:18,605
Find Romo Lampkin?

393
00:24:19,158 --> 00:24:20,450
Take a show of hands?

394
00:24:21,894 --> 00:24:23,110
I don't know.

395
00:24:24,827 --> 00:24:26,588
Follow her into an ambush?

396
00:24:28,658 --> 00:24:30,469
- She is driven.
- Yeah.

397
00:24:34,221 --> 00:24:37,821
You gonna keep waltzing,
or are you gonna sit down and talk?

398
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:40,719
What's going on? Sit.

399
00:24:54,414 --> 00:24:56,558
What if she's telling the truth?

400
00:24:58,876 --> 00:25:01,042
She was supposed to die out there.

401
00:25:01,522 --> 00:25:03,638
She didn't. I can't explain it.

402
00:25:05,051 --> 00:25:07,039
What if she was meant to help us?

403
00:25:08,689 --> 00:25:10,048
And this was a...

404
00:25:12,248 --> 00:25:13,170
A what?

405
00:25:14,537 --> 00:25:15,785
A miracle?

406
00:25:19,912 --> 00:25:23,122
Is that what you want to call this?
Go ahead, say it.

407
00:25:23,826 --> 00:25:26,880
Grab your piece of the golden arrow.
I want to hear

408
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:29,884
Admiral Atheist say
that a miracle happened.

409
00:25:31,146 --> 00:25:33,942
You shot at her
and you missed at close range.

410
00:25:35,525 --> 00:25:37,492
Doloxan fraks with your aim.

411
00:25:38,648 --> 00:25:39,780
So does doubt.

412
00:25:45,511 --> 00:25:48,163
I pulled the trigger
and I'd do it again.

413
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:52,014
She put her life in front of a bullet
as if it had no meaning.

414
00:25:52,184 --> 00:25:54,711
You drop an egg, you reach for another.

415
00:25:55,809 --> 00:25:59,190
Maybe convincing you
meant more to her than her own life.

416
00:25:59,592 --> 00:26:00,967
Is that your miracle?

417
00:26:02,171 --> 00:26:04,130
You want to talk about miracles?

418
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,876
The very same day

419
00:26:06,339 --> 00:26:09,203
that a very pale doctor informed me

420
00:26:09,557 --> 00:26:10,936
that I had terminal cancer,

421
00:26:11,422 --> 00:26:14,827
most of humanity was annihilated,
and I survived.

422
00:26:15,099 --> 00:26:18,610
And by some mathematical absurdity,
I became President.

423
00:26:19,425 --> 00:26:20,362
And then

424
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:22,656
my cancer disappeared

425
00:26:23,138 --> 00:26:26,546
long enough for us
to find a way to Earth.

426
00:26:27,528 --> 00:26:30,070
You can call it whatever you want.

427
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:33,438
And now I'm dying.

428
00:26:36,329 --> 00:26:37,802
Don't talk that way.

429
00:26:40,437 --> 00:26:42,111
You've gotta face this.

430
00:26:42,535 --> 00:26:44,416
My life is coming to an end soon enough,

431
00:26:44,586 --> 00:26:48,104
and I am not going to apologize
to you for not trusting her.

432
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:49,428
And I am not...

433
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:53,209
I am not going to trust
her with the fate of this fleet.

434
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:56,727
You are so buckled up inside...

435
00:26:58,341 --> 00:27:01,073
You can't take any more loss.
Your son's leaving...

436
00:27:01,243 --> 00:27:02,911
This, me... I know it.

437
00:27:04,586 --> 00:27:06,294
No one's going anywhere.

438
00:27:10,618 --> 00:27:11,493
Okay...

439
00:27:13,084 --> 00:27:14,473
Here's the truth.

440
00:27:14,783 --> 00:27:16,543
This is what's going on.

441
00:27:17,328 --> 00:27:19,162
You want to believe Kara.

442
00:27:20,845 --> 00:27:22,860
You would rather be wrong about her

443
00:27:23,243 --> 00:27:25,322
and face your own demise

444
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:28,328
than risk losing her again.

445
00:27:32,381 --> 00:27:34,371
You can stay in the room, but

446
00:27:36,156 --> 00:27:37,682
get out of my head.

447
00:27:46,755 --> 00:27:48,805
You're so afraid to live alone.

448
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:53,929
And you're afraid to die that way.

449
00:27:57,127 --> 00:28:00,045
You're afraid that you may not be
the dying leader you thought you were.

450
00:28:05,986 --> 00:28:07,901
Or that your death may be as

451
00:28:08,218 --> 00:28:09,327
meaningless

452
00:28:09,497 --> 00:28:11,003
as everyone else's.

453
00:28:57,571 --> 00:29:00,814
Zarek nominated me
for the vacant quorum spot, so I...

454
00:29:02,021 --> 00:29:03,334
You're Zarek's wing man.

455
00:29:03,504 --> 00:29:05,572
All right,
all right, you know, stow it, okay.

456
00:29:05,742 --> 00:29:08,738
I've heard it all before.
The guy's a piece of work, I know.

457
00:29:09,203 --> 00:29:12,002
His head's as big as
the house I grew up in but...

458
00:29:12,172 --> 00:29:15,490
I'm... I'm pretty new to all this.
I could use the help.

459
00:29:17,425 --> 00:29:20,083
Besides, I never really
could say no to anything.

460
00:29:21,708 --> 00:29:22,835
Except me.

461
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,852
Especially you.

462
00:29:29,611 --> 00:29:32,849
You know, I think I finally understand
what you meant about

463
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,810
having a destiny.

464
00:29:36,235 --> 00:29:37,558
I've got to do this.

465
00:29:38,838 --> 00:29:42,308
And the fact that I don't
have an explanation why doesn't...

466
00:29:43,203 --> 00:29:45,400
Doesn't really seem to matter anymore.

467
00:29:50,735 --> 00:29:51,906
So say we all.

468
00:29:57,788 --> 00:29:58,956
So say we all.

469
00:30:08,121 --> 00:30:10,466
Good luck on your journey, Lee Adama.

470
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:18,641
You too, Kara Thrace.

471
00:30:24,497 --> 00:30:25,612
All right.

472
00:30:31,672 --> 00:30:32,613
Lee...

473
00:31:00,731 --> 00:31:02,180
I believe you.

474
00:31:07,226 --> 00:31:10,610
<i>Red and blue sections will go first,
yellow and green will follow.</i>

475
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:13,408
<i>Starbuck, if you've got a problem,
I don't want to hear it.</i>

476
00:31:13,578 --> 00:31:17,452
<i>My only problem is you didn't preach
that sermon a week ago.</i>

477
00:31:17,622 --> 00:31:20,826
<i>Keep your ears open. Any Cylon contact,
just shut down, bug out.</i>

478
00:31:20,996 --> 00:31:23,488
<i>- Questions.
- When will you play to the card game?</i>

479
00:31:23,853 --> 00:31:27,216
<i>- We're on tomorrow night!
- All right, all right.</i>

480
00:31:28,113 --> 00:31:31,387
<i>Good luck.
And be careful out there.</i>

481
00:31:36,849 --> 00:31:38,572
Attention to orders!

482
00:31:47,703 --> 00:31:51,448
In recognition of honorable,
loyal, and faithful service,

483
00:31:52,056 --> 00:31:53,696
Madam President,

484
00:31:53,866 --> 00:31:55,882
Admiral of the Colonial Fleet,

485
00:31:56,052 --> 00:31:58,741
ladies and gentlemen...
Major Lee Adama...

486
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,609
Salute!

487
00:32:40,383 --> 00:32:41,784
Good luck.

488
00:33:24,797 --> 00:33:25,983
Thank you.

489
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,944
Well, it looks like you got the house.

490
00:33:36,616 --> 00:33:37,944
I'll miss you.

491
00:33:38,653 --> 00:33:39,971
Good-bye, Lee.

492
00:33:41,815 --> 00:33:43,082
Look after yourself.

493
00:34:17,978 --> 00:34:20,816
We want you
to stop lobotomizing the Raiders, Cavil.

494
00:34:23,198 --> 00:34:25,620
Raiders with free will?

495
00:34:26,467 --> 00:34:28,272
Not going to happen.

496
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:32,102
Do you know
what just really rankles my ass?!

497
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:33,946
You've been pointing fingers,

498
00:34:34,116 --> 00:34:37,357
falsely accusing me
of manipulation just short of tyranny.

499
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:40,190
When you're the one
that's been leading the charge here.

500
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,862
We want you to stop.

501
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:44,671
You're not in charge.
We had a vote.

502
00:34:46,871 --> 00:34:48,665
For the last time,

503
00:34:48,959 --> 00:34:51,705
will you stop lobotomizing the Raiders?

504
00:34:52,729 --> 00:34:55,351
It's unbelievable, isn't it?
Unbelievable.

505
00:34:55,865 --> 00:34:57,905
For the last time,

506
00:35:00,022 --> 00:35:00,945
no.

507
00:35:02,678 --> 00:35:04,481
I was afraid you'd say that.

508
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:07,596
Come in.

509
00:35:14,259 --> 00:35:15,771
What is this about?

510
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:18,148
Centurions can't vote, Six.

511
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:20,901
They're not here to vote, Cavil.

512
00:35:57,901 --> 00:36:00,130
- Am I hurting you?
- No.

513
00:36:01,539 --> 00:36:03,779
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

514
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,384
What do you mean, nothing?
You're crying.

515
00:36:10,761 --> 00:36:13,022
It's just something I do during sex.

516
00:36:16,944 --> 00:36:18,542
- All the time?
- Yeah.

517
00:36:19,893 --> 00:36:21,655
I'm really sorry.

518
00:36:22,508 --> 00:36:23,880
Don't be sorry.

519
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,964
Why should you apologize?

520
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:29,928
You should be thankful.

521
00:36:31,406 --> 00:36:33,788
You have an abundance of feeling.

522
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,045
I've never
really thought of it like that.

523
00:36:38,355 --> 00:36:39,855
You're blessed, aren't you?

524
00:36:40,716 --> 00:36:42,287
I don't know.

525
00:36:43,402 --> 00:36:44,912
I guess.

526
00:36:47,203 --> 00:36:49,453
I suppose I couldn't be a Cylon.

527
00:36:54,937 --> 00:36:57,045
Well, I don't know about that.

528
00:36:59,265 --> 00:37:03,044
Human beings don't exclusively
hold the patent on suffering.

529
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:05,571
Cylons can feel.

530
00:37:05,835 --> 00:37:07,799
- You believe that?
- Yeah, I do, actually.

531
00:37:08,531 --> 00:37:10,862
I've spent time amongst them.

532
00:37:15,129 --> 00:37:16,808
Man may have made them,

533
00:37:16,978 --> 00:37:19,185
but God's at the beginning
of the string, isn't he?

534
00:37:22,637 --> 00:37:25,859
It's God who made the real soul.
The one true God.

535
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:28,070
One God?

536
00:37:29,316 --> 00:37:31,293
The one true God.

537
00:37:32,433 --> 00:37:35,757
You know, I'm becoming
increasingly tired of holding that in.

538
00:37:36,983 --> 00:37:39,331
Of denying that essential truth.

539
00:37:49,244 --> 00:37:52,135
Now, this... This isn't funny.

540
00:37:56,962 --> 00:37:57,807
Leave.

541
00:37:59,952 --> 00:38:02,081
I said leave!

542
00:38:11,217 --> 00:38:12,447
Why don't they leave?

543
00:38:17,027 --> 00:38:18,469
The telencephalic inhibitor

544
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:21,414
that restricts higher functions
in the Centurions...

545
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,792
- We had them removed.
- Say what?!

546
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:25,530
You dumbed down the Raiders.

547
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:29,193
We the Leobens, the Sharons,
gave the Centurions the gift of reason.

548
00:38:29,363 --> 00:38:32,037
You have no authority to do this, none.

549
00:38:32,969 --> 00:38:34,606
You can't do anything without a vote!

550
00:38:34,726 --> 00:38:38,124
No, we can't do anything with one,
so we're finished voting.

551
00:38:46,606 --> 00:38:47,815
What have you done?

552
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:50,693
First thing they learned is
what you were doing to the Raiders.

553
00:38:51,197 --> 00:38:52,779
You can imagine how they felt.

554
00:38:55,812 --> 00:38:57,089
Oh, no.

555
00:39:30,329 --> 00:39:32,401
Sir, the fleet is prepped
and ready for jump.

556
00:39:32,711 --> 00:39:34,505
Execute jump.

557
00:39:40,339 --> 00:39:41,930
Go back!

558
00:39:43,587 --> 00:39:45,137
Go back...

559
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:13,359
Open cell.

560
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,661
Cuff her.

561
00:40:45,001 --> 00:40:46,050
So...

562
00:40:47,555 --> 00:40:50,104
You quietly cut me loose in deep space.

563
00:40:52,778 --> 00:40:54,025
I'm not afraid to die.

564
00:40:54,674 --> 00:40:57,194
Little easier
after you've been through it once.

565
00:40:58,697 --> 00:40:59,978
Harder.

566
00:41:00,367 --> 00:41:02,904
Especially now
that I'm seeing things so clearly.

567
00:41:04,647 --> 00:41:06,411
You're making a mistake.

568
00:41:06,857 --> 00:41:08,519
Maybe I am.

569
00:41:09,336 --> 00:41:11,389
But I can't take the chance
that you're right

570
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:13,294
and not do something about it.

571
00:41:29,524 --> 00:41:31,490
Helo hand-picked a crew for you.

572
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,481
I'm giving you a ship.

573
00:41:34,491 --> 00:41:36,326
I hope you can stand the smell.

574
00:41:37,217 --> 00:41:39,332
We liberated the Demetrius.

575
00:41:39,863 --> 00:41:42,761
It's a sewage recycling ship.

576
00:41:43,416 --> 00:41:45,993
The party line will be
that we're going for a scouting mission.

577
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,403
Looking for food.

578
00:41:49,325 --> 00:41:51,290
So you think I'm right.

579
00:41:51,656 --> 00:41:53,725
Maybe, maybe not.

580
00:41:54,739 --> 00:41:57,121
But I know she is, the President.

581
00:41:57,415 --> 00:41:59,533
She's been right all along.

582
00:41:59,969 --> 00:42:01,752
I'm tired of losing.

583
00:42:02,654 --> 00:42:05,790
I'm tired of turning away from
the things that I want to believe in.

584
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,111
And I believe you when you say

585
00:42:08,281 --> 00:42:10,736
that you'll die before you stop trying.

586
00:42:11,993 --> 00:42:14,182
And I won't lose you again.

587
00:42:16,385 --> 00:42:17,756
Now go.

588
00:42:19,284 --> 00:42:21,189
Find a way to Earth.

589
00:42:42,684 --> 00:42:46,392
