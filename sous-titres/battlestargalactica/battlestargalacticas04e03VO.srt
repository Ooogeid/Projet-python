00:00:20,173 --> 00:00:22,421
<i>Previously on</i> Battlestar Galactica...

2
00:00:23,186 --> 00:00:24,361
We're Cylons.

3
00:00:24,569 --> 00:00:26,323
And we have been from the start.

4
00:00:27,818 --> 00:00:29,333
It's time for a change.

5
00:00:29,776 --> 00:00:31,826
I've had some feelers
from the government.

6
00:00:31,987 --> 00:00:34,412
I think I could make a valuable
contribution there.

7
00:00:34,573 --> 00:00:35,955
I'm giving you a ship.

8
00:00:36,116 --> 00:00:38,021
Now go find a way to Earth.

9
00:00:38,308 --> 00:00:40,460
There are five other Cylons, brother.

10
00:00:40,715 --> 00:00:41,698
I saw them.

11
00:00:42,003 --> 00:00:43,046
Yes, we know.

12
00:00:43,296 --> 00:00:46,795
That's why we've decided
to box your entire line.

13
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:48,760
The telencephalic inhibitor

14
00:00:48,921 --> 00:00:51,509
that restricts higher functions
in the Centurions?

15
00:00:51,941 --> 00:00:54,099
- We had them removed.
- Say what?!

16
00:01:11,651 --> 00:01:13,190
Welcome back, brother.

17
00:01:15,188 --> 00:01:17,664
- What happened?
- You were shot, but you're with us now.

18
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:18,990
Shot by who?

19
00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:21,918
By our own Centurions.

20
00:01:24,414 --> 00:01:25,888
That's pure insanity.

21
00:01:26,174 --> 00:01:28,258
The Sixes have lost their minds.

22
00:01:28,418 --> 00:01:31,431
They have no idea of the threat
that they've unleashed.

23
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,638
I need to get to my ship.

24
00:01:34,133 --> 00:01:35,765
It's not your ship anymore.

25
00:01:35,925 --> 00:01:38,285
The Sixes and their acolytes
used their new pets

26
00:01:38,628 --> 00:01:40,662
to engage in a little ethnic cleansing.

27
00:01:40,782 --> 00:01:42,605
The fleet's split right down the middle.

28
00:01:42,766 --> 00:01:44,399
So much for my swing vote.

29
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,002
That'll teach me
not to trust in democracy.

30
00:02:31,912 --> 00:02:35,700
They can't possibly need you
every single hour, every single day.

31
00:02:35,861 --> 00:02:38,040
Can't you just tell someone
to fill in for you?

32
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,366
Who, Cally?
Who's gonna fill in for me?

33
00:02:40,486 --> 00:02:44,470
I don't know! Anyone can frakkin' turn
a wrench down there. There's not...

34
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:47,796
I'm the chief of the frak...
I've had enough of this.

35
00:03:02,322 --> 00:03:03,141
Yes!

36
00:03:06,417 --> 00:03:07,903
Dualla, it's me again.

37
00:03:08,265 --> 00:03:09,750
No, I know, I'm sorry.

38
00:03:11,877 --> 00:03:13,534
Can you please just check?

39
00:03:32,124 --> 00:03:33,550
<i>I used to know who I was.</i>

40
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:36,105
Galen Tyrol.

41
00:03:36,688 --> 00:03:38,723
Crew chief, husband,

42
00:03:39,468 --> 00:03:40,459
father.

43
00:03:43,217 --> 00:03:45,026
I look in the mirror nowadays,

44
00:03:46,222 --> 00:03:47,647
I don't even know what I am.

45
00:03:48,232 --> 00:03:50,309
Are you and Cally getting along?

46
00:04:03,281 --> 00:04:06,262
You know,
I never really liked ambrosia before.

47
00:04:08,922 --> 00:04:10,065
But now...

48
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:13,755
It's like I'm being flooded

49
00:04:13,917 --> 00:04:16,259
with new sensations and new feelings.

50
00:04:18,046 --> 00:04:19,333
Maybe you are too.

51
00:04:31,559 --> 00:04:33,464
In some ways, I don't hate this.

52
00:04:34,603 --> 00:04:37,841
Feeling new.
Feeling open to things.

53
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,860
To change.

54
00:04:40,522 --> 00:04:42,255
I don't do well with change.

55
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,488
Galen, you son of a...

56
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,559
Cally, come here.
Just give her some room.

57
00:05:01,679 --> 00:05:04,204
- Let go of me! Let go!
- Just listen to me for a second.

58
00:05:05,031 --> 00:05:06,307
Cally, listen to me.

<i>Love and Bullets</i>, by Nick Talo.

66
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:45,728
Chapter one.

67
00:06:46,852 --> 00:06:48,947
"It started like it always did.

68
00:06:50,428 --> 00:06:51,495
"With a body.

69
00:06:52,667 --> 00:06:54,400
"This one was in the river.

70
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,619
"I could tell
she had once been beautiful.

71
00:06:57,799 --> 00:07:01,502
"But this a bullet and fast current
had taken away from her.

72
00:07:02,462 --> 00:07:04,728
"All we are,
all that we think we are,

73
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:09,306
"all that we are certain about
is taken away from us.

74
00:07:11,135 --> 00:07:14,175
"When you've worked the streets
and seen what I've seen,

75
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,985
"you become more and more
convinced of it every day.

76
00:07:20,059 --> 00:07:23,487
"Caprica City had been my teacher,
my mistress.

77
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:26,841
"From the moment I open my eyes,

78
00:07:27,241 --> 00:07:29,489
"she's in my blood, like cheap wine...

79
00:07:30,156 --> 00:07:31,471
"bitter and sweet,

80
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,414
"tinged with regret.

81
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,025
"I'll never be free of her,

82
00:07:38,134 --> 00:07:39,582
"nor do I want to be.

83
00:07:41,012 --> 00:07:42,669
"For she is what I am.

84
00:07:44,126 --> 00:07:45,402
"All that is...

85
00:07:46,414 --> 00:07:47,802
"should always be."

86
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:52,033
I am grateful
and consistently inspired

87
00:07:52,153 --> 00:07:54,738
by the compassionate
and forthright leadership

88
00:07:54,858 --> 00:07:56,245
of President Roslin.

89
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,177
By the wisdom of my father,
whom some of you may know.

90
00:08:01,465 --> 00:08:04,512
And by the support and advice
of my valued friends.

91
00:08:04,872 --> 00:08:07,177
Some of whom,
you may be shocked to hear,

92
00:08:07,297 --> 00:08:08,555
are not Capricans.

93
00:08:10,106 --> 00:08:11,554
And so I am honored

94
00:08:11,674 --> 00:08:14,258
to accept this appointment
to the Quorum

95
00:08:14,782 --> 00:08:17,934
in the hope that I can continue
Delegate Cowan's courageous work

96
00:08:18,054 --> 00:08:20,711
on behalf of the people of Caprica
and the fleet.

97
00:08:20,871 --> 00:08:21,754
Thank you.

98
00:08:26,825 --> 00:08:29,929
Madam President,
by confirming Mr. Adama's nomination,

99
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,994
does it mean you don't have
any hard feelings

100
00:08:32,114 --> 00:08:34,136
about his role
in the Baltar trial?

101
00:08:35,136 --> 00:08:36,682
Thank you very much.

102
00:08:37,944 --> 00:08:41,335
Mr. Adama took on a cause
he felt was important.

103
00:08:41,678 --> 00:08:44,193
And I fully trust
he will continue to bring

104
00:08:44,354 --> 00:08:46,483
the same passion
and clear-mindedness

105
00:08:46,603 --> 00:08:48,614
in representing his constituents.

106
00:08:50,234 --> 00:08:51,927
- Yes?
- What about the Demetrius?

107
00:08:52,047 --> 00:08:55,079
The sewage recycling freighter
that jumped away three weeks ago.

108
00:08:55,585 --> 00:08:58,499
I will ask Admiral Adama
to answer that question.

109
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:01,107
The Demetrius is on a military mission.

110
00:09:01,537 --> 00:09:04,589
What about the rumor that Kara Thrace
was put in charge of that mission?

111
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:06,924
I don't comment on rumors.

112
00:09:15,037 --> 00:09:16,559
I'm gonna have to cut this short.

113
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,521
I will see you all very soon
at the Quorum Q&A. Thank you very much.

114
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,929
Frankly, I'm surprised
it took them this long

115
00:09:29,049 --> 00:09:31,247
to come after us about the Demetrius.

116
00:09:31,581 --> 00:09:33,097
Any luck and it'll blow over.

117
00:09:33,217 --> 00:09:35,453
It's not going to blow over.

118
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:39,231
I'm gonna be covering
for you for a long time on this.

119
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,632
I wanted to give Kara a chance.

120
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:44,378
I wanted to give myself
a chance to believe in her.

121
00:09:45,589 --> 00:09:46,702
Apparently.

122
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:02,179
You wanted to see me, Sir?

123
00:11:02,902 --> 00:11:04,465
I've made a decision.

124
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:12,633
Caps and recon runs.

125
00:11:12,753 --> 00:11:15,436
Okay, anyone want to remind me
what we're supposed to be looking for?

126
00:11:15,556 --> 00:11:17,185
Didn't you get the commander's memo?

127
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:19,306
It's a unique astronomic cluster.

128
00:11:19,468 --> 00:11:21,224
A system with a ringed gas giant,

129
00:11:21,409 --> 00:11:23,305
trinary star, and a comet.

130
00:11:23,665 --> 00:11:26,463
Astronomic cluster.
Sounds more like a cluster frak.

131
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:28,757
That's enough of that crap.

132
00:11:28,877 --> 00:11:30,292
Sorry, Sir, but you gotta admit

133
00:11:30,412 --> 00:11:33,289
it's starting to feel like
we're flying around in circles.

134
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,198
What's the latest, Felix?

135
00:11:36,807 --> 00:11:39,527
She's reversing course,
returning to sector seven.

136
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,499
That is the tenth course correction.

137
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:43,216
Did she give a reason this time?

138
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:46,478
A reason? Let's just say
I think she's steering with her gut.

139
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:48,361
Frak me.

140
00:11:49,371 --> 00:11:51,817
I'm telling you guys,
this thing is a setup anyway.

141
00:11:52,121 --> 00:11:55,369
You think that the old man just gave her
the ship and then cut her loose?

142
00:11:55,489 --> 00:11:57,478
I guarantee you
Galactica's dogging our every move,

143
00:11:57,598 --> 00:12:00,075
and they're waiting to jump in
as soon as she shows her true colors.

144
00:12:00,195 --> 00:12:01,908
You don't know
what you're talking about.

145
00:12:02,028 --> 00:12:04,076
- You gonna tell me what I know, rook?
- Yeah, maybe.

146
00:12:04,196 --> 00:12:05,416
I said to can it!

147
00:12:05,536 --> 00:12:06,721
All of you!

148
00:12:06,841 --> 00:12:08,606
Helo, I need to talk to you.

149
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:09,774
Now!

150
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:13,005
Who wants odds
on a course correction then?

151
00:12:19,225 --> 00:12:20,451
Kara, hey, listen.

152
00:12:20,743 --> 00:12:22,416
Some of us have been wondering

153
00:12:22,536 --> 00:12:25,636
about this trinary star formation
we're supposed to be looking for.

154
00:12:25,756 --> 00:12:27,665
Is there anything
else you can tell us about it?

155
00:12:27,785 --> 00:12:29,155
Any new data? Anything at all?

156
00:12:29,275 --> 00:12:31,670
You know everything
you need to know, ensign.

157
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:34,365
So stow the questions and do your job.

158
00:12:35,678 --> 00:12:36,555
Yes, Sir.

159
00:12:36,675 --> 00:12:39,136
- What's up, Captain?
- Helo, I have new jump coordinates.

160
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,181
Double check
the data file and the FTL drive.

161
00:12:42,301 --> 00:12:43,203
Got it?

162
00:12:56,906 --> 00:12:59,199
Cally, I told you last night

163
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:02,868
and I'm telling you again right now.
I am not having an affair.

164
00:13:03,676 --> 00:13:06,704
I went out for a drink.
I ran into Tory. We started talking.

165
00:13:06,918 --> 00:13:08,527
Look, I know how it looks,

166
00:13:08,647 --> 00:13:11,249
but it's completely innocent.
There's nothing to it.

167
00:13:24,093 --> 00:13:26,434
You'll have to drop Nicky off.
I have a doctor's appointment.

168
00:13:26,554 --> 00:13:28,720
Can you tell them
not to feed him any of that algae mash?

169
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,311
I think he's allergic.

170
00:13:32,342 --> 00:13:34,148
Just remember about the algae.

171
00:13:37,805 --> 00:13:40,466
No, I'm sorry. Daddy's sorry.

172
00:13:41,124 --> 00:13:42,949
Hey, come here. I'm sorry.

173
00:13:52,438 --> 00:13:55,592
I see you're still
cleaning up your mess.

174
00:13:55,863 --> 00:13:58,124
Oh, I hardly think
this qualifies as our mess.

175
00:13:58,293 --> 00:14:01,760
Well, I guess that explains why none
of you are lending a helping hand.

176
00:14:06,327 --> 00:14:07,377
Really, Six,

177
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:09,435
if you had wanted

178
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:11,496
some room to spread out,

179
00:14:12,534 --> 00:14:13,731
you could've just asked.

180
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:16,692
Is there anything
that isn't fodder for a joke with you?

181
00:14:16,853 --> 00:14:19,084
Or is that really
how you see our very existence?

182
00:14:19,272 --> 00:14:21,597
As some sort of nihilistic punch line?

183
00:14:21,717 --> 00:14:24,053
Nihilistic punch line? I like that.

184
00:14:25,121 --> 00:14:27,375
But quite honestly, I'm feeling...

185
00:14:27,495 --> 00:14:28,578
very serious.

186
00:14:28,789 --> 00:14:31,567
Getting riddled
with bullets affects me that way.

187
00:14:32,891 --> 00:14:34,251
But I want you all to know

188
00:14:34,412 --> 00:14:37,295
that I place the blame
for all of this squarely on myself.

189
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:38,860
Go on.

190
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,008
Well, you had legitimate concerns,
but I refused to hear them.

191
00:14:43,306 --> 00:14:44,825
But now I'm listening.

192
00:14:45,254 --> 00:14:48,598
So tell me, what's to be done to stop
all this and let us get back together?

193
00:14:48,774 --> 00:14:49,594
Well,

194
00:14:50,024 --> 00:14:51,106
for starters,

195
00:14:51,368 --> 00:14:53,186
you can stop lobotomizing the Raiders.

196
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:54,691
Done.

197
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:57,148
And you can agree to unbox the D'Annas.

198
00:14:57,453 --> 00:14:59,438
Resurrect her entire line?

199
00:14:59,812 --> 00:15:01,188
Don't forget, Six,

200
00:15:01,308 --> 00:15:04,726
it was D'Anna's messianic quest
for secrets better left alone

201
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:08,111
that started us down
this divisive path in the first place.

202
00:15:08,231 --> 00:15:10,550
You talk about restoring our unity.

203
00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:13,916
Well, we think it's time
to restore our greater unity.

204
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:15,773
To unite the 12 models

205
00:15:15,995 --> 00:15:17,289
once and for all.

206
00:15:18,331 --> 00:15:21,016
Well, I don't think
the others will accept this, but...

207
00:15:21,823 --> 00:15:23,132
I'll make your case.

208
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,354
Escort him off the ship.

209
00:15:32,857 --> 00:15:33,727
Please.

210
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:39,399
It's a good thing
you remembered the magic word.

211
00:15:41,704 --> 00:15:45,342
You're going to find you opened
a bigger can of worms than you realize.

212
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,408
Inspiring, isn't it?

213
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,562
A government of the people,
for the people,

214
00:16:30,177 --> 00:16:32,323
and answerable to the people.

215
00:16:32,612 --> 00:16:34,299
At least that's the idea.

216
00:16:37,169 --> 00:16:40,169
- I heard you tried to see her.
- I had some bills I wanted to discuss.

217
00:16:40,728 --> 00:16:43,615
Projects delegate Cowan
was pushing before she died.

218
00:16:44,854 --> 00:16:46,799
- But they told me she wasn't in.
- She was,

219
00:16:46,961 --> 00:16:48,212
just not for you.

220
00:16:49,327 --> 00:16:51,942
By standing up for Baltar,
you crossed the line with her.

221
00:16:52,062 --> 00:16:55,804
And Laura Roslin is not the type
to forgive and forget.

222
00:16:56,093 --> 00:16:58,170
She forgave you.
She made you vice President.

223
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:01,314
To keep me on the sidelines.
Same way she'll try to sideline you.

224
00:17:04,325 --> 00:17:05,444
Well, then...

225
00:17:05,605 --> 00:17:08,844
I'm intrigued. Why did you...
nominate me in the first place?

226
00:17:08,964 --> 00:17:10,783
Because you did stand up for Baltar.

227
00:17:10,944 --> 00:17:13,619
And you put Roslin
on the stand to do it.

228
00:17:14,026 --> 00:17:16,154
You weren't afraid
to ask some hard questions

229
00:17:16,274 --> 00:17:18,318
and to demand some honest answers.

230
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:21,210
Well, if you're looking for a repeat
performance, you're out of luck.

231
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:24,470
I didn't take this job to help you
undermine the President.

232
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:26,162
I'm not asking you to.

233
00:17:27,025 --> 00:17:28,346
Believe it or not,

234
00:17:28,686 --> 00:17:30,167
I'm on Laura's side.

235
00:17:30,714 --> 00:17:32,656
Okay, then what's the problem?

236
00:17:32,776 --> 00:17:35,969
It's amazing the things you start
to notice when you're on the sidelines,

237
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:39,192
how every decision
that Laura and your father make

238
00:17:39,312 --> 00:17:40,952
gets stamped "classified".

239
00:17:41,401 --> 00:17:44,662
Or how her directives
are starting to read like decrees,

240
00:17:44,782 --> 00:17:47,344
yet still get enacted
without so much as a debate.

241
00:17:47,896 --> 00:17:49,594
You know, she won't even allow

242
00:17:49,714 --> 00:17:52,757
records to be kept
of any of her meetings.

243
00:17:52,877 --> 00:17:54,598
Secrecy and control

244
00:17:55,127 --> 00:17:56,578
are becoming obsessions for her.

245
00:17:57,206 --> 00:18:00,332
I think this Demetrius business
is just the tip of the iceberg.

246
00:18:01,464 --> 00:18:02,710
Well, sometimes

247
00:18:03,464 --> 00:18:05,587
a benevolent tyrant's
exactly what you need.

248
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:06,790
No.

249
00:18:07,547 --> 00:18:09,817
A tyrant craves power for its own sake.

250
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,969
And all Laura wants

251
00:18:12,089 --> 00:18:13,889
is to save us all.

252
00:18:15,783 --> 00:18:16,853
Trust me.

253
00:18:17,384 --> 00:18:19,149
Better yet, trust yourself.

254
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:22,118
Because that's what
I'm really counting on.

255
00:18:22,238 --> 00:18:23,897
That you're not the kind of man

256
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:25,956
who can ignore the truth...

257
00:18:27,258 --> 00:18:28,977
when it stares you in the face.

258
00:18:45,968 --> 00:18:48,872
What if you gave me a sedative
and I just slept here?

259
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,590
Oh, sure.

260
00:18:50,928 --> 00:18:53,162
We'll just turn my sickbay
in an opium den

261
00:18:53,282 --> 00:18:55,031
so you can have a little snooze.

262
00:18:55,151 --> 00:18:57,881
Feels like I haven't had
a night's sleep since...

263
00:18:58,001 --> 00:19:00,011
we reached that frakkin' nebula.

264
00:19:01,088 --> 00:19:03,145
How are things on the home front?

265
00:19:04,587 --> 00:19:06,905
You mean other than catching my husband

266
00:19:07,025 --> 00:19:08,903
with another woman
and having him tell me

267
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:10,376
I'm imaging things?

268
00:19:10,892 --> 00:19:12,654
The man doesn't know
what he's got at home.

269
00:19:13,025 --> 00:19:14,876
Should have his head examined.

270
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:16,943
As a matter of fact,

271
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,743
why don't you bring him in?

272
00:19:19,268 --> 00:19:20,621
I'll take a look.

273
00:19:21,589 --> 00:19:24,792
See, that's what I like about you, Doc.
You just pretend to be a bastard.

274
00:19:25,351 --> 00:19:28,717
While you're in the mood for tough love,
maybe you are imaging things.

275
00:19:28,837 --> 00:19:31,468
You know, fatigue and antidepressants

276
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:33,534
can make a hell of a paranoia cocktail.

277
00:19:33,654 --> 00:19:37,339
I felt like I need to take something
to keep from going completely crazy.

278
00:19:37,731 --> 00:19:38,940
You're not crazy.

279
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:42,129
What would you call someone
who all but proposes to a man

280
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:43,806
after he breaks her jaw?

281
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:49,309
That the last time he laid hands on you?

282
00:19:52,587 --> 00:19:54,859
You want to hear something really sick?

283
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:57,449
Sometimes I wish he would.

284
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,243
Lay hands on me.

285
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:04,531
At least then I'd... I'd know
he had some feelings about me.

286
00:20:06,194 --> 00:20:08,967
Listen, just get some sleep
and clear your head.

287
00:20:10,089 --> 00:20:11,254
Will do, Doc.

288
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,150
Thank you.

289
00:20:37,996 --> 00:20:39,741
Kara, what the hell's
the matter with you?

290
00:20:42,029 --> 00:20:45,330
'Cause the way you're holing up in here,
you're making people wonder.

291
00:20:45,491 --> 00:20:46,468
Let 'em.

292
00:20:46,588 --> 00:20:49,592
Frankly, they're starting to bug me
as much as I bug them.

293
00:20:49,712 --> 00:20:50,669
Frak 'em.

294
00:20:50,965 --> 00:20:53,672
You know, some of us
actually volunteered for this mission.

295
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:56,961
Some meaning you?
Is that what this is about, Sam?

296
00:20:57,081 --> 00:20:59,906
You want to know what the deal
is with us? With our marriage?

297
00:21:00,026 --> 00:21:03,417
Well, it didn't make much sense
to begin with. Makes even less now.

298
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,516
Give me that.

299
00:21:07,006 --> 00:21:08,463
I don't buy that.

300
00:21:09,711 --> 00:21:13,035
I don't think you believe
a single frakkin' word you're saying.

301
00:21:13,588 --> 00:21:14,980
You're just scared.

302
00:21:17,411 --> 00:21:18,447
You see that?

303
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:20,848
You see this? You remember those?

304
00:21:20,968 --> 00:21:22,859
Do you remember when we got 'em?

305
00:21:23,422 --> 00:21:25,280
That's what's real.
That's part of who we are.

306
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,911
That is a part of who you are,
whether you want to admit it or not.

307
00:21:29,031 --> 00:21:30,649
You dumb motherfrakker.

308
00:21:31,273 --> 00:21:34,254
I only married you because it was safe
and it was easy, Sam.

309
00:21:35,152 --> 00:21:38,107
And you were just pathetic
enough to go along with it.

310
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:41,417
So get the frak out.

311
00:21:46,094 --> 00:21:47,377
I said get out.

312
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:48,785
Get out!

313
00:21:57,155 --> 00:21:58,922
I don't want to fight, Sam.

314
00:22:00,511 --> 00:22:01,773
I want to frak.

315
00:22:03,991 --> 00:22:05,645
You don't get it, do you?

316
00:22:05,912 --> 00:22:08,003
I'm not the same girl you married.

317
00:22:11,357 --> 00:22:13,579
All I want to do right now is frak.

318
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:16,929
Really frak, like it's the end
of the world and nothing else matters.

319
00:22:18,235 --> 00:22:19,484
So come on, Sam.

320
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,166
Make me feel something.

321
00:22:24,155 --> 00:22:25,371
I dare you.

322
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:40,956
We were married,

323
00:22:41,076 --> 00:22:42,151
weren't we?

324
00:22:42,777 --> 00:22:45,145
I mean, that wasn't just like a fantasy.

325
00:22:45,523 --> 00:22:46,523
Hell, no.

326
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,147
And I got the scars to prove it.

327
00:22:50,213 --> 00:22:52,494
Does that seem different to you somehow?

328
00:22:53,586 --> 00:22:54,751
Different how?

329
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,460
Not sure.

330
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:00,483
It's like everything seems so far away.

331
00:23:01,649 --> 00:23:04,027
The way things feel.
The way they taste.

332
00:23:05,523 --> 00:23:09,032
Like I'm watching myself, but
I'm not really experiencing it, not...

333
00:23:09,226 --> 00:23:10,643
... living it.

334
00:23:12,229 --> 00:23:16,036
Like my body's just this alien thing
that I'm still attached to.

335
00:23:18,452 --> 00:23:20,370
Does that seem crazy to you?

336
00:23:24,991 --> 00:23:27,109
Frankly,
we were as surprised as you are.

337
00:23:27,369 --> 00:23:29,611
We presented your case.
There was some debate.

338
00:23:30,229 --> 00:23:32,094
And we were outvoted.

339
00:23:32,264 --> 00:23:36,381
Our compatriots now seem to agree
that it was wrong to box the D'Annas.

340
00:23:37,026 --> 00:23:39,195
It sounds like your own opinion
hasn't changed.

341
00:23:39,365 --> 00:23:41,373
I promised that we'd do
some hard thinking.

342
00:23:42,459 --> 00:23:45,544
But in the end, we decided
that our choices were correct.

343
00:23:45,804 --> 00:23:49,006
Unfortunately, restoring unity
was all the others seemed to care about.

344
00:23:49,266 --> 00:23:53,010
It's hard to have unity when you're 
so opposed to everything we believe in.

345
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,822
Look, he kept his word.

346
00:23:54,992 --> 00:23:58,348
You won the day. Do you think you have
the right to win our hearts and minds?

347
00:23:58,608 --> 00:24:00,766
No, you're being presumptuous.

348
00:24:01,027 --> 00:24:02,978
- Don't compare us to...
- They're right.

349
00:24:03,238 --> 00:24:07,024
If they've agreed to our terms,  there's
no point in courting any more discord.

350
00:24:07,284 --> 00:24:09,693
Any more discord
and we may run out of spare bodies.

351
00:24:09,953 --> 00:24:11,438
The Three's core consciousness

352
00:24:11,608 --> 00:24:13,935
is being downloaded
at our central resurrection hub.

353
00:24:14,857 --> 00:24:18,493
The nearest accessible server
is a half dozen jumps from here.

354
00:24:18,871 --> 00:24:22,557
We can go together and hear
what your newfound heroine has to say.

355
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:24,291
If you don't mind,

356
00:24:24,949 --> 00:24:26,986
we'd prefer to stay on our own ships.

357
00:24:27,156 --> 00:24:28,295
By all means.

358
00:24:28,555 --> 00:24:31,298
I'd doubt that the rest of us
would feel comfortable here anyway.

359
00:24:36,003 --> 00:24:39,139
The chair recognizes
the delegate from Sagittaron.

360
00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:41,266
Would the President care to comment

361
00:24:41,526 --> 00:24:44,770
on the news stories crediting
so-called military sources

362
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:47,588
that claim the Demetrius
is searching for new food sources?

363
00:24:47,758 --> 00:24:50,228
Or, Madame President,
would you rather that we just

364
00:24:50,398 --> 00:24:53,153
simply accept
this obvious attempt at disinformation?

365
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:58,656
Order, please.

366
00:24:59,169 --> 00:25:00,952
I'm afraid I don't control the media,

367
00:25:01,212 --> 00:25:03,038
Jacob, as much as you know I'd love to.

368
00:25:03,298 --> 00:25:04,539
Regarding the reports,

369
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,995
the Demetrius mission
is a matter of fleet security,

370
00:25:07,165 --> 00:25:09,296
and as such
I can't and won't discuss it, period.

371
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:12,982
Madame President, I have to say
that my constituency is not satisfied...

372
00:25:13,152 --> 00:25:14,828
Do you realize this casts doubt

373
00:25:14,998 --> 00:25:17,385
on something
as fundamental as our route to Earth?

374
00:25:18,157 --> 00:25:21,723
Yes, but don't take my "yes"
to imply that the rumors are true.

375
00:25:21,983 --> 00:25:25,393
- Madame President!
- Jacob, Aaron, everyone, please.

376
00:25:25,653 --> 00:25:28,313
I can not believe that the Demetrius

377
00:25:28,573 --> 00:25:30,816
is the only matter
that is important to your constituents.

378
00:25:31,076 --> 00:25:33,401
Can we please move on?
You know my answer to this.

379
00:25:33,975 --> 00:25:35,933
You can tell your free trade deal
good-bye.

380
00:25:36,103 --> 00:25:37,280
You can kiss my ass.

381
00:25:43,713 --> 00:25:44,746
Order, please.

382
00:25:45,382 --> 00:25:46,527
Order!

383
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:50,128
Madame President,
I'm sure we can all understand

384
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:52,481
the importance
for the need for security.

385
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:56,133
Coming from the military,
it's my experience that we sometimes err

386
00:25:56,393 --> 00:25:58,718
too strongly on the side of caution.

387
00:25:58,978 --> 00:26:01,054
So, for the sake
of reassuring my colleagues

388
00:26:01,314 --> 00:26:04,224
and hopefully
putting this matter to rest,

389
00:26:04,484 --> 00:26:08,103
would it not be fair to say
that you and Admiral Adama

390
00:26:08,363 --> 00:26:11,523
are naturally exploring
all possible routes to Earth?

391
00:26:12,344 --> 00:26:15,985
Hear, hear. Now we're getting focus.
That's exactly what we need.

392
00:26:16,517 --> 00:26:18,777
Mr. Adama, we are all anxious

393
00:26:18,947 --> 00:26:21,605
to receive
the benefit of your experience.

394
00:26:21,929 --> 00:26:22,909
But,

395
00:26:23,169 --> 00:26:25,204
I personally don't feel the need

396
00:26:25,374 --> 00:26:27,998
to have a junior delegate
appoint himself my spokesman.

397
00:26:28,258 --> 00:26:29,937
Let's move on. Jacob,

398
00:26:30,107 --> 00:26:32,794
you had a matter on the table.
Would you please continue?

399
00:26:33,054 --> 00:26:35,714
Thank you, Madame President.
My constituents

400
00:26:36,049 --> 00:26:38,675
- are having problems obtaining...
- Point of order.

401
00:26:38,935 --> 00:26:41,715
Now, I have prepared
a report that I think we...

402
00:26:43,203 --> 00:26:46,153
- Point of order, mister Vice President.
- Excuse me. Hello?

403
00:26:47,886 --> 00:26:49,144
Order, please!

404
00:26:49,404 --> 00:26:50,585
Order, please!

405
00:26:50,755 --> 00:26:53,190
Thank you very, very much. Mr. Cantrell,

406
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,442
- will you yield the floor?
- I will yield.

407
00:26:56,058 --> 00:26:57,477
Thank you.

408
00:26:59,362 --> 00:27:02,565
This relates
to your executive order 112.

409
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,544
112.

410
00:27:05,714 --> 00:27:08,321
Which establishes a system of tribunals.

411
00:27:08,631 --> 00:27:10,498
The judges are chosen by you.

412
00:27:10,952 --> 00:27:13,739
Answerable
only to a special court of appeals,

413
00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:16,504
the judges of which
would also be chosen by you.

414
00:27:16,942 --> 00:27:19,635
Effectively it creates
a justice system that further

415
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:23,303
and dangerously concentrates power
into the hands of the executive.

416
00:27:23,563 --> 00:27:25,555
Namely, into your hands,
Madame President.

417
00:27:25,815 --> 00:27:28,362
Far from being independent or impartial,

418
00:27:28,824 --> 00:27:30,268
it would actually damage

419
00:27:30,528 --> 00:27:33,497
the very idea of justice. Even
the illusion of the idea of justice.

420
00:27:33,667 --> 00:27:36,260
Thank you, Mr. Adama.
And the order you're referring to,

421
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:39,561
executive order 112,
is actually a work in progress,

422
00:27:39,731 --> 00:27:42,405
and the changes it proposes
are provisional.

423
00:27:42,665 --> 00:27:45,408
It is a first step,
a tiny step, but the first step

424
00:27:45,668 --> 00:27:47,827
in a... in a larger plan,

425
00:27:48,087 --> 00:27:50,926
actually, to create a fair
and comprehensive legal system,

426
00:27:51,096 --> 00:27:53,583
which you of all people
can admit we sorely need.

427
00:27:53,845 --> 00:27:55,877
Now naturally I was going to bring it

428
00:27:56,137 --> 00:27:59,256
to the Quorum to open it up for debate
once it was finished, which it isn't.

429
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,925
But since you've brought it
into the public today,

430
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,746
I propose that we put it on the dock

431
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:07,055
for the next full session.

432
00:28:07,315 --> 00:28:09,390
Is that satisfactory to you, Mr. Adama?

433
00:28:29,138 --> 00:28:31,318
The resurrection ship
didn't make the jump.

434
00:28:31,488 --> 00:28:34,251
- Problem with their FTL?
- No report.

435
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:48,566
Now Cavil's baseships
are breaking formation,

436
00:28:48,736 --> 00:28:51,086
taking positions around our periphery.

437
00:28:51,636 --> 00:28:53,387
They're going to attack.

438
00:28:54,111 --> 00:28:56,854
Alert the others!
We need to jump now.

439
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,774
- They've taken out our FTL!
- No resurrection ship.

440
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:02,388
They're trying to kill us.

441
00:29:15,063 --> 00:29:16,263
Just remember...

442
00:29:17,737 --> 00:29:18,987
They started it.

443
00:29:23,949 --> 00:29:25,299
But we're killing them.

444
00:29:26,549 --> 00:29:28,299
We're truly killing them.

445
00:29:28,813 --> 00:29:30,112
My own sisters.

446
00:29:30,985 --> 00:29:34,391
They can trust their God
to watch over their immortal souls.

447
00:29:34,795 --> 00:29:36,227
And what about ours?

448
00:29:38,237 --> 00:29:40,187
We're machines, dear, remember?

449
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:42,248
We don't have souls.

450
00:32:13,876 --> 00:32:15,626
<i>Now I've heard everything.</i>

451
00:32:16,408 --> 00:32:18,940
<i>Anders and Gaius frakkin' Baltar.</i>

452
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:24,242
<i>- ... Cylon nymphomaniac.
- Don't worry, Colonel.</i>

453
00:32:24,412 --> 00:32:26,396
<i>- You're not my type.
- And one more thing.</i>

454
00:32:27,062 --> 00:32:30,205
From now on we only meet in private
after that scene you two pulled

455
00:32:30,375 --> 00:32:33,153
in Joe's bar the other night,
we can't risk any more attention.

456
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,990
- Fine, great. We done, can we go?
- Why are you so antsy?

457
00:32:37,251 --> 00:32:38,647
I told Cally I'd check on her.

458
00:32:38,817 --> 00:32:41,082
Well, didn't you do that
when you got my note?

459
00:32:41,252 --> 00:32:42,287
What note?

460
00:32:42,549 --> 00:32:46,199
The note I left in the drop
in your quarters about this meeting.

461
00:32:46,503 --> 00:32:49,587
Tory found me. Did you... Frak me.

462
00:32:49,848 --> 00:32:52,395
- If Cally finds the note then...
- You better hope she doesn't.

463
00:32:52,565 --> 00:32:55,332
And you better put an end
to this affair business.

464
00:32:55,502 --> 00:32:57,679
Whatever it takes
to stop her from nosing around.

465
00:32:57,939 --> 00:33:00,519
Last thing we need
is for your Cylon-hating wife

466
00:33:00,689 --> 00:33:03,642
to find out there's a bunch of skinjobs
running around this ship

467
00:33:04,187 --> 00:33:05,852
and that her husband is one of them.

468
00:33:47,564 --> 00:33:50,014
I'm tired of looking
at your sorry faces.

469
00:34:34,963 --> 00:34:36,193
Frak! Frak!

470
00:34:52,511 --> 00:34:53,835
How you doing?

471
00:34:55,441 --> 00:34:56,343
Fine.

472
00:35:00,061 --> 00:35:01,602
You feeling okay?

473
00:35:01,813 --> 00:35:03,063
Yeah, I'm fine.

474
00:35:06,908 --> 00:35:07,767
Sure?

475
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,330
Yeah, actually, I am.

476
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,021
Thought I was coming down
with something, so I slept in.

477
00:35:16,772 --> 00:35:19,569
- Did you go see Cottle?
- No, I'm feeling better.

478
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,240
Good.

479
00:35:26,922 --> 00:35:29,814
Look, I know it's been
a rough couple of weeks.

480
00:35:30,715 --> 00:35:32,599
I know what you're thinking.

481
00:35:34,001 --> 00:35:35,151
It's not true.

482
00:35:35,501 --> 00:35:36,556
It isn't?

483
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:38,340
No.

484
00:35:41,552 --> 00:35:43,375
I'm not having an affair.

485
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,666
I figured it out.
I know what's important.

486
00:35:48,025 --> 00:35:49,234
You're important.

487
00:35:50,903 --> 00:35:52,520
Nicky's important.

488
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,355
We're important. Us.

489
00:35:55,189 --> 00:35:58,859
That's really what it's all about,
isn't it? A family, a future.

490
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,278
Building that future together.

491
00:36:01,539 --> 00:36:03,405
I promise you from now on

492
00:36:03,666 --> 00:36:06,106
I will be here for us.

493
00:36:06,669 --> 00:36:08,244
The three of us.

494
00:36:08,505 --> 00:36:10,055
Maybe the four of us.

495
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:13,750
You know, maybe someday

496
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:16,669
we'll have another baby.

497
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,964
What do you think? Another baby?

498
00:36:21,542 --> 00:36:23,938
A brother, a sister for little Nick?

499
00:36:27,398 --> 00:36:29,682
Would you like
a little brother or sister?

500
00:38:51,753 --> 00:38:52,723
Cally!

501
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:56,620
Stay the frak away from me!
I know what you are!

502
00:38:56,882 --> 00:38:58,204
I know what all of you are.

503
00:38:58,466 --> 00:39:00,749
How could you?
We don't even know what we are.

504
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:02,751
I heard you. You're Cylons!

505
00:39:03,013 --> 00:39:06,296
- A bunch of frakkin'skinjobs.
- I wish it were that simple.

506
00:39:06,573 --> 00:39:08,776
I told you to stay away from me.

507
00:39:13,397 --> 00:39:16,793
I guess you better hope
there's a spare body waiting for you.

508
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:21,877
You want to kill me?

509
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,439
Go ahead.

510
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:26,191
Don't do this to yourself
or to your child.

511
00:39:28,371 --> 00:39:30,548
- To Nicky.
- Get the frak away!

512
00:39:30,718 --> 00:39:33,231
You're not getting your hands on my son!

513
00:39:34,134 --> 00:39:36,415
Not you or not Galen!

514
00:39:37,672 --> 00:39:40,538
- He frakkin' used me!
- He didn't know.

515
00:39:41,196 --> 00:39:42,446
None of us did.

516
00:39:44,377 --> 00:39:46,419
We didn't find out
until we entered that nebula.

517
00:39:46,681 --> 00:39:49,247
Just shut the frak up, triggered!

518
00:39:50,754 --> 00:39:53,551
All we know is that we're Cylons.

519
00:39:54,007 --> 00:39:55,955
But in every other way,

520
00:39:56,649 --> 00:39:59,593
- we're still the same people.
- You're frakkin' machines!

521
00:40:02,361 --> 00:40:03,565
I don't know.

522
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,733
But I do know that we're not evil.

523
00:40:09,697 --> 00:40:10,944
We're not inhuman.

524
00:40:11,758 --> 00:40:13,208
And we're just as

525
00:40:13,582 --> 00:40:16,303
scared and confused as you are.

526
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:18,387
I can't live like this!

527
00:40:18,885 --> 00:40:20,819
It's a frakkin' nightmare.

528
00:40:21,511 --> 00:40:23,685
You don't want to do this, Cally.

529
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,333
He's your son.

530
00:40:33,795 --> 00:40:36,220
What have I done? I'm so sorry.

531
00:40:42,791 --> 00:40:44,229
It's okay...

532
00:40:47,184 --> 00:40:48,745
It's gonna be okay.

533
00:40:51,593 --> 00:40:53,626
Let's just get out of here.

534
00:40:53,796 --> 00:40:54,746
It's okay.

535
00:40:54,916 --> 00:40:56,573
We'll work this out together.

536
00:40:56,985 --> 00:40:57,935
It's okay.

537
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:01,139
Okay.

538
00:41:02,977 --> 00:41:04,460
Here. Let me take him.

539
00:42:49,573 --> 00:42:52,318
