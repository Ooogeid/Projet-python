<i>Previously on</i>
Battlestar Galactica...

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,903
- What about the FTL question?
- It's possible.

3
00:00:06,071 --> 00:00:08,799
It's labor intensive.
Lotta grunt work but we should be able

4
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:12,345
to upgrade the jump drives of
the entire fleet with Cylon technology.

5
00:00:12,807 --> 00:00:14,750
Not gonna be easy to sell
the Quorum on this one.

6
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:16,974
Question has been called.
All in favor.

7
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:19,749
All opposed.
The vote is 11 to 1. Motion carries.

8
00:00:19,874 --> 00:00:23,878
No Cylon will board a ship in this fleet
without permission of its people.

9
00:00:24,665 --> 00:00:27,771
Ten of our ships refuse a direct order
from the flagship.

10
00:00:27,896 --> 00:00:30,154
Another 12 won't even respond
to our hails.

11
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:31,614
That's not illegal.

12
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:34,241
Jump drive upgrades
is a military decision.

13
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,452
And you alone get to make
that determination?

14
00:00:36,763 --> 00:00:37,953
Yes, Mr. Gaeta.

15
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,818
Do you have a problem with that?

16
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:43,376
Tylium ship's pulling out of formation.
They're spinning up their FTL drives.

17
00:00:44,314 --> 00:00:45,670
Hitei Kan has jumped away.

18
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:47,838
Taking all our fuel with them.

19
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,884
You think I know
where the tylium ship is?

20
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,260
I know that you do.

21
00:00:55,238 --> 00:00:57,035
<i>Hitei Kan, this is Athena.</i>

22
00:00:57,331 --> 00:00:58,981
<i>Stand by to be boarded.</i>

23
00:00:59,396 --> 00:01:00,747
The world is frakked.

24
00:01:00,872 --> 00:01:03,274
It's upside down and somebody's
gotta turn it right side up.

25
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:05,849
- Are you that man?
- I'm one of them.

26
00:01:06,151 --> 00:01:08,845
- I need a partner.
- You've got one.

27
00:01:10,824 --> 00:01:13,524
Every revolution begins
with one small act.

28
00:01:14,013 --> 00:01:15,491
Somebody close that hatch.

29
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:16,708
Let's talk.

30
00:01:33,798 --> 00:01:35,648
It's fresh. You want a cup?

31
00:01:35,773 --> 00:01:39,181
Ever since they started grinding it
out of algae I've lost the taste.

32
00:01:39,928 --> 00:01:43,188
We got three more
civilian captains pitching fits,

33
00:01:43,313 --> 00:01:46,213
refusing to allow
the Cylon engineers on board.

34
00:01:46,454 --> 00:01:48,190
I thought we settled that
2 days ago.

35
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,590
Well, the tylium ship
didn't get the message.

36
00:01:50,715 --> 00:01:53,311
They're screamin' bloody murder
to anyone who'll listen,

37
00:01:53,436 --> 00:01:57,514
claiming they're being
illegally seized by our marines.

38
00:01:58,331 --> 00:01:59,731
I'm tired of this.

39
00:02:00,863 --> 00:02:01,787
Go to Lee.

40
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:04,467
Tell the Quorum that if they don't
get their ships in line,

41
00:02:04,737 --> 00:02:07,084
they can all share a blanket
in Zarek's cell.

42
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:10,212
- I'll make the call, but...
- Smells good.

43
00:02:12,119 --> 00:02:13,369
Hello, Colonel.

44
00:02:14,747 --> 00:02:16,897
- Madam President.
- How's it going?

45
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,115
You were saying, Saul?

46
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:25,678
It's just...

47
00:02:28,117 --> 00:02:31,997
Given the fleet's mood
toward Cylons...

48
00:02:34,186 --> 00:02:37,114
You might not want me
taking point on this.

49
00:02:38,619 --> 00:02:39,950
I'll be up there in a minute.

50
00:02:53,247 --> 00:02:54,507
Mr. Vice President.

51
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:02,643
Rumors are already starting to spread.
Good luck keeping the lid on.

52
00:03:02,768 --> 00:03:04,350
The fleet's the least of my worries.

53
00:03:17,717 --> 00:03:19,114
You're clear, sir.

54
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,710
Connor called in. We're good to go
with the small arms locker.

55
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:24,885
- C deck?
- Narcho and Paley. They're all over it.

56
00:03:29,423 --> 00:03:30,873
Move out, Corporal.

57
00:03:33,066 --> 00:03:35,029
Our biggest problem
is still the Quorum.

58
00:03:35,154 --> 00:03:37,174
You can isolate them
for a few hours, but...

59
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:40,060
They'll huff and puff,
but reality will trump

60
00:03:40,185 --> 00:03:42,684
their sense of duty soon enough,
with one exception.

61
00:03:42,809 --> 00:03:45,171
- We've been through this.
- He's a wild card.

62
00:03:45,296 --> 00:03:47,446
Talkin' about the Admiral's son.

63
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:51,141
Well, push his buttons.
I hear you're good at that.

64
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,483
The Colonel's right, you know.

65
00:03:56,262 --> 00:04:00,703
The fleet has never been comfortable
with this blanket Cylon amnesty.

66
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,590
This coffee is terrible.

67
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:07,535
Siccing Lee on the Quorum is only
gonna be seen as a shot across the bow.

68
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,052
He can hedge it all he wants,
but the delegates will see it comes

69
00:04:10,177 --> 00:04:12,668
- straight from you.
- Well, Lee can handle it.

70
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,736
Yes, he can, and so can you.

71
00:04:15,391 --> 00:04:17,341
And I'm not getting involved.

72
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,729
So he can take care of himself
and you can take care of yourself...

73
00:04:22,285 --> 00:04:24,635
And I am not getting pulled back in.

74
00:04:29,796 --> 00:04:30,796
Yeah.

75
00:04:32,113 --> 00:04:34,013
The legendary Adama silence.

76
00:04:34,369 --> 00:04:35,941
I can see right through it.

77
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,474
This passive-aggressive pretense
that you are okay

78
00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:41,299
if I don't get involved.

79
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,771
I don't do passive-aggressive.

80
00:04:43,896 --> 00:04:46,688
Yes, you do.
You just don't know that's what it is.

81
00:04:49,968 --> 00:04:50,968
Well...

82
00:04:53,149 --> 00:04:54,209
Get some rest.

83
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:57,254
- Rest ?
- I'll try to make it home for supper.

84
00:04:57,603 --> 00:04:59,053
I'll have it ready.

85
00:05:02,963 --> 00:05:04,595
Cantrell's the key. Tell Lee.

86
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,639
If he can get to Cantr...

87
00:05:09,455 --> 00:05:10,455
I'm not.

88
00:05:28,853 --> 00:05:31,747
Son of a bitch!
I got a fuel leak over here!

89
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:33,928
Frakkin' spark will blow
the whole place.

90
00:05:34,275 --> 00:05:36,961
You guys. I need all of you
to clear the deck now.

91
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,420
Now!

92
00:05:47,368 --> 00:05:48,428
Sitrep, Lieutenant.

93
00:05:48,553 --> 00:05:51,729
Raptor's transponder's down
for the count, and LSO's good to go.

94
00:05:51,854 --> 00:05:53,054
What the hell?

95
00:05:53,647 --> 00:05:55,509
What are you doing?
This ship's on hold

96
00:05:55,634 --> 00:05:59,316
for an emergency medical transport,
not some bogus, VIP shuttle.

97
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:02,867
Sorry,, I assumed the LSO called it in.
This bird's been cleared for launch.

98
00:06:02,992 --> 00:06:04,488
No, I didn't get the order.

99
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:08,015
New mission takes priority.
The admiral believes that Zarek

100
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,470
may have an attempt on his life
here on Galactica.

101
00:06:10,595 --> 00:06:13,159
Given the Vice President's
controversial status,

102
00:06:13,284 --> 00:06:15,437
he's being transferred
to Colonial One.

103
00:06:15,604 --> 00:06:18,204
All right.
Soon as I confirm it with CIC.

104
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,213
You have confirmation.
Laird...

105
00:06:23,514 --> 00:06:25,342
The Admiral
doesn't want this leaking out.

106
00:06:25,951 --> 00:06:27,720
I'm sorry
I can't take your word for it.

107
00:06:37,108 --> 00:06:40,024
Well, good riddance.
Frakker's been up Adama's ass

108
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:42,549
since he transferred in
from Pegasus.

109
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,163
- He won't be the last.
- Get on that ship.

110
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:55,758
- Not yet.
- I need you...

111
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:57,166
I know what you need.

112
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,764
I also know a little
about revolution, Mr. Gaeta.

113
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:02,046
Success doesn't hinge
on some grand operatic ideal

114
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:04,971
or the will of the people.
It hangs in the cumulative moments,

115
00:07:05,096 --> 00:07:07,197
each one building on the next,
and it could be lost

116
00:07:07,322 --> 00:07:09,094
with the slightest hesitation.

117
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,805
I started this,
and I'll see it through.

118
00:07:12,177 --> 00:07:14,227
Now get on that frakkin' ship.

Colonel Tigh, sitrep.

124
00:08:21,842 --> 00:08:22,892
Cap is out.

125
00:08:23,725 --> 00:08:25,775
Dradis shows no enemy contacts.

126
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:29,477
Fleet's still jacked up
on Zarek's anti-Cylon bull.

127
00:08:30,444 --> 00:08:34,013
Lee's giving the Quorum a shove,
but it'd take a cavity search

128
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:36,738
to find the backbone
in that sorry bunch.

129
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:43,438
I'm showing a launch, but we don't
have anything listed in the flight log.

130
00:08:44,335 --> 00:08:47,202
Laird probably rescheduled
and it didn't make it into the system.

131
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:49,427
See if you can find the update.

132
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:58,098
I've got Nowart rounding up every marine
that can still pull a trigger.

133
00:08:58,223 --> 00:09:02,227
So if you get fed up playing chicken
with these bastards, say the word.

134
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:04,376
Hitei Kan was a special case.

135
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,853
We have to shoot up
every ship we go into,

136
00:09:06,978 --> 00:09:09,228
you can kiss this alliance goodbye.

137
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:13,839
Nothing. I better call down
to the deck just to make sure.

138
00:09:13,964 --> 00:09:15,565
Yeah, hold up.
Is that your launch?

139
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,351
Because I'm not seeing
a squawk code.

140
00:09:17,476 --> 00:09:18,891
Is there a problem?

141
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:21,292
We've got an unidentified contact
off the flight deck.

142
00:09:21,417 --> 00:09:23,604
No transponder ID.
I'm thinking dradis ghost.

143
00:09:24,101 --> 00:09:25,287
Last thing I need.

144
00:09:25,412 --> 00:09:27,101
Four years without a pit stop.

145
00:09:27,226 --> 00:09:29,242
Equipment's sketchy as hell.

146
00:09:29,721 --> 00:09:33,475
Mr. Gaeta,
order a full diagnostic on dradis.

147
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,947
Yes, sir, right away.

148
00:09:38,698 --> 00:09:40,495
Order, order!

149
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,726
I remind you once again
that Mr. Zarek

150
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:47,853
was taken into custody
because he was agitating

151
00:09:47,978 --> 00:09:49,755
against a lawful order.

152
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,788
Now, these Cylon FTL drives
are essential

153
00:09:53,913 --> 00:09:56,223
if the fleet is going to move on.

154
00:10:03,191 --> 00:10:04,608
Mr. Vice President.

155
00:10:05,067 --> 00:10:06,889
Don't look so surprised, Lee.

156
00:10:07,172 --> 00:10:10,150
Even your father knows
when he's holding a losing hand.

157
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:12,084
I'll take it.

158
00:10:29,073 --> 00:10:31,155
Yeah, I used to be pretty good
at this game.

159
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,340
Oh, yeah?

160
00:10:34,328 --> 00:10:35,600
Makin' the shot.

161
00:10:36,547 --> 00:10:38,113
Winnin' the big game.

162
00:10:38,985 --> 00:10:41,342
Can't believe
that used to matter to me.

163
00:10:42,961 --> 00:10:44,956
That life back in the Colonies...

164
00:10:46,672 --> 00:10:48,355
It's like a dream to me now.

165
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:51,729
And the further away we get...

166
00:10:55,108 --> 00:10:58,733
Gods, I remember you
and me back at Joe's bar,

167
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:01,327
slammin' drinks, shootin' pyramid.

168
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,365
Those were good times.

169
00:11:06,696 --> 00:11:08,344
They were, weren't they?

170
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:13,797
I really... I really thought there was
somethin' between us, you know?

171
00:11:14,233 --> 00:11:17,255
And when that didn't happen,
I wondered, "Was it me?"

172
00:11:18,109 --> 00:11:21,013
- No, Diana, I was...
- You know, now I'm thinkin' no.

173
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:23,451
Maybe it was somethin' else.

174
00:11:24,535 --> 00:11:25,641
Some Cylon thing.

175
00:11:26,376 --> 00:11:27,483
Your programming.

176
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,189
Gods, I know it's been months,
but I just can't let it go.

177
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:42,743
Cool it! Save it!

178
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:46,125
We got him.

179
00:11:55,209 --> 00:11:56,209
Save it.

180
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,105
Private Jaffe.

181
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,294
Log this.

182
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:04,919
Yes, sir.

183
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:11,734
I'm getting a fire warning on deck C
near the main antenna array.

184
00:12:11,859 --> 00:12:14,423
Order the damage
control team to C deck.

185
00:12:14,548 --> 00:12:16,985
Have them report back to me
with their assessment ASAP.

186
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,110
Yes, sir.

187
00:12:19,795 --> 00:12:21,723
Admiral, if the wireless array
goes down,

188
00:12:21,848 --> 00:12:24,297
we could lose communications
across the fleet.

189
00:12:24,422 --> 00:12:25,952
Given our current situation,

190
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,607
I'm thinking this fire
might not be an accident.

191
00:12:28,732 --> 00:12:30,915
Zarek's true believers
would have a field day

192
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,292
if we went dark.

193
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:35,922
Very well.

194
00:12:36,796 --> 00:12:39,623
Have the marine fire unit
accompany the DC party

195
00:12:39,748 --> 00:12:42,921
and prepare an evacuation
of all personnel from C deck.

196
00:12:43,046 --> 00:12:44,046
Yes, sir.

197
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:51,691
Look at you, the proud papa.

198
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,047
When I named you Hotdog,
I sure as hell got that right.

199
00:12:55,172 --> 00:12:57,710
- Knock it off.
- Come on, don't be shy.

200
00:12:58,071 --> 00:13:01,071
There had to have been other conquests
for the great Brendan Constanza.

201
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:04,698
And you frakked half the fleet.
What do you have to show for it?

202
00:13:17,918 --> 00:13:20,168
<i>Attention... Fire in compartment C.</i>

203
00:13:20,293 --> 00:13:22,842
<i>Evacuate sections 29 through 42.</i>

204
00:13:25,718 --> 00:13:26,718
Narcho.

205
00:13:27,402 --> 00:13:30,786
You heard the alarm, Captain.
Evac the area. I'm in charge here.

206
00:13:31,216 --> 00:13:33,733
Since when did they put pilots
in charge of damage control?

207
00:13:33,858 --> 00:13:36,565
- Hey, I'm talkin'...
- Take your frakkin' hands off me.

208
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,150
Gods.

209
00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:40,642
Nobody even knows
what you are anymore.

210
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,670
Son of a bitch.

211
00:13:51,544 --> 00:13:53,790
Grab as much as you can carry
and get up to the hangar deck.

212
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,231
You, take those four people
on D deck.

213
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,652
Anybody asks any questions,
you tell 'em it's routine,

214
00:14:00,777 --> 00:14:01,882
Admiral's orders.

215
00:14:16,891 --> 00:14:17,927
<i>Gaeta, CIC.</i>

216
00:14:18,052 --> 00:14:19,759
This is Starbuck,
get me the Admiral now.

217
00:14:19,884 --> 00:14:21,028
He's busy, Captain.

218
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:24,378
Gods damn it, we've got civilians
arming themselves down here!

219
00:14:41,153 --> 00:14:42,280
<i>Gaeta, CIC.</i>

220
00:14:42,516 --> 00:14:44,674
This is Lee Adama.
Get my father on the line.

221
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:47,452
I'm sorry, Lee, we're having
a bit of an emergency right now.

222
00:14:47,577 --> 00:14:48,728
<i>Is it serious?</i>

223
00:14:49,141 --> 00:14:50,830
Nothing damage control can't handle,

224
00:14:50,955 --> 00:14:52,682
but you know the Admiral.

225
00:14:53,015 --> 00:14:55,266
Yeah, well, I thought I did.
Well, maybe you can help.

226
00:14:55,391 --> 00:14:58,015
Do you have any idea
why Tom Zarek was released?

227
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,890
Released, when?

228
00:15:00,015 --> 00:15:01,392
<i>That's just perfect.</i>

229
00:15:01,517 --> 00:15:03,193
<i>He tells me to threaten
the delegates,</i>

230
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:05,436
then he blindsides me
by giving Zarek a pass.

231
00:15:05,561 --> 00:15:06,980
<i>Doesn't make sense to me either.</i>

232
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:10,158
As soon as your father gets back,
I'll be sure that he knows you called.

233
00:15:16,034 --> 00:15:17,813
Problems on the home front?

234
00:15:19,468 --> 00:15:22,958
I have to say, Lee, you don't seem
particularly happy to see me.

235
00:15:24,806 --> 00:15:26,237
I'm glad you're out.

236
00:15:27,763 --> 00:15:30,481
My father overreached
when he had you arrested.

237
00:15:31,366 --> 00:15:33,713
But I hope you changed your mind
about the Cylon FTLs.

238
00:15:33,838 --> 00:15:35,370
We need those drives.

239
00:15:35,828 --> 00:15:37,656
At least the Admiral thinks we do.

240
00:15:37,781 --> 00:15:40,994
Problem with you is
that you're tryin' to have it both ways.

241
00:15:41,119 --> 00:15:43,390
Honor thy father
or be true to your oath

242
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,670
as the Caprican representative.

243
00:15:46,138 --> 00:15:47,904
At some point the two don't mix.

244
00:15:48,965 --> 00:15:51,003
Do you know why he released me?

245
00:15:52,705 --> 00:15:56,178
Because I'm only a threat
if he recognizes a civilian authority.

246
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,580
Afraid our experiment in democracy
is about to end.

247
00:16:00,205 --> 00:16:02,919
Adama entertained it until now
because of Roslin.

248
00:16:03,389 --> 00:16:05,807
But since she abdicated
the throne...

249
00:16:06,528 --> 00:16:07,844
He wouldn't do that.

250
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:10,885
Really?
Because he did it before.

251
00:16:11,948 --> 00:16:13,704
Tell me, what excuse
did he give this time

252
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:15,682
when he refused to take your call?

253
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:23,841
- You're leaving.
- For Galactica, to prove you wrong.

254
00:16:27,641 --> 00:16:29,442
Sir, we just lost
communications ship-wide.

255
00:16:29,567 --> 00:16:31,543
- Switch to secondaries.
- They're a no-go.

256
00:16:31,668 --> 00:16:33,974
Backups are down as well.
And the fire seems to be escalating.

257
00:16:34,099 --> 00:16:36,744
I'm seeing cascading system
failures across the board.

258
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:40,258
Main antenna and backup
both down at the same time?

259
00:16:40,383 --> 00:16:42,063
With comms down,
the damage control team

260
00:16:42,188 --> 00:16:44,502
has no way of relaying
the status of the fire.

261
00:16:49,415 --> 00:16:51,764
<i>Galactica, come in,
Galactica, come in.</i>

262
00:16:51,889 --> 00:16:53,701
<i>Galactica, do you read?</i>

263
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,619
So you're tryin' to tell me
that all communications are still out?

264
00:17:00,836 --> 00:17:02,788
What the hell's being done...

265
00:17:08,207 --> 00:17:10,569
Whatever this is about,
you're making a big mistake.

266
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:12,814
Oh, sure, we're confused.

267
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,895
Maybe we should have a trial,
sort it all out.

268
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,828
After four years of fighting
with those Cylon things,

269
00:17:18,953 --> 00:17:22,056
did you really think you could
make a deal with them?

270
00:17:28,566 --> 00:17:30,632
So where are
your precious Cylons now?

271
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,760
Take it from someone who died once,
it's no fun.

272
00:17:37,358 --> 00:17:39,057
- Let him go.
- Frak you.

273
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:45,031
I could do this all day.
Who's next? Racetrack?

274
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,439
Connor?

275
00:17:48,841 --> 00:17:49,948
Let him go.

276
00:17:55,048 --> 00:17:57,202
All right, we need
to get the hell outta here.

277
00:17:57,357 --> 00:17:58,530
Kara, now.

278
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:00,949
Follow me.

279
00:18:02,006 --> 00:18:03,498
- Please.
- Ah, Gods!

280
00:18:05,394 --> 00:18:08,627
Hang on, Buddy.
Hang on, you're gonna be all right.

281
00:18:11,021 --> 00:18:12,750
I know, it tastes kinda yucky.

282
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:15,798
I'll get more sugar next time
in the galley, okay?

283
00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:20,269
Okay.

284
00:18:20,605 --> 00:18:23,972
Sharon, you better get her
finished up and down to day care.

285
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:30,580
- I don't know, just grab Hera...
- In here!

286
00:18:31,399 --> 00:18:32,930
Go ahead, Captain, grab for it!

287
00:18:33,055 --> 00:18:34,209
Okay, easy, easy.

288
00:18:34,443 --> 00:18:36,424
You want me, fine,
just leave them out of it.

289
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:38,192
Get her outta here, move!

290
00:18:40,131 --> 00:18:42,806
Remember me, big man?
From Pegasus?

291
00:18:43,054 --> 00:18:46,162
You and that toaster Tyrol
wasted my friend Thorne.

292
00:18:48,871 --> 00:18:50,238
We didn't want that to happen.

293
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:53,046
You had a choice but you backed
the skin-job over your own kind.

294
00:18:53,588 --> 00:18:56,586
And to prove how messed up it was,
instead of showin' you the airlock,

295
00:18:56,711 --> 00:18:59,883
your Cylon-loving Admiral
promoted you to CAG.

296
00:19:00,565 --> 00:19:02,511
- Frak you.
- Sorry.

297
00:19:03,074 --> 00:19:06,098
I'm savin' myself
for your sweet, toaster wife.

298
00:19:16,758 --> 00:19:18,506
Skulls, Racetrack?

299
00:19:20,063 --> 00:19:21,597
Gods, I flew with them.

300
00:19:21,962 --> 00:19:23,449
Semper frakkin' fi.

301
00:19:23,709 --> 00:19:26,622
Damn it. Way Connor was talkin', they
got people ready to move on every deck.

302
00:19:27,009 --> 00:19:30,101
The hangar deck's just a beachhead.
They want the ship.

303
00:19:31,749 --> 00:19:35,014
- Zarek played me just right.
- Must've made some new friends.

304
00:19:35,139 --> 00:19:38,962
Yeah, with a hell of a lot of firepower.
Vipers, Raptors, gun batteries.

305
00:19:39,642 --> 00:19:41,596
You know, we can't do this alone.

306
00:19:44,815 --> 00:19:47,723
Right now, all we can count on
is you and me.

307
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:50,468
Take a breath, Lee.

308
00:19:50,593 --> 00:19:52,232
Feels good bein' alive, doesn't it?

309
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:54,233
What was that?

310
00:19:54,403 --> 00:19:56,152
Feelin' right
for the first time in weeks.

311
00:19:58,012 --> 00:20:00,325
Okay, Kara, my dad. Where is he?

312
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,408
He was in CIC
when communications crapped out.

313
00:20:02,533 --> 00:20:05,144
CIC's protected. He won't give up
without a fight. The President?

314
00:20:05,312 --> 00:20:06,376
Don't know.

315
00:20:07,829 --> 00:20:09,995
- All right, come with me.
- Go.

316
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:13,706
What do they have down there,
a forest fire?

317
00:20:13,831 --> 00:20:15,796
Where the frak are
my damage reports?

318
00:20:15,921 --> 00:20:17,770
Admiral,
sensors are still showing red,

319
00:20:17,895 --> 00:20:20,416
but these trace gas readings
don't make any sense.

320
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:21,548
They're normal.

321
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:23,342
If something was burnin' down there,

322
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:26,183
the carbon monoxide levels
would be spikin' through the roof.

323
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:29,643
If the fire's compromised our sensors,
it's possible our readings are suspect.

324
00:20:29,858 --> 00:20:32,399
With communications out,
we have no way of verifying anything.

325
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,941
All I know is
I'm tired of being blind.

326
00:20:35,877 --> 00:20:38,527
Private Jaffe.
Double-time it down to C deck.

327
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:42,132
Check in with the damage control team,
get their reports, and haul ass back.

328
00:20:42,257 --> 00:20:43,257
Yes, sir.

329
00:20:53,071 --> 00:20:54,081
Drop him.

330
00:20:57,758 --> 00:20:59,225
See you real soon.

331
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:03,024
Carl.

332
00:21:04,725 --> 00:21:06,239
They're going to kill us.

333
00:21:07,221 --> 00:21:08,229
Sam?

334
00:21:08,354 --> 00:21:10,309
Can you give me something
to stop the bleeding?

335
00:21:10,524 --> 00:21:11,532
All right.

336
00:21:11,826 --> 00:21:12,975
Don't you see?

337
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,106
Our children represent everything
that the humans hate.

338
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:19,715
With resurrection gone, the thought
that the Cylon race could survive

339
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,581
through natural procreation
terrifies them.

340
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:23,787
Enough.

341
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,605
You're scaring her.

342
00:21:27,154 --> 00:21:29,319
Right now, they need us alive...

343
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,474
To use as bargaining chips
against the rebel Cylons.

344
00:21:35,483 --> 00:21:36,460
Especially you.

345
00:21:38,174 --> 00:21:40,525
Look, if you're expecting
some grand wisdom,

346
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:42,083
you can forget it.

347
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:44,177
I don't have any more answers
than you do.

348
00:21:46,047 --> 00:21:47,722
You might wanna keep that
to yourself.

349
00:21:50,667 --> 00:21:51,893
No, they're coming down.

350
00:21:52,018 --> 00:21:55,073
We're headed toward 'em right now.
We can't hold 'em off.

351
00:21:59,903 --> 00:22:02,355
Come on, hurry!
Out here! We need more ammo!

352
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:41,109
Admiral, I checked the array.
The equipment's been jury-rigged...

353
00:22:41,442 --> 00:22:44,761
Sergeant of the guards, get your marines
in here! Nobody gets in or out!

354
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:48,074
What the hell are you doing?

355
00:22:54,144 --> 00:22:55,206
What is this?

356
00:23:00,347 --> 00:23:01,375
Admiral!

357
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:07,759
Hold your fire!
Cease fire!

358
00:23:07,884 --> 00:23:09,091
Hold your fire!

359
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:11,247
Nobody fires without my order!

360
00:23:12,181 --> 00:23:15,037
Admiral!
Get your staff to stand down.

361
00:23:15,162 --> 00:23:17,951
- You son of a bitch!
- Stand down, Colonel!

362
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:20,580
Everyone!

363
00:23:21,171 --> 00:23:22,297
Stand down!

364
00:23:27,995 --> 00:23:30,390
- You killed this boy.
- Admiral Adama,

365
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,492
I am removing you
from command of this ship.

366
00:23:33,068 --> 00:23:36,166
I am taking you into custody
on the charge of treason.

367
00:23:36,942 --> 00:23:39,766
You swore an oath
when you put that uniform on.

368
00:23:40,788 --> 00:23:42,986
You pledged to defend
this ship and her crew.

369
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:46,169
You swore the same allegiance.
What happened to your oath?

370
00:23:46,624 --> 00:23:50,054
For seven years, I have done
my frakking job and for what?

371
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:51,553
To take orders from a Cylon?

372
00:23:51,858 --> 00:23:54,306
To let machines network our ship?

373
00:23:55,448 --> 00:23:59,164
No, you... You are not the leader
that you were when we started.

374
00:24:00,496 --> 00:24:01,864
You're just a sad, old man

375
00:24:01,989 --> 00:24:05,480
that has let his heart and his affection
for a Cylon cloud his judgment.

376
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:08,692
I want you all to understand this!

377
00:24:10,956 --> 00:24:12,583
If you do this...

378
00:24:13,864 --> 00:24:15,895
there will be no forgiveness.

379
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:17,917
No amnesty.

380
00:24:24,372 --> 00:24:25,425
This boy...

381
00:24:27,178 --> 00:24:29,129
died honoring his uniform.

382
00:24:29,529 --> 00:24:30,540
You...

383
00:24:31,933 --> 00:24:33,608
You'll die with nothing.

384
00:24:35,591 --> 00:24:38,316
Sergeant of the guards, take the senior
staff, put them in a holding cell,

385
00:24:38,441 --> 00:24:40,436
place Admiral Adama
and Colonel Tigh under arrest.

386
00:24:41,818 --> 00:24:42,821
Do it!

387
00:24:43,697 --> 00:24:45,551
- Sir...
- Don't touch me!

388
00:24:46,099 --> 00:24:47,388
Please, sir.

389
00:24:48,181 --> 00:24:49,259
Take him.

390
00:25:18,313 --> 00:25:20,656
This isn't right.
Where are the guards?

391
00:25:31,515 --> 00:25:33,782
- Madam President, you all right?
- I'm fine.

392
00:25:34,534 --> 00:25:35,678
Get inside.

393
00:25:39,992 --> 00:25:41,552
There's been an uprising.

394
00:25:41,677 --> 00:25:44,209
I'm not sure how many of the crew
are involved.

395
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:45,378
It is widespread.

396
00:25:45,503 --> 00:25:47,919
Your father must know about this.
Can't the marines stop it?

397
00:25:48,089 --> 00:25:50,447
There should've been marines
outside that hatchway.

398
00:25:50,572 --> 00:25:52,844
Madam President,
we are in danger of losing this ship.

399
00:25:52,969 --> 00:25:55,484
Oh, my Gods. Bill...

400
00:25:55,609 --> 00:25:58,852
Yeah, I don't know. Without comm,
we can't get through to CIC.

401
00:25:59,533 --> 00:26:01,825
But it is bigger than Galactica.

402
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:04,645
Zarek's already back on Colonial One.
He wants the presidency.

403
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,689
Of course.
Frakking Zarek.

404
00:26:07,884 --> 00:26:10,193
He always had dangerous ideas.

405
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:13,224
It's not too late to stop this.
Address the fleet, call for calm.

406
00:26:13,349 --> 00:26:16,147
- The people will listen to you.
- I'll do whatever it takes.

407
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:19,285
And I will not allow Tom Zarek
to assume the presidency

408
00:26:19,453 --> 00:26:21,078
under any circumstances.

409
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,164
I have an idea about the wireless.


410
00:26:23,471 --> 00:26:24,624
Sir, intercom's up.

411
00:26:25,693 --> 00:26:28,252
I'm getting multiple reports of gunfire
near the engine room.

412
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:31,923
Order Redwing to move in with marines.
I want that area secured.

413
00:26:36,309 --> 00:26:37,742
Specialist Gage...

414
00:26:39,452 --> 00:26:40,632
Stay with us.

415
00:26:42,784 --> 00:26:45,886
Stack a heavy pile right here.
Stop them from gettin' in that door.

416
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:50,270
Come on, people, faster's better.
They could show up at anytime.

417
00:26:51,573 --> 00:26:54,433
You understand
I have no desire to leave you.

418
00:27:00,099 --> 00:27:01,557
No desire at all.

419
00:27:02,626 --> 00:27:03,771
But I have to go.

420
00:27:03,896 --> 00:27:06,109
If they're coming for anyone,
they're coming for me.

421
00:27:06,234 --> 00:27:08,398
- And you'll all be safer.
- No, it's our fault, Gaius,

422
00:27:08,523 --> 00:27:11,499
because we can't protect you
and I am so sorry for that.

423
00:27:11,783 --> 00:27:13,381
Your transport will be here soon.

424
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:15,190
I want you to take this.

425
00:27:15,315 --> 00:27:17,593
And I want you to know
that we will pray for you

426
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,595
and for your safe return, okay?

427
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:23,965
I'm deeply...

428
00:27:24,548 --> 00:27:25,588
Right.

429
00:27:26,461 --> 00:27:28,084
Okay, okay.

430
00:27:31,602 --> 00:27:32,825
Mr. Tyrol?

431
00:27:34,872 --> 00:27:36,583
You are absolutely certain

432
00:27:36,962 --> 00:27:38,572
that it's imperative I leave?

433
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,533
Look, I only know what Jeanne saw.

434
00:27:41,671 --> 00:27:43,869
The hangar deck's gone.
CIC and weapons are next.

435
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:45,865
And then nobody's safe here.
Hang on.

436
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:48,283
Right, right. So we should be
getting out of here soon...

437
00:27:48,408 --> 00:27:50,459
- Go.
- And getting hold of some weapons, no?

438
00:27:50,705 --> 00:27:51,868
Because...

439
00:27:53,013 --> 00:27:54,917
Jeanne, I don't want the statue.

440
00:27:55,111 --> 00:27:56,560
You can keep the statue.

441
00:27:56,685 --> 00:27:58,439
You keep the statue.

442
00:28:02,698 --> 00:28:03,819
Clear.

443
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:16,610
- Madam President, wait...
- It's all right. They know who I am.

444
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,736
I need to speak to Dr. Baltar.

445
00:28:20,997 --> 00:28:23,012
No, you're not welcome in here.

446
00:28:23,214 --> 00:28:24,747
I got this. Go ahead.

447
00:28:25,524 --> 00:28:27,788
- Go on.
- I need to see Baltar.

448
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:29,663
There's somethin' you need to know.

449
00:28:29,788 --> 00:28:32,199
I got people all over the ship
givin' me information.

450
00:28:32,324 --> 00:28:34,253
The Admiral
was just led away from the CIC.

451
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:38,659
- Where to?
- No idea. My guess would be the brig.

452
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,593
Don't trust the ship's comm systems.

453
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:43,562
We're using these.
The hangar deck's lost to us.

454
00:28:43,687 --> 00:28:46,349
If you get your father to the secondary
storage bay within the hour,

455
00:28:46,517 --> 00:28:50,223
- I'll get him off the ship.
- I'll handle the fleet, go.

456
00:28:51,871 --> 00:28:53,008
Galen...

457
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:55,107
Why?

458
00:28:55,232 --> 00:28:57,594
Old man deserves a better fate
than what he'll get from them.

459
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:00,780
Go find your father, Lee.

460
00:29:05,681 --> 00:29:07,130
It's Nowart, isn't it?

461
00:29:07,977 --> 00:29:11,096
- That's right, sir.
- I thought I remembered you. Marine.

462
00:29:12,164 --> 00:29:14,768
You put it on the line
when we took New Caprica.

463
00:29:15,054 --> 00:29:16,783
Got pretty hairy down there, sir.

464
00:29:16,908 --> 00:29:18,269
Screw the war stories.

465
00:29:18,394 --> 00:29:20,282
I remember you too, Maldonado.

466
00:29:20,855 --> 00:29:23,219
Big mouth, not much of a soldier.

467
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:25,043
It doesn't matter.

468
00:29:25,288 --> 00:29:28,026
Because when this is over,
there's gonna be a reckoning.

469
00:29:28,371 --> 00:29:30,841
And live or die, it's how you act today

470
00:29:31,296 --> 00:29:32,804
that's gonna matter.

471
00:29:33,385 --> 00:29:35,064
So what's it gonna be, Nowart?

472
00:29:36,152 --> 00:29:37,400
Admiral, don't do this.

473
00:29:37,568 --> 00:29:40,694
I'll be damned if I'm gonna let
a guy like you run me off my own ship.

474
00:29:42,153 --> 00:29:43,715
You wanna shoot? Go on.

475
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,553
Let's see if you got a pair.


476
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,332
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

477
00:29:54,603 --> 00:29:56,168
Put your hands behind your back.

478
00:29:56,422 --> 00:29:57,794
You all right, Saul?

479
00:29:58,049 --> 00:29:59,922
I'll live. What about him?

480
00:30:00,438 --> 00:30:01,257
I think...

481
00:30:02,086 --> 00:30:03,704
we'll take him with us. Go.

482
00:30:08,011 --> 00:30:11,142
<i>But obviously
I have to get back as quickly...</i>

483
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,646
Going somewhere?

484
00:30:12,771 --> 00:30:14,146
Yes, matter of fact, I am.

485
00:30:16,008 --> 00:30:18,384
They consider it
to be a precautionary measure.

486
00:30:19,227 --> 00:30:20,264
Sensible...

487
00:30:20,751 --> 00:30:22,528
Given the delicate nature of the fleet.

488
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:26,073
Very sensible, considering the fleet's
tearing itself to pieces right now.

489
00:30:26,542 --> 00:30:27,755
Have you come to pray?

490
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,653
No, I have something
more tangible in mind.

491
00:30:29,778 --> 00:30:32,183
There is a chance
that we can avoid more bloodshed

492
00:30:32,308 --> 00:30:34,112
if I address the fleet

493
00:30:34,364 --> 00:30:37,053
and reassure them
the Cylons mean no harm.

494
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:41,131
Your faith in your oratorical skills

495
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,651
is impressive.
And I'd love to help,

496
00:30:43,776 --> 00:30:46,863
but unfortunately, communication
down here, just as dodgy as...

497
00:30:47,047 --> 00:30:48,596
I know you have a wireless.

498
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:52,096
You've been using it to communicate
with you flock all these months.

499
00:30:52,221 --> 00:30:53,882
It's a trick, Gaius.

500
00:30:54,292 --> 00:30:55,610
I wish it were.

501
00:30:55,735 --> 00:30:58,305
She's afraid of your teachings.
She will take the wireless...

502
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:00,364
All right, okay, Paulla...

503
00:31:02,416 --> 00:31:03,461
Thank you.

504
00:31:10,387 --> 00:31:11,869
She's got a point, hasn't she?

505
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:14,433
I mean, if you can convince the fleet,

506
00:31:15,343 --> 00:31:16,874
why can't you convince her?

507
00:31:17,707 --> 00:31:20,791
The thing is that I never
really believed in your conversion,

508
00:31:20,916 --> 00:31:24,340
so I was counting on your well-honed
sense of self-preservation.

509
00:31:26,645 --> 00:31:29,005
I'm so sick of your insinuations.

510
00:31:30,295 --> 00:31:31,825
I recall your sudden allegiance

511
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,933
to the priestess Elosha
and the scrolls of Pythia

512
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:36,934
the last time
your political fortunes were in doubt.

513
00:31:37,642 --> 00:31:38,586
Tell me,

514
00:31:39,978 --> 00:31:42,024
how is that working out for you now?

515
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,445
If it makes you happy,

516
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,248
maybe we're both frauds

517
00:31:46,551 --> 00:31:49,189
and this is our last chance to atone.

518
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:54,514
Civilians are trying
to barricade the aft supply hold.

519
00:31:54,639 --> 00:31:55,567
I'm on it.

520
00:31:55,692 --> 00:31:58,045
Gaeta wants us to back up Redwing
in the engine room.

521
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:00,611
They got four civvies down,
but there's still some holdouts,

522
00:32:00,736 --> 00:32:02,973
so we're gonna need
some more firepower.

523
00:32:07,192 --> 00:32:08,844
Where were you taking us?

524
00:32:10,302 --> 00:32:11,215
The brig.

525
00:32:12,026 --> 00:32:14,363
Gaeta wants all essential personnel
and Cylons held...

526
00:32:14,488 --> 00:32:16,529
Might see some friendly faces there.

527
00:32:17,051 --> 00:32:18,054
Get up.

528
00:32:23,865 --> 00:32:25,596
Sir, ships' captains
are calling.

529
00:32:25,721 --> 00:32:28,821
They wanna know why Galactica's
not responding to their hails.

530
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:35,773
Put 'em up on speaker.
All of it.

531
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,641
And then get me
a scrambled line to Tom Zarek.

532
00:32:38,766 --> 00:32:41,458
- <i>We're unable to reach Galactica.</i>
- <i>Admiral Adama, do you read?</i>

533
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,202
- <i>Are they going to jump away?</i>
- <i>Who's in charge of Galactica?</i>

534
00:32:44,327 --> 00:32:47,381
- <i>Can't trust Admiral Adama.</i>
- <i>Any vessel in communication with Co...</i>

535
00:32:47,994 --> 00:32:49,091
I have Colonial One.

536
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,385
Mr. Zarek,

537
00:32:51,704 --> 00:32:53,679
<i>I've taken command of Galactica.</i>

538
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:55,743
<i>The Admiral and his staff
are in custody.</i>

539
00:32:55,868 --> 00:32:58,517
- Adama's still alive?
- <i>You sound disappointed.</i>

540
00:32:59,369 --> 00:33:01,770
It's a loose end.
I'm sure you have your reasons.

541
00:33:02,493 --> 00:33:04,386
<i>Still, congratulations are in order.</i>

542
00:33:04,511 --> 00:33:07,407
<i>With the future of the fleet at stake
you've done a very courageous thing.</i>

543
00:33:07,532 --> 00:33:09,644
We can fine-tune
our rationalizations later.

544
00:33:09,769 --> 00:33:11,989
I'm still bringing
communications back online.

545
00:33:12,376 --> 00:33:14,964
- <i>And the fleet's in an uproar.</i>
- Don't worry. They'll fall in line.

546
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:18,037
- <i>Especially after I shower them...</i>
- <i>Women and men of the fleet,</i>

547
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:19,952
- <i>this is your President.</i>
- What the frak?

548
00:33:20,077 --> 00:33:22,666
<i>We have come to a crossroads
in our long and painful journey.</i>

549
00:33:23,206 --> 00:33:25,324
Tom, are you hearing this?
Turn on your wireless.

550
00:33:25,449 --> 00:33:27,080
Of all the decisions that I have...

551
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:28,715
Where's this coming from?

552
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,954
... the presidency,

553
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:33,035
none was more frightening
or more difficult

554
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:36,576
than agreeing
to this alliance with the Cylons.

555
00:33:39,132 --> 00:33:41,693
But we have come to a crossroads

556
00:33:42,248 --> 00:33:44,824
in our long and painful journey.

557
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,666
Cylons and humans
have been at war for generations.

558
00:33:49,791 --> 00:33:51,189
We know nothing else.

559
00:33:51,601 --> 00:33:53,844
And we have been locked
in a struggle

560
00:33:53,969 --> 00:33:56,344
that has seen both sides suffer

561
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,048
unspeakable loss.

562
00:33:58,447 --> 00:33:59,828
With our supplies running low

563
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:02,062
<i>and our options limited,</i>

564
00:34:02,187 --> 00:34:05,219
<i>our former enemies
may represent our last,</i>

565
00:34:05,344 --> 00:34:07,191
<i>perhaps our only hope.</i>

566
00:34:07,975 --> 00:34:09,170
To those in the fleet...

567
00:34:09,544 --> 00:34:10,897
Find that frequency, Gage.

568
00:34:11,022 --> 00:34:14,115
<i>... who would reject this alliance,
I am asking you...</i>

569
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,469
Isolate the signal!

570
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:17,429
- I don't know how to.
- Gods damn it.

571
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:20,516
<i>No, I am begging you to reconsider</i>

572
00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:22,601
<i>and place your trust back in those</i>

573
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:25,981
who have brought you this far,
and to reject those traitors

574
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:29,329
who would use
your fear of the Cylons

575
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:31,800
<i>to destroy colonial civilization...</i>

576
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:39,034
<i>- President Roslin, do you read?
- Galactica, do you read?</i>

577
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:39,930
Sir.

578
00:34:41,388 --> 00:34:42,788
It's the Vice President.

579
00:34:50,018 --> 00:34:51,782
I couldn't get near the brig.

580
00:34:52,428 --> 00:34:53,802
Even if he is in there...

581
00:34:55,868 --> 00:34:57,855
- What's goin' on?
- Let's go.

582
00:35:16,501 --> 00:35:17,753
It's all right, Lee.

583
00:35:18,294 --> 00:35:19,365
We're all right.

584
00:35:20,216 --> 00:35:21,266
Thank Gods.

585
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:24,580
What the hell is this?

586
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:26,875
- Easy. He's our prisoner.
- Starbuck.

587
00:35:27,994 --> 00:35:30,062
- Lower your weapon.
- They've taken over the ship.

588
00:35:30,187 --> 00:35:32,238
If you want it back,
this is the only way.

589
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:34,465
We don't have time
to take prisoners.

590
00:35:38,109 --> 00:35:39,428
Get outta my face.

591
00:35:39,765 --> 00:35:40,553
Move!

592
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:46,234
They are not your men anymore.
They are the enemy.

593
00:35:50,312 --> 00:35:53,861
10 H 21 - SECONDARY STORAGE BAY

594
00:35:54,181 --> 00:35:55,492
Who would've thought?

595
00:35:58,742 --> 00:36:01,950
You probably knew him
better than anyone back on New Caprica.

596
00:36:03,102 --> 00:36:06,552
Well, obviously his loyalties
were divided even back then.

597
00:36:09,365 --> 00:36:11,539
We both made rather bad choices
when it comes

598
00:36:11,664 --> 00:36:14,546
to our presidential aides-de-camp
wouldn't you say?

599
00:36:18,237 --> 00:36:19,936
10 H 23 - WASTE WATER STORAGE

600
00:36:20,061 --> 00:36:22,100
How many men do you think Gaeta has?

601
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:24,264
- Enough.
- Hold up here.

602
00:36:24,669 --> 00:36:26,888
Middle of this mess,
you really think

603
00:36:27,013 --> 00:36:29,282
Tyrol's found a way off the ship?

604
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,480
You tell me. He's one of yours.

605
00:36:31,785 --> 00:36:34,086
- You got a problem?
- Yeah, I got a problem.

606
00:36:35,255 --> 00:36:37,190
Your people annihilated
the human race.

607
00:36:37,315 --> 00:36:39,761
No, let the great statesman talk.

608
00:36:39,886 --> 00:36:42,467
You wanna know why Tom Zarek's
got so much clout in this fleet?

609
00:36:42,592 --> 00:36:44,451
When you get past the arrogance,
he's right.

610
00:36:44,576 --> 00:36:48,282
We can pretend to put it behind us,
exchange lofty words about an alliance,

611
00:36:48,407 --> 00:36:52,292
- but if survival has come to that.
- It's all we've got. Now, calm down.

612
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,875
It's all they left us.

613
00:36:56,352 --> 00:36:59,281
Secondary storage airlock this way.
Let's go.

614
00:37:20,453 --> 00:37:21,328
CIC.

615
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:24,339
What?

616
00:37:25,315 --> 00:37:26,415
It's Baltar.

617
00:37:38,461 --> 00:37:40,727
- What do you want, Gaius?
- What do I want?

618
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,200
I want this to stop...

619
00:37:44,573 --> 00:37:45,573
now.

620
00:37:45,852 --> 00:37:47,556
Right now.
This is madness.

621
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:49,971
<i>This doesn't become, you know.
Treason.</i>

622
00:37:50,399 --> 00:37:53,353
<i>Or whatever they're gonna call it
when this thing is through. I know you,</i>

623
00:37:53,798 --> 00:37:54,798
Felix.

624
00:37:55,638 --> 00:37:57,388
I know you're a good man.

625
00:37:57,802 --> 00:37:59,502
You're an honorable man.

626
00:38:00,439 --> 00:38:01,987
You wanna do the right thing.

627
00:38:02,309 --> 00:38:05,059
<i>Even your failings have been
understandable.</i>

628
00:38:05,184 --> 00:38:07,423
What, like serving
in your corrupt administration?

629
00:38:07,548 --> 00:38:09,328
<i>You know exactly
what I'm talking about.</i>

630
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:10,896
Our little secret.

631
00:38:12,344 --> 00:38:13,916
Sealed with a very special pen.

632
00:38:15,607 --> 00:38:17,419
<i>But I forgive you for that, Felix.</i>

633
00:38:17,669 --> 00:38:18,886
<i>I'm telling you...</i>

634
00:38:19,607 --> 00:38:22,170
<i>If you are hungry for redemption,
this is not the way.</i>

635
00:38:22,295 --> 00:38:24,489
- Goodbye, Gaius.
<i>- Felix, please, listen to...</i>

636
00:38:37,769 --> 00:38:39,514
What's Raptor 6-1-9's mission?

637
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:41,902
Transporting human crew
from the Cylon baseship.

638
00:38:42,783 --> 00:38:44,859
They should have
called the LSO by now.

639
00:38:47,841 --> 00:38:49,995
They're not headed
for the hangar deck.

640
00:39:07,091 --> 00:39:08,101
We're ready.

641
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:21,900
It's good to see you, Mr. Tyrol.

642
00:39:22,688 --> 00:39:24,602
Forgot this place was down here.

643
00:39:25,451 --> 00:39:26,446
Everybody did.

644
00:39:27,262 --> 00:39:30,367
Got trashed during New Caprica,
but I brought it back online for this.

645
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,390
I came here because

646
00:40:01,908 --> 00:40:03,817
I don't want you to worry about me.

647
00:40:04,219 --> 00:40:06,269
And I know what you have to do.

648
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,497
<i>This is section 12, copy.</i>

649
00:40:12,973 --> 00:40:13,739
Go.

650
00:40:13,989 --> 00:40:17,342
<i>Marine fire team just went past.
Looks like they're comin' your way.</i>

651
00:40:17,546 --> 00:40:18,583
You got 2 minutes.

652
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:21,793
Take them back the way we came.
You go with them, Colonel.

653
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:23,837
Come too far
to walk out on you now, Bill.

654
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:26,590
- What are you doing, sir?
- Colonel and I are gonna make sure

655
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:28,800
that the President's Raptor
gets outta here safely.

656
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:44,874
<i>Initiating launch sequence.</i>

657
00:40:48,283 --> 00:40:49,237
Open it.

658
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:53,657
Admiral, Madam President, please.

659
00:40:56,803 --> 00:40:58,703
Let's move it.
Get it open.

660
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:04,444
Prepare to launch.

661
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:33,615
Raptor just took off
from an aft airlock.

662
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:34,950
They're not responding.

663
00:41:37,176 --> 00:41:39,830
- Gage, who's on CAP?
- I got Hotdog, Narcho...

664
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:42,582
Get me Narcho on a wireless.
Scramble frequency.

665
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,978
What are your orders?

666
00:41:54,966 --> 00:41:57,214
Arm all weapons.
Engage the target

667
00:41:57,582 --> 00:41:58,543
and destroy.

668
00:42:04,413 --> 00:42:06,773
You coulda gone over with her.

669
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:10,861
I couldn't have lived with it.

670
00:42:22,421 --> 00:42:23,832
Come on! Let's go!

671
00:42:38,415 --> 00:42:40,183
It's been an honor
to have served with you,

672
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:41,308
my friend.

673
00:42:46,201 --> 00:42:47,815
All right, soldier, give it to me.

674
00:42:48,367 --> 00:42:49,367
Cover up.

675
00:42:51,778 --> 00:42:53,128
Fire in the hole!
