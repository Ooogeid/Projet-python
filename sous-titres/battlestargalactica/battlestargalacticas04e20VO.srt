<i>Previously on</i> Battlestar Galactica

2
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:10,593
- You must be... Lee.
- Hi, I'm...

3
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:12,483
A girlfriend stealer for a brother.

4
00:00:12,608 --> 00:00:14,805
- Nice.
- Never stole his girlfriend.

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,056
He's a really bad liar right here.

6
00:00:17,198 --> 00:00:18,643
There's been a terrible accident.

7
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:21,181
Your sisters and your father
were all killed.

8
00:00:21,876 --> 00:00:23,189
How about you, love?

9
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:26,167
- Bet you charge a lot more than that?
- Shut your filthy mouth.

10
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:27,730
Stop being so disgusting.

11
00:00:27,855 --> 00:00:29,306
This is your father, Gaius.

12
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:31,656
I found your father
a new place to live.

13
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:33,440
The last time I saw him,

14
00:00:34,293 --> 00:00:35,368
he seemed happy.

15
00:00:44,124 --> 00:00:46,671
Bill, I've been having
that dream again.

16
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:51,253
If that's me lying there,
then what am I?

17
00:00:51,378 --> 00:00:53,662
She took these
from her own mortal remains.

18
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:55,930
The blood on these dog tags

19
00:00:56,544 --> 00:00:58,724
is 100% proof positive match

20
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:01,427
for one Kara Thrace.

21
00:01:02,266 --> 00:01:05,481
And you think there's some kind
of meaning in these musical notes.

22
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:07,066
I'm just groping mostly.

23
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:09,568
Looking for patterns,
trying to see what comes to me.

24
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:13,406
She's a half-human, half-machine
object of curiosity

25
00:01:13,982 --> 00:01:15,972
that holds the key
to our continued existence

26
00:01:16,097 --> 00:01:18,151
somewhere in her genetic code.

27
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,447
So let's get a tube in her
and get her ready.

28
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:23,718
Based on the coordinates
we got from Sam,

29
00:01:23,843 --> 00:01:26,472
we have determined
that the Cylon colony is located here.

30
00:01:26,597 --> 00:01:29,149
The colony's bound within
the gravity well of the black hole,

31
00:01:29,274 --> 00:01:30,833
but maintains a stable orbit.

32
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:33,995
This right here
is our only parking spot.

33
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,346
Point blank range.

34
00:01:35,471 --> 00:01:37,205
Leave only one way in and out,

35
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,306
then make it impossible
to get past the gates.

36
00:01:39,718 --> 00:01:41,016
Let's get to work.

37
00:01:42,533 --> 00:01:44,311
Can I have your attention, please?

38
00:01:44,615 --> 00:01:48,619
I'm going to be asking for volunteers
in the rescue of the child Hera.

39
00:01:49,414 --> 00:01:51,402
There is a line
running down this deck.

40
00:01:53,507 --> 00:01:56,907
Volunteers,
move to the starboard side.

41
00:01:57,257 --> 00:01:59,267
Everyone else, to the port.

42
00:02:22,348 --> 00:02:25,686
40? I never paid
more than 30 on Picon!

43
00:02:26,299 --> 00:02:27,605
This ain't Picon.

44
00:02:28,098 --> 00:02:29,710
Right, you got me there.

45
00:02:30,045 --> 00:02:32,401
"This ain't Picon." All right. 40.

46
00:02:33,172 --> 00:02:34,722
Show him a good time!

47
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,582
I don't want a lap dance, okay?

48
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,734
Try it! You'll like it!

49
00:02:40,796 --> 00:02:43,723
Keep the 40.
He deserves it. Thank you.

50
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:50,341
- Are you gonna take the job or not?
- Maybe I should just do it.

51
00:02:50,986 --> 00:02:52,963
I'm letting my pride get in the way.

52
00:02:53,088 --> 00:02:55,633
Now you're talkin'.
I mean, who cares?

53
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:59,510
It's one hour of your time,
and then you have a whole new life!

54
00:03:00,298 --> 00:03:02,456
A life without midnight watches,

55
00:03:02,581 --> 00:03:04,851
or drills,

56
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:08,313
or fleet politics,
or the inspections,

57
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,938
or any of that crap.

58
00:03:10,922 --> 00:03:11,922
Life!

59
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,799
You could be here every night!

60
00:03:15,924 --> 00:03:19,509
He won't be here every night.
Can hardly get him here once.

61
00:03:21,737 --> 00:03:22,937
To retirement?

62
00:03:24,394 --> 00:03:25,412
What do you say?

63
00:03:30,423 --> 00:03:31,620
To retirement.

64
00:03:41,735 --> 00:03:44,985
If you don't participate in politics,
then you are giving up your voice.

65
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,387
You're giving up your right
to have a say in the way

66
00:03:47,512 --> 00:03:49,639
that our society is run.

67
00:03:50,956 --> 00:03:53,858
- What?
- You've really bought into that crap?

68
00:03:54,027 --> 00:03:55,980
I do. Proudly.

69
00:03:56,825 --> 00:03:58,639
- And so do you, by the way.
- Really?

70
00:03:58,764 --> 00:04:01,991
That's what the uniform stands for.
It's what we train to defend.

71
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,826
- Oh, you didn't.
- It's true!

72
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:07,072
That's sad. That's sad.
It's cute, but it's sad.

73
00:04:07,197 --> 00:04:09,197
Lemme guess.
He's going on about voting

74
00:04:09,322 --> 00:04:11,701
and it's importance
to a democratic way of life again.

75
00:04:11,826 --> 00:04:13,294
So, you were listening.

76
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:16,138
You didn't tell me that your brother
was an idealistic dreamer.

77
00:04:16,263 --> 00:04:19,557
- Dreamer.
- It's sad. Truth is, he's not.

78
00:04:20,075 --> 00:04:24,013
Beneath that romantic exterior
lies the heart of a true cynic.

79
00:04:24,256 --> 00:04:26,682
- Things are looking up.
- This is gonna be fascinating.

80
00:04:26,851 --> 00:04:29,448
Yeah, it's one of the many,
many, many reasons

81
00:04:29,573 --> 00:04:31,604
that him and dad
aren't on speaking terms anymore.

82
00:04:32,447 --> 00:04:34,481
- Come on.
- Family angst syndrome,

83
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,199
I love it. Come on, boys.

84
00:04:36,324 --> 00:04:38,448
- Let's open up some old wounds.
- No, let's not.

85
00:04:38,573 --> 00:04:41,136
Dad believes in the system.
Believes in the uniform.

86
00:04:41,261 --> 00:04:43,324
Believes in something
greater than himself.

87
00:04:43,493 --> 00:04:45,222
Correction, dad believes in himself.

88
00:04:45,347 --> 00:04:47,690
His uniform, his system,
his way of life.

89
00:04:47,815 --> 00:04:50,199
And if you're not with him
in that tiny, little bubble,

90
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:53,239
- then you might as well not exist.
- If you hate him so much,

91
00:04:53,364 --> 00:04:55,016
why'd you follow in his footsteps?

92
00:04:56,394 --> 00:04:57,394
<i>Touché.</i>

93
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,643
Service gave me four years of college.
I gave the service four years in return.

94
00:05:07,072 --> 00:05:08,557
- Simple as that.
- See?

95
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:09,941
A cynic.

96
00:05:10,066 --> 00:05:13,864
Right through to that big, empty space
that used to hold his heart.

97
00:05:14,575 --> 00:05:17,525
Honey, I think
I'm starting to like your brother.

98
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,880
You must be Sean.

99
00:05:22,575 --> 00:05:23,875
Yeah, I must be.

100
00:05:24,512 --> 00:05:25,512
I hope so.

101
00:05:27,013 --> 00:05:29,662
- I'll take these. They're beautiful.
- You're welcome.

102
00:05:29,886 --> 00:05:31,536
Do you like white wine?

103
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:32,698
I do.

104
00:05:34,262 --> 00:05:35,462
Kinda awkward?

105
00:05:36,448 --> 00:05:38,921
- Blind date and all?
- No, it's not, really.

106
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:41,949
It's just that I have this feeling.

107
00:05:43,198 --> 00:05:45,138
- That I know you.
- Oh?

108
00:05:45,715 --> 00:05:46,715
Really?

109
00:05:48,842 --> 00:05:50,292
There you go, Sean.

110
00:05:50,465 --> 00:05:52,559
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

111
00:06:00,032 --> 00:06:01,232
Wait a minute.

112
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,325
You were one of my students.

113
00:06:11,717 --> 00:06:13,417
Yeah, guilty as charged.

114
00:06:14,531 --> 00:06:17,731
I mean, as soon as Marcie
mentioned your name I knew,

115
00:06:18,518 --> 00:06:19,837
but I didn't wanna tell her.

116
00:06:21,217 --> 00:06:24,383
- You knew I was old enough to be...
- My teacher? Yeah.

117
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:26,765
But I graduated.

118
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,010
Some time ago.

119
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,998
- Should I go?
- Did I say you should go?

120
00:06:41,094 --> 00:06:42,151
I didn't say that.

121
00:06:50,665 --> 00:06:52,591
The night's young.
Apparently so are you.

122
00:06:52,716 --> 00:06:54,366
Let's see what happens.

123
00:06:59,288 --> 00:07:00,313
Sean Allison.

124
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,207
You wouldn't do it.

125
00:07:06,496 --> 00:07:09,720
For that kind of money?
You're Gods damn right I would.

126
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:11,239
No, you wouldn't.

127
00:07:12,968 --> 00:07:15,918
Look me in the eye
and tell me that you'd do it.

128
00:07:16,466 --> 00:07:20,129
That you'd do it
for a civilian desk job.

129
00:07:21,268 --> 00:07:23,742
I wanna hear it
come outta your mouth.

130
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:24,970
Say it!

131
00:07:32,028 --> 00:07:33,478
I frakkin' knew it.

132
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:44,647
Come on, soldier.

133
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:46,395
I love you guys.

134
00:07:46,851 --> 00:07:48,851
Because you guys are my family.

135
00:07:52,342 --> 00:07:54,893
My Gods. My Gods. Come on.

136
00:07:55,157 --> 00:07:57,506
- I love you, brother.
- Come on, big boy.

137
00:07:57,996 --> 00:07:59,410
- Legs.
- All right.

138
00:07:59,535 --> 00:08:00,535
In you go.

139
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:03,408
- You want out?
- Yes, please.

140
00:08:04,118 --> 00:08:05,118
Thank you.

141
00:08:07,742 --> 00:08:11,133
- He never could hold his liquor.
- Unlike his brother.

142
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:13,909
I'm still standing.

143
00:08:15,284 --> 00:08:16,484
Which means...

144
00:08:17,617 --> 00:08:19,117
It's time for shots.

145
00:09:23,565 --> 00:09:26,265
There's no need
to torture yourself, Gaius.

146
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,706
Just trust in God's plan for you.

147
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:35,990
What is God's plan for me?

148
00:09:38,189 --> 00:09:40,489
Well, you're following it right now.

149
00:09:41,066 --> 00:09:42,066
Am I?

150
00:09:43,746 --> 00:09:46,246
By taking charge
of mankind's remnants,

151
00:09:47,005 --> 00:09:49,005
and guiding them to their end.

152
00:09:53,566 --> 00:09:54,666
End of what?

153
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:56,128
Gaius.

154
00:09:57,442 --> 00:09:59,376
- We're ready to go.
- Five seconds, Paulla.

155
00:09:59,935 --> 00:10:00,985
I'm just...

156
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:15,489
I'm leaving Ishay enough
for two more rounds of injections.

157
00:10:15,614 --> 00:10:18,897
That should keep you on your feet
for another 48 hours.

158
00:10:19,022 --> 00:10:20,272
Two days. Okay.

159
00:10:20,646 --> 00:10:22,740
That's... Should be enough.

160
00:10:23,771 --> 00:10:27,209
You're using up the last little bit
of life you got. You realize that?

161
00:10:28,207 --> 00:10:29,021
Yes.

162
00:10:29,146 --> 00:10:31,796
You've made that clear to me
several times.

163
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:35,401
Right. That's it.

164
00:10:35,526 --> 00:10:37,302
- We're done.
- Thank you.

165
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:38,837
And...

166
00:10:40,712 --> 00:10:41,765
Thank you, Doctor.

167
00:10:42,653 --> 00:10:44,253
I'm just doing my job.

168
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,150
No.

169
00:10:51,715 --> 00:10:54,765
You've done much more than that.
You've taken a...

170
00:10:55,064 --> 00:10:57,919
patient who should've died

171
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,950
years ago, and you've...

172
00:11:00,275 --> 00:11:02,347
given her a chance despite cancer,

173
00:11:02,472 --> 00:11:05,914
and the Cylons,
and her own obstinate nature.

174
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,549
And you've...

175
00:11:08,903 --> 00:11:11,569
You've given me
the little time I have left,

176
00:11:11,694 --> 00:11:13,144
and for that you...

177
00:11:14,086 --> 00:11:15,286
You have my...

178
00:11:17,465 --> 00:11:18,565
my heartfelt

179
00:11:20,789 --> 00:11:22,829
gratitude and my thanks.

180
00:11:27,026 --> 00:11:28,026
Well, I...

181
00:11:28,965 --> 00:11:30,647
I don't know what to say.

182
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:31,751
Don't.

183
00:11:33,774 --> 00:11:36,570
Don't spoil your image, just
light a cigarette and go and grumble.

184
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:45,954
It's your patient now, Ishay.

185
00:11:50,715 --> 00:11:51,715
Ishay, I...

186
00:11:52,338 --> 00:11:55,172
- I can barely see straight.
- I'm not surprised.

187
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:58,759
You're so pumped full of drugs
you could float off this bed.

188
00:11:59,901 --> 00:12:00,901
Okay.

189
00:12:01,026 --> 00:12:02,026
Two days?

190
00:12:03,965 --> 00:12:05,465
All right, two days.

191
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:08,435
The plan's just starting to take shape,
but one thing's clear.

192
00:12:08,837 --> 00:12:11,287
Raptors get the toughest job,
as usual.

193
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,415
This will require
some special piloting skills,

194
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,859
and I mean special.

195
00:12:16,692 --> 00:12:20,099
Threading a needle
while you're on a rollercoaster special.

196
00:12:20,671 --> 00:12:22,399
It seems a little redundant,

197
00:12:22,524 --> 00:12:25,974
the word's come down
that it's a volunteer assignment so...

198
00:12:28,087 --> 00:12:29,937
That's my Raptor wranglers.

199
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,800
Always looking for new
and interesting ways to get killed.

200
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,522
I'm not gonna lie to you, boys,
we are thin on intel on this one.

201
00:12:39,647 --> 00:12:41,899
The Cylons believe
that the most logical place for Cavil

202
00:12:42,024 --> 00:12:45,789
to have taken the girl
is deep into the interior of the Colony.

203
00:12:46,777 --> 00:12:47,777
Best guess.

204
00:12:48,826 --> 00:12:49,643
Right here.

205
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:52,837
We'll be in too close for nukes.
Same thing goes for missiles.

206
00:12:52,962 --> 00:12:54,981
Now this gonna be strictly
a gun battle.

207
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:59,099
Like two old ships on the line,
slugging it out at point-blank range.

208
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:04,647
I want the gun captains to do their job
and start firing immediately.

209
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:07,589
And to continue to fire
until they run outta ammo.

210
00:13:07,714 --> 00:13:08,714
Then...

211
00:13:09,962 --> 00:13:12,262
I want them to start throwing rocks.

212
00:13:14,081 --> 00:13:17,399
They're gonna have every gun trained
directly on us as soon as we jump in.

213
00:13:17,524 --> 00:13:18,964
If we have any shot at this,

214
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,339
we're gonna have to interrupt
their fire control systems.

215
00:13:21,464 --> 00:13:24,025
And just how the hell is Sam
supposed to help with that?

216
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:27,900
If we can plug him into Galactica's
dradis, FTL, and C-3 systems,

217
00:13:28,213 --> 00:13:30,464
his mind should then be able
to directly communicate

218
00:13:30,589 --> 00:13:33,189
with the colony's hybrids
once we jump in.

219
00:13:33,526 --> 00:13:36,274
Theoretically, his mind should still
be able to control their commands

220
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,599
and slow down their response time.

221
00:13:41,338 --> 00:13:42,338
Okay.

222
00:13:44,337 --> 00:13:46,987
- Let's do it, I guess.
- There's a catch.

223
00:13:47,649 --> 00:13:49,578
Routing hardware connections
from all systems

224
00:13:49,858 --> 00:13:51,838
into this room is gonna take weeks.

225
00:13:51,963 --> 00:13:55,212
It's a lot easier, faster,
if we move him to the existing lines.

226
00:13:55,337 --> 00:13:58,487
- Okay, where's that?
- Well, best place is the CIC.

227
00:14:07,482 --> 00:14:09,825
I need someone to lead this fleet

228
00:14:10,288 --> 00:14:13,941
who I trust,
and demands universal respect.

229
00:14:15,026 --> 00:14:17,948
So the baseship
and the fleet are yours.

230
00:14:21,588 --> 00:14:22,838
Thank you, sir.

231
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:24,949
I won't let you down.

232
00:14:25,837 --> 00:14:27,187
I know you won't.

233
00:14:27,463 --> 00:14:29,513
I'll see you at the rendezvous.

234
00:14:30,523 --> 00:14:33,573
If we're not there in 12 hours,
we won't be comin'.

235
00:14:34,024 --> 00:14:35,024
Yes, sir.

236
00:14:38,088 --> 00:14:39,488
Good hunting, sir.

237
00:14:40,211 --> 00:14:41,961
Thank you, Admiral Hoshi.

238
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,070
Still not too late
to flush them all out the airlock.

239
00:15:37,296 --> 00:15:38,436
Take too much time.

240
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,015
I suppose this is what you could
call poetic justice.

241
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,169
Or what goes around comes around.

242
00:16:09,294 --> 00:16:10,344
Either way,

243
00:16:11,047 --> 00:16:13,232
congratulations, Mr. President.

244
00:16:13,357 --> 00:16:16,057
Thank you, Mr. Adama.
And the best of luck.

245
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:20,812
Admiral Hoshi, sir.

246
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,980
Sir.

247
00:16:24,044 --> 00:16:27,027
- The "sir" is...
- Right. Good luck.

248
00:16:27,196 --> 00:16:28,346
You too, sir.

249
00:16:30,927 --> 00:16:32,449
President of the colonies,

250
00:16:32,887 --> 00:16:35,773
Admiral of the fleet, departing.

251
00:16:50,786 --> 00:16:54,246
All right, last Raptor out, people!
Last Raptor out!

252
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:57,972
Anyone left behind,
your ass belongs to us!

253
00:17:11,891 --> 00:17:14,699
Great.
Can we tuck this in there?

254
00:17:16,874 --> 00:17:19,079
Listen, I'm not coming with you.

255
00:17:19,543 --> 00:17:21,169
- No, please.
- I made up my mind.

256
00:17:21,294 --> 00:17:24,546
- Our people need you.
- I don't belong to you, Paulla.

257
00:17:24,671 --> 00:17:26,044
I never belonged to you.

258
00:17:26,422 --> 00:17:27,922
You appropriated me.

259
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:30,481
I'm sorry.

260
00:17:31,294 --> 00:17:33,301
I'm sorry if I led you to believe...

261
00:17:35,423 --> 00:17:39,291
They're all yours, Paulla, enjoy them.
Pilot, you have your passengers.

262
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:42,185
- Gaius, don't do this.
- Maybe I'll see you in the next life.

263
00:17:50,592 --> 00:17:51,592
Doctor.

264
00:18:14,947 --> 00:18:16,674
<i>Galactica, baseship actual.</i>

265
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:18,846
<i>The flag's been transferred
to the baseship,</i>

266
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:21,237
<i>our vipers are ready
to take over CAP duties for the fleet.</i>

267
00:18:21,362 --> 00:18:23,522
Roger that, baseship,
you have the CAP.

268
00:18:23,689 --> 00:18:26,149
- Safe journey.
<i>- Godspeed, Galactica.</i>

269
00:18:27,353 --> 00:18:29,087
Let's go around the horn.

270
00:18:34,596 --> 00:18:35,968
This is the XO.

271
00:18:37,021 --> 00:18:39,947
All combat stations
prepare to report.

272
00:18:40,171 --> 00:18:41,860
<i>- FTL.</i>
- Go.

273
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,757
We'll set up triage here.
Just prep the table the way that I do.

274
00:18:44,882 --> 00:18:45,883
<i>Weapons.</i>

275
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:47,108
<i>Go.</i>

276
00:18:47,641 --> 00:18:48,952
Separate out the wounded.

277
00:18:49,077 --> 00:18:50,439
Those we can save,

278
00:18:50,564 --> 00:18:52,015
and those we can't.

279
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:53,840
- <i>Engineering.
- Go.</i>

280
00:18:54,129 --> 00:18:55,445
How will I know?

281
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,663
Take this marker.

282
00:18:58,191 --> 00:19:00,763
Put an X on the forehead
of those who are too badly hurt.

283
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,568
You'll know when you see them.

284
00:19:02,693 --> 00:19:03,835
<i>Main battery.</i>

285
00:19:04,552 --> 00:19:05,552
<i>Go.</i>

286
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,701
- <i>Engine room.
- Go.</i>

287
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:09,189
We're next.

288
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:10,954
<i>Sick bay.</i>

289
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:16,377
<i>Sick bay's a go.</i>

290
00:19:17,943 --> 00:19:19,653
- <i>Viper wing.</i>
- Go.

291
00:19:20,802 --> 00:19:21,905
<i>Assault one.</i>

292
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:28,569
<i>Assault two.</i>

293
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,056
<i>Reserve force.</i>

294
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:37,647
<i>Com 1.</i>

295
00:19:42,141 --> 00:19:43,878
- Sorry.
- Caprica.

296
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:45,626
<i>Com 2.</i>

297
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,715
What're you doing here?

298
00:19:53,487 --> 00:19:54,506
What...

299
00:19:55,245 --> 00:19:57,461
I don't think you should be here.

300
00:19:58,433 --> 00:20:00,903
Probably been in more battles
than you've have.

301
00:20:05,782 --> 00:20:06,785
Fair point.

302
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,117
<i>Life support.</i>

303
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,939
<i>Emergency system standing by.</i>

304
00:20:11,472 --> 00:20:14,605
I suppose a more pertinent question is
what am I doing here?

305
00:20:17,725 --> 00:20:19,613
What the hell was I thinking?

306
00:20:23,296 --> 00:20:25,620
<i>Secure blast doors on all decks.</i>

307
00:20:32,723 --> 00:20:33,726
Ellen.

308
00:20:34,444 --> 00:20:36,353
I think we're a go up here.

309
00:20:37,147 --> 00:20:38,482
All stations report, sir.

310
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,541
Connect me just to the ship.

311
00:20:44,121 --> 00:20:45,577
This is the Admiral.

312
00:20:45,907 --> 00:20:49,083
Just so there'll be
no misunderstandings later...

313
00:20:51,031 --> 00:20:53,209
Galactica's seen a lot of history.

314
00:20:54,218 --> 00:20:56,129
<i>Gone through a lot of battles.</i>

315
00:20:57,624 --> 00:20:59,333
<i>This will be her last.</i>

316
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:03,271
<i>She will not fail us</i>

317
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,173
<i>if we do not fail her.</i>

318
00:21:07,089 --> 00:21:10,578
<i>If we succeed in our mission,
Galactica will bring us home.</i>

319
00:21:12,261 --> 00:21:13,448
<i>If we don't...</i>

320
00:21:14,656 --> 00:21:16,360
<i>It doesn't matter anyway.</i>

321
00:21:18,042 --> 00:21:19,342
Action, stations.

322
00:21:21,138 --> 00:21:23,068
- Start the clock.
- Start the clock.

323
00:21:23,613 --> 00:21:24,924
Jump on my mark.

324
00:21:25,455 --> 00:21:26,999
Five, four,

325
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,550
three,

326
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:30,145
two, one,

327
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:31,581
mark.

328
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,300
We can't take much of this.

329
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:38,208
It's time, Sam.

330
00:23:01,989 --> 00:23:04,340
Look through the eye
just with thyself.

331
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:24,690
The Colony hybrids are offline.
They'll be launching raiders any minute.

332
00:23:26,617 --> 00:23:27,822
Launch all wings.

333
00:23:49,022 --> 00:23:50,329
Birds are away.

334
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:52,731
All ahead, flank speed!

335
00:23:52,978 --> 00:23:55,368
Three, two, one, hit it!

336
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:58,061
<i>All hands brace for impact.</i>

337
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,925
<i>Assault one, stand by.</i>

338
00:24:56,458 --> 00:24:58,208
Here they come, let's take 'em!

339
00:25:07,595 --> 00:25:08,725
Light it up.

340
00:25:14,639 --> 00:25:16,082
Assault team on me.

341
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:27,343
Let's do this. Go. Get out there.

342
00:25:48,912 --> 00:25:49,956
Pressure.

343
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:52,381
- We've got pressure, sir.
- One atmosphere.

344
00:25:53,649 --> 00:25:55,715
Assault one, we got pressure.

345
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:02,094
Alpha team, helmets off.

346
00:26:18,517 --> 00:26:19,518
Move out.

347
00:26:30,882 --> 00:26:32,372
Think we lost Cartwheel.

348
00:26:32,497 --> 00:26:35,430
- Dradis is almost useless out here.
- I hope that works both ways.

349
00:26:35,555 --> 00:26:37,211
Any sign they spotted our approach?

350
00:26:37,336 --> 00:26:40,779
I haven't looked at the instruments.
I don't think you want me to start now.

351
00:26:40,904 --> 00:26:41,806
Maybe not.

352
00:26:42,028 --> 00:26:44,809
Let's go weapons hot, Skulls.
We're gettin' close.

353
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,286
- Sure about that?
- No.

354
00:26:46,411 --> 00:26:49,023
But I don't wanna come outta this crap
with cold weapons, either.

355
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,095
Nukes are hot.

356
00:26:55,711 --> 00:26:58,449
You know, this reminds me
of that time back during landing qual.

357
00:27:10,004 --> 00:27:12,351
Battery three, redirect your fire!

358
00:27:12,476 --> 00:27:13,713
Ten degrees starboard!

359
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,840
Concentrate on taking out
the Cylon batteries!

360
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,133
Hotdog, Ladykiller,

361
00:27:17,408 --> 00:27:19,344
<i>concentrate
on taking out Cylon raiders</i>

362
00:27:19,514 --> 00:27:21,805
coming in at 084 carom 229.

363
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:23,391
Tally, Galactica. We got 'em.

364
00:27:39,902 --> 00:27:41,806
<i>We have a hard seal. Go.</i>

365
00:28:28,899 --> 00:28:30,708
You're gonna just
keep doing the tests.

366
00:28:31,098 --> 00:28:33,085
Even with the Colony
coming down around your ears?

367
00:28:33,501 --> 00:28:35,296
I think you overestimate
their chances.

368
00:28:35,563 --> 00:28:38,132
They may have confused
our hybrids temporarily,

369
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,195
but we have superior fire power
and superior numbers.

370
00:28:41,756 --> 00:28:44,138
And in the end
it's all about mathematics.

371
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:26,931
Listen to me.

372
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:29,600
You're pushing too much energy
through the ACS. You gotta back off.

373
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:31,894
You're gonna blow the main bus.
You hear me?

374
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,312
Sam!

375
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:37,568
There are secrets within the eyes,
answers within riddles.

376
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:39,693
Lay off the ACS?
You betcha, Galen.

377
00:29:39,818 --> 00:29:41,821
Hear what your heart wants to deny.

378
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:43,155
End of line.

379
00:29:50,732 --> 00:29:52,753
You never should've trusted her.

380
00:29:52,878 --> 00:29:54,625
Trust didn't enter into it.

381
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:58,767
I simply miscalculated her need
to engage in gestures of futility.

382
00:29:59,984 --> 00:30:02,109
We have to assume
that she'll try to make contact

383
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:04,712
with the colonial forces
aboard the Colony.

384
00:30:05,607 --> 00:30:08,505
- It's time to go on the offensive.
- We must be cautious.

385
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:11,008
Too much force
could risk killing the child.

386
00:30:11,133 --> 00:30:12,418
Really? Ya think?

387
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:15,688
Please continue stating
the perfectly obvious.

388
00:30:16,072 --> 00:30:17,892
It fills me with confidence.

389
00:30:29,447 --> 00:30:30,757
I'm proud of you.

390
00:30:33,837 --> 00:30:34,837
What?

391
00:30:36,698 --> 00:30:37,892
For doing this.

392
00:30:38,382 --> 00:30:40,467
For being here
when you coulda just walked away.

393
00:30:40,592 --> 00:30:42,785
I don't think
I ever said it before, but...

394
00:30:43,196 --> 00:30:45,228
I always wanted to be proud of you.

395
00:30:49,693 --> 00:30:52,541
Guess I always felt
that was the only thing missing.

396
00:31:07,281 --> 00:31:09,493
All the pieces
are falling into place.

397
00:31:18,324 --> 00:31:21,837
You will hold the future
of Cylons and humans in your hands.

398
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:23,450
I will?

399
00:31:26,576 --> 00:31:27,635
You see them?

400
00:31:33,761 --> 00:31:34,808
Reconnect me!

401
00:31:35,019 --> 00:31:37,770
Cylons just blew a hole
into deck 21!

402
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:40,490
Frakkin' Centurions'll be pouring in
at platoon strength!

403
00:32:02,872 --> 00:32:04,255
On me, let's move!

404
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:50,718
Wait.

405
00:32:59,731 --> 00:33:01,103
Tell the Old Man...

406
00:33:01,857 --> 00:33:02,813
I owed him one.

407
00:33:04,062 --> 00:33:06,071
Doesn't change
anything you did, though.

408
00:33:09,614 --> 00:33:11,226
We all make our choices.

409
00:33:12,988 --> 00:33:14,588
Today I made a choice.

410
00:33:16,423 --> 00:33:17,745
I think it's my last one.

411
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:21,790
It's really touching.
Can we get the hell outta here?

412
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,792
You should know
your Raptor's been destroyed.

413
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:26,086
You can't go back that way.

414
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:28,922
- Well, that's not the plan.
- Can we not tell her the plan?

415
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:30,132
Right.

416
00:33:39,616 --> 00:33:42,438
Missed the trap seven times
in two days.

417
00:33:43,176 --> 00:33:45,026
It's a new galactic record.

418
00:33:45,778 --> 00:33:48,265
Regs say
that you've washed out, rook.

419
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:53,857
- Time to look for a new career.
- What do you want me to do, sir?

420
00:33:54,492 --> 00:33:57,201
Do you want me to beg for my billet?
Do you want me to crawl?

421
00:33:57,369 --> 00:34:00,454
I want you to land your frakkin' bird
without diggin' holes into my deck.

422
00:34:00,923 --> 00:34:01,992
How's that?

423
00:34:02,118 --> 00:34:03,670
How about being a pilot?

424
00:34:04,243 --> 00:34:06,335
An officer worthy of the uniform.

425
00:34:06,743 --> 00:34:08,335
Take your job seriously.

426
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:11,197
Don't let your personal life
get in the way.

427
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:14,908
I've read your jacket.

428
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:16,600
Your whole story.

429
00:34:17,552 --> 00:34:20,807
I know that your family's gone,
and I know that you have no home.

430
00:34:21,246 --> 00:34:23,034
All you got is the service.

431
00:34:23,381 --> 00:34:24,853
And it's slowly slippin' away.

432
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,244
All because...

433
00:34:28,703 --> 00:34:30,472
you're wrapped up
in survivor's guilt.

434
00:34:30,597 --> 00:34:33,627
You're trying to find
a way to wash yourself out.

435
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,258
The Doctor's in.

436
00:34:36,764 --> 00:34:38,716
Check your neuroses at the door.

437
00:34:40,608 --> 00:34:42,682
Lotta people have died on this ship.

438
00:34:42,807 --> 00:34:45,182
There's a lotta ghosts
running around here.

439
00:34:45,307 --> 00:34:48,121
You don't wanna pull them
into your cockpit with you.

440
00:34:48,246 --> 00:34:50,246
Because you won't come back alive.

441
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:51,938
Do you understand that?

442
00:34:52,185 --> 00:34:53,197
Yes, sir.

443
00:34:54,247 --> 00:34:56,016
I don't think you do, but...

444
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:58,262
maybe someday you will.

445
00:34:59,811 --> 00:35:01,026
As for now...

446
00:35:02,872 --> 00:35:05,014
make the trap tomorrow, rook.

447
00:35:06,682 --> 00:35:07,682
Dismissed.

448
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,400
Thank you, sir.

449
00:35:12,122 --> 00:35:13,258
I owe you one.

450
00:35:14,464 --> 00:35:17,370
A lot of other people owe me one,
but you know what,

451
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,811
very few people ever pay back.

452
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:22,242
Especially the ones
that owe you their lives.

453
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:27,875
I'll pay you back one day, sir.
When it really means something.

454
00:35:30,251 --> 00:35:31,329
You do that.

455
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,801
Okay, get this guy cross-checked
and set me up a large-bore IV.

456
00:35:38,721 --> 00:35:42,063
I need a set of wipers on this marine,
and a CT scan over here on this one.

457
00:35:42,188 --> 00:35:43,895
And get him the frak out of here!

458
00:35:44,488 --> 00:35:45,768
It's all right.

459
00:35:46,126 --> 00:35:47,528
You've gonna be all right.

460
00:35:51,001 --> 00:35:52,001
He's gone.

461
00:35:55,006 --> 00:35:57,362
All right, you'll be...
You're gonna be all right.

462
00:36:12,576 --> 00:36:14,755
- What took you so long?
- Stopped for coffee.

463
00:36:15,999 --> 00:36:17,966
How many other Raptor teams made it?

464
00:36:18,327 --> 00:36:19,990
Haven't seen anybody else.

465
00:36:21,502 --> 00:36:23,640
Okay, back the way we came.
Guns. Point.

466
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:24,765
Yes, sir.

467
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,763
We're retracing our steps.

468
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:47,913
Say again, Apollo!

469
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:50,160
I cannot copy
your last transmission!

470
00:36:50,507 --> 00:36:51,708
This is the XO.

471
00:36:52,003 --> 00:36:53,943
Red stripes to repel boarders.

472
00:36:54,068 --> 00:36:56,416
Deck 21, portside, frame 10.

473
00:36:56,541 --> 00:36:58,507
<i>We got the prize!
Repeat, we have the prize!</i>

474
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:00,820
<i>Formed up with assault 2
and are heading back to base.</i>

475
00:37:00,945 --> 00:37:01,945
Roger that!

476
00:37:02,188 --> 00:37:04,679
ETA five minutes.
Actual out.

477
00:37:05,658 --> 00:37:06,598
Fire!

478
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:08,492
We got a fire up here!

479
00:37:11,673 --> 00:37:13,438
- Connect me to command unit!
- Yes, sir!

480
00:37:16,652 --> 00:37:19,384
Move reserved forces
to guard airlock.

481
00:37:19,509 --> 00:37:21,194
Assault force is en route.

482
00:37:21,319 --> 00:37:22,656
ETA five minutes.

483
00:37:23,013 --> 00:37:25,701
I repeat, ETA five minutes.

484
00:37:44,365 --> 00:37:45,615
We're friendly!

485
00:37:47,643 --> 00:37:49,467
Hold your fire!
Friendlies!

486
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:54,646
Rangel, Peters, form up!

487
00:37:57,885 --> 00:37:59,650
- Sorry 'bout that.
- Doc, you did good.

488
00:37:59,775 --> 00:38:01,378
- Thank you.
- We'll take Hera.

489
00:38:01,503 --> 00:38:02,503
Right.

490
00:38:02,829 --> 00:38:04,707
- Come on.
- Come on, bring Hera.

491
00:38:05,563 --> 00:38:06,935
Get him outta here.

492
00:38:11,676 --> 00:38:12,914
Fall back, fall back!

493
00:38:43,951 --> 00:38:44,951
What?

494
00:38:45,995 --> 00:38:46,995
Hera.

495
00:39:00,124 --> 00:39:01,124
Clear!

496
00:39:25,001 --> 00:39:25,895
Oh, God!

497
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:29,533
Check this out.
Keep that *** back here!

498
00:39:31,793 --> 00:39:32,798
Hang on.

499
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:42,921
- Hera!
- Hera, come back here!

500
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:44,923
- Hera!
- Look at me!

501
00:39:47,556 --> 00:39:48,928
- Go.
- No, you'll bleed out.

502
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:49,886
Go!

503
00:39:50,918 --> 00:39:51,918
Go!

504
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,160
I'm empty.

505
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:17,901
Two rounds.

506
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:51,707
I've been here before.

507
00:43:53,192 --> 00:43:54,047
Yes.

508
00:44:11,305 --> 00:44:14,328
- We're... we're supposed to...
- Go into the opera house.

509
00:45:19,439 --> 00:45:22,513
- This one's still alive!
- Get him the hell outta here!

510
00:45:23,596 --> 00:45:24,893
They got the girl.

511
00:45:25,374 --> 00:45:27,145
They've got the little girl!

512
00:45:36,837 --> 00:45:38,150
This makes it a lot easier.

513
00:45:38,473 --> 00:45:40,904
I just take the little girl
and I'm outta here.

514
00:45:41,073 --> 00:45:42,072
Not a chance.

515
00:45:46,551 --> 00:45:48,664
Cavil, we won't let you take Hera.
You know that.

516
00:45:48,789 --> 00:45:50,342
I know nothing of the kind.

517
00:45:50,467 --> 00:45:53,064
I know I'm gonna watch you
chase your tails across the universe

518
00:45:53,189 --> 00:45:55,210
- for another four years.
- That's not gonna happen.

519
00:45:58,546 --> 00:46:02,218
This thing is the key to my people's
survival and I'm not leaving without it.

520
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:03,762
Hera's not a thing.

521
00:46:04,469 --> 00:46:05,705
She's a child.

522
00:46:06,562 --> 00:46:09,080
And she holds the key
to humanity's survival as well.

523
00:46:09,205 --> 00:46:10,432
And how do you know that?

524
00:46:19,711 --> 00:46:20,777
I see angels.

525
00:46:22,906 --> 00:46:24,364
Angels in this very room.

526
00:46:25,529 --> 00:46:26,903
Now I may be mad.

527
00:46:27,767 --> 00:46:29,944
But that doesn't mean
that I'm not right.

528
00:46:31,177 --> 00:46:33,467
Because there's another force
at work here.

529
00:46:34,233 --> 00:46:35,682
There always has been.

530
00:46:35,853 --> 00:46:37,593
It's undeniable.
We've all experienced it.

531
00:46:37,718 --> 00:46:40,994
Everyone in this room has witnessed
events that they can't fathom,

532
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:43,462
let alone explain away
by rational means.

533
00:46:44,729 --> 00:46:47,599
Puzzles deciphered in prophecy.

534
00:46:48,689 --> 00:46:50,640
Dreams given to a chosen few.

535
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:54,164
Our loved ones dead.

536
00:46:55,778 --> 00:46:56,521
Risen.

537
00:46:59,939 --> 00:47:01,756
Whether we wanna call
that "God" or "Gods",

538
00:47:01,881 --> 00:47:05,151
or some sublime inspiration
or a divine force

539
00:47:05,276 --> 00:47:08,649
that we can't know or understand,
it doesn't matter... It doesn't matter.

540
00:47:08,774 --> 00:47:09,774
It's here.

541
00:47:10,463 --> 00:47:11,593
It exists.

542
00:47:13,069 --> 00:47:16,374
And our two destinies
are entwined in its force.

543
00:47:21,105 --> 00:47:23,760
If that were true...
and that's a big "if"...

544
00:47:24,664 --> 00:47:28,542
how do I know this force
has our best interests in mind?

545
00:47:29,144 --> 00:47:31,862
How do you know
that God is on your side, Doctor?

546
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:34,650
I don't.

547
00:47:36,901 --> 00:47:39,314
God's not on any one side.

548
00:47:41,624 --> 00:47:43,312
God's a force of nature...

549
00:47:43,988 --> 00:47:45,438
beyond good and evil.

550
00:47:46,694 --> 00:47:48,648
Good and evil, we created those.

551
00:47:50,321 --> 00:47:52,016
And we'll break the cycle.

552
00:47:53,124 --> 00:47:54,871
Break the cycle of birth,

553
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:56,687
death, rebirth,

554
00:47:57,166 --> 00:47:59,276
destruction, escape, death.

555
00:48:01,322 --> 00:48:03,108
Well, that's in our hands...

556
00:48:03,729 --> 00:48:05,149
and our hands only.

557
00:48:07,732 --> 00:48:09,344
Requires a leap of faith.

558
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:13,052
Requires that we live in hope...

559
00:48:13,931 --> 00:48:14,931
not fear.

560
00:48:15,436 --> 00:48:16,686
If I leave you this girl,

561
00:48:17,473 --> 00:48:19,812
that means
the destruction of my people.

562
00:48:20,402 --> 00:48:24,310
How does our extinction fit into this
picture that you want us to believe in?

563
00:48:25,292 --> 00:48:26,861
We'll give you resurrection.

564
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:29,447
Saul!

565
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:36,350
You give us Hera
and we will give you resurrection.

566
00:48:37,339 --> 00:48:38,748
But the war ends here.

567
00:48:40,564 --> 00:48:42,396
You leave humanity in peace...

568
00:48:43,084 --> 00:48:45,797
and give up the pursuit now
and for all time.

569
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,560
Agreed.

570
00:48:51,263 --> 00:48:53,386
How do we know
we can take your word for it?

571
00:48:53,636 --> 00:48:54,636
You don't.

572
00:48:55,183 --> 00:48:57,054
You have to make a leap of faith.

573
00:48:57,179 --> 00:48:59,393
It's your call, Bill.
I'll back you either way.

574
00:49:01,225 --> 00:49:03,231
I'm losing a lot of men out there.

575
00:49:03,645 --> 00:49:05,537
I can do something
about that right now.

576
00:49:05,662 --> 00:49:08,194
- Give me that phone.
- Patch him through.

577
00:49:13,265 --> 00:49:14,409
Hello, it's me, Cavil.

578
00:49:15,913 --> 00:49:18,913
Stand down!
All forces cease fire immediately.

579
00:49:26,497 --> 00:49:27,867
Galactica, Hotdog.

580
00:49:28,619 --> 00:49:30,091
<i>They're pulling back.</i>

581
00:49:30,259 --> 00:49:31,759
<i>Repeat.
They're pulling back!</i>

582
00:49:34,901 --> 00:49:37,939
Everyone... stand down.

583
00:49:46,339 --> 00:49:47,988
I'm as good as my word.

584
00:50:24,466 --> 00:50:25,529
Admiral...

585
00:50:25,732 --> 00:50:28,283
Viper wing's aboard.
We lost four birds.

586
00:50:29,053 --> 00:50:31,908
Assault force is aboard.
We've lost seven Raptors.

587
00:50:52,122 --> 00:50:53,257
What are they doing?

588
00:50:53,426 --> 00:50:54,851
Each of them knows

589
00:50:55,422 --> 00:50:57,341
part of the secret to resurrection.

590
00:50:57,466 --> 00:50:58,971
They're gonna interact

591
00:50:59,096 --> 00:51:01,840
with the dataflow in the water.

592
00:51:01,965 --> 00:51:03,184
And... I don't know.

593
00:51:03,624 --> 00:51:05,788
It's a lotta complicated
technical talk

594
00:51:05,913 --> 00:51:08,030
about sharing the information
among the five of them

595
00:51:08,155 --> 00:51:10,652
and then transferring it
over to the Colony somehow.

596
00:51:11,589 --> 00:51:12,694
Now, for a moment,

597
00:51:13,014 --> 00:51:15,434
we're going to know everything
there is to know about one another.

598
00:51:15,559 --> 00:51:17,038
Looking forward to that.

599
00:51:18,278 --> 00:51:19,701
There are certain things that...

600
00:51:21,513 --> 00:51:22,595
That we've all done.

601
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,677
Certain things that...

602
00:51:24,802 --> 00:51:27,341
people would be shocked
to learn about.

603
00:51:27,466 --> 00:51:31,421
Hey, I don't mean to rush you, but you
are keeping two civilizations waiting!

604
00:51:34,279 --> 00:51:36,967
Let's...
let's just all agree that no matter...

605
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:39,345
what we learn about each other,

606
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:43,591
we're all Cylons, and we're
all capable of making mistakes.

607
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:47,353
You're forgiven
for all your dark secrets.

608
00:51:47,715 --> 00:51:48,917
Let's do this.

609
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,240
Any word?

610
00:52:13,836 --> 00:52:16,424
We're getting the data now.
It looks right.

611
00:52:16,549 --> 00:52:18,925
They're downloading
the resurrection designs now.

612
00:53:11,643 --> 00:53:14,548
- They've broken off the download.
- It's a trick! Open fire!

613
00:53:28,363 --> 00:53:29,363
Frak!

614
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:21,320
We've gotta get outta here!
Starbuck, jump the ship!

615
00:54:26,234 --> 00:54:28,097
I don't have
the rendezvous coordinates!

616
00:54:28,266 --> 00:54:30,922
Doesn't matter!
Just jump us out of here now!

617
00:54:31,253 --> 00:54:32,143
Jump!

618
00:54:36,935 --> 00:54:38,371
Just trust yourself.

619
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:43,303
There must be some kind
of way out of here.

620
00:55:01,499 --> 00:55:04,904
I thought that if I assign
numbers to the notes...

621
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:16,978
If that's me lying there,
then what am I?

622
00:55:20,526 --> 00:55:22,860
When I look at you now,
I don't see Kara Thrace. I see...

623
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:25,112
an angel blazing
with the light of God.

624
00:55:25,722 --> 00:55:26,836
Angel.

625
00:55:45,636 --> 00:55:46,811
Jump!

626
00:55:53,896 --> 00:55:55,482
You're tempting fate.

627
00:55:56,894 --> 00:55:59,106
If I have a fate, then it is set

628
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:01,857
and thinking about it
isn't gonna make it happen any faster.

629
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:04,152
Fair enough. But flying...

630
00:56:04,807 --> 00:56:06,942
when you're thinking
about dying and...

631
00:56:07,067 --> 00:56:09,234
It's a bad way of doing business.

632
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:12,650
You're gonna get scared and you're
gonna start second guessing yourself.

633
00:56:12,775 --> 00:56:14,454
I'm not scared.

634
00:56:16,043 --> 00:56:18,102
You said that you think about...

635
00:56:18,227 --> 00:56:20,609
dying every time
that you get into a cockpit.

636
00:56:22,578 --> 00:56:23,784
Well, hello?

637
00:56:24,785 --> 00:56:28,174
Yeah, but it doesn't scare me.
Like, that's what you don't get.

638
00:56:31,378 --> 00:56:32,659
What, so it's...

639
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:36,252
Kara Thrace, the fearless warrior,

640
00:56:37,312 --> 00:56:38,312
right?

641
00:56:42,416 --> 00:56:44,626
No, I know... I know fear.

642
00:56:45,919 --> 00:56:47,560
And I get scared. Just...

643
00:56:48,574 --> 00:56:49,932
Just not of dying.

644
00:56:53,762 --> 00:56:55,793
So then what does scare you?

645
00:57:03,852 --> 00:57:04,856
Sorry.

646
00:57:07,045 --> 00:57:08,369
Being forgotten.

647
00:58:08,038 --> 00:58:10,168
- You all right?
- I am fine.

648
00:58:14,418 --> 00:58:16,045
- XO?
- Sir?

649
00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:17,785
Sitrep.
Damage report.

650
00:58:18,731 --> 00:58:20,619
I'm okay.
I'm okay, go.

651
00:58:20,744 --> 00:58:21,539
Sir.

652
00:58:36,075 --> 00:58:37,479
We're mostly here.

653
00:58:38,696 --> 00:58:41,232
The engines... life support...

654
00:58:44,205 --> 00:58:45,696
But there's red lines

655
00:58:46,274 --> 00:58:48,792
through her lateral
structural members.

656
00:58:53,243 --> 00:58:54,822
She's broke her back.

657
00:58:55,093 --> 00:58:56,824
She'll never jump again.

658
00:58:58,810 --> 00:59:01,649
Wherever we are
is where we're gonna stay.

659
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:09,984
Where have you taken us, Kara?

660
01:00:15,146 --> 01:00:17,100
Glad you could join us, Admiral.

661
01:00:17,702 --> 01:00:19,531
Lieutenant Hoshi suits
me just fine, sir.

662
01:00:20,692 --> 01:00:23,303
Admiral stars turned out
to be a little heavy.

663
01:00:24,176 --> 01:00:27,664
Happiest day of my life when I saw that
Raptor jump into the rendezvous point.

664
01:00:27,834 --> 01:00:29,829
Well, there you have it, Admiral.

665
01:00:30,453 --> 01:00:33,842
The most advanced civilization
we could locate on this planet.

666
01:00:39,823 --> 01:00:41,595
I can't see them
talking to each other.

667
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:45,099
So either they communicate
a different way or they're pre-verbal.

668
01:00:45,294 --> 01:00:49,144
Judging by the look of their tools,
which are rudimentary to say the least,

669
01:00:49,572 --> 01:00:53,232
I'd suggest that we've found
an early, ritualistic, tribal society.

670
01:00:53,891 --> 01:00:55,311
They bury their dead.

671
01:00:56,030 --> 01:00:59,405
I came across a grave a couple
of clicks back and ran some tests.

672
01:01:00,111 --> 01:01:02,357
Their DNA is compatible with ours.

673
01:01:02,482 --> 01:01:04,402
Meaning we can breed with them.

674
01:01:05,421 --> 01:01:07,329
You got a one-track mind, Doc.

675
01:01:07,715 --> 01:01:08,728
What?

676
01:01:08,853 --> 01:01:11,850
Listen, I'm talking about the survival
of the human race, actually.

677
01:01:11,975 --> 01:01:14,355
Not some get together
with the natives.

678
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,700
You also have no sense of humor.

679
01:01:20,113 --> 01:01:21,113
Right.

680
01:01:21,943 --> 01:01:23,225
Right, I'm sorry.

681
01:01:24,603 --> 01:01:25,988
How's that possible?

682
01:01:26,667 --> 01:01:29,810
Human beings naturally evolved

683
01:01:29,935 --> 01:01:33,022
on a planet
one million light years away.

684
01:01:33,410 --> 01:01:36,250
- The odds against that are...
- Astronomical, yeah.

685
01:01:38,730 --> 01:01:41,684
One might even say
there was a divine hand at work.

686
01:01:42,454 --> 01:01:43,454
Well,

687
01:01:44,072 --> 01:01:46,637
whoever's responsible, we're here.

688
01:01:47,526 --> 01:01:49,679
And here's where we're gonna stay...

689
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:53,035
With our new families.

690
01:02:08,444 --> 01:02:11,477
My vote is that we clear
everything back to this ridge.

691
01:02:11,715 --> 01:02:14,532
Easy access to the water
down by the river.

692
01:02:14,657 --> 01:02:16,852
In fact, the whole area's
ripe for cultivation.

693
01:02:16,977 --> 01:02:20,503
We should have the preliminary lines
for a city within a day or two.

694
01:02:20,979 --> 01:02:21,979
No.

695
01:02:24,409 --> 01:02:25,409
No city.

696
01:02:26,769 --> 01:02:28,021
Not this time.

697
01:02:32,363 --> 01:02:34,042
What do you propose we do?

698
01:02:39,604 --> 01:02:40,672
We break the cycle.

699
01:02:42,484 --> 01:02:44,713
We leave it all behind
and start over.

700
01:02:46,353 --> 01:02:49,416
You're talking about
a little over 38,000 people...

701
01:02:49,541 --> 01:02:51,210
The entire human race...

702
01:02:52,478 --> 01:02:56,246
With nothing but the clothes
on their backs and some provisions.

703
01:02:56,804 --> 01:02:58,804
It's not the entire human race.

704
01:02:59,791 --> 01:03:02,201
- There are people already here.
- Tribal.

705
01:03:03,104 --> 01:03:04,723
Without language even.

706
01:03:05,667 --> 01:03:07,355
But we can give them that.

707
01:03:08,541 --> 01:03:10,446
I mean, we can give them the...

708
01:03:11,823 --> 01:03:13,247
The best part of ourselves.

709
01:03:14,609 --> 01:03:16,915
But not the baggage.
Not the ships, the equipment,

710
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:18,544
the technology, the weapons.

711
01:03:19,152 --> 01:03:22,205
If there's one thing
that we should've learned, it's that...

712
01:03:23,245 --> 01:03:26,977
you know, our brains
have always outraced our hearts.

713
01:03:27,102 --> 01:03:28,622
Our science charges ahead.

714
01:03:28,747 --> 01:03:31,770
Our souls lag behind.

715
01:03:34,802 --> 01:03:36,131
Let's start a new.

716
01:03:49,718 --> 01:03:52,229
We'll land civilians
at various points

717
01:03:53,154 --> 01:03:54,489
around the planet.

718
01:03:55,414 --> 01:03:59,061
Our objective will be to spread
the people out as much as possible

719
01:03:59,186 --> 01:04:01,788
to give them
the best possibility of survival.

720
01:04:02,916 --> 01:04:05,766
Supplies will be evenly
distributed throughout the camps.

721
01:04:05,913 --> 01:04:09,225
And locations will be documented
and given to everyone.

722
01:04:09,350 --> 01:04:10,777
I have to say, I'm shocked

723
01:04:10,902 --> 01:04:14,001
at how amenable
everyone is to this notion.

724
01:04:14,754 --> 01:04:17,686
I would have thought there'd be
general uprising at the idea of losing

725
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:19,789
whatever little creature comforts
we had left.

726
01:04:19,914 --> 01:04:23,617
Don't underestimate the desire
for a clean slate, Mr. Lampkin.

727
01:04:25,123 --> 01:04:26,664
Have you made a decision?

728
01:04:26,789 --> 01:04:29,425
The Sixes, the Eights and the Twos

729
01:04:29,563 --> 01:04:31,685
have decided to stay.

730
01:04:32,166 --> 01:04:36,002
See how we can contribute to the world
before we pass into God's hands.

731
01:04:36,883 --> 01:04:38,804
We'll give the baseship
to the Centurions,

732
01:04:38,929 --> 01:04:40,850
let them find their own destiny.

733
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:43,977
I think they've earned
their freedom.

734
01:04:44,102 --> 01:04:46,124
And what if they evolve again
on their own

735
01:04:46,249 --> 01:04:49,760
and decide to come back
in a few hundred years and wipe us out?

736
01:04:49,929 --> 01:04:51,047
It's a risk.

737
01:04:51,172 --> 01:04:54,970
But I think setting them free may be
enough to break the cycle of violence.

738
01:04:55,095 --> 01:04:56,927
And it's a risk worth taking.

739
01:04:58,395 --> 01:04:59,475
And I agree.

740
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,209
They've earned it.

741
01:05:02,364 --> 01:05:05,324
Now once the civilians
have been off-loaded,

742
01:05:05,449 --> 01:05:08,913
the fleet will leave the orbit
and rendezvous with Galactica.

743
01:05:09,075 --> 01:05:12,915
The course of the fleet will be plotted
into the nav computer ahead of time.

744
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:16,004
But the actual piloting
will be done by Mr. Anders.

745
01:05:16,967 --> 01:05:20,280
He'll guide the entire fleet
directly into the sun.

746
01:06:55,764 --> 01:06:57,287
I love you.

747
01:07:05,113 --> 01:07:07,999
Good-bye... Sam.

748
01:07:25,724 --> 01:07:27,644
I'll see you on the other side.

749
01:08:28,919 --> 01:08:30,439
Is your name William Adama?

750
01:08:30,731 --> 01:08:31,731
Yes.

751
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:35,017
Are you an officer
in the Colonial fleet?

752
01:08:35,142 --> 01:08:36,142
Yes.

753
01:08:37,169 --> 01:08:38,196
Are you a Cylon?

754
01:08:41,615 --> 01:08:44,767
I'm sorry, Bill. We're still
establishing tests for the control.

755
01:08:44,892 --> 01:08:47,133
I need verifiable yeses and nos.

756
01:08:50,263 --> 01:08:52,307
No. I'm not a Cylon.

757
01:08:53,949 --> 01:08:56,504
Have you ever stolen money
from a cash drawer?

758
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:02,052
- Have you ever stolen money...
- Enough of this crap.

759
01:09:02,177 --> 01:09:03,954
Take this thing off me right now.

760
01:09:04,233 --> 01:09:08,166
No job is worth this,
no matter how fat the paycheck is.

761
01:09:08,998 --> 01:09:11,354
I'd rather spend the rest of my career,
what's left of it,

762
01:09:12,523 --> 01:09:14,149
on a broken down old ship

763
01:09:14,472 --> 01:09:15,972
than have someone sit here

764
01:09:16,811 --> 01:09:18,481
and question my word.

765
01:09:54,555 --> 01:09:55,649
Perfection.

766
01:09:57,023 --> 01:09:58,673
That's what it's about.

767
01:10:00,071 --> 01:10:01,517
It's those moments...

768
01:10:03,205 --> 01:10:06,722
when you can feel
the perfection of creation.

769
01:10:08,862 --> 01:10:11,948
The beauty of physics, you know?

770
01:10:12,073 --> 01:10:14,036
The wonder of mathematics.

771
01:10:14,161 --> 01:10:16,679
The elation of action

772
01:10:17,411 --> 01:10:18,411
and reaction.

773
01:10:18,536 --> 01:10:21,733
And that is the kind of perfection
that I wanna be connected to.

774
01:10:54,754 --> 01:10:56,798
You sure this is what you want,
Galen?

775
01:10:58,120 --> 01:10:59,289
Yeah, I'm sure.

776
01:11:00,102 --> 01:11:01,522
Just tired of people.

777
01:11:01,888 --> 01:11:03,675
Human, Cylons, whatever.

778
01:11:04,077 --> 01:11:05,610
Last Raptor is gonna drop me off

779
01:11:05,735 --> 01:11:08,680
on this island that I found off
one of the northern continents.

780
01:11:09,242 --> 01:11:11,510
It's cold.
It's up in the highlands.

781
01:11:12,966 --> 01:11:14,366
There's no people.

782
01:11:27,602 --> 01:11:28,522
Good luck.

783
01:11:29,557 --> 01:11:31,411
For what it's worth,
if what happened

784
01:11:31,579 --> 01:11:34,664
to Cally had happened to Ellen,
I'd have done the same frakking thing.

785
01:11:56,335 --> 01:11:57,995
I thought Bill was coming.

786
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:01,245
- He's taking a leak.
- Oh, nice.

787
01:12:03,194 --> 01:12:05,820
Order me a drink, honey.
Keep 'em coming.

788
01:12:06,926 --> 01:12:09,574
Tonight we are celebrating
your retirement

789
01:12:09,742 --> 01:12:13,370
and all the time I'm about to get
to spend with my husband.

790
01:12:15,162 --> 01:12:16,790
Are you good with that?

791
01:12:19,548 --> 01:12:21,003
All I've ever wanted

792
01:12:21,491 --> 01:12:22,977
was to be with you.

793
01:12:23,902 --> 01:12:27,906
Not just weekend liberties
or two week's leave a year.

794
01:12:28,093 --> 01:12:29,989
I mean full-time.

795
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:31,630
You and me.

796
01:12:32,559 --> 01:12:35,596
Together in a house, in a tent.

797
01:12:36,678 --> 01:12:38,455
Homeless and on the street.

798
01:12:39,830 --> 01:12:41,267
Just be together.

799
01:12:44,138 --> 01:12:45,173
Excuse me.

800
01:12:48,950 --> 01:12:50,182
Don't drop me!

801
01:12:51,370 --> 01:12:52,367
To us!

802
01:13:32,102 --> 01:13:34,860
They're so many.

803
01:13:35,838 --> 01:13:36,578
Wait!

804
01:13:37,124 --> 01:13:38,204
I wanna...

805
01:13:39,610 --> 01:13:40,707
see more detail.

806
01:14:02,883 --> 01:14:03,767
It's...

807
01:14:05,669 --> 01:14:08,026
a very beautiful world.

808
01:14:12,339 --> 01:14:13,705
Does it have a name?

809
01:14:17,589 --> 01:14:18,495
Earth.

810
01:14:23,776 --> 01:14:25,008
It's not Earth.

811
01:14:27,071 --> 01:14:28,455
Earth is a dream.

812
01:14:31,294 --> 01:14:33,848
One we've been chasing
for a long time.

813
01:14:36,017 --> 01:14:37,946
We've earned it. This is Earth.

814
01:14:38,839 --> 01:14:39,839
Okay then.

815
01:14:41,098 --> 01:14:42,098
Earth.

816
01:14:44,437 --> 01:14:45,437
It's fine.

817
01:14:49,905 --> 01:14:51,753
I'm having trouble...

818
01:14:52,718 --> 01:14:53,726
breathing.

819
01:15:13,253 --> 01:15:15,432
Would you like to get
a better look at them?

820
01:15:23,816 --> 01:15:25,128
Yes, I'd...

821
01:15:25,593 --> 01:15:26,593
love it.

822
01:15:27,816 --> 01:15:28,816
I would.

823
01:15:34,098 --> 01:15:35,509
- Watch.
- What?

824
01:15:36,282 --> 01:15:38,672
- Why? What are you doing?
- Watch me.

825
01:15:40,172 --> 01:15:43,163
- What are you doing?
- Put your arm around me. Can you?

826
01:16:19,398 --> 01:16:20,398
Dad?

827
01:16:21,175 --> 01:16:23,075
I don't have much time, son.

828
01:16:24,987 --> 01:16:26,106
I understand.

829
01:16:44,211 --> 01:16:45,808
What do you hear, Starbuck?

830
01:16:47,247 --> 01:16:48,603
Nothing but the rain.

831
01:16:49,566 --> 01:16:51,940
Grab your gun and bring in the cat.

832
01:17:02,517 --> 01:17:03,696
You should go.

833
01:17:56,221 --> 01:17:58,988
You know,
my very earliest memory of my father

834
01:18:00,247 --> 01:18:02,533
was him flying away on a big plane.

835
01:18:05,631 --> 01:18:07,881
And wondering
when he was coming back.

836
01:18:13,143 --> 01:18:14,731
He's not coming back this time.

837
01:18:15,161 --> 01:18:16,161
No,

838
01:18:16,929 --> 01:18:18,107
he's not.

839
01:18:23,839 --> 01:18:24,782
Neither am I.

840
01:18:27,929 --> 01:18:29,268
Where are you going?

841
01:18:31,045 --> 01:18:32,259
I don't know.

842
01:18:33,893 --> 01:18:36,205
I just know that I'm done here.

843
01:18:38,214 --> 01:18:40,071
I've completed my journey

844
01:18:42,161 --> 01:18:43,561
and it feels good.

845
01:18:56,237 --> 01:18:57,322
You and I...

846
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:00,190
Right here...

847
01:19:01,817 --> 01:19:02,817
Right now.

848
01:19:06,764 --> 01:19:07,914
On the table?

849
01:19:11,598 --> 01:19:12,648
I dare you.

850
01:19:14,590 --> 01:19:16,190
I double-dog dare you.

851
01:19:17,474 --> 01:19:20,027
- Double-dog dare?
- Oh, yeah. Double-dog.

852
01:19:27,455 --> 01:19:28,346
All right.

853
01:19:52,531 --> 01:19:53,981
Something's broken.

854
01:20:12,964 --> 01:20:15,464
I guess I better... get going.

855
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:39,870
It was nice to meet you...

856
01:20:41,174 --> 01:20:42,174
Lee Adama.

857
01:20:49,792 --> 01:20:51,818
Likewise, Kara Thrace.

858
01:21:01,659 --> 01:21:03,059
So what about you?

859
01:21:05,284 --> 01:21:06,884
What are you gonna do?

860
01:21:08,329 --> 01:21:09,329
Today

861
01:21:09,864 --> 01:21:12,873
is the first day
of the rest of your life, Lee.

862
01:21:17,373 --> 01:21:18,373
Well...

863
01:21:20,695 --> 01:21:23,745
I always thought
when this was all done I would...

864
01:21:25,831 --> 01:21:26,813
kick back.

865
01:21:28,090 --> 01:21:29,090
Relax.

866
01:21:30,679 --> 01:21:34,683
Spend the rest of my days doing
the absolute minimum humanly possible.

867
01:21:36,817 --> 01:21:39,103
And now that you're here?

868
01:21:40,771 --> 01:21:42,171
I want to explore!

869
01:21:43,388 --> 01:21:45,288
I wanna climb the mountains.

870
01:21:46,210 --> 01:21:49,031
I wanna cross the oceans.
I wanna...

871
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:51,945
I can't believe I'm saying this.
It sounds so exhausting.

872
01:21:52,070 --> 01:21:53,370
I must be crazy.

873
01:22:17,131 --> 01:22:18,381
Good-bye, Kara.

874
01:22:22,461 --> 01:22:24,111
You won't be forgotten.

875
01:23:13,307 --> 01:23:14,307
You okay?

876
01:23:38,088 --> 01:23:40,238
Sean, it's been a lovely evening.

877
01:23:40,385 --> 01:23:41,585
Really lovely.

878
01:23:43,974 --> 01:23:46,437
But I'm afraid
we won't be doing this again.

879
01:23:47,661 --> 01:23:49,224
- Did I...
- No.

880
01:23:49,420 --> 01:23:51,698
No, not you.
No, you're wonderful.

881
01:23:52,547 --> 01:23:54,210
- Come on then...
- No.

882
01:23:56,419 --> 01:23:58,116
You can show yourself out.

883
01:23:59,221 --> 01:24:00,326
I'm sorry.

884
01:24:47,064 --> 01:24:48,624
Hello, this is Laura Roslin.

885
01:24:48,792 --> 01:24:51,897
I'd like you to give a message to...

886
01:24:52,495 --> 01:24:53,652
Mayor Adar.

887
01:24:54,701 --> 01:24:56,344
Tell him that I will...

888
01:24:57,862 --> 01:24:59,621
be joining his campaign.

889
01:25:00,532 --> 01:25:01,496
Thank you.

890
01:25:06,067 --> 01:25:07,612
All the way to the end.

891
01:25:08,862 --> 01:25:10,112
No matter what.

892
01:25:11,549 --> 01:25:13,014
All the way to the end.

893
01:25:20,014 --> 01:25:21,417
So much...

894
01:25:23,971 --> 01:25:24,971
life.

895
01:25:27,578 --> 01:25:29,178
It's a rich continent.

896
01:25:35,534 --> 01:25:39,091
More wildlife
than all the 12 Colonies put together.

897
01:25:50,684 --> 01:25:53,559
Just looking for a quiet little place
for that cabin.

898
01:25:58,002 --> 01:25:59,171
Maybe a garden.

899
01:26:00,475 --> 01:26:03,671
I don't have much of a green thumb,
so I hope that you do.

900
01:26:58,232 --> 01:26:59,332
Right there.

901
01:27:00,223 --> 01:27:02,049
I'm gonna build it right there,
Laura.

902
01:28:05,708 --> 01:28:07,558
Lot of game on this planet.

903
01:28:09,717 --> 01:28:12,994
- I'm a pretty good hunter, you know?
- Yeah, right.

904
01:28:13,766 --> 01:28:16,114
What are you laughing at?
What?

905
01:28:16,355 --> 01:28:18,409
That buck on Caprica.

906
01:28:19,007 --> 01:28:21,828
Okay, come on now.
That's not fair.

907
01:28:23,087 --> 01:28:25,935
Don't you listen to mommy.
Daddy is a great hunter.

908
01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:28,801
No, mommy's gonna teach you
how to hunt.

909
01:28:29,391 --> 01:28:30,541
Real hunting.

910
01:28:31,355 --> 01:28:34,417
And I'm gonna teach you
how to build a house

911
01:28:34,542 --> 01:28:35,768
and how to plant crops.

912
01:28:36,325 --> 01:28:39,855
Okay, maybe mommy will teach you that,
but daddy's gonna teach you how to hunt.

913
01:28:53,185 --> 01:28:54,185
Hera...

914
01:28:55,729 --> 01:28:57,329
will she be all right?

915
01:28:58,131 --> 01:28:59,500
She survived.

916
01:29:00,060 --> 01:29:02,086
- Thanks to you.
- Both of you.

917
01:29:03,604 --> 01:29:04,899
And that's it?

918
01:29:05,345 --> 01:29:06,799
That's all God wants of us?

919
01:29:07,810 --> 01:29:09,385
God's plan is never complete.

920
01:29:10,810 --> 01:29:13,506
- Great.
- But I think it's safe to say...

921
01:29:14,471 --> 01:29:17,730
that from now on
your lives will be less...

922
01:29:18,783 --> 01:29:19,770
eventful.

923
01:30:00,213 --> 01:30:01,353
I've been thinking.

924
01:30:01,597 --> 01:30:03,963
I may be able
to help you out after all.

925
01:30:05,182 --> 01:30:07,851
About that thing
you were asking about before.

926
01:30:10,369 --> 01:30:13,432
Getting a peek
into the defense mainframe.

927
01:30:15,191 --> 01:30:18,217
- It would mean a lot to my employers.
- I'm not doing it for employers.

928
01:30:18,342 --> 01:30:20,775
I'm doing it for you.
How would it make you feel?

929
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:24,877
I'd be very grateful.

930
01:30:26,168 --> 01:30:28,018
We'll put that to the test.

931
01:30:29,266 --> 01:30:32,051
Because if anyone finds out,
I could get my head cut off.

932
01:30:33,212 --> 01:30:34,998
So I'll count on your discretion.

933
01:30:40,168 --> 01:30:41,864
The things men do for love.

934
01:30:43,132 --> 01:30:44,132
Love?

935
01:30:47,672 --> 01:30:49,225
Yeah, well. You know...

936
01:30:50,073 --> 01:30:51,868
You know what I mean, don't you?

937
01:31:08,797 --> 01:31:11,047
Over there between those two peaks.

938
01:31:12,484 --> 01:31:15,475
I saw some terrain
that looked good for cultivation.

939
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:16,700
Cultivation?

940
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:18,520
Yes.

941
01:31:22,827 --> 01:31:24,877
You know, I know about farming.

942
01:31:32,412 --> 01:31:33,430
I know.

943
01:31:41,376 --> 01:31:42,576
I know you do.

944
01:31:49,769 --> 01:31:51,510
I laid out the cabin today.

945
01:31:52,555 --> 01:31:54,760
It's gonna have an easterly view.

946
01:31:56,733 --> 01:31:59,383
You should see the light
that we get here.

947
01:31:59,617 --> 01:32:02,307
When the sun comes
from behind those mountains...

948
01:32:03,766 --> 01:32:05,274
It's almost heavenly.

949
01:32:08,239 --> 01:32:09,685
It reminds me of you.

950
01:33:11,081 --> 01:33:15,085
"At a scientific conference this week
at the Smithsonian in Washington,

951
01:33:15,510 --> 01:33:18,348
"the startling announcement was made
that archeologists believe

952
01:33:18,473 --> 01:33:21,205
"they have found fossilized remains
of a young woman

953
01:33:21,330 --> 01:33:23,956
"who may actually be
Mitochondrial Eve.

954
01:33:24,205 --> 01:33:26,606
"Mitochondrial Eve is the name
scientists have given

955
01:33:26,731 --> 01:33:30,735
"to the most recent common ancestor
for human beings now living on Earth.

956
01:33:31,550 --> 01:33:33,773
"She lived in what is now Tanzania,

957
01:33:34,567 --> 01:33:36,960
"over 150,000 years ago."

958
01:33:38,996 --> 01:33:40,781
Along with her Cylon mother.

959
01:33:41,264 --> 01:33:42,614
And human father.

960
01:33:47,122 --> 01:33:50,312
Commercialism, decadence,
technology run amok.

961
01:33:50,804 --> 01:33:53,504
- Remind you of anything?
- Take your pick.

962
01:33:54,089 --> 01:33:55,089
Kobol,

963
01:33:55,571 --> 01:33:56,571
Earth...

964
01:33:57,152 --> 01:33:59,143
The real Earth before this one.

965
01:33:59,777 --> 01:34:01,446
Caprica before the fall.

966
01:34:02,468 --> 01:34:05,781
- All of this has happened before...
- But the question remains.

967
01:34:07,138 --> 01:34:09,513
Does all of this
have to happen again?

968
01:34:09,897 --> 01:34:11,218
This time, I bet no.

969
01:34:11,343 --> 01:34:13,959
Never known you to play the optimist.
Why the change of heart?

970
01:34:14,084 --> 01:34:15,857
Mathematics, law of averages.

971
01:34:16,380 --> 01:34:18,699
Let a complex system
repeat itself long enough,

972
01:34:18,824 --> 01:34:21,358
eventually something surprising
might occur.

973
01:34:21,937 --> 01:34:23,907
That too is in God's plan.

974
01:34:26,723 --> 01:34:28,245
You know it doesn't like that name.

975
01:34:31,679 --> 01:34:32,795
Silly me.

976
01:34:34,027 --> 01:34:36,107
Silly, silly me.

977
01:35:29,473 --> 01:35:31,623
Frakking series finale.
So say we all!

978
01:35:31,790 --> 01:35:33,718
