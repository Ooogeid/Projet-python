<i>Previously on </i>
Battlestar Galactica...

2
00:00:03,642 --> 00:00:05,671
What am I?
A ghost, a demon?

3
00:00:05,924 --> 00:00:08,299
You're asking the wrong guy.
I'm just a piano player.

4
00:00:08,468 --> 00:00:10,034
- That for me?
- Here.

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:11,830
Holy crap.

6
00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:16,640
Sam!

7
00:00:19,954 --> 00:00:22,438
- There's a lot still going on in there.
- And there is nothing

8
00:00:22,607 --> 00:00:25,358
to indicate that's he's having
any kind of conscious thought.

9
00:00:25,527 --> 00:00:28,267
What if we could link him
to the data stream? Like our hybrids?

10
00:00:28,392 --> 00:00:31,405
We have to figure out
a contingency plan for the ship now.

11
00:00:33,203 --> 00:00:36,205
You have to face the fact
that you're gonna lose her.

12
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,846
Boomer's loose.
She's got my frakkin' kid!

13
00:00:39,332 --> 00:00:41,456
Get on the horn to CIC
and alert the Admiral.

14
00:00:41,581 --> 00:00:43,959
- Sir, Boomer's spooling to jump.
- If she jumps,

15
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:47,344
the spatial disruption
could tear Galactica's guts out.

16
00:01:28,983 --> 00:01:30,589
What have you been bitching about?

17
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:33,020
It's not our fault the resin
won't bond with your alloys.

18
00:01:33,145 --> 00:01:35,761
In other words, it's our fault that
this goop of yours isn't doing crap,

19
00:01:36,227 --> 00:01:38,973
except making this place
smell like the inside of a latrine.

20
00:01:39,204 --> 00:01:41,434
Really? I thought that was you.

21
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:44,767
Lady, you work on your side,
and I'll work on mine!

22
00:01:44,892 --> 00:01:45,892
Come on.

23
00:01:47,018 --> 00:01:49,018
Come on, not with this guy. Not now.

24
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:51,328
- Stop your bitching!
- Not now.

25
00:01:51,453 --> 00:01:53,696
- Fine! Fine!
- Come on, let's go.

26
00:02:03,266 --> 00:02:06,124
If John's plan all along was
to steal Hera so he could study her...

27
00:02:06,586 --> 00:02:09,830
Study her? They're gonna dissect her
like a lab rat and we all know it.

28
00:02:09,955 --> 00:02:11,798
If he wants to try to determine

29
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:14,642
what made her
a successful human/Cylon hybrid,

30
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:16,717
he'll take her to the Colony.

31
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,470
The Colony?

32
00:02:19,157 --> 00:02:21,207
I guess you could call it home.

33
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:24,518
It's where we and the Centurions
went after the first war,

34
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:27,747
once we convinced them
to abandon their own experiments

35
00:02:27,872 --> 00:02:30,970
with evolution in exchange
for resurrection technology.

36
00:02:31,534 --> 00:02:33,134
She knows where it is.

37
00:02:38,217 --> 00:02:41,844
So you would have the Galactica
jump into a Cylon's hornets' nest,

38
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:45,346
risk everything,
for one solitary, single child.

39
00:02:45,471 --> 00:02:49,318
- Is that what you're telling me?
- She's not just any child.

40
00:02:50,031 --> 00:02:51,531
With Caprica Six's miscarriage,

41
00:02:51,656 --> 00:02:53,656
Hera is our people's only hope

42
00:02:53,964 --> 00:02:56,218
of avoiding eventual extinction.

43
00:02:56,636 --> 00:02:58,551
She may be our only hope, too.

44
00:03:01,844 --> 00:03:02,944
I just ex...

45
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:09,002
We just experienced
something remarkable.

46
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,506
Hera wrote the notes to a song.

47
00:03:13,844 --> 00:03:17,158
A song that my father used to play to me
when I was a child.

48
00:03:17,283 --> 00:03:20,883
The same song that switched us on
when we were in that nebula.

49
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:24,231
The same song that led us to Earth.

50
00:03:25,843 --> 00:03:29,467
Something is happening here,
something greater than all of us,

51
00:03:29,592 --> 00:03:32,292
and that little girl
is in the middle of it.

52
00:03:32,656 --> 00:03:34,505
She's the key, sir.

53
00:03:36,468 --> 00:03:40,476
In other words, it's our destiny
to go after her, right?

54
00:03:43,968 --> 00:03:44,968
Wrong.

55
00:03:45,782 --> 00:03:49,562
I've had it up to here with destiny,
prophecy,

56
00:03:49,851 --> 00:03:51,814
with God or the Gods.

57
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:53,766
Look where it's left us.

58
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,130
The ass end of nowhere,

59
00:03:57,455 --> 00:03:59,705
nearly half of our people are gone,

60
00:04:00,468 --> 00:04:02,818
Earth, a worthless cinder,

61
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:05,595
and I can't even
walk down the halls of my ship

62
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,164
without wondering if I'm gonna catch
a bullet for getting us into this mess.

63
00:04:14,714 --> 00:04:16,029
We're alive, Bill.

64
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:19,203
Four years ago,
I wouldn't have taken odds on that.

65
00:04:19,657 --> 00:04:21,343
At least give us a recon bird.

66
00:04:21,842 --> 00:04:23,992
We can see what we're up against.

67
00:04:33,217 --> 00:04:34,867
Make it a heavy Raider.

68
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,319
I don't want Helo and Athena
to find out about this.

69
00:04:47,605 --> 00:04:48,782
Look at me.

70
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:55,029
Look at me.

71
00:04:57,967 --> 00:04:58,967
Look at me.

72
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,162
You hate me, don't you?

73
00:05:08,157 --> 00:05:09,157
Say it.

74
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,280
Say it.

75
00:05:21,026 --> 00:05:22,404
Gods frakkin' damn it.

76
00:05:25,622 --> 00:05:26,622
Hera?

77
00:05:27,282 --> 00:05:28,201
Hera!

78
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:31,913
Hera!

79
00:05:48,917 --> 00:05:51,417
Bill, I've been having
that dream again.

80
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,052
Help me!

81
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,180
Grab him!

82
00:06:37,326 --> 00:06:38,326
Get him!

83
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:45,797
Grab the door!

84
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:52,941
Lock it!

85
00:06:56,426 --> 00:06:57,426
Lock it!

86
00:07:11,122 --> 00:07:14,243
BATTLESTAR GALACTICA
Season 4 - Episode 18

Subtitles
-=( Lords of Kobol )=-

88
00:07:54,934 --> 00:07:57,774
Got internal bleeding, Doc.
Taking her to surgery.

89
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:01,711
- Right. I hope we don't lose power.
- What's the tally?

90
00:08:01,836 --> 00:08:04,900
61 dead or missing so far,
including 26 of theirs.

91
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:08,446
The Leobens are calling it
the proverbial straw.

92
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,447
Say we've got five more jumps, max.

93
00:08:11,196 --> 00:08:13,635
After that, there's a 90% chance
of tearing her in half.

94
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,450
I don't want to hear
that you are 90% sure of anything.

95
00:08:16,575 --> 00:08:20,135
You come back when you are 100% sure,
you got that?

96
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,167
- Go take care of your injuries.
- Yes, sir.

97
00:08:23,491 --> 00:08:25,697
That frakkin' Cylon rep, Sonja,

98
00:08:25,822 --> 00:08:28,841
wanted to know
when you'd be transferring your flag.

99
00:08:29,093 --> 00:08:32,822
Transferring to her baseship?
That'll be the frakkin' day.

100
00:08:32,947 --> 00:08:34,633
That's exactly what I said.

101
00:08:34,758 --> 00:08:36,932
I'll get on on top
of this repair detail,

102
00:08:37,057 --> 00:08:38,807
we'll straighten her out.

103
00:08:39,698 --> 00:08:43,732
Must be tough saying to good-bye
to both of your women at once.

104
00:08:48,822 --> 00:08:50,279
You must feel like

105
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:52,139
we're abandoning you.

106
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:54,275
No one's going anywhere.

107
00:08:55,444 --> 00:08:57,844
And neither one of my women
are dying.

108
00:08:59,735 --> 00:09:01,165
They just need a little

109
00:09:01,334 --> 00:09:03,167
more care and attention.

110
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:07,421
Hera.

111
00:09:14,238 --> 00:09:15,345
Admiral Adama

112
00:09:15,591 --> 00:09:18,549
will be forced to abandon Galactica.

113
00:09:18,674 --> 00:09:20,267
- Yes.
- At which point,

114
00:09:20,606 --> 00:09:24,673
the Cylon baseship
will be our sole means of defense.

115
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:29,111
Under the Admiral's command,
augmented by Galactica's pilots,

116
00:09:29,378 --> 00:09:32,386
planes, and military personnel
as it has always been.

117
00:09:32,511 --> 00:09:33,864
Mr. Adama,

118
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:36,860
but it sure seems like
we're putting a lot of power

119
00:09:36,985 --> 00:09:40,610
into the hands of some people...
And I use the term loosely...

120
00:09:40,735 --> 00:09:43,459
Who not so long ago were doing
their damndest to wipe us out!

121
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:46,050
- And your concerns are noted.
- As you all know...

122
00:09:46,175 --> 00:09:47,325
Let me speak!

123
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:52,674
As you all know, we agreed to accept
Admiral Adama's military authority

124
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:55,149
in return for a seat
on this council.

125
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:59,587
- We intend to abide by that promise.
- Speaking of promises,

126
00:09:59,712 --> 00:10:04,051
I have been complaining about air
quality aboard Hitei Kan from day one.

127
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:08,048
I am submitting my requisition now

128
00:10:08,173 --> 00:10:11,068
for Galactica's CO²
and particulate scrubbers.

129
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,925
- Excuse me?
- As long as we get the FTLs.

130
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:18,507
Our last emergency jump,
it took us six minutes to spin up!

131
00:10:18,632 --> 00:10:20,513
- Wait a minute.
- Obviously we will have to do

132
00:10:20,638 --> 00:10:23,960
a complete inventory
of Galactica's equipment.

133
00:10:24,085 --> 00:10:27,334
Maybe even a lottery
in order to ensure

134
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:30,254
an equitable distribution
of all the equipment.

135
00:10:31,387 --> 00:10:34,207
Now listen to me
for one Gods damn minute!

136
00:10:34,493 --> 00:10:37,842
No one removes so much as one bolt

137
00:10:37,967 --> 00:10:39,099
from this Battlestar,

138
00:10:39,224 --> 00:10:42,516
not until the Admiral
tells us we can.

139
00:10:42,641 --> 00:10:43,641
Really!

140
00:10:44,808 --> 00:10:47,145
What does Gaius Baltar
say about that?

141
00:10:48,142 --> 00:10:49,554
Gaius Baltar?

142
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:53,583
<i>Angels.</i>

143
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,564
<i>Angels, I hear you say?</i>

144
00:10:57,311 --> 00:10:59,109
<i>I don't believe
that angels appear to you</i>

145
00:10:59,234 --> 00:11:02,220
<i>in some mystical, spectral form.</i>

146
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,289
<i>Angels take the guise</i>

147
00:11:06,135 --> 00:11:09,129
<i>of those who are nearest
and dearest to you,</i>

148
00:11:09,254 --> 00:11:11,462
<i>those who can understand your doubts</i>

149
00:11:12,286 --> 00:11:13,647
<i>and your trials,</i>

150
00:11:15,357 --> 00:11:18,006
<i>and steer you back
on the road to salvation.</i>

151
00:11:20,537 --> 00:11:22,347
<i>I believe in these angels</i>

152
00:11:23,633 --> 00:11:25,058
because I see them.

153
00:11:31,668 --> 00:11:33,546
Wherever you are in the fleet,

154
00:11:34,396 --> 00:11:37,279
this is Gaius Baltar
wishing you a beautiful day.

155
00:11:45,658 --> 00:11:48,707
Excuse me.
Caprica? Caprica Six!

156
00:11:52,898 --> 00:11:54,583
It's...
It's good to...

157
00:11:57,332 --> 00:11:59,051
Listen, I heard about...

158
00:11:59,746 --> 00:12:00,879
your loss,

159
00:12:01,004 --> 00:12:02,869
and I want to offer you
my condolences,

160
00:12:02,994 --> 00:12:06,213
- tell you how truly sorry I am.
- Thank you, Gaius.

161
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,209
I see...
I see you've got your...

162
00:12:12,457 --> 00:12:15,082
- If you need any more, we have got...
- I'm fine.

163
00:12:15,355 --> 00:12:16,443
I'm also not

164
00:12:18,096 --> 00:12:21,437
unaware of your current situation.
If you need a place to stay...

165
00:12:21,562 --> 00:12:24,768
- I have no desire to join your harem.
- No, No.

166
00:12:28,362 --> 00:12:29,903
That's not what I...

167
00:12:30,665 --> 00:12:32,173
That's not what...

168
00:12:34,207 --> 00:12:37,839
We are trying to make a difference
within the fleet.

169
00:12:38,082 --> 00:12:41,343
You haven't changed,
Gaius, not really.

170
00:12:43,581 --> 00:12:44,581
I have.

171
00:13:06,767 --> 00:13:08,953
- She wants to talk to you.
- Me?

172
00:13:09,123 --> 00:13:10,256
She's dying.

173
00:13:10,808 --> 00:13:14,018
Could you just take a few minutes
out of your busy schedule

174
00:13:14,143 --> 00:13:15,580
and be with her.

175
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,270
Thank you.

176
00:13:25,391 --> 00:13:27,222
Thank me for what?

177
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:29,850
For the privilege

178
00:13:30,588 --> 00:13:34,229
of finally being able to meet
my father before I die.

179
00:13:37,581 --> 00:13:39,509
You shouldn't be thanking me.

180
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:44,161
I spent most of my life
trying to kill your kind.

181
00:13:48,626 --> 00:13:50,567
Too much confusion.

182
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,809
I want my mommy.

183
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,700
I want my mommy.

184
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,716
I want my mommy.
Take me home.

185
00:14:18,143 --> 00:14:20,288
It's too bad they never upgraded
the FTL on this relic,

186
00:14:20,413 --> 00:14:22,461
but if you think I'm gonna
put up with your sniveling

187
00:14:22,586 --> 00:14:25,291
and your whining for another
dozen jumps, guess again!

188
00:14:26,393 --> 00:14:28,914
I want my mommy!
Take me home!

189
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:30,208
Fine!

190
00:14:33,383 --> 00:14:35,593
Let's see if you can cry
in your sleep.

191
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,625
It might be a long snooze, too,
because these

192
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:42,339
don't come in kiddy doses.

193
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,466
Give me your arm!

194
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,170
You okay?

195
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,880
Saul, it's Hera.
We're got to do more.

196
00:15:10,005 --> 00:15:12,270
I got him to send out
a recon mission.

197
00:15:12,395 --> 00:15:13,956
Yeah, a recon mission.

198
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:17,706
Our people's future is at stake and
you got him to send out a recon mission.

199
00:15:17,902 --> 00:15:18,958
"Our people".

200
00:15:19,128 --> 00:15:21,203
That's right, Saul.

201
00:15:21,472 --> 00:15:24,047
Thank Gods. Oh, frak.

202
00:15:25,957 --> 00:15:27,017
Empty!

203
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:33,109
You want to know who my people are,
lady? The ones on this ship.

204
00:15:33,398 --> 00:15:35,401
The ones I fought with
and bled with.

205
00:15:35,526 --> 00:15:38,382
The Old Man, this crew,
they're my family.

206
00:15:38,956 --> 00:15:41,990
The only family I've known,
and the only one I care to.

207
00:15:48,331 --> 00:15:49,569
You're a pip.

208
00:15:50,394 --> 00:15:51,744
You really are.

209
00:15:52,805 --> 00:15:54,040
"Old man".

210
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:58,215
Old compared to who?

211
00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:01,918
You were my husband 2,000 years

212
00:16:02,043 --> 00:16:04,045
before you even met Bill Adama.

213
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:06,520
2,000 years, that's a number.

214
00:16:06,645 --> 00:16:09,099
That's what it means to me.
It's nothing.

215
00:16:09,722 --> 00:16:12,560
But that man's friendship...
Oh, frak!

216
00:16:14,957 --> 00:16:17,137
- You're a Cylon, Saul.
- Yeah.

217
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:20,185
Whether you remember
that life or not,

218
00:16:21,546 --> 00:16:25,400
at least you must understand
what we were trying to do.

219
00:16:26,207 --> 00:16:29,011
We wanted to end the cycle of war

220
00:16:29,136 --> 00:16:31,580
between man and machine.

221
00:16:31,705 --> 00:16:32,741
That was a bust.

222
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:34,946
Yes, we failed,

223
00:16:35,777 --> 00:16:37,960
but we have a second chance now.

224
00:16:38,641 --> 00:16:39,641
Hera.

225
00:16:40,593 --> 00:16:42,042
Without her,

226
00:16:42,323 --> 00:16:45,754
our children are going
to die off one by one,

227
00:16:46,044 --> 00:16:49,519
just like they're dying
right now in Cottle's sickbay.

228
00:16:49,644 --> 00:16:50,882
I had a child.

229
00:16:51,865 --> 00:16:52,865
He died.

230
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,148
You're wrong, Saul.

231
00:17:01,017 --> 00:17:03,108
You had millions.

232
00:17:25,706 --> 00:17:28,505
Come on, you've got to be hungry.
Eat this.

233
00:17:42,581 --> 00:17:45,631
Do you know what I do sometimes
when I'm sad?

234
00:17:49,554 --> 00:17:52,073
I go to this special place.

235
00:17:55,213 --> 00:17:57,653
A house where I wanted to live

236
00:17:59,031 --> 00:18:01,329
with a man that I loved.

237
00:18:18,627 --> 00:18:20,167
You can see this?

238
00:18:22,428 --> 00:18:23,935
You can project?

239
00:18:27,266 --> 00:18:29,385
Yeah, you can still eat it.

240
00:18:37,946 --> 00:18:39,228
Missed a spot.

241
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:43,599
By your left sideburn.

242
00:18:44,975 --> 00:18:46,558
The latch was busted.

243
00:18:52,504 --> 00:18:53,506
Thank you.

244
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:55,774
So...

245
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:00,807
Do you really believe all that bilge

246
00:19:01,324 --> 00:19:03,811
you were spewing on the wireless?

247
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:07,255
- Bilge?
- Angels.

248
00:19:09,223 --> 00:19:11,176
The angels walking among us.

249
00:19:12,432 --> 00:19:15,728
The angels that bring out
our better nature, bla bla bla...

250
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,138
I do, as a matter of fact.

251
00:19:19,263 --> 00:19:21,900
And you've seen
these angels for yourself?

252
00:19:23,277 --> 00:19:25,153
With alarming regularity.

253
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:27,838
Regularity.

254
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,606
That must be important
when you're full of crap.

255
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:33,046
That's charming.

256
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,368
Absolutely charming.

257
00:19:35,493 --> 00:19:37,926
And you are entitled
to your opinion obviously.

258
00:19:38,726 --> 00:19:40,428
Who are you, by the way again?

259
00:19:41,149 --> 00:19:42,168
Me?

260
00:19:44,002 --> 00:19:45,726
I'm a dead chick, that's who.

261
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,758
All right, and I'm full of crap.

262
00:19:49,728 --> 00:19:51,667
No, I mean it. I'm dead,

263
00:19:52,173 --> 00:19:53,781
as in six feet under dead.

264
00:19:53,906 --> 00:19:57,019
Dead, as in crash-landed,
burned to a crisp dead.

265
00:20:01,544 --> 00:20:02,552
Here.

266
00:20:05,697 --> 00:20:07,596
I took these off my body,

267
00:20:07,721 --> 00:20:10,290
what was left of it,
anyway, on Earth.

268
00:20:10,982 --> 00:20:12,001
Take 'em.

269
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,661
You used to be a scientist.

270
00:20:14,786 --> 00:20:17,381
Run some tests.
Pull out the ol' Cylon detector,

271
00:20:17,555 --> 00:20:20,218
do whatever you need to do,
because I have no idea.

272
00:20:20,343 --> 00:20:21,970
The only thing I know for sure...

273
00:20:22,516 --> 00:20:23,881
I'm not an angel.

274
00:20:59,436 --> 00:21:02,100
We tried hooking him up
to the main power grid.

275
00:21:02,225 --> 00:21:04,970
Thought it might help him
reset his neural net.

276
00:21:06,303 --> 00:21:09,142
So in other words,
you tried to jumpstart him like a car.

277
00:21:11,028 --> 00:21:13,940
Let me guess.
It didn't work so well for you.

278
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:17,332
- Take a break.
- Someone has to monitor...

279
00:21:17,457 --> 00:21:21,269
I'd like a minute alone with my husband.
I'm sure you don't mind.

280
00:21:51,656 --> 00:21:53,770
It's funny, you know? I...

281
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:01,878
I remember when

282
00:22:03,347 --> 00:22:04,666
I told you that if

283
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,700
I found out you were a Cylon,
I would

284
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,631
put a bullet in your head.

285
00:22:10,612 --> 00:22:13,126
Some frakker beats me to it,
all I can think about is

286
00:22:13,251 --> 00:22:15,056
how I can get you back.

287
00:22:16,276 --> 00:22:18,908
Human, Cylon,
it doesn't seem to matter.

288
00:22:19,895 --> 00:22:21,734
I just wanted you back...

289
00:22:25,418 --> 00:22:27,392
Because you're just Sam.

290
00:22:33,211 --> 00:22:34,640
You are my Sam.

291
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:48,533
And that's how I'm gonna
remember you...

292
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:52,161
The neuroanatomy of fear and faith
share common afferent pathways.

293
00:22:58,878 --> 00:22:59,869
Flip a coin.

294
00:22:59,994 --> 00:23:02,171
Increased vascular pressure
marks the threat response.

295
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:11,112
Free will scuttles in the swamp of fear.
Do not fear the word.

296
00:23:11,237 --> 00:23:13,765
You are the harbinger of death.
You will lead them all to their end.

297
00:23:14,003 --> 00:23:15,094
End of line.

298
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,186
New command. Resume function...

299
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:30,533
"And so I walked,
like the beat cop I used to be.

300
00:23:30,658 --> 00:23:33,424
"When you walk,
you see things in different ways.

301
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:36,482
"But when something's out of place,
you notice.

302
00:23:37,297 --> 00:23:39,168
"A cop's eyes always notice,

303
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:40,513
"and those eyes

304
00:23:40,638 --> 00:23:43,708
"were one thing
they couldn't take away from me."

305
00:23:46,436 --> 00:23:47,447
What?

306
00:23:48,984 --> 00:23:50,447
Open to page 61.

307
00:24:01,335 --> 00:24:02,440
Don't worry.

308
00:24:04,793 --> 00:24:07,153
Cottle won't mind. It's medicinal.

309
00:24:09,269 --> 00:24:11,339
I can't believe you saved this.

310
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:21,223
Do you remember that day?

311
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:24,378
Yes.

312
00:24:24,637 --> 00:24:25,722
New Caprica.

313
00:24:27,094 --> 00:24:30,134
Baltar's ground-breaking.
We talked and talked.

314
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,678
About a lot of things.

315
00:24:34,949 --> 00:24:37,308
Guess what I'm thinking
about right now?

316
00:24:40,316 --> 00:24:41,574
Give me a hint.

317
00:24:41,699 --> 00:24:42,719
Mountains.

318
00:24:44,025 --> 00:24:46,518
A stream running into a little lake.

319
00:24:47,561 --> 00:24:50,113
Water so clear
it's like looking through glass.

320
00:24:51,248 --> 00:24:52,360
Your cabin.

321
00:24:53,629 --> 00:24:55,409
The one you wanted to build.

322
00:25:00,486 --> 00:25:03,476
It's amazing how much
I still think about it.

323
00:25:10,437 --> 00:25:12,445
You know, sometimes I wonder

324
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:16,780
what home is.

325
00:25:19,755 --> 00:25:21,380
Is it an actual place,

326
00:25:22,148 --> 00:25:25,036
or is it some kind
of longing for something,

327
00:25:25,161 --> 00:25:26,816
some kind of connection.

328
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:30,018
You know,
I spent my whole life on Caprica.

329
00:25:30,861 --> 00:25:33,339
I was born in one house,
and then I...

330
00:25:33,852 --> 00:25:35,417
I moved to another.

331
00:25:37,204 --> 00:25:38,255
And then...

332
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:41,146
This.

333
00:25:44,291 --> 00:25:45,553
And then now,

334
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,754
I don't think I've...

335
00:25:49,968 --> 00:25:52,648
ever felt truly at home until

336
00:25:54,182 --> 00:25:55,595
these last few months

337
00:25:57,383 --> 00:25:58,655
here with you.

338
00:26:04,649 --> 00:26:06,579
I know you love this ship.

339
00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:10,651
You probably love her more
than you love me.

340
00:26:15,577 --> 00:26:17,077
Bill, if you don't

341
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,009
get us off this ship,

342
00:26:19,134 --> 00:26:22,073
you may lose both of us
at the same time.

343
00:26:25,054 --> 00:26:27,184
Why don't you give us a chance?

344
00:27:05,611 --> 00:27:08,502
A closed system lacks
the ability to renew itself.

345
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,448
Knowledge alone is a poor primer.

346
00:27:10,573 --> 00:27:12,310
This has been happening all
over the ship.

347
00:27:12,435 --> 00:27:14,333
Power surges,
temperature fluctuations,

348
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:16,676
and now you're telling me
it's been him all along?

349
00:27:17,059 --> 00:27:19,034
We had no idea he had this ability.

350
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:20,622
How's he hooking into the ship?

351
00:27:20,747 --> 00:27:22,975
I thought all our systems
were firewalled.

352
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,695
Well, they are, which is why
he hasn't accessed your computers.

353
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,600
But the organic resins
we've been injecting

354
00:27:27,725 --> 00:27:29,805
into your super structure
contain inductive elements,

355
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:31,454
not unlike nerve fibers.

356
00:27:31,579 --> 00:27:33,974
So he must have linked to those
and then through them,

357
00:27:34,099 --> 00:27:36,320
the electrical circuitry
embedded in Galactica's bulkheads.

358
00:27:36,852 --> 00:27:40,068
What about our FTLs,
now that we've upgraded with your tech?

359
00:27:40,193 --> 00:27:41,575
Are they vulnerable?

360
00:27:44,103 --> 00:27:45,704
- Theoretically.
- So, theoretically,

361
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:49,333
he could jump the ship
if he wanted to just like yours did.

362
00:27:49,948 --> 00:27:52,086
End of line. Begin reintegration...

363
00:27:53,057 --> 00:27:54,463
Great. That's all we need.

364
00:27:55,171 --> 00:27:56,382
Take him off line.

365
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,301
Do it.

366
00:27:58,469 --> 00:28:00,468
Begin reintegration
of command subroutines.

367
00:28:00,889 --> 00:28:04,018
There's a hole in the bucket, dear Liza,
dear Liza. There's a hole in the bucket.

368
00:28:04,143 --> 00:28:06,472
The long view returns
patterns and repetitions.

369
00:28:06,597 --> 00:28:08,811
All has happened before
and will happen again...

370
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,420
That's a blessed relief.

371
00:28:16,182 --> 00:28:18,447
- Cavil moved the Colony.
- When?

372
00:28:18,941 --> 00:28:20,740
Judging from the residual
energy readings,

373
00:28:21,245 --> 00:28:22,616
about five months ago.

374
00:28:23,447 --> 00:28:25,110
Just before the civil war.

375
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,378
And you have no idea
where he moved it to?

376
00:28:31,137 --> 00:28:31,998
No.

377
00:28:35,983 --> 00:28:37,064
Then excuse me.

378
00:28:38,296 --> 00:28:41,802
Anything you imagine in here
can be as real as you want it to be.

379
00:28:45,671 --> 00:28:47,871
Do you want to see a special room,

380
00:28:49,502 --> 00:28:52,046
a room where I thought
my daughter would live?

381
00:29:30,219 --> 00:29:31,059
Sir.

382
00:29:32,059 --> 00:29:33,773
Can I walk with you, sir?

383
00:29:35,818 --> 00:29:37,505
I'm going to the funeral.

384
00:29:38,014 --> 00:29:39,978
I understand if you're not going.

385
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:43,541
I'd like your permission, sir,

386
00:29:44,327 --> 00:29:47,175
to take out a Raptor
to go and look for my daughter.

387
00:29:47,666 --> 00:29:50,130
I'm sure Athena
would be willing to pilot and...

388
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:52,706
I've already sent out
a recon mission

389
00:29:52,951 --> 00:29:54,407
and they reported back.

390
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:57,420
- You did?
- We were looking for a facility

391
00:29:57,755 --> 00:30:00,381
where we knew
Boomer would probably take Hera,

392
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:02,042
but it was no longer there.

393
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:03,998
Sir,

394
00:30:05,516 --> 00:30:07,534
let me take out that Raptor.

395
00:30:07,855 --> 00:30:10,257
- Maybe I can find something.
- She's gone.

396
00:30:12,007 --> 00:30:13,435
I've lost a son,

397
00:30:14,516 --> 00:30:16,366
and you've lost a daughter.

398
00:30:18,507 --> 00:30:20,846
But I can't condone
a suicide mission.

399
00:30:22,644 --> 00:30:23,794
So let it go.

400
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:29,721
You want me to let it go?

401
00:30:30,766 --> 00:30:32,623
You're the one who can't let go.

402
00:30:33,042 --> 00:30:35,605
Painting over the holes in this bucket?
This ship is dead!

403
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,710
But my daughter
might still be alive.

404
00:30:38,364 --> 00:30:40,587
I understand your pain, Captain,

405
00:30:42,078 --> 00:30:43,659
but don't lecture me.

406
00:30:46,382 --> 00:30:49,150
You're here to take orders.
Do you understand?

407
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,283
I'm sorry.

408
00:30:54,676 --> 00:30:56,328
I'm... I'm sorry.

409
00:30:59,676 --> 00:31:02,159
One... one Raptor, Admiral.

410
00:31:02,605 --> 00:31:04,801
Maybe it is a suicide mission,
but...

411
00:31:06,257 --> 00:31:08,073
at least give me the chance
to do something.

412
00:31:09,132 --> 00:31:10,132
Please?

413
00:31:19,241 --> 00:31:21,759
For those
that we have lost in the past,

414
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:25,134
and for those
that we are burying today.

415
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:27,652
- They gave their lives...
- We must remember...

416
00:31:27,777 --> 00:31:30,518
- to save this ship.
- there is a higher purpose.

417
00:31:30,643 --> 00:31:33,893
Casualties,
as much as any soldier fallen...

418
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:36,634
... we mourn
the passing of our friends.

419
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:38,839
- Heavenly father...
- We must understand...

420
00:31:38,964 --> 00:31:41,482
- grant us the strength...
- that what we sacrifice today...

421
00:31:41,607 --> 00:31:43,232
- the wisdom...
- our women and men...

422
00:31:43,357 --> 00:31:46,578
- above all, a measure of acceptance...
- of extreme courage.

423
00:31:46,703 --> 00:31:49,284
- however small.
- Because that is what we are,

424
00:31:49,569 --> 00:31:52,355
voyagers traversing the stars

425
00:31:52,882 --> 00:31:55,713
in search of grace.

426
00:31:56,123 --> 00:32:00,121
- So say we all!
- So say we all!

427
00:32:11,952 --> 00:32:14,051
Present arms!

428
00:32:28,915 --> 00:32:30,076
Dismissed.

429
00:32:33,352 --> 00:32:34,326
Listen to me.

430
00:32:34,888 --> 00:32:36,512
The death is not the end.

431
00:32:38,727 --> 00:32:41,674
And I'm not talking
about Cylon resurrection,

432
00:32:42,911 --> 00:32:44,822
I'm talking about the gift

433
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:46,965
of eternal life

434
00:32:47,384 --> 00:32:50,446
that is offered
to each and every one of us.

435
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:52,830
Yes,

436
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:55,723
even the most flawed amongst us.

437
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,928
All we need is the courage

438
00:33:02,821 --> 00:33:04,277
to face death

439
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,775
when it comes calling for us,
embrace it even.

440
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,616
Only then

441
00:33:09,589 --> 00:33:11,545
will we truly have the ability

442
00:33:11,821 --> 00:33:14,098
to cross over,

443
00:33:15,196 --> 00:33:17,453
as one amongst us here has already

444
00:33:17,777 --> 00:33:19,482
crossed over.

445
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,107
One amongst us here

446
00:33:24,652 --> 00:33:27,893
is living proof that there is life

447
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:29,475
after death.

448
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:32,928
The blood

449
00:33:33,554 --> 00:33:35,045
on these dog tags

450
00:33:36,205 --> 00:33:39,187
comes from necrotic flesh.

451
00:33:39,312 --> 00:33:40,857
That means a dead body.

452
00:33:41,973 --> 00:33:43,312
The DNA analysis

453
00:33:43,705 --> 00:33:46,079
is 100% proof positive match

454
00:33:46,508 --> 00:33:49,606
for one Captain Kara Thrace.

455
00:33:51,209 --> 00:33:54,323
I told you there were angels
walking amongst you.

456
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,378
When will you believe me?

457
00:33:57,021 --> 00:33:59,209
She took these
from her own mortal remains

458
00:34:01,048 --> 00:34:02,081
that lie on Earth.

459
00:34:02,325 --> 00:34:04,958
- Even now, interred with her bones...
- That's enough!

460
00:34:05,873 --> 00:34:08,629
- Ask her yourself!
- I will put you in the brig!

461
00:34:08,798 --> 00:34:11,846
She's not a Cylon!
They've already been revealed to us!

462
00:34:11,971 --> 00:34:14,822
Ask her yourself!
She will not deny it!

463
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:24,668
Dismissed, everyone!
Off the deck now!

464
00:34:41,908 --> 00:34:42,908
Kara?

465
00:34:43,908 --> 00:34:45,301
What are you doing?

466
00:34:52,222 --> 00:34:53,562
Okay, listen to me.

467
00:34:56,258 --> 00:34:58,429
I don't care, all right.
I don't...

468
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:01,892
We've all been through
some crazy, crazy stuff.

469
00:35:02,553 --> 00:35:04,268
I don't care what you think you saw.

470
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:07,008
I watched your Viper explode.

471
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,633
Don't care.

472
00:35:09,767 --> 00:35:11,553
I'm here. You're here.

473
00:35:18,749 --> 00:35:20,356
This is all that matters.

474
00:35:27,526 --> 00:35:28,401
Okay.

475
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:31,651
See you around...

476
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,178
Kara Thrace.

477
00:36:49,329 --> 00:36:51,990
- Everything went smoothly, I take it?
- Yes.

478
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:55,307
It's a shame I can't be there
to see the expression on Ellen's face

479
00:36:55,432 --> 00:36:57,798
when she realizes how we played her.

480
00:36:58,336 --> 00:37:00,364
You had a hard day's work.
Go get some rest.

481
00:37:00,489 --> 00:37:02,093
We'll take it from here.

482
00:37:03,812 --> 00:37:06,014
Don't worry.
We'll take good care of her.

483
00:37:24,975 --> 00:37:26,751
Boomer, no, Boomer!

484
00:37:27,701 --> 00:37:28,662
There, there.

485
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:31,421
You'll have all sorts
of new playmates pretty soon.

486
00:39:26,898 --> 00:39:29,018
I know you can hear me, Sam,

487
00:39:29,855 --> 00:39:32,389
just like I know on some level
you'll understand.

488
00:39:34,394 --> 00:39:36,537
The old me is dead and gone,

489
00:39:37,285 --> 00:39:38,881
same as the old you.

490
00:39:40,075 --> 00:39:42,062
Just took me a while to accept it.

491
00:39:43,747 --> 00:39:46,281
Which brings us
to the larger question:

492
00:39:47,754 --> 00:39:49,194
why am I here?

493
00:39:50,086 --> 00:39:52,556
I think it has something to do
with this music,

494
00:39:54,919 --> 00:39:57,944
there's a pattern there,
a pattern that I...

495
00:39:58,635 --> 00:39:59,986
can't see,

496
00:40:01,794 --> 00:40:03,792
but I think that you can.

497
00:40:05,131 --> 00:40:07,112
So we are going to sit in this room

498
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,836
until we figure it out.

499
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,306
Talk to me, Sam.

500
00:40:22,796 --> 00:40:23,896
New command.

501
00:40:39,418 --> 00:40:40,968
You wanted to see me?

502
00:40:44,198 --> 00:40:45,948
I've made some decisions.

503
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,230
Good.

504
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:50,230
About time you sent
those toaster work crews packing,

505
00:40:50,355 --> 00:40:52,020
for all the good they've done.

506
00:40:52,145 --> 00:40:53,149
Actually,

507
00:40:53,943 --> 00:40:56,328
I'm stopping
all the repairs on the ship.

508
00:41:06,065 --> 00:41:09,664
Put out the orders I want the crew
to start stripping down Galactica,

509
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:12,850
packing all the weapons and gear.

510
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:23,473
Gonna start offloading the civilians
by tomorrow.

511
00:41:24,401 --> 00:41:26,733
Full crews and ordinances transferred

512
00:41:27,214 --> 00:41:29,223
- by the end of the week.
- What?

513
00:41:32,812 --> 00:41:34,991
We're abandoning ship, Tigh.

514
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:37,750
No.

515
00:41:38,232 --> 00:41:39,758
No, you can't do this.

516
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,401
I have to, Saul.

517
00:41:44,508 --> 00:41:45,678
She's dying,

518
00:41:46,473 --> 00:41:47,838
and we both know it.

519
00:41:48,169 --> 00:41:51,580
As your XO, I can't let you do this.
I won't.

520
00:41:55,196 --> 00:41:57,134
You've never let me down, Saul.

521
00:41:58,151 --> 00:41:59,794
I can't blame you for...

522
00:42:00,723 --> 00:42:02,241
being what you are,

523
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:04,354
especially since

524
00:42:05,116 --> 00:42:09,116
it includes being the finest officer
and friend I've ever had.

525
00:42:10,473 --> 00:42:12,028
This ship never let us down,

526
00:42:13,312 --> 00:42:15,571
so we're gonna send her off
in style.

527
00:42:28,433 --> 00:42:30,165
So we're gonna do this?

528
00:42:33,879 --> 00:42:35,745
She was a grand old lady.

529
00:42:36,593 --> 00:42:37,743
