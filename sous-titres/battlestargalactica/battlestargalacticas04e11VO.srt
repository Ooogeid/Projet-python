1
00:00:20,347 --> 00:00:23,192
<i>Previously on</i>
Battlestar Galactica...

2
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:27,651
I don't know
what to make of you and me.

3
00:00:27,948 --> 00:00:29,195
I'm having trouble

4
00:00:29,588 --> 00:00:32,384
- accepting this.
- We have to push forward.

5
00:00:33,134 --> 00:00:34,863
Keep the fleet together.

6
00:00:35,498 --> 00:00:36,494
Find Earth.

7
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,896
3,600 years ago,

8
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:43,626
Pythia wrote about the exile
and the rebirth of the human race.

9
00:00:44,596 --> 00:00:46,172
And the Lords anointed a leader

10
00:00:46,297 --> 00:00:49,548
to guide the caravan of the heavens
to their new homeland.

11
00:00:50,212 --> 00:00:52,885
I came back with D'Anna
to be with my people.

12
00:00:53,271 --> 00:00:54,804
Because you're one of the Five.

13
00:00:55,241 --> 00:00:57,084
You're one of the Final Five.

14
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:01,094
Turns out there's another kind of Cylon
we didn't know about,

15
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:03,145
- and I'm one of them.
- Corporal!

16
00:01:03,746 --> 00:01:05,269
Get it out of my sight!

17
00:01:06,046 --> 00:01:09,193
Put your hands on your heads
and face the Viper. Do it now!

18
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:11,779
- What the hell is going on?
- They're Cylons.

19
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,265
There's something different
about this Viper. Something's changed.

20
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:17,535
You gotta find it.

21
00:01:25,629 --> 00:01:28,003
That's a colonial
emergency locator signal.

22
00:01:28,302 --> 00:01:30,339
So you're all in agreement
this is the way to Earth?

23
00:01:30,755 --> 00:01:33,590
It's a stretch,
but it's the best explanation we've got.

24
00:01:33,715 --> 00:01:36,654
So the question is,
where do we go from here?

25
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,014
We go to Earth together.

26
00:01:52,271 --> 00:01:53,272
Earth.

27
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,619
-=( Lords of Kobol )=-

28
00:03:13,948 --> 00:03:14,954
Admiral.

29
00:03:22,763 --> 00:03:25,534
Our scouts say the same
all over the planet.

30
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:29,114
No answers to our hails.
No signs of human life.

31
00:03:30,732 --> 00:03:33,198
It's the same report
we got from ours.

32
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:42,226
This signal's pretty weak.

33
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,145
The emergency locator battery
must be running low on juice.

34
00:03:47,374 --> 00:03:49,420
It was probably on for a long time.

35
00:03:58,713 --> 00:04:00,251
Low level radiation.

36
00:04:01,184 --> 00:04:02,945
Definitely in the water
and the food chain.

37
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,896
Put word out not to eat or drink
anything down here.

38
00:04:09,228 --> 00:04:12,459
Baltar just confirmed it. The planet
was nuked about 2,000 years ago.

39
00:04:13,779 --> 00:04:17,777
It squares with what our teams
have been finding all over the planet.

40
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:19,671
It's perfect.

41
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:23,720
We traded one nuked civilization
for another.

42
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,430
Let's get out of here.

43
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,058
Just don't give up.

44
00:05:10,566 --> 00:05:12,956
Just don't give up.
Don't fall apart.

45
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,536
Easy, Dee.

46
00:05:16,552 --> 00:05:17,759
Take it easy.

47
00:06:13,714 --> 00:06:14,914
Get me out of here.

48
00:06:19,211 --> 00:06:20,489
Madam President!

49
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:22,866
Is Earth really a wasteland?

50
00:06:26,922 --> 00:06:28,702
Is there anything at all?

51
00:06:34,626 --> 00:06:37,257
The president will be making
a statement in due course.

52
00:06:37,382 --> 00:06:40,683
You will find out everything
in good time.

53
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,894
It's colonial.

54
00:07:02,572 --> 00:07:06,284
It's standard on all aircraft.
Part of our inertial nav system.

55
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,305
"757-NC."

56
00:07:25,037 --> 00:07:26,423
Kara, what is it?

57
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:28,666
What does it mean?

58
00:07:36,446 --> 00:07:39,327
The number on my ship is 8757-NC.

59
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:50,621
- I'm gonna get her!
- Hello!

60
00:07:54,943 --> 00:07:56,189
No, stop!

61
00:07:57,752 --> 00:07:59,652
I'm gonna go into the table!

62
00:08:04,757 --> 00:08:06,079
Raptor's down!

63
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:08,027
Appreciate it, Dee.

64
00:08:09,015 --> 00:08:10,376
You kidding?

65
00:08:10,915 --> 00:08:12,740
I look forward to this.

66
00:08:12,908 --> 00:08:14,784
I look forward to this.

67
00:08:19,885 --> 00:08:22,885
We'll be back soon, okay?
Thanks, Dee. Bye, baby!

68
00:08:27,593 --> 00:08:30,186
You have no idea
what's happened, do you?

69
00:08:32,207 --> 00:08:34,330
Today is just another day.

70
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,717
Hey, over here!

71
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:49,867
What is it?

72
00:09:07,044 --> 00:09:09,308
We found a couple of these
scattered among the bones

73
00:09:09,433 --> 00:09:11,048
in sites around the planet.

74
00:09:11,216 --> 00:09:12,295
Centurions.

75
00:09:13,324 --> 00:09:15,705
Similar,
but they're not one of ours.

76
00:09:16,545 --> 00:09:18,132
We've never seen this design.

77
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:22,059
So the Thirteenth Tribe settled here
and created their own Cylons.

78
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:25,480
And then the machines rose up
and killed their masters.

79
00:09:27,437 --> 00:09:30,067
That's what we thought.
Until we tested the bones.

80
00:09:30,433 --> 00:09:32,273
250 skeletons so far.

81
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:35,042
From four different sites
on the planet.

82
00:09:35,167 --> 00:09:37,908
- Using our protocols...
- The results are conclusive.

83
00:09:38,226 --> 00:09:40,638
- What's your point?
- They're not human.

84
00:09:42,269 --> 00:09:43,367
They're Cylon.

85
00:09:45,957 --> 00:09:47,045
All of 'em?

86
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:48,544
All of them.

87
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:58,082
The Thirteenth Tribe was Cylon.

88
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:07,748
The Thirteenth Tribe,
the tribe of Cylons,

89
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:10,393
came to this planet
and called it Earth.

90
00:10:17,188 --> 00:10:19,956
Madam President,
what do we do about the Quorum?

91
00:10:23,818 --> 00:10:27,082
You need to talk to them.
We need to tell them something.

92
00:10:30,587 --> 00:10:32,371
It should come from their president.

93
00:10:36,378 --> 00:10:37,615
Carry the ball.

94
00:10:41,896 --> 00:10:43,705
Bill, we need to talk.

95
00:10:46,328 --> 00:10:49,063
There's a lot of things
I gotta explain.

96
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:22,848
If my Viper's splattered all over
this planet, then who flew it here?

97
00:12:22,973 --> 00:12:25,584
And what the hell
did I fly back to Galactica?

98
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:27,487
Maybe it's better off not knowing.

99
00:12:27,972 --> 00:12:31,158
You're always telling me to face
the truth and not run from it.

100
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:33,218
Why the sudden change of heart?

101
00:12:35,802 --> 00:12:37,241
I've got a feeling...

102
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,680
- You might not like what you find.
- For me or you?

103
00:12:51,173 --> 00:12:52,477
There you are.

104
00:12:52,693 --> 00:12:54,717
The Raptor's ready to take you
back to Colonial One.

105
00:12:54,842 --> 00:12:56,587
What are you doing in here?

106
00:12:57,792 --> 00:12:59,234
I was just thinking.

107
00:13:01,068 --> 00:13:03,604
About all the pilots
who sat in those seats.

108
00:13:04,897 --> 00:13:07,217
Gave their lives for a dream

109
00:13:07,681 --> 00:13:09,830
of a new beginning on Earth.

110
00:13:12,411 --> 00:13:15,000
I don't want their sacrifice
to be meaningless.

111
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,857
You've got that look again.

112
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:18,910
What look?

113
00:13:20,473 --> 00:13:24,222
The one you had when your father
took Galactica back to New Caprica.

114
00:13:24,427 --> 00:13:27,107
We stayed behind on Pegasus
with the civilian fleet.

115
00:13:27,232 --> 00:13:28,849
You thought
you'd never see him again.

116
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,429
That easy to read, huh?

117
00:13:31,196 --> 00:13:32,222
Just to me.

118
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,983
There were some good times for us,
weren't there,

119
00:13:40,108 --> 00:13:41,314
on Pegasus?

120
00:13:44,433 --> 00:13:45,237
Yeah.

121
00:13:45,465 --> 00:13:47,120
I remember what you told me.

122
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:51,142
We had to keep the human race going.

123
00:13:52,223 --> 00:13:53,264
And you did.

124
00:13:54,347 --> 00:13:55,960
No, we did.

125
00:13:57,585 --> 00:13:59,768
I couldn't have done
it without you, Dee.

126
00:13:59,893 --> 00:14:01,439
You will this time, too.

127
00:14:02,823 --> 00:14:04,184
I don't know how.

128
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:08,439
I don't know what the frak
I'm gonna tell the Quorum.

129
00:14:10,276 --> 00:14:11,497
Good news is...

130
00:14:12,287 --> 00:14:13,599
Real estate prices are low.

131
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,985
Truth is, there is no happy way
to spin this thing.

132
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,063
So don't.

133
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:20,667
Tell them the truth.

134
00:14:21,396 --> 00:14:25,324
That's what people need to hear,
and they need to hear it from you.

135
00:14:28,287 --> 00:14:31,921
If anybody can give them
a reason to go on...

136
00:14:34,119 --> 00:14:35,222
it's you,

137
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:37,735
Apollo.

138
00:14:57,795 --> 00:14:58,975
Would you...

139
00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:04,717
I was gonna grab
a drink around 19:00.

140
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:08,310
Would you join me?

141
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:14,786
It's a date.

142
00:15:56,287 --> 00:15:57,678
Help me, godsdamn it!

143
00:17:36,437 --> 00:17:39,710
If you've got an explanation for this,
now's the time.

144
00:17:43,211 --> 00:17:44,746
I don't have one.

145
00:17:50,894 --> 00:17:51,987
I was wrong.

146
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:56,690
About Earth.

147
00:17:59,358 --> 00:18:00,522
Your hybrid...

148
00:18:01,189 --> 00:18:02,606
told me something.

149
00:18:04,475 --> 00:18:08,668
Said that I was the harbinger of death.
That I would lead us all to our end.

150
00:18:10,283 --> 00:18:11,668
She told you that?

151
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:14,681
Is it true?

152
00:18:17,239 --> 00:18:18,243
Is it true?

153
00:18:20,792 --> 00:18:23,392
If that's me lying there,
then what am I?

154
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,325
What am I?

155
00:18:33,331 --> 00:18:34,627
What am I?

156
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,234
"So let us not talk falsely now

157
00:19:33,408 --> 00:19:35,556
"'cause the hour is getting late."

158
00:20:07,698 --> 00:20:09,348
You remember something?

159
00:20:11,928 --> 00:20:12,932
Yeah.

160
00:20:16,834 --> 00:20:18,334
I used to live here.

161
00:20:20,114 --> 00:20:21,131
Me too.

162
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,940
That song that switched us on?

163
00:20:27,797 --> 00:20:28,897
I played it.

164
00:20:29,682 --> 00:20:31,181
For a woman I loved.

165
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:32,986
I remember.

166
00:20:37,604 --> 00:20:38,608
You do?

167
00:20:40,057 --> 00:20:41,957
You played it for all of us.

168
00:20:45,113 --> 00:20:46,213
That was me.

169
00:20:48,027 --> 00:20:49,731
We died in a holocaust.

170
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:54,333
Then why are we still alive?
That happened 2,000 years ago.

171
00:20:56,076 --> 00:20:57,669
How did we get to the colonies?

172
00:20:58,326 --> 00:21:00,476
Come to think that we were human?

173
00:21:00,601 --> 00:21:03,230
2,000 years
is a long time to forget.

174
00:21:25,214 --> 00:21:27,866
We gotta do something.
Morale is going down the toilet.

175
00:21:28,358 --> 00:21:29,808
What are you doing?

176
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,175
The pythian prophecy.

177
00:21:38,995 --> 00:21:42,845
Cottle told me that you didn't show up
for your Doloxan treatment.

178
00:21:43,075 --> 00:21:44,219
That's right.

179
00:21:44,968 --> 00:21:46,885
Do you want to tell me why?

180
00:21:47,053 --> 00:21:48,387
I didn't feel like it.

181
00:21:49,813 --> 00:21:51,513
You're gonna reschedule.

182
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:54,389
I don't think so.

183
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:58,833
Laura, you need your treatments.

184
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:01,608
No, I don't.

185
00:22:03,379 --> 00:22:04,819
What are you doing?

186
00:22:07,137 --> 00:22:08,487
You just gonna...

187
00:22:09,057 --> 00:22:10,457
lie down and quit?

188
00:22:13,788 --> 00:22:17,666
- You made me believe in this.
- You shouldn't have listened to me.

189
00:22:19,477 --> 00:22:21,527
When the Cylons first attacked,

190
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:25,076
you should've held your ground
and kept fighting.

191
00:22:26,322 --> 00:22:27,822
Because I was wrong.

192
00:22:28,203 --> 00:22:30,153
I was wrong about everything.

193
00:22:33,053 --> 00:22:35,253
And all those people who listened,

194
00:22:36,033 --> 00:22:37,533
and they trusted me,

195
00:22:38,296 --> 00:22:39,840
and they followed me,

196
00:22:40,222 --> 00:22:41,672
all those people...

197
00:22:43,552 --> 00:22:44,776
They're dead.

198
00:22:46,433 --> 00:22:48,483
- That's not...
- Don't, stop.

199
00:22:57,234 --> 00:22:58,484
Don't touch me.

200
00:23:01,874 --> 00:23:02,942
Just go.

201
00:23:24,733 --> 00:23:25,737
Burn.

202
00:23:27,097 --> 00:23:28,140
Burn.

203
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,578
Tell me again.

204
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:04,371
- You've heard it three times, Dee.
- I want to remember every word.

205
00:25:04,496 --> 00:25:06,887
All right, I said,

206
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,727
"Ladies and gentlemen,
we now have a choice.

207
00:25:09,852 --> 00:25:12,770
"We can either view this
as a catastrophe

208
00:25:12,895 --> 00:25:14,345
"or an opportunity.

209
00:25:15,938 --> 00:25:17,514
"I, Lee Adama...

210
00:25:18,239 --> 00:25:21,893
"ex-acting president, former commander
of the obliterated Battlestar Pegasus,

211
00:25:22,018 --> 00:25:25,412
"Apollo to my friends,
I choose the latter.

212
00:25:26,028 --> 00:25:29,105
"We're no longer enslaved
by the ramblings of Pythia.

213
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:32,702
"No longer pecking at the breadcrumbs
of the Thirteenth Tribe.

214
00:25:32,827 --> 00:25:36,038
"We are now free
to go where we want to go...

215
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,116
"and be who we want to be."

216
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:42,650
I'm so proud.

217
00:25:44,696 --> 00:25:47,162
I think I managed
to stall a full scale panic,

218
00:25:47,287 --> 00:25:49,669
but I got no idea what to do next.

219
00:25:54,134 --> 00:25:56,334
That is the best fun I have had...

220
00:25:56,651 --> 00:25:58,927
In a long, long time.

221
00:25:59,829 --> 00:26:01,278
Thank you for that.

222
00:27:06,078 --> 00:27:07,921
- What?
- You're glowing.

223
00:27:09,287 --> 00:27:10,291
Am I?

224
00:27:12,102 --> 00:27:15,223
All I can think of is
that waste of a planet.

225
00:27:16,715 --> 00:27:17,740
Please.

226
00:27:19,321 --> 00:27:22,614
I just want to hang on
to this feeling for as long as I can.

227
00:27:29,959 --> 00:27:31,019
Look at that.

228
00:27:31,831 --> 00:27:33,924
Little Anna's got her smile back.

229
00:27:34,801 --> 00:27:37,318
Sometimes I don't even
remember that's me.

230
00:27:37,967 --> 00:27:39,363
It's so long ago.

231
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,698
She has no frakkin' idea
what's ahead of her.

232
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:44,299
None of us do.

233
00:28:32,382 --> 00:28:34,657
Oh, my gods, help!

234
00:28:42,151 --> 00:28:44,397
No, no, no, it's gonna be okay.

235
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:46,679
- We need a medic.
- She's gonna be okay.

236
00:28:48,859 --> 00:28:50,515
We need a medic here!

237
00:28:51,006 --> 00:28:52,366
We need a medic!

238
00:28:55,182 --> 00:28:56,116
Frak.

239
00:28:59,494 --> 00:29:00,901
Medic!

240
00:29:32,047 --> 00:29:34,304
She kissed me good night
45 minutes ago,

241
00:29:34,429 --> 00:29:35,769
and there was...

242
00:29:36,863 --> 00:29:38,089
joy in her eyes.

243
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:43,176
So tell me why would she do this?

244
00:29:50,258 --> 00:29:51,793
I don't frakkin' know.

245
00:29:59,629 --> 00:30:00,616
No.

246
00:30:38,647 --> 00:30:40,391
What did you do?

247
00:30:57,365 --> 00:30:58,702
I let you down.

248
00:31:06,885 --> 00:31:08,392
I let everybody down.

249
00:31:13,942 --> 00:31:15,615
- Give me your sidearm.
- Sir?

250
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,950
Frakkin' now!

251
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,822
- Leave it loaded.
- Yes, sir.

252
00:32:14,112 --> 00:32:18,098
I think we should have that little
heart to heart you've been pining for.

253
00:32:21,198 --> 00:32:22,605
Sit down, Cylon.

254
00:32:23,596 --> 00:32:26,317
Looks like you've got
a head start on me, Bill.

255
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:29,397
And it looks like you still don't know
when to shut your frakkin' mouth

256
00:32:29,522 --> 00:32:30,694
and follow orders.

257
00:32:44,417 --> 00:32:46,946
Bill, I am so sorry

258
00:32:47,071 --> 00:32:49,431
that I didn't have the guts
to tell you

259
00:32:49,556 --> 00:32:51,263
when I first found out.

260
00:32:51,388 --> 00:32:52,512
Frak you!

261
00:32:56,611 --> 00:32:58,341
You got no guts.

262
00:32:59,576 --> 00:33:01,308
You're a frakkin' machine.

263
00:33:07,148 --> 00:33:08,648
Is that how it worked?

264
00:33:09,442 --> 00:33:11,586
They program you to be my friend?

265
00:33:12,762 --> 00:33:13,762
Emulate...

266
00:33:14,574 --> 00:33:16,809
all the qualities I respect.

267
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:21,202
Tell me jokes...

268
00:33:22,516 --> 00:33:24,233
and I'd laugh at them.

269
00:33:25,002 --> 00:33:25,949
Bill...

270
00:33:27,654 --> 00:33:29,825
I was your friend
because I chose to be.

271
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:31,046
I wanted to be.

272
00:33:37,133 --> 00:33:38,261
Ah, Ellen.

273
00:33:40,037 --> 00:33:43,796
Yeah, you know, Ellen was smarter
than I gave her credit for.

274
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:46,539
- Don't go there, Bill.
- Smarter than me.

275
00:33:47,021 --> 00:33:50,115
She knew from the beginning
that there was something wrong with you.

276
00:33:50,834 --> 00:33:54,599
That's why she went around
frakkin' half the colonial fleet.

277
00:33:54,724 --> 00:33:57,989
- Shut your mouth!
- Searching out, trying to find a man

278
00:33:59,236 --> 00:34:01,354
who had real blood

279
00:34:01,479 --> 00:34:02,575
in his main vein.

280
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,449
Shut your frakkin' mouth!

281
00:34:05,623 --> 00:34:07,307
She came on to me once.

282
00:34:08,074 --> 00:34:10,326
Like a dog in heat, I could smell.

283
00:34:10,451 --> 00:34:11,950
I could smell it...

284
00:34:12,485 --> 00:34:14,339
she smelled so good.

285
00:34:14,702 --> 00:34:17,926
Go on, do it, do it, do it!

286
00:34:19,232 --> 00:34:20,557
Or I will.

287
00:34:20,682 --> 00:34:22,722
Go on, go on.

288
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:27,298
Do it.

289
00:34:29,385 --> 00:34:30,513
Go on.

290
00:34:37,637 --> 00:34:38,863
Oh, my Gods.

291
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:41,777
That's why you came here.

292
00:34:42,762 --> 00:34:43,890
To do this.

293
00:34:45,513 --> 00:34:48,122
You haven't got the frakkin' guts

294
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:49,598
to do it yourself.

295
00:34:57,552 --> 00:35:01,000
I'm sorry, Bill.
This is one time I can't help you.

296
00:35:26,022 --> 00:35:27,870
I think we've both had enough.

297
00:35:48,662 --> 00:35:51,906
Did I ever tell you
about my summers with my uncle

298
00:35:52,031 --> 00:35:53,337
when I was a kid?

299
00:35:57,975 --> 00:35:58,949
Foxes...

300
00:36:00,788 --> 00:36:02,640
would attack his henhouse

301
00:36:03,613 --> 00:36:04,946
all the time.

302
00:36:05,762 --> 00:36:07,261
Really pissed him off.

303
00:36:08,345 --> 00:36:09,670
He'd wake me up.

304
00:36:10,403 --> 00:36:13,934
We'd go with his hounds
at night up into the hills

305
00:36:14,059 --> 00:36:15,889
looking for the fox.

306
00:36:16,014 --> 00:36:18,255
When the dogs smelled the scent,

307
00:36:19,456 --> 00:36:21,019
they'd go crazy.

308
00:36:22,371 --> 00:36:24,632
The pack would become a team.

309
00:36:27,317 --> 00:36:28,838
Forced the fox...

310
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:31,142
toward the river.

311
00:36:32,904 --> 00:36:35,646
So what would the foxes do?

312
00:36:36,141 --> 00:36:37,855
Half would turn and fight.

313
00:36:39,341 --> 00:36:41,976
The other half
would try to swim across.

314
00:36:43,089 --> 00:36:45,039
But my uncle told me about

315
00:36:45,407 --> 00:36:46,463
a few that...

316
00:36:50,483 --> 00:36:52,329
They'd swim halfway out,

317
00:36:53,081 --> 00:36:54,373
turn with the current,

318
00:36:55,243 --> 00:36:57,828
and ride it all the way out to sea.

319
00:36:58,186 --> 00:36:59,670
Fishermen would find them

320
00:37:00,048 --> 00:37:01,726
a mile offshore just...

321
00:37:02,683 --> 00:37:03,686
swimming.

322
00:37:05,939 --> 00:37:08,469
Because they wanted to drown.

323
00:37:10,462 --> 00:37:11,447
Maybe.

324
00:37:15,094 --> 00:37:16,799
Or maybe they were just...

325
00:37:18,809 --> 00:37:19,812
tired.

326
00:37:25,425 --> 00:37:27,796
Well, godsdamn it, Bill.

327
00:37:29,282 --> 00:37:31,276
We can't swim out to sea.

328
00:37:31,401 --> 00:37:33,567
I am the XO of this ship.

329
00:37:33,872 --> 00:37:35,915
You are the commanding officer.

330
00:37:36,781 --> 00:37:40,373
How is putting a bullet in your head
gonna help Dee?

331
00:37:40,498 --> 00:37:43,297
It is sure as frak
isn't gonna help all the others

332
00:37:43,465 --> 00:37:46,367
who are thinking about doing
the same godsdamn thing.

333
00:37:46,859 --> 00:37:50,557
And what are they gonna do
without the old man here

334
00:37:50,682 --> 00:37:51,889
to lead them?

335
00:37:56,189 --> 00:37:57,954
Lead them where, Saul?

336
00:38:31,805 --> 00:38:34,723
I hear you lost the signal.
You couldn't find the source.

337
00:38:40,314 --> 00:38:43,691
I need to talk. I've gotta...
tell somebody.

338
00:38:49,121 --> 00:38:50,544
You look like hell.

339
00:38:50,866 --> 00:38:52,285
What's going on?

340
00:38:56,452 --> 00:38:57,674
What about Dee?

341
00:39:01,449 --> 00:39:02,580
She shot herself.

342
00:39:04,691 --> 00:39:05,587
My Gods.

343
00:39:09,624 --> 00:39:11,302
I don't understand.

344
00:39:12,551 --> 00:39:14,283
No, neither do I, you know.

345
00:39:15,104 --> 00:39:16,034
I'm trying

346
00:39:16,718 --> 00:39:18,475
to come up with a neat answer.

347
00:39:18,806 --> 00:39:20,220
But truth is,

348
00:39:23,849 --> 00:39:25,034
I'll never know.

349
00:39:27,404 --> 00:39:28,955
'Cause it's too frakkin' late.

350
00:40:10,194 --> 00:40:11,224
Mr. Hoshi.

351
00:40:12,163 --> 00:40:13,385
Take over for

352
00:40:13,823 --> 00:40:15,118
Lieutenant Dualla.

353
00:40:18,638 --> 00:40:19,750
Mr. Gaeta.

354
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:26,294
Find me
the closest G, F or K class star system.

355
00:40:31,628 --> 00:40:33,844
Get the Cylon baseship on the horn.

356
00:40:35,512 --> 00:40:38,194
See if our new allies
want to come along for the ride.

357
00:40:53,981 --> 00:40:55,850
Men and women of the fleet.

358
00:40:57,528 --> 00:40:59,196
This is the admiral.

359
00:41:00,482 --> 00:41:01,791
<i>The discoveries</i>

360
00:41:02,568 --> 00:41:04,122
<i>of the past few days</i>

361
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:07,166
<i>have been painful for all of us.</i>

362
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,598
As you know,

363
00:41:11,993 --> 00:41:13,771
we cannot stay on Earth.

364
00:41:14,948 --> 00:41:16,762
<i>But this is not a new challenge.</i>

365
00:41:17,702 --> 00:41:19,753
<i>The Thirteen tribes of Kobol</i>

366
00:41:20,473 --> 00:41:23,775
<i>stood exactly on the same spot
that we are right now.</i>

367
00:41:25,133 --> 00:41:27,385
<i>They experienced dreadful losses.</i>

368
00:41:28,115 --> 00:41:29,154
<i>Their planet</i>

369
00:41:30,066 --> 00:41:31,279
<i>was a graveyard.</i>

370
00:41:32,501 --> 00:41:33,768
<i>They needed a home.</i>

371
00:41:36,012 --> 00:41:38,847
<i>So they set out
in the void of deep space</i>

372
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:42,891
<i>with nothing but their ships
and their guts.</i>

373
00:41:44,405 --> 00:41:45,554
<i>And the Thirteen</i>

374
00:41:46,502 --> 00:41:47,728
<i>succeeded.</i>

375
00:41:52,876 --> 00:41:54,832
<i>They weren't supermen.</i>

376
00:41:55,949 --> 00:41:57,909
<i>They were ordinary people</i>

377
00:41:58,034 --> 00:41:59,049
<i>like us.</i>

378
00:42:02,167 --> 00:42:04,101
<i>What they can accomplish,</i>

379
00:42:04,967 --> 00:42:06,189
<i>we can accomplish.</i>

380
00:42:07,803 --> 00:42:09,758
<i>We will find a new home.</i>

381
00:42:12,189 --> 00:42:13,358
<i>This is a promise</i>

382
00:42:15,476 --> 00:42:17,007
<i>I intend to keep.</i>

383
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:26,601
All right, people, pack it up.

384
00:42:26,726 --> 00:42:29,266
We're off this rock in 15 minutes.

385
00:42:32,777 --> 00:42:35,932
You'd better get back to your ship.
The fleet is about to jump.

386
00:42:39,081 --> 00:42:40,339
I'm not going.

387
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:47,124
You know, all this is just gonna happen
again and again and again.

388
00:42:49,146 --> 00:42:51,517
So I'm getting off
this merry-go-round.

389
00:42:53,587 --> 00:42:55,310
I'll die here with my ancestors,

390
00:42:55,435 --> 00:42:58,511
and it beats the hell out of
being out there with Cavil.

391
00:43:00,675 --> 00:43:03,857
Gonna die in the cold and the dark
when Cavil catches up with us.

392
00:43:05,399 --> 00:43:07,459
Well, I wouldn't count
the old man out.

393
00:43:07,733 --> 00:43:09,484
He'll find us a home.

394
00:43:14,709 --> 00:43:17,344
Don't you ever want
to stop fighting it, colonel?

395
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:24,301
Don't you just want
to stop all of this?

396
00:43:28,607 --> 00:43:31,305
And just ride the tide out to sea.

397
00:44:44,365 --> 00:44:45,359
Saul!

398
00:44:52,001 --> 00:44:53,226
I'll get you out!

399
00:45:07,457 --> 00:45:08,624
It's okay.

400
00:45:10,995 --> 00:45:12,089
It's okay.

401
00:45:13,037 --> 00:45:14,724
Everything is in place.

402
00:45:16,853 --> 00:45:18,449
We'll be reborn...

403
00:45:19,484 --> 00:45:20,500
again.

404
00:45:23,173 --> 00:45:24,258
Together.

405
00:45:38,399 --> 00:45:40,400
Ellen, you're the Fifth.
