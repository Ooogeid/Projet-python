1
00:00:00,951 --> 00:00:03,123
<i>Previously on</i>
Battlestar Galactica...

2
00:00:04,253 --> 00:00:07,653
Looks like Mommy's gonna get
some sleep tonight after all.

3
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:10,343
Stay the frak away from me!

4
00:00:10,716 --> 00:00:12,678
I heard you. You're Cylons.

5
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,773
I know that you've been spending
a lot of time interrogating the Six.

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,151
I'm not torturing her,
if that's what you're worried about.

7
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,370
Cottle tells me she's pregnant.

8
00:00:31,224 --> 00:00:33,374
You just gonna lie down and quit?

9
00:00:33,587 --> 00:00:35,740
I was wrong about everything.

10
00:00:36,225 --> 00:00:38,746
And all those people who listened
and trusted me,

11
00:00:40,021 --> 00:00:41,205
they're dead.

12
00:00:41,713 --> 00:00:42,917
We'll find a new home.

13
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:45,978
This is a promise

14
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:47,654
<i>I intend to keep.</i>

15
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:51,166
Get the Cylon baseship on the horn.

16
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:55,647
See if our new allies
want to come along for the ride.

17
00:02:14,376 --> 00:02:16,218
"There is a languor of the life

18
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:20,021
"more imminent than pain.

19
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:22,977
"Tis pain's successor

20
00:02:25,617 --> 00:02:28,167
"when the soul
has suffered all it can."

21
00:02:30,591 --> 00:02:31,776
I don't see anything.

22
00:02:31,981 --> 00:02:34,136
- Wait, I see something.
- Where?

23
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:36,168
Right there. Wait. No?

24
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:38,293
- I thought I saw it.
- Saw what?

25
00:02:38,418 --> 00:02:40,667
Everyone shut the frak up
for a second.

26
00:02:40,792 --> 00:02:43,310
- Got it. There.
- Yeah, there it is.

27
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,479
I see it.

28
00:02:46,354 --> 00:02:47,504
I can see it!

29
00:02:48,437 --> 00:02:50,937
My God, there it is.
It's so beautiful.

30
00:02:53,229 --> 00:02:55,079
I still don't see anything.

31
00:02:55,603 --> 00:02:57,384
Try looking with your eyes...

32
00:02:58,292 --> 00:02:59,292
eye.

33
00:02:59,794 --> 00:03:00,994
Here, Colonel.

34
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,080
See, this is the head,

35
00:03:03,812 --> 00:03:06,363
shoulder, and there's a little hand.

36
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:08,813
I'll be damned.

37
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,325
It's our baby, Saul.

38
00:03:11,979 --> 00:03:12,979
Our baby.

39
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,402
I need a drink.

40
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:17,492
Here, next best thing.

41
00:03:23,533 --> 00:03:25,830
That's a lot of smoking
around a pregnant lady.

42
00:03:27,918 --> 00:03:29,018
She'll live.

43
00:03:30,642 --> 00:03:31,836
Look at that, Saul.

44
00:03:32,005 --> 00:03:34,155
Do you know what that is, really?

45
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:39,066
That's the future
of the entire Cylon race.

46
00:03:39,782 --> 00:03:43,997
Kid doesn't even have a name yet and
already loading up on the expectations.

47
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:46,567
All he has to do is be born.

48
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:51,661
No Cylon/Cylon pairing
has ever produced a child ever.

49
00:03:53,356 --> 00:03:55,256
Believe me, it's been tried.

50
00:03:57,447 --> 00:03:58,792
That means it's...

51
00:03:58,917 --> 00:04:02,921
That means it's possible for our race
to survive even without resurrection.

52
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,291
The Cylon nation will survive.

53
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,298
Ishay,

54
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:15,219
get me the fetal monitor. I want to
work up a complete biophysical profile

55
00:04:15,344 --> 00:04:17,321
on this... savior.

56
00:04:29,787 --> 00:04:30,981
Sorry, Felix.

57
00:04:31,106 --> 00:04:34,306
He's backed up today,
but he shouldn't be much longer.

58
00:04:34,718 --> 00:04:37,868
No problem. At least
the Cylons are having fun, right?

59
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,075
Earth's a cinder. Dee's dead.

60
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:48,876
Suicides are up. Fleet's a mess.
President's missing in action,

61
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:51,556
but, gotta make sure
the Cylons are taken care of.

62
00:04:51,681 --> 00:04:54,803
Rub this into the skin and it'll help
with the drying and the chaffing,okay?

63
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:58,088
No, no, frak. I've gone through
two jars of that stuff already.

64
00:04:58,257 --> 00:05:00,865
It doesn't do anything.
The end cap needs to be refitted.

65
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:03,886
I already told him it's too high
on one side, but he won't listen.

66
00:05:04,499 --> 00:05:06,240
I'm sorry, Felix.
I'm really sorry.

67
00:05:06,365 --> 00:05:09,324
I will get you in there
as soon as I can. It's just been crazy.

68
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:10,991
I need help!
I need help!

69
00:05:11,116 --> 00:05:13,604
- It's busy today, chief.
- He's peeing blood.

70
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:15,556
It's gonna be awhile.
get him to bed three.

71
00:05:15,681 --> 00:05:17,431
I'll go and get a Doctor.

72
00:05:19,456 --> 00:05:21,153
- Sorry.
- No problem.

73
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,490
- Ishay, where's the damn fetal monitor?
- Can't keep those toasters waiting.

74
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:25,615
Right.

75
00:05:30,179 --> 00:05:31,529
Admiral! Admiral!

76
00:05:33,182 --> 00:05:35,626
Is Colonel Tigh still serving
as executive officer,

77
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:39,694
and aren't you concerned about
having a Cylon as second in command?

78
00:05:40,866 --> 00:05:43,617
I'm not gonna discuss
military protocol or chain of command.

79
00:05:47,366 --> 00:05:50,308
Is it true you're contemplating forming
a permanent alliance

80
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,434
with the rebel Cylons
currently in this fleet?

81
00:05:52,804 --> 00:05:55,254
I'm not gonna talk
about hypotheticals.

82
00:05:55,906 --> 00:05:58,629
Mr. Vice President,
would you support such a move?

83
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:07,367
No comment.

84
00:06:08,804 --> 00:06:10,404
Serious! Unbelievable!

85
00:06:12,178 --> 00:06:14,331
Where is President Roslin?

86
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,209
Thank you, Playa.

87
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:19,645
The President is resting comfortably
aboard Galactica.

88
00:06:20,376 --> 00:06:21,576
Last question.

89
00:06:22,301 --> 00:06:23,179
Yes, Seku.

90
00:06:23,304 --> 00:06:26,740
Do you have any information
on the identity of the fifth Cylon?

91
00:06:26,865 --> 00:06:29,242
We believe
the fifth Cylon to be dead.

92
00:06:29,367 --> 00:06:30,867
But you're not sure.

93
00:06:31,366 --> 00:06:33,559
No, but we believe
she died some time ag...

94
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,311
- She?
- How do you know it was a woman?

95
00:06:38,255 --> 00:06:41,931
That was the last question.
Thank you all very much for coming.

96
00:06:44,678 --> 00:06:46,990
- I can't believe I said that.
- What was that about?

97
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,700
- Forget about it.
- Permanent alliance between

98
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:52,489
this government and the Cylons,
any Cylons, Is out of the question.

99
00:06:52,614 --> 00:06:54,972
- I hope you both know that.
- Yeah, it's not your call.

100
00:06:55,097 --> 00:06:56,206
Is it yours?

101
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,275
Are you the President again?

102
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,503
Sorry, I get confused
what your job is on any given day.

103
00:07:02,177 --> 00:07:05,303
Laura Roslin is still the President.
She'll make the final call.

104
00:07:05,428 --> 00:07:07,217
And where is Laura Roslin?

105
00:07:07,705 --> 00:07:10,591
That's right.
Resting comfortably aboard Galactica.

106
00:07:10,716 --> 00:07:12,224
Funny how she dropped out of sight

107
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:15,017
ever since her prophecies about Earth
turned out to be a bunch of crap.

108
00:07:16,524 --> 00:07:17,583
We're done here.

109
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:20,117
If you try to shove an alliance
with the Cylons down our throats,

110
00:07:20,242 --> 00:07:22,238
there'll be consequences, Admiral.

111
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,276
I promise you.

112
00:07:25,844 --> 00:07:27,291
Thank you, Mr. Zarek.

113
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,547
Makes it a little bit easier

114
00:07:32,075 --> 00:07:34,953
to know who to hold responsible
if there's an unfortunate incident.

115
00:07:40,997 --> 00:07:42,769
I'm not hard to find, Admiral.

116
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:44,338
I'm right here...

117
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:46,396
Running the government.

118
00:07:48,107 --> 00:07:49,126
For now.

119
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,650
-=( Lords of Kobol )=-

120
00:08:39,571 --> 00:08:42,759
The feeling on the baseship is
we'd rather take our chances with you

121
00:08:43,258 --> 00:08:45,941
than risk running
into Cavil's forces alone.

122
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,600
- We?
- Yeah.

123
00:08:48,008 --> 00:08:49,882
We... Cylons.

124
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,905
That description fit
anyone around here you know?

125
00:08:54,026 --> 00:08:55,909
Have this discussion another time.

126
00:08:56,695 --> 00:08:58,704
What about the FTL question?

127
00:08:59,319 --> 00:09:00,480
It's possible.

128
00:09:00,688 --> 00:09:02,587
It's labor-intensive,
a lot of grunt work,

129
00:09:02,712 --> 00:09:04,564
but we should be able to upgrade

130
00:09:05,216 --> 00:09:08,375
all the jump drives in the entire fleet
with Cylon technology.

131
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,799
Not gonna be easy
to sell the Quorum on this one.

132
00:09:11,068 --> 00:09:12,246
Frak the Quorum.

133
00:09:12,371 --> 00:09:14,720
These are civilian ships.
What are you gonna do?

134
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:16,400
Upgrade their engines at gunpoint?

135
00:09:16,525 --> 00:09:18,825
We need the Quorum
to get civilian cooperation.

136
00:09:19,867 --> 00:09:20,886
All right.

137
00:09:21,542 --> 00:09:23,896
What'll it take
to get the Quorum to sign off?

138
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:28,675
The first issue is gonna be
whether we can make these upgrades

139
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,479
with Galactica personnel only.

140
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,637
It's one thing to accept
Cylon technology.

141
00:09:33,762 --> 00:09:37,295
It's quite another to have
actual Cylons aboard their ships.

142
00:09:37,866 --> 00:09:40,209
I barely understand this stuff,
and I'm...

143
00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:45,013
We are gonna need teams

144
00:09:45,522 --> 00:09:47,092
of Sharons and Sixes,

145
00:09:47,438 --> 00:09:50,066
possibly Leobens,
just to do the installations.

146
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,787
- They'll go nuts.
- We gotta sell 'em on it.

147
00:09:52,912 --> 00:09:54,437
Point out the benefits.

148
00:09:55,007 --> 00:09:58,043
Athena tells me the upgrades
should triple the fleet's jump capacity.

149
00:09:58,168 --> 00:09:59,184
Absolutely.

150
00:09:59,309 --> 00:10:00,805
And that's conservative.

151
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:02,781
Their technology...

152
00:10:03,413 --> 00:10:05,838
Our technology
is way ahead of ours...

153
00:10:07,101 --> 00:10:08,119
Yours.

154
00:10:08,384 --> 00:10:11,235
Maybe you'd like a chart
to keep it all straight.

155
00:10:14,204 --> 00:10:15,739
- What do you think?
- Well...

156
00:10:18,022 --> 00:10:20,384
Tripling jump capacity
triples our chances

157
00:10:20,509 --> 00:10:23,574
of finding a habitable planet
before we run out of food and fuel.

158
00:10:24,644 --> 00:10:27,152
- That I might be able to sell.
- What's the catch?

159
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:31,558
Because there is a catch, right,
former-chief?

160
00:10:36,194 --> 00:10:39,137
We want to be part of the fleet.
Not just along for the ride.

161
00:10:40,366 --> 00:10:42,849
Full members, citizens,
seat at the Quorum, the whole thing.

162
00:10:43,714 --> 00:10:45,616
- Are you insane?
- It's non-negotiable.

163
00:10:46,065 --> 00:10:47,776
You want Cylon technology.

164
00:10:48,084 --> 00:10:49,982
We want safety
in case Cavil's forces arrive.

165
00:10:50,151 --> 00:10:51,717
Now, if we're citizens,

166
00:10:52,187 --> 00:10:53,225
your oath...

167
00:10:53,672 --> 00:10:55,994
states that you protect us
just like everybody else.

168
00:10:56,119 --> 00:10:57,698
And the other Cylons,

169
00:10:58,113 --> 00:11:01,312
they really think
that that will guarantee your safety?

170
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,191
Yes, they do.

171
00:11:05,577 --> 00:11:08,857
I've convinced them the Admiral takes
these sorts of things very seriously.

172
00:11:09,203 --> 00:11:11,200
That he would rather lose the fleet

173
00:11:11,668 --> 00:11:12,857
than break the oath.

174
00:11:12,982 --> 00:11:14,732
Unlike certain other people.

175
00:11:15,037 --> 00:11:16,952
Unlike certain other people.

176
00:11:18,582 --> 00:11:21,557
I understand the argument.

177
00:11:22,706 --> 00:11:24,988
It makes sense
from their perspective.

178
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,739
You're not seriously
thinking about this.

179
00:11:28,472 --> 00:11:29,472
Sir.

180
00:11:31,266 --> 00:11:33,734
You're not seriously
thinking about this, sir.

181
00:11:35,199 --> 00:11:37,929
All options are on the table,
Mr. Gaeta.

182
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:42,879
This is a political decision.

183
00:11:43,566 --> 00:11:45,726
I'll have to run it
by the President.

184
00:11:46,253 --> 00:11:47,468
Thank you all.

185
00:11:49,413 --> 00:11:51,186
Admiral, can I have a word?

186
00:11:58,267 --> 00:11:59,876
Acute renal failure.

187
00:12:00,001 --> 00:12:02,973
I think we caught it in time
to manage with dialysis.

188
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:05,305
However, there is a chance

189
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:08,036
that this could lead
to chronic renal failure.

190
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:09,565
And if that happens,

191
00:12:10,502 --> 00:12:12,022
he's gonna lose a kidney.

192
00:12:20,443 --> 00:12:22,338
What's the next step? What do I do?

193
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:25,994
Do I give some blood?
Build up a supply?

194
00:12:27,889 --> 00:12:30,248
We have enough of his type
in the blood bank.

195
00:12:31,134 --> 00:12:32,626
He's half-Cylon.

196
00:12:34,027 --> 00:12:36,546
You got a lot of half-Cylon blood
just lying around, do you?

197
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,406
No, you're right.
I hadn't thought about that.

198
00:12:39,943 --> 00:12:42,958
We should tap a vein
and start a supply right away.

199
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,955
This is ridiculous,
you have to tell him.

200
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,098
Tell me what?

201
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:47,682
This little boy could die.

202
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:50,060
- His father should know.
- Ishay, zip it!

203
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:53,811
What the hell is she talking about?

204
00:12:55,522 --> 00:12:57,526
We'll talk about this later.

205
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,186
I guess you better come with me.

206
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,563
Hey, buddy. How's it going?

207
00:13:12,733 --> 00:13:13,751
All right.

208
00:13:14,607 --> 00:13:16,339
This is gonna be a shock.

209
00:13:16,464 --> 00:13:18,152
But I want you to know
that I was bound

210
00:13:18,277 --> 00:13:20,495
by Doctor-patient confidentiality
in this.

211
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,256
Even though she's dead now,
it's still applied.

212
00:13:25,599 --> 00:13:26,617
Cally?

213
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,490
You're talking about Cally.

214
00:13:30,361 --> 00:13:31,868
What the frak does she...

215
00:13:40,978 --> 00:13:42,446
I'm not his father, am I?

216
00:13:43,321 --> 00:13:44,321
I'm sorry.

217
00:13:45,928 --> 00:13:49,310
She found out she was pregnant
just before you got married.

218
00:13:49,435 --> 00:13:51,827
She wasn't sure
that you were the father.

219
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,740
She wanted me
to terminate the pregnancy.

220
00:13:54,865 --> 00:13:57,674
The procedure is illegal,
but there are ways around it.

221
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:59,752
However, she decided to keep it.

222
00:14:00,616 --> 00:14:02,896
Then later on she asked me
to do a paternity test

223
00:14:03,021 --> 00:14:04,650
because she wanted to know.

224
00:14:06,422 --> 00:14:07,706
And it wasn't me.

225
00:14:13,068 --> 00:14:13,810
Who?

226
00:14:14,548 --> 00:14:16,137
He doesn't know either.

227
00:14:16,524 --> 00:14:19,149
And I'll be damned if he's gonna
find out that he's a father

228
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:23,069
from a pissed-off former deck chief
with a Cylon chip on his shoulder.

229
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:26,066
No, I'll have to tell him.

230
00:14:27,194 --> 00:14:30,495
I'll tell him, and then the two of you
can work it out on your own.

231
00:14:42,296 --> 00:14:43,559
Take care of him.

232
00:14:48,642 --> 00:14:49,642
Great.

233
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:54,385
You know the President's stopped
returning my calls.

234
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,751
She's going through a rough patch.

235
00:14:56,876 --> 00:14:58,055
We all are.

236
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:00,379
She'll get through it.

237
00:15:00,991 --> 00:15:02,359
Just take time.

238
00:15:07,169 --> 00:15:09,838
But we're gonna need to know
her stance on this citizenship thing

239
00:15:09,963 --> 00:15:11,408
sooner rather than later.

240
00:15:14,148 --> 00:15:16,078
I'll talk to you about it later.

241
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,019
Get me the President.

242
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:49,468
If we can sway public
opinion towards us...

243
00:16:49,755 --> 00:16:52,279
Or, at least not against us...

244
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:55,356
He thinks that Zarek
and the Quorum can be handled.

245
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:57,028
He's probably right.

246
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,225
I'm so stiff.

247
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,395
- Are you sure you're up for this?
- Yeah, just...

248
00:17:05,497 --> 00:17:08,125
I'm just stretching,
a little aerobics.

249
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,774
Truth is, I haven't felt
this good in months.

250
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,085
It hurts, but it's good.

251
00:17:16,621 --> 00:17:19,667
When do you have to go in
for another Doloxan treatment?

252
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:22,904
Tomorrow.

253
00:17:25,535 --> 00:17:26,341
Good.

254
00:17:28,749 --> 00:17:30,340
Lee thinks, and I agree with him,

255
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:33,280
that you should address the fleet.

256
00:17:33,405 --> 00:17:35,258
Make a public declaration

257
00:17:36,311 --> 00:17:38,885
that an alliance with the Cylons

258
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:41,544
is critical
for our long-term survival.

259
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:47,173
Sure. Not just yet, though.
I need a little time.

260
00:17:49,395 --> 00:17:50,924
That's what I told him.

261
00:17:55,966 --> 00:17:57,210
We need you, Laura.

262
00:17:57,335 --> 00:17:59,740
I know that you're tired,
but we need you.

263
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:01,931
I hear you.

264
00:18:03,572 --> 00:18:05,051
I do, trust me.

265
00:18:05,665 --> 00:18:07,097
I need a little time.

266
00:18:08,619 --> 00:18:09,460
Go.

267
00:18:10,542 --> 00:18:11,285
Go.

268
00:18:13,683 --> 00:18:16,215
- Just don't overdo it, all right?
- I won't.

269
00:18:45,715 --> 00:18:46,965
Captain Thrace.

270
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,586
Whatever it is,
I'm not in the mood, Felix.

271
00:18:50,801 --> 00:18:53,596
Oh, so you think I should
give a frak about your mood.

272
00:18:56,298 --> 00:18:58,329
Okay, let's have it.

273
00:18:59,384 --> 00:19:02,307
- You tried to throw me out an airlock.
- Still crying about that?

274
00:19:03,891 --> 00:19:05,741
The charges at the time were

275
00:19:05,866 --> 00:19:08,229
collaborating with an enemy
in a time of war.

276
00:19:09,054 --> 00:19:10,751
Waiting for the punch line.

277
00:19:11,472 --> 00:19:13,850
It turns out the jury
that convicted me was made

278
00:19:13,975 --> 00:19:15,456
of two Cylons

279
00:19:16,026 --> 00:19:17,571
and a woman married to a Cylon.

280
00:19:17,751 --> 00:19:18,989
Rim shot!

281
00:19:19,402 --> 00:19:22,614
Big laugh, applause,
applause, applause.

282
00:19:25,534 --> 00:19:26,562
Are we done?

283
00:19:27,464 --> 00:19:30,756
Oh, no, wait. I'm sorry, I forgot.
We haven't gotten to the leg yet.

284
00:19:34,188 --> 00:19:37,370
50 billion people are dead, and I'm
supposed to give a frak about your leg?

285
00:19:37,495 --> 00:19:39,095
Who killed those 50 billion people?

286
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,763
- It wasn't me.
- No, it was your husband.

287
00:19:45,682 --> 00:19:47,365
Are you enjoying yourself?

288
00:19:48,394 --> 00:19:50,869
Is this how you get
your kicks these days?

289
00:19:51,443 --> 00:19:53,699
Oh wait, I'm sorry.
I meant half-kicks.

290
00:19:56,827 --> 00:19:58,993
What was Sam doing on Caprica

291
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,930
before he so conveniently met you?

292
00:20:02,352 --> 00:20:03,589
You ever wonder?

293
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,746
You think maybe he...
nuked a few cities?

294
00:20:07,603 --> 00:20:09,703
Executed a few thousand prisoners?

295
00:20:10,138 --> 00:20:11,445
I'm just wondering.

296
00:20:13,575 --> 00:20:15,338
Well, then again,
maybe you're a Cylon too.

297
00:20:16,452 --> 00:20:18,023
At least I'm not a gimp.

298
00:20:22,267 --> 00:20:25,340
One day, one day soon,
there's gonna be a reckoning, Kara.

299
00:20:25,988 --> 00:20:28,977
And once again people are gonna
have to answer for what they've done.

300
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:31,355
Is that a threat?

301
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:35,185
You're godsdamn right
that's a threat.

302
00:20:37,953 --> 00:20:40,095
Well, you know
where to find me, Felix.

303
00:20:42,706 --> 00:20:44,538
And in case you're wondering,

304
00:20:45,334 --> 00:20:47,559
I will definitely hit a cripple.

305
00:20:50,712 --> 00:20:51,942
Or anyone else.

306
00:20:55,156 --> 00:20:57,901
So I guess a pity frak's
out of the question then?

307
00:21:06,885 --> 00:21:08,224
Somebody close that hatch.

308
00:21:11,044 --> 00:21:12,149
Let's talk.

309
00:21:13,748 --> 00:21:14,951
Point of order!

310
00:21:15,868 --> 00:21:17,468
Point of order, please!

311
00:21:18,055 --> 00:21:20,862
The chair exercises its right
to bring a motion forward.

312
00:21:22,358 --> 00:21:23,377
In prison,

313
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:27,088
you start to confuse
your hopes and dreams

314
00:21:27,516 --> 00:21:28,684
with reality.

315
00:21:30,828 --> 00:21:31,983
You start to...

316
00:21:33,204 --> 00:21:36,012
believe that because
you want something to happen...

317
00:21:36,764 --> 00:21:39,200
parole, a pardon, appeal, a writ...

318
00:21:39,325 --> 00:21:42,204
you start to believe
that it will happen.

319
00:21:42,906 --> 00:21:45,339
You live on wishes.

320
00:21:46,417 --> 00:21:49,351
The way things should be,
instead of the way they are.

321
00:21:50,748 --> 00:21:53,542
And all because
you can't face reality.

322
00:21:55,434 --> 00:21:57,827
The leaders of this fleet are
succumbing to wishful thinking

323
00:21:57,952 --> 00:21:59,879
because they can't face reality.

324
00:22:00,004 --> 00:22:03,675
And the reality is
that the Roslin-Adama administration

325
00:22:04,609 --> 00:22:06,361
has led us nowhere.

326
00:22:07,229 --> 00:22:09,286
Earth was a mirage,

327
00:22:09,582 --> 00:22:12,852
a fantasy they dangled
in front of us for four long years

328
00:22:12,977 --> 00:22:14,352
in order to maintain power.

329
00:22:14,477 --> 00:22:16,120
A fantasy they dreamed up

330
00:22:16,245 --> 00:22:18,784
as a way to hold on and control
the government

331
00:22:18,909 --> 00:22:22,608
over the democratic
wishes of the population.

332
00:22:23,729 --> 00:22:24,565
So now

333
00:22:25,149 --> 00:22:28,207
what is our feckless
and dispirited leadership doing

334
00:22:28,332 --> 00:22:29,798
to solidify their position

335
00:22:29,923 --> 00:22:33,685
after failing us so miserably?

336
00:22:34,275 --> 00:22:35,833
Turning to the Cylons.

337
00:22:36,908 --> 00:22:38,103
The Cylons...

338
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:39,462
For help.

339
00:22:41,153 --> 00:22:44,862
Aren't the Cylons the reason
we're out here in the first place?

340
00:22:45,134 --> 00:22:47,303
Aren't they the enemy?

341
00:22:47,589 --> 00:22:50,120
Or are they suddenly our friends

342
00:22:50,245 --> 00:22:54,023
if that helps keep
Roslin-Adama in power?

343
00:22:54,148 --> 00:22:56,707
Point of order. The chair needs
to bring a motion, not make a speech.

344
00:22:56,832 --> 00:22:58,250
Thank you, Mr. Adama.

345
00:22:59,963 --> 00:23:01,729
The chair moves that any decision

346
00:23:01,854 --> 00:23:04,309
on allowing Cylons
to board any ship in this fleet

347
00:23:04,434 --> 00:23:06,645
be made by the Captain
and the people living on that ship,

348
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:09,236
and not the Roslin-Adama
administration.

349
00:23:09,361 --> 00:23:12,023
What we need right now is unity.
This is a fleet-wide issue.

350
00:23:12,148 --> 00:23:14,100
We need to stand together.
It affects all of us.

351
00:23:14,681 --> 00:23:17,258
Sagittaron calls the question.

352
00:23:17,383 --> 00:23:18,353
Tauron seconds.

353
00:23:18,526 --> 00:23:21,038
Question has been called and seconded.
All in favor?

354
00:23:21,163 --> 00:23:22,386
All opposed?

355
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,708
Vote is 11 to 1.
Motion carries.

356
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:26,981
No Cylon will board a ship
in this fleet

357
00:23:27,106 --> 00:23:29,185
without permission of its people.

358
00:23:35,975 --> 00:23:37,024
Thank you.

359
00:24:25,565 --> 00:24:26,288
What?

360
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:34,013
Mother-frakkin' son of a...

361
00:25:41,453 --> 00:25:42,899
It's a big ship.

362
00:25:44,545 --> 00:25:46,624
- You ran the whole route?
- Half.

363
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,667
It's more than I've run in...
a long time.

364
00:25:51,584 --> 00:25:52,738
You're flushed.

365
00:25:52,863 --> 00:25:54,845
- You look good.
- Thank you.

366
00:25:55,527 --> 00:25:57,263
You're not supposed to look good.

367
00:25:58,113 --> 00:26:01,214
You're supposed to be in sickbay
with a tube in your arm.

368
00:26:02,621 --> 00:26:03,890
Changed my mind.

369
00:26:05,451 --> 00:26:06,505
Like hell.

370
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:09,527
You never intended to go.

371
00:26:11,146 --> 00:26:12,153
Caught.

372
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:17,168
Send me to the brig.
I can run there.

373
00:26:18,266 --> 00:26:21,850
Cottle says you're experiencing
a moment of euphoria

374
00:26:21,975 --> 00:26:25,307
as your body recovers
from the toxicity of the treatments.

375
00:26:25,616 --> 00:26:29,111
So much
for Doctor-patient confidentiality.

376
00:26:29,817 --> 00:26:32,773
Well, the President's health
is a security issue.

377
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,691
My resignation
will be on your desk in the hour.

378
00:26:38,112 --> 00:26:41,232
I'm not gonna hand
the presidency over to Tom Zarek.

379
00:26:42,097 --> 00:26:45,144
- Then the status quo will have to do.
- Stop it.

380
00:26:45,768 --> 00:26:47,348
Listen, we need you.

381
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:50,751
Zarek's got the Quorum in an uproar.

382
00:26:51,053 --> 00:26:52,754
The press is going crazy.

383
00:26:53,227 --> 00:26:54,455
The government

384
00:26:54,917 --> 00:26:56,645
is spinning out of control.

385
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:57,782
Now...

386
00:26:58,242 --> 00:26:59,362
we need you.

387
00:27:01,768 --> 00:27:03,785
Take your hands off me, Bill.

388
00:27:04,978 --> 00:27:07,777
I've played my role in this farce.

389
00:27:08,902 --> 00:27:11,687
"A dying leader
will guide the people to the...

390
00:27:12,002 --> 00:27:14,334
"blah-blah-blah frakkin...

391
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:16,818
"blah-blah."

392
00:27:17,634 --> 00:27:20,091
I've been there. I've done that.
Now what?

393
00:27:20,693 --> 00:27:23,396
Is there another role
that I have to play

394
00:27:23,521 --> 00:27:25,069
for the rest of my life?

395
00:27:29,283 --> 00:27:31,891
Do you remember
what we said on new Caprica?

396
00:27:32,865 --> 00:27:35,581
How we talked about trying
to live for today?

397
00:27:37,775 --> 00:27:40,418
Well, you better think about that,
because...

398
00:27:41,004 --> 00:27:43,326
maybe tomorrow really isn't coming.

399
00:27:43,993 --> 00:27:46,091
Maybe today is all we have left.

400
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:47,689
And maybe...

401
00:27:50,306 --> 00:27:51,478
Just maybe...

402
00:27:52,499 --> 00:27:53,618
I've earned

403
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:56,446
the right to live a little
before I die.

404
00:27:58,849 --> 00:27:59,929
Haven't I?

405
00:28:01,088 --> 00:28:02,455
What do you think?

406
00:28:04,146 --> 00:28:05,149
Haven't I?

407
00:28:08,585 --> 00:28:10,154
Yes, you've earned it.

408
00:28:11,086 --> 00:28:12,085
I have.

409
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:13,980
Well, guess what.

410
00:28:15,099 --> 00:28:16,158
So have you.

411
00:28:21,216 --> 00:28:22,763
Now get out of my way.

412
00:28:27,544 --> 00:28:30,007
What manner of forgiveness

413
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,929
are you seeking?

414
00:28:34,641 --> 00:28:36,970
Is it that of disobedient children?

415
00:28:37,893 --> 00:28:39,212
Are you children?

416
00:28:40,189 --> 00:28:42,085
Well, obviously you're a child.

417
00:28:42,531 --> 00:28:45,391
We have some children here,
but to the rest of you,

418
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:47,048
in your mind's eye,

419
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:51,838
are you all just children
who've transgressed

420
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:54,351
- against your father's divine will?
- No.

421
00:28:54,476 --> 00:28:56,024
We've done nothing wrong.

422
00:29:00,517 --> 00:29:03,362
Are you being punished
for your multitude of sins?

423
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,134
- Are you?
- No.

424
00:29:09,644 --> 00:29:11,380
Is this really our lot?

425
00:29:13,234 --> 00:29:14,683
To have been led...

426
00:29:16,609 --> 00:29:17,809
by a father...

427
00:29:19,773 --> 00:29:21,323
to the promised land.

428
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:25,143
No. We shouldn't have to suffer.

429
00:29:26,458 --> 00:29:28,893
- Just keep talking.
- To paradise...

430
00:29:31,445 --> 00:29:33,354
Only to have paradise

431
00:29:33,925 --> 00:29:36,518
cruelly smashed
to bits before our very eyes?

432
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,694
Are these the actions of a father

433
00:29:41,936 --> 00:29:44,156
- towards his children?
- No.

434
00:29:44,961 --> 00:29:46,158
It's not right.

435
00:29:49,023 --> 00:29:50,489
What have you done?

436
00:29:51,399 --> 00:29:54,382
What have you done
to deserve this punishment?

437
00:29:56,312 --> 00:29:58,291
What sins have you committed?

438
00:29:59,186 --> 00:30:03,092
<i>What dark thoughts have you harbored
that condemn you?</i>

439
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,466
Condemn you...

440
00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:07,304
to wander through the universe

441
00:30:07,879 --> 00:30:09,080
without hope?

442
00:30:10,389 --> 00:30:11,596
Without light?

443
00:30:12,846 --> 00:30:15,934
So you have to ask yourself
what kind of a father

444
00:30:16,059 --> 00:30:19,942
abandons his own children
to despair and loneliness?

445
00:30:20,067 --> 00:30:21,084
No father!

446
00:30:21,209 --> 00:30:23,593
Perhaps we are not
the ones in need of forgiveness.

447
00:30:23,898 --> 00:30:26,198
Perhaps we're not.
Perhaps we have been wronged!

448
00:30:26,632 --> 00:30:27,947
Yes, we have!

449
00:30:28,208 --> 00:30:29,656
Perhaps it is God

450
00:30:29,879 --> 00:30:33,031
who should come down here
and beg for our forgiveness?

451
00:30:33,353 --> 00:30:34,486
Am I right?

452
00:30:34,611 --> 00:30:35,730
Am I right?

453
00:30:35,982 --> 00:30:37,455
Well, shout it to God!

454
00:30:39,362 --> 00:30:41,008
What have you done for me lately?

455
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,336
Where have you been?

456
00:30:44,114 --> 00:30:46,583
There is a disease aboard this ship,

457
00:30:47,493 --> 00:30:49,733
and it is a disease of denial!

458
00:30:51,386 --> 00:30:53,712
Am I right? Well, don't tell me!

459
00:30:54,246 --> 00:30:55,540
Shout it to God!

460
00:31:01,535 --> 00:31:03,574
Cottle told me. I didn't know.

461
00:31:04,046 --> 00:31:06,153
We need to... We should talk.

462
00:31:24,429 --> 00:31:25,534
Get off me!

463
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:45,152
It's a godsdamn uprising.

464
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:48,634
I don't think we're there yet,
but we do have a problem.

465
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:52,409
A problem? Ten of our ships refuse
a direct order from the flagship.

466
00:31:52,534 --> 00:31:56,477
- Another 12 won't respond to our hails.
- They're not doing anything illegal.

467
00:31:56,602 --> 00:32:00,465
The Quorum gave them the right to refuse
any Cylon or Cylon technology aboard.

468
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:03,082
Jump drive upgrades
is a military decision

469
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:05,381
outside of the authority
of the Quorum.

470
00:32:06,313 --> 00:32:08,384
And you alone get to make
that determination?

471
00:32:12,435 --> 00:32:13,884
Yes, Mr. Gaeta.

472
00:32:14,255 --> 00:32:16,503
I get to make that determination.

473
00:32:16,812 --> 00:32:18,323
You have a problem with that?

474
00:32:18,448 --> 00:32:21,035
Admiral, we're in receipt
of an emergency signal

475
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,230
from our marine commander
aboard the Hitei Kan.

476
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,402
The crew of the tylium ship
has mutinied.

477
00:32:27,131 --> 00:32:29,301
They killed a Cylon and two marines.

478
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,637
Scramble the mardet alert team

479
00:32:33,762 --> 00:32:35,657
and launch the assault Raptor.

480
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:39,762
<i>This is the XO.
Scramble the mardet alert team.</i>

481
00:32:39,966 --> 00:32:41,500
<i>Mutiny aboard Hitei Kan.</i>

482
00:32:41,714 --> 00:32:44,123
Admiral, tylium ship
is pulling out of formation,

483
00:32:44,248 --> 00:32:46,046
spinning up their FTL drives.

484
00:32:50,929 --> 00:32:53,793
I want to talk to whoever's
in charge of that ship right now.

485
00:32:53,918 --> 00:32:55,139
Hitei Kan,

486
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:56,969
this is Galactica. Please respond.

487
00:32:57,094 --> 00:33:00,189
This is a priority signal
from Galactica actual to the...

488
00:33:00,741 --> 00:33:02,656
current commander of your ship.

489
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:05,480
Their drives are spooled up.

490
00:33:06,028 --> 00:33:08,319
- Where's my assault team?
- Raptor's launching now.

491
00:33:12,263 --> 00:33:13,365
<i>Galactica, Athena.</i>

492
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:16,209
We've cleared the bay
and are <i>en route</i> to Hitei Kan.

493
00:33:22,263 --> 00:33:25,147
<i>Hitei Kan, this is Galactica.
Please respond.</i>

494
00:33:25,852 --> 00:33:28,213
- Mr. Hoshi!
- I'm trying, but they're not...

495
00:33:29,002 --> 00:33:29,886
Wait.

496
00:33:31,178 --> 00:33:32,926
They're communicating
with Colonial One.

497
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:34,758
Roslin?

498
00:33:34,883 --> 00:33:37,389
Can't be. She's aboard Galactica.
Let's hear it.

499
00:33:39,661 --> 00:33:40,688
<i>The dradis!</i>

500
00:33:40,813 --> 00:33:43,643
<i>The dradis shows a Raptor
and Vipers heading straight for us.</i>

501
00:33:43,768 --> 00:33:46,420
<i>- They'll be here any minute.
- They have no right to board your ship</i>

502
00:33:46,545 --> 00:33:48,112
<i>without your permission.</i>

503
00:33:48,237 --> 00:33:50,032
Son of a bitch.

504
00:33:50,882 --> 00:33:52,971
<i>What should we do,
Mr. Vice President?</i>

505
00:33:53,096 --> 00:33:56,590
<i>Every citizen has the right
to protect themselves from oppression.</i>

506
00:33:56,715 --> 00:33:58,938
<i>Take whatever measures
you think necessary.</i>

507
00:34:26,375 --> 00:34:27,562
She jumped.

508
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:29,650
Hitei Kan has jumped away, sir.

509
00:34:29,775 --> 00:34:31,544
Taking all our fuel with them.

510
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:35,882
You know, there are days
that I really hate this job.

511
00:34:39,963 --> 00:34:41,286
Put me on scramble.

512
00:34:43,508 --> 00:34:44,481
Athena.

513
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:46,875
Galactica actual.

514
00:34:48,256 --> 00:34:49,425
I read you, actual.

515
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:51,890
<i>You're ordered to board
the Colonial One.</i>

516
00:34:52,015 --> 00:34:54,550
<i>Locate and arrest
the Vice President,</i>

517
00:34:54,996 --> 00:34:56,719
then bring him back to Galactica.

518
00:34:57,514 --> 00:34:59,871
Roger that, actual.
Arrest and return to Galactica.

519
00:34:59,996 --> 00:35:01,515
What are my orders if he resists?

520
00:35:02,826 --> 00:35:04,103
In that case,

521
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:08,981
<i>the use of deadly force
is authorized.</i>

522
00:35:21,312 --> 00:35:23,642
I don't know anything
about being a father.

523
00:35:26,353 --> 00:35:27,425
It sucks.

524
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:32,087
Except for the parts that don't.

525
00:35:39,799 --> 00:35:40,850
All right.

526
00:35:42,124 --> 00:35:43,942
First lesson in parenting.

527
00:35:47,097 --> 00:35:47,957
Sit.

528
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:54,696
Your kid's in the hospital,

529
00:35:54,821 --> 00:35:57,362
you never leave him alone,
no matter what.

530
00:35:57,927 --> 00:35:59,445
Someone's always here.

531
00:36:01,231 --> 00:36:02,713
You get first shift...

532
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:03,980
Dad.

533
00:36:06,292 --> 00:36:07,185
Wait.

534
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,168
How long do I sit here?

535
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:13,069
Until I get back.

536
00:36:14,141 --> 00:36:15,900
That'll be after I sober up.

537
00:36:30,708 --> 00:36:32,127
Sworn statements.

538
00:36:32,252 --> 00:36:35,108
Transcripts of wireless conversations.
Shipping records.

539
00:36:36,217 --> 00:36:38,904
All kinds of documents really.

540
00:36:39,922 --> 00:36:41,753
Compiled over the last year

541
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,726
with one theme.

542
00:36:44,905 --> 00:36:46,601
The buying and the selling

543
00:36:48,056 --> 00:36:50,092
of the Vice President's office.

544
00:36:52,029 --> 00:36:53,271
So this is a...

545
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,628
conversation about extortion.

546
00:36:58,664 --> 00:37:01,802
About law and order.
But you can call it what you want.

547
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,450
You see, I believe that...

548
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,012
you would walk happily
to the gallows

549
00:37:07,914 --> 00:37:10,977
or languish in a cell
for the rest of your life,

550
00:37:11,887 --> 00:37:13,468
if you could do it as a...

551
00:37:13,959 --> 00:37:15,575
martyr to your cause.

552
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,565
But the idea of being...

553
00:37:21,511 --> 00:37:23,278
publicly humiliated,

554
00:37:24,574 --> 00:37:27,369
as a corrupt politician
with your hand in the till.

555
00:37:28,095 --> 00:37:29,774
Well, that would scare you.

556
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:34,809
Somehow I don't think
that the legend and the myth

557
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,713
of Tom Zarek, the political prisoner

558
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:39,702
and a man of conscience,

559
00:37:40,612 --> 00:37:43,799
can survive the airing
of that much dirty laundry.

560
00:37:45,996 --> 00:37:48,531
You really think the fleet
is going to sit still

561
00:37:48,969 --> 00:37:51,935
for a long
and politically motivated trial

562
00:37:52,862 --> 00:37:55,290
while you make an alliance
with the Cylons?

563
00:37:55,665 --> 00:37:59,076
I think without the tylium ship,
we're not going anywhere.

564
00:38:00,433 --> 00:38:02,613
We're gonna sit here
for a long time.

565
00:38:05,763 --> 00:38:07,618
At least we won't be bored.

566
00:38:10,067 --> 00:38:12,638
You think I know
where the tylium ship is?

567
00:38:12,879 --> 00:38:14,544
- Yes, I do.
- Why?

568
00:38:16,924 --> 00:38:18,915
Because I know that you do.

569
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:22,410
Read the file.

570
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,093
Some juicy stuff.

571
00:38:26,777 --> 00:38:29,089
Make a great story for the press.

572
00:38:29,741 --> 00:38:32,330
Murder and extortion.

573
00:38:37,009 --> 00:38:40,214
You know what the difference is
between you and I, Admiral?

574
00:38:43,348 --> 00:38:44,982
You wear that uniform

575
00:38:46,839 --> 00:38:48,098
and I don't.

576
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:17,589
You can cool your heels here
until I check these out.

577
00:39:19,598 --> 00:39:21,303
I wouldn't eat the food.

578
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:38,660
- Here's our tylium ship.
- That was fast. How did you do it?

579
00:39:38,785 --> 00:39:40,685
I appealed to his intellect.

580
00:39:41,843 --> 00:39:44,481
- Should I send in a medic?
- No, he's fine.

581
00:39:45,128 --> 00:39:48,135
You're not. You should see a medic.
You look like hell.

582
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:50,461
I feel like it too. I need to rest.

583
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:52,185
You earned it.

584
00:39:52,506 --> 00:39:55,113
Let me know when they find the ship.
I'll be with the President.

585
00:39:55,238 --> 00:39:56,443
You got it.

586
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,772
Give this to Hoshi.
Tell him to file it.

587
00:40:06,718 --> 00:40:08,155
Laundry reports?

588
00:40:16,343 --> 00:40:18,123
<i>Hitei Kan, this is Athena.</i>

589
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:20,263
Stand by to be boarded.

590
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:24,414
Any resistance will be met with force.
This is your only warning.

591
00:40:26,881 --> 00:40:28,015
<i>Understood.</i>

592
00:40:34,277 --> 00:40:35,670
Every revolution

593
00:40:36,714 --> 00:40:38,696
begins with one small act

594
00:40:39,018 --> 00:40:40,107
of courage.

595
00:40:41,741 --> 00:40:44,071
But I hope you know
how serious this is.

596
00:40:44,571 --> 00:40:47,053
I hope you understand that this

597
00:40:47,312 --> 00:40:48,839
will have consequences.

598
00:40:49,339 --> 00:40:51,410
Deadly consequences.

599
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:54,348
For a lot of people.

600
00:40:57,205 --> 00:40:58,874
I've thought about the consequences.

601
00:40:59,772 --> 00:41:00,624
I'm ready.

602
00:41:01,513 --> 00:41:02,417
We all are.

603
00:41:04,022 --> 00:41:05,253
How many is "we"?

604
00:41:06,575 --> 00:41:07,522
Enough.

605
00:41:10,075 --> 00:41:12,236
But once it starts,
we'll get more support.

606
00:41:12,888 --> 00:41:15,102
People know
something has to be done.

607
00:41:15,941 --> 00:41:18,387
The world is frakked.
It's upside-down.

608
00:41:18,512 --> 00:41:20,727
And somebody's
gotta turn it right-side up.

609
00:41:22,807 --> 00:41:23,980
Are you that man?

610
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,152
I'm one of them.

611
00:41:29,485 --> 00:41:30,485
I need...

612
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,423
a partner.

613
00:41:42,751 --> 00:41:43,709
You've got one.

614
00:42:05,437 --> 00:42:07,753
That's good.
Take it from here, Saul.

615
00:42:08,327 --> 00:42:09,854
See you in the morning.

616
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:17,774
They found the tylium ship.

617
00:42:24,194 --> 00:42:25,413
Do you care?

618
00:42:31,926 --> 00:42:33,212
Neither do I.

619
00:42:35,377 --> 00:42:36,582
Good night.
