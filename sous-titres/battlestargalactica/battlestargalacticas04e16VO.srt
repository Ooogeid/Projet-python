2
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:03,218
I started thinking
about damages you can't see.

3
00:00:03,343 --> 00:00:05,531
Hairline fractures in all the beams.

4
00:00:05,656 --> 00:00:07,756
It's throughout the entire ship.

5
00:00:08,095 --> 00:00:09,425
It's our baby, Saul.

6
00:00:09,594 --> 00:00:11,886
We'd come to believe
that a lack of God's love

7
00:00:12,054 --> 00:00:14,639
is what prevented us
from biological reproduction.

8
00:00:15,343 --> 00:00:17,094
And our love produced a child.

9
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:20,232
- Let him go now. Take him now.
- Saul, stay with the fleet.

10
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:22,688
It's all starting to happen,
it's the miracle right here.

11
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,065
Stay with the fleet!

12
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,290
Ellen, you're the Fifth.

13
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:37,356
- What are you doing?
- Forgiving you.

14
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:06,023
- Is this gonna work?
- I have no idea, sir.

15
00:01:08,032 --> 00:01:09,432
This is the stuff?

16
00:01:09,843 --> 00:01:10,843
Yeah.

17
00:01:12,797 --> 00:01:14,597
- Can I touch it?
- Yeah.

18
00:01:15,406 --> 00:01:16,325
It's gooey.

19
00:01:16,851 --> 00:01:19,655
But it... hardens.
Becomes like cartilage.

20
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,130
It's flexible, strong.
It's what the baseship's made of.

21
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,480
Is this alive?

22
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:29,906
Heads up.

23
00:01:32,237 --> 00:01:34,719
Heads up, marines.
Stay back.

24
00:01:42,442 --> 00:01:44,395
Stay back and everyone
will get their share!

25
00:01:46,001 --> 00:01:46,856
Stay back!

26
00:01:47,222 --> 00:01:48,615
Everyone'll get their share.

27
00:01:49,654 --> 00:01:50,654
Hey, Cylon.

28
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,281
- I don't want any trouble.
- Well, you got trouble.

29
00:02:17,694 --> 00:02:18,929
This better work.

30
00:02:28,656 --> 00:02:30,649
Kid's got a heart
like a kettle drum.

31
00:02:30,844 --> 00:02:33,886
Go on, get out of here.
Make room for some sick people.

32
00:02:36,592 --> 00:02:40,534
You should stay here for the night.
I don't trust that machine.

33
00:02:42,281 --> 00:02:43,245
I know.

34
00:02:43,414 --> 00:02:45,214
The irony is irresistible.

35
00:02:47,132 --> 00:02:48,432
The baby's fine.

36
00:02:48,676 --> 00:02:49,826
Liam is fine.

37
00:02:51,116 --> 00:02:52,880
You know I'd sleep better at home
with you.

38
00:02:57,923 --> 00:02:58,738
Sitrep.

39
00:02:58,863 --> 00:03:00,990
Sir, we're picking up
a bogey on dradis.

40
00:03:01,115 --> 00:03:04,265
Raptor. Squawks colonial,
but it's not on the roster.

41
00:03:05,053 --> 00:03:08,521
It's one of ours, but we logged it
as lost over a year ago, sir.

42
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:15,240
<i>Galactica, permission to board.</i>

43
00:03:15,365 --> 00:03:17,790
Raptor 702,
your transmission's all garbled.

44
00:03:17,915 --> 00:03:19,907
If you can hear me, give me a flash.

45
00:03:21,513 --> 00:03:23,452
Copy, 702. Galactica,

46
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,966
<i>they're receiving.</i>

47
00:03:25,616 --> 00:03:28,207
Red leader, Red Turkey, the voice.
I think that's an Eight.

48
00:03:28,803 --> 00:03:30,603
Starbuck, Galactica actual.

49
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:32,927
- <i>Report.</i>
- Galactica, Red leader.

50
00:03:33,052 --> 00:03:36,352
Our heavy raider buddy's
calling the inbound a "Sharon".

51
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:37,989
An Eight.

52
00:03:42,241 --> 00:03:43,514
Starbuck, bring it in.

53
00:03:43,816 --> 00:03:44,682
<i>Copy that.</i>

54
00:04:21,413 --> 00:04:22,678
My Gods.

55
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:24,179
It's Ellen Tigh.

56
00:04:24,617 --> 00:04:25,472
Bill.

57
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,766
How many dead chicks are out there?

58
00:04:32,158 --> 00:04:34,106
I can't tell you
how happy I am to see you.

59
00:04:35,114 --> 00:04:37,818
Aren't you gonna help a lady
down off this thing?

60
00:04:44,276 --> 00:04:45,969
Nice to see you again.

61
00:04:47,426 --> 00:04:48,454
This is Boomer.

62
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:52,239
Marines.

63
00:04:52,551 --> 00:04:54,801
Take this number Eight to the brig.

He wants us

68
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:09,478
to rebuild it.

69
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:11,328
I really think Cavil's

70
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,455
completely unbalanced.

71
00:06:13,728 --> 00:06:16,841
It's too much for him,
the thought that the...

72
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:21,241
The only hope for the Cylon people
is this desperate grab

73
00:06:21,366 --> 00:06:23,757
for procreation, evolution,

74
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,343
all that messy biological
trial and error.

75
00:06:28,165 --> 00:06:29,165
Dear.

76
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,849
I'm totally throwing you, aren't I?

77
00:06:32,414 --> 00:06:34,214
I'm still Ellen, you know.

78
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,817
Does anyone have something to drink?

79
00:06:42,414 --> 00:06:44,030
Maybe a flask?

80
00:06:53,093 --> 00:06:55,039
So Boomer helped you escape.

81
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:58,049
Yes. I hope
you won't treat her too badly.

82
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,085
You don't need
to worry about Boomer.

83
00:07:05,798 --> 00:07:07,048
May I see them?

84
00:07:07,796 --> 00:07:08,796
The others?

85
00:07:09,421 --> 00:07:11,406
Galen, Tory, and Sam?

86
00:07:13,597 --> 00:07:14,433
Imagine,

87
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,003
Bill, Laura, imagine...

88
00:07:17,951 --> 00:07:18,937
instead of...

89
00:07:19,446 --> 00:07:22,066
50,000 survivors,

90
00:07:22,505 --> 00:07:23,676
there are only five.

91
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,020
Five people.

92
00:07:29,046 --> 00:07:30,896
Imagine how close you'd be.

93
00:07:31,172 --> 00:07:33,472
And then to have all that torn away.

94
00:07:35,236 --> 00:07:36,836
It's all right, Ellen.

95
00:07:37,421 --> 00:07:38,582
It's over now.

96
00:07:40,734 --> 00:07:42,484
How much do you remember?

97
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,757
Not much from before.

98
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,170
Flashes.

99
00:07:48,924 --> 00:07:51,024
Samuel Anders was badly injured.

100
00:07:51,421 --> 00:07:52,921
He's not responding.

101
00:07:53,758 --> 00:07:55,140
- My God.
- He's not dead.

102
00:07:55,796 --> 00:07:58,146
- There's hope.
- I want to see him.

103
00:07:58,608 --> 00:08:00,758
I want to see him and the others.

104
00:08:08,608 --> 00:08:10,030
We'll see what we can do.

105
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:24,253
I can't believe

106
00:08:24,767 --> 00:08:25,867
you're here.

107
00:08:30,612 --> 00:08:33,196
There is so much I have to ask you.

108
00:08:34,048 --> 00:08:35,198
There's so...

109
00:08:35,886 --> 00:08:37,434
I have to tell you.

110
00:08:38,174 --> 00:08:39,924
You'd better say it fast.

111
00:08:40,485 --> 00:08:41,585
Ellen, wait.

112
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,861
- Floor or table?
- I don't care.

113
00:09:55,772 --> 00:09:56,595
Gaius!

114
00:09:58,149 --> 00:09:59,194
Jeanne.

115
00:09:59,319 --> 00:10:02,369
- Welcome back.
- I missed you. Let me look at you.

116
00:10:04,722 --> 00:10:05,722
Paulla.

117
00:10:10,096 --> 00:10:12,696
We were wondering
if you were coming back.

118
00:10:16,952 --> 00:10:17,952
If?

119
00:10:19,848 --> 00:10:21,620
Of course I was coming back!

120
00:10:22,178 --> 00:10:23,080
Course I was.

121
00:10:24,471 --> 00:10:25,471
So.

122
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:27,802
What did I miss?

123
00:10:28,866 --> 00:10:30,671
What's been going on?

124
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,509
Well, it got pretty bad
after you left, Gaius.

125
00:10:36,381 --> 00:10:40,222
They'd bring us supplies and men
would come and take them away by force.

126
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,511
It was...

127
00:10:44,207 --> 00:10:46,510
We were very tired, Gaius.

128
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,647
We realized we'd been abandoned

129
00:10:49,478 --> 00:10:51,249
and we had
to take care of ourselves.

130
00:10:54,706 --> 00:10:55,706
Abandoned?

131
00:10:56,394 --> 00:10:58,208
I... How could you...

132
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:01,883
- I wouldn't say that. I wouldn't say...
- Abandoned by God.

133
00:11:03,369 --> 00:11:05,469
That I might. I might say that.

134
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:10,210
There were dead men in the halls
with guns in their hands.

135
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,620
So we took their guns.

136
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:16,930
Now we can protect our food
and we can protect ourselves.

137
00:11:17,206 --> 00:11:18,406
All of this...

138
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:20,494
All of this is food, Gaius.

139
00:11:20,956 --> 00:11:23,206
We're taking care of ourselves now.

140
00:11:23,896 --> 00:11:27,096
I knew if I stayed away
that you'd find the strength.

141
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:28,920
And you have.

142
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:33,220
It's one of the reasons
why I stayed away as long as I did.

143
00:11:33,584 --> 00:11:35,484
That was wise of you, Gaius.

144
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,608
Sheep have a new shepherd, Gaius.

145
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,251
That's what I call a big welcome.
Very impressive.

146
00:11:55,489 --> 00:11:56,798
So who'd you frak?

147
00:11:57,772 --> 00:11:58,772
What?

148
00:11:58,958 --> 00:11:59,958
Come on.

149
00:12:00,582 --> 00:12:04,586
You don't think I know your repertoire
after thousands of years of marriage?

150
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,677
It's okay. I'm not mad.

151
00:12:09,845 --> 00:12:11,617
You thought I was dead.

152
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,808
- Ellen.
- Who was it?

153
00:12:15,049 --> 00:12:16,649
Well, if you really...

154
00:12:21,994 --> 00:12:23,144
It was a Six.

155
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:25,844
Caprica-Six.

156
00:12:29,932 --> 00:12:31,307
We made Sixes.

157
00:12:31,474 --> 00:12:34,520
- We created her. That's just...
- I thought of you.

158
00:12:35,556 --> 00:12:36,556
Always.

159
00:12:37,183 --> 00:12:39,216
- I thought of you.
- What do you mean? When you...

160
00:12:41,252 --> 00:12:45,382
Please do not tell me
I was your mental porn.

161
00:12:45,507 --> 00:12:46,807
That's just sad.

162
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:52,362
- Well, are you still seeing her?
- Yes.

163
00:13:24,092 --> 00:13:25,392
Lot of visitors.

164
00:13:26,859 --> 00:13:29,203
Just don't anybody unplug anything.

165
00:13:39,237 --> 00:13:40,317
Oh, my.

166
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,171
I never thought I would see this.

167
00:13:42,296 --> 00:13:43,238
Yes,

168
00:13:43,504 --> 00:13:44,954
this is how it was.

169
00:13:48,107 --> 00:13:49,107
Tory.

170
00:13:54,171 --> 00:13:55,171
Galen.

171
00:13:59,733 --> 00:14:01,033
All those years.

172
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:09,008
The poor boy.

173
00:14:10,108 --> 00:14:11,408
Such bad timing.

174
00:14:18,955 --> 00:14:20,455
We've been thinking.

175
00:14:21,487 --> 00:14:22,937
We belong together.

176
00:14:23,907 --> 00:14:25,280
Join us on the baseship.

177
00:14:25,515 --> 00:14:27,782
We'll jump away. Start a new life.

178
00:14:28,518 --> 00:14:30,160
Please consider the offer.

179
00:14:30,481 --> 00:14:32,245
It would mean so much to us.

180
00:14:33,144 --> 00:14:35,506
Abandon the fleet.
This is your offer?

181
00:14:36,413 --> 00:14:39,163
The priority of the fleet
is the survival...

182
00:14:40,081 --> 00:14:41,731
The survival of humans.

183
00:14:42,144 --> 00:14:43,920
We're not safe in this fleet.

184
00:14:44,332 --> 00:14:46,927
- Even today a Cylon was assaulted.
- I agree.

185
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:50,076
This is about the survival
of the original 13th tribe

186
00:14:50,201 --> 00:14:51,348
in its purest form.

187
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,600
Did you put this idea
in their heads?

188
00:14:53,966 --> 00:14:55,560
It won't work, of course.

189
00:14:55,767 --> 00:14:58,917
The child, Hera, is the hope
for a new blended future.

190
00:14:59,042 --> 00:15:01,939
That used to be true.
But now there's another way.

191
00:15:02,546 --> 00:15:05,418
Caprica-Six's unborn baby
is pure Cylon.

192
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:08,874
We can rebuild
a pure Cylon civilization.

193
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:11,182
Even if we don't find
a planet to colonize,

194
00:15:11,307 --> 00:15:13,663
we can live indefinitely
on the baseship.

195
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:15,080
Look at him.

196
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,228
He'd die over there.

197
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:20,508
We can take care of him
better than here.

198
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,796
The Cylon family can survive.

199
00:15:23,834 --> 00:15:25,234
We can start over.

200
00:15:26,282 --> 00:15:27,532
Caprica-Six

201
00:15:28,814 --> 00:15:29,967
is pregnant?

202
00:15:34,248 --> 00:15:36,678
- You got her pregnant?
- I... I did. Yeah.

203
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:38,022
I didn't know.

204
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:41,773
- I was surprised.
- It was a great surprise to all of us.

205
00:15:42,085 --> 00:15:43,649
The mating of an original Cylon.

206
00:15:44,369 --> 00:15:46,196
You are our children.

207
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,564
Can we talk about the offer,
maybe deal with the baby later?

208
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:52,033
Are we going or...?

209
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:53,336
Of course not.

210
00:15:53,939 --> 00:15:56,792
Anders specifically said
"Do not abandon the fleet."

211
00:15:56,917 --> 00:15:59,291
- So you love her then.
- Last thing he ever said.

212
00:16:00,007 --> 00:16:01,459
He's not saying anything now.

213
00:16:02,119 --> 00:16:04,467
I'm going with the baseship.
Even after you knew...

214
00:16:04,592 --> 00:16:06,960
- For frak's sake.
- You made us all filthy in this.

215
00:16:07,085 --> 00:16:09,103
You just can't stop poisoning me.

216
00:16:09,595 --> 00:16:12,721
Poison more and more of it
until I'm swimming in it!

217
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:15,155
- Stop this.
- I'm staying on Galactica. You hear me?

218
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,774
- You can go if you're so mad.
- Wait.

219
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,768
We won't leave
with just one or two of the Five.

220
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,607
It has to be all of you
or none of you.

221
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:26,443
So you need to vote
and the outcome will bind all of you.

222
00:16:26,776 --> 00:16:29,112
Majority rule.
It's what Cylons do.

223
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,822
It's a legacy from you.

224
00:16:31,276 --> 00:16:32,824
Fine. So it's a vote?

225
00:16:33,156 --> 00:16:35,083
All right. I vote we go.

226
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,101
Great. That's me and you.

227
00:16:38,984 --> 00:16:40,832
We don't really know
what Anders would vote.

228
00:16:41,162 --> 00:16:42,876
Yeah, we do. He said he'd stay.

229
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:46,003
All those years
we tried to have children

230
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:47,463
and we never could.

231
00:16:47,588 --> 00:16:49,716
You must've been laughing
your shiny, shiny head off.

232
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,052
It was impossible.

233
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,675
You didn't love me.

234
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,582
So what are you saying?

235
00:16:56,153 --> 00:16:58,116
Do you vote to stay or to go?

236
00:17:06,904 --> 00:17:08,485
I haven't decided yet.

237
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,467
Two to go. Two to stay.

238
00:17:15,592 --> 00:17:18,083
And the swing vote
is walking out the door.

239
00:17:22,706 --> 00:17:24,615
We come to Dogsville more often now.

240
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:29,507
We don't feel the need to cut ourselves
off from the rest of the world.

241
00:17:29,828 --> 00:17:32,425
We trade here. Sometimes,
we sell the jewelry that we made.

242
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,881
That's how we got so much food.

243
00:17:35,259 --> 00:17:36,468
Yes, Jeanne.

244
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:40,656
Since you've been gone,
we've been trying to focus on life.

245
00:17:40,781 --> 00:17:42,000
Gaius, come on.

246
00:17:50,816 --> 00:17:51,816
Hello.

247
00:17:52,968 --> 00:17:54,318
What's your name?

248
00:17:54,781 --> 00:17:55,781
Naia.

249
00:17:56,104 --> 00:17:57,104
Naia.

250
00:17:57,408 --> 00:17:59,160
That's a very beautiful name.

251
00:18:01,263 --> 00:18:02,322
And who's this?

252
00:18:02,447 --> 00:18:03,463
Stand up.

253
00:18:03,588 --> 00:18:04,589
Stand up.

254
00:18:05,604 --> 00:18:06,718
This is Gaius.

255
00:18:09,981 --> 00:18:12,012
Really? I'm very flattered...

256
00:18:12,137 --> 00:18:13,573
It was his father's name.

257
00:18:13,698 --> 00:18:15,779
To have the same name as his father.

258
00:18:16,214 --> 00:18:17,470
It's very...

259
00:18:21,377 --> 00:18:22,308
Are you hungry?

260
00:18:22,988 --> 00:18:24,352
You look a bit hungry.

261
00:18:25,325 --> 00:18:26,229
He's hungry?

262
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,773
- They're all hungry.
- Are they?

263
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,935
Paulla, we've got some food,
haven't we?

264
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,110
To share with this lot of people?

265
00:18:35,378 --> 00:18:37,948
We're gonna need it eventually
to eat, to trade.

266
00:18:38,286 --> 00:18:39,200
We can't.

267
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:42,504
Really, Paulla.

268
00:18:43,662 --> 00:18:45,859
Are we going to enjoy this food

269
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:48,126
with children starving?

270
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:50,327
Now ask yourself
this question really.

271
00:18:50,768 --> 00:18:53,622
Look aroun, look at these childr...
It's not just this child here.

272
00:18:53,905 --> 00:18:54,905
This...

273
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:56,849
Little Gaius.

274
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,590
But he is very cute, this one.

275
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:03,537
It's all the children, isn't it?
All of them.

276
00:19:03,662 --> 00:19:06,182
And you're putting the food...
Listen to me!

277
00:19:07,014 --> 00:19:08,186
Listen to me!

278
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:10,732
I'm coming back here.

279
00:19:11,057 --> 00:19:13,022
And if it is the last thing I do,

280
00:19:13,438 --> 00:19:16,838
I will ensure
that every single one of you are fed

281
00:19:17,316 --> 00:19:19,098
and your children are fed,

282
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:21,283
as God is my witness!

283
00:19:33,726 --> 00:19:34,726
Caprica.

284
00:19:36,589 --> 00:19:39,979
That's funny. I don't think
I've ever called you a name before.

285
00:19:41,302 --> 00:19:43,645
I think you probably called me
some names.

286
00:19:44,946 --> 00:19:46,295
I haven't had the chan...

287
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:50,388
No, I haven't taken the opportunity
to congratulate you and the baby.

288
00:19:51,102 --> 00:19:55,067
I just wondered if everything
was all right with Ellen being back.

289
00:19:56,152 --> 00:19:58,760
I heard about the assault
in Dogsville.

290
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:02,491
And on behalf of the fleet,
I wanted to apologize to you.

291
00:20:03,216 --> 00:20:04,292
Thank you.

292
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:06,277
It's very kind of you.

293
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:09,832
Caprica, sometimes
I think about the visions

294
00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:12,109
that we shared and the talk...

295
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:14,012
we had.

296
00:20:18,052 --> 00:20:20,352
I haven't had one in a while.
Have you?

297
00:20:22,043 --> 00:20:23,846
Not the whole time
I've been pregnant.

298
00:20:24,251 --> 00:20:25,918
That never occurred to me.

299
00:20:26,418 --> 00:20:28,387
Are you saying that this ch...

300
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:30,605
What?

301
00:20:32,008 --> 00:20:34,162
Is this child important?

302
00:20:34,944 --> 00:20:37,007
Yes, I think he's very important.

303
00:20:38,472 --> 00:20:41,155
He's my baby and I love him.
He's very important to me.

304
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:42,593
Of course he is.

305
00:20:43,171 --> 00:20:46,199
Of course, all children are important.
Yes. Indeed.

306
00:20:48,139 --> 00:20:50,104
Thank you for asking about him.

307
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:51,959
You're welcome.

308
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,381
When'd you get a piano?

309
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,259
Gin.

310
00:21:04,256 --> 00:21:06,681
You see Ellen and Tigh
on the wing of that bird?

311
00:21:07,478 --> 00:21:09,838
It's like watching
my parents make out.

312
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,442
You go see Boomer in the brig yet?

313
00:21:19,841 --> 00:21:20,844
No.

314
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:24,030
You should go when she's asleep.

315
00:21:24,155 --> 00:21:27,527
I watched Sam until I just
couldn't handle the fun anymore.

316
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,023
There you are.

317
00:21:59,755 --> 00:22:01,019
Look at you.

318
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,849
You haven't changed much.

319
00:22:14,683 --> 00:22:17,531
How did you get the guards
to bring you here?

320
00:22:25,656 --> 00:22:29,097
I thought maybe we could have a drink.
Where's the booze?

321
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:31,683
- I have tea.
- God no.

322
00:22:35,574 --> 00:22:37,730
Listen, I wanted to talk to you.

323
00:22:38,456 --> 00:22:40,849
Things between me and Saul

324
00:22:41,591 --> 00:22:43,736
just got so crazy.

325
00:22:43,951 --> 00:22:47,407
I step off that Raptor and boom,
we're making love.

326
00:22:47,938 --> 00:22:48,943
And

327
00:22:49,151 --> 00:22:51,000
less than a day later, I'm...

328
00:22:51,248 --> 00:22:52,453
I'm screaming at him.

329
00:22:53,021 --> 00:22:55,273
But we were always, always,

330
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,500
always like that.

331
00:23:00,336 --> 00:23:01,819
Anyway, I just...

332
00:23:02,898 --> 00:23:04,698
I wanted to assure you.

333
00:23:08,224 --> 00:23:10,096
He didn't tell you about the sex.

334
00:23:13,008 --> 00:23:14,024
Frak.

335
00:23:14,738 --> 00:23:15,743
I'm...

336
00:23:18,176 --> 00:23:20,280
I come here to try to be good and...

337
00:23:23,273 --> 00:23:24,277
Look.

338
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,071
Don't worry.

339
00:23:27,925 --> 00:23:30,938
Seriously. Because
you have all the proof right there

340
00:23:31,063 --> 00:23:32,449
that he loves you.

341
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,777
You know, when we were still trying
to have our own,

342
00:23:36,902 --> 00:23:38,791
he always brought up
the name "Liam".

343
00:23:41,855 --> 00:23:43,580
Pure Cylon baby.

344
00:23:45,489 --> 00:23:46,837
If Simon knew,

345
00:23:46,962 --> 00:23:48,583
he'd want it so badly.

346
00:23:49,264 --> 00:23:50,845
I'll take care of this child.

347
00:23:51,947 --> 00:23:54,152
That wasn't a threat, Caprica.

348
00:23:55,696 --> 00:23:56,700
No.

349
00:23:58,197 --> 00:23:59,579
It was a threat.

350
00:24:04,238 --> 00:24:06,611
I don't know why
you couldn't have children, Ellen.

351
00:24:07,225 --> 00:24:10,487
Sometimes love must
not be enough because he loved you.

352
00:24:14,068 --> 00:24:15,153
Yes, this...

353
00:24:17,176 --> 00:24:18,356
This is rough.

354
00:24:20,021 --> 00:24:21,334
But what can I do?

355
00:24:22,827 --> 00:24:25,538
If I make him choose
between you and me,

356
00:24:25,908 --> 00:24:29,252
I know the best I could do
would be to tear him in half.

357
00:24:29,377 --> 00:24:30,378
Don't.

358
00:24:34,059 --> 00:24:35,138
I won't.

359
00:24:41,879 --> 00:24:42,980
You win.

360
00:24:43,438 --> 00:24:44,955
The man loves you.

361
00:24:46,345 --> 00:24:49,463
In fact, I'd say there isn't much
he loves more.

362
00:25:04,288 --> 00:25:06,379
Here you go, Gaius. Here you go.

363
00:25:07,136 --> 00:25:09,184
Here you go. Take that to mommy.

364
00:25:09,309 --> 00:25:10,768
Here you go. There you go.

365
00:25:10,893 --> 00:25:14,432
The marines tried this already, Gaius,
and people started pushing and grabbing.

366
00:25:14,557 --> 00:25:16,931
The marines have assault rifles,
not handguns.

367
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:19,310
Look around you, Paulla, will you?
Look around.

368
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:22,137
Can you see anybody rioting?
Can you? No.

369
00:25:22,761 --> 00:25:24,977
- There's no uniforms here.
- Come, come.

370
00:25:25,102 --> 00:25:27,716
There's no sense of oppression.
It's just...

371
00:25:28,146 --> 00:25:30,167
It's just one soul touching another,
isn't it?

372
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,418
Well, we need the food.

373
00:25:33,293 --> 00:25:35,838
Paulla, when you share your food,

374
00:25:35,963 --> 00:25:37,261
God makes it tenfold.

375
00:25:37,386 --> 00:25:39,334
You watch me.
You're going to learn something.

376
00:25:39,459 --> 00:25:41,567
You're gonna want
to step away from those.

377
00:25:44,696 --> 00:25:45,699
Really?

378
00:25:46,786 --> 00:25:48,303
And who will you be?

379
00:25:48,834 --> 00:25:50,780
Step away from the supplies.

380
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,342
Ladies,

381
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,287
show this man we are armed.

382
00:25:56,391 --> 00:25:57,394
Do it.

383
00:25:58,228 --> 00:26:00,335
Take it off the safety, Jeanne.

384
00:26:01,818 --> 00:26:03,186
Ours are bigger.

385
00:26:20,689 --> 00:26:21,920
Careful...

386
00:26:26,052 --> 00:26:29,120
So the five of you together at last.

387
00:26:29,937 --> 00:26:30,965
Any...

388
00:26:31,883 --> 00:26:33,822
mythic revelations?

389
00:26:34,528 --> 00:26:36,778
Nope. Nothing to report, sir.

390
00:26:45,747 --> 00:26:48,231
- You were born, right, Saul?
- What?

391
00:26:48,528 --> 00:26:49,750
You were born.

392
00:26:50,213 --> 00:26:51,484
On Earth. Yeah.

393
00:26:52,202 --> 00:26:53,668
I don't remember.

394
00:26:53,793 --> 00:26:54,814
But...

395
00:26:55,446 --> 00:26:57,081
I wouldn't anyway.

396
00:26:57,941 --> 00:27:00,385
Nature of the process, right?

397
00:27:03,769 --> 00:27:05,277
Not very machine-like of you.

398
00:27:05,402 --> 00:27:07,208
Great grandpa was a power sander.

399
00:27:18,807 --> 00:27:20,814
They're puttin' the stuff into her.

400
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:23,599
- The Cylon goop you said.
- Yeah.

401
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:24,964
If it works,

402
00:27:25,832 --> 00:27:28,950
she'll still be the Galactica
on the outside, but...

403
00:27:32,869 --> 00:27:35,388
She won't know what she is anymore.

404
00:27:41,674 --> 00:27:43,119
It'll save her.

405
00:27:43,402 --> 00:27:46,343
That along with Cylons flying cap.

406
00:27:49,377 --> 00:27:50,995
We need their help.

407
00:27:53,506 --> 00:27:54,669
I need your help.

408
00:27:57,062 --> 00:27:58,748
Laura and Lee know it.

409
00:28:00,264 --> 00:28:02,096
They don't think I see it.

410
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:05,891
But I do.

411
00:28:07,514 --> 00:28:08,542
I see it.

412
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:14,644
You never told me that the Sons of Aries
were involved in this.

413
00:28:14,769 --> 00:28:16,969
Of course they are, Gai.
Did you think they would stay

414
00:28:17,094 --> 00:28:19,649
out of something
as valuable as food supplies?

415
00:28:19,774 --> 00:28:22,450
Well, you didn't want to be
king of the fools anymore.

416
00:28:27,468 --> 00:28:30,797
No, the only thing worse
than being leader of this lot...

417
00:28:32,162 --> 00:28:33,919
would be being one of them.

418
00:28:34,243 --> 00:28:36,906
Did you really want to feed
those people?

419
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:47,111
I enjoyed it, actually. I did enjoy

420
00:28:47,953 --> 00:28:49,024
giving.

421
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:52,372
I loved it, actually.

422
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:53,923
The more I did it...

423
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,905
Done it long enough,
I'd have given them my heart.

424
00:29:02,308 --> 00:29:03,825
Well, do you think she's...

425
00:29:04,537 --> 00:29:08,329
telling them anything as moving as that?
Do you think she's giving them hope?

426
00:29:08,978 --> 00:29:10,331
She's not, is she?

427
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,657
What's Paulla been saying to you?

428
00:29:18,828 --> 00:29:21,550
Has Paulla been saying
that we mustn't help others?

429
00:29:23,539 --> 00:29:24,595
Because...

430
00:29:26,061 --> 00:29:27,207
I disagree.

431
00:29:28,825 --> 00:29:30,426
Has Paulla been saying

432
00:29:30,551 --> 00:29:31,602
that we can't

433
00:29:32,077 --> 00:29:34,639
help others because we're too weak?

434
00:29:36,057 --> 00:29:37,152
I disagree.

435
00:29:41,425 --> 00:29:42,562
Oh, Paulla.

436
00:29:44,888 --> 00:29:47,239
I am so disappointed with you.

437
00:29:49,506 --> 00:29:51,941
I'm disappointed with all of you.

438
00:29:52,894 --> 00:29:54,318
Here you all are.

439
00:29:54,752 --> 00:29:56,505
I'm gone for three minutes

440
00:29:57,052 --> 00:30:00,600
and you're lapping up Paulla's
icy pragmatism.

441
00:30:02,521 --> 00:30:05,361
There is a way to feed ourselves

442
00:30:05,486 --> 00:30:07,513
and the people from Dogsville!

443
00:30:09,735 --> 00:30:11,622
There is a way to bring hope

444
00:30:12,494 --> 00:30:14,002
to the lower decks.

445
00:30:14,988 --> 00:30:18,342
To the whole of this poor ship.
There is a way to win!

446
00:30:19,193 --> 00:30:20,938
She thinks
we can't get what we need.

447
00:30:21,063 --> 00:30:24,113
She thinks
we can't get what we need.

448
00:30:24,653 --> 00:30:26,609
All we need is strength.

449
00:30:26,734 --> 00:30:29,011
All we need is strength!

450
00:30:29,654 --> 00:30:30,786
And strength

451
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,788
comes from within.

452
00:30:33,118 --> 00:30:34,719
We can get more guns.

453
00:30:35,342 --> 00:30:36,691
Better guns. Bigger guns.

454
00:30:36,816 --> 00:30:38,014
And guns!

455
00:30:38,435 --> 00:30:41,643
More guns. Bigger guns.
Better guns.

456
00:30:41,768 --> 00:30:44,460
And when we have those,
we will win!

457
00:31:07,525 --> 00:31:09,925
Thanks for seeing me alone.
I just...

458
00:31:10,314 --> 00:31:12,714
- I have to talk to you.
- Of course.

459
00:31:14,877 --> 00:31:16,949
Hate me, i'll take it.

460
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:21,576
But this is bigger than that.
Galactica needs the baseship.

461
00:31:26,127 --> 00:31:28,618
Why did you even
make love to me, Saul,

462
00:31:28,817 --> 00:31:30,892
when your real love was at home?

463
00:31:31,265 --> 00:31:33,032
Did you even hear what I said?

464
00:31:33,488 --> 00:31:35,460
Bill needs the baseship.

465
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:37,432
I heard you.

466
00:31:37,889 --> 00:31:39,394
Did you hear me?

467
00:31:40,787 --> 00:31:43,139
Her brush is where mine used to be.

468
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,007
My dresses are gone.

469
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:47,774
She shares our bed.

470
00:31:47,899 --> 00:31:49,865
Do you remember,
I got us that mattress.

471
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:51,700
You went to my quarters.

472
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:54,828
Not interrupting?

473
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,655
Not at all. I was expecting you.

474
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:58,030
You called him?

475
00:31:59,724 --> 00:32:01,027
Good. Come on in.

476
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:03,771
You too, Caprica.

477
00:32:04,001 --> 00:32:05,172
What is this?

478
00:32:05,956 --> 00:32:08,884
We're joining the baseship.
All of us.

479
00:32:10,063 --> 00:32:12,972
- We can jump away when you're ready.
- Thank you.

480
00:32:13,357 --> 00:32:15,015
- It's the right decision.
- No.

481
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:16,350
No, it's not. No.

482
00:32:16,544 --> 00:32:20,521
The vote is you and Anders
versus me, Tory

483
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:21,812
and Galen.

484
00:32:22,137 --> 00:32:25,150
Caprica, obviously,
that means you have to come too.

485
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:27,390
Wouldn't you like
to raise your child where it's safe?

486
00:32:27,515 --> 00:32:29,349
I want him to be safe, yes.

487
00:32:29,655 --> 00:32:32,360
She doesn't understand
what this means.

488
00:32:32,626 --> 00:32:35,615
I used to think Hera
was the only hope for us.

489
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,913
But clearly
that's just not true anymore.

490
00:32:40,054 --> 00:32:42,440
Her baby, he's pure Cylon.

491
00:32:42,865 --> 00:32:45,546
If we go off and make
some pure Cylon culture,

492
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:47,590
that's what happened on Earth

493
00:32:47,758 --> 00:32:49,408
and it led to disaster.

494
00:32:49,539 --> 00:32:51,218
Pure human doesn't work.

495
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,929
Pure Cylon doesn't work.
It's too weak.

496
00:32:54,163 --> 00:32:56,557
You just don't want to leave
the one you really love.

497
00:32:57,056 --> 00:32:58,056
What?

498
00:32:58,735 --> 00:33:01,687
- Talk to me. What is this?
- It's petty and vile.

499
00:33:02,174 --> 00:33:03,897
Enough. She's voted.

500
00:33:04,263 --> 00:33:06,879
When's the jump?
We can be ready in an hour.

501
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:09,674
- I'm not goin'.
- We agreed on majority rule.

502
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:12,762
Frak, apparently
we invented majority rule.

503
00:33:12,887 --> 00:33:14,976
But I don't remember it,
so frak that.

504
00:33:15,817 --> 00:33:17,745
Saul, don't let her...

505
00:33:19,861 --> 00:33:21,749
All right, go. Go.

506
00:33:22,004 --> 00:33:23,000
All of you.

507
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:24,293
Caprica. Go.

508
00:33:25,397 --> 00:33:27,796
Go be pure and safe and whatever

509
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:30,799
- the frak. I'm not goin'.
- Do you see, little girl?

510
00:33:32,248 --> 00:33:34,292
There is something in the universe

511
00:33:34,417 --> 00:33:37,264
that he loves far more than you

512
00:33:37,609 --> 00:33:38,609
or me...

513
00:33:39,904 --> 00:33:41,310
And that's Bill Adama.

514
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:43,238
You don't even want to go.

515
00:33:44,209 --> 00:33:45,827
This is all to hurt me.

516
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:49,791
- Bill Adama, the ship and the uniform.
- How can you sink so low?

517
00:33:49,916 --> 00:33:52,071
- Everything else takes second place.
- Why doing this?

518
00:33:52,476 --> 00:33:53,626
I knew I did.

519
00:33:53,924 --> 00:33:55,949
But I always wondered
if a baby would.

520
00:33:59,067 --> 00:34:00,287
Guess I know now.

521
00:34:05,401 --> 00:34:06,710
Something's wrong...

522
00:34:07,183 --> 00:34:08,504
Get Cottle.

523
00:34:11,234 --> 00:34:12,466
You'll be okay.

524
00:34:13,439 --> 00:34:15,760
Never seen anyone
get into trouble so fast,

525
00:34:15,885 --> 00:34:18,073
but he's fighting back.
That's all I can tell you.

526
00:34:18,198 --> 00:34:20,166
- I didn't mean this.
- Yeah, you did.

527
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:22,247
Here, this may help
increase his heart rate.

528
00:34:23,215 --> 00:34:26,287
You knew how I would have to choose.
You knew what it meant.

529
00:34:26,501 --> 00:34:27,653
I'm sorry.

530
00:34:28,331 --> 00:34:31,110
Of course, Cylons and humans
need to stay together.

531
00:34:31,656 --> 00:34:33,862
But I always intended... I just...

532
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,197
I didn't think.

533
00:34:35,438 --> 00:34:37,866
Saul, I only wanted to hurt you,

534
00:34:38,304 --> 00:34:40,703
- not her.
- You didn't think I would hurt her,

535
00:34:40,955 --> 00:34:43,973
if I let her go.
It never occurred to you?

536
00:34:44,098 --> 00:34:47,785
No wonder we had to invent them
some compassionate god to believe in.

537
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:49,962
We couldn't have them deify us,
could we?

538
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:52,881
- We didn't invent anything.
- Shut up. Just stop!

539
00:34:55,223 --> 00:34:56,510
I'm so sorry.

540
00:34:56,955 --> 00:34:57,955
Maybe...

541
00:34:59,768 --> 00:35:01,303
I just shouldn't be here.

542
00:35:01,643 --> 00:35:03,943
First intelligent thing you've said.

543
00:35:37,056 --> 00:35:38,135
Talk to her.

544
00:35:38,733 --> 00:35:40,333
Tell her you love her.

545
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:42,536
It's what she needs.

546
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,108
It's what the baby needs.

547
00:35:58,643 --> 00:35:59,643
Listen.

548
00:36:00,813 --> 00:36:01,813
I love you,

549
00:36:02,822 --> 00:36:03,822
all right?

550
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:06,505
Can you hear me?

551
00:36:10,116 --> 00:36:12,607
This is nonsense. She knows it.

552
00:36:13,125 --> 00:36:15,962
I don't need to say it.
I shouldn't need to say it to anyone.

553
00:36:16,087 --> 00:36:17,601
Isn't it enough that I feel it?

554
00:36:17,726 --> 00:36:19,436
- Just tell her.
- I feel it.

555
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:23,161
For her. For you. For Liam.

556
00:36:24,956 --> 00:36:28,947
Shouldn't need to spout the words.
I feel it less with words.

557
00:36:31,211 --> 00:36:33,461
Just let me Gods damn feel it

558
00:36:33,586 --> 00:36:37,050
and I'll fill the frakkin' room.

559
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:55,685
His heart rate is dropping.
I got signs of distress all over.

560
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:56,836
Doesn't look good.

561
00:36:57,248 --> 00:36:58,882
I am so sorry.

562
00:37:00,978 --> 00:37:03,637
Cut him out.
Even if it kills me.

563
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:05,682
He'll live
if you cut him out right now.

564
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,328
Cylon babies must be strong, right?

565
00:37:10,321 --> 00:37:12,604
Hera was born early.
Cut him out.

566
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:15,691
I am not cutting you. Forget it.
He'll never make it. Four months?

567
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:17,032
- No.
- Please.

568
00:37:20,327 --> 00:37:22,380
Caprica, listen,

569
00:37:23,389 --> 00:37:24,783
I have to tell you.

570
00:37:25,595 --> 00:37:28,145
He loves you
more than he ever loved me.

571
00:37:28,588 --> 00:37:31,508
You are the mother of his son.

572
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:33,959
The boy is alive. I can see

573
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:36,556
his heartbeat on the monitor.
And that's proof.

574
00:37:36,861 --> 00:37:38,213
Proof he loves you.

575
00:37:38,951 --> 00:37:40,299
He loves you so much.

576
00:37:41,361 --> 00:37:42,759
It's shining out of him.

577
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:46,388
You and he can stay on Galactica.

578
00:37:47,138 --> 00:37:48,932
I'll go away with the others.

579
00:37:49,174 --> 00:37:50,874
And you can be together.

580
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:52,686
A little family.

581
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:54,110
I promise it.

582
00:37:56,692 --> 00:37:58,629
That's it. I'm sorry.

583
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:05,590
No, that was me.

584
00:38:06,254 --> 00:38:08,243
That was me.
I take it back. I'm sorry.

585
00:38:08,496 --> 00:38:11,584
The lady and I have some work to do.
It's time for you to leave.

586
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,455
You have to go now.
Nurse!

587
00:38:15,458 --> 00:38:16,501
Out now.

588
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,631
She's in good hands.

589
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:36,046
The two of you can stay here
and listen to this.

590
00:38:36,358 --> 00:38:38,782
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna go to the head.

591
00:38:39,121 --> 00:38:41,532
Do something constructive.
A little project I've been working on.

592
00:38:41,657 --> 00:38:43,005
Listen to me, Admiral.

593
00:38:43,532 --> 00:38:44,853
Just wait.

594
00:38:47,818 --> 00:38:49,264
Explain what you mean.

595
00:38:54,255 --> 00:38:57,042
What you have right now
is starving civilians

596
00:38:57,577 --> 00:39:00,420
with no representation, no recourse.

597
00:39:02,648 --> 00:39:03,898
They're broken.

598
00:39:04,264 --> 00:39:06,343
They're exhausted.
They've had enough.

599
00:39:06,773 --> 00:39:08,428
That's not a mutiny, Admiral.

600
00:39:08,942 --> 00:39:11,228
- That is a revolution.
- And you can maintain order?

601
00:39:11,353 --> 00:39:13,469
Listen to me. List...
Please, Admiral!

602
00:39:15,451 --> 00:39:18,814
Galactica is slipping away from you
drop by drop.

603
00:39:19,139 --> 00:39:22,424
You are pouring Cylon blood
into her veins.

604
00:39:22,549 --> 00:39:25,585
I see the Cylon pilots.
We all see them.

605
00:39:27,005 --> 00:39:28,740
We all see the Cylon workforce.

606
00:39:29,893 --> 00:39:32,452
Where are they going
into the far recesses of the ship?

607
00:39:32,893 --> 00:39:35,202
When are you inviting
the Centurions over to join

608
00:39:35,327 --> 00:39:38,208
in all the fun we're having over here?
Of course, when you do that,

609
00:39:39,901 --> 00:39:41,222
that very moment,

610
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:43,380
this becomes a blended ship.

611
00:39:43,847 --> 00:39:45,803
Only half human.

612
00:39:47,901 --> 00:39:50,928
And right now
I am here to tell you, your people...

613
00:39:52,669 --> 00:39:54,606
Your people are not ready for that.

614
00:39:57,321 --> 00:39:58,544
Listen to me, Admiral.

615
00:39:59,138 --> 00:40:02,192
I am offering you
the last human solution

616
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:04,328
you will ever be presented with.

617
00:40:17,671 --> 00:40:19,555
Well, guys, you did it.

618
00:40:20,341 --> 00:40:22,570
I don't know how, but you did.

619
00:40:22,877 --> 00:40:24,823
I told you, Paulla. I told you.

620
00:40:25,225 --> 00:40:27,644
You do good deeds
and you are rewarded.

621
00:40:28,752 --> 00:40:32,207
You're rewarded ten... Tenfold.
And then if you give...

622
00:40:32,877 --> 00:40:34,639
Then you receive, don't you?

623
00:40:35,636 --> 00:40:36,948
That was beautiful.

624
00:41:24,543 --> 00:41:25,543
I'm sorry.

625
00:41:30,757 --> 00:41:31,757
Liam.

626
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:34,319
His name was Liam.

627
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:38,080
It's a good name.

628
00:41:38,748 --> 00:41:40,507
- Short for William.
- Yeah.

629
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:44,605
It's not like that. I know.
I know it's not.

630
00:41:46,034 --> 00:41:47,034
I know.

631
00:41:47,516 --> 00:41:48,516
It's okay.

632
00:41:49,241 --> 00:41:50,241
It's okay.

633
00:42:34,231 --> 00:42:37,606
These are the Cylons that have died
with us since the alliance.

634
00:42:39,365 --> 00:42:42,071
I didn't know they were doing that.
Did you?

635
00:42:45,985 --> 00:42:48,135
It's already happened, hasn't it?
