1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,920
TWELVE CYLON MODELS

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:08,400
SEVEN ARE KNOWN

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,350
FOUR LIVE IN SECRET

4
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,770
ONE WILL BE REVEALED

5
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,190
previously on battlestar galactica.

6
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,780
I just finished the post-flight on starbuck's viper.

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,640
This thing looks like it's been rolled off the showroom floor.

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,300
It's time to get some answers.

9
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:32,190
Plug it in.

10
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,120
Jump!

11
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,160
president roslin was apparently aboard the cylon baseship,

12
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:43,290
along with gaius baltar and many of galactica's pilots when it jumped away.

13
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,340
waiting alone in a raptor as the rest of the fleet jump away.

14
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,150
That sounds a lot like suicide,dad.

15
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,480
Why are you doing this?

16
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,230
because I can't live without her.

17
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,070
we have d'anna onboard.

18
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,310
We are clear of the hub.

19
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,390
Commence nuclear trike.

20
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,350
So you know about the final five.

21
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,590
I know they're supposed to know the way to earth.

22
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,910
I've gotta worry about protecting myself.

23
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:11,160
I will tell you when you take me back to your fleet.

24
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,700
I love you.

25
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,910
About time.

26
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:43,660
Hey there,mr.Prez.

27
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,460
Heard you were here.

28
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,560
Temple of aurora.

29
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,580
On earth.

30
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,390
At least the way pythia described it.

31
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,210
We'll get there.

32
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,580
Walk those halls together.

33
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,570
Yeah,pretty to think so.

34
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:11,870
This roslin's stuff?

35
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,520
It's weird for them to not be here.

36
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,880
No one sits in his chair.

37
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,920
Tigh can't even look at it.

38
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:25,420
You know,the scariest thing my mom used to tell me when I was a kid,

39
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,910
"your father is waiting for you in the study."

40
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,830
I'd knock on the door.

41
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,520
Make the long walk across the room.

42
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,510
To that desk.

43
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,360
You know,leoben said something to me

44
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:49,280
when he was holding me in that doll house on new caprica.

45
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:54,020
That children are born to replace their parents.

46
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:59,630
For children to reach their full potential their parents have to die.

47
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,510
We rejoin your fleet in less than an hour.

48
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,100
Then we will return your final five to you.

49
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,160
Four.

50
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,020
There are four in your fleet.

51
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,250
Four.

52
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,070
Where's the fifth?

53
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,370
I want the four in your fleet.

54
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,700
It would be easier if you just tell us who they are.

55
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,650
Oh,easier because you could kill them.

56
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,610
Why would we do that?

57
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,380
They know the way to earth.We need them.

58
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,040
She's right.We all want the same thing.

59
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:36,930
- If we cooperate...
- we cooperated on new caprica,brother.

60
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,980
It didn't work out well.

61
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:44,820
I'm going to hold your people hostage until the final four are safely aboard this ship.

62
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,510
You need to stand down,bill.

63
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,680
Come on.

64
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,850
Trust me.

65
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,600
Stand down.

66
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,420
Pass the word around.

67
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,940
Stack arms.

68
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:20,530
I've already had an eight prepare a raptor,

69
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,090
so we'll launch as soon as we come out of the jump.

70
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:28,320
Oh,and,admiral,you'll be coming along with me to galactica.

71
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:31,120
- I'm not going.
- Bill,go.

72
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:37,220
Ifhe cylons get the four,they get earth.

73
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,920
You can't let this happen.

74
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:42,140
Even if you do blow this ship to hell.

75
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,870
Oh,godsdamn it.

76
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,270
I got it,felix.

77
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,370
Yeah.thanks.

78
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,420
Mr.Gaeta,do you wish to be relieved?

79
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,030
Good to go.

80
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,040
Dradis contact.

81
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:39,540
Incoming,bearing 1-8-5,carom 2-niner-niner at 1700.

82
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,400
- What do we got?
- Cylon baseship.

83
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,930
Another contact,same bearing.

84
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,360
It's a raptor.

85
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,550
Our people are back,sir.

86
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,690
Maybe she won't be able to identify us.

87
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,660
Gods,it's...it's good to have you back.

88
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,640
It's good to be home.

89
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,720
The goods news is that your president,laura roslin,

90
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:50,250
is alive and well,as are your crewmates.

91
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,830
She wants the four cylons that are in this fleet.

92
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,760
She's gonna hold our people hostage until she gets them.

93
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,560
You don't have to do anything except stay out of the way.

94
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,350
I'm already in contact with them.

95
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,970
Now that they realize there's nothing to fear

96
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,400
and that we only want to love and protect them,

97
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:08,080
they should find a way of joining us.

98
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,520
I just ask that you don't interfere with any of the shuttle traffic in the fleet.

99
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,730
So your plan is you take these four cylons

100
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,750
and then you head off to earth,leaving us behind.

101
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:19,000
Now that's up to them.

102
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,840
All right.

103
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:25,400
If these four cylons want to come to you,they're free to do so.

104
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,930
I will not stop them.

105
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,680
Do you agree with this,admiral?

106
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,030
Agreed.

107
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:36,580
Well,then I will await them on the baseship.

108
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,950
Laura roslin needs her medication.

109
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,960
And I need to make sure that she's all right.

110
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,690
- I'm gonna go with them.
- No.

111
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,380
We can't give them any more hostages.

112
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,090
the colonel's right.

113
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:57,370
I served under roslin for two years.

114
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,450
My place is by her side.

115
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:03,140
Another hostage isn't gonna change the equation.

116
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,340
All right,go.

117
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,050
Thank you.

118
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,080
I backed your play,and now what?

119
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,650
Starbuck goes to work on a plan to get our people back by force.

120
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:26,470
If we can't stop the cylons from reaching the baseship,

121
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:29,120
laura roslin wants it destroyed.

122
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:32,040
Half our guys are over there.

123
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,550
It's your call,mr.President.

124
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,930
Roslin's right.

125
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,700
We lose those four,we lose earth.

126
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:54,000
If everything goes south,we destroy the baseship and everyone on it.

129

39,665 SURVIVORS

130
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,340
IN SEARCH OF A HOME

131
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,690
CALLED EARTH

132
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,950
<font color="#ffff00">Battlestar Galactica
Season4 Episode10</font>

133
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,400
so the prisoners were here,

134
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,400
but d'anna has to know that you brought me in on this.

135
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:52,400
If she's moved the prisoners,it'll mean a compartment by compartment fight.

136
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:55,310
And if they open fire on the civilian fleet while we're boarding?

137
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:58,490
They could wipe out the human race right there and then.

138
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,660
that's why we need to make sure that

139
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:02,120
our raptors are already out there with their nukes cocked and locked.

140
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,860
There's gotta be other options.

141
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:06,780
Yeah,those frakkin' four could give themselves up.

142
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,120
Brothers and sisters,this is a great day for us.

143
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:25,560
One of our lost siblings has arrived.

144
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,610
She's one of the final five?

145
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,440
I saw her in my vision.

146
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:36,250
Now she's come home.

147
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,270
Laura.

148
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:48,660
there's been something I've been meaning to say to you.

149
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,420
- I wanted to thank you.- Um,for what?

150
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,070
Essentially for not murdering me.

151
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:06,150
That can't have been an easy decision to make.

152
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,730
But I love living.

153
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:18,990
I love living,and I wanted to thank you for saving my life.

154
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,360
I wouldn'T.

155
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:37,460
be so grateful if I were you.

156
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,710
You should know that I told the admiral that if d'anna doesn't back down,

157
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:43,150
he should blow the ship to pieces.

158
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:43,790
You what?

159
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,460
She's in here.

160
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,990
Madame president.

161
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,170
Gaius.

162
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,240
Tory.

163
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,960
Sit down.

164
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,280
I brought you your medication.

165
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,790
Oh,my gods.

166
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,670
How did you do that?

167
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,250
I came back with d'anna.

168
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,730
To be with my people.

169
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,830
Because you're one of the five.

170
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:20,590
You're one of the final five.

171
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,400
D'anna saw her.

172
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,180
In a vision.

173
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,620
I knew it.

174
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:31,710
Maybe not on a conscious level,

175
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:35,010
but subconsciously,I always knew there was something.

176
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,270
You had no idea.

177
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,760
Did you?

178
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,070
No.

179
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:46,870
Might be worth pondering what else you've been wrong about.

180
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,540
Tory,wait.

181
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,260
You're right.

182
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:59,960
I'm wrong.

183
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,000
Okay.

184
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,780
You are one of the revered final five,

185
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:08,930
and as such,the cylons will listen to you.

186
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:11,220
Is that not right?

187
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,910
So,tory,please go to d'anna

188
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:20,550
and try to convince her to back down and release all the hostages.

189
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:23,180
I'm done taking orders from you.

190
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,830
oh,mr.President,there has been a change of plans.

191
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,060
I've just executed the first of the colonial hostages.

192
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:52,380
Another will follow every quarter hour until our people come home.

193
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,150
All right,listen to me.

194
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,570
You're not giving us a chance.

195
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,610
We are cooperating.

196
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,680
She terminated the transmission.

197
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:14,000
All right then,admiral,you're a go for the rescue mission.

198
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,540
If it fails.

199
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,440
destroy the baseship.

200
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,200
Yes,mr.President.

201
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:37,280
All right,put these pilots in their cockpits.

202
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:40,550
Check all systems,and let's put these birds in the tubes.

203
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,690
Got it,chief.

204
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,020
There you go.

205
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,360
Apu won't spin up.

206
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,470
There's gotta be a short,and damned if I can find it.

207
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,810
But I set some guys tracking on it.

208
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,840
Galen,you with me?

209
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,480
You all know that we have a baseship out there with our people on it.

210
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:04,930
It is our job to get them back alive.

211
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,300
So speed is the only thing we have on our side.

212
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,380
They're no doubt expecting us to try for a breakout,

213
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,230
so we have to get in under their reaction time,which is damn fast.

214
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:16,420
Raptor flights two and six under athena will be our breaching force.

215
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,070
What's the matter?

216
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,460
I'm hearing it again.

217
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,230
All right.

218
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:53,830
Anyone know what the frak we're doing here?

219
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:55,980
I don't know.I just felt compelled.

220
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,350
Something about this viper.

221
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:02,220
Like what?

222
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:07,380
You checked every rivet and washer on that bird,and you didn't find squat.

223
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:10,030
Yeah,well,something brought us here.

224
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,930
Something's changed.

225
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,990
I just don't know what it is.

226
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,190
Maybe kara can help.

227
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,880
She flew this thing to earth and back.

228
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,380
Go find her.See what she can tell you.

229
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,630
But hurry up.

230
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:32,660
A lot of good people are gonna die.

231
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:36,350
So where are you going?

232
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:58,100
Bill,you gotta scrub this mission.

233
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,520
What the hell are you doing here?

234
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,380
You're supposed to be in the cic.

235
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:05,330
The cylons will kill every godsdamn hostage

236
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,160
before we put one pair of boots aboard their ship.

237
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:13,640
Laura roslin will be the next to die,bill.

238
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,440
I'm looking for options.

239
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,100
You got one?

240
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:27,320
Yeah.

241
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:33,490
I should've told you when I first found out,but I didn't have the guts.

242
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:40,290
What's wrong with you,saul?

243
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:47,230
Remember back at the nebula when I told you about that frakkin' music?

244
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,280
I thought it was in the ship.

245
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,210
I was wrong.

246
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,120
It was a signal.

247
00:17:53,170 --> 00:18:00,070
Some kind of crazy,frakked-up cylon signal switched me on.

248
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:06,770
I can't turn it off.

249
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,660
Switched you on.

250
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:15,460
Like boomer.

251
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,260
I'm one of the five.

252
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:22,880
The five.

253
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:26,350
One of the cylons d'anna's after.

254
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,610
Quit frakkin' with me.

255
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,230
Colonel,I've known you for 30 years.

256
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,770
I told you.

257
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,540
I didn't find out until the nebula.

258
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:43,640
Think about this.

259
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:47,690
When I met you,you had hair.

260
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:51,010
I never heard of a cylon aging.

261
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,400
Doesn't mean they don'T.

262
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,800
Before the attack on the colonies,

263
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,560
we didn't know skinjobs existed.

264
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,030
Turns out there's another kind of cylon we didn't know about,

265
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,370
and I'm one of them.

266
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,730
On new caprica,you were in captivity.

267
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,330
They did something to you.

268
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:21,270
They...an implant,a post-hypnotic suggestion that makes you feel this way.

269
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,820
Let's go talk to doc cottle...

270
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,760
listen to me!

271
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,610
It is not a delusion.

272
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:30,810
It is not a chip in my head.I am a cylon.

273
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,180
I've fooled you for months now.

274
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:35,010
I didn't want to,but I did.

275
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,500
Get your hands off of me.

276
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:39,500
If I had the guts to airlock myself when I first found out,

277
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,350
we wouldn't be in this mess.

278
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,430
But that's the way out.

279
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,830
Not this suicidal attack.

280
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,130
I am one of the final five.

281
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:58,400
D'anna will back down if you threaten to flush me out an airlock.

282
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,530
Dad,dad.

283
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,030
Dad,listen.

284
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,250
No one suspected.

285
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,530
No one.

286
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:15,260
Not with his record,what he did on new caprica.

287
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:23,040
His eye,what happened to his wife... come on,let's get up.

288
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:26,940
What have I done?

289
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:32,400
All the people I've sent to die.

290
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,380
For what?

291
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:37,530
For what?

292
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,080
For earth.

293
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:41,830
There is no earth.

294
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,520
It's a frakkin' joke.

295
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,870
There is no earth.

296
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:49,060
Okay,dad,listen to me.

297
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,440
Listen to me!

298
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,800
Pull it together.

299
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,720
- I can'T.
- Yes,you can.Come on.

300
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,250
- I can'T.
- Yes,you can.

301
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,570
I can't... I can't kill him.

302
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,050
I can't kill the bastard.

303
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:00,760
I can'T.

304
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:02,360
- Okay,okay,dad.
- I can'T.

305
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:05,160
It's...it's gonna be okay.

306
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,600
It's gonna be okay.

307
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,100
I'll...I'll take care of it.

308
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,220
I can'T.

309
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:11,010
I'll take care of it.

310
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:31,480
You mother-frakker.

311
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,450
Who are the others?

312
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:38,550
Where's the old man?

313
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,950
Right where you put him.

314
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:46,160
Mr.President,it's the cic.

315
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:49,110
D'anna's on the line.

316
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,310
This is the president.

317
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,290
mr.President.

318
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,950
you're running out of time.

319
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,190
no,you are.

320
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,700
It's your turn to listen.

321
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,120
If you harm another one of my people,

322
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,870
you so much as blacken one of their eyes,

323
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:18,680
and I flush saul tigh out of the launch tube.

324
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,910
we have no wish for further bloodshed.

325
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,620
May I speak with the admiral?

326
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:26,350
No,you deal with me.

327
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,320
You have ten minutes to release my people

328
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:32,470
or you can kiss one of your precious final five good-bye.

329
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:41,420
You want to save the fleet,I need the others,and I need them now.

330
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,850
it's sitting here the same way it has been for months.

331
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:48,380
What made you think something was happening?

332
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,370
Hard to explain.

333
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,420
You know,it's just a feeling.

334
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,060
Yeah,I've got a feeling too.

335
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,830
You're both out of your frakkin' minds.

336
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,010
You know,you had a feeling you could find earth.

337
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,950
I trusted you.

338
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,130
I backed you every step of the way.

339
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:03,410
Now I need you to trust ours.

340
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,040
Ensign anders.

341
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,390
Specialist tyrol.

342
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,810
Slowly put your hands on your heads and face the viper.

343
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,100
Do it now!

344
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,840
What the hell is going on?

345
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:23,940
They're cylons,just like the xo.

346
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,490
Sam.

347
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,690
Go ahead.

348
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,800
It's true,kara.

349
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:04,050
There's something different about this viper.

350
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:05,450
Something's changed.

351
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,260
You gotta find it.

352
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:07,520
shut up.

353
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,060
Fall back!

354
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:20,280
Fall back!

355
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,880
Where the hell are you taking us?

356
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:23,690
Keep moving.Otherwise,we shoot you here.

357
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,460
No!

358
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,630
This is a wild guess.

359
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:40,990
You told them.

360
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:43,390
We should've done it day one.

361
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:45,570
Get the baseship on the horn.

362
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,880
Mr. Hoshi,we need the baseship.

363
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,170
what's going on?

364
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,750
D'anna's about to start executing more hostages.

365
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,250
okay,take me to d'anna.

366
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,660
no,she won't listen to you.

367
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,140
I was the one with her in the temple

368
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,770
when she had the vision of the five...take me.

369
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:18,680
He's right.

370
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:20,710
Take him,it's good.

371
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,810
Are you ready to come to your senses,mr.President?

372
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:35,410
galen tyrol and samuel anders have just joined saul tigh in the airlock.

373
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,870
They found them.

374
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:40,150
They're in line for an express ride into a vacuum.

375
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,760
You want them alive,stand down.

376
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,480
I know lee.

377
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,280
Press him and he'll back down.

378
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:03,810
Target our nuclear weapons on the civilian fleet.

379
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,460
We'll see if he wants to play hardball.

380
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,700
D'anna.

381
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:11,240
Gaius.

382
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:40,970
Coercion won't work with lee adama.

383
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:42,390
He's too similar to his father.

384
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:43,370
Lee's bluffing.

385
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:47,520
He's doesn't give a tinker's damn about those three,not now.

386
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,910
You push him,he'll kill them.

387
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:53,700
Then the entire human race will die with them.

388
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,630
Mr.President,the baseship nukes just went hot.

389
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,730
If any of our fleet starts spooling up...

390
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:13,990
they won't have time to jump before the cylons fire.

391
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:18,370
Sergeant harder,clear the tube of everyone but tigh.

392
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,020
Corporal.

393
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:39,220
Do you really think that god brought you back from the darkness for this,d'anna?

394
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,280
Maybe he brought you back for a different purpose.

395
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,120
To end this peacefully.

396
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,280
They will never forgive us for what we did to the twelve colonies,never.

397
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:50,660
Proceed.

398
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,860
Brute force did not work for you on new caprica.

399
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,820
It didn't work for you on the algae planet.

400
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,010
So why is it gonna work for you now?

401
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,660
Give me the key.

402
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:47,670
We have weapons lock on their ships.

403
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,220
What are you waiting for,apollo?

404
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,360
Do it.

405
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:05,870
lee,stop!

406
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,510
Stop,stop!

407
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,880
Those three frakkin' cylons just gave us earth.

408
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:26,330
Well,it's a colonial emergency locator signal.

409
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:30,130
And no other wireless in the fleet is picking this up?

410
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:31,320
Gaeta's confirmed it.

411
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:34,230
The channel's empty except for this viper.

412
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,150
It's gotta be a signal from earth.

413
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:41,610
You're reaching,kara.

414
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:43,230
Come on,lee,add it up.

415
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,300
I vanish into a storm.

416
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,770
Ride this viper to earth.

417
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:48,010
Coming back,I get a vision that leads me to the baseship.

418
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:51,550
Its hybrid tells me that the final five cylons have been to earth,

419
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:55,070
but we need the missing three,d'anna,to bring them out into the open.

420
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:57,610
And now we're starting to get messages from the beyond.

421
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,720
You heard the signal.

422
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:01,800
The final cylons led me to it.

423
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:04,870
If it's earth,they've given us the home of the thirteenth tribe

424
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:07,020
just the way the hybrid said it would happen.

425
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:13,540
Like it or not,lee,something's orchestrating this for a purpose.

426
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,370
A higher power.

427
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:24,180
Call it whatever you want,but it seems to want us to find earth with the cylons.

428
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:52,370
One tiny needle in the whole fleet.

429
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,390
Well,you're right.It's wafer thin.

430
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:57,590
It's the best I could do at short notice.

431
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,530
So you're all in agreement this is the way to earth?

432
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,920
It's a stretch,but it's the best explanation we've got.

433
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:07,700
Which is why we chose to share this information with you.

434
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:10,090
We could've jumped away with it,left you behind.

435
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:13,990
But that would've led to another confrontation,another standoff.

436
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:15,630
All this has happened before...

437
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,710
but it doesn't have to happen again.

438
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:22,110
Not if we make up our minds to change.

439
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,430
Take a different path.

440
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,500
Right here,right now.

441
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:30,580
You were afraid we'd kill these four,and yet,here they are,standing behind you.

442
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,240
Free to go.

443
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,220
Or stay.

444
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,040
I've granted them an amnesty.

445
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:43,950
So the question is,where do we go from here?

446
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,560
All right.

447
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:57,400
I'll release your crew.

448
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,460
We go to earth together.

449
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:17,420
We've projected a course toward the signal.

450
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,320
It'll probably take some revising as we go,but.

451
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,290
this is our destination right here.

452
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,030
Earth.

453
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,850
So.

454
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,390
what are your orders,admiral?

455
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:33,090
Orders?

456
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:38,720
Are you ready to take us to our new home?

457
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,320
I don't know.

458
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,850
you don't know what?

459
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:58,140
What don't you know about?

460
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:06,330
It's good to see you.

461
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:11,020
Bill.

462
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,950
this is it.

463
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:18,300
This is it.

464
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:25,620
This is everything that we have been working for.

465
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:36,760
I want to see you pick up that first fistful of earth.

466
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,930
Come on.

467
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:48,450
Frak.

468
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,150
I see.

469
00:34:58,210 --> 00:34:59,750
Yeah.

470
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,940
Thank you.

471
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Thank you.

472
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:08,190
Anyway,I'm glad to see you again,madame president.

473
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,480
And so is the quorum.

474
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:13,510
And I guess I just finished the shortest presidency in colonial history.

475
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:18,120
Yes,well,don't look so relieved,mr.Adama.

476
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:22,740
Because you were dealt a crisis and you knew exactly what to do.

477
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:24,690
You faced it boldly.

478
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:29,680
This fleet is going to need that kind of leadership in the days to come,

479
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:33,600
so you are not off the hook yet.

480
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,560
Thank you.

481
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:42,570
You guys just gonna sit here flapping your lips or are we gonna go find earth?

482
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,450
Kara and I have been working on a recon plan...

483
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:45,870
frak it.

484
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:48,150
This is the end of the line.

485
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:50,890
We've got nowhere else to go.

486
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:55,350
And if we give the alliance too much time,it'll fall apart again.

487
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:57,920
Gotta roll the hard six.

488
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:00,110
We all go together.

489
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:02,410
As fast as we can.

490
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,920
Yes,sir.

491
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,380
Fleet in jump formation.Standing by.

492
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,900
Board is green.

493
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:39,560
Ship reports ready to jump,admiral.

494
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:42,680
Very well.

495
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:49,870
Madame president,without you we wouldn't have made it.

496
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:53,780
Give the order.

497
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:02,160
It's been a long time coming.

498
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:06,270
Okay.

499
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:09,590
Take us to earth.

500
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,730
in five.

501
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:18,150
four.

502
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,690
three.

503
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:21,370
two.

504
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:22,630
one.

505
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:24,260
jump.

506
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,030
Jump complete.

507
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,880
dradis is clear.

508
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,780
fleet is checking in.

509
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,860
Nav.

510
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:44,760
Confirming position.

511
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:46,700
take your time.

512
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:48,580
Get it right.

513
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:52,300
Fleet all present and accounted for.

514
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,030
Visible constellations are a match.

515
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:21,190
Crew of galactica.

516
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:24,020
people of the fleet.

517
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,550
this is admiral adama.

518
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:30,280
Three years ago,I promised to lead you to a new home.

519
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,080
We've endured a difficult journey.

520
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:36,280
We've all lost,we've all suffered,

521
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:40,760
and the truth is I questioned whether this day would ever come.

522
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:45,140
But today,our journey is at an end.

523
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,230
We have arrived.

524
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,230
at earth.

525
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,500
We made it,kid.

526
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,540
We did it.

527
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,900
You did it.

528
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,360
Earth.
