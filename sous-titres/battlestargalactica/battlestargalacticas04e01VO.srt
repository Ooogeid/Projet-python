00:00:20,798 --> 00:00:22,949
<i>Previously on</i> Battlestar Galactica...

2
00:00:24,412 --> 00:00:28,267
I think the nova does look
like the mandala inside this temple.

3
00:00:28,783 --> 00:00:31,526
Maybe it was a road sign
on the path to Earth.

4
00:00:32,788 --> 00:00:35,538
It was on the temple.
Where'd you get the idea to paint yours?

5
00:00:35,699 --> 00:00:39,390
It was just something I've been doodling
since I was a kid, I liked the pattern.

6
00:00:40,494 --> 00:00:42,007
<i>Starbuck, you're getting too low.</i>

7
00:00:42,127 --> 00:00:43,672
Come on, Lee. Get her out of there.

8
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:45,757
- You come back!
- Just let me go.

9
00:00:45,918 --> 00:00:47,258
<i>They're waiting for me.</i>

10
00:00:49,723 --> 00:00:50,524
No!

11
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,765
Gaius Baltar,

12
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:58,077
after carefully weighing the evidence,
this tribunal finds you not guilty.

13
00:01:00,056 --> 00:01:02,376
Get him back! Get him out of here!


14
00:01:04,102 --> 00:01:05,777
Gaius, it's okay. Come with me.

15
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:08,655
- Where are you taking me to?
- To your new life. Come.

16
00:01:10,165 --> 00:01:12,659
We're going to the Ionian Nebula.
Sitrep!

17
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,829
Sensors show major power fluctuations.
Checking on fleet.

18
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:21,668
It's true.

19
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,149
We're Cylons.

20
00:01:24,289 --> 00:01:25,828
And we have been from the start.

21
00:01:28,448 --> 00:01:31,761
Dradis contact!
Massive Cylon fleet on intercept course.

22
00:01:31,922 --> 00:01:34,078
I want emergency jump, the entire fleet.

23
00:01:34,198 --> 00:01:37,246
Sir, all fleet ships were powered down
during the outage.

24
00:01:37,646 --> 00:01:40,020
It'll take at least 20 min
to spool up the FTL drives.

25
00:01:40,311 --> 00:01:42,021
We just don't have 20 minutes.

26
00:01:42,181 --> 00:01:44,274
Action stations.
Set condition 1 throughout the ship.

27
00:01:44,435 --> 00:01:47,152
<i>This is not a drill. All Viper pilots
report to Vipers immediately.</i>

28
00:01:47,312 --> 00:01:49,821
I have a bogey at my ten.
I'm gonna go check it out.

29
00:01:52,275 --> 00:01:53,504
What the frak?!

30
00:02:00,174 --> 00:02:01,838
- Hi, Lee.
- Kara?

31
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,731
I've been to Earth.

32
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,587
I know where it is.

33
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,547
And I'm gonna take us there.

34
00:02:31,203 --> 00:02:33,144
No, this is frakkin' crazy.

35
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,545
I saw your ship blow up.

36
00:02:35,665 --> 00:02:36,808
Afraid not.

37
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,497
Did you not hear me?
I've been to Earth.

38
00:02:41,124 --> 00:02:41,971
Earth.

39
00:02:42,757 --> 00:02:45,037
<i>Big blue oceans, fluffy white clouds.</i>

40
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,840
<i>You're gonna love it. I promise.</i>

41
00:02:49,965 --> 00:02:51,883
Identify that ship immediately.

42
00:02:52,043 --> 00:02:54,186
Sir, I'm checking
for colonial recognition codes.

43
00:02:54,306 --> 00:02:56,346
- Get Lee online!
- I'm trying, sir.

44
00:02:56,506 --> 00:02:58,973
- I'm picking up her ship's signature.
- That's her voice.

45
00:02:59,134 --> 00:03:01,059
Hold on. It is not real.
It is a trick.

46
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,280
- Duplicate verification.
- Checking.

47
00:03:11,688 --> 00:03:14,466
- Hostiles inbound! 200 plus!
- CAG, take 'em out!

48
00:03:14,586 --> 00:03:15,990
All players, Galactica.

49
00:03:16,289 --> 00:03:19,577
Threat B-R-3-5-0 carom 2-1-1.

50
00:03:19,738 --> 00:03:22,205
<i>Raptors, lean back as missile pickets.
Weapons free.</i>

51
00:03:22,365 --> 00:03:24,145
Don't lose me this time, Apollo.

52
00:03:25,516 --> 00:03:26,584
Not a chance.

53
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:34,214
Splash one!

54
00:03:36,073 --> 00:03:37,813
<i>Take that, you frakkin' toasters!</i>

55
00:03:37,933 --> 00:03:39,722
Admiral, it's a Cylon trick.

56
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:51,541
The Vipers have stopped
the main Cylon thrust,

57
00:03:51,661 --> 00:03:53,274
but the reserves have broken through.

58
00:03:53,394 --> 00:03:55,822
I want everything
that can fly up there immediately.

59
00:03:56,775 --> 00:03:57,576
Saul.

60
00:03:58,054 --> 00:03:58,867
Saul!

61
00:04:01,321 --> 00:04:02,912
What the hell is wrong with you?

62
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:04,674
Nothing, Bill.

63
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:07,431
Never felt better in my life.

64
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:30,039
Colonel Tigh!

65
00:04:31,684 --> 00:04:33,359
I gave you an order.

66
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,988
Everybody that's ever held a stick,
I want them up there now.

67
00:04:37,718 --> 00:04:38,981
Get 'em out!

68
00:04:39,397 --> 00:04:41,107
- Put 'em up there!
- Sir.

69
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:43,786
Attention. This is the XO.

70
00:04:43,947 --> 00:04:47,523
Let's go! Get that bird in the tube.
Get that Showboat bird in the tube.

71
00:04:47,643 --> 00:04:49,356
Where the frak are these nuggets?

72
00:04:49,476 --> 00:04:51,542
Mama's not gonna save you today!
Let's go!

73
00:04:51,662 --> 00:04:53,213
You want to fly or not?

74
00:04:55,191 --> 00:04:56,716
Ready or not, let's go.

75
00:04:57,085 --> 00:04:58,228
Hey, this is crazy.

76
00:04:58,348 --> 00:05:01,291
What if another switch flips in my head
and turns me against my own?

77
00:05:01,411 --> 00:05:03,849
Shut the frak up.
It's like the colonel said, okay?

78
00:05:03,969 --> 00:05:05,143
Just think of that.

79
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,328
Be the man you want to be
till the day you die.

80
00:05:07,448 --> 00:05:10,085
Easier said than done, I don't know
what the frak I am right now.

81
00:05:10,205 --> 00:05:12,525
You're Samuel T. Anders.
That's all you gotta remember.

82
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,219
- Now get the frak in your ship.
- Who else would he be?

83
00:05:15,465 --> 00:05:16,513
Hey, rook.

84
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:18,438
Stay cool out there, all right?

85
00:05:18,558 --> 00:05:20,913
You'll lock in
and do what you've been trained to do.

86
00:05:21,033 --> 00:05:23,516
It's just like suiting up
for a championship game, right?

87
00:05:23,636 --> 00:05:25,657
Yeah, that's right. Good hunting.

88
00:05:28,785 --> 00:05:31,742
If she didn't notice anything,
maybe the other Cylons won't either.

89
00:05:31,862 --> 00:05:34,462
Yeah, well, don't wait to find out.
Shoot first.

90
00:05:34,623 --> 00:05:36,676
Get the frak in there.
Go kill something.

91
00:05:37,815 --> 00:05:39,926
Let's go! Let's load these birds!

92
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:42,683
Anders, get the frak in your Viper!

93
00:05:50,057 --> 00:05:51,266
Where are you taking me?

94
00:05:51,386 --> 00:05:53,946
It's a place we found.
An unused compartment.

95
00:06:29,427 --> 00:06:31,769
- Sir, we've lost Pyxis!
- Oh, my Gods.

96
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:34,304
Captain Tarney.
600 souls on that ship.

97
00:06:36,352 --> 00:06:37,900
How did they find us?

98
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,697
That's the question, isn't it?

99
00:06:49,113 --> 00:06:50,662
Base ships launching missiles.

100
00:06:50,823 --> 00:06:53,751
40... correction, 50 plus inbound.

101
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,937
Half targeted on us, half on the fleet.

102
00:06:56,057 --> 00:06:58,838
Have triple-a target
only missiles going towards the fleet.

103
00:06:58,998 --> 00:07:01,139
- We can handle the hits. They can't.
- Sir.

104
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:04,679
All forces, priority intercept enemy
missiles targeting civilian vessels.

105
00:07:08,515 --> 00:07:09,978
I am Samuel T. Anders.

106
00:07:10,378 --> 00:07:13,311
I was born on Picon.
I went to Noyce elementary school.

107
00:07:13,472 --> 00:07:15,153
Get your thumb off the transmit button.

108
00:07:15,273 --> 00:07:17,016
- <i>You're blocking the freq.</i>
- Copy that.

109
00:07:19,524 --> 00:07:20,464
Frak me.

110
00:07:36,243 --> 00:07:37,585
<i>Longshot, Hardball.</i>

111
00:07:37,745 --> 00:07:40,004
Turkey, right four low at three,
committing.

112
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,050
<i>Longshot, I got the...</i>

113
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:46,717
Tally, I got your back.

114
00:07:51,161 --> 00:07:52,933
Seelix, there's a Raider on you!

115
00:07:58,571 --> 00:08:00,315
- <i>Shoot, Anders!</i>
- I'm trying to.

116
00:08:00,882 --> 00:08:02,152
Gods, come on!

117
00:08:50,651 --> 00:08:53,619
Sir, the Cylon strike force
has just turned back to their ships.

118
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:00,418
Base ships are spinning up.

119
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:02,587
They're pulling out.

120
00:09:03,005 --> 00:09:06,094
We're gonna do the same damn thing
before they change their mind.

121
00:09:06,842 --> 00:09:09,217
- Have fighters cover our withdrawal.
- Yes, sir.

122
00:09:09,378 --> 00:09:11,157
All fighters assume
rear cover formation.

123
00:09:11,277 --> 00:09:12,327
They had us.

124
00:09:12,474 --> 00:09:13,521
Game over.

125
00:09:14,113 --> 00:09:16,090
Why the hell did they let us go?

126
00:09:18,018 --> 00:09:19,270
Maybe something's changed.

127
00:09:21,262 --> 00:09:22,226
Like what?

128
00:09:26,385 --> 00:09:28,606
I have no idea, Madame President.

129
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,460
No idea.

Right.

137
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:26,130
Chief, I'm gonna need you to develop
my gun camera footage ASAP.

138
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,909
I've got a hell of a set
of vacation pictures.

139
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:35,050
I'll take my post-flight checklist.

140
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:38,065
I want to sign out
so I can get in the showers.

141
00:12:40,655 --> 00:12:42,097
I don't have one for you.

142
00:12:46,368 --> 00:12:47,385
What's up?

143
00:12:59,168 --> 00:13:00,037
Okay.

144
00:13:00,883 --> 00:13:02,659
Okay, me too. It's okay, it's okay.

145
00:13:03,964 --> 00:13:05,412
Do you believe in miracles?

146
00:13:07,867 --> 00:13:08,686
No.

147
00:13:14,019 --> 00:13:17,415
I told everyone that you were
too frakkin' mean to kill.

148
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,588
Okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.

149
00:13:21,036 --> 00:13:22,016
I'm okay.

150
00:13:23,147 --> 00:13:25,273
What the hell are you doing
in a jock smock?

151
00:13:25,393 --> 00:13:28,198
I just finished Viper transition
a week ago,

152
00:13:28,318 --> 00:13:29,697
and I started ACM.

153
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,140
How the...

154
00:13:32,872 --> 00:13:33,860
Starbuck!

155
00:13:37,461 --> 00:13:38,732
I did it, boss.

156
00:13:40,684 --> 00:13:41,864
I found Earth.

157
00:13:43,515 --> 00:13:44,743
Everybody move back.

158
00:13:44,904 --> 00:13:45,952
Hit their post.

159
00:13:46,164 --> 00:13:47,014
Move in.

160
00:13:47,489 --> 00:13:48,445
Step away!

161
00:13:48,933 --> 00:13:50,401
I need you in sickbay.

162
00:13:51,059 --> 00:13:53,668
Cottle's gonna give you
a complete physical examination.

163
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,920
What's going on?

164
00:13:55,295 --> 00:13:56,954
I'm off the ship for a few hours and...

165
00:13:57,074 --> 00:13:58,304
A few hours?

166
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,501
Kara, you were gone for over two months.

167
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:05,314
That's impossible.

168
00:14:06,697 --> 00:14:09,324
My ship's clock reads
six hours and change.

169
00:14:09,494 --> 00:14:11,484
Then your clock's wrong, Kara.

170
00:14:12,345 --> 00:14:13,950
Sam's telling you the truth.

171
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,823
We thought you were dead.

172
00:14:17,311 --> 00:14:18,216
What?

173
00:14:30,207 --> 00:14:33,878
Gaius, I just wanted you to know
that we'll be back soon.

174
00:14:34,048 --> 00:14:37,381
Whatever you do, please don't go
anywhere by yourself. It's not safe.

175
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:39,440
Tracey's here for anything you need.

176
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,064
We'll be back as soon as
we've looked in on Derek. Okay?

177
00:14:42,184 --> 00:14:44,802
Right... oh, Derek.
That's your little boy, isn't it?

178
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,057
- The one in sickbay.
- Right.

179
00:14:47,517 --> 00:14:48,447
Yes, I...

180
00:14:48,946 --> 00:14:50,795
I'm praying for his recovery.

181
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:52,519
- Really?
- Yeah.

182
00:14:52,731 --> 00:14:54,452
- Oh, thank you.
- It's a pleasure.

183
00:14:54,572 --> 00:14:55,500
Thank you.

184
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,315
So what's the game plan, ladies?

185
00:14:57,769 --> 00:14:58,628
Game plan?

186
00:14:58,748 --> 00:15:01,326
Well, this place is brilliant, really.

187
00:15:01,823 --> 00:15:03,279
You know, it's beautiful.

188
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,019
Just when am I getting out of here?
When I am getting off the ship?

189
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:08,136
Well, security's too tight. Besides...

190
00:15:08,256 --> 00:15:10,553
Besides what? You're just trying
to keep me here and...

191
00:15:10,673 --> 00:15:12,539
None of the other ships will have you.

192
00:15:17,173 --> 00:15:18,480
We'll be back.

193
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:24,695
Yesterday, you were facing execution.

194
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,994
Today you're free. Why the long face?

195
00:15:28,873 --> 00:15:30,404
Oh, gee, I don't know.

196
00:15:31,035 --> 00:15:33,481
From president of the colonies to this.

197
00:15:35,552 --> 00:15:36,764
King of fools.

198
00:15:38,315 --> 00:15:41,731
Probably best to be hated by everyone
than loved by this lot.

199
00:15:41,901 --> 00:15:44,654
Doomed to live out the rest of my life
in this loony bin.

200
00:15:45,562 --> 00:15:48,353
I don't know, that might have
something to do with my...

201
00:15:48,473 --> 00:15:50,267
rather savage mood swings.

202
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:53,320
Relax, Gaius.

203
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,291
You think I've brought you this far
just to let it end here?

204
00:15:56,602 --> 00:15:58,042
I need some encouragement.

205
00:15:58,438 --> 00:16:01,239
A ray of hope about the future.
An inkling...

206
00:16:01,832 --> 00:16:03,073
You've got me.

207
00:16:04,655 --> 00:16:05,994
I'm here for you.

208
00:16:08,316 --> 00:16:09,814
That is so beautiful.

209
00:16:15,256 --> 00:16:16,970
Hello. Sorry, what?

210
00:16:18,133 --> 00:16:19,356
The way you were praying.

211
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:23,893
Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, thank you, yeah.

212
00:16:24,254 --> 00:16:25,830
Not some hollow ritual.

213
00:16:26,188 --> 00:16:27,020
No,

214
00:16:27,422 --> 00:16:28,297
no.

215
00:16:28,712 --> 00:16:31,209
It's as if the Gods are right here
beside you.

216
00:16:31,329 --> 00:16:32,254
Well, yeah.

217
00:16:32,374 --> 00:16:34,298
When I pray to the Gods,

218
00:16:35,407 --> 00:16:36,429
I feel...

219
00:16:37,188 --> 00:16:37,993
empty.

220
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,522
Do you? That's a shame, isn't it?

221
00:16:41,691 --> 00:16:43,046
Her gods are false.

222
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:44,547
Tell her.

223
00:16:45,092 --> 00:16:48,221
Well, if you feel empty when you pray
to Zeus or Poseidon or Aphrodite,

224
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:49,567
it's because it is empty.

225
00:16:49,687 --> 00:16:52,136
It's a totally empty experience.
They're...

226
00:16:53,682 --> 00:16:54,683
They're not real.

227
00:16:55,692 --> 00:16:57,905
They've been promulgated by...

228
00:17:01,691 --> 00:17:03,506
a ruling elite...

229
00:17:04,818 --> 00:17:08,274
To stop you from learning the truth.

230
00:17:10,255 --> 00:17:11,905
And what truth is that?

231
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:14,702
That's a very good question.
What is the... the...

232
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:16,613
There's only one god.

233
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,550
There is only one god.

234
00:17:19,294 --> 00:17:21,326
In a nutshell, that's the truth.

235
00:17:24,231 --> 00:17:26,947
We're alone here, aren't we?
The others aren't coming back soon.

236
00:17:27,067 --> 00:17:28,583
And the door's locked.

237
00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:30,429
All right, good.

238
00:17:37,443 --> 00:17:39,214
Can you feel God's presence?

239
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:42,137
You know what? I think I do.

240
00:17:44,005 --> 00:17:46,261
- So do I.
- Do you? Do you too?

241
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,333
We both... we both feel...

242
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,360
So what's Cottle's verdict?

243
00:17:59,569 --> 00:18:01,099
Everything checks out.

244
00:18:01,972 --> 00:18:03,050
So I'm me,

245
00:18:03,534 --> 00:18:04,702
not a Cylon?

246
00:18:05,454 --> 00:18:07,681
That is why you had me tested, right?

247
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:10,842
- Kara, nobody said you were Cylon.
- But you were thinking it.

248
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,831
We had to be sure, Kara.

249
00:18:16,103 --> 00:18:17,219
Fair enough.

250
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:18,933
Let's go through it again.

251
00:18:19,574 --> 00:18:21,323
How many times do you want to hear it?

252
00:18:21,443 --> 00:18:24,332
As many times as it takes to make sense.

253
00:18:25,543 --> 00:18:28,570
I followed a raider into the storm.
Took some hits, passed out.

254
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,882
When I came to,
I was orbiting this planet.

255
00:18:31,002 --> 00:18:34,488
Its yellow moon and star matches
the description in Pythia.

256
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,702
I took these pictures in orbit.

257
00:18:36,822 --> 00:18:39,904
The star patterns match
what we saw in the tomb of Athena.

258
00:18:41,883 --> 00:18:45,144
- How did you get here?
- I told you, I don't know exactly.

259
00:18:45,407 --> 00:18:47,628
Well, that's just
not good enough, Captain.

260
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:50,978
Tell us everything you remember.

261
00:18:54,471 --> 00:18:56,750
I remember taking the photos.

262
00:18:57,357 --> 00:18:59,672
Turning my ship in a reciprocal heading.

263
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,553
And then I'm not sure.

264
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:11,691
I must've blacked out again.

265
00:19:14,269 --> 00:19:15,310
I remember

266
00:19:16,157 --> 00:19:18,758
a giant gas planet with rings.

267
00:19:19,943 --> 00:19:23,365
I remember a flashing triple star.

268
00:19:24,585 --> 00:19:25,733
And a comet.

269
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:28,489
And then I was back with the fleet.

270
00:19:29,706 --> 00:19:32,401
And for you, all of this took six hours.

271
00:19:32,668 --> 00:19:35,207
I do not understand
the time discrepancy either, okay?

272
00:19:35,327 --> 00:19:37,734
All I know is I was there.
I took the pictures.

273
00:19:37,904 --> 00:19:39,297
I didn't imagine it!

274
00:19:44,091 --> 00:19:45,875
I had my crew clean it up.

275
00:19:46,194 --> 00:19:48,404
There's not a ding or a scratch on it.

276
00:19:48,574 --> 00:19:51,262
It's got the same tail number
as the one she flew out on.

277
00:19:51,382 --> 00:19:53,564
But I've been fixing up that old bird
since day one,

278
00:19:53,684 --> 00:19:56,955
and this thing looks like
it's been rolled off the showroom floor.

279
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,960
So it's not the same ship.

280
00:20:01,217 --> 00:20:05,113
Unless she found a hell of a body shop
out there, no, ma'am, it's not.

281
00:20:07,703 --> 00:20:10,416
Admiral,
it's just not the outside either.

282
00:20:10,717 --> 00:20:13,241
This is the data from the nav computer.

283
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,667
There isn't any. It's blank.

284
00:20:16,296 --> 00:20:19,146
There's no record
of where this ship has been.

285
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:20,423
Okay.

286
00:20:21,818 --> 00:20:23,896
- Put her in the brig.
- What?

287
00:20:24,344 --> 00:20:27,915
So some things don't add up, and
we're back to thinking she's a Cylon?

288
00:20:28,085 --> 00:20:31,570
- What about Cottle's test?
- Cottle's test doesn't prove anything.

289
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,727
Even if her DNA's the same,
she could still be a Cylon.

290
00:20:34,988 --> 00:20:37,110
She could've been one
from the beginning.

291
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,591
Baltar's Cylon detector was a crock.

292
00:20:39,761 --> 00:20:41,545
It failed to i.d. Boomer.

293
00:20:44,342 --> 00:20:47,241
I know how you feel about her, Bill,

294
00:20:47,502 --> 00:20:50,285
but that is exactly what the Cylons
could be counting on here.

295
00:20:50,746 --> 00:20:52,926
We're back where we started from.

296
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:57,083
Could be Cylons right here, we wouldn't
know till they put a bullet in our head.

297
00:20:57,344 --> 00:20:59,336
Or lead us into an ambush.

298
00:20:59,546 --> 00:21:02,222
That cylon fleet had enough firepower
to blow us out of the sky,

299
00:21:02,432 --> 00:21:04,530
but instead they ran and jumped.

300
00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:09,555
And there's Kara Thrace suddenly
back from the dead having found Earth.

301
00:21:10,126 --> 00:21:12,187
If Kara Thrace
can lead us off our course...

302
00:21:12,357 --> 00:21:13,724
Course? What course?

303
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,187
The nebula was supposed to be another
clue on the way to Earth, but it...

304
00:21:17,357 --> 00:21:18,602
The nebula

305
00:21:18,772 --> 00:21:21,410
is only a road sign
along the way to Earth.

306
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,283
And we need to continue
to follow its path.

307
00:21:25,098 --> 00:21:26,698
Well, what if Kara

308
00:21:27,767 --> 00:21:30,499
is the clue
that we were supposed to find?

309
00:21:31,303 --> 00:21:32,851
And what if she's playing you?

310
00:21:33,021 --> 00:21:35,792
And what if she's playing you?
And all of us?

311
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:45,146
Gaius, please!

312
00:21:46,337 --> 00:21:48,464
Gaius, please, can you help me?

313
00:21:49,777 --> 00:21:51,027
What's going on?

314
00:21:51,481 --> 00:21:53,312
- Oh, god...
- Watch his head.

315
00:21:53,482 --> 00:21:55,100
- It's Derek.
- Derek, is it?

316
00:22:00,776 --> 00:22:03,221
Derek, I see. Where are my clothes?

317
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,281
- It's okay.
- Is it?

318
00:22:10,573 --> 00:22:13,934
- Did they give you a diagnosis?
- They said he's got...

319
00:22:14,391 --> 00:22:16,246
- viral encephalitis.
- Viral?

320
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:19,329
I don't know,
it's some inflammation of the brain.

321
00:22:19,499 --> 00:22:22,377
- Can't the doctors do something?
- Well, not if it's viral, no.

322
00:22:22,719 --> 00:22:24,338
I'm afraid it's up to

323
00:22:24,598 --> 00:22:26,346
Derek's immune system.

324
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:28,633
And he has to be strong.

325
00:22:28,753 --> 00:22:30,995
And we have to be strong for him.

326
00:22:31,604 --> 00:22:34,511
I didn't want him to die
in that sickbay, so...

327
00:22:35,618 --> 00:22:37,239
So I brought him here.

328
00:22:38,154 --> 00:22:39,704
So he can be with us.

329
00:22:40,211 --> 00:22:41,311
All of us.

330
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:44,844
- Yeah, all of us.
- Give me your hand, please.

331
00:22:48,807 --> 00:22:50,216
I wish there was...

332
00:22:51,978 --> 00:22:53,951
You know I prayed for him, don't you?

333
00:22:54,502 --> 00:22:56,350
- I know.
- I prayed for him.

334
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,469
I know.

335
00:22:57,953 --> 00:22:58,956
I guess...

336
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:03,168
I guess that the one true god
just doesn't want him to live, right?

337
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,644
Anybody still hearing
that frakkin' song?

338
00:23:34,762 --> 00:23:35,574
Nope.

339
00:23:38,432 --> 00:23:41,089
Maybe it stopped
when we figured out who...

340
00:23:41,578 --> 00:23:42,628
What we are.

341
00:23:44,293 --> 00:23:46,690
Could have been some kind of trigger?

342
00:23:47,908 --> 00:23:49,503
To switch us on?

343
00:23:50,392 --> 00:23:53,707
You know, after that raider
scanned me with that red light,

344
00:23:53,877 --> 00:23:55,566
damn thing just cut and ran.

345
00:23:55,736 --> 00:23:56,963
They all did.

346
00:23:58,034 --> 00:24:00,004
You think it recognized you as a Cylon?

347
00:24:00,174 --> 00:24:01,398
I don't know.

348
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:05,719
Maybe that's why it didn't shoot me.
More important,

349
00:24:05,889 --> 00:24:07,190
why didn't I shoot him?

350
00:24:07,736 --> 00:24:10,914
Racetrack was right.
You just made a dumb nugget mistake.

351
00:24:11,034 --> 00:24:11,862
Did I?

352
00:24:12,937 --> 00:24:15,573
Maybe I was programmed
to leave my gun safeties on.

353
00:24:15,976 --> 00:24:18,786
Those bastards can't program me
to help them.

354
00:24:20,095 --> 00:24:21,024
No way.

355
00:24:21,936 --> 00:24:23,497
Boomer thought the same thing.

356
00:24:26,218 --> 00:24:30,149
- And then she shot the old man.
- Boomer didn't know what she was.

357
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:31,319
We do.

358
00:24:32,425 --> 00:24:34,190
That is not gonna happen.

359
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:47,147
Agreed?

360
00:25:03,207 --> 00:25:04,956
I don't know why I'm here.

361
00:25:11,741 --> 00:25:12,732
Yes, I do.

362
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:19,012
I'm here because of the things
that we've shared

363
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:22,483
- and the things that we've seen...
- The visions in the opera house.

364
00:25:22,653 --> 00:25:24,909
You went inside.
You saw more than I did.

365
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:27,145
I thought that maybe you could help me.

366
00:25:27,576 --> 00:25:28,769
Help you how?

367
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,482
I need to know about the other five.

368
00:25:31,836 --> 00:25:33,710
The types we've never seen.

369
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:36,920
The ones that

370
00:25:37,245 --> 00:25:39,574
Baltar calls the final five.

371
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,953
And you want to know
if Kara Thrace is one of them.

372
00:25:44,064 --> 00:25:44,922
Yes.

373
00:25:48,057 --> 00:25:50,922
I've been programmed
never to think about them.

374
00:25:51,092 --> 00:25:52,797
Well, your programming isn't working,

375
00:25:52,967 --> 00:25:55,717
because you're thinking about them
right now.

376
00:25:56,331 --> 00:25:57,523
I try not to.

377
00:25:57,693 --> 00:26:01,543
Trying not to is thinking about them.
How do you rationalize that?

378
00:26:06,728 --> 00:26:07,961
All right, no.

379
00:26:08,586 --> 00:26:10,668
Back off. Don't leave, back off.

380
00:26:13,748 --> 00:26:15,067
The five are close.

381
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:18,196
What?

382
00:26:18,754 --> 00:26:20,055
I can feel them.

383
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,059
What about this one?

384
00:26:26,393 --> 00:26:28,344
It's a protoplanetary system.

385
00:26:28,786 --> 00:26:29,643
So?

386
00:26:30,532 --> 00:26:31,848
Nothing but rocks.

387
00:26:32,018 --> 00:26:34,753
No ringed gas giants
like you claimed you saw.

388
00:26:35,155 --> 00:26:38,048
- I did see it, lieutenant.
- If you say so, sir.

389
00:26:38,259 --> 00:26:41,024
- And what are you saying, Mr. Gaeta?
- I'm not saying anything, sir.

390
00:26:41,144 --> 00:26:44,505
- I'm just following orders.
- Well, I'm ordering you to help me.

391
00:26:44,675 --> 00:26:47,662
- You're ordering me...
- Mr. Gaeta, take a break.

392
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:49,811
With pleasure, sir.

393
00:26:50,213 --> 00:26:52,696
Jump clock is running, Dee.
Take us out of here.

394
00:26:52,866 --> 00:26:53,887
Yes, sir.

395
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:55,924
What's going on?

396
00:26:57,485 --> 00:26:59,115
I see it on his face.

397
00:27:00,442 --> 00:27:03,271
On all of their faces.
They don't believe me.

398
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:10,215
You want people to believe you?

399
00:27:10,923 --> 00:27:12,573
Find that star system.

400
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:14,850
It's a big waste of time.

401
00:27:15,103 --> 00:27:18,879
We've only been at it a few hours.
Found maybe a dozen trinaries.

402
00:27:19,049 --> 00:27:21,843
- Baltar's calculations took months.
- It doesn't work like that.

403
00:27:22,547 --> 00:27:24,275
How does it work, Kara?

404
00:27:27,486 --> 00:27:28,834
It's a feeling.

405
00:27:30,191 --> 00:27:31,458
An intuition.

406
00:27:31,791 --> 00:27:34,884
I didn't use nav fixes
to get there and back.

407
00:27:35,215 --> 00:27:37,867
When we were at that nebula,
it was so clear to me.

408
00:27:37,987 --> 00:27:41,321
But every jump we take farther away,
the clarity fades.

409
00:27:41,612 --> 00:27:45,643
If we keep jumping like this,
I won't be able to find our way back.

410
00:27:46,436 --> 00:27:47,377
That'll be all.

411
00:27:48,674 --> 00:27:51,464
All hands, prepare for jump in ten...

412
00:27:51,778 --> 00:27:53,604
The President's adamant.

413
00:27:53,774 --> 00:27:56,761
We're gonna continue on the course
laid out by the Eye of Jupiter.

414
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:58,089
<i>Five,</i>

415
00:27:58,631 --> 00:27:59,457
<i>four,</i>

416
00:27:59,627 --> 00:28:00,548
<i>three,</i>

417
00:28:00,758 --> 00:28:02,017
<i>two, jump.</i>

418
00:28:08,198 --> 00:28:09,926
We're going the wrong way.

419
00:28:11,829 --> 00:28:14,005
If we keep jumping,
I'll lose the feeling completely

420
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:16,078
and I'll never be able to take us back.

421
00:28:17,224 --> 00:28:18,825
What do you want me to do?

422
00:28:21,073 --> 00:28:23,283
You want me to go to Laura Roslin,

423
00:28:23,403 --> 00:28:26,633
tell her forget Pythia
and the Eye of Jupiter, because Kara

424
00:28:26,753 --> 00:28:28,722
has some feeling about where Earth is?

425
00:28:28,842 --> 00:28:29,645
Yes.

426
00:28:32,686 --> 00:28:33,674
I can't.

427
00:28:35,397 --> 00:28:37,127
I just left your ship.

428
00:28:38,182 --> 00:28:39,942
There's not a scratch on it.

429
00:28:40,987 --> 00:28:42,268
It's brand-new.

430
00:28:46,229 --> 00:28:48,129
How do you explain that, Kara?

431
00:28:53,985 --> 00:28:55,130
Look at me.

432
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,206
Look at me!

433
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,686
I swear to Gods...

434
00:29:03,323 --> 00:29:04,898
It's me, Kara.

435
00:29:06,523 --> 00:29:07,793
I can do this.

436
00:29:11,586 --> 00:29:13,214
You said you loved me
like a daughter.

437
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:15,715
If you still do,
you've gotta trust me on this one.

438
00:29:20,894 --> 00:29:22,244
I can't afford to.

439
00:29:35,311 --> 00:29:37,010
<i>They're waiting for me.</i>

440
00:29:37,696 --> 00:29:39,161
<i>No! No!</i>

441
00:29:39,574 --> 00:29:41,199
<i>They're waiting for me.</i>

442
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:43,901
<i>No! No!</i>

443
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,634
What should I believe?

444
00:29:47,024 --> 00:29:48,752
Should I believe my heart?

445
00:29:48,872 --> 00:29:50,161
Or my eyes?

446
00:29:54,913 --> 00:29:56,720
Well, you know where I stand.

447
00:30:00,484 --> 00:30:02,101
I want to believe her.

448
00:30:02,981 --> 00:30:04,695
But the President's right.

449
00:30:05,253 --> 00:30:07,559
It's exactly what the Cylons
would be counting on.

450
00:30:07,948 --> 00:30:09,602
So I guess you're not changing course.

451
00:30:09,762 --> 00:30:12,585
For the time being,
we follow the President's lead.

452
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:17,020
She's still staying in your quarters?

453
00:30:17,687 --> 00:30:19,903
Just till we find a place to put her up,

454
00:30:20,422 --> 00:30:22,485
to finish the rest
of her Doloxan treatment.

455
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:31,499
I want to thank you
for suiting up during the fight.

456
00:30:34,162 --> 00:30:36,059
We needed everyone up there.

457
00:30:44,661 --> 00:30:45,742
We still do.

458
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:54,190
I took those off for the wrong reasons.

459
00:30:54,766 --> 00:30:56,122
Put them back on.

460
00:30:57,769 --> 00:31:00,680
Baltar's trial
may have been the trigger, but...

461
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,190
This is a feeling
I've been having for a while.

462
00:31:11,007 --> 00:31:12,551
It's time for a change.

463
00:31:13,862 --> 00:31:14,918
I need to move on.

464
00:31:18,234 --> 00:31:20,612
I've had some feelers
from the government.

465
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,303
There's a position opening up.

466
00:31:26,199 --> 00:31:29,087
And I think I can make
a valuable contribution there.

467
00:31:30,817 --> 00:31:32,477
Maybe even more than in the cockpit.

468
00:31:43,757 --> 00:31:46,565
Dad, what if Zak
had come back to us in that Viper?

469
00:31:48,604 --> 00:31:51,359
If my brother
had climbed out of that cockpit...

470
00:31:54,148 --> 00:31:56,424
Would it matter if he were a Cylon?

471
00:31:58,547 --> 00:32:00,099
If he always had been?

472
00:32:02,746 --> 00:32:04,460
When all's said and done...

473
00:32:06,327 --> 00:32:09,353
would that change
how we really feel about him?

474
00:33:04,106 --> 00:33:05,195
Please, God.

475
00:33:08,664 --> 00:33:11,248
I'm only asking you this one last time.

476
00:33:14,032 --> 00:33:15,807
Don't let this child die.

477
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:23,457
Has he sinned against you?
He can't have sinned against you.

478
00:33:25,216 --> 00:33:27,100
He's not even had a life yet.

479
00:33:28,649 --> 00:33:30,872
How can you take him and let me live?

480
00:33:33,038 --> 00:33:34,428
After all I've done.

481
00:33:35,884 --> 00:33:38,077
Really, if you want someone to suffer,

482
00:33:38,893 --> 00:33:39,820
take me.

483
00:33:42,334 --> 00:33:44,125
We both know I deserve it.

484
00:33:47,137 --> 00:33:48,881
I have been selfish

485
00:33:49,604 --> 00:33:50,644
and weak.

486
00:33:50,982 --> 00:33:52,912
I have failed so many people.

487
00:33:55,203 --> 00:33:56,863
And I have killed.

488
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:01,622
I'm not asking for your forgiveness.

489
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,009
I'm just asking

490
00:34:06,523 --> 00:34:09,445
that you spare the life
of this innocent child.

491
00:34:12,797 --> 00:34:14,175
Don't take him.

492
00:34:15,016 --> 00:34:15,984
Take me.

493
00:34:16,779 --> 00:34:18,687
Take me, take me please.

494
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:37,453
We were all very moved
by the way you prayed for Derek.

495
00:34:37,573 --> 00:34:38,869
Fat lot of good it did him.

496
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:41,758
Unfortunately, he's worse,
if you hadn't realized.

497
00:34:42,229 --> 00:34:44,329
Doesn't mean God didn't hear you.

498
00:34:44,785 --> 00:34:47,086
I'm sure he's looking
after Derek's immortal soul.

499
00:34:47,206 --> 00:34:50,592
Yes, I wish I shared your confidence
on that one. I really do.

500
00:34:51,326 --> 00:34:53,766
But you have to keep the faith.

501
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:57,814
- We all look to you for guidance...
- Well, you shouldn't, should you?

502
00:34:57,984 --> 00:34:59,534
I mean, you're just...

503
00:35:02,487 --> 00:35:04,305
Well, you're very young and...

504
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,350
What are we doing here exactly?

505
00:35:29,986 --> 00:35:31,096
Thank you.

506
00:35:38,753 --> 00:35:40,073
Mr. President.

507
00:35:42,195 --> 00:35:43,523
Gaius, let's go.

508
00:35:47,725 --> 00:35:50,551
- We should get back, okay?
- Good to see you again.

509
00:35:53,642 --> 00:35:55,326
I'm sorry. I can't...

510
00:35:55,565 --> 00:35:58,284
We met at the groundbreaking ceremony
on New Caprica.

511
00:35:59,456 --> 00:36:01,405
Introduced you to my son Kevin.

512
00:36:01,525 --> 00:36:03,833
He told you he wanted to be President
when he grew up.

513
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:07,445
You told him that he could be
if he stuck to his schoolwork.

514
00:36:08,962 --> 00:36:11,094
He's a redhead little boy, isn't he?

515
00:36:11,912 --> 00:36:14,262
- About eight or nine years old...
- Seven.

516
00:36:14,382 --> 00:36:15,795
Seven years old.

517
00:36:19,483 --> 00:36:20,533
How is...

518
00:36:21,447 --> 00:36:22,391
Kevin.

519
00:36:22,551 --> 00:36:23,915
- How is he?
- He's dead.

520
00:36:25,288 --> 00:36:28,927
- Your police shot him.
- Come on, Gaius, let's get out of here.

521
00:36:35,031 --> 00:36:36,613
- Leave her alone!
- Look at me!

522
00:36:36,733 --> 00:36:38,451
- Leave her alone!
- Look at me!

523
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:46,840
Go on, scream.

524
00:36:47,774 --> 00:36:48,940
Come on, scream!

525
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:51,700
I want to see
if anyone comes to help you.

526
00:36:52,601 --> 00:36:53,548
Scream!

527
00:36:58,147 --> 00:36:59,150
Beg.

528
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,477
I bet you begged the Cylons.
Why don't you beg for me?

529
00:37:02,597 --> 00:37:03,870
Come on, beg!

530
00:37:05,004 --> 00:37:06,842
Get up! Get on your knees!

531
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,129
Get up!

532
00:37:12,121 --> 00:37:14,979
You asked God to take your life
instead of the boy's.

533
00:37:15,521 --> 00:37:16,521
Did you mean it?

534
00:37:16,833 --> 00:37:17,633
Yes.

535
00:37:18,971 --> 00:37:19,870
Do it.

536
00:37:20,971 --> 00:37:22,187
Take my life.

537
00:37:23,329 --> 00:37:24,253
Please.

538
00:37:29,259 --> 00:37:30,168
Please.

539
00:37:33,464 --> 00:37:35,170
Please take my life.

540
00:37:53,007 --> 00:37:55,842
You see?
Gaius, I knew God wouldn't desert you.

541
00:37:56,299 --> 00:38:00,092
I felt his love course through me,
giving me the strength to smite them.

542
00:38:00,328 --> 00:38:03,492
Less smiting next time, unless you want
to be held up on murder charges.

543
00:38:07,682 --> 00:38:10,067
- Gaius!
- You two, watch the door.

544
00:38:12,027 --> 00:38:13,430
Are you all right?

545
00:38:14,677 --> 00:38:16,386
I cut myself shaving.

546
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:20,761
Well, you have to come.
You have to come and see Derek.

547
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:23,967
- Derek? Derek, yes.
- God answered your prayers.

548
00:38:24,087 --> 00:38:26,517
- What?
- You have to see. Look.

549
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:29,897
Look at him.

550
00:38:41,737 --> 00:38:43,971
- And no trace of a fever.
- No.

551
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,362
It's a miracle.

552
00:39:21,048 --> 00:39:22,659
No one took it down.

553
00:39:24,291 --> 00:39:26,354
Not the old man, not Lee.

554
00:39:27,383 --> 00:39:28,904
Not even you, Sam.

555
00:39:29,661 --> 00:39:31,516
You just got back, Kara.

556
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:35,326
We're trying to get a handle on this.
You gotta cut people some slack.

557
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,996
Cut yourself some too.

558
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:43,079
When I...

559
00:39:43,789 --> 00:39:47,164
woke up orbiting earth, I just figured
it was some crazy dream, but...

560
00:39:50,277 --> 00:39:53,929
I went in following a Heavy Raider.

561
00:39:57,533 --> 00:40:00,246
I mean, maybe the Cylons
pulled me out of the soup,

562
00:40:00,366 --> 00:40:01,902
captured me, brainwashed me.

563
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:04,390
On Caprica,

564
00:40:04,591 --> 00:40:06,835
when they experiment on me,

565
00:40:06,955 --> 00:40:11,036
did they take pieces of me?
Is it possible that they grew me,

566
00:40:11,156 --> 00:40:12,801
another me in a petri dish,

567
00:40:12,971 --> 00:40:15,308
or they embedded me with the memories

568
00:40:15,428 --> 00:40:17,428
or it with the memories, or...

569
00:40:18,843 --> 00:40:19,879
I don't know.

570
00:40:23,209 --> 00:40:24,222
Kara, no.

571
00:40:24,662 --> 00:40:25,801
Listen to me.

572
00:40:26,712 --> 00:40:28,367
If you were a Cylon,

573
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:31,015
then you've been one from the beginning.

574
00:40:32,545 --> 00:40:33,688
Like Boomer.

575
00:40:34,586 --> 00:40:36,687
Spend my entire life
thinking I'm one thing...

576
00:40:36,847 --> 00:40:40,382
Yeah, and then you wake up one day
and discover you're another.

577
00:40:41,386 --> 00:40:43,948
It still doesn't change
who you really are.

578
00:40:44,664 --> 00:40:46,923
It still doesn't change the fact

579
00:40:47,437 --> 00:40:49,817
that I love you no matter what.

580
00:40:52,015 --> 00:40:53,937
You are a better person than I am, Sam,

581
00:40:54,057 --> 00:40:56,600
because if I found out
that you were a Cylon,

582
00:40:57,863 --> 00:41:00,164
I would put a bullet between your eyes.

583
00:41:00,842 --> 00:41:02,628
<i>All hands, prepare for jump</i>

584
00:41:02,798 --> 00:41:04,790
<i>in four, three,</i>

585
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:06,159
<i>two,</i>

586
00:41:10,084 --> 00:41:12,671
Damn it, they're still going
in the wrong direction.

587
00:41:14,441 --> 00:41:16,784
One more jump
and I'm gonna lose my way altogether.

588
00:41:16,904 --> 00:41:19,518
All right, we gotta find you a rack.
Okay, take it easy.

589
00:41:21,149 --> 00:41:24,985
It's Roslin. The old man is not
gonna listen to me as long as she's...

590
00:41:26,897 --> 00:41:28,856
- I gotta get to her.
- You can't do that.

591
00:41:29,425 --> 00:41:31,193
- Is that a fact?
- Yeah.

592
00:41:33,149 --> 00:41:34,472
No, no, wait!

593
00:41:38,885 --> 00:41:40,618
What the hell are you doing, Kara?

594
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:43,009
Where's the president, Sam?

595
00:41:44,144 --> 00:41:45,164
Kara, come on.

596
00:42:54,355 --> 00:42:58,160
 - =( Team Lords of Kobol )= -
