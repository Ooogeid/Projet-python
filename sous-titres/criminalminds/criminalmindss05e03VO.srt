00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:04,260
Just stop.

3
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:05,400
I get it.

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,160
That's why allison
is with you.

5
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,100
Oh, god.

6
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,560
I am dealing with it.

7
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,530
Ben!

8
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,100
Well, you took her
from me, remember?

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,560
Ben, i thought
you paid the bill.

10
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,300
What are you doing?

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,630
Ben?

12
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:49,160
[door creaking]

00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,560

14
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,500
Aah!

00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,860
Any closer
and the image will distort.

How is jack?

18
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,730
He's real smart.

19
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,530
Great kid.

20
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,060
Haley?

21
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:28,500
To be honest, we're moving
them to a halfway house.

22
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,330
I thought you had found
a permanent location.

23
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,930
Haley made a number of
phone calls to her mother.

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,430
It's all good,
but to be safe,

25
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,660
We have to move them.

26
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,330
Sam, thank you.

27
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,500
I promise you,

28
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,030
No harm will come to them.

29
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,400
You just concentrate
on getting foyet.

30
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,800
Happy birthday, buddy.

32
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,360
You got a second?

33
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,130
Sure, what is it?

34
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,800
A case just came in.

35
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,760
I'll be right there.

36
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,300
Actually,
i need to talk to you.

37
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,530
It's on commack, long island.

38
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,730
That's your home town.

39
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,000
Yeah. and if it's ok,

40
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,800
I'd rather stay behind.

41
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,800
Why?

42
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,900
It was a different life,

43
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,630
One i left 30 years ago.

44
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,060
I'm in no hurry
to go back.

45
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,030
Well...

46
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,060
Any other day,
i'd say stay,

47
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,730
But i just became
aware of this.

48
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,530
What have we got?

49
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,230
Ben vanderwaal was killed
in commack, long island,

50
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,930
Last night,
shot at close range,

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,900
Once in the heart,
once in the head,

52
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,460
.22 caliber shell.

53
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,000
They found hair
and blood traces

54
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,700
From ben vanderwaal's
wife heather.

55
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,730
But not heather?

56
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,430
No, she's still missing,
presumed dead.

57
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,830
The caliber and placement
of the bullets

58
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,500
Match that
of two previous victims.

59
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,030
The first, rita haslat.

60
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,230
8 months ago she went
missing from her home
in new jersey.

61
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,630
4 weeks later, she was
found in a trash bin.

62
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,330
She went from that to this
in under 3 weeks?

63
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,130
She's totally emaciated.

64
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,400
Ligature marks
on her wrists and ankles

65
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,960
Indicate
she was constrained.

66
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:22,360
One in the heart,
one in the head--
same as vanderwaal.

67
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,630
Sounds more like
an execution.

68
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,830
Then why cut off
vanderwaal's
hands postmortem?

69
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,000
What about the third victim?

70
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,660
Bill levington.

71
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,060
His appearance
was certainly altered.

72
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,700
His genitals were missing.

73
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,760
Though the method
of mutilation is
different in each crime,

74
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:39,030
Clearly there's a signature.
the question is, what?

75
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,300
Wheels-up in 20 minutes.

76
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,900
What's this?

77
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,530
You told me you were cleared
to travel. you lied.

78
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,460
Naughty boy.

79
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:45,960
Uh, no, i didn't.

80
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,560
I am a doctor, so technically,
i wasn't a lie.

81
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,700
What was it, then?

82
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,930
Um...second opinion.

83
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,300
Hmm. you're my bitch now.

84
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,900

Blaise pascal.

89
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,630
In the ben vanderwaal case,

90
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,060
His hands were taken.

91
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,930
Uh, bill levington,
his genitals.

92
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,530
Only in the rita haslat case
she was starved and tortured,

93
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,660
Then executed,

94
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:26,400
And there's no sign of
postmortem mutilation.

95
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,330
Why would he take
heather vanderwaal

96
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,330
And not simply kill her?

97
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,930
Maybe he hasn't
and she's still alive.

98
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,400
The only thing concrete
is the m.o.,

99
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,300
Which depicts an efficient
no-nonsense murderer.

100
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,730
Well, then
we need to figure out

101
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,460
What each act of mutilation
means to the unsub.

102
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,300
Or to the victim.

103
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,200
It's pretty much
how we found it.

104
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,200
There's no signs
of forced entry.

105
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,730
It says in the file
that heather vanderwaal
has a daughter.

106
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,930
Where is she?

107
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,360
She moved to san diego
to live with her real father.

108
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,560
Ben and heather vanderwaal

109
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,660
Have only been married
a couple of years.

110
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,530
So heather came in,
she dropped her shopping bags,

111
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,230
Her cell phone, and her keys,
but not her coat.

112
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,260
She turns on the lights.

113
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,730
But they didn't work,

114
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,030
Because the phone and
the ectricity were cut.

115
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,260
Something in this room
attracted her attention.

116
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,230
What is it?

117
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,900
Marks in the blood
look like a camera tripod.

118
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,530
Serial killers,
especially sexual sadists,

119
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,060
Often document their kill.

120
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:21,030
But sexual sadists usually
torture their victims

121
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,160
While they're still alive.

122
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,730
You still didn't find
any conflicting dna?

123
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,630
No. no prints,
no fibers, nothing.

124
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,830
Nobody heard any shots?

125
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,900
[cell phone rings]
no. oh, excuse me.

126
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,600
Yeah?

127
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,230
All right.

128
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,060
Heather vanderwaal
was just found

129
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,460

half hour ago.

130
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,260
She's at brookside general.

131
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,160
Get jj over there.

132
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:44,030
A killer this sophisticated
doesn't leave a living witness

133
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,530
Without a reason.

134
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,430
Heather, my name is
agent jareau.

135
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,800
I have some questions
for you.

136
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,360
So you came home,

137
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,130
You tried to turn
the lights on,

138
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,600
But they didn't work.

139
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,930
What did you do next?

140
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,360
I saw a light.

141
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,060
A flash.

142
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:16,800
I opened the door,

143
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,830
And ben was there,

144
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,930
Tied to a chair.

145
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,800
I think he was dead.

146
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,060
There was another flash.

147
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,260
It blinded me
for a moment.

148
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:29,500
Did you see your attacker?

149
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,560
No.

150
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,130
Did he say anything?

151
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,330
No.

152
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,660
I heard this noise.

153
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,430
What kind of noise?

154
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,430
Sawing.

155
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:46,860
I watched him cut off
ben's hand.

156
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,000
Why didn't he kill me?

00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,030

We've been getting to know
heather vanderwaal.

00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,900
I can't tell you
her favorite beatle,

163
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,830
<i>but i can tell you
she was living la vida unhappy.</i>

164
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,930
What did you find?

165
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,530
Reid: her ex-husband
took her daughter allison

166
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,160
Out of school mid-term.
after that, heather cut
a check for $5,000

167
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,630
To a place called
lewis, bell, & peters

168
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,630
6 days ago.

Mrs. vanderwaal...

173
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,830
At mid-term you moved
your daughter out of school?

174
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,030
Yes, i did.

175
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,500
After that, you filed
for divorce from ben.

176
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,900
This man left you alive
for a reason.

177
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,030
I need to know if these
two things are connected.

178
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,500
A few months ago,

179
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,860
I found a picture of allison
on ben's phone.

180
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:54,860
Your daughter.

181
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,800
She was naked.

182
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,030
Where was it taken?

183
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,260
I couldn't tell.

184
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,730
Did you confront him?

185
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,400
Yes. he claimed that

186
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:06,060
Allison sent it
to him by mistake.

187
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:09,500
She meant to send it
to another student
at her school.

188
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,530
It's called sexting.

189
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,200
What did allison say?

190
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,630
She said ben took it,

191
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,660
But she--she lies.

192
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,460
Allison, she's a liar.

193
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:23,600
She caused us a lot
of trouble, you know?

194
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:26,500
She wasn't lying about this,
though, was she?

195
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,430
No.

196
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,430
[crying]

197
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,630
The hand removal
is less than surgical.

198
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,860
He used a basic
double-toothed saw.

199
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:45,730
So, the guy
we're looking for

200
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,400
Has no medical
training.

201
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,930
Not the kind i've had.

202
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,630
One in the heart,
one in the brain, close range.

203
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,500
The second one
was right up behind the ear.

204
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,930
How about gunshot residue?

205
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,330
Surprisingly little.

206
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,060
Maybe it's because the killer
was using a .22.

207
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:05,360
Small caliber, small discharge.

208
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,900
Hmm.

209
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,960
What is it?

210
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,930
Ballistics can't match
the bullets to a gun.

211
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,530
There were no rifling marks
on the bullet.

212
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,400
There's only one
explanation for that.

213
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,860
Well, if anyone had a motive
to kill ben vanderwaal,

214
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,260
It was heather's ex-husband.

215
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,600
But he was in san diego,
and he has no connection

216
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,060
To the other two victims.

217
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,160
David rossi,
we finally get to meet.

218
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,660
Detective gil hardesty.
very, very nice
to have you with us.

219
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,230
Hotch: morgan,
what did you find?

220
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,500
In all cases,
the .22 caliber bullets
had no rifling marks.

221
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,230
And without the barrel
being rifled,

222
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,200
The bullets would have
very little velocity.

223
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,960
He would have to shoot
his vi pointblank.

224
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,330
Jj. this guy's using
a zip gun.

225
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,900
Now, if you know
what you're doing,
a piece of plumbing

226
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,960
Or a kid's bicycle pump
can be turned into a gun.

227
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,560
Rossi: one in the heart,
one in the head.

228
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:49,630
Untraceable, expandable
bullets tell me
without question,

229
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,930
All of these kills
were strictly business.

230
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,260
A hitman?

231
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,960
What about the postmortem
mutilation?

232
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,530
A contract sometimes
includes extras.

233
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,400
The camera is not
for sexual gratification,
it's for proof of death.

234
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,000
So we could be looking
for two people?

235
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,900
Maybe. maybe more.

236
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,330
Excuse me.

237
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,560
I may be able to hit on
some old contacts,

238
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,560
But i'll need to do it alone.

239
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:10,830
Contacts?

240
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,660
Do we want to know?

241
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,630
Best not.

242
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,030
[tv, indistinct]

243
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,730
[irish accent]
we don't open till 5:30.

244
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,030
I'm looking for the owner
of that coat.

245
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,660
Is that right?

246
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,700
Not with that you're not.

247
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:43,760
Check out the front
and back.

248
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:47,830
You're either a dead man
or a cop. which one is it?

249
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,560
Right now i'm just
an old friend.

250
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:55,300
You gave up that right
the day you became a fed.

251
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,060
Ray?

252
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,500
David.

253
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,000
I thought you retired.

254
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:16,370
Writing books?

255
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,540
What can i tell you, ray?

256
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,340
Some habits
are hard to break.

257
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,040
I try this damn puzzle
every morning.

258
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,800
Never gets any easier.

259
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,500
"crater creator."

260
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:29,900
You know,
i work with a kid

261
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:31,900
Who can solve this whole
thing in 5 minutes.

262
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,970
He must be smarter
than both of us.

263
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,140
That's for sure.

264
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,940
So what's it been,
30 years?

265
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,070
33.

266
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,670
You know, i thought
at the very least

267
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,970
I would see you
at emma's funeral.

268
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,200
I, um...
need to ask you a favor.

269
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:51,370
She loved you
as much as you loved her.

270
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,340
Hey, ambition's a bitch,
ain't it?

271
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,140
I'm not here
to talk about emma.

272
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,740
What are you here
to talk about?

273
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,900
You've read the news?

274
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,800
You think i got something
to do with that?

275
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,870
You should
stick to writing books.

276
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,470
This guy is real specific.

277
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,840
He uses a zip gun
and then throws in extras.

278
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:11,570
For a smart guy,
your coming back here
was a real dumb move.

279
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,840
Not as dumb as the one
that sean made.

280
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,070
He's on trial for
the transportation
of weapons,

281
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,440
No doubt for you.

282
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,400
And what about the rico beef
hanging over your head?

283
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:26,140
You help me,

284
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,140
And you'll be assisting
a federal investigation.

285
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,170
[chuckles] and what exactly
is that gonna do
for my reputation?

286
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,770
If you don't,

287
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,300
You may not have one
to protect.

288
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,400
Our organized crime unit
is very close

289
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:41,500
To shutting you down
permanently.

290
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,970
Keep talking.

291
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,640
The removal of the hands
is as specific

292
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,240
As rita haslat's condition
was when she was found.

293
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,270
Just as specific as the removal
of bill levington's genitals.

294
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,170
There's a message
in the mutilations

295
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,500
The unsub
wants us to know.

296
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,800
I got something here
that might help us with--

297
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,800
Technically, we have
something here that
might help with that.

298
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,770
Bill levington was involved
in a serial rape case,

299
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,040
All involving minors,
and it never went to trial.

300
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,040
Rita haslat?

301
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,170
A former social worker,
a former--

302
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,500
Attained said former
status

303
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:10,800
When she was fired
from the dcfs for
gross negligence.

304
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:13,640
In one of her cases,
a 7-year-old boy
starved to death.

305
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,340
Prentiss: which explains
why haslat was so emaciated
when she was found.

306
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,270
If all the victims
were indicated in crimes
against children,

307
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,140
Then we've found
a connection.

308
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,540
One of the unsubs has access
to the crimes of the victims

309
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,870
And probably works
in the justice system. garcia?

310
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,370
On it. what?
on it.

311
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,200
All right, well,
we know what the victims
have in common,

312
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:30,340
We just need to find out
who they have in common.

313
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,200
Wait. this social worker
and the suspected rape case,

314
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,640
Those were
matters of record.

315
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,740
Ben vanderwaal's relationship
with his stepdaughter is not.

316
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,570
Unless the stepdaughter
told someone else.

317
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,740
I'll call rossi.

318
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,370
I'll have the daughter
brought in.

319
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,040
And all 3 crimes
were against children?

320
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,270
Ok. thanks, prentiss.

321
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,340
Cuban, no doubt.

322
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,500
Mm.

323
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:56,840
Contraband?

324
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:00,340
Some laws
are just plain unjust.

325
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,570
You know, those 3 individuals
messed with kids.

326
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,840
They got what they deserve.

327
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:09,900
That all depends on
your definition of justice.

328
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,870
It's the same as when
we were kids.

329
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:15,000
You do what you gotta do
to survive.

330
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:17,200
What about this guy?

331
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,740
Yeah.

332
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,840
There's only one guy
that's this specific.

333
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,570
Name?

334
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,440
Bosola.

335
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,370
I spoke to heather last night.

336
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,000
I knew for a long time
something was off, but this--

337
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:40,440
Why didn't you tell me?

338
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,970
Mr. sandweiss,
allison is the victim here.

339
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,440
I just want to know
the truth from her,
for once.

340
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,900
I told you,
i don't know what
they're talking about.

341
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:54,300
Allison, we have the pictures
your stepfather took of you.

342
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:55,940
Sandweiss: allison...

343
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,770
He was always home
before mom.

344
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,400
We just talked
at first.

345
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,870
Why didn't you
tell your mom?

346
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,600
I knew she'd tell dad,
and he always said
he'd kill anyone

347
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,470
Who laid a hand on me.

348
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,470
And did he?

349
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,770
How long has he
been operating?

350
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,440
20 years.

351
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,270
He's a ghost.

352
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,000
I've heard that name.

353
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,770
Bosola.

354
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,170
He's a character in a play.

355
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,740
<i>jacobean tragedy called
the duchess of malfi.</i>

356
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,400
Bosola brutally slays
the duchess.

357
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,870
It wouldn't be a tragedy
if he didn't.

358
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,270
Is he local?

359
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:43,040
I don't care
about the rico beef.

360
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,070
What about sean?

361
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,470
Federal prison, out in 2.

362
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,240
All right.

363
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:02,000
I'll bring you bosola
tonight.

364
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:04,340
You better bring
the marine corps.

365
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,670
Allison, did you ever
tell anyone

366
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:13,300
About what your stepfather
was doing?

367
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:15,800
I told my therapist.

368
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:20,570
He said i act out
because i crave attention.

369
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,240
I'm so sorry, daddy.

370
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,740
You have nothing
to be sorry for.

371
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,800
We need his name,
please.

372
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,400
Your therapist.

373
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,970
Sandweiss: jerry sorum.

374
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,640
Am i a suspect?

375
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,500
Not yet, mr. sorum.

376
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:39,800
What is your professional
opinion of allison?

377
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,800
You mean was she
sexually abused
by her stepfather?

378
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:42,900
No question.

379
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,040
And you reported it.

380
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,370
Of course.

381
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,040
To the police?

382
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,040
Absolutely.

383
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,840
Morgan:
how far did they take it?

384
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,370
They had it reviewed
by the state.

385
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,200
Did the police interview her?

386
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,370
They came to my office.

387
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,970
Allison wanted
nothing to do with it.

388
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,170
Case closed.

389
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,040
Just like the 380,000 cases
of child abuse

390
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,840
Reported in this country
each year.

391
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,440
Less than one percent
gets to trial.

392
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,770
Does that make you
want to even the odds?

393
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:12,400
Every time i listen
to a child

394
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:15,000
Vividly recount
the most horrific

395
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,440
Acts of abuse

396
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,900
Done at the hands
of a father,

397
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,770
An uncle,

398
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,570
Someone they're
supposed to trust...

399
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,300
It's all i can do
not to break down.

400
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:30,240
But that's all
i'm capable of.

401
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,470
After that, like you,

402
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,240
I trust in
the justice system.

403
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,600
[cell phone rings]

404
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:42,170
Rossi.

405
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,870
Midnight. my restaurant.

406
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,370
Most people
never meet bosola.

407
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,640
Those that do
only ever meet him once.

408
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,900
If he smells a fed,
i'm gonna end up
like the duchess.

409
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,800
Now, that would be
a tragedy.

410
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:56,040
[laughs]

411
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,540
All right.

412
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,800
I've never said anything
out of turn, ever, have i?

413
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,440
Go on.

414
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,400
Always you've treated me
like a son.

415
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:17,370
But i'd rather do time
that see you become a rat
and help the feds.

416
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,700
I'm closing the restaurant
tonight.

417
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:23,400
You and the boys
take the night off.

418
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,940
I can't let you do this
alone.

419
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,470
I'm not helping the feds.

420
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,670
I'm helping an old friend.

421
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:37,700
Good night. go on.

422
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:47,100
Rossi: he dims the lights,
we go in.

423
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,870
So, uh, jack's what,
4 today?

424
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,040
Yeah.

425
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,500
And i literally have
no idea where he is.

426
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:55,900
He's safe.

427
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,970
I saw prentiss and morgan
up the block,

428
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,770
But the two agents
in the sedan,

429
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,200
They're not with us.

430
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,840
That the counter surveillance
in case foyet is watching me.

431
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:11,140
For which, apparently,
there's no more money.

432
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,140
Yeah, i heard.

433
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,600
Did somebody call you?

434
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,800
They're concerned.

435
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:21,940
What did you say?
what i'm telling you.

436
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,770
An attack against you
is an attack against all of us.

437
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,040
[cell phone rings]

438
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,500
Why are you calling?
you ok?

439
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,570
I hope you got
some good guys out there.

440
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,770
This man is a mean
son of a bitch.

441
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,070
We're all over.
he's not gonna know
what hit him.

442
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,740
Hey, that kid--

443
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,500
The, uh, smart one--

444
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:42,340
I could use a little help.

445
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,670
Reid?

446
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,740
Reid here.

447
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,000
Crossword question.

448
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,400
10 letters.

449
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,900
Crater creator.

450
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,740
10 letters,

451
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,400
Crater creator.

452
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:56,340
Arctangent.

453
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,200
Did you get that?

454
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:01,470
Damn, she's smart.

455
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,870
Mm-hmm.

456
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,470
Did you see that--

457
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,470
Flash?

458
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,840
I saw that.

459
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,940
He's already in there.

460
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,370
All units, go, go, go!

461
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,380
Morgan's out canvassing
the area.

462
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,780
This whole place
is swarming with cops.

463
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,010
We had the streets,
the building, even
the damn roof covered.

464
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,510
How the hell
did he get through us?

465
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,110
Garcia traced finnegan's
phone calls.

466
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:17,440
He made one at 4:38
to a pre-paid cell,

467
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,940
Another one to you at 11:41.

468
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:22,080
We gave bosola 7 hours
to prepare.

469
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,680
I think he was here
before we arrived.

470
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,480
And he heard ray
call me.

471
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,580
This is all my fault.

472
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,880
Now he knows we're onto him.

473
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,240
He's not the only one.

474
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:33,140
Whoever he works for
does, too.

475
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:35,780
Each mutilation
represents the crimes

476
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,280
The unsubs believe
these 3 individuals committed.

477
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,280
Unsubs?

478
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,010
Unknown subjects. 2.

479
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,440
Both male. unsub "a"
we're calling
the planner.

480
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,740
He works in the criminal
justice system.

481
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:49,580
We're looking at both
defense and prosecution
attorneys,

482
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,140
Judges, and even cops.

483
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:53,140
We believe that the planner
has experienced

484
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:54,840
A devastating personal tragedy
of some sort.

485
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:57,310
And because of
the sophisticated nature
of the scenario,

486
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:00,010
We believe unsub "a"
is in his late 50s or 60s.

487
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,410
The planner likely met
unsub "b", the enforcer,

488
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,480
Within the court system.

489
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,140
He's been hired
to carry out justice.

490
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:08,480
Now, this type of justice
does not come cheap.

491
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:12,640
So the planner has access
to substantial cash.

492
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,610
Absolutely no attempt
was made

493
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,080
To hide the mutilation.

494
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,510
This suggests the planner
either doesn't care
what we find

495
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,340
Or he wants us to find it.

496
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:22,310
Now, the enforcer,
on the other hand,

497
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,540
Has no such intentions.

498
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:25,480
He should be considered armed
and extremely dangerous.

499
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,780
Thank you.

500
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,110
All right. let's go, people.

501
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:39,680
All final payments
have been made.

502
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:43,180
I see no reason
not to complete the tasks

503
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,610
Or to converse further.

504
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,780
Good. one last request--

505
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,610
I would like you
to pay special attention

506
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,080
To mr. patton.

507
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,580
I've concentrated
on the last 3 cases.

508
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,480
They've left
the freshest e-prints.

509
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,480
Great.

and hundreds of people.

Hey, there are 93 mob trials
in the last 10 years.

518
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:35,010
Put aside any trials that
resulted in a conviction.

519
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,110
Weed out mistrials
and arraignments.

520
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,240
Uh, 19.

521
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:41,480
Were any of those on trial

522
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,740
Suspected of being hitmen
or enforcers?

was judged a mistrial,

Cross-match our profile

Wait, wait.

535
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:09,580
Did you say judge schuller?

536
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,940
Yeah, here's a photo.

537
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:14,180
What's wrong?

538
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,680
Prentiss:
do you know him?

539
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,140
No. but i knew his wife.

540
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,840
2 years ago she was
driving home from work

541
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,480
And she was killed
by a drunk driver.

542
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,710
That could be
the tragedy.

543
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,680
She was the love
of his life,
that's for sure.

544
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,010
12 months ago, judge schuller
took a leave of absence

545
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,210
Due to health issues.

546
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,980
He was diagnosed
with terminal cancer.

547
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,080
He has 6 months to live.

548
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,580
And that's when
the killing started.

549
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,680
You don't seriously
think judge--

550
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,840
Judge schuller
is the planner.

551
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:38,780
Fits the profile.
yes, i do.

552
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,680
And tony mecacci
is most likely
bosola the enforcer.

553
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,140
What have you got
on bosola?

554
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:46,210
Uh, he went off the grid
after his last trial.

555
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:49,080
Jj, put out a statewide apb
and release mecacci's photo
to the media.

556
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,210
Judge schuller's
a highly-respected man.

557
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,880
We can't just walk in there
and accuse him
of serial murder.

558
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,340
Then i'll go to
the attorney general

559
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:59,110
And petition the chief justice
if i have to.

560
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,010
And maybe not.

561
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:06,680
I believe
you're looking for me.

562
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,310
You know we have to
advise you of your rights.

563
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:23,980
I waive my constitutional
rights against
self-incrimination.

564
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,910
When you walked in here,

565
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,910
You said, "i believe
you're looking for me."

566
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,310
And i was right.

567
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:33,510
Your timing was impeccable.

568
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,310
But how could you
know that?

569
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:38,280
I knew it wouldn't take
you long to find me.

570
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,440
Not after what
i've left behind.

571
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,580
So you don't deny
any of this?

572
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,480
Why would i?
what you see as a crime,
i see as justice.

573
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,840
Ray finnegan
was a friend of mine.

574
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:51,780
Ray finnegan was a criminal.

575
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,180
You should choose your friends
more wisely.

576
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,510
It must have really
thrown you

577
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,540
When ray showed up
at emma's funeral.

578
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:02,680
How do you know
about my wife?

579
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:06,640
You have absolutely no idea
who i am, do you?

580
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:12,340
Ray told rossi
you only meet bosola once.

581
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:14,840
So judge schuller
had to have given him
a list of names.

582
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:16,510
He never needs
to see him again,

583
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,440
Just make final payment
on proof of death.

584
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:20,280
Have garcia hack into
schuller's files

585
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,610
And track his financial records

586
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,140
Before everything
gets shut down.

587
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:24,940
And find out if his office
made any calls.

588
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:27,140
They did. i spoke to them
a few hours ago.

589
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:28,910
I told them we had
two suspects.

590
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,310
So he knows we're onto him.

591
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,310
He came here to stall.

592
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:36,210
He does have a list.
there's more to come.

593
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,740
Could we just get on
with what i came here for?

594
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:43,780
Why? so bosola can go on
and carry on

595
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,740
Whatever it is
you asked of him to do? no.

596
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:48,080
You call him
and you end this.

597
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:51,480
Even if i could,
i wouldn't.

598
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:54,210
She was born
emma louise taylor,

599
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,780
4th of july 1958.

600
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,610
You could get that
from anywhere.

601
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,180
When she was 6,
her dad john

602
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,240
Brought him a black
and white homeless kitten.

603
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:09,410
If she knew you...

604
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,080
Emma would have told me.

605
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,680
She named it oscar,

606
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,510
After oscar wilde.

607
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:17,840
And of all oscar wilde's
work, she loved

608
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:21,410
<i>an ideal husband the most.</i>

609
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:27,410
I don't know how you know
all of this about emma

610
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,910
Or what you hope to achieve,

611
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,310
But we're done.

612
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,810
You know the charges.
charge me.

613
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:37,240
Is that what started
all this insanity--

614
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,640
Emma's death?

615
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:42,680
What started all of this
was the 35 years

616
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,310
I had to sit and watch

617
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:47,180
As the system
i swore an oath to protect

618
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,610
Failed the very people
our justice system
was meant to protect.

619
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,280
I wonder what emma
would make of all this.

620
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:57,040
Every single person
on that list deserves justice,

621
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:59,840
And it's justice
they managed to evade.

622
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:02,410
Morgan: so...

623
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,810
You do have a list.

624
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,410
I'm finished talking.

625
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,840
Oh-oh, we've got gobs
of two-way traffic going on,

626
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,540
Which means someone
is trying to bounce us out.

627
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:19,510
Ok, bosola
didn't come cheap,

628
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,180
So judge schuller
had to have made

629
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,680
Some pretty substantial
transactions.

630
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,240
Got wire transfers
to a cayman island bank

631
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,810
And that's where
the trace ends.

632
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,510
How many, how much?

633
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:30,580
June, he debits numerations
of $9,999

634
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,010
Every few days, total of 4,
he takes a break for a few weeks

635
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,710
Until he makes
his final transaction
for the same magic number.

636
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:38,580
Anything less than
$10,000 keeps the irs
off your trail.

637
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,080
I know that, too.

638
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:43,210
So, the final payment
must be for proof of death.

639
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,780
That makes $50,000
the price of a kill.

640
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,510
He did that 3 times
over a period of 12 months,

641
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,840
But 2 days ago,

642
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:52,310
He raided his account
for $100,000 all in one hit.

643
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,480
He also closed
all his accounts

644
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,810
And handed
his entire estate over

645
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,280
To a victims support group.

646
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,310
Someone who isn't suffering
from too many brainiacs

647
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,810
In the high-tech kitchen
just bounced us out.

648
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,780
Good job.

649
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:05,040
If our calculations
are correct,

650
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,880
There are 2 more names
on that list.

651
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,910
There are.

652
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,610
Every single person
on that list deserves
justice.

653
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,840
He said deserves,
not deserved.

654
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,110
Now look.

655
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:16,040
Right there. he looked at
his watch for the second time.

656
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:19,640
Whatever he's waiting for
is about to happen.

657
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,250
I don't think
you knew emma at all.

658
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,790
At least not the one
i knew.

659
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:33,420
I made an excuse
for myself

660
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:35,650
That i wouldn't be
welcome at her funeral.

661
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:39,350
But the truth is,
i couldn't face it.

662
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:42,650
You knowing emma
changes nothing.

663
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,020
Oh, but it does.

664
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:47,190
Emma changed the lives
of everyone she knew.

665
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:50,020
But at least ray and i
saw her death

666
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:51,850
For what it truly was--

667
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,190
A tragic accident.

668
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,520
Dan patton was drunk.

669
00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:00,320
He murdered emma, as surely
as if he put a gun to her head.

670
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:02,950
Is that why
his photo's not here?

671
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,690
You're saving the best
for last?

672
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,450
We need to locate
dan patton now.

673
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,420
The 100,000 must be
for some serious extras.

674
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:30,020
How many other people
have you targeted?

675
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:32,720
I want the truth.

676
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:34,390
I have nothing more to say.

677
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:36,720
Oh, but i do.

678
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:38,290
I ran into emma,
by chance,

679
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,720
A few years ago,

680
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,290
At a hotel
in manhattan.

681
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:44,320
I was working
on a case, so was she.

682
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:47,050
I knew she was married.

683
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,520
But i didn't care.

684
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:54,250
She...

685
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,990
She wouldn't.

686
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:58,090
No.

687
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:01,690
Emma would not do that
to me.

688
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,350
You're lying.

689
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,790
Emma...

690
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,890
I want the truth.

691
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,650
You first.

692
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:15,720
Dan patton is the last one.

693
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:18,190
There are no more.

694
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,620
Now, tell me the truth.

695
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:24,290
That night in manhattan,

696
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:28,420
She told me our connection
was so strong,

697
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:32,520
It could never happen
only once.

698
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:37,890
And i was fine with that.

699
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:51,520

00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,650
Please,
please don't kill me.

706

This isn't about money.

707
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:23,990
This is about the murder
of emma schuller.

708
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:26,120
Emma? oh, god.

709
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,420
Emma--that was--
that was an accident.

710
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:28,790
Please. no, that
was an accident.

711
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:30,990
Please--please don't--

712
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:36,590
At least...

713
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:41,290
You now know what kind of man
you're working with.

714
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:42,650
What kind of man
are you, judge?

715
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,320
I've had enough
of seeing the guilty

716
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:47,490
Walk free of their sins.

717
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:52,020
But what about your sins?

718
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:58,050
I got cancer for mine.

719
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,390
Maybe he's still at work.

720
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:03,220
Workplace said he left
for the day.

721
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:14,220
[knocks] dan patton,
this is the fbi.

722
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:25,190
Prentiss: clear!

723
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:32,450
One to the heart,
one to the head.

724
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,520
We know who did it.

725
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:37,790
Bosola has no way
of getting off long island.

726
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:38,950
They're moving judge schuller.

727
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:39,850
What?

728
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,950
He's a high court judge.

729
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,190
It makes it a federal case now.

730
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,590
What if bosola
has no intention

731
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:44,920
Of leaving the island?

732
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:48,090
Garcia said the judge
was giving his whole
estate away?

733
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,490
His property, his money.

734
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:51,250
He closed out his accounts
and paid off his utility bills.

735
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,750
He has cancer, but he still
has 6 months to live.

736
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:56,250
Is there a reason
he's paying off
all his bills now?

737
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,920
Not to mention
the 100,000 he made

738
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:03,390
As a last and final payment
for not one, but 2 kills.

739
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:05,090
Usually the judge waits
for confirmation of death

740
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,750
Before making final payment.

741
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:10,090
Only this time he knew
he wouldn't be around
to see it.

742
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,920
Here he comes!

743
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:13,050
Oh, there he is.

744
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,050
Judge schuller!

745
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,320
Judge schuller is helping us

746
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,790
With a federal
investigation.

747
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:18,390
Wait a minute. what?
i can't hear you. speak up.

748
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:19,850
Judge schuller, does this
have anything to do with

749
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,290
The recent
rash of murders?

750
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:23,220
I am of the belief
that justice has been served.

751
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:24,920
Morgan: hotch,
wait a minute. what?

752
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:26,050
[reporters
all talking at once]

753
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,090
No comment.

754
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,120
Judge schuller,
can you confirm reports...

755
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,950
I lied.

756
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:30,950
What?

757
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,450
...your status
in this case?

758
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:38,250
[gunshot, screaming]

759
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,090
Everybody down!
get on the ground!

760
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:42,250
Down on the ground!
stay down!

761
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,490
[screaming and shouting]
get down!

762
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:11,190
She was special to you.

763
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:16,520
I was just thinking...

764
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:18,020
When i first met emma,

765
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:21,490
I knew i would love her
for the rest of my life.

766
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:24,120
We were 12 years old.

767
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:26,820
She always said
we were doomed

768
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:29,690
To be star-crossed lovers,

769
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,850
Destined to wonder

770
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,450
What might have been.

771
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:40,620
I never slept with her,
you know.

772
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:42,590
That wasn't true

773
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:44,520
What i said to schuller.

774
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:46,950
That was just to
get under his skin,

775
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,920
Knock him off his game.

776
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:51,790
I understand.

777
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:55,820
I should have
married her, though.

778
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:01,290
When i left the marines,

779
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:03,820
I was recruited
by the bureau,

780
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:05,590
Spent a few years
on the streets,

781
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:08,650
Got involved with
starting the bau.

782
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,850
And before i knew it,

783
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,790
A lifetime had gone by.

784
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:16,620
I hear you.

785
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:20,150
I missed a life with emma

786
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:25,650
Because i became obsessed
with the chase.

787
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,390
With the hunt.

788
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:29,820
Dave, he's threatening
my family.

789
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:32,850
And we'll get foyet, aaron.

790
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,250
Then what's your point?

791
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:41,620
You have a family.

792
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:45,050
When all this is over,

793
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,790
What are you gonna do...

794
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:50,850
To make sure
you're not a lonely guy

795
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:57,250
Wondering why you let
the purest thing
in your life...

796
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,050
Get away?

797
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:10,090
[car alarm chirps]

798
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:18,850
Going somewhere?

799
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,920
Hear the joke
about the two irishmen--

800
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:29,050
[groaning]

801
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:32,620
Yeah, i heard it.

802
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:34,890
Didn't find it funny
the first time.

803
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:36,620
Rossi: "i have always found

804
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:40,590
That mercy bears richer fruit
than strict justice."

805
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:42,450
Abraham lincoln.
