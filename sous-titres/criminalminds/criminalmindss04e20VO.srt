1
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,890
How are you feeling today?

2
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,660
You let me smoke.

3
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,170
What more can I ask for?

4
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,050
Most patients have a hard time
coping with new surroundings.

5
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,360
They probably believe
they'll be released.

6
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,800
I'm not so naive.

7
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,020
You don't believe you'll be getting out?

8
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,210
Would you let me out?

9
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,110
I'd like to talk about adam.

10
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,890
He's still missing.

11
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,420
So I've heard.

12
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,130
- Will you help us find him?
- No.

13
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,250
Why not? What more do you need to hide?

14
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,260
I'm not hiding anything.

15
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:07,210
And I think the better question would
be,what are you looking for... Dr. Reid?

16
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:13,760
I think you know what I'm looking for.

17
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,370
I want to hear you say it.

18
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,930
I am looking for adam.

19
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:25,970
Just because you caught me
doesn't mean you'll find him.

20
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,940
You're not that smart.

21
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,330
This isn't about being smart.

22
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,190
This is out doing the right thing.

23
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:41,200
I did the right thing.

24
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,380
*******

25
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:29,360
***********

26
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,600
Chandler,looks like I got
the night off after all.

27
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,080
Yeah,what she don't know only
makes it that much better.

28
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,240
Yeah,sounds like a plan.

29
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:50,150
Right. I'm gonna change and
i'll,uh... I'll hit you back.

30
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,140
Hey,i saw you earlier,didn't i?

31
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,340
My name's dan.

32
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,810
Adam.

33
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,300
Adam!

34
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,190
Where's madison? I thought you were off.

35
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,070
Oh,she wasn't feeling
well,so I sent her home.

36
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:15,050
Listen,we had another early checkout,so
could you turn it over before you clock out?

37
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:16,890
What,I'm a cleaning lady now?

38
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,440
I'm your boss,and you'll be
whatever I want you to be.

39
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,020
Ok. What room?

40
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,890
319.

41
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,150
daniel keller,21,a junior at
benjamin franklin university.

42
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:05,030
He was killed last night while
spring breaking in south padre island.

43
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,850
c.o.d.asphyxiation.

44
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,500
He was the second victim to be
murdered there in the past 3 nights.

45
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:15,080
The first was william browder,also
on spring break,c.o.d.asphyxiation.

46
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,600
They were both sexually
assaulted prior to death.

47
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,410
Men being raped and murdered on
spring break? Well,that's a twist.

48
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,610
So far the deaths have
been localized to one hotel.

49
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,080
The hudson street hotel.

50
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:29,920
Initially,the hotel was filled to
capacity but lost 20% occupancy overnight.

51
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,640
We should get a list of
everyone who works there.

52
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,670
There's a good chance one of them is the
unsub,at the very least has interacted with him.

53
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,110
Yeah,gaia's already on that.

54
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,920
Both victims were
discovered by hotel staff,

55
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:42,610
the last after online checkout
indicated the room had been vacated.

56
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:45,800
So he wanted the bodies discovered,and
sooner rather than later.

57
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,100
Look at the way they're posed--
naked,cowering in the fetal position.

58
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,420
He's sending a message.

59
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,190
Something about this
is important to him.

60
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,410
We just need to figure out what.

61
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:56,730
And we need to do it soon.

62
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:59,270
The police suspect the unsub could
be another vacationing student,

63
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,180
Though I'm not willing to
rule out local involvement.

64
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:02,030
Makes sense.

65
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:06,130
If the killer is a student,they could be halfway
across the country by the time we're onto them.

66
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,080
If he's a local,we could lose him
as soon as his victim pool dries up.

67
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,640
Either way,we're almost out of time.

68
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,690
South padre spring break
season ends this weekend.

faster than anything.

73
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:57,740
"but it is wrong. No matter
how fast light travels,"

74
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:03,400
"it finds the darkness has always gotten
there first and is waiting for it."

75
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,790
Terry pratchett.

76
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,670
National media has
picked up on the story.

77
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,390
We're gonna have to make
a statement when we land.

78
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,070
We want to make people aware
without obviously causing panic.

79
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,810
Stress hypervigilance,the whole
buddy system,yeah,I'm all over it.

80
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,160
I just don't think
anyone's gonna listen.

81
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,380
What do you mean?

82
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:21,230
Come on. Drunk college students don't exactly
want to hear they shouldn't talk to strangers.

83
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:21,990
Right.

84
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,870
Was there any dna left on the scene?

85
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,190
Uh,yeah. Too much dna.

86
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,890
This portion of the garcia show will be
brought to you by the letter "i" for icky.

87
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:34,410
The lab has recovered over
100 different trace samples,

88
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,580
as multiple guests
create a cesspool of dna.

89
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:42,640
Also,there is no way to determine
the exact time of "secretion"

90
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,930
or to eliminate anyone
actually working at the hotel.

91
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,240
Were you able to find any connection
between the first two victims?

92
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,050
No. They grew up in different states,

93
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,020
The went to colleges on opposite coasts I did
the whole cross-reference credit card thing,

94
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:52,880
couldn't make it connect.

95
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,400
- So the hotel's the only common denominator.
- Yeah.

96
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,680
And it should be noted that the
first victim,william browder,

97
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,120
wasn't exactly a registered guest.

98
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,870
Well,that's a popular thing to do.
I mean,youngsters do it all the time.

99
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,920
They rent a room,they pack in as
many kids as possible to save costs.

100
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,600
We could be dealing with
hundreds of unregistered guests.

101
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,890
We need to check every guest,whether
they were on the books or not.

102
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,170
Male raping male.

103
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,680
So are we presing our unsub
or victims could be gay?

104
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,320
That's not necessarily true.

105
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,410
In male rape,sexual preference
typically has less to do with the crime

106
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:22,310
than the power And dominance the
attacker feels from the act itself.

107
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:26,030
Still,it's a question we should ask
the families when we interview them.

108
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,200
It could help us determine
how the unsub met the victims.

109
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,600
We got a lot of work to do.

110
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,630
Emily,jj,and I will go to the
local p.d.and start victimology.

111
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,380
The rest of you,there's your new home.

112
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:44,830
You must be the fbi.

113
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,940
David rossi. These are
agents morgan and reid.

114
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,730
Julie riley. I'm the manager.

115
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,580
You were on duty when the
latest body was discovered?

116
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,730
That's right.

117
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,070
Did you happen to notice
anyone out of the ordinary?

118
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:55,890
I'm afraid not.

119
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,800
You see so many faces during the spring
break,pretty soon they all start to blur.

120
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,000
We need to set up interviews with the
rest of your staff as soon as possible,

121
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,840
also talk to the hotel guests.

122
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,620
Of course.

123
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,210
How many cameras do you
have on the property?

124
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,290
Not enough.

125
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:14,900
We have all the main entrances
and the garage covered.

126
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,290
But the hallways and the
service tunnels aren't equipped.

127
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:20,060
Can you show us the room
where the last body was found?

128
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,940
Um,i'll start rounding up the rest
of the staff for you to talk to.

129
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,120
Thanks.

130
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,390
No signs of struggle reported.

131
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:37,450
Everything seemed normal
when housekeeping arrived.

132
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,850
Look at this.

133
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,110
Scratch marks on the footboard.

134
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,940
The victims were bound
before the struggle gan.

135
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,630
Well,that would make sense. Both
victims were in pretty good shape.

136
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,570
Probly needed them tied up
in order to control them.

137
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:54,250
The question is,was it
consensual or was it coerced?

138
00:09:59,100 --> 00:09:59,920
Reese evans.

139
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,250
Agent hotchner. These are
agents prentiss and jareau.

140
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,120
Hello.

141
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,480
Well,thanks for being here.

142
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:07,730
If it's all right with you,we'd like to talk to
the victim's friends and family as soon as possible.

143
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,540
Of course.Michael browder,the
father of the first victim

144
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,590
has just arrived to
claim his son's body.

145
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,160
And the second victim's girlfriend
should be here within the hour.

146
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:18,110
Does,uh,mr. Browder know the
details of his son's murder.

147
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:19,590
Not everything.

148
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,810
I mean,there were certain matters I
didn't want to bring up on the phone.

149
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,950
If you don't mind,we'd like
to handle that ourselves.

150
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:27,380
We're gonna have to ask him a few
difficult questions about his son.

151
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:29,660
Honestly,i have been
dreading it all day.

152
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,850
- I'll talk to the girlfriend.
- Right this way.

153
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,430
So if I'm the unsub and it wasn't
consensual,how does this work?

154
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,360
You'd have to have a weapon.

155
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:45,450
A gun to the face means
he doesn't scream out.

156
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,910
Look at the distance between
where each of the arms were tied.

157
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,690
There's no way he could have
tied that second hand himself.

158
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,180
Which means the unsub did it for him.

159
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:58,400
Which would be risky,because if he knew he was in
danger and he saw the opportunity,he would take it.

160
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,560
Then why not drug him and then
tie him up? Eliminate the risk.

161
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,410
The tox screen came back negative.

162
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,200
So it's either consensual
or he has a partner.

163
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,680
- He's also learning fast.
- What do you mean?

164
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:21,200
He hides the body in the closet and then
indicates that the guest has checked out.

165
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:24,390
Which means when the
housekeeper gets here...

166
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:29,700
everything looks normal And she
starts cleaning,wiping everything down.

167
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,890
Erasing any fingerprints or dna which
could have been left on the scene.

168
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:35,430
We need to talk to
whoever cleaned this room.

169
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:39,590
Maybe they saw something that can tell
us who was in here with dan keller.

170
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:50,890
Mr. Browder,did your son have
any history of drug abuse?

171
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,380
Marijuana,methamphetamine,anything?

172
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:59,030
None. He w an athlete in high
school and college. Tested regularly.

173
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:03,920
Did he mention anything about meeting someone
here in south padre? Old acquaintances?

174
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:07,340
He came down with some
friends from his school.

175
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:10,220
They wanted to blow
off steam before finals.

176
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,830
Mr. Browder,was your son gay?

177
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,100
He had had sex with
a man before he died.

178
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:19,830
Knowing whether or not it was consensual
will help us determine how he was targeted.

179
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,540
Adam jackson? Your manager
said we could find you up here.

180
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,390
Uh--i--i get
migraines.

181
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,540
- You discovered the body last night?
- Yeah.

182
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,100
Had you ever seen him before?

183
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,850
Or noticed anyone he may have been with?

184
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,890
I've never seen him before in my life.

185
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,690
Since I opened the closet,i
can't get him out of my head.

186
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:46,260
Adam,what about the first
victim,william browder?

187
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:48,740
Have you ever seen him before?

188
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,000
Never seen either of them.

189
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:55,920
Let me ask you this-- is there anything you remember
about the room before you discovered the body?

190
00:12:55,930 --> 00:13:00,160
It might not seem like much,but the
smallest detail could really help us a lot.

191
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,060
It looked pretty normal.

192
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:06,380
I mean,until I opened the closet door.

193
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,510
Did anything stand out about the body?

194
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:12,320
Or,uh,for that matter,anyone
at the hotel last night?

195
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,170
No,man. You seen one drunk
frat guy,you seen 'em all.

196
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,420
Adam,i thought you said
you didn't recognize him.

197
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:23,010
I didn't. I just--that girl from
corpus christi across the******

198
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,940
They walk around like they
own the place,you know?

199
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,470
They think they can
do whatever they want.

200
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,920
How long have you worked here?

201
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:31,420
6 months,i guess.

202
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,490
- Appreciate your time.
- Thank you.

203
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,030
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

204
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,150
You've seen bad stuff,right?

205
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,080
I have,yeah.

206
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:50,530
How long before you can close
your eyes without it being there?

207
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,110
I'm afraid I still don't know.

208
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,900
Morgan and reid are
finishing the interview.

209
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:03,740
What did you learn?

210
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:05,950
It doesn't look like either
of our victims was gay.

211
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:10,940
Dan keller's girlfriend describes him as
overtly sexual and aggressive towards women.

212
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:13,460
It caused quite a few
problems in their relationship.

213
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,900
And his friends said they were
out partying prior to his death,

214
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:19,050
And he was definitely willing to overlook
the fact that he had a girlfriend.

215
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,690
Does that match with what
you found at the scene?

216
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,210
Yes and no.

217
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,070
What do you mean?

218
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:26,250
The victims were both big guys,yet
there were no signs of a struggle.

219
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:30,180
We profile it as either
being consensual or...

220
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:31,730
The unsub had a partner.

221
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,160
Sounds right. What's your hesitation?

222
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,600
- What if it was both?
- How so?

223
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:42,840
Well,even if he was confronted by two men,the
first reaction of an alpha male would be to fight.

224
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,930
- But not if it were a woman.
- It's spring break.

225
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:50,560
She lures the victim to her hotel
room,ties him up,then once he's subdued...

226
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:51,940
Her partner arrives.

227
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,650
That could explain the
posing and the rape.

228
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:58,690
The victims are alpha males with
aggressive sexual tendencies.

229
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:03,060
The unsub treats his victims
the way they treat women.

230
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,670
So we have a team.

231
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,460
A woman who lures them back to
their hotel room and ties them up...

232
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,220
And a man who rapes and murders them.

233
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,270
********

234
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,260
Thanks,man.

235
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,070
Oh,look at that.

236
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,980
Whoa ho,where are you going?

237
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,500
Don't worry about it.

238
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,810
Your unsubs have changed hotels.

239
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,850
What can you tell us?

240
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:28,570
The vic's name is carl
cade,another spring breaker.

241
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,280
Any witnesses?

242
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:33,280
His friends saw him last night leave a
party with a brunette in a green dress.

243
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:35,100
Both had been drinking
for most of the day,

244
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,940
And he only caught a glimpse of
the girl before they left the party.

245
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:41,420
And he found the body
posed just like the others.

246
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,750
It sounds like our theory
about the partners was right.

247
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:53,420
Woman lures the victim back,she offers
up a little kink,then ties him up.

248
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:56,210
Only this time the unsubs ventured
outside of their comfort zone.

249
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,500
They changed hotels.

250
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:00,300
Ok,so what's he doing,getting
bolder or smarter?

251
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,570
Well,the local police are
on alert,the fbi is here.

252
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:05,770
They probably changed pattern
to avoid getting caught.

253
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,950
Or because they saw
us at the other hotel.

254
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,230
We need to go back to hudson street.

255
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,940
We believe at least one of our unsubs

256
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,470
Is either a guest at the hudson street
hotel or possible an employee there.

257
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,730
We have agents in uniforms
recanvassing the entire property.

258
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,660
But we all know kids on spring break.

259
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,300
They migrate from place to place.

260
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,990
We can't be sure that the
killer's still on site.

261
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,330
Which is why we need you
to circulate this profile.

262
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,910
We believe we're looking for
a dominant/submissive team,

263
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,160
a man and a woman probably in their 20s.

264
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:39,810
We are looking for a heterosexual male who
most likely is submissive in his everyday life,

265
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,050
With everyone except his partner.

266
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,060
To her he becomes dominant.

267
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:46,900
His submissive female partner
will be socially awkward,

268
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:50,320
of average intelligence,and
emotionally unstable.

269
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,950
Look for women who are reclusive,have
a problem with authority,

270
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,650
and can't interact with
dominant personalities.

271
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:59,120
This form of male rape is
about power and dominance.

272
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:03,180
It is not about sexual
orientation. So victimology is key.

273
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:09,140
This team targets alpha personality males
who think that women are their right.

274
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:13,420
Add drugs or alcohol to the equation
and now we're dealing with eager victims.

275
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:17,990
Even with the mention of rape,an alpha
personality fueled by intoxication believes

276
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,180
That he can control the situation
and eventually gain the upper hand.

277
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:25,500
We'll need to blanket the beach with
fliers,talk to other hotels and bartenders.

278
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:30,180
We have got 2 days until the spring
break season ends,so let's get to work.

279
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:32,050
Hey,hotch,i think we got something.

280
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,660
Check this-- no report male
rape anywhere in the area.

281
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:37,810
It's not surprising since it's like one
of the least reported crimes on the books.

282
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:41,250
I also looked at video surveillance
for the hudson street hotel

283
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,590
on the days of both murders,and zip.

284
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,860
Tell me there is a "but" coming.

285
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:48,940
But,i also looked at the days
leading up to both murders,

286
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:52,480
And,wouldn't you know
it,jackpot of jackpots,

287
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:56,150
that would be william
browder,aka victim number one.

288
00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:00,480
I would like to call him jerkface,seemingly
making advances at damsel in distress,

289
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:03,850
aka hotel employee madison cooke.

290
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:06,420
See jerkface grab damsel,

291
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,960
see adam jackson-- Let's call
him white knight--intervene.

292
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:13,000
See jerkface knock white knight down.

293
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:15,810
See white knight pause.

294
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,140
See whe knight go postal.

295
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,840
- Didn't the maintenance man find the second victim?
- Yeah.

296
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:23,800
And he told reid and morgan that he'd
never met either of the first two victims.

297
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:24,730
So why lie?

298
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:28,040
Garcia,i need everything
you can find on adam jackson.

299
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:30,480
- I'm already on that.
- Dave,are you still at the scene?

300
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,860
Good,we've got a possible.

301
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,040
Where's adam jackson?

302
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,280
I don't know. What's going on?

303
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:44,300
The day before the first murder,u
had an altercation with the victim.

304
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,610
It's spring break. It
comes with the territory.

305
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,270
- Adam stepped in?
- Yeah.

306
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,700
He doesn't strike me as the
type to stand up to a bully.

307
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:53,030
The guy was being a jerk.
Adam happened to be there.

308
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:57,230
And you didn't think it was weird that
the same kid ended up dead the next night?

309
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,660
It wasn't adam.

310
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:03,700
Then why hide the fact that he got
into a fight with one of the victims?

311
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,320
Julie told us not to.

312
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:07,460
She was just trying to protect us both.

313
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:10,450
- Where's adam?
- I don't know. Honestly.

314
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:13,820
He's supposed to be on duty,but
he disappears sometimes.

315
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:16,120
He might be on the roof.

316
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,660
Morgan,check the roof.

317
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,650
Adam jackson's life reads like
a "how to make an unsub" manual.

318
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:31,060
Born in corpus christi,biological
mother rosemary jackson.

319
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:35,490
In and out of hospitals--
broken arm,broken rib,exhaustion.

320
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,690
The polite way of saying spousal abuse.

321
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,510
Exactly. And then she died
suddenly when adam was 5.

322
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,710
Father unknown.

323
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:46,910
Adam was left in the custody
of his stepfather,mark harrison.

324
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,630
Then it became adam who was in
and out of the emergency room.

325
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:54,620
He was eventually foster-homed in dallas until
he was granted emancipation at the age of 16.

326
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,390
I would bet you if we could
see mike harrison back then,

327
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:00,510
He would bear a striking
resemblance to our unsubs' victims.

328
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,880
Good work,garcia. Keep digging.

329
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,890
Adam!

330
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,570
Come here. Come here.

331
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,010
What's happening?

332
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,850
- You're coming with us. - I--i
don't understand. What's going on?

333
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,330
Let's go.

334
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:21,110
He doesn't really look like the
dominant partner type,does he?

335
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,970
No.

336
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:28,020
- He's our guy.
- What makes you so sure?

337
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,590
It's a classic profile.

338
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:32,540
He grows up with an abusive
stepfather,somehow manages to escape.

339
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:35,790
Suddenly he finds himself back in the
exact same area where his abuser lives.

340
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,370
He's surrounded by nothing but a bunch of
alpha males that mirror that type of behavior.

341
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:40,690
He snaps.

342
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:44,430
Did he have a problem with you as an
authority figure when you interviewed him?

343
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,220
He backed away as if he
was a little skittish.

344
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,140
And reid?

345
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:50,230
Reid was a little less imposing
and he opened up about his life.

346
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,330
Where's julie?

347
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,410
We're trying to find her.

348
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,890
She's gonna go ballistic.

349
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,370
You're in a lot of trouble,adam.

350
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:05,080
But I think you know that,right?

351
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:11,460
The only thing that I did wrong was
leave work without telling my boss.

352
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:18,500
I--i need to
talk to julie.

353
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:26,870
Adam...

354
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,070
Why don't you tell me about the
fight you had with the first victim?

355
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,210
I don't remember.

356
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:43,280
You don't remember?

357
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:51,310
No.

358
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:58,330
Adam,i really want to help you out,but you'
gonna have to do a lot better than that.

359
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:04,650
Please...

360
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:07,870
I just need to talk to julie!

361
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:13,050
Hotch.

362
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,160
I just got off with garcia.

363
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:18,760
So,adam jackson doesn't
just work at the hotel.

364
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,360
- He lives there,too.
- What have we got?

365
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:24,290
When adam was kicked out of school for
bad grades,drug possession,And petty theft,

366
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,220
he started staying at the hotel.

367
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,920
Julie riley pays his bills.

368
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,140
- The manager?
- Yeah.

369
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:31,560
She's bailed him out of jail
twice in the past 4 years.

370
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:36,100
She's also the one that told madison to cover up
the fact that adam had a fight with the first victim.

371
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:37,920
What's the connection
between julie and adam?

372
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:43,520
Uh,it turns out when julie was in college
she volunteered at the foster care facility

373
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:46,530
adam used to reside in between homes.

374
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:50,610
She befriended him and became the
surrogate for the absent mother.

375
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,940
And now she's his boss.
He owes her everything.

376
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:55,630
Adam's not the minant,julie is.

377
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:58,690
- Garcia.
- Yes,sir.

378
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:01,240
I need you to track any
movement on julie riley.

379
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:03,570
Cell phone,credit card,atm withdrawal.

380
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,270
I need a last known location.

381
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,250
Julie riley used her
credit card 15 minutes ago.

382
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:12,060
I'm tying the address
to your gps... Now.

383
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,900
Let's go.

384
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:08,100
Believe me,kid,this is your lucky night.

385
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,370
***********

386
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:23,150

392
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,670
*********

393
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:54,660
Adam,let's talk about the fight you had
with the first victim,william browder.

394
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,490
There's nothing to tell.

395
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:59,350
He grabbed madison,i tried to stop him.

396
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,530
That guy was pretty big.

397
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,640
So?

398
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:08,310
Adam,guys like you and I aren't,uh,we
aren't exactly the fighting type.

399
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:11,440
Well,madisos a good person. She
didn't deserve to be treated that way.

400
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:18,100
You see,now I'm really confused,because you
just told me that you don't remember the fight.

401
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:22,600
I don't. I mean,i--i
don't,but i--i do.

402
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:28,550
You don't,but you do. Can--can
you explain to me how that works?

403
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:33,050
I remember he grabbed at
madison,i tried to stop him,

404
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:36,760
the next thing I knew,julie
was pulling me out of the pool.

405
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:44,750
Why did you tell your
employees to lie to my agents?

406
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:48,720
Adam has a record.

407
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,540
He found one of the bodies.

408
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:53,090
I didn't want you to take the easy
way out and pin the murders on him.

409
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,370
Why do you look out for him?

410
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:57,750
Why did you bail him out of jail,pay
his rent and all of his bills?

411
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:00,450
He's had a rough life.

412
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:02,260
And do you take advantage of that?

413
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,590
No.

414
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,340
Safe to say he'd kill for you?

415
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:08,050
- No!
- Then ela it to me.

416
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:12,500
What exactly is the relationship?

417
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:19,040
We've been friends
since I was just a kid.

418
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:20,930
Are you lovers?

419
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,840
No.

420
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,790
Well,then why does she pay
for everything you have?

421
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:28,130
It's not like it's a handout. I mean...

422
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,730
I'm working at the hotel
so I can pay her back.

423
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,420
Does she pay for the drugs also?

424
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,530
I--i told you,i
get migraines.

425
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:41,160
So,ke a prescription.

426
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,120
I thought you were different.

427
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:51,170
What does that mean?

428
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:56,590
Do you see something in adam's
past that reminds you of yourself?

429
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,020
I don't know what you mean.

430
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:02,570
In 2003,you reported a sexual assault.

431
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:10,600
And from the look of the file,the police
didn't do a very thorough job looking into it.

432
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,020
I don't want to talk about that.

433
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,210
I'm gonna ask you one more
time,would adam kill for you?

434
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,110
No.

435
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,320
Then prove it.

436
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,580
You know a polygraph is not admissible.

437
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:32,610
If we catch them in a lie,it
could help us get a confession.

438
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,460
And we change interrogators so they can't
get into a rhythm with their answers.

439
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:41,070
State your name.

440
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:43,020
Julie riley.

441
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,130
Adam jackson.

442
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:45,900
What color are your eyes?

443
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:47,640
Blue.

444
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,260
Where were you the night
carl cade was killed?

445
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:52,030
- At work.
- At home.

446
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,620
Who is the current president
of the united states?

447
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:56,100
Barack obama.

448
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,750
Did you murder dan keller?

449
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:59,610
Did you murder william browder?

450
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,770
- No.
- No.

451
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,190
What is 32 minus 19?

452
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,770
Would you kill for julie?

453
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:08,380
You lied about the altercation
with william browder.

454
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,110
Is there anything
else you've lied about?

455
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,860
- No.
- No.

456
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:12,970
Did you murder dan keller?

457
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:15,730
What time did you leave work the
night william browder was killed?

458
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:16,580
I--i don't
remember.

459
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:19,140
Have you ever had a sexual
relationship with julie riley?

460
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:20,910
- Have you lied about anything else?
- No.

461
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,080
- Did you murder carl cade?
- He's just a friend.

462
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:26,480
Using the formula y equals mx
plus b,what does b represent?

463
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:28,000
- Would adam kill for you?
- No.

464
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:29,760
- Did you murder carl cade?
- No.

465
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:31,360
- No.
- Did you murder william browder?

466
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:32,470
- No.
- Absolutely not.

467
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,810
- Would you kill for julie?
- No.

468
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:36,650
- No.
- No.

469
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:43,510
What are you looking at?

470
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,980
I'm not sure.

471
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:47,250
- Well,they both passed.
- How is that possible?

472
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:49,860
Not only that,they
passed with flying colors.

473
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:54,410
The only spike I got on adam was a control
question regarding geometric equations,but...

474
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,840
Honestly,i think I just flustered him.

475
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:59,920
Either way,we got nothing.

476
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,510
Well,i think my couch is calling.

477
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,430
Sweet dreams.

478
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,910
What about you?

479
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:39,470
Clean the pool,change the a/c filter,fix
the heat lamps by tonight. I got it.

480
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,940
Yeah,thanks.

481
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,440
So... Where are we?

482
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:56,180
Honestly? Nowhere.

483
00:30:56,430 --> 00:31:00,330
We just watched our two most
viable suspects walk out the door.

484
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:04,350
If adam isn't our unsub,he has all
the makings to become one someday.

485
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,460
Reid?

486
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:09,620
Tell me the question that he
spiked under in the polygraph.

487
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,720
It was a control question
to set the baseline.

488
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,610
It was a geometric equation?

489
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,950
Reid,i really think he
was just intimidated.

490
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:19,720
He tried,he got it wrong,but he wasn't
supposed to know the answer anyway.

491
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,150
What if he lied?

492
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:25,660
What if--what if he knew the answer to the
question but intentionally got it wrong?

493
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:27,250
I--i
don't know.

494
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,910
Why would he do that?

495
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:32,050
Because he realized that he
wouldn't know that answer.

496
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,530
You're losing me,kid.

497
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,910
Adam,are you in here?

498
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,680
Adam said he wasn't getting any rest.

499
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:38,800
He takes midday naps because
he's always exhausted.

500
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,850
He has a history of
blackouts,reclusive behavior,

501
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:43,980
Prolonged repeated abuse suffered
at the hands of a dominant male

502
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:47,840
Who transferred abuse from his female
spouse to his prepubescent child.

503
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,480
Where are you going with this?

504
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:53,130
What if our unsub couple
isn't a couple at all?

505
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:54,940
Dissociative identity disorder.

506
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:57,480
You think adam's a multiple personality?

507
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,940
Well,it fits.

508
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:03,420
Recurrent physical abuse,knowledge he
shouldn't have. We've seen this before.

509
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:05,510
Look at this. All right?

510
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,410
The first intervention is timid.

511
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,720
It's apprehensive,right? But
then he gets knocked down...

512
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:14,950
There's a moment of calm,and then
his entire body language changes.

513
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:17,620
I saw this exact same transformation
when adam left the station,

514
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:22,770
only it wasn't rage,it was,uh,arrogance.
Like the alter ego wanted me to know.

515
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,760
- Why?
- I don't know. Power,control.

516
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:26,960
All I know is the person that stared
me down over there was not adam.

517
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:29,470
He's not assertive like that.
He doesn't make eye contt.

518
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:34,480
So you think the stress of the interrogation blurred
the line between adam and his alter personality?

519
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:36,690
I think the unsub
surfaced for just a moment.

520
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:41,580
It knew the answer to the
question,realized adam wouldn't,and lied.

521
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,300
So adam and the woman in the
green dress are the same person?

522
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:49,040
We profiled the duo accurately,only the dominant
personalities and alter are inside of adam.

523
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,980
And adam has no idea he
killed all those people.

524
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,430
You could argue that adam
didn't kill those people.

525
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,450
A separate person inside of him did.

526
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,750
I don't even know what we do with this.

527
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:59,530
We take him into custody,we
let the courts decide.

528
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:08,340
I thought you were heading home.

529
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:12,740
I found this in your room.

530
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:15,360
- You went in my
room? What? - Yeah,i--

531
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:17,720
you don't remember the
fight with william browder,

532
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,990
You disappeared before
dan keller was killed,

533
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,780
- and you won't tell me where you've been.
- What are you saying?

534
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:24,860
Why do you have this?

535
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,120
It's not mine.

536
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,130
It was hidden in your closet.

537
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,390
Julie,this is
crazy! Ju--ohh!

538
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,830
Did--did a woman get
you involved in this?

539
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,290
No!

540
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,400
If you turn her in,then I can help you.

541
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:39,450
I didn't kill those people!

542
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,960
I want to believe you,adam.

543
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:44,060
Believme!

544
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:49,220
I think that we should
go to the police together.

545
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,490
- No!
- I'll be right there with you.

546
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,460
We'll figure this out.

547
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,280
Or i'll go by myself.

548
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:03,650
I said no.

549
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:10,700
Adam... What's going on?

550
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:18,260
You shouldn't be up here.

551
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:22,150
Adam... You're starting to scare me.

552
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,490
My name is amanda.

553
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:30,390
If you're in some kind of
trouble,hon,i can help you.

554
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,670
Adam doesn't need you anymore.

555
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:36,020
No! No! No!

556
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:49,010
Reid and morgan,take the roof.

557
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:52,050
We've got adam's room.

558
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,680
Hotchner! In the back!

559
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,450
Ok,guys,let's back up! Back up!Come on.

560
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:01,380
- Excuse me.
- Move,move!

561
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,240
We've got a woman down
at the back of the hotel.

562
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,720
Send medics as soon as possible.

563
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:07,310
Julie,can you hear me?

564
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:10,010
- Adam...
- Ok.

565
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,780
Look,help is on the way.
I need you not to move.

566
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:16,040
It wasn't... Him... Strange.

567
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:18,550
Julie,did he say where he was going?

568
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,980
- He called himself amanda.
- The alter personality.

569
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:22,680
Reid,you were right. Where would he go?

570
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:26,380
Not he. She. Amanda,she panicked.

571
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:28,210
She knew we would connect this to her.

572
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:30,920
Ok,ok,so she's feeling the pressure. She
obviously knows she's running out of time.

573
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:33,040
Where would she go?

574
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:40,520
She's gonna go after the
man these victims represent.

575
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:43,050
Garcia,please tell me you know
the whereabouts of mark harrison.

576
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:47,710
The skeezy wife-beating,child-abusing
scumbag never left corpus christi.

577
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:51,330
Sending his address to your p.d.

578
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,940
Go.

579
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:56,690
Medics!

580
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:27,080
- Amanda.
- Stay back.

581
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:29,760
- Put the knife down.
- Stand back or i'll kill him.

582
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,280
You do not want to do that.

583
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:33,920
You don't know what he did.

584
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:41,820
When adam's mother died,his stepfather needed
a new outlet for his aggression,didn't he?

585
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:47,510
He put adam in dresses. He
beat him. He touched him.

586
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:51,120
Adam was too weak to go
through all of that alone.

587
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:53,790
He was just a little boy.

588
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:56,950
He needed you to protect him.

589
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:59,780
I could take it.

590
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,050
I was stronger than he was.

591
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:05,770
He deserves to die.

592
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:09,260
Amanda. Amanda. That's
not for you to decide.

593
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:15,180
I swear to god,if you put
him down and you come with me,

594
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:20,820
I will get you and adam
the help that you guys need.

595
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:32,430
Adam will be sentenced
for what I've done.

596
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:37,070
No... I can't let that happen.

597
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,560
Amanda. If you kill
yourself,you kill adam.

598
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:43,400
I don't see how that's protecting him.

599
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:44,510
And you know what I know?

600
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:47,310
I know that all you want to do
in this world Is protect adam.

601
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,060
it's all I've ever done.

602
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:52,610
Then why don't you and
I help him together.

603
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:55,990
You can't help him.

604
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:59,090
I'm the only one.

605
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:03,080
I know what I have to do.

606
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:06,200
I will keep him safe forever.

607
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:16,930
Adam.

608
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:20,750
Adam.

609
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:26,820
Reid. He's gone.

610
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,730
It's time to go,kid.

611
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:48,900
Reid. What's eatin' you,man?

612
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:55,740
We've taken the victim into
custody and let the abuser go free.

613
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:59,850
I don't really-- I don't
sethat as much of a win.

614
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,980
A lot of lives are gonna be saved now that
amanda's off the street. You know that.

615
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:09,950
Yeah,i just...

616
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:14,290
I wish I could have noticed
the signs in time to save adam.

617
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,270
Come on,don't do that to yourself.

618
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:18,270
None of us could have noticed.

619
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:19,350
Our profile was right.

620
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:23,430
We just never considered that the team dynamic
could be locked inside one person's mind.

621
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,470
I should have.

622
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:35,540
Talk to me. What is this?

623
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,940
Tobias hankel.

624
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:44,880
Tobias hankel drugged and
tortured you for 2 days.

625
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:46,180
He almost killed you.

626
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,520
No,he didn't.

627
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:50,830
The alter persona of his
father did those things to me.

628
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:54,280
The real tobias hankel saved my life.

629
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,700
He brought me back from the dead.

630
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:00,020
And you think because of
tobias,somehow you owe adam?

631
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:06,420
I just--i know that he's still
locked in there somewhere.

632
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:17,440
Kid.

633
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:21,300
You're gonna have to accept the fact
that sometimes we can't save everyone.

634
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:36,510
Tell me,dr. Reid,how long will
you keep visiting me in here?

635
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:40,850
Until I find adam.

636
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:46,660
Why do you care?

637
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:50,670
He deserves a life. It's his.

638
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:54,800
So you're trying to... Wear
me down and release him?

639
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:59,620
No. I'm just waiting for
you to do the right thing.

640
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:05,540
Well,I'm afraid you'll be
waiting for a very long time.

641
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:28,670
Stephen king wrote,"monsters are
real,and ghosts are real,too."

642
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:31,350
"they live inside us.

643
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:34,010
And sometimes they win."
