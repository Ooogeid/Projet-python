1
00:00:06,675 --> 00:00:08,031
Good job today, Brenda.

2
00:00:08,156 --> 00:00:09,967
Thanks, Keith.
This was a great haul.

3
00:00:10,464 --> 00:00:12,401
They were really biting today.
It's been a while.

4
00:00:12,526 --> 00:00:15,064
Why don't you head back to town.
I want to put the rest in the smoker

5
00:00:15,189 --> 00:00:16,275
I'll drop you off

6
00:00:16,285 --> 00:00:17,904
No. I could do
with the walk.

7
00:00:18,336 --> 00:00:19,520
Get home to your wife.

8
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:22,064
You sure? Lisa wouldn't mind
if I waited for you.

9
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:24,236
I'll be fine.
Go home.

10
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:26,601
All right, well,
don't stay too late, all right?

11
00:00:26,978 --> 00:00:28,249
Ok. I'll see you tomorrow.

12
00:00:28,277 --> 00:00:29,711
All right. See you.

13
00:00:41,765 --> 00:00:42,811
Is anyone there?

14
00:00:46,627 --> 00:00:48,123
"is anyone there," Brenda?

15
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:50,631
Right. 'cause the homicidal
maniac hiding in the shadows

16
00:00:50,756 --> 00:00:52,920
Is really going to answer you.

17
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:02,520
Keith?

18
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,499
Stop messing around.
It's not funny.

19
00:01:39,961 --> 00:01:40,815
it's you.

20
00:01:41,233 --> 00:01:42,504
I thought someone was--

21
00:01:54,301 --> 00:01:55,720
JJ, that's not the point.

22
00:01:55,721 --> 00:01:57,422
Well, are you gonna call him?

23
00:01:57,978 --> 00:01:58,710
Maybe.

24
00:01:59,546 --> 00:02:00,278
Emily.

25
00:02:01,027 --> 00:02:04,077
Mick Rawson is an arrogant,

26
00:02:04,581 --> 00:02:06,722
Oversexed, egotistical

27
00:02:06,847 --> 00:02:10,870
Hot British dude with a sexy
accent, badge, and gun.

28
00:02:11,516 --> 00:02:12,738
Just your type.

29
00:02:13,223 --> 00:02:15,226
You know what? I don't
even get you sometimes.

30
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,742
It wouldn't go anywhere.

31
00:02:16,743 --> 00:02:17,710
You don't know that.

32
00:02:17,711 --> 00:02:19,179
I know our work schedules.

33
00:02:19,529 --> 00:02:21,747
Ok, you know what?
Will and I make it work.

34
00:02:25,871 --> 00:02:27,519
I know. I know. I know.
Don't say it.

35
00:02:27,644 --> 00:02:30,170
But when you see what's in here
And it's not my fault.

36
00:02:30,295 --> 00:02:32,021
They were calling
to me, I swear.

37
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,652
And they were all on sale.

38
00:02:33,896 --> 00:02:36,494
And when you think about it, that
means that I am helping the economy,

39
00:02:36,619 --> 00:02:38,088
Which is more than
I can say for you guys,

40
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:38,992
'cause no one else has bags.

41
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,410
Please tell me all of
those aren't for my son.

42
00:02:41,735 --> 00:02:42,867
They're not.
Good.

43
00:02:44,341 --> 00:02:45,539
This one is for Kevin.

44
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,403
What? It is my duty
as a fairy godmother

45
00:02:49,528 --> 00:02:51,842
To spoil the child.
And Henry is finally old enough

46
00:02:51,967 --> 00:02:54,489
To be fun when opening presents.
I'm not taking them back.

47
00:02:54,614 --> 00:02:56,477
Give me my coffee and no
one's gonna get hurt

48
00:02:57,179 --> 00:03:00,611
half-caf extra
shot venti, 2-pump nonfat,

49
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,340
Hold the whip
caramel macchiato.

50
00:03:02,465 --> 00:03:03,641
Next stop, Xanadu.

51
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:05,559
Wait.

52
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:07,636
Xana-don't.

53
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,730
Time to go to the ball, ladies.

54
00:03:12,095 --> 00:03:13,684
Maybe I should get a cat.

55
00:03:18,715 --> 00:03:19,772
Sorry to ruin your night.

56
00:03:19,897 --> 00:03:21,451
What, are you working
on wife number 4?

57
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,709
I see you people way too much.

58
00:03:24,522 --> 00:03:25,538
Let's get started.

59
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,937
All right. Anchorage
field office is asking us

60
00:03:28,062 --> 00:03:30,793
To investigate a series of
murders in Franklin, Alaska.

61
00:03:30,918 --> 00:03:32,503
There's 3 people dead
in less than a week

62
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:34,727
For a town with
a population of 1,476,

63
00:03:34,852 --> 00:03:36,008
That's fairly significant.

64
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,960
It's their first murder
investigation on record

65
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:39,019
Who are the victims?

66
00:03:39,869 --> 00:03:41,220
Jon Baker, a hunter.

67
00:03:41,542 --> 00:03:43,472
Dedaimia Swanson,
a schoolteacher.

68
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,613
Brenda bright, the first mate
on a fishing boat.

69
00:03:45,891 --> 00:03:47,231
There's a new victim
every 2 days.

70
00:03:47,232 --> 00:03:48,246
Any connections?

71
00:03:48,371 --> 00:03:50,646
Unfortunately, in a town this small,
Everyone's connected.

72
00:03:50,951 --> 00:03:52,290
Different kill methods.

73
00:03:52,415 --> 00:03:54,380
It says the first two victims
Were both shot with a rifle,

74
00:03:54,505 --> 00:03:56,278
But Brenda bright was
stabbed twice with an arrow?

75
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,837
Are we sure it's the same guy?

76
00:03:58,115 --> 00:04:00,165
All 3 victims were found
in heavily trafficked areas.

77
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,051
The unsub wants them found
sooner than later

78
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,431
Jon Baker's body was left
exposed to the elements,

79
00:04:04,556 --> 00:04:07,664
But the two women were buried
under mounds of trash. Why?

80
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,930
It could be a sign of remorse. Cover
their bodies so he doesn't have to face

81
00:04:10,055 --> 00:04:11,293
The reality of what he's done.

82
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:12,660
Or he thinks
that the women are trash

83
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:14,254
And he's just placed them
where he thinks they belong.

84
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,927
Well, we can't be sure
of anything yet.

85
00:04:16,052 --> 00:04:18,087
Franklin is an isolated
fishing community

86
00:04:18,212 --> 00:04:20,225
That's been hit really hard
by the current economy.

87
00:04:20,467 --> 00:04:23,317
Add to that a series of unsolved
murders and everyone's on edge.

88
00:04:23,442 --> 00:04:25,879
The local sheriff's out of his depth.
And Alaska hasn't handled

89
00:04:26,004 --> 00:04:28,020
a serial investigation since Robert
Hansen in the eighties

90
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,062
We'll fly out tonight.
Everybody can sleep on the plane.

91
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:31,352
Garcia, I need you with us.

92
00:04:31,806 --> 00:04:32,335
Sir?

93
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,496
I've tasked a satellite uplink

94
00:04:33,621 --> 00:04:34,899
And it's your job
to keep us connected.

95
00:04:35,161 --> 00:04:35,923
Yes, sir.

96
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,548
This town's already
on the brink,

97
00:04:37,673 --> 00:04:39,216
And if this pattern continues,
we've only got another day

98
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:41,318
Until the next murder.
Let's finish this fast.

99
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:37,488
"nature in her most dazzling
aspects or stupendous parts,

100
00:05:37,613 --> 00:05:40,125
"is but the background
and theater of the tragedy of man.

101
00:05:40,687 --> 00:05:41,589
John Morley.

102
00:05:43,015 --> 00:05:44,383
This guy's all over the map.

103
00:05:44,508 --> 00:05:47,973
Crosses sex and race boundaries.
He changed his kill method.

104
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,850
It says to me he's disorganized.

105
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:52,605
Yet there weren't prints
at any of the crime scenes,

106
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,229
And he isolated his victims.

107
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,231
Wearing gloves and making sure there
aren't any witnesses that's a no-brainer

108
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,534
But what concerns me is
the evolution of the kills.

109
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:00,519
Evolution?

110
00:06:01,326 --> 00:06:02,904
Well, he started
with easy prey.

111
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,655
Jon Baker was
in his mid sixties.

112
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,575
It's relatively low-risk
for a first-timer

113
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,450
Dedaimia Swanson
was in her early fifties.

114
00:06:08,807 --> 00:06:10,077
She wouldn't be that
difficult to overpower.

115
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:11,563
But he didn't have to overpower
either one of them.

116
00:06:11,688 --> 00:06:12,885
Both victims were shot.

117
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,284
Which is my point exactly.

118
00:06:15,091 --> 00:06:16,793
He killed them both
from a safe distance.

119
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:19,007
But Brenda bright was
younger, more athletic.

120
00:06:19,734 --> 00:06:21,358
She would have been able to
put up much more of a fight,

121
00:06:21,483 --> 00:06:22,591
So why not shoot her, too?

122
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,426
That supports
the disorganized theory

123
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:27,345
Maybe he didn't get what he wanted
from his first two victims.

124
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,866
Brenda bright
was an attractive woman.

125
00:06:28,991 --> 00:06:31,812
He used an arrow, but he
didn't shoot her with it.

126
00:06:31,937 --> 00:06:32,945
He stabbed her.

127
00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:34,964
I think we all know
what that means.

128
00:06:35,852 --> 00:06:37,440
When we land in Anchorage,
There'll be a float plane

129
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:39,922
to take us to Franklin. When we get
there, Morgan and Prentiss

130
00:06:40,047 --> 00:06:42,710
work the crime scene. We need to know
exactly how he ambushed his victims.

131
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,988
Reid and Rossi, the bodies.
Find out what you can there.

132
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,616
JJ and I will work victimology.
And, Garcia, town records.

133
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:48,825
Find us something we can use.

134
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,231
Of course, sir. I should
let everybody know

135
00:06:50,356 --> 00:06:52,579
That reception in the area
is unreliable at best.

136
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,896
I'm giving everybody satellite
phones for communication,

137
00:06:54,897 --> 00:06:57,496
And I've already preprogrammed
all your digits into speed dial.

138
00:06:57,621 --> 00:06:58,959
Guess who's lucky number 7.

139
00:07:30,248 --> 00:07:32,300
Welcome to Franklin.
I'm deputy flack.

140
00:07:32,549 --> 00:07:34,859
Are these the docks that Brenda bright
was working. The night she was killed?

141
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:36,720
All right,
we'll get started here

142
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:46,850
Agent Hotchner?

143
00:07:47,852 --> 00:07:48,852
Sheriff Rhodes.

144
00:07:48,853 --> 00:07:49,920
Very nice to meet you.

145
00:07:49,921 --> 00:07:51,255
Good to meet you, sir, ma'am.
Hi.

146
00:07:51,573 --> 00:07:53,256
So I cannot tell you
how grateful I am

147
00:07:53,754 --> 00:07:54,710
That you all could come.

148
00:07:54,835 --> 00:07:56,726
The people here are really
starting to act up.

149
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,997
I'm afraid our little town's
a bit of a powder keg.

150
00:07:59,122 --> 00:08:00,330
Where would you like us
to set up, sir?

151
00:08:00,331 --> 00:08:01,890
You see, there's not
much room at the station

152
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:03,840
Because that's also
the post office.

153
00:08:03,965 --> 00:08:06,088
But I have made arrangements
for you to work

154
00:08:06,213 --> 00:08:08,177
Out of Carol's tavern,
which is right over there.

155
00:08:09,213 --> 00:08:10,047
Thank you.

156
00:08:10,464 --> 00:08:11,917
Well, thank you.
Appreciate it.

157
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,671
It's pretty isolated out here.
How do you get basic supplies?

158
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:18,280
Float planes bring grocery
and hardware deliveries

159
00:08:18,281 --> 00:08:19,734
On a weekly basis,

160
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:22,452
and fishermen and hunters provide
the town's meat supply.

161
00:08:24,188 --> 00:08:25,986
I'm Craig Ramey.
You all the FBI?

162
00:08:25,987 --> 00:08:27,174
What gave us away?

163
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,755
You're sure packing an awful lot
of stuff for a fishing trip.

164
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,916
I'm not going fishing.
Getting the hell out of dodge

165
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,805
Before it's me or my wife
put in the ground

166
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,195
Did you know Brenda well?

167
00:08:35,678 --> 00:08:37,562
Everyone did.
She was sweet.

168
00:08:38,248 --> 00:08:40,801
She's pull a haul just as good
as any guy on these docks.

169
00:08:41,195 --> 00:08:43,304
As soon as I get my house
boarded up, I'm heading out.

170
00:08:43,305 --> 00:08:44,805
Suggest you do the same, Susan.

171
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,743
I can't say that I blame him.

172
00:08:49,376 --> 00:08:52,363
With what's been going on, I'm surprised
more people aren't trying to leave.

173
00:08:54,449 --> 00:08:57,017
This is Keith graves. He was
with Brenda the night she died.

174
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,848
Mr. Graves,

175
00:08:59,575 --> 00:09:02,064
Did you notice anything out of the
ordinary the night of the murder?

176
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,554
I offered to wait for her,

177
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:07,160
But she insisted I head
up to town without her.

178
00:09:07,161 --> 00:09:08,460
What were you two
doing that night?

179
00:09:08,585 --> 00:09:10,196
We finished
for the day. I left.

180
00:09:10,197 --> 00:09:13,042
She stuck around to clean the fish
that she wanted to take home.

181
00:09:13,447 --> 00:09:14,868
She usually walk home alone?

182
00:09:16,178 --> 00:09:18,339
Brenda said that walking
was good for the soul.

183
00:09:19,407 --> 00:09:20,632
How far is it into town?

184
00:09:21,148 --> 00:09:22,075
a half a mile.

185
00:09:22,923 --> 00:09:24,756
The unsub could have
waited for her anywhere.

186
00:09:25,584 --> 00:09:26,542
Appreciate your time.

187
00:09:29,392 --> 00:09:31,934
Sheriff asked me to keep
everyone on ice Till you got here.

188
00:09:32,254 --> 00:09:32,982
Still,

189
00:09:33,561 --> 00:09:36,141
I can't believe someone from Franklin
would be capable of this.

190
00:09:36,266 --> 00:09:39,088
What convinced you she was stabbed
with the arrow Instead of shot?

191
00:09:39,213 --> 00:09:40,904
Upward angle
at the point of entry.

192
00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:43,097
He would have had to been
shooting from beneath her.

193
00:09:44,205 --> 00:09:46,577
There wasn't much left.
Forest got to him first.

194
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:49,170
I found urine on the remains.

195
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:50,013
Urine?

196
00:09:50,138 --> 00:09:51,772
I thought it was
from the animals

197
00:09:51,897 --> 00:09:54,508
Who scavenged his body, but I got
the lab results back this morning.

198
00:09:54,509 --> 00:09:57,230
The urine was human.
Is he marking his victims?

199
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,231
Only found it on Jon.
Both the women were clean.

200
00:10:00,356 --> 00:10:01,720
Jon was shot 3 times.

201
00:10:01,845 --> 00:10:04,021
The unsub grazed him twice
and then hit him in the head.

202
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:05,818
Dedaimia Swanson
was only shot once.

203
00:10:05,819 --> 00:10:08,597
The first kill shows
hesitation, uncertainty.

204
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,324
He wasn't confident
taking the terminal shot.

205
00:10:11,325 --> 00:10:13,426
It was either accidental
or spur of the moment,

206
00:10:13,551 --> 00:10:15,404
But the second kill,
he only needed one shot.

207
00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:16,762
He's progressing quickly.

208
00:10:17,268 --> 00:10:18,484
Were you close
with the victims?

209
00:10:18,609 --> 00:10:21,000
An occupational hazard when
you're the only doctor in town.

210
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,935
I delivered Brenda.
Never thought I'd outlive her.

211
00:10:23,936 --> 00:10:25,552
Look at the cuts on her torso.

212
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:27,839
They're shallow
and non-penetrating.

213
00:10:27,964 --> 00:10:29,441
Not necessary for the murder.

214
00:10:29,442 --> 00:10:31,307
You know what? These
were made postmortem.

215
00:10:31,432 --> 00:10:34,472
He's playing with the bodies,
Experimenting with his methodology.

216
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:36,593
Someone incapable of remorse.

217
00:10:36,908 --> 00:10:38,532
We're dealing
with a psychopath.

218
00:10:38,657 --> 00:10:40,756
Have you determined whether
or not she was raped?

219
00:10:41,913 --> 00:10:43,471
I didn't even think to look.

220
00:10:52,433 --> 00:10:54,521
Your report says
the assault occurred here.

221
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:56,129
That's right. There was
a trail of blood

222
00:10:56,171 --> 00:10:57,800
Coming from that direction.

223
00:10:58,293 --> 00:10:59,549
I don't see any blood.

224
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,639
We covered it up.

225
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:02,072
You contaminated the scene?

226
00:11:02,192 --> 00:11:03,005
We had to.

227
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,988
We've got a rabid bear in the woods.
It's been rippings maller game to shreds.

228
00:11:06,108 --> 00:11:07,551
A creature like that smells blood,

229
00:11:07,564 --> 00:11:09,235
He'll come into town, no hesitation.

230
00:11:09,355 --> 00:11:11,934
Ok, you said the other two victims
were found similar to this?

231
00:11:12,054 --> 00:11:14,618
Jon was found
on the edge of the woods.

232
00:11:14,619 --> 00:11:17,420
Dedaimia was up by crest falls.

233
00:11:17,421 --> 00:11:18,769
It's a popular hiking route.

234
00:11:18,808 --> 00:11:20,289
Who would know their routines?

235
00:11:21,069 --> 00:11:22,358
Everyone.

236
00:11:24,858 --> 00:11:26,695
Cup of coffee, Jace?

237
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:34,770
What are you doing?

238
00:11:34,771 --> 00:11:38,040
Trying to make this place
a little less analog.

239
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:41,489
Sorry. I forget my hacker
jokes aren't funny.

240
00:11:41,609 --> 00:11:43,079
My name is Penelope.

241
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,394
I'm the one who doesn't
carry a weapon,

242
00:11:45,514 --> 00:11:46,816
Aside from my biting wit.

243
00:11:46,817 --> 00:11:49,835
And my job includes combining
my kick-ass systems

244
00:11:49,955 --> 00:11:52,513
With your sheriff's
department database

245
00:11:52,633 --> 00:11:54,590
To get the skinny
on your neighbors and you.

246
00:11:55,042 --> 00:11:57,293
Or you could just ask us
what you want to know.

247
00:11:57,294 --> 00:12:00,169
I mean, isn't it better
to just talk to us directly

248
00:12:00,398 --> 00:12:02,564
Than look up our dirt secretly?

249
00:12:02,565 --> 00:12:04,797
No. Because in my experience,

250
00:12:04,917 --> 00:12:08,103
The information superhighway
never lies and people do.

251
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,805
Your name would be?

252
00:12:09,925 --> 00:12:13,343
Josh. My mom Carol,
she owns the place.

253
00:12:13,344 --> 00:12:15,745
It goes like this.

254
00:12:15,746 --> 00:12:17,047
Here we are.

255
00:12:17,048 --> 00:12:19,310
Joshua Beardsley, age 23,

256
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,118
Born right here in Franklin, AK.

257
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:23,421
Moved to Anchorage for
middle and High School.

258
00:12:23,422 --> 00:12:25,423
Majored in hotel
management at Seattle u.

259
00:12:25,424 --> 00:12:27,959
And you moved back home
a few weeks ago.

260
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,761
Perfect timing, huh?

261
00:12:29,762 --> 00:12:31,363
I come home, people start dying.

262
00:12:31,364 --> 00:12:33,932
Hmm. That's when I check
your criminal record.

263
00:12:33,933 --> 00:12:36,468
And you, my friend,
are clean as a whistle.

264
00:12:36,469 --> 00:12:38,036
What does that even mean?

265
00:12:38,037 --> 00:12:39,238
No idea.

266
00:12:39,239 --> 00:12:41,808
No dirt, anyway,
so, I guess I'm safe, then?

267
00:12:41,809 --> 00:12:43,096
For now.

268
00:12:44,045 --> 00:12:45,979
Those two got into it last night.

269
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,949
Bob here, he's our newest
resident, so, uh,

270
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,914
Tom figures, well, this is the guy
who's doing all the killings.

271
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:55,089
He decides to smash him over
the head with a bottle of booze.

272
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:56,991
Look, I don't know what to do.

273
00:12:56,992 --> 00:12:58,693
Have you thought about having
a kind of town hall meeting

274
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,662
Where you get everybody together
and talk about the facts of the case?

275
00:13:00,663 --> 00:13:02,464
The town's too spread out.

276
00:13:02,465 --> 00:13:05,410
I mean, everybody's doing what
they can just to get by, you know?

277
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:08,258
Sheriff, I know people move to these
remote locations to be left alone,

278
00:13:08,378 --> 00:13:10,413
But what happened last night
is gonna keep happening,

279
00:13:10,533 --> 00:13:13,041
And people are going to start taking
matters into their own hands.

280
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,243
Well, I can keep order
in my own town,

281
00:13:15,801 --> 00:13:17,278
But people around here, I mean,

282
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,830
This is Alaska, man.

283
00:13:19,492 --> 00:13:20,781
They do what they want.

284
00:13:25,986 --> 00:13:28,675
He's already experimenting
with his victims.

285
00:13:28,795 --> 00:13:31,291
He violated Brenda bright
with an arrow.

286
00:13:31,292 --> 00:13:33,594
And he's inciting panic. People
who have lived here most of their lives

287
00:13:33,595 --> 00:13:34,695
Are packing up to leave.

288
00:13:34,696 --> 00:13:36,781
Can you blame them?
We have a psychopath

289
00:13:36,806 --> 00:13:38,900
Whose hunting ground is
a town of 1,400 people.

290
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:42,138
Most of them grew up learning to
kill animals and start fires.

291
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:44,473
It sounds like
your basic survival skills.

292
00:13:44,474 --> 00:13:46,409
No. They're hunting skills.

293
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,645
Think about it.
The marksmanship,

294
00:13:48,646 --> 00:13:50,814
The urine-- it makes sense.

295
00:13:50,815 --> 00:13:52,081
The urine makes sense?

296
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:53,449
It's a hunter's trick.

297
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:56,367
You urinate downwind
to keep the animals away.

298
00:13:56,487 --> 00:13:58,021
He tried to preserve
Jon Baker's body

299
00:13:58,022 --> 00:13:59,423
So it would be discovered intact.

300
00:13:59,424 --> 00:14:02,126
All right, so we've got
a psychopath with hunting skills

301
00:14:02,127 --> 00:14:04,495
Who knows the routines
of everyone in town.

302
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:07,413
How are we supposed to
keep everyone safe?

303
00:14:07,533 --> 00:14:09,401
Sheriff, I suggest
you institute a curfew

304
00:14:09,521 --> 00:14:11,169
Until we have the unsub in custody.

305
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:12,203
Nobody out after dark.

306
00:14:12,204 --> 00:14:14,453
I'll have one of my deputies
Patrolling around the clock.

307
00:14:14,573 --> 00:14:16,474
Garcia, how's it coming
with town records?

308
00:14:16,475 --> 00:14:18,443
I've run everyone who's
been printed through CODIS.

309
00:14:18,444 --> 00:14:21,045
Nothing's come up so far.
I'm gonna pull an all-nighter,

310
00:14:21,046 --> 00:14:22,513
Finish going through
the town records.

311
00:14:22,514 --> 00:14:24,172
Should have background checks
by sunrise.

312
00:14:24,206 --> 00:14:26,384
Good. The rest of us
should get some sleep,

313
00:14:26,385 --> 00:14:27,552
Start fresh in the morning.

314
00:14:27,553 --> 00:14:29,822
I've got 4 of the upstairs
rooms available.

315
00:14:29,823 --> 00:14:31,425
Uh, 4?

316
00:14:31,426 --> 00:14:32,793
Come on, that's the best we can do.

317
00:14:32,794 --> 00:14:35,796
Your team is double
the size of my department.

318
00:14:35,797 --> 00:14:37,030
I'll see you in the morning.

319
00:14:37,031 --> 00:14:38,065
Good night.

320
00:14:38,066 --> 00:14:39,099
It looks like we'll
have to double up.

321
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,534
I'm not sleeping with Reid.

322
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,437
Dibs.

323
00:14:45,606 --> 00:14:48,407
What do you mean, you're
sharing a room with Morgan?

324
00:14:48,408 --> 00:14:50,109
Oh, you're jealous.

325
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:52,111
Jealous? Why?

326
00:14:52,112 --> 00:14:55,548
Because you're
bedding down with a...

327
00:14:55,549 --> 00:14:57,984
Muscle-bound, modern-day 007?

328
00:14:57,985 --> 00:15:00,186
Mm, he's more like Jason Bourne.

329
00:15:00,187 --> 00:15:02,422
Oh, what's there
to be jealous about?

330
00:15:02,423 --> 00:15:04,258
He took the floor.

331
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:06,060
Ok. Just...
Just make sure

332
00:15:06,061 --> 00:15:08,618
He keeps his weapon holstered, OK?

333
00:15:09,597 --> 00:15:12,799
Why are you up right now,
anyway? It's so late.

334
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,535
Actually, it's early.
I just got to Quantico.

335
00:15:15,536 --> 00:15:17,904
Ohh. Damn time zones.

336
00:15:18,957 --> 00:15:19,806
Hello?

337
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,074
Hello?

338
00:15:21,909 --> 00:15:23,356
Hello.

339
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,580
Ohh...Frak.

340
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,340
Oh, come on, baby.

341
00:15:52,341 --> 00:15:54,141
Come on, come on, come on.

342
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,882
Nice one, Garcie.

343
00:16:49,465 --> 00:16:50,799
Look at me.

344
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,868
Hey.
You're gonna be OK.

345
00:16:52,869 --> 00:16:54,103
My name's Penelope.

346
00:16:54,104 --> 00:16:55,473
You're gonna be OK.
You're gonna be OK.

347
00:16:55,593 --> 00:16:56,900
Just keep looking at me.

348
00:17:00,744 --> 00:17:02,211
Help!

349
00:17:02,212 --> 00:17:03,746
Help!

350
00:17:03,747 --> 00:17:05,248
Please!

351
00:17:05,249 --> 00:17:08,906
Somebody come help here!

352
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:10,686
Someone is hurt!

353
00:17:10,687 --> 00:17:12,255
Please!

354
00:17:13,896 --> 00:17:16,363
His name's Craig Ramey.
Fisherman.

355
00:17:16,483 --> 00:17:18,106
Morgan and I met him this morning.

356
00:17:18,226 --> 00:17:20,634
He was packing up to leave.
He's accelerating his schedule.

357
00:17:20,635 --> 00:17:22,203
We should have had another day.
Why change that?

358
00:17:22,204 --> 00:17:24,438
Ramey was pretty vocal about
wanting to get out of town.

359
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:26,507
If the unsub knew that,
he could have struck early

360
00:17:26,508 --> 00:17:28,008
To prevent his target
from getting away.

361
00:17:28,009 --> 00:17:29,609
There has to be more
to it than that.

362
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:32,579
He brought the body to
the tavern we're staying at.

363
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,273
He's telling us
that he's not afraid of us.

364
00:17:34,298 --> 00:17:35,482
He's gaining confidence.

365
00:17:35,483 --> 00:17:37,065
He switched to a hunting knife.

366
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:38,988
Looks like a jagged edge.

367
00:17:39,108 --> 00:17:41,921
There's more physical damage,
too, like he was cut open.

368
00:17:41,922 --> 00:17:43,929
I won't know
until Dr. Johnson does an autopsy,

369
00:17:43,955 --> 00:17:46,325
But I'd be willing to bet he took
a piece of the victim with him.

370
00:17:46,326 --> 00:17:47,593
What kind of piece?

371
00:17:47,594 --> 00:17:49,362
It's hard to say,
but judging from the location,

372
00:17:49,363 --> 00:17:51,831
I would guess liver or spleen.

373
00:17:57,871 --> 00:17:59,638
He was alive.

374
00:18:01,378 --> 00:18:02,295
What?

375
00:18:03,276 --> 00:18:05,010
He was still alive.

376
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:07,480
Baby, there's nothing else
you could have done.

377
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:10,015
I felt him leave.

378
00:18:10,627 --> 00:18:12,817
He was there one second,

379
00:18:12,818 --> 00:18:16,221
And then-- just a body.

380
00:18:16,222 --> 00:18:20,058
I'm really sorry that you
had to see all of that.

381
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:24,329
Derek, I--I didn't see, I was in it.

382
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,498
I was sort of used to
seeing horrible things

383
00:18:26,499 --> 00:18:28,534
From the safety
of my screens every day,

384
00:18:28,535 --> 00:18:32,005
But this was...
Right there.

385
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,476
Why didn't you go and find someone
before you ran out there?

386
00:18:37,712 --> 00:18:41,881
Because when I got shot,
I remember thinking

387
00:18:41,882 --> 00:18:44,249
The last thing I'm ever
gonna see in this life

388
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,583
Is the man who killed me,

389
00:18:45,584 --> 00:18:47,485
And I couldn't let
that happen to him.

390
00:18:47,486 --> 00:18:49,654
He had to see something
good before he died.

391
00:18:49,655 --> 00:18:52,890
You ran right towards the unsub.
You could have been killed.

392
00:18:52,891 --> 00:18:54,759
I know that.
Don't treat me like I'm the victim.

393
00:18:55,892 --> 00:18:57,194
All right. I'm sorry.

394
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:00,531
I want to ask you a couple
of questions, all right?

395
00:19:00,532 --> 00:19:02,166
No. I--I told you everything I saw.

396
00:19:02,167 --> 00:19:03,668
You said the man's face
was mostly in shadow,

397
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:05,135
But there was also a lot
of blood on it.

398
00:19:05,136 --> 00:19:07,171
You might have seen more
than you actually realize.

399
00:19:07,172 --> 00:19:10,074
No. Cognitive interviews, breaking
someone's death down to a science

400
00:19:10,075 --> 00:19:11,975
And statistic--
that is your world, Derek,

401
00:19:11,976 --> 00:19:14,077
Not mine!
I will help from mine.

402
00:19:14,078 --> 00:19:14,855
Penelope!

403
00:19:14,889 --> 00:19:17,435
Derek, let her go.

404
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,617
Will you look after her, please?

405
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:23,152
Yeah, of course.

406
00:19:33,396 --> 00:19:35,630
Was Garcia able to give you
any new information?

407
00:19:35,631 --> 00:19:37,498
She's given all she can.

408
00:19:37,499 --> 00:19:39,267
This guy's taunting us.
He's one step ahead.

409
00:19:39,268 --> 00:19:41,503
I think you're giving him
more credit than he deserves.

410
00:19:41,504 --> 00:19:43,602
It's like Emily said on the plane,
he's all over the place.

411
00:19:43,722 --> 00:19:45,862
The victimology's inconsistent,
The methodology's evolving,

412
00:19:45,982 --> 00:19:48,178
The first kill was sloppy,
hesitant, and unplanned.

413
00:19:48,298 --> 00:19:49,546
It was an accident,

414
00:19:49,547 --> 00:19:52,382
But it triggered a sexual response.
He got off on it.

415
00:19:52,383 --> 00:19:54,284
And he knew then and there
he had to kill again.

416
00:19:54,285 --> 00:19:55,986
He learned how to get
the job done more efficiently.

417
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:57,254
Yeah, but why the organs?

418
00:19:57,255 --> 00:19:59,881
Consumption typically
indicates a desire

419
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:01,423
To keep the victim with them.

420
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,862
He's having trouble letting go.

421
00:20:02,879 --> 00:20:05,595
We're probably looking for someone
with severe abandonment issues.

422
00:20:05,596 --> 00:20:08,096
It'll be light soon.
Let's get everybody together

423
00:20:08,097 --> 00:20:09,898
And go over what we know.

424
00:20:11,433 --> 00:20:13,892
We're looking for
an emotionally immature male,

425
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:15,728
Probably in his
mid to late twenties,

426
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:17,762
Who suffered a traumatic loss.

427
00:20:17,882 --> 00:20:19,272
Now, this loss could be anything.

428
00:20:19,273 --> 00:20:22,376
Death of a parent, separation of
a spouse, a loved one who moved away.

429
00:20:22,377 --> 00:20:24,645
Something that made the unsub
feel abandoned and alone.

430
00:20:24,646 --> 00:20:27,311
He'll have extensive
hunting experience.

431
00:20:27,431 --> 00:20:29,783
The bodies were buried
not because of remorse,

432
00:20:29,784 --> 00:20:32,786
They were buried to protect them
from wild animals.

433
00:20:32,787 --> 00:20:34,955
His familiarity with
the victims' routines

434
00:20:34,956 --> 00:20:38,191
Suggests the unsub has lived
here for most of his life.

435
00:20:38,192 --> 00:20:40,841
He also has extensive knowledge
Of the landscape and surroundings.

436
00:20:40,961 --> 00:20:42,929
So we should split up
and cover the town.

437
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:46,388
Focus on younger residents with
a history of petty crimes and assaults.

438
00:20:46,508 --> 00:20:47,900
You should look in their trash,

439
00:20:47,901 --> 00:20:49,968
Fireplaces, even in laundry.

440
00:20:49,969 --> 00:20:52,738
Look for signs of bloody clothes
or even cuts and bruises.

441
00:20:52,739 --> 00:20:54,665
One of the victims may have
gotten in a good blow or two

442
00:20:54,695 --> 00:20:55,764
Before they died.

443
00:20:55,808 --> 00:20:57,876
Bring in anyone who seems
to have something to hide.

444
00:20:57,877 --> 00:20:59,444
The unsub has already
broken patterns,

445
00:20:59,445 --> 00:21:01,480
So he could strike again
at any time.

446
00:21:01,481 --> 00:21:03,081
Sheriff, you and I need
to look at the school,

447
00:21:03,082 --> 00:21:05,284
Talk to the teacher, see if
she remembers any students exhibiting

448
00:21:05,285 --> 00:21:07,519
Early signs of homicidal tendencies.

449
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,154
Let's move.

450
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:12,254
Dedaimia was only one month away
from retirement.

451
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:14,129
I can't believe she's gone.

452
00:21:14,598 --> 00:21:16,122
We're very sorry for your loss.

453
00:21:16,247 --> 00:21:18,333
I need to ask
about your former students.

454
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:21,307
Do you remember any of them
enjoying hunting too much,

455
00:21:21,607 --> 00:21:23,156
so much that it worried you?

456
00:21:23,409 --> 00:21:25,482
All the boys around here
like it too much.

457
00:21:25,607 --> 00:21:27,702
They have competitions
to see who's the better shot.

458
00:21:28,013 --> 00:21:31,035
This would have been extreme.
Do you remember anyone who

459
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:34,258
might have tortured animals or played
with them before he killed them?

460
00:21:36,852 --> 00:21:38,421
That sound like someone you know?

461
00:21:38,903 --> 00:21:42,842
I've never seen anyone enjoy hunting
as much as Joshua Beardsley.

462
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,852
- He's the tavern owner's son?
- Yes.

463
00:21:44,977 --> 00:21:46,679
The youngest boy
in town to bag a deer.

464
00:21:47,031 --> 00:21:50,350
That's all he ever talked about.
He hunted something nearly every day.

465
00:21:50,664 --> 00:21:52,304
He was born and raised here.

466
00:21:52,429 --> 00:21:54,562
He returned a couple of weeks ago
after his dad died.

467
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:55,902
How old is he?

468
00:21:56,027 --> 00:21:57,106
- 23?
- Sure.

469
00:21:57,655 --> 00:21:59,425
- We need to talk to him.
- All right.

470
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,550
Thank you.

471
00:22:01,382 --> 00:22:02,577
What's this about?

472
00:22:05,355 --> 00:22:06,355
The strike

473
00:22:06,874 --> 00:22:08,480
was above the gut.

474
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:12,664
It keeps the meat from spoiling.
Isn't that right?

475
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:15,078
On a deer, maybe.

476
00:22:15,992 --> 00:22:17,752
Doubt it'd be the same for a human.

477
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,103
But then
he did something interesting.

478
00:22:21,122 --> 00:22:24,175
He took the victim's spleen.
Now, tell me,

479
00:22:26,091 --> 00:22:27,532
why would he do that?

480
00:22:27,861 --> 00:22:28,763
No idea.

481
00:22:31,649 --> 00:22:33,559
Let's stop playing games, Joshua.

482
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:36,062
Answer my questions
and maybe I'll believe you.

483
00:22:40,283 --> 00:22:42,557
It's a native hunting tradition,
isn't it?

484
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:46,061
Eat part of the kill.

485
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,659
- Gain the life force of your prey.
- Not many people know that.

486
00:22:50,288 --> 00:22:51,744
I'm not many people.

487
00:22:52,878 --> 00:22:55,581
- Where did you learn to hunt?
- Bagged my first deer when I was 7.

488
00:22:56,365 --> 00:22:57,522
That's pretty young.

489
00:22:57,647 --> 00:22:59,377
My dad taught me
how to live off the land.

490
00:22:59,954 --> 00:23:02,839
I ate the heart of my first kill.
That proves you're a true hunter

491
00:23:05,286 --> 00:23:06,305
So, you,

492
00:23:06,657 --> 00:23:07,760
enjoy hunting?

493
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,262
It's my favorite thing to do.

494
00:23:09,669 --> 00:23:11,368
Then would you say

495
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:13,891
you take pleasure in the kill?

496
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,101
Doesn't everyone?

497
00:23:16,751 --> 00:23:17,923
Actually, no...

498
00:23:19,306 --> 00:23:20,189
They don't.

499
00:23:27,429 --> 00:23:28,542
What do you think?

500
00:23:29,468 --> 00:23:30,569
I'm not sure.

501
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:34,245
He fits the profile, but he's acting
like a man with nothing to hide.

502
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,706
The attack cycle's accelerating.
He should strike tonight.

503
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:39,459
And if he doesn't,
we know we've got our guy in custody.

504
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:40,585
What if he does?

505
00:23:41,011 --> 00:23:42,086
I hate to say it,

506
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,672
but half this town matches most
of your profile.

507
00:23:47,331 --> 00:23:48,972
What are you guys working on?

508
00:23:49,097 --> 00:23:51,351
Hotch asked if we'd go through
Garcia's background profiles,

509
00:23:51,476 --> 00:23:53,749
try to find a link between Joshua
and the 4 victims.

510
00:23:53,874 --> 00:23:56,184
- You find anything?
- They all had hunting licenses.

511
00:23:57,312 --> 00:23:58,561
Needle, meet haystack.

512
00:23:58,827 --> 00:24:01,689
- We need the big guns.
- Ripped and ready to rumble.

513
00:24:03,941 --> 00:24:06,683
- Maybe you should sit this one out.
- No, Jaje, I'm OK.

514
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,987
Put this bastard where he belongs.

515
00:24:11,487 --> 00:24:12,624
Joshua Beardsley?

516
00:24:13,069 --> 00:24:14,577
Yeah. We think he's our unsub.

517
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:16,662
- No, he's not.
- He fits the profile.

518
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,874
Abandonment issue triggered by his
father recent death. Hunting experience,

519
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:21,793
Experimentation with animals.

520
00:24:23,077 --> 00:24:24,295
You arrested my son?

521
00:24:24,929 --> 00:24:27,006
We brought him in as a precaution.

522
00:24:32,066 --> 00:24:34,555
- I'm telling you, it's not him.
- What makes you so sure?

523
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,350
- 'cause the unsub ran away from me.
- Of course{\ he ran}. He knew you were FBI.

524
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:39,769
Joshua knows I'm a techie.
He knows I don't carry a weapon.

525
00:24:40,164 --> 00:24:42,473
If he was the unsub,
I'd be dead right now.

526
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:45,836
How can you be listening to any of this,
Steve?

527
00:24:45,961 --> 00:24:47,693
You know Joshua would never do this.

528
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:50,530
I never thought any of us
were capable of doing this.

529
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:52,787
But 4 people are dead, Carol.

530
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:58,454
You don't know him.
He's a good boy.

531
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:01,374
He's a good boy who recently lost his
father, it's a lot of emotional stress.

532
00:25:02,011 --> 00:25:03,709
It's been tough, but we're coping.

533
00:25:04,501 --> 00:25:06,796
- He's doing fine.
- Why did he move back to town?

534
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:10,091
I needed him here to help with the inn.
I can't handle it on my own.

535
00:25:11,438 --> 00:25:13,032
And how did that make him feel,

536
00:25:13,157 --> 00:25:15,346
having to drop everything
and move back home?

537
00:25:18,922 --> 00:25:20,017
He didn't do this.

538
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,523
We need to be sure.

539
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,397
I'm sure.
I'm his mother.

540
00:25:25,507 --> 00:25:28,401
It's one night. If nothing happens,
you pick him up in the morning.

541
00:25:31,964 --> 00:25:33,007
Wait a minute.

542
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:35,105
You said the unsub
has abandonment issues.

543
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,062
And Craig Ramey was leaving town,
right?

544
00:25:37,187 --> 00:25:39,078
Yeah, he couldn't wait
to get out of town.

545
00:25:41,738 --> 00:25:42,746
Let's see.

546
00:25:43,426 --> 00:25:47,363
Dedaimia Swanson was retiring
in a month. She was moving to Florida.

547
00:25:47,488 --> 00:25:48,933
What about the other two?

548
00:25:49,382 --> 00:25:51,913
Jon Baker just bought property
in Fairbanks,

549
00:25:52,038 --> 00:25:53,694
And he and his wife just separated.

550
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:55,725
She just filed the divorce papers.

551
00:25:56,042 --> 00:25:58,389
Well, welcome back, red delicious.

552
00:25:59,184 --> 00:26:01,856
Take a bite out of this. So far,
3 of our victims Were on the fast

553
00:26:01,981 --> 00:26:04,228
track to getting out of town.
And let's see...

554
00:26:04,364 --> 00:26:06,480
Connect 4.
Brenda just accepted a job in Seattle.

555
00:26:06,766 --> 00:26:09,291
Anyone else look like
they might be leaving town?

556
00:26:09,923 --> 00:26:11,447
I got one. Kat Allen.

557
00:26:11,572 --> 00:26:14,669
She was accepted to the summer honors
program at the university of Bloomington.

558
00:26:14,794 --> 00:26:17,306
She currently works as a waitress
at big John's coffeehouse.

559
00:26:17,431 --> 00:26:19,410
- Penelope, you are...
- So ready to go home.

560
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:40,014
We're looking for Kat Allen.

561
00:26:40,295 --> 00:26:41,295
I'm Kat.

562
00:26:44,737 --> 00:26:45,737
Can we talk?

563
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,995
It was completely unexpected.

564
00:26:48,879 --> 00:26:50,192
Never been married.

565
00:26:50,707 --> 00:26:52,559
I'd given up on ever having kids.

566
00:26:54,434 --> 00:26:56,280
Do you mind my asking
who the father is?

567
00:26:57,348 --> 00:27:00,743
A guy I met on a cruise.
He doesn't want anything to do with her.

568
00:27:01,297 --> 00:27:03,746
But I do. I want to be able
to give her a good life,

569
00:27:03,969 --> 00:27:05,289
I'm going back to school.

570
00:27:06,901 --> 00:27:09,085
Did you tell anyone
that you were leaving?

571
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:11,225
Yeah. A couple of people.

572
00:27:11,553 --> 00:27:12,748
I don't know...

573
00:27:13,721 --> 00:27:15,258
My mom. My boss.

574
00:27:15,631 --> 00:27:18,261
- We{\'re going to} need you to come with us.
- Why? What's this about?

575
00:27:18,874 --> 00:27:20,972
It's just for tonight.
It's for your protection.

576
00:27:34,625 --> 00:27:35,625
Damn it.

577
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,398
The neighbors saw the door open,
called it in.

578
00:28:27,379 --> 00:28:30,191
He went from ambushing people in public
to home invasion.

579
00:28:30,316 --> 00:28:32,020
That's a pretty big change in M.O.

580
00:28:32,303 --> 00:28:34,319
This one's personal.
It's angry.

581
00:28:34,717 --> 00:28:36,628
Her intestines
are splayed out everywhere.

582
00:28:36,753 --> 00:28:39,194
Yeah. And the blood on her face
is smeared, not splattered.

583
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:41,688
He played with the body.
He mutilated her.

584
00:28:42,696 --> 00:28:44,781
If this guy's
killing people leaving town,

585
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,957
why didn't he attack Kat Allen?

586
00:28:47,082 --> 00:28:49,441
'cause we had her in protective custody.
He couldn't get to her,

587
00:28:49,566 --> 00:28:52,313
- he moved on to another target.
- A target who broke her routine.

588
00:28:52,629 --> 00:28:55,733
Carol was scheduled to be at the tavern{\ tonight}.
How did the unsub know she was here?

589
00:28:55,992 --> 00:28:57,151
He was stalking her.

590
00:28:57,668 --> 00:29:00,613
- He chose Carol for a different reason.
- Why? What's changed?

591
00:29:06,773 --> 00:29:08,637
You guys finally realize
I'm innocent?

592
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,458
- Please have a seat.
- More questions?

593
00:29:13,231 --> 00:29:14,251
You serious?

594
00:29:14,672 --> 00:29:17,320
- I'm telling you, I didn't do this.
- We know that, son.

595
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:19,298
Please, sit down.

596
00:29:19,628 --> 00:29:20,674
What's going on?

597
00:29:24,211 --> 00:29:26,121
The killer struck again last night.

598
00:29:26,578 --> 00:29:27,855
Oh, God.

599
00:29:28,371 --> 00:29:29,637
Who did he get?

600
00:29:33,223 --> 00:29:34,980
Why are you guys
only telling me this?

601
00:29:39,504 --> 00:29:40,688
Where's my mom?

602
00:29:47,321 --> 00:29:48,856
No, that's impossible.

603
00:29:49,302 --> 00:29:52,325
She was just here.
I just talked to her!

604
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:53,791
I'm sorry{\, Joshua}.

605
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,255
She's gone.

606
00:29:58,876 --> 00:29:59,922
You're lying.

607
00:30:00,622 --> 00:30:01,966
I wish we were.

608
00:30:02,943 --> 00:30:04,677
- I need to see her.
- Not right now.

609
00:30:05,269 --> 00:30:09,125
- You don't think of her that way.
- We know you need time to mourn,

610
00:30:09,617 --> 00:30:12,090
but the fact of the matter is,
the man who did this

611
00:30:12,348 --> 00:30:15,146
is still out there, and we think
that you can help us find him.

612
00:30:16,852 --> 00:30:18,505
You had me locked up

613
00:30:19,243 --> 00:30:20,438
while she was...

614
00:30:23,661 --> 00:30:26,198
- I could have helped her.
- If you had gone to her,

615
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,255
there's a good chance
you'd both be dead.

616
00:30:28,677 --> 00:30:30,327
Now we need your help.

617
00:30:31,419 --> 00:30:33,080
- Why me?
- The murders began

618
00:30:33,421 --> 00:30:36,339
when you returned to town. Now,
up until now, he's only targeted people

619
00:30:36,464 --> 00:30:39,795
who trying to leave, but for some reason,
with your mother, it was personal.

620
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,655
The pressure's on.
The FBI is here.

621
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:44,245
In that situation, a serial killer wants
to finish what he started,

622
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:46,460
he goes after the true target
of his cause.

623
00:30:46,585 --> 00:30:47,585
Personal?

624
00:30:47,751 --> 00:30:50,997
Can you think of anyone who had
a grudge against her? Anyone at all?

625
00:30:51,122 --> 00:30:53,083
How about anyone
with a grudge against you?

626
00:30:53,786 --> 00:30:55,686
No. Everybody loved her.

627
00:30:57,761 --> 00:31:00,272
The man that we're looking for
has severe abandonment issues.

628
00:31:00,397 --> 00:31:01,859
Now, can you think of a time

629
00:31:02,214 --> 00:31:04,077
when you
or your mother left somebody,

630
00:31:04,202 --> 00:31:07,031
Maybe like a bad break-up
or a fight that ended a friendship?

631
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:10,618
Did your mother ever take anyone
in at the inn who had family problems,

632
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:12,151
Maybe someone who had been

633
00:31:12,276 --> 00:31:14,847
kicked out
or lost someone unexpectedly?

634
00:31:17,422 --> 00:31:20,617
No. No, no, no, no,
there was nothing like that.

635
00:31:20,659 --> 00:31:23,047
Uh, listen, can I go see my mom now?

636
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:25,466
Josh. Josh, you need
to let these people help.

637
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,366
No, I need...
I need to see my mom.

638
00:31:27,408 --> 00:31:29,132
Well, let's have someone take you.

639
00:31:29,174 --> 00:31:30,867
It's OK.
I know the way.

640
00:31:36,188 --> 00:31:37,958
Did you see his behavior shift

641
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,010
from wanting to help us
to wanting to leave? He's lying.

642
00:31:41,052 --> 00:31:43,422
Because he knows who the unsub is.

643
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:47,103
I got one of my deputies
tailing Joshua.

644
00:31:47,459 --> 00:31:49,817
If he does something stupid,
we're gonna know.

645
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:52,513
There's got to be a connection
we're missing. Garcia, anything?

646
00:31:52,555 --> 00:31:54,125
Their lives have been torn apart,

647
00:31:54,167 --> 00:31:56,347
figuratively and literally,
and I can't find anything.

648
00:31:56,389 --> 00:31:57,401
Try again.

649
00:31:57,443 --> 00:31:59,965
I'm hacking into his college
database as we speak.

650
00:32:00,007 --> 00:32:02,514
Maybe there's something about his
life in Seattle I may have missed.

651
00:32:02,556 --> 00:32:04,780
- Good. All right, why Carol?
- Why the mutilation?

652
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:06,891
- Why the overkill?
- Mutilation?

653
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:10,079
You said you found the remains
of mutilated animals

654
00:32:10,121 --> 00:32:12,495
- in the woods from a rabid bear?
- That's right.

655
00:32:12,537 --> 00:32:14,682
- Did you take pictures of them?
- Of course we did.

656
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,959
We documented everything
for identification.

657
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:20,645
We'll need to see those
pictures right away.

658
00:32:20,687 --> 00:32:22,570
Sheriff, we need
to adjust the profile.

659
00:32:22,612 --> 00:32:23,862
What do you mean?

660
00:32:23,904 --> 00:32:26,777
These animals weren't
mutilated by a rabid bear.

661
00:32:26,897 --> 00:32:28,195
Someone did this.

662
00:32:30,288 --> 00:32:31,432
You mean a person.

663
00:32:31,474 --> 00:32:33,275
An animal wouldn't
have left so much.

664
00:32:33,317 --> 00:32:36,156
We should have seen it before.
It's homicidal triad 101.

665
00:32:36,198 --> 00:32:37,970
We said the kills
were all over the map.

666
00:32:38,012 --> 00:32:39,998
The unsub lacks sophistication
and shows immaturity

667
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,610
in his kills because he is immature.

668
00:32:41,652 --> 00:32:44,086
He started with animals because
that's what he was taught

669
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,422
Ever since he was a child.

670
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:48,395
And when he got bored with animals,
he moved on to more challenging prey.

671
00:32:48,437 --> 00:32:50,785
- People.
- Your unsub's a teenage boy.

672
00:32:55,332 --> 00:32:57,100
The boy we were
talking about before,

673
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:59,454
he wouldn't be a former student,
he'd be a current student,

674
00:32:59,496 --> 00:33:01,281
a teenager who loves to hunt.

675
00:33:01,323 --> 00:33:04,425
I only have two teenagers right now.
Both of them are girls.

676
00:33:09,956 --> 00:33:11,107
Go ahead, Garcia.

677
00:33:11,149 --> 00:33:13,040
I found something uber weird.

678
00:33:13,082 --> 00:33:15,243
In Joshua's college
application essay,

679
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:18,121
he talks about the impact that being
an older brother had on his life.

680
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:19,813
I thought he didn't
have any siblings.

681
00:33:19,855 --> 00:33:22,828
He doesn't, and yet he's talking
about how hard it was

682
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:25,015
to leave him behind
when he moved to Anchorage,

683
00:33:25,057 --> 00:33:26,607
to leave him unprotected.

684
00:33:26,649 --> 00:33:27,785
Thanks.

685
00:33:33,004 --> 00:33:35,346
Was there a student
that Joshua may have taken

686
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:37,274
under his wing before he moved away?

687
00:33:38,042 --> 00:33:40,675
Someone you may have
suspected was being abused?

688
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:44,855
Oh, my God.

689
00:33:45,302 --> 00:33:46,315
What?

690
00:33:46,521 --> 00:33:47,525
Owen Porter.

691
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:50,271
He's not a student anymore.
He's home-schooled.

692
00:33:50,313 --> 00:33:52,989
Joshua and he were attached at
the hip when they were younger.

693
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:56,023
I've been called out
to the Porter house several times.

694
00:33:56,148 --> 00:33:57,493
Domestic disturbance.

695
00:33:57,577 --> 00:34:00,413
Owen and his mom always
covering for the dad.

696
00:34:01,315 --> 00:34:02,331
Let's go.

697
00:34:03,008 --> 00:34:04,073
Thanks.

698
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,794
Talk about abandonment issues.

699
00:34:07,647 --> 00:34:10,969
Owen was left victim
to the abusive hand of his father.

700
00:34:11,126 --> 00:34:13,926
Joshua's return probably derailed
Owen's mental stability.

701
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,846
Add to that the accidental shooting
of Jon Baker and he snapped.

702
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:19,380
He got off on that first killing.
He had to do it again.

703
00:34:19,422 --> 00:34:21,417
So he targeted people
trying to leave town.

704
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:23,333
In his mind, when people
leave, he gets hurt.

705
00:34:23,375 --> 00:34:25,479
And he resented Carol
for taking Joshua away,

706
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,735
So he killed her to make sure
he never left again.

707
00:34:27,777 --> 00:34:29,707
- Where would he go now?
- We're surrounded

708
00:34:29,749 --> 00:34:31,934
by waterways and mountains.
He could be anywhere.

709
00:34:33,581 --> 00:34:36,157
- Mr. Porter, is your son at home?
- What's it to you?

710
00:34:36,947 --> 00:34:38,239
Turn that off.

711
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,958
- Did you know?
- Don't know what you're talking about!

712
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,167
Not for sure.
Not until last night.

713
00:34:46,512 --> 00:34:49,812
- He came home covered in blood.
- He's not here. But the window's open.

714
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:52,393
It's not the first time you've washed
blood out of his clothes, is it?

715
00:34:52,435 --> 00:34:54,773
- Don't answer them, Martha!
- Sit down and shut up.

716
00:34:54,815 --> 00:34:57,219
I promise he will not
lay a hand on you again.

717
00:35:00,813 --> 00:35:01,849
No.

718
00:35:02,701 --> 00:35:04,268
It wasn't the first time.

719
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,823
Mrs. Porter, I understand you're
only trying to protect Owen,

720
00:35:06,865 --> 00:35:08,253
but you can't anymore.

721
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,360
He's always been different.

722
00:35:10,402 --> 00:35:11,984
He's not like us.

723
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:15,154
When he was a little boy,
he used to go out into the woods

724
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:18,686
- and come home covered in blood.
- Why didn't you tell anyone, Martha?

725
00:35:18,874 --> 00:35:21,181
How could you just sit there
and do nothing while people died?

726
00:35:21,223 --> 00:35:23,461
How did Owen react
when Joshua was sent away?

727
00:35:23,503 --> 00:35:25,341
He wanted to leave, too.

728
00:35:26,686 --> 00:35:28,083
But I couldn't let him.

729
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:31,997
Mrs. Porter, do you have any idea
what social isolation does to a child?

730
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:36,538
I was afraid of what
he might do if he ever left here.

731
00:35:37,933 --> 00:35:39,108
We knew.

732
00:35:40,164 --> 00:35:41,611
We knew what he was.

733
00:35:42,756 --> 00:35:44,850
- We've got a problem.
- What is it?

734
00:35:45,197 --> 00:35:47,267
Joshua managed
to shake deputy stiller.

735
00:35:47,309 --> 00:35:49,783
And someone reported a hunting
party going into the woods.

736
00:35:49,825 --> 00:35:50,913
Oh, God.

737
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:54,296
They're hunting Owen.

738
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:33,193
Listen.

739
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:35,006
That way. Go.

740
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:47,453
You have him?

741
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,451
No.
He's moving too fast.

742
00:36:49,493 --> 00:36:51,368
Looks like he's circling
back towards town.

743
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:52,780
Maybe we'll get lucky.

744
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,849
- Did they just shoot him?
- They would be shooting

745
00:36:55,891 --> 00:36:57,962
- if they weren't close.
- Let's go.

746
00:37:01,899 --> 00:37:04,680
- Do you know where he's headed?
- Was there a place he went to be alone?

747
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,446
A hiding spot when
you were mad at him?

748
00:37:06,488 --> 00:37:08,508
Hiding spot. How the hell
are we supposed to know?

749
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:10,217
If you know, you need to tell me.

750
00:37:10,259 --> 00:37:12,198
I'm trying to help him.
There's a mob out there,

751
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,035
and if they find him,
they're not gonna turn him over.

752
00:37:14,077 --> 00:37:16,028
They're gonna take justice
into their own hands.

753
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:18,379
If you value your son's life,
you need to help me.

754
00:37:18,421 --> 00:37:19,509
Martha, don't!

755
00:37:24,721 --> 00:37:25,826
Lake Lafayette.

756
00:37:27,085 --> 00:37:29,496
He and Joshua built a fort
there when they were younger.

757
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:31,758
You'll need a boat upriver
to get there.

758
00:37:35,589 --> 00:37:36,879
Hold on, guys.

759
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:41,648
Yeah, Hotch, what's up?

760
00:37:42,676 --> 00:37:43,773
Ok. I got it.

761
00:37:44,427 --> 00:37:45,745
There's a new plan.

762
00:37:56,136 --> 00:37:57,722
He's heading for the harbor.

763
00:38:05,065 --> 00:38:06,601
Owen, put the gun down.

764
00:38:06,743 --> 00:38:08,188
Drop it, son.

765
00:38:08,561 --> 00:38:10,955
Who do you want to take
your chances with, us or them?

766
00:38:11,591 --> 00:38:14,375
- Drop the weapons and back away!
- Can't do that, agents.

767
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:16,545
- The boy's coming with us.
- It's not happening!

768
00:38:16,587 --> 00:38:18,578
Back down, Keith.
We're in control now.

769
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,407
What are you gonna do, Steve?
He's 16.

770
00:38:20,449 --> 00:38:22,775
Send him back to juvey
so he's out in 2 years?

771
00:38:22,817 --> 00:38:24,534
- He killed my mom.
- He killed Brenda.

772
00:38:24,576 --> 00:38:27,424
He needs help and he will
be held accountable for his crimes.

773
00:38:27,466 --> 00:38:29,390
Accountable?
5 people are dead.

774
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:31,684
Why'd you do it, Owen?
Huh? Why'd you kill her?

775
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:34,074
- You left me behind.
- You killed my mom!

776
00:38:34,116 --> 00:38:36,939
She sent you away!
You left and you didn't come back.

777
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:39,066
8 years and I never
heard from you again.

778
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,853
Please, just let us take him in.

779
00:38:40,895 --> 00:38:44,139
Sorry. I can't. I know what you're
saying is right, but I can't do it.

780
00:38:44,181 --> 00:38:46,149
I'm terribly sorry for your loss,

781
00:38:46,191 --> 00:38:48,937
but please just put your guns
down so no one else gets hurt.

782
00:38:48,979 --> 00:38:51,299
Are you kidding?
You're outnumbered and outgunned.

783
00:38:51,341 --> 00:38:53,247
Who do you think
has the higher ground here?

784
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,961
I'm pretty sure we do!

785
00:39:03,832 --> 00:39:04,925
I don't know.

786
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,603
What are you-- what are you doing?

787
00:39:06,645 --> 00:39:08,971
- We can still take him!
- It's over, Joshua.

788
00:39:09,576 --> 00:39:11,265
- He killed my mom.
- I know,

789
00:39:11,523 --> 00:39:12,855
and I'm sorry.

790
00:39:16,408 --> 00:39:17,514
You shot him?

791
00:39:18,976 --> 00:39:19,989
He'll live.

792
00:39:46,154 --> 00:39:50,637
<i>I made a lover's pledge</i>

793
00:39:55,832 --> 00:40:00,759
<i>I made a lover's pledge</i>

794
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:10,783
<i>then watched the sky</i>

795
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:21,809
<i>and wanted to cry and...</i>

796
00:40:25,721 --> 00:40:29,134
<i>and you and I</i>

797
00:40:30,173 --> 00:40:31,651
It sucks, doesn't it?

798
00:40:32,473 --> 00:40:33,594
What?

799
00:40:34,546 --> 00:40:37,733
Just knowing that we couldn't have
done any of this without you.

800
00:40:38,404 --> 00:40:40,046
Yeah, pretty much.

801
00:40:46,805 --> 00:40:48,814
I'm proud of you, Penelope.

802
00:40:51,023 --> 00:40:53,757
Despite everything that happened,
you came back...

803
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:55,956
And you got the job done.

804
00:40:57,665 --> 00:41:00,205
The sight of blood
used to make me run away.

805
00:41:01,463 --> 00:41:03,544
And two nights ago I ran towards it.

806
00:41:08,505 --> 00:41:11,260
It means you're changing into
someone stronger than you realize.

807
00:41:12,189 --> 00:41:15,264
You cared enough to risk your own life
to try and save someone else.

808
00:41:16,001 --> 00:41:17,254
Yeah, but...

809
00:41:17,644 --> 00:41:22,245
What's the difference between
being strong and being jaded?

810
00:41:23,395 --> 00:41:24,733
I'm scared, Derek.

811
00:41:24,775 --> 00:41:28,403
I don't want to lose who I am
just so I can do this job.

812
00:41:33,555 --> 00:41:36,499
We are in one of the most
beautiful places on earth.

813
00:41:37,659 --> 00:41:39,418
I know you see that, don't you?

814
00:41:39,817 --> 00:41:40,832
Yeah.

815
00:41:44,733 --> 00:41:46,891
Then we have nothing to worry about.

816
00:41:48,296 --> 00:41:50,500
It's who you are, baby girl.

817
00:41:51,089 --> 00:41:54,361
You see the beauty in everything
and everyone no matter where you go.

818
00:41:55,341 --> 00:41:58,248
That part of you is never gonna
change, and I won't let it.

819
00:41:58,586 --> 00:42:00,100
I don't need you to protect me.

820
00:42:00,275 --> 00:42:01,440
Tough.

821
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:04,162
I think I'm gonna stay on
the job a little while longer.

822
00:42:04,204 --> 00:42:05,814
Yeah?
How much longer?

823
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:08,246
Every day of my life.

824
00:42:11,513 --> 00:42:14,101
I kind of love you, Derek Morgan.

825
00:42:16,353 --> 00:42:18,821
I kinda love you, Penelope Garcia.

826
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:25,569
<i>just a little...</i>

827
00:42:25,611 --> 00:42:27,370
<i>Ralph W. Sockman said,</i>

828
00:42:27,412 --> 00:42:29,692
<i>"Nothing is so strong as gentleness,</i>

829
00:42:29,734 --> 00:42:32,475
<i>and nothing is so gentle
as real strength."</i>
