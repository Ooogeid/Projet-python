1
00:00:52,902 --> 00:00:53,943
Lorraine.

2
00:00:54,068 --> 00:00:56,430
- There you are.
- I'm sorry that I'm late.

3
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,228
I was about to call you.

4
00:00:58,353 --> 00:01:01,052
I should know better than
to keep a beautiful woman waiting.

5
00:01:01,177 --> 00:01:03,058
Oh, laying it on thick, aren't you?

6
00:01:03,183 --> 00:01:05,286
I've been looking
forward to this.

7
00:01:05,889 --> 00:01:08,609
- Got a prospectus for you.
- Food first.

8
00:01:09,085 --> 00:01:10,636
Do you like crab louie?

9
00:01:10,761 --> 00:01:12,679
- I do.
- It is so good here.

10
00:01:12,804 --> 00:01:14,780
They use stone crab fresh
from the bay.

11
00:01:14,905 --> 00:01:17,243
The filet is wonderful
if you're in the mood for meat,

12
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:18,911
or the Osso Bucco.

13
00:01:26,076 --> 00:01:27,139
Henry.

14
00:01:29,576 --> 00:01:30,608
Hello.

15
00:01:33,777 --> 00:01:36,637
Sorry.
Um...my head is still at work,

16
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,974
making sure I deposited
a check for a client.

17
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,762
Well, I'm a client, too.

18
00:01:40,988 --> 00:01:42,982
And you're on my time now.

19
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,188
- You have my full attention.
- I better.

20
00:01:46,779 --> 00:01:48,980
I have something you want.

21
00:01:52,185 --> 00:01:53,619
This is all you have on him?

22
00:01:53,744 --> 00:01:56,031
We have the back of his head
from a few CCTV angles,

23
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,520
nothing that helps.

24
00:01:57,645 --> 00:01:59,618
He's careful to avoid
being seen on camera.

25
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:03,581
Out of all my cases, this guy was
never flagged as top priority, but...

26
00:02:03,952 --> 00:02:05,598
this murder changes everything.

27
00:02:05,723 --> 00:02:08,574
You were right to call us.
We'll explain why.

28
00:02:11,707 --> 00:02:13,563
Everyone,
this is agent Russell Goldman

29
00:02:13,688 --> 00:02:16,958
from the San Diego White Collar Team.
You've already met agent Hotchner.

30
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,597
These are agents Rossi,
Morgan, Prentiss, and Reid.

31
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:20,606
A pleasure.

32
00:02:20,731 --> 00:02:23,507
- So we're working a white collar case?
- Not exactly.

33
00:02:23,632 --> 00:02:26,065
I've been following
a con artist for 5 years.

34
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,523
Two nights ago,
I think he killed someone.

35
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:31,200
Carla Marshall of Miami was
found dead in her home.

36
00:02:31,325 --> 00:02:34,671
Asphyxiation by strangulation.
She also had trauma wounds to the head.

37
00:02:34,796 --> 00:02:36,450
Why do we think
the con man killed her?

38
00:02:36,575 --> 00:02:39,351
Last week Carla contacted
a fraud website to report a scam.

39
00:02:39,476 --> 00:02:41,373
The complaint ended up
on Goldman's desk.

40
00:02:41,498 --> 00:02:43,251
We spoke on the phone at length.

41
00:02:43,376 --> 00:02:45,302
Her story matched my guy to the "T."

42
00:02:45,427 --> 00:02:47,523
She planned on confronting
him that night.

43
00:02:47,648 --> 00:02:49,460
I told her to cease
all communications

44
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:53,598
and wait for me, I'd fly
to Miami and set up a sting.

45
00:02:53,723 --> 00:02:55,508
But that never happened.

46
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:58,825
Do you have physical evidence
confirming it's your guy?

47
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,914
No, but for her to be murdered
the night that we spoke,

48
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:03,766
I don't think it was a coincidence.

49
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:06,894
There was no sign of forced entry,
theft, or sexual assault.

50
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:09,480
And judging from the M.O.,
the motive was personal.

51
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:11,482
- What's his hustle?
- Investment fraud.

52
00:03:11,607 --> 00:03:13,192
Basically, he's a smaller madoff.

53
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:16,170
To give you an idea
of how convincing he is,

54
00:03:16,295 --> 00:03:18,864
this is a sampling
of his work going back 14 years.

55
00:03:19,148 --> 00:03:20,307
He's prolific.

56
00:03:20,432 --> 00:03:23,382
He's scammed hundreds
of thousands of dollars from people,

57
00:03:23,507 --> 00:03:25,157
but he's never been violent before.

58
00:03:25,282 --> 00:03:27,414
Con men usually don't murder,
but when they do,

59
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,065
it's to conceal their crimes.

60
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,461
- Con man's a nice name for these guys.
- They profile as psychopaths.

61
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,880
They see their cons as theater
and themselves as a sort

62
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,924
of puppeteer.
They have to have absolute

63
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:38,868
control over their victims and their cons.

64
00:03:38,993 --> 00:03:41,544
Maybe that's why he starting killing,
because he lost control?

65
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:43,430
The question is,
how out of control is he?

66
00:03:43,555 --> 00:03:45,896
If he's spiraling, he's a danger
to everyone around him.

67
00:03:46,021 --> 00:03:49,019
And because he's so charming,
the victims never see it coming.

68
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:50,936
Who do I make it out to?

69
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:52,940
Grant Dale Investments, Inc.

70
00:03:53,528 --> 00:03:55,702
Hunter Portland advisors,
incorporated.

71
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,363
Henry Moffet Hedge funds,
incorporated.

72
00:03:59,488 --> 00:04:00,596
Henry Moffet...

73
00:04:01,723 --> 00:04:02,887
Hedge funds...

74
00:04:03,486 --> 00:04:04,257
Inc.

75
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,624
This is a lot of money.

76
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,958
It'll be the best decision
of your life.

77
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:53,487
Criminal Team
http://experts.heberg-forum.net/

78
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,364
"If I am what I have,

79
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,507
"and if I lose what I have,

80
00:05:03,717 --> 00:05:05,205
who, then, am I?"

81
00:05:05,457 --> 00:05:07,932
German psychologist Erich Fromm.

82
00:05:10,194 --> 00:05:12,561
I can't believe
you guys have your own jet.

83
00:05:13,691 --> 00:05:16,215
We take turns piloting.
You want to give her a try?

84
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,453
Really?

85
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,130
No.

86
00:05:20,703 --> 00:05:23,530
What kind of forensic countermeasures
does he use to hide his trail?

87
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:27,710
Fake I.D.S, disposable phones, prepaid
credit cards, foreign bank accounts.

88
00:05:27,835 --> 00:05:29,703
You can't track
his accounts overseas?

89
00:05:29,828 --> 00:05:31,719
We can, but it takes months
to get the records,

90
00:05:31,844 --> 00:05:34,350
and it only takes him seconds
to transfer money again and again.

91
00:05:34,475 --> 00:05:36,936
By the time you figure out it's
in the Bahamas, he's already moved

92
00:05:37,061 --> 00:05:40,343
- it to Switzerland or somewhere else.
- I've always been too far behind him.

93
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,752
Well, we're a lot closer
now because of Carla.

94
00:05:42,877 --> 00:05:44,842
What made her suspicious
in the first place?

95
00:05:44,967 --> 00:05:47,266
She needed to get her father
into a retirement home,

96
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:50,106
and when she called this guy
Grant Dale to free up her money,

97
00:05:50,231 --> 00:05:51,931
he never returned her phone calls.

98
00:05:52,056 --> 00:05:54,417
A con man's first instinct
is flight, not fight.

99
00:05:54,542 --> 00:05:57,510
What makes him kill, though,
isn't financial, it's psychological.

100
00:05:57,635 --> 00:06:00,895
That's what we need to concentrate on.
Why Carla and why now?

101
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,630
Morgan and Prentiss,
go to her house.

102
00:06:02,755 --> 00:06:04,420
Agent Goldman,
why don't you join them.

103
00:06:04,545 --> 00:06:06,345
I sent his case files
to the field office.

104
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,656
Shouldn't I stay with you
and help you sift through them?

105
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,286
I'd like to go through
them independently, come up

106
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,729
with our own theories,
see if any behavioral patterns

107
00:06:13,854 --> 00:06:15,786
emerge that'll help us
get ahead of him.

108
00:06:17,212 --> 00:06:19,486
Agent Goldman's files are
in that room down the hall.

109
00:06:19,611 --> 00:06:20,431
Thank you.

110
00:06:20,556 --> 00:06:22,665
- Let me know if you need anything.
- Thank you.

111
00:06:30,562 --> 00:06:31,998
You're kidding me.

112
00:06:32,852 --> 00:06:34,464
We have to go through all of this?

113
00:06:34,589 --> 00:06:36,826
White Collar cases often
come down to a paper trail.

114
00:06:36,951 --> 00:06:39,290
Maybe it won't be so bad.
I mean, at least it's well organized.

115
00:06:39,415 --> 00:06:40,430
That's his job.

116
00:06:40,555 --> 00:06:43,412
He sits at a desk all day
and accumulates paper evidence.

117
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:46,427
OK. Dave, you work victimology.
Reid, see if you can find anything

118
00:06:46,552 --> 00:06:49,264
in his travel patterns. JJ, let's get
a timeline up on the board.

119
00:07:01,961 --> 00:07:04,057
She was a real estate agent.

120
00:07:04,462 --> 00:07:06,120
She was doing well for herself

121
00:07:06,245 --> 00:07:08,241
until William came into her life.

122
00:07:09,621 --> 00:07:11,929
Why do you call him that?

123
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:15,350
He introduced himself as Bill, Billy,

124
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:18,035
or Will several times in his early cons.

125
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:21,532
My guess is that his real name
may be some form of William.

126
00:07:21,748 --> 00:07:23,960
So most of his victims
were very wealthy, right?

127
00:07:24,085 --> 00:07:25,861
You should see some
of their mansions.

128
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,707
Well, I'm looking around this house
and it's nice, but no mansion.

129
00:07:28,832 --> 00:07:31,597
She didn't invest as much
as his other clients either.

130
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,760
I wonder why he targeted her.

131
00:07:33,885 --> 00:07:36,734
She may have been useful
to him in some other way.

132
00:07:37,355 --> 00:07:40,420
Hey, Goldman. What was the alias
he was using with Carla?

133
00:07:40,545 --> 00:07:42,783
- Grant Dale.
- Come check this out.

134
00:07:45,504 --> 00:07:46,715
He set up a website.

135
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,872
Why didn't the detectives
find this before?

136
00:07:48,997 --> 00:07:51,248
The locals wouldn't know
to look for it.

137
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:54,932
Well, it's only one page.
Generic investment information.

138
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:57,559
I mean, there's no contacts,
there's no picture of himself.

139
00:07:57,684 --> 00:07:59,745
No, just photos
of nice cars and houses.

140
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,661
So he's selling the fantasy
of success.

141
00:08:02,992 --> 00:08:04,517
His web design is pretty basic.

142
00:08:04,642 --> 00:08:07,319
I mean, it's like a standard template.
It would be fairly easy to set up.

143
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,004
Maybe he created others.

144
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:10,489
I'm gonna call Garcia.

145
00:08:13,777 --> 00:08:15,722
Hey, baby girl, it's me.
You're on speaker.

146
00:08:15,847 --> 00:08:18,497
Sug, I don't care who hears it.
It's always been you.

147
00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:21,206
Listen, I just emailed you a link.

148
00:08:23,768 --> 00:08:24,713
Got it.

149
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,358
- It's the unsub's website.
- Do you want me to find out how he paid

150
00:08:27,483 --> 00:08:29,451
for his hosting services,
track him down that way?

151
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:31,426
We'll run into the same
backstopping trail.

152
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:34,273
- You are right. That's untraceable.
- All right, we'll forget that.

153
00:08:34,398 --> 00:08:37,079
Can you do a search for websites
containing the same content?

154
00:08:37,931 --> 00:08:40,602
And searching... and searching...

155
00:08:43,753 --> 00:08:47,651
there are 1, 2... 9 identical
websites, same written content,

156
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,736
same pictures,
just different names.

157
00:08:50,132 --> 00:08:51,941
These are all new aliases.

158
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,897
And he's never had 10 at once.

159
00:08:54,022 --> 00:08:55,284
This is all new.

160
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:57,883
I'm Henry Moffet.

161
00:08:58,008 --> 00:09:00,372
You lied to me about everything.

162
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,093
- What are you talking about?
- Your name is not Grant Dale.

163
00:09:04,852 --> 00:09:06,505
God, why are you doing this to me?

164
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,776
- Just calm down. Listen to me.
- No, just leave.

165
00:09:08,901 --> 00:09:11,864
- You're not giving me a chance to explain.
- Leave or I'll call the police!

166
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:18,932
Grant...

167
00:09:20,706 --> 00:09:21,748
Grant...

168
00:09:21,952 --> 00:09:22,969
Grant...

169
00:09:24,428 --> 00:09:25,690
I'm Henry Moffet.

170
00:09:27,468 --> 00:09:29,095
Henry Moffet.

171
00:09:33,129 --> 00:09:37,195
The CIA assigns an agent
2 or 3 aliases at most.

172
00:09:38,065 --> 00:09:41,355
Any more than that,and it's difficult
to keep the names straight.

173
00:09:41,588 --> 00:09:43,040
This guy's juggling 10.

174
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:46,169
Being all these people, that's gotta
start fracturing him somehow.

175
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,819
If his memory is strained,
it could be causing him to lose control.

176
00:09:48,944 --> 00:09:51,632
We have the current aliases. We just
need to know who the clients are.

177
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,826
Got Carla's phone records.
She made several calls

178
00:09:53,951 --> 00:09:56,434
to an unknown number the night
she died. I tracked the number.

179
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:58,908
It was a disposable phone
that hasn't been used since.

180
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:01,821
That's gotta be the unsub's number.
He tossed it after he killed her.

181
00:10:01,946 --> 00:10:03,352
Over the past few months,

182
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,063
she routinely called this number
really late at night.

183
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,216
- How late?
- Like bedtime late.

184
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:11,219
You don't do business with your
investment manager at bedtime.

185
00:10:25,304 --> 00:10:27,271
So, when are we gonna do this again?

186
00:10:30,007 --> 00:10:32,457
My husband's coming home, so...

187
00:10:33,493 --> 00:10:35,329
I won't see you for a while.

188
00:10:36,477 --> 00:10:38,762
I'll miss you...
you lied to me Grant.

189
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,431
About everything.
Leave or I'll call the police!

190
00:10:44,682 --> 00:10:46,277
Grant, are you ok?

191
00:10:48,144 --> 00:10:49,606
Henry, are you ok?

192
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,279
I'm gonna miss you, too.

193
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,844
So Carla never mentioned anything
about an affair with him?

194
00:11:04,969 --> 00:11:08,347
No, but it's always been a challenge with
fraud victims to be totally forthcoming.

195
00:11:08,472 --> 00:11:11,405
They're so embarrassed about being
duped, they don't tell you everything.

196
00:11:11,683 --> 00:11:12,971
Detective Goldman.

197
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:16,205
We'd like to compare notes.
Shoot.

198
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:18,774
I'm looking at the victimology.

199
00:11:18,955 --> 00:11:20,816
We say affinity groups.
Same thing.

200
00:11:20,941 --> 00:11:23,239
It refers to victims
with shared interests.

201
00:11:23,364 --> 00:11:26,301
Ok. We're in your world,
we'll use your terms.

202
00:11:26,838 --> 00:11:30,001
Your files point to specific
affinity groups he targeted

203
00:11:30,126 --> 00:11:32,254
in the first few cities.

204
00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:34,538
- Does this look accurate to you?
- Yes, it does.

205
00:11:34,663 --> 00:11:36,457
Once he got beyond San Diego,

206
00:11:36,582 --> 00:11:39,541
his victims are all over the place.
No shared interests.

207
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,208
I came to the same conclusions.

208
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:44,578
So he stopped using affinity groups
and found his victims somewhere else.

209
00:11:44,824 --> 00:11:46,908
Where, I don't know.

210
00:11:47,078 --> 00:11:48,481
That's where we start.

211
00:11:59,448 --> 00:12:00,834
I'm Randy Summerland.

212
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:02,929
I'm Randy Summerland.

213
00:12:10,568 --> 00:12:12,001
Make us some money, ok?

214
00:12:12,568 --> 00:12:13,592
I can do that.

215
00:12:13,646 --> 00:12:15,289
Now, how do I spell
your name, again?

216
00:12:15,353 --> 00:12:16,697
M-o-f-f-e-t.

217
00:12:16,867 --> 00:12:18,866
Henry Moffet Hedge funds,
incorporated.

218
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:20,695
Who is Henry Moffet?

219
00:12:24,632 --> 00:12:25,973
who is Henry Moffet?

220
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:29,208
It's my partner.

221
00:12:30,569 --> 00:12:32,635
You didn't mention anything
about a partner.

222
00:12:32,805 --> 00:12:33,687
I didn't?

223
00:12:34,206 --> 00:12:36,954
And this isn't who I made
the check out to last time.

224
00:12:37,136 --> 00:12:38,808
He's been my partner for years.

225
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:41,132
Then why am I making
the check out to him?

226
00:12:42,364 --> 00:12:44,002
There's a simple explanation.

227
00:13:04,024 --> 00:13:07,323
So, the unsub
and the vic are having drinks.

228
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:11,890
The vic has a checkbook and pen out,
check's dated, but that's it.

229
00:13:11,948 --> 00:13:14,035
The unsub got that close
to getting his money,

230
00:13:14,101 --> 00:13:15,763
somehow failed, and then did this.

231
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,269
And this is overkill.
He bashed his head in.

232
00:13:18,439 --> 00:13:21,007
He's completely unhinged
and devolving fast.

233
00:13:21,449 --> 00:13:23,071
Only he doesn't know that.

234
00:13:23,305 --> 00:13:25,946
He's still trying to go to work
and he doesn't know he's in danger

235
00:13:26,008 --> 00:13:28,679
of losing it at any minute.
Like a functioning alcoholic.

236
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,578
The unsub channels all
of his energy into these cons,

237
00:13:31,748 --> 00:13:33,486
and when the con falls apart,

238
00:13:33,826 --> 00:13:35,357
this is how he handles it.

239
00:13:35,527 --> 00:13:37,071
How long have you known Randy?

240
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:41,433
We spent a lot of time with him
in the last couple of months.

241
00:13:42,126 --> 00:13:43,701
He was helping us invest.

242
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,925
How much money did you give to him?

243
00:13:46,095 --> 00:13:49,536
He just kept saying we needed
to be aggressive in this market.

244
00:13:51,508 --> 00:13:52,949
this is all my fault.

245
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:54,351
What do you mean?

246
00:13:54,521 --> 00:13:55,942
I met randy.

247
00:13:57,229 --> 00:13:59,389
I brought this man into our lives.

248
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:00,677
Mrs. Mckelson,

249
00:14:02,126 --> 00:14:05,686
is there anything more
to your relationship with Randy?

250
00:14:10,898 --> 00:14:12,756
We're gonna find out eventually.

251
00:14:14,977 --> 00:14:16,016
Find out what?

252
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,777
Randy wasn't who he said he was.

253
00:14:19,947 --> 00:14:21,735
Randy wasn't even his real name.

254
00:14:25,355 --> 00:14:27,841
We think this man is using
his looks and his charm

255
00:14:28,599 --> 00:14:29,780
to target women.

256
00:14:30,961 --> 00:14:32,479
So there's others.

257
00:14:33,244 --> 00:14:36,000
I laid in bed next to the man
who killed my husband.

258
00:14:39,181 --> 00:14:41,370
Did they have transgressions?

259
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,007
She's pretty beat up over it.

260
00:14:58,133 --> 00:15:00,340
Randy, who is Henry Moffet?

261
00:15:14,684 --> 00:15:15,534
Daddy?

262
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:26,336
You're home!

263
00:15:27,076 --> 00:15:28,336
Good morning, buddy.

264
00:15:30,823 --> 00:15:32,244
Let me look at you.

265
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,211
You're a handsome devil,
you know that?

266
00:15:34,263 --> 00:15:35,334
I missed you.

267
00:15:35,391 --> 00:15:36,746
I missed you, too.

268
00:15:37,722 --> 00:15:39,517
When did you get in?

269
00:15:43,044 --> 00:15:44,082
Just now.

270
00:15:44,178 --> 00:15:45,570
How was your trip?

271
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:47,242
It didn't really pan out.

272
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:48,913
Sorry. What happened?

273
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,974
Can we, uh, talk about this after
J.D. goes to school?

274
00:15:53,344 --> 00:15:54,636
I want pancakes.

275
00:15:55,439 --> 00:15:57,203
Really? You do?

276
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,856
Well, then pancakes you shall have.

277
00:16:13,245 --> 00:16:15,038
You're not enjoying this, are you?

278
00:16:15,062 --> 00:16:17,301
I like a good paper trail.
I find it meditative.

279
00:16:17,397 --> 00:16:19,807
Is it really that hard for you
to be normal just one time?

280
00:16:20,067 --> 00:16:22,555
He just burned another alias.

281
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,504
You know, if this guy's on a mission
to eliminate all these aliases,

282
00:16:26,556 --> 00:16:28,971
he's gonna systematically
assassinate his victims.

283
00:16:28,998 --> 00:16:30,615
Carla lived in Miami.

284
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,373
This victim, frank Mckelson,
lived north in Ft. Lauderdale.

285
00:16:33,429 --> 00:16:35,392
The victims could be
anywhere in south Florida.

286
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,289
If he's working harder
because of the economy,

287
00:16:37,354 --> 00:16:39,458
it makes sense that he would
expand his operating zone.

288
00:16:39,473 --> 00:16:42,002
Prentiss and Rossi are on their way back.
We need to give the profile.

289
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:43,703
There's something else
about San Diego.

290
00:16:43,722 --> 00:16:45,958
I noticed in his earlier crimes
he only stays in each city

291
00:16:46,033 --> 00:16:47,716
an average of 14 to 18 months.

292
00:16:47,886 --> 00:16:49,813
Then he's in San Diego
for 3 1/2 years

293
00:16:49,983 --> 00:16:52,202
and then never in the same city
for that long again.

294
00:16:52,372 --> 00:16:55,722
All right, so what is it about
San Diego that made him stay longer?

295
00:16:56,595 --> 00:16:58,818
Keep following that, Reid.
See where it takes us.

296
00:16:59,022 --> 00:17:00,094
Are you sure?

297
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:03,036
I wouldn't be doing this
if we didn't have to.

298
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:07,542
J.D. was just starting
to make new friends.

299
00:17:07,591 --> 00:17:09,770
What do you want me to do?
The money has dried up here.

300
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,309
Maybe you could take a break,

301
00:17:11,371 --> 00:17:12,732
spend more time with J.D.

302
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,779
Ok, then how am I supposed
to raise a family

303
00:17:14,836 --> 00:17:16,395
if I don't have enough clients?

304
00:17:16,472 --> 00:17:18,307
Baby, I hate seeing
you so stressed out.

305
00:17:18,477 --> 00:17:20,492
All right, now,
this economy is killing me.

306
00:17:20,662 --> 00:17:21,983
I can get a job, too.

307
00:17:22,153 --> 00:17:24,538
No. No, I can take care
of us myself.

308
00:17:24,591 --> 00:17:27,257
Well, we have to figure something out,
because I don't want to move again.

309
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,750
Listen, we are moving to boston.

310
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:30,123
End of discussion.

311
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,299
Honey, what happened?

312
00:17:33,612 --> 00:17:35,057
Now start packing.

313
00:17:38,601 --> 00:17:40,370
This unsub
is a white collar con man

314
00:17:40,414 --> 00:17:43,178
who embodies what behaviorists
call the dark triad...

315
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,469
narcissism,

316
00:17:44,567 --> 00:17:45,750
machiavellianism,

317
00:17:45,829 --> 00:17:47,603
and aberrant self-promotion.

318
00:17:48,379 --> 00:17:51,106
What that means is that everything
revolves around this guy.

319
00:17:51,188 --> 00:17:53,752
He manipulates and exploits
others using dishonest tactics,

320
00:17:53,922 --> 00:17:55,736
and he's become
a menace to society.

321
00:18:07,316 --> 00:18:08,886
I'm hunter Portland.

322
00:18:12,212 --> 00:18:14,632
He's also what we call
a casanova con man.

323
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,936
He seduces women
to get to their money.

324
00:18:17,634 --> 00:18:20,799
It's standard behavior for him to
have casual sex with multiple partners

325
00:18:20,969 --> 00:18:23,894
and then use that as a weapon
to accomplish his goals.

326
00:18:28,096 --> 00:18:29,326
We have his sketch.

327
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,310
And here on the board
are his aliases.

328
00:18:31,341 --> 00:18:33,035
He frequents high-end venues...

329
00:18:33,205 --> 00:18:36,623
country clubs, hotel bars,
and membership-only establishments.

330
00:18:37,026 --> 00:18:38,448
And notify the banks.

331
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,262
He's constantly moving money,

332
00:18:40,432 --> 00:18:42,257
opening and closing bank accounts.

333
00:18:42,344 --> 00:18:44,138
He's active in
Miami and Ft. Lauderdale,

334
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,620
but he could be in other
wealthy communities, too.

335
00:18:46,701 --> 00:18:49,585
Look at places like boca raton
or coral gables.

336
00:18:49,755 --> 00:18:51,804
He has too many aliases
in his head right now

337
00:18:51,974 --> 00:18:54,559
and it's causing him
to fracture mentally.

338
00:18:54,568 --> 00:18:55,920
And it's this loss of control

339
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:58,409
that triggers his violence and
makes him dangerous to be around.

340
00:18:58,446 --> 00:19:01,523
And any additional stress will
make him more likely to attack.

341
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:04,384
I don't have to go this
long without seeing you.

342
00:19:04,972 --> 00:19:06,675
I could fly to wherever you are.

343
00:19:08,127 --> 00:19:09,620
You would just distract me.

344
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:12,325
We'd just be spending
all day in bed together.

345
00:19:12,577 --> 00:19:15,692
My husband's gone for a week.
Why don't you stay tonight?

346
00:19:18,604 --> 00:19:20,066
I... I can't, gorgeous.

347
00:19:20,102 --> 00:19:24,164
I got to deposit your check in
the bank before the market closes.

348
00:19:28,892 --> 00:19:31,477
Do you think that
we could be happy together?

349
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:35,948
I could leave my husband.

350
00:19:38,156 --> 00:19:39,264
Slow down.

351
00:19:42,883 --> 00:19:45,223
Hunter.
Hunter, not now.

352
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:47,308
I gotta...
I gotta take this.

353
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:54,876
Don't be mad at me,
but I want my check back.

354
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:00,600
I got another call.
Don't go anywhere.

355
00:20:02,807 --> 00:20:04,219
Yes, I'm here.

356
00:20:04,389 --> 00:20:06,179
I need you to pick up J.D.
from TOD's

357
00:20:06,349 --> 00:20:07,908
and drop him off at piano.

358
00:20:08,078 --> 00:20:09,096
No, I can't.

359
00:20:10,406 --> 00:20:12,552
My car broke down.
Help me out here.

360
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:14,125
Fine.

361
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:20,998
Henry, I'm really sorry, I just...

362
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,437
I don't want to move forward.

363
00:20:24,785 --> 00:20:26,699
Look, I can guarantee your money.

364
00:20:26,871 --> 00:20:28,113
Why, what do you mean?

365
00:20:28,283 --> 00:20:30,239
Well, I don't do this
for just anybody,

366
00:20:30,995 --> 00:20:34,073
but since it's you, I can,
protect you from any risk.

367
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,451
I'll pick you up in a little bit
and we'll talk about it, ok?

368
00:20:37,535 --> 00:20:39,016
Ok, Henry.

369
00:20:43,915 --> 00:20:45,467
I need you to listen to me.

370
00:20:48,591 --> 00:20:49,789
I'm pregnant.

371
00:20:54,064 --> 00:20:55,092
It's yours.

372
00:20:55,757 --> 00:20:56,917
Grant Dale.

373
00:21:01,146 --> 00:21:03,014
Agent Jareau said
you have something.

374
00:21:03,072 --> 00:21:05,402
I spoke to his victims. Before
San Diego, they described him

375
00:21:05,572 --> 00:21:09,153
as driving exotic sports cars. After
San Diego, they described him as driving

376
00:21:09,323 --> 00:21:11,560
larger sedans and SUVS.
Before San Diego,

377
00:21:11,612 --> 00:21:14,113
he lived in condos,
referred to them as bachelor pads.

378
00:21:14,181 --> 00:21:16,408
After San Diego, spoke of living
in gated communities

379
00:21:16,578 --> 00:21:17,737
with large yards.

380
00:21:17,907 --> 00:21:20,499
What forces a man to stay
put in one place for a while,

381
00:21:20,669 --> 00:21:23,158
downgrade his car,
upgrade his house?

382
00:21:23,216 --> 00:21:24,784
You think he has a family?

383
00:21:24,832 --> 00:21:27,724
These are lifestyle changes
a new dad would make.

384
00:21:27,959 --> 00:21:29,459
Why would he start a family?

385
00:21:29,527 --> 00:21:31,197
Because he wants
to appear normal,

386
00:21:31,234 --> 00:21:33,093
and a family does that
for a psychopath.

387
00:21:33,156 --> 00:21:34,708
Wives usually serve a purpose,

388
00:21:35,242 --> 00:21:37,572
as a caretaker or homemaker.

389
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:39,728
They value their offspring as
an extension of themselves

390
00:21:39,807 --> 00:21:41,996
and it also feeds
their narcissistic ego.

391
00:21:42,025 --> 00:21:44,366
These are interesting theories,
but how does this help us?

392
00:21:44,404 --> 00:21:45,774
As a forensic countermeasure,

393
00:21:45,834 --> 00:21:48,083
con men put everything
in their wives' names.

394
00:21:48,148 --> 00:21:49,904
Bank accounts, cars, homes.

395
00:21:49,979 --> 00:21:51,932
And if his wife isn't
complicit in his crimes,

396
00:21:51,993 --> 00:21:53,667
she'll still be using her real name.

397
00:21:53,837 --> 00:21:55,369
If we find the wife,

398
00:21:55,671 --> 00:21:57,012
we can find the unsub.

399
00:22:03,493 --> 00:22:06,964
Thank you, for the drink
and for guaranteeing my money.

400
00:22:07,847 --> 00:22:09,438
It's all gonna work out.

401
00:22:09,671 --> 00:22:10,769
I just got scared.

402
00:22:11,485 --> 00:22:12,672
I understand.

403
00:22:19,709 --> 00:22:21,331
You pressed the wrong button.

404
00:22:24,153 --> 00:22:24,929
Dad?

405
00:22:27,067 --> 00:22:27,863
Daddy?

406
00:22:29,395 --> 00:22:30,473
Hey, that's me.

407
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,359
Can I talk to you about something?

408
00:22:34,183 --> 00:22:35,559
Yeah, of course, buddy.

409
00:22:36,048 --> 00:22:37,430
Do we have to move again?

410
00:22:37,882 --> 00:22:38,880
I like it here.

411
00:22:42,966 --> 00:22:44,966
You know, I'm really
disappointed in you.

412
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:46,525
Sorry.

413
00:22:50,367 --> 00:22:53,880
I'm really disappointed because
you didn't say something sooner.

414
00:22:54,225 --> 00:22:57,362
You know, if you want something in life
as a man, you need to ask for it.

415
00:22:57,532 --> 00:22:58,985
Now, let that be a lesson.

416
00:23:01,749 --> 00:23:03,512
So you really like
it here, huh, big guy?

417
00:23:05,263 --> 00:23:07,758
Well, I think I may have found a way
for us to stay for a while.

418
00:23:08,945 --> 00:23:09,953
Serious?

419
00:23:12,252 --> 00:23:15,099
I just need to dump
my client list and start over.

420
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:16,850
So we can stay?

421
00:23:18,047 --> 00:23:19,747
I'd do anything for you, kiddo.

422
00:23:25,842 --> 00:23:27,146
What is that?

423
00:23:37,873 --> 00:23:39,924
Just hang out here
for a sec, all right?

424
00:23:40,094 --> 00:23:41,327
Watch your video.

425
00:23:51,226 --> 00:23:52,537
What is it?

426
00:23:52,707 --> 00:23:54,106
Spare tire came loose.

427
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,321
Don't worry.

428
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,322
I'm fixing it.

429
00:24:32,016 --> 00:24:33,792
Massive blunt force trauma
to the head,

430
00:24:33,818 --> 00:24:35,031
same as the others.

431
00:24:35,071 --> 00:24:37,596
Does it make sense for him
to dump her like this?

432
00:24:37,622 --> 00:24:39,765
He's killed 2 people in 2 days.

433
00:24:39,791 --> 00:24:41,392
His fracturing is intensifying.

434
00:24:41,537 --> 00:24:44,469
When a criminal devolves like this,
they're capable of anything.

435
00:24:44,495 --> 00:24:47,215
JJ said a man reported
his wife missing last night.

436
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,641
Description matches the body.
Name's Lorraine Horton.

437
00:24:50,235 --> 00:24:52,911
Do we know anything about
her investment history?

438
00:24:52,937 --> 00:24:54,611
The team's looking
into it right now.

439
00:24:54,756 --> 00:24:58,250
Ok, so he killed his first victim
in Miami and then left town,

440
00:24:58,276 --> 00:25:01,320
came to Ft. Lauderdale,
killed his second victim here,

441
00:25:01,346 --> 00:25:03,236
but he didn't leave
town for his third.

442
00:25:03,381 --> 00:25:06,058
Is there a significance to him
staying in Ft. Lauderdale?

443
00:25:06,084 --> 00:25:08,360
Guys, what if his family lives here?

444
00:25:08,386 --> 00:25:10,696
That's why he's trying to
eliminate threats to himself here,

445
00:25:10,722 --> 00:25:13,999
'cause this is his home where
he needs to protect his identity.

446
00:25:14,855 --> 00:25:15,776
Hey, Garcia.

447
00:25:15,921 --> 00:25:18,136
I feel like I've been
sent on a wild snipe hunt.

448
00:25:18,162 --> 00:25:20,955
Do you have any idea how
many women in south Florida

449
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,689
lease luxury cars and rent mansions? I
will answer. Too many. That's how many.

450
00:25:24,721 --> 00:25:27,946
Ok, narrow the search down
to Ft. Lauderdale only.

451
00:25:27,972 --> 00:25:30,460
Look at women who moved
here 8 to 12 months ago,

452
00:25:30,605 --> 00:25:33,151
see if any of them have any
history with san diego.

453
00:25:33,177 --> 00:25:37,656
Ok. I'll call you back when
I find the elusive snipe creature.

454
00:25:43,354 --> 00:25:45,464
This is gonna be good for us.

455
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:47,299
I don't understand.

456
00:25:47,325 --> 00:25:49,468
I thought you would be happy.

457
00:25:49,494 --> 00:25:52,637
Just yesterday you were hell-bent
on moving us immediately.

458
00:25:52,663 --> 00:25:54,906
Yeah, and then you and J.D.
both said you wanted to stay,

459
00:25:54,932 --> 00:25:56,481
so I found a way
to make it happen.

460
00:25:56,626 --> 00:25:57,676
How?

461
00:25:57,702 --> 00:25:58,977
I just did.

462
00:25:59,842 --> 00:26:02,214
What is going on with you?

463
00:26:03,941 --> 00:26:05,784
You know what?

464
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:08,019
I thought I was doing you a favor.

465
00:26:08,045 --> 00:26:10,055
I don't have time for this.

466
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:21,955
Good afternoon.

467
00:26:23,094 --> 00:26:26,371
I'm Stuart. You asked
for the bank manager?

468
00:26:26,397 --> 00:26:29,374
Agents Rossi and Jareau, FBI.

469
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,697
We need some information
on a client named Lorraine Horton.

470
00:26:32,968 --> 00:26:34,413
Is Ms. Horton ok?

471
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:36,415
Can you check her
recent banking activities,

472
00:26:36,441 --> 00:26:38,210
see if there's anything unusual?

473
00:26:38,355 --> 00:26:41,176
Maybe a check written
to a person's corporation.

474
00:26:41,321 --> 00:26:43,822
I know she recently came
into more money.

475
00:26:43,848 --> 00:26:45,940
Her mother passed.
They sold the house

476
00:26:46,085 --> 00:26:47,966
and she got a pretty
good sum for it.

477
00:26:48,469 --> 00:26:50,028
She sold a house?

478
00:26:50,054 --> 00:26:51,163
Yes, sir.

479
00:26:51,189 --> 00:26:54,399
Wasn't the first victim
in real estate?

480
00:26:56,028 --> 00:26:59,085
We've been asking ourselves
how he finds his victims now.

481
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:01,242
We just found out Lorraine
got a large windfall

482
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,874
from selling her
mother's house.

483
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,371
Carla Marshall, the first
victim, was in real estate.

484
00:27:05,516 --> 00:27:07,813
When you sell a house,
your property becomes public record.

485
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:09,214
Your name goes on these lists.

486
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,216
Lists compiled by lead brokers

487
00:27:11,242 --> 00:27:13,039
and sold to the real
estate companies.

488
00:27:14,788 --> 00:27:15,554
Hey, pen.

489
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:18,690
Man, it is raining
snipe all up in here.

490
00:27:18,716 --> 00:27:21,593
Did you know that your boat
owners Frank and Dina Mckelson

491
00:27:21,619 --> 00:27:23,490
sold a house in Hawaii
about 8 months ago?

492
00:27:23,635 --> 00:27:26,154
Do any of them have a direct
connection to Carla Marshall?

493
00:27:26,299 --> 00:27:27,999
Carla generated these letters

494
00:27:28,025 --> 00:27:30,136
advertising the swanky
beachfront condos

495
00:27:30,161 --> 00:27:31,870
her company sells...
stay with me...

496
00:27:31,896 --> 00:27:34,773
Lorraine Horton, the lady who
was murdered this morning,

497
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,167
her address, along with
the mckelsons' address,

498
00:27:37,192 --> 00:27:39,658
are buried in a spreadsheet
in Carla's laptop.

499
00:27:39,686 --> 00:27:41,413
That's how the unsub
found his victims.

500
00:27:41,439 --> 00:27:42,981
He used Carla to get her leads.

501
00:27:43,007 --> 00:27:44,336
That's why he targeted her.

502
00:27:44,358 --> 00:27:47,121
She gave him access to a list of people
with a large amount of liquid assets.

503
00:27:47,144 --> 00:27:48,186
We need that list.

504
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:50,255
Already flying to you.
But that is not all, folks.

505
00:27:50,281 --> 00:27:51,833
I think I may have
found the wife.

506
00:27:51,868 --> 00:27:54,292
I did I search on women
who've lived in Ft. Lauderdale

507
00:27:54,318 --> 00:27:55,894
for the last 8 to 12 months,

508
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,663
who rent houses and cars
and have a history in San Diego.

509
00:27:58,689 --> 00:28:01,466
Came up with about
a dozen names, but...

510
00:28:01,492 --> 00:28:03,602
ooh, la la, only one
of them works in real estate.

511
00:28:03,628 --> 00:28:04,322
Who?

512
00:28:04,366 --> 00:28:06,404
Her name's Rebecca Hodges.
She has a 9-year-old son,

513
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:09,107
John Davison Hodges,
born in San Diego,

514
00:28:09,252 --> 00:28:11,998
father on birth certificate
listed as William Hodges. William.

515
00:28:12,042 --> 00:28:14,051
I got the address
of the house she's renting, too.

516
00:28:14,107 --> 00:28:16,473
Let's head over there.
Morgan, pull the son out of school.

517
00:28:16,502 --> 00:28:18,583
JJ and Reid, go over the list
of potential victims.

518
00:28:18,609 --> 00:28:20,550
If anybody knows the unsub,
send units to them.

519
00:28:21,108 --> 00:28:23,393
Ok, so I'm gonna go deal
with this client.

520
00:28:23,538 --> 00:28:25,661
Will you call me later?

521
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,361
Yeah, I will.

522
00:28:40,164 --> 00:28:42,641
Did you forget something?

523
00:28:44,468 --> 00:28:46,358
Are you a client of Bill's?

524
00:28:46,503 --> 00:28:47,395
Who?

525
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,281
Don't do that.
I saw him leaving here.

526
00:28:49,307 --> 00:28:51,049
I don't know
what you're talking about.

527
00:28:51,075 --> 00:28:52,317
You should leave.

528
00:28:52,343 --> 00:28:54,160
I saw you with my husband.

529
00:28:54,305 --> 00:28:56,388
Do you know we have a son?

530
00:28:56,414 --> 00:28:57,856
His name is J.D.

531
00:29:00,685 --> 00:29:03,395
You didn't know bill was married?

532
00:29:06,023 --> 00:29:09,134
I didn't know his name was Bill.

533
00:29:44,061 --> 00:29:46,064
Again, this is agent Jareau.

534
00:29:46,209 --> 00:29:48,421
It's very important that you
call me back. Thank you.

535
00:29:48,566 --> 00:29:50,809
Thank you.
Yeah, thanks so much.

536
00:29:50,835 --> 00:29:53,902
I just confirmed another potential victim.
I sent a unit over.

537
00:29:54,047 --> 00:29:55,780
I can't get a hold
of this one couple,

538
00:29:55,806 --> 00:29:57,315
Hector and Brooke Sanchez.

539
00:29:58,212 --> 00:30:00,051
Hurry up. Dad,
where are we going?

540
00:30:00,077 --> 00:30:02,120
We're going to get mom.
It's a surprise.

541
00:30:02,146 --> 00:30:04,194
What kind of surprise?

542
00:30:04,339 --> 00:30:05,690
We're going to Boston.

543
00:30:05,716 --> 00:30:07,907
But you said yesterday...

544
00:30:07,932 --> 00:30:10,295
just get in the car, ok?

545
00:30:10,321 --> 00:30:11,380
Hurry up.

546
00:30:23,367 --> 00:30:26,547
Do you know you pick
your nails when you're anxious?

547
00:30:27,747 --> 00:30:30,882
I've never been in a bureau
car chasing a killer before.

548
00:30:30,908 --> 00:30:33,785
You ready to meet
William face to face?

549
00:30:35,012 --> 00:30:37,288
It's about damn time.

550
00:31:15,152 --> 00:31:17,162
Dad, where are you going?

551
00:31:17,188 --> 00:31:20,294
Quiet. Just shut up
and let me think.

552
00:31:22,311 --> 00:31:23,461
Daddy...

553
00:31:27,598 --> 00:31:30,175
I'm sorry, kiddo.
I didn't mean to yell at you.

554
00:31:30,729 --> 00:31:32,177
Where's mommy?

555
00:31:32,931 --> 00:31:34,579
That's a good question.

556
00:31:40,303 --> 00:31:41,805
That's him calling.

557
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,575
Well, don't answer it.

558
00:31:47,112 --> 00:31:48,643
We need to talk.

559
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,286
I am pregnant.

560
00:31:51,939 --> 00:31:53,131
It's his.

561
00:31:53,617 --> 00:31:55,600
Oh, my god.

562
00:31:55,626 --> 00:31:57,268
Come on, pick up.

563
00:32:01,465 --> 00:32:03,208
Ok, we're going to, uh...

564
00:32:03,234 --> 00:32:06,277
go hang out somewhere and wait
for mommy to call back, all right?

565
00:32:06,546 --> 00:32:07,382
Ok.

566
00:32:07,638 --> 00:32:09,367
What about that
one couple from earlier?

567
00:32:09,423 --> 00:32:11,000
His office said
he's out of town.

568
00:32:11,066 --> 00:32:12,865
I haven't been able
to get ahold of her yet.

569
00:32:12,903 --> 00:32:14,358
- It's Morgan.
- Hey, Morgan.

570
00:32:14,419 --> 00:32:16,286
Yeah, Reid, listen,
I'm at the son's school.

571
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:17,788
Principal says that J.D. Hodges

572
00:32:17,818 --> 00:32:19,527
was pulled out
of class 45 minutes ago.

573
00:32:19,552 --> 00:32:20,859
By who?
The unsub.

574
00:32:20,885 --> 00:32:22,224
They're in the wind, kid.

575
00:32:22,254 --> 00:32:24,020
He's gonna try
and leave with his family.

576
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,081
All right, thanks,
I'll let everyone know.

577
00:32:26,226 --> 00:32:27,849
Garcia?
What up, JJ?

578
00:32:27,994 --> 00:32:30,923
Can you find out
if Rebecca Hodges has a cell phone?

579
00:32:30,947 --> 00:32:32,894
We want to try and track
where she is right now.

580
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,839
"Uno momento."

581
00:32:36,167 --> 00:32:38,124
Something's weird.
What?

582
00:32:38,269 --> 00:32:40,590
The wife has 2 cell
phones listed in her name.

583
00:32:40,601 --> 00:32:42,217
One could be hers,
one could be his?

584
00:32:42,282 --> 00:32:43,753
He put them both in her name.

585
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,484
Yeah, but they're both active
in the same quadrant right now.

586
00:32:46,829 --> 00:32:47,786
Where?

587
00:32:47,812 --> 00:32:50,955
Some posh Ft. Lauderdale neighborhood.

588
00:32:50,981 --> 00:32:52,791
Wait a second.

589
00:32:52,817 --> 00:32:56,094
A couple on our potential victims
list lives in the same area.

590
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,595
Hector and Brooke Sanchez.

591
00:32:57,621 --> 00:33:00,098
That's the woman
I can't get ahold of.

592
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:01,966
Hotch.

593
00:33:01,992 --> 00:33:03,034
Ok, got it, Reid.

594
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,036
Direct everyone
to the Sanchez house.

595
00:33:05,062 --> 00:33:06,168
Thanks.

596
00:33:06,199 --> 00:33:08,039
What's the wife doing
at a victim's house?

597
00:33:08,065 --> 00:33:10,108
Were we wrong about her?

598
00:33:10,134 --> 00:33:11,543
Do you think she's complicit?

599
00:33:11,569 --> 00:33:14,779
I don't think so. If she was,
he'd use her in the con.

600
00:33:14,805 --> 00:33:17,088
He told me his name
was hunter Portland.

601
00:33:17,233 --> 00:33:19,250
How long have you been seeing him?

602
00:33:19,276 --> 00:33:21,653
We vacationed in St. Croix together.

603
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:23,121
What? When?

604
00:33:23,147 --> 00:33:24,522
Last month.

605
00:33:26,116 --> 00:33:29,294
He said he was in Boston
on a business trip.

606
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,895
Brooke, you here?

607
00:33:47,315 --> 00:33:48,724
You must think I'm an idiot.

608
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:49,691
It's not true.

609
00:33:49,717 --> 00:33:51,382
How could you do this
to your family?

610
00:33:51,407 --> 00:33:53,241
I provide everything for my family.

611
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:55,163
Were you just after my money
this whole time?

612
00:33:55,189 --> 00:33:57,819
No. No, I told you I was
gonna take care of you.

613
00:33:57,844 --> 00:33:59,857
All those times
you traveled for work...

614
00:34:00,002 --> 00:34:01,193
are there other women?

615
00:34:01,338 --> 00:34:02,893
God, what are you even doing here?!

616
00:34:02,918 --> 00:34:03,939
Daddy?

617
00:34:03,965 --> 00:34:06,174
I told you to wait in the car.

618
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,743
J.D., come here.

619
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:10,545
Please, just let him come here.

620
00:34:10,571 --> 00:34:12,547
You think that
I would hurt my own son?

621
00:34:12,573 --> 00:34:15,817
Well, you're obviously
capable of anything.

622
00:34:15,843 --> 00:34:18,034
Please, Bill,
he doesn't need to see this.

623
00:34:18,053 --> 00:34:20,510
How long did you think you were
gong to get away with this, hunter?

624
00:34:20,655 --> 00:34:23,209
Bill, let's just leave. Just
stop talking, both of you!

625
00:34:23,354 --> 00:34:25,193
Bill. Shut up!

626
00:34:41,069 --> 00:34:44,913
We got a car down the street
and one in the driveway.

627
00:34:44,939 --> 00:34:47,568
Both plates match the wife's name.

628
00:34:47,605 --> 00:34:49,367
Remember,
there's a 9-year-old boy in there

629
00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:51,367
and I wouldn't put it past
him to hurt his own family.

630
00:34:51,395 --> 00:34:52,237
Or himself.

631
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,356
Ok, we'll take the back.
You ready?

632
00:34:54,382 --> 00:34:55,122
Bill!

633
00:34:55,147 --> 00:34:57,893
You really are
a son of a bitch, hunter.

634
00:34:57,919 --> 00:34:58,796
Bill...

635
00:34:59,587 --> 00:35:00,695
whatever!

636
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,731
Bill.
Let's just go.

637
00:35:07,395 --> 00:35:08,403
Let's go!

638
00:35:08,886 --> 00:35:09,738
Shut up!

639
00:35:09,885 --> 00:35:10,739
Shut up!

640
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:11,825
Daddy!

641
00:35:13,095 --> 00:35:14,290
Stop. No.

642
00:35:15,131 --> 00:35:15,981
J.D.!

643
00:35:21,706 --> 00:35:23,378
FBI. Put your hands in the air.

644
00:35:23,523 --> 00:35:24,492
Oh, my god.

645
00:35:24,637 --> 00:35:25,777
Please step back.

646
00:35:25,922 --> 00:35:27,376
Bill, let him go.

647
00:35:27,521 --> 00:35:29,825
Let the boy go to his mother
and put your hands up.

648
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:32,013
You must be tired,
keeping up with all these lies.

649
00:35:32,158 --> 00:35:33,914
You don't need to do this anymore.

650
00:35:34,059 --> 00:35:34,901
Let him go.

651
00:35:35,046 --> 00:35:36,998
Bill, please let him go.

652
00:35:39,168 --> 00:35:40,373
Daddy...

653
00:35:46,091 --> 00:35:47,375
J.D...

654
00:35:48,181 --> 00:35:49,811
go to your mom, ok?

655
00:35:52,807 --> 00:35:54,449
Go to your mom.

656
00:35:54,475 --> 00:35:57,085
Sweetie, come here.
Put your hands up.

657
00:35:57,111 --> 00:35:58,920
Put your hands up.

658
00:36:06,921 --> 00:36:08,530
Don't do that!

659
00:36:08,556 --> 00:36:10,766
Take your hands out of your pockets!

660
00:36:12,655 --> 00:36:14,603
Don't!

661
00:37:51,575 --> 00:37:54,055
"What a tangled web we weave

662
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,671
when first we practice to deceive."

663
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,540
Sir Walter Scott.

664
00:38:10,878 --> 00:38:13,388
Do you think
my husband did all this?

665
00:38:14,336 --> 00:38:15,582
I'm afraid so.

666
00:38:16,384 --> 00:38:18,918
The man I lived with for 10 years

667
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:20,653
was loving and gentle.

668
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,797
He isn't capable of this.

669
00:38:22,823 --> 00:38:25,734
There's more about
him that we don't know.

670
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,903
You should be prepared.

671
00:38:27,929 --> 00:38:31,306
You're going
to be interviewed in detail.

672
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,577
Right now I want
to take my son home.

673
00:38:35,603 --> 00:38:39,014
Ok. I'll have someone drive you.

674
00:38:57,558 --> 00:38:58,633
Mommy!

675
00:38:58,659 --> 00:39:01,903
Mommy's here, baby.

676
00:39:04,498 --> 00:39:08,043
You know your daddy loved you
more than anything, right?

677
00:39:08,069 --> 00:39:09,644
I know.

678
00:39:16,978 --> 00:39:18,820
So where do you want these?

679
00:39:19,171 --> 00:39:20,866
I don't care.

680
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,719
Are you ok?

681
00:39:24,452 --> 00:39:25,860
I thought he had a weapon.

682
00:39:25,886 --> 00:39:29,030
Yeah. That was a justified shot.

683
00:39:29,882 --> 00:39:31,787
Why did he do that?

684
00:39:31,932 --> 00:39:33,568
He had a wife, a son.

685
00:39:33,594 --> 00:39:35,299
A guy like that,

686
00:39:35,444 --> 00:39:38,033
he likes his car,
his house, his lifestyle.

687
00:39:38,178 --> 00:39:40,742
He knew he wasn't going
to do well in prison.

688
00:39:40,768 --> 00:39:44,082
So he decided his own fate.

689
00:39:44,905 --> 00:39:48,249
I never even found
out his real name.

690
00:39:50,416 --> 00:39:52,053
Does it matter?
