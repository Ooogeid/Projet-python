00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,910
If you think you can live
with this on your conscience.

3
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,413
That's not how it works,sweetie.

4
00:00:39,577 --> 00:00:41,438
Yeah,you can put it out of your head.

5
00:00:41,602 --> 00:00:43,800
It'll just go to your heart.

6
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,173
Well,then it'll go somewhere else.

7
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:49,853
I don't know. Your liver,your pancreas.

8
00:00:50,017 --> 00:00:52,600
Why do you think so
many people get cancer?

9
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,633
That's how it works.
That's what guilt does.

10
00:00:55,797 --> 00:00:58,140
It makes people sick.

11
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,233
I'm not gonna tell you what to do.

12
00:01:05,397 --> 00:01:08,458
Well,I'm sorry that it came off that
w,but you can understand my position.

13
00:01:08,622 --> 00:01:10,633
I'm friends with both of you.

14
00:01:10,797 --> 00:01:13,860
No,of course I'm not
gonna tell him,janet.

15
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:20,570
I love you,but I'm sorry,a couple of glasses
of wine does not justify 3 whatever.

16
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,570
Hey,I'm coming to a bad
spot on 7. I might lose you.

17
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,490
Hello? Janet?

18
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,120
Great.

19
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,950
Hey there!

20
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,943
Penelope is hoping the migraine
she woke up with this morning

21
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:31,150
Goes away in time for the
small wonder marathon tonight.

22
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,630
You decent?
- Never.

23
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,780
Look at you. Did somebody die?

24
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,663
No.
- B.a.u. Yearbook photo?

25
00:03:43,827 --> 00:03:46,133
No,I have a job interview.

26
00:03:46,297 --> 00:03:49,253
Hey,rock star,you up for
that systems promotion?

27
00:03:49,417 --> 00:03:52,243
No,no. A friend of mine is
a headhunter for the nsa.

28
00:03:52,407 --> 00:03:55,618
Uh,they're looking for analysts
versed in cyber warfare.

29
00:03:55,782 --> 00:03:57,293
Really? That sounds exciting.

30
00:03:57,457 --> 00:03:59,853
Oh,it is. Yeah,the job
is totally cutting edge.

31
00:04:00,017 --> 00:04:01,263
Yeah,it sounds like it.

32
00:04:01,427 --> 00:04:04,620
Are you sure you're gonna want to make
the commute to fort mead every day?

33
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,960
actually, it's a-- it's
an overseas position.

34
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,233
Where overseas?

35
00:04:13,397 --> 00:04:15,750
I can't say. It's classified.

36
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:18,738
Are we breaking up right now?

37
00:04:18,902 --> 00:04:21,243
Uh,no. No. Uh--uh--they
haven't hired me yet.

38
00:04:21,407 --> 00:04:23,653
It--it's my
final interview.

39
00:04:23,817 --> 00:04:25,723
Final?

40
00:04:25,887 --> 00:04:27,838
How long have you known about this?

41
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:31,810
A few weeks. I didn't want to say
anything to you until it was real.

42
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,340
Ok. Ok.

43
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,100
And... And this is what you want?

44
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,350
I'm not sure.

45
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,753
I mean,the long-distance
thing would be rough.

46
00:04:45,917 --> 00:04:49,500
Yeah,it would be,considering you
can't even tell me where you're going.

47
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,523
Well, i could if
you applied with me.

48
00:04:52,687 --> 00:04:54,993
I mean,they need other people.

49
00:04:55,157 --> 00:04:57,540
Leave the b.a.u.?

50
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,410
Just think about it?

51
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,743
My head hurts,and jj
just brought in a case.

52
00:05:05,907 --> 00:05:08,000
I need to get back to work.

53
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,848
An unsub that kills with his car.

54
00:05:16,012 --> 00:05:17,243
I haven't seen that before.

55
00:05:17,407 --> 00:05:19,073
Neither have the police in bend,oregon.

56
00:05:19,237 --> 00:05:20,998
Which is why they need our help.

57
00:05:21,162 --> 00:05:22,838
Two victims in the last 12 days.

58
00:05:23,002 --> 00:05:26,188
First was hit while on a
morning jog - maria delgado, 23.

59
00:05:26,352 --> 00:05:29,693
The second was a stranded
motorist,shannon makely,43.

60
00:05:29,857 --> 00:05:31,518
And what makes the locals
think that they were connected?

61
00:05:31,682 --> 00:05:35,178
Well,for one thing,they were both
backed over after the initial impact.

62
00:05:35,342 --> 00:05:36,493
No accident there.

63
00:05:36,657 --> 00:05:38,033
They matched treads at both scenes.

64
00:05:38,197 --> 00:05:39,408
Large wheels,all-terrain.

65
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:43,713
Wounds also indicate a raised bumper,so
they're thinking large suv or truck.

66
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:44,943
Do they know the model or make?

67
00:05:45,107 --> 00:05:46,343
Uh,tires aren't factory iue.

68
00:05:46,507 --> 00:05:48,348
They could be on a number
of different models.

69
00:05:48,512 --> 00:05:50,590
No witnesses to either incident?

70
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,238
A hit-and-run is
loud,draws attention.

71
00:05:53,402 --> 00:05:55,308
Somebody usually sees something.

72
00:05:55,472 --> 00:05:57,743
Both victims were
attacked in secluded areas.

73
00:05:57,907 --> 00:05:59,383
2 tons of metal make a hell of a weapon.

74
00:05:59,547 --> 00:06:02,113
Serial killers have been known to
become rather attached to their vehicles.

75
00:06:02,277 --> 00:06:04,078
Bittaker and norris even
have theirs a nickname.

76
00:06:04,242 --> 00:06:05,018
Murder mac.

77
00:06:05,182 --> 00:06:07,903
Bittaker and norris were sexual
sadists. There's no sign of torture here.

78
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:09,303
It sounds like thrill kills.

79
00:06:09,467 --> 00:06:11,073
Opportunistic.

80
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:13,893
Easy targets randomly selected.

81
00:06:14,057 --> 00:06:17,063
With this type of impact,the vehicle
shouldn't be hard to pick out of a lineup.

82
00:06:17,227 --> 00:06:19,203
Yeah,there should be
significant front-end damage.

83
00:06:19,367 --> 00:06:22,830
Somehow I don't think
it's gonna be that easy.

Booth tarkington.

90
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,963
Well,I think it's safe to
assume our unsub is male.

91
00:07:33,127 --> 00:07:36,668
I agree with you,given what we know
about aggressive driving and road rage.

92
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:40,273
And the fact that men ha an
unnatural bond with their cars.

93
00:07:40,437 --> 00:07:43,023
That is true.
- Wait a minute. I don't know about unnatural.

94
00:07:43,187 --> 00:07:46,123
I once dated a guy who washed his
car more than he washed his hair.

95
00:07:46,287 --> 00:07:48,058
A nice car needs love.

96
00:07:48,222 --> 00:07:49,803
And a woman doesn't?

97
00:07:49,967 --> 00:07:52,110
I'm not qualified to answer that.

98
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:56,468
I'm just saying,big
car -it's phallic.

99
00:07:56,632 --> 00:07:59,003
So he's compensating?
- Or overcompensating.

100
00:07:59,167 --> 00:08:00,133
Impotent?
- Possibly.

101
00:08:00,297 --> 00:08:02,753
If the unsub sees himself
as physically defective,

102
00:08:02,917 --> 00:08:05,653
The car not only gives him the
power and control he otherwise lacks,

103
00:08:05,817 --> 00:08:07,813
but it also serves as a shield.

104
00:08:07,977 --> 00:08:09,758
A way to avoid physical contact?

105
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:14,453
Power and control,female victims
that almost reads like a rape profile.

106
00:08:14,617 --> 00:08:15,763
Vehicular rape.

107
00:08:15,927 --> 00:08:18,083
Rape and thrill kill are
two very different profiles.

108
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,468
What does the victimology tell us?

109
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:23,753
Nothing yet. Shannon makely was a
white,married,43-year-old commities trader,

110
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:29,020
Maria delgado was a 23-year-old hispanic
grad student,competitive tri-athlete.

111
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,810
So far,gender's our only link.

112
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,650
Hopefully the crime
scenes will tell us more.

113

<i>{\a6}******</i>

114
00:08:41,347 --> 00:08:45,383
She lived a little outside of town,was on
her way home from work when she broke down.

115
00:08:45,547 --> 00:08:48,823
So she breaks down way back there
and she gets out and starts walking.

116
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,473
Why not call for help?

117
00:08:50,637 --> 00:08:51,758
No service.

118
00:08:51,922 --> 00:08:56,330
He made a complete stop
here,then hit the gas.

119
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,308
Full stop in the middle of the road?

120
00:08:58,472 --> 00:08:59,798
Take it there's not a
lot of traffic out here.

121
00:08:59,962 --> 00:09:02,753
Not on this stretch. Not at
that time of day,at least.

122
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,753
Done working by 3:00 in the afternoon.

123
00:09:04,917 --> 00:09:07,353
Broker. Specialized in foreign markets.

124
00:09:07,517 --> 00:09:10,590
Time difference made for some odd hours.

125
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,763
What are you thinking about,rossi?

126
00:09:14,927 --> 00:09:17,838
What are the odds she
breaks down right here?

127
00:09:18,002 --> 00:09:21,623
No phone,no traffic,no
witnesses,nowhere to run.

128
00:09:21,787 --> 00:09:23,730
Perfect place for an ambush.

129
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,593
Not a very popular jogging area.

130
00:09:26,757 --> 00:09:28,973
Aren't too many people who can
take that hill coming up here.

131
00:09:29,137 --> 00:09:30,703
Well,she was a tri-athlete.

132
00:09:30,867 --> 00:09:35,120
We figured she jogged in off the main
road,heading for the trail up here.

133
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:38,933
Assailant drove in behind her
and ran her down right here.

134
00:09:39,097 --> 00:09:41,508
A woman jogging alone?

135
00:09:41,672 --> 00:09:43,673
No,she would have known
if someone was tailing her.

136
00:09:43,837 --> 00:09:45,850
So maybe he was already here.

137
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,348
What's the story with
all this equipment?

138
00:09:48,512 --> 00:09:49,933
Construction stalled out months ago.

139
00:09:50,097 --> 00:09:52,193
No reason for anyone to be up here.

140
00:09:52,357 --> 00:09:54,370
Nice and private.

141
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:57,900
It's the ideal spot to run
somebody down without being seen.

142
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,583
A little convenient.

143
00:09:59,747 --> 00:10:01,043
Too convenient.

144
00:10:01,207 --> 00:10:04,303
What if it was her? What if she
were the reason he was up here?

145
00:10:04,467 --> 00:10:07,220
You don't think this
was a random attack.

146
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,080
Oil.

147
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,540
He was lying in wait.

148
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,938
He may have specifically
targeted these women.

149
00:10:17,102 --> 00:10:18,643
That takes thrill kill off the table.

150
00:10:18,807 --> 00:10:20,613
Because the murders
were planned in advance?

151
00:10:20,777 --> 00:10:22,123
Yeah. This type of stalking
behavior indicates a personal motive.

152
00:10:22,287 --> 00:10:23,700
<i>{\a6}Bend******</i>

153
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,438
There's a reason he chose these victims.

154
00:10:26,602 --> 00:10:27,538
So you think he knows them?

155
00:10:27,702 --> 00:10:31,128
Well,he knew their work
schedules,jogging routes,drive patterns.

156
00:10:31,292 --> 00:10:33,028
That would explain how
he knew where to strike.

157
00:10:33,192 --> 00:10:35,303
It explains the delgado
girl. She was on a run.

158
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:38,628
But he couldn't have known shannon
makely's car was gonna break down out there.

159
00:10:38,792 --> 00:10:39,568
Did you look at her car?

160
00:10:39,732 --> 00:10:41,833
Guys at impound said
the water pump blew.

161
00:10:41,997 --> 00:10:43,838
They said it's a common enough problem.

162
00:10:44,002 --> 00:10:45,483
Maybe we should take a closer look.

163
00:10:45,647 --> 00:10:48,090
Why don't you head over there,let
me know what you find out.

164
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,618
Shannon makely's husband is here.

165
00:10:50,782 --> 00:10:53,080
I just want it to make sense.

166
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,263
But this,i...

167
00:10:55,427 --> 00:10:59,250
We may be able to ma some
sense out of it with your help.

168
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,000
Do you recognize that woman?

169
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,363
No. Should i?

170
00:11:04,527 --> 00:11:06,558
She was the first victim.

171
00:11:06,722 --> 00:11:10,273
We're trying to determine if she was
connected to your wife in some way.

172
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:11,183
Connected?

173
00:11:11,347 --> 00:11:15,563
We believe he may have been following
them,gathering some sort of information.

174
00:11:15,727 --> 00:11:18,793
Did shannon ever
mention noticing anyone?

175
00:11:18,957 --> 00:11:20,478
No.

176
00:11:20,642 --> 00:11:24,113
Did you ever notice anyone out of
the ordinary in your neighborhood,

177
00:11:24,277 --> 00:11:27,343
Maybe someone who was walking or
driving by the house repeatedly?

178
00:11:27,507 --> 00:11:28,678
No.

179
00:11:28,842 --> 00:11:31,890
What about a truck or a large suv?

180
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:39,943
Thursday,I was expecting a package.

181
00:11:40,107 --> 00:11:41,373
I kept checking the street.

182
00:11:41,537 --> 00:11:45,153
There was a truck parked a couple of
houses down. I didn't recognize it.

183
00:11:45,317 --> 00:11:47,383
Could you see anyone inside?

184
00:11:47,547 --> 00:11:49,773
I couldn't tell. The
windows were blacked out.

185
00:11:49,937 --> 00:11:50,923
Tinted?

186
00:11:51,087 --> 00:11:54,530
Yeah,only all the way around,like
you see with limousines.

187
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:00,170
Do you think that you would recognize
the truck if you saw it again?

188
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,840
Maybe.

189
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,680
<i>{\a6}FBI******</i>

190
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,943
How's it coming,gil?

191
00:12:14,107 --> 00:12:17,093
It's coming. These roof
sections are brutal.

192
00:12:17,257 --> 00:12:19,820
Yeah. Maybe you want
to take an early day.

193
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,660
Don't I wish.
- Look,I can smell the booze,man.

194
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,673
I can tell bert you went home sick.

195
00:12:30,837 --> 00:12:33,040
But...
- I can handle it.

196
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:41,740
You're sliding,man.
Mistakes,missed deadlines.

197
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,700
Is everything ok?

198
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:08,003
We figured it was the water pump
because it was pretty much melted.

199
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:10,240
But we didn't figure on this.

200
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,643
Car's pretty new. That wouldn't
be normal wear and tear,would it?

201
00:13:18,807 --> 00:13:20,583
No. Rest of the line's
in good condition.

202
00:13:20,747 --> 00:13:21,948
Someone punctured it.

203
00:13:22,112 --> 00:13:24,350
You can tell from the smooth edge.

204
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,763
How did they do it?

205
00:13:25,927 --> 00:13:27,383
Probably reached a blade
right through the grille.

206
00:13:27,547 --> 00:13:29,313
Penknife. Something like that.

207
00:13:29,477 --> 00:13:31,488
They wouldn't have even
had to pop the hood.

208
00:13:31,652 --> 00:13:34,683
And if she drove away without water in
the radiator,it explains the overheating.

209
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,943
It explains the pump,too.

210
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:39,990
Could somebody possibly gauge how far she could
have traveled with the car in this condition?

211
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,070
Someone who knows cars could
make an educated guess,sure.

212
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,620
Thank you. Appreciate it.

213
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,673
Sabotage.

214
00:13:49,837 --> 00:13:51,348
He's more focused than we thought.

215
00:13:51,512 --> 00:13:53,243
Well organized,highly motivated.

216
00:13:53,407 --> 00:13:55,460
By what,though? What do
these women have in common?

217
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:58,878
Different ages,appearance,social class.

218
00:13:59,042 --> 00:14:01,228
He's not hunting a specific type.

219
00:14:01,392 --> 00:14:02,738
Their only connection is the unsub.

220
00:14:02,902 --> 00:14:05,018
There has to have been
contact before the attacks.

221
00:14:05,182 --> 00:14:07,663
But we profiled a guy
who's afraid of contact.

222
00:14:07,827 --> 00:14:08,808
The truck's a shield.

223
00:14:08,972 --> 00:14:10,598
Maybe the contact's incidental.

224
00:14:10,762 --> 00:14:13,740
There's something he
perceives in their exchange.

225
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:18,870
Something about his perception
triggers his fixation.

226
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,108
Could be the way she looks
at him,something she says,

227
00:14:30,272 --> 00:14:32,950
or even something as trivial
as what she's wearing.

228
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,240
Whatever it is,the victims have
no idea what they set in motion.

229
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,548
These are all ford models.

230
00:14:56,712 --> 00:14:58,433
The grilles are kind
of like you described.

231
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,433
Yeah,I guess.

232
00:15:00,597 --> 00:15:01,718
It didn't have that emblem,though.

233
00:15:01,882 --> 00:15:03,953
And no hood ornament. Nothing like that.

234
00:15:04,117 --> 00:15:06,603
I understand this is hard,but
this really will help us.

235
00:15:06,767 --> 00:15:08,930
I'll keep looking.

236
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,408
How's it going?

237
00:15:10,572 --> 00:15:12,728
Well,we're down to an older
model,black,american made.

238
00:15:12,892 --> 00:15:15,338
Sounds like he debadged the
truck so nobody could i.d.him.

239
00:15:15,502 --> 00:15:18,383
I can start a list from
dmv matching what we've got.

240
00:15:18,547 --> 00:15:20,263
A list like that's gonna
kill a lot of trees.

241
00:15:20,427 --> 00:15:22,103
He's right. The truck's
only gonna get us so far.

242
00:15:22,267 --> 00:15:23,933
What we need to do is
build on the profile.

243
00:15:24,097 --> 00:15:25,583
Well,he's mechanically inclined.

244
00:15:25,747 --> 00:15:27,713
He certainly knows his
away around an engine block.

245
00:15:27,877 --> 00:15:30,388
And he can pull a dent,too,if he's
fixing the body damage to his truck.

246
00:15:30,552 --> 00:15:32,283
Both victims were killed
during pri office hours.

247
00:15:32,447 --> 00:15:33,988
It means he has a
flexible work schedule.

248
00:15:34,152 --> 00:15:35,253
Or he might not be working at all.

249
00:15:35,417 --> 00:15:39,408
Stalking someone,getting to know their
schedule, it's a pretty serious time commitment.

250
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:41,318
8% of the state's out of work.

251
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,213
And job loss is a classic stressor.

252
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:46,523
It's a start. Look for men who are
employed as mechanics,body shops,

253
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:49,333
And look for those with criminal
records-- Reckless driving and assault.

254
00:15:49,497 --> 00:15:50,868
Two murders in two weeks?

255
00:15:51,032 --> 00:15:52,473
It's not much of a cooling-off period.

256
00:15:52,637 --> 00:15:55,083
He's not gonna wait for another
opportunity to present itself.

257
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:57,470
Now he'll create one.

258
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,670
Son
of a

259
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,050
great.

260
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,490
help me!

261
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,470
Hold the elevator!

262
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,000
Hold it!

263
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,143
Impact nearly cut him in two.

264
00:17:47,307 --> 00:17:49,733
His name is victor costella,podiatrist.

265
00:17:49,897 --> 00:17:51,753
He works in the building.
- Male victim.

266
00:17:51,917 --> 00:17:54,178
So much for the vehicular rape theory.

267
00:17:54,342 --> 00:17:56,928
He ran down from the level
above to try to get away.

268
00:17:57,092 --> 00:17:59,223
Initial collision was up there?

269
00:17:59,387 --> 00:18:01,490
Let's see it.

270
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,253
This is the victim's car?
- Yeah. Why?

271
00:18:06,417 --> 00:18:07,743
Uh,excuse me for a second.

272
00:18:07,907 --> 00:18:10,083
Garcia,I need you to
look into something.

273
00:18:10,247 --> 00:18:11,638
It's a reserved spot.

274
00:18:11,802 --> 00:18:16,393
Unsub knew where he was gonna park,must have
gotten here early and picked this spot right across.

275
00:18:16,557 --> 00:18:18,960
Somebody might have seen him waiting.
- Somebody did.

276
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,593
Talked to an x-ray
tech on the third floor.

277
00:18:21,757 --> 00:18:23,073
Noticed a truck when she arrived.

278
00:18:23,237 --> 00:18:24,423
And he was inside it?

279
00:18:24,587 --> 00:18:26,378
Yeah,but she couldn't see
him because of the tint.

280
00:18:26,542 --> 00:18:28,473
So how did she know he
was inside the truck?

281
00:18:28,637 --> 00:18:31,260
She said the window was
cracked. Occupant was smoking.

282
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:40,030
I don't suppose your people
found any cigarette butts.

283
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,410
What time did the,uh,tech get in?

284
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,193
10 a.m.

285
00:18:47,357 --> 00:18:49,553
7 hours.

286
00:18:49,717 --> 00:18:53,040
Proper addict could kill a whole pack.

287
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:56,313
Did you ever smoke?

288
00:18:56,477 --> 00:18:58,278
I used to do a lot of things.

289
00:18:58,442 --> 00:19:00,478
Bet you never did this.

290
00:19:00,642 --> 00:19:02,913
He field-stripped
it. - What is that?

291
00:19:03,077 --> 00:19:07,073
Something they teach soldiers to
avoid leang traces in the field.

292
00:19:07,237 --> 00:19:11,193
They squeeze out the filter,then
ball up the surrounding paper.

293
00:19:11,357 --> 00:19:13,243
Ok,so our guy could be ex-military.

294
00:19:13,407 --> 00:19:16,320
We can get dna on this. Maybe
we'll get lucky,he's in the system.

295
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:20,063
If he's military,why would he
choose a truck as his weapon?

296
00:19:20,227 --> 00:19:22,083
Maybe he drove a tank.

297
00:19:22,247 --> 00:19:27,833
That's a good questi using a vehicle
on the open road is one thing,but...

298
00:19:27,997 --> 00:19:29,743
This is close quarters.
- Yeah.

299
00:19:29,907 --> 00:19:31,353
A truck is loud,it draws attention.

300
00:19:31,517 --> 00:19:33,553
Plus he risked rendering it inoperable.

301
00:19:33,717 --> 00:19:35,583
Doesn't make any sense.
- It does to him.

302
00:19:35,747 --> 00:19:39,333
He needs to kill this
way. I just don't know why.

303
00:19:39,497 --> 00:19:42,463
Guys,I think I know what
connects the victims.

304
00:19:42,627 --> 00:19:44,998
All of the victims
drove red 2-door coupes.

305
00:19:45,162 --> 00:19:46,468
Don't you think that
could be a coincidence?

306
00:19:46,632 --> 00:19:48,178
It's statistically significant.

307
00:19:48,342 --> 00:19:50,228
We haven't been able to find
any other common denominators.

308
00:19:50,392 --> 00:19:52,803
If the unsub is targeting
people because of their cars,

309
00:19:52,967 --> 00:19:55,198
Then his initial contact with
them would have been on the road.

310
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:55,943
Exactly.

311
00:19:56,107 --> 00:20:00,618
I spoke to the families about the victims'
daily car travel,how they got to work,the gym.

312
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:03,303
There's one road all the
victims have in common.

313
00:20:03,467 --> 00:20:05,390
Route 7.

314
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,893
That mean something to you?

315
00:20:08,057 --> 00:20:10,090
Maybe we should take a drive.

316
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:15,233
Anyone living outside bend who
commutes toward eugene uses route 7.

317
00:20:15,397 --> 00:20:17,953
It's the most dangerous
stretch of highway in the state.

318
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:19,828
They call it "suicide 7."

319
00:20:19,992 --> 00:20:21,668
These crosses represent accidents?

320
00:20:21,832 --> 00:20:25,483
Fatalities. The fire chief put them
up to remind drivers to be careful.

321
00:20:25,647 --> 00:20:26,738
2 lanes,no dividers.

322
00:20:26,902 --> 00:20:28,528
I'm assuming there's a
lot of head-on collisions.

323
00:20:28,692 --> 00:20:30,493
Either that or they go off the side.

324
00:20:30,657 --> 00:20:32,888
Reid,you mentioned the possibility
of a physical limitation,

325
00:20:33,052 --> 00:20:35,738
Something that kept the unsub from
attacking in the traditional way.

326
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:38,363
Yeah,I was thinking about impotence,but
we've ruled out sexual motivation.

327
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,833
What if he'd been involved in a crash?

328
00:20:40,997 --> 00:20:42,980
On this road.

329
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,968
If the unsub is disabled,it
explains why he uses a truck.

330
00:20:46,132 --> 00:20:48,570
It gives him power,mobility.

331
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:50,763
But what?

332
00:20:50,927 --> 00:20:54,383
The idea that he's avenging his own physical
suffering speaks to a victim mentality

333
00:20:54,547 --> 00:20:56,803
that's inconsient with the profile.

334
00:20:56,967 --> 00:20:59,610
Maybe it's not just
about his own suffering.

335
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,270
wake up,honey.

336
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,480
Help me!

337
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:09,858
As we speak,this profile and a
description of the unsub's truck

338
00:22:10,022 --> 00:22:12,008
Are being released to
state and national media.

339
00:22:12,172 --> 00:22:13,453
In addition to what we already know,

340
00:22:13,617 --> 00:22:17,533
We believe the unsub is
ex-military,most likely army or marines.

341
00:22:17,697 --> 00:22:19,973
We also believe he's
physically handicapped.

342
00:22:20,137 --> 00:22:22,343
From combat?
- From an automobile accident.

343
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:26,178
An accident that may have occurred along
route 7,where the unsub finds his victims.

344
00:22:26,342 --> 00:22:29,088
And that has something to do with
why he's going after red coupes?

345
00:22:29,252 --> 00:22:33,258
We believe that he holds the driver of a
comparable vehicle responsible for his accident.

346
00:22:33,422 --> 00:22:36,393
And this person is the object of
his rage,but unable to confront them,

347
00:22:36,557 --> 00:22:38,063
He's taking revenge against a surrogate.

348
00:22:38,227 --> 00:22:43,463
These boxes contain accident reports from
a strip of route 7 between bend and eugene.

349
00:22:43,627 --> 00:22:44,683
There's about 5 years' worth.

350
00:22:44,847 --> 00:22:46,763
We're gonna need everyone you
can spare to comb through them.

351
00:22:46,927 --> 00:22:49,443
We've also compiled a list of
local rehabilitation facilities

352
00:22:49,607 --> 00:22:51,103
Where the unsub may
have gone to recover.

353
00:22:51,267 --> 00:22:53,663
Use the profile as you
canvass these places.

354
00:22:53,827 --> 00:22:57,183
Remember,we're looking for a white
male in his early 40s,former military...

355
00:22:57,347 --> 00:23:00,583
Who may have sustained serious
injury in a car accident.

356
00:23:00,747 --> 00:23:03,923
Though only owners of red coupes
have been targeted at this point,

357
00:23:04,087 --> 00:23:07,483
We're asking all the driving
public to be vigilant on the road.

358
00:23:07,647 --> 00:23:09,308
And if you know anyone
who fits this description,

359
00:23:09,472 --> 00:23:13,220
Please contact the bend police
department immediately. Thank you.

360
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:18,090
Gil? I could use some help in here.

361
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:27,243
I've got bare feet here. Could
you maybe sweep up the glass?

362
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:28,933
I think I have to go.

363
00:23:29,097 --> 00:23:30,343
What?
- I'm sorry.

364
00:23:30,507 --> 00:23:32,223
Where are you going?

365
00:23:32,387 --> 00:23:35,073
Damn it! Gil,wait!

366
00:23:35,237 --> 00:23:37,750
What's happening to you?

367
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,453
How's dave doing?

368
00:23:53,617 --> 00:23:55,203
A few more possibles.

369
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:56,910
I'll take them.

370
00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:00,643
Hotch. Just got a walk-in.
His name's gil bonner.

371
00:24:00,807 --> 00:24:02,248
What's his story?

372
00:24:02,412 --> 00:24:05,370
It's about the unsub's
accident. He says it's his fault.

373
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,683
It was late,and i'd spent
all day in eugene with my mom.

374
00:24:11,847 --> 00:24:13,950
She'd been sick.

375
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,713
I shouldn't have been driving.

376
00:24:16,877 --> 00:24:19,893
But I just wanted to get
home to see my little girl.

377
00:24:20,057 --> 00:24:23,128
It was darker than usual.

378
00:24:23,292 --> 00:24:25,968
I remember the moon was just a sliver.

379
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:29,440
Right outside the cascades,my
phone started vibrating.

380
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:34,393
And when I went to reach for it,I
knocked it off the far side of the seat,

381
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:38,813
And it fell down by the
door,and I thought I could reach.

382
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,363
And you took your eyes off the road?

383
00:24:40,527 --> 00:24:42,478
If couldn't have been for
more than a few seconds.

384
00:24:42,642 --> 00:24:47,480
But when I looked back up,there were
lights and this horn was blaring.

385
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:51,260
And I swerved at the last
second,and then iust...

386
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:56,563
Kept on going... Without a scratch.

387
00:24:56,727 --> 00:24:59,460
You'd gone into the oncoming lane?

388
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,278
What happened to the other vehicle?

389
00:25:01,442 --> 00:25:05,653
Well,that's the thing. It was in
rearview mirror and then it was gone.

390
00:25:05,817 --> 00:25:07,028
It vanished.

391
00:25:07,192 --> 00:25:08,248
Why didn't you stop?

392
00:25:08,412 --> 00:25:09,618
It didn't seem real.

393
00:25:09,782 --> 00:25:13,128
You're saying you just
pretended it didn't happen?

394
00:25:13,292 --> 00:25:17,180
I guess if you tell yourself
something for long enough...

395
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:20,453
You can make anything true.

396
00:25:20,617 --> 00:25:23,473
Well,you're here now. Tell
us about thother vehicle.

397
00:25:23,637 --> 00:25:25,573
It was the truck you're looking for.

398
00:25:25,737 --> 00:25:27,098
How do you know that?

399
00:25:27,262 --> 00:25:29,630
When I saw the news...

400
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,870
It all made sense.

401
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:36,340
It's come back for revenge.

402
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:38,243
When did the accident occur?

403
00:25:38,407 --> 00:25:42,013
December '07. The second saturday.

404
00:25:42,177 --> 00:25:45,763
There are no accidents
reported in december of 2007.

405
00:25:45,927 --> 00:25:49,293
No. That's... No.

406
00:25:49,457 --> 00:25:51,673
Maybe you have your dates wrong?

407
00:25:51,837 --> 00:25:53,758
It could have been november.

408
00:25:53,922 --> 00:25:58,058
Uh,memories are kind of
like puzzle pieces,and it's--

409
00:25:58,222 --> 00:26:04,090
It's quite possible that in suppressing these
for so long,you've sort of rearranged things.

410
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,188
How long was your mother sick?

411
00:26:07,352 --> 00:26:10,710
5 months. She...

412
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,630
She died in january.

413
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:18,093
That much I know.

414
00:26:18,257 --> 00:26:19,803
He's ex-military,good with
his hands,repairs. - Ok,thanks.

415
00:26:19,967 --> 00:26:21,413
<i>{\a6}******</i>

416
00:26:21,577 --> 00:26:25,573
Look,even with that description,you're
talking about 5 years' worth of patients.

417
00:26:25,737 --> 00:26:30,328
What if we could narrow it down to a 5-month
window,between september '07 and january '08?

418
00:26:30,492 --> 00:26:32,273
What's this person done,exactly?

419
00:26:32,437 --> 00:26:34,203
Exactly? 3 murders.

420
00:26:34,367 --> 00:26:35,663
And he's not gonna stop there.

421
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:39,453
Murders? You do realize the
condition of our patients?

422
00:26:39,617 --> 00:26:42,270
A paraplegic can drive
with the right rigging.

423
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,490
Is this about
those hit-and-runs?

424
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,793
There's something you should see.

425
00:26:50,957 --> 00:26:53,933
He,uh,he left us about... 4 months ago.

426
00:26:54,097 --> 00:26:56,433
Didn't make the kind of
progress that we'd hoped for.

427
00:26:56,597 --> 00:26:57,598
Getting himself back in shape?

428
00:26:57,762 --> 00:26:59,843
No,physically,he--
he made great strides.

429
00:27:00,007 --> 00:27:02,048
It was emotional issues.

430
00:27:02,212 --> 00:27:04,033
Anger issues?

431
00:27:04,197 --> 00:27:05,943
Did he ever talk about getting even?

432
00:27:06,107 --> 00:27:08,000
You can look for yourself.

433
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,358
Ian coakley.

434
00:27:10,522 --> 00:27:12,538
We have the patients
write and draw daily.

435
00:27:12,702 --> 00:27:15,343
Small tasks to help
strengthen their hands.

436
00:27:15,507 --> 00:27:17,753
Ian spent most of his time on those.

437
00:27:17,917 --> 00:27:19,603
You had to know this guy was disturbed.

438
00:27:19,767 --> 00:27:22,133
It's part of healing.We
encourage this kind of--

439
00:27:22,297 --> 00:27:23,743
murder fantasy.

440
00:27:23,907 --> 00:27:26,533
Grief can take on disturbing forms.

441
00:27:26,697 --> 00:27:28,600
Red car.

442
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,763
They're all different,like
he couldn't decide.

443
00:27:30,927 --> 00:27:33,423
When his memory came
back,it was... Fluid.

444
00:27:33,587 --> 00:27:35,618
So it changed,like his targets.

445
00:27:35,782 --> 00:27:38,528
His mind was trying to find out
the truth about what had happened.

446
00:27:38,692 --> 00:27:39,878
We need the date of his accident.

447
00:27:40,042 --> 00:27:43,213
September 28,2007,ian
and sheila coakley crashed

448
00:27:43,377 --> 00:27:45,913
While driving home from napa valley going
eastbound on route 7 around midnight.

449
00:27:46,077 --> 00:27:49,913
It appeared their car was run off the
road,flipped numerous times,no witnesses.

450
00:27:50,077 --> 00:27:53,293
His wife was riding in the passenger
seat. She died at the scene.

451
00:27:53,457 --> 00:27:56,423
Coakley survived. Paramedics
indicated spinal cord injury.

452
00:27:56,587 --> 00:28:00,063
Morgan said he fractured
his t6 and t7 vertebrae.

453
00:28:00,227 --> 00:28:00,913
He's paraplegic.

454
00:28:01,077 --> 00:28:04,033
That's not all. He's a former light-wheel
mechanic in the army national guard.

455
00:28:04,197 --> 00:28:05,753
Does it say anything about a red car?

456
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:08,753
No. It says coakley suffered
memory loss after the accident.

457
00:28:08,917 --> 00:28:11,663
Short-term retrograde amnesia is
common after a serious accident.

458
00:28:11,827 --> 00:28:14,043
I think it's safe to
say he remembers now.

459
00:28:14,207 --> 00:28:16,213
Do we have an address?
- Yeah,garcia's working on that now.

460
00:28:16,377 --> 00:28:21,323
Ok. The house coakley and his wife bought was
foreclosed on 10 months after his accident.

461
00:28:21,487 --> 00:28:23,133
Well,there's gotta
be a paper trail,then.

462
00:28:23,297 --> 00:28:25,708
Yeah,and that trail leads
to a land called nowhere.

463
00:28:25,872 --> 00:28:30,568
Cashed some insurance checks during a stay
at edelman house,but after he left,zilch.

464
00:28:30,732 --> 00:28:32,183
Any relatives he could be staying with?

465
00:28:32,347 --> 00:28:34,683
No. I tried that. There's
no family in the area.

466
00:28:34,847 --> 00:28:39,753
My exquisitely educated guess is he's
either squatting or subletting with cash.

467
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:41,108
What about his truck?

468
00:28:41,272 --> 00:28:44,273
He owns a '79 dodge d100.

469
00:28:44,437 --> 00:28:45,758
He bought it used 10 years ago.

470
00:28:45,922 --> 00:28:47,613
He's had to rebuild
it several times now.

471
00:28:47,777 --> 00:28:50,108
Parts can't be easy to
find for a truck that old.

472
00:28:50,272 --> 00:28:52,823
I smell what you're cooking,agent.

473
00:28:52,987 --> 00:28:56,340
Checking auto suppliers in bend.

474
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:59,053
Yeah,rossi gets a fruit cup with lunch.

475
00:28:59,217 --> 00:29:01,913
He's having the parts
drop-shipped through syd's auto

476
00:29:02,077 --> 00:29:05,100
And sent directly to an
address in southwest bend.

477
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:17,650
Clear!

478
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:25,070
it's clear.

479
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:28,643
his truck is gone.

480
00:29:28,807 --> 00:29:30,208
We're all clear here.

481
00:29:30,372 --> 00:29:32,358
Get all your vehicles off
this street,set up a perimeter.

482
00:29:32,522 --> 00:29:34,283
If coakley comes back this
way,we want to be ready for him.

483
00:29:34,447 --> 00:29:36,123
Got it. Come on.

484
00:29:36,287 --> 00:29:39,760
Let's get to work.
- Rossi. Come on. You want to see this.

485
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:48,110
Look at the grilles.

486
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:50,640
They still got blood on them.

487
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:56,773
He's been switching plates.

488
00:29:56,937 --> 00:29:59,590
We should revise the bolo.

489
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:04,080
Hey,rossi,look at this.

490
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:06,530
Stalk central.

491
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,290
That right there's shannon makely.

492
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:15,500
Maria delgado jogging.

493
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,260
Victor costella. They're all here.

494
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:21,713
So who's this guy?

495
00:30:21,877 --> 00:30:25,123
You think it's possible there are
other victims we don't know about?

496
00:30:25,287 --> 00:30:27,203
I don't think so. Garcia
would have found them.

497
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:30,080
Then I think we've
found his next target.

498
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:35,590
Hey,baby girl. I need
you to run a plate fast.

499
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:47,030
Hey,garret.
- That's good.

500
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,583
Mrs. Burke? Fbi. We're
looking for your husband.

501
00:31:05,747 --> 00:31:07,900
Sorry,you just missed him.

502
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:09,683
What is this about?

503
00:31:09,847 --> 00:31:11,223
We think he may be in danger.

504
00:31:11,387 --> 00:31:12,583
Can you reach him on his cell?

505
00:31:12,747 --> 00:31:15,613
No. He's on a ride. He doesn't
take his phone with him.

506
00:31:15,777 --> 00:31:18,633
A bike ride? Yes. He's in a club.

507
00:31:18,797 --> 00:31:20,123
He's on the open road.

508
00:31:20,287 --> 00:31:22,273
Do they have a regular route?

509
00:31:22,437 --> 00:31:26,383
Um,saturdays-- uh,they do
the prineville reservoir loop.

510
00:31:26,547 --> 00:31:28,993
It's about a 50-mile
round trip from here.

511
00:31:29,157 --> 00:31:32,153
Please... What is going on?

512
00:31:32,317 --> 00:31:35,180
We need you to tell us
every road they take.

513
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,553
Hey,I thought you could use a hand.

514
00:31:39,717 --> 00:31:41,083
Oh,thank you. Have you
heard anything from hotch?

515
00:31:41,247 --> 00:31:42,833
<i>{\a6}HOME******</i>

516
00:31:42,997 --> 00:31:44,363
Uh,they think they've
located garret burke.

517
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:47,273
If they can bring him
in,coakley has nowhere to go.

518
00:31:47,437 --> 00:31:48,133
Well,he'll go somewhere.

519
00:31:48,297 --> 00:31:51,653
Hopefully,going through this stuff
will help us figure out where.

520
00:31:51,817 --> 00:31:54,168
All of his wife's things.

521
00:31:54,332 --> 00:31:55,373
He never unpacked them.

522
00:31:55,537 --> 00:31:57,898
He never unpacked
anything,as far as I can tell.

523
00:31:58,062 --> 00:32:01,450
What do you think this
means,living like this?

524
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,310
I think it means he's stuck.

525
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:27,213
Hotch,we're on route 26
heading toward the reservoir.

526
00:32:27,377 --> 00:32:30,403
I think we're about
halfway around the loop.

527
00:32:30,567 --> 00:32:31,763
So far no sign of him.

528
00:32:31,927 --> 00:32:33,393
Copy that. We're
heading southbound on 20.

529
00:32:33,557 --> 00:32:37,060
Hopefully we can hit route
26 before they fly by us.

530
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,263
Anything?
- 9/26/07.

531
00:32:46,427 --> 00:32:49,023
That was was 2 days before the crash?

532
00:32:49,187 --> 00:32:51,170
They were really happy.

533
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,900
Wait a second.

534
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:05,363
Hotch,you know how coakley was driving his
wife's car on the night of the accident?

535
00:33:05,527 --> 00:33:07,013
It was a red coupe.

536
00:33:07,177 --> 00:33:09,770
Are you sure?
- We have pictures.

537
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,013
What does it mean?

538
00:33:11,177 --> 00:33:13,483
Maybe there was no other car.
- What?

539
00:33:13,647 --> 00:33:17,533
Think about it. The make and model
of his target car keeps changing.

540
00:33:17,697 --> 00:33:19,073
Like he knows they aren't right.

541
00:33:19,237 --> 00:33:22,803
And his doctor at the rehab
facility called if fluid memory,

542
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:24,493
But what if it was more than that?

543
00:33:24,657 --> 00:33:26,843
So if it's a single-car accident...

544
00:33:27,007 --> 00:33:28,213
It was coakley's fault.

545
00:33:28,377 --> 00:33:31,783
He was driving back from napa valley
that night. That's a long drive.

546
00:33:31,947 --> 00:33:33,573
Fell asleep at the wheel.

547
00:33:33,737 --> 00:33:35,108
Wouldn't be the first time.

548
00:33:35,272 --> 00:33:39,303
The guilt of that would be overwhelming,the
truth almost impossible to take.

549
00:33:39,467 --> 00:33:40,898
So he's projecting blame.

550
00:33:41,062 --> 00:33:45,320
A red coupe did cause the
accident,and he was driving it.

551
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:42,910
Hold on!

552
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:02,640
Are you hurt?

553
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:09,090
Can you move?
- I'm ok. Go.

554
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:24,083
You can't blame other people
for what you've done,coakley.

555
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:26,413
Detective! Detective!

556
00:35:26,577 --> 00:35:28,133
You know the truth.

557
00:35:28,297 --> 00:35:30,143
No one else needs to die.

558
00:35:30,307 --> 00:35:31,663
It's not gonna help!

559
00:35:31,827 --> 00:35:34,550
There was no other red car,was there?

560
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:50,710
No. No.

561
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,660
Go! Go!

562
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,700
Where the hell is he going,rossi?

563
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,960
There's no outlet up
here. He's hemmed in.

564
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,020
No,don't do it,man.

565
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:45,830
I don't know about you,but I haven't had
my bell rung like that in a long time.

566
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,190
No,I'm good,thanks.

567
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:51,160
Impressive group you travel with.

568
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,173
They are.

569
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:57,020
You knew what I said to
coakley was gonna set him off.

570
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,693
Challenging a delusion like his
can have unpredictable consequences.

571
00:38:01,857 --> 00:38:04,330
Like driving off a cliff.

572
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:07,340
He made a choice.

573
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:12,240
Well,I'm not gonna lose any
sleep over it if it's ok with you.

574
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:20,650
Uh,i'll catch up with you.
- Ok.

575
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:23,580
Mr. Bonner.

576
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,393
I got a message that
you wanted to see me.

577
00:38:26,557 --> 00:38:29,483
Yes. Thanks for coming
in. I did so fact-checking.

578
00:38:29,647 --> 00:38:31,848
You said the moon was
just a sliver that night.

579
00:38:32,012 --> 00:38:35,490
The new moon was on november 10,2007.

580
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:38,553
What else did you find?

581
00:38:38,717 --> 00:38:44,770
A man named william madlock was run off the road
that night by a car that drifted into his lane.

582
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:50,103
No injuries?

583
00:38:50,267 --> 00:38:51,998
There was some damage to his car.

584
00:38:52,162 --> 00:38:55,513
And you'll be held responsible
for fleeing the scene.

585
00:38:55,677 --> 00:38:58,760
A volkswagen? But it was a truck.

586
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,630
Was it?

587
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:06,400
I think you've wanted to tell someone
about this for a very long time.

588
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:12,620
And this case,that truck,gave
you the excuse you needed.

589
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:17,020
Guilt's a powerfulhing.

590
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:20,750
You didn't hurt anyone,Mr. Bonner.

591
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:30,850
Thank you.

592
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:39,070
Garcia is...

593
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:45,020
Contemplating a life of
solitude and celibacy.

594
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:53,660
Did you get the job?
- No.

595
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,720
I'm sorry.

596
00:39:57,350 --> 00:39:59,103
Only a...

597
00:39:59,267 --> 00:40:02,553
Fool would hire somebody
over you for that job.

598
00:40:02,717 --> 00:40:05,590
Oh,no,they didn't hire
anybody. The position just...

599
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:09,023
Went away.
- Went away?

600
00:40:09,187 --> 00:40:11,443
Yeah. Apparently there
was a security breach.

601
00:40:11,607 --> 00:40:17,130
Someone hacked the project database,and
the whole project was put on hold.

602
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,043
All that over a little network hack.

603
00:40:20,207 --> 00:40:22,103
Well,you know,you can't be too
careful. You know how that goes.

604
00:40:22,267 --> 00:40:25,090
Right. Well...

605
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,970
It's probably blessing in disguise.

606
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:33,920
I mean... With your delicate stomach,you wouldn't
have been able to stand the food in karachi.

607
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:39,760
I never told you that it was in karachi.

608
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:43,630
Didn't you?

609
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:49,843
Ok. It's ok. I could not
have gone without you.

610
00:40:50,007 --> 00:40:52,693
And I couldn't have gone with you.

611
00:40:52,857 --> 00:40:56,210
This place is my home.
- I know.

612
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:15,173
"the human voice can never reach the distance that
is covered by the still,small voice of conscience."

613
00:41:15,337 --> 00:41:17,040
Mahatma gandhi.

614
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:20,040
Come on,daddy!

615
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:24,010
Let's go home!
