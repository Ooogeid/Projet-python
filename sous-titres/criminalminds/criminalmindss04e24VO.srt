1
00:00:00,401 --> 00:00:01,567
Ooh, is mommy
gonna get danny?

2
00:00:01,567 --> 00:00:02,734
Is mommy gonna get
danny?

3
00:00:02,734 --> 00:00:04,067
Mommy's gonna get danny!

4
00:00:04,067 --> 00:00:06,234
Oh, mommy's got danny!

5
00:00:06,234 --> 00:00:08,434
Mommy got danny!

6
00:00:08,434 --> 00:00:11,134
Mommy loves you. ohh...

7
00:00:11,134 --> 00:00:13,401
That was fun.

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,134
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

9
00:00:20,134 --> 00:00:21,167
He got it!

10
00:00:21,167 --> 00:00:22,368
Oh, man.
ha ha ha!

11
00:00:22,368 --> 00:00:23,368
Fooled you.

12
00:00:23,368 --> 00:00:24,900
Fooled you!

13
00:00:26,517 --> 00:00:29,118
Hey, abby, wait up.

14
00:00:33,417 --> 00:00:36,118
Hey, let's stop here.

15
00:00:36,118 --> 00:00:38,484
I like this view.

16
00:00:42,118 --> 00:00:44,383
Hey, watch it.

17
00:00:44,383 --> 00:00:46,584
Seriously?

18
00:01:17,084 --> 00:01:19,383
Mommy got danny!

19
00:01:21,617 --> 00:01:23,350
You ok, honey?

20
00:01:26,717 --> 00:01:30,317
I'm sorry, baby.
we must have caught
something today.

21
00:01:30,317 --> 00:01:31,517
You're burning up.

22
00:02:13,517 --> 00:02:15,484
Help me!

23
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,240
Case must be local. Jj said not to bring a go bag.

24
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:21,390
Morgan: what's the army doing here?

25
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,670
What the hell is going on?

26
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,670
Guys,this is dr. Linda kimura,

27
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,690
Chief of special pathogens with the cdc.

28
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:42,660
Hello.

29
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,740
Hello. I'm sorry to meet under these circumstances.

30
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,920
We need to get started. What circumstances?

31
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,780
Last night,25 people checked into emergency rooms

32
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,310
In and around annapolis.

33
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,730
They were all at the same park after 2 p.M. Yesterday.

34
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,530
Within 10 hours, the first victim died.

35
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,100
It's now just past 7 a.M. The ne day,we have 12 dead.

36
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,750
Lung failure and black lesions.

37
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:05,800
Anthrax?

38
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,210
Anthrax doesn't kill this fast.

39
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,360
This strain does.

40
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,540
What are we doing about potential mass tarts--

41
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,520
Airports,malls,trains?

42
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,790
There's a media blackout.

43
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,400
We're not telling the public?

44
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,740
We'd have a mass exodus.

45
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,130
The psychology of group panic

46
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,220
Would cause more deaths than this last attack.

47
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,640
Yeah,and if it does get outah,and if it do get out, oevewhdiis

48
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,240
If there is another attack,

49
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,120
E's no way we'll be able to keep it quiet.

50
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,930
Our best chance of protecting the public

51
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,970
Is by building a profile as quickly as we can.

52
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,240
What do we know about this strain?

53
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,130
The spores are weaponized, reduced to a respiral ideal

54
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,830
That attacks deep in the lungs.

55
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,720
Odorless and invisible.

56
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,640
A sophisticated strain. Only a scientist would know how to do that.

57
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,140
These lesions are doubling in size in a matter of hours.

58
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,180
It's not the lesions i'm worried about.

59
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,430
It's the lungs.

60
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,890
We don't know how to combat the toxins once they're inside.

61
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,680
And the reality is, we may lose them all.

62
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,900
The remaing survivors have been moved to a special wing

63
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,270
At walter reed hospital.

64
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,000
Our offices will become a small command center.

65
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,840
We'll be working with military scientists from fort detrick.

66
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,290
General whitworth is coming here?

67
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:13,340
He's in charge of site containment and spore analysis.

68
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,450
Determing what strain this is will help inform who's responsible.

69
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,690
My team is in charge of treating all victims.

70
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,320
Reid,go with dr. Kimura to the hospital.

71
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,410
Interview the victims. Morgan and prentiss,there's a hazmat team

72
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,190
That will accompany you to the crime scene.

73
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,400
There's cipro. Everybody needs to take it before we go.

74
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,710
We don't know if it'effective against this strain,

75
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,310
But it's something.

76
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,900
This is really happening?

77
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,370
We knew this could happen.

78
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,540
We've done our homework.

79
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,750
We've prepared for this. This is it.

80
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,390
Jin dan.

81
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,750
May you live 100 years.

00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,950
Reid: "it will become fine dust

85
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,520
"Over all the land of egypt,

86
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,390
"And will become boils breaking out

87
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,420
"With sores on man and beast

88

Through all the land of egypt

89
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,610
Exodus 9:9.

90
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,710
Do you have those files i've been looking for?

91
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,520
Did you see this memo from the director?

92
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,330
S and emails are being monitored.

93
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,650
Yeah,they're trying to protect the media blackout. Files?

94
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,310
Uh,yeah,right here.

95
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,080
Thanks. I want to see what kind of medical treatment

96
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,180
The victims received before i head to the hospital.

97
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,840
Why do you think the suspect in 2001

98
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,120
Stopped sending the letters?

99
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,790
I have no idea, but if he hadn't,

100
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,400
It would have been much worse.

101
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,560
The worst part was not knowing

102
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,890
When it was gonna be over.

103
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,970
Feeling safe opening mail again.

104
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:41,110
5 people died. Many more exposed and sickened,

105
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,300
Including a baby who was admitted to the hospital

106
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,700
After lesions appeared on his skin.

107
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,920
How did he contract it?

108
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,740
I have no idea. Must have come into close contact

109
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,330
With a tainted letter or crossed paths with the unsub himself.

110
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,290
How old was the baby?

111
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,410
7 months.

112
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:55,630
Did he survive?

113
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,840
I gotta run. Kimura's waiting.

114
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,570
I'll call you from the hospital.

115
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:18,410
Spence.

116
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,390
Did the baby survive?

117
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,230
Yeah,but,i mean, that was a curable strain.

118
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,950
This thing's entirely different.

119
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,530
Agent jareau.

120
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:17,510
Uh,call me when he gets through security. Thanks.

121
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:35,960
The general's here.

122
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,320
Is there bad blood with him?

123
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,870
He was very critical of the way

124
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,400
The '01 amerithrax investigation was handled.

125
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,080
Because of what happened with dr. Hatfill.

126
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,100
Among other things.

127
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,950
And this is the list of victims you asked for.

128
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,650
No high-Profile jobs.

129
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,100
No. Just ordinary people frolicking in the park.

130
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,220
Rossi: any word from the cia?

131
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,110
They said there are a few overseas terrorist groups

132
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,430
With funding and capability.

133
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,290
They're working international. We've got domestic.

134
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,470
We need to look at anyone who could profit from this.

135
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:02,490
People who have patents on anthrax vaccines.

136
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,460
Yes,sir. Garcia.

137
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,810
And add to your list

138
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,140
Anyone with access to weaponized spores.

139
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,920
Universities,scholars working in bioweapons research.

140
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,610
Employees of labs who keep germ collections.

141
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:12,580
Be back in a few.

142
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,570
Right in here,sir.

143
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,100
Thank you,agent jareau.

144
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,750
General.

145
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,950
Agent hotchner.

146
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,650
This is ssa david rossi.

147
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,750
My scientists are decoding the strain.

148
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,890
The additives used to strengthen the bacterial capsules

149
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:28,580
Do not exist at our research labs.

150
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,690
Are there any other labs using these substances?

151
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:31,440
No.

152
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,740
I'd like a list of all the scientists

153
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,220
In your anthrax program.

154
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,700
I just said we don't use those additives.

155
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,290
Sir,we can rule out your lab samples,but not your people.

156
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,220
Rossi: we're looking at someone who has the ability

157
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,660
To manipulate and weaponize anthrax.

158
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,780
Your scientists make that cut.

159
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,750
Now,we all know what happened

160
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,860
The last time your team looked into my people.

161
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:52,300
Sir,our team officially ruled out dr. Hatfill.

162
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,960
I'm sorry if justice didn't listen to us,

163
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,480
But the profile was accurate.

164
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,360
Well,i'm outranked by someone

165
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,680
Who believes in your profiles.

166
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,940
I'll get you your list. Lieutenant.

167
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,250
Hi,abby.

168
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,700
You feeling any better?

169
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:12,720
Ok.

170
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,300
This is agent reid from the fbi.

171
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,310
If you can, will you talk with him?

172
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:20,330
Abby,i'd like to try to do

173
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:22,830
A memory recall exercise with you

174
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,970
To take you back to the park,if that's ok.

175
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,420
Yesterday afternoon,you rode your bicycle to the park.

176
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,360
How did the sun feel on your skin,

177
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,440
The breeze through your hair?

178
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,150
And the people that you saw?

179
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:46,110
It was warm,windy.

180
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,810
There were guys...football.

181
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,300
Kids...

182
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,370
I see free...

183
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,430
Me seen fee me.

184
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,580
Free knee.

185
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,330
S...sin knee.

186
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,370
All right,abby.

187
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:14,570
That's ok. You just rest now,ok?

188
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,180
Me mock fee key me free.

189
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,300
Shh,shh,shh. You just rest.

190
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,910
Ok? Thank you.

191
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,430
What's causing her aphasia?

192
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,460
The poison is infecting the parietal lobe,

193
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,710
Impairing her speech.

194
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,820
Some of the other patients displayed the same symptoms

195
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,270
Shortly before they died.

196
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:42,000
None of the drug combinations are working?

197
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,610
The only thing that's helping them right now is the morphine.

198
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,120
What are you telling people about why the park is closed?

199
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,890
Methane buildup in the sewage system.

200
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:00,190
And they believe it?

201
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,520
Oh,well,yeah,of course,why wouldn't they?

202
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,800
Hot zone and all surrounding areas have been neutralized.

203
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,730
You're safe here.

204
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,410
Huh. Are you sure?

205
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,750
Yes,ma'am.

206
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,410
Thank you.

207
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,560
Ok,check it out.

208
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,880
High levels tested over there.

209
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,460
That's probably where the unsub released the attack.

210
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,040
And there was a prevailing wind out of the northeast yesterday.

211
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,110
Airborne spores scattered that way,

212
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,630
Hitting everyone below it.

213
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:29,510
This park doesn't scream "target" to me.

214
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,390
Terrorists usually taworld trade center.

215
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:34,780
I mean,it's a nice park,but it's not a symbol.

216
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,290
Ok,so,maybe it's symbolic for the unsub.

217
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,310
Well,we know kaczynski sent bombs to berkeley where he taught,

218
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,620
Michigan where he went to school,and chicago where he lived.

219
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:47,430
And the amerithrax suspect sent letters to 2 pro-Choice senators

220
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,300
Whose politics he opposed.

221
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,820
They can't help attaching a personal motive

222
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:50,940
To the places they've targeted.

223
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:55,180
Ok. So,what does this place mean to our unsub?

224
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,900
[Flatline tone]

225
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,460
38-Year-Old high school history teacher.

226
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,180
Leaves 2 kids behind.

227
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,010
17 out of 25 dead.

228
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,920
This strain is duplicating

229
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,880
Every 30 to 45 minutes.

230
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,390
It's poisoning the lungs,

231
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,690
Causing massive hemorrhaging and organ failure.

232
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:24,230
Extreme bacterial amplification.

233
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,250
Whoever created this had to at some point

234
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,840
Go to the trouble of testing it.

235
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:28,940
What do you mean?

236
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,440
Think about the way scientists work their way up to human testing.

237
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,060
They start with rodents,then advance to larger mammals,

238
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,750
And then at some point,they do a very small trial run with people.

239
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,990
There's no way this was his first human test run.

240
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,550
We would have heard about a previous anthrax attack.

241
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:44,040
Not if it presented itself as something else.

242
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,620
The general's briefing a congressional committee,

243
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,130
And the director's meeting with the president

244
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,640
In an hour and wants our input.

245
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,710
I don't know how to do this.

246
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,870
I can't stop thinking about henry.

247
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:04,310
He goes for a walk almost every single day

248
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,860
At potomac park.

249
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,050
What type of mother am i if i don't at least call

250
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:09,470
And tell him to stay at home?

251
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,650
Jj,we can't.

252
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:13,020
I know,but...

253
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,620
How do i not?

254
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,990
I understand that you want to protect your son.

255
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,660
But if we all called home and used this information

256
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,290
To give us an advantage that other people don't have...

257
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,190
Is that the right thing to do?

258
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,190
We need to call reid.

259
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:32,600
He said this may not be the first attack.

260
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,660
[Line ringing]

261
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,060
Hello?

262
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,340
Uh,reid,you have me,rossi,and hotch.

263
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,990
Kimura made some calls. It turns out

264
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:42,100
That 2 days ago,2 people in 2 separate baltimore e.R.S

265
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,060
And one person in a philadelphia e.R.

266
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,920
Slipped into comas and died suddenly.

267
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,080
Now,the c.O.D. On all of them was meningitis.

268
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,750
Doctors didn't test for anthrax

269
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,550
Because the illnesses presented themselves as meningitis,

270
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,330
But i think it can be caused by anthrax.

271
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:56,610
Did they show symptoms that we're seeing now-- The lesions?

272
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,350
They wouldn't have if the bodily functions expired as quick did.

273
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,080
How quickly?

274
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,650
All dead within 3 hours of being admitted.

275
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,810
But the first patient died yesterday at 10 hours.

276
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:07,110
Here's the thing-- If ter concentration of the strain,

277
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,250
It would cause a quicker death.

278
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,750
Organ failure without exterior physical symptoms.

279
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,820
What are their names?

280
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:15,770
Gale mercer,31,martha finestein,48,

281
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:17,910
Albert franks,52.

282
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:18,580
What next?

283
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,450
See if they visited the same place on may 8th.

284
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,610
Gale mercer made a credit card purchase

285
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,260
At the book front,owned by albert franks.

286
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,500
We need to find general whitworth.

287
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,200
He needs to sent a team out there.

288
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,260
Mm-Hmm.

289
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,630
[Beeping]

290
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,390
All right,jj,i got it. Thanks.

291
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,870
Look at all these people just going about their lives.

292
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,320
If they only knew what we were doing here.

293
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,660
Better that they don't.

294
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:56,120
Jj says the store's been closed since the owner died.

295
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,540
Gale mercer's credit card purchase happened right before closing.

296
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,880
Well,that explains why only 3 people were hit.

297
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,190
We tested hot.

298
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,420
I'll alert command.

299
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,900
This was his test run.

300
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,230
He's gotta have a history with the place.

301
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,870
We need to get a list of current and past employees,

302
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,570
Customers with grievances against the owner,

303
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,230
See if any one of them had a science background.

304
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:21,850
Can you believe there is only a quarter-Inch-Thick

305
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:24,780
Pane of glass between all of us and a wmd?

306
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,490
Attack anthrax wasn't made to kill 3 people inside a bookstore.

307
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:29,220
It wants to be right out here in the open,

308
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,990
Where it can feed and multiply.

309
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:35,010
Just a small amount could wipe out everyone here.

310
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,080
And they'd never see it coming.

311
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:42,760
It feels like the plagues of egypt.

312
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,960
10 scourges created by god.

313
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,720
Plague 6 was unhealable boils

314
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,670
Believed by biblical scholars to be caused by anthrax.

315
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,150
Never missed sunday school,did you?

316
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,360
Actually,never been before.

317
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,470
How is she doing?

318
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:54,740
She's a fighter.

319
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,680
She's held on this long because she's young and strong.

320
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,980
But she's started to bleed into her lungs.

321
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,630
One of 4 left.

322
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,180
We're running into another problem.

323
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,030
When the next of kin have questions,

324
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,730
What do we tell them about cause of death?

325
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,190
Yes,sir.

326
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:14,270
We'll do what we can in the time we've got.

327
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:15,930
Thank you.

328
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,990
There are problems containing the story.

329
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:19,720
What happened?

330
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,250
I don't know,but the president may have to make an announcement tonight.

331
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,520
What did you hear from the bookstore?

332
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,750
Ran names of former employees,customers with grievances.

333
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,890
No one with the science background we're looking for.

334
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:30,070
Garcia's still digging.

335
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,120
Do we have everyone we need for the profile?

336
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,320
Oh,yeah. Entire defense community is here.

337
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,210
Never seen so many alpha males in one room.

338
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,020
Let's get started.

339
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:43,060
Hotch: because the locations hit

340
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,580
Are not symbolically significant,

341
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,660
We believe that these attacks are personal.

342
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,060
Prentiss: understanding the significance

343
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,650
Of these locations will be the key

344
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:50,940
To identifying him.

345
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,670
This personal element strongly indicates

346
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,550
A home-Grown terrorist.

347
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,150
Morgan: like the amerithrax case,we believe

348
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:59,550
This is someone from the science or defense community.

349
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,870
That's why you're here.

350
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,750
We think you may know him.

351
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,980
He may be one of us.

352
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,100
These home-Grown terrorists are myopic zealots,

353
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,380
Ideologues that believe that their work

354
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,040
Is of the greatest importance.

355
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,680
He may have preached about the threat

356
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,360
Of an attack on america.

357
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,060
His coworkers would describe him

358
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,270
As histrionic,

359
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,430
Paranoid,

360
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,400
Secretive.

361
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,350
All due respect,that's a little vague.

362
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,630
What are we supposed to do with something that generic?

363
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:24,970
Sir,we're not finished yet.

364
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:27,020
He may have logged excess hours at work

365

In the past weeks preparing for the attack.

366
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,670
We believe he's taken the full dosage of anthrax vaccines

367
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,550
Over the recommended 18-Month schedule

368
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,190
And had yearly boosters.

Where he makes his product in privacy.

371
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,920
He also has access to large,expensive,

373
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,940
Rossi: he's written about the threats of anthrax attacks,

374
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,440
Published papers.

375
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,410
Yet he feels no one is listening.

376
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:50,860
And that angers him.

377
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,380
Morgan: now,he may have recently experienced

378
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,570
Some sort of professional humiliation,

379
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:56,500
Like be demoted or fired.

380
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,050
Now,that would have been his trigger,

381
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,150
The moment he decided to go rogue.

382
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,240
And he may have betrayed his loved ones to his cause.

383
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,320
He may be recently separated or divorced.

This is somebody who knows every detail

Of the 2001 anthrax attack

386
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:10,720
And has talked about what that suspect did

387
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,940
Right or wrong.

388
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,820
He's watching the news very closely

389
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,880
To see how the country reacts.

390
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,180
Please share this with your departments. Thank you.

[Overlapping chatter]

There's something i think you should see.

On defense and homeland security.

395
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:36,540
Dr. Lawrence nichols. He used to work at the institute.

396
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,660
He left in '02.

397
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,140
He didn't leave. He was forced out.

398
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,020
5 people died.

399
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,940
If you ask me,we're lucky it was just 5.

400
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,770
We're lucky that whoever sent these letters

Are capable of wiping out entire cities.

405
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:58,560
And we are woefully unprepared.

406
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,870
I'm looking at your proposal.

407
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,780
Yes,sir. Every household needs gas masks

408
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,480
And a 2-Month supply of cipro for each resident.

409
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,260
Every major city needs hospitals

410
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,350
With bio-Safety decontamination capabilities.

411
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,910
Regarding the budget you propose for this operation--

412
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:16,360
Anything short of 50 billion would be grossly negligent.

413
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,920
Dr. Nichols,you've got to realize how unrealistic that is.

414
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,800
Unrealistic?

415
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,620
We can't justify spending that kind of money

416
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,100
On an attack that may not happen.

417
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,690
You people are in denial!

Senator: doing this would incite fear

419
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,730
And panic among the public.

420
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:30,620
This country should be panicked!

421
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,570
We should live in utter fear of being attacked!

422
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:33,990
Dr. Nichols,please sit down.

423
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,390
I will not sit down.

To our lack of preparedness,

428
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:46,380

Which is why they removed him from fort detrick.

And railroaded from other prominent positions.

00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,430
There's a smaller desk.

542
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,670
Two different work spaces?

543
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,440
Two sets of handwriting.

544
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,680
I'm looking at instructions on how to boil lab-Grade broth,

545
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,910
Sterilize lab equipment,and transfer spores.

546
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,310
Nichols would know all that.

547
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:35,050
He has a partner,maybe even a protege.

548
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:37,230
Go back to the b.A.U.,try to figure out who this partner is.

549
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:38,810
Hotch,why don't you go? I'll stay with reid.

550
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,700
Funnel all the information you get to me.

551
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,070
Hotch says nichols may have had a protege who turned on him.

552
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,440
I think we should tell the supervisor

553
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,830
That this is about anthrax.

554
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,150
That's not our call to make.

555
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:56,410
Screw protocol. Reid's in trouble.

556
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:58,430
If we tell this guy the truth,he might be able to help us.

557
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,960
Look,i want to help reid,too.

558
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,060
But our job is to do the best we can within our boundaries.

559
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,780
Who's dr. Nichols close to here?

560
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,650
Oh,no one,really.

561
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,490
He worked on his projects alone.

562
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:10,750
Is he ok?

563
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,250
Does he mentor anyone?

564
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:13,840
Not that i know of.

565
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,580
Did he ever work on anything other than the flu here?

566
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,640
No. Why?

567
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:21,730
Did he ever have samples of anything he shouldn't have had?

568
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,480
Look,i really need to know what this is about

569
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,620
Before i answer any more questions.

570
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,030
We'll get back to you.

571
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,660
[Ring]

572
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,480
Jj,on voicemail: hi,we're not home right now.

573
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,990
Please leave a message.

574
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:14,130
[Beep]

575
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,400
Uh,hey. It's--It's me.

576
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,850
Just calling to...

577
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,890
See where you are.

578
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,090
Um...give me a call. Ok?

579
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:54,200
Love you.

580
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,900
[Telephone rings]

581
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:04,160
Hey,reid.

582
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,130
Gee,wow,no,uh...

583
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,890
No witty garcia greeting for me?

584
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:11,040
[Sighs] i can't be my sparkly self

585
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,160
When you are where you are.

586
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:15,590
Garcia,do you think you can do something for me?

587
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,410
Anything.

588
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:17,400
I,uh...

589
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:20,460
I know i can't call my mom

590
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,930
Without,uh--[Clears throat]--

591
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,510
Without alerting everyone at her hospital.

592
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:27,870
What do you need?

593
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:28,770
I,uh...

594
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:31,760
I need you to record a message for her

595
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,800
In case anything happens to me.

596
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,310
Oh,nothing's going to happen to you.

597
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:38,290
You're gonna...brilliantly find out who did this

598
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:39,900
And we're gonna treat this strain.

599
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,770
[Exhales] i hope you're right,

600
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:44,470
But if you're not,i just-- I really want to make sure

601
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,430
That she hears my voice.

602
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,740
Ok. Just,uh,give me a second.

603
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,770
Are you ready?

604
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,130
Ready.

605
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:58,810
Hi,mom. This is spencer.

606
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:00,000
I just,um...[sighs]

607
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,650
I just...really want you to know

608
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:05,390
That i love you

609
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,160
And--[Voice catches,clears throat]

610
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:15,030
I need you to know that i spend every day of my life

611
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:17,950
Proud to be your son.

612
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,720
Reid?

613
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,390
Dr. Kimura: prep the victim for transfer.

614
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:26,350
I gotta go.

615
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,140
Dr. Reid.

616
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,100
You look nice.

617
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,340
[Laughs] i haven't been in this outfit for a while.

618
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:38,960
How are--How are the patients doing?

619
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,080
Let's worry about you.

620
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,710
I actually--I feel fine.

621
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:43,690
Ok,if you feel any pain,i could give you something.

622
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:46,280
No,i--I'd rather not take any pain medication.

623
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,820
We can at least make you feel more comfortable.

624
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,000
I am comfortable and i don't want to take any narcotics.

625
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,160
Ok.

626
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,680
Tell me how i can help.

627
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,830
I think the cure for this strain

628
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,060
Is in here somewhere.

629
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,460
Well,shall i start here?

630
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,440
Dr. Nichols is a former military scientist,

631
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,890
Which means he's most likely secretive

632
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:03,180
And most likely a little paranoid.

633
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,940
He would have protected the cure

634
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:07,430
And probably would have hidden it from his partners.

635
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,990
So look for something innocuous,

636
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:39,700
Something you would not suspect.

637
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:10,940
All right. [Cell phone rings]

638
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:12,740
[Coughs] hello.

639
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,340
How's it going in there,kid?

640
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,700
I've seen better days.

641
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,200
Well,you got me and garcia.

642
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,360
Hey,reid.

643
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:51,230
[Coughing]

644
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,360
Morgan: reid,stick with me.

645
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:27,210
Listen,prentiss and rossi don't think the partner was a coworker.

646
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:28,710
Can you tell us anything else about him?

647
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:31,030
I...i've already been through everything.

648
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,600
Come on,now,kid,i know you're not thinking straight,

649
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,050
But the reid i know wouldn't stop looking.

650
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:37,920
All right,all right.

651
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:08,760
[Clears throat]

652
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:41,390
I see a,uh,a framed photograph

653
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:43,120
Of dr. Nichols teaching.

654
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,480
I see a...

655
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,220
I see a binder with syllabi.

656
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,960
Course assignments

657
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:52,030
Going all the way back to the 1970s.

658
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:54,110
All right. So he kept a scrapbook of himself as a professor.

659
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:56,490
That tells us that he values himself as an educator.

660
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,190
A teacher.

661
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,660
I saw something earlier. I didn't--

662
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:04,500
I didn't make a connection to it or to the partner,

663
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,850
But he has a study on anthrax.

664
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:09,920
He has an annotated bibliography,table of contents.

665
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,390
It's formatted like a thesis

666
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,040
And has writing in the margins in red ink,

667
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,050
Like the way a teacher grades a paper.

668
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:17,260
Now,nichols wouldn't have let just anyone in here,

669
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,380
But he may have opened his lab

670
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,940
For educational purposes,as a teacher.

671
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,040
So the partner must have appealed to him as a student.

672
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,950
Nichols is helping him with his thesis.

673
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:28,140
I--I can look up local ph.D. Students.

674
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,310
Morgan: yeah,check the sciences.

675
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:31,580
Biochemistry,microbiology.

676
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,130
Uh...

677
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,080
Cross-Checking with names

678
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,040
Of former employees or customers with grievances

679
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,800
At the bookstore.

680
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:11,130
[Beeping]

681
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,830
Nothing,my doves.

682
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:44,280
Reid,coughing: listen to this.

683
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,990
"This country is woefully unprepared.

684
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:49,470
"Every household should have a 2-Month supply of cipro.

685
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:52,910
Hospitals are in need of bio-Safety level 4 decon wings."

686
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:55,210
That's verbatim to what we heard from nichols.

687
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,790
The partner's adopted nichols' views as his own.

688
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:01,700
The chapters are on setting up triage

689
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,680
And mobile emergency rooms.

690
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,820
I don't think this paper was written by a science student.

691
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,450
It's about city preparedness and response.

692
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:09,800
So,garcia,check with students in the social studies--

693
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,310
Public policy,urban planning.

694
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:15,320
Hot to trot. There's a chad brown,

695
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,050
School of public policy at u. Of. M.

696
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:19,850
Matches a chad brown,former employee at the book front.

697
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:20,940
That's gotta be him.

698
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,860
Totally. He's been in the doctoral program on and off for 5 years.

699
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,400
Nix on a steady job.

700
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,610
Was slapped with a restraining order from his former girlfriend

701
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,400
And has been arrested and released twice

702
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,130
At protest rallies in d.C. I'll tell hotch.

703
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:34,700
Kid,you did real good.

704
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,000
Now get the hell out of there.

705
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,960
Bye. [Coughs]

706
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,980
Dr. Reid.

707
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,810
You said the cure would be hidden somewhere

708
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:40,460
We wouldn't suspect.

709
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,970
What about nichols' inhaler?

710
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,590
Chad brown applied for a civilian position

711
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,370
At fort detrick 4 different times.

712
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:48,850
His employment application.

713
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,870
He never got past the psych evals.

714
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:54,460
"Is it appropriate to sacrifice the lives of the few to save the many?"

715
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,810
He answered yes.

716
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:57,820
Every time. Why he never got hired.

717
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,610
Well,if he couldn't get into fort detrick,

718
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:01,580
Then being close to nichols was the next best thing.

719
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,520
We talked to his thesis adviser. In his proposal

720
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,420
He was gonna write about the ease of making homemade anthrax.

721
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,970
And interviewed dr. Nichols just to prove his point.

722
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:10,530
Get the address to prentiss and rossi.

723
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:11,210
Yes,sir.

724
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,480
Morgan: ok.

725
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,400
[Coughs]

726
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,840
Yeah,they're hosing him down now.

727
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,110
All right.

728
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,600
They're checking out brown's house.

729
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,730
Go help hotch.

730
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:23,000
Hotch has plenty of people helping him.

731
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,120
He needs you more than i do.

732
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,870
Reid,i'm gonna see you off to the hospital.

733
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:28,860
I'm about to get naked so they can scrub me down.

734
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,690
Is that something you really want to see?

735
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,310
I'll check on you later.

736
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:35,300
Take good care of him,please.

737
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,280
Get this to the lab.

738
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:40,890
I hope you're right about this.

739
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:41,890
So do i.

740
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:44,700
Dr. Reid,did you cut yourself?

741
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,770
Let's go.

742
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:58,620
Excuse me!

743
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,650
What's going on?

744
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,250
Why is he in that suit?

745
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:03,880
Ma'am,please stay back.

746
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:06,230
My kids are home. Do i need to get them out of here?

747
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,190
It's pretty bad.

748
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:11,140
Emily.

749
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:14,530
The house is infested with toxic mold.

750
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:17,030
And they can't start taking down the walls without protection.

751
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,810
But there's no danger to you.

752
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:19,990
Are you sure?

753
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,240
Yes,ma'am,i'm sure.

754
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,590
Ok.

755
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,340
Don't emily me.

756
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,060
[Siren]

757
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:04,030
[Coughing]

758
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:34,930
How are you feeling,dr. Reid?

759
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,010
My throat's a little dry.

760
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,580
But other than that,i feel...

761
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:41,810
Flee...

762
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:43,720
Feel fin.

763
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:47,350
I feel--I fleel fin. I--

764
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,650
Dr. Reid,ok.

765
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,390
Driver,faster.

766
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,900
[Coughing]

767
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:54,630
I've got a home lab in a shed in the back.

768
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:56,630
It's being secured as we speak.

769
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:57,390
And in here?

770
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:58,500
The house is totally clean,

771
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,080
But there's something in here you should see.

772
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,980
I found a white powdery substance here and here.

773
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,720
I performed an instant field test.

774
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,060
It's not anthrax.

775
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:10,610
It looks like he might be testing his dispersal device.

776
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:15,570
Rossi.

777
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,240
He's using light bulbs to carry spores.

778
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,690
He throws them on the ground-- Anthrax bombs.

779
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,170
And i know where he's going with them.

780
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,510
Derek. Dr. Kimura called.

781
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,550
Reid's in trouble.

782
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,490
What do you mean?

783
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:01,050
He got way sicker on the way to the hospital.

784
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:02,360
He's in respiratory distress.

785
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,160
Listen,he's with the people who can help him the most.

786
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,830
I need everybody's head here right now.

787
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,760
Ok,so,uh,we spoke to brown's sister.

788
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,210
They've been estranged for years.

789
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:11,120
Did she say anything about the park or the bookstore?

790
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,350
Quiet hills park was where he proposed to a girl. She said no.

791
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:16,750
The bookstore's where he worked to put himself through college.

792
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,550
I guess he's bitter about not being promoted.

793
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:20,920
So both locations represent rejection to him.

794
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,950
So what's our next move?

795
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:24,540
Prentiss and rossi found maps of transit systems at his house.

796
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,340
Here we go.

797
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,890
Dr. Nichols wrote a classified study

798
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:29,370
Commissioned by the u.S. Senate.

799
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:31,220
It simulated a mock anthrax attack

800
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,090
On the d.C. Train systems.

801
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:35,350
Now,he emphasized the main line--The red line--

802
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:37,050
As most vulnerable to an attack.

803
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:38,500
Forceful tunnel winds,

804
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,860
Biggest crowds,

805
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,330
Highest mortality risk.

806
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:43,820
Now,i deployed teams to every stop on the red line.

807
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,130
I don't think he's targeting the red line.

808
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:47,080
But you said he adopted all of nichols' ideas.

809
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,510
Wouldn't he want to prove this theory?

810
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:51,190
We also said that he chooses locations that are personal to him,

811
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:52,960
Ones that represent rejection.

812
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,920
What is the one place that's rejected him over and over again?

813
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,920
Fort detrick.

814
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,530
It'd be impossible for him to get in.

815
00:33:58,530 --> 00:33:59,880
He wouldn't have to attack the fort.

816
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,130
He could go after the people that work there

817
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:02,410
Or on their commute.

818
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:03,520
The closest station

819
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,360
To the marc train is frederick.

820
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,980
Get on the line to maryland transit.

821
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,170
But the study said the red line.

822
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:10,980
The profile says he's going to frederick.

823
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,230
That's where i'm going,and i could really use your help.

824

[Indistinct p.A. Announcements]

825
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,180
No gas masks. Repeat,no gas masks.

826
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:32,900
Rush hour crowd sees anyone in a mask,there's gonna be a stampede.

827
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:36,090
Morgan,i want you to stay aboveground and help the crowds. I'm gonna go down by myself.

828
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:37,210
Not a chance,hotch.

829
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:39,690
Morgan,we're a man down. If the area's infected,

830
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:41,660
We can't risk losing both of us as well.

831
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:44,870
We are a team. We're gonna go down as a team.

832
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:53,890
Hey,lisa.

833
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,210
Hey. I haven't seen you all day.

834
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:57,530
Locked up in level 3.

835
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:58,240
How did it go?

836
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,810
It's pretty fascinating stuff.

837
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:08,990
Seal the exits and clear the station.

838

[Train horn blows]

839
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,520
I've got it. Clear the train.

840
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:37,570

00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:06,210
Call your director. Order from the president.

854
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:08,480
The u.S. Army is taking this man into custody.

855

General,the army has no authority here.

856

We do now.

He helped create this strain.

858
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:16,550
He's the only one who can show us how it was made.

859

862
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,280

You were effective.

884
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,640
I can't believe it worked.

885
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,240

Especially by someone from fort detrick.

887
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:25,820

Do you think people would be better off

00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:05,000
Knowing everything we've prevented since 911?

899
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:09,510
Would it make them feel safer or more vulnerable?

900
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,980
You did the right thing.

901
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,880
Yeah,i know that.

902
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:17,250
I know it wouldn't have helped anything

903
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:19,220
If that woman knew what was happening across the street

904
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:21,030
From her and her kids.

905
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:24,050
I lied because it was my job,

906
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,390
And i wanted to protect her.

907
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:28,320
So what's eating at you,then?

908
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,230
Uh...

909
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:39,970
Am i naive to wish that lying is never the right thing to do?

910
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,610
With this job...

911
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:43,530
Yeah.

912
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:47,060
Sometimes,our job sucks.

913
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:48,530
Yeah.

914
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:56,410
And yet,next time i probably won't hesitate to lie again.

915
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:01,340
We got a lot of things to take with us to the grave.

916
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:05,420
Oh,so he ate the peas,too?

917
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,830
[Laughs]

918
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,350
Yeah,he is a good eater.

919
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:12,800
You're gonna keep him up for me,right?

920
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,140
Good.

921
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:17,450
I just really need to spend some time with him.

922
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,430
[Takes deep breath]

923
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,590
I missed him today.

924
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:23,080
Yeah.

925
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:28,360
Hey,it's me.

926
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,750
I know it's late,but,uh,is jack still awake?

927
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,900
Do you mind if i speak to him?

928
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,220
Thanks.

929
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:43,510
Hey,buddy.

930
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,200
What are you doing up so late?

931
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:51,520
Oh,yeah?

932
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:54,330
Right.

933
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,610
You're eating jell-O?

934
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:37,260
Hmm.

935
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:06,920
Hey,kid.

936
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:10,190
Hey,doc. Look who's back.

937
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,990
Is there any more jell-O?

938
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,500
Hey.

939
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:14,930
Not so fast.

940
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:16,850
What happened?

941
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:18,340
You're gonna be all right,kid.

942
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,740
And we got brown.

943
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,080
It's over.

944
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:22,570
How's abby?

945
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:24,000
She's on the mend.

946
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,660
So are the 3 others.

947
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:28,010
You were right about where to look for his cure.

948
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,490
Why was dr. Nichols making anthrax in the first place?

949
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:38,270
He was a brain scientist downgraded to working on the flu.

950
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,940
Brown comes along asking for help on his thesis...

951
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:43,010
Would have been more than happy to share his knowledge.

952
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:45,840
There was no indication that nichols had any idea what brown was planning.

953
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,630
His strain and its cure

954
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:51,210
Are getting locked up in containment at fort detrick,

955
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:54,350
With all the other bio-Agents people don't know about.

956
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:55,890
Morgan: hmm. Really.

957
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:58,390
What else do they have locked up in there?

958
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:06,060
Reid: "security is mostly a superstition.

959
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,320
"It does not exist in nature,

960
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:12,240
Nor do the children of men as a whole experience it."

961
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,830
Helen keller.
