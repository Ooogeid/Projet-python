00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:04,550
This is a special report from
la plata county, colorado.

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,960
We're reminded of jim
mckay's words from munich--

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:10,060
Our greatest hopes and our
worst fears are seldom realized.

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:13,490
Let's hope it's not the latter as we wait
to hear the fate of the women, children,

5
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,080
And f.b.i.agents inside the building.

6
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,520
Jim, are you getting this?

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,280
{\a6}<i>3 days earlier...</i>

8
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,000
{\a6}<i>POSTED NO TRESPASSING KEEP OUT</i>

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,350
He comes into my
bedroom and lays with me.

10
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,910
He says it's god's will.

11
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,610
I'm only 15.

12
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:34,730
And i'm not the only
one. Please help me!

13
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,730
{\a6}<i>La Plata County COLORADO</i>

14
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,280
Tell us about
the 9-1-1 call.

15
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,290
I believe the he that they referred to
is the church's leader, benjamin cyrus.

16
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,740
Benjamin cyrus--
no criminal record.

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,110
No record at all, really.

18
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:46,420
What else do you know about him?

19
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,650
It's rumored that he's practicing
polygamy and forced marriages.

20
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,150
Any idea who the caller is?

21
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,180
Uh, jessica evanson is the
one who the age fits, but...

22
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,040
We can't be sure.

23
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,240
So i negotiated interviews
with all the children.

24
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,320
It wasn't easy.

25
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,450
Well, considering
their view on outsiders,

26
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,680
It would be best if you
didn't identify us as f.b.i.

27
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,770
just use our real names,

28
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:09,250
And introduce us as child
victim interview experts.

29
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:37,300
I'm looking for mr. Benjamin cyrus.

30
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:39,180
You found him.

31
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:40,980
I'm nancy lunde.

32
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,900
We spoke on the phone
regarding the allegation.

33
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,120
Savages, the call us.

34
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,470
'Cause our manners differ from theirs.

35
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,970
We didn't come here to hear
you cite scripture, mr. Cyrus.

36
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,290
Actually, it's benjamin franklin.

37
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,530
Emily prentiss, spencer reid.

38
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,640
They're child victim interview experts.

39
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:02,650
How far from god's word must we
have strayed for there to be the need

40
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:07,500
to invent a job called child
victim interview expert?

41
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,220
We wish we didn't have to be here.

42
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,670
So do we.

43
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,320
But you are welcome, nonetheless.

44
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,050
The children are in the
school as i indicated.

45
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,700
Thank you.

46
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,630
You're using solar power?

47
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,200
Yeah. We're completely self-sufficient--
electricity, food, water.

48
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,430
Ben franklin said, god helps
those that helps themselves.

49
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,340
You look surprised.

50
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,950
No... Impressed, actually.

51
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,540
Thank you.

52
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:33,680
For what?

53
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,050
For admitting that.

54
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,120
We go to school. We do our chores.

55
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:45,190
And we treat ourselves and each
other with the respect god demands.

56
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,730
But you've never been off of the ranch?

57
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,690
I brought jessie here when she was 2.

58
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,980
You've talked to lots
of children in your work.

59
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,630
Tell me their lives
somehow better than ours?

60
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,410
We devote ourselves to god.

61
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,980
That doesn't mean we're
not devoted to our children.

62
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:02,020
We are not here because
of your religious beliefs.

63
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,660
Why are you here?

64
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,230
We received a phone call alleging that
an adult male member of your church

65
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,210
was having inappropriate relations
with the younger women here.

66
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,980
You're talking about cyrus.

67
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,450
- What makes you say that?
- Jessie, come on.

68
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:21,460
Is it inappropriate for a husband
to share a bed with his wife?

69
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,080
You are married to cyrus?

70
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,900
Yes. Cyrus is my husband and a prophet.

71
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,770
It's an honor to bare his children.

72
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,010
Jessica, you're 15 years old.

73
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:36,820
The state of colorado
requires parental consent.

74
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,540
She gave consent.

75
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,430
Get up! Get up!

76
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,770
You heard him!

77
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,330
Stand!

78
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,140
What's going on?

79
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:49,080
We just got a very strange
phone call from a news reporter.

80
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:52,930
Is there anything you want
to tell me about a raid maybe?

81
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,570
They don't know.

82
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,120
Chapel, straight ahead.

83
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,710
School to the left.

84
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,380
Team one hit the school.
Team 2 hit the chapel.

85
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,880
State police! We have a warrant!

86
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,550
Clear!

87
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,230
Team one to team 2. Be
advised the school is empty.

88
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,620
We have not secured the children.

89
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,500
Hit it again! Hit it again!

90
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,010
We have a hatch.

91
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,300
It's a tunnel!

92
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,820
- What's going on?
- I don't know. Just stay calm.

93
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,730
They knew we were coming.
Out! Out! Move out!

94
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,320
All right, move quietly.

95
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:19,820
Quickly go to the left.

96
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,060
Everybody stay together.

97
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,510
Children listen to your parents.

98
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,150
All right, everyone. Down
to this end. Have faith.

99
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,380
Where'd all these guns come from?

100
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,150
I don't know. Garcia checked
with the state police.

101
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,490
Stay together. Remain calm.

102
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,480
Everyone remain calm. There
is nothing to fear here.

103
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,890
This is ridiculous.

104
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,750
It's ok. Just calm down.

105
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,650
What's going on?

106
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:40,360
They're trying to breach the front door.

107
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:43,610
All right. Remain calm. Stay quiet.

108
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,030
God will protect you.

109
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:01,500
Cease fire! Cease fire!

110
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,720
Get the door open!

111
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,310
It's the state police. I'm
an officer of the state.

112
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,290
Well, there's nothing
we can do right now.

113
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,000
I can talk to him.

114
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,970
No, you can't. It's dangerous.

115
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:14,290
Nancy, stop! Nancy!

116
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,000
Go away!

117
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:20,400
We have women and children here. Please!

118
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:25,440
Cease fire! Cease fire!

119
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:28,550
Mr. Cyrus, let me talk to them.

120
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:38,200
Do not fear. We are on
the side of the righteous.

121
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,250
Where's lunde?

122
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,410
It wasn't us.

123
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,180
What? You can't shoot
it out with the cops!

124
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,840
You have children here.

125
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:49,150
I didn't start this. I'll take
the roof. You take the tunnel.

126
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,140
Rear. The hatch!

127
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,810
Man down! Man down!

128
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,940
We can't stay here!

129
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:19,320
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

130
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,840
We're giving you a chance to pull back!

131
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,340
Please, take it!

132
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,140
Bower's hit bad.

133
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:32,420
Ok. We're pulling back. Pull back!

134
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,110
They're pulling out!
They're pulling out!

135
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,240
Not for long.

What is reportedly being called a routine questions
And answers meeting by colorado child services

144
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,990
had turned into a violent
and deadly standoff

145
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,050
Between colorado authorities and a fringe
religious group known as the sepatarian sect.

146
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,840
J.j., that's not the ranch
where prentiss and reid--

147
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,370
They're still inside.

148
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,250
Hotch!

149
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:48,600
Tactical warrant service team into a forced
retreat after losing a 30-minute gun battle...

150

The tv. Prentiss and reid.

151
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,400
No one knows for sure how
many people are inside.

152
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:57,160
It is believed at least 3 of the child service
members are still trapped within the compound.

153
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,860
All right that means we're the lead with
hostage rescue and support. Let's go.

154
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:07,260
Turned deadly when the colorado state
police officers tried to serve a warrant.

155
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,930
Colorado attorney general jim
wells says the reclusive cult

156
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,590
has been the subject of a
6-month weapons investigation.

157
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,880
6 months.

158
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,830
- We didn't check?
- No. We checked.

159
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,820
I had a.t.f. Call wells.

160
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:21,400
He told a.t.f. There were no pending
state investigations. He lied.

161
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,150
Why?

162
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:25,290
Wells is challenging the
governor in the next election.

163
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:30,200
He thought that a.t.f. Was about to poach
his big election-launching weapons bust.

164
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,700
Now it's clear he didn't know
there were f.b.i.agents there.

165
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:35,610
He just thought the best time
to serve a state warrant was

166
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,770
When the kids were safe inside
the school being interviewed.

167
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,740
What do we know about this sect?

168
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,960
Liberty ranch was founded in
1980 by libertarian leo kane.

169
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:46,200
He created it as a
self-sustaining commune.

170
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,560
Libertarians believe that everyone
has the right to do what they want

171
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,660
As long as they aren't infringing
on the rights of others.

172
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,420
But libertarians aren't religious.

173
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,520
Clearly this sect abandoned
libertarian principles.

174
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:59,450
Benjamin cyrus, the current leader,
introduced religion 8 years ago when kane left.

175
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,320
Garcia, what do we got on cyrus?

176
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,320
We got bubkiss.

177
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,060
It's like the guy never cast
a shadow on the known universe.

178
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:09,550
However his predecessor, leo kane, is doing
a 17-year stretch at deerfield federal prison.

179
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,750
Apparently libertarians
do not like paying taxes.

180
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:13,460
17 years for tax evasion?

181
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,240
Oh, no.That would be
2 years for tax evasion

182
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:19,480
and 15 for going after 4 ir.s.agents
with a louisville slugger.

183
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:20,750
Let's have kane brought to the scene.

184
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:24,450
He's our best chance at finding out
some idea of who we're dealing with.

185
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,910
Miles is dead.

186
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,180
He was locking the
door when they shot him.

187
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,860
Lauren and robert were
asleep in their bed.

188
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,450
The bullets came through the wall.

189
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,010
What about the baby?

190
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,790
I have her. She was at the school.

191
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,010
Hello, darling.

192
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,380
It's all gonna be all right, honey.

193
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,310
Mommy and daddy have gone to god. Ok?

194
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,220
It's all gonna be all right.

195
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,850
Take her to the temple and pray.

196
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,770
Distribute weapons and ammo.

197
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:58,370
I prayed this day would
never come. But it has.

198
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,700
God will see us through.

199
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:24,340
Dave, they've left the choice
of negotiators up to me.

200
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,800
I taught most of the
hostage negotiation unit.

201
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,110
You want a recommendation?

202
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,230
I'm making you the lead negotiator.

203
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,120
Me?

204
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:33,790
Why go to the students
when i have the teacher?

205
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,950
Because the teacher is
emotionally involved.

206
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,300
So is the agent in command.

207
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,270
I know i am. This is a unique situation.

208
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,320
We have 2 agents who could
affect the outcome on the inside.

209
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:45,050
True. But i can't be
objective! I know them too well.

210
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:50,360
This outcome depends as much on our ability to
predict the moves of prentiss and reid as cyrus.

211
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,220
That's why you're the
best man for the job.

212
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,330
Assuming that reid and prentiss are
still in a condition to make moves.

213
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,690
I know how bad this is.

214
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,160
That's why i want you doing the talking.

215
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:03,340
- All right.
- You're obviously not in charge. I can see that!

216
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:06,290
i'm sorry, sir. I'm under
direct orders from the f.b.i.

217
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,070
I'm the attorney general of this state.

218
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,530
I demand to know why i wasn't told that

219
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,560
the f.b.i.Was sending undercover
agents into the septarian ranch.

220
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:15,530
The only thing that you're in
the position to demand is lawyer.

221
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,510
Who the hell are you?

222
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,200
I'm aaron hotchner, unit chief.

223
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:20,790
I'm the guy who's gonna tell the
attorney general of the united states

224
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:25,020
Whether to charge you with obstructing a
federal investigation or negligent homicide.

225
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,350
You can't talk to me like that.

226
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,990
Get off my crime scene.

227
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:39,300
- You know dave rossi.
- Sure.

228
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:40,830
We've been here before, haven't we?

229
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:43,800
Waco. Ruby ridge. Freeman stand off.

230
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,900
Let's hope someone listens
to you guys this time.

231
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,170
Oh, they did more than
listen. They put us in charge.

232
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,760
So bring us up to speed.

233
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,660
I've sent the state police packing.

234
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,000
They started this mess. Lost a
man in the process. Hope that's ok.

235
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:57,190
- If you hadn't. We would've.
- Good.

236
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,390
County sheriffs have had
no run-ins with the sect.

237
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,260
So we're using them as support.

238
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,170
We've had no contact with them so far.

239
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,930
They've got
power--solar.

240
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,970
We can shoot out the
panels if you think--

241
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,820
no.No. That's an escalation.

242
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:10,570
Ok. But that means they
have access to the news.

243
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,390
I'll get j.j.to talk to the press.

244
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:15,700
Your men ready to be briefed? Let's go.

245
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:18,440
We call this the
"minimal loss scenario."

246
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,530
Every person we get out is a life saved.

247
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,940
We won't save them all.

248
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:28,560
All of us have to be prepared
to accept that situation.

249
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:32,110
Cults are structured like pyramids.

250
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,370
You got the leader at the top.

251
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,400
Diehard believers beneath.

252
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:41,460
The biggest group--
the base--followers.

253
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,120
Woman and children. These
are the people we can save.

254
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:50,650
The "trickle, flow, gush" strategy
is designed to get base followers out.

255
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,930
First, one or two. Then 3 or 4.

256
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,080
Then as many as we
can as fast as we can.

257
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:58,500
And if at any point it
starts to go bad, we go in.

258
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:01,460
The leaders are charismatic sociopaths

259
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:05,010
who target those most
susceptible to their seduction.

260
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,910
They have the ability to
see what each person needs.

261
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,610
And then they become that thing.

262
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:15,970
We have to undermine their perception that we're
an invading army laying siege to their home.

263
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,080
We'll lose the fatigues.

264
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,620
Will rancher's clothes work for ya?

265
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,340
Like we did at the freeman stand off?

266
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,940
Perfect. Anything we can do
to demilitarize the situation.

267
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:26,980
Hello?

268
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:30,440
You killed my mom and daddy.
Are you going to kill me to?

269
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,850
No one is going to kill you, honey.

270
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:35,430
This is benjamin cyrus.
Who am i talking to?

271
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,490
David rossi, an f.b.i.agent.

272
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,950
We sent the state police away.

273
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,910
There's just us and the local sheriff.

274
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,870
All we want to do is resolve
this before anyone else gets hurt.

275
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,450
Then leave us alone.

276
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,160
I'm afraid we can't do that, benjamin.

277
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:50,710
One of the police bled out
on the way to the hospital.

278
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:53,680
So let's just stop this
before things get worse.

279
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:57,060
Please, just put down
your guns and come out.

280
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:59,180
We're believers, dave.

281
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,840
We believe that god says what
he means and means what he says.

282
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,630
His laws don't depend on
what state you live in.

283
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:06,640
I have no issue with your beliefs.

284
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:08,540
You don't. But the state does.

285
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,570
I can't answer for other people.

286
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:14,640
Oh, god will answer for everyone
in the final battle i've foreseen.

287
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:18,590
That's why i'm here-- to make
sure that this is not that battle.

288
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,290
We shall see.

289
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,550
Now, the 3 child services workers...

290
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,250
One of them is dead.

291
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,470
It wasn't us.

292
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,920
I need a name to inform the family.

293
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:33,190
Her name was nancy lunde.

294
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,300
Ok.

295
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,660
Now, please, benjamin,
send out your wounded.

296
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,640
I promise you they'll
be well taken care of.

297
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,850
With enough supplies
we can tend to our own.

298
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,370
Ok. I need a few hours
to put it together.

299
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:48,440
I'll bring them up
myself at first light.

300
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,230
They could take you hostage.

301
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,960
I'm gonna confirm the kids,
prentiss, and reid are ok.

302
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,610
Rossi, at least let me go with you.

303
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,850
No. This is about
building trust. I go alone.

304
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,970
I want the parabolic arc mics fixed
on every window in that structure.

305
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,320
They won't pick up much. They
have blinds on all the windows.

306
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:09,480
Unless they're shouting, the glass won't
vibrate enough for us to get an audio.

307
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:14,100
Well, if they're not shouting, these bugs will
pick 'em up, at least until the batteries die.

308
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:17,290
How familiar are agents prentiss
and reid with our playbook?

309
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,320
The b.a.u.wrote the cirg handbook.

310
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:21,530
They'll know that we're trying
to get ears in there at all times.

311
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,980
Good. Let's hope they can
get these people talking.

312
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:25,410
They will.

313
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:12,720
Dave? I'm ben. Come on in.

314
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:37,260
The children.

315
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:40,480
And our guests.

316
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:44,580
I'd hoped you'd let
me take the children.

317
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,250
Nah, their our protection.

318
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:48,550
I remember waco. We all do.

319
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,860
This isn't waco.

320
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,240
They stay for now...

321
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,210
While i pray for god's guidance.

322
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,500
Please don't try to force us out.

323
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:02,150
No one's gonna try to force
you out of here. Trust me.

324
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,250
Trust is earned.

325
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,540
It is.

326
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,180
Tell them i'm not crazy.

327
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,840
Tell them i'm just a
man living by god's law.

328
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,830
I will.

329
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,020
Prepare the wine.

330
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,710
We are celebrating.

331
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,910
Everyone drinks. Everyone rejoices.

332
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:38,370
Because today we are one
day closer to being with him.

333
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,280
Look at jessica's body language.

334
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:44,400
The way she looks at him.

335
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:48,260
She literally worships him. There's
no way she made that 9-1-1 call.

336
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,140
Trust in god with all your heart.

337
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,630
Lean not on your own understandings.

338
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,660
Trust in mine.

339
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,320
Look how she comes between
cyrus and her daughter.

340
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,920
She's inserted herself between them.

341
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:08,740
Acknowledge him in all things,
and he will guide your way.

342
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,240
Drink to acknowledge him.

343
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:12,990
And i will guide our way.

344
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:21,950
Reid and prentiss are ok.

345
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,480
What about cyrus?

346
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,160
He's too calm.

347
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,320
It's--it's like he was
waiting for this to happen.

348
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,420
And now that it has,
he feels vindicated.

349
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:31,740
I got a signal. I'm
getting a signal here.

350
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,570
We will be with him soon.

351
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:37,320
We have drank the poison together.

352
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:49,250
Mothers...

353
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,050
Fathers...

354
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:58,120
Children, though we walk through the valley
of the shadow of death we fear no evil.

355
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,090
For thou are with us.

356
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,440
This doesn't fit.

357
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:04,180
I looked him in the
eye. He was calm, lucid.

358
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,560
They're committing mass suicide.

359
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,470
We don't know that for sure.

360
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:08,310
- Rossi, he just said it.
- We're ready to go.

361
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,100
If we go in there,
people are going to die.

362
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,180
People are already dying.

363
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,370
And god will wipe the
tears from their eyes,

364
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:19,080
and there will be no more
death nor sorrow nor crying.

365
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,680
And there will be no more pain.

366
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,830
For all of the former
things have passed away.

367
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,830
- What do we do?
- Nothing.

368
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,430
We have to do something.
These people just took poison.

369
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,760
Cyrus just told them he did.
I think he's just bluffing.

370
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:32,890
Why do you think that?

371
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:36,670
Just after he told them about the poison,
he waited for them to start to react.

372
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:40,790
Then he nodded to cole. And
he started writing. Look.

373
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,320
They're scanning the audience
looking for reactions.

374
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,440
They're writing down the names
of the people who are crying.

375
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,110
It's a loyalty list.

376
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:49,700
So he knows who will
follow him to the end.

377
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:51,450
Jim jones pulled the same stunt!

378
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:54,590
They did a test run just like this
years before they did the real thing.

379
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:56,660
Prepare your men to go in.

380
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,270
Be still. There was no poison.

381
00:20:59,280 --> 00:20:59,930
Dan...

382
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,890
Instead a test of faith.

383
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:07,350
Because your adversary, the devil,
waltzes about as a roaring lion!

384
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,170
Choosing whom he may devour.

385
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:17,850
Watch each other for signs of weakness.

386
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:22,330
You are your brother's keeper.

387
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,800
- Tell 'em to stand down.
- Yes, sir.

388
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,380
Nice call.

389
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,190
Former sect leader is here.

390
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,010
I got it.

391
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:36,080
Charles mulgrew is his real name.

392
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:37,820
Charles mulgrew.

393
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,230
His mother was 5 months pregnant
when she showed up at our doorstep.

394
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,400
He turned out to be
one of the smart ones.

395
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,870
Amazing memory that kid had.

396
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,600
Anything he read he could
repeat back to you. And he did.

397
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:50,480
Mouthy little son of a bitch.

398
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:52,200
Why'd he leave the ranch?

399
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:55,390
When he was 17 a couple of
our young girls came to me

400
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,520
and said that he'd
been messing with them.

401
00:21:58,530 --> 00:21:59,890
You mean sexually?

402
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,350
Yes, sir. I do.

403
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,770
Now, don't get me wrong.
I'm a libertarian. But...

404
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:09,970
Those little girls were too young
for a 17 year old to be messing with.

405
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,650
So you kicked him out for that?

406
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,620
Yes, sir. I did.

407
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,840
His mother took him to kentucky.

408
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:17,530
Hadn't heard anything
from him for years.

409
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:20,620
And then when he finally showed up
again, he said his mother had died,

410
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,390
He found god, and he
wanted to come home.

411
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,440
How does a kid like that get rid of you?

412
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:29,640
One day he came to me and said god
told him that i should leave the ranch.

413
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:32,300
I said if god felt that
way, god can tell me himself.

414
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:36,930
He put a gun to my head
and said, he just did.

415
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:42,250
Took me 20 years to build that ranch.

416
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:48,470
I'll do anything i can to help you seed that
ungrateful son of a bitch straight to hell.

417
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,330
I need a map.

418
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,770
Charles mulgrew--convicted
in kentucky at the age of 18.

419
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,290
3 counts, statutory rape.

420
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,590
So we need to talk to the warden?

421
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:58,570
Way ahead of you, honey.

422
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:03,130
Mr. Kentucky warden said that once inside,
mulgrew found religion, became a model citizen.

423
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,240
Well, it's not that hard to behave when
you're in protective custody the whole time.

424
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,660
General population's a rough
place for a child molester.

425
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:11,450
No. No. I don't think you guys
understand. He was a model citizen.

426
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,680
This guy volunteered at the
prison hospital-- the aids ward--

427
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:15,890
He was reading to
prisoners dying of H.I. V.

428
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,700
Good stuff.

429
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,150
Damn straight. Now get
our friends back, baby.

430
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:21,630
Well, this makes things worse.

431
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,470
What? That he was a model citizen?

432
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,950
That he's been to prison.

433
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,560
He knows what happens
to child molesters there.

434
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:30,210
If the current sexual allegations
are true and he thinks we know it,

435
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,800
he's not coming out of there.

436
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:34,690
Then we have to make him
think he's not going back.

437
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:40,230
J. J., I need you to release a press statement saying
that we have absolutely no evidence of sexual allegations.

438
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,870
You need to see this.

439
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:47,350
Now well into its second day, the standoff at the
sepatarian sect ranch has now been taken over by the F. B. I.

440
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,720
There was much speculation
in regard to hostages.

441
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:53,170
But anonymous sources inside the state
attorney general's office have told us

442
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:58,290
There is an undercover f.b.i.agent currently
being held inside the sepatarian sect ranch.

443
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,260
Hostage negotiators say they are making
headway with the sect's leadership

444
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:03,690
And are hopeful for a positive outcome.

445
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:08,350
There's still no word as to why an
undercover F. B. I.agent was sent in alone.

446
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,210
Which one of you is it?

447
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:23,160
Which one of you is the F. B. I.agent?

448
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,460
Why do you think one of
us is an F. B. I. Agent?

449
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,850
God will forgive me for what i must do.

450
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,450
I--i don't know what
you're talking about.

451
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:38,390
One of you does. Who is it?

452
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,690
Me. It's me.

453
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:07,390
I told you not to put
me in this position!

454
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,200
- We gotta go in there.
- We'd be risking the lives everyone in there.

455
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:18,150
Get up!

456
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:26,270
Proverbs 20:30 tells us blows
and wounds cleanse away evil.

457
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,990
I can take it.

458
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:34,140
Oh, you can take it?

459
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:38,000
Wait--wait. Listen
to what she's saying.

460
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,180
I can take it.

461
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,330
She's antagonizing him.

462
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,400
She's not talking to him.

463
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:44,940
She's talking to us. She's
telling us not to come in.

464
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:48,040
Pride comes before the fall.

465
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,950
Tie her up. Put her upstairs.

466
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,980
You should have told cyrus who you were.

467
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,900
He's a prophet.

468
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:15,150
He predicted satan's armies
would come and lay siege to us.

469
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:18,600
There's a name for that kind
of prophecy-- self fulfilling.

470
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:22,290
You don't know how dangerous
it is to lie to him.

471
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:30,280
I know it would take a brave woman
to defy him, knowing the consequences.

472
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:35,200
And that that woman would have to
have a damn good reason to do it.

473
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,100
Did you know she was F. B. I?

474
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,220
Nancy told me the woman was a child
abuse interview expert from denver.

475
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:04,470
In 4 years i worked with her,
nancy never lied to me before.

476
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:07,450
As far as you know.

477
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,920
Their law says that a
15-year-old girl is a child.

478
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:16,200
50 years ago that same law
said a 14 year old was an adult.

479
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:19,140
Have children changed
so much in 50 years?

480
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:24,060
I can't tell you the number of times i've investigated
abuse charges against small religious groups.

481
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:26,070
Almost all of them turn out to be false.

482
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,550
What do you think of that?

483
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,040
Doesn't really matter what i think.

484
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,380
- It does to me.
- Why?

485
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:33,270
Because god wants to save you.

486
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:36,930
I mean, that's why he sent
you here. That's the reason.

487
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,360
On the next call, you should test them.

488
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,420
Test the negotiator. Make him
prove that he isn't a liar.

489
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:50,050
How would you suggest i do that?

490
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,510
Ask for the identity
of the F. B. I.agent.

491
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,950
No. We already know her identity.

492
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,210
- They don't know that.
- Yeah. But the F. B. I.would never tell us.

493
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,330
They keep on asking
you to release people.

494
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:02,200
Tell him you'll release a kid,
and you won't harm the agent.

495
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:04,660
And if they really care about the
children, they'll have to tell you.

496
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:06,640
You're trying to get
us to release a child.

497
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,740
It's one kid.

498
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:10,730
If they don't hold up on their end of
the deal, you know they can't be trusted.

499
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,310
He has a point.

500
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,020
Reid has him.

501
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,270
What is it, christopher?

502
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:20,930
Some have been talking about... Leaving.

503
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:24,660
- Leaving?
- Yeah.

504
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,290
Wake the baby.

505
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,480
Let's let them meet the
orphan that they've made.

506
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,450
How you doing today, ben?

507
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:48,170
I will release a child if you tell
me the identity of the F. B. I.agent.

508
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:51,350
I promise no harm will come to
them from this point forward.

509
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:53,390
I can't give you that information.

510
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:56,110
I will send the child now.

511
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:25,730
Hey, it's ok. It's ok.
Come to me, sweetie.

512
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,400
You're safe now. We got her, hotch.

513
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:35,010
We're taking a big risk here, ben.

514
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,800
Trust is earned.

515
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,810
Her name name is emily prentiss.

516
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:43,250
She came in with 2 child service
workers to talk to the girls.

517
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:46,130
There's a good chance we
can work this out, dave.

518
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:49,020
I'm gonna provide another
sign of good faith.

519
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,730
You're doing a good thing here.

520
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,350
Assemble everyone in the chapel.

521
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,240
Get agent prentiss down here.

522
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:04,890
It has come to my attention that some of our
brothers and sisters have lost their faith in god.

523
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:06,570
That they no longer love us.

524
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:09,160
They want to abandon us.

525
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:12,140
So when i call out
your name, please stand.

526
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:14,280
Todd sutters.

527
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:16,290
Melanie sutters...

528
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:18,700
He looks pissed.

529
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,550
Evan radley.

530
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,580
It's not as bad as it looks.

531
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,850
I'm so sorry.

532
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:27,750
Sean ebbins. Sherry...

533
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,470
Look at who he's releasing.

534
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,690
Wyatt rayborn.

535
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,680
It's the ones who
failed the loyalty test.

536
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:36,560
Doris beasley.

537
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:37,830
We'll get word to the team.

538
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:41,210
Wait for a sign from outside to
indicate what time the raid will come.

539
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,630
Willis farwell.

540
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,610
I told her she shouldn't
have lied to you like that.

541
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:51,960
To either of us. Take her back.

542
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:56,770
Those of you that are standing,
please collect your belongings

543
00:30:56,810 --> 00:31:00,030
And report to the front
hallway immediately.

544
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,640
We will surrender tomorrow at noon.

545
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:19,460
I want the press there to
insure that we're treated fairly.

546
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:22,420
We'll discuss the details
in our 7:00 A. M.call.

547
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:24,770
- I'll see you then, dave.
- I look forward to it.

548
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:27,760
Oh, and one more thing.
Could you send some food in.

549
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:29,220
Sure. What would you like?

550
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:31,220
Fried chicken, all the fixin's.

551
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:33,410
You got it.

552
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,470
I don't understand.
Why did you let them go?

553
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,090
They weren't prepared to
do what needs to be done.

554
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,720
You're not one of us.

555
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,520
You don't know what it
takes to be prepared.

556
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:45,190
Listen to him. Tell him.

557
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,360
They failed the test.

558
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:49,280
They--they had a chance to prove
their faith when cyrus told them

559
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:50,960
That they'd sacrifice
themselves for god.

560
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:53,780
But instead they showed
they weren't worthy.

561
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:58,330
That's why he wants the media to bare
witness to your true final act of sacrifice.

562
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,570
How do you know that?

563
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:02,110
I'm always looking for
signs of things to come.

564
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,540
Reid's talking to us.

565
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:05,180
He wants a sign when we're coming in.

566
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,660
He's telling us this is it.

567
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,460
Time has run out. We've got to go in.

568
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,930
Drugging the food is not an
option because of the children.

569
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,060
We have to go in.

570
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,580
Best time to hit 'em is when
they're least mentally prepared.

571
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,640
3:00 A. M.biorhythms are
at their low point then.

572
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:23,780
We need a diversion. Something
that plays into his expectations.

573
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:25,430
- Cyrus brought up waco.
- Right.

574
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,300
I know exactly how to use that.

575
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,220
We need some humvees.

576
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,270
The plan depends on reid and prentiss
separating the diehards from the followers.

577
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:35,120
And delaying cyrus's diehards
from reacting to our assault.

578
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:37,630
That's not my main concern. Reid and
prentiss know what they need to do.

579
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,690
So what is your concern?

580
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,660
Letting them know when we're coming.

581
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:43,180
The whole things hinges on them
being ready for us at 3:00 A. M.

582
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:47,300
Come on, guys, quick. We need to get those
bugs in the boxes before it gets too cold.

583
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:50,920
Perfect.

584
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,070
Let's hope it's just that easy.

585
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,490
If you can hear me,
i know you're coming.

586
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,480
I can try to get the women and
children down to the tunnel,

587
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:27,280
But i need to know when you're coming.

588
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:33,400
- What is it?
- Prentiss. She's talking to us.

589
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:35,440
If you can hear me i know you're coming.

590
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:38,270
I can try to get the women and
children down to the tunnel,

591
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,370
But i need to know when you're coming.

592
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,210
Let's go.

593
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,010
I can try to get the women and
children down to the tunnel,

594
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,900
But i need to know when you're coming.

595
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:55,750
But i need to know when you're coming.

596
00:33:56,170 --> 00:34:00,120
If you can hear me, i
know you're coming. I can--

597
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:05,410
Ok.ok. I got you. What time? What time?

598
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:10,560
3:00 a. M.

599
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,440
Understood.

600
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:17,790
Reid is on the first
floor somewhere with cyrus.

601
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,270
And please remember
there are children here.

602
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,320
Someone's coming.

603
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:25,220
Hold on, emily.

604
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:32,570
I know what you're thinking.

605
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,220
You don't have to be a
part of this. You can go.

606
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,780
I think i'd prefer to stay.

607
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:43,100
Somebody needs to tell your story.

608
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,230
And i'm glad it'll be you.

609
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:49,180
Now that the false believers
have been cleared from our midst,

610
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:52,580
we make our final preparations.

611
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:19,420
Cyrus is planning a mass suicide.

612
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:22,510
You made the
9-1-1 call.

613
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,790
This is all my fault.

614
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,680
None of this would have happened
if i hadn't of made that call.

615
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,810
You were trying to
protect your daughter.

616
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,050
There were other girls before jessie.

617
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,900
He--he would marry
them in secret.

618
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:41,000
And after a while, he'd take another.

619
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,820
And we weren't permitted to speak of it.

620
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:49,160
And so when she asked for my consent,
i wanted to just take her and run.

621
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:52,340
But i was afraid she wouldn't leave him.

622
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,880
You wanted us to take her?

623
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:57,400
Well, i--i wanted to
save her from cyrus.

624
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,840
I can give you another chance.

625
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:03,410
The F. B. I.is coming here at 3:00 A. M.

626
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:07,790
I need you to gather jessica,
the kids, the other women--

627
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:11,050
Get them into the basement
just before 3:00 A. M.

628
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,880
Why are you telling me this?

629
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:18,430
Because i have faith that you are a strong
enough woman to do the right thing for jessica.

630
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:32,480
I know i can't go in there.

631
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,260
I'm going.

632
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:39,330
If something happens to prentiss
or reid, i... I don't know.

633
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:44,250
You're not alone.

634
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:19,270
- What is it?
- Come on. Come on.

635
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:34,260
You were right. They're
setting the place to blow up.

636
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:38,490
I told jessie cyrus wanted her
gather the women and children.

637
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,000
Where is the man i came in with?

638
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:44,310
He's in the chapel with cyrus.
It's 2:45 though. We gotta hurry.

639
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:55,900
Something's wrong.

640
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:11,100
They lied to us.

641
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:13,720
Should we do it now?

642
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:18,860
No. Let 'em get closer.

643
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:26,680
Cyrus, what are you doing?

644
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:29,750
Making sure the press is watching.

645
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,230
They're gonna want to see this.

646
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:43,180
This is it. The moment of faith.

647
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,840
Go. Go. Go. Go.

648
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:09,790
It came from inside the building.

649
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,730
Go check the fuses.

650
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,740
Go.

651
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:18,710
Emily, you all right?

652
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,530
They've wired explosives.

653
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:21,430
Everybody come on.

654
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,970
- Let's go this way.
- Let's go kids.

655
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,630
Ok. This building's gonna blow up.

656
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,550
Where's reid?

657
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,780
- He's in the chapel with cyrus.
- We gotta get you out of here.

658
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:29,940
- No. We've gotta get reid!
- Prentiss, i will get reid.

659
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,490
Get out of here. Get to safety. Go now.

660
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,340
Cyrus didn't call for this.

661
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:34,900
You lied to me!

662
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,390
No, cyrus lied to you, honey.

663
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,220
- He can't--he's
my husband. - No!

664
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:44,030
I will get her for you.

665
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,300
Rossi, get her out of here.

666
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:47,770
Torre, get your boys. Let's do this now.

667
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:55,000
Jeremiah 29:11-- "i have for you," declares the
lord, "plans to prosper you and not to harm you.

668
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:57,130
Plans to bring you hope and a future."

669
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:00,190
Is blowing yourself up part of the
prosperous future that god wants?

670
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,280
You think you know
the word better than i?

671
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:06,130
No. I'm just demonstrating that you can
use the bible to manipulate anything.

672
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:10,190
Matthew 10:24-- "do not suppose that
i've come to the earth to bring peace.

673
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:13,520
I did not come to bring
peace but a sword."

674
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:18,630
You cannot convert my brothers.

675
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,440
No one had to follow.

676
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:37,080
God could have stopped me.

677
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,740
- He just did.

Sweetheart, come with me. We
need to get you out of here.

681

00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,880
"reason is not automatic.

691
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:22,890
Those who deny it cannot
be conquered by it."

Ayn rand.

I need you to listen to me.

00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:44,350
What cyrus did to me is not your fault.

695
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:48,190
It was my decision,
and i would do it again.

696
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:51,730
Do you hear me?
