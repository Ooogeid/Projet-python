George foyet is the reaper.

00:00:19,901 --> 00:00:21,834
Foyet escaped.
where's my badge?

10
00:00:21,901 --> 00:00:23,701
Guards found him
in his cell vomiting
blood and convulsing.

11
00:00:23,767 --> 00:00:25,033
They rushed him to
the prison hospital.

12
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,567
They're gonna find him,
right?

13
00:00:26,634 --> 00:00:28,067
No, they're not.

14
00:00:28,133 --> 00:00:31,033

We're not working a case.

21
00:00:45,634 --> 00:00:47,067
Why call us
to a crime scene?

22
00:00:47,133 --> 00:00:49,667
I was hoping you knew.

23
00:00:49,734 --> 00:00:52,067

it was urgent.

00:01:10,133 --> 00:01:11,234
Thanks for being here.

Who's the victim?

His name is nelson martinez.

32
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,534
From what we can figure,
he answered his door,

33
00:01:18,601 --> 00:01:19,968
Was forced into
the apartment at gunpoint

34
00:01:20,033 --> 00:01:22,467
And then shot in the chest.
it was all pretty sloppy.

35
00:01:22,534 --> 00:01:24,834
No disrespect,
but i don't understand
why you need us here.

36
00:01:24,901 --> 00:01:27,200
2 days ago, a local doctor
named tom barton

37
00:01:27,267 --> 00:01:29,267
Found a note addressed
to him at the hospital.

38
00:01:29,334 --> 00:01:31,868
It said the person was
planning to kill his son.

39
00:01:31,934 --> 00:01:33,868
If dr. barton tried
to keep his boy hidden,

40
00:01:33,934 --> 00:01:36,067
One person would die
every day in his place.

41
00:01:36,133 --> 00:01:37,467
And you think
this is connected?

42
00:01:37,534 --> 00:01:39,901
Reid:
the note is signed l.c.

43
00:01:39,968 --> 00:01:41,767

yesterday we had another victim.

44
00:01:41,834 --> 00:01:43,934
Multiple gunshots
outside the apartment.

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,868
The shooter wrote l.c.
in white chalk next to the body.

46
00:01:46,934 --> 00:01:50,167
Now, unless dr. barton
puts his son in harm's way,

47
00:01:50,234 --> 00:01:51,801
We're going to keep having
a victim a day.

48
00:01:51,868 --> 00:01:53,434
Where's barton now?

49
00:01:53,501 --> 00:01:55,067
He's at home. he doesn't
know about this victim yet.

50
00:01:55,133 --> 00:01:56,667
Where's hotch?

51
00:01:56,734 --> 00:01:58,601
He's not answering his cell.
i assume it's on vibrate.

52
00:01:58,667 --> 00:02:00,100
He'll get the message
when he wakes up.

53
00:02:00,167 --> 00:02:02,734
Try him again. he can
meet us at barton's house.

Listen, we're gonna need you
to meet us at an address

00:02:17,567 --> 00:02:19,567
In mclean, virginia--
120 kensington road.

00:02:19,634 --> 00:02:21,467
Call me when you get this.

00:02:22,701 --> 00:02:26,033
Prentiss: dr. barton,
where is your son right now?

64
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,367
Um, i asked him
to stay up in his room.

65
00:02:28,434 --> 00:02:30,200
Jj: and what did you tell him?

66
00:02:30,267 --> 00:02:31,701
[clears throat]

67
00:02:31,767 --> 00:02:34,434
I told him that there
was a threat against me
at the hospital.

68
00:02:34,501 --> 00:02:36,534
I told him the police
didn't take it seriously

69
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:38,534
But that they wanted me
to stay here for a few days

70
00:02:38,601 --> 00:02:40,200
And that i wanted
to have him with me.

71
00:02:40,267 --> 00:02:41,534
And jeffrey's mother?

72
00:02:41,601 --> 00:02:43,534
She died when he was 10.

73
00:02:43,601 --> 00:02:45,200
Breast cancer.

74
00:02:45,267 --> 00:02:46,868
Would someone
really hurt jeffrey?

75
00:02:46,934 --> 00:02:48,567
2 people are dead already.

76
00:02:48,634 --> 00:02:51,667
Whoever sent that note
is obviously serious.

77
00:02:51,734 --> 00:02:54,467
And if i don't let
jeffrey out of the house,

78
00:02:54,534 --> 00:02:56,367
Then another person's gonna die?

79
00:02:56,434 --> 00:02:58,467
Right now we have to assume
that he will keep killing.

80
00:02:58,534 --> 00:02:59,868
My son is 15 years old.

81
00:02:59,934 --> 00:03:01,067
I understand.

82
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:02,767
I cannot put him in danger.

83
00:03:02,834 --> 00:03:04,334
We are not asking you to.

84
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,767
And even if
you were willing,

85
00:03:05,834 --> 00:03:07,334
We couldn't
send him to school

86
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,067
Knowing he would
endanger every student
in the building.

87
00:03:09,133 --> 00:03:11,167
What we need to do now

88
00:03:11,234 --> 00:03:12,834
Is go over everything
we know,

89
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,667
Piece together how this
person fits into your life.

90
00:03:15,734 --> 00:03:18,000
Well, i--i--
i can't think of anyone

91
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:20,033
Who would want to kill jeffrey.

92
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,667
Whoever wrote that note
was putting you on notice--

93
00:03:22,734 --> 00:03:23,901
This is personal.

94
00:03:23,968 --> 00:03:25,934
He wants you to remember
who he is,

95
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,100
And until that happens,
he hasn't accomplished
what he set out to do.

been asked this before,
but, please,

there's no one.

101
00:03:41,434 --> 00:03:43,868
Have you noticed anyone
who might have been
watching you,

102
00:03:43,934 --> 00:03:46,367
Either at the hospital
or here in the neighborhood?

103

I...i'm sorry.

104
00:03:47,968 --> 00:03:51,367
Both the victims he's killed
have been hispanic men
in their 40s.

105
00:03:51,434 --> 00:03:53,567
Have you had a patient
recently that fits
the description?

106
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:55,701
I'm a trauma surgeon in d.c.

107
00:03:55,767 --> 00:03:58,334
I have endless patients,
all demographics.

108
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,968
We're gonna need records of
all your recent surgeries.

109
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:02,434
Of course.

110
00:04:02,501 --> 00:04:03,701
I'll call garcia.

I--i don't understand.

112
00:04:05,834 --> 00:04:07,767
If he's mad at me,
why not just kill me?

113
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,634
Jj. is there any word
from hotch?

114
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:13,767
No, nothing.

What--what's happening?
are you ok?

124
00:04:30,133 --> 00:04:32,367
Jeffrey, what's going on?

125
00:04:35,367 --> 00:04:37,534
Talk to me.

126
00:04:38,334 --> 00:04:39,801
He's not up here.

127
00:04:39,868 --> 00:04:41,868
Jeffrey, where are you?

00:04:41,934 --> 00:04:43,133
I'm at school.

The safest place for him to be
is at that school.

We can control access

is done.

for a living.

This is his way of trying
to save lives, too.

You know, for a smart boy,

Yes, my love.
hey, garcia.

177
00:07:07,217 --> 00:07:09,284
Has hotch checked in
with you?

178
00:07:09,351 --> 00:07:10,584
He's not with you?

179
00:07:10,651 --> 00:07:11,751
He's probably on his way.

180
00:07:11,818 --> 00:07:13,184
Uh, thanks
for everything. bye.

181
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,850
She's going to email
the files. we'll print
them out from here.

182
00:07:15,917 --> 00:07:17,351
I could have my office
send over the files.

183
00:07:17,417 --> 00:07:19,384
No, no, trust us,
this is faster.

184
00:07:19,451 --> 00:07:20,517
We need to dig
through your life

185
00:07:20,584 --> 00:07:21,950
And try to figure out
why this is happening.

186
00:07:22,017 --> 00:07:23,850
Let's start with
the most recent cases first,

187
00:07:23,917 --> 00:07:27,050
Something set this
guy off, and odds are
it's in your files.

188
00:07:27,117 --> 00:07:28,217
[bell rings]

189
00:07:28,284 --> 00:07:29,784
I need to notify
all the parents.

190
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,417
We think
that's a mistake.

191
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:33,050
I'm in charge of
keeping these kids safe.

192
00:07:33,117 --> 00:07:35,551
Exactly. and there's
a natural end to this day,

193
00:07:35,617 --> 00:07:38,317
When buses and parents
come to pick these kids up.

194
00:07:38,384 --> 00:07:40,217
Whoever's doing this
is not an effectual shooter.

195
00:07:40,284 --> 00:07:41,784
His killings are sloppy.

196
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,584
So if there's a panic,
a lot of people could be
caught in the crossfire.

197
00:07:44,651 --> 00:07:46,351
Can't you just
take jeffrey home?

198
00:07:46,417 --> 00:07:48,217
If we do that
and the unsub is watching,

199
00:07:48,284 --> 00:07:49,584
Someone else is gonna be killed.

200
00:07:49,651 --> 00:07:50,883
Then what?

201
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,184
We lock up every filter point
except the front door.

202
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,883
Nobody comes in.
we say it's school policy.

203
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,983
No questions. and if someone
needs to see a student,

204
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,417
We bring the kids to them.

205
00:08:00,484 --> 00:08:02,584
I'll need a complete list
and employment records

206
00:08:02,651 --> 00:08:05,983
Of everyone already
inside the building.

207
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,084
I'll brief
your security guards

208
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,850
And take care of
all of the exits.

209
00:08:09,917 --> 00:08:12,284
After that, i need you
to gather the faculty

210
00:08:12,351 --> 00:08:14,451
Into small groups
and bring them to me.

211
00:08:14,517 --> 00:08:16,684
Treat it as routine.

212
00:08:16,751 --> 00:08:17,883
And in the meantime,
i need you

213
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,684
To get jeffrey out of class
as casually as possible.

214
00:08:19,751 --> 00:08:21,150
Can you do that?

215
00:08:30,917 --> 00:08:32,850
Jeffrey barton.

216
00:08:32,917 --> 00:08:34,551
Can i see you for a moment?

217
00:08:34,617 --> 00:08:37,050
[students murmuring]

218
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,250
Hey, jeffrey.

219
00:08:44,317 --> 00:08:46,917
My name's derek morgan.
i'm with the fbi.

220
00:08:46,983 --> 00:08:48,551
I saw you in my living room.

221
00:08:48,617 --> 00:08:49,950
Listen, the first thing
i need to know

222
00:08:50,017 --> 00:08:52,517
Is if you've told anyone
about what's happening?

223
00:08:52,584 --> 00:08:54,017
No.

224
00:08:54,084 --> 00:08:55,751
[students talking indistinctly]

225
00:08:55,818 --> 00:08:58,217
Back to class.
no loitering.

226
00:09:00,617 --> 00:09:02,150
Jeffrey, you're sure?

227
00:09:02,217 --> 00:09:04,917
Because even just
one text message
could set this place off.

228
00:09:04,983 --> 00:09:05,917
I'm sure.

229
00:09:05,983 --> 00:09:07,084
All right, that's good.

230
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,950
We're gonna keep you
safe, kid.

231
00:09:09,017 --> 00:09:11,517
But in order to do that,
you're gonna have to
stay calm.

232
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:13,117
And you're also gonna
have to trust me.

233
00:09:13,184 --> 00:09:14,451
You understand?

234
00:09:14,517 --> 00:09:16,184
Every time you step
out of class,

235
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,217
I will be right here.

236
00:09:17,284 --> 00:09:19,417
Now, it's gonna look
like i'm just another

237
00:09:19,484 --> 00:09:21,017
Adult in the hallway
with principal findlay,

238
00:09:21,084 --> 00:09:22,451
But i got your back.

239
00:09:22,517 --> 00:09:23,850
Is my dad ok?

240
00:09:23,917 --> 00:09:26,250
He knows you were
just trying to do
the right thing.

241
00:09:26,317 --> 00:09:27,950
He just wants to
get you home safe.

242
00:09:28,017 --> 00:09:30,184
Do you think somebody's
trying to kill me

243
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,451
To get back at him?

244
00:09:31,517 --> 00:09:33,017
It is possible.

245
00:09:33,084 --> 00:09:34,617
Do you know why?

246
00:09:34,684 --> 00:09:37,917
That's what
we need to figure out.

247
00:09:37,983 --> 00:09:39,517
Let's concentrate
on the note.

248
00:09:39,584 --> 00:09:43,317
For starters,
we know that he's male.

249
00:09:43,384 --> 00:09:44,517
How can you be sure?

250
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,384
Women tend to add adjectives

251
00:09:46,451 --> 00:09:48,050
And very specific details
to their notes.

252
00:09:48,117 --> 00:09:49,384
This has none of those.

253
00:09:49,451 --> 00:09:50,883
Males are also more direct.

254
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:53,317
First sentence--"i plan
to kill your son."

255
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,250
And their notes tend to be
more about themselves

256
00:09:55,317 --> 00:09:57,117
Than the person
they're writing to.

257
00:09:57,184 --> 00:09:59,050
"i watched you every day."

258
00:09:59,117 --> 00:10:01,384
"i will watch you
lose everything."

259
00:10:01,451 --> 00:10:03,050
We know he surveilled
you and your son,

260
00:10:03,117 --> 00:10:04,551
Which means he either
has enough money

261
00:10:04,617 --> 00:10:05,950
To be away from
a regular job

262
00:10:06,017 --> 00:10:07,684
Or he's currently
unemployed.

263
00:10:07,751 --> 00:10:09,351
He's most likely a father.

264
00:10:09,417 --> 00:10:10,818
He's clearly grieving.

265
00:10:10,883 --> 00:10:14,317
He's taken great measures
to make sure you feel his pain.

266
00:10:14,384 --> 00:10:16,217
Let's start with cases
involving teenagers killed,

267
00:10:16,284 --> 00:10:18,850
But also anyone with
a strong family presence.

268
00:10:18,917 --> 00:10:20,751
Just because your son
is 15,

269
00:10:20,818 --> 00:10:23,417
That doesn't necessarily
mean that his child
is the same age.

270
00:10:23,484 --> 00:10:26,351
Have you had a lot
of cases like this,

271
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,250
Where someone taunts you
with what they're gonna do?

272
00:10:28,317 --> 00:10:30,451
A few.

273
00:10:30,517 --> 00:10:32,784
And how did they end?

274
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,084
Please.

275
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,084
Suicide by cop seems
to be an effective way

276
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,417
For them to make
their point,

277
00:10:41,484 --> 00:10:45,351
While ending their
suffering all at once.

278
00:10:47,617 --> 00:10:49,617
Jeffrey is leaving school
in 5 hours.

279
00:10:49,684 --> 00:10:52,484
There's no way we can
get through all these
patients in this time.

280
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:54,117
Well, now, we've narrowed
it down already.

281
00:10:54,184 --> 00:10:55,584
And we still have
100 left.

282
00:10:55,651 --> 00:10:57,417
I'm sorry, i don't mean
to be callous,

283
00:10:57,484 --> 00:10:59,551
But when you work
in the e.r., you don't
remember names.

284
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,317
You operate
and you move on.

285
00:11:01,384 --> 00:11:03,784
He's right. there are
too many files here

286
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,950
For us to profile in such
a short period of time.

287
00:11:06,017 --> 00:11:08,551
Um, i can get to hotch's

288
00:11:08,617 --> 00:11:10,317
And get back here
in half an hour.

289
00:11:10,384 --> 00:11:11,451
Who's that?

290
00:11:11,517 --> 00:11:12,484
He's our supervisor.

291
00:11:12,551 --> 00:11:13,850
We weren't supposed
to work today.

292
00:11:13,917 --> 00:11:15,517
We're having trouble
getting ahold of him.

293
00:11:15,584 --> 00:11:17,917
But we need more eyes.

294
00:11:17,983 --> 00:11:21,084
The note doesn't say that
he'll kill jeffrey today,

295
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:24,184
It says, "if not today,
tomorrow or the next day."

296
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,651
Let's say he gets home safe.

297
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,983
How long will you all
be around to make sure he's ok?

298
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,250
Let's just
get through today.

I need you to listen
really carefully.

Something's happened
to hotch.

310
00:14:05,217 --> 00:14:06,217
What do you mean, something?

311
00:14:06,284 --> 00:14:07,517
I don't know.

312
00:14:07,584 --> 00:14:09,818
I'm in his place.
he's not here,
but there's blood.

313

Oh, my god.

314
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:11,917
I need you to send police

315

right away.

I don't know.
someone took him?

00:14:20,883 --> 00:14:22,551
There's blood, but i can't
be sure whose it is.

321
00:14:22,617 --> 00:14:23,818
Just get people here.

322
00:14:23,883 --> 00:14:24,983
Ok, i'm sending an army.

323
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:26,451
Garcia, i'm gonna
have to tell reid

324
00:14:26,517 --> 00:14:27,983
Because he's expecting
me back,

325
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:29,384
But you can't tell the others.

326
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:30,784
They cannot be distracted.

327
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,950
Ok. ok.

00:14:36,451 --> 00:14:37,751
Hey.

330
00:14:37,818 --> 00:14:39,417
What?

331
00:14:39,484 --> 00:14:42,050
What--what are you
talking about?

332
00:14:42,117 --> 00:14:44,584
What's going on?

333
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:45,751
Is this about jeffrey?

334
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:47,384
No, no, it's unrelated.

335
00:14:47,451 --> 00:14:48,917
We only have a few hours
left here.

336
00:14:48,983 --> 00:14:50,718
I'm really sorry,
i have to take
this phone call, ok?

337
00:14:50,784 --> 00:14:52,917
What could be more important
than my son right now?

338
00:14:52,983 --> 00:14:56,150
I assure you,
this will take one second.
please, i promise.

339
00:14:56,217 --> 00:14:57,250
Fine.

340
00:14:57,317 --> 00:14:58,784
There's a huge hole
in the wall.

341
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:02,617
Probably a .44,
but there's no blood
or tissue spray around it.

342
00:15:02,684 --> 00:15:03,950
Any idea how he got out?

343
00:15:04,017 --> 00:15:06,184
If he was shot,
there are no drag marks.

344
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,850
But a body could have
been wrapped in something.

345

are on the way?

346
00:15:09,484 --> 00:15:10,684

347
00:15:10,751 --> 00:15:12,284
All right, um, write down
everything you see

348
00:15:12,351 --> 00:15:13,983
And we'll profile
from your notes
when you get back.

349
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,417
How's dr. barton?

350
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:19,584
It's a huge list of cases
to go through with him.

351
00:15:19,651 --> 00:15:23,184
Ok, don't worry about
here. i've got this.
just stay focused.

352
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,551
All right. you, too.

353
00:15:28,117 --> 00:15:30,050
Uh, dr. barton?

354
00:15:30,117 --> 00:15:32,050
Sorry about that.

355
00:15:32,117 --> 00:15:34,883
Agent prentiss has been
called away on an emergency.

356
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,150
You gotta be kidding me.

357
00:15:36,217 --> 00:15:37,718
I'm confident
that the two of us

358
00:15:37,784 --> 00:15:39,184
Can do this together
right now. all right?

359
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,317
We know he's been
killing hispanic males
as surrogates.

360
00:15:42,384 --> 00:15:43,551
Did you separate
the case files?

361
00:15:43,617 --> 00:15:44,551
Yeah.

362
00:15:44,617 --> 00:15:45,883
All right, how many
of the surgeries

363
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,217
Fit the criteria?

364
00:15:47,284 --> 00:15:48,551
Um, 82.

365
00:15:48,617 --> 00:15:50,050
All right.
now let me ask you this.

366
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:51,217
On how many of those dates

367
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,917
Did you operate
on somebody else as well?

368
00:15:53,983 --> 00:15:55,751
75.

369
00:15:55,818 --> 00:15:58,684
Did any of those patients
die on the table?

370
00:15:58,751 --> 00:16:01,818
10. um, no, wait. 11.

371
00:16:01,883 --> 00:16:03,217
11. that's where we start.

372
00:16:03,284 --> 00:16:04,784
This whole thing
is about choice.

373
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:07,184
He's forcing you
to play god with your son

374
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,517
Because the last time
you had a choice,

375
00:16:08,584 --> 00:16:10,451
Your decision
devastated him.

376
00:16:10,517 --> 00:16:12,317
I'm a doctor.
i save people.

377
00:16:12,384 --> 00:16:14,184
It doesn't matter to him.
all that matters to him

378
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,451
Is that you had
an alternative

379
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:16,684
And you didn't take it.

380
00:16:16,751 --> 00:16:18,017
Now, how many
of those surgeries

381
00:16:18,084 --> 00:16:19,317
Involve patients under 20?

382
00:16:19,384 --> 00:16:21,017
Uh...6.

383
00:16:21,084 --> 00:16:22,917
We get a lot of shootings,
mostly gang related.

384
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:25,850
Has a gang member or family
member ever threatened you?

385
00:16:25,917 --> 00:16:27,784
No, uh, at first
when you lose someone

386
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,850
It's mostly confusion
and devastation.

387
00:16:29,917 --> 00:16:31,451
The anger comes later.

388
00:16:31,517 --> 00:16:33,417
All right, we have 6 dates
where you operated

389
00:16:33,484 --> 00:16:36,250
On an hispanic male
on the same night
a patient under 20 died.

390
00:16:36,317 --> 00:16:38,351
What i'm gonna do
is i'm gonna read
the names and dates

391
00:16:38,417 --> 00:16:41,084
And you tell me anything
you can remember, ok?

392
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,284
Ok.

393
00:16:42,351 --> 00:16:45,584
All right, let's start
with january 22nd.

394
00:16:45,651 --> 00:16:49,117
Tyler hayes,
multiple gunshot wounds.

395
00:16:51,551 --> 00:16:54,250
February 13th,
brian douglas,

396
00:16:54,317 --> 00:16:57,351
Hit-and-run victim,
lacerated aorta.

397
00:17:03,917 --> 00:17:05,017
No.

398
00:17:05,084 --> 00:17:07,484
March 15th,
devon marks,

399
00:17:07,551 --> 00:17:08,517
Heroin overdose.

400
00:17:08,584 --> 00:17:10,017
Angela harris,
another car accident,

401
00:17:10,084 --> 00:17:13,417
Single vehicle,
bleeding into her brain.

402
00:17:18,684 --> 00:17:20,184
I...this is no use.

403
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,084
I would remember
if i was threatened.

404
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:24,317
Did any of them ask you
about your family?

405
00:17:26,484 --> 00:17:28,084
We have time.

406
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,850
[clock ticking]

407
00:17:29,917 --> 00:17:31,584
Ok.

408
00:17:35,584 --> 00:17:37,317
I talked
to detective walker.

409
00:17:37,384 --> 00:17:39,950
Final bell's at 3:10.
he's gonna have
a s.w.a.t. unit

410
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,384
In place at exactly 3:00
to escort kids out.

411
00:17:42,451 --> 00:17:45,217
We'll need you to gather
the students at 2:45.

412
00:17:45,284 --> 00:17:46,551
This could all
be happening now.

413
00:17:46,617 --> 00:17:48,617
If the unsub sees us
evacuate early,

414
00:17:48,684 --> 00:17:51,184
We feel certain
he'll kill another
random citizen.

415
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,950
And this also buys us a day
to try and discover
his identity.

416
00:17:54,017 --> 00:17:55,551
So we'll have school buses
for evacuation.

417
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:58,551
Teachers can brief parents
who are here to pick up
their kids.

418
00:17:58,617 --> 00:18:01,517
The key is to keep jeffrey
isolated and avoid panic
with the other students.

419
00:18:01,584 --> 00:18:04,317
If we can do that,
everybody gets out
of here safe.

420
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:06,917
Have you cross-checked
all the records of
employees in the building

421
00:18:06,983 --> 00:18:08,584
Against dr. barton?

422
00:18:08,651 --> 00:18:09,983
Garcia's on it.

423
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,317
Emily.
[telephone rings]

424
00:18:11,384 --> 00:18:13,818
No. sorry, baby girl,
just little old me.

425
00:18:13,883 --> 00:18:15,217
You're out of luck.

426
00:18:15,284 --> 00:18:16,850
Right. sorry.

427
00:18:16,917 --> 00:18:19,718
Did you finish
the background check
on everyone in the building?

428
00:18:19,784 --> 00:18:22,718
Yeah. uh, no red flags,
no felonies,
no connection to barton.

429
00:18:22,784 --> 00:18:25,384
Ok, well, that's good.

430
00:18:26,784 --> 00:18:28,983
All right, listen, i gotta go.
there's about to be a bell.

431
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,684
All right. be safe.

432
00:18:30,751 --> 00:18:32,818
Hey. everything ok?

433
00:18:32,883 --> 00:18:34,184
Yeah. oh, yeah,
i'm just tired.

434
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,584
Yeah, i hear you.

435
00:18:35,651 --> 00:18:37,651
Let's just get this kid
home safe and we can all sleep.

436
00:18:37,718 --> 00:18:39,551
Right.

437
00:18:39,617 --> 00:18:42,850
[school bell rings]

438
00:18:42,917 --> 00:18:46,983
[overlapping chatter]

439
00:19:01,651 --> 00:19:02,651
Excuse me.

440
00:19:02,718 --> 00:19:05,017
I'm supposed to meet
with principal findlay.

441
00:19:05,084 --> 00:19:07,351
Can you tell me where
her office is?

442
00:19:13,784 --> 00:19:15,017
Georgetown hospital.

443
00:19:15,084 --> 00:19:18,217
Hi. my name's
penelope garcia.
i'm from the fbi.

444
00:19:18,284 --> 00:19:19,950
I was calling to see
if an agent aaron hotchner

445
00:19:20,017 --> 00:19:22,017
Had been admitted
to the emergency room?

446
00:19:22,084 --> 00:19:23,684
Supervisory special agent
aaron hotchner.

447
00:19:23,751 --> 00:19:25,250
Hotchner, aaron.

448
00:19:25,317 --> 00:19:28,117
I wanted to see if he
had been admitted or if...

449
00:19:28,184 --> 00:19:30,551
Yeah, he's an fbi agent.

450
00:19:30,617 --> 00:19:32,684
What...

451
00:19:32,751 --> 00:19:34,551
When was that?

452
00:19:36,117 --> 00:19:38,517
Ok. thank you.

453
00:19:38,584 --> 00:19:40,317
Oh, my god.

454
00:19:41,217 --> 00:19:43,751
[cell phone rings]

455
00:19:43,818 --> 00:19:45,184
Talk to me, garcia.

456
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,250
Ok, i--i called hospitals
to see if hotch

457
00:19:47,317 --> 00:19:49,484
Had gotten himself admitted
to an emergency room.

458
00:19:49,551 --> 00:19:50,617
And?

459
00:19:50,684 --> 00:19:51,883
He's not listed as a patient,

460
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,617
But someone dropped
a john doe off

461
00:19:53,684 --> 00:19:55,184
At st. sebastian hospital,

462
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,818
And that someone's name
was fbi agent derek morgan.

463
00:19:57,883 --> 00:19:59,917
It doesn't make sense.

464
00:19:59,983 --> 00:20:02,818
I know. do you think
they got their
credentials mixed up?

465
00:20:04,117 --> 00:20:05,484
The reaper.

466
00:20:06,617 --> 00:20:08,983
Foyet took morgan's creds.

467
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:10,684
Why would he drop him off
at the e.r.?

468
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,684
What hospital did you say
again?

469
00:20:12,751 --> 00:20:13,917
St. sebastian hospital.

470
00:20:13,983 --> 00:20:15,784
I'll call you with an update
when i get there.

471
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,351
Yeah.

472
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:18,718
I don't understand.

473
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:20,651
These surgeries
are all hours apart.

474
00:20:20,718 --> 00:20:22,651
I didn't have to choose
between patients.

475
00:20:22,718 --> 00:20:26,050
If he's punishing me
for my choices,
none of these fit.

476
00:20:26,117 --> 00:20:27,417
All right,
look at the note again

477
00:20:27,484 --> 00:20:29,584
And compare against
the wording on the charts.

478
00:20:29,651 --> 00:20:31,950
A lot of times an unsub
will unconsciously mirror

479
00:20:32,017 --> 00:20:34,117
The wording of situations.

480
00:20:55,184 --> 00:20:56,584
You remember something?

481
00:20:56,651 --> 00:20:59,983
Uh, i don't know.
it was right after new year's.

482
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,651
There was a car accident.

483
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:03,484
One of the victims
was hispanic.

484
00:21:03,551 --> 00:21:05,917
New year's...

485
00:21:05,983 --> 00:21:07,651
Um...

486
00:21:07,718 --> 00:21:09,351
January 3rd,
there's a 2-car collision,

487
00:21:09,417 --> 00:21:11,484
You operated on
a hector ledezma.

488
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,584
That was your only
surgery that night.

489
00:21:13,651 --> 00:21:15,150
Mrs. ledezma?

490
00:21:15,217 --> 00:21:16,551
The collision
lacerated his kidney.

491
00:21:16,617 --> 00:21:18,217
He lost a lot of blood.

492
00:21:18,284 --> 00:21:20,584
But we were able
to repair the damage.

493
00:21:20,651 --> 00:21:23,417
So, it'll take some time,
but he'll be just fine.

494
00:21:23,484 --> 00:21:25,351
What about my son?

495
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:26,451
I'm sorry?

496
00:21:26,517 --> 00:21:28,384
Jason meyers. he's 18.

497
00:21:28,451 --> 00:21:30,284
He was in the accident.

498
00:21:34,317 --> 00:21:36,217
Your son was dead
when he arrived here.

499
00:21:37,818 --> 00:21:41,818
That's because i didn't
operate on the boy.

500
00:21:44,417 --> 00:21:45,818
They told me he's breathing.

501
00:21:45,883 --> 00:21:47,351
He's been put
on life support.

502
00:21:47,417 --> 00:21:51,684
But, um...
i'm afraid he no longer
has brain function.

503
00:21:51,751 --> 00:21:52,818
I'm very sorry.

504
00:21:52,883 --> 00:21:54,950
You're not even
gonna operate.

505
00:21:55,017 --> 00:21:56,284
It's too late.

506
00:21:56,351 --> 00:21:57,517
You don't even know
who he was.

507
00:21:57,584 --> 00:21:59,384
She had to give you
the chart.

508
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:00,917
I'm sorry.

509
00:22:00,983 --> 00:22:03,417
Do you have children?

510
00:22:03,484 --> 00:22:04,451
A son.

511
00:22:04,517 --> 00:22:06,150
What would you say
to a doctor

512
00:22:06,217 --> 00:22:07,784
Who wouldn't even try
to save him?

513
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:10,484
I'm sorry. i know
it's hard to understand,
believe me,

514
00:22:10,551 --> 00:22:13,117
But there is nothing
i can do.

515
00:22:21,017 --> 00:22:23,050
Garcia, i need you to find
a patient in the system

516
00:22:23,117 --> 00:22:24,718
Named jason meyers.

517
00:22:25,818 --> 00:22:28,117
He was admitted january 3rd,

518
00:22:28,184 --> 00:22:29,584
On life support.

519
00:22:29,651 --> 00:22:30,983
Oh, no.

520
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,084
What?

521
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,584
He was taken off the ventilator

522
00:22:33,651 --> 00:22:35,584
And declared legally dead
3 days ago.

523
00:22:35,651 --> 00:22:36,718
Who's his father?

524
00:22:36,784 --> 00:22:39,751
Yeah, uh, patrick meyers,
age 45.

525
00:22:39,818 --> 00:22:40,883
Get a photo into the school
immediately.

526
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,250
I think he's our unsub.

527
00:22:42,317 --> 00:22:44,651
Ok. yeah.
it's on its way.

528
00:22:45,983 --> 00:22:48,584
He was stabbed 9 times,
but no major arteries were hit.

529
00:22:48,651 --> 00:22:50,917
It's a miracle
he's alive.

530
00:22:50,983 --> 00:22:52,584
When will he wake up?

531
00:22:52,651 --> 00:22:55,317
The anesthesia should wear off
within the hour.

532
00:22:55,384 --> 00:22:56,850
But he's bound to be
out of it.

533
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:58,084
Ok.

534
00:22:59,751 --> 00:23:01,850
May i stay here?

535
00:23:01,917 --> 00:23:02,850
Of course.

536
00:23:02,917 --> 00:23:04,517
Thank you.

537
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:27,684
[indistinct instructions]

538
00:23:31,417 --> 00:23:34,317
Don't worry. as soon as
the building's clear,

539
00:23:34,384 --> 00:23:37,217
You're gonna get
your own escort out of here.

540
00:23:47,818 --> 00:23:49,883
Come on, no pushing.
one at a time.

541
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,084
Let's keep it moving.

542
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:58,417
Nice and orderly.

543
00:23:58,484 --> 00:24:00,017
This abbreviation
right here, l.c.,

544
00:24:00,084 --> 00:24:02,551
What does that
stand for?

545
00:24:06,451 --> 00:24:08,184
[clears throat]

546
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,351
Where are you going?

547
00:24:09,417 --> 00:24:11,017
The note says not to deviate
from my routine,

548
00:24:11,084 --> 00:24:13,017
And i always pick up
jeffrey on my days off.

549
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:15,050
I'm gonna come with you.

550
00:24:15,117 --> 00:24:17,883
[cell phone rings]

551
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,184
Yeah.

552
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,718
L.c. on the unsub's note.

553
00:24:20,784 --> 00:24:22,517
It stands for "living children."

554
00:24:22,584 --> 00:24:23,584
Are you sure?

555
00:24:23,651 --> 00:24:25,317
It's administrative.
it's when they're afraid

556
00:24:25,384 --> 00:24:26,651
A patient's gonna go
on life support

557
00:24:26,718 --> 00:24:28,484
And they don't have
a dnr order.

558
00:24:29,584 --> 00:24:30,684
Reid?

559
00:24:30,751 --> 00:24:33,217
What if the unsub was
trying to tell dr. barton

560
00:24:33,284 --> 00:24:34,718
That he is actually
the target

561
00:24:34,784 --> 00:24:38,317
And that he's gonna
leave his son
without a father?

562
00:24:39,184 --> 00:24:40,117
[door opens]

563
00:24:40,184 --> 00:24:41,617
Barton!

564
00:24:43,684 --> 00:24:45,484
Doctor!

565
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:50,917
Uhh!

566
00:24:50,983 --> 00:24:52,417
Reid?

567
00:24:52,484 --> 00:24:54,017
Answer me.

568
00:24:54,084 --> 00:24:54,984
Reid?

569
00:24:58,084 --> 00:25:00,517
This is special agent
emily prentiss from the fbi.

570
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:01,884
I need police
and an ambulance

571
00:25:01,891 --> 00:25:05,184
To 120 kensington road,
mclean, virginia.

572
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:09,451
Shots fired,
federal agent possibly down.

573
00:25:09,517 --> 00:25:11,084
are you hit?
No.

574
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:12,217
Get my gun. my gun.

575
00:25:12,284 --> 00:25:13,983
Get away from him!
get away from him.

576
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:15,217
Whatever you do, stay down.

577
00:25:15,284 --> 00:25:16,751
Drop the gun!
don't protect him.

578
00:25:16,818 --> 00:25:19,084
He killed my son!

579
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,983
He did not kill your son.
your son was killed
by a car accident.

580
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:21,917
Stand up!

581
00:25:21,983 --> 00:25:23,117
I'm gonna ask you again,

582
00:25:23,184 --> 00:25:24,517
I do not want to shoot you,

583
00:25:24,584 --> 00:25:26,417
Please drop the gun.

584
00:25:26,484 --> 00:25:27,751
Stand up, you coward!

585
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:30,017
Mr. meyers, listen to me.

586
00:25:30,084 --> 00:25:32,384
All right, it's over.

587
00:25:32,451 --> 00:25:35,250
Dr. barton
did not kill your son.

588
00:25:35,317 --> 00:25:39,184
Your son was killed
by a car.

589
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:40,917
And this is not
what he would want.

590
00:25:40,983 --> 00:25:42,351
Ok?

591
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:44,184
So drop the gun.

592
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,584
Please.

593

[sirens]

594
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:54,351
Don't do it.

595
00:25:55,317 --> 00:25:58,317
I'm sorry.

596
00:26:02,818 --> 00:26:06,584
I'm fine. go to him.
go to him.

597
00:26:06,651 --> 00:26:09,017
Kick his gun away. make sure
his gun's not near him.

598
00:26:09,084 --> 00:26:11,184
No...no, don't touch me.

599
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:13,617
Oh, i want to die.

600
00:26:13,684 --> 00:26:15,517
Oh, don't touch me.

601
00:26:15,584 --> 00:26:18,184
I need to stop
the bleeding, ok?

602
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,484
Let me die.

603
00:26:19,551 --> 00:26:21,284
The medics are almost here.
can you keep him stabilized?

604
00:26:21,351 --> 00:26:23,351
Yes, i think so.

605
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:25,751
Hold on, hold on,
they're right here.

606
00:26:25,818 --> 00:26:27,250
Help is coming, all right?

607
00:26:27,317 --> 00:26:28,883
Hold on, hold on.

608
00:26:30,384 --> 00:26:32,751
We need a backboard
and a c-collar.

609
00:26:32,818 --> 00:26:35,017
Coming right up.

610
00:26:35,084 --> 00:26:37,784
Put pressure on this
right here.

611
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:39,718
Call ahead to the e.r.,
tell them they got a gsw

612
00:26:39,784 --> 00:26:43,150
To the thoracic cavity
and have him redlined
to the o.r. stat.

613
00:26:49,284 --> 00:26:52,017
Ohh...don't touch me.

614
00:26:52,084 --> 00:26:55,317
[sirens]

615
00:26:57,883 --> 00:27:00,084
Looks like it went
clean through.

616
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,551
You might have
just saved his life.

617
00:27:01,617 --> 00:27:03,384
Keep pressure on this, ok?

618
00:27:03,451 --> 00:27:07,150
I'm good, i'm fine.
go to your son.
i'm good. i'm fine. go.

619
00:27:07,217 --> 00:27:09,184
Jeffrey.

620
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,250
You ok?

621
00:27:10,317 --> 00:27:11,718
Reid: yeah, fine.

622
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,917
We'll get you
to a hospital.

623
00:27:14,983 --> 00:27:17,351
You need to find emily.
call emily.

624
00:27:17,417 --> 00:27:18,684
Where is she?

625
00:27:18,751 --> 00:27:21,484
Something's happened to hotch.

626
00:27:30,883 --> 00:27:32,584
He still isn't
conscious yet.

627
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,017
You sure it was foyet?

628
00:27:34,084 --> 00:27:35,684
He had morgan's
credentials.

629
00:27:35,751 --> 00:27:38,017
Did they catch him
on the security cam?

630
00:27:38,084 --> 00:27:39,150
You could see him
dropping hotch off,

631
00:27:39,217 --> 00:27:40,751
But the camera's
only on the entrance,

632
00:27:40,818 --> 00:27:43,517
So i have no idea
what direction he went
once he left the hospital.

633
00:27:43,584 --> 00:27:46,250
It doesn't make sense
for him to have brought
hotch to the e.r.

634
00:27:46,317 --> 00:27:49,050
Rossi: we know foyet gets off
on power and control.

635
00:27:49,117 --> 00:27:52,850
Maybe what he wants
is for hotch to know
his life was in his hands.

636
00:27:52,917 --> 00:27:54,617
He could do that
without risking
the hospital.

637
00:27:54,684 --> 00:27:56,117
Agents, he's waking up.

638
00:27:56,184 --> 00:27:59,217
Remember, he's weak.
don't push him.

639
00:28:10,317 --> 00:28:12,617
Where am i?

640
00:28:12,684 --> 00:28:14,217
In the hospital.

641
00:28:15,917 --> 00:28:18,284
How did i get here?

642
00:28:18,351 --> 00:28:20,584
Foyet drove you.

643
00:28:20,651 --> 00:28:22,917
Can you remember
what happened?

644
00:28:33,451 --> 00:28:36,150
You should have made
a deal.

645
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,250
What did he take?

646
00:28:40,317 --> 00:28:41,983
What do you mean?

647
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:43,751
The reaper always takes
something from his victims.

648
00:28:43,818 --> 00:28:45,351
Do we know what he took?

649
00:28:45,417 --> 00:28:47,850
There was a page missing
from your day planner

650
00:28:47,917 --> 00:28:51,050
In the address section,
the bs.

651
00:28:53,718 --> 00:28:55,484
What did he leave?

652
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:58,117
I don't know.

653
00:28:58,184 --> 00:29:00,751
He also leaves something
with his victims.

654
00:29:00,818 --> 00:29:02,384
I looked over
your whole apartment.

655
00:29:02,451 --> 00:29:03,850
Nothing felt out of place.

656
00:29:03,917 --> 00:29:05,950
Where are my clothes?

657
00:29:30,584 --> 00:29:32,950
Haley's maiden name
is brooks.

658
00:29:33,017 --> 00:29:36,917
I always listed her
in the bs in my
personal information

659
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:39,184
In case it fell into
the wrong hands.

660
00:29:41,384 --> 00:29:43,917
He knows where they live.

661
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:51,751
Haley's not answering.

662
00:29:51,817 --> 00:29:52,918
Garcia.

663
00:29:52,984 --> 00:29:54,150
Right here.

664
00:29:54,217 --> 00:29:55,517
I need fbi s.w.a.t. deployed
to hotch's old address.

665
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,751
Do it now.

666
00:29:56,817 --> 00:29:58,751
Oh, god, do you think
he's going after haley and jack?

667
00:29:58,817 --> 00:30:00,217
I don't know.
just send a s.w.a.t. team.

668
00:30:00,284 --> 00:30:02,284
Tell them to wait
for instructions.
we're on our way.

669
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,484
Consider them there.

670
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:05,150
We need to be prepared
for what we might find.

671
00:30:05,217 --> 00:30:08,450
Foyet kept hotch alive.
he wouldn't do that
without a reason.

672
00:30:24,851 --> 00:30:27,350
You should have
made a deal.

674
00:30:32,551 --> 00:30:34,551
Is this part
of my profile--

675
00:30:34,617 --> 00:30:36,150
You can't show me fear?

676
00:30:36,217 --> 00:30:39,250
If you don't see fear,
maybe it's because
i'm not afraid of you.

677
00:30:39,317 --> 00:30:41,684
You said that like
you actually meant it.

678

How's my friend
agent morgan?

679
00:30:44,751 --> 00:30:47,450
Are you here to kill me,
or are you here to play games?

680
00:30:47,517 --> 00:30:49,484
You tell me.

681
00:30:49,551 --> 00:30:51,183
Enlighten me
about my behavior.

682
00:31:04,884 --> 00:31:07,450
So tell me,

683
00:31:07,517 --> 00:31:10,117
Would i use this?

I'm ok.

I'm gonna need you
to step out of the room.

693

Breathe in slowly.

And exhale.

00:32:49,484 --> 00:32:50,517
What are you doing here?

702
00:32:50,584 --> 00:32:52,117
It's ok.
everything's ok.

703
00:32:52,183 --> 00:32:53,484
We got her.

704
00:32:53,551 --> 00:32:54,951
What's going on?

705
00:32:55,018 --> 00:32:56,317
Is there anyone else
in the house?

706
00:32:56,384 --> 00:32:57,684
No, there's no one here.

707
00:32:57,751 --> 00:32:59,117
Haley, where's jack?

708
00:32:59,183 --> 00:33:01,751
He's at a friend's house
for a play date.

709
00:33:01,817 --> 00:33:03,484
We need to get him
back here.

710
00:33:03,551 --> 00:33:04,784
We'll explain everything.

711
00:33:04,851 --> 00:33:06,350
Where's aaron?

712
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:07,884
He's in the hospital.

713
00:33:07,951 --> 00:33:09,083
What?

714
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:10,384
Haley, please.

715
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:12,884
Call for jack. tell them
i'm on the way to pick him up.

716
00:33:12,951 --> 00:33:14,784
I promise you we'll explain.

717
00:33:14,851 --> 00:33:16,317
Call for him right now.

718
00:33:16,384 --> 00:33:18,417
Text me the address.

719
00:33:18,484 --> 00:33:20,851
Tell me what happened
to aaron.

720
00:33:25,951 --> 00:33:27,217
They will kill you.

721
00:33:27,284 --> 00:33:28,384
Shh.

722
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:29,884
Don't speak.

723
00:33:29,951 --> 00:33:32,717
You lost
a lot of blood.

724
00:33:32,784 --> 00:33:34,817
You'll need your oxygen.

725
00:33:34,884 --> 00:33:38,817
Do you know how much
you have to study
the human body

726
00:33:38,884 --> 00:33:42,250
To stab yourself
repeatedly and not die?

727
00:33:43,651 --> 00:33:48,450
I don't want to brag,
but i'm somewhat
of an expert.

728
00:33:48,517 --> 00:33:50,951
[groans]

729
00:33:54,951 --> 00:33:57,551
Do you want to see
my scars?

730
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:21,183
What do you think?

731
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:23,150
You like 'em?

732
00:34:23,217 --> 00:34:24,417
Huh?

733
00:34:24,484 --> 00:34:27,117
Yours are gonna look
just the same.

734
00:34:27,183 --> 00:34:28,317
My team...

735
00:34:28,384 --> 00:34:29,651
Your team.

736
00:34:29,717 --> 00:34:33,150
Your team didn't catch me
until i wanted them to.

737
00:34:33,217 --> 00:34:35,217
You're not in charge,
so don't be foolish.

738
00:34:35,284 --> 00:34:37,417
Now try to relax.

739
00:34:38,817 --> 00:34:42,350
Your body will go numb.

740
00:34:42,417 --> 00:34:44,183
[groans]

741
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:47,018
And it goes in
so much easier...

742
00:34:47,083 --> 00:34:48,617
If you relax.

743
00:34:50,117 --> 00:34:52,384
The hard part

744
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:55,083
Is not passing out
from the pain.

745
00:34:58,083 --> 00:35:01,284
Now, i understand
that profilers think

746
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:04,417
That stabbing is a substitution
for the act of sex.

747
00:35:04,484 --> 00:35:06,417
That if somebody's impotent,

748
00:35:06,484 --> 00:35:10,717
They'll use a knife instead.

749
00:35:10,784 --> 00:35:13,083
Is that what you think,
agent hotchner?

750
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:16,584
Maybe this will change
the way that you profile.

751
00:35:16,651 --> 00:35:19,717
[groans]

752
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:22,717
[cell phone rings]

753
00:35:23,918 --> 00:35:25,551
They're safe.

754
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:30,717
Is this really necessary?

755
00:35:30,784 --> 00:35:32,117
I'm afraid so.

756
00:35:32,183 --> 00:35:33,817
For how long?

757
00:35:33,884 --> 00:35:36,050
Rossi: i don't know.

758
00:35:36,117 --> 00:35:37,717
Mommy!

759
00:35:38,851 --> 00:35:42,517
They let me turn on
the siren!

760
00:35:42,584 --> 00:35:44,584
Wow, that's so great, baby!
did you have fun?

761
00:35:44,651 --> 00:35:46,584
Ohh...

762
00:35:46,651 --> 00:35:48,517
I'll help start a bag
in jack's room.

763
00:35:48,584 --> 00:35:49,551
Ok.

764
00:35:49,617 --> 00:35:51,918
How many times
did you run it?

765
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:54,851
How many times? 3?

766
00:35:55,817 --> 00:35:58,284
You were at my place,
right?

767
00:35:58,350 --> 00:35:59,918
Could you tell
how he got in?

768
00:35:59,984 --> 00:36:02,317
I'm not sure.

769
00:36:03,484 --> 00:36:06,317
Do you want to talk
about what happened?

770
00:36:11,784 --> 00:36:13,417
I don't know.

771
00:36:13,484 --> 00:36:18,317
After he stabbed me
the first time,
it all goes blank.

772
00:36:25,884 --> 00:36:27,617
How do you feel?

773
00:36:27,684 --> 00:36:30,117
I'm gonna be ok.

774
00:36:30,183 --> 00:36:33,117
Did they explain to you
what's happening?

775
00:36:33,183 --> 00:36:35,584
They said the marshals service

776
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:38,183
Is taking us straight from here

777
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:40,617
And putting us into
protective custody.

778
00:36:40,684 --> 00:36:44,050
Haley, i'm sorry.

779
00:36:46,918 --> 00:36:49,150
Do you know where
they're gonna take us?

780
00:36:49,217 --> 00:36:50,484
No, i don't.

781
00:36:50,551 --> 00:36:52,384
And that's the point.

782
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:54,951
I can't know
where you're going.

783
00:36:55,018 --> 00:36:56,651
If you have any contact
with anyone,

784
00:36:56,717 --> 00:36:57,984
Then he could track you.

785
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:01,018
Jack has school.
he has friends.

786
00:37:01,083 --> 00:37:02,350
I have a job now.

787
00:37:02,417 --> 00:37:03,784
I know.

788
00:37:04,717 --> 00:37:06,250
And i'm sorry.

789
00:37:06,317 --> 00:37:08,417
We will catch him

790
00:37:08,484 --> 00:37:10,884
And you'll come back,

791
00:37:10,951 --> 00:37:13,384
And i promise
that i will spend
the rest of my life

792
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:15,584
Making this up to you.

793
00:37:18,217 --> 00:37:22,183
Are you sure
that we're in danger?

794
00:37:23,284 --> 00:37:25,584
Yes.

795
00:37:28,617 --> 00:37:31,450
And what about you?
are you gonna be safe?

796
00:37:31,517 --> 00:37:34,384
He wants to see me suffer.

797
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:36,317
Knowing that my son
is out there

798
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:39,751
And that i can't see him
is better than killing me.

799
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:44,018
What am i supposed to say
to jack?

800
00:37:44,083 --> 00:37:45,851
Tell him it's a vacation

801
00:37:45,918 --> 00:37:48,784
And that it's not gonna be
for very long.

802
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:59,350
How am i supposed
to keep him safe

803
00:37:59,417 --> 00:38:02,384
If there is no one i know
to help me?

804
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:04,083
Haley, you're strong.

805
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:06,350
You lived with me
in this job,

806
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:08,951
And you've practically
raised jack
all by yourself.

807
00:38:09,018 --> 00:38:10,517
You're a great mother.

808
00:38:20,984 --> 00:38:22,918
Can you catch this man?

809
00:38:22,984 --> 00:38:26,551
I will catch this man.

810
00:38:30,784 --> 00:38:32,884
Jack wants to come in.

811
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:36,384
I want to see him, too.

812
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:38,050
I just don't think
it's a good idea.

813
00:38:38,117 --> 00:38:41,384
Look, i know you're
trying to protect him.

814
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:44,450
But you both need this.

815
00:38:44,517 --> 00:38:46,717
Please.

816
00:38:47,751 --> 00:38:50,050
Ok.

817
00:38:56,317 --> 00:38:58,951
[groans]

818
00:39:01,617 --> 00:39:03,250
Hey, buddy.

819
00:39:03,317 --> 00:39:05,918
Come on in.

820
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:07,183
All right.

821
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:09,817
Ohh!

822
00:39:10,918 --> 00:39:12,918
Don't worry. it's ok.

823
00:39:12,984 --> 00:39:18,350
The doctors made sure
that i'm completely fine.

824
00:39:18,417 --> 00:39:21,450
Did mommy tell you
that you two
are gonna take a trip?

825
00:39:21,517 --> 00:39:23,751
Yeah.

826
00:39:23,817 --> 00:39:25,751
So i'm not gonna
see you for a while.

827
00:39:25,817 --> 00:39:28,350
Why?

828
00:39:28,417 --> 00:39:31,417
Well, think about it
like when daddy
goes away for work.

829
00:39:31,484 --> 00:39:34,651
Only this time you and mommy
get to go someplace.

830
00:39:34,717 --> 00:39:38,050
But what do i tell you
every time i go away?

831
00:39:38,117 --> 00:39:39,551
You love me.

832
00:39:39,617 --> 00:39:42,350
More than anything
in the world.

833
00:39:42,417 --> 00:39:44,584
Are you ok?

834
00:39:50,417 --> 00:39:52,918
I'm very proud of you.

835
00:39:52,984 --> 00:39:54,817
Every single day.

836
00:40:03,751 --> 00:40:05,384
I'll see you soon, ok?

837
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:07,217
Ok.

838
00:40:07,284 --> 00:40:09,384
You take care
of mom, ok?

839
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:11,317
Ok.

840
00:40:18,018 --> 00:40:19,617
I know aaron's worried.

841
00:40:19,684 --> 00:40:22,617
Tell him i'll protect them
like they're my own.

842
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:34,417
I just talked to spence.
he's gonna be fine.

843
00:40:34,484 --> 00:40:36,083
He's gonna have to be
on crutches for a while,

844
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:39,117
But he said kicking down doors
is morgan's job, anyway.

845
00:40:41,117 --> 00:40:43,317
You know, foyet having
your credentials

846
00:40:43,384 --> 00:40:45,651
Had nothing to do
with any of this.

847
00:40:45,717 --> 00:40:47,584
It was just his way
of trying to torture you.

848
00:40:47,651 --> 00:40:49,684
Yeah, i know.

849
00:40:49,751 --> 00:40:51,517
Foyet's about
power and control.

850
00:40:51,584 --> 00:40:54,517
He was hoping to watch
me fall apart, and...

851
00:40:54,584 --> 00:40:56,684
Now he wants
to destroy hotch.

852
00:40:56,751 --> 00:40:57,817
Prentiss: exactly.

853
00:40:57,884 --> 00:40:59,350
That's his plan,

854
00:40:59,417 --> 00:41:01,317
And now we fight it.

855
00:41:33,551 --> 00:41:36,150
Did you hear what happened
this morning?

856
00:41:36,217 --> 00:41:38,450
No.

857
00:41:38,517 --> 00:41:41,918
We had a situation.

858
00:41:41,984 --> 00:41:43,951
Unsub had already
killed 2 people.

859
00:41:44,018 --> 00:41:45,951
Said he was gonna
keep killing

860
00:41:46,018 --> 00:41:49,951
Unless a man used his son
as bait.

861
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:52,484
What happened?

862
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:55,217
We kept the boy safe.

863
00:41:55,284 --> 00:41:56,717
Worked the profile.

864
00:41:56,784 --> 00:41:58,884
It was a happy ending.

865
00:42:01,417 --> 00:42:03,684
Do you know why
i'm telling you this?

866
00:42:03,751 --> 00:42:05,984
Yes.

867
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:08,117
No other group
in the world

868
00:42:08,183 --> 00:42:10,250
Could have pulled off
what your team did

869
00:42:10,317 --> 00:42:11,450
In a matter of hours.

870
00:42:11,517 --> 00:42:15,217
I appreciate what
you're trying to do, dave.

871
00:42:15,284 --> 00:42:16,918
We'll get foyet.

872
00:42:16,984 --> 00:42:19,584
I promised haley
that we would get him,

873
00:42:19,651 --> 00:42:21,083
But the truth is,
if he stops killing,

874
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:23,083
We have no way
of tracking him.

875
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:25,617
He stopped killing
for 10 years
just for the pleasure

876
00:42:25,684 --> 00:42:29,018
Of watching shaunessy's
life fall apart.

877
00:42:36,018 --> 00:42:39,951
What's jack gonna remember
about me in 10 years?

878
00:42:40,018 --> 00:42:43,651
Hotch, look at me.

879
00:42:43,717 --> 00:42:47,018
I'm telling you,

880
00:42:47,083 --> 00:42:49,350
