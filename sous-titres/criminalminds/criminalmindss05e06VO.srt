1
00:00:02,868 --> 00:00:04,601
The bureau thinks
that my ability
to lead this team

2
00:00:04,667 --> 00:00:05,801
Has been compromised.

3
00:00:05,868 --> 00:00:08,300
I'm resigning as unit chief
at the end of the week.

4
00:00:08,367 --> 00:00:10,100
What?!
i'm not leaving the team.

5
00:00:10,167 --> 00:00:11,667
I'm just no longer
in charge.

6
00:00:11,734 --> 00:00:13,367
Me?
you are.

7
00:00:13,434 --> 00:00:16,133
Ms. barnes, i'm sorry for
your brother's death.

8
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,300
I know that sounds like
something people say,

9
00:00:18,367 --> 00:00:21,234
But i truly am sorry.

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,901
Thank you
for helping me
through this.

11
00:00:27,133 --> 00:00:28,634
Of course.

12
00:00:28,701 --> 00:00:31,300
I think you need
to cut contact
with tamara barnes.

13
00:00:31,367 --> 00:00:32,968
Penelope, she lost her brother.
she just wants answers.

14
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,300
I'm not involved.

15
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,567
Man: let's go.

16
00:02:00,901 --> 00:02:02,167
We have to hurry.

17
00:02:02,234 --> 00:02:03,100
We are.

18
00:02:03,167 --> 00:02:04,834
It's 10 minutes
before curfew.

19
00:02:04,901 --> 00:02:06,567
I'll get you there.

20
00:02:26,968 --> 00:02:28,567
What just happened
with ben?

21
00:02:28,634 --> 00:02:30,167
It was just a peck.

22
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:32,100
Only because you weren't alone,
but next time--

23
00:02:44,234 --> 00:02:46,834
So are you going to
text him tonight?

24
00:02:46,901 --> 00:02:47,834
Maybe.

25
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:48,868
Well, you should.

26
00:02:48,934 --> 00:02:50,968
I don't know. i have
homework to do still.

27
00:02:51,033 --> 00:02:52,167
So what?

28
00:02:52,234 --> 00:02:53,434
I guess he is
pretty cute.

29
00:02:53,501 --> 00:02:54,934
Um, yeah.

30
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,267
Aah!

31
00:02:58,334 --> 00:02:59,634
No! no! please!

32
00:02:59,701 --> 00:03:02,033
Stop! stop! aah!

33
00:03:10,633 --> 00:03:13,301
I don't know, it sounds like
a promotion to me.

34
00:03:13,368 --> 00:03:15,334
Well, yeah, it--

35
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:16,667
It's complicated.

36
00:03:16,734 --> 00:03:17,734
What isn't?

37
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,734
Hmm.

38
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,900
Yeah.

39
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:21,934
It's just everything's
happened so fast,

40
00:03:21,934 --> 00:03:23,567
I mean, we haven't
even had a chance

41
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:26,134
To tell the rest
of our team yet.

42
00:03:26,201 --> 00:03:29,600
You know, i wanted
to thank you again for...

43
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,434
Coming to the hearing.

44
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,034
I didn't know if it was
fair to ask you.

45
00:03:35,101 --> 00:03:37,500
Tamara, i'm glad i could
be there for you.

46
00:03:38,867 --> 00:03:42,368
I think that the only time
that i have felt sane at all

47
00:03:42,434 --> 00:03:46,600
In the past few weeks
is when i've talked to you.

48
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:48,633
Really? i...

49
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,600
I feel like i'm the one
who's been doing
all the talking here.

50
00:03:51,667 --> 00:03:54,633
You've helped me
reconnect to my job.

51
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,401
To myself, really.

52
00:03:56,468 --> 00:03:58,734
It's good to see you again.

53
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,767
It's really nice
to see you, too.

54
00:04:03,134 --> 00:04:04,900
So, listen,

55
00:04:04,967 --> 00:04:07,934
I know that your new job
is a lot of responsibility

56
00:04:08,001 --> 00:04:10,900
And you're gonna have to
commit a hundred percent,
and you should.

57
00:04:10,967 --> 00:04:12,834
But maybe when things
calm down,

58
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,600
I'll buy you a drink?
fair?

59
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:17,267
Yeah. it's more than fair.

60
00:04:17,334 --> 00:04:21,201
Also, i wanted
to give you something.

61
00:04:25,401 --> 00:04:27,101
It was william's.

62
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:28,500
I can't take this.

63
00:04:28,567 --> 00:04:30,401
I want you to have it.
please.

64
00:04:30,468 --> 00:04:32,101
For being there for me.

65
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:36,567
When you lose a brother
the way that i did,

66
00:04:36,633 --> 00:04:40,101
It's nice to have
someone like you at my side.

67
00:04:49,468 --> 00:04:52,967
So, did anyone explain
why hotch is stepping down?

68
00:04:53,034 --> 00:04:56,900
All morgan said this morning
is that it's happening.

69
00:04:56,967 --> 00:04:58,633
And it's business as usual.

70
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,700
So we're just supposed
to move forward
without any discussion?

71
00:05:01,767 --> 00:05:04,800
After foyet, i think
we'd have to be ready
for anything.

72
00:05:04,867 --> 00:05:06,234
Strauss:
did you pick a case?

73
00:05:06,301 --> 00:05:08,167
Agent jareau and i reviewed
the requests this morning,

74
00:05:08,234 --> 00:05:10,234
And i've decided
on oklahoma city.

75
00:05:10,301 --> 00:05:11,734
Why this one?

76
00:05:11,834 --> 00:05:13,234
Locals have more
evidentiary information

77
00:05:13,301 --> 00:05:14,401
In other priorities.

78
00:05:14,468 --> 00:05:15,667
This one, they have nothing.

79
00:05:15,734 --> 00:05:17,001
They need us the most.

80
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:18,368
Good.

81
00:05:18,434 --> 00:05:21,667
If that's all,
i'd like to gather the team.

82
00:05:21,734 --> 00:05:24,734
I'll be checking in.
i expect to be briefed.

83
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,834
Yes, ma'am.

84
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,401
If you need privacy,
please use my office.

85
00:05:27,468 --> 00:05:28,834
That's ok. we're done here.

86
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:28,967
And when we get back,
i'll clear everything out

87
00:05:30,401 --> 00:05:31,368
And it'll be all yours.

88
00:05:31,434 --> 00:05:33,067
Hotch, i don't want
your office.

89
00:05:33,134 --> 00:05:35,734
I agree with agent hotchner.
the team leader needs
a proper office.

90
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,934
All due respect,
ms. strauss,

91
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:38,067
But both of you
have trusted me

92
00:05:38,134 --> 00:05:39,368
To step in
as acting unit chief.

93
00:05:39,434 --> 00:05:41,001
I'm asking that you
respect my decision.

94
00:05:41,067 --> 00:05:42,734
I've decided that
i don't want hotch's office.

95
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,101
That's where he belongs.

96
00:05:44,167 --> 00:05:46,468
If necessary, we can discuss
this again at a later date,

97
00:05:46,533 --> 00:05:49,567
But right now, we really
need to get started
on this case.

98
00:05:49,633 --> 00:05:50,767
Guys.

99
00:05:50,834 --> 00:05:52,368
Grab rossi.

100
00:05:52,434 --> 00:05:54,934
This is megan chertow
and her friend
bina sukarto,

101
00:05:55,001 --> 00:05:58,633
Both 17, found 2 nights ago
in a parking garage,

102
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,301
Carotids severed.

103
00:06:00,368 --> 00:06:02,101
This is john o'heron, 61.

104
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:05,201
He was found dead
in a wooded area 4 days ago,

105
00:06:05,267 --> 00:06:06,533
Blunt force trauma
to the head.

106
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,034
Different m.o.

107
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,434
And completely different
victimology.

108
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,834
Rossi: how are
the cases linked?

109
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,468
Jj: their eyes
have been removed.

110
00:06:12,533 --> 00:06:13,767
Oh, he's an enucleator.

111
00:06:13,834 --> 00:06:14,967
There's a name for this?

112
00:06:15,034 --> 00:06:17,401
It's a rare subset
of criminal behavior,

113
00:06:17,468 --> 00:06:20,167
But there have been
case studies of
assaultive enucleators.

114
00:06:20,234 --> 00:06:23,734
The overwhelming majority
of them suffer from
diagnosed mental disorders.

115
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,167
Reid: and they're
usually males,

116
00:06:25,234 --> 00:06:26,234
Lack social skills,

117
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:27,700
Their kills are
disorganized and sloppy.

118
00:06:27,767 --> 00:06:29,834
The typical enucleator
gouges the eyes out,

119
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,667
But he doesn't normally
take them with him.

120
00:06:31,734 --> 00:06:32,800
This guy did?

121
00:06:32,867 --> 00:06:34,468
We need to figure out why.

122
00:06:34,533 --> 00:06:35,900
There are noticeable
shifts

123
00:06:35,967 --> 00:06:37,434
From the first
to second murder.

124
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,067
He goes from killing
in seclusion

125
00:06:39,134 --> 00:06:40,368
To a public place.

126
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:42,067
And he escalated
from one victim to 2.

127
00:06:42,134 --> 00:06:44,800
What concerns me most is
there's less than 48 hours

128
00:06:44,867 --> 00:06:47,334
Between the murders.
that's why i chose
this case.

129
00:06:47,401 --> 00:06:49,734
Hotch: and from what we know
about enucleators,

130
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,767
They're almost always
multiple repeat offenders.

131
00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:53,734
Exactly. which means
he's going to need
to kill again soon.

132
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,201
All right. let's meet
on the plane in 30.

133
00:07:12,967 --> 00:07:14,934
Aah!

134
00:07:38,368 --> 00:07:41,533
Sync by honeybunny

135
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:48,768
Morgan: "and if thy right eye
offend thee,

136
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:51,601
Pluck it out
and cast it from thee."

137
00:07:51,667 --> 00:07:54,100
Matthew 5:29.

138
00:07:54,167 --> 00:07:56,734
The color of all the victims'
eyes are different,

139
00:07:56,801 --> 00:07:58,401
So that probably doesn't
factor in to victimology.

140
00:07:58,467 --> 00:08:00,401
It's more likely what
he sees in the eyes.

141
00:08:00,467 --> 00:08:01,868
Case studies show
that most enucleators

142
00:08:01,933 --> 00:08:03,134
Suffer from delusions.

143
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,200
They hear voices
and see things
in people's eyes.

144
00:08:05,267 --> 00:08:06,501
Usually something evil.

145
00:08:06,567 --> 00:08:09,200
They're driven to enucleate
to destroy the devil.

146
00:08:09,267 --> 00:08:10,900
It points to someone who may
have been institutionalized

147
00:08:10,967 --> 00:08:12,033
And recently released.

148
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,467
I'll have garcia
start looking.

149
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,367
All right, so talk to me.

150
00:08:15,434 --> 00:08:17,234
What makes these attacks
so different?

151
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,734
With victim one, there were
multiple blunt force strikes
to the head--

152
00:08:19,801 --> 00:08:21,067
A more personal kill.

153
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:22,501
And he disposed of the body,

154
00:08:22,567 --> 00:08:24,434
Maybe as a forensic
countermeasure.

155
00:08:24,501 --> 00:08:26,434
The next murders seemed
less personal,

156
00:08:26,501 --> 00:08:27,567
More opportunistic.

157
00:08:27,634 --> 00:08:29,100
I think we need to look
at why the first victim

158
00:08:29,167 --> 00:08:30,234
Was bludgeoned and dumped.

159
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,267
Perhaps the unsub
knew him.

160
00:08:32,334 --> 00:08:34,768
Prentiss, i want you to go
to the disposal site,

161
00:08:34,834 --> 00:08:36,801
See if you can figure out
why he was dumped there.

162
00:08:36,868 --> 00:08:40,067
Rossi, you and i are
gonna go to last night's
crime scene.

163
00:08:40,134 --> 00:08:41,567
Actually, uh,
the girls' families

164
00:08:41,634 --> 00:08:43,467
Asked to speak
to our team leader.

165
00:08:48,167 --> 00:08:50,267
All right. um...

166
00:08:50,334 --> 00:08:53,434
Ok, in that case,
rossi, you can handle
the crime scene solo.

167
00:08:53,501 --> 00:08:55,634
Jj, you're with me,

168
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:56,701
And, hotch, reid,

169
00:08:56,768 --> 00:08:58,701
I want you to get into
john o'heron's life,

170
00:08:58,768 --> 00:09:02,334
See if anything at all
points to a personal motive.

171
00:09:06,467 --> 00:09:07,868
Hey. phil brantley.
appreciate you all coming.

172
00:09:07,933 --> 00:09:09,100
Agent hotchner.
this is dr. reid.

173
00:09:09,167 --> 00:09:11,167
You'll meet the rest
of the team later.

174
00:09:11,234 --> 00:09:12,300
Here's one.
excellent.

175
00:09:12,367 --> 00:09:14,033
Ok, here's where
the first body
was found,

176
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,267
Just outside
of town.

177
00:09:15,334 --> 00:09:17,601
And last night's
murders were here.

178
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:19,734
And that's about
22 miles apart.

179
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:21,967
What?
that's unusual.

180
00:09:22,033 --> 00:09:23,768
Serial killers usually have
a smaller kill zone.

181
00:09:23,834 --> 00:09:25,401
[cell phone rings]

182
00:09:25,467 --> 00:09:27,334
It's our technical analyst.

183
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:28,900
Hey, garcia,
you're on speaker phone.

184
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:33,067
So, i looked up recently
released mental health
patients

185
00:09:33,134 --> 00:09:35,234
Who have a history
of eye gouging,

186
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,234
Eye assault,
and other gross things

187
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,434
You can do to eyes
and sockets.

188
00:09:39,501 --> 00:09:39,567
And there's no bingo
for okie city residents.

189
00:09:41,933 --> 00:09:44,267
Any other recent attacks
involving assaults on eyes?

190
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:47,401
There's one 9 months ago.
he's not your guy
'cause he's in jail.

191
00:09:47,467 --> 00:09:48,801
We'll call you later.

192
00:09:48,868 --> 00:09:49,967
10-4, breaker breaker.

193
00:09:50,033 --> 00:09:51,234
Bye.

194
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,701
You think he's fresh out
of an asylum?

195
00:09:52,768 --> 00:09:55,167
Either that or he's been held
somewhere and he's now free.

196
00:09:55,234 --> 00:09:56,667
We've seen eye assaults
before,

197
00:09:56,734 --> 00:09:59,501
You know, bar brawls, rage,
domestic abuse cases.

198
00:09:59,567 --> 00:10:01,200
But nothing like this.

199
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,267
What the hell's
he doing with the eyes?

200
00:10:03,334 --> 00:10:05,701
He could be collecting them
as a trophy of some sort.

201
00:10:05,768 --> 00:10:07,567
Reid: they wouldn't
keep long as trophies.

202
00:10:07,634 --> 00:10:09,234
Eyes are 80% vitreous humor,

203
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,801
Which is essentially water.

204
00:10:10,868 --> 00:10:13,067
After a few hours, they begin
to get cloudy and wilt.

205
00:10:13,134 --> 00:10:14,601
Any other theories?

206
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:16,434
There have been cases
where after enucleation,

207
00:10:16,501 --> 00:10:19,567
Mental patients
have consumed the eyeballs.

208
00:10:19,634 --> 00:10:22,067
Are you serious?

209
00:10:48,033 --> 00:10:49,900
Thank you for coming here.

210
00:10:49,967 --> 00:10:51,234
It's no problem.

211
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:51,967
We can't leave our house.

212
00:10:52,033 --> 00:10:53,634
We have to mourn for 3 days.

213
00:10:53,701 --> 00:10:55,401
Buddhist rituals?

214
00:10:55,467 --> 00:10:57,234
Yes.

215
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,734
Did your sister call you

216
00:10:58,801 --> 00:11:00,567
While she was out
last night?

217
00:11:00,634 --> 00:11:02,067
No. i knew
something was wrong.

218
00:11:02,134 --> 00:11:04,567
She always comes home
by curfew.

219
00:11:04,634 --> 00:11:07,234
Does this man look
familiar to you?

220
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,967
No.

221
00:11:09,033 --> 00:11:10,434
Why do you ask?

222
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:11,933
We believe
he and your sister

223
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,467
Were killed
by the same person.

224
00:11:13,534 --> 00:11:15,933
It helps us to rule out
any connection
between the victims,

225
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,267
And it tells us
that your sister
was most likely

226
00:11:18,334 --> 00:11:19,634
Attacked at random.

227
00:11:22,634 --> 00:11:25,100
Oh, thank you.

228
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:26,801
Thank you.

229
00:11:28,234 --> 00:11:30,167
I asked to speak to you

230
00:11:30,234 --> 00:11:32,900
Because we need you
to do something for us.

231
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,868
[takes breath] mm.

232
00:11:41,933 --> 00:11:43,467
It's ok.

233
00:11:43,534 --> 00:11:45,834
Take your time.

234
00:11:47,467 --> 00:11:50,834
Grandma said she saw
bina's ghost last night.

235
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,933
Her eyes were just
big black holes.

236
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,834
Bina was looking
for her eyes.

237
00:12:05,467 --> 00:12:08,000
She says bina's cursed.

238
00:12:11,167 --> 00:12:12,534
She can't rest.

239
00:12:12,601 --> 00:12:14,933
She's stuck for eternity

240
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,768
Looking for her eyes.

241
00:12:17,834 --> 00:12:21,033
We want to cremate her.

242
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,200
But we need all of her.

243
00:12:28,334 --> 00:12:30,567
Can you find her eyes
for us?

244
00:12:30,634 --> 00:12:33,768
We will try.

245
00:12:33,834 --> 00:12:36,701
But realistically,
we may not be able to.

246
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,601
Then she will be cursed
forever.

247
00:12:45,267 --> 00:12:49,167
She may never rest in peace.

248
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:57,501
O'heron's friends say
he has a history
of drunken behavior,

249
00:12:57,567 --> 00:12:59,868
But they don't know anybody
with a grudge against him.

250
00:12:59,933 --> 00:13:01,067
He was last seen
leaving a bar.

251
00:13:01,134 --> 00:13:02,900
Bartender on duty said
he left without incident.

252
00:13:02,967 --> 00:13:04,567
Where did he go
after that?

253
00:13:04,634 --> 00:13:05,768
I checked out
the disposal site

254
00:13:05,834 --> 00:13:07,300
Where john o'heron's body
was dumped.

255
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:08,667
It's a remote farm road.

256
00:13:08,734 --> 00:13:10,868
The unsub didn't just
stumble on it, he knows it.

257
00:13:10,933 --> 00:13:11,900
We need a list of people

258
00:13:11,967 --> 00:13:13,100
Who work or live
near the area.

259
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,334
I got a bad feeling
about this guy.

260
00:13:15,401 --> 00:13:16,567
Why is that?

261
00:13:16,634 --> 00:13:18,100
He chose
that parking garage.

262
00:13:18,167 --> 00:13:19,267
He was patient.

263
00:13:19,334 --> 00:13:20,868
He hid and waited
for the right victims

264
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:22,601
And the right time
and place.

265
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:23,768
He blitzed them.

266
00:13:23,834 --> 00:13:25,734
It was all strategic.

267
00:13:25,801 --> 00:13:28,667
That sounds way too organized
for a typical enucleator.

268
00:13:28,734 --> 00:13:31,000
Add to that his lack
of a cooling-off period
between kills,

269
00:13:31,067 --> 00:13:32,768
It's not gonna be easy
to get ahead of him.

270
00:13:32,834 --> 00:13:34,200
I just got off the phone
with the m.e.

271
00:13:34,267 --> 00:13:36,967
She says there's
something we should see.

272
00:13:37,033 --> 00:13:38,801
The eyeball is held
in the socket

273
00:13:38,868 --> 00:13:40,900
By 6 different muscles,
fatty tissue,

274
00:13:40,967 --> 00:13:42,300
And the optic nerves.

275
00:13:42,367 --> 00:13:45,100
These are pictures of
john o'heron's eye sockets.

276
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:46,900
See the optic nerves
protruding?

277
00:13:46,967 --> 00:13:48,434
Trauma. they were ripped out.

278
00:13:48,501 --> 00:13:49,900
Maybe with fingers.

279
00:13:49,967 --> 00:13:52,567
Now compare this
to my body on the table.

280
00:13:52,634 --> 00:13:56,300
Smooth inside, no bruising,
no sign of trauma.

281
00:13:56,367 --> 00:13:59,501
Optic nerves retracted
into the muscle

282
00:13:59,567 --> 00:14:01,033
And they have
a clean edge.

283
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,467
So you're saying
these were cut out.

284
00:14:03,534 --> 00:14:04,967
With a sharp-edged tool.

285
00:14:05,033 --> 00:14:06,868
He managed to avoid
cutting the sockets

286
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:07,900
Or the eyelids.

287
00:14:07,967 --> 00:14:09,768
This was precise work.

288
00:14:09,834 --> 00:14:12,100
The kind of work
only a doctor could do?

289
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:14,567
All i'm saying is that
with both of these girls,

290
00:14:14,634 --> 00:14:16,434
It was a clean excision.

291
00:14:16,501 --> 00:14:19,900
Ok, so he was crude
with the first victim,

292
00:14:19,967 --> 00:14:21,300
Surgical with the others.

293
00:14:21,367 --> 00:14:22,868
The amount of effort
he's going through

294
00:14:22,933 --> 00:14:26,067
To remove the eyes now,
he wouldn't destroy them.

295
00:14:26,134 --> 00:14:28,567
He's keeping them.

296
00:14:54,967 --> 00:14:57,734
[panting]

297
00:14:59,601 --> 00:15:01,801
[rustling]

298
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,967
Ohh!

299
00:15:42,301 --> 00:15:44,468
He's not afraid
to get caught.

300
00:15:44,533 --> 00:15:46,633
This is far from
the other crime scenes.

301
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,767
What brought him here?

302
00:15:47,834 --> 00:15:49,401
Well, he only killed
one person this time.

303
00:15:49,468 --> 00:15:51,034
It could have been more.

304
00:15:51,101 --> 00:15:52,334
Hey, we found a car
parked nearby.

305
00:15:52,401 --> 00:15:53,867
I.d.'d her from
a dmv photo.

306
00:15:53,934 --> 00:15:57,067
Tracy copper, 32.
husband said she was
an avid jogger.

307
00:15:57,134 --> 00:15:58,967
Single knife wound
to the neck,
eyes are missing.

308
00:15:59,034 --> 00:16:02,134
Cut out as carefully
as the last ones.

309
00:16:05,001 --> 00:16:07,600
Hey, garcia. so we have
the list of local doctors,

310
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:09,534
But we need to back it up
one step.

311
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,234
Where shall i splice,
my pretties?

312
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,867
Give me a list
of all doctors

313
00:16:12,934 --> 00:16:15,534
Who've had infractions
like malpractice suits.

314
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,901
Got it. bouncing your way.

315
00:16:16,967 --> 00:16:18,367
Narrow it down
to eye specialists.

316
00:16:18,433 --> 00:16:19,734
Whoo, that's still
a lot of names.

317
00:16:19,801 --> 00:16:21,201
We'll chip away
when we know more.

318
00:16:21,268 --> 00:16:22,333
Hey, wait.
before you hang up,

319
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,801
How's my morgan doing?

320
00:16:23,867 --> 00:16:24,901
Fine.

321
00:16:24,967 --> 00:16:26,067
I know the man is fine.

322
00:16:26,134 --> 00:16:28,034
How's he holding up
as head honcho?

323
00:16:28,101 --> 00:16:30,867
Well, he's stressed,
but he's on top of it.

324
00:16:30,934 --> 00:16:32,234
Speaking of which,

325
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,901
There is something
you could do for him.

326
00:16:34,967 --> 00:16:36,467
Name it.

327
00:16:37,967 --> 00:16:41,333
He must have hidden
in these trees
lying in wait again.

328
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,101
So he picked his location
and then waited for
a victim of opportunity.

329
00:16:45,168 --> 00:16:48,367
He blitzes her because
he lacks the social
skills to charm.

330
00:16:48,433 --> 00:16:49,867
That feels like
the same pattern

331
00:16:49,934 --> 00:16:51,201
As the girls
in the parking lot.

332
00:16:51,268 --> 00:16:53,168
But he was quiet
in the parking lot.

333
00:16:53,234 --> 00:16:55,367
If he hid in these trees,
there's too much dry brush.

334
00:16:55,433 --> 00:16:56,801
He would have made noise.

335
00:16:56,867 --> 00:16:58,300
No, it's too sloppy for him.

336
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,034
She was a serious jogger.
if she'd heard him,

337
00:17:00,101 --> 00:17:02,367
She might have been able
to outrun him.

338
00:17:02,433 --> 00:17:04,534
Unless he surprised her
some other way.

339
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,268
Guys.

340
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,467
What is that?

341
00:17:07,534 --> 00:17:08,600
A tripwire.

342
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:11,534
We need to look
at her ankles.

343
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:18,234
He used the tripwire
to get her off her feet.

344
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,500
She's stunned
and she doesn't
have time to run away.

345
00:17:20,567 --> 00:17:22,333
He laid a trap for her.

346
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,433
All this, plus the way
he bleeds her at the neck.

347
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,500
It's the behavior
of a game hunter.

348
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:42,400
Hunting's a big part
of this city's culture.

349
00:17:42,467 --> 00:17:44,134
Yeah, hunting animals is.

350
00:17:44,201 --> 00:17:45,967
What triggered him
to start hunting humans?

351
00:17:46,034 --> 00:17:48,634
This guy is taking
people's eyes,

352
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,534
So he's definitely
disturbed.

353
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,867
What bugs me is that
people like this

354
00:17:52,934 --> 00:17:55,600
Usually unravel,
get sloppy.

355
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:58,034
And this guy's
only getting better.

356
00:17:58,867 --> 00:18:00,433
They're back.

357
00:18:02,467 --> 00:18:05,268
Morgan, i'm fielding calls
left and right here.

358
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:06,634
What's happening?

359
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,734
Case made national news.

360
00:18:07,801 --> 00:18:10,201
They're starting to call
him the eye snatcher.

361
00:18:10,268 --> 00:18:11,901
All right, um,

362
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:14,201
You're gonna hold a small,
controlled press conference.

363
00:18:14,268 --> 00:18:16,467
Answer their questions,
but try to squash that name.

364
00:18:16,534 --> 00:18:18,834
I want the people to be aware,
but i do not want to make

365
00:18:18,901 --> 00:18:20,400
A bogeyman out of this guy.
you understand?

366
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:21,567
Yeah. yeah.

367
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:22,934
Is there something else?

368
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:25,134
You're not answering
strauss' calls.

369
00:18:25,201 --> 00:18:28,333
She's just trying
to keep tabs. she can wait.

370
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,433
Morgan. maybe
you should take the time
to field the call.

371
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,634
Hotch, we have to set up
a tip line.

372
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,467
We have to go over
jj's talking points.

373
00:18:35,534 --> 00:18:37,201
We haven't gotten
the profile out yet.

374
00:18:37,268 --> 00:18:39,534
All of that takes priority
over dealing with strauss.

375
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,901
I understand all that.

376
00:18:40,967 --> 00:18:42,867
Let us help you
set up strategy
while you talk to her.

377
00:18:42,934 --> 00:18:44,667
We'll regroup with you
before we proceed.

378
00:18:44,734 --> 00:18:48,201
We have enough battles.
believe me, you don't want
to fight her, too.

379
00:18:48,268 --> 00:18:49,433
Let me get this profile out,

380
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,700
And then i'll go talk
to strauss.

381
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:57,467
He's doing a good job.

382
00:18:57,534 --> 00:18:58,934
He is.

383
00:18:59,001 --> 00:19:00,901
Have you thought about
how this is going to end?

384
00:19:00,967 --> 00:19:02,967
What do you mean?

385
00:19:03,034 --> 00:19:06,600
Morgan as our unit chief
is a temporary thing.

386
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:08,333
It is.

387
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,801
He's a natural leader.
he'll excel.

388
00:19:10,867 --> 00:19:15,168
What happens when
he's asked to step down?

389
00:19:17,934 --> 00:19:19,801
[inaudible conversation]

390
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,901
We believe that our unsub

391
00:19:53,967 --> 00:19:55,734
May have known
his first victim,

392
00:19:55,801 --> 00:19:57,567
Yet the rest were random.

393
00:19:57,634 --> 00:19:59,967
Most enucleators
have a mental disorder

394
00:20:00,067 --> 00:20:02,801
And are frenzied and sloppy
when they attack.

395
00:20:02,867 --> 00:20:04,767
This one has more control.

396
00:20:04,834 --> 00:20:07,433
We are not calling him
by any nickname.

397
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,767
He is simply a murderer
that the fbi is trying
to apprehend.

398
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:13,101
He lays in wait
to kill his victims,

399
00:20:13,168 --> 00:20:15,268
Knows how to cut them
so they bleed out.

400
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:18,268
This indicates he might
have a hunting background.

401
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:21,101
We're urging citizens
to be hypervigilant
at night.

402
00:20:21,168 --> 00:20:24,867
He is killing in different
areas of the city

403
00:20:24,967 --> 00:20:26,333
In public places.

404
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,268
His large kill zone
could be related

405
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,433
To some type
of travel pattern
in his life,

406
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,333
Which indicates a comfort
with these neighborhoods.

407
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,801
Why, all of a sudden,
is he killing people
every day?

408
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:36,433
The escalation
might be caused

409
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,467
By a self-imposed
time line.

410
00:20:38,534 --> 00:20:41,467
He has to murder
so many people,

411
00:20:41,534 --> 00:20:43,834
Take this many eyes,
to accomplish a task.

412
00:20:43,901 --> 00:20:47,134
So he's crazy,
but he's got a mission?

413
00:20:47,201 --> 00:20:48,134
Actually, yes.

414
00:20:48,201 --> 00:20:49,767
He's acting on a delusion

415
00:20:49,834 --> 00:20:51,834
That's fueling
this murder spree.

416
00:20:51,901 --> 00:20:52,867
For example,

417
00:20:52,934 --> 00:20:54,400
A man named herbert mullin.

418
00:20:54,467 --> 00:20:58,067
He had a fear of a catastrophic
earthquake hitting california.

419
00:20:58,134 --> 00:20:59,567
Now, he believed
that by killing people

420
00:20:59,634 --> 00:21:02,300
And offering their blood
as a sacrifice to the earth,

421
00:21:02,367 --> 00:21:04,367
He could prevent
an earthquake.

422
00:21:04,433 --> 00:21:05,901
He was a paranoid
schizophrenic,

423
00:21:05,967 --> 00:21:07,867
And his delusion led him
to kill 13 people.

424
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,667
Uh, what should we look for
when we're on the streets?

425
00:21:09,734 --> 00:21:12,801
We believe he's
a white male, 27 to 35.

426
00:21:12,867 --> 00:21:15,700
We believe he is driving
a van or a pickup truck

427
00:21:15,767 --> 00:21:17,201
With a removable cab.

428
00:21:17,268 --> 00:21:20,400
Something utilitarian
that can get bloody
and wash out easily.

429
00:21:20,467 --> 00:21:22,600
He may also have applied
for hunting licenses.

430
00:21:22,667 --> 00:21:25,600
He has some sort of medical
or surgical training

431
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:28,567
But fell short of making
a career out of it.

432
00:21:28,634 --> 00:21:30,433
Jj: he may have been
in a halfway house

433
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,034
Or have been granted leave
from a treatment facility.

434
00:21:33,101 --> 00:21:35,433
Maybe his family moved him
away and now he's back.

435
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,433
If you know anyone who fits
these types of scenarios,

436
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,934
Please call our tip line.

437
00:21:40,001 --> 00:21:41,801
Our unsub
kills at night,

438
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:44,600
Employs hunting tactics,
and is patient.

439
00:21:44,667 --> 00:21:47,500
He will wait
until he can be alone
with his victims.

440
00:22:08,234 --> 00:22:10,168
[cell phone rings]

441
00:22:10,234 --> 00:22:13,667
[ring]

442
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:16,367
Chief strauss.

443
00:22:16,433 --> 00:22:17,667
You're answering
my calls now?

444
00:22:17,734 --> 00:22:19,067
Listen, i apologize
for this morning,

445
00:22:19,134 --> 00:22:21,101
But i'm sure you can
understand how busy we were.

446
00:22:21,168 --> 00:22:22,767
So what's the strategy
tonight?

447
00:22:22,834 --> 00:22:24,500
I have the team visiting
precincts all over town

448
00:22:24,567 --> 00:22:25,934
Helping locals set up patrol.

449
00:22:26,001 --> 00:22:27,500
And media outlets
are warning citizens

450
00:22:27,567 --> 00:22:28,767
To be hypervigilant.

451
00:22:28,834 --> 00:22:30,433
What about suspects?

452
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,333
Nothing viable yet.

453
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,268
So ultimately,
you're no closer
to catching him tonight.

454
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:35,400
Trust me, i am well aware
that he is probably out there
hunting as we speak.

455
00:22:39,001 --> 00:22:40,934
Now, if i wake up
in the morning
and there are more victims,

456
00:22:41,001 --> 00:22:42,001
That is all on me.

457
00:22:42,067 --> 00:22:45,067
Look,
i'm not criticizing you.

458
00:22:45,134 --> 00:22:47,600
In fact, there are
a lot of people
who have faith in you

459
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:49,967
And want to see you succeed.
do you understand that?

460
00:22:50,034 --> 00:22:51,333
Yes, ma'am.

461
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,667
I'm just checking in
to make sure
your team is intact

462
00:22:53,734 --> 00:22:56,168
And that you have
everything you need
to do your job.

463
00:22:57,867 --> 00:22:59,567
This team is solid,

464
00:22:59,634 --> 00:23:01,801
And we will get
the job done.

465
00:23:01,867 --> 00:23:03,667
We'll touch base
tomorrow.

466
00:23:21,134 --> 00:23:23,534
I'm dreading
going to work.

467
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,268
You always say that.

468
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:26,967
Hey, i'll start looking
for a new job.

469
00:23:27,034 --> 00:23:28,268
We'll grab a paper
in the morning

470
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:30,367
And start circling
whatever looks good to you.

472
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,234
Did you hear something?

473
00:23:43,767 --> 00:23:46,333
That's weird.

474
00:23:47,867 --> 00:23:49,667
I see someone.

476
00:23:52,567 --> 00:23:54,567

00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:57,700
Hello?

478
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,367
What the hell's he doing?
wes?

479
00:24:00,433 --> 00:24:02,534
I'm freaking out.

480
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,801
There's no reception.

481
00:24:09,367 --> 00:24:10,734
Let's go.

482
00:24:10,801 --> 00:24:13,734
No, sandy.
not that way.

483
00:24:18,634 --> 00:24:20,367
Wes, can you see?

484
00:24:20,433 --> 00:24:22,734
Quiet, baby.
he can hear us.

485
00:24:25,767 --> 00:24:28,201
He's behind us.

486
00:24:28,268 --> 00:24:30,433
Get in front of me.

487
00:24:38,934 --> 00:24:40,600
I can't see anything.

488
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:45,767
Get to the car.

Wes.

498
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:37,534
No, please don't.

00:25:56,467 --> 00:25:58,334
Thought i'd beat
everyone here.

500

No.

501
00:26:03,067 --> 00:26:04,567
You here all night?

502
00:26:06,401 --> 00:26:09,300
You know you can't
do that again, right?

503
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:11,134
Rossi,
when you walked in here,

504
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,701
I really thought
you were gonna tell me
that there was another victim.

505
00:26:13,768 --> 00:26:17,567
We're having no luck at all
trying to find this guy
on paper.

506
00:26:17,634 --> 00:26:20,167
That's why we step away,

507
00:26:20,234 --> 00:26:22,467
Get some sleep,
come back fresh.

508
00:26:22,534 --> 00:26:25,567
We're looking for a doctor
who is also a hunter

509
00:26:25,634 --> 00:26:28,601
And a former mental patient
who happens to be cutting
people's eyes out.

510
00:26:28,667 --> 00:26:29,768
Trust the profile.

511
00:26:29,834 --> 00:26:33,734
When we get him,
it'll all make sense.

512
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:34,667
Good morning.

513
00:26:34,734 --> 00:26:35,701
No, it isn't.

514
00:26:35,768 --> 00:26:37,200
Don't tell me.

515
00:26:37,267 --> 00:26:38,900
Brantley: a male
and a female.

516
00:26:38,967 --> 00:26:41,200
Rossi: he's back
to killing 2?

517
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:44,434
There's something different
about this crime scene,
though.

518
00:26:50,768 --> 00:26:52,634
He cut the wires
in the electrical boxes,

519
00:26:52,701 --> 00:26:53,900
Killed all the lights.

520
00:26:53,967 --> 00:26:55,000
So they couldn't see.

521
00:26:55,067 --> 00:26:56,467
He wanted to force them
off the trail

522
00:26:56,534 --> 00:26:57,667
So he could hunt them
in the dark.

523
00:26:57,734 --> 00:26:59,634
If they couldn't see,
he couldn't.

524
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,967
He probably used some kind
of night vision aid,

525
00:27:02,033 --> 00:27:04,768
Like a scope, something
a hunter would use.

526
00:27:05,868 --> 00:27:07,000
Her carotid was severed,

527
00:27:07,067 --> 00:27:09,534
And her eyes are missing,
just like the others.

528
00:27:09,601 --> 00:27:11,234
He didn't take
the boy's eyes.

529
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:14,267
Well, why not?
what's so different?

530
00:27:14,334 --> 00:27:15,768
There's a laceration
on his left eye,

531
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:18,134
The right eye
he didn't even touch.

532
00:27:19,334 --> 00:27:21,067
He's got defensive wounds
on his arms.

533
00:27:21,134 --> 00:27:22,500
He probably tried to fight
back to protect the girl.

534
00:27:23,567 --> 00:27:25,700
During the fight, the unsub
could have cut his eye.

535
00:27:25,767 --> 00:27:27,201
We said he might be
collecting them.

536
00:27:27,268 --> 00:27:30,667
What if he needs a set?
an injury like that
ruins the collection.

537
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:33,001
They're trophies.
oh, my god.

538
00:27:33,067 --> 00:27:33,967
What?

539
00:27:34,284 --> 00:27:35,751
I know this sounds crazy,
but just hear me out.

540
00:27:35,818 --> 00:27:37,884
A taxidermist?

541
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,484
Morgan might be
onto something.

542
00:27:39,551 --> 00:27:42,584
The unsub's collecting
sets of eyes that
need to be flawless.

543
00:27:42,651 --> 00:27:45,150
Because he's preserving them
as a trophy of some kind.

544
00:27:45,217 --> 00:27:47,784
We said he was a hunter.
what do hunters collect
for trophies?

545
00:27:47,851 --> 00:27:50,017
What if we're wrong
about him being a doctor?

546
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:51,184
It makes sense.

547
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:51,317
A taxidermist has
all the skills and supplies

548
00:27:52,918 --> 00:27:55,017
Needed to preserve eyes
and other body parts.

549
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:57,017
Do they know
how to surgically
remove eyes like this?

550
00:27:57,083 --> 00:27:58,484
Yeah, they have anatomy
knowledge.

551
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:00,217
They have to cut through
muscle, tissue, and nerves

552
00:28:00,284 --> 00:28:02,484
In order to remove hide.
it's the exact same thing
for eyeballs.

00:28:02,551 --> 00:28:03,617
[cell phone rings]

554
00:28:03,684 --> 00:28:05,584
Garcia, you're on speaker.

555
00:28:05,651 --> 00:28:06,983
Comrades, i cross-referenced

556
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:09,484
This john o'heron
with okie city animal stuffers.

557
00:28:09,551 --> 00:28:13,250
Turns out he wrote a $250 check
as some sort of deposit

558
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:15,918
For lloyd's wild game shop
6 weeks ago.

559
00:28:15,983 --> 00:28:18,050
Now, this place
is scant miles
from the farm road

560
00:28:18,117 --> 00:28:19,751
Where our first victim
was dumped.

561
00:28:19,818 --> 00:28:21,584
Does lloyd
have a record?

562
00:28:21,651 --> 00:28:23,350
Uh...lloyd bulford

563
00:28:23,417 --> 00:28:26,150
Has one recent record
from the city, and it is...

564
00:28:26,217 --> 00:28:27,484
A death certificate.

565
00:28:27,551 --> 00:28:29,484
He died 4 weeks ago.

566
00:28:29,551 --> 00:28:30,551
Jj: of what?

567
00:28:30,617 --> 00:28:31,884
Emphysema.

568
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,451
Any employees with
criminal records?

569
00:28:33,517 --> 00:28:34,983
He's got no employment
records at all.

570
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:37,717
He has a 28-year-old son
named earl who lives with him

571
00:28:37,784 --> 00:28:40,284
Who has a petty crime record

572
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,651
And 3 counts of animal cruelty.

573
00:28:42,717 --> 00:28:44,350
Garcia, get everything
on the son.

574
00:28:44,417 --> 00:28:45,484
Garcia: okey-dokey.

575
00:28:45,551 --> 00:28:48,317
Morgan, we may
have someone.

from oklahoma city

580
00:29:19,117 --> 00:29:22,751
This is our fifth attempt
to reach mr. earl bulford.

581
00:29:22,818 --> 00:29:25,983
We just want to remind you
that you need to collect
all your belongings

582
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:29,617
And vacate the premises
by sunday.

583
00:29:34,217 --> 00:29:36,317
The eyes aren't right.

584
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,784
Where's your dad?

585
00:29:37,851 --> 00:29:39,484
He's gotta fix
those eyes.

586
00:29:39,551 --> 00:29:40,651
The eyes are good.

587
00:29:40,717 --> 00:29:42,150
You can't do eyes!

588
00:29:42,217 --> 00:29:44,517
Here! i'm taking it
somewhere else.

589
00:29:49,651 --> 00:29:51,384
You can't do eyes.

590
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:59,450
Is there any record
of mental illness?

591
00:29:59,517 --> 00:30:01,583
No, but mom had
a degenerative eye disease

592
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:03,418
Called retinitis pigmentosa,

593
00:30:03,483 --> 00:30:05,050
Which would eventually
lead her to go blind,

594
00:30:05,084 --> 00:30:08,017
And considering his crimes,
that's super weird, right?

595
00:30:08,084 --> 00:30:10,450
So, anyway, she died
in a car accident
when he was 8,

596
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:12,051
And then he gets
expelled from school

597
00:30:12,117 --> 00:30:13,483
For getting in a fight
with a kid

598
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,051
And trying to gouge
the kid's eyes out.

599
00:30:15,117 --> 00:30:17,750
I have no record of him
returning to school,

600
00:30:17,817 --> 00:30:19,750
He has no employment
records,

601
00:30:19,817 --> 00:30:21,917
He's never filed for taxes,
he doesn't have
a credit card in his name.

602
00:30:21,984 --> 00:30:24,251
Besides his driver's license,
there's no record on him at all.

603
00:30:24,318 --> 00:30:26,450
That's probably why
he didn't show up
on any of our lists.

604
00:30:26,517 --> 00:30:28,717
Sounds like he's totally
dependent on his dad,

605
00:30:28,784 --> 00:30:31,650
And when dad dies,
there's no one left
to check up on him.

606
00:30:31,717 --> 00:30:35,084
Ok, dad drove a 1990
dark-brown chevy cargo van.

607
00:30:35,151 --> 00:30:38,117
Hot news--creditors took
the house this week,

608
00:30:38,184 --> 00:30:39,750
And a lien was put
on the business.

609
00:30:39,817 --> 00:30:42,318
Lost his dad, his house,
about to lose
the family business.

610
00:30:42,384 --> 00:30:44,117
Care to choose a stressor?

611
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,784
I'll take the back
with brantley.

612
00:30:56,784 --> 00:30:58,684
There's no van here.

613
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,750
Morgan: copy.

614
00:31:04,051 --> 00:31:05,884
I don't see anything.

615
00:31:15,384 --> 00:31:18,951
Hotch, i see blood.
we're going in.

616
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:43,450
Prentiss: clear.

617
00:31:46,384 --> 00:31:48,717
That's gotta be
john o'heron's blood.

618
00:31:48,784 --> 00:31:50,884
So he comes here
to see his animal,

619
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:53,684
They argue,
and then this happens.

620
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:54,984
Clear.

621
00:32:10,117 --> 00:32:12,084
He's been sleeping here.

622
00:32:12,151 --> 00:32:16,384
Well, if he's not here now,
then he's out hunting again.

623
00:32:18,051 --> 00:32:20,684
This one doesn't have eyes.

624
00:32:22,251 --> 00:32:23,617
Neither does this one.

625
00:32:26,117 --> 00:32:28,384
This one does.

626
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:34,051
This is what's he's doing
with the eyes.

627
00:32:55,057 --> 00:32:57,284
Look at these.
he's been hunting

628
00:32:57,351 --> 00:32:58,317
Since he was a kid.

629
00:32:59,584 --> 00:33:00,883
Never went to school.

630
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:03,551
Probably spent his entire
childhood in here.

631
00:33:03,617 --> 00:33:07,250
Somebody this socially isolated
no doubt has mental issues.

632
00:33:07,317 --> 00:33:09,184
Looks like
he only knew two things--

633
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:10,617
Hunting and taxidermy.

634
00:33:10,684 --> 00:33:13,250
Which was fine as long as
daddy was supervising him.

635
00:33:13,317 --> 00:33:16,584
Now his gatekeeper's gone
and he's loose.

636
00:33:17,718 --> 00:33:19,451
Right over there,
please.

637
00:33:19,517 --> 00:33:20,917
Yes, ma'am.

638
00:33:20,983 --> 00:33:24,184
This is much later
than you guys said
it was gonna be.

639
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:26,250
Let me see it.

640
00:33:30,684 --> 00:33:31,684
Wow.

641
00:33:31,751 --> 00:33:34,517
My daddy's
gonna love it.

642
00:33:37,551 --> 00:33:38,751
What?

643
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:42,317
I need something
from you.

644
00:33:42,384 --> 00:33:45,150
I think this is all of
his customer information.

645
00:33:45,217 --> 00:33:46,983
Morgan, prentiss.

646
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:48,917
Wait. this address,
junction road,

647
00:33:48,983 --> 00:33:51,150
It's close to where
the teenage girls
got killed.

648
00:33:51,217 --> 00:33:52,484
I think he's attacking
all over town

649
00:33:52,551 --> 00:33:53,883
Close to where
his customers live.

650
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,551
I know the customer
on dry creek road,

651
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:57,050
Close to where that jogger
got killed in the park.

652
00:33:57,117 --> 00:33:58,718
And what about where the couple
was murdered last night?

653
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:00,451
Close to this address here.

654
00:34:00,517 --> 00:34:02,517
Ok, so he's delivering
these animals
to his clients' homes

655
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:04,584
And then sticking
around the neighborhood
to find victims.

656
00:34:04,651 --> 00:34:06,017
And there are 2 more
addresses here.

657
00:34:06,084 --> 00:34:07,451
All right, we should
split up and go.

658
00:34:07,517 --> 00:34:08,917
I'll get units
to these locations.

659
00:34:08,983 --> 00:34:10,417
All right,
thank you so much.

660
00:34:10,484 --> 00:34:12,718
The woman
at the bleaker address
hasn't seen him today.

661
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:14,617

at the other residence.

From a taxidermy shop
from this man?

673
00:34:32,517 --> 00:34:33,584
Yes, i did.

I need an apb in my area.

675

How long ago was this?

676
00:34:36,417 --> 00:34:37,484
About an hour ago.

677
00:34:37,551 --> 00:34:39,184
He said he needed
something from me.

678
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,617
The balance i owed.
i paid him and he left.

679
00:34:41,684 --> 00:34:43,084
He creeped the hell
out of me.

what is this about?

they found the van.
it's close.

682
00:34:47,384 --> 00:34:49,084
Excuse us.

683
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:57,651
He must be close by.

00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:28,333
8800 block of descanso,
south side of the street.

698
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,001
Hotch: secure him.

699
00:36:31,068 --> 00:36:32,068
Can you hear me?

700
00:36:32,134 --> 00:36:35,068
Help is on the way.
hold still.

701
00:36:35,134 --> 00:36:37,300
Hold still.

702
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:51,667
Brantley:
you can talk to the fbi
when we come back.

703
00:36:51,934 --> 00:36:53,967
What happened here?

704
00:36:54,034 --> 00:36:55,034
Took him down
by himself.

705
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,467
Morgan: hotch.

706
00:36:57,834 --> 00:37:59,567
Brantley says
you took him down solo.

707
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,400
He wasn't far
behind me.

708
00:37:01,467 --> 00:37:03,067
You know you should have
waited for backup.

709
00:37:03,133 --> 00:37:05,767
Would you have?

710
00:37:13,934 --> 00:37:15,634
What?

711
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:18,434
Nothing.

712
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:22,067
We got him.
we're coming home.

713
00:37:22,133 --> 00:37:24,334
[sighs] you guys rock.

714
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,667
Right back at you.

715
00:37:25,734 --> 00:37:27,667
So how are you doing
on that special ops
mission?

716
00:37:27,734 --> 00:37:29,267
Mission accomplished.

717
00:37:29,334 --> 00:37:31,667
I had no doubt.
bye.

718
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,300
[chuckles]

719
00:37:34,367 --> 00:37:35,567
Keep it.

720
00:37:40,667 --> 00:37:42,834
There he is.

721
00:37:43,934 --> 00:37:45,801
The team's at the hotel
packing.

722
00:37:45,868 --> 00:37:48,133
You think we can leave
in about an hour?

723
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,367
Yeah. yeah, we can try.

724
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:51,801
Hey, that's my stuff. hey!

725
00:37:51,868 --> 00:37:52,934
Where did you get that stuff?

726
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,934
Hey. hey!

727
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,634
Keep your voice down.

728
00:38:00,834 --> 00:38:03,667
That guy was mean.

729
00:38:03,734 --> 00:38:06,133
He deserved it.

730
00:38:09,067 --> 00:38:12,200
You know, you've got...

731
00:38:12,267 --> 00:38:15,767
Real pretty eyes.

732
00:38:19,033 --> 00:38:20,601
Get him out of here--now.

733
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,467
Sorry.

734
00:38:27,534 --> 00:38:30,834
Jj, did they find any more
human eyes at the shop?

735
00:38:30,901 --> 00:38:32,567
Yeah, a few.
they're still looking.

736
00:38:32,634 --> 00:38:34,734
They're hoping
to match the eyes

737
00:38:34,801 --> 00:38:37,234
To the rest
of the victims.

738
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,634
Uh, listen, i may need
more than an hour.

739
00:39:05,167 --> 00:39:06,667
Ms. sukarto.

740
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,801
Agent morgan.

741
00:39:12,868 --> 00:39:14,234
Did you find them?

742
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,267
We did.

743
00:39:15,334 --> 00:39:17,267
They're at the coroner's
office right now.

744
00:39:17,334 --> 00:39:19,100
They need to be processed
for evidence first,

745
00:39:19,167 --> 00:39:22,501
But they can be sent
to the funeral home
of your choice tomorrow.

746
00:39:22,567 --> 00:39:24,767
You have no idea
what this means to us.

747
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,767
I really hope your sister
can rest in peace now.

748
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:32,434
Good night.

749
00:39:41,567 --> 00:39:45,000
Morgan: "dwell in peace
in the home of your own being,

750
00:39:45,067 --> 00:39:48,000
And the messenger of death
will not be able to touch you."

751
00:39:48,067 --> 00:39:49,767
Guru nanak.

752
00:39:56,667 --> 00:39:59,501
You are here late.

753
00:39:59,567 --> 00:40:01,801
Reports.

754
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:05,567
Hotch always stayed later
than the rest of us,

755
00:40:05,634 --> 00:40:08,234
And now i understand why.

756
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:11,734
He doesn't have to write them
anymore. why is he still here?

757
00:40:12,934 --> 00:40:14,667
I don't know.

758
00:40:14,734 --> 00:40:16,767
But i do know
i need to get some rest.

759
00:40:16,834 --> 00:40:18,701
I got another case
starting tomorrow.

760
00:40:18,767 --> 00:40:22,100
Um, i--before you go,
can you help me get
something out of storage?

761
00:40:22,167 --> 00:40:23,934
Yes, baby girl.
anything for you.

762
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,100
Thank you.

763
00:40:25,167 --> 00:40:27,834
Hey, what's that?
i haven't seen it before.

764
00:40:29,367 --> 00:40:32,267
Penelope, there's a lot
of my stuff that you
haven't seen before.

765
00:40:32,334 --> 00:40:35,901
Wow, you are a tease.

766
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,267
Voila.

767
00:40:56,968 --> 00:40:58,934
What are we doing
in hall's office?

768
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,934
Um, it's kind of not
hall's office anymore.

769
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,501
It's your office.

770
00:41:03,567 --> 00:41:04,501
What?

771
00:41:04,567 --> 00:41:05,868
Jj made some calls.

772
00:41:05,934 --> 00:41:07,834
Agent hall's retiring
in a month,

773
00:41:07,901 --> 00:41:10,000
But he's finishing
his caseload at home,

774
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:11,667
So, while you all
were away,

775
00:41:11,734 --> 00:41:13,834
Mama set to work clearing out
the rest of his boxes

776
00:41:13,901 --> 00:41:17,868
And setting up an uber office
fit for our acting unit chief.

777
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:19,567
Garcia, this is for real?

778
00:41:19,634 --> 00:41:22,067
It's kind of blah
for my taste,

779
00:41:22,133 --> 00:41:24,868
But i figured
you needed to keep up
with agency standards.

780
00:41:24,934 --> 00:41:28,300
I did make you your own...

781
00:41:30,267 --> 00:41:32,300
Secret fun zone.

782
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:36,501
[toy squeaking]

783
00:41:36,567 --> 00:41:38,634
Woman,
you have lost your mind.

784
00:41:38,701 --> 00:41:39,968
Mm-hmm.

785
00:41:40,033 --> 00:41:41,367
But you are the best.

786
00:41:41,434 --> 00:41:43,334
I completely agree.

787
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,167
Come here.

788
00:41:47,634 --> 00:41:48,901
I will leave you alone

789
00:41:48,968 --> 00:41:50,934
To mark your territory.

790
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,567
Hey.

791
00:41:54,634 --> 00:41:56,367
Thank you.

792
00:41:56,434 --> 00:41:58,100
Very much.

793
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,501
You are ever so welcome.

794
00:42:40,567 --> 00:42:42,734
[dialing]

795
00:42:46,801 --> 00:42:49,701
Hey. it's me.

796
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:52,200
Yeah, i'm back.

797
00:42:52,267 --> 00:42:54,133
Listen, uh...

798
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:57,601
Does that offer
for a drink still stand?
