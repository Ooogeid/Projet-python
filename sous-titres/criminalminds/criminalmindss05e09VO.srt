If you stop hunting me,

4
00:00:04,067 --> 00:00:05,134
I'll stop hunting them.

5
00:00:05,201 --> 00:00:06,600
I don't make deals.
i'm the guy

6
00:00:06,667 --> 00:00:08,001
Who hunts guys like you.

7
00:00:08,067 --> 00:00:09,101
You'll regret this.

8
00:00:09,167 --> 00:00:10,134
You should have
made a deal.

00:00:11,234 --> 00:00:12,800
Are you sure
that we're in danger?

11

Yes.

12
00:00:14,301 --> 00:00:15,867
Tell them i'll protect them
like they're my own.

13
00:00:15,934 --> 00:00:17,067
I'm not leaving
the team,

14
00:00:17,134 --> 00:00:18,434
I'm just no longer
in charge.

00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,633
Me?
you are.

George foyet
was the ninth victim

17
00:00:21,201 --> 00:00:23,001
And the only one
who survived
the reaper.

18
00:00:23,067 --> 00:00:24,334
He inflicted those
wounds on himself.

19
00:00:24,401 --> 00:00:25,500
George foyet
is the reaper.

20
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:28,101
One of the inmates
has received 2 envelopes

21
00:00:28,167 --> 00:00:29,900
I'll get this to the lab.
in the last 2 days.

22
00:00:29,967 --> 00:00:31,434
He's torturing him.

23
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,667
It's great to see you
squirm, agent hotchner.

Get out of here.

00:02:21,834 --> 00:02:24,334
Go see if they need

38
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,700
And how long have you
been a member of the bau?

00:03:30,767 --> 00:03:31,700
6 years.

40
00:03:31,767 --> 00:03:32,867
Could you speak up, please?

00:03:32,934 --> 00:03:34,634
[clears throat]
sorry. 6 years.

42
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,234
And have you worked under
agent hotchner the entire time?

43
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,467
No, ma'am. i currently

44
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:41,067
Report to acting unit chief
derek morgan.

45
00:03:41,134 --> 00:03:43,800
Who took over the unit
because agent hotchner's

46
00:03:43,867 --> 00:03:45,934
Ability to lead the team
had become compromised.

47
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:48,500
I--i don't believe
that's the reason.

48
00:03:48,567 --> 00:03:49,800
You have
a different opinion?

49
00:03:49,867 --> 00:03:52,334
It's not just an opinion.

50
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,334
You have a different
understanding?

51
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,368
Ssa hotchner voluntarily
stepped down

52
00:03:58,433 --> 00:04:00,800
So we could continue
to do our jobs unhindered.

53
00:04:02,234 --> 00:04:05,667
How would you describe agent
hotchner's recent behavior?

54
00:04:05,734 --> 00:04:06,901
Driven.

55
00:04:06,967 --> 00:04:10,400
Driven. agent jareau,
your entire team is on the line

56
00:04:10,467 --> 00:04:13,034
If i cannot reconcile
an adequate account

57
00:04:13,101 --> 00:04:16,268
Of agent hotchner's
investigation into george foyet.

58
00:04:16,334 --> 00:04:18,734
We were all investigating
the reaper.

59
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,934
Ssa hotchner
was not the only one,

60
00:04:21,001 --> 00:04:23,600
Especially after he sent us
that calling card.

61
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:25,934
The newspaper articles
he mailed to karl arnold.

62
00:04:26,001 --> 00:04:27,700
2 letters from
2 different locations.

63
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,201
They ramped us all
back up again.

64
00:04:29,268 --> 00:04:31,901
I should just start
at the beginning.

65
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:35,001
Foyet had done a lot
of injury to himself

66
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:37,268
In the original
string of killings,

67
00:04:37,334 --> 00:04:38,934
In an effort to paint
himself as a victim

68
00:04:39,001 --> 00:04:40,600
And throw us off
the investigation.

69
00:04:40,667 --> 00:04:42,533
As a result,
he became dependent upon

70
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,368
A large number of extremely
strong medications.

71
00:04:45,433 --> 00:04:47,301
We'd been searching
the country for patients

72
00:04:47,368 --> 00:04:49,567
With that exact
prescription combination,

73
00:04:49,634 --> 00:04:52,134
But we hadn't had any luck.

74
00:04:52,201 --> 00:04:54,433
The envelopes foyet mailed
to arnold are due back
from the lab.

75
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,567
They're flagged urgent.

76
00:04:55,634 --> 00:04:57,934
Gina's here with them now.

77
00:04:58,001 --> 00:04:59,500
They're processed. clean.
no prints, no dna.

78
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:00,567
She says they're clean.

79
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:01,734
Yeah, of course they are.

80
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,167
Anderson, listen to me.

81
00:05:03,234 --> 00:05:05,167
I don't care
if you have to drive

82
00:05:05,234 --> 00:05:06,734
To the postmaster general's
house.

83
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,234
I want to know where
those postmarks were applied

84
00:05:08,301 --> 00:05:09,500
Before the team gets in.

85
00:05:09,567 --> 00:05:11,700
Yes, ma'am. copy that.

86
00:05:18,334 --> 00:05:19,667
Found it.

87
00:05:20,967 --> 00:05:23,101
He's still not taking
his bottle.

88
00:05:23,167 --> 00:05:24,600
Here. let me try.

89
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:26,400
Hey...

90
00:05:26,467 --> 00:05:28,767
Can you take
your bottle, please?

91
00:05:28,834 --> 00:05:30,268
Can you take--oh...

92
00:05:30,334 --> 00:05:32,667
Thank you so much.

93
00:05:32,734 --> 00:05:36,400
Oh, yeah. you are definitely
mama's little boy, huh?

94
00:05:36,467 --> 00:05:37,834
Just like his ddy.

95
00:05:39,467 --> 00:05:40,600
Pharmacist: next.

96
00:05:40,667 --> 00:05:42,934
Hey, if you have to go,
go ahead.

97
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:44,800
I can take care of this.

98
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:54,234
I don't know what i would do
if i were in hotch's shoes.

99
00:05:55,867 --> 00:05:58,433
If i ever had to say good-bye
to you and henry because--

100
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,667
We'rnot going anywhere.

101
00:06:01,634 --> 00:06:02,634
We're not.

102
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,334
You're tracking
the prescriptions,

103
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,400
You're tracking
the postmarks.

104
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,567
Aside from another body
landing on your doorstep,

105
00:06:09,634 --> 00:06:12,400
You're doing all you can.

106
00:06:12,467 --> 00:06:13,634
I hope so,

107
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,334
For hotch's sake.

108
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,600
Next.

109
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:19,067
That's us.

110
00:06:20,301 --> 00:06:21,500
Here we are.

111
00:06:21,567 --> 00:06:24,034
Oh, actually, there should be
2 prescriptions.

112
00:06:24,101 --> 00:06:25,167
We filled the antibiotics,

113
00:06:25,234 --> 00:06:27,034
But we're out of
the antihistamine.

114
00:06:27,101 --> 00:06:29,368
You know, crushing
half a claritin

115
00:06:29,433 --> 00:06:30,767
Would do the job
just the same.

116
00:06:30,834 --> 00:06:32,700
Save you a couple bucks,
too.

117
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:33,734
Wait--excuse me,

118
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,201
Are there a lot

119
00:06:35,268 --> 00:06:36,934
Of over-the-counter
medications

120
00:06:37,001 --> 00:06:38,268
That can be substituted
for prescriptions?

121
00:06:38,334 --> 00:06:39,500
Too many to count.

122
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:42,500
Most of the time,
it's just a matter of dosage.

123
00:06:42,567 --> 00:06:45,500
Foyet's meds--we have been
tracking the entire
combination.

124
00:06:45,567 --> 00:06:47,433
What if he's been using
over-the-counter meds

125
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,201
For some of it
to mask his purchases?

126
00:06:49,268 --> 00:06:50,667
Ok, narrow the search.
focus on the meds

127
00:06:50,734 --> 00:06:52,067
He can't substitute.
good work.

128
00:06:52,134 --> 00:06:53,201
[knock on door]
just got a call

129
00:06:53,268 --> 00:06:55,268
From the postmaster general
inspector's office.

130
00:06:55,334 --> 00:06:56,234
Already?

131
00:06:56,301 --> 00:06:58,034
I'm not just a pretty face.

132
00:06:58,101 --> 00:07:00,368
Is garcia in yet?

133
00:07:01,467 --> 00:07:03,400
Are you sure?

134
00:07:03,467 --> 00:07:06,268
Bacon doughnut.
you'll never be the same.

135
00:07:06,334 --> 00:07:08,667
I can totally think of
more palatable ways

136
00:07:08,734 --> 00:07:11,567
To up my adventure quotient,
thank you.

137
00:07:11,634 --> 00:07:14,067
O...m...g.

138
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:16,234
It gets better
every time.

139
00:07:16,301 --> 00:07:18,034
Kevin, you need to leave
right now.

140
00:07:18,101 --> 00:07:19,500
Would you like some water?

141
00:07:19,567 --> 00:07:21,734
No, thank you, ma'am.

142
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,467
Are you all right?

143
00:07:23,533 --> 00:07:26,734
I--i'm just not, uh,

144
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,767
Comfortable
with any of this.

145
00:07:29,667 --> 00:07:32,533
It's not ok.

146
00:07:33,834 --> 00:07:37,234
What do you mean?

147
00:07:37,301 --> 00:07:39,101
In my opinion,

148
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:43,034
Everyone is asking
the wrong questions.

149
00:07:43,101 --> 00:07:45,600
Doesn't anybody care

150
00:07:45,667 --> 00:07:47,268
About what the reaper
did to them,

151
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:48,734
How many people he hurt?

152
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,034
All anyone seems
to care about is...

153
00:07:53,934 --> 00:07:55,800
This just isn't right.

154
00:07:59,433 --> 00:08:03,134
Do you think that
agent hotchner was acting...

155
00:08:03,201 --> 00:08:06,667
Agitated or unreasonable?

156
00:08:06,734 --> 00:08:07,901
He...

157
00:08:07,967 --> 00:08:09,800
No, no, he--

158
00:08:09,867 --> 00:08:11,901
He was freaked out
about his family.

159
00:08:11,967 --> 00:08:13,334
Which, considering
what happened,

160
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,001
I'd say was perfectly
reasonable.

161
00:08:16,067 --> 00:08:18,234
The foyet letters came from
fredericksburg, virginia,

162
00:08:18,301 --> 00:08:19,600
And westminster, maryland.

163
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:21,101
We can match
the prescription drugs

164
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,067
Foyet can't substitute
with a geographic profile

165
00:08:23,134 --> 00:08:24,034
Of the 2 cities.

166
00:08:24,101 --> 00:08:25,301
Can't substitute?

167
00:08:25,368 --> 00:08:26,800
We need you to track
the drugs that can't be emulated

168
00:08:26,867 --> 00:08:28,467
With over-the-counter drugs
and can only be dispensed

169
00:08:28,533 --> 00:08:29,967
By a pharmacist, and you
need to do it quickly.

170
00:08:30,034 --> 00:08:31,934
Foyet doesn't stay
in one place very long.

171
00:08:32,001 --> 00:08:33,467
Then kevin needs to stay.

172
00:08:33,533 --> 00:08:35,700
What?
sir, kevin is
an amazing analyst.

173
00:08:35,767 --> 00:08:37,301
I can work almost
twice as fast

174
00:08:37,368 --> 00:08:38,500
Fine.
with him running
part of my system.

175
00:08:38,567 --> 00:08:40,368
Garcia, now long?
these are your screens.

176
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:42,234
I'll know once i get
into it.

177
00:08:42,301 --> 00:08:43,433
We're gonna work
the geographic profile.

178
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,834
Call me when you have
something. and hurry.

179
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:48,368
Uh, ok...

180
00:08:48,433 --> 00:08:50,201
I am gonna start
with the ultram--

181
00:08:50,268 --> 00:08:52,201
No--you're gonna start
with the ultram and naproxen.

182
00:08:52,268 --> 00:08:53,467
I'll work on the rest.

183
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,667
There's approximately
115 miles

184
00:08:55,734 --> 00:08:57,167
Between fredericksburg
and westminster.

185
00:08:57,234 --> 00:08:58,800
Why mail a letter from 2 cities?

186
00:08:58,867 --> 00:09:00,667
Maybe it's purely
a forensic countermeasure.

187
00:09:00,734 --> 00:09:02,600
He knows that mailing
letters close to home
would lead us right to him,

188
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,634
So he drives far away
to mail the letters
to throw us off his scent.

189
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,934
The unabomber did that.
so did the 2001 anthrax suspect.

190
00:09:08,001 --> 00:09:10,734
He could have gone anywhere,
but he's trolling the d.c. area.

191
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,234
It makes sense
to stay close to hotch.

192
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,901
He stuck around boston
to watch shaunessy deteriorate.

193
00:09:17,234 --> 00:09:18,334
Not that you're--

194
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,767
It's all right.
i know he's been watching me.

195
00:09:19,834 --> 00:09:21,334
It's part of the reason
i stepped down,

196
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,101
So he'd think
i was falling apart.

197
00:09:26,634 --> 00:09:29,067
Naproxen is available
in generic brands
over the counter.

198
00:09:29,134 --> 00:09:32,067
Naproxen's properties
can be simulated by aleve.

199
00:09:32,134 --> 00:09:33,567
Ultram can be substituted.

200
00:09:33,634 --> 00:09:34,767
Ok, oxycontin.

201
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:36,400
Jeez, he's on that, too?

202
00:09:36,467 --> 00:09:38,134
Yeah, and it's highladdictive
and therefore regulated,

203
00:09:38,201 --> 00:09:39,368
So there's no substitute for it.

204
00:09:39,433 --> 00:09:40,734
I know the dea
has a problem with it.

205
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,567
You can buy it
on the streets if
you know where to go.

206
00:09:42,634 --> 00:09:43,867
Good point. ok, we're gonna
leave that off the list for now

207
00:09:43,934 --> 00:09:46,234
'cause there's another way
to get it. next up...

208
00:09:46,301 --> 00:09:47,134
Tapazole.

209
00:09:47,201 --> 00:09:48,234
What's that?

210
00:09:48,301 --> 00:09:50,067
Uh, it treats hyperthyroidism.

211
00:09:50,134 --> 00:09:51,867
Hey, what's wrong
with this guy, anyway?

212
00:09:51,934 --> 00:09:53,567
He stabbed himself--a lot.

213
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:54,834
Stabbed himself?

214
00:09:54,901 --> 00:09:57,067
Yeah. so his body would have
permanent internal damage--

215
00:09:57,134 --> 00:09:58,800
Work, honey--and he'd need

216
00:09:58,867 --> 00:10:01,368
This prescription
to regulate his heart rate,

217
00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:03,734
Keep down the palpitations
and the tremors.

218
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,134
And there is no substitute
for tapazole.

219
00:10:06,201 --> 00:10:08,201
So if this is our missing
link, how do we find him?

220
00:10:08,268 --> 00:10:09,767
Print out every person
who's on this prescription

221
00:10:09,834 --> 00:10:11,567
Within a 60-mile of both cities.
the team will do the rest.

222
00:10:11,634 --> 00:10:12,800
I'm gonna use your laptop.

223
00:10:12,867 --> 00:10:14,967
Ok, so what are we gonna do
about the 2 cities?

224
00:10:15,034 --> 00:10:18,467
Usually we need 3 different
points to get an accurate
geographic profile.

225
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:20,167
That's all we got right now.

226
00:10:20,234 --> 00:10:21,667
Prentiss:
gaithersburg, rockville,

227
00:10:21,734 --> 00:10:23,234
D.c., alexandria,

228
00:10:23,301 --> 00:10:25,667
Bowie, annapolis.

229
00:10:25,734 --> 00:10:27,467
Where the hell are you,
foyet?

230
00:10:27,533 --> 00:10:29,634
Ok, me and the boy
found a thyroid medication

231
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,368
That has no substitute
over the counter.

232
00:10:31,433 --> 00:10:33,334
You've gotta get it
from a pharmacist.

233
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,467
But a lot of people
are on it.

234
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:35,967
Find the midpoint
between the 2 cities

235
00:10:36,034 --> 00:10:37,967
And isolate names
in a 25-mile radius.

236
00:10:38,034 --> 00:10:39,034
153 names.

237
00:10:39,101 --> 00:10:41,700
Well, he's not gonna use
his own name.

238
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:43,201
What kind of aliases
should we be looking for?

239
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:44,734
He could have easily
stolen someone's identity.

240
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,467
No, he's a narcissist
in love with
his own mythology.

241
00:10:46,533 --> 00:10:48,433
He'd use a name
connected with the case.

242
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,867
A victim, maybe,
a cop.

243
00:10:49,934 --> 00:10:51,834
Ok. let's check
the foyet files

244
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,934
For a list of names. and...

245
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:55,634
Nothing.

246
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,901
Wait a minute, guys.
foyet likes things
to have meaning to him.

247
00:10:57,967 --> 00:10:59,600
The eye of providence,

248
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:03,268
The addresses in blood
he wrote on the bus
that led us back to him.

249
00:11:03,334 --> 00:11:04,734
Maybe he's doing the same
thing with the alias.

250
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,301
Like an anagram
or something.

251
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:17,101
You see something, reid?

252
00:11:17,167 --> 00:11:18,268
Not yet.

253
00:11:18,334 --> 00:11:20,167
Reid, he named himself
the reaper.

254
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,867
Peter rhea.

255
00:11:31,001 --> 00:11:33,167
There's a peter rhea
in arlington.

256
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,867
Rossi: we found him.

257
00:11:43,067 --> 00:11:44,001
Once the team located

258
00:11:44,067 --> 00:11:45,334
George foyet's
potential apartment,

259
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,234
Why didn't the bau
enter immediately?

260
00:11:49,867 --> 00:11:51,800
Agent rossi?

261
00:11:51,867 --> 00:11:53,134
Hmm?

262
00:11:53,201 --> 00:11:55,167
I asked you a question.

263
00:11:58,234 --> 00:12:00,534
Gold is still going up.

264
00:12:00,601 --> 00:12:04,401
But knowing when to get out,
that's the trick.

265
00:12:04,467 --> 00:12:06,467
[turns off recorder]

266
00:12:07,034 --> 00:12:08,734
What are you doing?

267
00:12:08,801 --> 00:12:11,434
What's the point
of all this, erin?

268
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,600
Why?

269
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:15,001
So this never happens again.

270
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,434
There is nothing
a bureaucrat can do

271
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,001
To make sure that
something like this
never happens again.

272
00:12:21,068 --> 00:12:24,534
So we just wait
for the next bloodbath?

273
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,634
[turns on recorder]

274
00:12:33,701 --> 00:12:37,500
Why did you wait so long
before going to foyet's
apartment?

275
00:12:38,934 --> 00:12:41,300
We had to be sure
he was there.

276
00:12:41,367 --> 00:12:43,400
If we went in
and he wasn't,

277
00:12:43,467 --> 00:12:45,934
He would know
we found him.

278
00:12:46,001 --> 00:12:47,667
Of course,
the longer we waited,

279
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:49,400
The more time he had to...

280
00:12:51,134 --> 00:12:53,233
It was an impossible
decision.

281
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,567
So who made it?

282
00:12:54,634 --> 00:12:56,801
Agent hotchner?

283
00:13:02,134 --> 00:13:04,901
How much longer
do we wait?

284
00:13:06,233 --> 00:13:09,367
I need to leave that call
to someone else.

285
00:13:17,367 --> 00:13:18,867
Swat's getting antsy.

286
00:13:18,934 --> 00:13:21,034
I'll tell them
when it's time to go.

287
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:24,267
Right now we sit tight.
let them know.

288
00:13:28,101 --> 00:13:30,701
These guys are trained
to move, not just sit around.

289
00:13:30,767 --> 00:13:32,200
I can't really
say that i blame them.

290
00:13:32,267 --> 00:13:33,867
He may not even
be there anymore.

291
00:13:33,934 --> 00:13:36,267
I know. the longer
we sit here,
the further away he gets.

292
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:39,034
You make the best call
you can, kid.

293
00:13:39,101 --> 00:13:41,934
All right, this is what
we're gonna do.

294
00:13:48,634 --> 00:13:50,734
Super.

295
00:13:52,801 --> 00:13:54,734
Super.

296
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:56,834
There's a leak
in the apartment above you.

297
00:13:56,901 --> 00:13:58,734
I need to check your ceiling.

298
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,001
Are you getting the signal?

299
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:22,068
Copy.

300
00:14:22,134 --> 00:14:23,867
No warm bodies.

301
00:14:23,934 --> 00:14:27,934
Looks like kitchen table,
chair.

302
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:30,068
Is that a laptop
on the table?

303
00:14:30,134 --> 00:14:31,967
It could be useful.

304
00:14:32,034 --> 00:14:33,967
Rossi: is that food?
get closer to that.

305
00:14:34,034 --> 00:14:37,200
Wait, go back.
what's that on the floor?

306
00:14:38,567 --> 00:14:40,567
Yeah.
it's his mail.

307
00:14:48,934 --> 00:14:52,333
Go, go, go, go!

308
00:14:56,567 --> 00:14:58,168
Hurry up!
let's go!

309
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:24,734
What happened?

310
00:15:24,801 --> 00:15:27,267
He's not coming back here.
he left an untouched meal.

311
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:28,934
You drop your mail like this
when you're startled,

312
00:15:29,001 --> 00:15:30,867
When you need to get out
of dodge quick.

313
00:15:30,934 --> 00:15:32,801
Something tipped him off.
he knew we were coming here.

314
00:15:32,867 --> 00:15:34,801
Suitcases are open,
some clothes are missing.

315
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,300
There's a safe with
a stash of guns in it.

316
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:38,034
He didn't even bother
to lock them up again.

317
00:15:38,101 --> 00:15:39,667
If he's in a hurry,
he'll make a mistake.

318
00:15:39,734 --> 00:15:41,034
Yeah, but when
foyet gets cornered,

319
00:15:41,101 --> 00:15:42,068
He starts killing.

320
00:15:42,134 --> 00:15:44,400
We're not gonna
let that happen.

321
00:15:45,701 --> 00:15:48,233
We need to get garcia
on this.

322
00:15:50,001 --> 00:15:52,367
He is creepy good.

323
00:15:52,434 --> 00:15:54,434
How good?

324
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,300
He wiped his hard drive.
might have been
in a hurry to leave,

325
00:15:56,367 --> 00:15:57,801
But whatever was on there,
he did not want us to see it.

326
00:15:57,867 --> 00:16:00,168
Garcia, tell me that
you're hacked in and
that you can rebuild it.

327
00:16:00,233 --> 00:16:01,367
Watch me work, darling.

328
00:16:01,434 --> 00:16:02,967
Hello.
[beeping]

329
00:16:03,034 --> 00:16:04,967
What have you got?

330
00:16:05,034 --> 00:16:07,001
He had an internet alarm
on the name peter rhea.

331
00:16:07,068 --> 00:16:09,001
It alerted him as soon as
we ran a check on it.

332
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:11,500
What else did he wipe?

333
00:16:11,567 --> 00:16:13,434
Garcia, wait a minute.
freeze it right there.

334
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,667
Oh, my god,
isn't that--

335
00:16:15,734 --> 00:16:17,434
That's the u.s. marshal
assigned to my family.

336
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,267
Foyet's been watching him
this whole time?

337
00:16:21,567 --> 00:16:24,101
Voicemail:
kassmeyer. leave a message.

338
00:16:24,168 --> 00:16:25,667
Sam, it's aaron.
we found foyet's location,

339
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,001
But he has surveillance
photos of you.

340
00:16:27,068 --> 00:16:29,801
Call me for a meet location
or we're on our way to you.

341
00:16:29,867 --> 00:16:31,600
We're gonna need to deploy
another swat unit.

342
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:33,500
That's gonna take
another half hour.

343
00:16:34,901 --> 00:16:36,233
Hotch?

344
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,801
Go. go.

345
00:16:37,867 --> 00:16:40,967
You left for marshal kassmeyer's
house immediately?

346
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:42,101
Yes, ma'am.

347
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,400
Wouldn't this be a job
for a tactical team?

348
00:16:44,467 --> 00:16:47,034
We felt that it would
take too much time

349
00:16:47,101 --> 00:16:48,934
To get authorization
for another operation.

350
00:16:49,001 --> 00:16:49,934
We?

351
00:16:50,001 --> 00:16:51,134
All of us.

352
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,867
Don't you mean agent hotchner
wanted that?

353
00:16:52,934 --> 00:16:54,534
No, i mean all of us
wanted that.

354
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,801
I know what
you're thinking,

355
00:16:55,867 --> 00:16:58,767
And i agree it would be
easy for us to blame him.

356
00:16:58,834 --> 00:16:59,867
Easy?

357
00:16:59,934 --> 00:17:01,634
Yeah. why not just
say it's his fault

358
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:03,600
And then we can all
just forget about it.

359
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:05,967
But, uh, the problem is,

360
00:17:06,034 --> 00:17:07,367
I have an eidetic memory,

361
00:17:07,434 --> 00:17:10,367
And that's not
what happened.

362
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:32,600
Sam.

363
00:17:32,667 --> 00:17:34,333
This is agent rossi, fbi.
we need an ambulance.

364
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,068
We have a federal
officer down.

365
00:17:36,134 --> 00:17:40,068
I wouldn't...i wouldn't...

366
00:17:40,134 --> 00:17:41,701
We're getting an ambulance.

367
00:17:41,767 --> 00:17:43,534
I tried.
hang on.

368
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,600
Just hang on.

369
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:46,101
I'm sorry.

370
00:17:46,168 --> 00:17:48,034
What are you sorry for?

371
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:50,134
I...i tried.

372
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,101
Are jack and haley safe?

373
00:17:52,168 --> 00:17:54,200
[breathing hard]

374
00:17:54,267 --> 00:17:56,734
Sam, tell me
what happened.

375
00:17:56,801 --> 00:17:58,434
I don't know how
he got in.

376
00:18:07,101 --> 00:18:08,867
Aah!

377
00:18:08,934 --> 00:18:10,734
Where are they?

378
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,168
Aah!

379
00:18:14,233 --> 00:18:15,934
Where are they?

380
00:18:16,001 --> 00:18:18,068
I don't know
what you're talking about.

381
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:21,500
Aah!

382
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,267
Aah!

383
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,034
I'm gonna find out...

384
00:18:25,101 --> 00:18:28,534
One way or another.
ohh!

385
00:18:31,967 --> 00:18:34,467
Sam, i need to understand.

386
00:18:34,534 --> 00:18:36,068
Does he know where
jack and haley are?

387
00:18:36,134 --> 00:18:38,634
I didn't...

388
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,200
This little piggy...

389
00:18:42,267 --> 00:18:43,701
Aah!

390
00:18:43,767 --> 00:18:47,367
Look at that. he's not
going anywhere, is he?

391
00:18:49,801 --> 00:18:53,068
What about her phone number?
what's her safe phone number?

392
00:18:53,134 --> 00:18:56,333
I didn't...it won't matter.

393
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,967
Kill me. i'm not telling you
anything.

394
00:18:59,034 --> 00:19:01,901
You're not gonna get off
that easy.

395
00:19:01,967 --> 00:19:03,600
I need you alive
so you can tell
agent hotchner

396
00:19:03,667 --> 00:19:06,534
That it's his fault
that his family's dead.

397
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,634
Aah!

398
00:19:08,701 --> 00:19:12,801
I--i tried, hotch.

399
00:19:12,867 --> 00:19:15,233
[breathing hard]

400
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,734
Gunshot wounds to each leg,
one foot,

401
00:19:16,801 --> 00:19:18,701
He's missing several fingers,
and appears to be badly beaten.

402
00:19:18,767 --> 00:19:21,034
Clear out of the way.

403
00:19:21,101 --> 00:19:23,467
Get me a c-collar,
prep me a saline drip

404
00:19:23,534 --> 00:19:24,767
While i grab a round of vitals.

405
00:19:24,834 --> 00:19:26,500
Sam, are you allergic
to any medication?

406
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:27,534
Hotch.

407
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,967
Sam, i'm right here.

408
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:31,534
I tried.

409
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,300
Make sure they have
a trauma surgeon standing by.

410
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,600
Strauss: do you believe
it was marshal kassmeyer's fault

411
00:19:40,667 --> 00:19:42,667
That agent hotchner's family
was compromised?

412
00:19:42,734 --> 00:19:43,667
Absolutely not.

413
00:19:43,734 --> 00:19:45,200
You answered that
very quickly.

414
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,333
When you're being tortured,
there's no end in sight,

415
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,734
Except giving them
what they want.

416
00:19:48,801 --> 00:19:50,101
And kassmeyer didn't do that?

417
00:19:50,168 --> 00:19:51,701
He withstood everything
that foyet had.

418
00:19:51,767 --> 00:19:54,300
Then tell me
exactly what happened.

419
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,667
Is he conscious?

420
00:19:56,734 --> 00:19:57,600
In and out.

421
00:19:57,667 --> 00:19:58,834
Sam, it's aaron.

422
00:19:58,901 --> 00:20:00,901
Can you hear me?

423
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:03,367
[siren]

424
00:20:04,267 --> 00:20:05,434
I'm right here, sam.
aaron.

425
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,834
His pressure's dropping.

426
00:20:06,901 --> 00:20:08,233
10cc morphine
going in.

427
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,101
Do not sedate me.
i need to talk.

428
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:13,801
Sam, does foyet know
where jack and haley are?

429
00:20:13,867 --> 00:20:17,068
I wouldn't tell him.
it doesn't matter.

430
00:20:19,901 --> 00:20:21,233
Let me guess.

431
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,467
The marshals service

432
00:20:22,534 --> 00:20:26,101
Doesn't have anything
listed by name.

433
00:20:26,168 --> 00:20:27,500
Case numbers only.

434
00:20:27,567 --> 00:20:29,267
The thing is,

435
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,734
This relocation is
a bit of a special favor,

436
00:20:31,801 --> 00:20:34,300
Which tells me that you might
bring your work home with you.

437
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:38,434
Who knows? maybe even
on emergency speed dial.

438
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,367
[clicks tongue]

439
00:20:41,567 --> 00:20:43,667
Hello, haley?

440
00:20:43,734 --> 00:20:46,967
I'm sorry. wrong number.

441
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,267
Hello, is haley there?

442
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,901
Uh, uh, no, ma'am.
i'm sorry.

443
00:20:50,967 --> 00:20:52,434
It must have been
a wrong number.

444
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,134
Hello, is haley there?

445
00:20:55,233 --> 00:20:57,801
Hello, haley?

446
00:20:57,867 --> 00:20:59,600
Hello, is haley there?

447
00:20:59,667 --> 00:21:01,267
Sam?

448
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:02,500
Haley.

449
00:21:02,567 --> 00:21:04,367
Ohh--hal--

450
00:21:04,434 --> 00:21:05,333
Uhh!

451
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,567
Sorry for using
your real name, ma'am.

452
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:09,967
My name is victor collins.
i'm with the marshals service.

453
00:21:10,034 --> 00:21:11,233
Ma'am, we have a problem.

454
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,867
Marshal kassmeyer
has been killed,

455
00:21:13,934 --> 00:21:16,567
And we're afraid your location
may have been compromised.

456
00:21:16,634 --> 00:21:18,434
What?

457
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,267
Ma'am, i need you
to focus right now.
this is about saving your son.

458
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,634
We're trying to save jack.
do you understand me?

459
00:21:22,701 --> 00:21:23,467
Yes.

460
00:21:23,534 --> 00:21:25,467
I'm afraid there's more, ma'am.

461
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,534
I'm not quite sure
how to tell you this, but...

462
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,034
Your ex-husband
has been killed as well.

463
00:21:32,101 --> 00:21:33,300
Oh, god.

464
00:21:33,367 --> 00:21:35,001
We're gonna bring
you and your son in safe,

465
00:21:35,068 --> 00:21:36,767
But i'm gonna need
your help for this, ok?

466
00:21:36,834 --> 00:21:38,867
When we're through speaking,
i want you to hang up the phone.

467
00:21:38,934 --> 00:21:41,233
Do not attempt to call
anybody else.

468
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,200
Do you understand me?
it could be intercepted.

469
00:21:43,267 --> 00:21:44,267
Yes.

470
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:45,600
The next thing i need you to do

471
00:21:45,667 --> 00:21:47,367
Is buy a disposable cell phone.

472
00:21:47,434 --> 00:21:50,267
Get back in your car,
call me at this number.

473
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,901
Once i know your mobile,
i'll give you another number

474
00:21:52,967 --> 00:21:55,333
Along with some instructions
on how to proceed.

475
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,434
Ok.

476
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,867
Now, ma'am,
i do not want you to worry.

477
00:21:58,934 --> 00:22:02,200
We're gonna bring you and jack
in here safely.

478
00:22:02,267 --> 00:22:04,233
Are you...

479
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,634
Are you sure aaron is...

480
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,967
Are you sure?

481
00:22:09,034 --> 00:22:11,267
Yes, ma'am.

482
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:13,267
I'm terribly sorry.

483
00:22:18,734 --> 00:22:19,867
[tosses cell phone on table]

484
00:22:19,934 --> 00:22:21,567
See you later.

485
00:22:26,068 --> 00:22:28,001
Ok.

486
00:22:28,068 --> 00:22:29,467
[breathing hard]

487
00:22:29,534 --> 00:22:32,267
She's going to him.

488
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:36,867
I'm so sorry, hotch.

489
00:22:36,934 --> 00:22:39,567
[beeping]

490
00:22:39,634 --> 00:22:41,434
[flatline tone]

491
00:23:02,834 --> 00:23:05,701
They're ready for you.

492
00:23:08,434 --> 00:23:10,200
Agent prentiss.

493
00:23:10,267 --> 00:23:12,300
Ma'am.

494
00:23:12,367 --> 00:23:13,968
We understand
that agent hotchner

495
00:23:14,033 --> 00:23:16,400
Managed to separate himself
from the rest of the team.

496
00:23:16,467 --> 00:23:19,300
He didn't "manage"
to do that.

497
00:23:19,367 --> 00:23:22,200
When marshal kassmeyer
was in the ambulance--

498
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:23,467
Agent hotchner volunteered
to ride along.

499
00:23:23,534 --> 00:23:25,601
To get answers before
he lost consciousness.

500
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:27,067
Why didn't you
go with him?

501
00:23:27,133 --> 00:23:28,234
It didn't seem necessary.

502
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,534
Did you tell you that?

503
00:23:30,501 --> 00:23:32,801
Is that what
you're looking for,

504
00:23:32,868 --> 00:23:35,467
A way to blame this
on him?

505
00:23:35,534 --> 00:23:37,734
What good could that
possibly do?

506
00:23:37,801 --> 00:23:39,767
Agent hotchner was looking
for an opportunity

507
00:23:39,834 --> 00:23:41,868
To separate himself
from the team
and he found one.

508
00:23:41,934 --> 00:23:43,100
That isn't true.

509
00:23:43,167 --> 00:23:45,667
He was desperate
and he didn't want someone

510
00:23:45,734 --> 00:23:48,100
With a clear head
to stop him.

511
00:23:48,167 --> 00:23:50,701
Is there a question
in there somewhere?

512
00:23:52,234 --> 00:23:56,267
Tell me what happened
while agent hotchner
was in the ambulance.

513
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:59,234
We contacted
the u.s. marshals.

514
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,601
They said haley
was in the wind.

515
00:24:00,667 --> 00:24:02,100
She had dumped
her cell phone,

516
00:24:02,167 --> 00:24:03,601
So there was no way
to track her.

517
00:24:03,667 --> 00:24:06,667
And how did agent hotchner
react to that news?

518
00:24:07,934 --> 00:24:10,567
Foyet called haley
from kassmeyer's phone.

519
00:24:10,634 --> 00:24:12,601
All right, we'll get
garcia to trace it. jj.

520
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:14,634
He told her she was
compromised and i was dead.

521
00:24:14,701 --> 00:24:16,200
Well, have you called her?

522
00:24:16,267 --> 00:24:18,400
No. he said to throw
her phone away
and to buy a disposable.

523
00:24:18,467 --> 00:24:19,901
Hotch, we're gonna
come get you right now.

524
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:21,467
No, anderson's
bringing me a car.

525
00:24:21,534 --> 00:24:22,968
You want to meet
back at the office?

526
00:24:23,033 --> 00:24:26,000
I'm hoping that she's just gonna
call me, at least, to check.

527
00:24:26,067 --> 00:24:29,534
Foyet posed as a marshal,
even called from a number
that haley recognized.

528
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:31,834
And then he did
what gets him off.
he scared her.

529
00:24:31,901 --> 00:24:34,601
Prentiss: no, he paralyzed
her. he overwhelmed her.

530
00:24:34,667 --> 00:24:36,033
And now she trusts him.
where do you think
he would take her?

531
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,801
Witness protection had her
living in new jersey.

532
00:24:37,868 --> 00:24:39,200
He has a head start.
he could be there now.

533
00:24:39,267 --> 00:24:40,968
Garcia's got a trace.

534
00:24:41,033 --> 00:24:42,801
He's bouncing between
a few towers.

535
00:24:42,868 --> 00:24:43,801
Where?

536
00:24:43,868 --> 00:24:45,100
Fairfax county.

537
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:46,267
He's still local?

538
00:24:46,334 --> 00:24:47,334
Send the coordinates
to my phone.

539
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,601
Done.

540
00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:50,868
Why isn't he on his way
to new jersey?

541
00:24:50,934 --> 00:24:52,067
Wait,
that phone's on?

542
00:24:52,133 --> 00:24:53,067
Yes.

543
00:24:53,133 --> 00:24:54,400
He hung up.
hotch?

544
00:24:54,467 --> 00:24:55,400
Damn it.

545
00:24:55,467 --> 00:24:56,300
[beeping]

546
00:24:56,367 --> 00:24:57,534
What's that?

547
00:24:57,601 --> 00:24:58,567
Hotch is calling foyet.

548
00:24:58,634 --> 00:25:00,767

00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:05,868
[ring]

550
00:25:08,501 --> 00:25:10,033
Agent hotchner.

551
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,601
If you touch her...

552
00:25:11,667 --> 00:25:14,501
Be gentle,
like i was with you?

553
00:25:14,567 --> 00:25:16,400
What the hell
took you so long?

554
00:25:16,467 --> 00:25:19,133
I was beginning to think
this phone was dead
or something.

555
00:25:20,133 --> 00:25:21,667
Why so quiet?

556
00:25:21,734 --> 00:25:23,767
You usually lash out
when you're frustrated.

557
00:25:23,834 --> 00:25:26,868
I'm not frustrated.
you're more predictable
than you think.

558
00:25:26,934 --> 00:25:27,901
Am i?

559
00:25:27,968 --> 00:25:29,467
You didn't know
where haley was,

560
00:25:29,534 --> 00:25:30,634
So you made her come to you.

561
00:25:30,701 --> 00:25:32,467
You make me sound lazy.

562
00:25:32,534 --> 00:25:34,133
Just another way
for you to show control.

563
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,567
Oh, that's terrible.

564
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:37,400
You're mother tried to protect
you from your father,

565
00:25:37,467 --> 00:25:38,667
But she wasn't strong enough.

566
00:25:38,734 --> 00:25:40,868
And you hated her
for that, didn't you?

567
00:25:40,934 --> 00:25:43,200
You decided that
all women were weak.

568
00:25:43,267 --> 00:25:45,567
Those are your words,
not mine.

569
00:25:45,634 --> 00:25:47,200
What were you,
9 when you killed them?

570
00:25:47,267 --> 00:25:48,234
It was a car accident.

571
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,634
That you couldn't
take credit for.

572
00:25:49,701 --> 00:25:51,067
That had to be
hard for you.

573
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:53,267
But poor george
got another chance.

574
00:25:53,334 --> 00:25:54,934
The little orphan
was saved

575
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,767
By the wealthy, sterile
eastside couple, the foyets.

576
00:25:57,834 --> 00:25:59,200
And the story
should have ended there.

577
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:01,934
I don't believe
in fairy tales. do you?

578
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,834
That's the thing, george.
this isn't a fairy tale.

579
00:26:03,901 --> 00:26:05,534
You don't have to write
this story.

580
00:26:05,601 --> 00:26:06,934
You don't have to do
any of this.

581
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,267
I know you're exhausted.

582
00:26:08,334 --> 00:26:09,901
Always looking
over your shoulder,

583
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:12,334
Always wondering when the
other shoe is gonna drop.

584
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,968
Haven't you gotten
what you wanted?

585
00:26:14,033 --> 00:26:16,434
You've set yourself apart
from anybody we've ever
dealt with.

586
00:26:16,501 --> 00:26:18,534
You're not just
a famous serial killer,
you're the reaper.

587
00:26:18,601 --> 00:26:22,167
We're gonna study you
and your methods
for years and years.

588
00:26:24,234 --> 00:26:28,167
You know what
i've been thinking?

589
00:26:28,234 --> 00:26:30,734
Haley looks pretty good
with dark hair.

590
00:26:30,801 --> 00:26:32,567
She's lost some weight.

591
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:35,901
Must be all the stress
you caused her.

592
00:26:35,968 --> 00:26:38,467
Where's the little man?

593
00:26:38,534 --> 00:26:41,267
Oh. there he is.

594
00:26:41,334 --> 00:26:44,300
Does he like captain america
because of you?

00:26:48,767 --> 00:26:50,234

Mrs. hotchner.

00:26:55,734 --> 00:26:57,667
I'm here.

601
00:26:57,734 --> 00:26:59,634
Open the gate
and i'll drive in.

602
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,234
Ok.

603
00:27:04,734 --> 00:27:05,834
Aaron?

604
00:27:05,901 --> 00:27:08,734
I really gotta go.

00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:18,067
Strauss: and you still
didn't know where foyet was?

607
00:27:18,133 --> 00:27:20,133
The phone belonged
to a u.s. marshal.

608
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,767
It was designed to
bounce between towers,

609
00:27:21,834 --> 00:27:24,267
So we could not pinpoint
his location.

610
00:27:24,334 --> 00:27:26,767
And agent hotchner
was driving around aimlessly.

611
00:27:26,834 --> 00:27:28,067
No.

612
00:27:28,133 --> 00:27:30,601
He wasn't.

613
00:27:30,667 --> 00:27:31,968
We had foyet's profile,

614
00:27:32,033 --> 00:27:33,400
And we knew
if we followed it,

615
00:27:33,467 --> 00:27:35,834
We would know were
he took hotch's family.

616
00:27:35,901 --> 00:27:37,567
All right, foyet
has to be in control.

617
00:27:37,634 --> 00:27:39,067
He had haley
come to him.

618
00:27:39,133 --> 00:27:40,434
Yeah, but where
would he take her?

619
00:27:40,501 --> 00:27:43,033
He'd want hotch to find him,
to see where he was,

620
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,667
Which means he--
to see what he did.

621
00:27:44,734 --> 00:27:45,801
He said something
on that call

622
00:27:45,868 --> 00:27:47,667
That tells hotch
where to go.

623
00:27:47,734 --> 00:27:48,968
Reid, what did he say,
exactly?

624
00:27:49,033 --> 00:27:51,067
"haley's hair looks good dark.

Hi. open the gate

630
00:27:58,267 --> 00:27:59,367
Open the gate?

631
00:27:59,434 --> 00:28:00,467
It would be someplace

632
00:28:00,534 --> 00:28:02,501
With the biggest
emotional impact for hotch.

633
00:28:02,567 --> 00:28:03,567
And haley has access
to the gate.

634
00:28:03,634 --> 00:28:05,767
Their house,
where they lived together.

635
00:28:05,834 --> 00:28:07,100
Of course. foyet planned
this all the way to the end.

636
00:28:07,167 --> 00:28:08,834
It's everything to him.

637
00:28:08,901 --> 00:28:10,234
He wants to take over
hotch's home

638
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:14,067
To be in control
to prove his dominance.

650
00:28:32,467 --> 00:28:35,667
You're ok?

651
00:28:35,734 --> 00:28:37,501
I'm fine.

652
00:28:37,567 --> 00:28:38,501
But...

653
00:28:38,567 --> 00:28:40,100
He said that...

654
00:28:42,868 --> 00:28:44,501
Oh, aaron.

655
00:28:44,567 --> 00:28:45,868
He can hear us, right?

656
00:28:45,934 --> 00:28:47,100
Yes.

00:28:47,167 --> 00:28:48,734
I am so sorry.

00:28:51,467 --> 00:28:52,567
No fear.

660
00:28:52,634 --> 00:28:54,367
I know.

661
00:28:54,434 --> 00:28:57,334
Sam told me
all about him.

662
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,601
Is he, uh--

663
00:28:59,667 --> 00:29:00,701
No, sam is fine.

664
00:29:00,767 --> 00:29:02,601
Foyet: aaron, aaron, aaron.

665
00:29:02,667 --> 00:29:04,501
Is that why
your marriage broke up,

666
00:29:04,567 --> 00:29:05,834
Because you're a liar?

667
00:29:05,901 --> 00:29:07,133
Don't listen to him, haley.

668
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,968
I have sam's service phone
right here.

669
00:29:09,033 --> 00:29:11,334
They sent out a mass text
about his death.

670
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,367
You can take a look
if you want.

00:29:13,434 --> 00:29:15,033
He's trying to scare you.

672
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,601
Did you even tell her
what this was about?

00:29:16,667 --> 00:29:18,300
About the deal?

to know this part either.

He's so cute.

705
00:30:50,467 --> 00:30:52,934
He's like a little
junior g-man.

706
00:30:54,501 --> 00:30:57,434
I'll be right up,
jackie boy!

707
00:30:57,501 --> 00:30:59,834
Is he gone?

708
00:30:59,901 --> 00:31:01,100
Yes.

709
00:31:01,167 --> 00:31:04,133
You're so strong, haley.
you're stronger than i ever was.

710
00:31:08,701 --> 00:31:11,267
You'll hurry, right?

711
00:31:11,334 --> 00:31:14,901
I know you didn't sign on
for this.

712
00:31:14,968 --> 00:31:17,734
Neither did you.

713
00:31:17,801 --> 00:31:20,634
I'm sorry for everything.

714
00:31:22,868 --> 00:31:27,133
Promise me that you will
tell him how we met

715
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,000
And how you used to
make me laugh.

716
00:31:29,067 --> 00:31:30,434
Haley...

717
00:31:30,501 --> 00:31:35,467
He needs to know
that you weren't always
so serious, aaron.

718
00:31:37,901 --> 00:31:39,834
I want him
to believe in love,

719
00:31:39,901 --> 00:31:44,868
Because it is the most
important thing.

720
00:31:44,934 --> 00:31:46,667
But you need to show him.

721
00:31:46,734 --> 00:31:49,133
Promise me.

722
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,133

Hotch, stop.

739
00:37:53,234 --> 00:37:54,400
It's over.

740
00:37:54,467 --> 00:37:56,167
It's over.

741
00:37:56,234 --> 00:37:58,901

You did a great job, buddy.

749
00:38:42,133 --> 00:38:44,634

daddy?

750

[sobbing]

756
00:40:11,801 --> 00:40:14,367
There was nothing
i could do for her.

757
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,400
She was already...

758
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:38,534
She died fairly quickly.

759
00:40:38,601 --> 00:40:40,167
One of the wounds
severed her aorta,

760
00:40:40,234 --> 00:40:42,801
And they don't think
that she...

761
00:40:48,968 --> 00:40:53,234
And they don't think
she suffered much.

762
00:40:55,334 --> 00:40:57,868
Agent hotchner, what do you
think would have happened

763
00:40:57,934 --> 00:41:01,667
If george foyet had gotten up
from that floor?

764
00:41:01,734 --> 00:41:04,601
If you didn't kill him?

765
00:41:06,968 --> 00:41:12,601
I don't have to think.
i know he would have tried
to kill my son, too.

766
00:41:14,868 --> 00:41:17,300
That's good enough for me.

767
00:41:19,934 --> 00:41:22,667
Any questions?

768
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,400
Agent hotchner.

769
00:41:36,234 --> 00:41:40,100
I'm so sorry for your loss.

770
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:41,767
And...

771
00:41:41,834 --> 00:41:45,300
If you or your son
need anything...

772
00:41:45,367 --> 00:41:48,801
Thank you.
