1
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,104


2
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,800


3
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,018
Detective Forward,

4
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,199
you got a visitor.

5
00:00:34,548 --> 00:00:35,775
I'm not here.

6
00:00:35,954 --> 00:00:37,700
It's Sandra Lombardini

7
00:00:47,409 --> 00:00:49,075
the body we found in the woods...

8
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,100
It wasn't Brooke.

9
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:54,969
Do you know who?

10
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,722
It was Lynette Hagen.

11
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:00,358
Her parents just
identified the remains.

12
00:01:03,106 --> 00:01:05,306
We have people searching the area,

13
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,274
but the rain's making it tough.

14
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,996
You should try to get some sleep,
Sandra.

15
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:13,625
I can't.

16
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,034
Not without knowing.

17
00:01:20,823 --> 00:01:23,351
Ron, I need something from you.

18
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,850
- Anything.
- The necklace...

19
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:28,500
Brooke's...

20
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,965
The one you found
on the ground by the car.

21
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,775
That's in evidence.

22
00:01:32,996 --> 00:01:34,927
Something like that
may take some time.

23
00:01:35,215 --> 00:01:36,215
Please.

24
00:01:36,952 --> 00:01:37,888
I need it.

25
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:41,969
May I ask you why?

26
00:01:42,604 --> 00:01:44,764
He says it could tell him things.

27
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,157
What is it?

28
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,300
What did you see?

29
00:02:52,807 --> 00:02:56,609
"Current influences should turn this day
into one with plenty of potential,

30
00:02:56,734 --> 00:02:58,675
"but avoid the trap
of trying too hard.

31
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,557
"Know your strengths.
Rely on them.

32
00:03:00,682 --> 00:03:04,225
Confidence, real or pretend,
is your magic ingredient."

33
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:05,875
Confidence.
Yes, I like that.

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,559
You don't think there's actually
anything to that stuff?

35
00:03:08,684 --> 00:03:10,675
- You'd be surprised.
- It's gibberish.

36
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:14,276
You are jealous because you don't have
the magic ingredient.

37
00:03:14,445 --> 00:03:16,779
I have the magic ingredient.
It's called splenda.

38
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,031
All right, skeptic,
what's your sign?

39
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,990
No... Is that in April?

40
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,875
- Reid, we need a d.o.b. on Prentiss.
- 7:12 a.m., October 12, 19...

41
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:27,665
Libra...

42
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,821
"A romantic opportunity
may experience a slight hitch

43
00:03:30,946 --> 00:03:32,829
"thanks to the pesky lunar influence

44
00:03:32,954 --> 00:03:36,122
"which could have you dipping
into a rather chilly mood.

45
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,050
"If being demonstrative
and warm is difficult,

46
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,214
"then neutralize
this temporary cold front

47
00:03:41,339 --> 00:03:43,114
with a simple
but affectionate gesture."

48
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:44,684
I have a simple gesture.

49
00:03:45,981 --> 00:03:48,046
- Ready to gather?
- Look at you, Miss thing.

50
00:03:48,171 --> 00:03:49,824
First day back
and you're all business.

51
00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:53,147
It's either dive right in
or confront my separation anxiety.

52
00:03:53,475 --> 00:03:55,196
It's tough being away from him?

53
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:58,178
That's new, isn't it?

54
00:03:58,303 --> 00:04:00,281
Yeah, citrine.
It's Henry's birthstone.

55
00:04:00,925 --> 00:04:03,659
- Will and I both got one.
- Oh, that's sweet.

56
00:04:04,196 --> 00:04:06,446
- You done with this?
- All yours.

57
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,922
There's been a string of abductions
in Olympia, Washington,

58
00:04:12,047 --> 00:04:14,437
going back 9 months.
4 women in all,

59
00:04:14,562 --> 00:04:15,838
blond, blue-eyed,

60
00:04:16,397 --> 00:04:17,284
early 20s.

61
00:04:17,409 --> 00:04:18,883
This morning they found one.

62
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:21,175
- When were they taken?
- 9 months ago.

63
00:04:21,445 --> 00:04:23,053
So she was the first?

64
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,250
Looks almost mummified.

65
00:04:25,451 --> 00:04:26,775
Not exactly.

66
00:04:27,136 --> 00:04:28,851
- Frozen?
- Embalmed.

67
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,297
That's different.

68
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,354
So the time of death is a bit
of a question mark right now.

69
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,719
- Where did they find her?
- In a state park just east of Olympia.

70
00:04:36,844 --> 00:04:37,946
Seasonal hiking area.

71
00:04:38,071 --> 00:04:39,975
The body was jarred loose
during a mudslide.

72
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,947
That, plus the abnormal decomp

73
00:04:42,303 --> 00:04:45,058
makes it difficult to know
how long she was there.

74
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,600
It says the victims were
abducted about 3 months apart.

75
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,455
He's rotating his victims out.

76
00:04:49,746 --> 00:04:51,206
There are gonna be more bodies.

77
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:06,045
Synchro: mpm

78
00:05:35,066 --> 00:05:37,085
<i>"And so, all the night tide</i>

79
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,875
<i>"I lay down by the side</i>

80
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,850
<i>"of my darling, my darling,</i>

81
00:05:41,201 --> 00:05:42,775
<i>"my life and my bride,</i>

82
00:05:43,077 --> 00:05:45,100
<i>"in the sepulcher there by the sea,</i>

83
00:05:45,488 --> 00:05:48,096
<i>in her tomb by the sounding sea."</i>

84
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,600
<i>Edgar Allen Poe.</i>

85
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,375
So if I wanted to embalm a body,

86
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,100
well, what's the process?

87
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,817
Start with some nose plugs.

88
00:05:56,942 --> 00:06:00,359
The blood is drained through the jugular
vein and replaced with embalming fluid

89
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,861
through onethe major arteries.
It usually takes a few hours.

90
00:06:02,986 --> 00:06:05,114
Then you'd need
special equipment, training.

91
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:07,865
Knowledge of the human
vascular system would also be a plus.

92
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:08,999
A doctor.

93
00:06:09,124 --> 00:06:11,870
A nurse, technician, somebody
with a background in mortuary sciences.

94
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,796
There's a major
they didn't offer at my school.

95
00:06:13,921 --> 00:06:15,675
The whole thing seems weird to me.

96
00:06:15,877 --> 00:06:18,836
Embalming, I mean. Some people like
to look good for their funeral.

97
00:06:19,005 --> 00:06:20,879
But it's not them.
It's just a shell,

98
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,771
polished and painted.
I just want to be cremated.

99
00:06:23,896 --> 00:06:27,049
The question is why embalm the body
of someone you murdered.

100
00:06:27,174 --> 00:06:30,090
He wants to hold on to them.
It's a possession issue.

101
00:06:30,215 --> 00:06:31,640
This way they can never leave.

102
00:06:32,272 --> 00:06:34,184
Maybe fear of abandonment
speaks to his history.

103
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,601
But eventually even
an embalmed body will decay

104
00:06:36,726 --> 00:06:38,647
and he finds himself
in need of new victims.

105
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,879
That explains the abduction cycle...
A new victim every 3 months.

106
00:06:42,004 --> 00:06:44,358
Which means at least 2
of the remaining women

107
00:06:44,483 --> 00:06:45,737
are already dead.

108
00:06:46,086 --> 00:06:47,948
- And the third?
- Brooke Lombardini.

109
00:06:48,117 --> 00:06:50,116
It's been 4 days since she...

110
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,149
disappeared following her shift
at a local restaurant.

111
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,954
We know the odds.

112
00:06:55,124 --> 00:06:58,792
90% of all abduction victims
are killed within the first 36 hours.

113
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,700
Hiker found a foot protruding
from the soil right up here.

114
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,675
Whole side of the hill
slid down from up there.

115
00:07:19,929 --> 00:07:22,214
So you're focusing the search
in this area here.

116
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:24,294
Yeah, but if he dumped
other bodies here,

117
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:26,375
he's got over 800 acres
to work with.

118
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,121
Keep your men near the fire road.

119
00:07:28,246 --> 00:07:30,105
One man dragging a body
through the woods...

120
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,779
110 pounds of dead weight,
he's not gonna get far from the path.

121
00:07:32,904 --> 00:07:36,275
That's why they dismember
the victims. They're easier to dispose.

122
00:07:36,591 --> 00:07:39,228
You think it says something about
the profile, he didn't chop her up?

123
00:07:39,353 --> 00:07:40,603
Possibly, yeah.

124
00:07:48,329 --> 00:07:49,379
What is it?

125
00:07:52,254 --> 00:07:53,055
Detective.

126
00:07:53,843 --> 00:07:55,805
We got... We got something up here.

127
00:08:09,236 --> 00:08:11,900
The answer to your question,
detective, is yes,

128
00:08:12,535 --> 00:08:14,700
this killer can't
dismember these women.

129
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,790
He cares for them.

130
00:08:18,302 --> 00:08:21,302
Brooke worked the closing shift
the night she disappeared.

131
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:24,402
She would have walked
this way to her car.

132
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,402
Upscale restaurant?

133
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:28,777
Well, let's just say that I don't go

134
00:08:28,902 --> 00:08:31,002
unless it's on someone else's dime.

135
00:08:31,497 --> 00:08:32,671
What are you thinking?

136
00:08:32,796 --> 00:08:35,202
These women were taken
as they left work.

137
00:08:35,739 --> 00:08:38,077
High-end spa,
nice restaurant, jewelry store.

138
00:08:38,202 --> 00:08:40,686
If he patronizes these businesses,
then he's got money.

139
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:42,493
It narrows the profile a little.

140
00:08:42,618 --> 00:08:45,602
The cook said that he left
just a few minutes after Brooke.

141
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,177
Saw her car there,
driver's side door open.

142
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,977
He was quick.
Surprised her.

143
00:08:50,102 --> 00:08:53,077
11 p. m., it was dark, he had cover.
She probably never saw him coming.

144
00:08:53,202 --> 00:08:56,836
It says in here they recovered
her necklace, amethyst, broken chain?

145
00:08:57,351 --> 00:08:59,037
Right here, right next to the car.

146
00:09:01,337 --> 00:09:04,338
- Did you process the necklace?
- We couldn't get anything off of it.

147
00:09:04,573 --> 00:09:06,481
Just some hair in the clasp.

148
00:09:06,606 --> 00:09:08,589
- Hers.
- I'd like to take a look at it.

149
00:09:09,773 --> 00:09:11,592
I gave it back to her mother.

150
00:09:13,106 --> 00:09:15,781
Isn't it a little premature to be
returning evidence to the family?

151
00:09:16,078 --> 00:09:18,097
There were special circumstances.

152
00:09:18,494 --> 00:09:19,781
She hired someone.

153
00:09:19,998 --> 00:09:22,106
Guy by the name of Stanley Usher.

154
00:09:22,658 --> 00:09:24,815
He helped find a kid
in Portland a couple years ago.

155
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,148
Private investigator?

156
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:27,774
A psychic.

157
00:09:30,099 --> 00:09:31,678
What does that have to do?

158
00:09:31,803 --> 00:09:34,364
Apparently he can read
personal things...

159
00:09:35,606 --> 00:09:36,593
Their aura.

160
00:09:36,806 --> 00:09:37,809
I don't know.

161
00:09:40,206 --> 00:09:41,706
So what did he tell her?

162
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,142
<i>I know Brooke is still alive.</i>

163
00:09:46,706 --> 00:09:49,129
<i>It's not too late for you
to do the right thing.</i>

164
00:09:49,806 --> 00:09:51,381
<i>Let her come home to me.</i>

165
00:09:51,506 --> 00:09:53,847
<i>She turns 27 on Wednesday.</i>

166
00:09:54,806 --> 00:09:57,368
Wish she would have waited until
we had a chance to coach her.

167
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,129
I don't know, she seems
to be doing a pretty good job.

168
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:03,002
Good enough to make the unsub
think twice about killing Brooke.

169
00:10:03,301 --> 00:10:04,706
If he hasn't already.

170
00:10:05,236 --> 00:10:07,022
Chances are this is all too late.

171
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:09,608
It's her daughter.
She has to have hope, right?

172
00:10:10,206 --> 00:10:12,526
Hope's one thing.
False hope is something else.

173
00:10:12,806 --> 00:10:14,906
I guess you've worked
with psychics before?

174
00:10:15,306 --> 00:10:17,366
Yeah. Not by choice.

175
00:10:18,006 --> 00:10:20,826
You know, there are cases where
people believe they've helped.

176
00:10:21,102 --> 00:10:22,806
When people are vulnerable,

177
00:10:23,606 --> 00:10:25,465
they'll believe a lot of things.

178
00:10:28,106 --> 00:10:30,906
We think the man who took her,

179
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:32,781
may have come by her work.

180
00:10:32,906 --> 00:10:35,681
A customer, someone
she may have talked about.

181
00:10:35,806 --> 00:10:39,785
We think he is a loner. He would dine
by himself, make frequent visits.

182
00:10:40,638 --> 00:10:43,432
But he's shy, avoids eye contact.

183
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:47,181
- She got asked out sometimes.
- This man wouldn't have asked her out.

184
00:10:47,306 --> 00:10:48,789
He wouldn't have had the courage.

185
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:51,691
He would have stared at her,
made her uncomfortable.

186
00:10:54,306 --> 00:10:56,529
I've told the police
everything I know.

187
00:10:57,006 --> 00:10:59,866
You shouldn't be here.
You should be looking into the clues.

188
00:11:01,006 --> 00:11:03,661
Right.
Clues from Brooke's necklace.

189
00:11:04,006 --> 00:11:06,862
Yes, sir. It's called
token object reading, or...

190
00:11:06,987 --> 00:11:08,165
Psychometry.

191
00:11:09,006 --> 00:11:10,677
Yeah. You're not my first.

192
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:14,880
A fenced-in area, the color orange,

193
00:11:15,367 --> 00:11:17,778
and the numbers 8, 6, 7.

194
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,596
Does that help you?

195
00:11:23,306 --> 00:11:24,481
So, Mr. Usher,

196
00:11:25,006 --> 00:11:27,019
by touching a personal item,

197
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,979
you think that you can tell
if someone's alive or dead.

198
00:11:30,306 --> 00:11:31,306
Sometimes.

199
00:11:32,306 --> 00:11:34,481
See, a person's energy
makes an impression

200
00:11:34,606 --> 00:11:36,081
on everything they touch.

201
00:11:36,206 --> 00:11:37,816
It allows me to connect with them.

202
00:11:38,606 --> 00:11:41,406
The hard part is
interpreting what I'm given.

203
00:11:41,808 --> 00:11:43,808
Did you get anything else

204
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:45,953
about her condition?

205
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:47,496
Only that she...

206
00:11:48,545 --> 00:11:50,166
Felt weakened, tired.

207
00:11:51,726 --> 00:11:52,976
I don't know...

208
00:11:53,252 --> 00:11:54,746
- Heavy.
- Heavy.

209
00:11:55,706 --> 00:11:57,509
Can I talk to you for a second?

210
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:04,406
I've been around a little,

211
00:12:05,006 --> 00:12:06,281
and I've seen guys like you

212
00:12:06,406 --> 00:12:08,481
come into the lives
of grieving families.

213
00:12:08,606 --> 00:12:11,511
- Sir, I assure you, that's not what...
- Listen to me.

214
00:12:11,636 --> 00:12:13,365
The last thing this woman needs

215
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:16,381
is some con man
giving her unrealistic ideas.

216
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,586
With all due respect, sir,
you may not know what she needs.

217
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:23,581
- Your job is to know the perpetrators.
- We're not talking about my job.

218
00:12:23,706 --> 00:12:24,950
Well, maybe we should be.

219
00:12:25,306 --> 00:12:28,506
Because there are a lot of people who
don't believe in what you do, either.

220
00:12:34,007 --> 00:12:35,306
I just got a call.

221
00:12:35,606 --> 00:12:37,005
They found a third body.

222
00:12:39,006 --> 00:12:42,381
Annette Hagen, Erin Bonham,
and Melissa st. Claire,

223
00:12:42,506 --> 00:12:43,781
all embalmed.

224
00:12:43,906 --> 00:12:46,906
That's the first 3. That leaves the
Lombardini girl still out there.

225
00:12:48,096 --> 00:12:50,381
- Did you figure out cause of death?
- Blood loss.

226
00:12:50,506 --> 00:12:53,281
Blood loss? They were alive
when they were embalmed?

227
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:54,355
Looks that way.

228
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:57,381
Tox screens show
significant levels of barbiturate.

229
00:12:57,506 --> 00:12:58,869
They were sedated,

230
00:12:59,114 --> 00:13:00,341
maybe unconscious.

231
00:13:00,806 --> 00:13:02,581
Look. They all have
the same haircut.

232
00:13:02,706 --> 00:13:04,941
These are recent photos.
These two had much longer hair

233
00:13:05,066 --> 00:13:07,781
- at the time of their abduction.
- So the unsub cut it.

234
00:13:07,906 --> 00:13:09,621
Something else he may have done.

235
00:13:10,006 --> 00:13:11,831
Their ears have
all been double-pierced.

236
00:13:15,206 --> 00:13:16,669
Were they sexually assaulted?

237
00:13:17,206 --> 00:13:18,295
Not exactly.

238
00:13:18,571 --> 00:13:22,106
There was no tearing or bruising
that would normally suggest it.

239
00:13:22,357 --> 00:13:24,301
But I did find
trace amounts of semen.

240
00:13:24,864 --> 00:13:26,595
You're saying it
may've been consensual?

241
00:13:28,306 --> 00:13:30,006
She's saying they were dead.

242
00:13:34,706 --> 00:13:37,481
I spoke to the families. None
of the victims had double-pierced ears

243
00:13:37,606 --> 00:13:39,581
at the time of their abduction.

244
00:13:39,706 --> 00:13:41,452
Cutting hair and piercing ears.

245
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:43,612
He's changing them.

246
00:13:44,506 --> 00:13:46,574
- Into what, though?
- Into who.

247
00:13:47,606 --> 00:13:49,535
The burial suggests
an affection for his victims.

248
00:13:49,811 --> 00:13:52,381
Which says he might be remaking them
into the image of a loved one.

249
00:13:52,506 --> 00:13:54,957
The m.e. found high
levels of barbiturate?

250
00:13:55,233 --> 00:13:55,958
Why?

251
00:13:56,234 --> 00:13:58,085
Just something the psychic said...

252
00:13:58,506 --> 00:14:00,963
That Brooke felt tired, heavy.

253
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,470
Why are we talking about the psychic?
It's a scam.

254
00:14:03,595 --> 00:14:05,981
These guys talk without saying anythin
and you fall for it.

255
00:14:06,106 --> 00:14:08,681
He said that Brooke's alive,
so I guess I want to believe him.

256
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:10,097
You know the profile.

257
00:14:10,373 --> 00:14:13,381
A necrophiliac
has no use for a live victim.

258
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:15,066
You ready to talk to them?

259
00:14:22,106 --> 00:14:24,806
Garcia, I need you to run
a full background check for me.

260
00:14:25,106 --> 00:14:26,581
Name's Usher,

261
00:14:26,706 --> 00:14:28,450
Stanley Usher.

262
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:32,349
By now we know the DNA found
did not match anyone in the system,

263
00:14:32,474 --> 00:14:35,806
we're gonna have to look beyond physical
evidence to identify the killer.

264
00:14:36,116 --> 00:14:38,876
Our unsub is a white male
in his mid- to late 20s,

265
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,381
and he has money.

266
00:14:40,506 --> 00:14:42,755
He lives alone,
in a large residence.

267
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:46,481
There's enough space and ventilation
to accommodate an embalming suite.

268
00:14:46,606 --> 00:14:48,581
He's awkward with people,
especially women.

269
00:14:48,706 --> 00:14:51,781
An inability to relate socially
is common in homicidal necrophiles.

270
00:14:51,906 --> 00:14:55,560
Because of the alterations, we believe
the unsub is attempting to recreate

271
00:14:55,685 --> 00:14:56,936
a woman he once loved.

272
00:14:57,212 --> 00:14:59,381
- Like a girlfriend?
- Or a wife, a mother.

273
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,781
Someone who left or died suddenly.

274
00:15:01,906 --> 00:15:05,853
This projection of the loved one coupled
with his need to preserve the victims

275
00:15:05,978 --> 00:15:09,681
is similar to the psychopathology
of serial murderer Ed Gein.

276
00:15:09,806 --> 00:15:11,595
Gein had an oedipal complex
which developed

277
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,306
in the years he nursed his
paralyzed mother back from a stroke.

278
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,547
After she died,
his obsession compelled him

279
00:15:16,672 --> 00:15:19,581
to dig up corpses of women
who resembled his mother.

280
00:15:19,706 --> 00:15:22,442
So persistent was his desire
to resurrect his dead mother

281
00:15:22,567 --> 00:15:25,677
that he actually dressed
in female suits

282
00:15:25,802 --> 00:15:27,602
fashioned from human skin.

283
00:15:28,106 --> 00:15:29,681
Eventually, Gein grew unhappy

284
00:15:29,806 --> 00:15:32,881
with the flesh of dead bodies,
which had a tendency to dry and crack,

285
00:15:33,006 --> 00:15:36,681
so he shifted his focus to live victims
whose bodies he could better preserve.

286
00:15:36,806 --> 00:15:38,481
The evolution from
dead to live victims

287
00:15:38,606 --> 00:15:41,306
will also be mirrored
in our unsub's maturation.

288
00:15:41,506 --> 00:15:45,281
We've put together a list
of incident reports prior to 2006.

289
00:15:45,406 --> 00:15:47,181
You're gonna want to
follow up on these.

290
00:15:47,306 --> 00:15:49,481
Now, they are inappropriate
postmortem conduct,

291
00:15:49,606 --> 00:15:52,181
cadaver theft,
and graveyard disturbances.

292
00:15:52,306 --> 00:15:54,481
60% of necrophiles
work in the death business,

293
00:15:54,606 --> 00:15:57,481
so be sure to canvass local cemeteries,
mortuaries, and morgues.

294
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,251
We have the killer's DNA, so
we're gonna be sending you out with kits

295
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:01,959
to swab potential suspects.

296
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,481
The odds of finding Brooke
Lombardini alive are slim,

297
00:16:04,606 --> 00:16:07,281
but the quicker we identify the killer,
the better her chances are.

298
00:16:07,406 --> 00:16:09,406
For her sake, let's work fast.

299
00:16:11,006 --> 00:16:12,656
That lawsuit is a joke.

300
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:16,881
It's my job to prep the deceased.
I was simply adjusting her clothing.

301
00:16:17,006 --> 00:16:18,642
By adjusting you mean undressing?

302
00:16:20,306 --> 00:16:23,906
Look, man, I'm not here to judge you.
I'm looking for a killer.

303
00:16:24,606 --> 00:16:27,360
So if you want to prove your innocence,
all you gotta do is say "ahh".

304
00:16:27,906 --> 00:16:30,581
We're looking for instances
where graves have been disturbed...

305
00:16:30,706 --> 00:16:32,781
Desecrations, exhumations.

306
00:16:32,906 --> 00:16:34,106
Female bodies.

307
00:16:34,531 --> 00:16:35,981
Attractive ones.

308
00:16:36,106 --> 00:16:38,406
Nobody's attractive
once they've been in the ground.

309
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:40,481
They would have been recent burials.

310
00:16:40,606 --> 00:16:42,645
No, haven't had anything like that.

311
00:16:43,706 --> 00:16:46,170
An older grave got ransacked
a couple years ago.

312
00:16:46,446 --> 00:16:49,548
- Was the body taken?
- No. The body was just a pile of bones.

313
00:16:50,106 --> 00:16:51,581
They stripped it clean, though.

314
00:16:51,706 --> 00:16:53,906
Made off with the jewelry, dress.

315
00:16:56,606 --> 00:16:57,581
I won't lie.

316
00:16:58,032 --> 00:17:00,476
It... It happens in the industry.

317
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:04,064
- And we put a stop to it when it does.
- You don't report it to the police?

318
00:17:05,035 --> 00:17:08,609
Well, we... Like to keep
that kind of thing quiet.

319
00:17:09,606 --> 00:17:12,181
A killer is dressing up his dead victims
and violating them.

320
00:17:12,306 --> 00:17:14,282
Maybe quiet isn't
the best way to go.

321
00:17:15,106 --> 00:17:16,200
He dresses them up?

322
00:17:17,206 --> 00:17:18,725
That mean something to you?

323
00:17:20,111 --> 00:17:22,181
We hired an apprentice a while back.

324
00:17:22,306 --> 00:17:24,606
Odd guy.
Even for this business.

325
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,544
I didn't like the attention
he paid the female cadavers.

326
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,381
I come to find out
he liked to do their makeup.

327
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,406
Put a wig on them and such.

328
00:17:32,906 --> 00:17:34,795
Can you describe the wig for me?

329
00:17:35,078 --> 00:17:37,706
We cleaned out his locker
after his termination.

330
00:17:38,085 --> 00:17:39,406
There she is.

331
00:17:41,406 --> 00:17:42,906
He never came back for it.

332
00:17:43,106 --> 00:17:44,306
Imagine that.

333
00:17:44,692 --> 00:17:46,106
I need this man's name.

334
00:17:58,506 --> 00:17:59,806
Ivan Bakunas?

335
00:18:00,806 --> 00:18:02,281
Yeah. Can I...
Can I help you?

336
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,748
You could invite us inside.
It's a little wet out here.

337
00:18:05,706 --> 00:18:07,681
Oh, I... I can't.
Mother's sleeping.

338
00:18:07,806 --> 00:18:09,981
We're investigating a series
of murders in the area.

339
00:18:10,106 --> 00:18:11,964
We believe the killer
works in your field.

340
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:14,981
Wow. Jeez. You're kidding.
Do I know him?

341
00:18:15,106 --> 00:18:17,481
You might. His victims
are just your type.

342
00:18:17,606 --> 00:18:19,406
Blond hair, blue skin.

343
00:18:21,447 --> 00:18:23,281
You're suggesting
I'm some kind of murderer?

344
00:18:23,406 --> 00:18:25,306
Then you are way out of line.

345
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,647
So you wouldn't object to
giving us a sample of your DNA.

346
00:18:30,106 --> 00:18:31,275
I don't know. No.

347
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:32,706
We can get a warrant.

348
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:36,793
I think I've said all I'm gonna say.

349
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,587
<i>Did you find anything
on Ivan Bakunas?</i>

350
00:18:39,712 --> 00:18:40,951
Nothing in juvey.

351
00:18:41,184 --> 00:18:42,870
But he was expelled
from Evergreen state

352
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,994
- for assaulting his girlfriend.
- Sexual?

353
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:47,833
He was slipping her tranquilizers
and having sex with her while she slept.

354
00:18:48,109 --> 00:18:49,376
That qualifies.

355
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,881
Oh, wait! Emily,
maybe this is that romantic encounter

356
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:53,298
your horoscope foretold.

357
00:18:55,406 --> 00:18:58,412
Between that and the wig,
we should be able to persuade a judge.

358
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:01,368
I'm not gonna stand in your way if you
want to serve a warrant on Bakunas,

359
00:19:01,493 --> 00:19:03,954
- but I think you're wasting your time.
- You're kidding, right?

360
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:06,644
We profiled a man of means.
According to his tax records,

361
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,081
Bakunas hasn't held down a job
since he graduated college.

362
00:19:09,206 --> 00:19:11,213
He lives with his mother.
Doesn't have a car.

363
00:19:11,338 --> 00:19:14,081
The embalming equipment, the drugs...
That stuff's not cheap.

364
00:19:14,206 --> 00:19:16,506
Look, this guys like
to get it on with dead people.

365
00:19:16,631 --> 00:19:19,156
If that's not probable cause,
I don't know what is.

366
00:19:19,751 --> 00:19:22,081
Hotch, a 911 operator
just got a distress call

367
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,585
from someone claiming
to be Brooke Lombardini.

368
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:26,881
<i>What's your emergency?</i>

369
00:19:27,006 --> 00:19:28,006
<i>Hello?</i>

370
00:19:28,506 --> 00:19:29,906
<i>Can you speak up, ma'am?</i>

371
00:19:31,467 --> 00:19:33,306
<i>He'll hear me.</i>

372
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:36,160
<i>This is Brooke Lombardini.</i>

373
00:19:36,506 --> 00:19:38,235
<i>Please, I need help.</i>

374
00:19:39,306 --> 00:19:40,881
<i>Where are you calling from, ma'am?</i>

375
00:19:41,006 --> 00:19:43,199
<i>I'm being held prisoner.</i>

376
00:19:44,006 --> 00:19:45,929
<i>OK, ma'am.
Can you look outside?</i>

377
00:19:46,054 --> 00:19:47,981
<i>Can you see a street name
or an address?</i>

378
00:19:48,106 --> 00:19:50,655
<i>Please...
I think he's...</i>

379
00:19:50,906 --> 00:19:52,606
<i>- Ma'am?
- Gonna kill me.</i>

380
00:19:53,106 --> 00:19:54,529
<i>Please help me.</i>

381
00:20:02,006 --> 00:20:04,681
- That's her. That's Brooke.
- You're certain?

382
00:20:04,806 --> 00:20:06,506
She's barely audible.

383
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:08,624
Any surveillance expert
will tell you

384
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:12,126
it's almost impossible to
positively identify a whisper.

385
00:20:12,906 --> 00:20:15,296
You think I don't know
my own daughter's voice?

386
00:20:15,804 --> 00:20:19,007
Why would someone who was not Brooke
call 911 and say they were?

387
00:20:19,406 --> 00:20:22,281
Sometimes people get off injecting
themselves into the story.

388
00:20:22,406 --> 00:20:23,512
You've been on TV now

389
00:20:23,796 --> 00:20:27,391
and that could bring out
a lot of sick individuals.

390
00:20:27,806 --> 00:20:29,381
Stanley said she was alive.

391
00:20:29,506 --> 00:20:30,769
This proves it.

392
00:20:31,045 --> 00:20:33,356
Stanley Usher has a vested
interest in telling you

393
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:34,940
that your daughter is alive.

394
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:38,781
And do you have a vested interest
in telling me that she's not?

395
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:40,404
He has a record, ma'am.

396
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,907
I had a colleague look into it.

397
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,806
Usher was charged with fraud
in Oregon...

398
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:51,706
Before he pulled up stakes
and moved here.

399
00:21:07,168 --> 00:21:09,300
I need my baby to be alive.

400
00:21:15,106 --> 00:21:16,891
All she has right now is hope.

401
00:21:18,406 --> 00:21:20,556
Why would you take that from her?

402
00:21:35,506 --> 00:21:38,481
You know, most people think
that a person's hair and nails

403
00:21:38,606 --> 00:21:40,706
continue to grow after they're dead.

404
00:21:42,006 --> 00:21:43,206
That's a myth.

405
00:21:45,006 --> 00:21:46,206
Abby...

406
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:49,456
Abby, hold still.

407
00:21:52,406 --> 00:21:54,806
I know how much
you like a straight line.

408
00:21:55,206 --> 00:21:56,256
Who's Abby?

409
00:21:57,106 --> 00:21:58,065
You're, silly.

410
00:22:03,597 --> 00:22:05,581
911 call came from
a disposable cell.

411
00:22:05,706 --> 00:22:07,750
No i.d., but they traced it
to the nearest tower

412
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:09,881
and that narrows it down
to a 20-mile radius here

413
00:22:10,006 --> 00:22:12,481
- just southeast of Seattle.
- That's a densely populated area.

414
00:22:12,606 --> 00:22:13,981
Were they able to triangulate?

415
00:22:14,106 --> 00:22:16,281
Garcia tried to ping the phone,
but it was already dead.

416
00:22:16,406 --> 00:22:18,335
The unsub probably turned it off.

417
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:21,681
- You mean if he found her.
- Dave, I agree with you about psychics,

418
00:22:21,806 --> 00:22:25,045
but the fact is Sandra Lombardini
identified her daughter's voice.

419
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:27,306
We have to assume
that that call was genuine.

420
00:22:28,706 --> 00:22:31,848
So what do we think?
Why is the unsub keeping Brooke alive?

421
00:22:32,169 --> 00:22:33,981
And how longshe has
until he kills her?

422
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:36,381
Maybe he needs them alive
to effect their transformation.

423
00:22:36,506 --> 00:22:39,781
The hair, makeup, piercing the ears...
That would only take a few hours.

424
00:22:39,985 --> 00:22:41,444
He's had her for almost 5 days.

425
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:44,881
So maybe it's about something more
than appearance.Something deeper.

426
00:22:45,006 --> 00:22:48,981
She made it sound like she was being
locked up, and she sounded drugged.

427
00:22:49,106 --> 00:22:52,381
These are control mechanisms used in
cases of sexual slavery, mind control...

428
00:22:52,506 --> 00:22:54,781
- It's brainwashing.
- So he's trying to break her down,

429
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:58,181
- make her surrender her identity.
- That's what he's waiting for.

430
00:22:58,306 --> 00:23:00,443
That's the version of them
he wants to hold onto.

431
00:23:00,568 --> 00:23:02,746
So the longer she holds out,
the longer she stays alive.

432
00:23:02,871 --> 00:23:04,624
And as soon as she accepts
her new role,

433
00:23:04,749 --> 00:23:06,206
her fate is sealed.

434
00:23:22,306 --> 00:23:23,906
Tell me a story, Abby.

435
00:23:24,606 --> 00:23:26,406
You know I can't sleep
without a story.

436
00:23:37,986 --> 00:23:39,306
Let me out.

437
00:23:39,806 --> 00:23:40,991
Story first, Abby.

438
00:23:41,606 --> 00:23:42,606
I told you,

439
00:23:43,529 --> 00:23:44,906
I'm not Abby.

440
00:24:10,806 --> 00:24:12,312
What did you do to me?

441
00:24:14,072 --> 00:24:15,406
Tell me a story, Abby.

442
00:24:18,106 --> 00:24:20,106
I told you, I'm not Abby!

443
00:24:28,206 --> 00:24:30,634
That was the lab with the
DNA results on those swabs.

444
00:24:31,056 --> 00:24:33,406
- No matches?
- No. Our guy's still out there.

445
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,023
What's he doing here?

446
00:24:37,506 --> 00:24:38,806
Detective, a word.

447
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:44,916
Do you know what you're doing?

448
00:24:46,106 --> 00:24:48,611
Can't afford to let my ego
get in the way on this one.

449
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:51,350
Take all the help I can get.

450
00:24:51,475 --> 00:24:53,381
Look, I'm happy to be
wrong about Brooke.

451
00:24:53,506 --> 00:24:56,451
Hell, I'm praying I am.
But I'm not wrong about this guy.

452
00:24:56,682 --> 00:24:58,506
Mr. Usher, good to see you again.

453
00:24:59,413 --> 00:25:00,413
And you.

454
00:25:03,225 --> 00:25:04,668
Can I help you with something?

455
00:25:06,506 --> 00:25:07,606
I'm spoken for.

456
00:25:11,706 --> 00:25:12,706
This way.

457
00:25:13,006 --> 00:25:14,006
Ma'am.

458
00:25:15,306 --> 00:25:16,606
Congratulations.

459
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:43,011
Tell me a story, Abby.

460
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:50,406
Tell me a story so I can sleep.

461
00:26:00,906 --> 00:26:03,106
"Once upon a time there was once...

462
00:26:03,606 --> 00:26:05,593
"a lad who went
to look for a place...

463
00:26:06,906 --> 00:26:08,806
"and he went along, he met a man

464
00:26:09,106 --> 00:26:10,951
"who asked him where he was going.

465
00:26:12,886 --> 00:26:15,071
"He told him his errand and
the stranger said that he..."

466
00:26:15,447 --> 00:26:17,247
You're not doing it right!

467
00:26:18,723 --> 00:26:20,368
You're supposed to do the voices.

468
00:26:20,493 --> 00:26:23,081
Just tell me what
you want and I'll do it!

469
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:24,164
I want Abby!

470
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:27,627
I'll be Abby! I'll be
whoever you want!

471
00:26:55,606 --> 00:26:57,281
So you went ahead and arrested him.

472
00:26:57,806 --> 00:26:59,783
He was trying to cross
the border into Vancouver.

473
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:02,535
- Are you gonna charge him?
- I will if he confesses.

474
00:27:03,106 --> 00:27:05,404
Failing that, we'll hold him
so he can't skip town

475
00:27:05,529 --> 00:27:07,481
while we're waiting for
his DNA results.

476
00:27:07,606 --> 00:27:09,681
I'll let the lab know
a priority sample's coming.

477
00:27:12,206 --> 00:27:14,555
Well, what did he get
off of the wig, detective?

478
00:27:14,781 --> 00:27:17,342
Enough to know that
that's one sick puppy in there.

479
00:27:18,506 --> 00:27:21,206
Why don't you tell me about that?

480
00:27:22,806 --> 00:27:25,206
- Looks like a wig.
- That is a magic wig.

481
00:27:25,806 --> 00:27:27,806
It changes the identity of the dead.

482
00:27:28,387 --> 00:27:29,387
What?

483
00:27:29,512 --> 00:27:31,424
Well, I thought that's why

484
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:33,822
you were putting it on
the bodies at the morgue.

485
00:27:34,741 --> 00:27:36,653
It makes the fantasy more real.

486
00:27:42,753 --> 00:27:44,536
Who were you trying
to turn them into?

487
00:27:46,806 --> 00:27:49,874
<i>I have worked some sick cases...</i>

488
00:27:50,906 --> 00:27:52,754
<i>Rapists, pederasts...</i>

489
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:55,239
I hope you're not
grouping me with those people.

490
00:27:55,706 --> 00:27:57,842
You may be the sickest of them all.

491
00:27:58,195 --> 00:27:59,806
Well, sick or no,

492
00:28:00,606 --> 00:28:02,512
many would argue
it's a victimless crime.

493
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,807
What's victimless
about Lynette Hagen?

494
00:28:06,206 --> 00:28:07,206
Who?

495
00:28:08,043 --> 00:28:10,781
- Or Melissa St. Claire.
- I don't know these women, OK?

496
00:28:10,906 --> 00:28:13,306
- You have the wrong...
- The wrong necrophile?

497
00:28:13,578 --> 00:28:14,578
What?

498
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:17,806
You think I'm the only guy in town
who likes to crack open a cold one?

499
00:28:20,122 --> 00:28:22,283
Where's Brooke Lombardini?

500
00:28:22,646 --> 00:28:24,576
<i>I don't know who that is.</i>

501
00:28:25,106 --> 00:28:27,401
I don't kill people.

502
00:28:32,706 --> 00:28:34,681
These profilers say our killer

503
00:28:34,806 --> 00:28:37,506
is trying to turn these
girls into a loved one.

504
00:28:38,106 --> 00:28:39,322
Like a wife

505
00:28:40,124 --> 00:28:41,124
or a mom.

506
00:28:42,506 --> 00:28:43,387
Is your

507
00:28:43,761 --> 00:28:45,281
mother a blonde, Ivan?

508
00:28:45,406 --> 00:28:46,681
That's disgusting.

509
00:28:46,806 --> 00:28:48,767
The wig isn't even
the important part.

510
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:53,105
For me it's... It's the shoes.

511
00:28:54,115 --> 00:28:55,606
<i>So you put shoes on them, too.</i>

512
00:28:56,212 --> 00:28:57,808
<i>They're a very special pair.</i>

513
00:28:58,683 --> 00:28:59,944
<i>What's special about them?</i>

514
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:02,956
The woman walked in them.

515
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:04,616
Sunny Raines.

516
00:29:05,006 --> 00:29:06,243
The weather girl?

517
00:29:06,946 --> 00:29:10,413
She was a local celebrity killed
in a car accident a couple of years ago.

518
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,980
<i>A friend of mine was working
when she came in on a slab.</i>

519
00:29:13,105 --> 00:29:14,250
<i>He knew I was a fan.</i>

520
00:29:16,806 --> 00:29:18,306
He stole her shoes for you.

521
00:29:19,329 --> 00:29:21,906
The wig, it just completed
the look, but the shoes...

522
00:29:23,906 --> 00:29:25,206
Genuine article.

523
00:29:26,697 --> 00:29:28,481
That's what makes it real.

524
00:29:28,606 --> 00:29:29,706
Genuine article.

525
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:36,206
I took a report of a grave robbery.

526
00:29:36,331 --> 00:29:38,184
I thought you said
it was just a simple theft.

527
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:41,160
Yeah, but listen to what was taken.
A dress, a pair of diamond earrings,

528
00:29:41,285 --> 00:29:42,779
and a pair of pearl earrings.

529
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:43,781
2 pair.

530
00:29:43,906 --> 00:29:45,281
If our unsub is like Bakunas,

531
00:29:45,406 --> 00:29:49,381
then he needs the genuine articles
to complete the fantasy.

532
00:29:49,506 --> 00:29:51,481
Exactly. This grave
could belong to that woman.

533
00:29:52,271 --> 00:29:53,274
Let's see.

534
00:29:53,706 --> 00:29:55,010
Abigail Hansen.

535
00:29:56,067 --> 00:29:57,877
<i>OK, so I got her obit
from the Olympian.</i>

536
00:29:58,119 --> 00:30:00,923
Abigail Reina Hansen
died suddenly at 26

537
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:03,007
from myocarditis, a heart defect.

538
00:30:03,487 --> 00:30:05,164
Sending her passport photo now.

539
00:30:06,829 --> 00:30:08,721
Well, she certainly looks the part.

540
00:30:09,675 --> 00:30:11,381
What else can you tell us about her?

541
00:30:11,506 --> 00:30:14,186
I can tell you that
she was born in Amsterdam,

542
00:30:14,456 --> 00:30:16,681
she never married,
and her employment records

543
00:30:16,806 --> 00:30:20,443
show her working for Patrick and Leona
Gless from 1985 to her death in 1992.

544
00:30:20,611 --> 00:30:22,181
<i>Can you get us an address?</i>

545
00:30:22,405 --> 00:30:25,124
They might be the only ones
who can tell us who Abigail was.

546
00:30:25,606 --> 00:30:27,181
"This is the most beautiful place

547
00:30:27,306 --> 00:30:29,908
"I could ever hope to live,
said the troll's daughter.

548
00:30:30,205 --> 00:30:32,162
"The youth and his sweetheart
entered the castle,

549
00:30:32,287 --> 00:30:34,581
"which was now theirs,
and held their wedding.

550
00:30:34,706 --> 00:30:37,381
"Now all the kings roundabout
who had been in the troll's debt

551
00:30:37,506 --> 00:30:39,369
"and were now out of
it came to the wedding

552
00:30:39,494 --> 00:30:41,710
"and salutate the youth
of their emperor.

553
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:43,806
"Long live the king!

554
00:30:44,506 --> 00:30:47,129
"And he ruled over them all,
and kept peace between them

555
00:30:47,254 --> 00:30:49,381
"and lived in his castle
with his beautiful empress

556
00:30:49,506 --> 00:30:51,957
happily ever after.
The end."

557
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:14,497
<i>And as soon as she accepts her new role,
her fate is sealed.</i>

558
00:31:20,706 --> 00:31:23,506
Did Garcia say what Mr. Gless
does for a living?

559
00:31:24,321 --> 00:31:25,506
Failed artist.

560
00:31:26,506 --> 00:31:28,406
Guess that's what
they call failing up.

561
00:31:29,241 --> 00:31:30,470
Or marrying well.

562
00:31:33,006 --> 00:31:35,506
I think about Abigail
from time to time.

563
00:31:36,318 --> 00:31:38,068
She was such a nice girl.

564
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:41,606
- She was like one of the family.
- Was that why you paid for the funeral?

565
00:31:41,906 --> 00:31:43,506
She didn't have anyone else.

566
00:31:43,806 --> 00:31:46,153
- She was from Denmark.
- Holland, dear.

567
00:31:46,882 --> 00:31:49,949
- What kind of work did she do for you?
- She was the au pair.

568
00:31:50,118 --> 00:31:52,981
- And there was cooking and cleaning.
- She took care of the children?

569
00:31:53,106 --> 00:31:54,869
Just the one... Our son Roderick.

570
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:55,840
Here.

571
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,836
This is the two of them together.

572
00:32:11,865 --> 00:32:13,306
They were close.

573
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,182
She basically raised the boy.

574
00:32:15,414 --> 00:32:17,506
Well, I wouldn't go quite that far.

575
00:32:17,706 --> 00:32:19,227
No? What would you call it?

576
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,206
Patrick likes to think
he was a good father.

577
00:32:25,706 --> 00:32:26,526
So...

578
00:32:27,806 --> 00:32:30,114
Why do you want to know
about Abigail?

579
00:32:31,677 --> 00:32:34,867
We believe that there may be
a connection to some recent murders.

580
00:32:35,209 --> 00:32:36,327
Someone she knew.

581
00:32:37,307 --> 00:32:39,806
How old was your son
when Abigail died?

582
00:32:40,606 --> 00:32:41,506
9.

583
00:32:44,206 --> 00:32:46,379
We weren't here when it happened.

584
00:32:46,815 --> 00:32:48,306
We were on a cruise.

585
00:32:48,906 --> 00:32:50,466
But Roderick was here with Abigail?

586
00:32:51,106 --> 00:32:53,533
When we returned,
we knew something was wrong.

587
00:32:54,106 --> 00:32:55,106
The smell.

588
00:32:56,506 --> 00:32:58,206
They were in his room on the floor.

589
00:32:58,606 --> 00:32:59,606
He was...

590
00:33:00,506 --> 00:33:03,147
curled up next to her,
with her arms around him.

591
00:33:04,206 --> 00:33:05,906
<i>It's how he got to sleep.</i>

592
00:33:06,932 --> 00:33:08,581
How long had she been dead?

593
00:33:08,706 --> 00:33:10,906
The coroner said 2, maybe 3 days.

594
00:33:11,348 --> 00:33:13,285
I didn't have the stomach
for the details.

595
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:15,081
We'd like to speak to Roderick.

596
00:33:15,206 --> 00:33:17,826
Well, if I knew where he was
I'd be happy to tell you.

597
00:33:17,951 --> 00:33:19,881
But we haven't spoken for years.

598
00:33:20,006 --> 00:33:21,373
When he turned 21,

599
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,481
he dropped out of medical school,

600
00:33:23,606 --> 00:33:25,543
liquidated his trust fund.

601
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:28,297
We knew he was troubled.

602
00:33:28,782 --> 00:33:30,848
But I had no idea
he would ever hurt someone.

603
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:33,343
They don't know for sure
that he's...

604
00:33:36,506 --> 00:33:38,806
You don't know for sure.

605
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:43,061
- When was your last communication?
- We got a letter about a year ago.

606
00:33:51,706 --> 00:33:53,916
- Can we borrow this?
- You can have it.

607
00:33:54,823 --> 00:33:56,181
And while you're at it,

608
00:33:56,306 --> 00:33:57,470
take this, too.

609
00:34:01,203 --> 00:34:03,981
It's exactly how they said. Roderick's
trust was emptied in march of'04.

610
00:34:04,106 --> 00:34:06,081
- Half a million bucks.
- Where is he now?

611
00:34:06,206 --> 00:34:08,681
Sir, the thing is, he's
gotta be using straight cash,

612
00:34:08,806 --> 00:34:11,181
'cause there's no paper trail
on him for the last 4 years.

613
00:34:11,306 --> 00:34:14,706
<i>Nothing from the i.r.s., from the DMV.
There's no property or utilities.</i>

614
00:34:14,993 --> 00:34:17,243
- You can't find him?
- I'm sorry.

615
00:34:17,924 --> 00:34:19,847
A half a million
isn't what it used to be.

616
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:24,212
And the way he's accustomed to living,
he would need to supplement his income.

617
00:34:25,206 --> 00:34:27,106
Anything between the lines, Reid?

618
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,481
Nothing that points
to a specific location.

619
00:34:29,606 --> 00:34:31,448
He's basically saying he's happy.

620
00:34:31,573 --> 00:34:33,986
That should be enough for her.
It's essentially a goodbye letter.

621
00:34:34,306 --> 00:34:35,556
Enough for her?

622
00:34:36,938 --> 00:34:38,324
It's only addressed to Leona.

623
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:40,703
- Why not his dad?
- Maybe they didn't get along.

624
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:42,406
No, that's not right.

625
00:34:44,206 --> 00:34:46,506
Garcia, I need you
to check something else.

626
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:49,502
So basically we got nothing.

627
00:35:20,606 --> 00:35:21,606
I missed you.

628
00:35:25,306 --> 00:35:26,306
Me, too.

629
00:35:38,286 --> 00:35:39,286
Drink.

630
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:45,391
It's the last time.

631
00:35:46,806 --> 00:35:47,806
Promise?

632
00:35:49,906 --> 00:35:50,906
Promise.

633
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:58,430
The whole thing.

634
00:36:12,306 --> 00:36:14,311
It's a surprise.

635
00:36:29,727 --> 00:36:31,187
What is this place?

636
00:36:31,692 --> 00:36:32,842
It's forever.

637
00:37:15,531 --> 00:37:16,378
Water.

638
00:37:16,503 --> 00:37:18,381
That's what he said.
Roderick is near water.

639
00:37:18,506 --> 00:37:19,861
It's not very specific.

640
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,581
The earth is two-thirds water.

641
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:23,681
He specified a rocky
shoreline you could see.

642
00:37:23,806 --> 00:37:26,681
JJ, this man is not exactly a
reliable source of information.

643
00:37:26,806 --> 00:37:29,006
OK. This photo
from the Gless house...

644
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:32,406
It was taken at their house
on Mercer island.

645
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,981
- Waterfront property.
- No one's lived there for 10 years.

646
00:37:36,172 --> 00:37:37,506
It's abandoned.
I checked.

647
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:39,681
This could be where
he's holding Brooke.

648
00:37:39,806 --> 00:37:41,854
- He's sending him money.
- What's that?

649
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:45,761
Roderick's dad. It's the reason Roderick
never said goodbye to him in the letter.

650
00:37:46,038 --> 00:37:47,565
They never lost contact.

651
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:50,099
That supplemental income
you were asking about?

652
00:37:50,337 --> 00:37:51,851
This is it.
Every 6 months,

653
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,477
a $50,000 wire.

654
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:56,381
This is Western Union. There's no way
to tell he's on the receiving end.

655
00:37:56,506 --> 00:37:59,806
He's sending it to Roderick.
If you'd seen his father, you'd know.

656
00:37:59,931 --> 00:38:02,403
It's true. Deep down,
he was very guilty about neglecting him.

657
00:38:02,706 --> 00:38:05,681
He's submissive in the marriage.
He's probably doing it behind her back.

658
00:38:05,806 --> 00:38:08,367
- You don't think his dad knew?
- No. No, I think he's a sad man

659
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,208
trying to buy his kid's love.

660
00:38:11,006 --> 00:38:13,205
This is where Brooke's
911 call originad.

661
00:38:13,606 --> 00:38:15,806
This Western Union
is within the circle.

662
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:17,906
Mercer island isn't.

663
00:38:24,306 --> 00:38:25,856
We've got a location.

664
00:40:02,955 --> 00:40:04,748
- Is she alive?
- Paramedics!

665
00:40:06,802 --> 00:40:08,195
He uses a barbiturate.

666
00:40:10,317 --> 00:40:11,866
Start 2 large-bore i.v.s.

667
00:40:12,445 --> 00:40:13,701
Narcan, 2 milligrams.

668
00:40:37,604 --> 00:40:39,506
Some psychic this guy is.

669
00:40:40,006 --> 00:40:43,406
This place is as far from
a rocky shoreline as you can get.

670
00:40:56,933 --> 00:40:58,412
<i>"For those who believe,</i>

671
00:40:58,946 --> 00:41:00,706
<i>"no proof is necessary.</i>

672
00:41:01,406 --> 00:41:03,042
<i>"For those who don't believe,</i>

673
00:41:03,967 --> 00:41:05,606
<i>"no proof is possible."</i>

674
00:41:06,342 --> 00:41:07,486
<i>Stuart Chase.</i>

675
00:41:10,106 --> 00:41:11,906
- Easy, now.
- Honey.

676
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:20,043
She's gonna be OK.

677
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:44,950
You're in early.

678
00:41:47,052 --> 00:41:48,302
Couldn't sleep.

679
00:41:50,442 --> 00:41:52,174
I know how it can be

680
00:41:52,441 --> 00:41:53,718
coming back here.

681
00:41:54,418 --> 00:41:55,970
The bad things seem worse.

682
00:41:56,246 --> 00:41:58,262
You want easy answers.

683
00:41:58,387 --> 00:42:00,947
If you're gonna tell me not to believe
in psychics, you don't have to.

684
00:42:01,072 --> 00:42:03,811
You can believe in what you want.
But when you're here,

685
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:06,216
you need to have faith
in what we do.

686
00:42:06,506 --> 00:42:07,506
It works.

687
00:42:09,206 --> 00:42:10,206
I just...

688
00:42:10,738 --> 00:42:13,606
I saw a mother
losing her child, and...

689
00:42:14,859 --> 00:42:17,366
We didn't have any other leads.
I thought, what harm could it do?

690
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,118
I asked the same question once.

691
00:42:19,606 --> 00:42:20,581
You did?

692
00:42:20,706 --> 00:42:23,106
It was a kidnapping case in Georgia.

693
00:42:23,231 --> 00:42:25,416
We had nothing,
time was running out,

694
00:42:25,806 --> 00:42:27,481
and there was a local woman

695
00:42:27,606 --> 00:42:28,906
known for her...

696
00:42:29,364 --> 00:42:30,254
abilities.

697
00:42:31,538 --> 00:42:32,781
On her advice,

698
00:42:32,906 --> 00:42:34,258
we took the investigation

699
00:42:34,736 --> 00:42:36,106
in the wrong direction.

700
00:42:38,136 --> 00:42:39,138
The boy died.

701
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:42,039
I'm sorry.

702
00:42:43,006 --> 00:42:44,506
It was a long time ago.

703
00:42:47,986 --> 00:42:49,398
Well, we won this time.

704
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,679
That's what matters, right?

705
00:42:54,032 --> 00:42:55,218
Welcome back.
