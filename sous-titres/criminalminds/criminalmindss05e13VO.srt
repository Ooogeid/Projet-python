1
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:36,163
Ok. I'll see what I can do.

2
00:02:36,797 --> 00:02:37,861
Thanks.

3
00:03:16,928 --> 00:03:20,231
I'm not sure what we have here, but
I just got a call and some case files

4
00:03:20,356 --> 00:03:22,660
from a sheriff samuel
in Uinta county, Wyoming.

5
00:03:23,032 --> 00:03:25,496
6 nights ago, two different
teens were found hanging

6
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,206
- in their bedrooms.
- Hanging?

7
00:03:27,427 --> 00:03:29,456
Trish Leake was dead
when she was found.

8
00:03:29,581 --> 00:03:31,630
Ryan Krouse was revived on scene,

9
00:03:31,755 --> 00:03:33,938
but then died a few days later
in the hospital.

10
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:36,799
I know we don't handle suicides.

11
00:03:37,442 --> 00:03:38,868
But the previous friday,

12
00:03:38,993 --> 00:03:41,528
two more boys a few towns
over were found hanging

13
00:03:41,653 --> 00:03:43,138
on the backs of their doors.

14
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:46,356
4 successful suicides in the
same rural county in a week?

15
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:48,712
That's, uh, way above
the national average.

16
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:51,585
I know.
These kids don't fit the pattern.

17
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:56,221
No drug or alcohol abuse,
no antidepressants, no prior arrests.

18
00:03:56,346 --> 00:03:59,474
These are just plain good kids
who decided to hang themselves

19
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,782
at approximately the same
time on a friday night.

20
00:04:06,238 --> 00:04:07,440
When someone...

21
00:04:07,737 --> 00:04:08,956
feels trapped...

22
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:12,353
in what feels like
a hopeless situation,

23
00:04:12,478 --> 00:04:14,481
pulling the trigger
or swallowing pills

24
00:04:14,606 --> 00:04:16,881
or hanging yourself seems
like the only way out.

25
00:04:17,607 --> 00:04:19,383
None of that seems to exist here.

26
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,490
Something's really wrong.

27
00:04:21,615 --> 00:04:23,178
Hotch, I can feel it.

28
00:04:27,248 --> 00:04:30,144
Look, all these events
happened on a friday.

29
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:32,396
It's wednesday.

30
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,652
We're not on another case right now.

31
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,972
All right. Generate an
equivocal death investigation

32
00:04:43,097 --> 00:04:44,779
and get everybody on the jet.

33
00:04:44,904 --> 00:04:47,542
We will determine whether
these are homicides or suicides.

34
00:04:47,948 --> 00:04:49,705
And even if they are suicides...

35
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:52,070
there's definitely
something wrong here.

"Life is a game. Play it.

39
00:05:46,928 --> 00:05:49,913
Life is too precious.
Do not destroy it."

<i>Mother Teresa.</i>

41
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:54,516
Sir, it's not that I'm not glad
to be coming with you, because I am.

42
00:05:54,641 --> 00:05:56,271
I just don't understand the why.

43
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,795
One of the aspects of an equivocal
death investigation when suicide

44
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,277
is a probability is an indirect
personality assessment.

45
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,613
Our victims are all
internet generation kids.

46
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,475
There should be invaluable
personal data on their computers

47
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,076
to mine for the evaluation.

48
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:12,413
If they committed suicide, evidence of
it will probably in their cyber world.

49
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:15,003
So I'm gonna snoop through
dead kids' computers?

50
00:06:15,128 --> 00:06:17,292
This plane seldom
makes pleasure trips.

51
00:06:18,316 --> 00:06:20,921
We've all been over the files.
Let's talk about victimology.

52
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:25,599
Ok. All 4 kids were decent students,
from different neighboring towns

53
00:06:25,724 --> 00:06:27,803
dut the same school
and the same county.

54
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,660
Active in sports and community.

55
00:06:29,785 --> 00:06:33,235
Intact families, no mental disorders,
no precipitating events.

56
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,249
These are just average good kids.
There has to be some underlying issue.

57
00:06:36,374 --> 00:06:40,315
Besides relative proximity there's no
obvious connection between any of them.

58
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,359
It seems to rule out
an overt suicide pact.

59
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,817
The first few days leading
up to a teenager's suicide

60
00:06:44,942 --> 00:06:48,028
are usually very telling.
Their behavior is transparent.

61
00:06:48,153 --> 00:06:49,805
There's a multitude of indicators.

62
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,910
Yeah, but the most
common don't exist here.

63
00:06:52,422 --> 00:06:53,996
There's no prior attempts,

64
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:57,708
No period of deep depression,
no withdrawal from family members,

65
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:00,261
No spontaneous
proclamations of love.

66
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:02,868
Spontaneous proclamations of love?

67
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,516
Sometimes a suicidal person,
in the days leading up to the act,

68
00:07:09,641 --> 00:07:12,346
will just blurt out
"I love you" to family,

69
00:07:12,471 --> 00:07:14,516
Sort of like a goodbye.

70
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,391
We'll start
with the latest two victims.

71
00:07:23,635 --> 00:07:26,528
If they were suicides, let's find
out what drove them to it.

72
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,003
Hello.

73
00:07:43,934 --> 00:07:44,922
Rhonda Samuel.

74
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,966
Hi. Agent Jareau.
We spoke on the phone.

75
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:50,076
Thanks for coming out.
My county's getting pretty shook up.

76
00:07:50,274 --> 00:07:52,052
I got this reporter
won't stop calling.

77
00:07:52,177 --> 00:07:55,403
I'm holding him off, but he's connecting
the dots on the number of suicides.

78
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,621
- Should I call him back?
- No, not just yet.

79
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:02,523
We need to be very careful about
when we release this information.

80
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:05,567
Sensationalizing these deaths may
cause a domino effect with other kids.

81
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,992
The term is suicide contagion.
The spread of suicidal thoughts among

82
00:08:09,117 --> 00:08:11,907
a group of people that
sometimes results in copycat acts.

83
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,935
It's especially prevalent in teen cases,
and studies suggest that media coverage

84
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,021
is sometimes associated
with more deaths.

85
00:08:17,146 --> 00:08:18,872
Is there a good place
for me to set up?

86
00:08:19,118 --> 00:08:20,828
Don't have much of a command center.

87
00:08:20,953 --> 00:08:22,600
Fret not.
I got my own command center.

88
00:08:22,725 --> 00:08:24,586
- I just need your juice.
- You got it.

89
00:08:38,483 --> 00:08:39,560
Hello, sir.

90
00:08:39,834 --> 00:08:41,941
We're with the FBI
behavioral analysis unit.

91
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:46,567
She was so excited about
graduating high school next year.

92
00:08:47,284 --> 00:08:49,403
She couldn't wait for her sats.

93
00:08:50,141 --> 00:08:52,306
- Was trish dating anybody?
- No.

94
00:08:52,827 --> 00:08:54,015
Billy Sullivan.

95
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,884
- It that who she's...
- Yes.

96
00:09:01,621 --> 00:09:02,875
What is it, Mr. Leake?

97
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:07,177
She ran up over $100 texting
last month. And, we, um,

98
00:09:07,406 --> 00:09:09,464
we grounded her
and we took away her cell.

99
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:10,784
Not we.

100
00:09:11,206 --> 00:09:12,187
Me.

101
00:09:13,184 --> 00:09:14,125
I did that.

102
00:09:16,109 --> 00:09:18,038
Why didn't you tell me
she had a boyfriend?

103
00:09:18,163 --> 00:09:19,790
Because you would have freaked out.

104
00:09:19,915 --> 00:09:22,088
- No, I wouldn't.
- You are right now.

105
00:09:22,213 --> 00:09:24,899
Not because she had a boyfriend,
because I may have caused...

106
00:09:25,024 --> 00:09:27,416
Mr. Leake, if your daughter
committed suicide,

107
00:09:28,217 --> 00:09:30,360
it wouldn't have been
because of some punishment.

108
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,765
It's so much more
complicated than that.

109
00:09:33,937 --> 00:09:34,948
If?

110
00:09:36,741 --> 00:09:37,795
Excuse me?

111
00:09:40,134 --> 00:09:42,247
You said "if" she committed suicide.

112
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,862
Would you mind
showing us Trish's room?

113
00:09:51,818 --> 00:09:54,092
Yeah. Sure.
It's this way.

114
00:10:00,611 --> 00:10:02,689
I knew he didn't kill himself.

115
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,103
He wouldn't do that to us.

116
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:10,108
I'm sorry?

117
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,755
That's, uh, that's why you're here.

118
00:10:14,324 --> 00:10:16,573
The FBI wouldn't be investigating

119
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,084
a suicide, right?

120
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,820
That's not exactly true.

121
00:10:20,945 --> 00:10:23,861
Sometimes we do what's called
an equivocal death investigation

122
00:10:23,986 --> 00:10:25,874
to try to figure out
the manner of death.

123
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,333
It may turn out that...

124
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:30,379
Our investigation will try
and sort it all out for you.

125
00:10:35,772 --> 00:10:36,781
I'm sorry.

126
00:10:44,785 --> 00:10:46,641
She certainly was accomplished.

127
00:10:46,925 --> 00:10:49,733
There's nothing unusual
in her diary...

128
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:51,617
No fury, no angst.

129
00:10:51,742 --> 00:10:54,569
Do you really have to go
through all her personal stuff?

130
00:10:55,145 --> 00:10:56,906
She was such a private girl.

131
00:10:59,795 --> 00:11:03,120
We are terribly sorry
to have to do this.

132
00:11:03,984 --> 00:11:05,605
We care about Trish, and we want

133
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:08,340
to make sure this doesn't
happen to anybody else's daughter.

134
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,302
Mr. And Mrs. Leake, there's a
form I need you both to fill out.

135
00:11:11,427 --> 00:11:12,629
Can you come with me?

136
00:11:14,945 --> 00:11:16,304
If you need anything...

137
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:17,829
Thank you.

138
00:11:21,442 --> 00:11:23,193
Those poor people.

139
00:11:23,318 --> 00:11:25,624
I just hope we haven't
made it worse for them.

140
00:11:26,341 --> 00:11:27,352
Could we?

141
00:11:29,516 --> 00:11:31,940
Are you sure I can't get
anyone something to drink?

142
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,567
Yes, ma'am, thank you.

143
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:36,521
Well, if you change your mind...

144
00:11:38,429 --> 00:11:40,325
Do you think someone killed her?

145
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,975
- Ma'am...
- Sharon...

146
00:11:42,191 --> 00:11:43,433
Why would you say

147
00:11:43,558 --> 00:11:45,412
"if" she committed suicide?

148
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:50,375
- Ma'am, I...
- I mean, why would she say that

149
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:52,927
if she didn't think...
if she thought...

150
00:11:55,467 --> 00:11:57,299
why would you say that?

151
00:12:05,915 --> 00:12:09,260
Well, personal touches show
she was comfortable here.

152
00:12:10,633 --> 00:12:13,148
Sat prep books, college brochures.

153
00:12:13,367 --> 00:12:15,559
She's a low suicide risk
if I ever saw one.

154
00:12:15,684 --> 00:12:18,721
Yeah, I think it's pretty obvious
Trish had everything to live for.

155
00:12:18,846 --> 00:12:21,821
Maybe garcia will find something on
the laptop that we're not seeing here.

156
00:12:21,946 --> 00:12:22,959
Ok.

157
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,507
There's no secret hiding places.

158
00:12:30,236 --> 00:12:31,780
Or drug paraphernalia.

159
00:12:33,748 --> 00:12:35,337
Is this Ryan's girlfriend?

160
00:12:36,593 --> 00:12:37,931
Yeah. Shaunna.

161
00:12:39,001 --> 00:12:40,790
They seemed really good together.

162
00:12:41,415 --> 00:12:43,276
Did he ever date Trish Leake?

163
00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:45,840
I never heard
of Trish Leake until...

164
00:12:47,699 --> 00:12:50,701
when we met her parents
at the hospital, uh, friday.

165
00:12:51,424 --> 00:12:53,339
Seems like he got
pretty good grades.

166
00:12:54,646 --> 00:12:56,646
And this letter
from the football coach?

167
00:12:59,516 --> 00:13:01,341
Coach Barswell wanted him to...

168
00:13:02,217 --> 00:13:03,914
be in varsity next year.

169
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:05,715
Quarterback.

170
00:13:10,018 --> 00:13:11,652
Where is ryan's computer?

171
00:13:13,968 --> 00:13:16,297
We have--we have
one in the family room.

172
00:13:16,738 --> 00:13:18,076
He didn't have his own?

173
00:13:20,013 --> 00:13:21,936
We were worried about,

174
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,320
unsupervised online time,

175
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,319
So we wanted him in the
middle of everyone.

176
00:13:26,346 --> 00:13:28,043
I can--I can go show you.

177
00:13:28,163 --> 00:13:29,630
Actually, if you just get us the

178
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,832
network ip address,
I believe our technical analyst

179
00:13:31,952 --> 00:13:33,900
Can go over it off site.

180
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,068
If it helps prove that
ryan didn't kill himself,

181
00:13:36,188 --> 00:13:38,172
you can have anything you need.

182
00:13:40,867 --> 00:13:43,534
Hey, you ready to delve into
trish leake's online world?

183
00:13:43,654 --> 00:13:46,343
If by ready you mean extremely
capable and even more reluctant.

184
00:13:46,846 --> 00:13:47,977
Something like that.

185
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:50,052
How are the leakes holding out?

186
00:13:50,172 --> 00:13:51,904
probably as well
as can be expected.

187
00:13:52,709 --> 00:13:54,532
- They're strong people.
- Good.

188
00:13:54,646 --> 00:13:55,812
Well, that's weird.

189
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,732
What?

190
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:58,197
There's nothing here.

191
00:13:58,317 --> 00:13:59,311
Nothing useful?

192
00:13:59,344 --> 00:14:00,575
Nothing at all.

193
00:14:00,695 --> 00:14:03,087
Look, there's no root directory,
there's no operating system.

194
00:14:03,207 --> 00:14:05,054
The registry appears to be blank.

195
00:14:05,174 --> 00:14:07,246
But why would she have
an empty computer set up?

196
00:14:07,366 --> 00:14:09,726
I did not say empty,
I said appears to be blank.

197
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:12,019
- Meaning?
- I'm gonna need a little while.

198
00:14:16,317 --> 00:14:19,558
I know. I know.
I never should have said "if."

199
00:14:21,008 --> 00:14:22,653
Believe me,
the last thing I want

200
00:14:22,773 --> 00:14:24,844
is to make things worse
for these families.

201
00:14:28,359 --> 00:14:31,417
Look, I'm not invested in
these not being suicides.

202
00:14:31,683 --> 00:14:32,735
I just...

203
00:14:33,176 --> 00:14:35,735
want to try and keep this
Friday from being like the last two.

204
00:14:36,605 --> 00:14:37,513
I got it!

205
00:14:38,005 --> 00:14:39,978
It was--it was just a
basic trojan horse.

206
00:14:40,098 --> 00:14:42,519
It just hid the directories,
didn't erase them.

207
00:14:43,741 --> 00:14:44,638
What is it?

208
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:47,365
She was on a choking game
site the night she died.

209
00:14:47,752 --> 00:14:48,546
A what?

210
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:51,755
It's a game kids play where they choke
themselves to get a buzz, to get high.

211
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,075
They call it the good kids' high.
You get lightheaded

212
00:14:54,195 --> 00:14:57,151
and a sense of euphoria even though
no actual drugs are involved.

213
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,046
It's something kids in high school play.

214
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:00,396
Did ryan have a computer?

215
00:15:00,516 --> 00:15:01,542
Not in his room.

216
00:15:01,598 --> 00:15:03,476
- What about a gaming system?
- Yeah, he did.

217
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,275
Teenagers will find a way to get online.

218
00:15:05,395 --> 00:15:07,514
I have the, uh, ip address.

219
00:15:08,437 --> 00:15:09,546
That will help.

220
00:15:11,681 --> 00:15:14,406
Bingo. Ryan was on the same
site on the same night.

221
00:15:14,737 --> 00:15:16,107
It wasn't suicide.

222
00:15:19,697 --> 00:15:22,237
Hang on, this is a text to voice icon.
Let's see what happens.

223
00:15:22,357 --> 00:15:23,791
Come on, try it.

224
00:15:24,106 --> 00:15:25,607
We all do it. I dare you.

225
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:29,229
I dare you?
Someone was orchestrating this,

226
00:15:29,349 --> 00:15:31,680
purposely getting the
kids to choke themselves.

227
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,420
Make sure you close the door.

228
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,396
Tomorrow's the big night.

229
00:16:06,058 --> 00:16:07,680
We're all gonna play the game.

230
00:16:12,782 --> 00:16:14,574
There's a whole subculture
around this game.

231
00:16:14,575 --> 00:16:16,614
They make up names for it,
they do it at parties.

232
00:16:16,734 --> 00:16:19,197
But someone is daring
these kids in this area

233
00:16:19,317 --> 00:16:20,671
to play the game.

234
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:25,260
It's a contest.
And there are rules.

235
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,367
Come on, evans high,
this is the big one.

236
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:30,819
Garfield edged out
casper high last week.

237
00:16:30,939 --> 00:16:32,475
You gonna let them diss us?

238
00:16:32,595 --> 00:16:33,947
Diss--sounds like a kid.

239
00:16:34,067 --> 00:16:36,037
Who else would pit schools
against each other?

240
00:16:36,157 --> 00:16:37,997
Reckless teenage competition.

241
00:16:38,313 --> 00:16:41,283
The school that logs the most
high time this Friday wins.

242
00:16:41,546 --> 00:16:42,989
Friday, tomorrow.

243
00:16:43,109 --> 00:16:44,619
Get your friends on board.

244
00:16:44,739 --> 00:16:47,130
Practice makes the high last longer.

245
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,929
Gotta do it alone and
video it with your webcam

246
00:16:50,049 --> 00:16:52,323
and upload it to the
site for it to count.

247
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,266
Doing it alone requires ligatures.

248
00:16:54,308 --> 00:16:56,853
He's basically encouraging them to
play the deadliest form of the game

249
00:16:56,872 --> 00:16:58,327
with no one there to revive them.

250
00:16:58,356 --> 00:16:59,717
Garcia, shut the site down.

251
00:16:59,745 --> 00:17:02,127
Sir, I can totally do that,
But I don't think you want me to.

252
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:02,793
Why?

253
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:05,046
Right now this site is our
only way to track the unsub,

254
00:17:05,103 --> 00:17:07,497
and if I cut into it, he will
certainly know we're watching him,

255
00:17:07,535 --> 00:17:10,214
in which case he'll shut it down and
he'll write a simple change in code,

256
00:17:10,252 --> 00:17:11,980
bring it back up in a more covert fashion.

257
00:17:12,036 --> 00:17:14,947
Plus there's no telling how many
servers it's replicated on, anyway.

258
00:17:15,021 --> 00:17:16,060
You're right.

259
00:17:16,612 --> 00:17:18,044
We're ready to give the profile.

260
00:17:19,015 --> 00:17:20,986
We believe the unsub
responsible for these deaths

261
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:22,155
may be a teenager.

262
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:24,424
He's a loner. He doesn't
participate in team sports

263
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:27,901
or group activities.
He's withdrawn, very low self-esteem.

264
00:17:28,021 --> 00:17:30,396
His only form of pure
interaction is online.

265
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:32,987
He engages in activity that
draws attention to himself

266
00:17:33,107 --> 00:17:35,066
yet isolates him from his peers.

267
00:17:35,186 --> 00:17:38,690
Parents and teachers should watch
out for the warning signs--

268
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:41,649
Kids with bloodshot eyes,
Marks on their necks,

269
00:17:41,925 --> 00:17:44,306
severe headaches, disorientation.

270
00:17:44,426 --> 00:17:46,420
In real life, he considers
himself a loser.

271
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:49,411
In cyberspace, he can pull strings.
Makes him feel powerful.

272
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:52,058
Does this kid know that other
kids are dying because of him?

273
00:17:52,178 --> 00:17:54,114
He's choking himself and
daring others to do it,

274
00:17:54,234 --> 00:17:56,805
so we're most likely looking
at reckless homicides here.

275
00:17:57,084 --> 00:17:59,419
It you see anything that's
unusual or suspicious,

276
00:17:59,539 --> 00:18:01,420
just call the sheriff's department

277
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,822
And we will try to direct
you as best we can.

278
00:18:04,178 --> 00:18:05,059
Thank you.

279
00:18:11,814 --> 00:18:13,983
Well, we've told as many
parents as we could.

280
00:18:15,915 --> 00:18:17,280
Do you think it helped?

281
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,424
Not as much as getting
through to the kids will.

282
00:18:24,432 --> 00:18:25,705
Two different mechanisms,

283
00:18:25,825 --> 00:18:28,369
strangulation and hyperventilation,

284
00:18:28,489 --> 00:18:32,169
create the same effec
t- oxygen deprivation in the brain.

285
00:18:34,443 --> 00:18:35,283
Hey, kid.

286
00:18:36,953 --> 00:18:38,636
Not a  good idea.
Let me see it.

287
00:18:42,276 --> 00:18:44,157
"what planet is this dude from?"

288
00:18:45,785 --> 00:18:47,693
"he doesn't want us to win the contest."

289
00:18:49,177 --> 00:18:51,629
I think the more accurate statement

290
00:18:51,749 --> 00:18:55,855
would be, "he doesn't want us to
participate in the contest at all."

291
00:18:55,975 --> 00:18:59,206
This was ryan's desk, right?
This is where ryan sat?

292
00:19:00,047 --> 00:19:01,238
You guys remember ryan.

293
00:19:01,611 --> 00:19:03,306
He played football.

294
00:19:03,426 --> 00:19:05,185
Took--took shaunna to prom.

295
00:19:05,305 --> 00:19:08,824
I'm assuming that some of you were
probably even friends with ryan.

296
00:19:09,437 --> 00:19:11,645
Ryan wanted to win the contest, too,

297
00:19:11,765 --> 00:19:13,905
but the way ryan choked himself,

298
00:19:14,168 --> 00:19:16,496
he cut off all
the oxygen to his brain,

299
00:19:16,616 --> 00:19:19,316
which sent a distress
signal to his heart,

300
00:19:19,556 --> 00:19:20,897
slowing it down.

301
00:19:21,017 --> 00:19:23,682
Then his brain, in an
effort to preserve itself,

302
00:19:23,932 --> 00:19:26,001
shut off all no
n-essential bodily functions.

303
00:19:26,121 --> 00:19:28,506
His arms gave out.
His legs gave out.

304
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:31,539
Which means he couldn't loosen
the tie around his neck,

305
00:19:31,659 --> 00:19:33,574
at which point panic set in,

306
00:19:33,694 --> 00:19:36,410
and in ryan's case,
it escalated to cardiac arrest.

307
00:19:36,747 --> 00:19:38,363
Which means that his heart stopped.

308
00:19:38,483 --> 00:19:41,478
Brain damage began,
and within 4 minutes,

309
00:19:42,425 --> 00:19:45,173
he is completely
and totally brain dead.

310
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:50,655
He died scared and
probably in a lot of pain

311
00:19:50,775 --> 00:19:54,225
And unable to stop what he thought
he had complete control of.

312
00:19:54,345 --> 00:19:57,146
All because he wanted
to participate in

313
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:01,010
What I consider to be a pretty
pretty lame game.

314
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:05,852
So, I mean, your text is
actually completely accurate.

315
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:07,501
I don't want you to win the contest,

316
00:20:07,621 --> 00:20:09,672
Because I don't want
you to play the game.

317
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,796
You all believe this crap?

318
00:20:17,847 --> 00:20:18,701
You don't?

319
00:20:20,436 --> 00:20:22,604
Why don't you come up here
and tell us what you think.

320
00:20:25,365 --> 00:20:26,259
Whatever.

321
00:20:46,051 --> 00:20:47,168
Kid, stop!

322
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,080
You all right?

323
00:20:58,127 --> 00:20:59,423
- Just relax.
- Let me go!

324
00:20:59,489 --> 00:21:01,104
- Then stop fighting.
- Let me go!

325
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,339
Stop fighting. Stop it.

326
00:21:02,459 --> 00:21:03,582
Let me go.

327
00:21:03,702 --> 00:21:05,518
- It's all right.
- You ok?

328
00:21:06,392 --> 00:21:07,877
Yeah. I'm fine.

329
00:21:08,626 --> 00:21:09,957
Why'd you run?

330
00:21:12,716 --> 00:21:14,079
Morgan, look at his neck.

331
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,293
Let me look at your neck.

332
00:21:16,344 --> 00:21:17,433
Don't touch that!

333
00:21:17,448 --> 00:21:18,718
Hey, what'd I say?

334
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:19,568
Relax.

335
00:21:25,137 --> 00:21:27,674
Different colors mean
different stages of healing.

336
00:21:28,686 --> 00:21:31,330
You've been doing this to yourself
for a long time, haven't you?

337
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:35,223
There's no telling how much
his brain has suffered.

338
00:21:38,904 --> 00:21:39,972
Dr. Reid.

339
00:21:40,349 --> 00:21:41,586
You think it's him?

340
00:21:41,706 --> 00:21:43,421
He's a pretty likely candidate.

341
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:45,408
Woman on pa: Dr. Spire to er.

342
00:21:45,528 --> 00:21:46,910
I'm wilson summers.

343
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:49,345
The school called and
said my son was injured.

344
00:21:51,091 --> 00:21:52,189
You know him?

345
00:21:52,309 --> 00:21:54,511
Professionally.
He works for the fire department.

346
00:21:55,497 --> 00:21:56,363
Sheriff.

347
00:21:56,483 --> 00:21:57,978
This is dr. Reid.

348
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,234
Is my son all right, doctor?

349
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:02,434
Actually, I'm not that type of doctor.

350
00:22:02,611 --> 00:22:04,364
I'm with the fbi.

351
00:22:04,921 --> 00:22:05,727
Fbi?

352
00:22:06,093 --> 00:22:08,993
Your son Christopher has
been choking himself.

353
00:22:09,274 --> 00:22:10,472
I don't understand.

354
00:22:10,597 --> 00:22:12,555
You know the kids
that have died recently?

355
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,625
- The suicides.
- They may not be suicides.

356
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:19,003
It's a game that kids his age
tend to play where they force

357
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:22,511
themselves to pass out for the,
the buzz that it gives them.

358
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,300
How long has Christopher

359
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,552
been dressing in the gothic fashion?

360
00:22:26,935 --> 00:22:29,548
- The black nails and the eyes and...
- A while.

361
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,558
He's been having a rough time.

362
00:22:32,829 --> 00:22:33,685
Why's that?

363
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:36,591
His mother died a few years ago, and

364
00:22:37,739 --> 00:22:39,482
he's been wearing black ever since.

365
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,569
Does Christopher spend
a lot of time on the computer?

366
00:22:44,719 --> 00:22:46,547
Just every waking...

367
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,534
Why?

368
00:22:49,922 --> 00:22:51,828
We think your son may have created a

369
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:54,024
website encouraging kids to

370
00:22:54,258 --> 00:22:56,249
compete in this choking contest.

371
00:22:57,926 --> 00:22:59,695
- What are you saying?
- Dad.

372
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:01,805
Hey, buddy.

373
00:23:02,086 --> 00:23:03,131
Take him inside.

374
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,384
Your son needs to go
in for some tests.

375
00:23:07,224 --> 00:23:08,033
Will.

376
00:23:10,407 --> 00:23:13,099
When he's done, we're gonna need
to talk to him down in my office.

377
00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:19,060
There hasn't been any
activity all night.

378
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:21,190
It's not Friday yet.

379
00:23:28,973 --> 00:23:31,598
I appreciate you letting us
take a look at his computer.

380
00:23:32,735 --> 00:23:34,446
You're making a mistake, Rhonda.

381
00:23:35,348 --> 00:23:36,813
Chris is a good kid.

382
00:23:37,879 --> 00:23:39,426
I really hope that's true.

383
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:40,774
Here it is.

384
00:23:42,497 --> 00:23:45,548
Well,If this all works out, I promise I'll
give it back to him as soon as possible.

385
00:23:58,306 --> 00:24:01,330
Christopher, we know you've been going
through a lot since your mother died.

386
00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:05,109
When bad things happen to us, we get
frustrated, kid. Sometimes we act out

387
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,236
and we do things we're not proud of.

388
00:24:07,996 --> 00:24:10,615
- He's not very engaged.
- Give them some time.

389
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,825
Well,It's almost friday.
We don't have any time.

390
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,620
Well as long as he's here, he can't
post anything new to his website.

391
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:17,955
True, but the kids are
still gonna play the game.

392
00:24:19,936 --> 00:24:22,335
- Here's the full background you wanted.
- Thank you.

393
00:24:24,768 --> 00:24:26,209
No wonder he's a loner.

394
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,758
They've moved 3 times
since his mother died.

395
00:24:29,137 --> 00:24:31,594
- Cut off his peer support.
- 3 new schools in

396
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:34,855
2 years. That is a lot of adjustment
for a kid to have to make.

397
00:24:35,171 --> 00:24:37,937
I want you to know that we're going
to be confiscating your computer.

398
00:24:38,062 --> 00:24:41,145
- Our analyst is going through all of it.
- So that we can uncover the truth.

399
00:24:42,257 --> 00:24:43,230
Sure you will.

400
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,757
Truth.

401
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,186
He doesn't seem worried
about us finding anything.

402
00:24:51,311 --> 00:24:53,084
They aren't building any rapport.

403
00:24:54,127 --> 00:24:55,088
They're back.

404
00:24:59,658 --> 00:25:01,715
Mary, this Christopher
kid is fantastical.

405
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,461
He's got a segmented hard drive, serious
firewalls, major league encryption.

406
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:08,108
No reason for all that unless he's
hiding something serious.

407
00:25:08,233 --> 00:25:09,966
OK, so that's why he isn't worried.

408
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:11,217
This is...

409
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:14,790
Unusual. Every attack I launch
is shot down immediately.

410
00:25:16,423 --> 00:25:17,348
What's that?

411
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,767
Somebody just uploaded
a new video to the game site.

412
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:20,843
It's 12:01.

413
00:25:20,968 --> 00:25:22,645
It's Friday. They're playing.

414
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:25,173
It's only a matter of time
before some of them go wrong.

415
00:25:25,298 --> 00:25:26,951
Guys,I'm gonna keep dead-ending on this

416
00:25:27,076 --> 00:25:29,458
until I get a beat on how
he set up his security system.

417
00:25:34,222 --> 00:25:35,652
Hope you got a plan "b."

418
00:25:42,003 --> 00:25:45,331
Garcia, I think that this kid will
relate to you better than anybody else.

419
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:48,190
I want you to talk to him,
see if you can get him to open up.

420
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,245
Sir, I have never done that before.

421
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:53,926
What if I mess up?

422
00:25:54,191 --> 00:25:55,178
You'll be fine.

423
00:26:17,183 --> 00:26:18,871
Hi there. I'm penelope.

424
00:26:20,077 --> 00:26:21,074
Good for you.

425
00:26:22,538 --> 00:26:23,616
Can I sit down?

426
00:26:23,968 --> 00:26:24,999
You're the cop.

427
00:26:29,018 --> 00:26:30,463
I look like a cop to you?

428
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:32,632
Yeah. What, you aren't?

429
00:26:32,933 --> 00:26:33,683
No.

430
00:26:34,433 --> 00:26:35,760
Fbi tech analyst.

431
00:26:36,584 --> 00:26:38,971
I just have some
administrative cyber crud

432
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,432
to go over with you.
Just a geekette.

433
00:26:42,218 --> 00:26:43,038
Cool.

434
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,895
You are glum.

435
00:26:49,123 --> 00:26:50,483
Time is a great healer.

436
00:26:51,948 --> 00:26:53,776
You have no idea how I feel.

437
00:26:55,264 --> 00:26:58,006
I lost my mom and my dad when
I was about your age, though.

438
00:26:59,236 --> 00:27:00,159
I don't know.

439
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:01,953
I think I have a pretty good idea.

440
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:05,831
And I felt totally alone.

441
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:08,751
Till I found netizens.

442
00:27:14,797 --> 00:27:15,735
Btdt.

443
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:19,028
Hey, I'm...

444
00:27:19,989 --> 00:27:21,009
I'm not lying.

445
00:27:21,313 --> 00:27:22,719
It'll totally get better.

446
00:27:25,005 --> 00:27:26,519
Btw, I like your nails.

447
00:27:27,231 --> 00:27:28,098
Thanks.

448
00:27:28,415 --> 00:27:29,438
You into goth?

449
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:32,929
You know, I don't think I'm supposed to
be anymore, But the love is still there.

450
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:36,404
So you're fbi?

451
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:38,948
Yeah, I know.
It's crazy, but I love it.

452
00:27:41,897 --> 00:27:44,241
I enjoy your earring, too.
Where did you score that?

453
00:27:44,464 --> 00:27:47,540
Ebay. It's supposed to be Johnny
d.'s from that pirate movie.

454
00:27:47,854 --> 00:27:48,791
Most awesome.

455
00:27:49,822 --> 00:27:50,865
She's good.

456
00:27:51,259 --> 00:27:54,171
Established rapport when
Morgan and Reid couldn't.

457
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,924
- We should bring her out all the time.
- OK, your whole pgp

458
00:27:57,092 --> 00:28:00,136
disc encryption system
Is like crazy impressive.

459
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:04,557
- Yeah, I'm into that kind of stuff.
- Stuff? Dude, you do not understand.

460
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:07,752
I am jealous. That is state-of-the-art
technology the feeb does not have.

461
00:28:08,924 --> 00:28:09,861
Whatever.

462
00:28:10,553 --> 00:28:13,232
OK. How did you get
your anonymizing service?

463
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,818
I got it from some link
from some dude online.

464
00:28:16,765 --> 00:28:17,945
What do you care?

465
00:28:18,265 --> 00:28:20,197
I just think it's uber cool how

466
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:23,075
you set your whole system up.
Like how you use an e-shredder

467
00:28:23,539 --> 00:28:25,050
To obliterate your net activity

468
00:28:25,175 --> 00:28:28,289
and a window wiper as your secondary
trash eraser. Who does that?

469
00:28:29,345 --> 00:28:30,499
Everybody does that.

470
00:28:32,815 --> 00:28:34,022
The interview's over.

471
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,672
- Interview?
- I was just...

472
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,065
His father invoked.

473
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,069
Dad.

474
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,932
I'm getting you a lawyer.

475
00:28:43,057 --> 00:28:45,820
I screwed up and failed you when
your mother died. Not this time.

476
00:28:46,335 --> 00:28:48,559
Unless you people have
something to charge him with.

477
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:51,020
We're leaving.

478
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:55,858
Syl, miss p.

479
00:28:58,193 --> 00:28:59,189
By the way,

480
00:29:00,619 --> 00:29:01,838
I do miss my mom.

481
00:29:07,034 --> 00:29:08,545
She's not your friend.

482
00:29:09,155 --> 00:29:10,581
She was trying to trick you.

483
00:29:16,452 --> 00:29:17,870
Sir, I'm sorry, I tried.

484
00:29:17,995 --> 00:29:19,452
If he invokes, he invokes.

485
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:21,747
Concentrate on cracking
the encryption.

486
00:29:22,111 --> 00:29:22,954
Yeah.

487
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:36,255
Judging by sheer volume, Christopher's
mother was sick quite a bit.

488
00:29:36,516 --> 00:29:38,943
His father brought her
into the er repeatedly.

489
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:42,147
She's described as being
violently ill each time.

490
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,198
A couple of days in the icu,

491
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:47,118
miraculous recovery,
only to be repeated time and again.

492
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:49,412
No diagnosis, no discernable cause.

493
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:52,623
- There's another video going up.
- That's 4 kids playing in half an hour.

494
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,363
- How many kids go to this school?
- Its catchment is the whole county.

495
00:29:55,436 --> 00:29:56,502
It's almost 2,000.

496
00:29:56,557 --> 00:29:59,082
Garcia, we really need to gain
administrative access to the website.

497
00:29:59,109 --> 00:30:02,060
I've written down a number of things
Christopher may have used as the password.

498
00:30:02,155 --> 00:30:04,919
I've already eliminated birthdays, holidays,
pet names, and pop culture icons.

499
00:30:05,044 --> 00:30:08,513
No, there was something pathetic
about him, not criminal.

500
00:30:09,534 --> 00:30:11,600
When he was leaving,
he said he misses his mom.

501
00:30:13,718 --> 00:30:15,863
- What's his mother's name?
- Cynthia summers.

502
00:30:16,428 --> 00:30:17,343
That's it.

503
00:30:17,371 --> 00:30:19,694
All right log in as administrator,
shut down the main source.

504
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:21,605
Already on it, my friend.

505
00:30:22,273 --> 00:30:25,009
Kids are still posting videos
through independent servers.

506
00:30:25,134 --> 00:30:29,317
Pull up the website history. See if you
can learn anything from historical posts.

507
00:30:31,076 --> 00:30:33,456
Christopher's er eval
shows his bruises

508
00:30:33,624 --> 00:30:37,042
were caused by manual
and ligature strangulation over time.

509
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,580
- Take a look at this.
- He's also shown To have

510
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,797
layered bruising on his sternum.

511
00:30:42,167 --> 00:30:43,799
It looks like a cpr artifact.

512
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,990
But there's no record
of resuscitations.

513
00:30:47,614 --> 00:30:50,293
Wait, all these transmissions are
transcripts of the same administrator?

514
00:30:50,347 --> 00:30:51,755
Yeah, there's only one handle.

515
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,696
This is weird.
In the posts his voice changes.

516
00:30:53,277 --> 00:30:55,506
At times he's using more articles,
more precise verbiage,

517
00:30:55,626 --> 00:30:58,841
Like he's trying to throw us off. That's
pretty sophisticated behavior for a kid.

518
00:30:58,842 --> 00:31:01,243
A writer can disguise
his own writing style

519
00:31:01,244 --> 00:31:03,244
To make himself appear
younger or less educated.

520
00:31:03,246 --> 00:31:05,606
Yeah, but it's virtually impossible to
pull off making yourself appear older

521
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:07,281
And more educated than you actually are.

522
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:09,206
There are actually 2
distinct writing style.

523
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:11,932
2 writers using the same screen name
One teen and one adult.

524
00:31:11,979 --> 00:31:13,913
Christopher was being
manipulated by an adult.

525
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,329
The mother's death is a textbook
case of munchausen by proxy.

526
00:31:16,373 --> 00:31:17,632
Surreptitious poisoning.

527
00:31:17,674 --> 00:31:20,446
The kid has been choked and
revived on multiple occasions.

528
00:31:20,471 --> 00:31:22,662
You said the father worked for
the fire department, right?

529
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:25,121
Yeah, for a couple of months now.
In what capacity?

530
00:31:25,666 --> 00:31:26,798
As an emt.

531
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,733
Emt. That's our unsub.

532
00:31:32,053 --> 00:31:33,571
Christopher didn't even understand

533
00:31:33,572 --> 00:31:35,172
The wiping systems on his computer.

534
00:31:35,173 --> 00:31:36,840
So the father poses as a classmate

535
00:31:36,841 --> 00:31:38,675
And invites local kids to join the game.

536
00:31:38,676 --> 00:31:41,458
Bumps up the stakes and encourages
them to use their riskiest methods.

537
00:31:41,578 --> 00:31:42,878
He works on Friday nights.

538
00:31:42,879 --> 00:31:44,816
Which means he gets called
out to do the rescues.

539
00:31:44,837 --> 00:31:47,238
He's not just collecting video tapes.
His munchausen has evolved.

540
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:48,983
I'll put out an apb for his truck.

541
00:31:48,984 --> 00:31:51,648
He'll find a place to download the
video tapes. They're his trophies.

542
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:53,954
After that, he'll clean up his mess.

543
00:31:53,955 --> 00:31:56,557
Christopher's the only
witness against him.

544
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:33,903
Clear.

545
00:32:38,063 --> 00:32:39,216
Clear!

546
00:32:41,736 --> 00:32:43,093
You need to see this.

547
00:32:45,032 --> 00:32:46,972
There's dozens of discs here.

548
00:32:46,973 --> 00:32:49,478
I was right here.
I never even looked around.

549
00:32:49,538 --> 00:32:51,392
Well, we only had
consent for the laptop,

550
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:52,812
And he knew it was encrypted.

551
00:32:52,813 --> 00:32:54,996
We didn't have probable
cause for a warrant.

552
00:32:55,033 --> 00:32:57,483
Mr. Summers didn't have a chance
to come back and get his trophies.

553
00:32:57,484 --> 00:32:59,514
He'll definitely try to
download the videos tonight.

554
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,640
This kid was doing everything
he could just to survive.

555
00:33:01,659 --> 00:33:04,222
The extreme abuse conditioned
him to shield his father.

556
00:33:04,223 --> 00:33:06,957
When his father came in the room,
he seemed genuinely relieved.

557
00:33:06,958 --> 00:33:08,325
His burden had been lifted.

558
00:33:08,326 --> 00:33:10,527
He was elated when his
father rescued him.

559
00:33:10,528 --> 00:33:13,196
We need to rethink everything.

560
00:33:13,197 --> 00:33:15,120
Where are we going?

561
00:33:19,501 --> 00:33:22,002
To see your mom.

562
00:33:26,301 --> 00:33:28,507
Now, let's focus on the behavior.
What's the pattern?

563
00:33:28,508 --> 00:33:31,512
Things boil over, the father moves on.

564
00:33:31,513 --> 00:33:33,616
New town, new sadistic m.O.

565
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:36,100
Christopher knows his father's pattern.

566
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,816
So that we can uncover the truth.

567
00:33:39,655 --> 00:33:40,962
sure you will.

568
00:33:42,347 --> 00:33:43,185
Truth.

569
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:47,174
In his mind, it will never end.

570
00:33:47,229 --> 00:33:49,243
Unless christopher's decided to end it.

571
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:54,165
Garcia? Yes, sir?

572
00:33:54,202 --> 00:33:55,799
When you were talking to christopher,

573
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,181
Did he say anything to you to
suggest that he was giving up?

574
00:33:58,301 --> 00:33:59,101
Giving up?

575
00:33:59,221 --> 00:34:00,928
Was he trying to say good-bye?

576
00:34:01,048 --> 00:34:02,129
I don't understand.

577
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:03,621
Did he give you anything?

578
00:34:03,632 --> 00:34:04,941
Yeah. How did you know that?

579
00:34:04,983 --> 00:34:06,087
What did he give you?

580
00:34:06,163 --> 00:34:07,461
When--when we were talking,

581
00:34:07,513 --> 00:34:09,090
He gave me this pirate's earring.

582
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:12,228
He's made up his mind. Suicide, the
only victory over his sadistic father.

583
00:34:12,348 --> 00:34:14,534
He may also see it as
reuniting with his mother.

584
00:34:14,546 --> 00:34:17,248
The father's going to want to download
Those videos from somewhere, garcia

585
00:34:17,251 --> 00:34:18,751
And we got to stop that process.

586
00:34:18,757 --> 00:34:21,236
I'm already on that. I replaced
the website with a phishing site.

587
00:34:21,302 --> 00:34:23,558
I'm downloading it to the servers now.

588
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:24,961
When he logs onto that website,

589
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,723
He's going to be rerouted to our server,
And we can capture his information.

590
00:34:27,725 --> 00:34:29,259
Stay on that site, garcia.

591
00:34:32,903 --> 00:34:34,085
Let's go. Come on.

592
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,535
It will buy us some time.
Where are they headed?

593
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:42,784
Wait. What about the mother?
It's all about the mother.

594
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,713
Garcia, where is cynthia summers buried?

595
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:45,822
Give me a second.

596
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:48,233
You know, for christopher, a cemetery
would be a place of refuge,

597
00:34:48,353 --> 00:34:51,089
But for the father... He's
revisiting a body disposal site.

598
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:53,927
Oaklawn cemetery,
halfway between here and glenrock.

599
00:34:53,938 --> 00:34:55,866
Ok. He would willingly
go there with his father.

600
00:34:55,891 --> 00:34:57,940
Well, the father still needs
to download the videos.

601
00:34:57,996 --> 00:34:58,935
And he might need a power source.

602
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:00,729
There's a chapel.
They use it for burials.

603
00:35:00,739 --> 00:35:03,186
Let's go. Garcia,
we'll call you from the car.

604
00:35:07,737 --> 00:35:09,864
You know the drill.
This won't take long.

605
00:35:20,169 --> 00:35:21,536
That's his suv.

606
00:35:22,324 --> 00:35:23,400
yeah, garcia?

607
00:35:23,444 --> 00:35:24,866
Sir, mr. Summers just logged on.

608
00:35:24,904 --> 00:35:27,239
He's caught in the phishing site.
Is he downloading the videos?

609
00:35:27,245 --> 00:35:29,311
He's trying to, but all
he's going to get is snow.

610
00:35:30,344 --> 00:35:32,478
Oh, come on.

611
00:35:43,752 --> 00:35:45,756
I don't want to die.

612
00:35:45,757 --> 00:35:47,547
I decide when you die.

613
00:35:49,067 --> 00:35:49,837
Fbi!

614
00:36:37,438 --> 00:36:38,514
You guys good?

615
00:36:45,686 --> 00:36:48,877
Well, I can't tell you how much I
appreciate y'all coming out here.

616
00:36:49,712 --> 00:36:52,447
I'm just glad it ended up ok.

617
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:57,384
Oh, come on. Smal
l-time county sheriff calls the fbi

618
00:36:57,385 --> 00:36:59,953
About potential suicides,
and you drop what you're doing

619
00:36:59,954 --> 00:37:00,988
And you come here?

620
00:37:00,994 --> 00:37:02,956
We're an asset for all
levels of law enforcement.

621
00:37:02,957 --> 00:37:04,024
It's what we do.

622
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:07,227
Well, it's incredible.

623
00:37:07,834 --> 00:37:08,823
Thank you.

624
00:37:09,788 --> 00:37:11,512
Would you like to come with us?

625
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:14,701
We're going to tell the
parents what really happened.

626
00:37:14,702 --> 00:37:17,785
Uh, no. We need to be getting back.

627
00:37:17,815 --> 00:37:18,847
You sure?

628
00:37:19,873 --> 00:37:21,741
I mean, I know it won't bring them back,

629
00:37:21,742 --> 00:37:24,214
But I would think that knowing

630
00:37:24,483 --> 00:37:27,242
That it wasn't intentional might
bring some level of comfort.

631
00:37:27,362 --> 00:37:29,213
It will, definitely.

632
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:32,605
You go ahead. Good luck, sheriff.

633
00:37:34,162 --> 00:37:35,707
Well, thank you.

634
00:37:48,247 --> 00:37:49,172
What is that?

635
00:37:49,292 --> 00:37:51,394
It's called a star puzzle.

636
00:37:51,395 --> 00:37:54,044
It's basically impossible to figure out.

637
00:37:54,049 --> 00:37:57,456
You have to put all of the pieces
back together to form a perfect star.

638
00:37:57,576 --> 00:38:01,903
But the origin of it is, um,
kind of a romantic tale.

639
00:38:02,432 --> 00:38:05,739
There was this young prince

640
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:07,515
Who wanted to win the heart

641
00:38:07,635 --> 00:38:09,977
Of the fairest maiden in the land,

642
00:38:09,978 --> 00:38:14,181
So he climbed to the top of the
tallest tower in the kingdom,

643
00:38:14,182 --> 00:38:16,484
And he caught a falling star for her.

644
00:38:16,485 --> 00:38:19,220
Unfortunately, he was so excited,
he dropped it,

645
00:38:19,221 --> 00:38:21,390
And it smashed into all of these pieces,

646
00:38:21,391 --> 00:38:24,508
So he frantically put
it back together again

647
00:38:24,628 --> 00:38:26,576
To prove his undying love to her,

648
00:38:26,614 --> 00:38:29,398
And he succeeded,
and they lived happily ever after.

649
00:38:29,399 --> 00:38:31,967
That doesn't make any sense.

650
00:38:32,341 --> 00:38:33,517
What do you mean?

651
00:38:33,803 --> 00:38:35,725
You can't catch a falling star.

652
00:38:35,845 --> 00:38:37,406
It would burn up in the atmosphere.

653
00:38:37,407 --> 00:38:41,102
Yeah, but it's not literal, reid.
It's a fable.

654
00:38:41,222 --> 00:38:43,445
But there's no moral.
Fables have morals.

655
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:46,081
Ok. So it's just a
romantic little story.

656
00:38:46,082 --> 00:38:48,617
And the point is,
it's basically impossible to do

657
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:50,619
because you have to
take all of those pieces

658
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,821
And put them together exactly...

659
00:38:57,227 --> 00:38:59,528
There's a lot to hate
about you, dr. Reid.

660
00:39:00,217 --> 00:39:02,698
Play poker with him sometime.

661
00:39:02,699 --> 00:39:04,256
Try playing chess with him.

662
00:39:04,376 --> 00:39:05,151
Or go.

663
00:39:10,573 --> 00:39:11,740
Hey.

664
00:39:11,741 --> 00:39:12,956
Hey. Coffee?

665
00:39:13,013 --> 00:39:13,932
Thanks.

666
00:39:14,052 --> 00:39:16,178
I just wanted to say thank you.

667
00:39:16,179 --> 00:39:19,381
If you hadn't pushed it,
we would never have gone.

668
00:39:26,189 --> 00:39:28,090
Hotch... J.J.,

669
00:39:28,091 --> 00:39:30,053
You don't have to.

670
00:39:35,491 --> 00:39:36,564
My sister

671
00:39:37,646 --> 00:39:40,205
Gave this to me when I was 11.

672
00:39:41,204 --> 00:39:45,006
She just came into my
bedroom one afternoon

673
00:39:45,126 --> 00:39:47,610
And told me that no
matter what happened,

674
00:39:47,611 --> 00:39:49,145
She loved me.

675
00:39:51,816 --> 00:39:53,817
This was her favorite necklace,

676
00:39:53,818 --> 00:39:55,772
So I told her I couldn't take it,

677
00:39:56,298 --> 00:39:58,354
But she insisted.

678
00:39:59,539 --> 00:40:02,280
I, of course, was secretly very happy,

679
00:40:02,311 --> 00:40:04,894
'cause I always wanted
one just like hers.

680
00:40:10,167 --> 00:40:12,628
That's the last time-- I never...

681
00:40:13,738 --> 00:40:14,868
I'm sorry.

682
00:40:18,521 --> 00:40:20,811
I think about her every day.

683
00:40:26,662 --> 00:40:28,795
It does get better, hotch.

684
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:35,847
Losing someone is... Never easy.

685
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,773
But one day,

686
00:40:41,161 --> 00:40:43,766
You'll remember her, and it won't hurt.

687
00:40:48,068 --> 00:40:49,363
You'll be happy.

688
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:51,327
Thank you.

689
00:40:52,723 --> 00:40:54,331
Thank you for everything.

690
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:07,455
"experience is a brutal teacher,
but you learn.

691
00:41:07,456 --> 00:41:11,158
My god, do you learn." c.S. Lewis.
