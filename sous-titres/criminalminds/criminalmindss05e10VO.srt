00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:32,572
<i>W.S. Gilbert wrote,</i>

2
00:00:33,078 --> 00:00:35,660
<i>"It's love that makes</i>
<i>the world go 'round."</i>

3
00:00:36,776 --> 00:00:40,292
And if that's true, then the world
spun a little faster with Haley in it.

4
00:00:42,369 --> 00:00:45,496
Haley was my best friend
since we were in high school.

5
00:00:46,651 --> 00:00:48,910
We certainly had
our struggles, but...

6
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:52,160
if there's one thing
we agreed on unconditionally,

7
00:00:52,762 --> 00:00:55,502
it was our love and commitment
to our son Jack.

8
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,598
Haley's love for Jack was joyous

9
00:01:00,636 --> 00:01:01,673
and fierce.

10
00:01:04,257 --> 00:01:06,736
That fierceness is why
she isn't here today.

11
00:01:08,332 --> 00:01:10,970
A mother's love is an unrivaled
force of nature.

12
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:16,135
And we can all learn much
from the way Haley lived her life.

13
00:01:18,501 --> 00:01:21,198
Haley's death causes
each of us to stop

14
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,504
and take stock of our lives.

15
00:01:24,504 --> 00:01:26,054
To measure who we are

16
00:01:26,835 --> 00:01:28,504
and what we've become.

17
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:33,104
I don't have all those
answers for myself,

18
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:35,746
but I know who Haley was.

19
00:01:37,037 --> 00:01:38,457
She was the woman who died

20
00:01:38,582 --> 00:01:41,462
protecting the child we brought
into this world together.

21
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:45,604
And I will make sure that Jack
grows up knowing who his mother was

22
00:01:46,588 --> 00:01:48,441
and how she loved and protected him

23
00:01:49,766 --> 00:01:51,200
and how much I loved her.

24
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,552
If Haley were with us today,

25
00:01:55,677 --> 00:01:57,742
she would ask us
not to mourn her death

26
00:01:58,169 --> 00:01:59,814
but to celebrate her life.

27
00:02:05,014 --> 00:02:06,238
She would tell us...

28
00:02:10,306 --> 00:02:13,299
she would tell us to love
our families unconditionally...

29
00:02:14,922 --> 00:02:16,189
and to hold them close,

30
00:02:16,314 --> 00:02:18,448
because in the end,
they are all that matter.

31
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,714
I met Haley at the tryouts

32
00:02:21,839 --> 00:02:24,877
of our high school's production
of "The pirates Of Penzance."

33
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,825
I found our copy of the play

34
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,351
and was looking through it
the other night, and I...

35
00:02:29,934 --> 00:02:32,385
came upon a passage that seemed...

36
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,280
appropriate for this moment.

37
00:02:35,604 --> 00:02:37,617
Dry the glistening tear

38
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,660
that dews that martial cheek.

39
00:02:42,147 --> 00:02:44,084
Thy loving children hear,

40
00:02:45,051 --> 00:02:46,740
in them thy comfort seek.

41
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,696
With sympathetic care

42
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:52,823
their arms around thee creep,

43
00:02:54,693 --> 00:02:56,419
for, oh, they cannot bear

44
00:02:57,253 --> 00:02:58,957
to see their father weep.

45
00:03:16,928 --> 00:03:18,530
Ok, you can go ahead.

46
00:03:23,285 --> 00:03:24,718
Blow mommy a kiss.

47
00:03:39,477 --> 00:03:41,064
If there's anything I can do...

48
00:03:41,189 --> 00:03:42,137
Thank you.

49
00:03:43,581 --> 00:03:45,156
I'm so sorry for your loss.

50
00:03:45,281 --> 00:03:47,251
Thank you, Gina.
Thank you for coming.

51
00:03:49,887 --> 00:03:52,189
I think you could use some air.

52
00:03:53,621 --> 00:03:54,647
Jack's ok.

53
00:03:54,814 --> 00:03:56,538
I saw him with his cousins.
Ok.

54
00:03:57,163 --> 00:04:00,373
Jessica, would you make sure
that Jack gets something to eat?

55
00:04:00,498 --> 00:04:02,210
- Sure.
- And I'll be right back.

56
00:04:02,335 --> 00:04:03,223
Thanks.

57
00:04:11,365 --> 00:04:12,565
What do we do?

58
00:04:13,664 --> 00:04:15,048
There's nothing we can do.

59
00:04:15,372 --> 00:04:16,844
We just gotta wait him out.

60
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,883
You think he'll ever come back?

61
00:04:19,187 --> 00:04:21,302
- Would you?
- He'll come back.

62
00:04:21,545 --> 00:04:23,938
I just don't know what
he's gonna look like when he does.

63
00:04:24,608 --> 00:04:27,349
We just need to be there
for him when he's ready.

64
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,604
You know, I broke
my promise to Haley.

65
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:33,397
What promise?

66
00:04:34,413 --> 00:04:37,143
I told her that I would
catch Foyet and that I'd...

67
00:04:37,268 --> 00:04:39,862
spend the rest of my life
making it up to her.

68
00:04:40,432 --> 00:04:41,896
You still can.

69
00:04:42,464 --> 00:04:43,899
You saved Jack.

70
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,543
You know, I may have
the tools to do this job,

71
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:57,517
but I don't know if I have
the tools to help my son.

72
00:04:59,471 --> 00:05:00,929
You have to ask yourself

73
00:05:01,286 --> 00:05:03,481
what kind of father you want to be.

74
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,198
And when you figure that out...

75
00:05:07,477 --> 00:05:09,225
then you'll know what to do.

76
00:05:15,488 --> 00:05:17,060
I meant what I said today.

77
00:05:17,185 --> 00:05:18,587
Things have changed.

78
00:05:20,314 --> 00:05:22,670
And I need to do
what's best for Jack.

79
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:26,255
You will.

80
00:05:35,977 --> 00:05:37,923
They can't be calling us in,
not tonight.

81
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,273
I'm on it.

82
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:42,299
We can't go.

83
00:05:43,573 --> 00:05:44,768
We have to.

84
00:05:44,893 --> 00:05:46,066
I'll get Rossi.

85
00:05:46,643 --> 00:05:48,847
Talk to Strauss,
tell her to send another team.

86
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:51,322
There's no other team available.

87
00:05:51,447 --> 00:05:52,893
Nashville's calling us in.

88
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:56,411
Second body in 2 weeks, both killed
on consecutive friday nights.

89
00:05:56,536 --> 00:05:58,460
They realize they're
up against the clock

90
00:05:58,585 --> 00:06:01,001
and they're hoping we might
find something they didn't.

91
00:06:05,715 --> 00:06:06,535
Guys.

92
00:06:07,683 --> 00:06:09,451
I'm sorry,
but we just got called in.

93
00:06:10,816 --> 00:06:11,868
We have to go.

94
00:06:11,993 --> 00:06:13,635
Call me if you need anything.

95
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:15,791
Take care of your son.

96
00:06:16,426 --> 00:06:17,274
Thanks.

97
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,029
You gonna be ok?

98
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,898
I'll see you when you get back.

99
00:06:48,691 --> 00:06:50,713
<i>Where we love is home...</i>

100
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,855
<i>home that our feet may leave,</i>

101
00:06:53,042 --> 00:06:54,411
<i>but not our hearts.</i>

102
00:06:54,933 --> 00:06:56,276
<i>Oliver Wendell Holmes.</i>

103
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,220
Two women dead in two weeks,

104
00:07:02,345 --> 00:07:05,188
both killed in their own homes,
and no sign of forced entry.

105
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:08,235
Floors were covered in rose petals.

106
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,384
Quite the romantic.
Evidence of sexual assault?

107
00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:12,473
None.

108
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:15,184
Both women were last seen
leaving their offices on a friday

109
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,302
and never showed up
to work on a monday.

110
00:07:17,427 --> 00:07:19,813
It's thursday. Why are we
only being called in now?

111
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,807
The second body
was only found yesterday.

112
00:07:21,904 --> 00:07:24,264
There may be a socio-economic
pattern emerging.

113
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:26,153
The first victim, Bethany Heminger,

114
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,777
lived in Belle Meade,
Melissa Johnson in Brentwood.

115
00:07:28,902 --> 00:07:30,433
Both are affluent neighborhoods.

116
00:07:30,558 --> 00:07:32,633
Yet there was nothing missing
from either home.

117
00:07:32,758 --> 00:07:34,354
What did these women do
for a living?

118
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,035
Bethany was a defense attorney,
Melissa a corporate executive.

119
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,925
Two brunettes with similar features

120
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:41,573
in high-powered professions?
That's not a coincidence.

121
00:07:41,698 --> 00:07:44,319
These women most likely
represent someone he knows.

122
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,383
All right, so we need
to figure out where this unsub

123
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,842
is meeting his victims and how
he's gaining access to their homes.

124
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,418
And if he's staying on pattern,

125
00:07:50,543 --> 00:07:52,731
most likely this guy has
picked out his next target.

126
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,598
We should check gardeners,

127
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:57,226
housekeeping staff, pool attendants,

128
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:58,329
floral shops,

129
00:07:58,454 --> 00:08:00,246
see if anyone worked both homes.

130
00:08:00,371 --> 00:08:02,189
Start working up
a paper trail, Garcia.

131
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,931
Find out where these women were
in the days leading up to each murder.

132
00:08:05,056 --> 00:08:06,887
Like a genie in a bottle... poof!

133
00:08:08,513 --> 00:08:09,414
All right.

134
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:12,216
Prentiss, you and I are gonna go
check out the Johnson crime scene.

135
00:08:12,341 --> 00:08:15,119
Rossi, you and Reid talk to the coroner,
start working up victimology.

136
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:18,660
JJ, talk to the families and staff
and find a connection we can use.

137
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,168
I understand that all
of our thoughts are with Hotch.

138
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,718
But right now, I need us all
to focus on this case.

139
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,174
We have less than a day
before this unsub will strike again.

140
00:08:30,808 --> 00:08:32,695
Let's finish this thing fast.

141
00:08:45,064 --> 00:08:47,526
You must be the FBI.
Landon Kaminski.

142
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,319
Agent Jareau.
We spoke on the phone.

143
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,477
It's nice to meet you.
The mayor's on my ass.

144
00:08:51,483 --> 00:08:53,133
Two prominent women killed
on my watch

145
00:08:53,148 --> 00:08:54,969
and everyone knows
we're bracing for a third.

146
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:57,617
Well, let's hope that doesn't happen.
Where would you like us to set up?

147
00:08:57,742 --> 00:08:58,736
In here.

148
00:08:59,863 --> 00:09:02,379
I'm gonna need to issue
a statement with the press.

149
00:09:02,504 --> 00:09:05,730
Every woman in Nashville needs to know
there's a serial killer on the loose.

150
00:09:05,855 --> 00:09:07,858
We need them taking
preventative measures

151
00:09:07,983 --> 00:09:09,506
to avoid becoming his next target.

152
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,259
The mayor thinks we should be
as specific as possible.

153
00:09:12,749 --> 00:09:14,800
Every woman, detective.

154
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,588
His first 2 victims may be
from the same social class,

155
00:09:17,713 --> 00:09:20,079
but if we isolate
victimology this soon,

156
00:09:20,204 --> 00:09:22,471
it may cause him to go outside
of his own comfort zone,

157
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:24,418
and then he'll be
even harder to track.

158
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:27,865
Better to stress hypervigilance and
shut down his victim pool completely,

159
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,026
don't you think?

160
00:09:30,902 --> 00:09:31,820
Yes, ma'am.

161
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:38,713
Well, the house has
a security system,

162
00:09:38,838 --> 00:09:41,974
but her friends say that she only
used it when she traveled out of town.

163
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,703
He killed the dog,

164
00:09:43,828 --> 00:09:45,897
hid it in a storage
container in the garage.

165
00:09:46,022 --> 00:09:48,360
She probably thought
he was protection enough.

166
00:09:48,485 --> 00:09:50,077
That was her first mistake.

167
00:09:50,202 --> 00:09:52,200
She had all the precautions
to avoid home invasion,

168
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:53,876
she just didn't use them properly.

169
00:09:54,001 --> 00:09:56,261
These are the prints
that match the other crime scene.

170
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,586
It looks like he didn't hesitate
to get them everywhere.

171
00:09:58,711 --> 00:10:01,242
Which typically would indicate
that he's disorganized.

172
00:10:01,946 --> 00:10:04,509
This crime scene screams
of organization.

173
00:10:04,921 --> 00:10:06,326
The roses,

174
00:10:06,451 --> 00:10:07,608
the dog.

175
00:10:08,284 --> 00:10:09,797
He was a stranger to these women.

176
00:10:09,837 --> 00:10:11,819
He didn't talk his way in,
he was laying in wait.

177
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:14,852
And he knew his prints wouldn't
show up in the system.

178
00:10:15,353 --> 00:10:18,698
He had no priors, which means
he was smart and most likely educated.

179
00:10:18,876 --> 00:10:20,601
This guy knew exactly
what he was doing

180
00:10:20,726 --> 00:10:22,542
and he made sure he had
enough time to do it.

181
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:26,018
So, he knew when she'd leave
the house and when she'd return.

182
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:28,069
He's stalking them.

183
00:10:51,888 --> 00:10:54,704
It's only the victim's prints
on the exterior doorknobs.

184
00:10:54,829 --> 00:10:57,491
Nothing on the windows,
the garage wasn't forced.

185
00:10:57,616 --> 00:10:59,046
So how did he get in?

186
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:05,001
Defensive wounds on both women.

187
00:11:05,126 --> 00:11:06,820
More so on the latest victim.

188
00:11:07,423 --> 00:11:11,064
- She fought back the hardest.
- No ligature marks. They weren't bound.

189
00:11:11,189 --> 00:11:12,959
So how does he keep them
from running out?

190
00:11:13,084 --> 00:11:15,868
Maybe he blocked the escape route, or
maybe the threat of a knife was enough.

191
00:11:15,993 --> 00:11:19,039
I might be able to answer that. The stab
wounds weren't the only injuries.

192
00:11:19,164 --> 00:11:20,171
What do you mean?

193
00:11:20,296 --> 00:11:22,155
Melissa Johnson had a concussion.

194
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,141
Bethany Heminger, a broken rib.

195
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,994
An initial assault
to prove his dominance,

196
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:29,813
make sure they're too scared
to try and escape.

197
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,982
Something else you should see.

198
00:11:33,831 --> 00:11:35,762
Both their stomach contents
were the same.

199
00:11:35,887 --> 00:11:39,097
Chicken, broccoli,
pasta, salad, and red wine.

200
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,283
He's playing out a fantasy.

201
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,037
One he has to control.

202
00:11:43,162 --> 00:11:46,371
He sets the scene
with flower petals and wine

203
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:48,350
and then he cooks for them.

204
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:49,864
Their last supper.

205
00:11:51,418 --> 00:11:53,793
So he cooked, and he cleaned
up after himself.

206
00:11:53,918 --> 00:11:55,865
Why did he leave the petal trail?

207
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,832
It's gotta mean something our guy.

208
00:11:57,957 --> 00:12:00,302
He's not just reliving a fantasy,
he's repeating it.

209
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,549
It's the same routine,
the same meal.

210
00:12:02,976 --> 00:12:04,440
It's not just routine,

211
00:12:04,565 --> 00:12:06,050
it's proper etiquette.

212
00:12:06,586 --> 00:12:07,527
What?

213
00:12:07,652 --> 00:12:08,960
Take a look at this.

214
00:12:09,085 --> 00:12:12,033
There's a handprint in the center
back of this chair right here.

215
00:12:12,158 --> 00:12:14,336
He pulled this chair
out for himself.

216
00:12:14,461 --> 00:12:17,486
Over here, there are handprints
on either side of the chair.

217
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:20,330
He pulled this chair out for her,

218
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:22,003
poured her wine...

219
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,783
and even cleaned up
after the meal was done.

220
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,481
But up he something changed.

221
00:12:27,606 --> 00:12:29,331
Then he drew her a bath.

222
00:12:29,456 --> 00:12:31,333
And this is where Melissa Johnson
was murdered.

223
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:34,521
- This is where the fantasy ended.
- Because she broke it?

224
00:12:34,646 --> 00:12:36,673
- I would.
- What do you mean?

225
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:39,799
Well, after the initial
assault downstairs,

226
00:12:39,924 --> 00:12:41,794
fine, I'm scared,

227
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:44,221
but I'm still looking
for another chance to escape.

228
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,851
Dinner, wine, dies.

229
00:12:46,979 --> 00:12:49,658
I'm not in any immediate danger,
so I **c take my time,

230
00:12:49,783 --> 00:12:51,258
wait for the right moment.

231
00:12:51,383 --> 00:12:53,855
I do what he says because
I don't want him to hurt me again.

232
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,316
But once he gets me in here,

233
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,275
I am at my most vulnerable.

234
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,743
So fear takes over
and she fights back.

235
00:13:02,141 --> 00:13:03,725
Because if she doesn't...

236
00:13:05,388 --> 00:13:07,939
home is where you're
su*osed to feel safe.

237
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,593
Nobody deserves
to have that taken away.

238
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,794
<i>That's it!</i>

239
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:24,853
<i>All right, right in there!</i>

240
00:13:36,546 --> 00:13:38,300
Buddy, it time for pjs.

241
00:13:38,483 --> 00:13:40,599
Can I watch one more time?

242
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:42,612
I'm waiting for mommy.

243
00:13:44,415 --> 00:13:46,627
<i>All right, ready to make a wish.</i>

244
00:13:47,169 --> 00:13:48,262
<i>Ok. 1...</i>

245
00:13:49,022 --> 00:13:49,862
<i>2...</i>

246
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:51,750
<i>3.
Blow 'em out!</i>

247
00:13:54,474 --> 00:13:55,979
<i>Nice job!</i>

248
00:13:57,327 --> 00:13:59,135
<i>Happy birthday.</i>
<i>Say, hi, daddy.</i>

249
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,223
<i>Hi, daddy.</i>

250
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:03,028
<i>- Let's give him a big kiss.</i>
- I miss her, too.

251
00:14:04,862 --> 00:14:07,516
Can I sleep in your room again?

252
00:14:07,641 --> 00:14:08,521
Sure.

253
00:14:11,295 --> 00:14:12,374
Ok, come on.

254
00:14:25,103 --> 00:14:26,150
Find anything?

255
00:14:26,275 --> 00:14:28,212
Several people had access
to each home.

256
00:14:28,337 --> 00:14:30,721
Housekeeper, gardener,
pool cleaner, dog walker,

257
00:14:30,846 --> 00:14:33,472
each with their own key
and an alibI to match.

258
00:14:33,597 --> 00:14:35,332
- Any cross-over?
- None.

259
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,172
We even vetted delivery people
and utility workers.

260
00:14:38,198 --> 00:14:39,578
Garcia, do you have anything?

261
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,332
There's no hits
on the prints at all,

262
00:14:41,351 --> 00:14:43,951
but I did what sir derek there asked
and I created a paper trail.

263
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,110
There's no cross-over between
the two victims themselves

264
00:14:46,129 --> 00:14:47,894
in the wee leading
up to their murders,

265
00:14:47,932 --> 00:14:49,629
but they did run in similar circles.

266
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:50,681
How do you mean?

267
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,491
They both have country club
memberships,

268
00:14:52,509 --> 00:14:53,833
though to different clubs.

269
00:14:53,864 --> 00:14:55,381
They went to upscale restaurants,

270
00:14:55,448 --> 00:14:57,514
private concert venues, posh hotels.

271
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:00,580
They enjoyed a high-class,
highfalutin lifestyle,

272
00:15:00,606 --> 00:15:01,761
an expensive one.

273
00:15:01,827 --> 00:15:03,444
A lifestyle he'd fit right into.

274
00:15:03,491 --> 00:15:06,275
This g is educated,
intelligent, proper.

275
00:15:06,303 --> 00:15:07,805
He's a downright gentleman.

276
00:15:07,847 --> 00:15:09,876
The rose petals sent
a pretty specific message.

277
00:15:09,904 --> 00:15:11,754
He's romancinghem
whether they want it or not.

278
00:15:11,772 --> 00:15:13,538
He's got the social skills
to back it up.

279
00:15:13,566 --> 00:15:15,351
Hey, Garcia, take a look
at dating services

280
00:15:15,417 --> 00:15:16,780
and social networking sites.

281
00:15:16,847 --> 00:15:19,487
Look for working professionals
and privileged elite.

282
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,880
Check, check, and checkers.

283
00:15:20,947 --> 00:15:22,548
Back in a smidge.

284
00:15:23,266 --> 00:15:24,350
We need more.

285
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:26,647
Have we figured out how
he's getting into these homes?

286
00:15:27,018 --> 00:15:28,923
No sign of forced entry anywhere.

287
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:31,337
Yet he's still gaining
access to their homes

288
00:15:31,355 --> 00:15:33,740
long before the victims
ever get home from work.

289
00:15:33,844 --> 00:15:36,742
I mean, this guy needs time to cook
and set up his scene.

290
00:15:36,781 --> 00:15:39,109
He's either got a key
or he can move through walls.

291
00:15:39,156 --> 00:15:40,517
We need fresh eyes.

292
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:41,886
All right, listen up.

293
00:15:41,923 --> 00:15:43,965
I want everybody to go back
to the hotel and try to get some rest.

294
00:15:44,003 --> 00:15:45,647
We're gonna have to pick this up
again in the morning.

295
00:15:45,713 --> 00:15:47,081
We're giving up?

296
00:15:47,499 --> 00:15:49,446
No.
We're gonna take a break.

297
00:15:49,513 --> 00:15:51,381
We have to give the profile
at morning roll

298
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:53,143
and none of us has slept
nce the funeral.

299
00:15:53,209 --> 00:15:54,916
Once Garcia can get us
a paper trail,

300
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,816
then we can expand our canvass.

301
00:15:57,314 --> 00:15:59,957
Till then there's really
not a lot we can do.

302
00:16:15,047 --> 00:16:17,914
Would you please turn the music off?

303
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:20,600
But it's your favorite song.

304
00:16:26,859 --> 00:16:28,622
How do you know that?

305
00:16:33,902 --> 00:16:36,951
It's the most played song
on your ipod.

306
00:16:42,895 --> 00:16:44,294
No! No! Stop!

307
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,407
Stop it.

308
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:51,647
You're ruining it.

309
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:55,181
I'm sorry.
I won't do it again.

310
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:58,676
Ease.
I'll do whatever you want.

311
00:17:01,493 --> 00:17:03,932
I've put a lot of time and effort

312
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,215
into making this a special night.

313
00:17:06,507 --> 00:17:09,526
Is it too much to ask
for a little appreciation?

314
00:17:09,676 --> 00:17:10,691
I'm sorry.

315
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:12,929
I won't do it again.

316
00:17:13,004 --> 00:17:13,879
Please.

317
00:17:14,747 --> 00:17:16,647
I'll do whatever you want.

318
00:17:18,854 --> 00:17:19,802
That's ok.

319
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:21,967
I forgive you.

320
00:17:23,247 --> 00:17:25,181
A little misunderstanding, right?

321
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,414
Yes. That's right.

322
00:17:27,905 --> 00:17:29,839
I'll just forget all about this.

323
00:17:32,465 --> 00:17:33,554
Yes, please.

324
00:17:35,748 --> 00:17:36,640
Now...

325
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,224
I think it's t for your bath.

326
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,546
Ok, Jack, listen,

327
00:17:54,584 --> 00:17:57,166
I want you to figure out where
you want to put all your toys, ok?

328
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,057
Ok, daddy.

329
00:17:58,094 --> 00:17:59,371
Alright, sweet boy.

330
00:18:10,354 --> 00:18:12,481
Chief Strauss, I appreciate
your coming to me.

331
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:13,622
Of course.

332
00:18:13,641 --> 00:18:16,063
This isn't a time for you
to be away from your son.

333
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:17,040
Come in.

334
00:18:19,526 --> 00:18:21,883
Jack, can you say *llo
to chief strauss?

335
00:18:23,588 --> 00:18:25,081
- Hi, Jack.
- Hi.

336
00:18:27,563 --> 00:18:28,605
Have a seat.

337
00:18:30,381 --> 00:18:32,944
So, how are you holding up?

338
00:18:33,842 --> 00:18:34,647
I'm ok.

339
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:35,894
And how's Jack?

340
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,003
He's coping.

341
00:18:38,157 --> 00:18:41,170
I don't think he fully understands
everything that's going on.

342
00:18:41,189 --> 00:18:43,246
Oh, right, well, how could he?

343
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,316
You said that there was something
you wanted to discuss with me?

344
00:18:47,363 --> 00:18:48,452
Yes, I do.

345
00:18:56,485 --> 00:18:57,790
Thiss retirement.

346
00:18:59,424 --> 00:19:01,274
I've talked with the director.

347
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,514
Given the circumstances,

348
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,258
there's no reason you should have
to return to the bureau.

349
00:19:06,362 --> 00:19:08,934
We can offer you full pension
and benefits.

350
00:19:14,725 --> 00:19:17,250
Are saying that you
want me to leave the B.A.U?

351
00:19:17,578 --> 00:19:20,405
Well, obviously that's your choice, but

352
00:19:20,969 --> 00:19:22,680
I'm offering you a way out.

353
00:19:24,222 --> 00:19:27,105
Agent Moan's promotion was temporary,

354
00:19:27,214 --> 00:19:29,206
but he's exceeded our expectations,

355
00:19:29,225 --> 00:19:31,799
and I'm confident
that I could make it permanent,

356
00:19:31,864 --> 00:19:33,980
if you decide to step down.

357
00:19:34,203 --> 00:19:37,789
The team would be together
and you could be with your son.

358
00:19:38,896 --> 00:19:41,147
And when would you like a decision?

359
00:19:42,018 --> 00:19:44,147
I thought I would be leavI with one.

360
00:19:44,214 --> 00:19:45,747
What's your hesitation?

361
00:19:45,814 --> 00:19:48,552
I would just like to weigh
all of my options.

362
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:50,826
Whatever you need.

363
00:19:53,811 --> 00:19:56,778
We believe our unsub is already
with his next victim.

364
00:19:56,844 --> 00:19:59,450
If he matches pattern,
she'll be a successful woman,

365
00:19:59,525 --> 00:20:02,333
probably brunette,
early 30s to mid-40s.

366
00:20:02,448 --> 00:20:05,496
She'll be at home
in Nashville's upper echelon.

367
00:20:05,534 --> 00:20:07,880
This *mea that he fits in.
Herives the right car,

368
00:20:07,947 --> 00:20:10,114
he wears the right clothes,
he's highly intelligent.

369
00:20:10,181 --> 00:20:12,414
He probably comes
from a place of status.

370
00:20:12,481 --> 00:20:14,847
This guy's sociable,
and he's endearing.

371
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:17,233
You would never suspect
that this man is capable of murder.

372
00:20:17,308 --> 00:20:18,735
But he will do whatever it takes

373
00:20:18,763 --> 00:20:20,735
to protect the fantasy
that he's trying to relive.

374
00:20:20,782 --> 00:20:23,747
It's this fantasy
which fuels his drive.

375
00:20:23,814 --> 00:20:25,814
He's recreating a romantic evening

376
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,014
and repeating it
with each of his victims.

377
00:20:28,081 --> 00:20:30,890
He most likely recently had
a relationship taken away from him.

378
00:20:30,927 --> 00:20:32,608
So look at men
who have lost loved ones

379
00:20:32,646 --> 00:20:34,280
or have gone through
a messy divorce.

380
00:20:34,298 --> 00:20:35,713
But like bundy,

381
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,018
these women are representations
of that first loss.

382
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:40,713
Bundy picked victims
who had similar features

383
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,303
to the woman that abandoned him,

384
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,847
and we believe that our unsub
is doing the exact same thing.

385
00:20:44,914 --> 00:20:48,214
These women were *cfident,
successful, and strong,

386
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:49,439
and they fought back.

387
00:20:49,486 --> 00:20:51,181
Which means he has the ability

388
00:20:51,247 --> 00:20:52,981
to overpower them fairly easily.

389
00:20:53,005 --> 00:20:54,647
He believes or fantasizes

390
00:20:54,713 --> 00:20:56,549
he's in a relationship
with these woman.

391
00:20:56,586 --> 00:20:59,281
No matter how fleeting
the initial interaction is,

392
00:20:59,356 --> 00:21:01,214
it's everything to him.

393
00:21:01,281 --> 00:21:02,482
An invitation.

394
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:04,970
Our technical analyst
has compiled a list of locations

395
00:21:05,017 --> 00:21:07,181
that the victims visited
prior to their death.

396
00:21:07,247 --> 00:21:09,284
These are high-class establishments.

397
00:21:09,341 --> 00:21:11,181
We're going to want
to visit the same places.

398
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,247
So, look for men
who fit the profile,

399
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:15,347
but also women who match
victimology.

400
00:21:15,414 --> 00:21:18,274
If somebody's been paying a little too
much attention to them, talk to them.

401
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:21,344
Get a read, then jot their name down
so that we can check them out.

402
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:22,499
All right, folks,

403
00:21:22,565 --> 00:21:24,677
pick up your canvassing
assignments and get to work.

404
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:25,775
Thank you.

405
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:36,780
The rain's supposed
to clear up today.

406
00:21:36,847 --> 00:21:39,247
It's gonna be in the high 50s.

407
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,430
What do you want to do today?

408
00:21:52,453 --> 00:21:55,711
There are a lot of good movies
pling at the green hills mall.

409
00:22:00,174 --> 00:22:02,314
You want to go see something?

410
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:09,051
Why don't we stay inside today?

411
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,145
Maybe watch a dvd.

412
00:22:14,573 --> 00:22:17,081
I want to go on a real date, Joe.

413
00:22:23,247 --> 00:22:24,459
I thought...

414
00:22:25,081 --> 00:22:27,214
after we made love last night,

415
00:22:27,281 --> 00:22:29,693
you'd realize
how much you mean to me.

416
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,037
Don't you trust me, Joe?

417
00:23:02,935 --> 00:23:03,940
Who's that?

418
00:23:04,066 --> 00:23:05,343
I have no idea.

419
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,568
Erika?

420
00:23:13,365 --> 00:23:14,713
Honey, it's me!

421
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:15,731
You home?

422
00:23:19,714 --> 00:23:21,451
Got a surprise for me, baby?

423
00:23:51,149 --> 00:23:51,966
Erika?

424
00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:54,079
Grant, help!

425
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,646
Why do you have a key?

426
00:24:04,478 --> 00:24:05,154
Run!

427
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:11,983
Get upstairs!
Go, go, go!

428
00:24:12,213 --> 00:24:13,713
Grant! Grant!

429
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:16,914
Why... do... you... have... a... key?!

430
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,325
No! Grant! No! No!

431
00:24:19,747 --> 00:24:21,980
No! Grant! No!

432
00:24:22,047 --> 00:24:23,470
Hey, Erika, sweetie...

433
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,451
Why did he have a key?

434
00:24:32,117 --> 00:24:33,845
Why did he have a key?

435
00:24:48,547 --> 00:24:50,780
House belongs to an Erika Silverman,

436
00:24:50,847 --> 00:24:52,947
project director in
an international design firm.

437
00:24:53,014 --> 00:24:55,787
We're assuming the male victim
is her boyfriend Grant Franklin.

438
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:56,751
Male victim?

439
00:24:56,752 --> 00:24:58,085
They're both pretty beat up.

440
00:24:58,104 --> 00:24:59,935
We'll need dental records
for a positive I.D.

441
00:24:59,954 --> 00:25:00,977
Who called it in?

442
00:25:01,005 --> 00:25:03,247
Ups guy. Needed her
to sign for a package,

443
00:25:03,314 --> 00:25:05,247
the door was wide open.
We got him out back.

444
00:25:05,314 --> 00:25:06,365
JJ, talk to him.

445
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,314
Where's Erika Silverman's body?

446
00:25:08,909 --> 00:25:10,414
He changed his M.O.

447
00:25:10,845 --> 00:25:13,314
Multiple stab wounds
to the face and neck.

448
00:25:13,562 --> 00:25:14,651
Classic overkill.

449
00:25:14,745 --> 00:25:17,014
And evidence that
she had sex before she died.

450
00:25:17,081 --> 00:25:18,544
Forced or consensual?

451
00:25:18,591 --> 00:25:20,448
No evidence of sexual assault.

452
00:25:21,237 --> 00:25:22,561
She played along.

453
00:25:23,459 --> 00:25:24,806
She had sex th the unsub

454
00:25:24,844 --> 00:25:26,750
because she thought
it would keep her alive.

455
00:25:26,814 --> 00:25:28,145
So why didn't it?

456
00:25:28,247 --> 00:25:30,441
This kill is personal, angry.

457
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,889
She didn't give him
everything that he wanted.

458
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,697
What else does he want?

459
00:25:40,675 --> 00:25:43,647
The dinner dishes are washed,
but the breakfast plates aren't.

460
00:25:44,123 --> 00:25:45,691
He didn't cln up this time.

461
00:25:45,757 --> 00:25:48,235
The boyfriend must have surprised
him and disrupted his routine.

462
00:25:48,256 --> 00:25:50,472
I don't know, I'd say he came
pretty close to finishing it.

463
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:52,876
It looks like they watched a movie,
had an early breakfast.

464
00:25:52,914 --> 00:25:54,369
She was with him all night.

465
00:25:57,165 --> 00:25:58,902
- Hey, Garcia.
- Bad news, buttercup.

466
00:25:59,043 --> 00:26:00,188
Great. What is it?

467
00:26:00,245 --> 00:26:02,320
No payoff on the social
networng sites,

468
00:26:02,386 --> 00:26:05,573
and this Erika Silverman person does
not leave a breadcrumb-like trail.

469
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:08,070
Aside from a couple
of online purchases

470
00:26:08,089 --> 00:26:11,257
and some automatic debits, she hasn't
used her credit card all week.

471
00:26:11,472 --> 00:26:12,936
All right. Thanks.

472
00:26:16,719 --> 00:26:19,160
So, Garcia couldn't find anything
about erika silverman's

473
00:26:19,235 --> 00:26:20,850
whereabouts over the past week.

474
00:26:20,907 --> 00:26:22,633
No stores, no restaurants, nothing.

475
00:26:22,698 --> 00:26:24,448
Thermay actually be another way

476
00:26:24,514 --> 00:26:25,953
to figure out where she's been.

477
00:26:25,991 --> 00:26:27,934
Do we know where any
of the victims' cars are?

478
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,548
As far as I know,
they're in impound.

479
00:26:29,613 --> 00:26:31,247
We need access to all 4 of them.

480
00:26:31,314 --> 00:26:31,928
4?

481
00:26:31,985 --> 00:26:33,722
We should also get
grant franklin's car.

482
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:36,704
He may have driven erika somewhere
where she met the unsub.

483
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,814
There has to be something
in the victimology.

484
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,847
If Grant Franklin hadn't
come home when he did,

485
00:26:47,914 --> 00:26:50,081
Erika would probably still be alive.

486
00:26:50,355 --> 00:26:52,347
So how did the unsub miss him?

487
00:26:52,414 --> 00:26:54,713
It says he was out of town last week

488
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,448
visiting family in Indianapolis.

489
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:59,815
Still, the violence of those kills
indicates he knew both victims.

490
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,381
'cause the longer victims
are with the killer,

491
00:27:02,448 --> 00:27:04,281
the more desperate the attack.

492
00:27:04,347 --> 00:27:07,880
The unsub stabbed Erika Silverman
17 times in the face,

493
00:27:07,947 --> 00:27:10,669
Grant Franklin 34 times
to the face and genitals.

494
00:27:10,735 --> 00:27:12,713
It makes sense.
The more he perfects his routine,

495
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,121
the more invested he becomes.

496
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,990
Detective Kaminski,
have your men had any luck

497
00:27:16,027 --> 00:27:17,952
canvassing the victims'
last known whereabouts?

498
00:27:18,046 --> 00:27:20,622
None. I'm thinking
of pulling them off for the night.

499
00:27:20,669 --> 00:27:21,740
That's a mistake.

500
00:27:21,796 --> 00:27:23,345
Why is that?
The vic's dead.

501
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:26,132
If he sticks to the pattern, we've got
another week before he strikes again.

502
00:27:26,181 --> 00:27:27,914
Because he's never
gotten this far before.

503
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,047
He's desperate to ay out
his fantasy.

504
00:27:30,114 --> 00:27:32,770
A man like this isn't gonna
stick to any timetable.

505
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,647
He's gonna try
to finish this tonight.

506
00:27:34,969 --> 00:27:36,747
JJ, we need you on the news.

507
00:27:36,814 --> 00:27:39,548
Narrow victimology. Let people
know that he's out there right now.

508
00:27:39,613 --> 00:27:40,495
I'm on it.

509
00:27:41,718 --> 00:27:43,947
We still don't know where
he's finding his victims.

510
00:27:44,014 --> 00:27:46,947
But we do know that Erika Silverman

511
00:27:47,014 --> 00:27:48,580
lived in green hills.

512
00:27:48,647 --> 00:27:50,481
That's 3 points and we finally have

513
00:27:50,548 --> 00:27:52,281
our geographical comfort zone.

514
00:27:52,347 --> 00:27:55,001
It's a good bet the unsub lis
somewhere in this area,

515
00:27:55,025 --> 00:27:57,874
and Erika is our key to figuring out
where they met.

516
00:27:59,875 --> 00:28:01,968
Oh, man, pancakes for dinner.

517
00:28:02,005 --> 00:28:03,395
Is there anything better?

518
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:04,584
No, ere's not.

519
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,350
Hey, Jack, who are these guys?

520
00:28:07,914 --> 00:28:10,644
This is you,
and this is the bad guy.

521
00:28:10,701 --> 00:28:11,937
They're fighting.

522
00:28:12,173 --> 00:28:13,366
Who wins, Jack?

523
00:28:13,613 --> 00:28:16,707
Daddy.
No one beats daddy.

524
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,164
Hey, Jack.

525
00:28:19,345 --> 00:28:21,114
Aunt Jessica's almost
got dinner ready.

526
00:28:21,181 --> 00:28:23,036
I forgot, what do we do
before we eat?

527
00:28:23,086 --> 00:28:24,288
Wash our hands.

528
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:25,293
Good job.

529
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:26,303
Come on.

530
00:28:27,425 --> 00:28:28,345
Daddy...

531
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:32,580
he built those himself.
I hope it's ok.

532
00:28:33,005 --> 00:28:33,982
Of course.

533
00:28:34,914 --> 00:28:37,081
Listen, I really appreciate
your coming over.

534
00:28:37,147 --> 00:28:40,181
All your help and support,
it's been great.

535
00:28:40,686 --> 00:28:42,947
He's my nephew,
and you're my family.

536
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:45,580
I'll be here as much as you want.

537
00:28:52,414 --> 00:28:54,880
The bureau has offered me
retirement.

538
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,698
What did you tell them?

539
00:28:59,544 --> 00:29:02,013
You know, Jack needs me now
more than ever.

540
00:29:02,804 --> 00:29:04,613
That means being here full-time.

541
00:29:05,351 --> 00:29:07,713
After Haley and I were apart,
he didn't havee very much,

542
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:11,045
and that was hard, buI knew that
at least he had his mom

543
00:29:12,481 --> 00:29:14,750
and right now
he really needs his dad.

544
00:29:15,114 --> 00:29:17,047
Of course he does, Aaron.

545
00:29:17,114 --> 00:29:18,850
We both know you and Haley
didn't separate

546
00:29:18,869 --> 00:29:20,548
beuse you stopped loving each other.

547
00:29:20,613 --> 00:29:22,281
Your job just got in the way.

548
00:29:22,581 --> 00:29:23,980
Your team needed you,

549
00:29:24,047 --> 00:29:27,047
and despite this offer,
I doubt that's changed.

550
00:29:27,389 --> 00:29:29,448
Maybe you don't need to retire.

551
00:29:30,283 --> 00:29:32,438
What if I stayed with Jack

552
00:29:33,409 --> 00:29:35,297
when you had to be away?

553
00:29:36,606 --> 00:29:38,249
Jessica, I appreciate that...

554
00:29:38,305 --> 00:29:39,320
please...

555
00:29:40,651 --> 00:29:44,078
it would mean a lot to me
if you'd let me help you out with Jack.

556
00:29:46,085 --> 00:29:47,043
For Haley.

557
00:29:55,665 --> 00:29:57,139
Garcia's got something.

558
00:29:57,773 --> 00:29:59,585
I'm a real genius
'cause this is what I di*

559
00:29:59,651 --> 00:30:01,698
I took the travel logs
from the GPS systems,

560
00:30:01,745 --> 00:30:03,989
overlaid their routes
agains the geographical profile

561
00:30:04,036 --> 00:30:06,247
to reveal what
the paper trail could not.

562
00:30:06,314 --> 00:30:07,185
Which was?

563
00:30:07,241 --> 00:30:09,114
While Erika Silverman
is the only victim

564
00:30:09,181 --> 00:30:11,343
who didn't visit a private club,
a concert,

565
00:30:11,381 --> 00:30:14,114
or go to a fancy restaurant in
the days leading upo* her death,

566
00:30:14,181 --> 00:30:15,713
she did spend a couple of hours

567
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,820
at cheekwood botanical gardens
on tuesday.

568
00:30:17,867 --> 00:30:20,481
Garcia, did either of the other
victims go to the park?

569
00:30:20,548 --> 00:30:21,163
No.

570
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:22,797
I don't know if it's relevant, then.

571
00:30:22,825 --> 00:30:25,520
It is when her navigation
system reads in a straight line.

572
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:27,281
To work, back home,
to work, back home.

573
00:30:27,347 --> 00:30:28,980
I don't think
she ever left her house.

574
00:30:29,047 --> 00:30:30,898
She even had her groceries
delivered.

575
00:30:31,485 --> 00:30:33,214
What washe doI on tuesday?

576
00:30:33,852 --> 00:30:35,186
Let's find out.

577
00:30:44,028 --> 00:30:45,709
Where is everybody?

578
00:30:46,691 --> 00:30:48,841
Well, JJ and Reid
are checking on a lead,

579
00:30:48,945 --> 00:30:51,824
and prentiss is recanvassing
with detective Kaminski.

580
00:30:52,347 --> 00:30:53,083
Good.

581
00:30:54,416 --> 00:30:55,778
Then wcan talk.

582
00:30:59,856 --> 00:31:00,747
Rossi...

583
00:31:02,942 --> 00:31:04,078
it's his team.

584
00:31:04,777 --> 00:31:06,702
I'm not gonna stand
in the way of that.

585
00:31:07,097 --> 00:31:08,647
It might not come to that.

586
00:31:08,911 --> 00:31:11,803
- What do you mean?
- Strauss offered him retirement.

587
00:31:16,161 --> 00:31:17,381
He'll never accept it.

588
00:31:17,448 --> 00:31:18,980
Don't be so sure.

589
00:31:19,194 --> 00:31:21,481
This job cost him his wife.

590
00:31:21,548 --> 00:31:23,081
It cost him that a long time ago.

591
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:26,247
Which is why he won't
let it cost him his son.

592
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:34,144
What do you think he'll do?

593
00:31:34,417 --> 00:31:36,114
It doesn't matter what I think.

594
00:31:36,652 --> 00:31:38,260
What matters is whether

595
00:31:38,335 --> 00:31:41,387
you'll be willing to step down
if he comes back.

596
00:31:41,676 --> 00:31:43,807
Or step up if he doesn't.

597
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:49,813
I'm gonna do whatever Hotch
needs me to do. He's lost enough.

598
00:31:55,775 --> 00:31:56,680
Hey, Rossi.

599
00:31:57,372 --> 00:32:01,141
You mind coming here for a second?
I want to throw something at you.

600
00:32:02,656 --> 00:32:05,314
We profiled that our unsub
recently experienced a loss as well.

601
00:32:05,767 --> 00:32:06,687
A loved one.

602
00:32:06,732 --> 00:32:09,314
Probably a brunette who ran
in the same circles as his victims.

603
00:32:09,379 --> 00:32:10,150
Right.

604
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:12,214
What if love wasn't the only loss?

605
00:32:13,035 --> 00:32:14,747
I mean, we assumed
that because our unsub

606
00:32:14,814 --> 00:32:16,980
could so easily navigate
our victims' upscale world

607
00:32:17,047 --> 00:32:19,980
that he most likely shared the same
financial resources as his victims.

608
00:32:20,413 --> 00:32:23,144
Because of his upbringing,
his sophisticated behavior.

609
00:32:23,238 --> 00:32:25,561
But that behavior
is ingrained in him.

610
00:32:25,847 --> 00:32:27,080
It's habit.

611
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:30,516
It something he would have
learned as a child, not as an adult.

612
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:33,381
If he didn't have
financial independence

613
00:32:33,448 --> 00:32:36,481
but were still trying
to keep up his social status,

614
00:32:36,548 --> 00:32:38,147
he'd be hemorrhaging funds.

615
00:32:38,214 --> 00:32:40,312
We've been looking at this
the wrong way, Rossi.

616
00:32:40,387 --> 00:32:42,503
We vetted the maids,
the gardeners, the pool cleaners,

617
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,548
anyone who had access to the houses,

618
00:32:44,613 --> 00:32:47,697
but who else might go unnoticed
in a privileged society?

619
00:32:48,636 --> 00:32:50,148
- Garcia here.
- Garcia,

620
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:53,680
check employee records at each of
the venues the victims visited

621
00:32:53,747 --> 00:32:55,548
in the week prior to their death.

622
00:32:55,613 --> 00:32:58,014
Look f men spending
beyond their means.

623
00:32:58,081 --> 00:33:00,247
A guy who's racked up
a lot of debt*, Garcia.

624
00:33:00,314 --> 00:33:01,880
Look at cars, wardrobes,

625
00:33:01,947 --> 00:33:04,184
something that does not fit
their current income level.

626
00:33:04,241 --> 00:33:07,114
A scholarship-funded
private school education maybe.

627
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:08,780
As you can see,

628
00:33:08,847 --> 00:33:11,047
the park attracts
a variety of patrons.

629
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,880
Older couples, walkers, tour groups.

630
00:33:13,947 --> 00:33:17,780
We'll hold an occasional wedding
or concert sers on our upper lawn.

631
00:33:17,847 --> 00:33:19,859
Did you have any events
here past tuesday?

632
00:33:19,953 --> 00:33:23,005
Tuesday.
We had a corporate fund-raiser

633
00:33:23,633 --> 00:33:25,192
between 4:00 and 7:00.

634
00:33:25,267 --> 00:33:27,507
That's when Erika Silverman was here.

635
00:33:27,601 --> 00:33:30,548
An event up here would be
a hard sell for women in heels

636
00:33:30,613 --> 00:33:32,814
well, most of our private
events hire valets

637
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,947
to drive the cars down
to the base of the park

638
00:33:35,014 --> 00:33:36,947
so they don't have
to hiket up the hill.

639
00:33:37,014 --> 00:33:39,598
Who has access to your keys
but goes unseen?

640
00:33:39,957 --> 00:33:41,347
And to your GPS.

641
00:33:41,414 --> 00:33:44,269
Dealerships program your home
address into the navigation system

642
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:46,119
before your car even leaves the lot.

643
00:33:46,203 --> 00:33:49,014
He had turn by turn directions
straight to her front door

644
00:33:49,081 --> 00:33:50,946
and the keys to get him inside.

645
00:33:59,747 --> 00:34:00,765
Thank you...

646
00:34:00,969 --> 00:34:01,664
Joe.

647
00:34:18,865 --> 00:34:20,959
Please state your desired destination.

648
00:34:20,978 --> 00:34:23,109
Take me home.

649
00:34:35,634 --> 00:34:39,953
Culpepper valet company handled
the fund-raiser on tuesday, and...

650
00:34:40,014 --> 00:34:41,647
the same company had contracts

651
00:34:41,713 --> 00:34:43,980
with the hotel lounge
thany *heminger frequented

652
00:34:44,047 --> 00:34:46,509
and the country club
Melissa Johnson was a member at.

653
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:47,706
That's our connection.

654
00:34:47,724 --> 00:34:49,630
JJ, get Rossi and Prentiss
to pick up the owner.

655
00:34:49,658 --> 00:34:50,674
Right away.

656
00:34:51,867 --> 00:34:53,660
All right, baby girl, talk to me.

657
00:34:53,735 --> 00:34:55,780
I need employee records
and a list of venues

658
00:34:55,847 --> 00:34:57,801
that culpepper contracted
out to this weekend.

659
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,945
Oh, sug, check your email.
It hit your inbox 60 seconds ago.

660
00:35:01,011 --> 00:35:02,570
Thanks, Penelope.

661
00:35:03,375 --> 00:35:05,214
All right, culpeer
contracted out to 3 venues

662
00:35:05,281 --> 00:35:07,114
this weekend, 2 today.

663
00:35:07,137 --> 00:35:08,952
We might be able to catch
this guy in action.

664
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,970
Unless he's already
with another victim.

665
00:35:11,789 --> 00:35:13,156
The man we're looking for

666
00:35:13,231 --> 00:35:16,147
would have been assigned
to cheekwood park on tuesday.

667
00:35:17,196 --> 00:35:19,548
Hold on, let me,
pull the roster.

668
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:25,214
Ok, we had 6 guys
at tt site on that day.

669
00:35:25,471 --> 00:35:28,647
He would have had very few
if any disciplinary citings.

670
00:35:28,713 --> 00:35:32,328
He's proper. He appears to have had
a gentlemanly upbringing.

671
00:35:32,432 --> 00:35:35,268
He's a romantic.
He would have talked about women

672
00:35:35,353 --> 00:35:36,815
and love frequently.

673
00:35:36,918 --> 00:35:39,259
He might have just ended
a long-term relationship

674
00:35:39,325 --> 00:35:40,993
or lost someone close to him.

675
00:35:41,059 --> 00:35:42,847
Belser.
Joe Belser.

676
00:35:43,183 --> 00:35:44,695
Him and his girl, they broke up.

677
00:35:44,732 --> 00:35:45,947
When was tt?

678
00:35:46,362 --> 00:35:47,947
A few weeks ago.
They were engaged.

679
00:35:47,985 --> 00:35:49,214
Do you know what hapned?

680
00:35:49,281 --> 00:35:51,384
He was head over heels
inove with her.

681
00:35:52,014 --> 00:35:54,214
And she was sleeping
with the best man.

682
00:35:56,877 --> 00:35:58,793
The manager said belser
picked up a shift

683
00:35:58,896 --> 00:36:00,882
at the vonner street lounge.

684
00:36:01,281 --> 00:36:02,986
Yeah, we're headed there right now.

685
00:36:03,051 --> 00:36:05,171
Ok. SWAT's gonna meet us
at belser's apartment.

686
00:36:05,209 --> 00:36:07,147
Garcia, did you find
anything else on Belser?

687
00:36:07,214 --> 00:36:10,381
Ok. He attended southern
Charleston preparatory academy

688
00:36:10,448 --> 00:36:13,014
on scholarship his parents died
in a boating accident

689
00:36:13,081 --> 00:36:14,181
6 years ago.

690
00:36:14,247 --> 00:36:16,914
Belser lost his inheritance
in the stock market,

691
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,014
and since then,
he has been racking up debt

692
00:36:19,081 --> 00:36:20,872
faster than he can pay it off.

693
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:24,769
He was engaged to society
magazine editor Rose Smith

694
00:36:25,229 --> 00:36:26,880
until 6 weeks ago...

695
00:36:27,731 --> 00:36:29,255
when it was called off.

696
00:36:29,293 --> 00:36:31,539
And the chapel was already paid for.

697
00:36:31,745 --> 00:36:35,097
So he spent his entire savings trying
to live in the world of his fiancee.

698
00:36:35,144 --> 00:36:37,717
She was his lifeline
the society he'd grown up in.

699
00:36:37,742 --> 00:36:39,799
Only to have her leave him
and wind up penniless.

700
00:36:39,846 --> 00:36:42,831
Hey, Garcia, I don't suppose belser's
car has a lo-Jack system on it,

701
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:43,740
does it no.

702
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:45,147
No such luck, boy wonder.

703
00:36:45,214 --> 00:36:47,042
Need potential victims' names.

704
00:36:47,117 --> 00:36:48,780
- We'll get back to you.
- Ok.

705
00:36:51,866 --> 00:36:52,937
FBI! Open up!

706
00:36:53,031 --> 00:36:54,283
Joe Belser, FBI!

707
00:36:54,349 --> 00:36:56,289
If you're in there,
identify yourself!

708
00:37:02,547 --> 00:37:04,209
- It's clear here.
- Clear.

709
00:37:05,871 --> 00:37:08,676
I think I found the meaning
of the rose petals.

710
00:37:08,845 --> 00:37:09,814
Look at these.

711
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,478
Garage door openers?

712
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:13,605
Universal garage door eners.

713
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:18,519
This solves the problem
of having to copy the key.

714
00:37:18,607 --> 00:37:20,667
Some drivers are smart
enough to use a valet key,

715
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:22,930
but no one thinks to take
a garage door opener with them.

716
00:37:22,996 --> 00:37:24,980
That's how he got into
Melissa Johnson's house.

717
00:37:25,008 --> 00:37:27,385
We only found ints
on the interior garage door.

718
00:37:27,407 --> 00:37:30,034
We thought it was from he moved
the dog into the garage.

719
00:37:30,128 --> 00:37:31,800
People rarely think to lock a door

720
00:37:31,866 --> 00:37:34,014
that lies beyond anothelocked door.

721
00:37:34,661 --> 00:37:36,481
Reid. He's not here.

722
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:42,862
A beautiful brunette,
late 30s, early 40s.

723
00:37:42,947 --> 00:37:45,942
She would have been driving
a high-class SUV or Sedan.

724
00:37:46,073 --> 00:37:47,910
She only buys high-end.

725
00:37:48,455 --> 00:37:49,122
No?

726
00:37:49,656 --> 00:37:50,607
Thank you.

727
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,345
- Vip?
- Definitely.

728
00:37:53,836 --> 00:37:56,118
Let me check the register logs.

729
00:37:56,671 --> 00:37:58,493
This is a list
of all of our customers

730
00:37:58,671 --> 00:38:00,680
who made charges
in our vip section tonight.

731
00:38:01,595 --> 00:38:03,139
They have their own attendant.

732
00:38:03,158 --> 00:38:05,489
15 names.
Only 6 were women.

733
00:38:05,526 --> 00:38:07,122
- Garcia, we need you.
- Whatcha got?

734
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,651
All right, 6 names used credit cards

735
00:38:08,688 --> 00:38:10,603
at the vonner street lounge
in the past 3 hours.

736
00:38:10,659 --> 00:38:13,780
Jennifer Ketelson, Kiegan Murphy,
Heather Aldridge, Meg Natraj,

737
00:38:13,847 --> 00:38:15,814
Ann Herron, and Katie Gotshall.

738
00:38:16,552 --> 00:38:19,347
Ok, I'm cross-referencing
the geographical profile

739
00:38:19,414 --> 00:38:20,986
with financial records.

740
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:23,728
These 3 look good,
and one a brunette.

741
00:38:23,854 --> 00:38:25,214
Her name is Ann Herron.

742
00:38:25,281 --> 00:38:27,519
She lives at 431 Pyle Street.

743
00:38:28,016 --> 00:38:29,129
We got him.

744
00:38:35,316 --> 00:38:36,406
Sweetheart.

745
00:38:46,113 --> 00:38:47,512
Stop! No!

746
00:38:48,402 --> 00:38:50,533
No, no!

747
00:38:50,739 --> 00:38:52,921
We are going to be happy together.

748
00:38:53,003 --> 00:38:53,647
No!

749
00:38:56,885 --> 00:38:58,914
Don't you want this to work out?

750
00:39:01,428 --> 00:39:02,704
Answer me!

751
00:39:02,789 --> 00:39:03,680
No!

752
00:39:04,505 --> 00:39:05,739
Annie!

753
00:39:05,814 --> 00:39:08,435
I'm trying to make this
a magical night!

754
00:39:08,557 --> 00:39:09,474
No!

755
00:39:09,615 --> 00:39:11,080
No! No!

756
00:39:17,756 --> 00:39:19,613
You ruined ts!

757
00:39:22,033 --> 00:39:23,902
FBI! Put it down!

758
00:39:27,188 --> 00:39:29,056
It's ok.
You're gonna be ok.

759
00:39:29,549 --> 00:39:30,847
Fantasy's over.

760
00:39:31,237 --> 00:39:32,882
Is that what you did to them?

761
00:39:32,901 --> 00:39:34,381
You hit them to shut them up

762
00:39:34,448 --> 00:39:37,532
and then forced them to play along
with your sick delusion?

763
00:39:38,321 --> 00:39:39,448
I love them.

764
00:39:41,539 --> 00:39:43,871
You're finally gonna
meet your soul mate, Joe.

765
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:44,980
In prison.

766
00:39:45,563 --> 00:39:47,560
Only you'r not gonna
be able to push him around

767
00:39:47,588 --> 00:39:49,014
the way you did thoswomen.

768
00:39:49,582 --> 00:39:51,680
And when he comes for you

769
00:39:52,171 --> 00:39:53,780
in the middle of the night,

770
00:39:54,182 --> 00:39:55,840
when you're least expecting it,

771
00:39:55,915 --> 00:39:57,388
you do me a favor.

772
00:39:58,233 --> 00:39:59,407
Play along.

773
00:40:11,098 --> 00:40:12,114
How is she?

774
00:40:12,802 --> 00:40:15,051
She's strong.
She'll make it.

775
00:40:15,248 --> 00:40:18,247
But you don't survive
something like that without scars.

776
00:40:18,739 --> 00:40:20,780
Scars remind us where we've been.

777
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:24,167
They don't have to dictate
where we're going.

778
00:41:00,931 --> 00:41:02,914
I had a feeling I'd find you here.

779
00:41:08,954 --> 00:41:10,713
Have you told her yet?

780
00:41:11,988 --> 00:41:13,047
Lder* what?

781
00:41:16,616 --> 00:41:19,020
That you're coming back to the team.

782
00:41:20,222 --> 00:41:23,527
That fighting the bad guys
is who you are.

783
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,020
I don't have to tell her.

784
00:41:33,012 --> 00:41:34,608
She already knows.

785
00:41:46,803 --> 00:41:49,667
What lies behind us
and at lies before us

786
00:41:49,733 --> 00:41:53,094
are tiny matters compared
*wt lies within us.

787
00:41:54,085 --> 00:41:55,596
Ralph Waldo Emerson.

788
00:41:57,728 --> 00:42:08,000
