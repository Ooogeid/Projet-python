1
00:00:01,522 --> 00:00:05,305
<i>We appeal to him,
do not hurt any more people.</i>

2
00:00:05,548 --> 00:00:08,214
He killed those people
because of something I said.

3
00:00:08,384 --> 00:00:10,885
That's part of the job.
Tell me now if you can do it or not.

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:17,995
Jordan?

5
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,042
He just killed his entire family.

6
00:00:21,843 --> 00:00:23,356
Is this my fault?

7
00:00:23,722 --> 00:00:24,726
No way.

8
00:00:25,297 --> 00:00:27,113
I'm not sure I can do this job.

9
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,653
It's up there, on the right.

10
00:00:51,042 --> 00:00:52,773
Come on, son, it's time.

11
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,645
I know you're awake.

12
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,245
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

13
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:02,894
There's something on your mind.
Tell us what it is.

14
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,490
What if she doesn't like me?

15
00:01:08,194 --> 00:01:09,612
Let her get to know you.

16
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:11,482
There's no rush.

17
00:01:12,071 --> 00:01:15,120
Is that really
what you're worried about?

18
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,425
Do I have to meet her this way?

19
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,403
We've been talking about
this moment your whole life.

20
00:01:20,601 --> 00:01:22,746
- I know.
- Baby, look at me.

21
00:01:23,593 --> 00:01:24,882
You're almost 10.

22
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:26,951
You're becoming a man.

23
00:01:28,029 --> 00:01:29,004
I love you.

24
00:01:30,073 --> 00:01:31,326
I love you, too.

25
00:01:46,034 --> 00:01:47,231
Come on.

26
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,626
- What was it?
- Excuse me.

27
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,999
This isn't good.

28
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:51,415
A request from Alabama.

29
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,485
I'll be there in 10 min.

30
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,035
A couple was murdered at their home
while they were sleeping.

31
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,092
- Their daughter went missing.
- I gotta call you back.

32
00:02:59,217 --> 00:03:01,180
- When were they discovered?
- Less than an hour.

33
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,474
- Time of death?
- Approximately 1 A.M.

34
00:03:03,643 --> 00:03:05,184
- 8 h.
- This isn't a serial.

35
00:03:05,309 --> 00:03:08,759
You're right. Most abducted children
don't survive past the first 24 hours.

36
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,725
What's going on?

37
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:16,743
A missing little girl, home invasion.
Parents were killed in their sleep.

38
00:03:16,868 --> 00:03:18,367
- Where's our clock?
- 8 h.

39
00:03:18,492 --> 00:03:21,720
- I tell Morgan and Reid we move.
- Good. Wheels-up in 30.

40
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:24,787
You need your go bag.

41
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,504
Right. Right.

42
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:48,353
Please let me go. Let me go.
I won't tell. Please.

43
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:54,690
It's OK.

44
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,560
We talked about this.

45
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:06,161
- Are you... are you thirsty?
- Please don't hurt me.

46
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,454
It's only water.

47
00:04:24,232 --> 00:04:25,306
Can I decide now?

48
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:27,933
It's up to you.

49
00:04:29,513 --> 00:04:30,969
I'm gonna call you...

50
00:04:31,775 --> 00:04:32,877
Elena.

- Criminal Minds -
Season 04 Episode 13 Bloodline

54
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,396
Winston Churchill said,

55
00:05:07,934 --> 00:05:10,845
"There is no doubt that it is around
the family and the home

56
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,087
"that all the greatest virtues
of human society

57
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:16,021
"are created, strengthened,
and maintained."

58
00:05:18,059 --> 00:05:21,070
We got the uplinks of
the crime scene photos.

59
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,435
This is Geoff and Nancy Hale.
Both their throats were cut.

60
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,160
- Any evidence of abuse?
- Nothing.

61
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,665
Slitting someone's throat
is quick and efficient.

62
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,164
That's because the real target
was down the hall.

63
00:05:34,504 --> 00:05:35,975
- She has a name.
- What?

64
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,545
She's not "the target".
Her name's Cate.

65
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:40,060
She's 10 years old.

66
00:05:42,093 --> 00:05:43,173
All right.

67
00:05:44,387 --> 00:05:45,969
Amber alert in effect?

68
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:47,555
Since 7 A. M. this morning.

69
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,391
With the unsub's head start he could be
anywhere within a 400-mile radius.

70
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,679
Make sure that they're casting
a wide enough net.

71
00:05:52,804 --> 00:05:56,215
- Who discovered the bodies?
- Jim Scheuren, Cate's father.

72
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,149
He had to take her for the weekend.
The police don't consider him a suspect.

73
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:00,914
We'll want to talk to him anyway.

74
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,630
We need a list of registered
sex offenders in a 20-mile radius.

75
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:08,575
- What's the makeup of the neighborhood?
- Mostly white and middle class.

76
00:06:08,885 --> 00:06:10,278
We'll need aerial views.

77
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,715
If Madison county doesn't have them,
talk to Garcia.

78
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,373
Dave and Morgan, go to the crime scene.
We'll get up to speed at the precinct.

79
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,085
Bo Whitaker.

80
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,730
- David Rossi.
- I recognize you from the TV.

81
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,705
- Derek Morgan.
- Bo Whitaker. Pleased to meet you.

82
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,725
Point of entry's around back.

83
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,995
Now, the neighbors
didn't see or hear anything.

84
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,585
And the dogs lost the scent
almost immediately.

85
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,515
Not hard to target
a family out here.

86
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,225
Even in broad daylight.

87
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:55,316
Walk 5 feet off the track,
man could get lost for days.

88
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:59,562
So, he had plenty of privacy
to watch what he was really after.

89
00:07:07,955 --> 00:07:09,391
I prefer cities.

90
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,703
You can see them coming.

91
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,669
Nothing very sophisticated.

92
00:07:21,043 --> 00:07:23,836
Knocked off the pane
to unlock the door.

93
00:07:26,043 --> 00:07:29,298
- Do you think the girl's dead?
- Depends on what he took her for.

94
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:34,215
The Hales' neighborhood is a series
of rural roads and one-block streets.

95
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,685
- How far to a main thoroughfare?
- A little over 3 miles.

96
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:39,765
So he didn't come upon
Cate by accident. Sheriff Bates.

97
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:42,105
- Is Cate's father here yet?
- He's on his way.

98
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:45,380
- Let me know the second he gets here.
- We already checked out his alibi.

99
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,249
- He's not good for this.
- I know, but he might know who is.

100
00:07:48,374 --> 00:07:49,346
All right.

101
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,401
Is that the autopsy report?

102
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:09,363
- Listen, about the plane...
- That's already forgotten.

103
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,662
- Find anything in Cate's room?
- That's what's weird.

104
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,040
No sign of struggle. It didn't look like
she tried to get out of bed in a hurry.

105
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:23,335
Her parents' throats were cut.
If there was the element of surprise,

106
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,547
- they didn't have time to scream.
- Both of them?

107
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:29,674
- What are you looking for?
- The neck wounds...

108
00:08:29,844 --> 00:08:30,875
Something's off.

109
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:34,165
I'm the unsub.
I kill Geoff Hale first.

110
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:35,935
He presents the biggest threat.

111
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:40,046
But how do I do that without waking
Nancy who's sleeping right next to him?

112
00:08:40,171 --> 00:08:42,145
No ligature marks.
Neither one was tied down.

113
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,063
And no defensive wounds, either.

114
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,832
Geoff Hale, cause of death
was a single deep, smooth cut

115
00:08:46,957 --> 00:08:49,745
- that severed the carotid artery.
- And Nancy?

116
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,595
Nancy Hale, death was caused
by a series of jagged,

117
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,992
shallow wounds that
punctured the carotid artery.

118
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:58,255
- There's more than one unsub.
- You're sure?

119
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,145
He was either able to restrain Nancy
while he killed Geoff,

120
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,125
or she woke up,
and she would have screamed.

121
00:09:03,294 --> 00:09:05,084
At which point,
Cate would have woken up.

122
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:09,075
- We're looking at multiple unsubs.
- So things are worse than we thought.

123
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,266
Yes and no.

124
00:09:10,391 --> 00:09:12,316
Cate's chances of survival
just got better.

125
00:09:12,441 --> 00:09:14,887
- How do you figure?
- Two unsubs change the dynamics.

126
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,931
- What do you mean, dynamics?
- They spent more time with her.

127
00:09:20,444 --> 00:09:23,535
Yeah, Prentiss has the same theory
based on the autopsy report.

128
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,945
We're about to speak to Cate's father.
Stay at the scene.

129
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,885
- I'll call you back.
- Dad's in there.

130
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,465
Sheriff, alert your men.
We may be looking at a team.

131
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:32,048
I'll get it on the wire.

132
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,989
- How's the father?
- Between you and me,

133
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:38,182
I've cleaned up bar fights smell
better than he does right now.

134
00:09:43,802 --> 00:09:47,685
Mr. Scheuren. I'm Aaron hochner.
I'm with the FBI.

135
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,696
Can I get you anything? Coffee?

136
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,674
No, no. I can answer your questions.

137
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,285
Do you know if your ex-wife
and her husband have any enemies?

138
00:09:58,084 --> 00:10:01,255
I mean, I don't know.
I don't... I don't know. I...

139
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,102
What about Cate? Has she talked
about anyone new in her life?

140
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,575
She's a normal kid, you know?
She... meets people all the time.

141
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,965
This would be an adult,
possibly a white male.

142
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:13,365
He might be an authority
figure to her.

143
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:16,785
The reason that I ask is that given
the location of your ex-wife's house,

144
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:19,738
we think someone has targeted
Cate specifically.

145
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,475
Sorry.

146
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,626
Is there anything that you
can think of that might be helpful?

147
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,228
We like to go to the movies.

148
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:35,437
There's a new multiplex at the mall.

149
00:10:36,446 --> 00:10:37,844
How often do you see Cate?

150
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:42,391
- I have visitation every 2 weeks.
- Do you keep to that schedule?

151
00:10:43,255 --> 00:10:45,915
The reason that I ask is that
right now time is of the essence.

152
00:10:46,105 --> 00:10:48,543
- What's that supposed to mean?
- With all due respect, sir,

153
00:10:48,668 --> 00:10:50,777
it means that if you can't add
to my knowledge of Cate,

154
00:10:50,902 --> 00:10:52,814
my time is better
spent somewhere else.

155
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,290
I'll keep you posted
with any developments.

156
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,201
- Agent...
- Yes?

157
00:10:58,368 --> 00:10:59,699
There's one thing...

158
00:10:59,824 --> 00:11:01,940
Hold on a second.
I'm right here.

159
00:11:05,421 --> 00:11:06,455
Hotch, I got it.

160
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:09,305
OK, bring it with you when you
come to the station. Thanks.

161
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:11,662
- What's going on?
- Cate Hale has epilepsy,

162
00:11:11,787 --> 00:11:14,555
and whoever abducted her
didn't know to take the medicine.

163
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,053
And the primary cause
of seizures is stress.

164
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,565
- Remember what I said.
- I know, Dad.

165
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:30,545
Just concentrate. He shouldn't
even realize you're there.

166
00:11:30,813 --> 00:11:31,810
I know.

167
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,442
Go ahead.

168
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,865
Chin up. This isn't
something you learn overnight.

169
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,325
I'm ready now.

170
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:45,945
You need to master it here first.

171
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,414
Now try it again.

172
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,505
- No, no! Don't touch her.
- What's wrong with her?

173
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,035
- Can you hear me?
- Don't go near her.

174
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,344
- She's sick.
- She's no good.

175
00:12:00,605 --> 00:12:01,845
We have to do something.

176
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,210
You're right.

177
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:11,313
We don't kill young girls.

178
00:12:12,266 --> 00:12:13,643
This is my family.

179
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,593
Then you kill her.

180
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:45,240
Help!

181
00:13:45,596 --> 00:13:47,701
Help! Somebody!

182
00:13:58,415 --> 00:14:01,885
Her father's with her. She's been in and
out of consciousness, but she's stable.

183
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,908
- Sexual assault?
- We haven't tested yet.

184
00:14:04,033 --> 00:14:06,695
- We want to give her time to process.
- May we speak with her?

185
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,675
You should know, seizures often
come with retrograde amnesia.

186
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,025
She might have holes in her memory.

187
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,645
- Prentiss, you should do this alone.
- OK.

188
00:14:18,751 --> 00:14:19,814
Thanks, sheriff.

189
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:23,019
Mr. Scheuren, hello.

190
00:14:23,695 --> 00:14:25,655
I'm agent Emily Prentiss
from the FBI.

191
00:14:26,027 --> 00:14:28,348
I would like permission
to speak with your daughter.

192
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,795
I'm sorry, I'd like to do it
alone if possible.

193
00:14:33,076 --> 00:14:36,291
- Why?
- I need to ask her certain questions,

194
00:14:36,886 --> 00:14:40,415
and sometimes it's easier for a girl
to answer those questions

195
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,739
- when there are no men present.
- I'm her father.

196
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,550
Please?

197
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,703
All right, baby.

198
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,073
I'll be right outside.

199
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:53,980
Thank you.

200
00:14:58,099 --> 00:14:59,550
My name's Emily.

201
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,192
I'm so sorry about
your mom and your stepdad.

202
00:15:04,577 --> 00:15:06,297
I'd like to ask you some questions

203
00:15:06,422 --> 00:15:09,401
so we can find out
who did this, is that OK?

204
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,120
Yeah, it's OK.

205
00:15:12,239 --> 00:15:15,622
The doctor told me that if they
hadn't been alerted to her epilepsy,

206
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,667
she might not have made it.
You helped save her life.

207
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,379
You seen this kind of thing before?

208
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,715
- Unfortunately.
- And kids come out of it OK?

209
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,524
It'll take time.

210
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:30,745
And patience.
She's going to need you.

211
00:15:31,354 --> 00:15:35,100
Yesterday would have been the first
time I'd seen her in a month and a half.

212
00:15:38,309 --> 00:15:39,820
A colleague of mine asked me

213
00:15:39,945 --> 00:15:42,231
how my son was enjoying
the Christmas present he got for him,

214
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,859
and I had to make up an
answer because I didn't know.

215
00:15:49,151 --> 00:15:51,196
I think I'll get
that cup of coffee now.

216
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,645
The police sent the blanket
and Cate's clothing to be processed.

217
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:57,835
Good.

218
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:02,845
- <i>Garcia.</i>
- Captain, my captain.

219
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,588
<i>I need a list of crimes involving</i>

220
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:08,132
partners within a 90-mile radius
of Harvest in the last 2 years.

221
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,468
- All crimes?
- Anything. Violent crimes,

222
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:13,595
break-ins, whatever's in the system.
I need to show Cate some mugshots.

223
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,182
You got it. One scumbag
yearbook coming up.

224
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,165
So you think they're local?

225
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,353
They dumped Cate 84 miles
from her home.

226
00:16:20,567 --> 00:16:23,205
The sheriff who found her didn't
think that she'd been there long.

227
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,694
With the unsubs' head start,
they should have been long gone.

228
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:27,401
So we're zeroing in on them.

229
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,805
- Possibly.
- Then what's wrong?

230
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,741
I don't know why
they left her alive.

231
00:16:33,014 --> 00:16:36,515
I'm going to do what's
called a cognitive interview.

232
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,373
It's as much about the things
you sensed as the things you saw.

233
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,965
I'm scared.

234
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:43,793
I know. That's OK.

235
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:47,145
I'm right here with you.
I'm here all the way.

236
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:51,000
Now, I need you to close your eyes.

237
00:16:53,753 --> 00:16:56,514
What is the first thing
you remember?

238
00:17:01,102 --> 00:17:02,102
It's cold.

239
00:17:06,947 --> 00:17:08,087
<i>You're outside?</i>

240
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:10,445
<i>Who's there?</i>

241
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:12,447
A man. He told me to... 

242
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:13,531
Keep quiet.

243
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,965
- <i>What is he doing?</i>
- He's holding my hand. It hurts.

244
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:17,452
He's waiting for something.

245
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:20,205
- What does he look like?
- I don't want to be here.

246
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,505
He can't hurt you,
I promise. I'm right here.

247
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:25,126
Tall. Dark hair. Old.

248
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:28,463
- Old? Old like me?
- Old like my dad.

249
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,685
Is anyone else there?

250
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,841
Someone's coming! Emily!

251
00:17:34,452 --> 00:17:36,005
Emily, help me!

252
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,025
- Open the trunk!
- Help me!

253
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,933
OK, it's OK. I'm right here.

254
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,217
I promise you he cannot hurt you.

255
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:44,553
It's OK.

256
00:17:45,024 --> 00:17:46,061
It's OK.

257
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,859
So he put you
in the trunk of the car?

258
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:52,234
Open the trunk!

259
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,471
- How long were you in there?
- I don't know. Not long.

260
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,175
<i>10 minutes.</i>

261
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:08,220
<i>Was the ride bumpy or smooth?</i>

262
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:09,925
<i>It was smooth.</i>

263
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,506
<i>I wanted to scream,</i>

264
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:13,913
- but no sound would come out.
- It's OK.

265
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,957
So the car stops,
and they open the trunk.

266
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:19,390
<i>What do you hear?</i>

267
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,585
Wind. Wind through the trees.

268
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,310
And what do you smell?

269
00:18:24,505 --> 00:18:25,587
<i>Cooking.</i>

270
00:18:26,544 --> 00:18:29,441
- Are you inside now?
- They've taken my shoes off.

271
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,234
That's so you won't run.

272
00:18:31,638 --> 00:18:33,956
I want you to look down at your feet

273
00:18:34,081 --> 00:18:36,106
and tell me what you're standing on.

274
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,749
Carpet.

275
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:40,827
I'm in a little room.

276
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,787
With clothes and tinfoil
all around me.

277
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:44,873
What else?

278
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,694
- I... I hear bells.
- What kind of bells?

279
00:18:49,382 --> 00:18:51,566
Small. Like a fairy.

280
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:54,841
Every time they ring,
the man says something to the boy.

281
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:56,670
The boy?

282
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,390
He's standing right next to you.

283
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,848
How old is he?

284
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,123
I'm 9. Almost 10.

285
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,226
<i>Puyule</i>, come here.

286
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:11,566
- His parents want me to play with him.
- His parents?

287
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,778
Emily, I don't want to go.
I don't want to go. No!

288
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,155
Don't make me go!
Emily, no!

289
00:19:19,114 --> 00:19:20,575
It's OK, I'm right here.

290
00:19:21,061 --> 00:19:22,399
It's OK. It's OK.

291
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,483
Cate, open your eyes.

292
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:30,251
You did a really good job.

293
00:19:35,197 --> 00:19:39,020
Mr. Scheuren, you have
an incredibly strong little girl.

294
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:43,165
- Did he touch her?
- No, no. Not in that way, no.

295
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:44,296
Thank God.

296
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,882
She was taken by a family.

297
00:19:50,612 --> 00:19:51,455
A family?

298
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:54,145
Parents and a little boy
about her age.

299
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:57,395
They took her from her house
in a car and then into an RV.

300
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,105
A short ride on a road
and then into a wooded area.

301
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,295
Anything else?

302
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,956
She said the mother
called the boy <i>puyule</i>,

303
00:20:04,081 --> 00:20:06,585
which I think is a Romanian term
of endearment.

304
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:09,475
I know I used to hear it
when my mom was posted overseas.

305
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:12,265
Get Rossi and Morgan
on the closest RV parks.

306
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:13,990
What are we looking at here?

307
00:20:14,532 --> 00:20:15,758
I have no idea.

308
00:20:18,382 --> 00:20:21,255
Most people pay in cash. We don't have
much in the way of records.

309
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:24,045
Ma'am, this was a family...
mother, father, small boy.

310
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:26,265
They would have kept to
themselves and left abruptly.

311
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:28,425
You just described
most of my business.

312
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,525
The son wouldn't have
mingled with other children.

313
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:33,175
He would have been tightly
guarded by his parents.

314
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,585
Sorry. I wish I could help.

315
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:38,376
The family we're talking
about is Eastern European.

316
00:20:38,501 --> 00:20:40,605
They may have spoken some
foreign words to each other.

317
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:43,635
- They're in some kind of trouble?
- You remember them.

318
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,875
You can imagine I don't get a lot
of people speaking foreign around here.

319
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,580
What can you tell us about them?

320
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:50,745
Not much. The husband
was real businesslike.

321
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:53,755
Wife was nice, pretty.
Son was quiet.

322
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,385
A license or a credit card?

323
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:58,670
Left in the night and never came back.
I wouldn't have thought twice about it

324
00:20:58,795 --> 00:21:01,641
it if I didn't have to clean up
the campsite from all the glass.

325
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,687
Glass?

326
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,875
All over the ground.
Almost like they did it on purpose.

327
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,831
Can you show us where they parked?

328
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:16,335
I told you, you're
not gonna find nothin'.

329
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,578
I cleaned it up.

330
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,849
Well, thank you.

331
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:27,204
Jordan was right,
you know, on the plane.

332
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:32,205
- What are you talking about?
- We hide behind language.

333
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:35,205
We don't talk about
the ugliness we see.

334
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:36,715
We talk about it every day.

335
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,435
No. We talk facts.
Signature, m.o, pathology.

336
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,758
What are you getting at?

337
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:45,295
We're working a case where a family
is grooming their son to kill.

338
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:49,248
They're not murdering people. They're
stealing children, poisoning minds.

339
00:21:49,668 --> 00:21:50,725
Where's the horror?

340
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,936
We can't do this job
if we let it get to us.

341
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,687
Exactly.

342
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:08,974
Is it a match?

343
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,445
Which means the RV park owner was right.
They spread it on purpose.

344
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:16,165
So everything they do
is part of some ritual.

345
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:18,225
Have you ever seen
anything like this before?

346
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:20,555
A family that ritualizes
killing together? Definitely not.

347
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:24,175
You know, if the family speaks Romanian,
the spreading of the glass makes sense.

348
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:26,385
It's an eastern European
superstition for good luck.

349
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:29,095
- They're Romanian. We knew that.
- Not just Romanian.

350
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,662
We're talking about people that are
superstitious and obsessed with ritual.

351
00:22:32,787 --> 00:22:33,601
Romany.

352
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:34,936
- Romany?
- Gypsies.

353
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:37,605
More accurately, someone who
has perverted Romany culture.

354
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,317
Call Garcia. They're tight-knit
and nomadic like our unsubs,

355
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:44,215
- but not usually prone to violence.
- <i>Hiya, baby.</i>

356
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:47,435
- Hey, baby girl, we need to talk.
- Pg or nc-17?

357
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:50,826
- You're on speaker phone.
- <i>I charge extra for groups</i>.

358
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:54,955
Run through crimes similar
to the Hale murders in the last 2 years.

359
00:22:55,168 --> 00:22:57,915
- I already did that. Zip.
- <i>Go back even further, Garcia</i>.

360
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:00,982
Cross-reference against any small towns
that have had reports of petty theft

361
00:23:01,107 --> 00:23:04,257
associated with waves of Romany
populations entering the area.

362
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:05,745
- <i>Romany?</i>
- Gypsies.

363
00:23:05,927 --> 00:23:08,415
- As in "gypsies, tramps, and thieves"?
- Exactly.

364
00:23:08,638 --> 00:23:10,658
Bless you all for turning
my life into a Cher song.

365
00:23:10,783 --> 00:23:13,474
- You'll have it nearly immediately.
- You're the best.

366
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,483
You need to get your
men together right now.

367
00:23:15,608 --> 00:23:16,411
Why?

368
00:23:16,536 --> 00:23:18,771
'Cause whatever ritual these
people are trying to play out,

369
00:23:18,896 --> 00:23:21,095
we know Cate Hale
didn't fit their needs.

370
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,984
Which means
they'll have to try again.

371
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,926
- It's too soon.
- He turns 10 in a week.

372
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:50,887
It's not safe.

373
00:23:54,289 --> 00:23:55,981
You see one you like?

374
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,214
She's a fine choice.

375
00:24:15,903 --> 00:24:17,872
The unsubs we're looking for
are a family.

376
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:21,345
A father, a mother, and a son,
approximately 10 years old.

377
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:23,475
We believe they're
of Romanian descent.

378
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,995
The family travels in an RV,
but they also have another vehicle

379
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,576
<i>that they use to go back and
forth between campsites and cities.</i>

380
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:37,265
<i>We need you to call
every RV park in the area.</i>

381
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:40,615
<i>Alert the owners to be on the lookout
for a family that fits this description,</i>

382
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:44,744
As well as a campsite that might
have broken glass scattered around.

383
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:48,568
The breaking of the glass
and the discarding of Cate Hale

384
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,946
because of her epilepsy

385
00:24:50,115 --> 00:24:52,697
leads us to believe that they're
highly superstitious people

386
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,625
<i>And that they are playing
out a very specific ritual.</i>

387
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:58,221
<i>The focus of this ritual
is the young girls.</i>

388
00:25:06,635 --> 00:25:08,155
- Do we know why?
- No.

389
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,175
But we do know from
the location of Cate Hale's house

390
00:25:11,428 --> 00:25:14,316
that they don't come across
these girls by accident.

391
00:25:14,926 --> 00:25:16,716
They study. They hunt.

392
00:25:31,658 --> 00:25:34,655
Cate's father said that she liked to go
to the movies at their local multiplex.

393
00:25:34,868 --> 00:25:38,305
- That's a good place to start.
- Also look at the parks, malls.

394
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:42,434
Concentrate on those that are an easy
drive from the RV parks you locate.

395
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:45,788
This family is out there and they're
looking for their next victim.

396
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,671
You guys need to see this right now.

397
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,150
Excuse us.

398
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:53,634
- What's going on?
- Garcia, you still there?

399
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,340
- Present.
- <i>Explain what you got</i>.

400
00:25:55,465 --> 00:25:58,305
OK, I went ahead and went
further back looking for similar cases

401
00:25:58,475 --> 00:26:00,892
- and I made the search national.
- All these are hits?

402
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,735
There's 30 of them.
They go as far back as 1909.

403
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:07,607
Rapid City, South Dakota,
Taos, New Mexico, Gary, Indiana.

404
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:09,816
My map is lit up
like a Christmas tree.

405
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:12,598
All these girls were abducted
and had their parents killed?

406
00:26:12,723 --> 00:26:15,635
The time between the kills was long
enough and the regions so spread out

407
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,326
- that it never showed up as serial.
- What the hell is this?

408
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,150
I don't know, but it looks like
it's been going on for generations.

409
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,932
Reid and I will check inside.

410
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:43,405
Our highway patrol shifts're doubled and
we've got roadblocks at every line.

411
00:26:43,603 --> 00:26:46,994
- Is there a picture on the wire?
- I pulled one out of her bedroom.

412
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:07,833
- They're bound to have hours on us.
- They didn't travel that far last time.

413
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:11,628
The past killings have been years apart.
We got lucky with Cate Hale.

414
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:13,505
Her epilepsy saved her life.

415
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:15,346
If this new girl fits
the unsub's need,

416
00:27:15,471 --> 00:27:17,969
we might have lost our window
to catch them for years.

417
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,295
This is what I don't get.

418
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,281
In both this house
and the Hales' house

419
00:27:29,406 --> 00:27:31,465
the girls' bedrooms
were closest to the exit.

420
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:35,175
The unsubs had to go out of their way
to kill the parents before abducting.

421
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,697
- I think it was a countermeasure.
- What do you mean?

422
00:27:37,866 --> 00:27:40,445
They've been doing this for years
and they've never been caught.

423
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:42,718
- Why?
- They disappear in the dead of night,

424
00:27:42,843 --> 00:27:45,645
they have a head start on the cops,
and they don't kill again for years.

425
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:46,605
Exactly.

426
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:49,625
When I was a cop, I would get 10 calls
a day from parents in child abductions.

427
00:27:49,879 --> 00:27:53,113
Now, as sad as that is, if the families
didn't stay on you, at a certain point,

428
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:55,075
other cases would just
start taking priority.

429
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,591
So what are they doing
with these girls?

430
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,848
- <i>What do you got, baby girl?</i>
- Are you sitting down?

431
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:08,311
- You won't believe this.
- What's wrong?

432
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,975
I think I know what they
were doing with the girls.

433
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,733
Garcia got a hit on a hair fiber in the
blanket the unsubs used to wrap Cate.

434
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:16,425
So what's the problem?

435
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:19,572
- It belonged to Kathy Gray.
- Why does that name sound familiar?

436
00:28:20,548 --> 00:28:23,645
She went missing in 1971
after her parents were murdered.

437
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,369
So this little girl

438
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,588
- is one of our unsubs?
- That's what it looks like.

439
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,590
Call Hotch. Tell him and Prentiss not to
come here and to meet us at the station.

440
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:36,797
You OK?

441
00:28:37,217 --> 00:28:38,965
Yeah. I just need
to build a tacker skin.

442
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:42,053
You don't need to do anything
you don't want to. You understand?

443
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,496
So these little girls got abducted

444
00:28:44,621 --> 00:28:47,835
and later kidnapped other girls
and killed their families?

445
00:28:48,102 --> 00:28:52,106
I think that's why these unsubs
pick girls the same age as the boy.

446
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,856
What do you mean?

447
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,095
They're making wives.

448
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:09,480
It's OK.

449
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:12,785
I know what you're going through.

450
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:16,131
I understand. I really do.

451
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:21,132
Come here. I'm going to
take this off you now. OK?

452
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,648
Come here.

453
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:42,635
- I want my mommy.
- No, no, no, everything's OK.

454
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,814
You're a part of something now.

455
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:55,662
I was just like you.

456
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:59,231
A working theory from 1971 was
that a transient killed the family

457
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,685
<i>and abducted Kathy Gray.
Then all the leads went cold.</i>

458
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:05,105
How do you watch your family get murdered
and make a life with the murderers?

459
00:31:05,281 --> 00:31:07,645
It's Stockholm syndrome.
You adapt or die.

460
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:09,841
And now she's training
her son to be a murderer.

461
00:31:09,966 --> 00:31:13,405
At a certain point, once traditions are
handed down generation after generation,

462
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:16,915
there is no right or wrong. You simply
accept the way the world works.

463
00:31:17,085 --> 00:31:19,235
The Romany are a closed society.

464
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,816
The unsub simply twisted and distorted
traditions to become entirely insular.

465
00:31:22,941 --> 00:31:24,845
Abducting the children
keeps the bloodline pure,

466
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:27,950
and killing the parents ensures that
people eventually stop looking for them.

467
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:31,222
We got a report of an RV on fire
about 20 miles from here.

468
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:34,295
Dave, you, Reid, and Morgan
go check it out.

469
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:37,361
Garcia, I need you to digitally
alter Kathy Gray's photograph

470
00:31:37,486 --> 00:31:39,445
to simulate what she would
look like today.

471
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:41,980
- Consider it simulated.
- <i>Thanks.</i>

472
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,445
It was started less than an hour ago,
so they can't be far.

473
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,405
It looks like
they left almost everything.

474
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:10,815
The got the girl they wanted.
They're starting over.

475
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:14,221
Look at the clothes. Most of them
still have the store sensors on them.

476
00:32:14,346 --> 00:32:16,110
How'd they get them
past security scanners?

477
00:32:16,235 --> 00:32:17,725
- Tinfoil.
- Excuse me?

478
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:21,897
Cate remembers being locked in a closet
surrounded by clothing and tinfoil.

479
00:32:22,161 --> 00:32:25,024
Shoplifters use tinfoil to line
their bags and negate security alarms.

480
00:32:25,194 --> 00:32:27,845
Makes sense. A lot of Romany make
their living as petty thieves.

481
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:29,835
It also explains
the bells she heard.

482
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,995
Cate says she remembers
hearing the sound of bells,

483
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,165
Followed directly by the father
talking to the son.

484
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:37,121
I think that's probably
what the mannequin's for.

485
00:32:37,403 --> 00:32:38,955
School of the 7 bells.

486
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:41,151
You dress a mannequin,
you line a suit with 7 bells.

487
00:32:41,276 --> 00:32:44,465
If you pick his pocket without a bell
ringing, you're ready to work a crowd.

488
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:46,995
- So we know how they make their money.
- That's not all we know.

489
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,466
These unsubs are guided
entirely by ritual.

490
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:51,911
They abducted Lynn Robillard
and killed her family in an area

491
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:54,024
that was surrounded
by police and the FBI.

492
00:32:54,149 --> 00:32:55,848
They had to. They can't deviate.

493
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:58,847
We also know that they're starting over.
So they're gonna need some money.

494
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:02,285
- Where's the closest shopping mall?
- About 15 miles from here.

495
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:05,250
Hey, Hotch, we know
where they're going.

496
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,698
Focus on the high-end department
stores. They're bigger targets.

497
00:33:42,108 --> 00:33:42,994
Mom.

498
00:33:43,407 --> 00:33:44,528
Is this you?

499
00:33:54,531 --> 00:33:55,476
Ma'am!

500
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,566
Hold it! Police!

501
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,117
Set those bags down, right now.

502
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,280
Kathy Gray! Take that woman!

503
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,200
- I said put the bags down.
- Cuff her.

504
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,404
Let's go.

505
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:27,322
What's wrong?

506
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:31,135
They've been stealing for years
and they never get caught.

507
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,650
This was too easy.

508
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:39,592
Kathy, I can't help you if you're
not going to be honest with me.

509
00:34:39,717 --> 00:34:41,369
I already told you, I killed them.

510
00:34:41,555 --> 00:34:42,961
- All by yourself.
- Yes.

511
00:34:43,086 --> 00:34:44,455
- That's not true.
- It is.

512
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,915
How did you do it?

513
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,865
How did you abduct a child and control
two adults while you slit their throats?

514
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:51,905
You know she's not
responsible for this.

515
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:55,055
I know we have a string of bodies, and
she knows where her husband and son are.

516
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:58,445
- You are the victim here.
- No. She killed innocent people.

517
00:34:58,723 --> 00:35:01,835
- Her family was murdered.
- And now she's killing other people's.

518
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,853
- Kathy, this is not your fault.
- My name isn't Kathy. It's Sylvia.

519
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:08,826
No, it isn't.

520
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:11,150
Your name is Kathy Gray.

521
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,485
And you were
a beautiful little girl.

522
00:35:13,855 --> 00:35:16,786
Your mom and dad were murdered
and you were kidnapped.

523
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:18,615
Do you recognize yourself there?

524
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,265
- You see?
- I'm sick of this!

525
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,332
- Then leave us alone!
- Where are they?

526
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:29,208
Look at me. Don't listen to him.

527
00:35:29,378 --> 00:35:33,345
They stole your life.
Let me help you get it back.

528
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:35,580
That little girl is better
off with my son

529
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:37,815
than any man she could
meet in your society.

530
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:40,141
I'm sure you raised him very well.

531
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:44,056
- Tell me about your own mother.
- I've already told you everything.

532
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:47,327
- <i>I killed them, all by myself.</i>
- How's it going so far?

533
00:35:47,452 --> 00:35:50,063
They're trying to crack her by reminding
her of the girl she used to be.

534
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:52,566
I hope this good cop/bad cop
routine works.

535
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:55,736
If her family gets away,
we've lost that little girl forever.

536
00:35:56,096 --> 00:35:57,315
You're lying.

537
00:35:57,531 --> 00:35:59,485
- Kathy...
- My name isn't Kathy!

538
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:01,695
Yes, it is. Your name is Kathy Gray.

539
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,660
You're from Vienna, Virginia.

540
00:36:04,397 --> 00:36:07,914
Tell me where your husband and son are
so I can help you get your life back.

541
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,995
<i>- Want to see what you did?
- Don't show her.</i>

542
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,191
If she killed them,
she can see it again.

543
00:36:12,316 --> 00:36:14,895
Serial killers like to relive
their crimes. Did you know that?

544
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,297
This is Geoff Hale.

545
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:19,795
He died from a strong, decisive cut.
I think that was your husband.

546
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,887
Nancy Hale, her wound was more
tentative. This was your son, right?

547
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:26,080
I'm sure by the time he teaches his own
son how to kill, his hand'll be steady.

548
00:36:26,525 --> 00:36:29,611
- This is the Robillard family.
- Kathy, you don't have to look at that.

549
00:36:29,736 --> 00:36:31,539
Do you want to see some more?

550
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:37,986
- I don't know what that is.
- Then look closely!

551
00:36:39,209 --> 00:36:41,406
You don't recognize
your own mother and father?

552
00:36:45,601 --> 00:36:49,122
See? This is the tentative
cut your future husband made

553
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,935
while he slit your mother's throat.

554
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,915
Where are your husband and son?

555
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:59,044
Cate Hale is only alive because
of you, Kathy. Isn't that...

556
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,605
your... your husband wanted
to kill her, and you didn't.

557
00:37:04,426 --> 00:37:06,014
How does that make you feel?

558
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:12,428
To know that he was willing
to kill that little girl?

559
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:15,858
That he would have been
willing to kill you, too?

560
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:19,360
They murdered your family, Kathy,

561
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:22,715
and they took you in,
but you were never really one of them.

562
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,577
- You were just a breeder.
- I won't betray my family.

563
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:28,120
Your little boy is only 10.
There is a chance

564
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:30,395
<i>he could get
out of custody when he's 18,</i>

565
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,248
<i>but that's only if we get to him.</i>

566
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:34,165
<i>I love my family.</i>

567
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:36,378
- She's ready.
- <i>Then tell us where your son is</i>

568
00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:38,725
and we can all help him together.

569
00:37:43,387 --> 00:37:46,635
- Scott woodland, Zander Blanchard...
- OK, come on, give her a second.

570
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,475
- Max Estep, Chip Jackson.
- I don't know who those people are.

571
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,055
It's a list of every
known fence in Huntsville.

572
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:55,522
And you're gonna tell us who
your husband took the goods to.

573
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,795
- Coles Rudzinski, Pete Shernit,
- Let her do the right thing.

574
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,279
- Matt Thorne, Brent Woodhouse...
- OK, I can't stop him, Kathy.

575
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,698
This is your last chance
to make things right.

576
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:06,852
Kevin Everson, Mike Fenner,

577
00:38:07,109 --> 00:38:09,275
- Morris Collins...
- Stop!

578
00:38:11,207 --> 00:38:13,457
- I won't tell you.
- You just did.

579
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,293
The boy's not with him.

580
00:38:27,314 --> 00:38:28,805
Where are the children?

581
00:38:33,636 --> 00:38:36,449
I'll only tell you
if you let me see my son.

582
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:58,377
FBI! Hands in the air!
Hands in the air!

583
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,630
Get on your knees!
Down on the ground! Now!

584
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,795
We got a long list of girls
to go through with you.

585
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,425
In history, warriors invaded towns,
killed the men, women, and boys,

586
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:15,116
but kept the girls for themselves.

587
00:39:15,241 --> 00:39:19,063
You exist because your ancestors did
what was needed for you to survive.

588
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:21,358
- Get him out of here.
- You'll never find my boy!

589
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,943
We already have.

590
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,862
Come on, come on.

591
00:40:07,949 --> 00:40:09,031
It's just you now.

592
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:12,635
You're going to be strong.

593
00:40:16,686 --> 00:40:18,165
I love you, <i>puyule</i>.

594
00:40:22,277 --> 00:40:24,375
<i>Nu le spunelor despre furititai.</i>

595
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,740
What did you tell him?

596
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:31,215
Sheriff, get that videotape.
We need to get it to a translator.

597
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,587
You got it.

598
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:41,255
The translation should be
here in a few minutes.

599
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:44,025
The little girl's aunt and uncle are
on their way here from Birmingham.

600
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,945
They'll be here in a few hours.

601
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:48,095
And also, I just spoke with J.J.

602
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:50,475
She'll be at her desk by the time
we get back to Quantico.

603
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:54,395
- She has 3 more weeks.
- I know, but she's getting to be back.

604
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,705
And, honestly, I'm...

605
00:40:56,830 --> 00:41:00,325
Ready to get back to counter-terrorism.
It's where I'm needed.

606
00:41:00,584 --> 00:41:02,118
They're lucky to have you.

607
00:41:05,398 --> 00:41:07,346
- May I say something?
- Sure.

608
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,413
This team is like a family.

609
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:15,914
And families take on
the traits of their leaders.

610
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,705
- You don't show much emotion.
- Meaning what?

611
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:23,095
I've sat at J.J's desk and I've looked
at the worst things I've ever seen

612
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:24,969
just trying to do half her job.

613
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,811
I hope you don't
take her for granted.

614
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,031
I don't.

615
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:43,673
- We got the translation.
- What did she say?

616
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:47,430
"Don't tell them
about your brothers."

617
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:55,395
How many brothers do you have?

618
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:11,975
<i>Mario Puzo wrote,
"The strength of a family,</i>

619
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,990
<i>"like the strength of an army,
is in its loyalty to each other".</i>

620
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:33,504
You're almost 10.
You're becoming a man.

621
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:35,677
Are you ready?

622
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,705
I love you, <i>puyule</i>.

623
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:43,113
I love you, too.
