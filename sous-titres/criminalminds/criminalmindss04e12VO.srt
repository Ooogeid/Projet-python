<i>SARASOTA, Florida</i>

2
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,365
- State street.
- Not again.

3
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,015
Cop was just doin'his job.

4
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,455
He didn't really have
to direct traffic around me.

5
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,910
He saved dozens of lives
that day, honey.

6
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,199
All right. Now, seat belt and...

7
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,911
- No talking on the phone.
- You must be totally confident

8
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,663
so you can be aware of...

9
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,494
What's happening around you.

10
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,835
I have to go.

11
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,255
No, no, no. Come on.
It's Sunday.

12
00:00:49,425 --> 00:00:52,009
- You promised.
- Want your mom to take you?

13
00:00:52,964 --> 00:00:54,359
Come on, Andrea.

14
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,555
I'll be home before dinner.

15
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,183
Yeah, right. You said
that last time.

16
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:03,237
I was gonna tell you this later,

17
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:06,195
but I really need to see you smile.

18
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,131
So,

19
00:01:08,082 --> 00:01:10,046
when you've gotten your license,

20
00:01:10,452 --> 00:01:12,571
this little beauty is all yours.

21
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,735
Dad!

22
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,205
How do you like your old man now?

23
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,105
- But you can't let your grades slip.
- No, they won't. They won't.

24
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:27,925
Hello, Lisa.

25
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:30,035
Lisa, guess who just got a new car.

26
00:01:30,216 --> 00:01:33,025
- No way.
- And I just have to get my license.

27
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,135
- And...
- And keep my grades up.

28
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,263
Mr. Harris, can you talk to my dad?

29
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,929
- So great.
- I love it. That's awesome.

30
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,115
Did you guys hear
there's another girl missing?

31
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,355
Missy Dewald?

32
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:49,357
- What, do you know her?
- She goes to Bennett.

33
00:01:49,527 --> 00:01:52,027
High school?
All the other girls were in college.

34
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,653
Maybe it's not the same guy.

35
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:56,640
But he alternates between
black and white girls.

36
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,175
You don't read the paper?

37
00:01:59,454 --> 00:02:01,704
If he's going younger,
we're in trouble.

38
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,903
William Harris.

39
00:02:18,028 --> 00:02:19,610
What is this about?

40
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,101
William Harris, you're under arrest
for the kidnapping of Missy Dewald

41
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,895
and the murder of 3 women.

42
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,655
- You have the right to remain silent.
- You have a warrant?

43
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,900
Look in the attic, the garage,
and the storage shed.

44
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,401
She's here somewhere.

45
00:02:32,713 --> 00:02:35,488
Anything you say can and will be
held against you in a court of law.

46
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:38,005
You have the right to have an attorney
during the questioning.

47
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:40,485
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be provided for you.

48
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,843
- Do you understand these rights?
- Yes.

49
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,785
- William, what is going on?
- It's a mistake. It's a mistake.

50
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,349
I'll be home soon.

51
00:02:56,303 --> 00:02:58,676
- What are you doing?
- Got tired of waiting.

52
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,215
What's that supposed to mean?

53
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,807
You can look all you want.
Missy Dewald isn't here.

54
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,765
All week, you been sayin'
he need privacy and time.

55
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:12,608
You told me he wouldn't keep her
on his property, but I wouldn't listen.

56
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,755
Detective, we have a witness
who can place him at the abduction site.

57
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,273
He has a history of similar offenses
where he used the same m.o. in Atlanta.

58
00:03:19,398 --> 00:03:20,578
He fits the profile...

59
00:03:20,703 --> 00:03:24,395
A high-functioning successful family man
living and working in the area.

60
00:03:24,622 --> 00:03:27,956
You had probable cause. We don't have
enough to prosecute him yet.

61
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,126
- What's our next move?
- The key could be in his house,

62
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,475
So we're gonna need
to dig through his life. Family,

63
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,048
work, his friends.

64
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,410
Agent Morgan and I
will interrogate him.

65
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,283
All right.

66
00:03:41,408 --> 00:03:43,681
He holds his victims for 2 days
before he kills them.

67
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,105
Missy disappeared yesterday.

68
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,395
As long as he stays in custody, there's
a good chance she could be alive.

69
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:52,625
Talk to the detective that arrested him
for the Atlanta rapes.

70
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,442
Find out what went right and what
went wrong with their approach.

71
00:03:55,866 --> 00:03:59,245
Williams is a successful litigator,
so we're gonna need some leverage,

72
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,041
Somethin'to throw him off guard.
A discrepancy in a previous statement,

73
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,184
that's enough to give us
the upper hand.

74
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:08,122
I'll get on that. We can only hold him
for so long after he sees the judge.

75
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,511
What are the odds we can get him
to break in the next 12 hours?

76
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,330
That's not gonna be easy.

Did he do it? Did William Harris
rape and kill those girls?

86
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,795
I'm sorry. I can't answer.

87
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,845
He was the coach
of my daughter's soccer team.

88
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:27,025
Please. I'm afraid
to let her leave the house.

89
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:28,645
I know this is frustrating.

90
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,997
As soon as we get any information,
we will release it to the public.

91
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,876
Hold tight, OK?

92
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,849
Excuse me.

93
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,127
William Harris,

94
00:05:45,252 --> 00:05:47,972
I'm special agent Derek Morgan.
This is special agent David Rossi.

95
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,392
Before you answer any questions,

96
00:05:51,856 --> 00:05:55,145
I need to remind you that you're
entitled to have a lawyer present.

97
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,730
I am a lawyer.

98
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,173
She look familiar to you?

99
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,278
How about her?

100
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,661
Her?

101
00:06:16,446 --> 00:06:19,005
The three of these girls were raped,
strangled, and dumped.

102
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,131
My God. I have a daughter their age.

103
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,843
Missy Dewald.
She went missing yesterday.

104
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,290
What do you think you have on me?

105
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,433
We have a witness who can place you at
the mall the same time of her abduction.

106
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,854
And well, rumor has it
that you seem to have a history.

107
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,815
- How is that?
- Tell us about Atlanta.

108
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,120
Atlanta?

109
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:44,325
Those charges were dropped.
It was a mistake.

110
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:47,418
Because the 2 rape victims
wouldn't testify,

111
00:06:47,543 --> 00:06:50,376
and now you cover
your tracks by killing them.

112
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,803
I didn't do this.

113
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,957
So, William, you've been married,

114
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,445
what, 18 years?

115
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:03,130
You remember that feeling
you get when you fall in love?

116
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:05,924
All those firsts... the kiss,

117
00:07:06,257 --> 00:07:08,008
the smell of her hair...

118
00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:09,826
It's exciting.

119
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:13,800
You miss that feeling, don't you?

120
00:07:14,371 --> 00:07:16,970
Being married to the same woman,
it's like

121
00:07:17,095 --> 00:07:19,896
ordering the same entree
for 18 years.

122
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,585
Agent Rossi, every minute
you spend with me

123
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,455
is another minute
she's alone with him.

124
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,573
So we've brought in the wrong guy?

125
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,034
Just like they did in Atlanta.

126
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:37,081
And by the time you realize
I've been telling the truth...

127
00:07:39,085 --> 00:07:41,668
This poor girl could be dead.

128
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,915
Would you prefer to do this alone?

129
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,221
This may be too disturbing
for your daughter.

130
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:56,517
It's OK. We have no secrets.

131
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,560
Can you account for William's
whereabouts for the last 24 hours?

132
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,439
- My dad was at home with us.
- The whole time?

133
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,276
He may have ran out for about an
hour or so. I really don't remember.

134
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,737
3 girls have been
murdered, Mrs. Harris.

135
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,614
Missy Dewald is missing now,
and she's running out of time.

136
00:08:11,784 --> 00:08:13,015
That's not my fault.

137
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,595
How would you feel
if someone was hurting Andrea?

138
00:08:16,355 --> 00:08:17,996
Why did you move?

139
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,207
My dad got a better offer
with another firm.

140
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,895
It had nothing to do
with the rape charges in Atlanta?

141
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,510
Those charges were dropped.

142
00:08:24,635 --> 00:08:27,673
Do you really think it's a coincidence
he's been a suspect twice?

143
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,498
It was a mistake,

144
00:08:30,762 --> 00:08:31,957
just like this.

145
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,852
Has William been distant lately?
Spent a lot of time behind closed doors?

146
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,590
He works a lot. Is that a crime?

147
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:42,624
I think you've known something
is off,

148
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,488
and it's made you wonder.

149
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,482
It's something only you would know.

150
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:51,420
Mrs. Harris, you can save
Missy Dewald's life,

151
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,961
in spite of what's happening
in your family.

152
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,081
That's enough.
This interview is over.

153
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:11,550
- You find anything?
- Give me a minute. I'll find the grime.

154
00:09:11,896 --> 00:09:14,220
All right. You ready to start
searching his computer?

155
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:15,910
Born ready.

156
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:21,727
- Seem to be in control.
- I'm always in control, sweet cheeks.

157
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,955
So far, William Harris appears
to be quite intelligent.

158
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,858
- He's covering his tracks pretty well.
- <i>Yeah, just because</i>

159
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:30,783
you delete your history,
doesn't mean all your dirty cyberlaundry

160
00:09:30,908 --> 00:09:33,335
isn't hanging out there for me
to find on your hard drive.

161
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,740
Rookie mistake.

162
00:09:39,284 --> 00:09:40,787
- Keep moving, sir.
- Bailiff...

163
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,370
Mr. Harris can have
a few moments with his family.

164
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,043
- Dad.
- Honey.

165
00:09:48,581 --> 00:09:49,705
How's my girl?

166
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,965
- I'll be fine once you're home.
- I'm workin'on that.

167
00:09:53,205 --> 00:09:54,616
How you doin'?

168
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,815
I know. Believe me, I know.

169
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,972
But, they don't have a case.

170
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,017
Honey, bail was set at $5 million.
They must have something.

171
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,019
Well, after Atlanta...

172
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,939
OK, so what should I do? Should I
pull money from the retirement fund?

173
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,150
- Just use the house.
- The house?

174
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:12,379
Where are we gonna go
if something happens?

175
00:10:12,504 --> 00:10:14,895
- Everything is gonna be fine.
- Mr. Harris.

176
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,299
I have to go.

177
00:10:16,424 --> 00:10:17,963
- Look after your mom.
- I will.

178
00:10:18,088 --> 00:10:20,494
I need you to be
strong. I love you both.

179
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,433
We love you, too, honey.

180
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:32,195
Did you see how Sharon reacted
when he said to put up the house?

181
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,896
She's starting to doubt him.

182
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:38,262
Garcia's been digging his PC. She found
an encrypted link to a web page.

183
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,799
- Where'd it take you?
- An unsearchable,

184
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,822
untraceable blog
with tons of journal entries.

185
00:10:42,947 --> 00:10:45,415
- It's like some sort of diary.
- You find anything incriminating?

186
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,415
I was able to differentiate
between 2 distinct voices, 2 authors.

187
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,108
I found various idiosyncratic words,
phrases, punctuation,

188
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,105
And orthography within the blog entries
consistent with each separate person...

189
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,787
Words like "soda" and "pop."

190
00:10:55,912 --> 00:10:58,870
One guy uses dashes
while the other uses ellipses.

191
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,645
Where'd you find this kid?

192
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:05,735
He was left in a basket
on the steps of the F.B.I.

193
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,251
One side of the discourse made
a reference to the devil's strip.

194
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,151
- What the hell's that?
- It's a small patch of grass

195
00:11:12,276 --> 00:11:14,066
that separates the sidewalk
from the street.

196
00:11:14,191 --> 00:11:16,265
That term is only used
in central Ohio.

197
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,968
William lived in Atlanta for 20 years,
but he grew up in Columbus.

198
00:11:19,196 --> 00:11:22,515
The other guy uses words like
"turnpike" and "filling the gas tank,"

199
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,330
Both specific regionalisms
for Florida.

200
00:11:26,659 --> 00:11:28,306
Kid, you sure about this?

201
00:11:29,586 --> 00:11:30,479
Right.

202
00:11:32,184 --> 00:11:33,988
Was there a new development?

203
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:37,875
"Can't remember the last time
I smiled for so long that it hurt.

204
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,205
"I've never felt like this before."

205
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:43,410
Sounds like you're bored at home.
Havin' an affair?

206
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,174
I told you I'm happily married.

207
00:11:46,801 --> 00:11:49,214
Does your wife know
about your secret diary?

208
00:11:49,695 --> 00:11:52,126
I bet she'd like to know
how good you are at keeping secrets.

209
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,275
I'm not sure
what you think you've found,

210
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,924
But you've gone from completely
wrong to completely insane.

211
00:11:58,487 --> 00:11:59,735
You're hiding something.

212
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:03,722
No jury will convict me
because somebody saw me at the mall

213
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,517
And you think I'm talking
with someone other than my wife.

214
00:12:10,081 --> 00:12:11,480
We found Missy.

215
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,491
Told you so.

216
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,165
You son of a bitch!

217
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:17,411
- Detective, no!
- Damn you!

218
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:24,034
That's her.

219
00:12:24,521 --> 00:12:25,582
That's Missy.

220
00:12:26,266 --> 00:12:28,955
I looked her father in the eye
and swore I'd find her alive.

221
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:32,626
So since we've been here, this girl's
gone missing and now turned up dead.

222
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,415
Do you think he dumped
the body before he was picked up?

223
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:38,095
The m.e. estimates
she was killed several hours ago.

224
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,008
But we've had
William Harris in custody.

225
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,805
- You think we have the wrong guy?
- I don't think so.

226
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,595
He's communicating with someone.

227
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,675
He's confident
they won't turn against him.

228
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,393
I don't think he's having an affair.

229
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,436
He has a partner.

230
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,314
And that partner's doing everything
he can to get Harris out of jail.

231
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,239
<i>"I love the challenges..."
"the only suspense for tonight..."</i>

232
00:13:03,409 --> 00:13:05,995
<i>"was tough, but I figured it out..."
"perfect timing..."</i>

233
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,370
<i>"I watch them chase
their little spawns..."</i>

234
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:12,555
<i>"... passage truly.
Those first few hours are the best."</i>

235
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,543
<i>"Faith should never be broken."</i>

236
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,839
Tell me you found his partner.

237
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,634
It's all so cryptic.

238
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:28,586
"The end of the day came too soon."

239
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,395
Well, they clearly
enjoyed being together.

240
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,185
They wrote a cluster of others after
the 1st victim, Kim Groves, was killed.

241
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,657
We need to know how they met.

242
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:38,733
There's gotta be something
about their courtship.

243
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,945
"It all seemed so hopeless,
but I finally learned to rise above it."

244
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:45,323
It sounds like William confessed
he was feeling incomplete.

245
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:48,785
He was. He didn't start killing
until he met his soul mate.

246
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,545
"Faith should never be broken."

247
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:54,810
The longer they got away with it,
the stronger their relationship.

248
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,595
These two aren't just obsessed
with rape and murder.

249
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,755
They're addicted to one another.

250
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:01,885
We could have saved her.

251
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:04,759
There were no signs of his
having a partner until now.

252
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,469
That's why he's so cocky.

253
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,971
His arrogance is typical
of a dominant personality.

254
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:11,098
He's found a submissive
who kill for him.

255
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:14,525
The partner is a biter.
We found marks on Missy Dewald.

256
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,141
They never did that.

257
00:14:16,266 --> 00:14:18,430
With William out of the picture,
he's changed.

258
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:22,068
Maybe the partner went back to something
comfortable, something he's done before.

259
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,770
I've got Garcia checking dental
records against other cases.

260
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,395
D.A. was ready to charge him
when Missy was still alive.

261
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,710
How the hell are we supposed
to keep him now?

262
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:40,545
I'm surprised you're writing
all this stuff to a fella.

263
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:43,798
Sounds like you have
a real special thing goin' on.

264
00:14:44,245 --> 00:14:46,245
I'm thinkin' if the 2 of you
had just got it on,

265
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:48,136
Maybe these women
would still be alive.

266
00:14:48,795 --> 00:14:52,815
So where'd you meet him?
Chat room? Porn sites? Gay bar?

267
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:56,175
Whoever this guy is, he's lookin' out
for you, cleaned up for you.

268
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,314
- Missy Dewald is dead.
- Has he called yet?

269
00:14:59,819 --> 00:15:01,623
Lee jarvis,the D.A.

270
00:15:02,512 --> 00:15:04,555
I saw his name on the warrant.

271
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,915
He's got the best
conviction rate in Florida.

272
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,400
Do you know why?

273
00:15:09,525 --> 00:15:12,825
I wanna know why your pen pal killed her
when he could have let her rot.

274
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,751
Jarvis doesn't like to lose.

275
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,712
He's not gonna ruin
his record over this.

276
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,545
This friend of yours wants
to please you bad, doesn't he?

277
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,478
He's protecting you,

278
00:15:23,603 --> 00:15:26,049
doin' whatever he's gotta do
to make sure that you're innocent.

279
00:15:26,218 --> 00:15:28,301
He killed Missy so you
could be together again.

280
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,747
It's only been a few hours,

281
00:15:31,137 --> 00:15:32,597
but he misses you.

282
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:35,705
And you've gotten
what exactly from all this?

283
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:38,562
Proof that someone out there
is just as sick as you.

284
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:43,567
It turns out there's a lot of sick pups
in central Florida.

285
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:46,235
Today's dental records
do not match William Harris,

286
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,405
but do match a reported rape
in Manatee county earlier this year.

287
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:52,701
- That's great. You got a match.
- The teeth belong to the same person,

288
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,744
Any arrests,
I can't cross-reference.

289
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,289
- What about the victim?
- Connie Mayers.

290
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:59,398
She still lives in the area.

291
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,562
They're gonna ask who you are.

292
00:16:03,104 --> 00:16:04,435
They don't know.

293
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,549
- We're just buying flowers.
- Those daisies are nice.

294
00:16:08,598 --> 00:16:11,511
In your report, it says your attacker
knew what he wanted,

295
00:16:11,724 --> 00:16:13,096
that he was confident.

296
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,098
More like a control freak.

297
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,733
He wore a mask,
but I could tell he was white.

298
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,271
He choked me.

299
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:24,482
Took a long time
for the bruises to go away.

300
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:29,529
I swear when the light's right,
I can still see his hand right here.

301
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,114
I'm sorry.

302
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:35,674
It's not as bad as the bite marks.
I mean, they're scars now.

303
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:41,583
I haven't been with anyone since,
so I haven't had to explain.

304
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,792
- Let me wrap these for you.
- Thank you.

305
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:51,065
Connie described an anger-excitation
rapist just like William.

306
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:53,075
So we're lookin' at 2
dominant personalities.

307
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,681
Makes sense. They have a similar
discourse. They're equally well-written.

308
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,275
- That's a big deal.
- It's rare in criminal partnerships.

309
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:03,854
If their personalities are the same,
their lives are probably like mirrors.

310
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:06,175
Harris goes to church,
on the board of the p.t.a.,

311
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,555
Coaches his daughter's
soccer team, rarely drinks.

312
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,795
Sounds like a saint.

313
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,491
With a dark side. That's what
he connected to in the partner.

314
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:15,386
We will go talk to the family,
see if they know who it might be.

315
00:17:19,463 --> 00:17:21,080
2 alpha males
won't be easy to break.

316
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,792
The partner is definitely
following the investigation.

317
00:17:24,258 --> 00:17:26,920
- Let's do the talking for them.
- I put this out in the public?

318
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:29,923
- We've got something better.
- Why would he read it?

319
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:33,365
- He knows William won't be writing.
- These men are addicted to each other.

320
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,304
He needs a fix, and the words they've
shared are all he has to cling to.

321
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,045
His partner wrote
"faith should never be broken."

322
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:41,085
A betrayal could devastate him.

323
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:44,180
All we have to say is that
William's cooperating...

324
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,231
And then hope he takes the bait.

325
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,953
Have you noticed William
pay extra attention to anyone?

326
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,855
Or has he gone out of
his way to avoid anyone?

327
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:55,805
We've been here for 6 months,
still got boxes to unpack.

328
00:17:56,084 --> 00:17:59,035
Suggesting that William's found time
to bond with someone?

329
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,199
You know, we think
we know the ones we love,

330
00:18:02,098 --> 00:18:03,996
but everybody can keep secrets.

331
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:09,225
The man we're looking for
is just like your dad.

332
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,864
He's smart, strong, confident.

333
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,185
He may have a family also.

334
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,762
So now you're gonna accuse
someone else's Dad of murder.

335
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,330
That's really great.

336
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,516
It is the last thing we wanna do.

337
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:27,147
We believe the accomplice
has done this before.

338
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:32,369
That victim described
a white man in his forties.

339
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,612
This may be someone
you would recognize.

340
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:38,357
And there's a good chance
he's gonna check up on you.

341
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,945
And why would he do that?

342
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:43,105
He's worried about your dad, but he has
no way of communicating with him.

343
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,832
You and your mom
are the next best thing.

344
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:50,269
He's uncertain right now, and that may
manifest itself in mood swings.

345
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,633
We made a deal after Atlanta.

346
00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:00,423
There wouldn't be a chance
for any more misunderstandings.

347
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,332
And how's that working out for you?

348
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,425
So do you like where you live?

349
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:10,565
- I do. Yeah. D.C.'s nice.
- So is this place.

350
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,261
Now it's just like Atlanta.

351
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:17,348
Everyone thinks my dad's guilty,
and it'll just get worse.

352
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,220
I'm sorry about that.

353
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,314
- What have we got so far?
- "We were surprised

354
00:19:26,439 --> 00:19:29,035
"that you injected yourself
into the investigation.

355
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,795
"You risked a lot in
order to help William."

356
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,055
And killin' Missy tells us
how close you really are.

357
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,592
It must be devastating to learn
that William is here with us.

358
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,386
He's not gonna like that.
Sounds like William's cooperating.

359
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:43,973
That's exactly what we want,
so he'll doubt their alliance.

360
00:19:53,718 --> 00:19:56,625
- Most entries followed the 1st murder.
- Yeah, William wrote most of them.

361
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,330
"I wasn't expecting
that type of gift.

362
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:03,326
"I wish time didn't take away
all the pleasures of the day."

363
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:11,793
Gotta see this.

364
00:20:27,155 --> 00:20:28,393
What's that smirk?

365
00:20:29,467 --> 00:20:31,495
Sharon is posting bail.

366
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,020
I'm thinkin' about
where to go for dinner.

367
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:38,065
You know, maybe we got it wrong.
Maybe they're not both alpha males.

368
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,155
Maybe we'll go to Salvatores.

369
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,531
Partner made the first move.
He's the one with the balls.

370
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,658
Yeah, and it was pretty risky, too.

371
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:47,255
Think about it.
What if you did turn in here?

372
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:49,747
Or at least your partner
thought you turned in here.

373
00:20:49,987 --> 00:20:53,376
Then he'd have no choice but to turn
himself in. Your lives would be ruined.

374
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,797
That's the reason it works.
You both have everything to lose.

375
00:20:58,162 --> 00:21:01,235
He's only cleaning up because he can't
afford to get caught either. Am I right?

376
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:03,761
How is gonna react
to the entry we wrote?

377
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:08,165
He knows we're reading
your little love letters,

378
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:10,935
so we decided to send one ourselves,

379
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,985
Let him know you're in here
helping us out.

380
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,441
He's probably feeling pretty
betrayed right about now.

381
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,371
And if he is, what do you
think he's doin' about it?

382
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:23,239
William, you wrote,
"thanks for the perfect place to play."

383
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:26,291
What were you talkin' about?

384
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:29,049
- Golfing.
- Golfing?

385
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,590
Golfing.

386
00:21:31,514 --> 00:21:32,475
Right.

387
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,393
What was it like?

388
00:21:35,292 --> 00:21:36,127
Perfect.

389
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,350
I've never let 'em see
my face before.

390
00:21:44,751 --> 00:21:46,975
- Me either.
- You think she's gonna talk?

391
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:50,426
They all think about it,
but too scared.

392
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,813
I don't know. This one,
this one seems defiant.

393
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,566
Well, I don't think
we should risk it.

394
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,655
Blood's... Not my thing.

395
00:22:01,947 --> 00:22:03,709
It doesn't have to be messy.

396
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:09,392
You mean like this?

397
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:14,707
Yeah, like that.

398
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:24,063
You probably don't recognize
'em like this, do you, William?

399
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,070
Happy and smilin'.

400
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:30,539
All these gifts.

401
00:22:31,239 --> 00:22:32,535
All these girls.

402
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,728
This is someone's child.

403
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,942
You know, Missy Dewald, she was
supposed to meet her parents for dinner.

404
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:44,540
She was 18 years old, an only child,

405
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,824
and you just took her away.

406
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:51,761
I feel sorry for those parents.
I really do.

407
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,268
Do you hear yourself?

408
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,708
Not an ounce of sincerity.

409
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,794
You just proved you were
incapable of empathy.

410
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,171
Just like your partner.

411
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,490
William, you never would have
done any of this without him.

412
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,845
But you just weren't complete,
right?

413
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,345
- Wait. What is that?
- Honey, stay here.

414
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,680
- Mom...
- Stay here.

415
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:34,825
What the hell?

416
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,816
Damn kids.

417
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,478
Don't you worry, Sharon.

418
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:43,212
We are gonna take care of this.

419
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,134
Thank you.

420
00:23:53,221 --> 00:23:56,580
"It's been so long, my heart aches.

421
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00,150
"I need to see
that face again soon."

422
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:06,317
I mean, it's pretty obvious there's
an emotional connection between you two.

423
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,298
Can't deny that.

424
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,795
But, you know,

425
00:24:13,732 --> 00:24:15,807
doesn't really sound like
2 buddies to me.

426
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:18,924
Sounds more like 2 men
in love with each other.

427
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:22,835
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

428
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,275
You're right.

429
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,465
I have absolutely no idea what it's like
to be in love with another man.

430
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:30,392
You know, everyone
who goes into law enforcement...

431
00:24:30,517 --> 00:24:33,136
has this air of moral superiority.

432
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,419
You,

433
00:24:34,917 --> 00:24:37,600
it seeps out of every single pore.

434
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,131
Black cop in the F.B.I.

435
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,773
You got a big chip
on your shoulder, lot to prove.

436
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,277
Now who's the one who has no idea
what he's talkin' about?

437
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:51,031
We're not so different, you and I.

438
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:55,576
The games we play, we chose
because they make us feel powerful.

439
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:57,471
So,

440
00:24:58,293 --> 00:25:01,450
what do you have,
special agent Morgan?

441
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:05,124
Prove beyond a reasonable doubt
that I have broken the law.

442
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,640
But don't you sit there with that smug
look on your face and judge me, boy.

443
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,971
First of all, I am not your boy,

444
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,222
and this look on my face

445
00:25:17,661 --> 00:25:20,143
is a look of contempt,
because you disgust me.

446
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,792
You and I are nothin' alike.

447
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:32,402
<i>When we do find this,
friend of yours,</i>

448
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:35,735
there isn't a jury out there
who won't find you guilty.

449
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,708
- How's it goin' in there?
- We're just tradin' punches.

450
00:25:44,022 --> 00:25:46,730
He's watchin' the clock,
waitin' for his bail to be posted.

451
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,965
- I can't thank you enough.
- You don't need to.

452
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:54,980
I just wish I could have
done a better job for you.

453
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,763
What's goin' on?

454
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,017
Steven cleaned up the mess outside.

455
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:03,394
- Why?
- Andrea, don't be rude.

456
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,035
It's OK, Sharon.

457
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,314
I like to help out
a friend whenever I can.

458
00:26:07,484 --> 00:26:09,441
I didn't even know
you and my dad were friends.

459
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:12,695
Look, I know how hard
this must be for you.

460
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:14,947
Just know your dad
is gonna be home soon.

461
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,241
People are gonna forget
this ever happened.

462
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,765
Everything's gonna go back the way
it was before. Have a good day.

463
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:23,500
- Thank you.
- Somehow I doubt that.

464
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,605
- What was that about?
- Why is he so nice all of a sudden?

465
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:32,298
This is exactly what those F.B.I.
people said to look out for.

466
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:35,307
I will not have you alienate
the only person who's been kind to us

467
00:26:35,432 --> 00:26:38,262
since your father was arrested.
You understand me?

468
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:48,376
- Something?
- One day, the partner wrote,

469
00:26:48,501 --> 00:26:51,140
"I feel like such an outsider.
No one understands me.

470
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,315
"I watch them chase their little spawns,
the same old conversations.

471
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,735
"Nothing stimulates me."

472
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:59,199
- Sounds like a party with kids.
- And somebody wasn't happy to be there.

473
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:02,655
"I looked over, and everything changed.
The only spark in my day."

474
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:06,680
This is it. It's buried,
but he's talking about their 1st met.

475
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,805
"I looked across the room,
and everything changed.

476
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,695
"The only spark in my day."

477
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:21,139
"It feels so good,
so free, so right."

478
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,725
You moved here 6 months ago.

479
00:27:25,331 --> 00:27:27,436
You met him some time
after that, didn't you?

480
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,659
Thanks, man. Here you go, buddy.

481
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:38,685
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

482
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:40,385
- Will Harris.
- Steve Baleman.

483
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,043
Saw you movin' in last week.

484
00:27:42,168 --> 00:27:44,475
- You all unpacked?
- For the most part.

485
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,560
But my wife Sharon,
she's, she's amazing.

486
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:50,215
She takes care of the house.
I take care of the rest.

487
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,595
That's a good woman.

488
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,985
Let me tell you, took me a while,
but I finally got Annie trained.

489
00:27:55,258 --> 00:27:56,387
Hey, sweetie.

490
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,968
You're a lucky man.

491
00:28:02,182 --> 00:28:04,634
- What do we have here?
- Thank you.

492
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,671
You're too kind, ladies.

493
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,368
Most people around here

494
00:28:12,493 --> 00:28:15,151
would be pretty excited
about this plain old burger here.

495
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:17,612
But it's really nothin' special.

496
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,707
Well, a good piece of meat
would be nice.

497
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:25,103
Stick to your bones.

498
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:27,121
Bloody rare and tender.

499
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:32,230
Well, variety is the spice of life.

500
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,709
I couldn't agree more.

501
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:38,270
Cheers.

502
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:44,305
- You think that's funny?
- No, I just remembered something.

503
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:48,212
I hope you enjoy, because they're all
you're gonna have in prison.

504
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,477
You know what you are?

505
00:28:56,602 --> 00:28:57,592
You're lost.

506
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,614
You've been runnin' from yourself
your entire life, tryin' to disappear.

507
00:29:01,932 --> 00:29:03,741
Did I say something that upset you?

508
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:06,130
What'd you think
you were gonna do, man?

509
00:29:06,407 --> 00:29:09,830
What, if you got away from Atlanta, all
these little urges, they'd just go away?

510
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:12,154
So you go find another posh
little uppity neighborhood,

511
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:14,375
and you think it might make you
feel a little better?

512
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,295
Make you feel whole, more complete?

513
00:29:16,937 --> 00:29:18,815
Didn't work too well,
though, did it?

514
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,042
Nothin' seems to make William happy,

515
00:29:21,167 --> 00:29:23,177
not even his beautiful wife
and daughter.

516
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:26,145
But then you wake up
one day, and there he is,

517
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:29,392
Somebody just as sick and pathetic as
you are, and your whole world changes.

518
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:33,771
Is all this about
that black comment?

519
00:29:34,626 --> 00:29:37,441
You really think that we're the same
because of our skin color?

520
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,575
That's all we have in common.

521
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,500
You hurt innocent people. I don't.

522
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:45,689
You're not even a man.

523
00:29:45,814 --> 00:29:47,745
- That a fact?
- That is a fact.

524
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:50,121
If you had anything,
I'd be in a cell by now.

525
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,534
You will be.

526
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:03,405
Shouldn't be outside, Andrea.
It's not safe.

527
00:30:03,849 --> 00:30:07,849
Oh, wait. Your dad's in jail.
We have nothing to worry about.

528
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,850
- What's your problem?
- My problem?

529
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:12,767
I'm not the one
with the freaky family.

530
00:30:12,937 --> 00:30:15,855
- Shut up.
- Is that why you moved from Atlanta?

531
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:19,085
- Your dad was rapin' girls there too.
- He didn't do it.

532
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:21,145
That's not what the newspaper said.

533
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:24,415
You know, you're about
the same age as those girls.

534
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,073
I bet he started with you.

535
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:30,332
- What's goin' on over there?
- Nothin'.

536
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:33,802
Everybody needs
to go home right now.

537
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,160
Loser.

538
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:42,595
- You OK?
- Yeah. They're just being jerks.

539
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,425
Now, look, I saw your mom was gone.

540
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:47,095
If you need any company,
I'm around, OK?

541
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,289
I'm fine. Really. Really.

542
00:30:55,563 --> 00:30:57,445
We need to figure
out where that party was.

543
00:30:57,570 --> 00:31:00,315
Let's review one more time.
I'm a serial killer writing my partner.

544
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,902
- Why do I keep a secret blog?
- It's a safe way to relive your crimes.

545
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:07,490
No one ever sees you together,
and, no one overhears you talking.

546
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:11,435
I'd buy all that. Sounds like
they take turns surprising each other.

547
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,465
Listen to this.
"I love the challenges.

548
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:16,165
"The timing is always perfect.
Thanks for tonight.

549
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:19,835
"It was tough, but I figured it out.
Nothing was gonna keep me away."

550
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,595
What are you thinking?

551
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,840
- They never write about a time.
- So how'd they know when to meet?

552
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,465
Steven, what are you doing?

553
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,695
Don't walk away!
We need to talk about this!

554
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,894
I told you, leave me alone!

555
00:31:47,186 --> 00:31:48,225
<i>What have we got?</i>

556
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:51,360
The victims were abducted at different
times of day. It was never consistent.

557
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:54,410
One was taken on Thanksgiving morning
when she went to the market for her mom.

558
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,524
Except the blog,
there is nothing else suspicious

559
00:31:56,649 --> 00:31:58,520
on Mr. Sneaky's phone
or his computer.

560
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:01,805
<i>All texts, numbers, and files
have been accounted for.</i>

561
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:05,047
- What did they do to communicate?
- We're missing something.

562
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,785
We know based on the language
and the knowledge of the area

563
00:32:19,022 --> 00:32:21,604
that the partner was most likely
born and raised in Florida.

564
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,274
<i>OK, let's work with the theory</i>

565
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:26,115
- that the partner lives in Sarasota.
- They don't call. They don't write.

566
00:32:26,362 --> 00:32:28,821
The signal could be something visual,
or audible.

567
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:31,465
<i>If it's visual, that could be a flag
on their house.</i>

568
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,501
If it's audible, they'd have to live
close enough to each other to hear it.

569
00:32:34,626 --> 00:32:38,372
Something audible.
Something you can hear. What if...

570
00:32:38,983 --> 00:32:41,155
<i>What if they're not writing
poetry to each other?</i>

571
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:44,185
What if they're writing
lyrics to a song?

572
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:47,154
"This feels so good, so free,

573
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:49,550
- <i>"so right."</i>
- Give me something else.

574
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:53,178
"It looks so right.
It's all I need tonight."

575
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,858
I found it.

576
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:01,315
Garcia, that's it. That was playing
when we pulled in to the cul-de-sac.

577
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,063
It was coming out of a car.

578
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,785
That's how they knew
to go back to Missy.

579
00:33:17,105 --> 00:33:19,370
The partner lives nearby.
They met at a neighborhood party.

580
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:21,832
Garcia, we need to know
which neighbor it is.

581
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,082
The parameters.

582
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,460
A white male.

583
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:27,087
<i>- Married, with children.
- He's either got a good steady job,</i>

584
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,882
- or he owns his own business.
- He's lived in Florida his entire life.

585
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,825
Within close proximity to William,
there are 7 white males.

586
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:52,278
5 are married with children.

587
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:54,635
<i>2 were born and raised
in the sunshine state.</i>

588
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,255
<i>One is on disability.</i>

589
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,555
One owns a real estate business.

590
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:02,350
Oh, my God. He lives right next door.
Steven Baleman.

591
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,422
Steven Baleman.

592
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:40,953
Are you following me?

593
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:42,996
Are you?

594
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,795
He was angry and just took off.

595
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,145
- Why was he upset?
- He's been like this all day.

596
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:53,391
- When did it start?
- I don't know.

597
00:34:54,218 --> 00:34:55,384
This morning.

598
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:59,425
So after William was arrested,
he became hostile, didn't he, nervous?

599
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:00,806
Steven is a good man.

600
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:03,044
He's not who you think he is.

601
00:35:08,357 --> 00:35:10,480
- Did you see Andrea out here?
- No.

602
00:35:11,903 --> 00:35:13,385
Why is Annie crying?

603
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:15,675
We think that Steven
is William's accomplice.

604
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,740
- Where's he?
- We're trying to figure that out.

605
00:35:17,972 --> 00:35:19,078
Oh, my God.

606
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:23,245
Andrea said it was strange
that he was the only nice one.

607
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,497
He was checking in on us.

608
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:28,365
I wasn't listening. I'm sorry.

609
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:30,043
Now they're both gone.

610
00:35:30,352 --> 00:35:31,879
It's time you talked to William.

611
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,341
No, Steven Baleman
is not just your neighbor.

612
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,745
- And you know this how?
- You told us.

613
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:41,575
Those don't prove anything.

614
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,711
And after all this time,
you figuring out who my neighbor is,

615
00:35:44,836 --> 00:35:46,748
feels like a really small victory.

616
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:53,358
Where did Steven take Andrea?

617
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:56,845
What are you talkin' about?

618
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:59,887
She suspected him,
and now they're both missing.

619
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,035
How could you? She believed you.

620
00:36:03,656 --> 00:36:05,085
They're missing?

621
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:07,539
All those times you disappeared,
I knew it wasn't work.

622
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:12,182
I thought maybe, maybe
you were having an affair,

623
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,881
And I couldn't confront you,
because then that would make it real.

624
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,115
Then I'd have to find
the truth buried in your lies,

625
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,775
And you have been paid
to lie for so long.

626
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,099
It is who you are!

627
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,478
All of this is almost too much. It's
too much for anybody to put up with.

628
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:33,107
But it's almost over.

629
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,984
I didn't put up the house.

630
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:39,780
You... you didn't post bail?

631
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,365
I didn't wanna believe it in Atlanta,
and I'm not gonna deny it again.

632
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:47,246
Now, where did Steven take Andrea?

633
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,915
Where is she?

634
00:36:51,171 --> 00:36:52,694
Where is...

635
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:57,350
You son of a...
you son of a bitch!

636
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,965
How'd that feel, William?

637
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:10,227
You see what you're doin'?

638
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,897
Kim Groves, your words...

639
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:16,095
"The first few hours are the best.

640
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,694
"Nobody's run out of steam yet."

641
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:22,536
Andrea's been gone for 2 hours.

642
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,240
What's he doing to her right now?

643
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:29,621
What is he doin', William?
Touchin' her?

644
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,855
Maybe he's bitin' her?

645
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:35,462
This is what he does
when you're not around.

646
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:39,631
Your little boyfriend is twisted,
and now he's got your baby girl.

647
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,865
You know better than us.

648
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:45,050
Has she been in pain
this whole time?

649
00:37:46,474 --> 00:37:48,345
Steven took your daughter.

650
00:37:48,517 --> 00:37:52,102
The man you trusted
with your life has betrayed you.

651
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:55,063
What, is nothin' sacred to you?

652
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:04,055
So Steven has a couple of commercial
properties, but so far, there's nothing.

653
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,435
Only he knows
where Steven took Andrea.

654
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,725
I can't believe he sold out
his daughter to protect his partner.

655
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:11,250
He's protecting himself.

656
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:14,145
The minute he says anything,
he's guilty.

657
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:16,460
<i>What was it you said about Missy?</i>

658
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,586
Man, turn around and look at me!

659
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,759
For every minute that goes by,
he's alone with her, right?

660
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,774
Well, it's Andrea's turn now.

661
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,305
What's wrong with you?

662
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:32,205
Why aren't you tryin' to run out
that door and save your child?

663
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:34,455
You think he's not gonna hurt her?
Why?

664
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:37,816
Did you make some kind of deal?
Family's off-limits?

665
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:41,727
<i>The longer you are in here,
the worse it looked for Steven.</i>

666
00:38:42,356 --> 00:38:44,905
<i>He think you're in here betraying
him, so now he's actin' out.</i>

667
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:46,572
<i>He's lost faith.</i>

668
00:38:46,742 --> 00:38:49,326
He is alone with your little girl.

669
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:54,955
She's cryin' out for you, sayin',
"daddy, why aren't you helpin' me?".

670
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,793
Why? Because you're
standin' here, doin' nothin'.

671
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,051
William... You're the only person
who can stop this.

672
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:11,223
Be a man.
For god sakes, be a father.

673
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,475
- Dad, thank God.
- You're gonna be OK.

674
00:39:28,701 --> 00:39:31,325
It's Steven. It's Steven.
I don't know where he went.

675
00:39:31,713 --> 00:39:33,353
I'm gonna get you out of here.

676
00:39:36,061 --> 00:39:38,775
- Did he hurt you?
- Did you think I'd hurt her?

677
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,960
That I'd betray you?

678
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,607
Or is that because
that's what you did to me?

679
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,799
I didn't tell them anything.

680
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:51,555
You didn't tell them anything?
Dad, what are you talking about?

681
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:54,740
Wait. How did you even
know that I was here?

682
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,905
Andrea, honey, trust me.

683
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:59,292
Daddy's gonna make it OK. OK?

684
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:04,358
- We had a deal.
- Faith should never be broken.

685
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:07,279
- You took my daughter!
- She followed me here!

686
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:10,554
She never would have said anything.

687
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:14,104
I never would have said anything?

688
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:16,675
Honey,

689
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:18,945
Andrea, please.

690
00:40:19,126 --> 00:40:21,570
Just... just trust me.
Trust me, OK?

691
00:40:22,296 --> 00:40:23,748
So how'd you get out?

692
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,967
The case...
the case was dismissed.

693
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:31,720
Oh, really? Simple as that?

694
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:33,388
You killed Missy Dewald

695
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,400
<i>while I was in custody.
They couldn't hold me.</i>

696
00:40:35,525 --> 00:40:36,682
He talked about Missy.

697
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,408
So he killed Missy Dewald, and what?

698
00:40:39,673 --> 00:40:41,229
What?
You killed all the others?

699
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,992
- Honey, please.
- No.

700
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,975
Don't... don't come close to me.

701
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,945
I had your back.

702
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:53,853
What were you gonna do?
What if I hadn't shown up?

703
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,619
Were you gonna kill her?

704
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,845
- F.B.I.!
- Don't move! You're under arrest!

705
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:05,337
Don't even think about it!

706
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,845
Mom. Get me out of here.
Get me out of here.

707
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:43,665
OK. You're gonna be OK.

708
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:46,974
- I wanna go away, OK?
- OK. I promise, baby.

709
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,550
The guy wanted just to see
his partner again.

710
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:54,371
They needed to say good-bye.

711
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,725
Those two had everything figured out

712
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:59,057
except how it would end.

713
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:14,155
<i>British historian
C. Northcote Parkinson said,</i>

714
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,757
<i>"Delay is the deadliest
form of denial."</i>
