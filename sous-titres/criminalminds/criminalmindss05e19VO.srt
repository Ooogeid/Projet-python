1
00:01:48,905 --> 00:01:51,152
- Hey, where's Hotch?
- Budget meeting.

2
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,925
Maybe he'll get us a raise.

3
00:01:52,967 --> 00:01:55,823
They're cutting, not raising.
I just hope they don't take the coffee.

4
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:56,991
I'd quit.

5
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:59,778
Oh, yeah. That'll save
'em like 50 bucks a week.

6
00:02:00,592 --> 00:02:02,205
He'll meet us on the plane.

7
00:02:02,395 --> 00:02:03,648
Where are we going?

8
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,973
Last night, 3 decapitated heads were
found in front of a sheriff's station

9
00:02:07,015 --> 00:02:09,420
in the small border town
of Terlingua, Texas.

10
00:02:09,736 --> 00:02:11,005
3 victims at once?

11
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:15,676
Actually, they appear to be
in different stages of decomposition.

12
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,166
M.E. Confirmed that one
of the heads is a day or so old.

13
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:20,845
The other 2 appear to have
died a few months ago,

14
00:02:20,887 --> 00:02:24,411
but the wound edges suggest
that they were decapitated recently.

15
00:02:24,743 --> 00:02:26,733
Dirt in their mouth, ears, and nose.

16
00:02:26,775 --> 00:02:28,856
At some point,
these two heads were buried.

17
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,210
And then dug up.

18
00:02:30,252 --> 00:02:32,401
Ok, so why the sudden
need to display them?

19
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,946
The need may not be so sudden.

20
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:36,872
Mexico,

21
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,799
in 2009 alone,

22
00:02:39,108 --> 00:02:40,574
10 heads in coolers,

23
00:02:40,616 --> 00:02:42,647
and the people belonging
to these heads

24
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:44,668
were killed just hours
before they were found.

25
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,046
Result of a battle between
feuding drug cartels.

26
00:02:47,088 --> 00:02:49,710
- DEA's not interested?
- They asked us to take a look at it.

27
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:53,130
Considering the different decomposition,
this might not even be about drugs.

28
00:02:53,434 --> 00:02:55,000
Then what do we have?

29
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:58,064
Well, the victims are two males,
one female, so no gender preference.

30
00:02:58,106 --> 00:03:01,050
Staging the heads in front of
a sheriff's station, that's aggressive.

31
00:03:01,092 --> 00:03:02,472
All 3 victims are Hispanic.

32
00:03:02,514 --> 00:03:03,724
And unidentified.

33
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,382
Terlingua has a large
illegal population.

34
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,688
It's made I.D.Ing
the victims that much harder.

35
00:03:09,496 --> 00:03:12,047
He might be trying to make some
type of political statement.

36
00:03:12,089 --> 00:03:14,932
Volunteer border patrols do a lot
of personal policing down there.

37
00:03:15,086 --> 00:03:18,614
Groups like the minutemen prize law
and order above everything else.

38
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,617
And those patrols serve
their political agenda.

39
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,047
Murder would be bad for their image.

40
00:03:24,089 --> 00:03:26,476
Staging the heads in front
of a police station suggests

41
00:03:26,518 --> 00:03:29,446
that the unsub might be local.
He'd have to have a knowledge

42
00:03:29,488 --> 00:03:32,231
about how to do something
like that without being seen.

43
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:35,151
So what we have is hundreds of miles

44
00:03:35,193 --> 00:03:37,094
of unincorporated desert

45
00:03:37,338 --> 00:03:39,729
and an endless supply
of anonymous victims

46
00:03:39,771 --> 00:03:41,484
crossing the border every day.

47
00:03:41,526 --> 00:03:43,657
It's a serial killer's
perfect storm.

48
00:03:51,657 --> 00:04:09,874
Criminal Team
http://experts.heberg-forum.net/

49
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:20,593
Saison 5 - Episode 19
- Rite of Passage -

50
00:04:21,638 --> 00:04:24,350
<i>"A lion's work hours are
only when he's hungry.</i>

51
00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:26,030
<i>Once he's satisfied,</i>

52
00:04:26,072 --> 00:04:28,696
<i>the predator and prey
live peacefully together."</i>

53
00:04:28,738 --> 00:04:29,602
<i>Chuck Jones.</i>

54
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,218
Explain this to me.

55
00:04:31,736 --> 00:04:34,317
The unsub hunts along
the U.S. Mexico border.

56
00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:37,902
- How big is that area?
- Over 5,000 square miles of desert.

57
00:04:38,171 --> 00:04:40,363
He could have gone
undetected for years.

58
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,031
So why announce himself?

59
00:04:42,258 --> 00:04:44,116
Something happened recently.

60
00:04:44,244 --> 00:04:46,285
What do we know
about crime in Terlingua?

61
00:04:46,503 --> 00:04:48,037
It's a stop-over town.

62
00:04:48,156 --> 00:04:50,817
Immigrants stay only 24
hours before moving on,

63
00:04:50,859 --> 00:04:53,614
but that also makes them
narco-trafficking hubs.

64
00:04:53,792 --> 00:04:55,953
Outside of immigration violations,

65
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:57,722
most of the arrests
are drug related.

66
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,715
<i>That, my pretties,
in an understatement.</i>

67
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,718
Anyone familiar with the Lugo cartel
out of Baja California?

68
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,960
Their greatest hits-
the pun being inescapable...

69
00:05:05,002 --> 00:05:06,797
include multiple brutal murders

70
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:09,823
along with importing and distributing
nearly 2 tons of cocaine

71
00:05:09,865 --> 00:05:13,437
and copious amounts
of heroin between 1990 and 2009.

72
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:15,778
Now, if we get in
our bau time machine,

73
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,344
flash forward to now,

74
00:05:17,386 --> 00:05:19,137
a super cheap, hjghly addictive,

75
00:05:19,179 --> 00:05:21,671
and totally impure
form of black tar heroin

76
00:05:21,745 --> 00:05:24,407
just showed up on the streets
of Terlingua, and the DEA

77
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,659
thinks the Lugo cartel
is directly responsible.

78
00:05:26,866 --> 00:05:28,852
So they're expanding
their operation.

79
00:05:28,894 --> 00:05:31,216
Which is often announced
by a wave of violence.

80
00:05:31,258 --> 00:05:33,958
Lugo cartel killed 2
DEA agents last year.

81
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,977
We're going to need
to watch our backs.

82
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:39,282
To cartels, feds are fair game.
There's even usually a bounty, so...

83
00:05:39,324 --> 00:05:40,910
We're going to bring in the toys.

84
00:05:40,952 --> 00:05:43,696
Be careful with those. I don't
need broken MP-5s on our budget.

85
00:05:43,738 --> 00:05:46,339
Guys, here's the thing. I don't think
I technically have authorization

86
00:05:46,381 --> 00:05:48,514
- to carry a weapon like that.
- "You don't."

87
00:05:49,522 --> 00:05:51,716
You know, we're going
to have a victim pool

88
00:05:51,758 --> 00:05:53,853
that is extremely
hesitant to talk to us.

89
00:05:54,107 --> 00:05:56,397
Prentiss, you and Morgan start
with the migrant community,

90
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,823
see what inroads you can make.

91
00:05:57,865 --> 00:06:00,050
Stress that we're only
there to catch a killer.

92
00:06:00,092 --> 00:06:03,220
Rossi and Reid, the M.E.
is waiting to show you the heads.

93
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:06,109
Maybe they can tell us something.

94
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,647
What's this about?

95
00:06:21,303 --> 00:06:23,174
This is part of the Lugo cartel.

96
00:06:34,336 --> 00:06:35,462
Excuse us.

97
00:06:39,696 --> 00:06:41,353
Federal agents. Step aside.

98
00:06:42,149 --> 00:06:45,404
We're legal citizens of this country
demonstrating our first amendment rights

99
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:46,947
to a peaceful assembly,

100
00:06:47,352 --> 00:06:49,241
in order to protest
the unlawful arrest

101
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,832
of Omar Morales.

102
00:06:50,934 --> 00:06:52,244
You walk around us.

103
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:57,500
Agents, sheriff Ruiz
is waiting inside.

104
00:06:57,781 --> 00:06:58,858
Ignore them.

105
00:06:59,829 --> 00:07:01,754
Don't do nothin' stupid, deputies.

106
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:04,723
Anytime you want to make a move,
Jose, you know where to find us.

107
00:07:04,765 --> 00:07:06,073
All y'all do.

108
00:07:10,852 --> 00:07:12,593
Sorry about the welcoming committee.

109
00:07:12,635 --> 00:07:14,736
We didn't expect you
for another half hour.

110
00:07:14,778 --> 00:07:17,361
How many, uh, how many officers
in the whole department?

111
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:20,648
- Including the sheriff, 5.
- There are 8 men outside.

112
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:23,067
And that's the point, right?
To show that they outnumber you.

113
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,696
Well, if it came down to numbers,
we wouldn't stand a chance.

114
00:07:25,738 --> 00:07:29,142
Those scumbags are only a handful of
the soldiers who work for Omar Morales.

115
00:07:29,184 --> 00:07:31,180
He's the head of a local
narco traffic ring.

116
00:07:31,222 --> 00:07:33,572
We picked him up this morning
just outside of town.

117
00:07:33,614 --> 00:07:36,122
- He was headed for the airport.
- Has he made a statement?

118
00:07:38,431 --> 00:07:39,500
Not exactly.

119
00:07:39,764 --> 00:07:40,785
Meaning?

120
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,045
Sheriff Ruiz won't
let us talk to him.

121
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:44,839
And why is that?

122
00:07:44,992 --> 00:07:46,794
Well, maybe you can ask her why.

123
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:48,817
Right this way.

124
00:07:53,059 --> 00:07:54,287
FBI's here.

125
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,371
Eva Ruiz.
I'm glad you could make it.

126
00:07:58,413 --> 00:08:00,236
Agent Hotchner.
This is Agent Jareau.

127
00:08:00,278 --> 00:08:02,338
- Can I get you anything? Coffee?
- No, thank you.

128
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,373
Ma'am, how do you plan on dealing
with the small army outside?

129
00:08:05,415 --> 00:08:06,897
I plan on ignoring them.

130
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:08,279
Well, we can have some of...

131
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:10,424
they'll get hot and tired
and go away on their own.

132
00:08:10,466 --> 00:08:13,045
- They're the least of my worries.
- We heard you made an arrest.

133
00:08:13,087 --> 00:08:14,451
My deputies did.

134
00:08:14,796 --> 00:08:17,477
- But you don't agree?
- Because they're wrong.

135
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,883
Whoever staged these heads
in front of your office

136
00:08:19,925 --> 00:08:22,501
- is trying to tell you something.
- They want me to butt out.

137
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:23,836
Of what, exactly?

138
00:08:25,018 --> 00:08:27,055
I count more than 20
missing immigrants

139
00:08:27,097 --> 00:08:29,154
just in the 6 months
I've been sheriff.

140
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,010
That's more than 3 in a month.

141
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,564
Almost one victim a week.

142
00:08:32,949 --> 00:08:35,172
These are just names
and cursory descriptions.

143
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:36,888
Is there any other paperwork?

144
00:08:37,153 --> 00:08:38,783
Has there been any investigation?

145
00:08:38,825 --> 00:08:40,939
No one will make an official report,

146
00:08:40,981 --> 00:08:44,498
but I believe somebody around here
has been killing for a long time.

147
00:08:45,408 --> 00:08:46,594
Want a laugh?

148
00:08:46,873 --> 00:08:49,422
I left Brooklyn north homicide
to slow down.

149
00:08:49,727 --> 00:08:52,478
I picked the wrong part
of the country to semi-retire.

150
00:08:52,806 --> 00:08:54,809
This place is swimming
in dysfunction.

151
00:08:54,851 --> 00:08:57,328
It's a game of survival,
and I can't trust anyone.

152
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:58,936
Ma'am, you've got 4 deputies.

153
00:08:58,978 --> 00:09:02,150
Who I expressly told to
leave Omar morales alone.

154
00:09:02,232 --> 00:09:04,206
You can see how well
they follow orders.

155
00:09:04,248 --> 00:09:06,366
Then you're sure
this isn't the Lugo cartel?

156
00:09:06,408 --> 00:09:09,393
Murder to send a message
is the way these guys communicate.

157
00:09:09,435 --> 00:09:10,585
Come with me.

158
00:09:16,575 --> 00:09:20,517
You know, contrary to popular belief,
decapitation is not that easy.

159
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:25,096
You don't often hear popular and
decapitation in the same sentence.

160
00:09:25,221 --> 00:09:27,350
You need to strike on the
weakest point of the spine.

161
00:09:27,475 --> 00:09:30,083
It's normally between
the c3 and c7 vertebrae.

162
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:33,272
There are multiple strikes,
but they don't show any hesitation.

163
00:09:33,318 --> 00:09:35,511
I realize you didn't have
much to work with here,

164
00:09:35,636 --> 00:09:36,958
but outside of the obvious,

165
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:38,993
was there anything unusual
about these victims?

166
00:09:39,273 --> 00:09:41,774
Well, the second victim
appeared to have been blind,

167
00:09:41,899 --> 00:09:44,485
if not completely,
then he had cataracts bad enough

168
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,489
that it was difficult
for him to get around.

169
00:09:46,614 --> 00:09:47,877
What about the other two?

170
00:09:48,002 --> 00:09:48,699
No.

171
00:09:49,108 --> 00:09:52,606
The most recent victim is older.
So is the first one, the woman.

172
00:09:52,731 --> 00:09:55,164
Well, I only had
their teeth to go by,

173
00:09:55,289 --> 00:09:57,333
so it would take some time
to get an accurate age,

174
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:59,138
but, yeah, I'd agree.
They were older.

175
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:03,339
We're looking for something
that we call a signature.

176
00:10:03,464 --> 00:10:05,398
Something that all
the victims shared,

177
00:10:05,681 --> 00:10:08,801
some physical mark,
something postmortem.

178
00:10:09,207 --> 00:10:11,514
Well, I don't know if
this is what you mean,

179
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:14,529
but they all had sand residue
in their noses and throats.

180
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,442
Could that be from being buried?

181
00:10:16,748 --> 00:10:19,145
Possibly. But the trachea
and the nasal passage,

182
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,701
they were kind of torn up.

183
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,412
If I had the lungs here,

184
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:24,539
I'd guess that they were
full of sand as well.

185
00:10:24,785 --> 00:10:26,753
You mean like they breathed in sand?

186
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:29,377
Forcefully enough that it
lacerated the passages.

187
00:10:30,555 --> 00:10:31,758
They were running.

188
00:10:36,673 --> 00:10:38,583
This is Agent Hotchner from the FBI.

189
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:41,506
Nice suit.

190
00:10:46,597 --> 00:10:49,176
You know how much misery
that guy is responsible for?

191
00:10:50,096 --> 00:10:52,818
Yeah, I've heard some of the
things this cartel's capable of.

192
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,145
Your boss gonna talk to him?

193
00:10:56,438 --> 00:10:57,469
He's gonna try.

194
00:10:58,738 --> 00:10:59,797
Good luck.

195
00:11:01,985 --> 00:11:03,656
What kind of message is this?

196
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,741
It's funny?

197
00:11:09,038 --> 00:11:10,111
Kind of, yeah.

198
00:11:10,404 --> 00:11:12,208
A competitor moves
in on your business,

199
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,733
is that what you would do?

200
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,344
Hypothetically?

201
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:21,146
Yeah.

202
00:11:24,021 --> 00:11:25,558
I'd gut him from crotch to chin,

203
00:11:26,809 --> 00:11:29,081
then leave his intestines
open for the animals,

204
00:11:29,806 --> 00:11:31,727
after I sent his left
hand to his wife,

205
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,652
his eyes to his mother,

206
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:36,031
and his tongue to his kids,

207
00:11:36,718 --> 00:11:39,589
with a note saying that their
papa had died wetting himself.

208
00:11:41,136 --> 00:11:42,167
A coward.

209
00:11:45,199 --> 00:11:46,990
This, this ain't no message.

210
00:11:48,202 --> 00:11:49,471
Hypothetically.

211
00:11:50,571 --> 00:11:53,137
That's an interesting defense,
saying that you would do worse.

212
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,020
A defense?
You asked me a question.

213
00:11:55,109 --> 00:11:57,156
You think I need a defense,
charge me with something.

214
00:11:57,194 --> 00:11:58,649
What do you know about the heads

215
00:11:58,724 --> 00:12:01,175
that were left outside the
sheriff's station last night?

216
00:12:02,307 --> 00:12:03,307
Seriously?

217
00:12:03,827 --> 00:12:05,944
You're a man who likes
to be in control.

218
00:12:06,057 --> 00:12:08,130
You have a small army
standing guard outside.

219
00:12:08,608 --> 00:12:11,382
They protect you because
you've convinced them somehow that

220
00:12:11,466 --> 00:12:14,777
They need you, and you don't know
what's going on in your town?

221
00:12:16,037 --> 00:12:17,675
You didn't tell him?

222
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:19,154
Tell me what?

223
00:12:20,984 --> 00:12:22,838
You're looking for Santa muerte.

224
00:12:25,026 --> 00:12:26,378
The Saint of death.

225
00:12:30,504 --> 00:12:32,330
Sheriff, what exactly
is Omar talking about?

226
00:12:32,622 --> 00:12:34,657
Every job has a patron Saint.

227
00:12:34,782 --> 00:12:36,088
Cops have Saint jude,

228
00:12:36,417 --> 00:12:38,172
doctors have Raphael the archangel.

229
00:12:38,701 --> 00:12:40,541
But if you're a drug
dealer or a killer,

230
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:41,740
who do you pray to?

231
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:43,094
The Saint of death.

232
00:12:44,137 --> 00:12:46,508
I've learned that crossing
the desert to get here,

233
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:48,304
you lose track of the
ways you can die.

234
00:12:48,429 --> 00:12:50,104
So if someone close doesn't make it,

235
00:12:50,229 --> 00:12:52,729
sometimes it's easier to
blame a superstitious figure.

236
00:12:52,847 --> 00:12:55,162
Well, Omar doesn't seem like
he believes what he's saying.

237
00:12:55,287 --> 00:12:56,645
I didn't say he believes it.

238
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,318
I said it's who people are blaming.

239
00:12:58,826 --> 00:12:59,826
What people?

240
00:13:00,052 --> 00:13:02,204
Look, Santa muerte has been
coming up more and more.

241
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:05,617
The illegals I send back.
The coyotes I arrest.

242
00:13:05,896 --> 00:13:08,328
Some of the drug traffickers,
they're afraid.

243
00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:09,746
Afraid of a Saint?

244
00:13:11,238 --> 00:13:12,494
I handled a homicide once

245
00:13:12,619 --> 00:13:14,964
where my only witness was
this 4-year-old girl.

246
00:13:15,263 --> 00:13:17,587
And she told me her mom and
dad got killed by a dragon.

247
00:13:18,396 --> 00:13:21,829
Turns out the bad guy wore a green
rain suit with a pointy hood.

248
00:13:22,377 --> 00:13:23,885
To the kid it looked like a dragon.

249
00:13:24,952 --> 00:13:27,843
So when hundreds of people are
talking about the same monster,

250
00:13:27,968 --> 00:13:29,578
it's a sure bet
something's going on.

251
00:13:29,703 --> 00:13:31,656
They just don't know
what to call it.

252
00:13:31,698 --> 00:13:33,170
So they call it Santa muerte.

253
00:14:30,218 --> 00:14:32,367
I told you we should have
kept that bastard locked up.

254
00:14:32,492 --> 00:14:35,811
And I'm telling you for the last time,
Boyd, go back on patrol.

255
00:14:37,191 --> 00:14:39,803
No decomposition.
It's a new victim.

256
00:14:39,928 --> 00:14:42,497
He's becoming more
focused on you, sheriff.

257
00:14:42,622 --> 00:14:44,474
Sheriff, may I have a word with you?

258
00:14:44,599 --> 00:14:46,576
It's clear that this is personal.

259
00:14:46,701 --> 00:14:47,969
It always was.

260
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,276
How's that?

261
00:14:49,401 --> 00:14:51,561
Look, I have no idea how
many of these people

262
00:14:51,686 --> 00:14:54,743
have gone missing over the years,
but one thing is clear.

263
00:14:54,868 --> 00:14:56,632
I'm the only one who
seems to give a damn.

264
00:14:56,669 --> 00:14:58,293
That's as personal
as it gets for me.

265
00:14:58,359 --> 00:15:00,068
We're here because we care.

266
00:15:00,773 --> 00:15:01,632
Well...

267
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:04,999
All I've got is a bunch of
stories and superstitions.

268
00:15:05,245 --> 00:15:06,715
What if it isn't even happening?

269
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:08,967
Sheriff, I can't tell you how
long this has been going on,

270
00:15:09,092 --> 00:15:11,110
but something's
definitely happening now.

271
00:15:11,568 --> 00:15:13,160
And from the way the
unsub is acting,

272
00:15:13,285 --> 00:15:15,359
it's obvious that
you've touched a nerve.

273
00:15:15,805 --> 00:15:17,916
Whoever he is, I think you've
probably talked to him.

274
00:15:17,957 --> 00:15:19,769
I've talked to anyone
who will listen.

275
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:22,235
Drug dealers, immigrants,
business owners...

276
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,165
well, one of them is
your Santa muerte,

277
00:15:24,501 --> 00:15:26,996
and he's feeling the pressure.
When we get back to the station,

278
00:15:27,121 --> 00:15:29,471
I want to go over every
single interview you've done.

279
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,790
How? Who are we even looking for?

280
00:15:31,915 --> 00:15:33,890
We have a profile to give
you and your deputies.

281
00:15:34,882 --> 00:15:37,907
We're searching for a personality
type called a human predator...

282
00:15:38,032 --> 00:15:39,729
in the classic sense, a hunter.

283
00:15:39,968 --> 00:15:42,979
All the victims we've been
able to conclusively tie to him

284
00:15:43,104 --> 00:15:44,866
have been older or
handicapped in some way.

285
00:15:45,234 --> 00:15:48,154
This suggests he waits for someone
to separate from the pack,

286
00:15:48,418 --> 00:15:49,629
looks for the weakest.

287
00:15:49,676 --> 00:15:50,999
Like a lion or something.

288
00:15:51,124 --> 00:15:54,411
Except a lion hunts food.
This type of predator hunts power.

289
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,995
It's not about serving a need,

290
00:15:56,184 --> 00:15:57,807
and everything is a
means to that end.

291
00:15:57,835 --> 00:16:00,229
We also believe that he makes his
victims run through the desert

292
00:16:00,267 --> 00:16:01,488
in order to weaken them.

293
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:03,967
He may not be capable of taking
them on in their strongest state,

294
00:16:04,092 --> 00:16:05,627
despite their age or infirmity.

295
00:16:05,961 --> 00:16:08,771
This suggests that he's possibly
handicapped in some way himself.

296
00:16:08,896 --> 00:16:11,219
Certainly weak,
maybe small or even thin.

297
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,804
And an unsub who creates
chaos and then attacks

298
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:16,197
typically carries this through
to all aspects of his life.

299
00:16:16,322 --> 00:16:17,963
He's unlikely to be
in a relationship.

300
00:16:18,088 --> 00:16:21,229
If he is, it's an abusive one.
This guy gets off on control.

301
00:16:21,268 --> 00:16:23,492
He will have tried to stay very
close to the investigation.

302
00:16:23,512 --> 00:16:24,929
He's well aware that the sheriff

303
00:16:24,938 --> 00:16:26,976
has started looking into the
missing illegal immigrants.

304
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:28,130
How do you know that?

305
00:16:28,186 --> 00:16:31,160
It's probably why the decapitations
started, as a countermeasure.

306
00:16:31,285 --> 00:16:33,163
He's trying to throw
off the investigation.

307
00:16:33,288 --> 00:16:35,652
It's typical in an organized
offender like this.

308
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,662
Cary stayner, the yosemite killer,

309
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:39,969
drove more than 50 miles
to dump cigarette packs

310
00:16:40,094 --> 00:16:42,667
and driver's licenses at
intersections to throw off suspicion.

311
00:16:42,712 --> 00:16:44,881
Start by looking back at
everyone you've talked to

312
00:16:44,927 --> 00:16:46,458
in connection with these killings.

313
00:16:46,501 --> 00:16:47,853
We need to start with people

314
00:16:47,902 --> 00:16:49,713
who are familiar with
the immigrant journey.

315
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,354
Like who? Advocates? None of
them will talk to us. I've tried.

316
00:16:52,415 --> 00:16:54,238
Well, the coyotes
want this guy caught.

317
00:16:54,363 --> 00:16:55,664
He's hurting their business.

318
00:16:55,789 --> 00:16:58,121
And if the advocates really
care about the immigrants,

319
00:16:58,246 --> 00:17:00,477
they're gonna want to find
whoever is responsible as well.

320
00:17:00,682 --> 00:17:02,155
There's one guy who could help.

321
00:17:02,568 --> 00:17:04,731
He runs an outreach
program called libertad.

322
00:17:05,056 --> 00:17:06,191
Where can we find him?

323
00:17:06,978 --> 00:17:10,132
Clyde, you want to take them
over to meet Richard corral?

324
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:14,163
My lucky day.

325
00:17:22,993 --> 00:17:24,834
These FBI agents
want a word with you.

326
00:17:26,407 --> 00:17:27,407
See the limp?

327
00:17:35,394 --> 00:17:37,639
Hey, baby girl, I need you to
run a check on someone for me.

328
00:17:37,947 --> 00:17:40,997
What is wrong with you, Clyde?
None of my clients will trust me

329
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,954
if I've got federal agents
walking around here.

330
00:17:43,001 --> 00:17:44,729
Well, maybe you shouldn't
spend your time

331
00:17:44,776 --> 00:17:46,720
helping illegals sneak
into the country.

332
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:49,693
They only want a better life. Well, then
they ought to come in the front door.

333
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:51,531
Uh, gentlemen, another day?

334
00:17:53,944 --> 00:17:56,112
Mr. Corral,
we understand your hesitation,

335
00:17:56,595 --> 00:17:58,953
but we aren't here about immigration,
we're here about murder.

336
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,683
Do you know anything about the heads

337
00:18:00,808 --> 00:18:03,417
that were left in front of the
sheriff's station a few days ago?

338
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:05,792
Everyone does.
My clients are terrified.

339
00:18:06,122 --> 00:18:07,044
Clients.

340
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,169
Deputy...

341
00:18:09,527 --> 00:18:12,340
Another man was murdered last night.
An immigrant.

342
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:15,501
We need to figure out
how this man finds his victims.

343
00:18:15,621 --> 00:18:17,251
Sheriff Ruiz said you know

344
00:18:17,371 --> 00:18:19,459
more about these people's
journey than anyone.

345
00:18:20,828 --> 00:18:22,929
How many places are
there to cross?

346
00:18:23,408 --> 00:18:25,095
For every tunnel we find,

347
00:18:25,215 --> 00:18:27,006
there's 12 more we
don't know about.

348
00:18:27,371 --> 00:18:28,869
And once they've made it?

349
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:31,071
Runners keep documents in
the trunks of their cars.

350
00:18:31,072 --> 00:18:34,238
Passports, fake social
security numbers, green cards.

351
00:18:34,358 --> 00:18:35,776
It's a big business.

352
00:18:35,777 --> 00:18:37,210
Especially in border towns.

353
00:18:37,211 --> 00:18:38,779
Do you know these runners?

354
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,781
They change all the time.

355
00:18:40,782 --> 00:18:43,049
If immigrants don't find you,
where do they go?

356
00:18:43,585 --> 00:18:44,851
Safe houses.

357
00:18:44,852 --> 00:18:47,087
It's supposed to be where
they can find rest,

358
00:18:47,098 --> 00:18:48,293
water, food.

359
00:18:48,523 --> 00:18:49,756
Supposed to be?

360
00:18:49,757 --> 00:18:51,391
It's more like a prison,

361
00:18:51,392 --> 00:18:53,727
until their families can
pay off the coyotes.

362
00:18:53,728 --> 00:18:55,428
Where are these safe houses?

363
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:57,274
Are you kidding?

364
00:18:57,394 --> 00:18:59,733
They come and go faster
than the tunnels.

365
00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:03,770
Ok. Thank you for your time.

366
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,127
Sheriff, we could use a hand
with the geographical profile.

367
00:19:19,247 --> 00:19:21,387
We're trying to locate
likely safe houses.

368
00:19:21,836 --> 00:19:24,124
Your team travels all
around the country, right?

369
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,292
That's right.

370
00:19:25,293 --> 00:19:28,395
My last year in homicide,
I handled 36 murders.

371
00:19:28,396 --> 00:19:30,964
I was one of 20
detectives in my unit.

372
00:19:30,965 --> 00:19:32,866
Do the math.

373
00:19:34,335 --> 00:19:36,603
Don't ask me how many I solved.

374
00:19:36,604 --> 00:19:38,538
I'm sure you did
the best you could.

375
00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:41,072
There really isn't anywhere to go

376
00:19:41,192 --> 00:19:43,577
where people aren't killing
each other, is there?

377
00:19:43,578 --> 00:19:45,241
Likely safe houses?

378
00:19:45,495 --> 00:19:47,457
Even if we could
find a safe house,

379
00:19:47,703 --> 00:19:50,584
you really think someone who
just crossed is gonna talk to us?

380
00:19:50,585 --> 00:19:52,152
Well, there's a good chance

381
00:19:52,194 --> 00:19:54,969
that last night's victim didn't cross
alone. Someone may be missing him.

382
00:19:54,989 --> 00:19:57,025
If last night's illegals
are still at safe houses,

383
00:19:57,044 --> 00:19:59,758
we can find the route they used and
we'll know the unsub's hunting grounds.

384
00:19:59,878 --> 00:20:02,281
The whole point of a safe
house is it's a secret.

385
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:04,332
If I'd could find them,
I'd shut them down.

386
00:20:04,895 --> 00:20:06,470
All right, if it's a first stop,

387
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:09,336
we should start with homes
that are closest to the border.

388
00:20:09,337 --> 00:20:11,571
I could pull land deeds.
Might take a while.

389
00:20:11,572 --> 00:20:13,206
We've got something faster.

390
00:20:13,207 --> 00:20:14,674
- Garcia.
- Sir.

391
00:20:14,675 --> 00:20:17,142
We're looking for illegal immigrant
safe houses in terlingua.

392
00:20:17,143 --> 00:20:18,463
What are the parameters?

393
00:20:18,505 --> 00:20:20,881
Start with homeowners and
renters with criminal records.

394
00:20:20,882 --> 00:20:22,294
That's a start.
Give me more.

395
00:20:22,336 --> 00:20:24,618
Morgan said they're always moving.
Look for homes

396
00:20:24,619 --> 00:20:26,850
with short-term leases.
And spikes in utilities.

397
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:29,857
If they're housing illegals, there'll be
a higher usage of power and water.

398
00:20:30,681 --> 00:20:32,911
I'm crossing with all
Texas utility companies.

399
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:36,610
And I have 3. And I just sent
the addresses to your phones.

400
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:37,739
Thanks, Garcia.

401
00:20:37,773 --> 00:20:39,499
If you're looking for
a gift to get me,

402
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,301
one of her would be
greatly appreciated.

403
00:20:41,302 --> 00:20:43,169
We're pretty sure
they broke the mold.

404
00:20:48,309 --> 00:20:50,477
You know, we're not
going to get very far

405
00:20:50,478 --> 00:20:52,454
if you keep arguing about
illegals with everyone.

406
00:20:52,488 --> 00:20:53,921
This place used to be different.

407
00:20:53,933 --> 00:20:55,962
- How do you mean?
- I don't know.

408
00:20:56,695 --> 00:20:57,751
Different.

409
00:20:58,586 --> 00:20:59,819
Got it, sir.

410
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,945
We're gonna split up
possible safe houses.

411
00:21:02,065 --> 00:21:04,257
The closest one to us
is 10 minutes from here.

412
00:21:04,258 --> 00:21:05,959
They ain't gonna
be happy to see us.

413
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,718
- You got a cell phone?
- Yeah.

414
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,059
Give me the number.

415
00:21:09,163 --> 00:21:12,332
Deputy, we're at the back door.
Go ahead and knock.

416
00:21:15,002 --> 00:21:18,004
Police! Open up!

417
00:21:24,612 --> 00:21:25,645
Nice.

418
00:21:25,646 --> 00:21:27,777
I played a little strong
safety in college.

419
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,416
No idea what that means.

420
00:21:29,417 --> 00:21:31,584
FBI. We got a few
questions for you.

421
00:21:31,585 --> 00:21:32,953
No hablo ingles.

422
00:21:33,831 --> 00:21:36,957
FBI. Tenemos algunas preguntas.

423
00:21:41,696 --> 00:21:43,086
In here?

424
00:21:43,731 --> 00:21:45,165
You keep them in a stable?

425
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:46,199
You got him?

426
00:21:49,143 --> 00:21:49,799
Go.

427
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:12,225
Esta bien.

428
00:22:14,968 --> 00:22:16,029
Mi mama.

429
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,731
El hombre se la llevo.

430
00:22:17,732 --> 00:22:19,232
Estaba llorando.

431
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:20,734
His mother.

432
00:22:30,845 --> 00:22:31,910
Prentiss.

433
00:22:39,729 --> 00:22:41,955
Por favor.

434
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:49,603
Gentry! We need backup
and medical units!

435
00:22:49,723 --> 00:22:50,928
Esta bien, querida.

436
00:22:51,132 --> 00:22:52,371
Esta bien.

437
00:22:55,089 --> 00:22:56,031
Gracias.

438
00:23:00,702 --> 00:23:02,254
Now, you listen to me.

439
00:23:02,843 --> 00:23:05,443
If you don't want to talk to me,
that's fine.

440
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:07,480
I don't care.

441
00:23:07,863 --> 00:23:10,595
But you're facing rape,
kidnapping,

442
00:23:10,715 --> 00:23:13,219
weapons charges, and numerous
counts of federal conspiracy

443
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,256
to smuggle and harbor
illegal aliens.

444
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,828
This is your last chance to
help yourself, my friend.

445
00:23:23,597 --> 00:23:24,898
He doesn't look concerned.

446
00:23:25,018 --> 00:23:27,835
It's because the whole
border situation is chaos.

447
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:30,312
He has as much chance
of just getting deported

448
00:23:30,432 --> 00:23:31,976
as he does of doing prison time.

449
00:23:32,256 --> 00:23:35,170
I'll make some calls, see if I
can pull some federal strings.

450
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,877
Who's gonna pull the
strings when you go home?

451
00:23:56,372 --> 00:23:58,531
Her husband was sick
and he stayed behind.

452
00:23:59,014 --> 00:24:00,567
Just like the others.

453
00:24:27,995 --> 00:24:29,762
Can he have soda?

454
00:24:29,763 --> 00:24:31,485
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

455
00:24:31,605 --> 00:24:34,634
Come on, big man,
let's get a soda.

456
00:24:53,879 --> 00:24:55,513
I thought I sent you
home an hour ago.

457
00:24:55,633 --> 00:24:56,890
Something's bugging me.

458
00:24:56,891 --> 00:24:59,095
That young boy says he
remembers seeing the sun

459
00:24:59,137 --> 00:25:00,416
when he crossed the border.

460
00:25:00,421 --> 00:25:01,561
They crossed at night.

461
00:25:01,562 --> 00:25:03,229
Yeah, I know. It got me thinking.

462
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:05,765
There's a big mural on
the side of an old barn.

463
00:25:05,766 --> 00:25:07,167
It's of the sun.

464
00:25:08,026 --> 00:25:09,002
How far out?

465
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,817
About 15 minutes.

466
00:25:12,137 --> 00:25:13,283
Want to take a ride?

467
00:25:13,293 --> 00:25:14,474
Sure.

468
00:25:27,121 --> 00:25:29,088
Don't think I've
been out this way.

469
00:25:29,089 --> 00:25:31,357
I used to ride out
here when I was a kid.

470
00:25:31,641 --> 00:25:32,654
Horses?

471
00:25:33,181 --> 00:25:34,221
Atvs.

472
00:25:34,974 --> 00:25:36,290
Never been on one of those.

473
00:25:36,297 --> 00:25:37,897
Yeah, you gotta be
careful with them.

474
00:25:37,922 --> 00:25:39,713
You can wreck pretty good.

475
00:25:39,833 --> 00:25:42,183
Growing up, all I
ever had was a bicycle

476
00:25:42,233 --> 00:25:44,829
if I could keep it long enough
before it got stolen to ride it.

477
00:25:44,949 --> 00:25:46,885
Good reason to hate
the city, right?

478
00:25:47,644 --> 00:25:48,740
One of them.

479
00:25:50,013 --> 00:25:51,244
There.

480
00:25:53,021 --> 00:25:55,712
It looks a lot like
the kid described.

481
00:25:58,219 --> 00:26:01,654
Santa muerte and the sun.

482
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,125
That's good police work, Boyd.

483
00:26:10,053 --> 00:26:13,733
Hey, what do you think about
that profile the FBI gave?

484
00:26:13,915 --> 00:26:15,031
What do I think?

485
00:26:15,669 --> 00:26:18,504
He may not be capable of taking
them on in their strongest state,

486
00:26:18,505 --> 00:26:20,306
despite their age or infirmity.

487
00:26:20,626 --> 00:26:22,771
They said the guy was a coward.

488
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,413
Anyone kills that many people
has gotta be a real bad-ass.

489
00:26:27,414 --> 00:26:28,604
Well, where I come from,

490
00:26:28,724 --> 00:26:31,818
preying on people who can't defend
themselves makes him a punk-ass.

491
00:26:31,938 --> 00:26:33,519
A coward.

492
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,350
Putting a man's head
outside your house

493
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,023
hardly seems like a coward.

494
00:26:42,396 --> 00:26:44,397
Something wrong
with your leg, Boyd?

495
00:26:44,398 --> 00:26:47,505
Yeah, I busted it up pretty
bad when I was a teenager.

496
00:26:48,415 --> 00:26:49,969
Can't hardly run anymore.

497
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:52,905
Ooh, it hurts like a bitch
every time it's gonna rain now.

498
00:26:52,906 --> 00:26:55,308
He's possibly handicapped
in some way himself.

499
00:26:55,309 --> 00:26:58,111
Certainly weak.
Maybe small or even thin.

500
00:26:58,112 --> 00:27:00,913
I didn't know you had a bad leg.

501
00:27:02,195 --> 00:27:04,164
You didn't know anything about me.

502
00:27:04,313 --> 00:27:05,388
Excuse me?

503
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:07,764
You just came from new
York and took over,

504
00:27:08,055 --> 00:27:11,357
sticking your nose in things
that were going just fine.

505
00:27:11,358 --> 00:27:13,359
You're talking about the missings?

506
00:27:14,395 --> 00:27:15,728
The missing.

507
00:27:15,729 --> 00:27:18,331
Now, how could someone be missing

508
00:27:18,332 --> 00:27:21,601
if they ain't supposed to be
here in the first damn place?

509
00:27:26,473 --> 00:27:29,575
They're gonna blame
it all on Omar.

510
00:27:30,878 --> 00:27:33,079
I can get rid of
that son of a bitch

511
00:27:33,671 --> 00:27:34,865
and you.

512
00:27:36,173 --> 00:27:37,116
Why, Boyd?

513
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:39,991
Why?

514
00:27:40,606 --> 00:27:41,659
Why not?

515
00:27:44,769 --> 00:27:46,526
You won't make it.

516
00:27:46,927 --> 00:27:48,261
I gotta try.

517
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:49,796
Yeah, I know.

518
00:28:05,865 --> 00:28:07,311
Where are all the deputies?

519
00:28:07,431 --> 00:28:08,964
Maybe they found another head.

520
00:28:08,965 --> 00:28:11,945
No, the sheriff would have contacted us.
Have you heard from her this morning?

521
00:28:11,987 --> 00:28:14,093
No, sir, I wasn't
expecting to, though.

522
00:28:14,585 --> 00:28:16,372
Jj, come with me.

523
00:28:19,376 --> 00:28:20,882
10-4, unit 3.

524
00:28:20,924 --> 00:28:22,545
Keep us posted on your progress.

525
00:28:22,546 --> 00:28:23,813
What's going on?

526
00:28:23,814 --> 00:28:25,484
It's the sheriff. She's missing.

527
00:28:25,604 --> 00:28:27,458
She never came in this morning.

528
00:28:27,578 --> 00:28:30,416
Her cruiser's missing, too.
The whole department's looking for her.

529
00:28:30,437 --> 00:28:32,685
Did she say anything to you?
Was she working on something?

530
00:28:32,727 --> 00:28:34,535
She was gone before we
left here last night.

531
00:28:34,577 --> 00:28:36,412
- Gone where?
- I thought she went home.

532
00:28:36,454 --> 00:28:39,354
Have Garcia trace her cell phone. See if
she had any incoming calls last night.

533
00:28:39,396 --> 00:28:41,594
This is Boyd.
Oh, God.

534
00:28:41,731 --> 00:28:42,898
I found her.

535
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:44,866
God, she's all...

536
00:28:45,909 --> 00:28:47,331
Just get me some help.

537
00:28:47,451 --> 00:28:48,515
Hurry.

538
00:28:49,673 --> 00:28:50,673
Deputy.

539
00:28:50,674 --> 00:28:51,604
What he did...

540
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:52,788
It's the sheriff?

541
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,524
Yeah. Yeah, it's her.

542
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,080
This isn't the same.

543
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:07,370
This is angry.

544
00:29:07,538 --> 00:29:08,746
And overkill.

545
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,498
It's a completely different MO.

546
00:29:11,105 --> 00:29:12,458
And a new victimology.

547
00:29:13,129 --> 00:29:15,461
He goes from impossible to identify

548
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:18,324
illegal immigrants
to a law enforcement officer?

549
00:29:19,672 --> 00:29:22,134
We're profiling a guy who picks
on the weakest in a crowd.

550
00:29:22,555 --> 00:29:25,221
I didn't know her that well, but weak
doesn't seem to fit the sheriff.

551
00:29:25,461 --> 00:29:26,639
It's also not random.

552
00:29:27,207 --> 00:29:27,973
How so?

553
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:31,102
It's what Omar Morales said
he would do to a body to send a message.

554
00:29:31,414 --> 00:29:32,937
He'd tear someone up like that?

555
00:29:33,207 --> 00:29:35,305
That's exactly
what he said he would do.

556
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:37,108
The evisceration, hand, the tongue.

557
00:29:38,211 --> 00:29:41,281
He told Ruiz and I when we first came
into the interrogation room.

558
00:29:41,973 --> 00:29:43,848
- We're the evidence team.
- Right there.

559
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,162
Is it her?

560
00:29:50,545 --> 00:29:51,664
What's left of her.

561
00:29:51,975 --> 00:29:53,416
Is there anything in the car?

562
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:55,854
Nothing that would indicate
where she was headed last night.

563
00:29:55,979 --> 00:29:57,775
There's no notebooks, no log.

564
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:00,342
Her body is mutilated in exactly
the way that Omar Morales,

565
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:02,633
the drug trafficker,
said he would mutilate a body.

566
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:05,553
We did profile the unsub would be
someone close to the investigation.

567
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,471
But only Ruiz
and I heard him say it.

568
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,363
So Omar looks good for this?

569
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:13,231
{\Except}Why would he kill the one person in
town who didn't think he was the unsub?

570
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,730
Garcia says there's no activity
on the sheriff's cell past 9 P.M.

571
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:19,608
Does anybody remember who was at
the station last night when we arrived?

572
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:20,687
The station?

573
00:30:20,812 --> 00:30:22,903
The sheriff's body was
mutilated exactly the way

574
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,754
the drug trafficker
said he would do it.

575
00:30:24,879 --> 00:30:26,365
All of it?
The tongue, too?

576
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:27,616
You heard that?

577
00:30:28,579 --> 00:30:31,787
I was at the window when you were talking
to him. There was a speaker on the wall.

578
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,442
Was anybody else there?

579
00:30:33,993 --> 00:30:35,124
Yeah, deputy Boyd.

580
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,374
Deputy gannon, where's deputy Boyd?

581
00:30:37,499 --> 00:30:39,628
- Him and gentry went to pick him up.
- Pick up who

582
00:30:40,081 --> 00:30:41,276
Omar Morales.

583
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,206
How do you want to play this?

584
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,240
Don't do something stupid, Jose.

585
00:31:09,513 --> 00:31:11,160
Take it easy.
We can work this out.

586
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,736
Boyd! What the hell are you doing?

587
00:31:26,936 --> 00:31:28,506
This ain't gonna stick, you know.

588
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,231
Ronny, what did you do?

589
00:31:49,922 --> 00:31:51,024
He had a gun.

590
00:31:51,973 --> 00:31:52,747
What?

591
00:31:53,743 --> 00:31:54,703
He had a gun.

592
00:31:55,243 --> 00:31:56,754
Ronny, he ain't got no gun.

593
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:58,571
I had to shoot him.

594
00:31:59,743 --> 00:32:00,876
He killed two cops.

595
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:02,586
What?

596
00:32:27,978 --> 00:32:31,740
Gentry, this is Agent Prentiss. If he's
near you, please don't say anything.

597
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:34,224
<i>We think the unsub
may be deputy Boyd.</i>

598
00:32:36,769 --> 00:32:37,953
Are you there?

599
00:32:49,391 --> 00:32:51,747
- Reid, JJ, stay here and stay alert.
- Yeah.

600
00:33:14,009 --> 00:33:14,950
It's gentry.

601
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:26,795
Does this look legit to you?

602
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,464
Omar took shotgun hits.

603
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:30,378
Gentry only has a pistol.

604
00:33:30,993 --> 00:33:33,501
There's no powder residue
on Omar's hands, either.

605
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:34,778
Oh, my God.

606
00:33:35,142 --> 00:33:36,221
What if he heard me?

607
00:33:37,017 --> 00:33:39,141
- Gannon, where would Boyd go?
- I don't know.

608
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:42,019
This is no time to be covering up.
He killed your boss and gentry.

609
00:33:42,338 --> 00:33:45,648
I'm not covering. I don't know the guy
that well. No one does. He's a loner.

610
00:33:47,295 --> 00:33:48,275
My liege.

611
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:51,403
Deputy Boyd is our unsub.
He has a police radio. Can yotrack it?

612
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:54,074
- Yeah. What's his unit number?
- Call the sheriff's station.

613
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:57,218
- The serial number from the dispatcher.
- OK, I'll get back to you.

614
00:33:57,921 --> 00:34:00,663
- We profiled him as a hunter.
- Well, now he's the hunted.

615
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:03,707
- He'll go someplace he feels safe.
- Some place he knows he can control.

616
00:34:04,015 --> 00:34:06,043
- Home?
- No, I think a preplanned location.

617
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:09,463
Sir, I've got him.
He's heading northbound.

618
00:34:09,894 --> 00:34:11,965
- Interstate?
- No, he is not on a road at all.

619
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,468
- He's driving through the desert.
- Keep tracking him.

620
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:15,511
He's running.

621
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,159
Not home for sure.
He lives in a trailer out West of town.

622
00:34:18,284 --> 00:34:19,608
So where's he running to?

623
00:34:19,733 --> 00:34:22,559
Morgan, Prentiss, Reid, deputy, you take
to his house, see what you can find.

624
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:23,856
I need your radio.

625
00:34:24,299 --> 00:34:26,420
- What are you gonna do?
- Keep him busy.

626
00:34:28,904 --> 00:34:31,610
Deputy Boyd,
this is Agent Hotchner with the FBI.

627
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:34,201
I know you can hear me.
You have no place to go.

628
00:34:34,693 --> 00:34:36,134
This is my desert.

629
00:34:36,259 --> 00:34:38,162
You think you can find me out here,

630
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:40,035
yeah, well, come on out.

631
00:34:40,339 --> 00:34:41,756
Cocky little bastard.

632
00:34:41,881 --> 00:34:44,081
Is he's right. We don't know
anything about this desert.

633
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:45,708
Hope they can find something.

634
00:35:01,928 --> 00:35:04,435
- We're definitely in the rig place.
- Just breathe through your nose

635
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:07,931
Normal. Smell is the weakest sense. In
few minutes, you won't even notice it.

636
00:35:08,056 --> 00:35:11,365
- What about the taste?
- I think that's in your head.

637
00:35:12,209 --> 00:35:15,085
All right, spread out. Let's find
out where this guy's headed here.

638
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:18,252
Boyd, this doesn't have to end
any worse than it already is.

639
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,534
- <i>Is that right?</i>
- Turn yourself in.

640
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:23,287
- I'll tell the judge you cooperated.
- This is Texas, Agent.

641
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,881
<i>You think the judge gives a damn
whether or not someone cooperated</i>

642
00:35:26,006 --> 00:35:27,949
<i>when he's handing out
the death penalty?</i>

643
00:35:28,074 --> 00:35:29,848
Now, don't get me wrong.

644
00:35:30,762 --> 00:35:32,546
I wouldn't have it any other way.

645
00:35:33,724 --> 00:35:36,049
That's the only way to
deal with someone like me.

646
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:38,927
Think he's suicidal?

647
00:35:39,455 --> 00:35:40,512
Or he's bluffing.

648
00:35:41,224 --> 00:35:43,682
- What's north of here?
- A whole lot of nothing.

649
00:35:44,048 --> 00:35:45,225
He's not panicking.

650
00:35:45,864 --> 00:35:48,194
There's something out there,
and he's headed for it.

651
00:35:52,806 --> 00:35:55,525
I found where the source
of that smell is coming from.

652
00:36:03,907 --> 00:36:06,052
This is where he decapitated them.

653
00:36:07,247 --> 00:36:08,653
Guys, come look at this.

654
00:36:09,368 --> 00:36:12,356
I'm ready for that smell weakness
to kick in anytime, Reid.

655
00:36:13,587 --> 00:36:15,825
Listen.
"Golden harvest grain and feed

656
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:18,181
"suffered another setback
today in a ruling over

657
00:36:18,306 --> 00:36:20,385
"the death of foreman fred Boyd."

658
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,931
"Boyd survived by his son Ronald."

659
00:36:24,347 --> 00:36:27,893
Didn't the last victim's child say
that he saw the sun when he crossed?

660
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:29,686
- Yeah.
- Golden harvest,

661
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,104
that's out north of town.

662
00:36:46,084 --> 00:36:48,121
Sir, I lost him.
The signal's gone.

663
00:36:48,779 --> 00:36:50,040
He smashed the radio.

664
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:53,382
Garcia, I need a satellite photo of
the last place that the signal showed.

665
00:36:53,507 --> 00:36:55,546
There's something out there
that's not on the map.

666
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:58,185
- Yes, sir, I'm already working on that.
- Let's head north.

667
00:37:00,277 --> 00:37:01,871
Hotch, there's an old grain

668
00:37:01,996 --> 00:37:03,886
and feed barn north of town

669
00:37:04,156 --> 00:37:07,121
called golden harvest.
Boyd's father was killed there.

670
00:37:07,246 --> 00:37:09,679
Garcia's searching for
an exact address right now.

671
00:37:09,996 --> 00:37:12,145
- OK, right. We'll see you there.
- His victims.

672
00:37:15,758 --> 00:37:17,914
Reid, I want you to stay
with the crime scene, OK?

673
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:20,129
I'll call the state
and local bureau offices.

674
00:37:20,254 --> 00:37:22,125
They'll be here as soon as they can.

675
00:37:31,799 --> 00:37:33,584
Try not to shoot
that inside the car.

676
00:37:34,016 --> 00:37:35,544
You mean try not to deafen you?

677
00:37:35,903 --> 00:37:36,712
Exactly.

678
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:41,925
There's his vehicle.

679
00:37:50,689 --> 00:37:53,138
You take the side door.
I'll take the front.

680
00:37:57,462 --> 00:37:59,109
Watch the windows up top.

681
00:38:21,134 --> 00:38:23,572
- Do you have a shot?
- I can't see anything.

682
00:38:30,361 --> 00:38:32,017
- Prentiss, look out!
- I got him.

683
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:46,198
- You all right?
- Yeah.

684
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:50,059
Are you out of your mind?
You blew out my eardrum.

685
00:38:50,101 --> 00:38:52,240
What did you want me to do?
He was coming right at us.

686
00:38:52,282 --> 00:38:54,623
- I told you I had him.
- He was shooting at us, Emily.

687
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,462
You could have given me a heads-up.

688
00:38:56,835 --> 00:39:00,128
The loaded mp-5 and the lunatic
shooting at us wasn't enough? Come on.

689
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:12,464
The state's sending
out a crime scene team.

690
00:39:12,769 --> 00:39:15,894
It's going to be hard to identify the
bodies with out missing persons reports.

691
00:39:16,261 --> 00:39:18,188
I called that advocate,
Richard Corral.

692
00:39:18,853 --> 00:39:20,399
He's contacting families

693
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:22,911
with missing relatives.
He's gonna try and get some DNA.

694
00:39:23,036 --> 00:39:24,069
That'll help.

695
00:39:24,868 --> 00:39:25,958
This is a mess.

696
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:28,520
It would have been a bigger
mess without sheriff Ruiz,

697
00:39:28,645 --> 00:39:31,368
- and it would still be happening.
- Did she have any family?

698
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:33,702
I already have Garcia
checking into it.

699
00:39:34,369 --> 00:39:37,346
I'm going to call Brooklyn homicide,
talk to some of the guys I know there.

700
00:39:37,471 --> 00:39:39,668
- They'll honor her shield.
- That's good.

701
00:39:39,793 --> 00:39:41,712
An ex-nypd Detective
would like that.

702
00:39:47,673 --> 00:39:48,786
Let's go home.

703
00:39:56,891 --> 00:39:58,478
"Many persons have the wrong idea

704
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,711
"of what constitutes true happiness.

705
00:40:01,028 --> 00:40:03,208
"It is not attained
through self-gratification

706
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:05,645
"but through fidelity
to a worthy purpose."

707
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,145
Helen Keller.
