1
00:01:00,505 --> 00:01:03,983
A heat advisory has been issued
for Los Angeles and orange counties.

2
00:01:04,322 --> 00:01:07,460
Temperatures reached 110
in the inland valleys,

3
00:01:07,461 --> 00:01:09,397
Creating increased power demands.

4
00:01:09,517 --> 00:01:12,533
City and county officials have
declared shifting blackouts

5
00:01:12,534 --> 00:01:13,937
On a rotating basis.

6
00:01:14,057 --> 00:01:17,215
L.A. DWP spokeswoman
Karen Cramer announced...******

7
00:01:59,073 --> 00:02:00,968
What if it doesn't come back on?

8
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:03,410
It's only going to be
off from 12:00 to 3:00.

9
00:02:03,411 --> 00:02:05,863
Yeah, that's what they say,
but what if they mess it up?

10
00:02:05,864 --> 00:02:06,587
Stop.

11
00:02:07,133 --> 00:02:09,113
But, honey,
it's so seriously.

12
00:02:13,382 --> 00:02:14,754
it can't get any hotter.

13
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:21,344
What are you doing?

14
00:02:21,464 --> 00:02:22,967
It's 102 degrees.

15
00:02:22,968 --> 00:02:25,490
92 but...OK.

16
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:28,213
Besides, we're on
the second floor.

17
00:02:31,131 --> 00:02:32,068
What was that?

18
00:02:33,165 --> 00:02:34,532
You stay here.

19
00:02:55,295 --> 00:02:56,654
You see anyone?

20
00:02:57,882 --> 00:02:58,867
I'm sorry.

21
00:02:59,321 --> 00:03:00,544
All right. Be quiet.

22
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:11,374
Don't open it.

23
00:03:11,494 --> 00:03:12,629
I'm not going to.

24
00:03:15,532 --> 00:03:16,828
There's no one here.

25
00:03:20,411 --> 00:03:21,763
Come on, it's the wind.

26
00:03:21,883 --> 00:03:23,352
Come on. Come on.

27
00:03:28,913 --> 00:03:29,944
Damn it!

28
00:03:31,463 --> 00:03:33,331
- Yeah, real funny.
- I'm sorry.

29
00:03:35,426 --> 00:03:37,123
Maybe a garbage can blew over.

30
00:03:37,555 --> 00:03:39,018
Maybe a possum or something.

31
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:45,807
Honey. Huh?

32
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:47,828
Did you shut the window?

33
00:03:48,106 --> 00:03:48,898
What?

34
00:03:51,216 --> 00:03:52,191
Oh, my God!

35
00:04:12,248 --> 00:04:13,715
Hey, what did Strauss want?

36
00:04:13,996 --> 00:04:15,383
She needs us in Los Angeles.

37
00:04:15,385 --> 00:04:17,098
Home invasion homicide last night.

38
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:19,667
Officers found
Gregory Everson, 56,

39
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:23,138
Beaten, with a gsw to the head.
His wife Colleen was equally beaten

40
00:04:23,455 --> 00:04:24,653
And raped repeatedly.

41
00:04:24,773 --> 00:04:25,656
Repeatedly?

42
00:04:25,776 --> 00:04:27,134
That's what she reported.

43
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:29,043
Wait, she survived this?

44
00:04:29,044 --> 00:04:30,392
He chose to keep her alive.

45
00:04:30,512 --> 00:04:31,928
An intentional witness.

46
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:36,385
Everything but that points to an
organized offender, an experienced one.

47
00:04:36,505 --> 00:04:38,025
Was she able to identify him?

48
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:41,555
She said he was white, with
mean eyes and repulsive breath.

49
00:04:41,675 --> 00:04:43,261
Rotten inside and out.

50
00:04:43,707 --> 00:04:45,600
Did he rape her in
front of the husband?

51
00:04:46,563 --> 00:04:49,478
One home invasion rarely warrants
Strauss personally sending us out.

52
00:04:49,728 --> 00:04:53,019
No, there's more.
Ballistics match a double homicide

53
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,169
Downtown L.A., 48 miles away.

54
00:04:55,485 --> 00:04:57,785
Where 3 days ago, those 2
women were raped and killed.

55
00:04:57,786 --> 00:04:59,583
But last night was in the suburbs.

56
00:05:00,181 --> 00:05:01,854
They're afraid of
another night stalker.

57
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:48,115

Alfred Lord Tennyson wrote,

59
00:05:56,993 --> 00:06:00,655
And out of the darkness came the hands
that reached through nature, Molding men

60
00:06:04,825 --> 00:06:06,934
This guy's way too good at
this to have just started.

61
00:06:07,054 --> 00:06:08,885
He pulled off hours of
torture and a homicide

62
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:10,442
Without disturbing the neighbors.

63
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,765
- And robbed the house.
- That could be a habit.

64
00:06:12,802 --> 00:06:14,291
You think he started as a burglar?

65
00:06:14,387 --> 00:06:16,824
If it was just about the killing,
He wouldn't bother robbing them.

66
00:06:16,878 --> 00:06:18,550
Wait, how did he
get in last night?

67
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,939
Mrs. Everson said there was
a noise outside their door.

68
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,555
They were outside of
their room a few minutes,

69
00:06:22,556 --> 00:06:23,992
When they came back, he was there.

70
00:06:23,993 --> 00:06:25,256
He distracted them.

71
00:06:25,257 --> 00:06:27,199
So he could climb through
their bedroom window.

72
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:30,195
I'll have Garcia, see if that m.O.
Was used in any other home invasions.

73
00:06:30,315 --> 00:06:32,120
Well, victimology's
all over the map.

74
00:06:32,121 --> 00:06:35,095
3 murders and he managed
to kill men, women,

75
00:06:35,215 --> 00:06:39,049
Old, young, black, white, Hispanic.
That's about as random as it gets.

76
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:42,596
Randomness implies a lack of
predictability. I think that's the point

77
00:06:42,716 --> 00:06:45,516
All the varying people in his message.
He wants them all to fear him.

78
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:46,772
and they will.

79
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,919
Press got ahold of last
night's home invasion.

80
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,868
JJ and I will set
up at the station.

81
00:06:51,105 --> 00:06:53,541
Dave, you and Reid go visit
Mrs. Everson at the hospital.

82
00:06:53,809 --> 00:06:56,905
Morgan and Prentiss, the LAPD detectives
Are waiting for you at the everson house

83
00:07:14,857 --> 00:07:15,897
You hear that?

84
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,005
What?

85
00:07:17,434 --> 00:07:18,399
Exactly.

86
00:07:18,809 --> 00:07:21,825
What's wrong with us that we're
at peace at a crime scene?

87
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:23,854
Hotter than hell.

88
00:07:23,855 --> 00:07:25,934
Techs must have
turned off the a/c.

89
00:07:27,828 --> 00:07:28,525
See?

90
00:07:31,248 --> 00:07:32,162
At peace.

91
00:07:32,511 --> 00:07:34,338
What's the matter, more
hot flashes, ma'am?

92
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:37,323
Surprised a hotshot like you
doesn't need to cool down.

93
00:07:39,523 --> 00:07:41,144
When are the big guns coming?

94
00:07:41,264 --> 00:07:42,268
What's wrong?

95
00:07:42,388 --> 00:07:44,897
You afraid that they'll get
all the front pages now?

96
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,450
Hey. I never asked for that.

97
00:07:48,453 --> 00:07:49,572
Detectives.

98
00:07:49,573 --> 00:07:51,045
Quite a crowd out there.

99
00:07:52,962 --> 00:07:55,096
Matt Spicer. Adam Kurzbard.

100
00:07:55,216 --> 00:07:57,640
Hi. Emily Prentiss.
This is Derek Morgan.

101
00:07:57,641 --> 00:07:59,148
Hey, thanks for flying out.

102
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:00,953
So, what have you got?

103
00:08:00,954 --> 00:08:04,432
Got our hands full. Guy's been
across the city in a week.

104
00:08:04,433 --> 00:08:06,306
Seems completely random.

105
00:08:06,307 --> 00:08:07,713
You don't think it is?

106
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,706
We're robbery-homicide
in Newton division.

107
00:08:09,707 --> 00:08:12,028
The first 2 vics were right
in the middle of it.

108
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:14,513
The only thing that brought us all
the way out here were the bullets

109
00:08:14,633 --> 00:08:17,222
And the assault.
All the victims were raped.

110
00:08:17,342 --> 00:08:18,573
DNA match?

111
00:08:18,574 --> 00:08:19,582
He covers up.

112
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:22,653
The Eversons were in their bedroom
Upstairs when the electricity went out.

113
00:08:22,773 --> 00:08:24,054
So the unsub cut the power.

114
00:08:24,055 --> 00:08:27,125
No. They've got rolling
blackouts scheduled.

115
00:08:27,126 --> 00:08:30,340
Trying to get through this heat wave
without the whole city going dark.

116
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,693
So, is that why he came out here?

117
00:08:32,694 --> 00:08:35,889
Well, people are afraid of the dark.
He probably preyed on that.

118
00:08:36,244 --> 00:08:39,010
Ok, so the lights go out and this
guy starts banging on the door.

119
00:08:39,011 --> 00:08:41,448
Why give them the heads-up like that?
Why not just break in?

120
00:08:41,449 --> 00:08:44,443
He probably likes getting their
adrenaline going. Makes for a fun fight

121
00:08:44,682 --> 00:08:47,222
Sounds like he got one.
Wife's real shook up.

122
00:08:47,223 --> 00:08:48,990
I don't think she's
gonna be much help.

123
00:08:51,568 --> 00:08:53,119
Why is she in restraints?

124
00:08:54,215 --> 00:08:55,968
She tried to kill herself.

125
00:08:57,449 --> 00:08:58,255
Twice.

126
00:09:04,982 --> 00:09:06,029
Mrs. Everson?

127
00:09:07,618 --> 00:09:09,318
We're with the FBI.

128
00:09:14,885 --> 00:09:18,094
We know you talked to the
detectives this morning.

129
00:09:18,996 --> 00:09:21,144
But if you're up for
a few more questions,

130
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,800
It could help.

131
00:09:25,477 --> 00:09:27,611
Why didn't he kill me?

132
00:09:33,449 --> 00:09:35,634
it wasn't about you.

133
00:09:35,754 --> 00:09:39,199
This man only thinks about power

134
00:09:39,785 --> 00:09:40,985
And control.

135
00:09:44,774 --> 00:09:47,278
Leaving you behind gives him that.

136
00:09:50,696 --> 00:09:51,502
Now...

137
00:09:52,556 --> 00:09:55,223
Did he ever speak to you directly?

138
00:10:01,075 --> 00:10:02,456
Did you talk to you?

139
00:10:03,511 --> 00:10:05,200
No, he really didn't.

140
00:10:06,093 --> 00:10:06,986
I'm sorry.

141
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,772
It's OK.
Take your time.

142
00:10:10,606 --> 00:10:12,148
Greg looked at me...

143
00:10:13,803 --> 00:10:15,459
The way he always did. I...

144
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,030
We didn't need words. We...

145
00:10:20,205 --> 00:10:21,273
He just...

146
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:25,280
Looked at me and we would know.

147
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:29,048
I tried to be strong, but I...

148
00:10:29,614 --> 00:10:30,333
I...

149
00:10:30,945 --> 00:10:32,620
Shut my eyes...

150
00:10:34,747 --> 00:10:36,910
When the gun went off, and...

151
00:10:38,151 --> 00:10:40,590
That's the last thing Greg saw.

152
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:44,252
Now every time I shut my eyes...

153
00:10:46,181 --> 00:10:47,190
I see him.

154
00:10:49,718 --> 00:10:51,460
How long will that last?

155
00:10:58,536 --> 00:10:59,802
You rest now.

156
00:11:09,538 --> 00:11:11,408
yeah. We'll have him on the 11:00.

157
00:11:11,528 --> 00:11:12,391
Thanks.

158
00:11:12,957 --> 00:11:14,034
Hey. Where's Rossi?

159
00:11:14,035 --> 00:11:15,772
He's talking with
Hotch and Morgan.

160
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,628
It's incredibly detailed.

161
00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:22,115
Yeah. Detective Matt Spicer and
his partner are the go-to guys

162
00:11:22,235 --> 00:11:25,175
For robbery-homicide, central bureau,
Newton division, the busiest in L.A.

163
00:11:30,664 --> 00:11:33,105
It's Garcia.
Hey, Garcia, I got JJ here.

164
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:34,834
Praise the gods. Los Angeles

165
00:11:34,835 --> 00:11:37,999
Has a weirdly low rate of
home invasion burglaries.

166
00:11:38,119 --> 00:11:40,070
I snagged a case in Westchester

167
00:11:40,071 --> 00:11:43,331
Where a guy violently
knocked down the front door,

168
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:45,641
Kicked the dog, and
took off with the TV.

169
00:11:45,682 --> 00:11:47,401
Breaking down the front
door sends a message.

170
00:11:47,402 --> 00:11:49,100
He's trying to
intimidate the victims.

171
00:11:49,101 --> 00:11:52,136
Yeah, and as horrible as this
dog-kicking burglar sounds,

172
00:11:52,137 --> 00:11:54,400
I think the guy we're looking
for is even more horrible.

173
00:11:54,401 --> 00:11:56,618
Garcia, this unsub's had
practice, a lot of it.

174
00:11:56,619 --> 00:11:58,954
Maybe not in L.A., but he's
definitely done this before.

175
00:11:58,955 --> 00:12:00,660
Word. This is not his
first crime party.

176
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,718
I seriously can't find
a single case in L.A.

177
00:12:02,838 --> 00:12:04,959
That equals this level
of emotional destruction.

178
00:12:05,027 --> 00:12:07,269
We need to expand the search
to all of Southern California.

179
00:12:07,296 --> 00:12:09,264
He can be in other cities with
a quick ride on the freeways.

180
00:12:09,317 --> 00:12:11,109
Yeah. Will do.
Thanks, Garcia.

181
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,218
We're going live on the 11:00 news.
You think he'll be watching?

182
00:12:15,338 --> 00:12:18,134
It's late. He could
already be hunting.

183
00:12:25,616 --> 00:12:28,917
Do you ever look at why
this victim, why this day,

184
00:12:28,918 --> 00:12:30,282
Why this crime?

185
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:31,676
- Always.
- Hmm.

186
00:12:31,722 --> 00:12:34,293
Do you ever think they were just in
the wrong place At the wrong time?

187
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,329
Sometimes.

188
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:37,392
Well, I don't believe
in coincidences.

189
00:12:37,393 --> 00:12:38,296
How come?

190
00:12:38,297 --> 00:12:41,060
Don't get me wrong. It's not like
I talk To the universe or anything.

191
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,777
I've just always believed that
things happen for a reason.

192
00:12:43,778 --> 00:12:45,974
It's hard to find the
reason for this, though.

193
00:12:45,975 --> 00:12:47,882
Utterly meaningless crimes,

194
00:12:47,883 --> 00:12:49,304
No obvious motivation.

195
00:12:49,305 --> 00:12:52,101
Pure evil. Evil can't be
scientifically defined.

196
00:12:52,102 --> 00:12:54,396
It's an illusory moral concept
that doesn't exist in nature.

197
00:12:54,397 --> 00:12:56,401
Its origins and connotations
have been inextricably linked

198
00:12:56,402 --> 00:12:57,892
To religion and mythology.

199
00:12:58,012 --> 00:13:00,413
This offender has shown
no signs of any belief.

200
00:13:00,414 --> 00:13:03,685
I'm, uh, I'm Spencer Reid.
Matt Spicer.

201
00:13:03,719 --> 00:13:04,815
Jennifer Jareau.

202
00:13:04,901 --> 00:13:06,405
The media's been asking for you.

203
00:13:06,432 --> 00:13:08,490
Yeah, well, nobody else around
here wants to talk to them.

204
00:13:08,491 --> 00:13:09,991
I figure it hasn't hurt me yet.

205
00:13:09,992 --> 00:13:12,206
Uh, they'd like to interview
you for the 11:00 news.

206
00:13:12,207 --> 00:13:14,872
Can we go over a few points?
Absolutely.

207
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:17,667
The first 2 victims
earlier this week?

208
00:13:17,668 --> 00:13:19,834
Downtown. Killed about 2 A.M.

209
00:13:19,835 --> 00:13:22,570
We found them when
the sun came up.

210
00:13:25,184 --> 00:13:26,338
Not at noon?

211
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:29,444
Right. Vice were over
there about 6 A.M.

212
00:13:30,346 --> 00:13:33,175
Both these clocks are
stopped at 12:00.

213
00:13:33,295 --> 00:13:35,247
Was there a blackout?

214
00:13:35,651 --> 00:13:37,085
They started last night.

215
00:13:37,086 --> 00:13:38,853
So then he cut their power.

216
00:13:38,854 --> 00:13:40,867
But he let the city
do it last night.

217
00:13:40,868 --> 00:13:43,124
Where's the next rolling blackout?

218
00:13:45,215 --> 00:13:47,400
If you're driving through
the San Fernando valley,

219
00:13:47,401 --> 00:13:50,098
Beware--the power in
Glendale has just gone out,

220
00:13:50,099 --> 00:13:51,699
Thanks to the rolling blackouts.

221
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,401
Stay tuned for further details.

222
00:13:53,402 --> 00:13:55,016
Now let's take a
look at the weather.

223
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,799
Well, the heat is not
gonna break anytime soon,

224
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,304
With temperatures still
hovering at 97 degrees.

225
00:14:00,305 --> 00:14:02,054
Look for overnight
lows to be about 90.

226
00:14:02,055 --> 00:14:03,571
Same situation for tomorrow...

227
00:14:03,691 --> 00:14:05,648
Oh, come on.

228
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:35,163
Ok, sweetie, we're home.

229
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,443
Officers arrived at the
home of Annie Danzi

230
00:15:25,444 --> 00:15:27,133
Just after 11:00 this morning...

231
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,415
This time a young
child was left behind.

232
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:32,482
LAPD investigator Matt Spicer
is the lead on this case...

233
00:15:32,483 --> 00:15:35,489
...HELD BY THE FBI's BEHAVIORAL
ANALYSIS UNIT LATER THIS MORNING.

234
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:38,068
The profilers arrived in
Los Angeles last night.

235
00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:39,228
We're going live now
to Annie Danzi's home.

236
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:42,024
We've been told the
FBI has just arrived.

237
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:44,326
Agent Jareau. Agent Jareau.

238
00:15:44,327 --> 00:15:46,543
This is the second
home invasion homicide

239
00:15:46,544 --> 00:15:47,797
That started since the blackouts.

240
00:15:47,798 --> 00:15:49,464
Will you confirm that
they're connected?

241
00:15:49,506 --> 00:15:51,801
How are you going to keep the
residents safe in these areas?

242
00:15:51,802 --> 00:15:54,813
We're working close with
city officials and LAPD

243
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:58,159
To determine what steps we need to
take to ensure everyone's safety.

244
00:15:58,279 --> 00:15:59,839
Will they call off the blackouts?

245
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,303
Not at this time.

246
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:03,021
Annie Danzi.

247
00:16:03,242 --> 00:16:04,678
30, single mom.

248
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,197
Was her child home?

249
00:16:06,317 --> 00:16:08,388
Spicer's with him now.

250
00:16:11,695 --> 00:16:13,690
So the power was
out 10:00 to 1:00?

251
00:16:13,691 --> 00:16:15,327
All the same tricks.

252
00:16:15,328 --> 00:16:17,285
Forced entry?-No.

253
00:16:17,642 --> 00:16:19,558
Were there rolling
blackouts last summer?

254
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:21,049
Oh, just about every year.

255
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:22,639
Anything like this happen?

256
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,902
Well, crime always goes
up when it's hot and dark,

257
00:16:24,903 --> 00:16:26,728
But this?

258
00:16:27,434 --> 00:16:28,511
No way.

259
00:16:28,512 --> 00:16:31,176
Hunting in the dark is definitely
a part of his signature.

260
00:16:36,164 --> 00:16:37,456
Garcia. Yes, sir.

261
00:16:37,576 --> 00:16:39,214
I need you to check if
there were any clusters

262
00:16:39,215 --> 00:16:41,065
Of home invasions
in previous summers

263
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:43,664
During rolling blackouts in
California. Look statewide.

264
00:16:43,665 --> 00:16:46,400
He left a message this time.

265
00:16:51,868 --> 00:16:53,834
A first time for everything.

266
00:16:53,835 --> 00:16:55,805
You think he's welcoming us?

267
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,345
Who knows?

268
00:16:57,346 --> 00:17:00,526
At least he's telling us
more with each crime scene.

269
00:17:01,216 --> 00:17:04,236
Uneducated. Made the kid watch.

270
00:17:04,448 --> 00:17:06,574
Sadistic.

271
00:17:07,048 --> 00:17:11,330
Trashes the place even though
there's not that much to steal.

272
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:13,094
Angry.

273
00:17:13,095 --> 00:17:15,763
Chooses to hunt and
kill in the dark.

274
00:17:15,764 --> 00:17:17,131
Doesn't want to be seen.

275
00:17:17,132 --> 00:17:18,666
Why?

276
00:17:19,085 --> 00:17:21,940
Maybe he's ashamed of something.

277
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:24,876
Well, he didn't have
to knock those over.

278
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:28,411
He doesn't want any eyes on him.

279
00:17:28,412 --> 00:17:30,848
Except the kid.

280
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:33,180
Didn't want him to miss a thing.

281
00:17:36,686 --> 00:17:37,985
What you got there?

282
00:17:37,986 --> 00:17:39,562
Is that a robot?

283
00:17:39,563 --> 00:17:41,065
It's a monster.

284
00:17:41,066 --> 00:17:43,595
Monster, huh? What's it doing?

285
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:46,450
It's protecting you, right?

286
00:17:46,451 --> 00:17:49,339
It's gonna make the man stay away.

287
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,691
Did you happen to get
a look at that man?

288
00:17:51,692 --> 00:17:54,670
Or was it too dark under the bed?

289
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,459
He moved me to the closet.

290
00:17:59,742 --> 00:18:02,158
And my mom told me
to close my eyes.

291
00:18:05,597 --> 00:18:07,973
Would you mind showing
me how you did that?

292
00:18:13,766 --> 00:18:16,383
That's good, kid.
That's really, really good.

293
00:18:17,982 --> 00:18:19,980
So you didn't see him at all?

294
00:18:20,504 --> 00:18:22,092
Once that man left,
what did you do?

295
00:18:22,093 --> 00:18:24,188
Did you get back under the bed?

296
00:18:26,483 --> 00:18:28,628
I didn't want to leave her.

297
00:18:30,123 --> 00:18:32,745
But you were scared.

298
00:18:35,702 --> 00:18:37,789
Hey, Carter,

299
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:41,286
Do you, um, do you have
like a really cool backpack

300
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:44,153
You could throw some things in to
take over to your cousin's house?

301
00:18:44,154 --> 00:18:46,312
It's in my room.

302
00:18:46,313 --> 00:18:48,039
Will you come with me?

303
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,914
You bet.

304
00:18:58,497 --> 00:19:00,640
Look, I'm really glad the
kid didn't see anything,

305
00:19:00,641 --> 00:19:02,942
But it could have been helpful.

306
00:19:03,619 --> 00:19:05,954
But covering his eyes like that,

307
00:19:05,955 --> 00:19:08,770
That means he couldn't
cover his ears.

308
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:18,857
Forcing a child to witness
this is clearly sadistic.

309
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:21,673
He destroyed the boy's innocence
and took away his childhood.

310
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:23,929
This probably mirrors the
unsub's own experience.

311
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,811
That's an excuse for
what he's doing?

312
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:27,594
There's no excuse
for what he's doing.

313
00:19:27,714 --> 00:19:29,501
We're not justifying anything.

314
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,704
Everything he says,
everything he does

315
00:19:31,705 --> 00:19:34,373
Tell us what makes
him tick, that's all.

316
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:36,212
The message that he
left us was misspelled,

317
00:19:36,213 --> 00:19:38,128
Which says that he was
not well-educated.

318
00:19:38,162 --> 00:19:39,378
Why did he leave one now?

319
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:41,103
That we don't know--yet.

320
00:19:41,104 --> 00:19:43,315
Just because his recent
attacks are in Los Angeles

321
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:45,484
Doesn't mean he's from here.

322
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:48,398
Killing in the dark is a must for him.
We believe that's why he's come to L.A.

323
00:19:48,439 --> 00:19:50,246
That and his willingness
to kill random people

324
00:19:50,247 --> 00:19:52,178
Tells us that he's an
opportunistic offender,

325
00:19:52,179 --> 00:19:54,785
And these types are incredibly
difficult to predict.

326
00:19:54,786 --> 00:19:57,506
And as you all know, the rolling
blackouts have been announced

327
00:19:57,507 --> 00:20:00,332
So residents can prepare for the
few hours they'll be in darkness.

328
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,401
Unfortunately, that
also tells the killer

329
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:05,437
Whose windows will be open,
whose alarms will be disarmed.

330
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:07,517
The dark is his signature.
It's a habit,

331
00:20:07,518 --> 00:20:09,411
and we'll find That he's
always killed this way.

332
00:20:09,412 --> 00:20:10,566
'cause he's a coward.

333
00:20:10,567 --> 00:20:13,093
To some degree, yes.
He also has intimacy issues.

334
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:15,281
He even turns photographs
away from himself.

335
00:20:15,282 --> 00:20:16,728
It's unlikely that a man like this

336
00:20:16,729 --> 00:20:18,817
Has been in any kind
of relationship.

337
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:21,689
There's also a good chance that
he has some type of shortcoming.

338
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,123
Whether real or perceived,

339
00:20:23,124 --> 00:20:24,990
He's obviously self-conscious
about something.

340
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:27,642
Like what? It could be
like a physical deformity.

341
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,244
It might be something
really small to us,

342
00:20:29,245 --> 00:20:30,482
But it means everything to him.

343
00:20:30,483 --> 00:20:32,331
People just want to fit in.

344
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:34,018
Having one thing that sets
him apart from the norm

345
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:35,663
Could be what led him
into the extreme solitude

346
00:20:35,664 --> 00:20:37,604
Of a violent schizoid personality.

347
00:20:37,605 --> 00:20:39,271
He takes his victims' power away,

348
00:20:39,272 --> 00:20:40,973
Literally and figuratively.

349
00:20:40,974 --> 00:20:43,443
And he feeds off of
making them powerless.

350
00:20:43,444 --> 00:20:45,678
We had rolling blackouts
all last summer,

351
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,553
And this guy wasn't around.

352
00:20:47,554 --> 00:20:48,914
Well, he is now.

353
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:51,050
And based on the vicious
nature of his crimes,

354
00:20:51,051 --> 00:20:54,053
The press has named him
the prince of darkness.

355
00:20:54,054 --> 00:20:55,988
Prince. That'll fuel his ego.

356
00:20:55,989 --> 00:20:58,295
Yeah. He's gonna be
all over the news.

357
00:20:58,296 --> 00:21:01,732
Once we unravel his need for
darkness, we'll find him.

358
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:17,609
What if he comes back?

359
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,877
He won't.

360
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:20,946
He can't hurt you again, OK?

361
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:23,682
How do you know?
You didn't find him.

362
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:26,560
You're right. But I will.

363
00:21:28,776 --> 00:21:30,889
She should have known better.

364
00:21:32,726 --> 00:21:35,561
Who? Your mom?

365
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:38,049
She tried to fight him,

366
00:21:38,169 --> 00:21:40,366
But he had a gun.

367
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:42,164
Why did she do that?

368
00:21:43,773 --> 00:21:46,467
She needed to protect you, Carter.

369
00:21:46,468 --> 00:21:50,516
The man who did this,
he's very bad, OK?

370
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:52,419
I'm going to find him.

371
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,315
I promise. Ok?

372
00:22:01,263 --> 00:22:03,287
All right.

373
00:22:05,247 --> 00:22:06,694
Thank you.

374
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:09,762
Yeah, Prentiss. What's the plan?

375
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,746
<i>Rolling blackouts
are still scheduled for tonight.</i>

376
00:22:12,035 --> 00:22:13,539
How's LAPD gonna patrol it?

377
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:16,470
With the number of calls they've been
getting, they're stretched thin already.

378
00:22:16,595 --> 00:22:17,934
<i>Then they gotta cancel it.</i>

379
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:20,254
That's the battle.
If they do that, the{\ whole} city could go dark

380
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,168
<i>if the power grid gets overwhelmed.</i>

381
00:22:23,515 --> 00:22:25,218
You're right.
That's not gonna work.

382
00:22:25,508 --> 00:22:27,383
LAPD's outnumbered 10,000 to 1.

383
00:22:28,285 --> 00:22:29,679
All right, keep me posted.

384
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:33,758
Did you tell her that we're gonna need
to talk to Carter Again tomorrow?

385
00:22:33,883 --> 00:22:35,353
He won't remember anything.

386
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:37,965
We have psychological markers,
things that could help him out.

387
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,603
You want to make him relive it?

388
00:22:39,728 --> 00:22:41,759
If it will help us catch this guy,
yes.

389
00:22:41,884 --> 00:22:44,560
You saw him.
He feels helpless, weak.

390
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:48,263
There's nothing he could have done about
it, but he's gonna keep blaming himself.

391
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:51,914
{\You know, }Carter didn't reveal that much.

392
00:22:53,426 --> 00:22:54,832
How come you know all this?

393
00:22:55,418 --> 00:22:57,539
Because when I was a kid,
I lost my parents.

394
00:22:58,957 --> 00:22:59,957
How?

395
00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:01,552
Drunk driver.

396
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:04,132
- And you were in the car?
- No.

397
00:23:05,055 --> 00:23:07,135
You seem to have some insight,
as if you witnessed it.

398
00:23:07,926 --> 00:23:10,469
Maybe because I pictured it
a thousand times.

399
00:23:26,785 --> 00:23:27,933
My parents...

400
00:23:32,152 --> 00:23:34,894
They were racing home
'cause I was sick.

401
00:23:36,726 --> 00:23:39,691
If they hadn't left right then, they
would have missed that intersection,

402
00:23:40,675 --> 00:23:42,621
and there wouldn't have been
a red light.

403
00:23:47,346 --> 00:23:48,670
I lost my father...

404
00:23:49,901 --> 00:23:51,319
When I was 9 years old.

405
00:23:52,784 --> 00:23:54,764
He was shot and killed right
in front of me.

406
00:23:56,759 --> 00:23:58,575
There was nothing I could do.

407
00:24:01,294 --> 00:24:03,087
So I choose to look at it like this,

408
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,720
we all have people in our lives.

409
00:24:07,556 --> 00:24:08,915
Some of them are good.

410
00:24:10,638 --> 00:24:11,951
Some of them are bad.

411
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,162
But they shape us, Detective.

412
00:24:17,658 --> 00:24:19,170
That's why you have that badge.

413
00:24:20,424 --> 00:24:22,908
That's why the two of us are sitting
in this car right now.

414
00:24:47,427 --> 00:24:48,435
How's the boy?

415
00:24:49,173 --> 00:24:51,229
- He's quiet.
- Too soon for an interview?

416
00:24:51,354 --> 00:24:53,842
I want to find this guy before we have
to put the kid through it.

417
00:24:53,967 --> 00:24:55,869
Guys, Garcia has something.

418
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,377
<i>Everybody needs to sit down
'cause I'm about to rock your world</i>

419
00:24:58,502 --> 00:25:01,332
<i>and not in a way I like to do it.</i>
I have scoured and searched

420
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,623
and you were totally right.
This unsub has been doing it forever.

421
00:25:04,922 --> 00:25:07,171
There is nowhere he hasn't been
in the last 26 years.

422
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,173
Honestly. Every single state.

423
00:25:09,562 --> 00:25:10,883
48 continental. My point,

424
00:25:11,484 --> 00:25:14,262
He is the worst I've ever seen,
and we have all seen some things.

425
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,764
- How did you connect him?
- Everything you said.

426
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:19,287
He's drawn to the dark. He shows up
during a blackout, He robs, he kills,

427
00:25:19,412 --> 00:25:21,655
- he leaves a witness.
- <i>How's he getting away with this?</i>

428
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,549
- He never hits the same city twice.
- Except Los Angeles.

429
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,626
I'm sending everything your way
and you better load up that printer,

430
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:48,045
<i>'cause it looks like he started
in Southern California Way back</i>

431
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,714
<i>in the summer of 1984.</i>

432
00:25:50,053 --> 00:25:52,049
Thank God the press
hasn't connected this.

433
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,211
The summer Olympics were
in Los Angeles that year.

434
00:25:54,336 --> 00:25:55,711
So was Richard Ramirez.

435
00:25:55,836 --> 00:25:57,763
- That's the year he started.
- He never left.

436
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:00,892
- Stayed in L.A. For a few years.
- Fine. I'll look into it.

437
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,644
<i>It appears our unsub
started that summer</i>

438
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:06,538
during a blackout in San Diego.
From there he went to orange county.

439
00:26:06,663 --> 00:26:09,734
After that he ended up in Los Angeles
and then worked his way up the coast.

440
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:12,100
- Why did he come back?
- And why now?

441
00:26:13,966 --> 00:26:15,512
<i>It's gonna be hot again tonight.</i>

442
00:26:15,637 --> 00:26:18,910
<i>You might be better off sleeping in your
car or just getting the hell out of L.A.</i>

443
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:22,567
<i>Anything to get away from the darkness
and what happens in it.</i>

444
00:26:23,118 --> 00:26:26,247
<i>All right, we're about to lose Arcadia.
They've got that 9:00 to midnight shift.</i>

445
00:26:26,372 --> 00:26:28,316
<i>Chatsworth,
you're gone from 10:00 to 1:00.</i>

446
00:26:28,441 --> 00:26:30,203
<i>Check us out online for a full list.</i>

447
00:26:30,328 --> 00:26:33,273
<i>We'll be here until midnight
or I guess until the lights go out.</i>

448
00:26:33,398 --> 00:26:36,320
<i>Look at that.
It's a cool 99 degrees here</i>

449
00:26:36,691 --> 00:26:38,121
<i>at 99.6.</i>

450
00:26:56,929 --> 00:26:58,616
Get here about 10:15?

451
00:26:59,203 --> 00:27:02,320
I want you to check the neighborhood, see
if there are any surveillance cameras.

452
00:27:02,445 --> 00:27:04,163
- They may not be working...
- Kurz

453
00:27:05,449 --> 00:27:06,480
Thanks.

454
00:27:08,773 --> 00:27:10,211
Did he leave a message?

455
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:12,421
The son of a bitch left a baby
in there.

456
00:27:13,027 --> 00:27:14,507
- Alive?
- Yeah.

457
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,960
A baby?

458
00:27:19,975 --> 00:27:21,710
Yes, sir. Thank you very much.

459
00:27:22,272 --> 00:27:24,393
- What's up?
- Everyone will have power tonight.

460
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:26,727
- They called off the blackouts?
- After what happened earlier,

461
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,450
- we can't give them that again.
- Great, I'll tell the press.

462
00:27:31,243 --> 00:27:33,926
We're talking over 200 houses
in 26 years.

463
00:27:34,051 --> 00:27:36,487
When he started in San Diego,
it was all about the robberies.

464
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:39,143
By the time he got to orange county,
he robbed and assaulted his victims.

465
00:27:39,268 --> 00:27:41,229
First murder was in long beach
and he left a witness.

466
00:27:41,354 --> 00:27:42,952
He got away with it for 26 years.

467
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,346
Why did he come back?

468
00:27:45,506 --> 00:27:47,915
<i>Good news, everybody.
The lights are back on.</i>

469
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,041
<i>That's right.</i>

470
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,670
<i>The prince of darkness
Is gonna have to take the night off.</i>

471
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,721
<i>Still no suspects
in the blackout murders.</i>

472
00:27:53,846 --> 00:27:57,057
<i>But investigators believe there's
a reason why he's stayed in Los Angeles</i>

473
00:27:57,303 --> 00:27:59,178
<i>despite
the publicized investigation.</i>

474
00:27:59,565 --> 00:28:00,565
Thanks.

475
00:28:00,924 --> 00:28:02,869
The media coverage actually helped.

476
00:28:02,994 --> 00:28:05,426
Neighbors were hypervigilant.
As soon as they heard the gunfire

477
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:08,438
- they called the police.
- Did he leave a message this time?

478
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,627
He actually left a baby
in the closet.

479
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,180
There's got to be some kind
of message in that.

480
00:28:13,305 --> 00:28:16,321
He's taunting us. He's leaving behind
witnesses That are too little to help.

481
00:28:20,464 --> 00:28:21,471
Why them?

482
00:28:22,151 --> 00:28:22,992
Why now?

483
00:28:23,393 --> 00:28:26,452
He killed these two women
before the rolling blackouts.

484
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,956
What is it about them?
He killed them in a busy,

485
00:28:29,255 --> 00:28:30,556
well-lit area.

486
00:28:30,813 --> 00:28:32,395
It was nothing like the others.

487
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,295
It's, shootin' Newton.

488
00:28:34,997 --> 00:28:37,059
People hear gunfire down there
all the time.

489
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:40,387
- He probably fit right in.
- It was in your division.

490
00:28:40,669 --> 00:28:42,094
He had to start somewhere.

491
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,013
So you think
it's just a coincidence?

492
00:28:46,676 --> 00:28:49,685
All right, let's say it's not. What
does that mean, he wanted our attention?

493
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:50,930
He certainly has it.

494
00:28:51,055 --> 00:28:52,980
You're sure you never working
anything like this before?

495
00:28:53,403 --> 00:28:55,301
Trust me,
this guy makes an impression.

496
00:28:55,758 --> 00:28:57,818
He started his career 26 years ago.

497
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,321
Same as me.

498
00:29:02,938 --> 00:29:04,492
You think this is because of me?

499
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,720
That all these people
are dead because of that?

500
00:29:06,966 --> 00:29:09,038
Two women killed in your division,
no survivors.

501
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:12,208
Then a couple, leaving the wife as a
witness. Then a mother, leaving the son.

502
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:14,710
Now two parents,
but a baby survives.

503
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,953
If there's some kind of pattern,
I've never seen it before.

504
00:29:17,078 --> 00:29:18,938
He circled back to L. A for a reason.

505
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:22,009
The first two murders here in L.A.
county were close by. Long beach is on

506
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:25,111
- the cusp of L.A. and orange counties.
- Let's look into that one.

507
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:28,974
Home invasion. A husband was shot.

508
00:29:29,646 --> 00:29:31,064
Wife was left alive.

509
00:29:31,189 --> 00:29:33,232
- Sounds familiar.
- What's the next one?

510
00:29:33,357 --> 00:29:35,573
After long beach,
he went to Santa Monica.

511
00:29:38,392 --> 00:29:39,360
Wait a minute.

512
00:29:39,775 --> 00:29:40,569
Spicer,

513
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,197
- do you have family out there?
- Yes, that's where I grew up.

514
00:29:44,425 --> 00:29:46,664
Home invasion robbery,
double homicide.

515
00:29:47,179 --> 00:29:48,577
Joe and Sylvia Spicer

516
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,038
- were killed.
- Those are my parents.

517
00:29:54,218 --> 00:29:56,293
It doesn't make any sense.
Let me see that.

518
00:30:00,276 --> 00:30:02,444
They died in a car accident.
A drunk driver.

519
00:30:02,569 --> 00:30:03,968
Who told you that?

520
00:30:04,342 --> 00:30:05,386
My grandparents.

521
00:30:06,393 --> 00:30:08,210
I remember my grandfather
waking me up.

522
00:30:08,335 --> 00:30:10,292
I was sick the night they died.
I had a fever.

523
00:30:10,417 --> 00:30:11,897
How would I not remember
that happening to them?

524
00:30:12,022 --> 00:30:14,812
Maybe your grandparents never told you.
They were trying to protect you.

525
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,433
They lied?

526
00:30:16,778 --> 00:30:18,688
You were the first child
he left alive.

527
00:30:19,872 --> 00:30:21,501
You've been all over the news.

528
00:30:22,263 --> 00:30:23,856
This guy knows who you are.

529
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:33,761
This is crazy.

530
00:30:39,245 --> 00:30:41,672
When Carter said that the unsub
made him watch from the closet,

531
00:30:42,374 --> 00:30:43,299
you flinched.

532
00:30:43,605 --> 00:30:46,469
- And you didn't?
- This guy is taunting you.

533
00:30:46,753 --> 00:30:49,180
He left a young boy
alive and now a baby.

534
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:51,311
He wants you to know it's him.

535
00:30:55,034 --> 00:30:56,454
How could I not know?

536
00:30:56,496 --> 00:30:58,453
You did. Deep down.

537
00:30:58,725 --> 00:31:00,784
But you went through
a major trauma as a kid.

538
00:31:00,826 --> 00:31:02,886
You believed the story
because it was easier.

539
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,113
And now what?

540
00:31:05,101 --> 00:31:07,323
You want to make me remember
what really happened?

541
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:10,117
I mean, come on, it was 26 years ago.
What good is that gonna do?

542
00:31:11,082 --> 00:31:12,320
It's your call.

543
00:31:22,736 --> 00:31:25,382
Is this, you know,
like hypnosis or something?

544
00:31:25,982 --> 00:31:28,403
No. I'm just gonna try
and trigger some memories

545
00:31:28,445 --> 00:31:30,596
by walking you through
what happened that night.

546
00:31:30,907 --> 00:31:31,952
All right.

547
00:31:32,397 --> 00:31:34,376
Should I, uh, close my eyes or...

548
00:31:34,506 --> 00:31:36,644
If you want. I just want
you to try and relax.

549
00:31:37,146 --> 00:31:38,162
Ok.

550
00:31:41,422 --> 00:31:42,477
Here we go.

551
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:44,718
It was July.

552
00:31:45,832 --> 00:31:47,018
And it was hot.

553
00:31:48,868 --> 00:31:50,241
Were the windows open?

554
00:31:51,686 --> 00:31:52,725
Yeah.

555
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,963
And, uh,...

556
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,203
there was a breeze.

557
00:31:57,598 --> 00:31:59,520
Good. Good.
That's really good.

558
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,470
What do you hear?

559
00:32:02,994 --> 00:32:04,702
Uh, nothing.

560
00:32:05,947 --> 00:32:07,609
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

561
00:32:07,885 --> 00:32:10,825
Yeah, my grandfather woke me up
and he told me about the accident.

562
00:32:10,867 --> 00:32:13,043
Slow down. Slow down.
Stay with me.

563
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,803
There was a breeze.

564
00:32:16,681 --> 00:32:18,040
What did you smell?

565
00:32:20,794 --> 00:32:21,814
Seriously?

566
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:22,990
Just try.

567
00:32:25,538 --> 00:32:26,594
Ok.

568
00:32:28,665 --> 00:32:30,099
What did you smell?

569
00:32:30,594 --> 00:32:32,061
What did I smell?
Um...

570
00:32:33,693 --> 00:32:35,070
<i>I don't know. Uh...</i>

571
00:32:40,932 --> 00:32:42,569
I smelled the ocean.

572
00:32:46,999 --> 00:32:48,505
<i>My mother's perfume.</i>

573
00:32:53,545 --> 00:32:55,040
Spicer.
What?

574
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:58,843
Cigarettes?

575
00:33:00,469 --> 00:33:02,969
This is weird.
I smell cigarettes.

576
00:33:03,734 --> 00:33:05,489
<i>Did your grandfather smoke?</i>

577
00:33:05,743 --> 00:33:06,816
<i>Never.</i>

578
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:08,298
<i>Come on, think.</i>

579
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:09,994
<i>Who was it?</i>

580
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,762
<i>Hello there.</i>

581
00:33:21,641 --> 00:33:22,982
He said,...

582
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,714
"Hello there."

583
00:33:25,129 --> 00:33:26,889
That was his first message.

584
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:28,880
What's he doing?

585
00:33:29,056 --> 00:33:30,365
He's...

586
00:33:31,127 --> 00:33:32,606
he's dragging me.

587
00:33:32,648 --> 00:33:34,612
I hear my baby sister crying.

588
00:33:36,009 --> 00:33:38,917
I hear my daddy.
He's yelling.

589
00:33:38,959 --> 00:33:41,436
<i>Get out of here!
Don't you touch me, you son of a...</i>

590
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:45,251
<i>He killed my dad.</i>

591
00:33:45,927 --> 00:33:47,727
<i>Please don't hurt my babies.</i>

592
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:49,902
<i>I can't see his face.</i>

593
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,323
<i>Take me.</i>

594
00:33:51,694 --> 00:33:53,206
<i>It's too dark.</i>

595
00:33:53,415 --> 00:33:55,053
<i>She's begging him.</i>

596
00:33:55,095 --> 00:33:56,492
<i>Please don't hurt them.</i>

597
00:33:58,052 --> 00:33:59,120
I can't...

598
00:33:59,582 --> 00:34:01,268
I couldn't see, man. I just...

599
00:34:01,849 --> 00:34:03,958
- I'm sorry. I couldn't.
- Ok. Hey.

600
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,814
- I'm sorry.
- No, that's enough.

601
00:34:05,856 --> 00:34:07,606
You did enough.
You're good.

602
00:34:08,274 --> 00:34:09,631
Ok. We cool?

603
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:19,092
Ok, why is he doing this?

604
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,519
He keeps a survivor
so that they'll never forget him,

605
00:34:21,561 --> 00:34:23,761
but with you, it goes
beyond that, because...

606
00:34:23,803 --> 00:34:25,961
He believes he turned
you into the city's hero.

607
00:34:26,003 --> 00:34:27,512
If your parents weren't killed,

608
00:34:27,554 --> 00:34:30,291
- you might not have become a Detective.
- Yeah, but how would he know that?

609
00:34:30,333 --> 00:34:32,682
It's not like he stayed in L.A.
He's been all over the country.

610
00:34:32,724 --> 00:34:35,498
The press has talked about
your history. He's not a part of it.

611
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,960
And he wants that recognition.

612
00:34:37,002 --> 00:34:38,928
He wants everyone
to know what he's done to you.

613
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:41,526
- How's he gonna do that?
- Is that your daughter?

614
00:34:44,964 --> 00:34:46,083
Where is she?

615
00:34:48,569 --> 00:34:50,796
She's with my sister at my house.

616
00:35:49,656 --> 00:35:51,074
Kristin? Ellie?

617
00:35:51,116 --> 00:35:52,171
Ellie?

- Are they on their way to the station?

624
00:36:39,282 --> 00:36:40,985
The car's still here
and the power's cut,

625
00:36:41,027 --> 00:36:43,260
- so the unsub was definitely here.
- Where are you going?

626
00:36:43,302 --> 00:36:44,910
We're gonna try his sister's place.

627
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,162
This guy needs privacy.

628
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,955
He didn't leave them
here for us to find,

629
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,374
- which means he took them somewhere.
- What's her address?

630
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,845
1720 Sheridan.

- Ok, good.

632
00:36:53,802 --> 00:36:56,046
I don't even know
if we're gonna find him there.

633
00:36:57,693 --> 00:36:59,745
- You know what? We won't.
- What?

634
00:36:59,787 --> 00:37:02,642
This is about you. There's
no history at your sister's place.

635
00:37:02,684 --> 00:37:05,488
He probably took them
to Santa Monica to your old house.

Promise me she'll be OK, Morgan.

692
00:41:06,161 --> 00:41:07,558
Go ahead,...

693
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:08,863
promise him.

694
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,420
Do it and promise him!

695
00:41:16,303 --> 00:41:18,225
- Promise me, Morgan.
- Ok.

696
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,355
Ok!

697
00:41:21,867 --> 00:41:23,021
I promise.

698
00:41:26,165 --> 00:41:27,683
I love you, Ellie.

699
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:32,865
- Daddy!
- No!

700
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:36,201
No! Spicer!
What is wrong with you?!

701
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:46,182
Take me, please.

702
00:41:49,324 --> 00:41:52,176
Please take me instead!
Please!

703
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,863
No! No!

704
00:41:53,905 --> 00:41:55,686
Oh, God, no!

705
00:41:55,728 --> 00:41:56,820
No!

706
00:41:57,294 --> 00:41:58,355
No!

707
00:41:58,891 --> 00:41:59,953
Don't...

708
00:42:01,312 --> 00:42:03,756
I don't usually take much to kids.

709
00:42:11,006 --> 00:42:12,129
This one's...

710
00:42:12,773 --> 00:42:13,946
just...

711
00:42:14,346 --> 00:42:15,699
Special.

712
00:42:16,424 --> 00:42:18,887
We will find you,
you sick son of a bitch.

713
00:42:18,929 --> 00:42:20,332
Is that another promise?

714
00:42:20,608 --> 00:42:23,003
Please!
Please, help!

715
00:42:23,045 --> 00:42:26,324
Ellie!
Oh, my God, Ellie, no!

716
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:28,248
I will find you!
