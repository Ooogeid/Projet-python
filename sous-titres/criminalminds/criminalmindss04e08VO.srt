1
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,010
Amy!

2
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:44,410
Most of us have done extensive post-graduate work
in areas such as abnormal psychology and sociology,

3
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:48,620
As well as intensive study of relative
case work and existing literature.

4
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,530
But that's after selection to the unit.

5
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:53,710
First you have to be an agent,work in the
field,and that's what we're here to talk about.

6
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,820
For that,the academics are wide open.

7
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:00,260
Everyone in this room,once you
graduate,regardless of your course study,

8
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,100
Is eligible to apply to the f.b.i.

9
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,270
What did you study?

10
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,500
Criminal justice.

11
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:10,260
But sports appreciation was all
full up at my community college.

12
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:14,520
I hold doctorates in
chemistry,mathematics,and engineering,

13
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,150
As well as b.a.s in
psychology and sociology.

14
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,830
what is he talking about?

15
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:24,880
How old are you?

16
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,650
Uh,i'm 27. As of last month,i turned 27.

17
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:32,560
I'm--i'm also completing an
additional b.a.in philosophy.

18
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,340
Which reminds me that i have a joke.

19
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:40,240
How many existentialists does
it take to screw in a light bulb?

20
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,860
Don't.

21
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,140
2.

22
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:48,350
one to change the light bulb and one to
observe how it symbolizes an incandescent

23
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:52,080
Beacon of subjectivity in a
netherworld of cosmic nothingness.

24
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,350
Um,an existentialist
would--

25
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:05,170
ok,before he does his quantum
physics knock-knock joke--

26
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:09,420
Do we have any other questions
about opportunities in the f.b.i.?

27
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,290
Did you ever shoot anybody?

28
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:20,350
I'm going to present this information to the
team,and if they're interested,i'll call you.

29
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,700
If your team is interested?

30
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,770
It's not a matter of interest.

31
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,520
You just said "interested."

32
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,720
detective,that's not quite what i meant.

33
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,950
Is it that it's only one
victim,not enough bodies for you?

34
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:31,550
Not at all.

35
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,020
My vic's aren't covered in
peanut butter and decapitated?

36
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,060
They only need to be
certain at they can help.

37
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,960
They sure as hell couldn't hurt.

38
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,560
That's actually not true,sir.

39
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,560
To take focus away from your investigation to
build a profile could be a waste of your time

40
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,330
And resources if you're
already on the right track.

41
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:46,680
The girl's been dead 3 months.

42
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,360
And you feel like if you don't do
something to help her,no one will.

43
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,830
The mom calls me 3 times a day.

44
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:59,220
I've been there. Chicago
p.d.trust me,i get it.

45
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,300
If there is something we
can do to help you,we will.

46
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,030
Cell number's on the report.

47
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,250
I'm supervisory special
agent derek morgan.

48
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:12,080
I'll call you personally.

49
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,790
We'll see.

50
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,700
You really need to be careful
how you phrase things--

51
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,280
What was that?

52
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:21,870
Excuse me?

53
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,870
I'll call you personally?
I'm the liaison.

54
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:24,460
You can
call if it--

55
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,910
and you didn't need to come in here
and take over my consultation like that.

56
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,000
It was your first solo.

57
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,000
I was simply trying to help you.

58
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:36,220
Well,from now on,supervisory special
agent morgan,if i need your help,i'll ask.

59
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:43,370
You're welcome,agent todd.

60
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,790
- Thank you so much.
- Oh,you're welcome.

61
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,710
Thank you. Bye.

62
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,930
You do know we want them
to actually join the bureau?

63
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,130
What?

64
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,320
We want these kids to think
it's a cool place to work.

65
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,270
I understand that,yeah.

66
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,370
Existentialism?

67
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:01,500
Existentialism
is-- Yes?

68
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,650
That was a funny joke. What do you mean?

69
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,920
Yeah,to sigmund freud.

70
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,030
I tell them i shouldn't-- they keep
on sending me here. I don't know why.

71
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:10,590
- Because you're young.
- Young?

72
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,020
Dr. Reid?

73
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:17,740
Wouldn't they sit in the dark and hope
that the bulb decided to light again?

74
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:19,320
Excuse me?

75
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,540
An existentialist would
never change the bulb.

76
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,880
He would allow the darkness to exist.

77
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,550
Yeah,that's pretty good.

78
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,640
I'm professor rothschild.

79
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,700
It was a brilliant
presentation. Brilliant.

80
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,650
You're a remarkably
effective recruitment tool.

81
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,560
The f.b.i.is very lucky to have you.

82
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,900
Thank you for saying that.

83
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,870
- May i show you something?
- Yeah,of course.

84
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,090
It's all right here.

85
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,030
I don't understand.
What--what are these?

86
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,920
7 homicide victims.

87
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,860
Homicide?

88
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,230
7 women.

89
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,810
The bodies have never been found.

90
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:10,350
Not a fingernail,not a hair fiber.

91
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:15,060
Acid is a very tidy way
of disposing of something.

92
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,530
Acid?

93
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,610
Are you saying that
you killed these women?

94
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:21,900
There is still time to
save the others,though.

95
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,120
Others?

96
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,070
5 more.

97
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,020
What do you mean?

98
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:32,280
In a bit less than 9 hours,5
other people are going to be dead.

99
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:37,070
Unless,you can find a way to save them.

You're my boss,correct?

108
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:35,350
Excuse me?

109
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:36,990
- I report to you.
- That's right.

110
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,800
Has my job performance been
to your satisfaction,sir?

111
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,900
It seems fine.

112
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,580
And if it weren't to your
satisfaction,you'd tell me?

113
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,730
I can promise you that.

114
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:46,210
Because i can do this job.

115
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,670
I'm sorry,has somebody
suggested that you can't?

116
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:50,500
Have they?

117
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,100
Not to me.

118
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,480
Thank you,sir.

119
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,280
What's wrong with agent todd?

120
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,930
I haven't really spent
a lot of time with her.

121
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,100
Something's bothering her.

122
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,620
I'll keep an eye on her.
You wanted to see me?

123
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,920
Yes. The houston case.

124
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,310
I'm missing the coroner's
supplemental for victim 3.

125
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,090
That's supposed to
come in this afternoon.

126
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,890
I just turned that in last night.

127
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:08,800
When do you sleep?

128
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,580
Get me that supplemental
so i can close the case.

129
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,730
- Yes,sir.
- Thank you.

130
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:16,300
hey,dave.

131
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:21,350
Reid and i were just approached by some guy here
with photos that he claims are 7 women he killed.

132
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:25,100
These pictures have all been manipulated in
some way that you can't really see what they are.

133
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,450
But he said he killed them?

134
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,000
7 women so far.

135
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,960
So far?

136
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,550
There are 5 more live victims
somewhere that we can save in 9 hours.

137
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:35,410
Is this guy for real,dave?
Is a confessor,wannabe?

138
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,460
I don't think so,hotch.

139
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,470
I get a hit off him. Something
hinky. I'm bringing him in.

140
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,610
Ok,what can i do?

141
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:43,010
I'm sending shots of the photos
to garcia to start looking over.

142
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,230
I'll let her know to expect them.

143
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:46,080
I'll see you in about 45 minutes.

144
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,310
What is this?

145
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:51,640
Do not forget a word he says
the rest of the time we have him.

146
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,590
It's obviously tank girl.

147
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:55,560
Tank girl?

148
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,150
Absolutamundo.

149
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,180
Is she even a good guy?

150
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,660
Um,"a," she's not a
guy at all. Big plus.

151
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:05,660
B,she is all about wild hair
dye,flatulence,nose picking,spitting,

152
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:10,170
explosive vomiting,Occasional random
sex,and more than occasional drunkenness.

153
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,410
And she has a tank.

154
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:13,040
Her very own tank.

155
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,030
And that,mon ami,is girl power.

156
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,700
Superman can fly.

157
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,610
Garcia.

158
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:22,940
Uh,thank you for the help
with the,uh,stuff thing.

159
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,440
You don't have to lie,kevin.

160
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,640
Kevin,if she's not busy,you can visit.

161
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,440
Right,sir,sorry.

162
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,750
Garcia,rossi's sending you some photos.

163
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,430
I need you to analyze them,see if
you can find anything identifiable.

164
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,970
They're possible homicide victims.

165
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:33,570
Possible?

166
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,200
Long story,most of
which i don't know yet.

167
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,970
- But the clock may be ticking.
- Yes,sir.

168
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,340
- Kevin.
- Yes,sir?

169
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,990
She's busy now.

170
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,470
Oh,right,right. Sorry.

171
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,810
Find something,garcia. There
may be 5 more victims out there.

172
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:50,020
Yes,sir.

173
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,400
So you said you're a
professor at strayer?

174
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,760
No.

175
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,480
You didn't?

176
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,570
No.

177
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:01,800
I mean,you did introduce yourself
as professor rothschild,right?

178
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,370
Your degree in philosophy
surprises me,dr. Reid.

179
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:08,030
It doesn't fit with
mathematics and engineering.

180
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,420
I kind of like it because
there's no right or wrong answers.

181
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,690
Without right or wrong,how
would we recognize perfection?

182
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:15,210
Is this fun for you?

183
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:15,900
Excuse me?

184
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,050
Are you having fun?

185
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:19,690
It's quite a bit more
complicated than that.

186
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:20,860
What do you mean?

187
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,100
You wouldn't understand.

188
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,030
Try me.

189
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,520
I read your books,david.

190
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,600
You're not of the intellectual
capacity to grasp what's going on here.

191
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,120
If you're trying to piss
me off,it's not gonna work.

192
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,260
But if you killed 7 women without leaving
a trace of evidence,why turn yourself in?

193
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:41,490
Imagine what the world would have
missed if da vinci never showed his work.

194
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,230
Hey,how's it going?

195
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:52,260
Why?

196
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:56,150
Um,it's just a question.

197
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:59,090
I'm sorry. I just...

198
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,940
Um,jordan,as the last
person to join this team,

199
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,800
i know how overwhelming
all of this can be.

200
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,700
It really does get easier.

201
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:15,090
I'm not exactly sure if
that's a good thing,though.

202
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:20,640
I'm gonna manifest happiness
and calm for the rest of the day.

203
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:23,010
Happiness and calm?

204
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:26,070
At the b.a.u.?
That's--good luck with that.

205
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:28,140
Oh,did you need something?

206
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,770
Oh,yeah.

207
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm waiting for a supplemental from the
houston field office so i can closeout a report.

208
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,840
If you could just let me
know when it gets here.

209
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,440
An internal report
wouldn't come through me.

210
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:43,300
Really?

211
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,670
- Thanks for checking up on me.
- Yeah,ok.

212
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,860
Well,if you need anything,i'm around.

213
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:58,570
Earlier this morning,police were contacted
and informed that kaylee robinson,

214
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:03,410
Who ran a daycare center out of her
home,had been abducted along with 4 children.

215
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:07,480
When a parent arrived at 9:30 this morning to
drop off her child,she discovered the door...

216
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,070
What's going on?

217
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:10,330
He said there were 5 more
victims we could save?

218
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:12,670
A woman was abducted this
morning in loretto,virginia.

219
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,140
She runs a home daycare center.

220
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,450
She had 4 children with her.

221
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:18,070
- They're all missing.
- All five.

222
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:21,080
Are those the 5 more?

223
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,770
Are you pissed off yet,david?

224
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,300
It's not your fault,you know.

225
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,470
Your iq is your iq.

226
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:43,150
It's not education,david,it's genetics.

227
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,410
What's this?

228
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,250
I need to explain what a pendant is?

229
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,560
What does it mean?

230
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,160
Mean?

231
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,610
It's just something i found at a fair.

232
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,920
Sit down.

233
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,350
You have the right to remain silent.

234
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,200
Anything you say can
be used against you.

235
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,820
You have the right to
have an attorney present.

236
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,330
If you cannot afford an attorney,one
will be appointed for you.

237
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,500
- Do you understand your rights-- -
genetics is the key to everything,david.

238
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,400
If you're not born
with the right--

239
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,030
- do you understand your rights?
- Perfectly.

240
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,440
I can have a lawyer. No,thank you.

241
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,580
Some games are just intended to
be played by higher intellects.

242
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,680
Harming a person weaker than you
doesn't take any special ability.

243
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,940
Neither does slamming
your fist down on a table.

244
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:28,950
But we all must do what we must do.

245
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:35,820
Bring dr. Reid back with you.

246
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,020
I never have any normal fans.

247
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,450
This guy loves the attention.

248
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,340
He has a god complex.

249
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,610
Sooner or later he'll give up something
important about kaylee and the kids.

250
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,440
Guys like him always do.

251
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,700
Before he hurts them?

252
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,820
1:45. He said we had till 10:00.

253
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,620
We need a button to push.

254
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,120
The 7 original homicides
could give us some leverage.

255
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,230
He says we'll never find any evidence
so he has nothing to worry about on them.

256
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:07,990
He made of point of saying there
are no bodies,no physical evidence.

257
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,700
We just have to show that
a crime was committed.

258
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,170
We can do that circumstantially.

259
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:15,160
We need to identify
the original 7 women.

260
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,140
Going back in there with
names just might shake him up.

261
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,360
How do we do that?

262
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,650
Reverse profiling.

263
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:23,360
Learn everything we can
about him and his methods

264
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,590
And then profile it back to what kind
of victim he would choose and from where.

265
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:30,550
From the unsub to the victim.

266
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:54,890
Ok,ok. Get this. Hurry,hurry,hurry.
Go,go,go. Come on with me.

267
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,510
Get to a mask.

268
00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:02,130
Hold your breath. Hold your breath.

269
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:05,670
I went through vicap.

270
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:08,820
There are literally thousands of open
missing women cases across the country.

271
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,880
It's not the entire country,though.

272
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,520
Kaylee was abducted
at 9:30 this morning.

273
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:15,180
He had time to take them somewhere,hide
them,and make it to fredericksburg 2 hours later.

274
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,920
He'd need a place with a lot
of privacy to hide 5 victims.

275
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,030
- A house.
- He's local.

276
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,450
He was late for the presentation.

277
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:23,120
You know,it was more like 2.
5 hours after the abduction.

278
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,130
He got there around noon,which puts
him somewhere around that radius.

279
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,350
Garcia,work up a map.

280
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,780
We need the farthest point he
could have taken kaylee from loretto

281
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,630
And still gotten back to
fredericksburg by noon.

282
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,590
Shouldn't be too hard.

283
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,800
All right,what do we know so far?

284
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,930
He's obsessively neat and clean.

285
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:41,290
He did research on reid and me at least.

286
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:45,840
He's abducted 5 people,and then gets to a
scheduled recruitment session at a specific time.

287
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,550
That's extensive pre-planning.

288
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,620
Did you find anything
in those pictures,garcia?

289
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,410
I can't even positively
say they're dead.

290
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:52,960
What about hair color?

291
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,180
All the ones that show
hair,they appear to be brunettes.

292
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,520
So is kaylee.

293
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:00,400
I'll start there. Brunettes from
central virginia that are missing.

294
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,240
Ident got zip on his prints.

295
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,010
He's not in any system. He's a ghost.

296
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:07,100
All right,if he hasn't been
fingerprinted,he hasn't been arrested.

297
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:11,220
Which also means he hasn't had a
passport,driver's license,or been in the military.

298
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,410
Never been a teacher,either.

299
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:13,990
You have to be fingerprinted
to be a teacher.

300
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,930
So he's a professor who doesn't teach.

301
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,690
What kind of professor doesn't teach?

302
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,360
A researcher? Someone on a grant,maybe.

303
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,730
a grant would give him the time.

304
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,410
There must be some sort
of central grant database.

305
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:25,210
I can't imagine the government
just handing out money and not--

306
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:26,020
I'll look into it.

307
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:30,250
From past conversations,we know he's
a narcissist and seemingly remorseless.

308
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:31,440
Psychopath.

309
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,000
You know,we can eliminate a lot
of these open missing persons Cases

310
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,350
if we could just figure
out how he met them.

311
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:40,650
Jordan,contact the loretto p.d.and get us
invitation to consult on the kaylee robinson case.

312
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,420
Be nice to them. They
don't have to let us.

313
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:45,800
And then you and morgan go down
there and find out what you can.

314
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,060
Let's go.

315
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,030
Prentiss,i need you
to do something for me.

316
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:50,790
Anything.

317
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,000
What's our strategy going to be
in there with the interrogation?

318
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,210
You're not gonna be in the room.

319
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:54,730
What do you mean?

320
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,540
That's what he wants. He
wants to play with you.

321
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,290
We have to knock him off his game.

322
00:16:58,410 --> 00:16:59,670
That's all we have right now.

323
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,780
He's right.

324
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:12,510
Ok,how far could he have gone from loretto
and make it back to fredericksburg by noon?

325
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:18,090
There must be some sort of
mathematical equation to do this.

326
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:21,310
Should have paid more
attention in algebra.

327
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:25,270
Note to self,get dr. Reid in here asap.

328
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,120
<i>INCOMING E-MAIL</i>

329
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,260
What the?

330
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,480
Golden rat?

331
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,340
Oh,no.

332
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,000
Where's dr. Reid?

333
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,700
Busy.

334
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,030
You have something going
on more important than me?

335
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:54,420
My dry cleaning is
more important than you.

336
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,710
That's very,very hostile.

337
00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:01,740
I think you're just a big-mouth wannabe who doesn't
have the guts to do anything at all about this.

338
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,830
Well,then i guess i'm free to go.

339
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:08,610
I didn't spend the last 5 years
of my life working on a masterpiece

340
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:14,230
Just to fold to a bad bluff,especially to
someone who doesn't even have a hand to play.

341
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:20,750
Agent prentiss,this is
professor rothschild.

342
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,350
May i?

343
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:25,550
A god like you doesn't have
a problem with women,does he?

344
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,020
Do i make you nervous?

345
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:30,460
It's ok,agent. I think we have
everything we need to know.

346
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:34,590
This is not a man who can
confront a woman on equal footing.

347
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:38,600
He sneaks up on them. Gets
them from behind. Blitz attacks.

348
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,940
The original 7 victims,oh,they were
alone when they came up missing.

349
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:47,520
They had a routine,and he watched them.

350
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,880
Hiding in the weeds like a snake.

351
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,240
Like... A coward.

352
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,930
That was a waste of precious time.

353
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:06,720
Oh,it's all part of
the game now,isn't it?

354
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,960
You think you know what
game you're plang,david?

355
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,590
You aren't even able to
grasp what questions to ask.

356
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,500
Such as?

357
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,620
How about asking what
the rules are,david?

358
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,250
Rules?

359
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,760
2:00

360
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:38,490
and then there were four.

361
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,790
I told you that in less than 10
hours another 5 people would be dead.

362
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:47,240
I never said they would
die at the same time.

363
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,310
It's ok.

364
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:54,280
I wonder which one it was-- the
woman or one of those precious babies.

365
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,950
You have to know the rules
to play the game,david.

366
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:07,330
Every 2 hours,one of them will die.

367
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:08,060
Chelsea!

368
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:13,440
In the end,they will all be gone.

369
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,050
Chelsea,honey!

370
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:18,570
Is there something else i need to know?

371
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:27,080
Only that i'm rooting for you... David.

372
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:35,310
it just popped up on
the screen. It's them.

373
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:37,100
There are only 3 children.

374
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,860
There were four when
i went to go get you.

375
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,080
What is this on their faces?

376
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,170
they look like gas masks.

377
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:44,740
Why would you fill a place with
gas and then provide gas masks?

378
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,460
Well,maybe the gas
serves another purpose.

379
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,070
Such as?

380
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,660
Well,look how evenly they're spaced out.

381
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,020
And the hoses are stretched as far
as they can go without coming off.

382
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:54,360
The masks are to keep
them in specific positions.

383
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,190
He said one of them is already dead.

384
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,040
One of the five.

385
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,560
- There are only 3 children.
- Is this them?

386
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,420
an anonymous site emailed to me.

387
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,980
He said one will die every
2 hours,not all five in ten.

388
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,710
When he said 10
hours,i just assumed--

389
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,360
it's a chess game,he's 2 moves ahead.

390
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,680
Let's not get diverted.

391
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,120
How we doing with the
seven missing women?

392
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:15,910
So far,i've got 39 missing
brunettes in central virginia.

393
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,520
Ok,30 years old like kaylee.

394
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,150
Narcissists tend to be
extremely preferential.

395
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,460
- 28.
- he said he's been working on this for 5 years.

396
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,820
Over the last 5 years,17.

397
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,890
All right,if he thinks he's going to jail
for even one of the original 7 homicides,

398
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:30,690
Maybe he'll tell us where the rest of
them are and give himself some deal room.

399
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:32,020
How long do we have until the next one?

400
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,920
One hour,48 minutes.

401
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,740
Dave,can i speak to you for a second?

402
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,020
How do you think it's going in there?

403
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,750
All right.

404
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,770
Do you feel like you're making progress?

405
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,120
Some.

406
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,500
I was thinking maybe we
should give reid a shot.

407
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,480
You think he's smarter than me?

408
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,030
No.

409
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,990
Intelligence is just
part of the profile.

410
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,040
We're not talking about intelligence.

411
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:05,460
We're not changing in midstream,hotch.
I have a rapport. This is my interview.

412
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,590
Ok.

413
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:13,750
Let me know if there's
anything we can do.

414
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,710
Thanks,ma'am,we're around the corner.

415
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:30,290
The husband and the local
p.d.are all at the crime scene.

416
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:32,510
- They're waiting for you.
- Us.

417
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:36,030
- What?
- Us. They're waiting for us.

418
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:39,070
You told that detective this morning that
you would present his case to the team,

419
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:41,010
And if they were
interested,you would call him.

420
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:42,490
Look,interested wasn't the right word.

421
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:43,320
I get that.

422
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,850
I won't make that mistake again.

423
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:46,500
Jordan...

424
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,930
You are a member of this team.

425
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:52,000
There is no "they." It's "we."

426
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,940
It's important for you to know that.

427
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:05,840
Do you know that i was born
with an extra y chromosome?

428
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,840
So?

429
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,210
You don't know what that means?

430
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:09,720
It doesn't mean anything.

431
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,380
It means...

432
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,100
I was born to be a killer.

433
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,150
Now that's funny.

434
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,060
Oh,no,no,no.

435
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:21,480
Don't pretend you don't
know what i'm talking about.

436
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,230
I have an extra y,it makes me a killer.

437
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:26,880
That's junk science; a joke.

438
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,320
It was debunked years ago.

439
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,960
So you don't believe
that killing is genetic?

440
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,970
It's not a matter of me
believing it. It isn't true.

441
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:38,110
Killing someone or not
killing someone is a choice.

442
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:43,620
If those people die,it's because
you chose to make it happen.

443
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:51,030
Margaret peters,another
gloucester point.

444
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:53,970
Disappeared in 2006 on her way to work.

445
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:56,440
Last seen at the coffee shop
she went to every morning.

446
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,120
Check.

447
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,130
That's number six. We need one more.

448
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,250
Husband?

449
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:15,670
I'll go talk to him.

450
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,930
You want me to,um...

451
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:20,040
I'll be fine.

452
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,440
Right.

453
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,330
All these toys were left just like this?

454
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:42,470
We didn't move them.

455
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,900
Husband doesn't know
anything. He was at work.

456
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:48,240
Doors were found open when somebody
tried to drop another child off.

457
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,900
These kids are 6 years old,right?

458
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,380
All four of them.

459
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,790
It's just an odd pattern
for kids to leave toys in.

460
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:54,950
Mean anything to you?

461
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:57,320
Not to me.

462
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:10,180
Ricky,ricky,look at me!

463
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,310
Run all the way here for me.

464
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:14,320
Can you do that? Ok? Come on!

465
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:20,140
Ok,come on! Run,run! Run,run,run!

466
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,490
Stay,stay,stay.

467
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,850
She put herself closest to the
end,farthest from the camera.

468
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:36,470
Why?

469
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:38,910
Maybe she knows something we don't,like
she doesn't have a lot of time.

470
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:39,750
Let's continue.

471
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,500
Uh,lindsay connor.

472
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:45,220
She was last seen when she stepped out to have
a cigarette while having a blown tire fixed.

473
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,860
Doesn't sound like something routine.

474
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:51,110
Lisa mcdaniel,saluda,went missing
early 2008 while on her daily jog.

475
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,100
Oh,she fits.

476
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,650
That's seven,including
kaylee,that makes 8.

477
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,120
They're all incredibly beautiful.

478
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,070
Almost unnaturally.

479
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:03,910
What are the chances that three out of
our seven victims are from the same town?

480
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,630
What's the population of saluda?

481
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,550
Middlesex county is
small,but it's near water.

482
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:10,990
A lot of people have boats
there and weekend homes.

483
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:13,750
And two from gloucester point.

484
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:17,800
Morgan just sent this to
me from the robinson house.

485
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,940
Without right or wrong,how
would we recognize perfection?

486
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,630
Perfection.

487
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:34,870
Analytical minds such as ours...

488
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:07,440
1-1-2-3-5.

489
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:11,890
Does that mean something?

490
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,870
Dr. Reid...

491
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:22,170
I know where to find them.

492
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:31,340
garcia,can you put the map
of virginia up on screen?

493
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,520
It's an irrational
number known as "phi."

494
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,970
It's based on the ratio of line
segments to each other and of the whole.

495
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,690
It's called the golden ratio.

496
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:42,900
Golden rat-- that's the
web address,goldenrat. Net.

497
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,520
It's a ratio found all through life.

498
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,670
In fact,many people that we find conventionally
attractive are proportioned based on that ratio.

499
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:52,280
He,uh,he made a reference to
leonardo da vinci,remember this?

500
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,760
Da vinci used it in a
lot of his paintings.

501
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,470
A matter of fact,the
last supper--

502
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,970
Reid,reid,how do we find them?

503
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:00,290
The whole concept is
represented by this pendant,

504
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:04,660
Including the logarithmic spiral
created by using a fibonacci sequence.

505
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,670
Follow me on this.

506
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:07,890
- You can manipulate this image,right?
- Tell me what you need.

507
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:10,430
Pull up all the towns
that the missings are from.

508
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:11,470
Wonderful.

509
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,350
We had one in richmond.

510
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:16,620
One in dinwiddie,then
two in gloucester point,

511
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,280
and three in saluda,and finally
5 in loretto this morning.

512
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,060
1-1-2-3-5 is a
fibonacci series.

513
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,810
Each number added to
the number before it.

514
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:26,990
It's what his ticks mean.

515
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:30,920
He's subconsciously counting off the fibonacci
sequence in his head over and over again.

516
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,640
Now geometrically,it can
be expressed as a spiral.

517
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,860
It's called a logarithmic spiral.

518
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,510
Can you put the spiral
up on the map? Thanks.

519
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:42,190
Ok,now flip it 180 degrees.

520
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:45,960
Now make it bigger.
Bigger,just a little bit bigger.

521
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,690
Stop,stop,stop.

522
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:52,140
The pendant is like a key.

523
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,860
Chester,virginia.

524
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:54,650
You're sure?

525
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:58,370
With his level of obsession with these numbers,the
ratio will have permeated his entire life.

526
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:01,910
If we took a city map of chester,the location
where kaylee And her children are being held

527
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:04,340
will follow one of these
points on that map as well.

528
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,860
The ratio works with any scale at all.

529
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:07,840
Morgan and todd are closer.

530
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,430
Call them and tell
them to get to chester.

531
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:10,800
I'm gonna get a chopper ready.

532
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,290
Reid and prentiss,get a
city map and you're with me.

533
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:16,280
There's still something...

534
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,130
Bugging me about this.

535
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:28,140
- Chester,virginia.
- What?

536
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,320
The whole team is going there.

537
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,250
I see.

538
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:35,600
They'll be there before 4:00;
before the next deadline.

539
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,580
You lose.

540
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:43,030
Explain something to me-- this
is all about a geometric pattern?

541
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:46,370
Phi is much more than a
geometric pattern,david.

542
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:52,030
Killing all those women--
kaylee robinson,the first seven?

543
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,040
You killed them because
they were beautiful?

544
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,550
You mean hypothetically?

545
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:58,200
Well,i'm just trying to
understand this math thing.

546
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,120
All animals desperately need a way
to detect others of their species.

547
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,750
Dogs have scent,dolphins have sound.

548
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:11,670
Golden ratio is a subconscious
identifier of perfect humanness.

549
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:17,640
If i had done all these things,it
wouldn't be because they were beautiful.

550
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:22,460
It would be because they were
perfect examples of humanity.

551
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,210
Because they're human?

552
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:26,300
Hypothetically speaking.

553
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,290
This doesn't make any sense to me.

554
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:31,950
Killing a human because they're human?

555
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:36,480
Do you know what homo sapiens
sapiens actually means,david?

556
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,080
Its literal translation?

557
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,060
No.

558
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:42,550
Man,wise,wise.

559
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:43,800
Think about that.

560
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,830
We named ourselves doubly wise.

561
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:50,480
We are twice as wise as every
other creature on the planet.

562
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:54,660
The hubris,the arrogance.

563
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,820
Humans are a blight.

564
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,380
We should all be eradicated.

565
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,400
You hate humanity?

566
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,120
Every bit as much as you do.

567
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,550
I don't hate humanity.

568
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:07,250
I told you,i read all of your books.

569
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:09,100
It's in there,every one of them.

570
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:12,230
Your hatred.

571
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:17,830
Your first book,chapter 3,page 89,

572
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:22,000
1,3...89.

573
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,680
all fibonacci numbers.

574
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,580
"the first time i saw one
of william grace's victims,

575
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:31,520
"i knew i was looking at
the residue of pure evil.

576
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:37,340
"i would never again feel completely
safe around a human being."

577
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:41,460
This is all about my books?

578
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:44,930
Like you,i know exactly what
human beings are capable of.

579
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:50,060
I can hate the things people
do,but have pity for who they are.

580
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,320
Pity?

581
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,330
You pity them?

582
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:59,920
Any man who feels that the only
way to have power or purpose

583
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,220
is to hurt others deserves pity.

584
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:07,990
Your fifth book,chapter 13,page 144.

585
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:13,090
"i know it makes little sense to try
and deter violence with more violence.

586
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:17,400
"But deterrence is not why i
believe in the death penalty.

587
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:21,800
"there are some people
that are so violent,so evil,

588
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:25,430
"that society has no choice
but to be done with them.

589
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:29,710
"Vengeance is something
that society needs

590
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:34,490
"from time to time,if,for
no other purpose,

591
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:38,220
"than to keep the rest of us sane.

592
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,820
"Where is the pity?"

593
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:44,230
Sir,they found the house. You were
right. They're going inside now.

594
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:46,560
Thank you.

595
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:51,530
Vengeance keeps us sane.

596
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:55,580
What a fascinating statement.

597
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,670
You may have your vengeance,

598
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:02,960
as i am about to have...Mine.

599
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:04,650
What?

600
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:08,080
They're never going to make
it out of that house,david.

601
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:13,520
It was never about that perfect
woman or those wonderful children.

602
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,400
It is about your team.

603
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,140
Your merry band of five.

604
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:22,510
They complete my sequence.

605
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:30,050
Garcia,get hotch on the phone,now!

606
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:31,930
It's too late,david.

607
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:35,170
The minute they stepped into
that house,they were dead.

608
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:40,730
I knew if i kept prodding you that
you would rise to my challenge.

609
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:41,940
Hotch isn't answering.

610
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,730
- Try morgan.
- I knew...

611
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:47,260
That you would insist on being
in the room alone with me;

612
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,190
that you would try to beat me.

613
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:52,400
I knew you would send
them all out there.

614
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,530
No,nothing.

615
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:54,930
Try prentiss or reid!

616
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:56,740
It's a trap,stop them!

617
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:59,610
But you're not just
filled with hatred,david.

618
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:01,870
You're also filled with arrogance.

619
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:05,870
Hubris,just like every
other human being.

620
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:07,240
Just like me.

621
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,490
I can't reach anyone!

622
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:09,350
Try again!

623
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:11,910
They're never going to answer.

624
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:14,670
You lose.

625
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:20,420
Why? What did i ever do?

626
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:25,080
William grace.

627
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,620
The man you called
the face of pure evil.

628
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,380
My brother.

629
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,700
My life ended the day you arrested him.

630
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:36,230
Every time people talked
about william grace,

631
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:39,790
they always talked about his
parents and his brother henry.

632
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:44,900
Because no one could believe that anyone
that evil could possibly hide in the darkness.

633
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:48,650
Surely someone must have
seen,someone must have known--

634
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:51,920
Surely his own brother.

635
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,740
I had a fianc\,david.

636
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,580
A beautiful woman.

637
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:00,520
A perfect woman.

638
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,990
She sent the ring back to me.

639
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:07,340
She said she was afraid
to give it to me in person.

640
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,940
She was afraid of me.

641
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,510
She was a brunette.

642
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:15,390
So then i started getting
these thoughts,these ideas,

643
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:19,850
these images inside my head.

644
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:23,210
I couldn't--i
couldn't escape them.

645
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:27,230
And then i realized,

646
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:32,060
my brother hadn't been
alone in the darkness.

647
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:38,980
I shared the same genetics
you so casually dismiss.

648
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,420
I started a second life.

649
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:44,300
No one knew,but something...

650
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:48,080
Was missing. I couldn't figure it out.

651
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:51,570
And then...

652
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:57,760
David rossi,the man that ruined my life.

653
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:03,870
And suddenly,i knew what
it was that was missing.

654
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:06,550
Because you...

655
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:10,060
Have written it.

656
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,080
Vengeance.

657
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,140
Vengeance.

658
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:28,650
You murdered all those
women just because of me?

659
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:33,530
That's right.

660
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:37,770
I killed 12 people...

661
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:40,130
'Cause of you.

662
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:43,670
You took my family.

663
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:46,870
I take yours.

664
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:54,750
Did you get all that?

665
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,710
Every word,boss.

666
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:59,530
Well,make copies before we
give it to the u.s.attorney.

667
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:02,300
This might make a
pretty good teaching aid.

668
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,250
Yes,sir.

669
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:05,260
Teaching?

670
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:10,300
Yeah. I teach interrogation
at the fbi academy.

671
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:12,790
Hotch...

672
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:14,580
Garcia said i got it right?

673
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,660
Yeah,about everything.

674
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,180
We found the acid tanks around back.

675
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,410
The acid would have covered
the whole area outside the room.

676
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:23,140
There were spigots everywhere.
The entry was booby-trapped.

677
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,940
And what about kaylee and the kids?

678
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:27,380
They're fine. Oh,they're fine.
You were right about them.

679
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,670
They were just one of the decoys.

680
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:32,180
That was reid who figured out
his obsession with those numbers.

681
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:35,050
He wasn't about to kill
10 people this afternoon.

682
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,080
That's not in the pattern.

683
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,440
You get your confession?

684
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,880
Took some doing. Thank you.

685
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:48,780
You'd be charged with kidnapping,but
kaylee and the kids,they're all safe.

686
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,930
You'll only face murder charges
on the original seven women.

687
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:53,350
With no evidence?

688
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:57,930
Yeah.You,uh,you mentioned
that when we first met,

689
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:02,750
that we would never be
able to get you on those.

690
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,730
But i think you'll discover
that the videotaped confession

691
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:11,680
has the power to move a lot of jurors.

692
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,240
You waited until i turned
my back,didn't you,henry?

693
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,640
Just like you did with those women.

694
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,170
Don't give me a reason to hurt you!

695
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:33,700
And one
more thing--

696
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:36,960
I'm going to be there when they strap
you down for that lethal injection.

697
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,070
And just before they hit the plunger,

698
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:42,250
I'm going to lean in
really close and tell you

699
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:46,740
to say hello to your scumbag brother.

700
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:02,500
First solo case.

701
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:05,120
They don't always turn
out so well,do they?

702
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,450
I wish.

703
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:10,900
I was out of line with you this morning.

704
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,540
No,you weren't. You were right.

705
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,820
I should have never jumped in like that.

706
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,520
And it won't happen again.

707
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,790
So what do you think?

708
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:20,670
What do i think about what?

709
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:22,160
- The other case.
- What case?

710
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,640
Told that detective that you'd take
a look at it and give him a call.

711
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,240
Jordan,are you serious?
I've been a little busy.

712
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,570
The man is waiting for a phone call.

713
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:31,630
You told him you'd call him personally.

714
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:33,730
Am i ever gonna catch a break with you?

715
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:35,410
I can dial the number if you'd like.

716
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:38,740
I mean,aren't you supervisory
special agent morgan?

717
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:42,800
- This is going to be interesting.
- Yeah.

718
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:47,580
I want you to speak when you mean
it. That's what i want you to do.

719
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,080
Sir.

720
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:10,140
"man must evolve for
all human conflict "

721
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:14,780
a method which rejects
revenge,aggression,and retaliation."

722
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:18,310
The foundation of
such a method is love."

723
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:20,820
Martin luther king,jr.
