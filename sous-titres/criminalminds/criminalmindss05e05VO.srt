Hey, you.

00:00:59,567 --> 00:01:02,033
How are you doing?

Don't! no! let me just--

Baton rouge thinks they have
a white supremacist problem.

00:01:55,667 --> 00:01:57,501
What's your take?

33
00:01:57,567 --> 00:01:58,534
Really?

34
00:01:58,601 --> 00:02:00,000
Yeah, i'd like to hear it.

35
00:02:00,067 --> 00:02:02,033
We're dealing with
an individual, not a group.

36
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,267
Why?

37
00:02:03,334 --> 00:02:04,767
The angry letters.

38
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:08,434
The writer switches

to singular.

armed militia,"</i>

40

<i>followed by, "i will be
forced to take action."</i>

41
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,100
Good. send it back
to the police with our analysis.

42
00:02:15,167 --> 00:02:16,934
What else?

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,200
You need to be somewhere?

44
00:02:19,267 --> 00:02:21,334

through a clingy stage.

47

Oh, no, no, no.
we only have 5 more cases.
we can crank 'em out.

48
00:02:27,868 --> 00:02:29,634
We can do this tomorrow.
please go home.

49
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:31,400
Ok. thank you.

50
00:02:31,467 --> 00:02:33,567
I just have one last
distribution
and i'm out of here.

00:02:33,634 --> 00:02:34,801
Good night.

52
00:02:34,868 --> 00:02:36,400

we need to talk.

00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:51,367

Is everything ok?

64
00:03:33,267 --> 00:03:34,634
Yes, everything's fine.

Oh, man, you're not
gonna believe this.

75
00:04:21,167 --> 00:04:24,133
Some moron just posted
a blog called
"what would carl sagan do?"

76
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,434
No, reid, the case.
what's the case?

77
00:04:26,501 --> 00:04:27,767
What are you talking about?

78
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,067
These emails from hotch.
"take a look at this,"

79
00:04:29,133 --> 00:04:30,267
"new case to review."

80
00:04:30,334 --> 00:04:31,367

I didn't get any emails
from hotch, did i?

82
00:04:33,501 --> 00:04:35,634
Nothing.

83
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:41,634
Come in.

84
00:04:41,701 --> 00:04:43,734
Did you, uh, get a chance
to look at the files?

85
00:04:43,801 --> 00:04:45,033
I just got them.
what's so important

86
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,734
You couldn't send it
to the rest of the team?

87
00:04:46,801 --> 00:04:48,934
I just needed
a second pair of eyes.

88
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,334
I'll review it right now.
just give me an hour.

89
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,734
That's not necessary.

90
00:04:52,801 --> 00:04:54,334
We're ready.

00:04:59,334 --> 00:05:01,501
Kristie taylor,

00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,067
Reported missing from
farmington, new mexico

93
00:05:03,133 --> 00:05:04,400
3 years ago.

94
00:05:04,467 --> 00:05:06,601
Yesterday, she turned up
off a freeway

95
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:08,501
Outside of rio rancho.

96
00:05:08,567 --> 00:05:11,601
Sexual assault combined
with ligature marks
on her wrists and ankles.

97
00:05:11,667 --> 00:05:12,667
She was asphyxiated.

98
00:05:12,734 --> 00:05:15,133
3 victims in 5 years.

99
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,767
All the women
are connected by marks.

100
00:05:16,834 --> 00:05:18,667
He likes chains.

101
00:05:18,734 --> 00:05:20,601
Definite sexual sadist.

102
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:23,467
He sticks to his type.
16- to 19-year-old girls,
all blond.

103
00:05:23,534 --> 00:05:25,167
Hangs on to them
for a while, too.

00:05:25,234 --> 00:05:26,434
Look at this.

Between abducting them
and killing them.

Low body count,
long time frame.

107
00:05:29,734 --> 00:05:31,601
This guy's in control
of his urges.

108
00:05:31,667 --> 00:05:32,934
Too controlled.

109
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,200
Sadists need new victims,
new ways to torture.

110
00:05:36,267 --> 00:05:37,934
There are a lot of guys
out there who like chains.

111
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,200
Are we sure this is
the same unsub?

112
00:05:39,267 --> 00:05:40,934
Kristie taylor's
autopsy report

113
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,667
Also indicates
a second connection
between these victims.

114
00:05:43,734 --> 00:05:45,167
She was pregnant.

115
00:05:45,234 --> 00:05:47,968
She'd given birth.
very soon after,
the unsub killed her.

116
00:05:48,033 --> 00:05:49,400
How soon after?

117
00:05:49,467 --> 00:05:50,667
Minutes.

118
00:05:50,734 --> 00:05:53,434
This unsub isn't your
typical sexual sadist.

119
00:05:53,501 --> 00:05:54,901
Captivity and assault
we've seen before.

120
00:05:54,968 --> 00:05:57,133
What we haven't seen
is this signature--

121
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,767
The role he forces
these women to fulfill
before he kills them.

122
00:06:00,834 --> 00:06:03,033
Motherhood.

123

And why his parents

130
00:06:51,634 --> 00:06:54,934
So why would a sexual sadist
make women carry his children?

131
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,100
Gary heidnik kept a harem
in a dungeon.

132
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,767
His goal was to create
a large family

133
00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:00,834
As a replacement for
his own broken home.

134
00:07:00,901 --> 00:07:03,267
Josef fritzl kept his daughter
in a cell in his own house,

135
00:07:03,334 --> 00:07:04,767
And they had several kids
together.

136
00:07:04,834 --> 00:07:06,200
Squalid conditions
are part

137
00:07:06,267 --> 00:07:08,234
Of a control fantasy
these men had.

138
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,367
If he's keeping these women
in a similar location,

139
00:07:10,434 --> 00:07:12,234
He'd need
a lot of privacy.

140
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,234
Morgan: he probably
built it himself.

141
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,767
Makes him good with his hands.

142
00:07:15,834 --> 00:07:17,767
Why blondes,
and what significance
do they have to him?

143
00:07:17,834 --> 00:07:19,968
Maybe, uh, the woman
who rejected him

144
00:07:20,033 --> 00:07:22,400
Or the woman who wouldn't
bear his children?

145
00:07:22,467 --> 00:07:24,868
If that were true, he'd be
the same age as these girls--

146
00:07:24,934 --> 00:07:26,033
Late teens.

147
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,634
This unsub is too skilled
for that.

148
00:07:27,701 --> 00:07:28,968
His own mother, then?

149
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:31,701
She could be a runaway,
just like these victims.

150
00:07:31,767 --> 00:07:33,167
Which makes his compulsion
psych 101--

151
00:07:33,234 --> 00:07:35,801
Killing his mother
over and over again
for giving birth to him.

152
00:07:35,868 --> 00:07:38,133
Yeah, but then why wait
until after she gives birth?

153
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,734
Now he has a body
and a baby to get rid of.

154
00:07:40,801 --> 00:07:43,467
That troubles me, too.
we found the mothers
but not the infants.

155

Uh, i hate to say this,

156
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,868
But what if the women are
just a means to an end?

157
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:51,334
What if the babies
are really the ones
he's exploiting?

158
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,000
If kristie taylor
just surfaced,

159
00:07:53,067 --> 00:07:55,634
It means he has her baby
right now.

160
00:07:55,701 --> 00:07:57,267
Jj, check with the parents.
see if there are
any similarities

161
00:07:57,334 --> 00:07:59,701
In the runaways' patterns,
where the unsub's
finding them.

162
00:07:59,767 --> 00:08:01,701
Reid and prentiss,
go to the latest dump site.

163
00:08:01,767 --> 00:08:03,667
We need to look
at victimology.

164
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:06,367
How he treats these women
in the final moments
of their lives

165
00:08:06,434 --> 00:08:08,534
Might tell us what he's
doing to the children.

166
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:10,267
Doctor, you wrote
in your report

167
00:08:10,334 --> 00:08:12,133
That kristie had had
several miscarriages.

168
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,434
How was that evident?

169
00:08:13,501 --> 00:08:15,767
There were a number of abrasions
in her uterine lining.

170
00:08:15,834 --> 00:08:18,000
Around the third trimester,
her water would break.

171
00:08:18,067 --> 00:08:20,100
So she never
carried to term?

172
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,567
No, last time she did.

173
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,234
There was a high level
of pitocin in her blood.

174
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,701
It's an artificial hormone.
you give it to induce labor.

175
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:28,501
She was on a tight schedule?

176
00:08:28,567 --> 00:08:30,834
If she lost the baby,
he would get her pregnant
again immediately.

177
00:08:30,901 --> 00:08:32,434
Childbirth is tough enough.

178
00:08:32,501 --> 00:08:34,934
Imagine if your life
depends upon it.

179
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,133
All 3 moms had records.

180
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,734
Drug abuse,
drunk and disorderlies.

181
00:08:37,801 --> 00:08:40,501
But what's more interesting
is what he does after
he kidnaps them.

182
00:08:40,567 --> 00:08:45,000
This is kristie taylor
2 weeks before
she was abducted.

183
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:46,667
Hotch: he got her healthy.

184
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:48,133
Well-fed and off
the habit.

185
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,067
Not completely.

186
00:08:50,133 --> 00:08:53,601
These drugs
in kristie's system--
what are they?

187
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:55,501
Tamoxifen, metoclopramide,

188
00:08:55,567 --> 00:08:56,901
Domperidone, progesterone.

189
00:08:56,968 --> 00:08:59,767
Progesterone's a prenatal
medication, isn't it?

190
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:02,767
They all are.
the first 2 help carry
the baby to term.

191
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,434
The last 2
help with lactation.

192
00:09:05,501 --> 00:09:06,934
What kind of sexual sadist

193
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,667
Gives his victims
prenatal drugs?

194
00:09:08,734 --> 00:09:10,934
The kind who takes care
of the kids he's having.

195
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,934
He gets his rocks off
killing the moms,

196
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,334
But the babies he protects.

197
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,534
You think he's keeping them?

198
00:09:16,601 --> 00:09:17,834
If he despises the moms,

199
00:09:17,901 --> 00:09:19,734
He'd despise
their children, too.

200
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:21,033
New mexico's
right on the border.

201
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,434
A lot of human
trafficking going on.

202
00:09:23,501 --> 00:09:25,267
This tight schedule
he keeps the moms on--

203
00:09:25,334 --> 00:09:26,601
He could be breeding.

204
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:28,534
Call child protection
services.

205
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:31,300
We need to find out about
existing black markets
for infants.

206
00:09:31,367 --> 00:09:33,200
Thank you.

207
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,634
There's no tire tracks.

208
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,534
The body wasn't dumped
that far from the road.

209
00:09:38,601 --> 00:09:40,434
This guy doesn't
care about them,

210
00:09:40,501 --> 00:09:41,801
Not enough to even
hide them very well.

211
00:09:41,868 --> 00:09:43,467
That's why this doesn't
make any sense.

212
00:09:43,534 --> 00:09:45,801
Dump sites reveal something
about the unsub, you know?

213
00:09:45,868 --> 00:09:47,868
At the very least,
a geographic familiarity,

214
00:09:47,934 --> 00:09:49,968
A place he knows
he won't get caught.

215
00:09:50,033 --> 00:09:51,767
Ok, so he knows this road.

216
00:09:51,834 --> 00:09:55,300
Yeah, except he abducted
kristie in farmington

217
00:09:55,367 --> 00:09:56,968
And then dumps her here
in rio rancho.

218
00:09:57,033 --> 00:09:58,601
It's a 175-mile drive.

219
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:00,801
Why drive that far
just to dump a body
by the side of the road?

220
00:10:00,868 --> 00:10:03,767
A forensic countermeasure?
covering his tracks
by sheer distance?

221
00:10:03,834 --> 00:10:06,501
So the geographical profile
won't do us much good.

222
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:08,167
No, it will,

223
00:10:08,234 --> 00:10:09,601
Just not
with the victims.

224
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:12,000
We profiled that
it's the babies that
he's interested in.

225
00:10:12,067 --> 00:10:14,200
That's where
he'll reveal himself.

226
00:10:14,267 --> 00:10:16,334
The adoption company
he sells through

227
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,300
And whatever network
of resources he uses.

228
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,033
He makes shortcuts
there for convenience.

229
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,834
No one's gonna drive
100 miles for diapers

230
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:23,767
Or for a public notary
for legal paperwork.

231
00:10:23,834 --> 00:10:25,868
If the babies
are in the system,
they'll lead us to him.

232
00:10:25,934 --> 00:10:27,334
Child trafficking

233
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,934
Is huge
in other countries,

234
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,834
But here
it's mostly a myth.

235
00:10:30,901 --> 00:10:32,267
Why is that?

236
00:10:32,334 --> 00:10:34,167
There's an easier
and legal path--

237
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:35,367
Adoption.

238
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:37,334
There'd be a paper trail,
though, wouldn't there?

239
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,501
There are ways
to hide your tracks.

240
00:10:39,567 --> 00:10:42,067
There must be a way
to identify all these kids.

241
00:10:42,133 --> 00:10:43,701
There's a court record
for every adoption.

242
00:10:43,767 --> 00:10:44,767
Give us the records.

243
00:10:44,834 --> 00:10:46,667
We'll start weeding
them out by date.

244
00:10:46,734 --> 00:10:49,300
The adoptions
in this state are closed.

245
00:10:49,367 --> 00:10:51,467
The files are sealed.
so it'll take time.

246
00:10:51,534 --> 00:10:53,434
That's a luxury
we don't have.

247
00:10:53,501 --> 00:10:55,467
There's a child
at risk right now.

248
00:10:55,534 --> 00:10:58,133
All children who go in
and out of the adoption system

249
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,367
Get basic genetic screenings
for pre-existing conditions.

250
00:11:01,434 --> 00:11:02,968
We have their dna.

251
00:11:03,033 --> 00:11:05,968
We can use that.
we can match
the maternal dna

252
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:07,400
With the babies
in the system.

253
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:09,367
We're still talking
hundreds of kids.

254
00:11:09,434 --> 00:11:11,834
What if we give you
one of the babies' dna?

255
00:11:11,901 --> 00:11:14,000
That would make it
go faster, yeah.

256
00:11:14,067 --> 00:11:16,667
He kills these moms so soon
after they give birth,

257
00:11:16,734 --> 00:11:19,200
Secondary dna could
still be on their bodies.

258
00:11:19,267 --> 00:11:21,167
I'll call the m.e.

259
00:11:21,234 --> 00:11:24,534
I understand.
thank you, doctor.

260
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,200
Agent jareau?

261
00:11:26,267 --> 00:11:27,567
I'm conrad winmar.

262
00:11:27,634 --> 00:11:29,000
This is my wife jane.

263
00:11:29,067 --> 00:11:32,067
Thank you
for coming in.

264
00:11:34,601 --> 00:11:37,567
Why don't we talk
privately?

265
00:11:43,567 --> 00:11:47,367
You--you want to
dig up our dauter?

266
00:11:47,434 --> 00:11:50,267
We think the unsub
might have left dna
on her.

267
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,734
The last 2 victims
didn't have any,

268
00:11:52,801 --> 00:11:55,300
But because monica
was the first,

269
00:11:55,367 --> 00:11:57,567
He might have
made a mistake.

270
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,801
Back when they found her,

271
00:11:59,868 --> 00:12:02,067
The detectives said that
they did not find his dna.

272
00:12:02,133 --> 00:12:06,234
It's not his dna
we're looking for.

273
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,100
We suspect your daughter
gave birth while
she was captive.

274
00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:11,801
What?

275
00:12:11,868 --> 00:12:16,267
The unsub has gotten all
of his victims pregnant.

276
00:12:17,367 --> 00:12:19,300
He might be
putting the babies

277
00:12:19,367 --> 00:12:21,934
In the adoption system.

278
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,334
The baby's alive?

279
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,834
Possibly.

280
00:12:24,901 --> 00:12:28,534
If we could find
placental tissue
on monica,

281
00:12:28,601 --> 00:12:29,968
We can test the dna

282
00:12:30,033 --> 00:12:32,634
Against
the state's records.

283
00:12:32,701 --> 00:12:35,300
Give us the release.

284
00:12:35,367 --> 00:12:36,767
The first time i saw her,

285
00:12:36,834 --> 00:12:39,234
Saw her record, too.

286
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,934
Thought she was just
another girl on the street,

287
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,801
Not caring what
she did to herself.

288
00:12:43,868 --> 00:12:46,167
I never even thought
to look for this.

289
00:12:46,234 --> 00:12:47,467
What is it?

290
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:50,334
It's a baby's umbilical cord.

291
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,701
The child should be
about 4 now.

292
00:12:52,767 --> 00:12:54,968
I hope you find him or her.

293
00:12:55,033 --> 00:12:57,501
I really do.

294
00:12:57,567 --> 00:12:59,467
Thank you.
mm.

295
00:12:59,534 --> 00:13:00,968
Garcia: ok, know this--

296
00:13:01,033 --> 00:13:02,801
Most adoption folk
are like the nicest,

297
00:13:02,868 --> 00:13:04,634
Most dedicated people
in the world.

298
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:06,501
There are, however,
one or two skeezy ones.

299
00:13:06,567 --> 00:13:07,734
How skeezy?

300
00:13:07,801 --> 00:13:10,234
Super skeezy. i've got
a spread sheet from one of them

301
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,033
Expecting compensation
for the baby i'm having.

302
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,167
Something you want
to tell me, garcia?

303
00:13:14,234 --> 00:13:16,033
Oh, that's the sad part,
my prince.

304
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,033
The genetically perfect
offspring

305
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,534
Of penelope garcia
and derek morgan

306
00:13:19,601 --> 00:13:21,033
Wouldn't fetch top dollar.

307
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,133
Who does?

308
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,467
White babies
are in higher demand

309
00:13:23,534 --> 00:13:24,801
Than minorities.

310
00:13:24,868 --> 00:13:26,467
Boys are more popular
than girls,

311
00:13:26,534 --> 00:13:27,734
At least this year, anyway.

312
00:13:27,801 --> 00:13:30,067
And then there's
the swedish supermodel rule.

313
00:13:30,133 --> 00:13:31,634
The what?

314
00:13:31,701 --> 00:13:34,400
If i were to deliver
a blond-haired, blue-eyed
bundle of joy,

315
00:13:34,467 --> 00:13:36,234
I'd be set for life.
i would.

316
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,467
Garcia,
did the baby's dna

317
00:13:37,534 --> 00:13:39,567
Turn up in new mexico's
adoption records?

318
00:13:39,634 --> 00:13:41,000
No. there's no hits
on her profile.

319
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:42,200
And it is a her,
by the way.

320
00:13:42,267 --> 00:13:44,734
This unsub could still
be selling babies,

321
00:13:44,801 --> 00:13:46,400
Just not through the system.

322
00:13:46,467 --> 00:13:47,634
That's gonna make him
a lot harder to catch.

323
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:49,367
Hotch:
all right. it's late.

324
00:13:49,434 --> 00:13:52,234
Let's get some rest.
we'll hit this fresh
in the morning.

325
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,968
Garcia out.

326
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,567
Morgan.

327
00:13:58,834 --> 00:14:01,734
I'd like for you to write up
a preliminary profile.

328
00:14:02,934 --> 00:14:04,067
We don't have enough
for that.

329
00:14:04,133 --> 00:14:05,567
Well, that's why
it's preliminary.

330
00:14:05,634 --> 00:14:08,734
A work in progress profile helps
show us what we're missing.

331
00:14:08,801 --> 00:14:10,200
Ok.

332
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:12,133
Sure.

333
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,901
How you holding up?

334
00:14:18,968 --> 00:14:20,734
We just wasted a day
looking into a black market

335
00:14:20,801 --> 00:14:22,234
That probably doesn't exist.

336
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,300
That's not what i mean.

337
00:14:23,367 --> 00:14:24,567
I've heard whispers.

338
00:14:24,634 --> 00:14:26,334
You're getting some heat.

339
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:29,667
I'm taking care of it.

340
00:14:32,901 --> 00:14:36,734
So, you, uh, think we have
a tunnel vision problem?

341
00:14:36,801 --> 00:14:38,234
I think
we'd like to believe

342
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,501
That we could
save those kids,

343
00:14:39,567 --> 00:14:41,000
But look what he does
to the mothers.

344
00:14:41,067 --> 00:14:42,234
A lot of anger.

345
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,501
He's probably doing the same
thing to the children.

346
00:14:44,567 --> 00:14:46,801
His own children.

347
00:14:46,868 --> 00:14:49,901
Maybe.

348
00:14:49,968 --> 00:14:52,467
Garcia said something
interesting.

349
00:14:52,534 --> 00:14:54,601
Blond-haired, blue-eyed
babies get top dollar

350
00:14:54,667 --> 00:14:57,100
In the adoption system.

351
00:14:57,167 --> 00:14:59,767
All the mothers...

352
00:14:59,834 --> 00:15:02,434
Have blond hair
and blue eyes.

353
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:04,133
You're gonna love this.

354
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,300
This guy,
he has like the best.

355
00:15:07,367 --> 00:15:09,133
Like there is no better.

356
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,234
He has like
this access to god.

357
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,801
He doesn't want
to hang on to it.

358
00:15:12,868 --> 00:15:14,567
He wants to give it away.

359
00:15:14,634 --> 00:15:15,801
How much further?

360
00:15:15,868 --> 00:15:17,267
Not much.

361
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:19,701
Because that's what
god's love is,
you know, it's sharing.

362
00:15:19,767 --> 00:15:22,133
It's giving everything
you have of yourself away

363
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,934
And not expecting
anything in return.

364
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,968
Where are we?

365
00:15:26,033 --> 00:15:27,334
Right here, baby,

366
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,701
Right where
we need to be.

367
00:15:30,901 --> 00:15:32,501
Aah!

368
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,801
Aah! aah!

369
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:43,834
[groans]

370
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,567
She's good, right?

371
00:15:45,634 --> 00:15:47,501
That's the kind
of chick you want?

372
00:15:47,567 --> 00:15:49,200
[woman gasping]

373
00:15:49,267 --> 00:15:51,167
She's perfect.

374
00:15:53,467 --> 00:15:55,067
I know it's a long shot,
but monica's parents

375
00:15:55,133 --> 00:15:56,567
Said that she was heading west.

376
00:15:56,634 --> 00:15:58,634
Maybe she made it
part of the way
when she was kidnapped.

377
00:15:58,701 --> 00:16:01,501
So why not run her dna
against adoption records
in surrounding states?

378
00:16:01,567 --> 00:16:04,067
Are you kidding?
i think you're brilliant.

379
00:16:04,133 --> 00:16:06,734
Hey, jj, if we find
this little girl,

380
00:16:06,801 --> 00:16:08,234
What's gonna happen to her?

381
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,734
If something illegal
transpires

382
00:16:09,801 --> 00:16:11,834
During the adoption process,
the court nullifies it,

383
00:16:11,901 --> 00:16:14,801
The child gets returned
to the closest
blood relative.

384
00:16:14,868 --> 00:16:16,067
Huh.

385
00:16:16,133 --> 00:16:17,601
If it helps,

386
00:16:17,667 --> 00:16:19,567
I have met with
the grandparents.

387
00:16:19,634 --> 00:16:21,000
They're
wonderful people.

388
00:16:21,067 --> 00:16:22,868
Oh, i'm sure they are.

389
00:16:22,934 --> 00:16:25,400
It's just...

390
00:16:25,467 --> 00:16:27,601
I don't know, i...

391
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:29,033
I lost my parents.

392
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,100
Granted, i was older
than she is, but...

393
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:35,801
What got me through
were the people
closest to me, and...

394
00:16:35,868 --> 00:16:39,267
If monica's daughter
is with a good family

395
00:16:39,334 --> 00:16:42,167
And we take her away
from them...

396
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:44,767
Are we doing
more harm than good?

397
00:16:44,834 --> 00:16:46,033
Yeah.

398
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,534
Garcia, i don't think
we have a choice.

399
00:16:48,601 --> 00:16:51,467
These people have a right
to their granddaughter.

400
00:16:51,534 --> 00:16:53,000
You're right.

401
00:16:53,067 --> 00:16:54,033
Yeah.

402
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,701
This sucks.

403
00:16:55,767 --> 00:16:57,734
Yes, right away, please.

404
00:16:57,801 --> 00:16:59,634
Thank you.

405
00:16:59,701 --> 00:17:03,067
Hey. i just called cps,
asked them to send over
infant mortality files.

406
00:17:03,133 --> 00:17:04,634
Another group
for us to eliminate.

407
00:17:04,701 --> 00:17:06,067
Good.
what's that?

408
00:17:06,133 --> 00:17:08,868
Your profile. i disagree
with your analysis.

409
00:17:08,934 --> 00:17:09,968
Hotch, are you serious?

410
00:17:10,033 --> 00:17:11,501
<i>it's not a law review
article,</i>

411
00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:13,067
It's just something
for us to brainstorm.

412
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:14,501
But you only focused
on one angle, morgan,

413
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:16,734
That the prenatal drugs
indicate the presence

414
00:17:16,801 --> 00:17:18,801
Of a wife or a girlfriend.
we need more options.

415
00:17:18,868 --> 00:17:21,501
Which i can give you
once we make the proper
deductions.

416
00:17:21,567 --> 00:17:23,968
Hotch, you're asking me
to guess.

417
00:17:24,033 --> 00:17:26,067
Morgan, in order for
the profile to be useful,

418
00:17:26,133 --> 00:17:27,567
It has to generate
multiple scenarios

419
00:17:27,634 --> 00:17:28,801
About what the unsub
is doing.

420
00:17:28,868 --> 00:17:29,968
Rewrite it.

421
00:17:30,033 --> 00:17:31,167
We got her.

422
00:17:31,234 --> 00:17:32,400
Monica winmar's daughter.

423
00:17:32,467 --> 00:17:33,601
She was adopted 4 years ago.

424
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:34,701
She's lisa now.

425
00:17:34,767 --> 00:17:36,200
How did garcia find her?

426
00:17:36,267 --> 00:17:37,701
She cross-referenced
the entire new mexico system.

427
00:17:37,767 --> 00:17:40,434
She wasn't in new mexico.
she was in arizona.

428
00:17:40,501 --> 00:17:43,167
So all the mothers
were abducted and dumped
in new mexico,

429
00:17:43,234 --> 00:17:45,267
But he keeps the babies
in arizona.

430
00:17:45,334 --> 00:17:47,501
Rossi: he knows the police
with stop looking
at the state line.

431
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,434
The adoption agency's
gonna be our best lead
to the unsub.

432
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:50,601
Who handled the case?

433
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:52,133
Jj: that's bombshell
number 2.

434
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,000
She didn't go through
an agency.

435
00:17:54,067 --> 00:17:55,701
She was dropped off
anonymously at a church.

436
00:17:55,767 --> 00:17:57,534
Hospitals and churches
are safe havens.

437
00:17:57,601 --> 00:17:59,868
You can drop a baby off,
no questions asked.

438
00:17:59,934 --> 00:18:01,534
Child protection services
would look for
the closest relative.

439
00:18:01,601 --> 00:18:03,467
Another search that ends
at the state line.

440
00:18:03,534 --> 00:18:06,300
And if cps doesn't
find one, the baby
will go into foster care,

441
00:18:06,367 --> 00:18:07,601
Which is what happened
to lisa.

442
00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:09,133
She was lucky.
the adoption process

443
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,234
Happened within a month.

444
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,067
So, this unsub
had the opportunity

445
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:13,501
To make money off this infant.

446
00:18:13,567 --> 00:18:15,767
He doesn't,
drops it off at a church

447
00:18:15,834 --> 00:18:18,234
Because he knows the state
will take good care of it.

448
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,534
That's awfully considerate.

449
00:18:19,601 --> 00:18:21,734
Outside the murders,
nothing about this unsub's

450
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:23,534
Behavior profiles
like a sexual sadist...

451
00:18:23,601 --> 00:18:24,834
As i wrote.

452
00:18:24,901 --> 00:18:26,033
Yeah, morgan's right.

453
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,400
It's the actions
of a caretaker,
a mother.

454
00:18:28,467 --> 00:18:30,234
Could our unsub be a woman?

455
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,834
Uh, only a man would torture
his victims this much.

456
00:18:32,901 --> 00:18:34,767
Men get off on this kind
of violence. women don't.

457
00:18:34,834 --> 00:18:37,234
Morgan: he could be married,
though, his wife being

458
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,434
A passive participant,
taking care of the moms.

459
00:18:38,501 --> 00:18:39,601
And the babies.

460
00:18:39,667 --> 00:18:41,067
All right.
we need to split up.

461
00:18:41,133 --> 00:18:42,434
We'll give the profile
to the arizona

462
00:18:42,501 --> 00:18:43,734
And the new mexico
state police.

463
00:18:43,801 --> 00:18:45,367
Rossi, reid, and prentiss,
i want you to head to phoenix.

464
00:18:45,434 --> 00:18:48,968
Morgan, you're here with me.
we'll finalize the profile.

465
00:18:50,834 --> 00:18:52,067
[groans]

466
00:18:53,434 --> 00:18:54,701
Ohh.

467
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:57,701
How are you feeling?

468
00:18:57,767 --> 00:18:59,667
Terrible.

469
00:19:00,601 --> 00:19:02,133
What are you on?

470
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,534
What?

471
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:04,968
What are you talking about?

472
00:19:05,033 --> 00:19:07,400
When he takes us,
we're all on something.

473
00:19:07,467 --> 00:19:09,067
I was an alcoholic.

474
00:19:09,133 --> 00:19:10,534
So, what are you on?

475
00:19:10,601 --> 00:19:13,334
Uh...crack.

476
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,100
I'm carol.

477
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:17,467
I'm julie.

478
00:19:17,534 --> 00:19:21,667
Here. here's some water.
come drink some.

479
00:19:26,968 --> 00:19:31,734
Um...is this some kind of
tough love detox?

480
00:19:31,801 --> 00:19:33,367
[clanking]

481
00:19:33,434 --> 00:19:35,734
Oh, what is that?

482
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:38,133
It's like the sun.

483
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,133
It gives us vitamin d.

484
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,067
It keeps us healthy.

485
00:19:42,133 --> 00:19:44,601
Well, they can't make us
stay here.

486
00:19:45,968 --> 00:19:48,267
Hey! hey, let me out!

487
00:19:48,334 --> 00:19:50,300
I want to go home!

488
00:19:50,367 --> 00:19:53,400
I want my clothes!
i want my phone!

489
00:19:53,467 --> 00:19:56,801
Let me out of here!
let me out!

490
00:19:56,868 --> 00:19:58,901
Why is he doing this?

491
00:19:58,968 --> 00:20:00,701
What does he want?

492
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,767
Your baby.

493
00:20:03,834 --> 00:20:05,400
I'm not pregnant.

494
00:20:05,467 --> 00:20:07,501
You will be.

495
00:20:07,567 --> 00:20:09,334
[door opens]

496
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,434
Morgan: the unsubs
that we are looking for
are a couple.

497
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,934
Now, the man in the relationship

498
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,901
Most likely has a history
of sexual violence.

499
00:20:14,968 --> 00:20:17,634
He started with stalking,
and then moved his way up
to assault and rape.

500
00:20:17,701 --> 00:20:19,434
And that violent streak
ended temporarily

501
00:20:19,501 --> 00:20:21,334
When he found his wife.

502
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,801
For the first years
of their marriage,

503
00:20:22,868 --> 00:20:24,300
She submitted to his torture.

504
00:20:24,367 --> 00:20:27,133
Look for wives who came
into the e.r. repeatedly

505
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,100
And with obvious signs
of spousal abuse,

506
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:31,033
But you are gonna have to
go back about 5 years.

507
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,634
That's because around the time
of the first abduction,

508
00:20:33,701 --> 00:20:34,801
The visits stopped.

509
00:20:34,868 --> 00:20:36,467
The sexual sadist
can't find satisfaction

510
00:20:36,534 --> 00:20:37,701
From a willing participant.

511
00:20:37,767 --> 00:20:39,400
He eventually got to a place
where he couldn't escalate

512
00:20:39,467 --> 00:20:41,000
His violence against her
without killing her,

513
00:20:41,067 --> 00:20:42,467
So she made him a deal.

514
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:44,367
He gets to kidnap,
rape, and kill

515
00:20:44,434 --> 00:20:45,968
Each of the runaways,

516
00:20:46,033 --> 00:20:48,133
And she gets to keep
the children.

517
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,968
She's been giving the victims
a series of prescription
prenatal drugs.

518
00:20:51,067 --> 00:20:53,934
So you're gonna want to look
at the obstetric fields, uh,

519
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,300
Nurses, o.b.s.

520
00:20:55,367 --> 00:20:56,767
The wife needs
these children.

521
00:20:56,834 --> 00:20:59,601
At first, they were
the lifeline
that kept her alive.

522
00:20:59,667 --> 00:21:02,534
As long as he had other
targets for his abuse,

523
00:21:02,601 --> 00:21:04,100
She avoided his rage.

524
00:21:04,167 --> 00:21:06,434
So if these children
protect her from abuse,

525
00:21:06,501 --> 00:21:09,033
Why is she putting them
up for adoption?

526
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,234
We believe the unsubs
want children who
resemble them physically,

527
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,934
Who no one would question
as their own.

528
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,767
All of the runaways
have been blond,

529
00:21:14,834 --> 00:21:16,767
Which means the unsub
may be as well.

530
00:21:16,834 --> 00:21:19,200
But the first child
we found in the system
was a brunette.

531
00:21:19,267 --> 00:21:20,934
Whatever the physical
characteristic--

532
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,334
The color of the eyes,
the skin type--

533
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,234
If the baby doesn't have it,

534
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,634
He or she ends up
in the foster care system,

535
00:21:27,701 --> 00:21:30,167
Wives of sexual sadists
need outlets

536
00:21:30,234 --> 00:21:32,901
As a denial mechanism
to cope with what
their partners are doing.

537
00:21:32,968 --> 00:21:35,734
And motherhood,
especially taking care
of a helpless infant,

538
00:21:35,801 --> 00:21:38,033
Is this woman's
way of coping.

539
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:41,801
Jane: you found her?

540
00:21:41,868 --> 00:21:43,834
We have.

541
00:21:43,901 --> 00:21:44,767
How is she?

542
00:21:44,834 --> 00:21:46,234
She's great.

543
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,801
She was adopted
by a young couple.

544
00:21:47,868 --> 00:21:50,601
No reports of physical
or emotional trauma.

545
00:21:50,667 --> 00:21:51,934
So when can we take her?

546
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,901
Right now we're in touch with
her adoptive parents' lawyer,

547
00:21:54,968 --> 00:21:57,434
But the law is on your side.

548
00:21:57,501 --> 00:21:59,000
Can we talk
to the parents?

549
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,734
We could discuss this
with them.

550
00:22:00,801 --> 00:22:02,868
They don't want
to initiate contact.

551
00:22:02,934 --> 00:22:06,100
They've been through
a lot right now.

552
00:22:06,167 --> 00:22:07,767
They're her parents.

553
00:22:07,834 --> 00:22:10,501
Of course they don't
want to give her up.

554
00:22:10,567 --> 00:22:14,767
Well, if she wants
to see them, then
we can work that out,

555
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:15,968
But we are her family.

556
00:22:16,033 --> 00:22:17,434
Yes, absolutely.

557
00:22:17,501 --> 00:22:19,434
No, wait.

558
00:22:19,501 --> 00:22:21,934
What are the risks here?

559
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
If we claim her,
are we hurting her?

560
00:22:25,067 --> 00:22:26,467
It's impossible to tell.

561
00:22:26,534 --> 00:22:28,434
Some kids do great.

562
00:22:28,501 --> 00:22:30,200
Others have trouble.

563
00:22:30,267 --> 00:22:31,634
But why are we
talking about risks?

564
00:22:31,701 --> 00:22:33,000
She's monica's daughter.

565
00:22:33,067 --> 00:22:33,968
Conrad...

566
00:22:34,033 --> 00:22:35,300
She's not their blood.

567
00:22:35,367 --> 00:22:37,801
Stop it.

568
00:22:39,033 --> 00:22:41,667
Thank you, agent jareau.

569
00:22:41,734 --> 00:22:45,234
But my husband and i,
we need to discuss this.

570
00:22:55,367 --> 00:22:56,834
What's this?

571
00:22:56,901 --> 00:22:58,567
It's the pattern
i've been looking for.

572
00:22:58,634 --> 00:23:00,734
The unsubs hid their
tracks with the mothers,

573
00:23:00,801 --> 00:23:03,501
But they weren't so careful
with the abandoned babies.

574
00:23:03,567 --> 00:23:04,934
Did you find
more children?

575
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,934
Dna-wise, no,
but deductively, yes.

576
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,367
I gathered all the records
for all infants
who entered into foster care

577
00:23:09,434 --> 00:23:11,934
In a 2-week window
following each mother's death.

578
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,767
Then i narrowed it down
to babies that were
abandoned at churches.

579
00:23:14,834 --> 00:23:16,501
This is where
the guesswork begins.

580
00:23:16,567 --> 00:23:19,334
Monica's winmar's daughter
was abandoned at
a presbyterian church.

581
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,601
Let's assume the unsub,
or the wife at least,
is presbyterian.

582
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:23,934
That means all other
unwanted children

583
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,901
Are gonna be left at
the same denomination, right?

584
00:23:25,968 --> 00:23:28,601
That narrows it down
to 3 babies

585
00:23:28,667 --> 00:23:31,267
Left at 3 different
presbyterian churches

586
00:23:31,334 --> 00:23:33,567
All within this 20-mile radius.

587
00:23:33,634 --> 00:23:36,267
This is where they live.

588
00:23:36,334 --> 00:23:39,033
These kids
you deduced to--

589
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,400
Have you looked
at their files?

590
00:23:41,467 --> 00:23:43,400
No. right now i've only
been tracking churches. why?

591
00:23:43,467 --> 00:23:45,400
Because you just uncovered
another pattern.

592
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:46,567
Yeah,
we're packing up now.

593
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:48,434
We can be in phoenix
in about 2 hours.

594
00:23:48,501 --> 00:23:49,734
You sure about this?

595
00:23:49,801 --> 00:23:52,067
The names of the babies
reid found tells us everything.

596
00:23:52,133 --> 00:23:54,467
Lisa, elizabeth, amanda.

597
00:23:54,534 --> 00:23:56,067
We profiled there'd
be a type they'd keep

598
00:23:56,133 --> 00:23:57,567
And a type they'd put
into foster care.

599
00:23:57,634 --> 00:23:59,367
They're keeping the boys.

600
00:24:01,133 --> 00:24:04,300
[heartbeat]

601
00:24:14,868 --> 00:24:16,501
It's time.

602
00:24:22,267 --> 00:24:23,833
Julie: what are you doing?

603
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,201
What are you doing?!

604
00:24:25,267 --> 00:24:27,534
Hey, where are you going?
come back!

605
00:24:27,601 --> 00:24:31,034
You have to come back!
please!

606
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,134
They never stay
for this part.

607
00:24:33,201 --> 00:24:35,167
No, no, no, no.
you're not actually--

608
00:24:35,234 --> 00:24:38,934
Yes...i am.

609
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,434
They've induced.

610
00:24:40,501 --> 00:24:42,733
What am i supposed to do?

611
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,367
You help me.

612
00:24:45,434 --> 00:24:46,833
1-1,000...

613
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,267
Ohh!

614
00:24:48,334 --> 00:24:49,134
2-1,000...

615
00:24:49,201 --> 00:24:50,700
No, no, no, i'm sorry,
i can't.

616
00:24:50,767 --> 00:24:51,967
3-1,000...
i can't help you.

617
00:24:52,034 --> 00:24:53,367
I can't. i'm sick.

618
00:24:53,434 --> 00:24:55,767
I'm not well.
i need a...

619
00:24:55,833 --> 00:24:57,634
I can't do it.
julie, listen to me.

620
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,100
Are you listening to me?

621
00:24:59,167 --> 00:25:00,501
Yes. yes.

622
00:25:00,568 --> 00:25:03,501
If this baby
doesn't make it...

623
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:05,034
They are going
to kill me.

624
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,568
And once they've
killed me,

625
00:25:07,634 --> 00:25:10,301
They are going
to move on to you.

626
00:25:10,367 --> 00:25:12,668
Do you understand?

627
00:25:12,733 --> 00:25:13,967
Ok.

628
00:25:14,034 --> 00:25:16,934
Ok. what do we do?

629
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,167
Jj, i need you to call
these fertility specialists

630
00:25:20,234 --> 00:25:22,434
And get them over here
for interviews.

631
00:25:22,501 --> 00:25:24,100
Whoa.
yeah, i know.

632
00:25:24,167 --> 00:25:25,668
Hotch wants to focus
on the prenatal drugs

633
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:27,401
The unsubs are giving
the victims.

634
00:25:27,467 --> 00:25:29,034
He thinks we can build
a new suspect pool,

635
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,501
And he wants it done
yesterday.

636
00:25:30,568 --> 00:25:33,067
There's 2 pages of names here.
shouldn't we narrow it down?

637
00:25:33,134 --> 00:25:34,767
Jj, just do it, ok?

638
00:25:37,367 --> 00:25:38,833
I'm sorry.

639
00:25:41,568 --> 00:25:44,067
Is everything ok?

640
00:25:46,534 --> 00:25:47,867
Hotch has been on me
ever since we got here,

641
00:25:47,934 --> 00:25:49,568
And for the life of me,
i can't figure out why.

642
00:25:49,634 --> 00:25:51,934
Oh, i might know.

643
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,501
The night before
hotch picked this case,

644
00:25:53,568 --> 00:25:55,833
Chief strauss
stopped by the b.a.u.

645
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,167
They were behind
closed doors,

646
00:25:58,234 --> 00:26:01,034
And it seemed like
it got a little tense.

647
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,367
Well, the bureau's
been on him for a while.

648
00:26:03,434 --> 00:26:05,067
He must have known
this was gonna happen.

649
00:26:05,134 --> 00:26:08,934
Except now they're making him
justify every decision.

650
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,401
For hotch, that's...hell.

651
00:26:11,467 --> 00:26:13,900
Rossi: dr. dekeyser,
we don't think

652
00:26:13,967 --> 00:26:15,733
She's getting these prenatal
drugs as a patient.

653
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,334
You're thinking she's writing
the scrip for these herself.

654
00:26:18,401 --> 00:26:19,434
Something like that.

655
00:26:19,501 --> 00:26:21,434
Then she wouldn't be
very knowledgeable

656
00:26:21,501 --> 00:26:22,700
About what she's doing.

657
00:26:22,767 --> 00:26:24,367
Some of these drugs
have serious side effects.

658
00:26:24,434 --> 00:26:26,833
There's dozens of meds
i would prescribe before these,

659
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,000
All of them more effective.

660
00:26:28,067 --> 00:26:29,534
So why would she use these?

661
00:26:29,601 --> 00:26:32,034
My guess--these are the ones
she had access to.

662
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,534
Fertility drugs
are a cocktail,

663
00:26:33,601 --> 00:26:36,367
And you keep
remixing the cocktail
until you get pregnant.

664
00:26:36,434 --> 00:26:38,534
The information is out there
on the internet.

665
00:26:38,601 --> 00:26:40,134
She found the right one.

666
00:26:40,201 --> 00:26:42,534
So the woman was
prescribed these drugs

667
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,134
Maybe for
some other illness

668
00:26:44,201 --> 00:26:47,000
And figured out that
they helped carry
a baby to term.

669
00:26:47,067 --> 00:26:48,301
Exactly.

670
00:26:48,367 --> 00:26:49,501
Then the real question is,

671
00:26:49,568 --> 00:26:53,201
What other diseases
do these drugs treat?

672
00:26:53,267 --> 00:26:56,201
Ok. i can do this.

673
00:26:56,267 --> 00:26:57,534
I can do this.

674
00:26:57,601 --> 00:27:00,634
[fetal heartbeat on monitor]

675
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,334
What?

676
00:27:02,401 --> 00:27:06,601
Nothing.
you remind me of me.

677
00:27:08,601 --> 00:27:10,534
Carol? hey.

678
00:27:10,601 --> 00:27:13,000
Carol, please,
please stay awake.

679
00:27:13,067 --> 00:27:14,334
Please?

680
00:27:14,401 --> 00:27:15,867
Ok, just--just focus

681
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:17,501
On the sound of my voice, ok?

682
00:27:17,568 --> 00:27:18,434
Can you do that?

683
00:27:18,501 --> 00:27:19,733
I'm here.

684
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,100
Carol, tell me
about the woman

685
00:27:22,167 --> 00:27:24,000
Who was here before me.

686
00:27:24,067 --> 00:27:26,034
What happened to her?

687
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,668
She miscarried...

688
00:27:28,733 --> 00:27:30,668
A lot.

689
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:33,568
Then she gave birth
to a girl.

690
00:27:33,634 --> 00:27:36,267
They don't like girls.

691
00:27:36,334 --> 00:27:39,668
This isn't your
first time, is it?

692
00:27:39,733 --> 00:27:42,301
No.

693
00:27:42,367 --> 00:27:44,301
What happened?

694
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,201
He didn't make it.

695
00:27:49,767 --> 00:27:52,601
I'm sorry.

696
00:27:52,668 --> 00:27:56,301
They let you live
even if you lose him.

697
00:27:58,367 --> 00:28:00,900
They want those boys.

698
00:28:00,967 --> 00:28:04,034
Ok. ok, hey. hey.

699
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,234
Listen, i don't know
what to do, ok,

700
00:28:06,301 --> 00:28:09,800
So please, please,
just tell me what to do.

701
00:28:11,367 --> 00:28:12,867
How dilated am i?

702
00:28:12,934 --> 00:28:15,668
Wh-what? i don't know
what that means.

703
00:28:15,733 --> 00:28:19,501
Just put your fingers
in a row and...

704
00:28:19,568 --> 00:28:21,934
Measure me.

705
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Wait...

706
00:28:24,067 --> 00:28:26,301
Oh, my god.

707
00:28:27,201 --> 00:28:29,767
[groaning]

708
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,767
Ok...

709
00:28:31,833 --> 00:28:33,100
Oh, my god.

710
00:28:33,167 --> 00:28:35,301
Ok. um...

711
00:28:35,367 --> 00:28:38,000
It's 4. it's 4 fingers.

712
00:28:38,067 --> 00:28:39,833
And i--oh, god,
is that the head?

713
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,900
Mm-hmm.

714
00:28:40,967 --> 00:28:43,733
Oh, my god,
what does that mean?

715
00:28:46,167 --> 00:28:47,301
It means...

716
00:28:47,367 --> 00:28:50,067
It's time to push.

717
00:28:54,167 --> 00:28:55,867
What is this?

718
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:57,067
It's a tactical
arrest plan.

719
00:28:57,134 --> 00:28:58,800
I'd like you to write
it up for this case.

720
00:28:58,867 --> 00:29:00,634
You want me to write up
how we apprehend these unsubs

721
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,634
Without risking the lives
of the children.

722
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,568
Yes.

723
00:29:04,634 --> 00:29:06,733
[scoffs] hotch, i've led
dozens of tactical assaults.

724
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,867
You've never made me
write up one of these before.

725
00:29:08,934 --> 00:29:11,467
That's because
i always do it for you
after each case.

726
00:29:11,534 --> 00:29:12,967
[scoffs]

727
00:29:13,034 --> 00:29:14,401
You know what?

728
00:29:14,467 --> 00:29:16,833
I'm sorry strauss
is coming down on you.

729
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,134
This is not about strauss.

730
00:29:18,201 --> 00:29:20,534
Really? i disagree.

731
00:29:20,601 --> 00:29:22,434
Look, i understand
that you're under the gun.

732
00:29:22,501 --> 00:29:25,234
But i gotta say it.
i'm really not
all that surprised.

733
00:29:25,301 --> 00:29:29,000
I've watched you walk away
from a bunch of cops
gunning down unsubs in d.c.

734
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:32,267
You walked in unprotected
to a hostage situation
in louisville.

735
00:29:32,334 --> 00:29:34,401
Of course the bureau's
worried about you.

736
00:29:34,467 --> 00:29:36,201
Man, i'm worried about you.

737
00:29:36,267 --> 00:29:38,867
But just because
you're the one who's
under the magnifying glass,

738
00:29:38,934 --> 00:29:40,501
That doesn't mean
i can't domyjob.

739
00:29:40,568 --> 00:29:43,800
Morgan, there's
a big part of your job
that i do for you

740
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:46,000
Because i don't need you
worried about paperwork
and politics.

741
00:29:46,067 --> 00:29:48,267
I need you in the field
and focused and catching
the next unsub.

742
00:29:48,334 --> 00:29:50,100
But i can't do that anymore.

743
00:29:50,167 --> 00:29:52,000
I don't have to justify
my orders to you,

744
00:29:52,067 --> 00:29:53,934
And you do have to
follow them.

745
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,867
I've always
followed your orders
when they made sense.

746
00:29:56,934 --> 00:30:00,434
Well, if you have a problem
with this one, tell me now.

747
00:30:00,501 --> 00:30:02,634
You're the boss.

748
00:30:04,267 --> 00:30:06,100
Garcia needs to talk
to us asap.

749
00:30:06,167 --> 00:30:08,534
Ok, so the gold star
of the day goes to
agent david rossi

750
00:30:08,601 --> 00:30:10,367
And his short list
of one disease

751
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:12,267
These prenatal drugs
also treat.

752
00:30:12,334 --> 00:30:15,100
Breast cancer.
progesterone, tamoxifen
slow the spread,

753
00:30:15,167 --> 00:30:16,267
Metoclopramide
and domperidone--

754
00:30:16,334 --> 00:30:19,000
Are for anti-nausea
if i remember correctly.

755
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,634
If this woman has breast
cancer, would she be able
to get pregnant?

756
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,733
She could.
she'd have to be dedicated.

757
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,800
How dedicated?

758
00:30:24,867 --> 00:30:26,301
Well, she'd have to
go off chemotherapy.

759
00:30:26,367 --> 00:30:27,467
She'd be in a lot of pain.

760
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:28,800
But she'll try anyway.

761
00:30:28,867 --> 00:30:30,733
Her whole life is children.
that's her goal.

762
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,501
The first runaway,
monica winmar,

763
00:30:32,568 --> 00:30:33,700
When was she abducted?

764
00:30:33,767 --> 00:30:34,767
Garcia: 5 years ago.

765
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,267
How many breast cancer
patients in arizona

766
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,134
Got pregnant
5 to 6 years ago?

767
00:30:38,201 --> 00:30:39,800
Uh, let me see.

768
00:30:39,867 --> 00:30:41,234
Not a lot. 7.

769
00:30:41,301 --> 00:30:43,501
How many of those patients
are married to a man

770
00:30:43,568 --> 00:30:46,067
With a history
of sexual violence?

771
00:30:46,134 --> 00:30:47,967
Just one--
robert and linda reimann.

772
00:30:48,034 --> 00:30:49,800
Oh, jeez.
what?

773
00:30:49,867 --> 00:30:51,201
She lost the baby
in month 8.

774
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:53,000
She had to go through
labor anyway.

775
00:30:53,067 --> 00:30:55,134
Well, that kind of physical
and emotional trauma,
there's our stressor.

776
00:30:55,201 --> 00:30:57,000
Garcia,
was the baby a boy?

777
00:30:57,067 --> 00:31:00,100
Yeah. they even
named him--michael.

778
00:31:00,167 --> 00:31:01,800
There has to be a name
on the death certificate.

779
00:31:01,867 --> 00:31:05,234
Doctors encourage bonding
between mothers and stillborns.

780
00:31:05,301 --> 00:31:07,867
I...volunteer with
a new mom counseling group.

781
00:31:07,934 --> 00:31:09,467
They say it helps them
cope with feelings of loss.

782
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:13,267
Well, this unsub can't cope,
so she's recreating them.

783
00:31:13,334 --> 00:31:16,267
Ok, come on,
you're almost there.
just push.

784
00:31:16,334 --> 00:31:17,367
Push!

785
00:31:17,434 --> 00:31:19,668
[grunting]

786
00:31:19,733 --> 00:31:22,334
[baby crying]
oh, my god.

787
00:31:23,267 --> 00:31:25,234
Is it a boy or a girl?

788
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:27,067
Ha! it's a boy.

789
00:31:27,134 --> 00:31:28,568
[baby crying]

790
00:31:28,634 --> 00:31:31,733
Oh...

791
00:31:34,234 --> 00:31:35,800
[crying]

792
00:31:35,867 --> 00:31:38,568
You're here.

793
00:31:38,634 --> 00:31:40,900
You made it.

794
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,100
[grunting]

795
00:31:46,167 --> 00:31:47,934
[door opens]

796
00:31:50,067 --> 00:31:51,501
No.

797
00:31:53,668 --> 00:31:55,334
Don't.

798
00:31:55,401 --> 00:31:58,100
No! no, please,
leave her alone.
please!

799
00:31:58,167 --> 00:32:00,668
Please, please, please,
just wait one minute.

800
00:32:00,733 --> 00:32:02,501
Please, please!

801
00:32:02,568 --> 00:32:04,568
[baby crying]

802
00:32:11,867 --> 00:32:13,867
It's a boy.

803
00:32:13,934 --> 00:32:16,267
[crying]

804
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,800
Michael.

805
00:32:27,301 --> 00:32:29,301
Ok, commander, this here

806
00:32:29,367 --> 00:32:30,867
Is the unsub's address.

807
00:32:30,934 --> 00:32:32,700
Now, 5 years ago
when the wife lost their child,

808
00:32:32,767 --> 00:32:34,167
The husband started paying

809
00:32:34,234 --> 00:32:36,067
For home renovations
with his credit card.

810
00:32:36,134 --> 00:32:38,201
Shower, toilet, tile,
and mesh fencing

811
00:32:38,267 --> 00:32:39,634
Which he did not put up
in his backyard.

812
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,700
He was building
his dungeon.

813
00:32:41,767 --> 00:32:43,668
No permits were filed
for additional building
on the property,

814
00:32:43,733 --> 00:32:45,301
So the entrance
must be inside the house.

815
00:32:45,367 --> 00:32:46,767
How many doors
are there to cover?

816
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:48,867
There's 2--one in the front,
one in the back.

817
00:32:48,934 --> 00:32:50,501
We have the arrest warrants?

818
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:51,434
Faxed over
20 minutes ago.

819
00:32:51,501 --> 00:32:52,668
Morgan, what's your plan?

820
00:32:52,733 --> 00:32:55,201
I think we should do
a soft entry.

821
00:32:55,267 --> 00:32:56,301
See if we can get
the kids out

822
00:32:56,367 --> 00:32:57,767
Before the parents
even know what's happening.

823
00:32:57,833 --> 00:32:59,167
You'd be in the door first?

824
00:32:59,234 --> 00:33:01,668
Do you have another idea?

825
00:33:01,733 --> 00:33:03,900
Send prentiss and jj
in first.

826
00:33:03,967 --> 00:33:06,934
Children are more likely
to trust a woman,
and we need that presence.

827
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,401
We don't know how many kids
are in the house.

828
00:33:09,467 --> 00:33:11,401
I mean, the parents
could take a hostage.

829
00:33:11,467 --> 00:33:12,700
But if we go in hot,

830
00:33:12,767 --> 00:33:15,000
That would
definitely happen.

831
00:33:15,067 --> 00:33:16,334
Hotch is right.

832
00:33:16,401 --> 00:33:17,967
This is the way.

833
00:34:21,234 --> 00:34:22,234
Hi.

834
00:34:22,301 --> 00:34:23,900
It's ok.

835
00:34:23,967 --> 00:34:25,234
It's ok.
we're the police.

836
00:34:25,301 --> 00:34:26,833
We're the good guys.

837
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,833
Can you come outside
with me?

838
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,434
Ok. ok.

839
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,467
Hotch, we've got one boy
accounted for.

840
00:34:36,534 --> 00:34:37,833
He's on his way out
to you,

841
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,833
But there could still
be more in the basement.

842
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,900
[toilet flushes]

843
00:34:56,534 --> 00:34:57,700
Fbi.

844
00:34:57,767 --> 00:35:00,000
Where's your wife?

845
00:35:00,067 --> 00:35:02,267
In the nursery.

846
00:35:02,334 --> 00:35:04,067
Rossi.

847
00:35:06,733 --> 00:35:07,833
Hotch.

848
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,401
Go.

849
00:35:19,234 --> 00:35:22,634
I knew this would end.

850
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,067
I always knew
you'd come to our door

851
00:35:25,134 --> 00:35:26,967
And take this away.

852
00:35:33,634 --> 00:35:36,767
Ma'am, why don't you
give me the baby.

853
00:35:36,833 --> 00:35:38,900
We can talk about it.

854
00:35:38,967 --> 00:35:41,568
Why would i want
to do that?

855
00:35:43,301 --> 00:35:45,334
What you've been doing
is wrong.

856
00:35:45,401 --> 00:35:47,367
You must know that.

857
00:35:52,634 --> 00:35:54,934
Oh, god, please, please
get us out of here!

858
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,900
Oh! oh, thank god.
thank god.

859
00:35:58,967 --> 00:36:00,367
[gasping]

860
00:36:00,434 --> 00:36:02,668
We're all clear here.

861
00:36:02,733 --> 00:36:04,234
Ohh!

862
00:36:04,301 --> 00:36:06,900
It's ok. it's ok, you're safe.
come with me.

863
00:36:06,967 --> 00:36:08,634
But no, i can't leave her.

864
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,767
All secure,
but we need medical.

865
00:36:10,833 --> 00:36:13,334
This is all i have left.

866
00:36:13,401 --> 00:36:15,700
Do you understand?

867
00:36:15,767 --> 00:36:18,201
My husband hates me.

868
00:36:18,267 --> 00:36:21,534
There's nobody here
that can help me with him,

869
00:36:21,601 --> 00:36:24,434
With this,
with any of it.

870
00:36:24,501 --> 00:36:26,568
He's all i have.

871
00:36:26,634 --> 00:36:28,234
[sniffles]

872
00:36:32,334 --> 00:36:34,234
Linda.

873
00:36:34,301 --> 00:36:36,000
Please.

874
00:36:36,067 --> 00:36:39,034
I need you to think about
the baby right now.

875
00:36:40,301 --> 00:36:43,967
You're suffering from
stage 4 breast cancer.

876
00:36:44,034 --> 00:36:45,634
You've given your medication
to the women

877
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:48,367
That have been locked up
downstairs.

878
00:36:48,434 --> 00:36:51,467
You don't have
a lot of time left.

879
00:36:51,534 --> 00:36:55,800
I know you want somebody
who will always remember
you, don't you?

880
00:36:55,867 --> 00:36:59,334
The baby's name
is michael, right?

881
00:36:59,401 --> 00:37:01,601
Yeah.

882
00:37:01,668 --> 00:37:04,534
Michael will remember you.

883
00:37:04,601 --> 00:37:07,234
He's gonna know
that you helped bring
him into the world.

884
00:37:07,301 --> 00:37:09,100
That's a part of him now.

885
00:37:09,167 --> 00:37:10,733
And he will always
ask about you,

886
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,167
Long after you're gone.

887
00:37:13,234 --> 00:37:15,267
Do you really
believe that?

888
00:37:15,334 --> 00:37:17,167
I do.

889
00:37:17,234 --> 00:37:19,401
[sniffles]

890
00:37:20,767 --> 00:37:24,201
I would have been
a wonderful mother.

891
00:37:25,867 --> 00:37:28,167
Then prove it.

892
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,134
Let him go.

893
00:37:32,201 --> 00:37:34,434
[sniffles]

894
00:37:51,534 --> 00:37:52,967
Where's my son?

895
00:37:53,034 --> 00:37:54,267
We're looking for him.

896
00:37:54,334 --> 00:37:56,800
Please, don't let
anything happen to him.

897
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,201
Look, he's here.

898
00:37:59,267 --> 00:38:00,867
He's fine.

899
00:38:06,234 --> 00:38:07,534
[crying]

900
00:38:07,601 --> 00:38:09,067
He's ok.

901
00:38:12,934 --> 00:38:14,967
Ohh...

902
00:38:15,034 --> 00:38:18,467
You are beautiful,
aren't you?

903
00:38:18,534 --> 00:38:22,201
* it took 40 days
and 40 nights *

904
00:38:22,267 --> 00:38:26,100
* to get myself
feeling right... *

905
00:38:26,167 --> 00:38:29,067
I spoke with lisa's
adoptive parents.

906
00:38:29,134 --> 00:38:30,767
They've agreed
to talk to you.

907
00:38:30,833 --> 00:38:32,668
They're not willing
to give up custody,

908
00:38:32,733 --> 00:38:36,501
But they do want
lisa to know
her grandparents.

909
00:38:36,568 --> 00:38:38,800
Yeah, we--
we can live with that.

910
00:38:38,867 --> 00:38:42,601
The reason why
i wanted you to come by

911
00:38:42,668 --> 00:38:46,234
Was...a year before
giving birth to lisa,

912
00:38:46,301 --> 00:38:48,000
Monica had a son.

913
00:38:48,067 --> 00:38:51,201
We've already matched
his dna to your daughter.

914
00:38:51,267 --> 00:38:54,501
The closest relative
should take custody.

915
00:38:55,934 --> 00:38:59,201
Would you like
to meet him?

916
00:38:59,267 --> 00:39:01,100
[jane crying]

917
00:39:01,167 --> 00:39:05,534
* there are no words
to describe... *

918
00:39:05,601 --> 00:39:07,301
What's his name?

919
00:39:07,367 --> 00:39:09,034
Michael.

920
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,167
Michael.

921
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:33,401
* no, there are no words
to describe *

922
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:39,967
* such a beautiful thing *

923
00:39:47,767 --> 00:39:50,501
Have a seat.

924
00:40:01,367 --> 00:40:03,134
The bureau thinks
that my ability

925
00:40:03,201 --> 00:40:05,700
To lead this team
has been compromised.

926
00:40:05,767 --> 00:40:07,568
What do you think?

927
00:40:09,601 --> 00:40:11,634
Sometimes i question you,
hotch.

928
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:15,467
But at the end of the day,
i do respect you.

929
00:40:15,534 --> 00:40:17,034
You're the leader
of this team,

930
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,867
And my job
is to have your back.

931
00:40:19,934 --> 00:40:22,700
Well, that's not important
to the bureau.

932
00:40:22,767 --> 00:40:25,900
They've been questioning me
since foyet's attack.

933
00:40:25,967 --> 00:40:27,634
And they're not
entirely wrong.

934
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,100
I've tried to do my best,

935
00:40:29,167 --> 00:40:32,700
But what matters now
is if strauss replaces me,

936
00:40:32,767 --> 00:40:35,134
This whole unit
will come under scrutiny.

937
00:40:35,201 --> 00:40:36,733
Members will be reassigned,
budgets will be cut.

938
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,634
Come on, hotch,
nobody's gonna replace you.

939
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,334
Fight strauss.
i'll go to the mat for you.

940
00:40:40,401 --> 00:40:41,568
So will everybody else.
you know that.

941
00:40:41,634 --> 00:40:43,067
Morgan, it won't work.

942
00:40:43,134 --> 00:40:45,334
Decisions like this have
their own momentum...

943
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:46,800
Unless i step down.

944
00:40:46,867 --> 00:40:49,334
Step down?
what are you talking about?

945
00:40:49,401 --> 00:40:52,000
I'm resigning as unit chief
at the end of the week.

946
00:40:52,067 --> 00:40:53,900
What?

947
00:40:53,967 --> 00:40:55,501
No!

948
00:40:55,568 --> 00:40:57,000
Hotch, look, yeah, ok,

949
00:40:57,067 --> 00:40:58,767
Sometimes your actions,
i may disagree with them,

950
00:40:58,833 --> 00:41:00,934
But it's not enough
for you to leave this team.

951
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,267
I'm not leaving
the team,

952
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:04,668
I'm just no longer
in charge.

953
00:41:04,733 --> 00:41:06,867
You are.

954
00:41:07,767 --> 00:41:09,601
Me?

955
00:41:09,668 --> 00:41:12,201
[laughs] look, i had the chance
to be unit chief in new york,

956
00:41:12,267 --> 00:41:13,534
And i said no.

957
00:41:13,601 --> 00:41:15,634
I turned it down
because i like this team.

958
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:18,201
Strauss can't just
fire you like this.

959
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:20,000
She can reassign me.

960
00:41:20,067 --> 00:41:23,634
And we can avoid that
if i promote internally.

961
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,634
This is wrong.

962
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:28,401
It's the only way
to keep the team together.

963
00:41:30,867 --> 00:41:34,634
[sighs] so all of this--

964
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,967
This is why you've been
pushing me so hard, huh?

965
00:41:37,034 --> 00:41:38,767
I haven't been
pushing you that hard.

966
00:41:39,767 --> 00:41:41,467
Wow.

967
00:41:41,534 --> 00:41:44,501
Morgan, i need to know

968
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:46,434
Right now--

969
00:41:46,501 --> 00:41:48,134
Will you do this?

970
00:41:51,401 --> 00:41:52,767
This would be temporary.

971
00:41:52,833 --> 00:41:55,201
Once we catch foyet,

972
00:41:55,267 --> 00:41:57,833
All this goes back
to normal.

973
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,934
Let's get started.

974
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:09,267
What's all this?

975
00:42:09,334 --> 00:42:11,501
This is the job,

976
00:42:11,568 --> 00:42:14,700
Unless you have
other plans.

977
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,334
Not tonight.
