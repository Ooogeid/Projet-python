1
00:00:04,901 --> 00:00:06,300
Yo, hurry up!

2
00:00:06,367 --> 00:00:08,367
Don't start without me.

3
00:00:08,434 --> 00:00:09,567
Move your ass.
come on.

4
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:10,868
I'm gettin' your damn beer.

5
00:00:10,934 --> 00:00:11,868
Shut up!

6
00:00:11,934 --> 00:00:13,033
Shut up, woman.
shut up?

7
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,801
Oh, me shut up, huh?

8
00:00:14,868 --> 00:00:16,801
Shut up, everyone.

9
00:00:23,601 --> 00:00:25,400
[laughing]

10
00:00:27,767 --> 00:00:30,334
Will, is that you?

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,601
Will?

12
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:35,400
Here he comes.

13
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,601
Will?

14
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,133
Ohh!
ohh!

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,701
Ohh! ohh!

16
00:00:42,767 --> 00:00:43,934
He's down.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,200
Go on, get up.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,868
Get up.

19
00:00:48,934 --> 00:00:50,367
Don't be stupid.

20
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,467
We don't want any trouble.

21
00:00:53,534 --> 00:00:56,200
Take whatever you want.

22
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,033
[crying]

23
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:09,501
I don't care
what you want.

24
00:01:09,567 --> 00:01:11,701
There's no reason
to hurt anyone.

25
00:01:13,334 --> 00:01:15,067
Here it comes.

26
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,701
Woman: no!

27
00:01:17,767 --> 00:01:18,701
No.

28
00:01:18,767 --> 00:01:20,033
That had to hurt.

29
00:01:23,367 --> 00:01:26,968
How could you possibly...

30
00:01:27,033 --> 00:01:28,834
Know what my reasons are?

31
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,200
Our boy's trying to get up.

32
00:01:32,267 --> 00:01:35,067
Which one of them
belongs to you?

33
00:01:37,501 --> 00:01:39,434
Let me guess.

34
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:43,868
Woman: oh, please
don't hurt him! please.

35
00:01:43,934 --> 00:01:45,100
It could be her.

36
00:01:45,167 --> 00:01:46,100
[man groans]

37
00:01:46,167 --> 00:01:47,367
[woman whimpering]

38
00:01:49,434 --> 00:01:52,100
Kiss your husband
goodbye.

39
00:01:53,667 --> 00:01:55,667
William...

40
00:02:00,133 --> 00:02:02,834
Why are you doing this?

41
00:02:02,901 --> 00:02:04,734
Why?!

42
00:02:05,567 --> 00:02:06,734
Why not?

43
00:02:10,234 --> 00:02:12,734
Ooh!

44
00:02:12,801 --> 00:02:14,267
Did you get that?

45
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,267
I got it, baby.

46
00:02:17,767 --> 00:02:20,534
Uh-huh. and how many dead?

47
00:02:21,634 --> 00:02:25,367
Ok. yeah, we'll be there
as soon as we can.

48
00:02:25,434 --> 00:02:26,701
Thanks.

49
00:02:26,767 --> 00:02:28,133
Well, i gotta go.

50
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,667
Let me guess.
don't get comfortable.

51
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,033
We've got 4 dead
in a home invasion.

52
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,601
Where we headed?

53
00:02:33,667 --> 00:02:34,868
It's local.
southeast d.c.

54
00:02:34,934 --> 00:02:36,334
What was
the cause of death?

55
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,701
Jj: blunt force trauma.
no knife, no gun.

56
00:02:37,767 --> 00:02:39,734
Have we been invited in?

57
00:02:39,801 --> 00:02:41,534
Yeah. cops want us to meet them
at the crime scene.

58
00:02:41,601 --> 00:02:44,033
Isn't southeast where
all that vandalism's
been lately?

59
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,868
Same area, yeah.
think they could be connected?

60
00:02:46,934 --> 00:02:49,200
I don't know.
i mean, the weapon
doesn't exactly fit

61
00:02:49,267 --> 00:02:51,400
The typical m.o.
of a home invasion
killer.

62
00:02:51,467 --> 00:02:52,667
Well,
it's worth considering.

63
00:02:52,734 --> 00:02:54,467
It's common for vandalism
to escalate into violence.

64
00:02:54,534 --> 00:02:55,834
Plus there's a lot
of anger out there.

65
00:02:55,901 --> 00:02:57,968
That neighborhood's
mostly black working class.

66
00:02:58,033 --> 00:02:59,567
Yeah. now it's being
gentrified

67
00:02:59,634 --> 00:03:02,000
While the people
who live there
are having a tough time.

68
00:03:02,067 --> 00:03:03,501
Were the victims wealthy?

69
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:05,000
Yeah, it was two couples.

70
00:03:05,067 --> 00:03:07,667
The were both part of
the influx of new wealth
in the area.

71
00:03:07,734 --> 00:03:09,000
Police report a robbery?

72
00:03:09,067 --> 00:03:10,000
Nothing was taken.

73
00:03:10,067 --> 00:03:11,634
What race
were the victims?

74
00:03:11,701 --> 00:03:13,467
One couple was white,
the other black.

75
00:03:13,534 --> 00:03:15,033
Not racially motivated.

76
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,767
Jj, find rossi and reid,
tell them we leave in 5.

77
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:20,567
Well, if this is related
to vandalism,

78
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:21,901
4 dead is a hell of
an escalation.

79
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:24,634
So there's the potential
for a lot more bodies
out there?

80
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:26,534
That's what i'm afraid of.

"there is no lasting hope

84
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:24,067
Only temporary relief

86
00:04:32,334 --> 00:04:33,834
Detective andrews?

87
00:04:33,901 --> 00:04:36,567
Hi. jennifer jareau.

88
00:04:36,634 --> 00:04:39,100
These are agents rossi,
morgan,

89
00:04:39,167 --> 00:04:41,234
Hotchner, prentiss,
and dr. reid.

90
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,934
Thanks for getting here
so fast.

91
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,267
What can you tell us?

92
00:04:44,334 --> 00:04:45,934
Looks like one of the victims
was attacked

93
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,434
When he got out of his car.

94
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:49,267
Meaning whoever did this
probably used his keys

95
00:04:49,334 --> 00:04:51,434
To get inside
and surprise the other victims.

96
00:04:51,501 --> 00:04:52,934
Who found the bodies?

97
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,367
The cleaning woman.

98
00:04:54,434 --> 00:04:55,868
She's giving her statement now.

99
00:04:55,934 --> 00:04:57,501
Dave, would you, morgan,
and prentiss go inside.

100
00:04:57,567 --> 00:04:58,968
We'll cover out here.

101
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:00,300
I know you're all
used to this,

102
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:03,801
But, uh, it's a hell
of a sight in there.

103
00:05:38,801 --> 00:05:41,567
Whoever did this
ain't human.

104
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,100
The neighbors
see anything?

105
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:49,601
Oh, you know,
the patrol cars

106
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:50,934
Are even doubled
in this area

107
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,767
Because of the vandalism--
nothing.

108
00:05:52,834 --> 00:05:56,300
The unsub would have
to be extremely fast
and efficient.

109
00:05:56,367 --> 00:05:58,801
Look at this. there's a pool
of blood here and then drops

110
00:05:58,868 --> 00:06:00,934
As the victim
moves toward the door.

111
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
How big was the victim?

112
00:06:02,067 --> 00:06:04,200
6'1", 6'2". why?

113
00:06:04,267 --> 00:06:06,467
Well, if he was strong enough
to move under his own power,

114
00:06:06,534 --> 00:06:07,968
You'd expect signs
of a struggle.

115
00:06:08,033 --> 00:06:10,634
And if not, there'd
most likely be drag marks.

116
00:06:10,701 --> 00:06:12,133
He was carried.

117
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,400
That's a lot of dead weight
for one person to move alone.

118
00:06:14,467 --> 00:06:15,834
There's no pool of blood
on the porch,

119
00:06:15,901 --> 00:06:18,467
Which means they didn't
have to set him down

120
00:06:18,534 --> 00:06:20,367
To open the door.

121
00:06:20,434 --> 00:06:23,734
Victim one
gets dropped here.

122
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:25,767
While number 2
comes around the corner

123
00:06:25,834 --> 00:06:27,701
To see what's happening,
and...

124
00:06:29,133 --> 00:06:32,400
The unsub attacks him here.

125
00:06:32,467 --> 00:06:34,234
The female victims
were probably here

126
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,334
When the first attack
occurred.

127
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,901
Which means somebody
would have to control them
pretty quickly.

128
00:06:38,968 --> 00:06:40,968
How many unsubs
are you thinking?

129
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,667
At least one
to move the body inside,

130
00:06:43,734 --> 00:06:45,868
Another one to take out
man number 2,

131
00:06:45,934 --> 00:06:48,434
And one more
to subdue the others.

132
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:52,100
Well, vandalism breeds
a pack mentality.

133
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:53,801
If it is
the same unsubs,

134
00:06:53,868 --> 00:06:56,133
We're looking at
a group of 3, maybe 4.

135
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,434
These aren't kids.

136
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:59,267
They're too efficient.

137
00:06:59,334 --> 00:07:01,167
There's a control
and precision.

138
00:07:01,234 --> 00:07:02,467
Juveniles are sloppy.

139
00:07:02,534 --> 00:07:03,667
Prentiss: he's right.

140
00:07:03,734 --> 00:07:06,234
There is nothing tentative
about these kills.

141
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,934
There's no experimentation.

142
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,133
These guys
know what they're doing.

143
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,167
I don't know.

144
00:07:12,234 --> 00:07:14,334
What are you thinking?

145
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,467
I can understand vandalism
escalating into violence,

146
00:07:16,534 --> 00:07:18,167
But that's usually gradual.

147
00:07:18,234 --> 00:07:19,968
And assault,
a single murder maybe,

148
00:07:20,067 --> 00:07:21,367
But come on, this?

149
00:07:21,434 --> 00:07:23,434
This feels fully evolved.

150
00:07:27,968 --> 00:07:29,367
September 3rd,

151
00:07:29,434 --> 00:07:32,300
15 luxury cars had
their windows smashed.

152
00:07:32,367 --> 00:07:33,734
September 14th,

153
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:36,767
A new upscale clothing
boutique was vandalized.

154
00:07:36,834 --> 00:07:38,400
September 24th,

155
00:07:38,467 --> 00:07:40,300
Two different restaurants,

156
00:07:40,367 --> 00:07:42,300
Both catering
to a wealthy clientele,

157
00:07:42,367 --> 00:07:43,934
Had their front windows smashed

158
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,767
And their interiors torn apart,
and finally, october 1st,

159
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:50,200
A newly renovated townhome

160
00:07:50,267 --> 00:07:52,434
Was ransacked before
the family could move in.

161
00:07:52,501 --> 00:07:55,067
So they went from attacking
public property

162
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:57,567
To a private residence,
but no victim.

163
00:07:57,634 --> 00:08:01,000
The question is, what makes them
move from that...to this?

164
00:08:01,067 --> 00:08:02,801
The vandalism targets
were all symbols

165
00:08:02,868 --> 00:08:04,968
Of the neighborhood's
changing makeup
and economy.

166
00:08:05,033 --> 00:08:07,033
Maybe there's something
specific about these victims

167
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,100
That set the unsubs off.

168
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:10,801
I've spoken to the victims'
family members.

169
00:08:10,868 --> 00:08:13,267
They've agreed to come in
and help however they can.

170
00:08:13,334 --> 00:08:15,000
Garcia, check
social networking sites.

171
00:08:15,067 --> 00:08:17,400
See if these unsubs
have coordinated
these attacks online.

172
00:08:17,467 --> 00:08:21,100
If they dare tweet,
i shall flush them out
like a bird dog, sir.

173
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,734
We need to be asking
how these unsubs

174
00:08:23,801 --> 00:08:25,934
Manage to not stand out
in this neighborhood.

175
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,667
Each of these crime scene
locations are a representation

176
00:08:28,734 --> 00:08:30,167
Of new wealth and status,

177
00:08:30,234 --> 00:08:32,501
But the area surrounding
the crime scenes

178
00:08:32,567 --> 00:08:34,234
Are still populated
by long-time residents

179
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,667
Who are slowly
being pushed out.

180
00:08:35,734 --> 00:08:37,467
That's a lot of
disenfranchised people

181
00:08:37,534 --> 00:08:38,934
Who are all part of
the neighborhood makeup.

182
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,534
Most likely these unsubs
don't stand out

183
00:08:40,601 --> 00:08:42,200
Because they're probably
local themselves.

184
00:08:42,267 --> 00:08:44,234
I don't know.
i'm with rossi.

185
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,501
I mean, anger i get,
but this much violence?

186
00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:49,434
We're looking at
at least 3 men

187
00:08:49,501 --> 00:08:51,901
With an incredible
amount of rage.

188
00:08:51,968 --> 00:08:53,567
Where do you hide that?

189
00:08:58,801 --> 00:09:03,767
Turner. you care to tell
the lady why it's october 14th

190
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:06,300
And she's still not ready
to move into her house?

191
00:09:06,367 --> 00:09:08,400
Not particularly.

192
00:09:08,467 --> 00:09:10,901
Man: what did you just say?

193
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,634
It's ok. really.

194
00:09:15,701 --> 00:09:16,834
No, it's not.

195
00:09:16,901 --> 00:09:18,834
Why don't you apologize
to the lady,

196
00:09:18,901 --> 00:09:20,400
Answer the question.

197
00:09:20,467 --> 00:09:21,667
My apologies, ma'am.

198
00:09:21,734 --> 00:09:24,501
Found a slight flaw
in the foundation.

199
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:27,200
Hate to think of you
home all alone at night,

200
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:28,701
Suddenly the whole place

201
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:30,734
Just collapses
underneath you.

202
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,701
Ok.

203
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:35,968
Now get back
to the drywall.

204
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,234
That's what i pay you for.

205
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,767
Let somebody else worry
about the foundation.

206
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,234
I had garcia run records
on anyone in the target area

207
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,901
Who in the last year
was foreclosed upon,
filed for bankruptcy,

208
00:10:05,968 --> 00:10:08,934
Or applied for unemployment
and then narrowed that list down

209
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,400
To men between the ages
of 25 and 45.

210
00:10:10,467 --> 00:10:11,567
And?

211
00:10:11,634 --> 00:10:13,901
713 hits.

212
00:10:14,868 --> 00:10:17,400
Victims' families are here.

213
00:10:19,067 --> 00:10:21,234
I'm very sorry
about your son.

214
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,767
We're looking to see
if there's a pattern

215
00:10:23,834 --> 00:10:26,934
Or if your son's killing
was truly random.

216
00:10:28,067 --> 00:10:31,701
So, there were no threats
that you knew of?

217
00:10:31,767 --> 00:10:33,767
No.

218
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:37,667
I understand this is
very difficult for you.

219
00:10:37,734 --> 00:10:41,167
We're just trying to
make some sense of it.

220
00:10:42,367 --> 00:10:43,968
Please.

221
00:10:47,133 --> 00:10:50,400
Morgan: ms. barnes, do you
need some more time?

222
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:56,400
Um...they said i could see
wiiam's body if i wanted to.

223
00:10:56,467 --> 00:10:59,968
I don't see what good
could come from that.

224
00:11:06,334 --> 00:11:08,400
It was just you
and your brother?

225
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:11,367
Our parents died
a few years ago.

226
00:11:11,434 --> 00:11:13,434
I'm sorry.

227
00:11:15,601 --> 00:11:18,767
I know that sounds like
something people say,

228
00:11:18,834 --> 00:11:22,100
But...i truly am sorry.

229
00:11:23,801 --> 00:11:26,834
You deal with cases
like this all the time.

230
00:11:28,501 --> 00:11:30,567
Yes, i do.

231
00:11:30,634 --> 00:11:32,300
So it's routine for you.

232
00:11:32,367 --> 00:11:35,734
There's nothing routine
about what you're
going through, ms. barnes.

233
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:40,667
Do you have brothers
and sisters?

234
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:45,300
I have two sisters.

235
00:11:45,367 --> 00:11:49,567
What would you do
if something like this
happened to one of them?

236
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:55,133
I would do everything
in my power to catch
the people who did it.

237
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,334

Is that you?
will?

242

Please, don't hurt him!

251
00:12:21,067 --> 00:12:22,067
That's pretty wicked.

252
00:12:22,133 --> 00:12:24,033
Yeah.

253
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,033

Hey, come look at this.

257
00:12:31,801 --> 00:12:33,067
What did you just say?

258
00:12:35,367 --> 00:12:36,934
What's his problem?

259
00:12:38,834 --> 00:12:41,634

to get up.

Please.

00:12:45,467 --> 00:12:48,167

Why?!

267

Why not?

Aah!

269
00:13:02,133 --> 00:13:03,334
Did you get that?

270
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,901
I got it.

You think?

274
00:14:37,067 --> 00:14:38,667
People might see.

275
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:41,534
So?

276
00:14:42,834 --> 00:14:45,534
I go first.

277
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,167
This your car?

278
00:15:19,234 --> 00:15:20,534
Yeah.

279
00:15:20,601 --> 00:15:22,367
It's nice.

Shh.

284
00:16:05,968 --> 00:16:07,434
Did anybody see anything?

285
00:16:07,501 --> 00:16:09,567
It's in the middle
of the damn parking lot.

286
00:16:09,634 --> 00:16:10,934
What about the security cam?

287
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,133
It's only on the door.

288
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,367
Who's the lady
over there?

289
00:16:13,434 --> 00:16:14,868
Manager. she discovered
the bodies

290
00:16:14,934 --> 00:16:17,300
When she came by to open up
for the breakfast crowd.

291
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:18,367
I'll go talk to her.

292
00:16:18,434 --> 00:16:19,300
Any idea
who the victims are?

293
00:16:19,367 --> 00:16:20,601
Judging by the driver's license,

294
00:16:20,667 --> 00:16:22,767
One of them's a waitress here.
it says jessica miller,

295
00:16:22,834 --> 00:16:24,934
And the other one's
probably doug taylor.

296
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,968
You can't tell for sure?

297
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:27,367
Honestly, you can't
make an i.d.

298
00:16:27,434 --> 00:16:28,801
By looking at them.

299
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,601
Hotch.

300
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:36,400
I didn't even know
what it was at first

301
00:16:36,467 --> 00:16:38,200
When i pulled up.

302
00:16:38,267 --> 00:16:40,400
They're definitely
getting bolder.

303
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:41,734
These kills
were in public.

304
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:44,734
If this is supposed to be about
symbolism, it's not anymore.

305
00:16:44,801 --> 00:16:47,334
This is a blue collar
restaurant,
the victim is a waitress.

306
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,834
There's no ideology
behind this.

307
00:16:48,901 --> 00:16:50,434
It's about violence
and power.

308
00:16:50,501 --> 00:16:52,634
They actually sat here
and drank beer
after the murders.

309
00:16:52,701 --> 00:16:54,667
They're telling us
that they don't care.

310
00:16:54,734 --> 00:16:56,267
They're like
those outlaws
that ride into town

311
00:16:56,334 --> 00:16:57,801
And let you know
the only way
to stop them

312
00:16:57,868 --> 00:16:59,033
Is by killing them.

313
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,968
If that's what they want,
i know plenty of cops

314
00:17:01,033 --> 00:17:02,267
Who'd be happy to oblige.

315
00:17:02,334 --> 00:17:03,634
Detective, we need
to keep our heads.

316
00:17:03,701 --> 00:17:04,868
Meaning what?

317
00:17:04,934 --> 00:17:06,701
Meaning that this level
of nihilism,

318
00:17:06,767 --> 00:17:08,968
This randomness,
it can have a mirror impact.

319
00:17:09,033 --> 00:17:11,267
Are you warning me
not to go after
some kind of revenge?

320
00:17:11,334 --> 00:17:13,467
All i'm saying
is this level of brutality

321
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:15,534
Is almost like a challenge
from the unsubs,

322
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,434
Trying to drag everyone
down to their level.

323
00:17:17,501 --> 00:17:19,767
And it's a natural reaction.

324
00:17:19,834 --> 00:17:22,267
I'm just doing my job.

325
00:17:26,434 --> 00:17:29,400
Let's head back.
we've got our profile.

326
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,300
[elevator dings]

327
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,133
How bad?

328
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,534
Bad bad.

329
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:41,367
You have company.

Ms. barnes.

00:18:01,567 --> 00:18:03,167
Hi.

332
00:18:03,234 --> 00:18:05,033
Sorry for just
showing up like this.

333
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,934
I heard on the news that
there were more victims

334
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,501
And i didn't know where else
to get answers.

335
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:12,701
Please.

336
00:18:16,934 --> 00:18:18,267
Thank you.

337
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:22,868
So is it true?
was it the same people
who killed william?

338
00:18:24,601 --> 00:18:25,834
Yes.

339
00:18:25,901 --> 00:18:27,567
Do you have
any suspects?

340
00:18:27,634 --> 00:18:29,801
No, but we do have a profile
of who these men might be.

341
00:18:29,868 --> 00:18:32,133
Two of our agents are giving it
to the police right now

342
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,167
And we're getting it
to all the news outlets.

343
00:18:34,234 --> 00:18:35,968
Can you explain it
to me?

344
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:37,601
Please.

345
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,667
Basically, these men are
completely disenfranchised.

346
00:18:41,734 --> 00:18:43,868
They feel like they have
nothing to live for.

347
00:18:43,934 --> 00:18:46,534
And they're looking for
anyone or anything to blame.

348
00:18:46,601 --> 00:18:48,934
Hotch: there's a lot
of anger out there.
times are tough.

349
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,467
But even so, these men
will stand out.

350
00:18:51,534 --> 00:18:53,634
They'll look to provoke
confrontation.

351
00:18:53,701 --> 00:18:55,734
Any excuse, they'll take it.

352
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,267
They don't steal
from their victims.

353
00:18:57,334 --> 00:18:58,734
They don't sexually
assault the women.

354
00:18:58,801 --> 00:19:01,400
This is about violence
for violence's sake.

355
00:19:01,467 --> 00:19:03,601
It's almost contagious.
it's twisted.

356
00:19:03,667 --> 00:19:06,000
But it's got
its own momentum.

357
00:19:06,067 --> 00:19:09,934
What we need to do
is figure out how
these men came together.

358
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,067
Rossi: we feel certain
that they have some
connection to southeast d.c.

359
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:15,467
Hotch:
they go unnoticed.

360
00:19:15,534 --> 00:19:17,734
They don't seem
out of place.

361
00:19:17,801 --> 00:19:19,200
We have no prints
from the crime scenes,

362
00:19:19,267 --> 00:19:21,467
So we believe that
the unsubs wear gloves.

363
00:19:21,534 --> 00:19:22,634
Dna testing
could take weeks,

364
00:19:22,701 --> 00:19:24,133
And we don't have
that kind of time.

365
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,033
The majority of the population
of southeast is black,

366
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,934
But if the unsubs
work in this area,

367
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,467
They could be any race.

368
00:19:31,534 --> 00:19:33,634
Hotch: because of
the physical nature
of the murders

369
00:19:33,701 --> 00:19:36,100
And the amount of control
these unsubs exert
over their victims,

370
00:19:36,167 --> 00:19:37,534
We believe that
these unsubs are large

371
00:19:37,601 --> 00:19:39,534
Or at least extremely
physically fit.

372
00:19:39,601 --> 00:19:41,367
And they have
a pack mentality.

373
00:19:41,434 --> 00:19:43,100
Canvass the local bars
and restaurants.

374
00:19:43,167 --> 00:19:45,767
See if there's a group of men
who fit this description.

375
00:19:45,834 --> 00:19:48,100
And these men
will be obsessed with
the media coverage.

376
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:50,234
Any chance
to relive their crimes.

377
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,000
So stake out
the past crime scenes.

378
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:53,901
There's a good chance
that they'll revisit them.

379
00:19:53,968 --> 00:19:56,067
They most likely come
from troubled backgrounds,

380
00:19:56,133 --> 00:19:58,567
Broken homes,
youth detention centers.

381
00:19:58,634 --> 00:20:00,434
They probably bonded
over their anger.

382
00:20:00,501 --> 00:20:02,567
And now it's like
they've become one person.

383
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:04,667
It's their whole identity.

384
00:20:04,734 --> 00:20:06,567
See, these guys,
they think of themselves

385
00:20:06,634 --> 00:20:07,901
As some type of gangsters,

386
00:20:07,968 --> 00:20:11,234
Like society's rules don't
apply to them.

387
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,767
They equate violence
with power and respect.

388
00:20:13,834 --> 00:20:17,801
And that goes for
self-respect as well.

389
00:20:21,067 --> 00:20:24,000
What could they possibly
get out of killing
innocent people

390
00:20:24,067 --> 00:20:25,334
For no reason?

391
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,167
People like this,
they're not like you and me.

392
00:20:27,234 --> 00:20:29,234
They don't feel empathy.

393
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,801
In a way, they only feel alive

394
00:20:30,868 --> 00:20:32,501
When they're creating
fear and chaos.

395
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:35,067
And your profiles, they
help catch these people?

396
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:36,868
They do.

397
00:20:38,934 --> 00:20:42,901
Thank you for helping me
through this.

398
00:20:44,834 --> 00:20:46,901
Of course.

399
00:20:58,601 --> 00:21:00,634
Detective.

400
00:21:05,634 --> 00:21:07,801
I just wanted to say
that at the crime scene

401
00:21:07,868 --> 00:21:11,000
It was not my intention
to accuse you of being
unprofessional.

402
00:21:11,067 --> 00:21:12,534
Yeah?

403
00:21:12,601 --> 00:21:14,067
It's just that
i know what it's like

404
00:21:14,133 --> 00:21:15,968
To work a case that
makes you question humanity,

405
00:21:16,033 --> 00:21:18,133
And it's not the worst thing
to remind yourself

406
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,234
To rise above it a little,
or we lose ourselves.

407
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,100
I appreciate you giving
the men the profile.

408
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:44,000
Oh, no.

409
00:21:47,701 --> 00:21:48,968
Sir, i've got something.

410
00:21:49,033 --> 00:21:50,567
I've been monitoring
social networking sites

411
00:21:50,634 --> 00:21:52,367
To see if the unsubs
communicate electronically.

412
00:21:52,434 --> 00:21:54,033
Right.
there's a text
that's blowing up.

413
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,367
I sent it to your phone.

414
00:21:55,434 --> 00:21:56,567
There's over a thousand
hits already.

415
00:21:56,634 --> 00:21:58,567
It's a plan to vandalize
cars and restaurants

416
00:21:58,634 --> 00:21:59,968
Around dupont circle.

417
00:22:00,033 --> 00:22:01,934
When does the text say
this is supposed to happen?

418
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,434
Tonight, 9:00.

419
00:22:04,501 --> 00:22:07,100
Dupont circle's not in the
unsubs' usual comfort zone.

420
00:22:07,167 --> 00:22:08,734
And it's not like these
unsubs to share control.

421
00:22:08,801 --> 00:22:10,100
[dialing cell phone]

422
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:13,167
[line ringing]

423
00:22:13,234 --> 00:22:14,934
Detective andrews,
this is agent hotchner.

424
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,434
I just sent you a text
to which we've been alerted.

425
00:22:17,501 --> 00:22:18,901
Right.

426
00:22:18,968 --> 00:22:20,801
Absolutely.
we're on our way.

427
00:22:20,868 --> 00:22:23,701
[sirens]

428
00:22:26,334 --> 00:22:28,834
Man on p.a.: you will
be arrested if you
do not disperse.

429
00:22:32,868 --> 00:22:35,601
We got wagons
at every entry point.

430
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:39,300
They're filling them up
faster than i can bring them
to holding.

431
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,601
What happened?

432
00:22:42,667 --> 00:22:44,934
My men went to make arrests,
people started resisting,

433
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,400
I called for reinforcements.

434
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:48,934
Do you know who
the instigators are?

435
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,501
There's no rhyme or reason
i can tell.

436
00:22:54,667 --> 00:22:55,934
Confiscate the cell phones.

437
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,467
When we get to the origins
of the text message,

438
00:22:57,534 --> 00:23:00,334
You'll have your ringleaders.

439
00:23:10,267 --> 00:23:13,400
They're still notifying
families and processing
most of the rioters.

440
00:23:13,467 --> 00:23:14,667
Did garcia come up
with anything?

441
00:23:14,734 --> 00:23:16,667
Yeah. she was able to isolate
the first 2 cell phones

442
00:23:16,734 --> 00:23:17,834
In the chain.

443
00:23:17,901 --> 00:23:19,567
Detective, we don't think
our unsubs are in there,

444
00:23:19,634 --> 00:23:21,300
But we'd still like to
interrogate

445
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:22,467
The possible ringleaders.

446
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:23,834
I don't think so.

447
00:23:23,901 --> 00:23:25,601
But we need to eliminate them
absolutely as suspects.

448
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:27,367
We can handle it
on our own.

449
00:23:27,434 --> 00:23:30,200
Rossi: we're not saying
you can't.

450
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,601
Is there a problem?

451
00:23:33,667 --> 00:23:36,367
You guys had my men
out there canvassing bars
looking for adults

452
00:23:36,434 --> 00:23:39,200
When i could have been doing
gang sweeps, going through
juvenile records.

453
00:23:39,267 --> 00:23:40,601
That would have been
a waste of your time.

454
00:23:40,667 --> 00:23:42,701
In case you hadn't noticed,
those are kids out there.

455
00:23:42,767 --> 00:23:44,534
We don't believe
last night's riot

456
00:23:44,601 --> 00:23:45,934
Is connected
to the murders.

457
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,100
Oh? how could it not be?

458
00:23:47,167 --> 00:23:49,067
Because the unsubs
we're looking for are older.

459
00:23:49,133 --> 00:23:51,300
They operate entirely
out of southeast d.c.

460
00:23:51,367 --> 00:23:53,300
They exercise extreme
control over their victims,

461
00:23:53,367 --> 00:23:55,334
And violence is up close
and personal.

462
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,767
None of what happened here
last night fits the profile.

463
00:23:57,834 --> 00:24:00,667
Enough with the profile.
i got probably a million
dollars worth of damage.

464
00:24:00,734 --> 00:24:02,334
I got two cops injured.

465
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,868
Which was probably
made worse
by police overreaction.

466
00:24:04,934 --> 00:24:06,467
Meaning what?

467
00:24:06,534 --> 00:24:08,467
I warned you.
cases like this,
people get too emotional.

468
00:24:08,534 --> 00:24:10,734
You're here as a guest
of my department.

469
00:24:10,801 --> 00:24:12,701
Rossi: we're only
trying to help.

470
00:24:12,767 --> 00:24:14,834
If you're so sure none of
those kids are the killers,

471
00:24:14,901 --> 00:24:16,767
Why bother
interrogating them at all?

472
00:24:16,834 --> 00:24:19,100
Because
we need to be certain.

473
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:22,000
If we're right,
if this is just some
sort of teenage dare,

474
00:24:22,067 --> 00:24:23,501
I guarantee you
that the unsubs

475
00:24:23,567 --> 00:24:25,033
Are going to respond
very quickly.

476
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,234
I appreciate your insight,

477
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,400
But we'd like to take things
from here on our own.

478
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,267
Thank you
for everything you've done.

479
00:24:32,033 --> 00:24:35,200
You're gonna want to start
with these 2 names.

480
00:24:36,868 --> 00:24:40,467
You're not helping.
i want to speak to
the officer in charge.

481
00:24:40,534 --> 00:24:41,767
Ms. barnes.

482
00:24:41,834 --> 00:24:43,934
I need someone to tell me
what's going on.

483
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,234
We're trying
to figure it out.

484
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,534
Are those the ones
who killed william?

485
00:24:47,601 --> 00:24:48,901
No, they're not.

486
00:24:48,968 --> 00:24:50,033
But they started the riot.

487
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,667
They're just a bunch
of stupid kids.

488
00:24:51,734 --> 00:24:54,467
Yeah, who vandalize
and attack people at random.

489
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:56,367
I told you these things
have their own momentum.

490
00:24:56,434 --> 00:24:57,634
Are you sure?

491
00:24:57,701 --> 00:24:59,300
I'm sorry.

492
00:24:59,367 --> 00:25:00,701
So did you all
have fun, huh?

493
00:25:00,767 --> 00:25:03,100
Do you even care
that someone died?

494
00:25:03,167 --> 00:25:04,400
Ms. barnes, you really need
to calm down.

495
00:25:04,467 --> 00:25:05,634
That's not true.
no, no one cares.

496
00:25:05,701 --> 00:25:08,200
No one cares. someone
dies and it's all

497
00:25:08,267 --> 00:25:10,601
Just a game or a job
and everyone just moves on.

498
00:25:10,667 --> 00:25:12,767
That's not true.
people do care, and i care.

499
00:25:12,834 --> 00:25:14,734
They killed my brother
for no reason!

500
00:25:14,801 --> 00:25:16,400
Please.

501
00:25:16,467 --> 00:25:19,667
Let me walk you outside
and get you some air. please.

502
00:25:19,734 --> 00:25:21,601
Walk with me.

503
00:25:21,667 --> 00:25:24,501
It's ok.

504
00:25:24,567 --> 00:25:26,434
It's all right.

505
00:25:27,601 --> 00:25:29,167
I've logged into
police dispatch

506
00:25:29,234 --> 00:25:30,567
For the area
you've isolated.

507
00:25:30,634 --> 00:25:32,300
If anything's reported,
we'll know when they know.

508
00:25:32,367 --> 00:25:33,801
Wait, are we staying
on the case?

509
00:25:33,868 --> 00:25:37,133
We all know that these
unsubs are gonna react
to last night's riot.

510
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,734
But emily's right.
they asked us to step aside.

511
00:25:39,801 --> 00:25:43,300
Andrews is a good cop.
he's just too emotional
right now.

512
00:25:43,367 --> 00:25:45,534
If we don't stay on, with
or without his permission,

513
00:25:45,601 --> 00:25:48,334
He and all the rest of us
will regret it.

514
00:25:50,267 --> 00:25:51,234
Where's morgan?

515
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,133
Uh, he's with ms. barnes.

516
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,467
Huh.

517
00:26:00,734 --> 00:26:02,567
You sure you're gonna be
all right?

518
00:26:02,634 --> 00:26:04,167
You know, i'm not crazy,
really.

519
00:26:04,234 --> 00:26:07,501
Tamara, you've been
through a trauma,

520
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:09,601
And you're
processing a lot.

521
00:26:09,667 --> 00:26:11,701
It's normal
to lose it a little.

522
00:26:12,734 --> 00:26:14,000
Thank you.

523
00:26:14,067 --> 00:26:15,267
For everything.

524
00:26:15,334 --> 00:26:16,767
I'm just doing my job.

525
00:26:16,834 --> 00:26:18,767
No, you're...

526
00:26:18,834 --> 00:26:20,868
You're a good person.

527
00:26:26,968 --> 00:26:29,534
So how's this gonna end?

528
00:26:33,334 --> 00:26:34,801
What?

529
00:26:36,901 --> 00:26:40,267
The investigation.
i mean, what happens?

530
00:26:40,334 --> 00:26:41,634
Well, if i had to guess,

531
00:26:41,701 --> 00:26:45,167
Last night's riots--
our unsubs aren't
gonna like it.

532
00:26:45,234 --> 00:26:46,767
This is their
whole identity.

533
00:26:46,834 --> 00:26:48,734
They're not gonna like
sharing the attention.

534
00:26:48,801 --> 00:26:51,167
So more people are gonna die.

535
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:53,133
They're killing
in a small area.

536
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,334
Our profile is solid.

537
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,400
Somebody
will recognize them.

538
00:26:57,467 --> 00:27:00,167
You don't think it's gonna be
that easy.

539
00:27:04,534 --> 00:27:06,734
I really need to get
back to my team.

540
00:27:06,801 --> 00:27:07,934
Yeah. i'm sorry.

541
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,434
Thank you for, uh,
driving me home.

542
00:27:10,501 --> 00:27:12,033
You're welcome.

543
00:27:24,467 --> 00:27:26,767
Agent morgan.

544
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,734
Do you think you can
get these guys?

545
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,734
We're closing in.

546
00:27:33,801 --> 00:27:36,067
And they're bound to start
feeling it.

547
00:27:36,133 --> 00:27:38,701
See, guys like this,
when they feel trapped,

548
00:27:38,767 --> 00:27:41,701
They most likely
commit suicide by cop.

549
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,567
Good.

550
00:28:15,067 --> 00:28:17,467
Where the hell do you
think you're going?

551
00:28:18,601 --> 00:28:20,234
I talked to the beat cops.

552
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,467
They're getting word out
to local businesses

553
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,200
To keep an eye out for
anyone who seems agitated

554
00:28:24,267 --> 00:28:25,767
By the news of
last night's riot.

555
00:28:25,834 --> 00:28:27,667
By now, andrews has to know

556
00:28:27,734 --> 00:28:29,601
That none of those kids
are the unsubs.

557
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:32,000
Then he's bound to beef up
police presence
in the southeast.

558
00:28:32,067 --> 00:28:33,300
We should be there, too.

559
00:28:33,367 --> 00:28:35,167
The faster we can react,
the more we can help.

560
00:28:35,234 --> 00:28:36,901
Do you think the unsubs
know about the riot?

561
00:28:36,968 --> 00:28:39,133
Front page news.
i don't know how they can't.

562
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,667
And if the profile's right?

563
00:28:40,734 --> 00:28:42,734
Their reaction's
gonna be quick and
it's gonna be brutal.

564
00:28:42,801 --> 00:28:46,334
Basically, it's like knowing
that lightning is gonna strike

565
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,934
But not being able
to pinpoint where.

566
00:29:10,801 --> 00:29:12,767
[door closes]

567
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:16,334
* the summer wind *

568
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,934
* came blowing in *

569
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,133
3 drafts.

570
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,634
* from across the sea *

571
00:29:23,667 --> 00:29:26,834
* and lingered there... *

572
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:32,667
I'm sorry, you can't
have that in here.

573
00:29:32,734 --> 00:29:34,000
What?

574
00:29:34,067 --> 00:29:35,534
This?

575
00:29:35,601 --> 00:29:37,167
It's a liability issue,
that's all,

576
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:39,767
In case somebody gets hurt.

577
00:29:39,834 --> 00:29:42,000
* and then we strolled *

578
00:29:42,067 --> 00:29:44,901
* that golden sand... *
no problem.

579
00:29:46,901 --> 00:29:53,601
* two sweethearts
and the summer wind *

580
00:29:54,434 --> 00:29:55,667
Hey.

581
00:29:55,734 --> 00:29:57,534
Can we have a talk?

582
00:29:57,601 --> 00:29:59,701
Yeah. what's up?

583
00:29:59,767 --> 00:30:01,667
Uh, first i would like
to say that i love you,

584
00:30:01,734 --> 00:30:03,300
And i--i--the thing i love
the most about you

585
00:30:03,367 --> 00:30:05,334
Is how much you care
about people--

586
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,234
Garcia, what?

587
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,567
What's going on?

588
00:30:07,634 --> 00:30:10,801
I think you need to cut
contact with tamara barnes.

589
00:30:10,868 --> 00:30:12,367
I didn't make contact
with her.

590
00:30:12,434 --> 00:30:13,634
She was at the police station.

591
00:30:13,701 --> 00:30:15,200
Yeah, ok, look me
in the eye and tell me

592
00:30:15,267 --> 00:30:16,634
That the first break
in this case

593
00:30:16,701 --> 00:30:18,534
You don't run right
to her and give her
the news yourself.

594
00:30:18,601 --> 00:30:20,400
Penelope, she lost her brother.
she just wants answers.

595
00:30:20,467 --> 00:30:22,601
I get it. i volunteer
counseling these families.

596
00:30:22,667 --> 00:30:23,901
I know what
she's going through.

597
00:30:23,968 --> 00:30:25,834
Then where is this
coming from?

598
00:30:25,901 --> 00:30:28,234
Ok, let's just ignore
the whole ethical dilemma,

599
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,901
'cause that's
just too, too big.

600
00:30:29,968 --> 00:30:31,534
And if you were
to testify on this case,

601
00:30:31,601 --> 00:30:32,767
The whole thing
would unravel

602
00:30:32,834 --> 00:30:34,634
If anyone were to find out
that you're involved

603
00:30:34,701 --> 00:30:35,901
With a member
of the victim's family.

604
00:30:35,968 --> 00:30:36,934
Whoa, stop.

605
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,434
I love you,

606
00:30:38,501 --> 00:30:40,334
And i respect you.
you know that.

607
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,467
But right now
you're way out of bounds.

608
00:30:42,534 --> 00:30:44,200
I'm not involved.

609
00:30:44,267 --> 00:30:46,801
The team is here
working on a case,

610
00:30:46,868 --> 00:30:48,634
And you're with her.

611
00:30:48,701 --> 00:30:50,100
You're involved.

612
00:30:50,167 --> 00:30:51,100
For your information,

613
00:30:51,167 --> 00:30:53,200
She lost it
back at the station,

614
00:30:53,267 --> 00:30:54,501
So i drove her home.

615
00:30:54,567 --> 00:30:55,567
End of story.

616
00:30:55,634 --> 00:30:57,667
But not for her.
derek,

617
00:30:57,734 --> 00:31:01,434
She's so sad and
so confused and angry

618
00:31:01,501 --> 00:31:04,601
And desperately looking
for anyone to swoop in
and make it all better,

619
00:31:04,667 --> 00:31:06,534
And unless you're
all in and can be there

620
00:31:06,601 --> 00:31:08,067
For every stage
of the grieving process,

621
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:10,400
You're just another
reason for her
to not trust the world.

622
00:31:10,467 --> 00:31:12,801
She's simply trying to
understand why this happened.

623
00:31:12,868 --> 00:31:15,701
There is no why,
and she'll make herself
crazy trying to find one.

624
00:31:15,767 --> 00:31:16,801
[footsteps approaching]

625
00:31:16,868 --> 00:31:18,300
Don't tell me.

626
00:31:18,367 --> 00:31:19,968
Bar in southeast, 2 dead.

627
00:31:20,033 --> 00:31:22,067
They're waiting for you.

628
00:31:22,133 --> 00:31:23,200
I got to go.

629
00:31:23,267 --> 00:31:24,400
Yeah.

630
00:31:24,467 --> 00:31:26,300
[siren]

631
00:31:37,334 --> 00:31:39,701
What are you doing here?

632
00:31:39,767 --> 00:31:42,067
Detective, we can argue
about this later.

633
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:45,367
Right now you have a crime scene
and we're here to help.

634
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,534
They nailed the bartender's
hands to the bar first.

635
00:31:59,734 --> 00:32:02,434
Other bastard
got off easier.

636
00:32:02,501 --> 00:32:04,467
They just plain beat him.

637
00:32:04,534 --> 00:32:06,334
I'm getting real sick
of us being right

638
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,801
And it just not mattering.

639
00:32:07,868 --> 00:32:09,767
What?
this is weird.

640
00:32:09,834 --> 00:32:12,267
The unsubs
are extremely physical.

641
00:32:12,334 --> 00:32:15,734
They beat their victims
mercilessly
with blunt objects.

642
00:32:15,801 --> 00:32:17,534
Why aren't these nails
pounded in?

643
00:32:17,601 --> 00:32:19,200
Probably used a nail gun.

644
00:32:19,267 --> 00:32:21,400
With all the gentrification
and turnover in housing

645
00:32:21,467 --> 00:32:23,834
In the neighborhood,
what's a common sight
these days?

646
00:32:23,901 --> 00:32:26,801
Builders,
contractors, and
construction workers.

647
00:32:26,868 --> 00:32:28,968
We wouldn't give it
a second thought.

648
00:32:29,033 --> 00:32:30,434
Morgan: wait a minute.

649
00:32:30,501 --> 00:32:33,434
Killing 4 people in that
first home invasion--

650
00:32:33,501 --> 00:32:35,501
That never made sense to me.

651
00:32:35,567 --> 00:32:38,801
Unsubs build
to something like that.

652
00:32:38,868 --> 00:32:41,167
What if this wasn't
their first murder?

653
00:32:41,234 --> 00:32:44,534
The first two rounds
of vandalism,
they were typical.

654
00:32:44,601 --> 00:32:48,300
Car windows smashed,
restaurants with
the plate glass broken.

655
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:52,033
But that last case,
right before the home invasion,

656
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,501
That was a random
construction site.

657
00:32:54,567 --> 00:32:56,834
A single-family townhouse.

658
00:32:56,901 --> 00:32:58,300
Prentiss, you flagged it
yourself.

659
00:32:58,367 --> 00:33:00,334
Yeah, yeah.

660
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,000
[dialing]

661
00:33:02,067 --> 00:33:03,834
Hey, garcia.

662
00:33:03,901 --> 00:33:07,367
I need the address
on that townhouse
that was vandalized.

663
00:33:08,534 --> 00:33:11,033
I don't understand
how we can help.

664
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,834
Sir, we believe that whoever
vandalized your house

665
00:33:12,901 --> 00:33:14,400
Is responsible for
the murders in the area.

666
00:33:14,467 --> 00:33:16,200
Oh, i know.
we've read the papers.

667
00:33:16,267 --> 00:33:18,434
But, honestly, that's not
something we're gonna
think about right now.

668
00:33:18,501 --> 00:33:19,567
We also think
it's possible

669
00:33:19,634 --> 00:33:21,534
That your home was
vandalized for a reason.

670
00:33:21,601 --> 00:33:23,467
What do you mean?

671
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:25,801
May we?

672
00:33:27,934 --> 00:33:29,300
Yes, please.

673
00:33:29,367 --> 00:33:31,501
Thank you.

674
00:33:32,834 --> 00:33:34,801
We believe there may
have been another murder

675
00:33:34,868 --> 00:33:37,367
Before the first one
the police became aware of.

676
00:33:37,434 --> 00:33:40,234
You think there might be
a body hidden here,
on our property?

677
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:43,033
It's possible.
at the very least,
the men we're looking for

678
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,234
May have worked here.

679
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,467
Oh, my god.

680
00:33:45,534 --> 00:33:47,634
Were there any issues with
workers during construction?

681
00:33:47,701 --> 00:33:48,801
No, nothing.

682
00:33:48,868 --> 00:33:50,767
Did anyone appear
overly confrontational?

683
00:33:50,834 --> 00:33:53,367
I just had contact
with our contractor,
and he was friendly.

684
00:33:53,434 --> 00:33:55,501
I understand people come
and go during construction,

685
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:58,400
But was there anyone at all
that you may have noticed

686
00:33:58,467 --> 00:34:00,267
Suddenly wasn't around?

687
00:34:00,334 --> 00:34:01,267
Oh, no.

688
00:34:01,334 --> 00:34:02,300
What is it?

689
00:34:02,367 --> 00:34:04,100
The contractor
i mentioned...

690
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:07,501
After the vandalism,
we called him
to oversee the repairs.

691
00:34:07,567 --> 00:34:08,801
He never called us back.

692
00:34:08,868 --> 00:34:10,634
The police report said
that every room

693
00:34:10,701 --> 00:34:12,834
In the house
was destroyed except one.

694
00:34:12,901 --> 00:34:15,567
Yeah, they smashed every
room except the nursery.
that one they didn't touch.

695
00:34:15,634 --> 00:34:17,033
We need to see it.

696
00:34:31,767 --> 00:34:33,834
[door opens]

697
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,200
This wall is structural.

698
00:34:59,701 --> 00:35:03,467
I wouldn't ask you this
unless i felt it was
incredibly important.

699
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:04,868
I need to open up
this wall.

700
00:35:04,934 --> 00:35:05,767
No.

701
00:35:05,834 --> 00:35:06,934
We can't live here
and not know.

702
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,534
Ma'am,

703
00:35:08,601 --> 00:35:12,033
I promise you, even if
i have to do every bit
of the work myself,

704
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,467
This wall will be repaired

705
00:35:13,534 --> 00:35:16,434
And it'll go right back
to being exactly
what you want.

706
00:35:17,801 --> 00:35:19,234
Please?

707
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,567
Ok.

708
00:35:24,767 --> 00:35:26,634
This is agent emily prentiss
with the fbi.

709
00:35:26,701 --> 00:35:29,901
I need an scsi unit.

710
00:35:35,868 --> 00:35:39,434
We've got a body.

711
00:35:56,784 --> 00:35:58,651
I can't be here.

712
00:36:00,184 --> 00:36:02,351
Let's move over here.

713
00:36:05,084 --> 00:36:07,384
Is there someplace
the two of you can stay?

714
00:36:07,451 --> 00:36:09,684
Yes. we have friends
i can call.

715
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:11,850
After you give
the police a statement,

716
00:36:11,917 --> 00:36:13,451
They can take you
to your friends' house.

717
00:36:13,517 --> 00:36:15,150
Thank you.

718
00:36:15,217 --> 00:36:16,983
Thank you.

719
00:36:20,451 --> 00:36:23,551
You think they'll be ok?

720
00:36:23,617 --> 00:36:25,250
I don't know.

721
00:36:25,317 --> 00:36:27,917
I mean, you redo
your dream home,

722
00:36:27,983 --> 00:36:30,718
About to start
a new chapter
of your life,

723
00:36:30,784 --> 00:36:33,384
And then this?

724
00:36:33,451 --> 00:36:35,017
How did you know?

725
00:36:36,617 --> 00:36:38,351
The other crime scenes
were brutal.

726
00:36:38,417 --> 00:36:40,184
But it also had control.

727
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,584
They took their time,
that type of m.o.

728
00:36:41,651 --> 00:36:44,384
Had to start before
the home invasions.

729
00:36:44,451 --> 00:36:46,883
This entire place
was destroyed
except this room. why?

730
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,883
Because they took the time
to rebuild the wall

731
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:50,217
Once they buried the contractor.

732
00:36:50,284 --> 00:36:51,217
Exactly.

733
00:36:51,284 --> 00:36:52,718
If they smashed
this place up,

734
00:36:52,784 --> 00:36:54,484
He could have been
discovered.

735
00:36:54,551 --> 00:36:56,484
But still, a body
inside the wall?

736
00:36:56,551 --> 00:36:59,184
It's like
a builders tradition.

737
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,617
You leave a little
something behind

738
00:37:00,684 --> 00:37:03,084
To send a message
to the people who may
do work down the road.

739
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,883
Front page
of a newspaper.

740
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:06,451
A photo of the
construction crew.

741
00:37:06,517 --> 00:37:08,651
It's like
a time capsule.

742
00:37:08,718 --> 00:37:10,217
Ok.

743
00:37:10,284 --> 00:37:14,384
Ok, so what would you need
to rebuild this wall?

744
00:37:14,451 --> 00:37:15,584
Drywall, brickwork,

745
00:37:15,651 --> 00:37:17,551
Electrical?

746
00:37:17,617 --> 00:37:19,351
I'm gonna call garcia.

747
00:37:21,517 --> 00:37:24,250
[line ringing]

748
00:37:24,317 --> 00:37:25,250
Hey, girl.

749
00:37:25,317 --> 00:37:26,250
Hey.

750
00:37:26,317 --> 00:37:27,184
Are we good?

751
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,250
Yeah, we're good.

752
00:37:28,317 --> 00:37:30,184
Ok.

753
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,617
What do you need?

754
00:37:31,684 --> 00:37:33,917
Ok, pull up the address
of the townhouse
that was vandalized.

755
00:37:33,983 --> 00:37:35,084
Got it.

756
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:37,484
Ok. give me work permits
for the contractor.

757
00:37:38,451 --> 00:37:40,617
That would be...james morris.

758
00:37:40,684 --> 00:37:42,351
Is he our unsub?

759
00:37:42,417 --> 00:37:44,850
No, actually, i'm afraid
he's our first victim.

760
00:37:44,917 --> 00:37:46,484
Does it list morris'
subcontractors?

761
00:37:46,551 --> 00:37:47,718
Yes, it does.

762
00:37:47,784 --> 00:37:50,217
All right, i need
all the names
and addresses

763
00:37:50,284 --> 00:37:53,417
For whoever was hired
to do the electrical,
brickwork, and drywall.

764
00:37:53,484 --> 00:37:55,950
That would be
3 names, one address.

765
00:37:56,017 --> 00:37:58,351
So they do live together.

766
00:37:58,417 --> 00:38:00,617
Yeah. 5058 b street
near anacostia,

767
00:38:00,684 --> 00:38:03,250
Particulars coming
to you...now.

768
00:38:03,317 --> 00:38:05,117
Thanks, babe.

769
00:38:05,184 --> 00:38:06,351
We were right.

770
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:08,850
They're a pack.

771
00:38:18,718 --> 00:38:19,784
We go in first.

772
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:21,484
It's your case.

773
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:30,451
Police!

774
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:31,784
Fbi!

775
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:33,517
Move!

776
00:38:34,751 --> 00:38:36,751
Get him down!

777
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,117
Ow! ow!

778
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:41,684
Where are the other two?

779
00:38:41,751 --> 00:38:43,684
You gotta be kidding me,
right?

780
00:38:43,751 --> 00:38:45,184
Dave.

781
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:47,617
You like that, sir?

782
00:38:47,684 --> 00:38:50,084
I got more.

783
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:54,017
Where are the others?

784
00:38:54,084 --> 00:38:55,517
Go to hell.

785
00:38:55,584 --> 00:38:57,818
Garcia, i need
vehicle information
on all the residents.

786
00:38:57,883 --> 00:38:59,617
Get him up.

787
00:39:01,784 --> 00:39:02,883
Got it.

788
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:05,517

790
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:11,351
I also need to know
if they're registered
on any jobs right now.

791
00:39:11,417 --> 00:39:13,184
I got a visual on
the station wagon

792
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:16,184
Just south of 8th,
heading toward
half street, southeast.

793
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:19,351
That's right next to
their current work site.

794
00:39:21,451 --> 00:39:23,150
You know what gets me?

795
00:39:23,217 --> 00:39:27,084
See, we figured you were
down and out, pissed off.

796
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:29,150
But you're out here working.

797
00:39:29,217 --> 00:39:31,551
What is so god-awful
about your life

798
00:39:31,617 --> 00:39:34,684
That you gotta take it out
on the rest of the world?

799
00:39:34,751 --> 00:39:36,617
It was fun, boss.

800
00:39:36,684 --> 00:39:39,917
Deploy tactical units

801
00:39:39,983 --> 00:39:40,917
Thanks.

802
00:39:40,983 --> 00:39:42,983
We got 'em.

803
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:45,217
Forget him, morgan.
he's nothing.

804
00:39:45,284 --> 00:39:47,451

[tires screeching]

807
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:04,617
How many we got?

808
00:40:04,684 --> 00:40:06,617
[sirens]

809
00:40:06,684 --> 00:40:08,451

[tires screeching]

811
00:40:10,751 --> 00:40:12,517
That ought to do it.

812
00:40:16,784 --> 00:40:18,484
I got snipers up high,
i got a team around back.

813
00:40:18,551 --> 00:40:20,551
Once we're sure there's
not a hostage inside,

814
00:40:20,617 --> 00:40:21,950
I'll give the order
to breach.

815
00:40:24,983 --> 00:40:26,484
You leaving?

816
00:40:27,451 --> 00:40:29,317
You've got this under control.

817
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,818
Is he just gonna
walk away?

818
00:40:38,883 --> 00:40:40,950
Looks like it.

819
00:40:43,651 --> 00:40:47,484
Just when i thought he was
back on top of his game.

820
00:40:47,551 --> 00:40:49,250
You got at least 2 dozen cops,

821
00:40:49,317 --> 00:40:51,317
All looking for revenge.

822
00:40:51,384 --> 00:40:53,784
You got two
psychopaths inside,

823
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:56,917
Ready to play out
their fantasy end.

824
00:40:56,983 --> 00:40:59,417
You want to take
your shot...

825
00:40:59,484 --> 00:41:01,117
Take it.

826
00:41:02,818 --> 00:41:04,818
Our job is done.

827
00:41:09,584 --> 00:41:11,751
Is it time?

828
00:41:11,818 --> 00:41:13,784
What the hell, right?

829
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:16,384
Just keep your head up
and you hold this
son of a bitch out front

830
00:41:16,451 --> 00:41:17,883
Like it's a gun.
