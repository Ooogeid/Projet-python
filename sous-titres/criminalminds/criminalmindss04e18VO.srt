00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:14,440
- Mr. Hotchner?
- Yes.

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,970
- Please,he's been waiting.
- Thank you.

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,940
You're the only person he's asked
for. You must be good friends.

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,530
Actually,we worked together
once,about 10 years ago.

6
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,420
He'll be lucky if he
makes it through the night.

7
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:34,080
Anything you do to ease
his pain will be a blessing.

00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,370

10
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,740
Hi,tom.

11
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,020
You came. Thank you.

12
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,340
Of course,tom. But I don't
know why you asked for me.

13
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:01,720
The reaper.

14
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,580
I shut down the investigation
without an arrest.

15
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:08,610
The killings stopped.

16
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,940
And I sent you away.

17
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,530
You deserve to know why.

18
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,910
Ok. Tell me.

19
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,840
A deal with the devil.

20
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:33,740
"if you stop hunting
me,i'll stop hunting them.

21
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,840
For as long as we both shall
live," "til death do us part.

22
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:41,200
If you agree to my terms," take out
a personal ad in the michigan post."

23
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,520
This is a contract.

24
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:44,700
Which we both honored.

25
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,550
You know we weren't
close to catching him.

26
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:51,530
If it didn't work,i could have
restarted the investigation,but it did.

27
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,080
The killing stopped.

28
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,710
I waited 6 weeks-- 6 weeks--
before I sent you away.

29
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,010
But,tom,how do you know he stopped?

30
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,200
- He could have just gone someplace else.
- No.

31
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,970
I've kept watch. I know he stopped.

32
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,700
Sooner or later we would
have caught a break.

33
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,810
How many people would he have killed
before we caught that break,huh?

34
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,470
Would all those lives be worth it?

35
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,110
We don't get to make those decisions.

36
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,130
We don't let them get away with it.

37
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,450
Then you'll have to pay for my sin.

38
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,820
How do you mean?

39
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,580
The contract's about to expire.

40
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,910
I've felt him watching me. He
knows. He's been waiting for this.

41
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,470
You think he's gonna
start killing again.

42
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:46,560
I did it to save lives.

43
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,840
Please tell the victims'
families that I'm sorry. Please.

44
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,840
Tell them-- tell
them I had no choice.

45
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,190
I'll tell them you're sorry.

Sergeant o'mara has
the number. Thank you.

49
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,960
- Come in.
- I found it.

52
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,940
Yes.

53
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,590
'Cause I found it,do I get
to know what it's about?

54
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,890
- The reaper.
- Like... The boston reaper?

55
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,150
I didn't even know the
b.a.u.worked on that case.

56
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:36,090
1998. It was my first case
for the b.a.u.as lead profiler.

57
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:40,590
Correct me if I'm wrong,but we don't have a
profile for the reaper in our system,do we?

58
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,970
That'll be all,penelope.
You can go home now.

59
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,570
- Ok. Good night,sir.
- Good night.

60
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,490
This morning.

61
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:38,920
Yes,it is a good thing that
he went quickly in the end.

62
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:43,530
Well,i appreciate you calling
me. Thank you very much.

64
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,410
How bad is it?

65
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,940
We have 2 flats.

66
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,710
How did we get 2 flats?

67
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,340
I don't know.

68
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,380
All right,i'll call triple-a.

69
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:28,210
What if it was us? You'd want
somebody to stop,wouldn't you?

70
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,840
Hey,you all right?

71
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:33,360
Uh,no,i got 2 flats,only got one spare.

72
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,640
Nina hale. Route 128.

73
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,210
You want to try one
of mine,see if it fits?

74
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:42,110
Oh,thanks. My girlfriend's
on with triple-a.

75
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,900
Well,i'll give you my address.

76
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,580
If it works,you can send me a check.

77
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,720
I mean,if you want to stay out
here all night,that's up to you.

78
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,080
I just wanted to make sure you're ok.

79
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,900
Hey,you know what? Sure.

80
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,040
Give it a shot,right?

81
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,180
You got it.

82
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,780
Our car has 2 flat tires and
we don't have a second spare.

83
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,160
Yeah. Just past needham.

84
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,130
I really appreciate this.

85
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,090
My pleasure.

86
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,780
Evan? Evan!

87
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,200
Give me your watch.

88
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,720
Please. Please don't hurt us.

89
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,970
This won't hurt.

90
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,170
Please,no.

91
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,990
I'm not gonna shoot you.

92
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,780
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

93
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:04,180
Oh,nina... I hit my head.

94
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,770
Nina's dead.

95
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,610
Are you scared?

96
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,440

Roman author publilius syrus.

102
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,410
Bye.

103
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,530
You wanted to know immediately
about any unusual boston homicides?

104
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,460
We're going to boston.

105
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,200
Well--shouldn't we wait
for the official request?

106
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:23,330
- We haven't been
invited--  - we will be.

107
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:29,000
Well,it looks like
we're going to boston.

108
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:35,630
"the reaper is driven by a need to
dominate,control,and manipulate."

109
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,450
So then why would he offer a deal
that would stop him from doing that?

110
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:42,450
Well,killing gave him power,but after
so many,the payoff began to diminish.

111
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,700
So he decided to switch tactics.

112
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:47,810
Offering the deal gave him the
ultimate power,better even than killing.

113
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:50,880
He manipulated the police
into voluntarily surrendering.

114
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,150
He even got it in writing.

115
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:54,050
He won. Why start killing again?

116
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:57,580
Well,because the only person who knew he'd
won,the person he made the deal with,just died.

117
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:01,320
Narcissistic killers need other
people to recognize their power.

118
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,100
That's why they contact the media.

119
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:04,750
So how did he stop for 10 years?

120
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:10,060
In night of the reaper,the author suggests he
had been arrested for an unrelated crime or died.

121
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,360
Perhaps he's trying to
correct that misconception.

122
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,070
What has he been doing all this time?

123
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,040
Planning what he would do
if he started killing again.

124
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,170
So from '95 to '98,he
shoots,stabs,and bludgeons 21 victims.

125
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:24,540
Men,women,all ages,all types.

126
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:26,180
No specific victimology or m.o.

127
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,550
How did you build a profile from there?

128
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,710
We didn't. Shaunessy sent us
home before we had a chance.

129
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:35,220
Btk,the zodiac,and the
reaper all have similarities.

130
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:39,630
They're all highly intelligent,disciplined,sadistic
killers who name themselves in the press.

131
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,060
Highly intelligent may be
a bit of an understatement.

132
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,660
The reaper and the zodiac
killer have never been arrested.

133
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:49,130
The btk killer was only caught after 25 years
because he went to the press to counter a book

134
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:52,670
That said he'd died,moved away,or
been locked up,just like this one.

135
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,440
Speaking of the media,when this
gets out,it's going to be a frenzy.

136
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,620
If they get wind of this,they're
going to be all over the boston police.

137
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:01,980
The longer we can float the copycat story,the
better chance we'll have of catching him.

138
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,960
Rossi,prentiss,and morgan,go to the field
office,set up shop,go through everything there.

139
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:08,030
Jj and reid,we'll go to the crime scene.

140
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,020
I worked the reaper case for 18 months.

141
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,540
If there's any proof that this horrible
crime is anything more than a copycat,

142
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,780
I'll be the first one to let you know.

143
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,030
Sorry I haven't called you back.

144
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,690
As you can see,I'm busy.

145
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,940
It's not a copycat,mike.

146
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,290
I wish it were,but it isn't.

147
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:26,740
Yeah,no offense,you don't know
that,and I didn't invite you in.

148
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,800
Shaunessy did.

149
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,550
Want to invite us in?

150
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,770
What was he thinking?

151
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,410
This could destroy the department.

152
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,060
I know.

153
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:50,120
This is ssa jennifer jareau,dr.
Spencer reid,sergeant mike o'mara.

154
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,810
Uh,we're setting up at the field office.

155
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:56,910
Ok. I'm done here. Give
them anything they want.

156
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:58,940
Thank you.

157
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:02,510
Nina hale,19,and evan harvey,23.

158
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:07,000
Nina's throat was slashed,she
was stabbed 46 times.

159
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,820
Evan was bludgeoned and then shot.

160
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,330
No shell casings were found.

161
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,600
He preferred revolvers,. 44 magnum.

162
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,360
"the younger the female victim,the more time
he spends with them,usually with a knife."

163
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:19,390
Tan line on r wrist. Probably
wearing a watch of some sort.

164
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,770
Do we have his wallet?

165
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,630
The reaper took items from each
victim and placed them on the next,

166
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:33,190
so as to make sure we knew it was him.

167
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,980
No corrective lens requirement.

168
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,390
The glasses aren't his?

169
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:38,580
He only took glasses from
one victim--the ninth.

170
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,060
We should have found them on the tenth
and we didn't. They were never found.

171
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,300
What was so special
about the ninth victim?

172
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,280
He survived.

173
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,110
George foyet,28,was the ninth victim
and the only one to survive the reaper.

174
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,750
Not for lack of trying.

175
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:53,230
Amanda bertrand,19,his date for
the evening,was not as lucky.

176
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:59,870
He likes to attack them inside or near their
cars,at night,on poorly lit,less populated roads.

177
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:03,480
Foyet id he approached them
pretending to be a lost tourist.

178
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:06,250
In the hospital,we put
foyet with a sketch artist.

179
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:10,300
The reaper always uses some sort of ruse to
get close to and spend time with his victims.

180
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,220
The eye,as he depicts
it,e eye of providence,

181
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,610
A symbol adopted by the u.s.government and
incorporated into the great seal in 1782 with the words,

182
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,940
Annuit coeptis inscribed beneath.

183
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:26,230
That's latin for "providence"--or
fate-- has favored our undertakings.

184
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:29,890
The reaper seems to see himself
as the personification of fate.

185
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,230
So,how did foyet survive?

186
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,180
911. What's your emergency?

187
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,190
I just murdered 2 more.

188
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,490
Excuse me,sir,did you
say you murdered someone?

189
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,980
Victims 8 and 9.

190
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:47,700
By a silver toyota on
riverton past the tyson quarry.

191
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,640
That call was made from a pay phone
about a mile from the crime scene.

192
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,270
Emts arrived 15 minutes later.

193
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,190
Bertrand was d.o.a.,foyet
barely breathing.

194
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:59,620
So the reaper made one of these calls after each of
his killings telling police where to find the bodies.

195
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,110
Until this one,the ninth.

196
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:04,000
If he hadn't made this call,foyet
wouldn't have been found in time.

197
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,060
The call saved him.

198
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,780
So the reaper didn't make
any11 calls after this one.

199
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,890
- Yeah?
- Looks like he learned his lesson.

200
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:14,250
There's a reason he left foyet's
glasses at the last crime scene.

201
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,550
Foyet could be in danger.

202
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,620
We'll find him.

203
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:19,090
Hotch,there's a reporter outside
insisting on speaking with you.

204
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,300
Roy colson. He says he knows you.

205
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,120
Roy.

206
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,240
Agent hotchner.

207
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,350
So if it's just a copycat,what
are you doing here?

208
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,170
Helping the police catch him.

209
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,380
Is that your story? Come on,i
wrote the book on this guy.

210
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:39,170
I even sent you a signed
copy. I assume you got it.

211
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:42,510
Officially,we have no reason to think
that he's anything but a copycat.

212
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,880
We,how about unofficially?

213
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,470
What's more important to you,roy,getting
the story or getting the killer?

214
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,230
I-,uh... I spent time
with the families.

215
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,840
I,uh,i told the victims' stories.

216
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:56,640
Now,you would know that
if you read my book.

217
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:59,490
It's a good book,roy.

218
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,890
You treated the victims with
respect and you treated us fairly.

219
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,600
- Every dime I made went to the families.
- I know. That's why I came down.

220
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,450
The minute I have something
I can say,i'll call you.

221
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,140
Thanks.

222
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,820
If it's him,it won't be long.

223
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,070
I don't believe it. Unbelievable.

224
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,560
Honey,please don't.

225
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:29,160
I'm not speeding,I'm not drunk.

226
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,050
Good evening,officer.

227
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,950
License,registration,and
proof of insurance.

228
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:52,680
I'll be right back.

229
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:55,500
He hasn't even told
me why he stopped us.

230
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,580
Let's just get this over with.

231
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,170
I'm gonna let you off with a warning.

232
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,820
A warning? For what?

233
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,360
You were at the wrong
place at the wrong time.

234
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,560
Excuse me?

235
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:17,350
And now I'm gonna kill your wife,arthur.

236
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,370
Please! No!

237
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:36,240
Another couple. Much older this time.

238
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,210
One shot and one stabbed.

239
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,530
No reason to stop out here.

240
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,310
His license and registration
are out of his wallet.

241
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,480
Looks like he used a cop ruse.

242
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:49,370
Good spot. Isolated,few drivers.

243
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,190
He left nina hale's watch.

244
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,130
Ok. So what'd he take?

245
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,310
His wedding ring.

246
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:01,240
Arthur and diane lanessa. Weymouth.

247
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:03,950
Married 32 years.

248
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:07,620
They were coming home from the elks
where they played bingo twice a week.

249
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:11,660
- I gotta go make notification.
- You want company?

250
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,000
I got it.

251
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,240
Looks like he went through her purse.

252
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:25,990
Any idea what he was looking for?

253
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,860
The question mark is new.

254
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,980
It's for us. He's saying it's not fate.

255
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:53,770
He's saying we had 10 years to save them
and that these latest ones are on us.

256
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:57,110
You got all that from one
question mark. That's impressive.

257
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,860
I may know him better than I've let on.

258
00:16:58,890 --> 00:16:59,680
At does that mean?

259
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:02,190
It means that there is
a profile on the reaper.

260
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:05,510
- I thought we were called off before we had one.
- We were.

261
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,460
I had just started the profile and then he
stopped killing,so officially we were done.

262
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,590
- But this case...
- It stuck with you.

263
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,950
I kept coming back to it over the
years and I worked on it alone.

264
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,360
So you never shared it with anyone.

265
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:22,750
I know I'm always preaching that profiling
is a collaborative effort,but this one wasn't.

266
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,830
I don't know,maybe if-- if I was wrong,i
was gonna head us in the wrong direction.

267
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,080
Now you think you're right.

268
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,290
The more I see,the more
accurate I think it may be.

269
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:37,330
Ok. Then we need to hear it.

270
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,450
The reaper fits a profile
we refer to as an omnivore.

271
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:45,950
Unlike most serial killers,an omnivore
doesn't target a specific victim type.

272
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,320
Although he tends to focus on his
younger female victims with his knife,

273
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,870
He essentially is a predator
who will kill anyone.

274
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,670
Why is he so democratic?

275
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,420
Because his kills aren't just about his victims.
He needs recognition. He needs us to know.

276
00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:02,250
The symbols,the placement of prior
victims' possessions on subsequent victims--

277
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,100
- It's all for us.
- Why?

278
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:07,350
Power. The shaunessy letter is
the clearest example of this.

279
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,250
He manipulated tom shaunessy into
literally surrendering to him.

280
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,830
The burden was too much to bear.

281
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:16,710
In very real sense,tom shaunessy
was the reaper's 22nd victim.

282
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,950
Like btk killer dennis rader,the
reaper is extremely disciplined.

283
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,560
In his everyday life,this will
very likely make him so inflexible,

284
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:27,060
He can't keep close relationships
or work closely with others.

285
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:32,750
I believe our killer has another interest that
may give us our best opportunity to catch him.

286
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,920
The reaper's last victim
was an older woman.

287
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,060
He killed her
quickly,with a single shot.

288
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:41,540
The prior,younger victim he spent
more time with and stabbed 46 times.

289
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,640
Why?

290
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,290
He pays special attention to
his younger female victims,

291
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,160
And his weapon of choice
with them is the knife,

292
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,830
A substitute instrument
for bodily penetration.

293
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:53,440
And the younger the victim,the
more time and effort he spends.

294
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,880
I think our guy is a hebophile.

295
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:56,990
Hebophile?

296
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:01,740
Someone who's attracted to adolescent
post-pubescent children. Teenagers.

297
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:05,110
Look for men with access to authority--
high school teachers,counselors,coaches,

298
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:09,540
And anyone who's been charged with sex crimes
against teenage girls in the last 10 years.

299
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:12,020
That's all for now. Thank you.

300
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,650
Garcia can't find george foyet.

301
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,850
- I've got nothing,sir.
- What do you mean?

302
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:20,290
He's gone. I mean,he's completely
off the grid,and he's gone.

303
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,790
How is that possible?

304
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:26,340
9 months after he was released from the
hospital,he,uh,quit his job,sold his car,

305
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:31,570
Closed his bank accounts,canceled his
credit cards,cell phone,apartment,everything.

306
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:34,550
He has no paper,thus he has no trail,and
I can't find him 'cause he's gone.

307
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,630
You think it's intentional?

308
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:39,040
It's more than that. Like,even dead
people stay on the grid for decades.

309
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:43,060
Take it from me,erasing yourself
like this,it's extremely difficult.

310
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,430
It takes commitment.

311
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,140
You'd have to be willing to cut
every tie of everything and everyone

312
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:52,310
you've ever known in your entire life.
It's like-- it's like killing yourself.

313
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,620
I gotta say,this is impressive.

314
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:56,750
Well,after what the guy's
been through,can you blame him?

315
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:00,610
Foyet's the only living person who knows what
the reaper looks like and he's still out there.

316
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,850
But it doesn't change the fact
that we still need to find him.

317
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:03,880
I'll keep looking.

318
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,450
Garcia,we don't have much time.

319
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,900
I know,sir.

320
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,270
He would have to
completely isolate himself.

321
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,620
He's totally alone.

322
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,000
But how do you cut all ties?

323
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:15,380
You'd have to talk to someone,right?

324
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,490
- Colson.
- Roy. Aaron hotchner. I need a favor.

325
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,650
How did colson find this guy?

326
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,800
He interviewed foyet extensively
for his book. They kept in touch.

327
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,420
- They're friends?
- Sort of.

328
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:37,680
But foyet wouldn't give
him his phone number.

329
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:40,140
He gave him one of his aliases,though.

330
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:43,600
That's him.

331
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,040
George foyet?

332
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:55,920
It's ok. We're fbi. This is
agent rossi. I'm agent hotchner.

333
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,880
We met once before. Do you remember?

334
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,800
Yeah,i remember.

335
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,070
- Would you mind if we get off the street,please?
- Sure.

336
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:18,220
- How'd you guys find me?
- Roy colson.

337
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,640
Well,is this gonna take long?

338
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,860
'Cause I really can't be late for work.

339
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,130
What do you do?

340
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,950
I'm a freelance computer
specialist with the city.

341
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:35,360
We're sorry to bother you. We'll
make it as quick as possible.

342
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,850
This yours?

343
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,060
I knew it wasn't a copycat.

344
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:00,740
Thank you.

345
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,390
I'm sorry.

346
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:11,300
I was gonna propose to her that night...

347
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:15,380
At the restaurant,but I got cold feet.

348
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:18,240
The ring was still in my
pocket when he approached us.

349
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,040
He said he was lost.

350
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,220
He had one of those
sightseeing booklets.

351
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:26,160
- I was looking at it when he stabbed me.
- Yeah...

352
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,060
Perfect
timing--

353
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:31,010
mr. Foyet,you don't need
to go through this again.

354
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,810
I couldn't move.

355
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,760
I just sat there,bleeding.

356
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,520
I watched him kill mandy.

357
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:42,550
He stabbed her 67 times.

358
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:47,680
Do you know how long it takes
to stab somebody 67 times?

359
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:51,490
I never found the ring.

360
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:55,000
He should have left your
glasses on his next victim.

361
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,680
But he didn't.

362
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,050
He held on to them all this time.

363
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:04,030
Well,you think he's got
some special interest in me?

364
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,520
I've been living with that
possibility for the past 11 years.

365
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:13,980
Have you received any strange
letters or calls? Hang-ups?

366
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:17,040
I keep residences under different names.

367
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:19,650
I move between them randomly.

368
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,590
He likes to get you in
a car,so I take the bus.

369
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,390
Believe me,I've gone to
great lengths to make sure

370
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,180
that none of the things you've
just mentioned ever happened.

371
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:33,960
We'll need your other names and
residences so we can reach you.

372
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,400
We can take you someplace
safe until this is over.

373
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,300
No. Boston's my home.

374
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,310
It's the o thing I promised I
would never let him take from me.

375
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,350
Then we'll protect you here.

376
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:51,260
You can't protect me. Nobody can.

377
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:00,720
Please be careful with this. Please.

378
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:05,070
It's safe with us.

379
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:10,710
He's just a man. Nothing more.

380
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,710
Then why can't you catch him?

381
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,640
We will.

382
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,710
Thank you for your time.

383
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:26,160
Hey,uh,this was dropped
off at my office.

384
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,160
I'll get this to the lab.

385
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,590
Are you going to run the story,roy?

386
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,100
If I don't,he'll just
give it to somebody else.

387
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,950
Maybe,maybe not. To him you're special.

388
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,530
He wants you to know why he stopped.

389
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,730
What do you mean?

390
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,540
You wrote his biography,roy.

391
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:50,420
Believe me,over the last 10 years,he's
read those words thousands of times.

392
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,890
Your book has sustained him.

393
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,690
In his mind,nobody knows
him better than you do.

394
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,080
Nobody cares for him like you.

395
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,640
You remember what it was like here
10 years ago on the street? The fear?

396
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,950
And that's when people trusted
the police. Not this time.

397
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,350
Not if you tell them about shaunessy.

398
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,130
But it's a hell of a story. Run with it.

399
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,960
Do you have any idea what
you're asking me to do?

400
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:17,120
I'm not asking you to do anything.

401
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:21,360
This is the biggest story of my
life,and it's mine. It's an exclusive.

402
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:26,820
I can offer you full and exclusive access to the
fbi's behavioral analysis unit after we catch him.

403
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:29,650
- Right. If I hold the story.
- I didn't say that.

404
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,750
Full access to the entire unit?

405
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,680
- Nobody's ever had that.
- I know.

406
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,630
But...

407
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:40,110
But--i mean,what if
you can't catch him?

408
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,750
Well,that's a risk
you're gonna have to take.

409
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:58,450
Hotchner.

410
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:03,840
Who is this?

411
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:07,950
If you stop hunting
me,i'll stop hunting them.

412
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:11,360
You think i'd take that?

413
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:14,090
It's a good deal.

414
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:18,540
I've misjudged you. I thought
you were smarter than this.

415
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,340
You should take it.

416
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:23,740
And you've misjudged me.

417
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,880
This is your last chan.

418
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:29,220
I don't make deals.

419
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,970
I'm the guy who hunts guys like you.

420
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,750
There are no guys like me.

421
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,950
You all think that.

422
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,920
You'll regret this.

423
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:43,190
I'll see you soon.

424
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,740
Almost missed you.

425
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,900
Drive.

426
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,380
Make a right at the next light.

427
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:17,780
I want your jewelry and your wallets.

428
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:22,490
Pull over right here.

429
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:27,580
Just take the money.
Nobody needs to get hurt.

430
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,490
Actually,they do.

431
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:55,520
6 bodies,not including the driver.

432
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,780
He put them down with the gun,or more likely
guns,and finished them off with his knife.

433
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:06,620
Arthur lanessa's wedding ring.

434
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,250
What did he take?

435
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,190
Does it matter?

436
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:21,770
What's going on with you?

437
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:27,730
He called me tonight at my
hotel and offered me the deal.

438
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,740
What did you say?

439
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,240
I hung up on him.

440
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,390
And then he does this.

441
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:36,210
So you think this is your fault?

442
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:42,440
It is.

443
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:45,430
Well,here,use mine. You convinced me.

444
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,700
No,no,you hung up on him. You
practically killed them yourself.

445
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:50,930
Go ahead,get it over
with. Don't worry about us.

446
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,350
We'll get this guy without you.

447
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,640
Dave,i had 10 years to
do something about it.

448
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,790
Shaunessy made the deal.
The killing stopped.

449
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,230
He closed the case and
sent the b.a.u.away.

450
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:03,910
For 10 years,you worked on
other cases. Active cases.

451
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,420
But I kept coming back to this one.

452
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,490
I kept coming back to this profile.

453
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,550
I was retired.

454
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:12,940
Should I blame myself for every victim who
got killed while is was on my book tour?

455
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:19,890
Look,if you want to end up like shaunessy,like
gideon,blaming yourself for everything,you go ahead.

456
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:24,840
But that voice in your head-- it's
not your conscience,it's your ego.

457
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:28,660
This isn't about us,aaron,it's
about the bad guys.

458
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:32,860
That's why we profile
them. It's their fault.

459
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,980
We're just guys doing a job.

460
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,960
And when we stop doing
it,someone else will.

461
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:43,200
Trust me. I know.

462
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,860
You can put that away.

463
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:50,490
You sure?

464
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,860
It's a little dramatic,don't you think?

465
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:55,110
My wife always said I had
a flair for the dramatic.

466
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,930
- Which one?
- All of them.

467
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:01,640
- Thanks.
- Anytime.

468
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,960
Go ahead and run your story.

469
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:07,310
It won't matter after this.

470
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,320
I am,but I'm goa leave the shaunessy deal
out I don't think the families need to know,

471
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,180
Not at least until you catch him.

472
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:14,500
I appreciate that.

473
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,870
Foyet called. He wants to see me.

474
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,420
Is he mad that you gave him to us?

475
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:23,370
I just think he doesn't have anyone to talk
to,and the reaper's killing him,too,only slower.

476
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,840
He wouldn't be the first.

477
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:27,690
He never used code before. Why now?

478
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,430
They're not part of
a pattern or equation.

479
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,840
Mathematically,they're insignificant.

480
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,870
Maybe so,but I know
I've seen them before.

481
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:38,420
Foyet said he likes to attack people
in their cars. Tonight he hit a bus.

482
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:41,060
Which is why foyet only takes a bus.

483
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:43,100
It was the number 7.

484
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,810
And it stops right in
front of foyet's apartment.

485
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:50,280
- He knows where foyet lives.
- And he wants us to know it.

486
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:52,080
1439.

487
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,440
The apartment you interviewed
him in today was 1439 yarbrough.

488
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:01,190
The other addresses he gave us.

489
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:05,590
201 south brookline. 1488 edenhurst.

490
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,170
The numbers on the bus
are foyet's addresses.

491
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,990
We'll split up and cover each address.

492
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,820
I'll take the back.

493
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,260
There's no one here.

494
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:35,490
- We got nothing.
- Same thing here.

495
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,770
Have you heard from morgan?

496
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:59,660
Wake up,derek. It's time to die.

497
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,430
If it's any consolation,i don't
think he knew what hit him.

498
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:16,690
I'll call jj.

499
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,080
The bureau's gonna have
to make a statement.

500
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,300
You all right?

501
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,740
He took my credentials.

502
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:41,220
The important thing is you're ok.

503
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:46,660
He left me this.

504
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:49,440
Power and manipulation.

505
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,330
Don't let him get to you.

506
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:54,880
Yeah,right.

507
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,950
Ow,come on,man.

508
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:03,210
Prentiss,he's telling me,"i had you."

509
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,510
Morgan,you're alive.

510
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,920
- You know why?
- It doesn't really matter.

511
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:11,340
I'm sitting here because
I was knocked out cold.

512
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:12,940
He couldn't torture me.

513
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:18,170
He likes to interact with his victims,to tell
them he's going to kill them before he does.

514
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:20,520
Or by letting them know he could have.

515
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:22,370
Hotch is right.

516
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,900
He's just trying to get into your head.

517
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:27,330
Right or wrong,he had me.

518
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,400
O'mara was clearly killed
outside. This was someone else.

519
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:36,290
There's signs of a
struggle and a lot of blood.

520
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,480
- But no body.
- Just the drag marks.

521
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,520
The human body holds 5 quarts of blood.

522
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,840
I'd say there's a little
more than half that here.

523
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:46,490
Whoever the bleeder was,they
lost too much to survive.

524
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,020
Foyet?

525
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:52,170
It was his worst fear,that the reaper
would come back and finish the job.

526
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,720
We offered him protection.
He refused. It was his choice.

527
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:01,270
Why is he so focused on foyet?
What's so special about him?

528
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,920
He was his only surviving victim,the
only one he couldn't defeat.

529
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,670
But he's not a threat. Defeating
him would be no great accomplishment.

530
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,750
There's something there
that we're missing.

531
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:12,170
What about the girlfriend,amanda
bertrand? What do we know about her?

532
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:15,410
19. A freshman. She came her
from michigan to go to school.

533
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:18,760
Foyet was a teacher's assistant
in one of amanda's courses.

534
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:22,220
Michigan. Where the reaper had
shaunessy post the personal ad.

535
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:24,270
That can't be a coincidence.

536
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,070
He told us she was the love of
his life,that he was gonna propose.

537
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,720
But she just got here from michigan.
They only met when the class started.

538
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:31,120
How long had she been in the class?

539
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,240
4 weeks.

540
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,640
So it was either love
at first sight or what?

541
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,810
Foyet was lying?

542
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:38,620
He's a 28-year-old teacher's
assistant in freshman classes.

543
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:41,450
That gives him plenty
of access to young girls.

544
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,010
- Garcia.
- I'm here.

545
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,420
What are foyet's aliases?

546
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:50,110
I want you to look up in boston city records
kevin baskin,miles holden,and william parker.

547
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:52,280
Try the department of education.

548
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,480
Well played,sir.So they all work
for the department of education,

549
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:58,560
they're all substitute teachers,
And they all teach computer science.

550
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:00,750
- High school?
- Yeah.

551
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:04,340
Oops. Scratch that. They're not all
working for the department of education.

552
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:05,630
- They're not?
- No.

553
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:09,200
William parker was fired for alleged
inappropriate behavior with his female students.

554
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:14,290
Do you know how long it takes
to stab somebody 67 times?

555
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,500
Hotch?

556
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,590
Why can't you catch him?

557
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,500
Colson went to see foyet.

558
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:26,830
Garcia,i need you to locate
roy colson's cell phone.

559
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:28,410
George foyet is the reaper.

560
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:31,640
Oh,god. Ok,triangulating now.

561
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:34,260
I got it. 2633 south budlong.

562
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,200
That must be an address
that foyet didn't give us.

563
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,490
Hey,george.

564
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,950
- Nice to see you. It's been a while.
- Come on in.

565
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,930
You brought your laptop. Good.

566
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:52,510
- Just set it up over there on the table.
- Ok.

567
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:56,090
He stabbed amanda bertrand to death,he
drove a mile,he called 911,he went back,

568
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,870
And he inflicted those
wounds on himself.

569
00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:00,660
He knew ems would get
there in time to save him.

570
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:04,300
Between the phone call and the severity of his
wounds,we never considered him as a suspect.

571
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:05,650
Why would he do it?

572
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,460
It put him at the core
of the investigation.

573
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,840
Everything we had came from him.

574
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:13,620
He left his own glasses at the crime scene,he
pointed us right back in his direction,

575
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:15,890
and still we didn't see it.

576
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:22,220
So how are you? How
you--how you holding up?

577
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,920
Actually,uh...

578
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:29,820
I'm kind of angry with you.

579
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:32,090
Oh,yeah. 'Cause I gave
your name to the fbi?

580
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,630
Is that--is that
what this is about?

581
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:37,740
No. No,it's not about
what you gave them.

582
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:42,010
It's what I gave you.

583
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:47,390
Why didn't you break the story I gave
you about the deal I made with shaunessy?

584
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,510
- What?
- It was a gift.

585
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,440
I gave it to you.

586
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:01,850
Wait a minute.
Wait--stop.

587
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,940
All you had to do was print the story.

588
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:05,120
No,this
can't--this--

589
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:07,130
I could have just disappeared again.

590
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,530
It's not you,george. There's no way.

591
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,580
Please stop! Stop,george!

592
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:19,540
George,please! This can't be
you. This can't be you. It just...

593
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:20,810
What do you want me to do?

594
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:24,520
I want you to sit down and get it right.

595
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:26,350
Ok.

596
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:35,320
You wrote that I was
either dead or arrested.

597
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:38,920
Well,now u know that's
not what happened.

598
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:43,650
I won. I beat them.

599
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:47,020
And I want everybody to know that.

600
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:52,410
- It's over.
- Stop.

601
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,850
I'll kill him.

602
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,970
You need him to write your story.

603
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:58,570
I'm taking him with me.

604
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:00,010
I'll let him go as soon as I'm safe.

605
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,150
No,you're not.

606
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,720
I said i'll kill him.

607
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:06,370
You kill him,i kill you.

608
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:09,420
You think I'm afraid to die?

609
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:13,450
You're not afraid. You're
greedy and narcissistic.

610
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:16,880
You want the recognition that's going to
come from the book that he's gonna write.

611
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:19,610
You want the fame that's
gonna come from the media.

612
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,250
It's gonna be like bundy.

613
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:23,730
I'm gonna be bigger than bundy.

614
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:27,600
Well,you can't enjoy it if you're dead.

615
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:33,080
If you know me so well,how come
somebody had to die to bring you here?

616
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:36,090
That's your choice,not mine.
You're the serial killer.

617
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:39,170
That's right.

618
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:42,820
Hello,derek.

619
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:51,290
Where's my badge?

620
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,980
Where is it,you son of a bitch?

621
00:39:57,310 --> 00:40:00,860
I'm gonna be more famous
than you even realize.

622
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:03,170
You're dreamin'.

623
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:14,430
- You ok,roy?
- I'm ok. Yeah,I'm ok.

624
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,400
You know...

625
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:27,470
"men heap together the mistakes of their
lives and create a monster they call destiny."

626
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,860
John hobbes.

627
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,560
They didn't find your credentials
at any of the residences.

628
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,880
The blood at the house was foyet's.

629
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:43,950
Reid guessed low. The
coroner said it was 4 quarts.

630
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:46,590
Hotch,how is that
possible? He'd be dead.

631
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:50,120
He's been planning his
death for a long time.

632
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:51,680
So,what,he took a little blood at a time

633
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:55,200
until he had enough to convince us
he was dead without finding his body?

634
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:04,720
Morgan,you're gonna have
to find a way to let it go.

635
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,680
Could you?

636
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:10,240
I'd have to.

637
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:08,380
Foyet escaped.

638
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,450
Guards found him in his cell
vomiting blood and convulsing.

639
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,890
They rushed him to the prison hospital.

640
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,100
Get me the u.s.marshals office.

641
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:20,700
I already called don reilly.
I offered our assistance.

642
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:22,520
He said they'd call
us if they needed it.

643
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:25,670
The boston field office just
identified documents from foyet's house.

644
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,710
They're schematics for the
electrical,heating,And water ducts

645
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,620
for the east woburn
correctional facility.

646
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:30,500
He had the schematics.

647
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:33,760
And not just for woburn. For every
jail,prison,and courthouse in massachusetts.

648
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:36,030
And 10 years to plan.

649
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,960
They're gonna find him,right?

650
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,870
No,they're not.

651
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:47,170
He said he'd be more
famous than we knew.

652
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:50,100
And he was right.
