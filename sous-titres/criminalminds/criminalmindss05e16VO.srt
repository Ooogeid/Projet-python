2
00:00:14,684 --> 00:00:16,111
Are you hungry?

3
00:00:16,332 --> 00:00:17,990
Would you get us something?

4
00:00:18,126 --> 00:00:19,148
You bet.

5
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:20,342
Come on, let's go.

6
00:00:20,384 --> 00:00:21,609
We'll be back.

7
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,642
What's his name?

8
00:00:24,684 --> 00:00:25,733
I don't know.

9
00:00:26,242 --> 00:00:27,819
I'd call him spicy.

10
00:00:29,272 --> 00:00:30,704
What about that one?

11
00:00:31,815 --> 00:00:32,907
Sugar?

12
00:00:33,441 --> 00:00:34,992
Sugar and spice?

13
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:36,040
Spicy.

14
00:00:38,785 --> 00:00:40,206
It's too scratchy.

15
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,057
Itchy. It's itchy.

16
00:00:42,099 --> 00:00:44,462
That's why you're scratching.

17
00:00:44,604 --> 00:00:45,942
Lindsay!

18
00:00:45,984 --> 00:00:48,005
Lindsay! Lindsay!

19
00:00:48,264 --> 00:00:50,925
Lindsay! Has anyone
seen my daughter?

20
00:00:53,372 --> 00:00:55,181
Lindsay! Help!

21
00:00:58,814 --> 00:00:59,885
Aimee.

22
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:12,416
- My god!
- Barbara, what's going on?

23
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:14,919
She was just right here.
She's not here.

24
00:01:15,013 --> 00:01:17,224
- Did she come to you guys?
- No. Where is she?

25
00:01:17,266 --> 00:01:18,870
She was just right here.

26
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,216
Aimee! Aimee!

27
00:01:20,258 --> 00:01:21,904
What do you mean, she's gone?

28
00:01:21,946 --> 00:01:24,224
- Which way did she go?
- I don't know.

29
00:01:24,266 --> 00:01:25,290
Aimee!

30
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:28,693
Mrs. Lynch?

31
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:30,965
We're with the FBI.

32
00:01:31,372 --> 00:01:33,509
Is this the most recent
photo you have of Aimee?

33
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:35,177
Yes.

34
00:01:36,734 --> 00:01:38,968
Aimee Lynch, 8 years old,
was taken an hour ago

35
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:41,512
- from a winter festival in Ashburn.
- Any witnesses?

36
00:01:41,554 --> 00:01:43,911
Her mom Barbara was right next
to her when she vanished.

37
00:01:43,953 --> 00:01:46,730
There must have been hundreds
of people there. No one saw anything?

38
00:01:46,772 --> 00:01:49,029
It's a temporary gathering,
with little to no security.

39
00:01:49,066 --> 00:01:51,216
Reid, you and I are going
to head to the family's house.

40
00:01:51,245 --> 00:01:53,141
The two of you,
I want you to work with Garcia.

41
00:01:53,169 --> 00:01:54,818
We need to look at every local abduction

42
00:01:54,846 --> 00:01:56,931
or attempted one in the past year,
see if there's any overlap.

43
00:01:56,975 --> 00:01:59,009
Good news is that we're
barely into the second hour.

44
00:01:59,046 --> 00:02:02,220
Yeah, odds are we've only got 22 hours
to find Aimee alive, so let's do this.

45
00:02:13,005 --> 00:02:15,593
<i>Aimee Lynch of Ashburn was last
seen at the winter festival</i>

46
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,512
This morning at 10:00.

47
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:20,195
<i>She's 4'8", has blond
hair and green eyes.</i>

48
00:02:20,316 --> 00:02:23,302
<i>With temperatures below
freezing and a chance of snow,</i>

49
00:02:23,344 --> 00:02:24,872
<i>the pressure's on to find her.</i>

50
00:02:24,914 --> 00:02:26,576
Anyone with information about Aimee

51
00:02:26,618 --> 00:02:28,303
Please contact the hotline.

52
00:02:28,345 --> 00:02:29,597
Uh, excuse me.

53
00:02:30,286 --> 00:02:32,128
I'd like to talk to agent Jareau.

54
00:02:32,896 --> 00:02:33,986
Can I help you?

55
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:37,966
Whoever took
Aimee Lynch took my son, too.

56
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,716
Ashburn has a winter
festival every year,

57
00:02:42,758 --> 00:02:44,787
and not a single
attempt at kidnapping.

58
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:47,259
Hey, JJ, there's a woman
here who says her son

59
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:49,076
was abducted by the same offender.

60
00:02:49,612 --> 00:02:50,960
Has she been drinking?

61
00:02:51,002 --> 00:02:53,198
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
How'd you know that?

62
00:02:53,729 --> 00:02:56,523
Sarah Hillridge.
She lost her son Charlie 8 years ago.

63
00:02:56,565 --> 00:02:59,972
She comes in every time a child
around his age goes missing.

64
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:02,374
- She thinks her son is still alive?
- Yeah, I know.

65
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,767
I remember her.
She stays for the first 24 hours, right?

66
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:05,835
Yeah.

67
00:03:06,301 --> 00:03:07,949
There's only 8 hours left.

68
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,384
Any more coffee?

69
00:03:14,426 --> 00:03:16,254
Oh, no, no. I'm fine, thanks.

70
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,033
What's Henry, is he 16 months?

71
00:03:21,188 --> 00:03:22,333
Uh, 17.

72
00:03:24,763 --> 00:03:26,414
Uh, how's your daughter?

73
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,594
Uh, Jake took her away.

74
00:03:30,366 --> 00:03:31,377
What?

75
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,666
Well, he got remarried, and, uh,

76
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:36,382
thought it was best
for Emily to get a fresh start.

77
00:03:38,998 --> 00:03:40,011
Sorry.

78
00:03:40,749 --> 00:03:43,264
Well, I can't really blame him.
I mean, look at me.

79
00:03:43,996 --> 00:03:45,308
Sarah, I really need...

80
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:48,006
This little girl Aimee was 8,
just like Charlie.

81
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,813
They were taken
almost 8 years apart.

82
00:03:51,287 --> 00:03:54,975
Now, I have been doing a lot
of reading about sexual attraction

83
00:03:55,017 --> 00:03:58,575
and know that prepubescence
has the greatest range

84
00:03:58,617 --> 00:04:01,966
and also a really huge
crossover gender-wise.

85
00:04:04,615 --> 00:04:06,162
I'm sorry you know all of that.

86
00:04:06,355 --> 00:04:08,438
I could have gone my whole
life without knowing it,

87
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,250
but then someone took my son.

88
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,866
It's ok.

89
00:04:44,369 --> 00:04:45,746
I'm not gonna hurt you.

90
00:04:46,196 --> 00:04:47,161
Come here.

91
00:04:48,485 --> 00:04:49,901
Come on, come here.

92
00:04:52,143 --> 00:04:53,390
What's your name?

93
00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:56,712
You gotta tell me your name
before they give you a new one.

94
00:04:57,595 --> 00:04:59,382
What are you doing?

95
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,050
What do you think you're doing?

96
00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:04,401
It's not fair.
Let her go!

97
00:05:05,183 --> 00:05:06,789
******

98
00:05:06,831 --> 00:05:09,433
---------

99
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,268
Don't talk to me like that!

100
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,913
You will never talk
to me like that again!

101
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:16,299
Ok. Got it.

102
00:05:16,747 --> 00:05:19,414
Aimee's mom was distracted
by a mother looking for her daughter,

103
00:05:19,456 --> 00:05:21,612
and she's blaming herself
for looking away.

104
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:26,036
Wait. Sarah said the same
thing when Charlie was taken.

105
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,321
There was a mother
searching for her lost son.

106
00:05:29,756 --> 00:05:31,831
Do you...Do you think
it's a coincidence?

107
00:05:32,408 --> 00:05:34,583
Or what?
A ruse?

108
00:05:35,249 --> 00:05:38,303
A woman looking for her lost son...
That's pretty specific, right?

109
00:05:38,345 --> 00:05:41,875
Add to that a target-rich
environment With no security? Yeah.

110
00:05:42,001 --> 00:05:45,182
Ok, so, if the woman was
a distraction, who took Aimee?

111
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,387
A partner?

112
00:05:47,234 --> 00:05:48,983
Well, if it's the same people,

113
00:05:49,025 --> 00:05:51,434
they've been doing this
for close to a decade.

114
00:05:53,126 --> 00:05:54,392
I told you.

115
00:05:59,027 --> 00:06:01,011
* mama's gonna buy you *

116
00:06:01,053 --> 00:06:02,832
* a billy goat *

121
00:07:34,732 --> 00:07:36,032
So that's it, then?

122
00:07:36,074 --> 00:07:38,170
- No, it isn't.
- Well, why are you leaving?

123
00:07:38,212 --> 00:07:40,908
Every available cop in the state
is out looking for your daughter.

124
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,034
Who's been gone
for more than 24 hours.

125
00:07:43,076 --> 00:07:44,869
I think we both know
what that means.

126
00:07:44,911 --> 00:07:47,976
Percentile-wise we do, but every
case is based on its own merit.

127
00:07:48,018 --> 00:07:49,670
Well, what merit is this case?

128
00:07:49,712 --> 00:07:52,721
Sir, Aimee was taken at high
risk by whoever took her.

129
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,998
It means it was organized,
meticulously planned,

130
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,600
and likely more than one person.

131
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,614
This suggests that they intend
on keeping her.

132
00:07:58,656 --> 00:08:00,131
Keeping her?
For what?

133
00:08:00,224 --> 00:08:01,230
Frank?

134
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:07,069
Keeping her means that she's alive,
and I think that's really

135
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,049
all you need to focus on right now.

136
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,116
- Are you leaving?
- Ma'am, our profile remains,

137
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,977
as do hundreds of officers and many
agents looking for your daughter.

138
00:08:15,019 --> 00:08:18,068
Now, if there's any information
pertaining to Aimee, then we'll be back.

139
00:08:22,505 --> 00:08:24,265
Mr. Lynch, I think you should know

140
00:08:24,307 --> 00:08:27,298
that nothing could have stopped
these people from taking your daughter.

141
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,807
Yeah.

142
00:08:29,326 --> 00:08:31,917
I would have never
let go of her hand.

143
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:33,179
Frank, please.

144
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:35,021
Frank.

145
00:08:37,123 --> 00:08:38,493
We've done all we can.

146
00:08:38,535 --> 00:08:40,801
It doesn't make walking
away any easier.

147
00:08:41,293 --> 00:08:42,753
No, it doesn't.

148
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,119
They want to call you Alison.

149
00:08:58,015 --> 00:08:59,682
But that's not my name.

150
00:09:00,276 --> 00:09:01,332
What is it?

151
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,627
I'm not supposed
to talk to strangers.

152
00:09:05,752 --> 00:09:07,175
I'm not a stranger.

153
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,672
I'm your brother.

154
00:09:12,878 --> 00:09:14,618
Why did you bring me here?

155
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:18,535
They call me David.

156
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,450
I want my mommy.

157
00:09:23,841 --> 00:09:25,147
Tell me your name.

158
00:09:26,396 --> 00:09:27,419
Aimee.

159
00:09:30,822 --> 00:09:32,261
Ok, Aimee.

160
00:09:48,801 --> 00:09:50,859
Look, we all think that
aimee could be alive.

161
00:09:50,901 --> 00:09:53,161
No one's given up on her.
That's why there's hundreds

162
00:09:53,203 --> 00:09:55,534
of volunteers and officers
combing every inch of the county.

163
00:09:55,576 --> 00:09:57,900
But they're dragging the rivers
and digging up the woods.

164
00:09:57,942 --> 00:10:00,182
That's not gonna help us
if Aimee is still with the unsub,

165
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:02,633
- if she's still alive out there.
- What about Charlie?

166
00:10:02,865 --> 00:10:03,980
Is he still alive?

167
00:10:04,022 --> 00:10:05,175
Sarah believes it.

168
00:10:05,341 --> 00:10:08,074
8 years she's been saying
the same thing, JJ.

169
00:10:09,926 --> 00:10:12,354
Have you thought about why
you suddenly believe her?

170
00:10:14,096 --> 00:10:16,480
Do you think it might be
because you're a mother?

171
00:10:17,689 --> 00:10:19,386
It's because another woman

172
00:10:19,428 --> 00:10:21,735
just walked in here
with the same exact ruse

173
00:10:21,777 --> 00:10:23,127
used 8 years ago.

174
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:25,968
I can't deny that. Can you?

175
00:10:25,969 --> 00:10:28,204
All I'm saying is,
if we go from a single abduction

176
00:10:28,205 --> 00:10:30,971
To multiple abductions over 10
years, that changes everything.

177
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:33,113
We all have to be convinced
that's what it is,

178
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,341
Based on an unbiased profile.

179
00:10:36,558 --> 00:10:38,437
Ok. Distraction of a lost child.

180
00:10:39,086 --> 00:10:41,463
8-year-old victims taken
from public places

181
00:10:41,633 --> 00:10:44,305
With little to no security.
That's not just the same ruse.

182
00:10:44,565 --> 00:10:45,850
That's a signature.

183
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,219
And I'm not a mother.

184
00:10:47,424 --> 00:10:49,239
Charlie would be 16 now.

185
00:10:49,409 --> 00:10:51,076
We all know that
preferential offenders

186
00:10:51,152 --> 00:10:53,427
Typically dispose of their victims
before they reach puberty.

187
00:10:53,597 --> 00:10:55,398
Maybe he serves another purpose.

188
00:10:55,902 --> 00:10:57,980
Aimee's mom said the
unsub was slight.

189
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,537
It wouldn't be easy to keep
a teenager under her thumb.

190
00:11:00,937 --> 00:11:03,387
Except that she's had him
since he was 8 years old.

191
00:11:03,557 --> 00:11:05,909
By now, he's completely
submissive to her.

192
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,114
Keeping him could explain
why charlie's body was never found.

193
00:11:13,038 --> 00:11:14,921
Go back 10 years nationwide.

194
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:17,481
Start with abductions and
target-rich environments.

195
00:11:17,527 --> 00:11:20,260
Rule out any with bodily recovery,
dead or alive.

196
00:11:20,316 --> 00:11:21,686
I'm gonna let sarah know.

197
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:22,695
Ok.

198
00:11:22,865 --> 00:11:25,737
We need to check out aimee's
abduction site with new eyes.

199
00:11:34,849 --> 00:11:35,848
They're home.

200
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:36,845
Who is?

201
00:11:39,942 --> 00:11:41,779
Do what they say. Ok?

202
00:11:42,882 --> 00:11:44,120
It'll make it easier.

203
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:45,215
David!

204
00:11:45,545 --> 00:11:47,035
What are you doing here?

205
00:11:47,936 --> 00:11:49,386
Taking pictures again?

206
00:11:49,788 --> 00:11:51,487
Now get the hell out of here!

207
00:11:51,657 --> 00:11:52,626
Get out.

208
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:56,533
Well...

209
00:11:58,445 --> 00:12:01,856
Looks like somebody's been sleeping
In goldilocks' bed.

210
00:12:04,188 --> 00:12:06,529
What have we got under here?

211
00:12:06,699 --> 00:12:08,803
Let's take a little look-see.

212
00:12:12,728 --> 00:12:14,938
Well, hello there.

213
00:12:14,939 --> 00:12:15,905
Hoo-ooh!

214
00:12:16,468 --> 00:12:17,874
I just want to go home.

215
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:21,776
Ohh... You are home, alison.

216
00:12:29,313 --> 00:12:30,280
Now the traffic.

217
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:33,092
A 3-car pileup on the 66
Has traffic backed up both ways.

218
00:12:33,121 --> 00:12:35,215
Police are asking drivers
to find alternate routes.

219
00:12:35,216 --> 00:12:36,249
Sarah?

220
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,350
Back to you, jane.

221
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,640
Thanks, bill.

222
00:12:38,687 --> 00:12:40,767
Aimee lynch was last seen
wearing a winter coat...

223
00:12:40,832 --> 00:12:41,950
Sarah, it's jennifer.

224
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,997
She was with her family
at the winter festival in ashburn.

225
00:12:45,073 --> 00:12:47,021
The family has not put
out a statement yet,

226
00:12:47,094 --> 00:12:49,385
As the authorities are
handling the case.

227
00:12:49,534 --> 00:12:52,372
Anyone with information about aimee
Please contact the hotline.

228
00:12:52,953 --> 00:12:53,893
Sarah?

229
00:13:09,449 --> 00:13:10,973
Not hard to profile, is it?

230
00:13:12,936 --> 00:13:14,173
You think I'm insane?

231
00:13:17,499 --> 00:13:18,131
No.

232
00:13:20,236 --> 00:13:21,345
What do you think?

233
00:13:22,182 --> 00:13:24,006
I think the same thing you do.

234
00:13:26,637 --> 00:13:27,995
What do you mean?

235
00:13:29,871 --> 00:13:34,141
I think the same people that took
aimee took charlie.

236
00:13:40,565 --> 00:13:42,225
I want to show you something.

237
00:13:43,535 --> 00:13:46,285
Since 2000, over 200 children's
bodies have not been found.

238
00:13:46,455 --> 00:13:47,999
Nationwide. What about virginia?

239
00:13:48,169 --> 00:13:50,400
Of the missing and presumed dead,
there are 12.

240
00:13:50,504 --> 00:13:53,368
Uh, charlie's been on the list
for 8 years, Aimee just joined it.

241
00:13:53,501 --> 00:13:55,473
So aimee was taken from ashburn,

242
00:13:55,643 --> 00:13:58,564
Charlie from leesburg, 8 years ago,

243
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:00,644
Both within a half
mile of the highway.

244
00:14:00,724 --> 00:14:02,010
What about the others?

245
00:14:02,073 --> 00:14:04,314
Karla hartway was abducted in 1999,

246
00:14:04,348 --> 00:14:05,916
Age 8, from garrisonville.

247
00:14:06,361 --> 00:14:08,986
Stephen shepherd, abducted 2003,
also 8, from arlington.

248
00:14:08,987 --> 00:14:10,120
Danny kenman...

249
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:13,004
Abducted June 12 at 4:
00 from the mall.

250
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,447
Parents divorced.
He's still missing.

251
00:14:15,733 --> 00:14:17,059
What do the flowers mean?

252
00:14:17,728 --> 00:14:19,594
They were all found dead.

253
00:14:20,372 --> 00:14:22,360
But all the rest are still missing.

254
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,717
Like tracey cain, 9,

255
00:14:24,887 --> 00:14:27,430
She vanished from a park,
both parents present.

256
00:14:27,515 --> 00:14:31,388
And then jake wusman, abducted
September 29, from rock creek park.

257
00:14:31,657 --> 00:14:34,189
He was with his entire family.
They were on a picnic.

258
00:14:34,284 --> 00:14:35,809
And then there's--
Sarah.

259
00:14:39,918 --> 00:14:41,442
If you're gonna help us,

260
00:14:42,023 --> 00:14:43,648
I need you to do something for me.

261
00:14:44,052 --> 00:14:45,323
Anything.

262
00:14:45,947 --> 00:14:47,782
Stop drinking.

263
00:14:49,661 --> 00:14:51,618
I can do that. I can do that.

264
00:14:56,222 --> 00:14:57,990
Shouldn't we bring
barbara back here?

265
00:14:58,638 --> 00:15:01,557
No, she's given us all she can.
Let's go through it.

266
00:15:01,727 --> 00:15:04,362
Ok. She was standing
about here, right?

267
00:15:04,768 --> 00:15:06,630
It's crowded. Families all around.

268
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:09,064
Are you hungry?

269
00:15:10,191 --> 00:15:11,631
Come on. Let's get something.

270
00:15:12,128 --> 00:15:14,873
The unsubs are watching and
waiting for the best target.

271
00:15:15,893 --> 00:15:17,807
I want to ride the spotted one.

272
00:15:20,112 --> 00:15:21,576
Itchy scratchy.

273
00:15:21,939 --> 00:15:23,303
Then she hears it.

274
00:15:23,354 --> 00:15:25,872
Lindsay! Lindsay!

275
00:15:26,614 --> 00:15:29,249
Lindsay! Has anyone
seen my daughter?!

276
00:15:30,394 --> 00:15:33,390
By the time she turns around,
aimee's gone.

277
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,473
The mother who just
cried wolf moves off.

278
00:15:36,546 --> 00:15:38,762
She can hear barbara crying
out for aimee, but...

279
00:15:38,817 --> 00:15:42,403
Aimee can't answer because the unsub
has her face buried in his chest.

280
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:47,060
To passersby, it looked like
any parent carrying a crying child.

281
00:15:48,576 --> 00:15:50,041
30 seconds later,

282
00:15:50,475 --> 00:15:52,328
She's concealed in the vehicle...

283
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,027
And they're gone.

284
00:15:55,119 --> 00:15:58,031
The same one rolls up on
our mother, she gets in, it's done.

285
00:15:58,403 --> 00:15:59,969
Who's driving it?

286
00:16:04,769 --> 00:16:06,418
It took 3 unsubs to pull this off.

287
00:16:06,488 --> 00:16:08,925
If the same people took charlie,
We're looking for a group.

288
00:16:08,996 --> 00:16:10,836
Well, if they've taken
2 or more children

289
00:16:10,892 --> 00:16:13,468
Over an 8-year period,
somebody must have noticed something.

290
00:16:13,511 --> 00:16:15,179
How do they keep
the victims hidden?

291
00:16:15,255 --> 00:16:17,102
Once we figure that out,
we'll find them.

292
00:16:17,147 --> 00:16:18,093
The unsubs?

293
00:16:19,162 --> 00:16:20,470
And the children.

294
00:16:58,386 --> 00:17:00,115
Beautiful, aren't they?

295
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:01,829
Thank you.

296
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:04,519
I planted each and every
one of them myself.

297
00:17:04,628 --> 00:17:06,220
I like to think of these roses

298
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:08,990
As the souls of the forgotten.

299
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,730
Like...This poor young man here.

300
00:17:29,095 --> 00:17:30,798
Hotch, uh, this is sarah hillridge.

301
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:33,505
Oh, we met when charlie was taken.

302
00:17:33,675 --> 00:17:35,723
I mean, you know,
you saw a lot of us.

303
00:17:35,724 --> 00:17:37,358
I'm sure we all look the same.

304
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:39,760
Thank you for coming in.
Have a seat.

305
00:17:40,758 --> 00:17:44,404
All right, these represent kids
taken from public places.

306
00:17:44,574 --> 00:17:47,996
Locations are never hit more than
once, but there is similarity in each

307
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:52,191
Different malls, toy stores,
Carnivals, theme parks, parades.

308
00:17:52,451 --> 00:17:54,608
Places where families
should feel safe.

309
00:17:54,778 --> 00:17:56,476
And where there
isn't much security.

310
00:17:56,646 --> 00:17:58,511
That's 12 children over 10 years?

311
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,891
We should interview
all the families.

312
00:18:00,948 --> 00:18:02,206
I know a few of them.

313
00:18:02,259 --> 00:18:05,183
We had a support group.
I mean, most of them have moved on.

314
00:18:05,956 --> 00:18:07,321
But you're here.

315
00:18:10,351 --> 00:18:12,294
I saw charlie 3 years ago.

316
00:18:16,351 --> 00:18:17,696
You didn't tell me that.

317
00:18:18,102 --> 00:18:20,662
Well, my husband didn't believe me.
Why would you?

318
00:18:21,647 --> 00:18:23,229
Tell us what happened.

319
00:18:23,273 --> 00:18:24,930
At first, I saw him all the time.

320
00:18:24,986 --> 00:18:28,162
I thought I did, and from
what I understand, that's normal.

321
00:18:29,338 --> 00:18:31,200
But you can't survive that way.

322
00:18:31,522 --> 00:18:34,302
So jake and I promised
that we would move on.

323
00:18:34,956 --> 00:18:36,871
But a few years later, I saw him.

324
00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:39,433
I mean, it was different. I mean,
in my mind, he had never aged,

325
00:18:39,498 --> 00:18:41,903
But this was a teenage
charlie crossing the street.

326
00:18:41,984 --> 00:18:44,898
And as quick as he was there he was
gone again, but I know I saw him.

327
00:18:45,773 --> 00:18:47,416
Jake didn't believe me.

328
00:18:49,311 --> 00:18:50,860
That was the day he left me.

329
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:53,385
What did you do when
you saw charlie?

330
00:18:54,455 --> 00:18:55,752
I called for him.

331
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,481
Charlie!
How did you know it was him?

332
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:06,178
Well, I didn't, not for sure,
so I called for him again.

333
00:19:06,243 --> 00:19:07,492
**************

334
00:19:07,576 --> 00:19:08,754
Did he hear you?

335
00:19:08,924 --> 00:19:10,013
He looked back.

336
00:19:10,077 --> 00:19:11,524
And your husband didn't see him?

337
00:19:11,581 --> 00:19:12,576
*********

338
00:19:12,803 --> 00:19:14,981
It was crowded.
He disappeared.

339
00:19:15,075 --> 00:19:16,993
I lost him all over again.

340
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:22,222
We'll be asking those parents to
sign up for all that pain again.

341
00:19:23,116 --> 00:19:24,595
If they've moved on...

342
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:27,787
They'd take the chance if it
meant their kids were alive.

343
00:19:43,967 --> 00:19:47,190
Just flare up that hair
a little bit more,

344
00:19:47,315 --> 00:19:49,431
and it went farther down his neck.

345
00:19:50,266 --> 00:19:52,649
His eyebrows are not quite as

346
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:53,608
full.

347
00:19:56,054 --> 00:19:57,996
Stephen's been missing 7 years?

348
00:19:58,121 --> 00:19:59,182
In february.

349
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,482
He'd be 15 now.

350
00:20:01,892 --> 00:20:04,232
And you last saw him
in the toy section?

351
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,081
That sar hillridge?

352
00:20:09,256 --> 00:20:11,468
- Do you know her?
- We were friends.

353
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:14,023
We were in a support group together.

354
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:16,840
Stephen was taken the year after
charlie. You know she's crazy?

355
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:18,174
Leave her alone.

356
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,217
She is.

357
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,239
No, sir, I don't know that.

358
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,926
Wishing for your boy to
come home is one thing.

359
00:20:24,051 --> 00:20:26,009
She threw her whole life away.

360
00:20:26,328 --> 00:20:29,944
Her husband's a good man, and she's
got a daughter who she can't even.

361
00:20:30,576 --> 00:20:32,272
Why would she ruin that?

362
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,326
Hope can be paralyzing, sir.

363
00:20:35,703 --> 00:20:37,110
We believe that the people

364
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:39,863
who took aimee lynch Have been
doing this for a very long time.

365
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,474
The little girl yesterday?

366
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,961
In the moments before your son
was taken, did anything stand out?

367
00:20:46,557 --> 00:20:47,495
Like what?

368
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:50,411
Anything at all that drew
your attention away from him?

369
00:20:52,563 --> 00:20:54,419
Just for a moment, but I never

370
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:57,362
- thought anything about it. That woman.
- Looking for her son.

371
00:20:57,452 --> 00:20:58,756
I helped her.

372
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:01,634
Oh, god.

373
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,751
- She even thanked me for helping.
- You couldn't have known.

374
00:21:05,804 --> 00:21:08,386
She was right in front of me.
How could she have taken stephen?

375
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,433
Because she's not working alone.

376
00:21:10,512 --> 00:21:13,514
They've used this ruse in
a dozen local abductions.

377
00:21:15,331 --> 00:21:17,065
Is that why we're here?

378
00:21:20,356 --> 00:21:22,456
They've done this to all of us?

379
00:21:23,019 --> 00:21:25,632
Do you think there's
a chance Stephen's still alive?

380
00:21:38,551 --> 00:21:40,100
How many are there?

381
00:21:40,344 --> 00:21:41,981
You're the fourth.

382
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,093
But there have been others.

383
00:21:44,641 --> 00:21:45,803
Where are they?

384
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,489
Someplace better.

385
00:21:49,563 --> 00:21:51,580
They're gonna get us for supper.

386
00:21:52,152 --> 00:21:53,811
But I'm not hungry.

387
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:57,038
What's your favorite food?

388
00:21:57,813 --> 00:21:58,937
Ice cream?

389
00:22:01,671 --> 00:22:04,378
Pretend it's ice cream
And eat it all up.

390
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:05,949
OK?

391
00:22:06,511 --> 00:22:07,777
I want my mommy.

392
00:22:25,326 --> 00:22:26,756
You're in good hands.

393
00:22:27,201 --> 00:22:29,221
There's no one better than them.

394
00:22:30,108 --> 00:22:30,987
I know.

395
00:22:37,048 --> 00:22:38,677
I let go of her hand.

396
00:22:42,422 --> 00:22:44,079
It was only for a second,

397
00:22:44,204 --> 00:22:47,156
but she's always been
the one that I worried about.

398
00:22:47,723 --> 00:22:50,159
- You can't blame yourself.
- Frank does.

399
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:53,272
And he's right.
I should have held on.

400
00:22:56,898 --> 00:22:59,089
Aimee's wandered off before, and...

401
00:23:00,672 --> 00:23:02,340
There's this feeling

402
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:04,553
when they're out of your sight.

403
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,120
It takes your breath away
until you see them again.

404
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:12,849
And I think that's
why I can't breathe.

405
00:23:18,075 --> 00:23:21,405
11 families have confirmed
the same woman, 40 to 50 years old,

406
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:24,515
calling for children. In some cases,
she even had a child with her.

407
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,965
She actually used
the kids for the abductions?

408
00:23:27,089 --> 00:23:29,309
Were they her own
or the ones kidnapped?

409
00:23:29,397 --> 00:23:31,335
We don't believe she's a mother.

410
00:23:31,424 --> 00:23:34,328
Most predisposed female
offenders are not.

411
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,620
But they are the most violent.

412
00:23:38,762 --> 00:23:41,290
You said that she's
working with someone?

413
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:43,379
It's likely a subservient male.

414
00:23:43,434 --> 00:23:46,053
But the woman separates
herself from her partners.

415
00:23:46,141 --> 00:23:48,461
She chooses the victim while
they do the riskiest part.

416
00:23:48,586 --> 00:23:50,829
They grab the child
and manage the getaway.

417
00:23:50,945 --> 00:23:53,347
This is what he looks
like as a teenager.

418
00:23:54,126 --> 00:23:56,934
He's tall and thin.
His hair is...

419
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,666
darker than it was.

420
00:23:59,172 --> 00:24:00,601
But that's him.

421
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,356
That's Charlie.

422
00:24:04,505 --> 00:24:07,025
Why would they take the risk of
letting him out in the world?

423
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:09,298
They've had him under
their control for 8 years.

424
00:24:09,423 --> 00:24:12,077
He's either got Stockholm
or he's being threatened.

425
00:24:12,193 --> 00:24:13,990
"Get us another kid,

426
00:24:14,854 --> 00:24:16,412
and we won't kill you."

427
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:18,921
Sarah...

428
00:24:19,308 --> 00:24:21,042
Let's take a break, OK?

429
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,200
Thank you. Thank you.

430
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:30,626
All right.

431
00:24:30,942 --> 00:24:33,544
So living and working
in Northern Virginia.

432
00:24:34,877 --> 00:24:36,412
It's most likely in isolation.

433
00:24:36,535 --> 00:24:38,337
I mean, there's no way
to explain a houseful

434
00:24:38,384 --> 00:24:40,084
of kids At the neighborhood block party.

435
00:24:40,174 --> 00:24:42,166
Managing this many
children isn't easy.

436
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:44,814
There have to be incidents where
things didn't go as planned.

437
00:24:44,939 --> 00:24:47,088
We should start with domestic
calls and disturbances.

438
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,654
Concentrate on families
who were visited by social services.

439
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,001
I'll get Garcia.

440
00:24:52,515 --> 00:24:54,889
It's likely these unsubs
were questioned before.

441
00:24:55,124 --> 00:24:57,913
Once we narrow down Garcia's list,
we should revisit them.

442
00:24:58,944 --> 00:25:01,332
What they've been doing to
Charlie this whole time,

443
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,829
here were times
that I had hoped he was dead

444
00:25:03,954 --> 00:25:06,326
just so he wouldn't
suffer every day.

445
00:25:07,675 --> 00:25:10,640
We know these offenders are
skilled at abductions and

446
00:25:10,732 --> 00:25:12,280
hiding their victims.

447
00:25:12,405 --> 00:25:15,847
Usually,
we don't know that until after the fact.

448
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:17,585
What you've brought us,

449
00:25:17,831 --> 00:25:18,851
to them,

450
00:25:19,436 --> 00:25:20,469
is rare.

451
00:25:21,124 --> 00:25:23,938
I know, but it's not gonna
end well for all of us.

452
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:28,100
I recognize him. He was there.

453
00:25:28,225 --> 00:25:29,425
When we were in line.

454
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:31,737
He was too old for the ponies.
I should have known that.

455
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:34,031
- He was a few people behind us.
- You saw him, too.

456
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:37,118
- He seemed like a normal kid.
- He's still alive.

457
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:39,328
Wait, this is your son?

458
00:25:39,929 --> 00:25:40,808
Charlie.

459
00:25:41,312 --> 00:25:43,124
Your son took my baby?

460
00:25:43,249 --> 00:25:44,125
Mrs. Lynch.

461
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:46,218
- Your son took Aimee?
- Honey, come on.

462
00:25:46,343 --> 00:25:47,712
He's one of them.

463
00:25:47,848 --> 00:25:49,757
He's taking innocent children.

464
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:52,581
Aimee is 8 years old.
She can't defend herself.

465
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:55,011
And he knew that!
He watched her!

466
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:57,116
He's as bad as the rest of them.

467
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,126
She's right.

468
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:05,193
No. Charlie didn't have a choice.

469
00:26:05,277 --> 00:26:07,740
He's one of them now.
How is he ever going to forgethat?

470
00:26:07,806 --> 00:26:09,734
He's just trying to survive.

471
00:26:13,349 --> 00:26:13,998
OK.

472
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:16,079
My god.

473
00:26:23,697 --> 00:26:25,209
Please stay with me.

474
00:26:25,596 --> 00:26:27,015
She'll check on you.

475
00:26:27,236 --> 00:26:28,186
Please.

476
00:26:30,154 --> 00:26:31,455
Just for a minute.

477
00:26:44,606 --> 00:26:45,368
Hey.

478
00:26:46,751 --> 00:26:48,147
Who let you in here?

479
00:26:48,637 --> 00:26:50,633
Please, take me. Don't hurt her.

480
00:26:58,223 --> 00:26:59,867
Please don't leave me.

481
00:27:34,313 --> 00:27:37,454
OK, there are 107 families
visited by social services

482
00:27:37,579 --> 00:27:38,837
in the last 10 years.

483
00:27:38,962 --> 00:27:41,830
That's too many to go door to door.
We're gonna have to narrow that down.

484
00:27:41,896 --> 00:27:44,328
We need to figure out why they're
staying In Northern Virginia.

485
00:27:44,365 --> 00:27:45,749
Their work could be the key.

486
00:27:45,874 --> 00:27:48,724
They could have a child-care
facility on the premises as a cover.

487
00:27:48,818 --> 00:27:50,871
You know, it's most likely
a single income family.

488
00:27:50,905 --> 00:27:52,778
Someone has to be home
to stay with the kids.

489
00:27:52,825 --> 00:27:54,308
OK, all this helps.

490
00:27:54,351 --> 00:27:57,174
They've been questioned before,
So we can expect a rehearsed response.

491
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,241
How many on that list
are single income?

492
00:27:59,366 --> 00:28:00,052
23.

493
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:02,847
What's the problem?

494
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:04,991
We're gonna be knocking on
the doors of 23 families

495
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:07,495
and all of them have done
something bad to a kid.

496
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,319
We don't have a warrant.
Just our profile.

497
00:28:10,765 --> 00:28:12,493
If we get it wrong and leave that house,

498
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:15,548
they'll destroy any evidence they have,
including the children.

499
00:28:19,402 --> 00:28:21,680
Jj, get an article
of aimee's clothing.

500
00:28:23,199 --> 00:28:24,171
What for?

501
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:28,121
It's for the dogs.

502
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:36,729
- Leave it alone.
- No, I can't.

503
00:28:36,854 --> 00:28:38,024
Yes, you can.

504
00:28:41,959 --> 00:28:42,887
8 years?

505
00:28:45,322 --> 00:28:46,677
There's a moment

506
00:28:46,752 --> 00:28:48,908
In the morning, just as I wake up...

507
00:28:50,373 --> 00:28:52,829
Where there's
a split-second of peace.

508
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:56,215
And then, it all comes back.

509
00:28:56,455 --> 00:28:57,416
All of it.

510
00:29:00,477 --> 00:29:02,623
Yeah. I haven't slept yet.

511
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,404
I hope you get her back
before you need to.

512
00:29:09,028 --> 00:29:09,790
If...

513
00:29:10,235 --> 00:29:13,918
you didn't believe for all those
years that your son was still alive,

514
00:29:14,129 --> 00:29:15,966
None of us would be here now.

515
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:18,478
I would have felt if he was gone.

516
00:29:22,517 --> 00:29:24,804
I need an item of Aimee's clothing.

517
00:29:25,412 --> 00:29:26,087
Why?

518
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:30,684
She never put it back on.

519
00:29:32,478 --> 00:29:33,594
Thank you.

520
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:43,874
Mr. Jenkins, we're with the FBI.

521
00:29:44,613 --> 00:29:46,687
We'd like to ask you
a few questions.

522
00:29:49,107 --> 00:29:52,025
We're going door to door.
You must be our what do you think?

523
00:29:52,076 --> 00:29:53,960
40th, 50th door, I don't know.

524
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,928
Do you mind if we come in?

525
00:29:57,347 --> 00:29:59,965
Mr. Hayden, how many
children do you have?

526
00:30:03,171 --> 00:30:04,201
One on the way.

527
00:30:04,252 --> 00:30:06,103
And where are they now?

528
00:30:10,172 --> 00:30:11,250
Mr. Hayden.

529
00:30:12,733 --> 00:30:13,943
I'm sorry?

530
00:30:13,994 --> 00:30:16,145
I said, you've got
a lot of land here.

531
00:30:18,532 --> 00:30:20,015
And a houseful of kids.

532
00:30:20,066 --> 00:30:21,387
Yes, I do.

533
00:30:25,762 --> 00:30:27,321
It's awfully quiet.

534
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:28,896
Are they out?

535
00:30:28,926 --> 00:30:30,323
My wife took them out.

536
00:30:30,374 --> 00:30:32,025
At the winter festival?

537
00:30:32,336 --> 00:30:33,793
Winter festival?

538
00:30:35,545 --> 00:30:36,951
In ashburn.

539
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:40,946
No. But that's
a wonderful idea.

540
00:30:40,995 --> 00:30:42,433
I'll mention that to my wife.

541
00:30:42,484 --> 00:30:44,067
Might be nice for the kids.

542
00:30:44,118 --> 00:30:45,669
They have pony rides.

543
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,818
Oh, great.

544
00:30:48,655 --> 00:30:51,940
So, uh, do the kids
take after your wife?

545
00:30:51,991 --> 00:30:53,441
Some say they do.

546
00:30:55,522 --> 00:30:56,833
How can I help you?

547
00:30:57,003 --> 00:30:59,179
Oh, we were actually hoping
that your wife would be here.

548
00:30:59,417 --> 00:31:00,880
Do you know when she'll be back?

549
00:31:00,931 --> 00:31:02,770
She's got the kids
out on a field trip.

550
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,857
Shh. If you make a sound,

551
00:31:06,807 --> 00:31:08,486
I'll kill your mommy.

552
00:31:09,705 --> 00:31:11,188
Do you understand me?

553
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,257
Come over here.

554
00:31:18,444 --> 00:31:20,130
Clean out your room.

555
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:21,599
Now.

556
00:31:32,659 --> 00:31:35,143
Uh, I can get her back here.

557
00:31:35,194 --> 00:31:37,209
Please. If you don't mind.

558
00:31:38,376 --> 00:31:40,282
I need to step outside.

559
00:31:40,333 --> 00:31:41,483
Excuse me.

560
00:31:47,812 --> 00:31:49,856
Why don't you go on ahead and, uh,

561
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:51,943
Make that phone call.

562
00:31:57,293 --> 00:31:58,721
- Hotch?
- What have you got?

563
00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:01,300
We are at 2150 mosley lane.

564
00:32:01,351 --> 00:32:04,103
Only the husband is here.
Roger roycewood.

565
00:32:04,154 --> 00:32:05,104
Wife and kids?

566
00:32:05,155 --> 00:32:06,204
Yeah. Out.

567
00:32:06,255 --> 00:32:08,172
He matches the profile?

568
00:32:08,223 --> 00:32:09,507
So does the property.

569
00:32:09,558 --> 00:32:11,742
It's isolated. You can't
see it from the street.

570
00:32:11,793 --> 00:32:14,044
They have extra locks on the doors.

571
00:32:14,095 --> 00:32:15,945
There's a minivan in the driveway

572
00:32:15,996 --> 00:32:19,048
And a photo of a boy who
looks a lot like charlie.

573
00:32:19,099 --> 00:32:20,415
Is he onto you?

574
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:23,205
- Without a doubt.
- We're on our way.

575
00:32:23,289 --> 00:32:24,696
- Search warrant?
- And dogs.

576
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,120
If the kids are
anywhere near

577
00:32:26,175 --> 00:32:27,853
Or in the house, we'll find them.

578
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:31,595
Uh, voicemail again.

579
00:32:33,749 --> 00:32:36,267
I suppose y'all could
come back later.

580
00:32:36,726 --> 00:32:39,569
I think we both know
that's not gonna happen.

581
00:32:49,642 --> 00:32:51,778
Ok, let's go. Shh. Keep quiet.

582
00:32:53,397 --> 00:32:55,891
Where's stephen? She took him away.

583
00:32:56,144 --> 00:32:58,517
Is that because he wouldn't
go to the carnival?

584
00:32:59,113 --> 00:33:01,251
I said you'd see him. Get in there.

585
00:33:43,603 --> 00:33:46,520
How far do you want this
tape to go around the back?

586
00:33:48,705 --> 00:33:51,313
I guess you got your warrant.

587
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:54,491
And ground-penetrating radar.

588
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:57,697
We will find where you buried them.

589
00:33:58,618 --> 00:34:00,538
Will that hurt the roses?

590
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,107
The radar?

591
00:34:08,134 --> 00:34:09,253
Officer.

592
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:23,869
Security camera on the front door.

593
00:34:30,894 --> 00:34:31,880
What?

594
00:34:32,776 --> 00:34:34,113
It's a hinge.

595
00:34:43,727 --> 00:34:46,089
Let's get the dogs down here.

596
00:34:49,009 --> 00:34:50,493
Give me that sack.

597
00:34:57,387 --> 00:34:59,059
What is this place?

598
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:00,908
I don't know.

599
00:35:10,413 --> 00:35:11,957
What's that?

600
00:35:29,847 --> 00:35:31,730
Is that aimee lynch?

601
00:35:32,574 --> 00:35:33,733
They dyed her hair.

602
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:40,742
There's none of charlie.

603
00:35:41,694 --> 00:35:43,745
He probably took these pictures.

604
00:35:43,796 --> 00:35:45,147
For what?

605
00:35:47,738 --> 00:35:48,530
Proof.

606
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:52,888
What about their work?
We thought it could be tied

607
00:35:52,926 --> 00:35:54,255
To what they do for a living.

608
00:35:54,306 --> 00:35:56,528
Employment records,
taxes, it's all legit.

609
00:35:56,579 --> 00:35:58,531
Roger's an electrician,
has been since forever.

610
00:35:58,582 --> 00:35:59,717
What about the wife?

611
00:35:59,768 --> 00:36:01,313
Looks like she stays at home.

612
00:36:01,364 --> 00:36:03,502
I'm crossing these same
records with her maiden name,

613
00:36:03,553 --> 00:36:06,138
Anita weld roycewood.
I don't think I'm gonna find anything.

614
00:36:06,189 --> 00:36:08,240
And I'm rarely wrong, so

615
00:36:08,818 --> 00:36:09,644
I'm wrong.

616
00:36:09,701 --> 00:36:11,475
Her family owns a funeral
home in leesburg.

617
00:36:11,504 --> 00:36:13,128
You're less than
10 minutes from it.

618
00:36:13,156 --> 00:36:16,218
Oh, god. The funeral home's been in the
weld family Since she was a little girl.

619
00:36:16,332 --> 00:36:19,118
Hearses, coffins, vans,
a million ways to hide the children.

620
00:36:19,169 --> 00:36:20,738
We can't dig up 10
years of coffins.

621
00:36:20,789 --> 00:36:21,920
You might not have to.

622
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,554
They have a crematorium.

623
00:36:45,763 --> 00:36:47,447
What are we doing here?

624
00:36:47,498 --> 00:36:49,449
What's happening?

625
00:36:52,937 --> 00:36:54,821
Put her in there.

626
00:36:56,071 --> 00:36:58,792
Put her in there!

627
00:37:26,502 --> 00:37:27,919
Shut her up.

628
00:37:28,345 --> 00:37:30,356
Did you hear me?

629
00:37:36,813 --> 00:37:38,530
Come here. Come here.

630
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,130
Come on.

631
00:37:40,443 --> 00:37:41,915
Come on over here, now.

632
00:37:42,219 --> 00:37:43,734
Just be mama's big girl, ok?

633
00:37:44,786 --> 00:37:45,737
It's all right.

634
00:37:47,992 --> 00:37:50,010
Come here. Come on.

635
00:37:50,895 --> 00:37:52,512
Let her go!

636
00:37:57,603 --> 00:37:59,853
come on, you gotta be kidding

637
00:38:16,435 --> 00:38:19,472
She can't hurt us anymore.

638
00:38:31,401 --> 00:38:33,752
All right. Thanks.

639
00:38:33,803 --> 00:38:35,721
They found the kids.

640
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:37,523
Time to arrest roger roycewood.

641
00:38:37,574 --> 00:38:38,958
Who gets the honors?

642
00:38:39,009 --> 00:38:40,723
Where is he? In the bathroom.

643
00:38:58,096 --> 00:38:59,413
How are you doing?

644
00:38:59,464 --> 00:39:01,114
Honestly, I'm terrified.

645
00:39:01,284 --> 00:39:02,809
I've waited 8 years.

646
00:39:02,864 --> 00:39:04,184
What if he doesn't know me?

647
00:39:04,235 --> 00:39:06,253
How long have you been
doing this, dr. Reid?

648
00:39:06,304 --> 00:39:08,756
5 years, 7 months, and 19 days.

649
00:39:08,807 --> 00:39:11,092
In your experience,
what normally happens?

650
00:39:11,143 --> 00:39:13,439
Charlie was 8 when he was taken,

651
00:39:13,515 --> 00:39:15,810
Which means developmentally,
he was in middle childhood.

652
00:39:15,857 --> 00:39:17,663
He had a stronger sense
of right and wrong

653
00:39:17,714 --> 00:39:19,898
And a growing understanding
of his place in the world.

654
00:39:19,949 --> 00:39:23,306
Mentally, he had the ability to talk
about his thoughts and feelings,

655
00:39:23,398 --> 00:39:26,837
While have less focus on himself
and more concern for others.

656
00:39:27,543 --> 00:39:30,006
So you think he's gonna be ok?

657
00:39:30,057 --> 00:39:33,075
With a mother like
you who did all this,

658
00:39:33,126 --> 00:39:34,077
I do.

659
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:37,512
I'm a doctor.
I put my faith in facts

660
00:39:37,563 --> 00:39:39,423
And statistical probabilities,

661
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:40,948
But today,

662
00:39:40,999 --> 00:39:43,417
8 parents are gonna have closure.

663
00:39:43,468 --> 00:39:46,353
3 children are going
home with their families,

664
00:39:46,913 --> 00:39:49,857
All because you believed
your son was alive.

665
00:39:51,142 --> 00:39:53,961
That's as close to a
miracle as I've ever seen.

666
00:39:55,783 --> 00:39:57,231
Thank you.

667
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:06,890
We heard they're on their way back,

668
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:09,075
But we don't know if
stephen's with them.

669
00:40:09,126 --> 00:40:09,999
ohh...

670
00:40:14,399 --> 00:40:15,350
Jake.

671
00:40:15,401 --> 00:40:17,451
Thanks for calling.

672
00:40:17,502 --> 00:40:20,286
You, uh, need to thank her.

673
00:40:24,873 --> 00:40:26,658
You look so happy.

674
00:40:27,876 --> 00:40:29,382
You found him.

675
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,362
You did it.

676
00:40:49,063 --> 00:40:50,471
Charlie?

677
00:40:51,273 --> 00:40:51,969
Mom.

678
00:40:54,235 --> 00:40:55,416
Charlie.

679
00:41:43,814 --> 00:41:45,666
I knew stephen.

680
00:41:47,073 --> 00:41:49,269
He was like a brother to me.

681
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,871
Did he remember us?

682
00:41:51,321 --> 00:41:53,307
You didn't doubt that, did you?

683
00:41:53,358 --> 00:41:55,942
Remembering you was the
only way we survived.

684
00:41:56,371 --> 00:41:58,153
How old was stephen when

685
00:41:59,931 --> 00:42:01,882
When he died?

686
00:42:01,933 --> 00:42:05,084
He died protecting
that little girl.

687
00:42:05,135 --> 00:42:06,882
Oh, god.

688
00:42:10,872 --> 00:42:14,092
He was alive yesterday?

689
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:36,001
I have been trying to
think of something to say,

690
00:42:36,171 --> 00:42:38,980
And thank you just
doesn't even come close.

691
00:42:39,031 --> 00:42:40,515
You don't have to thank us.

692
00:42:40,566 --> 00:42:41,549
Yes, I do.

693
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,109
Do you know how long it's been

694
00:42:43,279 --> 00:42:44,751
Since someone believed in me?

695
00:42:47,771 --> 00:42:50,789
You are just
surrounded by darkness.

696
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,424
Why do you do it?

697
00:42:55,944 --> 00:42:57,761
Because of days like this.
