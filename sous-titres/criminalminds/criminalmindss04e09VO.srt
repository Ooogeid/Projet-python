2
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:34,600
- I feel stupid.
- You look amazing. Drink.

3
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,940
- I'm going home.
- No. Come on. It's just an off night.

4
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,540
At any moment, Mr. Right is
going twalk through that...

5
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:54,140
Oh, my...

6
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,390
- Is he cute?
- Better.

7
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,220
Have a drink.

8
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,860
Vanessa Holden, age 25.

9
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,620
Last friday night, she
was clubng with her sister.

10
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:21,030
A stranger, white male,
roughly her age, picked her up.

11
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,920
They left the club at 1
A.M, went back to her place.

12
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,750
He forced her on her hands and knees.

13
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,450
And then he cut her open
just below the stomach.

14
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,460
Yeah. Pretty rough.

15
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,830
The gutting causes the
intestines to spill out.

16
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,920
You can survive for a few
hours, actually even days.

17
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,940
Postmortem indicates that
he slit her throat at 5 A.M.

18
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,510
So he disemboweled her but
didn't kill her for 4 hours.

19
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:46,690
He could be a sexual sadist.

20
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,690
Yeah, i thought so, too, but i
found two priors from a year ago--

21
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,920
Prostitutes, actually, in motel rooms.

22
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,340
Ok. So keep running with it.

23
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:57,190
Why do you think this is the same unsub?

24
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,130
In Vanessa Holden's apartment,
the following were discover--

25
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:04,870
bleach, ammonia, trash bags--
all in a triangular pattern.

26
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:09,740
One year ago, motel rooms--
bleach, ammonia, trash bags--

27
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,830
Also in a triangular pattern.

28
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,650
He's cleaning up.

29
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,170
Might be trying to hide his tracks.

30
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,800
Could be a sign of remorse.

31
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:19,610
Apologizing for the murder
by minimizing the mess.

32
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,090
But there's one other commonality
between both sets of murders.

33
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,970
Bleach and ammonia were found
under the victim's fingernails.

34
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,980
He's making them clean
up their own murder.

35
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,700
It's the same unsub.

Author Harlan Ellison wrote,

40
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:16,380
the minute people fall in
love, they become liars.

41
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:20,910
So if the unsub changed the victimology,
does that make him organized or disorganized?

42
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,660
Well, the prostitutes point
one way, the club goes another.

43
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,360
The triangular arrangement of the
cleaning supplies is interesting.

44
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,420
Obsessive-compulsive?

45
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,780
Might have been institutionalized.

46
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,660
We're missing the forest
for the trees here.

47
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,580
This guy started with prostitutes--
a high-risk victimology.

48
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,250
Took a year off, came
back, killed a socialite.

49
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,130
No forced entry, no
coercion of any kind.

50
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,030
Exactly.

51
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:43,520
So how does our unsub go from
loser of the year to don juan?

52
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,950
Actually, as byron interpreted him, don
juan was an ironic reversal of sex roles.

53
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:52,060
And when--
th--that's about it.

54
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:56,790
Something must have happened between the last prostitute
and Vanessa Holden making him change his victimology.

55
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,140
Could the unsub have known Vanessa?

56
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,190
It's unlikely. Sexual
sadists attack anonymously.

57
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,130
They have to sever a personal connection
and see their victims as objects

58
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,370
to perpetrate this level of torture.

59
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,170
We have to build
two profiles, then--

60
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:11,960
One for the unsub who killed prostitutes,
one for the unsub who goes to clubs.

61
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,400
We've never done that before.

62
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,660
Prentiss is right.

63
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:18,550
The victimology is so different, we'll treat
them as separate unsubs and see what overlaps.

64
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,170
Reid, work up a geographic profile,
focus on location of the murders.

65
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,240
Prentiss and Rossi,
concentrate on the prostitutes.

66
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:27,630
Jordan, Morgan, and i will
go deal with Vanessa Holden.

67
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,510
<i>ATLANTA....</i>

68
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,970
Detective harding?

69
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,450
Agent Jordan Todd.

70
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,140
Thank you for coming.

71
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,860
Ssas Hotchner, Morgan, Dr. Reid.

72
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,050
- How you doing?
- How are you?

73
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,820
Hey, is there a dna match between
the unsub and the prostitutes?

74
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,880
We could run through vicap just in case.

75
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,820
Um, there's no dna at all.

76
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,200
No prints, no fibers.

77
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,710
Just like Vanessa,
everything gets cleaned up.

78
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,650
Pretty effective
forensic countermeasure.

79
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,780
What about witnesses? Somebody
must have seen something.

80
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,290
Oh, yeah. Lots of people.

81
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,600
So you have a sketch.

82
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,370
It's a little vague.

83
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:07,410
That's because of this guy's
other countermeasure. Take a look.

84
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:13,610
So this guy right
here, that's our killer.

85
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,220
It looks like a fedora.

86
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,560
So he's drawing attention to his face
while simultaneously obscuring it.

87
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:19,920
It's called
peacocking--

88
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:24,350
The adornment of some sort of flashy
affect to sort of try to distract witnesses.

89
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,780
So none of your witness
statements agree?

90
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,910
He had a mole, "he didn't have a mole."

91
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,530
He had a gap between his teeth,
no, his teeth were perfect.

92
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,080
Detective, we're gonna have to
have a sit-down with Ashley Holden.

93
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,130
She got the best look at the unsub.

94
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,020
Well, i wish i could make
that happen, but unfortunately,

95
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:40,090
The family has decided
to stop cooperating.

96
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,070
Why is that?

97
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,500
They won't say.

98
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,730
Yesterday the mother would move heaven and
earth to help find her daughter's killer.

99
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,820
Today, no, thanks.
I'll take care of this.

100
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:54,210
Garcia... Is there any leverage you can give
me that will help with the Holden family?

101
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,030
Sugar, if they broke the law, that'd be one
thing, but they haven't done anything wrong.

102
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,430
What about public record?

103
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,160
Anything that might explain
why the family shut down?

104
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,290
I've got scads of blog postings on them.

105
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,740
The Holdens were movers
and shakers in the city.

106
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,830
And the nasty stuff follows the money.

107
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,700
Like what?

108
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,800
The Holdens got what
they had "coming to them."

109
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,770
Why did Ashley get her sister killed?

110
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:17,210
Yikes. "how much to gut the slutty one?"

111
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,670
Could you forward those to me?

112
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,890
Good afternoon.

113
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,820
I'm sorry you came all the way out here.

114
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:32,100
It's a waste of tim Ashley
knows absolutely nothing.

115
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,720
And we want to get this
behind us as soon as possible.

116
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,790
Mrs. Holden, we can't begin to
fathom the loss you've suffered.

117
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,900
That's right. You can't.

118
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:46,050
But, um...

119
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,050
I lost my older sister in a car crash.

120
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:54,900
And it was really hard on our family
because she was the responsible one.

121
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:59,990
She was the one that my mother
always counted on to watch over us.

122
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,440
And when she died, my mother
wouldn't let the police in.

123
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:09,350
If she didn't let them in, then
my sister wasn't really dead.

124
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,520
This man is a monster,
and we can catch him.

125
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:17,910
But we need your daughter's help.

126
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,230
- If you accuse her of
anything... - Ma'am--

127
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:28,140
- i will be on the phone so fast...
- Ma'am, ma'am, we won't.

128
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:37,490
All right. Follow me.

129
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,070
Did you know that about Jordan?

130
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,660
No, and neither did she.

131
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:49,080
According to her file,
she's an only child.

132
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,800
Vanessa's boyfriend just broke up with
her, so i took her out to, you know...

133
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,580
To have a good time. There's
nothing wrong with that.

134
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,530
We you approached by anyone?

135
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,050
Guys.

136
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,580
Can you describe any of them for us?

137
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,200
Ordinary.

138
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:09,210
Look, Vanessa wasn't even in the mood.

139
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,220
So if she wasn't in the mood,
if she left with this guy,

140
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:15,730
Then there must have been something
about him, something unique.

141
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,670
We saw a picture of him on surveillance, and
we know that he was dressed like a rocker.

142
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,730
So he was pretty flashy, right?

143
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,530
What was the first thing
you noticed about him?

144
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,660
His attitude.

145
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:30,070
What about it? Cocky? Confident?

146
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,510
Or did he play it more the broody type?

147
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:37,520
He was like-- he was hitting on us, but he was,
like, making a joke out of it at the same time.

148
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,870
Seriously. You don't recognize me?

149
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:43,490
I will give you 3 more guesses.

150
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,990
You know, even his eyes,
they were different colors.

151
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,880
So this guy wanted to be noticed.

152
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,410
Yeah. That's why you
go to a club, right?

153
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,740
And then he had these games.

154
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,560
Like, he would bet us drinks
that we couldn't get his number.

155
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,790
Or this other one.

156
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,570
There. Ok. Let me make
sure you didn't screw it up.

157
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,660
Hmm, ok.

158
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:09,480
- The camera really does add 10 pounds.
- What?

159
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,280
You're so...

160
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,890
She didn't even want
to go out that night.

161
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:19,290
I had to drag her to the club.

162
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:23,480
The last thing she said to me before
i left her alone with that guy was,

163
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,140
"i had the best time tonight."

164
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,020
The best time.

165
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,990
The information about Vanessa Holden being
the responsible sister, where did you get that?

166
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:44,360
Some of it was on-line, and some of it was
just an educated guess based on birth order.

167
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,200
A guess. And in the process, you lied.

168
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:50,480
That mother was shut down. I
needed to salvage some rapport.

169
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,410
I don't know how you did
things in counter-terrorism,

170
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,150
But we don't make it a habit
to lie to get the job done.

171
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,600
I got you in the door, didn't i?

172
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:02,160
Not only do you represent the
fbi, you represent this team--

173
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:03,700
To the press, the police,

174
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:06,610
and to the families who are struggling with
some of the hardest times of their lives.

175
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,410
If you get caught in a lie, the trust we
depend on to help solve these crimes disappears.

176
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,220
Do i make myself clear?

177
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:17,110
- It won't happen again.
- No, it won't.

178
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,970
When we get back, i want you to
prepare a press release about the unsub.

179
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,890
Do not release it.

180
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,330
From now on, everything goes through me.

181
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,720
Yeah, dave?

182
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,680
So how bad did i just screw up?

183
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:43,460
On a normal scale of
1 to 10, i'd say a 6,

184
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,580
but on Hotch's scale, an 11.

185
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:55,020
The unsub killed the prostitutes in separate
pay-by-the-hour motels ifulton county,

186
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,600
Right there in one of the
poorer neighborhoods he area.

187
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:01,540
Now, Vanessa Holden's apartment was in the
peachtree district, where there's a lot of big money.

188
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:05,520
Based on the geography, he isn't just changing his
victimology, he's changed his whole tax bracket.

189
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,940
The high profile of Vanessa
Holden bears that out.

190
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,990
By killing her, he was
climbing the social ladder.

191
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:12,750
If that's the case, this
unsub had a long way to climb.

192
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:16,140
Both prostitutes advertised
here. Look at their pictures.

193
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,640
Subservient positioning,
asking to be dominated.

194
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,050
Promising to come to you?

195
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,510
That cuts out the social interaction
of meeting on a street corner.

196
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:25,400
That's a long way from a
self-assured unsub who hits the clubs.

197
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,290
Except he took a year
off between the murders.

198
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,050
Maybe he took that
time to change himself.

199
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,830
- That's impossible.
- Why?

200
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,020
Well, i mean, you're talking
about a total transformation here.

201
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:37,600
I mean how you talk, i mean how you
dress, how you think about yourself.

202
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,390
Difficult maybe. Not impossible.

203
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,930
He already started killing.

204
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,930
There must have been a secondary trigger
that motivated him to change who he was.

205
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:48,020
So if you're gonna transform
yourself, how would you do it?

206
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:50,390
A steady diet of self-help books.

207
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,550
Start hitting the gym?

208
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,800
You have to learn how to read people.

209
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,800
I mean, what is a pick-up?
It's basically just a profile.

210
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:59,090
Decoding cues of interest
and recoding similar ones.

211
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,920
If you're too obvious,
you turn off your target.

212
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,740
If you're oblivious, your target
moves on to a better profiler.

213
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,790
That doesn't sound like
something he could do on his own.

214
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,580
No. He'd have to go
somewhere to learn it.

215
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,450
Yeah. A self-help class maybe?

216
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:13,290
Uh, wait a minute. Come on.
An unsub who kills prostitutes.

217
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,970
Is he really thinking about signing
up for a tony robbins seminar?

218
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:21,230
He would if he found a class in the
same place he found the prostitutes.

219
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:24,600
<i>LEARN HOW TO PICK UP CHICKS</i>

220
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,430
I like your style.

221
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,300
Well, the preliminary autopsy came back.
The victim's name is Becky Williams.

222
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,660
- Was she disemboweled?
- No.

223
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,640
And what's even weirder is the
cleaning supplies were set out,

224
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,740
But there was no traces
of them on her body.

225
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,840
Why would the unsub alter his signate
and push her out of an 8-story window?

226
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:55,330
Escalating to sadism maybe?

227
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:58,480
Gutting and cleaning are what
he has to do to find release.

228
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,900
He wouldn't change that.

229
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,980
Well, why not? He's changed
everything else about himself.

230
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,360
Did anyone see the unsub?

231
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:05,070
No surveillance cameras at the club.

232
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,850
Becky's friends say she was
talking to a guy with sunglasses.

233
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,480
Sunglasses.

234
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:12,190
So why did he pull out the cleaning
supplies and then not use them?

235
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:15,740
On all the other scenes, the bottles
were arranged in a precise order.

236
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,340
Here they're just part of the mess.

237
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,960
Maybe she fought back.And when
becky went over the railing,

238
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:23,780
his routine had been compromised
because he knew the police would respond.

239
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:26,510
Or she could have jumped.

240
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,200
Her nervous system
was pumping adrenaline.

241
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,750
Her fight or flight response kicks in.

242
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,860
He struck two fridays in a row, and
if his routine's been interrupted,

243
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,760
It might compel him to strike again.

244
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:39,780
It's saturday. The clubs
will be packed tonight.

245
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,510
Take a look at the classes
the unsub might have taken.

246
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,270
We need to generate a suspect
pool as soon as possible.

247
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,090
Ok.

248
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,440
Can detective harding get a
copy of the sketch to Garcia?

249
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,720
Did you find anything outside?

250
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,290
No. But i think there might
be a new pattern emerging.

251
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,950
- Garcia, you ready?
- Sending it now.

252
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:01,620
Please be aware that 30 minutes with photoshop
does not allow for much artistic flourish.

253
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:06,010
Both times the unsub has gone to a club, he's
had some costume, but now there's a theme--

254
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:10,680
A fedora and colored contacts,
sunglasses, each time obscuring--

255
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:13,050
Are you ready, Garcia?

256
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,430
This area.

257
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,920
Now, yes, maybe he's trying
to draw attention to him,

258
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,250
But maybe he's trying to
draw attention away from here.

259
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:24,580
Something he knows is identifiable--
a birthmark or a scar maybe.

260
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:27,700
We need to get these out. Jordan,
release these to the press.

261
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:32,430
Which is why we're encouraging women
to be on the lookout for this man.

262
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:36,470
He has been seen at club
omega, suffragette city.

263
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:41,030
And we believe he may be attending
similar nightclubs in the midtown district.

264
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:46,270
He may have a scar or a
birthmark on his left eye.

265
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:52,990
Based on witness descriptions and
captured images, the suspect is white,

266
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,390
mid-to late 20s, and i repeat,

267
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,650
- he may have a scar or a birthmark...
- Hotch.

268
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:00,690
What did you find out?

269
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,160
Of the 20 self-described pickup
artist classes in the area,

270
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:09,700
There's only one guy who encourages his
students to dress like, uh, space cowboys.

271
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,820
Are you ready to meet viper?

272
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:19,080
Men are put on this earth to hunt women.

273
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:21,860
And even though women deny
it, they want to be hunted.

274
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,300
They need it.

275
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,120
It's part of our biological
imperative as animals.

276
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:29,400
And the competition the
opposite sex puts you through--

277
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:33,560
Pitting you against other guys,
against your own friends even,

278
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:39,670
It's all to reassure themselves that they
have brought home the best possible mate.

279
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,500
It's just like you.

280
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:47,070
They want someone who's gonna make
their eyeballs roll back in their head.

281
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:53,110
My job is to help you slash
past every defense, every excuse,

282
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:57,730
every,"why don't you meet my friend"
trick that they're gonna throw at you.

283
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:01,410
You may not have ripped
abs or afford table service,

284
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:05,640
but if you're smarter and...

285
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:11,360
More interesting, then you
will be a better predator,

286
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,810
because this is the jungle, my friends.

287
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,810
And your prey wants to be caught.

288
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:19,400
Will you listen to that language?

289
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,640
- He's training serial killers.
- Great.

290
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:27,010
We're dealing with a rampant narcissist and misogynist
who's turned himself into a snake oil salesman.

291
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:30,470
That's one more thing he
has in common with our unsub.

292
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,500
So you think this-- what did you
call him-- unsub took my class

293
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:38,550
he copied your "the camera adds
10 pounds" routine verbatim.

294
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:41,080
Yeah. That's a good gag.

295
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:45,280
If you could just give us your atndance
lists, it might help us find him.

296
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,820
- No.
- No?

297
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:51,640
My clients expect a certain
amount of confidentiality.

298
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:52,720
I won't compromise that.

299
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,390
We can come back with a warrant.

300
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,520
Be my guest.

301
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:59,950
But keep in mind, the money i make
doesn't just pay for my fabulous lifestyle,

302
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:03,400
It also keeps some very
expensive lawyers on retainer.

303
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:06,450
What club did you go to last night?

304
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,740
It's a legitimate question.

305
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,290
You seem to know a lot
about our investigation.

306
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,280
Two things to
learn about me--

307
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:20,140
First i outwit alpha males like
you for fun and sometimes profit.

308
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:23,820
How often do you have to rely
on your badge to score, baldy?

309
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,430
Second, last night, i was at club aqua,

310
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:31,810
And i have a stack of tax-deductible
drink receipts to back up my story.

311
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:35,100
Now, you might not want to
believe that my style works.

312
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:40,260
And here in this harsh
light, you have the advantage.

313
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,470
But meet me on my turf...

314
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,370
Oh, the things i could make you do.

315
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,470
If you, um, have any
questions, give us a call.

316
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,000
Please tell me we are
not giving up on that guy.

317
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,980
We're just getting started.

318
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,000
H--he actually said
that? To Prentiss?

319
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:14,360
Yes, he did. So what can
you tell me about him?

320
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:17,990
I can tell you the viper's
real name is Paul thomas.

321
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:23,190
And before he rechristened himself,
he had a major mullet going on.

322
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:25,800
Garcia, we need the names
of all of his students.

323
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,700
I'm gonna need a couple
hours for a work-around.

324
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,430
I also need you to send Reid everything
you can about what this guy teaches.

325
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:34,320
I think the unsub's
using one of his routines.

326
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:37,360
We need to start building
a linguistic profile.

327
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:43,400
Sir, does this guy's stuff actually
work on real breathing girls?

328
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,200
Why are you asking me?

329
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,180
I abhor the whole
chicks dig jerks thing.

330
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:50,960
Well, fortunately, Garcia,
you're one of the exceptions.

331
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:55,070
Well,be still my bespeckled
heart. So are you, sir.

332
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,760
Thanks.

333
00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:01,920
Hotch, this is melissa foster.
She recognized the sketch.

334
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:04,150
I'm ssa Hotchner thank
you for coming in.

335
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,110
You sure you've seen this man?

336
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,100
Yeah. I gave him the scar.

337
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,980
Did you meet him in a club?

338
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:14,370
No. I was a prostitute.

339
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,830
This happened about a year ago.

340
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:20,540
- And i was in bad shape.
- Heroin?

341
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,730
But you got clean.

342
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,810
My girl,Cheryl, told me if
i put an ad in the paper,

343
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,310
It'd be safer than
walking the streets.So...

344
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:32,710
One day you got a call,
right, to meet you at a motel?

345
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,660
Yeah.

346
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,550
When you walked in, you
knew you were in trouble.

347
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,780
He couldn't meet your eye.

348
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:41,870
He was, um, kind of shifty maybe?

349
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,500
He paced.

350
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,700
I spent the first half-hour
trying to get him to relax,

351
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:48,680
Because if he can
relax, then i can relax.

352
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,380
But he just wanted to rant.

353
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,640
What did he say?

354
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,470
He said i was the help.

355
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:57,200
They don't even see you.
You're nothing. The help.

356
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:00,600
I had customers like this all the time.

357
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:02,330
They work out one of two ways.

358
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:06,880
Either they want to tie you up, and you
just say no or they want to be tied up,

359
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:11,770
In which case you do it and,
uh, you steal their wallet.

360
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,390
He didn't want to tie you up, did he?

361
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,300
No.

362
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:29,330
You know what i remember about the
whole thing, like crystal clear?

363
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:32,630
It wasn't the pain
that sent him running.

364
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:34,860
It was the mess.

365
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:39,360
There's no record of your
attack-- police, hospital. Nothing.

366
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:41,220
Why didn't you come forward?

367
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:43,200
I wasn't ready to kick it yet.

368
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:47,270
I was this close to dying for two weeks.

369
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,040
And when i got back on
my feet, i realized...

370
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:53,200
You just didn't want to
live like that anymore.

371
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:59,020
If he hadn't attacked
me, i would have D.-ed.

372
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:02,870
He saved my life.

373
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,660
Our unsub is a confident alpha male.

374
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:12,920
He is white. He's between
the ages of 25 and 30.

375
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:18,070
He's in excellent physical shape to overpower
women and also to feed his self-image.

376
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:19,620
He has an obsession with cleaning.

377
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:23,340
He probably works in some service
industry, wiping up after others,

378
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,720
Convinced everyone looks down at him.

379
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:30,260
His change in himself and
his victimology reflects that.

380
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,440
This is the kind of guy who
wants to stand out in a crowd.

381
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,690
He's taken a class in
how to pick up women.

382
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,440
So he'll repeat a series of
well-rehearsed lines and mind games.

383
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,920
He may be uneducated, but
he's by no means stupid.

384
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:45,000
Taking this class has given him the ability
to read verbal cues and body language.

385
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:47,950
One classic routine the viper
promotes is called the push-pull.

386
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:52,070
He'll insert himself between two women
and immediately after complimenting one,

387
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:55,200
He'll deliver a subtle insult,
then pay attention to the other.

388
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:58,510
Those are really nice
earrings. I like those.

389
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,510
Thanks.

390
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:02,990
My grandmother wears a lot of
fake jewelry also. It looks nice.

391
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,810
Ignoring the one man puts her in
direct competition with her friend

392
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,670
And causes the other to
pursue you more aggressively.

393
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,310
I was just demonstrating. So i'm sorry.

394
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,320
Well, we've mapped
the hot spots he hits.

395
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,280
And he frequents the same
clubs that the viper does,

396
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:16,700
So we need eyes and
ears in every single one.

397
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,830
Circulate the sketch
as widely as possible.

398
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,420
We'll need everyone aware that
there's a killer out there.

399
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:23,860
Thank you very much.

400
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,860
I think i might just stay home
and man the tip line tonight.

401
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,210
Clubs aren't really my thing.

402
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,480
Not a chance, kid. I need
a wingman. Come on, now.

403
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:34,250
Actually, there is another
angle we need to pursue.

404
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:37,060
We still don't know what made
the unsub change his victimology,

405
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,990
What made him stop killing
prostitutes and move into the clubs.

406
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,950
The answer might be
something in viper's class,

407
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,390
But to figure that out, we
need to profile the teacher.

408
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,970
You need to bait him, then, with
someone he sees as a challenge.

409
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,470
We need to study his style
up close and personal.

410
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,750
It's gonna take someone that
he's already attracted to.

411
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,600
Oh, this is really gonna suck.

412
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,570
- Prentiss?
- Yeah. Come on in.

413
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,980
Hey, i'm 10 minutes away.

414
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,660
You're ok with this, right?

415
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:17,060
Yeah. I'll be fine.

416
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:20,990
Sadly, i've actually dated
people worse than viper.

417
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,730
Is something going on with Jordan?

418
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:29,030
Um, you asked me to keep an eye on her.

419
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,740
And, frankly, i've noticed some tension.

420
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,360
I caught her in a lie.

421
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,520
She cut a corner to get us
in with the Holden family.

422
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:38,280
Did she misrepresent the bureau?

423
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:41,170
She misrepresented herself.

424
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,670
So how long is she
gonna be in the doghouse?

425
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:47,030
Until she proves she's competent.

426
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:51,250
That's gonna be tricky if you're
scrutinizing her every move.

427
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,810
Prentiss, you seem to do ok.

428
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:59,040
I think in order for Jordan to
prove she's good at this job,

429
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:01,280
It's not gonna happen
under a magnifying glass.

430
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:04,610
You're gonna have to
give her the opportunity.

431
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:08,150
You have something in mind?

432
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:15,320
When you think about the
nature of serial crimes,

433
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,410
it's amazing there aren't
more predators in the clubs.

434
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:21,090
I mean, excessive amounts of alcohol,
countless opportunities for date rape drugs,

435
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:25,150
Not to mention surprisingly
risky behavior being pursued.

436
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:27,690
All right. So who wants a flier?

437
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,840
Nobody? Ok. All right.

438
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,680
- So how's it going?
- Not good.

439
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:38,490
I gave the profile to one woman,
she asked if i was the unsub.

440
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,020
- How are you doing?
- Well, i gave out all my fliers.

441
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,770
How many phone numbers did you get?

442
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:45,890
None. I'm working a case here, kid.

443
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:50,140
Ok, 4 were offered, but
i didn't take any of them.

444
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:52,170
All right. Look, let me
school you real quick.

445
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:56,940
What you have to do with these ladies,
just take control of the conversation.

446
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:59,270
When you're talking, what
makes you feel like an expert?

447
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,590
Uh, statistics.

448
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,250
No. Trust me. No. Something else.

449
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:07,810
- Um, well, when i do magic.
- See? See, that's perfect.

450
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:10,240
Chicks dig magic.

451
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,330
I'm gonna give you a chance
to work it. Come here.

452
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:19,670
Excuse me, sweetheart.
Whenever you get a chance.

453
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,090
What can i get you?

454
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:25,100
We're with the fbi. We're
looking for this man.

455
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:27,880
Does he look at all familiar to you?

456
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:29,500
It's not much of a picture.

457
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,620
I know.You know what might help, acally,

458
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:37,380
is he has a scar on his
eye right about there.

459
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:41,710
We also know that he's taken
classes where he's learned how to

460
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:47,510
distract and charm his victim.

461
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,780
Ok. How diyou do that?

462
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,270
That's privileged information.

463
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:00,220
- So what do i do if i see him?
- You should call us.

464
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:03,730
Even if you just think you see
him, you should definitely call us.

465
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:08,390
And if i don't see him...
Can i still call you?

466
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:13,170
Yeah. Yeah. You can call me. Yeah.

467
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:17,310
Ok. Cool. Wait. I
don't have your number.

468
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,610
Oh, it's behind your barrette.

469
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,930
Bye.

470
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:32,460
See? There you go. That's what i'm
talking about. That's called game.

471
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,430
That's an excellent question.

472
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:46,680
Once you know a chick is
interested, how do you proceed?

473
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:54,350
Allow me to demonstrate.

474
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,950
This is a nice surprise.

475
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,880
Well, the atlanta p.d. And the fbi
are combing all the bars you go to.

476
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:14,470
And it looks like i
pulled the short straw.

477
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,810
Lucky me, then.

478
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:21,060
So... Why do you do it?

479
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:26,400
Why do you teach guys how
to be somebody they're not?

480
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:29,390
Because it's a game, one i'm good at.

481
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,620
And i want to help other
guys get good at it, too.

482
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:34,910
So...

483
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:40,620
Affection, sex, emotional commitment.
That's all just for fun, huh?

484
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:45,160
No. The fun is in the initial spark.

485
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:50,690
It's that thing a guy does in the first
5 seconds that makes you go... Him.

486
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,970
What you're talking about
is a different beast.

487
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:57,410
You can't fake it. You have to want it.

488
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:04,180
Now, why are you really here?

489
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,760
Is, um, this the guy you
were telling me about?

490
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:16,440
Viper, meet ssa Jordan
Todd from the B.A.U.

491
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:19,650
Jordan, this is viper--
god's gift to women.

492
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:24,240
God sure has a sense of humor.

493
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,130
You brought a friend.

494
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:30,930
You promised if i met you on your
turf, you'd show me something special.

495
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:33,660
So let's see it.

496
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:37,360
Yeah, viper, who gets pushed
and who gets pulled tonight?

497
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:46,630
Is this the one that if you stare at it
long enough, you see the image of a swan?

498
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,330
I'm just wondering
if we missed anything.

499
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,670
Remember, i said there
was a secondary trigger.

500
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,980
We never found it.

501
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:57,270
Maybe it's something that came from
the class.Prentiss could still--

502
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:01,140
what he took from the class
brought him to Vanessa Holden,

503
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:06,190
But i'm talking about something
much deeper psychologically.

504
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,640
Think about this.

505
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:11,780
This unsub always goes to
his victim's apartments.

506
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,670
Never his own place. Why is that?

507
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,640
Well, there must be
some restriction there.

508
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,960
A nagging girlfriend,
a crying baby maybe,

509
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:24,650
some reminder of how
miserable his life is.

510
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:27,500
Which he's taking out on his victims.

511
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:33,460
You see, eye contact is
a very powerful gauge.

512
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:35,640
It's why you tend to look away
from someone you're attracted to

513
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:40,160
Because you know instinctively
what a dead giveaway it is.

514
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,650
But your brain goes there anyway.

515
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:45,410
Images, fantasies.

516
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:48,530
Don't flatter yourself.

517
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:51,100
The eyes don't lie. They dilate.

518
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:53,370
It's a chemical response.
We can't control it.

519
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:56,220
Ok, 15 seconds. What do you see?

520
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,860
Nope. No change. No dilation.

521
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:01,550
I guess chemically we're not a match.

522
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:03,530
Only because you have
someone else on the mind.

523
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:07,600
Once that happens, the attraction
center in the brain shuts wn.

524
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,500
- Your turn.
- No.

525
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:17,640
Are you scared i might be right? Yeah?

526
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:20,090
No, Paul, i'm baffled.

527
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:23,020
I cannot figure out what the
unsub could have learned from you.

528
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:26,320
What do you mean?He
took my look, my words,

529
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:29,020
everything that makes me
successful to the opposite sex.

530
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:32,750
Really? Because that guy can get
beautiful women into his apartment.

531
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,500
I wouldn't let you on my facebook page.

532
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:35,980
- Oh, you're on facebook?
- Yeah.

533
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:38,030
- You should friend me.
- I will.

534
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,410
I gave him the routines
that made him what he is.

535
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,060
It must all be in the salesmanship then.

536
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,350
'Cause we've been watching
all the women in the club.

537
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:49,640
And not one of them has looked at you.

538
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:52,240
So who do you really go home with, Paul?

539
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:55,900
Or--or do you
go home alone?

540
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,090
That was really good,
ladies. That was really good.

541
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,730
Don't you think i know why you're here?

542
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:13,720
One of my students copies my moves,
and you're here to get inside my mind.

543
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:15,150
Don't you see?

544
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,160
I confronted my queen
bee a long time ago.

545
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:19,750
- What's a queen bee?
- You are.

546
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:24,420
And so is every other confident girl
in here who's loud when she's drunk.

547
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:27,800
The social butterfly, the alpha female.

548
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:31,320
Every student who's ever taken
my class has had one in his life.

549
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:37,260
And the first exercise my students have
to complete is to confront their queen bee.

550
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:41,230
It could be the girl who cheated on
you or the prom date who stood you up.

551
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:45,800
But you find them and squash them.

552
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,960
Our unsub knew Vanessa Holden.

553
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,850
How do you know?

554
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:57,660
It's viper's first
confidence building exercise.

555
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:59,990
Find the source of your first
rejection and make her pay for it.

556
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:01,460
That's why he stopped
seeing prostitutes.

557
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,870
He took viper's class and decided
to confront Vanessa Holden.

558
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:07,540
It makes sense with what he
said to Vanessa that night.

559
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,470
Don't you know who i am? Look closer.

560
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,310
He meant it literally.

561
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,180
We need to talk to the family again.

562
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:19,120
So what you're saying is that you
think my daughter knew her killer.

563
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:22,330
It would have been someone that
she possibly met at a young age,

564
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:25,540
Maybe a boyfriend, someone she rejected.

565
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:27,620
No. Vanessa told me
about all her boyfriends.

566
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:31,400
How about someone who expressed
himself sexually to Vanessa?

567
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:34,000
It would have been
awkward, embarrassing.

568
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:38,200
And he would have had issues
with cleanliness or cleaning.

569
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,950
What is it?

570
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:44,800
That woman who used to clean for
us, the one who brought her son.

571
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:45,870
Who was she?

572
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,180
I don't remember her name.

573
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:49,350
There have been so many
people through this house,

574
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:53,160
But i remember when she
brought this young boy in.

575
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:55,550
- He was odd.
- How?

576
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,770
He was inappropriate.

577
00:32:56,790 --> 00:33:01,210
He would hide in the
closet and then watch.

578
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:04,460
I caught him one day with Vanessa.

579
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:06,920
What are you doing in here?

580
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,550
We--we--we weren't
doing anything.

581
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,460
He made me.

582
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:14,160
You are coming with me. Get over here.

583
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:20,250
And what did you do?

584
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,810
I did what any parent would do.

585
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,960
Do you understand what you did?

586
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:28,780
Do you know what you did?

587
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:34,070
That's for talking to
her... And that's for this.

588
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,870
Don't you ever do that
again. Don't you ever.

589
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:46,190
Mom!

590
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,840
Well, don't look at me.

591
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:50,400
That boy had no sense
of boundaries whatsoever.

592
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:53,130
He needed to be taught a lesson.

593
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:56,460
Do you happen to have any records
of the employee, the mother?

594
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:58,460
No. Everyone got paid in cash.

595
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:02,190
Bobby. His name was bobby.

596
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,820
Vanessa called him a pervert.

597
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:05,610
I fired the mother that day.

598
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:11,680
It was awful, but there's a service that i
remember that i used to get my domestics from.

599
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:15,690
It was in fulton county.

600
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:21,300
Last call, people! Last call.

601
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:27,280
See, your loveline's broken up, which
means you haven't found your soul mate yet.

602
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:28,860
- Well, that's true.
- Yeah.

603
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:33,550
It's really amazing. You see it in
these couples that are together forever.

604
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:37,130
The lines on their palms change,

605
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:40,780
so they--they become
mirror images of each other.

606
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:43,140
- Really?
- Really.

607
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:47,610
Why don't we--why don't
we get out of here?

608
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:50,090
And i can tell you more about it.

609
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:52,970
What the hell?

610
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,540
I'm sorry.

611
00:34:56,410 --> 00:34:58,440
Hey, you were holding
on to me kind of tight.

612
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:00,810
We're leaving.

613
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:05,450
You know what? I have some club soda in
the back if you want to clean that up.

614
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:10,190
Yeah. Yeah. Why don't
you let me do that?

615
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,080
Just, uh, right back here.

616
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,260
I need you to stay right here, ok?

617
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:26,780
Who is that guy?

618
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:35,730
Come on. Come on. Come on.

619
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:46,950
the bouncer saw austin go out the
back. She likes to smoke back here.

620
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,350
Well, based on the witness' description, itit
definitely sounds like the unsub was here.

621
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,240
We got unis at her
apartment, but no one's home.

622
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,640
- Hey, it's austin. Leave a message.
- It keeps going straight to voicemail.

623
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:58,330
Maybe we could have Garcia try to triangulate
where she is based on the cell phone.

624
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,250
He has her.

625
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:14,570
When you asked him if he practices
his routine on a sex doll,

626
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,480
I almost lost it.

627
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:20,290
You know, as much as i hate
what that guy stands for,

628
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:25,100
I still read "five ways to get
noticed" in "cosmo" magazine.

629
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:27,800
Because it makes sense.

630
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:32,420
Emily, thanks for doing this.

631
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,770
Absolutely.

632
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:38,270
I need you both out here. The
unsub's kidnapped another victim.

633
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,930
Garcia, you've got
viper's attendance records?

634
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,660
Got it. I'm ready to play the player.

635
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:49,210
Start with robert. Narrow down
the permutations. Bob, bobby.

636
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,570
That gives us 23 suspects.

637
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:53,460
- Do you have access to birth records?
- Yeah.

638
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:57,390
Pull the mothers' names and cross-reference
with work and home addresses in fulton county.

639
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,210
Hold on. Bingo.

640
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:03,010
Robert c. Parker lives
at 932 pryor street.

641
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,590
Oh, pryor's 5 miles from here.

642
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,600
Let's go. Jordan, have
swat meet us at the site.

643
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:25,970
You made a mess, and now
you're gonna clean it up.

644
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:35,680
Clean it up! Clean it up!

645
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:38,440
Clean it up!

646
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:42,980
Clean it up!

647
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:45,620
Faster. Faster.

648
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:49,220
You heard me saying "faster"?

649
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,120
First team in position.

650
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:02,310
I'll do--whatever you say
you want me to do, i'll do it.

651
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,130
I'll do it. Ok.

652
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:11,880
The help... Doesn't talk.

653
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,010
Fbi!

654
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:33,920
Stay there. Stay there.

655
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:38,130
Get this off. Get it off. Get it off.

656
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,200
Ok. It's ok.

657
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:41,650
- I called you.
- I know. I know. I know.

658
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:44,460
I called you.

659
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:48,160
Let's go.

660
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:52,550
Please, please, please.

661
00:38:56,030 --> 00:39:01,360
Who's that? Some... Somebody out there?

662
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:13,860
Who are you? What do you want?

663
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:15,950
Mrs. Parker?

664
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,710
Where's robert? Where's my son?

665
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,150
Everything's gonna be ok.
We're gonna get you some help.

666
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:24,690
No. Please. I need robert.

667
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:28,080
I need to be changed.

668
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:30,790
He's just outside, ma'am.

669
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,100
It's a dialysis pump.

670
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:36,440
It was issued 10 months ago.

671
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:41,350
We found our secondary trigger.

672
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:51,510
P.j.o'rourke wrote, cleanliness becomes
more important when godliness is unlikely.

673
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:54,810
Come in.

674
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:57,770
- My report.
- Thank you.

675
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,990
Jordan?

676
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,620
Prentiss said you were
excellent in the field.

677
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:06,060
Astute, responsive. You
thought well on your feet.

678
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,420
She's being generous. I really
enjoyed working with her.

679
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:12,690
You also posited early on that
Vanessa Holden might know the unsub.

680
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:16,060
Well, he didn't fit the
profile of a sexual sadist.

681
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,430
And you were right.

682
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:21,800
Clearly, our unsub was more
complicated than the profile.

683
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:26,440
Anyway, i just wanted you to know
that you have the green light again.

684
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:29,950
- And i trust your judgment.
- Thank you.

685
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,730
- How are you feeling?
- Great.

686
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:44,540
I told my hmo i got abducted by a serial
killer, so they gave me free dental x-rays.

687
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:48,510
I'm glad your stay at the
hospital wasn't too terrible, then.

688
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,240
Ah, my doctor gave me
a clean bill of health.

689
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:53,680
He told me i could even go
back to work if i wanted to.

690
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:55,780
All righty. Back to
bartending. All right.

691
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:58,580
No. I quit that job.

692
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:03,320
My recent brush with death has inspired
me to pursue a different career.

693
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:05,260
Well, that's--that's
very exciting news.

694
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:07,510
What's, um--what
is the new job path?

695
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:12,360
Uh, well, i was thinking
about taking up magic.

696
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:15,600
Have you opened the package yet?

697
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:18,680
What is this?

698
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:27,260
Is this your card?

699
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,130
Yeah. It, uh, it is my card.

700
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,870
Cool.
