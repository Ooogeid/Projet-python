1
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,631
Joe, what's your 20?

2
00:00:07,274 --> 00:00:08,669
Almost done with rounds.

3
00:00:08,794 --> 00:00:10,229
Just checking the carousel.

4
00:00:10,354 --> 00:00:12,943
You need some backup?
I'm falling asleep here.

5
00:00:13,068 --> 00:00:16,558
No. But could you leave
a cupful of coffee in the pot?

6
00:00:42,045 --> 00:00:43,629
Anyone back here?

7
00:00:56,383 --> 00:00:58,547
This is private property.

8
00:00:58,937 --> 00:01:01,560
I'm gonna give you 5 seconds
to come on out.

9
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:18,736
Funny, Don.

10
00:01:18,861 --> 00:01:21,789
I'm a man of simple pleasures,
and that was one of them.

11
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:23,392
What are you doing back here?

12
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:25,793
Switching out a timing belt.
What are you doing back here?

13
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:27,743
Thought I saw someone
messing around.

14
00:01:27,868 --> 00:01:29,275
Nah, it was just me.

15
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,423
It wasn't you.

16
00:01:34,407 --> 00:01:36,348
- Turn it off.
- What?

17
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:38,299
Turn it off!

18
00:01:43,553 --> 00:01:44,720
What?

19
00:02:01,908 --> 00:02:02,930
Ed?

20
00:02:03,055 --> 00:02:05,207
- Go ahead.
- You need to send that backup.

21
00:02:21,818 --> 00:02:23,877
I see checkmate in 5.
What do you see?

22
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:25,811
I see it in 3.

23
00:02:41,435 --> 00:02:43,829
- We've missed you out here.
- Thank you.

24
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,624
Thanks. I, uh, I had
to take a little break.

25
00:02:47,248 --> 00:02:48,157
How come?

26
00:02:48,282 --> 00:02:50,211
I used to play with
a co-worker friend of mine.

27
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:52,488
He's probably the best mind
I ever went up against.

28
00:02:52,613 --> 00:02:55,341
One day, he just decided that
he didn't want to play anymore.

29
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:56,798
So you gave up, too?

30
00:02:56,923 --> 00:02:58,575
Just the opposite.
I attempted to play

31
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,693
through every permutation
of moves on a chessboard.

32
00:03:00,818 --> 00:03:03,390
- That's an infinite number of games.
- It's not infinite. It's just...

33
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,108
it's exponentially large.

34
00:03:05,233 --> 00:03:07,286
You couldn't have played
through them all.

35
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:10,102
There's an average
of 40 moves per chess game,

36
00:03:10,227 --> 00:03:13,011
and I'll tell you something the more
I played, the more I realized that

37
00:03:13,136 --> 00:03:15,720
every single match,
every single chess game,

38
00:03:15,845 --> 00:03:19,394
is really just a simple variation
on the exact same theme.

39
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:20,466
You know?

40
00:03:20,591 --> 00:03:23,911
It's aggressive opening, patient
mid-game, inevitable checkmate,

41
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:26,372
and I realized why my friend quit.

42
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,850
He was tired of repeating
the exsame patterns

43
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:30,584
and expecting a different outcome.

44
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,990
So you have a lifetime
of chess strategy in your head

45
00:03:34,115 --> 00:03:36,674
- and you're just sitting on it.
- I still use it.

46
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:38,812
I just, uh...
I apply it differently.

47
00:03:38,937 --> 00:03:40,300
I have to go.

48
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:42,709
It was good seeing you.

49
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:46,260
Rita Stuart, 25,

50
00:03:46,385 --> 00:03:48,314
second victim in Atlantic City.

51
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:50,584
Pretty public spot for a dump site.

52
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:53,698
You know, technically, I think it
would qualify more as a disposal site.

53
00:03:53,823 --> 00:03:56,360
You don't leave a body on a
merry-go-round out of convenience.

54
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,480
He took some time with her
appearance, didn't he?

55
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:01,198
Her nails were polished, her hair
was cut, clothes were brand-new.

56
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,742
Wants her to look her best when found.
That's a lot of remorse.

57
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,525
- Who is victim number one?
- Stacia Jackson, 29.

58
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:10,030
- She was found at a local playground.
- A change in victimology.

59
00:04:10,155 --> 00:04:11,918
What's the connection
between these women?

60
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:14,359
There is none. Rita was married,
Stacia was single.

61
00:04:14,484 --> 00:04:16,589
Rita worked at a diner,
Stacia was a corporate lawyer.

62
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:20,092
According to their credit cards, they
never came within 10 miles of each other.

63
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,927
Both women were taken 2 months ago?

64
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,055
Yeah. They lived such
completely different lives,

65
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,557
the police didn't tie their
abduction together until now.

66
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,634
Was there any evidence
of sexual assault?

67
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:30,936
There was no evidence
of violence of any kind.

68
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,525
So how did they die?

69
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,947
Rita had a stroke,
Stacia had a brain hemorrhage.

70
00:04:35,072 --> 00:04:37,193
Look at this, the unsub gave
them a battery of drugs...

71
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:39,639
Atracurium, Doxacurium.
These are neural inhibitors.

72
00:04:39,764 --> 00:04:41,822
They block signals from
the brain to the muscles.

73
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,008
He put them in medical comas
for 2 months.

74
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:46,705
Actually, they weren't in a coma.
You'd need phenobarbital

75
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,413
to keep them unconscious,
and they didn't have that.

76
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:52,499
So, wait a minute. These victims were
paralyzed but they were still conscious?

77
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:55,669
They could open their eyes, hear,
probably even feel stimulation.

78
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,342
Physical immobility
but mental awareness.

79
00:04:58,467 --> 00:05:01,318
This unsub wants total
domination over them.

80
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,970
And he turns their bodies
into prisons to do it.

81
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,241
Mildred Lisette Norman wrote,

82
00:06:10,366 --> 00:06:12,379
"Anything you cannot relinquish

83
00:06:12,504 --> 00:06:14,509
"when it has outlived
its usefulness,

84
00:06:14,634 --> 00:06:16,037
"possesses you,

85
00:06:16,162 --> 00:06:18,048
"and in this materialistic age,

86
00:06:18,173 --> 00:06:22,051
a great many of us are
possessed by our possessions."

87
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:27,118
Keeping women in a conscious
paralysis reads as sadism.

88
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,508
Definitely dehumanizing,
reducing them to objects.

89
00:06:30,633 --> 00:06:33,700
But there's nothing else about this
profile that takes us down that path.

90
00:06:33,825 --> 00:06:35,852
These women were found
in excellent condition.

91
00:06:35,977 --> 00:06:39,032
There was no evidence of bed sores,
they were well fed through an I.V.

92
00:06:39,157 --> 00:06:40,873
His access to I.V.S and drugs...

93
00:06:40,998 --> 00:06:42,854
he almost certainly
has medical training.

94
00:06:42,979 --> 00:06:44,737
Are we sure this is a he?

95
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,197
The care this unsub
shows these victims,

96
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,358
although they are dehumanized,

97
00:06:49,483 --> 00:06:52,154
- the profile says female.
- What about the postmortem posing?

98
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:54,755
That's a lot of dead weight
for a woman to carry.

99
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,566
These women are petite.
They're under 100 pounds.

100
00:06:57,691 --> 00:07:00,460
All right, if we reconsider the gender
of the profile, what changes?

101
00:07:00,585 --> 00:07:02,671
Nothing.
If anything, it fits better.

102
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:06,216
Men kill to fulfill a sexual
compulsion. Women don't.

103
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:09,511
You see this in angel of mercy killers,
like Genene Jones and Amy Archer.

104
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,364
They didn't care about race
or hair color. It's men that do.

105
00:07:12,489 --> 00:07:14,076
Damn straight.
Men do.

106
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:16,992
Well, hello, red.
Look at you. Guys.

107
00:07:18,467 --> 00:07:20,167
What did you find
out about the clothing

108
00:07:20,292 --> 00:07:21,946
the unsub's dressing the victims in?

109
00:07:22,071 --> 00:07:24,338
At first only that both
garments were made from chiffon,

110
00:07:24,463 --> 00:07:26,755
but with the wonder twin powers
of the Atlantic City police

111
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,388
and my impeccable eye for fashion,

112
00:07:28,513 --> 00:07:31,841
we have also determined that these
garments fit ridiculously well.

113
00:07:31,966 --> 00:07:35,278
They're super flattering to each
victim's exact measurements,

114
00:07:35,403 --> 00:07:37,790
kind of exactly like the unsub
whipped them up herself.

115
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,905
Maybe that's what
connects the victims.

116
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:40,872
How so?

117
00:07:40,997 --> 00:07:43,212
Maybe she isn't just
killing petite women

118
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,541
because they're easier
to abduct and pose

119
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,331
but because of a physical type.

120
00:07:47,456 --> 00:07:48,801
She wants a body type.

121
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,386
Sewing clothes for a specific size
of woman.

122
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:54,868
Please tell me she is not killing these
women because she needs human models.

123
00:07:54,993 --> 00:07:56,944
I mean, there's gotta
be more to it than that.

124
00:07:57,069 --> 00:07:58,217
There probably is.

125
00:07:58,342 --> 00:08:00,463
But at least we have
a start on the victimology.

126
00:08:00,588 --> 00:08:03,149
Prentiss and Morgan, I want you
to interview the victims' families.

127
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,049
Talk to them
about lifestyle choices.

128
00:08:05,174 --> 00:08:07,505
Any body image issues
these women may have had.

129
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,446
Reid, go to Rita Stuart's autopsy,

130
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:13,424
see if the drugs point to any specific
medical training the unsub might have had.

131
00:08:13,549 --> 00:08:15,351
Dave and I will go
to the disposal site.

132
00:08:15,476 --> 00:08:16,218
Sir.

133
00:08:16,343 --> 00:08:18,791
I want you to check missing persons
reports for the last 2 months.

134
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,903
See if any abductions
match what we know.

135
00:08:21,028 --> 00:08:23,783
We need to find out if the unsub's
already taken another victim.

136
00:08:30,785 --> 00:08:32,859
- Agent Jareau?
- Detective Marty Cotrone.

137
00:08:32,984 --> 00:08:35,848
Hi. These are ssas
Morgan and Prentiss.

138
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,434
- Were you able to contact the families?
- They're already here.

139
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,344
Did they bring the pictures
we asked for?

140
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:43,055
Yeah.
They were pretty confused by that.

141
00:08:43,494 --> 00:08:44,982
And to be honest, so am I.

142
00:08:46,449 --> 00:08:48,430
Agent Morgan, I don't understand.

143
00:08:48,555 --> 00:08:50,523
How does what my daughter
looked like have to do

144
00:08:50,648 --> 00:08:52,108
with the monster who killed her?

145
00:08:52,233 --> 00:08:54,658
We think the unsub is
looking for a physical type.

146
00:08:55,298 --> 00:08:57,119
Fit but petite.

147
00:08:57,634 --> 00:08:59,747
This is her.
This is my wife.

148
00:09:00,823 --> 00:09:03,168
Did Rita work out, stay in shape?

149
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:04,750
Sure.
I guess.

150
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,188
She went to the gym
at least 3 times a week.

151
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:09,798
Stacia took pride in every
aspect of her appearance.

152
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,967
- In what way?
- You know, her clothes.

153
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:13,776
It was her clothes.
She loved to shop.

154
00:09:13,901 --> 00:09:16,301
It looks like she has kind
of a bohemian streak going on.

155
00:09:16,426 --> 00:09:17,133
Yeah.

156
00:09:17,258 --> 00:09:19,391
What were her favorite
places to shop?

157
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:21,203
High-end boutiques.

158
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:23,175
- Expensive ones?
- Certainly.

159
00:09:25,221 --> 00:09:27,248
- And dressed to fit.
- She was tiny.

160
00:09:27,373 --> 00:09:29,972
Everything had to be taken in
so she'd look...

161
00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:31,580
Her best.

162
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:34,864
Would you mind writing down
some of her favorite places to go?

163
00:09:34,989 --> 00:09:37,993
So these are mostly
consignment and thrift shops?

164
00:09:38,484 --> 00:09:40,201
That's really all we could afford.

165
00:09:40,326 --> 00:09:42,842
Did she ever have
these clothes altered?

166
00:09:43,191 --> 00:09:44,833
Tailored to fit her better?

167
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,839
I never really paid attention.

168
00:09:47,184 --> 00:09:48,946
Would she ever...

169
00:09:49,331 --> 00:09:51,089
have worn something like that?

170
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,054
Would she ever wear
anything like that?

171
00:09:57,623 --> 00:09:58,673
No.

172
00:10:14,551 --> 00:10:15,572
Dave!

173
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,830
- Can you hear that?
- Yeah.

174
00:10:18,955 --> 00:10:20,703
She's posing her victims in a place

175
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:22,933
that represents innocence
and childhood.

176
00:10:23,058 --> 00:10:26,625
Most serial killers don't have
a particularly happy childhood.

177
00:10:27,095 --> 00:10:30,569
My guess is she wants them to have
the fun she never got to have.

178
00:10:30,694 --> 00:10:32,874
Let's think about how she's
doing this practically.

179
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,334
How's she getting them
from her car to the carousel?

180
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:37,854
She's moving a body
in the middle of the night.

181
00:10:37,979 --> 00:10:41,014
She needs to make conditions
as favorable as possible.

182
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,216
So she'd need a vehicle
that afforded her privacy...

183
00:10:43,341 --> 00:10:44,740
a van or an SUV.

184
00:10:44,865 --> 00:10:47,424
That's still a lot of ground
to cover once she parks.

185
00:10:47,549 --> 00:10:49,071
Even if these women are light,

186
00:10:49,196 --> 00:10:51,441
she risks getting caught
carrying a corpse.

187
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,180
If she has a medical background,
what if she used a wheelchair,

188
00:10:54,305 --> 00:10:56,439
something that would help
her move them quickly?

189
00:10:56,564 --> 00:10:58,801
And if she has a wheelchair,

190
00:10:58,926 --> 00:11:00,789
that means her van has a lift,

191
00:11:00,914 --> 00:11:03,502
which would be helpful
to unload a body.

192
00:11:03,782 --> 00:11:07,457
Which also means she has
a handicap placard.

193
00:11:08,683 --> 00:11:11,249
Which would give her
the closest place to park.

194
00:11:11,374 --> 00:11:14,243
I'll have Garcia pull all vehicles
with handicap registrations.

195
00:11:14,475 --> 00:11:15,572
Thanks, Dave.

196
00:11:16,054 --> 00:11:17,968
Once I have the knees bent,

197
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:20,123
I can get leverage under her.

198
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,585
Normally, an assistant helps me.

199
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,826
But I can do it
by myself if I need to.

200
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:28,057
I'm assuming the unsub would
have this training, too.

201
00:11:28,182 --> 00:11:30,315
Let me ask you this is there
anything specific about it?

202
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,530
No, any caregiver out
there can do this...

203
00:11:32,655 --> 00:11:34,430
Docs, nurses, orderlies.

204
00:11:34,555 --> 00:11:37,029
Where do you think she's getting
the drugs that she's using?

205
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:40,579
Do you think she could be manipulating
a doctor or a pharmacist, maybe?

206
00:11:40,704 --> 00:11:42,931
He'd be criminally
negligent if she was.

207
00:11:43,056 --> 00:11:45,538
But it is possible.
I mean, doctors order things

208
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,725
through residents,
nurses forge signatures,

209
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,479
prescriptions fall through cracks.

210
00:11:49,604 --> 00:11:52,008
That's a lot of drugs
and a lot of cracks.

211
00:11:52,133 --> 00:11:54,354
She keeps these women
paralyzed for 2 months.

212
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:57,242
Your report said both of them
had hair extensions clipped in.

213
00:11:57,367 --> 00:12:00,449
Yes, to hide the fact that clumps
of their real hair had fallen out.

214
00:12:00,574 --> 00:12:03,654
But if they were fed through I.V.S,
that wasn't from malnutrition, right?

215
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:06,092
You see this a lot
in bedridden patients.

216
00:12:06,217 --> 00:12:09,573
Loss of motor function.
Especially in a young woman like this.

217
00:12:09,698 --> 00:12:11,076
Of course.
Psychic shock.

218
00:12:11,201 --> 00:12:13,552
Yeah, the mental effects
take a physical toll.

219
00:12:13,677 --> 00:12:15,786
One last question in
your professional opinion,

220
00:12:15,911 --> 00:12:18,886
do you think the hair extensions were
clipped on before or after death?

221
00:12:19,011 --> 00:12:19,881
Before.

222
00:12:19,854 --> 00:12:21,451
And you seem pretty
certain of that?

223
00:12:21,478 --> 00:12:24,191
You know the old wives' tale
about your hair and nails

224
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:25,435
growing after death.

225
00:12:25,555 --> 00:12:27,589
What's really happening
is that dehydration

226
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:29,569
is shrinking your skin,
pulling it back.

227
00:12:29,941 --> 00:12:32,069
Based on where
she put these extensions,

228
00:12:32,189 --> 00:12:34,076
they were definitely still alive.

229
00:12:34,133 --> 00:12:36,330
Now, we know this unsub is
stuck in a rich fantasy, right?

230
00:12:36,396 --> 00:12:38,903
An incredibly detailed delusion.
We don't know what the delusion is,

231
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,939
but we know that it involves
remaking these women,

232
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:43,066
and it begins the moment
she has them drugged.

233
00:12:43,186 --> 00:12:45,608
So she has them paralyzed
and she can do whatever she wants,

234
00:12:45,646 --> 00:12:47,972
- why is she killing them?
- Well, I don't think she means to.

235
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,210
The brain is a machine
designed to respond to stimuli.

236
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,350
If you keep the brain awake
but the body immobile,

237
00:12:52,387 --> 00:12:53,861
it breaks down, loses its hair.

238
00:12:53,889 --> 00:12:55,767
After 2 months,
it eventually strokes out.

239
00:12:55,802 --> 00:12:58,865
So death isn't this unsub's goal,
it's an unfortunate side effect.

240
00:12:58,985 --> 00:12:59,814
Exactly.

241
00:13:00,095 --> 00:13:01,467
What'd you find out?

242
00:13:01,543 --> 00:13:03,815
Both Rita Stuart and Stacia Jackson
were clothes hounds,

243
00:13:03,862 --> 00:13:06,609
but because they were petite women,
they had a lot of their stuff altered.

244
00:13:06,654 --> 00:13:08,369
Could be how our unsub
is finding her victims.

245
00:13:08,393 --> 00:13:10,036
She gets her hands
on their measurements.

246
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:12,728
But we already exhausted tailors,
alteration shops. There's no overlap.

247
00:13:12,848 --> 00:13:15,269
The tailors might send specialty
items out to third parties.

248
00:13:15,309 --> 00:13:17,056
Dig deep into extended
employment records

249
00:13:17,084 --> 00:13:19,000
and see who they might
be subcontracting to.

250
00:13:19,055 --> 00:13:20,340
Garcia needs to talk to us.

251
00:13:20,794 --> 00:13:21,825
Go ahead, Garcia.

252
00:13:21,863 --> 00:13:24,292
Hello, my pretties. I have
finished my missing persons sweep.

253
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,014
I've got nothing on the medical vehicle,

254
00:13:26,134 --> 00:13:29,064
but 2 new matches on the clothes
make the woman front.

255
00:13:29,425 --> 00:13:32,464
Cindy Admundson. she was abducted
outside a thrift store,

256
00:13:32,584 --> 00:13:35,314
and maxine wynan was last
seen at the hillridge mall.

257
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:36,728
That sounds like our girl.

258
00:13:36,785 --> 00:13:38,537
Any surveillance footage at the mall?

259
00:13:38,925 --> 00:13:41,414
No. It was an outside parking lot.
So sorry.

260
00:13:41,475 --> 00:13:43,531
The new abductees
what's their physical type?

261
00:13:43,567 --> 00:13:44,919
They look pretty tiny to me.

262
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:47,313
I'm gonna send you pictures.
Also, if it pleases the court,

263
00:13:47,433 --> 00:13:49,547
I would like to direct
your attention to exhibit "a,"

264
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:50,724
the calendar map.

265
00:13:51,112 --> 00:13:52,129
What about it?

266
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:54,871
Both of these new victims
were abducted one week ago,

267
00:13:54,991 --> 00:13:58,309
exactly one day before
the bodies of Rita Stuart

268
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,958
and Stacia Jackson, respectively,
turned up.

269
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:03,531
She doesn't let a body go
until she has a replacement.

270
00:14:05,239 --> 00:14:06,799
Thank you so much.

271
00:14:20,549 --> 00:14:21,524
Excuse me.

272
00:14:22,596 --> 00:14:23,865
Do you need some help?

273
00:14:23,973 --> 00:14:25,119
the ramp's broken.

274
00:14:25,175 --> 00:14:26,636
You want me to call a tow truck?

275
00:14:26,663 --> 00:14:28,442
I just need to get
the chair in the van,

276
00:14:28,562 --> 00:14:29,806
and then I can go home.

277
00:14:29,999 --> 00:14:31,343
Well, we could load it.

278
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:32,241
You think?

279
00:14:32,361 --> 00:14:33,949
Sure.
We'll put it in the back?

280
00:14:34,246 --> 00:14:36,013
Go on in.
You pull, I'll lift.

281
00:14:36,133 --> 00:14:37,026
Ok.

282
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:41,336
one, two

283
00:14:42,005 --> 00:14:43,306
three

284
00:14:45,938 --> 00:14:48,707
Do we need to lock the wheels
or anything like that?

285
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:03,721
You're so pretty.

286
00:15:10,823 --> 00:15:12,187
Victim is mary newsome.

287
00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:13,993
Abducted 2 months ago.

288
00:15:15,298 --> 00:15:17,351
She was found on this bench
first thing this morning.

289
00:15:17,753 --> 00:15:19,633
Ok, well, it looks like her style.

290
00:15:19,634 --> 00:15:21,445
It's chiffon, and it's sewn to fit.

291
00:15:21,565 --> 00:15:24,776
If she's disposed of this body, it
means she's recently taken a new victim.

292
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:28,444
We'll call hotch, we'll comb through missing
persons reports from the last 48 hours.

293
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:29,511
I'll pulling them.

294
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:30,327
Thank you.

295
00:15:33,564 --> 00:15:34,671
What?

296
00:15:35,812 --> 00:15:37,324
These aren't hair extensions.

297
00:15:37,698 --> 00:15:39,276
Maybe her hair was too brittle.

298
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:40,882
Maybe.
I don't know.

299
00:15:41,672 --> 00:15:43,305
You know what?
This is a wig.

300
00:15:43,384 --> 00:15:44,685
Kanekalon, I think.

301
00:15:44,805 --> 00:15:45,910
What's that?

302
00:15:45,993 --> 00:15:47,954
Synthetic hair.
There's nothing special about it.

303
00:15:47,998 --> 00:15:50,220
It's used in wigs all over the world.

304
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,258
But look at this.

305
00:15:54,594 --> 00:15:55,745
Are those stitches?

306
00:15:56,199 --> 00:15:57,149
On her scalp.

307
00:15:58,674 --> 00:15:59,878
She sewed this in.

308
00:17:10,767 --> 00:17:12,466
Yeah. Wallace.
I got it. Thank you.

309
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:15,864
Hey, I think we found who
was taken last night.

310
00:17:16,239 --> 00:17:18,056
Her name is Bethany Wallace.

311
00:17:18,231 --> 00:17:20,475
Her husband says she never came
home from the dry cleaners

312
00:17:20,522 --> 00:17:22,412
where she stopped off
to pick up some clothes.

313
00:17:22,432 --> 00:17:23,868
Anybody at the cleaners see anything?

314
00:17:23,903 --> 00:17:26,063
The employees were busy locking up.
But they did mention

315
00:17:26,071 --> 00:17:27,969
that they do farm out work
to tailors who work from home.

316
00:17:27,997 --> 00:17:30,553
Good. We can match records based
on who worked on Bethany's clothes.

317
00:17:30,673 --> 00:17:33,609
We just got the pictures of
the 2 recent abductions from Garcia.

318
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:35,277
Line up the photos of the new victims

319
00:17:35,278 --> 00:17:38,459
next to the bodies they replaced.
That might help us with the timeline.

320
00:17:51,155 --> 00:17:52,323
You guys see this?

321
00:17:52,586 --> 00:17:55,610
Yeah. She's matching up
the victims physically one to one.

322
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:56,813
She's a collector.

323
00:17:57,729 --> 00:17:59,948
We're ready to give the profile.

324
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:02,244
The unsub we're looking for is a woman.

325
00:18:02,272 --> 00:18:03,328
She's a collector.

326
00:18:03,448 --> 00:18:05,723
It's a psychopathology
similar to hoarding.

327
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:06,980
So when we say collector,

328
00:18:07,008 --> 00:18:09,025
we're not talking about
stamps or baseball cards.

329
00:18:09,145 --> 00:18:12,116
It's not what your kids, or even you,

330
00:18:12,236 --> 00:18:13,735
might pursue as a normal hobby.

331
00:18:13,855 --> 00:18:16,517
This is an attachment to objects
that's become obsessive,

332
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,687
by someone who is antisocial
and extremely introverted.

333
00:18:20,503 --> 00:18:23,932
These people attach a part of
themselves to their collection.

334
00:18:24,052 --> 00:18:26,924
If you try to separate them from it
or take it away from them,

335
00:18:27,044 --> 00:18:29,546
they will react violently,
even psychotically.

336
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,671
They've suffered damage
to their prefrontal cortex.

337
00:18:31,717 --> 00:18:33,524
That's the part of the brain
that regulates

338
00:18:33,562 --> 00:18:35,061
basic freudian fantasy/reality.

339
00:18:35,062 --> 00:18:38,670
They can still function, like drive a
car, go to work, even do their taxes

340
00:18:39,205 --> 00:18:41,872
In fact, she excels
at goal-oriented jobs,

341
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:43,660
like the precision of sewing.

342
00:18:44,007 --> 00:18:45,479
Or the details of abduction.

343
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:48,079
But they've lost their ability
to categorize the difference

344
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,576
between living and dead,
uh, belonging and loss.

345
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,396
That has been irreparably destroyed.

346
00:18:52,971 --> 00:18:54,496
So, what's she collecting, women?

347
00:18:54,957 --> 00:18:55,746
Actually,

348
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:57,941
we think she's collecting dolls.

349
00:18:58,061 --> 00:18:59,613
Technically, replacing them.

350
00:18:59,733 --> 00:19:01,559
We believe that
she lost the originals

351
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,528
sometime within the last 3 months,

352
00:19:03,787 --> 00:19:05,981
and this is what served
as her stress room.

353
00:19:06,101 --> 00:19:08,481
She searched for a replacement,
and when she couldn't find them,

354
00:19:08,601 --> 00:19:11,784
she started abducting
the closest possible surrogate.

355
00:19:11,904 --> 00:19:15,055
Women of different ethnicities
but of similar physicality.

356
00:19:16,002 --> 00:19:18,409
The drug-induced parasis
is part of the fantasy.

357
00:19:19,065 --> 00:19:21,552
She puts her victims in a position
where they can't talk back

358
00:19:21,672 --> 00:19:24,214
so she can fetishize them
like the objects she's lost.

359
00:19:25,277 --> 00:19:25,933
Look.

360
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:30,027
I respect your analysis,
but this woman kidnapped 6 women

361
00:19:30,147 --> 00:19:31,728
and killed 3 of them.

362
00:19:31,832 --> 00:19:33,759
And you're telling us
this is about dolls?

363
00:19:33,879 --> 00:19:38,093
This unsub stitched a wig onto
the scalp of her latest victim.

364
00:19:38,213 --> 00:19:41,264
It's a technique used
to attach hair to porcelain dolls.

365
00:19:41,384 --> 00:19:43,619
And keep in mind,
collectors and serial killers

366
00:19:43,739 --> 00:19:44,956
do share certain traits.

367
00:19:45,076 --> 00:19:48,395
A lot of serial killerstake tro,
attaching the same significance

368
00:19:48,515 --> 00:19:50,495
to them that this collector
does to objects.

369
00:19:50,615 --> 00:19:52,529
But this unsub's
intent isn't violence.

370
00:19:52,864 --> 00:19:55,259
She needs this collection
to be complete

371
00:19:55,379 --> 00:19:57,319
so sheaneel in control of her life,

372
00:19:57,439 --> 00:20:00,664
probably to overcome some
trauma she experienced.

373
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:03,837
She really only feels that control
when the collection is complete,

374
00:20:03,884 --> 00:20:06,478
which is why she's repeating an
abduction pattern with living victims.

375
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,330
If she loses a doll, or in this case,

376
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,350
if she loses a woman
who represents a doll,

377
00:20:10,883 --> 00:20:12,156
she has to replace it.

378
00:20:12,276 --> 00:20:14,992
This woman works alone.
We know she has medical training.

379
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,346
Look for nurse's aides or orderlies

380
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,672
who we fired for a lack
of social grace

381
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,162
she can't fake a bedside manner.

382
00:20:22,978 --> 00:20:26,776
We believe she's currently working
as a tailor or a seamstress,

383
00:20:26,749 --> 00:20:29,598
and we're following those leads now.
But do let us know

384
00:20:29,718 --> 00:20:32,051
if you notice any overlap
in your suspect pools.

385
00:20:32,821 --> 00:20:33,760
Thank you.

386
00:20:33,811 --> 00:20:35,578
Of course I remember Ms. Jackson.

387
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,869
We were all sad to hear
what happened.

388
00:20:37,973 --> 00:20:39,913
Do you ever farm
out tailoring jobs,

389
00:20:40,033 --> 00:20:42,642
someone who might have done this?

390
00:20:43,752 --> 00:20:44,568
No.

391
00:20:45,812 --> 00:20:47,110
To be perfectly honest,

392
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,291
we wouldn't even sell
something so dated.

393
00:20:49,411 --> 00:20:50,968
Let me take a look.

394
00:20:55,873 --> 00:20:57,157
Where did you get this?

395
00:20:57,277 --> 00:20:58,656
Why?
Did you see something?

396
00:20:58,776 --> 00:20:59,980
Look at this lockstitch.

397
00:21:00,662 --> 00:21:02,013
It's a handkerchief pattern.

398
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:05,679
You see this on
silk-sewn handkerchiefs.

399
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,967
And it's all done by hand.

400
00:21:08,944 --> 00:21:11,085
So this is her signature?
This is unique to her.

401
00:21:11,205 --> 00:21:13,506
I couldn't do it,
not even with a machine.

402
00:21:13,626 --> 00:21:16,984
If there someplace that specializes
in handcrafted sewing like this?

403
00:21:17,973 --> 00:21:19,606
I'll tell you this much, though.

404
00:21:19,672 --> 00:21:21,130
She's been at it a long time.

405
00:21:21,638 --> 00:21:22,588
This woman...

406
00:21:23,364 --> 00:21:24,327
is an artist.

407
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,096
Hotch, this is Bethany Wallace's sband karl.

408
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,902
We brought him in for questioning.

409
00:21:32,921 --> 00:21:34,260
Do you know where my wife is?

410
00:21:34,272 --> 00:21:35,434
We're searching for her, sir.

411
00:21:35,472 --> 00:21:37,518
No. You have to find her
in the next 24 hours.

412
00:21:37,638 --> 00:21:38,896
Bethany is a diabetic.

413
00:21:39,016 --> 00:21:41,157
Look, agent Prentiss said
that the woman who took her

414
00:21:41,177 --> 00:21:42,365
has medical training.

415
00:21:42,421 --> 00:21:44,791
So... Bethany could have a chance?

416
00:21:47,699 --> 00:21:48,400
What?

417
00:21:48,434 --> 00:21:50,481
She keeps her victims
in a drug-induced state.

418
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:51,872
They can't communicate.

419
00:21:54,588 --> 00:21:56,568
These...
These drugs, will they...

420
00:21:56,688 --> 00:21:57,918
we don't know.

421
00:21:58,026 --> 00:21:59,634
But we're doing everything we can.

422
00:22:36,607 --> 00:22:39,069
Everyone, this is Sally.

423
00:22:39,189 --> 00:22:40,342
Be nice to her.

424
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:09,288
So, doctor, if a diabetic were given

425
00:24:09,408 --> 00:24:11,281
this battery of drugs
to keep her paralyzed,

426
00:24:11,401 --> 00:24:13,006
what would the reaction be?

427
00:24:14,331 --> 00:24:17,071
Diabetics metabolize everything
they consume differently...

428
00:24:17,502 --> 00:24:18,919
Food, drinks, drugs.

429
00:24:19,601 --> 00:24:21,241
It all gets broken
down to blood sugar

430
00:24:21,361 --> 00:24:22,505
at varying rates.

431
00:24:23,147 --> 00:24:26,090
Most likely, this patient seized up

432
00:24:26,358 --> 00:24:28,236
minutes after she was medicated.

433
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:30,237
So she's already dead.

434
00:24:31,601 --> 00:24:32,703
Probably.

435
00:24:33,622 --> 00:24:34,465
Although...

436
00:24:34,822 --> 00:24:36,364
there is another possibility.

437
00:24:38,117 --> 00:24:40,699
Bethany's condition could
break down the drugs

438
00:24:40,819 --> 00:24:42,595
faster than the other victims.

439
00:24:42,715 --> 00:24:44,330
She could regain control of her body?

440
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:47,500
Every hour that she doesn't
turn up is a reason for hope.

441
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:49,580
We're still running out of time.

442
00:24:49,608 --> 00:24:51,101
If the drugs don't kill Bethany,

443
00:24:51,135 --> 00:24:53,193
she's not gonna last
long without insulin.

444
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:57,771
Look, collectors are good,
honest people.

445
00:24:57,834 --> 00:25:00,398
Just because you enjoy dolls doesn't
make you a freak or a pedophile.

446
00:25:00,433 --> 00:25:02,839
We appreciate that, sir, but the
woman that we're looking for

447
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,777
has lost her ability
to control her obsession.

448
00:25:04,778 --> 00:25:07,519
She's killed 3 women trying
to recreate a type of doll

449
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,714
she had as a child.

450
00:25:09,006 --> 00:25:10,221
Describe the line to me.

451
00:25:10,222 --> 00:25:11,949
Well, there's a pattern to the victims.

452
00:25:12,015 --> 00:25:13,947
They're in their 20s,
and they're petite.

453
00:25:14,305 --> 00:25:16,887
Most doll lines revolve
around infants.

454
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:19,134
Is she dressing them like babies?

455
00:25:19,254 --> 00:25:20,267
No, she's not.

456
00:25:20,387 --> 00:25:22,291
Their wardrobe consists
of chiffon dresses,

457
00:25:22,411 --> 00:25:24,675
worn by one blond woman,
a redhead, and a black woman.

458
00:25:24,953 --> 00:25:27,147
The dresses...
is she sewing them herself?

459
00:25:29,716 --> 00:25:31,348
How did you know that?

460
00:25:32,512 --> 00:25:34,129
It's the valois line.

461
00:25:34,411 --> 00:25:38,251
Local company,
back in the late eighties.

462
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:40,551
Probably when our
unsub was prepubescent.

463
00:25:44,243 --> 00:25:46,558
They promoted feminism
and multiculturalism.

464
00:25:46,852 --> 00:25:49,221
Strong, independent girls
from different backgrounds

465
00:25:49,341 --> 00:25:50,652
who could still be friends.

466
00:25:52,632 --> 00:25:54,901
Reid.
Birth certificate to fill out.

467
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,862
A form to describe their lives.
And a kit to sew your own clothes.

468
00:25:57,982 --> 00:25:59,639
JJ said she's been at it for a while.

469
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,942
She's probably been sewing
since she was a little kid.

470
00:26:02,304 --> 00:26:04,543
Wait a minute. Sir,
what's this contest that they held?

471
00:26:04,779 --> 00:26:07,812
That was to see who could come up
with the most imaginative doll.

472
00:26:08,043 --> 00:26:10,384
Sew a dress.
Write an essay to describe her.

473
00:26:10,504 --> 00:26:13,785
If you won the contest, you'd have
your doll featured in next year's line.

474
00:26:13,786 --> 00:26:15,487
I assume that didn't
end well, did it?

475
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:17,206
No, it did not.

476
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:19,627
It's a classic tool
child psychologists use.

477
00:26:20,109 --> 00:26:21,695
Tell me a story with these dolls.

478
00:26:21,696 --> 00:26:24,870
When the company got essays
with thinly-veiled references

479
00:26:24,871 --> 00:26:26,306
To physical or sexual abuse,

480
00:26:26,426 --> 00:26:29,152
they turned the entry forms
and the dolls over to the police.

481
00:26:29,318 --> 00:26:30,731
The publicity killed the line.

482
00:26:30,851 --> 00:26:32,796
You said the company was local, right?

483
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,146
They might still have
the clothes in evidence.

484
00:28:10,262 --> 00:28:11,493
How are the essays going?

485
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:14,836
Makes for some pretty depressing reading.

486
00:28:15,065 --> 00:28:16,991
Prentiss is having a good time.

487
00:28:20,336 --> 00:28:22,624
These dolls are all like
little time capsules,

488
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:25,231
only the eighties fashion
wasn't so kind to them.

489
00:28:25,861 --> 00:28:28,503
I'm surprised how many little girls
knew how to make shoulder pads.

490
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:29,873
How's it going on your end?

491
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:32,926
I got a list of vendors
the victims went to...

492
00:28:33,046 --> 00:28:35,428
tailors, seamstresses, that sort of thing.

493
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:38,022
Hey, JJ, you said something
about a handkerchief hem, right?

494
00:28:40,992 --> 00:28:43,319
That's exactly like what
she sews for her victims.

495
00:28:43,439 --> 00:28:44,885
What's the name on the entry?

496
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,836
Samantha Malcolm.

497
00:28:46,956 --> 00:28:48,204
She's on my list.

498
00:28:48,603 --> 00:28:51,381
Wait a minute, guys. I have her
essay around here somewhere.

499
00:28:51,827 --> 00:28:52,683
Right here.

500
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:56,202
"sally doesn't like the
room with the lightning."

501
00:28:57,954 --> 00:28:59,060
That can't be good.

502
00:28:59,064 --> 00:29:01,955
Ok, guys, I just got Samantha
Malcolm's medical records, and...

503
00:29:02,771 --> 00:29:04,519
Oh, my god, she was doomed.

504
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,288
Like emily bronte doomed,

505
00:29:06,289 --> 00:29:07,787
like shakespeare doomed,

506
00:29:07,907 --> 00:29:10,158
like red-shirted ensign
in "Star Trek" doomed.

507
00:29:10,278 --> 00:29:11,561
What happened to her?

508
00:29:11,613 --> 00:29:13,117
Oh, uh sorry, uh,

509
00:29:13,183 --> 00:29:14,928
well, for the first 10 years, nothing,

510
00:29:14,929 --> 00:29:18,517
and then she started a battery
of electroshock treatments.

511
00:29:18,905 --> 00:29:21,340
At 10?
Who subjects a child to ect?

512
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,640
That would be her father,
Dr. Arthur Malcolm.

513
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,436
He runs an inpatient
mental health facility

514
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:28,774
for troubled young
people called new lives.

515
00:29:28,775 --> 00:29:31,439
At first, the essay that
Samantha wrote raised some flags,

516
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:33,646
but her father explained
that the therapy

517
00:29:33,745 --> 00:29:35,646
was to deal with the
recent death of her mother.

518
00:29:35,647 --> 00:29:37,512
After that, he started her

519
00:29:37,513 --> 00:29:39,644
on a serious regimen
of anti-psychotic drugs,

520
00:29:39,645 --> 00:29:41,724
which he weaned her off
of a few years ago.

521
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,639
It explains her familiarity
with medication.

522
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:44,804
Where is she now?

523
00:29:45,071 --> 00:29:46,818
Uh, her father declared
her incompetent,

524
00:29:46,847 --> 00:29:48,377
so he's still the legal guardian.

525
00:29:48,421 --> 00:29:49,787
Everything is in his name.

526
00:29:49,836 --> 00:29:52,457
And all of her records list
new lives as her residence.

527
00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:55,892
She couldn't keep victims
in an inpatient facility.

528
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,265
She needs privacy.

529
00:29:57,331 --> 00:30:00,113
Garcia, what about real estate
holdings in her father's name?

530
00:30:00,254 --> 00:30:02,300
Just his own.
But new lives has

531
00:30:02,357 --> 00:30:05,431
a bunch of outpatient and
halfway houses all over town.

532
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:06,718
JJ, where does she work?

533
00:30:06,774 --> 00:30:08,775
I have her placed at 3
different shops around town.

534
00:30:08,831 --> 00:30:11,356
All right, let's split up and
cover the shops and the facility.

535
00:30:11,403 --> 00:30:12,652
I want to go to new lives.

536
00:30:12,689 --> 00:30:14,875
Whether or not she's there,
I want to talk to the father.

537
00:30:14,878 --> 00:30:17,357
There are literally hundreds of
therapies to help kids through loss.

538
00:30:17,376 --> 00:30:18,803
Electroshock is not one of them.

539
00:30:18,831 --> 00:30:19,842
Take Rossi.

540
00:30:24,004 --> 00:30:25,507
Be nice to each other.

541
00:30:26,521 --> 00:30:27,694
See you later.

542
00:30:59,712 --> 00:31:01,122
We're leaving.

543
00:31:25,198 --> 00:31:26,146
Phone...

544
00:32:03,251 --> 00:32:04,847
No... No.

545
00:33:04,278 --> 00:33:06,006
I am very confused, gentlemen.

546
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,789
What does this have
to do with Samantha?

547
00:33:07,836 --> 00:33:09,548
We need to talk to her.
Is she here?

548
00:33:09,549 --> 00:33:10,783
No, she's at work.

549
00:33:10,838 --> 00:33:12,153
Does she live here,

550
00:33:12,172 --> 00:33:14,294
or did you move her into
one of your halfway houses?

551
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:16,303
As a matter of fact,
she is in one of my houses.

552
00:33:16,354 --> 00:33:17,773
Well, we'll need the address.

553
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,069
And I'll need to know what this is about.

554
00:33:20,144 --> 00:33:22,992
She might be tied
to a series of abductions.

555
00:33:23,059 --> 00:33:24,993
That's not possible.
It's not my daughter.

556
00:33:25,028 --> 00:33:27,068
Is Samantha on her own
at this house?

557
00:33:27,106 --> 00:33:29,332
There are no other patients, right?

558
00:33:29,385 --> 00:33:31,244
She thought that was best,
and I agreed.

559
00:33:31,366 --> 00:33:32,700
Yeah, but let's face it...

560
00:33:32,701 --> 00:33:34,508
You're happy that she's out
of your hair.

561
00:33:34,536 --> 00:33:35,626
I beg your pardon?

562
00:33:35,676 --> 00:33:38,173
Because if you had been
visiting her recently, doctor,

563
00:33:38,239 --> 00:33:40,023
you would know what she's been doing.

564
00:33:40,073 --> 00:33:41,713
Samantha has always been troubled.

565
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,591
3 women are dead because of her.

566
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:44,942
She's not capable of that.

567
00:33:45,005 --> 00:33:46,043
Are you certain?

568
00:33:46,093 --> 00:33:47,804
I mean, the effects of electroshock,

569
00:33:47,842 --> 00:33:49,746
especially at that age, are permanent.

570
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:51,747
But maybe you knew that.

571
00:33:51,855 --> 00:33:54,016
My wife died when Samantha was 10,

572
00:33:54,268 --> 00:33:55,683
and she never recovered.

573
00:33:56,057 --> 00:33:57,325
I tried everything.

574
00:33:57,419 --> 00:33:59,419
Child psychiatry, pet therapy,

575
00:33:59,486 --> 00:34:00,480
nothing helped.

576
00:34:00,546 --> 00:34:02,128
She was cutting herself.

577
00:34:02,193 --> 00:34:03,480
She was in pain.

578
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,815
That's the end of this meeting.

579
00:34:05,844 --> 00:34:07,426
Where's your daughter, doctor?

580
00:34:07,464 --> 00:34:09,698
And, agent Rossi, if you try
to talk to her,

581
00:34:09,877 --> 00:34:12,396
a mentally ill woman, without
her knowing what she's doing...

582
00:34:12,397 --> 00:34:14,306
Do you know about
the women she's keeping?

583
00:34:14,334 --> 00:34:16,744
And have no medical
or legal counsel present,

584
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,857
you'll have no case.
Do you understand me? None.

585
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:22,708
We'll keep the police here in case
Samantha drops in for a visit.

586
00:34:22,771 --> 00:34:23,771
Let's go, Reid.

587
00:34:23,816 --> 00:34:26,327
Hey, a really fast question.
Why are these toys here?

588
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:27,745
I use them in my therapy.

589
00:34:27,812 --> 00:34:30,253
No, I understand that,
but why are they way up on this shelf,

590
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:33,119
away from where any kids
can actually reach them?

591
00:34:33,288 --> 00:34:35,797
They're reminders of
patients that I've helped.

592
00:34:36,111 --> 00:34:37,388
Let me ask you something.

593
00:34:37,491 --> 00:34:40,451
What was the name of the girl
you helped with this one?

594
00:34:42,342 --> 00:34:43,488
Jenny Larson.

595
00:34:43,538 --> 00:34:44,900
And this one?

596
00:34:44,937 --> 00:34:47,266
What was the name of the girl
you helped with this one?

597
00:34:48,248 --> 00:34:49,394
Abigail Moore.

598
00:34:49,693 --> 00:34:51,066
How about this one?

599
00:34:52,195 --> 00:34:53,402
Linda Krauss.

600
00:34:53,461 --> 00:34:56,632
These girls are what, they're like
9- -9 or 12 years old, I'm assuming?

601
00:34:56,633 --> 00:34:58,889
My ph.D. is on the effect of trauma

602
00:34:58,968 --> 00:35:00,260
on prepubescent girls.

603
00:35:00,279 --> 00:35:02,181
I do not appreciate
what you're implying.

604
00:35:02,209 --> 00:35:04,988
Oh, I'm not implying anything.
I'm making an inference.

605
00:35:05,073 --> 00:35:07,474
An inference is an educated guess.

606
00:35:07,581 --> 00:35:09,723
And based on that,
I form a hypothesis.

607
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:11,477
For instance, my hypothesis here

608
00:35:11,517 --> 00:35:13,679
is that after you raped your daughter,

609
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,509
you submitted her to electroshock
treatment to make sure she stayed quiet.

610
00:35:16,546 --> 00:35:17,740
This is outrageous.

611
00:35:17,787 --> 00:35:19,685
And then, out of guilt, you bought her toys,

612
00:35:19,732 --> 00:35:22,521
more specifically,
you bought her a line of dolls.

613
00:35:22,603 --> 00:35:25,289
Because that's what serial
molesters do. They give gifts.

614
00:35:25,326 --> 00:35:26,979
So you continued the pattern

615
00:35:27,026 --> 00:35:28,258
with your other patients,

616
00:35:28,327 --> 00:35:30,825
and once they left your care,
you added their toys

617
00:35:30,909 --> 00:35:32,007
to your collection.

618
00:35:32,054 --> 00:35:35,200
I'm sorry, you can't back
up your story, doctor.

619
00:35:35,273 --> 00:35:37,162
This is why I love my job, doctor.

620
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,236
Because my lab, it's a jury of your peers.

621
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:43,206
My tests will be Jenny Larson,
Abigail Moore,

622
00:35:43,275 --> 00:35:45,501
and Linda Krauss.
The D.A. will put them on the stand,

623
00:35:45,547 --> 00:35:47,610
and I'm going to personally
bring these dolls in,

624
00:35:47,674 --> 00:35:50,151
and we're going to watch how they react.

625
00:35:50,358 --> 00:35:53,067
Or you could tell us where your daughter is

626
00:35:53,105 --> 00:35:55,050
and we'll tell the d.A. You cooperated.

627
00:35:55,232 --> 00:35:57,298
But once we walk out this door,

628
00:35:57,354 --> 00:35:59,520
that deal comes off the table.

629
00:36:11,324 --> 00:36:12,929
2529 Adams Street.

630
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,337
You'll tell them, right?
That I cooperated.

631
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:22,240
You want to knowow I figured you out?

632
00:36:22,861 --> 00:36:23,900
Those toys.

633
00:36:24,069 --> 00:36:25,534
You take care of them.

634
00:36:25,633 --> 00:36:27,102
These ones you treasured.

635
00:36:27,671 --> 00:36:30,423
But you know what?
The collection's not complete.

636
00:36:31,808 --> 00:36:33,085
Where are they?

637
00:36:44,341 --> 00:36:45,684
She's coming back.

638
00:37:11,209 --> 00:37:13,262
I have to put it back in.

639
00:37:13,318 --> 00:37:14,201
No, please.

640
00:37:14,517 --> 00:37:16,179
- Please, don't.
- I'm sorry.

641
00:38:27,314 --> 00:38:28,431
Don't leave me.

642
00:38:33,054 --> 00:38:34,190
Let us go.

643
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,224
I can't.

644
00:38:37,318 --> 00:38:38,248
Samantha?

645
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:39,960
Hi.

646
00:38:40,349 --> 00:38:41,996
Uh, my name's Spencer.

647
00:38:42,033 --> 00:38:43,823
I'm with the FBI.

648
00:38:43,967 --> 00:38:46,101
I know what your father did to you,

649
00:38:46,236 --> 00:38:48,043
and I want you to know

650
00:38:48,109 --> 00:38:50,793
that he can never,
ever hurt you again.

651
00:38:53,256 --> 00:38:55,360
He never touched me.
He's a good father.

652
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:56,431
He loves me.

653
00:38:56,469 --> 00:38:59,981
I know that he probably forced
you to say those things,

654
00:39:00,043 --> 00:39:02,090
and he punished you if you got it wrong,

655
00:39:02,156 --> 00:39:04,552
sent you to the room with the lightning.

656
00:39:05,971 --> 00:39:06,760
Yeah.

657
00:39:07,055 --> 00:39:10,056
The dolls that your father
gave you after he hurt you,

658
00:39:10,091 --> 00:39:11,524
what would happen to them?

659
00:39:11,558 --> 00:39:14,093
He kept them in his office
with the other toys.

660
00:39:14,163 --> 00:39:15,961
That's where he let you play with them?

661
00:39:16,244 --> 00:39:19,124
But when I moved out,
I had to take my friends with me.

662
00:39:19,171 --> 00:39:21,741
I couldn't leave them behind.

663
00:39:21,834 --> 00:39:24,317
Of course.
And so you went you get them.

664
00:39:24,402 --> 00:39:26,604
What... what did you find?

665
00:39:41,384 --> 00:39:42,154
Yeah.

666
00:39:42,533 --> 00:39:44,655
He gave them to another girl, didn't he?

667
00:39:46,681 --> 00:39:48,020
Do you want them back?

668
00:39:48,831 --> 00:39:49,925
He said I couldn't.

669
00:39:49,953 --> 00:39:51,427
He said they were gone for good.

670
00:39:51,615 --> 00:39:53,558
He lied. He's been lying
to you for a long time.

671
00:39:53,659 --> 00:39:55,826
Do you want to see them?

672
00:39:56,471 --> 00:39:57,227
Can I?

673
00:39:57,897 --> 00:40:00,367
Yeah. Yeah,
do you want to play with them?

674
00:40:13,058 --> 00:40:14,842
Clear.
We need medical here.

675
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:22,456
Hold on.
Hold on one second.

676
00:40:22,504 --> 00:40:23,490
Hey, Samantha?

677
00:40:23,936 --> 00:40:26,259
Listen.
You need to go with these men,

678
00:40:26,663 --> 00:40:29,095
but your friends can go with you, ok?

679
00:40:29,638 --> 00:40:32,097
They won't take...
they won't take them away?

680
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,867
I promise no one will
ever take them away again.

681
00:41:08,921 --> 00:41:10,386
Well done, agent Reid.

682
00:41:12,213 --> 00:41:13,048
Thanks.

683
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,740
Checkmate in 12.

684
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:56,675
No way.

685
00:41:57,469 --> 00:41:58,677
Let me show you.
