00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,810
*****

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,400
What time s he taken?

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:06,830
Between midnight and 6 a.m.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,220
Same m.o.as the other two?

5
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,700
All abducted from their beds
in the middle of the night.

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,340
The first two were found strangled
with blunt force head traumas,

7
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:15,730
Dumped in the wharton state forest.

8
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,400
We're just getting word that an amber
alert for the tri-state area has beenssued.

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,780
The cherry hill police department
is about to hold a press conference.

10
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,900
Well,thank you all for
coming this morning.

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,900
It's important we get this information
out to the public as soon as possible.

12
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,820
The parents of the missing
boy are gonna make a statement.

13
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:37,610
I would ask you to please hold your questions
until the end and I'll answer them directly.

14
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:47,920
My name is sarah
murphy,and I'm kyle's mom.

15
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,780
This is kyle's father dan
and,uh,his older brother danny.

16
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,520
My little boy just turned 7 this year.

17
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,330
He's in...

18
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,410
He's in the second grade.

19
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,270
Oh,god. I can't. I'm sorry.

20
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:13,620
Kyle is shy and quiet.

21
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,100
But ever since he joined the soccer
team,he's really come out of his shell.

22
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,160
He's more outgoing.

23
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,610
He even scored his first goal.

24
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,560
Everyone is so proud of him.

25
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,930
Kyle loves to read.

26
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,120
He gets that from his dad.

27
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,410
His favorite books are about dinosaurs.

28
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,310
He knows all of their names.

29
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,640
Glad they took our advice and
started the press conference.

30
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:41,110
Yeah,but it would be nice if
there weren't so many people

31
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,970
- walking all over the crime scene.
- He's allergic to peanuts.

32
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,440
He loves to snack all the time.

33
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:51,160
Whatever happened last
night,whoever took kyle,

34
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:53,690
the murphys want you to know it's ok.

35
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,540
Thank you for finding their little boy.

36
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,070
They know it was a mistake.

37
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:01,150
They just want their son back.

38
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,880
They just want kyle back safe and sound.

39
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,980
What's the theory on what
happened to kyle murphy?

40
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:09,730
We're just hoping that he's lost,that whoever
finds him will bring him back home soon.

41
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,200
This case is similar to 2
other cases in camden county.

42
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,810
Those boys were abducted
and found in the woods.

43
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,550
Yoreally don't think
there's a connection?

44
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,940
We're not ruling that out.

45
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,170
We'll keep the public
informed of any leads.

46
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,050
If you have any further questions,you
can contact me at the station.

47
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,990
I'm detective bill lancaster.
Thank you for coming.

48
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,580
That was fast.

49
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,730
We don't have a lot of
time. Can you show us around?

50
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,540
You should have taken this off property.

51
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:41,520
Yeah,well,the truth is,i wanted
to do this down at the station.

52
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:45,320
Danny and sarah didn't want to leave
the house,in case kyle comes back.

53
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,000
That's kyle.

54
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,380
Uncle bill?

55
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,090
We're friends,and neighbors.

56
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,580
Dan and I grew up around here.

57
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,740
You know,your involvement in this
case could be a conflict of interest.

58
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,370
Yeah,i appreciate your concern,but,uh,I'm not
gonna stand around while kyle's still out there.

59
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,360
I know the other two cases.

60
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,260
I didn't want to admit this to the press,but,uh,no
doubt in my mindthat kyle's the third victim.

61
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:11,040
You know what we're looking at.

62
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:15,490
99% of abducted children are
killed in the first 24 hours.

63
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:19,450
I know. I'm gonna check on them.

64
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,120
We saw the pictures.

65
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,470
We know what this guy
does to little boys.

66
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,940
Kyle murphy might be
the 1% that makes it.

67
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,300
Could take a miracle.

68
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,290
For his sake,let's hope we get one.

Dr. Burton grebin once said,to lose a
child is to lose a piece of yourself."

73
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:17,110
We'll call when we know something.

74
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,260
Dan murphy.

75
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,060
I'm agent emily prentiss.

76
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:33,420
May I ask you some questions?

77
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,990
I think so. Come in.

78
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,310
Thank you all for speaking with me.

79
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,830
I cannot stress enough how much
time is of the essence here.

80
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,520
Abductions from the home are rare,and that allows
us to narrow down the suspect pool even more.

81
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,720
What makes them unusual?

82
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,230
Abductions typically are
about timing and opportunity.

83
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:02,630
Child walks home alone or gets separated
at a shopping center,that sort of situation.

84
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,700
This is a sophisticated
high-risk crime.

85
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,090
Whoever did this has good social skills.

86
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,110
They're highly-functioning,and
they have a steady job.

87
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,090
He wouldn't look out of place to you,

88
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,300
And you wouldn't be alarmed if
your children were talking to him.

89
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:23,630
So he may be wearing a uniform,like
a deliveryman or a mail carrier.

90
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:28,840
Have you noticed anyone hanging around
the neighborhood,talking with children?

91
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,580
Nothing comes to mind.

92
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:33,750
No. Oh--i
don't know.

93
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,080
Mrs. Murphy?

94
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,620
Do you want to take a break?

95
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,970
- I think I need to--
need to lie down. - Yeah.

96
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,890
- Sorry.
- No,it's ok.

97
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,390
Are you able to continue?

98
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,320
Sure.

99
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:07,320
Danny,you and kyle,you always walk to
and from the bus stop together,right?

100
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,650
Yeah.

101
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,510
Have any strangers tried to talk
to you or your brother recently?

102
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:18,870
The bus driver asks
us questions sometimes.

103
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,070
I don't know.

104
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:25,370
What time of day do the
boys usually play outside?

105
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:28,640
Well,they both have
practice after school.

106
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:34,270
But lately,kyle's been into video games,and
danny loves building model airplanes.

107
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,460
Ok. That actually tells us a lot.

108
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:41,190
Uh,i am going to need you
to make a list of everyone

109
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,730
who's been in or around your
home in the past 6 months.

110
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,980
Whoever took kyle has probably
been in this house before.

111
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,790
He watched the family routine.

112
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,860
He knew exactly where everyone slept.

113
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:56,190
And he got kyle out without
anyone seeing or hearing anything.

114
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,250
Daddy...

115
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,130
Yeah?

116
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,290
Can I go play now?

117
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,870
You can go to the family room.

118
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,240
I'll be the soon.

119
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,570
He doesn't really
understand what's going on.

120
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,600
That's probably for the best.

121
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:23,110
Mr. Murphy,we are going to do
everything we can to find kyle.

122
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,210
Thank you.

123
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,740
After the first two abductions,cherry hill compiled
a list of registered sex offenders in camden county.

124
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:38,260
There are 439 within a 30-mile
radius of where the boys were taken.

125
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,860
They have been knocking on
doors,conducting interviews.

126
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,590
They haven't been able
to come up with anything.

127
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,030
They should have called us in earlier.

128
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,900
There are a lot of these men
we can eliminate right away.

129
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:46,730
Right.

130
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,210
No one new to the area. This unsub knows
these neighborhoods. That takes time.

131
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,460
Victims are 3 boys,so cross
off anyone who targets females.

132
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:57,630
We can eliminate anyone whose
preferential age is over 7 or under 11.

133
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:01,310
These boys look nothing alike,so discount
suspects who have a very specific type.

134
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:04,430
If the victims have only brown or
blond hair,they're off the list.

135
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,090
Our unsub's taste of more broad.

136
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:10,520
It loo like his preference is based more
on age instead of physical characteristics.

137
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,570
Let's make a special pile
for more organized offenders,

138
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,960
Anyone who's been arrested for
stalking,uh,breaking and entering,burglary.

139
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,030
How are we doing so far?

140
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,940
With these parameters,i can
probably cross off half the names.

141
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,630
Good. Let's keep going.

142
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,370
I cleared our techs out of here.

143
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,540
What is it you're looking for?

144
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,580
Certain behavior.

145
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,550
What happened here will give
us a clue about the unsub.

146
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:39,850
Kyle's sheet and blanket were
pulled apart and off the bed.

147
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:46,790
Toys were stepped on and
broken,kicked out of the way.

148
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,220
There was a struggle.

149
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:54,240
That's consistent with
the first two abductions.

150
00:08:54,270 --> 00:09:00,960
The boys woke up and fought,but this
looks a bit more chaotic than the others.

151
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:05,220
When we're finished,have the techs
look for any trace of blood or fibers.

152
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,750
He may have gagged kyle.

153
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,210
In the other two cases the
boys were struck on the head.

154
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:12,140
What if he--what if he used
the weapon to scare them?

155
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,260
He could have.

156
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:17,400
He would have had to act quickly
in order to keep kyle quiet.

157
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,730
Tell me things,sunshine.

158
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,300
Uh,garcia,i need your
brain and computer system.

159
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,960
They are one and the same.

160
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,000
Give me your question.

161
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,430
- I emailed you 10 names.
- Yes,you did.

162
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,170
Check their movements
and spending habits.

163
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,870
Start with the cell phone
records,then go to the bank accounts.

164
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:33,990
We're interested in the
days the boys went missing.

165
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,140
Did they talk more or less those
days? Did they spend any money?

166
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,950
Ok,dregs of society
dirt,show yourselves.

167
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,980
- Interesting.
- What is?

168
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:49,330
Well,one of the dregs has not a lick of
cell phone activity,credit card purchases,

169
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:55,390
Or cash withdrawals for 2 consecutive
days in both nomber and february.

170
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:59,490
The 15th and 16th of november
and the 21st and 22nd of february?

171
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,080
Yeah,those are the days.
What does that mean?

172
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:04,090
They coincide with the days the
first two boys were abducted.

173
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,790
He was too busy with them to
make any calls or spend any money.

174
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,880
Our tech guys found this
dishrag and a glass of water.

175
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,180
Kyle's fingerprints were all over it.

176
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:18,370
So,he wakes up thirsty,comes to
the kitchen and gets some water.

177
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:22,720
When we got here,deadbolt on
the french doors was unlocked.

178
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,640
That must have been his exit.

179
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:27,470
Rossi! I got something!

180
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,950
This window is definitely
broken from the outside.

181
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,290
Given the size of it,the unsub would
have to be real slight to get through it.

182
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,530
What did you find upstairs?

183
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,930
There were signs of a struggle.

184
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:42,500
It looks like kyle was
abducted from his room.

185
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,290
The unsub went out through
the family room door.

186
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,310
So,he finds a safe,quiet
place to break in.

187
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:53,980
Everything about how kyle murphy was taken
is consistent with the previous abductions.

188
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,300
Yeah,hotch. Ok. We're on our way.

189
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:03,110
They got a short list.

190
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,460
We've narrowed the list to 5 men.

191
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,310
Already?

192
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:14,670
Registered sex offender hugh rollins,43,lived
in camden county his whole life,

193
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:18,500
In an out of foster care since he was a
toddler,and acquired quite the nice rap sheet.

194
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:20,180
What's his connection to the victims?

195
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:22,600
2 years ago he got a
steady job installing tvs.

196
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,490
Have any of the families
purchased a new tv?

197
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:27,300
The first two did. Garcia
found something else.

198
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:31,420
Rollins had no cell or bank activity
on the days the boys were abducted.

199
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,840
Weaven't been able to
connect rollins to kyle yet.

200
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,400
So,what,we're gonna
wait for more evidence?

201
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,720
No,there isn't time. We have
sufficient probable cause.

202
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,010
Let's go pick him up.

203
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,950
Get bolt cutters.

204
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,500
Hugh rollins,fbi!

205
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:14,970
Clear!

206
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:17,230
- All clear.
- Clear.

207
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,050
Rossi,we're in.

208
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,060
The truck is clean.

209
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,470
I have child pornography
on the computer.

210
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,100
Probably helps him
sleep better at night.

211
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,890
Anything that connects
him to the 3 boys?

212
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,660
- Nothing yet.
- Wait a minute.

213
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,980
- Prentiss.
- Why? What is it?

214
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,220
Souvenirs.

215
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,800
There's no sign of him.
I'm gonna check out back.

216
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,580
Stop! I said stop!

217
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,170
I said stop!

218
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,770
- What are you doing?
- He's getting away!

219
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,570
He's knows where the kid is. Stand down!

220
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,800
Son of a bitch!

221
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:06,100
- No!
- Come down!

222
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,790
I'm fbi! Now stop resisting!

223
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,470
Ok! Don't hurt me,please.

224
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,100
what the hell was that about?

225
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,820
I thought he might get
away. I wasn't thinking.

226
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:29,000
- You're damn right you weren't.
- I know. It was stupid.

227
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:31,850
What if you'd killed him? He's the
only one who knows where kyle is.

228
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,560
I said I know.

229
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,750
Lancaster,I've been where
you are. I was a cop,too.

230
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,230
That's why I knew this wasn't a
good idea. You were way too close.

231
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,710
'Cause I'm not gonna sit still and
I'm not gonna stop until we find kyle.

232
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,950
- Kyle's not here.
- No.

233
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,880
And if he isn't on this property...
He's already in the woods.

234
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:54,690
So,rollins goes to the trouble of
breaking into the murphys' house.

235
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,630
It's a big risk to take kyle.

236
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,210
Then he only keeps him for a few hours.

237
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,690
This just doesn't make sense.

238
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,420
Maybe he saw the news,panicked.

239
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,970
We need to search the woods.

240
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,840
- Thank you for coming in.
- You got someone already?

241
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,560
Sometimes we get lucky.

242
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:19,110
He's our prime suspect,but we
didn't find kyle at his house,

243
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:21,530
But we've got a team searching now.

244
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,470
- The evidence is bagged.
- You ready?

245
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,850
I just need to look at the toys?

246
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:35,230
And tell us if any belong to kyle.

247
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,760
These are jimmy seager's parents.

248
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,380
I'm very sorry r your loss.

249
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,450
- Thank you for coming in.
- Thank you.

250
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,480
Have they found your son yet?

251
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,530
No.

252
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:48,040
I haven't been able to contact
andy loeser's family yet.

253
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:52,070
It's ok. We can get started.
Would you follow us,please?

254
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,340
I'll be right in.

255
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:03,180
Does he look familiar?

256
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,460
He's not what I pictured.

257
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:13,940
I've tried to... Imagine
the last thing jimmy saw.

258
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,880
Now I know.

259
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,460
Do you have kids?

260
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,880
- Yeah.
- Then you know.

261
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,500
You make a promise to protect
them.When jimmy needed us--

262
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:36,560
we were asleep down
the hall,13 feet away.

263
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:43,930
I need you to tell me if any of
this belonged to jimmy or kyle.

264
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,400
Could you do that?

265
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,170
Are any of these kyle's?

266
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:13,930
- I don't know. I'm not sure.
- It's ok.

267
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:27,670
That means that the parents have identified
the toys that we found in your closet.

268
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:31,070
They belong to their boys.

269
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,850
It's over for you.

270
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,990
Where's kyle murphy?

271
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,620
I don't know.

272
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,960
Well,that's not gonna help you.

273
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:49,530
Andy loeser. He was 11.

274
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,550
Jimmy seager. He was 9.

275
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:57,510
But kyle,he's--
he's only 7.

276
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,990
You keep going younger.

277
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:08,190
Guys like you don't last
very long in trenton state.

278
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:12,940
Did you know that the inmates
there watch the news every night?

279
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:18,240
I bet they're looking forward
to getting you all alone.

280
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:22,230
Life in trenton might as
well be a death sentence.

281
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:27,220
Are you sure you don't want
to tell me where kyle is?

282
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,830
If I tell you about this
kid,I'm not going to trenton?

283
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:44,550
I want that written down.

284
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,740
He's gonna confess to killing kyle?

285
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,280
He's desperate. Knows he
won't survive state prison.

286
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:53,910
The d.a.'s not gonna offer a deal until he
has more evidence linking rollins to kyle.

287
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,080
What about the toys?

288
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:57,600
The seagers i.d.ed one,but dan couldn't.

289
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,790
He never delivered a television
to the murphys' house.

290
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,480
So he saw him some other way.

291
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,530
Look,we have this guy.
He's about to confess.

292
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,550
He's done everything
the same. Let's nail him.

293
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,390
He won't confess without the deal.

294
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,320
We need more evidence.

295
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:11,310
Well,then we gotta find kyle. That'll
prove it,right? What about the woods?

296
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,130
Well,it's 100,000 acres to cover.

297
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:18,570
He's out there somewhere.
I'm not sticking around here.

298
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,140
He's too close to this.

299
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,360
We've warned him.

300
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:27,990
I sure would like to have some physical
evidence that rollins was in that house.

301
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:30,190
Take reid over there.
He's got fresh eyes.

302
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,900
Rollins is scared. He's ready to talk.

303
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,870
I'll see what I can do.

304
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:41,210
I'm gonna take them down that
way. Why don't you sweep them in.

305
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:45,400
We've swept the entire area where
the first two victims were left.

306
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:47,900
- What if he went further south?
- Why?

307
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:49,800
There's a service road down that way.

308
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:50,770
That's not on this map.

309
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:54,610
Yeah,it's not marked,but,uh,it would have
been his fastest way in and out of here.

310
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,600
Well,we know rollins didn't
spend a lot of time with kyle.

311
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,970
Let's go.

312
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,250
Here's your deal. Club fed.

313
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:13,250
- Where is that?
- Any federal prison of your choice in new jersey.

314
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:16,150
Where's kyle murphy?

315
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,980
I threw him in the river.

316
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,240
You didn't take him back to the woods?

317
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:27,360
No. I didn't have time.

318
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,710
You threw him in the delaware river?

319
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,760
Yes.

320
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,530
He could be anywhere.

321
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:38,230
Well,i suppose that's so.

322
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,580
We may never find him.

323
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,430
Guess that's true.

324
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:45,350
You didn't throw him in the river.
You need more control than that.

325
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,590
You need to know exactly where the body is so
you can go back and live it over and over again.

326
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,810
Tell me the truth.

327
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:08,570
If he came in through the basement,this
would have been his second flight of stairs.

328
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:11,900
So kyle's is the first room he comes to.

329
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:18,050
This wasn't a quiet struggle. He
probably knocked kyle unconscious.

330
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,810
Then carried him back downstairs.

331
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,120
What's through there?

332
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,090
Danny's room.

333
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:25,760
It's interesting.

334
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:29,220
Another few feet and he
would have found danny.

335
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,980
Danny's far more age appropriate
for rollins' preference.

336
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:34,760
He's closer to the first
two victims than kyle is.

337
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,750
If he'd been stalking these
families,he would have known that.

338
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,800
It's weird.

339
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,570
What,a neat
9-year-old?

340
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,450
Well,that,and most kids either
pick a top or a bottom bunk.

341
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,670
Both beds are slept in.

342
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:52,060
The top bunk blocks the view of the stars,and
there's nothing decorative down here.

343
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:54,900
It's danny's room. He
probably sleeps up top.

344
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:58,130
Somebody wet the bed.

345
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:02,870
You know,maybe danny started in the bottom
bunk,wet the bed,and then moved up top?

346
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:08,300
This is kyle's.

347
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:21,690
It's size 6. Kyle slept
in here last night.

348
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:26,030
If he didn't sleep in his
room,why was it destroyed?

349
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:29,690
To make it look like
the other crime scenes.

350
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,870
Over here!

351
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,640
Oh,god.

352
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:58,630
That's kyle. That's him.

353
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:05,900
I tta call dan and sarah.

354
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,750
We saw the pictures.

355
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:16,220
He dumped the first
two boys like garbage.

356
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,850
This is different.

357
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:21,590
Do you think rollins started
feeling guilt or remorse?

358
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,050
You know he's not capable.

359
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,980
Whoever did this cared about him.

360
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:29,390
Hugh rollins definitely
killed the first two victims.

361
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,680
But it doesn't look like
he killed kyle murphy.

362
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:39,520
I just talked to rollins. He said
he dumped kyle's body in the river.

363
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:41,940
He's clearly lying. He doesn't
have any connection to that boy.

364
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:45,280
The disposal of kyle's body is
very different from the other two.

365
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:50,810
He was gently placed on the ground,neatly
laid to rest with his hands by his sides.

366
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:53,320
Rollins discarded these
two boys like trash.

367
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,450
We think kyle may not have
slept in his room last night.

368
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,490
Where do you think he was?

369
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,960
I think in his brother's
room. Danny has bunk beds.

370
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:04,750
Both bunks were slept in,and whoever slept in
the bottom one wet the bed and left kyle's bear.

371
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:07,020
So do we think someone destroyed
kyle's room to make it look like

372
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:09,670
he was abducted like
the other two victims?

373
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,880
Who else knows the
details of all 3 cases?

374
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:19,090
Lancaster.

375
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,000
Morgan,call garcia and see what she can find
out about lancaster that we don't already know.

376
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,160
Reid and prentiss,watch the
video of the press conference.

377
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:27,830
- See if you can find anything.
- Want me to talk to rollins again?

378
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,100
Yes. And I don't have to remind anybody
where we are. Please be discreet.

379
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:42,680
We found kyle murphy's
body in the woods.

380
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,140
Why did you lie?

381
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,770
You aren't the type to take
credit for something you didn't do.

382
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:50,390
I can't go to trenton.

383
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:53,940
As long as you're straight with
me,I'll tell the d.a. You cooperated.

384
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,780
Is that what you needed to hear?

385
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:01,330
People don't understand. I can't
explain why I do these things.

386
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,550
All I know is that I can't help myself.

387
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:04,880
I don't want to die in prison!

388
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,980
You're gonna be in one for
the rest of your life,hugh.

389
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:10,010
No,I'm talking about what
they do to people like me.

390
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:14,180
- I don't want to go like that.
- Then tell me the truth.

391
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,510
He's too young. He's not my type.

392
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,700
Yeah,garcia,what do you got?

393
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,570
- Who's there?
- Just me and rossi.

394
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:43,850
Ok,i found something
notable on lancaster.

395
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:48,370
Hold that thought.

396
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:50,700
Well,i just talked to dan and sarah.

397
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,210
I told them about kyle.

398
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,660
How'd they take the news?

399
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:55,750
Well,about how you'd expect.

400
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,900
Really?

401
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:02,280
Listen,,i want to thank you for all you've
done for me and the murphys on this case.

402
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:04,710
But... I think we can
handle everything from here.

403
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:08,740
Well,we're not going anywhere,bill.

404
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:14,070
Did you know that kyle liked to sleep in danny's
room or that kyle had been wetting the bed?

405
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:15,670
No.

406
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,090
Because if you had,you would
have torn apart danny's room

407
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,920
to make it look like kyle
had been taken from there.

408
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:21,790
What are you talking about?

409
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,730
Kyle's disappearance was made
to look like the two other boys.

410
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:28,100
Whoever did this had knowledge
of the other two murders.

411
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,290
Listen to me.

412
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:34,170
Rollins murdered these two kids.
He should go away for all of them.

413
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:38,930
Losing a child is a horrible thing.

414
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,560
But if there was a murder,and someone is
concealing a crime,they are going to jail.

415
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:47,140
Rossi,you got a killer in custody.
You got this guy. Let's end it now.

416
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,370
Can we take this in your office?

417
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:54,500
Yeah.

418
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:05,860
What really happened?

419
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,710
I know dan has beena friend
of yours for a long time.

420
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:11,660
But you have an obligation
to protect and serve.

421
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,540
You gonna tell me what
my obligations are.

422
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,550
I've been a cop for 23 years.

423
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,320
Rollins didn't kill kyle.

424
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:20,040
- You don't know that.
- Yes,we do.

425
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,060
I appreciate you coming by.

426
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:31,070
But bill was already here.
He told us about kyle.

427
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,800
That's not why I'm here,mr. Murphy.

428
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,860
We need to talk.

429
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,870
Well,can it wait?

430
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:41,030
You know,danny's not
taking the news too well.

431
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:44,670
No. I'm sorry. We
need to talk right now.

432
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:51,090
Hugh rollins didn't kill your son.

433
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:54,140
Why would you try and
pin this on rollins?

434
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,600
I never even heard of rollins until
you thought of him as a suspect.

435
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:00,580
Look,that son of a bitch rapes
and kills innocent children.

436
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,350
He would have hurt somebody
else's kid until you caught him.

437
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:05,960
What does that have to do with kyle?

438
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:08,840
I am asking you...

439
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:11,410
Look the other way. Please.

440
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,320
No.

441
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,470
Detective,that would be
framing somebody for murder.

442
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,430
Rollins didn't kill
kyle,but you know who did.

443
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,560
They are my friends.

444
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,250
Well...

445
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:31,460
I think you left their
son's body in the woods.

446
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,150
Now,what kind of friend does that?

447
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:40,300
If rollins didn't kill kyle,who did?

448
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,580
You tell me.

449
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:49,410
Someone broke into my
house and took my boy.

450
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:52,250
When I woke up,he was gone.

451
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,090
Who did this,dan?

452
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,220
I don't know!

453
00:27:56,470 --> 00:28:00,580
My little boy is dead,and
you have a suspect in custody.

454
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:04,700
Isn't that good enough?

455
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:12,370
You've been holding hands
since I first saw you.

456
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:15,420
Well... What's wrong with that?

457
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:21,680
When couples lose a child,the
grief is overwhelming.

458
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:25,690
They often blame each
other,and they drift apart.

459
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,180
That's what happened
to the seagers,but...

460
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,540
You two are different.

461
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:35,350
It's--it's like you're
protecting each other.

462
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:40,120
So... I'm going to ask you again...

463
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:44,650
What happened last night?

464
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:50,190
Did you or sarah,did
you get upset with kyle?

465
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,080
- No!
- Was there an accident?

466
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:53,550
No!

467
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,120
Then what are you hiding?

468
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,990
My name is sarah
murphy,and I'm kyle's mom.

469
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:16,190
My name is sarah
murphy,and I'm kyle's mom.

470
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:17,800
And I'm kyle's mom.

471
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,380
- And I'm kyle's mom.
- Please stop.

472
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:23,930
You are kyle's mom,sarah.

473
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,780
Just tell me what happened to him.

474
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,250
Did one of you kill kyle?

475
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,150
Were you ever gonna tell
us about your family?

476
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,830
Why would i?

477
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,000
They've got nothing to do with this.

478
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:56,100
{\a6}<i>***</i>

479
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,350
Your children were killed in
a car accident 3 years ago.

480
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:01,770
Your wife divorced you right after.
Your loss has everything to do with this.

481
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,180
You've got nothing left.

482
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,600
You can afford to break the rules,take
a risk,frame rollins for kyle's murder.

483
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:10,900
Rollins didn't kill kyle
and you know who did.

484
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:13,410
Oh,i did it. I killed kyle.

485
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,010
What?

486
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:23,100
put it in writing.

487
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,410
Detective lancaster just confessed.

488
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:43,740
I need to see him.

489
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,580
First we need yo to
confirm the timeline again.

490
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:47,860
We'll compare it to
lancaster's statement.

491
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:49,180
From both of you.

492
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,570
What about danny?

493
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,810
He doesn't need to hear any more
of this. Prentiss,do you mind?

494
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,970
I've got him.

495
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,470
We can talk in here.

496
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,390
Have a seat.

497
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:12,360
Hey,danny,look,they're just
right here. You see them?

498
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,200
Ok.

499
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:19,280
- Can I have a snack.
- Yeah,sure.

500
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:30,730
You didn't seem surprised when I
told you that bill had confessed.

501
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,010
How am I supposed to act?

502
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:35,370
You know,we should really
be in there with danny.

503
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:37,010
Danny's fine.

504
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,930
First you said it's
rollins,now it's bill.

505
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:43,080
The only thing I know
is that kyle is gone.

506
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,780
You know a lot more than that.

507
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,620
What are you talking about?

508
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:58,410
Your friend just confessed
to something he didn't do.

509
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:03,690
That's enough.

510
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:05,680
What...

511
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:08,740
We can't do this anymore.

512
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:16,000
You,uh,got any games here?

513
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:17,870
I don't think so.

514
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,780
Can I watch cartoons?

515
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:23,110
Sure,yeah. Let's see
if we can find some.

516
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,870
Kyle is shy and quiet.

517
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:31,850
But ever since he joined the soccer
team,he's really come out of his shell.

518
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:35,330
He's more outgoing. He
even scored his first goal.

519
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:38,200
Stop,stop,stop!

520
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:42,330
I can open it for you. Here.

521
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:48,870
Ok? There,it's open.

522
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:58,470
Do you,um,get mad like that a lot?

523
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:01,480
My mom says I have a bad temper.

524
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:09,420
Did you and kyle play together?

525
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:13,390
Only when I had to. He was
always breaking my stuff.

526
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,690
Yeah,i had a little cousin who did that.

527
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,030
That would make me crazy.

528
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,720
I'm not going to miss that.

529
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,160
He would always sleep in my room.

530
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,520
I heard kyle liked your bunk beds.

531
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,810
They weren't for him.

532
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:33,470
They were for my friends.

533
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,590
He was always wetting
the bed like a baby.

534
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,650
Is that why you didn't
want to play with him?

535
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:42,690
He was a baby,wasn't he?

536
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:45,340
Yeah,but he thought he was
big enough to play with me.

537
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,240
Like today,he broke my model plane.

538
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:51,110
It took me all week to make it.

539
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:54,940
Today.

540
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:56,670
How did that happen?

541
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,970
I woke up really early
and wanted to finish it.

542
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,640
I had it all set up in the basement.

543
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:02,820
What time was that?

544
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:05,580
It's too early. Mom and
dad are still asleep.

545
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,140
Go back to bed,kyle.

546
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:11,040
Can I play with it?

547
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,400
You can look at it.

548
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:23,850
Oh--i told you
not to touch it!

549
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:27,070
- I'm sorry,danny.
- You never listen!

550
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,500
Please don't hurt me!

551
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:34,560
After you did that to
kyle,how did you feel?

552
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:38,690
Like i'd get in trouble.

553
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,310
He kept saying "I'm sorry." I'm sorry.

554
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:53,360
Kyle. Wake up. Danny?
Danny,what happened?

555
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:55,690
He broke my plane.

556
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,630
Sarah!

557
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:04,680
No. No... No! No! No!

558
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:07,680
I was so angry at danny.

559
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,770
But I couldn't lose him,too.

560
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,510
Why would you hurt him?

561
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:18,810
- I'm sorry,mom.
- He loved you so much.

562
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:23,300
No... Where are you going?

563
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:24,940
To get bill.

564
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:26,300
What's he gonna do?

565
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,900
I don't know. 'S not like we
can say this was an accident.

566
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:37,370
Dad... I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

567
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:39,370
What's gonna happen to danny?

568
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,570
I don't know.

569
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:46,590
The state can try him as an adult,try
to make an example out of him.

570
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:50,100
You gotta help us.

571
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:53,640
I got an idea. Take danny upstairs.

572
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,170
What are you gonna do?

573
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:58,450
I need you both to trust me. All right?

574
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:01,180
Take him upstairs now.

575
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:04,350
Ok.

576
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,510
How could he do this to you?

577
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,980
Dan,we don't ha a lot of time.

578
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:29,200
Go upstairs to sarah.

579
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:46,360
Then you took kyle into the woods?

580
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:49,540
They're good people.

581
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,330
They didn't deserve to lose both kids.

582
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:56,190
It was so... Quiet...

583
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:59,200
Leaving him there.

584
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:05,520
And I kept telling myself that
this is what happened to the others.

585
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,890
I had to do it.

586
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,700
Kyle would be the third victim.

587
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:18,150
And we would catch a baguy.

588
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,850
A real bad guy.

589
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:24,000
Oh,god.

590
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:28,040
And they might still be...

591
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,860
They might have a chance
to be a family again.

592
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,390
Kyle murphy's autopsy report.

593
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:44,690
2 postmortem hits to the head.

594
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,420
First one was shallow.
Clearly he hesitated.

595
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:51,650
Lancaster had to hit kyle to make the
wounds consistent with rollins' victims.

596
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:53,970
I'm glad he spared them
that part of his story.

597
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:56,540
Look on the second page.

598
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,030
Prentiss needs to see this.

599
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,600
- Can you stay with him?
- Of course.

600
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:34,980
Danny told me what he did to kyle.

601
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:38,880
Do you know what he did?

602
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,250
Yes,we know.

603
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,360
Everything he did?

604
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:53,080
Danny stuffed plane
parts down kyle's throat.

605
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:55,130
What?

606
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,250
He couldn't do that.

607
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,130
You told danny to watch his temper.

608
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,570
What else did you worry about?

609
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:13,690
Danny said you had a puppy,but he died.

610
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,940
God...

611
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:22,170
Your son is ill,and he needs help.

612
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:27,450
The truth is,the only thing
danny isn't capable of is remorse.

613
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,660
He feels nothing.

614
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:36,290
The son you were trying
to protect is a sociopath.

615
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:02,100
It's time.

616
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:13,720
I spent my life on the streets,and
I couldn't be there for them.

617
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:22,050
Every day,i wonder why it
wasn't me in that car...

618
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:28,220
And why I have to live every
single day without them.

619
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:31,440
You know,when dan called,i thought...

620
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:34,010
Maybe this is it.

621
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,940
Maybe I'm suffering
so he doesn't have to.

622
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:40,110
Your kids died in an accident.
Nobody can make sense of that.

623
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:45,630
This family,your friends,they lost
both kids the minute danny killed kyle.

624
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:59,400
What does it even mean,anyway?

625
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,770
What does what mean?

626
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,490
Protect and serve.

627
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:04,580
We all say it every day.

628
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,610
Protect who? Serve who?

629
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:10,760
That piece of human waste in the
other room murdered at least two kids.

630
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:13,330
You know what he is. You're
the ones who found him.

631
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:19,290
And that decent
family,that decent,loving...

632
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:27,050
How did anything that happened
today serve anyone at all?

633
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:31,810
- Who won in the end?
- That's the thing.

634
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:35,580
We don't get to pick who wins,detective.

635
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:38,860
Even if that means no one does.

636
