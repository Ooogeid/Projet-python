Oh, my god! That's hotch and kate!

3
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,200
Hey, are you ok?

4
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,520
Hotchner, is he ok?

5
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,060
He can't fly for a little bit.

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,470
His ears are-- but
he's gonna be fine.

{\a6}<i>LOWER CANAAN,OHIO</i>

8
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,230
Jeez, bo, you scared me half to death.

9
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,810
Such a cliche.

10
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:42,810
See that, bo? Guess i'm supposed
to make a wish or something, right?

11
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,430
Come on, bo.

12
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,990
How is the buzzing now?

13
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,190
It's ok. I think i could
actually get used to that part.

14
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,790
The problem is dealing with the pain.

15
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,780
You're experiencing hyperacusis.

16
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:57,530
It's caused by sudden loud
noises, like an explosion.

17
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,100
So what do we do about it, doctor?

18
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,780
You have a small tear
in your right eardrum.

19
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,320
We'll treat that with a bonding agent.

20
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,290
It'll most likely heal
itself in a week or two.

21
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,190
Most likely?

22
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,440
The condition can
sometimes become permanent.

23
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,170
But i can go back to work?

24
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:15,550
Putting someone in the field with acute
sensitivity to sound would be a mistake.

25
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,440
Agent hotchner, if you're not careful,
you could lose your hearing entirely.

26
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,380
- i understand.
- good.

27
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:26,090
But you'll... Sign my return to duty?

28
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,340
W-what if i said i'd...

29
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,960
Take it easy and...

30
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,820
Limit my role in the field?

31
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:38,460
Stay out of loud places.

32
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,170
Your phone is ringing.

33
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,540
What's up, j.j.?

34
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,650
This is delilah grennan.

35
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:57,270
She was bludgeoned and raped during the
night at her home in lower canaan, ohio.

36
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,390
Lower where?

37
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,970
Small town 40 miles
outside of cincinnati.

38
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,310
Staging the body face-up with the
arms across the chest like that.

39
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,480
Ritual.

40
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,250
Nice hair, by the way.

41
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,300
- thanks.
- uh, there's more.

42
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,270
Small puncture wounds on her stomach.

43
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,530
Note the lack of blood.

44
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,120
They were inflicted post-mortem.

45
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,950
Were there any other victims?

46
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,060
Kind of.

47
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:23,610
Victimology and signature match a serial
killer from the same town 10 years ago--

48
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,790
6 victims spanning over 10
months.he called himself--

49
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,550
The angel maker. I remember the case.

50
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,590
- they caught that guy.
- and executed him.

51
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,930
That's right. He was put to death by
lethal injection a year ago yesterday.

52
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,720
Yesterday.

53
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,050
So we're looking for a copycat.

54
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,480
Honoring the anniversary
of his hero's death.

55
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:41,010
It says here they found
semen at the crime scene.

56
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,610
Perhaps locals will get a dna match
when they run it through vicap?

57
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,890
Well, that's where it gets weird.

58
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,330
They ran it already and
they got a match, too.

59
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,880
Well, if they already have
a name, why'd they call us?

60
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,260
They've got to be kidding.

61
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:59,970
The match they got back on the dna is to
a cortland bryce ryan, otherwise known as...

62
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,810
The angel maker.

The angel maker's victims were beaten
with the assailant's bare hands.

72
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,910
Delilah grennan was bludgeoned with
a heavy instrument, maybe a hammer.

73
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:57,850
Ok, so this unsub's a weaker guy, but at
least someone who perceives himself that way.

74
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,830
So he brought along the hammer to make
certain his victim wouldn't fight back?

75
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,530
They have parachutes on-board, right?

76
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,920
They should. It's standard
on all federal air transport.

77
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:09,060
Maybe we can give one to the elephant
in the room, get him out of here?

78
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,540
That'd be the elephant
with the dead man's dna.

79
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,260
Well, obviously somebody
planted the semen on the victim.

80
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,610
In the victim.

81
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,870
That's one theory.

82
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:17,750
There's another?

83
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:21,380
Think about who shares the exact
dna makeup of another person.

84
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,500
Reid, you're not seriously floating
around the idea of an evil twin, are you?

85
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:27,370
No, i'm not. I'm floating
the idea of an eviler twin.

86
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:31,250
Traditionally, the concept is
a good twin and an evil twin.

87
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:35,440
But in this case, it's
evil twin, eviler twin.

88
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,410
- hotch?
- yeah.

89
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,010
You have been cleared
to fly, haven't you?

90
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:58,050
Before cortland ryan, this town hadn't
seen a homicide in over 30 years.

91
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,880
He didn't just kill those 6 women.

92
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,610
He killed a way of life.

93
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,840
Now this thing's got people
thinking he's come back.

94
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,210
They don't really think that, do they?

95
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:09,840
I guess when you've been scared by something, i
mean really scared, that fear's in you forever.

96
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,230
Let's stick to the facts. Were
there signs of forced entry?

97
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,940
None that we could find, but whoever killed delilah
grennan opened up every window in this house before he left.

98
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,090
That's a signature from
the previous murders.

99
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,090
A detail we never
released to the public.

100
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,360
And it came out at the trial?

101
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,230
No, sir.

102
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,360
Prosecution had ryan nailed 9
ways to sunday. Didn't need it.

103
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,270
So i'm hard-pressed to know how this
copycat knew about those windows.

104
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:35,730
The man we're looking for is most likely a
fan who exhaustively studied the first killings

105
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,220
And used them to form
his own murder fantasies.

106
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,600
He knows this case as
well as us; better, maybe,

107
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,310
If he had actual contact with
ryan while he was incarcerated.

108
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,940
We sent one of our agents to
hawkesville prison to look into it.

109
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,480
And the semen?

110
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:51,760
Smuggled out of the prison, kept on ice,
brought out on the anniversary of the execution.

111
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:55,290
There's an entire cottage industry based
on serial killer effects and memorabilia.

112
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,470
You can find absolutely anything
if you know the right people.

113
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,910
Question is, is this a one-time
commemoration or is it just the beginning?

114
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,460
What about the puncture wounds?

115
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,950
{\a6}<i>City Morgue LOWER CANAAN,OHIO</i>

116
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:09,720
My best guess is a small
screwdriver, like a phillips head.

117
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,730
Just like the prior murders.

118
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,980
This guy's a stickler for the details.

119
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:18,030
The groupings in the prior victims were
always different in number and arrangement.

120
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,610
3 wounds on this one.

121
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:25,050
5, 24. He was all over the map.

122
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,180
But i also found traces
of paper in the wounds.

123
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,970
Paper? Like tissue?

124
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,420
Like notebook paper.

125
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,600
Well, that's new.

126
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,960
Unique to the copycat.

127
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,490
What is it?

128
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:46,920
I don't know. It just seems familiar.

129
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:53,150
Ryan didn't have any next of
kin, so after the execution,

130
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,220
All of his effects got boxed and stored.

131
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,130
This is all his correspondence?

132
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,290
Copies, at least.

133
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:03,240
Helps the warden keep tabs on certain
prisoners if he can know what's in their mail.

134
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,230
There's a lot of letters.

135
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,420
A lot of fans.

136
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,810
Real lady killer.

137
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:10,810
What about male fans?

138
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,350
Some, yeah. Freaks.

139
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,940
This one kid would come
by. Musician, i think.

140
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,830
Black clothes and eyeliner and all that.

141
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:21,340
He sent ryan his demo tape and some
sheet music he wrote in his own blood.

142
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:25,650
Did you ever catch ryan trying to smuggle
anything out, to this kid or anyone else?

143
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,710
Usual problem we have is stuff
being smuggled in, not out.

144
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:34,100
His dna was found at a fresh
crime scene in lower canaan.

145
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,820
What kind of dna we talking about?

146
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,200
Type of dna that cats in lockup
don't have occasion to use.

147
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,260
All right. Well, listen, thank you for all this, but
i want to look at all your visitor logs, all right?

148
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,960
Excuse me.

149
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,490
Yeah, j.j. ?

150
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,320
Ok, uh...

151
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,740
Yeah, i'm headed right back.

152
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,020
Something wrong?

153
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,850
A local newspaper just got a letter from
someone claiming to be the angel maker.

154
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,110
"i give you a legacy, a breath of
life from the angel maker himself.

155
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,640
Those who prayed to forget me will one
day see my face and shrink in fear."

156
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:14,840
That's the last thing
people need right now.

157
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:17,010
Reid, how's it compare with
the original correspondence?

158
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,980
They share some
compelling characteristics.

159
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:22,580
I'd obviously like to look at it under
magnification with a better light.

160
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,900
Best guess, reid?

161
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,260
Say it's authentic.

162
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:35,800
How can this letter be authentic
if the guy's been dead for a year?

163
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,140
Could be an elaborate forgery.

164
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,800
Or it could be the genuine article,
just written before his death.

165
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,160
Well, mail here isn't that slow.

166
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,820
Or released through an intermediary.

167
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,300
You mean the copycat?

168
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,690
We're going over the prison visitor logs
to check who had multiple visits with ryan,

169
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,430
Try to narrow our suspect pool.

170
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:53,240
Sela? What are you doing here?

171
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,670
Is it true? There's a letter?

172
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:56,960
How did you know?

173
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:59,260
You didn't really think you
could keep that quiet around here.

174
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:02,650
The letter's not from him, not
the way people might be saying.

175
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,630
- what does that mean?
- it...

176
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,850
It means we think he has
someone on the outside, a friend.

177
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,130
What if you're
wrong?What if--

178
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,260
There's no such thing as ghosts, sela.

179
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,710
I'm not talking about a ghost.

180
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,990
I am talking about those
rumors about the execution,

181
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,210
How there were problems,
how it didn't work right.

182
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,770
What are you suggesting?

183
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,540
What if he's still out there?

184
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,740
Don't do that.

185
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,660
You think i'm the only one?

186
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,660
Look outside.

187
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,450
They want proof that he's dead.

188
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,990
I have to advise against this.

189
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,060
All due respect, this isn't your town.

190
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:47,080
I have to convince them that
cortland ryan is dead and buried.

191
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,470
But you're indulging this killer by
perpetuating the ruse he's created.

192
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,350
He's right.

193
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,210
It may embolden him,
prompt more murders.

194
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:57,320
Sela lost her only
daughter to that bastard.

195
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:00,220
We met when i was working
the case, grew close.

196
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:05,130
I thought we'd gotten past all this,
but i guess i was kidding myself.

197
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,890
Hotch?

198
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,120
Hotch?

199
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,070
Hotch, are you all
right? Can i do anything?

200
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,560
Yeah, i'm ok, i'm ok, i'm ok. Ok.

201
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,950
My god.

202
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,490
Cortland ryan is dead.

203
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,930
There's no two ways about it.

204
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,580
We're just trying to
be thorough, dr. Hagen.

205
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,120
We heard that there may have been
irregularities with the execution.

206
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,740
His heart was stopped.

207
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,380
His pupils were nonresponsive.

208
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,110
Trust me.

209
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,770
This is not the first
execution i've pronounced at.

210
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,940
But it was the last.

211
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:39,460
Did something happen that day to prompt your
resignation from the corrections department?

212
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,400
Everyone dies different.

213
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,750
Ryan went hard is all.

214
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,630
What does that mean, doctor?

215
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:54,610
After we cycled the drugs, we
realized he was still alive.

216
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,650
We weren't prepared for that.

217
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,290
How is that possible?

218
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,260
The catheter dislodged.

219
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:07,480
We reinserted it, started
the potassium chloride.

220
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:12,010
He started shaking.

221
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:13,870
Spitting.

222
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:16,160
He was suffocating.

223
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,630
Catheter failed again.

224
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:25,980
Took him almost an hour to die, almost
as if something were keeping him here.

225
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,850
He said this was going
to happen, you know.

226
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,200
That what was gonna happen?

227
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,640
His last words.

228
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:36,180
He said he'd come back.

229
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:45,810
You may think you've seen the last of
me, but death cannot take me from you.

230
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,400
I will be born again.

231
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:52,600
Today you make me a legend.

232
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:55,300
Always had a flair for the dramatic.

233
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:59,800
Set the stage perfectly: a latter-day
lazarus returning to deliver hell on earth.

234
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,200
We need to debunk this, or
the whole town's gonna panic.

235
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,290
Little late for that.

236
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,360
The grave-robbing we can explain.

237
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:06,410
It has to be a fan.

238
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:09,670
You think the same person that did
the copycat murder took ryan's body?

239
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,260
It's possible. He had to have help.

240
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,640
Someone on the inside.

241
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:16,270
I suppose you're gonna tell me there's
a cottage industry for that, too.

242
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,960
Did you know that john
wayne gacy painted clowns?

243
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,980
A murdering pedophile paints clowns,
and people hang them on their walls.

244
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,960
It's creepy on so many
levels.i mean, clowns--

245
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,690
Garcia, i didn't know
you had that hang-up.

246
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,580
Coulrophobia--
abnormal fear of clowns.

247
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,240
Oh, no, there is nothing
abnormal about it.

248
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,980
When i was 12, a hobo clown groped
my breast at a birthday party

249
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:38,390
And made this old-timey
honking noise when he did it.

250
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,060
Apparently making it funny makes it ok.

251
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:44,640
Were you able to find any auctions
on angel maker memorabilia?

252
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,770
Oh, my vision. I found a ton.

253
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,720
Mr. Maker was quite the self-promoter.

254
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:54,300
He autographed everything: photos, panties,
and for the discerning collector, screwdrivers.

255
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,400
You got to be kidding me.

256
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:58,880
Yeah. He also made these little origami
figurines out of cigarette boxes,

257
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,870
Which, i hate to say, are really cute.

258
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,660
Did you pinpoint the
most active collectors?

259
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,410
That would be his overseas fans.

260
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,230
What about local buyers who also
turned up on the prison visitor log?

261
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:07,780
Zilch.

262
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,490
What about sellers? High-volume broker
might know a broader spectrum of fans.

263
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:15,030
There is one guy in particular who seems
to be the local distributor, as it were.

264
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,770
You got a name?

265
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,550
Shebang!

266
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,410
- sid rutledge.
- rutledge?

267
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,120
You know him?

268
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:22,250
He's a guard at hawkesville.

269
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,810
Sid rutledge, fbi. Open up.

270
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:35,860
Just want to talk.

271
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:37,900
I can't see anyone.

272
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:44,040
Oh, guy's got two dead
bolts. He doesn't use either?

273
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:49,700
Sid?

274
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:52,460
Sid, we're coming in.

275
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,370
Wakey, wakey, my man.

276
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,950
Damn.

277
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:22,380
One to the grill, one to
the groin. That's personal.

278
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:27,550
Yeah, well, if rutledge was selling the
unsub memorabilia, he knew his identity.

279
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:30,530
Now the unsub's covering his tracks.

280
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:34,570
Rutledge probably contacted him
after you paid a visit to the prison.

281
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:38,790
He let him in, let his guard down, boom.

282
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:43,390
A little, uh, heavy on the old spice.

283
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,310
Strikes me as an aqua velva guy.

284
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,020
Man, you're good.

285
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,900
Hey, it looks like he took something.

286
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:56,230
Hello.

287
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,970
I think we've got this unsub all wrong.

288
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,050
There have been some strange
happenings in this case,

289
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,820
But i urge you not to abandon
reason in the search of the truth.

290
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:10,770
This is not the work of a ghost, and it's not
the work of a killer come back from the dead.

291
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:15,400
This is the work of somebody who lives right
here in lower canaan, and this person is a woman.

292
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:20,650
Her last victim, sid rutledge--
he was the angel maker's mule.

293
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:25,120
He smuggled items out of hawkesville prison, including
the semen that was planted at the first crime scene.

294
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:29,780
She killed rutledge because he knew she was the
copycat, and also because he was blackmailing her.

295
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:32,090
So i'm thinking you and i need to talk.

296
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:35,460
We now know that rutledge was transferred
to hawkesville from a female prison,

297
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,820
In the wake of allegations that he was using his
position to leverage sexual favors from inmates.

298
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,250
And we think he did the same thing to our unsub;
in exchange for his silence, he wanted sex.

299
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,790
Because she shot him in the junk, right?

300
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:50,070
That, and the fact that he took a pde-5
inhibitor shortly before his murder.

301
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:51,220
A what?

302
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:51,910
Viagra.

303
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:55,780
We're looking for a white woman in her
mid-30s and she's highly intelligent.

304
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:58,260
And she's not just a
fan, she's a groupie.

305
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,100
Now, she's not what you
would normally expect.

306
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,750
More often than not, they're
attractive, they're well-educated,

307
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,320
They're successful;
some are even married.

308
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,980
Generally, they fall into
types. Some are reformers.

309
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:10,350
They're on a mission to save
or rescue these murderers.

310
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:13,630
Often, this type of groupie has been raised
in a repressive, religious environment

311
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:19,200
And specifically have been exposed to the ideals
of sexual repression and subjugation of women.

312
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,600
Our unsub is a different type, one
who suffers from hybristophilia.

313
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:25,150
It's a sexual attraction to
men who commit violent crimes.

314
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:30,980
They give her a power that she lacks, which stems
from low self-esteem and a need for a father figure.

315
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,550
Well, the victims were raped.

316
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:33,990
How do you explain that?

317
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:37,610
She's using an instrument to
simulate the sexual assault...

318
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,930
This is something that
she keeps in her rape kit,

319
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,850
Along with the weapon that she's
using to bludgeon her victims.

320
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:49,230
This is a list of women who visited and
wrote the angel maker while he was in prison.

321
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:53,700
We've started to track these leads, but the
list is extensive, so we're gonna need your help.

322
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,030
Hey, you ever get groupies
at your book signing?

323
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:01,240
Sometimes, if barry
manilow isn't in town.

324
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,600
Any of them look like that?

325
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,840
Shara carlino.

326
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:06,270
She visited ryan over 70 times.

327
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:11,160
Waits an average of 3 hours for a
10-minute visit, mandatory strip search.

328
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,800
Would you endure that for a guy?

329
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,710
For barry manilow, maybe.

330
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,530
She was a marketing vp in
cincy till '99, moved here,

331
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:22,610
Took an outside sales job,
commission only-- serious pay cut.

332
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:25,200
I'm guessing she came for the view.

333
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,700
According to these logs, you were
the angel maker's number-one fan.

334
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,660
His name is cortland,
and i wasn't a fan.

335
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,600
How would you characterize
your relationship?

336
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,540
We were lovers.

337
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:43,760
Last time i checked, they didn't
allow conjugal visits on death row.

338
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:46,750
It wasn't about physical interaction.

339
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:50,810
When you take away the
flesh, there's only the soul.

340
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,760
Everything was understood.

341
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,360
There were no secrets.

342
00:20:55,370 --> 00:21:00,730
Cortland made me feel alive,
in a way no free man ever could.

343
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,850
Where were you on the
16th of this month?

344
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:04,490
Why?

345
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:10,740
We believe this copycat killing was committed by
a female fan, someone who knew cortland very well.

346
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,020
I was out of town with the company.

347
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,670
Ask anyone here.

348
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:19,040
- do you know another woman--
- there were no others.

349
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:24,480
I--i can show you logs, photocopies of fan
letters, women who sent cortland pictures,

350
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:27,700
- their underwear-- - they
didn't mean anything to him.

351
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:34,460
But whatever connection you had with
cortland was severed when he died.

352
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:36,720
Not the copycat's.

353
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:40,590
Every time she kills,
it reinforces their love.

354
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:44,700
That is, of course, unless
you help us stop her.

355
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:55,240
He sent me a letter a few
months before he--he was...

356
00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:01,460
I knew it wasn't meant for me,
because it was addressed to...

357
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:03,340
"my dove."

358
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,180
He never called me that.

359
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,020
- do you still have it?
- no.

360
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:08,750
I burned it.

361
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,900
Did the text reveal
anything about the woman?

362
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,270
The text was a joke.

363
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:16,940
Usually his prose was
seamless and beautiful, but...

364
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,910
This was...

365
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,720
Pedestrian and crude.

366
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,130
You never asked him who this dove was?

367
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:27,090
I thought there were
no secrets between you.

368
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,970
You've never been in love, have you?

369
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,740
Victim's maxine chandler.

370
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:19,990
Neighbors say she's lived here her
whole life, all 28 years of it, anyway.

371
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,270
How many kids does she have?

372
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,180
Well, none of her own.

373
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:25,470
Runs a day care.

374
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:30,340
The guy that called 911 came here to drop
off his toddler, found maxine in her bedroom.

375
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,350
Coroner's in there with her now.

376
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:33,470
You check all entry points?

377
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:35,950
Yeah. No damage, no tool
marks. Same as the first.

378
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,220
Now that we have two victims,
we have data we can compare.

379
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:40,050
We should see what
victimology can tell us.

380
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,500
I'll get j. To bring us the
files on the first victim.

381
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,130
What'd you find?

382
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,180
Well, i put the time
of death around 2 a.m.

383
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:49,650
Victim was struck multiple
times with a blunt object.

384
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,990
Signs of penetration, fluids.

385
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,450
Same post-mortem mutilation?

386
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:57,180
Same, but, uh, different.

387
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:59,760
9 puncture marks this time.

388
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:03,850
I wish i could say this was about the unsub's
disorganized behavior or mounting rage.

389
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,250
It doesn't feel that way.

390
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,090
No, they definitely mean something.

391
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,480
- can i have your pen?
- yeah. What is it?

392
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,720
I'm not sure.

393
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,870
- she did this.
- what do you mean?

394
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,900
The unsub.

395
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:25,890
She made these dots like this
before she made the puncture wounds.

396
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,960
That's why the coroner
found paper in the wounds.

397
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:29,280
It was a template.

398
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:32,840
The angel maker did it from memory,
but she needed a guide to get it right.

399
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:35,760
We need to go back and re-examine
each of the patterns. Where's reid?

400
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:39,690
Here's another one to
dove-- november 2, 2006.

401
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,040
- same thing?
- yeah.

402
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:44,050
"weather is good here.
Out in the garden all day.

403
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,710
Birds land on the fence.

404
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:47,710
The moon is full now."

405
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,810
He got an hour a day in a concrete yard.

406
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:53,730
There was no garden.
There were no birds.

407
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:55,490
Death row haiku.

408
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,000
I mean, you have to
try to write this bad.

409
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:00,350
I think he did.

410
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:05,390
He tried very hard to put each word,
each letter, even, in the right order.

411
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,830
So it's a code.

412
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:09,690
This steganographic method would allow him
to write letters that don't appear enciphered.

413
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,930
The real message would
be hiding in plain sight.

414
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:13,070
What do you need to crack it?

415
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,520
The ability to clone myself
and a year's supply of adderall.

416
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:19,270
I'll put on the coffee.

417
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:22,860
Small towns suck for victimology.

418
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:24,780
Too much overlap.

419
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,310
I've got both women at the same
church, same doctor, same grocery store.

420
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:30,190
She's mimicking the angel maker.

421
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:31,780
Maybe we should look at his victims.

422
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,120
Yeah, but there's a disconnect.

423
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:36,240
The angel maker chose women
because they excited him sexually.

424
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,640
The copycat's satisfaction isn't sexual.

425
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,530
Now it's in perfectly
re-creating the murders.

426
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:43,550
So what she looks for in a victim
is someone who's easy to kill.

427
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:46,970
Which, for her, means
easy access to their homes.

428
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,860
What did delilah grennan do for work?

429
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:52,120
She made jewelry, sold
it out of her home.

430
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,370
So they both had home-based businesses.

431
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,990
A stranger could walk in off the
street and be a prospective customer.

432
00:25:57,010 --> 00:26:00,670
Unsub poses as a client,
maybe uses the bathroom,

433
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,790
Cracks the window, so
she can get back in later.

434
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:07,580
Let's check their business records and
see who came by on the day of the murders.

435
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:16,160
No matching names.

436
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:25,160
Sky's so clear here, huh?

437
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:28,160
Never see stars like this in d.c.

438
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,140
It's beautiful.

439
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,270
Oh, my god.

440
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,450
The puncture wounds on the victim's
stomachs represent constellations.

441
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,330
Constellations?

442
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,710
Don't tell me this guy
was following the zodiac.

443
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:47,060
No, these are from a family of
constellations known as the heavenly waters.

444
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,710
Well, i guess we know how
he came up with the nickname.

445
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:54,140
That's why he'd open up all the windows after each
kill, so their souls could be released into the sky.

446
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,980
Delphinus, the dolphin;
equuleus, the little horse.

447
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,990
- anything sound familiar?
- his origami things.

448
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,840
There are 9 constellations
in the heavenly waters.

449
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:04,310
The angel maker killed 6.

450
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,180
Yeah, our unsub continued
where he left off.

451
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:12,040
First she did vela, and then
last night she did carina.

452
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:15,570
The only one left is columba, the dove.

453
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:18,450
One more kill and she completes his set.

454
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,780
She knew the meaning of the stomach
wounds, something even we didn't know.

455
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:24,830
She must have been a lot
closer to ryan than we thought.

456
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,390
They weren't just close.

457
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,530
They were in love.

458
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:32,620
How'd you crack it?

459
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:33,710
I profiled the author.

460
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,780
Cortland ryan was on death row with several
high-ranking members of the aryan brotherhood.

461
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,300
He got the code from the aryans?

462
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,010
Either that or he read a lot
of 16th-century literature.

463
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:46,530
The aryans liked to use a cipher based on a
400-year-old code written by sir francis bacon.

464
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,640
So it's a binary code.

465
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:51,060
Yeah. Bacon used a 21-letter
alphabet. This one's 24.

466
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:53,780
Each letter is assigned a
bit string of 5 binary digits.

467
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:56,010
This combination yields
32 possible encodings.

468
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,340
Normally you'd use a computer
to run all these combinations,

469
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:02,050
But it was quicker just to do it
longhand until i found the right one.

470
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,880
He's so lifelike.

471
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:11,260
Now we don't have a complete record of their
correspondence, but i was able to make a chronology.

472
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,090
The woman he calls "dove" established
contact shortly after the trial.

473
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:18,320
"my dearest cortland, thank
you for writing back to me.

474
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:21,250
The day the verdict was read,
we shared a silent moment..."

475
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:24,930
"i knew then there was a
force willing us together.

476
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:28,960
"every time i see you, i
feel warmed as if by the sun,

477
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:33,230
And yet i fear if i come too close,"
i'll be consumed by your fire."

478
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:36,350
"ever since your visit, i am
crazed with thoughts of you.

479
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:38,310
"already you've entered my dreams.

480
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:43,600
Each time you appear to me, i'm embraced
by a feeling of trust and belief,"

481
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,290
As if i've known you all my life."

482
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:50,620
"as always, i am touched by your
words, "but i long to see you again.

483
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:53,530
Days pass quietly, one into the next...

484
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,270
"my dove..."

485
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:55,450
"i can think of little else..."

486
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,890
My secret wife...

487
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,240
If only they would let us marry...

488
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:59,340
All appeals are lost...

489
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,550
I could finally hold your hand...

490
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,470
The guards celebrated my defeat
by clearing out my cell...

491
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,000
Here is my face...

492
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:07,500
Possessions matter little
to a condemned man...

493
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:12,840
"they die with you,the only
man who will ever truly see me."

494
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:16,760
But i can't leave this world before
seeing your face one last time.

495
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:19,880
"i will bring a part of
you back into the world,

496
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:23,770
And forever you will watch
over us from the stars."

497
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:29,190
What do you think she meant by that last
line: i will bring a part of you back?

498
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:30,560
The murders?

499
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:31,720
She brought him back to life.

500
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:34,460
What if she was talking about his child?

501
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,750
Well, she did say "us"--
watch over us from the stars.

502
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:40,910
She used the semen samples to
plant evidence, not to get pregnant.

503
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:42,660
What if she did both?

504
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:46,280
Well, if she actually had his kid, we might
be able to track her through birth records.

505
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,250
Agent hotchner?

506
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,570
We just got a report of a woman attacked
in her house by a female assailant.

507
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,310
Is she ok?

508
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,760
Sounds like it, but i can't say
the same for the attacker, though.

509
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:59,270
Neighbors heard cries for help,
pretty soon half the block was on her.

510
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:05,670
The victim was coming home from work, said
the suspect approached her in her driveway.

511
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,850
Asked to use the phone
to call a tow truck.

512
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,050
She let her in the house?

513
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,380
That's when the suspect jumped her.

514
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,640
That's not our unsub's m.o.

515
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:15,020
Maybe she was rushing it, trying
to finish off the last victim.

516
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,540
That's shara.

517
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,220
You know her?

518
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:23,310
Shara carlino. Rossi and
i already interviewed her.

519
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,360
She's cortland's number-one fan.

520
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:28,760
Her alibi is solid. She's not our unsub.

521
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:37,220
Shara...

522
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,910
Why?

523
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:40,920
It worked for her.

524
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:43,430
Why not for me?

525
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:46,740
I just want us to be together again.

526
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:58,610
Ok, there were 463 children born in the
lower canaan area between 2006 and 2008,

527
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,860
So if you want me to find baby angel
maker, we're gonna have to narrow this down.

528
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:06,450
All right, well, reid still has more
letters to decode, but he did find a phrase:

529
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:09,830
I knew even before they told me
that the future had taken root.

530
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:10,850
Taken root?

531
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,250
Sounds like someone got good news.

532
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,390
Date of conception.

533
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:14,620
And the date of that letter?

534
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,440
Uh, january 7, 2007.

535
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,390
Ok, so we fast-forward 9 months.

536
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:22,510
- uh, 10 months, actually.
- really?

537
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,560
I know. It was news to me, too.

538
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:26,230
Ok.

539
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:30,580
So we'll search birth records from
august to september 2007. How's that?

540
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:35,190
We'll do single mothers only, in case
she wanted to keep the father a secret,

541
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:38,120
You know, didn't want to brag: "oh,
your baby daddy's a third-grade teacher?

542
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:41,470
Well, mine likes to poke people in
the stomach with tools, so there."

543
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:45,070
There. 9 names. Now that's
a little more manageable.

544
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,850
Hannah dreyfus was in an auto
accident. She could barely walk.

545
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:52,780
Shannon conway moved away when
the plant closed a year ago.

546
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:54,060
Any other names you recognize?

547
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:56,960
- no. - i don't--whoa.
What is it?

548
00:31:56,970 --> 00:32:00,650
Well, this one here sounds familiar,
but i can't really place it.

549
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:02,290
Chloe kelcher.

550
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:04,460
Chloe kelcher. That is familiar.

551
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,280
Chloe kelcher.

552
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,650
She was on the jury.

553
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,960
Well, that makes sense.

554
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:22,610
She would have been exposed to the case evidence,
seen firsthand what he did to his victims.

555
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,760
That's when she fell in love with him,
sitting across the courtroom every day.

556
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:29,510
Well, it's one thing to have a relationship
with a killer, it's another to become one.

557
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:32,460
There might have been an incident
that prompted the transformation.

558
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,800
I think i know what it was.

559
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:39,170
It's a death certificate.

560
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,060
Microvesicular steatosis.

561
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:43,800
Her baby died at the hospital.

562
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,450
- clear!
- clear.

563
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:57,700
She's not here.

564
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:59,340
All right. We all know
what the end game is.

565
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:00,680
She's looking for her final victim.

566
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,870
She may have already chosen one.

567
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,790
Let's tear this place apart, look for
anything that might tell us who she's targeted.

568
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,770
Look at this.

569
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:20,170
She did everything she
could to deny the truth.

570
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,860
What, that he was a killer?

571
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:24,940
That they'd never be together.

572
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,650
Note the view.

573
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,970
Daddy's watching.

574
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:37,730
It must have devastated her to
think that she could hold on to ryan

575
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:40,090
By having his child
and then lose the baby.

576
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:43,240
Completing his murders became the
only way she could hold on to him.

577
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:58,900
Not the only way. Well...

578
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:03,260
Guess that answers that.

579
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:06,290
I assume that's who i think it is.

580
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:08,380
Got an appointment book here.

581
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:12,920
Meetings with delilah grennan and
maxine chandler the day of each murder.

582
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,530
Sheriff, have you found
her tools or the gun?

583
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:15,850
Nothing yet.

584
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:19,680
She has something this morning:
faye landreaux, 162 north--

585
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,180
North red river drive.

586
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:23,010
She's a cpa. She does my taxes.

587
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,220
- she work out of her house?
- yep.

588
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,020
Let's go.

589
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,840
That's it. '85 volkswagen.

590
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:32,090
Chloe's here.

591
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:33,630
Car's still warm.

592
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:36,020
We got to be right behind her.

593
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:39,360
Her windows are closed.
That's a good sign.

594
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:40,870
Well, my team's ready.
Let's get in there.

595
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,020
Sheriff, we didn't recover
a gun at chloe's house.

596
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,400
We have to assume she's armed.

597
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,160
Well, so are we.

598
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:49,940
If you storm in now, she'll shoot, and
chances are she'll start with your accountant.

599
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:51,560
What do you think, guys?

600
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:53,420
I think you should
look for an open window.

601
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,550
Sheriff, i need you to bring all
your vehicles around to the front,

602
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:58,190
Facing forward with lights
off, and i need a megaphone.

603
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:31,720
Hotch, i don't think you
can get through to her.

604
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:33,280
No, but maybe you can.

605
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:34,970
Profile's clear. You
can't talk this woman down.

606
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,440
No, but just to occupy her.

607
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,570
If we're right about the m.o.

608
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:39,230
She's left a window open somewhere.

609
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,220
Morgan will find a way in. We
just need to buy him some time.

610
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,170
Hit the lights.

611
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,340
Chloe, this is the fbi.

612
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,240
We know you're in there, and we
know what you're trying to do.

613
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:05,360
What are you doing? What are you doing?

614
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:09,090
Don't move, bitch, or i swear
to god, i will split you in two.

615
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,310
Please, don't do this.

616
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:13,060
Roll over. Roll over. Roll over!

617
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:16,870
I know you think that finishing what
cortland started will bring you closer to him,

618
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,860
But first you should
know who he really was.

619
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:21,820
Don't worry.

620
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:24,280
There's a much better place for you.

621
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:28,040
I know you thought you were
special, but the truth is,

622
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:30,840
The same things he wrote to you,
he wrote to many other women.

623
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:33,420
I've seen the letters.

624
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:39,020
Dozens read the same lines: without
the flesh, there is only the soul.

625
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:42,330
You don't need to touch me to
feel the love i have for you.

626
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,020
Does that sound familiar?

627
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:53,170
Cortland wasn't who you thought he was.

628
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:55,900
He--he was a
narcissist, chloe.

629
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:58,980
He wasn't capable of
loving anyone but himself.

630
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:05,180
To carla kettinger, he wrote, ever since your
visit, i am crazed with thoughts of you...

631
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:08,130
"already you have entered my dreams."

632
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,800
"each time you appear to me..."

633
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:13,450
"i am embraced by a feeling
of trust "and belief,

634
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:16,540
As if i've known you all my life.

635
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:20,270
It's clear to me now
that you are my fate.

636
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:22,990
" we are destined to be together."

637
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:26,530
"and when i am gone,
that will not change.

638
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:32,580
"i will live on in you. In
death, our union will be eternal."

639
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:36,240
"all appeals are lost.

640
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:38,540
The guards celebrated my
defeat by clearing out..."

641
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:43,500
No, no, no. Don't speak. Don't talk.
I'm gonna get you out of here, ok?

642
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:46,020
"possessions matter
little to a condemned man,

643
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:50,500
"but i cannot leave this world without
seeing your face one last time."

644
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:53,860
Ok, that window over there. I want you
to go to that window. It's gonna be ok.

645
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:54,770
Ok, go, go, go.

646
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:57,750
It isn't your fault that he
made you feel these things.

647
00:37:57,770 --> 00:38:01,110
It isn't your fault your baby died.

648
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,180
No!

649
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:22,060
It's over, chloe.

650
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:24,210
We have faye.

651
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:32,470
You have nowhere to go.

652
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:46,350
I think we got some tear gas.
I'm assuming it's still good.

653
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,310
We're not gonna need it. She
doesn't have any place to go.

654
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,080
Well, maybe she'll do us all
a favor and put herself down.

655
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:54,530
She's not gonna do that,
either. She's not done.

656
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,220
Chloe, drop the gun.

657
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:07,740
Chloe, drop the gun.

658
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:12,690
Damn it, lady, drop it!

659
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:22,070
I'm coming to you, baby.

660
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,820
Hotch.

661
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:01,330
What did she do?

662
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,500
We took her victim.

663
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,400
She had to complete his work.

664
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:09,200
Wendell berry said, "the
past is our definition.

665
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:14,310
"we may strive with good reason to
escape it or to escape what is bad in it,"

666
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:17,940
But we will escape it only by
adding something better to it."

667
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,110
I made these for your flight.

668
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:19,900
Thank you.

669
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:22,790
- it's small thanks,
but-- - my recipe.

670
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,680
I'm sorry you had to go
through all this again.

671
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:28,890
I suppose we never stop
going through it, but...

672
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,530
Maybe now.

673
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,600
Hopefully.

674
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:37,630
She gonna be ok?

675
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:40,560
Yeah, she'll be fine.

676
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:44,340
Maybe you got to sit with the past
before you can walk away from it.

677
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,560
Thank you, sheriff.

678
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:48,440
Thank you.

679
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:50,310
Anyone get directions
back to the airstrip?

680
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,060
Town's only got one road. We'll find it.

681
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:54,690
Yeah, morgan doesn't
like to follow directions.

682
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,690
You didn't know about that?

683
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,420
Yeah, he likes to vibe it.

684
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:59,390
Ok, smart ass. You drive.

685
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,700
Oh, great.

686
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:04,530
- thank you.
- for the flight.

687
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:05,720
What?

688
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:07,680
Just gonna grab my bag.

689
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:10,760
You're not coming?

690
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:13,010
I, uh, think i'm gonna drive.

691
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,010
Oh, it's over 7 hours back to quantico.

692
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:17,590
I really shouldn't be flying.

693
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:21,140
I've done that drive before.

694
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:23,540
You'll see a lot of pretty
country along the byways.

695
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,540
You might consider...

696
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:28,320
Stretching it out a day or two.

697
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,900
Maybe i will. Thanks.
