1
00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:12,428
911. What's your emergency?

2
00:00:20,953 --> 00:00:23,400
Ma'am, you need to calm down.

3
00:00:24,176 --> 00:00:26,256
Yes, sir, we have units on the way.

4
00:00:31,368 --> 00:00:33,282
There's a dead body
in the warehouse.

5
00:00:33,903 --> 00:00:35,177
Excuse me, sir?

6
00:00:35,849 --> 00:00:38,720
<i>There's a dead body </i>in the warehouse
in Crawfordville.

7
00:00:39,233 --> 00:00:41,913
<i>Can you be more specific
about the location of that warehouse?</i>

8
00:00:42,221 --> 00:00:44,293
West of Crawfordville highway,

9
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,780
South of woodland.

10
00:00:46,161 --> 00:00:47,296
A dirt road.

11
00:00:47,827 --> 00:00:49,340
Do you have an address?

12
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,051
No.

13
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:55,680
Charlie 44, role to location

14
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:57,264
of possible dead body.

15
00:00:57,957 --> 00:00:59,445
Is someone on the way?

16
00:00:59,867 --> 00:01:01,977
Yes, but I need you to stay
on the line with me.

17
00:01:02,457 --> 00:01:04,192
<i>Are you sure the victim is dead?</i>

18
00:01:04,485 --> 00:01:05,940
He will be in a second.

19
00:01:06,606 --> 00:01:07,567
Excuse me?

20
00:01:10,782 --> 00:01:11,529
Sir?

21
00:01:12,938 --> 00:01:15,246
<i>Charlie 44, we have shots fired now.</i>

22
00:01:15,371 --> 00:01:18,535
<i>I repeat, shots fired.
I'm not sure what's going on in there,</i>

23
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,830
<i>but I no longer have contact
with the complainant.</i>

24
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:23,141
<i>Advise and use extreme caution.</i>

25
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,466
This is Charlie 44.
We're on scene.

26
00:02:02,982 --> 00:02:04,341
It's quiet out front.

27
00:02:05,267 --> 00:02:06,375
We're moving in.

28
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:09,298
<i>10-4. Use caution.
Ems is on the way, too.</i>

29
00:02:20,524 --> 00:02:21,907
Eyes open, Ray.

30
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,785
State police!

31
00:02:44,504 --> 00:02:46,531
State police! Open the door!

32
00:03:01,811 --> 00:03:03,464
You, in the chair!

33
00:03:04,214 --> 00:03:06,276
Stand up and let me see your hands.

34
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:12,153
Last chance, man!

35
00:03:12,493 --> 00:03:13,466
Stand up!

36
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,872
Lord have mercy.

37
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:32,461
Do not blow dinner, Ray.

38
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,565
I'm OK.

39
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:36,006
I mean it.
You need to outside, you go.

40
00:03:37,115 --> 00:03:38,334
I said I'm fine.

41
00:03:39,073 --> 00:03:42,519
This is Charlie 44. You can cancel
that EMS out here, dispatch.

42
00:03:43,351 --> 00:03:44,640
<i>Are you sure, 44?</i>

43
00:03:45,026 --> 00:03:46,749
Oh, yeah, I'm sure.

44
00:03:47,511 --> 00:03:50,019
This looks to be
a successful suicide.

45
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:51,605
10-4.

46
00:03:54,821 --> 00:03:56,321
What the hell...

47
00:03:58,126 --> 00:03:59,274
Got a light.

48
00:04:09,077 --> 00:04:10,846
Take a look at this, Tommy.

49
00:04:16,324 --> 00:04:17,778
These women all dead?

50
00:04:21,443 --> 00:04:23,552
Doesn't say this one's
every been found.

51
00:04:24,396 --> 00:04:25,837
I recognize that name.

52
00:04:25,962 --> 00:04:28,076
She only went missing 3 weeks ago.

53
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:32,939
This is 44 again.

54
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:35,810
We're gonna need bosses,

55
00:04:35,935 --> 00:04:38,777
, detectives,
crime scene out here on the double.

56
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,209
Hell, just...

57
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,472
Send everybody.

58
00:04:50,648 --> 00:04:52,265
Have a good weekend, JJ.

59
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:53,626
Sorry.

60
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:56,765
There goes my beach house rental.

61
00:04:57,093 --> 00:05:00,117
And my non-refundable sin
to win weekend

62
00:05:00,242 --> 00:05:02,707
- in Atlantic city.
- Sin to win?

63
00:05:05,137 --> 00:05:06,777
And I always win big.

64
00:05:08,476 --> 00:05:09,836
I didn't have any plans.

65
00:05:14,703 --> 00:05:16,109
These were just faxed to me.

66
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:19,109
I talked to a Tallahassee Detective
who's been working a missing coed.

67
00:05:19,555 --> 00:05:23,238
Rebecca Daniels- she went missing while
jogging Near the FSU campus 3 weeks ago.

68
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,383
Who's this?

69
00:05:24,508 --> 00:05:28,202
Florida state police responded to an
apparent suicide an hour and a half ago.

70
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,996
Middle-aged male.
Those are photos of him postmortem.

71
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,374
- What's with the tattoos?
- He's covered in them,

72
00:05:33,672 --> 00:05:36,585
almost completely.
That's why they requested our presence.

73
00:05:37,223 --> 00:05:39,895
The tattoos are portraits
of previously missing women,

74
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,376
with the years of death or the years
the remains were recovered, anyway.

75
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:46,339
The tattoos correlate to faces
on a wall next to the body,

76
00:05:46,464 --> 00:05:49,098
with information on
the women going back 10 years.

77
00:05:49,374 --> 00:05:51,308
Rebecca is also shown on that wall,

78
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,299
but there's no image
of her on the body.

79
00:05:53,424 --> 00:05:56,195
The Detective thinks that that may
mean that she's alive somewhere.

80
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,565
He called in his own suicide,
didn't he?

81
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,193
- Yeah. How did you...
- He staged all this.

82
00:06:01,891 --> 00:06:04,152
No reason to put on a show
without an audience.

83
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:07,783
Tell them to leave the body where it is.
We need to see it how he wanted it seen.

84
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:10,786
If this girl's still out there, the only
one who knows where she is may be dead.

85
00:06:57,482 --> 00:06:58,946
"A sincere artist

86
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,876
"tries to create something
which is in itself

87
00:07:02,134 --> 00:07:03,353
"a living thing."

88
00:07:03,704 --> 00:07:05,427
<i>Painter William Dobell.</i>

89
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,140
This heat is brutal.

90
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,683
It isn't so much the heat
as it is the humidity.

91
00:07:14,808 --> 00:07:17,644
At some point it doesn't matter
how you look at it. It all sucks.

92
00:07:24,248 --> 00:07:25,783
- FBI?
- Yes, sir.

93
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,812
John Barton, Tallahassee pd.
I'm the primary on the missing girl,

94
00:07:28,937 --> 00:07:30,115
Rebecca Daniels.

95
00:07:30,442 --> 00:07:32,364
I got my files in
the car if you need them.

96
00:07:32,489 --> 00:07:34,321
I'm Agent Hotchner.
This is Agent Rossi,

97
00:07:34,446 --> 00:07:36,817
Agent Prentiss, Dr. Reid,
Agent Morgan, Agent Jareau.

98
00:07:36,942 --> 00:07:39,637
- We spoke on the phone.
- Thanks for coming out so quickly.

99
00:07:39,762 --> 00:07:42,801
I appreciate that. I've also confirmed
that all the women Are victims

100
00:07:42,926 --> 00:07:46,423
from around the southeast,
Florida, Louisiana, Georgia, Alabama.

101
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:49,418
Rebecca's the only woman on the wall
Who's not represented on his body?

102
00:07:49,543 --> 00:07:51,106
Yeah, she's the only one.

103
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:54,117
Hope you have a strong stomach.

104
00:08:02,828 --> 00:08:05,558
The chair was turned like that?
This is exactly where you found him?

105
00:08:05,683 --> 00:08:06,519
Yeah.

106
00:08:08,676 --> 00:08:10,155
Talk about staging.

107
00:08:10,492 --> 00:08:12,719
- Talk about ego.
- There's also

108
00:08:12,844 --> 00:08:16,036
a couple boxes with journal, composition
books. They're filled with writing.

109
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,961
We haven't been through them yet
other than to dust them for prints.

110
00:08:19,086 --> 00:08:21,328
- Have you identified him?
- We're working on it.

111
00:08:21,453 --> 00:08:24,574
We got a rush on the DNA and the prints.
He's cleared locally,

112
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:27,214
but it's gonna take some time
to get the national records.

113
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:30,333
- What about property records?
- Talked to the owner.

114
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:33,095
She said she rented it
a couple weeks ago to a quiet,

115
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:34,763
normal-looking guy named Bob.

116
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,724
He said he wanted to store some
equipment, and he paid in cash.

117
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,415
They're always normal.

118
00:08:39,774 --> 00:08:41,778
- No lease?
- Month to month, no.

119
00:08:42,001 --> 00:08:45,083
Out here in the boonies you don't
get a lot of, record-keeping types.

120
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,591
Especially when it comes to
cash transactions, I'll bet.

121
00:08:47,716 --> 00:08:49,153
He's no kid,

122
00:08:49,434 --> 00:08:51,572
yet the missings go
back Only 10 years?

123
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,841
- As far as I could tell.
- Late bloomer.

124
00:08:55,195 --> 00:08:56,410
You see this a lot,

125
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:58,203
these guys killing themselves?

126
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:02,203
Most serial killers who commit suicide
Do it in prison after they're caught.

127
00:09:02,437 --> 00:09:05,906
JJ, gather as much information
about the prior victims as you can.

128
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:07,921
Morgan and Prentiss,
take the journals.

129
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,655
Dave, you and Reid, the tattoos.
See if he left any clues about

130
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,378
where miss Daniels might be.

131
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,519
You think there's a chance
she might still be alive?

132
00:09:15,644 --> 00:09:17,273
It's probably better
not to speculate.

133
00:09:17,398 --> 00:09:20,350
May I take a look at the case
files you have on miss Daniels?

134
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:24,271
He was on the phone
with dispatch and then.

135
00:09:26,819 --> 00:09:28,150
Must be what, 15 feet?

136
00:09:28,952 --> 00:09:30,319
Consummate overachiever.

137
00:09:33,877 --> 00:09:34,721
Right.

138
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,743
Why is it when men kill themselves,

139
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:41,330
It gets everywhere, but women don't
leave a mess, Like they were never there?

140
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:44,626
Women worry about
who has to clean up.

141
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,255
Men don't give a damn.

142
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,134
JJ, what have you found?

143
00:09:48,368 --> 00:09:50,839
The earliest clipping
is from 10 years ago,

144
00:09:51,134 --> 00:09:54,593
and they're in order, oldest to newest.
Brenda Carlyle first,

145
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,137
- Rebecca Daniels last.
- That was thoughtful of him.

146
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,473
One victim a year
for 10 years straight.

147
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:03,018
Each girl's remains were recovered
In a well-traveled wooded area.

148
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,355
Strangled,
repeatedly sexually assaulted,

149
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:09,487
and then about a week later,
another woman goes missing.

150
00:10:09,612 --> 00:10:12,740
Did the new abductions happen before
the previous body's been found?

151
00:10:12,986 --> 00:10:15,864
- No, never.
- So he has a year-long cycle.

152
00:10:16,431 --> 00:10:18,435
He uses them up
and he gets a newer model.

153
00:10:19,331 --> 00:10:21,136
But he won't take another girl

154
00:10:21,261 --> 00:10:22,987
until the last body's been found.

155
00:10:23,284 --> 00:10:26,565
He's telling a story and he can't start
a new one Until the old one's over.

156
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:29,211
Look at that. At the turn of
the 16th century, Rose tattoos

157
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,682
were put on men
who were sentenced to death.

158
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,608
Really?

159
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:35,592
Yeah. If they escaped, it served
to identify them. But now roses

160
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,327
pretty much symbolize pure love.

161
00:10:37,452 --> 00:10:39,741
Pure love.
Right before he kills them.

162
00:10:39,866 --> 00:10:41,897
- Have you read "the illustrated man"?
- Nope.

163
00:10:42,022 --> 00:10:44,682
It's amazing. It's a collection
of short stories By Ray Bradbury,

164
00:10:44,807 --> 00:10:47,354
based on the metafictive device
of a man who's covered in tattoos

165
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:49,398
drawn by a woman from the future.

166
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:52,469
At nighttime, the tattoos come to life
and tell a story. It's pretty awesome.

167
00:10:52,594 --> 00:10:54,344
These do tell a story.

168
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:56,953
You want to see something?

169
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,270
A space in the tree.

170
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:05,095
And there's no date on that one.

171
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,274
Why would he leave
that space blank?

172
00:11:07,316 --> 00:11:09,168
Maybe this guy's just a psycho.

173
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:12,004
If it were that simple,
we'd all be out of a job.

174
00:11:15,032 --> 00:11:16,091
Hey, Reid.

175
00:11:18,434 --> 00:11:19,470
What's up?

176
00:11:20,863 --> 00:11:23,048
Our man here was a
prolific journaler.

177
00:11:23,857 --> 00:11:25,983
With teeny tiny handwriting.

178
00:11:26,025 --> 00:11:29,255
He probably had counseling at some point
when journaling was part of his therapy.

179
00:11:29,297 --> 00:11:31,080
That's what we were thinking.

180
00:11:32,807 --> 00:11:33,856
And?

181
00:11:33,898 --> 00:11:36,015
And, uh, Well, you know,
the two of us,

182
00:11:36,057 --> 00:11:39,128
it would take us like 3 days
to read all of this stuff.

183
00:11:41,795 --> 00:11:42,910
You guys owe me.

184
00:11:53,834 --> 00:11:56,782
It's no wonder no one has
ever connected these cases.

185
00:11:56,973 --> 00:11:59,746
They're from different states,
different jurisdictions.

186
00:11:59,832 --> 00:12:02,628
It's probably no accident.
He knows the system.

187
00:12:03,746 --> 00:12:05,391
Why kill himself now?

188
00:12:05,575 --> 00:12:07,557
He wasn't on anyone's radar.

189
00:12:07,714 --> 00:12:09,385
Something changed.

190
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:11,843
Let's gather everyone.

191
00:12:12,054 --> 00:12:13,627
So what do we know so far?

192
00:12:13,701 --> 00:12:17,300
He wanted the police here.
He wanted us to see all this.

193
00:12:17,342 --> 00:12:18,656
He was definitely a sadist.

194
00:12:18,698 --> 00:12:21,096
From what we saw, his journals
were graphic and meticulous.

195
00:12:21,138 --> 00:12:23,172
Covering himself with
his victims' likeness

196
00:12:23,214 --> 00:12:26,475
is methodical, possessive.
He'll always own them.

197
00:12:26,517 --> 00:12:28,589
And the suicide shows commitment.

198
00:12:28,631 --> 00:12:31,920
He's organized and compulsive.
The crimes are on an annual cycle.

199
00:12:31,962 --> 00:12:33,585
Computer printouts on the board,

200
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,857
they were all printed
on the same day, 2 weeks ago.

201
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:37,468
That's when he
rented this building.

202
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:40,087
And proceeded to move everything
into it. It's a history of his crimes.

203
00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:42,184
So he did all of this in 2 weeks.

204
00:12:42,226 --> 00:12:44,867
He got away with it for 10 years.
He could have kept going.

205
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:48,736
But he decides to end it all
and hand everything to us.

206
00:12:48,778 --> 00:12:50,436
That's it...everything.

207
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,844
- Everything.
- Reid?

208
00:12:51,886 --> 00:12:53,897
Everything. His body,
the tattoos, the clippings,

209
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:56,623
The printout, the journals.
He moved it all into one room.

210
00:12:56,665 --> 00:12:58,694
He wanted us to see all of it.
See all of him--

211
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,630
his work... the women,
he put them in chronological order.

212
00:13:01,672 --> 00:13:03,256
He's screaming, "look at me."

213
00:13:03,298 --> 00:13:05,206
- We all got that.
- No, but think about it.

214
00:13:05,248 --> 00:13:07,571
If you take a step back,
it sort of makes sense.

215
00:13:07,613 --> 00:13:10,580
It's just a confession.
A giant, flashy confession.

216
00:13:10,622 --> 00:13:11,712
What would we say

217
00:13:11,754 --> 00:13:14,461
if an unsub turned himself in to the police
before they were even onto him?

218
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:16,128
That he was trying
to hide something.

219
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,151
Or someone.

220
00:13:17,915 --> 00:13:19,629
He made a mistake-
in his third book.

221
00:13:19,671 --> 00:13:21,468
I almost missed it,
but then I caught it.

222
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:24,335
"I thought it would take longer,
"but today was the lucky day.

223
00:13:24,377 --> 00:13:27,397
"she almost walked right by,
"almost missed her completely,

224
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:28,855
"but at the last moment,

225
00:13:28,897 --> 00:13:30,951
We found our latest guest."

226
00:13:31,046 --> 00:13:32,083
We.

227
00:13:32,628 --> 00:13:33,770
He has a partner.

228
00:13:34,917 --> 00:13:37,766
He put everything in this room
So we wouldn't look further,

229
00:13:37,808 --> 00:13:39,428
wouldn't dig even deeper.

230
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:42,362
If he has a partner, he's still out
there, and he's got Rebecca Daniels.

231
00:14:18,249 --> 00:14:19,921
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

232
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:23,317
I was calling out, but I guess
your music was too loud.

233
00:14:23,359 --> 00:14:25,585
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine. It's all right.

234
00:14:25,627 --> 00:14:26,758
Juliet Monroe?

235
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,492
- That's me.
- That's for you.

236
00:14:29,065 --> 00:14:30,764
If I can get you to sign here.

237
00:14:32,584 --> 00:14:34,779
- Thank you very much. Sorry about that.
- It's fine.

238
00:14:34,821 --> 00:14:36,537
- Have a great day, now.
- You, too.

239
00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:37,635
Ma'am.

240
00:14:54,473 --> 00:14:55,908
My dearest love,

241
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,645
by the time you read this,

242
00:14:57,687 --> 00:14:59,335
I will have gone.

243
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:02,172
Our life together has
brought me more joy

244
00:15:02,214 --> 00:15:05,065
than a man like me thought
he could ever know.

245
00:15:09,517 --> 00:15:11,923
My first wish would be
to take you with me,

246
00:15:12,347 --> 00:15:14,847
but since you are in our
home readying yourself

247
00:15:14,889 --> 00:15:16,959
with the next chapter
of our life...

248
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:20,127
to care for and raise
our beautiful child,

249
00:15:20,885 --> 00:15:23,058
My last hope is that you finish...

250
00:15:23,206 --> 00:15:24,513
what we started.

251
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:40,318
Please...

252
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,356
Please...

253
00:15:43,873 --> 00:15:45,909
Just let me go home.

254
00:15:47,209 --> 00:15:48,990
This is your fault.

255
00:15:50,914 --> 00:15:52,326
This is your fault.

256
00:15:53,812 --> 00:15:54,833
Please...

257
00:16:20,742 --> 00:16:22,338
What's she doing down there?

258
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,137
She's trying to keep the media
from running the story right now.

259
00:16:25,179 --> 00:16:27,021
But wouldn't that help
us get it out there,

260
00:16:27,063 --> 00:16:28,768
put some pressure on the partner?

261
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:30,770
But if the partner didn't
know about the suicide,

262
00:16:30,812 --> 00:16:32,854
He might dispose
of miss Daniels and disappear.

263
00:16:32,896 --> 00:16:35,449
If anyone can stop the media
from running something, it's JJ.

264
00:16:35,491 --> 00:16:37,106
So let's profile the partner.

265
00:16:37,148 --> 00:16:41,078
We know that the unsub was
a dominant personality, an Alpha.

266
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,094
Can any of you guys think of a case

267
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:45,837
where a dominant unsub
committed suicide

268
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:48,314
- to protect a submissive partner?
- No.

269
00:16:48,582 --> 00:16:50,805
So the partner must be
an equal in some way,

270
00:16:50,847 --> 00:16:52,372
or at least not a competitor,

271
00:16:52,414 --> 00:16:54,648
not somebody that he needed
to feel dominance over.

272
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,528
Maybe it was someone
he cared about?

273
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:59,192
It would be hard for a sadistic
psychopath to care about anybody.

274
00:16:59,234 --> 00:17:01,327
Which would make the partner all
that much more important to him.

275
00:17:01,369 --> 00:17:02,743
What about the tattoo artist?

276
00:17:02,785 --> 00:17:04,356
He couldn't have done
those by himself.

277
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,961
- Maybe that's the role for the partner.
- It would certainly make him important.

278
00:17:07,003 --> 00:17:09,084
What the hell does any of
this have to do with Becky?

279
00:17:09,126 --> 00:17:11,363
I mean, isn't there something
we should be doing, damn it?

280
00:17:11,848 --> 00:17:14,169
Detective, may I speak
with you for a moment?

281
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:21,426
So we have until the
evening news--6 P.M.

282
00:17:21,468 --> 00:17:22,873
How much do they know?

283
00:17:22,915 --> 00:17:25,175
Oh, the troopers
told them everything.

284
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,662
Agent Rossi,
please tell me you called

285
00:17:27,704 --> 00:17:30,788
because the case is over
and I can erase this freakity-freak

286
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,938
off my otherwise
uber-delicious desktops.

287
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,402
Long way to go, kid.

288
00:17:34,444 --> 00:17:37,272
I am into epidermartistry
as much as the next gen xer,

289
00:17:37,314 --> 00:17:39,933
but this guy...Eesh, I'm just glad

290
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,465
He's not breathing the same air as you,
my fine furry friends.

291
00:17:42,507 --> 00:17:45,880
Agreed. What have you found out
about tattoo artists down here?

292
00:17:45,922 --> 00:17:49,568
That the state of Florida requires
licensing for all skin illustrators, but

293
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:52,153
and I am not going to
elaborate on how I know this

294
00:17:52,195 --> 00:17:55,657
not everyone in the body art lifestyle
goes through official channels.

295
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,684
All right, we'll start
with the legit ones

296
00:17:57,726 --> 00:18:00,167
and see if anyone
recognizes the work.

297
00:18:00,356 --> 00:18:02,706
- I shall send the list to your PDA.
- Thanks.

298
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:06,450
Epidermartistry?

299
00:18:14,562 --> 00:18:16,343
<i>...What is happening.
She will get...</i>

300
00:18:16,385 --> 00:18:18,638
<i>Only a girl can fill
that empty energy.</i>

301
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,196
<i>Starting to get angry.</i>

302
00:18:20,238 --> 00:18:21,705
<i>I approach her door...</i>

303
00:18:24,797 --> 00:18:27,530
Look, I'm sorry I popped off.
I'm just a little worked up.

304
00:18:27,572 --> 00:18:30,200
I've been over the Rebecca
Daniels case file, your reports.

305
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:32,140
- Do you know her?
- What?

306
00:18:33,452 --> 00:18:35,071
Is there a personal relationship?

307
00:18:35,954 --> 00:18:37,783
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

308
00:18:37,982 --> 00:18:40,166
You've referred to
her twice as Becky.

309
00:18:40,737 --> 00:18:41,752
I did?

310
00:18:41,794 --> 00:18:44,537
And nowhere else is she referred
to that way. It's always Rebecca.

311
00:18:44,579 --> 00:18:46,800
Now, if there's something that's
gonna cloud your judgment,

312
00:18:46,842 --> 00:18:48,319
I need to know about it.

313
00:18:50,059 --> 00:18:51,600
No. I don't know her.

314
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,889
Then what is it?

315
00:18:55,866 --> 00:18:57,093
Look, I've...

316
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,333
I've been doing this
a long time, and...

317
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,897
it usually just washes right over me,
you know, people...

318
00:19:03,629 --> 00:19:06,248
killing people, depravity, you know?

319
00:19:06,974 --> 00:19:09,133
As long as you make it
home at night, right?

320
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:12,137
But this one...

321
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,056
her parents...

322
00:19:16,731 --> 00:19:18,214
they're just such good,

323
00:19:18,898 --> 00:19:21,957
decent people. She seems
like an amazing girl, and...

324
00:19:23,673 --> 00:19:24,953
it's all...

325
00:19:27,899 --> 00:19:29,746
Sometimes it's just too much.

326
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:32,831
You take it personal.

327
00:19:35,235 --> 00:19:36,478
Stupid, right?

328
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:41,206
Caring about a victim,

329
00:19:41,652 --> 00:19:43,123
personalizing them,

330
00:19:43,322 --> 00:19:45,475
can only be stupid
if it's reckless.

331
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,455
Don't worry about me.

332
00:19:50,377 --> 00:19:51,314
I'm good.

333
00:19:52,262 --> 00:19:54,545
All right. Let's go and
try to bring her home.

334
00:19:58,552 --> 00:20:00,365
It's like 110 out here

335
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:04,389
and it feels like a refrigerator
compared to their warehouse.

336
00:20:04,755 --> 00:20:06,079
How's Reid doing?

337
00:20:06,317 --> 00:20:07,905
It doesn't even seem to faze him.

338
00:20:07,947 --> 00:20:10,131
He's just sitting there
in a corner turning pages.

339
00:20:10,173 --> 00:20:12,439
Yeah, he goes to another
place when he reads.

340
00:20:12,604 --> 00:20:16,166
I've got the addresses of the major
tattoo parlors in Tallahassee.

341
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:19,455
That work is pretty detailed.
Someone might recognize it.

342
00:20:19,653 --> 00:20:21,627
You want to go check
these out with me?

343
00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:23,129
Sounds fun.

344
00:20:25,929 --> 00:20:28,906
Hey, so, uh, I got a few
more hours out of the media.

345
00:20:28,948 --> 00:20:31,100
Well, we'll take what we can get.

346
00:20:31,142 --> 00:20:34,013
Prentiss and Rossi are going to
check out some tattoo parlors.

347
00:20:34,684 --> 00:20:35,673
Is he OK?

348
00:20:36,674 --> 00:20:37,553
Yeah.

349
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,921
Did you ask him about
calling her Becky?

350
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:41,809
He'll be all right.

351
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,263
Well, I hope so.

352
00:20:43,305 --> 00:20:46,119
Because we still have no indication
that this girl's even alive.

353
00:20:51,113 --> 00:20:53,999
<i>I wasn't able To tie
up all the loose ends.</i>

354
00:20:54,084 --> 00:20:56,703
<i>You would have known
what was happening.</i>

355
00:20:56,745 --> 00:20:59,027
<i>So now it's left for you.</i>

356
00:21:00,354 --> 00:21:02,938
<i>Wait for night
and take it to the water.</i>

357
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:05,424
<i>The animals will do the rest.</i>

358
00:21:11,037 --> 00:21:13,153
This guy killed all those women?

359
00:21:13,527 --> 00:21:14,720
Looks like it.

360
00:21:14,862 --> 00:21:17,154
And there's another one missing.

361
00:21:17,648 --> 00:21:19,271
Then he killed himself?

362
00:21:19,816 --> 00:21:20,919
Yeah, he did.

363
00:21:20,951 --> 00:21:23,316
Good. Sort of a public service.

364
00:21:23,851 --> 00:21:26,079
I guess that's a good way
of looking at it.

365
00:21:26,189 --> 00:21:28,570
We send it to
the m.E. 's office in Tallahassee.

366
00:21:28,658 --> 00:21:29,570
You sign it?

367
00:21:29,617 --> 00:21:31,526
I'll take care of that,
later. Thanks.

368
00:21:31,557 --> 00:21:32,758
Thanks a lot.

369
00:21:35,081 --> 00:21:37,008
You sure it's OK to move the body?

370
00:21:37,605 --> 00:21:40,831
Well, there's no reason not to anymore.
We've seen this guy's show.

371
00:21:40,888 --> 00:21:43,162
Have you ever seen
anything like this before?

372
00:21:43,581 --> 00:21:44,892
Like what?

373
00:21:45,177 --> 00:21:47,587
Everything. The suicide,

374
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:50,448
The clippings, the journal.

375
00:21:51,966 --> 00:21:54,976
I think it's pretty safe to say that no
one's ever seen anything like this.

376
00:22:02,309 --> 00:22:04,193
Man, this is beautiful work.

377
00:22:04,402 --> 00:22:05,721
It's a body suit?

378
00:22:05,904 --> 00:22:07,301
He's completely covered?

379
00:22:07,332 --> 00:22:08,504
Pretty much.

380
00:22:09,449 --> 00:22:10,723
<i>"the illustrated man."</i>

381
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,426
Second time I've heard that today.

382
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:14,438
The book?
Reid mentioned it.

383
00:22:14,469 --> 00:22:17,307
Everybody in the body art
world knows that story.

384
00:22:17,383 --> 00:22:19,306
You said this dude killed himself?

385
00:22:19,354 --> 00:22:22,314
Did he, like, gash his
wrists open or something?

386
00:22:22,437 --> 00:22:26,523
The tattoos, could you
recognize who did this?

387
00:22:26,858 --> 00:22:29,326
I wish. I'd hire this
dude in a heartbeat.

388
00:22:29,456 --> 00:22:30,827
This looks free-hand.

389
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,231
Trust me, free-hand portraiture
is pretty gnarly to do on skin, man.

390
00:22:35,091 --> 00:22:36,466
Did he shoot himself?

391
00:22:36,497 --> 00:22:38,403
Because none of these
pictures have a head.

392
00:22:38,434 --> 00:22:41,515
Can you tell if the
same artist did these?

393
00:22:42,477 --> 00:22:43,721
It looks like it.

394
00:22:43,752 --> 00:22:47,019
But they weren't all done at the same
time. Some of the inks are newer.

395
00:22:47,134 --> 00:22:50,324
You know, if I saw the body,
I'd probably be able to tell you more.

396
00:22:50,398 --> 00:22:52,304
How about these?

397
00:22:53,829 --> 00:22:56,180
These are a lot of portraits.
What do they mean?

398
00:22:56,252 --> 00:22:58,796
That's what we're
trying to figure out.

399
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,138
Wait.

400
00:23:02,526 --> 00:23:04,060
That doesn't fit.

401
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,229
What doesn't?

402
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,247
There's something
under the rose there.

403
00:23:07,455 --> 00:23:09,568
Looks like...A cross?

404
00:23:09,992 --> 00:23:10,962
A big one.

405
00:23:10,993 --> 00:23:11,788
Where?

406
00:23:11,819 --> 00:23:13,156
Inside the rose.

407
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:15,086
And the work is sloppy.

408
00:23:15,265 --> 00:23:17,744
See that? They put the rose
over it to cover it up.

409
00:23:17,837 --> 00:23:19,004
Yeah, I see that.

410
00:23:19,035 --> 00:23:21,137
Yeah, that wasn't
done professionally.

411
00:23:21,187 --> 00:23:22,708
More like it was done in jail.

412
00:23:22,739 --> 00:23:24,061
If he did time,

413
00:23:24,092 --> 00:23:25,908
That would explain how
a 50-year-old unsub

414
00:23:25,939 --> 00:23:28,498
- Doesn't start killing until he's 40.
- This dude's a killer?

415
00:23:28,592 --> 00:23:30,949
And why rapists become killers
after they've been in prison.

416
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,673
They learn not to leave a witness.

417
00:23:32,704 --> 00:23:36,237
Garcia can track this through the
biometric recognition program.

418
00:23:36,399 --> 00:23:40,633
So, there's, like, no chance of
me seeing the dead dude, right?

419
00:23:41,172 --> 00:23:41,979
None.

420
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:44,913
Hey, p.G., I'm gonna send you
a photograph Of a tattoo.

421
00:23:45,197 --> 00:23:46,951
You know, that empty space

422
00:23:46,982 --> 00:23:50,048
<i>On his back makes him exactly like
"the illustrated man."</i>

423
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:51,814
I thought he was
covered completely.

424
00:23:51,845 --> 00:23:52,988
In the book.

425
00:23:53,105 --> 00:23:55,375
In the movie, there's an
open spot On his back,

426
00:23:55,546 --> 00:23:57,273
so you can see the future.

427
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:05,076
Rossi and Prentiss think
he may have done time

428
00:24:05,095 --> 00:24:07,108
And that one of the tattoos
may have been done in prison.

429
00:24:07,126 --> 00:24:08,141
That's a good bet.

430
00:24:08,172 --> 00:24:10,622
I've got Garcia running everything
Through the biometrics database.

431
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:11,486
Biometrics?

432
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:13,771
Yeah, it catalogues all the
prison inmates and their tattoos.

433
00:24:13,802 --> 00:24:16,223
They have detailed photos of
every one on every inmate.

434
00:24:25,607 --> 00:24:26,820
What happened?

435
00:24:27,286 --> 00:24:28,309
Shut up.

436
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:31,155
Please, sit down.

437
00:24:31,467 --> 00:24:32,984
You can tell me.

438
00:24:33,768 --> 00:24:35,196
We can sit down and

439
00:24:35,592 --> 00:24:38,548
We can talk about this. We could

440
00:24:39,551 --> 00:24:41,863
Wait! Please...

441
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:44,059
Can we please talk?

442
00:24:45,208 --> 00:24:47,928
My dad has to be so
worried about me.

443
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:50,665
Don't you have a father?

444
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,457
I don't have anyone anymore.

445
00:24:53,647 --> 00:24:54,716
Please...

446
00:24:55,582 --> 00:24:56,495
Just

447
00:24:56,969 --> 00:24:59,159
let me go before he comes back.

448
00:25:00,509 --> 00:25:02,024
He's not coming back.

449
00:25:04,706 --> 00:25:05,747
What?

450
00:25:07,036 --> 00:25:07,992
Wait.

451
00:25:09,943 --> 00:25:11,477
You can let me go.

452
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:13,794
What?

453
00:25:14,777 --> 00:25:15,948
It's just

454
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:18,007
I won't tell anyone what happened.

455
00:25:18,038 --> 00:25:20,291
I promise I won't tell anyone.

456
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:22,718
You won't tell anyone?

457
00:25:29,792 --> 00:25:32,207
I know you're afraid of him, too.

458
00:25:35,531 --> 00:25:37,581
You're not going to tell anyone

459
00:25:37,612 --> 00:25:40,345
Because you're never
leaving this room alive.

460
00:25:41,257 --> 00:25:42,407
I'm sorry.

461
00:25:42,972 --> 00:25:45,552
I'm so sorry...

462
00:25:45,583 --> 00:25:47,389
I was never afraid of him.

463
00:25:47,844 --> 00:25:49,032
I loved him.

464
00:25:49,063 --> 00:25:54,526
I would do anything,
I did anything for him.

465
00:25:54,784 --> 00:25:56,423
He was my masterpiece.

466
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:07,974
You're bleeding!

467
00:26:20,929 --> 00:26:24,029
I'll be able to fill in the
last space in my art collection.

468
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,911
The last space... Last space...
Last space...

469
00:26:26,942 --> 00:26:28,585
No, no, no, that's not right.

470
00:26:28,616 --> 00:26:30,467
Hey, guys, it isn't
the only blank space.

471
00:26:30,498 --> 00:26:31,527
What do you mean?

472
00:26:31,546 --> 00:26:33,164
The spot on his chest
where we assumed

473
00:26:33,176 --> 00:26:34,490
Rebecca's
portrait would go

474
00:26:34,527 --> 00:26:36,661
In the journal he talks about
filling in the last space,

475
00:26:36,689 --> 00:26:38,730
How once he does that the
artwork will be complete.

476
00:26:38,758 --> 00:26:40,307
And?
It isn't the only blank space.

477
00:26:40,345 --> 00:26:42,833
In his back, in the middle of
that tree Is a giant open spot.

478
00:26:42,864 --> 00:26:45,494
Why would he talk about completing
the artwork when he hasn't?

479
00:26:45,903 --> 00:26:47,491
I need to see the body again.

480
00:26:47,529 --> 00:26:48,550
I'll go with you.

481
00:26:48,581 --> 00:26:50,857
I'll call the M.E. and let him
know You're on your way.

482
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:53,839
I ran the covered tattoo through
the morpho tracking system.

483
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:55,376
Tell me you got something, babe.

484
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:57,346
Emily, don't get ahead
of my dramatic telling.

485
00:26:57,377 --> 00:26:59,644
I analyzed color,
design, and texture.

486
00:26:59,675 --> 00:27:03,409
There's a 95% chance it is from
one of 4 major institutions

487
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,335
In the northeastern prison system.

488
00:27:05,366 --> 00:27:08,520
The string of missings
began unbroken from 2000,

489
00:27:08,551 --> 00:27:10,088
So I went back from that year,

490
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:13,792
Found 53 similar
tattoos on forearms.

491
00:27:13,823 --> 00:27:17,411
Of those 53, 10 were released Prior
to 2000. Thank you and good night.

492
00:27:17,827 --> 00:27:18,997
You are amazing.

493
00:27:19,028 --> 00:27:21,529
Of the 10, any convicted rapists?

494
00:27:22,498 --> 00:27:23,324
4.

495
00:27:23,688 --> 00:27:26,331
Do any of them trace
back To Tallahassee?

496
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:28,696
None.

497
00:27:29,386 --> 00:27:30,955
So ultimately I have Nada.

498
00:27:31,732 --> 00:27:32,609
Bob.

499
00:27:32,708 --> 00:27:36,127
Oh, the guy, his name,
the guy who rented the property,

500
00:27:36,214 --> 00:27:37,543
Just Bob.

501
00:27:37,761 --> 00:27:38,583
Ok, OK.

502
00:27:38,614 --> 00:27:42,220
I have a Robert Matthew Burke,
Convicted in 1991, 8 years for rape,

503
00:27:42,251 --> 00:27:44,272
Released October of '99.

504
00:27:44,418 --> 00:27:46,507
And the missings began in 2000.

505
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:49,631
Garcia, remind me never
to try to hide from you.

506
00:27:50,521 --> 00:27:52,313
perish the thought, Mon Ami.

507
00:27:53,543 --> 00:27:55,219
Hotch, we got the name.

508
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:57,435
The unsub's name is
Robert Matthew Burke.

509
00:27:57,466 --> 00:27:58,405
Burke?

510
00:27:58,467 --> 00:27:59,568
You know him?

511
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,521
Burke. Yeah.
I know the name.

512
00:28:02,987 --> 00:28:03,995
Damn it!

513
00:28:04,578 --> 00:28:07,348
He's a registered sex offender.
He's an ex-con out of Virginia.

514
00:28:07,379 --> 00:28:10,246
He got a traffic ticket near FSU
the night Rebecca disappeared.

515
00:28:10,277 --> 00:28:11,718
He's one of my suspects.

516
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:14,578
I--I went to his apartment,
I don't know, a couple times

517
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:17,564
In the past 3 weeks to try to interview
him, But I could never catch up with him

518
00:28:17,602 --> 00:28:19,368
Did he know you were
looking for him?

519
00:28:19,399 --> 00:28:21,308
Well, yeah, I talked
to him on the phone.

520
00:28:21,339 --> 00:28:24,054
He's scheduled to come down for an
interview and a DNA swab on Monday.

521
00:28:24,085 --> 00:28:25,161
That's what changed.

522
00:28:25,189 --> 00:28:27,180
He knew it was only a matter of
time before you caught up to him.

523
00:28:27,227 --> 00:28:29,024
And he wasn't about
to go back to prison.

524
00:28:29,071 --> 00:28:30,538
Do you have his address?

525
00:28:31,675 --> 00:28:34,173
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

526
00:28:34,662 --> 00:28:37,429
Something's wrong.
Something's wrong.

527
00:28:38,741 --> 00:28:39,983
Unchain me.

528
00:28:45,501 --> 00:28:48,543
Unchain me and I will help you.

529
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:50,568
I am not stupid.

530
00:28:52,143 --> 00:28:53,692
Your baby needs help.

531
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,847
Wait! You can't--

532
00:29:11,063 --> 00:29:12,232
The collar.

533
00:29:12,734 --> 00:29:15,575
You help me and I'll let you go.

534
00:29:16,026 --> 00:29:16,874
Ok.

535
00:29:18,586 --> 00:29:20,246
Ok. Ok.

536
00:29:29,283 --> 00:29:30,262
FBI!

537
00:29:36,962 --> 00:29:37,985
Damn it.

538
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:42,937
If these tattoos are a fetish,

539
00:29:42,968 --> 00:29:45,206
What enjoyment does he get
out of the ones on his back?

540
00:29:45,237 --> 00:29:46,841
He can't even see them.

541
00:29:46,872 --> 00:29:50,554
You know what? There's something here.
I can feel the raised ink.

542
00:29:51,544 --> 00:29:54,232
Do you have a black light scanner?

543
00:29:54,567 --> 00:29:55,566
Thanks.

544
00:29:56,916 --> 00:29:59,384
Right there. Feel that.

545
00:29:59,385 --> 00:30:01,152
Yeah, what is that?

546
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,188
Thanks.

547
00:30:04,651 --> 00:30:07,325
I've read about this.
Tattoos put on with invisible ink

548
00:30:07,326 --> 00:30:09,928
So that no one can see them.

549
00:30:09,929 --> 00:30:11,196
Oh, man.

550
00:30:12,898 --> 00:30:16,231
Can you, uh, turn the
lights down? Thanks.

551
00:30:19,572 --> 00:30:22,344
Look, there's one over here, too.

552
00:30:22,708 --> 00:30:25,143
They're all connected
to the faces.

553
00:30:25,144 --> 00:30:27,612
They lead to the blank spot.

554
00:30:27,613 --> 00:30:29,247
Ow, wow. What is that?

555
00:30:29,248 --> 00:30:32,650
It's an embryo in a womb.

556
00:30:34,266 --> 00:30:37,555
The partner's a woman,
and they're having a baby.

557
00:30:37,556 --> 00:30:39,691
Oh, my God!

558
00:30:40,726 --> 00:30:43,943
There's more blood.
I don't know what I'm doing.

559
00:30:44,493 --> 00:30:45,692
It...It won't stop.

560
00:30:45,812 --> 00:30:49,000
It won't stop.
I don't know what to do!

561
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,102
It won't stop. I don't--

562
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,856
Help me.

563
00:30:53,246 --> 00:30:54,839
Do we know if she
had the baby yet?

564
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,975
The tattoos have dates,
the embryo doesn't.

565
00:30:56,976 --> 00:30:59,043
Dating is prominent in the
tattoos and the journals

566
00:30:59,077 --> 00:31:01,927
And they're calendrical in their abductions.
It's hard to believe their baby's birthdate

567
00:31:02,047 --> 00:31:03,381
Wouldn't be exceedingly
important to them.

568
00:31:03,382 --> 00:31:05,316
Then she's probably
still pregnant.

569
00:31:05,317 --> 00:31:08,300
Well, he didn't live here with a pregnant
woman. This is a males-only SRO.

570
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,988
No, she has to have
a house, anyway.

571
00:31:09,989 --> 00:31:11,122
How do you know that?

572
00:31:11,123 --> 00:31:12,795
They kept these women
for a year each.

573
00:31:12,915 --> 00:31:14,259
It wasn't in a one-room apartment.

574
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:17,428
Everyone get back here. We need to
update the profile and narrow the search.

575
00:31:17,429 --> 00:31:19,597
push. Push.

576
00:31:19,598 --> 00:31:21,532
Push! Push!

577
00:31:21,533 --> 00:31:22,681
It's almost--

578
00:31:22,686 --> 00:31:24,346
It's almost there.
Just keep pushing.

579
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:25,775
I see the head! I can't.

580
00:31:25,895 --> 00:31:27,521
One more time, that's it!

581
00:31:35,218 --> 00:31:36,547
Hi.

582
00:31:42,521 --> 00:31:44,355
Please...

583
00:31:44,475 --> 00:31:46,222
Tell me it's a girl.

584
00:31:46,342 --> 00:31:47,546
What?

585
00:31:48,827 --> 00:31:50,528
It can't be a boy.

586
00:31:51,223 --> 00:31:52,088
Please.

587
00:31:54,533 --> 00:31:55,373
It--

588
00:32:01,206 --> 00:32:03,046
You have a son.

589
00:32:06,712 --> 00:32:08,312
It can't be a boy.

590
00:32:12,694 --> 00:32:14,085
It can't be a boy.

591
00:32:14,086 --> 00:32:15,285
Get it away from me.

592
00:32:15,286 --> 00:32:17,441
You need to take him.
I don't want it.

593
00:32:17,932 --> 00:32:21,562
He'll hurt me like they all do.

594
00:32:22,394 --> 00:32:27,165
I felt for sure I
was having a girl.

595
00:32:29,886 --> 00:32:32,540
You gotta get me out of here.

596
00:32:34,061 --> 00:32:37,132
You have to get me out of here!

597
00:32:39,842 --> 00:32:42,355
Help us!

598
00:32:42,673 --> 00:32:45,103
Help us!

599
00:32:47,285 --> 00:32:48,849
I know.

600
00:32:52,864 --> 00:32:55,096
You're a sweetheart.

601
00:32:57,711 --> 00:32:59,487
it's OK.

602
00:32:59,518 --> 00:33:01,190
The partner being
pregnant can help us.

603
00:33:01,193 --> 00:33:03,990
We should have Garcia try and find
her through doctor visits or medical records.

604
00:33:04,026 --> 00:33:05,884
He basically lived off the grid,

605
00:33:05,885 --> 00:33:07,352
Which means she did, too.

606
00:33:07,353 --> 00:33:10,088
Judging by the photographs of
what they did to the victims,

607
00:33:10,089 --> 00:33:12,223
It's safe to say they
live in isolation.

608
00:33:12,224 --> 00:33:15,560
We've seen his hatred for women,
and yet he teams up with her.

609
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:17,729
What kind of woman
could change him?

610
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:19,300
You think they met in prison?

611
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,266
Garcia already went
through all of that.

612
00:33:21,267 --> 00:33:22,600
He had no female visitors.

613
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:26,271
What about prison staff,
doctors, religious volunteers?

614
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:28,514
We went through a long
list of all the vendors

615
00:33:28,557 --> 00:33:30,308
Who were there during
his incarceration.

616
00:33:30,309 --> 00:33:32,410
None of them resurfaced
in Tallahassee.

617
00:33:32,411 --> 00:33:35,174
What kind of a woman would go to
a prison to fall in love with a rapist?

618
00:33:35,622 --> 00:33:39,384
Someone vulnerable, emotionally fragile,
drawn to violent men.

619
00:33:39,385 --> 00:33:42,754
Someone in her life made her that way.
Classic abuse cycle.

620
00:33:42,755 --> 00:33:44,416
What if that's who she
was there to visit?

621
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:45,553
It's worth a try.

622
00:33:45,994 --> 00:33:46,791
my sweet.

623
00:33:46,792 --> 00:33:49,346
Hey, you know the visitor logs
From the prison we looked at?

624
00:33:49,397 --> 00:33:51,035
Uh-huh. Still have
them at the ready.

625
00:33:51,077 --> 00:33:53,162
Ok, great. I need you
to check dates for me.

626
00:33:53,163 --> 00:33:57,266
Were there any women who visited
another inmate while Burke was there

627
00:33:57,267 --> 00:33:59,869
But then suddenly stopped
visiting when Burke was released?

628
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:03,139
Huh. Ok, let me hit you back.

629
00:34:03,618 --> 00:34:06,680
It's OK. It's OK.

630
00:34:07,417 --> 00:34:09,906
I can't help you!

631
00:34:21,591 --> 00:34:24,550
it's OK...

632
00:34:26,795 --> 00:34:28,070
Rev your engines, guys.

633
00:34:28,071 --> 00:34:30,267
Juliet Monroe went to
visit her father in prison

634
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:33,058
Once or twice a year
from '92 to '95.

635
00:34:33,059 --> 00:34:34,247
What was he in for?

636
00:34:34,248 --> 00:34:36,597
Rape. And she was
his primary victim.

637
00:34:36,598 --> 00:34:38,846
He raped her and she still
went to visit him every year?

638
00:34:38,847 --> 00:34:40,931
She's repeating the
cycle she grew up with.

639
00:34:40,932 --> 00:34:43,385
Yeah. And she went from visiting
him once or twice a year

640
00:34:43,505 --> 00:34:45,928
To once a month from '95 to '97.

641
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:47,905
When Burke was serving
his time for rape.

642
00:34:48,025 --> 00:34:50,408
Yeah. And then she increased
her visits to once a week

643
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:53,508
All through '98 and '99,
until they stopped completely

644
00:34:53,509 --> 00:34:54,763
In October of that year.

645
00:34:54,883 --> 00:34:55,990
That's when he was released.

646
00:34:55,991 --> 00:34:57,735
And if you want me to
slip you some convincers,

647
00:34:57,736 --> 00:34:59,393
She owns a house in
Northern Florida.

648
00:34:59,394 --> 00:35:01,591
Garcia, get us the address.

649
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:17,884
Rossi and I will take the front.
Take the side.

650
00:35:21,103 --> 00:35:21,960
Go.

651
00:35:29,831 --> 00:35:31,331
In here!

652
00:35:31,332 --> 00:35:32,832
Please help. In here!

653
00:35:33,906 --> 00:35:35,397
In here.

654
00:35:35,398 --> 00:35:37,605
The baby. The baby.

655
00:35:38,406 --> 00:35:40,194
She's--she's--she's--

656
00:35:40,314 --> 00:35:41,450
She's dead.

657
00:35:43,577 --> 00:35:45,020
All right, give me the baby.

658
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,813
Give me the baby. I got him.

659
00:35:46,814 --> 00:35:49,209
You're gonna be all right.

660
00:35:50,334 --> 00:35:52,036
Help me.

661
00:35:54,338 --> 00:35:56,706
Becky, are you OK?

662
00:35:58,142 --> 00:36:01,951
I just want to go home.

663
00:36:02,073 --> 00:36:05,295
I just want to go home.

664
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:07,866
Yeah, you're going home, honey.

665
00:36:07,867 --> 00:36:10,289
You're going home. It's OK.

666
00:36:13,409 --> 00:36:14,887
So, I talked to your parents.

667
00:36:14,888 --> 00:36:17,664
They're gonna meet you
at the hospital, OK?

668
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:22,216
Is the baby OK?

669
00:36:22,217 --> 00:36:25,184
Oh, yeah, he's-
he's in another ambulance.

670
00:36:25,185 --> 00:36:26,752
What's gonna happen to him?

671
00:36:26,753 --> 00:36:31,573
Hey, don't you worry. We're gonna
take real good care of him, OK?

672
00:36:32,321 --> 00:36:34,568
Ma'am, we should get going.

673
00:36:35,298 --> 00:36:36,375
Ok. Take care.

674
00:36:39,549 --> 00:36:41,170
It'll be OK.

675
00:36:47,234 --> 00:36:49,535
She gonna be OK?

676
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:53,312
I wouldn't bet against anybody
who survived what she did.

677
00:36:53,313 --> 00:36:55,314
How about you?

678
00:36:55,315 --> 00:36:58,274
Oh, yeah, you know,
nothing's gonna affect me.

679
00:36:58,275 --> 00:37:02,555
You know, we wouldn't be here if you
hadn't worked the case as hard as you did.

680
00:37:02,556 --> 00:37:03,686
How's that?

681
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:06,657
It would have been an easy thing
To miss a routine traffic ticket

682
00:37:06,658 --> 00:37:08,828
In the area she disappeared.

683
00:37:08,829 --> 00:37:11,181
You kept the pressure on.

684
00:37:11,182 --> 00:37:14,867
You cleared 9 homicides and
you brought Becky home.

685
00:37:14,868 --> 00:37:17,803
It's impressive work, Detective.

686
00:37:20,544 --> 00:37:21,443
Thanks.

687
00:37:40,197 --> 00:37:42,210
3 cards, please.

688
00:37:42,211 --> 00:37:44,606
3 cards for the lady.

689
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,967
And I'm gonna take one card.

690
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:50,142
One card.

691
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:53,178
A straight or a flush, Dr.
Reid, what are you trying to fill in?

692
00:37:53,179 --> 00:37:55,673
Well, considering the odds of
filling in an open-ended straight

693
00:37:55,674 --> 00:37:59,185
with one card Are 5-to-1 against,
while a one-card flush draw

694
00:37:59,186 --> 00:38:03,453
Is more like 4.5-to-1,
I guess you'd say if I was smart,

695
00:38:03,454 --> 00:38:06,419
I'm drawing to a flush.

696
00:38:07,097 --> 00:38:10,289
I think I'm gonna
go all in on this.

697
00:38:18,276 --> 00:38:20,607
So, are you?

698
00:38:20,608 --> 00:38:23,390
Am I drawing to a flush,
or am I smart?

699
00:38:23,391 --> 00:38:26,360
Either. Well,
I'm-- I'm provably a genius,

700
00:38:26,361 --> 00:38:30,708
But, uh, actually,
I was drawing to a full house.

701
00:38:30,709 --> 00:38:32,572
8s over 6s.

702
00:38:33,493 --> 00:38:35,193
I always forget you're from Vegas.

703
00:38:35,194 --> 00:38:36,194
Yup.

704
00:38:36,195 --> 00:38:37,529
Ooh, I'm sorry, not so fast.

705
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:39,765
I, too, have a boat.

706
00:38:39,766 --> 00:38:41,884
Jacks over 3s.

707
00:38:42,004 --> 00:38:43,602
You drew 3 cards to a full house?

708
00:38:43,603 --> 00:38:45,504
That's like 100-to-1 against.

709
00:38:45,505 --> 00:38:47,139
97-to-1.

710
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:50,375
Looks like you're out.

711
00:38:50,376 --> 00:38:52,377
Hey, Prentiss.

712
00:38:52,378 --> 00:38:53,812
Sin to win.

713
00:38:54,601 --> 00:38:55,774
I'm sorry, what?

714
00:38:55,775 --> 00:38:57,493
Come on, now, I gotta know.

715
00:38:57,494 --> 00:39:01,153
What the hell is a sin to win
weekend in Atlantic city?

716
00:39:03,929 --> 00:39:07,300
Derek, I have a tremendous
amount of respect for you,

717
00:39:07,301 --> 00:39:11,553
But there's some questions
that if you have to ask them,

718
00:39:11,554 --> 00:39:15,273
It means you probably
couldn't handle the answer.

719
00:39:18,913 --> 00:39:20,945
There is a whole other
side to that woman.

720
00:39:20,946 --> 00:39:22,201
I never lose.

721
00:39:22,202 --> 00:39:24,377
A whole other side.

722
00:39:25,351 --> 00:39:29,087
I know environment plays a
bigger role than genetics

723
00:39:29,088 --> 00:39:30,955
When it comes to determining
a child's future,

724
00:39:30,956 --> 00:39:33,829
But that baby, I mean,
both the parents.

725
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,994
How many other serial
killers had kids?

726
00:39:35,995 --> 00:39:38,541
A lot. Manson has like
10 or 11 children.

727
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,065
Albert fish had 6.

728
00:39:40,066 --> 00:39:41,833
Gary Ridgeway had a son.

729
00:39:41,834 --> 00:39:45,581
Fred and Rosemary West Had 7
children living in the home

730
00:39:45,582 --> 00:39:47,002
Where they killed 10 women.

731
00:39:47,003 --> 00:39:48,179
Including one of the children.

732
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,800
Ok, so, the baby's gonna be OK?

733
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:54,546
Most likely. If he grows
up in a good home.

734
00:39:55,329 --> 00:39:58,450
Loved, cared for.

735
00:39:59,285 --> 00:40:00,800
Good.

736
00:40:04,323 --> 00:40:05,724
Gandhi said,

737
00:40:05,725 --> 00:40:08,626
"I have seen children
successfully surmount the effects

738
00:40:08,627 --> 00:40:10,095
"of an evil inheritance.

739
00:40:10,096 --> 00:40:12,964
"that is due to purity
being an inherent attribute

740
00:40:12,965 --> 00:40:14,432
Of the soul."
