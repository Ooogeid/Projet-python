1
00:00:18,274 --> 00:00:19,796
now,
from these experiments,

2
00:00:19,871 --> 00:00:21,434
A few factors became evident.

3
00:00:21,501 --> 00:00:23,338
One was the realization

4
00:00:23,403 --> 00:00:26,161
That serial killers have been with
us Since the dawn of man.

5
00:00:26,267 --> 00:00:27,567
Please, let him go.

6
00:00:27,634 --> 00:00:29,604
Take whatever you want,
take anything,

7
00:00:29,641 --> 00:00:31,431
But please let my son go.

8
00:00:31,478 --> 00:00:33,378
My name is
professor james fallon.

9
00:00:33,406 --> 00:00:35,734
I'm a scientist--
neuroscientist--

10
00:00:35,801 --> 00:00:37,400
And i study the human brain.

11
00:00:37,781 --> 00:00:40,823
It is a complex
and sometimes lethal machine.

12
00:00:40,945 --> 00:00:42,734
In a blind experiment,
colleagues sent me

13
00:00:42,801 --> 00:00:44,400
70 mri brain scans,

14
00:00:44,467 --> 00:00:47,119
And i had no idea
who these brains belonged to.

15
00:00:47,185 --> 00:00:49,749
Some were normals,
some were schizophrenics,

16
00:00:49,824 --> 00:00:51,400
And some were killers.

17
00:00:51,715 --> 00:00:53,233
I analyzed all of them,

18
00:00:53,289 --> 00:00:57,000
5 of which i determined
were the brains of psychopaths.

19
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:58,786
And it turned out
that, indeed,

20
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:01,801
These 5 were the brains
of serial killers,

21
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,487
Some of whom you know.

22
00:01:14,515 --> 00:01:15,767
In studies such as these,

23
00:01:16,187 --> 00:01:18,034
One looks at
the biological factors...

24
00:01:18,062 --> 00:01:21,158
That is, the genetics
and also the brain pathology.

25
00:01:21,261 --> 00:01:23,253
The 5 brains we identified

26
00:01:23,366 --> 00:01:25,551
All had damage
to the orbital cortex,

27
00:01:25,598 --> 00:01:27,100
Which is right above the eyes.

28
00:01:27,167 --> 00:01:30,400
Now, high-risk allele
of the monoamine oxidase a,

29
00:01:30,467 --> 00:01:32,434
The MAOA gene

30
00:01:32,501 --> 00:01:34,434
May also be present
in these people,

31
00:01:34,501 --> 00:01:35,505
And that's key.

32
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,434
Now, under the effects
of the high-risk gene,

33
00:01:37,501 --> 00:01:39,684
The brain of the psychopath
was bathed

34
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:43,031
In way too much serotonin
during fetal development.

35
00:01:43,106 --> 00:01:44,344
As an adult,

36
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:47,099
This brain is now numb

37
00:01:47,897 --> 00:01:50,300
To seratonin's calming effects.

38
00:01:50,617 --> 00:01:53,234
The first dangerous elements
are now in place.

39
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:55,423
The damage is done.

40
00:01:56,046 --> 00:01:58,985
Now, this is a recipe
for catastrophe.

41
00:01:59,968 --> 00:02:02,501
So when the fetus reaches
the day of labor,

42
00:02:02,567 --> 00:02:05,198
The potential
serial killer is born.

43
00:02:10,033 --> 00:02:10,775
Mom!

44
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:13,416
Mom!

45
00:03:12,504 --> 00:03:14,167
hey, how was your weekend?

46
00:03:14,234 --> 00:03:17,288
Scary yet informative.
was the whole family killed?

47
00:03:17,382 --> 00:03:19,649
Hudson, this is
dr. spencer reid.

48
00:03:19,687 --> 00:03:21,000
Field agent anne hudson.

49
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,926
The, uh, father
is serving in iraq.

50
00:03:22,983 --> 00:03:25,810
3 nights ago the cops found
his family buried over there.

51
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:26,608
Buried?

52
00:03:26,645 --> 00:03:28,524
The neighbors heard
the dog barking, came over,

53
00:03:28,561 --> 00:03:30,149
And he was scratching
at the grave.

54
00:03:30,186 --> 00:03:32,623
Lucy, their oldest child,
she's still in her swimsuit.

55
00:03:32,717 --> 00:03:33,994
What does the father know?

56
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:36,243
Hudson: some of it.
he was on patrol.

57
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:38,305
Took his unit a couple
of days to reach him.

58
00:03:38,371 --> 00:03:39,434
He arrives today.

59
00:03:39,501 --> 00:03:40,874
Last year
the williams family

60
00:03:40,911 --> 00:03:43,016
Was killed and found
exactly the same way.

61
00:03:43,091 --> 00:03:44,600
They lived in newport news.

62
00:03:44,619 --> 00:03:47,049
The father, dan williams,
was also serving overseas.

63
00:03:47,134 --> 00:03:48,656
Now, the police
are overwhelmed

64
00:03:48,675 --> 00:03:50,534
And getting serious heat
from the military.

65
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:51,879
We need some answers fast.

66
00:03:51,926 --> 00:03:52,958
As do the media.

67
00:03:52,995 --> 00:03:55,510
They're already calling this
the work of a serial killer.

68
00:03:55,632 --> 00:03:56,964
They're right. it is.

69
00:03:57,067 --> 00:03:58,304
But why bury them?

70
00:03:58,436 --> 00:04:00,916
I mean, it can't be
to hide the bodies.

71
00:04:01,038 --> 00:04:02,601
It's a sign of remorse.

72
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:05,046
And when they're done
being remorseful,

73
00:04:05,628 --> 00:04:07,436
This will happen again.

74
00:04:12,376 --> 00:04:42,229
Criminal Team
http://experts.heberg-forum.net/

75
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:03,185
"man usually avoids
attributing cleverness
to somebody else,

76
00:05:03,251 --> 00:05:04,772
Unless it's an enemy."

77
00:05:05,345 --> 00:05:06,828
Albert einstein.

78
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,757
no sign of a struggle.

79
00:05:12,467 --> 00:05:15,658
Unsub holds a gun
to one of her kids' head.

80
00:05:16,034 --> 00:05:17,395
What can she do?

81
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,759
Footprints belong to paul.

82
00:05:19,867 --> 00:05:21,877
Somehow he managed to get away.

83
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:24,891
Mom gets it first,
then the youngest.

84
00:05:25,632 --> 00:05:27,350
He hides in the master bedroom,

85
00:05:27,435 --> 00:05:29,369
The unsub finds him
and shoots him.

86
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,773
And carries him out
to the backyard.

87
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,453
But not the mother.
she's dragged out.

88
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,753
It's quick and proficient.

89
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:38,752
For the mother
and the boys, maybe.

90
00:05:38,926 --> 00:05:41,066
But lucy's drowned
and not shot.

91
00:05:41,395 --> 00:05:43,048
Why the change in m.o.?

92
00:05:50,241 --> 00:05:51,601
f-22 raptor.

93
00:05:51,668 --> 00:05:55,323
Yeah. it's about to get
way louder and much busier.

94
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:58,938
Tomorrow is langley's
50th anniversary air show.

95
00:05:59,417 --> 00:06:02,000
The father of the first
family killed--dan williams,

96
00:06:02,067 --> 00:06:04,893
- Where is he now?
- He put in for another tour of iraq.

97
00:06:04,996 --> 00:06:07,043
An i.e.d. killed him
2 months ago.

98
00:06:08,712 --> 00:06:11,334
Whoever did this Knew both fathers
were serving overseas.

99
00:06:11,401 --> 00:06:13,186
Laura downey's wedding rings
are missing.

100
00:06:13,223 --> 00:06:14,453
Any other valuables?

101
00:06:14,482 --> 00:06:15,862
We'll have to ask the husband.

102
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:17,296
From the williams home,

103
00:06:17,324 --> 00:06:19,108
Only jewelry and watches
were missing.

104
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:20,835
The unsub only took
what he can carry,

105
00:06:20,882 --> 00:06:22,469
Which means he's most
likely on foot.

106
00:06:22,488 --> 00:06:24,353
There was a photo
on the wall in the kitchen.

107
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,759
- I'd like to see it.
- Sure.

108
00:06:25,767 --> 00:06:27,924
There's no sign of sexual assault
In the williams case.

109
00:06:27,961 --> 00:06:28,975
what about lucy?

110
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:30,734
Nothing on
the coroner's report.

111
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,834
Multiple suspects?

112
00:06:31,871 --> 00:06:33,561
The mother was dragged
out of the house.

113
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,144
If it had been multiple suspects,
They probably would have carried her.

114
00:06:36,172 --> 00:06:38,779
He knew the father was absent, Therefore
the dominant threat was absent.

115
00:06:38,807 --> 00:06:40,624
So we could be looking
for a single suspect.

116
00:06:40,626 --> 00:06:41,868
No sign of forced entry.

117
00:06:41,905 --> 00:06:43,967
No need.
lucy was in the pool,

118
00:06:44,068 --> 00:06:46,115
Back door was open.
the unsub walked right in.

119
00:06:46,154 --> 00:06:47,713
That means lucy
probably died last.

120
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,589
In both cases the girls
were suffocated

121
00:06:49,645 --> 00:06:51,927
And not shot.
i don't think
it's a coincidence.

122
00:06:52,014 --> 00:06:53,971
Hey, garcia.
you're on speaker.

123
00:06:54,018 --> 00:06:56,514
We just got a call From virginia
super max prison.

124
00:06:56,563 --> 00:06:57,900
One of the inmates there

125
00:06:57,967 --> 00:07:00,278
Has received 2 envelopes
in the last 2 days.

126
00:07:00,306 --> 00:07:03,311
First envelope had clippings
of the newport news killings.

127
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,255
Second envelope had media
clippings of the downey family.

128
00:07:06,283 --> 00:07:08,302
In the second envelope
was a note saying,

129
00:07:08,358 --> 00:07:10,330
"look at what i've done,"
and both pieces of mail

130
00:07:10,377 --> 00:07:11,954
Have been signed by
"an admirer."

131
00:07:11,982 --> 00:07:13,034
Who's the inmate?

132
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,611
That's the part that...

133
00:07:16,167 --> 00:07:17,290
Karl arnold.

134
00:07:17,522 --> 00:07:19,400
- The fox?
- he's back.

135
00:07:19,787 --> 00:07:21,004
Ok, thanks.

136
00:07:21,361 --> 00:07:24,483
Family annihilator, absent father,
wedding rings. It's similar.

137
00:07:24,549 --> 00:07:25,432
To what?

138
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:28,574
4 years ago, karl arnold,
aka the fox, Killed 8 families.

139
00:07:28,621 --> 00:07:30,415
Just like this case,
he took wedding rings,

140
00:07:30,462 --> 00:07:31,900
Only he took them
as trophies.

141
00:07:31,967 --> 00:07:34,479
he'd hide in the bushes
outside the homes.

142
00:07:35,174 --> 00:07:38,206
And i watched them...
for a number of days.

143
00:07:39,238 --> 00:07:40,477
Always at night.

144
00:07:41,588 --> 00:07:43,156
Saw how they lived...

145
00:07:45,104 --> 00:07:46,278
How they loved.

146
00:07:46,494 --> 00:07:49,336
I would keep them apart
until the last night.

147
00:07:50,367 --> 00:07:52,735
Then i would bring them,
one by one,

148
00:07:53,177 --> 00:07:54,595
Down to the basement,

149
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,366
The youngest first.

150
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,155
The father last.

151
00:07:59,221 --> 00:08:00,263
Why, karl?

152
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,222
So he could see
what happens...

153
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:05,963
To families

154
00:08:07,267 --> 00:08:09,752
When the head of household
isn't strong.

155
00:08:12,772 --> 00:08:13,589
Wives

156
00:08:14,978 --> 00:08:15,880
wither...

157
00:08:16,861 --> 00:08:18,232
Children perish.

158
00:08:18,316 --> 00:08:20,664
So, we're working with
a copycat here?

159
00:08:20,711 --> 00:08:22,373
It's too early
to assume anything.

160
00:08:22,429 --> 00:08:23,754
It could bias the profile.

161
00:08:23,829 --> 00:08:26,815
Not to mention the police,
the media, and the military

162
00:08:26,862 --> 00:08:28,158
Would jump all over it.

163
00:08:28,214 --> 00:08:31,247
Until we're positive,
none of this information
leaves the 7 of us.

164
00:08:31,294 --> 00:08:33,369
Hotch, you gave evidence
at arnold's trial.

165
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:34,787
I think you should go see him.

166
00:08:34,843 --> 00:08:36,355
I'd like to take
prentiss with me.

167
00:08:36,411 --> 00:08:37,228
Let's go.

168
00:08:37,275 --> 00:08:39,534
Have garcia check on all of arnold's
prison correspondence

169
00:08:39,601 --> 00:08:41,134
And visitors for
the last 4 years.

170
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,209
Ok. captain joseph downey
has arrived back at the station.

171
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,299
Captain downey,
please, sit.

172
00:08:50,093 --> 00:08:51,539
Thank you, i'm fine.

173
00:08:53,348 --> 00:08:54,869
Tell me everything.

174
00:08:57,706 --> 00:09:00,683
At around 9:30
3 nights ago,

175
00:09:01,364 --> 00:09:03,523
Your neighbors called
police when...

176
00:09:06,108 --> 00:09:07,104
I'm sorry.

177
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:13,351
Sir.

178
00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:17,273
We believe it was the work
of a serial killer.

179
00:09:19,034 --> 00:09:22,802
I'm sorry. my neighbors,
jack and penny--

180
00:09:23,264 --> 00:09:24,567
Captain downey...

181
00:09:25,544 --> 00:09:27,291
Your family was murdered.

182
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:28,863
All of them.

183
00:09:31,005 --> 00:09:33,268
Is there someone
you'd like us to call?

184
00:09:34,301 --> 00:09:37,567
Uh, call, um--no, no.
i, uh...

185
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,709
I--i'd like to go home now.

186
00:09:42,188 --> 00:09:44,601
Captain downey.
captain downey. captain d--

187
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:45,325
Ok.

188
00:09:46,731 --> 00:09:47,868
I'm sorry.

189
00:09:49,095 --> 00:09:50,400
I'm so sorry.

190
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,433
So why wait a year
to send karl a note,

191
00:10:16,508 --> 00:10:18,362
Unless they were
communicating the whole time?

192
00:10:18,398 --> 00:10:20,620
That's the first thing
we need to find out.

193
00:10:20,733 --> 00:10:22,423
But karl has a big ego.

194
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,235
He's gonna want to answer
a question with a question.

195
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:27,034
The first thing
he's gonna want to know

196
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,833
Is why i'm not wearing
my wedding ring.

197
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,026
And then he will turn
his attention to you.

198
00:10:31,111 --> 00:10:33,303
So that's why you
brought me along.

199
00:10:33,534 --> 00:10:35,928
Your presence
will throw him off guard.

200
00:10:36,597 --> 00:10:39,273
Then he's gonna want
to describe to you in graphic detail

201
00:10:39,367 --> 00:10:41,882
Every sexual act
he committed with the families.

202
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,299
To freak me out?

203
00:10:43,595 --> 00:10:45,301
To pull you into
his fantasy.

204
00:10:45,537 --> 00:10:47,095
Control, open on 16.

205
00:10:54,058 --> 00:10:55,579
Keep your eyes forward.

206
00:10:58,093 --> 00:11:00,933
More than anything, he's going to want
to see the images of the children.

207
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,703
We can't give him that.

208
00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:05,949
We have to give him something
or we'll get nothing from him.

209
00:11:07,088 --> 00:11:08,299
Come on!

210
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:15,653
Isn't that,

211
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,668
Garrett pain that's reinforced glass.

212
00:11:17,734 --> 00:11:20,501
Easy for you to say.
he tore apart 14 women.

213
00:11:20,567 --> 00:11:21,815
Open on 15.

214
00:11:29,327 --> 00:11:30,350
Hello, karl.

215
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:32,632
Agent hotchner.

216
00:11:34,715 --> 00:11:37,367
I wasn't informed
you were bring in a,

217
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,921
They just said two agents.

218
00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:43,935
- This is agent
- Emily...

219
00:11:45,567 --> 00:11:46,554
Prentiss.

220
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,284
I know all about you.

221
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:56,861
If this unsub's copying the fox,
Then we profile him like the fox.

222
00:11:56,889 --> 00:12:00,182
Karl arnold worked as a
psychologist's assistant, right?

223
00:12:00,211 --> 00:12:02,199
Yeah. which made it easy
for him to watch, target,

224
00:12:02,246 --> 00:12:04,046
And learn about the victims
from a distance.

225
00:12:04,084 --> 00:12:05,994
Yeah, it also made him
hard to find.

226
00:12:06,051 --> 00:12:07,796
Like the fox,
our man here found a way

227
00:12:07,824 --> 00:12:09,184
To hide in plain sight.

228
00:12:09,231 --> 00:12:11,367
But he's pulling from
2 completely different units.

229
00:12:11,434 --> 00:12:14,338
Williams a medic,
downey an army captain.

230
00:12:14,422 --> 00:12:16,694
Someone knew of that
military connection.

231
00:12:16,788 --> 00:12:19,598
Both families were attacked within a
month of the fathers being deployed.

232
00:12:19,654 --> 00:12:21,400
Gave them time to settle in,

233
00:12:21,429 --> 00:12:23,836
Get comfortable that
the fathers weren't there.

234
00:12:23,864 --> 00:12:26,193
And once inside the home,
the fox would live with the families

235
00:12:26,231 --> 00:12:27,508
And then become the father.

236
00:12:27,527 --> 00:12:29,106
But not this unsub.

237
00:12:29,191 --> 00:12:32,113
He just walked in
and dispensed with the family.

238
00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:34,219
Living with them wasn't
part of the fantasy.

239
00:12:34,284 --> 00:12:35,434
Hudson: agent rossi.

240
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:37,256
The picture you requested.

241
00:12:38,063 --> 00:12:40,250
Thanks to you, we pulled
some prints off it.

242
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:42,438
And all the prints
were on lucy.

243
00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:45,635
The bullet hit
the father dead center.

244
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:48,664
The prints match that
of the newport news killings.

245
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,036
It's the same killer.

246
00:12:50,073 --> 00:12:52,806
Family annihilators like the fox,
they start with one victim.

247
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,672
And once they feel capable,
they move on to a second victim.

248
00:12:55,729 --> 00:12:57,689
They don't start
with entire families.

249
00:12:57,736 --> 00:13:00,733
There are more victims.
we just haven't found them yet.

250
00:13:04,301 --> 00:13:06,170
Karl, it appears
you have a fan.

251
00:13:06,292 --> 00:13:07,259
Admirer.

252
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,656
Not a fan.

253
00:13:10,101 --> 00:13:11,610
Big difference.
right?

254
00:13:12,752 --> 00:13:16,301
Is this the first time you've been
contacted by your admirer?

255
00:13:21,696 --> 00:13:23,405
I have many fans.

256
00:13:24,648 --> 00:13:25,963
Even my own website.

257
00:13:26,648 --> 00:13:27,625
Don't you?

258
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,180
You'd be astounded

259
00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:37,420
At some of the questions
they ask.

260
00:13:37,672 --> 00:13:40,658
I make a log of all of them.
Would you like to read some?

261
00:13:40,747 --> 00:13:41,986
I would love to.

262
00:13:42,417 --> 00:13:43,544
You'd love to?

263
00:13:46,053 --> 00:13:46,730
Yes.

264
00:13:48,684 --> 00:13:49,463
Here.

265
00:13:50,444 --> 00:13:51,214
Look.

266
00:13:58,096 --> 00:13:59,267
Maybe later.

267
00:14:00,245 --> 00:14:02,602
Your admirer
is taking wedding rings,

268
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:03,757
Just like you.

269
00:14:04,498 --> 00:14:06,151
But maybe not
for the same reason.

270
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,029
Like how you took
all of mine.

271
00:14:29,701 --> 00:14:30,978
You took mine.

272
00:14:33,052 --> 00:14:34,282
But i see...

273
00:14:35,568 --> 00:14:36,967
you lost yours.

274
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:40,142
8 rings, 4 families.

275
00:14:40,226 --> 00:14:42,254
Or was it one ring
for each family?

276
00:14:42,358 --> 00:14:44,198
How'd you come
to lose your ring?

277
00:14:45,103 --> 00:14:46,446
wait, don't tell me.

278
00:14:46,517 --> 00:14:48,554
A casualty of the job.

279
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:50,734
My job is what
put you in here.

280
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,619
True.

281
00:14:53,909 --> 00:14:55,627
But then,
it's the children

282
00:14:56,701 --> 00:14:58,823
Who suffer most.
wouldn't you agree?

283
00:14:59,405 --> 00:15:01,480
You'd know more
about that than me.

284
00:15:02,043 --> 00:15:03,817
Which is why
you came to me.

285
00:15:08,104 --> 00:15:10,339
I can help you with that,
agent hotchner.

286
00:15:10,398 --> 00:15:11,929
I certainly can.

287
00:15:15,602 --> 00:15:17,640
But I'll need to see those photos.

288
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,366
May I?

289
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:26,341
A word?

290
00:15:26,945 --> 00:15:30,299
- Is there a problem, Emily?
- There's no problem, Karl.

291
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,955
We cannot show him these.

292
00:15:43,134 --> 00:15:46,608
These images will be his undoing
and our way in.

293
00:15:46,733 --> 00:15:50,567
- But they're not just images.
- That's exactly what they are.

294
00:15:50,692 --> 00:15:52,371
We can't use Lucy like that.

295
00:15:52,496 --> 00:15:54,718
It's a tradeoff we have to make.

296
00:15:56,124 --> 00:15:59,937
So, we are using
a dead 12-year-old girl

297
00:16:00,062 --> 00:16:03,125
in a bathing suit as
a bargaining chip for what?

298
00:16:04,441 --> 00:16:06,312
To him it's not just a photograph.

299
00:16:06,437 --> 00:16:09,342
It's much, much more,
and we need to know what.

300
00:16:10,964 --> 00:16:11,969
Look, I'm...

301
00:16:14,578 --> 00:16:16,435
I've never done this before.

302
00:16:17,364 --> 00:16:18,988
And you don't have to now.

303
00:16:23,845 --> 00:16:24,966
Yes, I do.

304
00:16:26,609 --> 00:16:27,797
All right.

305
00:16:28,201 --> 00:16:30,531
When I feel he's ready
to talk, I'll leave the room.

306
00:16:31,028 --> 00:16:32,483
You get him talking.

307
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:34,385
Whatever he does,

308
00:16:34,955 --> 00:16:36,536
whatever you feel,

309
00:16:36,749 --> 00:16:38,430
just stay on script.

310
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:41,281
We need to know why
he killed those families.

311
00:16:41,731 --> 00:16:43,773
He's had a smattering of visits,

312
00:16:43,898 --> 00:16:45,758
a couple of whack jobs contact him,

313
00:16:45,883 --> 00:16:47,900
but nothing as direct
as this admirer person.

314
00:16:48,025 --> 00:16:50,117
How are we doing on the prints
on the picture?

315
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:52,052
Oh. I'm still running them.

316
00:16:52,275 --> 00:16:53,655
How are you holding up?

317
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,848
Military families,
they always fear the worst.

318
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:59,269
They know their men
may not return, but this...

319
00:16:59,712 --> 00:17:01,586
to see a father lose so much.

320
00:17:01,711 --> 00:17:03,479
I wish I had something for you.

321
00:17:03,604 --> 00:17:07,390
I truly cannot find a damn thing
that connects these families.

322
00:17:07,515 --> 00:17:09,617
Geographically,
both of them are thousands

323
00:17:09,742 --> 00:17:11,343
of miles away from their family.

324
00:17:11,468 --> 00:17:14,790
Communication's all they had...
emails, phone calls, letters.

325
00:17:14,915 --> 00:17:16,572
But that's military communication.

326
00:17:16,697 --> 00:17:19,609
Even between families, it requires a
kind of juice I'm not allowed to use.

327
00:17:19,734 --> 00:17:22,040
Come on.
You hacked into the FBI database.

328
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,678
And they gave me a job.
And I like my job.

329
00:17:24,803 --> 00:17:26,002
And I like my life.

330
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:30,113
- All right, I'll make some inquiries.
- Ok. Do that. Take care. Bye.

331
00:17:30,389 --> 00:17:32,982
So Lucy dies last, alone.

332
00:17:33,107 --> 00:17:34,970
This by itself doesn't
really mean anything,

333
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,929
but when we look again
at the Williams file,

334
00:17:37,054 --> 00:17:39,171
we notice that the majority
of the foreign fingerprints

335
00:17:39,296 --> 00:17:41,067
came from Karen Williams' room,
which means

336
00:17:41,192 --> 00:17:43,508
the unsub spent most
of his time in there with Karen.

337
00:17:43,633 --> 00:17:46,626
Then he must have separated her
from the rest of the family.

338
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,983
Lucy Downey was already in the pool.

339
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,600
That much was done for the unsub.

340
00:17:51,725 --> 00:17:54,209
Then this unsub is driven by
some other kind of compulsion,

341
00:17:54,334 --> 00:17:55,454
some other need.

342
00:17:55,579 --> 00:17:57,567
Hotch was right.
This isn't a coincidence.

343
00:17:57,692 --> 00:17:59,353
It's a possible signature.

344
00:18:01,893 --> 00:18:04,312
Sir, I know that,
but two families have died.

345
00:18:04,997 --> 00:18:07,834
No, I realize this breaks
protocol, but...

346
00:18:09,571 --> 00:18:12,382
No, all we want is to stop
this from happening again.

347
00:18:13,964 --> 00:18:17,014
Sir, I promise you,
agent Garcia is the best we have.

348
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:18,175
Ok. Thank you.

349
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,038
We need to look at each
of the victims as a hub,

350
00:18:21,163 --> 00:18:24,000
with lives outside
of their own families.

351
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,904
Well, each one of them has their own
connections outside the family.

352
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:28,876
School, friends, tutors,
business colleagues.

353
00:18:29,001 --> 00:18:31,304
And each one of these people
are considered access points back

354
00:18:31,429 --> 00:18:33,266
- to the family.
- That could take weeks.

355
00:18:33,391 --> 00:18:36,144
Well, you have time. From remorse
to the desire to kill again

356
00:18:36,269 --> 00:18:38,158
the unsub will go through
a gamut of emotions.

357
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:41,182
It could be another year before the
unsub feels the desire to kill again.

358
00:18:41,307 --> 00:18:43,621
As horrific as these crimes are,
this city doesn't have

359
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,082
the resources to commit
that amount of time.

360
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,038
We have full access to all military
records for the fathers.

361
00:18:49,163 --> 00:18:51,253
Well, now at least we have access to

362
00:18:51,378 --> 00:18:53,682
the main hub between families.

363
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,326
The dads.

364
00:18:55,633 --> 00:18:57,969
All right, well, let's find out
what connects them.

365
00:18:59,618 --> 00:19:00,574
Stand up.

366
00:19:05,206 --> 00:19:06,774
You want to see, don't you?

367
00:19:07,025 --> 00:19:08,202
Very much.

368
00:19:08,753 --> 00:19:10,131
We're gonna show you.

369
00:19:32,831 --> 00:19:35,671
This is the home of the Downey family.
There were 3 children.

370
00:19:35,796 --> 00:19:37,231
How old are the children?

371
00:19:37,356 --> 00:19:40,267
- 12, 9, and 4. A girl and two boys.
- Where were they found?

372
00:19:41,415 --> 00:19:42,388
Over there.

373
00:19:45,904 --> 00:19:46,726
Buried.

374
00:19:47,445 --> 00:19:48,428
Interesting.

375
00:19:48,553 --> 00:19:51,607
Laura, the mother, and the two boys
were killed in the house.

376
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:53,775
The daughter?

377
00:20:05,144 --> 00:20:07,914
This is where the mother
and the youngest son were killed.

378
00:20:08,663 --> 00:20:10,920
The other boy was shot
in the bedroom closet.

379
00:20:11,602 --> 00:20:13,635
- Where's the father?
- Overseas.

380
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,725
The killer knows this.

381
00:20:16,419 --> 00:20:18,424
He knows everything
about this family,

382
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:21,469
and he watches their every move

383
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:24,430
to be sure he achieves
what he needs.

384
00:20:29,207 --> 00:20:31,764
You have no idea how he knows

385
00:20:31,889 --> 00:20:33,203
the father is gone

386
00:20:34,135 --> 00:20:36,497
or how he targets these families,
and the how.

387
00:20:37,467 --> 00:20:38,876
That's the key.

388
00:20:40,663 --> 00:20:41,698
The how...

389
00:20:42,645 --> 00:20:43,825
is why he...

390
00:20:44,686 --> 00:20:46,121
was able to catch me.

391
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:49,837
You watched the families for days.

392
00:20:50,766 --> 00:20:51,793
Weeks.

393
00:20:53,699 --> 00:20:55,093
I got to know them.

394
00:20:56,187 --> 00:20:57,297
But not your guy.

395
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,593
He doesn't need weeks.
If he did, he'd stay longer.

396
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:00,562
Why?

397
00:21:04,022 --> 00:21:05,593
So he can enjoy them.

398
00:21:08,645 --> 00:21:11,185
But what I don't understand...

399
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,806
Is why he didn't
separate the children.

400
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,301
Exactly.

401
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:19,249
That way you have more control.
No room for error.

402
00:21:19,461 --> 00:21:22,173
Why he didn't put the boys
in separate rooms and say,

403
00:21:23,329 --> 00:21:27,310
- if you cry...
- I'll have to kill mommy.

404
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,337
Tell me...

405
00:21:35,701 --> 00:21:37,198
How did the girl die?

406
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:39,660
She was drowned.

407
00:21:41,547 --> 00:21:43,068
Yet the others were shot.

408
00:21:56,763 --> 00:21:57,967
May I see her?

409
00:22:00,387 --> 00:22:02,070
What's so special about the girl?

410
00:22:05,025 --> 00:22:06,296
To suffocate her.

411
00:22:08,075 --> 00:22:10,164
To feel the life leave her body

412
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:12,867
means everything
to the man who did this.

413
00:22:14,028 --> 00:22:16,793
To you, maybe, but not to this killer.
Not in the same way.

414
00:22:19,835 --> 00:22:22,634
All I did was show them how weak

415
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:24,253
fathers could be.
That's all.

416
00:22:24,378 --> 00:22:27,341
Every child you killed
you abused physically.

417
00:22:27,885 --> 00:22:30,390
For this man, there is
no sexual gratification.

418
00:22:33,082 --> 00:22:36,092
At least I spared the fathers
the grief of living.

419
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:47,928
Please...

420
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:50,785
Please don't do this.

421
00:22:52,423 --> 00:22:54,500
Come on. Let's get you cleaned up.

422
00:22:56,447 --> 00:22:59,217
Dani! Didn't I tell you
to always lock the door!

423
00:22:59,342 --> 00:23:00,920
Nick, cleats off!

424
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,711
Dani!
Where are you?

425
00:23:08,023 --> 00:23:09,040
Dani?

426
00:23:11,069 --> 00:23:11,931
Mom?

427
00:23:15,326 --> 00:23:16,742
Please don't...

428
00:23:17,098 --> 00:23:18,062
Please...

429
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,623
Mom...

430
00:24:37,967 --> 00:24:39,942
The girl was suffocated,
not shot, right?

431
00:24:40,067 --> 00:24:40,881
Yes.

432
00:24:44,397 --> 00:24:45,821
Just like the other two.

433
00:24:45,996 --> 00:24:47,955
Her name is Dani.
She's 14.

434
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,103
And the father?

435
00:24:49,255 --> 00:24:50,497
Afghanistan.

436
00:24:51,466 --> 00:24:53,116
Does this rule out remorse?

437
00:24:53,888 --> 00:24:55,295
Yes, it does.

438
00:24:55,666 --> 00:24:57,140
So what is it now?

439
00:24:59,191 --> 00:25:02,566
The escalation between kills
indicates a major psychological break.

440
00:25:02,691 --> 00:25:03,859
How is it escalated?

441
00:25:03,984 --> 00:25:07,059
The timeframe between kills
has gone from a year to just 3 days.

442
00:25:07,184 --> 00:25:10,258
For the unsub, something
has dramatically changed.

443
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:12,835
Some kind of major external
stressor forced this unsub

444
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,096
into feeling the need to kill again
without any remorse.

445
00:25:15,221 --> 00:25:17,569
Mirror neurons and stressors
relating to the unsub's past

446
00:25:17,694 --> 00:25:20,175
may have triggered this,
the strongest of which is smell.

447
00:25:23,317 --> 00:25:24,613
That sound.

448
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,652
The Williams were killed a year ago.

449
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:33,337
Were there any military maneuvers
going on at langley at that time?

450
00:25:33,462 --> 00:25:36,290
The annual air show,
but nothing as big as this.

451
00:25:36,582 --> 00:25:38,286
He's killed again, hasn't he?

452
00:25:39,818 --> 00:25:41,017
Luckily for me.

453
00:25:42,158 --> 00:25:43,126
Luckily?

454
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:45,762
Now we're alone.

455
00:25:48,829 --> 00:25:51,413
You stated that the families don't
know the killer. Why?

456
00:25:52,111 --> 00:25:54,235
Now we wait, right?
You and I,

457
00:25:55,162 --> 00:25:58,231
see if my...
admirer contacts me.

458
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:00,761
He will.

459
00:26:03,944 --> 00:26:06,097
Yours was one of the first
cases I studied.

460
00:26:06,222 --> 00:26:07,052
Really?

461
00:26:09,453 --> 00:26:11,525
I've been fascinated ever since.

462
00:26:14,816 --> 00:26:15,785
With what?

463
00:26:16,997 --> 00:26:17,845
You.

464
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:27,696
And now...

465
00:26:28,998 --> 00:26:31,224
you want to know what I did...

466
00:26:32,545 --> 00:26:33,754
to the children.

467
00:26:35,076 --> 00:26:36,179
Don't you?

468
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:38,860
Yes.

469
00:26:40,741 --> 00:26:41,905
I can show you.

470
00:26:45,682 --> 00:26:48,441
I can show you exactly
what I did to them.

471
00:26:50,128 --> 00:26:51,150
Tell me.

472
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:02,405
Children are so precious.

473
00:27:04,534 --> 00:27:05,818
So clean.

474
00:27:08,402 --> 00:27:11,295
But they need guidance.
Especially the girls.

475
00:27:12,711 --> 00:27:13,637
Why?

476
00:27:13,872 --> 00:27:16,556
Girls have much more to lose...

477
00:27:18,111 --> 00:27:19,154
than boys.

478
00:27:21,145 --> 00:27:24,678
It's a fact the female body
can handle pain much better.

479
00:27:26,199 --> 00:27:27,795
What did you do to them?

480
00:27:28,745 --> 00:27:30,104
I showed them

481
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,133
what men...

482
00:27:33,611 --> 00:27:36,270
Their fathers and brothers...

483
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,374
are capable of.

484
00:27:41,217 --> 00:27:42,368
And what is that?

485
00:27:43,093 --> 00:27:44,675
You sure you want to know?

486
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:45,829
Yes.

487
00:27:46,476 --> 00:27:48,573
Morgan, if the Langley
air show is the stressor,

488
00:27:48,698 --> 00:27:50,671
then karl's admirer
doesn't fit the profile.

489
00:27:50,796 --> 00:27:52,818
A psychopath suffering
a major psychological break

490
00:27:52,943 --> 00:27:54,277
doesn't brag about it, Hotch.

491
00:27:54,402 --> 00:27:57,427
There was nothing you could have done
that would have saved that family today.

492
00:27:57,552 --> 00:27:59,517
Well, that's if I'm right
about the profile.

493
00:27:59,642 --> 00:28:01,095
I think you are.

494
00:28:01,626 --> 00:28:04,390
Karl's admirer doesn't have anything
to do with these killings.

495
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:06,616
Well, either way,
we need to know who is.

496
00:28:06,741 --> 00:28:08,663
Hotch, I want you to stay
with him and find out

497
00:28:08,788 --> 00:28:10,338
so we can stop this son of a bitch.

498
00:28:10,463 --> 00:28:11,647
I plan to.

499
00:28:12,664 --> 00:28:14,483
Once I killed the children,

500
00:28:15,142 --> 00:28:16,840
it always amazed me

501
00:28:17,581 --> 00:28:18,660
how little...

502
00:28:20,095 --> 00:28:22,108
The father fought the inevitable.

503
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:24,471
Which was what?

504
00:28:25,193 --> 00:28:26,032
Dying.

505
00:28:27,303 --> 00:28:29,285
I'm trolling through
the williams' emails,

506
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,876
satellite phone calls,
land line phone calls,

507
00:28:32,295 --> 00:28:35,171
family photos, their life,

508
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:37,131
- all of it.
- What about the Downeys?

509
00:28:37,256 --> 00:28:39,419
They're up next,
and there's a ton to go through.

510
00:28:39,544 --> 00:28:41,256
- Fingerprints, Garcia?
- Zip.

511
00:28:41,596 --> 00:28:44,055
They're... there's nothing here.
I'm sorry, folks.

512
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,969
Garcia, widen the search.

513
00:28:46,094 --> 00:28:48,379
Morgan, I already did.
Vicap combines every database

514
00:28:48,504 --> 00:28:50,311
in this country.
We're as wide as we can go.

515
00:28:50,436 --> 00:28:53,183
Abuse can have a long-term
effect on any child's brain,

516
00:28:53,308 --> 00:28:55,935
but for the abused child
who has the high-risk gene

517
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,818
and the orbital cortex damage,

518
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,626
the combination is devastating.

519
00:28:59,916 --> 00:29:01,517
All right, this air show
is military.

520
00:29:01,642 --> 00:29:04,127
These fathers are all soldiers
fighting a war on foreign soil.

521
00:29:04,252 --> 00:29:06,402
We know that none of these
graves are a sign of remorse.

522
00:29:06,527 --> 00:29:09,264
Hey, guys. Look at these graves.
What are they reminiscent of?

523
00:29:09,389 --> 00:29:11,049
- Mass graves.
- Exactly.

524
00:29:11,174 --> 00:29:12,890
Wich would indicate
the unsub experienced

525
00:29:13,015 --> 00:29:15,260
early pubescent 3-dimentional
mirror neurons reflecting

526
00:29:15,385 --> 00:29:17,162
events similar
to the one they're creating.

527
00:29:17,287 --> 00:29:19,037
I think this unsub
was born into conflict.

528
00:29:19,162 --> 00:29:20,883
But where was he born into conflict?

529
00:29:21,008 --> 00:29:23,695
When was the last time we saw
anything like mass graves in the U.S.?

530
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,222
- We haven't. Not in our lifetimes.
- Not within our borders.

531
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,259
Vicap is national,
not international.

532
00:29:28,384 --> 00:29:30,208
Garcia, international databases?

533
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:32,455
Interpol is the biggest.
If they did it, they're in it.

534
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,459
It's pretty obvious
that he's done this before,

535
00:29:34,584 --> 00:29:36,090
but the question is where and why.

536
00:29:36,215 --> 00:29:38,609
Karl, I never thought
that you'd be this honest.

537
00:29:39,833 --> 00:29:41,160
It takes a good woman

538
00:29:41,688 --> 00:29:43,030
to make an honest man.

539
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:45,158
And anyway, let's face it...

540
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,551
she's prettier than you.

541
00:29:46,676 --> 00:29:49,318
Karl, do you know why
you killed all those families?

542
00:29:49,443 --> 00:29:51,562
I've already told you why.

543
00:29:51,924 --> 00:29:54,697
No, you told me how, not why.

544
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:56,959
And the reasons why, in this case,

545
00:29:57,084 --> 00:29:59,056
are very different
than they were for you.

546
00:29:59,181 --> 00:30:01,083
They're very, very different.

547
00:30:01,409 --> 00:30:04,176
And as you so eloquently have
been pointing out to agent Prentiss,

548
00:30:04,301 --> 00:30:06,646
all of your motivations
were about sex.

549
00:30:09,636 --> 00:30:11,782
Motivations you learned
from your father.

550
00:30:21,841 --> 00:30:23,142
You really have

551
00:30:24,141 --> 00:30:26,208
done your research on me,

552
00:30:26,333 --> 00:30:27,251
Emily.

553
00:30:28,489 --> 00:30:29,530
I'm flattered.

554
00:30:30,103 --> 00:30:31,957
You're also filled
with feelings

555
00:30:32,454 --> 00:30:34,293
Of extreme self-hatred.

556
00:30:34,413 --> 00:30:35,876
It must be distracting

557
00:30:35,996 --> 00:30:37,651
Working with someone
so beautiful.

558
00:30:38,257 --> 00:30:41,438
You forced those men
to watch their children die,

559
00:30:42,087 --> 00:30:43,790
And here's why, karl.

560
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:46,157
Here's why
you are what you are.

561
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:48,004
What i would
do to you.

562
00:30:48,124 --> 00:30:50,190
By killing
the fathers last,

563
00:30:50,627 --> 00:30:52,527
You were killing
your own father,

564
00:30:52,859 --> 00:30:54,533
And ultimately yourself,

565
00:30:55,045 --> 00:30:56,929
Over and over again.

566
00:31:12,171 --> 00:31:13,890
This isn't over,
agent hotchner.

567
00:31:14,568 --> 00:31:15,910
Least not for you.

568
00:31:19,332 --> 00:31:20,373
Wait, hotch.

569
00:31:22,529 --> 00:31:25,227
For karl, it's all about
the fathers.

570
00:31:25,649 --> 00:31:27,925
In this case,
it's all about the girls.

571
00:31:28,784 --> 00:31:30,183
They die last.

572
00:31:30,729 --> 00:31:33,246
They're laid out last.
none of them are shot.

573
00:31:33,699 --> 00:31:35,945
None of them show any signs
of sexual motive.

574
00:31:36,065 --> 00:31:40,106
What if we applied that logic
to these killings?

575
00:31:40,226 --> 00:31:41,977
That's something
we hadn't considered.

576
00:31:42,097 --> 00:31:44,113
Why would we? it's so rare.
- What is?

577
00:31:44,233 --> 00:31:46,344
- The killer's a woman.
- A woman?

578
00:31:46,464 --> 00:31:47,911
i'll let morgan know.

579
00:31:51,499 --> 00:31:54,273
Karl, just now you said that this
wasn't over for me.

580
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:56,233
What did you mean by that?

581
00:31:59,414 --> 00:32:00,846
He's just getting warmed up.

582
00:32:02,037 --> 00:32:02,984
It's just...

583
00:32:04,292 --> 00:32:05,980
You don't see it.

584
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:09,236
But you will.

585
00:32:10,744 --> 00:32:12,629
All right, we'll
work it in right now.

586
00:32:13,067 --> 00:32:15,067
Prentiss thinks the unsub might be
a woman.

587
00:32:15,114 --> 00:32:17,359
That's why we couldn't
Find a sexual motive.

588
00:32:17,452 --> 00:32:19,608
Wherever she's from, her father's
a military man.

589
00:32:19,728 --> 00:32:21,551
Derek, i've got a hit.
interpol.

590
00:32:21,617 --> 00:32:24,282
2 hits. 3 hits. 3 crime scenes.
3 different cities.

591
00:32:24,402 --> 00:32:26,106
The first--zagreb, 1998.

592
00:32:26,226 --> 00:32:28,350
A woman and her 8-month-old
baby are both killed.

593
00:32:28,417 --> 00:32:30,350
And then 2 years later,

594
00:32:30,417 --> 00:32:32,679
The same prints show up
in modena, italy,

595
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:35,484
Then 2007, london, england,
young couple, both shot.

596
00:32:35,874 --> 00:32:37,865
You were right.
she's killed before.

597
00:32:37,985 --> 00:32:39,721
Zagreb is the capital
city of croatia.

598
00:32:39,786 --> 00:32:40,868
Is that significant?

599
00:32:40,887 --> 00:32:43,653
Between 1991 and '95 they fought
A bitter battle for independence.

600
00:32:43,773 --> 00:32:45,733
Serbian forces
tried to ethnically cleanse

601
00:32:45,853 --> 00:32:47,618
Over 40,000 bosnian
muslims.

602
00:32:47,738 --> 00:32:50,348
Then at some point within the
last 2 years,she moved to america.

603
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,504
- She's on the run.
- and ran right into a city

604
00:32:52,624 --> 00:32:54,103
Filled with
military families.

605
00:32:54,223 --> 00:32:56,751
The only mass graves reminiscent
of the ones the unsubs created

606
00:32:56,817 --> 00:32:58,851
Were found all over bosnia
after the war,

607
00:32:58,918 --> 00:33:01,183
But none of them rival
that of srebrenica.

608
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:03,676
Dutch u.n. forces created a safe
haven for refugees.

609
00:33:03,796 --> 00:33:06,384
Then in 1995, bosnian serb forces
surrounded the town.

610
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:09,050
A psychopath born in the middle
of that conflict--

611
00:33:09,117 --> 00:33:10,325
That's not a good mix.

612
00:33:10,445 --> 00:33:12,729
She's exacting her life experiences
onto the victims.

613
00:33:12,869 --> 00:33:14,437
You think this woman
was there?

614
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:16,733
Well, think about it. langley's
filling up with civilians

615
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,710
And military vehicles
just like srebrenica.

616
00:33:18,728 --> 00:33:20,024
Can you determine
her age?

617
00:33:20,101 --> 00:33:22,859
Based on victimology, Each of
these girls is no older than 15.

618
00:33:22,979 --> 00:33:25,531
The balkan war lasted
between '93 and '95,

619
00:33:25,651 --> 00:33:28,633
So if the girls represent the unsub,
She's somewherein her late 20s.

620
00:33:28,753 --> 00:33:30,247
How did srebrenica end?

621
00:33:30,367 --> 00:33:31,984
It was a massacre.

622
00:34:04,151 --> 00:34:06,891
I don't think this woman
has anything to do with karl.

623
00:34:06,971 --> 00:34:08,293
I encouraged him.

624
00:34:10,468 --> 00:34:11,886
I flirted with him.

625
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:15,344
Made it personal.

626
00:34:16,482 --> 00:34:18,743
Getting intimate
with a killer is...

627
00:34:19,979 --> 00:34:21,281
So different.

628
00:34:21,758 --> 00:34:23,046
It's what we do.

629
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:26,990
Yeah. but...

630
00:34:28,883 --> 00:34:31,614
There's no fixing how i feel
right now, is there?

631
00:34:33,878 --> 00:34:35,456
But it helped the case.

632
00:34:36,486 --> 00:34:38,317
And you did
what you had to.

633
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:39,875
Agent hotchner.

634
00:34:40,556 --> 00:34:41,550
Before you go,

635
00:34:41,595 --> 00:34:43,918
There's one final thing
i'd like to share with you.

636
00:34:46,223 --> 00:34:48,150
Let's just get this over with.

637
00:34:49,133 --> 00:34:52,297
This unsub is armed and suffering
A major psychological break,

638
00:34:52,321 --> 00:34:54,143
And she will not hesitate to kill again.

639
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:55,823
She's white and in her 20s.

640
00:34:55,857 --> 00:34:58,104
We believe she came to
the u.s. a few years ago.

641
00:34:58,224 --> 00:35:00,425
She's likely on foot.She could be
eastern european.

642
00:35:00,545 --> 00:35:02,306
She may speak
little to no english.

643
00:35:02,381 --> 00:35:05,083
Now, if you manage to apprehend or
corner her, Do not underestimate

644
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:07,147
this woman.She will try
to fight her way out.

645
00:35:07,267 --> 00:35:09,801
The downeys live less than
a mile from the foresters,

646
00:35:09,921 --> 00:35:11,932
Which means she's
somewhere in this area.

647
00:35:12,046 --> 00:35:13,207
I see something.

648
00:35:15,438 --> 00:35:16,207
Wait.

649
00:35:17,518 --> 00:35:19,267
Wait a minute.
could it be?

650
00:35:22,403 --> 00:35:24,197
They're all connected
to the same site.

651
00:35:24,317 --> 00:35:26,144
Every media outlet
is being informed

652
00:35:26,172 --> 00:35:28,050
Of the clear and present danger
to the public.

653
00:35:28,204 --> 00:35:29,549
Thank you very much.

654
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,796
Ok, guys,
i really have got something.

655
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:33,698
All of these photos,
every one of them,

656
00:35:33,818 --> 00:35:36,213
Was uploaded to a user website
called photobug.

657
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:37,148
Photobug?

658
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:40,250
Yeah. members can upload
photos, videos, email,

659
00:35:40,317 --> 00:35:42,384
Webcam, chats.
i use it all the time.

660
00:35:42,451 --> 00:35:46,557
Every one of these families extensively
used this site For months, even years.

661
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:49,184
All these family photos
were printed by photobug.

662
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:51,623
Isn't it protected?
- Not from the people who run it.

663
00:35:51,743 --> 00:35:53,917
It's a great way for military
families to keep in touch.

664
00:35:53,954 --> 00:35:56,356
And a perfect way to target a family
Without anybody's knowledge.

665
00:35:56,385 --> 00:35:58,420
They outsource work to people all
over the country.

666
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:01,130
So i took your profile, Hacked
into their employee database,

667
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:03,017
Came up with this list
of potentials,

668
00:36:03,084 --> 00:36:05,582
One of which is a match
that screams homicidal bitch.

669
00:36:05,702 --> 00:36:07,828
Her name's miranda dracar,
she was an orphan,

670
00:36:07,948 --> 00:36:10,391
Born in sarajevo
during 1982.

671
00:36:10,677 --> 00:36:12,950
She was adopted by a family
in srebrenica.

672
00:36:13,017 --> 00:36:13,904
Let's go.

673
00:36:24,743 --> 00:36:25,723
The foresters.

674
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,150
Morgan.

675
00:36:30,217 --> 00:36:31,662
The unsub's next victim.

676
00:36:31,782 --> 00:36:33,081
He's a marine.

677
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:38,336
Usmc, first battalion,
engineer.

678
00:36:38,745 --> 00:36:40,753
Jennifer,
call your contact.

679
00:36:43,339 --> 00:36:45,615
Sir, i'm gonna need access
to every piece of data

680
00:36:45,735 --> 00:36:48,120
On u.s. marine sergeant young.
it may save his family.

681
00:36:48,209 --> 00:36:50,842
Why are you always so slow?
we're late. come on.

682
00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:52,280
I am, i am.

683
00:37:06,631 --> 00:37:09,134
So you think you found
my admirer.

684
00:37:09,992 --> 00:37:10,851
A woman.

685
00:37:10,911 --> 00:37:12,589
No. we found the killer.

686
00:37:12,977 --> 00:37:14,744
With my help, of course.

687
00:37:15,144 --> 00:37:16,693
Your admirer

688
00:37:16,956 --> 00:37:20,506
is exactly like
everyone who contacts you--lost.

689
00:37:20,757 --> 00:37:23,516
My love, your guy
is far from lost.

690
00:37:23,953 --> 00:37:24,857
We're done.

691
00:37:24,977 --> 00:37:25,958
So is he.

692
00:37:28,766 --> 00:37:30,937
"look at what
i have done."

693
00:37:32,405 --> 00:37:33,950
It's quite brilliant,
you know?

694
00:37:34,017 --> 00:37:36,017
We will find
whoever sent you that.

695
00:37:36,084 --> 00:37:37,503
No, agent hotchner,

696
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,288
I rather think

697
00:37:40,246 --> 00:37:41,754
He's already found you.

698
00:38:34,685 --> 00:38:35,599
Morgan?

699
00:38:36,011 --> 00:38:37,150
I'm all right.

700
00:38:37,473 --> 00:38:38,498
I'm all right.

701
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:54,219
I can't believe you can't see
what he's doing.

702
00:38:54,871 --> 00:38:56,249
What is going on?

703
