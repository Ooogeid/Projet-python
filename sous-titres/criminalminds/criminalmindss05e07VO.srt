1
00:01:24,629 --> 00:01:27,653
Best show ever, Dante!
Great show!

2
00:01:27,706 --> 00:01:30,214
Nice job!
Beautiful.

3
00:01:30,248 --> 00:01:31,542
Just let me...

4
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,871
Hey, look, you're not
allowed to be over there, all right?

5
00:01:33,908 --> 00:01:34,932
Stay there.

6
00:01:37,106 --> 00:01:38,524
Here he comes.

7
00:01:45,669 --> 00:01:48,589
I know. I know.
I know.

8
00:02:49,797 --> 00:02:52,220
He looked right at me.
Did you see that?

9
00:02:52,236 --> 00:02:53,875
I saw it. I saw him
look right at you.

10
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,082
- We had a connection.
- *******

11
00:02:56,118 --> 00:02:57,405
When he sang "resurrection"

12
00:02:57,452 --> 00:03:00,218
it was like everyone
in the theater just disappeared.

13
00:03:00,274 --> 00:03:01,439
He is so beautiful.

14
00:03:01,495 --> 00:03:02,922
- So beautiful.
- Totally, man.

15
00:03:02,987 --> 00:03:04,054
So beautiful.

16
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,050
This is us.

17
00:03:05,238 --> 00:03:06,221
Both of you?

18
00:03:06,287 --> 00:03:07,092
Yeah.

19
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:10,100
We live on the same block, dummy.

20
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,739
I could, uh, walk you
to your building.

21
00:03:12,814 --> 00:03:13,631
What?

22
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:15,632
I mean, it's... it's dark.

23
00:03:15,688 --> 00:03:16,491
So?

24
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,162
We gotta go.

25
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:20,169
I'm just saying, it's dark.
I could walk you...

26
00:03:20,206 --> 00:03:23,793
I'm pretty sure
I'm tougher than you are, Ted.

27
00:03:28,098 --> 00:03:30,296
Thank you for taking us
to the concert, though, Ted.

28
00:03:30,353 --> 00:03:32,187
- Yeah.
- Bye!

29
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,527
Bye-bye.

30
00:03:33,574 --> 00:03:36,147
It's Ed, not Ted.

31
00:04:23,386 --> 00:04:25,545
The latest victim
is Tara Farris, 20.

32
00:04:25,601 --> 00:04:27,631
She's the third victim in 2 weeks.

33
00:04:27,678 --> 00:04:30,138
All found on freeway
off-ramps by commuters.

34
00:04:30,165 --> 00:04:31,565
Well, he's not hiding them.

35
00:04:31,602 --> 00:04:33,604
An l.A. Freeway
during morning rush hour?

36
00:04:33,651 --> 00:04:35,054
He wants them found.

37
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,954
Quickly.

38
00:04:36,308 --> 00:04:37,840
Well, they're still dressed.

39
00:04:37,887 --> 00:04:39,541
That minimizes the shock value.

40
00:04:39,596 --> 00:04:42,347
Maybe he's concerned for them.
Think he wants them taken care of?

41
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,054
No signs of sexual assault
on any of the victims.

42
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,577
Look how pale she is.

43
00:04:46,634 --> 00:04:48,822
All of them were severely
hypovolemic.

44
00:04:48,869 --> 00:04:51,120
Tara had less than a pint
of blood in her.

45
00:04:51,187 --> 00:04:53,454
Look at this. The first 2 had
more than 3 pints each.

46
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,054
If exsanguination is the goal,

47
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,120
the unsub is definitely
becoming more proficient.

48
00:04:57,187 --> 00:05:00,253
This is new. Tara's the only victim
to have a written message.

49
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,287
"The liar."

50
00:05:01,446 --> 00:05:02,460
"The" liar.

51
00:05:02,516 --> 00:05:03,898
That's strange, isn't it?

52
00:05:03,931 --> 00:05:06,556
Not a liar or just liar.

53
00:05:07,185 --> 00:05:09,014
So what did you lie about, Tara?

54
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,587
All of the victims appear
to have been strangled

55
00:05:11,654 --> 00:05:14,616
and then bled out through
identical wounds in the throat.

56
00:05:14,644 --> 00:05:18,339
Wait seriously, are those supposed
to be fang marks?

57
00:05:18,414 --> 00:05:21,263
All of the wounds on the victims
were covered in saliva.

58
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,054
Human saliva, as though...

59
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,104
Someone drank their blood.

60
00:05:34,650 --> 00:06:05,663
Team Criminal Minds
http://experts.heberg-forum.net/

61
00:06:06,885 --> 00:06:10,143
In the darkest pages
of the malign supernatural,

62
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,821
there is no more terrible
tradition than that of the vampire.

63
00:06:13,887 --> 00:06:16,506
A pariah even among demons.

64
00:06:16,619 --> 00:06:18,520
Writer montague summers.

65
00:06:18,853 --> 00:06:19,787
Ok. Thanks.

66
00:06:19,854 --> 00:06:22,294
So they've already set up
a task force in Los Angeles.

67
00:06:22,388 --> 00:06:24,155
This isn't their first serial case.

68
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,911
You remember detective owen kim?

69
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,154
From the stalker case.

70
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:29,924
You remember that case,
don't you, Spence?

71
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:31,801
I do remember that case.

72
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:34,374
Yeah, you ever talk to,
Lila anymore?

73
00:06:34,499 --> 00:06:36,930
You know, I think we should
probably focus on this case right now.

74
00:06:36,953 --> 00:06:38,361
It's a little more pertinent.

75
00:06:40,062 --> 00:06:42,083
All right, so tell us about
blood-drinkers, reid.

76
00:06:42,158 --> 00:06:44,090
Human blood consumption,
or clinical vampirism,

77
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,064
is known as renfield's syndrome,

78
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:49,935
named after the insect-eating character
in bram stoker's novel "dracula."

79
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:51,219
Are they sadists?

80
00:06:51,266 --> 00:06:54,167
Not necessarily. Pain to the victim
is usually only a byproduct.

81
00:06:54,223 --> 00:06:55,884
Blood is the focus.

82
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,827
Renfield's syndrome is usually
accompanied by

83
00:06:57,883 --> 00:06:59,319
varying levels of schizophrenia

84
00:06:59,356 --> 00:07:01,407
and occasionally
more classic cannibalism

85
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:02,753
if the condition evolves.

86
00:07:02,781 --> 00:07:04,361
Classic cannibalism.

87
00:07:04,408 --> 00:07:05,729
Lovely job we have.

88
00:07:05,766 --> 00:07:06,787
I will say this...

89
00:07:06,854 --> 00:07:09,017
true cases are exceedingly rare.

90
00:07:09,092 --> 00:07:11,236
That's comforting.
Sort of.

91
00:07:11,377 --> 00:07:13,947
Renfield's may be rare,
but vampires are anything but.

92
00:07:13,988 --> 00:07:16,105
And there's a huge
subculture in Los Angeles

93
00:07:16,171 --> 00:07:17,799
Of the red-drinking undead.

94
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:19,932
Why is that not a surprise?

95
00:07:21,429 --> 00:07:23,401
Garcia, all these people
drink blood?

96
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:26,062
Au contraire. They mostly just dress up
like Prentiss did in high school

97
00:07:26,091 --> 00:07:28,138
and they make believe.
It's all kinds of delicious.

98
00:07:28,175 --> 00:07:30,202
It's not the same thing
at all. As a matter of fact,

99
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,220
we should refer to this unsub
as a vampirist, not a vampire.

100
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:35,259
And they would be attracted
to the subculture

101
00:07:35,297 --> 00:07:37,466
merely for its professed
worship of blood.

102
00:07:37,522 --> 00:07:40,320
Ok, I'm going to continue spelunking
through the various online sites,

103
00:07:40,387 --> 00:07:42,596
see if anything jumps up
and bites me.

104
00:07:42,783 --> 00:07:43,853
Thanks, baby g...

105
00:07:44,772 --> 00:07:46,556
Thanks, Penelope.
Stay close.

106
00:07:47,232 --> 00:07:49,101
Yes, sir.
Garcia out.

107
00:07:49,138 --> 00:07:51,654
You guys, one more thing...
vampirists are coveters.

108
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,057
They most generally always
have some sort of relationship

109
00:07:54,142 --> 00:07:56,009
with the victim,
even if it's tangential.

110
00:07:56,065 --> 00:07:57,962
And they're likely
to become obsessed.

111
00:07:58,028 --> 00:08:00,779
They've almost certainly
crossed paths in some way.

112
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,166
It's ok. It's just me.
It's ray.

113
00:08:41,222 --> 00:08:42,724
You still in bed?

114
00:08:42,978 --> 00:08:43,982
I'm sick.

115
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:46,451
Look, Dante, you're already late.

116
00:08:46,647 --> 00:08:47,811
Don't call me that.

117
00:08:47,858 --> 00:08:50,272
Sorry, but, man,
you gotta get going, ok?

118
00:08:50,845 --> 00:08:51,912
I said no.

119
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,150
The record company is gonna
be pissed again if you're not.

120
00:08:55,215 --> 00:08:56,159
Get out!

121
00:08:57,023 --> 00:08:58,750
I know you hate these parties,

122
00:08:58,797 --> 00:09:00,526
but you've got to sell the record.

123
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,362
You can't blow this off.

124
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:03,718
It's your job, man.

125
00:09:03,756 --> 00:09:06,154
And it's my job to make you go.

126
00:09:08,825 --> 00:09:10,323
Do I have to be him?

127
00:09:10,586 --> 00:09:12,337
You know that you do.

128
00:09:13,646 --> 00:09:15,373
I'll be down in 20 minutes.

129
00:09:15,485 --> 00:09:18,063
Great. I'll make you
something to eat.

130
00:09:19,165 --> 00:09:20,358
I'm not hungry.

131
00:09:24,832 --> 00:09:26,306
What happened to you last night?

132
00:09:26,343 --> 00:09:27,348
What do you mean?

133
00:09:27,376 --> 00:09:29,999
After the show.
You just kind of disappeared.

134
00:09:30,196 --> 00:09:31,788
I don't remember.

135
00:09:42,654 --> 00:09:44,859
Hi, lieutenant Kim.
Agent Jareau.

136
00:09:44,934 --> 00:09:47,499
JJ, of course.
I remember most of you.

137
00:09:47,828 --> 00:09:49,224
Agent Hotchner.

138
00:09:49,403 --> 00:09:50,242
Reid.

139
00:09:50,986 --> 00:09:51,811
Morgan.

140
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,446
Welcome back to the left coast.

141
00:09:53,484 --> 00:09:55,935
These are agents Prentiss and Rossi.
I believe they're new to you.

142
00:09:55,982 --> 00:09:57,487
Hi. Pleasure.

143
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:59,805
We already have
a room set up full of

144
00:09:59,852 --> 00:10:02,742
glass boards, case files,
and extremely bad coffee.

145
00:10:02,883 --> 00:10:04,990
We've worked with a lot less.

146
00:10:05,094 --> 00:10:07,811
Agent Morgan's in charge now.
It's his show.

147
00:10:09,478 --> 00:10:10,586
Long story.

148
00:10:13,161 --> 00:10:15,471
I know you like to start
with the freshest information

149
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,743
and work your way back.

150
00:10:16,818 --> 00:10:18,993
So Tara's apartment has been
processed and sealed

151
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,461
in case you want to go there.

152
00:10:20,518 --> 00:10:22,525
And her body, along with
that of the first 2 girls,

153
00:10:22,553 --> 00:10:25,031
is at the morgue with an M.E.
Waiting there for your call.

154
00:10:25,078 --> 00:10:26,036
All right.

155
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:28,825
JJ, get set up here,
and then hook up with Garcia.

156
00:10:28,891 --> 00:10:30,361
Send her the witness information

157
00:10:30,418 --> 00:10:32,974
so she can start cross-referencing
with the first 2 victims.

158
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:35,048
Reid, I want you to go
through all the case files,

159
00:10:35,104 --> 00:10:36,706
set up a preliminary
profile based on

160
00:10:36,744 --> 00:10:39,253
what you already know about the
psychopathology. And the rest of us,

161
00:10:39,309 --> 00:10:41,375
let's find out what we can on Tara.

162
00:11:43,823 --> 00:11:46,930
So we're looking for a connection
between the witnesses.

163
00:11:46,954 --> 00:11:48,540
When vampirists become obsessed,

164
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:50,367
they aren't likely to find
a random victim.

165
00:11:50,433 --> 00:11:52,215
If we can find a cross-relationship,

166
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,184
someone in all the victims' lives,
that'll be incredibly helpful.

167
00:11:55,259 --> 00:11:57,004
Gina king knew Tara the longest.

168
00:11:57,023 --> 00:11:58,767
They apparently had
some classes together.

169
00:11:58,775 --> 00:12:00,977
Let's get all the information
we can on that relationship.

170
00:12:00,989 --> 00:12:03,647
As a matter of fact, get me everything
you can on all of Tara's friends.

171
00:12:03,669 --> 00:12:06,429
All right. In the morning I'll track
them down and do some follow-up.

172
00:12:06,461 --> 00:12:07,708
That's fine.

173
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:16,641
Dante.

174
00:12:17,068 --> 00:12:19,764
This is Jeff
from "metal life" magazine.

175
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:22,291
He's writing a story
on artists who cross over...

176
00:12:22,316 --> 00:12:23,398
Cross over.

177
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:26,703
Is that what I do,
Jeff from "metal life"?

178
00:12:27,486 --> 00:12:29,999
I guess, kind of.
You're not totally goth, right?

179
00:12:30,065 --> 00:12:31,849
That whole vampire thing
you do is...

180
00:12:31,868 --> 00:12:33,464
Ah, the vampire thing?

181
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,378
Yeah, your act.
****

182
00:12:36,747 --> 00:12:38,719
it appeals to certain people.

183
00:12:38,747 --> 00:12:41,921
It appeals to desperate,
sad people with, at best,

184
00:12:41,976 --> 00:12:44,396
a tenuous hold on reality.

185
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,952
Can I quote you on that?

186
00:12:49,647 --> 00:12:51,654
Sure. Knock yourself out.

187
00:12:53,498 --> 00:12:55,051
No, don't use that quote.

188
00:12:55,098 --> 00:12:57,287
'cause I can just get him back,
get another...

189
00:12:57,354 --> 00:13:00,053
You know what, don't even bother, man.
He was old news 5 years ago.

190
00:13:00,109 --> 00:13:01,454
Where's the scotch?

191
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,587
Over here.
Listen, here's the thing,

192
00:13:03,654 --> 00:13:05,965
He's not on his game lately.

193
00:13:17,328 --> 00:13:21,088
This is almost exactly like
my first apartment in Georgetown.

194
00:13:22,628 --> 00:13:24,374
My mom wanted me to stay on campus,

195
00:13:24,421 --> 00:13:26,691
but I was determined
to make it, so...

196
00:13:26,747 --> 00:13:29,111
I waitressed on
the weekends to swing it.

197
00:13:29,177 --> 00:13:30,839
You must have been
a hell of a waitress

198
00:13:30,895 --> 00:13:32,614
to swing an apartment in georgetown.

199
00:13:32,877 --> 00:13:34,107
No, I sucked.

200
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,988
I only got by 'cause my mom
put money in my account every week

201
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,461
and we both pretended I didn't know.

202
00:13:40,235 --> 00:13:43,390
Looks like she was
studying to make movies.

203
00:13:44,979 --> 00:13:45,852
Rossi.

204
00:13:56,316 --> 00:13:57,631
Who is this guy?

205
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,021
Well, if you want to look into
a young girl's life today,

206
00:14:09,088 --> 00:14:13,025
you have to access her myspace,
facebook, and twitter accounts.

207
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:16,370
I'll call the sexiest
hacker on the planet.

208
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:35,228
I don't think he's going
to print that quote.

209
00:14:35,359 --> 00:14:36,542
Who cares?

210
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:39,042
You shouldn't say stuff like that
about your fans.

211
00:14:39,108 --> 00:14:40,931
Maybe I'll just jump off.

212
00:14:41,288 --> 00:14:43,098
I mean, I'm a vampire.

213
00:14:43,764 --> 00:14:45,569
Maybe I could just fly away.

214
00:14:45,888 --> 00:14:47,692
I don't like that kind of talk.

215
00:14:47,758 --> 00:14:49,233
What's wrong, Ray,

216
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,594
afraid you're gonna lose
your cash cow?

217
00:14:51,744 --> 00:14:53,641
What's happened to you?

218
00:14:54,451 --> 00:14:55,540
It doesn't matter.

219
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,466
Come on.
We used to have fun, remember?

220
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:59,422
I don't make music anymore.

221
00:14:59,497 --> 00:15:00,821
I make events.

222
00:15:01,538 --> 00:15:03,952
- I play a character.
- You sell records.

223
00:15:04,077 --> 00:15:04,881
It's...

224
00:15:05,255 --> 00:15:08,592
It's not as if I exactly light up
the sales charts anymore, anyway.

225
00:15:09,058 --> 00:15:10,530
You'll sell again.

226
00:15:10,671 --> 00:15:13,467
Ray, you may be the only
friend I have left, but...

227
00:15:13,571 --> 00:15:15,803
you're a pretty crappy liar.

228
00:15:18,975 --> 00:15:20,571
- I'm so sorry!
- ************

229
00:15:20,608 --> 00:15:23,545
It's my fault. It's my fault.
Let me help you.

230
00:15:25,993 --> 00:15:27,467
Interesting hand.

231
00:15:29,032 --> 00:15:30,327
Do you know who I am?

232
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,021
Yeah. I mean, you're the music guy.

233
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,664
This is your party, right?

234
00:15:35,711 --> 00:15:38,530
Yes. This is...
this is for me, but...

235
00:15:39,286 --> 00:15:42,021
I have a pocket full
of what will make us both

236
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,928
feel so much happier.

237
00:15:45,294 --> 00:15:46,222
You do?

238
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:47,830
So let's get out of here.

239
00:15:48,337 --> 00:15:49,151
Really?

240
00:15:49,236 --> 00:15:52,042
Yeah. Come on, let's go.
You won't be sorry.

241
00:15:54,712 --> 00:15:56,593
The saliva hasn't been DNA I.D.'D,

242
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,615
But we have it
going through the lab.

243
00:15:58,671 --> 00:16:01,028
You can have the samples sent over
to the local bureau lab

244
00:16:01,071 --> 00:16:02,258
and have them rush it.

245
00:16:02,286 --> 00:16:04,192
You should have something
by sometime tomorrow.

246
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:06,102
I'll have it sent right over.

247
00:16:07,248 --> 00:16:08,497
They're not bites.

248
00:16:08,628 --> 00:16:10,744
Look at the edges.
They're razor sharp.

249
00:16:10,922 --> 00:16:13,040
A tooth would leave
a ragged, torn edge.

250
00:16:13,096 --> 00:16:16,111
I have some photos of animal
bites on the table for comparison.

251
00:16:16,546 --> 00:16:18,696
Some sort of boring
instrument, then?

252
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,460
Very sharp and very efficient.

253
00:16:20,516 --> 00:16:23,014
Well, if it isn't a bite,
then the saliva,

254
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,788
is it from licking, afterwards?

255
00:16:25,975 --> 00:16:28,371
Maybe. I haven't seen
anything like it.

256
00:16:30,742 --> 00:16:33,287
Once an unsub like this
gets started...

257
00:16:33,569 --> 00:16:35,088
it only gets worse.

258
00:16:51,988 --> 00:16:53,684
This is chase manning,
news chopper 12,

259
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,322
over the 101 freeway
in the san fernando valley.

260
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,354
Apparently a second body
in as many days

261
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,354
has been found near an off-ramp.

262
00:17:00,814 --> 00:17:02,954
So much for keeping the media out.

263
00:17:03,925 --> 00:17:04,751
Penelope?

264
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:05,988
Are we in yet?

265
00:17:06,054 --> 00:17:07,109
All yours.

266
00:17:08,132 --> 00:17:10,828
I always feel skeevy going
through someone's life like this.

267
00:17:10,893 --> 00:17:13,387
Ok, so everything
looks like it's password protected,

268
00:17:13,454 --> 00:17:15,587
so you might not even be able to...

269
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,620
- You're in already, aren't you?
- The password was cullen.

270
00:17:18,887 --> 00:17:19,821
Of course.

271
00:17:19,887 --> 00:17:20,821
Colon?

272
00:17:20,887 --> 00:17:21,985
Cullen.

273
00:17:22,022 --> 00:17:24,120
The vampire family from "Twilight."

274
00:17:24,407 --> 00:17:25,791
What's "Twilight"?

275
00:17:26,073 --> 00:17:28,734
Do you ever read anything
other than technical books?

276
00:17:28,772 --> 00:17:30,329
Not much in english.

277
00:17:30,774 --> 00:17:33,124
Ok, I'll see what I can dredge.
My love is strong.

278
00:17:33,187 --> 00:17:34,694
Ok, thanks.

279
00:17:34,795 --> 00:17:36,067
How's the profile coming?

280
00:17:36,123 --> 00:17:38,129
I don't know.
I never really feel ready, you know?

281
00:17:38,203 --> 00:17:41,053
It'll be fine. I am gonna
go talk to Tara's BFF

282
00:17:41,072 --> 00:17:43,235
Before the media requests come
in and it gets too crazy.

283
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,365
What's a BFF?

284
00:17:45,069 --> 00:17:46,587
Best Friend Forever.

285
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,995
Should I go with you?

286
00:17:48,032 --> 00:17:50,252
No. You have a profile to deliver.

287
00:17:50,308 --> 00:17:52,444
I should really work
on it a little more.

288
00:17:52,651 --> 00:17:53,477
Reid.

289
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,332
What are you doing with my phone?

290
00:17:57,524 --> 00:17:58,829
Derek, hey, um,

291
00:17:58,891 --> 00:18:01,191
Spence is ready for the profile.

292
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:03,224
Why, yes, he is, right here.

293
00:18:04,367 --> 00:18:05,975
- *****
- I'll be back.

294
00:18:06,997 --> 00:18:07,816
Hey.

295
00:18:14,402 --> 00:18:16,759
All right, Reid.
We'll be right in.

296
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,021
Hotch, Reid's ready
with the profile.

297
00:18:20,088 --> 00:18:20,925
Good.

298
00:18:21,454 --> 00:18:24,360
Highway crew found her
just as the sun was coming up.

299
00:18:24,501 --> 00:18:26,278
How long's she been here?

300
00:18:26,503 --> 00:18:28,324
Barely even cold yet.

301
00:18:28,367 --> 00:18:30,468
- Hour, maybe.
- The liar.

302
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,936
The same message.

303
00:18:32,264 --> 00:18:34,587
Apparently it wasn't Tara-specific.

304
00:18:34,654 --> 00:18:36,354
I wonder what it means, then.

305
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,408
The first victim
on a consecutive day.

306
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,484
Detective Kim, can you have
your crime scene techs

307
00:18:40,503 --> 00:18:42,000
keep us apprised of the processing?

308
00:18:42,015 --> 00:18:43,664
We're ready with
a preliminary profile.

309
00:18:43,687 --> 00:18:44,783
That's quick.

310
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,420
So's this unsub.

311
00:18:50,569 --> 00:18:52,220
We aren't looking for a vampire

312
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:54,603
in the supernatural sense,
only in the sense

313
00:18:54,631 --> 00:18:56,921
that this unsub
has a very strong desire,

314
00:18:56,988 --> 00:18:58,520
a need, for human blood.

315
00:18:58,587 --> 00:19:01,220
Now, fortunately, vampirists
display several characteristics

316
00:19:01,287 --> 00:19:03,287
which will be helpful
in finding him.

317
00:19:03,354 --> 00:19:05,487
He will have cut himself repeatedly.

318
00:19:05,554 --> 00:19:07,120
It's called auto-vampirism,

319
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:09,007
essentially becoming
his own first victim.

320
00:19:09,072 --> 00:19:11,674
It's the way by which
he first tasted human blood.

321
00:19:11,768 --> 00:19:14,253
Most vampirists are
incredibly ashamed of this

322
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,594
and will wear long-sleeved
shirts in order to conceal it.

323
00:19:16,641 --> 00:19:19,520
Secondly, there will be
a long history of animal abuse,

324
00:19:19,587 --> 00:19:22,120
starting with smaller animals
such as insects and rodents

325
00:19:22,187 --> 00:19:24,335
and then working his way up
to larger things...

326
00:19:24,382 --> 00:19:25,554
dogs and cats.

327
00:19:25,621 --> 00:19:27,407
Though this is
a well-recognized component

328
00:19:27,491 --> 00:19:29,988
of the homicidal triad
seen in other serial killers,

329
00:19:30,054 --> 00:19:32,488
in the case of the vampirist,
it's more pronounced.

330
00:19:32,525 --> 00:19:34,037
There will, interestingly enough,

331
00:19:34,084 --> 00:19:37,473
not be any animal torture,
as with other psychopathologies.

332
00:19:37,598 --> 00:19:41,432
The killing isn't the point, it's merely
a means by which to obtain the blood.

333
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:44,054
Look hard at your animal
control sections records,

334
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,350
as far back as you can.

335
00:19:45,407 --> 00:19:48,006
They will probably have some record
of this unsub as an adolescent.

336
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:49,787
This guy also most likely lives

337
00:19:49,854 --> 00:19:51,886
in a poorly kept older home.

338
00:19:51,896 --> 00:19:54,954
He needs a house for the privacy,
not an apartment.

339
00:19:55,021 --> 00:19:58,082
It takes some time to drain
a body completely of blood.

340
00:19:58,222 --> 00:19:59,520
Uninterrupted time.

341
00:19:59,587 --> 00:20:02,988
This unsub also most likely
lives with an elderly woman,

342
00:20:03,054 --> 00:20:05,177
a grandmother, a mother,
even an aunt.

343
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:06,487
How could you know that?

344
00:20:06,554 --> 00:20:07,921
This type of mental illness,

345
00:20:07,988 --> 00:20:09,787
accompanied by extreme
schizophrenia,

346
00:20:09,854 --> 00:20:12,440
dominates a family's
entire existence.

347
00:20:12,487 --> 00:20:14,551
It often leads to a broken home,

348
00:20:14,607 --> 00:20:16,833
and a woman ends up
as primary caregiver.

349
00:20:17,067 --> 00:20:18,509
The men generally leave.

350
00:20:18,574 --> 00:20:19,696
And one more thing.

351
00:20:19,724 --> 00:20:22,044
This type of disorder
cannot be hidden for long.

352
00:20:22,072 --> 00:20:23,587
I guarantee you someone out there

353
00:20:23,654 --> 00:20:26,060
already knows this unsub
is very, very sick.

354
00:20:29,089 --> 00:20:31,122
You ok?
You all right?

355
00:20:31,187 --> 00:20:32,859
Should I...should I call somebody?

356
00:20:32,944 --> 00:20:34,787
Tell me what's happening.
Talk to me.

357
00:20:34,854 --> 00:20:36,120
Talk to me.

358
00:20:36,341 --> 00:20:37,454
Oh, my god.

359
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,221
I can't stop it.

360
00:20:41,137 --> 00:20:42,871
- I want to.
- Yeah.

361
00:20:42,996 --> 00:20:45,463
- But I can't stop it.
- *************

362
00:20:45,532 --> 00:20:46,659
You gotta help me.

363
00:20:46,697 --> 00:20:47,687
I know. I will.

364
00:20:47,754 --> 00:20:48,787
You gotta help me.

365
00:20:48,854 --> 00:20:49,787
I will.

366
00:20:49,854 --> 00:20:51,387
Are you all right?

367
00:20:51,452 --> 00:20:53,320
Talk to me.
I can't stop it.

368
00:20:54,809 --> 00:20:55,721
Come here.

369
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,220
We're gonna fix this, ok?

370
00:21:00,895 --> 00:21:02,764
I'm gonna fix this.

371
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,487
Agent Morgan, we've identified
this morning's victim.

372
00:21:07,554 --> 00:21:08,719
Erin Hickman.

373
00:21:08,747 --> 00:21:10,941
She worked for a caterer
at an event last night.

374
00:21:11,007 --> 00:21:13,035
They're still there cleaning up.

375
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:24,320
Where can I find Ms. Masters?

376
00:21:24,848 --> 00:21:26,088
She's right there.

377
00:21:26,172 --> 00:21:27,104
Thank you.

378
00:21:27,874 --> 00:21:29,480
Excuse me. Ms. Masters?

379
00:21:29,668 --> 00:21:31,088
I'm lieutenant Kim, LAPD.

380
00:21:31,163 --> 00:21:32,300
Is this about Erin?

381
00:21:32,413 --> 00:21:33,321
Yes, ma'am.

382
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,687
Is she really dead?

383
00:21:34,754 --> 00:21:36,387
Yes, ma'am.
I'm sorry.

384
00:21:36,826 --> 00:21:39,150
These are FBI agents
Morgan and Prentiss.

385
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,346
- FBI?
- Erin Hickman work for you?

386
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:44,019
Well, till last night. She walked out
on me In the middle of the party.

387
00:21:44,056 --> 00:21:45,722
Walked out?
All I know

388
00:21:45,769 --> 00:21:47,848
Is she was here one minute
and gone the next.

389
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:50,255
Was it uncommon for her
to be irresponsible?

390
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:53,172
Look, I don't want to
speak ill of the...

391
00:21:54,049 --> 00:21:55,824
She had a problem with drugs.

392
00:21:55,918 --> 00:21:56,943
Excuse me.

393
00:21:58,071 --> 00:21:58,916
Morgan.

394
00:21:59,514 --> 00:22:02,181
We saw a poster of him
in tara's house.

395
00:22:07,441 --> 00:22:08,554
Speak to me, vision.

396
00:22:08,621 --> 00:22:10,240
Garcia, give me everything
you've got

397
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:11,721
On a singer named Dante.

398
00:22:11,787 --> 00:22:13,951
Dante, the vampire guy?
I was just about to call you.

399
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:14,954
You know him?

400
00:22:15,021 --> 00:22:17,780
Uh, he's the one thing that all
of our victims have in common.

401
00:22:17,817 --> 00:22:18,878
What do you mean?

402
00:22:18,923 --> 00:22:21,554
They have cyber shrines
set up for this guy.

403
00:22:21,676 --> 00:22:24,184
They worship him.
They're obsessed with his music.

404
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:27,454
Well, his new album comes out
today and it's called "The Liar."

405
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,033
"The Liar," I know. And isn't that
what was written on them?

406
00:22:31,151 --> 00:22:32,613
Ok, uh, all of our victims,

407
00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:34,562
including the first two,
were diehard fans.

408
00:22:34,613 --> 00:22:36,330
Tara and Gina...
that's Tara's friend...

409
00:22:36,367 --> 00:22:38,132
They were practically
running his fan club.

410
00:22:38,202 --> 00:22:40,287
What about Erin Hickman,
our latest victim?

411
00:22:40,354 --> 00:22:42,420
Erin Hickman,
I haven't run across that name.

412
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:44,253
Ok, we need to talk
to this dante guy.

413
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,964
Garcia, can you get us an address?

414
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:47,602
That's gonna take a little while.

415
00:22:47,639 --> 00:22:49,976
These celebrities are protected
by layers of privacy.

416
00:22:50,052 --> 00:22:52,051
It's like finding
information on a deeply

417
00:22:52,116 --> 00:22:54,703
22423 Greenvale Circle,

418
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,764
Holmby Hills. GPS coordinates
are uploading to you now.

419
00:22:57,811 --> 00:23:00,287
And his name is
Paul Davies, by the way.

420
00:23:00,354 --> 00:23:02,220
Run him for a criminal record, too.

421
00:23:02,287 --> 00:23:03,220
You got it.

422
00:23:03,287 --> 00:23:04,520
Thanks, P.G.

423
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:07,211
I'd hate to think
what she could find out about me.

424
00:23:07,267 --> 00:23:10,154
Oh, I prefer
not even to consider it.

425
00:23:12,389 --> 00:23:14,577
It doesn't look like
a lot of poorly maintained

426
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,854
- single-family homes.
- No.

427
00:23:17,287 --> 00:23:18,535
I hate to ask this,

428
00:23:18,573 --> 00:23:20,723
but are your profiles
this far off sometimes?

429
00:23:20,789 --> 00:23:21,963
They haven't been yet.

430
00:23:22,047 --> 00:23:25,216
This probably isn't our unsub,
just a piece of the puzzle.

431
00:23:32,187 --> 00:23:34,422
I could get used to this.

432
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:47,699
This is definitely
not poorly maintained.

433
00:23:47,802 --> 00:23:50,901
One of these things does not belong.

434
00:23:52,021 --> 00:23:54,220
Hey, Garcia, can you
run a plate for me?

435
00:23:54,508 --> 00:23:55,907
This isn't our guy, is it?

436
00:23:55,982 --> 00:23:57,353
I highly doubt it.

437
00:23:58,432 --> 00:23:59,709
May I help you guys?

438
00:23:59,841 --> 00:24:00,703
Dante?

439
00:24:01,059 --> 00:24:01,883
No.

440
00:24:02,454 --> 00:24:03,778
You're not the singer?

441
00:24:04,005 --> 00:24:06,033
Dante's not my name.
He's a character I play.

442
00:24:06,158 --> 00:24:07,394
So who are you guys?

443
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:09,780
- We're investigating a murder...
- Sir!

444
00:24:09,905 --> 00:24:12,158
Would you mind coming in
to answer a few questions?

445
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:15,218
- Prentiss, what are you doing?
- That car is Erin Hickman's car.

446
00:24:15,343 --> 00:24:17,756
The victim's car.
Would you mind coming in, sir?

447
00:24:26,008 --> 00:24:28,813
This is Elizabeth chambers outside
the Los Angeles police department

448
00:24:28,938 --> 00:24:30,530
with a story we're still developing.

449
00:24:30,655 --> 00:24:32,428
The singer-songwriter known as Dante

450
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,597
has been taken into custody
by the FBI

451
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:37,934
as a suspect in a recent string
of murders in the Los Angeles area.

452
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,147
<i>- Dante!</i>
<i>- Dante!</i>

453
00:24:45,033 --> 00:24:46,786
What's it been, 30 minutes?

454
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,945
<i>What about your music?</i>

455
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:55,629
Welcome to the media
capital of the world.

456
00:24:56,214 --> 00:24:57,036
Oh, god.

457
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,871
How the hell did they
get here so fast?

458
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,385
Who knows?
They always do.

459
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:02,562
Now listen up.
We're gonna have to push through.

460
00:25:02,687 --> 00:25:04,731
Can you at least put a jacket
over me or something?

461
00:25:04,856 --> 00:25:07,046
<i>Do you have anything</i>
<i>you want to say?!</i>

462
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,714
If we're gonna go we gotta go now.

463
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,762
Back off! Back off!

464
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,351
Everyone back off!

465
00:25:16,476 --> 00:25:17,431
Back off!

466
00:25:19,796 --> 00:25:21,602
Back up, please! Back up!

467
00:25:21,996 --> 00:25:23,140
Back up!

468
00:25:28,614 --> 00:25:29,654
I'm with the FBI!

469
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:32,780
I have an official statement
if you'll just come over here, please.

470
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,139
Is he gonna be ok?

471
00:25:34,264 --> 00:25:36,065
He's got a gun.
Keep moving.

472
00:25:36,772 --> 00:25:38,666
Right in here.
Thank you very much.

473
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:43,291
Ok, this is just a preliminary
investigation right now.

474
00:25:44,465 --> 00:25:45,901
A lot of this doesn't add up.

475
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:48,259
We've been wrong before.

476
00:25:48,384 --> 00:25:49,417
Not this much.

477
00:25:50,238 --> 00:25:51,841
The plot thickens.

478
00:25:52,265 --> 00:25:55,310
He was arrested for domestic
violence 10 years ago.

479
00:25:55,435 --> 00:25:56,350
How bad?

480
00:25:56,475 --> 00:25:58,525
Well, Garcia was able
to find the battery charge,

481
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,474
but it was expunged, so who knows?

482
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,330
Again, welcome to celebrity justice.

483
00:26:02,455 --> 00:26:03,808
He's pretty agitated.

484
00:26:03,933 --> 00:26:04,937
I wonder why.

485
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:07,692
Celebrities out here aren't used
to being put in the box.

486
00:26:07,817 --> 00:26:10,318
This seems more than that, though.
I don't know.

487
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:12,896
These are people everyone falls
down around, defers to.

488
00:26:13,116 --> 00:26:14,770
Adulation is their norm.

489
00:26:14,895 --> 00:26:17,231
You know, Prentiss, that may be
a good way for you to play him.

490
00:26:17,356 --> 00:26:18,166
Me?

491
00:26:18,291 --> 00:26:20,780
You were the one who pointed at him.
He may see you as an adversary.

492
00:26:20,905 --> 00:26:22,304
Have him off-guard.

493
00:26:24,811 --> 00:26:26,508
So, what did you tell the press?

494
00:26:26,633 --> 00:26:29,037
My official statement was
that I hate Los Angeles.

495
00:26:29,162 --> 00:26:30,365
What's happening?

496
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:31,917
Prentiss is gonna take the lead.

497
00:26:32,042 --> 00:26:32,995
Good choice.

498
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,467
Remember, if he is the unsub,
he's ashamed of the disorder,

499
00:26:35,592 --> 00:26:37,912
- so use that to your advantage.
- Tell him you can't believe

500
00:26:38,037 --> 00:26:40,263
that someone like him could do this.
Throw him a lifeline.

501
00:26:40,388 --> 00:26:41,208
Right.

502
00:26:41,428 --> 00:26:43,015
Ask him for his autograph.

503
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,612
Oh. Right. Right.

504
00:26:46,819 --> 00:26:47,952
Adulation.

505
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,504
Mr. Davies.
Have a seat, relax.

506
00:26:53,308 --> 00:26:54,162
Relax?

507
00:26:54,287 --> 00:26:56,197
How the hell am I supposed to relax?

508
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:57,479
Please sit.

509
00:26:57,709 --> 00:26:59,784
I've been trying to call my manager,

510
00:27:00,379 --> 00:27:01,702
but I can't get a signal.

511
00:27:02,138 --> 00:27:05,263
These interrogation rooms don't
usually have cell service.

512
00:27:05,388 --> 00:27:07,570
Is there another phone
that I can use? I...

513
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,599
I think there's been
a really big mistake.

514
00:27:10,724 --> 00:27:12,129
There's been no mistake.

515
00:27:13,161 --> 00:27:16,717
I'm sure that you couldn't have had
anything to do with what's happened.

516
00:27:17,297 --> 00:27:18,245
Really?

517
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:20,785
I mean, you're the one
that brought me in here.

518
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:23,015
The police gave me
some bad information.

519
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:24,860
You're not the police?

520
00:27:24,985 --> 00:27:27,395
Good, she's confusing him.
Schizophrenics can't follow that.

521
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:29,355
Neither one of us
is the type of person

522
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:32,608
who belongs in
a police interrogation room.

523
00:27:32,878 --> 00:27:35,455
Supervisory special agent
Emily Prentiss,

524
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,154
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

525
00:27:37,612 --> 00:27:38,531
FBI?

526
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:41,771
And, of course, I know who you are.

527
00:27:44,065 --> 00:27:45,887
I'm a big fan.

528
00:27:46,917 --> 00:27:47,832
Really?

529
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:49,921
Does that surprise you?

530
00:27:50,477 --> 00:27:52,420
Yeah. Yeah, that's a surprise.

531
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:54,201
Ok. Well,...

532
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:56,415
before we get started...

533
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,127
would you mind?

534
00:28:01,642 --> 00:28:02,804
Would I mind what?

535
00:28:02,929 --> 00:28:04,409
Well, I hate to ask,

536
00:28:04,534 --> 00:28:07,560
but I don't usually get
opportunities like this.

537
00:28:08,087 --> 00:28:10,813
What the hell is this?
You're no fan of mine.

538
00:28:11,715 --> 00:28:13,399
You people think I'm stupid.

539
00:28:13,738 --> 00:28:16,892
That kind of contradiction should
completely confuse a schizophrenic.

540
00:28:17,017 --> 00:28:18,360
They can't make sense of it.

541
00:28:19,421 --> 00:28:20,972
Am I suspected of something?

542
00:28:21,143 --> 00:28:22,904
What's the name of your new album,

543
00:28:23,029 --> 00:28:24,704
the one that comes out today?

544
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,618
- Is she...
- Dead? Yes.

545
00:28:29,743 --> 00:28:32,126
With the name of your new
album written on her.

546
00:28:33,556 --> 00:28:35,073
It's a common phrase.

547
00:28:35,198 --> 00:28:37,390
Is it?
It seems a little odd to me.

548
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:38,976
The instead of a.

549
00:28:39,101 --> 00:28:41,844
And this girl went home
with you last night.

550
00:28:45,527 --> 00:28:46,402
She's dead?

551
00:28:48,742 --> 00:28:50,144
Can you explain that?

552
00:28:53,756 --> 00:28:54,815
I... I don't...

553
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,070
- I don't remember.
- You don't remember hurting her?

554
00:28:59,877 --> 00:29:00,695
No.

555
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:01,779
No.

556
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:06,364
Their blood was drained.

557
00:29:07,538 --> 00:29:09,789
From holes in their throats.

558
00:29:10,401 --> 00:29:11,207
What?

559
00:29:11,952 --> 00:29:14,335
Are you a vampire, Mr. Davies?

560
00:29:14,738 --> 00:29:16,413
You can't be serious.

561
00:29:16,538 --> 00:29:19,078
It's a character I play,
a stage act.

562
00:29:19,203 --> 00:29:21,103
You know, sometimes
things get out of hand.

563
00:29:21,228 --> 00:29:22,292
No, no.

564
00:29:22,921 --> 00:29:24,945
This is... this is crazy.

565
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:28,784
I don't know how that girl
ended up like that.

566
00:29:32,928 --> 00:29:34,480
I think I need my manager here.

567
00:29:35,478 --> 00:29:38,493
You're gonna do this all on your own,
just like a big boy.

568
00:29:38,781 --> 00:29:40,861
But I have the right to a lawyer.

569
00:29:41,215 --> 00:29:42,937
Are you asking for an attorney?

570
00:29:43,062 --> 00:29:45,903
No. I'm asking to speak
to my manager

571
00:29:46,028 --> 00:29:47,576
so he can find one.

572
00:29:51,509 --> 00:29:52,623
I need a phone.

573
00:29:53,175 --> 00:29:54,708
I need to make a call.

574
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,230
I need to make a call.

575
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:02,103
There's nothing you can do
when they lawyer up, Prentiss.

576
00:30:02,228 --> 00:30:03,194
Dr. Reid here.

577
00:30:03,697 --> 00:30:05,136
Spence, what's going on?

578
00:30:05,466 --> 00:30:08,475
The possible suspect's
some sort of rock and roll star.

579
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,432
Seriously?

580
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:11,353
A lot of it doesn't fit
the profile, though.

581
00:30:11,478 --> 00:30:14,228
- Anything I can do?
- There's a lot of media attention.

582
00:30:14,455 --> 00:30:16,614
All right.
Well, I'm already here at Gina's house,

583
00:30:16,739 --> 00:30:18,505
so let me get some info
and I'll be back.

584
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:20,001
Great. Thank you so much.

585
00:30:20,837 --> 00:30:23,070
- None of this makes any sense.
- No.

586
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,797
Television is saying his new record
is selling through the roof.

587
00:30:25,922 --> 00:30:27,192
All of his stuff is.

588
00:30:27,507 --> 00:30:31,000
As soon as his being questioned in an
actual string of murders became public.

589
00:30:31,125 --> 00:30:33,539
What do they say?
Any publicity's good publicity.

590
00:30:34,556 --> 00:30:35,990
What are we gonna do with him?

591
00:30:37,421 --> 00:30:38,227
Hotchner.

592
00:30:38,352 --> 00:30:40,212
Well, he wants to talk
to his manager, so...

593
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,215
maybe we let him make that call
and find out what that guy knows.

594
00:30:44,034 --> 00:30:45,153
It's worth a try.

595
00:30:48,953 --> 00:30:49,790
You sure?

596
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,183
Ok, thanks.

597
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:53,976
- Something?
- That's the lab.

598
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:56,245
The saliva samples
from the victims' throats...

599
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:57,737
the DNA's from a woman.

600
00:31:04,773 --> 00:31:06,413
Stop. Don't to that.

601
00:31:06,538 --> 00:31:08,522
Grandma's asleep.
She's gonna wake up.

602
00:31:08,647 --> 00:31:11,271
So you have to stop it.
I need to go to the yard.

603
00:31:11,396 --> 00:31:12,228
Gina.

604
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:24,893
Gina.

605
00:31:26,188 --> 00:31:28,010
- Gina.
- I'm with the...

606
00:31:29,128 --> 00:31:30,424
FBI.

607
00:31:38,823 --> 00:31:40,773
A woman?
That's incredibly rare.

608
00:31:41,054 --> 00:31:42,282
But not impossible.

609
00:31:42,407 --> 00:31:44,380
No, but renfield's with
this type of aggression...

610
00:31:44,505 --> 00:31:47,000
- it almost never presents this way.
- We knew something was wrong.

611
00:31:47,125 --> 00:31:49,031
Our profiles have never
been this far off, Reid.

612
00:31:49,156 --> 00:31:50,603
Go back and work it with a woman.

613
00:31:50,728 --> 00:31:52,732
See if there's anything
we may have missed.

614
00:31:57,284 --> 00:31:59,357
You wanted to call your manager.

615
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,446
Can I have some privacy?

616
00:32:01,571 --> 00:32:03,049
That's not how it works.

617
00:32:13,715 --> 00:32:14,562
Ray.

618
00:32:14,687 --> 00:32:17,077
Holy hell, man,
the record's gone through the roof.

619
00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:18,394
What do you mean?

620
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:21,730
It's flying off the shelves.
I told you I'd fix it.

621
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:24,059
I told you.
Yeah, everything's good.

622
00:32:24,184 --> 00:32:25,560
You're gonna be back on top,

623
00:32:25,685 --> 00:32:27,611
everything's gonna
go right back to normal,

624
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,843
- you can stop doing the drugs.
- Ray,...

625
00:32:30,363 --> 00:32:33,029
I'm at the police station
with the FBI.

626
00:32:33,154 --> 00:32:35,017
I know, I know, I know.
Don't worry about it.

627
00:32:35,142 --> 00:32:37,206
- Don't worry?
- No, don't... don't worry about it.

628
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:39,579
Look, there's nothing that
could be tied to you,

629
00:32:39,704 --> 00:32:42,167
absolutely nothing.
It's all good, man.

630
00:32:42,459 --> 00:32:44,336
Come on, let's go.
Yes.

631
00:32:46,352 --> 00:32:47,579
What did you do, Ray?

632
00:32:47,704 --> 00:32:49,639
The less you know
about it the better.

633
00:32:49,764 --> 00:32:52,183
Look, I gotta take care
of this thing,

634
00:32:52,308 --> 00:32:53,708
and then I'll be right back.

635
00:32:53,833 --> 00:32:56,523
I'll be down there.
Let me just fix this.

636
00:32:56,648 --> 00:32:59,048
- Ray...
- Hey, relax, would ya?

637
00:32:59,263 --> 00:33:00,769
It's gonna be all right.

638
00:33:08,663 --> 00:33:10,434
Did he do something?

639
00:33:12,487 --> 00:33:13,607
I don't know.

640
00:33:14,203 --> 00:33:15,496
What did he say?

641
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,870
He said he'd be down to fix it.

642
00:33:18,999 --> 00:33:20,039
Fix what?

643
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:23,292
Fix this, I suppose.

644
00:33:23,792 --> 00:33:26,283
But he didn't ask you
what "this" was.

645
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:29,440
No.

646
00:33:32,467 --> 00:33:33,278
Gina.

647
00:33:35,171 --> 00:33:35,980
Gina.

648
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:38,319
My name is Jennifer Jareau.

649
00:33:39,422 --> 00:33:40,861
Gina, where'd you go?

650
00:33:51,105 --> 00:33:52,154
Gina...

651
00:33:57,051 --> 00:33:58,386
Who the hell is that?

652
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:02,956
What kind of fan mail
do you get, Mr. Vampire?

653
00:34:04,262 --> 00:34:06,269
A woman... what changes,
what doesn't?

654
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:23,873
Older female...

655
00:34:30,023 --> 00:34:31,318
Oh, no.

656
00:34:34,134 --> 00:34:34,940
Yeah.

657
00:34:35,065 --> 00:34:36,292
Uh, Reid,

658
00:34:36,644 --> 00:34:38,580
I found fan mail to Dante.

659
00:34:38,705 --> 00:34:40,285
Vampire fan mail.
It's bananas.

660
00:34:40,499 --> 00:34:42,621
- Obsessional?
- Ad infinitum and beyond.

661
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,665
Tara's friend Gina...

662
00:34:44,876 --> 00:34:46,874
the stuff she writes...
she...

663
00:34:46,999 --> 00:34:49,490
he's her god.
A vampire god.

664
00:34:49,615 --> 00:34:51,755
She lives for him.
She said she'll kill for him.

665
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,806
And she fits every other
piece of the profile.

666
00:34:53,931 --> 00:34:54,925
Guys!

667
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,761
The girl Tara was with before
she died Gina... it's her.

668
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,723
- Do you have an address?
- Yeah. I think JJ is there right now.

669
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:02,013
Let's go.

670
00:35:03,644 --> 00:35:05,235
<i>Who the hell is she?</i>

671
00:35:05,465 --> 00:35:06,979
<i>I'm so upset.</i>

672
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,784
It's all going to go bad.

673
00:35:10,065 --> 00:35:12,562
Forget that. You've got...
you've got to kill her.

674
00:35:13,917 --> 00:35:15,322
<i>It's all going bad.</i>

675
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:17,406
<i>Listen to me,</i>
<i>we've got to help Dante.</i>

676
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:19,241
<i>You gotta help Dante again.</i>

677
00:35:19,562 --> 00:35:20,868
- Dante?
- Yeah.

678
00:35:21,999 --> 00:35:23,941
He's... he's... he's gonna be angry.

679
00:35:24,066 --> 00:35:25,835
No, no, no, no.
I promise.

680
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,381
He'll only be angry
if you don't kill this woman.

681
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,169
<i>Listen,</i>

682
00:35:30,722 --> 00:35:32,977
<i>you gotta hurt one more girl</i>

683
00:35:33,324 --> 00:35:36,091
and then you'll be able
to join him in the undead. Ok?

684
00:35:41,878 --> 00:35:43,974
- She isn't answering.
- Keep trying.

685
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:47,644
<i>You don't understand!</i>

686
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,471
<i>I do. I do understand.</i>

687
00:35:49,596 --> 00:35:51,012
<i>You just have to do one more</i>

688
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:52,945
<i>and Dante will be able to live then.</i>

689
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,039
<i>Just one?</i>

690
00:35:54,164 --> 00:35:55,746
<i>Just this one more girl</i>

691
00:35:55,908 --> 00:35:59,337
and then you can join the undead,
just like we promised.

692
00:35:59,462 --> 00:36:02,894
<i>You said that Tara was the last one.</i>

693
00:36:03,019 --> 00:36:06,068
That's what you said. You said.
Now it's the other girl...

694
00:36:06,193 --> 00:36:07,456
This is the last one.

695
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:09,166
The last one that you have to do,

696
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:11,770
and then you can join Dante
and be the undead.

697
00:36:11,895 --> 00:36:14,620
Just like we talked about, remember?
Remember?

698
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,550
Just one more?

699
00:36:18,205 --> 00:36:20,172
- Just one...
- Just one more.

700
00:36:20,442 --> 00:36:21,836
And then yourself.

701
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:24,348
Just like he promised.

702
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:26,546
Just one... ok.

703
00:36:26,886 --> 00:36:27,947
Just one.

704
00:36:28,538 --> 00:36:30,354
- Last one.
- Last one.

705
00:36:30,764 --> 00:36:33,009
Take it.
Go on, take it.

706
00:36:34,237 --> 00:36:35,393
Beautiful.

707
00:36:37,249 --> 00:36:38,355
Where did she...

708
00:36:40,842 --> 00:36:42,032
Don't move.

709
00:36:44,484 --> 00:36:45,322
Hey!

710
00:36:48,984 --> 00:36:49,790
JJ?

711
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:50,791
JJ?

712
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:52,084
In the back!

713
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:56,680
Mine. This is mine.
It's mine. You can't...

714
00:36:56,805 --> 00:36:58,507
You can't have it.
Go away.

715
00:36:59,314 --> 00:37:00,456
Go away.

716
00:37:06,692 --> 00:37:07,546
JJ.

717
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:11,387
Show me your hands!
Let me see your hands!

718
00:37:11,512 --> 00:37:13,713
It's ok. It's ok.
Get your hands clear!

719
00:37:13,838 --> 00:37:17,389
No, no, please, you have to...
No, no, no, no! No, no, no!

720
00:37:17,514 --> 00:37:18,819
The blood is going bad!

721
00:37:18,944 --> 00:37:20,359
Please!
Please don't do this!

722
00:37:20,484 --> 00:37:22,155
- Are you armed?
- No, no, no.

723
00:37:22,453 --> 00:37:24,550
- No.
- Go, go!

724
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:27,671
Hey, I got nothing to do with this.
Hey, it's not me.

725
00:37:28,004 --> 00:37:29,281
It's the chick.

726
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:31,995
It's got nothing to do with me.

727
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:36,920
Has something happened?

728
00:37:38,038 --> 00:37:39,822
It was your manager.

729
00:37:40,321 --> 00:37:42,581
He used a fan of yours.

730
00:37:43,736 --> 00:37:44,645
What?

731
00:37:44,883 --> 00:37:46,813
A young girl.
She'd been writing you letters

732
00:37:46,938 --> 00:37:49,141
about wanting to kill someone
for their blood.

733
00:37:49,711 --> 00:37:51,751
I never...
I never received anything.

734
00:37:52,195 --> 00:37:53,297
No, he did.

735
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:55,879
And I guess he thought
he could use it for publicity.

736
00:37:56,004 --> 00:37:57,209
He was right.

737
00:37:57,334 --> 00:37:59,735
Your new album is selling very well.

738
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,214
I never asked for that.

739
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:04,686
Well...

740
00:38:07,142 --> 00:38:08,076
Where is he?

741
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,609
Your manager?
He's in custody.

742
00:38:10,734 --> 00:38:12,748
Is he ok?
Is there anything I can do for him?

743
00:38:13,197 --> 00:38:15,417
He's gonna need a good lawyer.

744
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:16,834
What about the girl?

745
00:38:16,959 --> 00:38:19,504
I don't know where she'll end up.
She's pretty sick.

746
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:23,133
I'd like to help her, too, if I can.

747
00:38:25,409 --> 00:38:27,304
That's all?
I can go now?

748
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:29,837
That's all.

749
00:38:35,602 --> 00:38:36,670
You know,...

750
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:39,101
all I really ever wanted to do

751
00:38:39,226 --> 00:38:40,359
was make music.

752
00:38:41,547 --> 00:38:44,071
And I'm not sure when
that stopped being enough.

753
00:38:59,188 --> 00:39:02,354
Hey, do you guys think Davies will
continues to perform as Dante?

754
00:39:02,479 --> 00:39:05,371
The character's probably responsible
for the murder of 4 women.

755
00:39:05,496 --> 00:39:07,545
If he has any conscience at all,

756
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:09,179
Dante died with them.

757
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,473
- Thanks.
- Are you ok?

758
00:39:12,465 --> 00:39:14,768
Yeah. Doctor said
it'll be sore for a while, but...

759
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:16,144
I'm fine, really.

760
00:39:16,538 --> 00:39:19,106
I feel so bad I didn't go
with you to interview Gina.

761
00:39:19,314 --> 00:39:20,641
Spence, stop, all right?

762
00:39:20,766 --> 00:39:23,470
We had no way of knowing
she was gonna be dangerous.

763
00:39:23,595 --> 00:39:25,414
She was just the friend of a victim.

764
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:29,606
Granted, a schizophrenic friend
with a sociopathic partner.

765
00:39:30,572 --> 00:39:31,741
And a shovel.

766
00:39:31,866 --> 00:39:33,739
Seriously, Reid,
we had no way of knowing

767
00:39:33,864 --> 00:39:35,752
that Gina had that type
of anger inside of her.

768
00:39:35,877 --> 00:39:37,505
Yeah, but she was
obsessed with Dante.

769
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:40,471
I should have known that that level
of fixation can lead to manipulation.

770
00:39:40,596 --> 00:39:42,870
But only when the fixation's
coupled with schizophrenia,

771
00:39:42,995 --> 00:39:44,474
which we had no way of knowing.

772
00:39:45,016 --> 00:39:48,675
Still it never ceases to amaze me
how dark obsession can get.

773
00:39:48,952 --> 00:39:50,345
And with a pop star?

774
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,305
I mean,
I was obsessed with the rat pack,

775
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:55,047
but I wouldn't have
killed for Frank or Dean.

776
00:39:55,172 --> 00:39:57,443
No, you just drank
whiskey and smoked cigars.

777
00:39:57,568 --> 00:40:01,023
This from the man who's favorite
record is the Beatles' white album.

778
00:40:01,912 --> 00:40:03,403
Just because manson hijacked it

779
00:40:03,528 --> 00:40:05,388
doesn't have to ruin it
for the rest of us.

780
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:07,398
That's why I stick to Beethoven.

781
00:40:07,523 --> 00:40:09,978
There's no chance
of guilt by association.

782
00:40:11,329 --> 00:40:12,777
Well, yeah.

783
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:16,747
Have you ever seen a movie
called "a clockwork orange"?

784
00:40:24,081 --> 00:40:25,635
Writer Cyril Connolly said,

785
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,198
"better to write for yourself
and have no public

786
00:40:28,323 --> 00:40:31,093
than to write for the public
and have no self."
