1
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,550
I thought about you all day.

2
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,180
Don't stop.

3
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,380
We shouldn't. Vincent is downstairs.

4
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,350
We'll just be real quiet about it.

5
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,700
Oh,this is wrong.

6
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,740
Excuse me. You,uh--you--
you dropped something.

7
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,160
Hey,almost done. Think
I got a bite. A couple.

8
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:59,140
One more potential,and then I'm home.

9
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,540
What? Honey,I'm at work.

10
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,450
I love you,too. Gotta go.

11
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,300
Robert,right?Ok,I gotta tell you,robert,

12
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:17,990
of all the houses I have on the
market,this one is my favorite.

13
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:21,010
My name's not robert. Not robert.

14
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,460
I'm sorry.

15
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,840
Where are you going?
Where are you going?

16
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,220
Her name's michelle watson,a realtor
murdered in buffalo a week ago.

17
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,850
Until yesterday they had nothing,no
leads,and then they got this.

18
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,600
Buffalo P.D.received it from
an unknown source yesterday.

19
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,460
They able to trace it?

20
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,050
No. Sent through an
encrypt server from ukraine.

21
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,950
There's no sound.

22
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:25,350
Yeah,at first glance there doesn't seem to
be a single frame to identify who shot it.

23
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:26,790
He even covered up the mirror.

24
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:30,150
I've seen some crazy things
sitting at this table,but that...

25
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,450
Why send that to the police?

26
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:34,820
Well,maybe it's a taunt,to
show the police how smart he is.

27
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,820
Catch me if you can.

28
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,580
The two people
in the video--

29
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:41,960
They look directly at the unsub and neither
one seems to register that they're being filmed.

30
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,530
I think it's probably a hidden camera.

31
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:46,320
The witnesses were able to
give us enough for a sketch.

32
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:49,490
White male,early 30s,wearing glasses.

33
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,820
It looks like an editing suite.

34
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,990
So he not only films
the murder,he edits it.

35
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,170
Do we know what this is
that's playing on the monitor?

36
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:59,310
Buffalo P.D.is concerned that it
might be another filmed killing.

37
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,860
If it is,then we're not looking
at just one murder,but two.

38
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,550
Buffalo is underfunded,undermanned,and
they need our help.

39
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,920
Buffalo's a big gang town.

40
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,710
Murder in the last year
alone was over 700 people.

41
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:11,760
Garcia,I need you to go througthis frame
by frame and put everything on disks.

42
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,150
Yes,sir. I'm on it.

43
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,500
Also,put together a go bag.

44
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:18,780
If we get any more of these films,I
want you on the ground taking point.

45
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:22,590
- Is that ok with you?
- Yes,sir. Excellent. Ok.

46
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,570
- Fast forward...
- Go bag. I don't have a go bag.

47
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,700
There's something I
want everyone to see.

48
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,410
He's writing something.

49
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:42,440

"in order for the light to shine so
brightly,the darkness must be present."

54
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,490
Francis bacon.

55
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,980
A serial killer asking for
help. Wellthat's a new one on me.

56
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,730
Attempt at sarcasm?

57
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,910
What if he's sincere?

58
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,540
Then he's deeply ambivalent.

59
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:29,500
He wants to stop,but like
an alcoholic,he simply can't.

60
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,040
When we see him driving,his
point of view is elevated.

61
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,320
I'd say he's driving a van or an suv.

62
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:37,010
And the film stops where
it starts--at his home.

63
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:41,060
So we could use the film to trace back,street
by street,from the crime scene,right?

64
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:42,570
It only lasts 9 minutes.

65
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:47,720
And in this frame,he clearly
looks at a clock,and it's 9:22.

66
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:51,920
Ok,the autopsy says michelle watson's
time of death was 4:30 in the afternoon.

67
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:54,240
So,he edited out 7 hours.

68
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:58,830
Garcia,look for unsolved murders of
men in their early 30s who were stabbed,

69
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,140
Buffalo and surrounding
cities. Go back 10 years.

70
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,810
Wouldn't vicap have
already picked up on that?

71
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,500
Mm,vicap only went
web-based about a month ago,

72
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,500
and buffalo P.D.only
recently uploaded the data.

73
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:11,370
They show watson holding a day planner.
They find that at the crime scene.

74
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:15,530
Yeah,that,her wallet,and all of her
jewelry,including a 3-carat diamond ring.

75
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,080
So we know he's not
financially motivated.

76
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,990
First count--i
have 22.

77
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:24,200
22? We had 6. You think
it could be that many?

78
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,190
We went back 10 years and
included surrounding cities.

79
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,150
The unsub may be out
of his comfort zone.

80
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,740
Now,they may not all be connected,but
they all match michelle's type.

81
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:34,020
Blond,white,eay 30s.

82
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:37,030
The autopsy reports will help us determine
which of these cases is connected.

83
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,150
I'll get them here right away.

84
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,370
We also need to take a look at the
crime scenes,detective henderson.

85
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,200
Of course.

86
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,480
I'll stay and help reid.

87
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,240
I'll take prentiss and morgan.

88
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:52,700
Tell me,do you think this is a
one off or can I expect more films?

89
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,710
It's not a one off. The filming of his
kills makes him a sexual psychopath.

90
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:00,710
We'll find more. Many
more. Just like this one.

91
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:37,300
Help me is in direct cflict with
the psychology of a psychopath,

92
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,940
and it's something
I've never seen before.

93
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,110
Psychopaths don't have the capacity
to feel empathy towards others.

94
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,790
They can mimic it,but
they can't feel it.

95
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:44,890
Then he didn't mean it?

96
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:48,170
Or someone or something is
showing him who he really is.

97
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:51,710
Ok,friends,the video
on this film is analog.

98
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,460
It's since been digitized,but
it is seriously degraded.

99
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,190
Meaning what?

100
00:09:55,230 --> 00:10:00,120
Meaning this kind of degradation only happens over
at least a decade and thousands of repeated viewings.

101
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,760
'S the only way he can get any release.

102
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:04,150
Then you're right. He's
been doing this for 10 years.

103
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,890
Uh,more like 20. That
woman in this video--

104
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:09,180
She's wearing a sweater I
haven't seen since flashdance.

105
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:15,220
On the day of her death,the 21st,michelle
entered the name robert at 4 p.m.

106
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,630
Ah,we found no one connected to her with
that name and we think it's an alias.

107
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:24,790
Michelle's highly organized,she's
precise,light of hand,so left-handed.

108
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:25,690
How can you tell?

109
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:29,290
The hardest point is where she starts,the
lightest point is where she tails off.

110
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:33,640
In her case,she tails off
to the right. It's weird.

111
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,990
- What?
- I'm not sure,

112
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:40,710
but the number 29 is circled twice in
red ink and it tails off to the left.

113
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,230
Whoever wrote that is right-handed.

114
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:47,830
That person is right-handed
and "help me" is written in red.

115
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,150
The unsub wrote the circled 29.

116
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,190
Guys... Tomorrow's the 29th.

117
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,960
Hotch is in position,so
let's walk through this.

118
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,800
Ok,prentiss,michelle stood right here...

119
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:05,610
- Facing me.
- Ok. Door's still open.

120
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:08,200
She didn't shut it. And now
she turns her back to it.

121
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,410
That's her first mistake.

122
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:14,740
Ok,she's on the phone
with her husband. 3:55 p.m.

123
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,530
She tells him she has
another client coming.

124
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,970
Here comes the unsub. But you don't
turn around. Just keep talking.

125
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,640
- Now the unsub's in the house.
- Yeah,I hear him.

126
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,810
You hear him,but you
don't turn around. Not yet.

127
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,450
Now you turn.

128
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,820
Because if she leaves the front
door open and she turns her back,

129
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,670
she must have been expecting robert.

130
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,950
It's an open house. There's no one
else here. He knew she'd be alone.

131
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:39,680
She's standing face to face with the
unsub,talking to him,and yet she still turns away.

132
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,200
Second mistake.

133
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,380
He poses no threat.

134
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,260
Yeah,and if she'd seen a
camera,she would have registered it.

135
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:47,760
Now she turns,faces the unsub...

136
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,830
He strikes... Right into her chest.

137
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,940
And then he drags her
over here to the sofa...

138
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,640
And he films her death.

139
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:01,060
He chose a controlled environment
in which he could ensure privacy.

140
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,960
No witnesses,and most importantly,he
didn't have to dump the body.

141
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,750
Garcia?

142
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,720
Prentiss,the
point of view--

143
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,370
She didn't see the camera because
the glasses have to be the camera.

144
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,980
Thanks,garcia.

145
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,780
He left us another message.

146
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:19,390
He circled the number 29
in michelle's day planner.

147
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,880
So we've only got 24 hours to stop him.

148
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,010
Thanks.

149
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,320
Morgan thinks the unsub's
glass are the camera.

150
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:48,410
You need to get a sketch of the unsub
out to every camera shop in buffalo.

151
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,880
If he hunts within a comfort zone,then whichever
of these camera shops he visits the most,

152
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,050
That's the one he'll live closest to.

153
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,720
All right. You heard the man.

154
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,170
Ok,hotch also wants us to focus on
victims found in controlled locations.

155
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,670
Secure areas with little
chance of witnesses.

156
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,370
And ones where he left the
bodies where he killed them.

157
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:08,560
Ok,based on that,june '98,

158
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:12,320
emily flyn,found in her
apartment,stabbed 23 times.

159
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,340
Hillary habner,march 2000,found
in her basement,stabbed 18 times.

160
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:21,210
Cindy stagnal,april 2001,stabbed
multiple times,found in her office.

161
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:25,590
And may 1999,vanessa bright,29,stabbed
and found in her studio.

162
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:29,980
Ladies and gentlemen,it appears
as ough we've found our timeline.

163
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:34,020
It looks like our killer strikes
almost exactly every 12 months.

164
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,350
Oh,my god.

165
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:38,080
All these women,and he got away with it.

166
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,180
I think we need to inform the media.

167
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:42,770
Buffalo has a serial killer.

168
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:46,230
Every so often,he's stopping
and looking down at the ground.

169
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,080
- At what?
- I don't know.

170
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,290
But it's clear he's trying to
step around some type of objects.

171
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,760
There aren't any objects.

172
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,100
Well,at least not the we can see.

173
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,850
But remember in the film he cut
the sandwich and turned it twice?

174
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:59,510
And the 29th was circled twice in red.

175
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:02,450
So this isn't a message. This
is something he has to do.

176
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,760
It's the cracks in the pavement.

177
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,240
That's what he's stopping for. He's
stepping over them because he has to.

178
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,030
He's obsessive-compulsive.

179
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:15,620
Meaning no matter how hard he
tries,he simply can't stop himself.

180
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,420
Well,if he wanted to,he
could have turned himself in.

181
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,420
By writing "help me," he
really means "stop me."

182
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,890
Go away,go away,go away...

183
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:08,520
Vincent,it's alice. I
know you're in there.

184
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,800
Ok. Just a moment.

185
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:31,310
How you doing?

186
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,890
Where have you
been,vincent? 'S been weeks.

187
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:39,200
For a single guy,you're so neat.

188
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,630
- What's in there?
- Nothing.

189
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,700
How did you find me?

190
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:49,090
I dropped you off after
the conference,remember?

191
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,730
Aren't you gonna offer me a drink?

192
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:54,440
I'm--I'm
not thirsty.

193
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:59,260
I--i meant-- you're
weird. But cute.

194
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,350
Alice,you know,it's--
it's not really ok.

195
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:05,040
It's not really ok that you
just come by my home like this.

196
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,290
You should--you
should go.

197
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:10,450
No,I came because there's a wedding tomorrow
and they want you to film and edit it.

198
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,430
I mean,you're the best,vincent.

199
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:16,140
Well,uh,I'm not doing that anymore.

200
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,660
Why?

201
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:23,810
It's really late,and I'm tired.

202
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:27,290
You should go,alice,yes,please.

203
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:33,690
The same suspect. Keep in mind...

204
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:36,300
Vincent,that looks a lot like you.

205
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:39,310
And he may use hats or other
means to hide his appearance.

206
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,420
This man has a type.

207
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,570
He kills women,blond women,in their 30s,

208
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,680
and he kills them where they feel safe--
 In their homes,in their workspace...

209
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:53,230
- Vincent?
- I have to change my glasses.

210
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,210
There was no purse,no
jewelry,nothing to i.d.her with.

211
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,710
Whereas with michelle he
didn't care what he left behind.

212
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,600
He knew we couldn't connect her to him.

213
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,550
Why did he cover her up and
fold her arms across her chest?

214
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:14,410
She can't be more than 24.

215
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,910
That doesn't fit his victimology.

216
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,590
Well,the chest wound matches
that of michelle watson.

217
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:21,310
The way he's positioned
her,the blanket,shows remorse.

218
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:23,170
He probably knew her more
intimately than the others.

219
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,520
That's somewhat of a leap.

220
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:27,510
Not when you consider this is
the first time he dumped the body.

221
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,970
Unlike the others,he brought
her body here and dumped it.

222
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:33,140
Yeah. Someone will be missing her soon.

223
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,190
Today's the 29th. He probably
killed her last night.

224
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:39,370
Whatever his plans
are,he still has them.

225
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:42,270
We're ready to give the profile.

226
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:46,980
We've confirmed 11 kills over
a 10-year period. This makes 12.

227
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,090
All but one blond,white female,mid
- to late 30s.

228
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:53,990
- Be careful.
- Time me.

229
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:57,080
Stanley,be careful.

230
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,770
This unsub has extreme
obsessive-compulsive disorder.

231
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,490
This woman doesn't fit his victimology.

232
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,760
He probably didn't target
or even mean to kill her.

233
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,350
5 camera shops in buffalo
were shown this sketch.

234
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:16,780
The owner of tarquinio's camera
shop on union road recognized it.

235
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,750
He knows him only as vincent.

236
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:23,400
He bought two 3-millimeter mini wireless
cameras and had them retrofitted to his glasses.

237
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,080
He's well-versed in camera technology.

238
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:27,640
He probably generates
income from a related field.

239
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,650
So stake out the shop,but
keep a low profile.

240
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,760
He walks in off the street,he politely
waits his turn,he pays in cash.

241
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,000
This is him. Black
overcoat,black baseball cap.

242
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,870
You'll get more from your sketch.

243
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,050
Now,this last kill
shows the most remorse.

244
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:45,320
This guy's mobile. Most likely in
a suv. Low-profile,mute in color.

245
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,230
He's beginning to devolve.

246
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:50,620
His ocd will get worse and
he'll have a hard time hiding it.

247
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:54,050
He will take bigger and bigger
risks to achieve his ultimate goal.

248
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:57,700
In michelle's watson's day
planner,he circled the number 29.

249
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,390
Today is the 29th.

250
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:02,230
So we believe he may have
something planned for today.

251
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,850
Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.

252
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:24,150
He sent us this film as
his way of reaching out.

253
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,840
He may be ambivalent,but
his ocd won't let him stop.

254
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,530
Now,if he sees a heavy police
presence and he's not done,he'll run.

255
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,600
The east side is his comfort
zone. This is where he lives.

256
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:37,500
However random,anything out of
the ordinary,please let us know.

257
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,480
Thank you very much.

258
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:42,690
Tell me again what the
autopsy report said.

259
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,710
He seems to be killing once a year.

260
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,170
And they were all,except
for michelle watson,overkill.

261
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,490
He stabbed her just once.

262
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,890
And hers was the only kill he
sent footage of to the police.

263
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:54,010
- That's a definitive change.
- You're right.

264
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:56,180
Call reid and prentiss. Tell them
to go over the autopsy report again.

265
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,500
We need to know why.

266
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,010
He sure does like his blondes.

267
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:07,200
Not a good date,though. Too stabby.

268
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:10,000
Less so,though,with michelle watson
and the girl we found this morning.

269
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,340
Every one of these murders
happens during a month of spring.

270
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:16,270
So,spring for the unsub is a stressor.

271
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,170
Do you think my video
was done in the spring?

272
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,990
- There's a good chance.
- Ok.

273
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:23,310
Eighties,spring,buffalo.

274
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,910
Search for homicide,see
if I can make a connection.

275
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:29,910
All of the victims except for michelle watson
were killed within a year of each other.

276
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:33,620
Victim number 10,joyce
wolcott,stabbed 32 times.

277
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,730
And then michelle watson was
stabbed just once 2 years later.

278
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:40,880
What's missing from the michelle watson
murder is any sign of rage or overkill.

279
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,430
Yeah. Instead,on the tape
we see signs of remorse.

280
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,630
A complete and sudden emotional
change. It's absolutely fascinating.

281
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:49,840
I loveou,reid,but the stuff
you find fascinating is sad.

282
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,160
Ok. The woman in my video...

283
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,690
She looks a lot like the ones
on your board,don't you think?

284
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,580
So he's killing her over and over again.

285
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:58,670
Maybe. I don't know. Not my job.

286
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,230
Guys,there was an actual witness
In the jce wolcott murder.

287
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:04,750
- a witness?
- A boy. Her son.

288
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:24,090
53 seconds. You were faster
the first time. What happened?

289
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:26,420
Ran over a cat.

290
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,180
- Did you kill it?
- It's a joke. I'm joking.

291
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,820
I know.

292
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,340
Happy birthday,stanley.

293
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:39,680
- King for the day,right,vincent?
- Right.

294
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:44,100
I made you a promise.
Do you remember it?

295
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,540
Of course.

296
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,470
So hold out your hand,palm up.

297
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:55,360
No way. For real?

298
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,130
Tonight. It's here tonight.

299
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,870
But you can't tell
anyone,ok? Just tell no one.

300
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:02,190
- You promise?
- Promise. No one.

301
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:07,410
- So listen out for me,ok?
- Ok.

302
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:11,190
Hey,vincent.

303
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:14,490
You know nothing will happen
if you step on them,right?

304
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,740
You're a kid. What do you know?

305
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,190
Neighbors called the police when they
heard her son stan screaming for his mother.

306
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,540
Let's see,they were found in
the backyard and she was dead.

307
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:28,880
So he saw the whole thing?

308
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:32,370
If he did,why didn't the unsub
kill the only living witness?

309
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,860
- Did they interview him?
- He was traumatized.

310
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,710
- Did he see the killer?
- He didn't see anything.

311
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:39,600
Where is the boy now?

312
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,250
Single mom,father
dead in a car accident.

313
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:45,280
He was foster-homed after her death.

314
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:47,280
Tell me he's still in buffalo.

315
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,150
Yes.

316
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:57,560
How you doing there,kid?

317
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,090
We're looking for stanley wolcott.

318
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,750
Who wants to know?

319
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,910
My name's derek morgan.
I'm with the FBI.

320
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:04,870
FBI? Cool.

321
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:08,420
Today's your birthday,right?

322
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:12,040
- Can I help you?
- FBI.

323
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:15,070
I'm sorry to do this today of all days.

324
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:18,960
But we need to talk to
stanley. It's urgent.

325
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,740
Stanley's been with me for 9 months now.

326
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,430
The adoption papers
came tough last week.

327
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:13,400
So we're moving to california.

328
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,660
Uh,stanley's been blind since birth.

329
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,800
His mom didn't want him
to use a cane,so,he,uh...

330
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,420
My way around life.

331
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:23,490
It's called echolocation.

332
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:27,870
It's where the sound bounces off
objects,kind of like a bat uses sonar.

333
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,080
I'm the batman.

334
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,740
Well,hey,batman.

335
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:37,110
Self and my colleague here,dave,we
need to ask you some questions.

336
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:43,380
This is about my mom,isn't it?

337
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,600
Yeah,it is.

338
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,720
- And I need to ask you--
 - Have you found him?

339
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,450
I can feel a lie.

340
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:58,890
We're looking for him,stan.

341
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:00,580
We could use your help.

342
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:03,920
Now,what I'm asking you to
do probably won't be easy.

343
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:06,840
- Will it help you catch him?
- It might.

344
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,360
I'm not sure about this.

345
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,290
It ok. I want to.

346
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,820
That a boy.

347
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:25,170
Ok. 2 years ago,on that night,you
were playing in the snow with your mom.

348
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,300
She said my lips were turning blue.

349
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,960
She told me to go in and get warm.

350
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,610
She said it was getting dark.

351
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:42,300
So then you came inside and
you took off your gloves.

352
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,030
You took off your
jacket. And you got warm.

353
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,850
But after a while,she
didn't come back in.

354
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:52,050
Mom? Mom?

355
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:53,990
Stanley,what do you hear?

356
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,600
The snow is so thick.

357
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:00,420
It covers the house,the yard.

358
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,220
Everything's so quiet.

359
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:05,830
You call out for her,but
she doesn't call back.

360
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:08,780
Mom? Mom!

361
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:12,470
Now I hear something.

362
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,030
What do you hear?

363
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,370
I think I can hear my mom.

364
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:18,210
Is she talking?

365
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,690
Crying.

366
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,830
Now what do you do?

367
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:26,690
Go outside.

368
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:29,860
Stanley,we can stop doing
this now if you want.

369
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,980
No. It's ok. I can do this.

370
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,130
You're doing good,stanley.
You're doing really good.

371
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:40,260
I'm right here,ok?

372
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,530
Mom?

373
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,520
Can you hear her?

374
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:53,830
No. I need to find her.

375
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,770
Mom?

376
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:04,330
- Stanley...
- Someone's here.

377
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:07,350
I can feel them.

378
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:10,140
It's not my mom.

379
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:16,220
That's enough. Enough. That's enough.

380
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:22,190
He saw me... Didn't he?

381
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:27,500
Yes,stan,he did.

382
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:55,060
Hey,what's up,man? Looks like
you know where you're going.

383
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,920
- I don't want any trouble.
- See,I don't know you.

384
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:05,050
- I don't want any trouble.
- Look,you said that twice.

385
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:07,290
What you doin' walkin'
around here,anyway,huh?

386
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:10,620
You ain't lost.

387
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,680
Hey,man. Hey,look at me.

388
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:19,480
All right,come on. You walk like you know where
you're going,so you gotta know what's next.

389
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,280
See,this here's my street.

390
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,170
And you pay to walk on my street.

391
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:41,050
I've been thinking about you all day.

392
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,560
You shouldn't have been.

393
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:11,250
- What the hell is this? Get out of my house!
- No,wait.

394
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,660
How can you do this with
our son in the house?

395
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:19,280
So what? I don't care.

396
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,330
I hate you!

397
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:25,080
I hate you! I hate my life!

398
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:38,150
Mom?

399
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,870
Mommy! Mom?

400
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,920
He just came out of
nowhere. He rolled up on us.

401
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,970
- Which way was he walking?
- That way.

402
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,020
He's heading east.

403
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,480
So your friend shot him,the man
defended himself,and you did nothing?

404
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,470
You ran away and called 911?

405
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:08,830
I'd done talking,fed.
I ain't saying nothin'.

406
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:10,690
I want my lawyer.

407
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:13,050
You'll get a lawyer. Answer my question.

408
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,650
- He shot him once.
- Where?

409
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:16,530
In the stomach.

410
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:18,390
What was he doing when
you rolled up on him?

411
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:21,870
Head down,walking real fast,like
he was late for something.

412
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:23,580
So you jumped him.

413
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,960
When he didn't give you what
you wanted,what did he do?

414
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:27,380
At first nothing.

415
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,500
He just started making
this noise with his tongue.

416
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:31,950
- What kind of noise?
- Ok,listen to me.

417
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:35,170
Yeah,like that. Exactly like that.

418
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:38,370
And he slammed jay with a knife
and turned and came after me.

419
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,760
It's called echolocation.

420
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:44,750
The unsub's 10th victim-- she left behind a
blind son who uses echolocation to get around.

421
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,020
How would the killer know that?

422
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:48,400
Because he saw the boy was blind
the night he killed his mother.

423
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:51,150
And I think that's why
he didn't kill the boy.

424
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:55,470
Wait a second. Today's that
kid's birthday. He's the event.

425
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:59,720
Henderson,get units to meet us
at 6518 cantwell drive right now.

426
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:10,620
He's gone! He's gone. I thought he
was in his room. He said he was tired.

427
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,850
- When was the last time you checked on him?
- 20 minutes ago.

428
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:14,600
- Did you hear anything?
- I just don't understand.

429
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:17,070
- He would have had to pass me to get out.
- Kate,think.

430
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:19,180
When you checked on
stan,he was asleep,yes?

431
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,330
He was under the covers.

432
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,300
You closed his door. You went
to your room. You settled down.

433
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,550
- I watched tv.
- Did you hear anything?

434
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:28,390
I,um,I heard a car horn beep twice.

435
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:30,050
I looked out the window,but
I didn't see anything.

436
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:32,610
- He's gotta have 20 minutes on us.
- Oh,god.

437
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:34,410
Oh,my god,he's gonna kill him,isn't he?

438
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,620
Let's just take a look inside.

439
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:45,700
Are you ok?

440
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:51,670
The FBI came to my house.

441
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:57,230
The FBI.

442
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,300
The man that killed my mom...

443
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:03,590
He stood right next to me,in the snow.

444
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,220
He could have killed me,but he didn't.

445
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:11,190
Well,maybe he saw something in you.

446
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,890
Well,what did he see?

447
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,960
I don't know.

448
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:21,070
But,uh...

449
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:23,650
You know,it stopped him.

450
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:26,260
Stopped him from hurting you.

451
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:29,840
He's back.

452
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,430
He did a bad thing.

453
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:37,840
He did a--he did a very--
 A very bad thing,but...

454
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:41,790
When he saw you,he knew...

455
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:46,720
He knew that he couldn't
hurt you. He knew that...

456
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:51,860
He'll never-- he'll
never ever hurt you.

457
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:58,020
I wish he'd killed me.

458
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:30,590
There's blood here.

459
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,620
- Oh,no,please.
- It's not stan.

460
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:35,870
We believe the man who took
stan was injured. It's his blood.

461
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:38,170
We think his name is vincent.

462
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:39,840
- Vincent?
- You know him?

463
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,610
Stan knew him before he came to me.

464
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,380
- For how long?
- For over a year.

465
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,160
He was a registered helper
in a mentoring program.

466
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:49,300
- Which one?
- Oh,god. Stan has belonged to so many programs.

467
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,050
I can't remember where he met vincent.

468
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:54,190
Garcia,I got a
name--vincent.

469
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:56,180
Morgan,I'm gonna need a surname,honey.

470
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,570
She can't remember.

471
00:34:57,610 --> 00:35:02,100
Can you at least cross-reference vincent's name
with all of the mentor organizations in buffalo?

472
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:04,010
I think we'll get more from the video.

473
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:05,100
We're running out of time.

474
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,610
Come on,garcia,we gotta find this kid.

475
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:09,130
Trust me,ok? Give me a second.

476
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:12,700
That's her. That's the
woman from the film.

477
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,980
June 5,1983.

478
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,600
Kim rowlings was killed in her home.

479
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,590
When police arrived,they
found her son vincent rowlings.

480
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:22,690
- Garcia--  - thank me
when we've got an address.

481
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:25,390
Vincent was found sitting with
the body of his murdered mother.

482
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:28,230
Police believe that he sat
with her for more than 24 hours.

483
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,380
He was only 9 years old.

484
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:34,370
He filmed his mother's murder and hid
the tape from the police all these yearS.

485
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:37,500
vincent rowlings, 5605 1/2
pearl street,east side,buffalo.

486
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,000
Tell hotch we're en route. I love you.

487
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,980
FBI!

488
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:48,310
Clear.

489
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:53,900
I hate you! I hate you! I hate my life!

490
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:57,480
Get off of me!

491
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:08,540
Garcia,I need you to
conference everybody now.

492
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,570
Hotch,you've got rossi and morgan.

493
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,630
And we have stan's
foster mother kate here.

494
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,130
Stanley is missing,and there's
blood on the windowsill.

495
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:17,340
Kate,did vincent take stan out?

496
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:19,400
Was there a favorite
place they liked to go?

497
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,630
A park? Playground?

498
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:25,880
No. No. Like I said,I only allow him to see
stan under this roof,under my supervision.

499
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:28,510
He's been coming around more since
I told him we were moving away.

500
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,270
When did you tell vincent that?

501
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:32,190
Like a week ago. Why?

502
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:35,600
- What?
- He killed michelle watson over a week ago.

503
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:38,930
That must be the stressor that
triggered vincent's behavior change.

504
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:43,070
Kate,vincent's drawn the number 29
with a circle around it numerous times.

505
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,700
Today is the 29th.

506
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:48,270
We believe the circle may
represent a specific location.

507
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,080
They would have talked about it,or he
might even have taken him there before.

508
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:53,640
Did vincent talk to stan about
adventures that they could take?

509
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,960
Places they could visit?

510
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,700
What are stanley's
favorite things to do?

511
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:00,900
He just likes to make things. To
build things. Vincent used to help him.

512
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,780
- The construction sets?
- Yeah.

513
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:09,860
Ferris wheel. It's a circle.

514
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,420
When did he build this?

515
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,870
Over the last couple of months.
He's been in here every night.

516
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:18,060
Garcia,check buffalo and the surrounding areas
for any theme parks,permanent or visiting.

517
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:22,260
- Theme park just outside of buffalo.
- Ferris wheel?

518
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:25,320
Yes!

519
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,850
Let's go.

520
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:28,930
You both go. I'll stay
here in case he comes back.

521
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:31,260
I want to go over everything and
see how many others we've missed.

522
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,360
Got it.

523
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:48,120
What do you see?

524
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,920
Tell me,vincent. What do you see?

525
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:54,570
So many colors.

526
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:56,840
Lights everywhere.

527
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:59,440
Is it here? The ferris wheel?

528
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:01,930
It's here. It's...

529
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,810
Is it like the one we built? Is it?

530
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,590
Exactly.

531
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,780
Then let's go.

532
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:27,060
- Are you ok,buddy?
- Yeah.

533
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:30,680
I just get a little nervous at heights.

534
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,570
Just don't look down.

535
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:39,890
He,uh,he wants to stop it at
the top. C-can you do that?

536
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:41,610
Yeah,sure.

537
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:44,810
Just close your eyes. Like me.

538
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:52,060
It's going up.

539
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:05,070
Move! FBI! Out of the way!

540
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:13,520
Is it beautiful?

541
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:16,400
Can you see the stars,vincent?

542
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:18,150
Can you see the stars?

543
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,890
There's thousands of them.

544
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,150
They're all over the sky.

545
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:26,540
I bet if you lean forward,you
can reach for them.

546
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:31,160
I got you.

547
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:38,620
Remember you said you'd
wished he'd killed you?

548
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,830
- He's up top!
- Out of the way! Out of the way!

549
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:52,410
You can never,ever wish to be dead.

550
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,360
Never wish for that.

551
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,930
I saw my mom die,too.

552
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:12,800
And like my father,I did some
bad things. I did some bad things.

553
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:15,780
What are you talking about?

554
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,080
You're gonna hear things.

555
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:23,660
You're gonna hear bad things about me.

556
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:28,770
But you can never,ever wish to die,stan.

557
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:34,030
Because you're special.

558
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:36,600
How am I special?

559
00:40:55,840 --> 00:41:00,960
Because you helped me to see. To see.

560
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,830
Can--can we go
around one more time?

561
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:11,780
I need you to get this kid
off the wheel. Do it now.

562
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,480
I don't think so.

563
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:20,700
I wish you were my dad.

564
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,950
Forgive me.

565
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:26,760
Do it now!

566
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:35,740
Ok,stop there.

567
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:42,010
Now open it. Stanley,it's
derek from the FBI.

568
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:44,200
It's ok. Sit
tight. Stanley--

569
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:47,320
- What's going on?
- It's me,derek.

570
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:51,580
- Vincent,what's--  What's
going on? - Listen to me.

571
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,250
I need you to come with
me. Let go of vincent.

572
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:57,070
Just come with me. I'm
getting you out of here.

573
00:41:57,090 --> 00:42:02,410
That's right. That's right.
It's gonna be ok. You're ok.

574
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:04,490
Vincent?

575
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:15,550
It's ok. It's fine.

576
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:17,680
Oh,honey!

577
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:27,850
Derek.

578
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:35,180
What's up,kid?

579
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:43,510
Did he kill my mom?

580
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:11,670
"no matter how dark the moment,
love and hope are always possible."

581
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,410
George chakiris.
