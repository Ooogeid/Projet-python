1
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:09,260
I'm telling you, you're gonna love it.

2
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:10,700
Do you think so?

3
00:00:10,735 --> 00:00:11,455
Yeah.

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,235
Look, it's great.

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,020
I saw it forever ago on vhs.

6
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:15,030
Campy.

7
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:15,870
Fun.

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:24,380
2.

9
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:25,810
Thank you.

10
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:27,025
Enjoy the show guys.

11
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,000
Thank you. Thank you.

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,110
Enjoy the show.

13
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,160
Ah, don't worry, it's not that scary.

14
00:00:35,195 --> 00:00:36,150
That's lame.

15
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,030
I- I mean it's - It's kind of scary,

16
00:00:39,065 --> 00:00:40,670
But, uh, mostly funny, you know?

17
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,745
How funny?

18
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,580
Well, it's... heh.

19
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,900
Just don't spill it, jesse.

20
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:52,940
Jesse...

21
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:58,625
Where do you want?

22
00:00:58,660 --> 00:00:59,970
It doesn't matter to me.

23
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:00,835
There?

24
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,135
No, that's too close.

25
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:03,310
Thought it didn't matter.

26
00:01:03,345 --> 00:01:04,415
Well, just not too close.

27
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:06,340
You know you're gonna fall asleep anyhow.

28
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,090
Ok, stop.
What?

29
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,360
Air.

30
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,240
And i'm getting razor burn.

31
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,100
Oh,my god!
What?

32
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,570
Fire! Fire!

33
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,070
Come on, let's go. Get up.

34
00:02:40,562 --> 00:02:41,579
Get the door!

35
00:02:45,597 --> 00:02:47,614
Cathy! Cathy!

36
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,280
Move, man!

37
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,190
There's the fire exit!

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,890
Cathy, run!

39
00:03:02,665 --> 00:03:03,665
Run!

40
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,100
Oh, my god!

41
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:12,340
Help! Somebody help us!

42
00:03:09,025 --> 00:03:10,025
This way!

43
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,560
Get the door! Hurry!

44
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,130
Help! Help! Help!

45
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,260
Somebody help us!

46
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,750
Mom!
Jesse!

47
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,990
Jesse, where are you?!

48
00:03:29,065 --> 00:03:30,065
Cathy!

49
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,130
Get us out! Somebody get us out!

50
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,900
This is news footage from a movie theater

51
00:03:41,935 --> 00:03:44,332
In royal, indiana, population 2,000.

52
00:03:44,367 --> 00:03:46,730
Earlier tonight 19 people were killed.

53
00:03:46,765 --> 00:03:47,715
And they're sure it's arson?

54
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:51,030
Yeah. 2 days ago the same thing happened
at the local recreation center.

55
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:53,015
12 victims, no survivors.

56
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,515
I heard about that. Yeah, it was all over the news.

57
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,945
There were some details that didn't make the news.

58
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,445
A week and a half earlier there
were some fires at a convenience store,

59
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,910
A local restaurant. Luckily,
it was after hours and no one was hurt.

60
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:09,160
So whoever set these went 
from no victims to 31 in 2 weeks.

61
00:04:09,195 --> 00:04:10,532
That's a hell of an escalation.

62
00:04:10,567 --> 00:04:11,968
Why didn't they call us in sooner?

63
00:04:12,003 --> 00:04:13,491
The local police and fire department

64
00:04:13,526 --> 00:04:15,318
Knew they were dealing with an arsonist,

65
00:04:15,353 --> 00:04:17,110
But they had no idea he'd become a killer.

66
00:04:17,145 --> 00:04:18,365
Most arsonists don't.

67
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,555
They just like setting fires.

68
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:22,150
Any deaths that occur
are almost always accidental.

69
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,415
31 victims is not an accident.

70
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,080
The police chief knows he made a mistake.

71
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:27,905
And he learned the hard way

72
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,000
That even though not all arsonists are killers,

73
00:04:30,035 --> 00:04:31,450
They do have one thing in common-

74
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,650
Once they start, they can't stop.

Tennessee williams said,

00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,760
"We all live in a house on fire.

80
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:20,540
No fire department to call, no way out. "

81
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,480
Based on the limited population of royal,

82
00:05:23,515 --> 00:05:26,100
The unsub is most likely a local male

83
00:05:26,135 --> 00:05:27,912
Between the ages of 17 and 30.

84
00:05:27,947 --> 00:05:29,690
What, arson is a sexist industry?

85
00:05:29,725 --> 00:05:30,825
For the most part, yeah.

86
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,975
Only 12% of arsonists are female.

87
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,440
Apparently women just aren't inclined
to burn things.

88
00:05:35,475 --> 00:05:37,192
Let's go with the numbers. Focus on males.

89
00:05:37,227 --> 00:05:38,910
Well, we can scratch hero complex off the list.

90
00:05:38,945 --> 00:05:40,635
He hasn't left anyone to save.

91
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:43,670
Yeah,but we can't rule out firefighters
and other first responders.

92
00:05:43,705 --> 00:05:46,670
How's about i do a background 
check on all local firefighters and emts?

93
00:05:46,705 --> 00:05:47,817
And flag anyone with a history

94
00:05:47,852 --> 00:05:49,096
Of being first on the scene.

95
00:05:49,131 --> 00:05:50,305
Or anyone with a juvenile record

96
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,375
That includes vandalism or small nuisance fires.

97
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:56,360
I will look at everything from firebug to flamethrower.

98
00:05:56,395 --> 00:05:57,815
Did you check out the news footage?

99
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,750
I want the word out that we'd like to see

100
00:05:59,785 --> 00:06:01,615
Any personal videos or photos of the fire.

101
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:04,280
Arsonists like to watch,
and if our unsub stuck around,

102
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,510
Maybe somebody will recognize him.
 I'm on it.

103
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,930
Locals find anything in their call logs

104
00:06:07,965 --> 00:06:09,375
That resemble the unsub's m. O.?

105
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,875
I mean,he may have staged practice runs.

106
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,305
According to the fire chief's report

107
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,160
There was nothing similar in the past year.

108
00:06:14,195 --> 00:06:15,942
Garcia, extend your search statewide.

109
00:06:15,977 --> 00:06:17,655
The unsub may have done his practicing

110
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,930
Far enough away so as not to arouse suspicion.

111
00:06:19,965 --> 00:06:21,985
Thank you. I will cast a wide net, sir.

112
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,150
I grew up in a small town.
People are gonna assume

113
00:06:24,185 --> 00:06:25,705
Anyone we question is guilty.

114
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,810
The last thing we want is for this
to turn into a witch hunt.

115
00:06:28,845 --> 00:06:30,310
It's exactly what this is. We're just gonna have to

116
00:06:30,345 --> 00:06:31,940
Keep the locals from realizing it.

117
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,545
Garcia, i want you to find out everything that you can

118
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,410
About the 31 victims,
and i don't mean just their paper trail.

119
00:06:37,445 --> 00:06:39,980
I need to know everyone related to them,

120
00:06:40,015 --> 00:06:41,105
Everybody they owed money to,

121
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,850
Everybody they had an argument with.

122
00:06:42,885 --> 00:06:43,835
Sir, if i'm hearing you right,

123
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,325
You're saying i'm the witch hunter.

124
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,780
That's exactly what i'm saying.

125
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,485
Chief Carlson,

126
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,310
Agent Jareau, this is agent hotchner.

127
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:02,590
Thank you for coming.

128
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,905
I know i should have called you in earlier.

129
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:08,670
So... anything you need, anything at all,
you got it.

130
00:07:08,705 --> 00:07:10,657
What we're going to need most is your help.

131
00:07:10,692 --> 00:07:12,575
It's a horrible tragedy, and it's gonna take

132
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,300
Everyone working together to prevent another one.

133
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17,630
You think he's gonna try to do it again?

134
00:07:17,665 --> 00:07:18,365
We know he will.

135
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,570
And with his escalating timeline,

136
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:20,870
It's gonna be soon.

137
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,420
We, uh...

138
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,030
We didn't have enough room in the hospital

139
00:07:33,065 --> 00:07:34,070
For everyone.

140
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,690
This-This way, please.

141
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:48,710
Doc Rawlings.

142
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,105
You're the FBI agents.

143
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,030
Well, thank god Carlson called you.

144
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,560
I'm agent Hotchner, this is agent Jareau.

145
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:01,395
That's Mary Elise. She lost her husband.

146
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,735
That's Alice starrett with chief Carlson.

147
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:06,040
Her parents were both at the movie theater.

148
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,650
Mike-His oldest son and his girlfriend were there.

149
00:08:09,685 --> 00:08:10,895
So was my nephew.

150
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:13,160
Everybody in the room lost somebody.

151
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,790
When i first heard about it,
i just came right here.

152
00:08:15,825 --> 00:08:18,170
I had my nurses bring equipment,
set up triage.

153
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,530
Nobody needed it. They were-

154
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,235
They were all dead.

155
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,480
Every single one of them.

156
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,205
I wish i could tell you this is the worst of it,
but i can't.

157
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,330
When he strikes again,
he's gonna be aiming for even more victims.

158
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,425
My god.

159
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,755
You need to send everybody home.

160
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,600
Large gatherings like this are a bad idea.

161
00:08:34,635 --> 00:08:36,365
All right. Dr. Rawlings.

162
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,765
When i spoke to the police chief,

163
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,760
He said that you know everyone in royal.

164
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,995
Well, pretty much. I grew up here.

165
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,010
I inherited my father's practice.

166
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,310
I delivered 11 of those people lying in there.

167
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,730
There is a strong probability
that the killer is local.

168
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,400
You think somebody from royal did this?

169
00:08:53,435 --> 00:08:54,885
It's usually the case.

170
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,020
We want to handle this investigation
as gently as possible,

171
00:08:58,055 --> 00:08:59,495
Without pointing fingers.

172
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:02,820
What we're asking you to decide
is what's more important,

173
00:09:02,855 --> 00:09:04,580
People's privacy or their safety?

174
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,150
Most of the victims died of smoke inhalation,
thank god.

175
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,240
A few of them were trampled.

176
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,840
My cousin Gary and his wife Linda.

177
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:45,870
If you need some time...

178
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,990
We're talking gasoline and matches.

179
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,555
And this was the point of origin.

180
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,090
The second one was in the lobby?

181
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,530
This one burned the longest.

182
00:09:55,565 --> 00:09:56,470
Slower, too.

183
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,050
Less oxygen, less fuel.

184
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:01,790
He used a lot more gas in the lobby.

185
00:10:01,825 --> 00:10:03,497
Place went up like a haystack.

186
00:10:03,532 --> 00:10:05,170
What about the sprinklers?

187
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,630
Bastard turned off the main water line.

188
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,290
You know, the unsub could have set this fire first.

189
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,155
Lobby burned harder and faster,

190
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,500
Forcing the victims out this way,

191
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,475
Where he'd already blocked the exit.

192
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:27,620
And where the smoke from the slower
Burning fire had already built up.

193
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,900
And whoever did do this knew that even if the fire department

194
00:10:30,935 --> 00:10:33,170
Got here in time to stop the fires...

195
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,265
Cathy!

196
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,240
They still wouldn't have been able to save them.

197
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,930
Me and Daniel are both volunteers.

198
00:10:48,965 --> 00:10:50,180
The whole company is.

199
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,720
Got about 20 firefighters,

200
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,225
Plus our own ladder truck and pumper.

201
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,410
An emt runs a 2-Person crew 24/7.

202
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,850
We managed to get it out pretty fast.

203
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,380
Not fast enough.

204
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:03,730
All those people.

205
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,525
Who would have so much hate?

206
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,280
Someone whose rage has been building for years.

207
00:11:09,315 --> 00:11:10,825
But what he did, i...

208
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,565
The unsub knew exactly what he was doing.

209
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,270
He's been practicing for a long time.

210
00:11:16,305 --> 00:11:18,375
Nuisance fires, vandalism.

211
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,405
He may have even burned himself.

212
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,420
Well, that sounds like every teenage boy
who's ever grown up in royal.

213
00:11:23,455 --> 00:11:24,515
I don't know if you noticed,

214
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:27,250
But there's really not a lot to do here.

215
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:30,040
You have our reports.
All the records are in there.

216
00:11:30,075 --> 00:11:31,525
Maybe so,

217
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,780
But we all know there are times when things...

218
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,970
Don't get reported.

219
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,290
Times when you're...

220
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,660
Just trying to protect someone,

221
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,150
Just trying to, um,

222
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,500
Make the situation go away.

223
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,295
We're just trying to help people out.

224
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,500
Sometimes the best way to do that is to forget

225
00:11:51,535 --> 00:11:52,800
That it ever happened.

226
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,630
We're gonna need to know about those times.

227
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,800
I have been through every piece of footage i could find.

228
00:12:03,835 --> 00:12:05,345
No one sticks out at the fires.

229
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,720
No one appears to be inappropriately voyeuristic.

230
00:12:07,755 --> 00:12:09,170
No one with bandages.

231
00:12:09,205 --> 00:12:10,395
Yeah. Garcia?

232
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:14,090
No firebug firefighter, no flammable juvie records,

233
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:17,175
However, of the 128 reported instances

234
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,320
Of petty larceny and vandalism in the last year,

235
00:12:19,355 --> 00:12:21,430
There are a few names that sort of stick out,

236
00:12:21,465 --> 00:12:23,505
So i'm emailing you those photos.

237
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:27,510
I also have a pattern of small gasoline fires
about 300 miles away.

238
00:12:27,545 --> 00:12:28,875
A town called Franklin.

239
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:31,665
Got a, uh, trash can fire, a christmas tree,

240
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,060
And an abandoned shed.
 And i sent you that file.

241
00:12:34,095 --> 00:12:35,925
Given the 500-Mile search radius,

242
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,660
There's bound to be a certain percentage of nuisance fires.

243
00:12:38,695 --> 00:12:40,860
We can't necessarily attribute that to our unsub.

244
00:12:40,895 --> 00:12:44,835
With a gasoline accelerant-

245
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,650
Our unsub and this guy.
Nice work, Garcia.

246
00:12:46,685 --> 00:12:47,635
What about the victims?

247
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:50,660
Well... given that i've had less than 8 hours,
i can't really

248
00:12:50,695 --> 00:12:52,640
I appreciate the time constraint.
What have you found?

249
00:12:52,675 --> 00:12:55,730
Uh, a mixture of ages and genders.

250
00:12:55,765 --> 00:12:56,765
Mostly local.

251
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,595
A cousin visiting from a nearby town.

252
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,960
Is there any crossover between the victims 
and the 2 towns, Garcia?

253
00:13:00,995 --> 00:13:02,807
Hey, it's a little teeny tiny town.

254
00:13:02,842 --> 00:13:04,620
There's nothing but crossover. Um...

255
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,985
Alex Nagel
He was killed in the rec center.

256
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,640
Now, not only was Nagel an upstanding member of the local church,

257
00:13:11,675 --> 00:13:14,430
He also owned quite a bit of real estate in royal,

258
00:13:14,465 --> 00:13:15,665
Including the movie theater.

259
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,805
Windy kennedy was killed at the movie theater.

260
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,020
She was a single mom.
She worked a double shift at the local discount store.

261
00:13:21,055 --> 00:13:24,250
And she still managed to find time to volunteer
 at the rec center.

262
00:13:24,285 --> 00:13:26,830
I also have a third-Grade teacher,
 third cousins,

263
00:13:26,865 --> 00:13:28,405
And at least 3 potential affairs.

264
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,680
You're gonna have to start weeding
 out some of these, Garcia.

265
00:13:30,715 --> 00:13:32,630
Third cousins and religious affiliations

266
00:13:32,665 --> 00:13:34,072
Are probably not gonna help us.

267
00:13:34,107 --> 00:13:35,533
I need to know who had enemies,

268
00:13:35,568 --> 00:13:36,960
Who had secrets, who was a target.

269
00:13:36,995 --> 00:13:38,415
Oh, with all due respect, sir,

270
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:41,870
My brain muscles are comfortable
with being intuitive with information,

271
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:44,100
Not people. Looking at people like that

272
00:13:44,135 --> 00:13:45,630
Is not part of my job description.

273
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:46,895
I'm not a profiler.

274
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:49,000
Well, you're gonna have to be.
 We don't have much time.

275
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,050
You two look into the nuisance fires.

276
00:13:51,085 --> 00:13:52,250
Garcia, stay on the radio.

277
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:57,180
"Yea, though i walk through the valley

278
00:13:57,215 --> 00:13:58,600
"Of the shadow of death,

279
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:02,020
I will fear no evil,

280
00:14:02,055 --> 00:14:04,385
For thou art with me. "

281
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,650
You said large gatherings aren't a good idea,

282
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,710
Is not a target. But this service...

283
00:14:08,745 --> 00:14:10,450
The unsub wouldn't want to interrupt

284
00:14:10,485 --> 00:14:12,320
The grief he created.

285
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,200
But he may want to watch it.

286
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:17,500
We're looking for inappropriate behavior for the situation.

287
00:14:17,535 --> 00:14:19,570
Too much emotion, too little emotion.

288
00:14:19,605 --> 00:14:21,332
Someone who keeps to himself.

289
00:14:21,367 --> 00:14:23,060
Watching others' reactions.

290
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:25,410
Someone who insinuates himself too closely

291
00:14:25,445 --> 00:14:26,985
Into someone else's grief.

292
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,380
We're focusing on known offenders

293
00:14:28,415 --> 00:14:29,960
With a propensity for arson.

294
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,235
Brian Miller, 18 years old,

295
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,720
And he's been vandalizing property for almost all 18 of them.

296
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,330
"... Staff, they comfort me... "

297
00:14:38,365 --> 00:14:39,855
John Clayton, 27.

298
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:41,465
He set fire to his neighbor's garage,

299
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,150
Claimed it was an accident,
but he filed a complaint the previous month

300
00:14:44,185 --> 00:14:45,772
That the neighbor killed his dog.

301
00:14:45,807 --> 00:14:47,360
"Thou anointest my head with oil... "

302
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:52,080
"My cup runneth over.

303
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,055
"Surely goodness and mercy

304
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:59,830
"Shall follow me all the days of my life...

305
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:05,470
And i will dwell in the house of the lord forever.

306
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:06,730
Yeah, JJ.

307
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,945
People, please.

308
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,010
Calm down.

309
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,980
I'm sure it's nothing.

310
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:17,570
Thanks.

311
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,590
He's not here.

312
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:48,665
This doesn't make sense.
 He should have been at the memorial.

313
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,240
He shouldn't have been able to resist
 seeing the damage he'd done.

314
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,060
Captain.

315
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:03,460
Hey, captain.

316
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,370
Can i get a word?

317
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:07,850
It started in the kitchen.

318
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,320
Looks like he came around to the back

319
00:16:10,355 --> 00:16:11,910
And tossed a cocktail through the window.

320
00:16:11,945 --> 00:16:13,165
Different delivery system.

321
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,250
That's a big deviance from his m. O.

322
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,400
But perfect for this location.

323
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,365
I don't know,though. With a space this small

324
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,900
He shouldn't have been able to pour the gasoline
without being noticed.

325
00:16:21,935 --> 00:16:23,390
Nobody saw a thing?

326
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:26,270
Witnesses say they heard an explosion.

327
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,510
Well, i guarantee he stuck around to watch.

328
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,530
Boom.

329
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,720
The bar matches his previous locations.

330
00:16:35,755 --> 00:16:37,177
It's another local hot spot.

331
00:16:37,212 --> 00:16:38,696
Only 5 victims this time.

332
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:40,180
Why lower the body count?

333
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:41,400
Rossi.

334
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,110
There's something else that's different.

335
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,100
The front and back?

336
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,870
He really wanted to make sure nobody got out this time.

337
00:16:49,905 --> 00:16:51,932
But why bother? No one made it out of the other ones.

338
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,960
Maybe he knew the fire department would show up sooner.

339
00:16:53,995 --> 00:16:55,337
Yeah, we're faster now.

340
00:16:55,372 --> 00:16:56,645
Practice makes perfect.

341
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,500
What the hell difference does it make?

342
00:16:58,535 --> 00:17:00,285
And what good are you guys doing us?

343
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,680
You see chains, figure he didn't want anyone to get out.

344
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,820
I could have told you that.

345
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,900
We're not criticizing anyone.

346
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,025
Our job is to look at the same things you do

347
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,930
But to try to see them from a different perspective.

348
00:17:11,965 --> 00:17:12,725
Sure.

349
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,075
Look, all due respect, captain,

350
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:15,730
But you look at that chain and you say the killer

351
00:17:15,765 --> 00:17:17,570
Wanted to make sure nobody got out, right?

352
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,900
We look at that chain and we see a little more.

353
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,690
That chain is different than the first two fires.

354
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:25,505
Now, either we're looking at an entirely new arsonist

355
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:28,520
Or this unsub wanted to make absolutely certain nobody got out.

356
00:17:28,555 --> 00:17:30,590
Now, if this is true, that means something changed.

357
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,530
Maybe his emotions changed. Maybe his agenda.

358
00:17:32,565 --> 00:17:33,450
But something.

359
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,125
See, this chain tells us

360
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,130
This is the fire that matters.

361
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:39,710
This fire is gonna help us catch this guy.

362
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,420
My father was chief here for over 30 years.

363
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,110
Last 2 weeks i lost more folks that he did in his whole career.

364
00:17:51,145 --> 00:17:52,260
Agent prentiss?

365
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,165
Sorry.

366
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,255
Chief, what do we know?

367
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:58,370
4 dead. The bartender nancy is still hanging on.

368
00:17:58,405 --> 00:17:59,265
How bad is she?

369
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,770
Pretty bad. She was unconscious

370
00:18:00,805 --> 00:18:01,655
When they took her.

371
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:03,355
If we get a chance, we need to talk to her.

372
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:05,020
I was off duty. I heard it on the radio!

373
00:18:05,055 --> 00:18:06,720
God, i'm sorry, Tina.

374
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,170
I just talked to him on the phone.

375
00:18:09,205 --> 00:18:11,085
He said he was coming home.

376
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,620
Tina's fiance jason owned the bar.

377
00:18:13,655 --> 00:18:16,120
He was inside when it all happened.

378
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,490
When's it gonna stop?

379
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,135
Anything?

380
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,780
We got a completely different m. O.

381
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,605
Assuming it's not a copycat,

382
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,985
We know why the unsub wasn't at the funeral.

383
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,180
Someone in that bar was more important to him than anything else.

384
00:18:31,215 --> 00:18:32,850
Morgan, call Garcia. Tell her we need to know

385
00:18:32,885 --> 00:18:34,505
Absolutely everything there is to know

386
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,465
About these 5 victims and we need to know it now.

387
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,200
I'll go tell chief carlson we want to talk to his officers.

388
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:46,605
Hello?

389
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,745
Hey, how's miss smart and sexy doing today?

390
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,815
Fair warning, cupcake. As much as i love you

391
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:54,500
And our witty banter, i am all out of witty and banter

392
00:18:54,535 --> 00:18:56,690
And am struggling with love.

393
00:18:56,725 --> 00:18:57,485
What's wrong, baby?

394
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,700
I am standing at the crossroads of 31 lives

395
00:18:59,735 --> 00:19:01,260
And what i see is a train wreck.

396
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,440
You want a little tour? This is what i mean. Here we go.

397
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,725
Flip phillips-

398
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,905
He beat his wife. It went on for years.

399
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,940
Although you wouldn't know it if you looked at the police reports,

400
00:19:08,975 --> 00:19:11,270
Because that's one of the perks of being the mayor.

401
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,170
David Alexander
He sued his boss for $5 million

402
00:19:15,205 --> 00:19:17,035
Over something totally lame,

403
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,705
And what makes it even more erotic

404
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,540
Is he was sleeping with the boss' daughter.

405
00:19:20,575 --> 00:19:22,337
And then there is- Where is she?

406
00:19:22,372 --> 00:19:24,296
Oh! One of the town councilwomen,

407
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:26,185
Now, she had a terminally ill husband

408
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,860
And also 3 boyfriends under the age of 20.

409
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:31,470
I want to believe that the world

410
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:33,035
Is just teeming with awesome people,

411
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:35,570
But all of this is giving me great pause.

412
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:37,725
I want to go back to cyberspace.

413
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,075
I'm sorry, sweetheart, not yet.

414
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,390
I got a few more names for you.

415
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,930
Ok.

416
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,250
Just, um...

417
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,425
Please tell me they're still alive.

418
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,020
I wish i could do that, Garcia.

419
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,035
All of the first 4 fires- The convenience store,

420
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,200
The restaurant, the rec center,
 and the movie theater,

421
00:20:04,235 --> 00:20:06,392
Are indicative of a revenge arsonist.

422
00:20:06,427 --> 00:20:08,733
That's someone who's seeking retaliation

423
00:20:08,768 --> 00:20:11,040
For an injustice, whether real or imagined.

424
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:14,520
Revenge arsonists often target group headquarters,

425
00:20:14,555 --> 00:20:16,812
Such as churches or government buildings.

426
00:20:16,847 --> 00:20:19,233
This unsub has chosen local gathering places

427
00:20:19,268 --> 00:20:21,585
With large numbers of potential victims inside.

428
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,220
It's clear to us that he's chosen to target
this community as a whole.

429
00:20:24,255 --> 00:20:26,412
That tells us that the unsub is a local,

430
00:20:26,447 --> 00:20:28,570
Someone who lives or grew up in royal.

431
00:20:28,605 --> 00:20:30,630
But he feels like an outsider.

432
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,090
As if this community has wronged him
in some type of way.

433
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:34,840
These fires are just his way of striking back,

434
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,365
Trying to draw attention to himself.

435
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,565
These fires not only killed innocent people,

436
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,350
They also gave the unsub
 a sense of power over the community.

437
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:48,115
But somehow those fires were lacking.

438
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,920
They didn't exact the correct measure of punishment

439
00:20:50,955 --> 00:20:52,145
Or attract enough attention.

440
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,450
Or they didn't attract the attention of the right person.

441
00:20:54,485 --> 00:20:55,775
So with the bar fire,

442
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:58,060
He didn't increase the number of victims.

443
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,500
He reduced them.

444
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:10,235
That's why the third fire is key.

445
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,830
He's not striking out at the community
 as a whole anymore.

446
00:21:12,865 --> 00:21:15,640
He's now striking out at one or more individuals.

447
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,495
You're sure it's the same guy?

448
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,950
The odds of another arsonist in a town this small

449
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:27,295
Are almost negligible.

450
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:29,020
That's why we need to concentrate on these victims.

451
00:21:29,055 --> 00:21:30,505
These 5 will hold the key.

452
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,020
So all we gotta do is just figure out

453
00:21:32,055 --> 00:21:33,500
Who would have wanted to hurt them.

454
00:21:33,535 --> 00:21:34,795
It may not be that simple.

455
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:37,880
This type of rage tends to stem from things
 that people keep buried.

456
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,925
Things they just don't talk about.

457
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,550
Which is why we're gonna have to dig deeply.

458
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,760
Understood.

459
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,480
Excuse me.

460
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,490
How is she?

461
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,950
We couldn't even send her to the burn unit in gary.

462
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,090
It wouldn't have mattered.

463
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:01,970
We'll be brief.

464
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:11,170
Nancy.

465
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,090
It's me.

466
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,225
The FBI is here.

467
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,910
Nancy, can you tell us what happened?

468
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,940
There was a crash...

469
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,100
Then everything exploded.

470
00:22:23,135 --> 00:22:24,020
Cocktail.

471
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,280
What happened before that?

472
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:31,140
Was there anything unusual or out of the ordinary?

473
00:22:31,175 --> 00:22:34,140
Did anyone come in or leave?

474
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:37,610
Just jason.

475
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,440
Jason, the owner?

476
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:43,000
He came for the money.

477
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:45,440
Like always.

478
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,510
He's dead, isn't he?

479
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,670
Nancy, what about customers?

480
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:54,140
Was there anyone there who seemed anxious or upset?

481
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:57,055
He would have kept to himself,

482
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:59,455
Taken a seat away from the other customers.

483
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:02,090
Maybe he was checking his watch or his cell phone.

484
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:03,930
There was a guy...

485
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:05,945
He seemed angry.

486
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,940
He kept changing seats.

487
00:23:07,975 --> 00:23:09,865
Ok. We have to stop.

488
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,970
Who was that, Nancy? You know his name?

489
00:23:12,005 --> 00:23:13,250
Now.

490
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,455
So tell us about the bar victims.

491
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:38,505
All right. Hilda and roger drake.

492
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,520
She was a teacher, he sold insurance.

493
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,755
Friends, enemies?

494
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,845
Oh, no, nothing like that. They seemed sweet.

495
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,530
Their biggest problem was finding baby names.
 Hilda was pregnant.

496
00:23:46,565 --> 00:23:47,695
Are you sure?

497
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:49,530
The m. E. Hasn't even started yet.

498
00:23:49,565 --> 00:23:51,307
No, people in royal take out ads.

499
00:23:51,342 --> 00:23:53,015
"Lordy, lordy, looks who's 40."

500
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:56,010
"Ask jane what she was doing
 at the american legion on friday night. "

501
00:23:56,045 --> 00:23:57,265
That's just wrong.

502
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,885
That's small-Town life for you.

503
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,660
Your business is everybody's business.

504
00:24:00,695 --> 00:24:02,100
There was a belly watch on hilda.

505
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:05,520
Uh, what about eric gall?

506
00:24:05,555 --> 00:24:07,235
Oh, eric. He was a boozer.

507
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:09,595
He spent most of his time at pop's place.

508
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:12,270
I've got a few drunk and disorderlies,
 but he seems harmless.

509
00:24:12,305 --> 00:24:13,947
And given the amount of rounds he bought,

510
00:24:13,982 --> 00:24:15,590
It's safe to say the whole town love him.

511
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:16,560
It's hotch.

512
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,850
Yeah, what's up?

513
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:22,845
Ok.

514
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,740
I got it.

515
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,915
Ok, well, they managed to speak to the bartender.

516
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:28,125
According to her, there was a guy there before the fire.

517
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,300
He didn't speak to anybody and he kept switching seats.

518
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:33,217
She didn't seem to recognize him.

519
00:24:33,252 --> 00:24:36,100
Ok. Wait. So she knew the owner

520
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,475
And the boozer,

521
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,840
And the husband wouldn't have gotten up and changed seats.

522
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:41,450
If the bartender didn't recognize him,

523
00:24:41,485 --> 00:24:42,882
Maybe he's just not from royal.

524
00:24:42,917 --> 00:24:44,245
That's not necessarily true.

525
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,590
What if she knew him and she just didn't realize it?

526
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:47,535
What, like a disguise?

527
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:49,615
The fire captain said the unsub knew the layout

528
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,780
Of the movie theater.
 He used that knowledge to light the fire.

529
00:24:51,815 --> 00:24:54,380
But at the bar, the unsub kept changing his seats.

530
00:24:54,415 --> 00:24:55,870
Which would give him a better view

531
00:24:55,905 --> 00:24:57,707
Of the entrances and exits.

532
00:24:57,742 --> 00:24:59,376
So he was studying the layout.

533
00:24:59,411 --> 00:25:01,010
He wasn't familiar with the area.

534
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:05,310
What if he grew up in royal and he moved away?

535
00:25:05,345 --> 00:25:08,867
Garcia, what year was that bar built?

536
00:25:08,902 --> 00:25:12,390
Uh,the bar was built 5... 6 years ago.

537
00:25:12,425 --> 00:25:13,805
And what about the movie theater?

538
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,315
The movie theater was built in the forties.

539
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,820
It was a single screen, they divided it 2 years ago.

540
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:20,090
Rec center was built in the late seventies.

541
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:21,090
I'm gonna call hotch.

542
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,330
Jason elliot opened pop's place 6 years ago

543
00:25:37,365 --> 00:25:39,087
When he moved to royal from indianapolis.

544
00:25:39,122 --> 00:25:40,810
Why? Does he have friends or family here?

545
00:25:40,845 --> 00:25:41,905
None that i could find.

546
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,285
What about the bar? Did jason buy it

547
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,630
From someone, take over their business?

548
00:25:44,665 --> 00:25:46,240
No. Jason started the bar himself.

549
00:25:46,275 --> 00:25:47,695
He named it after his father,

550
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:49,380
Who, by the way, was his sole beneficiary.

551
00:25:49,415 --> 00:25:50,605
Makes sense. He was single.

552
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,620
Well, he was single, up until a couple days ago,

553
00:25:52,655 --> 00:25:55,180
Because 2 days ago, jason married...

554
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:56,900
Tina wheeler.

555
00:25:56,935 --> 00:25:58,185
The emt.

556
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,695
Yeah. I had checked her out originally

557
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:02,530
As one of the first responders,
but her work records looked squeaky clean,

558
00:26:02,565 --> 00:26:05,080
And so i let it go until i realized she'd married Jason,

559
00:26:05,115 --> 00:26:06,862
And then i did some more aggressive digging,

560
00:26:06,897 --> 00:26:08,575
Which i should remind you you asked me to do,

561
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:12,560
And it turns out that Tina's parents died in a fire when she was 5.

562
00:26:12,595 --> 00:26:15,355
After they died, her and her brother Tommy

563
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:17,650
Were sent to live with their grandparents in royal.

564
00:26:17,685 --> 00:26:19,050
Send us everything you have on them.

565
00:26:19,085 --> 00:26:20,770
Well, that's just it. I got...

566
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:23,515
I got plenty on Tina,

567
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:26,080
But i can't really find anything on her brother.

568
00:26:26,115 --> 00:26:28,665
Tina, she, uh, she lived in royal,

569
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,020
She went to a community college a few towns over,

570
00:26:31,055 --> 00:26:32,527
Got a degree, took a job,

571
00:26:32,562 --> 00:26:34,000
Worked hard, married jason-

572
00:26:34,035 --> 00:26:35,570
Uh... wait...

573
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:37,145
Tommy, it's like...

574
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,515
He just disappeared.

575
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,850
Find him, Garcia.

576
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,410
Lana perry, please.

577
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,450
Hi. This is penelope Garcia of the fbi.

578
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,910
I wanted to ask you some questions.

579
00:27:43,945 --> 00:27:45,110
You have a second?

580
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:48,680
Yes. I-I wanted to ask you some questions

581
00:27:48,715 --> 00:27:51,660
About a student, uh, named Tommy wheeler.

582
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,325
Thank you.

583
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,750
Thank you very much.

584
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,880
Oh, my god.

585
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:12,160
Sir, i think i have something.

586
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:15,760
We believe jason elliot may have been the target.

587
00:28:15,795 --> 00:28:16,425
Jason.

588
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,235
The bartender said that jason stopped by the bar

589
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:21,210
At the same time each day to pick up the cash
and take it to the bank.

590
00:28:21,245 --> 00:28:24,150
Which would have made him 
an easy target for anyone who knew his schedule.

591
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:26,315
I don't get all this.

592
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,640
Jason was a good man.

593
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,720
It may sound corny to you,

594
00:28:29,755 --> 00:28:31,215
But everybody loved him.

595
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:34,280
2 days ago, Jason elliot married Tina wheeler.

596
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:36,140
She told me about it yesterday. Uh...

597
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:39,470
All the tragedies made them not want to wait.

598
00:28:39,505 --> 00:28:40,825
It's a damn shame.

599
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,990
What can you tell us about Tina's brother Tommy?

600
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,650
Tommy?

601
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:51,350
Uh, nobody's seen him around here in more than 10 years.

602
00:28:51,385 --> 00:28:53,117
Uh, we actually think they may have.

603
00:28:53,152 --> 00:28:54,850
They just might not recognize him.

604
00:28:54,885 --> 00:28:56,032
How is that possible?

605
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,145
Well, he's aged 10 years,

606
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,990
And he'd make sure to go unnoticed.

607
00:28:59,025 --> 00:28:59,775
Garcia?

608
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:01,090
Tommy wheeler.

609
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,315
Little Tommy wheeler. You remember him?

610
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:07,110
He and his sister Tina moved to royal when he was 5.

611
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:09,055
Doc rawlings was his pediatrician.

612
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:10,930
Apparently early medical records indicated

613
00:29:10,965 --> 00:29:12,770
Tommy may have been emotionally unbalanced.

614
00:29:12,805 --> 00:29:14,290
Tommy was a little unstable.

615
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:16,310
His parents dying brought that out.

616
00:29:16,345 --> 00:29:18,035
Granted,i don't have a medical degree,

617
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:21,430
But my guess is, watching his parents die in a fire

618
00:29:21,465 --> 00:29:23,365
Didn't help Tommy's emotional well-Being.

619
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:27,160
What about Tina? How did the fires affect her?

620
00:29:27,195 --> 00:29:30,920
Uh... Tina wasn't as damaged by it as he was.

621
00:29:30,955 --> 00:29:32,172
Uh, she adjusted more quickly.

622
00:29:32,207 --> 00:29:33,355
She was Tommy's lifeline.

623
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:35,700
She was more than that.
In a situation like this

624
00:29:35,735 --> 00:29:37,235
No parents, new environment,

625
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:40,120
And grandparents probably too old
to take care of them,

626
00:29:40,155 --> 00:29:42,140
Tina became Tommy's whole world.

627
00:29:42,175 --> 00:29:43,807
Sister, mother, family.

628
00:29:43,842 --> 00:29:45,405
They were very close.

629
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,210
Close enough that Tina distorted Tommy's love map.

630
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:50,980
The way an individual gives or receives love-

631
00:29:51,015 --> 00:29:52,135
Their love map-

632
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:54,810
Is established by the age of 6.

633
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:56,335
With the death of the parents,

634
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:59,130
Tommy's love map revolved exclusively around Tina.

635
00:29:59,165 --> 00:30:01,855
Yeah, it was like they were in their own little world.

636
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:03,850
By the time they were 8,
they even had their own language.

637
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:05,755
It was a bit disturbing.

638
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:08,150
But understandable. Perfectly understandable.

639
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:09,725
Maybe.

640
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,615
So what happened?

641
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:12,140
What do you think happened? People talked.

642
00:30:12,175 --> 00:30:13,630
It's the only real occupation in royal.

643
00:30:13,665 --> 00:30:14,840
There were rumors.

644
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:17,690
It was that Tommy and Tina were too close.

645
00:30:17,725 --> 00:30:18,685
Tommy wheeler!

646
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,750
My god, that's your sister!

647
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,215
Nothing was ever confirmed,though.

648
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:26,300
No, it wasn't.
But, then, the truth didn't matter.

649
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:28,720
After the rumors started,

650
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,190
Things got ugly.

651
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:31,655
People pointed fingers,

652
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:33,215
Tommy got expelled from school.

653
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:34,850
Based on nothing but hearsay.

654
00:30:34,885 --> 00:30:36,450
Not true. The school had cause.

655
00:30:36,485 --> 00:30:37,445
Garcia- No, they didn't.

656
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,900
I spoke to his teacher.
She told me how the whole school and the whole town

657
00:30:40,935 --> 00:30:42,780
Turned against him, based on nothing but a rumor.

658
00:30:42,815 --> 00:30:44,405
She also told me another rumor. Garcia-

659
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,450
In this one, 14-Year-Old Tommy
was beaten within an inch of his life

660
00:30:47,485 --> 00:30:49,450
By adults. Grown men.

661
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:52,560
I didn't hear about it until after the fact.

662
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:53,985
There was nothing i could do.

663
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,985
Broken bones, punctured lung.
 All because of a rumor.

664
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:59,950
I couldn't go after anyone based
 on only my suspicions.

665
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:02,390
Nobody was talking about it,

666
00:31:02,425 --> 00:31:03,790
Not even Tommy.

667
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:05,515
I spoke to his grandparents

668
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:06,995
And told them what to do.

669
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,405
Yeah. So they moved Tommy

670
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,695
To a colorado boarding school,

671
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:11,850
And they cut off all ties between him 
and his sister.

672
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,090
It was as if Tommy never even existed.

673
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,270
It was for the best.

674
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:17,990
They would have killed him.

675
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:21,540
If what Garcia said is true,
then this town's actions

676
00:31:21,575 --> 00:31:24,290
Went a long way towards making Tommy who he is.

677
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:29,450
We need to talk to Tina.

678
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,350
Go on around, take the back.

679
00:31:44,385 --> 00:31:45,170
Yes, sir.

680
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,200
Tina!

681
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:53,720
It's me, Brad!

682
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,800
Tina?

683
00:31: 58,760 --> 00:32:01,040
Morgan,find out if Tina showed up for work today.

684
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,550
Tina?

685
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,010
Tina?

686
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,220
Tina?

687
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:17,930
Clear!

688
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:22,950
Nobody's here.

689
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:27,380
Yeah, Morgan.

690
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,600
Tina didn't show up for her shift.
Thanks.

691
00:32:30,635 --> 00:32:32,070
She left her cell phone.

692
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:34,430
You think it was Tommy?

693
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,780
Yes?

694
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,430
Tommy?

695
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,850
Put out an apb for Tommy and Tina.

696
00:32:43,885 --> 00:32:45,540
Close all roads in and out of royal.

697
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:48,020
No, no, he loves her.

698
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,110
He wouldn't hurt her.

699
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,035
According to his former teacher,

700
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:59,780
Tommy wheeler enrolled 
in a colorado boarding school

701
00:32:59,815 --> 00:33:01,145
Under the name thomas boren.

702
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,610
That's his dead mother's maiden name.

703
00:33:02,645 --> 00:33:04,585
I tracked down his records.

704
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:08,400
He was at that school for half a year
before he landed in juvie,

705
00:33:08,435 --> 00:33:09,875
Where he resided for the next 3.

706
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:12,480
His psych evals during his stay
were less than stellar.

707
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,245
So how mad do you think he is?

708
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,030
Well, if i was him i'd be pretty mad.

709
00:33:17,065 --> 00:33:17,755
Oh, god.

710
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,980
Garcia, the town did turn against him.

711
00:33:20,015 --> 00:33:21,370
I mean, that's not an excuse.

712
00:33:21,405 --> 00:33:23,510
No, not Tommy. Hotch.

713
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,375
I mean, he did tell me to dig, right? So i dug.

714
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:29,400
And, granted, i'm not supposed to have
Direct contact with the public

715
00:33:29,435 --> 00:33:31,600
Or purport myself as an fbi agent.

716
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:33,755
And-Ok,i'm definitely

717
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:35,370
Not supposed to accuse someone of a felony

718
00:33:35,405 --> 00:33:36,475
Or even a misdemeanor,

719
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:38,590
Especially when i don't have any actual evidence.

720
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,420
Oh, god.

721
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:42,265
I did just what they did.

722
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,215
I- I based everything on a rumor.

723
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:46,210
I got sucked right in. I didn't mean to. I-

724
00:33:46,245 --> 00:33:48,580
Garcia, come on, baby. Stick to Tommy.

725
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:49,920
Right.

726
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,000
Sorry.

727
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:52,590
Ok, uh...

728
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,825
He was released from juvie when he was 16.

729
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,965
You couldn't find him?
That's when the trail goes cold.

730
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,070
No, i said the trail went cold,
I didn't say it disappeared.

731
00:33:59,105 --> 00:34:00,760
This is the part i'm actually good at.

732
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,760
Whatever he did in the interim remains a mystery,

733
00:34:02,795 --> 00:34:05,292
Much to my chagrin, but at the age of 21,

734
00:34:05,327 --> 00:34:07,790
Thomas boren re-Emerged in Franklin, Indiana.

735
00:34:07,825 --> 00:34:09,485
That's 300 miles away from royal.

736
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,950
Said mr. Boren purchased copious amounts of gasoline

737
00:34:11,985 --> 00:34:14,657
2 months ago. It's not unusual to do in indiana,

738
00:34:14,692 --> 00:34:17,330
But mr. Tommy wheeler/boren didn't own a farm.

739
00:34:17,365 --> 00:34:18,355
The nuisance fires.

740
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,840
Roger that. And then after his little spending spree,

741
00:34:20,875 --> 00:34:23,290
That's when the trail goes cold and i can't find him.

742
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,700
Yeah, hotch.

743
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:28,360
All right.

744
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,480
There's still no sign of Tina.

745
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:32,770
He wants you to bring rawlings.

746
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,990
We've locked down the town

747
00:34:39,025 --> 00:34:40,280
And put out a statewide alert.

748
00:34:40,315 --> 00:34:41,685
So far, nothing.

749
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,720
Where in royal would Tommy take his sister?

750
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:44,990
It's hard to say.

751
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:47,450
It's likely to be a place
That's important to the both of them.

752
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:49,400
Maybe a place that they went to together as kids.

753
00:34:49,435 --> 00:34:51,130
I don't know. The only place i can think of

754
00:34:51,165 --> 00:34:53,047
Is their grandparents' old house,

755
00:34:53,082 --> 00:34:54,930
But that was torn down years ago.

756
00:34:54,965 --> 00:34:56,045
That's not gonna help us.

757
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,670
I've got pictures of her 
With the grandparents and friends.

758
00:34:58,705 --> 00:34:59,707
Nothing with Tommy.

759
00:34:59,742 --> 00:35:00,710
Garcia was right.

760
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:04,120
After he was sent away, 
Tommy no longer existed,

761
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:05,925
Not even as a memory.

762
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,220
Tommy, please, what are we doing here?

763
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:31,730
I found toy.

764
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:33,800
Or what she had left of him.

765
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,460
You mean everything to me.

766
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,885
Everything.

767
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,590
You and i, we're
We're soul mates.

768
00:35:43,625 --> 00:35:44,515
Tommy.

769
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:45,940
They can't keep us apart anymore.

770
00:35:45,975 --> 00:35:47,030
That's your sister!

771
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,300
They?

772
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,390
Get off of her right now.

773
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,200
My god, Tommy.

774
00:35:58,130 --> 00:35:59,565
All those... people-

775
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,000
You killed them?

776
00:36:02,845 --> 00:36:02,845
For you. For us. So we can be together.

777
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,080
Don't you see that
That's how it was meant to be.

778
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,760
Just the two of us.

779
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,045
You killed jason?

780
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,810
Don't say his name! Don't!

781
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:18,460
Hotch, i think we have something here.

782
00:36:18,495 --> 00:36:19,790
What dance is this?

783
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,855
The, uh, spring formal.

784
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,980
They hold it every year at the community center.

785
00:36:25,015 --> 00:36:27,070
May of '98. This was just before Tommy was beaten

786
00:36:27,105 --> 00:36:28,500
And forced out of town.

787
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:32,860
Is this dance something Tommy and Tina 
would have gone to?

788
00:36:32,895 --> 00:36:34,245
It's a big event.

789
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,790
All the kids go even if they don't have formal dates.

790
00:36:36,825 --> 00:36:37,960
So they could have gone together?

791
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:39,240
Absolutely.

792
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:47,780
I need you to remember.

793
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:56,620
Tommy, don't. Don't do this.

794
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:58,740
We were together.

795
00:36:59,440 --> 00:36:59,945
We were happy.

796
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:02,650
Tommy, stop it! Please stop it!

797
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,660
You have to turn yourself in.

798
00:37:04,695 --> 00:37:05,800
Remember!

799
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,800
I remember.

800
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:14,010
It can be like this again.

801
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:16,510
We can be together, ok? Just like this.

802
00:37:16,545 --> 00:37:18,635
No. We can't, Tommy.

803
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,500
We can't! It isn't right!

804
00:37:20,535 --> 00:37:21,440
It is!

805
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,920
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be all right. I promise.

806
00:37:27,955 --> 00:37:29,482
You belong with me.

807
00:37:29,517 --> 00:37:31,010
No, i don't! No, i don't!

808
00:37:31,045 --> 00:37:32,137
Please! Let me go!

809
00:37:32,172 --> 00:37:33,230
Tommy, let her go!

810
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,800
Let her go, son!

811
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:37,070
Let her go!

812
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:38,280
No.

813
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,535
I'll burn the whole town down.

814
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:52,590
No, you won't. Not if you love her.

815
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:59,710
Look at her, Tommy. Look at her.

816
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,770
If you really love her, then let her go.

817
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,145
Please, Tommy.

818
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,610
You don't want to hurt her, son.

819
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:32,450
I... love you.

820
00:38:32,485 --> 00:38:33,720
I know.

821
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,030
"I have loved to the point of madness.

822
00:38:53,065 --> 00:38:54,960
"That which is called madness.

823
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,370
That which to me is the only sensible way to love. "

824
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,550
Francoise sagan.

825
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:13,310
You guys choose this...

826
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,465
Turning people over like rocks

827
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:18,070
And looking at all their
Creepy crawly things underneath.

828
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,085
And i get it. I do.

829
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,520
It's the only way to catch them. But...

830
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,840
I want to see the good in people.

831
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:26,370
I choose to see the good in people.

832
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:28,435
And... getting into someone's mind

833
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:29,940
And trying to find the god
Awful thing that happened to them

834
00:39:29,975 --> 00:39:32,480
That made them do the god
Awful thing to somebody else

835
00:39:32,515 --> 00:39:35,725
Has seriously impaired my ability to giggle,

836
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,240
And it makes my brain all wonky,
And i don't like it.

837
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,645
Garcia.

838
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,530
Yes, sir.

839
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:47,075
I just wanted to thank you

840
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:48,775
For your excellent work on this case.

841
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:50,440
And i understand that what you did

842
00:39:50,475 --> 00:39:52,490
Was for you very difficult.

843
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,570
But your contributions are essential

844
00:39:55,605 --> 00:39:57,060
To the success of this team.

845
00:39:57,095 --> 00:39:58,195
Thank you, sir.

846
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:00,340
I know you see the good in people, Penelope.

847
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,640
Always.

848
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:06,390
And i would never want you to change that.

9999
