1
00:00:01,762 --> 00:00:03,305
<i>Chopper one, we have a report</i>

2
00:00:03,347 --> 00:00:04,997
<i>of a body in Presidio park.</i>

3
00:00:05,728 --> 00:00:07,643
<i>Chopper one, copy. En route.</i>

4
00:00:23,094 --> 00:00:24,870
Confirming dead body male,

5
00:00:24,912 --> 00:00:27,962
mid-30s, badly beaten,
single gunshot to the head.

6
00:00:31,996 --> 00:00:33,032
Well?

7
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:36,863
We need to call the FBI.

8
00:00:38,169 --> 00:00:39,539
It's starting again.

9
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:48,658
You hungry?
You want to grab something?

10
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:50,940
Don't try and act like you care.

11
00:00:51,037 --> 00:00:53,168
I just want to know
if you're hungry.

12
00:00:53,377 --> 00:00:54,898
No, I'm not hungry.

13
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,016
I'm not the enemy, Jane.

14
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:02,279
Of course not.
My friends are, right?

15
00:01:02,321 --> 00:01:03,354
And David.

16
00:01:03,881 --> 00:01:05,018
You're 14.

17
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,538
It's too young to go on dates,

18
00:01:07,736 --> 00:01:10,020
especially with a boy
who's already driving.

19
00:01:10,848 --> 00:01:13,035
Mom thinks you work too much.

20
00:01:13,182 --> 00:01:15,096
What does that have
to do with anything?

21
00:01:15,138 --> 00:01:17,136
It's not my fault
that you two don't get along.

22
00:01:17,178 --> 00:01:18,726
I'm not saying it is.

23
00:01:19,587 --> 00:01:21,409
You're trying to shit me off.

24
00:01:22,061 --> 00:01:23,675
Your mom and I love you.

25
00:01:24,036 --> 00:01:25,246
Don't even.

26
00:01:27,207 --> 00:01:28,229
Ok.

27
00:01:28,611 --> 00:01:30,972
You want to be treated
like an adult, fine.

28
00:01:31,205 --> 00:01:33,301
Let's have an adult conversation.

29
00:01:35,441 --> 00:01:37,434
Can I help you?

30
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,547
What do you think's going on
with the helicopters tonight?

31
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:44,812
I'm sorry, I'm trying to have
a conversation with my daughter.

32
00:01:48,345 --> 00:01:50,132
I wasn't talking to you.

33
00:01:51,823 --> 00:01:53,112
I was talking to Jane.

34
00:01:56,031 --> 00:01:58,785
- How do you know my daughter's name?
- You're not in charge here.

35
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:01,256
Jane.

36
00:02:01,404 --> 00:02:03,059
- Run ahead.
- No!

37
00:02:05,982 --> 00:02:07,418
Now, you come quiet.

38
00:02:09,408 --> 00:02:10,630
Or you both die.

39
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:50,702
Hotch.

40
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,879
Cooper.

41
00:02:55,235 --> 00:02:57,051
You never were one for offices.

42
00:02:59,578 --> 00:03:00,931
A medical condition.

43
00:03:01,037 --> 00:03:02,598
I'm allergic to bureaucracy.

44
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,866
- Thanks for coming, Hotch.
- Sure. I don't have long.

45
00:03:05,908 --> 00:03:08,475
- We're leaving on a case.
- I know. San Francisco.

46
00:03:08,837 --> 00:03:11,090
- I hear things.
- So what's going on?

47
00:03:11,132 --> 00:03:13,296
How much you know about
this case you're working?

48
00:03:13,338 --> 00:03:15,388
I'm on my way
in to look at the files.

49
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:17,715
- Can I give you a preview?
- Sure.

50
00:03:18,472 --> 00:03:19,788
All right, so,...

51
00:03:20,173 --> 00:03:21,408
here's the deal.

52
00:03:22,112 --> 00:03:23,294
2 years ago,

53
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:24,960
a dead male

54
00:03:25,565 --> 00:03:26,956
turned up in Presidio park.

55
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,166
A massive amount
of blunt force trauma.

56
00:03:29,802 --> 00:03:31,030
Defensive wounds,

57
00:03:31,304 --> 00:03:33,372
single gunshot
to the back of the head.

58
00:03:33,898 --> 00:03:35,548
And over the next 3 days,

59
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,593
3 more vics, same M.O.,
and after that,

60
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,000
there was nothing.

61
00:03:40,567 --> 00:03:42,263
Until exactly one year later.

62
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,448
Same thing.

63
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,559
Dead male, badly beaten,
shot execution style,

64
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,103
followed by 3 more vics
over the next 3 days.

65
00:03:49,293 --> 00:03:52,106
- And then nothing until last night.
- One year later. Exactly.

66
00:03:52,255 --> 00:03:55,117
Which means we have 3 days
before the trail goes cold again.

67
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,028
Why all the interest?

68
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,498
I got a theory.

69
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:03,367
I think there are parallel murders
linked to these cases.

70
00:04:03,582 --> 00:04:06,245
2 years ago, one day after
those murders stopped,

71
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:09,373
a single dad and his
15-year-old brunette daughter

72
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,130
were found dead in their car.

73
00:04:11,457 --> 00:04:12,766
Last year...

74
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:17,297
again, one day after the dead
males stopped showing up,

75
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,246
same thing. Another dad

76
00:04:19,288 --> 00:04:21,750
- and his brunette daughter.
- And you think it's all connected?

77
00:04:21,792 --> 00:04:23,721
I think it's a hell
of a coincidence, don't you?

78
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,836
And you want me to bring
your team in on the case.

79
00:04:25,878 --> 00:04:26,983
You only have 3 days.

80
00:04:27,025 --> 00:04:29,260
I mean, you don't have time
to be chasing an angle like this one.

81
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:31,108
So my team works
the bodies in Presidio Park

82
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,568
while your team tests the theory
about the fathers and daughters.

83
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,331
And if I'm right, both halves of
the case help solve the other half.

84
00:04:36,373 --> 00:04:38,832
And you already asked
the director and she said no.

85
00:04:38,874 --> 00:04:41,461
She is not strong at
thinking outside the box.

86
00:04:41,503 --> 00:04:44,228
If you ignore her order
and you're wrong, you're done.

87
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,873
I'm telling you, Hotch...

88
00:04:46,433 --> 00:04:49,790
Right now, there's a father and there's
a daughter and they're missing,

89
00:04:50,221 --> 00:04:52,965
and no one is looking for them.

90
00:04:57,295 --> 00:04:58,389
Stop it.

91
00:04:58,871 --> 00:04:59,656
Stop it.

92
00:04:59,698 --> 00:05:01,170
If I can snap this chain...

93
00:05:01,212 --> 00:05:03,059
You're just gonna hurt yourself.

94
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,767
Stop it, please, please!

95
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,976
- Please stop it!
- You ok?

96
00:05:08,018 --> 00:05:09,093
Stop!

97
00:05:14,132 --> 00:05:15,564
You stay away from her.

98
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:19,944
I said get away from her.

99
00:05:21,482 --> 00:05:24,132
- What the hell do you want?
- It's simple.

100
00:05:26,185 --> 00:05:28,285
You give her to me,

101
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,864
you both live.

102
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,000
Go to hell.

103
00:05:35,603 --> 00:05:37,057
That's your answer.

104
00:05:51,559 --> 00:06:10,953
Criminal Team
http://experts.heberg-forum.net/

105
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:21,964
Saison 5 - Episode 18
- The Fight -

106
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,037
<i>Mother Teresa said,</i>

107
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:27,838
<i>"I have found the paradox.</i>

108
00:06:27,999 --> 00:06:30,211
<i>That if you love until it hurts,</i>

109
00:06:30,253 --> 00:06:32,039
<i>there can be no more hurt,</i>

110
00:06:32,165 --> 00:06:33,540
<i>only more love."</i>

111
00:06:35,897 --> 00:06:37,966
What do we know about
the past years' victims?

112
00:06:38,008 --> 00:06:40,044
The tenderloin district
is a high concentration

113
00:06:40,086 --> 00:06:42,814
of drug addicts and homeless people.
All the victims have been transients.

114
00:06:42,856 --> 00:06:45,326
So this unsub's choosing easy
targets that won't be missed.

115
00:06:45,368 --> 00:06:47,534
He's not concerned
with the challenge of the hunt.

116
00:06:47,576 --> 00:06:49,387
All these victims are part
of a larger plan.

117
00:06:49,429 --> 00:06:51,792
Which he executes
in the same few days every year.

118
00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:53,842
Reid did you find any
significance to the dates?

119
00:06:53,884 --> 00:06:56,365
Nothing historical.
It's got to be personal for the unsub.

120
00:06:57,031 --> 00:06:59,299
JJ, you and Reid hit
the San Francisco P.D.,

121
00:06:59,341 --> 00:07:01,388
Rossi and Prentiss to the dumpsite.

122
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,537
Morgan and I will go
to the coroner's office.

123
00:07:03,579 --> 00:07:06,590
Nobody should expect to get
a lot of sleep in the next 3 days.

124
00:07:06,632 --> 00:07:09,066
What about Cooper's team?
You said he had a theory.

125
00:07:09,108 --> 00:07:10,708
He believes
that whoever is murdering

126
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,063
these homeless men is also
abducting fathers and daughters

127
00:07:13,105 --> 00:07:15,434
and killing them once
the transients are disposed of.

128
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,355
So then we'll investigate
the dead men,

129
00:07:17,397 --> 00:07:20,272
and his team can see if there is
a missing father and daughter.

130
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:22,244
Why isn't his team on the jet now?

131
00:07:22,286 --> 00:07:25,312
Because the director wouldn't authorize
them joining the investigation.

132
00:07:25,354 --> 00:07:27,577
They're working against
the director's orders?

133
00:07:27,619 --> 00:07:30,361
We need to concentrate on the dead
men abducted from the tenderloin.

134
00:07:30,403 --> 00:07:33,053
Cooper's team can help determine
if there's a missing father and daughter

135
00:07:33,095 --> 00:07:34,945
and whether it's connected
to our case.

136
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:37,160
Or you could get
in serious hot water

137
00:07:37,202 --> 00:07:39,386
if the director thinks
you're helping to defy her.

138
00:07:39,428 --> 00:07:40,960
No, Hotch is right.

139
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,052
I've known Sam Cooper for 20 years,

140
00:07:43,094 --> 00:07:45,037
and I've never seen
him defy an order.

141
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:47,088
If he feels this
strong about a hunch,

142
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:49,519
we need to help him however we can.

143
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,426
Trying to get out
of the heavy lifting, eh?

144
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:23,939
Actually, I'm setting
up a two-way iLNB

145
00:08:23,981 --> 00:08:27,555
with a 500-megawatt transmitter
and single-polarity LNB,

146
00:08:27,597 --> 00:08:30,204
both operating in the Ku band.

147
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:35,055
What did she just say to me?

148
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,057
At least we're blessed
with a nice setup.

149
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,537
How'd you hook it up?

150
00:08:38,579 --> 00:08:41,355
I know a guy who knows a guy
who's a slumlord,

151
00:08:41,643 --> 00:08:43,120
who gave us a great deal.

152
00:08:43,162 --> 00:08:45,957
So, how do we conjure
victims of a crime

153
00:08:45,999 --> 00:08:49,412
that might not have been committed out
of thin air in a major american city?

154
00:08:49,454 --> 00:08:52,929
San Francisco has a population
of 800,000. half of those are males.

155
00:08:54,168 --> 00:08:55,772
Just start with the females.

156
00:08:55,814 --> 00:08:58,179
Only 45% of the population is white.

157
00:08:58,276 --> 00:09:00,928
- So what does that leave?
- 360,000.

158
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,917
That's gets us to 180,000.

159
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,014
Check school absences.

160
00:09:05,056 --> 00:09:08,494
Narrow that to girls 13 to 18
and narrow it again to brunettes.

161
00:09:08,834 --> 00:09:11,342
Find their fathers' names
and check their workplaces,

162
00:09:11,757 --> 00:09:14,220
- who hasn't shown up.
- Well, ok.

163
00:09:14,665 --> 00:09:16,388
If you want to show off about it.

164
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:17,474
All right.

165
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:18,582
Let's ride.

166
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,059
Let's get to work.

167
00:09:27,695 --> 00:09:30,309
Have all the dumpsites
been this isolated?

168
00:09:30,447 --> 00:09:32,432
He keeps away from the main paths.

169
00:09:32,474 --> 00:09:34,232
Never dumps them in lighted areas.

170
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:37,326
So he had to have studied the terrain
beforehand. He's organized.

171
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,761
And physical enough to haul a body
a long way on his own.

172
00:09:40,803 --> 00:09:42,793
What can you tell us
about the victims?

173
00:09:42,835 --> 00:09:44,642
They were all living on the streets.

174
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:46,235
No witnesses.

175
00:09:46,277 --> 00:09:49,255
Our guess is he managed to lure them,
promising food or drugs.

176
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:51,493
- Were any reported missing?
- No.

177
00:09:51,535 --> 00:09:54,301
We do know they all came from the same
few blocks in the tenderloin.

178
00:09:57,215 --> 00:09:59,451
This is the body they
found at presidio park.

179
00:09:59,571 --> 00:10:02,321
If he hadn't been shot, he probably
would have died of internal bleeding.

180
00:10:02,441 --> 00:10:04,858
It looks like he landed
a few shots of his own.

181
00:10:06,085 --> 00:10:07,939
There's powder
residue on his skull.

182
00:10:08,594 --> 00:10:10,602
He had to have been
subdued when he was shot.

183
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,156
So he gets abducted off the street
quietly enough that

184
00:10:14,204 --> 00:10:15,330
there's no witnesses,

185
00:10:15,374 --> 00:10:17,545
But then he fights for his
life only to let the unsub

186
00:10:17,665 --> 00:10:18,995
Shoot him execution style?

187
00:10:19,115 --> 00:10:21,698
In other words, what the
hell is he doing with them?

188
00:10:36,421 --> 00:10:37,407
Unlock him.

189
00:10:53,691 --> 00:10:54,657
Not yet!

190
00:10:57,122 --> 00:10:58,058
Get up.

191
00:10:58,526 --> 00:10:59,547
Let's go.

192
00:11:00,568 --> 00:11:02,397
Throw the key off to the side.

193
00:11:04,549 --> 00:11:07,841
You win, you live.
You lose,

194
00:11:08,664 --> 00:11:11,500
I kill your daughter,
And I kill you.

195
00:11:12,903 --> 00:11:14,010
Understand?

196
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,232
Can you stand?

197
00:12:12,344 --> 00:12:13,731
Can you stand?

198
00:12:16,065 --> 00:12:17,389
Don't look, Jane.

199
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:30,534
Ok, we've talked to
over 200 middle schools

200
00:12:30,535 --> 00:12:33,385
And run the names of absent girls
Against their yearbook photos.

201
00:12:33,505 --> 00:12:34,548
What else?

202
00:12:34,668 --> 00:12:37,923
We're checking bios of the dads now
And calling their workplaces.

203
00:12:38,043 --> 00:12:40,871
So he hasn't been at work.
You sure?

204
00:12:41,977 --> 00:12:42,998
Both days?

205
00:12:43,508 --> 00:12:44,486
Thank you.

206
00:12:45,135 --> 00:12:46,306
What we got?

207
00:12:49,546 --> 00:12:51,355
This is Jane McBride.

208
00:12:51,356 --> 00:12:54,446
She's 14. She didn't show up
for school yesterday or this morning

209
00:12:55,018 --> 00:12:55,944
And dad?

210
00:12:56,528 --> 00:12:57,212
Ben.

211
00:12:57,803 --> 00:13:00,712
He hasn't been at his contracting
company for the last 2 days.

212
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:02,907
I love this guy.

213
00:13:04,064 --> 00:13:05,697
And the prophet speaks.

214
00:13:06,171 --> 00:13:07,546
Yes. Yes.

215
00:13:11,335 --> 00:13:12,119
Hotch.

216
00:13:13,345 --> 00:13:14,188
Cooper.

217
00:13:15,408 --> 00:13:16,823
I think we found him.

218
00:13:34,921 --> 00:13:38,072
Mrs. McBride? I'm agent Hotchner
with the fbi. This is agent Cooper.

219
00:13:38,116 --> 00:13:40,801
We're here to determine whether your
husband and your daughter are missing.

220
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:42,759
- Don't.
- Ma'am, are you ok?

221
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:44,708
Just get inside, please.

222
00:13:45,338 --> 00:13:46,227
Hurry.

223
00:13:50,882 --> 00:13:51,911
Oh, god.

224
00:13:53,676 --> 00:13:54,628
Mrs. McBride.

225
00:13:55,571 --> 00:13:57,548
You just got my family murdered.

226
00:14:13,952 --> 00:14:15,626
That's the first
victim from the park.

227
00:14:15,627 --> 00:14:17,762
The man on the phone said
he'd kill Ben and Jane

228
00:14:17,763 --> 00:14:19,230
If I brought in the police.

229
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:22,633
He said that if I needed proof,
I should check my front porch,

230
00:14:22,968 --> 00:14:25,034
And when I did, this was there.

231
00:14:26,539 --> 00:14:27,824
Oh, he's careful.

232
00:14:28,653 --> 00:14:31,289
Nothing to distinguish him
or his location.

233
00:14:31,735 --> 00:14:33,220
Were there any other instructions?

234
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,412
No, he said he'd call with more.

235
00:14:35,979 --> 00:14:38,048
Do you think he's watching?

236
00:14:38,396 --> 00:14:40,065
I mean, is he going to kill them?

237
00:14:40,122 --> 00:14:42,039
The video was shot by
a camera on a tripod,

238
00:14:42,058 --> 00:14:43,971
Which means he probably
doesn't have a partner.

239
00:14:43,978 --> 00:14:45,322
It would be almost impossible

240
00:14:45,323 --> 00:14:47,047
For him to take
your family prisoner

241
00:14:47,084 --> 00:14:48,959
And do surveillance simultaneously.

242
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,561
And he's done this before?

243
00:14:51,192 --> 00:14:54,365
So why didn't someone come forward
after to say what happened?

244
00:14:56,642 --> 00:14:58,702
He doesn't leave anybody
with knowledge alive.

245
00:14:59,576 --> 00:15:01,608
And we'll post an agent
here to keep you safe.

246
00:15:01,728 --> 00:15:03,471
Can you excuse us a moment?

247
00:15:04,359 --> 00:15:05,400
Cooper, listen.

248
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,878
Your theory's right.
We know he's killing homeless men

249
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:09,613
As well as fathers and daughters.

250
00:15:09,851 --> 00:15:11,115
But let us work it.

251
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:14,866
If you go back to D.C.now, the director
Won't know that you ignored her order

252
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:17,254
Look, I know you're sticking your
neck out on this thing for me.

253
00:15:17,255 --> 00:15:18,823
I understand. I'm not trying to--

254
00:15:18,824 --> 00:15:20,098
This isn't about me.

255
00:15:20,613 --> 00:15:22,049
I want to protect you.

256
00:15:27,499 --> 00:15:28,636
You remember him?

257
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,902
Toby Vahl.
Of course.

258
00:15:31,903 --> 00:15:35,253
You remember we got that confession
For those 5 child murders,

259
00:15:35,373 --> 00:15:38,030
But we all had that gut feeling.

260
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,926
We knew he wasn't good for all of
them. The preference was too varied.

261
00:15:41,046 --> 00:15:43,147
Local cops shut the
investigation down.

262
00:15:43,148 --> 00:15:47,251
The fbi brass, they told us
to get our asses back home.

263
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:49,954
I remember.

264
00:15:50,309 --> 00:15:51,822
Where were you when you heard

265
00:15:51,823 --> 00:15:54,091
They caught that second killer
dumping this boy's body?

266
00:15:54,092 --> 00:15:56,493
I was in Denver working on a new case.

267
00:15:57,715 --> 00:15:58,429
You?

268
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:00,264
I wasn't on anything yet.

269
00:16:00,683 --> 00:16:02,506
I could have still been there.

270
00:16:04,738 --> 00:16:06,535
I won't ignore my gut again.

271
00:16:07,772 --> 00:16:09,611
I don't care what it costs me.

272
00:16:10,455 --> 00:16:11,108
Ok.

273
00:16:12,577 --> 00:16:15,327
My people will be on the record and
we'll use yours to double manpower.

274
00:16:15,873 --> 00:16:16,771
Hotchner.

275
00:16:17,697 --> 00:16:18,595
Where?

276
00:16:20,637 --> 00:16:21,236
Ok.

277
00:16:21,753 --> 00:16:23,220
They found another body.

278
00:16:32,697 --> 00:16:33,977
So how does a brit--

279
00:16:34,097 --> 00:16:35,191
A handsome brit.

280
00:16:35,311 --> 00:16:38,168
How does a brit end up in the fbi?

281
00:16:38,169 --> 00:16:39,637
It's pretty simple.

282
00:16:39,638 --> 00:16:41,888
Cooper and I bumped into
each other a few times.

283
00:16:42,008 --> 00:16:44,475
10 months ago they told him
he could hand-pick a new team.

284
00:16:44,476 --> 00:16:47,011
He called. I came.
Passport didn't matter.

285
00:16:48,868 --> 00:16:50,474
So, is it true

286
00:16:50,849 --> 00:16:52,983
That no one in the
british special forces

287
00:16:52,984 --> 00:16:54,585
Is allowed to admit they're in it?

288
00:16:55,075 --> 00:16:57,221
I don't know. I'd have to
ask around about that one.

289
00:16:58,968 --> 00:17:01,125
You know, there's a lot
of rumors about your boss.

290
00:17:01,717 --> 00:17:04,061
One I heard was when
he left the bau,

291
00:17:04,062 --> 00:17:06,699
He was doing psychological
ops overseas.

292
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:09,803
Well...I've never
been big on rumors.

293
00:17:10,647 --> 00:17:12,603
So, I don't suppose
you're going to tell me

294
00:17:12,604 --> 00:17:14,972
Just where you two
bumped into each other.

295
00:17:17,672 --> 00:17:19,667
I'll tell you I trust
the man with my life.

296
00:17:22,027 --> 00:17:24,096
I'll tell you I'd die for the man.

297
00:17:30,455 --> 00:17:31,655
How's the mom?

298
00:17:31,656 --> 00:17:34,168
She's holding up. I don't know
how much help she's going to be.

299
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,127
So, the tenderloin
is full of junkies

300
00:17:37,128 --> 00:17:38,496
Who would be easy to control,

301
00:17:38,616 --> 00:17:40,798
But the first victim had
no drugs in his system,

302
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,300
And this geezer, it looks
pretty healthy, too.

303
00:17:44,077 --> 00:17:45,819
Except for the whole dead thing.

304
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,117
There's skin under his nails.

305
00:17:55,429 --> 00:17:57,915
Didn't the first victim have
scratch marks on his chest?

306
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:00,617
Yeah. We assumed he fought
back against the unsub,

307
00:18:00,737 --> 00:18:04,355
But these victims might
actually be fighting each other.

308
00:18:04,738 --> 00:18:05,582
Exactly.

309
00:18:06,372 --> 00:18:08,792
I take it you're about
to wow me with a theory.

310
00:18:09,257 --> 00:18:12,429
The first victim is dumped before
the fathers and daughters are taken.

311
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:13,200
Why?

312
00:18:13,563 --> 00:18:15,604
Because he wants to send
a message to the wife

313
00:18:15,724 --> 00:18:18,036
That he means business,
make sure she doesn't call the police.

314
00:18:18,156 --> 00:18:21,438
And it also sends a message to
the prisoners he already has.

315
00:18:21,439 --> 00:18:23,907
You lose a fight, you die.

316
00:18:23,908 --> 00:18:26,043
What do those welts
look like to you?

317
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:28,445
My guess--they're wounds
from rubber bullets.

318
00:18:28,446 --> 00:18:30,614
Like they use to control
rioters or prison inmates.

319
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:31,453
Ok.

320
00:18:32,484 --> 00:18:34,218
I think the unsub's been locked up.

321
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:36,754
That's where he's learned to
control his own prisoners.

322
00:18:36,755 --> 00:18:39,640
Well, if he's learned how to dominate
them, Why are they fighting each other?

323
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,258
It has to be part of his plan--

324
00:18:41,259 --> 00:18:43,127
To watch them beat the
hell out of each other.

325
00:18:43,486 --> 00:18:45,996
And then the loser is executed.

326
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:49,365
Admit it--I'm starting
to grow on you.

327
00:18:50,403 --> 00:18:51,689
Hotch, it's emily.

328
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:54,059
We have an idea about what he
might be doing with the victims.

329
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:55,875
We may be able to
give the profile--

330
00:18:55,995 --> 00:18:57,789
Hold on a second.
who are you calling?

331
00:18:57,826 --> 00:18:59,460
If I'm right,
there's somewhere else

332
00:18:59,507 --> 00:19:01,327
We need to be
delivering that profile.

333
00:19:10,055 --> 00:19:12,103
This is one for the books, huh?

334
00:19:12,223 --> 00:19:14,058
Yeah. You spend much time here?

335
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:15,607
Maybe a half a dozen interviews.

336
00:19:16,117 --> 00:19:16,793
You?

337
00:19:17,881 --> 00:19:20,059
6 years, 3 months, 4 days.

338
00:19:36,001 --> 00:19:37,114
The prophet returns.

339
00:19:37,115 --> 00:19:38,515
What up, man? How you doin'?

340
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:40,325
This is Nelson G.

341
00:19:40,372 --> 00:19:42,663
Me and him know each other
from back in the dark days.

342
00:19:42,706 --> 00:19:45,843
Man. Never expected to
ever see you in here again.

343
00:19:46,749 --> 00:19:48,659
This is agent David Rossi, fbi.

344
00:19:48,779 --> 00:19:51,728
Fbi? The first time I
see you in how long

345
00:19:51,729 --> 00:19:53,153
And you bring the fbi?

346
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,534
Get the hell outta here.

347
00:19:57,535 --> 00:19:58,836
I told you, man,

348
00:19:58,896 --> 00:20:00,507
If I ever got my
shot at redemption,

349
00:20:00,611 --> 00:20:02,658
I was gonna take my
game to the other side.

350
00:20:02,941 --> 00:20:04,241
"to open the blind eyes,

351
00:20:04,361 --> 00:20:06,390
"to take the prisoner out
of the prison and them...

352
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,594
And them that sit in darkness
out of the prison house."

353
00:20:10,371 --> 00:20:11,949
It makes sense, I guess.

354
00:20:12,686 --> 00:20:14,752
The criminals are the ones
who make the rules, right?

355
00:20:14,788 --> 00:20:16,453
Cops are the ones who gotta learn 'em.

356
00:20:18,587 --> 00:20:19,957
I need your help, man.

357
00:20:21,444 --> 00:20:22,176
Talk.

358
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,495
We have a serial killer.

359
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,684
We think he might
have done time here.

360
00:20:26,804 --> 00:20:28,349
We want to give you a description,

361
00:20:28,469 --> 00:20:30,367
And then you tell us
if you recognize him.

362
00:20:30,851 --> 00:20:32,157
Just press your connections.

363
00:20:33,805 --> 00:20:36,406
It's very likely that this
unsub has a prison record.

364
00:20:36,433 --> 00:20:37,908
He's white, and judging by the age

365
00:20:37,954 --> 00:20:40,879
Of the people he abducts,
most likely In his 30s.

366
00:20:41,067 --> 00:20:43,528
And considering the terrain
In which he's dumping the bodies,

367
00:20:43,603 --> 00:20:46,153
We think that he's imposing
or at least very physically fit.

368
00:20:46,284 --> 00:20:47,851
He also has access to a space

369
00:20:47,897 --> 00:20:50,235
That's large enough to house and
control a number of prisoners,

370
00:20:50,288 --> 00:20:52,290
All without disturbing
the neighbors.

371
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:54,638
This guy keeps to the
same hunting ground.

372
00:20:54,826 --> 00:20:56,193
Same dumpsite.

373
00:20:56,828 --> 00:20:58,124
He's a control freak.

374
00:20:58,196 --> 00:20:59,561
Real organized.

375
00:20:59,631 --> 00:21:01,906
Also, he would have been
obsessed with the guards,

376
00:21:01,966 --> 00:21:05,421
Their methods of controlling the prisoners,
especially in the yard.

377
00:21:05,543 --> 00:21:07,871
This dude kills folks the
same few days every year.

378
00:21:08,256 --> 00:21:10,808
There's no way he's that obsessed
and he's not talking about it.

379
00:21:11,241 --> 00:21:13,544
We think the man has a
daughter of his own,

380
00:21:13,545 --> 00:21:15,399
Most likely a brunette like Jane.

381
00:21:15,465 --> 00:21:17,586
The dates he chooses probably
correspond to an event

382
00:21:17,624 --> 00:21:18,931
Involving his own daughter.

383
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:21,090
Our guess is that he lost
his daughter in some way

384
00:21:21,137 --> 00:21:23,611
And it's symbolic of him not
fighting for her in the first place.

385
00:21:23,635 --> 00:21:25,331
A lot of times killers
choose victims

386
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:26,924
That are surrogates for someone,

387
00:21:26,925 --> 00:21:28,992
Like a wife or a mother.

388
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,662
In this case,
we think his own guilt

389
00:21:31,777 --> 00:21:34,765
Is making him choose surrogates
that represent himself.

390
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:50,372
The police department
has the profile.

391
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,216
They've tripled patrols
in the tenderloin.

392
00:21:52,217 --> 00:21:54,705
You know what? I think we
need profilers out here, too.

393
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,626
He could be out there hunting for
homeless men to fight the father.

394
00:21:57,813 --> 00:22:00,419
This kid--best sniper
I've ever seen.

395
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,904
He could view a lot of
ground from the rooftop.

396
00:22:02,932 --> 00:22:04,635
Are you comfortable
on the ground solo?

397
00:22:04,647 --> 00:22:05,433
Of course.

398
00:22:05,437 --> 00:22:07,062
Cooper's right.
Maybe we can catch him

399
00:22:07,137 --> 00:22:08,789
Trying to abduct another victim.

400
00:22:24,431 --> 00:22:26,629
So, what you wearing?

401
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:31,421
A gun.

402
00:22:32,288 --> 00:22:34,057
Hey, mick, explain something to me.

403
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,559
How come I'm out on the street

404
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,128
And you're sitting on
your butt on some roof?

405
00:22:38,129 --> 00:22:39,396
Well, you heard the man.

406
00:22:40,251 --> 00:22:42,966
Do you really want me to
expound on my own prowess?

407
00:22:43,251 --> 00:22:44,568
It's undignified.

408
00:22:49,662 --> 00:22:50,780
Stay on your headset.

409
00:22:50,883 --> 00:22:53,650
All his victims are coming
from this 4-block radius.

410
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,816
Hey, Jane, honey,
just save your strength.

411
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:03,487
You can't fight again.

412
00:23:04,288 --> 00:23:05,631
I don't have a choice.

413
00:23:06,795 --> 00:23:08,964
I don't care if they break
every bone in my body.

414
00:23:09,027 --> 00:23:11,879
I promise you I'm not gonna stop.

415
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,139
Ok, I've got something.

416
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,341
I'm not sure if it's anything,

417
00:23:24,455 --> 00:23:25,976
But southeast corner.

418
00:23:26,124 --> 00:23:28,111
See the guy clocking the junkie?

419
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:31,281
You care to expand on that?

420
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,275
All I see are guys
clocking junkies.

421
00:23:34,952 --> 00:23:36,085
Gray shirt.

422
00:23:37,841 --> 00:23:39,287
Yeah, I got him.

423
00:23:40,776 --> 00:23:42,426
Stay close. I'm on my way.

424
00:23:44,121 --> 00:23:45,832
He's heading south, Ben.

425
00:23:45,926 --> 00:23:47,136
Fbi! Stop!

426
00:24:16,124 --> 00:24:16,913
Hey!

427
00:24:26,851 --> 00:24:28,576
- Stop!
- I didn't do anything!

428
00:24:28,661 --> 00:24:30,140
Why were you following that man?

429
00:24:30,231 --> 00:24:32,576
I knew he was holding.
I just wanted a fix.

430
00:24:36,726 --> 00:24:38,081
I don't distribute.

431
00:24:55,965 --> 00:24:57,134
Dad!

432
00:25:18,924 --> 00:25:20,223
Why keep this up?

433
00:25:20,326 --> 00:25:22,626
She's better off with me.
We both know it.

434
00:25:24,128 --> 00:25:27,033
Soon, this will be all she knows.

435
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:34,386
You let her walk home from
school every day on her own.

436
00:25:35,176 --> 00:25:36,904
She'll be safe with me, Ben.

437
00:25:37,662 --> 00:25:39,643
She won't even miss you.

438
00:25:45,389 --> 00:25:47,117
You won't break me!

439
00:25:50,743 --> 00:25:52,320
Then it's to the death.

440
00:25:54,376 --> 00:25:55,578
To the death,

441
00:25:56,294 --> 00:25:58,161
Or I kill Jane.

442
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,000
To the death,

443
00:26:04,541 --> 00:26:05,869
Or Jane dies.

444
00:26:08,538 --> 00:26:09,749
Last chance.

445
00:26:25,013 --> 00:26:26,065
I'm so sorry.

446
00:26:27,654 --> 00:26:28,903
Sorry.

447
00:26:30,301 --> 00:26:31,561
I'm sorry.

448
00:26:44,664 --> 00:26:46,185
Did your analyst get us the data?

449
00:26:46,232 --> 00:26:47,677
Yeah, I can lay it out for you.

450
00:26:47,734 --> 00:26:49,201
Good. Let's cross-reference it

451
00:26:49,292 --> 00:26:51,311
Against our potential suspect pool.

452
00:26:51,593 --> 00:26:52,421
Hello.

453
00:26:53,304 --> 00:26:54,637
Yeah, we can be there.

454
00:26:55,815 --> 00:26:57,542
You up for a ride to San Quentin?

455
00:26:58,077 --> 00:26:59,337
It's like the old days,

456
00:26:59,546 --> 00:27:01,391
Spending all your time
interviewing prisoners.

457
00:27:01,548 --> 00:27:03,981
Don't go getting sentimental on me.

458
00:27:05,496 --> 00:27:06,718
What we got?

459
00:27:06,944 --> 00:27:08,821
The profile says he's
spent time in prison.

460
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,556
He probably lost a teenage daughter

461
00:27:10,609 --> 00:27:12,257
In a way that
corresponds to the dates

462
00:27:12,258 --> 00:27:13,722
He abducts and kills his victims.

463
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,696
We have the dates in question
divided into 4 specific subsets.

464
00:27:16,763 --> 00:27:18,530
This group is teenage
girls age 13 to 16

465
00:27:18,568 --> 00:27:20,299
Who were removed from
their fathers' care.

466
00:27:20,358 --> 00:27:22,327
These are deaths of
teenagers the same age.

467
00:27:22,364 --> 00:27:24,342
The remainder are men
arrested for violet crimes

468
00:27:24,389 --> 00:27:26,705
And anyone serving a prison
sentence during the same window.

469
00:27:26,706 --> 00:27:28,233
The stressor's in here somewhere.

470
00:27:28,299 --> 00:27:30,017
Let's find something
that looks promising

471
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:32,733
So we can start running
background checks.

472
00:27:36,667 --> 00:27:38,623
Agent Hotchner, Erin Strauss.

473
00:27:38,708 --> 00:27:39,604
Yes, ma'am.

474
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,193
I'm calling to check on
the status of your case.

475
00:27:42,296 --> 00:27:44,653
We're pursuing a secondary
line of investigation.

476
00:27:44,757 --> 00:27:46,731
And why is that?

477
00:27:46,862 --> 00:27:48,770
Let me talk to her for a second.

478
00:27:50,155 --> 00:27:51,997
Hold a moment, please.

479
00:27:54,702 --> 00:27:55,857
Ma'am?

480
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:59,128
Do you think I'm stupid,
agent Cooper?

481
00:27:59,288 --> 00:28:02,040
No, ma'am, uh,
I do not think you're stupid.

482
00:28:02,215 --> 00:28:04,901
Is it unclear when I give an order?

483
00:28:05,577 --> 00:28:09,403
You should know that agent Hotchner,
He had nothing to do with this.

484
00:28:09,845 --> 00:28:12,619
We need to be invited in
by the locals. You weren't.

485
00:28:12,652 --> 00:28:14,987
You do realize that
my theory was right?

486
00:28:15,072 --> 00:28:16,655
I want you back here today.

487
00:28:17,098 --> 00:28:18,099
I can't do that.

488
00:28:18,127 --> 00:28:20,151
- Excuse me?
- You can fire me tomorrow.

489
00:28:20,226 --> 00:28:21,827
Right now, I got less than 24 hours

490
00:28:21,857 --> 00:28:23,629
Before a father and a
daughter turn up dead

491
00:28:23,697 --> 00:28:26,304
Somewhere in the city,
and I refuse to be on an airplane

492
00:28:26,361 --> 00:28:28,376
While the son of a bitch
dumps their bodies.

493
00:28:28,433 --> 00:28:31,157
Now, with all-
all possible respect...

494
00:28:32,231 --> 00:28:34,072
I gotta go. I have work to do.

495
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,620
Tell agent Hotchner I will
deal with the both of you

496
00:28:36,695 --> 00:28:38,031
When you get back.

497
00:28:44,058 --> 00:28:45,479
So where were we?

498
00:28:49,552 --> 00:28:51,496
I want you to get
inside the girl's head.

499
00:28:51,609 --> 00:28:52,834
She's the key.

500
00:28:53,069 --> 00:28:55,127
Any insight could break this thing.

501
00:28:55,244 --> 00:28:59,121
We need to understand why he
took this girl, at this time.

502
00:29:26,693 --> 00:29:28,583
I asked around about you.

503
00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:30,534
Is it true you interviewed
charles manson

504
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,461
Before they transferred
him out of here?

505
00:29:32,583 --> 00:29:34,291
3 straight days, 1988.

506
00:29:36,004 --> 00:29:37,365
What was he like?

507
00:29:38,674 --> 00:29:39,651
Small.

508
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:41,923
Small, huh?

509
00:29:42,386 --> 00:29:43,832
Hey, you got something?

510
00:29:43,897 --> 00:29:45,077
I heard a story.

511
00:29:45,256 --> 00:29:46,500
What kind of story?

512
00:29:46,594 --> 00:29:49,073
There's this big white dude
that was in before I got sent back.

513
00:29:49,182 --> 00:29:51,016
Supposedly he's all kinds of crazy.

514
00:29:51,432 --> 00:29:53,952
Finds out his daughter died,
he goes all commando.

515
00:29:54,397 --> 00:29:57,235
Boxing, working out,
challenging everyone in the yard,

516
00:29:57,244 --> 00:29:59,891
Saying that he'd fight
them to the death.

517
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:02,076
Sounds like it could be your guy.

518
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:03,925
Yeah. Keep talking.

519
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:06,187
The story is, it got so bad

520
00:30:06,272 --> 00:30:08,704
That he started a beef
with the officers here

521
00:30:08,817 --> 00:30:10,900
And they finally put him
in solitary confinement

522
00:30:10,956 --> 00:30:12,637
To serve out the rest of his term.

523
00:30:13,483 --> 00:30:14,573
You got a name?

524
00:30:24,469 --> 00:30:25,717
What are you doing?

525
00:30:26,013 --> 00:30:27,983
Force of habit. My dad was army.

526
00:30:28,029 --> 00:30:29,687
In my house we marched.

527
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,542
He must be proud of you.

528
00:30:31,739 --> 00:30:33,340
All he knew is I gave up West Point

529
00:30:33,491 --> 00:30:35,855
For a long shot of someday
getting into the fbi.

530
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:38,256
Well, Cooper obviously has
a lot of faith in you.

531
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:40,464
He plucked you out of
the academy, right?

532
00:30:42,954 --> 00:30:43,902
What is it?

533
00:30:44,685 --> 00:30:45,868
This collage.

534
00:30:46,239 --> 00:30:47,685
Jane is telling her parents

535
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:49,541
That they don't exist in her life.

536
00:30:49,808 --> 00:30:51,877
That her interests are an
entirely different culture

537
00:30:51,956 --> 00:30:53,355
Than her parents'.

538
00:30:53,439 --> 00:30:56,182
Why would she keep a journal out
for anyone to read?

539
00:30:58,503 --> 00:30:59,684
What's in it?

540
00:30:59,751 --> 00:31:01,505
It's typical 14-year-old stuff.

541
00:31:01,627 --> 00:31:03,254
Rants about her
parents being unfair,

542
00:31:03,339 --> 00:31:05,132
Talk about some boy named David.

543
00:31:05,207 --> 00:31:07,677
Ok, so she's defiant and she
wants her parents to read it.

544
00:31:07,752 --> 00:31:09,763
No, but she's private.

545
00:31:09,942 --> 00:31:12,587
She wouldn't commit these thoughts
to paper in the first place.

546
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:14,318
Unless it was forced on her.

547
00:31:18,431 --> 00:31:20,737
Your daughter's journal
only goes back 9 months.

548
00:31:20,807 --> 00:31:22,207
What made her start keeping it?

549
00:31:22,446 --> 00:31:25,277
We went to a family counselor
who suggested jane keep it.

550
00:31:25,418 --> 00:31:26,994
Where was the office?

551
00:31:27,031 --> 00:31:28,447
In the tenderloin district.

552
00:31:30,118 --> 00:31:32,017
Ok. Got it. Good work, morgan.

553
00:31:32,436 --> 00:31:34,920
The McBride family went to a
therapy center in the tenderloin.

554
00:31:34,978 --> 00:31:37,289
The place also did evaluations
for social services.

555
00:31:37,349 --> 00:31:40,225
We profiled that the unsub may have
had his daughter taken away from him.

556
00:31:40,226 --> 00:31:41,883
If he was processed
in the same place,

557
00:31:41,911 --> 00:31:44,189
Then he would know how to target
the fathers and daughters.

558
00:31:44,255 --> 00:31:46,044
- Can I talk to your analyst?
- Sure.

559
00:31:49,942 --> 00:31:50,966
Talk to me.

560
00:31:51,022 --> 00:31:52,671
Penelope Garcia.

561
00:31:52,672 --> 00:31:54,172
Sam Cooper.

562
00:31:54,292 --> 00:31:55,615
Sam Cooper?

563
00:31:55,666 --> 00:31:57,375
As I live and breathe,
and here I thought

564
00:31:57,376 --> 00:31:58,910
You were a story someone invented.

565
00:31:58,911 --> 00:31:59,792
What you got?

566
00:31:59,842 --> 00:32:01,193
Here's what I need from you.

567
00:32:01,237 --> 00:32:02,974
Anyone processed by social services

568
00:32:03,094 --> 00:32:04,502
Who ended up losing a daughter.

569
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:06,132
I don't care how big the list is.

570
00:32:06,252 --> 00:32:08,287
I can cross-reference
it against my others.

571
00:32:08,321 --> 00:32:09,196
Roger that.

572
00:32:09,316 --> 00:32:10,716
Gonna hack like the wind.

573
00:32:10,836 --> 00:32:12,824
Prepare to be wowed, sir.

574
00:32:18,481 --> 00:32:19,388
Jane.

575
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,537
I need you to listen to me,

576
00:32:21,657 --> 00:32:25,003
'cause it might be the last
time I ever get to talk to you.

577
00:32:26,531 --> 00:32:28,974
I haven't been a
good enough father.

578
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:33,311
You're 14. You have no idea
how terrifying that is.

579
00:32:33,971 --> 00:32:38,264
So I've tried to control
what you do and who you see,

580
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:41,316
Because I wanted to keep you safe.

581
00:32:42,148 --> 00:32:44,526
And I wanted you
to go off to school

582
00:32:44,958 --> 00:32:47,125
And get a good job

583
00:32:47,436 --> 00:32:49,427
And maybe someday...

584
00:32:51,181 --> 00:32:52,297
Fall in love...

585
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:56,067
And ask me to walk
you down the aisle.

586
00:32:56,555 --> 00:32:58,503
I'm still your dad,

587
00:32:58,504 --> 00:33:00,505
And it's my job

588
00:33:01,141 --> 00:33:03,441
To look out for you.

589
00:33:05,715 --> 00:33:08,446
But I haven't been a good listener.

590
00:33:10,065 --> 00:33:12,450
I know you can hear me.

591
00:33:12,822 --> 00:33:14,653
And I'm not asking
you to say anything.

592
00:33:14,773 --> 00:33:18,137
I just want you to
know that I understand

593
00:33:18,257 --> 00:33:21,726
That I--that I can't
control everything.

594
00:33:24,662 --> 00:33:27,862
But I need the last
words you hear me say...

595
00:33:29,525 --> 00:33:31,770
To be that I love you.

596
00:33:36,409 --> 00:33:39,469
All right, my tribe,
I have a list of parents,

597
00:33:39,589 --> 00:33:41,045
Evaluated by social services,

598
00:33:41,165 --> 00:33:42,540
Who ended up losing custody.

599
00:33:42,575 --> 00:33:44,779
But as Cooper predicted,
it is a lengthy tale of woe.

600
00:33:44,817 --> 00:33:46,588
We'll use it to cross against
the teenage girls

601
00:33:46,613 --> 00:33:48,444
Who died on some of the dates in question.

602
00:33:48,491 --> 00:33:50,534
I'm going to start reading names.
You tell me if they're on your list.

603
00:33:50,581 --> 00:33:52,313
Maria Salter, Carla Denny...

604
00:33:52,433 --> 00:33:53,959
Hey. Joyce Collard, Dawn Sparrow...

605
00:33:54,225 --> 00:33:55,594
Right. Sounds like a possible.

606
00:33:55,714 --> 00:33:57,229
Thanks, prophet.

607
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,663
We have a name.

608
00:33:58,664 --> 00:34:02,044
A John Vincent Bell.

609
00:34:02,164 --> 00:34:04,386
One of the girls who died
was named Mandy Bell.

610
00:34:04,506 --> 00:34:06,448
Garcia, run the name
John Vincent Bell

611
00:34:06,568 --> 00:34:08,140
Against the family therapy list.

612
00:34:08,581 --> 00:34:09,625
Shazzam.

613
00:34:09,668 --> 00:34:12,184
Bell and his wife divorced,
then the wife died,

614
00:34:12,304 --> 00:34:15,682
And bell was declared incompetent
to have custody of the daughter

615
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:17,357
Due to a host of
mental health issues.

616
00:34:17,477 --> 00:34:18,716
We got that one right.

617
00:34:18,836 --> 00:34:20,890
Oh, lord. And then,
when social service agents

618
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:22,813
Showed up to remove the girl,

619
00:34:22,933 --> 00:34:25,794
Bell beat one of them to death,
Was given 7 years for manslaughter.

620
00:34:25,822 --> 00:34:27,465
Yeah. During which time,
his daughter

621
00:34:27,503 --> 00:34:30,048
Was in a car accident. Looks like
she survived 3 days on life support

622
00:34:30,096 --> 00:34:31,767
But eventually died
of brain injuries.

623
00:34:31,851 --> 00:34:34,519
Ok, so Bell is making these
men fight to the death

624
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,632
Just like he did.

625
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,134
He's trying to prove he did
what any father would do.

626
00:34:38,254 --> 00:34:39,502
Do we have an address?

627
00:34:39,548 --> 00:34:42,059
Uh, the only listing
I have is a gym

628
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:44,062
On hall street in the tenderloin.

629
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:46,558
It belongs to Bell's family.
Hasn't been operational for years.

630
00:34:46,586 --> 00:34:47,697
We got him.

631
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,651
I watched Jane's face
when she saw what you did.

632
00:34:52,652 --> 00:34:55,287
I told you you won't break me.

633
00:34:55,673 --> 00:34:57,289
Doesn't matter.

634
00:34:57,897 --> 00:34:59,591
You already lost her.

635
00:35:00,566 --> 00:35:02,627
But if you want to keep fighting...

636
00:35:04,497 --> 00:35:07,008
He's right. Jane.

637
00:35:08,026 --> 00:35:10,224
I want you to take
care of me.

638
00:35:10,344 --> 00:35:11,115
What?

639
00:35:11,235 --> 00:35:13,436
My dad lied to me.
He was gonna send me away.

640
00:35:13,556 --> 00:35:15,052
All right, stop. He's a liar.

641
00:35:15,172 --> 00:35:16,374
I hate you. Janey, stop.

642
00:35:16,494 --> 00:35:19,174
I will go anywhere you want.
Just please get  away from him.

643
00:35:19,294 --> 00:35:20,560
Please. No, she won't.

644
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:23,486
Listen to me. Stop this.
I will kill you, you hear me?

645
00:35:23,606 --> 00:35:26,084
I will track you down
and I will kill you.

646
00:35:26,085 --> 00:35:27,484
I will kill you!

647
00:35:27,604 --> 00:35:28,970
I don't think so.

648
00:35:29,014 --> 00:35:30,055
Wait!

649
00:35:30,056 --> 00:35:33,015
You said if I go with you,
we both live.

650
00:35:33,391 --> 00:35:35,560
Ok? I need to know
you're not a liar, too.

651
00:35:36,173 --> 00:35:37,228
Janey.

652
00:35:37,674 --> 00:35:38,879
Please.

653
00:35:39,567 --> 00:35:40,565
Don't do this.

654
00:35:40,566 --> 00:35:42,266
What are you doing, jane?

655
00:35:42,386 --> 00:35:43,272
Please...

656
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:45,267
Janey, please don't do this.

657
00:35:45,318 --> 00:35:46,838
Don't--what do you--jane!

658
00:35:47,577 --> 00:35:48,814
Janey!

659
00:35:48,934 --> 00:35:50,199
Janey!

660
00:35:50,708 --> 00:35:51,743
Jane!

661
00:36:16,305 --> 00:36:17,363
JJ.

662
00:36:17,981 --> 00:36:18,932
Go.

663
00:36:21,935 --> 00:36:23,335
Clear.

664
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,112
Hotch.

665
00:36:31,444 --> 00:36:32,603
Drop your gun!

666
00:36:37,497 --> 00:36:40,519
I need paramedics immediately
to 631 Hall Street.

667
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,990
Sir, where's your daughter Jane?

668
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,355
He took her.

669
00:36:43,356 --> 00:36:44,323
How long ago?

670
00:36:44,324 --> 00:36:46,004
Just a few minutes ago. Find her.

671
00:36:46,124 --> 00:36:47,259
Please find her.

672
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,727
I will.

673
00:36:48,728 --> 00:36:49,818
The place is clear.

674
00:36:49,938 --> 00:36:51,562
He's on the street.
He's got the girl.

675
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:54,001
- I'll stay with the father.
- Garcia, I need vehicle information

676
00:36:54,034 --> 00:36:55,167
For John Vincent Bell.

677
00:36:55,209 --> 00:36:56,802
Tell police we need an apb.

678
00:36:56,803 --> 00:36:59,119
Gina? Cooper. You're on the move.

679
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:00,506
I can hit the rooftops.

680
00:37:00,507 --> 00:37:01,507
Good. Go.

681
00:37:01,508 --> 00:37:02,689
I need a helicopter.

682
00:37:02,725 --> 00:37:05,577
Garcia, tell San Francisco P.D.
We need a chopper.

683
00:37:12,018 --> 00:37:13,672
I need everybody on their radios.

684
00:37:13,792 --> 00:37:15,554
I'm gonna be your eyes.

685
00:37:45,254 --> 00:37:47,186
All right, come on.

686
00:37:49,489 --> 00:37:51,557
There. Right there.

687
00:37:52,659 --> 00:37:53,792
We got a visual.

688
00:37:53,912 --> 00:37:55,346
Turk and Franklin.

689
00:37:55,466 --> 00:37:56,695
Southeast corner.

690
00:37:56,696 --> 00:37:58,263
We're 2 blocks away.

691
00:38:01,201 --> 00:38:02,768
Stop! Ow!

692
00:38:02,769 --> 00:38:04,448
Shut your mouth!

693
00:38:04,568 --> 00:38:06,023
Don't shine it on the street.

694
00:38:06,057 --> 00:38:07,539
Then why the hell are we up here?

695
00:38:07,542 --> 00:38:08,772
Just give me the rooftop.

696
00:38:08,789 --> 00:38:10,008
He can't escape up there.

697
00:38:10,009 --> 00:38:12,177
This guy was locked alone
in a box for 3 years.

698
00:38:12,178 --> 00:38:14,346
If he feels trapped,
his animal instinct's gonna kick in.

699
00:38:14,347 --> 00:38:16,535
He's either going to try to
burrow or climb his way free.

700
00:38:16,552 --> 00:38:18,354
And since he can't dig
his way out of here,

701
00:38:18,401 --> 00:38:20,052
I guarantee you he's
going to the roof.

702
00:38:20,053 --> 00:38:21,720
Everyone, be advised--

703
00:38:21,721 --> 00:38:23,188
He's going to the roof.

704
00:38:23,189 --> 00:38:24,957
He's going to the roof.

705
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,591
Help me!

706
00:38:28,711 --> 00:38:29,995
Help me! Come on!

707
00:38:29,996 --> 00:38:31,730
You're hurting me!

708
00:38:36,783 --> 00:38:38,470
This way.

709
00:38:46,096 --> 00:38:47,252
Come on!

710
00:38:47,309 --> 00:38:48,847
He's headed to the east corner.

711
00:38:48,848 --> 00:38:50,182
We got him trapped.

712
00:38:57,957 --> 00:39:00,692
John Bell, fbi!

713
00:39:00,693 --> 00:39:02,809
Put the weapon down!

714
00:39:02,929 --> 00:39:04,124
Don't shoot me.

715
00:39:04,244 --> 00:39:05,669
Drop the gun!

716
00:39:06,499 --> 00:39:07,507
Keep it on him.

717
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:09,268
Do not blind my agents.

718
00:39:10,937 --> 00:39:12,671
It's over! Look around you!

719
00:39:15,441 --> 00:39:18,477
Don't do it! Put it down!

720
00:39:19,372 --> 00:39:21,371
You know what if feels
like to lose your daughter.

721
00:39:21,491 --> 00:39:24,183
Do you really want to
hurt somebody else's?

722
00:39:32,201 --> 00:39:33,859
Get off the wall!

723
00:40:35,021 --> 00:40:38,590
Mr. McBride, your daughter's
here and your wife's on the way.

724
00:40:39,993 --> 00:40:41,927
They're gonna take
him to the hospital.

725
00:40:41,928 --> 00:40:44,062
The paramedics said
he's going to be ok.

726
00:40:44,063 --> 00:40:45,530
Can I talk to him?

727
00:40:45,531 --> 00:40:47,099
Yeah, of course.

728
00:40:47,988 --> 00:40:50,836
Baby. I'm so sorry.

729
00:40:51,829 --> 00:40:53,686
I didn't mean any of
the things that I said.

730
00:40:53,708 --> 00:40:54,489
I know.

731
00:40:54,807 --> 00:40:56,275
You could have died.

732
00:40:56,276 --> 00:40:58,043
Just come here. Come here.

733
00:40:58,044 --> 00:40:59,845
I love you, daddy.

734
00:40:59,846 --> 00:41:01,346
I love you, too, so much.

735
00:41:01,347 --> 00:41:03,548
I love you.

736
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:12,090
Mom.

737
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:29,675
Thank you.

738
00:41:29,795 --> 00:41:31,510
You guys want to watch
out for this one.

739
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:33,445
She's gonna have a hard
time getting over me.

740
00:41:33,565 --> 00:41:35,723
Like kicking a virus.

741
00:41:35,843 --> 00:41:36,826
You know

742
00:41:36,946 --> 00:41:39,217
I could have just missed.

743
00:41:39,218 --> 00:41:42,087
With your ego? Not a chance.

744
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:46,959
I actually think San
Quentin was nicer.

745
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,827
Yeah, trust me, it's not.

746
00:41:48,828 --> 00:41:50,405
What do you mean?

747
00:41:55,341 --> 00:41:57,769
I think you should have this.

748
00:42:03,333 --> 00:42:06,108
Why? What, you're profiling me now?

749
00:42:06,304 --> 00:42:07,646
Her mom gave it to me.

750
00:42:07,647 --> 00:42:09,371
I think it's time
you have a reminder

751
00:42:09,491 --> 00:42:11,516
That trusting your gut
has a happy ending.

752
00:42:11,517 --> 00:42:13,418
You did good today.

753
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:25,864
Oh, so you're calling
me directly now, huh?

754
00:42:25,865 --> 00:42:27,366
Don't be insolent.

755
00:42:27,367 --> 00:42:29,668
I still plan on reading
you and agent Hotchner

756
00:42:29,669 --> 00:42:31,770
The riot act when you get back.

757
00:42:31,771 --> 00:42:32,769
Well...

758
00:42:34,007 --> 00:42:35,874
It's something to look forward to.

759
00:42:35,875 --> 00:42:37,275
You did good work.

760
00:42:37,276 --> 00:42:39,644
Now, don't be an idiot.
Get on that jet with his team

761
00:42:39,645 --> 00:42:40,812
And get back home.

762
00:42:40,813 --> 00:42:42,848
I have a pile of cases for you.

763
00:42:42,849 --> 00:42:44,257
Yes, ma'am.

764
00:42:45,337 --> 00:42:47,339
So what exactly did she say?

765
00:42:48,454 --> 00:42:50,655
She said that she's going
to buy us a steak dinner

766
00:42:50,656 --> 00:42:51,774
When we get back.

767
00:42:51,894 --> 00:42:52,665
Right.

768
00:42:55,537 --> 00:42:57,973
Thanks for putting yourself
on the line for me.

769
00:42:59,207 --> 00:43:00,106
Anytime.

770
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,501
Thanks for being right.

771
00:43:06,706 --> 00:43:07,939
Toast!

772
00:43:10,343 --> 00:43:11,631
Yeah!
