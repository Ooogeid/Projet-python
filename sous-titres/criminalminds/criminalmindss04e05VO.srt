00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:37,150
{\a6}<i>MODESTO,CALIFORNIA</i>

2
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,590
What can i get you?

3
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,850
I'll take a brownie.

4
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,990
No,the big one in the corner.

5
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,340
Dessert for breakfast?

6
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,290
Must be a special occasion.

7
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,400
I just got some good news.

8
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,760
Care to share?

9
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,160
Nope,don't want to jinx it.

10
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,360
Ok. I can understand that.

11
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,530
Congratulations.

12
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:27,870
My mom always says to make time
to celebrate the little victories.

13
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,360
I like that.

14
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:32,320
Maybe i should take your mother's advice
and get something sweet with my coffee.

15
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:35,410
Oh,yeah? What are you celebrating?

16
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,980
I'll think of something.

17
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,630
They must love you here.

18
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,080
What do you mean?

19
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,750
You throw out your first cup of coffee
and then you get back in line for more.

20
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:52,970
So,either you love paying for bad coffee,
or you did all that just to talk to me.

21
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,720
You got me.

22
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,500
Have a nice day,derek.

23
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,780
So wait, she knew your name?

24
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,820
I don't know how i could
forget a face like hers.

25
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:15,150
You've been with so many girls that
you can't remember all their names?

26
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,980
Oh,come on, are you surprised?

27
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,080
This has never happened to me before.

28
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:21,020
It hasn't happened to me before either.

29
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,360
Well,it can't happen to you.

30
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,890
You have an eidetic memory.

31
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,400
Besides,you only got
one name to remember.

32
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,130
Ok.

33
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:33,920
Six victims have been killed in a series of
burglar/homicides all over central california.

34
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,130
In order...Bakersfield,
fresno,chico and,

35
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:41,400
two nights ago,alan and
brenda paisley in sacramento.

36
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,460
Big area. Are we sure
it's the same unsub?

37
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,280
His dna was found in all the homes.

38
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,070
They hadn't connected it because
he crossed jurisdictional lines.

39
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,830
The head of the sacramento field office
has established a multi-agency task force

40
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,730
And he wants us to run point.

41
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,910
Looks like we got a lot of
investigators on this one.

42
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,340
We'll streamline it if we need to.

43
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:01,870
You should know that they've already
named him the ""highway 99 killer."

44
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,430
we'll deal with that when we get there.

45
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,000
He targets 1 to 2-person households.

46
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,190
He kills the victims while they sleep.

47
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,030
Blunt force trauma with
objects found at the home.

48
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,200
Multiple bashes to the head.

49
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:16,670
After he kills the victims,he
ransacks the homes for valuables.

50
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:19,010
Which is not unusual for a
nighttime burglary-homicide.

51
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:22,480
What's unique about this unsub
is that after he kills them,

52
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,130
Apparently he sits down
to dinner in their homes.

53
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,340
They found his dna all
over the food and the table.

54
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:31,730
Are these burglaries that turned into homicides
or homicides that turned into burglaries?

55
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,870
Between the two offenses,it seems
the primary motivation is homicide.

56
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,210
Otherwise,he would have just
stolen the items and fled.

57
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,700
But he stays there for hours.

58
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:43,240
He eats their food,he tries on their clothes,
he showers,he even sleeps in their beds.

59
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,710
It's like goldilocks
became a serial killer.

60
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:49,530
They've got plenty of dna,
but they found no fingerprints.

61
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,090
He doesn't take their cars.

62
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,220
So,how does he get there?

63
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,740
No witness reports of
strange cars on the street.

64
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,850
No prints,no gun,no
noise,no car,no witnesses.

65
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,820
This all adds up to prior experience.

66
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,300
There's a record on him somewhere.

67
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,800
And until we find it, he's
moved on to another town.

68
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,780
Which could be anywhere.

"Plenty sits still. Hunger is a wander."

73
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,740
Zulu Proverb.

74
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,370
So,four homes in about five weeks.

75
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,550
The first one at the beginning
of september in bakersfield.

76
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,180
Then fresno a week later.

77
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,790
Chico eight days after that.

78
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:12,890
Then he changes direction, heads south
to sacramento at the end of september.

79
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,440
These crime scenes are
spread out over 400 miles.

80
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,490
I mean,how many serial
killers move around like that?

81
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,310
Not many.

82
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,240
Of the ones who do, we categorize
them into two subgroups.

83
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,560
In one model,he's an itinerant homeless
person, someone who's been displaced.

84
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,740
With the second type,their
occupation allows them to travel.

85
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,260
He could be killing while on business.

86
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,660
A truck driver make sense?

87
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,810
Long-haul truck driver bruce
mendenhall shot his victims

88
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:34,870
And disposed of their bodies at truck
stops,across at least 4 different states.

89
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,560
But mendenhall targeted
mostly high-risk victims.

90
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,550
Prostitutes and hitchhikers, he
picked up right off the highway.

91
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,970
A truck driver's " M. O.,"
he'd use his rig for getaway.

92
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,810
Somebody would have noticed a tractor
trailer parked in the neighborhood.

93
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,430
How about someone in corporate sales?

94
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:48,570
They still travel.

95
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,710
Or computer professionals.

96
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,470
They travel to install software.

97
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:53,780
Or someone in real estate.
Like a land assessor.

98
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:57,490
They just discovered a
new murder. In modesto.

99
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,100
He went south again.

100
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:02,070
Right,when we land,reid,jj and i
will go to task force headquarters.

101
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,910
- The 3 of you...
- Modesto.

102
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,260
We're going to log
some miles on this one.

103
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,180
{\a6}<i>Task Force Headquarters SACRAMENTO,CA</i>

104
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:10,580
I'm agent liman.

105
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,610
Hi,agent jareau. These are
agents hotchner and reid.

106
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,500
We reserved this room for you.

107
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,020
Who named him this?

108
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,030
{\a6}<i>Travel Pattern:"Highway 99 Killer"</i>

109
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,110
I did.

110
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,840
I'm gonna go get started on that memo.

111
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,040
I'm gonna help you.

112
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,620
I figured he's on highway 99, why
not call him the "highway 99 killer"?

113
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,040
I got C. H. P.to beef up
presence all over highway 99.

114
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,330
hang on,slow down.

115
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:42,860
We're going to distribute a memo to all
the investigators, retracting the name.

116
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,190
I don't understand.

117
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,760
Gary ridgeway, the green river killer,

118
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:49,130
Was burying the bodies of his victims
in the remote woods outside seattle.

119
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,510
Investigators never
thought to look there

120
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,830
Because they were too busy only
looking in the green river area.

121
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,340
All due respect,we're not
finding bodies in remote woods.

122
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:58,290
These are five homes in cities
connected by one major highway.

123
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,070
But by calling him this,you are
detrimentally influencing the investigation.

124
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:06,800
And you're establishing a relationship in the
minds of the investigators with only this highway.

125
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,590
Point taken. Fire number one
put out. Anything else,sir?

126
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,640
Are these people all
involved in the investigation?

127
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:12,340
Yes,they are.

128
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,440
- That's too many.
- What?

129
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:19,840
It's our experience in task force situations
that excessive personnel can be counterproductive.

130
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,120
These people have come from far away.

131
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,750
They've been on the
case long before you.

132
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,660
I understand that,but in order to
function effectively this task force

133
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:29,420
Needs a focused headquarters free from
the congestion of auxiliary personnel.

134
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,250
These officers will be much
more helpful in their hometowns.

135
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,920
Are we in agreement?

136
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,710
- I'll start sending people home.
- Thank you.

137
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,880
All right, listen up,guys.

138
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,930
How'd he take it?

139
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,670
He'll get over it.

140
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:12,390
{\a6}<i>MODESTO,CALIFORNIA</i>

141
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,100
- I'm detective daniels.
- How are you doing?

142
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:21,160
Agent morgan.

143
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,720
Agent rossi. Agent prentice.

144
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,870
This way.

145
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,490
You see something?

146
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,610
It's what i don't
see. What i don't hear.

147
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:33,650
There's no dogs barking.

148
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,500
No sign for an alarm system.

149
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,130
No system.

150
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,830
They have outdoor lights.

151
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,070
Neighbors said they weren't on.

152
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,280
This house has the three basic
things that a burglar looks for.

153
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:44,030
No dog,no alarm and
definitely no lights.

154
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,070
Tells us the unsub's patient enough
to find a house that's vulnerable.

155
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,550
There's the neighbor.

156
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,460
I'll talk to her.

157
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,540
Nail polish remover?

158
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,410
I think so.

159
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:02,530
He get under the sink?

160
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,390
How'd you know?

161
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,980
I've seen this kind of
thing before with burglaries

162
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,310
When the criminal is a substance abuser.

163
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:10,790
Oftentimes they huff household
cleaners, just so they can get high.

164
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,360
What was his point of entry?

165
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:14,680
Laundry room through an unlocked window.

166
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,600
Explains where he
found the murder weapon.

167
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,120
Serious overkill.

168
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:19,160
He's killing with rage.

169
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:23,160
How does a man with such rage calm himself
down enough to make coffee and eggs?

170
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:27,300
He's disorganized, picks an opportunistic
weapon at a crime scene, strikes with rage...

171
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:30,950
Organized enough though,to
follow a ritual after he kills.

172
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,430
Cools off. Cleans up, goes
through their things,eats.

173
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,100
Intense rage followed by a long period
of calmness spent inside the house.

174
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:40,130
- Is that unusual?
- Very.

175
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,830
Can you explain what he
does with his clothes?

176
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,890
His clothes?

177
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:49,490
Did you happen to notice any strangers
in the neighborhood last night?

178
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,000
No. Nothing like this has
ever happened around here.

179
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:55,200
When was the last time you spoke
to or heard from the sullivans?

180
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:59,280
I saw larry this morning on the balcony
when i went out to get the paper.

181
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:00,720
And what time was that?

182
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:03,440
About 5:30 am.

183
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,360
Mrs. Nelson,are you sure you saw
someone up there this morning?

184
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:11,020
Well,it was still dark
out,but yes,i'm sure.

185
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,110
Why?

186
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,920
Your neighbors died around 1:00 am.

187
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:19,580
When we found the deceased, the
shirt was placed over his chest.

188
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,310
The pants over his legs.

189
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,170
This is the first time
we're hearing this.

190
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,170
Look at his clothes,rossi,
the dirt stain.

191
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,060
Why would he cover up the body?

192
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:30,380
He wears their clean clothes,
sleeps in their nice bed,

193
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,700
And then puts his dirty clothes
on the male victim's body.

194
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,160
This might be some form of transference.

195
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,410
Transfer of what?

196
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:42,770
By symbolically dressing mr. Sullivan in
his clothes, he's equalizing their status.

197
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:46,580
Mr. Sullivan has all these
things and he doesn't.

198
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,680
This guys got a problem
with his station in life.

199
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,680
He can't bring himself up on his own,

200
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:54,590
So he makes himself feel better by
destroying others and living their lives.

201
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,370
That might be why he stays so long.

202
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,620
He needs that time just
so he can feel at home.

203
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:01,250
And pretends this is all his.

204
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,050
He's playing out his fantasy.

205
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:06,410
Given this behavior,the dirty
clothes,the cheap drug choice,

206
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,290
I'd say we're looking for
someone who's homeless.

207
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,940
How does a homeless man move
about the state like this?

208
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,670
I have one idea.

209
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,560
Yeah?

210
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:15,730
Reid,are you in front of a map?

211
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,060
Yeah,i am now.

212
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:19,240
I think i know how the
unsub's getting around.

213
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:23,230
Do you see tracks linking
bakersfield to sacramento?

214
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:26,830
He's hopping trains.

215
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,810
*******

216
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:06,290
The guy we're looking for is
using freight trains to get around.

217
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,640
He targets homes within
a mile of the tracks.

218
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:11,500
Bulls and 'bos don't
usually cross paths.

219
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,000
Bulls and 'bos?

220
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,430
They call rail cops bulls.

221
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,890
We call them 'bos, as in hobos.

222
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,310
You're saying you rarely
see hobos around here?

223
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,360
I see them plenty.

224
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,620
But to tell you the truth, i'm
nothing more than an armed scarecrow.

225
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,780
They see me coming,
they get the hell away.

226
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,720
Their biggest problem
is with each other.

227
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,090
You mean turf disputes?

228
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:36,110
You get two of them in one
boxcar,it usually gets ugly.

229
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:38,720
So,if a 'bo jumps off one of
these trains in a new town,

230
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,740
Is there someplace he goes first?

231
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,040
The jungle.

232
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:43,730
That's what they call the camps.

233
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,300
Local one's a couple of
hundred yards that way.

234
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,930
Do you happen to have a
vending machine in here?

235
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,370
Yeah.

236
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:52,690
Where are you?

237
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:58,100
I'm just off highway 99, the whole drive
up from modesto,all i see are crops.

238
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,840
Just rows and rows of crops.

239
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:02,540
Farmlands. You can't see
that from standard road maps.

240
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:06,660
The railway track runs parallel
to highway 99 most of the way.

241
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,950
I think i'm seeing a lot
of what the unsub saw.

242
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:11,180
Most of central california
is one big valley,

243
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,100
A flat basin completely surrounded
by mountain ranges on all sides,

244
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:17,310
Supported by rivers,lakes and
aqueducts. It's ideal for farming.

245
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,590
Well,i don't know what it gets us,

246
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,000
But i think we should at least
factor it into the conversation.

247
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,020
I agree.

248
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:24,990
Go ahead,guys, i'm listening.

249
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:28,470
Garcia,i need you to look into small
farm towns all over central california.

250
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:31,570
Track all unsolved homicides
that involved nighttime burglaries

251
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,780
In homes within a mile of train tracks.

252
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,840
Oh,you think there's more?

253
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,390
I don't know.

254
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,150
Let's get started.

255
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,240
I'd just like to reiterate that this
unsub is not getting around on highway 99.

256
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:47,510
His travel is linked in close
proximity to railway lines.

257
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,610
He's targeted 5 homes and
killed 8 people in 6 weeks.

258
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:54,810
We're looking for a male, indigent
transient between the ages of 25 and 45.

259
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:59,310
He's fit enough for the physical demands of
train hopping, or "catching out" as they call it.

260
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,360
He'll be bruised from
jumping on and off trains.

261
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:05,090
And he might also be beat up from just
defending himself in any kind of turf wars.

262
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,740
He may look homeless,but he's taking
clothing from his victims' homes.

263
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:10,490
So he'll be the only transient
on the tracks in clean clothing.

264
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,030
The trains and the
rail yards are his home.

265
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:16,430
And when he gets tired of these,
he chooses a house to make his own.

266
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:20,250
He'll have a pronounced red,dry
rash around his mouth and nose,

267
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,920
What's commonly referred
to as a "sniffer's rash."

268
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:23,990
how do we know that?

269
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,410
He takes household cleaners.

270
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:28,570
And we believe he's abusing
them as psychoactive inhalants.

271
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:34,470
Nail polish remover, glue,paint thinner, lighter
fluid,whatever is the cheapest high available.

272
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,290
They're referred to as "tollyheads"

273
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:40,020
Because they derive a high from
sniffing toluene, a chemical solvent.

274
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,110
Once inhaled,the effects
are felt instantaneously.

275
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,960
We believe he's living out
a fantasy in these homes.

276
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:49,250
The fantasy is that it is
his house for the night.

277
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:52,240
He spends hours enjoying the
comforts of his victims' homes.

278
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:56,470
Upon leaving, he takes clothing,
money,jewelry, and small electronics.

279
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,660
If you get close to
him, you won't miss him.

280
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:03,090
He will smell like a combination
of human filth and paint thinner.

281
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,980
See that?

282
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:49,310
We're not looking for jesus today.

283
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,910
We're not with a church.

284
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,690
How about a favor for a favor?

285
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,240
- Not interested.
- Speak for yourself.

286
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,330
Y'all want some mulligan stew?

287
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,270
No,thanks. I'll pass.

288
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,170
We're looking for someone
who's been burglarizing homes.

289
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,370
Wasn't me.

290
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:20,470
Wait. Y'all talking about texas?

291
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,410
He recently moved through modesto.

292
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:31,860
May have tried pawning off
some electronics,some jewelry.

293
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,200
Oh,yeah, i remember him.

294
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:36,900
He sold me some nice diamonds.

295
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,990
He's just kidding.

296
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,100
This guy's jumping
trains from city to city.

297
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,970
He breaks into people's homes and
kills them while they're sleeping.

298
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,540
Do you still think it's funny?

299
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,610
What's your friend over there doing?

300
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:54,480
He's telling the next 'bo who
comes around to watch out for cops.

301
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,550
Got a lot of symbols around here...

302
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,520
Like this one.

303
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:03,150
Can you tell me what they all mean?

304
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,390
Depends on how fast you can
get me a bottle of whiskey.

305
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,370
And some more nutter butters.

306
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,230
He's kicking a lot today.

307
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,270
In the third trimester, there's an
average of 30 fetal movements per hour.

308
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,880
Babies kick to explore
movement and strengthen muscle.

309
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:30,210
Have you ever actually felt a baby kick?

310
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,580
You feel that?

311
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,670
Does it freak you out?

312
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,340
No,not at all. Why?
Does it freak you out?

313
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,670
Very much so.

314
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,580
Ok.

315
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,670
Hey,garcia.

316
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:44,960
Bad news alert.

317
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:47,150
Hold on one second. Guys?

318
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,340
What is it?

319
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,800
I had garcia look into all unsolved
burglary homicides in central california,

320
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:57,660
Paying particularly
attention to small farm towns.

321
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:00,150
I found his dna in three more cities.

322
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,480
How did i miss this?

323
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:05,250
Small towns don't always link their evidence
up to state or national dna databases.

324
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,480
It can happen when unsubs
cross jurisdictional lines.

325
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:08,790
What are the cities,garcia?

326
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,120
Tehachapi,vacaville, and
orange cove. All farm towns.

327
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:15,080
All super far away from highway 99.

328
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,330
Ok. Thanks,jj.

329
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,870
The unsub's killed in three other
small towns we didn't know about.

330
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,030
Where do these murders
sit in the timeline?

331
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,650
One of them was before bakersfield.

332
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:31,730
Small mountain town called tehachapi.

333
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,480
If that was his first,we need to
find out what happened at that house.

334
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:43,590
You considering it?

335
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,620
Considering what?

336
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:47,510
Having baby geniuses one day.

337
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:49,640
Hello?

338
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:52,790
I've noticed in the cities, including
the new ones we've discovered,

339
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,790
There's a spike in the sales of certain
crops during the time the unsub is there.

340
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,850
Last week of august,
apples in tehachapi.

341
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,080
First week of september,
tomatoes in bakersfield.

342
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:06,290
Second week of september,
fall squashes in fresno.

343
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,470
So he's in town for a big harvest.

344
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,760
We have an unsub riding trains
town to town during big harvests

345
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:14,230
Who doesn't have a car
or permanent residence.

346
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,920
Migrant farm worker.

347
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,380
Ma!

348
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,360
Pa!

349
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:43,760
Mommy!Mommy!

350
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:46,800
He left a shirt on
his male victim again.

351
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:48,860
That's not all he left.

352
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,990
"modesto couple victims
of highway 99 killer."

353
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:55,680
This was printed before we released to
the press he's using trains to get around.

354
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:58,190
He's taunting us,telling
us he's smarter than we are

355
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,180
Because we got his mode
of transportation wrong.

356
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:03,190
The more confident he gets, the more
he's experimenting with his ritual.

357
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:05,060
The first few murders
were 5 to 8 days apart.

358
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,820
This one was just one day since modesto.

359
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,490
If we don't find him soon...

360
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:12,090
Goldilocks will be sleeping
in someone else's bed tonight.

361
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,420
His first murder.

362
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:16,820
We're trying to find
out why it started here.

363
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:19,400
Mildred younce was 68 years
old at the time of her death.

364
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:20,720
Lived by herself.

365
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,640
She would have been an
easy target for a burglar.

366
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24,400
She was killed in her
bed just like the others.

367
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:25,700
But no signs of a break-in?

368
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,600
We think she may have
left her windows open.

369
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,670
Who was your best suspect?

370
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,560
We found 17 sets of prints in there.

371
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:34,020
Most of them belonged to transients.

372
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:37,800
She was known to offer food in
exchange for work around the house.

373
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,420
Hey,what would i find
further down this road here?

374
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,890
Well,there's train tracks down there.

375
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:47,330
Rossi,not just train tracks.

376
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:49,960
This couple is hispanic.

377
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:51,340
The previous couples were caucasian.

378
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,000
He switched his victim profile.

379
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:55,030
I don't think he knows or
cares what race they were.

380
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,520
I think this house was
just an easy target.

381
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,450
- Yeah?
- So,we got something.

382
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:05,070
Jewelry stolen from the home in sacramento
turned up at a pawn shop in modesto.

383
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,540
Garcia just sent you a
picture from the security cam.

384
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,140
Yeah,i got it.

385
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:14,720
Employee said he was about 5'8",
slight,late thirties, dark skin.

386
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,360
With a red rash around his mouth.

387
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,800
Circulate the picture,jj.

388
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,880
I'm already on it.

389
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,940
As it turns out, all the big
farms set up housing camps

390
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:43,120
for the workers during harvest.

391
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:46,620
But these camps are partly
subsidized by the state,

392
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:49,840
Thus they require id and
a strict sign-in policy,

393
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:51,890
Giving us a way to track migrants.

394
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:56,080
So,i called the camps and they're
busy faxing me the lists i requested.

395
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:00,090
All right. Well,we need to see if any of these
farm workers traveled the same route as our unsub.

396
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:06,780
- Remember this one?
- Yeah. Safe camp.

397
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,740
How do you know what
all these signs mean?

398
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,880
We had a little help.

399
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:12,270
Rossi,safe water.

400
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,890
When it's not dry. Here's another one.

401
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:18,070
Oh,yeah,the train.

402
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,370
Catch you out here.

403
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,820
This is mildred younce's address.

404
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,630
Ok.

405
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,560
The cat means friendly old lady.

406
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:31,690
The "the" means she trades
food or shelter for work.

407
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,170
At 718 maple.

408
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:37,040
So whoever knows this code knew mildred
younce opened up her house to strangers?

409
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,270
If you wanted the house to yourself,

410
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:42,210
The only thing standing in your way
is a defenseless little old lady.

411
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,090
Yeah,jj. Go ahead.

412
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:48,310
Hey,morgan, there's an apple farm about
three miles away from mildred younce's house.

413
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:49,620
Yeah. We saw it on the way over here.

414
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:52,910
Can you and rossi go there and see
if they kept employment records?

415
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:56,930
Hotch wants a list of people who worked
there the few days before mildred was killed.

416
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,680
All right. We're on our way.

417
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,660
Hey,update from headquarters.

418
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:06,700
Rossi and morgan are on their
way to that farm in tehachapi.

419
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:10,630
I found a representative from the
local housing authority,cesar jimenez.

420
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:11,780
He's expecting you.

421
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,370
Press release went out to the media
with a photo from the pawn shop.

422
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,530
And i'm waiting to hear back from
garcia about tracking migrants

423
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,000
Who may have traveled the
same route as our unsub.

424
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,210
Jj,what are we going to do without
you when you go on maternity leave?

425
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:26,470
You think i'd just leave you hanging?

426
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:27,990
Does that mean you have a plan?

427
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I don't know. You'll see.

428
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:54,790
I'm agent hotchner.

429
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,560
Cesar from the housing authority.

430
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:57,880
These are agents prentiss and reid.

431
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:59,670
Good morning. Good morning.

432
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,790
Thank you for meeting us here.

433
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,890
Does this man look familiar to you?

434
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,590
Hard to tell.

435
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:08,170
Have you had any
complaints in the camps?

436
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:10,330
This man would show disruptive behavior.

437
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:13,340
He might be stealing things from
other workers, starting fights.

438
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,580
He sniffs chemicals to get high.

439
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:18,630
Well,our facilities have
a zero tolerance policy.

440
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:21,990
No drinking,no drugs,
certainly no violence.

441
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:25,620
Anyone who cannot follow these
rules would be kicked out.

442
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,910
Have you kicked anyone out recently?

443
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,570
The camps in this area
are at full capacity.

444
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,800
We have to turn people away.

445
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:34,790
Thank you.

446
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,680
Mucho gusto.

447
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,050
If he's pawning the jewelry
he's stealing to get money,

448
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,560
Why is he still working in the fields?

449
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,600
Here's another question. Why is
he circling the farm towns at all?

450
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:51,950
There are over 140,000 miles
of tracks in this country.

451
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,000
He could go anywhere.

452
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,890
But he's still in california.

453
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,060
Something's keeping him here.

454
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,110
What is it?

455
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:28,180
Ok,mini-lesson.

456
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,430
Migrants travel and work in these groups
and the groups are called cuadrillas.

457
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:35,670
Now,i have found one such cuadrilla that
was in chico at the same time as our unsub.

458
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,170
And then i checked and they
were in sacramento and modesto

459
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:40,850
And vacaville at the same
time as our unsub as well.

460
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:42,130
What about the first town?

461
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:45,350
I got employment records from
the apple farm in tehachapi.

462
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:49,330
This cuadrilla last worked there two
days before mildred younce was killed.

463
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,140
Now,here's the whammy.

464
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:54,320
An armando salinas checked in
with this group in tehachapi.

465
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,870
But then, he falls off the map.

466
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:57,820
There's no sign of him
in any of the camps.

467
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,530
- Interesting.
- Double whammy.

468
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:03,100
Customs and immigration have a rap
sheet on him for theft and assault

469
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,220
And he's wanted in
connection to some burglaries.

470
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,840
There's the record
we've been looking for.

471
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,910
Triple whammy.

472
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,350
His fingerprints were one of 17
found at mildred younce's house.

473
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:13,770
Get us his photo and get jj
to get it out to the media.

474
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,070
We're going to need the public's help.

475
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,100
Sending you his mug.

476
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:20,720
The group that he's been following, they
checked into lockeford early this morning.

477
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:22,990
That's not far from you.

478
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,860
Good.......

479
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:10,920
I am........

480
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:14,560
These........

481
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,520
Please.....

482
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:23,490
Stop. Let them go. Let them go.

483
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:28,160
We're sorry to interrupt your evening.

484
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:29,720
But we've come here
because we need your help.

485
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:33,480
We're......

486
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:37,070
Go ahead and read out the names
of the men in the cuadrilla.

487
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:43,000
"ricky zaparilla, ruben garcia,

488
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:46,640
"felix zapato, olman hernandez,

489
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:52,220
"Roberto hernandez,
arturo torres,tony guzman."

490
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,750
Sir....

491
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:03,320
Si.

492
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:07,850
It's his brother. Por favor.

493
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:17,770
When's......

494
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:21,810
A......

495
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:24,770
Do.....

496
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,580
Well.....

497
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,550
He........

498
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:33,670
He likes to know where i'm going.

499
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:35,390
Why does he have to follow you?

500
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,970
Why isn't he with you anymore?

501
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,780
He's not a good worker.

502
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:43,310
He got us fired from a big job.

503
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:46,910
My cuadrilla wanted him gone.

504
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,340
- So you kicked him out?
- Si.

505
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:53,210
Your brother has been
following you ever since.

506
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:57,150
Burglarizing homes and
killing people in every city.

507
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:01,810
Is that where he gets the money from?

508
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,600
What do you mean?

509
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,810
He's been leaving me money at the camps.

510
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:08,510
Does he know you're
in lockeford right now?

511
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:12,720
I found this at the camp today.

512
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,540
Just-- un
momento.

513
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,390
The killings started in tehachapi.

514
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,100
I think his brother rejecting
him must have been a stressor.

515
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:24,340
Morgan and rossi made it here,
they're with rail security.

516
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:26,120
Hotch and liman are
patrolling neighborhoods.

517
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:27,720
Ok. I think it's time
to get these guys going.

518
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:30,490
Excuse me. Could we have your
attention,please? Everybody?

519
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,950
This is armando ruis salinas.

520
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,750
He is 38 years old, a mexican national.

521
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:40,000
We believe he is currently in the vicinity
of lockeford and its outlying towns.

522
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,350
He'll only target homes
within a mile of train tracks.

523
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,990
You'll be assigned search quadrants.

524
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:45,450
Think the way a burglar would.

525
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,650
Pay close attention to houses
that have no exterior lights on,

526
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:51,900
No security alarm signs
or barking dogs nearby.

527
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:53,840
Let's go.

528
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:10,980
Are you surprised the
police are looking for him?

529
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:14,240
He's my half-brother.

530
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:19,010
I wasn't around for
him when he was young.

531
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:22,640
He's been in trouble all his life.

532
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:25,710
Was in jail in mexico.

533
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:31,870
I thought if he came to
work with me,he would change.

534
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,470
I'm grateful to work.

535
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,000
But armando hated work.

536
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:47,500
Hated the camps.

537
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:53,820
Always complained he never
had a nice bed to sleep on.

538
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,310
What if he's already inside a house?

539
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:59,410
Then we'll find more
bodies in the morning.

540
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:36,700
When he was a kid,
he slept on the floor.

541
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:42,440
In jail, he slept on the floor.

542
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:45,650
All he ever talked about

543
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:50,410
was having a house of his own.

544
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:54,550
A bed to sleep on.

545
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,490
The suspect is considered
extremely dangerous.

546
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,640
Authorities believe he
is still in california.

547
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:20,330
The fbi is warning residents to lock all
doors and keep all lights on through the night.

548
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:24,370
In other news, college
tuition fees jumped a record...

549
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:41,050
Suspect seen fleeing the 400
block of pear blossom avenue.

550
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:43,510
All units respond.

551
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,580
Morgan,that's in your area.

552
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:46,570
I'm gonna send hotch for back-up.

553
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:04,600
I saw him run down toward the trains!

554
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:06,110
But i lost him.

555
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,930
There's over 100 freight
cars on these tracks.

556
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:10,130
About a third of them are open boxcars.

557
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,490
That's where he'll be hiding.

558
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,870
Middle. I'll take south. You go north.

559
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:17,600
We don't think he's armed,
but he is very dangerous.

560
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,290
We got a train,morgan.

561
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:02,510
Fbi! Stop!

562
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,440
I got him,rossi!

563
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,420
Hotch,morgan's chasing the
unsub on a moving train.

564
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,040
They're heading south towards town.

565
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:50,020
I'm on it.

566
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,950
Come on. You're driving.
Get me up next to that train.

567
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:05,600
I'm so sorry.

568
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,560
"Beyond the east the sunrise,
"beyond the west the sea,

569
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:32,340
"and the east and west, the
wander-thirst, that will not let me be."

570
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:34,950
Gerald gould.

571
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,010
You guys have plans tonight?

572
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,430
I was thinking about getting a burger.

573
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,620
Oh,i could eat.

574
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,930
Oh,hey,guys,i wanted to
introduce you to someone.

575
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,760
This is agent jordan todd.

576
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:46,200
She'll be taking over for me
while i'm on maternity leave.

577
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:48,280
Agent jareau's told me
so much about you all.

578
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:49,920
You must be agent prentiss.

579
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,340
Yes. Nice to meet you.

580
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:53,540
Hello,dr. Reid.

581
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:55,180
And agent morgan.

582
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,950
- Nice to see you again.
- Nice to see you,too.

583
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,480
So this must be the good news.

584
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:02,450
This would be my brownie.

585
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,200
You two have met?

586
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:06,100
Briefly.

587
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:12,130
Well,agent todd comes to us from
7 years at counter-terrorism.

588
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:15,420
I'm really looking forward to working
with the behavioral analysis unit.

589
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:16,950
We're starting her training now.

590
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:18,640
You're traing her right now?

591
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:21,370
Well,we're kinda running
out of time. So...

592
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,040
Let me introduce you
to the rest of the team.

593
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:26,660
Yeah. I'll see you all
in the field... Team.

594
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:28,940
We're looking forward to it.

595
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,530
So,is there anything
you want to tell us?

596
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,490
Nope.

597
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,930
Your forehead's sweating.

598
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:38,800
No,it's not.

599
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:40,480
Oh,he's avoiding eye contact.

600
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:42,250
His blink rate just sped up.

601
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:44,940
You know,guys,i don't think i
want that burger too much anymore.

602
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:46,710
Oh,come on. You can't run from us.

603
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,410
Oh,watch me.
