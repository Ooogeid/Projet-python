1
00:00:07,167 --> 00:00:08,868
Run, you can make it!

2
00:00:08,934 --> 00:00:10,367
Run! come on!

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,000
Next.

4
00:00:19,667 --> 00:00:21,601
Uh, darrin call.

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,701
Oh, i don't have anything.

6
00:00:28,767 --> 00:00:31,601
No, no, no.
i've got a refill left.

7
00:00:31,667 --> 00:00:33,000
Could you just--
it's call.

8
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:36,100
Can you just
check that again?

9
00:00:36,167 --> 00:00:38,000
I have one refill.

10
00:00:40,701 --> 00:00:42,434
No, no, i'm sorry.

11
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:45,434
It's not--that ain't good.

12
00:00:45,501 --> 00:00:48,868
That's not good.
that's not--it's just--

13
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:51,968
Are you ok?

14
00:00:52,033 --> 00:00:54,601
Make it stop! just--

15
00:00:54,667 --> 00:00:57,267
Make it--

16
00:00:57,334 --> 00:00:59,067
I need to make it stop!

17
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:00,033
Mr. call--

18
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,300
Aren't you gonna help me?!

19
00:01:01,367 --> 00:01:02,734
Here--yes, here.
i'm sorry.

20
00:01:02,801 --> 00:01:04,634
Just please--
please stop. stop.

21
00:01:04,701 --> 00:01:06,200
That's not it!

22
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:07,868
That is not it!

23
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:10,200
[groans]

24
00:01:10,267 --> 00:01:11,434
Hey.

25
00:01:11,501 --> 00:01:13,400
Hey.
i just--

26
00:01:13,467 --> 00:01:14,701
I just, uh--
hey.

27
00:01:14,767 --> 00:01:15,868
Relax.

28
00:01:15,934 --> 00:01:17,200
It's ok.
i just--

29
00:01:17,267 --> 00:01:19,067
It's ok.

30
00:01:23,033 --> 00:01:24,167
Uhh! uh!

31
00:01:24,234 --> 00:01:26,501
Aah! god!

32
00:01:26,567 --> 00:01:28,334
Uhh!
woman: oh, my god!

33
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,734
Oh, my god,
are you all right?

34
00:01:30,801 --> 00:01:32,934
Look what you've done!

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Uhh!

36
00:01:35,067 --> 00:01:37,501
Please, somebody help him!

37
00:01:37,567 --> 00:01:38,834
Aah!

38
00:01:38,901 --> 00:01:40,701
[grunting]

39
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,701
Put the knife down, now.

40
00:01:42,767 --> 00:01:44,467
Aah!

41
00:01:45,467 --> 00:01:47,067
Aah!

42
00:01:47,901 --> 00:01:50,000
Uhh! oh!

43
00:01:51,701 --> 00:01:53,901
Uhh!

44
00:01:53,968 --> 00:01:57,734
[all groaning]

45
00:02:07,434 --> 00:02:09,267
He's not in yet.

46
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:15,667
What?

47
00:02:15,734 --> 00:02:18,767
You've been walking
past hotch's office
for an hour.

48
00:02:18,834 --> 00:02:22,267
Emily's picking him up.

49
00:02:23,868 --> 00:02:25,968
Hotch told me
he was cleared to drive.

50
00:02:26,067 --> 00:02:27,067
He is.

51
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:29,200
She wants to do it.

52
00:02:31,467 --> 00:02:33,734
What's going on?

53
00:02:39,801 --> 00:02:41,534
He's only had a month off,
rossi.

54
00:02:41,601 --> 00:02:43,601
Technically, 34 days.

55
00:02:43,667 --> 00:02:45,267
And you think
that's long enough?

56
00:02:45,334 --> 00:02:47,734
You don't? tell him.

57
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:50,701
No, thanks.
i like my job.

58
00:02:50,767 --> 00:02:53,734
You like him more.

59
00:02:56,334 --> 00:02:58,501
What if he's got ptsd?

60
00:02:58,567 --> 00:03:00,534
He was evaluated.

61
00:03:00,601 --> 00:03:01,968
Come on, rossi,
we wrote those questions.

62
00:03:02,033 --> 00:03:04,100
Hotch knows exactly
how to answer them.

63
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:05,300
So what are you gonna do,

64
00:03:05,367 --> 00:03:06,634
Pick apart
everything he does?

65
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:09,367
How long should he be gone?
a year? 2?

66
00:03:09,434 --> 00:03:11,300
Every day that foyet
is out there, hotch loses,

67
00:03:11,367 --> 00:03:13,100
And you know that.

68
00:03:13,167 --> 00:03:14,801
You know what
that makes hotch?

69
00:03:14,868 --> 00:03:15,934
Distracted.

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,734
Motivated.

71
00:03:26,033 --> 00:03:28,067
Derek.

72
00:03:32,701 --> 00:03:35,234
He's coming back
because he has to.

73
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,734
He needs to know
we've got his back.

74
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,067
He knows that.

75
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:43,701
Then we don't let him
forget it.

76
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:54,601
Reid: thanks.

77
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,100
Does it hurt?

78
00:03:56,167 --> 00:03:58,000
It really only hurts
when i think about it,

79
00:03:58,067 --> 00:03:59,868
Which is pretty much
all the time.

80
00:04:01,334 --> 00:04:02,734
No, no, no.

81
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:04,133
What?
get away, you.

82
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,367
These are for hotch.

83
00:04:05,434 --> 00:04:07,033
I get shot in the leg
and i don't get any cookies.

84
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,567
You know he's gonna hate
the attention.

85
00:04:08,634 --> 00:04:10,434
It's cookies, not cake.

86
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:13,067
He's probably gonna pretend
like nothing happened, anyway.

87
00:04:13,133 --> 00:04:14,634
Well, it doesn't mean
we have to.

88
00:04:14,701 --> 00:04:16,033
I think maybe we should.

89
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,234
I don't roll that way.

90
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,534
I've been thinking about it?

91
00:04:18,601 --> 00:04:19,834
The entire time
i've known hotch,

92
00:04:19,901 --> 00:04:21,601
I don't think i've ever
seen him blink.

93
00:04:21,667 --> 00:04:22,534
I know.

94
00:04:22,601 --> 00:04:23,601
It's weird.

95
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:25,133
Classic alpha male behavior.

96
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,400
Do you think
he stared down foyet?

97
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:30,601
Maybe. if it would
save his life.

98
00:04:30,667 --> 00:04:33,300
Do you think he stared
the whole time,
like with each stab?

99
00:04:33,367 --> 00:04:35,934
I have no idea.

100
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,367
Is he ok?

101
00:04:37,434 --> 00:04:39,601
I wouldn't be, but...

102
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:41,634
I'm a blinker.

103
00:04:41,701 --> 00:04:43,200
Spence, there you are.

104
00:04:43,267 --> 00:04:44,667
Grab your go bag.
what's going on?

105
00:04:44,734 --> 00:04:45,667
Turn on the news.

106
00:04:45,734 --> 00:04:47,067
Which one?

107
00:04:47,133 --> 00:04:48,367
It doesn't matter.

108
00:04:48,434 --> 00:04:50,167
Just after 8:00
this morning,

109
00:04:50,234 --> 00:04:51,667
40-year-old darrin call,

110
00:04:51,734 --> 00:04:53,467
A lifelong resident
of louisville,

111
00:04:53,534 --> 00:04:55,467
Assaulted customers
at the pharmacy

112
00:04:55,534 --> 00:04:58,100
On the corner of main
and truxton avenues.

113
00:04:58,167 --> 00:05:00,334
Eyewitnesses saw him
walking east on main street

114
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,734
Minutes after the attack.

115
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,334
He has not been seen
since then.

116
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,133
We're going to louisville.

117
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,434
He was wearing
a blue shirt, jeans,

118
00:05:06,501 --> 00:05:07,767
And a light-gray jacket.

119
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:10,100
Within the hour, the governor
has called in all sources

120
00:05:10,167 --> 00:05:11,300
For a manhunt.

121
00:05:11,367 --> 00:05:13,133
Despite these statewide efforts,

122
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,033
The suspect has eluded
law enforcement.

123
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,300
The body count is rising.
3 are confirmed dead--

124
00:05:18,367 --> 00:05:19,300
[knock on door]

125
00:05:19,367 --> 00:05:20,334
Including
an armed bank guard

126
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,634
Whose gun was used
in the attack.

127
00:05:22,701 --> 00:05:24,434
Another 2 remain
in critical condition.

128
00:05:24,501 --> 00:05:26,634
The assailant
is still out there.

129
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:27,834
We are going back
to eric jennings

130
00:05:27,901 --> 00:05:30,400
Who's been talking
to residents of louisville--

131
00:05:30,467 --> 00:05:32,033
[turns off tv]

132
00:05:39,467 --> 00:05:41,133
Hey.
hey.

133
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,901
What do we know about
this case in kentucky?

134
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:45,801
Uh, there's no connection
between call and his victims.

135
00:05:45,868 --> 00:05:47,834
Louisville p.d.'s
covered the city,

136
00:05:47,901 --> 00:05:49,334
But there hasn't been
any sign of him

137
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,834
Since he left the pharmacy.

138
00:05:50,901 --> 00:05:52,167
You check his house, family?

139
00:05:52,234 --> 00:05:54,901
Locals are on it.

140
00:05:54,968 --> 00:05:56,767
Start with
his most recent history.

141
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:58,767
Find the stressor.

142
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,400
Uh, don't move.

143
00:06:02,467 --> 00:06:04,000
[setting alarm]

144
00:06:04,067 --> 00:06:05,334
Ready?

145
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,300
Are you?

146
00:06:19,334 --> 00:06:21,434
So our point person
in louisville

147
00:06:21,501 --> 00:06:23,634
Is lieutenant
kevin mitchell.

148
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,767
Good morning.

149
00:06:25,834 --> 00:06:26,767
Good to see you.

150
00:06:26,834 --> 00:06:28,267
You, too.

151
00:06:28,334 --> 00:06:29,434
You look well, sir.
thank you.

152
00:06:29,501 --> 00:06:30,467
How long
do you have that?

153
00:06:30,534 --> 00:06:33,434
I'm not really sure.
welcome back.

154
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:35,300
Thank you.

155
00:06:35,367 --> 00:06:36,767
Any other attacks?

156
00:06:36,834 --> 00:06:38,868
Um, no, not yet.

157
00:06:38,934 --> 00:06:40,133
Call's proven
hard to track.

158
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,601
He's never had
a driver's license,

159
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:43,200
So he's most likely
still on foot.

160
00:06:43,267 --> 00:06:44,200
Jj: or public
transportation.

161
00:06:44,267 --> 00:06:45,701
He's not gonna take the bus.

162
00:06:45,767 --> 00:06:46,801
His face is everywhere.

163
00:06:46,868 --> 00:06:48,067
Hotch: has anyone
found a stressor?

164
00:06:48,133 --> 00:06:49,567
He just lost his job.

165
00:06:49,634 --> 00:06:51,133
He's worked at a factory
since 1990.

166
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,267
Made appliances
since forever and not
a single promotion.

167
00:06:53,334 --> 00:06:55,501
That's a long time
to be bitter.

168
00:06:55,567 --> 00:06:56,767
Reid: or he doesn't care.

169
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:58,434
Not if he's got
a family to feed.

170
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,734
Garcia: actually,
he's of the hermit variety.

171
00:06:59,801 --> 00:07:01,133
As far as i can tell,
he's got no one.

172
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,100
No wife, no kids,
no parents.

173
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,667
Nothing to live for.

174
00:07:04,734 --> 00:07:06,133
So why hasn't
he killed himself yet?

175
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,634
Sprees usually end
in suicide.

176
00:07:08,701 --> 00:07:10,267
If he's got nothing
to live for,
why hasn't he ended it?

177
00:07:10,334 --> 00:07:11,434
'cause he isn't finished yet.

178
00:07:11,501 --> 00:07:12,767
We know he has displaced anger.

179
00:07:12,834 --> 00:07:14,601
He took it out
on the first victim.

180
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:17,067
Well, the stock boy
represents someone.
we need to know who.

181
00:07:17,133 --> 00:07:18,167
Is he military?

182
00:07:18,234 --> 00:07:19,300
Negative.

183
00:07:19,367 --> 00:07:21,000
Well, he's lashing out
for a reason.

184
00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:23,467
This guy's got anger,
endless targets, and a gun,

185
00:07:23,534 --> 00:07:24,968
And he's just getting started.

The brain has corridors

191
00:08:15,934 --> 00:08:17,734
All right.

192
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,633
We've got checkpoints
at the state line

193
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,800
On both i-64 and i-65

194
00:08:23,867 --> 00:08:25,633
And within a 20-mile
radius of downtown.

195
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,401
We think he's still on foot.

196
00:08:27,968 --> 00:08:30,034
It's been just under
3 hours with an average
walking speed

197
00:08:30,101 --> 00:08:32,434
Of 2.5 miles per hour,
which rounds up

198
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,767
To an approximate
8-mile radius.

199
00:08:34,834 --> 00:08:36,667
Now, we've concentrated here.

200
00:08:36,734 --> 00:08:39,834
First responders
started a hard-target search

201
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,434
Of businesses and residences
within that 8 miles.

202
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,368
You're gonna join 'em.
you know what he looks like.

203
00:08:46,434 --> 00:08:48,368
Go find him.

204
00:08:48,434 --> 00:08:51,301
We dug up all we could
on darrin call.

205
00:08:51,368 --> 00:08:54,034
Even went to his apartment.
didn't find much.

206
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:55,734
We've got agents
over there now.

207
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,001
Don't worry,
we'll fill it in.

208
00:08:57,067 --> 00:08:58,533
What's your strategy?

209
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,434
We try to figure out
where he's headed next.

210
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,934
Huh. you got a crystal ball?

211
00:09:02,001 --> 00:09:04,167
Most spree killers are
outwardly aggressive.

212
00:09:04,234 --> 00:09:06,700
We've studied
call's behavior,
and he's defensive.

213
00:09:06,767 --> 00:09:10,500
Jj: first victim--stock boy.

214
00:09:13,533 --> 00:09:16,834
Boy, there's nothing
defensive about that.

215
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,001
Actually, there is.

216
00:09:18,067 --> 00:09:19,967
Call doesn't react
until he's touched.

217
00:09:20,034 --> 00:09:21,667
And that's what set him off?

218
00:09:21,734 --> 00:09:22,800
Happens every time.

219
00:09:22,867 --> 00:09:26,834
Contact, then stab,

220
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,101
Contact, stab.

221
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:31,567
So you're saying he didn't
mean to hurt these people.

222
00:09:31,633 --> 00:09:33,234
He didn't go in there
with a weapon.

223
00:09:33,301 --> 00:09:34,567
Well, now he's got 2.

224
00:09:34,633 --> 00:09:37,301
I just put his face
all over the news.

225
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,434
People are gonna stop him
themselves.

226
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,767
How soon can we have
a press conference?

227
00:09:40,834 --> 00:09:42,600
The camera crews
are out front.

228
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:44,700
Great. let me call hotch.

229
00:09:44,767 --> 00:09:46,167
Who's that?

230
00:09:46,234 --> 00:09:49,001
Our supervisor. he's at
the crime scene already.

231
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:51,934
What is it about this kid?

232
00:09:52,001 --> 00:09:53,734
Reid: that's what
we need to figure out.

233
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,934
Call's apartment
is 5 minutes from the pharmacy,

234
00:09:56,001 --> 00:09:57,401
But there's no sign

235
00:09:57,468 --> 00:09:58,667
That he came here
to wash off that blood.

236
00:09:58,734 --> 00:10:00,533
How's he still
on the street,
looking like that?

237
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,334
Maybe he's not.

238
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:04,834
Garcia said he's got nobody.
where would he go?

239
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,934
Call gets up, he makes his bed.

240
00:10:08,001 --> 00:10:09,934
We're sure
he wasn't military?

241
00:10:10,001 --> 00:10:11,767
It looks like one neat aspect.

242
00:10:11,834 --> 00:10:13,533
Maybe he was hospitalized.
i'll call garcia.

243
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,533
Then he's probably
got the same routine
every day.

244
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,867
Except today.

245
00:10:17,934 --> 00:10:19,967
He finished his cereal,
walked to the pharmacy,

246
00:10:20,034 --> 00:10:21,900
And killed 3 people.

247
00:10:22,934 --> 00:10:24,434
Why?

248
00:10:27,067 --> 00:10:30,267
Mr. call was always so quiet.

249
00:10:30,334 --> 00:10:32,468
He's been coming here for years.

250
00:10:32,533 --> 00:10:34,201
Morgan: had he ever had
a run-in with the stock boy?

251
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:35,767
John was new here.
i waved him over.

252
00:10:35,834 --> 00:10:38,301
I didn't know what else to do.
no one else was helping.

253
00:10:38,368 --> 00:10:40,633
He didn't turn violent
until you gave him
his prescription?

254
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,167
Well, it wasn't his.

255
00:10:42,234 --> 00:10:43,967
You handed him a bag.

256
00:10:44,034 --> 00:10:45,234
It was somebody else's.

257
00:10:45,301 --> 00:10:46,500
I just wanted him
to calm down.

258
00:10:46,567 --> 00:10:48,767
Jj's press conference
is in 5 minutes.

259
00:10:48,834 --> 00:10:50,334
Hotch, we might have
something else here.

260
00:10:50,401 --> 00:10:51,767
Why didn't you give him
his own medication?

261
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:53,301
Well, he didn't have
any refills left.

262
00:10:53,368 --> 00:10:54,368
For what?

263
00:10:54,434 --> 00:10:55,500
Uh, alprazolam.

264
00:10:55,567 --> 00:10:58,834
But, uh, he used to be on
thiothixene.

265
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,101
He was on
an antipsychotic?

266
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:03,334
Well, that's why i wanted him
to calm down.

267
00:11:03,401 --> 00:11:05,301
You said he used to be.
how long has he been
off of them?

268
00:11:05,368 --> 00:11:06,700
At least a month.

269
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:08,734
And when were you
gonna tell us this?

270
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,034
He's armed,
he's delusional.
who's his doctor?

271
00:11:11,101 --> 00:11:12,434
Uh...

272
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,967
I don't remember.
my computer.

273
00:11:15,034 --> 00:11:15,900
Hotch: great.

274
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:18,734
I'm sorry.
great.

275
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,001
Excuse us.

276
00:11:20,067 --> 00:11:21,234
Hotch.

277
00:11:21,301 --> 00:11:22,967
Call jj and tell her
about the meds.

278
00:11:23,034 --> 00:11:24,267
This is not her fault.

279
00:11:24,334 --> 00:11:26,567
Morgan, he's in a psychotic
break. it changes everything.

280
00:11:26,633 --> 00:11:28,334
You want to talk
about this?

281
00:11:28,401 --> 00:11:29,867
No! i want to find him.
garcia,

282
00:11:29,934 --> 00:11:32,001
He's been off his
antipsychotic for a month.

283
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:33,301
What else did you miss?

284
00:11:33,368 --> 00:11:35,600
I'm sorry, sir. i didn't get
his medical records yet, so--

285
00:11:35,667 --> 00:11:36,700
Well, find them.
find everything.

286
00:11:36,767 --> 00:11:37,700
Yes...

287
00:11:37,767 --> 00:11:39,401

293
00:12:08,401 --> 00:12:09,867
I need the pills.

294
00:12:09,934 --> 00:12:11,800
Darrin, what's wrong?

295
00:12:11,867 --> 00:12:12,900
What happened?

296
00:12:12,967 --> 00:12:15,134
He had a--a knife.

297
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:16,633
Who?

298
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,434
It's just like
in the nightmares. he--

00:12:22,434 --> 00:12:24,500
He's doing it again.

301
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:26,767
He can't hurt you.

302
00:12:26,834 --> 00:12:28,301
We talked about this.

303
00:12:28,368 --> 00:12:29,334
You want to remember.

304
00:12:29,401 --> 00:12:32,101
It's why you're off the pills.

305
00:12:32,167 --> 00:12:33,301
You said i would get better.

306
00:12:33,368 --> 00:12:34,633
You are.

307
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,867
Does it look like
i'm better?!

308
00:12:36,934 --> 00:12:38,334
Darrin. darrin.

309
00:12:38,401 --> 00:12:41,567
I gotta...make it stop.

310
00:12:44,267 --> 00:12:45,500
Make it stop!

311
00:12:45,567 --> 00:12:47,134
Just make it--make it...
darrin...

312
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:48,800
Calm down. that's it.
just look here.

313
00:12:48,867 --> 00:12:49,867
Make it--make it--

314
00:12:49,934 --> 00:12:51,101
Just breathe.

315
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:52,934
Take a breath.

316
00:12:53,001 --> 00:12:54,700
Prentiss: he was unarmed.
he didn't mean to hurt anyone.

317
00:12:54,767 --> 00:12:56,368
All he wanted
was his medication,

318
00:12:56,434 --> 00:12:57,633
But he didn't get it.

319
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,434
He needs help.

320
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,434
Who's call's doctor?

321
00:13:01,533 --> 00:13:03,867
State appointed psychiatrist
charles cipolla.

322
00:13:03,934 --> 00:13:04,800
Hotch and morgan
are on their way.

323
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:05,967
Where's his office?

324
00:13:06,034 --> 00:13:08,533
Camden and third.
cipolla's not picking up.

325
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,201
Gps says were 5 minutes away.

326
00:13:10,267 --> 00:13:13,134
Ok, rossi, we're 5 out.
tell mitchell
to meet us there.

Darrin?

330
00:13:18,734 --> 00:13:20,867
Uhh! no!

No! get it out!

00:13:23,267 --> 00:13:24,867
No!

00:13:24,934 --> 00:13:26,267
Darrin!
get it out!

334
00:13:26,334 --> 00:13:27,567
No, get it out!

335
00:13:28,368 --> 00:13:30,301
Can't get it--

336
00:13:30,368 --> 00:13:31,334
I can't get it out!

337
00:13:31,401 --> 00:13:32,401
I can't--gotta--

338
00:13:32,468 --> 00:13:34,234
I gotta get it out!
darrin--

339
00:13:34,301 --> 00:13:35,700
Darrin, darrin, here. here.

340
00:13:35,767 --> 00:13:37,834
Darrin! darrin, here.

341
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,934
Take my shirt.
just take it.

342
00:13:40,001 --> 00:13:43,034
There you go,
that's good.

343
00:13:43,101 --> 00:13:44,434
No! don't touch him!

344
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:49,500
No! oh, my god!

345
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:51,967
No! darrin, no! oh, my god!

00:14:18,834 --> 00:14:21,468
All right, get out of here
and check the perimeter.
do it now.

349
00:14:32,301 --> 00:14:34,201
We're too late.

350
00:14:36,468 --> 00:14:38,834
Hotch!

351
00:14:57,834 --> 00:15:00,001
He cleaned up,
changed his clothes,

352
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:02,433
Could have dyed his hair
for all i know.

353
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,600
Call's suffering from
a psychotic break.

354
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:06,467
He's not dodging us
on purpose.

355
00:15:06,534 --> 00:15:07,834
Oh, come on.

356
00:15:07,901 --> 00:15:08,934
Trust me.

357
00:15:09,001 --> 00:15:10,500
If he was psychotic,

358
00:15:10,567 --> 00:15:13,001
Why would his doctor
take him off the drugs?

359
00:15:13,067 --> 00:15:15,067
Call has no history
of violent behavior.

360
00:15:15,134 --> 00:15:18,101
Cipolla couldn't predict
that would happen.

361
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:19,234
Look at this place.

362
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,034
Yeah, it's a mess.
no, it's more than that.

363
00:15:21,101 --> 00:15:22,367
Call was looking for something.

364
00:15:22,433 --> 00:15:23,400
Yeah, the drugs.

365
00:15:23,467 --> 00:15:25,934
Doctor doesn't keep
the drugs here.

366
00:15:26,001 --> 00:15:27,834
Scrip pad is still
on his desk.

367
00:15:27,901 --> 00:15:29,268
My guess is he came here
for help.

368
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:30,667
His file's missing.

369
00:15:30,734 --> 00:15:33,734
[cell phone rings]

370
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:37,234
Yeah, baby girl,
what's going on?

371
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,734
Where's hotch?
he's not answering.

372
00:15:38,801 --> 00:15:40,367
He's outside.
he's all right.

373
00:15:40,433 --> 00:15:41,467
Are you sure?

374
00:15:41,534 --> 00:15:43,201
Yeah. what's up?

375
00:15:43,268 --> 00:15:44,201
A mystery.

376
00:15:44,268 --> 00:15:45,600
Come on,
not today, garcia.

377
00:15:45,667 --> 00:15:47,034
I know. here's the deal.

378
00:15:47,101 --> 00:15:49,333
When i missed
the antipsychotics--

379
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,034
Listen to me.
that was not your fault.

380
00:15:51,101 --> 00:15:53,134
You are ever my champion, sugar,

381
00:15:53,201 --> 00:15:54,834
But i believe it was.

382
00:15:54,901 --> 00:15:56,801
Anyway, when i did that,
i went back to the beginning

383
00:15:56,867 --> 00:15:59,333
For call, except there is
no beginning.

384
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,467
Wait a minute.

385
00:16:00,534 --> 00:16:01,634
Rossi.

386
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,634
Say that again.

387
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,034
What are you
talking about?

388
00:16:04,101 --> 00:16:07,534
Darrin call didn't exist
like from 1969 to 1975.

389
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,567
There's no birth certificate,
no social security,

390
00:16:09,634 --> 00:16:12,067
No identity, nothing,
until he was 6 years old.

391
00:16:12,134 --> 00:16:13,333
Was he abandoned?

392
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,333
My least 3 favorite words
strung together--

393
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,834
I don't know.

394
00:16:17,901 --> 00:16:19,801
My guess is
neither does he.

395
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,201
I should have seen
the blinking on the video.

396
00:16:30,268 --> 00:16:31,634
Well, it could have been
a nervous tic.

397
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,168
But it wasn't.
it's a classic sign

398
00:16:33,234 --> 00:16:35,234
Of long-term antipsychotic use,
and i missed it.

399
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,034
We all did.

400
00:16:37,101 --> 00:16:38,834
Well, regardless,
those men died.

401
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,034
Garcia's got something.

402
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:45,534
May 1, 1975,
a 6-year-old darrin call

403
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,967
Was found roaming
in the middle of nowhere
and was picked up

404
00:16:48,034 --> 00:16:50,634
And was in state care
for the first few months.

405
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,067
Did he tell the cops
what happened?

406
00:16:52,134 --> 00:16:53,967
No. because he didn't talk,

407
00:16:54,034 --> 00:16:55,467
Not for over a year.
and once he started talking,

408
00:16:55,534 --> 00:16:57,168
He only knew his life
as darrin call.

409
00:16:57,234 --> 00:16:59,234
That's awful.

410
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,967
So is this. little darrin
was never claimed.

411
00:17:01,034 --> 00:17:02,467
Jj: maybe he wasn't
from the area.

412
00:17:02,534 --> 00:17:06,134
There wasn't a thriving
missing children's network
in 1975.

413
00:17:12,168 --> 00:17:14,767
Call is wearing
cipolla's clothing.

414
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:16,067
You think he's lucid?

415
00:17:16,134 --> 00:17:17,834
No, mostly likely
he's just freaked out.

416
00:17:17,901 --> 00:17:19,667
Either way, we should
update the public.

417
00:17:19,734 --> 00:17:21,101
You should
be there, too.

418
00:17:21,168 --> 00:17:23,367
What is this?

419
00:17:23,433 --> 00:17:25,001
Call's timeline.
he left louisville?

420
00:17:25,067 --> 00:17:26,467
3 times.

421
00:17:26,534 --> 00:17:28,867
Always came back
to the same 10-block radius.

422
00:17:28,934 --> 00:17:31,001
Why?

423
00:17:31,067 --> 00:17:32,500
Victims are often drawn
to the scene of
their first trauma.

424
00:17:32,567 --> 00:17:34,001
Part of him
wanted to escape,

425
00:17:34,067 --> 00:17:35,967
The other part probably
struggled to find answers.

426
00:17:36,034 --> 00:17:37,500
Was he hospitalized?

427
00:17:37,567 --> 00:17:40,067
Uh, 1985 for 2 years.

428
00:17:40,134 --> 00:17:42,433
Garcia: yeah. and again
in '95 for a few months,

429
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,001
Both at the state facility
in fayette county.

430
00:17:44,067 --> 00:17:45,367
You know he doesn't drive.

431
00:17:45,433 --> 00:17:47,901
You think he'd walk
all the way out there?

432
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:50,268
He's desperate.
he'll find a way.

433
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:53,001
Well, then i'll tell
the sheriff in fayette.

434
00:17:53,067 --> 00:17:54,467
When did he start
the prescriptions, garcia?

435
00:17:54,534 --> 00:17:56,400
In 1977, and it looks like
he tried them all.

436
00:17:56,467 --> 00:17:57,667
I've got a list.

437
00:17:57,734 --> 00:17:58,834
Alphabetically, alprazolam,

438
00:17:58,901 --> 00:18:00,268
Clonazepam, diazepam--

439
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,201
Just send it.
yes, sir.

440
00:18:02,268 --> 00:18:03,901
His doctor weaned him off
the prescription for a reason.

441
00:18:03,967 --> 00:18:06,934
Now, that's a big risk,
so the reward
must have been greater.

442
00:18:07,001 --> 00:18:08,634
Prentiss:
he needs the truth.

443
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,067
He took his file.

444
00:18:10,134 --> 00:18:11,168
He's got some answers.

445
00:18:11,234 --> 00:18:12,367
And a head start.

446
00:18:12,433 --> 00:18:14,834
Well, we need to catch up.

447
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,634
[screaming]

448
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,268
[indistinct chatter]

449
00:18:44,067 --> 00:18:45,534
Jj: records from child services

450
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,001
Has him extremely
physically abused.

451
00:18:48,067 --> 00:18:49,268
No signs of sexual assault.

452
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:50,667
Garcia: that's a miracle.

453
00:18:50,734 --> 00:18:52,901
Either way, the trauma
was debilitating.

454
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:55,168
Was he running from
an abusive home
or an abduction?

455
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:58,034
Wouldn't there be a paper trail
if it were a kidnapping?

456
00:18:58,101 --> 00:19:01,534
Garcia, look for unsolved
missing children's cases
from the 1970s.

457
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,333
Now, there was a case

458
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,934
In hollow creek.
kids were dead, though.

459
00:19:06,001 --> 00:19:06,967
Found them in pieces.

460
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:08,801
When was this?
'75.

461
00:19:08,867 --> 00:19:11,634
Nobody talks about it
'cause they never
found the guy.

462
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,934
You think call
walked away from that?

463
00:19:14,001 --> 00:19:15,567
It's possible.

464
00:19:15,634 --> 00:19:16,934
Garcia, send me everything.

465
00:19:17,001 --> 00:19:18,600
Done.

466
00:19:20,667 --> 00:19:21,867
Can you find the case file?

467
00:19:21,934 --> 00:19:23,400
I'll do what i can.

468
00:19:32,268 --> 00:19:35,168
[groaning]

469
00:19:41,201 --> 00:19:42,433
Boy: you're it!

470
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,834
Second boy:
come on, wait up!

471
00:19:43,901 --> 00:19:46,134
[kids chattering]

472
00:19:49,034 --> 00:19:51,268
Is there a suspect list?

473
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:52,801
It's in here somewhere.

474
00:19:52,867 --> 00:19:54,534
Reid: he was known as
the hollow creek killer.

475
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,634
3 bodies were found,
some never identified.

476
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,834
Oh, god, he used lime
to dispose--

477
00:20:00,901 --> 00:20:02,168
There's a survivor.
call?

478
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:03,767
No, a 12-year-old boy
named tommy phillips.

479
00:20:03,834 --> 00:20:06,034
Parents said he'd been
missing for 2 weeks,

480
00:20:06,101 --> 00:20:07,534
Came back a different kid.

481
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,500
Of course he did.

482
00:20:08,567 --> 00:20:09,734
Let's see. the family
left louisville

483
00:20:09,801 --> 00:20:11,767
After tommy told police
where to find the bodies.

484
00:20:11,834 --> 00:20:15,400
He also said the suspect
was a white man in his 30s

485
00:20:15,467 --> 00:20:17,467
And drove
a red pickup truck.

486
00:20:17,534 --> 00:20:18,934
We need to find tommy.

487
00:20:19,001 --> 00:20:20,268
He'd be 46 now.

488
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:21,834
His parents probably
changed his name

489
00:20:21,901 --> 00:20:23,067
And got as far away
as possible.

490
00:20:23,134 --> 00:20:24,268
Garcia can find him.

491
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:25,467
Don't get your hopes up.

492
00:20:25,534 --> 00:20:26,634
Garcia,
everything you can find

493
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,634
On a tommy phillips.

494
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,567
Reid: the victims had cuts.

495
00:20:28,634 --> 00:20:30,101
The stock boy's blade

496
00:20:30,168 --> 00:20:31,801
Is what set him off
in the pharmacy.

497
00:20:31,867 --> 00:20:33,101
If this is what call's
been running from,

498
00:20:33,168 --> 00:20:34,767
It's no wonder
he's blocked it out.

499
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:36,400
Since he's clean now,
there's no medication

500
00:20:36,467 --> 00:20:38,567
To block his memories
and he wants answers.

501
00:20:38,634 --> 00:20:40,734
Where would he go?

502
00:20:43,901 --> 00:20:45,168
To what he knows.

503
00:20:45,234 --> 00:20:46,634
He doesn't know anything.

504
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,734
That's the problem.

505
00:20:47,801 --> 00:20:50,967
He's beginning to.
1975, sterner orphanage.

506
00:20:51,034 --> 00:20:53,934
It's where he became
darrin call.

507
00:20:54,001 --> 00:20:56,367
[knocking on door]

508
00:20:56,433 --> 00:20:58,567
[knocking]

509
00:21:01,834 --> 00:21:03,367
Yes?

510
00:21:03,433 --> 00:21:06,367
There was a nice man
here, mr. cureton.

511
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:07,734
I need to see him.

512
00:21:07,801 --> 00:21:09,500
I'm sorry,
he retired years ago.

513
00:21:09,567 --> 00:21:10,834
Well, where did he go?

514
00:21:10,901 --> 00:21:12,767
I don't know. i'm sorry--
you gotta know! he--

515
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,034
He didn't just leave.

516
00:21:16,101 --> 00:21:20,034
I'm sorry, sir,
but i told you,
he's not here.

517
00:21:20,101 --> 00:21:21,234
Come on, kids, homework!

518
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,634
Come on.

519
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,700
Come on.

520
00:21:24,767 --> 00:21:28,500
Would you please leave?
the children are coming in.
please.

521
00:21:28,567 --> 00:21:30,801
Come on. come on.
straight to the books.

522
00:21:30,867 --> 00:21:34,134
Right to it.
straight to the back
and we'll sit down.

523
00:21:44,867 --> 00:21:47,168
He's here.

524
00:21:47,234 --> 00:21:49,534
He's here.

525
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,600
Who?

526
00:21:50,667 --> 00:21:51,600
What are you
talking about?

527
00:21:51,667 --> 00:21:53,300
Nobody's here.
he's here.

528
00:21:53,367 --> 00:21:54,667
I just--

529
00:21:54,734 --> 00:21:56,801
Oh, careful, ryan.

530
00:21:57,967 --> 00:21:59,201
Come on, you can make it!

531
00:21:59,268 --> 00:22:01,067
Come on! come on, come on!

532
00:22:01,134 --> 00:22:03,101
Tommy, tommy,

533
00:22:03,168 --> 00:22:04,600
We gotta go.

534
00:22:04,667 --> 00:22:06,101
Stop it!
no, wait--

535
00:22:06,168 --> 00:22:07,634
Stop it! stop it!
aah!

536
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,634
Stop it!
aah!

537
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,934
Come on, tommy.

538
00:22:11,001 --> 00:22:13,767
Go, go!
somebody help!

539
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:14,934
Somebody!

540
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:16,600
Go, go!

541
00:22:19,433 --> 00:22:20,967
Thank you.

542
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,367
He called the boy tommy.

543
00:22:27,433 --> 00:22:28,767
Is that
what set him off?

544
00:22:28,834 --> 00:22:30,867
She thought it was
his reflection.

545
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:32,934
Whoever hurt him
years ago

546
00:22:33,001 --> 00:22:34,367
Might have been
the same age he is now.

547
00:22:34,433 --> 00:22:35,467
He might have seen
the similarity.

548
00:22:35,534 --> 00:22:36,934
What about the boy?

549
00:22:37,001 --> 00:22:38,067
His real name is ryan.

550
00:22:38,134 --> 00:22:39,534
She said he's quiet
and submissive.

551
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,901
Is morgan
getting anything

552
00:22:40,967 --> 00:22:41,901
Out of the other witness?

553
00:22:41,967 --> 00:22:43,034
Not yet.

554
00:22:43,101 --> 00:22:46,534
A minivan was stolen
one block from here.

555
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,300
Call's never driven
in his life.

556
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,134
You think he's still
not running from us?

557
00:22:50,201 --> 00:22:52,034
Which way?

558
00:22:52,101 --> 00:22:53,534
Eastbound. i got roadblocks
set up everywhere.

559
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,500
He's not getting out
of this county.

560
00:22:55,567 --> 00:22:57,801
You're wasting your time.

561
00:22:58,567 --> 00:22:59,734
He's outnumbered.

562
00:22:59,801 --> 00:23:01,801
You think he's gonna
just disappear?

563
00:23:01,867 --> 00:23:04,534
I think he took
the boy for a reason.

564
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,934
I don't care why he took him.

565
00:23:07,001 --> 00:23:08,101
You should.

566
00:23:08,168 --> 00:23:10,300
Call's memory
is no longer suppressed.

567
00:23:10,367 --> 00:23:11,667
He's reinventing his past,

568
00:23:11,734 --> 00:23:13,134
And unless
we understand how,

569
00:23:13,201 --> 00:23:14,600
We're not gonna find
either of them.

570
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:17,400
Well, i'm not gonna
just sit around and speculate.

571
00:23:17,467 --> 00:23:19,067
Then don't.

572
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,834
You don't think
we should chase him either?

573
00:23:24,901 --> 00:23:26,901
We need to get ahead
of call.

574
00:23:34,367 --> 00:23:36,134
There's a kid missing.

575
00:23:36,201 --> 00:23:38,168
They don't need
the extra manpower.

576
00:23:38,234 --> 00:23:39,234
Since when?

577
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,500
If we'd studied
foyet's initial crimes,

578
00:23:41,567 --> 00:23:45,101
We would have known
that a survivor
didn't make sense.

579
00:23:45,168 --> 00:23:46,734
What does he have
to do with this?

580
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:50,333
All we had to do was stop
and look at foyet's history,

581
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,234
And we didn't, and we lost
two couples and a bus
full of people.

582
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,400
And i'm not making
that mistake again.

583
00:24:00,834 --> 00:24:02,600
Ryan: they're gonna find us.

584
00:24:02,667 --> 00:24:03,767
Where? you saw 'em?
where?

585
00:24:03,834 --> 00:24:04,700
Who?

586
00:24:04,767 --> 00:24:05,901
Where did you seem 'em?

587
00:24:05,967 --> 00:24:08,034
Who?
where did you see 'em?! where?!

588
00:24:08,101 --> 00:24:10,268
Please, just let me go.

589
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:12,333
I'm sorry, tommy.

590
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,433
Just--

591
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,600
We just gotta--
we gotta--

592
00:24:15,667 --> 00:24:17,333
Just--ohh--we gotta--

593
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,834
We gotta hurry, tommy,

594
00:24:18,901 --> 00:24:21,268
'cause he's gonna get us
and we just--

595
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:24,801
We just gotta--uhh--
[groans]

596
00:24:24,867 --> 00:24:26,001
So what do we know?

597
00:24:26,067 --> 00:24:28,268
There were only 4 suspects
in the hollow creek case

598
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:29,467
And they're all dead.

599
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:32,667
The kids were taken
in 1973, '74, and '75.

600
00:24:32,734 --> 00:24:34,433
And all on the way
home from school.

601
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,667
Different school districts.

602
00:24:35,734 --> 00:24:37,067
He waited for them
to be alone.

603
00:24:37,134 --> 00:24:38,168
That takes patience.

604
00:24:38,234 --> 00:24:40,001
He must have had time off
in the afternoons.

605
00:24:40,067 --> 00:24:41,300
He lived or worked
near the schools.

606
00:24:41,367 --> 00:24:43,634
That's a lot of doors
to knock on.

607
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,034
You think call's
going back there?

608
00:24:45,101 --> 00:24:46,134
I think there's
a good chance.

609
00:24:46,201 --> 00:24:47,467
I'll tell mitchell.

610
00:24:47,534 --> 00:24:49,400
Where's the secondary
location?

611
00:24:49,467 --> 00:24:51,467
He needed seclusion
to do what he did.

612
00:24:51,534 --> 00:24:52,567
[beep]

613
00:24:52,634 --> 00:24:54,300
Go ahead, garcia.
you're on speaker.

614
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:56,967
I found tommy. he goes by
james thomas anderson now.

615
00:24:57,034 --> 00:24:58,700
Is he local?

616
00:24:58,767 --> 00:25:00,534
One county over. address
and bio are coming...now.

617
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,367
Hotch: thanks, garcia.

618
00:25:02,433 --> 00:25:04,967
What does darrin call
have to do with me?

619
00:25:05,034 --> 00:25:08,700
We think he survived
the hollow creek murders.

620
00:25:08,767 --> 00:25:10,734
Nobody survived that.

621
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:13,067
You did.

622
00:25:13,134 --> 00:25:15,700
There was another boy.

623
00:25:15,767 --> 00:25:17,034
He was 6.

624
00:25:17,101 --> 00:25:18,400
No, that's not true.

625
00:25:18,467 --> 00:25:19,467
We don't have time for this.

626
00:25:19,534 --> 00:25:22,967
I'm telling you,
i was alone.

627
00:25:23,034 --> 00:25:25,901
Just like now?

628
00:25:25,967 --> 00:25:27,333
Excuse me?

629
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,134
Have you ever been married?

630
00:25:29,201 --> 00:25:31,667
Any relationships?
any family?

631
00:25:31,734 --> 00:25:33,400
What does that have
to do with anything?

632
00:25:33,467 --> 00:25:36,333
Or are you afraid
you'll abandon them, too?

633
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,400
Or was it because of
your alcoholism?

634
00:25:38,467 --> 00:25:40,567
I would never leave a kid.

635
00:25:40,634 --> 00:25:43,168
Did he cry too much?

636
00:25:43,234 --> 00:25:44,967
Was he too slow?
what was it?

637
00:25:45,034 --> 00:25:47,367
How could you leave
a 6-year-old all alone?

638
00:25:55,967 --> 00:25:58,500
I was only 12 years old.

639
00:25:59,834 --> 00:26:02,801
He's been taking medications
to deal with the trauma

640
00:26:02,867 --> 00:26:04,634
That suppressed
his memories.

641
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:08,901
That kind of amnesia
is a psychological defense.

642
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:12,067
He's gonna wish
he never remembered.

643
00:26:12,134 --> 00:26:14,268
We know what you told
the police.

644
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:17,034
We need to know
about the boy.

645
00:26:19,367 --> 00:26:21,634
He never talked.

646
00:26:24,201 --> 00:26:26,734
Hey! hey, kid.

647
00:26:26,801 --> 00:26:29,600
Hey, kid.

648
00:26:29,667 --> 00:26:33,001
Is the old man
passed out yet?

649
00:26:37,734 --> 00:26:40,001
Can you reach those?

650
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,534
Good. good. good.

651
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,168
Good.

652
00:26:49,234 --> 00:26:51,168
Ok. bring 'em. please.

653
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:52,667
Bring 'em here.

654
00:26:52,734 --> 00:26:55,300
Go ahead, you can do it.

655
00:26:55,367 --> 00:26:57,634
Right there. good.

656
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,333
Ok.

657
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,400
Ok.

658
00:27:03,734 --> 00:27:05,967
Come on. come on!

659
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,001
Come here.

660
00:27:12,067 --> 00:27:13,967
Grab the shovel.

661
00:27:26,901 --> 00:27:29,333
Hey, come here!

662
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,333
[groaning]

663
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,433
Quit struggling!

664
00:27:33,867 --> 00:27:36,333
Come here.

665
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,500
Get out of there.

666
00:27:38,567 --> 00:27:39,534
Go on!

667
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,333
Uhh!

668
00:27:42,967 --> 00:27:44,734
Ah!

669
00:27:47,134 --> 00:27:48,634
Come on.

670
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,300
Come on!

671
00:27:53,867 --> 00:27:56,367
Come on, you can make it!

672
00:27:56,433 --> 00:27:59,168
[grunting]

673
00:28:00,433 --> 00:28:02,367
Come on, you can make it!

674
00:28:02,433 --> 00:28:03,367
Come on!

675
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:04,634
Come on!

676
00:28:05,801 --> 00:28:07,934
Aah! go, tommy! run!

677
00:28:08,001 --> 00:28:10,201
Go, tommy! run!

678
00:28:10,268 --> 00:28:12,234
Go, tommy! run!

679
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,967
I'd never heard
his voice before.

680
00:28:15,034 --> 00:28:17,834
He told you to go.

681
00:28:20,168 --> 00:28:22,168
He was a kid.

682
00:28:23,367 --> 00:28:25,168
So were you.

683
00:28:25,234 --> 00:28:28,168
Call wasn't in
the back with you.

684
00:28:30,567 --> 00:28:34,101
No, he was in the cab.

685
00:28:34,168 --> 00:28:35,600
He gave you water.

686
00:28:35,667 --> 00:28:37,168
Got the keys.

687
00:28:37,234 --> 00:28:39,834
Why wasn't he locked up?

688
00:28:39,901 --> 00:28:43,001
Maybe call
wasn't a victim.

689
00:28:45,001 --> 00:28:47,600
Call's reflection.

690
00:28:47,667 --> 00:28:49,967
Oh, god.

691
00:28:50,034 --> 00:28:53,300
His father was
the hollow creek killer.

692
00:28:55,134 --> 00:28:56,934
His own kid?

693
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:59,300
No wonder
he was never claimed.

694
00:28:59,367 --> 00:29:01,500
How did the father explain
his son just disappeared?

695
00:29:01,567 --> 00:29:02,767
Could have said
he ran away.

696
00:29:02,834 --> 00:29:04,801
The mother would have
reported him missing.

697
00:29:04,867 --> 00:29:06,367
Maybe he said
the boy died.

698
00:29:06,433 --> 00:29:07,700
She'd want a funeral.

699
00:29:07,767 --> 00:29:08,934
What if there wasn't one?

700
00:29:09,001 --> 00:29:10,867
Morgan, call garcia.
ask her to check death records

701
00:29:10,934 --> 00:29:12,500
From 1969 to 1975.

702
00:29:12,567 --> 00:29:13,500
For who?

703
00:29:13,567 --> 00:29:14,801
For the mother.

704
00:29:14,867 --> 00:29:16,201
[breathing hard]

705
00:29:16,268 --> 00:29:17,201
[grunting]

706
00:29:17,268 --> 00:29:19,201
[grunting]

707
00:29:20,901 --> 00:29:23,134
[panting]

708
00:29:23,201 --> 00:29:25,333
Go, tommy! run!

709
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,934
Go, tommy, run!

710
00:29:28,001 --> 00:29:29,667
You think you can get away?!

711
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:30,700
Is that what you think?!

712
00:29:30,767 --> 00:29:32,134
You stupid little bastard.

713
00:29:32,201 --> 00:29:34,101
Uhh!

714
00:29:35,867 --> 00:29:38,001
[screaming]

715
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:40,001

717
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:44,967
Hey!

718
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:48,367
[grunting]

719
00:29:48,433 --> 00:29:49,867
Morgan: have you
narrowed it down?

720
00:29:49,934 --> 00:29:51,467
Oh, 6 years is a long time.
i need more parameters.

721
00:29:51,534 --> 00:29:54,034
She lived within
that 8-mile radius.

722
00:29:54,101 --> 00:29:56,001
She was married.
she was most likely
in her twenties.

723
00:29:56,067 --> 00:29:57,500
He was probably
her only kid.

724
00:29:57,567 --> 00:29:59,300
The husband drove
a red truck.

725
00:29:59,367 --> 00:30:00,934
Ok. this could be one.

726
00:30:01,001 --> 00:30:04,001
Here we go, doris jarvis.
died in childbirth.

727
00:30:04,067 --> 00:30:06,534
And let me guess--
she had a boy.

728
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,967
Yeah.

729
00:30:08,034 --> 00:30:09,834
Baby girl, i'm gonna
put you on speaker.

730
00:30:09,901 --> 00:30:10,901
Guys.

731
00:30:10,967 --> 00:30:12,201
Garcia: ok, so doris jarvis

732
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:13,700
Was married to bill jarvis.

733
00:30:13,767 --> 00:30:15,867
He owned a machine shop
just outside the city.

734
00:30:15,934 --> 00:30:17,667
That could be
the secondary location.

735
00:30:17,734 --> 00:30:19,634
It closed in 1980.

736
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,867
He hasn't done anything since.
i guess he laid low.

737
00:30:21,934 --> 00:30:25,101
He had a red pickup until 1976
when he bought a black one.

738
00:30:25,168 --> 00:30:26,867
I know that because
that's what he was driving

739
00:30:26,934 --> 00:30:28,034
When he was arrested for duis.

740
00:30:28,101 --> 00:30:29,967
He was locked up
from '77 to '80,

741
00:30:30,034 --> 00:30:32,168
And i'm sending
his picture now.

742
00:30:33,901 --> 00:30:36,801
And that could certainly
be darrin call's father.

743
00:30:36,867 --> 00:30:38,201
Where's jarvis now?

744
00:30:38,268 --> 00:30:40,767
In the same house.
1457 hitchens avenue.

745
00:30:40,834 --> 00:30:42,400
Let's go.

[crowd cheering on tv]

748
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:12,901
...that's gonna do it.

749
00:31:12,967 --> 00:31:15,034
There's no energy
shortage here.

750
00:31:15,101 --> 00:31:18,300
His third shot
of the 1975 season.

751
00:31:18,367 --> 00:31:19,967
We'd like to remind you--

752
00:31:20,034 --> 00:31:22,667
You're late.

Patterson still walking
around the mound.

755
00:31:29,201 --> 00:31:32,967
We're not quite sure
what is happening.

756
00:31:33,034 --> 00:31:35,067
[announcer continues]

757
00:31:35,134 --> 00:31:37,367
[crowd cheering on tv]

758
00:31:37,433 --> 00:31:40,367
He's behind
the count now,

759
00:31:40,433 --> 00:31:42,201
Three balls, one strike,

760
00:31:42,268 --> 00:31:43,400
With a man on first
and second

761
00:31:43,467 --> 00:31:44,534
Here in the bottom
of the eighth.

762
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,634
I knew you'd come home.

763
00:32:06,567 --> 00:32:07,534
Lieutenant.

764
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,500
The kid's in there.
we've got this.

765
00:32:09,567 --> 00:32:11,500
Tactical teams
are covering the exits.

766
00:32:11,567 --> 00:32:13,367
Call needs a distraction.

767
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:14,634
He's focused on the old man.

768
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,400
For now. but we're gonna
have to figure out

769
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:17,767
The safest way
to get that kid out.

770
00:32:17,834 --> 00:32:19,901
I've got a team in the back
and one on the way.

771
00:32:19,967 --> 00:32:21,534
We're going to infiltrate.

772
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,034
You do that
and someone else dies.

773
00:32:23,101 --> 00:32:25,400
Either call
or a child murderer--

774
00:32:25,467 --> 00:32:26,433
Flip a coin.

775
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,867
It doesn't have to end
like that.

776
00:32:27,934 --> 00:32:29,534
We get a confession
out of jarvis
and he goes away,

777
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,867
And call gets
his answers.

778
00:32:30,934 --> 00:32:32,534
No one else has to die.

779
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,567
Hotch.

780
00:32:33,634 --> 00:32:36,634
Hotch.

781
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,034
Hotch!

782
00:32:38,101 --> 00:32:39,168
What the hell is he doing?!

783
00:32:39,234 --> 00:32:40,234
Let him go.

784
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,834
Rossi, i'm not letting him
go in there solo.

785
00:32:41,901 --> 00:32:44,101
We have to trust him.

786
00:32:48,201 --> 00:32:51,001
We can do this together.

787
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,767
[door opens]

788
00:32:57,067 --> 00:32:58,001
[door closes]

789
00:32:58,067 --> 00:32:59,367
Get out!

790
00:32:59,433 --> 00:33:00,667
My name's aaron.

791
00:33:00,734 --> 00:33:02,734
This is between us and him.

792
00:33:02,801 --> 00:33:05,168
I know.

793
00:33:05,234 --> 00:33:06,700
Then you leave us alone.

794
00:33:06,767 --> 00:33:09,734
I know what he did
to those boys.

795
00:33:09,801 --> 00:33:12,500
I know about hollow creek
and the cage.

796
00:33:12,567 --> 00:33:14,500
And tommy.

797
00:33:14,567 --> 00:33:17,168
You know about tommy?

798
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:25,034
Come on, you can make it!

799
00:33:25,101 --> 00:33:26,433
Come on!
come on!

800
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:31,101
We're gonna get him back
for everything
that he done, tommy.

801
00:33:31,168 --> 00:33:32,901
Every single thing.

802
00:33:32,967 --> 00:33:35,867
Let him go. tommy
doesn't need to see this.

803
00:33:35,934 --> 00:33:37,268
He should die.

804
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:40,400
He should.
but if you kill him,

805
00:33:40,467 --> 00:33:44,101
You have nothing,
and i thought
you wanted some answers.

806
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,534
What's he doing?

807
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,400
Stalling.

808
00:33:49,467 --> 00:33:51,600
He's got nothing to lose.

809
00:33:51,667 --> 00:33:53,467
Go ahead, darrin,
ask him.

810
00:33:53,534 --> 00:33:55,268
[whimpers]

811
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:57,934
Why did you do that
to those kids?

812
00:33:58,001 --> 00:33:58,934
What kids?

813
00:33:59,001 --> 00:34:00,101
No!

814
00:34:00,168 --> 00:34:03,567
The ones that
we buried. why?!

815
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,967
You're confused.

816
00:34:06,034 --> 00:34:07,300
No! unh!

817
00:34:07,367 --> 00:34:10,067
Jarvis, why didn't you move?

818
00:34:10,134 --> 00:34:12,901
This is my home.

819
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:14,934
You sure it's not the view?

820
00:34:15,001 --> 00:34:16,268
Darrin, come here.

821
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:18,567
Come take a look at this.

822
00:34:25,734 --> 00:34:27,567
He sits on the porch every day
and watches those kids.

823
00:34:27,634 --> 00:34:29,600
He can't help himself.

824
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:31,168
You got the shot?

825
00:34:33,867 --> 00:34:36,834
Man on police radio:
negative.

826
00:34:36,901 --> 00:34:37,934
Damn it.

827
00:34:38,001 --> 00:34:39,734
What's he doing?

828
00:34:42,234 --> 00:34:44,168
Man on police radio:
bringing the boy out.

829
00:34:47,667 --> 00:34:49,567
Let's get hotch out of there.

830
00:34:49,634 --> 00:34:51,600
That's his call.

831
00:34:53,268 --> 00:34:56,967
We--we drove around
in that truck.

832
00:34:57,034 --> 00:34:58,767
[panting]

833
00:34:58,834 --> 00:35:00,134
You made your own son

834
00:35:00,201 --> 00:35:02,367
Sit in front so the other
boys would feel safe?

835
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:06,067
You--you kept them
in cages.

836
00:35:06,134 --> 00:35:08,600
I burnt their clothes.

837
00:35:08,667 --> 00:35:09,834
And when you finished,
you'd bury them

838
00:35:09,901 --> 00:35:12,467
And you made him help.

839
00:35:12,534 --> 00:35:13,433
And--

840
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,300
Get up.
pretend you're a man.

841
00:35:16,367 --> 00:35:18,168
You like little boys,
don't you?

842
00:35:18,234 --> 00:35:19,600
But they can't be
too small,

843
00:35:19,667 --> 00:35:21,168
'cause that would be wrong.

844
00:35:21,234 --> 00:35:23,500
What was it about them?
they make you feel strong,

845
00:35:23,567 --> 00:35:25,500
Make you feel like a man?

846
00:35:25,567 --> 00:35:27,001
You shut up.

847
00:35:27,067 --> 00:35:29,967
Is that a yes?

848
00:35:33,234 --> 00:35:34,067
Darrin.
please--

849
00:35:34,134 --> 00:35:36,333
Please.
we're surrounded here.

850
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,901
The police are gonna
storm in here any minute.

851
00:35:37,967 --> 00:35:40,168
They will not shoot you
if you are unarmed.

852
00:35:40,234 --> 00:35:41,734
You need to put
the gun down now.

853
00:35:41,801 --> 00:35:43,268
Don't--don't--

854
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:46,067
Tell me what to do!

855
00:35:46,134 --> 00:35:49,333
Uhh! don't--uhh--

[gunshots]

857
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:53,834
Go, go!

858
00:36:03,067 --> 00:36:04,433
What happened?

859
00:36:05,433 --> 00:36:07,400
I couldn't stop him.

860
00:36:14,101 --> 00:36:15,867
Rossi: it's over.

861
00:36:15,934 --> 00:36:18,300
For now.

862
00:36:21,967 --> 00:36:24,134
[indistinct chatter]

863
00:36:26,867 --> 00:36:28,367
Thank you.

864
00:36:32,834 --> 00:36:35,734
There's someone
i think you should talk to.

865
00:36:53,534 --> 00:36:55,168
Hey.

866
00:36:57,834 --> 00:37:00,300
Tommy?

867
00:37:01,367 --> 00:37:03,834
I'm so sorry.

868
00:37:06,367 --> 00:37:08,567
What for?

869
00:37:08,634 --> 00:37:11,634
For running away.

870
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,134
We both ran.

871
00:37:13,201 --> 00:37:14,834
Yeah, but i left you behind.

872
00:37:14,901 --> 00:37:17,400
He could have killed you.

873
00:37:17,467 --> 00:37:19,634
He didn't.

874
00:37:20,667 --> 00:37:23,433
'cause i wasn't afraid
of him anymore.

875
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,767
You've changed
everything, tommy.

876
00:37:25,834 --> 00:37:29,433
You're the one
that i waited for.

877
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,201
You're the one
that saved me.

878
00:37:48,168 --> 00:37:50,700

so dreadful,

"no accuser so terrible,

881
00:38:09,367 --> 00:38:12,967

[knocks]

884
00:38:20,201 --> 00:38:21,500
Hey.

885
00:38:21,567 --> 00:38:24,101
I know what you want
to talk about.

886
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:28,168
2 months ago we wouldn't
be breaking down
hotch's decisions.

887
00:38:28,234 --> 00:38:30,500
There'd be no doubt.

888
00:38:30,567 --> 00:38:33,534
2 months ago he had everything
to live for, rossi.

889
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,201
Now his family's
just been taken away.

890
00:38:36,268 --> 00:38:38,700
How is he supposed to think
about anything else?

891
00:38:38,767 --> 00:38:41,901
How long is he gonna
let foyet win? hmm?

892
00:38:41,967 --> 00:38:44,067
I mean, come on,
by the time we catch this guy,

893
00:38:44,134 --> 00:38:46,767
Hotch could be more scarred
on the inside than he is
the outside.

894
00:38:46,834 --> 00:38:47,901
Hotch took a risk.

895
00:38:47,967 --> 00:38:50,034
But we saved that boy.

896
00:38:50,101 --> 00:38:52,067
He put his life at risk
in there,

897
00:38:52,134 --> 00:38:54,867
In ways that we are never
supposed to, and you know it.

898
00:38:54,934 --> 00:38:58,667
I'm not about to stand by
and watch this man kill himself.

899
00:38:58,734 --> 00:39:01,867
And you won't.

900
00:39:01,934 --> 00:39:03,134
Rossi...

901
00:39:03,201 --> 00:39:04,567
If hotch is gone,

902
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:08,268
Foyet's got no one else
to torture. hotch wins.

903
00:39:08,333 --> 00:39:12,467
But if hotch lives
but doesn't get to watch
his son grow up,

904
00:39:12,534 --> 00:39:14,767
Hotch loses.

905
00:39:19,367 --> 00:39:22,567
[alarm beeping]

906
00:39:22,634 --> 00:39:25,101
You didn't have to walk
me up here, you know.

907
00:39:25,168 --> 00:39:26,101
I know.

908
00:39:26,168 --> 00:39:28,767
[resets alarm]

909
00:39:28,834 --> 00:39:31,234
So you think call's
gonna be ok?

910
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,934
I don't know.

911
00:39:33,001 --> 00:39:35,234
He got his answers.

912
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,333
He killed the man
who haunted him.

913
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,634
And what else is there?

914
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:43,134
The years of torture.

915
00:39:44,834 --> 00:39:47,134
Think he'll get over that?

916
00:39:47,201 --> 00:39:48,767
How could he?

917
00:39:48,834 --> 00:39:51,867
But at least he doesn't
have to feel like
he's alone anymore.

918
00:39:51,934 --> 00:39:54,600
He doesn't have anyone.

919
00:39:55,901 --> 00:39:58,433
He has tommy.

920
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,834
He's not alone.

921
00:40:06,268 --> 00:40:07,667
Get some sleep.

922
00:40:07,734 --> 00:40:09,867
You, too.

923
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:39,367
[sighs]

924
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:46,400
