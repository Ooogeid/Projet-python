1
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,800
there's a basement.

2
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,300
damn.

3
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,700
damn.

4
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,500
you sure it's him?

5
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,000
who else could it be?

6
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,300
i just want
to make sure.

7
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,400
male. approximately
6 years old. i'm sorry.

8
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,500
there's something in here.

9
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,700
what's that baby doing here?

10
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,800
j.j. can't let her baby
be at a crime scene.

11
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,800
reid.

12
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,800
j.j.

13
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,200
reid.

14
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,500
sorry, i was dreaming.

15
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,800
ha, no kidding.

16
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,500
we found a 6-year-old
boy who had been abused and stabbed.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,200
your baby was
at the crime scene.

18
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,900
i was trying to get him
out of there.

19
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,600
sorry.

20
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:33,900
it's ok.

21
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,300
you know, reid,
simple dream analysis--

22
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,700
if there's a baby in your dreams,
that baby's actually you.

23
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,000
i don't believe in
dream analysis.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,200
i don't know.
it makes sense.

25
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,300
the case we're working on and the case in your dream 
both involve children.

26
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,000
maybe your subconscious is
telling you you want to sit this one out.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,800
i don't.

28
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,100
well, maybe you're just stressed out
about going home to las vegas.

29
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,900
did you tell your mom
you're coming?

30
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,500
why aren't we reviewing
the case file?

31
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,100
i don't know. maybe because
someone fell asleep on the jet.

32
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,700
all right, let's start
from the beginning one more time.

33
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,800
this is ethan hayes.
he was 5.

34
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,400
2 weeks ago he was abducted
out of his own front yard.

35
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,400
where were the parents?

36
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,200
his mom just ran inside
to grab her purse.

37
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,500
when she came back,
he was gone.

38
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,600
she wasn't away for more
than a minute or 2.

39
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,900
police found his body
exactly one week later in the desert.

40
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,700
he was in a new change
of clothes.

41
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,800
his nails clipped.
his hair was combed.

42
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,000
that's a lot of remorse.

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
no sign of sexual assault.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,200
the medical report suggests
he was smothered.

45
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,700
unsub could see this death
as merciful.

46
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,900
who's the new boy?

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,400
michael bridges.

48
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,000
yesterday, he set out to walk by himself
to a friend's house a block away 
and he never showed up.

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,900
are we sure these cases are
even connected?

50
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,600
the unsub called
each of the families.

51
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,300
but no ransom demand.

52
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,100
it was more like taunts.

53
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,200
he's telling them
it's their fault that their child was taken.

54
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,400
ok. so, we have an unsub who shows remorse 
and then projects his own guilt onto the victims' parents.

55
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,600
and if we're lucky, 6 days to find the boy
before he is killed.

jennifer jareau.

63
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,900
this is aaron hotchner.

64
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,800
thanks for getting here
so quick.

65
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,000
morning.
what can you tell us?

66
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,600
we've got an amber alert
in effect.

67
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,000
tip line's being run through
the precinct.

68
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,300
his photo's on the wire.

69
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,600
has the phone company been
served with a caller subscription subpoena?

70
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,200
yeah. we'll get a name and location 
if he's calling from a land line.

71
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,100
we'll also run the calls
through our analyst at quantico.

72
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,600
she can triangulate
cell calls.

73
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,700
we need to clear the area
of official vehicles.

74
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,600
if the unsub happens to drive by,
i don't want him to panic ???

75
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,800
ok. i'll clear 'em out after
we make introductions.

76
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,400
how are they
handling it?

77
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,100
separate.

78
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,300
craig, amy bridges,
these are agents jareau and hotchner from the fbi.

79
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,400
we just want to say how sorry we are 
for what you're going through

80
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,100
but we're here to do whatever we can 
to try and get michael home.

81
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,400
i'm going to tell you
what i told the police.

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,600
i don't want to know
what happened to that other boy.

83
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,900
i just want to hear how you're going to find michael.

84
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,100
we understand.

85
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,400
no, you don't.

86
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,100
you're right.

87
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,100
i don't know exactly
what you're going through.

88
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,200
but i do know these cases.

89
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,500
and we're gonna need your help.

90
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,900
of course. we know that.

91
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,300
was it normal for michael
to walk to a friend's house by himself?

92
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,200
what are you saying?

93
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,300
it's just a question.

94
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,300
no it's not.

95
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,200
do you think we had
something to do with this?

96
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,200
no. i don't.

97
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,500
if this was his routine, someone could have 
been watching him for some time now.

98
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,200
he'd only done it
a couple times.

99
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,100
amy and i had
a fight about it.

100
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,500
i thought
we were babying him.

101
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,200
i don't want him
crawling into bed with us anymore.

102
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,100
and i thought he should be able to walk 
to a friend's house by himself, alone.

103
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,800
he was really proud
of himself the first time he did it.

104
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,000
excuse me.

105
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,400
i'm sorry.

106
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,900
it's like she can't engage
in what's going on.

107
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,200
it's all right.
everybody deals with it differently.

108
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,900
i need to know what happened
to that other boy.

109
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,200
there was no bruising
around his neck or face.

110
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,600
i'm guessing
he used a pillow.

111
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,900
was there any sign
of a struggle?

112
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,300
no, but he would have
been extremely weak.

113
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,300
why's that?

114
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,500
this is where it gets weird.
he was noticeably thin.

115
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,000
and both his stomach and intestines were
completely empty.

116
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,300
he was being starved?

117
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,500
it seems that way.

118
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,700
ok. so,
what's the weird part?

119
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,500
i wanted to determine
if malnutrition played a part in his death.

120
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,900
so, i looked for evidence
of starvation ketosis

121
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,700
by analyzing some vitreous humor--
the squishy part OF THE EYEBALL

122
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,900
and i couldn't find
any ketone bodies there.

123
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:33,700
meaning?

124
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,500
he was getting
nutrients somehow.

125
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,400
through an i.v.?

126
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,800
there were no marks
to indicate that.

127
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,200
any idea
what else could it be?

128
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,300
honestly, i have no idea.

129
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,700
CRIME SCENE DO NOT CROSS

130
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,700
not exactly
a well-preserved scene.

131
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,600
it's the crime scene
investigators.

132
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,000
they all want to play cop instead of just being
scientists--

133
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
and they end up trampling
on everything.

134
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,800
so, he suffocates the boy at another location,
prepares the body,

135
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,800
takes him out to the middle
of nowhere and dumps him.

136
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,200
except there were no traces of the unsub's sweat
on the boy's clothing.

137
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:05,900
what are you getting at?

138
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,800
well, it's like 1,000 degrees
out here.

139
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,000
if he carried the body,
then he would have gotten
traces of sweat on the clothes.

140
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,300
so, he wraps him
in something.

141
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,700
no fibers.

142
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,300
so, he took the time to change the boy's clothing 
and groom him ONCE HE GOT HERE.

143
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,200
if he took that much time,
he'd have to do it at night.

144
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,300
but you still run the risk of someone recalling your
car once the body's found.

145
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,000
not if you didn't have
to park it by the road.

146
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,600
well, you'd want to park a distance away from the dump site

147
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,300
just in case someone saw the car 
and came to see what you were up to.

148
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,800
now, tell me this.

149
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,300
<i>if you can drive out
into the desert to dump a body,</i>

150
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,200
why not go in deeper, where you 
won't be seen from the road?

151
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,000
because he wanted to be able to drive by and see the body.

152
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,300
that's why he groomed him.

153
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,300
it's like he was preparing him
for a funeral.

154
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,400
yeah. i got it.

155
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,900
thank you.

156
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,600
detective, the funeral for the first victim is tomorrow.

157
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,400
do you feel comfortable asking the family
if they'd be willing to open THE SERVICE UP TO THE PUBLIC?

158
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,600
- why's that? - we feel if they do, 
there's a good chance the unsub will come.

159
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,800
i'll go speak to them.

160
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,200
craig, we'd like you and your wife to consider
being there as well.

161
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,400
good. anything.

162
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,000
i think you should talk
to amy about it.

163
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,400
if it might help,
there's nothing to discuss.

164
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,800
i understand. but, please,
just...discuss it with her.

165
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,400
when the police asked
for a picture of michael,

166
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,500
i couldn't decide
what to give them.

167
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,900
i didn't know if it was
right for him to be smiling.

168
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,000
any choice you made
would have been right.

169
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,600
my husband doesn't know
what to do with himself.

170
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,200
he thinks we should be
out there looking for him.

171
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,900
the best thing for you right now 
is to just let us guide you through this.

172
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,200
he thinks i blame him.

173
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,100
i'm sure that's not true.

174
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,100
he's right.

175
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,700
my son's been taken.

176
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,700
i'm completely frozen.

177
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,800
and now i'm blaming
my husband.

178
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,200
i feel like a monster.

179
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,100
when they need you,
you'll come through.

180
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,700
you don't even know me.

181
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,500
call it intuition.

182
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,200
i found it when i came into his room,
after he'd been taken.

183
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,800
we don't let him eat in bed.

184
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,000
i haven't moved it
because...

185
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
i don't want him to think he's in trouble
for breaking the rules.

186
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,700
you know what you're having?

187
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,300
it's--it's a boy.

188
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,700
congratulations.

189
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,100
- garcia, you ready?
- ready.

190
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,800
mr. bridges, let's go back
over what we discussed.

191
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,200
- he's got my son.
- exactly.

192
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,400
just stay positive.
i've written down some important phrases--

193
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,500
we need to answer the phone.

194
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,600
mr. bridges, please.

195
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,700
i think amy should do this.

196
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,000
she doesn't want to do this.

197
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,200
no. i don't.

198
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,400
it's our experience that the parent that's
least emotional is best.

199
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,900
amy, you'll be great.

200
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,100
just try to humanize michael
at every opportunity.

201
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,800
he needs to see him
as a person.

202
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,600
try to keep him on the line as long
as you possibly can.

203
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,200
the more he talks,
the more he'll reveal about himself.

204
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,500
hello.

205
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,700
are you alone?

206
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,100
um, my husband is with me.

207
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,400
why are you just sitting at home
when you should be out looking for your boy?

208
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,600
you're right.
we need to do that.

209
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,800
he's better off with me.

210
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,600
thank you for calling us
to let us know michael's all right.

211
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,500
i didn't say
he was all right.

212
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,900
i know. i'm--i'm just
trusting that he's ok.

213
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,800
he's in a better place now.

214
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,400
may i speak with michael?

215
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,900
he doesn't want
to talk to you.

216
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,000
he knows what a bad mother
you are.

217
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,600
your 3 minutes are up.

218
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,300
garcia, anything?

219
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,900
it looks to be
a disposable cell phone.

220
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,600
i couldn't triangulate the call. 
but it did bounce off not one but 2 towers.

221
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,900
- meaning?
- i know he's mobile.

222
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,600
and i know he's moving
within the las vegas limits.

223
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,200
he didn't travel
outside the city.

224
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,400
it's just a start.

225
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,400
like i said, the more he talks,
the more we'll learn about him.

226
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,600
these are agents
morgan and reid.

227
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,900
they'll be here all night
just in case he calls back.

228
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,800
i need to lie down.

229
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,100
of course.

230
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,000
you should go with her.

231
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,400
yeah.

232
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,300
what'd you find out
from the medical examiner?

233
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,200
we think that
he's starving them.

234
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,800
but that doesn't fit with the care he takes
with the bodies.

235
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,600
starvation would be
a form of torture.

236
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,900
there's no sexual assault.

237
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,300
the torture could be
a substitute for the sex act.

238
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,700
i'll coordinate
with rossi and prentiss.

239
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,200
we'll call you
if there's anything new.

240
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,900
couldn't find any evidence
of forced entry.

241
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,200
why would that matter?

242
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,300
'cause it means he most likely knew
his attacker.

243
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,500
reid?

244
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,500
get 'em off. morgan!
get 'em off! get 'em off!

245
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,700
morgan, get 'em off me!
get 'em off me!

246
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,800
get 'em off me!

247
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,400
get 'em--
morgan, get 'em off me!

248
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,100
reid. reid. wake up.

249
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:37,900
it's morgan.

250
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,100
what the hell's going on?

251
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,800
sir, ma'am.
everything's ok.

252
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,000
you wake us up screaming,
you think everything's ok?

253
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,100
i understand we startled you.
and i'm sorry for that.

254
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,400
you're the f.b.i.

255
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,600
you're right.
i'm really sorry.

256
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,200
sir, please, go back upstairs 
and try to get some rest.

257
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,500
it was just
a misunderstanding.

258
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,700
everything is fine,
i promise you that.

259
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,900
are you ok?

260
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,600
it was a dream.
i'm really sorry.

261
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,400
was it about michael?

262
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,900
no.

263
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,600
i've been afraid
to close my eyes.

264
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,000
i'm scared i'll see him die.

265
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,800
ma'am, i know it's hard.

266
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,500
but i need you to go upstairs 
and try to get some sleep.

267
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,900
please.

268
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,000
i am sorry
for the disturbance.

269
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,400
i'm making everything worse.

270
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,000
reid...

271
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,100
these cases get to all of us.

272
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,500
i'm losing it
in their living room.

273
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,800
and i'm dreaming--

274
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,900
i'm dreaming about dead kids
and covered in leeches.

275
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,700
what the hell is scaring you?

276
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,400
this boy's gonna die
and there's nothing i can do to stop it.

277
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,600
i can't do this.
i'm sorry.

278
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,000
what are you doing?

279
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,300
i'm not going to the funeral.

280
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,300
we talked about this.

281
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,200
no, you talked. i listened.

282
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,700
please, tell her
this is our only chance.

283
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,400
we feel like
it's a viable plan.

284
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,600
 you're asking us to go to
the funeral of a 5-year-old boy.

285
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,900
we're going to watch them
lower his body into the ground.

286
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,500
<i>and the same man
who killed him has our son.</i>

287
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,000
if the man who took michael is there,
your presence MIGHT JUST STARTLE HIM.

288
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
we're looking for anything that
might draw him out.

289
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,100
i can't watch them bury
a child knowing that we're next.

290
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,800
we feel like this plan
has a reasonable chance SUCCESS.

291
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:18,500
what do you consider a reasonable chance 
that i will ever see my son again? 10%? 20?

292
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,000
i can't give you numbers.

293
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,700
you could.

294
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,900
i understand
if you can't do this.

295
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,800
but if you can, we need to talk about 
who we're looking for.

296
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,700
we believe the man
we're looking for is white.

297
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,900
he's probably in his
late 20s to mid-30s.

298
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,900
judging by the quality of the clothing he put
his first victim in,

299
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,200
we believe he comes from
a middle-class background.

300
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:43,600
this is not someone who is going to be 
at the funeral in a high-end or well tailored suit.

301
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,200
he also might be paying
a lot of attention

302
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,700
to the parents of the most
recent boy to be abducted.

303
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:51,700
<i>watch for anyone whose focus 
is on them instead of the service itself.</i>

304
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,800
we also believe he may drive
a 4-wheel-drive vehicle.

305
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,700
pay extra attention
to those mourners.

306
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,300
and memorize license plates.

307
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:01,200
this unsub dumped his last
body far from the city.

308
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,300
and yet,
he didn't try to hide it.

309
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,400
in fact, it was close enough
to be seen from the road.

310
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,600
that tells us he's trying
to separate his actions from himself.

311
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,400
yet, he wanted to be able
to drive out and visit the body.

312
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,400
this is about remorse.

313
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,500
which is why we believe
there's a good chance he'll be there today.

314
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,400
ok. if you sense someone looking
at you you need to tell us.

315
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,600
we're conditioned
to feel fear.

316
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,000
the little hairs
on the back of your neck?

317
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,900
they tell us the truth.

318
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,900
j.j. will stay here.
if the phone rings,

319
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,400
she'll say she's a family friend and
that you're at a funeral.

320
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,900
you can do this.

321
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,900
hey, kid,
we're almost ready to go.

322
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,200
you know, they're right.

323
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:01,500
odds are we'll catch the unsub when he dumps the body 
or when he tries to snatch another kid.

324
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,700
i know the odds, reid.

325
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,500
it's weird.

326
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,200
some things never go away.

327
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,900
when i was a kid,
every boy i knew had piles of dinosaur toys.

328
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,000
not you?

329
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,900
i had books and notebooks.

330
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:24,000
my mom filled hundreds of them 
with poems by w.s. merwin,
BY BOB DYLAN.

331
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,200
she liked it
when i memorized them.

332
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,900
she was convinced that they were watching us 
and writing songs ABOUT THEIR WIVES.

333
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,300
basements are the first part
of a house to be built, right?

334
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,900
so if you're having recurring dream
about a basement,

335
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,100
kinda speaks to the core
fundamentals of who you are as a person.

336
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,100
i thought you didn't believe
in dream analysis.

337
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,900
freud's been discredited
but jung still has his merits.

338
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,700
my dream. the dead boy.

339
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,600
i've been having different versions of it
since i was a little kid.

340
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,300
hey.

341
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,900
you know, nobody would think less of you
if you took a little time off ???

342
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,500
i just want
to find this boy.

343
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,100
there's a very full
crowd here today,

344
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:29,200
which i believe is part of the natural outpouring of grief
over losing someone so innocent.

345
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:35,700
it is also a reminder that there
is another boy out there
who is in danger

346
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,900
AND HIM NEED OF OUR PRAYERS.

347
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,500
let's take a moment
and pray for that boy.

348
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,400
for his safe return.

349
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,100
he's here.

350
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,600
why aren't you helping me?

351
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,200
spencer, pay attention.

352
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,300
reid.

353
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,600
what's going on?

354
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,700
i've been here before.

355
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,600
in the name
of the father, son,
holy ghost. amen.

356
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,700
let us take comfort in the gospel
according to matthew.

357
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,300
chapter 18.

358
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:59,000
"at that time, the disciples
came to jesus and asked,

359
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,800
"who is the greatest
in the kingdom of heaven?

360
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,600
"he called a child,
whom he put among them and said,

361
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,700
"'truly i tell you,

362
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,600
"'unless you change
and become like children,

363
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,600
"'you will never enter
the kingdom of heaven.

364
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,600
whoever becomes humble...'"

365
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,500
are you a friend
of the family?

366
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,700
uh, no.

367
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:25,200
i just read about it IN THE PAPER.

368
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,800
and you decided
to come to the funeral?

369
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
yeah. it was sad.

370
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,800
i love kids.

371
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,400
i wanted the family
to know that people care.

372
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
and videotaping it?
who's that for?

373
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,300
we're gonna take a walk.

374
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,500
and we're gonna do it
very quietly so as not
to disturb these people.

375
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:02,500
where were you on the days ethan hayes and
michael bridges were abducted?

376
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,700
i was home.

377
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:07,000
don't you need to ask
what days those were?

378
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,300
am i under arrest?

379
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,700
no. you love kids.

380
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,800
you're just helping us
with an investigation.

381
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,200
so, you have no right
to search me.

382
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,900
why? what would we find?

383
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:22,200
oh, do you like videotaping other things
besides funerals?

384
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,100
how's it going?

385
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,400
he's nervous.

386
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,700
they're trying
to pin him down.

387
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:33,900
what's that?

388
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,400
you mind giving us a minute?

389
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,600
no, sure.

390
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,600
i had one of the detectives
pull it.

391
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,600
the name riley jenkins
mean anything to you?

392
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,200
no.

393
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,000
think.

394
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,500
back to when
you were a little boy.

395
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,600
i had an imaginary friend
named riley when i was little.

396
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,900
riley jenkins.

397
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,500
he was murdered right here in las vegas
when he was 6 years old.

398
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,100
my math says that you would have been
around 4 at the time.

399
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,700
he was found him in the basement of his own house, 
behind the dryer.

400
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,900
he'd been sexually abused
and stabbed.

401
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,800
where can we find
michael bridges?

402
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,300
you are trying to frame me.

403
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,100
you killed ethan hayes,
and you're holding michael bridges.

404
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:29,500
no.

405
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,700
<i>then why were you
videotaping a funeral?</i>

406
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
does death excite you?

407
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,100
oh, wait. that's it.
death gets you off.

408
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,600
i told you, i don't touch.

409
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,200
no. you just kill 'em and find new ways
to watch him afterwards.

410
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,100
i am not sick.

411
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,100
i think you are.

412
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,600
and i think you
desperately want to tell us

413
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,300
exactly how sick
you really are, walter? don't you?

414
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,400
you want us to search
your computer and your home

415
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,200
because this is eating
you up inside

416
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,600
and you know you need
to be stopped.

417
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,700
i never would have
molested that boy!

418
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,300
which boy?

419
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,000
the one from the funeral.

420
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,900
hotchner.

421
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,600
he doesn't know details
of the murder.

422
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,100
you sure?

423
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,800
he assumes the boy was
molested.

424
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,900
all right. thanks.

425
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,700
he's not the one.
i'm sorry.

426
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,900
you said it looked good.

427
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,400
i was hopeful. i'm sorry.

428
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,500
but he was videotaping
that funeral.

429
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,100
we believe he's
a preferential sex offender.

430
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,700
but he doesn't have michael.

431
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,700
how many of these people
are out there?

432
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,100
more than you want to know.

433
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,200
hello.

434
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,800
put the fbi on.

435
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,600
i don't know
what you're talking about.

436
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,300
i saw them there
at the funeral.

437
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,700
put them on!

438
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,300
this is special agent
aaron hotchner.

439
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,700
you were trying to trick me.

440
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,100
you were trying to lock me down 
but you arrested the wrong person.

441
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,800
why don't we just
slow down and talk.

442
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,700
we only have 3 minutes.

443
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,800
no. we have
as long as we want.

444
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,600
that's not the rules.

445
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,300
ok. you're right.
your rules.

446
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,400
it was good of you to go
to the funeral today.

447
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,100
you must have really
cared about ethan.

448
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,800
i loved him.
his parents didn't deserve him.

449
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,500
i took good care of him.

450
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,700
is that why you bought
him the new clothes?

451
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,800
they put him in those silly blue sneakers
and lime green oxford.

452
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,300
he hated those!

453
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:18,100
well, maybe when you're
good enough to bring michael home,

454
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,800
you can tell his parents
what he really likes.

455
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,500
no. he's never coming home.

456
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,700
i saw that so-called mother.
she looked right at me.

457
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,900
she knows he sleeps
better with me.

458
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,600
i don't know who you are.

459
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,300
but please give me back
my son! please.

460
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,900
i'm begging you.
i'll do anything.

461
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,200
just don't hurt my baby.
please!

462
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,200
your time is up.

463
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,100
you were trying to trick me.

464
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,300
no one was trying
to trick you.

465
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:02,600
you were trying to lock me down
but you arrested the wrong person.

466
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,300
would it be possible for us 
to work in private for a while?

467
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,500
he was at the funeral.

468
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,000
i told you.

469
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,100
he was at the funeral,
and you arrested the wrong man.

470
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,500
i don't think
it is a man.

471
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,900
did you hear the way
she described the clothing?

472
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,600
she said the blue shoes.
lime green oxford.

473
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,600
a male wouldn't reference
specific details like that.

474
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,600
i think reid's right.

475
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,400
she talked about
what the child wanted.

476
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,500
how he slept.
how she took care of him.

477
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,600
she said, "i loved him."

478
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,700
a male unsub would have
emphasized the competition, not the care giving.

479
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,200
he would have talked
about how he was smarter than the f.b.i.

480
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,800
bragged about not being caught.

481
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:38,500
- we could have been looking at both men and women--
- the statistics are overwhelming.

482
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,200
women abduct newborns.
men take children.

483
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,000
garcia.

484
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,900
i'm right here, sir.

485
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,300
will you run the license plates
the police gave you

486
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,400
and find any that might be
registered to a woman.

487
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:48,800
that would be...

488
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,500
PARAMETERS:REGISTRANT = FEMALE

489
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:49,600
MATCHING RESULTS: 0

490
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,700
MATCHING RESULTS: 0
zero.

491
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,600
how's that possible?

492
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,700
transcript almost reads like she's been
institutionalized.

493
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,700
you mean she's crazy.

494
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,700
she described herself
as being "locked down"

495
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,600
not "arrested"
or "put away."

496
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:04,000
plus, most mental facilities
are very rigid about the amount of phone ???

497
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,400
i think her talking about only having 3 minutes
isn't her rule to us.

498
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,100
it's what she's been institutionalized
to think of as normal.

499
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:15,400
garcia, can you get records of women released 
from mental institutions this past month?

500
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,800
she most likely has some
trauma in her case file--

501
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,600
possibly the death of a child.

502
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,500
i'm sorry. i can't do that.

503
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,700
to protect patient privilege
there's no central database.

504
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,700
i could hack
each hospital individually,

505
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,300
but even then,
most diagnoses are kept separately BY THE DIFFERENT DOCTORS.

506
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,600
i think
i might have a way.

507
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,200
dr. reid.

508
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,800
your mom didn't tell me
you were in town.

509
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,800
she doesn't know i'm here.
i'm working on a case.

510
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,700
and i actually thought
you might be able to help us.

511
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,600
of course.

512
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,100
you've read about the recent
child murder and second abduction?

513
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:49,800
yes.

514
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,600
we think the person
responsible is a woman.

515
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,000
she would have been
institutionalized.

516
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,400
but we believe she may have been released
within the past few weeks,

517
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,100
just before the first abduction.

518
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,200
what can i do?

519
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,600
i'm assuming you have a good working relationship 
with the administrators at other hospitals.

520
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,000
i know no one can open their files.

521
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,400
but if you wouldn't mind
just giving them the profile,

522
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,900
that would be a tremendous help.

523
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,900
she's delusional.
fueled by grief.

524
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:13,600
very well might have lost a child of her own, 
probably around the age of 5.

525
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,000
i'll see what i can do.

526
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,300
spencer?

527
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,000
what are you doing here?

528
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,700
i'm here for work.

529
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:34,700
we're investigating the murder and abduction
of two 5-year-old boys.

530
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:39,300
<i>i don't like the idea of you working on things
that are so sad.</i>

531
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,300
i know.

532
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,800
you're so thin.

533
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,700
i was going to come see you the second
we solved the case.

534
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,600
what else is going on
in there?

535
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,200
nothing.

536
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,200
don't lie to your mother,
spencer.

537
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:55,700
we know.

538
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,300
we feel things.

539
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,800
try to remember the moment when
you felt someone's eyes on you.

540
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,800
i don't know.

541
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:11,900
yes, you do.

542
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,800
at one point you said,
"he's here."

543
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,200
when was that?

544
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,200
it's her.

545
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,000
garcia, the blonde in the middle.
do you have her?

546
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,000
got her.

547
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,600
isolate the image.
run it through vicap.
see if we get a hit.

548
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,500
on it.

549
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,100
did i know a boy
named riley jenkins?

550
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,000
riley jenkins...

551
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,700
he was a story you made up.

552
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:50,700
no. no. he was a real kid who was murdered
when i was 4 years old.

553
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,500
oh, i think you're mistaken.

554
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,500
i've been seeing things.

555
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,400
don't say that.

556
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,700
i've been having dreams about his death
since i was little, mom.

557
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,500
you were always a reader.
it affected your dreams.

558
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,800
i remember, when i was 4,
we went to a funeral.

559
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,700
your uncle daniel's, maybe?

560
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,500
i also remember
we moved houses.

561
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,100
and you and dad
argued about it.

562
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,300
and you told dad
that i was in danger.

563
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,400
because you were.

564
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,000
why--why did you think that?

565
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:25,800
i don't know. i just knew.
i told you. a mother knows.

566
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,700
we're animals, spencer.
we feel things.

567
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,700
i'm sorry. i talked to the heads of
9 different hospitals.

568
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,200
there's no one who matches
your description.

569
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,900
thank you for trying.

570
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,800
you know, if this person has
an axis-1 condition,

571
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:43,900
her release wouldn't be as important as 
whether or not she keeps to her medications.

572
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,300
all right. thank you.
again, thank you very much.

573
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,600
i went off my medication
when i was pregnant with you.

574
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,700
i spent every day in terror,
but i made it.

575
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,700
and it was beautiful.

576
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,400
i had you.

577
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,600
oh, god.

578
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,400
what is it, baby?

579
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,600
women abduct newborns.

580
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,800
excuse me.

581
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,400
i don't understand.

582
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,400
doctor, would it be possible for a woman to convince herself

583
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,500
that a random 5-year-old child's actually her own newborn?

584
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,700
if her psychosis is strong enough.

585
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:24,400
and, again, if they'd stopped 
taking their medication, absolutely.

586
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,000
thank you. thanks.

587
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:35,000
hotch, i'm pretty sure i know why 
the medical examiner was so confused.

588
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,600
i think she's
breastfeeding them.

589
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,000
mommy's here.

590
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,600
there we go.

591
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,800
there ya go.

592
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,600
mommy's here.

593
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,900
get some sleep now, ok?
mommy's here.

594
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,900
i got a hit off the woman
on the video.

595
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,800
i ran it through vicap.
her name's claire bates.

596
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,700
she was institutionalized 3 years ago

597
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,800
after she assaulted a fellow
secretary at a law firm.

598
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,600
by that i mean,
she bit off part of her ear.

599
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,800
do we have an address?

600
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,000
there's no last known.

601
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,600
try running
the license plates again.

602
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,800

GARCIA, PULL HER BIRTH RECORDS.
 IF SHE'S REALLY BREASTFEEDING THEM,

609
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,300
then she must
have just given birth.

610
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,600
here we go.
claire bates...

611
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,400
gave birth to a son 3 weeks ago.

612
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,700
gave birth to a son 3 weeks ago.
BIRTH RECORDS.

613
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,800
OFFICIAL NOTIFICATION :CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES 
INTERVENED WITH A COURT-ORDERED 
SEVEN-DAY EVALUATION,

FROM THE BIRTH MOTHER PERMANENTLY. (MORE INFO)

615
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,500
oh...

616
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,700
what is it, garcia?

617
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,200
social services removed the baby 
from her care after a 7-day evaluation.

618
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,400
that's why she holds
the boys for 7 days.

619
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,000
she's recreating
the loss of her baby.

620
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,200
but she's taking
5-year-olds.

621
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,000
her psychosis must be projecting her baby
 onto any children she can get access to.

622
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,700
garcia, can you read us
the social services report?

623
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:17,000
"while it is admirable that patient stayed off
anti-psychotic medication

624
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,300
"for the health of her fetus,

625
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:21,500
"we strongly believe that due to a history 
of violent and delusional behavior,

626
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,800
"there is a significant risk to the child 
if she is granted guardianship.

627
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,500
"therefore, the child shall be a ward of the state 
until such time a full-time guardian can be established."

628
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,800
is there an address?

629
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,300
2509 brookside avenue.

630
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,000
j.j. will stay here with you. 
we'll call with any updates.

631
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,500
tell reid where we're going.

632
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,000
watch yourselves.
if she's truly delusional,

633
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,800
she'll have moments of clarity
where she realizes what she's done.

634
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,000
morgan and i'll go
around back.

635
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,600
prentiss and i'll
take these doors.

636
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,400
claire!

637
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,200
stop, claire!

638
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,500
she's going out the back.

639
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,800
careful. she's got the boy!

640
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,600
hotch, we got her!

641
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,700
she's going to the garage!

642
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:12,200
claire, back away from the fire
and put him down.

643
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,700
my baby's dead.

644
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,100
no, he isn't.

645
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,100
he's being taken really good
care of by someone else.

646
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,600
just like you need to take
care of this boy.

647
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,400
i kept healthy.
i did good.

648
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,600
we know you did.

649
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,900
we just need you to step away
and put the boy down.

650
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,600
my baby's dead.

651
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,500
no. he isn't, claire.
let us prove it to you.

652
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,700
do you have
a clean shot of her?

653
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,100
she's not armed, rossi.

654
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,100
if he's still alive
and she drops him in the fire,

655
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,800
we may not be able to save him.

656
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,400
do you have a shot?

657
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,400
yes. i got one.

658
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
i've got michael!
i've got michael!

659
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,800
i got ya.

660
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,000
no, don't do it!

661
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,700
a doctor has to check him out,
but you can be with him
the whole time.

662
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:45,200
he should be able to be back
in his bed by tonight.

663
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,200
thank you.

664
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,100
thank you.

665
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,800
you're gonna be great.

666
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,700
i know.

667
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,500
you know, this is about as good a day 
as we're gonna get on this job.

668
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
i know.

669
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
and yet you're still thinking about a boy 
you're not even sure if you really knew.

670
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,700
when i was 4, my mother had a sense 
that i was in danger.

671
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,500
reid,
your mother wasn't well.

672
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,800
i know facts about the case.

673
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,500
reid, you've got a photographic memory.

674
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,200
odds are, you saw the story.

675
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,000
he was just a kid like you.

676
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,800
and it caught your imagination.

677
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,300
i don't really think that you believe that.

678
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,200
you wanna know what i really believe?

679
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,300
i believe you could have done anything 
in the world with your life

680
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,100
and you chose
to do this job.

681
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,900
your man carl jung says our unconscious
 is the key to our life's pursuits.

682
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,400
yeah. yeah.

683
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,000
so, for whatever reason,

684
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,500
that case was stuck in your
brain all these years

685
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:03,200
and it not only led you
to this career choice

686
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,100
but to the same city
where your mother lives

687
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,700
and for us to have the opportunity to save this child.

688
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:11,900
yeah.

689
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:16,300
like i said, this is about as good a day
as we're gonna get, man.

690
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,700
enjoy your moment.

691
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:28,700
hotch, do you think it would be possible 
to wait until tomorrow to return home?

692
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,400
do you think you could find something to do 
in las vegas for the night?

693
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,300
bob dylan once said,

694
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:46,700
"i think the truly natural things are dreams, 
which nature can't touch with decay."

695
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,900
i'm proud of you, spencer.

696
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,100
for what?

697
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,500
saving that boy.

698
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,400
how'd you know?

699
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,600
i told you. a mother knows.

700
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:01,500
dr. norman gave me permission 
to sleep on the couch in your room tonight

701
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,000
if it's all right with you.

702
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,700
if anyone tries to keep him
in here any longer,

703
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,500
i'll scratch your eyes out.

704
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,000
one night only.

705
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,000
it helps if they think
you're crazy.

706
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,500
they don't argue.

707
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:27,700
Bob Dylan "Shelter From the Storm"

708
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,000
* 'twas in another lifetime *

709
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
* one of toil and blood *

710
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,600
* when blackness was a virtue,
the road was full of mud *

711
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:41,000
* i came in from the wilderness,
a creature void of form *

712
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:46,800
* "come in," she said, "i'll give you shelter from the storm." *

713
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,900
* and if i pass this way again *

714
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:58,000
* you can rest assured *

715
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,900
* i'll always do my best
for her *

716
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:02,300
* on that i give my word *

717
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,300
* in a world of steel-eyed
death and men *

718
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,700
* who are fighting to be warm *

719
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:11,500
* "come in," she said, "i'll give you shelter from the storm." *

720
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,000
* not a word was spoke
between us *

721
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,800
* there was little risk
involved *

722
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:25,200
* everything up to that point
had been left unresolved *

723
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,800
* try imagining a place *

724
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,000
* where it's always
safe and warm *

725
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,900
* "come in," she said, "i'll give you shelter from the storm." *

726
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:48,900
fbi.

727
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,900
put your hands in the air.

728
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,500
show me your face.

729
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,600
dad?

730
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,600
