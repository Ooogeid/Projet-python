00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:04,600
PHOENIX, ARIZONA

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,000
he's too damn old.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,480
overweight,
overpriced.

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,780
too damn old.

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,380
what, so you're saying
they should have kept Marion?

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,200
that's exactly
what i'm saying.

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,800
Marion, Nash,
Stoudemire.

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,400
well, that's a team.

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,200
yeah, same team that couldn't even make it past the first round.

10
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:29,980
what is it?

11
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,480
- where are we?
- what?

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,580
i'm asking you,
where are we?

13
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,400
i don't know. sixth and... buckeye?

14
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:40,780
wrong.

15
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,780
we were on sixth
8 blocks ago.

16
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,480
well, so what?
what are we doing back here?

17
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,380
we're learning.

18
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,700
now, where are we?

19
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:51,800
PHOENIX POLICE DEPARTMENT

20
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,300
i don't know.

21
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,880
you've got to know.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,300
you always, always
have got to know
where you are.

23
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,480
i mean, let's just say you jump out of
the car and run after some maggot.

24
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,780
this thing
can't help you.

25
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,500
back-up will wind up at the car 5 blocks away.

26
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,400
won't do you much good,
now will it?

27
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,480
no, sir.

28
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,200
don't sir me.
sir's for the academy.

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,080
i'm your partner.

30
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,100
yes, sir--uh, right.

31
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,580
four-fifteen frank,
4129 23rd avenue.

32
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:21,280
repeat, four-fifteen frank
in progress at 4129 23rd.

33
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,180
that's domestic
violence.

34
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:22,880
tell them
we're on it.

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,100
uh, copy that.

36
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,000
damn it.

37
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,380
- my flashlight.
- are you kidding me?

38
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,800
hurry up!

39
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,500
hold it!

40
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,300
oh, my god!
officer down,
officer down!

41
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,680
copy that, officer.
what's your 20?

42
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,500
we're at 23rd street!

43
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,300
officer?

44
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,180
back-up is on the way.

45
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,500
907--

46
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,880
all units,
4129 23rd avenue...

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,980
earlier this evening,
the phoenix police force lost two of our own.

48
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:29,800
sergeant manuel rodriguez
and officer thomas kayser
were killed IN THE LINE OF DUTY.

49
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,700
that's 3 officers
in the past 4 days.

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,880
after the first
shooting,

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,780
the phoenix police department assumed
gang involvement.

52
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,280
pretty reasonable
assumption.

53
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,880
true. almost 30% of all officer slayings
are gang related.

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,680
technically
it's closer to 40%.

55
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,780
if a cop isn't killed
during a commission of a crime,

56
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,580
gang involvement is highly likely.

57
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,253
actually, their precinct commander believes
it may be a serial

58
00:02:51,373 --> 00:02:52,685
and has asked for our help.

59
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:54,080
what makes him doubt the gang theory?

60
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,280
a couple of things.

61
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,180
last night's victims were killed exactly thme way as the first.

62
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,080
shot in the neck.

63
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,680
something that the press
didn't release.

64
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,080
well, now, wait.
there could still be
a gang behind this.

65
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,980
killers working together could
establish the same m.o.

66
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,280
commander marks
hasn't ruled it out,

67
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,880
- but there's another detail--
- trophies.

68
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,400
killer took their badges.

69
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,200
gang members
don't usually take trophies.

70
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,400
they don't need to.

71
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,580
this is an unsub
with something to prove.

72
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,700
and he's got
the entire city on edge.

73
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,280
kill those
who protect and serve,

74
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,900
and no one feels safe.

We are all brother under the skin.

80
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,600
and i for one would be willing
to skin humanity to prove it."

81
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
ayn rand.

82
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,800
go ahead, garcia.

83
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,080
ok, while you birds
have been in the air,

84
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,580
i got the 411
on the first shooting.

85
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,480
apparently,
every saturday night,

86
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,680
phoenix p.d. sets up
a dui checkpoint.

87
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,880
is that
common knowledge?

88
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,780
<i>mais, oui. public awareness
is part of the deterrent.</i>

89
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,880
so our unsub blows past
said checkpoint at 90 mph,

90
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,080
and is pursued by
a officer jason kessinger.

91
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,780
kessinger
pulls the car over,

92
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,380
approaches
the driver's side window,

93
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,300
where he is shot
in the throat.

94
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,700
<i>mon dieu.</i>

95
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,880
he was a single parent,
2 daughters.

96
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,680
so,
the unsub planned ahead,

97
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,880
used the dui stop
to set his trap,

98
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,080
and then lured the officer
to his death.

99
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,080
it could have been
personal.

100
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,180
the unsub might
have had a problem with these PARTICULAR OFFICERS.

101
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,480
or with law enforcement
in general.

102
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,580
he's sending a message.

103
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,660
criminals, gang members, academy washouts, SECURITY ???teenagers,

104
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,480
and that's just a start.

105
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,280
i mean, the list of people who have a problem with police officers IS A LONG ONE.

106
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,380
the victims were
shot in the neck,

107
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,080
so the unsub knew
they'd be wearing
body armor.

108
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,880
and he used
a dui checkpoint.

109
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,080
i mean, both incidents
show an active understanding of police procedure.

110
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,800
which narrows it down
to anybody who watches television.

111
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,180
we need to cover
victimology.

112
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,080
GARCIA, FIND OUT EVERYTHING YOU CAN
ABOUT THE OFFICERS KILLED

113
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,500
see what they had in common
besides their uniforms.

114
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,080
will do,
but i should warn you,

115
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,980
it will not be cake because i have been
on the phone WITH THESE GUYS ALL MORNING

116
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,080
and pulling files
from them has been like pulling molars.

117
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:49,980
is there a problem?

118
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,680
you know, aside from the obvious grief
for their fallen compadres,

119
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,480
and their fear of being used
as target practice,

120
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,180
i get the distinct impression
from their crabby behavior,

121
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,580
they are none too pleased their boss is outsourcing this investigation to the fbi,

122
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,900
so...be prepared to hit a blue wall of resistance.

123
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,700
18 CHANNEL NEWS PHOENIX

124
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,580
commander marks,
i'm ssa hotchner.

125
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,900
this is agent todd.

126
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,180
- hi.
- agents rossi,

127
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,980
prentiss, morgan,
and dr. spencer reid.

128
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,080
- thank you for inviting us.
- and thank you all for coming.

129
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,180
although i'd like to have a word
if you don't mind.

130
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,400
- of course. excuse me.
- uh, lieutenant evans.

131
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,580
lieutenant evans
will answer any questions
the rest of you may have.

132
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,900
i'll call you later.

133
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
this way.

134
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,900
sorry, that was
officer kayser's wife.

135
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,000
they'd only been married
a couple of months.

136
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,500
she seems to think
that the fbi is here
to save the day.

137
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,300
is that what
you're going to do, agents?

138
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,480
i apologize.

139
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,600
it turns out i may have
wasted your time.

140
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,280
ballistics came back.

141
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,880
both .357 magnums,
but not a match.

142
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,280
looks like we're talking
about 2 different shooters after all.

143
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,080
- we don't think so.
- really?

144
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,380
well, everyone here
is pretty convinced
this is A BEGINNING OF GANG WAR.

145
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,480
no, i understand that you could
see it that way,

146
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,780
but we believe
that the shootings
are indicative OF A SINGLE KILLER

147
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,280
one who's not a gang member.

148
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,780
you're saying
one shooter,
multiple weapons.

149
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,000
that's the theory.

150
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,180
both attacks were detailed,
well planned out traps,

151
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,639
not typical for a gang hit.

152
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,537
and the trophy taking suggests
serial pathology, as well.

153
00:07:18,657 --> 00:07:20,480
all right, look,
i know i called
you guys in,

154
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,880
but i am way out on a limb here.

155
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,680
my officers feel like
it's a betrayal,

156
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,980
like i don't trust them
to find this son of a bitch.

157
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,880
i gotta get this
settled fast
before this WHOLE DEPARTMENT COMES UNGLUED.

158
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,280
look, i get it. we're only here to help and not hijack the investigation.

159
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,700
but if our theory is correct,

160
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,400
the unsub's already looking
for another excuse to kill again.

161
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,980
see, this is twelve's
territory.

162
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,080
and you think
they're behind this?

163
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,080
does it matter?

164
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,980
yes, it matters to us,
lieutenant.

165
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,980
you know this city
and its gangs
better than we do.

166
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,900
we'd like to hear
your theories.

167
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,400
ok, twelves has a captain.

168
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,080
street name playboy.

169
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,600
vice broke up
a drug ring.

170
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,680
shot his brother, d.o.a.

171
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,600
playboy thought
he would kill us all.

172
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,080
well, it is pretty
strong motivation,

173
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,880
but your commander
said the dash cam
only showed ONE ATTACKER

174
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
most 'bangers will
bring some back-up
just in case.

175
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,980
well, playboy runs
the toughest crew in town.

176
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,680
he's not "most 'bangers."

177
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,080
well, you said the dash cam
only showed one attacker.

178
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,380
why show your face at all?

179
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,280
because he had to.

180
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,780
he wanted to take them
both out at the house,

181
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,180
but they broke
protocol.

182
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,480
rodriguez approached
the house by himself.

183
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,280
wait a minute.
are you telling me
they screwed up?

184
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,300
no, lieutenant,
i'm saying that
they split up,

185
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,280
forcing the unsub
to take them out
separately,

186
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,980
one here at the house
and one at the car.

187
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,380
that front unit's empty.

188
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,700
he could have set himself up
there and waited.

189
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,100
the element of surprise
was on his side.

190
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,080
choice
of neighborhood
was deliberate.

191
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,200
neighbors around here
are used to hearing gunfire.

192
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,400
they'll blame it
on the gangs,
and so will the police.

193
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,300
techs have gone
over this
frame by frame.

194
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,400
there's no way
to identify
the shooter.

195
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,880
approximate height
and weight, that's about
all we got.

196
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,480
the unsub's face isn't
the only way to identify him.

197
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,180
we also look at specific
behavioral traits.

198
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,280
these are the reasons
you don't believe
it's a gang?

199
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,180
the shooter established
what we call a signature,

200
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,180
something he did during the murders that wasn't actually necessary.

201
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,080
not part of his m.o.,
but identical in every attack.

202
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,180
in this case, the unsub took the officer's badges.

203
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,180
he's symbolically stripping
them of their power
and authority.

204
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,700
this act is indicative
of someone who is looking
to gain self-esteem.

205
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,080
gang members and other assailants who work together
kill for different
reasons,

206
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,080
but usually it's not
to gain confidence,

207
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,600
'cause they already
have it.

208
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,180
hotch, you see that?
can we pause this?

209
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,500
ok, now zoom in
and press play.

210
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,500
taking the badge
would have taken
a few seconds.

211
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,500
- he's lingering.
- doing what?

212
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,000
that's a good question.

213
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,680
at least now, everyone with force knows he's out there.

214
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,980
it'll be harder for him
to lure someone into his trap.

215
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,480
well, not
necessarily.

216
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,680
being a cop is
always dangerous,

217
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,080
but even with the extra back-up and rover cars added to the shifts,

218
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,200
phoenix p.d.'s
still going to have
to do their job.

219
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,780
which means walking into a potential ambush

220
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,880
every time
they take a call.

221
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,180
245 in progress,
106 east broadway road.

222
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,480
repeat, 245,

223
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,400
report of
an aggravated assault.

224
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,900
copy that.

225
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,100
behind the car.

226
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,200
oh, yeah.

227
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,400
looks like
a couple of bums.

228
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,500
hey, police!

229
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,200
clear out of here!

230
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,500
i got it!

231
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,900
son of a bitch!

232
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,800
mark!

233
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,000
mark!

234
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,200
mark!

235
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,200
officer down,
106 east broadway road.

236
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,500
copy that, officer,
calling for back-up.

237
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,780
1099, code 2.
repeat, 1099,

238
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,800
code 2,
106 east broadway road.

239
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,800
mark!

240
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,680
car 5-1,
back-up is on the way.

241
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,600
car 5-1, i repeat,
back-up is on the way.

242
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,700
thank you.

243
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,580
he set us up.

244
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,200
we knew he was out there,
he still managed to set us up.

245
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,700
i'm sorry.

246
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,600
i watched my partner die,

247
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,400
and i couldn't do
anything to save him.

248
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,800
don't worry, ron.

249
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,500
playboy's going
to pay for this.

250
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,000
you saw playboy there?

251
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,280
- no, but--
- we all know
he did it, agent.

252
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,000
no, we don't.

253
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,880
lieutenant, you think
i don't know how bad
you want this guy?

254
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,480
i was a uniform
just like you.

255
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,300
i saw a lot
of cops go down.

256
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,300
before that,
i watched my father get shot.

257
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,680
he was killed
doing his job,
a cop's job,

258
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,800
so don't think
i don't know.

259
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,800
officer mercer, what happened when you got the call?

260
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,300
nothing special.

261
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,800
report of an aggravated assault.

262
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,600
we were on it.

263
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,200
this your regular beat?

264
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,800
we were additional tonight,
added because of the shootings.

265
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,500
did you get a look
at the guy?

266
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,400
nothing.

267
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,700
i was too damn scared.

268
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,100
i'm still scared.

269
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,500
you're not
the only one.

270
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,200
my partner's family.

271
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,180
what am i going
to tell them?

272
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,700
the only thing
you can tell them--

273
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,300
that we're going
to catch the guy
who did this.

274
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,300
but the right guy.

275
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,200
anything?

276
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,600
we can forget cross referencing.

277
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,600
these guys were just
assigned this beat.

278
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,880
there's no way the unsub
could have known
they'd get the call.

279
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,980
he's using the 9-1-1
calls like a lottery.

280
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,280
he's picking cops
at random.

281
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,380
and yet there's
nothing random
about the shootings.

282
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,080
each scenario has been
increasingly complex.

283
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,680
he's enjoying the hunt.

284
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,980
taking the time
to set his victims up

285
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,880
and luring them into his net.

286
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,880
it's become as important
to him as the kill itself.

287
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,980
and this last one
he executed

288
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,100
while the fbi
and every cop in
the city was after him.

289
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,980
and the press...

290
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,480
their attention's
feeding him.

291
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,980
playing right into the unsub's need to feel superior.

292
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,600
the press is not
our only problem.

293
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,700
these guys are still trying to pin the shootings on a gangbanger named playboy.

294
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,400
i have a feeling we're not going to be able to hold them off much longer.

295
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,700
hello, playboy.

296
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,200
what the hell, man?

297
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,000
let's go spend some
quality time together.

298
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,600
time for what?

299
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,400
whatever you got,
i didn't do it.

300
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,100
lighten up, man.

301
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,280
i'm telling you,
i didn't do it.

302
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,800
yeah? well, i got a magic eight ball that says you did, playboy.

303
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,600
commander,
what's going on?

304
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,880
what's going on is
my officers are being
shot in the streets

305
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,280
and crucified
by the press.

306
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,080
that's what's
going on.

307
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,480
so you've arrested
the wrong person?

308
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,900
i brought in a viable
suspect for questioning.

309
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,000
i had to do something.

310
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,600
i didn't kill
no cop.

311
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,000
period.

312
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,000
sure, playboy.

313
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,480
just cross your heart,
and we're done.

314
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,280
commander, i understand
the pressure you're under,

315
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,480
but doing this could
undermine the investigation.

316
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,280
bringing in another
suspect draws attention
away from the real unsub.

317
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,380
if he starts to feel
inadequate,

318
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,480
he may strike sooner
just to prove himself.

319
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,580
it's also possible
accusing one of their
members could antagonize

320
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,280
local gangs,
which is the last thing
your officers need to be

321
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,780
- worrying about right now.
- all right, look.

322
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,480
i told you guys
i was out on
a limb here,

323
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,780
so unless you have
a suspect...

324
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,000
hotch.

325
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:31,880
since we've got
this guy,

326
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,500
why don't we see
if we can use him?

327
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,800
you mind if talk to him?

328
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,600
be my guest.

329
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,980
commander, i appreciate your letting agent morgan join the interrogation,

330
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,880
but i promise you,
this is not our unsub.

331
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,900
the real killer's
still out there.

332
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,800
i know you didn't do it,
playboy.

333
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,300
so why you dragging
my ass in here, then?

334
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,380
<i>i said i know you didn't
kill those cops,</i>

335
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,400
but he doesn't.

336
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,380
and they don't.
and trust me,

337
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,680
they don't care, man.

338
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,000
but you do.

339
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,580
oh, you care about me.

340
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,500
i don't give a damn
about you.

341
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,000
tell you what
i do care about.

342
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:16,980
catching the killer.

343
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,280
i told you,
i didn't do it.

344
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,980
but i think
you know who did.

345
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,300
no way, man.

346
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,380
it wasn't one of us.

347
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,500
ok.

348
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,800
i'll give you that.

349
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,200
whoever did do this
ain't no 'banger.

350
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,800
but he's been working your hood pretty tough, though, huh?

351
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,400
without your say.

352
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,280
he's making you look
real suspect, playboy.

353
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,200
causing you
nothing but trouble.

354
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,300
he won't last long, then.

355
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,900
come on, man,
look around you.

356
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,800
from where i'm sitting, it looks like he's doing all right so far.

357
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,580
i mean, if i'm you,
i'm thinking i want
this guy gone for good.

358
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,900
what you think?

359
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,600
yeah.

360
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,800
you know so much.

361
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,000
who is he?

362
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,380
probably somebody
you'd least suspect.

363
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,580
probably wouldn't even
think twice about him

364
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,000
'cause he really don't
look all that dangerous.

365
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,500
well, at least
not on the surface.

366
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,780
but he gets
real violent.

367
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,580
well, we all violent.

368
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,700
no, no, no,
not like this, man.

369
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,280
this cat goes from cold
to hot in a heartbeat,

370
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,680
nothing in between.

371
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,080
takes everything
real personal.

372
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,780
thinks everybody's
trying to put him down,

373
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,180
so he's always
looking for a fight,

374
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,300
even if he knows
he's going to lose.

375
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,400
so he's stupid.
maybe.

376
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,200
but he's aggressive.

377
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,000
think, man.

378
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,180
you give me
something,

379
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,500
maybe i get you
out of all of this.

380
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,780
he's white.

381
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,800
he's older than you,
not by much.

382
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,200
and he works alone.

383
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,100
you know somebody like
this, i know you do.

384
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,700
there was this guy...

385
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,500
he was white.

386
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,000
he killed me lieutenant
a couple of months ago.

387
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,280
bobby q.

388
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,500
yeah.

389
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:58,880
he was like my brother.

390
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,980
yeah, your brother
was a junkie,

391
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,500
so was bob q.
i see the similarity.

392
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,380
hey, hey, hey, hey!

393
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,300
sit down, sit down!

394
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,780
don't even think about it.

395
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,680
talk to me. hey.

396
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,480
forget him.

397
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,100
i'm helping you,
he's not.

398
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,800
all right.

399
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,400
your lieutenant,
bobby q.

400
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,700
what happened?

401
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,780
well, i told the cops
it wasn't a gang thing.

402
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,780
they didn't believe me.

403
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,980
yeah, that's 'cause
you always tell us
the truth,

404
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:29,980
don't you, playboy?

405
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,480
i'm serious, man.

406
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,800
playboy, don't do it.

407
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,400
so who killed him?

408
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,800
if i knew his name,
he'd be dead already.

409
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,100
there's been
another shooting.

410
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,380
i'll cut him loose.

411
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,300
no. not yet.

412
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,700
hotch, this guy
knows something.

413
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,700
all right,
keep working on it.

414
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,280
they have the shooter
cornered in an apartment
building downtown.

415
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,980
dave, stay with morgan,
see what this guy
has to offer.

416
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,200
prentiss, you're with me.

417
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:34,780
he's in there?

418
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,880
yeah,
we got him cornered.

419
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,080
men on both floors
and the entrances.

420
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:38,680
you know this guy?

421
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,180
yeah, a banger
called diablo.

422
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,180
he's one of the lindo
park assassins.

423
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,680
daws followed him here.

424
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,600
he all right?

425
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,080
he'll live.
he's a lucky bastard.

426
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,680
we'd like to talk
to daws, if you
don't mind.

427
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,400
all right, ok,
stay down.

428
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,200
sergeant daws.

429
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,580
i'm special agent
emily prentiss,
this is ssa hotchner.

430
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,700
what happened?

431
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,380
he killed my partner.

432
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,500
we're sorry.

433
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,700
we were stopped
at a light.

434
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,680
bastard came right up
to the window.

435
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,580
shot scotty in the head,
then shot me.

436
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,400
- wait a minute.
- there was no radio call?

437
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,700
no. came out of nowhere.

438
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,700
guess he thought
he'd bagged us both.

439
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,700
luckily, a truck came.
he ran.

440
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,200
i called it in,
managed to tail him here.

441
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,680
ok, thank you, sergeant.

442
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,480
it doesn't track.

443
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,300
- no, it was a blitz attack.
- let's go.

444
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,480
let us go in and try
to talk him down.

445
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,600
no, hold on.

446
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,780
- what's going on?
- i've got movement.

447
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,200
looks like ramey
and wilhelm are
inside the apartment.

448
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,200
attempting to apprehend.

449
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,600
what the hell
happened in there?

450
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,180
daws said it's a blitz attack.
it's a different m.o.

451
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,000
yeah, and this was done
in broad daylight.

452
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,900
it's not our guy.

453
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,000
yeah, morgan,
what have you got?

454
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,400
well, playboy's lieutenant was shot in the neck with a .357 magnum.

455
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,980
could have been our guy.

456
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,680
all right, i want you
to stay on it.

457
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,700
- hotch, what's going on?
- nothing good.

458
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,180
garcia, i need you
to pull everything you can
on a phoenix gangbanger ???

459
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,500
<i>muy pronto.</i>

460
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,380
well, let's
close it off here.

461
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,800
commander, can i speak
to you for a second?

462
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,180
sorry to see it end this way,
losing another officer,

463
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,280
but i'm glad it's over.

464
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,000
sir, i don't believe
that it is.

465
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,280
what are you saying?
the guy is dead.

466
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,600
this suspect diablo
doesn't fit the profile.

467
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,680
are you telling me
he didn't shoot
officer daws AND HIS PARTNER?

468
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,680
what i'm saying is, he may not be responsible for the earlier killings.

469
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,580
agent hotchner!

470
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,380
commander,
we have to be sure!

471
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,100
agent hotchner!

472
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,880
i have got the chief,
i've got the press,i've the mayor.

473
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,980
do you realize the pressure the department's under right now?

474
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,900
yes, sir, i do,
but it wasn't him.

475
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,425
there was an earlier murder with the same m.o.

476
00:23:15,545 --> 00:23:16,980
this unsub may have
killed one of the twelves.

477
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,180
and how does that
help us?

478
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,780
this unsub thinks
of himself as
a big game hunter now,

479
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,280
but he didn't
start out that way.

480
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,080
- meaning?
- he started
with a gang member,

481
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,300
and he's evolved.

482
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,980
give me 24 hours.

483
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,800
they're not gonna
wait that long,
and neither is the chief.

484
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,600
i'll give you four.

485
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,900
thanks, man.
great job.

486
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,680
evans.

487
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,080
i need your help.

488
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,580
i'd like you to pull
a file on playboy's lieutenant.

489
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,280
it's over, agent.
we got the guy.

490
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,442
no, we didn't.

491
00:23:52,918 --> 00:23:55,680
what, because he turned
out to be a gangbanger
after all?

492
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,280
let it go.

493
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,780
you guys made a mistake.
you guys were wrong.

494
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,080
so was i.

495
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,680
no harm, no foul.

496
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,680
no offense, lieutenant,
but we're not wrong.

497
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,680
the killer is still out there,
and more cops will die.

498
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,680
you heard
what officer mercer said.

499
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,280
his partner was shot.

500
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,180
he couldn't do anything
to save him.

501
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,880
do you want
to feel like that

502
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,080
when another one
of your guys
does get killed?

503
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,500
or do you want
to know that you did
everything you could
to try to keep it
from happening again?

504
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,180
ballistics aren't back yet,

505
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,280
but the preliminary
m.e. reports

506
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,680
suggest the weapon
used to kill officer beck

507
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,380
was not a .357.

508
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,480
i spoke to garcia.
beck arrested diablo
twice on drug charges,

509
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,880
last time sent him away
for 10 years.

510
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,080
diablo was just released
on parole last week.

511
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,380
so diablo went after
the cop who put him away

512
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,680
assuming it would be
lumped in with
the other murders.

513
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,080
the unsub would
take the fall.

514
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,580
hey, it almost
worked.

515
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,080
lieutenant,
what did you find?

516
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,300
well, i pulled up
that information
on playboy's lieutenant,
bobby q.

517
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,380
there's not much there.

518
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,980
and you're thinking
playboy was right,

519
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,880
that we didn't
pay enough attention
to the case.

520
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,080
did you?

521
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,480
look, the majority of homicides in this city

522
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,280
most times we spend
time and resources
following trails

523
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,780
that all lead to
the same place anyway.

524
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,180
we just assumed this was just
another one of those trails.

525
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:10,480
being in a gang shortens
your life expectancy,

526
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,980
so it's no big surprise
when a gangbanger
winds up dead.

527
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,480
same thing could be said
about being a cop.

528
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,528
the job involves
a fair amount of risk,

529
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:19,580
so a percentage of untimely deaths is practically inevitable.

530
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,780
the m.o. is the same
as our unsub's.

531
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:26,480
did, um, playboy tell you
if the killer
took a trophy?

532
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,680
he said bobby q's
necklace was missing.

533
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,980
yeah, that's in the report.

534
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,980
big chain, solid gold.

535
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,780
just figured the doer
took it to pawn it.

536
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,580
or as a souvenir.

537
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,680
fits
the signature.

538
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,980
he built up to this.

539
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,500
we need to go further back.

540
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:45,930
garcia, can you pull everything in the phoenix area
that matches the same m.o. as our unsub,

541
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:46,880
not just police officers.

542
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,280
ok. so i'm searching
homicides in phoenix

543
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,780
in, what,
the last 2 months?

544
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,180
make it three.

545
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,480
got it.

546
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,480
murders, shootings,

547
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,180
specifically neck wounds.

548
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,980
oh, i got a guy
named robert quinones,
nickname bobby q.

549
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,780
we already
have that one.
anything else?

550
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,880
ah, just one more.
a bouncer at a bar

551
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,680
in downtown phoenix,

552
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,200
mickey reese.
weapon's a .357 magnum.

553
00:26:11,211 --> 00:26:12,253
interesting.

554
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,680
it says here the victim
was wearing a ballistic vest.

555
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,680
apparently they don't serve
shirley temples at this
establishment.

556
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,980
if the bouncer
was wearing a vest,

557
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,780
that could be how our
unsub developed his m.o.

558
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,480
send us everything
you've got.

559
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,680
sure.

560
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,080
done.

561
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,980
all right,
we got gangbangers,
bouncers and cops.

562
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,080
all pretty tough
targets;

563
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,780
victims capable of
defending themselves.

564
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,980
as the unsub's sense
of power escalated,

565
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,180
so did his confidence,

566
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,080
leading to bigger
and more difficult prey.

567
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,480
that makes sense. risky deaths would increase the unsub's feeling of superiority.

568
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,080
same thing with using
a .357 magnum.

569
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,880
it would make him
feel powerful.

570
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,280
cops are at the top
of that list.

571
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,780
high profile,
always on alert,

572
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,180
and they're gonna
make headlines.

573
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,380
killing a gangbanger
isn't easy.

574
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,080
they're always armed,
travel in packs.

575
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,880
the bouncer's
the earliest.

576
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,080
it was a pretty
simple attack,

577
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,880
no carefully
thought out plan.

578
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,380
he could have been
his first victim.

579
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,480
we need to figure out
where their paths crossed.

580
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,180
morgan, you, rossi
and the lieutenant

581
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,480
go check out the bar.

582
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,900
we'll keep digging.

583
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,580
like i told
the cop before,

584
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,680
it could have
been anyone.

585
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,300
did reese have
any enemies?

586
00:27:13,053 --> 00:27:14,475
that's all he had.

587
00:27:14,595 --> 00:27:17,071
mick was
a real hard ass.
always looking
to get into it.

588
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,580
pissed off someone
pretty much every night.

589
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,780
looks like he took
quite a beating
before he was killed.

590
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:26,500
any idea which one
of your patrons
might have given him
these bruises?

591
00:27:27,089 --> 00:27:28,677
didn't get those
here, man.

592
00:27:28,797 --> 00:27:31,680
dude was into some
kind of crazy club.

593
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,180
extreme fighting,
or some crap like that.

594
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,480
looked like that,
and worse, all the time.

595
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,080
worked pretty good for his job, know what i mean?

596
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,080
a fight club would be the perfect place for the unsub to try to prove himself.

597
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,080
and a beating
might be the stressor
we're looking for.

598
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,280
do you know
where this club is?

599
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,900
go, go!

600
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,280
fbi, get on the ground!

601
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,280
get on the ground right now!

602
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,380
get on the ground!
get on the ground!

603
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,900
don't move! get down!

604
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:23,414
that way, let's go.

605
00:28:23,534 --> 00:28:25,265
ain't breaking
no laws here, officer.

606
00:28:25,385 --> 00:28:27,752
agents, no matter
what it looks like...

607
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:30,235
i think he's trying
to let us know they have
to right to be idiots.

608
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,580
they do, but not here.
listen up, folks.

609
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,080
this warehouse
is not private property.

610
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,900
it is owned by the city,
which means...

611
00:28:39,334 --> 00:28:41,380
y'all are going to jail.

612
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,180
pack 'em up, let's go.

613
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,980
we ain't hurting nobody,
except maybe each other.

614
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,680
yeah, i feel you,
but we're still
taking you in.

615
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,480
unless you want
to answer some questions

616
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,900
and make all this go away.

617
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,980
so ask me.

618
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,580
you know this man?

619
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:02,380
yeah. boom. i heard. but i didn't kill him.

620
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,480
no, but someone
who came here did.

621
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,980
no way.

622
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,080
boom could take
all of us.

623
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,080
we aren't
looking for a tough guy.

624
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,700
the man we're looking for
probably lost every fight.

625
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,400
he came in here trying
to be a man.

626
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,780
but he failed.

627
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:24,180
guy went down easily.

628
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,680
candy ass.

629
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,700
maybe even
in his first fight.

630
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,380
he probably reacted
poorly to that.

631
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,300
to the point where
you and your boys,
you ridiculed him.

632
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,200
all this led him
to pick up a gun.

633
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,780
there was a guy.

634
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,300
called himself "animal."

635
00:29:45,923 --> 00:29:47,791
lost every fight,

636
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:50,980
but he kept coming back,
getting in boom's face,

637
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,900
calling him out.

638
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:56,880
most guys lose big,
they run home,

639
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,080
tail between their legs.

640
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,300
this one freaked.

641
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,580
there's something
about that hand
at your throat,

642
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,180
when you're beat.

643
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:26,400
knowing your opponent's got your whole life in his hand.

644
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,200
ah, it's primal, man.

645
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,880
when he lingers...

646
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,180
that's what he's doing
to his victims.

647
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,480
proving his power over life and death.

648
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,680
what's
animal's real name?

649
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,980
there's no names here.

650
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,480
just nicknames.

651
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,680
like me.
i'm beanie.

652
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,080
well, what do you know
about this animal?
anything at all?

653
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,780
nothing. that's the way
it works, you know?

654
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,780
don't talk about it.

655
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,080
how about a description?

656
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:02,421
scrawny, white trash.
thought he's a whole lot
tougher than he is.

657
00:31:02,541 --> 00:31:07,180
get him set up with
a sketch artist.
beanie...let's go.

658
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,780
so what do we do now?

659
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,180
we don't have
a lot of choices.

660
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,280
based on his escalating
timeline,

661
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,680
this guy's about
to strike again soon.

662
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,100
there's really
only one thing
we can do.

663
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,680
earlier today,

664
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,680
the phoenix police
announced the suspect

665
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,800
responsible for the deaths
of 5 phoenix officers
had been caught.

666
00:31:27,295 --> 00:31:28,980
that is not the case.

667
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,400
the killer
is still at large.

668
00:31:33,185 --> 00:31:36,849
there have been quite
a few mistakes made
over the course

669
00:31:36,969 --> 00:31:38,880
mistakes that could have
been avoided.

670
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,180
as a result of this, the fbi is officially taking charge of the investigation.

671
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,980
we have established a tip line,

672
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,180
and a sketch of
the subject is being
released to the press.

673
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:54,900
we encourage anyone with any information about the shooter

674
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,980
the man
we're looking for
is a narcissist

675
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,780
desperate to prove
his masculinity.

676
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,180
he does this by going after
high risk targets

677
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,171
like gang members
and police officers.

678
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:09,333
because he's a narcissist, this unsub will be
following the investigation closely.

679
00:32:09,453 --> 00:32:11,498
by pretending to take over the investigation,

680
00:32:11,618 --> 00:32:13,599
we've put ourselves above the local police,

681
00:32:13,719 --> 00:32:15,465
thus suggesting that we're tougher to take out,

682
00:32:15,585 --> 00:32:18,866
and issuing the unsub a challenge
that he won't be able to ignore.

683
00:32:18,986 --> 00:32:22,166
and painting a target directly on agent Hotchner's back.

684
00:32:22,286 --> 00:32:24,166
all the attacks, with the exception of the last one,

685
00:32:24,286 --> 00:32:25,932
have taken place in the twelve's territory.

686
00:32:26,052 --> 00:32:27,866
this is the unsub's hunting ground,

687
00:32:27,986 --> 00:32:29,832
and he's unlikely to stray from it.

688
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:32,066
where did you say you saw the suspect?

689
00:32:32,186 --> 00:32:33,565
police department, how can i help you?

690
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:35,485
phoenix police hotline.

691
00:32:37,019 --> 00:32:39,266
locations have multiple vanish points for the shooter,

692
00:32:39,386 --> 00:32:41,732
but limited access and exit routes for his victims.

693
00:32:41,852 --> 00:32:43,398
we'll be looking for a similar situation.

694
00:32:43,518 --> 00:32:45,166
this should happen very quickly.

695
00:32:45,286 --> 00:32:46,966
don't forget--

696
00:32:47,086 --> 00:32:49,299
this guy managed to take out 5 cops by himself.

697
00:32:49,419 --> 00:32:50,832
he smart, and he's fearless.

698
00:32:50,952 --> 00:32:53,148
he won't be easy to take down.

699
00:32:53,977 --> 00:32:55,990
fbi tip line.

700
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:58,257
i saw that guy. your killer.

701
00:32:58,377 --> 00:32:59,890
the one from tv.

702
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:01,124
male caller.

703
00:33:01,244 --> 00:33:02,456
he says he knows where the unsub lives,

704
00:33:02,576 --> 00:33:04,024
and it fits the criteria.

705
00:33:04,144 --> 00:33:06,157
2717 gelson avenue.

706
00:33:06,277 --> 00:33:08,224
it's the twelve's territory, just off the main street.

707
00:33:08,344 --> 00:33:11,790
looks like there's a series of smaller feeders and allies nearby.

708
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:12,957
this could be it. let's go.

709
00:33:13,077 --> 00:33:14,534
slow down, lieutenant. he'll be expecting us.

710
00:33:14,654 --> 00:33:16,524
all of us. this is his last stand.

711
00:33:16,644 --> 00:33:17,538
he's going to want to make it count.

712
00:33:17,658 --> 00:33:19,471
yeah, well, this time we know about it and we're ready.

713
00:33:19,591 --> 00:33:21,708
his trap could still work.

714
00:33:21,828 --> 00:33:23,104
15th avenue and gelson. what do you know about the neighborhood?

715
00:33:23,224 --> 00:33:27,146
it's rough. lots of dead-end streets, allies.

716
00:33:27,266 --> 00:33:28,523
major cross street, 17th.

717
00:33:28,643 --> 00:33:30,694
residential? any businesses at all?

718
00:33:30,814 --> 00:33:33,871
there's a gas station a couple of blocks down, but that's about it.

719
00:33:33,991 --> 00:33:35,284
hey, Garcia? yes?

720
00:33:35,404 --> 00:33:38,271
can you get us a satellite image
of 15th avenue and gelson?

721
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:42,641
but of course. ok, real time satellite image shows...

722
00:33:42,761 --> 00:33:46,475
not a whole heck of a lot. i've got a 2-story apartment building,

723
00:33:46,595 --> 00:33:48,264
no activity of any kind,

724
00:33:48,384 --> 00:33:50,017
no cars out in front.

725
00:33:50,137 --> 00:33:51,783
oh, there's a car down the street.

726
00:33:51,903 --> 00:33:54,184
no heat registering, engine must be cool.

727
00:33:54,304 --> 00:33:59,587
satellite monitoring the last 12 hours
is like library-quiet.

728
00:33:59,707 --> 00:34:02,369
a truck and 2 cars left in the a.m.,
nothing came in.

729
00:34:02,518 --> 00:34:03,317
thank you, Garcia. all right,

730
00:34:03,437 --> 00:34:05,483
there's a major street in front on the east side,

731
00:34:05,603 --> 00:34:09,230
an ally, and 2 smaller streets
to the north and south right here.

732
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:12,433
lieutenant, commander, i need a sniper here and here.

733
00:34:12,553 --> 00:34:15,559
once they're set, the bulk of the squad cars can approach from the south,

734
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,622
and the rest of us from the east very quietly.

735
00:34:17,742 --> 00:34:19,764
from this point forward, everybody goes in on foot.

736
00:34:19,884 --> 00:34:21,316
Morgan, you and i go in first.

737
00:34:21,436 --> 00:34:22,717
Rossi and Prentiss behind us.

738
00:34:22,837 --> 00:34:24,817
Jordan, you and Reid stay here and work the tip line.

739
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:26,050
stay safe, my loves.

740
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:27,570
thanks, Garcia.

741
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,634
clear!

742
00:35:17,754 --> 00:35:19,372
clear!

743
00:35:25,284 --> 00:35:26,383
false alarm.

744
00:35:26,503 --> 00:35:27,950
we knew we'd get some.

745
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:29,550
what now? we wait.

746
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,483
you might want to split your officers into shifts.

747
00:35:31,603 --> 00:35:33,070
it could be a long night.

748
00:36:35,517 --> 00:36:36,976
not this time.

749
00:36:37,096 --> 00:36:38,434
you're done.

750
00:36:42,232 --> 00:36:43,724
let's go.

751
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,911
you knew he wouldn't be at the first address.

752
00:36:54,031 --> 00:36:55,868
we figured he'd wait until Hotch was alone.

753
00:36:55,988 --> 00:36:58,298
so the tip was a diversion.

754
00:36:58,418 --> 00:37:00,629
something like that.

755
00:37:00,884 --> 00:37:02,261
thank you.

756
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:04,532
and your team.

757
00:37:05,499 --> 00:37:07,138
no thanks necessary, lieutenant.

758
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:09,419
we did it together.

759
00:37:16,399 --> 00:37:17,732
no, playboy!

760
00:37:45,998 --> 00:37:47,579
Hotch...

761
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:49,712
why don't you go on ahead?

762
00:37:49,832 --> 00:37:51,512
i think i'm going to stick around.

763
00:37:51,632 --> 00:37:53,198
there's something i want to do.

764
00:38:24,766 --> 00:38:26,145
agent Morgan.

765
00:38:26,265 --> 00:38:28,078
derek.

766
00:38:28,198 --> 00:38:29,599
this way.

767
00:38:31,565 --> 00:38:34,579
this is agent Morgan from the fbi.

768
00:38:34,699 --> 00:38:38,479
maggie cunningham and sam, my partner's family.

769
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:40,545
mrs. cunningham,

770
00:38:40,665 --> 00:38:41,746
i'm sorry for your loss.

771
00:38:41,866 --> 00:38:43,332
thank you.

772
00:38:44,332 --> 00:38:45,676
hey, sam...

773
00:38:45,862 --> 00:38:48,192
we got the bad guy who did this.

774
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,373
sam, your father was a hero.

775
00:38:51,939 --> 00:38:54,939
don't you ever forget that.

776
00:39:32,415 --> 00:39:37,023
"for he today who sheds his blood with me shall be my brother."

777
00:39:37,143 --> 00:39:39,204
william shakespeare.

778
