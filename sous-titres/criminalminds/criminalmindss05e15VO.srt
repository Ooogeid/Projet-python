1
00:00:05,421 --> 00:00:06,727
Come on. Come on.

2
00:00:06,897 --> 00:00:07,813
Sophia.

3
00:00:08,211 --> 00:00:08,978
Honey.

4
00:00:11,671 --> 00:00:13,030
What is mommy feeding you?

5
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:15,046
Nice. Give our
daughter a weight complex.

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,073
- Do you have a weight complex?
- Yes.

7
00:00:18,213 --> 00:00:19,308
Let's go inside.

8
00:00:19,614 --> 00:00:21,450
"Though I walk
in the midst of trouble,

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,539
"you preserve my life.

10
00:00:23,938 --> 00:00:27,035
"You stretch out your hand
against the anger of my foes,

11
00:00:27,307 --> 00:00:29,907
"and with your right hand, you save me.

12
00:00:30,268 --> 00:00:31,842
The word of the lord."

13
00:00:32,012 --> 00:00:33,511
Thanks be to god.

14
00:00:35,874 --> 00:00:37,055
The body of Christ.

15
00:00:40,189 --> 00:00:41,974
- The body of Christ.
- *****

16
00:00:45,383 --> 00:00:46,495
The body of Christ.

17
00:00:46,665 --> 00:00:48,193
- The blood of Christ.
- *****

18
00:00:58,263 --> 00:01:00,883
Daddy, can I have some of that?

19
00:01:01,053 --> 00:01:04,307
Not till you're 21
or your first communion.

20
00:01:18,396 --> 00:01:19,530
Mommy, my doll...

21
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,692
I'm taking this away from you.

22
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:26,539
OK, now is not the time to play.
After communion, we talk to Jesus.

23
00:01:26,709 --> 00:01:28,160
I don't want to talk to Jesus!

24
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:32,376
Well, try. Listen, I know it's hard,
but if you really try...

25
00:01:33,144 --> 00:01:34,148
you'be...

26
00:01:35,002 --> 00:01:36,353
honey? Honey?

27
00:01:38,138 --> 00:01:39,857
Paul! Help! Oh, god!

28
00:01:40,305 --> 00:01:42,105
Please! Somebody help me!

29
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:43,938
Somebody, please! Please help me!

30
00:01:44,108 --> 00:01:45,684
Please! Please help me!

31
00:01:45,944 --> 00:01:47,240
Daddy, are you all right?!

32
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:48,641
Is anyone a doctor?!

33
00:01:49,135 --> 00:01:50,063
Call 911!

34
00:01:52,784 --> 00:01:54,918
Take your daughter away! Now!

35
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,080
Baby! Baby, come here! Come here.

36
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:06,056
Call 911!

37
00:02:07,151 --> 00:02:09,702
This is captain Paul Collins.
He's the third victim in 2 weeks

38
00:02:09,872 --> 00:02:11,188
in providence, Rhode Island.

39
00:02:11,358 --> 00:02:12,127
Captain?

40
00:02:12,297 --> 00:02:14,354
he just returned home 2 weeks ago

41
00:02:14,524 --> 00:02:17,007
He's a decorated war hero.
from his fourth tour in Iraq.

42
00:02:17,073 --> 00:02:18,941
Was he targeted because
he's in the military?

43
00:02:18,955 --> 00:02:21,980
No. Just like the first two victims,
he was targeted because he was convenient.

44
00:02:22,035 --> 00:02:24,392
He was killed at a church
during an early service.

45
00:02:24,401 --> 00:02:26,363
Neck was cut open,
severed the carotid artery.

46
00:02:26,401 --> 00:02:27,832
Bled out in a matter of moments.

47
00:02:27,877 --> 00:02:28,874
Right in front of his daughter.

48
00:02:28,921 --> 00:02:31,833
Murder in a church is highly symbolic.
Is there a religious agenda involved?

49
00:02:31,898 --> 00:02:33,606
The detective on the case, Jake Moreland,

50
00:02:33,634 --> 00:02:35,543
ruled that out because
of the first two victims.

51
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,473
The first victim,
Mike O'donnell, was found

52
00:02:37,511 --> 00:02:39,318
under a sink in the men's
room at a restaurant.

53
00:02:39,355 --> 00:02:40,341
What kind of restaurant?

54
00:02:40,388 --> 00:02:42,676
Local place,
white tablecloths and jug wine.

55
00:02:42,724 --> 00:02:45,577
The second victim, Karen Lagrassa,
was killed at the laundromat.

56
00:02:45,747 --> 00:02:46,889
All 3 had their throats slashe

57
00:02:47,059 --> 00:02:49,244
aside from MO,
the victimology's all over the place.

58
00:02:49,748 --> 00:02:51,782
It's like this guy doesn't
care who he's killing,

59
00:02:52,432 --> 00:02:55,644
And he's doing it in public without
compunction for who sees him.

60
00:02:55,814 --> 00:02:57,150
Do we have a sketch?

61
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,720
All anyone can agree on is that it's
a white male between 25 and 40.

62
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,055
Well, that narrows it
down to all of providence.

63
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:07,293
Hard to fault the witnesses given
how bloody these murders must be.

64
00:03:07,463 --> 00:03:10,101
What bothers me is the cooling off
period is getting shorter and shorter,

65
00:03:10,271 --> 00:03:12,630
with no attempt to hide who
he is or what he's doing.

66
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,689
I mean, an unsub this bold could be
suffering from a major psychotic break.

67
00:03:15,859 --> 00:03:18,098
I already asked detective
Moreland to pull recent releases

68
00:03:18,268 --> 00:03:19,601
on prisons and mental hospitals.

69
00:03:19,602 --> 00:03:22,339
We need to get to providence asap.
Whether he's suffering a

70
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:24,905
psychotic break or not,
this could be the start of a spree.

71
00:03:24,906 --> 00:03:26,864
And anyone is a potential target.

72
00:03:30,992 --> 00:03:58,987
Criminal Team
http://experts.heberg-forum.net/

73
00:04:02,369 --> 00:04:03,488
"show me a hero

74
00:04:03,912 --> 00:04:05,923
and I will write you a tragedy."

75
00:04:06,093 --> 00:04:07,644
F. Scott Fitzgerald.

76
00:04:09,455 --> 00:04:10,787
Why is he using a knife?

77
00:04:11,047 --> 00:04:13,317
Guns assure the highest
number of fatalities.

78
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:17,200
If all he's interested in is quantity
he could be doing this more efficiently

79
00:04:17,864 --> 00:04:20,336
He could be training.
Spree killers often to dry runs

80
00:04:20,506 --> 00:04:21,906
before they start their rampage.

81
00:04:22,076 --> 00:04:24,371
Most spree killers have lost
control by the time they begin.

82
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:25,646
They're always male.

83
00:04:25,816 --> 00:04:27,412
And if they don't fall into
the school shooter category,

84
00:04:27,417 --> 00:04:29,747
they're older, 40s and 50s,
socially isolated.

85
00:04:29,917 --> 00:04:32,998
The stressor's usually the dissolution
of their last social outlet.

86
00:04:33,168 --> 00:04:35,417
George Hennard was
inspired by James Huberty.

87
00:04:35,418 --> 00:04:38,637
Between the two of them, they shot
43 people at fast food restaurants.

88
00:04:38,807 --> 00:04:40,587
Well, if he's practicing
for his mass murder,

89
00:04:40,757 --> 00:04:42,533
he's definitely getting bolder about it.

90
00:04:42,703 --> 00:04:43,589
And bloodier.

91
00:04:43,999 --> 00:04:45,970
Right now, the shock and
awe of the bloodletting

92
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,094
seems to be what he's going for.
But soon, that won't be enough.

93
00:04:49,264 --> 00:04:51,328
That makes sense with
regards to his fantasy life.

94
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:54,061
If he is planning something big,
he'll spend his day dreaming of it,

95
00:04:54,231 --> 00:04:56,512
getting back at slights
both real and imagined.

96
00:04:56,682 --> 00:04:57,960
Without a specific target victim,

97
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,669
we need to concentrate
on the crime scenes

98
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:02,137
and see what they tell us.
Prentiss, you take the laundromat.

99
00:05:02,138 --> 00:05:03,631
I'll have detective
Moreland meet you there.

100
00:05:03,891 --> 00:05:06,349
I'd like to take a look
at the church if you don't mind.

101
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:08,776
JJ, you and Morgan
interview captain Collins' wife.

102
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,208
She got the best look at the unsub.
See what she remembers.

103
00:05:11,752 --> 00:05:13,800
Reid and I will run point
from the police station.

104
00:05:31,012 --> 00:05:32,083
Agent Rossi?

105
00:05:32,556 --> 00:05:33,803
You must be father Kendellen.

106
00:05:33,973 --> 00:05:35,169
Thank you for coming so quickly.

107
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:37,170
It's the ls*t we can do, father.

108
00:05:37,784 --> 00:05:39,030
To be honest,

109
00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:42,116
I've been struggling to
understand all this. It's been

110
00:05:42,983 --> 00:05:43,817
Trying.

111
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:47,175
I don't like to see crime tape
in front of church doors.

112
00:05:47,345 --> 00:05:49,168
I can't imagine how you feel.

113
00:05:50,493 --> 00:05:52,160
Ash Wednesday's next week.

114
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,950
These doors should never
be closed to the community.

115
00:06:01,655 --> 00:06:03,926
To be honest, agent Hotchner,
when they told me BAU was coming,

116
00:06:04,096 --> 00:06:05,375
I expected more than two agents.

117
00:06:05,545 --> 00:06:07,801
The rest of the agents went
straight to the crime scenes.

118
00:06:07,971 --> 00:06:09,139
I believe there'll be information there

119
00:06:09,309 --> 00:06:11,422
that may determine where
the unsub will strike next.

120
00:06:11,592 --> 00:06:14,399
As soon as you can, I'd like you to
meet agent Prentiss at the laundromat

121
00:06:14,569 --> 00:06:15,450
Yeah, sure.

122
00:06:17,371 --> 00:06:18,993
Any idea on where he may hit next?

123
00:06:19,315 --> 00:06:20,508
We can double patrols.

124
00:06:20,678 --> 00:06:22,189
It's honestly too early to tell.

125
00:06:22,617 --> 00:06:24,506
Well, your gut must be
telling you something.

126
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,881
Well, this far, he's struck
at a restaurant bathroom,

127
00:06:27,051 --> 00:06:28,343
a laundromat, and a church.

128
00:06:29,116 --> 00:06:31,126
He chooses his victims
not out of preference,

129
00:06:31,296 --> 00:06:34,464
But of favorable circumstance.
with each kill he's growing bolder,

130
00:06:34,634 --> 00:06:37,217
telling us he doesn't care who sees him.

131
00:06:37,632 --> 00:06:39,358
So next time
it'll be even more public.

132
00:06:39,422 --> 00:06:42,651
Yes. Our technical analyst
is compiling a list of public events

133
00:06:42,821 --> 00:06:45,400
that your department should be
monitoring. Garcia, are you there?

134
00:06:46,974 --> 00:06:49,027
Wired for sound
and ready for action.

135
00:06:49,324 --> 00:06:50,344
What have you got so far?

136
00:06:50,514 --> 00:06:51,957
Well, you got your "sesame street on ice,"

137
00:06:52,127 --> 00:06:54,584
your Harlem globetrotters,
your Beatles cover bands,

138
00:06:54,754 --> 00:06:56,773
not to mention the dozens of college bars

139
00:06:56,943 --> 00:06:59,526
and late-night hangouts frequented
by the youth of America.

140
00:06:59,696 --> 00:07:01,535
No event is too big or too small.

141
00:07:01,705 --> 00:07:02,692
Good. Keep going.

142
00:07:02,862 --> 00:07:04,103
Aye, aye, Cap'n.

143
00:08:06,316 --> 00:08:07,988
No respect, even now.

144
00:08:09,135 --> 00:08:10,157
I do the talking.

145
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,583
No comment, no comment, no comment.

146
00:08:16,378 --> 00:08:19,673
What's the FBI's invol*ment
in the investigation

147
00:08:19,843 --> 00:08:21,074
no comment. In the murder
of captain Collins?

148
00:08:21,244 --> 00:08:22,476
We are strictly here

149
00:08:22,646 --> 00:08:24,957
just to advise the
providence police department.

150
00:08:25,127 --> 00:08:27,106
Is the Collins murder tied to the
other two stabbings of last week?

151
00:08:27,276 --> 00:08:29,339
And when they are ready
to make their statement,

152
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,090
they'll let you know.
Thank you.

153
00:08:32,472 --> 00:08:35,344
They've been out there all day.
Some of my friends wanted to come by,

154
00:08:35,514 --> 00:08:36,631
they didn't want to be on the 6:00 news.

155
00:08:36,801 --> 00:08:40,637
Your husband's a hero. Unfortunately,
the circumstances of his death

156
00:08:40,807 --> 00:08:42,558
has caused this to be a media circus.

157
00:08:42,728 --> 00:08:44,560
Well, you'd think they'd show a little...

158
00:08:46,947 --> 00:08:48,956
What did I tell you, Sophia?

159
00:08:49,531 --> 00:08:51,158
Get away from the window.

160
00:08:51,328 --> 00:08:53,026
Are we going to be on TV?

161
00:08:53,196 --> 00:08:54,646
Not if I can help it.

162
00:08:54,995 --> 00:08:57,330
Go in your room and play.
I'll be there in a sec.

163
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,635
I spent years waiting
for a phone call

164
00:09:05,805 --> 00:09:08,253
or one of those letters
they used to hand-deliver

165
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:10,092
to dead soldiers' wives.

166
00:09:11,616 --> 00:09:14,009
They want to know
if I want to bury Paul

167
00:09:14,367 --> 00:09:16,407
at... at Arlington,
but I don't have...

168
00:09:28,085 --> 00:09:29,911
I know you have a job to do.

169
00:09:31,322 --> 00:09:33,162
Let's do this so it's done right.

170
00:09:35,862 --> 00:09:37,622
That's what Paul would say.

171
00:09:39,365 --> 00:09:40,741
What do you need to know?

172
00:09:41,137 --> 00:09:42,787
It happened right here.

173
00:09:43,656 --> 00:09:46,138
You told the police you weren't sure

174
00:09:46,308 --> 00:09:47,813
when the unsub walked in?

175
00:09:51,908 --> 00:09:52,903
I don't know.

176
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,418
One ment he wasn't there,
and then he was.

177
00:09:56,588 --> 00:09:58,477
All right,
let's walk through the mass.

178
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,949
You told the police
that you were late.

179
00:10:01,705 --> 00:10:04,084
They came in during
the first reading.

180
00:10:04,985 --> 00:10:07,519
You know most of
your parishioners on sight?

181
00:10:08,521 --> 00:10:10,555
But not the unsub, right?

182
00:10:12,776 --> 00:10:15,244
I don't know how
I could have missed him.

183
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:18,299
You know the Collins
family personally, right?

184
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,685
Of course.

185
00:10:19,855 --> 00:10:21,716
I mean, Paul,
he grew up at this school.

186
00:10:22,236 --> 00:10:25,622
Whenever he came home,
he made sure to come to mass.

187
00:10:26,677 --> 00:10:30,370
And they sat there in the back
so as not to disturb the mass?

188
00:10:30,914 --> 00:10:32,646
Once they were settled,

189
00:10:33,409 --> 00:10:34,740
could you see them?

190
00:10:38,218 --> 00:10:40,376
Then let yourself off the hook, father.

191
00:10:41,305 --> 00:10:43,509
If you couldn't see the Collins family,

192
00:10:44,052 --> 00:10:45,765
you couldn't see the killer.

193
00:10:49,572 --> 00:10:51,590
But he was definitely
there by communion?

194
00:10:52,114 --> 00:10:53,178
Not before?

195
00:10:54,281 --> 00:10:55,107
I don't remember.

196
00:10:55,277 --> 00:10:58,816
All right. Meg, we can take a break
if you need to take a break.

197
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,918
What is it, sweetie?

198
00:11:07,705 --> 00:11:09,068
I shook his hand.

199
00:11:09,446 --> 00:11:10,769
When was that?

200
00:11:11,194 --> 00:11:13,761
When we all say,
"Peace be with you"

201
00:11:14,344 --> 00:11:15,950
and we shake hands.

202
00:11:16,931 --> 00:11:18,486
I shook his hand.

203
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:20,659
That's right.

204
00:11:21,817 --> 00:11:22,911
She's right.

205
00:11:23,652 --> 00:11:25,446
During the sign of the peace.

206
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:28,502
He touched my baby. He...

207
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:35,361
Oh, god. He t...
he touched my baby.

208
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,036
Meg, I know this is difficult.

209
00:11:37,587 --> 00:11:39,731
But I want you to try and focus.

210
00:11:40,044 --> 00:11:41,555
OK? Stay with me.

211
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,902
I need you to tell me what
happened during communion.

212
00:11:48,572 --> 00:11:49,933
We all got up.

213
00:11:50,248 --> 00:11:51,980
Who got out first, Paul?

214
00:11:54,783 --> 00:11:56,578
But he let me and Sophia

215
00:11:57,382 --> 00:11:58,452
go first.

216
00:12:00,468 --> 00:12:01,917
Paul always goes last.

217
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,561
We... we took communion

218
00:12:07,731 --> 00:12:10,443
and we...
we went back and we, uh...

219
00:12:15,866 --> 00:12:16,831
that's OK.

220
00:12:17,633 --> 00:12:19,134
We're almost done.

221
00:12:19,304 --> 00:12:20,515
You're doing great.

222
00:12:22,204 --> 00:12:23,946
Paul was on your right.

223
00:12:24,515 --> 00:12:26,405
Sophia was on your left.

224
00:12:26,908 --> 00:12:28,216
What happened?

225
00:12:29,544 --> 00:12:30,877
She was playing.

226
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,957
And after communion, you pray.

227
00:12:37,099 --> 00:12:39,020
I leaned down and I told her that.

228
00:12:40,154 --> 00:12:42,658
So you were facing to your left,
away from Paul,

229
00:12:43,723 --> 00:12:45,301
away from the killer.

230
00:12:46,894 --> 00:12:49,513
You never see him coming,
you never see him go.

231
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:54,894
I need a break.

232
00:12:55,461 --> 00:12:56,485
Of course.

233
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,556
I want to stay here.

234
00:13:04,485 --> 00:13:06,170
Meg might recall...

235
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:10,626
more, and even if she doesn't,
what she's going through...

236
00:13:13,021 --> 00:13:14,107
what's wrong?

237
00:13:14,096 --> 00:13:17,129
This unsub isn't psychotic
and he's not gonna go on a spree.

238
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:18,547
He's too patient.

239
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,347
OK, but...

240
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:24,218
what is he trying to accomplish?

241
00:13:26,377 --> 00:13:27,622
I don't know.

242
00:13:31,152 --> 00:13:32,924
Get the stuff out...

243
00:13:34,506 --> 00:13:36,074
all right, I'm folding...

244
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:38,942
- I don't hear you approaching.
- You always talk to yourself?

245
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:41,231
Good.

246
00:13:41,356 --> 00:13:43,697
If these machines were on, I definitely
wouldn't hear you come up behind me.

247
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:46,549
- Jake Moreland, Providence P.D.
- Emily Prentiss.

248
00:13:46,674 --> 00:13:48,243
Great. Can you do that again?

249
00:13:49,434 --> 00:13:50,240
Sure.

250
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:51,529
OK.

251
00:13:52,691 --> 00:13:54,624
You come in through the back door,

252
00:13:54,749 --> 00:13:56,710
slash my throat, walk out.

253
00:13:57,071 --> 00:13:59,337
There's no cameras inside
or outside of the building.

254
00:13:59,795 --> 00:14:01,685
The same is true for
all the crime scenes.

255
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:04,468
Which means you're smart enough
to plan for that in your attacks.

256
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:05,358
But,

257
00:14:05,695 --> 00:14:08,054
careless enough to drop
a knife 10 feet after I cut you.

258
00:14:08,361 --> 00:14:10,309
But you didn't leave
any fingerprints.

259
00:14:10,925 --> 00:14:13,005
No. He did that at
all 3 crime scenes.

260
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:15,641
Mass murderers and spree killers,

261
00:14:15,978 --> 00:14:19,919
they often fetishize their weapons,
but this guy discards his. Why?

262
00:14:21,032 --> 00:14:23,153
He can get a new knife
anytime he wants.

263
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:25,119
They carry these at
army/navy stores.

264
00:14:25,778 --> 00:14:27,199
It could be a scare tactic.

265
00:14:27,712 --> 00:14:28,533
Hoso?

266
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:33,038
Americans typically are more terrified
by the presence of a knife than a gun.

267
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:37,709
They're more likely to scream
out for help if they see a gun,

268
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,878
whereas they'll comply
if they see a blade.

269
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,047
So, victimology

270
00:14:42,712 --> 00:14:45,884
and murder weapon aren't important
to this guy. What does that leave?

271
00:14:46,403 --> 00:14:47,636
What is he attacking?

272
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:49,239
The crime scene itself.

273
00:14:49,775 --> 00:14:52,641
Did you see the sign outside
when this place was established?

274
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:53,806
1967.

275
00:14:53,931 --> 00:14:56,728
The same as the restaurant.
Second generation Italian.

276
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,797
Everyone in
the neighborhood eats there.

277
00:14:58,922 --> 00:15:01,504
St. Alvina's was built at
the beginning of the last century.

278
00:15:01,629 --> 00:15:04,279
So each location has
a history in this community.

279
00:15:04,943 --> 00:15:07,146
So he wants to destroy landmarks,

280
00:15:07,271 --> 00:15:09,074
pieces of providence's history.

281
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,904
That's why the random victims.
He's making a point.

282
00:15:12,029 --> 00:15:14,892
Probably the manifestation of
a deep hatred for the city.

283
00:15:15,146 --> 00:15:18,416
He wants to scar the places
everybody knows and goes to.

284
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:19,435
Not quite.

285
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,173
Take a ride with me. We're gonna have
a look at the other crime scenes.

286
00:15:22,298 --> 00:15:23,099
Why?

287
00:15:23,439 --> 00:15:24,297
Indulge me.

288
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:37,227
Attack an institution,
everybody responds.

289
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:40,689
Neighbors come out,
the mayor assigns extra cops.

290
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:43,783
A place of worship turns
into a crime scene, you feel

291
00:15:44,045 --> 00:15:45,527
personally assaulted.

292
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:48,406
That's what gets him off.
The response. Public outcry.

293
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:49,990
He wants the big show.

294
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,437
You think he's revisiting
the crime scenes?

295
00:15:52,883 --> 00:15:54,277
Not just revisiting.

296
00:15:54,863 --> 00:15:55,829
Reliving.

297
00:15:56,129 --> 00:15:58,540
He's found a way to keep
the murders he's committed fresh

298
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,167
because they're always
on the city's mind.

299
00:16:05,081 --> 00:16:07,612
"Witnesses say they didn't see
it happen, were alerted by the

300
00:16:07,737 --> 00:16:09,944
screams of the victim's
wife and daughter."

301
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,002
Man alive, in a church.

302
00:16:13,588 --> 00:16:15,803
This guy,
he ain't afraid on nothing.

303
00:16:16,635 --> 00:16:18,674
Need anything?
I'm gonna grab a smoke.

304
00:16:19,038 --> 00:16:21,217
Careful, Connie,
those things'll kill ya.

305
00:17:01,012 --> 00:17:02,103
Careful, it's hot.

306
00:17:02,864 --> 00:17:05,357
Good. 'cause I love
my tea really warm.

307
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:07,901
{\pos(192,210)}Would you like some cream
and sugar with your tea, too?

308
00:17:08,337 --> 00:17:09,319
{\pos(192,210)}Please.

309
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:17,035
That's how miss tuffet
likes her tea, too.

310
00:17:19,027 --> 00:17:19,906
Thank you.

311
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,509
It's good.

312
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:25,044
But

313
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,796
I think Sophia's tea
is a little bit better.

314
00:17:28,889 --> 00:17:29,768
Thank you.

315
00:17:31,022 --> 00:17:32,276
How many do you have?

316
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,369
You're too good at
this not to be a mom.

317
00:17:35,494 --> 00:17:36,846
One. A boy.

318
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:40,725
Sophia's first communion is
supposed to be next week.

319
00:17:41,334 --> 00:17:42,352
She'll do great.

320
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:44,959
Excuse me.

321
00:17:49,284 --> 00:17:50,174
Hey, Rossi.

322
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:53,571
We're just getting ready to deliver the
profile, but I need you to do something.

323
00:17:57,219 --> 00:17:58,243
I understand.

324
00:17:59,868 --> 00:18:01,788
OK, call me when you find out more.

325
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:08,962
Sophia, mommy and agent
Jareau need some privacy, OK?

326
00:18:10,852 --> 00:18:12,903
- Thank you for the tea.
Y- ou're welcome.

327
00:18:20,482 --> 00:18:23,476
I know that tone of voice.
It's always followed by bad news.

328
00:18:24,942 --> 00:18:27,965
You should know a lot of these
guys need to feel powerful.

329
00:18:28,961 --> 00:18:30,918
Producing a spectacle gives them

330
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,524
that sense of pride.

331
00:18:32,828 --> 00:18:35,989
I'm trying to quell that by
controlling the circus outside.

332
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:38,324
Is he watching us?

333
00:18:40,246 --> 00:18:40,952
Maybe.

334
00:18:41,736 --> 00:18:44,255
We think he revisits
his crime scenes.

335
00:18:44,771 --> 00:18:47,417
It's possible the media
could have brought him here.

336
00:18:48,568 --> 00:18:51,296
He won't shake my daughter's
hand this time if he does.

337
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:54,345
We suggest that you've
think of this unsub here.

338
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:56,373
Not as a slasher but as an arsonist.

339
00:18:56,747 --> 00:18:59,853
Because the gratification he's getting
isn't from the physical act of murder

340
00:18:59,978 --> 00:19:01,704
but from the public's
reaction to it.

341
00:19:01,829 --> 00:19:05,239
Arsonists draw attention to
themselves through the fires they set.

342
00:19:05,364 --> 00:19:08,431
Pas de teste dans le tsssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss

343
00:19:08,556 --> 00:19:11,661
While this unsub will
never set an actual fire,

344
00:19:11,786 --> 00:19:13,785
he has the same psychosis
as one who does.

345
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:17,598
Our unsub fits that model. His locations
have been pillars of the community.

346
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:20,187
The victims he picks aren't
as important as the effect

347
00:19:20,312 --> 00:19:23,161
of killing them outside of your favorite
restaurant or place of worship

348
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,267
By picking locales wit
the highest visibility,

349
00:19:42,392 --> 00:19:44,634
he's creating the highest level
of fear in that neighborhood,

350
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:46,605
which reinforces his
feeling of power.

351
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:49,895
Yeah, but arsonists don't set out to
hurt people. This guy clearly does.

352
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:53,382
That's true. And this unsub definitely
falls in the category of sociopath.

353
00:19:53,507 --> 00:19:56,438
His victims are there
only to achieve his goal.

354
00:19:56,563 --> 00:19:58,759
He doesn't have the ability
to empathize with them.

355
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:01,533
To him,
they're just tools for him to use,

356
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,419
no different than a can
of gasoline and a match.

357
00:20:05,951 --> 00:20:08,750
I'll talk to you later, sweetie.
I'm just at the market right now.

358
00:20:09,788 --> 00:20:11,549
All right. I love you, too.

359
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:38,991
But even how he kills
tells us something.

360
00:20:39,212 --> 00:20:42,023
Slashing a throat is a messy,
visual act.

361
00:20:42,148 --> 00:20:45,060
It's designed to create attention,
just like a fire.

362
00:20:45,185 --> 00:20:47,328
Arsonists are often mission based.
They need make

363
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,171
sure their first fire has burnt
out before they set another one.

364
00:20:50,637 --> 00:20:52,167
- Are these organic?
- Yeah.

365
00:20:53,273 --> 00:20:54,961
You know, I think I have a fresher

366
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:56,920
bunch of those back in the truck.
Hold*n one second.

367
00:20:57,045 --> 00:21:00,341
They're also highly disciplined
and focused. If conditions aren't right

368
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,896
to set a fire, or in this case,
slash a throat, they'll move on.

369
00:21:03,021 --> 00:21:04,190
I'm sorry, I don't.

370
00:21:04,435 --> 00:21:07,682
Which actually makes this your lucky
day. If you want to get something else,

371
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,345
these hydrangeas are perfect.

372
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,667
They have to go home with somebody.
I'll give them to you for half.

373
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:13,980
They're beautiful.
absolutely, I'll take them.

374
00:21:14,489 --> 00:21:16,524
Blue for your eyes. How about that?

375
00:21:18,845 --> 00:21:21,492
In addition to his need to kill,
he has self-control.

376
00:21:22,075 --> 00:21:24,967
He has a short cooling off period
because he's enjoying what he's doing.

377
00:21:25,092 --> 00:21:27,871
This in turn feeds his ego
and keeps him covering his tracks.

378
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:29,877
This makes him even more dangerous.

379
00:21:30,002 --> 00:21:32,564
If he gets frustrated, encounters
too many obstacles, or suffers

380
00:21:32,689 --> 00:21:35,835
a blow to his narcissistic ego,
he could go on an

381
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,670
-all-out rampage.
- Focus on

382
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:40,567
men between jobs.
Instead of working consistently,

383
00:21:40,692 --> 00:21:42,643
he is hunting at his next location.

384
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:45,929
And he's revisiting his old scenes.
We recommend you...

385
00:21:48,296 --> 00:21:49,089
yeah.

386
00:21:49,544 --> 00:21:51,678
The news crews are
leaving the Collins house.

387
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:53,061
He's killed again.

388
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:55,153
Yeah. Farmers market
at third and Shelby.

389
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:57,797
- The press are already on their way.
- We could use that.

390
00:21:57,922 --> 00:22:00,199
It'll feed his ego.
He'll want to stay and watch.

391
00:22:00,455 --> 00:22:02,438
Ladies and gentlemen, when you get to the crime scene,

392
00:22:02,563 --> 00:22:04,082
we need you to canvass the crowd.

393
00:22:04,207 --> 00:22:06,485
Pay particular attention to onlookers who might be more

394
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:09,994
interested in the scene itself than the
victim. And get photographs of everyone.

395
00:22:10,404 --> 00:22:12,664
Excuse me.
JJ, I need you there.

396
00:22:13,114 --> 00:22:14,958
No, Hotch,
I can't leave.

397
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:17,091
JJ, you're there to
control the media.

398
00:22:17,216 --> 00:22:20,058
They've left to cover the crime scene,
which may distract the unsub.

399
00:22:20,396 --> 00:22:21,589
We can catch him,

400
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,883
but I need you on top of
the press making sure they're

401
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,007
focud on our goals
and not the unsub's.

402
00:22:30,531 --> 00:22:31,766
Yeah. I'm on my way.

403
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:40,325
I'm so sorry.

404
00:22:42,074 --> 00:22:44,529
It's OK.
I know that tone of voice, too.

405
00:22:56,087 --> 00:22:57,195
Somebody died?

406
00:22:57,697 --> 00:22:58,933
Ho, my god.

407
00:22:59,248 --> 00:23:00,211
What happened?

408
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,236
I bet it was that stabber.

409
00:23:04,367 --> 00:23:05,697
Stabber? What stabber?

410
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:09,469
You know, the *y who's been cutting
people's throats open around town.

411
00:23:10,542 --> 00:23:11,789
Right. Him.

412
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,686
- Come with me, sir.
- What?

413
00:23:17,517 --> 00:23:18,893
- What?
- Come on.

414
00:23:19,018 --> 00:23:21,649
- Let's go. Providence police.
- Go ahead, Emily.

415
00:23:24,155 --> 00:23:27,155
Hey, Rossi, I got a trail of blood here,
but I haven't found the knife yet.

416
00:23:27,571 --> 00:23:29,532
He ran away.
See where it ends.

417
00:23:30,032 --> 00:23:30,977
Got it.

418
00:23:46,912 --> 00:23:48,259
We can't run this locally.

419
00:23:48,742 --> 00:23:51,565
Run? It's ran, it's gone.
CNN's leading with this in 3 hours.

420
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:52,847
Minimize his impact.

421
00:23:53,314 --> 00:23:55,850
Do not give him a name.
It'll just encourage him to kill more.

422
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,895
Am I making this deal for full access?

423
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:01,435
Of course.

424
00:24:02,205 --> 00:24:05,307
Just attribute the good work to the
providence P.D. And leave us out of it.

425
00:24:11,161 --> 00:24:13,762
He was just a nice
guy who worked here.

426
00:24:14,193 --> 00:24:16,584
I'd en him here before
but never bought anything from him.

427
00:24:16,709 --> 00:24:18,092
What do you remember
about the attack?

428
00:24:18,217 --> 00:24:19,707
I asked if his flowers were organic.

429
00:24:19,993 --> 00:24:21,159
I turned away,

430
00:24:21,284 --> 00:24:24,045
and the next thing I know I felt
something warm. It was blood.

431
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:26,207
Did you get a look at
the guy with the knife?

432
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:28,236
The first person I saw was
a guy screaming for help

433
00:24:28,361 --> 00:24:30,055
he was trying to stop the bleeding.

434
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,202
A bunch of people ran over
there trying to help, and

435
00:24:32,327 --> 00:24:34,056
I think I just stood
there screaming.

436
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:35,829
Back up for a second.
Who was shouting?

437
00:24:35,954 --> 00:24:36,891
I don't know, some guy.

438
00:24:37,298 --> 00:24:39,798
When I turned around,
he was holding the poor man up,

439
00:24:39,923 --> 00:24:41,354
trying to get someone to notice.

440
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:43,308
This guy must have got
a lot of blood on him, yeah?

441
00:24:43,433 --> 00:24:44,649
Yeah, sure, I guess.

442
00:24:44,963 --> 00:24:46,595
All right, thank you for your time.

443
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,528
Officer.

444
00:24:48,706 --> 00:24:49,779
Go ahead, Emily.

445
00:24:49,904 --> 00:24:51,742
I found out where
that blood trail ended.

446
00:24:51,867 --> 00:24:52,279
And?

447
00:24:52,404 --> 00:24:54,226
The unsub changed his clothes.

448
00:24:54,351 --> 00:24:56,559
He left his blood soaked
ones here in the trash.

449
00:24:56,684 --> 00:24:59,330
He's avoided getting blood on
himself up to now. What changed?

450
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,833
I don't know, but whatever his reason,
he came prepared.

451
00:25:02,291 --> 00:25:04,227
He knew he would be
bloody this time.

452
00:25:05,889 --> 00:25:07,242
I'll get back to you.

453
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,170
What do you got, Morgan?

454
00:25:09,295 --> 00:25:12,016
A witness says the first responder,
a citizen, cried out for help

455
00:25:12,141 --> 00:25:14,971
- maybe 2 seconds after the stabbing.
- He was the unsub.

456
00:25:15,565 --> 00:25:16,430
I think so.

457
00:25:17,548 --> 00:25:20,351
He's not content with revisiting
the crime scene anymore,

458
00:25:20,476 --> 00:25:22,912
e needs to be part of them.
Detective!

459
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,183
Yeah.

460
00:25:24,308 --> 00:25:27,567
Establish a perimeter around the market.
Put your men no more an 20 feet apart.

461
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:29,770
Every cop needs to be
in sight of one another.

462
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:32,209
- Wait a minute. What?
- The unsub is still here.

463
00:25:32,334 --> 00:25:32,900
Are you sure?

464
00:25:33,025 --> 00:25:34,991
Start by separating
the men from the women.

465
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:37,348
We found discarded clothes.
That's how we find him.

466
00:25:37,473 --> 00:25:39,297
- We match by body type.
- All right, I'm on it.

467
00:25:39,422 --> 00:25:40,663
Gardella, come on.

468
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,004
Copy that.

469
00:25:50,918 --> 00:25:52,097
Connor, is that you?

470
00:25:53,649 --> 00:25:54,510
Hey, Liddy.

471
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:57,000
- What are you going?
- I gotta get back to the diner.

472
00:25:57,385 --> 00:26:00,023
Well, you're gonna be late.
We gotta detain everyone inside here.

473
00:26:00,148 --> 00:26:01,934
Come on.
How many hamburgers have let slide?

474
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:03,895
Just following orders, buddy.
Let's go.

475
00:26:06,177 --> 00:26:07,870
You gotta explain to
Sally when I'm late.

476
00:26:07,995 --> 00:26:10,508
Yeah, yeah,
your customers won't starve.

477
00:26:39,102 --> 00:26:41,101
Those gotta be on the board, too?

478
00:26:41,143 --> 00:26:43,851
What's the next great bit
of advice from the FBI?

479
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:46,062
Take it easy, Gardella.
This ain't the time or the place.

480
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,709
If we hadn't listened to them, Liddy and
I would be hav*g our morning cup of coffee.

481
00:26:48,751 --> 00:26:52,075
We profiled that he was mission oriented,
and this kill doesn't fit that pattern.

482
00:26:52,117 --> 00:26:54,553
The murder of officer Liddy
is a significant departure

483
00:26:54,595 --> 00:26:57,073
even for someone as
unpredictable as this unsub.

484
00:26:57,319 --> 00:27:00,654
This was a murder of self-preservation,
just to get away.

485
00:27:00,696 --> 00:27:02,702
This location is not his MO,

486
00:27:02,744 --> 00:27:05,914
secluded with no audience,
stabbing, not cutting.

487
00:27:05,956 --> 00:27:08,169
- So?
- So he's out prowling the streets

488
00:27:08,211 --> 00:27:11,519
right now looking for another victim
so the city will pay attention to him.

489
00:27:11,561 --> 00:27:13,391
You've been handed a list of locations

490
00:27:13,433 --> 00:27:15,925
that we think might be of
particular interest to the unsub.

491
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:19,304
We're asking you to double and even
triple your surveillance in these areas.

492
00:27:19,824 --> 00:27:21,420
Keep your wits about you, guys.

493
00:27:21,462 --> 00:27:23,138
Detective, we'd like to speak to you.

494
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:23,933
Sure.

495
00:27:24,387 --> 00:27:25,987
That's it, fellas. Thank you.

496
00:27:27,236 --> 00:27:30,123
Detective, the story has
become about officer Liddy.

497
00:27:30,208 --> 00:27:32,442
We need to get the
attention back on the unsub

498
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:34,319
or we're afraid that he may lash out.

499
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:36,904
Up till now, the unsub has
been disciplined enough

500
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:39,003
to avoid killing if the
circumstances weren't right.

501
00:27:39,045 --> 00:27:41,358
Like an arsonist who won't set
a fire if there's someone there

502
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,110
to see him leaving while smoke
is billowing out the windows.

503
00:27:44,152 --> 00:27:47,345
What if we say that one of
the buildings didn't burn?

504
00:27:47,387 --> 00:27:49,292
How would the unsub react to that?

505
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,601
He'd be compelled to come
back and finish the job.

506
00:27:51,643 --> 00:27:54,311
Then we pick one of the previous locations,

507
00:27:54,353 --> 00:27:58,509
show that the community has rallied
around it, that not afraid of him.

508
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:00,432
So we need to find a location

509
00:28:00,474 --> 00:28:02,638
with the greatest symbolism
up to this point.

510
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,030
That's easy.

511
00:28:05,571 --> 00:28:08,496
And we use the city's fallen hero

512
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:10,272
as inspiration.

513
00:28:10,849 --> 00:28:12,899
Should we get the chief
of police or the mayor

514
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:15,307
to make a statement?
It could help with inspiring people.

515
00:28:15,349 --> 00:28:16,778
We've got something better.

516
00:28:17,141 --> 00:28:18,655
Captain Collins' widow.

517
00:28:20,207 --> 00:28:21,991
I... I cannot ask her to do that.

518
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,243
She's highly visible, and she's someone

519
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:26,037
with whom the entire city can sympathize.

520
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:29,374
When she tells the city not to
be afraid to come back to church,

521
00:28:29,936 --> 00:28:31,751
the unsub can't ignore that.

522
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:34,253
And what happens if this
draws the unsub to Meg?

523
00:28:35,732 --> 00:28:37,596
We keep her with us.

524
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,088
We'll take the bastard down.

525
00:28:45,485 --> 00:28:46,988
You want me to read this,

526
00:28:47,135 --> 00:28:48,309
in front of cameras?

527
00:28:48,551 --> 00:28:49,394
Yes.

528
00:28:51,322 --> 00:28:53,116
Will my husband's killer be there?

529
00:28:53,244 --> 00:28:54,982
Most likely he'll watch it on TV.

530
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:58,486
You'll have police protection
around you at all times.

531
00:28:59,541 --> 00:29:00,446
No.

532
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:02,622
I won't do it.

533
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,534
Meg, please.

534
00:29:04,922 --> 00:29:06,079
We need you.

535
00:29:06,207 --> 00:29:08,064
You represent Paul's memory.

536
00:29:08,132 --> 00:29:09,580
I represent Sophia.

537
00:29:10,283 --> 00:29:11,577
Paul's given enough.

538
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,011
So have I.

539
00:29:23,391 --> 00:29:24,305
Yes, sir.

540
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:26,428
No, I understand. Thank you.

541
00:29:28,092 --> 00:29:31,158
That was the mayor. He won't sign off
on a press conference at St. Alvina.

542
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,500
And JJ couldn't make any
headway with Meg Collins.

543
00:29:37,269 --> 00:29:40,449
How long has it been since
officer Liddy was stabbed?

544
00:29:41,338 --> 00:29:42,338
16 hours.

545
00:29:43,245 --> 00:29:45,640
Well, if the unsub was
going to go out on a spree,

546
00:29:45,682 --> 00:29:48,212
he would have done it
by now. Why hasn't he?

547
00:29:48,609 --> 00:29:50,859
- He killed a cop. He's laying low.
- Maybe.

548
00:29:50,901 --> 00:29:53,503
But we've profiled
this guy like an arsonist.

549
00:29:53,724 --> 00:29:56,127
It's the aftermath that matters,
not the act.

550
00:29:57,296 --> 00:30:00,106
You think he's feeding off the grief
of the police department instead?

551
00:30:00,294 --> 00:30:02,508
If so, then he's found
something new to get off on.

552
00:30:03,942 --> 00:30:05,034
Detective.

553
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,766
Hold on a second.
Yeah?

554
00:30:06,808 --> 00:30:09,703
I need a list of establishments
where your officers socialize

555
00:30:09,745 --> 00:30:12,059
bars, restaurants, pool halls,
everything you've got.

556
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,228
Sure, right.
Eddie, let me get back to you.

557
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,545
Another round, guys?

558
00:30:15,587 --> 00:30:17,916
Yeah.
We're off the clock anyways.

559
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,228
One more for liddy, boys.

560
00:30:31,428 --> 00:30:32,916
Here's to a great cop.

561
00:30:34,812 --> 00:30:36,969
We'll get this bastard for you, Joe.

562
00:30:38,576 --> 00:30:40,338
Yeah, the FBI gonna
help you do that?

563
00:30:42,633 --> 00:30:45,356
We don't need a profile to know
the kind of guy we're dealing with.

564
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:46,594
A coward.

565
00:30:47,238 --> 00:30:49,078
He stabs a cop in the dark

566
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,933
and runs away like a vermin.

567
00:30:51,389 --> 00:30:52,668
Gutless.

568
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,043
No kiddin'.

569
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:57,802
Comrades, I have amassed
employment records

570
00:30:57,844 --> 00:31:00,033
for police hangouts.
What do you want me to look for?

571
00:31:00,075 --> 00:31:02,534
- White males 25 to 30.
- I'm gonna need more than that.

572
00:31:02,576 --> 00:31:04,699
Arsonists typically have
a stronger relationship

573
00:31:04,741 --> 00:31:06,531
with their mothers
than their fathers, so

574
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:09,273
let's look for single-mother
households with a history of abuse,

575
00:31:09,315 --> 00:31:11,440
bad divorce, or paternal violence.

576
00:31:11,482 --> 00:31:13,462
Manifestations in the son, too, Garcia,

577
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:15,371
like juvenile arrests, heavy crimes,

578
00:31:15,413 --> 00:31:17,066
a significant drop in grades.

579
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:18,833
Thank you, boys.
That will do.

580
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:24,186
- Oh, this looks like something.
- What do you have?

581
00:31:25,864 --> 00:31:27,093
Connor O'Brien.

582
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:29,345
His dad went to prison for...

583
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:31,695
oh, lord*y... not only setting
mom's apartment on fire

584
00:31:31,737 --> 00:31:33,513
but making it look like
it was an accident

585
00:31:33,555 --> 00:31:35,414
so he could collect on the insurance.

586
00:31:35,456 --> 00:31:37,248
R*ned his kid's mother for a few bucks?

587
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:40,176
Yeah. And then Connor testified
*****.

588
00:31:40,218 --> 00:31:42,149
- He was 10.
- Where's O'Brien now?

589
00:31:44,229 --> 00:31:45,987
He works at the quality cafe.

590
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,573
Guys, it's across the street.

591
00:31:49,026 --> 00:31:50,449
Thanks, Garcia.

592
00:31:52,049 --> 00:31:54,287
FBI.
Where's Connor O'Brien?

593
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:56,935
Connie? He just stepped
out about 10 minutes ago.

594
00:31:56,977 --> 00:32:00,228
- Did you see which way he went?
- He just went out to grab a smoke. Why

595
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:02,983
Garcia, I need O'Brien's home address.

596
00:32:03,025 --> 00:32:05,586
- What are you guys doing here?
- We were done with our shifts.

597
00:32:05,628 --> 00:32:07,041
We poured one out for Liddy.

598
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:08,923
Did you talk to him
about the recent murders?

599
00:32:08,965 --> 00:32:10,845
Of course.
We said we'd catch the coward.

600
00:32:11,238 --> 00:32:12,388
You disparaged him.

601
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:16,264
- 1121 Admiral, apartment 16.
- It's the other side of town.

602
00:32:16,306 --> 00:32:18,822
Dave, you and Morgan meet
Prentiss and SWAT. On site.

603
00:32:36,547 --> 00:32:37,765
Connor O'Brien!

604
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,677
Clear!

605
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:46,272
He's not coming back here.

606
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:48,750
He's gonna make his last stand.

607
00:32:48,792 --> 00:32:51,453
He's still gonna need to know
he's foremost on everyone's mind.

608
00:32:51,495 --> 00:32:52,502
Guys!

609
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:59,386
It looks like he's got every article that
was printed about his mom's death.

610
00:33:00,241 --> 00:33:02,563
He has the prayer card from her funeral.

611
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:04,899
Birthday cards.

612
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:08,041
Look, all of them signed
by his mom, not by his father.

613
00:33:10,153 --> 00:33:11,257
Look at this.

614
00:33:12,236 --> 00:33:13,482
That's a lot of hate.

615
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:16,276
His old man is already in prison.
He can't attack him.

616
00:33:16,318 --> 00:33:18,621
So he goes after the places
that remind him of his father.

617
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:21,824
The only way he can get through
to his dad is with violence.

618
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,818
William O'Brien, aka Billy Os.

619
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:32,521
Was a connected guy who specialized
in turning faulty wiring

620
00:33:32,563 --> 00:33:33,886
into a 3-alarm fire.

621
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,802
Because of Connor's testimony,
he was given a life sentence

622
00:33:36,844 --> 00:33:39,712
for the murder of his wife,
but it was recently reduced

623
00:33:39,754 --> 00:33:41,477
to the*ossibility of parole in 5 years.

624
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,906
- When was the sentence reduced?
- One month ago.

625
00:33:43,948 --> 00:33:46,834
Just before the murders started.
There's our stressor.

626
00:33:46,876 --> 00:33:49,959
Why would he do this to get back
at his father if he's already in jail?

627
00:33:50,001 --> 00:33:51,907
Somebody's gotta pay.

628
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,698
He's a tough guy now.

629
00:34:04,773 --> 00:34:05,982
Hey, wake up.

630
00:34:06,619 --> 00:34:07,619
Wake up!

631
00:34:09,346 --> 00:34:11,048
Your mother's dead.

632
00:34:22,981 --> 00:34:24,134
Time to go.

633
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:27,062
- But, dad, you said I could...
- I said let's go!

634
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:33,630
It's OK, honey.

635
00:34:35,329 --> 00:34:37,742
Just give me one more minute,
we'll be out of here.

636
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:54,653
Yeah, thanks, Eddie.

637
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:56,906
Damn it.

638
00:34:59,584 --> 00:35:01,987
- Where?
- Library about a mile from here.

639
00:35:02,029 --> 00:35:04,001
Mother was found next
to her crying baby.

640
00:35:04,043 --> 00:35:05,300
Is the baby OK?

641
00:35:05,342 --> 00:35:07,452
Not a scratch, but they
haven't found the knife yet.

642
00:35:07,494 --> 00:35:10,944
It's his memento now. He won't stop until
he's killed as may people as possible.

643
00:35:10,986 --> 00:35:14,715
We have to go to our original plan create
an event he can't resist coming to.

644
00:35:14,757 --> 00:35:16,705
He has to believe he was unsuccessful.

645
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:19,177
If he won't go bk to his apartment,
and I don't think he's gonna

646
00:35:19,219 --> 00:35:21,731
- revisit the crime scenes.
- The mother from the library?

647
00:35:21,773 --> 00:35:22,940
She's already gone.

648
00:35:22,982 --> 00:35:25,403
She bled out at the scene.
The emts stopped working on her.

649
00:35:25,445 --> 00:35:27,640
Tell them to keep trying to resuscitate her.

650
00:35:27,682 --> 00:35:30,412
- But she's dead.
- Yeah, but the unsub doesn't know that.

651
00:35:30,454 --> 00:35:33,495
Tell the press she made it,
she's hanging on for dear life.

652
00:35:33,537 --> 00:35:36,145
And we organize a candlelight
vigil for her tonight.

653
00:35:36,187 --> 00:35:38,390
If he's mission oriented and
he thinks she's still alive,

654
00:35:38,432 --> 00:35:40,581
- he'll have to come back for her.
- And we'll be there.

655
00:35:40,623 --> 00:35:42,684
Let the husband know what's
going on so he's aware.

656
00:35:42,726 --> 00:35:44,588
Have the press there.
Tell them to go live

657
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:47,019
and to keep the focus on
us as much as they can.

658
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:53,192
Mrs. Collins.

659
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,146
The woman who was just attacked...

660
00:36:03,018 --> 00:36:04,203
she was a mother?

661
00:36:05,674 --> 00:36:06,667
Yes.

662
00:36:08,495 --> 00:36:09,902
What can I do to help?

663
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,287
We are live at the latest crime scene,

664
00:36:12,329 --> 00:36:15,216
where the FBI is facilitating
what appears to be...

665
00:36:15,258 --> 00:36:17,035
Officer!
Move this crowd to that corner

666
00:36:17,077 --> 00:36:18,849
and pin them behind the police barricades.

667
00:36:18,891 --> 00:36:22,073
We've got a female about 30, her throat's
been slashed, she's hanging on.

668
00:36:22,115 --> 00:36:24,353
There's a vascular surgeon
standing by at the hospital.

669
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:33,178
- Yeah, one, two is your change.
- Thank you.

670
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:43,065
Can I help you?

671
00:36:43,107 --> 00:36:45,452
A pack of smokes.
Uh, c-could you turn that up?

672
00:36:47,484 --> 00:36:49,748
... crime scene,
where the FBI is facilitating

673
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:53,250
what appears to be a rescue
attempt of the most recent victim.

674
00:36:53,292 --> 00:36:55,225
They are rushing her into
an ambulance now.

675
00:36:55,319 --> 00:36:56,589
Make some room, please!

676
00:36:57,065 --> 00:36:58,257
Right this way, guys.

677
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,525
- How's she doing?
- We've got her stabilized, sir.

678
00:37:00,567 --> 00:37:02,434
They're coming through.
Please clear it out.

679
00:37:02,476 --> 00:37:04,430
Can we clear a path, please.

680
00:37:06,647 --> 00:37:10,110
Officers, I want a 5-car escort
for the ambulance to the hospital.

681
00:37:10,152 --> 00:37:13,668
As you can see, she is still alive
and being rushed to the hospital now.

682
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:14,999
Looks like she's OK.

683
00:37:15,111 --> 00:37:17,223
No, no, that's im... that's not possible.

684
00:37:17,265 --> 00:37:18,569
As many of you know,

685
00:37:19,071 --> 00:37:21,110
my husband captain Paul Collins

686
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:23,456
was murdered this past Sunday.

687
00:37:24,097 --> 00:37:27,451
The support I have received
has been inspiring.

688
00:37:28,149 --> 00:37:29,950
Which is why I'm asking everyone

689
00:37:29,992 --> 00:37:32,291
to support the latest victim,
Julia Vecchia,

690
00:37:32,543 --> 00:37:35,711
who is fighting for her life right
now at st. Frazier's hospital.

691
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,686
It's that wife of the
soldier who got killed.

692
00:37:37,728 --> 00:37:40,559
On behalf of my husband,
we are asking you to come together

693
00:37:40,601 --> 00:37:43,688
at St. Frazier's to hold
a candlelight vigil tonight.

694
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:45,735
Please help restore this great city

695
00:37:45,777 --> 00:37:48,265
look at her. Kid's got a lot of heart.

696
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,433
Thank you.

697
00:38:09,652 --> 00:38:11,846
- You think this'll work?
- It should.

698
00:38:12,316 --> 00:38:15,023
We've shifted the public's focus
from Connor to his victim.

699
00:38:15,065 --> 00:38:17,123
That should make him angry
enough to show up

700
00:38:17,165 --> 00:38:18,800
and try to do something about it.

701
00:38:27,524 --> 00:38:29,098
*********

702
00:38:37,435 --> 00:38:38,649
Connor O'Brien?

703
00:38:38,919 --> 00:38:40,275
Roll in now. Go, go.

704
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:43,416
Put your hands where I can see
them and get down on the ground!

705
00:38:43,458 --> 00:38:45,107
Hey! FBI!

706
00:38:45,779 --> 00:38:47,199
Stop right there!

707
00:38:50,056 --> 00:38:51,745
Stop! Moving! Stop fighting!

708
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,673
Stop fighting!

709
00:38:53,931 --> 00:38:54,915
Stop!

710
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,284
That's enough! It's over!
That's enough!

711
00:38:58,052 --> 00:39:00,629
She's dead! There no possible
way she could have survived!

712
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,587
Connor O'Brien, you're under arrest.

713
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:05,323
We know why you came down here.

714
00:39:05,547 --> 00:39:06,384
Do you?

715
00:39:06,426 --> 00:39:07,801
I had to make sure.

716
00:39:08,301 --> 00:39:10,302
She... she's dead, right?

717
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:13,352
What are you smiling at?
You're going to jail.

718
00:39:13,512 --> 00:39:15,477
In jail they treat cop killers like kings.

719
00:39:15,682 --> 00:39:17,895
First you gotta see how we
treat 'em at the station.

720
00:39:17,937 --> 00:39:19,380
Get him out of here.

721
00:39:31,957 --> 00:39:34,452
It's hard to believe that guy
was so starved for attention

722
00:39:34,494 --> 00:39:37,124
that he murdered all those
people just to one-up s father.

723
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:40,902
I spok with detective Moreland
about Connor's father Billy Os.

724
00:39:41,193 --> 00:39:44,943
He said the older police knew
to give him a wide berth.

725
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:47,508
He didn't say much, but when he did...

726
00:39:48,104 --> 00:39:49,379
people listened.

727
00:39:50,711 --> 00:39:52,964
The adult version of a bully.

728
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:55,777
There are lots of ways that
sons defeat their fathers.

729
00:39:55,819 --> 00:39:57,542
I just keep getting Ph. D.S.

730
00:39:57,616 --> 00:40:00,564
Does the son of a sociopath
ever really have a chance?

731
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:05,227
You know, O'Brien committed his crimes
in the same jurisdiction as his father.

732
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:08,113
It's only a matter of time before
he's put in the same prison.

733
00:41:55,595 --> 00:41:57,264
William Shakespeare wrote,

734
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:01,158
"When a father gives to his son,
they both laugh.

735
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,851
"When a son gives to his father,

736
00:42:04,233 --> 00:42:05,357
both cry."

737
00:42:08,512 --> 00:42:09,424
Hey, dad.

738
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:16,033
Well, well, well.
Does your mother know you're here?
