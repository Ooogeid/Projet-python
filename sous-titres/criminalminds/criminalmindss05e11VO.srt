Your mom, she's gonna
meet us at the hospital.

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,967

You're gonna be fine.

Let me say good-bye to her.

00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:46,864

He comes out of prison a murderer.

66
00:03:06,313 --> 00:03:07,680
He killed an innocent woman.

67
00:03:07,681 --> 00:03:09,048
How do you know she's innocent?

68
00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:10,683
You stabbed her and threw
her out of a truck.

00:03:10,684 --> 00:03:12,050
What the hell did she ever do to you?

You know, what I don't get

71
00:03:13,686 --> 00:03:16,287
Is why you couldn't just
appreciate the freedom.

72
00:03:16,288 --> 00:03:19,756
You could have holed up
in that cabin a long time,

73
00:03:19,757 --> 00:03:22,191
Enjoyed the quiet.

00:03:22,192 --> 00:03:24,693
But some people just need the distractions.

75
00:03:24,694 --> 00:03:28,096

00:03:28,097 --> 00:03:31,365
It's madness for the sheep
to talk peace with a wolf.

I'm surprised.

81
00:03:39,373 --> 00:03:40,873

00:08:50,778 --> 00:08:52,279
You know, this wouldn't be such a big deal

185
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,447
If you hadn't killed a cop.

186
00:08:53,448 --> 00:08:56,451
Oh, he didn't know when to shut up.

187
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,686
You know what's gonna happen now?

188
00:08:58,687 --> 00:09:00,387
They're gonna put your picture everywhere.

189
00:09:00,388 --> 00:09:01,955
They're gonna triple patrol.

190
00:09:01,956 --> 00:09:04,824
You just screwed your chances
of ever getting out of here.

191
00:09:04,825 --> 00:09:08,193
Well, see, that's where you come in.

192
00:09:08,194 --> 00:09:11,295
I got faith in you.

193
00:09:12,697 --> 00:09:15,765
Is this gonna leave a scar?

194
00:09:16,701 --> 00:09:18,602
No, we gotta find schrader.

195
00:09:18,603 --> 00:09:19,703
The team's got it covered.

196
00:09:19,704 --> 00:09:21,038
Don't make me stay here.

197
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:22,973
I'm fine, honestly. Pull this thing over.

198
00:09:22,974 --> 00:09:25,041
Prentiss, you can't even focus.
You have a concussion.

199
00:09:25,042 --> 00:09:26,276
I saw the guy.

200
00:09:26,277 --> 00:09:27,343
White, 40s, I know.

201
00:09:27,344 --> 00:09:28,878
Ok, so give me a cognitive interview.

202
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:30,012
Your adrenaline's pumping.

203
00:09:30,013 --> 00:09:31,013
Exactly.

204
00:09:31,014 --> 00:09:32,081
Emily, you're in shock.

205
00:09:32,082 --> 00:09:34,082
It just happened. It'll never be clearer.

206
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,850
How many shots did you fire? 3.

207
00:09:35,851 --> 00:09:37,185
You emptied your clip.

208
00:09:37,186 --> 00:09:38,386
No...

209
00:09:38,387 --> 00:09:40,388
I did?

210
00:09:42,191 --> 00:09:44,959
All right, so schrader pulled
a series of bank heists

211
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,193
In the 1990s.

212
00:09:46,194 --> 00:09:48,329
He was the only one to ever
go away for the crimes.

213
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:51,098
He was a model prisoner,
only served 11 of his 15 years,

214
00:09:51,099 --> 00:09:53,166
Was released early on good behavior,

215
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:56,102
And any friends he had are
either dead or still in prison.

216
00:09:56,103 --> 00:09:58,237
A 3-ton truck was found
north of the accident,

217
00:09:58,238 --> 00:09:59,805
Not too far from canada.

218
00:09:59,806 --> 00:10:01,573
We have the heaviest
presence at border crossings.

219
00:10:01,574 --> 00:10:02,808
He probably knows that.

220
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:04,342
I don't think he's gonna sit still for long.

221
00:10:04,343 --> 00:10:06,543
He might have to depending
on how injured he is.

222
00:10:06,544 --> 00:10:07,711
Rossi: What do we know?

223
00:10:07,712 --> 00:10:09,012
Dale schrader went to prison for robbery.

224
00:10:09,013 --> 00:10:10,847
He was hands off.
All of his crimes were impersonal.

225
00:10:10,848 --> 00:10:12,848
2 days after he's released,
he kills stacy ryan

226
00:10:12,849 --> 00:10:14,282
And he kidnaps his daughter.

227
00:10:14,283 --> 00:10:16,484
It's both personal and emotional.

228
00:10:16,485 --> 00:10:18,019
When he's not attached to the crime,
he pulls it off,

229
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,854
But the minute he's invested,
like with his daughter,

230
00:10:19,855 --> 00:10:22,056
He lets his guard down and
gets caught. It makes sense.

231
00:10:22,057 --> 00:10:23,624
So he's not the hard-ass we thought he was.

232
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,192
But if jenny were what he wanted,

233
00:10:25,193 --> 00:10:26,927
He had her. He could have left.

234
00:10:26,928 --> 00:10:28,729
Yeah, we thought he took her
and ran to canada, right?

235
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,097
That theory made sense. Why didn't he?

236
00:10:30,098 --> 00:10:31,198
Pictures from the accident.

237
00:10:31,199 --> 00:10:32,299
Any word on emily?

238
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,268
Apparently she's arguing with the doctors.

239
00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:35,235
That's good.

240
00:10:35,236 --> 00:10:36,503
This took a lot to pull off.

241
00:10:36,504 --> 00:10:39,239
What if he's got a group of guys to call on?

242
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,508
I agree. All those bank jobs were a solo,

243
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:44,410
But this is a lot for
one man to orchestrate.

244
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:46,079
Jj: Figured out why he killed stacy ryan?

245
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,914
We haven't found any connection to schrader,

246
00:10:47,915 --> 00:10:49,917
But he may be connected to the partner.

247
00:10:49,918 --> 00:10:51,885
How? Killing her might
have been advance payment

248
00:10:51,886 --> 00:10:53,587
For breaking him out of custody.

249
00:10:53,588 --> 00:10:55,255
Garcia, I need everything
you've got on stacy ryan.

250
00:10:55,256 --> 00:10:56,356
What do you mean he got away?

251
00:10:56,357 --> 00:10:58,225
Somebody broke him out of custody.

252
00:10:58,226 --> 00:10:59,426
Oh, god.

253
00:10:59,427 --> 00:11:00,861
We're gonna keep the two of you here.

254
00:11:00,862 --> 00:11:02,698
There's gonna be an officer
standing watch the entire time.

255
00:11:02,699 --> 00:11:04,500
If you can't find him,
how long will you keep us safe?

256
00:11:04,501 --> 00:11:05,835
Ma'am, we will find him.

257
00:11:05,836 --> 00:11:07,971
You don't know dale.
When he wants something, he gets it.

258
00:11:07,972 --> 00:11:10,241
Can you think of anyone at all
who might want to help him?

259
00:11:10,242 --> 00:11:11,709
He doesn't trust anybody.

260
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,910
It's not necessarily about trust.

261
00:11:12,911 --> 00:11:14,379
Maybe somebody who's indebted to him

262
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,914
And he was trying to collect on it?

263
00:11:15,915 --> 00:11:17,281
I don't know.

264
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,283
Jenny...

265
00:11:21,886 --> 00:11:24,253
You and your dad were alone the entire time?

266
00:11:24,254 --> 00:11:27,086
Nobody was in the truck or the cabin?

267
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:28,053
Nobody.

268
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:29,721
Who would do this for dale?

269
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:32,556
Who would risk everything to help him?

270
00:11:32,557 --> 00:11:35,456
That's what we need to find out.

271
00:11:35,457 --> 00:11:37,323
Stacy ryan had two times in her life--

272
00:11:37,324 --> 00:11:39,893
When she was high and when
she was waiting to get high.

273
00:11:39,894 --> 00:11:41,494
The only thread I have between them

274
00:11:41,495 --> 00:11:44,295
Is that her brother spent time
with schrader upstate like...

275
00:11:44,296 --> 00:11:45,396
5 years ago.

276
00:11:45,397 --> 00:11:47,098
Why would schrader kill a junkie?

277
00:11:47,099 --> 00:11:48,899
It doesn't make sense.

278
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,700
Where's the brother now? Dead.

279
00:11:50,701 --> 00:11:53,098
It doesn't feel like schrader
does anything randomly.

280
00:11:53,099 --> 00:11:55,266
Stacy must have meant something to him.

281
00:11:55,267 --> 00:11:58,102
Garcia: Yeah, but...What?

282
00:12:00,605 --> 00:12:03,106
Never mind, I see her.

283
00:12:05,643 --> 00:12:07,677
I can take her from here. Thanks.

284
00:12:07,678 --> 00:12:08,745
Thk you.

285
00:12:08,746 --> 00:12:10,479
I can walk. Sit.

286
00:12:11,381 --> 00:12:12,881
I like pushing you around.

287
00:12:12,882 --> 00:12:15,383
[chuckles]

288
00:12:15,384 --> 00:12:16,618
Does it hurt?

289
00:12:16,619 --> 00:12:18,876
If by "it" you mean my
entire body, then yes.

290
00:12:28,877 --> 00:12:30,992
Ok, so the partner saw
everything in the woods,

291
00:12:30,993 --> 00:12:32,666
He ran away and stole a truck?

292
00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:33,912
Who is this guy?

293
00:12:33,913 --> 00:12:35,553
He knew you were taking that
road back to the station.

294
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:37,099
He waited for you and he crashed into you.

295
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,372
This whole thing feels meticulous.

296
00:12:38,373 --> 00:12:40,792
Ok, so he needs the partner
for something else.

297
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:42,165
For what, though?

298
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,245
Well, I don't know. I mean,
he was locked up all this time.

299
00:12:44,246 --> 00:12:45,552
He planned the whole day.

300
00:12:45,553 --> 00:12:47,538
He should have had backup
plans for his backup plans.

301
00:12:47,539 --> 00:12:49,212
His ex shouldn't have
been home for a few hours,

302
00:12:49,213 --> 00:12:50,625
So he clearly had enough time

303
00:12:50,626 --> 00:12:52,738
To get across the border with
jenny until we showed up.

304
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:54,278
But he stayed local, holed up in that cabin.

305
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:56,264
He had what he wanted.
He could have just run.

306
00:12:56,265 --> 00:12:58,678
There's gotta be something
else keeping him in lockport.

307
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,558
I couldn't stop him from choking bunting.

308
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:02,798
Emily, don't do that.

309
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:04,844
He was right there.

310
00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:11,930
Schrader's face is all over the news.

311
00:13:11,931 --> 00:13:13,437
He's been on the run for almost 2 hours

312
00:13:13,438 --> 00:13:14,782
And we're no closer to catching him.

313
00:13:14,783 --> 00:13:16,089
We need to find the partner.

314
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:17,029
Hey.

315
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,436
Prentiss: Hey. How are you?

316
00:13:18,437 --> 00:13:20,622
I feel like I got hit by a truck.

317
00:13:20,623 --> 00:13:22,330
Here, sit. Thanks.

318
00:13:22,331 --> 00:13:24,615
Uh, garcia, tell everyone
what you just told me.

319
00:13:24,616 --> 00:13:26,629
I have unearthed more of schrader's past.

320
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:29,315
Now, what we do know is
that he robbed 15 banks

321
00:13:29,316 --> 00:13:30,955
In the state of new york in the nineties.

322
00:13:30,956 --> 00:13:33,908
However, what your resident glamou
r-puss smarty-pants just found out

323
00:13:33,909 --> 00:13:35,688
Was that most of that
money was never recovered.

324
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:37,678
Reid: Where is it?

325
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:39,624
My best guess-- only he knows.

326
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,070
Rossi: Good reason to stick around lockport.

327
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:43,217
Jj: The last robbery,
the one that put him away,

328
00:13:43,218 --> 00:13:44,964
Should have been routine,
right? So what happened?

329
00:13:44,965 --> 00:13:46,571
Morgan: Maybe someone turned him in.

330
00:13:46,572 --> 00:13:48,284
Garcia: He kept to himself,
always worked alone.

331
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:49,257
Who'd turn him in?

332
00:13:49,258 --> 00:13:50,264
We're missing somebody.

333
00:13:50,265 --> 00:13:51,977
Garcia.

334
00:13:51,978 --> 00:13:53,723
Yes, checking, sir.

335
00:13:53,724 --> 00:13:55,330
What's this all about?

336
00:13:55,331 --> 00:13:57,650
Nothing to do till morning.

337
00:13:58,757 --> 00:14:01,476
[chuckling]

338
00:14:02,477 --> 00:14:04,016
What's your problem?

339
00:14:05,964 --> 00:14:08,815
Hesitation puts obstacles in the path.

340
00:14:08,816 --> 00:14:10,395
Boldness eliminates them.

341
00:14:10,396 --> 00:14:12,542
Boldness strikes fear.

342
00:14:12,543 --> 00:14:15,428
Fear creates authority.

343
00:14:15,429 --> 00:14:18,714
"the 48 laws of power." you know it?

344
00:14:20,801 --> 00:14:23,013
You want to shoot me?

345
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:28,819
Have I said thanks yet?

346
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,872
Ok. Records leading up to schrader's arrest

347
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:35,491
Show this other bank robber

348
00:14:35,492 --> 00:14:37,238
Named dan otey.

349
00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:38,945
And he was looking at
copious amounts of time,

350
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:41,464
Then he strikes a deal and all
of a sudden schrader is arrested.

351
00:14:41,465 --> 00:14:43,043
It can't be a coincidence.

352
00:14:43,044 --> 00:14:44,650
You know, it's not uncommon
for criminals to buy jobs

353
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:46,397
Off one another.
Maybe that's what schrader did,

354
00:14:46,398 --> 00:14:48,543
But dan otey sold him out
for a lesser sentence.

355
00:14:48,544 --> 00:14:49,683
It doesn't make sense.

356
00:14:49,684 --> 00:14:51,463
Otey was a rat and now he's the partner?

357
00:14:51,464 --> 00:14:52,676
Yeah, you're right.

358
00:14:52,677 --> 00:14:53,682
Schrader wouldn't trust him.

359
00:14:53,683 --> 00:14:55,089
If anything, he'd want him dead.

360
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:56,396
Probably, but he'd use him first.

361
00:14:56,397 --> 00:14:57,809
He'd tell otey that he owes him one

362
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:00,155
And that he might save his life if
he helps him get out of this jam.

363
00:15:00,156 --> 00:15:01,501
Where's he now, garcia?

364
00:15:01,502 --> 00:15:03,041
Uh, dan otey is a local.

365
00:15:03,042 --> 00:15:05,088
He lives off of route 7.

366
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,459
Nobody's here. Let's go.

367
00:15:21,393 --> 00:15:22,466
Is your daddy home?

368
00:15:22,467 --> 00:15:23,947
Who are you?

369
00:15:23,948 --> 00:15:25,722
Man: Close the door!

370
00:15:25,723 --> 00:15:27,169
Don't do this.

371
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:30,997
Calm down. I'm just gonna
scare him a little bit.

372
00:15:30,998 --> 00:15:33,787
Hey, dan!

373
00:15:36,474 --> 00:15:39,053
[screaming]

374
00:15:39,054 --> 00:15:41,974
You sent your son to the door?

375
00:15:42,749 --> 00:15:44,995
[gunshot] coward?

376
00:15:49,893 --> 00:15:51,861
His wife and son were home.

377
00:15:51,862 --> 00:15:53,496
Are they ok?

378
00:15:53,497 --> 00:15:54,831
The partner took them upstairs

379
00:15:54,832 --> 00:15:56,132
While schrader destroyed the place.

380
00:15:56,133 --> 00:15:58,568
Emily is with the wife right now.

381
00:15:58,569 --> 00:16:00,137
[crying]

382
00:16:00,138 --> 00:16:03,307
Dan had turned everything around.

383
00:16:03,308 --> 00:16:06,709
He was clean, life was finally good.

384
00:16:08,979 --> 00:16:13,216
But I was always afraid
to believe it, you know?

385
00:16:13,217 --> 00:16:15,885
Because then he could be taken away.

386
00:16:17,788 --> 00:16:20,089
I'm so sorry.

387
00:16:21,992 --> 00:16:25,928
The other man-- what did he look like?

388
00:16:28,265 --> 00:16:29,766
Uh, white...

389
00:16:29,767 --> 00:16:32,202
Mid-40s...

390
00:16:32,203 --> 00:16:34,104
Short hair...

391
00:16:34,105 --> 00:16:35,505
I don't know.

392
00:16:35,506 --> 00:16:37,741
Had you ever seen him before?

393
00:16:37,742 --> 00:16:40,043
Dale, yeah. The other guy, no.

394
00:16:40,044 --> 00:16:44,114
We're trying to figure out how
schrader knows his partner.

395
00:16:44,115 --> 00:16:46,248
I have no idea.

396
00:16:46,249 --> 00:16:49,016
How did they talk to each other?

397
00:16:49,017 --> 00:16:50,384
They didn't.

398
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:51,785
Dale trashed the place,

399
00:16:51,786 --> 00:16:53,618
And the other guy took us upstairs.

400
00:16:53,619 --> 00:16:56,218
He kept pushing me and...Jason.

401
00:16:56,219 --> 00:16:58,251
I didn't know what was gonna happen.

402
00:16:58,252 --> 00:17:00,453
Did he hurt you?

403
00:17:00,454 --> 00:17:03,054
He just scared us.
He locked us in the back room.

404
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:05,255
He locked you in the room and that's it?

405
00:17:05,256 --> 00:17:06,789
Yeah.

406
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,658
He told us to shut up and keep it locked.

407
00:17:09,659 --> 00:17:13,260
But jason wouldn't stop crying.

408
00:17:14,763 --> 00:17:16,497
This wasn't the deal.

409
00:17:16,498 --> 00:17:17,798
Really?

410
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:19,966
I didn't sign up to kill anybody.

411
00:17:19,967 --> 00:17:21,600
You saved my ass.

412
00:17:21,601 --> 00:17:23,168
You pulled me out of that car, remember?

413
00:17:23,169 --> 00:17:24,736
Then people died.

414
00:17:24,737 --> 00:17:26,004
I can't do it. I won't.

415
00:17:26,005 --> 00:17:27,438
Yes, you will.

416
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,307
You terrorized that family.
You killed their father.

417
00:17:30,308 --> 00:17:32,576
Don't worry. The kid is young.

418
00:17:32,577 --> 00:17:34,244
He won't remember him.

419
00:17:34,245 --> 00:17:37,080
I also killed that cop.
Don't forget about him.

420
00:17:37,081 --> 00:17:38,248
You enjoyed it.

421
00:17:38,249 --> 00:17:41,618
Yes, I did. And you didn't stop me.

422
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,520
Uhh!

423
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:47,323
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!

424
00:17:49,926 --> 00:17:52,962
Ha ha ha ha ha!

425
00:17:54,631 --> 00:17:56,432
Ooh...I get it.

426
00:17:56,433 --> 00:17:59,435
Ohh...You gotta do what you gotta do.

427
00:17:59,436 --> 00:18:01,003
And I want what I want.

428
00:18:01,004 --> 00:18:02,971
Come on, bro.

429
00:18:02,972 --> 00:18:04,973
Almost done.

430
00:18:04,974 --> 00:18:06,408
[chuckles]

431
00:18:12,982 --> 00:18:14,616
Schrader gets off on power.

432
00:18:14,617 --> 00:18:16,685
That and money are what motivate him.

433
00:18:16,686 --> 00:18:17,820
And revenge.

434
00:18:17,821 --> 00:18:19,955
11 years away, he comes out a murderer.

435
00:18:19,956 --> 00:18:22,058
Who needs a partner,
somebody as bold as him.

436
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,458
Reid: And where'd they meet?

437
00:18:23,459 --> 00:18:25,893
Schrader was away and patient.

438
00:18:25,894 --> 00:18:28,128
The minute he got out,
he hooked up with his partner first,

439
00:18:28,129 --> 00:18:29,462
And then he killed stacy ryan

440
00:18:29,463 --> 00:18:30,763
On his way to kidnap his daughter.

441
00:18:30,764 --> 00:18:33,798
What's missing from his day?

442
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:34,798
The money.

443
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,230
He took his daughter but left the money.

444
00:18:36,231 --> 00:18:37,598
That doesn't make any sense.

445
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:40,167
Did he have another plan on how
to support himself in canada?

446
00:18:40,168 --> 00:18:41,600
He's only known a life of crime.

447
00:18:41,601 --> 00:18:44,769
He's incapable of change.
Time away proved that.

448
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:48,104
Well, otey's wife said that
the partner locked them away,

449
00:18:48,105 --> 00:18:49,805
Like he didn't want them to get hurt.

450
00:18:49,806 --> 00:18:51,973
He was protective. That's weird, right?

451
00:18:51,974 --> 00:18:54,175
They're both dominant personalities,

452
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:56,877
But they sound like they
played good cop/bad cop.

453
00:18:56,878 --> 00:18:59,312
Well, it's been 4 hours since the accident.

454
00:18:59,313 --> 00:19:01,414
You still think I'm in shock?

455
00:19:01,415 --> 00:19:03,716
There's one way to find out.

456
00:19:05,718 --> 00:19:08,586
Ok. First thing,

457
00:19:08,587 --> 00:19:11,055
We go to the station, gonna get the key.

458
00:19:11,056 --> 00:19:14,190
Then we go to the bank, which opens at 9:00.

459
00:19:14,191 --> 00:19:15,158
Then we're done.

460
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:16,794
It's not that easy. I told you.

461
00:19:16,795 --> 00:19:18,095
Not for me.

462
00:19:18,096 --> 00:19:20,331
But you-- everybody loves you.

463
00:19:20,332 --> 00:19:22,601
Ok, I do this. Then what?

464
00:19:22,602 --> 00:19:23,803
Then it's over.

465
00:19:23,804 --> 00:19:24,970
No.

466
00:19:24,971 --> 00:19:26,105
No?

467
00:19:26,106 --> 00:19:27,840
No. There's no version of me surviving this.

468
00:19:27,841 --> 00:19:30,109
You get what you want, I'm dead.

469
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:33,746
Well, if you believe that, do it.

470
00:19:34,881 --> 00:19:38,217
Go ahead. You can stop this right now.

471
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:41,419
You want me dead. How bad?

472
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:44,054
Come on. Kill me.

473
00:19:44,055 --> 00:19:45,788
What?

474
00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:48,055
You need my help? Is that what you need?

475
00:19:49,123 --> 00:19:51,290
You know I'm not gonna stop this

476
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,391
Until I get what I want.

477
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:54,826
I'm not gonna stop it, but you can.

478
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:58,262
You want to end it? Then do it. End it.

479
00:19:58,263 --> 00:19:59,696
Come on. Do it.

480
00:19:59,697 --> 00:20:02,331
Take a chance that this all
works out for you. Come on!

481
00:20:02,332 --> 00:20:03,732
Come on! Do it!

482
00:20:03,733 --> 00:20:04,967
Come on! Come on!

483
00:20:04,968 --> 00:20:07,969
End it! Do it! Come on! Do it!

484
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,141
That's what I thought.

485
00:20:15,142 --> 00:20:18,644
It's not in you, joey. Never was.

486
00:20:23,382 --> 00:20:25,015
All right, take a deep breath, prentiss.

487
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:26,348
Let's just do this.

488
00:20:26,349 --> 00:20:27,648
All right.

489
00:20:27,649 --> 00:20:29,381
Tell me what you saw. Was it dark?

490
00:20:29,382 --> 00:20:31,783
Yeah. You were there. You know it was.

491
00:20:31,784 --> 00:20:32,784
Come on, now.

492
00:20:32,785 --> 00:20:34,518
Ok.

493
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:37,487
What did it smell like inside the car?

494
00:20:37,488 --> 00:20:38,520
Sweat.

495
00:20:38,521 --> 00:20:40,522
So you were hot?

496
00:20:40,523 --> 00:20:43,557
Yeah. I--I opened the window a little bit.

497
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:44,992
It's really quiet.

498
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,727
Are there any other cars on the road?

499
00:20:46,728 --> 00:20:48,229
There's one coming.

500
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:50,265
What color is it?

501
00:20:50,266 --> 00:20:52,402
I...It's too bright.

502
00:20:52,403 --> 00:20:53,971
Ok, but you looked at it. You saw it.

503
00:20:53,972 --> 00:20:56,174
It's a 4-door hybrid, black.

504
00:20:56,175 --> 00:20:57,310
Where was schrader?

505
00:20:57,311 --> 00:20:59,279
He's looking out the window.

506
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,282
Was he waiting for something?

507
00:21:01,283 --> 00:21:03,586
Here comes another car.

508
00:21:03,587 --> 00:21:06,155
A car or the truck? It's the truck.

509
00:21:06,156 --> 00:21:07,990
Schrader sees it.

510
00:21:07,991 --> 00:21:11,126
That's when it happens.
He's...Out of his seatbelt.

511
00:21:11,127 --> 00:21:12,994
He's hunched over.

512
00:21:12,995 --> 00:21:15,729
And he gets his cuffs out in front of him.

513
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,064
Ok, then what?

514
00:21:17,065 --> 00:21:18,632
Uh, bunting pulled over,

515
00:21:18,633 --> 00:21:21,568
And--and schrader put his seatbelt back on.

516
00:21:21,569 --> 00:21:22,969
He knew it was coming.

517
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:24,403
Where did the truck come from?

518
00:21:24,404 --> 00:21:26,739
Uh, behind us. Uh, no--

519
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,674
Uh...It was in front of us.

520
00:21:29,675 --> 00:21:31,643
Who was driving, prentiss?

521
00:21:31,644 --> 00:21:33,277
I don't know. I can't see.

522
00:21:33,278 --> 00:21:34,846
Ok. It's all right, it's all right.

523
00:21:34,847 --> 00:21:36,780
You're sure it was the truck?

524
00:21:36,781 --> 00:21:38,115
Yeah. It's a big truck.

525
00:21:38,116 --> 00:21:41,117
Think. Who was driving?

526
00:21:41,118 --> 00:21:42,518
Who was driving?

527
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:44,954
A white male, 40s.

528
00:21:44,955 --> 00:21:46,855
All right, now your car stops rolling.

529
00:21:46,856 --> 00:21:49,657
Yeah. Um...

530
00:21:49,658 --> 00:21:52,325
I'm pinned. My seatbelt is jammed.

531
00:21:52,326 --> 00:21:56,461
I can't breathe. I can't
see anything. I can hear--

532
00:21:56,462 --> 00:21:58,629
Oh, god, he's killing bunting.

533
00:21:58,630 --> 00:21:59,930
But the partner's not there yet?

534
00:21:59,931 --> 00:22:01,365
No. Where is he?

535
00:22:01,366 --> 00:22:02,933
He's running towards us.

536
00:22:02,934 --> 00:22:04,134
What's he wearing?

537
00:22:04,135 --> 00:22:05,968
Jeans. Boots.

538
00:22:05,969 --> 00:22:07,769
What's wrong with you? You killed a cop?

539
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:09,070
He's freaked out that bunting's dead.

540
00:22:09,071 --> 00:22:10,404
Why would he care?

541
00:22:10,405 --> 00:22:12,505
I don't know. But he won't let him kill me.

542
00:22:12,506 --> 00:22:13,606
Give me the gun.

543
00:22:13,607 --> 00:22:14,573
She's a fed.

544
00:22:14,574 --> 00:22:16,041
She knows that there's two of us now.

545
00:22:16,042 --> 00:22:18,075
And he keeps telling him to...

546
00:22:18,076 --> 00:22:19,943
Put pressure on it. On the bleeding.

547
00:22:19,944 --> 00:22:21,811
Ok. It's gonna be ok.

548
00:22:21,812 --> 00:22:23,946
Wait. He was talking to me.

549
00:22:23,947 --> 00:22:26,649
There's a lot of blood. Put pressure on it.

550
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,884
You're gonna be all right. Understand?

551
00:22:28,885 --> 00:22:31,554
He knew we were on that road.

552
00:22:31,555 --> 00:22:32,956
He was upset that bunting was dead.

553
00:22:32,957 --> 00:22:34,459
He wouldn't let schrader kill me.

554
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,427
He kept telling me to put pressure on it.

555
00:22:36,428 --> 00:22:39,764
And he was calm, like he's done this before.

556
00:22:39,765 --> 00:22:41,633
He was helping me.

557
00:22:41,634 --> 00:22:43,669
He took dan otey's family upstairs,

558
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:44,670
Protected them from schrader.

559
00:22:44,671 --> 00:22:47,139
Do we really think a good guy hooked up

560
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,674
With a criminal like dale schrader?

561
00:22:54,346 --> 00:22:56,714
Voicemail: You have one saved message.

562
00:22:56,715 --> 00:22:58,582
[beep]

563
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:02,284
Joe, honey, it's me.

564
00:23:02,285 --> 00:23:04,619
He got us. All of us.

565
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,321
I don't know where we are.

566
00:23:06,322 --> 00:23:08,322
God, I am so sorry.

567
00:23:08,323 --> 00:23:09,757
Boy: Help us, daddy!

568
00:23:09,758 --> 00:23:11,258
Woman: Just do what he says, ok?

569
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:15,629
Please just do whatever he says.

570
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:16,656
[beep]

571
00:23:16,657 --> 00:23:17,784
[beep]

572
00:23:17,785 --> 00:23:18,818
Joe, honey, it's me.

573
00:23:18,819 --> 00:23:20,553
He got us.

574
00:23:22,288 --> 00:23:24,089
You've almost got it.

575
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:26,657
You're doing so good.

576
00:23:26,658 --> 00:23:29,458
[door opens and slams]

577
00:23:29,459 --> 00:23:31,393
I'm sorry. Please.

578
00:23:34,462 --> 00:23:36,296
Ohh!

579
00:23:36,297 --> 00:23:37,697
Oh, my god.

580
00:23:37,698 --> 00:23:40,733
My god, please stop!

581
00:23:40,734 --> 00:23:42,501
Don't you touch him!

582
00:23:42,502 --> 00:23:44,604
It's not his fault. I told him to do it.

583
00:23:44,605 --> 00:23:45,906
No, wait! What are you doing?

584
00:23:45,907 --> 00:23:46,907
Mom! Mommy!

585
00:23:46,908 --> 00:23:48,608
No! Don't take my kid!

586
00:23:48,609 --> 00:23:50,777
Mom! Mommy! Mom, help!

587
00:23:50,778 --> 00:23:52,812
Stop!

588
00:23:52,813 --> 00:23:53,813
Mom!

589
00:23:53,814 --> 00:23:55,314
No...

590
00:23:55,315 --> 00:23:57,617
[sobbing] mom!

591
00:24:01,867 --> 00:24:03,533
So how did schrader get this guy to sign on?

592
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:06,401
Good people do bad things.

593
00:24:06,402 --> 00:24:08,369
I'm just saying, it happens.

594
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:12,005
Right. But this partner wouldn't let me die.

595
00:24:12,006 --> 00:24:13,373
He protected otey's family.

596
00:24:13,374 --> 00:24:16,775
In the same day, he helped a
convicted felon escape custody.

597
00:24:16,776 --> 00:24:18,276
His loyalties are all over the place.

598
00:24:18,277 --> 00:24:20,044
The guy sounds desperate.

599
00:24:20,045 --> 00:24:22,747
Maybe he needs some money. I mean,
schrader's got a lot of it still out there.

600
00:24:22,748 --> 00:24:24,248
He could have promised him a cut.

601
00:24:24,249 --> 00:24:25,916
Ah, I don't know. He's an accomplice

602
00:24:25,917 --> 00:24:27,451
To 3 murders and a kidnapping.

603
00:24:27,452 --> 00:24:29,085
Is there enough money out there

604
00:24:29,086 --> 00:24:30,853
For you to sign on to something like that?

605
00:24:30,854 --> 00:24:33,254
So it's something bigger than the money.

606
00:24:33,255 --> 00:24:35,090
Um, maybe schrader's threatening him.

607
00:24:35,091 --> 00:24:36,292
Leverage?

608
00:24:36,293 --> 00:24:38,227
It would have to be big.

609
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:41,063
We caught schrader because
he kidnapped his daughter.

610
00:24:41,064 --> 00:24:43,031
He was emotional and his guard was down.

611
00:24:43,032 --> 00:24:46,100
Clearly, family means more
to him than we thought.

612
00:24:46,101 --> 00:24:49,003
Schrader's ex-wife forced him
to give up custody of jenny.

613
00:24:49,004 --> 00:24:52,906
Maybe he wants this guy to know what
it feels like to lose his family, too.

614
00:24:52,907 --> 00:24:54,541
It sounds like revenge to me.

615
00:24:54,542 --> 00:24:55,742
Maybe it is.

616
00:24:57,211 --> 00:24:59,111
You know what I just don't get?

617
00:24:59,112 --> 00:25:01,946
Why people think you're a hero.

618
00:25:01,947 --> 00:25:03,381
I know something they don't.

619
00:25:03,382 --> 00:25:06,352
You want to be just like me.

620
00:25:06,353 --> 00:25:08,420
Honest men bore you.

621
00:25:08,421 --> 00:25:09,954
They're too predictable.

622
00:25:09,955 --> 00:25:12,322
And you'd rather die than be ordinary,

623
00:25:12,323 --> 00:25:15,526
So you take risks and you push the limits.

624
00:25:15,527 --> 00:25:17,693
But you were raised to be a good guy.

625
00:25:17,694 --> 00:25:20,495
It's in your blood. You can't help it.

626
00:25:20,496 --> 00:25:24,599
But that kills you a little bit.

627
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,634
That's why you had to figure out a way

628
00:25:26,635 --> 00:25:27,902
For a good guy to be bad,

629
00:25:27,903 --> 00:25:29,437
And that's how you got into my world.

630
00:25:29,438 --> 00:25:30,437
Am I close?

631
00:25:30,438 --> 00:25:31,471
I want to talk to them.

632
00:25:31,472 --> 00:25:34,507
You got your message and that picture.

633
00:25:34,508 --> 00:25:37,376
How do I know you haven't
killed them already?

634
00:25:37,377 --> 00:25:38,744
You have to trust me.

635
00:25:40,847 --> 00:25:43,081
Whew.

636
00:25:43,082 --> 00:25:44,816
Well, I'm disappointed.

637
00:25:44,817 --> 00:25:47,718
But your wife and your kids
are gonna be devastated

638
00:25:47,719 --> 00:25:49,286
'cause they didn't have to die.

639
00:25:49,287 --> 00:25:51,721
Look, you're gonna kill me.
There's no point in hurting them.

640
00:25:51,722 --> 00:25:54,390
What kind of father are you?

641
00:25:54,391 --> 00:25:55,691
We've been over this.

642
00:25:55,692 --> 00:25:57,792
I'm the only one who knows where they are.

643
00:25:57,793 --> 00:26:01,695
As long as I'm alive, they're safe.

644
00:26:01,696 --> 00:26:05,899
If you stop helping me,
they're dead. How's that?

645
00:26:20,077 --> 00:26:21,944
Anything on schrader's case?

646
00:26:21,945 --> 00:26:24,547
The usual suspects-- judge, lawyers.

647
00:26:24,548 --> 00:26:26,181
They're all accounted for this morning.

648
00:26:26,182 --> 00:26:28,217
If it's revenge, then it's gotta
be someone who put him away.

649
00:26:28,218 --> 00:26:30,152
Well, it's not the officers who arrested him

650
00:26:30,153 --> 00:26:32,220
Or the judge who sentenced him.

651
00:26:32,221 --> 00:26:33,521
Then who is it?

652
00:26:33,522 --> 00:26:36,190
Garcia, I need the names of
every law enforcement agent

653
00:26:36,191 --> 00:26:37,624
Involved in the schrader case.

654
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:39,192
You know everybody.

655
00:26:39,193 --> 00:26:42,094
Yeah, but I want every single employee
the year that he was arrested.

656
00:26:42,095 --> 00:26:43,329
Ok, give me a minute.

657
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:45,397
Morgan: A whole minute? Come on,
baby girl, what,

658
00:26:45,398 --> 00:26:46,932
Are you losing your touch?

659
00:26:46,933 --> 00:26:48,600
Oh, watch your pretty mouth.

660
00:26:48,601 --> 00:26:51,136
Personnel records come at you now.

661
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,239
Who's still active?

662
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,206
Reid: Most.

663
00:26:56,207 --> 00:26:58,007
Would he risk using an active officer?

664
00:26:58,008 --> 00:27:00,075
Depends on how much he hates them.

665
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:01,410
Has anyone retired?

666
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,678
Yeah, two of them. Let's see-
-matt massey, jeff messick.

667
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,213
Both married with kids, white, in their 50s.

668
00:27:05,214 --> 00:27:08,215
Prentiss: Wait, can I see those pictures?

669
00:27:08,216 --> 00:27:10,050
No.

670
00:27:10,051 --> 00:27:11,251
No.

671
00:27:11,252 --> 00:27:13,753
Ohh. Why wouldn't he go
after one of the officers

672
00:27:13,754 --> 00:27:15,021
Who arrested him?

673
00:27:15,022 --> 00:27:16,922
It makes the most sense for revenge.

674
00:27:16,923 --> 00:27:18,490
Hey, wait a minute, guys. Listen to this.

675
00:27:18,491 --> 00:27:21,092
There was a witness who never
testified on schrader's behalf.

676
00:27:21,093 --> 00:27:23,127
Schrader could see that as a betrayal.

677
00:27:23,128 --> 00:27:26,197
He gets out of prison and
uses him to get what he wants.

678
00:27:26,198 --> 00:27:29,665
Garcia, I want you to run a history
on a witness from the schrader case,

679
00:27:29,666 --> 00:27:30,732
Joey short.

680
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:32,066
Joey short.

681
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,367
Was born in '66 in nyc.

682
00:27:34,368 --> 00:27:36,635
Didn't hold a lot of jobs
except for construction.

683
00:27:36,636 --> 00:27:38,003
In and out of rehab.

684
00:27:38,004 --> 00:27:39,204
Morgan: Where is he now?

685
00:27:39,205 --> 00:27:41,406
His last known address was 10 years ago.

686
00:27:41,407 --> 00:27:42,507
Did he do time?

687
00:27:42,508 --> 00:27:44,042
Mm-mmm. No.

688
00:27:44,043 --> 00:27:45,376
Come on, garcia.
People don't just disappear.

689
00:27:45,377 --> 00:27:48,012
This guy's got a history
with a lot of holes in it.

690
00:27:48,013 --> 00:27:49,146
He went to rehab.

691
00:27:49,147 --> 00:27:50,981
You know, maybe this guy
had to walk the walk.

692
00:27:50,982 --> 00:27:52,249
He was undercover.

693
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,750
That makes sense.

694
00:27:53,751 --> 00:27:55,418
Those guys are up for anything,

695
00:27:55,419 --> 00:27:58,186
And they take big risks,
professionally and personally.

696
00:27:58,187 --> 00:28:00,622
It explains his behavior, too.
Good guy doing bad things.

697
00:28:00,623 --> 00:28:02,825
Garcia, can you get us
joey short's real name?

698
00:28:02,826 --> 00:28:04,060
It's not here.

699
00:28:04,061 --> 00:28:06,129
Well, if schrader can find it, so can we.

700
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:07,631
The guy needed to be schrader's friend,

701
00:28:07,632 --> 00:28:09,099
So they're probably around the same age.

702
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,434
Look for academy graduates
in the early nineties.

703
00:28:11,435 --> 00:28:12,502
Ok.

704
00:28:12,503 --> 00:28:14,537
Did any of them not go into police work?

705
00:28:14,538 --> 00:28:16,438
Baby, I don't follow you.

706
00:28:16,439 --> 00:28:18,773
If he went undercover,
then anything tied to the academy

707
00:28:18,774 --> 00:28:20,808
Would have to be severed.
I mean, the guy graduated,

708
00:28:20,809 --> 00:28:23,878
Be he had to immediately start
working his history as joey short.

709
00:28:23,879 --> 00:28:25,346
He went into construction,

710
00:28:25,347 --> 00:28:27,214
Made his contacts in the bank robbery world,

711
00:28:27,215 --> 00:28:28,448
And then he met schrader,

712
00:28:28,449 --> 00:28:29,516
Earned schrader's trust,

713
00:28:29,517 --> 00:28:32,652
And then turned him in
and got out of the game.

714
00:28:32,653 --> 00:28:34,553
Ok. Here's a couple of guys
look like they dropped out.

715
00:28:34,554 --> 00:28:35,788

He has a wife and 2 kids.

Let me look at you.

728
00:28:59,742 --> 00:29:01,242
How's life?

729
00:29:01,243 --> 00:29:02,210
It's a ride.

730
00:29:02,211 --> 00:29:03,677
Molly, the kids? Good. They're good.

731
00:29:03,678 --> 00:29:04,978
What are you doing here?

732
00:29:04,979 --> 00:29:07,714
Just, uh, you know, working on an old case.

733
00:29:07,715 --> 00:29:09,182
Uh, they stopped paying you, didn't they?

734
00:29:09,183 --> 00:29:10,683
Yes, ma'am.

735
00:29:10,684 --> 00:29:12,384
Don't you ma'am me. What do you need?

736
00:29:12,385 --> 00:29:13,685
Just, uh, 5 minutes?

737
00:29:13,686 --> 00:29:14,753
You got it.

Ok, thanks.

Muller's not at home. No one is.

742
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:23,493
His wife didn't show up at work,

743
00:29:23,494 --> 00:29:25,361
The kids weren't at
school yesterday or today.

744
00:29:25,362 --> 00:29:26,729
Schrader probably has them hostage.

Morgan: Yeah, but where?

746
00:29:27,797 --> 00:29:30,165
What could joe muller do for him?

00:29:30,166 --> 00:29:32,133

He can get him the money.

no one even knows where it is.

Reid: Someplace safe.

752
00:29:37,205 --> 00:29:40,306
Jj: Would he be bold enough
to hide it a safe deposit box?

753
00:29:40,307 --> 00:29:41,874
Reid: A thief using a bank? Yeah, maybe.

754
00:29:41,875 --> 00:29:43,642
Jj: Schrader can't walk into a bank.

00:29:43,643 --> 00:29:44,877
His face is everywhere.

756
00:29:44,878 --> 00:29:47,113
No one would think twice
if muller walked in.

757
00:29:47,114 --> 00:29:49,014
Reid: He'd have to have a key.

758

Prentiss: Where's the physical
evidence from the schrader case?

We don't have it.

760
00:29:56,721 --> 00:29:59,422
Well, if we can figure out
where schrader hid the money,

761
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:01,157
We'll know where he's going.

The only person who knew where my family was

806
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:38,196
And now he's dead.

807
00:31:38,197 --> 00:31:39,798
I had every chance to kill him.

808
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:42,567
But I couldn't. Because he had my family.

809
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:44,468

810
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:47,270

Just do what he says, ok?

00:32:02,484 --> 00:32:03,751
Please just do whatever he says.

00:32:06,521 --> 00:32:07,888
She might be able to help.

822
00:32:07,889 --> 00:32:09,857
There was only one phone call?

823
00:32:09,858 --> 00:32:11,992
I tried to get him to let me talk
to them again, but he wouldn't.

824
00:32:11,993 --> 00:32:14,462
There must not be anyone
there watching them.

825
00:32:14,463 --> 00:32:17,899
So he hid a family where no
one hears them call for help.

826
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,000
Someplace remote. That cabin?

827
00:32:19,001 --> 00:32:20,401
No. The locals tore it apart.

828
00:32:20,402 --> 00:32:21,502
There's no one there.

829
00:32:21,503 --> 00:32:23,237
Where are they?

00:32:23,238 --> 00:32:24,704
You saw schrader since he's had your family.

You saw something or heard it.

832
00:32:26,774 --> 00:32:27,973
There's got to be some clue.

00:32:27,974 --> 00:32:30,274
Prentiss: When was the last
time you saw your family?

834

Hold on, joe, I've got to get my phone.

00:32:37,946 --> 00:32:38,913
Ok.

840
00:32:38,914 --> 00:32:42,049
See you later, mrs. Muller.

What was her route?

849
00:33:01,532 --> 00:33:03,699
Uh, north on route 7, east on 22.

850
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,901
Is that route isolated
during the morning commute?

851
00:33:05,902 --> 00:33:07,569
No.

852
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:10,338
If he was watching, there's a good
chance she never left the driveway.

853
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,908

He'd been trying to figure
out how he got locked up.

862
00:33:46,973 --> 00:33:49,340
He knew otey had ratted
him out for the robbery,

863
00:33:49,341 --> 00:33:51,244
But that wasn't enough to put him away.

864
00:33:51,245 --> 00:33:53,655
He said I was the piece that didn't fit.

865
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:55,556
He figured out I was a cop.

866
00:33:55,557 --> 00:33:56,590
And he took your family.

867
00:33:56,591 --> 00:33:58,692

868
00:33:58,693 --> 00:34:00,627
Yeah. I think she's some junkie.

00:35:25,032 --> 00:35:26,165
Prentiss: Why didn't he?

897
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:29,201
He didn't want to draw
attention to that place.

898
00:35:29,202 --> 00:35:30,402
Where was it?

899
00:35:30,403 --> 00:35:31,770
Uh, south of van wyck.

900
00:35:31,771 --> 00:35:32,804
Bad area?

901
00:35:32,805 --> 00:35:33,905
Abandoned. Junkies took over.

902
00:35:33,906 --> 00:35:35,540
Perfect place to leave hostages.

903
00:35:35,541 --> 00:35:37,208
Prentiss: Can you take us back there?

904
00:35:37,209 --> 00:35:39,376
Wait. You think she knew about my family.

905
00:35:39,377 --> 00:35:41,011
Her murder was the only
thing that didn't fit,

906
00:35:41,012 --> 00:35:44,781
And now it makes sense.
Schrader killed her to shut her up.

907
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:50,719
Morgan: Rossi.

908
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,721
Turn around. Turn around!

909
00:35:52,722 --> 00:35:54,322
Fbi. Where are they?

910
00:35:54,323 --> 00:35:55,890
Give me the stuff, I'll tell you.

911
00:35:55,891 --> 00:35:57,558
Where are the kids?

912
00:35:57,559 --> 00:35:58,826
What kids?

913
00:35:58,827 --> 00:36:01,228
Get him out of here.
He don't know nothin' else.

914
00:36:06,932 --> 00:36:10,067
We're going up. Come on, rossi.

915
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:14,070
Clear!

916
00:36:16,739 --> 00:36:19,040
Clear. Clear.

917
00:36:32,927 --> 00:36:34,728
[door breaks open]

918
00:36:34,729 --> 00:36:36,197
Molly?

919
00:36:36,198 --> 00:36:37,732
Hey.

920
00:36:37,733 --> 00:36:38,900
The kids.

921
00:36:38,901 --> 00:36:40,535
I'm so sorry.

922
00:36:40,536 --> 00:36:41,936
Where are they?

923
00:36:41,937 --> 00:36:42,903
I don't know.

924
00:36:42,904 --> 00:36:43,970
Where are the kids?

925
00:36:43,971 --> 00:36:45,338
I don't know. Find them.

926
00:36:45,339 --> 00:36:47,005
All right. You're gonna be ok.

927
00:36:47,006 --> 00:36:49,341
I got you.

928
00:36:49,342 --> 00:36:52,044
Ok.

929
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,245
Ohh...

930
00:37:00,682 --> 00:37:01,948
Clear!

931
00:37:04,618 --> 00:37:06,986
Clear!

932
00:37:07,821 --> 00:37:08,821
Rossi.

933
00:37:08,822 --> 00:37:10,323
Hey.

934
00:37:10,324 --> 00:37:12,759
Hey, little man.

935
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,161
Hey, it's ok.

936
00:37:15,162 --> 00:37:18,097
It's ok.

937
00:37:18,098 --> 00:37:21,100
Go get muller.

938
00:37:21,101 --> 00:37:23,736
Your dad's looking for you.

939
00:37:23,737 --> 00:37:25,304
We're gonna get you out of here.

940
00:37:25,305 --> 00:37:26,672
It's gonna be ok, all right?

941
00:37:26,673 --> 00:37:28,507
We're getting your dad right now.

942
00:37:31,978 --> 00:37:34,212
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

943
00:37:35,214 --> 00:37:37,882
Are you ok?

944
00:37:37,883 --> 00:37:40,718
[bottle rattling]

945
00:37:46,326 --> 00:37:48,494
Oh, hey.

946
00:37:48,495 --> 00:37:51,697
Hey. Ok.

947
00:37:54,034 --> 00:37:55,968
Ok.

948
00:37:55,969 --> 00:37:57,870
How you doing? Can I pick you up?

949
00:37:57,871 --> 00:38:00,773
Ok. Ok.

950
00:38:25,734 --> 00:38:28,036
Come here, sweetheart.

951
00:38:28,037 --> 00:38:30,739
Oh, I got you.

952
00:38:39,182 --> 00:38:41,450
Prentiss: Washington irving said,

953
00:38:41,451 --> 00:38:43,352
"there is a sacredness in tears.

954
00:38:43,353 --> 00:38:46,355
"they are not the mark of weakness,
but of power.

955
00:38:46,356 --> 00:38:49,157
"they are messengers of overwhelming grief

956
00:38:49,158 --> 00:38:51,959
And of unspeakable love."

957
00:39:07,878 --> 00:39:10,313
You got a sec?

958
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:12,248
Come in.

959
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:15,452
I just wanted to say

960
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:18,856
That you exceeded all
expectations leading this team.

961
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:20,757
Mine and everyone else's.

962
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:21,992
So have you, hotch.

963
00:39:21,993 --> 00:39:24,661
You showed the skill and
confidence of a natural leader,

964
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:26,929
And...I thank you for it.

965
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:28,730
Of course.

966
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,267
I get why you're back.

967
00:39:32,268 --> 00:39:33,635
Do you?

968
00:39:33,636 --> 00:39:35,870
You were never going to sit
behind a desk. You know why?

969
00:39:35,871 --> 00:39:38,806
Because your son knows
that you get the bad guys.

970
00:39:38,807 --> 00:39:41,542
And if you're not out there trying to catch them,
what's he going to think?

971
00:39:41,543 --> 00:39:44,712
Well, tonight he's gonna think
I wasn't there at bedtime.

972
00:39:46,215 --> 00:39:48,949
You're his hero, hotch.

973
00:39:50,218 --> 00:39:54,922
I, uh, figured I'd save you a couple hours.

974
00:39:56,357 --> 00:39:58,392
You don't have to do that anymore.

975
00:39:58,393 --> 00:40:00,027
I know I don't.

976
00:40:00,028 --> 00:40:04,065
But I also know what it's like
to be raised by a single parent.

977
00:40:04,066 --> 00:40:06,534
Every minute counts.

978
00:40:06,535 --> 00:40:08,870
So if you need me to make
that a regular thing,

979
00:40:08,871 --> 00:40:11,673
I'd be more than happy to.

980
00:40:11,674 --> 00:40:13,074
I appreciate that.

981
00:40:13,075 --> 00:40:14,609
I really do.

982
00:40:18,513 --> 00:40:19,914
Good night.

983
00:40:19,915 --> 00:40:21,682
Good night.

984
