1
00:00:02,263 --> 00:00:03,753
<i>Once upon a time...</i>

2
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:10,068
<i>There was a lonely king.</i>

3
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:14,368
<i>He spent many days and many nights</i>

4
00:00:14,453 --> 00:00:16,188
<i>wandering, searching,</i>

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,132
<i>looking for that...</i>

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,543
<i>one special someone.</i>

7
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:22,341
Good night.

8
00:00:30,302 --> 00:00:31,554
Good night, Jody.

9
00:00:32,325 --> 00:00:34,339
Good night, Mrs. Clemons.

10
00:00:39,061 --> 00:00:40,417
That... one...

11
00:00:40,881 --> 00:00:42,368
perfect... woman...

12
00:00:42,965 --> 00:00:44,664
who would be his queen.

13
00:01:11,233 --> 00:01:12,238
Daddy!

14
00:01:18,735 --> 00:01:21,823
I was hoping you'd come tonight.
Can you tell me another story?

15
00:01:21,865 --> 00:01:22,890
Well...

16
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,083
If you lay back down there

17
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:27,627
and close your little eyes.

18
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:33,468
Close your eyes.

19
00:01:35,251 --> 00:01:37,256
And the lonely king
searched far and wide

20
00:01:37,298 --> 00:01:39,524
looking for this woman
who would be his queen.

21
00:01:39,929 --> 00:01:42,694
<i>He had almost given up
hope of ever finding her</i>

22
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:45,532
<i>when he came upon
this small tavern...</i>

23
00:01:47,262 --> 00:01:49,275
<i>With a simple country barmaid.</i>

24
00:01:50,105 --> 00:01:52,415
<i>Now, when she looked
at the lonely king,</i>

25
00:01:52,845 --> 00:01:54,722
<i>he felt as if
they had known each other</i>

26
00:01:54,764 --> 00:01:56,038
<i>for a thousand years.</i>

27
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,283
Do you need a refill?

28
00:01:57,552 --> 00:02:00,250
Tanya, I guess I'm going home alone.

29
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,122
Excuse me a second.

30
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:03,861
First of all, you're not alone.

31
00:02:03,903 --> 00:02:06,157
And secondly, you're *ot driving.

32
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:07,354
Keys.

33
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,250
Betty, sam needs a cab.

34
00:02:09,292 --> 00:02:10,378
Sure.

35
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:15,898
That's weird.

36
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,044
Did you see where that guy went?

37
00:02:24,249 --> 00:02:26,792
<i>So he waited until she was alone,</i>

38
00:02:27,768 --> 00:02:29,258
<i>watching from afar</i>

39
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,551
<i>because he was afraid
to speak to her.</i>

40
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,075
<i>And then one day...</i>

41
00:02:42,842 --> 00:02:44,634
<i>her carriage wouldn't start.</i>

42
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,136
<i>And the king thought...</i>

43
00:02:49,864 --> 00:02:51,117
<i>this is fate.</i>

44
00:02:56,447 --> 00:02:58,779
<i>And so he rode down to rescue her.</i>

45
00:02:58,941 --> 00:03:00,557
<i>And she said to him...</i>

46
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,118
Must be the rain.

47
00:03:02,303 --> 00:03:03,772
Pop the hood.

48
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:08,938
Thank you!

49
00:03:11,284 --> 00:03:13,693
Did he rescue her, daddy?
Was she the one?

50
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,674
Well, the king thought so.

51
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,129
Try it now!

52
00:03:20,436 --> 00:03:21,533
Yes...

53
00:03:22,187 --> 00:03:24,188
Hey, I appreciate your...

54
00:03:27,654 --> 00:03:28,701
Hello?

55
00:03:30,925 --> 00:03:31,957
Hello?

56
00:03:33,444 --> 00:03:34,672
You ok?

57
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:41,929
<i>So they rode off into
the night together.</i>

58
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,937
And they lived happily ever after?

59
00:03:45,245 --> 00:03:47,059
Well, no, sweet pea.

60
00:03:48,288 --> 00:03:49,534
She wasn't the one.

61
00:03:50,466 --> 00:03:51,601
But don't worry.

62
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,359
The king's never gonna stop looking.

63
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,538
What if he never finds a queen?

64
00:03:57,778 --> 00:03:59,155
Well, then he'll just...

65
00:03:59,742 --> 00:04:01,878
We'll just go to a better place.

66
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:09,396
Good night, princess.

67
00:04:21,407 --> 00:04:24,494
Her name was Tanya Hill.
She was 29, a bartender.

68
00:04:24,536 --> 00:04:26,837
Found 2 days ago in Edgewood,
New Mexico.

69
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:29,017
She's the fifth woman
in over 6 months

70
00:04:29,059 --> 00:04:32,194
to be found dead in a ditch
off the I-40 and I-25.

71
00:04:32,326 --> 00:04:35,556
All were manually strangled.
None were sexually assaulted.

72
00:04:35,748 --> 00:04:38,386
Well, maybe the act
of strangulation is what gets him off.

73
00:04:38,428 --> 00:04:40,813
- Where were they abducted from?
- All over.

74
00:04:40,855 --> 00:04:42,744
Well, they're not just
crossing state lines.

75
00:04:42,786 --> 00:04:44,535
These cities are
hundreds of miles apart.

76
00:04:44,577 --> 00:04:47,525
That's a lot of bodies.
Why is it taking so long to be invited?

77
00:04:47,567 --> 00:04:50,463
We haven't been invited.
We found this on hsk database.

78
00:04:50,505 --> 00:04:52,796
Well, a lot of police departments
won't want this problem.

79
00:04:52,838 --> 00:04:55,492
The geographic profile shows
that only one of them has it.

80
00:04:55,534 --> 00:04:57,828
- They just don't know it yet.
- How do you know that?

81
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,329
Because he has a comfort zone

82
00:04:59,371 --> 00:05:01,984
based on the direction he was
heading when he dumped the bodies.

83
00:05:02,026 --> 00:05:04,279
All 5 cases point to our unsub

84
00:05:04,321 --> 00:05:07,011
heading to Edgewood, New Mexico.

85
00:05:07,053 --> 00:05:08,567
Now so are we.

86
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,007
- You got a ride.
- Hi!

87
00:05:38,142 --> 00:05:39,347
Oh. Excuse me.

88
00:05:39,721 --> 00:05:41,674
- I think you forgot these.
- Hee hee!

89
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,395
You are so cute.

90
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:44,849
Bye!

91
00:05:45,237 --> 00:05:46,180
Goodbye.

92
00:05:47,183 --> 00:05:49,015
Do you know anyone
that's heading west?

93
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,382
Sorry.

94
00:05:51,424 --> 00:05:52,435
I am.

95
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,896
Great.

96
00:06:06,131 --> 00:06:36,356
Criminal Team
http://experts.heberg-forum.net/

97
00:06:36,917 --> 00:06:38,337
<i>Tennessee Williams said,</i>

98
00:06:38,379 --> 00:06:41,160
<i>"We're all of us sentenced
to solitary confinement</i>

99
00:06:41,202 --> 00:06:43,235
<i>inside our own skins, for life."</i>

100
00:06:43,382 --> 00:06:46,213
Clearly this unsub doesn't care
about his victims being found.

101
00:06:46,255 --> 00:06:48,079
Or he knows he can't
be linked to them.

102
00:06:48,121 --> 00:06:50,195
Yet the M.E.'s report supports that.

103
00:06:50,237 --> 00:06:52,676
Matching dna was found
on all 5 victims.

104
00:06:52,718 --> 00:06:54,612
- But not in any database.
- Right.

105
00:06:54,654 --> 00:06:57,249
It's also in keeping with
the victimology and abduction sites.

106
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:00,032
- Which are what?
- Target rich and offender friendly.

107
00:07:00,074 --> 00:07:03,574
Time of death from time of abduction
varies dramatically in each case.

108
00:07:03,655 --> 00:07:07,208
Some lived 12 hours,
others 24 before they were killed.

109
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:10,165
- So what's he doing with them?
- Well, he's not having sex with them.

110
00:07:10,207 --> 00:07:12,264
There's no sign of torture
or even restraints.

111
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:13,735
What was the matching DNA?

112
00:07:13,777 --> 00:07:16,468
Uh, skin. That and metal
shavings were found

113
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,342
under the fingernails
of all 5 victims.

114
00:07:18,384 --> 00:07:21,447
Tanya only had one nail left.

115
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:22,874
One nail?

116
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:26,188
Yeah. It looks like whatever she was in,
she tried to claw her way out.

117
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,772
JJ, have Garcia match victimology

118
00:07:28,814 --> 00:07:31,819
and abduction sites to hsk
findings for the last year.

119
00:07:31,861 --> 00:07:33,692
If he sticks to this timeline,

120
00:07:33,734 --> 00:07:36,283
Edgewood is about
to discover another body.

121
00:07:46,392 --> 00:07:49,200
So she was abducted 32.
9 miles west of here,

122
00:07:49,242 --> 00:07:51,636
which means if they drove
the speed limit they got here

123
00:07:51,678 --> 00:07:53,089
in 30 minutes or less.

124
00:07:54,112 --> 00:07:57,441
So, how long's it gonna take you
to get in that ditch?

125
00:07:58,058 --> 00:08:00,397
Get in that ditch?
I got shot in the knee, remember?

126
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:02,815
My doctor said I'm not
allowed to do any climbing.

127
00:08:03,237 --> 00:08:04,587
It's a ditch.

128
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,801
New boots, huh?

129
00:08:08,924 --> 00:08:10,072
Italian leather?

130
00:08:10,618 --> 00:08:12,236
Yeah, what can I tell you?

131
00:08:12,905 --> 00:08:13,951
So, uh,

132
00:08:14,486 --> 00:08:17,402
from here I can be seen
by any passing vehicle.

133
00:08:17,801 --> 00:08:19,123
And I can't.

134
00:08:19,314 --> 00:08:21,667
- So she was dumped at night.
- Must have.

135
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:22,751
He drives up,

136
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,992
dumps the body.
Job done,

137
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:26,297
he leaves.

138
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:27,799
I don't think so.

139
00:08:28,353 --> 00:08:29,379
What?

140
00:08:29,421 --> 00:08:31,927
All 5 victims were found
posed in the fetal position

141
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:35,139
<i>with their right arm palm-up,
left arm palm-down.</i>

142
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,419
Remorse?

143
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,474
Or staging.

144
00:08:37,794 --> 00:08:38,976
To look like what?

145
00:08:39,121 --> 00:08:40,521
Like they're asleep.

146
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,521
You have any ideas why?

147
00:08:45,553 --> 00:08:46,605
No.

148
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:50,972
Well, I guess there is
a first time for everything.

149
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,814
Hey, rossi, I'm gonna need a little bit
of help getting out of this ditch.

150
00:08:55,978 --> 00:08:57,011
Rossi!

151
00:08:58,975 --> 00:09:00,045
Hey...

152
00:09:00,722 --> 00:09:01,861
I got it.

153
00:09:01,952 --> 00:09:04,320
Listen, I appreciate you
guys coming down here,

154
00:09:04,362 --> 00:09:05,753
but I only got one body.

155
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:08,005
Which we believe is
the work of a serial killer.

156
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,761
Doesn't it have to be more
than one to be a series?

157
00:09:10,803 --> 00:09:13,469
If you include a slightly
larger area than just Edgewood,

158
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,202
we've got 5 bodies.

159
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,806
All strangled, all staged,
and all dumped.

160
00:09:17,996 --> 00:09:20,531
- Why Edgewood?
- It's significant to him.

161
00:09:20,573 --> 00:09:23,187
We believe that he either grew
up here or he lives here now.

162
00:09:23,432 --> 00:09:25,750
Look, I'm sorry that somebody's
driving through my town

163
00:09:25,792 --> 00:09:28,606
and dumping bodies,
but it doesn't mean he lives here.

164
00:09:28,882 --> 00:09:31,622
We're searching for more victims
through the HSK database.

165
00:09:31,664 --> 00:09:32,649
What's that?

166
00:09:32,691 --> 00:09:35,449
Highway serial killer database.
We started it a few years ago

167
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,401
to track bodies found off
of major highways all over the country.

168
00:09:38,443 --> 00:09:40,487
Law enforcement,
no matter how small the town,

169
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:43,298
reports the murders and we use
the database to try to connect them.

170
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,735
Whoever's killing these
women isn't slowing down,

171
00:09:45,777 --> 00:09:48,392
and he's about to dump another
body on your doorstep.

172
00:10:18,664 --> 00:10:19,718
Oh, god.

173
00:10:19,976 --> 00:10:21,142
Oh, my god.

174
00:10:25,156 --> 00:10:27,594
Stop! Stop!
What do you want?!

175
00:10:28,057 --> 00:10:30,313
I'll do anything.
Just tell me what you want!

176
00:10:30,355 --> 00:10:32,172
I want you to be quiet.

177
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:35,216
Ok, ok,

178
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:36,974
I'll stop.
What else?

179
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,714
What else do you want?

180
00:10:40,119 --> 00:10:41,168
To talk.

181
00:10:45,331 --> 00:10:46,869
Ok, we can talk.

182
00:10:47,682 --> 00:10:49,554
We can talk.
I want to talk.

183
00:10:50,662 --> 00:10:52,133
I want to do that.

184
00:11:10,659 --> 00:11:12,474
Here's an m.E.
File of another victim.

185
00:11:12,525 --> 00:11:15,466
We know that all these women
were strangled by the same unsub.

186
00:11:15,636 --> 00:11:17,828
There's evidence found by dna and

187
00:11:17,903 --> 00:11:19,528
metal fragments under their fingernails

188
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:20,854
But there's something else.

189
00:11:21,024 --> 00:11:23,729
Tanya had diesel
fuel on her clothing.

190
00:11:24,464 --> 00:11:27,313
Well, she was found off the freeway
I'm sure they all had.

191
00:11:27,483 --> 00:11:29,431
They all did. And sugar.

192
00:11:29,794 --> 00:11:32,421
Table sugar was found on almost
all the victims' clothing.

193
00:11:32,571 --> 00:11:33,373
Sugar?

194
00:11:34,073 --> 00:11:36,983
It absorbs diesel fuel.
It's a trucker trick.

195
00:11:37,495 --> 00:11:39,672
We know how he's transporting them.

196
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:03,807
I'm thirsty.

197
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,467
Please, I need a drink.

198
00:12:10,743 --> 00:12:12,483
I have some questions first.

199
00:12:12,653 --> 00:12:13,560
Anything.

200
00:12:14,737 --> 00:12:16,507
What do you want to know?

201
00:12:17,183 --> 00:12:18,932
Well, it's important...

202
00:12:20,144 --> 00:12:22,547
It's important that you listen.

203
00:12:23,412 --> 00:12:24,616
Are we clear?

204
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:26,336
Ok.

205
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,721
Are you religious?

206
00:12:31,972 --> 00:12:33,678
What? I'm sorry?

207
00:12:34,903 --> 00:12:36,452
Do you believe in god?

208
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:44,287
Yeah.

209
00:12:48,014 --> 00:12:49,795
Do you want children?

210
00:12:51,725 --> 00:12:52,776
Someday...

211
00:12:54,849 --> 00:12:55,642
Maybe.

212
00:13:02,502 --> 00:13:03,610
Yeah, I do.

213
00:13:05,502 --> 00:13:07,359
I do. I really want kids.

214
00:13:10,834 --> 00:13:12,493
I don't believe you do.

215
00:13:14,849 --> 00:13:15,587
No--

216
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:18,722
let me out of here!

217
00:13:26,827 --> 00:13:29,780
Courtney, it doesn't mean he
won't invite you to the prom.

218
00:13:29,904 --> 00:13:32,696
Seriously, mom,
you just wouldn't understand.

219
00:13:32,761 --> 00:13:34,855
You know, I did go to
high school at one time.

220
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,700
Yeah, like 50 years ago.

221
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:39,949
I don't even know why I'm
talking to you about this.

222
00:13:40,165 --> 00:13:42,356
I'm just gonna let that one go.

223
00:13:44,434 --> 00:13:45,695
Thank goodness.

224
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:54,209
Courtney?

225
00:14:58,962 --> 00:15:00,477
Courtney, is that you?

226
00:15:02,445 --> 00:15:04,732
Hey, will you stop fooling around.

227
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:22,272
All right.

228
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,976
All right, thanks, baby girl.

229
00:15:25,701 --> 00:15:29,358
Garcia says there's 782 truckers
working and living in this county.

230
00:15:29,484 --> 00:15:31,589
We gotta narrow down
the specific routes.

231
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,067
We'll need more than that.

232
00:15:33,134 --> 00:15:34,809
The daughter confirmed.

233
00:15:34,909 --> 00:15:36,606
Definitely driving a big rig.

234
00:15:36,707 --> 00:15:39,235
Now, she wasn't able to make
out any logos or see the plate.

235
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:40,970
I'd like to talk to her.

236
00:15:44,847 --> 00:15:47,440
I got checkpoints at every
route in and out of the county.

237
00:15:47,543 --> 00:15:49,787
If he's on the road,
we'll find him.

238
00:15:50,134 --> 00:15:51,730
He doesn't hunt at rest stops.

239
00:15:51,781 --> 00:15:53,010
He just did.

240
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:54,987
It's way too isolated here.

241
00:15:55,051 --> 00:15:56,756
It's a perfect place
to take somebody.

242
00:15:56,797 --> 00:15:58,056
Not for this guy.

243
00:15:58,121 --> 00:15:59,896
He goes to
offender friendly environments

244
00:15:59,942 --> 00:16:02,098
So he can blend in and still
interact with his victims.

245
00:16:02,155 --> 00:16:03,667
He hasn't had a chance to do that.

246
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:06,433
Well, if he's from here,
why would he need a rest stop?

247
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:09,506
Clean up, maybe.

248
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:11,550
You check the rest rooms yet?

249
00:16:11,643 --> 00:16:14,375
Yeah, the sink is full of
dirt in the men's room.

250
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:24,481
This is a dump site.
It's not an abduction site.

251
00:16:25,801 --> 00:16:28,056
He must have dumped a body
around here somewhere.

252
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,557
Sheriff, I want you to have
your officers spread out.

253
00:16:30,635 --> 00:16:32,864
Tell them to start
with the ditches.

254
00:16:38,719 --> 00:16:41,739
Any distinguishing marks?
Anything at all?

255
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,217
I wasn't looking.
I was texting.

256
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:49,962
I heard a truck start.

257
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:52,722
When I went to the bathroom,
she was gone.

258
00:16:54,026 --> 00:16:56,035
How are you gonna find her?

259
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,595
There's a good chance
he's gonna stay here.

260
00:16:58,696 --> 00:17:00,161
Why wouldn't he just run?

261
00:17:00,207 --> 00:17:02,110
Because he always comes
back to edgewood.

262
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,240
Your mother is the first
woman he's taken from here.

263
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,320
We were just driving through.

264
00:17:07,405 --> 00:17:08,837
We live in phoenix.

265
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:13,347
Mom was just trying to get me home
so I could go to tryouts.

266
00:17:14,337 --> 00:17:16,726
You have to find her.
She's all I have.

267
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:20,342
You should come
down to the station.

268
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,419
Excuse me.

269
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,038
Hey, where are you?

270
00:17:26,224 --> 00:17:29,071
I'm in the woods south of you.
You need to see this.

271
00:17:32,988 --> 00:17:35,414
Strangled, metal
shavings under her nails.

272
00:17:36,825 --> 00:17:38,975
He dumps her body,
he cleans up at the rest stop,

273
00:17:39,056 --> 00:17:41,567
And then just happens to
stumble onto nancy campbell.

274
00:17:41,737 --> 00:17:44,422
So he didn't wait a
minute between victims,

275
00:17:44,592 --> 00:17:47,024
And he left the
daughter as a witness.

276
00:17:47,376 --> 00:17:49,860
Hey. What's going on with him?

277
00:17:50,433 --> 00:17:52,763
That's what we need to find out.

278
00:17:59,868 --> 00:18:00,530
Ok.

279
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,830
Latest victim is younger
than the others.

280
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,832
- Was she posed as well?
- Yeah.

281
00:18:05,923 --> 00:18:08,242
Nancy campbell's
abduction hit the news.

282
00:18:08,412 --> 00:18:09,854
Let's hope he doesn't see it.

283
00:18:09,944 --> 00:18:13,180
He could panic and then he'll
dump her faster than the last one.

284
00:18:13,181 --> 00:18:16,528
Why has he dumped one victim and
taken another within the hour?

285
00:18:17,538 --> 00:18:18,987
What have you got, garcia?

286
00:18:19,157 --> 00:18:21,320
A bloody and busy trucker.

287
00:18:21,556 --> 00:18:23,069
I have been on the hsk myself.

288
00:18:23,239 --> 00:18:25,416
I've connected 4 more
victims to this guy.

289
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,149
I'm sending their names to you now.

290
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:28,978
Brings his count to 10.

291
00:18:29,184 --> 00:18:32,480
We need to get photos of the victims
garcia identified up on the board.

292
00:18:32,566 --> 00:18:34,575
If we figure out why he's
choosing these women,

293
00:18:34,689 --> 00:18:35,604
We find him.

294
00:18:36,628 --> 00:18:37,546
please!

295
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:41,627
Please, let me out!
I can't breathe!

296
00:18:48,184 --> 00:18:49,774
Why are you doing this?

297
00:18:51,915 --> 00:18:54,208
Keep quiet and the light stays on.

298
00:18:55,673 --> 00:18:57,814
What--what do you want?

299
00:18:58,427 --> 00:18:59,992
What do you want?

300
00:19:01,071 --> 00:19:01,788
You.

301
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:06,085
No...Please...

302
00:19:06,758 --> 00:19:07,751
Please...

303
00:19:10,394 --> 00:19:11,594
What's all this?

304
00:19:11,636 --> 00:19:13,036
There are 4 more victims?

305
00:19:13,178 --> 00:19:15,725
He started killing
months before we thought.

306
00:19:15,884 --> 00:19:19,193
His first victim was erika joy
from lexington, south carolina.

307
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:20,824
She disappeared from a truck stop.

308
00:19:20,852 --> 00:19:22,302
What did she do for a living?

309
00:19:22,381 --> 00:19:24,637
According to her rap sheet,
everyone she could.

310
00:19:24,683 --> 00:19:25,869
So she's a lot lizard.

311
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,357
It's a name they give prostitutes
who hang around truck stops.

312
00:19:28,394 --> 00:19:29,541
What about the others?

313
00:19:29,605 --> 00:19:32,010
Waitress, gas station attendant,
female trucker.

314
00:19:32,011 --> 00:19:33,111
Any of them married?

315
00:19:33,162 --> 00:19:36,120
Just nancy campbell, the latest
abductee, but she's a widow.

316
00:19:36,246 --> 00:19:39,427
Yeah, well, her mom's gonna get
a lot more attention than...

317
00:19:39,563 --> 00:19:41,418
Well, all these other women.

318
00:19:42,406 --> 00:19:44,743
Taking nancy campbell
was a huge risk.

319
00:19:44,838 --> 00:19:46,303
It doesn't fit his m.O.

320
00:19:46,355 --> 00:19:48,304
He must have had a reason.

321
00:19:49,727 --> 00:19:51,653
We just got some new information.

322
00:19:51,821 --> 00:19:53,080
Come with me.

323
00:19:55,363 --> 00:19:57,285
Sorry. I'll be back in a minute.

324
00:19:57,737 --> 00:19:59,833
He had to have walked
right by that minivan.

325
00:19:59,902 --> 00:20:01,628
Why didn't he take courtney?

326
00:20:01,819 --> 00:20:03,037
Maybe she's too young.

327
00:20:03,123 --> 00:20:05,404
She's closer to the victims'
ages than her mother.

328
00:20:05,574 --> 00:20:07,397
That parking lot was deserted.

329
00:20:07,476 --> 00:20:09,821
He could have taken courtney,
nobody would have seen a thing,

330
00:20:09,887 --> 00:20:11,913
But instead, he walks past her--

331
00:20:11,914 --> 00:20:15,042
Because that's not who he wants.
He watched nancy.

332
00:20:15,485 --> 00:20:17,437
He followed her
because he wanted her.

333
00:20:17,503 --> 00:20:19,687
So much so that he left
courtney as a witness?

334
00:20:19,795 --> 00:20:21,255
What could be that important?

335
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:23,777
Well, until a few hours ago,
he had a type.

336
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:26,145
The other victims were younger,
less sophisticated.

337
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:29,268
It wouldn't take more than a day to
figure out if they're worthy or not.

338
00:20:29,379 --> 00:20:30,314
Of what?

339
00:20:31,076 --> 00:20:32,664
Being his companion.

340
00:20:33,827 --> 00:20:35,738
Then he's completely delusional.

341
00:20:35,922 --> 00:20:37,735
There are easier ways
to figure that out.

342
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:39,303
No, not for this guy.

343
00:20:39,365 --> 00:20:41,638
He's got a schedule that
forces him to stay on the road.

344
00:20:41,703 --> 00:20:43,139
He's alone for long stretches.

345
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,890
He can't devote any
real time to courting.

346
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:48,411
You really think he's killing

347
00:20:48,504 --> 00:20:50,179
Because he's lonely?

348
00:20:51,347 --> 00:20:52,891
It wouldn't surprise me.

349
00:20:54,282 --> 00:20:56,169
How are the pancakes, princess?

350
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,821
Not as good as yours.

351
00:20:59,646 --> 00:21:00,777
Excuse me.

352
00:21:01,512 --> 00:21:03,284
Look, daddy. Do you like it?

353
00:21:03,454 --> 00:21:04,563
Well, now...

354
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:07,549
Yeah, that's beautiful.

355
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,672
You know, your daddy
really misses you.

356
00:21:13,584 --> 00:21:15,490
Can you tell me another story?

357
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:16,216
Ok.

358
00:21:17,669 --> 00:21:18,387
So...

359
00:21:18,818 --> 00:21:21,193
The lonely king had
all but given up hope

360
00:21:21,243 --> 00:21:23,705
Of ever finding the
beautiful queen.

361
00:21:34,588 --> 00:21:35,993
When all of a sudden...

362
00:21:37,632 --> 00:21:38,905
She appeared.

363
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:50,065
Now, this time it was different.

364
00:21:51,499 --> 00:21:54,236
This time, He knew she was the one.

365
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:02,122
This time...

366
00:22:03,483 --> 00:22:04,697
She was perfect.

367
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,883
Courtney?

368
00:22:10,551 --> 00:22:11,829
Courtney, is that you?

369
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,456
Hey, will you stop fooling around.

370
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,380
Sorry, sweetie, it's time to go.

371
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:21,589
Do we have to?

372
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:22,966
It's time for school.

373
00:22:24,031 --> 00:22:24,792
Here.

374
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:27,762
Why don't you go pick out
a candy bar to put in your lunch.

375
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:31,057
Hey, princess, don't worry.

376
00:22:31,626 --> 00:22:33,101
We'll be a family again {\real }soon.

377
00:22:38,255 --> 00:22:40,172
You've got to stop telling her that.

378
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,440
Why? It's true.

379
00:22:43,143 --> 00:22:46,781
Nothing's changed. The judge
isn't gonna let her live with you.

380
00:22:48,528 --> 00:22:49,492
I am trying...

381
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,911
She's being placed with
her adoptive family.

382
00:22:53,366 --> 00:22:55,019
She is my daughter.

383
00:22:56,102 --> 00:22:59,014
You people can't just take her away.
You can't just do that!

384
00:22:59,139 --> 00:23:02,146
- I have more time.
- Mr. Hatchett, please.

385
00:23:05,852 --> 00:23:08,803
I wanted you to see her,
but clearly that was a mistake.

386
00:23:11,018 --> 00:23:14,194
You've known for months now
that this was a possibility.

387
00:23:15,774 --> 00:23:18,396
- I'm gonna make this work.
- By this afternoon?

388
00:23:20,426 --> 00:23:22,153
You can't take care of her.

389
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,992
You can barely take
care of yourself.

390
00:23:25,117 --> 00:23:26,988
You're living in your truck.

391
00:23:27,424 --> 00:23:30,307
You're on the road,
and without a wife

392
00:23:30,775 --> 00:23:31,826
or a home,

393
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:33,000
You just...

394
00:23:33,263 --> 00:23:34,829
you can't do it.

395
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,373
You gotta let her go.

396
00:23:38,233 --> 00:23:39,565
Let her be happy.

397
00:23:40,297 --> 00:23:42,837
I know you want that for Jody.
Her mom

398
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:45,814
- would want what's best for her.
- I'm what's best for her.

399
00:23:46,398 --> 00:23:50,012
Look, I made a promise that I would
not let anything happen to her.

400
00:23:50,832 --> 00:23:52,998
She is my little girl.

401
00:23:54,081 --> 00:23:55,349
No one's gonna

402
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:58,807
love her the way that I can.
Why can't you understand that?

403
00:24:02,862 --> 00:24:04,018
You all set?

404
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,540
- I love you, daddy.
- Oh, hey.

405
00:24:09,668 --> 00:24:10,907
I love you, too.

406
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:17,366
What about the queen?

407
00:24:17,615 --> 00:24:18,785
Is she the one?

408
00:24:20,586 --> 00:24:21,683
I don't know.

409
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:25,171
The story's not over yet, princess.

410
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:36,148
Nancy campbell's been
missing over 12 hours.

411
00:24:36,273 --> 00:24:38,914
If he jumped on the I-40 before
we got the police blocks out.

412
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,841
He could be 3 states over by now.
We don't think he has time for that.

413
00:24:41,966 --> 00:24:44,307
He's courting these women.
He needs them in edgewood.

414
00:24:44,354 --> 00:24:46,058
There are over 800 truckers
on this list.

415
00:24:46,096 --> 00:24:48,251
We have to get Darcia to run
background on all of them.

416
00:24:48,307 --> 00:24:50,822
He's either parked at his own house
or he's hiding in plain sight.

417
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,105
I've already given you a list Of all
the trucker stops that we've checked

418
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:57,044
- in town.
- We gonna need to check them again.

419
00:25:08,644 --> 00:25:11,756
I've searched for you for a long time.
Did you know that?

420
00:25:12,669 --> 00:25:15,305
You know how important family is,
don't you?

421
00:25:15,857 --> 00:25:17,496
See, I knew you would.

422
00:25:17,804 --> 00:25:19,676
You're not like the others.

423
00:25:20,335 --> 00:25:22,603
Oh, would you like some water?

424
00:25:24,111 --> 00:25:25,486
No, thank you.

425
00:25:26,569 --> 00:25:28,017
That's not polite.

426
00:25:29,305 --> 00:25:31,647
I'm sharing with you.
You should accept.

427
00:25:35,086 --> 00:25:37,208
Yeah, please. That would be great.

428
00:25:37,822 --> 00:25:39,095
Much better.

429
00:25:40,574 --> 00:25:43,400
You know, family's everything.
With family, you're...

430
00:25:43,426 --> 00:25:45,042
you're never alone.

431
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,528
Please...

432
00:25:46,938 --> 00:25:48,752
If our daughter were crying...

433
00:25:50,172 --> 00:25:52,638
What would you do
to get her to stop?

434
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,668
Please let me go.

435
00:25:55,561 --> 00:25:57,361
If our daughter were crying,

436
00:25:57,976 --> 00:26:00,229
what would you do
to get her to stop?

437
00:26:02,205 --> 00:26:03,449
I don't know.

438
00:26:05,876 --> 00:26:08,159
I'd tell her a story.
I would...

439
00:26:08,715 --> 00:26:10,442
I'd hold her.
I don't know.

440
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,928
You like stories?

441
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:13,793
Our daughter likes stories.

442
00:26:17,032 --> 00:26:19,154
Look at you. You're a mess.

443
00:26:20,193 --> 00:26:22,390
I don't want the princess to see you

444
00:26:22,652 --> 00:26:24,071
All dirty like that.

445
00:26:31,803 --> 00:26:33,164
I have a daughter.

446
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:36,295
Please let me go.

447
00:26:41,226 --> 00:26:42,500
Please let me go.

448
00:26:42,778 --> 00:26:43,670
Please!

449
00:26:44,329 --> 00:26:45,295
Please!

450
00:26:45,997 --> 00:26:47,166
Let me go!

451
00:26:48,366 --> 00:26:49,376
Please...

452
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:51,293
Please let me go!

453
00:26:51,688 --> 00:26:52,785
Let me go!

454
00:26:54,454 --> 00:26:55,522
Please...

455
00:27:24,297 --> 00:27:26,023
That's fine. Thanks.

456
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:31,365
- Is this about that missing woman?
- Do you know anything about it?

457
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:33,048
Only what I saw on the news.

458
00:27:33,173 --> 00:27:36,017
We have reason to believe that our
suspect Has been in your facility

459
00:27:36,142 --> 00:27:37,905
- in the past 24 hours.
- Here?

460
00:27:38,212 --> 00:27:40,568
- You think he's here?
- We could really use your help.

461
00:27:41,417 --> 00:27:43,327
Well, we could give
you our manifest.

462
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,441
It logs all the truckers
and their loads.

463
00:27:45,566 --> 00:27:47,310
That's exactly what we need.

464
00:27:50,442 --> 00:27:52,336
All right, get up.
You're coming with me.

465
00:27:52,974 --> 00:27:55,298
- I said get up!
- All right. Take it easy!

466
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,645
It's your dime, Mr. Amazing.

467
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:01,846
{\Listen, }I might have something
to narrow your search.

468
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:04,916
We don't think he drives for a company.
The schedules are way too tight.

469
00:28:04,955 --> 00:28:07,480
In the past few months, he's had
the flexibility to hunt and kill,

470
00:28:07,548 --> 00:28:09,361
and he couldn't do all
that and run loads.

471
00:28:09,436 --> 00:28:12,793
So you need me to narrow down
The independent contractors.

472
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:14,608
You're reading my mind, red.

473
00:28:14,654 --> 00:28:17,430
I just emailed you the manifest from
the local depot where all the truckers

474
00:28:17,555 --> 00:28:19,478
- check in. Can you...
- Of course I can.

475
00:28:20,701 --> 00:28:23,241
76 licenses registered
under own authority,

476
00:28:23,366 --> 00:28:25,369
- and I just sent them back to you.
- Woman,

477
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,421
- you are good.
- You have no idea.

478
00:28:28,602 --> 00:28:30,885
How many of these cases
have you worked on?

479
00:28:31,564 --> 00:28:32,606
Too many.

480
00:28:34,409 --> 00:28:36,832
How many of these women
have you gotten back alive?

481
00:28:37,662 --> 00:28:40,343
All right, let's go over this again.
This offender's preferential,

482
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:42,122
young women mid to late 20s.

483
00:28:42,247 --> 00:28:45,611
He takes his time watching them.
He makes sure there are no witnesses.

484
00:28:45,879 --> 00:28:48,232
He kills them 12 to 24
hours after abduction.

485
00:28:48,357 --> 00:28:50,339
Only now that timeframe's
getting shorter.

486
00:28:50,464 --> 00:28:53,488
Then he comes home to edgewood
Where he's home and he feels safe.

487
00:28:53,875 --> 00:28:55,816
Courtney, listen, this man,

488
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:57,890
he doesn't try to hide his victims.

489
00:28:58,015 --> 00:28:59,787
So you think she's still alive?

490
00:29:02,374 --> 00:29:03,814
I was so rude to her.

491
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:06,657
I just don't want the last thing
I said to her to have been...

492
00:29:06,782 --> 00:29:08,319
If he had hurt her,

493
00:29:08,554 --> 00:29:10,286
we would have found her already.

494
00:29:12,312 --> 00:29:14,835
- So what's he doing to her?
- There's no rape involved.

495
00:29:15,542 --> 00:29:17,310
So is it companionship he's after?

496
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:20,716
There might be an almost
chivalrous aspect to this.

497
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:23,469
- How do you figure?
- Truckers have a romanticized image

498
00:29:23,594 --> 00:29:26,493
of themselves, in fact all lifestyles
revolving around the open road do.

499
00:29:26,618 --> 00:29:28,307
The hell's angels,
for instance, They

500
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,601
refer to their women
as their old ladies, but in fact,

501
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,850
there's no one they'd
rather protect or die for.

502
00:29:32,975 --> 00:29:35,600
Their treatment of women wouldn't be
out of place in king arthur's court.

503
00:29:35,725 --> 00:29:38,195
And their sense of isolation
would amp up their fantasy.

504
00:29:38,418 --> 00:29:40,970
He's looking for a wife.
He starts out with easy targets,

505
00:29:41,095 --> 00:29:43,545
Then he moves on to women Who
could actually fill the role.

506
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:45,751
Sweet, outgoing, warm.

507
00:29:45,861 --> 00:29:48,192
The bartender who takes
extra care of you,

508
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,931
- the chatty hitchhiker.
- But over the course of the day,

509
00:29:51,056 --> 00:29:53,190
They fail the test.
This infuriates him,

510
00:29:53,315 --> 00:29:55,215
and he strangles
them and dumps them.

511
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,282
OK, so why take Nancy Campbell?

512
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:59,928
She's the opposite of all
the other victims he's taken.

513
00:30:00,053 --> 00:30:02,341
It's true. She's older.
She already has a kid.

514
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,554
Maybe that's why she's still alive.

515
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:07,510
What if he's not looking for a companion?
What if he's looking for a mother?

516
00:30:07,635 --> 00:30:09,001
If he's got a kid of his own,

517
00:30:09,029 --> 00:30:11,245
that would explain what keeps
him coming back to edgewood.

518
00:30:11,301 --> 00:30:14,288
It would explain why he walks
past Courtney to get to nancy.

519
00:30:14,413 --> 00:30:16,282
Just by watching
he knows she's a mother.

520
00:30:16,407 --> 00:30:18,483
She's already qualified
to pass any test.

521
00:30:19,044 --> 00:30:19,942
Garcia.

522
00:30:20,365 --> 00:30:21,126
Sir.

523
00:30:21,251 --> 00:30:23,946
<i>I want you to narrow down the own
authority trucker list And tell me which</i>

524
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:26,949
<i>ones have been through a divorce
recently or a custody battle.</i>

525
00:30:27,005 --> 00:30:28,977
<i>Custody fight would be a stressor.</i>

526
00:30:29,099 --> 00:30:32,024
Limit your searches to months
prior to the first murder.

527
00:30:32,125 --> 00:30:33,594
Got it. Thanks.

528
00:30:37,225 --> 00:30:38,247
What's going on?

529
00:30:38,286 --> 00:30:39,449
Just hold on a second.

530
00:30:39,542 --> 00:30:40,732
Wait, what's going on?

531
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:42,495
They found a
body off the I-40.

532
00:30:42,588 --> 00:30:43,978
No identification.

533
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,118
Is she dead?

534
00:30:48,986 --> 00:30:50,469
We don't know.

535
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,471
What do you mean you don't know?

536
00:30:54,124 --> 00:30:57,643
The police found a body and they
aren't sure if it's your mother.

537
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,010
I want to go.

538
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,585
I think we should wait here.

539
00:31:04,636 --> 00:31:05,935
I need to see if it's her.

540
00:31:06,029 --> 00:31:07,150
Courtney, please,

541
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,653
Dr. Reid and I are going
to stay here with you,

542
00:31:09,823 --> 00:31:12,459
And as soon as we know anything,
we will tell you.

543
00:31:12,629 --> 00:31:13,418
Ok?

544
00:31:36,816 --> 00:31:38,226
I'll call emily.

545
00:31:38,488 --> 00:31:39,838
Are you sure?

546
00:31:40,186 --> 00:31:41,680
Ok, thanks.

547
00:31:41,985 --> 00:31:43,352
It's not your mother.

548
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,476
Hey, baby girl, talk to me.

549
00:31:46,646 --> 00:31:48,858
Of your 76 independent truckers,

550
00:31:48,909 --> 00:31:52,694
I have 28 who are currently
involved in custody cases.

551
00:31:52,745 --> 00:31:54,552
How many of those
cases are still open?

552
00:31:54,614 --> 00:31:55,862
8 pending.

553
00:31:56,032 --> 00:31:58,102
Not the most relationship
friendly job, trucking.

554
00:31:58,272 --> 00:32:00,003
Look for instances
where the mother died.

555
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:02,820
A guy like this wouldn't tear a
child away from his own mother.

556
00:32:03,335 --> 00:32:05,372
Caroline hatchett
died in a house fire,

557
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,301
Leaving behind a
7-year-old daughter jody

558
00:32:07,393 --> 00:32:08,909
And a husband wade hatchett.

559
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,313
Wade lost his home, his wife,

560
00:32:11,364 --> 00:32:12,715
And custody of his daughter

561
00:32:12,766 --> 00:32:15,153
When the courts deemed him unfit.
He's still contesting the case.

562
00:32:15,232 --> 00:32:16,953
Why was he deemed unfit?

563
00:32:18,541 --> 00:32:21,334
Double whammy--job kept him
away for weeks at a time,

564
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:24,163
And he didn't have any other
family to help him watch the girl.

565
00:32:24,228 --> 00:32:26,560
Looks like he bent over backwards
trying to make it work,

566
00:32:26,626 --> 00:32:29,346
But she missed a lot of school, and he
was charged with neglect of a minor.

567
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:30,563
You have an address?

568
00:32:30,629 --> 00:32:32,099
Just a p.O. Box for over a year.

569
00:32:32,175 --> 00:32:33,395
What about the daughter?

570
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,457
Jody currently resides
in foster care.

571
00:32:35,527 --> 00:32:36,901
I'm sending you the file now.

572
00:32:36,952 --> 00:32:38,402
If this is the same unsub,

573
00:32:38,453 --> 00:32:41,038
He didn't bother to
pose her this time.

574
00:32:41,089 --> 00:32:43,073
This is much more brutal.

575
00:32:43,124 --> 00:32:45,108
It feels personal.

576
00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:46,942
Her name is lynn clemons.

577
00:32:46,993 --> 00:32:49,606
Deputies found her wallet
about 100 yards up.

578
00:32:49,776 --> 00:32:51,594
Must have spilled out
when he dumped her.

579
00:32:51,691 --> 00:32:54,081
Garcia, we need
everything that you have

580
00:32:54,132 --> 00:32:56,083
On a lynn clemons.

581
00:32:56,134 --> 00:32:58,718
Lynn clemons? She's the...

582
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:00,365
Foster parent of jody hatchett.

583
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,835
I was just telling the others

584
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:04,237
Her father is a trucker
who lost custody

585
00:33:04,322 --> 00:33:05,460
When his wife died.

586
00:33:05,561 --> 00:33:07,242
Jody's in the process
of being adopted.

587
00:33:07,412 --> 00:33:08,946
He ran out of time.

588
00:33:09,216 --> 00:33:11,314
Is the team on their
way to his house?

589
00:33:11,484 --> 00:33:12,892
No, he only has a p.O. Box.

590
00:33:13,062 --> 00:33:15,332
He killed the foster parent.

591
00:33:15,876 --> 00:33:17,805
He's going after his daughter.

592
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:21,037
Garcia, where's jody
hatchett right now?

593
00:33:22,871 --> 00:33:23,949
Wait!

594
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:46,706
Hey, jody.

595
00:33:47,002 --> 00:33:48,123
Who are you?

596
00:33:48,293 --> 00:33:49,476
I'm emily.

597
00:33:49,895 --> 00:33:51,547
Where's mrs. Clemons?

598
00:33:51,598 --> 00:33:53,450
Well, I'll tell you inside, ok?

599
00:33:56,515 --> 00:33:57,957
It's ok. Come on.

600
00:34:03,078 --> 00:34:04,261
Jody.

601
00:34:06,618 --> 00:34:07,951
What's going on?

602
00:34:08,121 --> 00:34:09,419
We're helping the police,

603
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,170
and we're trying to find your dad.

604
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,629
Do you know where he is?

605
00:34:12,799 --> 00:34:13,737
No.

606
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:21,259
Hotch, truck's coming
up the road right now.

607
00:34:21,996 --> 00:34:24,714
Hey, jody, can we go
play in your room?

608
00:34:25,283 --> 00:34:26,431
It's right here.

609
00:34:58,644 --> 00:35:00,117
Get up.

610
00:35:08,695 --> 00:35:10,593
Somebody's moving toward
the front of the cab.

611
00:35:10,644 --> 00:35:12,166
All right, it's nancy campbl.

612
00:35:12,336 --> 00:35:14,222
He's behind her and
he's got his gun on her.

613
00:35:14,392 --> 00:35:15,799
Morgan, do you have a shot?

614
00:35:18,412 --> 00:35:19,904
Negative. Negative.

615
00:35:19,955 --> 00:35:21,666
He's using her as a shield.

616
00:35:21,823 --> 00:35:24,652
***************************

617
00:35:24,731 --> 00:35:27,314
Did you paint all of tse yourself?

618
00:35:28,255 --> 00:35:30,861
It loo like they're... Sleeping?

619
00:35:31,335 --> 00:35:34,418
Yeah. The king tucks them in,
just like my daddy does for me.

620
00:35:34,785 --> 00:35:36,920
Is this your mom here, this one?

621
00:35:36,971 --> 00:35:38,621
No. That's the queen.

622
00:35:38,672 --> 00:35:39,929
Who's that?

623
00:35:40,099 --> 00:35:43,075
She's the one that the king
tried to take home to the castle,

624
00:35:43,245 --> 00:35:44,829
but she didn't make it.

625
00:35:45,371 --> 00:35:46,831
What happened  her?

626
00:35:46,882 --> 00:35:48,566
Her carriage broke down,

627
00:35:48,617 --> 00:35:51,169
And he had to leave her
behind to save the princess.

628
00:35:52,221 --> 00:35:54,639
There's a lot of queens here.

629
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:56,475
They all look different.

630
00:35:56,526 --> 00:35:57,345
They are.

631
00:35:57,432 --> 00:35:59,278
What happened to this one here?

632
00:35:59,329 --> 00:36:00,446
She was dirty.

633
00:36:00,497 --> 00:36:02,802
The king said, "how do you expect
"to give my daughter a bath

634
00:36:02,972 --> 00:36:04,918
If you can't even
take one yourself?"

635
00:36:04,969 --> 00:36:06,353
I like that story.

636
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:10,042
Do you make up all these stories?

637
00:36:10,212 --> 00:36:11,671
No. My daddy does.

638
00:36:11,841 --> 00:36:13,370
I like painting them.

639
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,971
Well, this story isn't
over yet, is it?

640
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:18,467
That's what my dad said.

641
00:36:18,637 --> 00:36:19,759
He did?

642
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:21,703
Today we were eating pancakes,

643
00:36:21,754 --> 00:36:24,272
And he said she was perfect.

644
00:36:26,141 --> 00:36:29,207
Hey, would you like
to meet a queen?

645
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:34,809
Where's jody?

646
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,041
I don't see her.
What did they do with her?

647
00:36:37,092 --> 00:36:38,708
How old is jody?

648
00:36:38,759 --> 00:36:41,375
Do you think she'll like me?

649
00:36:41,426 --> 00:36:44,544
Daddy? Daddy, are you there?

650
00:36:49,099 --> 00:36:50,549
Hi, baby.

651
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,551
You need to tell me
the rest of the story.

652
00:36:57,138 --> 00:37:00,353
Well, the lonely king and
the queen are at the castle.

653
00:37:00,523 --> 00:37:02,225
To pick up the princess?

654
00:37:02,276 --> 00:37:04,260
No, the guards are in the way.

655
00:37:08,093 --> 00:37:10,098
Will you let the
queen talk to them?

656
00:37:11,316 --> 00:37:12,557
They won't listen.

657
00:37:12,938 --> 00:37:14,118
But I want to see her.

658
00:37:14,288 --> 00:37:16,070
Will you let her go
so she can hold me?

659
00:37:16,391 --> 00:37:18,072
You said that she's perfect,

660
00:37:18,123 --> 00:37:19,373
That she's the one.

661
00:37:19,424 --> 00:37:22,210
She wants to live in
a big castle with me.

662
00:37:27,733 --> 00:37:29,257
I need to see you.

663
00:37:53,226 --> 00:37:54,749
Hi, daddy!

664
00:37:59,631 --> 00:38:01,366
Hi, princess.

665
00:38:12,927 --> 00:38:14,861
She's so pretty, daddy!

666
00:38:14,912 --> 00:38:16,162
Go, go.

667
00:38:23,619 --> 00:38:26,836
Now the king won't
be lonely anymore.

668
00:38:29,454 --> 00:38:32,605
And they're gonna live
happily ever after.

669
00:38:32,656 --> 00:38:34,838
Why aren't you coming, too, daddy?

670
00:38:34,889 --> 00:38:37,078
You did a great job, jody.

671
00:38:37,374 --> 00:38:39,104
Are you going to the better place?

672
00:38:39,155 --> 00:38:40,014
What?

673
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:43,940
Yeah. We're both going to
a better place, princess.

674
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:46,310
Close your little eyes, sweet pea.

675
00:38:46,361 --> 00:38:47,778
Hatchett!

676
00:38:47,829 --> 00:38:49,380
Turn around.

677
00:39:42,304 --> 00:39:43,754
Christopher lasch said,

678
00:39:43,805 --> 00:39:46,859
"family is a haven in
a heartless world."

679
00:40:01,069 --> 00:40:02,435
What you reading?

680
00:40:04,124 --> 00:40:05,971
The hsk database.

681
00:40:06,022 --> 00:40:08,707
Do you know there's probably
half a dozen serial killers

682
00:40:08,758 --> 00:40:11,676
Driving around right now?

683
00:40:11,727 --> 00:40:13,544
What's really bothering you?

684
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,780
Jody lost her mom

685
00:40:17,831 --> 00:40:19,749
And then her dad,

686
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,251
And the couple that was
gonna adopt her backed out.

687
00:40:22,302 --> 00:40:24,086
It's all over the news.
It's just...

688
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,758
It's just not fair.

689
00:40:28,845 --> 00:40:31,265
Her aunt saw the story.

690
00:40:31,316 --> 00:40:33,268
She came forward.

691
00:40:33,319 --> 00:40:35,005
She'd lost touch with jody's mom

692
00:40:35,056 --> 00:40:38,311
Over the past few years,
but she's her only living relative

693
00:40:38,362 --> 00:40:40,148
And she wants to raise jody.

694
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:41,750
Really?

695
00:40:47,287 --> 00:40:49,358
You know, prentiss,

696
00:40:50,062 --> 00:40:52,227
When I think about the things
we see on a daily basis,

697
00:40:52,969 --> 00:40:54,014
All the bad,

698
00:40:55,458 --> 00:40:57,833
I'm still amazed at all the good.

699
00:40:59,107 --> 00:41:00,619
Yeah, but...

700
00:41:01,621 --> 00:41:03,643
Do you think it evens out?

701
00:41:06,626 --> 00:41:08,877
I'd like to think it does.
