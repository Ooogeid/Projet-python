Previously on Criminal Minds...

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:07,470
Get 'em-- morgan,
get 'em off me!

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:09,040
Reid. Reid. Wake up.

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:10,660
What the hell is scaring you?

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,310
The name Riley Jenkins
mean anything to you?

6
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:12,840
No.

7
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,170
He was murdered right here in
las vegas when he was 6 years old.

8
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,570
you would have been
around 4 at the time.

9
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,240
He was found him in the basement
of his own house, behind the dryer.

10
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,960
He'd been sexually abused and stabbed.

11
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,760
Spencer? What are you doing here?

12
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,420
Did i know a boy named riley jenkins?

13
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:31,380
I've been having dreams about
his death since i was little.

14
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:34,510
Why aren't you helping me?

15
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,380
Spencer,pay attention.

16
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,830
Show me your face.

17
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,610
Dad.

18
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:45,100
{\a6}<i>LAS VEGAS.NEVADA</i>

19
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,110
Come on,baby. Give it to me.
Give it to me. See? Nuh-uh.

20
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,750
Morgan,can you--
Please,can you-- My head.

21
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,480
My bad. Sorry.

22
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:54,290
You know these things are rigged,right?

23
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:55,980
Late night?

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,990
I hate vegas.

25
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,380
Come on,prentiss. How
can you hate vegas?

26
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,180
This is a grown folk's playground.

27
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,350
Anyone seen Reid?

28
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,700
I know he stayed with
his mom last night.

29
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,170
Well,he should be here by now.
He knows the departure time.

30
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,560
That thing still has credit on it.

31
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,840
- J.J.,i swear
to god-- - What?

32
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,830
Oh,here he comes right now.

33
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,190
What'd you do? Sleep through your alarm?

34
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,500
Sorry to keep you
guys waiting. I--

35
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,750
Hotch is already at the
airstrip. How fast can you pack?

36
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,390
Actually,i'm gonna stay
for a couple of days.

37
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,290
Is everything all right?

38
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:27,740
Yeah,i just,um-- I haven't seen my mom for a
really long time, so i'd like a few more days.

39
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,230
- You sure?
- Yeah.

40
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,450
Ok,take a few days.
Do what you need to do.

41
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,000
Hey,um,take care of yourself.

42
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:44,230
You,too. Both of you.

43
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,520
Hi,i'm special agent
spencer Reid, with the fbi.

44
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:01,440
I'd like to see everything you have on the
1984 murder of a boy named riley jenkins.

45
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,090
- Just a second.
- Thanks.

46
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,830
That was a rough one.

47
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,190
Did you work the case?

48
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,500
Yeah. I was 3 or 4 blocks away
when the call came in on the radio.

49
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,410
My first kid.

50
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,800
You don't forget those.

51
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,960
Can i ask you this?
Were there any suspects?

52
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,980
The family, initially.
A dad,an older brother.

53
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,780
Makes sense. I heard the boy was
found in his own basement,right?

54
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:30,820
Yeah. After a while,the family
got defensive, stopped cooperating.

55
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:35,160
A bit like the-- what's her
name? The jon-benet case, i guess.

56
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,880
I never liked them for it,anyway.

57
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,290
I always figured it was
somebody outside the home.

58
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,440
What's the bureau's
interest in the case?

59
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,350
Um,research.

60
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,650
Is this everything?

61
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,480
There might be another
box down in records.

62
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,660
I'd like to see it
all, if you don't mind.

63
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,840
Lots of luck,everybody, let's go.

64
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,850
nice shot!

65
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,780
when did you know?

66
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,130
that's it?

67
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,420
That the extent of you...

68
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,560
What are you guys doing here?

69
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,420
Hey,what's it look like we're doing?

70
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,780
Uh,breaking into my room and
watching "days of our lives."

71
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,240
"young and the restless."

72
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,280
aren't you supposed to be
on a plane back to d. C. ?

73
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,470
You're supposed to be
hanging out with your mom.

74
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,040
And you're not.

75
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:48,650
Riley jenkins?

76
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,730
No,it's not-- that's
actually not why i'm here.

77
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,510
Reid?

78
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,400
Come on,man.

79
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:57,090
Who do you think you're talking to?

80
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,100
I know what this has been doing to you.

81
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,500
Let us help.

82
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:05,350
Maybe together we can
find out who killed him.

83
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,780
I think i might already know.

84
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,740
So,tell us about the suspect.

85
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,660
Truth is,i don't know
anything about him.

86
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,530
He's my father.

Before we go down this
road, you need to be sure.

94
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:03,920
He's right.

95
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,560
Some rocks don't need looking under.

96
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:09,600
My mind is sending me signals.
I can't ignore them anymore.

97
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,680
Mixed signals.

98
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,490
That's what the subconscious
is all about, you know that.

99
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,940
Reid,your dad left you.

100
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:18,440
You take it to the freudian extreme, you
could say that he killed your childhood.

101
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,650
Could explain a dream in which
you see him as a murderer.

102
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,910
I've come this far, i'm not going back.

103
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,140
Ok,thank you.

104
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,290
Emily,you rember agent Todd?

105
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,130
Oh,yeah. Welcome back. Thanks.

106
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,470
I'll be shadowing J.J. For
the next couple of weeks.

107
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,980
Big shoes to fill.

108
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,770
Big ankles, at least.

109
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,140
Come on,you look great.

110
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,700
That's what i keep telling her.

111
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,890
Do you have
kids, too?Or--

112
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,990
ah,no. I think J.J. May have
snared the last viable donor.

113
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,560
Tell me about it.

114
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:47,930
Donor for what?

115
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:48,500
Nothing.

116
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:51,780
I'm just,uh, reacquainting
agent Todd here with the layout.

117
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,540
Good to see you again,
S. S. A. Hotchner.

118
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,820
No,please. "Hotch."

119
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:57,110
Hotch. So,where's the rest of the team?

120
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,000
Oh,another case came up while we were in las
vegas,and they stayed behind to look into it.

121
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,970
Excuse me.

122
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:06,180
I thought you work cases together.

123
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,110
This one's different.

124
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,350
Riley was 6 at the time.

125
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:12,800
His father, lou jenkins, was supposed
to pick him up from t-ball practice at 4.

126
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,680
But he got delayed at work, prompting
riley to walk the 3 blocks home.

127
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,680
When his mother got home in the early
evening, she found him dead in the basement.

128
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,030
So,the offender came to the
house after the boy arrived home.

129
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,610
Or picked him up on the way there.

130
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:26,300
Coaxes riley into the basement
where he sexually assaults him.

131
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,160
The boy's mouth was taped shut.

132
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,060
Symbolic.

133
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:32,000
The unsub fears riley will talk,
panics,weighs his options...

134
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,870
Decides to make certain
that he'll never talk.

135
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,560
He finds a knife in the
fishing gear under the stairs,

136
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:42,340
Stabs riley 9 times in the chest,
stuffs him behind the washing machine.

137
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,930
So,the unsub's a white male
in his late 20s to early 30s.

138
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,690
Means we're looking
for a man in his 50s.

139
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:49,980
Likely knew the boy.

140
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,210
Maybe been to his house.

141
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,380
Neighbor.

142
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,880
Reid? What is it?

143
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:59,430
My family lived less than a
half mile from the jenkins'.

144
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,110
Do you think your dad knew the boy?

145
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,330
I don't know.

146
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:07,560
My memory's lack of recall just
reinforces how little i knew about him.

147
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,770
Reid,we're going to
have to track him down.

148
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,610
You do know that?

149
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,530
We should talk to my
mother first, neighbors.

150
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,200
Get their impressions.

151
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:20,900
Reid,i don't need to tell you that this
signature was need-based and sexual in nature.

152
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:24,390
The man we're looking
for is a pedophile.

153
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,380
So,i'll ask you again.

154
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,500
Are you sure you want
to go down this road?

155
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:40,530
Mom? Can i ask you some
questions about dad?

156
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:44,660
I'm having... Having
trouble remembering.

157
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,720
What do you want to know?

158
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,780
Did he like to be around children?

159
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,870
Children?

160
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,960
Well,yes.

161
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,710
If it were up to him, you'd have a
house full of brothers and sisters.

162
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,600
So,you didn't want more kids?

163
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,150
Why mess with perfection?

164
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:08,460
Um, what about other people's children?

165
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,410
How was he around them?

166
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,630
He was good with kids,i guess.

167
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,360
He coached your little league team.

168
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:18,210
Good hit. Yeah!

169
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,660
Hey,good hit, riley.

170
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:23,430
Spencer, you're next.

171
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,740
He was always trying to put
you into normal activities.

172
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,990
I tried to tell him you're not normal.

173
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,110
You were exceptional.

174
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,890
Let me ask you this,mom.

175
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:39,260
Did you ever get the feeling,
like,on his part, the marriage was...

176
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,780
Just for show?

177
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,180
These questions are
very strange, spencer.

178
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,890
What is this about?

179
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,410
It's about riley jenkins.

180
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,340
Riley jenkins?

181
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,060
I told you, he was someone you made up.

182
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,610
No,he's not someone i made up.

183
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:56,040
He was a real boy who lived in our
neighborhood, and somebody killed him.

184
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:02,150
And,i don't know,i think-- i think that
dad might have had something to do with it.

185
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,840
He was real?

186
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,060
Yes. And...

187
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:10,880
He was on that little league team,too.

188
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:14,610
So many cases. How do you
determine which ones get priority?

189
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,230
Ah,basically murder triage.

190
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:21,910
I look for cases where the threat of
losing another life is most imminent.

191
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,500
Without the other agents
giving you a working profile?

192
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,810
Well,that comes later.

193
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,420
This job does require a
little bit of profiling.

194
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,050
Just don't tell them that.

195
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,190
Here, let me show you.

196
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:39,440
Ok,family in atlanta,mother, twin
daughters, stabbed in their sleep,and,uh...

197
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,840
Yeah,sioux city, iowa.

198
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:46,600
Two men with no apparent connection both found
drowned in their bathtub exactly one month apart.

199
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:47,470
Where would you go?

200
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,710
I'd have to take a closer look.

201
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,050
What does your gut tell you?

202
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,870
Sioux city looks like a serial.

203
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,290
Another victim could die within a month.

204
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,140
What about atlanta?

205
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,680
That's a family annihilator.

206
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:04,770
Father snaps, takes out the flock, puts any
relative in the area in immediate danger.

207
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,180
I'd take the team there first.

208
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:11,370
Good. Now, do that with that
whole entire stack, right there.

209
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:16,170
You ok?

210
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,360
Oh,yeah. I'm fine.

211
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,950
It's just a theory, mr. Jenkins.

212
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,640
You must be out of your damn minds.

213
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,350
We're trying to get some new facts.

214
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:28,030
Well,you're hell and gone from facts
if you think will Reid killed my son.

215
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:30,090
So,you were friends?

216
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,030
Who the hell are you to
come here,asking this?

217
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,880
I'm his son.

218
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,750
Spencer?

219
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:43,720
Spencer, a g-man? How about that?

220
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,890
I don't understand.

221
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,980
Was william around your house often?

222
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:50,410
The occasional barbecue,
that sort of thing.

223
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,790
Was riley around on these occasions?

224
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:55,360
Why are you doing this?

225
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,320
I need to know.

226
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:00,660
Take it from someone who
does know, he was a good man.

227
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:03,460
Thanks for your time.

228
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:07,610
Where is he, these days? My dad?

229
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:12,340
It's been years, but he's probably
still at that same firm in summerlin.

230
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,650
He's been in town this whole time?

231
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,870
Far as i know.

232
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,420
You know summerlin?

233
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:26,390
Yeah. It's like 9 miles
east of here. Off the 95.

234
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,560
He was 10 minutes away
and never let me know.

235
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:34,190
Can i help you,gentlemen?

236
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:37,020
Yeah.

237
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:41,230
We'd like to speak with william Reid.

238
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,510
Is he expecting you?

239
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,940
I don't think so.

240
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:44,870
He's in a meeting right now.

241
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:47,970
Why don't you have a seat
and i'll tell him you're here.

242
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,110
You ok?

243
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,580
Yeah. No--yeah--i'm going
to go to the bathroom.

244
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,130
I've never seen him like this before.

245
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:06,030
17 years is a long time
to go between visits.

246
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,570
Not long enough. The kid's still angry.

247
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,100
Yeah,i'm starting to get that.

248
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:13,260
I'll be right back. Here you go.

249
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,710
You from the fbi?

250
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,620
Yes,sir. Mr. Reid, i'm agent
Rossi. This is agent Morgan.

251
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:23,460
This wouldn't be about the city
council investigation,would it?

252
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:26,870
No,this is, uh,more
of a personal matter.

253
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,040
It concerns your son.

254
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,010
My son? Did something happen?

255
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:33,440
That's what we're trying to find out.

256
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:38,750
Hello,dad.

257
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,150
You don't look like me anymore.

258
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,450
You used to. Everybody said so.

259
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:51,230
They say some people
look like their dogs,too.

260
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,500
It's attributed to
prolonged mutual exposure.

261
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,520
Elderly couples,also.

262
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:57,610
They unconsciously mimic the expressions of
people they've been around their whole life.

263
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,560
So,it kind of-- kind of makes sense
that i wouldn't really look like you.

264
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,360
I haven't seen you in 20 years.

265
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,120
So,are you in town on work?

266
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,700
We're just wrapping up a case.

267
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,810
A 5-year-old boy was
abducted and murdered.

268
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,680
I read about that.
Uh,ethan hayes, right?

269
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:15,290
That's terrible.

270
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:20,220
That case got me thinking
about riley jenkins.

271
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,110
You remember riley jenkins?

272
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,250
Of course.

273
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,690
I've been having dreams about
him for a really long time.

274
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:30,400
But when we came back here for this case,
it jogged something and the dream changed.

275
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:34,180
I saw his killer and he was you.

276
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,790
Interesting dream.

277
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,350
You don't seem all that surprised.

278
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:41,120
I stopped being surprised by
spencer's mind a long time ago.

279
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:44,480
There are certain criteria we consider
when looking at this type of suspect.

280
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:47,500
You fit parts of that profile.

281
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,490
Me?

282
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,420
We just want your cooperation.

283
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,900
My cooperat...

284
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:58,860
You're not actually saying you
think i killed riley jenkins?

285
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,820
We didn't say that.

286
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,580
Good,'cause that's absurd.

287
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,520
We'd just like permission to look through
your computer, access your records.

288
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:08,330
And what would you be
looking for exactly?

289
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:12,310
You want access to my files?

290
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:15,040
Get a warrant.

291
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:18,280
We can't get a warrant, so we have to
go under the radar on this one,garcia.

292
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,790
You want me to hack
your father's network?

293
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,690
You sure about this?

294
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,810
I really wish people
would stop asking me that.

295
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,530
<i>You're.........</i>

296
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,800
Hey,you're pretty good.

297
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,760
Was the envelope dropped
off at the front desk first?

298
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,430
Nope,it went straight to my room.

299
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,010
So,they knew what room you were in.

300
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,350
I do have to admit, the timing
of this is a little suspicious.

301
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:56,370
Yeah. An hour after i see my
father, we're handed another suspect.

302
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,720
You think you knew this guy?

303
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,910
I don't know. I think
so,but i'm not sure.

304
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,980
I--i--no, i
don't know.

305
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,900
Exposed himself to a minor.

306
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,870
That's a precursor to molestation.

307
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,100
And murder.

308
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:08,710
We should take a
closer look at this guy.

309
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:10,890
it's garcia.

310
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,110
Yeah,talk to me, baby girl.

311
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,590
I'm not interrupting boy
time at crazy horse 2,am i?

312
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,590
You know that's not my thing.

313
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,970
I'm more for in-room entertainment.

314
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,740
I can't help you but
i do give good phone.

315
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,010
Let me hear what you got.

316
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,290
Reid,we've been all up
in your father's business.

317
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,050
What did you find?

318
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,130
Well,let me tell you
first what i did not find.

319
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:30,910
No kiddie porn, no membership to illicit
websites, no dubious emails, no chat room history.

320
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,190
What about his finances?

321
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,360
We went back 10 years.

322
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,730
No questionable transactions
that we can find.

323
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,500
Well,he did buy a ticket to
see celine dion 6 months ago.

324
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,810
But i think we can overlook that.

325
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,290
He's smart. Is it possible he
kept things under the table?

326
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:46,490
Well,of course. But from what we can
tell,Reid, he doesn't fit the profile.

327
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,360
We can tell you other things
about him, if you want to know.

328
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:51,570
I'm listening.

329
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,260
He's a workaholic, he actually
logs more hours than we do.

330
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:56,430
He makes decent money,but
he doesn't spend a lot of it.

331
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,830
He has a modest house.
He drives a hybrid.

332
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,340
He doesn't travel much. He
stays away from the casinos.

333
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:05,870
Um,and according to his veterinary
bills, he has a very sick cat.

334
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,590
He appears to spend most of his free time
alone, he goes to the movies a lot,and he reads.

335
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,910
And from his collection of first
editions, it seems his favorite author is--

336
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,730
Isaac asimov, i remember that one.

337
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,830
He does have one other major interest.

338
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:23,200
On his home computer, he's archived, like,a
ka-jillion things on one common subject.

339
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,300
What?

340
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,810
You,kiddo.

341
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,350
He's got,like, everything
that's been published online.

342
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,060
Every article you've been quoted in, pieces
you've written for behavioral science journals,

343
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:34,060
He even has a copy of your dissertation.

344
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,260
He's keeping tabs on you.

345
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,370
That's saying something.

346
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,580
Yeah,he googled me.

347
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:41,030
That makes up for everything.
I'm going to get some air.

348
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,580
You guys still there?

349
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:46,170
I thought we were giving him good news.

350
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,310
What else can we do?

351
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,380
Yeah,look up a name
for us, if you would.

352
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,780
Gary Brendan Michaels.

353
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,590
You like this gary guy
for the riley murder?

354
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,990
Somebody does.

355
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,740
wow,looks like you got a loose one.

356
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,500
No such thing.

357
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:13,190
These machines run on
random number generators.

358
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,310
No brains,no bias.

359
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,690
Best odds in the house,though.

360
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:19,170
Really? I thought that
craps had the best odds.

361
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:22,390
Normally,video poker odds are slightly
worse at . 7 percent in your favor.

362
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,630
But if you employ optimal strategy
and always drop with a royal flush,

363
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:28,710
You can push those odds to 2 percent.

364
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,530
Smart and handsome.

365
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,370
So,are you in town for the convention?

366
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:37,370
Um,there are 12 conventions in town this
week. Which one are you talking about?

367
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,280
Take your pick.

368
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,960
6 minutes.

369
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,300
Excuse me?

370
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:51,210
Um,it was something i used to say to my
mom to try to get her to quit smoking.

371
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,130
A cigarette takes 6
minutes off your life.

372
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:58,320
So every time she'd light one,i'd say, "it's
6 minutes less that i get to spend with you."

373
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,980
- Did it work?
- No.

374
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:03,210
Because i've tried it all--the
gum, the patch. Nothing works.

375
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:07,650
You should try hypnosis. They've had--
there's been a lot of success in...

376
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:12,140
Tell you what, i'll put mine
out if you buy me a drink.

377
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,760
Uh,not today, sweetheart.

378
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:16,730
We've been looking all over
the place for you. Come on.

379
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,910
Hey,you won,like, $2,000 here.

380
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,570
Keep it.

381
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:25,800
You do realize you just
gave two grand to a hooker?

382
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,520
Must have been quite a conversation.

383
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:28,940
What was it about?

384
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,510
How to stop smoking.

385
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:36,330
Thank you for seeing
us on such short notice.

386
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:39,780
Well,i'm always happy to assist the fbi.

387
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,000
Is there a witness
you want me to look at?

388
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:44,190
Uh,yeah. Me.

389
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,160
I'm trying to recover
memories from my childhood.

390
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:49,040
There was a murder.

391
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:50,870
How long ago are we talking about?

392
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,850
I was 4.

393
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,530
Memories from that age can
be difficult to interpret.

394
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,910
I'm aware of the
limitations of hypnotherapy.

395
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,700
Well,then you're aware
of suggestion issues.

396
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:04,680
If you've looked into this
case, you may have a bias.

397
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:07,910
Are you saying what he remembers
under hypnosis may not be real?

398
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,250
It's a possibility.

399
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,270
Either way,it's a tough sell in court.

400
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,310
We won't be using this
for evidentiary purposes.

401
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,360
It's really just for me.

402
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:20,050
The suppressed memories
are about my father.

403
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,630
I'd like to monitor this session.

404
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,040
Make sure you get him
to the right place.

405
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:26,500
You want to sit in?

406
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,140
I don't normally allow that.

407
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:33,960
In case you haven't realized,nothing
about this is normal.

408
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:37,960
I want you to hold my
wrist in your left hand.

409
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:42,930
And if you should feel any fear, i
want you to squeeze, do you understand?

410
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,120
Yes.

411
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:49,300
Go back to the night you
were just telling me about.

412
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:52,710
You're at home, in your room.

413
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,420
You can't sleep because
your parents are arguing.

414
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:01,020
i don't know what to do. I had to do
something,but i didn't know what to do.

415
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,900
i'm not going to discuss it anymore.

416
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,180
- He's coming in.
- Who?

417
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:15,680
I know you're awake, spencer.

418
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:16,600
It's dad.

419
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,790
What about him, spencer?

420
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,390
What is he doing?

421
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,310
Daddy loves you, you know that?

422
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,520
I don't want to be here.

423
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:32,590
Ok. It's ok,spencer.

424
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,510
Take us to where the light is.

425
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,680
To the next morning.

426
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:39,800
The sun is coming up.

427
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:42,510
Where are you,spencer?

428
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:53,650
Mom? My mom. She's at the window.

429
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:57,220
She's thinking.

430
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:01,560
She's been crying.

431
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,760
She saw him.

432
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:12,650
Who? Your father?

433
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,230
Do you talk to her?

434
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:26,340
No. No,i wanna--
I wanna see...

435
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:36,500
What is it,spencer?

436
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,680
What are you seeing?

437
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:38,400
That's enough.

438
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:41,140
I need you to leave this
location now,spencer.

439
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,810
Damn it. Wake him up.

440
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,010
I'm going to count backward from 5.

441
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:57,410
5,4,3,2,1, and wake.

442
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:03,810
Reid. It's ok. It's ok. It's
ok. It's ok,Reid. It's ok.

443
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:08,360
What happened? What did you see?

444
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,580
Try to rember, mom.

445
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,190
No,i can't.

446
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,580
You were there.

447
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:21,480
You watched dad burn the bloody clothes.

448
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,740
You had a dream.

449
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,780
Mom,this was not a
dream. This was a memory.

450
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:27,000
It was a memory and i saw you.

451
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:31,110
Your mind, ah,such a treasure.

452
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:34,140
Even as a baby you knew about
things you weren't supposed to know.

453
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:37,000
This is not about me. This
is about riley jenkins.

454
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:39,390
It was always about you.

455
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,060
Please,mom. Please.
Please,just try to rember.

456
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:47,310
Remember riley.

457
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:50,990
Riley?

458
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,770
Riley was real.

459
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,460
Oh,poor riley.

460
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:59,040
Yes,poor riley. Poor riley.
Did dad do something to him?

461
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:01,180
- Dad? No.
- Think. Think.

462
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,990
- Think. - No,no.
That's--no,no.

463
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,700
Now you're confusing me,spencer.

464
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,670
You knew. You knew about
dad,and you didn't do anything.

465
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:11,950
No! You don't know. No! No!
You don't know! You don't-- no!

466
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,180
No! No! No,no,no,no, no,no,no,no!

467
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:18,890
No,no,no,no!

468
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,770
I'm just going to give
you something to relax.

469
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,680
No.

470
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:38,110
It could have been you.

471
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,410
What? What did you say?

472
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:46,060
It could have been you.

473
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:48,060
She's not stable,Reid.

474
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:50,180
You can't put stock in what she
says. I don't need to tell you that.

475
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:52,020
And i don't need to tell
you this is textbook.

476
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,730
Father reroutes compulsion to molest
away from his own son to a surrogate.

477
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:58,020
The woman thought riley jenkins was an
imaginary friend until you told her otherwise.

478
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:59,880
The mind's way of suppressing
memories she doesn't want to face.

479
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:01,430
You're losing objectivity here,kid.

480
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,220
I'm not trying to say
i know what happened.

481
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:05,470
Or how my dad's involved,Morgan.

482
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,030
But my dad's involved.

483
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,870
What's he doing here?

484
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,820
You got no evidence.

485
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:32,740
A suspect can be detained for questioning
for 48 hours, regardless of evidence.

486
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:36,060
I'm not in the habit of ruining
people's reputations on a whim.

487
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,480
Where's your captain? I
want to talk to your captain.

488
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:38,960
Talk all you want.

489
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:43,390
This is a local murder, and your
authority ends at the state line.

490
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:47,240
Look...

491
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:51,460
Why don't you just head back
over to the fountain view

492
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:54,060
And have a couple of drinks by
the pool and think about this.

493
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,410
I have thought about this.

494
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,450
The guy's your father.

495
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,710
What's your point, detective?

496
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,120
Maybe you're here to work
out some other issues?

497
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:03,840
Ok,listen,detective.

498
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:09,470
If you helped us out with this.

499
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,530
We just want him on his heels.

500
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,130
You've got 24 hours.

501
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,630
I appreciate that.

502
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,230
Reid.

503
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,920
You gotta keep your head,man.

504
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,840
He just agreed to it.
It happens all the time.

505
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:28,270
You know how these guys are.

506
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,530
They just want to feel like
they're the ones in control.

507
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:35,590
Talk to me,garcia.

508
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,900
So,this gary michaels you asked me to track down
seems to have peeled himself right off the grid.

509
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:41,950
What did he do? Skip town?

510
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,780
Feels it. Maybe he took a new name,too.

511
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:48,150
Everything in his name laps from non-use
in the year after the riley jenkins murder.

512
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:50,240
Maybe he didn't want to stick
around for the investigation.

513
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:56,800
In addition to the indecent exposure wrap,
he also had some lewd behavior,trespassing.

514
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:57,590
Trespassing?

515
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,600
At a nursery school.

516
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:01,090
Hard to believe the cops never
pegged this guy as a suspect.

517
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,550
Any other avenues to find him?

518
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,510
You betcha. They swabbed him
in '85 for the exposure beef,

519
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,480
So i'm sending up balloons
through vicap and codis.

520
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:10,320
If he's offended again over the past
20 years under a different name...

521
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:12,570
Which,considering his
type, he probably has...

522
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,760
He will pop up somewhere.

523
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:16,160
All right. Keep me in the loop.

524
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:17,960
Later.

525
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,270
What's with the wincing? You ok?

526
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,090
Fine.

527
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,350
Are you sure? I noticed this earlier.

528
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,780
Earlier? How often?

529
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:34,620
Um,in the last hour.
I'd say every 10 minutes.

530
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,740
J.J. Why didn't you tell anyone?

531
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:38,130
Because i am not due
for another 3 weeks.

532
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:39,950
Newsflash! You're in labor.

533
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,190
No,no,no. Because Reid
needs us right now.

534
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,350
You need you, right now. Come on,get up.

535
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,780
Ladies and gentlemen, i'm not a doctor.

536
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:51,880
I don't even play one on tv,but i
believe young J.J.'s going into labor.

537
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,760
Are you ok?

538
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:54,860
I'll get the car.

539
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,740
- I need to call will.
- From the car,honey.

540
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:59,050
Breathe and walk. Breathe and walk.

541
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:03,030
Agent Todd, i hope you're ready
because your job starts right now.

542
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:16,490
You still think ********

543
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,680
why shouldn't i?

544
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:20,320
Well,for one thing, gary
michaels fits the profile.

545
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:22,770
For another, he fled
town after riley's murder.

546
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,630
He's a better suspect
than your dad,Reid.

547
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,980
He's a convenient one.

548
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:29,540
Someone slipped the file under my
door,Morgan. What am i supposed to think?

549
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:32,250
Maybe they're trying to help.

550
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,610
Maybe they're trying to protect him.

551
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:38,460
You're talking about someone helping
to cover up the murder of a child.

552
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:40,820
Who would do that?

553
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:45,370
Do you rember how resistant detective hyde
was when i asked him to bring in my father?

554
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,330
So,what? You're accusing a cop now?

555
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,420
It was a police file.

556
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:51,410
It was a very old police file.
Anybody could have accessed it.

557
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:55,860
He told me to go back to the fountain view,
have a drink by the pool,and think about things.

558
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:58,580
You can't possibly
still be mad about that.

559
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,200
I'm not mad. I'm confused.

560
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:03,580
I never told him we were
staying at the fountain view.

561
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,830
CODIS REPORT MATCH CONFIMED

562
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,750
It's a simple question.

563
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,240
How did the blood get on the clothes?

564
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,670
I told you,i'm not going
to talk without council.

565
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:35,760
If you don't have anything to
hide,you don't need a lawyer.

566
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:38,990
Spencer,please. I'm not stupid.

567
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:42,600
I'm proud of you, you know that?

568
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:43,900
I'm not stupid either.

569
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:48,090
No. You've done a lot of good.

570
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:51,630
I mean,other people with your talents, they
might have sought different opportunities.

571
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,130
The private sector.

572
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:56,170
My god,you could have made a fortune.

573
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,750
But you chose to help people.

574
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,210
I chose to study murders.

575
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,690
Why do you think that is?

576
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,610
I didn't do this,spencer.

577
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,790
Why can't you believe me?

578
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,340
Like you said, i do
have special talents.

579
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:11,410
One of them is being able to tell
when somebody is hiding something.

580
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,750
You're angry that i left.

581
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,650
And you're right to be.

582
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,940
You want to make it up to me?

583
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:19,480
Tell me the truth.

584
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,450
I didn't kill that boy.

585
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,970
But i know who did.

586
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:31,010
Gary michaels?

587
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,400
How'd you know that?

588
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:34,520
That was the whole idea,wasn't it?

589
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:36,560
So,where is gary michaels now,dad?

590
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:39,580
Spencer,please. Forget it.

591
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,400
You don't want to go down this road.

592
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,720
Everything's fine. We're
checking her in now.

593
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:49,030
And i got a thing back from
california on your codis query.

594
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,040
Did they find gary michaels?

595
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:52,110
Some of him.

596
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,260
He's dead?

597
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:56,550
They dug him up 7 years ago when some new
construction broke ground in the desert.

598
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,560
Whoever killed him was smart enough
to bury him across state lines.

599
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:01,270
Vegas P. D.never made the connect.

600
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,420
How was he killed?

601
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:04,960
Judging from the fractures, they
think he was beaten with something.

602
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,130
- A pipe,maybe.
- Or a bat.

603
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,280
Bat?

604
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:20,110
Maybe it wasn't riley's blood on
those clothes your dad was burning.

605
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:30,570
{\a6}<i>Sheriff's......</i>

606
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,940
Been rumors a body was buried
up at the barker ranch for years.

607
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,620
On account of that's where
chuck manson had his hideout.

608
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:37,110
When we dug this one up, we
went ahead and had him typed.

609
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,850
Thought maybe it could be related.

610
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,230
It's a good thing you did.

611
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,710
Might never have I. D.'d him otherwise.

612
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,140
So,why all the fuss over a dead pervert?

613
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:46,880
We think he may have killed a
boy in vegas over 20 years ago.

614
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:49,010
Is that how he ended up
in the ground? Revenge?

615
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:49,980
Possibly.

616
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:54,450
It says here you have a fingerprint in evidence,
lifted from the victim's broken glasses.

617
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:57,000
We ran it up the flagpole
a couple of times.

618
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:58,120
Nothing ever came up.

619
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:00,580
That was then. Now we have
someone to compare it to.

620
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:01,570
A suspect?

621
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,680
Well,we're going to want
to run it through afis,too.

622
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:08,990
That's a lot of taxpayer dollars being
spent to solve a public service murder.

623
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,460
If you ask me, the guy
got just what he deserved.

624
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,300
He's right,you know.

625
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,480
We don't have to run this print.

626
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,350
Of course we do. Whatever michaels
did, he deserved a fair trial.

627
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,940
Reid,you wanted to know if
your father killed riley.

628
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:24,100
All signs point to "no."
you got what you need.

629
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,750
What i need is the truth.

630
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:30,330
If this print belongs to your dad,
he could go away for a long time.

631
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:33,230
You're just determined
to nail him,aren't you?

632
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,640
Doesn't even matter what for.

633
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:37,450
If you don't want to run it,i will.

634
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,960
I'm told you're refusing medication.

635
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:53,570
I'm just holding off for a
little while, if you don't mind.

636
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,580
You know what will happen.

637
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:59,030
Tremors,panic, then the voices.

638
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:03,910
But before that, when the fog
lifts, a window of clarity.

639
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,940
I really need that right now.

640
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:09,520
I can give you some latitude here.

641
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:12,990
Just tell me why.

642
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,930
I want to remember.

643
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:39,730
Yeah,agent Morgan.

644
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:42,800
You did?

645
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:45,660
You're 100 percent certain?

646
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,310
Ok. Thank you.

647
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,770
We're going to have to
get an arrest warrant.

648
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,070
It was a match?

649
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,750
Yeah. But it wasn't your dad.

650
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:22,690
- We got company.
- What's he doing here?

651
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:25,690
We notified your captain
about this,detective.

652
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,020
It's all legit.

653
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,140
I'm not trying to stop you.

654
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:31,060
I just want to be the
one to bring him in.

655
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:33,990
It'll go easier.

656
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,210
He's my friend.

657
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,200
Yeah,we figured that
much. You,lou,my father.

658
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:42,230
You slipped us the
michaels file,didn't you?

659
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,430
You were after the wrong guy.

660
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,510
But you knew who the
right guy was all along?

661
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,070
And what lou did to him.

662
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,230
There wasn't any evidence.

663
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,070
Did you even look?

664
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,780
You want to link him up,go ahead.

665
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:55,400
But he rides in with us.

666
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:58,160
Appreciate that.

667
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:13,150
Who else was with you?

668
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,150
No one.

669
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:17,240
You're saying you killed gary
michaels by yourself,all alone.

670
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:17,980
That's right.

671
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:20,600
And william Reid wasn't a party to this?

672
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:21,190
No.

673
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,340
You're lying.

674
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:23,520
I'm not lying.

675
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:26,040
He was burning bloody
clothes. I saw him.

676
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:27,950
What makes you think gary
michaels killed your boy?

677
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,000
He admitted it.

678
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:31,920
You beat a guy with a baseball bat,
he's going to admit to a lot of things.

679
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:34,140
How do you know he was the right guy?

680
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:36,300
I know.

681
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:39,560
He approached another
kid in the neighborhood.

682
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:40,930
Hey,you're pretty good.

683
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:43,470
And how do you know that?

684
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:47,820
- I was told by a concerned party.
- Who? Another parent?

685
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:50,370
Mind if i play?

686
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,060
That's all i'm going
to say on the subject.

687
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:55,030
Who was it?

688
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,980
I told you that's all i'm
going to say on the sub--

689
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:58,940
- Who was it?
- Agent Reid?

690
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:00,720
Do not interfere with this
interrogation,detective.

691
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:04,050
This is not your case anymore.

692
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:07,640
Spencer,it was me.

693
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:15,280
I'd seen him around at your
ball games, at the park.

694
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:18,470
You used to play chess
there,do you remember?

695
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,280
You played with him once.

696
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:21,480
With gary michaels?

697
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:23,010
I didn't know that
was his name back then,

698
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:26,420
But it wasn't unusual for
you to play with adults.

699
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:29,380
And you'd win,too.

700
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:31,020
Did he do something to me?

701
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:34,190
Oh,no. God,no. It
never got to that point.

702
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:38,670
But when i saw the way he looked
at you, i knew what he was.

703
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,610
I could just tell.

704
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,500
A mother knows.

705
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,970
Yes.

706
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:49,620
So,you told riley's dad.

707
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:52,480
2 nights later, lou called the house.

708
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:54,490
He was agitated.

709
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:57,260
He said he needed me to meet him.

710
00:35:58,770 --> 00:35:59,900
Is that him?

711
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,780
Yes.

712
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,530
His name is gary michaels.

713
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,670
He has a history.

714
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,910
History?

715
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:12,630
He's done things to kids.

716
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,860
How do you know?

717
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,720
You should go now.

718
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:22,130
What are you going to do?

719
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,660
Go home,diana.

720
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:38,050
I sat there. I couldn't
move. It was like a dream.

721
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:42,050
That paralysis in the
face of something terrible.

722
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:44,950
What happened after that?

723
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:48,610
It's ok,diana.

724
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:51,810
Go on.

725
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:55,630
At some point,i found myself
walking towards the house.

726
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:12,010
Oh,my god. Lou,what did you do?

727
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,030
And the rest...

728
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,150
It's all dark after that.

729
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,330
You came home.

730
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,520
She couldn't talk at first.

731
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:32,200
But eventually i came to
understand what had happened.

732
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:36,160
And i knew that nobody could ever know.

733
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,750
So,you never told anyone?

734
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,610
No,she could have been implicated.

735
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:45,450
And i had to protect her.

736
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:53,550
You were burning her bloody clothes.

737
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,280
But the knowing, you
can't burn that away.

738
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:04,120
It changes everything.

739
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:05,420
Is that why you left?

740
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:06,870
I tried to keep us together, spencer.

741
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:12,780
I swear to you, but the weight
of that knowledge,it was too much.

742
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:22,280
You could have come back.

743
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:23,840
Could have started over.

744
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:26,880
I didn't know how to
take care of you anymore.

745
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:30,420
When i lost that confidence,
there was no going back.

746
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:34,360
What's done is done.

747
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:41,820
At least now you know the truth.

748
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:45,000
I was wrong about everything. I'm sorry.

749
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:57,070
I am,too,spencer.

750
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:04,910
"there is no refuge from memory
and remorse in this world.

751
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:09,690
"the spirits of our foolish deeds
haunt us with or without repentance."

752
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,150
Gilbert parker.

753
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,400
Well,he looks just like you.

754
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:16,000
Let's hope he grows out of that.

755
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:18,870
Just as long as he
doesn't inherit the accent.

756
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:21,430
Is there room for one more in here?

757
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,720
Spence,hi.

758
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:25,330
Welcome back.

759
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:28,610
Congratulations.

760
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,770
Thank you.

761
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:35,670
How is it that i just went through 15
hours of labor and you look worse than i do?

762
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,000
Don't be ridiculous. You look beautiful.

763
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:45,590
- Well,i could sure use some coffee. Anyone else?
- Sure.

764
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,110
My treat.

765
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:53,230
You ok?

766
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,780
Yeah,yeah. You?

767
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:59,530
Yeah,yeah,you sure? 'Cause there's something
i wanted to ask you, but it can wait.

768
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,770
What is it?

769
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:05,680
Will and i were talking,and,um...

770
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,060
We want you to be henry's godfather.

771
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:13,830
- I don't even know-- i don't know--
- here,do you want to hold him?

772
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:17,470
- It's ok. Here you go.
- Ok.

773
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,520
Watch his head. There you go.

774
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:21,740
Hello,henry.

775
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:26,900
If anything should happen to us, it's up to you
and garcia to make sure this boy gets into yale.

776
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:31,340
Yale. Yale? Do you want
to go to yale,henry?

777
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:34,940
That was your godfather's safety school.

778
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:39,290
Don't worry,i can get you into
cal-tech with one phone call.
