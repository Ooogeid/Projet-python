1
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,307
This is Dorris Archer,
she's the third woman to go missing

2
00:01:07,432 --> 00:01:09,574
In Boise, Idaho, this year, along

3
00:01:09,699 --> 00:01:12,074
with Paula Renmar and Samantha Rush.

4
00:01:12,199 --> 00:01:14,343
They went missing roughly
2 months apart.

5
00:01:15,678 --> 00:01:16,678
Hello.

6
00:01:22,193 --> 00:01:23,874
Did you join a boy band?

7
00:01:24,998 --> 00:01:25,710
No.

8
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:31,080
OK, so what are we looking at here?
Late 20s, early 30s.

9
00:01:31,361 --> 00:01:35,344
All single, though two are in committed
relationships. All living on their own.

10
00:01:35,673 --> 00:01:38,299
Looks like normal suburban houses.
Gives the unsub privacy.

11
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:41,384
The differences are more striking than
the similarities. Different hair colors,

12
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:43,584
- different body shapes.
- What about his M.O.?

13
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:46,513
That's why we were invited in.
The abduction sites are pristine.

14
00:01:46,638 --> 00:01:47,940
There's no DNA besides

15
00:01:48,065 --> 00:01:50,367
the victims, there's no sign
of forced entry or a struggle.

16
00:01:50,492 --> 00:01:53,023
The victims aren't reported missing
until 2 or 3 days

17
00:01:53,148 --> 00:01:55,197
- after they're abducted.
- 2 or 3 days...

18
00:01:55,988 --> 00:01:58,951
Women like this don't just vanish
without somebody noticing.

19
00:01:59,281 --> 00:02:00,605
Yes. Which is why

20
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,230
I asked Garcia
to dig into their lives.

21
00:02:03,476 --> 00:02:06,542
And when I took a look at their
online activity, I could easily see

22
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,086
- how the unsub is doing it.
- Social networking sites.

23
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:13,120
Facebook, Twitter. You name
an online life-sharing time suck,

24
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,167
The victims were on it.
If you look at each of their last posts,

25
00:02:16,292 --> 00:02:18,471
They say kind of the same thing,
going out of town,

26
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,723
going on a business trip,
going on a vacation.

27
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:23,373
But when you look at the time
and date stamp of each of these,

28
00:02:23,498 --> 00:02:26,264
cue the twilight zone music,
'cause they were all posted

29
00:02:26,389 --> 00:02:28,385
the morning after each of them
went missing.

30
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,916
- The unsub posted them.
- Social networks are an easy way

31
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:32,674
For an unsub to target his victims.

32
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:34,983
These women were especially open.
They posted everything

33
00:02:35,108 --> 00:02:37,725
they were having for dinner to
where they were going on dates.

34
00:02:37,836 --> 00:02:39,418
So this unsub friends his victims

35
00:02:39,543 --> 00:02:41,744
And then uses that
as a cover once he takes them.

36
00:02:42,032 --> 00:02:45,032
That means he can hack into their
accounts. He's excellent with computers.

37
00:02:45,157 --> 00:02:47,630
Definitely profiles as patient
and organized. He's obsessive enough

38
00:02:47,755 --> 00:02:49,317
to remove all forensic details,

39
00:02:49,442 --> 00:02:52,071
but also patient enough
to wait 2 months before abductions.

40
00:02:52,196 --> 00:02:54,153
He can afford to be.
He gets 3 days

41
00:02:54,278 --> 00:02:56,133
to do whatever he wants
to these women.

42
00:02:56,462 --> 00:02:59,053
That means we need to assume
these women are already dead.

43
00:03:00,141 --> 00:03:02,431
The question is what he does
while he has them.

44
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:56,237
Criminal Team
http://experts.heberg-forum.net/

45
00:04:01,384 --> 00:04:03,423
"The single biggest problem
with communication

46
00:04:03,548 --> 00:04:05,450
"is the illusion
that it has taken place.

47
00:04:05,575 --> 00:04:06,871
George Bernard Shaw.

48
00:04:10,114 --> 00:04:12,918
So if this unsub is using social
networks to find his victims,

49
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,712
can't we use that to find him?

50
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,478
If these women each had 100 friends
following them, then the unsub

51
00:04:18,603 --> 00:04:20,634
would pop up on each of their lists,
right?

52
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,177
The Detective in charge,

53
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:25,204
John Fordham, he looked into
their groups. Everyone checked out.

54
00:04:25,451 --> 00:04:27,290
Social networking sites are

55
00:04:27,415 --> 00:04:29,853
surprisingly insecure. Facebook recently
tried to update

56
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:33,403
all privacy settings, and in doing so,
they made everybody's profiles viewable.

57
00:04:33,661 --> 00:04:35,608
Can somebody explain to me

58
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,435
the appeal of these sites?

59
00:04:37,906 --> 00:04:39,820
"Eating Sushi tonight. Yum."

60
00:04:40,703 --> 00:04:42,865
"Boss is keeping me late at work."

61
00:04:44,441 --> 00:04:47,995
Whose life is so important that we'd be
interested in this kind of detail?

62
00:04:48,308 --> 00:04:50,136
I guess that's the running joke,
right?

63
00:04:50,261 --> 00:04:51,730
I mean, nobody is.

64
00:04:52,085 --> 00:04:54,557
But we'd all like to believe
there's actually an audience out there

65
00:04:54,682 --> 00:04:56,943
that wants to follow our every move.
Some sites actually

66
00:04:57,068 --> 00:04:58,505
have a GPS feature built in.

67
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,841
You can tell exactly where someone
is every time they post a new comment.

68
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,931
This is telling us how
he's finding them,

69
00:05:03,056 --> 00:05:04,505
But it's not telling us how
he's getting into their houses.

70
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,954
At the very least, I believe that
he has copies of their keys.

71
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:09,306
Dorris Archer
had a home security system installed,

72
00:05:09,431 --> 00:05:12,645
but the disable code was entered
at 1:56 A.M. So he knew that, too.

73
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,230
He also found a way to deal
with her dog. A German Shepherd

74
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:18,293
she adopted from the pound last year
went missing the night that she did.

75
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,449
So this guy's gotta be in
and out of the house

76
00:05:20,574 --> 00:05:22,511
well before the night
of the disappearance.

77
00:05:22,636 --> 00:05:25,218
He comes up with some ruse,
talks his way inside,

78
00:05:25,322 --> 00:05:28,175
then once he's familiar enough with
the house, he knows he can come back

79
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,698
and kidnap them
without disturbing anything.

80
00:05:29,823 --> 00:05:32,980
What about the people who come into your
house that you don't consider a threat?

81
00:05:33,393 --> 00:05:35,479
Home repair guys, dog-walkers.

82
00:05:35,604 --> 00:05:37,428
Detective Fordham
looked into that, too.

83
00:05:37,553 --> 00:05:39,795
No one even came close
to being a killer.

84
00:05:40,135 --> 00:05:42,549
Morgan and Prentiss,
start with the last abduction sites.

85
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:43,842
See if anything point to his M.O.

86
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:46,498
Dave, you, Reid, and JJ
go back over the women's lives.

87
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,959
Start with their friends
on the social networking sites.

88
00:05:49,084 --> 00:05:51,150
If this is how the unsub
is finding them, Maybe

89
00:05:51,275 --> 00:05:53,482
they're connected to him
without even realizing it.

90
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,775
Detective Fordham.

91
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:01,431
- Agent Jareau?
- Yeah.

92
00:06:01,556 --> 00:06:04,905
These are SSA Hotcher, Rossi,
and Dr. Spencer Reid.

93
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,032
Thank you for coming.
We can really use your help.

94
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,591
Did you find anyone willing
to talk to us about the victims?

95
00:06:09,716 --> 00:06:12,469
The problem wasn't who to bring in.
It was who not to.

96
00:06:19,849 --> 00:06:21,213
The man we're looking for

97
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,091
might have found your daughter
through her social networks.

98
00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:27,428
Did Paula mention
anyone new in her life?

99
00:06:27,871 --> 00:06:30,264
- No.
- No one who started following her

100
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:33,532
as a friend,
someone she didn't recognize?

101
00:06:33,807 --> 00:06:36,145
I don't really know how those work.

102
00:06:36,511 --> 00:06:38,046
Someone sent me an email

103
00:06:38,171 --> 00:06:40,811
Congratulating me
on Paula's promotion.

104
00:06:41,917 --> 00:06:43,068
I didn't even know.

105
00:06:43,588 --> 00:06:44,778
And when I asked her,

106
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:47,740
she said,
"Mom, I put that on my wall last week."

107
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:51,243
She was gone 2 days later.

108
00:06:54,271 --> 00:06:57,271
Samantha was rigorous
about keeping her status updated.

109
00:06:58,454 --> 00:07:00,085
She's obsessed with those sites.

110
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,963
So I'm assuming she knew
who followed her, then?

111
00:07:03,286 --> 00:07:06,008
God, no.
She had over 1,000 friends.

112
00:07:06,686 --> 00:07:09,011
- Why so many?
- We both worked in real estate.

113
00:07:09,453 --> 00:07:11,597
She saw it as the perfect way
to promote herself.

114
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,824
Even though she told
all those people

115
00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:16,426
what she was doing,
she didn't know who was following her?

116
00:07:18,403 --> 00:07:21,148
You ever have so much email,
you feeling like you're drowning in it?

117
00:07:21,777 --> 00:07:23,358
Actually, I don't have email.

118
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,402
Seriously?

119
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,198
Then let me break it down for you.

120
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,547
These websites are like email
on crack.

121
00:07:33,106 --> 00:07:35,245
It's impossible to keep up
with everybody.

122
00:07:37,894 --> 00:07:40,905
We just have a few more questions
about your girlfriend's disappearance.

123
00:07:41,269 --> 00:07:43,202
Did Dorris ever mention

124
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:45,399
letting someone in her home?

125
00:07:45,891 --> 00:07:46,957
Like who?

126
00:07:47,789 --> 00:07:49,885
We're just trying to figure out
who would know

127
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:51,716
the code to her home security.

128
00:07:52,115 --> 00:07:54,765
It must have been someone
she trusted with the combination.

129
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,017
No.

130
00:07:57,142 --> 00:07:59,269
She was smart.
She took precautions.

131
00:08:01,088 --> 00:08:02,856
That's the whole reason
she got Bruno.

132
00:08:03,303 --> 00:08:05,651
- Bruno, the dog. So he was a guard dog?
- Yeah.

133
00:08:06,115 --> 00:08:07,694
She trained him for like 6 weeks.

134
00:08:12,403 --> 00:08:14,118
I know these are hard to look at,

135
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:17,442
but do you see anything different?

136
00:08:18,661 --> 00:08:21,500
Something he may have done
to get himself inside.

137
00:08:31,995 --> 00:08:33,053
This isn't right.

138
00:08:33,448 --> 00:08:35,180
- What's that?
- The photographs.

139
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,851
This is when we first started dating. The
one on the right should be on the left.

140
00:08:39,424 --> 00:08:41,556
. And she wouldn't have rearranged
them herself?

141
00:08:41,681 --> 00:08:42,563
No.

142
00:08:43,408 --> 00:08:46,232
She arranged them
a certain way to tell a story.

143
00:08:47,966 --> 00:08:50,252
It was how we fell in love.

144
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,200
OK, JJ, I got it.

145
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,243
You see it?

146
00:08:57,045 --> 00:08:58,036
Actually, yeah.

147
00:08:58,486 --> 00:09:00,541
Looks like he did try to hang something
on the wall.

148
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,833
There's even
a little residue left over.

149
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:05,986
<i>Let me call you back.</i>

150
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,818
- What do you got?
- I got one up here, too.

151
00:09:10,721 --> 00:09:12,259
What would he try to hang
on that part of the wall?

152
00:09:13,709 --> 00:09:14,709
From here,

153
00:09:15,303 --> 00:09:18,599
I have an unobstructed view
of the second floor and down the stairs.

154
00:09:20,179 --> 00:09:22,853
It's the same thing down here.
You can see the entire entrance.

155
00:09:23,238 --> 00:09:24,238
Cameras.

156
00:09:24,937 --> 00:09:26,064
He put up cameras.

157
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,929
We think this is what he's using
to spy on his victims.

158
00:10:04,487 --> 00:10:06,620
They're small, they're cheap,
and they're easily hidden,

159
00:10:06,745 --> 00:10:08,319
behind photos, books, or plants.

160
00:10:08,444 --> 00:10:10,897
The footage they record
can then be transmitted anywhere.

161
00:10:11,022 --> 00:10:13,100
Website of your choice,
even your cell phone.

162
00:10:13,225 --> 00:10:16,365
He can toggle between cameras to see
everything that's happening in the house.

163
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:18,200
You found 5 of these
at different points in the house?

164
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,452
Upstairs, downstairs,
bedroom, even the bath.

165
00:10:20,725 --> 00:10:23,151
A ruse gets him in the door,
but it doesn't buy him enough time

166
00:10:23,276 --> 00:10:25,037
- to put up 5 of these.
- Right. That's why we think

167
00:10:25,162 --> 00:10:27,065
he starts with one camera facing
the front door.

168
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:30,003
That tells him when it's safe to enter
the house, when she comes and goes,

169
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:33,048
when the dog-walker comes, and what
the combination to the house is.

170
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,392
It fits his M.O.

171
00:10:34,517 --> 00:10:36,888
It he learned their every detail
on social networks,

172
00:10:37,013 --> 00:10:38,971
he will be just as obsessive
in his surveillance.

173
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,491
And once he learns their routine,
all he has to do Is pick the lock,

174
00:10:41,616 --> 00:10:44,679
put up the rest of the cameras, he got
their whole life at his fingertips.

175
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,980
What does he do with the video?
Maybe he keeps them?

176
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,374
If he's a voyeur, yes.

177
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:52,339
Voyeurs are rarely violent.
Their excitement comes from spying

178
00:10:52,464 --> 00:10:54,945
without the object
knowing they're being watched.

179
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,504
And by abducting his victims,

180
00:10:56,505 --> 00:10:59,370
He's removing the outlet
of his sexual release. Reid is right.

181
00:10:59,775 --> 00:11:02,857
So he must have some other
agenda with these cameras.

182
00:11:02,977 --> 00:11:05,334
He might be sharing the
footage with other people.

183
00:11:05,494 --> 00:11:08,671
We need to have Garcia dig into
surveillance In illegal video websites.

184
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,751
I'm going to take
this with us. Why?

185
00:11:10,752 --> 00:11:13,492
We originally profiled there
wasn't any facial similarity

186
00:11:13,493 --> 00:11:16,222
Between the victims,
but I'm not so sure that's true.

187
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,889
I want to compare Dorris'
picture with the other victims.

188
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:23,682
These videos the unsub took,
it looks like

189
00:11:24,219 --> 00:11:27,059
One of them he posted online,
which may help me nab him.

190
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:30,857
If he puts it on the Web can't you track
that back directly to his computer?

191
00:11:30,977 --> 00:11:33,741
Normally, yes. Normally,
in like in 17 seconds

192
00:11:33,742 --> 00:11:36,536
I can get you the network he's using,
Get a physical address of his modem,

193
00:11:36,656 --> 00:11:38,290
And presto change-o,
no more bad guy,

194
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:42,264
But this unsub is a creepy
computer aficionado.

195
00:11:42,265 --> 00:11:43,950
Do you guys know what
a proxy server is?

196
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,337
It's an Internet relay.

197
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:47,806
Precisely. Kids use them to
get around blocked sites.

198
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,726
Now, usually one proxy is plenty,

199
00:11:49,727 --> 00:11:52,911
But this piece of work is
using dozens of proxy servers.

200
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:56,214
He's bounced his signal
off of China, north Korea,

201
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,754
Russia, South Africa...

202
00:11:57,755 --> 00:11:59,708
Garcia, can you trace
him back to Boise?

203
00:11:59,828 --> 00:12:01,586
Of course I can,
and that's what I'm doing?

204
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:04,012
Time is the unfortunate
ingredient I need, though.

205
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:06,479
This just in.

206
00:12:06,599 --> 00:12:08,998
Looks like one of the proxy
servers archived what

207
00:12:08,999 --> 00:12:11,730
he was streaming on the night of
Dorris archer's disappearance.

208
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,455
Can we see it?
Pulling it up now.

209
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:23,055
Well, Prentiss and Morgan were right.
He knows the house.

210
00:12:26,392 --> 00:12:27,875
And the dog knows him.

211
00:12:28,308 --> 00:12:29,702
please don't hurt that doggie.

212
00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:32,197
How many trips inside the
house would that take?

213
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:33,012
A dozen?

214
00:12:55,379 --> 00:12:58,114
See that? The camera's attached to him.
It's his point of view.

215
00:12:58,994 --> 00:13:01,283
So he can relive it
over and over again.

216
00:13:04,593 --> 00:13:06,334
Ok, can someone tell
me when this is over?

217
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:11,887
Please.

218
00:13:12,454 --> 00:13:13,324
Not yet.

219
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:29,145
He's tender to her.

220
00:13:29,488 --> 00:13:32,314
She means more to him as a
corpse than as a living person.

221
00:13:32,859 --> 00:13:35,852
Garcia, we need to find the unsub's
network. Even if it's a rough area,

222
00:13:35,972 --> 00:13:37,945
it'll help narrow the
geographic profile.

223
00:13:38,065 --> 00:13:40,057
Sir, that's totally
what I'm trying to figure out.

224
00:13:40,177 --> 00:13:43,575
there is something else kind of huge
you need to know about. Do you see..

225
00:13:44,207 --> 00:13:46,673
...this line of code there?

226
00:13:46,674 --> 00:13:47,813
Yeah, what about them?

227
00:13:47,933 --> 00:13:51,044
It allows the user admin,
and in this case, the unsub,

228
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,710
To set up a chat room.

229
00:13:53,017 --> 00:13:55,244
People were watching this
on the night of the murder.

230
00:13:55,245 --> 00:13:57,718
We thought he was posting these
after the fact. He's not.

231
00:13:57,719 --> 00:13:59,736
He wants people to
experience it with him.

232
00:14:00,289 --> 00:14:01,635
He wants an audience.

233
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,220
He has fans.

234
00:14:13,033 --> 00:14:14,197
Can you freeze that?

235
00:14:14,735 --> 00:14:16,150
He's acknowledging the camera.

236
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,286
Tip of the hat to his fans.
He knows they're watching.

237
00:14:18,406 --> 00:14:20,208
Classic narcissistic behavior.

238
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:21,924
He's performing for his audience.

239
00:14:21,925 --> 00:14:23,472
We know the m.O.
The question is how.

240
00:14:23,473 --> 00:14:25,884
What kind of job gives him
access to the victims' houses?

241
00:14:25,885 --> 00:14:29,278
It has to be network and I.T.S, the guy
you let in to hook up your Internet.

242
00:14:29,398 --> 00:14:31,656
Gets him in their house
and on their computers.

243
00:14:31,657 --> 00:14:34,256
I went through all the women's
Internet service providers

244
00:14:34,257 --> 00:14:35,560
With a fine-tooth comb.

245
00:14:35,561 --> 00:14:39,048
They all used different companies
And no overlap with sales reps.

246
00:14:39,168 --> 00:14:40,997
What about onsite tech support?

247
00:14:41,575 --> 00:14:42,629
clean as a whistle.

248
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:45,015
They all had alibis with
no criminal records.

249
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,727
What I don't understand is,

250
00:14:46,847 --> 00:14:50,061
Why does he take the bodies
with him after they're dead?

251
00:14:50,372 --> 00:14:52,270
it'd be one thing if he took
them while they were still alive,

252
00:14:52,271 --> 00:14:54,320
But he's accomplished his task.

253
00:14:54,321 --> 00:14:57,223
He murders them and he
completes the performance.

254
00:14:57,224 --> 00:15:00,612
So why take the risk of
carrying a corpse to your car?

255
00:15:00,613 --> 00:15:02,027
Well, there must be
some postmortem behavior

256
00:15:02,028 --> 00:15:03,596
Or signature or something
we're not seeing.

257
00:15:03,597 --> 00:15:04,978
we're not seeing. Well, think about
that for a second.

258
00:15:04,979 --> 00:15:08,667
He's sharing this murder
with a crowd of onlookers.

259
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,541
What could he be doing to
these bodies just for himself?

260
00:15:12,738 --> 00:15:13,749
Hey, guys.

261
00:15:14,115 --> 00:15:15,596
Garcia's got something for us.

262
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:17,250
Go ahead, baby girl.

263
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:18,785
Ok, friends,
I have some good news,

264
00:15:18,786 --> 00:15:20,983
But first, here is
the thing that sucks.

265
00:15:20,984 --> 00:15:24,433
I located the network the
unsub is using in Boise,

266
00:15:24,796 --> 00:15:26,593
And it is the
victims' own wireless.

267
00:15:26,594 --> 00:15:28,962
So does he hack in before
he starts with the murders?

268
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:31,498
Hacking is obscenely
time-consuming.

269
00:15:31,618 --> 00:15:34,228
I just make it look easy because
I'm a genius. But he's not me.

270
00:15:34,348 --> 00:15:37,270
So my guess is that he's got
to lurk around their network

271
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:40,273
For at least a couple of days
to a week before he kills them.

272
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:42,108
That's pretty
brilliant on his part.

273
00:15:42,445 --> 00:15:44,010
he knows when we
follow his online paper trail

274
00:15:44,011 --> 00:15:45,879
That it'll lead us right
back to the murder site.

275
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,028
What's the good news?

276
00:15:47,148 --> 00:15:49,683
Hackers are very loyal to
their spoofing techniques,

277
00:15:49,684 --> 00:15:52,454
And if they think no one's watching,
hey'll  use the same roads over and over

278
00:15:52,753 --> 00:15:56,265
Ok, so if he goes through Russia,
China, and north Korea again...

279
00:15:56,266 --> 00:15:58,821
I have flagged those servers, And if
he uses them in the same order,

280
00:15:58,941 --> 00:16:00,436
I will catch him so fast.

281
00:16:00,437 --> 00:16:02,719
That's only going to help us
if he commits another murder.

282
00:16:03,068 --> 00:16:04,550
Yes, that's also true.

283
00:16:04,898 --> 00:16:05,822
Excuse me.

284
00:16:06,335 --> 00:16:08,738
Garcia, if he does
stream this again,

285
00:16:08,739 --> 00:16:10,746
How much time will you
need to find the network?

286
00:16:11,409 --> 00:16:13,930
that's hard to guess with all the
international pinging. I--

287
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:16,200
Ballpark.
7 minutes?

288
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,854
That's not fast enough.
He's in and out of the house in 5.

289
00:16:20,294 --> 00:16:22,294
I'm going to have
to trim my time down, then.

290
00:16:22,295 --> 00:16:26,228
Garcia, get it done. JJ,
we need to call a press conference.

291
00:16:26,229 --> 00:16:27,652
Now that we know how
he's killing these women,

292
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,061
We need to get it out there.

293
00:16:29,062 --> 00:16:31,834
all right, I'll prescreen
the journalists I call on,

294
00:16:31,835 --> 00:16:33,602
Hope we don't get anything
out of left field.

295
00:16:33,603 --> 00:16:34,363
Good.

296
00:16:35,138 --> 00:16:36,650
I know what connects the victims.

297
00:16:37,762 --> 00:16:39,656
I was staring at
pictures of the victims

298
00:16:39,657 --> 00:16:40,825
And I knew there was a
pattern connecting them,

299
00:16:40,826 --> 00:16:43,429
But I couldn't tell what it was until
I broke it down mathematically.

300
00:16:43,549 --> 00:16:45,681
Why are we so drawn
to celebrity faces?

301
00:16:45,682 --> 00:16:47,449
Because there's a
symmetry to their beauty--

302
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:49,613
The eyes, the ears, the ratio
of the forehead to the chin.

303
00:16:49,614 --> 00:16:52,014
The more balanced they are, the more
appealing they are to our eye.

304
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:53,708
These women aren't
celebrities, though.

305
00:16:53,828 --> 00:16:55,077
No, but there are
similarities between them,

306
00:16:55,078 --> 00:16:56,481
And it wasn't until I
scanned their pictures

307
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:58,427
And got it to the guys at Quantico
that I had a full breakdown.

308
00:16:58,428 --> 00:17:00,963
All right, strip away eye color,
hair color, and skin tone,

309
00:17:00,964 --> 00:17:02,998
And what are we left
with geometrically?

310
00:17:02,999 --> 00:17:04,366
They're all slightly dystopic.

311
00:17:04,367 --> 00:17:07,150
The left eye is slightly lower than
the right eye on all the victims.

312
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,409
All the noses are narrow.

313
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:11,940
The forehead has the same Ridge.

314
00:17:11,941 --> 00:17:14,001
He might not even be aware
that he sees it in them.

315
00:17:14,121 --> 00:17:16,661
There have been studies that suggest
that we pick our spouses subconsciously

316
00:17:16,781 --> 00:17:18,680
Based on a facial symmetry
that we recognize.

317
00:17:18,681 --> 00:17:20,476
So consciously or unconsciously,

318
00:17:20,596 --> 00:17:23,033
When he recognizes it,
he has to destroy it.

319
00:17:23,153 --> 00:17:26,503
Which means he only has interest in the
bodies as they relate back to him

320
00:17:27,097 --> 00:17:28,038
Maybe...

321
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:30,759
They're a reflection.

322
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,389
Remember what he did at
the end of the video?

323
00:17:36,888 --> 00:17:38,700
He wiped the tear away.

324
00:17:38,701 --> 00:17:41,470
Another act of compassion
he's not capable of.

325
00:17:41,471 --> 00:17:43,572
His narcissism
prevents him from that.

326
00:17:43,573 --> 00:17:45,669
In the Greek myth,
narcissus was so self-absorbed

327
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,841
That he fell in love with his
own reflection in the water.

328
00:17:47,914 --> 00:17:50,212
Exactly. He finds women
with the same face,

329
00:17:50,332 --> 00:17:53,888
He strangles them, and then
stares at them after they've died.

330
00:17:54,219 --> 00:17:56,417
But whose image
does he really see?

331
00:17:56,714 --> 00:17:57,481
His own.

332
00:18:03,993 --> 00:18:04,928
Thank you.

333
00:18:36,017 --> 00:18:37,793
Most of us take the
Internet for granted.

334
00:18:38,058 --> 00:18:40,229
We forget about
texts that we share

335
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,580
Or updates we put
on social networks.

336
00:18:42,581 --> 00:18:44,466
But the Internet never forgets.

337
00:18:44,467 --> 00:18:46,401
Once it's out there,
it's out there forever.

338
00:18:46,846 --> 00:18:49,516
Now, we all know about the horrific
deaths that get shown on the Web.

339
00:18:49,636 --> 00:18:52,269
The murder of a journalist.
The stoning of an Iranian dissident.

340
00:18:52,914 --> 00:18:54,222
Those murders are immortal.

341
00:18:54,605 --> 00:18:57,003
And this unsub craves
that same immortality.

342
00:18:57,004 --> 00:18:58,700
He recognizes his face on theirs

343
00:18:58,701 --> 00:19:00,477
And he kills them
as a way of saying,

344
00:19:00,478 --> 00:19:01,732
<i>"This is what I look like."</i>

345
00:19:01,733 --> 00:19:04,604
We think this also informs his
compulsion To take the bodies with him

346
00:19:04,724 --> 00:19:06,596
He takes them to a
secondary location

347
00:19:06,597 --> 00:19:08,398
Where we believe
he preserves them,

348
00:19:08,904 --> 00:19:11,515
So that every time he looks at them,
He sees his own ego reflected.

349
00:19:11,939 --> 00:19:15,352
Fortunately for us, this means we have
a good idea of what he looks like.

350
00:19:15,618 --> 00:19:18,074
Based on the shape of
the victims' faces,

351
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:20,676
We have a rough composite sketch.

352
00:19:21,345 --> 00:19:24,251
This unsub is an expert with
computers and home networks.

353
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,461
So look into criminal records of men
with extensive computer training.

354
00:19:27,581 --> 00:19:30,495
We know you've already looked into
the victims' computer I.T. Settings,

355
00:19:30,615 --> 00:19:32,722
So we'd like to expand the search.

356
00:19:32,723 --> 00:19:34,190
Look into electronic stores,

357
00:19:34,191 --> 00:19:37,226
Computer distributors, I.T.
Departments where the women worked.

358
00:19:37,227 --> 00:19:39,712
We overuse the term
narcissistic in our culture,

359
00:19:39,713 --> 00:19:42,053
But we're going back to the
psychological definition.

360
00:19:42,173 --> 00:19:44,005
Every aspect of this man's life

361
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:46,499
Has been constructed around
an inflated sense of self.

362
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,924
Unsubs like this are
particularly vulnerable

363
00:19:48,925 --> 00:19:51,427
To what's called
narcissistic injury.

364
00:19:51,428 --> 00:19:55,446
If his self-worth is attacked
or damaged, he will lash out.

365
00:19:55,765 --> 00:19:59,401
So, if you find this unsub,
do not challenge him publicly.

366
00:19:59,718 --> 00:20:02,823
Say you just want to talk him, See if
he knows anything about the

367
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:05,755
the brilliant mastermind
Who's stalking these women.

368
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:08,310
Under no circumstances
should you denigrate him.

369
00:20:08,732 --> 00:20:11,380
As difficult as it is,
we need to talk up his exploits

370
00:20:11,381 --> 00:20:12,708
As if we respected him.

371
00:20:13,873 --> 00:20:16,535
<i>Searching for wireless
server found kitgirl29</i>

372
00:20:22,092 --> 00:20:24,426
This is a sketch of the
man we're looking for.

373
00:20:24,427 --> 00:20:25,828
He is a white male,

374
00:20:25,829 --> 00:20:27,296
Roughly 5'10".

375
00:20:27,297 --> 00:20:30,099
He's highly skilled with
computers and networks.

376
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,693
We encourage everyone to

377
00:20:31,694 --> 00:20:33,924
monitor the information
they post about themselves

378
00:20:33,925 --> 00:20:35,130
On social networks.

379
00:20:35,131 --> 00:20:38,379
Do not document the
details of your day.

380
00:20:38,499 --> 00:20:41,392
Don't post pictures of yourself,
friends, or family.

381
00:20:41,512 --> 00:20:43,392
All right, we'll take
some questions. Yeah?

382
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:46,307
How did the FBI generate this sketch
if there were no eyewitnesses?

383
00:20:46,308 --> 00:20:49,777
It's a approximation based
on a video we recovered.

384
00:20:49,778 --> 00:20:51,712
Ok, yeah, what's your question?

385
00:20:51,713 --> 00:20:53,352
Can you comment on the rumor he

386
00:20:53,472 --> 00:20:55,967
has some sort of facial
symmetry with his victims?

387
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:57,764
Does he look like them?

388
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,938
Right now the Boise police are
pursuing several theories.

389
00:21:00,972 --> 00:21:02,382
That's not a no.

390
00:21:02,383 --> 00:21:04,350
Why would he target
women who look like him?

391
00:21:04,351 --> 00:21:07,582
It's too soon to speculate on how
or why he chooses his victims.

392
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,638
Well, what should people
do to protect themselves,

393
00:21:09,639 --> 00:21:10,758
change their face?

394
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:13,324
No, just update
your online security

395
00:21:13,325 --> 00:21:15,125
And be vigilant
about what you post.

396
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:16,629
All right, we're
done with questions.

397
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:18,064
Thank you. Thank you.

398
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,157
Hotch.

399
00:21:31,158 --> 00:21:32,873
Somebody leaked our profile.

400
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:35,883
The press started asking
questions about facial symmetry.

401
00:21:35,934 --> 00:21:37,637
It must have been one
of your officers.

402
00:21:37,638 --> 00:21:40,548
Look, my guys were checking their
cell phones, but that's just habit now.

403
00:21:40,668 --> 00:21:42,896
All right, I can talk to
the press independently,

404
00:21:42,897 --> 00:21:44,431
I can keep this off
the 10:00 news, but--

405
00:21:44,432 --> 00:21:46,091
I know. It went out live.

406
00:21:46,211 --> 00:21:48,691
Well, what are the
chances he didn't see it?

407
00:21:48,692 --> 00:21:50,283
Not good.

408
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:56,176
Oh, your crafty little sicko.

409
00:21:58,479 --> 00:22:00,681
Sir, it's fantastic you called.
I just figured out--

410
00:22:00,682 --> 00:22:02,749
How are you doing on
pinning down the networks?

411
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,189
Ok, that's what I'm
trying to tell you.

412
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:07,065
Remember how I said he was spoofing
his signal off different servers?

413
00:22:07,066 --> 00:22:09,920
Well, it turns out some of those
are a decoy meant to waste my time.

414
00:22:09,921 --> 00:22:11,557
So does that mean you
can find him faster?

415
00:22:11,558 --> 00:22:15,160
Totally. Totally. I can write a program
that filters out the decoys--

416
00:22:15,396 --> 00:22:16,930
Oh, crap.

417
00:22:16,931 --> 00:22:17,964
Is that him?

418
00:22:17,965 --> 00:22:19,752
Yeah. Uh...

419
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:23,481
Ok. It looks like I'm gonna
have to filter this on the fly.

420
00:22:23,601 --> 00:22:25,114
Can you send us the feed?

421
00:22:25,115 --> 00:22:27,348
I think I can intercept
it in Ukraine.

422
00:22:27,349 --> 00:22:29,062
He's going live.

423
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:31,974
Look at the way he's moving.

424
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:34,148
He's not slow and deliberate.
This guy's pissed.

425
00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:35,623
All right, what do we see?
Determining markers.

426
00:22:35,624 --> 00:22:36,891
A one-story cottage.

427
00:22:36,892 --> 00:22:39,071
It could be anywhere.
Is there a number on the house?

428
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,962
No, and he's already at the door.

429
00:22:40,963 --> 00:22:41,681
Garcia.

430
00:22:41,682 --> 00:22:44,288
He's using twice as
many proxy servers.

431
00:22:44,289 --> 00:22:47,295
Wait. This window here on the bottom-
is that the chat room?

432
00:22:47,415 --> 00:22:49,400
There she is.
He's in the house, guys.

433
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:50,897
He's completely changed his m.O.

434
00:22:50,898 --> 00:22:52,140
It is way too early.
There's too much light.

435
00:22:52,141 --> 00:22:53,107
What happened?

436
00:22:53,108 --> 00:22:55,610
Someone asked the wrong question
at the press conference.

437
00:22:55,611 --> 00:22:58,446
Oh, my God, turn around.
Just turn around.

438
00:22:58,447 --> 00:22:59,894
Maybe she can fend him off.

439
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,950
New kitchen appliances.
Can we track them through work orders?

440
00:23:01,951 --> 00:23:04,233
He'll be gone by then.
Garcia, give us something.

441
00:23:04,353 --> 00:23:06,054
I'm stateside now.
I'm almost to Idaho.

442
00:23:06,055 --> 00:23:07,889
You're not gonna make it.
I just need more time.

443
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,591
Yes, I will. I will. I--

444
00:23:09,592 --> 00:23:12,262
Forget the unsub. Can you run
a trace on everybody in the chat room?

445
00:23:12,382 --> 00:23:14,863
I can't do both, sir.
Let me do this.

446
00:23:14,864 --> 00:23:16,965
Garcia, tag the viewers.
That's an order.

447
00:24:02,181 --> 00:24:04,483
Baby girl, it's gonna be OK.

448
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:06,151
No, no, it's not. It's bad enough

449
00:24:06,152 --> 00:24:08,086
That there's been so
much death around me,

450
00:24:08,087 --> 00:24:10,579
But this guy is all up in my turf,

451
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,400
And he's really good at what he
does for really awful reasons.

452
00:24:13,417 --> 00:24:15,027
That's why you're gonna
find the perverts

453
00:24:15,028 --> 00:24:17,613
That watched it happen in that chat
room, and we'll nail them to the wall

454
00:24:17,733 --> 00:24:19,296
And they're gonna
give up the unsub.

455
00:24:19,325 --> 00:24:20,421
No, no, that is not good enough.

456
00:24:20,422 --> 00:24:24,374
I want to watch him suffer.
I want to watch him bleed.

457
00:24:24,637 --> 00:24:26,374
Oh, God, I just scared myself.

458
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:28,301
Good. That's a good thing.

459
00:24:28,421 --> 00:24:30,661
Because if there's one thing
I've learned the hard way

460
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,578
Is the last person you want to
tick off is miss Penelope Garcia.

461
00:24:33,579 --> 00:24:36,791
Ohh...That's a compliment, right?

462
00:24:36,911 --> 00:24:38,317
Yes, it is.

463
00:24:39,069 --> 00:24:40,966
We will beat this guy.
Believe that.

464
00:24:41,086 --> 00:24:44,069
Now, I'll call you when
we've got something. Ok.

465
00:24:46,766 --> 00:24:48,609
Her name was Allison Kittridge, 29.

466
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:50,609
This was her first house.

467
00:24:53,441 --> 00:24:56,505
All right, so this unsub accelerated
his timetable and his m.O.

468
00:24:56,506 --> 00:24:58,331
He was moving faster
because he was angry.

469
00:24:58,332 --> 00:25:01,163
Yeah. The press conference told him
something about himself he didn't like,

470
00:25:01,283 --> 00:25:03,177
So he rushed. Which
means he made a mistake.

471
00:25:03,178 --> 00:25:05,527
Now, what was it?

472
00:25:07,722 --> 00:25:09,039
Well, it wasn't the cameras.

473
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,850
He remembered to
take those with him.

474
00:25:10,851 --> 00:25:13,644
It wasn't the body.
He took that with him, too.

475
00:25:16,045 --> 00:25:20,724
Hey, did, uh, Garcia find anything
unusual with Allison's wireless?

476
00:25:20,725 --> 00:25:24,558
No. Records show that it was
a basic DSL installation.

477
00:25:26,717 --> 00:25:28,571
Hey, Prentiss.

478
00:25:28,572 --> 00:25:30,718
Yeah. Help me move this table.

479
00:25:33,457 --> 00:25:35,058
What do you got?

480
00:25:38,334 --> 00:25:39,963
You see this line right here?

481
00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:42,743
Yeah.

482
00:25:42,744 --> 00:25:45,135
This is what brings the Internet
from the street into the house.

483
00:25:45,136 --> 00:25:48,492
Ok. So? This isn't DSL.

484
00:25:48,493 --> 00:25:49,607
It's not?

485
00:25:49,608 --> 00:25:51,098
It's a fiber-optic cable.

486
00:25:51,099 --> 00:25:53,105
Completely different
type of connection.

487
00:25:55,746 --> 00:25:58,181
We just found his mistake.

488
00:26:00,527 --> 00:26:02,693
If there's already an Internet
connection in the house,

489
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:04,889
Why does he bring his own with him?
Is it the upload speed?

490
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:07,045
Fiber-optic allows him to
stream large amounts of video.

491
00:26:07,063 --> 00:26:08,370
And maintain a chat room.

492
00:26:08,371 --> 00:26:10,734
That's dozens of computers
connected to him at once.

493
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:13,175
He'd need a lot of bandwidth
for something like that.

494
00:26:13,176 --> 00:26:15,620
We checked all the ISPs.
Why didn't he turn up?

495
00:26:15,621 --> 00:26:18,211
I get mail, phone calls,
people knock on my door all the time

496
00:26:18,212 --> 00:26:20,660
To see if I want to upgrade my
Internet. Yeah, I get them, too.

497
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,680
And they'll offer to come
inside and demonstrate

498
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:24,564
How much faster
their connection is.

499
00:26:24,565 --> 00:26:26,550
You think that's the ruse
that gets him in the door?

500
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:27,785
It makes sense.

501
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:30,835
During his demonstration, he would
have access to his victims' computers.

502
00:26:30,854 --> 00:26:32,735
On his way out,
he asks for a glass of water,

503
00:26:32,736 --> 00:26:35,694
A distraction, something to buy enough
time to plant that first camera.

504
00:26:35,814 --> 00:26:37,922
We need to find out what
company owns this cable.

505
00:26:37,939 --> 00:26:39,618
Detective Fordham's
already hunting that down,

506
00:26:39,619 --> 00:26:41,843
And there's an I.D. Number on it,
so it shouldn't take long.

507
00:26:41,844 --> 00:26:43,044
We'll have JJ and Reid follow up.

508
00:26:43,045 --> 00:26:44,813
I need you two to track down
who was in the chat room.

509
00:26:44,814 --> 00:26:46,114
Garcia finished her sweep?

510
00:26:46,115 --> 00:26:47,830
Yeah. Most were international.
3 were local.

511
00:26:47,838 --> 00:26:49,535
I bet one of them knows the unsub.

512
00:27:01,461 --> 00:27:02,881
FBI.

513
00:27:02,882 --> 00:27:04,530
We have a warrant.

514
00:27:23,077 --> 00:27:24,459
Help you gentlemen?

515
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,527
Austin Chapman?

516
00:27:25,528 --> 00:27:27,028
Yeah, that's me.

517
00:27:27,508 --> 00:27:28,463
FBI.

518
00:27:28,464 --> 00:27:32,354
We need talk to you about a
video you watched last night.

519
00:27:33,764 --> 00:27:36,128
I'm sorry. What video?

520
00:27:36,129 --> 00:27:38,473
This is a warrant for all the
computers in your possession.

521
00:27:38,474 --> 00:27:40,497
You're under arrest for
accessory to murder.

522
00:27:40,498 --> 00:27:41,809
Accessory?

523
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:43,646
Watching a murder happen online

524
00:27:43,647 --> 00:27:46,103
and doing nothing
about it Is a felony.

525
00:27:48,284 --> 00:27:51,205
I don't know what
you're talking about.

526
00:27:51,911 --> 00:27:53,735
What murder?

527
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:58,826
Yes, this is our cable.

528
00:27:58,853 --> 00:28:00,662
Mrs. Hightower,
we went over your records,

529
00:28:00,663 --> 00:28:02,463
And it turns out that
none of the 4 victims

530
00:28:02,464 --> 00:28:03,765
Signed up with your service.

531
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:07,025
4? God, those poor women.

532
00:28:07,026 --> 00:28:09,904
We think it's an employee
using your cable as a ruse

533
00:28:09,905 --> 00:28:11,773
To get into the house.
Can you think of any--

534
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:13,575
Mac Jones.

535
00:28:13,576 --> 00:28:15,677
Uh, he worked on one of our trucks

536
00:28:15,678 --> 00:28:18,475
As we laid the fiber in
with the regular phone line.

537
00:28:18,476 --> 00:28:19,826
And you're certain that it's him?

538
00:28:19,946 --> 00:28:23,585
We caught him hoarding it.
He said it was for a home project.

539
00:28:23,586 --> 00:28:26,682
Until we got angry phone calls
that he was going door to door

540
00:28:26,683 --> 00:28:29,591
Offering free fiber-optic
installation.

541
00:28:29,592 --> 00:28:31,125
We fired him on the spot.

542
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,360
We need his information.

543
00:28:32,361 --> 00:28:33,595
Absolutely.

544
00:28:35,531 --> 00:28:39,467
Ladies and gentlemen,
meet Mac Jones.

545
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:41,798
That isn't the I.D.
We got from the phone company.

546
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:45,385
That's because last year Mr.
Jones had his identity stolen.

547
00:28:45,386 --> 00:28:47,508
The unsub took his license
and his credit card,

548
00:28:47,509 --> 00:28:49,482
Used them for 2 weeks,
and then moved on.

549
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:52,029
I can't tell you who the
unsub is pretending to be now,

550
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,154
But since a picture's worth
a thousand databases,

551
00:28:54,155 --> 00:28:55,626
I can tell you who he was.

552
00:28:55,627 --> 00:28:57,485
Robert Johnson, 3-time loser,

553
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:59,075
Arrested for possession
of torture videos.

554
00:28:59,101 --> 00:29:01,623
Spent some time in a halfway
house before he disappeared.

555
00:29:01,624 --> 00:29:03,758
I found a blog of his online.
Here's a quote--

556
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:06,160
"Next time you won't
be able to stop me."

557
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,795
That's his narcissism again.

558
00:29:07,796 --> 00:29:10,598
Furious that he got caught and
he remakes himself as a killer.

559
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:12,817
It allows him to free the
impulses that were always there.

560
00:29:12,818 --> 00:29:15,270
Garcia, is there a pattern to
the identities that he steals?

561
00:29:15,271 --> 00:29:17,160
No. He's really
disciplined about it.

562
00:29:17,161 --> 00:29:19,645
Once he burns through an identity,
he never uses the same one again.

563
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:22,410
You know how I describe some
suspects as being off the grid?

564
00:29:22,411 --> 00:29:24,465
This guy is totally the opposite.

565
00:29:24,466 --> 00:29:26,065
He's all over the grid.

566
00:29:26,066 --> 00:29:27,555
He's manipulating the grid.

567
00:29:27,556 --> 00:29:29,417
And he never stays in
one place for very long.

568
00:29:29,418 --> 00:29:31,019
So how do we find
out who he is now?

569
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,387
I don't think we're going to.

570
00:29:32,388 --> 00:29:34,922
The man known as Robert
Johnson is in the wind.

571
00:29:34,923 --> 00:29:37,959
If he's this flexible with his name,
his real name, forget it.

572
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,827
But there's another
way we can find him.

573
00:29:39,828 --> 00:29:40,828
Which is?

574
00:29:40,829 --> 00:29:41,863
His online name,

575
00:29:41,864 --> 00:29:43,197
His hacker handle.

576
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,466
That's the name
that matters to him.

577
00:29:45,467 --> 00:29:47,410
Wait. Wouldn't he have
hundreds of those, too?

578
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:49,637
Most definitely. But remember
how I said hackers are loyal?

579
00:29:49,638 --> 00:29:51,205
They stick to certain names.

580
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,357
That's how you identify
yourself to other hackers.

581
00:29:53,722 --> 00:29:55,543
That's how the FBI caught me.

582
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:57,111
So if we find the handle...

583
00:29:57,112 --> 00:29:59,881
I'll get you the unsub. I promise.

584
00:30:00,816 --> 00:30:05,201
Look, I wish I could
help you find

585
00:30:05,321 --> 00:30:07,755
the guy posting these videos,

586
00:30:07,756 --> 00:30:11,286
But I never visited that website,
man. Right.

587
00:30:11,406 --> 00:30:14,295
Maybe somebody broke into
my computer or something.

588
00:30:14,296 --> 00:30:16,064
See, Scott, we think it was you.

589
00:30:16,065 --> 00:30:18,380
And we found some pretty
interesting movies

590
00:30:18,381 --> 00:30:20,410
in your hard drive To
back up our theory.
