00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,790
Previously on criminal minds...

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,320
- where are we headed?
- new york.

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:04,120
What do we know?

4
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:05,450
All the killings are mid-day.

5
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,340
Single gunshot to the head with a .22

6
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,860
Surveillance cameras have
captured video of 3 of the murders.

7
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:10,720
They're all the same.

8
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,500
He wears a hood and keeps his head down.

9
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,290
Kate joyner heads up the
new york field office.

10
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,460
She's running point on the case along
with detectives brustin and cooper.

11
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:18,870
From the placement of that camera,

12
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,860
Odds are the only view they're
gonna get is the back of his head.

13
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,690
Let's not be too quick to
decide what we do or don't have.

14
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,660
You mind telling me why i'm
catching attitude from her?

15
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,760
Fbi brass has made it clear to her that
if she doesn't bring this case home,

16
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,180
She's gonna be reassigned.

17
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,460
And you are at the top of
the list to replace her.

18
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:34,250
Profile me.

19
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,490
You don't wear a ring.

20
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,860
And you were quick to flirt with me.

21
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,680
So you're happy to let
people think you are a player.

22
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,170
But you love your wife, and you
would never actually cheat on her.

23
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,110
Get out of the way!

24
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,220
Garcia!

25
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:54,160
We've got an officer down,
16th west of union square.

26
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,510
We think we might have a serious
problem. We have multiple unsubs.

27
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,110
They're disciplined, they're
using countersurveillance,

28
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,680
They know the fbi movements,
there's a hierarchy.

29
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:04,730
What does that usually equal?

30
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:05,590
Terrorism.

31
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,530
They're ramping up to something, and they
want us to know that they're watching us.

32
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:13,270
Creating panic ensures that they're see the
most urgent response time short of a bombing.

33
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,320
We need to hit the ground running.

34
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,190
Hey, you ok?

35
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,520
- sir, are you o--
- what's your name?

36
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:30,520
What?

37
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:33,680
- what's your name?
- sam.

38
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,730
Call 911.

39
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,760
Yeah, yeah, i did.

40
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,880
Call 911, tell them
there's been an explosion.

41
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,420
Sir, are you ok?

42
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,840
You a cop?

43
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,960
Listen, kate. Don't
worry. We'll get 'em.

44
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,820
I know.

45
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,890
Call 911. Tell them...

46
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,890
That a federal agent...

47
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,230
- ok, so you want
me to say-- - kate!

48
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:11,990
Kate!

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,920
- 911, this is the guy that called about the explosion.
- kate!

50
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,980
Kate! Kate?

51
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:33,840
Kate?

52
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,640
My purse! I can't find my purse.

53
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,550
- don't move.
- aaron, my purse.

54
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,250
I don't think you had one.

55
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,950
I must have dropped it.

56
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,880
Kate, kate, kate, stop trying to move.

57
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:56,520
Aaron. Aaron? -what happened to you?

58
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:57,950
- what happened?
- i don't know.

59
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,000
I don't know, a bomb. An
i.e.d. I think it was an i.e.d.

60
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,610
I.e.d.? I have to get up.

61
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,340
No, no, no, no. Lie down. Lie
still. You need to lie still.

62
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:10,080
- am i moving my legs?
- what?

63
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:18,470
Am i moving my legs?

64
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,750
- i may have to turn you and see where the blood is coming from.
- do it.

65
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,440
Ok.it might hurt. Sorry.

66
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,190
Here, i'm gonna have to see...

67
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,310
- are you ok? - yeah.you
just need to, um--

68
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,410
I'm gonna have to see if i can...

69
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:41,130
Just pinch it off until they
get here. Sorry, i know it hurts.

70
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,380
No... It doesn't hurt.

71
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,330
It doesn't hurt at all.

72
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,970
Kate, kate, we're gonna
get you out of here, ok?

73
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,460
We're gonna get you out of here.

74
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,880
They're coming, they're
coming. Officer down!

75
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,840
Officer down! Here!

76
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:03,170
Aaron.

77
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,520
They're not coming.

78
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,850
We told them not to, remember?

79
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,790
Now, how does this work?

80
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,440
The murders simulate a bombing.

81
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:15,090
They station someone to watch
and gauge police response time.

82
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,000
At which point they know when
to bring in a second bomb.

83
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,260
The goal is always to take out
the first round of civilians,

84
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,480
Followed by a second wave
of emergency responders.

85
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,460
The first wave of
responders are targets.

Never think that war, no matter how
necessary nor how justified is not a crime.

Ernest hemingway.

91
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,170
You can't let go, can you, hotch?

92
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:26,990
Aaron...

93
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,630
You don't have to stay.

94
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,960
I'm not leaving.

95
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:38,120
Officer down! We need
some help! We cannot move!

96
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,560
They're not coming.

97
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:45,140
Yes, your orders are
not to let anyone in

98
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:48,210
Until the area is cleared.

99
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,230
Oh, man.

100
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:54,090
- but that's-- -
that's proper procedure.

101
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:05,940
We're getting reports that an explosion has rocked
the neighborhood in the vicinity of the federal plaza.

102
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,040
Authorities have closed
down the entire area

103
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,850
And are not going to give
any information at this time.

104
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:14,130
And with 8 suspicious incidences
in as little as 3 weeks,

105
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,230
We have no room but to speculate whether
or not there will be more attacks.

106
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,840
We have no word yet on any injuries,

107
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:22,950
But with the explosion heard
as far away as prince street,

108
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,300
An unconfirmed report
said it was a car bomb.

109
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,750
Nypd's emergency services,
as well as federal...

{\a6}<i>NYPD COMMAND CENTER</i>

111
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,520
David, i heard on the radio.
I tried the others, but--

112
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:30,700
The cell phone system is crashing.

113
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,450
- a car bomb. Did they say where?
- no.

114
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,790
Can you recall every site
where the shootings occurred?

115
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,730
Uh, hell's kitchen, murray
hill, lower east side, chinatown.

116
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,280
All right, if our profile is correct and all
8 murders were tests to gauge response times,

117
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:45,200
We're looking at 8 suicide bombers who are
about to hit every one of those locations.

118
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,510
Call homeland security.

119
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,680
Tell them to pour troops
into all of those sites.

120
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:51,180
Actually, if we're correct,
there'll be 16 suicide bombers.

121
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:51,830
16?

122
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,100
Yeah, we predicted that they'll hit the
second wave of emergency responders also.

123
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,340
Breaking news now. We are
just getting an update.

124
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:00,530
The bomb is now reported
to have been inside an suv.

125
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:04,790
A black suv parked just
blocks from 26 federal plaza.

126
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,250
Now, it is un...

00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:08,660
{\a6}<i>CCTV COMMAND POST</i>

128
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,560
Agent rossi? We heard there
was some kind of explosion.

129
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,080
- we got this.
- where are you?

130
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,300
I just walked into
the cctv command post.

131
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,280
Can you see anything?

132
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,120
I literally just walked
through the door, sir.

133
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:17,720
We got on the news it
was an suv that exploded.

134
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,080
A black suv within blocks
of the federal plaza.

135
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:23,110
- oh, god.
- now, do you have eyes there?

136
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,090
I, uh--yeah, yeah, i've got like 300
cameras right there. Give me a sec.

137
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,610
I'm here with reid, but i
don't know where anyone else is.

138
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,540
- and, garcia...
- yes, sir.

139
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:34,330
- find them.
- ok.

140
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:38,850
Lisa, i need every feed of every camera for 20
blocks concentrically out from the federal plaza.

141
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,430
Get the best exposure
from every angle you can

142
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,830
- and then back those feeds up.
- you got it.

143
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,070
I'm gonna call the rest of my team.

144
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,310
Yeah. I'm still here.

145
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,740
Yes, you are. Thank god.

146
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,930
I'm almost back at the federal
building. What the hell's going on?

147
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,250
All right, we're going over the
closed circuit footage right now.

148
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,490
Who else have you checked on?

149
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,260
You're the first. Rossi
and reid called me.

150
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:09,080
All right, well, keep me on the line
while you check on everyone else.

151
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,280
Is everyone ok?

152
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,320
I've spoken to rossi and
reid and morgan's on the line.

153
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,350
Emily, where are you?

154
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,560
I'm following detective brustin to one of
the nypd's critical incident command posts.

155
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,670
One of them? Yeah, after
911 they decentralized.

156
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,720
They had way too many eggs
in one basket on that day.

157
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,220
Has anyone talked to jj?

158
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,760
She was headed back to the hotel.

159
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:27,350
- in an suv?
- i think so.

160
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,690
Stay with me a minute.
I'll dial her mobile.

161
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:34,090
This is agent jareau, communications
director for the fbi's behavioral--

162
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,630
What was that? What happened?

163
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,650
It went dead mid-message.

164
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,820
Try here again. She's
probably back at--

165
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,420
Emily?

166
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,600
Derek. Derek?

167
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,540
- i just lost all contact with my team.
- i found it.

168
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:50,340
I've never not
been able to--

169
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,470
- garcia.
- what?

170
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,920
I found the explosion.

171
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,440
{\a6}<i>F.B.I.Field Office 26
FEDERAL PLAZA.MANHATTAN</i>

172
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,510
Move to marshaling area echo.

173
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,910
There should be a team captain there.

174
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,470
Please report to your team
captain and identify yourself.

175
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,970
Move to marshaling area echo.

176
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,690
- there should be a team
captain there-- - shelly!

177
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,810
Do you know what happened?

178
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,290
Only that there was an explosion nearby.

179
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,590
We had to evacuate this building.

180
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,050
- they're anticipating a second wave.
- have you seen hotch or kate?

181
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,210
No. I was hoping you did.

182
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,660
Have you seen any of my team?

183
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,890
Sorry, i...

184
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,840
All right, well me must be setting up a
critical incident command center, right?

185
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:21,670
700 hudson, south of laight
in the tribeca district.

186
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,430
Ok. You see any of my
team, that's where i'll be.

187
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,710
Ok.

188
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,280
Move to marshaling area echo.

189
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:28,540
There should be a team captain there.

190
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,340
- oh, my god!
- they weren't inside.

191
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,620
- they-- -
weren't inside.

192
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,930
Right. Play it again. Right now.

193
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,150
Move this camera.

194
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,200
I have to see where they ended--
where--where they are now.

195
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,430
This isn't live, penelope.

196
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,520
Right. Get me another angle. We have
to see what happened to hotch and kate.

197
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:01,910
Wait!

198
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,030
- what are you doing?
- we're going further back.

199
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,860
That explosion looked like it came
from under the suv, not inside it,

200
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,150
So i'm gonna guess that bomb
wasn't there when it was parked.

201
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:17,590
That's him. The bomber.

202
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,060
Uh, get me another angle,
at timecode 12:06:06.

203
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,920
Got him.

204
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,630
He stopped.

205
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,950
Sam, you need to get out of the area.

206
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,550
I just want to help.

207
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:36,410
If you want to help,
get somebody down here.

208
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,570
Kate, i need you to wake up.

209
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:42,130
Stay with me. Stay with me.

210
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,840
- i feel cold.
- what?

211
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:50,340
It's such a cliche,
isn't it? I feel cold.

212
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,180
Like in the cinema.

213
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:54,590
You've lost a lot of blood,
but i think i've got it stopped.

214
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,130
Wait. That's not right. It's movies.

215
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:00,400
Um, you say movies, not cinema.

216
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:02,450
Just try to relax.

217
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,360
Why--why would you have
a different word for...

218
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,680
All right, if they can't get down here,
i'm gonna try to lift you and just--

219
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:13,870
- they just told me to get behind the barricade.
- ok, here, i'm gonna try to lift her.

220
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,990
All right, on 3. 1, 2, 3.

221
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,200
No, i lost it. I lost my grip.

222
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:21,720
All right, i need to find
it again. Need to find it.

223
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,560
- kate, stay with me.
- she's bleeding. She's bleeding!

224
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,020
I think i've got it. I think i got it.

225
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,390
She's not gonna die, is she?

226
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,600
Kate, stay with us, please.

227
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:33,450
We're here! Please!

228
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:37,220
Please! We're here!

229
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:39,940
Someone!

230
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,480
Who's in charge here?

231
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:54,400
Captain warner.

232
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,540
- ok, ok, let's get this area cleared
as soon as possible. - captain warner--

233
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,610
We got people down there.

234
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,820
Captain warner, i'm agent morgan, fbi.

235
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,970
I'm looking for agent
hotchner, aaron hotchner.

236
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,400
Go back to the federal building.

237
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:04,900
There are evac marshaling spots.

238
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,500
Check in to make sure
they know where you are.

239
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,530
I am not about to do that.

240
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:12,510
Get out of my face or i'll
have you bodily removed, agent.

241
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,830
Please, we're here!

242
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,560
Hotch.

243
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,600
The area's restricted.

244
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:21,870
That's my boss down there.

245
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,000
My orders are what they are.

246
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,730
I don't give a damn
what your orders are.

247
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,930
I get it, agent.

248
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:29,310
But we've been told by you
responders are the targets.

249
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,910
So till the blast site is
cleared, no one goes in.

250
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,220
You're marine corps, right? Right?

251
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,450
Please, go back to the marshaling point.

252
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,410
I'm not doing it.

253
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,980
I'm not just gonna let my
man lay down there like that.

254
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,260
Help us! Damn it, we're here!

255
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,170
Never leave a man behind. You
do remember that, don't you?

256
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,710
We're here! Please!

257
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,780
Ok.

258
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,820
Hotch! Hotch!

259
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,910
Fast-forward it.

260
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,470
He watched.

261
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,960
That son of a bitch watched.

262
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,270
Get me another timecode.

263
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,060
12:29:13

264
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,700
Oh, my god, that's the unsub.

265
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:25,100
And he's walking right up to hotch.

266
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,280
- hotch.
- morgan, we've got to get her out of here.

267
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:30,770
They're not letting any ambulances
down here till they clear the scene.

268
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,600
Kid, you gotta get behind
the barricades. Let's go. Go!

269
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:36,050
- go, sam.
- good luck.

270
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:41,020
Talk to me. Can we carry her?

271
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,120
Hotch, can we carry her?

272
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,040
No, i tried.

273
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:47,380
Morgan, she's gonna bleed to death if we don't
get her out of here. We gotta do something.

274
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:51,330
Please have service. Please have service.
Please have service. Please have service.

275
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:54,730
Garcia, i got hotch.

276
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,620
But listen to me.

277
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,820
You gotta get somebody down here
right away, you hear me? Right now.

278
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:03,770
What? You're absolutely sure?

279
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:09,330
Hotch. The kid. He's the bomber.

280
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,450
Go.

281
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:09,090
She's got an arterial bleed in her back
and i'm doing my best to hold it closed.

282
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:09,970
You ok?

283
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,330
I just want to get her out of here.

284
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,070
Her pulse is weak and thready.

285
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,280
- i'm gonna need your help, ok?
- Ok.

286
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,110
Is the area clear?

287
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,660
You were calling for help
and i couldn't listen anymore.

288
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,080
My partner was too afraid
to come in here with me.

289
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:24,180
Kate, we're gonna get you out of here.

290
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,520
We're on our way out of here.

291
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:28,560
These are stills from
all the murder sites.

292
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,830
Garcia had us on conference
and the system crashed.

293
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,980
Emily.

294
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:34,040
Oh, thank god you're
all right.where's will?

295
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:37,050
He's stuck at the airport. As soon
as i heard, i went straight to 26 fed.

296
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,690
They're evacuating the
building. Where is everyone?

297
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,450
Morgan's all right, but
there's no word from hotch.

298
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,530
The bomber! The bomber!

299
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,700
- what?
- derek's chasing after him.

300
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:47,240
The bomb--it was in
kate's suv or under it.

301
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,310
Hotch is out there with her.

302
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:50,450
He seems ok, but she looks
really hurt. He hasn't moved her.

303
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,040
Where was kate's suv parked?

304
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,530
2 blocks east of federal plaza.

305
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:56,110
2 blocks east and
they target kate's suv?

306
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,450
Have you i. D. Ed the bomber?

307
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:00,000
Lisa's running him and
dead guy through vicap.

308
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,150
Call homeland security.

309
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,550
They should be at all the murder sites.

310
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,560
- see if they found anything.
- i'm on it.

311
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:07,090
Garcia, find out how we can help morgan.

312
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,630
Yes, sir.

313
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:12,850
This is an emergency notification all train
services are suspended until further notice.

314
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:17,270
Please remain calm and exit the station.

315
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:22,120
Out of my way! Move! Move!
Where did he go? Where?

316
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:26,270
This is an emergency notification.

317
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:30,280
All train services will be

318
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:33,620
Please remain calm and exit the station.

319
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:42,430
Show your face, you son of a bitch!

320
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:22,610
I know you're in here, kid!

321
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:28,080
Show me your face, you coward!

322
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:39,530
You got nowhere to
run, man. You hear me?

323
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,000
There's nothing down here for you?

324
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:43,350
Is that all you see?

325
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,510
Huh? Darkness?

326
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,850
You listen to me, you son of a bitch.

327
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,900
You get your ass off those tracks and
you put your hands on top of your head.

328
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:14,410
Do it now. Do it now!

329
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:19,260
- you will lose in the end.
- shut up. Shut your mouth.

330
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:21,030
You want to know why?

331
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,870
Because you fear what we embrace.

332
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,570
Get off the--no!
No, no, no!

333
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:33,780
- on 3--1, 2,
3. - got her.

334
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:34,590
Ok.

335
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,600
Ok, i'm gonna clamp that artery.

336
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:41,060
When i say move, move your hand and
get as far out of my way as you can.

337
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,510
- you got it?
- yep.

338
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,310
Ok, move. Ok.

339
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:49,280
I need to get a bag in and start getting
her pressure up. Get the gurney from the bus.

340
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:55,590
Yes, yes, i understand. Thank you.

341
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,520
Homeland security has poured tactical
teams into all of those locations.

342
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:04,240
Uh, swat, bomb techs, hrt, hazmat,
the works. They found nothing.

343
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,080
Reid.

344
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:08,930
All except one.

345
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,760
Kate's suv-- none of the
shootings were anywhere near it.

346
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,510
Maybe it's personal.

347
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,040
This death card they gave
us-- they delivered on it.

348
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,310
That's just it--
they haven't.

349
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,470
With a cell as large as this one
and multiple targets to choose from,

350
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,290
They target a single suv?

351
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:29,560
Where's the closest emergency room?

352
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,310
- st.barclay's.
- where?

353
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,530
- st.barclay's.
- and where is it?

354
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:36,210
It's 4 blocks uptown, one block east.

355
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,650
Where's the emergency entrance?

356
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:40,290
Under the hospital. Just
follow the signs to the e.r.

357
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,050
Ok.

358
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:47,840
Hey, look who's back. Hello.

359
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,340
Is she awake?

360
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,890
Is that aaron?

361
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,240
- are you aaron?
- yeah.

362
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,550
- kate, we made it.
- thank you.

363
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:01,280
Don't thank me. Thank your
partner. He did it all.

364
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,010
- what's this?
- secret service.

365
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,970
We're directing all
emergencies over to lenox hill.

366
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,290
I'm ssa hotchner. I
have ssa joyner on board.

367
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,340
She was injured in the
bomb blast at federal plaza.

368
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,570
Credentials.

369
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,410
They're in my jacket at federal plaza.

370
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,690
I appreciate that, agent, but this
hospital is on a strict bypass.

371
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,650
What
is--what's that?

372
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:30,170
It means the hospital is closed.

373
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:33,260
We're redirecting all
emergencies to lenox hill.

374
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,550
She's not gonna make it to lenox hill.

375
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,520
I'm losing her!

376
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:39,030
She's crashing! She's crashing!

377
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,720
- please.
- i'm losing her.

378
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,160
Open it up.

379
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:46,160
His is delta 2. I need
immediate e.r.attendance.

380
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,890
What do you got?

381
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,970
Bp 50 over 30, she's bradycardic
with severe spinal injury.

382
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:57,380
Get her in the bag.
Get in the crash cart.

383
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,910
Let's get him on a gurney.

384
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:36,680
- Morgan's safe.
- good. Thank god.

385
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:38,740
This is the unsub morgan
chased into the subway.

386
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,770
This is the one prentiss shot.

387
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,180
Garcia's running them through vicap.

388
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:44,990
These are smart, well-educated kids,
hand-picked and trained to be martyrs.

389
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
They're not gonna be in any government
file and they won't have rap sheets.

390
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,930
Hotch and kate are at
st. Barclay's hospital.

391
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,910
How are they?

392
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,050
Well, hotch is in the
e.r., kate's in surgery.

393
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,360
Morgan's on his way down there now.

394
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:57,520
The media's reporting this as a
failed attack on 26 federal plaza.

395
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:58,200
Well, it's not.

396
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:00,910
They're not the only ones. Homeland
security feels the same way.

397
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,620
They're wrong.

398
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:05,510
They found nothing at any of the sites that
you told them that these guys were targeting.

399
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,090
Maybe this thing is over.

400
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:10,180
Or maybe that's exactly
what they want us to think.

401
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:12,930
As soon as the bomb techs identify
the device, i want to know about it.

402
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:13,590
Of course.

403
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,180
Can you get in tighter on the bomber?

404
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:18,850
Here, in his hand. He's
using his cell phone.

405
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,790
Joyner and hotch approach the van.

406
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,200
Why not wait until they both get in?

407
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,920
Guess he figured he was close enough.

408
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,750
Wouldn't you wait until they were in it?

409
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,680
- so far these guys have accomplished nothing.
- nothing?

410
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,860
My partner was
shot--cooper?

411
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,530
8 innocent people were killed.

412
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,630
2 agents blown up.

413
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,470
Not to mention emily's suicide
by cop. Is that not enough?

414
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,770
That was memorable.

415
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:44,060
This isn't.

416
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:47,710
Doc. Fbi.

417
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,980
How's aaron hotchner?

418
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:52,930
He's got acute acoustic trauma in his right
ear, and i pulled shrapnel from his leg.

419
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,150
Just lay down. Sir!

420
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,200
Agent hotchner, lie down.

421
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:59,840
- doctor, i'm all right.
- hotch, stop it. Just calm down.

422
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:01,540
- doc, i got it, ok?
- morgan, where's kate?

423
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,910
She's in surgery.

424
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,420
Where are my clothes, please?

425
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:06,950
Hotch, your go bag is on its way.

426
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:09,480
Has anything happened
since the first blast?

427
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:10,760
Nothing.

428
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:12,800
- sam?
- he's dead.

429
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:15,320
Morgan, the profile's wrong.

430
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:18,790
Everything--everything they've done so
far has appeared to be something it's not.

431
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,470
I don't follow.

432
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,280
The seemingly random acts of murder, the attempt
to hack into our security surveillance systems.

433
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:26,030
The suicide by cop to make us
all believe that it was over.

434
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,380
Don't forget the death card
telling us they know we're watching.

435
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,220
All diversions.

436
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:33,360
To ensure our attention and analysis of any given
situation would than incorrectly inform our profile.

437
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:35,730
So the first responders
were not the real target?

438
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,560
- hotch and kate were a diversion, too?
- from what?

439
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,790
Morgan. Hotch wants
you guys over there now.

440
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,130
What do we tell homeland security?

441
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:46,360
Tell them if they love this city as
much as you do to keep it locked down.

442
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:48,880
It's about to get hit.

443
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:56,420
Are you ok?

444
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,800
Yeah. I just want to
understand why i'm still alive.

445
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:01,530
I think the idea was
to maim, not to kill.

446
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,650
Did you identify sam, the bomber?

447
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:07,260
Garcia put sam and the other dead
unsub into every know database. Nothing.

448
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,800
We know how terror cells evolve.

449
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,800
They learn from one
campaign to the next.

450
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,020
How to stay off radar
like the london bombers.

451
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,770
Yeah, but they, uh, they
hit at 8:50 in the morning

452
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:19,110
With a series of coordinated blasts
aimed at london's transportation system,

453
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,860
And this cell targeted a lone suv where the
only people on the street are 2 federal agents.

454
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:26,010
It's not multiple
targets, it's one target.

455
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,580
One target, one bomb.

456
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:31,400
Garcia said the device was
placed under kate's suv.

457
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:33,180
It was likely made
using oxydizing agents,

458
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:36,720
Including chromates,peroxides,
perchlorates, chlorates, and red mercury,

459
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:39,150
All jammed into a device
no larger than a cell phone.

460
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,410
Imagine what a bomb the
size of an oil drum could do.

461
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:45,310
Yeah, but to make something that
big, you'd need a chemical engineer.

462
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:51,110
Like the recently deceased dr. Azahari
husin, asia's most-wanted bomb-maker?

463
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,170
Authorities dubbed him
the, uh, demolition man.

464
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,250
He treated each bomb like a work of art.

465
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,320
One wrong move...

466
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:05,340
He becomes a victim of his own creation.

467
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:10,430
He'll be more revered than all of the
people who died as a result of his devices.

468
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,360
Stop the bomber, stop the bomb.

469
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:15,020
To do that, we need to know how
they would deploy something that big.

470
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,900
Hotch.

471
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,540
- did you ever find sam's cell phone?
- yes.

472
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:29,610
- did he call 911?
- no.

473
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,860
He dialed one number 6
times every few minutes.

474
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:33,150
It was a disposable cell.

475
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,870
Garcia tracked the number, but it
went dead minutes after sam died.

476
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,380
Whoever had it destroyed it.

477
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:39,950
Well, if he didn't have a
secondary device to detonate,

478
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,230
There's only one reason
that he stayed with us.

479
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,530
To make sure the ambulance got to you.

480
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:48,040
And in a city on lockdown, an ambulance
with its siren blaring and lights on,

481
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:52,500
It's gonna make it through every
roadblock virtually uncontested.

482
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:54,810
This hospital is on a strict bypass.

483
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:55,760
What
is--what's that?

484
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:58,270
It means the hospital is closed.

485
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,140
- and straight into a hospital with a bypass order on it.
- what?

486
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:03,230
Secret service has a
bypass on this hospital.

487
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,220
Secret service? Who are they protecting?

488
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,550
That's who sam was calling,
the paramedic on the ambulance.

489
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,680
The ambulance which i drove in here.

490
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:12,860
This hospital is their target. Let's go.

491
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,570
Who you got in here?

492
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,740
Why is that information
important to you?

493
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,440
The ambulance i drove in
here-- where is it now?

494
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:15,300
- in the basement. Why?
- there's a bomb in it.

495
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,120
- what?
- it's rigged.

496
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:18,590
It's rigged to assassinate
whoever it is you're protecting.

497
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,970
You need to get them and everyone
else out of here right now.

498
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:23,000
We can't do that. He's
undergoing surgery as we speak.

499
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:26,070
The paramedic i came in
with-- do you have eyes on him?

500
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,240
That a cell in his hands?

501
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:30,830
Garcia, can you remote access the cell phone
grid i'm in and jam all the frequencies?

502
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,820
Yeah, i can, but only for
a short period of time.

503
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:34,820
There's a bomb in the
basement of this building.

504
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:35,790
I'm on it.

505
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,830
Ok, we need to access and pinpoint the
3 closest cell towers to the location

506
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,620
And then disrupt the satellite feeds to
them and we need to do it fast. Here we go.

507
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,020
Look, he's coming back.

508
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:49,220
He's gonna detonate the
bomb manually if he has to.

509
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,090
Where did morgan go?

510
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,070
He went to find the ambulance.

511
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,040
- alone?
- let's head down.

512
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:55,850
Call air charlie one. Move echo one to
the roof as soon as he's out of surgery.

513
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:59,670
Air-vac him out of here. The rest
of us, we'll take the elevators.

514
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,340
Morgan?

515
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,720
Yeah, baby.

516
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:15,910
- you sound stressed.
- do i?

517
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,280
Where are you?

518
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,970
Not where i want to be right now.

519
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:36,800
Garcia, take this down for me. Fdny 108.

520
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:38,450
That's an ambulance.So you ok?

521
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,590
Yeah.I'm fine.

522
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,320
Just track it for me.

1
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,370
- he's going to the basement.
- stairs.

3
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:12,130
Oh, my god.

4
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:15,820
Garcia, how long can you keep jamming the cell phone lines?

5
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,450
Uh, a few minutes, max.
Why?

7
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,580
'Cause i'm gonna have to get this ambulance out of here.

8
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,630
Or you could just evacuate the building like everybody else.

9
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,580
No.
As soon as the airways are clear, this thing's going up.

11
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:28,650
Going up?Oh, my god, that's like 3 minutes, 

12
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:31,080
'Cause that's when the satellite moves position.

13
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:42,460
Come on.

14
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,050
Garcia, listen to me.

15
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,990
I need you to find an area of town i can drive this thing, 

16
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,360
And you tell everybody, you hear me, everybody that i'm coming.

17
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:53,020
Come on, babe.

18
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:56,000
Do it!
Go!

20
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:59,030
All right, talk to me, garcia.

21
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,230
Ok.
Head north...

23
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:04,360
And floor it.
I'll tell you where to turn.

25
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,340
What was that?

26
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,660
It was nothing.
Just talk to me!

28
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:16,330
No!
No!
Nooo!

31
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:22,380
Noooo!

32
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:58,230
Prentiss.

33
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,370
How am i doing, garcia?

34
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,240
How's he doing?

35
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,670
One minute, 50 seconds.

36
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,890
Why does it always have to be you?

37
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,980
Why do you always have to do this?

38
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,020
{\a6}<i>NO SIGNAL</i>

39
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,570
Come on.
Come on!

41
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,230
Derek, you don't have much time.

42
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,260
Please be smart about this.

43
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,300
Signal's coming back online.

44
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:53,030
30 seconds to full coverage.

45
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,050
Derek, drive to the opening and then get the hell out.

46
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,890
- there's something i really want you to know, garcia.
- 20 seconds.

48
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,040
Save it.
Just get out.

50
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:01,120
- no, no, no, i'm not quite there yet.
- 10...

52
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:02,430
- morgan...
- just listen to me.

54
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,970
- 9...
8...
- morgan, please.

57
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,110
You know what you are, garcia?

58
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:10,060
{\a6}<i>CALL CONNECTER</i>

59
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:13,080
- we just lost tracking.
- morgan!

61
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,190
Derek?

62
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,350
Fbi.

63
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:52,490
Put it down.
It's over.

65
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:14,620
Garcia...

66
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:17,500
I'll tell you what you are to me.

67
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:21,340
You're my god-given solace.

68
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,880
Woman, you promise me one thing...

69
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,370
Whatever happens...

70
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:30,190
Don't you ever stop talking to me.

71
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:33,110
I can't right now 'cause i'm mad at you.

72
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,640
I can wait.

73
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:41,000
What's happening?
Where's the surgeon?

75
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:46,520
We did all that we could.

76
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,130
I'm so sorry.

77
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,400
I'm telling you, we're gonna get caught.

78
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:49,890
Come on, kid, we're cops.

79
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:53,340
Smoking in a hospital is a federal offense.

80
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,720
You're on your own, kid.

81
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,790
I see the wife and kids came for a visit.

82
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,820
Have you told them you started smoking again?

83
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:10,020
Give me a break.
I just got shot.

85
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,490
Now i'm standing in front of a beautiful woman in this ridiculous garb with a...

86
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:18,300
I.
V.
And a catheter connected to my...
Skididdibup.

90
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,480
Could've told me you were coming.

91
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:23,610
Yeah, i wasn't going to and i...

92
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:26,060
I thought i'd drop in...

93
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:29,450
- i'm on my way to the airport now.
- yeah.

95
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:37,230
Sorry to hear about agent joyner.

96
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,080
And hotchner-- is he ok?

97
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:43,120
Uh, he can't fly for a little bit.
His ears are...
But he's gonna be fine.

100
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:46,780
Um, so--ok, i brought this for you.
For you and your family.

102
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:50,370
I'm told they are great seats.

103
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,530
You didn't have to.

104
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:54,690
I know.
I wanted to.

106
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,430
Could just as easily have been me.

107
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,280
Well...
I'm glad it wasn't.

109
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,400
Got a plane to catch, so...
Take care, cooper.

111
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,800
Mets tickets?

112
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:20,020
Most people assume i'm a yankees fan.

113
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:23,200
I'm not most people.

114
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:31,120
Nope.
No, that girl is not.

116
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:38,340
Thanks.

117
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,790
Got it.
I'm your ride.

119
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,710
I thought agent davis was driving me.

120
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,970
She was.
I had her reassigned.

122
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,530
Don't you have something better to do?

123
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:51,550
Than to annoy you for 3 hours?
Hell, no.

125
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,710
- give me the keys.
- not a chance, hotch.

127
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:56,560
Let's go.

128
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:03,510
So did we ever find out who the secret service had in the hospital?

129
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,300
Does it matter?

130
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:09,140
No, i guess it doesn't.

131
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:14,110
Quantico's requested you transfer to run the new york office.

132
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,350
Hotch, they haven't even buried her yet.

133
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,500
We're at war.
Things change.

135
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:21,230
Don't i need your recommendation?

136
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,050
You didn't give it, did you?

137
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:34,820
Your actions, as incredibly brave as they were...

138
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:38,780
Would still be actions of an agent who doesn't truly trust anyone.

139
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:42,020
Hotch, i did it for this team.

140
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:44,910
My opinion doesn't matter.
Job's yours if you want it.

142
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:49,130
Hotch.
Your opinion matters to me.

144
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:55,420
My life matters to me, and i have and always will entrust you with it.

145
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:01,140
Would you do the same for me?

146
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,050
Still want to drive?
