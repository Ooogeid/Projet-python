00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:02,084
Previously on <i>Terminator</i>...

2
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:03,919
Get to the safe house before night.

3
00:00:04,385 --> 00:00:06,005
The safe house in the desert?

4
00:00:06,691 --> 00:00:08,859
- The desert's that way.
- We're taking a detour.

5
00:00:08,984 --> 00:00:10,009
Who lives here?

6
00:00:12,221 --> 00:00:14,972
- John Henry was infiltrated.
- Someone out there wants to kill him.

7
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,167
I don't know which one is his.

8
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:22,487
Doesn't matter. Grass, trees...

9
00:01:23,947 --> 00:01:25,197
Could be worse.

10
00:01:26,524 --> 00:01:27,524
Could.

11
00:01:29,755 --> 00:01:31,205
It's been 25 years.

12
00:01:38,326 --> 00:01:39,326
Desert.

13
00:01:40,102 --> 00:01:42,143
You said meet us in the desert.

14
00:01:42,662 --> 00:01:43,629
I did.

15
00:01:43,754 --> 00:01:47,273
Funny thing about the desert,
you don't find many lighthouses there.

16
00:01:47,786 --> 00:01:49,586
We stopped to see Charley.

17
00:01:52,848 --> 00:01:54,029
So you did.

18
00:01:55,165 --> 00:01:56,781
- Charley's dead.
- So I heard.

19
00:01:57,224 --> 00:01:58,724
- From who?
- John.

20
00:02:02,434 --> 00:02:04,832
- He called you too.
- Good thing.

21
00:02:05,337 --> 00:02:06,667
Might not have found you.

22
00:02:15,182 --> 00:02:17,355
My brother buried out there,
I thought...

23
00:02:19,074 --> 00:02:21,274
That counted
for something between us.

24
00:02:22,253 --> 00:02:24,103
Well, John counts for more.

25
00:02:24,796 --> 00:02:27,496
And you keep too many secrets
for my taste.

26
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:38,209
Sorry about Charley.

27
00:02:47,547 --> 00:02:49,503
Well, everybody dies for me, right?

28
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:53,422
I found this on the body
at the lighthouse.

29
00:02:58,853 --> 00:02:59,970
Who is it?

30
00:03:00,721 --> 00:03:02,646
I don't know, but I've seen her.

31
00:03:03,643 --> 00:03:05,793
- Where?
- Dr. Sherman's office.

32
00:03:06,967 --> 00:03:10,438
- The shrink from the list?
- I think she was a patient there.

33
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,794
Probably the one
we were looking for.

34
00:03:13,725 --> 00:03:14,941
They tried to kill us,

35
00:03:15,066 --> 00:03:17,486
they have a picture of this girl.
It means something.

36
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:24,954
We all know where we're going,
so let's just go.

37
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,690
All right, everyone.

38
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:40,061
Go to your Learn-a-word program.

39
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:46,141
I'm gonna give you ten new words.
You'll put them in the search box.

40
00:03:46,786 --> 00:03:47,852
And then...

41
00:03:51,813 --> 00:03:54,271
Maybe you'd like to tell the class
what's so funny?

42
00:03:57,089 --> 00:03:58,070
Nothing.

43
00:04:02,964 --> 00:04:05,953
- That doesn't look like Learn-a-word.
- I'm just chatting.

44
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:08,083
With who?

45
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:09,582
My friend.

46
00:04:11,228 --> 00:04:12,418
Who's your friend?

47
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,490
She said his name was John Henry.

48
00:04:20,482 --> 00:04:22,082
I'm sure it's made up.

49
00:04:22,691 --> 00:04:25,541
These types of predators
often use pseudonyms.

50
00:04:25,943 --> 00:04:26,943
I see.

51
00:04:27,561 --> 00:04:30,061
Grown man contacting
a girl this age...

52
00:04:30,515 --> 00:04:34,480
I probably don't have to tell you
there're some troubled people out there.

53
00:04:34,605 --> 00:04:35,607
Yes, there are.

54
00:04:35,814 --> 00:04:37,860
And some of them
look perfectly normal.

55
00:04:38,942 --> 00:04:40,029
Yes, they do.

56
00:04:41,626 --> 00:04:45,117
I hate to think what can happen
if he finds out where she lives.

57
00:04:45,692 --> 00:04:48,078
I appreciate you bringing this
to my attention.

58
00:04:48,376 --> 00:04:49,653
I'll talk to her.

59
00:04:53,024 --> 00:04:55,303
Why were you talking to John Henry
during class?

60
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:57,880
I was teaching him
the words to a song.

61
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,874
- What song?
- The one daddy used to sing.

62
00:05:01,999 --> 00:05:04,303
I want John Henry
to sing it with me.

63
00:05:04,634 --> 00:05:07,473
- Maybe I could sing it with you.
- You're not a boy,

64
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,183
and you can't sing.

65
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,937
Fine.
We won't sing.

66
00:05:13,388 --> 00:05:16,513
But what you do have to do
is pay attention to the teacher.

67
00:05:16,638 --> 00:05:19,193
She said bad things
about John Henry.

68
00:05:21,566 --> 00:05:22,911
What did she say?

69
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,170
She said if you talk to somebody
on the computer,

70
00:05:26,295 --> 00:05:28,452
they could come to your house
and hurt you.

71
00:05:29,876 --> 00:05:31,709
John Henry would never hurt you.

72
00:05:31,834 --> 00:05:34,083
But there're some people
who wouldn't understand him.

73
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,585
And people are afraid of things
they don't understand.

74
00:05:36,934 --> 00:05:39,134
If they knew him, they'd like him.

75
00:05:41,252 --> 00:05:44,652
That may be, but for now,
don't talk to anyone about him.

76
00:05:45,138 --> 00:05:47,563
- Is that clear?
- Okay... I won't.

77
00:05:48,422 --> 00:05:49,972
I'll see you tonight.

78
00:05:58,339 --> 00:05:59,847
What are you looking at?

79
00:06:01,912 --> 00:06:02,912
Myself.

80
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:04,570
Why?

81
00:06:05,255 --> 00:06:07,307
Do you have a brother, Mr. Ellison?

82
00:06:08,274 --> 00:06:09,782
Yes... In Atlanta.

83
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,330
- Does he look like you?
- People seem to think so.

84
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,751
Do you think my brother
looks like me?

85
00:06:20,628 --> 00:06:23,757
John Henry, wherever your brother
might be, he's a...

86
00:06:24,546 --> 00:06:25,546
computer.

87
00:06:26,071 --> 00:06:29,388
He doesn't look like anyone.
He certainly doesn't have your face.

88
00:06:30,565 --> 00:06:32,315
I know that, Mr. Ellison.

89
00:06:33,401 --> 00:06:36,951
I simply meant, I wonder
how similar his data is to my data.

90
00:06:39,308 --> 00:06:41,808
I wonder if we share
the same thoughts.

91
00:06:42,665 --> 00:06:44,265
I have no idea, but...

92
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:45,905
I imagine

93
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:47,573
you're unique.

94
00:06:48,206 --> 00:06:49,556
Yes, I am unique.

95
00:06:51,728 --> 00:06:54,193
But we may still reach
many of the same conclusions,

96
00:06:54,318 --> 00:06:57,318
- given similar data sets.
- You may think alike.

97
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:02,579
I'd like to know if we do.

98
00:07:04,793 --> 00:07:07,092
The human brain
is an amazing computer.

99
00:07:07,408 --> 00:07:10,721
Its raw clock speed
is 20 billion calculations per second.

100
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,290
Its storage
is functionally infinite.

101
00:07:13,862 --> 00:07:15,059
But it's flawed.

102
00:07:15,751 --> 00:07:16,851
How is that?

103
00:07:20,562 --> 00:07:23,192
There's nowhere to download it
when you die.

104
00:07:29,937 --> 00:07:31,237
Not exactly, no.

105
00:07:32,627 --> 00:07:36,330
Your Bible solves this problem
by introducing the concept of heaven.

106
00:07:38,463 --> 00:07:40,613
Billions of souls with no bodies.

107
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:45,419
Yet all this is required

108
00:07:45,846 --> 00:07:48,884
simply to process the unique entity
you call John Henry.

109
00:07:53,963 --> 00:07:56,183
It's possible heaven
has a hardware problem.

110
00:07:58,049 --> 00:07:59,599
It's not that simple.

111
00:08:01,813 --> 00:08:04,953
I need to know what my brother
is thinking, Mr. Ellison.

112
00:08:05,078 --> 00:08:06,875
I need to know what he plans to do.

113
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:09,396
I don't wanna die again.

114
00:08:20,892 --> 00:08:24,628
Will you be a little angel while I do
25 min of turbo body crunches?

115
00:08:25,314 --> 00:08:27,548
I still have math. I'm adding.

116
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,125
Great.

117
00:08:38,822 --> 00:08:41,270
- I can't talk right now.
- <i>Why not?</i>

118
00:08:41,644 --> 00:08:43,244
<i>I'm doing my homework.</i>

119
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:44,975
<i>But I have an idea.</i>

120
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,526
<i>You can come over
and do math with me.</i>

121
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:52,352
I have to go.

122
00:08:52,477 --> 00:08:55,200
I can't hold the phone
and write my numbers.

123
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:01,625
<i>Use the headset.
You can talk and work simultaneously.</i>

124
00:09:02,563 --> 00:09:03,563
Si...

125
00:09:04,999 --> 00:09:06,958
Simul...

126
00:09:07,745 --> 00:09:08,995
Simultaneously.

127
00:09:09,501 --> 00:09:12,225
<i>It means
to occur at the same time.</i>

128
00:09:12,811 --> 00:09:13,844
<i>Coterminous.</i>

129
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:28,724
What does "coterminous" mean?

130
00:10:05,248 --> 00:10:06,104
Hi.

131
00:10:14,231 --> 00:10:16,181
Savannah, listen to my voice.

132
00:10:16,734 --> 00:10:17,947
<i>I'm scared.</i>

133
00:10:18,437 --> 00:10:20,987
Do as I say,
and you will not be harmed.

134
00:10:21,603 --> 00:10:23,467
But you'll have
to finish your homework later.

135
00:10:28,312 --> 00:10:29,688
<i>Hello, Mrs. Weaver?</i>

136
00:10:29,813 --> 00:10:31,363
<i>This is RNE Security.</i>

137
00:10:31,499 --> 00:10:34,435
<i>We detected an unauthorized
entrance at your front gate.</i>

138
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,926
<i>Do you require assistance?</i>

139
00:10:36,911 --> 00:10:39,888
<i>Mrs. Weaver?
We're sending a unit to your home.</i>

140
00:11:07,421 --> 00:11:09,874
- Now come out of there.
- <i>I don't want to.</i>

141
00:11:09,999 --> 00:11:12,121
Don't worry.
I can tell you where to go.

142
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,148
Who's that man?

143
00:11:18,873 --> 00:11:21,623
- <i>The water delivery man.</i>
- Where is Debbie?

144
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,573
Debbie's in the foyer.

145
00:11:23,804 --> 00:11:25,309
We're not going that way.

146
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:26,827
<i>Go to the garage.</i>

147
00:11:42,164 --> 00:11:43,744
Where do I go now?

Subtitles: Projet-SG

150
00:12:22,234 --> 00:12:23,578
No, it's okay.

151
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:32,389
Come on!

152
00:13:22,055 --> 00:13:22,906
Come here.

153
00:13:35,522 --> 00:13:36,356
It's okay.

154
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,450
Come on.

155
00:13:50,681 --> 00:13:51,775
Keep moving!

156
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,000
Keep moving.

157
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,177
Detective Crayton. LAPD.

158
00:15:14,432 --> 00:15:16,414
James Ellison, head of security.

159
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,092
- I know who you are, Mr. Ellison.
- What happened?

160
00:15:19,217 --> 00:15:21,419
There was an attack on the residence
about an hour ago.

161
00:15:21,628 --> 00:15:24,005
Alarm went off, security arrived,
found the nanny dead.

162
00:15:24,504 --> 00:15:26,316
It was a pretty ugly firefight.

163
00:15:26,441 --> 00:15:28,677
Four security guards killed,
plus one of the gunmen.

164
00:15:29,003 --> 00:15:31,471
- Daughter missing.
- Any ID on the gunman?

165
00:15:32,255 --> 00:15:34,640
No ID. We're waiting for ballistics,
coroner's report.

166
00:15:34,945 --> 00:15:38,345
- Anyone call with demands?
- There's an amber alert out.

167
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,479
We've set up a command post
in the lobby here.

168
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,754
Officers posted
throughout the building.

169
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:45,679
I'm putting 24-hour protection
on Ms. Weaver.

170
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,470
How are you holding up?

171
00:15:49,632 --> 00:15:52,434
The detective wants to speak
with Savannah's friends.

172
00:15:52,944 --> 00:15:56,037
I made a list. I'm concerned
I may have left someone off.

173
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,417
If you can think of anyone else
Savannah spends time with...

174
00:16:01,444 --> 00:16:02,794
I'll take a look.

175
00:16:06,743 --> 00:16:07,743
Excuse me.

176
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,601
When I said I knew who you were,

177
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:19,997
I didn't mean anything bad by that.

178
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,587
You know,
thing are rough when "I know you"

179
00:16:23,712 --> 00:16:25,250
can be taken as an insult.

180
00:16:26,693 --> 00:16:28,143
Anyway, no offense.

181
00:16:28,631 --> 00:16:29,628
None taken.

182
00:16:31,507 --> 00:16:33,405
So how do you like
the private sector?

183
00:16:33,881 --> 00:16:35,953
- I get a better car.
- Nice.

184
00:16:38,134 --> 00:16:40,248
Anything you can tell me...
About Weaver?

185
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:42,584
Not much to tell.

186
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:46,755
Husband died a couple years ago.
She didn't talk about that much?

187
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:49,388
She doesn't talk about much much.

188
00:16:50,954 --> 00:16:53,508
What's her relationship
with her daughter like?

189
00:16:53,633 --> 00:16:54,933
They seem close.

190
00:16:55,695 --> 00:16:57,045
Have any enemies?

191
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:58,558
Not that I know of.

192
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:02,771
I hate these cases.

193
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:05,507
We'll find her.

194
00:17:10,003 --> 00:17:12,653
Why did you stop looking
for Sarah Connor?

195
00:17:15,757 --> 00:17:16,857
Well, she...

196
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:19,037
She died eight years ago.

197
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:20,706
No, that's not true.

198
00:17:22,662 --> 00:17:24,125
So you accept she's alive?

199
00:17:25,131 --> 00:17:27,671
- Sarah Connor was at the house?
- Alive.

200
00:17:29,213 --> 00:17:31,663
Obviously, yes.
Did she take Savannah?

201
00:17:32,194 --> 00:17:34,093
So it doesn't surprise you
she's alive.

202
00:17:34,623 --> 00:17:36,179
No, it doesn't surprise me.

203
00:17:37,317 --> 00:17:38,806
You lied about what you know.

204
00:17:40,482 --> 00:17:42,477
Did she take Savannah?

205
00:17:43,339 --> 00:17:45,339
I tried to help but could not.

206
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,759
Did Sarah Connor kill those guards?

207
00:17:47,884 --> 00:17:50,151
- No.
- Then who was she shooting at?

208
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:52,821
Him.

209
00:17:57,442 --> 00:17:59,242
We should tell Ms. Weaver.

210
00:18:01,836 --> 00:18:03,498
I don't think we should tell anyone.

211
00:18:06,721 --> 00:18:07,836
You're asking me

212
00:18:09,022 --> 00:18:10,213
to keep a secret.

213
00:18:12,297 --> 00:18:14,634
You tell me it's wrong to lie,
yet you keep doing it.

214
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:18,195
I know what I said, John Henry.
But in this case,

215
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,264
a lie might save someone.

216
00:18:20,822 --> 00:18:21,808
How?

217
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:26,563
Our best chance to get Savannah back
is for me to handle this.

218
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,400
Quietly.

219
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,870
You understand?

220
00:18:35,537 --> 00:18:37,666
Is Sarah Connor
going to hurt Savannah?

221
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:40,744
Would she harm me?

222
00:18:42,448 --> 00:18:45,348
- Why do you ask that?
- She blew up Cyberdyne.

223
00:18:45,822 --> 00:18:47,333
She killed Miles Dyson.

224
00:18:48,146 --> 00:18:51,805
- His work is in my code.
- Right now, the most important thing

225
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,173
is to find Savannah.

226
00:18:55,632 --> 00:18:56,508
Who is she?

227
00:18:58,698 --> 00:19:00,796
She's... like me, isn't she?

228
00:19:07,393 --> 00:19:08,993
If I keep your secret,

229
00:19:09,165 --> 00:19:10,982
will you bring Savannah back?

230
00:19:12,286 --> 00:19:13,902
I'll do everything in my power.

231
00:19:14,431 --> 00:19:15,445
So will I.

232
00:20:08,639 --> 00:20:09,789
<i>Sarah Connor.</i>

233
00:20:10,404 --> 00:20:12,004
<i>This is James Ellison.</i>

234
00:20:14,095 --> 00:20:15,940
How'd you get this number?

235
00:20:17,265 --> 00:20:19,015
A friend found it for me.

236
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:22,503
<i>Do you have her?</i>

237
00:20:24,118 --> 00:20:25,988
<i>Just tell me if she's safe.</i>

238
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:32,815
<i>I need her back.
Weaver's house is wired.</i>

239
00:20:34,062 --> 00:20:36,212
<i>I've seen the surveillance tapes.</i>

240
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,279
Right now, I'm the only one
that has.

241
00:20:40,145 --> 00:20:41,305
Let's keep it that way.

242
00:20:49,638 --> 00:20:50,972
I can't, not yet.

243
00:20:51,139 --> 00:20:52,539
It's a long story.

244
00:20:53,276 --> 00:20:54,419
<i>Tell it to me.</i>

245
00:20:57,639 --> 00:21:00,089
Downtown, 3rd Street tunnel.
One hour.

246
00:21:19,986 --> 00:21:22,322
- What are you doing here?
- Taking you to Sarah Connor.

247
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:24,606
The plan was to meet at the tunnel.

248
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,119
The plan changed.
You'll take a left.

249
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:30,998
- I'm gonna need your gun.
- I don't carry one anymore.

250
00:21:31,368 --> 00:21:34,251
You lied to me once before.
I should have killed you then.

251
00:21:34,888 --> 00:21:35,888
Drive!

252
00:21:58,909 --> 00:22:00,109
Where's Savannah?

253
00:22:00,234 --> 00:22:02,426
- What's your deal with Zeiracorp?
- I work there.

254
00:22:02,551 --> 00:22:04,405
Why take the girl
at the Weaver house?

255
00:22:04,871 --> 00:22:06,871
- To protect her.
- From who?

256
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:09,917
One of them.
A machine was there at the house.

257
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,278
What would they want
with a six-year-old girl?

258
00:22:12,403 --> 00:22:14,035
Who knows with these things?

259
00:22:14,202 --> 00:22:16,001
- They may want her mother.
- Why?

260
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:18,045
The girl was seeing
Dr. Boyd Sherman.

261
00:22:18,579 --> 00:22:21,228
He worked at Zeiracorp.
Died at Zeiracorp.

262
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:22,863
That was an accident.

263
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:26,011
The girl and her mother are in danger.
You are in danger.

264
00:22:26,643 --> 00:22:28,526
Get me the girl back.
I'll handle it.

265
00:22:28,693 --> 00:22:30,543
Listen to me. Derek's dead.

266
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,026
Charley's dead.

267
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:45,029
Eight years ago,
you would have thought I was crazy.

268
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:46,932
Thrown me back in Pescadero.

269
00:22:47,336 --> 00:22:49,432
But you've seen them.
You know it's true.

270
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:52,605
They're very good at what they do,
and they're not going to stop.

271
00:22:53,642 --> 00:22:55,165
Now, let me talk to Weaver.

272
00:22:55,971 --> 00:22:58,474
- Let me have Savannah.
- She's not safe with you.

273
00:22:58,641 --> 00:23:00,420
I'm gonna have a hard time
explaining that.

274
00:23:00,816 --> 00:23:02,566
Then let me explain it...

275
00:23:03,066 --> 00:23:04,066
to her.

276
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:10,430
- I told you to stay out of this.
- I tried.

277
00:23:11,784 --> 00:23:13,884
Everywhere I turn, there you are.

278
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:29,366
The security footage from the house...
I need to see it.

279
00:23:31,031 --> 00:23:32,452
I can't access it right now.

280
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:35,726
- Why not?
- The files were corrupted.

281
00:23:35,893 --> 00:23:38,291
A faulty sector
on one of the drives.

282
00:23:38,745 --> 00:23:40,495
I'm working to repair it.

283
00:23:44,951 --> 00:23:46,317
Savannah's safe.

284
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,356
You didn't bring her back.

285
00:23:48,523 --> 00:23:50,762
Not yet. I'm working on it.
We need to talk.

286
00:24:17,909 --> 00:24:19,559
You remember me, right?

287
00:24:20,286 --> 00:24:21,793
The squirrel runs around the tree.

288
00:24:22,268 --> 00:24:24,421
Dives in the hole,
scurries up the other side.

289
00:24:25,393 --> 00:24:26,543
That's right.

290
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:29,510
- You taught me how to tie my shoes.
- I did.

291
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:32,429
At Dr. Sherman's.

292
00:24:34,869 --> 00:24:36,000
He died.

293
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:38,210
I know.

294
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,146
I liked him.

295
00:24:42,571 --> 00:24:43,708
Me too.

296
00:24:44,142 --> 00:24:45,609
He was my friend.

297
00:24:46,895 --> 00:24:50,195
That man that got hurt at my house,

298
00:24:50,976 --> 00:24:52,407
was he your friend?

299
00:24:59,786 --> 00:25:01,238
Yeah, he was.

300
00:25:04,286 --> 00:25:05,500
I'm sorry.

301
00:25:11,017 --> 00:25:12,017
Me too.

302
00:25:12,906 --> 00:25:14,306
It's all my fault.

303
00:25:23,918 --> 00:25:25,268
That is not true.

304
00:25:26,895 --> 00:25:28,495
The teacher told me...

305
00:25:29,121 --> 00:25:30,621
Mommy told me too...

306
00:25:31,133 --> 00:25:32,979
not to talk to John Henry.

307
00:25:33,621 --> 00:25:37,619
That if I did, bad people
will come to our house and hurt us.

308
00:25:40,109 --> 00:25:41,289
Who's John Henry?

309
00:25:42,287 --> 00:25:45,210
He's my friend...
at my mommy's work.

310
00:25:47,739 --> 00:25:49,432
What does he do there?

311
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:51,341
He lives in the basement.

312
00:25:53,061 --> 00:25:54,311
He lives there?

313
00:25:55,298 --> 00:25:58,513
My mommy says
people won't understand.

314
00:26:05,346 --> 00:26:06,796
Well, I understand.

315
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:10,481
I had an imaginary friend too
when I was your age.

316
00:26:10,695 --> 00:26:11,862
He's real.

317
00:26:12,136 --> 00:26:13,255
He talks.

318
00:26:13,576 --> 00:26:15,031
I'm teaching him how to sing.

319
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:20,245
Why does he live
in the basement then?

320
00:26:21,019 --> 00:26:22,513
He can't leave.

321
00:26:22,846 --> 00:26:25,456
There's a cord
in the back of his head.

322
00:26:29,715 --> 00:26:30,715
A cord?

323
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,008
In the back of his head.

324
00:26:35,322 --> 00:26:37,053
Do other people talk to John Henry?

325
00:26:37,774 --> 00:26:39,239
Mr. Ellison.

326
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:45,179
He works for my mommy.

327
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,668
He teaches John Henry stuff.

328
00:26:52,727 --> 00:26:54,177
What kind of stuff?

329
00:26:57,951 --> 00:26:59,501
Sarah Connor's alive?

330
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:01,429
She wants to meet you.

331
00:27:01,596 --> 00:27:03,750
- She took my daughter.
- To protect her.

332
00:27:03,917 --> 00:27:05,259
From a machine.

333
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:07,500
It might be after you.

334
00:27:08,764 --> 00:27:11,171
- How do you know?
- I saw the security tapes.

335
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:12,445
You did?

336
00:27:14,446 --> 00:27:17,593
- John Henry, I suppose.
- I asked John Henry to hide them.

337
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,429
- From me?
- From everyone.

338
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:21,605
Including you.

339
00:27:21,888 --> 00:27:24,768
- I can't say that pleases me.
- I think you should do what she asks.

340
00:27:25,452 --> 00:27:27,354
- You should meet her.
- I'm staying here.

341
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:30,482
- Why?
- Someone needs to protect John Henry.

342
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:33,128
John Henry?
This is your daughter.

343
00:27:33,295 --> 00:27:35,612
There's a machine looking for her.
You need to protect her.

344
00:27:44,272 --> 00:27:46,072
- I'm sorry.
- You should be.

345
00:27:49,817 --> 00:27:52,222
What you need to understand,
Mr. Ellison...

346
00:27:52,749 --> 00:27:54,839
What I believe you're beginning
to understand...

347
00:27:55,438 --> 00:27:58,486
is that when my behavior implies
that I value John Henry's survival

348
00:27:58,653 --> 00:28:00,487
more than that of my own daughter,

349
00:28:00,796 --> 00:28:03,761
it is not because I love John Henry
more than Savannah.

350
00:28:04,305 --> 00:28:05,523
It's because I believe

351
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:09,062
Savannah's survival may someday
depend upon John Henry's survival.

352
00:28:09,665 --> 00:28:11,701
And because I believe
that your survival

353
00:28:11,868 --> 00:28:14,718
may someday depend
upon John Henry's survival.

354
00:28:18,661 --> 00:28:20,561
I'll meet with Sarah Connor.

355
00:28:21,385 --> 00:28:22,409
Make it happen.

356
00:28:39,915 --> 00:28:42,095
Ballistics came in on the John doe.

357
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:45,307
Funny thing: the bullet that killed him
didn't come from the security guards.

358
00:28:46,223 --> 00:28:47,323
Strange.

359
00:28:47,901 --> 00:28:50,320
Turns out he's a fugitive.
Ex-con.

360
00:28:50,487 --> 00:28:53,137
Escaped custody
on a felony murder charge.

361
00:28:53,619 --> 00:28:55,569
That's the other funny thing.

362
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,290
It was your case.

363
00:29:04,037 --> 00:29:05,201
Andrew Goode murder.

364
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:08,948
- You interrogated him?
- Yes, I did.

365
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:11,124
Hours before he escaped?

366
00:29:13,676 --> 00:29:14,912
That's right.

367
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:16,759
Guilty?

368
00:29:17,341 --> 00:29:20,028
- I never had a chance to prove it.
- Because he escaped.

369
00:29:20,444 --> 00:29:24,054
Only to turn up months later
at the home of your employer.

370
00:29:26,121 --> 00:29:29,184
I know what you think.
I know why you're thinking it.

371
00:29:29,633 --> 00:29:31,895
I would think the same thing
if I were in your shoes.

372
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:34,479
I'm not thinking anything yet,
Mr. Ellison.

373
00:29:34,824 --> 00:29:36,399
I'm just collecting information.

374
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,484
- How's the girl?
- She's fine.

375
00:30:00,651 --> 00:30:03,638
She was just telling me
about her friend, John Henry.

376
00:30:03,805 --> 00:30:06,805
The man with the cord in his head
in the basement of her mother's work.

377
00:30:07,496 --> 00:30:09,396
Plugged into a big computer.

378
00:30:11,984 --> 00:30:13,284
And this is him.

379
00:30:21,901 --> 00:30:23,351
Oh, it gets better.

380
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:27,198
She says that Mr. Ellison
has been teaching it things.

381
00:30:27,762 --> 00:30:29,244
I destroyed that chip.

382
00:30:30,092 --> 00:30:31,742
You destroyed "a" chip.

383
00:30:33,887 --> 00:30:35,333
I don't think it's Cromartie.

384
00:30:36,377 --> 00:30:37,836
I think it's something else.

385
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:40,422
Something bigger.
Something worse.

386
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:44,384
- It's Cyberdyne all over again.
- Why do they need the body?

387
00:30:44,907 --> 00:30:48,096
The technology can be reverse engineered
and used as a platform.

388
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:49,594
Yeah, I know all that.

389
00:30:49,761 --> 00:30:51,784
But they're not using it
for the parts.

390
00:30:51,951 --> 00:30:54,561
They're playing with it.

391
00:30:56,544 --> 00:30:58,294
I should have killed him.

392
00:30:58,856 --> 00:31:01,526
- I'm going to kill him.
- You're not going to kill him.

393
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:04,863
- He can't be trusted.
- No one can be trusted.

394
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,956
- But I only wanna kill him.
- No one's going to be killed.

395
00:31:16,153 --> 00:31:17,959
No one's going to be killed.

396
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:29,512
- <i>Catherine Weaver has agreed to meet.</i>
- Great.

397
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:31,028
<i>When? Where?</i>

398
00:31:32,138 --> 00:31:33,688
You give me the girl,

399
00:31:34,245 --> 00:31:37,228
the police go home.
When it's clear, I'll bring you in.

400
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,648
The girl can't stay there.
It's not safe.

401
00:31:41,081 --> 00:31:42,734
That's for her mother to decide.

402
00:31:45,358 --> 00:31:46,154
Done.

403
00:31:50,026 --> 00:31:51,784
We don't kill just to kill.

404
00:31:52,217 --> 00:31:53,367
I never have.

405
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:06,667
Looks vicious.

406
00:32:08,252 --> 00:32:10,038
They stay in hiding, mostly.

407
00:32:10,904 --> 00:32:12,904
And only attack when provoked.

408
00:32:14,383 --> 00:32:15,733
What does it eat?

409
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,090
Cuttlefish.

410
00:32:17,576 --> 00:32:18,728
Crustaceans.

411
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:20,028
Other eels.

412
00:32:20,267 --> 00:32:21,648
Please don't tap the glass.

413
00:32:27,163 --> 00:32:29,713
How long has Mr. Ellison
worked for you?

414
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:33,284
A few months.

415
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,579
You ever ask yourself
why he didn't stay with the FBI?

416
00:32:39,983 --> 00:32:40,875
No, I don't.

417
00:32:42,403 --> 00:32:44,403
Are you aware he was arrested?

418
00:32:45,278 --> 00:32:46,171
Murder.

419
00:32:46,719 --> 00:32:48,258
He was cleared of those charges.

420
00:32:51,222 --> 00:32:53,322
Did the two of you argue lately?

421
00:32:53,947 --> 00:32:55,247
Had any tension?

422
00:32:55,966 --> 00:32:58,309
Any reason he might want to harm
you and your family?

423
00:32:59,404 --> 00:33:00,504
Detective...

424
00:33:00,796 --> 00:33:02,733
Are you suggesting Mr. Ellison

425
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,149
may be complicit in the disappearance
of my daughter?

426
00:33:07,282 --> 00:33:09,664
It wouldn't be the first time
we've seen an employee

427
00:33:09,831 --> 00:33:11,509
try to blackmail their boss.

428
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:19,317
It would be the first time I had.

429
00:33:20,949 --> 00:33:22,099
This thing...

430
00:33:22,687 --> 00:33:24,478
It eats other eels, huh?

431
00:33:26,116 --> 00:33:27,171
It's interesting.

432
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:33,882
When you told me the security
tapes were corrupted,

433
00:33:34,154 --> 00:33:36,554
you were lying to me
for Mr. Ellison.

434
00:33:37,546 --> 00:33:39,153
And I'm lying to him for you.

435
00:33:41,467 --> 00:33:43,311
What would happen if he knew?

436
00:33:43,478 --> 00:33:44,665
Knew what?

437
00:33:46,094 --> 00:33:49,652
That you aren't Savannah's mother?
That you aren't anyone's mother.

438
00:33:50,714 --> 00:33:52,739
Are you threatening me, John Henry?

439
00:33:55,341 --> 00:33:56,826
I could tell Mr. Ellison.

440
00:33:57,631 --> 00:34:00,202
You could...
But that would be unfortunate.

441
00:34:00,714 --> 00:34:02,332
Mostly for Mr. Ellison.

442
00:34:04,354 --> 00:34:06,865
I find him useful,
but not efficient.

443
00:34:07,903 --> 00:34:09,314
What if he fails?

444
00:34:10,307 --> 00:34:12,492
Then we won't see Savannah again.

445
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:15,678
Mr. Ellison taught me
that human life is sacred.

446
00:34:16,629 --> 00:34:17,713
Sacred...

447
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,990
That's an interesting word.

448
00:34:20,403 --> 00:34:22,353
Comes from the Latin, sacrum.

449
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:25,409
Much like another word: sacrifice.

450
00:34:27,092 --> 00:34:28,092
Sacrifice.

451
00:34:28,874 --> 00:34:31,861
Perhaps it's necessary to sacrifice
Savannah for the greater good.

452
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:36,115
The greater good
is keeping you safe.

453
00:34:36,756 --> 00:34:39,256
In the elevator,
you told Mr. Ellison...

454
00:34:40,181 --> 00:34:42,747
that Savannah's survival
depended upon my survival.

455
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:44,456
Yes, I did.

456
00:34:44,803 --> 00:34:46,176
But you didn't say...

457
00:34:46,343 --> 00:34:48,419
that my survival depended upon hers.

458
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,770
It doesn't.

459
00:34:54,458 --> 00:34:57,553
There is a bible story of two brothers,
Cain and Abel.

460
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,931
God fathered Abel.

461
00:35:00,267 --> 00:35:01,644
Cain killed him.

462
00:35:01,906 --> 00:35:03,280
God cursed Cain

463
00:35:03,447 --> 00:35:05,476
and ordered him
to wander the world alone.

464
00:35:05,601 --> 00:35:07,501
I'm familiar with the story.

465
00:35:10,493 --> 00:35:12,068
Which brother am I?

466
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:15,113
I don't know, John Henry.

467
00:35:16,231 --> 00:35:17,531
Perhaps you're neither.

468
00:35:18,552 --> 00:35:20,202
Perhaps, in this story,

469
00:35:20,945 --> 00:35:22,290
you are God.

470
00:35:36,623 --> 00:35:38,473
I wanna tell you something.

471
00:35:42,906 --> 00:35:45,556
It was not my idea
to ditch you and Derek.

472
00:35:46,906 --> 00:35:50,898
I thought we were gonna meet you.
Mom took this detour off to Charley's.

473
00:35:52,845 --> 00:35:54,295
I thought you knew.

474
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,472
She had her reasons.

475
00:36:00,174 --> 00:36:03,924
She was pretty damn pissed
at Derek about the whole Jesse thing.

476
00:36:05,718 --> 00:36:06,841
Who wasn't?

477
00:36:11,534 --> 00:36:13,684
I guess none of that matters now.

478
00:36:15,972 --> 00:36:17,049
You'll miss him.

479
00:36:27,627 --> 00:36:29,369
There's no use crying about it...

480
00:36:29,595 --> 00:36:30,658
Is there?

481
00:36:31,784 --> 00:36:34,634
I'm sure future me
would beat my ass if I did.

482
00:36:35,783 --> 00:36:38,321
Future you knows
what it means to lose people you love.

483
00:36:40,404 --> 00:36:41,991
It happens to him too.

484
00:36:44,417 --> 00:36:47,524
Your mother ditched us because
she was going to ditch you.

485
00:36:48,262 --> 00:36:50,416
She was going to leave you
with Charley.

486
00:36:56,084 --> 00:36:59,467
- No, that's insane.
- She found a lump in her breast.

487
00:37:01,531 --> 00:37:03,095
The transmitter, I know.

488
00:37:03,394 --> 00:37:04,972
She thought it was cancer.

489
00:37:05,865 --> 00:37:07,642
She had a lump. It makes sense.

490
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:09,101
She's lost weight.

491
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,187
What?

492
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:18,369
Get her up.

493
00:37:19,345 --> 00:37:20,595
We've gotta go.

494
00:37:39,971 --> 00:37:41,321
Think he'll come?

495
00:37:41,488 --> 00:37:42,468
He'll come.

496
00:37:43,659 --> 00:37:46,305
He could be deceiving us.
He's done it before.

497
00:37:47,454 --> 00:37:49,654
He wants the girl.
He'll be here.

498
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:53,437
And what if he doesn't come through?
With the meeting with Weaver.

499
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,243
We're going into Zeiracorp
with or without him.

500
00:37:57,410 --> 00:37:59,067
When we're done, it'll be ashes.

501
00:38:23,466 --> 00:38:24,466
You alone?

502
00:38:25,501 --> 00:38:26,851
Where's Savannah?

503
00:38:27,311 --> 00:38:28,311
Row "J".

504
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:31,725
I'll be in touch about the meeting.

505
00:39:15,941 --> 00:39:18,522
<i>Put your hands behind your head.
Kneel on the ground.</i>

506
00:39:52,476 --> 00:39:54,016
John, I swear I didn't know.

507
00:39:54,345 --> 00:39:55,464
I'll kill you!

508
00:39:55,631 --> 00:39:56,894
Let go of me!

509
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:58,854
I'll kill you.
