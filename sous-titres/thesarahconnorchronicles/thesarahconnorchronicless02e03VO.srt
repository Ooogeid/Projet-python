<i>Previously on</i> Terminator:
The Sarah Connor Chronicles...

17
00:00:47,501 --> 00:00:48,843
Come if you want to live.

18
00:00:49,003 --> 00:00:52,973
So, you've been sitting in the same spot
since you bailed out on english.

19
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:55,100
- And your name is?
- It's Riley.

20
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,143
Never brought a girl home before?

21
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:58,979
- No.
- We can move in today.

22
00:00:59,139 --> 00:01:01,356
As soon as I figure out
what to do with all this stuff.

23
00:01:01,516 --> 00:01:04,025
- We'll take it. All of it.
- Cromartie killed 20 FBI guys.

24
00:01:04,185 --> 00:01:05,568
He's here for me.

25
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:07,737
- I'm looking for the Connors.
- Sarah Connor?

26
00:01:07,897 --> 00:01:10,234
Mr. Dixon wanted to marry Sarah Connor
before you.

27
00:01:10,354 --> 00:01:13,535
So take your wife.
Get as far away from here as you can.

28
00:01:13,695 --> 00:01:16,037
Forget me. Forget John. Just go.

29
00:01:16,198 --> 00:01:17,288
It's not safe here.

30
00:01:17,448 --> 00:01:19,749
You know we always thought
we'd raise kids in this house.

31
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:21,501
You just can't plan
for anything now.

32
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,877
For the road.

33
00:03:29,502 --> 00:03:31,604
Did you get me that soda, babe?

34
00:04:14,607 --> 00:04:17,938
I've only been wanting a TV in here
for like a hundred years.

35
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:19,259
Or maybe 200.

36
00:04:20,191 --> 00:04:21,307
That long?

37
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:22,886
Well, a while.

38
00:04:23,614 --> 00:04:25,894
Ex-baby daddy
wouldn't have one in the bedroom.

39
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,135
Look at where that got me.

40
00:04:28,255 --> 00:04:30,315
Well, that, six beers,
and the rhythm method.

41
00:04:32,085 --> 00:04:34,081
- Too much information?
- Yeah, a bit.

42
00:04:34,201 --> 00:04:37,447
Do I need to call the cable guy?
I feel like I'm not even wired in here.

43
00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:40,909
There you are now.

44
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:45,079
But I wouldn't mention it to anybody.
Especially the cable guy.

45
00:04:45,299 --> 00:04:46,551
Clever boy.

46
00:04:54,957 --> 00:04:56,171
<i>Beast Wizard,</i>

47
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:59,469
<i>the Kingdom of Fuel

48
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:00,925
<i>Now, now Seth.</i>

49
00:05:02,104 --> 00:05:04,152
<i>That's no way to treat your brother.</i>

50
00:05:04,272 --> 00:05:07,447
<i>Beast Wizard 7.

<i>when it was released direct-to-video
two years ago,</i>

52
00:05:10,642 --> 00:05:14,640
<i>has earned $6 million

53
00:05:14,977 --> 00:05:16,861
<i>When it's star, George Lazlo,</i>

54
00:05:17,021 --> 00:05:19,409
<i>inexplicably killed 20 members</i>

55
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:21,806
<i>of an FBI hostage rescue team</i>

56
00:05:21,926 --> 00:05:24,869
<i>in a shootout
at his Reseda apartment.</i>

57
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:28,748
<i>The massacre you may recall,
also took the actor's life.</i>

58
00:05:29,237 --> 00:05:32,043
A friend of mine from culinary school,
did craft services on that movie.

59
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:35,466
She liked the guy.
He ate with the crew.

60
00:05:37,355 --> 00:05:39,267
This town can screw you up.

61
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:49,769
What are you doing?

62
00:05:50,258 --> 00:05:52,897
This is the absolute center
of the house.

63
00:05:53,261 --> 00:05:54,565
Excellent. Good work.

64
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:56,590
The house is moving.

65
00:05:57,184 --> 00:05:58,591
- What?
- Moving.

66
00:05:59,004 --> 00:06:01,572
The east by southeast section
of the house is moving.

67
00:06:02,037 --> 00:06:04,492
- Really? Where's it going?
- Down.

68
00:06:04,735 --> 00:06:07,161
At a rate of 0.93 millimeters
per year.

69
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:11,207
And what?
Does that affect the security system,

70
00:06:11,367 --> 00:06:13,380
or sightlines for the night scope?

71
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,379
How does this affect the safety
of one John Connor?

72
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:21,175
It doesn't. But next summer
we're going to have to repaint.

73
00:06:28,602 --> 00:06:30,268
Did you get Kacy's TV set up?

74
00:06:31,762 --> 00:06:33,563
I hope you didn't steal cable
for her.

75
00:06:33,723 --> 00:06:36,222
Nobody that pregnant should be forced
to watch network television.

76
00:06:36,342 --> 00:06:39,399
- It's bad for the baby.
- You don't know anything about babies.

77
00:06:39,562 --> 00:06:40,737
I know they grow up.

78
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:54,083
18 november.

79
00:06:54,338 --> 00:06:56,127
<i>Johnny?
That's the code, right?</i>

80
00:06:59,332 --> 00:07:01,284
- Where are you?
- We...

81
00:07:01,404 --> 00:07:02,914
were on our way out of town.

82
00:07:03,034 --> 00:07:04,507
We're leaving.

83
00:07:05,619 --> 00:07:07,277
- Why?
- Just...

84
00:07:08,597 --> 00:07:11,497
can... can you hang on a second,
please, John?

85
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,089
Okay, I'm...

86
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,595
I'm back. Just...

87
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,373
Just listen, okay...

88
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,207
<i>I just need
to say goodbye to your mom.</i>

89
00:07:37,076 --> 00:07:39,212
<i>I didn't get a chance
to say good-bye and...</i>

90
00:07:39,372 --> 00:07:41,003
<i>She wouldn't give me</i>
<i>her phone number.</i>

91
00:07:41,123 --> 00:07:43,524
I was just hoping maybe you could...

92
00:07:43,768 --> 00:07:45,885
You know, maybe you could just
have her give me a call?

93
00:07:46,696 --> 00:07:47,597
Hang on.

94
00:07:51,726 --> 00:07:52,915
It's for you.

95
00:07:54,794 --> 00:07:55,601
Hello?

96
00:07:58,231 --> 00:07:59,273
He took my wife.

97
00:08:00,912 --> 00:08:02,985
What do you want me to say, Charley?

98
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:06,447
<i>Just hel... Help me Sarah, please.</i>
<i>We were just leaving town.</i>

99
00:08:06,607 --> 00:08:08,706
And he just... He just took her!

100
00:08:09,709 --> 00:08:13,538
I mean, with John standing right here,
what am I supposed to say?

101
00:08:13,915 --> 00:08:15,039
<i>Look, I'm sorry.</i>

102
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,552
I didn't know who else to call.

103
00:08:18,969 --> 00:08:19,908
Please.

104
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:22,038
Please just help me, Sarah.

105
00:08:24,763 --> 00:08:27,885
You shouldn't have called here, Charley.
You were right to leave.

106
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:34,350
I don't want to know where you are,
in case I need you.

107
00:08:35,358 --> 00:08:37,260
<i>I'm not going to need you.</i>

108
00:08:38,355 --> 00:08:40,940
It's better for you if I can't find you.
You understand?

109
00:08:41,263 --> 00:08:43,465
Wait, hold on a sec... Are you...

110
00:08:44,632 --> 00:08:46,612
Are you asking me where I am?

111
00:08:50,526 --> 00:08:51,527
Yes, I am.

112
00:08:54,114 --> 00:08:56,263
I'm just at some fruit stand.

113
00:08:57,533 --> 00:08:58,446
It's...

114
00:08:59,275 --> 00:09:01,669
It's just somewhere off the 14.
Just...

115
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:04,984
South of the California city turnoff.
I think.

116
00:09:05,409 --> 00:09:08,050
Please.
I really need your help, Sarah.

117
00:09:08,265 --> 00:09:09,773
Stay safe, Charley.

118
00:09:13,157 --> 00:09:15,653
I told you not
to give him your number.

119
00:09:18,356 --> 00:09:19,937
There's something alive up there.

120
00:09:20,097 --> 00:09:22,899
- Is it something that can hurt us?
- It's a bird.

121
00:09:23,546 --> 00:09:25,234
I'll kill it before it flies away.

122
00:09:28,354 --> 00:09:30,356
- Maybe later?
- Maybe never.

123
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:33,488
John's gonna buy computers today.

124
00:09:33,608 --> 00:09:36,120
Go with him.
Do not let him out of your sight.

125
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,082
- Is there anything I need to know?
- Not let him out of your sight.

126
00:09:41,869 --> 00:09:43,671
And don't touch that bird.

127
00:09:50,292 --> 00:09:52,694
Cromartie's got Charley Dixon's wife.

128
00:09:53,547 --> 00:09:54,752
Where's John?

129
00:09:55,716 --> 00:09:58,434
I sent him to get the new computers.
He's with Cameron. They don't know.

130
00:10:00,697 --> 00:10:02,386
Well, where are you going?

131
00:10:02,506 --> 00:10:04,522
You know where I'm going.
Come if you want.

132
00:10:04,933 --> 00:10:07,618
- You can't go.
- And yet I am.

133
00:10:09,571 --> 00:10:11,446
It's a ploy to get John.
It's a trap.

134
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:12,782
I know that.

135
00:10:13,293 --> 00:10:14,915
You don't see John here, do you?

136
00:10:15,035 --> 00:10:16,786
It's the absolute wrong thing to do.

137
00:10:17,133 --> 00:10:18,579
It wouldn't be the first time.

138
00:10:19,806 --> 00:10:21,824
Just wait. All right.
Just wait.

139
00:10:21,944 --> 00:10:22,944
Hurry up.

140
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,295
Cameron, Cameron.
Let me help you with that.

141
00:12:39,056 --> 00:12:40,304
I didn't need any help.

142
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:41,700
Yeah, you did.

143
00:12:45,885 --> 00:12:46,698
Right.

144
00:12:52,683 --> 00:12:55,057
- Hi.
- I'm bored. Do you wanna hang out?

145
00:12:55,177 --> 00:12:56,737
I forgot.
18 november.

146
00:12:57,592 --> 00:12:59,626
- Where are you?
- <i>Promenade.</i>

147
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:01,742
<i>The magazine stand
in front of the coffee bar.</i>

148
00:13:02,413 --> 00:13:04,210
I'm captivated by the Lohan.

149
00:13:07,497 --> 00:13:09,541
I could be there in like,
15 minutes, you know.

150
00:13:09,703 --> 00:13:11,627
The world could end in 15 minutes.

151
00:13:12,728 --> 00:13:15,339
- I'm gonna vote I doubt it.
- <i>You never know.</i>

152
00:13:15,499 --> 00:13:17,997
- Lotta Lohan.
- Just stay there. Okay?

153
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,388
Hey.
Can you drop me off?

154
00:13:23,742 --> 00:13:25,148
Was that Riley?

155
00:13:25,895 --> 00:13:27,754
That's none of your business.

156
00:13:28,512 --> 00:13:30,749
Your mother told me
to keep an eye on you.

157
00:13:30,869 --> 00:13:33,232
Yeah, well, that doesn't mean
you have to go everywhere I do.

158
00:13:33,668 --> 00:13:34,871
Yes, it does.

159
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:38,563
Just because my mother said it,
doesn't make it so.

160
00:13:38,683 --> 00:13:41,302
I'm not a child anymore.
I could go to the store, see a friend,

161
00:13:41,422 --> 00:13:43,701
or do whatever the hell
else people like me do.

162
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,703
There are no other people like you.

163
00:13:47,169 --> 00:13:48,450
Just drop me off.

164
00:14:15,495 --> 00:14:18,308
<i>I had heard the trees in this forest
grew lovely fruit.</i>

165
00:14:18,646 --> 00:14:20,354
<i>Yet truly, I had no idea.</i>

166
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,036
<i>I must warn you, my lady.</i>

167
00:14:27,607 --> 00:14:30,013
<i>My striped friend
is an excellent climber.</i>

168
00:14:35,557 --> 00:14:37,814
- Hello.
- <i>Agent James Ellison, please.</i>

169
00:14:37,996 --> 00:14:38,815
Speaking.

170
00:14:38,935 --> 00:14:41,351
<i>My name is Catherine Weaver,
Mr. Ellison.</i>

171
00:14:42,212 --> 00:14:44,853
I'd like to talk to you
about an opportunity.

172
00:14:45,887 --> 00:14:47,563
I'm not interested
in any opportunities.

173
00:14:47,683 --> 00:14:49,680
<i>A job opportunity, Agent Ellison.</i>

174
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:52,532
I presume you won't be returning
to the FBI,

175
00:14:52,652 --> 00:14:54,355
once your leave of absence is over.

176
00:14:55,767 --> 00:14:59,041
- How'd you get my number?
- I'll tell you about it at lunch.

177
00:14:59,161 --> 00:15:01,411
Shall we say...
1:00?

178
00:15:01,774 --> 00:15:04,132
My assistant
will give you the information.

179
00:15:04,252 --> 00:15:04,952
No.

180
00:15:05,694 --> 00:15:07,049
I don't know who you are.

181
00:15:07,483 --> 00:15:09,119
And... I'm very busy.

182
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,497
You're not busy.

183
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:12,132
Come to lunch.

184
00:15:12,574 --> 00:15:16,350
<i>We'll talk about who or what,
actually killed your colleagues.</i>

185
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:42,403
Come on. Come on.

186
00:15:48,385 --> 00:15:50,744
- Where would he take her?
- I don't know.

187
00:15:50,904 --> 00:15:53,162
- Then how are we going to find her?
- I don't know.

188
00:15:53,324 --> 00:15:55,207
- You don't know?
- No.

189
00:15:57,619 --> 00:15:59,564
It could be watching us right now.
We need to go.

190
00:15:59,684 --> 00:16:01,999
What we need to do is find my wife.

191
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,049
She won't tell you the truth,
but I will.

192
00:16:04,477 --> 00:16:05,973
It took your wife to get to John.

193
00:16:06,093 --> 00:16:07,671
You think it gives a damn about her?

194
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,104
Your wife's dead.

195
00:16:13,729 --> 00:16:15,769
- It's her, hmm?
- Make sure it's really her.

196
00:16:16,872 --> 00:16:19,106
They can imitate our voices.
You need to be sure.

197
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:22,359
Baby.

198
00:16:23,994 --> 00:16:25,488
Charley...
Charley...

199
00:16:26,995 --> 00:16:29,059
- <i>Honey, are you okay? Are you hurt?</i>
- No.

200
00:16:29,444 --> 00:16:31,093
Is he there with you?

201
00:16:31,213 --> 00:16:33,245
<i>Yeah, he's in the next room.</i>

202
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,917
I can hear him.

203
00:16:35,324 --> 00:16:38,667
- Where are you?
- <i>Outside Mojave.</i>

204
00:16:39,054 --> 00:16:40,936
In an abandoned building.

205
00:16:41,056 --> 00:16:43,822
About... four...
five miles off the highway.

206
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,424
- The 14?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

207
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,719
There's a...
a billboard for a,

208
00:16:49,306 --> 00:16:51,314
<i>I don't know, a law firm.</i>

209
00:16:51,434 --> 00:16:53,223
<i>A dirt road runs in front of it.</i>

210
00:16:53,592 --> 00:16:56,183
- <i>It goes East...</i>
- Make sure it's her.

211
00:16:56,346 --> 00:16:58,169
It's her.
You think I don't know my own wife?

212
00:17:01,017 --> 00:17:02,028
Charley.

213
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:04,318
Make sure.

214
00:17:08,154 --> 00:17:10,658
All right, babe, I need you
to pay attention right now. Okay?

215
00:17:10,936 --> 00:17:13,319
The first night you and I
ever made love, where was it?

216
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,996
- <i>What?</i>
- Just answer the question, please.

217
00:17:16,622 --> 00:17:19,674
The first time we made love,
where was it?

218
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,666
The beach...

219
00:17:23,556 --> 00:17:24,686
<i>Which beach?</i>

220
00:17:24,806 --> 00:17:27,162
Charley, I don't know...
What?

221
00:17:28,887 --> 00:17:31,235
Malibu.
Paradise Cove.

222
00:17:31,355 --> 00:17:34,063
Okay, and what happened
at dinner that night?

223
00:17:34,341 --> 00:17:36,561
What do you mean, Charley?
What do you mean?

224
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:37,599
I don't know.

225
00:17:37,719 --> 00:17:39,978
Just please, Michelle. Answer.
What happened at dinner?

226
00:17:40,139 --> 00:17:42,815
Oh, God...
The magician took my watch?

227
00:17:44,431 --> 00:17:46,317
I love you, baby. All right? Just...

228
00:17:46,478 --> 00:17:49,998
<i>We're gonna come get you,
just please... Just please hang tight.</i>

229
00:17:51,621 --> 00:17:52,495
<i>Michelle?</i>

230
00:17:52,693 --> 00:17:53,652
Michelle?

231
00:18:29,557 --> 00:18:30,432
Please.

232
00:18:31,588 --> 00:18:32,990
Why are you doing this?

233
00:18:34,665 --> 00:18:36,686
Why are you... No, no.
Please don't tape my mouth.

234
00:18:36,806 --> 00:18:39,494
I won't scream.
I swear I won't scream. I won't scream.

235
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:50,560
In 1897, James Atkinson
invented the mousetrap.

236
00:18:52,978 --> 00:18:55,804
Its spring slams shut
in 38 thousands of a second.

237
00:19:03,013 --> 00:19:04,855
It is a record
that has never been beaten.

238
00:19:12,154 --> 00:19:13,655
It is hard to build a better one.

239
00:19:29,685 --> 00:19:31,965
You know what really creeps me out
about these magazines?

240
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,968
They all just want
to convert you into their cult.

241
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,305
It's like...
All in the titles.

242
00:19:38,465 --> 00:19:40,974
It's us.
And people, and okay.

243
00:19:41,915 --> 00:19:44,946
You know some of us people
aren't okay.

244
00:19:45,494 --> 00:19:48,857
Some of us are...
popular mechanics.

245
00:19:49,324 --> 00:19:50,183
Exactly.

246
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,903
Some of use are...
guns and ammo.

247
00:19:53,063 --> 00:19:55,322
Yeah, you're more a yarn collector.

248
00:19:56,402 --> 00:19:58,909
You're the yarn collector.
Yarn collector.

249
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,206
So... You coming back to school?

250
00:20:05,673 --> 00:20:07,246
No, I don't think so.

251
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,307
My mom wants to...

252
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:11,463
Home school me for a while.

253
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,675
Sounds like a good time
will be had by all.

254
00:20:15,933 --> 00:20:16,949
What?

255
00:20:17,659 --> 00:20:18,717
You miss me?

256
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,223
Ease up, cat fancy.

257
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,601
I don't even know
your top ten brands of scratching post.

258
00:20:24,761 --> 00:20:26,188
Cat fancy...

259
00:20:27,848 --> 00:20:29,501
Dude.
Your sister.

260
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,897
We should go. Now.

261
00:21:13,254 --> 00:21:15,620
Wait.
How do we get inside here?

262
00:21:15,815 --> 00:21:18,015
Getting inside's not the problem.

263
00:21:21,412 --> 00:21:23,264
Try to hit something metal.

264
00:22:25,907 --> 00:22:26,945
Wait.

265
00:22:45,312 --> 00:22:46,579
Don't touch her.

266
00:22:59,384 --> 00:23:01,508
They never let you
have a good day, do they?

267
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:07,321
I'm gonna take the tape off.
Don't move.

268
00:23:07,933 --> 00:23:09,075
Do not move.

269
00:23:09,674 --> 00:23:11,435
You understand?
Not one inch.

270
00:23:13,346 --> 00:23:15,270
Oh, God. Oh, God.

271
00:23:17,097 --> 00:23:18,775
You shut up.
Listen to me.

272
00:23:19,506 --> 00:23:22,654
You're sitting on a bomb.
If you move. It will go off.

273
00:23:23,073 --> 00:23:24,073
Baby. Hey.

274
00:23:25,025 --> 00:23:27,073
We're gonna get you outta this chair.

275
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,284
And then we're all
gonna get outta here.

276
00:23:29,404 --> 00:23:30,991
But, just please...

277
00:23:31,367 --> 00:23:33,196
You have to listen to her.

278
00:23:33,372 --> 00:23:34,402
Please.

279
00:23:34,948 --> 00:23:36,226
Where is he?

280
00:23:37,312 --> 00:23:39,504
If I'm not back in 15 minutes,
leave without me.

281
00:23:41,646 --> 00:23:42,982
Just get me out.

282
00:23:43,177 --> 00:23:45,126
Get me out of here.
Get me out.

283
00:23:51,199 --> 00:23:53,174
I'm trying, Charley.
I'm trying.

284
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:55,812
But the more I sit here,
the more I wanna stand up.

285
00:23:55,972 --> 00:23:57,314
My legs are on fire.

286
00:23:57,644 --> 00:24:00,984
- It's the adrenaline.
- I know it's the adrenaline.

287
00:24:03,939 --> 00:24:05,280
I just have to get up.

288
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,324
They're on fire.
They're full of ants.

289
00:24:07,827 --> 00:24:10,072
If you move.
You will die.

290
00:24:10,267 --> 00:24:11,453
We all will.

291
00:24:17,607 --> 00:24:18,958
Baby. Look at me.

292
00:24:19,621 --> 00:24:21,525
It's all gonna be all right.
I promise.

293
00:24:22,898 --> 00:24:24,693
It's never gonna be okay.

294
00:24:24,944 --> 00:24:26,007
Never.

295
00:24:36,491 --> 00:24:38,370
There's a bag in the truck.

296
00:24:39,247 --> 00:24:41,399
Red handles.
I'm gonna need it, Charley.

297
00:24:57,023 --> 00:24:58,721
What are you doing here?

298
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,608
I know he brought you.
But you didn't have to come.

299
00:25:01,728 --> 00:25:02,629
Yes, I did.

300
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:04,130
For Charley?

301
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,314
I just did.

302
00:25:10,444 --> 00:25:12,514
Frankly, I thought it'd be easier.

303
00:25:14,104 --> 00:25:15,851
I thought you'd be dead.

304
00:25:46,714 --> 00:25:48,079
He killed the car.

305
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:50,864
We're gonna have to walk outta here.

306
00:25:59,695 --> 00:26:00,395
What?

307
00:26:02,924 --> 00:26:05,692
It doesn't make any sense.
He messes with the car and not us.

308
00:26:07,226 --> 00:26:09,481
We're human.
Not that hard to kill.

309
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:15,492
Molding clay.

310
00:26:16,112 --> 00:26:17,162
Son of a bitch.

311
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:20,170
Cut her free.

312
00:26:21,697 --> 00:26:23,023
Was it fake?

313
00:26:23,357 --> 00:26:25,003
This whole thing was a fake?

314
00:26:25,238 --> 00:26:26,199
He wants John.

315
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:29,457
Doesn't have to kill us to get to him.
If we're stuck here with no way back.

316
00:26:29,577 --> 00:26:31,259
Should have known
when you weren't dead.

317
00:26:37,182 --> 00:26:38,783
John, 18 november.
Where are you?

318
00:26:38,903 --> 00:26:40,560
<i>2007. Promenade.</i>

319
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,195
<i>Is Cameron with you?</i>

320
00:26:42,668 --> 00:26:43,625
Yeah. Why?

321
00:26:43,745 --> 00:26:46,483
I need you to stay out.
Don't go home. Don't go to Kacy's.

322
00:26:47,059 --> 00:26:48,201
<i>Don't go.</i>

323
00:26:49,843 --> 00:26:51,824
<i>All right, Mom.
What's going on?</i>

324
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:55,325
- <i>Stay out until you hear for me.</i>
- <i>Why? What's happening?</i>

325
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:02,873
<i>Don't go anyplace familiar.
Find a place to hide until I call you.</i>

326
00:27:04,577 --> 00:27:05,919
Just promise me, John.

327
00:27:06,978 --> 00:27:08,537
So, what do you think?

328
00:27:10,263 --> 00:27:11,549
All right. I promise.

329
00:27:11,709 --> 00:27:13,802
Okay, you can do better than that.
Cat fancy.

330
00:27:14,249 --> 00:27:17,138
Stay with Cameron.
Don't call me. I'll call you.

331
00:27:17,298 --> 00:27:18,181
Okay, fine.

332
00:27:19,957 --> 00:27:20,892
Well?

333
00:27:21,949 --> 00:27:23,394
That's awesome.

334
00:27:24,801 --> 00:27:26,314
That was your weird sister, right?

335
00:27:26,474 --> 00:27:28,393
No, it was my weird mother.

336
00:28:11,936 --> 00:28:14,261
Run! There's a bomb.
Get out! Go! Go!

337
00:28:23,979 --> 00:28:25,915
Everyone good?
Everyone good?

338
00:28:27,536 --> 00:28:29,586
I'm good.
Everyone good?

339
00:28:30,249 --> 00:28:32,255
- I'm fine. I'm fine.
- I'm okay.

340
00:28:39,116 --> 00:28:41,703
The cell tower out back.
He blew it.

341
00:28:41,891 --> 00:28:43,767
After he tapped
your call to John.

342
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,935
He has John's number.
And the code.

343
00:28:46,095 --> 00:28:47,370
That won't work now.

344
00:28:50,502 --> 00:28:51,816
Baby, baby. You okay?

345
00:28:51,976 --> 00:28:53,203
Charley, move.

346
00:29:14,913 --> 00:29:17,133
- <i>18 november.</i>
- 2007.

347
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:20,390
Change of plans, John.
How far are you from the pier?

348
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,138
A few blocks, I don't know.

349
00:29:22,298 --> 00:29:24,307
Wait for me there.
And turn off your phone.

350
00:29:25,193 --> 00:29:27,003
What is going on?
Where are you?

351
00:29:27,226 --> 00:29:28,645
<i>Don't worry about me, John.</i>

352
00:29:28,805 --> 00:29:30,358
Just get to the pier.

353
00:29:45,642 --> 00:29:47,510
- I'm sorry. I have to go.
- What?

354
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:50,583
- I thought we were going to the movies.
- I have to meet my mom at the pier.

355
00:29:50,743 --> 00:29:51,584
Seriously?

356
00:29:52,893 --> 00:29:55,321
Look John,
I'm not afraid of your mother.

357
00:29:55,441 --> 00:29:56,506
Not like you are.

358
00:29:59,544 --> 00:30:01,344
I have to go.
I'll call you.

359
00:30:04,615 --> 00:30:06,661
Don't forget the secret code!

360
00:30:07,719 --> 00:30:08,838
Come on.

361
00:30:08,958 --> 00:30:12,013
I figure it's five miles to the highway
if we head due west.

362
00:30:12,133 --> 00:30:13,483
Across the desert.

363
00:30:14,456 --> 00:30:15,567
We need a car.

364
00:30:16,463 --> 00:30:18,147
We need to get to John.

365
00:30:20,013 --> 00:30:21,238
Oh, God.

366
00:30:25,643 --> 00:30:26,820
How bad is it?

367
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,276
I can't tell.

368
00:30:28,396 --> 00:30:30,915
I can't tell if the shrapnel
knicked an artery or something...

369
00:30:31,075 --> 00:30:33,340
She could be bleeding out,
inside, I don't know.

370
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,712
- We have to go.
- Go? Go how?

371
00:30:35,872 --> 00:30:36,928
On foot.

372
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,557
No way, Sarah.

373
00:30:39,072 --> 00:30:41,342
I'm not moving her.
And I'm not making her walk.

374
00:30:44,989 --> 00:30:47,606
I'll send someone back
for you as soon as I can.

375
00:30:51,086 --> 00:30:52,186
I can walk.

376
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:57,155
No one has to wait on me.

377
00:31:29,007 --> 00:31:30,009
So...

378
00:31:32,863 --> 00:31:34,311
You know who I am.

379
00:31:35,647 --> 00:31:37,360
You know what happened.

380
00:31:39,782 --> 00:31:41,634
George Lazlo was a shooter.

381
00:31:41,968 --> 00:31:43,593
George Lazlo is dead.

382
00:31:44,805 --> 00:31:46,324
It's all in the report.

383
00:31:47,273 --> 00:31:48,897
And yet here you are.

384
00:31:51,765 --> 00:31:53,047
Five years ago,

385
00:31:53,367 --> 00:31:56,463
a small commuter jet went down
in the Eastern Sierras.

386
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:58,628
On its way
from Sacramento to Portland.

387
00:31:59,422 --> 00:32:02,799
My brother was on the NTSB team
that investigated the accident.

388
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,093
He found these.

389
00:32:05,585 --> 00:32:07,317
And brought them to me.

390
00:32:15,698 --> 00:32:19,274
My late husband and I
have spent three years and $20 million,

391
00:32:19,736 --> 00:32:22,423
trying to reverse engineer
this technology.

392
00:32:23,714 --> 00:32:25,446
We've not been successful.

393
00:32:25,606 --> 00:32:26,447
Yet.

394
00:32:33,228 --> 00:32:34,927
Red valley, new Mexico.

395
00:32:35,845 --> 00:32:37,154
Eight years ago.

396
00:32:37,962 --> 00:32:40,253
22 witnesses report seeing a man

397
00:32:40,605 --> 00:32:42,861
with some kind of robot leg,

398
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:47,260
try to kill a boy
later identified as John Connor.

399
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,217
Son of Sarah Connor.

400
00:32:53,027 --> 00:32:54,459
It was your case.

401
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:56,645
She believed

402
00:32:57,276 --> 00:32:59,276
robots were after her son.

403
00:33:00,543 --> 00:33:02,692
I know what she believed,
Ms. Weaver.

404
00:33:02,962 --> 00:33:05,819
You know
what really killed those agents.

405
00:33:07,545 --> 00:33:09,198
You did not even pretend to ask me

406
00:33:10,761 --> 00:33:12,160
what those were.

407
00:33:15,462 --> 00:33:17,304
What do you want from me?

408
00:33:17,778 --> 00:33:19,977
I want what you want, Mr. Ellison.

409
00:33:20,632 --> 00:33:21,954
I want answers.

410
00:33:24,098 --> 00:33:25,574
But more than that,

411
00:33:26,047 --> 00:33:28,553
I want you
to help me find another one.

412
00:34:04,374 --> 00:34:05,463
Where's John?

413
00:34:22,362 --> 00:34:23,365
Get out.

414
00:34:23,894 --> 00:34:24,820
Out!

415
00:35:17,412 --> 00:35:18,870
Sarah, slow down!

416
00:35:21,157 --> 00:35:23,583
She's bleeding out.
I need to get pressure on it, Sarah.

417
00:35:26,853 --> 00:35:29,088
Damn you, Charley.
I told you to stay away.

418
00:35:31,792 --> 00:35:33,926
Sarah, you've gotta stop now,
please!

419
00:35:34,398 --> 00:35:37,096
- You should have stayed away.
- I'm here now and she's here now.

420
00:35:37,256 --> 00:35:38,765
You've got to stop. Now!

421
00:39:26,402 --> 00:39:27,478
Little help?

422
00:39:28,447 --> 00:39:31,038
- I don't swim.
- Yeah, I just figured that out.

423
00:39:55,075 --> 00:39:56,605
Mom, I'm good.
Let's go.

424
00:41:36,448 --> 00:41:38,228
We do not lose heart.

425
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,471
Though outwardly
we are wasting away,

426
00:41:41,672 --> 00:41:43,656
inwardly,
we are being renewed...

427
00:41:43,851 --> 00:41:45,228
Day-by-day.

428
00:41:48,163 --> 00:41:52,464
For our light and momentary troubles
are achieving for us

429
00:41:52,659 --> 00:41:56,573
an eternal glory,
that far outweighs them all.

430
00:41:58,605 --> 00:42:02,600
We know that if the earthly tent
we live in is destroyed,

431
00:42:03,098 --> 00:42:05,440
we have a building from God,

432
00:42:06,134 --> 00:42:08,487
a house not made with hands,

433
00:42:08,879 --> 00:42:10,925
eternal in the Heavens.

434
00:42:12,189 --> 00:42:16,031
For God who's given us the Spirit
as a guarantee,

435
00:42:16,309 --> 00:42:19,449
and as long as we are at home
in the body,

436
00:42:19,673 --> 00:42:21,955
we are away from the Lord.

437
00:42:23,186 --> 00:42:26,630
We walk by faith, not by sight.

438
00:42:27,237 --> 00:42:30,892
And so we fix our eyes
not on what is seen,

439
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,329
but what is unseen.

440
00:42:34,282 --> 00:42:36,961
For what is seen is temporary.

441
00:42:37,818 --> 00:42:39,787
What is unseen...

442
00:42:40,678 --> 00:42:42,036
eternal.
