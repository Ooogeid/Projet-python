2
00:00:02,795 --> 00:00:05,495
- You've got a nuclear sub?
- Seawolf sub.

3
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,716
The Jimmy Carter. We've got a scrubbed
trip eight for a captain.

4
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:11,636
Damn it, Cameron,
you're supposed to burn the endos.

5
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:13,948
- What is happening with you?
- I've planted an explosive

6
00:00:14,073 --> 00:00:16,934
in my skull, near my chin.
It's a small amount, but it's enough.

7
00:00:17,101 --> 00:00:19,310
I saw the metal,
and she knows that I saw it.

8
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:21,187
Master your fear.
Remember the mission.

9
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:22,605
I can't go back there.

10
00:00:23,424 --> 00:00:26,942
You are here to keep John Connor
away from her.

11
00:00:28,573 --> 00:00:30,863
- I can get her to tell me the truth.
- Stay away from her.

12
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:34,219
Cameron was supposed to kill me!
You knew that was the only thing

13
00:00:34,344 --> 00:00:36,035
that would turn John against her.

14
00:00:36,204 --> 00:00:37,995
I rescued you from hell!

15
00:00:38,165 --> 00:00:39,914
And I took you to paradise.

16
00:01:31,938 --> 00:01:34,451
You don't need to be so dramatic.
It's a milk run.

17
00:01:34,576 --> 00:01:37,733
A milk run across 8,000 miles
of metal-infested ocean.

18
00:01:37,858 --> 00:01:39,985
Are you gonna be like this
every time I ship out?

19
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,484
Listen, Jesse,
I'm going on a mission, too.

20
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,354
I see.
One of those missions.

21
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:49,050
It's something else.

22
00:01:50,085 --> 00:01:52,135
- It's different.
- Different.

23
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,864
How's it different?
What does different mean?

24
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,240
Different means different.

25
00:01:58,836 --> 00:02:00,035
Just listen to me.

26
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,499
You're stuck in a can under the ocean,
with one of those things...

27
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:08,419
Don't worry about Queeg.
He's a good bloke.

28
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:09,937
He's not a bloke.

29
00:02:11,329 --> 00:02:13,883
Jesse, he's not on our side.
Don't ever think that.

30
00:02:16,684 --> 00:02:18,034
Aim for the chip.

31
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,580
Aim for the chip, they don't get up.

32
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,280
I love you too.

33
00:02:44,727 --> 00:02:46,577
Means "I'll see you later."

34
00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:08,069
What're you doing?

35
00:03:08,846 --> 00:03:09,994
Moving.

36
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,730
Yeah, well...

37
00:03:13,673 --> 00:03:15,973
Seems about the right time for that.

38
00:03:16,176 --> 00:03:17,776
Get your stuff sorted.

39
00:03:18,994 --> 00:03:22,501
I'm nearly done with the living room,
I'm gonna start on the garage.

40
00:03:24,267 --> 00:03:26,667
Why don't you let me
take the garage?

41
00:03:27,331 --> 00:03:29,375
I got a lot of memory cards
and flash drives.

42
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:32,355
I need to sort through. I don't want us
to save our Dakara Records

43
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,547
and torch my old copy
of Space Invaders.

44
00:03:35,773 --> 00:03:37,023
It's all yours.

45
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,385
Thanks.

46
00:03:54,638 --> 00:03:57,778
Great, it looks like
a robot serial killer lives here.

47
00:03:57,947 --> 00:03:59,297
I guess one does.

48
00:03:59,798 --> 00:04:01,073
I'm doing inventory.

49
00:04:01,703 --> 00:04:04,012
Don't do it here.
We need to clear all this stuff out

50
00:04:04,137 --> 00:04:06,287
before mom comes in and finds it.

51
00:04:08,744 --> 00:04:10,244
Dig a hole out back.

52
00:04:10,578 --> 00:04:12,126
Down below the retaining wall.

53
00:04:12,464 --> 00:04:14,935
We'll bury the parts
and come back for them later.

54
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,216
We have to find a place
to burn them.

55
00:04:18,348 --> 00:04:19,948
And we will burn them.

56
00:04:41,505 --> 00:04:42,905
What you drinking?

57
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,391
I don't know.

58
00:04:45,296 --> 00:04:47,161
You don't know what you're drinking?

59
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,920
There's booze in it.

60
00:04:50,045 --> 00:04:53,751
Some sugary crap to cut the hell
outta the burning taste, and some ice.

61
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,970
'Course,
this one's pretty much empty.

62
00:04:59,593 --> 00:05:01,743
Can you get her another one of...

63
00:05:01,983 --> 00:05:04,386
whatever she's drinking?
How do you order it?

64
00:05:04,617 --> 00:05:06,017
Just like you did.

65
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:10,267
But it's gotta start somewhere.
You can't just sit down and ask for it.

66
00:05:13,616 --> 00:05:15,844
- What happened to your face?
- Lot of questions

67
00:05:15,969 --> 00:05:17,989
for a guy
who wants to get in my pants.

68
00:05:18,114 --> 00:05:20,236
- Do I?
- Yeah, see... there's another one.

69
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,950
That's a nice costume.

70
00:05:24,075 --> 00:05:26,825
You thinking about a career
in the military?

71
00:05:27,753 --> 00:05:29,745
Actually, I fly P-3S.

72
00:05:30,251 --> 00:05:31,402
For the Navy.

73
00:05:32,218 --> 00:05:34,468
- Brown shoe.
- Guilty as charged.

74
00:05:35,216 --> 00:05:36,716
- You?
- Submarine.

75
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:39,137
- Bubblehead.
- A bubblehead!

76
00:05:39,262 --> 00:05:41,089
They let women on subs in Australia?

77
00:05:42,562 --> 00:05:44,426
Reprogrammed killer robots too.

78
00:05:47,758 --> 00:05:49,658
Yeah, we don't discriminate.

79
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,958
Well, there's a coincidence.

80
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:54,853
I hunt subs, you drive subs.

81
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,822
Sort of like the wolf
and the sheep dog.

82
00:05:57,947 --> 00:06:00,316
Not that I'm comparing you
to a dog, or anything.

83
00:06:02,373 --> 00:06:05,269
That's a good point, actually.
In fact, I just remembered something.

84
00:06:05,394 --> 00:06:07,574
- What's that?
- Sheep dogs hate wolves.

85
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,578
And I hate brown shoes.

86
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,921
I can't believe you guys are
just up and moving like this.

87
00:06:22,046 --> 00:06:24,842
You could let me throw a party.
You know you never did come to dinner.

88
00:06:25,964 --> 00:06:27,040
Tape.

89
00:06:27,165 --> 00:06:28,165
It's okay.

90
00:06:28,548 --> 00:06:31,557
It's not like you're moving to Mars.
We can still totally keep in touch.

91
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,341
Absolutely.

92
00:06:34,578 --> 00:06:36,812
- Let me help you with that.
- I'm good. Sit down.

93
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:39,043
You know, I'm fine.

94
00:06:39,168 --> 00:06:41,885
People say it takes a while
to get back to fighting trim,

95
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:43,902
but I snapped back
like a rubber band.

96
00:06:44,266 --> 00:06:46,366
Yeah, mostly like a rubber band.

97
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:47,792
You look great.

98
00:06:47,917 --> 00:06:50,961
I'm thinking if I can
breastfeed him till he's five,

99
00:06:51,086 --> 00:06:53,996
maybe I can trick my body
into letting me keep these boobs.

100
00:06:55,403 --> 00:06:57,134
Kidding.
Sort of.

101
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,528
- Who's got the baby?
- Trevor.

102
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:01,920
He's...

103
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:05,915
He's not back, he's just visiting.

104
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:08,344
He said he needed some daddy-time.

105
00:07:08,859 --> 00:07:10,194
I don't blame him.

106
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,139
Not after the call
they got last night.

107
00:07:15,193 --> 00:07:16,958
They found a girl

108
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:18,604
in the river.

109
00:07:19,107 --> 00:07:20,757
Shot through the chest.

110
00:07:21,247 --> 00:07:23,497
Trevor had said that it looked like

111
00:07:23,863 --> 00:07:25,069
she'd been executed.

112
00:07:25,568 --> 00:07:26,868
That's terrible.

113
00:07:27,107 --> 00:07:28,703
Pretty little blonde thing.

114
00:07:28,828 --> 00:07:32,351
Probably moved here from Iowa
or something to be an actress,

115
00:07:32,476 --> 00:07:34,676
and fell in with the wrong people.

116
00:07:34,801 --> 00:07:36,101
Dreams die hard.

117
00:07:36,696 --> 00:07:39,786
Then Trevor said
all they have to go on are some scars

118
00:07:39,911 --> 00:07:41,502
from an attempted suicide

119
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:43,804
and a tattoo on her wrist.

120
00:07:44,538 --> 00:07:46,131
A pretty little star.

121
00:07:46,922 --> 00:07:47,972
Right here.

122
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:58,944
Your mother's coming.

123
00:07:59,904 --> 00:08:01,687
All right, quick.
Hide this stuff.

124
00:08:15,974 --> 00:08:17,246
I need to talk to John.

125
00:08:20,335 --> 00:08:21,335
Alone.

126
00:08:48,514 --> 00:08:49,714
Goodbye, bird.

127
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:52,697
There's a 51% chance
I wouldn't have killed you.

128
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:19,600
I know.

129
00:09:20,677 --> 00:09:21,727
I heard you.

130
00:09:23,092 --> 00:09:24,242
Riley's dead.

Was it you?

134
00:09:58,192 --> 00:09:59,542
Did you kill her?

135
00:10:02,262 --> 00:10:03,398
What if I did?

136
00:10:06,436 --> 00:10:08,088
Don't play games with me.

137
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:10,766
I need the truth.

138
00:10:11,561 --> 00:10:12,913
I didn't kill her.

139
00:10:15,454 --> 00:10:17,792
- I wanna believe you.
- Believe me.

140
00:10:18,521 --> 00:10:20,097
Sometimes you lie to me.

141
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:23,666
Yes.

142
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:26,783
I do, but I'm not lying now.

143
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,760
I am sorry.

144
00:10:34,574 --> 00:10:35,695
You're sorry?

145
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,553
For what?

146
00:10:39,464 --> 00:10:40,661
For your loss.

147
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:46,222
I really wish
I could believe that too.

148
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,571
So are you gonna say anything?

149
00:11:06,762 --> 00:11:07,762
Thanks.

150
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:09,135
Thanks.

151
00:11:09,783 --> 00:11:11,992
For bailing me out.
Thanks.

152
00:11:13,137 --> 00:11:16,636
- I know you don't like police stations.
- Maybe that's because I'm a fugitive.

153
00:11:16,761 --> 00:11:17,761
I know.

154
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,220
- So thanks.
- What happened?

155
00:11:25,134 --> 00:11:26,935
I told you, I got in a fight.

156
00:11:27,932 --> 00:11:30,705
With four naval aviators.

157
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:34,110
Really just three.
One of them went down pretty quick.

158
00:11:35,325 --> 00:11:36,567
What's going on?

159
00:11:40,198 --> 00:11:41,198
Nothing.

160
00:11:42,383 --> 00:11:43,744
I don't believe you.

161
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:46,288
I need to know
what the hell's going on.

162
00:11:47,244 --> 00:11:48,790
I told you.
Nothing.

163
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,933
- We crossed the line yet?
- Not yet.

164
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,378
Give it a tick.

165
00:12:09,824 --> 00:12:13,273
Zero degrees north, heading
south-southwest over the equator.

166
00:12:13,977 --> 00:12:15,484
Now we've crossed the line.

167
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:25,494
One nice thing about metal driving
the boat, a schedule's a schedule.

168
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:27,897
One nice thing.

169
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:30,456
- That mean we're done?
- Quiet, you.

170
00:12:32,357 --> 00:12:33,448
Proclamation.

171
00:12:39,514 --> 00:12:42,128
Know ye, that sonarman second class
Christopher Garvin,

172
00:12:42,266 --> 00:12:45,263
on the 13th day of September, 2027,

173
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,057
aboard USS Jimmy Carter,

174
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:50,622
appeared at the equator
at latitude zero, longitude 180,

175
00:12:50,747 --> 00:12:52,521
entering into our royal domain,

176
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:55,297
and having been inspected
and found worthy by my royal staff,

177
00:12:55,503 --> 00:12:59,027
was initiated into the solemn mysteries
of the Ancient Order of the Deep.

178
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,237
I command my subjects
to honor and respect him

179
00:13:01,362 --> 00:13:03,309
as one of our trusty shellbacks.

180
00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:06,243
Now rise, shellback.

181
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:15,043
- Never gets old, does it?
- Never.

182
00:13:18,573 --> 00:13:19,770
Depth charge?

183
00:13:23,445 --> 00:13:25,970
General quarters, go.
Go!

184
00:13:38,202 --> 00:13:40,318
Come and play hide and seek, mommy.

185
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,904
- I'm working.
- But you promised.

186
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,716
Patience is a virtue, Savannah.
To tolerate delay.

187
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,954
It implies self-control
and forbearance.

188
00:13:51,324 --> 00:13:53,457
As opposed to wanting
what we want when we want it.

189
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:55,667
Something to think about.

190
00:15:22,783 --> 00:15:24,996
Would you like
to play hide and seek?

191
00:15:41,655 --> 00:15:42,855
My daughter, Savannah...

192
00:15:44,156 --> 00:15:45,398
She's missing.

193
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:49,489
She's in the building, Mr. Ellison.
We just have to find her.

194
00:15:50,656 --> 00:15:52,617
- There's 23 stories.
- Yes.

195
00:15:53,013 --> 00:15:55,861
And there's someone who knows
what's going on in all of them.

196
00:16:02,111 --> 00:16:04,975
John Henry, we're looking
for my daughter, Savannah.

197
00:16:05,336 --> 00:16:07,799
- Have you seen her today?
- Yes, I have.

198
00:16:08,557 --> 00:16:09,959
She wanted to play a game.

199
00:16:10,084 --> 00:16:12,531
- Where is she now?
- She's hiding.

200
00:16:13,337 --> 00:16:14,754
Tell us where she's hiding.

201
00:16:15,216 --> 00:16:16,933
That's not how the game works.

202
00:16:17,877 --> 00:16:19,185
How's the game work?

203
00:16:19,555 --> 00:16:21,934
Hide and seek,
there are many variations.

204
00:16:23,114 --> 00:16:24,899
The one we're playing,

205
00:16:25,024 --> 00:16:27,750
you guess what I'm thinking,
I give you a clue.

206
00:16:28,216 --> 00:16:29,830
Listen to me, John Henry.

207
00:16:30,196 --> 00:16:32,699
You're gonna tell me where Savannah is,
and you're gonna tell me now.

208
00:16:33,231 --> 00:16:35,049
I'm thinking of a country.

209
00:16:36,653 --> 00:16:37,713
Come again?

210
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:41,069
Let's play the game.

211
00:16:42,655 --> 00:16:45,420
This is ridiculous!
I'm not gonna bargain with a computer.

212
00:16:45,843 --> 00:16:47,836
If I'm not mistaken, Mr. Ellison,

213
00:16:48,437 --> 00:16:49,716
we've got no choice.

214
00:16:55,053 --> 00:16:56,992
You hit him in the mouth,
didn't you?

215
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,056
Never aim for the mouth.

216
00:17:01,168 --> 00:17:03,054
- What's that?
- Antibiotic.

217
00:17:05,948 --> 00:17:08,033
You know, one time
when Kyle and I were kids,

218
00:17:08,158 --> 00:17:11,528
we saw two tunnel trolls go at it

219
00:17:11,653 --> 00:17:13,706
over a can of stewed tomatoes.

220
00:17:14,371 --> 00:17:17,386
The loser got three teeth knocked out,
and the winner...

221
00:17:18,403 --> 00:17:20,801
got a blood infection
from his split knuckles

222
00:17:20,926 --> 00:17:22,510
and died a week later.

223
00:17:23,454 --> 00:17:25,126
The human mouth is filthy.

224
00:17:26,778 --> 00:17:28,006
You got that?

225
00:17:38,655 --> 00:17:39,655
What?

226
00:17:44,591 --> 00:17:45,480
Damn.

227
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,405
John okay?

228
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:54,029
All right.

229
00:17:55,211 --> 00:17:56,984
Hold tight, I'm on my way.

230
00:18:02,905 --> 00:18:06,626
John's... girlfriend is dead.

231
00:18:08,843 --> 00:18:10,101
A cyborg did it.

232
00:18:12,653 --> 00:18:14,634
- You know that for sure?
- Who else could it be?

233
00:18:15,777 --> 00:18:17,937
- What are you gonna do?
- About the metal?

234
00:18:18,062 --> 00:18:19,222
What are you gonna do?

235
00:18:20,306 --> 00:18:21,850
Because you can't kill her, Derek.

236
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:25,192
- What?
- That's not something you can do.

237
00:18:26,059 --> 00:18:28,398
He has to make that decision
on his own.

238
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,571
You've really thought this through.

239
00:18:39,747 --> 00:18:40,747
No.

240
00:18:42,967 --> 00:18:44,409
But I think about it.

241
00:18:45,763 --> 00:18:47,000
Just like you do.

242
00:18:54,054 --> 00:18:55,133
More depth charges.

243
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:57,802
Shook us up a bit, but no damage.

244
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:01,028
They want us to make a mistake.
Reveal our position.

245
00:19:01,153 --> 00:19:03,513
A lot of metal
in the water, Captain.

246
00:19:03,638 --> 00:19:04,714
Barrage.

247
00:19:05,402 --> 00:19:06,936
- Getting closer.
- ASW bots.

248
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:08,979
- How many?
- Travel in packs, no way to tell.

249
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:10,317
Mister Gavin?

250
00:19:14,889 --> 00:19:16,117
Not ASW bots.

251
00:19:22,121 --> 00:19:24,245
Oh, man. Oh, man.
Kraken.

252
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:26,039
We got a kraken.

253
00:19:26,376 --> 00:19:28,291
- You sure?
- Bet my life on it.

254
00:19:29,507 --> 00:19:32,276
- Feed the sonar picture to tactical.
- Aye, ma'am.

255
00:19:37,337 --> 00:19:40,804
You're a big fellow, aren't you?
And you're very far from home.

256
00:19:44,776 --> 00:19:45,975
That can't be right.

257
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:48,904
- Where are we?
- Chief of the boat,

258
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:50,897
status of our torpedo stock?

259
00:19:51,587 --> 00:19:54,108
Two, maybe three
I'd consider worth using in a fight.

260
00:19:54,278 --> 00:19:56,486
Ready tube one.
Hold for my order.

261
00:20:01,128 --> 00:20:02,101
Queeg.

262
00:20:02,226 --> 00:20:05,015
You can't fight a kraken
with one torpedo. Or three.

263
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,872
We need to break contact
and find a way around.

264
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,341
Mister Garvin, active sonar, please.

265
00:20:10,832 --> 00:20:12,092
One ping only.

266
00:20:15,767 --> 00:20:16,967
One ping, aye.

267
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:27,016
Torpedo in the water.
Closing fast. Maybe... 40 seconds.

268
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,643
Status on my torpedo?

269
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:30,770
- Torpedo ready, but...
- Thirty second fuse.

270
00:20:30,956 --> 00:20:33,398
Match our speed
and bearing after breakaway.

271
00:20:33,828 --> 00:20:34,690
Fire.

272
00:20:36,578 --> 00:20:38,361
You heard him. Fire.

273
00:20:46,892 --> 00:20:49,843
- Torpedo away.
- Still closing, 55 knots.

274
00:20:56,203 --> 00:20:58,298
You got us 20 degrees down bubble.

275
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:00,049
Ahead, full.
Queeg, you're tak...

276
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,844
Taking the boat to 729.8 meters.

277
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,221
- Crush depth.
- To the edge of crush depth.

278
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,269
The kraken won't be able to follow.

279
00:21:07,394 --> 00:21:10,087
The sonar will reflect off
the thermocline layer.

280
00:21:10,212 --> 00:21:13,104
- We'll be...
- Invisible. We're playing dead.

281
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,732
- Eight seconds to torpedo contact.
- Approaching crush depth.

282
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,194
If he's off by even a millimeter,
for even a fraction of a second...

283
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:21,643
He won't be.
This is what he does.

284
00:21:23,828 --> 00:21:25,783
Two detonations.
Our torpedo and theirs.

285
00:21:26,643 --> 00:21:29,329
1,100 meters to starboard.
120 on the Z.

286
00:21:29,878 --> 00:21:31,188
And now we roll over,

287
00:21:31,313 --> 00:21:33,458
stick out our tongue,
and hold our breath.

288
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:42,258
Skipper, we're at 729.8.

289
00:21:42,678 --> 00:21:44,510
I'm aware, Chief.
Thank you.

290
00:21:47,571 --> 00:21:50,058
729.8... and holding.

291
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,399
You may return
to your duty stations now.

292
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:04,030
You heard the Captain, people.

293
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,981
What, you've never been
20 centimeters from your maker?

294
00:22:07,106 --> 00:22:08,081
Move.

295
00:22:12,639 --> 00:22:15,703
Skipper, when we're done
skating over our deaths...

296
00:22:15,828 --> 00:22:17,178
I got a question.

297
00:22:19,577 --> 00:22:21,677
Why are we 300 miles off course?

298
00:22:40,423 --> 00:22:42,423
We were using it for research.

299
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:45,238
- To find out what...
- Don't.

300
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:46,756
John, just don't.

301
00:22:48,198 --> 00:22:50,535
Don't make excuses for her.
Don't cover for her.

302
00:22:51,602 --> 00:22:54,205
- I knew about the parts.
- I'm not talking about the parts.

303
00:22:56,642 --> 00:22:58,342
I'm talking about Riley.

304
00:23:04,602 --> 00:23:06,643
Well, there's nothing
to talk about, is there?

305
00:23:06,768 --> 00:23:07,969
Because Riley's dead.

306
00:23:09,078 --> 00:23:10,763
How do you think that happened?

307
00:23:11,393 --> 00:23:12,543
I don't know.

308
00:23:14,205 --> 00:23:16,305
I'm gonna figure it out, though.

309
00:23:16,579 --> 00:23:18,579
You know, John.
We both know.

310
00:23:26,008 --> 00:23:27,322
Cameron didn't do it.

311
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,040
How can you say that?

312
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:31,701
How can you be so sure?

313
00:23:33,282 --> 00:23:34,627
Because I'm sure.

314
00:23:35,758 --> 00:23:37,008
And I know her.

315
00:23:38,895 --> 00:23:40,195
And she told me.

316
00:23:41,437 --> 00:23:42,587
She told you?

317
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:48,904
Just like she told you she destroyed
every part we ever captured?

318
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,555
Just like she tells us what she does
every night when we go to sleep?

319
00:23:53,544 --> 00:23:56,184
When she comes back in the morning,
she's covered in cuts and bruises.

320
00:23:59,231 --> 00:24:01,355
Just like she told you
she loved you?

321
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,770
You don't know anything.

322
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,923
I'm thinking of an herb.

323
00:24:27,971 --> 00:24:29,209
Tarragon?

324
00:24:29,721 --> 00:24:31,185
We're wasting time.

325
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,947
But it's working. His game.

326
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:36,809
What is wrong with you?
Why are you not angry?

327
00:24:38,331 --> 00:24:41,354
Why should I be?
We have a way to get her back.

328
00:24:41,635 --> 00:24:44,232
Tell me where the child is.

329
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:50,450
Look.

330
00:24:50,575 --> 00:24:53,658
You asked me to teach him
ethics, morals, and rules.

331
00:24:54,342 --> 00:24:56,452
What good is it
if he's not gonna follow them?

332
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,021
He will.

333
00:24:58,282 --> 00:25:00,623
If we let him learn the rules
on his own.

334
00:25:07,207 --> 00:25:08,207
Oregano.

335
00:25:09,771 --> 00:25:10,771
Correct.

336
00:25:11,144 --> 00:25:12,144
See there.

337
00:25:12,616 --> 00:25:13,844
A lucky guess.

338
00:25:14,521 --> 00:25:15,583
Lucky.

339
00:25:16,199 --> 00:25:17,549
Give us our clue.

340
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:20,320
The sun is shining on Savannah.

341
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:23,563
Security.

342
00:25:23,821 --> 00:25:27,003
<i>Check near all windows.
Anyplace light is coming through.</i>

343
00:25:27,128 --> 00:25:28,128
Copy.

344
00:25:29,379 --> 00:25:31,179
I'm thinking of an animal.

345
00:25:34,426 --> 00:25:35,324
Antelope.

346
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,300
Lion.

347
00:25:39,145 --> 00:25:40,145
Horse.

348
00:25:40,676 --> 00:25:42,330
- Bird!
- Correct.

349
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:45,462
- Give us our clue.
- The answer is the clue.

350
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:49,172
What?
What does that mean?

351
00:25:49,593 --> 00:25:51,188
Just what he said.

352
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:53,235
Bird is our clue.

353
00:26:13,725 --> 00:26:15,236
I know where she is.

354
00:26:19,861 --> 00:26:22,161
Security.
Meet us at the elevators.

355
00:26:38,609 --> 00:26:40,139
Savannah, are you okay?

356
00:26:50,322 --> 00:26:51,722
Go to your mother.

357
00:26:53,012 --> 00:26:54,726
You found me, mommy.

358
00:26:55,985 --> 00:26:57,235
Yes, darling...

359
00:26:57,859 --> 00:26:58,859
I did.

360
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:11,296
Aaron?

361
00:27:13,422 --> 00:27:14,422
I remember.

362
00:27:16,154 --> 00:27:17,532
Is Riley around?

363
00:27:17,796 --> 00:27:20,096
No, she didn't come home last night.

364
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:22,598
Riley didn't come home.

365
00:27:26,083 --> 00:27:27,172
Thanks.

366
00:27:27,904 --> 00:27:29,021
Foster kids...

367
00:27:31,433 --> 00:27:33,552
That's the way it is
with them sometimes.

368
00:27:33,677 --> 00:27:37,127
They drift into your life,
then they drift back out again.

369
00:27:38,581 --> 00:27:40,531
Not always according to plan.

370
00:27:43,635 --> 00:27:45,079
She's a tough one, too.

371
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,916
Good heart,
as I'm sure you know, but...

372
00:27:50,011 --> 00:27:51,211
tough to know.

373
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,844
I really really needed
to talk to her.

374
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:02,555
I don't know if you could maybe just
take a message for me...

375
00:28:02,772 --> 00:28:05,141
- See, last time that we spoke...
- Hang on a sec.

376
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,650
God, Riley!
Are you all right?

377
00:28:15,257 --> 00:28:17,869
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- Everything's fine.

378
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:22,033
I'm in Riverside, it's a long story.
Everything's fine.

379
00:28:22,433 --> 00:28:24,910
We've been worried sick.
We were about to call the police.

380
00:28:25,107 --> 00:28:27,705
Please don't do that.
Everything's fine.

381
00:28:27,882 --> 00:28:29,290
John, too... he's here.

382
00:28:30,928 --> 00:28:32,728
<i>Really? Can I talk to him?</i>

383
00:28:36,764 --> 00:28:37,764
Me?

384
00:28:41,905 --> 00:28:43,405
You're in Riverside?

385
00:28:46,072 --> 00:28:48,184
Listen... we'll talk...

386
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:49,602
<i>when I see you.</i>

387
00:28:50,633 --> 00:28:52,355
I thought you'd wanna hear my voice.

388
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:57,533
You know you're really
freaking everybody out, right?

389
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,420
Am I freaking you out, now?

390
00:29:05,364 --> 00:29:07,821
- So let's talk later.
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>

391
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:09,546
It's just...

392
00:29:10,196 --> 00:29:12,580
I've been thinking
about my parents a lot.

393
00:29:12,705 --> 00:29:15,140
And there are things
I can't get out of my head.

394
00:29:15,265 --> 00:29:18,631
<i>And I just thought if I came out
and saw where we used to live...</i>

395
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,510
I know...

396
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:22,209
Stupid, right?

397
00:29:23,616 --> 00:29:26,914
We'll talk about all this in person.
When you get back.

398
00:29:31,447 --> 00:29:32,645
We're hanging up now.

399
00:29:35,343 --> 00:29:36,774
Sure. That would be great.

400
00:29:42,512 --> 00:29:43,512
I love you.

401
00:29:56,662 --> 00:29:58,754
- What the hell was that about?
- What was what about?

402
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,172
What happened just now.

403
00:30:01,323 --> 00:30:02,822
It was the plan.

404
00:30:02,947 --> 00:30:05,761
No. The plan was
to call the foster parents.

405
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:08,429
The plan was
to let him hear her voice.

406
00:30:10,458 --> 00:30:11,912
That's what I did.

407
00:30:13,136 --> 00:30:14,786
That's not all you did.

408
00:30:15,324 --> 00:30:17,022
What you did was not the plan.

409
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:20,401
The plan was to make
him think she's still alive...

410
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:22,669
So he wouldn't go to the police.

411
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,322
You became part of that plan.

412
00:30:25,696 --> 00:30:28,065
Your reaction made it
more authentic.

413
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:30,411
Don't you think it was
more authentic that way?

414
00:30:36,577 --> 00:30:37,877
Where are we going now?

415
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,350
We're not going anywhere.

416
00:30:41,267 --> 00:30:42,767
I'm going somewhere.

417
00:30:44,006 --> 00:30:45,426
And I'm gonna go alone.

418
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:48,220
- You shouldn't be alone.
- Yes, I should.

419
00:30:56,637 --> 00:30:59,012
Did you have fun
playing the game, Mr. Ellison?

420
00:30:59,137 --> 00:31:01,525
No, John Henry.
I did not.

421
00:31:02,554 --> 00:31:03,566
Why not?

422
00:31:03,691 --> 00:31:06,113
Because what you did
made me very, very angry.

423
00:31:06,238 --> 00:31:08,977
- I don't understand.
- You kept a secret.

424
00:31:10,339 --> 00:31:11,786
Is it wrong to keep a secret?

425
00:31:12,077 --> 00:31:14,877
The secret you kept
could've harmed Savannah.

426
00:31:15,465 --> 00:31:17,701
What if we couldn't have found her?

427
00:31:17,826 --> 00:31:20,127
What if she'd fallen
from the roof and died?

428
00:31:22,655 --> 00:31:24,700
Then she wouldn't be alive anymore.

429
00:31:24,825 --> 00:31:26,625
And her life is important.

430
00:31:27,953 --> 00:31:29,303
Human life is sacred.

431
00:31:29,699 --> 00:31:32,848
If she had died...
it would've been your fault.

432
00:31:35,075 --> 00:31:36,075
My fault?

433
00:31:36,515 --> 00:31:39,021
Because you were the only one
who knew where she was.

434
00:31:39,881 --> 00:31:42,024
And you made a choice not to tell.

435
00:31:43,139 --> 00:31:44,735
That was the wrong choice.

436
00:31:59,575 --> 00:32:01,325
I'm thinking about Riley.

437
00:32:03,464 --> 00:32:05,427
What the cyborg did to her.

438
00:32:06,607 --> 00:32:07,842
It's a terrible thing.

439
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:09,893
But...

440
00:32:11,178 --> 00:32:14,119
if John realizes
what the metal is...

441
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:16,490
What it really does...

442
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:20,187
Maybe some good can come of it.

443
00:32:22,595 --> 00:32:24,690
Maybe you can help him see that.

444
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:26,630
Good?

445
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,640
An innocent kid is dead.

446
00:32:35,071 --> 00:32:38,221
Because that metal bitch
murdered her in cold blood.

447
00:32:39,201 --> 00:32:41,001
No good comes out of that.

448
00:32:42,547 --> 00:32:43,829
None. Not ever.

449
00:32:47,988 --> 00:32:49,477
You're a good man.

450
00:32:54,988 --> 00:32:55,848
Oh, yeah?

451
00:33:01,369 --> 00:33:03,669
Don't let anyone tell you different.

452
00:33:16,688 --> 00:33:18,329
- Hoo-roo.
- Hoo-roo.

453
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:31,508
We've been bearing 30 degrees
off course for four hours.

454
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:32,968
Into a major Skynet zone.

455
00:33:33,828 --> 00:33:36,639
- What's going on?
- Our new mission required it.

456
00:33:37,521 --> 00:33:39,889
What mission?
Where are we headed?

457
00:33:40,014 --> 00:33:43,187
A deepwater oil platform
near the Indonesian Archipelago.

458
00:33:43,833 --> 00:33:47,816
Lieutenant Dietz and his team will
board the rig and retrieve a package.

459
00:33:48,332 --> 00:33:50,653
We will deliver this package
to Seranno Point.

460
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:53,269
We have important cargo
to take to Perth.

461
00:33:53,394 --> 00:33:56,533
- Components. Vaccines...
- Our orders come from John Connor.

462
00:33:59,642 --> 00:34:01,773
These orders from John Connor...

463
00:34:01,898 --> 00:34:04,554
Do they say what we're after?
What it is?

464
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:07,211
Yes.
They say what the package is.

465
00:34:08,869 --> 00:34:09,838
Right.

466
00:34:14,059 --> 00:34:16,753
Please inform the crew.
Thank you.

467
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:28,351
Just stay sharp, you'll be fine.

468
00:34:28,476 --> 00:34:30,393
I know I'll be fine. I got this.

469
00:34:30,518 --> 00:34:31,968
I'm serious, Dietz.

470
00:34:34,234 --> 00:34:35,948
I'm always serious about being fine.

471
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:37,491
You do me one favor.

472
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:41,704
You see anything you don't like,
you think before you pull that trigger.

473
00:34:43,801 --> 00:34:46,336
I've been seeing things
I don't like since J-Day.

474
00:34:46,461 --> 00:34:49,265
You don't get to be my age
without thinking first.

475
00:34:51,897 --> 00:34:53,145
I swear, Mom.

476
00:34:53,538 --> 00:34:55,926
We'll hold hands
before we cross the street.

477
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:02,972
ASDS has cut engines, Commander.
I think we're clear for comms.

478
00:35:04,528 --> 00:35:06,832
ASDS, this is Carter.
Over.

479
00:35:06,957 --> 00:35:07,987
<i>Hey, Mom.</i>

480
00:35:08,112 --> 00:35:10,394
<i>I'll say this much
about a deep-sea oil rig...</i>

481
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:13,457
<i>Second-worst thing I've ever smelled.
Dark as night out here.</i>

482
00:35:13,582 --> 00:35:15,112
We're gonna keep this channel open.

483
00:35:15,237 --> 00:35:18,209
Maintain radio silence
till you've got the package.

484
00:35:18,334 --> 00:35:19,584
<i>Planning on it.</i>

485
00:37:20,211 --> 00:37:21,461
Connor sent me.

486
00:37:22,193 --> 00:37:23,293
John Connor.

487
00:37:25,861 --> 00:37:27,327
I've come for that.

488
00:37:28,123 --> 00:37:29,204
That's for him.

489
00:37:31,193 --> 00:37:32,499
I'm here to pick it up.

490
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,984
I had planned on waiting for you
with Derek's sniper rifle.

491
00:38:30,248 --> 00:38:31,698
Pulled the trigger.

492
00:38:32,564 --> 00:38:35,854
Solved about 50% of my problems.
One shot.

493
00:38:39,376 --> 00:38:41,576
Do you know how bad I'd have felt?

494
00:38:42,311 --> 00:38:43,311
Very bad.

495
00:38:43,538 --> 00:38:44,788
Not bad at all.

496
00:38:47,062 --> 00:38:49,562
But I know someone
who'd have felt bad.

497
00:38:50,764 --> 00:38:53,205
Someone who'd have never forgiven me
if I'd have done that.

498
00:38:55,609 --> 00:38:57,759
I don't know what to do with you.

499
00:38:59,252 --> 00:39:02,172
You know what the stakes are.
You know why we're here.

500
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:05,383
You know what this means.

501
00:39:06,939 --> 00:39:08,595
And yet, here I stand.

502
00:39:08,764 --> 00:39:11,932
Burning what's left of an endoskeleton
I'd thought we'd burned months ago.

503
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,517
I needed spare parts.

504
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,936
I don't care what you need,
because this is not about you.

505
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:21,108
It's not about me.
It's about John.

506
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:26,113
You're concerned for his safety.

507
00:39:26,885 --> 00:39:29,063
- You bet I am.
- From Skynet.

508
00:39:30,108 --> 00:39:31,034
From me.

509
00:39:31,334 --> 00:39:32,334
Maybe.

510
00:39:33,953 --> 00:39:35,501
Maybe especially you.

511
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:38,380
We're all a threat.

512
00:39:39,703 --> 00:39:41,295
We're all a threat to John.

513
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,126
He worries about us.

514
00:39:45,322 --> 00:39:47,122
That makes him vulnerable.

515
00:39:49,309 --> 00:39:50,309
He cares.

516
00:39:51,952 --> 00:39:53,652
I am not John's problem.

517
00:39:55,189 --> 00:39:56,839
John is John's problem.

518
00:39:57,214 --> 00:39:58,900
Humans are the problem.

519
00:40:01,131 --> 00:40:03,440
There's only one way for him
to be safe.

520
00:40:04,238 --> 00:40:05,694
That's to be alone.

521
00:40:07,186 --> 00:40:08,986
What kind of life is that?

522
00:40:09,995 --> 00:40:11,095
John's life.

523
00:40:12,317 --> 00:40:13,317
Someday.

524
00:42:11,565 --> 00:42:12,565
I'm sorry.
