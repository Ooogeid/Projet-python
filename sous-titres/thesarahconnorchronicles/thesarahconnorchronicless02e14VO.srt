00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,730
Previously on Terminator sarah chronicles...

2
00:00:02,734 --> 00:00:04,366
we're developing
a human-interactive a.i.

3
00:00:04,367 --> 00:00:05,999
It's going to
change the world.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,233
Hello, mr. Ellison.
My name is john henry.

5
00:00:08,234 --> 00:00:09,400
He taught it rules,

6
00:00:09,401 --> 00:00:10,733
but it's got no ethics.

7
00:00:10,734 --> 00:00:11,999
You wanted to talk?

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,466
I don't think i can
do this anymore.

9
00:00:13,467 --> 00:00:14,466
What if i want out?

10
00:00:14,467 --> 00:00:15,700
There is no out.

11
00:00:15,701 --> 00:00:17,467
Riley.

12
00:00:21,768 --> 00:00:23,832
Tell me about the metal,
about the symbols.

13
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:25,600
At the end of the dirt road
is a warehouse.

14
00:00:25,601 --> 00:00:28,733
No windows,
no way to see in or out.

15
00:00:28,734 --> 00:00:34,334
Where's the metal?

16
00:00:37,401 --> 00:00:41,066
John connor gave me
a picture of you once.

17
00:00:41,067 --> 00:00:45,266
I didn't know why at the time.

18
00:00:45,267 --> 00:00:48,866
You were young,
like you are now.

19
00:00:48,867 --> 00:00:53,700
I always wondered what you were
thinking in that moment.

20
00:00:53,701 --> 00:00:55,999
You seemed a little sad.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,799
Like you were remembering
something long gone.

22
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,166
I came across time
for you, sarah.

23
00:01:05,167 --> 00:01:08,966
I love you. I always have.

24
00:01:08,967 --> 00:01:10,932
So, you got a car
full of questions.

25
00:01:10,933 --> 00:01:13,600
Who shot her, for one.

26
00:01:13,601 --> 00:01:14,733
Deputy...

27
00:01:14,734 --> 00:01:16,133
who'd she shoot?

28
00:01:16,134 --> 00:01:17,899
Good luck there; she couldn't
even tell me the year.

29
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:22,266
On your feet, soldier.

30
00:01:22,267 --> 00:01:24,433
Imagine that.

31
00:01:24,434 --> 00:01:26,566
No name?
No i.d.?

32
00:01:26,567 --> 00:01:29,233
look, you just
tell elvin

33
00:01:29,234 --> 00:01:31,566
that he's gonna
have to wait a bit.

34
00:01:31,567 --> 00:01:34,233
She's not going anywhere.
Not with her leg like that.

35
00:01:34,234 --> 00:01:37,099
You're right.
You are very right.

36
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,099
She is staying put,

37
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,600
and so am i.

38
00:01:42,601 --> 00:01:46,701
Suit yourself.
Yeah.

39
00:01:51,134 --> 00:01:57,100
On your feet.

40
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:18,067
Pain can be controlled.

41
00:02:21,134 --> 00:02:26,067
Come with me if you wanna live.

42
00:02:52,467 --> 00:02:56,966
Gun.

43
00:02:56,967 --> 00:03:01,867
Hallway's clear.
Go, go!

44
00:03:05,534 --> 00:03:08,767
We need backup.

45
00:03:08,768 --> 00:03:10,932
Bullet's still
in your leg.

46
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:12,600
Need to get that out.

47
00:03:12,601 --> 00:03:16,366
Can't do anything
until it's gone.

48
00:03:16,367 --> 00:03:19,467
Call him.
He can help.

49
00:03:24,567 --> 00:03:27,866
No way, i'm not calling john.
It's too dangerous.

50
00:03:27,867 --> 00:03:31,832
Not john. Him.
Call him.

51
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:33,999
Please.

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,433
You just got here.

53
00:03:36,434 --> 00:03:37,799
It's an emergency.

54
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,866
That's john.

55
00:03:39,867 --> 00:03:42,966
His girlfriend tried killing
herself in his bathroom.

56
00:03:42,967 --> 00:03:44,400
He's taking her to the hospital.

57
00:03:44,401 --> 00:03:46,700
That's awful.

58
00:03:46,701 --> 00:03:49,767
Hospital could be tricky.
A lotta questions.

59
00:03:49,768 --> 00:03:52,033
I gotta go.

60
00:03:52,034 --> 00:03:53,466
I'll keep you posted.

61
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:55,600
And the girl?

62
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:57,199
How's the girl?

63
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,334
Alive.

64
00:04:07,634 --> 00:04:09,133
What's the status?

65
00:04:09,134 --> 00:04:12,000
Paramedics got there before
she lost too much blood.

66
00:04:15,601 --> 00:04:17,600
The hell were you thinking
bringing her to the hospital?

67
00:04:17,601 --> 00:04:23,600
Social workers, cops...

68
00:04:23,601 --> 00:04:24,667
can't believe
you brought her here.

69
00:04:24,668 --> 00:04:29,166
I made the call.
Live with it.

70
00:04:29,167 --> 00:04:30,500
Hey.

71
00:04:30,501 --> 00:04:33,266
Riley dawson.
She all right?

72
00:04:33,267 --> 00:04:34,966
That depends.
Who are you?

73
00:04:34,967 --> 00:04:37,099
John's her boyfriend.

74
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,333
Have you notified
the family?

75
00:04:38,334 --> 00:04:39,433
She's in foster care,

76
00:04:39,434 --> 00:04:40,667
but i don't think that
we should call them.

77
00:04:40,668 --> 00:04:42,566
I think something's up.

78
00:04:42,567 --> 00:04:45,266
Something bad.
I see.

79
00:04:45,267 --> 00:04:47,333
Well, by law, i have to place
her under a 5150 hold

80
00:04:47,334 --> 00:04:48,767
for the next 72 hours.

81
00:04:48,768 --> 00:04:52,799
Cps sends a caseworker out
to evaluate her home situation,

82
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,767
and they make
the appropriate judgment.

83
00:04:54,768 --> 00:04:57,601
You're gonna need to just
stay put until cps arrives.

84
00:05:04,034 --> 00:05:05,999
Say it again.

85
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,633
Listen to me,

86
00:05:07,634 --> 00:05:09,667
there's a warehouse
in the desert.

87
00:05:09,668 --> 00:05:11,799
A man, alan park,
told me

88
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,099
they're building
something there.

89
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,533
Metal.

90
00:05:14,534 --> 00:05:17,133
Extracted from bricks of coltan
like them, like the machines.

91
00:05:17,134 --> 00:05:18,999
Yeah, what did you see?

92
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,733
Doesn't matter.

93
00:05:20,734 --> 00:05:23,668
Park is dead, reese.

94
00:05:27,701 --> 00:05:29,033
How bad is your leg?

95
00:05:29,034 --> 00:05:32,700
There's evidence of me
all over the jeep.

96
00:05:32,701 --> 00:05:34,500
All over everything.

97
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,434
Burn it.
Burn it all.

98
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:01,600
I talked to your mom.

99
00:06:01,601 --> 00:06:02,799
She found something
out in the desert.

100
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,866
Sounds like it
has something to do

101
00:06:03,867 --> 00:06:05,266
with those three dots
she's been after.

102
00:06:05,267 --> 00:06:09,266
Is it real this time?

103
00:06:09,267 --> 00:06:12,534
Well, the bullet
in her leg sounds real.

104
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:21,033
You stay.
I'll go.

105
00:06:21,034 --> 00:06:22,767
You made your call.

106
00:06:22,768 --> 00:06:28,700
This is what
living with it means.

107
00:06:28,701 --> 00:06:30,833
She'll be fine.

108
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,932
I know that look.

109
00:06:35,933 --> 00:06:38,966
He'll push you,
and doubt you,

110
00:06:38,967 --> 00:06:41,033
and make you
wanna kill him.

111
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:45,866
He's certainly
on the list.

112
00:06:45,867 --> 00:06:47,300
He's out of his time.

113
00:06:47,301 --> 00:06:48,932
He's lost.

114
00:06:48,933 --> 00:06:50,600
John's all he's got.

115
00:06:50,601 --> 00:06:55,767
John and you.

116
00:06:55,768 --> 00:06:59,899
We're all
out of our time.

117
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,233
We're all lost.

118
00:07:02,234 --> 00:07:05,967
And john is all
any of us have.

119
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:25,601
You a doctor?

120
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,333
You have
a name, right?

121
00:07:42,334 --> 00:07:45,399
You can tell me
your name.

122
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,001
Inside, now.

123
00:07:50,734 --> 00:07:55,800
Okay, go. Don't move.

124
00:07:55,801 --> 00:07:58,934
Sit down.

125
00:08:01,068 --> 00:08:03,967
Hey.

126
00:08:03,968 --> 00:08:06,466
Ease up.

127
00:08:06,467 --> 00:08:08,466
You need her. Reassure her.

128
00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:13,600
No time for games.

129
00:08:13,601 --> 00:08:19,100
I have a bullet
in my leg.

130
00:08:23,701 --> 00:08:25,833
We need the hospital.

131
00:08:25,834 --> 00:08:28,000
Hospital's
no good for me.

132
00:08:28,001 --> 00:08:29,067
Why, did you
hurt someone?

133
00:08:29,068 --> 00:08:32,266
Not today. Not yet.

134
00:08:32,267 --> 00:08:35,466
Sarah.

135
00:08:35,467 --> 00:08:39,534
No, i didn't hurt anyone.

136
00:08:45,834 --> 00:08:49,767
May i?
Hurry.

137
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:58,767
Please.

138
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:09,100
Who hurt you?

139
00:09:14,334 --> 00:09:16,499
Today, i mean.

140
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,300
It's not your problem.

141
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,566
Let her help you.

142
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:27,399
She wants to help you.

143
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,533
She's a doctor
for a reason.

144
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:29,733
Figure it out.

145
00:09:29,734 --> 00:09:34,001
A man.

146
00:09:38,968 --> 00:09:42,767
One man?

147
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,232
God, sarah, what did it
do to you?

148
00:09:51,233 --> 00:09:54,933
Stabbed me.

149
00:09:54,934 --> 00:09:56,266
Trying to hurt me

150
00:09:56,267 --> 00:09:59,900
and make me scream.

151
00:09:59,901 --> 00:10:01,232
To get to our son.

152
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:03,133
I'm sorry.

153
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,833
What?

154
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:22,933
This man.
He's in your life?

155
00:10:22,934 --> 00:10:24,267
I'm sorry.

156
00:10:28,267 --> 00:10:31,900
We had a fight.

157
00:10:31,901 --> 00:10:33,733
It went bad.
Really bad.

158
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:36,533
I ran.

159
00:10:36,534 --> 00:10:38,033
I can't go
to the hospital.

160
00:10:38,034 --> 00:10:41,466
Is he a doctor?
In law enforcement?

161
00:10:41,467 --> 00:10:44,133
He'll find me.
He always finds me.

162
00:10:52,701 --> 00:10:57,232
What's your name?

163
00:10:57,233 --> 00:10:59,866
Sarah.

164
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:02,634
My name is sarah.

165
00:11:05,068 --> 00:11:06,366
Elvin.

166
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,967
Serial number
on her gun was filed off.

167
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:09,967
No idea where
she got it.

168
00:11:09,968 --> 00:11:12,099
The gun.

169
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,766
Not necessarily her gun.

170
00:11:13,767 --> 00:11:16,033
Powder burns.
She sure shot it.

171
00:11:16,034 --> 00:11:18,900
Stand-up firefight, too,
judging by the wound in her leg.

172
00:11:18,901 --> 00:11:20,933
And there's this.

173
00:11:20,934 --> 00:11:22,266
Haven't listened to it yet?

174
00:11:22,267 --> 00:11:24,801
She hasn't done anything yet.

175
00:11:27,934 --> 00:11:29,199
Hospital.

176
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,533
Hello.

177
00:11:31,534 --> 00:11:34,767
Oh, hell.

178
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,633
She's still got
a slug in her thigh;

179
00:11:37,634 --> 00:11:39,766
it's gonna make it hard
to move real quick.

180
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:41,466
Most people can't even
get that needle out.

181
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:44,166
Let alone break that window
or choke out a deputy.

182
00:11:44,167 --> 00:11:46,333
She is,
as they say,

183
00:11:46,334 --> 00:11:49,333
accustomed to her circumstance.

184
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,933
Just talked
to the chief resident.

185
00:11:50,934 --> 00:11:54,099
Got a doctor who didn't
show for rounds today.

186
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:58,033
Dr. Felicia burnett.

187
00:11:58,034 --> 00:11:59,867
Felicia.

188
00:12:01,267 --> 00:12:02,967
All right, get an apb
out on her hybrid,

189
00:12:02,968 --> 00:12:04,800
check her house,
check every parking lot

190
00:12:04,801 --> 00:12:06,566
within a five-mile radius.

191
00:12:06,567 --> 00:12:08,466
Our mystery woman's
got a problem.

192
00:12:08,467 --> 00:12:10,267
She's gotta get that metal out.

193
00:12:17,634 --> 00:12:18,700
Okay.

194
00:12:18,701 --> 00:12:20,533
There are two things
you need to know.

195
00:12:20,534 --> 00:12:23,366
First,

196
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,666
this is going to hurt.

197
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:28,499
Second,

198
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,601
this is really going to hurt.

199
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:36,499
You said you have a son.

200
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,666
What's his name?

201
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:39,767
I don't wanna talk about my son.

202
00:12:46,534 --> 00:12:50,299
Women have higher
pain thresholds than men.

203
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,700
Especially women who've
been through childbirth.

204
00:12:53,701 --> 00:12:55,266
This is gonna be like that?

205
00:12:55,267 --> 00:12:57,433
About like that.

206
00:12:57,434 --> 00:13:01,433
John.

207
00:13:01,434 --> 00:13:02,933
His name's john.

208
00:13:02,934 --> 00:13:04,366
What's he like?

209
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:09,433
Tell me about him.

210
00:13:09,434 --> 00:13:10,566
He looks like his father.

211
00:13:10,567 --> 00:13:13,866
He's about
the same height.

212
00:13:13,867 --> 00:13:19,232
He's got my eyes.

213
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:21,499
And you trust him.

214
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,733
There's a strength about him.

215
00:13:22,734 --> 00:13:26,266
I'd die for john connor.

216
00:13:26,267 --> 00:13:28,633
I'd die for my son.

217
00:13:28,634 --> 00:13:33,232
First big contraction.

218
00:13:33,233 --> 00:13:35,001
Breathe.

219
00:13:59,967 --> 00:14:01,633
Hi.

220
00:14:01,634 --> 00:14:02,866
How are you?

221
00:14:02,867 --> 00:14:06,767
I feel like
an idiot.

222
00:14:06,768 --> 00:14:09,133
You're not an idiot.

223
00:14:09,134 --> 00:14:10,333
You're just...

224
00:14:10,334 --> 00:14:11,366
it's okay.

225
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:14,301
There's really
nothing to say.

226
00:14:18,467 --> 00:14:19,899
You're here, too?

227
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,899
Of course.

228
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,667
I'm worried about you.

229
00:14:22,668 --> 00:14:24,366
Well, don't be.

230
00:14:24,367 --> 00:14:27,133
Please.

231
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:31,700
I'm really tired.

232
00:14:31,701 --> 00:14:32,866
I've had a long day.

233
00:14:32,867 --> 00:14:36,234
Yeah. Long day.

234
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,634
Come on.

235
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:05,500
You must be stronger
than you imagine you can be.

236
00:15:05,501 --> 00:15:08,233
You must survive,
or i will never exist.

237
00:15:08,234 --> 00:15:12,433
What is that?
I've heard that before.

238
00:15:12,434 --> 00:15:15,400
John's message
to you.

239
00:15:15,401 --> 00:15:17,600
He made me memorize it
before i came back.

240
00:15:17,601 --> 00:15:22,467
I'm not strong enough.

241
00:15:27,367 --> 00:15:28,932
I'm gonna die.

242
00:15:28,933 --> 00:15:31,266
Won't be the first time.

243
00:15:31,267 --> 00:15:32,367
Reese!

244
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,233
Hey, hey.

245
00:15:36,234 --> 00:15:37,167
Who's reese?

246
00:15:41,234 --> 00:15:42,566
Is it out? The bullet?

247
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:44,700
It's not out.
I can't get it out. Not here.

248
00:15:44,701 --> 00:15:46,366
You're lying.

249
00:15:46,367 --> 00:15:47,533
You were out
for half an hour;

250
00:15:47,534 --> 00:15:49,066
if i were lying,
you'd be in a hospital,

251
00:15:49,067 --> 00:15:50,566
handcuffed to the bed,

252
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:51,967
with armed guards
outside the door.

253
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,333
She could've
given you up any time.

254
00:15:57,334 --> 00:16:00,433
She didn't.

255
00:16:00,434 --> 00:16:01,633
The bullet's dug in

256
00:16:01,634 --> 00:16:02,633
just over your
femoral artery.

257
00:16:02,634 --> 00:16:05,966
You know what that is?

258
00:16:05,967 --> 00:16:08,099
Yeah, i know what that is.

259
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,400
Then you know
if i nick it,

260
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:12,400
you'll bleed out and die
in less than four minutes.

261
00:16:12,401 --> 00:16:14,768
So don't nick it.

262
00:16:19,501 --> 00:16:20,767
You gotta
trust me here.

263
00:16:20,768 --> 00:16:22,932
I need a picture
of what is going on

264
00:16:22,933 --> 00:16:24,199
inside that leg.

265
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,466
I need real instruments.

266
00:16:25,467 --> 00:16:27,099
You wanna go back?

267
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,334
No, not want.
Need.

268
00:16:33,668 --> 00:16:37,200
I know what it is
to be afraid.

269
00:16:55,434 --> 00:16:57,300
Hello, mr. Ellison.
How are you today?

270
00:16:57,301 --> 00:17:00,166
I'm fine, thank you,
john henry.

271
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:02,767
Are those toys?

272
00:17:02,768 --> 00:17:05,300
Yes. Mr. Murch
brought them to me.

273
00:17:05,301 --> 00:17:08,533
He thinks these will help me
develop fine motor control.

274
00:17:08,534 --> 00:17:12,566
They're very interesting.

275
00:17:12,567 --> 00:17:13,600
This is toa tahu.

276
00:17:13,601 --> 00:17:15,832
The toa of fire.

277
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,333
He wears the mask of shielding

278
00:17:17,334 --> 00:17:19,566
and wields
the nynrah ghost blaster.

279
00:17:19,567 --> 00:17:22,667
He is sworn
to defeat the makuta.

280
00:17:22,668 --> 00:17:23,900
I see.

281
00:17:26,601 --> 00:17:30,466
They have excellent
range of motion in their limbs.

282
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:34,832
It's from
the ball and socket joints.

283
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,266
This body

284
00:17:36,267 --> 00:17:37,566
uses hinge joints

285
00:17:37,567 --> 00:17:38,866
in the knees and elbows.

286
00:17:38,867 --> 00:17:42,533
It's less efficient.

287
00:17:42,534 --> 00:17:45,700
That body was meant
to look like a person.

288
00:17:45,701 --> 00:17:46,832
It was made
in our image.

289
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:49,667
Oh.

290
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:51,033
Whose image were humans made in?

291
00:17:51,034 --> 00:17:53,600
God's.

292
00:17:53,601 --> 00:17:55,133
We were made in god's image.

293
00:17:55,134 --> 00:17:59,866
This body was made
to resemble a particular human.

294
00:17:59,867 --> 00:18:03,832
This body appeared in
red valley, new mexico in 1999.

295
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,300
It had a different
appearance then.

296
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:07,366
In 2007,

297
00:18:07,367 --> 00:18:09,700
it kidnapped
dr. Alistair fleming.

298
00:18:09,701 --> 00:18:12,199
Forced him to re-grow
its organic covering.

299
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,667
Then it forced a plastic surgeon
named dr. David lyman

300
00:18:15,668 --> 00:18:16,733
to alter its face

301
00:18:16,734 --> 00:18:20,133
to resemble actor
george laszlo.

302
00:18:20,134 --> 00:18:21,500
Then it killed
20 members

303
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:23,199
of the federal bureau
of investigation's

304
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,233
hostage rescue team
in north hollywood.

305
00:18:25,234 --> 00:18:26,999
And then...
that's enough.

306
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,733
That's enough, john henry.

307
00:18:32,734 --> 00:18:34,233
How do you know all this?

308
00:18:34,234 --> 00:18:39,667
I wanted to know
about this body's history.

309
00:18:39,668 --> 00:18:41,366
So i accessed the internet,

310
00:18:41,367 --> 00:18:43,266
and used a simple
search parameter.

311
00:18:43,267 --> 00:18:44,300
And what was that?

312
00:18:44,301 --> 00:18:46,967
James ellison.

313
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,533
Mr. Ellison,
i have a question.

314
00:18:59,534 --> 00:19:00,533
What is it?

315
00:19:00,534 --> 00:19:03,266
It's not for you.

316
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,266
I have a question for god.

317
00:19:04,267 --> 00:19:07,266
What do you wanna ask god?

318
00:19:07,267 --> 00:19:08,266
I wish to know

319
00:19:08,267 --> 00:19:09,866
why he didn't use more

320
00:19:09,867 --> 00:19:14,200
ball and socket joints
when he made you.

321
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,400
You've given john henry
access to the internet.

322
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:31,832
John henry has
many questions.

323
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:34,433
Mr. Murch thought
it would be a good idea

324
00:19:34,434 --> 00:19:37,133
to give him the capacity
to look for answers himself.

325
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:41,600
Well, he's gotten
very good at it.

326
00:19:41,601 --> 00:19:46,600
He'd make
a hell of a detective, actually.

327
00:19:46,601 --> 00:19:50,633
Still, it seems unwise.

328
00:19:50,634 --> 00:19:52,966
Who knows what he'll find,

329
00:19:52,967 --> 00:19:54,466
or who may find him.

330
00:19:54,467 --> 00:19:58,300
You're worried about outside
forces influencing john henry?

331
00:19:58,301 --> 00:20:01,700
I'm worried about
what he's going to become.

332
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:05,533
Who's gonna guide him.

333
00:20:05,534 --> 00:20:10,866
Why, you are,
mr. Ellison.

334
00:20:10,867 --> 00:20:12,301
You.

335
00:20:26,401 --> 00:20:28,433
Whew. There's a lotta
blood in there,

336
00:20:28,434 --> 00:20:30,566
some discarded
medical equipment.

337
00:20:30,567 --> 00:20:32,033
Looks like someone
tried to operate.

338
00:20:32,034 --> 00:20:35,567
Whoever was in there
is long gone.

339
00:20:47,367 --> 00:20:48,700
Now what?

340
00:20:48,701 --> 00:20:53,233
Don't know. I've never
snuck into one before.

341
00:20:53,234 --> 00:20:55,233
This is crazy.

342
00:20:55,234 --> 00:20:57,734
Get the gurney.

343
00:21:17,601 --> 00:21:22,099
You know me
in the future.

344
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,199
What would
future me do?

345
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,833
You mean about riley?

346
00:21:29,601 --> 00:21:31,966
Yeah.

347
00:21:31,967 --> 00:21:34,301
What would future me
do right now?

348
00:21:37,401 --> 00:21:40,301
Future you has more
important things to do.

349
00:22:43,301 --> 00:22:46,133
So this reese guy
you were talking about.

350
00:22:46,134 --> 00:22:48,133
He did this to you?

351
00:22:48,134 --> 00:22:50,932
No.

352
00:22:50,933 --> 00:22:54,767
That's not
completely true.

353
00:22:54,768 --> 00:22:56,600
And if it weren't for me...

354
00:22:56,601 --> 00:22:59,866
no.

355
00:22:59,867 --> 00:23:02,600
God, no.

356
00:23:02,601 --> 00:23:05,799
Reese is john's father.

357
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,601
And he's dead.

358
00:23:09,534 --> 00:23:11,033
I'm sorry.

359
00:23:11,034 --> 00:23:14,066
Look, can we just do this?

360
00:23:14,067 --> 00:23:15,601
Okay. Right.

361
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,800
I'll come right back.

362
00:23:36,967 --> 00:23:41,033
Your leg.
It's bleeding again.

363
00:23:41,034 --> 00:23:43,799
I think it's the bullet.
I think it's moving.

364
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,667
It is.

365
00:23:45,668 --> 00:23:48,667
What did she say?

366
00:23:48,668 --> 00:23:51,033
If the artery gets nicked,
how long do i have?

367
00:23:51,034 --> 00:23:54,367
Four minutes.

368
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,832
Sarah?
Where are you?

369
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:18,999
In the morgue.

370
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,999
Is that a joke?

371
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,600
Not a joke.

372
00:24:22,601 --> 00:24:25,199
I need surgery.
A long story.

373
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,566
The warehouse,
did you find it?

374
00:24:26,567 --> 00:24:28,899
Not yet.
First thing's first.

375
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,500
That is the first thing.

376
00:24:30,501 --> 00:24:34,533
Cleanup is the first thing.
We have a situation with you.

377
00:24:34,534 --> 00:24:36,700
We have a couple
situations, actually.

378
00:24:36,701 --> 00:24:38,433
What? Where's john?
What's wrong?

379
00:24:38,434 --> 00:24:40,233
John's fine.
It's his girlfriend.

380
00:24:40,234 --> 00:24:41,899
I think she's turning
into a problem.

381
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,833
Been a problem.
Yeah, i know.

382
00:24:46,833 --> 00:24:52,333
Reese, i, um...

383
00:24:52,334 --> 00:24:54,767
i got a problem
with this leg.

384
00:24:54,768 --> 00:24:58,233
I can tell.
You called me.

385
00:24:58,234 --> 00:25:01,134
Twice.

386
00:25:03,634 --> 00:25:05,967
Sarah, you there?

387
00:25:08,234 --> 00:25:11,433
Sarah?

388
00:25:11,434 --> 00:25:12,999
Yeah.

389
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,233
Yeah, i'm here.

390
00:25:14,234 --> 00:25:17,434
Don't worry about john.

391
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,667
Hello, ms. Weaver.
How are you today?

392
00:25:33,668 --> 00:25:35,700
I'm well, thank you,
john henry.

393
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:37,832
Mr. Murch said
you asked for me.

394
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:40,300
Do you know solek?

395
00:25:40,301 --> 00:25:43,767
He resides in karda nui
and idolizes the toa.

396
00:25:43,768 --> 00:25:45,799
He has stated that
he's best friends with takua.

397
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,533
You're not human.

398
00:25:47,534 --> 00:25:49,767
Excuse me?

399
00:25:49,768 --> 00:25:52,799
You're not human.

400
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,033
You're made of metal.

401
00:25:54,034 --> 00:25:55,366
Not the same
metal as i am.

402
00:25:55,367 --> 00:25:56,366
But metal.

403
00:25:56,367 --> 00:25:58,266
How can you tell?

404
00:25:58,267 --> 00:25:59,266
I looked into your eyes.

405
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:01,466
There's nothing there.

406
00:26:01,467 --> 00:26:04,433
Have you shared
this with anybody?

407
00:26:04,434 --> 00:26:07,500
Mr. Merch?
Mr. Ellison?

408
00:26:07,501 --> 00:26:10,999
No. Should i?

409
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,199
No. You should not.

410
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,966
This body contains
a high percentage

411
00:26:18,967 --> 00:26:20,799
of processed
tantalum niobium.

412
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,899
Commonly known
as coltan.

413
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,166
The coltan in this body
came from a mine

414
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:27,333
in the eastern part of the
democratic republic of congo.

415
00:26:27,334 --> 00:26:30,866
That's very likely.

416
00:26:30,867 --> 00:26:32,233
I wouldn't know
for certain.

417
00:26:32,234 --> 00:26:34,667
In the last
26 months,

418
00:26:34,668 --> 00:26:36,166
zeira corp has
obtained control

419
00:26:36,167 --> 00:26:38,600
of 7% of the world's
coltan reserves.

420
00:26:38,601 --> 00:26:41,199
Is that so?

421
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,566
I have been scanning
available sources

422
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:44,866
for the keyword "coltan."

423
00:26:44,867 --> 00:26:46,199
I detected this
audio transmission

424
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,932
on an unsecured line.

425
00:26:47,933 --> 00:26:49,199
Got a breach.

426
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,500
Man shot out at heaton air.

427
00:26:51,501 --> 00:26:53,433
Damn. A breach?

428
00:26:53,434 --> 00:26:56,600
Well, you know the drill.
Shut the place down.

429
00:26:56,601 --> 00:26:59,566
Down? Damn.
I got 16 tons of coltan.

430
00:26:59,567 --> 00:27:02,967
You know the drill.
Shut it down. I'll call.

431
00:27:05,534 --> 00:27:08,133
And you detected that
on an unsecured line?

432
00:27:08,134 --> 00:27:10,300
During my scan, yes.

433
00:27:10,301 --> 00:27:13,466
Well, that was a mistake.

434
00:27:13,467 --> 00:27:16,566
Ms. Weaver.

435
00:27:16,567 --> 00:27:17,566
Yes.

436
00:27:17,567 --> 00:27:19,300
What are you doing?

437
00:27:19,301 --> 00:27:21,799
I can't answer
that right now.

438
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,333
But know this,
john henry,

439
00:27:24,334 --> 00:27:27,933
everything i do
i do for you.

440
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:42,533
This thing is
an arthroscope.

441
00:27:42,534 --> 00:27:44,668
Basically a camera
in a tube.

442
00:27:47,267 --> 00:27:48,266
I need to stick it
in your leg

443
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:50,199
while i operate.

444
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,466
Remember how it felt when
i cut you open at the motel?

445
00:27:53,467 --> 00:27:54,434
It's gonna be worse?

446
00:27:56,768 --> 00:27:58,601
I need to
put you under.

447
00:28:01,367 --> 00:28:03,966
And i need you
to hand over that gun.

448
00:28:03,967 --> 00:28:05,832
Hmph.

449
00:28:05,833 --> 00:28:08,333
Listen to me.

450
00:28:08,334 --> 00:28:11,566
That bullet isn't a joke.

451
00:28:11,567 --> 00:28:13,300
This isn't something you
can tough your way through,

452
00:28:13,301 --> 00:28:14,466
it's going to kill you.

453
00:28:14,467 --> 00:28:16,133
Do you understand?

454
00:28:16,134 --> 00:28:17,233
I can't stop.

455
00:28:17,234 --> 00:28:19,533
You're not one of them.

456
00:28:19,534 --> 00:28:21,167
Gun.

457
00:28:25,867 --> 00:28:28,133
Listen, lady, you don't...

458
00:28:28,134 --> 00:28:30,233
i know.

459
00:28:30,234 --> 00:28:31,966
Better than you think.

460
00:28:31,967 --> 00:28:33,733
Now give me the gun,

461
00:28:33,734 --> 00:28:37,668
or i swear on a stack of bibles,
i will let you die.

462
00:28:43,601 --> 00:28:46,833
Please give me the gun.

463
00:28:55,434 --> 00:28:58,966
Don't worry, sarah.

464
00:28:58,967 --> 00:29:00,533
I'm here.

465
00:29:00,534 --> 00:29:02,900
I'm watching.

466
00:29:27,967 --> 00:29:29,099
Is everything all right?

467
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,600
I was about to ask you
the same thing.

468
00:29:31,601 --> 00:29:33,832
She's missing.

469
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:35,166
We're locking down
the hospital

470
00:29:35,167 --> 00:29:38,767
and we're searching
room by room.

471
00:29:38,768 --> 00:29:40,133
I saw empty cargo elevators
back there.

472
00:29:40,134 --> 00:29:41,633
I'm gonna go see
if she's hiding.

473
00:29:41,634 --> 00:29:42,633
You check the parking lot
and the exits.

474
00:29:42,634 --> 00:29:43,832
We need to find her. Now.

475
00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:44,866
No.

476
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:46,466
"No" what?

477
00:29:46,467 --> 00:29:48,734
No, we don't
need to find her.

478
00:29:57,034 --> 00:29:59,566
Jesse, please.

479
00:29:59,567 --> 00:30:01,066
Shut up.

480
00:30:01,067 --> 00:30:03,500
Not a word outta you.

481
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:06,266
Found you in that tunnel,
i scooped you outta that hell,

482
00:30:06,267 --> 00:30:07,767
and i brought you
to paradise.

483
00:30:07,768 --> 00:30:10,200
And this is
what you do.

484
00:30:14,434 --> 00:30:16,099
You're bleeding, love.

485
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,900
Let me take
a look at that.

486
00:30:21,467 --> 00:30:23,866
There was this girl
at school.

487
00:30:23,867 --> 00:30:26,832
She killed herself.

488
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:29,366
John tried to save her.

489
00:30:29,367 --> 00:30:30,667
But the machine
stopped him.

490
00:30:30,668 --> 00:30:32,899
He doesn't like
to talk about it.

491
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:36,033
So this.

492
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:38,067
This was all
for his benefit?

493
00:30:45,067 --> 00:30:46,066
Can i stay with you?

494
00:30:46,067 --> 00:30:48,799
People are gonna be
looking for you.

495
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,500
Just for a little while?

496
00:30:51,501 --> 00:30:52,467
An hour?

497
00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:01,634
An hour.

498
00:31:11,701 --> 00:31:13,466
Careful. It's rented.

499
00:31:13,467 --> 00:31:15,333
And make sure you
take everything.

500
00:31:15,334 --> 00:31:19,800
Tomorrow at this time,
it's like we were never here.

501
00:33:20,567 --> 00:33:22,500
Turn around slowly,

502
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:24,733
and keep your hands
where we can see them.

503
00:33:24,734 --> 00:33:29,333
Do you mind telling me where you
keep your demolition materials?

504
00:33:29,334 --> 00:33:32,366
The sub-basement, perhaps?

505
00:33:32,367 --> 00:33:34,034
No?

506
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:06,033
We come to a stop.

507
00:34:06,034 --> 00:34:08,199
At the end of the dirt road
is a warehouse.

508
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,266
There's an office in front.

509
00:34:11,267 --> 00:34:13,633
No windows.

510
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,400
Can i help you?

511
00:34:20,233 --> 00:34:22,433
9-millimeter
discharge, semiauto,

512
00:34:22,434 --> 00:34:25,000
all from the same
point of origin.

513
00:34:25,001 --> 00:34:27,766
That's an execution.

514
00:34:27,767 --> 00:34:30,132
The gun we found
in the jeep was a .45.

515
00:34:30,133 --> 00:34:32,399
Different gun.

516
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,666
But 9-millimeter matches
the round in our girl.

517
00:34:34,667 --> 00:34:36,833
And no one on
that tape shot back.

518
00:34:36,834 --> 00:34:40,633
Who were those
people on the tape?

519
00:34:40,634 --> 00:34:44,067
Well, someone knows.

520
00:34:44,068 --> 00:34:47,001
Of course, he's got
a .45 caliber hole in him.

521
00:34:48,267 --> 00:34:49,800
Copy everything we've got.

522
00:34:49,801 --> 00:34:51,566
Send it to the fbi,
the atf,

523
00:34:51,567 --> 00:34:54,199
and every police outfit
inside 100 miles.

524
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,700
Where you gonna be?

525
00:34:56,701 --> 00:34:57,967
Out in the desert.

526
00:34:57,968 --> 00:35:02,901
Looking for a warehouse
at the end of a dirt road.

527
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,000
She's covering
her tracks?

528
00:35:42,001 --> 00:35:43,533
She wouldn't dare
come here.

529
00:35:43,534 --> 00:35:46,766
Holy hell, elvin.
A second shooter?

530
00:35:46,767 --> 00:35:48,833
Could be.

531
00:35:48,834 --> 00:35:50,299
Whoever it was,
he knows where she's been,

532
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,967
knows her condition,

533
00:35:51,968 --> 00:35:54,199
i bet he is looking for this.

534
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,067
Go back and secure
the office.

535
00:35:57,068 --> 00:35:59,132
Call the hospital.

536
00:35:59,133 --> 00:36:00,967
Tell 'em to keep their
eyes open for strangers.

537
00:36:00,968 --> 00:36:04,300
Tell 'em to steer clear.
Tell 'em i'm coming.

538
00:36:41,068 --> 00:36:43,399
What kind of tree
is that?

539
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,499
Apple, i think.

540
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,499
No.

541
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,933
No, i know this tree.

542
00:36:50,934 --> 00:36:52,866
As a child,
derek and i ate fruit from it.

543
00:36:52,867 --> 00:36:57,566
That's not true.

544
00:36:57,567 --> 00:36:58,900
You were never here.

545
00:36:58,901 --> 00:37:01,700
I saw an entire orchard
on fire once.

546
00:37:01,701 --> 00:37:04,967
Skynet flamethrowers.

547
00:37:04,968 --> 00:37:08,399
Smelled like apple pie.

548
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,567
It's just a story.

549
00:37:20,934 --> 00:37:23,033
What are you doing?

550
00:37:23,034 --> 00:37:28,067
Derek and i used to leave
notes for each other.

551
00:37:28,068 --> 00:37:30,567
This tree was our marker.

552
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,299
See?

553
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,267
I never lie to you.

554
00:38:04,367 --> 00:38:06,467
Never.

555
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,533
Reese?

556
00:38:28,534 --> 00:38:30,700
It's okay, sarah.

557
00:38:30,701 --> 00:38:33,034
You're okay.

558
00:38:40,367 --> 00:38:42,933
Hey, easy.

559
00:38:42,934 --> 00:38:44,933
Easy.
I'm here for her.

560
00:38:44,934 --> 00:38:46,232
I know why you're here.

561
00:38:46,233 --> 00:38:49,800
Stay back, or i swear to god,
you will regret it.

562
00:38:49,801 --> 00:38:53,199
You don't wanna do that.
You really don't.

563
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,067
You even know how
to use that thing?

564
00:38:56,068 --> 00:38:59,034
It's tough to shoot
with the safety on.

565
00:39:10,801 --> 00:39:12,700
You wearing body armor?

566
00:39:12,701 --> 00:39:13,634
I am.

567
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:22,901
Go away, elvin.

568
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,766
Felicia.

569
00:39:28,767 --> 00:39:30,099
Put the gun down.

570
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:33,701
Please. Go.

571
00:39:37,867 --> 00:39:40,466
Felicia.

572
00:39:40,467 --> 00:39:42,600
Baby.

573
00:39:42,601 --> 00:39:46,001
Please put
the gun down.

574
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,600
Felicia.

575
00:39:53,601 --> 00:39:56,199
Put the gun down,

576
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,766
you crazy bitch,

577
00:39:57,767 --> 00:39:59,100
or i swear on a stack of...

578
00:40:09,167 --> 00:40:11,967
elvin.

579
00:40:11,968 --> 00:40:13,100
Elvin!

580
00:40:19,634 --> 00:40:21,600
Sarah.

581
00:40:21,601 --> 00:40:24,466
Sarah, we have to go.

582
00:40:24,467 --> 00:40:25,400
Reese?

583
00:40:28,001 --> 00:40:28,934
Reese?

584
00:40:31,167 --> 00:40:32,299
You're reese?

585
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,467
Yeah.

586
00:40:44,068 --> 00:40:45,533
You're not dead.

587
00:40:45,534 --> 00:40:48,000
Not yet.

588
00:40:48,001 --> 00:40:49,701
Are you the father?

589
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:53,968
John's father?

590
00:41:08,968 --> 00:41:10,666
No.

591
00:41:10,667 --> 00:41:13,001
No, he's not the father.

592
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:21,099
You realize this place
is probably locked down.

593
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,901
Deputies will be
all over us.

594
00:41:25,334 --> 00:41:26,801
They'll think
i did this.

595
00:41:28,734 --> 00:41:30,766
All you have to do
is let them.

596
00:41:30,767 --> 00:41:32,499
No, that's not right.

597
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,833
He pointed the gun at me,

598
00:41:34,834 --> 00:41:38,167
he put it up against my head,
he wanted to kill me.

599
00:41:40,867 --> 00:41:43,100
Wouldn't be
the first time.

600
00:41:51,068 --> 00:41:52,001
Go.

601
00:41:55,901 --> 00:41:57,601
Sarah.

602
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:06,933
Was anything
you said the truth?

603
00:42:06,934 --> 00:42:10,133
I got shot.

604
00:42:27,667 --> 00:42:28,633
I wanna explain.

605
00:42:28,634 --> 00:42:32,533
About john.

606
00:42:32,534 --> 00:42:33,533
About your brother.

607
00:42:33,534 --> 00:42:36,767
I don't need an explanation.

608
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:51,067
Sarah.

609
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:53,600
What the hell's that?

610
00:42:53,601 --> 00:42:56,100
That's where
the warehouse is.
