00:00:00,413 --> 00:00:03,548
<i>Previously on</i> Terminator:
The Sarah Connor Chronicles...

2
00:00:04,699 --> 00:00:06,968
When is the time for me

3
00:00:07,128 --> 00:00:08,553
to live my life?

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,389
Do you know what's extremely rare
in the world of computers?

5
00:00:11,549 --> 00:00:14,142
Finding one that will cross
against the light.

6
00:00:14,385 --> 00:00:16,686
I'd like to talk to you
about an opportunity.

7
00:00:16,846 --> 00:00:19,206
I'd like my company to lead the world
into the next century.

8
00:00:19,326 --> 00:00:21,815
And I'm fairly sure
you're an avenging angel.

9
00:00:27,305 --> 00:00:30,112
<i>My father slept with a gun
under his pillow.</i>

10
00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:33,578
<i>There was no pill for his sickness,</i>

11
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:35,830
<i>no medicine to ease his mind.</i>

12
00:00:38,243 --> 00:00:42,045
<i>He left blood, and sweat,
and part of his soul in a foreign land.</i>

13
00:00:43,256 --> 00:00:45,965
<i>My father never talked to me
about the war he fought.</i>

14
00:00:46,227 --> 00:00:47,676
<i>He never talked to anyone.</i>

15
00:00:47,836 --> 00:00:49,731
<i>Ever vigilant, ever silent.</i>

16
00:00:50,004 --> 00:00:51,235
Anyone here?

17
00:00:51,355 --> 00:00:53,223
<i>I never thought
I'd follow in his footsteps.</i>

18
00:01:08,413 --> 00:01:11,717
Dr. Boyd Sherman.
Child psychologist. Family therapist.

19
00:01:12,064 --> 00:01:13,890
What's his link to Skynet,
friend or foe?

20
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,809
- Don't know.
- Skynet doesn't have friends.

21
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:20,041
It's got foes, and whatever
the opposite of foes are, okay?

22
00:01:20,774 --> 00:01:21,668
Friends.

23
00:01:21,828 --> 00:01:24,988
Look, we don't know anything here.
All we know is his name's on the list.

24
00:01:25,313 --> 00:01:28,622
Everyone we've found on the list
was a target and needed protecting.

25
00:01:28,742 --> 00:01:30,473
Not everyone needs protecting.

26
00:01:30,593 --> 00:01:32,587
- Some need...
- We don't know anything yet.

27
00:01:40,656 --> 00:01:42,439
Turn your head a 1/4 inch.

28
00:01:43,452 --> 00:01:44,232
Perfect.

29
00:01:46,014 --> 00:01:47,416
Another 1/2 inch.

30
00:01:48,605 --> 00:01:49,486
Perfect.

31
00:01:51,065 --> 00:01:52,240
And a smile now.

32
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:58,346
Warmer if you can.
Warmer. Warmer.

33
00:01:59,783 --> 00:02:00,884
Never mind.

34
00:02:01,278 --> 00:02:02,625
Quarter inch to the left.

35
00:02:03,559 --> 00:02:04,544
Perfect.

36
00:02:05,891 --> 00:02:07,589
Could we get the child in
for a few?

37
00:02:14,691 --> 00:02:17,140
You wanna be in the pictures
with mommy?

38
00:02:22,388 --> 00:02:23,646
Looks like fun.

39
00:02:23,807 --> 00:02:25,112
No, it doesn't.

40
00:02:27,185 --> 00:02:28,735
Savannah, sit here with me.

41
00:02:34,985 --> 00:02:36,335
Sit here with me.

42
00:02:40,615 --> 00:02:42,613
- Ma'am.
- Sit here with me.

43
00:02:43,354 --> 00:02:46,002
Ma'am,
maybe we shouldn't force it.

44
00:03:02,626 --> 00:03:03,728
You have a child.

45
00:03:04,124 --> 00:03:05,124
Yes.

46
00:03:06,309 --> 00:03:07,732
What do you do with it?

47
00:03:08,312 --> 00:03:09,312
It?

48
00:03:09,712 --> 00:03:11,370
He, Leo.

49
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,572
He had some issues
during my divorce.

50
00:03:15,124 --> 00:03:17,157
Some days
I wanted to kill him.

51
00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:19,566
But we went to someone.

52
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,584
A real miracle worker.
I can get you the number.

53
00:03:24,861 --> 00:03:26,042
Who wants to start?

54
00:03:33,057 --> 00:03:35,552
I'm not sure therapy is for us,
no offense.

55
00:03:35,893 --> 00:03:37,241
None taken.

56
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,514
Maybe if you tell us
a little about yourself.

57
00:03:39,674 --> 00:03:42,833
Well, I've been a family counselor
for twenty years.

58
00:03:42,953 --> 00:03:45,758
I started my work
up in northern California.

59
00:03:46,305 --> 00:03:48,608
Up north? Silicon Valley?

60
00:03:48,933 --> 00:03:50,879
Livermore. VA Med Center.

61
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,081
Military?

62
00:03:53,303 --> 00:03:54,923
Since I've moved down here,

63
00:03:55,043 --> 00:03:57,615
I've treated civilians
almost exclusively.

64
00:03:57,873 --> 00:04:00,493
Iraq's changing that, however.

65
00:04:00,994 --> 00:04:03,397
Do you have family in the military?

66
00:04:03,863 --> 00:04:04,870
Your dad?

67
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:06,538
He passed away.

68
00:04:07,559 --> 00:04:08,756
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:12,297
Is that something
you'd all like to discuss?

70
00:04:12,457 --> 00:04:15,592
It was a long time ago.
We've been on our own for so time.

71
00:04:16,161 --> 00:04:17,719
That must be difficult.

72
00:04:18,036 --> 00:04:19,386
You get used to it.

73
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,555
Do you?

74
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,015
I'm used to it.

75
00:04:23,414 --> 00:04:24,414
It's fine.

76
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,313
Is there anything else
I should know?

77
00:04:28,474 --> 00:04:30,424
Anything else
we should know?

78
00:04:31,993 --> 00:04:34,861
If we choose to go forward,

79
00:04:36,022 --> 00:04:39,529
I'd like to meet with each of you
individually.

80
00:04:40,921 --> 00:04:43,161
Is that something
you'd be open to?

81
00:04:43,321 --> 00:04:46,039
I could do tomorrow
if you're up for it.

82
00:04:46,414 --> 00:04:47,853
Tomorrow's good.

83
00:04:55,698 --> 00:04:57,592
- Can you hold that, please?
- Sir,

84
00:04:57,752 --> 00:05:00,947
you're gonna have to take another one.
That elevator's full.

85
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:06,309
Show me a tree.

86
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:08,945
Happy.

87
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,073
Funny.

88
00:05:16,977 --> 00:05:18,678
Hit the lights, please.

89
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:21,969
It's an unanticipated response
in the symbolistic software.

90
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:25,904
The AI keeps giving us random,
unsolicited images.

91
00:05:26,024 --> 00:05:29,415
We don't know what they mean
or why it continues

92
00:05:29,576 --> 00:05:31,076
to respond this way.

93
00:05:31,847 --> 00:05:34,212
What we do know is
that when we run performance tests

94
00:05:34,372 --> 00:05:37,097
on the AI,
its computational time is increasing

95
00:05:37,217 --> 00:05:39,633
while the optimality
of its outputs is decreasing.

96
00:05:39,795 --> 00:05:41,595
It's taking more time to do less.

97
00:05:41,715 --> 00:05:43,821
Yeah, you could say that.
Yes.

98
00:05:44,213 --> 00:05:45,306
I just did.

99
00:05:54,134 --> 00:05:56,336
A lot of children come to see me.

100
00:05:57,296 --> 00:06:00,193
They all have something
that's bothering them.

101
00:06:01,732 --> 00:06:04,742
Sometimes they know what it is.
Sometimes they don't.

102
00:06:05,477 --> 00:06:07,979
It helps if we talk
about those things.

103
00:06:16,573 --> 00:06:18,381
Your shoes are untied.

104
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,842
Do you know how to tie them?

105
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:25,179
Would you like me to show you?

106
00:06:40,073 --> 00:06:41,074
So...

107
00:06:42,372 --> 00:06:43,990
Let's see what we have here.

108
00:06:47,354 --> 00:06:48,119
Dolls.

109
00:06:49,985 --> 00:06:51,286
Coloring books.

110
00:06:51,743 --> 00:06:54,824
Look, and we have, a set of cards

111
00:06:55,786 --> 00:06:56,878
with faces.

112
00:06:59,832 --> 00:07:01,140
Happy.

113
00:07:01,947 --> 00:07:02,800
Sad.

114
00:07:04,816 --> 00:07:05,636
Scared.

115
00:07:09,024 --> 00:07:11,126
Just play with anything you want.

116
00:07:15,261 --> 00:07:17,870
I'm gonna talk to your mommy
for a second.

117
00:07:28,904 --> 00:07:30,744
This will take some time.

118
00:07:30,905 --> 00:07:34,103
I can wait outside
if it will make things go faster.

119
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,343
More time than just today.

120
00:07:36,828 --> 00:07:38,233
I'll wait outside.

121
00:08:16,993 --> 00:08:18,209
Where you been?

122
00:08:18,968 --> 00:08:20,029
On a run.

123
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,382
- You've been gone six hours.
- I guess I'm slow.

124
00:08:26,016 --> 00:08:28,342
I doubled back on Sherman's house.

125
00:08:28,462 --> 00:08:30,365
I got nothing. How was he?

126
00:08:30,584 --> 00:08:32,265
Curious, smart, annoying.

127
00:08:32,426 --> 00:08:35,461
- So he's good at his job.
- Better than we were at ours.

128
00:08:35,855 --> 00:08:38,145
We bugged the office,
but we still need the patient files.

129
00:08:38,306 --> 00:08:40,273
- You're going back?
- Not my first choice.

130
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:54,829
I'm fine, okay?
I'm fine.

131
00:08:56,278 --> 00:08:57,980
I was just cleaning it.

132
00:08:58,311 --> 00:09:00,201
I thought...
I thought I cleared it.

133
00:09:02,455 --> 00:09:05,047
It's just a burn
from the shell casing.

134
00:09:17,122 --> 00:09:18,692
<i>You want to be the girl?</i>

135
00:09:18,924 --> 00:09:20,332
<i>Where's her mommy?</i>

136
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:24,203
<i>I don't know.
Where do you think her mommy is?</i>

137
00:09:24,323 --> 00:09:25,656
<i>She's working.</i>

138
00:09:28,785 --> 00:09:31,949
She doesn't like the way
her mommy looks at her.

139
00:09:32,811 --> 00:09:34,368
No?
How does she look at her?

140
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,788
She wants to tell you a secret.

141
00:09:40,855 --> 00:09:43,362
I want my old mommy back.

142
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:15,868
- Your daughter is beautiful.
- Thank you.

143
00:10:20,111 --> 00:10:21,540
She looks just like her mommy.

144
00:10:23,052 --> 00:10:23,786
Yes.

145
00:10:24,787 --> 00:10:25,805
She does.

146
00:10:32,962 --> 00:10:35,312
I just need a minute
with your mom, okay?

147
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:37,390
Wait here.

148
00:10:49,271 --> 00:10:52,321
What are your strongest memories
from childhood?

149
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,255
My strongest memories?

150
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:01,080
Yeah, what do you remember most?
What's vivid to you?

151
00:11:01,557 --> 00:11:02,581
Why do you ask?

152
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:07,211
Well, the death of Savannah's father
is the most vivid memory she has.

153
00:11:07,664 --> 00:11:09,882
Hearing the news, the funeral.

154
00:11:10,374 --> 00:11:12,675
She's so young,
she has no distance from it.

155
00:11:14,689 --> 00:11:17,513
Well, we can't make her
grow faster, can we?

156
00:11:21,456 --> 00:11:24,816
Look, I'm...
I'm sure you're in a lot of pain,

157
00:11:26,065 --> 00:11:27,761
but you need to reassure Savannah

158
00:11:27,881 --> 00:11:31,694
that she hasn't lost her mother
as well as her father.

159
00:11:42,721 --> 00:11:44,893
You know the squirrel and the tree?

160
00:11:48,873 --> 00:11:49,935
See...

161
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:53,678
You make a loop for the tree.

162
00:11:54,682 --> 00:11:57,136
The squirrel runs around the tree.

163
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:00,434
Then he dives in the hole

164
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,476
and scurries out the other side.

165
00:12:12,052 --> 00:12:12,861
John.

166
00:12:15,923 --> 00:12:17,287
- The usual?
- Yeah.

167
00:12:17,561 --> 00:12:18,475
Thanks.

168
00:13:27,388 --> 00:13:29,353
- Jesse?
- Hey, baby.

169
00:13:37,793 --> 00:13:39,381
What are you doing here?

170
00:13:40,034 --> 00:13:43,284
- Connor sent you back. What for?
- Why'd Connor send you back?

171
00:13:44,022 --> 00:13:45,369
You're here.
You must know.

172
00:13:45,813 --> 00:13:47,100
No one told me.

173
00:13:48,511 --> 00:13:50,166
And you left
without saying good-bye.

174
00:13:55,093 --> 00:13:58,208
My orders were to set up a safe house
and wait.

175
00:13:58,328 --> 00:14:00,231
For what, I don't know.

176
00:14:00,813 --> 00:14:01,697
I wait.

177
00:14:02,565 --> 00:14:03,749
At the park.

178
00:14:04,651 --> 00:14:05,764
Eating hot dogs.

179
00:14:06,247 --> 00:14:08,642
What about you?
What's Connor got you doing?

180
00:14:09,062 --> 00:14:11,221
Connor didn't send me back, Derek.

181
00:14:11,341 --> 00:14:13,290
He didn't?
What do you mean?

182
00:14:19,623 --> 00:14:20,623
That's new.

183
00:14:21,665 --> 00:14:22,622
Not to me.

184
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,410
There's metal everywhere these days.

185
00:14:26,715 --> 00:14:28,153
Looking for us.

186
00:14:28,906 --> 00:14:30,412
Working for us.

187
00:14:31,809 --> 00:14:33,667
Connor's got at least one
in every major base.

188
00:14:34,849 --> 00:14:37,710
A big one flipped on us,
took out half a bunker.

189
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:39,599
Bird.

190
00:14:40,571 --> 00:14:41,498
Cullie.

191
00:14:43,936 --> 00:14:46,680
That's from the same shrapnel
that killed Cullie.

192
00:14:47,562 --> 00:14:49,113
How'd you get back here?

193
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,813
Cullie's brother.
He's a bubble tech.

194
00:14:52,173 --> 00:14:54,345
- He's the same one...
- Who sent you back.

195
00:14:55,276 --> 00:14:56,248
I know.

196
00:15:02,497 --> 00:15:03,634
Are you AWOL?

197
00:15:09,121 --> 00:15:12,331
Jesse, did you run
from the war?

198
00:15:18,299 --> 00:15:19,797
I need a place to rest.

199
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:21,238
You're a soldier.

200
00:15:22,659 --> 00:15:23,812
You fight.

201
00:15:25,812 --> 00:15:26,720
Not anymore.

202
00:15:28,935 --> 00:15:30,426
When everything ends,

203
00:15:32,433 --> 00:15:34,141
I wanna be here with you.

204
00:15:40,862 --> 00:15:42,135
Derek, please.

205
00:15:50,457 --> 00:15:52,314
I don't want everything to end.

206
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,588
Jesse, not again.

207
00:16:00,538 --> 00:16:02,561
When I showed you in, you...

208
00:16:02,831 --> 00:16:05,134
you assessed the exits.

209
00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:08,678
You're talking to a VA doc.

210
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:11,223
Every vet does it every day.

211
00:16:13,582 --> 00:16:16,395
Well, I don't know what to tell you.
I'm not a vet.

212
00:16:16,555 --> 00:16:18,004
No, of course not.

213
00:16:18,888 --> 00:16:20,685
Your dad was though, right?

214
00:16:24,047 --> 00:16:26,399
Vets are the ones
who come back, right?

215
00:16:27,729 --> 00:16:29,737
My dad never came back, so...

216
00:16:31,285 --> 00:16:32,858
My mistake.
I'm sorry.

217
00:16:40,723 --> 00:16:41,667
You...

218
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:45,215
You didn't have that yesterday.
What happened?

219
00:16:48,746 --> 00:16:50,757
Oh, it's a burn.

220
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:53,049
Just an accident.
I was cooking.

221
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:54,808
What were you cooking?

222
00:16:56,924 --> 00:16:58,617
What does that matter?

223
00:16:59,641 --> 00:17:00,808
Just curious.

224
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:06,914
I was boiling water
for pasta.

225
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,327
Why do you think
your mother brought you here?

226
00:17:15,207 --> 00:17:17,289
I don't know.
She doesn't tell me everything.

227
00:17:17,784 --> 00:17:19,708
Why do you think you're here?

228
00:17:23,086 --> 00:17:24,546
I couldn't tell you.

229
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:29,501
Do you cook for the family much?

230
00:17:29,753 --> 00:17:32,191
Is that a role you take on?

231
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:34,139
What?

232
00:17:34,685 --> 00:17:37,351
What is your role in the family?
What do you do?

233
00:17:38,994 --> 00:17:39,906
Do?

234
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,867
I go to school.
I hang out.

235
00:17:44,391 --> 00:17:45,530
I'm a kid.

236
00:17:46,367 --> 00:17:47,309
Are you?

237
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,939
You think I'm lying? Why don't you check
my passport or something?

238
00:17:52,059 --> 00:17:53,742
I simply meant

239
00:17:54,368 --> 00:17:56,566
that some children
who've lost a parent

240
00:17:56,686 --> 00:17:58,648
feel pressure

241
00:17:59,637 --> 00:18:01,834
to take the place
of the absent parent.

242
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,060
They...

243
00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:05,402
Well, they grow up quickly.

244
00:18:07,146 --> 00:18:08,435
Interesting,

245
00:18:08,584 --> 00:18:10,690
you say passport

246
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:14,179
when a lot of kids would say
driver's license.

247
00:18:15,684 --> 00:18:16,684
You ever...

248
00:18:17,465 --> 00:18:19,353
feel like running, escaping?

249
00:18:27,131 --> 00:18:28,225
All the time.

250
00:18:30,622 --> 00:18:31,371
Why?

251
00:18:31,683 --> 00:18:34,380
Why do you want to escape?

252
00:18:37,067 --> 00:18:40,138
Look, I want you to know
everything you say

253
00:18:40,775 --> 00:18:42,034
is between us.

254
00:18:44,913 --> 00:18:46,651
This is a safe place.

255
00:18:55,121 --> 00:18:56,378
No, it's not.

256
00:18:58,286 --> 00:18:59,380
Nowhere is.

257
00:19:03,795 --> 00:19:06,690
Did you know that 60% of all teen
suicides are committed with a gun?

258
00:19:06,871 --> 00:19:08,720
He thought it was cleared.
It was an accident.

259
00:19:08,873 --> 00:19:10,986
Some first attempts
may appear to be an accident.

260
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,041
What's taking so long in there?

261
00:19:15,563 --> 00:19:16,909
Can we talk?

262
00:19:20,682 --> 00:19:23,637
I'd like to see John again, alone.

263
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:25,450
John? Why?

264
00:19:25,934 --> 00:19:28,824
Oh, actually, I'd like
to see all of you again.

265
00:19:30,496 --> 00:19:34,752
I think your daughter has some sort
of social disorder.

266
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,720
It's too early to diagnose,
but she...

267
00:19:37,496 --> 00:19:39,973
does exhibit
possible Asperger's symptoms.

268
00:19:40,995 --> 00:19:41,995
And John?

269
00:19:42,994 --> 00:19:46,422
Yeah, this might
sound strange to you,

270
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:50,275
but he reminds me
of veterans I used to treat.

271
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:51,815
War veterans.

272
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,688
Yeah, Vietnam, especially.

273
00:19:53,808 --> 00:19:56,538
The way he evaluates a room.

274
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,118
His guardedness.
The way he carries himself.

275
00:20:01,053 --> 00:20:03,914
Do you know of any violence
in his past?

276
00:20:10,617 --> 00:20:13,173
He's never been abused,
if that's what you're suggesting.

277
00:20:14,689 --> 00:20:17,636
- I'm not suggesting anything like that.
- Thank you, Doctor.

278
00:20:19,234 --> 00:20:21,694
It may not be me,

279
00:20:22,509 --> 00:20:25,275
but that boy needs to talk
to somebody.

280
00:20:26,407 --> 00:20:27,407
We talk.

281
00:20:29,664 --> 00:20:31,044
That's not enough.

282
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:36,211
<i>Strangest thing about her?</i>

283
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,024
<i>For one of the best minds
in the tech world,</i>

284
00:20:41,144 --> 00:20:42,812
<i>she's practically a Luddite.</i>

285
00:20:43,468 --> 00:20:44,547
<i>You liar.</i>

286
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,119
<i>Bicycle or car?</i>

287
00:20:47,777 --> 00:20:50,173
- <i>Bicycle.</i>
- <i>Electric or acoustic?</i>

288
00:20:50,342 --> 00:20:52,242
<i>He thinks he's so smart.</i>

289
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,006
<i>I just know you, that's all.</i>

290
00:20:55,289 --> 00:20:57,476
<i>Tell them how you work from home.</i>

291
00:20:58,529 --> 00:21:00,387
<i>Come on.
Come on, tell them.</i>

292
00:21:01,836 --> 00:21:03,572
<i>My father was a butcher.</i>

293
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:05,684
<i>One of the oldest shops
in Edinburgh.</i>

294
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,137
<i>We didn't have a lot of money
for school supplies.</i>

295
00:21:08,257 --> 00:21:10,269
<i>She writes on butcher's paper.</i>

296
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,191
<i>Like, big rolls of it
with grease pencils.</i>

297
00:21:13,785 --> 00:21:15,538
<i>I like the way it smells.</i>

298
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:21,737
<i>Miss Weaver,
you're needed down in the lab.</i>

299
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,079
It won't run any
of the tests or diagnostics.

300
00:21:26,239 --> 00:21:28,306
It just keeps playing
these twisted pictures

301
00:21:28,426 --> 00:21:29,951
and doing equations.

302
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,756
I don't know,
maybe we should consider,

303
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:39,718
scrapping it and starting over
with a clean platform.

304
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,974
Should I consider
scrapping my team as well?

305
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,934
Or does that seem equally
as intemperate?

306
00:21:54,444 --> 00:21:56,026
<i>Strangest thing about her?</i>

307
00:21:58,132 --> 00:22:00,357
<i>For one of the best minds
in the tech world,</i>

308
00:22:00,477 --> 00:22:02,371
<i>she's practically a Luddite.</i>

309
00:22:06,467 --> 00:22:08,722
Daddy keeps touching your tummy.

310
00:22:09,074 --> 00:22:10,040
Does he?

311
00:22:11,825 --> 00:22:13,643
Is he trying to hug me?

312
00:22:18,981 --> 00:22:22,344
- I don't know.
- I think he's trying to hug me.

313
00:22:47,389 --> 00:22:50,751
- When are we going back to Sherman?
- We're not going back, not now.

314
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:52,733
Patients list was a bust.

315
00:22:52,897 --> 00:22:54,928
He's got the names encoded
for privacy.

316
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:57,254
Tapes have been useless,
but we'll keep listening.

317
00:22:57,526 --> 00:23:00,132
Well, I can push him more,
get something.

318
00:23:00,293 --> 00:23:02,480
- Like what?
- I don't know.

319
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:04,678
He's on that wall
for a reason though.

320
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:06,722
For all we know,
he could have a 888 on his ass.

321
00:23:07,111 --> 00:23:10,350
Or it could be six months from now.
There's no timetable on the list.

322
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,436
So you just wanna give up?

323
00:23:12,915 --> 00:23:16,365
Don't know what Skynet wants from him.
We can't trust him.

324
00:23:17,976 --> 00:23:20,402
Maybe his name's on the list
because he helps John.

325
00:23:22,227 --> 00:23:23,309
Helps John?

326
00:23:24,047 --> 00:23:27,367
- What makes you think John needs help?
- What makes you think I don't?

327
00:23:32,193 --> 00:23:33,206
Do you?

328
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:40,038
Because you can talk to me, John.

329
00:23:40,981 --> 00:23:42,266
You always have.

330
00:23:45,668 --> 00:23:47,419
No, I'm fine.

331
00:24:47,005 --> 00:24:48,727
I had this friend once.

332
00:24:49,725 --> 00:24:51,447
We dug tunnels together.

333
00:24:54,713 --> 00:24:57,050
Roughest son of a bitch I ever knew.

334
00:24:57,802 --> 00:25:00,115
One day, he went out to take a leak.

335
00:25:01,509 --> 00:25:04,871
And when he was out there,
he just decided to blow his head off.

336
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,507
Just like that.

337
00:25:08,671 --> 00:25:11,763
He fought, and fought,
and fought for his life,

338
00:25:14,158 --> 00:25:15,559
then just couldn't anymore.

339
00:25:16,486 --> 00:25:18,197
John is not suicidal.

340
00:25:22,658 --> 00:25:23,915
But what is he?

341
00:25:25,297 --> 00:25:28,071
He's not a boy. He's not a man.
He's not a soldier.

342
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:31,169
He has changed.

343
00:25:32,862 --> 00:25:34,627
Saw his mother kill a man.

344
00:26:03,516 --> 00:26:04,524
I won't scream.

345
00:26:50,426 --> 00:26:52,675
- Getting off?
- I'm going down.

346
00:26:56,739 --> 00:26:59,832
I'm gonna have to ask you
to get off on this floor.

347
00:27:01,827 --> 00:27:02,928
Of course.

348
00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:16,465
We're developing
a human interactive AI.

349
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,184
It's like a child.

350
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:21,959
Its neural network needs to be trained
to recognize images.

351
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:25,458
I guess I'm still a little fuzzy
as to why you called me here.

352
00:27:25,678 --> 00:27:27,880
We were in the process
of training the AI

353
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,310
when it stopped running
all its tests.

354
00:27:31,115 --> 00:27:32,115
Now...

355
00:27:33,678 --> 00:27:35,299
all it plays is this.

356
00:27:52,261 --> 00:27:53,737
Is something funny?

357
00:27:54,216 --> 00:27:55,760
It is if you get the joke.

358
00:27:57,589 --> 00:27:59,273
It's asking a question.

359
00:27:59,465 --> 00:28:01,683
The question mark equals "why."

360
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:05,219
Equations, that's "math".
Books, well, they're books.

361
00:28:05,339 --> 00:28:07,105
And these images here,

362
00:28:07,616 --> 00:28:09,149
they all represent sadness.

363
00:28:09,807 --> 00:28:10,993
All together,

364
00:28:11,113 --> 00:28:14,743
"Why is a math book so sad?"

365
00:28:16,691 --> 00:28:18,575
It's a riddle, a joke.

366
00:28:19,048 --> 00:28:20,994
A third grader told it to me.

367
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:27,208
Around three to four years old,
a child starts asking questions.

368
00:28:27,368 --> 00:28:31,004
But your AI appears to be
even more advanced.

369
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:34,389
It recognizes humor.
That doesn't happen until...

370
00:28:34,772 --> 00:28:37,738
Well, actually some people
never get a sense of humor.

371
00:28:40,609 --> 00:28:42,974
If this were one of my patients,

372
00:28:43,205 --> 00:28:46,334
I would say it was a gifted child
who's grown bored.

373
00:28:46,539 --> 00:28:47,812
It's amusing itself.

374
00:28:48,016 --> 00:28:50,921
But of course, that's impossible.
It's just a machine.

375
00:28:51,221 --> 00:28:53,596
Yes, impossible.

376
00:28:55,772 --> 00:28:58,547
Why is a math book so sad?

377
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,825
Because it has so many problems.

378
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:09,413
<i>Why?</i>

379
00:29:09,533 --> 00:29:12,133
<i>Why do you wanna escape?</i>

380
00:29:14,907 --> 00:29:17,654
<i>Look, I want you to know
everything you say</i>

381
00:29:18,638 --> 00:29:20,196
<i>is between us.</i>

382
00:29:21,782 --> 00:29:23,381
<i>This is a safe place.</i>

383
00:29:25,022 --> 00:29:26,252
<i>No, it's not.</i>

384
00:29:26,747 --> 00:29:27,892
<i>Nowhere is.</i>

385
00:29:28,097 --> 00:29:30,313
<i>Don't you feel safe
around your family?</i>

386
00:29:32,434 --> 00:29:34,274
<i>My family? Safe?</i>

387
00:29:37,158 --> 00:29:39,758
<i>Well, your mother seems
like a strong woman.</i>

388
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:41,616
<i>Doesn't that make you feel safe?</i>

389
00:29:43,814 --> 00:29:46,124
<i>It might, if that's what she wanted.</i>

390
00:29:46,621 --> 00:29:49,404
<i>Safe is the last thing
she wants me to feel.</i>

391
00:29:51,209 --> 00:29:53,081
<i>I find that hard to believe.</i>

392
00:29:54,374 --> 00:29:55,991
<i>I'm sure she's right.</i>

393
00:29:57,686 --> 00:29:59,217
<i>She's always right.</i>

394
00:30:04,172 --> 00:30:05,989
<i>Fear can be a good thing.</i>

395
00:30:08,081 --> 00:30:10,418
<i>On a bad day, it'll keep you alive.</i>

396
00:30:12,823 --> 00:30:14,900
<i>Do you have bad days like that?</i>

397
00:30:33,134 --> 00:30:34,236
I was...

398
00:30:37,234 --> 00:30:40,925
thinking about that time we met.

399
00:30:42,892 --> 00:30:45,078
You found me outside the bunker.

400
00:30:45,907 --> 00:30:49,726
When you went to take a leak
and almost ate your gun?

401
00:30:54,354 --> 00:30:57,609
I don't think I've ever thanked you
for what you said that day.

402
00:30:58,742 --> 00:31:00,983
I think the exact words were,

403
00:31:02,281 --> 00:31:04,086
"Your fly's open."

404
00:31:06,837 --> 00:31:07,848
It was.

405
00:31:45,366 --> 00:31:47,575
Is there a word
for what we just did?

406
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:54,123
- A word?
- For what we just did.

407
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:56,299
I can think of a few, yeah.

408
00:31:57,311 --> 00:31:58,556
Can you?

409
00:31:58,992 --> 00:32:00,925
- You wanna hear 'em?
- No.

410
00:32:03,112 --> 00:32:04,342
I want a new one.

411
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:09,457
Is this your way
of getting rid of me?

412
00:32:09,577 --> 00:32:11,490
You'll be gone soon enough.

413
00:32:16,492 --> 00:32:18,570
What do we need
a new word for?

414
00:32:18,932 --> 00:32:21,568
I'm pretty sure if I use the old ones
you'll still do it with me.

415
00:32:24,768 --> 00:32:26,572
I might choose

416
00:32:27,775 --> 00:32:29,142
to misunderstand.

417
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:31,807
The old words.

418
00:32:33,556 --> 00:32:35,346
I have a new life, Derek.

419
00:32:35,879 --> 00:32:37,314
I want new words.

420
00:32:45,023 --> 00:32:47,511
Think of one
and I might let you stay.

421
00:32:52,501 --> 00:32:53,621
I'm thirsty.

422
00:32:58,775 --> 00:33:00,440
Can you get me a drink, please?

423
00:33:25,181 --> 00:33:27,467
I don't think I've ever seen
anything like it.

424
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:31,008
- It's for my daughter.
- I'm sure she'll love it.

425
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:33,431
You think so?

426
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:37,565
I don't know what she loves.

427
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:41,325
How goes the robot hunt,
Mr. Ellison?

428
00:33:43,129 --> 00:33:44,776
Absurd, when you put it like that.

429
00:33:44,936 --> 00:33:47,667
If you need any resources,
you let me know.

430
00:33:50,742 --> 00:33:53,366
I do have a question,
if that's all right.

431
00:33:54,104 --> 00:33:55,372
The basement.

432
00:33:55,676 --> 00:33:57,372
What's happening down there?

433
00:33:58,628 --> 00:34:00,917
It seems that there's high security.

434
00:34:01,867 --> 00:34:04,087
And for good reason, Mr. Ellison.

435
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:06,337
We're building something.

436
00:34:09,849 --> 00:34:11,530
Good luck on your hunt.

437
00:34:16,204 --> 00:34:19,430
Sorry about the confusion.
My assistant's out today.

438
00:34:20,155 --> 00:34:22,817
The temp agency's sending someone.

439
00:34:23,647 --> 00:34:24,813
You all right?

440
00:34:28,377 --> 00:34:30,809
You said this was
a safe place, right?

441
00:34:31,396 --> 00:34:34,199
- That I could say anything?
- That's right.

442
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:16,998
You have to understand,
my mom doesn't want me coming here.

443
00:35:17,709 --> 00:35:18,830
She worries.

444
00:35:19,513 --> 00:35:20,552
About you?

445
00:35:22,179 --> 00:35:23,207
About everybody.

446
00:35:23,614 --> 00:35:25,650
Well, what about your sister?

447
00:35:26,334 --> 00:35:28,315
Is she worried about her too?

448
00:35:30,544 --> 00:35:31,760
My sister's...

449
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:34,510
stronger than I am.

450
00:36:00,626 --> 00:36:02,288
Someone broke into your house?

451
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,601
She forgot my birthday.

452
00:36:07,228 --> 00:36:08,580
I thought she did.

453
00:36:12,188 --> 00:36:14,580
She sent my sister out for a cake.

454
00:36:18,544 --> 00:36:21,045
We were alone, and a man broke in.

455
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,847
He wanted computer equipment.

456
00:36:34,836 --> 00:36:36,080
He tied us up.

457
00:36:37,819 --> 00:36:38,991
What happened next?

458
00:36:43,942 --> 00:36:45,022
Nothing.

459
00:36:48,836 --> 00:36:50,189
Nothing happened.

460
00:36:54,056 --> 00:36:56,050
The guy got what he wanted
and he let us go.

461
00:36:57,309 --> 00:36:58,389
You know,

462
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,546
John, sometimes...

463
00:37:02,612 --> 00:37:04,267
children feel like they need t...

464
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:07,246
to protect their parents.

465
00:37:07,615 --> 00:37:09,269
But that's not your job.

466
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,779
You're not one of my vets.

467
00:37:18,728 --> 00:37:20,300
You're not a soldier.

468
00:37:21,379 --> 00:37:22,924
You get to be a kid.

469
00:39:09,106 --> 00:39:10,518
It was here for Dr. Sherman.

470
00:39:10,992 --> 00:39:13,145
- It was there to kill him.
- Or to protect him.

471
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:15,982
Whatever Sherman is supposed to do,
he's gonna live to do it.

472
00:39:16,773 --> 00:39:17,900
For now.

473
00:39:19,685 --> 00:39:21,670
I guess we're not gonna get
any answers from this.

474
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:24,012
- What'd you do to it?
- Nothing.

475
00:39:24,914 --> 00:39:27,451
Once I accessed the CPU,
the chip destroyed itself.

476
00:39:28,263 --> 00:39:31,122
- This model's been redesigned.
- With a self-destruct feature?

477
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:39,850
Skynet must not want me
reprogramming in the future.

478
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:42,967
- This is one way to stop you.
- I guess they're getting smarter.

479
00:39:43,669 --> 00:39:44,833
We should too.

480
00:39:50,886 --> 00:39:52,523
Time's up, Savannah.

481
00:39:53,781 --> 00:39:55,230
See you next week.

482
00:39:55,544 --> 00:39:59,345
Could you play for a minute, Savannah?
I'd like to speak with the Doctor.

483
00:40:01,517 --> 00:40:03,279
I'm very impressed with your work.

484
00:40:03,964 --> 00:40:06,824
You've done some good work too.

485
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:14,165
Savannah seems happier.

486
00:40:14,975 --> 00:40:17,835
I gather you've worked hard
to show her the mother she knew

487
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,129
before her father's death.

488
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:21,791
I have, yes.

489
00:40:22,515 --> 00:40:24,746
But I wasn't speaking
of your work with Savannah.

490
00:40:24,866 --> 00:40:27,667
I meant the insight
you had into my project.

491
00:40:28,364 --> 00:40:30,723
I could use someone
with your instincts on my team.

492
00:40:32,971 --> 00:40:34,283
I'm flattered,

493
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:38,022
but I do have a responsibility
to my patients.

494
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,825
As a consultant then.

495
00:40:42,539 --> 00:40:44,685
You compared the AI to a child.

496
00:40:45,669 --> 00:40:47,063
Help me raise it.

497
00:40:48,401 --> 00:40:50,044
You realize you're talking to a man

498
00:40:50,164 --> 00:40:52,751
who doesn't even know how
to run his own lawnmower?

499
00:40:52,871 --> 00:40:55,468
Just treat it
like one of your patients.

500
00:40:55,618 --> 00:40:57,245
You'll do quite well.

501
00:41:01,946 --> 00:41:05,525
When I was a child,
I did my sums on rolls of butcher paper.

502
00:41:06,824 --> 00:41:09,531
My father would bring them
home from work.

503
00:41:11,102 --> 00:41:13,371
I liked the way the paper smelled.

504
00:41:14,137 --> 00:41:16,477
That's my most vivid memory
from childhood.

505
00:41:16,637 --> 00:41:19,573
- What did the paper smell like?
- Cow's blood.

506
00:41:29,796 --> 00:41:30,879
<i>In 1678,</i>

507
00:41:30,999 --> 00:41:35,386
<i>doctors diagnosed the mental affliction
soldiers suffered from as "nostalgia".</i>

508
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:45,185
<i>Homesickness.
A longing to return to the past.</i>

509
00:41:47,676 --> 00:41:51,102
<i>The cruel reality of war
is that there is no return home.</i>

510
00:41:52,264 --> 00:41:53,764
<i>No return to innocence.</i>

511
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,362
<i>What is lost is lost forever.</i>

512
00:42:03,915 --> 00:42:05,199
<i>Like my father,</i>

513
00:42:05,568 --> 00:42:07,577
<i>war's wounds have bled me dry.</i>

514
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:12,785
<i>No words of comfort.</i>

515
00:42:18,757 --> 00:42:20,493
<i>No words of forgiveness.</i>

516
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,805
<i>No words at all.</i>

517
00:42:33,053 --> 00:42:35,992
I have to say, I was surprised
when you called.

518
00:42:37,687 --> 00:42:40,790
Why don't you start
by telling me why you're here.
