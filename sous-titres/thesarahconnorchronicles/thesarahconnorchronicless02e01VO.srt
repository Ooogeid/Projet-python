<i>Previously on</i> Terminator:
The Sarah Connor Chronicles...

17
00:00:47,502 --> 00:00:49,219
Do we have a John Reese?

18
00:00:56,207 --> 00:00:57,435
Come if you want to live.

19
00:00:57,595 --> 00:00:59,604
You want to stop Skynet?
This is the way.

20
00:01:01,283 --> 00:01:03,316
Cromartie came through.
He knows we're here.

21
00:01:03,999 --> 00:01:05,652
We're programmed
to repair ourselves'.

22
00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:07,862
We're programmed to blend in.

23
00:01:08,982 --> 00:01:11,074
- There are other people here?
- Resistance fighters.

24
00:01:11,194 --> 00:01:13,397
Humans sent back from the future
by John.

25
00:01:13,517 --> 00:01:14,703
The machine's gotta go.

26
00:01:15,212 --> 00:01:17,557
Don't let yourself think
that you can train them like a pet,

27
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:19,758
because it'll be the last thing
that you think.

28
00:01:19,878 --> 00:01:21,209
Your fiancee, Sarah Connor,

29
00:01:21,369 --> 00:01:23,283
killed a man because she believes
in the future,

30
00:01:23,403 --> 00:01:26,631
he'll invent a computer system
that declares war on the world.

31
00:01:26,751 --> 00:01:29,859
My Turk plays chess
at a level that could defeat

32
00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:32,721
every human player that has ever lived
and probably ever will live.

33
00:01:32,881 --> 00:01:35,014
Tech Industry spent billions
doubling chip power.

34
00:01:35,174 --> 00:01:38,334
That's how we can go
from a chess computer to the apocalypse.

35
00:01:38,454 --> 00:01:39,686
The Turk created Skynet.

36
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:42,076
Somebody killed him
and took the machine.

37
00:01:42,196 --> 00:01:43,690
He was dead and the Turk was gone.

38
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:46,182
Got a good idea who has it.
Sarkissian.

39
00:01:46,302 --> 00:01:48,126
Check the office.
See if he stashed the Turk.

40
00:01:48,246 --> 00:01:49,529
Sarkissian's hard drive.

41
00:01:49,854 --> 00:01:52,365
If you die, they win.

42
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:25,969
Agent Ellison.

43
00:08:26,651 --> 00:08:28,050
Can I borrow you?

44
00:08:31,423 --> 00:08:34,809
Pulled him from the apartment.
It's your guy, right? The shooter?

45
00:08:36,067 --> 00:08:37,570
Yeah, that's him.

46
00:08:37,972 --> 00:08:40,976
How does a mope like that
take out 20 of our HRT?

47
00:08:43,185 --> 00:08:45,903
Zach wants you back home
for a full incident report.

48
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,238
You need a ride?

49
00:08:47,805 --> 00:08:49,615
I can get a junior agent
to drive your car.

50
00:08:49,775 --> 00:08:50,575
Come on.

51
00:08:54,114 --> 00:08:57,248
They gonna believe a mope like this
took out 20 of your HRT?

52
00:08:57,408 --> 00:09:00,543
And believe a machine from the future
stole his identity and did it?

53
00:09:02,362 --> 00:09:03,546
They gotta believe.

54
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,737
This has to end here.

55
00:09:07,836 --> 00:09:09,719
Sorry you gotta take the blame for it.

56
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:11,382
It's not your fault.

57
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:14,582
Just bad luck.

58
00:09:19,221 --> 00:09:20,396
You all right?

59
00:09:22,016 --> 00:09:23,292
John, are you all right?

60
00:09:24,435 --> 00:09:25,693
Would you answer me?

61
00:09:26,729 --> 00:09:27,530
Mom!

62
00:09:34,855 --> 00:09:37,205
Can you move?
Are you hurt? You're bleeding.

63
00:09:37,365 --> 00:09:39,498
- I'm fine. Are you all right?
- Just my shoulder.

64
00:09:41,341 --> 00:09:42,627
We gotta go.

65
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:48,049
- Can you walk?
- Yeah.

66
00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:50,009
Good, 'cause we gotta run.

67
00:09:51,128 --> 00:09:52,428
Come back here!

68
00:10:13,849 --> 00:10:16,494
<i>All fire and EMT Personnel
advised to stand by.</i>

69
00:10:16,738 --> 00:10:19,770
<i>Fire has destroyed a home

70
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,874
<i>Number of dead or injured

71
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,705
- These the only two DOA?
- That's it.

72
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:06,711
- You check the whole house?
- House is clear.

73
00:11:33,272 --> 00:11:35,948
What the hell's going on here?
Where is she?

74
00:11:36,345 --> 00:11:37,668
Hell if I know.

75
00:11:38,295 --> 00:11:39,493
Long gone if I know her.

76
00:11:40,391 --> 00:11:43,270
- Who's out there under those sheets?
- We were doing a deal.

77
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,397
Went bad.

78
00:11:45,551 --> 00:11:46,667
We stole this.

79
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,003
Guess they came back for it.

80
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:53,012
- What's on it?
- Records, names, transactions.

81
00:11:53,265 --> 00:11:54,472
I don't know.

82
00:11:54,843 --> 00:11:56,969
We thought we could use it.


83
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,261
- What are you looking for?
- It's a piece of tech.

84
00:11:59,381 --> 00:12:00,976
It's called the Turk.

85
00:12:03,446 --> 00:12:05,144
It's another computer.
It's a program.

86
00:12:05,304 --> 00:12:06,961
- What's it do?
- Right now?

87
00:12:07,081 --> 00:12:08,865
Plays a mean game of chess.

88
00:12:08,985 --> 00:12:12,735
Couple years, it's gonna get
really pissed off. Blow up the world.

89
00:12:13,796 --> 00:12:16,322
<i>Units requested.
Possible stolen vehicle</i>

90
00:12:16,482 --> 00:12:20,185
<i>involved in an accident.
Suspects fled scene. Injuries unknown.</i>

91
00:12:21,487 --> 00:12:24,356
- She could be anywhere.
- That's right, she could be anywhere.

92
00:12:24,476 --> 00:12:26,110
Or she could be right there.

93
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,331
Maybe with your chess program.

94
00:12:32,869 --> 00:12:35,800
The identification of these two victims
has not yet been released.

95
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,128
<i>And it is unclear
how they are connected to this blaze</i>

96
00:12:38,248 --> 00:12:39,678
<i>or to the car explosion nearby.</i>

97
00:12:40,198 --> 00:12:41,138
Mr. Walsh?

98
00:12:41,849 --> 00:12:43,641
- Ma'am.
- Do you have it?

99
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:46,102
I do, Ma'am.
It's a modest little mouse,

100
00:12:46,262 --> 00:12:49,397
if I may say.
It's not much to look at for 300,000.

101
00:12:49,557 --> 00:12:51,552
Better be able to checkmate
Bobby Fischer for that.

102
00:12:51,744 --> 00:12:53,734
Not for you to judge, Mr. Walsh.

103
00:12:53,894 --> 00:12:56,362
- It's the last you'll hear of it.
- When will I see you?

104
00:12:56,522 --> 00:12:59,156
I thought I'd tour the sights
with it for a bit, Ma'am.

105
00:12:59,316 --> 00:13:01,909
- <i>Make sure I was clean.</i>
- That seems prudent.

106
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:03,038
An hour, then.

107
00:13:03,886 --> 00:13:04,954
An hour.

108
00:13:05,395 --> 00:13:06,604
And Mr. Walsh,

109
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:10,056
Bobby Fischer's dead.

110
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,451
<i>Yes?</i>

111
00:13:19,571 --> 00:13:21,756
Call a meeting of the department heads
for tonight.

112
00:13:21,876 --> 00:13:22,781
<i>Tonight?</i>

113
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,725
<i>But Ms. Weaver, Justin Tuck
is in Palm Springs for a long weekend.</i>

114
00:13:28,173 --> 00:13:30,355
- <i>I'll get him back.</i>
- Thank you.

115
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,876
Witness saw a woman
and a teenage boy get out of the car

116
00:14:14,996 --> 00:14:16,835
and move off to the south.

117
00:14:16,955 --> 00:14:19,445
- Are they hurt?
- Either way, they're moving.

118
00:14:32,763 --> 00:14:34,084
I'm okay.

119
00:14:34,244 --> 00:14:36,170
It's just bruised. Let's go.

120
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:38,020
It could be broken.

121
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,592
How's your leg?
Is your head still bleeding?

122
00:14:41,752 --> 00:14:43,678
We've gotta get off the street.

123
00:14:43,798 --> 00:14:45,846
We need to find a safe place.

124
00:15:23,731 --> 00:15:25,534
Has there been an accident?

125
00:15:39,613 --> 00:15:41,012
We need sanctuary.

126
00:15:43,347 --> 00:15:45,249
Can I ask for that? Please?

127
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:48,966
We need somewhere to hide.
Now.

128
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:53,639
Yes.

129
00:15:55,271 --> 00:15:56,875
Of course. Come with me.

130
00:15:58,588 --> 00:15:59,722
And they should leave.

131
00:16:10,392 --> 00:16:11,403
Come on.

132
00:16:14,435 --> 00:16:16,936
- What will you do when you find 'em?
- Do?

133
00:16:17,653 --> 00:16:18,851
Join the team?

134
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:23,174
Think she's gonna go with you,
'cause it's not gonna happen.

135
00:16:23,294 --> 00:16:25,267
She left you at the altar
for a reason.

136
00:16:25,387 --> 00:16:27,796
- That's not what I want.
- Really.

137
00:16:28,233 --> 00:16:30,242
- Yeah. I'm married.
- So you say.

138
00:16:30,402 --> 00:16:32,504
- I love my wife.
- So you say.

139
00:16:33,754 --> 00:16:35,873
Look, I just wanna know they're okay,
got it?

140
00:16:36,033 --> 00:16:38,722
- What if they're not?
- Then I'll make 'em okay.

141
00:16:38,842 --> 00:16:40,343
Like I did for you.

142
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:16,664
Your money'll be deposited
in the account within 30 minutes.

143
00:17:16,996 --> 00:17:19,902
Please,
take all the precautions we discussed.

144
00:17:20,518 --> 00:17:21,822
Of course, Ma'am.

145
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,866
So much for so little.
Again, don't mind me sayin'.

146
00:17:30,477 --> 00:17:33,072
They flow from street to street.

147
00:17:34,957 --> 00:17:38,143
At a particular speed
and in a particular direction.

148
00:17:38,644 --> 00:17:40,062
Walk the block,

149
00:17:40,417 --> 00:17:43,012
wait for the signal,
cross at the light.

150
00:17:43,411 --> 00:17:44,708
Over and over.

151
00:17:45,888 --> 00:17:47,297
So orderly.

152
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:50,789
All day I can watch them and know
with a great deal of certainty

153
00:17:50,909 --> 00:17:53,784
what they'll do at any given moment.

154
00:17:54,624 --> 00:17:57,747
But they're not orderly, are they?
Up close.

155
00:17:59,417 --> 00:18:00,573
Any individual.

156
00:18:02,029 --> 00:18:03,961
Who knows what they're gonna do?

157
00:18:05,696 --> 00:18:07,580
Any one of them
might dash across the street

158
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,925
at the wrong time
and get hit by a car.

159
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,294
When you get up close,

160
00:18:14,145 --> 00:18:16,098
we never follow the rules.

161
00:18:17,226 --> 00:18:21,028
You give a computer a series of rules,
and it will follow them

162
00:18:21,784 --> 00:18:24,564
till those rules
are superseded by other rules.

163
00:18:24,858 --> 00:18:26,901
Or that computer simply...

164
00:18:27,312 --> 00:18:29,361
wears down and quits.

165
00:18:29,758 --> 00:18:32,434
Computers are obedient to a fault.

166
00:18:33,174 --> 00:18:35,617
Do you know what's extremely rare
in the world of computers?

167
00:18:36,397 --> 00:18:37,369
Finding one...

168
00:18:38,966 --> 00:18:40,945
that'll cross against the light.

169
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,252
Thank you, Mr. Walsh.

170
00:18:48,342 --> 00:18:49,758
Be careful out there.

171
00:19:05,015 --> 00:19:06,401
Are you all right?

172
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,654
- You already asked me that.
- I'm asking you again.

173
00:19:12,814 --> 00:19:13,818
I'm fine.

174
00:19:15,025 --> 00:19:17,493
I think we need to talk
about what happened back at the house.

175
00:19:17,653 --> 00:19:20,078
- No, I don't.
- Maybe I need to talk about it.

176
00:19:20,238 --> 00:19:23,025
Maybe you do, but I don't,
so let's not.

177
00:19:23,461 --> 00:19:24,249
Please.

178
00:19:27,281 --> 00:19:29,307
Then we need to talk about her.

179
00:19:30,042 --> 00:19:33,884
Whatever happened with the explosion,
it's flipped a switch.

180
00:19:34,336 --> 00:19:36,125
She's reverted or something.

181
00:19:36,855 --> 00:19:38,972
She knows everything.

182
00:19:39,133 --> 00:19:39,952
I know.

183
00:19:40,384 --> 00:19:43,811
Bank accounts.
Contingency plans. Weapons stash.

184
00:19:43,971 --> 00:19:46,141
- I know.
- How we run, where we'll go.

185
00:19:46,261 --> 00:19:47,898
Who we've been, who we'll be.

186
00:19:48,058 --> 00:19:51,010
She's... stronger and faster.

187
00:19:51,228 --> 00:19:53,195
- We have to kill her, John.
- I know!

188
00:20:04,463 --> 00:20:05,463
I know.

189
00:20:13,549 --> 00:20:15,509
I just read your incident report.

190
00:20:15,804 --> 00:20:18,143
I wanna thank you
for filling everything out

191
00:20:18,263 --> 00:20:20,180
so quickly...
It's a big help.

192
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,515
Of course.

193
00:20:21,675 --> 00:20:23,016
So, Laszlo...

194
00:20:23,176 --> 00:20:25,744
Did you ever think
that he had it in him?

195
00:20:26,054 --> 00:20:28,188
Out-of-work actor, a civilian?

196
00:20:28,348 --> 00:20:29,587
I did not, no.

197
00:20:29,837 --> 00:20:32,734
But he was here before.
Suspect in multiple murders.

198
00:20:32,894 --> 00:20:35,529
- We cleared him.
- But you had a change of heart?

199
00:20:35,689 --> 00:20:38,485
I discovered he was impersonating
an FBI agent.

200
00:20:39,348 --> 00:20:42,020
Yeah, I had a change of heart.

201
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,128
Do you have any idea whose bullet

202
00:20:44,248 --> 00:20:46,748
was ultimately responsible
for taking Laszlo out?

203
00:20:46,908 --> 00:20:48,000
No, I don't.

204
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,042
You know who threw the tear gas
into the residence?

205
00:20:52,165 --> 00:20:54,882
And who fired into the apartment,
igniting the canisters?

206
00:20:55,401 --> 00:20:57,843
- No, I do not.
- It's amazing you survived.

207
00:21:02,049 --> 00:21:03,889
Do you know how you survived?

208
00:21:12,517 --> 00:21:14,693
You wanna talk to somebody?
You need help?

209
00:21:15,002 --> 00:21:18,280
You want a counselor? A pastor?
You're divorced. You have anybody?

210
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,531
I'll be all right.

211
00:21:20,085 --> 00:21:23,076
Take six weeks paid leave,
special circumstances.

212
00:21:23,237 --> 00:21:25,996
- I don't think that will be necessary.
- We insist on it.

213
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:34,103
So under possible penalty of perjury,
as it relates to case file

214
00:21:34,372 --> 00:21:35,975
B1987004,

215
00:21:36,095 --> 00:21:38,178
do you, Agent James Ellison,
today attest

216
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:40,174
that all that you've recorded
and said,

217
00:21:40,294 --> 00:21:43,513
case file's accurate and factual
as far as your recollection can warrant?

218
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,413
Yes.

219
00:21:47,277 --> 00:21:48,101
I do.

220
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:54,098
Good luck, Agent.

221
00:22:27,016 --> 00:22:28,725
Yes? May I help you?

222
00:22:30,817 --> 00:22:32,270
I'm looking for my family.

223
00:22:32,556 --> 00:22:35,065
- Family?
- My mother and my brother.

224
00:22:36,074 --> 00:22:38,360
We were in an accident.
I think they're hurt.

225
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,961
There is no one here.

226
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,323
I need to find them.

227
00:22:43,657 --> 00:22:44,908
It's life or death.

228
00:22:45,681 --> 00:22:48,256
Like I said,
there is no one here.

229
00:22:48,572 --> 00:22:50,345
I'm going to look around.

230
00:22:52,847 --> 00:22:54,344
It's life or death.

231
00:23:24,399 --> 00:23:25,282
Now.

232
00:23:28,441 --> 00:23:30,432
- Two minutes.
- I know.

233
00:23:34,302 --> 00:23:36,989
- What are you doing?
- Stay away. Please.

234
00:23:37,741 --> 00:23:40,380
I told you to go away.
You have to stay away.

235
00:23:41,499 --> 00:23:42,558
Go!

236
00:23:44,669 --> 00:23:45,787
70 seconds.

237
00:23:46,302 --> 00:23:49,014
- The knife isn't sharp enough.
- Well, push harder.

238
00:23:50,133 --> 00:23:51,725
- How much time?
- 55.

239
00:23:54,012 --> 00:23:56,021
Wait, I see it.
Screwdriver, screwdriver.

240
00:23:59,893 --> 00:24:02,115
- 35.
- Oh, it's not the right size.

241
00:24:02,562 --> 00:24:03,695
20 seconds.

242
00:24:03,855 --> 00:24:06,027
Okay, okay.
The knife, the knife.

243
00:24:10,638 --> 00:24:12,621
- Damn it!
- We can't do this.

244
00:24:12,781 --> 00:24:14,289
- Come on.
- She's waking up.

245
00:24:14,449 --> 00:24:15,723
She's waking up!

246
00:24:40,788 --> 00:24:41,650
Keys.

247
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,249
You have to go.
Do it.

248
00:26:24,318 --> 00:26:25,641
- What?
- Go.

249
00:26:29,167 --> 00:26:30,165
Move!

250
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:03,625
Call to him.

251
00:27:06,648 --> 00:27:07,629
Call to him.

252
00:27:23,012 --> 00:27:25,480
- You're making this difficult.
- He won't come back!

253
00:27:27,739 --> 00:27:29,567
No. He won't.

254
00:30:09,854 --> 00:30:12,605
You can't do this.
You don't know what you're about to do.

255
00:30:12,765 --> 00:30:14,899
Yes, I do.
You're gonna kill me.

256
00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:17,442
No, John.
You can't do this.

257
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:21,483
You're not doing the right thing.
This is not the right thing, John.

258
00:30:21,789 --> 00:30:23,911
Things are good now.
Things are fine now.

259
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:25,228
I ran a test.

260
00:30:25,778 --> 00:30:28,068
Things are good now.
I'm fixed now.

261
00:30:28,382 --> 00:30:29,914
You can trust me now. 

262
00:30:30,226 --> 00:30:32,625
- What are you waiting for?
- She doesn't know, she doesn't.

263
00:30:33,092 --> 00:30:34,088
I'm good now.

264
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:36,796
I'm good, I ran a test.
Everything's perfect. I'm perfect.

265
00:30:37,832 --> 00:30:39,336
I'm sorry for what I did.

266
00:30:39,456 --> 00:30:41,876
It wasn't me.
You have to understand. It wasn't me.

267
00:30:41,996 --> 00:30:43,927
That wasn't me.
You can't let this happen, John.

268
00:30:44,047 --> 00:30:46,222
You can't!
Please, listen to me.

269
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:48,933
Listen to me. I don't wanna go.
Please, John, please.

270
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:52,061
John, listen to me.
I don't wanna go.

271
00:30:52,547 --> 00:30:53,842
Please, John.

272
00:30:54,092 --> 00:30:56,065
Please. I'm good now.

273
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,009
Listen to me.
I don't want to go. I'm sorry.

274
00:30:59,129 --> 00:31:02,136
That wasn't me.
I'm fixed now. I ran a test.

275
00:31:02,414 --> 00:31:04,949
Everything's perfect.
You can trust me.

276
00:31:06,152 --> 00:31:08,161
I love you!
I love you, please.

277
00:31:08,552 --> 00:31:10,872
I love you, John,
and you love me.

278
00:31:35,381 --> 00:31:37,055
We should get going soon.

279
00:31:37,175 --> 00:31:40,068
You guys cut a pretty serious path
of destruction across the city.

280
00:31:40,378 --> 00:31:41,659
Wasn't us.

281
00:31:44,273 --> 00:31:45,970
- I'm sorry.
- Shoulda called earlier...

282
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:48,785
- We could've helped you avoid some.
- I doubt it.

283
00:31:51,322 --> 00:31:52,410
How's this?

284
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:53,886
It looks trashed.

285
00:31:54,671 --> 00:31:58,169
So I'm guessing Sarkissian
didn't tell you where he sold the Turk.

286
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,713
Wasn't that kind of conversation.

287
00:32:05,628 --> 00:32:07,013
Did he see it all?

288
00:32:07,654 --> 00:32:08,846
He saw it all.

289
00:32:10,911 --> 00:32:12,025
Damn.

290
00:32:25,921 --> 00:32:29,534
So Charlie told me that Cromartie
killed about 20 FBI guys today.

291
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:32,235
He's still out there.

292
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:36,916
He's here for me.
They're dead because of me.

293
00:32:37,076 --> 00:32:41,028
They're dead because some people refuse
to accept the reality of the situation.

294
00:32:41,247 --> 00:32:42,462
Which is what?

295
00:32:42,832 --> 00:32:44,870
Which is that they carry death

296
00:32:45,385 --> 00:32:46,259
with them.

297
00:32:46,986 --> 00:32:48,365
She was different.

298
00:32:49,339 --> 00:32:50,886
- No.
- I made her.

299
00:32:52,083 --> 00:32:53,366
I sent her back.

300
00:32:53,486 --> 00:32:55,207
- She's different.
- She's not different.

301
00:32:55,327 --> 00:32:57,613
There's physical damage
to her chip.

302
00:32:58,082 --> 00:33:00,189
Which means that she can be repaired...

303
00:33:02,737 --> 00:33:03,985
I need her.

304
00:33:06,355 --> 00:33:07,757
She saved my life.

305
00:33:10,699 --> 00:33:12,201
She saves my life!

306
00:33:33,698 --> 00:33:35,494
I know what you saw today.

307
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,408
I know what you did, and I'm...

308
00:33:41,488 --> 00:33:42,790
so proud of you.

309
00:33:45,435 --> 00:33:47,175
Maybe you could fix her.

310
00:33:48,832 --> 00:33:50,198
I know you wanna try.

311
00:33:53,611 --> 00:33:55,995
But I can't let you.
I just... I can't.

312
00:34:04,103 --> 00:34:05,245
So burn her.

313
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,925
Let's get the hell outta here.

314
00:34:32,574 --> 00:34:34,481
What she said back there...

315
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:38,746
Everything she said, it was a trick.
You know that, right?

316
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:44,043
They don't feel anything.

317
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:47,101
They don't have feelings.

318
00:34:51,944 --> 00:34:53,531
They don't know love.

319
00:34:56,593 --> 00:34:57,971
I know that, Mom.

320
00:35:06,227 --> 00:35:09,095
You know,
I saw her do this with the last one.

321
00:35:09,652 --> 00:35:11,350
The only way to be sure.

322
00:35:12,148 --> 00:35:13,661
Especially this one.

323
00:35:15,527 --> 00:35:16,961
John, chip.

324
00:35:58,892 --> 00:36:00,328
The flare. Where is it?

325
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,848
I'm sorry.

326
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,999
John.
Don't do this.

327
00:36:27,181 --> 00:36:28,740
- Don't do this!
- Back off!

328
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:31,400
- John, she'll kill you.
- There's only one way to find out.

329
00:36:49,286 --> 00:36:50,753
Are you here to kill me, John?

330
00:36:53,148 --> 00:36:54,846
Are you here to kill me?

331
00:36:58,438 --> 00:36:59,495
No.

332
00:37:11,259 --> 00:37:12,191
Promise.

333
00:37:45,308 --> 00:37:46,479
Promise.

334
00:38:53,886 --> 00:38:55,378
I'll never lead you to her.

335
00:38:56,155 --> 00:38:59,006
So if that's why you left me alive,
you might as well kill me right now.

336
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,426
I'll never do the Devil's work.

337
00:39:04,002 --> 00:39:05,213
We'll see.

338
00:39:15,835 --> 00:39:17,937
Thank you for joining me tonight.

339
00:39:18,104 --> 00:39:20,403
I'm pleased to announce
the formation of a new division.

340
00:39:20,638 --> 00:39:22,029
It'll cross disciplines,

341
00:39:22,311 --> 00:39:24,307
draw from many areas
of expertise,

342
00:39:24,427 --> 00:39:26,867
and require the highest level of work
from each of your groups.

343
00:39:27,027 --> 00:39:29,495
Each of our groups?
How's that? Won't you be hiring...

344
00:39:29,655 --> 00:39:31,580
I'll be taking team members
from each division

345
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:34,375
- and creating a new team.
- With all due respect,

346
00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:36,954
and I can only speak
on behalf of the AI division

347
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:39,588
when I tell you
that I haven't a man to spare.

348
00:39:39,882 --> 00:39:41,507
Your division will be hard-hit.

349
00:39:42,054 --> 00:39:45,803
A list of new team members
will be on your desks after you leave.

350
00:39:46,149 --> 00:39:48,585
The name of the new group is Babylon.

351
00:39:49,338 --> 00:39:52,714
- It's from the Bible.
- And what does Babylon do?

352
00:39:53,103 --> 00:39:55,563
I mean,
besides steal our team members.

353
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,030
Mr. Tuck,

354
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,591
it's going to change the world.

355
00:40:09,049 --> 00:40:10,488
I got what I could.

356
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:13,247
Some smoke and water damage,
but you don't have to start over.

357
00:40:13,735 --> 00:40:15,691
It wouldn't be the first time.

358
00:40:18,956 --> 00:40:19,986
Thanks.

359
00:40:20,556 --> 00:40:22,143
There's one too many.

360
00:40:22,583 --> 00:40:25,003
Charley took off.
He said to say bye.

361
00:40:25,419 --> 00:40:27,428
Guess he really does have a wife.

362
00:40:37,825 --> 00:40:39,300
Have you seen John?

363
00:40:40,379 --> 00:40:41,984
I think he's using the shower.

364
00:40:44,771 --> 00:40:47,054
Do you believe in the Resurrection?

365
00:40:49,198 --> 00:40:50,034
What?

366
00:40:50,395 --> 00:40:52,205
The story of Jesus Christ.

367
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:55,368
The Resurrection.
Do you believe in it?

368
00:40:55,688 --> 00:40:57,541
Would you if you'd seen
what I've seen?

369
00:40:57,818 --> 00:40:59,543
Faith isn't part of my programming.

370
00:40:59,703 --> 00:41:02,523
Yeah, well, I'm not sure
it's part of mine either.

371
00:41:05,418 --> 00:41:07,283
Don't let him do that again.

372
00:41:08,495 --> 00:41:10,291
If I ever go bad again...

373
00:41:11,515 --> 00:41:13,408
don't let him bring me back.

374
00:41:22,999 --> 00:41:26,048
I made you a sandwich
and brought you some clothes.

375
00:41:26,438 --> 00:41:27,830
I'll be out soon.

376
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:40,443
John, I need you to know
everything that happened today.

377
00:41:40,882 --> 00:41:42,239
Everything we did.

378
00:41:44,774 --> 00:41:45,985
It was all...

379
00:41:48,491 --> 00:41:50,607
It just happened the way it did.

380
00:41:51,568 --> 00:41:54,241
And there's nothing we can do
to change it.

381
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,683
Whatever happened, we're alive.

382
00:41:58,803 --> 00:42:00,194
Okay? We're alive.

383
00:42:03,536 --> 00:42:06,195
I know you need more
from me today, but...

384
00:42:07,646 --> 00:42:09,633
It's gonna have to be enough.

385
00:42:14,007 --> 00:42:15,355
Can you hear me?

386
00:42:17,095 --> 00:42:18,446
Are you listening?

387
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:21,480
Yeah, I'm listening.

388
00:42:26,797 --> 00:42:28,092
Happy birthday.

389
00:42:36,069 --> 00:42:37,982
That was something, wasn't it?

390
00:42:38,102 --> 00:42:40,014
Wonder what she's got planned.

391
00:42:40,134 --> 00:42:42,366
Who knows what goes on
in that brain of hers?

392
00:42:42,486 --> 00:42:45,536
I don't know understand what the hell
she's talking about anyway.

393
00:42:45,656 --> 00:42:48,044
Zen koans and Bible quotes.

394
00:42:48,817 --> 00:42:50,263
It's all a bunch of bull.

395
00:42:50,458 --> 00:42:52,511
Our options have tripled
since she took over,

396
00:42:52,631 --> 00:42:54,946
so I wouldn't bite the hand
if I were you.

397
00:42:55,066 --> 00:42:56,806
Well, that's easy for you to say.

398
00:42:56,926 --> 00:43:00,610
She's not cannibalizing your division
for some top secret Torah study.

399
00:43:07,999 --> 00:43:10,072
God, that bitch pisses me off.

400
00:43:28,977 --> 00:43:31,227
Sorry I piss you off, Mr. Tuck.

401
00:43:44,387 --> 00:43:46,005
The feeling's mutual.
