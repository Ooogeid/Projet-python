1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,380
Onicles...

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:04,650
What does this mean to you?

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,090
I keep seeing it in my dreams,john.

4
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:07,400
It means something.

5
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,300
Weirdo.Kook.Nut.

6
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,600
I've been reading the dictionary.

7
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,620
I don't sleep.

8
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,330
Whatever happened with the explosion flipped a switch.

9
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:18,410
You don't know what you're about to do.

10
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,500
I love you,john,and you love me.

11
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,330
Your name is?

12
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:22,070
Riley.

13
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:22,930
What's the matter?

14
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:24,240
Never brought a girl home before?

15
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:24,820
No.

16
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,510
Riley climbed out john's window.

17
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:27,990
Now is not the time for this.

18
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,190
Well,when is the time?

19
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:32,390
You bring danger into riley's life.

20
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,980
And i'm gonna keep seeing riley even if everyone thinks it's a bad idea.

21
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,860
I understand that it's a bad idea.

22
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,700
So don't worry about it and be happy you're a machine.

23
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,750
I'm a machine.

24
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,650
I can't be happy.

25
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,890
Anything yet?

26
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,940
I've dumped about 50,000 websites.

27
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,380
There are hundreds of companies with three dots in the logo.

28
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,380
Organic fruit.

29
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,300
Candles.

30
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,990
Dog collars.

31
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,340
Baby wipes.

32
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,630
Ice cream.

33
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:08,850
Nothing screams skynet like baby wipes and ice cream.

34
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,530
Keep looking.

35
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,660
It is something you saw in a dream.

36
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,340
And written in blood on the wall.

37
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,860
So it means something.Will you just keep looking?

38
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,040
Tomorrow.I'm beat.

39
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,090
You never sleep.Make yourself useful.

40
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,470
Most efficient killing machine ever invented.

41
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,320
You got her doing laundry.

42
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:50,180
You do never sleep.

43
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,500
One glazed.One rainbow sprinkle.One cinnamon twist.

44
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,450
You never forget,do you?

45
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,650
No,i don't.

46
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,170
So how was mexico?

47
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:38,140
Did you get to see your buddy down there?

48
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,630
Where's the rest of it?

49
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,410
He was gone when we got there.

50
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,640
After you went all that way?

51
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,820
Bummer.

52
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,990
Yes.

53
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,700
It was a bummer.

54
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,700
Is your brother still seeing that crazy blonde?

55
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,850
Yes.

56
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,670
It's become a problem.

57
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:02,960
She snuck out the window one night and left the alarm off.

58
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,900
We got robbed.

59
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,680
No way.

60
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,140
Did you catch who did it?

61
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,750
Everything worked out fine.

62
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,070
That's a pretty zen attitude.

63
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:26,310
"the robbed that smiles steals something from the thief."

64
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,270
You readothello.

65
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,060
You asked me to.

66
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,000
Did you like it?

67
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,630
It was more violent than i expected.

68
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,580
I should've warned you.

69
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,030
No.

70
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:42,160
Everything worked out fine.

71
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,760
You're not eating your donuts.

72
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,340
Later.

73
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:59,840
Do you havea history of california field artillery?

74
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,530
I'm interested in the ancient muzzle-loading rifles used during the modoc indian war.

75
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,800
Uh,in the california room.

76
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,770
I've a big week.

77
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,350
Paper due on thursday.

78
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:24,220
Peter the great's war with the turks and the technological modernization of imperial russia.

79
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,710
It's better than it sounds.

80
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,080
What are you lookin' at?

81
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,520
Him.

82
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,070
I know him.

83
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:01,100
Not unless you're about,oh,110 years old.

84
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,610
That photo's from 1920.

85
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:06,830
See,december 31,1920.

86
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:10,730
What was he doing in 1920?

87
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,380
What is this picture from?

88
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:16,110
Famous new year's eve speakeasy fire during prohibition.

89
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,800
43 people died.

90
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,200
There were rumors someone threw a molotov cocktail through the door.

91
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,640
Lots of rivalries between the different speakeasy clubs.

92
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,000
Over here.

93
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,220
Over here.

94
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:13,020
I need to know what happened to him.

95

98
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,960
Hello.

99
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:38,090
John,can you come get me?

100
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,640
Where?What's wrong?

101
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,870
At 341 grove way in van nuys.

102
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,610
Can you please just come?

103
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:56,310
Most periodicals from the '20s haven't been transferred to digital,

104
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,100
so this could take awhile.

105
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,340
But fire that big,there's always survivor stories.

106
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,830
Like with thetitanic.

107
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,790
You know,there's only one titanicsurvivor left,millvina dean.

108
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:13,170
Course,she was only two months old when it happened so her story isn't particularly instructive.

109
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,310
You're a very happy person.

110
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,980
I am?

111
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,720
I don't know that many happy people.

112
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,680
Well,i guess that's my own little survivor story.

113
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,850
Of course,having bone cancer was like being thetitanic and the iceberg.

114
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,820
So,uh,why do you want to find out about this guy?

115
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,410
I'm interested in the past.

116
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:38,030
It effects everything in the future.

117
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:41,410
Those who don't know history are destined to repeat it.

118
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:43,920
Or die.

119
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,460
What's wrong?

120
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,540
Little cold in here.

121
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,560
It's 76 degrees.

122
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,180
Check this one.

123
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,320
D6.

124
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:07,870
That's him.

125
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,590
That's the guy from the fire.

126
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,270
Who's that other man?

127
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:14,030
Rudolph valentino.

128
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,380
The greatest silent film star of all time?

129
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:25,310
Ugh,you kids today with your rock and roll and your obsession with medieval siege weapons.

130
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:30,360
Rudolph valentino and myron stark at the premiere ofthe sheik.

131
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,090
What was stark doing there?

132
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,900
Living it up on the red carpet.

133
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:42,090
I enjoyed your film very much,mr. Valentino.

134
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,030
Thank you.

135
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:45,660
Although i thought your decision to return the gun to lady diana to protect herself

136
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:51,690
From the caravan of thieves was misguided given that she was a security risk.

137
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,900
Stark is shaking hands with valentino.

138
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,660
But look at his eye line.He's looking at that man.

139
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,670
"rupert chandler."

140
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,410
Check out that hat.

141
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:10,530
We could search the city and county records for more on stark.

142
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:11,590
Where are they?

143
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:12,430
Basement.

144
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:15,330
Vital records.But it's locked and i don't have the keys.

145
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:18,030
You'll have to come back in the morning and talk with barry.

146
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:20,840
'Scuse me.Where are you going?

147
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:33,700
Hey,excuse me.

148
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,180
Looking for someone?

149
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,440
Uh,yeah,riley.

150
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,770
Blonde girl.

151
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,110
Uh,i barely know mike's friends.

152
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,430
Uh,gail silver.Mike's mom.

153
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:43,290
Oh,hi.I'm john.

154
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:45,690
Let me help you with these.

155
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,990
This is the wrong kind.

156
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,690
You said "beer.

157
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:58,470
" how come you never introduced me to your friend john?

158
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,690
'Cause he's not my friend.

159
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:03,600
Some loner weirdo who dropped out of school.

160
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,950
What are you doing here?

161
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,530
Just looking for somebody.

162
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,260
And being helpful.

163
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,010
You could learn a lesson from him.

164
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:14,130
What,like sucking up to mom?

165
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,300
Is the tv in your room broken?

166
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,950
It's kinda hard to relax when you're out here.

167
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,760
I gotcha.I'm goin'.

168
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:24,980
I didn't know you could just send your mom off to her room like that.

169
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,720
So?

170
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,980
Who you lookin' for?

171
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,050
Girl named riley.

172
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,700
Oh,i know riley.

173
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,230
Oh,got your beer!

174
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,920
Thanks.

175
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,460
Okay,thanks.

176
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,420
What are you doing?

177
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,760
You called me all upset.

178
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,900
What--what's goin' on?

179
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:49,460
Oh,that--that was just-- this guy was bothering me,that's all.

180
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,090
Well,i have a car.Let's go.

181
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:52,520
No.It's-- it's cool now.

182
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,570
Come on.We can hang out a little bit.

183
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:54,960
Hang out?

184
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,950
I only came to get you.

185
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,650
I'm sorry.

186
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,670
It's cool.We can--we can--we can stay.

187
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,790
Are you trying to get me fired?

188
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:16,440
No.

189
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,000
Then what are you doin' down here?

190
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,060
Looking for records on myron stark.

191
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,020
I don't think he was who everyone thinks he was.

192
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:25,480
I let you in after hours whenever you want.

193
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,640
And for you to go and do this,exactly what i tell you not to,

194
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,130
really not cool.

195
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,300
I need the information.

196
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,280
And i need this job.

197
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,840
You broke the lock.

198
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,610
I'll fix it.

199
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,000
Just put it back.

200
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,640
Put it all back.

201
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:46,490
Don't.

202
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm sorry.

203
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,390
I shouldn't have gone down there.

204
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,690
Forget it.

205
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:49,950
It's no big deal.

206
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,460
Yes,it is.

207
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,200
We're friends.

208
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,070
I don't really have many friends.

209
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,440
Actually,i don't have any friends.

210
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,180
You?That--that can't be true.

211
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:09,890
So did you find anything out down there?

212
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,620
No.

213
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:15,270
There's no record of myron stark before the fire.

214
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,530
Dead end.

215
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:17,960
I don't like dead ends.

216
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,430
He could've been an immigrant.

217
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,620
Came through ellis island,shortened his name.

218
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,510
Worked his way up from nothing.

219
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,620
It's the immigrant spirit.

220
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,260
Single-minded pursuit of a goal.

221
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,750
Never giving up.

222
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,810
Buying into the american dream.

223
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,890
An effective strategy.

224
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:38,140
Either that or he robbed banks.

225
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,240
What?

226
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,460
Can you show me police records?

227
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:56,280
Shortly after 2:00 pm,a lone robber held up the la brea savings and loan.

228
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,150
Witnesses say the masked man armed with a thompson submachine gun

229
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:02,120
And a daring disregard for human life opened fire.

230
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,800
Eight citizens were felled and did not live to tell about it.

231
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,100
This is the third bank robbed in this fashion in recent weeks.

232
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,560
Detective,can you tell us how much was looted from the vault?

233
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,610
Over $70,000 in cash,silver,and liberty bonds.

234
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,710
Was the robber injured in the fray?

235
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:18,460
Police let fly with a hail of bullets.

236
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,420
The robber was hit with nearly 30 rounds,but escaped on foot.

237
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,250
How in god's name did he survive?

238
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,740
That has not been ascertained.

239
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,070
A manhunt is underway.

240
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:33,330
You really think he robbed banks?

241
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:36,830
It's a very effective strategy.

242
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,950
But why?What did he need it for?

243
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:45,560
To buy into the american dream.

244
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:53,720
Stark bought parcels of land in the san fernando valley,burbank,sunland,van nuys.

245
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,740
Two days after the last heist.

246
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,940
What'd he do with all that land?

247
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,210
He built houses.

248
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:02,280
I found this application for a business license.

249
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,020
Construction.

250
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,570
This is worldwide news.

251
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,600
Myron stark versus rupert chandler.

252
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,940
A classic david versus goliath.

253
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:19,260
Real estate magnate and builder rupert chandler was the undisputed king of the expanding san fernando valley.

254
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,680
But along came a young upstart,myron stark.

255
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,080
What started as a one-man operation soon grew into a thriving business

256
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,890
That went head to head with the largest builder in the county.

257
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:31,560
It's said stark spoke six languages,paid double the wages of his competitors,

258
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:36,750
And treated all of his workers equally regardless of their employment history or citizen status.

259
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:40,100
Stark himself could always be found shoulder to shoulder with his workers,

260
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,000
A pickaxe in his strong hands.

261
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,080
Soon stark & company became a thorn in the side of his rival.

262
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:50,330
His meteoric rise threatened to topple the "king chandler" from his throne.

263
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:54,020
Chandler's top foreman,fred jeffers,was recently asked about the rivalry.

264
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,250
To hear jeffers tell it,"we're not worried.

265
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,600
"fly-by-nights like stark come and go.

266
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,230
"chandler's an established company with contracts "booked through 1925.

267
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,520
We'll crush him like a bug."

268
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:10,800
Upon hearing jeffers' fighting words,stark reported to reply simply,"we'll see."

269
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,600
Here's more on chandler and jeffers.

270
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,320
And something really strange.

271
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:20,620
Fred jeffers,rupert chandler's man,went missing back in 1925.

272
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,660
Was never found.

273
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,410
What is this?

274
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:32,370
A 17-round glock 9mm semiautomatic.

275
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:33,940
Why do you have it?

276
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,590
In case i need it.

277
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,830
Have you ever used it?

278
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,600
Yes.

279
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,090
Are you in trouble?

280
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:41,190
No.

281
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,760
Are you afraid of someone?

282
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,570
Afraid?

283
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,510
No.

284
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,870
I've seen cuts on your face.

285
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,040
There was one last week.

286
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,600
You were wearing makeup,but...

287
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,960
Sometimes i get into fights.

288
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,500
Wh--why?

289
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,060
My brother.

290
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,520
There are people out to hurt him.

291
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,590
I protect him.

292
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,610
Who protects you?

293
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:08,820
I do.

294
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,400
Why are we doing this?

295
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,250
Why is myron stark so important?

296
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,570
He was doing something,and it doesn't make sense to me.

297
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,760
I need to find out what it was.

298
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,930
None of this makes sense to me.

299
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:29,250
Not you,not the gun,not the guy in the photograph.

300
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:32,600
I know.

301
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:38,000
I've never fired a gun before.

302
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,190
Do you want to?

303
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:42,390
Sure,but...

304
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:43,580
Wait.

305
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,900
N--no.

306
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,090
We can't do this here.

307
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:49,940
Grip it with both hands.

308
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:53,350
Squeeze the trigger slowly.

309
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,430
Slowly.

310
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,740
Oh,yeah.

311
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,160
Oh,my god.I'm terrible at this.

312
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:29,290
John.

313
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,680
No,i don't know how.

314
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:34,220
What,you live in a cave?

315
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,320
Come on.

316
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:40,140
What am i supposed to do?

317
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,430
I have no idea.I just pushed those buttons at random.

318
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:45,060
And you sucked.

319
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,560
Hey,check you out,mr. Normal.

320
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,060
Kill him,alex.

321
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:55,680
Come on,johnny.I'm rooting for you.

322
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:07,370
Dude,you suck.

323
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,960
Hey,come on.Kill him,alex.

324
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:31,730
I'm gonna go.You stay here if you want.

325
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,230
No,john,wait.

326
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,310
This was a mistake.

327
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:36,300
Well,i-- i'm coming with you.

328
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,780
You're going?

329
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:38,710
With that weirdo?

330
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:41,460
Yeah.I'm sorry.We have to go.

331
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,800
Oh,no,no,no.Wait.

332
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,540
Give me my lighter back.

333
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,170
Your what?

334
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,370
You took my lighter.

335
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:50,380
No.C--no.Come on,john.Let's go.

336
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,140
No,no,no.Give it to me.Give it to me,weirdo.

337
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,100
Get off me.

338
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,470
-Hey,hey,you leave her alone.
-Hey,no one's talking to you,weirdo.

339
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:56,330
Don't.Don't.Stop.

340
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:58,210
Come on.

341
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,730
-Watch out,man.
-Give it to me,you screwy bitch.

342
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,650
John.

343
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:10,780
Take the damn lighter.

344
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,050
Come on,john.Let's get out of here.

345
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:22,970
I'm out here on mulholland drive where a hiker has discovered

346
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:28,060
What appears to be the body of a man who died over 60 years ago.

347
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:34,180
Tom jacobs was out for an early morning walk when he spotted a piece of metal in the ravine.

348
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,680
Tom?

349
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,940
I saw what looked like the bumper of a car.

350
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:41,550
But when i got closer,i could see that it was one of those old-timey ones,

351
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,600
You know,like--like you see in the movies.

352
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,840
And then i saw the bones.

353
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:52,220
Personal effects found in the vehicle reveal the remains to be those of fred jeffers,

354
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:56,640
A man who disappeared in the 1920s.

355
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,300
Wait!What are you doing?

356
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,060
What are you-- what do you want?

357
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,510
No!

358
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:16,290
Please stop!

359
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:18,580
No!

360
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:26,610
"jeffers' disappearance "was a terrible blow for chandler,

361
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:30,540
"who endured a string of tragedies "starting with the death of his beloved son will,

362
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:34,640
Who died on new year's eve,1920."

363
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:38,610
New year's eve,1920.

364
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,540
Let's get 'em out of here.

365
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,370
That's rupert chandler's boy.

366
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:50,150
Let's cover him up.Let's get him out of here.Come on.

367
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:01,740
Will chandler died in the speakeasy fire.

368
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,650
And myron stark was there.

369
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:06,850
So there must be a connection.

370
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:29,510
I thought you were gonna kill that guy.

371
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,180
Why'd you call me?

372
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,290
Because.

373
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:36,400
I wanted you to come.

374
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,060
Weird way of showing it.

375
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,620
Oh,the flirting with mike thing?

376
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,570
I'm a teenage girl,john.

377
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:48,280
We do that kind of crap to guys we like.

378
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,180
The loner weirdo?

379
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,730
I don't get it.

380
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,950
Never gotten it.

381
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,230
My old foster parents are these '60s hippies.

382
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:03,260
Always talking like they were single-handedly saving the world 

383
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,170
because they recycled.

384
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,390
They called me the deviant.

385
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:12,330
Like,"the deviant got a "c" in math."

386
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:16,420
"should we take the deviant to see bruce hornsby?"

387
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:20,730
That's why i came up to you that day,john.

388
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:27,860
Because i thought since you're a weirdo,you might get me.

389
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:33,430
My foster parents used to call me the delinquent.

390
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:39,290
So you did take the lighter.

391
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:42,050
I like shiny things.

392
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:46,930
Bad habit.

393
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:50,820
What happened to your real parents?

394
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:54,310
They died when i was little.

395
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:57,210
In a fire.

396
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,410
Why were you in a foster home?

397
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:03,040
You have your mom.

398
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:06,370
She was in a mental hospital.

399
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:09,620
That explains things.

400
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:17,320
She was engaged once.

401
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,170
He was a pretty cool guy.

402
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:25,390
Didn't work out,but he was kind of the only friend we had.

403
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:30,680
Little while ago,he,uh,helped us with something.

404
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,770
There was an accident and his new wife died.

405
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:42,380
And he left.

406
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:50,350
That's what happens.

407
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,060
I shouldn't be around people.

408
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:57,600
Is that why you went nuclear on mike?

409
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:03,040
No,that's...

410
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,330
That's other stuff.

411
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:08,590
Do you want to talk about it?

412
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,390
Sometimes,yes.

413
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,330
Mostly no.

414
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:20,600
But sometimes yes.

415
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,610
i found will chandler's obituary.

416
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:44,890
I'm kind of peeing right now.Can't it wait?

417
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:47,040
400 people came to his funeral.

418
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,300
He had a lot of friends.

419
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,950
His father had a lot of money.

420
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:51,200
There's a difference.

421
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,880
I think stark killed him.

422
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,920
We don't even know if they knew each other.

423
00:26:54,920 --> 00:27:00,080
And if stark wanted to kill chandler,why take out 43 innocent people?

424
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,650
It happens.

425
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,360
Do you ever think about dying?

426
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,420
About what?

427
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,600
Or about suicide?

428
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,900
Why would i think about that?

429
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,390
Because there's something wrong with you.

430
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:21,720
Gee,don't ever look for work as a counselor.

431
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:25,460
I've never thought about killing myself.

432
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,650
Not for a minute.

433
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:29,140
It would destroy my mom,for one.

434
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:33,010
I couldn't do that to my family,to the people who love me.

435
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:35,680
Could you?

436
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,620
Anyways,i'm not sick anymore.

437
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:41,540
I mean,i have to get a scan every six months.

438
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:46,340
But so far i'm clean.

439
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,940
Earlier when i cross-referenced the names of survivors from the fire,

440
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:57,180
This woman's name came up in a documentary about the roaring '20s.

441
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:00,300
It might tell us more about what happened inside the speakeasy.

442
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,840
Film vault's on the top floor.You'll have to go alone.

443
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,060
Why?

444
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:07,270
No wheelchair access.

445
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:13,250
You're really strong.

446
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,850
I work out.

447
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,820
Look at all this.

448
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:30,320
Dvds are all right,but this is the real deal.

449
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,620
Silver nitrate.Raw.

450
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:35,440
Before film makers figured out all the tricks.

451
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,820
Pure humanity on film.

452
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:41,770
None of that computer generated,digital crap they do today.

453
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:46,520
All these people captured,frozen in time.

454
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,790
They never age.

455
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,580
I mean,100 years could pass.

456
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:54,380
They'll still be here.Still look exactly the same.

457
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:57,200
It would be nice,wouldn't it?

458
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,920
Freeze yourself in a moment.

459
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,080
The best moment of your life.

460
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,910
Have things never change.

461
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:10,160
Be beautiful.Healthy.Strong.

462
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,550
Anyway...

463
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:18,700
Don't let me get all a.e.housman on you.

464
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:23,080
Uh,the documentaries are up there.

465
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:32,240
We would go out to the gin joints every weekend.

466
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:40,540
We'd drink,and smoke,and dance the black bottom,the charleston,the shimmy.

467
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:45,620
Oh,i was a real bearcat back then.

468
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:51,570
And i was crazy in love with this prizefighter.

469
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:58,360
We were together there,the night when the fire started.

470
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,890
He was helping everybody out.

471
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:05,640
And i just rember...

472
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:09,060
Sitting on the curb...

473
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,420
Crying.

474
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:15,920
People said that,uh,someone threw a bomb in the door.

475
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:20,420
Now,to tell you the truth,i was pretty zozzled.

476
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,960
That's what we called it then.

477
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,990
But i didn't see a bomb.

478
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:33,310
Uh,what i did see was this,um,this flash of blue light and sparks,

479
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:35,930
Then the craziest thing.

480
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:41,420
This man in the middle of the room,naked as a jaybird.

481
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:47,790
I don't know.Maybe i just imagined the whole thing.

482
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:50,100
Who knows?

483
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:53,850
Probably the liquor talking.

484
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:56,450
The fire,it was an accident.

485
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:58,910
Yeah,sounds like there was some electrical problem.

486
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:01,730
He didn't mean to kill all those people.

487
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:03,560
No.Of course not.

488
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:08,320
It's just like inthe wizard of oz when the house falls on the witch.

489
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:34,670
Give me your clothes.

490
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:58,120
Hey,where are you going?

491
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,500
I know what he was looking at.

492
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:04,130
He was measuring the stars' radial velocity,the distance in parsecs,

493
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,100
And the cartesian coordinates.

494
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,410
What?Why?

495
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:10,480
To pinpoint the date.

496
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,930
You can tell the date by looking at the sky?

497
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:30,250
Stellar motion can be used to calculate what the sky will look like for hundreds of years in the future or the past.

498
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:32,520
Why is the date so important?

499
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,620
It's not.

500
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,430
Unless it's the wrong date.

501
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:47,470
Myron stark was in the wrong place at the wrong time.

502
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,630
"if we cry because the sun has gone out of our lives,

503
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:01,190
"our tears can prevent us from seeing the stars."

504
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:04,090
Chandler's eulogy for his son?

505
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,380
"today is a day for mourning.

506
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:09,090
"but it is also a day to rember my son.

507
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:11,650
"a gifted young man with a grand heart.

508
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:15,380
"a budding architect,"his dream was to build pico tower "

509
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:17,240
on the corner of 3rd and pico.

510
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:20,660
"that was his land,"the soil where his dreams were to take root.

511
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:24,780
"it will remain his land forever,"never to be sold or developed.

512
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:31,220
"instead,his legacy will live on "in a memorial garden i will plant there in his honor."

513
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,270
That can't be right.

514
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:35,550
There is a pico tower in downtown la.

515
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:37,730
It's an architectural landmark.

516
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:40,940
We took a field trip there in third grade.

517
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:44,200
Someone must've built it.

518
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:48,660
Tax records.

519
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:51,980
They show chandler's rivalry with stark cost him everything.

520
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:54,560
His business went under in july 1925.

521
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,500
His assets were auctioned off to pay off his debt,

522
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,900
including the property at 3rd and pico.

523
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,030
Bankruptcy.

524
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:04,980
Tragic accidents.The death of a beloved son.

525
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:08,330
It's like the family's cursed.

526
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,070
Mr. Chandler,i'm myron stark.

527
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,270
Do i know you?

528
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,720
No,you don't know me.

529
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,430
Mr. Chandler's in a hurry.

530
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:23,400
I'm interested in purchasing a piece of property.

531
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:26,500
3rd and pico.

532
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,260
That land's not for sale.

533
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,170
I'll pay twice what it's worth.

534
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:34,210
Are you deaf?He said it's not for sale.

535
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,250
Does it say who bought it?

536
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:49,500
The pico property?

537
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,560
M.s.stark?

538
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,710
So he not only bought the land,but he designed it himself?

539
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:58,890
The building.

540
00:34:58,890 --> 00:34:59,910
It's about the building.

541
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:01,230
What is?

542
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:03,490
Stark accidentally killed the man who was going to build it,

543
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:05,480
So he had to build it himself.

544
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,760
Everything he did was to drive chandler under and get him to sell that land.

545
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,790
Okay.

546
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:15,760
There must be a reason why stark need to build it.

547
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:20,750
You wanna know the really weird thing?

548
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:25,160
Stark disappeared two weeks before the building opened in may of 1927.

549
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,070
Disappeared?

550
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,450
Fell off the face of the earth.

551
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:28,890
Never seen again.

552
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:31,270
What's happened at pico tower since it was built?

553
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:33,060
Anything important?

554
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,700
Anything on new year's eve?

555
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,780
New year's eve when?

556
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,010
Any new year's eve.

557
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,330
Not that i can see.

558
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:40,040
In fact,it's closed now.

559
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,500
They had to retrofit after the last earthquake.

560
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,600
I'm not sure when they're reopening.

561
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:13,340
I thought you left.

562
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,160
What are you doing back here?

563
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,490
Are you all right?

564
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:17,920
What happened?

565
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,230
I'm fine.

566
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:21,050
Your brother again?

567
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:23,270
I'm fine.

568
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:26,370
You never touched your donuts.

569
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:28,140
I wasn't hungry.

570
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,640
Your muscles are weak.

571
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,200
It was difficult for you to pull the trigger of the glock.

572
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,180
And you've lost 8% of your body weight in the past two weeks.

573
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:38,620
When i carried you to the film fault,i weighed you.

574
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:40,630
Wait,what?

575
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:44,460
This whole night,the entire time,you've been examing me?

576
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:47,760
What--what the hell is going on here?

577
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,810
Your cancer is back.

578
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:55,700
You have a secondary tumor in the long bone of your arm and possibly your lungs.

579
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,930
Are you joking?

580
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:58,170
No.

581
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:00,830
Then you're crazy,you don't know what you're talking about.

582
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:03,440
Ewing's sarcoma.First identified in the 1920s-- 

583
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,670
i know what it is,okay?

584
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:07,950
I'm the one in here!

585
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,280
No wonder you don't have any friends.

586
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,590
You can't just do things like that.

587
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:17,780
You can't just show up whenever you need somethin'.

588
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,940
You can't carry a gun around and freak people out,

589
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:25,670
And walk into the bathroom wh a guy's taking a leak and ask him if he's gonna kill himself.

590
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:30,090
And you can't just blurt things out like "you have cancer,"

591
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:33,850
Especially to someone who's already had it.

592
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:36,120
You have no clue,do you?

593
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:41,310
You have no idea what it's like to have something inside of you,

594
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:44,090
something that's damaged.

595
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:46,870
It's like a bomb...

596
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:50,240
Waiting to go off.

597
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:56,560
I need to finish my paper.

598
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,060
You should make an appointment with your oncologist.

599
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,160
The tumor's still small.

600
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,920
Get out.

601
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:42,430
Where were you all night?

602
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:44,150
Out.

603
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:47,600
Carbon chain c24.

604
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,990
Lanolin and red dye #27.

605
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:54,070
You were with riley.

606
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:23,840
We're closed.

607
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,340
Is eric here?

608
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,790
Eric?

609
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:30,120
He works the night shift.He lets me in.

610
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,730
I have no idea.They just called and asked me to come in.

611
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:34,520
Sorry.

612
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,210
Do you like donuts?

613
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:42,390
