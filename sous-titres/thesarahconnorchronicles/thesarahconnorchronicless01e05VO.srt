<i>my son will lead mankind
in a war against Skynet,</i>

00:00:12,587 --> 00:00:15,810
<i>a computer system programmed
to destroy the world.</i>

4
00:00:17,368 --> 00:00:20,035
<i>It has sent machines
back through time...</i>

5
00:00:20,475 --> 00:00:21,903
<i>some to kill him...</i>

6
00:00:22,305 --> 00:00:23,735
<i>one to protect him.</i>

7
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:27,456
<i>Today we fight to stop Skynet

8

<i>To change our future.</i>

9
00:00:30,407 --> 00:00:31,996

<i>Previously on</i> Terminator:
The Sarah Connor Chronicles...

14
00:00:46,501 --> 00:00:47,300
<i>He's here.</i>

15
00:00:47,502 --> 00:00:49,469
Are you forgetting
that I blew his head off?

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,390
- He came through. He knows we're here.
- It's just a head.

17
00:00:54,467 --> 00:00:56,182
<i>We're programmed to repair ourselves.</i>

18
00:00:56,976 --> 00:00:59,062
<i>We're programmed to blend in.</i>

19
00:01:00,387 --> 00:01:02,440
- There are other people here.
- Resistance fighters.

20
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,555
<i>Humans sent back from
the future by John.</i>

21
00:01:04,675 --> 00:01:06,528
<i>Who have money and guns.</i>

22
00:01:06,688 --> 00:01:08,446
<i>Jumper outside the gym!</i>

23
00:01:08,606 --> 00:01:10,115
It's my new friend.

24
00:01:10,275 --> 00:01:12,117
- The crying one.
- We gotta help her!

25
00:01:12,237 --> 00:01:12,937
No.

26
00:01:17,221 --> 00:01:19,874
<i>I need you to look at these photographs.
Tell me if you recognize anybody.</i>

27
00:01:20,399 --> 00:01:22,510
<i>The young one.
His name is Andrew Goode.</i>

28
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,070
He was an intern
at Cyberdyne one summer.

29
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,497
Do you wanna have dinner with me?

30
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,054
My turk plays chess
at at level that could defeat

31
00:01:30,713 --> 00:01:32,429
every human player that's ever lived,

32
00:01:32,589 --> 00:01:35,473
- and probably ever will live.
- <i>You talk about it like it's human.</i>

33
00:01:35,978 --> 00:01:36,975
You never know.

34
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:48,749
<i>Andy Goode must be killed.</i>

35
00:02:08,797 --> 00:02:12,219
<i>Of all the training my son received
in the jungles of Central America,</i>

36
00:02:12,905 --> 00:02:15,430
<i>nothing prepared him better for combat</i>

37
00:02:16,499 --> 00:02:18,266
<i>than the game of chess.</i>

38
00:02:21,472 --> 00:02:24,763
<i>It taught him almost everything
he needed to know about war.</i>

39
00:02:29,102 --> 00:02:30,779
<i>That to win you must be patient,</i>

40
00:02:33,224 --> 00:02:34,252
<i>bold,</i>

41
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,294
<i>calculating,</i>

42
00:02:39,403 --> 00:02:40,789
<i>and most of all...</i>

43
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,636
<i>willing to sacrifice.</i>

44
00:03:11,205 --> 00:03:12,136
Andy.

45
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,051
Haven't heard from you in a while.

46
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:16,991
<i>Sorry I've been out of touch.
But after the fire in my house...</i>

47
00:03:17,436 --> 00:03:19,994
<i>How can I explain?
It was kind of a blessing.</i>

48
00:03:20,595 --> 00:03:22,705
- <i>Can you meet me?</i>
- Where are you?

49
00:03:22,865 --> 00:03:25,376
A hotel in Pasadena.
I'm checking into a tournament.

50
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:26,417
<i>A tournament?</i>

51
00:03:26,577 --> 00:03:27,836
Yeah, you know, chess.

52
00:03:31,332 --> 00:03:33,800
Charley Dixon?
Agent Kester, FBI.

53
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:37,178
- I need to ask you a few questions.
- What is this about?

54
00:03:37,338 --> 00:03:38,752
Sarah Connor.

55
00:03:48,679 --> 00:03:50,546
Are you really good at math?

56
00:03:50,998 --> 00:03:51,875
Yes.

57
00:03:54,189 --> 00:03:55,669
You wanna do mine?

58
00:03:56,258 --> 00:03:57,080
Yes.

59
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:00,368
We got a problem.

60
00:04:00,778 --> 00:04:02,996
Andy Goode rebuilt his chess computer.

61
00:04:05,251 --> 00:04:06,199
The Turk.

62
00:04:06,809 --> 00:04:08,412
- But you napalmed it.
- Apparently

63
00:04:08,532 --> 00:04:11,045
he spent every minute since then
in a coffee shop in Van Nuys

64
00:04:11,205 --> 00:04:12,922
rewriting the code from memory.

65
00:04:13,912 --> 00:04:16,426
A good code is like a song in your head.
It's gotta come out.

66
00:04:16,586 --> 00:04:18,761
The song might just blow up the world.

67
00:04:18,921 --> 00:04:21,133
You should have killed him
when you had the chance.

68
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,183
And I'm surprised it's taken you
this long to bring that up.

69
00:04:24,758 --> 00:04:26,634
I'm doing John's homework.

70
00:04:30,558 --> 00:04:32,358
Andy entered it into a tournament.

71
00:04:32,888 --> 00:04:35,525
- Computer versus human?
- Computer versus computer.

72
00:04:35,645 --> 00:04:36,889
It's the new thing.

73
00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:39,616
These programs are too smart and
powerful to play people anymore.

74
00:04:39,776 --> 00:04:42,121
It gets better the more
we talk about it.

75
00:04:42,358 --> 00:04:43,623
You're going to school.

76
00:04:43,743 --> 00:04:45,830
You and Tin miss
can meet me there later.

77
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,707
You don't know anything about chess.

78
00:04:47,867 --> 00:04:49,925
I know a little bit about Andy.

79
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,795
Besides, you can't be absent.
Absent gets you on the radar.

80
00:04:53,372 --> 00:04:54,714
Okay, I get it.

81
00:04:55,276 --> 00:04:57,592
You go.
Can I have some money for lunch?

82
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,386
Isn't this awesome?

83
00:05:27,345 --> 00:05:28,998
God, I love robots.

84
00:05:34,497 --> 00:05:35,623
Come here.

85
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:46,584
- So is this one better or worse?
- Well, it's different, really.

86
00:05:47,145 --> 00:05:48,851
More adaptable, but less predictable.

87
00:05:49,011 --> 00:05:50,818
Not as powerful for now,

88
00:05:50,938 --> 00:05:52,355
but quicker on its feet.

89
00:05:52,515 --> 00:05:54,023
It has a hunger for learning,

90
00:05:55,251 --> 00:05:58,361
- but sometimes the lessons it learns...
- Sounds more human.

91
00:05:59,075 --> 00:06:01,581
Well, if you want an analogy,
I'd say that Turk I

92
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:03,449
had grown into a brooding teenager,

93
00:06:03,609 --> 00:06:06,285
and Turk II is still
more of a precocious child.

94
00:06:07,718 --> 00:06:09,639
Speaking of brooding and precocious,

95
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,815
this is my partner, Dimitri Shipkov.

96
00:06:12,103 --> 00:06:15,420
I built the Turk,
but Dimitri taught it to play chess.

97
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:18,840
She'll never sleep with you.
<i>Da, poka.</i>

98
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,458
- You should plug that in.
- Yep.

99
00:06:23,164 --> 00:06:26,383
Don't listen to him. He's just worked up
about the military contract.

100
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:28,451
We have a deal to split the money.

101
00:06:28,634 --> 00:06:30,184
What military contract?

102
00:06:30,534 --> 00:06:31,811
The one the winner gets.

103
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,863
Why don't you get your story straight?
Is she dead or isn't she?

104
00:06:42,023 --> 00:06:44,507
Sarah Connor survived
the explosion in the bank vault.

105
00:06:44,627 --> 00:06:45,658
So did her son.

106
00:06:45,818 --> 00:06:48,967
Yeah, that was eight years ago.
You guys just figured that out?

107
00:06:57,999 --> 00:06:58,755
Yes.

108
00:06:59,191 --> 00:07:00,027
Yes?

109
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,507
Yes, what?

110
00:07:02,013 --> 00:07:03,381
We just figured that out.

111
00:07:03,544 --> 00:07:05,470
Babe, who was that at the door?

112
00:07:08,174 --> 00:07:09,474
Good morning, ma'am.

113
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,247
He's from the FBI.

114
00:07:11,367 --> 00:07:13,061
I'm asking a few questions.

115
00:07:14,151 --> 00:07:16,568
- Charley, is something wrong?
- No.

116
00:07:16,766 --> 00:07:18,941
- I'm looking for the Connors.
- Sarah Connor?

117
00:07:19,101 --> 00:07:20,026
Your ex?

118
00:07:20,186 --> 00:07:22,070
- I'm looking for them here.
- Here?

119
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,655
Mr. Dixon wanted to marry
Sarah Connor before you.

120
00:07:24,815 --> 00:07:26,961
She's alive.
Maybe he's hiding her here.

121
00:07:27,186 --> 00:07:29,452
What?
I already told you, no.

122
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,047
No, okay?

123
00:07:32,573 --> 00:07:35,897
Look, all due respect, Agent Kester,

124
00:07:36,842 --> 00:07:39,157
the woman that I knew,
Sarah Reese,

125
00:07:39,362 --> 00:07:41,589
she blew herself up
in a bank eight years ago.

126
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:45,828
I never knew,

127
00:07:46,102 --> 00:07:48,554
and I do not know Sarah Connor.

128
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:59,355
If you see or hear anything, call me.

129
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,533
Any time,

130
00:08:03,286 --> 00:08:04,570
I never sleep.

131
00:08:18,453 --> 00:08:21,593
Just a reminder, grief counseling
will be available in my office

132
00:08:21,713 --> 00:08:22,797
throughout the week.

133
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:34,517
- What are they doing?
- They're writing notes.

134
00:08:34,924 --> 00:08:36,102
For Jordan.

135
00:08:38,431 --> 00:08:39,647
She's dead.

136
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,400
Yeah, I remember watching her fall.

137
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,431
Me too.

138
00:08:44,349 --> 00:08:45,938
How will she get the notes?

139
00:08:46,785 --> 00:08:47,864
She won't.

140
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,846
But you said...

141
00:08:49,966 --> 00:08:53,206
Sometimes things happen
and they're so bad,

142
00:08:54,238 --> 00:08:56,186
people don't know how to deal
with their sadness.

143
00:08:56,306 --> 00:08:57,498
They write it in a note.

144
00:08:57,658 --> 00:09:00,042
But I thought people cried
when they were sad.

145
00:09:00,563 --> 00:09:02,128
Sometimes it's not enough.

146
00:09:15,911 --> 00:09:16,973
Are you gonna...?

147
00:09:19,569 --> 00:09:21,199
I didn't really know her.

148
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:23,691
I didn't either.

149
00:09:25,569 --> 00:09:27,153
I like the note part.

150
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,157
Nice accent, white boy.

151
00:10:21,213 --> 00:10:24,043
I have no idea what's with those guys.
They're always messing with me.

152
00:10:26,506 --> 00:10:27,964
Yeah, man, I've no idea.

153
00:10:28,249 --> 00:10:29,249
I'm Morris.

154
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:30,508
John.

155
00:10:31,252 --> 00:10:33,503
I saw you talking to Cheryl Weston
this morning.

156
00:10:33,623 --> 00:10:36,681
Maybe no one told you cause you're new
but she's damaged goods.

157
00:10:37,461 --> 00:10:39,200
She's my chem partner.

158
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,502
- Do you know her or something?
- No one knows her.

159
00:10:41,626 --> 00:10:43,980
Something crazy went on
at the last school she was in, but

160
00:10:44,141 --> 00:10:45,819
no one knows what it is.

161
00:10:45,939 --> 00:10:47,733
Her dad's got her locked down tight.

162
00:10:49,623 --> 00:10:51,112
It's a pretty boring rumor.

163
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:52,571
It's truth.

164
00:10:52,731 --> 00:10:53,981
Not much of it.

165
00:10:56,094 --> 00:10:57,702
I'm just looking out for you, bro.

166
00:10:59,936 --> 00:11:01,956
Yeah, you and everyone else.

167
00:11:04,298 --> 00:11:05,584
<i>An extremely close match</i>

168
00:11:05,744 --> 00:11:07,127
<i>between the American and</i>

169
00:11:07,289 --> 00:11:09,694
<i>Japanese computers here
in the finals.</i>

170
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,840
<i>The Americans, led by programmer</i>

171
00:11:12,002 --> 00:11:15,072
<i>Andrew Goode,
have a slight positional advantage.</i>

172
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,337
<i>The Japanese seize control
of the center</i>

173
00:11:29,457 --> 00:11:31,027
<i>with bishop to C5.</i>

174
00:12:15,872 --> 00:12:18,522
Do you know how many
grand masters are here?

175
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:21,660
How's Andy doing?

176
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,204
Well, that depends on
what your plans are for Andy.

177
00:12:24,622 --> 00:12:26,915
On the one hand,
he's in the final round,

178
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:29,323
on the other hand...

179
00:12:30,061 --> 00:12:32,045
the winner gets a military contract.

180
00:12:33,617 --> 00:12:34,507
Military?

181
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:35,917
Are you serious?

182
00:12:40,256 --> 00:12:41,406
What do we do?

183
00:12:43,498 --> 00:12:45,378
Cheer very hard for the Japanese

184
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,248
or Cameron will kill him.

185
00:12:57,986 --> 00:12:59,740
<i>An unorthodox move by the Japanese,</i>

186
00:13:00,636 --> 00:13:02,951
<i>leaving their queen
hanging on D6 square.</i>

187
00:13:03,441 --> 00:13:05,870
<i>The American computer
calculating a response.</i>

188
00:13:12,454 --> 00:13:14,409
- What just happened?
- That bishop on C5

189
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:15,772
totally hammered him.

190
00:13:15,892 --> 00:13:17,550
Black's in total zugzwang.

191
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:18,642
Translation?

192
00:13:18,762 --> 00:13:20,728
The Japanese just lost their queen.

193
00:13:20,848 --> 00:13:22,096
They're in big trouble.

194
00:13:22,455 --> 00:13:23,805
Andy's gonna win.

195
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,580
So that was quite a speech earlier.

196
00:13:34,909 --> 00:13:35,943
With the agent.

197
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:38,498
That wasn't a speech,
it's was just...

198
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:39,864
it's just what it was.

199
00:13:42,514 --> 00:13:44,034
What it was, was a lie.

200
00:13:45,313 --> 00:13:46,036
What?

201
00:13:46,196 --> 00:13:47,020
A lie.

202
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,220
You have a tell.

203
00:13:52,455 --> 00:13:53,904
A what? A tell?

204
00:13:54,373 --> 00:13:55,623
You have a tell.

205
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,339
When you lie.

206
00:13:59,174 --> 00:14:01,087
Do you know why you love me,
Charley?

207
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,457
I'm gonna tell you why you love me.

208
00:14:04,204 --> 00:14:06,154
It's cause I'm not that girl.

209
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,330
I'm not that jealous girl.

210
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,680
I'm not that insecure girl.

211
00:14:10,981 --> 00:14:12,187
I'm not that petty girl.

212
00:14:12,348 --> 00:14:14,189
- Of course not.
- Yeah, so just don't

213
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:17,124
make me into that girl
by lying to me.

214
00:14:18,643 --> 00:14:21,393
If that woman is alive,
if you've seen her...

215
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,740
this is important.

216
00:14:33,579 --> 00:14:34,835
I saw John.

217
00:14:36,456 --> 00:14:37,305
What?

218
00:14:38,471 --> 00:14:39,298
Where?

219
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:40,307
Here.

220
00:14:40,925 --> 00:14:42,075
In our house.

221
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:44,065
In our house?

222
00:14:45,143 --> 00:14:46,096
In our house?

223
00:14:46,256 --> 00:14:47,264
What did he want?

224
00:14:47,892 --> 00:14:49,042
I don't know.

225
00:14:50,248 --> 00:14:52,101
I think he just wanted to see me.

226
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,063
What are you gonna do about it?

227
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,565
I don't know.

228
00:14:57,828 --> 00:14:59,297
They're fugitives, Charlie.

229
00:14:59,417 --> 00:15:01,237
They're dangerous people.

230
00:15:01,697 --> 00:15:03,042
Sarah's not dangerous.

231
00:15:03,162 --> 00:15:04,740
Maybe not the Sarah you knew.

232
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,450
Sarah Reese,
but Sarah Connor killed a man.

233
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,610
- We don't know that.
- Well, what do we know?

234
00:15:11,893 --> 00:15:13,243
What do you know?

235
00:15:27,078 --> 00:15:28,680
<i>The Japanese desperately hoping</i>

236
00:15:28,842 --> 00:15:30,886
<i>for counterplay after
the disastrous loss</i>

237
00:15:31,052 --> 00:15:32,302
<i>of their queen.</i>

238
00:15:33,203 --> 00:15:34,519
<i>Victory appears imminent</i>

239
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,980
<i>for the Americans.</i>

240
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:39,208
<i>Andy Goode's Turk seized control
of the match in the middle game,</i>

241
00:15:39,328 --> 00:15:42,078
<i>and now appears just
moves away from winning.</i>

242
00:15:54,032 --> 00:15:55,213
<i>Rook to C2.</i>

243
00:15:56,814 --> 00:15:59,083
<i>Checkmate.
A shocking turn of events.</i>

244
00:15:59,203 --> 00:16:01,325
<i>The Japanese team has won
the tournament</i>

245
00:16:01,445 --> 00:16:03,048
<i>and the military contract.</i>

246
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:08,883
It's over.

247
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,386
- Andy lost.
- But the other team...

248
00:16:12,506 --> 00:16:14,763
They didn't lose their queen,
they sacrificed it.

249
00:16:14,928 --> 00:16:17,378
Just like Byrne-Fischer
all over again.

250
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,356
Byrne-Fischer, 1956?

251
00:16:20,819 --> 00:16:23,527
- Never mind. The point is...
- The Turk fell for a trap?

252
00:16:23,687 --> 00:16:25,404
It's like it just... choked.

253
00:16:25,841 --> 00:16:26,822
So now, what?

254
00:16:27,717 --> 00:16:29,575
- We go after them now?
- No, their names

255
00:16:29,735 --> 00:16:31,285
weren't in the safe house.

256
00:16:31,507 --> 00:16:32,745
Andy's was.

257
00:16:32,905 --> 00:16:36,600
What computational error? You put
the bishop on E6 to begin with!

258
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,258
I can't help it if it's stupid!

259
00:16:38,378 --> 00:16:40,461
Nobody's gonna want
Andy's program now.

260
00:16:40,707 --> 00:16:44,089
- That thing's kind of crazy.
- He could still be a threat.

261
00:16:45,452 --> 00:16:48,509
- It could still become Skynet.
- It could also become Pong.

262
00:16:49,331 --> 00:16:50,554
What are you gonna do?

263
00:16:51,131 --> 00:16:52,281
I don't know.

264
00:16:52,632 --> 00:16:55,224
Maybe I'll just sit Andy
down and tell him everything.

265
00:17:19,101 --> 00:17:20,101
Andy.

266
00:18:06,596 --> 00:18:07,506
Who are you?

267
00:18:19,949 --> 00:18:21,477
Put your hands above your head!

268
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:22,774
Do it now!

269
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:23,624
Turn!

270
00:18:23,744 --> 00:18:24,599
Turn!

271
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:26,539
Spread 'em!

272
00:18:26,977 --> 00:18:28,776
Put your hands behind your back.

273
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:31,289
Over here.

274
00:18:51,538 --> 00:18:53,099
I'm so sorry, Andy.

275
00:19:15,461 --> 00:19:16,366
What's this?

276
00:19:17,163 --> 00:19:19,013
You should write Andy a note

277
00:19:19,351 --> 00:19:20,701
if you can't cry.

278
00:19:39,216 --> 00:19:41,349
Doesn't bother you
that he's dead, does it?

279
00:19:41,726 --> 00:19:43,351
The world is safer without him.

280
00:19:44,296 --> 00:19:45,436
That was way too easy.

281
00:19:45,597 --> 00:19:47,647
LAPD firewalls really blow.

282
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:50,423
- Show me what you found.
- Okay.

283
00:19:51,022 --> 00:19:51,889
No name,

284
00:19:52,009 --> 00:19:52,758
but

285
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:54,695
he's got this tattoo on his arm.

286
00:19:55,821 --> 00:19:56,907
He's one of them.

287
00:19:59,945 --> 00:20:01,951
That's a tattoo from a Skynet work camp.

288
00:20:02,071 --> 00:20:03,413
He's a resistance fighter.

289
00:20:03,626 --> 00:20:06,291
From the future.
Like the three guys in the safe house?

290
00:20:06,451 --> 00:20:08,385
- He was the fourth.
- Then you know him.

291
00:20:08,505 --> 00:20:10,303
- In the future.
- So do you.

292
00:20:10,872 --> 00:20:12,972
He's one of your best soldiers.

293
00:20:13,725 --> 00:20:15,425
They've been watching Andy Goode.

294
00:20:15,585 --> 00:20:17,094
Doing surveillance.

295
00:20:17,254 --> 00:20:18,355
Same as us.

296
00:20:18,605 --> 00:20:20,273
Well, not exactly the same.

297
00:20:20,525 --> 00:20:23,141
- He actually killed the guy.
- That was not his mission.

298
00:20:24,344 --> 00:20:25,936
You sent him here to wait for us.

299
00:20:26,545 --> 00:20:29,106
Well, then I guess he changed his mind.
A lot.

300
00:20:30,423 --> 00:20:32,025
I have to talk to him.

301
00:20:33,434 --> 00:20:34,962
Talk to him?
How?

302
00:20:35,689 --> 00:20:37,209
He's in lockdown.

303
00:21:02,084 --> 00:21:03,190
Freeze.

304
00:21:14,352 --> 00:21:15,569
What are you doing?

305
00:21:15,945 --> 00:21:16,951
Math.

306
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:19,114
I already did your homework.

307
00:21:19,274 --> 00:21:21,408
Yeah, I know,
but I still have to take the test.

308
00:21:22,454 --> 00:21:24,256
I need to know this stuff.

309
00:21:25,386 --> 00:21:27,539
Then why did you ask me to do it?

310
00:21:31,144 --> 00:21:34,223
Because maybe it's kinda hard
to concentrate on geometry when

311
00:21:34,401 --> 00:21:36,131
people keep dying around you.

312
00:21:38,935 --> 00:21:41,104
You have no idea
what I'm talking about, do you?

313
00:21:41,368 --> 00:21:42,387
You're grieving.

314
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:46,850
Grieving?

315
00:21:47,816 --> 00:21:49,436
How do you know what grieving is?

316
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:51,275
I read all the notes.

317
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:54,066
Cameron Baum,
Mr. Harris wants to see you.

318
00:22:02,816 --> 00:22:05,716
I know this is difficult
for you to talk about,

319
00:22:05,955 --> 00:22:08,254
so I'm gonna need you to be strong.

320
00:22:09,088 --> 00:22:09,990
Okay?

321
00:22:10,408 --> 00:22:12,556
- Can you do that for me?
- Yes.

322
00:22:12,676 --> 00:22:13,974
I can be strong.

323
00:22:14,617 --> 00:22:16,296
People say you were the last person

324
00:22:16,456 --> 00:22:18,215
to speak with Jordan before she...

325
00:22:19,096 --> 00:22:20,096
Died.

326
00:22:20,825 --> 00:22:22,724
- Is that true?
- I don't know.

327
00:22:23,463 --> 00:22:27,463
Are you asking me if people say
I was the last person to talk to Jordan,

328
00:22:27,734 --> 00:22:30,602
or are you asking me if I was
the last one to talk to her?

329
00:22:31,275 --> 00:22:34,272
- I guess I'm asking if you were.
- I don't know.

330
00:22:35,034 --> 00:22:37,150
What did she say
when you did talk to her?

331
00:22:37,765 --> 00:22:39,895
I mean,
was it something

332
00:22:40,438 --> 00:22:42,261
upsetting for you to hear?

333
00:22:44,257 --> 00:22:45,356
She said,

334
00:22:46,883 --> 00:22:48,335
"You saw it, right?

335
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,417
"Right?
You saw it?

336
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,836
It's so freakin' big
and right out there."

337
00:23:01,215 --> 00:23:03,515
She was talking about the graffiti?

338
00:23:04,004 --> 00:23:05,405
It's freakin' big.

339
00:23:07,075 --> 00:23:07,873
Yes.

340
00:23:09,696 --> 00:23:10,851
Yes, it is.

341
00:23:11,215 --> 00:23:12,294
And no.

342
00:23:12,499 --> 00:23:13,201
No?

343
00:23:13,321 --> 00:23:16,023
No, it wasn't upsetting
for me to hear it.

344
00:23:16,183 --> 00:23:17,964
Did Jordan mention any names?

345
00:23:18,084 --> 00:23:19,547
Any specific people

346
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:20,944
that she was upset with?

347
00:23:21,203 --> 00:23:22,404
Her parents.

348
00:23:22,564 --> 00:23:24,614
- Anyone else?
- The hall monitors.

349
00:23:24,774 --> 00:23:25,907
Anyone else?

350
00:23:27,805 --> 00:23:29,536
You ask that question a lot.

351
00:23:31,531 --> 00:23:34,229
Is there anything else
you want to tell me?

352
00:23:36,585 --> 00:23:39,024
I don't think I told you anything.

353
00:23:43,354 --> 00:23:44,468
Can I go now?

354
00:23:45,564 --> 00:23:48,638
I'm done with grief counseling,
and I feel much better.

355
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:49,701
Yeah,

356
00:23:50,258 --> 00:23:51,573
please.
Go.

357
00:24:18,078 --> 00:24:20,234
Yo, John Doe, you got a visitor.

358
00:24:27,095 --> 00:24:28,246
Those hurt?

359
00:24:30,632 --> 00:24:34,331
Sometimes they crank those tight
before they bring you in here.

360
00:24:34,857 --> 00:24:37,505
That way,
you might ask me to loosen them up.

361
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:39,898
And I am able
to accommodate you in that.

362
00:24:41,126 --> 00:24:42,726
It's a trick they do.

363
00:24:43,895 --> 00:24:45,695
It gives us a connection.

364
00:24:48,005 --> 00:24:50,206
But we already got a connection.

365
00:24:58,694 --> 00:25:00,595
Your prints are everywhere.

366
00:25:06,996 --> 00:25:09,056
Oven, light switch, toilet.

367
00:25:10,123 --> 00:25:11,068
Safe.

368
00:25:13,485 --> 00:25:16,082
Wasn't us who found it.
But somebody did.

369
00:25:17,491 --> 00:25:19,586
After the police thought
they cleared the scene,

370
00:25:19,706 --> 00:25:22,607
somebody came back and
emptied the safe right quick.

371
00:25:22,974 --> 00:25:24,684
Didn't force it either.

372
00:25:24,804 --> 00:25:26,608
They knew the combination.

373
00:25:28,005 --> 00:25:28,806
So.

374
00:25:30,116 --> 00:25:33,869
We've got you running from the
scene of Andrew Goode's murder.

375
00:25:34,445 --> 00:25:36,204
And we've got you living at,

376
00:25:36,364 --> 00:25:39,035
and disappearing from,
and most likely returning

377
00:25:39,155 --> 00:25:41,668
to the scene
of these three murders.

378
00:25:43,256 --> 00:25:46,057
All of which would be
a prosecutorial bounty.

379
00:25:47,056 --> 00:25:50,177
But I've also got forensic evidence,

380
00:25:50,337 --> 00:25:51,685
linking this

381
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:54,986
to this

382
00:25:58,081 --> 00:25:59,246
and this.

383
00:26:02,935 --> 00:26:04,536
Feeling connected yet?

384
00:26:12,034 --> 00:26:13,232
What is it?

385
00:26:15,395 --> 00:26:17,645
The forensic evidence
linking all these people...

386
00:26:17,765 --> 00:26:18,788
What is it?

387
00:26:19,316 --> 00:26:20,262
Blood.

388
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,481
Not my blood.

389
00:26:24,455 --> 00:26:26,458
No, not your blood.

390
00:26:28,424 --> 00:26:30,342
And, technically, not even blood.

391
00:26:31,295 --> 00:26:33,094
Some kind of synthetic.

392
00:26:35,935 --> 00:26:37,732
Come on, man, help me out.

393
00:26:38,315 --> 00:26:40,414
Tell me something I don't know.

394
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:52,190
We're all gonna die.

395
00:26:58,714 --> 00:27:01,514
Yeah,
I want him out of local custody today.

396
00:27:01,844 --> 00:27:05,440
He has more to say and I want him
on federal turf when he says it.

397
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:22,925
Yes, this is Cameron's mother.

398
00:27:23,045 --> 00:27:27,045
<i>Mrs. Baum, do you aware of the recent
tragedy we've had here at school?</i>

399
00:27:27,526 --> 00:27:29,651
- Jordan somebody.
<i>- Tallen.</i>

400
00:27:29,811 --> 00:27:31,525
When I spoke to Cameron about it,

401
00:27:31,645 --> 00:27:34,152
she seemed strangely

402
00:27:34,524 --> 00:27:35,665
unaffected.

403
00:27:35,785 --> 00:27:38,243
I'm sure you're doing
all you can as a parent.

404
00:27:38,545 --> 00:27:40,755
It's been overwhelming for all of us,

405
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:42,576
first with the tornado,

406
00:27:43,535 --> 00:27:45,638
<i>- then the move.</i>
- Tornado?

407
00:27:46,619 --> 00:27:48,921
<i>I'm sorry,
she didn't mention that.</i>

408
00:27:49,754 --> 00:27:52,132
<i>That might explain what I think</i>

409
00:27:52,292 --> 00:27:55,970
- might be post-traumatic stress.
- You're gonna have to speak up.

410
00:28:18,896 --> 00:28:20,243
You shouldn't be here.

411
00:28:20,403 --> 00:28:23,304
- I know who you are.
- And I know who you are.

412
00:28:26,426 --> 00:28:27,896
Who else but Sarah Connor

413
00:28:28,016 --> 00:28:30,378
would have burned down
that poor kid's house?

414
00:28:30,686 --> 00:28:32,225
It was you, wasn't it?

415
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,758
On Andy's porch that night.
You've been watching.

416
00:28:36,686 --> 00:28:38,094
You wanted to kill him,

417
00:28:38,664 --> 00:28:40,347
the poor kid, and you did.

418
00:28:44,665 --> 00:28:45,966
I didn't do it.

419
00:28:48,875 --> 00:28:50,675
All I wanted was the Turk.

420
00:28:51,171 --> 00:28:53,193
Somebody else killed him
and took the machine.

421
00:28:53,653 --> 00:28:54,544
What?

422
00:28:54,873 --> 00:28:56,859
He was dead when I got there.

423
00:28:57,273 --> 00:28:58,884
He was dead and the Turk was gone,

424
00:28:59,004 --> 00:29:01,527
- and I hoped you'd done it.
- You thought I killed him?

425
00:29:01,647 --> 00:29:02,702
But you're here.

426
00:29:04,185 --> 00:29:05,983
And the Turk is out there.

427
00:29:08,626 --> 00:29:10,338
So we both failed.

428
00:29:18,086 --> 00:29:19,636
You gotta get out of here.

429
00:29:20,264 --> 00:29:23,125
If you haven't figured it out,
I have a T-888 on my ass.

430
00:29:23,245 --> 00:29:24,748
Now if you found me,

431
00:29:25,834 --> 00:29:26,933
it will too.

432
00:29:27,178 --> 00:29:28,645
- We should get you out.
- Go.

433
00:29:30,295 --> 00:29:33,483
Find the partner, the Russian.
He's gotta be neck-deep in this also.

434
00:29:33,643 --> 00:29:35,026
- You're dead in here.
- Go!

435
00:29:36,016 --> 00:29:37,019
Please.

436
00:29:39,482 --> 00:29:42,700
I won't be the bastard who brings
metal down on the Connors, so just go.

437
00:29:49,167 --> 00:29:51,000
You're prettier than your picture.

438
00:29:52,155 --> 00:29:53,155
Picture?

439
00:29:54,686 --> 00:29:56,589
Yeah, it's actually how I clocked you.

440
00:29:58,984 --> 00:30:01,219
My brother carried your snap for luck.

441
00:30:01,379 --> 00:30:02,720
Who's your brother?

442
00:30:03,996 --> 00:30:05,297
What does it matter?

443
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:08,380
You don't know the Reese boys,
and you never will.

444
00:30:09,585 --> 00:30:10,603
Reese boys?

445
00:30:10,763 --> 00:30:11,983
Derek Reese.

446
00:30:13,736 --> 00:30:15,037
Brother's Kyle.

447
00:30:23,757 --> 00:30:26,428
<i>When John sent Kyle Reese
back to protect me,</i>

448
00:30:26,949 --> 00:30:28,621
<i>we had two days together.</i>

449
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,708
<i>He told me about the future,</i>

450
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,743
<i>about the apocalypse,</i>

451
00:30:36,044 --> 00:30:38,729
<i>and the terror of a world
run by machines.</i>

452
00:30:54,165 --> 00:30:56,000
<i>Kyle reese saved my life.</i>

453
00:30:56,576 --> 00:30:58,109
<i>He gave me a son.</i>

454
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:05,902
<i>He never told me
that he had a brother.</i>

455
00:31:07,286 --> 00:31:09,793
<i>He never told me
we would have family.</i>

456
00:31:10,697 --> 00:31:12,957
<i>That in our grief we are not alone.</i>

457
00:31:19,705 --> 00:31:20,725
Cheri.

458
00:31:22,801 --> 00:31:24,383
- Cheri.
- Walk away.

459
00:31:25,838 --> 00:31:27,000
John, please.

460
00:31:42,034 --> 00:31:44,197
Lock and key, bro.
Lock and key.

461
00:31:45,417 --> 00:31:46,560
Mom's here.

462
00:31:48,951 --> 00:31:49,661
Hi.

463
00:31:49,821 --> 00:31:52,580
I'm Morris.
Your brother's new best friend.

464
00:31:54,575 --> 00:31:55,625
Cameron.

465
00:31:56,613 --> 00:31:57,685
Nice grip.

466
00:32:02,175 --> 00:32:03,503
Watch yourself.

467
00:32:04,106 --> 00:32:05,654
Just lookin' out for ya.

468
00:32:12,051 --> 00:32:13,017
Field trip.

469
00:32:13,177 --> 00:32:14,489
I call shotgun.

470
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:17,065
I call 9-millimeter.

471
00:32:17,765 --> 00:32:19,819
What's the ETA on my prisoner?

472
00:32:20,503 --> 00:32:21,551
All right.

473
00:33:26,561 --> 00:33:27,550
Drop it.

474
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:28,479
Now.

475
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:29,355
Run.

476
00:33:30,254 --> 00:33:31,304
You stay close.

477
00:33:31,465 --> 00:33:33,149
Take the jeep and follow us.

478
00:33:38,473 --> 00:33:39,729
You metal bitch.

479
00:33:41,224 --> 00:33:42,732
She's on our side.

480
00:33:49,334 --> 00:33:51,199
T-888.
Lose him.

481
00:35:07,643 --> 00:35:09,188
- Let's go.
- Where's Cameron?

482
00:35:09,308 --> 00:35:11,571
- Leave her, let's go.
- Let's go.

483
00:35:18,154 --> 00:35:19,203
Stay back!

484
00:35:33,377 --> 00:35:34,136
Get out!

485
00:35:55,439 --> 00:35:56,741
Bring me the toolbox.

486
00:36:06,809 --> 00:36:08,044
Switchblade.

487
00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:13,549
Pliers.

488
00:36:45,969 --> 00:36:47,342
We have to help him.

489
00:36:47,462 --> 00:36:49,836
- Don't let it touch me.
- We have to stop your bleeding.

490
00:36:49,996 --> 00:36:51,504
- Get away.
- Don't move.

491
00:36:51,664 --> 00:36:53,650
You're increasing your blood loss.

492
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,268
I can't fix it.

493
00:37:05,428 --> 00:37:06,811
You took a bullet outta me.

494
00:37:06,971 --> 00:37:08,229
He has internal damage.

495
00:37:08,389 --> 00:37:11,226
He needs medical attention,
or he's gonna die.

496
00:37:19,483 --> 00:37:20,491
A stun gun.

497
00:37:20,651 --> 00:37:23,114
- Are you nuts?
- He needs a doctor.

498
00:37:23,333 --> 00:37:25,079
You're gonna go out and kidnap one?

499
00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:27,623
There's an ER a mile away.
It's almost dark.

500
00:37:27,783 --> 00:37:30,251
Mom, this is crazy, all right.
Even for you, it's insane.

501
00:37:30,411 --> 00:37:33,035
- We have to save him.
- And what happens when you get caught?

502
00:37:33,205 --> 00:37:35,354
- We have to save him.
- You don't know who he is.

503
00:37:35,541 --> 00:37:37,024
He's your uncle.

504
00:37:39,365 --> 00:37:40,428
He doesn't know.

505
00:37:41,995 --> 00:37:43,823
He's your father's brother.

506
00:37:44,577 --> 00:37:45,892
His name's Derek Reese.

507
00:37:53,726 --> 00:37:54,724
John.

508
00:37:57,605 --> 00:37:58,838
Two females,

509
00:37:59,249 --> 00:38:02,209
approximately 5'6",
120 pounds,

510
00:38:02,893 --> 00:38:05,140
overpower you
and your partner,

511
00:38:06,524 --> 00:38:08,009
ambush your secure vehicle,

512
00:38:08,129 --> 00:38:09,677
and kidnap my prisoner.

513
00:38:10,664 --> 00:38:13,628
That an accurate summation of
what happened out here today, officer?

514
00:38:17,475 --> 00:38:18,352
Yeah.

515
00:38:24,914 --> 00:38:26,242
5'6".

516
00:38:27,831 --> 00:38:29,133
5'6".

517
00:38:51,201 --> 00:38:53,996
<i>If there is a flaw in chess
as a game of war,</i>

518
00:38:54,201 --> 00:38:55,434
<i>it is this:</i>

519
00:38:56,247 --> 00:38:57,529
<i>unlike war,</i>

520
00:38:57,803 --> 00:38:59,720
<i>the rules of chess are constant.</i>

521
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,638
<i>The pieces unchangeable.</i>

522
00:39:02,349 --> 00:39:05,651
<i>You will never win the heart
of a rook or the mind of a knight.</i>

523
00:39:06,144 --> 00:39:08,281
<i>They are deaf to your arguments.</i>

524
00:39:08,952 --> 00:39:10,267
<i>And so be it.</i>

525
00:39:20,605 --> 00:39:23,523
<i>The goal of a chess game
is total annihilation.</i>

526
00:39:25,852 --> 00:39:28,523
<i>But, in war, even as the blood
beats in your ears</i>

527
00:39:28,643 --> 00:39:30,579
<i>and you race after your enemy,</i>

528
00:39:30,913 --> 00:39:33,365
<i>there is the hope that saner minds
than yours will stop you</i>

529
00:39:33,485 --> 00:39:35,584
<i>before you reach your target.</i>

530
00:39:36,406 --> 00:39:37,433
<i>In war,</i>

531
00:39:37,981 --> 00:39:40,283
<i>unlike chess, rules can be changed.</i>

532
00:39:40,747 --> 00:39:42,309
<i>Truces can be called.</i>

533
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:46,213
<i>The greatest of enemies
can become the best of friends.</i>

534
00:39:46,733 --> 00:39:47,774
Derek.

535
00:39:49,816 --> 00:39:50,829
Derek.

536
00:39:52,405 --> 00:39:53,857
He's not breathing.

537
00:39:54,268 --> 00:39:55,281
