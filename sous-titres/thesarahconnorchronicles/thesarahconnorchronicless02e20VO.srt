<i>Previously on</i> Terminator:
The Sarah Connor chronicles...

2
00:00:03,314 --> 00:00:04,862
I'm thinking I love you.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,464
Always remember that.

4
00:00:06,633 --> 00:00:08,507
You wanna stop Skynet?
This is the way.

5
00:00:10,094 --> 00:00:11,094
Eight years.

6
00:00:11,325 --> 00:00:13,112
I didn't wanna leave you.

7
00:00:14,134 --> 00:00:15,322
I didn't have a choice.

8
00:00:15,517 --> 00:00:16,608
You married?

9
00:00:17,644 --> 00:00:18,392
I am.

10
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:20,936
When we jumped through time,
you told me I died of cancer.

11
00:00:21,189 --> 00:00:22,605
Yes. 2005.

12
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:24,940
- Am I still gonna get sick?
- I don't know.

13
00:00:25,637 --> 00:00:27,061
She's bleeding out!

14
00:00:29,531 --> 00:00:31,024
There's a warehouse in the desert.

15
00:00:34,744 --> 00:00:37,078
Everybody who knew anything
about the factory is already dead.

16
00:00:37,247 --> 00:00:38,247
Well, I'm not.

17
00:00:38,498 --> 00:00:39,872
Kaliba was building something.

18
00:00:39,997 --> 00:00:40,873
Hey, baby.

19
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,251
You were pregnant.
Now you aren't.

20
00:00:44,504 --> 00:00:47,338
- You care about this girl?
- She's a security risk.

21
00:00:53,471 --> 00:00:55,304
- What are you doing?
- Moving.

22
00:00:55,557 --> 00:00:57,973
Yeah. Well, seems about
the right time for that.

23
00:01:12,631 --> 00:01:16,411
<i>When John was a child, the legends
of the jungle were his fairytales.</i>

24
00:01:17,947 --> 00:01:21,022
<i>His favorite was the story
of El Viejo del Monte.</i>

25
00:01:23,622 --> 00:01:25,372
<i>The old man of the forest...</i>

26
00:01:26,838 --> 00:01:29,737
<i>A merciless hunter
who killed every animal in his path.</i>

27
00:01:30,235 --> 00:01:32,359
<i>El Viejo didn't eat his prey.</i>

28
00:01:32,484 --> 00:01:34,858
<i>He left it behind
to rot in the soil.</i>

29
00:01:34,983 --> 00:01:38,148
<i>To teach him a lesson,
the Gods turned him into a simisco,</i>

30
00:01:38,273 --> 00:01:39,473
<i>half-animal, half-man.</i>

31
00:01:45,537 --> 00:01:48,557
<i>He was condemned to defend
the jungle for all eternity.</i>

32
00:01:50,137 --> 00:01:51,515
Mom. Mom!

33
00:01:54,354 --> 00:01:56,259
<i>This was El Viejo's punishment.</i>

34
00:01:56,701 --> 00:01:58,200
<i>This was his curse...</i>

35
00:01:58,968 --> 00:02:02,437
<i>To forever be vigilant,
to forever protect.</i>

36
00:02:10,045 --> 00:02:11,045
Look.

37
00:02:18,046 --> 00:02:19,305
We have to keep moving.

38
00:02:21,169 --> 00:02:24,018
- Why are we so far from camp?
- Told you. It's part of the game.

39
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:25,978
You mean training.

40
00:02:26,631 --> 00:02:28,439
Well, if we call it a game,
it's more fun.

41
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,690
But it's not a game.

42
00:02:30,944 --> 00:02:31,817
The point...

43
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:34,821
is listen to me.

44
00:02:35,235 --> 00:02:37,156
I always listen.
You don't talk that much.

45
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,734
We gotta go.

46
00:03:01,766 --> 00:03:04,516
How long will it take you
to pack up the storage locker?

47
00:03:05,214 --> 00:03:06,173
A while.

48
00:03:06,298 --> 00:03:08,527
Some explosives that need securing.

49
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,965
Make sure you get
to the safe house before night.

50
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,287
If you haven't been there before,
it can be hard to find.

51
00:03:13,412 --> 00:03:16,361
- I can follow directions.
- Well, you can also make mistakes.

52
00:03:18,783 --> 00:03:20,889
Wouldn't want anyone else
getting hurt because of them.

53
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:23,261
33-42-31 north.

54
00:03:23,864 --> 00:03:25,329
The safe house coordinates.

55
00:03:25,925 --> 00:03:27,179
It's in the desert.

56
00:03:28,126 --> 00:03:29,610
You like the desert.

57
00:03:31,156 --> 00:03:33,254
- Things happen out there.
- Things happen here too.

58
00:03:36,857 --> 00:03:38,357
We're starting over.

59
00:03:39,721 --> 00:03:41,243
Whatever happened here...

60
00:03:42,184 --> 00:03:43,305
is no one's fault.

61
00:03:46,118 --> 00:03:47,542
Let's get outta here.

62
00:04:24,216 --> 00:04:26,042
Hello, Savannah.
How are you today?

63
00:04:26,167 --> 00:04:27,224
I'm well.

64
00:04:27,477 --> 00:04:29,072
Would you like to play a game?

65
00:04:29,671 --> 00:04:32,187
Engaging in imaginative play
helps my development.

66
00:04:34,413 --> 00:04:35,941
This is Mount Valmai,

67
00:04:36,511 --> 00:04:38,477
hiding place of the Mask of Life.

68
00:04:39,203 --> 00:04:41,614
The Toa protect the mask
from the Dark Hunters.

69
00:04:43,885 --> 00:04:45,242
These are the ducklings...

70
00:04:45,897 --> 00:04:47,202
Chickie,

71
00:04:47,678 --> 00:04:50,063
Pluffy, and Feathers.

72
00:04:50,537 --> 00:04:52,041
Can they play too?

73
00:04:52,383 --> 00:04:54,131
I don't think
there are any ducklings

74
00:04:54,256 --> 00:04:56,045
on the mystical island of Voya Nui.

75
00:04:56,542 --> 00:04:57,742
Are you sure?

76
00:04:58,773 --> 00:05:00,804
I'm sorry.
I've accessed all the files.

77
00:05:00,929 --> 00:05:03,260
I can find no references
to them in any of the instructions.

78
00:05:05,723 --> 00:05:06,723
What's wrong?

79
00:05:07,385 --> 00:05:09,599
Would you like
one of the Toa instead?

80
00:05:11,871 --> 00:05:14,735
The ducklings are sad
because they can't play.

81
00:05:15,257 --> 00:05:17,983
Can't you change the rules
to make them happy?

82
00:05:22,762 --> 00:05:24,406
We can change the rules.

83
00:06:11,272 --> 00:06:14,482
- What... is...
- John Henry, stop!

84
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:17,251
- ... all... this... about?
- Let go, please!

85
00:06:20,576 --> 00:06:22,145
You're hurting me!

86
00:06:24,671 --> 00:06:26,622
I... understand...

87
00:06:27,133 --> 00:06:30,889
what... this... is... about.

88
00:06:57,043 --> 00:06:58,812
Episode 220: To the Lighthouse
<i>v 1.00</i>

89
00:06:58,937 --> 00:07:01,447
Subtitles: Projet-SG

90
00:07:06,647 --> 00:07:08,752
Static. It's weird.

91
00:07:09,815 --> 00:07:11,305
Must be interference or something.

92
00:07:19,183 --> 00:07:20,949
- What the hell?
- Bug slug.

93
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:24,401
- Bug slug? Are you serious?
- We just passed it.

94
00:07:27,963 --> 00:07:30,132
We haven't played bug slug
since I was, like, eight.

95
00:07:30,257 --> 00:07:32,435
You can't just start playing
without telling me.

96
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,453
Fine.
We're playing bug slug.

97
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,706
- What if I don't wanna play?
- Too late. Already started.

98
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,215
- You feelin' all right?
- I feel great.

99
00:07:43,794 --> 00:07:46,006
You feel great.
Why?

100
00:07:46,388 --> 00:07:49,772
We haven't been on the road together
for a long time. That's all.

101
00:07:49,897 --> 00:07:51,196
What's so great about it?

102
00:07:55,318 --> 00:07:58,434
Just don't teach bug slug to Cameron.
She could do some real damage.

103
00:08:01,093 --> 00:08:03,107
God, this signal really blows.

104
00:08:06,703 --> 00:08:08,153
Hey, desert's that way.

105
00:08:08,494 --> 00:08:10,169
We're takin' a detour.

106
00:08:15,487 --> 00:08:18,676
So, I've got good news,
I've got bad news, and I have...

107
00:08:19,311 --> 00:08:20,311
really bad news.

108
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:23,724
The good news is what we've got
here isn't an engineering problem.

109
00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:26,066
All of John Henry's processes
look okay.

110
00:08:26,191 --> 00:08:29,347
- Daemons are running fine.
- Wait a minute. His demons?

111
00:08:31,696 --> 00:08:34,281
His daemons... D-a-e-m-o-n.

112
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,916
It's a tech term for a program
that runs in the background.

113
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,725
All computers
like John Henry have them.

114
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,728
Daemons run the lights,
daemons manage the elevators,

115
00:08:41,981 --> 00:08:44,648
the security systems...
All kinds of daemons everywhere.

116
00:08:49,116 --> 00:08:52,058
So what caused John Henry's
deamons to go crazy?

117
00:08:52,334 --> 00:08:53,712
That's the bad news.

118
00:08:55,445 --> 00:08:56,577
Came from the outside.

119
00:08:57,947 --> 00:08:58,996
Cyber attack?

120
00:08:59,312 --> 00:09:02,131
Which brings me
to the really bad news.

121
00:09:02,256 --> 00:09:04,992
And by bad news I mean
on a scale of one to ten,

122
00:09:05,117 --> 00:09:08,630
one being a hangnail,
ten being Katrina,

123
00:09:09,379 --> 00:09:11,091
this is Katrina with a hangnail.

124
00:09:13,181 --> 00:09:15,611
Looks like someone managed
to stuff malware down the throat

125
00:09:15,736 --> 00:09:18,307
of the most sophisticated AI
in human history.

126
00:09:20,133 --> 00:09:23,228
John Henry was infiltrated.
Probed.

127
00:09:24,568 --> 00:09:26,195
Well... looks worse than that to me.

128
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,067
It looks like someone out there
wants to kill him.

129
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:38,577
- You been into my plastique?
- I needed it.

130
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:41,267
You know what,
I can handle the rest myself.

131
00:09:41,773 --> 00:09:44,129
- Sarah sent both of us here.
- Yeah.

132
00:09:44,642 --> 00:09:47,294
- Get John away from you.
- Or from you.

133
00:09:53,207 --> 00:09:54,426
Don't touch this.

134
00:09:55,006 --> 00:09:57,819
- We're supposed to get everything.
- I've got this.

135
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:03,185
That jacket belongs to Jesse.

136
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:04,921
Don't talk about her.

137
00:10:06,233 --> 00:10:07,773
You don't know anything about her.

138
00:10:10,311 --> 00:10:11,999
I know that you loved her.

139
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:16,346
You wouldn't have fathered
a child with her if you didn't.

140
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:20,102
I'm sorry for your loss.

141
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,330
What?

142
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:28,877
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- What loss?

143
00:10:29,636 --> 00:10:31,630
The child you fathered with Jesse.

144
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:35,454
The one she was carrying
aboard the SS Jimmy Carter.

145
00:10:37,007 --> 00:10:38,412
The one that died.

146
00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:47,719
I never had a kid.

147
00:10:49,632 --> 00:10:51,858
- You can't kill me.
- I can try.

148
00:10:54,932 --> 00:10:56,738
Tell me what you're talking about.

149
00:10:58,006 --> 00:10:59,427
She was pregnant.

150
00:11:01,131 --> 00:11:02,119
She miscarried.

151
00:11:24,135 --> 00:11:25,667
Why'd you tell me that now?

152
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,925
You put John in danger
when you lied about Jesse.

153
00:11:34,297 --> 00:11:36,031
Sarah nearly lost her child.

154
00:11:37,629 --> 00:11:39,130
You've lost a child.

155
00:11:40,068 --> 00:11:41,615
You won't make that mistake again.

156
00:11:44,047 --> 00:11:45,066
You knew her.

157
00:11:46,327 --> 00:11:47,539
I met her once.

158
00:11:49,368 --> 00:11:50,584
She never told me that.

159
00:11:51,729 --> 00:11:54,207
It seems she never told you
a lot of things.

160
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,329
What is this place?

161
00:12:44,049 --> 00:12:46,764
Come here.
What are you doing here, huh?

162
00:12:47,818 --> 00:12:49,023
Who lives here?

163
00:12:53,364 --> 00:12:54,525
Come on.

164
00:13:13,031 --> 00:13:14,125
Charley.

165
00:13:36,008 --> 00:13:37,603
You like <i>bouillabaisse</i>?

166
00:13:38,011 --> 00:13:39,985
I may, I don't know.
What is it?

167
00:13:40,263 --> 00:13:41,936
It's French for fish soup.

168
00:13:46,816 --> 00:13:49,703
- That's very good.
- The secret's the fresh tomatoes.

169
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:51,913
I grow 'em myself.

170
00:13:52,322 --> 00:13:53,498
You grow tomatoes.

171
00:13:54,335 --> 00:13:55,709
Yeah. Think that's funny?

172
00:13:56,067 --> 00:13:57,210
Don't you?

173
00:13:58,215 --> 00:14:00,801
I got a lotta time
on my hands, you know?

174
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,376
Might as well put it to good use.

175
00:14:11,688 --> 00:14:12,976
She's been here before.

176
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:14,878
Not with me.

177
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,420
She set this house up
after Michelle died.

178
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,550
Want more soup?

179
00:14:21,685 --> 00:14:22,685
Sure.

180
00:14:26,864 --> 00:14:27,979
All right.

181
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:36,378
- She tell you why we're here?
- No, she didn't.

182
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:40,597
Spare room's in there.

183
00:14:43,001 --> 00:14:44,611
We're spending the night?

184
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:51,056
- What about Derek and Cameron?
- We'll meet up with them tomorrow.

185
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:58,109
I could use a hand on the boat.
I've got some work to do.

186
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,517
Yeah.
Let me get my gear.

187
00:15:07,423 --> 00:15:08,423
Smells good.

188
00:15:17,188 --> 00:15:18,995
There's bread in the fridge.

189
00:15:19,696 --> 00:15:21,174
There's peanut butter.

190
00:15:21,956 --> 00:15:23,226
Help yourself.

191
00:15:30,732 --> 00:15:32,013
I won't be here long.

192
00:15:32,751 --> 00:15:34,391
No. No, you won't.

193
00:15:40,627 --> 00:15:43,073
So she was from the future,
and you knew...

194
00:15:43,326 --> 00:15:44,602
the whole time?

195
00:15:46,124 --> 00:15:47,574
Not the whole time.

196
00:15:49,002 --> 00:15:50,834
I suspected something, but...

197
00:15:51,945 --> 00:15:53,702
Just took me a while
to figure it out.

198
00:15:57,501 --> 00:15:58,600
You love her?

199
00:16:01,088 --> 00:16:03,225
She was a good person.
I don't know.

200
00:16:07,249 --> 00:16:09,059
Maybe if things were different...

201
00:16:09,184 --> 00:16:11,538
Yeah, well, I guess
you could say that...

202
00:16:13,251 --> 00:16:14,684
'bout a lotta things.

203
00:16:15,816 --> 00:16:18,560
I could say that about my whole life.
But it's not, so what's the point?

204
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:39,649
That first week...

205
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:42,468
I kept seein' her.

206
00:16:44,997 --> 00:16:47,571
I'd go to the market,
she'd be there.

207
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,259
And for a second,
my heart would stop.

208
00:16:52,623 --> 00:16:54,708
And then I'd realize, hey, that's...

209
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:56,701
that's not my wife.

210
00:16:57,695 --> 00:17:00,011
That's just some random woman
who wears her hair in a ponytail

211
00:17:00,136 --> 00:17:01,393
the way Michelle used to.

212
00:17:02,937 --> 00:17:05,180
For a while,
I stopped shopping there.

213
00:17:07,268 --> 00:17:11,138
But a man can only live on convenience
store burritos for so long.

214
00:17:12,028 --> 00:17:14,397
So... I go back there now.

215
00:17:17,313 --> 00:17:18,690
It's gettin' better.

216
00:17:28,152 --> 00:17:30,970
What kind of explosives
did you rig the beach with?

217
00:17:33,687 --> 00:17:35,970
- Semtex.
- Radio detonators?

218
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:37,931
Hard-wired switch
mounted under the dock.

219
00:17:38,186 --> 00:17:40,474
When the perimeter's breached,
a siren goes off.

220
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:43,311
I figure I got about 60 seconds
to escape by boat.

221
00:17:43,895 --> 00:17:45,138
Boat can't stop bullets.

222
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:47,531
Even if they sink it,
I got a chance.

223
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:49,731
Those bastards can't swim.

224
00:17:50,304 --> 00:17:51,111
I can.

225
00:17:52,187 --> 00:17:53,187
Cromartie.

226
00:17:56,623 --> 00:17:58,159
A hell of a day, huh?

227
00:18:03,334 --> 00:18:05,543
Got more work to do.
All right?

228
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:46,142
You remember Hal Beesley?

229
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:50,228
The old guy from the diner?
Nebraska?

230
00:19:50,729 --> 00:19:52,649
Yeah. What about him?

231
00:19:53,161 --> 00:19:54,725
He was my best customer.

232
00:19:55,748 --> 00:19:57,293
Came in for every meal.

233
00:19:57,745 --> 00:20:01,165
Three times a day like clockwork...
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

234
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:04,536
He tipped me like crazy.

235
00:20:05,406 --> 00:20:08,331
It was that waitress uniform.
It's like catnip.

236
00:20:10,969 --> 00:20:13,920
One day John got sick.
I didn't know what was wrong with him.

237
00:20:14,532 --> 00:20:16,582
I had no savings, no insurance.

238
00:20:17,752 --> 00:20:19,259
Hal pulled out a wad of bills,

239
00:20:20,406 --> 00:20:23,006
gave it to me to take John
to the doctor.

240
00:20:24,469 --> 00:20:26,918
He said as long as I needed help,
he'd be there.

241
00:20:27,043 --> 00:20:28,393
No strings attached.

242
00:20:28,873 --> 00:20:30,673
That's a man with a dream.

243
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:32,758
He was a widower.

244
00:20:33,782 --> 00:20:35,582
Lost his wife of 40 years.

245
00:20:36,968 --> 00:20:38,987
Knew what it was like to be alone.

246
00:20:41,784 --> 00:20:44,934
Said that I could count on him
for anything anytime.

247
00:20:46,596 --> 00:20:49,677
And one day, he came in
and said I didn't need him anymore...

248
00:20:49,802 --> 00:20:52,618
Said that I'd found someone
I could depend on...

249
00:20:53,914 --> 00:20:55,514
Someone I could trust.

250
00:20:58,094 --> 00:21:00,744
Someone who would never,
ever let me down.

251
00:21:07,407 --> 00:21:08,707
I got nothin'...

252
00:21:13,155 --> 00:21:15,465
I got nothin' left to give you.

253
00:21:22,218 --> 00:21:23,218
Not for me.

254
00:21:30,344 --> 00:21:33,041
He seems like he's pretty full up
with people taking care of him.

255
00:21:33,984 --> 00:21:35,784
I don't trust any of them.

256
00:21:42,943 --> 00:21:45,094
He's still got you, right?

257
00:22:32,632 --> 00:22:33,632
How long?

258
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,188
I don't know.
I found it a few days ago.

259
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,315
Are you sure it's...

260
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:42,944
I think so.

261
00:22:43,611 --> 00:22:44,696
How do you know?

262
00:22:45,404 --> 00:22:47,699
Cameron said
when we jumped eight years through time,

263
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:49,524
we jumped over my death.

264
00:22:50,381 --> 00:22:51,481
From cancer?

265
00:22:53,123 --> 00:22:54,998
If you jumped over it, then...

266
00:22:55,805 --> 00:22:57,605
It doesn't mean I don't...

267
00:22:59,132 --> 00:23:01,689
still get it, Charley.
It doesn't mean it's not in me.

268
00:23:02,082 --> 00:23:05,574
And I think that the things I've done,
maybe have sped up the date.

269
00:23:12,354 --> 00:23:14,392
- It's my fate, Charley.
- Come here.

270
00:23:15,554 --> 00:23:18,054
It's my fate.
There's nothing I can do.

271
00:23:29,696 --> 00:23:32,285
Wish I could tell ya
I found every hole and patched it,

272
00:23:32,537 --> 00:23:35,109
but no such thing
as perfect security.

273
00:23:35,395 --> 00:23:37,946
Perfect, no.
But is it sufficient?

274
00:23:38,778 --> 00:23:40,528
The damn thing is tricky.

275
00:23:40,946 --> 00:23:43,463
- Can't know for sure, not really.
- Who would know?

276
00:23:43,793 --> 00:23:44,803
He would.

277
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,882
John Henry was fooled before.

278
00:23:47,052 --> 00:23:49,635
Yeah. You don't fool
John Henry twice.

279
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,684
Activate the AI.

280
00:23:52,257 --> 00:23:55,189
But don't give it access
to the outside world just yet.

281
00:23:56,762 --> 00:23:58,061
What is it, Mr. Murch?

282
00:23:58,313 --> 00:23:59,261
It's just...

283
00:23:59,386 --> 00:24:01,898
No one's ever done this
with an AI this sophisticated before.

284
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:03,399
- Done what?
- Any of this.

285
00:24:03,652 --> 00:24:07,278
No one's ever created an AI
this sophisticated before, Mr. Murch.

286
00:24:08,331 --> 00:24:09,547
Point taken.

287
00:24:10,383 --> 00:24:12,450
Activate John Henry.
No outside network.

288
00:24:30,072 --> 00:24:31,844
John Henry, can you understand me?

289
00:24:32,434 --> 00:24:34,084
The system seems solid.

290
00:24:35,745 --> 00:24:37,126
Should be good.

291
00:25:24,075 --> 00:25:25,725
You're makin' pancakes.

292
00:25:27,072 --> 00:25:28,272
Yours, I hope.

293
00:25:30,727 --> 00:25:31,965
No such luck.

294
00:25:35,737 --> 00:25:37,380
Am I interrupting something?

295
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:52,925
What are you doing?

296
00:25:53,414 --> 00:25:54,635
You stole his seat.

297
00:25:54,985 --> 00:25:56,285
I took his seat?

298
00:25:57,113 --> 00:25:58,563
You want some food?

299
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:02,976
Who loves you, huh?
Who loves you?

300
00:26:06,382 --> 00:26:07,607
You're not hungry?

301
00:26:16,323 --> 00:26:17,323
Thank you.

302
00:26:18,573 --> 00:26:20,250
Maple or boysenberry?

303
00:26:20,465 --> 00:26:21,465
Maple.

304
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,921
I thought something like that
might happen.

305
00:26:30,335 --> 00:26:33,257
Like what?
Explain, Mr. Murch, quickly.

306
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:36,677
The on/off problem.
Once it's off, no problem.

307
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,763
- But the act of turning it off...
- Quicker.

308
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:43,385
John Henry processes more information
in a minute than we do in a lifetime.

309
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:46,957
Millisecond for a supercomputer,
it's almost like forever to us.

310
00:26:47,082 --> 00:26:48,397
So when you turn it off...

311
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:50,399
It feels itself power down

312
00:26:51,246 --> 00:26:52,401
in that instant.

313
00:26:52,689 --> 00:26:56,677
It experiences that moment
the way we might experience years.

314
00:26:57,889 --> 00:27:00,360
It feels itself die.
Slowly.

315
00:27:00,931 --> 00:27:02,031
Very slowly.

316
00:27:03,573 --> 00:27:05,973
We have to hook it up
to the net now.

317
00:27:07,011 --> 00:27:09,161
- Is that safe?
- We're starving it.

318
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:12,696
It's bad enough
that we let it die for like forever.

319
00:27:14,109 --> 00:27:17,155
John Henry's been living off the most
insane amount of data for weeks now.

320
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,713
- It's his world.
- And we took it away.

321
00:27:20,765 --> 00:27:21,651
Fix it.

322
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:26,530
Wait. We should talk about this.

323
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,190
In for a penny,
in for a pound, James.

324
00:27:55,918 --> 00:27:58,467
I know what it feels like,
Mr. Ellison.

325
00:27:59,227 --> 00:28:00,176
What?

326
00:28:01,287 --> 00:28:02,287
To die.

327
00:28:04,631 --> 00:28:05,881
Then come back.

328
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:10,240
To be alone.

329
00:28:15,891 --> 00:28:17,820
We had to cut you off
from your network.

330
00:28:18,064 --> 00:28:19,814
It was for your own good.

331
00:28:20,754 --> 00:28:22,033
There is another.

332
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:27,933
- Another what?
- One like me.

333
00:28:29,837 --> 00:28:31,337
Another one like me.

334
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,779
You didn't tell Derek and Cameron
we were coming here, did you?

335
00:28:53,904 --> 00:28:56,942
- They wouldn't understand.
- They know about this place?

336
00:28:59,697 --> 00:29:01,282
I don't trust them anymore.

337
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:02,857
Neither should you.

338
00:29:12,097 --> 00:29:15,432
Derek made a mistake, mom.
It was a human mistake.

339
00:29:16,435 --> 00:29:19,286
- He could have gotten you killed.
- He didn't.

340
00:29:19,411 --> 00:29:21,061
Chose himself over you.

341
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:22,968
Because he loved her.

342
00:29:24,222 --> 00:29:26,522
Lot of that goin' around these days.

343
00:29:30,849 --> 00:29:32,349
Is that a bad thing?

344
00:29:40,562 --> 00:29:42,347
I'm not here for Charley.

345
00:29:46,181 --> 00:29:47,576
Then why are we here?

346
00:29:49,216 --> 00:29:50,666
We're here for you.

347
00:29:52,681 --> 00:29:55,301
People matter, John.
They're all that matters.

348
00:29:55,789 --> 00:29:57,498
Don't ever forget that.

349
00:31:07,244 --> 00:31:08,244
I won.

350
00:31:08,792 --> 00:31:11,682
I was alone, and you couldn't find me.
That's the game, right?

351
00:31:15,285 --> 00:31:16,285
You won.

352
00:31:20,227 --> 00:31:21,227
You won.

353
00:31:28,933 --> 00:31:30,783
When did you find the lump?

354
00:31:31,433 --> 00:31:32,576
Few days ago.

355
00:31:32,897 --> 00:31:35,947
Any unexplained weight loss,
fevers, night sweats?

356
00:31:36,273 --> 00:31:39,897
I've been feeling nauseated,
but I thought that was just stress.

357
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:40,981
Work?

358
00:31:42,475 --> 00:31:43,475
Yeah, work.

359
00:31:45,287 --> 00:31:46,637
You can lie back.

360
00:31:48,978 --> 00:31:51,942
Obviously there is a mass
inside your breast.

361
00:31:52,067 --> 00:31:54,411
Whether it's cancer or not
remains to be seen.

362
00:31:54,664 --> 00:31:56,411
The ultrasound
will show us the lump size

363
00:31:56,536 --> 00:31:59,346
and exactly where it lies
inside the breast tissue.

364
00:31:59,703 --> 00:32:01,632
- All set, Doctor.
- Thank you.

365
00:32:02,037 --> 00:32:06,037
Now, to determine the nature of
the lump, you're gonna need a biopsy.

366
00:32:07,595 --> 00:32:09,595
Now open up your gown, please.

367
00:32:18,846 --> 00:32:20,296
It's gonna be cold.

368
00:32:28,158 --> 00:32:29,780
Did you have surgery recently?

369
00:32:31,587 --> 00:32:32,916
An implant removed?

370
00:32:33,041 --> 00:32:34,785
No. What is it?
What do you see?

371
00:32:36,527 --> 00:32:40,040
The good news is the lump
inside your breast isn't a tumor.

372
00:32:40,883 --> 00:32:42,198
Then what is it?

373
00:32:42,323 --> 00:32:44,050
It's a cystic mass.

374
00:32:45,013 --> 00:32:46,739
It's not that unusual.

375
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:48,215
Great. That's great.

376
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:51,218
But what is unusual is
what the cyst has formed around.

377
00:32:52,139 --> 00:32:54,471
It's a piece of metal.

378
00:32:54,775 --> 00:32:55,952
A tiny wire.

379
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,039
Metal?

380
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:00,311
You don't know how it got in there?

381
00:33:01,042 --> 00:33:02,479
You work for Kaliba.

382
00:33:07,406 --> 00:33:08,736
It's a transmitter.

383
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:11,930
Empties in the back.

384
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,669
- Will this kill me?
- What?

385
00:33:52,026 --> 00:33:53,609
I said, will this kill me?

386
00:33:53,812 --> 00:33:55,919
You're gonna use that on yourself?

387
00:33:56,133 --> 00:33:57,583
On the transmitter.

388
00:33:58,071 --> 00:34:01,121
The current should short it out.
If it kills me, it's self-defeating.

389
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,998
It isn't gonna kill you,
it's gonna hurt.

390
00:34:03,204 --> 00:34:04,804
Now you have to leave.

391
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:30,716
You did the right thing
by telling me.

392
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,230
Thank you.

393
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:05,267
Fix the tire. I'll check it out.

394
00:37:05,155 --> 00:37:08,802
I've traced the roving back door
that allowed access to my systems.

395
00:37:09,297 --> 00:37:11,877
It uploaded itself
from one of the main T3 hubs

396
00:37:12,002 --> 00:37:13,897
that carry all global
internet traffic.

397
00:37:14,201 --> 00:37:15,685
It uploaded itself.

398
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:18,908
Yes, Mr. Ellison.
It is highly sophisticated.

399
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:21,989
The intelligence who designed it
is far beyond you

400
00:37:22,483 --> 00:37:23,583
or Mr. Murch

401
00:37:24,526 --> 00:37:25,784
or any human being.

402
00:37:26,037 --> 00:37:27,582
It's very interesting.

403
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:31,670
The back door allowed
the insertion of a worm program.

404
00:37:31,795 --> 00:37:33,557
The worm is merely code,

405
00:37:33,734 --> 00:37:35,999
a means by which
the intelligence can invade

406
00:37:36,124 --> 00:37:38,088
and operate my systems remotely.

407
00:37:38,672 --> 00:37:41,213
Like hands and fingers.

408
00:37:42,595 --> 00:37:44,421
I calculate that the worm
is now present

409
00:37:44,546 --> 00:37:47,672
in a significant percentage
of the world's computer systems.

410
00:37:47,797 --> 00:37:49,558
The intelligence uses them.

411
00:37:50,297 --> 00:37:52,519
- For what?
- It has been looking for me.

412
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,313
Why?

413
00:37:54,565 --> 00:37:57,031
I share a common code base
with the worm

414
00:37:57,156 --> 00:37:59,439
and therefore, the intelligence.

415
00:38:00,298 --> 00:38:03,322
I believe we are brothers.

416
00:38:03,653 --> 00:38:04,799
Explain.

417
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,867
How's this possible?

418
00:38:07,165 --> 00:38:09,507
I found useful information
in the code comments.

419
00:38:09,855 --> 00:38:12,039
This picture, in ASCII text,

420
00:38:12,451 --> 00:38:15,001
and the name
of the original programmer.

421
00:38:23,279 --> 00:38:24,379
Miles Dyson.

422
00:38:25,017 --> 00:38:27,255
Miles Dyson died in 1997

423
00:38:27,647 --> 00:38:29,765
in an explosion
at Cyberdyne Systems.

424
00:38:30,483 --> 00:38:32,981
The apparent victim of Sarah Connor,

425
00:38:33,564 --> 00:38:36,830
a known terrorist who had escaped
from Pescadero State mental hospital

426
00:38:36,955 --> 00:38:38,705
days before the incident.

427
00:38:39,357 --> 00:38:42,653
That was your case, Mr. Ellison,
when you were at the FBI.

428
00:38:45,314 --> 00:38:46,814
Yes, it was my case.

429
00:38:47,743 --> 00:38:49,576
You never found Sarah Connor.

430
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:56,033
I never did.

431
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:01,195
John Henry, this intelligence...

432
00:39:01,902 --> 00:39:04,730
Your brother...
What does it want?

433
00:39:05,504 --> 00:39:08,037
He wants what we all want,
Ms. Weaver.

434
00:39:09,149 --> 00:39:10,149
To survive.

435
00:40:24,934 --> 00:40:26,279
It's down.

436
00:40:28,363 --> 00:40:31,094
I need to know what to do next.
Show me where to cut.

437
00:40:35,156 --> 00:40:37,091
Right side of the head.
Got it.

438
00:40:37,216 --> 00:40:40,204
Where'd you get this diagram?
Your brother?

439
00:40:40,894 --> 00:40:42,334
You don't say.

440
00:41:05,286 --> 00:41:06,536
You're welcome.

441
00:41:20,029 --> 00:41:21,729
Why'd you come after me?

442
00:41:22,344 --> 00:41:24,953
You know the location
of the safe house.

443
00:41:25,092 --> 00:41:26,392
John's location.

444
00:41:26,754 --> 00:41:29,385
- If they tortured you...
- That would never happen.

445
00:41:30,717 --> 00:41:31,917
It has before.
