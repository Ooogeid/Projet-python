<i>Previously on </i>Terminator:
The Sarah Connor Chronicles...

2
00:00:03,095 --> 00:00:06,796
There's a warehouse in the desert.
They're building something there...

3
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:07,757
metal.

4
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:09,508
- Who are you?
- Winston.

5
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:10,808
Where's the metal?

6
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:17,975
I talked to your mom.
She found something.

7
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,769
Is it real this time?

8
00:00:20,146 --> 00:00:22,605
I detected this audio
transmission on an unsecured line.

9
00:00:22,774 --> 00:00:25,733
<i>- Got a breach... man shot out.
- Shut the place down!</i>

10
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:32,043
You mind telling me where you keep
your demolition materials?

11
00:00:34,977 --> 00:00:36,243
God, I hate funerals.

12
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,746
Anybody who knew anything
is already dead.

13
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:40,214
Well, I'm not.

14
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,667
Did you know my husband, Sarah?

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,294
The whole place was wired,
every house.

16
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,807
Every move anyone ever made
was being watched.

17
00:00:47,932 --> 00:00:51,592
Mom, you've been sick.
Chasing robots will do that to you.

18
00:00:54,573 --> 00:00:56,683
<i>Midnight is the witching hour...</i>

19
00:00:58,302 --> 00:01:02,152
<i>If you believe that kind of thing,
and most people won't admit it.</i>

20
00:01:05,202 --> 00:01:08,548
<i>Midnight is the time when a door opens
from our world into the next,</i>

21
00:01:08,673 --> 00:01:12,173
<i>and we are visited by the dark spirits
of the shadow lands.</i>

22
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,739
<i>The incubus, the succubus,</i>

23
00:01:16,349 --> 00:01:17,429
<i>the old hag.</i>

24
00:01:17,915 --> 00:01:21,539
<i>Visitors are known by many names,
but each story bears the same marks.</i>

25
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:27,508
<i>The demons come after midnight
in the first three hours of the new day</i>

26
00:01:27,633 --> 00:01:29,783
<i>when we are alone and vulnerable,</i>

27
00:01:29,908 --> 00:01:32,685
<i>deep asleep and helpless,
when we cannot move.</i>

28
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:36,804
<i>They lay on us,
press on us, suffocate us.</i>

29
00:01:37,247 --> 00:01:39,013
<i>Take from us what is most precious.</i>

30
00:01:40,548 --> 00:01:42,476
<i>Our lives, our love,</i>

31
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:44,119
<i>our sanity.</i>

32
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,820
<i>Our sleep.</i>

33
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:53,136
<i>If you believe
in that kind of thing.</i>

34
00:02:04,526 --> 00:02:05,726
Where are you?

35
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,384
In an industrial park near downtown.

36
00:02:09,047 --> 00:02:11,589
God, mom, it's almost 12:00.
I was hoping you were asleep.

37
00:02:12,103 --> 00:02:13,653
Well, it didn't take.

38
00:02:14,803 --> 00:02:16,253
<i>What are you doing?</i>

39
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,013
I got a lead off the surveillance tapes
of Charm Acres.

40
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:22,808
And how many hours of people sleeping
did you have to watch?

41
00:02:23,381 --> 00:02:24,599
All of them.

42
00:02:24,724 --> 00:02:26,074
<i>So where are you?</i>

43
00:02:26,668 --> 00:02:28,022
Western Iron and Metal.

44
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:31,484
They supply specialty metal tooling
equipment to desert Heat and Air.

45
00:02:32,504 --> 00:02:34,028
They're connected to Skynet?

46
00:02:34,391 --> 00:02:37,251
You should get on the computer,
find out who owns the place.

47
00:02:37,376 --> 00:02:38,474
<i>I'm on it.</i>

48
00:03:39,434 --> 00:03:41,595
Sarah, you had another nightmare.

49
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,646
I can't stay here anymore.

50
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:46,976
You've only been here one night.

51
00:03:47,145 --> 00:03:48,441
Feels a lot longer.

52
00:03:48,566 --> 00:03:51,058
We don't have enough data
to prescribe a treatment.

53
00:03:51,183 --> 00:03:53,191
The first night
only establishes a baseline.

54
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,508
I'll be fine.

55
00:03:54,633 --> 00:03:57,152
You go home now,
things'll only get worse.

56
00:03:57,934 --> 00:04:01,525
You think two weeks without sleep
is bad? Try two or three years.

57
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:02,880
It happens.

58
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,911
Everyone needs their sleep.

59
00:04:06,265 --> 00:04:07,415
Not everyone.

60
00:04:07,617 --> 00:04:08,688
You do.

61
00:04:10,294 --> 00:04:12,576
I'm gonna get you some coffee.
But I have to warn you,

62
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:14,753
this is a decaf-only facility,
all right?

63
00:04:27,427 --> 00:04:29,810
- Can I help you?
- Who are you?

64
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:32,503
I'm your roommate.
Dana.

65
00:04:34,018 --> 00:04:37,568
- When did you get here?
- Last night while you were asleep.

66
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:41,322
Not really asleep. More like thrashing
and screaming in your bed.

67
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,066
What's with the lighter?

68
00:04:45,357 --> 00:04:47,786
- What lighter?
- The one in your bra.

69
00:04:49,533 --> 00:04:51,333
Trying to give up smoking.

70
00:04:52,436 --> 00:04:55,251
- In a sleep clinic?
- Yeah, I've got sleep problems too.

71
00:04:55,683 --> 00:04:57,949
The doctors think it's related
to my chronic fatigue,

72
00:04:58,074 --> 00:05:00,368
which they believe was caused
by my eating disorder,

73
00:05:00,493 --> 00:05:02,493
which is why I had
the lap band surgery.

74
00:05:02,618 --> 00:05:04,469
You know, the stapling your stomach.

75
00:05:05,397 --> 00:05:08,147
But are the doctors
satisfied with that? No!

76
00:05:10,313 --> 00:05:12,513
They wanna take away all my vices.

77
00:05:13,595 --> 00:05:15,595
Well, that's not gonna happen.

78
00:05:15,853 --> 00:05:18,903
- Girl's gotta sin sometime.
- Hence, the smoking.

79
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:21,995
Yeah, that and the younger men.

80
00:05:24,827 --> 00:05:27,201
- Mom.
- Hey, tiger!

81
00:05:31,154 --> 00:05:34,054
It's visiting time.
Cameron's in the cafeteria.

82
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,711
Do me a favor.
Let's keep this our little secret.

83
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:42,574
There you go.

84
00:05:46,472 --> 00:05:48,223
Scrambled or hard boiled?

85
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,890
Scrambled.

86
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:53,393
You need a carbohydrate that makes up
at least 15% of your daily allowance.

87
00:05:55,475 --> 00:05:57,272
Those won't be as good as yours.

88
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,111
You made pancakes?

89
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:05,099
I added a teaspoon of vanilla
to your recipe.

90
00:06:05,224 --> 00:06:08,353
- I don't have a recipe.
- The recipe on the box.

91
00:06:18,734 --> 00:06:20,234
Not as good as hers?

92
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,214
Not as good as food.

93
00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:25,419
Tomorrow I'll bring you
something real to eat.

94
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,355
- They have anything to say?
- About what?

95
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,130
About what?
About why you're not sleeping.

96
00:06:31,255 --> 00:06:32,558
They figured out why?

97
00:06:32,917 --> 00:06:35,269
Besides the fact
the world's about to end?

98
00:06:36,621 --> 00:06:37,980
You used to sleep well.

99
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:41,191
I shouldn't be here.
I should be at home.

100
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:44,153
We're fine at home.
Everything's fine.

101
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,640
This was a mistake.

102
00:06:48,363 --> 00:06:51,091
No, this...
This is necessary.

103
00:06:53,194 --> 00:06:54,194
Mom...

104
00:06:55,664 --> 00:06:57,207
you're useless like this.

105
00:06:57,837 --> 00:07:01,241
You haven't slept in two weeks.
You fell down the stairs.

106
00:07:01,523 --> 00:07:05,061
If you don't take care of yourself,
something worse might happen.

107
00:07:05,186 --> 00:07:06,836
You need to get better.

108
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,844
I need you to get better.

109
00:07:13,804 --> 00:07:15,054
Don't forget...

110
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,646
You're not her.

111
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,818
Please... get some sleep.

112
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,592
You're dead.

113
00:08:42,691 --> 00:08:43,841
I killed you.

114
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:45,499
And I killed you.

115
00:08:48,907 --> 00:08:51,357
One of us
is gonna have to step it up.

118
00:09:10,428 --> 00:09:11,559
So...

119
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,240
You wanna know who I am?

120
00:09:18,827 --> 00:09:20,621
That's the first thing
most people ask,

121
00:09:20,746 --> 00:09:24,199
first thing that comes out of their
mouths when the gag comes off...

122
00:09:24,324 --> 00:09:27,240
And they keep asking it over
and over again.

123
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:31,059
Psychiatrists say

124
00:09:31,531 --> 00:09:34,231
naming things gives people
power over them.

125
00:09:35,151 --> 00:09:36,575
They're dead wrong on that.

126
00:09:37,813 --> 00:09:39,663
I already know who you are.

127
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,200
Yeah, right.
I forgot.

128
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,655
And...

129
00:09:44,524 --> 00:09:48,128
you found Western Iron and Metal.

130
00:09:53,496 --> 00:09:55,894
Of course,
I never expected anything less

131
00:09:56,019 --> 00:09:58,388
from the girl
that used a cross-dresser

132
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:01,501
and a hypnotherapist to find us.

133
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:05,062
You know, I gotta admit,
I didn't see that one comin'.

134
00:10:06,684 --> 00:10:08,440
You won't see the next one
coming either.

135
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,984
Oh, I beg to differ, ma'am.
I beg to differ.

136
00:10:11,722 --> 00:10:13,273
So who do you work for?

137
00:10:13,827 --> 00:10:14,863
I work alone.

138
00:10:15,721 --> 00:10:19,368
Somebody blew up our factory
while you were getting patched up.

139
00:10:20,615 --> 00:10:22,411
Was that your boyfriend
on the phone?

140
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,092
What are you guys, some kind of a...

141
00:10:25,217 --> 00:10:27,138
Bonnie and Clyde type operation?

142
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,855
I said, was that your Clyde
on the phone?

143
00:10:38,191 --> 00:10:40,097
Why don't you come closer,
and I'll tell you?

144
00:10:40,827 --> 00:10:42,778
So you can bite my face off? No.

145
00:10:42,995 --> 00:10:44,301
I don't think so.

146
00:10:48,071 --> 00:10:49,347
See those seeds?

147
00:10:52,623 --> 00:10:55,529
I go through about a bag
in three hours.

148
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,448
Little habit I picked up
when I quit smoking.

149
00:10:59,836 --> 00:11:03,324
Before I finish that bag,
you're gonna talk.

150
00:11:04,287 --> 00:11:05,661
Special recipe.

151
00:11:08,027 --> 00:11:10,794
It'll have you singin'...
Like Sunday choir.

152
00:11:17,995 --> 00:11:19,386
What's wrong?
Gel too cold?

153
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:22,999
Most people don't like
the electrodes first time.

154
00:11:23,124 --> 00:11:26,489
Makes 'em feel like Frankenstein.
You'll get used to it.

155
00:11:27,157 --> 00:11:29,090
I'm willing to bet you sleep
better tonight.

156
00:11:29,215 --> 00:11:30,647
What's happening to me?

157
00:11:32,174 --> 00:11:33,664
Let me show you something.

158
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:39,541
These are our observation machines.

159
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,295
And this is your chart.

160
00:11:44,397 --> 00:11:47,914
There are 5 stages to the sleep cycle.
The fifth stage is the most active...

161
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:51,084
Increased respiration rate,
blood pressure, brain activity.

162
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:53,628
Rem sleep,
when most dreaming occurs.

163
00:11:54,521 --> 00:11:56,397
It's rare, but sometimes...

164
00:11:56,671 --> 00:11:58,832
night terrors like the ones
you're experiencing can...

165
00:11:58,957 --> 00:12:00,969
I never said I was experiencing
night terrors.

166
00:12:01,195 --> 00:12:02,299
You don't have to.

167
00:12:02,424 --> 00:12:05,207
Your chart tells us
everything we need to know.

168
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:07,309
Night terrors can be caused
by a brain tumor.

169
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:09,728
Cancer.

170
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:11,730
Which, as far as we can tell,
you don't have.

171
00:12:12,153 --> 00:12:14,135
MRI showed your brain was clear.

172
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:18,236
No heart disease,
nocturnal asthma or sleep apnea.

173
00:12:18,895 --> 00:12:21,114
What's wrong with you
is in your head.

174
00:12:21,715 --> 00:12:23,758
And by your head, I mean your mind.

175
00:12:24,593 --> 00:12:26,939
Therapy to reduce anxiety
is part of the usual treatment.

176
00:12:27,064 --> 00:12:29,496
Have you ever...
Seen a therapist?

177
00:12:29,621 --> 00:12:31,482
A lot of people find
talking one-on-one

178
00:12:31,607 --> 00:12:33,830
to be very helpful in breaking down
what's really going on.

179
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,337
Tried it.
Didn't take.

180
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,423
How 'bout a prescription?
Diazepam usually helps.

181
00:12:38,678 --> 00:12:39,716
Don't like drugs.

182
00:12:41,584 --> 00:12:43,043
Speaking of drugs...

183
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:45,388
Has your roommate
been smoking again?

184
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,165
I'm not interested in being
anybody's mother.

185
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,764
I've got two kids of my own,
and that's enough...

186
00:13:01,417 --> 00:13:03,092
Did you know about this?

187
00:13:04,331 --> 00:13:07,536
Besides all the other obvious hazards,
nicotine is a stimulant.

188
00:13:07,848 --> 00:13:10,461
Hits the brain in seven seconds
and adds 20 heartbeats per minute.

189
00:13:10,586 --> 00:13:12,394
I quit smoking years ago.

190
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:14,209
I've got too much
excitement in my life.

191
00:13:15,481 --> 00:13:16,725
Yeah, don't we all?

192
00:13:18,244 --> 00:13:20,671
Well, I have to file
a report on this.

193
00:13:23,081 --> 00:13:25,053
I'll be back later
to attach your electrodes.

194
00:13:42,704 --> 00:13:44,249
It's a dream catcher.

195
00:13:44,374 --> 00:13:46,316
It's supposed to catch nightmares.

196
00:13:46,805 --> 00:13:48,118
Hector made me one too.

197
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,721
- Hector?
- The cleaning guy.

198
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:54,249
You know, Papi Chulo
with the neck tattoo?

199
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:57,210
You look tired.

200
00:13:58,491 --> 00:14:00,171
You should take that
as a compliment.

201
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,925
I ran into nurse Ratched
in the hallway.

202
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,305
She smacked my bum for the cigarette
and gave me some sleeping pills.

203
00:14:11,704 --> 00:14:12,704
The good stuff.

204
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,037
So... what about you?

205
00:14:16,578 --> 00:14:18,815
Drowning, being chased,
teeth falling out?

206
00:14:19,054 --> 00:14:21,026
Being chased
should probably cover it.

207
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:24,610
You're running away from something
you don't want to deal with.

208
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,580
At least that's
what they say, anyway.

209
00:14:28,254 --> 00:14:29,254
And you?

210
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,353
I burn alive.

211
00:14:31,478 --> 00:14:33,831
Yeah, my whole body
just catches fire.

212
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,208
I try and I try.
I can't put myself out.

213
00:14:36,657 --> 00:14:38,251
Anxiety about quitting smoking.

214
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:41,149
Yeah, that... or I was
a witch in another life.

215
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:45,751
They say if you die in your dreams,
you die in real life.

216
00:14:48,032 --> 00:14:49,983
Oh, I've died a thousand times.

217
00:14:51,341 --> 00:14:52,994
Never gets any easier.

218
00:14:54,981 --> 00:14:58,896
Of all the nightmares it's caught,
surprisingly it hasn't spilled them out.

219
00:15:01,941 --> 00:15:03,735
Do the bad guys ever catch you?

220
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:29,917
That's a...
Quite a collection.

221
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:33,767
Bullet wounds, stabbings.

222
00:15:37,898 --> 00:15:39,271
Emergency C-section.

223
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:48,771
But that's plenty old,
that last one.

224
00:15:50,248 --> 00:15:53,743
Your child must be...
15, maybe 20 by now?

225
00:15:57,641 --> 00:15:59,091
They'll kill you...

226
00:15:59,896 --> 00:16:01,667
Just like they killed everyone else.

227
00:16:02,483 --> 00:16:04,921
- They?
- Your bosses, Kaliba.

228
00:16:07,203 --> 00:16:08,503
They blew up your factory,

229
00:16:09,381 --> 00:16:10,969
killed 30 of their own people.

230
00:16:11,407 --> 00:16:12,887
Lady, you're insane.

231
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,759
Why would anyone
blow up their own factory?

232
00:16:17,202 --> 00:16:20,020
- To hide what you were building.
- And what was that?

233
00:16:21,128 --> 00:16:22,128
The end.

234
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:26,151
You are very...
dramatic.

235
00:16:31,317 --> 00:16:32,516
Diana...

236
00:16:35,391 --> 00:16:36,702
thought you were a good man.

237
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,000
What do you think she'd say
if she saw you now?

238
00:16:46,141 --> 00:16:47,141
You...

239
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,082
You leave my wife out of this...

240
00:16:52,046 --> 00:16:54,597
You crazy... bitch.

241
00:17:50,421 --> 00:17:51,451
Dana?

242
00:17:53,641 --> 00:17:54,963
Dana, wake up.

243
00:17:57,466 --> 00:17:58,772
Dana, wake up.

244
00:19:49,007 --> 00:19:52,088
Your electrodes came off last night.
Did you take them off?

245
00:19:53,668 --> 00:19:54,818
I don't remember.

246
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,278
Are you a sleepwalker?

247
00:19:58,326 --> 00:20:00,154
It's happened once or twice.

248
00:20:00,871 --> 00:20:03,059
You didn't mention that
in your intake.

249
00:20:03,184 --> 00:20:05,036
Must have slipped my mind.
I'm sorry.

250
00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:07,872
So you don't remember
getting out of bed last night.

251
00:20:11,118 --> 00:20:12,918
I don't remember anything.

252
00:20:23,684 --> 00:20:25,872
Salvador Dali
often explored the subconscious

253
00:20:25,997 --> 00:20:28,047
in the dream world in his work.

254
00:20:29,556 --> 00:20:31,604
Are your dreams like this painting?

255
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:37,033
Everyone's dreams are different.

256
00:20:37,338 --> 00:20:39,362
Guess it depends
on what's stuck in your head.

257
00:20:47,642 --> 00:20:48,642
Come on!

258
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,331
What's it like to dream?

259
00:20:56,243 --> 00:20:59,093
It's sort of like
you're in a play or a movie.

260
00:20:59,929 --> 00:21:02,844
It looks real and it feels real...

261
00:21:04,308 --> 00:21:06,308
How do you know it's not real?

262
00:21:06,668 --> 00:21:07,849
Sometimes you don't.

263
00:21:19,429 --> 00:21:20,579
Be careful...

264
00:21:26,139 --> 00:21:27,389
Yes, thank you.

265
00:21:32,682 --> 00:21:33,666
What's wrong?

266
00:21:43,122 --> 00:21:44,886
Something strange is going on here.

267
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:46,845
Like what?

268
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:49,632
I woke up last night
and saw the nurse

269
00:21:49,987 --> 00:21:51,787
giving my roommate a shot.

270
00:21:54,496 --> 00:21:56,495
Okay, well, it's a medical clinic.

271
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,570
So what's strange about that?

272
00:21:59,245 --> 00:22:02,737
She was passed out.
She had already taken sleeping pills.

273
00:22:04,745 --> 00:22:07,157
So... you think the nurse is...

274
00:22:08,372 --> 00:22:10,078
What, like the angel of death?

275
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:13,665
After she gave her the shot, she went
downstairs to a room in the basement.

276
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,387
Well, she looks all right.

277
00:22:27,873 --> 00:22:28,873
She's not.

278
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,120
No one is.

279
00:22:35,911 --> 00:22:36,911
Mom...

280
00:22:38,347 --> 00:22:41,252
- Did you sleep last night?
- You think I'm making this up?

281
00:22:41,623 --> 00:22:43,684
No. I don't think
you're making this up.

282
00:22:43,809 --> 00:22:44,909
It's just...

283
00:22:47,034 --> 00:22:47,991
You're a mess.

284
00:22:48,185 --> 00:22:49,888
You don't be fooled, John.

285
00:22:50,874 --> 00:22:53,024
Don't be fooled by anyone's face.

286
00:22:54,809 --> 00:22:57,125
You don't know
what's behind anyone's face.

287
00:22:58,645 --> 00:23:00,503
You talking about
the guy at the factory?

288
00:23:04,684 --> 00:23:07,721
The one who shot you?
The one you shot?

289
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:10,308
We don't talk about that.

290
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,359
- We can talk about anything.
- No, we can't.

291
00:23:15,657 --> 00:23:17,228
Is he the one in your nightmares?

292
00:23:21,318 --> 00:23:22,498
It's always the same.

293
00:23:22,623 --> 00:23:24,944
He comes out of nowhere.
He grabs me.

294
00:23:27,748 --> 00:23:29,198
Takes me hostage in a van.

295
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:35,771
What does he want?

296
00:23:37,808 --> 00:23:39,623
To know who I am,
who I'm working with.

297
00:23:39,748 --> 00:23:42,439
He has me tied up, drugged.

298
00:23:43,921 --> 00:23:45,089
He isn't real.

299
00:23:46,122 --> 00:23:47,922
He can't hurt you anymore.

300
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:49,670
He's in my head.

301
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:52,305
I can't get him out.

302
00:23:53,619 --> 00:23:54,619
Look at me.

303
00:23:57,497 --> 00:23:59,228
You did what you had to do.

304
00:23:59,684 --> 00:24:01,284
You defended yourself.

305
00:24:04,935 --> 00:24:07,377
I'm not supposed to defend myself.

306
00:24:08,807 --> 00:24:10,657
I'm supposed to defend you.

307
00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:12,869
Nap time.

308
00:24:15,147 --> 00:24:17,026
Don't worry.
We'll get her to close her eyes.

309
00:24:17,151 --> 00:24:18,183
Come on.

310
00:24:41,121 --> 00:24:42,121
My wife...

311
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,446
What was she wearing...
at my funeral?

312
00:24:46,994 --> 00:24:47,994
Black.

313
00:24:49,114 --> 00:24:50,114
Hair...

314
00:24:51,518 --> 00:24:52,831
Down or back?

315
00:24:53,369 --> 00:24:55,219
Down, and earrings, pearls.

316
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,496
I bought those for her birthday.

317
00:24:58,665 --> 00:25:00,164
Your salary must be good.

318
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,501
It's the best part of the job.

319
00:25:04,184 --> 00:25:05,294
And the worst?

320
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:09,019
You saw the tapes.

321
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:11,234
So you know.

322
00:25:16,744 --> 00:25:18,224
First one was the hardest.

323
00:25:18,998 --> 00:25:19,998
Frank?

324
00:25:21,576 --> 00:25:23,855
Your neighbor.
His son played lacrosse.

325
00:25:24,806 --> 00:25:26,656
He borrowed my lawnmower...

326
00:25:27,432 --> 00:25:28,582
every Friday.

327
00:25:31,621 --> 00:25:33,371
He never cleaned the bag.

328
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,070
Why would they want him dead?

329
00:25:36,806 --> 00:25:38,206
He kept the books.

330
00:25:38,903 --> 00:25:40,705
Handled the overseas business.

331
00:25:42,557 --> 00:25:43,807
He was a drunk.

332
00:25:44,104 --> 00:25:46,169
Overseas.
So your bosses are foreign.

333
00:25:47,448 --> 00:25:49,806
They fixed me up after you shot me.

334
00:25:51,055 --> 00:25:52,905
Put me in a private clinic.

335
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:56,430
And I thought
it was because they were...

336
00:25:56,808 --> 00:25:57,808
being kind.

337
00:25:57,998 --> 00:25:59,398
Then I realized...

338
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:02,810
they were just patching me up
so I could do my job.

339
00:26:03,308 --> 00:26:04,562
What's your job?

340
00:26:06,069 --> 00:26:07,269
Like I said...

341
00:26:08,682 --> 00:26:10,318
First one was the hardest.

342
00:26:12,495 --> 00:26:13,738
You were my first.

343
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:17,820
You seem surprised.

344
00:26:18,434 --> 00:26:19,434
I just...

345
00:26:20,619 --> 00:26:22,859
I just figured a badass gal
like yourself...

346
00:26:22,984 --> 00:26:23,984
Never.

347
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:29,919
I'm... glad I didn't
break your streak.

348
00:26:35,309 --> 00:26:37,470
I can help you disappear,
you and your wife.

349
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:42,664
They'll hunt us down.
They'll slaughter us.

350
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,519
There are ways to keep 'em
off your trail, things I've learned.

351
00:26:47,955 --> 00:26:48,814
Like what?

352
00:26:48,983 --> 00:26:51,183
You ditch the van.
Get a new car.

353
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,904
Check into an expensive hotel,
the most expensive you can find.

354
00:26:55,073 --> 00:26:58,323
They'll always expect the opposite.
You have my phone.

355
00:26:59,495 --> 00:27:01,911
When I get back to my people,
I'll call you.

356
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:05,623
But we have to move fast
so they don't know what's happening.

357
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,120
Her smell.

358
00:27:16,157 --> 00:27:17,510
It's what I miss the most.

359
00:27:18,135 --> 00:27:19,585
Like clean laundry.

360
00:27:58,368 --> 00:28:00,518
Didn't see that one comin'... hmm?

361
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:12,620
Get out of the room.

362
00:28:15,184 --> 00:28:16,610
She's in there!

363
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,654
- Get her out of the room!
- She's in there!

364
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:29,300
Remember I told you
something strange was going on?

365
00:28:35,761 --> 00:28:37,048
The nurse.

366
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:38,341
My roommate's dead.

367
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,843
<i>She died last night in a fire.</i>

368
00:28:41,012 --> 00:28:42,887
They claim
it's some kind of accident.

369
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:45,264
Maybe you're right.
Maybe you should come home.

370
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:46,532
No, not now.

371
00:28:53,199 --> 00:28:56,323
I'd like to give you an update
on Dana's condition.

372
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:59,403
There's a rumor going around the clinic
that she didn't pull through.

373
00:29:00,154 --> 00:29:01,381
That's not the case.

374
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:05,256
Dana is in extremely critical condition,
but she is still alive.

375
00:29:05,889 --> 00:29:08,989
This has been a traumatic
experience for all of us.

376
00:29:09,805 --> 00:29:11,904
Patients, if you choose
to leave the clinic,

377
00:29:12,029 --> 00:29:14,627
you may return at any time
to complete your treatment.

378
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:15,626
However,

379
00:29:15,751 --> 00:29:18,395
it would be of great value to us,
and we think to you,

380
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:22,093
if we could evaluate your sleep patterns
during this time of duress.

381
00:29:22,496 --> 00:29:25,646
Whatever you choose,
we fully support your decision.

382
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:32,450
Miss Baum.

383
00:29:33,885 --> 00:29:35,885
I hear you've decided to stay.

384
00:29:36,638 --> 00:29:37,638
I have.

385
00:29:37,853 --> 00:29:39,945
An incident like this
increases cortisol levels.

386
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:42,321
You may find it even more
difficult to sleep tonight.

387
00:29:42,748 --> 00:29:43,572
Here.

388
00:29:45,133 --> 00:29:46,450
These should help.

389
00:29:47,917 --> 00:29:48,950
Diazepam.

390
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:51,163
Like I said, standard
treatment for insomnia.

391
00:29:53,199 --> 00:29:54,875
You should take them now.

392
00:30:06,255 --> 00:30:07,255
Good.

393
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,452
I've been meaning to say thank you.

394
00:30:31,315 --> 00:30:32,815
For the dream catcher.

395
00:30:34,205 --> 00:30:35,791
You make them for all the patients?

396
00:30:36,345 --> 00:30:37,751
Just the ones who need 'em.

397
00:30:38,245 --> 00:30:40,045
The ones who have nightmares.

398
00:30:42,905 --> 00:30:44,365
Did you know her well?

399
00:30:45,185 --> 00:30:46,510
You know, she ain't dead.

400
00:30:46,855 --> 00:30:48,005
Right. Sorry.

401
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:53,684
She kept saying she dreamt
she died in a fire.

402
00:30:55,985 --> 00:30:58,105
Maybe I shoulda made her
a bigger one, huh?

403
00:30:58,375 --> 00:31:00,441
A nightmare didn't burn her.
A cigarette did.

404
00:31:02,615 --> 00:31:04,265
She shoulda taken charge.

405
00:31:05,415 --> 00:31:06,489
Taken charge?

406
00:31:06,735 --> 00:31:08,324
Of what was goin' on
inside her head.

407
00:31:08,875 --> 00:31:10,025
Controlled it.

408
00:31:10,655 --> 00:31:12,705
- You believe it then?
- Of course I do.

409
00:31:21,765 --> 00:31:24,465
Coyote. Does it have
mystical significance?

410
00:31:25,215 --> 00:31:27,426
Does it protect you,
guide you?

411
00:31:27,855 --> 00:31:29,265
This?
No.

412
00:31:30,505 --> 00:31:32,005
It's just for my girl.

413
00:31:32,545 --> 00:31:33,766
She thinks it's sexy.

414
00:31:45,045 --> 00:31:47,363
- Tell me a story.
- Go to hell.

415
00:31:50,175 --> 00:31:52,815
What most people know
about torture's bullcrap.

416
00:31:53,275 --> 00:31:56,675
It's not the pain causes people to talk.
It's the talking causes people pain.

417
00:31:59,075 --> 00:32:00,765
So tell me a story.

418
00:32:01,325 --> 00:32:03,320
You told me a story once
in the warehouse,

419
00:32:03,445 --> 00:32:04,805
a story about your son.

420
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,395
That's when you let me go.

421
00:32:10,725 --> 00:32:12,675
Thinking back on it, it's funny.

422
00:32:13,115 --> 00:32:14,950
You don't strike me
as the sentimental type.

423
00:32:15,075 --> 00:32:16,525
Your story, not mine.

424
00:32:17,925 --> 00:32:19,605
Yeah, but you believed it.

425
00:32:22,965 --> 00:32:24,285
You believed it...

426
00:32:25,435 --> 00:32:27,075
because you have a child.

427
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:29,905
I've seen your scar.

428
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:36,665
My story is your story.

429
00:32:37,825 --> 00:32:39,880
That's why you told it back to me
when I asked you.

430
00:32:40,005 --> 00:32:41,775
This is what is important.

431
00:32:43,925 --> 00:32:45,765
This is who you're protecting.

432
00:32:48,615 --> 00:32:49,795
You have a son.

433
00:32:52,265 --> 00:32:53,387
He's your accomplice.

434
00:32:59,565 --> 00:33:00,465
See?

435
00:33:02,095 --> 00:33:03,473
That wasn't so hard.

436
00:33:35,225 --> 00:33:37,665
So your son...
is your accomplice.

437
00:33:39,035 --> 00:33:41,595
You're not Bonnie.
You're Ma Barker.

438
00:33:42,785 --> 00:33:45,564
- He's just a boy.
- A boy you'd die to protect.

439
00:33:46,325 --> 00:33:47,675
Any mother would.

440
00:33:49,025 --> 00:33:50,235
You'd be surprised.

441
00:33:51,925 --> 00:33:53,515
The enemy's like a weed.

442
00:33:54,335 --> 00:33:57,707
Leave any part of it underground, it'll
pop right back up when least expected.

443
00:33:59,405 --> 00:34:01,005
You gotta kill the root.

444
00:34:02,645 --> 00:34:03,965
Or in this case...

445
00:34:05,305 --> 00:34:06,305
the seed.

446
00:34:07,675 --> 00:34:09,390
You won't get anywhere near him.

447
00:34:09,515 --> 00:34:10,744
He's not alone.

448
00:34:10,869 --> 00:34:12,132
I won't have to.

449
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,700
You're his mother.

450
00:34:18,345 --> 00:34:19,565
He'll come to you.

451
00:34:19,755 --> 00:34:21,535
He won't come anywhere near here.

452
00:34:21,825 --> 00:34:23,102
He knows better.

453
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:24,170
He will.

454
00:34:28,095 --> 00:34:29,915
He will when you ask him.

455
00:34:46,605 --> 00:34:48,293
We don't need to talk anymore.

456
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:54,065
I won't call him.

457
00:34:55,765 --> 00:34:56,802
I'll die first.

458
00:34:57,795 --> 00:34:59,595
You'd like that... to die.

459
00:35:01,515 --> 00:35:03,058
But it's never that easy, is it?

460
00:35:06,345 --> 00:35:07,479
Hey, wake up.

461
00:35:08,145 --> 00:35:09,895
You okay?
You called me.

462
00:35:10,395 --> 00:35:12,401
The nurse. She gave me a shot.

463
00:35:15,025 --> 00:35:16,405
Some kind of sedative.

464
00:35:16,805 --> 00:35:18,355
Let's get outta here.

465
00:35:19,745 --> 00:35:21,285
She's gonna keep hurting people.

466
00:35:23,075 --> 00:35:24,595
We have to do something.

467
00:35:41,175 --> 00:35:43,275
Think you can hack the combination?

468
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:44,895
In my sleep.

469
00:36:06,425 --> 00:36:07,998
It's some kind of scanning program.

470
00:36:10,955 --> 00:36:12,586
It's neural activity, brain scans.

471
00:36:20,415 --> 00:36:23,013
- There's files, thousands of them.
- Am I in there?

472
00:36:24,465 --> 00:36:26,058
I don't know.
It's by patient number.

473
00:36:39,595 --> 00:36:42,449
All right, there's a ton of data on you.
It's a whole profile.

474
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:43,784
Delete it.
All of it.

475
00:36:45,915 --> 00:36:48,497
This is a Skynet experiment, John.
They're stealing everything.

476
00:36:50,085 --> 00:36:52,200
- Mom...
- Sleep is the perfect cover.

477
00:36:52,325 --> 00:36:54,378
Brain's still active,
but you don't remember a thing.

478
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:57,339
- They run a sleep clinic.
- They're not people. You get rid of it?

479
00:37:04,995 --> 00:37:08,065
Nurse Hobson?
There's a problem in room 22. No data.

480
00:37:08,485 --> 00:37:10,670
Miss Baum's electrodes
must have slipped off again.

481
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:12,395
Thank you for explaining.

482
00:37:16,595 --> 00:37:18,819
- Is that everything?
- Almost.

483
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:20,654
- I don't want a trace left.
- I know.

484
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:22,380
All of it, John.
Get rid of it.

485
00:37:22,505 --> 00:37:24,283
I don't want any of me
left in there.

486
00:37:25,575 --> 00:37:29,075
All right, it's gone.
It's all gone, okay? You're all gone.

487
00:37:30,245 --> 00:37:32,605
Whatever she gave me
is starting to hit.

488
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:50,017
This is a restricted area.
How did you get in here?

489
00:37:51,445 --> 00:37:53,520
I don't know.
I must have been sleepwalking.

490
00:37:54,595 --> 00:37:55,814
Through a locked door?

491
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:58,150
Sorry.

492
00:38:03,395 --> 00:38:04,948
I'll go back to my room.

493
00:38:06,715 --> 00:38:07,965
Did you know...

494
00:38:08,585 --> 00:38:11,490
that when a human falls in love,
the same areas of the brain light up

495
00:38:11,615 --> 00:38:13,665
as when a human is intoxicated?

496
00:38:15,495 --> 00:38:17,735
What does that have to do
with my nightmares?

497
00:38:18,005 --> 00:38:19,355
We don't know yet.

498
00:38:19,885 --> 00:38:22,758
We don't fully understand
why humans need to dream.

499
00:38:25,145 --> 00:38:26,345
Humans like you?

500
00:38:29,715 --> 00:38:30,849
You drugged me.

501
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:34,045
What you're experiencing
is sleep paralysis.

502
00:38:34,915 --> 00:38:36,605
You want to move, but you can't.

503
00:38:44,765 --> 00:38:45,864
Believe it or not,

504
00:38:46,465 --> 00:38:48,951
your body is actually
protecting you right now.

505
00:38:50,525 --> 00:38:53,372
You were talking to someone
when I entered the room. Your boy.

506
00:38:53,965 --> 00:38:55,415
The one who came to visit.

507
00:38:56,435 --> 00:38:57,535
Call to him.

508
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:01,588
I'd die first.

509
00:39:03,845 --> 00:39:05,365
I'm sure you'd like that...

510
00:39:05,565 --> 00:39:06,465
to die.

511
00:39:11,905 --> 00:39:13,100
It's never that easy.

512
00:39:23,545 --> 00:39:24,995
What is this thing?

513
00:39:26,785 --> 00:39:27,685
Mom.

514
00:39:30,485 --> 00:39:31,410
What are you?

515
00:40:09,095 --> 00:40:10,245
It's her son.

516
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,409
He helped her blow up the facility.

517
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:14,835
He's the one we want.

518
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:21,918
We'll give him a few more hours
to show up.

519
00:40:22,745 --> 00:40:23,745
I don't know.

520
00:40:24,135 --> 00:40:25,088
Maybe three.

521
00:40:33,135 --> 00:40:35,135
She gave me a few problems.

522
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,935
Nothing I couldn't handle.

523
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:43,565
Yeah, I guess
we don't need her anymore.

524
00:40:50,235 --> 00:40:52,620
You can trace her cell phone
to this location without her alive.

525
00:40:52,745 --> 00:40:54,545
Makes no difference to me.

526
00:40:56,235 --> 00:40:57,685
It's not a problem.

527
00:40:57,995 --> 00:41:00,045
I'll take care of it right now.

528
00:41:02,645 --> 00:41:03,645
Hell...

529
00:41:04,035 --> 00:41:05,462
It's what she wants.

530
00:42:01,744 --> 00:42:02,644
You're real.

531
