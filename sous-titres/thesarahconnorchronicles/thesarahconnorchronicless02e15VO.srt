00:00:01,834 --> 00:00:03,033
<i>Previously on terminator:
the sarah connor chronicles...</i>

2
00:00:03,034 --> 00:00:04,034
where's the metal?

3
00:00:06,533 --> 00:00:07,532
Who are you?

4
00:00:07,533 --> 00:00:08,634
My name's winston.

5
00:00:10,667 --> 00:00:11,833
I talked to your mom.

6
00:00:11,834 --> 00:00:13,233
She found something
out in the desert.

7
00:00:13,234 --> 00:00:14,866
It sounds like it has something
to do with those three dots

8
00:00:14,867 --> 00:00:15,866
she's been after.

9
00:00:15,867 --> 00:00:17,933
Is it real this time?

10
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:20,133
Well, the bullet in her leg
sounds real.

11
00:00:20,134 --> 00:00:22,000
You stay.
I'll go.

12
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:23,532
You made your call.

13
00:00:23,533 --> 00:00:25,333
This is what living
with it means.

14
00:00:25,334 --> 00:00:26,833
I detected
this audio transmission

15
00:00:26,834 --> 00:00:28,133
on an unsecured line.

16
00:00:28,134 --> 00:00:29,233
<i>
Got a breach.</i>

17
00:00:29,234 --> 00:00:31,666
<i>Man shot out at heat and air.</i>

18
00:00:31,667 --> 00:00:32,967
<i>Well, you know the drill.
Shut the place down.</i>

19
00:00:57,734 --> 00:01:00,166
<i>
Authorities are still trying
to determine</i>

20
00:01:00,167 --> 00:01:01,333
<i>the cause of the blast</i>

21
00:01:01,334 --> 00:01:03,166
<i>which killed all 32 employees</i>

22
00:01:03,167 --> 00:01:05,033
<i>of the desert canyon
heat and air plant</i>

23
00:01:05,034 --> 00:01:06,599
<i>earlier this week.</i>

24
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,399
<i>A vigil is scheduled
for today</i>

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,566
<i>in charm acres...
the high-desert enclave</i>

26
00:01:09,567 --> 00:01:10,733
<i>that served
as a company town</i>

27
00:01:10,734 --> 00:01:13,066
<i>for the workers
and their families.</i>

28
00:01:13,067 --> 00:01:15,599
<i>Area schools and many
of the town's local businesses</i>

29
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,134
<i>will be closed
in observance... </i>

30
00:01:38,201 --> 00:01:41,699
native americans believe that
when their pictures are taken,

31
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,766
their souls are stolen

32
00:01:42,767 --> 00:01:45,466
and locked
in the photograph forever.

33
00:01:45,467 --> 00:01:47,201
I think you're safe.

34
00:01:48,967 --> 00:01:51,300
God, i hate funerals.

35
00:01:51,301 --> 00:01:53,133
I hate skynet.

36
00:01:53,134 --> 00:01:54,466
How come
this sounded so easy

37
00:01:54,467 --> 00:01:56,133
when we were talking about it
on the way up here?

38
00:01:56,134 --> 00:01:58,300
And now that i see
all these people...

39
00:01:58,301 --> 00:02:01,733
just find somebody
to talk to, john.

40
00:02:01,734 --> 00:02:03,399
Mom, everybody who knew
anything about the factory

41
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,432
is already dead.

42
00:02:04,433 --> 00:02:05,633
Well, i'm not.

43
00:02:05,634 --> 00:02:07,333
Yeah, well,
i guess you're lucky.

44
00:02:07,334 --> 00:02:09,399
I'd feel luckier
if we could find somebody here

45
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,368
who knew what was going on
out there.

46
00:02:38,334 --> 00:02:41,432
You'd never guess
he had it in him.

47
00:02:41,433 --> 00:02:43,267
No.

48
00:02:43,268 --> 00:02:45,034
I see it.

49
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:59,133
That seat taken?

50
00:02:59,134 --> 00:03:02,733
Are you gonna say
annoying things?

51
00:03:02,734 --> 00:03:04,233
Annoying things?

52
00:03:04,234 --> 00:03:05,566
"I can't believe
it's happening."

53
00:03:05,567 --> 00:03:07,901
"It comes in waves."
"I just feel numb."

54
00:03:09,734 --> 00:03:12,667
No, i will, uh, try not
to say those things.

55
00:03:14,567 --> 00:03:15,600
I'm john.

56
00:03:17,234 --> 00:03:18,500
Zoe.

57
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,934
Yeah.

58
00:03:27,268 --> 00:03:30,499
So you know somebody
in charm acres, john?

59
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,034
Or are you just a sucker
for a small-town, homey vigil?

60
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,933
My mom, uh, worked
at the factory.

61
00:03:37,934 --> 00:03:40,100
So she, uh...

62
00:03:40,101 --> 00:03:41,866
you know, came to pay
her respects.

63
00:03:41,867 --> 00:03:44,766
So you got
dragged along.

64
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:48,267
Little drag,
also some push.

65
00:03:48,268 --> 00:03:50,267
It seemed like
the right thing to do.

66
00:03:50,268 --> 00:03:52,599
A stupid thing to do,
if you had a choice.

67
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,200
Did you have
a choice?

68
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:56,599
Funeral crasher.

69
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,067
Stupid funeral crasher.

70
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,100
Am i crazy,

71
00:04:06,101 --> 00:04:09,799
or is that girl
creepily staring at us?

72
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,901
That would be
my sister.

73
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,900
I don't like that.

74
00:04:15,901 --> 00:04:18,334
Uh, no,
no reason to.

75
00:04:20,934 --> 00:04:24,034
That's my mom.

76
00:04:25,967 --> 00:04:28,067
My dad worked
at the factory.

77
00:04:30,567 --> 00:04:31,633
Sorry.

78
00:04:31,634 --> 00:04:33,267
I picked out a suit
this morning,

79
00:04:33,268 --> 00:04:35,432
you know,
to bury him in.

80
00:04:35,433 --> 00:04:37,100
I picked out a gray one,
even though henry said

81
00:04:37,101 --> 00:04:38,432
i should've picked out
a black one.

82
00:04:38,433 --> 00:04:39,600
He looked better
in gray, though.

83
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:45,667
Speak of the henry devil.

84
00:04:48,433 --> 00:04:51,966
We're about to do
the candle lighting.

85
00:04:51,967 --> 00:04:53,667
Hi, i'm john.

86
00:05:03,201 --> 00:05:04,532
Is that
your boyfriend?

87
00:05:04,533 --> 00:05:06,399
You know, he keeps applying
for the job.

88
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,634
I'm just not hiring.

89
00:05:10,201 --> 00:05:13,233
It was nice
to meet you...

90
00:05:13,234 --> 00:05:15,734
john.

91
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,666
Do not stand
at my grave and weep.

92
00:05:23,667 --> 00:05:25,900
I am not there.

93
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:28,900
I do not sleep.

94
00:05:28,901 --> 00:05:31,000
I am a thousand winds
that blow.

95
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:35,866
<i>I am the diamond glint
on snow.</i>

96
00:05:35,867 --> 00:05:39,034
<i>I am the sunlight
on ripened grain.</i>

97
00:05:40,934 --> 00:05:44,766
<i>I am the gentle
autumn rain.</i>

98
00:05:44,767 --> 00:05:47,666
<i>When you awake
in the morning's hush...</i>

99
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:50,267
<i>
i am the swift uplifting rush</i>

100
00:05:50,268 --> 00:05:53,700
<i>of quiet birds
in circled flight.</i>

101
00:05:55,533 --> 00:05:58,933
<i>Do not stand
at my grave and cry.</i>

102
00:05:58,934 --> 00:06:00,532
<i>I am not there.</i>

103
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:03,101
<i>I did not die.</i>

104
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,800
Excuse me.

105
00:06:12,201 --> 00:06:15,033
He hated having
his picture taken.

106
00:06:15,034 --> 00:06:17,233
You wouldn't know it
by looking at him there,

107
00:06:17,234 --> 00:06:18,567
but he did.

108
00:06:20,067 --> 00:06:21,367
Excuse me,
i'll leave...

109
00:06:21,368 --> 00:06:23,532
no, no, no.
It's... it's okay.

110
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:27,368
It's actually refreshing
to see an unfamiliar face.

111
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:34,066
Everybody here... all i see are
the people that they've lost.

112
00:06:34,067 --> 00:06:36,101
All i see
is what's missing.

113
00:06:38,901 --> 00:06:40,166
I'm sarah.

114
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:43,866
Diana winston.

115
00:06:43,867 --> 00:06:46,134
So did you know
my husband, sarah?

116
00:07:20,767 --> 00:07:24,366
Gene used to project

117
00:07:24,367 --> 00:07:27,599
old movies
on his garage door.

118
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,699
Every saturday night
during the summer,

119
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,266
there'd be couples
out in the driveway

120
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:32,966
with their beers
and popcorn...

121
00:07:32,967 --> 00:07:36,266
<i>watching casablanca
or out of the past</i>

122
00:07:36,267 --> 00:07:38,066
<i>or his girl friday.</i>

123
00:07:38,067 --> 00:07:42,467
I just went
for the free beer.

124
00:07:42,468 --> 00:07:46,033
I've been to a lot
of places for that.

125
00:07:46,034 --> 00:07:48,799
I can't remember...

126
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,366
the last movie
that ed and i saw together...

127
00:07:51,367 --> 00:07:53,567
<i>or when.</i>

128
00:07:53,568 --> 00:07:55,899
<i>I used to just leave
his dinner in the fridge</i>

129
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,334
<i>for whenever
he came home.</i>

130
00:07:58,401 --> 00:07:59,733
It wasn't the easiest place
to work.

131
00:08:02,234 --> 00:08:03,632
I was only there
for a few months,

132
00:08:03,633 --> 00:08:06,567
but long enough
to figure that out.

133
00:08:06,568 --> 00:08:09,567
I can't tell you
how many times i wanted to...

134
00:08:09,568 --> 00:08:11,599
make a call or write a letter
to those people

135
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,266
and ask them what kind
of security they had ed doing

136
00:08:14,267 --> 00:08:16,233
that kept him out of the house
seven days a week.

137
00:08:16,234 --> 00:08:19,500
But you never do that.

138
00:08:19,501 --> 00:08:20,866
No one does that.

139
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:22,501
Not here.

140
00:08:33,934 --> 00:08:34,999
Yes, ma'am.

141
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,933
Do you have him,
mr. Walsh?

142
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:38,033
<i>No, ma'am.</i>

143
00:08:38,034 --> 00:08:39,766
He's proven a...

144
00:08:39,767 --> 00:08:42,533
bit harder to locate
than i had anticipated.

145
00:08:42,534 --> 00:08:44,632
You assured me
it'd be a very simple job.

146
00:08:44,633 --> 00:08:45,966
<i>I know, ma'am.</i>

147
00:08:45,967 --> 00:08:48,632
Everyone i've spoken to
thinks that he's dead,

148
00:08:48,633 --> 00:08:50,567
died in the explosion
at the factory.

149
00:08:50,568 --> 00:08:51,966
<i>I can tell you
he isn't.</i>

150
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,400
He didn't.

151
00:08:53,401 --> 00:08:55,567
<i>I've got a good lead
on him, ma'am.</i>

152
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:58,234
I hope so, mr. Walsh.

153
00:09:23,633 --> 00:09:26,732
I must've missed the memo
about wearing plaid today.

154
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,233
Oh, yeah.

155
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,433
Don't worry.
It's not a company policy.

156
00:09:30,434 --> 00:09:31,799
It's just something
a few of us do.

157
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,100
Paying homage,
you know?

158
00:09:34,101 --> 00:09:35,400
To whom?

159
00:09:35,401 --> 00:09:37,933
Weaver, lachlan weaver.

160
00:09:37,934 --> 00:09:39,999
Today's the anniversary
of his death.

161
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,500
Did you know him?

162
00:09:41,501 --> 00:09:42,933
Yeah, he was...

163
00:09:42,934 --> 00:09:44,433
he was a great guy.

164
00:09:44,434 --> 00:09:47,033
You know, he's a genius,
funny as hell.

165
00:09:47,034 --> 00:09:49,266
<i>They both were,
you know,</i>

166
00:09:49,267 --> 00:09:50,767
back then.

167
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:56,467
Good morning,
mr. Ellison.

168
00:09:56,468 --> 00:09:58,799
Mr. Murch.

169
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,632
Ms. Weaver.

170
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,900
Beautiful day,
isn't it?

171
00:10:06,101 --> 00:10:09,333
I'm going to say a few words
about my friend gene miller.

172
00:10:09,334 --> 00:10:11,266
<i>But before i do, i want to take
this opportunity</i>

173
00:10:11,267 --> 00:10:13,933
to thank everyone

174
00:10:13,934 --> 00:10:16,333
<i>at desert heat and air's
parent company,</i>

175
00:10:16,334 --> 00:10:17,799
<i>the kaliba group,</i>

176
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,400
<i>for their generous donations
to this service,</i>

177
00:10:20,401 --> 00:10:22,599
and not just
for the beautiful flowers

178
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,999
you see around our chapel,

179
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,599
<i>but also for the generosity
and kindness they've extended</i>

180
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,000
<i>to the families
in this very difficult time.</i>

181
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,200
Is this all it costs
to buy us?

182
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:37,500
Flowers
and a few kind words?

183
00:10:37,501 --> 00:10:41,100
<i>Where's anybody
from the company?</i>

184
00:10:41,101 --> 00:10:44,033
<i>Have any of you seen anybody
from the company?</i>

185
00:10:44,034 --> 00:10:46,234
<i>Has anybody ever seen anybody
from the company?</i>

186
00:10:47,834 --> 00:10:49,200
<i>No.</i>

187
00:10:49,201 --> 00:10:50,800
You have not.

188
00:10:55,201 --> 00:10:56,733
Diana.
Stop.

189
00:11:02,101 --> 00:11:03,934
Let us pray.

190
00:11:06,568 --> 00:11:07,834
<i>Let us pray.</i>

191
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,934
First six years of our marriage,
we lived in nine states.

192
00:11:39,501 --> 00:11:41,999
Ed was
in the military, so...

193
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,666
when he got the chance
to settle down...

194
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:45,999
you know,
the nice company car,

195
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,833
the big house,
the even bigger salary...

196
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:50,933
i pushed him
to take that job.

197
00:11:50,934 --> 00:11:55,033
Head of security
for desert canyon heat and air.

198
00:11:55,034 --> 00:11:57,100
Come on, what kind
of heat and air factory

199
00:11:57,101 --> 00:11:59,267
needs that kind
of security?

200
00:12:05,134 --> 00:12:06,433
What did you do there?

201
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,966
Me?

202
00:12:08,967 --> 00:12:10,966
Um...

203
00:12:10,967 --> 00:12:15,300
coffee and sandwich cart...
waitress on wheels.

204
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:17,400
I never knew
what went on there.

205
00:12:17,401 --> 00:12:19,966
No one does.

206
00:12:19,967 --> 00:12:21,467
Ed never said
a damn thing about it,

207
00:12:21,468 --> 00:12:23,467
and every time i'd ask,
he'd just shut me down,

208
00:12:23,468 --> 00:12:25,467
so i stopped asking.

209
00:12:25,468 --> 00:12:27,966
We all did.

210
00:12:27,967 --> 00:12:29,966
None of this
is your fault.

211
00:12:29,967 --> 00:12:31,766
Ed was a decent man.

212
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:35,667
Whatever went on there,
he was a decent man.

213
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,334
Decent people
can get caught up in things.

214
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:49,567
I found these when i was going
through ed's things.

215
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:53,266
I've never seen them before
in my life.

216
00:12:53,267 --> 00:12:55,966
This one goes
to a storage locker.

217
00:12:55,967 --> 00:12:58,732
You don't have
a storage locker, do you?

218
00:12:58,733 --> 00:13:00,599
No.

219
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,100
I've been meaning to go there,
but then i get scared.

220
00:13:03,101 --> 00:13:06,767
So i tell myself some doors
are better left unopened.

221
00:13:09,101 --> 00:13:12,034
Not this one.

222
00:13:50,701 --> 00:13:52,600
Looks like
you could use a lift.

223
00:13:52,601 --> 00:13:54,566
What's that?
A lift.
You want one?

224
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:57,466
Oh, yeah, sure.
Uh...
yeah.

225
00:13:57,467 --> 00:13:58,700
Great. Thanks.

226
00:13:58,701 --> 00:14:01,067
Appreciate it.

227
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,799
Condolences.

228
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,133
It's not my funeral,
but thanks.

229
00:14:16,134 --> 00:14:18,633
<i>I'm an osha
investigator.</i>

230
00:14:18,634 --> 00:14:20,267
I'm looking
into the explosion.

231
00:14:23,134 --> 00:14:25,334
Big change
from being a cop.

232
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,333
Yeah.

233
00:14:29,334 --> 00:14:31,166
23 years, baltimore,

234
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,600
4th precinct,
pikesville.

235
00:14:32,601 --> 00:14:33,600
You a local?

236
00:14:33,601 --> 00:14:37,667
My... my wife
worked up at the plant.

237
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,433
She, uh...

238
00:14:39,434 --> 00:14:41,066
she knew
a lot of these people.

239
00:14:41,067 --> 00:14:43,900
My condolences.

240
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,832
So what do you think?

241
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:51,832
About what?

242
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,133
<i>What happened.</i>

243
00:14:53,134 --> 00:14:54,600
I think it's too early
to tell.

244
00:14:54,601 --> 00:14:56,199
Would you
even if you knew?

245
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,366
<i>Tell?
Yeah.</i>

246
00:14:57,367 --> 00:14:58,600
No.

247
00:14:58,601 --> 00:15:01,799
You know, people say
it wasn't an accident.

248
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,166
Is that right?

249
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,533
They say something
was going on up there

250
00:15:05,534 --> 00:15:07,799
<i>other than heating
and air-conditioning.</i>

251
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,700
Something
as in what exactly?

252
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:11,633
That's
what i'm asking you.

253
00:15:11,634 --> 00:15:14,567
Suppose you knew something
was going on out there.

254
00:15:16,134 --> 00:15:17,999
What would you do?

255
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,999
Absolutely nothing.

256
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,667
Absolutely nothing?

257
00:15:21,668 --> 00:15:23,900
That's what i said.

258
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,199
Thanks for the ride.

259
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,700
No problem.

260
00:15:31,701 --> 00:15:33,899
I think i'm... i'm gonna walk
the rest of the way.

261
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,066
No problem.

262
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:37,267
<i>Good luck
with your investigation.</i>

263
00:15:57,634 --> 00:15:58,667
<i>
Empty.</i>

264
00:15:58,668 --> 00:16:01,067
Empty.

265
00:16:03,034 --> 00:16:05,799
I did not know
that man.

266
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,100
I loved him,
but i didn't know him.

267
00:16:10,634 --> 00:16:13,733
Sometimes
that's for the best.

268
00:16:13,734 --> 00:16:15,566
He called me.

269
00:16:15,567 --> 00:16:18,668
<i>Ed did, three days ago,
for the last time.</i>

270
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,733
He must've dialed
by accident.

271
00:16:22,734 --> 00:16:24,466
<i>
My name's winston.</i>

272
00:16:24,467 --> 00:16:27,233
<i>I install air-conditioning,
all right?</i>

273
00:16:27,234 --> 00:16:28,500
<i>Please don't hurt me.
</i>

274
00:16:28,501 --> 00:16:31,301
<i>I have a wife.</i>

275
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,234
What happened
to him, sarah?

276
00:17:03,301 --> 00:17:06,300
I can't die here.

277
00:17:06,301 --> 00:17:09,033
<i>Somebody tell me
i'm not gonna die here.</i>

278
00:17:09,034 --> 00:17:12,133
You won't die here.

279
00:17:12,134 --> 00:17:14,500
I hate these people.

280
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:16,533
I don't relate
to any of them.

281
00:17:16,534 --> 00:17:18,199
Great.
Thanks, zoe.

282
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,099
Hey, what
if we just kept driving?

283
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,999
<i>Got on the highway
and didn't stop</i>

284
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,199
till we hit
somewhere amazing?

285
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,134
The grand canyon.

286
00:17:26,434 --> 00:17:28,466
I went there
when i was a kid.

287
00:17:28,467 --> 00:17:29,932
<i>My mom and i took mules</i>

288
00:17:29,933 --> 00:17:31,199
down into the canyon.

289
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,667
Sounds cool.

290
00:17:33,668 --> 00:17:35,700
Uh, it would've been if my mule
wasn't completely schizo.

291
00:17:35,701 --> 00:17:37,533
He ate my spare shirt.

292
00:17:37,534 --> 00:17:38,799
I've never been.

293
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,300
Got a postcard
from there once.

294
00:17:41,301 --> 00:17:42,566
Okay, seriously,

295
00:17:42,567 --> 00:17:43,999
<i>if you start talking
about mike thompson,</i>

296
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,966
i'm getting
out of the car.

297
00:17:45,967 --> 00:17:47,500
Boyfriend?

298
00:17:47,501 --> 00:17:50,333
Ex.
And he was a good guy...

299
00:17:50,334 --> 00:17:51,500
until he ditched me.

300
00:17:51,501 --> 00:17:53,333
What happened?

301
00:17:53,334 --> 00:17:54,466
He was just like
the rest of us.

302
00:17:54,467 --> 00:17:56,833
<i>His mom worked
at the plant.</i>

303
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,300
Mike was just
a normal, funny guy.

304
00:18:02,301 --> 00:18:04,500
He liked watching
his monty python movies

305
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:07,199
and playing lacrosse.

306
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,566
What happened to him?

307
00:18:09,567 --> 00:18:11,832
Apparently, his mom had violated
some confidentiality agreement

308
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,267
or something
at the plant.

309
00:18:14,434 --> 00:18:16,333
They just...

310
00:18:16,334 --> 00:18:17,832
up and left
in the middle of the night.

311
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:19,199
Mike never said
a word about it.

312
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,899
I woke up one morning,
and he was just gone.

313
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,999
<i>A few months later</i>

314
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,566
<i>i got a postcard</i>

315
00:18:25,567 --> 00:18:27,767
from the grand canyon.
He was a real prize.

316
00:18:27,768 --> 00:18:29,433
Shut up, henry.

317
00:18:29,434 --> 00:18:30,600
Why don't you think

318
00:18:30,601 --> 00:18:32,000
about somebody
besides yourself for once, huh?

319
00:18:35,167 --> 00:18:37,867
You're not the only person
who's lost someone.

320
00:18:40,134 --> 00:18:41,566
Zoe's not in love
with you.

321
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:43,433
What?

322
00:18:43,434 --> 00:18:44,967
She doesn't love you
the way you love her.

323
00:18:50,301 --> 00:18:52,400
Get out of the car.
What?

324
00:18:52,401 --> 00:18:54,033
I want them out!

325
00:18:54,034 --> 00:18:55,066
<i>Henry, just go!</i>

326
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:56,099
<i>Go!</i>

327
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,799
Are you gonna go?

328
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,734
No.

329
00:19:01,601 --> 00:19:05,267
Hey, what are you...
what are you doing?!
Get out.

330
00:19:10,601 --> 00:19:11,600
Make a right
over here.

331
00:19:11,601 --> 00:19:12,966
What the hell
is going on?

332
00:19:12,967 --> 00:19:13,999
Shh.
Look, i can't deal

333
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,267
with another funeral, henry,
not right now.

334
00:19:24,867 --> 00:19:28,200
Hey, do you want to see
something really messed up?

335
00:19:46,501 --> 00:19:49,166
<i>
One day you'll be out here,</i>

336
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:50,999
<i>and they're lying there

337
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,166
dead.

338
00:19:52,167 --> 00:19:54,600
And the next day
they're gone.

339
00:19:54,601 --> 00:19:56,899
Like mike.

340
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,566
Yeah, like mike.

341
00:19:59,567 --> 00:20:01,534
What's killing them?

342
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,566
Idiots with guns.

343
00:20:05,567 --> 00:20:07,500
No bullet wounds.

344
00:20:07,501 --> 00:20:08,734
What are you,
dr. Quinn medicine woman?

345
00:20:10,234 --> 00:20:11,534
Maybe it's the water.

346
00:21:10,467 --> 00:21:12,133
<i>
They always
did want to be rich.</i>

347
00:21:12,134 --> 00:21:14,133
That's what henry said.

348
00:21:14,134 --> 00:21:16,167
His mom wanted
the good things.

349
00:21:16,168 --> 00:21:19,133
Careful what
you wish for, huh?

350
00:21:19,134 --> 00:21:22,000
What do you mean?

351
00:21:22,001 --> 00:21:24,000
Insurance money...

352
00:21:24,001 --> 00:21:26,068
the company's agreed to pay.
We're all rich.

353
00:21:31,267 --> 00:21:32,833
<i>
What did henry's father do</i>

354
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:34,599
at the plant
anyway?

355
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,933
He went to work in the morning,
came home at night,

356
00:21:36,934 --> 00:21:38,067
didn't talk about it.

357
00:21:38,068 --> 00:21:40,666
Same as everybody else
that worked there.

358
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:42,100
I don't get it.

359
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:43,599
What's so secret about heating
and air-conditioning?

360
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,332
The secret is, is it wasn't
heating and air-conditioning.

361
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:47,232
What was it?

362
00:21:47,233 --> 00:21:48,599
Some kind
of government project.

363
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,433
<i>That's what i think.</i>

364
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,199
<i>There's some smart people
around here,</i>

365
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,232
real smart.

366
00:21:54,233 --> 00:21:55,966
So you think what...

367
00:21:55,967 --> 00:21:58,800
that somebody
sabotaged the plant

368
00:21:58,801 --> 00:22:01,633
and killed
all these people?

369
00:22:01,634 --> 00:22:03,199
Your father?

370
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,466
It wasn't
an accident, john.

371
00:22:07,467 --> 00:22:09,734
Moo.

372
00:22:11,767 --> 00:22:16,000
* there's a land
that is fairer than day *

373
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,499
<i>* and by faith *</i>

374
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,332
<i>* we can see it afar *</i>

375
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:23,033
<i>* for the father *</i>

376
00:22:23,034 --> 00:22:27,366
<i>* waits over the way *</i>

377
00:22:27,367 --> 00:22:28,933
<i>* to prepare us *</i>

378
00:22:28,934 --> 00:22:31,833
<i>* a dwelling place there *</i>

379
00:22:31,834 --> 00:22:34,599
<i>* in the sweet *</i>

380
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,466
<i>* by and by *</i>

381
00:22:38,467 --> 00:22:39,800
<i>* we shall meet *</i>

382
00:22:39,801 --> 00:22:42,933
<i>* on that beautiful shore *</i>

383
00:22:42,934 --> 00:22:46,633
<i>* in the sweet *</i>

384
00:22:46,634 --> 00:22:48,766
<i>* by and by *</i>

385
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:50,800
<i>* we shall meet *</i>

386
00:22:50,801 --> 00:22:54,901
<i>* on that beautiful shore *</i>

387
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:58,833
the guy who shot me
is either a serial killer

388
00:22:58,834 --> 00:23:01,000
or a true believer.

389
00:23:01,001 --> 00:23:03,433
His wife thinks
he was murdered.

390
00:23:03,434 --> 00:23:06,600
She's right.

391
00:23:08,667 --> 00:23:11,167
<i>But nothing
about the, uh, the thing</i>

392
00:23:11,168 --> 00:23:12,167
you think you saw?

393
00:23:12,168 --> 00:23:14,700
The drone or whatever?

394
00:23:14,701 --> 00:23:17,101
I don't think i saw it.
I saw it.

395
00:23:21,168 --> 00:23:22,633
Who's he?

396
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:25,666
Looking for something.

397
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:28,033
I figure the best way
to find out what it is,

398
00:23:28,034 --> 00:23:29,900
<i>is to let him find it.</i>

399
00:23:29,901 --> 00:23:31,399
He made you.

400
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,199
<i>He'll try and lose you,</i>

401
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,466
but he doesn't know me.

402
00:23:34,467 --> 00:23:36,133
I'll handle it.

403
00:23:36,134 --> 00:23:37,499
You always do.

404
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,834
Skynet's here, reese.
I can feel it.

405
00:23:43,834 --> 00:23:45,400
What?

406
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,901
You called me
"reese" again.

407
00:23:51,967 --> 00:23:54,800
That's what you used
to call him, isn't it?

408
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:56,068
Kyle?

409
00:24:00,801 --> 00:24:03,367
You know, maybe you should try
to let him go.

410
00:24:05,168 --> 00:24:06,934
Maybe you should.

411
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,733
Is henry gonna be okay?

412
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:04,367
Henry smokes
a lot of weed.

413
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,633
You know, my father died
before i was even born.

414
00:25:09,634 --> 00:25:11,833
Yeah, well, my father's a pile
of ashes somewhere,

415
00:25:11,834 --> 00:25:13,667
so i guess
we're both screwed.

416
00:25:16,168 --> 00:25:19,200
I thought you picked out
a gray suit to bury him in.

417
00:25:23,634 --> 00:25:26,000
Why am i even talking
to you?

418
00:25:26,001 --> 00:25:27,167
You don't know me.

419
00:25:27,168 --> 00:25:29,100
You don't know
what i'm going through.

420
00:25:29,101 --> 00:25:30,366
Stop trying to make it seem

421
00:25:30,367 --> 00:25:32,766
like you're some kind
of sensitivity expert.

422
00:25:32,767 --> 00:25:33,767
You don't know
anything.

423
00:25:42,467 --> 00:25:43,901
She's not crying.

424
00:25:48,168 --> 00:25:50,101
She's not doing
a lot of things.

425
00:26:02,967 --> 00:26:04,966
Mr. Ellison,

426
00:26:04,967 --> 00:26:07,366
come in.

427
00:26:07,367 --> 00:26:08,600
You've changed
your tie.

428
00:26:10,867 --> 00:26:11,933
Is that plaid?

429
00:26:11,934 --> 00:26:14,800
Yes, um,
i went home at lunch.

430
00:26:14,801 --> 00:26:17,067
I hope
you don't mind. I...

431
00:26:17,068 --> 00:26:19,499
i spoke to mr. Murch,
and he spoke of, um...

432
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,000
lachlan's death.

433
00:26:21,001 --> 00:26:22,966
<i>My sympathies.
Yes.</i>

434
00:26:22,967 --> 00:26:25,332
Thank you.

435
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:29,366
I remember
when my father died.

436
00:26:29,367 --> 00:26:32,134
He was, um...

437
00:26:33,934 --> 00:26:36,666
he was a tough man.
We didn't get along.

438
00:26:36,667 --> 00:26:38,900
Even so, it took me
a long time

439
00:26:38,901 --> 00:26:41,399
to come to terms
with his passing.

440
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,933
I threw myself into work
so i wouldn't have to.

441
00:26:43,934 --> 00:26:46,466
Was this recent?

442
00:26:46,467 --> 00:26:47,933
Recent enough.

443
00:26:47,934 --> 00:26:49,766
Then you understand.

444
00:26:49,767 --> 00:26:51,233
I do.

445
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,232
So how's savannah doing
with this?

446
00:26:56,233 --> 00:26:58,100
Do?

447
00:26:58,101 --> 00:27:01,332
How is she dealing
with her father's death?

448
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:04,966
Dr. Sherman was very helpful
in that regard.

449
00:27:04,967 --> 00:27:06,966
Now he's gone, too.

450
00:27:06,967 --> 00:27:10,366
Children are nothing
if not resilient.

451
00:27:10,367 --> 00:27:13,232
I'm surprised
she's not here.

452
00:27:13,233 --> 00:27:14,866
Why?

453
00:27:14,867 --> 00:27:17,533
Being the anniversary,
i mean.

454
00:27:17,534 --> 00:27:19,399
Yes.

455
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,433
I guess
that is surprising.

456
00:27:22,434 --> 00:27:24,100
Dr. Sherman
felt it was important

457
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:26,599
for a child to maintain
a regular routine.

458
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,967
Today's not the day
for excitement.

459
00:27:34,534 --> 00:27:37,033
Would you excuse me,

460
00:27:37,034 --> 00:27:39,100
mr. Ellison?

461
00:27:39,101 --> 00:27:42,000
I'm feeling emotional.

462
00:27:42,001 --> 00:27:44,533
Yes.

463
00:27:44,534 --> 00:27:46,967
Of course.

464
00:28:02,734 --> 00:28:04,067
Victoria?

465
00:28:04,068 --> 00:28:06,068
<i>Ms. Weaver.</i>

466
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,066
And i'd have to say
that this is one of them,

467
00:28:53,067 --> 00:28:55,900
where it seems every single
logical step we take

468
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:59,566
leads to
the most bizarre place.

469
00:28:59,567 --> 00:29:01,233
You mean crashing
that poor guy's wake

470
00:29:01,234 --> 00:29:04,399
and eating
his widow's shrimp skewers?

471
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,400
Yeah, derek,
i mean that.

472
00:29:09,168 --> 00:29:11,499
What's the point?

473
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,267
You know
what the point is.

474
00:29:13,268 --> 00:29:15,833
Your mom thinks that factory
was linked to skynet.

475
00:29:15,834 --> 00:29:17,833
Yeah, and you think
she's nuts.

476
00:29:17,834 --> 00:29:20,268
Doesn't mean i think
she's wrong.

477
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,000
<i>
She hasn't looked</i>

478
00:29:25,001 --> 00:29:27,100
at her father's picture
since we've been here...

479
00:29:27,101 --> 00:29:30,332
not once.

480
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:31,733
Neither
has her mother.

481
00:29:31,734 --> 00:29:33,399
Yeah, and?

482
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,299
If you had a photo
of kyle reese,

483
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,001
you'd look at it,
wouldn't you?

484
00:29:42,001 --> 00:29:44,699
Maybe there's something
i don't understand.

485
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,834
He's not dead.

486
00:29:49,634 --> 00:29:50,933
That's a big leap.

487
00:29:50,934 --> 00:29:52,833
Let me repeat
what she said.

488
00:29:52,834 --> 00:29:54,167
If you had a photo
of your brother,

489
00:29:54,168 --> 00:29:55,634
would you
or would you not look at it?

490
00:30:05,834 --> 00:30:08,200
He's not dead.

491
00:30:08,201 --> 00:30:09,901
We should find him
before he is.

492
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:49,734
What are you doing
in my parents' room?

493
00:32:54,801 --> 00:32:56,500
Your father's alive,
isn't he?

494
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,534
Get out.

495
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,800
Hey.
Let me go!

496
00:33:02,801 --> 00:33:03,866
Zoe, i know you're scared,

497
00:33:03,867 --> 00:33:05,133
and i know you want
to protect him,

498
00:33:05,134 --> 00:33:06,466
but you don't know
what's been going on.

499
00:33:06,467 --> 00:33:07,733
Get away from me,
you freak!

500
00:33:07,734 --> 00:33:09,100
Let me help you.
You can't.

501
00:33:09,101 --> 00:33:10,100
Yes, i can.

502
00:33:10,101 --> 00:33:11,934
No.

503
00:34:18,934 --> 00:34:20,934
Derek?

504
00:34:24,767 --> 00:34:26,432
Hey.

505
00:34:26,433 --> 00:34:27,633
Where are you?

506
00:34:27,634 --> 00:34:29,699
In a garage.

507
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,800
Garage, where?

508
00:34:30,801 --> 00:34:32,499
It's a long story.
Where are you?

509
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:35,766
We're at a wake...

510
00:34:35,767 --> 00:34:37,534
a fake wake.

511
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:56,666
<i>
The whole place was wired,</i>

512
00:34:56,667 --> 00:34:59,066
every house
in the neighborhood.

513
00:34:59,067 --> 00:35:00,499
Every move anyone ever made
was being watched.

514
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,201
Skynet work camp.

515
00:35:04,034 --> 00:35:05,299
This is how
they were set up.

516
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,633
People working
for the machines

517
00:35:06,634 --> 00:35:09,599
monitored by other people
working for the machines.

518
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,599
Who are you people?

519
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,599
I need to know what they
were building in that plant.

520
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,933
I need to know who owned it,
and i need to know right now.

521
00:35:15,934 --> 00:35:18,733
I don't...
how would i know?

522
00:35:18,734 --> 00:35:20,399
Because the tunnel led
to your garage, that's how.

523
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,801
My husband's garage.

524
00:35:25,201 --> 00:35:26,666
Look, we don't know
you people.

525
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:28,900
<i>For all we know, you could be
responsible for this.</i>

526
00:35:28,901 --> 00:35:31,033
You could be
some terrorist organization.

527
00:35:31,034 --> 00:35:32,599
We are some kind
of terrorist organization.

528
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,766
And believe me, if someone
hadn't blown up that plant,

529
00:35:34,767 --> 00:35:35,766
i would.

530
00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:38,233
Now, where's your husband?

531
00:35:38,234 --> 00:35:40,299
He's dead.

532
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:43,499
No, he's not dead...

533
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,000
yet.

534
00:35:45,001 --> 00:35:46,233
Wait, wait.

535
00:35:46,234 --> 00:35:48,133
Please,
he's innocent.

536
00:35:48,134 --> 00:35:50,233
He is. John, you have
to believe me.

537
00:35:50,234 --> 00:35:51,432
No, i don't have to.

538
00:35:51,433 --> 00:35:53,000
I was with him
when he got the news

539
00:35:53,001 --> 00:35:54,666
that everyone was dead,
he was freaked out.

540
00:35:54,667 --> 00:35:55,966
<i>And he was trying to figure out
what to do,</i>

541
00:35:55,967 --> 00:35:57,666
<i>and he didn't know
what to do.</i>

542
00:35:57,667 --> 00:35:58,966
He was scared,
like we all are.

543
00:35:58,967 --> 00:36:00,900
What were they building
at the plant?

544
00:36:00,901 --> 00:36:01,900
I don't...
nobody knows.

545
00:36:01,901 --> 00:36:02,900
How can you not know?

546
00:36:02,901 --> 00:36:04,133
How can any
of you not know?

547
00:36:04,134 --> 00:36:06,233
How can you just sleepwalk
through your lives?

548
00:36:06,234 --> 00:36:08,233
Just tell us what they were
building at the plant.

549
00:36:08,234 --> 00:36:10,066
Just stop it!

550
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:11,733
He told us
he was gonna play dead!

551
00:36:11,734 --> 00:36:14,599
He told us everybody else had
died, that he should've died,

552
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,599
and that it would be better if
that's what everybody thought!

553
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,800
That is what he said!

554
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:20,800
Now, you think i'm sad,

555
00:36:20,801 --> 00:36:22,100
that i am pathetic,
that i what...

556
00:36:22,101 --> 00:36:24,267
that i just sleepwalked my way
through all of this.

557
00:36:24,268 --> 00:36:26,267
Well, maybe you're right.
Maybe i looked the other way.

558
00:36:26,268 --> 00:36:29,666
Well, we all did,
every one of us.

559
00:36:29,667 --> 00:36:31,599
And maybe that's not
what you think you would do,

560
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,000
but that is
what most people do.

561
00:36:33,001 --> 00:36:34,399
Mom, you don't owe
them this.

562
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,633
So there's not plant now,
no plant, no charm acres.

563
00:36:36,634 --> 00:36:39,432
But it is a lot
of insurance money,

564
00:36:39,433 --> 00:36:42,666
enough for my family
to get lost and start over.

565
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:46,167
<i>So i didn't ask
any questions.</i>

566
00:36:46,168 --> 00:36:49,134
Why would i start now
when we are so close?

567
00:36:50,367 --> 00:36:51,499
Look at this.

568
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,001
<i>I pulled this
from the archives.</i>

569
00:37:03,834 --> 00:37:06,801
Mike?

570
00:37:24,934 --> 00:37:27,201
Daddy?

571
00:37:30,934 --> 00:37:33,766
You may not like
asking questions,

572
00:37:33,767 --> 00:37:36,933
but me, once i get started,
i can't stop.

573
00:37:36,934 --> 00:37:38,801
Mom.

574
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,300
I think i know
where he might be.

575
00:37:52,433 --> 00:37:54,766
Hey!

576
00:37:54,767 --> 00:37:57,100
Excuse me.

577
00:37:57,101 --> 00:38:00,366
I've been watching you.
You want to know what i see?

578
00:38:00,367 --> 00:38:02,733
What do you see,
diana?

579
00:38:02,734 --> 00:38:04,699
Ed would say
you don't smell right.

580
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:08,233
Well, i guess
ed would know.

581
00:38:08,234 --> 00:38:10,766
Look, i deserve
the truth.

582
00:38:10,767 --> 00:38:14,766
I opened up to you.

583
00:38:14,767 --> 00:38:18,500
Sometimes it's better
not to ask too many questions.

584
00:38:52,801 --> 00:38:54,000
You're crying.

585
00:38:54,001 --> 00:38:57,133
No.

586
00:38:57,134 --> 00:38:58,967
Yes, you are.

587
00:39:05,867 --> 00:39:09,567
Come here.
I want to tell you something.

588
00:39:14,367 --> 00:39:18,200
I remember
when my father died.

589
00:39:18,201 --> 00:39:20,366
He was a tough man.

590
00:39:20,367 --> 00:39:22,699
We didn't get along.

591
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,699
Even so...

592
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:28,233
it took me a long time to come
to terms with his passing.

593
00:39:28,234 --> 00:39:32,399
Do you understand
what i'm

594
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,766
i miss daddy.

595
00:39:34,767 --> 00:39:37,432
What do you miss
about him?

596
00:39:37,433 --> 00:39:40,466
He used
to read me stories.

597
00:39:40,467 --> 00:39:43,432
I can read you
a story.

598
00:39:43,433 --> 00:39:45,566
He did it better.

599
00:39:45,567 --> 00:39:47,933
You know...

600
00:39:47,934 --> 00:39:51,766
anytime you want to see
your father, we have videos.

601
00:39:51,767 --> 00:39:53,833
It's not the same.

602
00:39:53,834 --> 00:39:55,600
Why?

603
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,201
I can't sit on his lap.

604
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:03,766
Come,

605
00:40:03,767 --> 00:40:06,967
sit on my lap.

606
00:40:09,134 --> 00:40:11,599
Your lap is cold.

607
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,001
I know.

608
00:40:57,734 --> 00:40:59,566
Where are we, john?

609
00:40:59,567 --> 00:41:01,534
What is this place?

610
00:41:03,934 --> 00:41:05,700
I don't know.
