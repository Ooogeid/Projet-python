In the future, my son will lead
mankind in a war against skynet...

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,450
A computer system programmed
to destroy the world.

3
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,390
It has sent machines
back through time...

4
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:18,500
Some to kill him,
one to protect him.

5
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,160
Today, we fight to stop
skynet from ever being created,

6
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:26,880
to change our future,
to change his fate.

7
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,130
The war to save mankind begins now.

Previously, on terminator:
the sarah connor chronicles...

12
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:42,780
I need three sets of papers.

13
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,460
20,000--that's a family
discount in these hard times.

14
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,220
Especially for someone
who's been dead eight years.

15
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,010
Your fiancee killed a man
because she believes that,x

16
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:54,830
in the future, he'll invent a computer
system that declares war on the world.

17
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,650
Skynet robots from the future.

18
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,320
And you're one of them.

19
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,140
Yes. I'm that.

20
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:08,160
These things, all of them are
programmed with specific missions.

21
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:14,570
Don't let that thing touch me.

22
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:15,750
We have to stop you bleeding!

23
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:16,560
Get away from me!

24
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,730
You don't even know
who this guy is!

25
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:18,490
He's your uncle.

26
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:19,690
He doesn't know.

27
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,970
My turk could defeat
ewery human player

28
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,180
that has ever lived and
probably ever will live.

29
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:26,760
You talk about it like it's human.

30
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,310
Well, you never know.

31
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:29,420
What about the turk?

32
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,090
I was paid money for it.

33
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,470
That's all i have.

34
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:41,980
Sarkissian returned my call.

35
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,480
He'll meet about selling the turk.

38
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,890
When john was little, he used to
sleep with his hand under my chin.

39
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,700
At night, i lay awake watching him.

40
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:03,150
Calm, peaceful, happy.

41
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:07,570
I wanted to freeze time and let
my son live in that moment forever.

42
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:10,920
But you can't freeze time.

43
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:14,090
You can't protect your children
from the future that awaits them.

44
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,670
Batting's hard, derek.

45
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,780
You're doing great, kyle.

46
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,820
Just remember how i showed you.

47
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,350
Stay on top of the ball.

48
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,160
????

49
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,640
And then...

50
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:27,880
Yes!

51
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,700
Finally!

52
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:29,890
It's gone.

53
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:32,700
Fireworks!

54
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,230
??????

55
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,490
He's a very hot-headed man.

56
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,090
I learned armenian.

57
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:01,980
Armenian.

58
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,140
The guy we're meeting
with, his name's sarkissian.

59
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,100
That's armenian.

60
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,890
Well, we're not here to charm him.

61
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,470
We're here to get the
turk and get out, simple.

62
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,280
He said we should
meet him at table 19.

63
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,730
Excuse me, i think we have
some business to take care of.

64
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,760
Oh, of course. Sorry.

65
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,700
Table 19.

66
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,280
It's right there.

67
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,080
Keep the change.

68
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,430
Remind me again.

69
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:33,790
Why--why are the boys out
here and the girls in there?

70
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:38,650
Because one of the boys
is still wanted for murder,

71
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:40,410
and one of the girls is...

72
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,220
Harder than nuclear nails.

73
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,720
And the other one's a cyborg.

74
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,440
You wanna know why
we're really here?

75
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:48,940
Why?

76
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,040
Moore's law.

77
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,010
Moore's law.

78
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,030
The guy who founded intel
said that every two years,

79
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,700
the number of transistors
on a computer chip doubles.

80
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,920
30 years ago, it
was an observation.

81
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,060
Now it's a law.

82
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,070
Tech industry spent
billions doubling chip power.

83
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,090
And?

84
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,940
And that's how we can
go from a chess computer

85
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,130
to the apocalypse
in just four years.

86
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:18,210
I learned that a lot
can happen in four years.

87
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,870
A lot can happen in four seconds.

88
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,380
One minute, i'm in the yard with
my brother, playing baseball,

89
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,400
and the next, we look
up, and the sky's on fire.

90
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,360
Judgment day.

91
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:34,910
What'd you do?

92
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,670
The only thing to do: took
kyle and went underground.

93
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,490
What was he like?

94
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,160
He was just a kid when it happened.

95
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,160
Eight years old.

96
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,140
I was 15.

97
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,410
How do you tell an eight-year-old
machines have taken over the world?

98
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,660
How do you?

99
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,380
You don't.

100
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,370
Maybe he's at another table.

101
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,100
I understand you're
interested in buying the turk.

102
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,150
yes

00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:48,600

Nice doing business with you.

105
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,170
We don't have $500,000.

106
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,100
Not yet.

107
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,740
???????

108
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,480
It's been a long time since we
spoke. So, what, eight years?

109
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,150
Mm, i see you're a man of faith.

110
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:28,340
Oh, no, my wife's a catholic.

111
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:29,880
It's her mother's.

112
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:33,270
Do you know the story on
the rapture, mr. Dixon?

113
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,760
Like i said, my wife.

114
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,150
Hmm.

115
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,370
"and i heard, as it were,
"the noise of thunder.

116
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,770
"and i heard the voice of the
fourth beast say, "'come and see'.

117
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,260
"and i looked.

118
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,500
"and behold, a pale horse.

119
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,480
"and his name that
sat on him was death.

120
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,700
And hell followed with him.

121
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,260
" the book of revelation.

122
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:05,430
What is this?

123
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,020
I've seen some things, mr.Dixon.

124
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,030
I've seen some things with my own
eyes, and heard 'em with my own ears.

125
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,850
I've beheld.

126
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,420
And upon my beholding,
i've come to the conclusion,

127
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:32,610
while new to me, might
be old hat for you.

128
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,560
What the hell are
you talkin' about?

129
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,400
Sarah connor's alive.

130
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,660
And i think you know where she is.

131
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:40,680
You're crazy.

132
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,720
If sarah is alive,
and i believe she is,

133
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:56,260
we are working in the realm where
much, perhaps anything, is possible.

134
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,740
Robots...

135
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,880
Soldiers from the future, skynet.

136
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:07,720
If...

137
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:13,740
Sarah were alive, i'm sure
she'd like to hear you say that.

138
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,280
Co on, tell me what you know.

139
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,290
I'm gonna tell you...

140
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,540
What i told the other guy.

141
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,120
I don't know anything.

142
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,220
The other guy?

143
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,820
The other agent you guys sent here.

144
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:30,710
Kester.

145
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:33,590
Kester?

146
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:02,770
Ooh!

147
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,170
Can i help you with something...

148
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:27,910
Bro?

149
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,060
That is a nice sword.

150
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:32,970
Hey...

151
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:34,490
You don't touch that.

152
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:35,580
Family heirloom?

153
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,900
None of your business.

154
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,790
You're right.

155
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,640
But this is my business.

156
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,230
Shh, shh, shh.

157
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,670
Do you know this woman?

158
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,310
I never seen her before in my life.

159
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,980
Well, i'll help you out.

160
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,030
Her name's sarah connor.

161
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,340
I know that, because
i read her f.B.I.File.

162
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,330
I told you.

163
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,980
I don't know her.

164
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:06,600
Well, that's...

165
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,000
Very interesting.

166
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,840
Because your uncle
enrique knew her.

167
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,930
He knew her pretty well, in fact.

168
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,380
And you know what?

169
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,600
He's in that file too.

170
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:24,130
As one of the last known
associates and an f.B.I.Informant...

171
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:29,520
You know what i think?

172
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,750
I think she went to him
looking for identification.

173
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,480
And i think he sent her to you.

174
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:47,080
And i think, after she got what she
wanted, she went back to enrique.

175
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:52,530
And i think she killed him.

176
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,970
And now i have something she wants.

177
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,280
So where is she?

178
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:07,570
"los ninos heroes.

179
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:13,160
" they were the six military cadets
that died defending chapultepec castle.

180
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:16,910
Bright boys.

181
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,190
Now, my friend...

182
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:39,500
How brave a boy are you?

183
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,630
I'll handle this.

184
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,490
What are you doing here?

185
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:58,360
I need to talk to you.

186
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:58,990
Go home.

187
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,550
Agent ellison came into my house.

188
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,060
And you turn around
and come to mine?

189
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,680
I know, it's okay.

190
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,440
This is gonna be hard
for you to imagine, but...

191
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,120
I think he's ready to believe you.

192
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,210
Believe me?

193
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:14,920
Charlie, this isn't
about believing me.

194
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,870
If he believes you,
he can protect you.

195
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,250
Do you remember what you saw here?

196
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:19,950
What we destroyed?

197
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:20,780
Who destroyed it?

198
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,460
The f.B.I.Can't protect us.

199
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,750
You can't protect us.

200
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,050
If one of them follows
you here, not the f.B.I...

201
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:28,130
One of them...

202
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:30,110
He'll have killed us.

203
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:32,390
So take your wife.

204
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,720
Get as far away
from here as you can.

205
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,520
Forget me.

206
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,320
?????

207
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:48,210
Bright yellow tint.

208
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,600
Grade "m.

209
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,970
" slightly included. Shallow cut.

210
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,140
You can't just give a briefcase
full of money to a guy like

211
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,310
that and expect he's just
gonna and over the turk.

212
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:57,390
Actually, i can.

213
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:01,920
Well, those are from the safe house i
set up, so, technically, they're mine.

214
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,450
Well, i'm guessing you stole them, so,
technically, they're evidence in a felony.

215
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:09,690
What are we up to?

216
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,120
Current estimated value, 246,000.

217
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,280
You don't even have enough.

218
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,570
We'll negotiate.

219
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,020
We don't even know what
this guy looks like.

220
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,720
We know what the turk looks like.

221
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,790
I love these places.

222
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,270
Food courts?

223
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,100
First day after me and
the guys jumped through,

224
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,440
we went to the century city mall
and we spent the whole day there.

225
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,830
We all puked.

226
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:44,820
You know, the funny thing, in the future,
that place is a concentration camp.

227
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:48,930
Is that it?

228
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:53,780
Where is he?

229
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,260
Son of a bitch stood us up again.

230
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,090
We have to go.

231
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,310
We came here for the turk.

232
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,950
We can't get it if we're in prison.

233
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:18,970
Sarah connor.

234
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,430
So nice to finally meet you.

235
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,450
You know, a woman...

236
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,270
She calls my!Cell phone.

237
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,360
She says she's interesting
in buying this...

238
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,290
Very special computer.

239
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,080
Now, what do you do?

240
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,410
You just turn around
and you just sell it?

241
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,830
Or, maybe...

242
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:51,680
You're very beautiful.

243
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:54,430
For a dead woman.

244
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:58,400
Just let us pay you for the computer,
and you'll never hear from us again.

245
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,240
If i was gonna sell you the
turk, you'd have had it by now.

246
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,580
So this is my counter offer.

247
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:07,200
The money you was gonna
pay me for the turk,

248
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,330
you take that number and
you multiply it by four.

249
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:11,950
$2 million?

250
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,100
You're a fugitive, ms.Connor.

251
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:17,350
Might make that a
small price for freedom.

252
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,060
Here's my counter offer.

253
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:25,360
You tell us where the
turk is, we keep our money,

254
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,450
and i bury you in the back yard.

255
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,590
Will you listen to me?

256
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,980
If i don't walk out
of here in ten minutes,

257
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,140
my people are instructed
to call the f.B.I.

258
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,560
And tell them everything i know.

259
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,210
Your people?

260
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:41,260
Yeah.

261
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,930
My people.

262
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,660
Same people who are
watching your son.

263
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,600
He's on a field trip, isn't he?

264
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:49,970
With his class?

265
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,820
Science museum, i believe.

266
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:58,080
Your people have no idea
what they're walking into.

267
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,970
Derek.

268
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,690
How long do we have
to get the money?

269
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,120
You got 24 hours.

270
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,530
Follow him.

271
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,360
You haven't spoken for 28 minutes.

272
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,130
Well, it's nothing.

273
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,100
All right.

274
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,820
My birthday's tomorrow.

275
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:01,800
Okay?

276
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,320
I know that mom totally forgot.

277
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:05,320
Birthday?

278
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,950
Hey, you don't know
what a birthday is?

279
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,760
It's the day you were born.

280
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,440
Pretty memorable
for a mother, right?

281
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,060
But it was 16 years ago.

282
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,120
No, a birthday's like a holiday.

283
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,920
Like once a year, every
year, people just kind of...

284
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,530
Celebrate you, i guess.

285
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,340
And you get presents
and you eat cake and...

286
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,350
It's fun.

287
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:27,750
It's supposed to be.

288
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,230
Last year, mom got
me a flak jacket.

289
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:33,930
That's a tight present.

290
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,500
No. It's not.

291
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,070
Whatever...

292
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,880
Look, i don't know why i care.

293
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:46,310
I've been driving since i was 12, and,
technically, this is my 24th birthday.

294
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,230
It's just i...

295
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,190
Time traveled over eight of them.

296
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,730
Do i have a birthday?

297
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:57,700
I don't know.

298
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,120
Were you born?

299
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:02,460
I was built.

300
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,040
Well, then, maybe you
have like a built day.

301
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,670
Hey, cameron, listen to this.

302
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,280
Hey, what do you
have on there, man?

303
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,560
Hatful of hollow, man.

304
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,090
Just downloaded it this morning.

305
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,170
Dude, you gotta be kidding me.

306
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,040
Cameron.

307
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,820
Stay with the group, please.

308
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,130
Sorry.

309
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,390
hey, cameron.

310
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:58,880
There you are.

311
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,400
your brother's been
looking for you.

312
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,390
Oh, wow.

313
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:05,090
Is this your car?

314
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:08,820
No, it belongs to the guy i
killed and stuffed in the trunk.

315
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:09,900
Hey!

316
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,190
Where you been?

317
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,720
Mom says we gotta
get home right now.

318
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:14,930
What's up with the car?

319
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:17,800
Cameron stuffed a
dead guy in the trunk.

320
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,250
He was following us.

321
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,390
Your sister's dark, bro.

322
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:26,020
You're gonna love the smiths.

323
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,450
Yeah, she's, uh, she's really goth.

324
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:29,180
Get in.

325
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,220
Wait, cameron.

326
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,160
Hey, um...

327
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,110
There's something i...

328
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,880
Kind of need to ask you.

329
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:40,730
Um, you think maybe you might
wanna go to the prom with me?

330
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:44,900
Just say yes!

331
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,850
Yes!

332
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:03,780
Hey, karen.

333
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,490
Can you run a name for me?

334
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,780
I thought you knew
everybody around here.

335
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:09,740
Who you looking for?

336
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,100
Guy's name is kester.

337
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,200
He's an agent.

338
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:13,830
Uh, it doesn't ring a bell.

339
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,750
Give me a sec.

340
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,050
There we go.

341
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:18,950
This the guy?

342
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:34,790
We've been so swamped lately, it's all
i can do to keep this place organized.

343
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:35,820
What file did you need?

344
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:40,140
File number 100-655371.

345
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,750
The sarah connor case.

346
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,780
Looks like it's
checked out, my friend.

347
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,570
To agent ellison.

348
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,810
James ellison?

349
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:51,850
One and only.

350
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,900
Thank you for your time.

351
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,090
Oh, hold the elevator.

352
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,310
He was a threat to us.

353
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,110
Did he say anything?

354
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,630
A name, a location?

355
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,870
He said very little.

356
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,420
And then he was quiet.

357
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,320
I lost sarkissian
at the cahuenga pass.

358
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:50,270
Damn it.

359
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,120
We have to find him.

360
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,470
We have to get out of this house.

361
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,000
No, we're not moving.

362
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,510
- He knows where we live, john.
- I don't care.

363
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,010
We're not running, not today.

364
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:00,500
This house has a bull's-eye
painued on the front door.

365
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,210
Do your thing.

366
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,340
Hello?

367
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,160
Are you still watching those kids?

368
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,470
I got my eye on them right now.

369
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:26,400
I think they have
someone following me.

370
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,490
No more games.

371
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:28,560
Bring them back here.

372
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,700
Here?

373
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,580
Where's here?

374
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:38,410
Okay, so he's expecting this
guy to show up there any minute.

375
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,750
And when he doesn't, the first
place he's gonna come is here.

376
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:42,800
Mom...

377
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,580
We can't stay here, john.

378
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:46,800
Not while he's out there.

379
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:47,980
It's too risky.

380
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:49,900
I'm sorry.

381
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,280
Wait here.

382
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,260
Where is he?

383
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:38,760
Who?

384
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:40,350
Uhh!

385
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:40,950
He.

386
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,010
Need i repeat?

387
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,560
John, go check the office.

388
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,570
See if he stashed
the turk in there.

389
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,610
Can you get through the door?

390
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:26,720
Yes.

391
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:29,890
But the wall would be much faster.

392
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,040
What are you doing here?

393
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:02,360
Waiting for my
daddy to finish work.

394
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:04,830
Okay, listen.

395
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:09,060
I need you to stay in this
room with the door closed, okay?

396
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:13,340
Even if you hear loud noises or you
get scared, you need to stay in here.

397
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,690
Can you do that for me?

398
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:15,580
Yeah.

399
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,450
Yeah?

400
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:17,390
Okay.

401
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:14,050
Let him go.

402
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,280
Not my kid.

403
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:18,400
Not mine either.

404
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:24,560
Are you okay?

405
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:34,470
John...

406
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,210
Let's go back inside.

407
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:22,900
Is that your daddy
out there in the alley?

408
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:23,990
No.

409
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,020
My daddy went to the cafe.

410
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,300
You know how to get
back there from here?

411
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,250
You go find your daddy.

412
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,850
Don't look back, just go.

413
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,520
Sarkissian's hard drive.

414
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:12,960
Do i need to kill you now?

415
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:51,850
Kester.

416
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,130
Yeah, that's what he
likes to call himself

417
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:56,350
when he's out trick-or-treating
in his f.B.I.Costume.

418
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:59,340
George lazlo's a better
actor than we thought.

419
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:00,600
That's not lazlo.

420
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:03,000
James, are we looking
at the same picture here?

421
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:04,410
This is your guy.

422
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:06,980
It's lazlo.

423
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,600
The blood doesn't match.

424
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:16,550
Come on, what are you saying?

425
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:18,430
That this guy somehow
killed six people

426
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:23,440
and then found a plastic surgeon who
made him look identical to george lazlo?

427
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,530
And then what?

428
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,740
Killed lazlo, stole his
identity, and then...

429
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:32,620
Put himself in the
f.B.I.Database as this guy kester?

430
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:34,290
To what end?

431
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:35,370
What's the goal here?

432
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:37,950
Who is he?

433
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,140
What is he?

434
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,300
What is he?

435
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:47,370
Yeah.

436
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:49,270
What is he?

437
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:51,680
What is he, that...

438
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:56,160
Stands across from a man after killing
two other men within 36 hours...

439
00:29:56,930 --> 00:30:01,930
And when asked of his involvement,
cannot only lie, but lie well?

440
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:06,520
And not only lie well,
but not blink or twitch

441
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:11,180
or perform one simple human
reaction to the situation.

442
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:13,050
So, yes...

443
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,480
I think it's fair
to ask: what is he?

444
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:23,080
You know as well as i
some men are monsters.

445
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,190
Yeah.

446
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,690
Monsters.

447
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:31,770
Let's go get him.

448
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:54,620
Mom...

449
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,630
Sorry.

450
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,370
Look, he double-encrypted
the drive.

451
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,800
I've unlocked a lot of it, but
there's still a lot left to go through.

452
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,560
How much?

453
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:05,190
That's about 1,000 useful files.

454
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:07,260
Each one takes about
five minutes to decrypt.

455
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,840
And i'm on number 37.

456
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:09,920
You do the math.

457
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,910
Let me know when
you have something.

458
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,810
How are you holding up?

459
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,380
I'm all right.

460
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,040
So it's your birtheay.

461
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:45,570
Yeah, how'd you know?

462
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,120
You kidding?

463
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:51,280
I celebrated your 30th with you.

464
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,400
How was that?

465
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:59,360
You got drunk as a skunk.

466
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:03,910
Come on.

467
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:04,670
I'll buy you a beer.

468
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,600
I'm 16.

469
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,050
All right, i'll buy
you an ice cream cone.

470
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,500
Come on.

471
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,500
It's your birthday.

472
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,670
When there are things to celebrate,
they should be celebrated.

473
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:16,190
Let's go.

474
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:29,910
Your mom has never
killed anyone, has she?

475
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:37,400
You know, she's got murder in her eyes
all the time, but her heart's pure.

476
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,020
It's a good thing, you know.

477
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,690
Keep a--keep
a pure heart.

478
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,400
It's beautiful here, isn't it?

479
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,090
You know, you stay long enough,

480
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:59,160
you start fooling yourself
into thinking that this is...

481
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:01,160
How it's always gonna be.

482
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:04,910
And you remember what this place'll
look like when it's on fire, and...

483
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:10,050
You realize you'll do whatever it takes
to keep from watching it burn again.

484
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,410
Is that...

485
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:47,480
You?

486
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,180
And the younger one, is that...

487
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,060
Kyle.

488
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:03,610
Throws pretty good for
a five-year-old, huh?

489
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,660
Your father always had a nice arm.

490
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:15,660
How'd you know?

491
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:17,960
Every time i look
at you, i see him.

492
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,330
Besides, your mom's his type.

493
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,460
??????????

494
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:37,040
?????????????F.B.I.Raid
in north hollywood.

495
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,610
Suspect considered armed
and extremely dangerous.

496
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:41,720
May be posing as an f.B.I.Agent.

497
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,270
Last name kester.

498
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:01,760
In lord of the flies, a group of
boys slaughter a pig in the jungle.

499
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,680
They torture it and place its head
on a sharpened stake as an offering

500
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:10,010
to the beast that hovers,
god-like, above the island.

501
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,450
Black blood drips
down the pig's teeth.

502
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,090
And the boys run away.

503
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:12,500
Later, when one of the
boys is alone, he weeps.

504
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,800
But not for the pig.

505
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:20,090
The boy weeps for the end of innocence
and the darkness of men's hearts.

506
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:38,270
Have you seen derek?

507
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,380
No.

508
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:43,880
He's, uh, still at
the park, i think.

509
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,150
And what were you two doing?

510
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:48,310
Nothing.

511
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:50,240
Uh, we just went
to get an ice cream.

512
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:52,540
Here.

513
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,010
Check these out.

514
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,440
Looks like you weren't the
only one looking for the turk.

515
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:02,540
Who's this?

516
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:04,030
I'm not sure.

517
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,580
But he came in after
dmitri and before you.

518
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:09,060
Enough time for sarkissian
to sell him the turk.

519
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:11,200
It's not much to go
on, but it's something.

520
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:19,560
Why don't you take a break?

521
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,690
No, no, it's all right.

522
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:21,310
I can keep going.

523
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:23,850
How are we supposed to
celebrate your birthday

524
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:25,850
if you're sitting in
front of a computer?

525
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,040
You actually thought
i forgot your birthday?

526
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:35,030
It's just we have much
more important things to

527
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:36,560
think about than
my stupid birthday.

528
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,950
Your birthday is important.

529
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:40,690
No, it's not important.

530
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:45,940
Finding the turk, stopping skynet,
judgment day-- that's important, that's...

531
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,110
That's our life.

532
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:50,060
It's our mission.

533
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,810
This is our life.

534
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:55,710
If we stop caring about
that, then we're lost.

535
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:00,200
Well, when you put it like that...

536
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:02,360
I sent cameron to get a cake.

537
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,790
What do you want for dinner?

538
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,290
Well, not to insult
your cooking or anything,

539
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:09,610
but do you mind if we went out?

540
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,690
Yeah, we can do that.

541
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:15,240
All right, let me shut this down.

542
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:22,720
What? What's the matter?

543
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,830
The guy that derek killed...

544
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:26,900
In the alley.

545
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:28,330
Sarkissian.

546
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:31,140
I don't think that was sarkissian.
