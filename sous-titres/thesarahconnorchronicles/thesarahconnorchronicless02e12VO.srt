1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,380
It's 217,yeah,I am here.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:03,980
Who are you?

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:06,430
You are hunting it

4
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:08,999
How do you know it's not hunting you?

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:11,750
Hello

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,860
Hello,Sarah

7
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,240
We are breaking up.Hello?

8
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,020
Easy,easy,easy

9
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,770
Sarah Connor sent me.Ok?

10
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:53,910
I'm here to help

11
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:57,390
Sorry,I thought

12
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,910
I know you thought,you'd be dead already.

13
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:04,770
How far along

14
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,270
34 weeks

15
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,640
It's been thorough and through

16
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,270
I just need to put the tube in.

17
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,240
Just hold her still. And you stay still also.

18
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:23,120
I'm fine,Ok?I'm fine.

19
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,040
Ready?

20
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,210
What's on?What happened?

21
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,720
That thing

22
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,490
Cyborg

23
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,930
It's been tracking us for 6 months

24
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,090
How did it find you?

25
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,730
How did you know Sarah?


27
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,470
We don't live in a barn

28
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,400
we close the door and we wipe our feet.

29
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,360
They are alive.

30
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,300
Are you the Fields?

31
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,001
Go to your room and lock the door

32
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,510
What do you want?

33
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,700
I'm here to help.Are you the Fields?

34
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,330
-Anne,call 911 -No,no,please

35
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,570
Go get the girl back

36
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,940
I need to get you outta here now.Someone's coming.

37
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,260
I'm not here to rob you.

38
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,900
Then put down the gun.

39
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,780
You don't understand you are in danger

40
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:32,590
We need to go.

41
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,660
Just stand there.

42
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,200
We had a hit on a name on the list.

43
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,491
Alpine Fields,it's a family

44
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,670
Everything is under control.We might be late though.

45
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,950
Can you handle your dinner?

46
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,780
John,just put the alarm on

47
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,260
Teenagers,huh?

48
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,660
Don't move.

49
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,250
Put the gun down.

50
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,020
Who are you?

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,160
What are you doing here?

52
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,740
Tell me the truth.

53
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,590
The truth.

54
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,400
In the near future,

55
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,260
A computer system called Skynet takes over the world

56
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,460
It's sent humanoid machines back in time

57
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,070
To eliminate anyone who is a threat

58
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,390
I have a target list.Your name's on it

59
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,540
A machine is coming to kill you.

60
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,250
It found your house in the city,and now it's coming here.

61
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,000
And your house sitter is dead by the way.

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,800
Call the police

63
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,491
Tell them there's a crazy woman in the house with a gun

64
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,800
You.

65
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,900
Stand over here with her.

66
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,260
Okay,we're going. now.

67
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,360
Now.

68
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,530
What about charles barkley?

69
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:09,500
no.

70
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,800
Why would you keep a gun in the house?

71
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,700
For a situation like this.

72
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,830
Or a bear.

73
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:20,130
This wouldn't work in a situation like this.

74
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,200
Why didn't you tell me?

75
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,600
Or a bear.

76
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Because I knew you'd react like this,

77
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,860
And this is not helping.

78
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,730
Does your son know you kidnap people at gunpoint?

79
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,360
Yes.

80
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,830
Then you know he'll be prone to delinquency himself.

81
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,700
Mom,I think it's obvious she's well beyond dr. phil.

82
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,860
Hey,you know,this is none of your business.

83
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,900
Sarah.

84
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,860
Out!

85
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,830
Back to the cabin,now!

86
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,530
go,run,run!

87
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,330
I'm sorry.

88
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,200
You should keep that covered.

89
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,960
It's a st. jude's medal. it's my grandmother's.

90
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,060
It's a target.

91
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:37,860
Where'd you get it?

92
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,860
One of them.

93
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,100
Do I wanna know?

94
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,730
Not really.

95
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:52,560
You sound so used to all this.

96
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,800
You don't get used to it.

97
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,630
You live through it.

98
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,360
You sound like david.

99
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:05,000
We were outside a motel in elko when it found us.

100
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,830
Dad emptied the mossberg into that thing.

101
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,030
And then he went after it with a table lamp

102
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,430
And a curtain rod.

103
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:14,360
Just long enough for us to get out.

104
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,560
She told us to call if it came back.

105
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,200
Do you think david could be all right?

106
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,030
Anything's possible.

107
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,330
What?

108
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,800
Nothing.

109
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,100
I just know that look.


111
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,180
Your plan sucks.

112
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,350
You can't use metal for this.

113
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,580
They hit eagle rock bunker with a bio-weapon

114
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,950
That killed everybody inside.

115
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,580
Only one person survived out of 200.

116
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,280
Now,we need her back here.

117
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,680
Alive.

118
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,910
Metal's immune to disease,

119
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,080
So we're sending in metal,end of story.

120
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,280
Tin cans are immune to disease

121
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,680
But not immune to going bad and putting a bullet

122
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,610
In the skull of a person out there who could save us from this plague.

123
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,980
I'll find the survivor.

124
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:01,650
I'll bring her back.

125
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,280
Just hope like hell she can help us.

126
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,580
Once exposed,there's no way to know how long you've got.

127
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,780
Could be four hours till the symptoms hit.

128
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,650
20 before the bug kills you.

129
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,500
This could be a one-way trip.

130
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,350
We're all on one-way trips.

131
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,380
He's not out there,you know.

132
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,380
Your brother kyle.

133
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,150
He's gone,reese.

134
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:29,850
Now either you learn to live with that,

135
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:30,850
Or die from it.

136
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,410
She's sleeping now.

137
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,950
So you wanna tell me how it found you?

138
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,150
It's best if I know.

139
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,680
It was my fat.t.

140
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,610
I used the phone.

141
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:26,550
I called a friend. roger.

142
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:30,550
I guess...

143
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:34,150
I needed to feel normal,you know.

144
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,250
Like a person.

145
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,380
So you broke the rules.

146
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,510
Yeah.

147
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:49,080
The rule NO.1 is,there is no normal.

148
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,150
Down,down,down.

149
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,780
I think I messed up my ankle.

150
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:59,310
What the hell was that?

151
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,610
The thing from the future I mentioned.

152
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,880
We need to get him to a hospital.

153
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,210
We need to call the police.

154
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:09,610
No,you call the police,

155
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,050
Police come,that thing kills them.

156
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,050
I need tape.

157
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,050
Then we have to get out of here.

158
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,150
Your car's outside.

159
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,580
We can just take your car,and we can--

160
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,280
The road's blocked. it's out there.

161
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,550
We won't be going that way.

162
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,480
Is there another road out of here?

163
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,380
No.

164
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,080
Schaeffer's got a road.

165
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,510
But it's a mile through the woods,

166
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,810
And I don't think he's there.

167
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,550
Can you stand?

168
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:41,580
Barely.

169
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:43,980
Leave me.

170
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,150
Head for schaeffer's place.

171
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,250
See if you can get down that way.

172
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,450
david,we're a mess.

173
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,610
We can't run a mile through the woods.

174
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,210
No one gets left behind.

175
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,450
What about your daughter?

176
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,110
She's not my daughter.

177
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,650
She's one of them from the future.

178
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,680
No freaking way.

179
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,750
She's on our side.

180
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,680
I need to know which one of you that thing is after.

181
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,780
What do you mean,which one?

182
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,750
That thing wants one of you dead.

183
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,550
I need to know why.

184
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,510
Either of you deal with computers,

185
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,150
Technology,the military,anything like that?

186
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,810
I'm a banker.

187
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,080
She's a housewife.

188
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,210
She's nothing.

189
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,250
hey!

190
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,250
you know what I mean.

191
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,410
it's a mistake.

192
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:19,750
We're normal people.

193
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,110
Here. do you want your oxy,honey?

194
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,780
I have a bulging disk.

195
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,780
L-4.

196
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,210
Look,

197
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:31,950
We don't know what we did.

198
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,080
All right,we can't help you.

199
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,410
I'm sorry.

200
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,050
What's this door handle made of?

201
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:39,110
It's oil-rubbed copper.

202
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,080
Why?

203
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,610
I wanted to see if I could help.

204
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:12,610
You can look for flashlights.

205
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,910
What are you going to do?

206
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,850
I'm gonna set a trap.

207
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:24,150
You have any hole saw bits?

208
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,650
A metal cylinder with teeth?

209
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:28,680
Uh,like for making holes for birdhouses?

210
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,910
I don't know.

211
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,010
I don't make birdhouses.

212
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:33,610
Me and my dad have made a million.

213
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:34,550
We're still waiting for

214
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,150
our first bird family to move in.

215
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:38,080
That sounds so lame,right?

216
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,980
Why would that sound lame?

217
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,110
Because you're running around with guns,

218
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,150
Fighting robots.

219
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:45,410
Cybernetic organisms.

220
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:46,750
The outside is very real.

221
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,210
You're fighting cyborgs,

222
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,880
And we're building birdhouses.

223
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,180
I'd trade for birdhouses any time.

224
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,550
What's it like?

225
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,180
I mean...

226
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,080
Doing what you do.

227
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,750
It must be--

228
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,980
Why'd you come out here?

229
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,310
You stand there like you're gonna tell me a secret,

230
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:13,550
But you don't.

231
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,850
My son does that.

232
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:18,280
You really do this?With a kid?

233
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,710
He's why I do this.

234
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,710
Is that it?

235
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:33,010
It's my dad.

236
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,250
There's sothingg he's not telling you.

237
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:43,110
Sym dyne.tell me about it

238
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,980
Sym dyne cybernetics,a company

239
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,110
You've been working with.

240
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,480
Cybernetics?

241
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,750
What are you talking about?

242
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,080
David?

243
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,280
Computers,cyborgs,the future.

244
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,780
Your husband's been holding out.

245
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:59,450
Okay,yeah.

246
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:01,110
A tech company's one of my clients.

247
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,450
These are the emails.

248
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,980
This is what I asked you for.

249
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,980
Why didn't you tell me?

250
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,680
It's just business.

251
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,350
It doesn't have anything to do with robots.

252
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,050
It's cyborgs.

253
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,050
What were you doing?

254
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,910
Business.

255
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,410
Banking.

256
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:20,480
Why do you need to know?

257
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,610
Because I'm not here just to be nice

258
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,510
And help your nice family.

259
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,780
I'm trying to stop the end of the world from happening

260
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,250
And save my family.

261
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,180
So I need to know what skynet's doing

262
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,450
And why they'd want you dead.

263
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:34,780
Why don't you just tell her,david?

264
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,710
Because it's not exactly legal.

265
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,750
Okay?

266
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,410
why didn't you tell me,david?

267
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:53,280
What part of secret and illegal do you not understand?

268
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:56,350
So this was an actual crime?

269
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:58,280
Oh,come on,and what are you doing on my computer?

270
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,580
Looking at lesbian porn.

271
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,880
What's the difference?

272
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,050
You're gay?

273
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,850
lauren?

274
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:04,980
God,people.

275
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,710
No!

276
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,180
Thanks for knowing me.

277
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,850
Well,I'm sorry,but apparently,

278
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:13,610
Your father is suddenly some sort of criminal mastermind.

279
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:15,180
anne,you have no idea--

280
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,180
is any of this real?

281
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,180
Quiet!

282
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,180
This is very real.

283
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,950
What is it?

284
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,210
Is something happening?

285
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:31,950
They're hunting.

286
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,380
Hunting what?

287
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,450
Each other.

288
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,310
So are we safe?

289
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:46,310
No one is ever safe.

290
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:49,480
I'm sorry.

291
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,210
-I need some air. -you know how to use this?

292
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,610
If you do,take it.

293
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:57,750
If you don't,leave it.

294
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,310
You don't go outside without it.


296
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:40,380
Hello?

297
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,550
Hello!

298
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,080
Excuse me.

299
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,480
Your fly's open.

300
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:20,450
Sorry.

301
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:22,880
This keeps reopening.

302
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,250
You need to lie still.

303
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,680
Where is she?

304
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,150
Where is lauren?

305
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:31,910
She went out for some air.

306
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:32,910
You let her?

307
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:35,210
With that thing out there?

308
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:37,150
Your kid'll be fine.

309
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:41,050
Lauren,she hasn't been a kid for months.

310
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:42,550
It's easy to think,

311
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:45,810
It's easy to say.

312
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:47,010
It's not always so.

313
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:49,980
What do you know about it?

314
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:53,150
I know she's protecting you.

315
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:57,480
I know that story she told me

316
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,610
About calling that roger guy was crap.

317
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,880
She's too smart to call anybody.

318
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:06,410
But somebody called roger.

319
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:10,010
And I'm guessing it was you.

320
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,950
Kids can adapt to all this.

321
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:16,580
It's harder for adults.

322
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:21,010
Is it necessary to destroy the entire house completely.

323
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,080
David,you got us into this.

324
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,310
Let her do her job.

325
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,680
What can I do?

326
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,210
In the bag. give me a black tape.

327
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,680
You never asked where the money came from.

328
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,150
I assumed you were earning it.

329
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,480
Oh,now what?

330
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,050
I'm going to the bathroom.

331
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,310
Is that okay?

332
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,550
What'll that do?

333
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:46,010
There's a chip in their head.

334
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,250
Shock'll trigger reboot.

335
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,250
If one of them touches this door handle,

336
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,080
We have two minutes to get the chip out.

337
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,210
Does that work?

338
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:54,950
I've only tried it on the girl.

339
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:59,110
And,no,it doesn't always work.

340
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,950
So what guarantees he comes through the front door?

341
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:04,510
They always come through the front door.

342
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:15,680
I didn't know the lights worked.

343
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,150
I switched the breakers back.

344
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,210
Who are you calling?

345
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,610
No one. sorry. I'm--

346
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:23,880
I'm just checking the phone line.

347
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,280
I'm scared.

348
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,280
Hawaii.

349
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,450
Yes.

350
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:30,180
Are you married?

351
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,510
To your son's--

352
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,950
No. barely knew him.

353
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:34,950
Lucky you.

354
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,950
You think you're getting this.

355
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,580
Then you realize you got that.

356
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,910
Don't worry about the past.

357
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:43,210
It's easy for you to say.

358
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:45,350
I'm not like you.

359
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,550
I'm just normal.

360
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:49,480
I was normal.

361
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,050
All this I had to learn.

362
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:54,610
I thought crisis was supposed to bring a family closer.

363
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:59,310
Don't confuse close with happy.

364
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,450
hey,I see something.

365
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,550
I saw something. I think someone's coming.

366
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,550
Get back from the window.

367
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,780
It's not her. it's a man.

368
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,510
I think it's mr. schaeffer.

369
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,780
Who?

370
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,880
It's roger from the next property over.

371
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,610
It's okay. we know him.

372
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,380
these things can look like anyone.

373
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,080
Friends,neighbors.

374
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,680
I told roger we were camping this weekend.

375
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,110
charles!

376
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:29,980
-Dogs can smell these things. -no,it's him.

377
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,080
What would he be doing here?

378
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,680
-That's him. -how could you know?

379
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,050
The shock will kill him.

380
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:35,080
-I know it's him. -wait.

381
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,680
Hey,annie. roger,get inside!

382
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,650
He's coming to see me,okay?

383
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,310
She never goes camping.

384
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,450
She keeps the home fires going.

385
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,380
With roger?

386
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:59,350
Don't confuse close with happy.

387
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:05,610
I know it was stupid.

388
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:11,610
But I needed...to let him know.

389
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:13,610
And now he's dead.

390
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:18,380
And david is dead.

391
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,710
I know he is.

392
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,480
I had no idea what happy was.

393
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,680
It's funny the things you say to yourself.

394
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,750
Oh,I've seen worse.

395
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:34,810
It'll be fine.

396
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:36,980
Can't happen to me.

397
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:41,010
But the worst is always out there,isn't it?

398
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,480
And it can happen to you.

399
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,180
And it isn't fine.

400
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:59,310
Even after everything,she's still trying to...Cover for me.

401
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,510
Protect my dignity,I guess.

402
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:05,010
She needs it to be normal.

403
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,980
She needs to be good.

404
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:15,480
Or seem that way.

405
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,710
All right...

406
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:20,450
No more talking,okay?

407
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:22,910
It's gonna get your heart rate up.

408
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,150
It's not good.

409
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:26,680
It doesn't matter.

410
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,580
Lauren matters.

411
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,850
And this baby matters.

412
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:34,080
They're all that's gonna be left of me after this is over.

413
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,810
A mother knows.

414
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,930
You the one?

415
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:00,300
Who sent the signal?

416
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,400
No.

417
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,060
My shore party picked up a coded s.o.s.about 45 ticks back.

418
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,960
Sent me to fossick around.

419
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,360
What's that in english?

420
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,130
It means someone's still alive inside.

421
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:17,400
Probably a civilian.

422
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,600
Probably hiding.

423
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,130
Radio room,I'm guessing.

424
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,560
I didn't go in that far.

425
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,560
What'd you say about a shore party?

426
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:35,200
Making troop and supply runs back and forth from perth for months.

427
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,400
Seawolf sub.

428
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,500
The jimmy carter.

429
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,360
You've got a nuclear sub?

430
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,630
Who drives it?

431
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:48,100
Not who. what.

432
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,200
We got a scrubbed triple eight for a captain.

433
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,330
You've got metal running the sub.

434
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,360
Well,you find me a sub commander

435
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,360
Who survived j-day,I'll switch him in.

436
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,600
Have a little faith,mate.

437
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,830
She'll be apples.

438
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:12,700
Means we'll be all right.

439
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,730
You believe that?

440
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:17,960
Sure as my mother loves me.

441
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,560
My mother's dead.

442
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,660
Here.

443
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:24,030
Gas?

444
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,230
Bugs.

445
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:26,330
This gonna work?

446
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:28,800
Probably not.

447
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,360
Come on. come on.

448
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,730
We need to get her to a hospital.

449
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:44,400
This isn't like last time.

450
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,960
It's not gonna happen.

451
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,660
She needs a doctor.

452
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,700
A real doctor.

453
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,400
She needs you to keep it together.

454
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,800
Oh,yeah,who put you in charge?

455
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,360
You did. just now.

456
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,060
Until sarah connor comes through that door,

457
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,860
The safest place in the whole damn world is right here.

458
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,160
They can't kill it.

459
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,630
They couldn't kill it before.

460
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:06,430
They can't kill it now.

461
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:07,830
Baby. my baby. I'm sorry.

462
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:15,360
When did this whole affair thing start?

463
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,760
You want to talk about this now?

464
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,230
Was it last summer when I couldn't travel because of my back accident?

465
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,760
You have a bulging disk from sleeping on your stomach.

466
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,300
I slipped and fell!

467
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,300
You have a weak core!

468
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,500
Well at least my core isn't a slut.

469
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,200
Hophead.

470
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,000
Whore!

471
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,860
Okay,that is your wife. don't you.

472
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:31,860
Damn it.

473
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,130
The fuses are fried.

474
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:38,630
Not sure I can get the power rerouted.

475
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:40,530
And who is this again?

476
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:41,630
Sarah.

477
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:43,300
She saved our lives.

478
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,400
From a guy who looks like a guy but is a robot?

479
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,400
It's real,roger.

480
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,530
A real man,maybe,but anne...

481
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:49,560
Robots?

482
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,560
Hey,the correct term

483
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,230
Is cyborg.

484
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,960
roger?

485
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,900
Did you drive here?

486
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,700
No,but I got the 540 at my place.

487
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,330
A mile away and we're out of here.

488
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:03,660
in our condition,

489
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,100
With that thing out there,we'll never make it.

490
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,400
Fine,david.

491
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,330
I'll carry you.

492
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:10,100
You have no idea what you're talking about.

493
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,600
Oh,right,right. the cyborgs.

494
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,130
Anne?

495
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:15,060
Look at me.

496
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,230
She's a crazy woman.

497
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:18,030
And this guy out in the woods

498
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,800
Is probably her meth-head boyfriend or something.

499
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,030
This is what we're going to do.

500
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,700
You're gonna come with me to my place.

501
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,830
We'll head into town--

502
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,930
get everyone fixed up.

503
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:27,760
Then we'll talk all this through like adults.

504
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,160
What the hell is that?

505
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,130
It's one of those things.

506
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:40,560
Is it dead?

507
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,660
I hope not.

508
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,300
This is a good one. is she?

509
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,260
I don't think so.

510
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,260
Can you turn her back on?

511
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,900
It's coming.

512
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,660
Roger!

513
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,230
Roger!

514
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:08,860
David,what are you doing?

515
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,630
I'm the one it wants. somebody's got to do something.

516
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:11,900
Can't let you do that.

517
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,960
Lady...

518
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,300
I don't give a damn about skynet

519
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,330
Or whatever the hell it is you're selling.

520
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:20,900
I'm trying to save my family.

521
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,760
So let me go out there and do it,

522
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,200
Or I'll do it right here.

523
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,800
Daddy!

524
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,130
I'm sorry...

525
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,530
For everything.

526
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,160
Hey,I'm david fields,the one you want.

527
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,200
Take me. leave my family.



530
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,560
It's not him.

531
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,000
It's after one of you.

532
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,300
Someone's not telling me something.

533
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,930
I can't help you both run.

534
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:13,200
Anne.

535
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,900
David doesn't know.

536
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,130
It's not his.

537
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:19,930
You're pregnant?

538
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:21,100
Okay,go.

539
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,230
Stay in here. don't make a sound.

540
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:25,060
I'm gonna help your mom get to roger's car.

541
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,930
Wait,no,you can't.

542
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:28,330
It's after you.

543
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:29,730
She'll be safe here.

544
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,500
Mom,I get it. I'll be okay.

545
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,900
You sure?

546
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,600
I mean,I'd rather be making birdhouses.

547
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,160
Me too.

548
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,400
Ok,Anne,Let's go.

549
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,360
I did this to you.

550
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,900
I'm sorry.

551
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,300
What is this about?

552
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,760
You don't know what this is about?

553
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,930
This is about your mother

554
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:54,660
And your baby sister.

555
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,500
And they need you right now.

556
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,560
My baby sister?

557
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,760
How do you--

558
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,960
Oh,god. you're from the future.

559
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:10,130
Your sister's name is sydney.

560
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,700
And I knew her.

561
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:22,230
Those gas masks,they won't help.

562
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,630
You're already infected.

563
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,700
Sun's up.

564
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,630
We can't move out till nightfall.

565
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:34,330
That's when the tin can switch to infrared.

566
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:37,830
Guess we'll just have to sit it out and wait.

567
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:41,760
When we get to serrano point,they can cure this thing?

568
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,400
Let's just get to serrano first.

569
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,260
What is this?

570
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,330
it's plumpy'nut.

571
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:50,260
It's peanut butter mixed with baby formula

572
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,800
And vitamin powder.

573
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,830
Slept on top of a pallet of it on the trip over from perth.

574
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,700
You guys are growing food again?

575
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:01,030
Yep. beats chasing rabbits.

576
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,400
Rabbits?

577
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,100
Thought australia was all wombats

578
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,360
And wallabies and stuff.

579
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,960
No.

580
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,000
Some wacko brought 'em over in the 1800s.

581
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,360
We've been overrunitith em ever since.

582
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,000
Tried everything to kill the things.

583
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,760
Trapped 'em,shot 'em,poisoned them,

584
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,730
Built a fence across half the country

585
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:24,860
To keep 'em out.

586
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:28,060
In the 1950s,they even introduced a virus

587
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,500
To wipe 'em out forever.

588
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,960
It killed most of 'em,but a couple were immune,

589
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,400
So ten years later,

590
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,530
Oz was up to its eyeballs in rabbits again.

591
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,360
Tough little bastards.

592
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,100
At's why you have to cook 'em longer.

593
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,900
Can you pass me your water? I'm parched.

594
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:06,000
Let's go.

595
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,430
In broad daylight?

596
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:10,000
Just 'cause you're death-crazy

597
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,660
Doesn't mean we've enlisted.

598
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:17,260
it starts with a dry mouth.

599
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:21,760
And then the sweats.

600
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,300
And the fever and shaking starts.

601
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:27,600
And then your lungs fill up with fluid,

602
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,630
And then you die.

603
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:30,630
You don't have much time.

604
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:34,730
It's coming.

605
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:37,400
Let's go.

606
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:51,000
So you're from the future?

607
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,630
Like them?

608
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,430
Like those machines?

609
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:55,630
Yeah.

610
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:57,300
Yeah,like them.

611
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:01,330
And in the future,you know my baby.

612
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:04,300
So does that mean she makes it?

613
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:08,530
Your daughter sydney has an immunity.

614
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:11,230
In her blood.

615
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:13,500
She helps us cure a deadly disease.

616
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:18,330
She saves a lot of lives.

617
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:19,600
Sydney.

618
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:26,030
And lauren?

619
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,430
Does she save her too?

620
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,060
He's human?

621
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,600
Yes,of course!

622
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,830
My mistake.

623
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,760
Come on,come on. get in!

624
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,200
Go around. go around!

625
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,030
She's fully dilated.

626
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,600
You have to do this,baby.

627
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:04,060
You have to do this.

628
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,200
My sister's coming.

629
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,510
You know what oscar wilde's last words were?

630
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,250
Either the wallpaper goes,

631
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:25,780
Or I do.

632
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,910
I thought it would be over by now.

633
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:36,550
You're ready for it.

634
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:38,950
No.

635
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:42,280
No,I'm not.

636
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,410
Then what were you doing when I found you

637
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:45,310
Outside eagle rock?

638
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:53,280
I think...

639
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,910
I was waiting for you.

640
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:35,310
Thank you for saving my sister.

641
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:48,380
I've been where you are.

642
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:52,510
There are days when you don't think you can go on,

643
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:55,950
But you will.

644
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:57,380
Because she needs you to.

645
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:02,580
Wela do.

646
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,980
But even if they kill that thing,

647
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:08,180
There's more,aren't there?

648
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,880
Does it ever end?

649
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:15,310
I don't know.

650
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:20,180
We're trying.

651
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:26,910
Come stay with us.

652
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:29,710
I don't know.

653
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:31,750
Think about it.

654
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:36,180
I have to do this.

655
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:04,010
Did you get it?

656
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:05,950
I an,when this happened to you,

657
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:06,980
How long until you knew

658
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,680
Everything was gonna be different?

659
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,950
Right away.

660
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,780
I don't know if they get it.

661
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:17,350
They'll need your help.

662
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:20,050
They always have.

663
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:38,380
Sarah,hey.

664
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:40,280
Yeah,I'm still here.

665
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,480
Did you get the triple eight?

666
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:44,650
Are you sure?

667
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:47,410
I got this,I'm pretty sure.

668
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:50,350
Um,baby's fine.

669
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:54,780
Girl's a tough kid.

670
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:57,880
I told her she could come stay with us.

671
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:01,280
Well,it can't get much worse,can it?

672
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:05,850
Yeah. yeah,call me when you get back.

673
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:14,780
Lauren,i...
