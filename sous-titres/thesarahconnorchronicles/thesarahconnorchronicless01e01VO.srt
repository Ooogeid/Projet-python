1
00:00:08,461 --> 00:00:11,805
<i>There are those who believe that a child
in her womb shares his mother's dreams.</i>

2
00:00:13,366 --> 00:00:16,284
<i>Her love for him.</i>
<i>Her hopes for his future.</i>

3
00:00:17,055 --> 00:00:19,312
<i>Is it told to him in pictures
while he sleeps inside her?</i>

4
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,646
<i>Is that why he reaches for her
in that first moment</i>

5
00:00:22,766 --> 00:00:24,152
<i>and cries for her touch?</i>

6
00:00:25,203 --> 00:00:28,705
<i>But what if you'd known since he was
inside you what his life held for him?</i>

7
00:00:29,318 --> 00:00:30,606
<i>That he would be hunted.</i>

8
00:00:30,726 --> 00:00:32,827
<i>That his fate was tied
to the fate of millions.</i>

9
00:00:33,407 --> 00:00:36,824
<i>That every moment of your life
will be spent keeping him alive.</i>

10
00:00:37,406 --> 00:00:39,940
<i>Would he understand
why you were so hard?</i>

11
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,136
<i>Why you held on so tight?</i>

12
00:00:42,452 --> 00:00:44,269
<i>Will he still reach for you
if the only dream</i>

13
00:00:44,389 --> 00:00:46,091
<i>you ever shared
with him was a nightmare?</i>

14
00:00:51,931 --> 00:00:55,100
<i>Would he know my love
runs through him like blood?</i>

15
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,727
John, now.

16
00:00:58,681 --> 00:00:59,353
Now!

17
00:01:06,038 --> 00:01:08,228
- The cops make you at the diner?
- I don't know.

18
00:01:08,348 --> 00:01:09,781
Maybe.

19
00:01:13,903 --> 00:01:16,037
Yes. Definitely.

20
00:01:16,825 --> 00:01:18,456
<i>Sarah Connor! John Connor!</i>

21
00:01:18,865 --> 00:01:20,111
<i>Drop what you're carrying.</i>

22
00:01:20,752 --> 00:01:22,484
<i>Put your hands on your head</i>

23
00:01:22,604 --> 00:01:23,878
<i>and kneel on the ground.</i>

24
00:01:24,665 --> 00:01:25,565
<i>Now!</i>

25
00:02:03,433 --> 00:02:04,843
Do me a favor, will you?

26
00:02:05,331 --> 00:02:06,296
Fix it.

27
00:02:37,612 --> 00:02:39,245
<i>Drop your weapon!</i>

28
00:02:54,253 --> 00:02:55,094
Move!

29
00:03:07,934 --> 00:03:10,068
You run! Run!

30
00:03:36,627 --> 00:03:37,857
John!

31
00:03:38,472 --> 00:03:40,034
John. John.

32
00:03:40,396 --> 00:03:41,432
John.

33
00:03:46,344 --> 00:03:47,328
John?

34
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:48,737
John?

35
00:03:52,283 --> 00:03:53,005
Do it!

36
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:57,282
Do it! Kill me! Nothing matters anymore.

37
00:03:58,753 --> 00:04:00,118
Kill me!

38
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,685
You're right.

39
00:04:02,703 --> 00:04:04,706
Nothing matters anymore.

40
00:04:04,866 --> 00:04:06,226
Only the boy.

41
00:04:06,722 --> 00:04:08,166
The future's ours.

42
00:04:08,328 --> 00:04:10,670
And it begins now.

43
00:04:43,385 --> 00:04:45,185
Did you scream or something?

44
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:47,506
Scream? No.

45
00:04:52,005 --> 00:04:53,221
Go back to sleep.

46
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,703
I can't. Got an early shift.

47
00:05:02,264 --> 00:05:03,513
Are you all right?

48
00:05:04,314 --> 00:05:05,667
I'm good.

49
00:05:05,954 --> 00:05:07,185
- Yeah?
- I'm great.

50
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,350
Well, you damn well better be.

51
00:05:10,318 --> 00:05:13,566
You know, the guy down at the store
told me any woman would be lucky

52
00:05:14,573 --> 00:05:15,652
to have this ring.

53
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,957
He doesn't know the giver like I do.

54
00:05:24,207 --> 00:05:25,638
You wanna know a secret?

55
00:05:26,235 --> 00:05:28,176
I don't know. I don't like secrets.

56
00:05:28,296 --> 00:05:30,431
No? This is a good one.

57
00:05:30,551 --> 00:05:31,890
- Really?
- Yeah.

58
00:05:32,764 --> 00:05:33,817
All right.

59
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,361
John picked it out.

60
00:05:39,043 --> 00:05:39,918
Sort of.

61
00:05:41,024 --> 00:05:43,524
You know I'd been looking
and looking and I...

62
00:05:43,644 --> 00:05:45,951
kinda starting freaking myself out
with the whole color

63
00:05:46,071 --> 00:05:47,475
and cut and clarity...

64
00:05:47,635 --> 00:05:50,687
So you turned the job over
to a 15-year-old boy.

65
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,247
You think I'm a jackass, don't you?

66
00:05:57,118 --> 00:05:58,797
I'm thinking I love you.

67
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:17,248
Always rember that.

68
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,680
Early shift.

69
00:06:27,627 --> 00:06:29,343
- Better get going.
- Right.

70
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,234
Early shift.

71
00:06:36,717 --> 00:06:37,538
Bye.

72
00:06:46,485 --> 00:06:50,801
Season 1 Episode 1
Pilot (v. 1.00)

73
00:06:50,921 --> 00:06:52,355
http://Projet-SG.net

74
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,136
Mom, how many times have I told you

75
00:07:05,296 --> 00:07:07,221
it's freaky when you do that?

76
00:07:07,381 --> 00:07:08,848
I'm sorry.

77
00:07:16,471 --> 00:07:17,648
What's going on?

78
00:07:22,989 --> 00:07:24,636
We can't stay here, John.

79
00:07:25,852 --> 00:07:26,699
What?

80
00:07:27,558 --> 00:07:28,785
It's not safe.

81
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:31,908
Not safe from who?

82
00:07:32,248 --> 00:07:33,289
No one knows us.

83
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:36,125
No one asks questions.
It's been almost two years.

84
00:07:36,285 --> 00:07:38,058
School starts in, like, three weeks.

85
00:07:38,222 --> 00:07:40,379
- We need to go.
- No, you need to go.

86
00:07:40,758 --> 00:07:43,065
You're scared. He gave you a ring
and now you're freaking out.

87
00:07:43,185 --> 00:07:44,342
I know you like him.

88
00:07:44,502 --> 00:07:45,550
So do you, mom!

89
00:07:46,187 --> 00:07:48,304
So do you. You love him, I know you do.

90
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:52,099
Listen to me.
The cops will never find us. We're safe.

91
00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:55,394
Don't you think that, John!

92
00:07:55,719 --> 00:07:58,271
Don't you ever think that. Look at me!

93
00:07:58,692 --> 00:08:00,656
No one is ever safe.

94
00:08:09,684 --> 00:08:10,701
Half an hour.

95
00:08:11,989 --> 00:08:13,053
One bag.

96
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:14,962
Plus the guns.

97
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:17,321
I'll make pancakes.

98
00:08:29,964 --> 00:08:31,802
<i>Every family has rules.</i>

99
00:08:32,466 --> 00:08:33,779
<i>And we had ours.</i>

100
00:08:34,256 --> 00:08:35,634
<i>Keep your head down,</i>

101
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:37,120
<i>keep your eyes up,</i>

102
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,489
<i>resist the urge to be seen
as important or special.</i>

103
00:08:43,325 --> 00:08:44,712
<i>Know your exits.</i>

104
00:08:48,566 --> 00:08:50,747
I mean, she's not
exactly missing, right?

105
00:08:50,867 --> 00:08:52,410
- The way you explain it.
- Right.

106
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,679
The way I explained it,
she's not missing.

107
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:55,663
She left.

108
00:08:56,185 --> 00:08:57,540
Happens more than you think.

109
00:08:57,701 --> 00:08:59,021
You don't know her.

110
00:08:59,436 --> 00:09:01,639
I can say the same to you, Mr. Dixon.

111
00:09:04,239 --> 00:09:04,948
FBI?

112
00:09:06,454 --> 00:09:07,508
Been together long?

113
00:09:08,226 --> 00:09:10,595
Six months, maybe. Bit of a whirlwind.

114
00:09:11,976 --> 00:09:13,681
You have no idea, the whirlwind.

115
00:09:14,103 --> 00:09:15,183
Tell me,

116
00:09:15,343 --> 00:09:18,003
does the Skynet defense system
mean anything to you?

117
00:09:20,647 --> 00:09:21,396
No.

118
00:09:22,502 --> 00:09:23,988
How about this guy?

119
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:25,985
Miles Dyson.

120
00:09:26,145 --> 00:09:27,177
No.

121
00:09:27,297 --> 00:09:28,446
Never seen him before.

122
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,031
That's because he's dead.

123
00:09:30,793 --> 00:09:34,223
Your fiancee, freshly escaped
from the pescadero mental hospital,

124
00:09:34,403 --> 00:09:36,005
blew him apart two years ago.

125
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:38,501
Leveled a four story
research lab along with him.

126
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:40,458
But since there's no lethal injection

127
00:09:40,618 --> 00:09:42,460
for the destruction of property,

128
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,246
let's just stick with the murder of

129
00:09:44,413 --> 00:09:46,631
one of our county's brightest
computer scientists. And...

130
00:09:48,084 --> 00:09:49,717
dedicated family man.

131
00:09:51,397 --> 00:09:53,325
That's... it's just not...

132
00:09:54,506 --> 00:09:56,285
Why would she do that?

133
00:09:56,743 --> 00:09:58,569
Well, you know, Mr. Dixon.

134
00:09:59,251 --> 00:10:00,519
It's the robots.

135
00:10:02,964 --> 00:10:04,434
The ones from the future.

136
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,818
The ones Skynet sent to kill her son.

137
00:10:08,828 --> 00:10:10,537
Which makes total sense.

138
00:10:10,657 --> 00:10:13,282
Because, in the future,
John's not only her son, but...

139
00:10:13,442 --> 00:10:14,617
What does it say here?

140
00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:16,661
"The leader of the resistance

141
00:10:16,821 --> 00:10:19,163
fighting artificially
intelligent machines

142
00:10:19,323 --> 00:10:22,123
determined to annihilate
the human race."

143
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:26,279
Did he strike you that way?

144
00:10:27,253 --> 00:10:29,153
Leader of a scrappy band of rebels?

145
00:10:29,273 --> 00:10:30,508
Luke Skywalker type?

146
00:10:31,111 --> 00:10:32,293
He's just a kid.

147
00:10:32,989 --> 00:10:35,012
He's a great kid.
He was like a son to me.

148
00:10:39,207 --> 00:10:40,851
I came down here for help.

149
00:10:42,012 --> 00:10:43,687
You can't really be asking me this!

150
00:10:44,193 --> 00:10:44,897
No.

151
00:10:45,309 --> 00:10:46,260
I'm not.

152
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:49,527
This is just my patter, Mr. Dixon.

153
00:10:50,064 --> 00:10:51,699
This is just me impressing upon you

154
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:54,115
that I'm not here
because you lost your fiancee.

155
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,367
Love of your life
and all-around good time girl.

156
00:10:56,527 --> 00:10:59,120
I'm here because my boss,
the United States of America,

157
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,871
thinks Sarah Connor is a deluded...

158
00:11:01,031 --> 00:11:02,603
Dangerous grade "A" whack-a-mole

159
00:11:02,723 --> 00:11:05,252
who killed a man because she believes
that in the future he'll invent

160
00:11:05,372 --> 00:11:08,296
a computer system
that declares war on the world.

161
00:11:09,412 --> 00:11:10,965
So let's begin with her name.

162
00:11:14,211 --> 00:11:15,678
I understand it's not Connor.

163
00:12:08,107 --> 00:12:10,238
<i>You'll be responsible
for three chapters a week.</i>

164
00:12:10,358 --> 00:12:11,954
<i>You have a quiz each friday.</i>

165
00:12:12,074 --> 00:12:14,708
<i>You're allowed one make-up test
with a parent's note.</i>

166
00:12:15,482 --> 00:12:16,895
What's your name?

167
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,825
John.

168
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,035
Cameron.

169
00:12:22,488 --> 00:12:23,496
And no talking...

170
00:12:23,656 --> 00:12:25,018
while I'm talking.

171
00:12:32,631 --> 00:12:33,506
John?

172
00:12:34,892 --> 00:12:36,773
I haven't seen you around here before.

173
00:12:36,977 --> 00:12:39,646
- Did you just move here?
- Yeah, I did.

174
00:12:40,032 --> 00:12:41,396
Sucks for you.

175
00:12:43,342 --> 00:12:44,874
My dad sells tractors.

176
00:12:44,994 --> 00:12:47,317
- What about yours?
- Insurance.

177
00:12:47,437 --> 00:12:48,646
Really? What kind?

178
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,400
The boring kind.

179
00:12:53,438 --> 00:12:55,653
Those are the kind of tractors
my dad sells.

180
00:12:55,813 --> 00:12:57,283
What about your mom?

181
00:12:58,543 --> 00:12:59,657
My mom stays home.

182
00:13:01,372 --> 00:13:04,620
You know, I really gotta get
to the next class, so...

183
00:13:05,698 --> 00:13:06,816
So...

184
00:13:07,525 --> 00:13:08,958
maybe i'll see you later?

185
00:13:10,238 --> 00:13:11,585
Sure, yeah.

186
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,110
Bye.

187
00:13:57,448 --> 00:13:59,207
This is a hick town, mom.

188
00:13:59,752 --> 00:14:01,675
We've been in worse places.

189
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:03,202
A lot worse.

190
00:14:03,602 --> 00:14:05,275
Well, my clothes are all wrong.

191
00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:07,683
I need, like, some different shirts.

192
00:14:08,564 --> 00:14:10,102
You know, here everyone wears boots?

193
00:14:10,262 --> 00:14:11,604
Like, cowboy boots.

194
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,272
I hate cowboy boots.

195
00:14:15,176 --> 00:14:16,486
I'll see what I can do.

196
00:14:16,936 --> 00:14:19,820
Their computers are like,
from the frigging '50s or something.

197
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,396
Their computers?

198
00:14:21,565 --> 00:14:23,059
I thought we agreed...

199
00:14:23,179 --> 00:14:24,992
It wasn't my fault
they switched my class.

200
00:14:25,152 --> 00:14:26,952
I don't need you to be caught hacking.

201
00:14:27,112 --> 00:14:29,146
I'm not hacking, mom.
God, I know the rules.

202
00:14:29,266 --> 00:14:32,509
They're, like, written on the inside
of my eyeballs, all right?

203
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:48,473
Hey.

204
00:14:55,798 --> 00:14:57,691
You meet any pretty girls?

205
00:14:59,533 --> 00:15:02,613
No, I'm telling you, it's a hick town.

206
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:10,829
Come on.

207
00:15:29,778 --> 00:15:31,016
Agent Ellison.

208
00:15:31,611 --> 00:15:32,810
Welcome to New Mexico.

209
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:46,416
The sheriff's detachment'll hustle you
around on your business here,

210
00:15:46,536 --> 00:15:48,075
whatever that is, he wouldn't say.

211
00:15:48,894 --> 00:15:50,397
He doesn't know.

212
00:16:07,085 --> 00:16:08,557
I lied to you yesterday.

213
00:16:10,201 --> 00:16:12,143
My dad doesn't sell insurance.

214
00:16:12,881 --> 00:16:14,162
He's dead.

215
00:16:15,613 --> 00:16:17,938
He was a soldier.
He was killed on a mission.

216
00:16:19,453 --> 00:16:20,357
I'm sorry.

217
00:16:21,012 --> 00:16:23,490
It's all right. My mom was
pregnant with me when it happened.

218
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:25,235
I never even knew him.

219
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:27,392
So it's all right.

220
00:16:29,251 --> 00:16:30,384
My mom,

221
00:16:30,504 --> 00:16:32,161
she's kind of uptight.

222
00:16:33,239 --> 00:16:35,039
Actually, no, she's

223
00:16:35,271 --> 00:16:36,290
really uptight.

224
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,325
She likes me to come home
straight after school

225
00:16:38,445 --> 00:16:41,135
and hang out with her and
that kind of thing, you know?

226
00:16:41,762 --> 00:16:43,166
I'm all she's got.

227
00:16:48,512 --> 00:16:49,803
Thank you for explaining.

228
00:16:51,961 --> 00:16:53,459
It'll be our secret.

229
00:17:03,251 --> 00:17:05,433
Mr. Ferguson is ill today.

230
00:17:07,247 --> 00:17:08,697
My name is Cromartie.

231
00:17:08,857 --> 00:17:11,175
This that your only name? Like madonna?

232
00:17:11,979 --> 00:17:12,975
Madonna?

233
00:17:13,095 --> 00:17:14,745
Why? No.

234
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:24,546
Let's take attendance, then.

235
00:17:25,874 --> 00:17:26,757
Mary Booai.

236
00:17:26,917 --> 00:17:27,716
Here.

237
00:17:29,336 --> 00:17:30,219
Donald Chase.

238
00:17:30,379 --> 00:17:31,387
Here.

239
00:17:31,712 --> 00:17:33,525
- Franklin Lane.
- Here.

240
00:17:34,726 --> 00:17:35,974
Cynthia Nolan.

241
00:17:36,134 --> 00:17:36,949
Here.

242
00:17:38,095 --> 00:17:39,395
Wayne Parker.

243
00:17:39,555 --> 00:17:40,494
Here.

244
00:17:41,139 --> 00:17:42,608
Cameron Phillips.

245
00:17:45,143 --> 00:17:45,901
Cameron?

246
00:17:47,871 --> 00:17:48,799
Here.

247
00:17:51,212 --> 00:17:51,949
Reese?

248
00:17:52,603 --> 00:17:54,201
Do we have a John...

249
00:17:54,512 --> 00:17:55,682
Reese?

250
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:02,000
Excellent.

251
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,268
Class dismissed.

252
00:19:11,104 --> 00:19:14,273
<i>Witnesses are reporting gunfire
just minutes ago</i>

253
00:19:14,393 --> 00:19:17,451
<i>at Crestview High School in Red Valley.
Police are...</i>

254
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:03,205
Come with me if you want to live.

255
00:20:44,651 --> 00:20:45,581
Sarah Connor.

256
00:20:45,864 --> 00:20:48,375
Where is he?
What have you done with him?

257
00:20:53,909 --> 00:20:55,260
You don't know.

258
00:20:55,914 --> 00:20:57,101
You don't know...

259
00:20:57,728 --> 00:20:59,845
Killing yourself is the best strategy.

260
00:21:00,346 --> 00:21:03,140
If you're alive,
I can use you against him.

261
00:21:09,466 --> 00:21:11,023
- John?
- Mom, mom.

262
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:13,775
- I tried to call you.
- <i>Mom, I've been trying to call you.</i>

263
00:21:13,938 --> 00:21:15,694
Listen to me, okay? They're back.

264
00:21:15,854 --> 00:21:18,062
- It's back.
- John, slow down.

265
00:21:18,182 --> 00:21:20,157
- Where are you?
- <i>I'm going to the house.</i>

266
00:21:20,317 --> 00:21:21,825
- I'll be right there.
- Mom!

267
00:21:21,985 --> 00:21:24,735
I love you, John. Stay right there.

268
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:31,909
Let's go.

269
00:21:53,549 --> 00:21:54,566
John?

270
00:21:57,572 --> 00:21:58,677
John!

271
00:22:02,849 --> 00:22:04,785
- Are you okay?
- Mom?

272
00:22:04,945 --> 00:22:06,244
- John?
- Mom?

273
00:22:08,406 --> 00:22:09,247
John!

274
00:22:09,407 --> 00:22:10,110
No!

275
00:22:10,784 --> 00:22:11,699
John!

276
00:22:15,531 --> 00:22:17,005
Neat trick. You like?

277
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,943
Next time you do
what you're trained to do.

278
00:23:10,063 --> 00:23:11,643
You run. Go!

279
00:23:51,954 --> 00:23:55,062
- Did you stop him?
- 120 seconds and the system reboots.

280
00:23:56,204 --> 00:23:59,399
- I was sent here to protect John.
- Not now. Not yet.

281
00:24:43,003 --> 00:24:45,320
You might wanna put those
back in the holster.

282
00:24:50,776 --> 00:24:52,494
We should be good here two more hours.

283
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,367
Hit the border at lunchtime.

284
00:24:59,421 --> 00:25:00,853
What year are you from?

285
00:25:01,098 --> 00:25:02,134
2027.

286
00:25:05,762 --> 00:25:08,039
How long have you been looking for us?

287
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,678
73 days.

288
00:25:11,734 --> 00:25:12,681
And the war?

289
00:25:13,331 --> 00:25:14,966
The Skynet missile defense system

290
00:25:15,086 --> 00:25:17,644
goes online april 19th, 2011.

291
00:25:17,804 --> 00:25:19,059
Declares war on mankind

292
00:25:19,179 --> 00:25:22,031
and triggers a nuclear apocalypse
two days later.

293
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,509
Miles Dyson.

294
00:25:26,396 --> 00:25:28,332
Someone else builds Skynet.

295
00:25:31,277 --> 00:25:32,246
Who?

296
00:25:33,551 --> 00:25:35,795
- We don't know.
- You don't know who builds the computer

297
00:25:35,915 --> 00:25:38,523
- that blows up the world?
- I wasn't sent here for that.

298
00:25:38,643 --> 00:25:40,950
No, you were sent here to keep my son

299
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,502
from being assassinated.

300
00:25:44,873 --> 00:25:46,715
Your fiance went to the police.

301
00:25:48,164 --> 00:25:50,444
You should have changed your alias.

302
00:25:50,564 --> 00:25:51,386
Go to hell.

303
00:25:56,843 --> 00:25:58,268
They'd have found you anyway.

304
00:25:59,306 --> 00:26:00,651
They always do.

305
00:26:26,142 --> 00:26:28,079
There's Kevlar in that chair.

306
00:26:28,583 --> 00:26:30,724
APB's statewide, but it's been...

307
00:26:30,984 --> 00:26:31,843
19 hours.

308
00:26:35,225 --> 00:26:36,765
What the hell happened here?

309
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,748
22 witnesses, Deputy Ridge.

310
00:26:42,466 --> 00:26:44,981
22 of your good townfolk.

311
00:26:45,766 --> 00:26:47,817
That's a whole football team.

312
00:26:47,977 --> 00:26:49,611
Guess what 19 of 'em saw?

313
00:26:50,376 --> 00:26:52,113
A shooter with some kind of robot leg.

314
00:26:52,273 --> 00:26:53,602
A shooter...

315
00:26:53,722 --> 00:26:56,143
with some kind of robot leg.

316
00:27:27,934 --> 00:27:28,636
Hey.

317
00:27:31,012 --> 00:27:32,612
Why is this happening again?

318
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,148
I don't know.

319
00:27:41,307 --> 00:27:42,747
You stopped it.

320
00:27:44,866 --> 00:27:46,244
I guess I didn't.

321
00:27:53,389 --> 00:27:54,671
Well, you can.

322
00:27:58,163 --> 00:28:00,557
You changed the future.
You just didn't change it enough.

323
00:28:00,717 --> 00:28:02,118
So you can do it again.

324
00:28:02,429 --> 00:28:05,358
- I don't know, John.
- I can't keep running.

325
00:28:05,478 --> 00:28:06,271
I can't.

326
00:28:08,516 --> 00:28:10,191
I'm not who they think I am.

327
00:28:10,311 --> 00:28:11,359
Some messiah.

328
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:12,970
You don't know that.

329
00:28:16,107 --> 00:28:17,771
I know.

330
00:28:18,766 --> 00:28:20,535
I can't lead an army.

331
00:28:21,685 --> 00:28:23,371
Maybe that's you, but it'll never be me.

332
00:28:23,531 --> 00:28:25,162
So you've gotta stop it.

333
00:28:25,992 --> 00:28:26,915
Please.

334
00:28:32,697 --> 00:28:33,570
Mom.

335
00:28:38,056 --> 00:28:39,106
All right.

336
00:28:42,952 --> 00:28:44,184
All right what?

337
00:28:47,805 --> 00:28:48,884
I'll stop it.

338
00:28:51,215 --> 00:28:52,402
I'll stop it.

339
00:29:02,547 --> 00:29:04,431
We're not going across the border.

340
00:29:04,716 --> 00:29:06,284
Where are we going?

341
00:29:06,816 --> 00:29:08,138
To find Skynet.

342
00:29:22,008 --> 00:29:23,017
Chip?

343
00:29:34,445 --> 00:29:35,985
Back at school,

344
00:29:36,145 --> 00:29:38,071
you apologized for lying to me.

345
00:29:38,503 --> 00:29:40,657
So I should apologize for lying to you.

346
00:29:44,911 --> 00:29:46,413
It's all right. I get it.

347
00:29:48,074 --> 00:29:49,455
You needed to get close to me.

348
00:29:49,575 --> 00:29:51,021
It's just the way you're...

349
00:29:52,343 --> 00:29:53,169
programmed.

350
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:59,759
Like some hot girl is really gonna try
and make friends with the new weird kid.

351
00:30:01,151 --> 00:30:02,855
If I'd have thought about it,

352
00:30:03,155 --> 00:30:05,674
I would've known something
was messed up, you know?

353
00:30:09,905 --> 00:30:12,105
In the future, you have many friends.

354
00:30:18,905 --> 00:30:20,174
What model are you?

355
00:30:21,798 --> 00:30:23,448
Are you new? You seem...

356
00:30:25,513 --> 00:30:26,475
different.

357
00:30:33,021 --> 00:30:33,975
I am.

358
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,931
Let's go.

359
00:30:55,658 --> 00:30:57,373
Mom, pizza's here.

360
00:30:58,644 --> 00:31:00,280
Mom, the pizza!

361
00:31:04,616 --> 00:31:05,563
Mom.

362
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:07,744
You.

363
00:31:07,904 --> 00:31:09,536
We need to talk about Miles, Tarissa.

364
00:31:10,112 --> 00:31:12,334
Danny, go to your room. Right now.

365
00:31:13,867 --> 00:31:15,044
How dare you come here.

366
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:17,328
I know what they told you,
but it didn't happen that way.

367
00:31:17,531 --> 00:31:19,209
Get the hell out of here.

368
00:31:19,672 --> 00:31:21,633
- Now.
- It didn't happen that way.

369
00:31:25,797 --> 00:31:27,013
I can't let you do that.

370
00:31:27,514 --> 00:31:28,765
- Let go!
- Listen to me!

371
00:31:30,077 --> 00:31:31,351
I didn't kill Miles.

372
00:31:33,404 --> 00:31:34,836
All right, I didn't do it.

373
00:31:37,823 --> 00:31:38,941
I would never.

374
00:31:40,005 --> 00:31:41,287
Miles was a hero.

375
00:31:42,268 --> 00:31:43,738
Then why are you here?

376
00:31:45,063 --> 00:31:46,331
We're back.

377
00:31:54,104 --> 00:31:56,376
You told me there'd be no more machines.

378
00:32:03,459 --> 00:32:05,791
Look, it's happening again.
Everything we fought to stop.

379
00:32:07,422 --> 00:32:09,898
Miles' work at Cyberdyne
is the only link we have.

380
00:32:10,018 --> 00:32:11,712
Is there anyone, anywhere

381
00:32:11,832 --> 00:32:13,594
who's shown an interest in his work?

382
00:32:13,714 --> 00:32:16,580
Anyone he could've told.
Someone he forgot.

383
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,666
There's nobody. It's all gone.

384
00:32:19,239 --> 00:32:20,850
You destroyed it all.

385
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:23,236
You and Miles destroyed...

386
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,101
You destroyed everything.

387
00:32:32,996 --> 00:32:34,247
We have to go.

388
00:32:34,973 --> 00:32:35,777
Now.

389
00:32:51,309 --> 00:32:52,098
Help me.

390
00:32:53,384 --> 00:32:54,745
Help my son.

391
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:20,043
Mom! Mom!

392
00:33:43,151 --> 00:33:44,278
Oh, god.

393
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:06,320
Bandages, rubbing alcohol.

394
00:34:06,552 --> 00:34:08,270
- Mom, you need a doctor.
- Go!

395
00:34:08,543 --> 00:34:10,221
We'll find cover out back.

396
00:34:10,504 --> 00:34:12,428
First aid kit on the floor.

397
00:34:34,443 --> 00:34:36,625
Get it done before he gets back.

398
00:34:38,588 --> 00:34:40,361
I'll get some ice. It'll numb you,

399
00:34:40,481 --> 00:34:41,708
slow the blood loss.

400
00:34:41,868 --> 00:34:44,345
Needle and thread
to slow the blood loss.

401
00:34:44,465 --> 00:34:45,378
Do it now.

402
00:35:09,418 --> 00:35:11,000
We can't keep running.

403
00:35:14,778 --> 00:35:16,141
I'll lose my boy.

404
00:35:20,423 --> 00:35:21,678
He'll leave me.

405
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,616
He'll leave me.

406
00:35:50,151 --> 00:35:51,194
What time is it?

407
00:35:51,555 --> 00:35:52,695
7:52.

408
00:35:53,528 --> 00:35:54,987
How you feeling?

409
00:35:55,305 --> 00:35:56,032
Better.

410
00:35:56,764 --> 00:35:57,909
Good.

411
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:00,495
- We need to go.
- Where?

412
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,956
I'll show you.

413
00:36:10,526 --> 00:36:12,380
So do you have, like, an account here?

414
00:36:12,583 --> 00:36:14,126
Safety deposit box.

415
00:36:14,357 --> 00:36:15,614
When'd you open that?

416
00:36:15,868 --> 00:36:17,259
1963.

417
00:36:25,972 --> 00:36:27,706
Everybody on the floor!

418
00:36:27,826 --> 00:36:29,190
Please.

419
00:36:37,274 --> 00:36:38,991
Keys to the safety deposit boxes.

420
00:36:48,307 --> 00:36:50,026
Get inside. Keys.

421
00:36:55,304 --> 00:36:57,552
Lock us in, and then get away
from the door.

422
00:36:57,712 --> 00:36:59,136
I'll know if you don't.

423
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,245
You said you had a safety deposit box.

424
00:37:16,727 --> 00:37:17,640
I do.

425
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:42,282
Open these boxes.

426
00:37:42,882 --> 00:37:45,023
Put everything you find on the table.

427
00:37:46,441 --> 00:37:47,852
Carefully.

428
00:38:25,091 --> 00:38:27,168
Hey, James! You gotta see this.

429
00:38:31,845 --> 00:38:34,231
The alarm tripped seven minutes ago.

430
00:38:34,391 --> 00:38:37,519
Camera autodumps a digital copy
to the LAPD servers.

431
00:38:38,023 --> 00:38:39,403
Don't you know 'em?

432
00:38:41,257 --> 00:38:43,139
Less and less all the time.

433
00:38:45,498 --> 00:38:47,353
Is that from the future?

434
00:38:48,116 --> 00:38:50,122
You can't bring anything
through when you come.

435
00:38:50,393 --> 00:38:52,249
Not weapons, not clothing.

436
00:38:52,409 --> 00:38:53,250
Nothing.

437
00:38:56,308 --> 00:38:58,236
You send someone back to build it.

438
00:39:01,667 --> 00:39:03,034
What is it?

439
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,585
Hope.

440
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,411
Is that the police?

441
00:39:34,681 --> 00:39:36,210
No. Get away from the door.

442
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:37,294
Why?

443
00:39:39,582 --> 00:39:40,756
That's why.

444
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:56,990
That better be what I think it is.

445
00:39:57,481 --> 00:39:59,066
One of our best engineers.

446
00:39:59,226 --> 00:40:02,028
Took him eight months
to scavenge the parts.

447
00:40:02,188 --> 00:40:04,405
When the isotope solution
turns red, then fire.

448
00:40:04,565 --> 00:40:05,448
Isotope?

449
00:40:06,609 --> 00:40:07,825
Is this nuclear?

450
00:40:07,985 --> 00:40:09,368
No, not really.

451
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:19,490
I still don't get why you locked us in.
We didn't have to get trapped like rats.

452
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:20,838
We're not trapped.

453
00:40:30,088 --> 00:40:31,474
What is that?

454
00:40:31,634 --> 00:40:33,538
The engineer got a job
building the vault

455
00:40:33,658 --> 00:40:35,728
so we'd always have a way back home.

456
00:40:47,983 --> 00:40:49,033
What have you done?

457
00:40:49,371 --> 00:40:50,858
You wanna find Skynet?

458
00:40:51,035 --> 00:40:52,286
You wanna stop Skynet?

459
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:55,859
- This is the way.
- You don't know who builds it!

460
00:40:55,979 --> 00:40:58,417
No, but we know where and we know when.

461
00:40:58,577 --> 00:41:00,416
We can go kill it before it's born.

462
00:41:00,579 --> 00:41:01,796
You can stop running.

463
00:41:01,956 --> 00:41:03,226
Stay in one place.

464
00:41:03,346 --> 00:41:04,208
Fight.

465
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:33,452
Mom, we've gotta go now!

466
00:41:38,409 --> 00:41:39,208
Mom!

467
00:41:43,122 --> 00:41:43,904
Do it!

468
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:13,636
Where are we?

469
00:43:14,139 --> 00:43:15,244
Same where.

470
00:43:15,844 --> 00:43:17,234
Different when.

471
00:43:31,689 --> 00:43:33,113
<i>Check this out!</i>

472
00:43:35,526 --> 00:43:38,035
Good day, baby! I got something for ya!

473
00:43:53,633 --> 00:43:55,474
So this is where it all starts?

474
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,098
This is where Skynet begins?

475
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:02,170
Somewhere in there.

476
00:44:03,915 --> 00:44:05,819
And nobody knows we're here.

477
00:44:17,047 --> 00:44:18,301
You're safe.

478
00:44:21,315 --> 00:44:23,580
- No one is ever safe.
- No one is ever safe.

479
00:44:32,729 --> 00:44:33,820
Come on.

480
00:44:43,693 --> 00:44:46,229
<i>It is said that the death
of any one person</i>

481
00:44:46,625 --> 00:44:48,464
<i>is the death of an entire world.</i>

482
00:44:49,134 --> 00:44:50,756
<i>Certainly for parents,</i>

483
00:44:51,185 --> 00:44:53,988
<i>the death of a child
is no less than a holocaust.</i>

484
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:55,652
<i>In the case of my son,</i>

485
00:44:56,034 --> 00:44:58,324
<i>these words are literally true.</i>

486
00:44:58,652 --> 00:45:01,996
<i>And finally tonight, amateur video
of what we can only assume</i>

487
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:03,902
<i>is a college prank gone wrong</i>

488
00:45:04,161 --> 00:45:06,168
<i>as three streakers cause chaos</i>

489
00:45:06,288 --> 00:45:08,361
<i>trying to cross the 105 freeway.</i>

490
00:45:08,481 --> 00:45:10,836
Honey, did you hear me? We're late.

491
00:45:11,388 --> 00:45:12,302
Yeah,

492
00:45:12,684 --> 00:45:13,911
I heard you.

493
00:45:15,209 --> 00:45:17,457
<i>And even though
we've traveled through time,</i>

494
00:45:17,703 --> 00:45:19,461
<i>bent the rules of nature,</i>

495
00:45:20,825 --> 00:45:22,677
<i>they will keep coming for him.</i>

496
00:45:23,416 --> 00:45:25,173
<i>Keep trying to kill him.</i>

497
00:45:26,374 --> 00:45:28,010
<i>But until that day...</i>

498
00:45:34,474 --> 00:45:36,901
<i>It's gonna be one hell of a dogfight.</i>
