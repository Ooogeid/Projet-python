1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:03,560
In the future,

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,160
My son will lead mankind in a war against skynet,

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:11,320
A computer system programmed to destroy the world.

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,370
It has sent machines back through time.

5
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:19,880
Some to kill him. one to protect him.

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,030
Today, we fight to stop skynet from ever being created.

7
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,580
To change our future.

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,100
To change his fate.

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,630
The war to save mankind begins now.

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,720
Priviously on Terminator The sarah connor chronicles,

11
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,500
Your fiancee, Sarah Connor,

12
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,930
Killed a man because she believes that

13
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,150
In the future, he'll invent a computer system

14
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,070
That declares war on the world.

15
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,740
Andy goode rebuilt his chess computer.

16
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:52,840
The Turk.

17
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,110
Somebody killed him and took the machine.

18
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,160
No name, but he's got this on his arm.

19
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,210
That's a tattoo from a skynet work camp.

20
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,700
He's a resistance fighter.

21
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,830
I know who you are.

22
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,980
And I know who you are.

23
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,250
Sarah connor.

24
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,250
These things;

25
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,420
All of them are programmed

26
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,190
With specific missions.

27
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:17,370
We have to save him.

28
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:18,540
You don't even know who this guy is!

29
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,030
He's your uncle.

30
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:21,430
He doesn't know.

31
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,330
John!

32
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,920
He needs medical attention

33
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:26,810
Or he's going to die.

34
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,120
John?

35
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,260
Is it really you?

36
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,010
He's not breathing.

37
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:43,990
On the night we first met, John's father, Kyle Reese,

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,450
Told me words I remember to this day.

39
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,360
He meant them as a warning.

40
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,280
I think of them as words to live by.

41
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,200
He told me of an apocalypse yet to come.

42
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,350
Like a pandora's box, he unpacked every horror,

43
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,620
Every evil.

44
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,270
Every dark thing that haunts our future.

45
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,370
Helso left me an unborn son,

46
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,830
To whom he bequeathed what remained in the box

48
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,640
Hope.

49
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,570
Well, it nicked his left lung.

50
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,480
I got a fragment lodged in the soft tissue,

51
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:19,690
I can get it out, but will someone

52
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,320
Please tell me what the hell is going on around here?

53
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,330
She's a machine!

54
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,180
She's a liar!

55
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:24,980
Sedative, my bag!

56
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,400
She's a liar!

57
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,090
Everything she says is a lie!

58
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,300
Don't listen to her!

59
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,640
Don't listen-- don't!

60
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:32,340
Don't!

61
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,150
Get that bitch away from me!

62
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,700
No, no!

63
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,650
Get that bitch away from me!

64
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,940
You heard him.

65
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,110
Get away from me!

66
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,560
No!

67
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,250
Do you want him to die?

68
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,100
If I wanted him to die--

69
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,410
Cameron!

70
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:48,980
Mom, come on, what can I do?

71
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,290
I need a manual aspirator.

72
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,490
To drain the lung, okay?

73
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,320
It's in the back of my truck.

74
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:53,260
You know what it look like?

75
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:53,990
Yeah, I remember. go get it.

77
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,170
Oh, my god.

78
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,270
Gunshots, punctures, burns, some broken bones.

79
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,270
Second-rate medical treatment if anything at all.

80
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,660
Sarah, what--

81
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,530
I need more light.

82
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,470
Stay with me, okay?

83
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,750
You're an idiot, right?

84
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,510
It's an old wives' tale.

85
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,480
A trick.

86
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,130
It doesn't work. it's all in your mind.

87
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,480
It works.

88
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,780
I don't do it, and I haven't been sick for years.

89
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:58,110
That's because your guts are made of metal, like your head.

90
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,380
If you were a little smarter, you'd be a tin can.

91
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,740
I'm just saying you're wasting your time.

92
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,350
Again.

93
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,810
When I was in century--

94
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,720
Hey, Wisher,

95
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,170
Did you hear,

96
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,990
Brother Kyle was in century work camp.

97
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,560
No, really?

98
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:13,820
Go to hell.

99
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,090
Did he escape?

100
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,720
Was he a hero?

101
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,490
I heard he led John Connor through a slaughterhouse

102
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,580
Without taking a pin prick.

103
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:21,800
Oh, no, I heard it was two

104
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:22,780
Slaughterhouses.

105
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,440
And then he, uh, carried Connor.

106
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,220
It was one slaughterhouse.

107
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,740
Many Connors.

108
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,000
Right, right.

109
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,600
Centaur patrol.

110
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:52,680
What?

111
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,210
I hate that thing.

112
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:57,990
It's just a picture.

113
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,240
It's Connor's mother.

114
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,110
I don't get why

115
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,010
He'd give you that.

116
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,830
She's my lucky charm.

117
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,320
That's what makes me nervous.

118
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:06,850
Connor wants us top side.

119
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,350
Track back where the centaurs came from.

120
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,930
I think we lost the trail, boys.

121
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:32,400
Let's give it a few more blocks north-northeast.

122
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:35,550
If I was a cyborg tank, I think I'd come north-northeast.

123
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,410
I smell jet fuel.

124
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,530
Last time we found a tank factory, you smelled jet fuel.

125
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:44,160
I hear Connor's looking for bigger fish than factories.

126
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,450
I hear he's got squads out,

127
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,330
For some skynet secret weapon.

128
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,170
Don't they have enough weapons?

129
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,630
Why do they need a secret one?

130
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,240
What about it, Kyle?

131
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,530
Connor say anything to you?

132
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,310
No, not a word.

133
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,050
What the hell was that?

134
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,600
Kyle?

135
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,130
Hk!

136
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,270
Hk!

137
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,990
Kyle!

138
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,920
Kyle!

140
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,580
There we go.

141
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,000
Eight years.

142
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,220
That's how long I've been in l.a.

143
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,490
Eight years since my fiancee ran out on me.

144
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,390
Eight years since the fbi

145
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,910
Informed me that he was a homicidal

146
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,340
Paranoid schizophrenic

147
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,710
With an acute dislike for anything mechanical.

148
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,100
For what it's worth,

149
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:36,940
I didn't believe them.

150
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,860
Then you blew yourself up.

151
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,350
You look nervous.

152
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:48,950
Would you like a sedative?

153
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,840
There are sedatives

154
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:51,460
In Charley Dixon's bag.

155
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,890
I don't want a sedative.

156
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,200
Do you know who that is in there?

157
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:55,380
Who's dying on that table?

158
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,340
Yes, that man is first lieutenant Derek Thomas Reese

159
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,930
With the 132nd s.o.c.

160
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,760
Tech comm.

161
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:03,150
No, I mean, on a personal level.

162
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,410
Do you understand who he is?

163
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,750
Records indicate only blood relation is his brother.

164
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,110
Kyle reese.

165
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,920
And what information do you have about Kyle Reese?

166
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,610
Imprisoned at century sector work camp with John Connor,

167
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,480
2015.

168
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:17,910
Escaped with John Connor,

169
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,090
2021.

170
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,630
He was officially declared m.i.a. in 2027,

171
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,940
After being assigned to protect Sarah Connor

172
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,460
From a skynet attack.

173
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,960
Is that all?

174
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,550
Seems like a lot.

175
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,780
It is.

176
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,820
It was all over the news.

177
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,890
Three days later, I packed a bag, hop on the bike,

178
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,230
Drove to L.a., straight through.

179
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,100
I had to know.

180
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,920
I had to see it with my own eyes.

181
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:52,350
But then I got here, and there was nothing there.

182
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:55,050
Just a hole in the ground where the bank used to be.

183
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,160
I couldn't go home.

184
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:00,740
I could not.

185
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,100
I didn't want to leave you.

186
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,610
I didn't have a choice.

187
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,270
Gun to your head?

188
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:10,100
More like in my head, it's, um...

189
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,690
It's complicated.

190
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,610
Then uncomplicate it for me.

191
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,660
Kyle.

193
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,040
Hey, you mind?

194
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:42,230
Water?

195
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:44,790
What's going on? is he dead?

198
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:54,080
Buddy, you all right?

199
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,710
So...

200
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,350
Skynet,

201
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,290
Robots,

202
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,090
From the future?

203
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,050
And, you're a--

204
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,130
Yes. I'm a--

205
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,020
You need a-- a minute.

206
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,420
I was going to say a drink.

207
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,140
Oh, yeah, that, too.

208
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:27,080
Don't you have an endoskeleton you need to disappear,

209
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,250
Or something?

210
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,510
Yes, I've already prepared the thermite.

211
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,710
Thermite?

212
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,850
It's an incendiary chemical.

213
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,900
It burns at 2,500 degrees celsius.

214
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,990
Hot enough to liquefy this endoskeleton.

215
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,190
I know what thermite is, I'm just, uh,

216
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:44,800
Still working my way around "endoskeleton."

217
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,380
There's beers in the fridge.

218
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,600
I looked for a lime.

219
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:00,820
Sorry.

220
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,830
Are you mad at me for...

221
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,430
Getting you mixed up in all this?

222
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,900
Uh, no.

223
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:24,660
I just-- I guess--

224
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:29,660
I guess I wish I would have known back then.

225
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,930
I wish you could have trusted me.

226
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,550
I did.

227
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,610
Kyle.

228
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:59,420
How long you been here?

229
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,500
I don't know.

230
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,530
I think I just got here.

231
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:17,190
No, you were here when I got here.

232
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,150
Timms.

233
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,390
What's your name?

234
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,400
Reese.

235
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:23,960
There's a Reese who busted out of century work camp.

236
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:26,510
With John Connor, a while back.

237
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,970
Mad dogs could lead a pack, I heard.

238
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,860
No, that wasn't--

239
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,200
That wasn't me.

240
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,310
That's too bad.

241
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,100
What are they doing, Reese?

242
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,660
Is there a secret weapon?

243
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:07,150
It was Connor, right?

244
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,830
I don't know.

245
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,520
We go where we're told. we do what we're told.

246
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,630
Maybe Connor's wrong.

247
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,550
Maybe he's crazy.

248
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,420
You hear music?

249
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,470
I swear I hear music. real music.

250
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:25,730
There's a room in the basement.

251
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:28,680
What happens there?

252
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:33,300
What happens there?

253
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,490
Maybe our friend will tell us.

254
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,500
You should get the hell out of here.

255
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,490
Did you do something to him?

256
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,780
In the future?

257
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,780
I don't know.

258
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:04,810
You don't know?

259
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,110
When they reprogram us, they scrub our memories.

260
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,360
It increases the chance

261
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:09,950
Of success.

262
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,380
Success?

263
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,400
Of the reprogramming.

264
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,080
His lungs are hemorrhaging.

265
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,810
He's drowning in his own blood.

266
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,570
Charley!

268
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,370
I drained his lungs.

269
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,350
But your guy lost a lot of blood.

270
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,560
And he needs a transfusion.

271
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,660
Sarah's o-negative, the universal donor.

272
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,690
It doesn't matter; he needs at least three units

273
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,630
Of his own type,

274
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,660
Ab-negative.

275
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,470
Bad news is,

276
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,770
Only one half of one percent

277
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,530
Of the population

278
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,470
Are potential donors.

279
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,070
We don't find one,

280
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,540
You're gonna have a serious problem.

281
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,570
Then we take him

282
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,640
To a hospital.

283
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:56,760
Drop him off anonymously.

284
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,610
He's still wanted for Andy Goode's murder,

285
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,220
And for escaping federal custody.

286
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,940
We should let him die.

287
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,960
Test my blood.

288
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:07,620
Test me.

289
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,410
You heard the odds, Johnny, 200 to one.

290
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,720
Please, just test me.

291
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,100
Wisher.

292
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,110
Billy.

293
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,530
It's not like donating to the red cross;

294
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,760
He needs a lot of blood.

295
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,330
So, I don't get a cookie and a sticker

296
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,260
When it's over?

297
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,160
I'm serious.

298
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:28,120
Look, I don't see anyone else lining up.

299
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,730
You took a hell of a chance bringing Charley here.

300
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:35,450
Save me the speech, all right? I know.

301
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,960
You took a hell of a chance, and it worked out.

302
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,890
Is that what he looked like?

303
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,570
Did they look alike?

304
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:55,030
A little bit, yeah.

305
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:58,710
Same build, same complexion.

306
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,740
Not the eyes, though.

307
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,550
Even when your father was screaming about the machines,

308
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,350
He had such kind eyes.

309
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,970
We have to tell him.

310
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,490
We don't, and we can't.

311
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,240
He's family.

312
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,400
He's a stranger.

313
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,370
I sent him back here, so I must trust him.

314
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,030
Not enough to tell him about Kyle.

315
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,920
You didn't trust anyone enough to tell them about your father.

316
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,050
Anyone.

317
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,350
Can I confess to you?

318
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,810
I'm not a priest. far from it.

319
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,950
I'm a liar.

320
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:54,830
And the devil.

321
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,260
Oh, Billy.

322
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,890
The name's not Billy.

323
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,180
It's not Wisher.

324
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,400
What?

325
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,140
My name's Andy.

326
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:09,030
Andy goode.

327
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,950
All right, Andy.

328
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,010
I did this.

329
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,340
All of this, it's my fault.

330
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,550
What are you talking about?

331
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,990
I built skynet.

332
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,030
You need to rest.

333
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,490
You're very sick.

334
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,630
No, no.

335
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,550
I'm not sick.

336
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,990
I'm not sick. I did this.

337
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,150
All of this.

338
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,230
I was part of a team.

339
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,130
A group. ten of us.

340
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,050
Maybe 15, I don't know.

341
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,750
We used names.

342
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:56,710
We were liars.

343
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,890
I built computers.

344
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,660
I built a computer.

345
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,220
A mind.

346
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,760
It became angry.

347
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,670
And scared.

348
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,850
And I couldn't reassure it.

349
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,840
I'm sorry.

350
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,150
I'm sorry, please forgive me!

351
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,660
No, please.

352
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,450
That's quite a kid you got in there.

353
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,560
You have no idea.

354
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,350
Same rare blood type.

355
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:18,260
And his name, Reese. same as yours when we met.

356
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,830
It all adds up.

357
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,190
He's not John's father.

358
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,410
I'm not sure I'm ready to explain it.

359
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,630
It's complicated?

361
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,690
You could have told me.

362
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,460
Would you have believed me?

363
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,700
Charley? mom!

364
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,450
Where's Kyle? where's--

365
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,700
Where's Kyle?

366
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,270
Where's Kyle? where's--

367
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,380
Where is he? where'd you send him?

368
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:51,650
No, uh-uh, no.

369
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:54,790
Get off me!

370
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,860
Where is he?

371
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,450
Where'd you send him?

372
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,750
You owe me the truth!

373
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,870
Get this off!

374
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,670
Get it off of me! get it off of me!

375
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:07,010
Get--

376
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,950
He's my blood.

377
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:10,280
He's my blood!

378
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:11,510
He's my blood!

379
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,370
He's--

380
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,680
I think they're gone.

381
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,630
What is this, a game?

382
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:20,940
Yeah, it's always a game.

383
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,800
Reese, slow down!

384
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,130
Reese!

385
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:44,030
Reese!

386
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,240
Oh, my god.

387
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:51,060
No, god.

388
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,820
Oh, god.

389
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,300
So who's Kyle?

390
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:10,020
He from the future too?

391
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,800
He come back before?

392
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,910
And...

393
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,090
He's John's father.

394
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,320
Yes.

395
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,810
They're brothers. doesn't know.

396
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,930
So, when you used to say

397
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:25,840
That John's father was dead--

398
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:27,190
He is.

399
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,910
It was because of all of this.

400
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:35,970
Me.

401
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,330
We never had a chance.

402
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,560
Plasma burns, secondary explosions.

403
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,850
Skynet was here.

404
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:17,110
Maybe Connor and the others fell back

405
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,460
To the tunnel downtown.

406
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:48,040
Please, god, please.

407
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:11,310
Stand down!

408
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,810
Reese. Derek Reese.

409
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,080
Sumner.

410
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,850
We thought we lost you guys to the junkyard.

411
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:18,990
You did.

412
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,690
What happened?

413
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,730
Skynet found it, four nights ago.

414
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,020
We had a patrol

415
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,230
Out on the perimeter,

416
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,660
Four triple-"a"s snuck in around us.

417
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:29,810
Went straight for the hole.

418
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,450
Killed most.

419
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,630
Took some.

420
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,940
Rest easy.

421
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:36,210
Connor and your brother weren't here when it happened.

422
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:37,360
Where'd they go?

423
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:39,350
They found some skynet complex in Topanga canyon.

424
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,000
And decided to put all the firepower we had into it.

425
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:43,820
We lost a lot of men.

426
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,670
What was it?

427
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,950
I don't know.

428
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,480
Some kind of research facility.

429
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:49,850
Factory, something.

430
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,910
No one would tell us.

431
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,060
Connor took a small group,

432
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,440
Including your brother, deep into the place.

433
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:55,330
Left the rest of us outside to guard.

434
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:57,360
A couple days later, he came out.

435
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:58,850
Ordered us to blow the place to hell.

436
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,420
So what about Kyle?

437
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,690
What happened to my brother?

438
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,890
No one ever saw your brother again.

439
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:19,740
Take me to Connor now.

440
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,970
Hey, Sarah said I might be able to find

441
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,960
Some more gauze out back in--

443
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:44,540
Hey, is that really necessary?

444
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,250
It's dead.

445
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,230
Right?

446
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,150
Or powered off, whatever?

447
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,220
Every component must be destroyed beyond repair

448
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,640
Or recovery.

449
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:55,270
Even a single unaccounted for piece of the endoskeleton

450
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,870
Could alter the course of technological evolution.

451
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:01,160
And hasten the arrival of judgment day.

452
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:05,960
Uh, yeah.

453
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:11,140
You know, little girl?

454
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:14,150
You freak me the hell out.

455
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:17,910
On the outside, you're just as pretty as a picture.

456
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:23,820
But on the inside, you're a--

457
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:25,880
Hyper-alloy combat chassey.

458
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:30,800
Is that a complicated way of saying "robot?"

459
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:32,300
Cybernetic organism.

460
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:35,540
Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.

461
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:37,920
Okay. scary robot.

462
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:40,950
And here you are, carving up this guy

463
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,510
Into chum.

464
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:46,550
He's not a guy. he's a scary robot.

465
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:48,680
Okay, he's a scary robot?

466
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:52,760
You, you're a very scary robot.

467
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:59,330
You should go.

468
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,390
It's not safe for you here.

469
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,210
You're like a ghost come back.

470
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,450
And you're a Reese.

471
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:33,300
Tell me about the other reese.

472
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:35,220
Told you, it's classified.

473
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,630
I'm family.

474
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,660
We're all family.

475
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,370
Let me talk to Connor. he'll understand.

476
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,450
Kyle was his friend.

477
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,140
connor doesn't have any friends.

478
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:45,450
And he doesn't talk to anyone.

479
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,450
Fine, I'll find him myself.

480
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,970
Reese.

481
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,560
Metal!

482
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:01,050
No!

483
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,280
She's a machine! she's one of them!

484
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:05,300
No, damn it! she's one of ours.

485
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,640
One of ours?

486
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:21,010
It's reprogrammed.

487
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:23,360
And just given run of the place like pets?

488
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:24,930
This is Connor's show.

489
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,160
And that's what he wants.

490
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,590
Those machines kill.

491
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,220
They kill. it's all they do.

492
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:31,080
And now, they do it for us.

493
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:32,580
They helped us in Topanga.

494
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,590
We'd never have done what we did.

495
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,900
What did we do?

496
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:36,830
Derek.

497
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,010
What happened?

498
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,180
What happened up there?

499
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:40,550
What happened to my brother?

500
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,010
Hey!

501
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:34,560
Good, do it. kill me!

502
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:35,980
Son of a--

503
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,590
Sometimes they go bad.

504
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,380
No one knows why.

505
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,430
What did you say to Charley?

506
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,740
I freak him the hell out.

507
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,430
I'll bet you do.

508
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,990
I'll just bet.

509
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,570
I know what you're thinking.

510
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,270
I may not know how you think.

511
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,340
But I know what you're thinking about.

512
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:15,700
And what you're thinking about right now

513
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:18,070
Is exactly what you should not think about.

514
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,910
I didn't leave Charley because he was a threat to me or John.

515
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:29,590
We're a threat to him, do you understand?

516
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:31,520
You were right to leave him.

517
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:34,460
You don't go near him.

518
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:35,840
You don't touch him.

519
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:38,370
You swear to me you'll leave him alone,

520
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,520
Or, so help me, I will find a way

521
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:42,720
Of taking you apart, piece by piece.

522
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:45,390
I swear.

523
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,700
So do i.

524
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:51,640
That thing's done, right? it's vapor.

525
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:53,040
One missing component,

526
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,970
His left hand; I'll find it.

527
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,700
Everything needs to be destroyed.

528
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,550
Everything.

529
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,270
Everything.

530
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,780
Every last bolt.

531
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,940
Get it done.

532
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,360
I swear.

533
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,060
The best you could do for him now

534
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:29,730
Is keep feeding him pain killers,

535
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,110
And restrict his movement.

536
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,290
No lifting, no running,

537
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,450
No singing, and absolutely no gun fights.

539
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:42,110
If you need anything else...

540
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,340
I won't.

541
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:48,020
Now, you see, that's not what I was going to say at all.

542
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:50,050
I know, I can't let you say it.

543
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:53,210
What can I say?

544
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:56,740
Good-bye.

545
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:59,840
What-- what was that thing

546
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,480
That you always said?

547
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:06,410
There is no fate but what we make.

548
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,690
Remember?

549
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:11,610
The more I think about it, the more I realize

550
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:15,280
My fate was made before we met.

551
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,290
When John was born.

552
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:22,220
Can't angege it?

553
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,850
I'm not trying to change mine.

554
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,560
I'm trying to change his.

555
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:29,420
Yeah.

556
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:30,760
Okay.

557
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,150
Wait, there's um--

558
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,380
There's something else I got to tell you.

559
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:37,540
This is something you really need to know.

560
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,080
I didn't, um, I didn't tell him anything.

561
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:44,580
But, if you ask me, it's just a matter of time.

562
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,360
It always is.

563
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,330
There's a storm coming.

564
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:36,480
John wants to see you.

565
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,020
Derek.

566
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,530
Hey, Derek,

567
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,890
It's okay.

568
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,900
It's okay, it's all going to be okay.

569
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:28,310
Rest easy, okay? it's okay.

570
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:33,570
What is all this?

571
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:39,040
So this thing, it works?

572
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:40,540
He said it does.

573
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,420
I don't know how he knows, but he said so.

574
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,660
We go back.

575
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:46,550
20 years.

576
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,810
Set up a safe house, gather intel, and then what?

577
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:50,150
Hang in there, baby?

578
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,670
Until someone else shows up, and gives us more orders?

579
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:56,480
He didn't say anything about Kyle?

580
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:57,740
All that, and not a word about him?

581
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,050
We can save Kyle.

582
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,440
We can save everybody.

583
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:03,210
We can fix all the mistakes.

584
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,510
How're we gonna do that?

585
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,570
Reese, how are we going to do that?

586
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:54,380
Kyle reese, your brother,

587
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,300
He came across time to protect me.

588
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:03,130
He died fighting the machines.

589
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:07,310
He was a soldier.

590
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:10,420
And he was--

591
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:21,810
He was a hero.

592
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:26,360
He was a hero.

593
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:33,330
"listen," Kyle said.

594
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:35,800
"listen, and understand."

595
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:37,950
"the machine is out there."

596
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:40,810
"it can't be bargained with."

597
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,880
"it can't be reasoned with."

598
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:47,270
"it doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear."

599
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:51,830
"and it absolutely will not stop, ever."

600
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:55,710
"until you are dead."

47
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,990
after the nightmare fled

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,360
It's in the car

139
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,380
Kyle

267
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,780
i stop the bleeding
