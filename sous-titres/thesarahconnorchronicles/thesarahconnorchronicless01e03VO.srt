<i>In the future,</i>

2
00:00:08,353 --> 00:00:11,394
<i>my son will lead mankind
in a war against Skynet,</i>

3
00:00:12,685 --> 00:00:15,785
<i>a computer system programmed
to destroy the world.</i>

4
00:00:17,394 --> 00:00:20,035
<i>It has sent machines
back through time...</i>

5
00:00:20,642 --> 00:00:22,185
<i>some to kill him...</i>

6
00:00:22,305 --> 00:00:23,902
<i>one to protect him.</i>

7
00:00:24,148 --> 00:00:27,456
<i>Today we fight to stop Skynet
from ever being created.</i>

8
00:00:27,865 --> 00:00:29,465
<i>To change our future.</i>

9
00:00:30,475 --> 00:00:32,059
<i>To change his fate.</i>

10
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:36,025
<i>The war to save mankind begins now.</i>

13
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:45,632
<i>Previously on</i> Terminator:
The Sarah Connor Chronicles.

14
00:00:50,915 --> 00:00:52,472
- Where are we?
- Same where.

15
00:00:52,632 --> 00:00:53,814
Different when.

16
00:00:53,934 --> 00:00:56,995
- I want my new name, my all-new me.
- I'll track down Enrique.

17
00:00:57,115 --> 00:00:58,555
I need three sets of papers.

18
00:00:58,675 --> 00:01:00,980
My nephew has taken over the business.

19
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,423
- You're in the system.
- Uncle Enrique will be proud.

20
00:01:05,521 --> 00:01:07,821
He referred to you
as a rata... a snitch.

21
00:01:08,615 --> 00:01:10,699
- Why would you do this?
- Because you wouldn't.

22
00:01:11,255 --> 00:01:13,368
- Why not stay in the past?
- You died.

23
00:01:13,545 --> 00:01:15,355
Two years ago... Cancer.

24
00:01:15,822 --> 00:01:19,290
- I've seen that before.
- Skynet work camp. Resistance fighters.

25
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,710
- You sure there's money here?
- Anything they valued,

26
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,625
money, guns... it'll be hidden.

27
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:29,300
<i>You told me we'd be safe.</i>

28
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,885
<i>Skynet doesn't know you're here.</i>

29
00:01:31,456 --> 00:01:33,179
<i>There's no directive to hunt you.</i>

30
00:01:33,823 --> 00:01:36,349
What if they found it,
but they don't know what to do?

31
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:38,259
Who the hell are you, man?

32
00:01:41,586 --> 00:01:42,486
<i>They do.</i>

33
00:01:45,865 --> 00:01:49,279
<i>When I was in the mental hospital,
I became obsessed with science.</i>

34
00:01:49,726 --> 00:01:51,406
<i>Not all science, actually.</i>

35
00:01:51,825 --> 00:01:53,826
<i>And not really science at all.</i>

36
00:01:53,946 --> 00:01:55,076
<i>Scientists...</i>

37
00:01:55,503 --> 00:01:57,861
<i>and then only nuclear scientists.</i>

38
00:01:58,031 --> 00:01:59,664
<i>The ones who invented the bomb.</i>

39
00:02:01,534 --> 00:02:04,022
<i>Oppenheimer, Heisenberg,
Fermi, and Teller.</i>

40
00:02:04,245 --> 00:02:06,214
<i>Pioneers, geniuses all.</i>

41
00:02:07,556 --> 00:02:08,923
<i>I read every book I could.</i>

42
00:02:09,485 --> 00:02:10,998
<i>I wanted to understand</i>

43
00:02:11,118 --> 00:02:14,220
<i>why couldn't they stop,
these fathers of our destruction?</i>

44
00:02:15,775 --> 00:02:18,016
<i>And why wouldn't anybody stop them?</i>

45
00:02:20,812 --> 00:02:22,896
<i>And if I had the chance, would I?</i>

46
00:03:20,645 --> 00:03:21,545
Morning.

47
00:03:23,514 --> 00:03:24,744
You look like hell.

48
00:03:24,864 --> 00:03:25,764
Up late.

49
00:03:27,703 --> 00:03:29,224
Newsper clippings...

50
00:03:29,872 --> 00:03:31,673
surveillance photos, bank records.

51
00:03:32,227 --> 00:03:34,927
Pamphlets from every
high-tech company in the state.

52
00:03:35,047 --> 00:03:37,220
I even thought I saw the deeds
to city hall somewhere.

53
00:03:37,943 --> 00:03:41,529
Those resistance guys weren't
sent back here to be our support crew.

54
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:43,726
They're a Skynet hunting party.

55
00:03:45,396 --> 00:03:46,729
Really? Are you sure?

56
00:03:46,994 --> 00:03:50,316
Most of this is still a puzzle to me,
but there is one list I understand.

57
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:53,347
Employee list, Cyberdyne Systems.

58
00:03:54,827 --> 00:03:56,739
Seems they thought
it was a good place to start.

59
00:03:57,881 --> 00:03:58,881
And it is.

60
00:03:59,001 --> 00:04:00,869
She's not gonna be happy to see you.

61
00:04:02,223 --> 00:04:03,371
She never is.

62
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:07,186
- Want me to come along?
- No. You have your own job to do.

63
00:04:07,306 --> 00:04:08,306
A big one.

64
00:04:18,796 --> 00:04:20,820
You're getting pretty good at that.

65
00:04:21,841 --> 00:04:22,640
Thank you.

66
00:04:26,054 --> 00:04:28,396
Still, it's not exactly
brain surgery or anything.

67
00:04:28,834 --> 00:04:32,022
Be pretty funny if you were some sort of
advanced cybernetic intelligence,

68
00:04:32,142 --> 00:04:34,475
yet stumped by a stick of eyeliner.

69
00:04:35,325 --> 00:04:37,071
No, it's not brain surgery.

70
00:04:38,488 --> 00:04:40,408
It would have to be a lot sharper.

71
00:04:49,814 --> 00:04:50,914
Much better.

72
00:04:51,746 --> 00:04:53,465
When you wear clothes...

73
00:04:53,646 --> 00:04:54,746
much better.

74
00:04:56,876 --> 00:04:58,926
Six ways in. Six ways out.

75
00:04:59,271 --> 00:05:02,013
The front opens to the street here.
Security's minimal.

76
00:05:02,174 --> 00:05:04,933
Two armed guards in the morning.
Four in the afternoon.

77
00:05:05,093 --> 00:05:07,438
And if anything goes wrong,
there's a parking lot here.

78
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:09,375
Mom, it's high school, okay?

79
00:05:09,495 --> 00:05:10,772
Not supermax.

80
00:05:10,932 --> 00:05:12,326
We can handle it.

81
00:05:14,161 --> 00:05:15,318
We can handle it.

82
00:05:16,746 --> 00:05:18,146
Don't you kiss me.

83
00:05:22,216 --> 00:05:23,409
Or anyone else.

84
00:05:26,989 --> 00:05:28,380
Okay, now blend in.

85
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:29,928
Blend in.

86
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:33,753
Yeah, I mean don't seem like a freak.
You know what I mean, right?

87
00:05:33,913 --> 00:05:34,782
Freak.

88
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:37,631
Weirdo. Kook. Oddball. Crackpot.

89
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:39,963
Strange duck. Queer potato.

90
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:40,850
Nut.

91
00:05:41,546 --> 00:05:43,512
I've been reading the dictionary.

92
00:05:43,632 --> 00:05:45,575
- I don't sleep.
- That's what I'm talking about.

93
00:05:45,695 --> 00:05:47,308
You do that, you sound like a freak.

94
00:05:47,468 --> 00:05:49,477
Don't walk around
acting like my bodyguard.

95
00:05:49,637 --> 00:05:51,731
You're supposed to be my sister.

96
00:05:52,822 --> 00:05:54,452
You won't fool anyone.

97
00:05:56,065 --> 00:05:57,424
I fooled you.

98
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,079
What's that all about?

99
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:11,736
Appears to be a reimagining
of a trompe l'oeil fresco.

100
00:06:13,546 --> 00:06:14,836
I don't sleep.

101
00:06:18,052 --> 00:06:20,119
Cell phones, hats, rings, and bling,

102
00:06:20,239 --> 00:06:22,516
take it off and put it in the basket.

103
00:06:22,636 --> 00:06:25,136
Cell phones, hats, rings, and bling

104
00:06:25,256 --> 00:06:26,434
in the basket.

105
00:06:26,554 --> 00:06:28,057
In the basket, people. Come on.

106
00:06:28,444 --> 00:06:30,184
The line keeps moving. Let's go.

107
00:06:30,344 --> 00:06:32,562
Cell phones, hats, rings, and bling.

108
00:06:32,722 --> 00:06:33,740
In the basket.

109
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,380
Please, keep the line moving.

110
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,027
Cell phones, caps, rings, and bling.
In the basket, please.

111
00:06:39,187 --> 00:06:41,612
Let's go. Come on. Thank you.
Cell phones, caps, rings...

112
00:06:44,609 --> 00:06:46,159
Again with you, missy.

113
00:06:46,705 --> 00:06:49,871
Cell phones, hats, rings, and bling
in the basket.

114
00:06:50,031 --> 00:06:51,789
Hold that. Come through.

115
00:06:55,285 --> 00:06:57,670
Excuse me. This is my sister.

116
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:00,798
- Extra credit for you.
- She's got a metal plate in her head.

117
00:07:01,753 --> 00:07:03,051
Really. It's a big one.

118
00:07:09,383 --> 00:07:10,141
I fell.

119
00:07:10,862 --> 00:07:11,559
Hard.

120
00:07:12,563 --> 00:07:13,954
All right, let's go.

121
00:07:14,584 --> 00:07:16,022
Cell phones, caps.

122
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,243
I thought you were dead.

123
00:07:29,403 --> 00:07:30,553
Well, I'm not.

124
00:07:32,551 --> 00:07:33,605
Lucky you.

125
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,355
- You look...
- Different?

126
00:07:36,475 --> 00:07:37,475
The same.

127
00:07:37,765 --> 00:07:39,365
Well, I can't explain.

128
00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:41,975
I wouldn't want you to.

129
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:44,884
Is John...

130
00:07:45,304 --> 00:07:46,331
He's good.

131
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,742
What about that machine?

132
00:07:51,195 --> 00:07:52,558
She's still around.

133
00:07:53,385 --> 00:07:54,632
Not that one.

134
00:07:55,304 --> 00:07:57,096
- The other.
- No.

135
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,109
Do you mind?

136
00:08:01,945 --> 00:08:03,385
You brought it.

137
00:08:08,262 --> 00:08:09,624
Danny's not here?

138
00:08:11,496 --> 00:08:13,152
It's ten years, right?

139
00:08:15,002 --> 00:08:16,317
He's at school.

140
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,166
He hasn't come in a long time.

141
00:08:19,357 --> 00:08:20,920
I'm sorry to hear that.

142
00:08:24,385 --> 00:08:26,085
What do you want, Sarah?

143
00:08:27,194 --> 00:08:29,994
You never die,
and you always want something.

144
00:08:33,068 --> 00:08:34,868
I need you to look at these photographs,

145
00:08:34,988 --> 00:08:38,590
tell me if you recognize anybody.
I know it's been a long time, but...

146
00:08:51,363 --> 00:08:52,076
No.

147
00:08:53,988 --> 00:08:55,705
Nobody. Sorry.

148
00:08:56,045 --> 00:08:58,958
Cause one of them may be involved
with Skynet right now.

149
00:08:59,118 --> 00:09:00,968
They might not even know it.

150
00:09:10,594 --> 00:09:11,762
Sorry to bother you.

151
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:14,695
I'll leave you alone.

152
00:09:17,176 --> 00:09:18,662
The fourth photo.

153
00:09:19,756 --> 00:09:20,956
The young one.

154
00:09:21,785 --> 00:09:23,553
His name is Andrew Goode.

155
00:09:24,477 --> 00:09:25,320
Andy.

156
00:09:25,954 --> 00:09:28,487
He was an intern
at Cyberdyne one summer.

157
00:09:29,995 --> 00:09:31,484
Miles liked him.

158
00:09:35,215 --> 00:09:36,662
Is he going to die too?

159
00:09:38,525 --> 00:09:40,744
Is that what happens now, he dies?

160
00:09:41,869 --> 00:09:43,019
I don't know.

161
00:09:45,705 --> 00:09:46,881
I hope not.

162
00:09:48,776 --> 00:09:51,576
Well, if he does,
just make sure it matters.

163
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,305
Make sure it's not in vain.

164
00:09:57,006 --> 00:09:58,797
No one dies in vain.

165
00:10:16,362 --> 00:10:17,536
Agent Ellison.

166
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,705
They told me you were coming.

167
00:10:19,865 --> 00:10:22,333
But I told them the last time
you worked a crime scene,

168
00:10:22,493 --> 00:10:24,710
Hoover was cross-dressing at Quantico.

169
00:10:26,673 --> 00:10:27,814
Ballistics.

170
00:10:28,332 --> 00:10:30,443
I can already tell you mine are bigger.

171
00:10:31,878 --> 00:10:33,719
Same gun that killed your boys here

172
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:35,363
killed one of my CIs.

173
00:10:35,714 --> 00:10:36,990
Enrique Salzia.

174
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:38,849
What's the connection?

175
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,311
He made fake paper.
Your guys had fake paper.

176
00:10:42,479 --> 00:10:45,439
I hope you're not selling the terrorist
cell theory, 'cause I'm not buying it.

177
00:10:45,931 --> 00:10:48,566
- Why not?
- Well, look at the print report.

178
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,882
KLID, NCIC, CDP, Interpol.

179
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:55,689
There's nothing here.
These guys were drug dealers,

180
00:10:55,809 --> 00:10:57,097
small-time.

181
00:10:57,217 --> 00:10:59,720
Definitely not worth
you putting your tie on

182
00:10:59,905 --> 00:11:01,539
and breaking open your Thomas guide.

183
00:11:02,977 --> 00:11:04,092
Oh, yeah.

184
00:11:04,535 --> 00:11:07,378
You see this every day.
You didn't find that curious?

185
00:11:08,406 --> 00:11:11,132
Why would anyone wire a safe
directly into the power?

186
00:11:11,465 --> 00:11:13,968
Why's the sky blue, Ellison?
Don't overthink it.

187
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,428
The guys were druggies.

188
00:11:15,588 --> 00:11:18,162
They're not rocket scientists,
not terrorists.

189
00:11:18,282 --> 00:11:20,331
Your guy sold my guys paper.

190
00:11:20,451 --> 00:11:23,009
My guys whacked your guy
to cover their tracks.

191
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:25,771
Go back to your office.
Your desk misses you.

192
00:11:26,613 --> 00:11:27,522
Right.

193
00:11:27,864 --> 00:11:28,916
Good one.

194
00:11:33,689 --> 00:11:36,761
Somebody came back here
for whatever was in that safe.

195
00:11:37,526 --> 00:11:38,852
They're out there.

196
00:11:39,486 --> 00:11:40,786
And I'm gonna find them.

197
00:11:54,567 --> 00:11:55,425
Hey, buddy.

198
00:11:55,669 --> 00:11:56,635
Hey!

199
00:11:57,406 --> 00:11:58,846
Can't go in there!

200
00:12:48,447 --> 00:12:49,207
Hey!

201
00:13:11,887 --> 00:13:12,711
Enjoy.

202
00:13:14,246 --> 00:13:15,736
Have a good day.

203
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:22,555
Can I help you?

204
00:13:22,876 --> 00:13:23,639
No.

205
00:13:25,949 --> 00:13:26,949
Andy.

206
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,727
Just looking.

207
00:13:29,821 --> 00:13:32,273
You just kept looking over
like you needed something.

208
00:13:36,175 --> 00:13:37,597
That's the phone.

209
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,197
Seriously, if I was gonna
be alone on a desert island

210
00:13:40,357 --> 00:13:43,345
with only a phone for a companion,
that would absolutely be the phone.

211
00:13:43,563 --> 00:13:45,119
Is that something you would do?

212
00:13:46,523 --> 00:13:47,288
May I?

213
00:13:48,826 --> 00:13:51,542
Got a four-meg camera.
Texting... true texting too.

214
00:13:51,702 --> 00:13:53,878
Not that SMS cartoon bubble junk.

215
00:13:54,038 --> 00:13:55,963
3G data access.
10 Gigs free music.

216
00:13:56,123 --> 00:13:59,049
6 hours of talk time and
36 standby on your battery.

217
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:03,746
What happens if I press
these numbers here?

218
00:14:04,266 --> 00:14:05,264
'Scuse me?

219
00:14:05,424 --> 00:14:07,141
These numbers, one through nine.

220
00:14:08,886 --> 00:14:10,685
If I press seven of them, will someone

221
00:14:10,805 --> 00:14:13,272
talk to me through the ear part up here?

222
00:14:15,385 --> 00:14:16,233
Yeah.

223
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:19,109
Okay. I'll take three.

224
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:36,015
Hello?

225
00:14:36,135 --> 00:14:36,854
<i>Hi.</i>

226
00:14:39,449 --> 00:14:40,818
Are you calling me?

227
00:14:41,074 --> 00:14:42,384
<i>I was just following up</i>

228
00:14:42,544 --> 00:14:43,969
to make sure phones are okay.

229
00:14:44,336 --> 00:14:46,085
I just left the store.

230
00:14:46,699 --> 00:14:47,699
I know.

231
00:14:49,857 --> 00:14:52,019
Okay. Do you wanna have
dinner with me tonight?

232
00:14:52,179 --> 00:14:53,001
No.

233
00:14:53,847 --> 00:14:56,314
Well, you answered too quickly.
Hear me out.

234
00:14:56,475 --> 00:14:58,317
Just give me one minute.

235
00:14:59,695 --> 00:15:01,586
- 30 seconds?
- Talk fast.

236
00:15:02,231 --> 00:15:04,388
Okay, well, first let me
clear up the whole

237
00:15:04,508 --> 00:15:07,910
desert island and a cell phone thing.
Seems kind of strange if you picture it.

238
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,161
I wasn't.

239
00:15:09,321 --> 00:15:11,750
Right, of course. Why would you?
It's an asinine sales pitch.

240
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,607
There's nowhere to plug in the phone.

241
00:15:13,727 --> 00:15:16,085
It would be worth less than
a rock when the battery died.

242
00:15:16,635 --> 00:15:19,797
- Couldn't use it to open a coconut.
- This is you selling yourself?

243
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:23,425
Selling myself? Oh, I don't know.
There's something immoral

244
00:15:23,585 --> 00:15:25,651
about the whole selling process.

245
00:15:25,952 --> 00:15:27,429
And yet, that's your job.

246
00:15:27,589 --> 00:15:29,765
Part-time.
And I'm not very good at it.

247
00:15:30,182 --> 00:15:32,601
So I'm actually less immoral
than the average...

248
00:15:33,789 --> 00:15:34,693
anyway.

249
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,148
Where was I?

250
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:39,942
You're right.

251
00:15:40,378 --> 00:15:41,318
About what?

252
00:15:42,134 --> 00:15:43,720
I answered too quick.

253
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,460
Mr. Baum.

254
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,999
- Yes.
- Take your seat, please.

255
00:16:00,824 --> 00:16:02,460
- Hi.
- Hi.

256
00:16:02,775 --> 00:16:04,550
Okay, paper and pencil out.

257
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,199
Time for a pop quiz.

258
00:16:13,268 --> 00:16:14,507
Here.

259
00:16:16,295 --> 00:16:17,213
Come in.

260
00:16:20,487 --> 00:16:22,008
I said come on in.

261
00:16:25,528 --> 00:16:26,905
I'm transferring in.

262
00:16:33,185 --> 00:16:35,131
Okay. Any open seat.

263
00:16:41,706 --> 00:16:44,706
What part about don't act like a freak
didn't you understand?

264
00:16:45,106 --> 00:16:46,175
Sit down.

265
00:17:18,944 --> 00:17:20,147
- So...
- So?

266
00:17:20,578 --> 00:17:23,170
Like I said on the phone,
your sweet uncle Enrique

267
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:26,715
lived a colorful life.
One we have not yet painted in full.

268
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,218
You grow apart.

269
00:17:28,725 --> 00:17:31,528
Every day's a new adventure.
Who can keep up?

270
00:17:36,652 --> 00:17:38,929
I got an uncle who's like a father.

271
00:17:39,093 --> 00:17:41,383
I also got one who's like a stranger.

272
00:17:41,503 --> 00:17:43,635
- How 'bout you two?
- More like an a aunt.

273
00:17:43,755 --> 00:17:45,025
Chatty, chatty.

274
00:17:46,412 --> 00:17:47,277
All right.

275
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:50,001
So you're not too close.

276
00:17:50,973 --> 00:17:53,480
But he did call you three times
the day he was murdered.

277
00:17:54,068 --> 00:17:55,327
What'd you chat about?

278
00:17:55,671 --> 00:17:57,538
Well, those lakers.

279
00:17:57,698 --> 00:17:59,748
Really? What about 'em?

280
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,712
Kobe. He's the bomb.

281
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,711
I always thought he was a ball hog.

282
00:18:04,605 --> 00:18:07,965
He's all alone, man.
He's got no one elsewho can shoot.

283
00:18:08,244 --> 00:18:09,751
Is that you, Carlos?

284
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:12,858
Now that your uncle's dead?

285
00:18:13,765 --> 00:18:15,013
You all alone?

286
00:18:15,956 --> 00:18:16,805
Yeah...

287
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,901
all these boys can shoot.

288
00:18:31,846 --> 00:18:33,282
I didn't kill my uncle.

289
00:18:33,442 --> 00:18:34,298
No.

290
00:18:35,902 --> 00:18:38,245
And you're too smart to know
nothing about who did.

291
00:18:43,785 --> 00:18:45,204
I'll be in touch.

292
00:18:57,664 --> 00:19:00,868
No, I know. The guy's 18 months
ahead of the germans.

293
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:04,322
Yeah, well, I would
if I had that kinda grant money.

294
00:19:04,651 --> 00:19:07,054
No, I'm not saying
the guy's a complete idiot.

295
00:19:07,324 --> 00:19:09,698
But it's not exactly
avant-garde science, is it?

296
00:19:09,946 --> 00:19:12,345
Why don't they give the money
to the people on the cutting edge?

297
00:19:12,465 --> 00:19:14,440
But they never do. They never...

298
00:19:30,055 --> 00:19:30,986
Hey.

299
00:19:32,501 --> 00:19:33,509
How was school?

300
00:19:34,243 --> 00:19:35,803
I have a metal plate in my head.

301
00:19:36,904 --> 00:19:38,639
She's gonna need a note.

302
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,307
I meant you, not her.

303
00:19:40,467 --> 00:19:42,673
- Yeah, fine.
- You're not gonna give me anything?

304
00:19:42,793 --> 00:19:44,974
We went, we learned.
I didn't get killed.

305
00:19:45,094 --> 00:19:47,757
She didn't kill anybody.
It was a pretty good first day, I think.

306
00:19:47,877 --> 00:19:49,666
- What about you, did you go?
- I did.

307
00:19:49,786 --> 00:19:51,642
And was she surprised
to see you weren't dead?

308
00:19:51,762 --> 00:19:53,570
More like disappointed.

309
00:19:54,186 --> 00:19:56,030
She ID'd one of the safe house photos.

310
00:19:56,325 --> 00:19:59,284
- Intern at Cyberdyne.
- Really? So what does he do now,

311
00:19:59,444 --> 00:20:01,370
build rocket guidance
systems or something?

312
00:20:02,122 --> 00:20:03,576
Cell phone salesman.

313
00:20:04,623 --> 00:20:05,414
Shut up.

314
00:20:05,534 --> 00:20:07,918
Cell phone salesman.
And not a very good one.

315
00:20:08,226 --> 00:20:09,993
These need to be cleaned.

316
00:20:13,157 --> 00:20:14,911
Okay, so about the cell phone guy.

317
00:20:15,031 --> 00:20:17,344
I-I'm having dinner with him tonight.

318
00:20:18,267 --> 00:20:20,764
Dinner?
What do you mean, like a date?

319
00:20:21,765 --> 00:20:24,393
- Not a date.
- Are you going to kill him?

320
00:20:26,042 --> 00:20:27,059
Kill him?

321
00:20:27,639 --> 00:20:29,648
I don't know the first thing about him.

322
00:20:29,768 --> 00:20:31,773
He interned at Cyberdyne
when he was in college.

323
00:20:31,893 --> 00:20:33,735
His photo is in a pile of photos.

324
00:20:37,751 --> 00:20:39,616
Nobody dies till I say so.

325
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:43,120
Tell her.

326
00:20:44,449 --> 00:20:47,207
People die all the time.
They won't wait for her.

327
00:20:52,409 --> 00:20:53,932
I fooled you again.

328
00:21:01,341 --> 00:21:02,538
Who are you?

329
00:21:04,135 --> 00:21:05,699
How did you find me?

330
00:21:05,985 --> 00:21:07,971
What--what do you want?

331
00:21:09,639 --> 00:21:11,982
Are you a veteran?
Is that what this is about?

332
00:21:13,382 --> 00:21:14,443
Do you speak?

333
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,943
Read that.

334
00:21:25,998 --> 00:21:27,331
How did you...

335
00:21:35,703 --> 00:21:37,549
No, no, no. That's not possible.

336
00:21:37,709 --> 00:21:40,302
That's an epidermal growth rate.
That's just not sustainable.

337
00:21:40,462 --> 00:21:41,803
Kecyte and...

338
00:21:41,963 --> 00:21:44,327
at that rate, you couldn't
possibly maintain

339
00:21:44,447 --> 00:21:46,683
cell regulation or differentiation.

340
00:21:46,843 --> 00:21:48,310
It's impossible.

341
00:21:48,953 --> 00:21:49,879
Possible.

342
00:21:55,237 --> 00:21:56,648
Woo was wrong.

343
00:22:00,064 --> 00:22:01,518
Thomason was wrong.

344
00:22:01,812 --> 00:22:04,414
Parker and Lang were
almost right and still...

345
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:06,853
completely wrong. I was...

346
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,442
I wasn't even close.

347
00:22:09,963 --> 00:22:11,361
Can you do it?

348
00:22:15,073 --> 00:22:15,890
Well,

349
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,813
I'd have to go to my lab.
There's a whole mix of...

350
00:22:20,032 --> 00:22:22,388
growth rates, TGF Beta,

351
00:22:22,643 --> 00:22:24,077
PDGF, EGF.

352
00:22:24,197 --> 00:22:25,375
I'd need...

353
00:22:26,087 --> 00:22:28,283
You know, this is a lot of equipment.

354
00:22:28,937 --> 00:22:31,047
Oh, and blood. We'd need...

355
00:22:31,339 --> 00:22:33,077
at least 20 units.

356
00:22:33,197 --> 00:22:35,232
Preferably with tissues comprised of...

357
00:22:35,392 --> 00:22:36,965
I brought my own.

358
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:41,951
Can you do it?

359
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:45,943
Yes.

360
00:22:50,615 --> 00:22:51,788
Yes, I can.

361
00:22:55,281 --> 00:22:56,733
<i>In 1943,</i>

362
00:22:57,075 --> 00:22:59,021
<i>the german physicist Werner Heisenberg</i>

363
00:22:59,141 --> 00:23:02,148
<i>delivered a physics lecture
to a packed hall in Zurich.</i>

364
00:23:02,445 --> 00:23:04,528
<i>One of the audience members
was Moe Berg,</i>

365
00:23:04,648 --> 00:23:06,377
<i>an ex-professional baseball player</i>

366
00:23:06,497 --> 00:23:08,582
<i>working as a spy for the O.S.S.</i>

367
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,222
<i>Berg's task was to listen to</i>

368
00:23:10,385 --> 00:23:12,681
<i>the lecture and determine
whether Heisenberg and the germans</i>

369
00:23:12,801 --> 00:23:15,088
<i>were close to perfecting
the atomic bomb.</i>

370
00:23:15,724 --> 00:23:17,943
<i>If berg discovered
that this was the case,</i>

371
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,200
<i>he was to wait for
heisenberg outside the hall</i>

372
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,987
<i>and shoot the scientist in the head.</i>

373
00:23:27,211 --> 00:23:29,542
<i>He had never killed anyone before.</i>

374
00:23:36,722 --> 00:23:38,365
So what's your deal, Andy?

375
00:23:38,635 --> 00:23:41,514
I can't imagine you majored
in cell phone sales at college.

376
00:23:41,634 --> 00:23:42,507
No.

377
00:23:42,816 --> 00:23:45,322
No. More like funions
and 12-packs of jolt

378
00:23:45,442 --> 00:23:48,692
from the vintage soda store while
my roommates and I hacked Zelda 3.

379
00:23:48,812 --> 00:23:51,475
So the princess would say
funny lines ripped from reruns.

380
00:23:51,979 --> 00:23:54,281
What's that language you speak, boy?

381
00:23:54,993 --> 00:23:56,472
Computer science.

382
00:23:56,678 --> 00:23:59,274
Caltech. Advanced... dork.

383
00:24:00,441 --> 00:24:03,417
And what would you do
with a computer degree from...

384
00:24:03,537 --> 00:24:05,906
- Caltech?
- I don't know. I never got one.

385
00:24:06,816 --> 00:24:07,616
Really?

386
00:24:08,035 --> 00:24:09,422
My father died senior year.

387
00:24:09,542 --> 00:24:12,662
Mom went a little off the rails.
I dropped out to help.

388
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,598
I'm sorry.

389
00:24:14,991 --> 00:24:16,750
That was a long time ago, but...

390
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,117
thanks anyway.

391
00:24:18,774 --> 00:24:21,254
She's good. She married
the security guard at her bank.

392
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:27,855
You have family?

393
00:24:28,828 --> 00:24:29,814
Distant.

394
00:24:32,198 --> 00:24:35,965
Don't take this the wrong way, but as a
cell phone salesman, I think I can ask.

395
00:24:36,085 --> 00:24:38,355
Did you ever wanna be anything
other than a waitress?

396
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,373
Yes, I did.

397
00:24:41,017 --> 00:24:41,983
What was it?

398
00:24:43,771 --> 00:24:45,061
I can't remember.

399
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:52,661
What's this, Andy?

400
00:24:55,865 --> 00:24:57,263
Oh, isn't it great?

401
00:24:57,843 --> 00:25:01,378
That is the official promotional poster
for the Kramnik - Deep Fritz match.

402
00:25:02,198 --> 00:25:03,171
Awesome match.

403
00:25:03,331 --> 00:25:06,091
Just awesome. Most people cite
the '97 Kasparov/Deep Blue

404
00:25:06,532 --> 00:25:09,970
as the watershed man versus
machine chess match. But...

405
00:25:10,752 --> 00:25:14,015
Fritz would have wiped the floor with
Blue like Kramnik did with Kasparov.

406
00:25:14,616 --> 00:25:17,249
Besides, the other
poster's impossible to find.

407
00:25:18,779 --> 00:25:20,697
What is it you do, Andy?

408
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:24,651
Do you wanna see?

409
00:25:25,712 --> 00:25:27,109
Yes, I wanna see.

410
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:30,097
All right.

411
00:25:35,081 --> 00:25:36,026
Be hold...

412
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:39,916
the Turk.

413
00:25:43,382 --> 00:25:44,212
The Turk.

414
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:46,965
Well, not the original Turk.

415
00:25:47,341 --> 00:25:49,507
The original turk was an automaton

416
00:25:49,627 --> 00:25:51,628
constructed and unveed in 1770

417
00:25:51,748 --> 00:25:53,930
by the baron Wolfgang von Kempelen.

418
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,766
It played chess.

419
00:25:56,926 --> 00:25:59,853
Is that what your Turk does?
It plays chess?

420
00:26:00,013 --> 00:26:01,563
I know that sounds boring as hell.

421
00:26:02,323 --> 00:26:03,857
Most people think so. But...

422
00:26:04,058 --> 00:26:05,788
maybe I should put it this way.

423
00:26:06,394 --> 00:26:08,120
My turk plays chess

424
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,843
at a level that could defeat

425
00:26:09,963 --> 00:26:13,074
every human player that has ever lived
and probably ever will live.

426
00:26:13,761 --> 00:26:14,951
That's not bragging.

427
00:26:15,111 --> 00:26:17,944
A number of AIs can do that now.
But the AI chess platform

428
00:26:18,114 --> 00:26:21,583
is very valuable for artificial
intelligence developers these days.

429
00:26:23,063 --> 00:26:24,090
What?

430
00:26:24,788 --> 00:26:26,922
I thought I saw someone outside.

431
00:26:43,927 --> 00:26:45,106
It's a prowler.

432
00:26:46,255 --> 00:26:47,150
Back porch.

433
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,861
It's the police. There's been some
break-ins in the neighborhood.

434
00:26:50,529 --> 00:26:52,113
- My...
- I have to go, Andy.

435
00:26:52,273 --> 00:26:53,460
No, Sarah, wait.

436
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,666
It's 165 Mesrow. Sarah!

437
00:26:56,955 --> 00:26:58,452
Again, what did it look like?

438
00:26:59,872 --> 00:27:02,516
What did it look like?
Who cares what it looked like?

439
00:27:02,636 --> 00:27:04,598
It was just a rack
of computer equipment.

440
00:27:04,718 --> 00:27:07,128
Okay, but was there
obvious network access?

441
00:27:07,288 --> 00:27:09,089
Do you know what kind of bandwidth?

442
00:27:09,209 --> 00:27:10,599
Are you joking?

443
00:27:10,719 --> 00:27:12,800
What about power supply?
Was there a cooling element,

444
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:15,220
- like a fan or something?
- John.

445
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,534
Mom, I'm just trying to get
a sense of the horsepower.

446
00:27:17,654 --> 00:27:19,708
I wanna know if this thing was a...

447
00:27:19,828 --> 00:27:21,601
dinky little homemade soap box

448
00:27:21,761 --> 00:27:23,979
or if it was a full-fledged AI platform

449
00:27:24,514 --> 00:27:28,106
capable of learning and growing
and taking on other applications.

450
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:29,901
It plays chess.

451
00:27:31,589 --> 00:27:32,988
So did Einstein.

452
00:27:38,266 --> 00:27:40,638
Have you ever heard of the singularity?

453
00:27:43,301 --> 00:27:45,083
It's a point in time where machines

454
00:27:45,243 --> 00:27:46,521
become so smart

455
00:27:46,721 --> 00:27:49,642
that they're capable of making even
making smarter versions of themselves

456
00:27:49,762 --> 00:27:51,068
without our help.

457
00:27:54,383 --> 00:27:57,470
That's pretty much the time
we can kiss our asses good-bye.

458
00:27:58,657 --> 00:28:00,095
Unless we stop it.

459
00:28:02,725 --> 00:28:04,144
Like you said you would.

460
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:18,825
So I caught a break on a set of
fingerprints from our drug dealers.

461
00:28:19,503 --> 00:28:21,982
I wanted to see your face
when I laid that on you.

462
00:28:23,298 --> 00:28:26,853
See, the only fingerprint database
I hadn't checked was kid prints.

463
00:28:28,026 --> 00:28:29,127
That's no joke.

464
00:28:29,288 --> 00:28:31,003
That's one of your dead terrorists.

465
00:28:31,164 --> 00:28:35,091
A black-haired, brown-eyed
35-pound four-year-old boy living

466
00:28:35,251 --> 00:28:36,653
in Canton, Ohio.

467
00:28:42,174 --> 00:28:44,309
And that's the look I wanted to see.

468
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:51,054
Hold up.

469
00:28:55,283 --> 00:28:57,572
Did your crime scene guys find any

470
00:28:57,732 --> 00:28:59,032
peculiar blood?

471
00:28:59,366 --> 00:29:02,202
I think they got all the peculiar
they could stomach with these prints.

472
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:06,790
Lab says some blood evidence found at
my ci crime scene is almost human...

473
00:29:07,407 --> 00:29:09,584
except there's no
red blood cells present.

474
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:13,046
I wanna see the blood
evidence from your guys.

475
00:29:15,202 --> 00:29:16,382
I'll get back to you.

476
00:29:17,229 --> 00:29:19,434
You're gonna...
double-check those prints, right?

477
00:29:19,554 --> 00:29:21,137
On the kid, in Canton?

478
00:29:25,761 --> 00:29:26,968
Have a party.

479
00:29:34,618 --> 00:29:37,501
The one thing I hadn't thought of,
the one thing nobody thought possible

480
00:29:37,621 --> 00:29:40,117
was the use of
a synthetic oxygen carrier.

481
00:29:44,445 --> 00:29:47,623
By creating a synthetic spear
that carries oxygen,

482
00:29:47,743 --> 00:29:49,523
bringing nutrients to the skin,

483
00:29:49,643 --> 00:29:52,495
it obviates the need for
the marrow interaction.

484
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,507
The real world applications are...

485
00:29:59,502 --> 00:30:00,510
mind-blowing.

486
00:31:05,662 --> 00:31:06,552
Sarah?

487
00:31:08,169 --> 00:31:11,017
Didn't you get my message? I returned
your call about the test results.

488
00:31:11,137 --> 00:31:12,620
Yeah, I got your message.

489
00:31:13,291 --> 00:31:15,141
You're healthy as a horse.

490
00:31:15,579 --> 00:31:16,954
A healthy horse.

491
00:31:17,074 --> 00:31:19,130
I got that from your message.

492
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:21,391
I wanted to talk to you
about prevention.

493
00:31:21,511 --> 00:31:22,595
For cancer?

494
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:24,969
What you're doing seems to be working.

495
00:31:25,129 --> 00:31:26,471
Specifically.

496
00:31:27,975 --> 00:31:29,153
Don't smoke.

497
00:31:29,273 --> 00:31:31,811
Get lots of exercise.
Eat leafy greens.

498
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:33,144
Don't snort asbestos.

499
00:31:35,345 --> 00:31:38,177
I don't mean to make light,
but you've got no risk factors.

500
00:31:38,297 --> 00:31:40,338
No genetic disposition.
Is there anything else

501
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:42,845
about your history that I should know?

502
00:31:43,941 --> 00:31:44,653
No.

503
00:31:46,851 --> 00:31:48,159
You've got children, right?

504
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:51,764
Yeah, I got two myself.

505
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:53,081
You worry.

506
00:31:53,257 --> 00:31:56,552
You wanna make sure you're
always healthy and strong for them.

507
00:31:58,099 --> 00:32:00,729
Don't drive yourself crazy
chasing the future.

508
00:32:01,077 --> 00:32:02,605
We can't predict...

509
00:32:03,467 --> 00:32:05,006
you know?
We can only...

510
00:32:05,394 --> 00:32:07,019
try and prevent.

511
00:32:20,841 --> 00:32:21,787
Andy,

512
00:32:22,156 --> 00:32:23,362
it's Sarah.

513
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:41,189
- Hey.
- Hi.

514
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,681
- You going to chem?
-Yeah.

515
00:32:57,928 --> 00:32:59,339
What is going on?

516
00:32:59,613 --> 00:33:00,558
No idea.

517
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:03,136
<i>She is such a skanky, slutty whore.</i>

518
00:33:09,907 --> 00:33:11,263
I love this color.

519
00:33:11,729 --> 00:33:13,085
It's tight, right?

520
00:33:14,002 --> 00:33:15,288
This color's tight.

521
00:33:15,551 --> 00:33:17,540
- Whats it?
- Rash.

522
00:33:17,975 --> 00:33:19,291
It's so tight.

523
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,168
I'm a pig.

524
00:33:22,387 --> 00:33:23,798
I look pregnant.

525
00:33:24,332 --> 00:33:26,099
Does it make me look fat?

526
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:27,784
Yes.

527
00:33:28,657 --> 00:33:30,345
What the hell?
What's your problem?

528
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,348
You asked.

529
00:33:34,894 --> 00:33:36,434
Bitch whore much?

530
00:33:37,003 --> 00:33:38,269
I don't understand.

531
00:33:38,675 --> 00:33:39,802
I said

532
00:33:39,922 --> 00:33:42,023
bitch... whore... much?

533
00:33:43,538 --> 00:33:44,817
What are you looking at?

534
00:33:45,616 --> 00:33:47,070
I'm looking at you.

535
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,013
You saw it, right?

536
00:34:15,466 --> 00:34:17,067
Right? You saw it?

537
00:34:17,999 --> 00:34:19,199
It's so...

538
00:34:19,684 --> 00:34:22,355
freakin' big, and right out there!

539
00:34:24,204 --> 00:34:25,300
It's freaking big.

540
00:34:25,476 --> 00:34:26,423
Right.

541
00:34:26,793 --> 00:34:27,902
It is, right?

542
00:34:28,985 --> 00:34:31,280
Whoever's doing this is such a jackass.

543
00:34:32,506 --> 00:34:35,753
I mean, who would do this?
And how would they even know?

544
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,450
My parents...

545
00:34:38,415 --> 00:34:40,058
they're gonna kill me.

546
00:34:40,771 --> 00:34:41,771
Kill me!

547
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:46,962
I mean, don't we have hall monitors?
I mean, how could someone just...

548
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:53,428
You're upset.

549
00:34:55,581 --> 00:34:57,362
No kidding I'm upset.

550
00:34:58,131 --> 00:35:00,143
My life is freaking over!

551
00:35:04,932 --> 00:35:05,982
Here's a present.

552
00:35:08,676 --> 00:35:09,819
It's tight.

553
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:21,870
Well, I have to admit,
I wondered if I'd see you again.

554
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:23,637
Miracles happen every day.

555
00:35:23,757 --> 00:35:24,990
That's funny.

556
00:35:26,086 --> 00:35:27,620
That was a joke, right?

557
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:29,881
If it was funny, it was a joke.

558
00:35:30,001 --> 00:35:33,468
So the... police recommended
I put in a security system.

559
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,069
Armed patrol, that kind of thing.

560
00:35:36,535 --> 00:35:39,533
- Can't really afford it, though.
- You think someone wants the turk?

561
00:35:39,653 --> 00:35:41,080
Eight years of my life.

562
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:43,970
Not just the software.
I customized the hardware too.

563
00:35:44,638 --> 00:35:47,241
One month, I worked
so much on a motherboard

564
00:35:47,753 --> 00:35:50,359
that I lost my sight for three days.

565
00:35:50,721 --> 00:35:51,944
That really happened.

566
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,318
Those circuits are so small.

567
00:35:54,754 --> 00:35:57,867
A lot of the gears I actually pulled
from gaming platforms.

568
00:35:57,987 --> 00:36:00,302
Did you know that
the military uses them?

569
00:36:01,322 --> 00:36:05,357
Yeah, I've got the guts of three Xboxes
and four Playstations daisy-chained.

570
00:36:05,727 --> 00:36:07,411
Plus some seriously modded-out code

571
00:36:07,531 --> 00:36:09,712
that I swear came to me in a dream.

572
00:36:10,498 --> 00:36:13,279
And all this to beat
another computer at chess.

573
00:36:15,005 --> 00:36:17,869
None of this to beat
another computer at chess.

574
00:36:18,923 --> 00:36:19,764
Then what?

575
00:36:21,628 --> 00:36:23,114
What are you doing?

576
00:36:24,978 --> 00:36:27,355
Would you believe me
if I told you turk has moods?

577
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,192
Obviously not in the sense that you
and I understand mood, but sometimes

578
00:36:31,352 --> 00:36:34,403
I'll feed it a particular chess problem,

579
00:36:34,563 --> 00:36:36,446
and it'll solve it one way.

580
00:36:36,607 --> 00:36:38,497
The next day,
I feed it the same problem,

581
00:36:38,617 --> 00:36:39,932
it solves it differently.

582
00:36:40,713 --> 00:36:43,124
Once in a while,
it can't even solve it at all.

583
00:36:43,823 --> 00:36:45,288
Do you know why it does that?

584
00:36:45,713 --> 00:36:46,452
No.

585
00:36:47,411 --> 00:36:48,600
Yeah, neither do I.

586
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,669
Someday...

587
00:36:50,345 --> 00:36:52,000
I'm gonna figure it out.

588
00:36:52,822 --> 00:36:56,008
- Someday, Turk'll tell me.
- You talk about it like it's human.

589
00:36:57,575 --> 00:36:58,928
Well, you never know.

590
00:37:01,287 --> 00:37:02,274
What?

591
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:04,028
Too far?

592
00:37:04,807 --> 00:37:05,810
What is it?

593
00:37:07,903 --> 00:37:08,862
Nothing.

594
00:37:11,013 --> 00:37:12,335
Nothing at all.

595
00:37:22,594 --> 00:37:24,574
Do you like this color on me?

596
00:37:24,835 --> 00:37:25,739
What?

597
00:37:26,407 --> 00:37:27,832
I'm a bitch whore.

598
00:37:28,671 --> 00:37:29,629
What?

599
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:31,875
I have a new friend.

600
00:37:32,614 --> 00:37:34,916
Did she tell you you were a bitch whore?

601
00:37:35,673 --> 00:37:36,943
No. She cried.

602
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,109
Wait... what?

603
00:37:43,326 --> 00:37:45,394
Okay, what the hell is this thing?

604
00:37:46,038 --> 00:37:47,517
Jumper! Outside the gym!

605
00:38:06,014 --> 00:38:06,748
<i>Jump!</i>

606
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:08,074
Jump!

607
00:38:08,657 --> 00:38:10,875
<i>She's not gonna jump.
She's just trying to get attention.</i>

608
00:38:11,351 --> 00:38:13,669
- Jump!
- Dude, come on!

609
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,213
That's my new friend.

610
00:38:16,499 --> 00:38:18,382
The crying one from the bathroom.

611
00:38:21,286 --> 00:38:22,199
When?

612
00:38:23,412 --> 00:38:25,377
Two hours, three minutes ago.

613
00:38:25,692 --> 00:38:26,925
Four minutes ago.

614
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:29,018
She's upset.

615
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,201
Her parents are gonna kill her.

616
00:38:33,583 --> 00:38:35,474
Did you do anything to her?

617
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:39,131
I tried to give her a tight present.

618
00:38:47,976 --> 00:38:49,288
We gotta help her... now!

619
00:38:50,035 --> 00:38:52,124
- No.
- I'm going up there.

620
00:38:54,537 --> 00:38:56,379
Let me go...
I order you to let me go!

621
00:38:57,034 --> 00:38:58,383
Don't be a freak.

622
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,806
Gotta go... now.

623
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:15,499
I could havedone something.

624
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,510
I was right there.

625
00:39:18,633 --> 00:39:19,551
Maybe.

626
00:39:20,896 --> 00:39:22,099
Come on, Mom.

627
00:39:24,017 --> 00:39:26,264
John, people who wanna
take their own lives,

628
00:39:26,384 --> 00:39:27,579
this girl...

629
00:39:27,848 --> 00:39:29,829
if they're serious about it,
they'll find a way.

630
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:32,098
You didn't see her.

631
00:39:33,565 --> 00:39:36,335
If you'd have seen her,
you wouldn't be talking like this.

632
00:39:36,716 --> 00:39:38,587
What were you gonna do, be a hero?

633
00:39:39,786 --> 00:39:42,184
Get your name in the papers, your face?

634
00:39:43,626 --> 00:39:45,511
Isn't that what I'm supposed to be?

635
00:39:45,671 --> 00:39:47,513
A hero? Isn't that who I am?

636
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:49,974
If it's just gonna sit inside me,

637
00:39:50,134 --> 00:39:52,877
if it's just gonna sit in my gut,
then what are we doing?

638
00:39:53,137 --> 00:39:54,548
What's the point?

639
00:39:55,312 --> 00:39:58,455
Why not just give it to them
if we're gonna act like them?

640
00:40:05,869 --> 00:40:07,855
I don't know how to help him.

641
00:40:11,897 --> 00:40:13,414
Andy Goode must be killed.

642
00:41:00,155 --> 00:41:01,443
Took his eyes, James.

643
00:41:03,854 --> 00:41:05,716
He took his friggin' eyes.

644
00:41:19,775 --> 00:41:21,482
<i>On july 16th, 1945,</i>

645
00:41:21,974 --> 00:41:24,898
<i>in the mountains outside
of Los Alamos, New Mexico,</i>

646
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:27,029
<i>the world's first atomic bomb exploded.</i>

647
00:41:29,217 --> 00:41:31,490
<i>A white light pierced the sky
with such intensity</i>

648
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:35,093
<i>that a blind girl claimed to see
the flash from a hundred miles away.</i>

649
00:41:36,156 --> 00:41:37,697
<i>After witnessing the explosion,</i>

650
00:41:37,817 --> 00:41:39,959
<i>J. Robert Oppenheimer quoted a fragment</i>

651
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:42,381
<i>of the Bhagavad Ga, declaring,</i>

652
00:41:42,614 --> 00:41:44,152
<i>"I am become death,</i>

653
00:41:44,272 --> 00:41:45,929
<i>the destroyer of worlds."</i>

654
00:41:50,266 --> 00:41:52,179
<i>His colleague, Ken Bainbridge,</i>

655
00:41:52,434 --> 00:41:54,723
<i>put it another way when
he leaned close to Oppenheimer</i>

656
00:41:54,884 --> 00:41:55,957
<i>and whispered,</i>

657
00:41:56,077 --> 00:41:58,488
<i>"Now we are all sons of bitches."</i>

658
00:42:55,235 --> 00:42:57,853
<i>Now we are all sons of bitches.</i>
