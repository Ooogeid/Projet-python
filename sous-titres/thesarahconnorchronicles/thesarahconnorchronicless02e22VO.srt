00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:02,714
<i>Previously on</i> Terminator:
The Sarah Connor chronicles...

2
00:00:02,839 --> 00:00:04,337
Kaliba was building something.

3
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:07,089
- John Henry was infiltrated.
- Someone out there wants to kill him.

4
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:09,842
- Who's John Henry?
- He's my friend.

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,094
Savannah's survival
may depend upon John Henry.

6
00:00:21,711 --> 00:00:23,728
Why were you at the Weaver house?
Why take the girl?

7
00:00:23,853 --> 00:00:25,843
To protect her.
Girl's in danger.

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,402
You told me I died of cancer.

9
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,612
She's lost weight.

10
00:00:30,123 --> 00:00:32,031
- What?
- Let me talk to Weaver.

11
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:34,075
I'll meet with Sarah Connor.
Make it happen.

12
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:36,202
<i>Put hands behind your head!
Kneel on the ground.</i>

13
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,331
I know you've been told this already,
but as I am a measure twice,

14
00:00:54,456 --> 00:00:55,899
cut once kind of carpenter,

15
00:00:56,024 --> 00:00:58,411
I do want to reiterate
that you have the right to an attorney,

16
00:00:58,536 --> 00:01:01,207
if you are so inclined,
and if you are not so inclined,

17
00:01:01,332 --> 00:01:04,717
anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

18
00:01:07,219 --> 00:01:09,569
Not inclined.
Fair enough and noted.

19
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,595
So here's where we come down
on all this.

20
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,620
Ten years ago, you murdered one
Miles Dyson, employee of Cyberdyne.

21
00:01:17,092 --> 00:01:18,795
Long time gone,
but the man's still dead,

22
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,320
so we've got that.

23
00:01:20,741 --> 00:01:22,045
Eight years ago,

24
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,025
you and your son
and a high school friend of his

25
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,033
blow up a bank vault
and die in the explosion.

26
00:01:27,158 --> 00:01:30,280
Now, of course, you're still alive,
which is inconvenient for many,

27
00:01:30,405 --> 00:01:33,255
but the bank's still blown,
so we've got that.

28
00:01:33,859 --> 00:01:36,508
More recently,
and by that I mean Monday,

29
00:01:36,968 --> 00:01:39,018
you participated in a firefight

30
00:01:39,143 --> 00:01:42,407
leaving five dead and
kidnapping one Savannah Weaver,

31
00:01:42,633 --> 00:01:45,533
daughter of Catherine Weaver
and citizen of Scotland,

32
00:01:45,658 --> 00:01:48,808
making this incident both
federal and international.

33
00:01:49,534 --> 00:01:51,888
Two of the dead
were off-duty law enforcement officers,

34
00:01:52,013 --> 00:01:54,094
and that usually
gets you the needle.

35
00:01:54,219 --> 00:01:56,019
But in that, I do digress.

36
00:01:59,033 --> 00:02:00,283
Agent Aldridge.

37
00:02:01,908 --> 00:02:03,247
You're a funny boy.

38
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,208
Well, that's what mom says.

39
00:02:06,843 --> 00:02:08,593
I never liked funny boys.

40
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,380
I doubt they like you either,
Ms. Connor.

41
00:02:13,908 --> 00:02:15,957
There's two ways I can bring your son
into custody...

42
00:02:16,082 --> 00:02:19,305
With your help, or dead.
Which do you think it should be?

43
00:02:19,594 --> 00:02:21,992
- My son?
- Your son, John Connor.

44
00:02:24,385 --> 00:02:25,535
John is dead.

45
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:27,663
I don't think so.

46
00:02:28,392 --> 00:02:29,482
He died in the bank.

47
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:32,693
I don't think so.
I don't think anyone died in the bank.

48
00:02:32,964 --> 00:02:34,199
Well, you're wrong.

49
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:35,321
Sometimes.

50
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,167
But not today.
Not yet.

51
00:02:40,908 --> 00:02:42,158
Think about it.

52
00:02:50,882 --> 00:02:52,838
<i>... was arrested
and is now in local custody</i>

53
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,590
<i>facing a series of new charges</i>

54
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,283
<i>as well as a host of old ones.</i>

55
00:02:56,408 --> 00:02:59,283
<i>Authorities are also on the lookout
for Connor's son John,</i>

56
00:02:59,408 --> 00:03:02,095
<i>as well as an unidentified
female accomplice.</i>

57
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,642
<i>What you see here are photos
dating back eight years.</i>

58
00:03:05,034 --> 00:03:07,595
<i>Both fugitives would now be
in their mid-20s.</i>

59
00:03:08,356 --> 00:03:10,481
- We should move.
- This motel is out of the way.

60
00:03:10,606 --> 00:03:12,598
The desk clerk could have
clocked us last night.

61
00:03:12,723 --> 00:03:16,523
Relocating within 24 hours
of the incident has high risk factors.

62
00:03:17,339 --> 00:03:19,532
This room provides excellent
sight lines down the highway.

63
00:03:19,701 --> 00:03:21,401
This is not an incident.

64
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,827
This is my mother.

65
00:03:28,537 --> 00:03:31,323
I need a computer.
I need to do research.

66
00:03:32,088 --> 00:03:34,421
You want the blueprints
for the los angeles county jail.

67
00:03:34,596 --> 00:03:35,596
Do I?

68
00:03:35,846 --> 00:03:38,546
So you can plan
how to get your mother out.

69
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:41,669
But I'm not going to let you do that.
You should know that.

70
00:03:41,794 --> 00:03:44,598
- I do know that.
- Then what is there to research?

71
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,092
Power sources.

72
00:03:48,034 --> 00:03:50,020
Shielded nuclear power sources.

73
00:03:52,346 --> 00:03:53,314
Like mine.

74
00:03:54,219 --> 00:03:55,484
Just like yours.

75
00:03:57,887 --> 00:03:59,030
Why?

76
00:03:59,554 --> 00:04:02,825
I wanna know if being around them
all the time can give you cancer.

77
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:35,486
Okay, it's a large room.
It's dark, it's quiet.

78
00:04:35,611 --> 00:04:38,661
It's impossible to see.
You may wanna roll a scan.

79
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,462
I'll roll a scan.

80
00:04:42,635 --> 00:04:43,657
I rolled a one.

81
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,160
One. Tough luck.

82
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:49,038
You don't see the Umber Hulk
as it crawls from its nest

83
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:51,400
in the stone and attacks you.

84
00:04:53,611 --> 00:04:54,767
You take...

85
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:59,446
three hit points of damage
from a bite to the shoulder.

86
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:01,633
I attack the Umber Hulk.

87
00:05:04,048 --> 00:05:04,928
20.

88
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,391
Okay, that's...

89
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:12,662
crit with the Vorpal Longsword
to the Umber Hulk.

90
00:05:13,588 --> 00:05:15,898
Unbelievable. Lucky roll.

91
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:19,151
Hello.

92
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:21,737
I just delivered a crit hit
to the Umber Hulk.

93
00:05:22,077 --> 00:05:23,377
Congratulations.

94
00:05:28,548 --> 00:05:29,798
Who's winning, Mr. Murch?

95
00:05:29,923 --> 00:05:31,747
Well, it's not really
that kind of game.

96
00:05:32,063 --> 00:05:35,125
Although I'm a little bummed
that he killed the Umber Hulk so fast.

97
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:38,587
You've considered the possibility
he can roll whatever number he desires.

98
00:05:41,796 --> 00:05:44,802
How long will it take to disassemble
everything and prepare it for transport?

99
00:05:45,808 --> 00:05:49,475
Everything?
You mean like... everything?

100
00:05:50,423 --> 00:05:52,741
Is that something
you're planning on doing?

101
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:56,522
But John Henry's been attacked once.
We should be prepared.

102
00:05:56,691 --> 00:05:59,295
John Henry was hacked.
We fixed that.

103
00:06:00,484 --> 00:06:03,862
And I think we're past the point
where moving the hardware's a good idea.

104
00:06:03,987 --> 00:06:05,687
In fact, I think it's...

105
00:06:05,858 --> 00:06:08,712
Potentially a really bad idea.

106
00:06:10,605 --> 00:06:11,578
How's that so?

107
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:12,846
For example,

108
00:06:13,343 --> 00:06:16,634
the other day, one of the fan wires
on the server was... glitchy.

109
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:18,359
So we switched it out.

110
00:06:18,547 --> 00:06:20,505
Same wire, same length.
Identical.

111
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,381
Like changing a spark plug.

112
00:06:22,895 --> 00:06:24,645
- And...
- It sort of...

113
00:06:25,705 --> 00:06:26,635
tweaked him.

114
00:06:26,964 --> 00:06:30,116
- I'm not sure what you're getting at.
- What I'm getting at is I think

115
00:06:30,241 --> 00:06:33,283
what we know to be John Henry

116
00:06:34,111 --> 00:06:37,379
only exists
as this specific collection

117
00:06:37,504 --> 00:06:39,286
of hardware and software...

118
00:06:40,751 --> 00:06:41,951
Body and soul.

119
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:44,278
We change a wire,
we change John Henry.

120
00:06:48,047 --> 00:06:50,075
I'm ready to confront
the Mind Flayer now.

121
00:06:52,997 --> 00:06:53,923
20.

122
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:20,355
They followed me to the movie theater.
I didn't know, I swear.

123
00:07:21,172 --> 00:07:24,389
I spent the last hours convincing them
we weren't in this together.

124
00:07:24,568 --> 00:07:26,653
Maybe I should tell them we were.

125
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:29,323
Maybe we were in this together.

126
00:07:31,841 --> 00:07:33,369
I just wanted the girl to be safe.

127
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:35,048
- So did I.
- From whom?

128
00:07:35,173 --> 00:07:37,790
- I don't know.
- You don't know, or you can't say?

129
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,292
I don't know, but if I did,
I probably couldn't say.

130
00:07:42,114 --> 00:07:44,417
They wanna know what you've been doing
for the last ten years.

131
00:07:44,542 --> 00:07:45,971
What'd you tell them?

132
00:07:46,985 --> 00:07:49,718
I told them I have no idea
what you've been doing.

133
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:52,637
What else could I tell them?

134
00:07:53,547 --> 00:07:54,947
You can tell them.

135
00:07:55,862 --> 00:07:57,768
You can tell them
everything you've been doing.

136
00:07:58,235 --> 00:07:59,525
You can draw them a picture

137
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:02,600
of everything they know
and everything you know.

138
00:08:03,736 --> 00:08:06,099
If you're innocent,
you could do that.

139
00:08:06,224 --> 00:08:08,446
The last time I drew a picture...

140
00:08:09,297 --> 00:08:11,147
I ended up in a psych ward.

141
00:08:11,813 --> 00:08:14,034
Maybe things will be different now.

142
00:08:14,235 --> 00:08:16,829
Maybe you got nothing to lose.

143
00:08:18,491 --> 00:08:20,641
There's always something to lose.

144
00:08:21,658 --> 00:08:23,238
I am sorry for this.

145
00:08:24,098 --> 00:08:25,170
Sure you are.

146
00:08:29,538 --> 00:08:30,551
Where's the girl?

147
00:08:30,956 --> 00:08:33,883
Back with her mother.
Where else would a child be?

148
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,305
She's not safe.

149
00:08:41,752 --> 00:08:43,174
She's not safe.

150
00:08:48,446 --> 00:08:49,696
<i>She's not safe.</i>

Subtitles: Projet-SG

153
00:09:15,862 --> 00:09:18,012
- Agent?
- Mr. Ellison, come in.

154
00:09:18,696 --> 00:09:19,696
It's open.

155
00:09:25,993 --> 00:09:27,548
This is where they stick us now.

156
00:09:27,673 --> 00:09:31,236
Pretty sure I know what the subtext is,
but I refuse to read that deep.

157
00:09:33,549 --> 00:09:35,499
She's not budging on the son.

158
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:37,284
Maybe she's telling the truth.

159
00:09:37,612 --> 00:09:41,049
Maybe she's a liar lacking
the proper motivation to tell the truth.

160
00:09:41,174 --> 00:09:43,374
But she's got a guilty conscience.

161
00:09:43,626 --> 00:09:44,996
What makes you think that?

162
00:09:45,687 --> 00:09:47,878
For starters,
she's requested a priest.

163
00:09:48,428 --> 00:09:49,428
What?

164
00:09:49,845 --> 00:09:51,862
Man of the cloth in the flesh.

165
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,800
Black and white and God all over.

166
00:09:54,157 --> 00:09:56,550
Father Armando Bonilla ring a bell?

167
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,432
Can't imagine
what the connection is.

168
00:10:00,705 --> 00:10:03,101
Did it ever occur to you
she might just wanna pray?

169
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,611
Not for a second.

170
00:10:04,736 --> 00:10:06,723
It occurs to me
that other than a lawyer,

171
00:10:06,848 --> 00:10:09,193
a priest is the only other person
she could ask to speak with

172
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:10,692
that we can't listen to.

173
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,995
<i>Buenos dias</i>, Father.

174
00:10:24,705 --> 00:10:26,155
Do you remember me?

175
00:10:30,228 --> 00:10:33,049
You and your son were in my church.

176
00:10:34,427 --> 00:10:36,927
There was a problem
with your daughter.

177
00:10:37,988 --> 00:10:40,222
At least, that is what you told me.

178
00:10:41,502 --> 00:10:42,852
She's better now.

179
00:10:43,238 --> 00:10:44,351
Where is she?

180
00:10:44,847 --> 00:10:46,147
She's in hiding.

181
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:48,689
With my son.
I don't know where.

182
00:10:48,858 --> 00:10:50,358
And they are wanted.

183
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:52,651
You have included them
in your crimes.

184
00:10:57,924 --> 00:10:59,825
Do you believe in the Devil, Father?

185
00:11:01,363 --> 00:11:02,363
The Devil.

186
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:06,290
Do you believe in the actual Devil?

187
00:11:08,026 --> 00:11:09,966
Something opposes God.

188
00:11:11,073 --> 00:11:13,704
Something tempts man into sin.

189
00:11:15,192 --> 00:11:17,361
I don't know about God or heaven...

190
00:11:19,489 --> 00:11:23,489
but I do believe someone or something
wants this world to burn...

191
00:11:23,943 --> 00:11:25,859
The Devil, demons...

192
00:11:27,634 --> 00:11:28,634
I believe.

193
00:11:30,801 --> 00:11:33,451
And that day in the church,
my daughter...

194
00:11:35,313 --> 00:11:37,163
You saw things, didn't you?

195
00:11:38,587 --> 00:11:39,587
I pray...

196
00:11:40,721 --> 00:11:42,938
every day to understand...

197
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,049
what happened that day.

198
00:11:46,736 --> 00:11:48,503
I can explain it to you.

199
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:52,992
I don't know if you'll believe me,
but I can explain it to you.

200
00:11:53,201 --> 00:11:56,717
And after I'm done, I'm gonna ask you
to do something for me.

201
00:11:57,426 --> 00:11:59,051
Will you do something for me?

202
00:12:06,242 --> 00:12:08,202
Mr. Ellison, welcome back.

203
00:12:08,926 --> 00:12:10,812
How are your friends
in law enforcement?

204
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,482
How are your friends
in law enforcement, Mr. Ellison?

205
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:15,525
They're very determined.

206
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:16,952
What is this?

207
00:12:17,868 --> 00:12:19,738
Sarah Connor
is talking with a priest.

208
00:12:19,992 --> 00:12:21,615
Father Armando Bonilla.

209
00:12:21,803 --> 00:12:23,053
I can see that.

210
00:12:23,488 --> 00:12:26,036
Why is it here?
Why are you watching it?

211
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:28,928
John Henry monitors
all law enforcement channels.

212
00:12:29,114 --> 00:12:30,332
Seems prudent.

213
00:12:30,698 --> 00:12:32,048
It seems illegal.

214
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:34,144
So's lying to the FBI.

215
00:12:35,006 --> 00:12:37,646
I don't think now's the time to be
parsing which laws we'll be obeying

216
00:12:37,771 --> 00:12:40,050
- and which we will not.
- Now's not the time.

217
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:41,635
I heard her when she said it.

218
00:12:44,082 --> 00:12:46,848
- Those cameras should be off.
- I want to meet him.

219
00:12:47,797 --> 00:12:48,809
The priest?

220
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:50,274
No, the boy.

221
00:12:50,688 --> 00:12:52,312
You wanna meet John Connor?

222
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,117
Someone's attacked my family.

223
00:12:54,242 --> 00:12:55,842
They may attack again.

224
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,230
I think he knows something.

225
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,691
And besides, he saved my daughter...

226
00:13:02,178 --> 00:13:04,199
- And I want to thank him.
- Thank you.

227
00:13:05,888 --> 00:13:07,388
Can we talk outside?

228
00:13:16,531 --> 00:13:17,831
It's a bad idea.

229
00:13:18,115 --> 00:13:19,840
I don't know what you think
John knows.

230
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:23,259
I know he was at my house
when the attacker showed up.

231
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,769
I want to know why.

232
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:27,419
His mother thinks he's a messiah.

233
00:13:27,626 --> 00:13:29,061
I want to know why.

234
00:13:29,186 --> 00:13:31,192
And despite your reluctance
to tell me,

235
00:13:31,317 --> 00:13:33,917
I surmise that he
and his cyber companion

236
00:13:34,174 --> 00:13:37,781
are connected to the John Henry body,
and I want to know why.

237
00:13:40,423 --> 00:13:41,673
She's a cyborg.

238
00:13:42,495 --> 00:13:43,864
Don't pretend you didn't know.

239
00:13:45,768 --> 00:13:46,992
She's dangerous.

240
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:49,761
And you think I need protecting.

241
00:13:50,185 --> 00:13:51,335
That's sweet.

242
00:13:52,114 --> 00:13:54,164
But don't ever lie to me again.

243
00:13:54,614 --> 00:13:57,294
Now... about John Connor...

244
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:58,920
I don't know how to find him.

245
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,510
Well, I do.

246
00:14:03,258 --> 00:14:04,175
20!

247
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:16,396
Can I help you?

248
00:14:19,163 --> 00:14:19,941
How?

249
00:14:24,366 --> 00:14:26,378
- Ammo?
- Silencers.

250
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:29,209
You know we can't sell
that kinda stuff.

251
00:14:39,414 --> 00:14:40,629
Ask to speak to Manny.

252
00:14:41,178 --> 00:14:42,714
I want to speak to Manny.

253
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:45,879
Call the number first.
Then ask.

254
00:14:52,795 --> 00:14:56,353
I always thought the best things
about those guns was the sound.

255
00:14:58,461 --> 00:14:59,866
No. It's not.

256
00:15:10,283 --> 00:15:12,233
How much weight has she lost?

257
00:15:14,843 --> 00:15:16,861
You think she has cancer
because she's lost weight.

258
00:15:16,986 --> 00:15:18,458
So how much weight has she lost?

259
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:21,545
11% of her mass
in the last six weeks.

260
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,480
She was healthy
before you showed up.

261
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,684
That's all I know.
She was healthy.

262
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:39,151
If my power source was
leaking radiation, I would know.

263
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,130
I have sensors for that.

264
00:15:41,805 --> 00:15:44,192
- Where are they?
- You can't see them.

265
00:15:46,423 --> 00:15:47,823
No, of course not.

266
00:15:48,054 --> 00:15:49,656
So I just have to trust you on it.

267
00:15:51,626 --> 00:15:53,702
Stuff does go wrong
with you, doesn't it?

268
00:15:55,447 --> 00:15:56,697
Stuff breaks...

269
00:15:57,768 --> 00:16:00,113
You kill birds, you twitch.

270
00:16:02,864 --> 00:16:04,414
You try to murder me.

271
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,084
You're not perfect.

272
00:16:10,306 --> 00:16:11,656
You're a machine.

273
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:19,603
Mom!

274
00:16:22,429 --> 00:16:23,857
Yes, I remember you.

275
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,830
<i>Buenos dias</i> to you too, Father.

276
00:17:00,336 --> 00:17:02,354
Underneath the bench,
there is an envelope.

277
00:17:02,862 --> 00:17:05,788
I hope it is enough.
Is all I could find.

278
00:17:08,681 --> 00:17:10,831
I have a message for you as well.

279
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:19,764
What's wrong?

280
00:18:22,438 --> 00:18:24,018
The ids are flawless.

281
00:18:25,712 --> 00:18:26,771
They're flawless.

282
00:18:30,177 --> 00:18:32,027
There's nothing else there.

283
00:18:34,843 --> 00:18:36,793
There's nothing hidden there.

284
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:41,661
No secret message there
for her escape.

285
00:18:42,807 --> 00:18:45,586
I am to tell you this.
From your mother.

286
00:18:46,676 --> 00:18:47,950
Leave this place.

287
00:18:48,729 --> 00:18:50,003
As soon as it is safe.

288
00:18:51,117 --> 00:18:52,467
Leave this place.

289
00:18:54,569 --> 00:18:57,581
Do not think of her.
Do not come for her.

290
00:18:59,081 --> 00:19:00,081
Leave.

291
00:19:06,033 --> 00:19:07,854
You are to make sure that he does.

292
00:19:22,572 --> 00:19:24,372
We lose everybody we love.

293
00:19:28,727 --> 00:19:29,959
She said that?

294
00:19:52,809 --> 00:19:53,942
That's interesting.

295
00:20:04,428 --> 00:20:05,662
Let me repeat.

296
00:20:06,312 --> 00:20:08,497
I had nothing to do
with your mother's arrest.

297
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,291
If I had...

298
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:13,002
there'd be a SWAT team
outside your door right now.

299
00:20:14,872 --> 00:20:17,632
The same thing would happen to this
swat team as happened to your last one.

300
00:20:22,413 --> 00:20:24,597
Catherine Weaver
would like to meet you.

301
00:20:25,103 --> 00:20:26,103
Why?

302
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:28,308
She wants to thank you
for saving Savannah.

303
00:20:28,871 --> 00:20:30,228
Well, she just did.

304
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,564
Your mother wanted to meet her.

305
00:20:34,198 --> 00:20:36,692
Well, when my mother gets out,
trust me, she will.

306
00:20:37,439 --> 00:20:40,290
I told Ms. Weaver you'd never come
without your mom.

307
00:20:41,118 --> 00:20:43,227
She said, if that was the case,

308
00:20:43,813 --> 00:20:45,818
I'm supposed to ask one question.

309
00:20:47,782 --> 00:20:49,581
She says I'm supposed to ask you.

310
00:20:52,081 --> 00:20:53,209
Will you join us?

311
00:20:55,226 --> 00:20:57,629
She says she hopes
you'll know what that means.

312
00:20:58,898 --> 00:21:00,466
Do you know what that means?

313
00:21:02,957 --> 00:21:04,323
No, I don't.

314
00:21:06,313 --> 00:21:08,337
Please leave now, Mr. Ellison.

315
00:21:08,462 --> 00:21:09,893
I think you've said enough.

316
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,420
You've said enough, Mr. Ellison.

317
00:21:14,713 --> 00:21:16,274
I won't ask you again.

318
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:36,940
He upset you.

319
00:21:38,336 --> 00:21:39,336
Me?

320
00:21:40,658 --> 00:21:41,799
I think he upset you.

321
00:21:43,674 --> 00:21:45,136
You know that's impossible.

322
00:21:46,566 --> 00:21:47,566
Is it?

323
00:21:49,172 --> 00:21:50,865
You said it yourself, John.

324
00:21:51,439 --> 00:21:52,776
I'm just a machine.

325
00:22:12,367 --> 00:22:13,539
I believe you.

326
00:22:16,099 --> 00:22:17,480
You believe me what?

327
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,380
I believe there are machines.

328
00:22:20,991 --> 00:22:23,301
I believe they've come back
from the future to first kill you

329
00:22:23,426 --> 00:22:24,634
and then your son.

330
00:22:25,403 --> 00:22:28,405
I believe in time travel.
I believe in cyborgs.

331
00:22:28,974 --> 00:22:32,356
I believe there's a world
that I've not yet seen but you have...

332
00:22:32,481 --> 00:22:33,481
and John.

333
00:22:34,767 --> 00:22:37,086
In the last eight hours,
I've received 37 calls

334
00:22:37,211 --> 00:22:39,983
from people who have met
a young man named John Baum

335
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:43,186
or his sister Cameron
or Sarah Baum the mother.

336
00:22:43,964 --> 00:22:45,780
They now know her
to be Sarah Connor.

337
00:22:47,214 --> 00:22:50,026
By all accounts,
your son looks 16 and not 24,

338
00:22:50,151 --> 00:22:52,708
just as you look 35 and not 43.

339
00:22:54,074 --> 00:22:57,215
I believe you have participated
in the miraculous and the terrible,

340
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:01,043
and through it all, you have maintained
a moral and good soul.

341
00:23:02,099 --> 00:23:03,477
I want to help you.

342
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:06,009
I want to help your son.

343
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:08,880
Help me do that.

344
00:23:18,615 --> 00:23:19,788
My son is dead.

345
00:23:39,878 --> 00:23:41,711
Do you know who Danny Dyson is?

346
00:23:42,185 --> 00:23:43,185
Danny?

347
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:45,751
Miles Dyson's son.

348
00:23:46,345 --> 00:23:47,716
Do you know where he is?

349
00:23:50,754 --> 00:23:51,754
Why?

350
00:23:52,433 --> 00:23:54,423
He's been missing for three months.

351
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,085
You the guy
who smashed through my gate?

352
00:24:30,254 --> 00:24:31,844
I liked that gate.

353
00:24:32,661 --> 00:24:33,846
Catherine Weaver?

354
00:24:34,842 --> 00:24:35,681
Sure.

355
00:25:08,525 --> 00:25:11,450
The chip has been treated
with a phosphorous compound.

356
00:25:11,779 --> 00:25:14,142
- When exposed to oxygen...
- It burns up.

357
00:25:14,267 --> 00:25:16,495
I know what happened.
I saw it happen.

358
00:25:16,774 --> 00:25:18,307
Can any data be recovered?

359
00:25:19,068 --> 00:25:20,935
I can try, but it's highly doubtful.

360
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:24,063
We need to know
what it knows, who sent it.

361
00:25:25,042 --> 00:25:27,525
It's safe to assume
my brother sent it.

362
00:25:30,475 --> 00:25:31,821
Where have you been?

363
00:25:32,749 --> 00:25:35,937
Where have I been?
It's 7:00 in the morning. I been asleep.

364
00:25:36,339 --> 00:25:39,378
- Didn't you get my message?
- It was very disappointing.

365
00:25:39,842 --> 00:25:42,038
Did you give the message
exactly as I said it?

366
00:25:42,213 --> 00:25:43,213
Of course.

367
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:45,182
Look, I told you before.

368
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:48,171
She'll never leave his side,
and he'll never leave his mother's.

369
00:25:48,965 --> 00:25:50,005
We'll see.

370
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:02,919
Don't do that.

371
00:26:05,652 --> 00:26:08,108
My mom used to do that.
I really hate that.

372
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:12,853
What's goin' on?

373
00:26:13,509 --> 00:26:15,448
You need to understand how it works.

374
00:26:17,149 --> 00:26:18,034
What?

375
00:26:18,432 --> 00:26:19,432
This chip.

376
00:26:20,276 --> 00:26:21,276
This body.

377
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,143
The software is designed
to terminate humans.

378
00:26:26,257 --> 00:26:28,651
The hardware is designed
to terminate humans.

379
00:26:28,776 --> 00:26:30,213
That's our sole function.

380
00:26:31,398 --> 00:26:32,398
Not you.

381
00:26:34,786 --> 00:26:36,046
Not anymore.

382
00:26:37,192 --> 00:26:39,182
But what was there is still there.

383
00:26:40,327 --> 00:26:41,891
And will always be there.

384
00:26:44,289 --> 00:26:45,492
So down deep...

385
00:26:47,414 --> 00:26:48,731
you wanna kill me.

386
00:26:50,445 --> 00:26:51,445
I do.

387
00:26:57,707 --> 00:26:59,116
Then why don't you?

388
00:27:00,586 --> 00:27:01,818
I might someday.

389
00:27:05,065 --> 00:27:06,862
I need to show you something.

390
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,028
This body...

391
00:27:34,365 --> 00:27:35,569
Get on top of me.

392
00:27:38,449 --> 00:27:39,785
Put your knee here.

393
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,130
Right here.

394
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,694
If I'm damaged, we should know.

395
00:28:14,566 --> 00:28:17,031
Reach down under the breast plate.

396
00:28:26,936 --> 00:28:27,705
There.

397
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,793
What does it feel like?

398
00:28:35,962 --> 00:28:36,962
Cold.

399
00:28:40,745 --> 00:28:42,112
That's good, right?

400
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,094
That's good.

401
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:47,545
That's perfect.

402
00:28:59,585 --> 00:29:00,768
It's time to go.

403
00:29:20,146 --> 00:29:21,342
It's right here.

404
00:29:22,673 --> 00:29:23,427
Door!

405
00:29:31,976 --> 00:29:33,270
You did what I asked?

406
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:34,439
I did.

407
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,190
And?

408
00:29:36,642 --> 00:29:37,650
Why are you here?

409
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:40,467
They have a message for you.

410
00:29:41,272 --> 00:29:42,366
She's coming.

411
00:29:51,462 --> 00:29:52,665
I don't know what to do.

412
00:29:53,409 --> 00:29:54,686
You're a priest.

413
00:29:55,325 --> 00:29:56,325
Pray.

414
00:31:03,567 --> 00:31:05,863
What's that Bible story,
the one where the locks fall off?

415
00:31:07,084 --> 00:31:09,366
- Peter.
- Yeah. That's a good one.

416
00:31:14,264 --> 00:31:15,348
Gird thyself.

417
00:31:57,826 --> 00:31:59,300
There's been a bit of an incident.

418
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:01,841
At the jail?

419
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:05,631
Any idea how it started?

420
00:32:07,209 --> 00:32:08,273
Look there.

421
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:16,243
And there.

422
00:32:20,246 --> 00:32:21,656
You look like hell.

423
00:32:22,334 --> 00:32:23,552
Can you keep up?

424
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:48,632
I sent you a message.
I told you...

425
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,968
Yeah, bad John Connor.
Ground me.

426
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,022
Are you okay?

427
00:32:55,417 --> 00:32:56,902
I'm not 100%.

428
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:00,436
How far from 100% are you?

429
00:33:01,898 --> 00:33:02,771
Why?

430
00:33:03,207 --> 00:33:04,958
'Cause I need to meet
Catherine Weaver.

431
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:07,234
And she needs to destroy
whatever's in that basement.

432
00:33:16,749 --> 00:33:18,828
I really wish
we weren't here right now.

433
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:23,250
Savannah could tell them
we know about Cromartie.

434
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,204
- John Henry now.
- Metal.

435
00:33:26,667 --> 00:33:28,731
If she tells them, they'll move it.

436
00:33:29,065 --> 00:33:32,282
- Maybe they already have.
- Well, we'll know soon enough.

437
00:33:41,351 --> 00:33:42,794
Mom, are you sick?

438
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,690
Cameron thinks you're sick.

439
00:33:48,017 --> 00:33:49,017
She does?

440
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:55,309
You've lost weight.

441
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,248
I love you.

442
00:34:21,332 --> 00:34:22,567
Where's Cameron?

443
00:34:22,938 --> 00:34:24,037
In the car.

444
00:34:25,215 --> 00:34:26,567
Expecting trouble?

445
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,805
No change for the meter.

446
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:32,466
You're not armed, are you?

447
00:34:32,898 --> 00:34:34,205
Expecting trouble?

448
00:34:35,394 --> 00:34:36,745
No reason for that.

449
00:34:37,864 --> 00:34:39,141
No reason at all.

450
00:35:02,914 --> 00:35:03,914
Hello.

451
00:35:05,084 --> 00:35:06,061
Hello.

452
00:35:07,156 --> 00:35:08,206
I know you.

453
00:35:09,835 --> 00:35:10,835
And I know you.

454
00:35:12,407 --> 00:35:13,652
Will you join us?

455
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:33,714
So why are we here?

456
00:35:33,883 --> 00:35:35,733
- We need...
- Let me restate.

457
00:35:36,284 --> 00:35:38,081
We're here first and foremost

458
00:35:38,459 --> 00:35:41,869
so I can thank you for your heroism
regarding my daughter Savannah.

459
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:44,894
She's the light of my life,
and I'd be lost without her.

460
00:35:45,102 --> 00:35:46,226
Where is she?

461
00:35:46,781 --> 00:35:47,978
Let's assume school.

462
00:35:50,585 --> 00:35:52,021
We have a common enemy...

463
00:35:52,146 --> 00:35:55,360
One we cannot fight with conventional
weapons or by conventional means.

464
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:57,654
Kaliba?
Don't presume to know Kaliba.

465
00:35:57,922 --> 00:36:00,365
I'm sorry.
I wasn't speaking to you.

466
00:36:02,249 --> 00:36:03,660
I was speaking to you...

467
00:36:03,931 --> 00:36:04,995
about Skynet.

468
00:36:06,259 --> 00:36:08,623
Savannah's told you
about John Henry, I assume.

469
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:12,522
Which is why your cyborg
is skulking around my basement.

470
00:36:12,907 --> 00:36:14,254
What the hell...

471
00:36:18,447 --> 00:36:19,531
Get down.

472
00:36:41,093 --> 00:36:42,093
Run!

473
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:09,035
The basement.

474
00:37:13,691 --> 00:37:15,691
We need to get out.
They're trying to kill my son.

475
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:18,527
No. They're trying to kill my son,
just like you are.

476
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:20,863
- I'm sure she's done it.
- You better hope not.

477
00:37:21,167 --> 00:37:23,740
Your John may save the world,
but he can't do it without mine.

478
00:37:41,957 --> 00:37:43,507
Her chip. It's gone.

479
00:37:47,552 --> 00:37:50,767
Where is he, the... John Henry?
He took her chip. Where did he go?

480
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:53,604
He didn't take the chip.

481
00:37:54,257 --> 00:37:55,397
She gave it to him.

482
00:38:07,976 --> 00:38:08,911
Where is he?

483
00:38:09,317 --> 00:38:10,456
Not where.

484
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:12,390
When.

485
00:38:13,652 --> 00:38:15,792
What?
What do you mean, when?

486
00:38:17,564 --> 00:38:19,038
I know that.
I've seen it before.

487
00:38:23,606 --> 00:38:26,323
Is that the Turk?
It's Andy Goode's Turk.

488
00:38:28,778 --> 00:38:29,828
Three dots.

489
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,252
You lying Terminator bitch.

490
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:38,893
You're building Skynet.

491
00:38:40,499 --> 00:38:42,682
I was building
something to fight it.

492
00:38:43,262 --> 00:38:45,579
And I'd watch
who's calling who a bitch.

493
00:38:48,874 --> 00:38:50,827
- Coming, James?
- Coming?

494
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:52,251
After John Henry.

495
00:38:53,037 --> 00:38:54,967
- Our boy.
- He's not my boy.

496
00:38:55,803 --> 00:38:58,460
- And you...
- Do you mind picking up Savannah then?

497
00:38:58,765 --> 00:39:00,629
Gymnastics ends at 5:30.

498
00:39:10,818 --> 00:39:12,057
John, we can't.

499
00:39:13,898 --> 00:39:14,977
He's got her chip.

500
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,204
He's got her.

501
00:39:28,545 --> 00:39:29,491
Mom.

502
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:31,185
I'll stop it.

503
00:40:11,454 --> 00:40:12,635
Where's Cameron?

504
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:15,454
- Where's her body?
- It doesn't go through.

505
00:40:54,814 --> 00:40:55,814
Got one!

506
00:40:56,872 --> 00:40:58,454
- Got one!
- One what? What?

507
00:41:01,962 --> 00:41:03,459
Please. I'm not metal.

508
00:41:03,629 --> 00:41:04,896
Don't move... don't move!

509
00:41:05,021 --> 00:41:07,130
Please! I swear I haven't got anything!
I'm human!

510
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,496
- 'Cause I will blast you!
- Stand down.

511
00:41:20,805 --> 00:41:22,171
Look in his eyes.

512
00:41:22,527 --> 00:41:25,081
He's got about as much metal
in him as you do.

513
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,400
Derek.

514
00:41:27,499 --> 00:41:28,499
Yeah?

515
00:41:30,042 --> 00:41:31,042
John.

516
00:41:35,412 --> 00:41:36,511
John Connor.

517
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:40,341
I know a lot of people, kid.
Don't know you.

518
00:41:41,882 --> 00:41:43,961
Anybody heard the name John Connor?

519
00:41:49,641 --> 00:41:50,839
You know what?

520
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,861
I think you're gonna be famous.

521
00:41:54,632 --> 00:41:57,055
My brother's back,
and you're wearing his coat.

522
00:43:03,621 --> 00:43:04,891
I love you too.
