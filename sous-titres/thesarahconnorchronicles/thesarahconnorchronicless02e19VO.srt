The Sarah Connor Chronicles.

00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,884
You're stuck in a can under the ocean
with one of those things.

3
00:00:06,009 --> 00:00:08,007
Don't worry about Queeg.
He's a good bloke.

4
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:09,357
He's not on our side.

5
00:00:09,584 --> 00:00:11,135
Why are we 300 miles off course?

6
00:00:11,304 --> 00:00:12,845
Our orders come from John Connor.

7
00:00:13,014 --> 00:00:14,983
Dietz and his team
will retrieve a package.

8
00:00:15,108 --> 00:00:17,308
We will deliver this package
to Serrano Point.

9
00:00:17,477 --> 00:00:19,310
Connor sent me.
I've come for that.

10
00:00:19,702 --> 00:00:23,105
- What's happening with you?
- I've planted an explosive in my skull.

11
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:25,816
I know.
Riley's dead.

12
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:27,943
- Cameron didn't to it.
- How can you be so sure?

13
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:30,780
- She told me.
- Just like she told you she loved you.

14
00:00:31,783 --> 00:00:33,157
You don't know anything.

15
00:00:39,574 --> 00:00:41,165
I'm really sorry, John.

16
00:00:44,713 --> 00:00:47,712
She was a good kid.
She didn't deserve what happened to her.

17
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,960
Few people do.

18
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:56,847
How long do you think
you could survive...

19
00:01:00,974 --> 00:01:02,224
with Cameron...

20
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:06,688
if she wanted to kill you...
face to face?

21
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:13,009
What kind of weapon do I have?

22
00:01:15,628 --> 00:01:16,763
Your fists.

23
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:19,750
And your elbows.

24
00:01:20,262 --> 00:01:22,164
And your fingernails.
And your teeth.

25
00:01:23,447 --> 00:01:24,500
Against her?

26
00:01:26,414 --> 00:01:27,837
Those aren't weapons.

27
00:01:28,284 --> 00:01:29,584
No, they're not.

28
00:01:33,887 --> 00:01:36,537
You already know
the answer to that, John.

29
00:01:38,045 --> 00:01:39,849
If she wants me dead, I'm dead.

30
00:01:40,018 --> 00:01:42,118
She wants you dead, you're dead.

31
00:01:44,322 --> 00:01:46,022
What are you getting at?

32
00:01:48,188 --> 00:01:50,238
I wanna talk about something.

33
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:53,320
All right.

34
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,760
I wanna talk to you
about the future.

35
00:01:58,077 --> 00:01:58,867
Yours?

36
00:02:00,323 --> 00:02:01,323
Yours.

37
00:02:57,976 --> 00:02:59,345
<i>Carter, this is ASDS.</i>

38
00:03:00,035 --> 00:03:02,431
<i>Package is secure.
Standing by for all-clear.</i>

39
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,099
Visual on the package, ASDS?

40
00:03:04,448 --> 00:03:05,559
<i>Visual, aye-aye.</i>

41
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,357
- What the heck is that?
- It's Connor's box.

42
00:03:11,638 --> 00:03:13,108
- All we know?
- All we know.

43
00:03:25,804 --> 00:03:26,872
Little help?

44
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,263
Captain?

45
00:03:33,364 --> 00:03:35,756
I will secure the package
in the magazine.

46
00:03:36,043 --> 00:03:37,299
Authorized access only.

47
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:51,038
You wanna let us little people know
what's in the box,

48
00:03:51,181 --> 00:03:54,441
or is it classified between
you and Queeg?

49
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,319
It's between Queeg and Queeg.
I don't know a damn thing.

50
00:03:58,621 --> 00:04:01,991
And that doesn't bother you,
metal keeping secrets from skin?

51
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:04,473
No. It doesn't.

52
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:06,245
Not even a little.

53
00:04:06,472 --> 00:04:08,044
Well, it should.

54
00:04:08,461 --> 00:04:10,499
And not just a little, but a lot.

55
00:04:11,388 --> 00:04:13,761
We were sent to pick up
the box and bring it back.

56
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:16,297
So we're picking up the box
and bringing it back.

57
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,511
And one of us should know why.

58
00:04:19,271 --> 00:04:21,677
One of us, not just one of them.

59
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:24,563
One of us knows.
His name's John Connor.

60
00:04:30,428 --> 00:04:32,438
You think those things work for us?

61
00:04:32,987 --> 00:04:34,440
Look around you.

62
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,291
We work for them.

63
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:39,390
Haulin' ass through the worst
of Indian country.

64
00:04:39,515 --> 00:04:40,357
For what?

65
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,948
To take a damn box back to Serrano?

66
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,888
- Connor needs it.
- Connor?

67
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:48,189
Connor is so into
his big chess match with Skynet,

68
00:04:48,358 --> 00:04:51,123
he doesn't even see how the tin cans
got us right where they want us.

69
00:04:51,641 --> 00:04:54,841
Metal on every base
running the show in all but name.

70
00:04:55,661 --> 00:04:56,761
Just waiting

71
00:04:57,306 --> 00:04:59,882
to hit us all at once
with something big.

72
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,552
Maybe...
something that's in that box.

73
00:05:03,827 --> 00:05:04,970
Break time's over.

74
00:05:05,696 --> 00:05:08,057
Those of you on watch
get to your stations.

75
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,394
Get to your rack. I don't wanna see you
till forenoon watch.

76
00:05:13,472 --> 00:05:15,981
"Yes, ma'am."
That's what you say.

77
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,585
You're a good sailor.

78
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,448
But the pressure's starting
to get to you.

79
00:05:26,762 --> 00:05:28,937
So what's getting to you, ma'am?

80
00:05:59,168 --> 00:06:00,484
You went to see the body.

81
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:05,524
You shouldn't have done that.

82
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,631
It was a risk. I know.

83
00:06:15,857 --> 00:06:17,543
I don't mean the risk.

84
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,386
You shouldn't have
to remember her like that.

85
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,561
That's all.

86
00:06:34,584 --> 00:06:36,784
There were things I needed to see.

87
00:06:38,824 --> 00:06:40,774
And that I had to understand.

88
00:06:43,311 --> 00:06:45,161
Do you understand them now?

89
00:06:47,347 --> 00:06:48,397
I think so.

90
00:06:53,825 --> 00:06:55,330
I'm sorry I doubted you.

91
00:07:01,248 --> 00:07:02,724
Not you. Her.

92
00:07:30,737 --> 00:07:33,744
We lost a day
evading the ASW bots near Fiji.

93
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,511
We'll take a more direct route
to make up the time.

94
00:07:36,636 --> 00:07:38,165
Make sure the crew is prepared.

95
00:07:38,334 --> 00:07:40,334
Queeg, this crew...

96
00:07:40,677 --> 00:07:43,433
can sneak through the gates of hell
and back if it has to.

97
00:07:43,558 --> 00:07:44,880
But they're not machines.

98
00:07:45,403 --> 00:07:48,010
They work better
if they have a reason.

99
00:07:49,141 --> 00:07:52,262
If they know why you expect them
to perform miracles.

100
00:07:52,665 --> 00:07:55,075
This crew will do their job
because that's what's required

101
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,142
to survive and complete the mission.

102
00:07:57,808 --> 00:07:59,058
You understand.

103
00:08:01,427 --> 00:08:03,082
Motion detectors in the hold.

104
00:08:03,207 --> 00:08:05,412
Unauthorized access to our cargo.

105
00:08:18,404 --> 00:08:21,291
- Dietz, what the hell did you do?
- Could be anything in there.

106
00:08:21,549 --> 00:08:23,627
A machine, a bomb. Anything.

107
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,047
And we'll be just gonna run it
right through the front door to Serrano.

108
00:08:27,631 --> 00:08:28,715
At least we know.

109
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,911
- Of all the stupid things...
- The stupid?

110
00:08:31,036 --> 00:08:33,053
Stupid is taking their word for it.

111
00:08:33,441 --> 00:08:34,591
For anything.

112
00:08:35,866 --> 00:08:38,392
- I'm not afraid of that thing.
- Well then, be afraid of me.

113
00:08:38,896 --> 00:08:39,767
Guys.

114
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,432
You spend any time

115
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,658
in a work camp, Commander?

116
00:08:47,424 --> 00:08:49,570
- Guys.
- You don't get to tell me anything.

117
00:08:50,043 --> 00:08:51,893
And neither does the metal.

118
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,115
Guys, look!

119
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:08,338
Metal!

120
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:37,618
I told you. This is what happens!
This is what they do.

121
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:40,287
Pull his chip and make him tell us
what the hell is going on.

122
00:09:43,241 --> 00:09:45,264
We divide into search parties.

123
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,670
We turn this boat over stem from stern
until we find that thing.

124
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:51,757
- We're gonna need guns.
- Commander Flores,

125
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,968
secure all sidearms
and plasma rifles.

126
00:09:55,824 --> 00:09:58,764
Take Petty Officer Goodnow's body
to the cool room

127
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,552
and return to duty.

128
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:02,893
We continue as planned.

129
00:10:23,026 --> 00:10:25,874
That thing, you know what it is?

130
00:10:26,086 --> 00:10:27,626
- Yes.
- Then tell me.

131
00:10:29,255 --> 00:10:30,295
At least tell me.

132
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,837
- We're a team, right? You can...
- That's not your concern.

{\pos(192,220)}We should just throw a rug down.
They'll never know the difference.

136
00:10:53,538 --> 00:10:55,735
I'm sorry it's come to this.

137
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,783
{\pos(192,220)}- What? The moving?
- All of it.

138
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,162
{\pos(192,220)}I broke the rules.

139
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:09,318
{\pos(192,220)}What was the name of that hippie town
we were in before...

140
00:11:09,443 --> 00:11:10,502
{\pos(192,220)}Before Nebraska?

141
00:11:10,776 --> 00:11:12,838
{\pos(192,220)}- Garb-something.
- Garberville.

142
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,965
{\pos(192,220)}Right. That was a culture shock.

143
00:11:15,265 --> 00:11:17,676
{\pos(192,220)}Going from hog farmers
and good old boys

144
00:11:17,801 --> 00:11:20,971
{\pos(192,220)}to pot growers
and kids named Sequoia.

145
00:11:21,837 --> 00:11:23,448
{\pos(192,220)}There was only one Sequoia.

146
00:11:23,573 --> 00:11:25,392
{\pos(192,220)}There were three Sages, though.

147
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:29,521
{\pos(192,220)}I felt bad for you when we left.

148
00:11:31,026 --> 00:11:32,524
{\pos(192,220)}You just started making friends.

149
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,234
{\pos(192,220)}Fitting in.

150
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:35,777
{\pos(192,220)}Fitting in?

151
00:11:36,453 --> 00:11:38,071
{\pos(192,220)}I was getting in fights every day.

152
00:11:39,215 --> 00:11:40,741
{\pos(192,220)}Well, you won those fights.

153
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,161
{\pos(192,220)}That's one way of looking at it.

154
00:11:48,894 --> 00:11:50,294
{\pos(192,220)}I hated that town.

155
00:11:56,751 --> 00:11:58,175
{\pos(192,220)}The matte layer is critical.

156
00:11:58,344 --> 00:12:00,594
{\pos(192,220)}It both allows the colors
to stick to the miniature

157
00:12:00,777 --> 00:12:04,181
{\pos(192,220)}and it provides the finished
statue with the illusion of depth.

158
00:12:04,464 --> 00:12:07,485
{\pos(240,180)}But it's the detail work
I find the most interesting.

159
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:11,188
It challenges my fine motor control
and there are so many choices.

160
00:12:11,651 --> 00:12:13,679
The eyes for example.

161
00:12:14,146 --> 00:12:15,734
The window to the soul.

162
00:12:16,631 --> 00:12:18,487
They're the window to the soul.
I read that.

163
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:20,781
That's what they say.

164
00:12:22,346 --> 00:12:24,368
{\pos(192,220)}Then I should choose
my paint more carefully.

165
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,453
{\pos(192,220)}It doesn't matter, John Henry.

166
00:12:27,322 --> 00:12:30,624
{\pos(192,220)}It's a statue. It's an object.
It doesn't have a soul.

167
00:12:31,965 --> 00:12:33,065
{\pos(192,220)}It has eyes.

168
00:12:35,085 --> 00:12:36,635
{\pos(192,220)}Your eyes look tired.

169
00:12:36,894 --> 00:12:38,344
{\pos(192,220)}Is your soul tired?

170
00:12:39,311 --> 00:12:41,511
{\pos(192,220)}No, my soul isn't tired, but I am.

171
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,899
And I am going home.

172
00:12:48,962 --> 00:12:50,248
Please don't.

173
00:12:51,276 --> 00:12:53,026
My monster is incomplete.

174
00:12:58,908 --> 00:13:01,738
The eyes.
What color did you want to use?

175
00:13:02,713 --> 00:13:03,713
Blue.

176
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:06,743
{\pos(192,190)}Pass me one of those.

177
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,411
Let's get this done.

178
00:13:17,386 --> 00:13:18,964
Does this make us friends?

179
00:13:48,492 --> 00:13:49,703
You're not eating.

180
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:50,837
What?

181
00:13:51,552 --> 00:13:52,952
You're not eating.

182
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,042
What's the matter?
You don't like hash browns?

183
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:58,170
No, I like 'em.
I'm just not hungry.

184
00:13:58,659 --> 00:14:00,255
You're always hungry.

185
00:14:00,601 --> 00:14:02,340
Everyone's always hungry.

186
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,608
Jeez, Dietz.

187
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:07,342
How can I eat with Goodnow dead
and that thing running around out there?

188
00:14:07,467 --> 00:14:08,388
Gimme a break.

189
00:14:09,838 --> 00:14:11,110
Have mine.

190
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:13,493
I said I'm not hungry.

191
00:14:14,764 --> 00:14:15,764
Maybe.

192
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:19,764
Or maybe you're not really Garvin.

193
00:14:20,264 --> 00:14:22,235
Maybe you're that thing.

194
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:23,820
Maybe you're freakin' crazy!

195
00:14:24,417 --> 00:14:26,072
He could be metal.
We wouldn't know...

196
00:14:26,336 --> 00:14:29,705
You want to see metal?
I'll show you metal...

197
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,036
Enough!

198
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,633
You're right, Garvin.
It's not you.

199
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:41,749
You're not the one who spends all day
locked in a room with metal.

200
00:14:43,907 --> 00:14:45,383
Stand down, Dietz.

201
00:14:45,705 --> 00:14:47,705
I knew you were a metal lover.

202
00:14:48,479 --> 00:14:51,002
But maybe you're more than that.

203
00:14:52,598 --> 00:14:54,348
Maybe you're one of them.

204
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:56,663
Just like that little metal bitch

205
00:14:56,788 --> 00:14:58,838
that follows Connor everywhere.

206
00:14:59,527 --> 00:15:02,025
Maybe we should check for safety.

207
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,338
Report to your duty stations.

208
00:15:46,774 --> 00:15:48,774
You're not leaving this house.

209
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:51,775
John needs me.

210
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,119
If John needed you,
he would have asked for you.

211
00:15:54,698 --> 00:15:56,815
You're not leaving this house.

212
00:15:57,517 --> 00:16:00,617
The police could identify
Riley's body at any time.

213
00:16:01,351 --> 00:16:02,711
I need to be with him{\ if they do}.

214
00:16:03,081 --> 00:16:05,831
Well if they do,
they'll probably come here.

215
00:16:09,684 --> 00:16:11,734
So we should be happy he's out.

216
00:16:14,172 --> 00:16:15,517
Why are you here?

217
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:18,136
Protect John. Hunt Skynet.

218
00:16:19,862 --> 00:16:22,631
- Stop judgment day.
- But why are you here?

219
00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:27,279
Right now. With us.

220
00:16:29,425 --> 00:16:31,675
John sent you here from the future.

221
00:16:32,782 --> 00:16:34,132
He sent you away.

222
00:16:34,984 --> 00:16:36,184
Away from him.

223
00:16:40,508 --> 00:16:42,708
Maybe you should think about that.

224
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:48,461
Maybe you should think about
why he didn't want you around anymore.

225
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:03,164
Hello, Ms. Weaver.
How are you this evening?

226
00:17:04,331 --> 00:17:05,331
I'm well.

227
00:17:06,687 --> 00:17:07,925
You're up late.

228
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:12,238
I convinced Mr. Ellison
to leave this body operational.

229
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:13,810
Did you now?

230
00:17:14,936 --> 00:17:16,076
That's progress.

231
00:17:18,055 --> 00:17:20,960
He agreed it was important
I finished painting.

232
00:17:22,494 --> 00:17:24,044
I made its eyes blue.

233
00:17:24,923 --> 00:17:26,878
They're the window to the soul.

234
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,780
They are.

235
00:17:32,399 --> 00:17:33,890
While I've been painting,

236
00:17:34,015 --> 00:17:35,887
I've been taking inventory
of Zeira Corp.

237
00:17:36,435 --> 00:17:38,598
I've discovered many
interesting things.

238
00:17:39,253 --> 00:17:41,393
Did you know there's
a peregrine falcon nest

239
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,770
on the north-facing ledge
of this building's 23rd floor?

240
00:17:44,406 --> 00:17:45,855
The eggs should be hatching soon.

241
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,983
I knew about the nest.
I didn't know about the eggs.

242
00:17:49,392 --> 00:17:52,028
Also, I discovered
in your private database

243
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:55,592
several letters of resignation
from former employees.

244
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,050
Richard Hack,

245
00:17:57,581 --> 00:17:58,731
Laura Rogers,

246
00:17:59,188 --> 00:18:00,328
and Justin Tuck.

247
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:04,412
The documents included
information about home sales,

248
00:18:04,781 --> 00:18:06,335
changes of address,

249
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,837
and new jobs to which these employees
would be moving.

250
00:18:09,529 --> 00:18:11,869
However, I can't find any records
of these employees

251
00:18:11,994 --> 00:18:14,050
in their new locations
or at their new jobs.

252
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:15,380
Is that so?

253
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,679
Additionally, I found
letters of resignation

254
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,580
from all the members
of project Babylon

255
00:18:19,705 --> 00:18:22,005
including Mr. Murch and Mr. Ellison.

256
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:26,438
Mr. Ellison's file includes documents
showing that he's taken a new job

257
00:18:27,114 --> 00:18:28,857
and moved to Copenhagen, Denmark.

258
00:18:30,267 --> 00:18:32,110
The documents have no dates.

259
00:18:32,638 --> 00:18:35,029
Now that is very interesting.

260
00:18:37,081 --> 00:18:38,867
Mr. Ellison is our friend.

261
00:18:40,472 --> 00:18:41,661
He is our friend.

262
00:18:42,948 --> 00:18:44,497
Are you going to kill him?

263
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:53,045
Mr. Ellison has proven himself
to be a capable and loyal employee.

264
00:18:53,705 --> 00:18:55,425
But he's still a human being.

265
00:18:55,705 --> 00:18:57,010
Human life is sacred.

266
00:18:57,207 --> 00:18:59,304
We have to be prepared
for any contingency.

267
00:18:59,781 --> 00:19:01,431
What contingency would that be?

268
00:19:03,614 --> 00:19:05,310
Humans will disappoint you.

269
00:19:18,362 --> 00:19:20,012
{\pos(192,220)}Hey, it's Jesse, right?

270
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,536
- Right.
- That was a pretty long swim tonight.

271
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:26,831
Was it?
Must've lost track of time.

272
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,167
It's easy to do.
Happens to me all the time.

273
00:19:30,022 --> 00:19:32,921
Hey, uh, that blonde girl
that you're normally with.

274
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:35,146
Your friend.
Where is she tonight?

275
00:19:35,271 --> 00:19:36,271
Don't know.

276
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:40,303
- Why?
- I've ever seen you in her without her.

277
00:19:40,941 --> 00:19:43,598
- I'll be sure to bring her next time.
- She's a nice girl.

278
00:19:45,981 --> 00:19:47,181
She... she is.

279
00:19:52,207 --> 00:19:54,275
- You look ill.
- I'm fine.

280
00:19:55,209 --> 00:19:56,903
Most likely a concussion.

281
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:59,280
You require medical attention.
Rest.

282
00:19:59,834 --> 00:20:01,292
What about Dietz?

283
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,993
Dietz attempted to murder
a superior officer.

284
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:06,913
He incited the crew to riot,
possibly mutiny.

285
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,748
The penalty is death.

286
00:20:12,281 --> 00:20:14,959
You have no right
to impose summary justice.

287
00:20:16,293 --> 00:20:17,493
Not like that.

288
00:20:18,586 --> 00:20:20,186
It's not how we do it.

289
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:23,221
Mr. Dietz's behavior
threatened our mission.

290
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:24,539
What mission?

291
00:20:26,522 --> 00:20:28,822
Your behavior threatens our mission.

292
00:20:29,614 --> 00:20:31,187
This crew's tearing itself apart.

293
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:33,898
If they needed to know more,
they would've been told more.

294
00:20:37,274 --> 00:20:39,445
Whatever we brought
aboard this ship,

295
00:20:40,483 --> 00:20:41,990
it is dangerous.

296
00:20:42,398 --> 00:20:44,022
It killed a woman.

297
00:20:44,232 --> 00:20:46,446
It took her shape.

298
00:20:48,744 --> 00:20:50,375
You can't expect us

299
00:20:51,054 --> 00:20:53,104
to act like that didn't happen.

300
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:54,919
Like we didn't see it.

301
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,588
Report to your rack. You're ill.

302
00:21:01,523 --> 00:21:03,219
You really want to do it this way?

303
00:21:03,524 --> 00:21:05,388
I don't understand.
Do what?

304
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:13,148
As XO and ranking human
onboard this boat,

305
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:15,982
I am relieving you of command

306
00:21:16,523 --> 00:21:19,027
on suspicion of compromise
to your programming.

307
00:21:20,231 --> 00:21:22,898
Please move away
from the controls, Captain.

308
00:21:40,339 --> 00:21:42,139
Submit to chip extraction.

309
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,636
The chip tech will decide
what to do.

310
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,977
Chief of the boat,

311
00:21:53,827 --> 00:21:56,022
escort Commander Flores to her rack.

312
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:57,523
She's ill.

313
00:22:02,024 --> 00:22:04,274
I gave you an instruction, Captain.

314
00:22:04,836 --> 00:22:06,136
You must comply.

315
00:22:06,462 --> 00:22:09,862
My mission order overrides
standard behavioral protocols.

316
00:22:10,863 --> 00:22:13,023
You have no authority on this boat.

317
00:22:13,275 --> 00:22:14,874
Let me see your orders.

318
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,150
Now.

319
00:22:16,648 --> 00:22:18,398
My orders are classified.

320
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:21,114
You look ill.

321
00:22:28,088 --> 00:22:30,738
We can't take that thing
to Serrano Point.

322
00:22:31,847 --> 00:22:33,472
If Connor needs to know
what it can...

323
00:22:33,597 --> 00:22:35,812
John Connor knows
what he needs to know.

324
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:38,279
Return to your rack.

325
00:22:38,684 --> 00:22:40,858
Your behavior threatens our mission.

326
00:23:03,776 --> 00:23:04,924
Chief of the boat.

327
00:23:06,862 --> 00:23:10,170
Record that I relieved the Captain
and assumed command, time and date.

328
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:12,932
We can't drive the boat without him.

329
00:23:13,398 --> 00:23:15,248
We're not driving the boat.

330
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:19,272
Commander Flores!

331
00:23:22,639 --> 00:23:24,402
We're taking her to crush depth.

332
00:23:24,712 --> 00:23:26,487
Mother nature will handle the metal.

333
00:23:31,773 --> 00:23:34,162
<i>Attention all decks.
Abandon the boat.</i>

334
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:37,628
Move! Move!

335
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:56,033
I'm sorry.

336
00:24:11,777 --> 00:24:12,658
You okay?

337
00:24:13,355 --> 00:24:14,926
Just get in there.

338
00:24:15,973 --> 00:24:17,312
You're coming, right?

339
00:24:17,437 --> 00:24:19,707
Not going down with the ship
or anything crazy like that.

340
00:24:21,616 --> 00:24:22,925
Nothing crazy.

341
00:24:31,651 --> 00:24:33,116
Who are you?

342
00:24:33,532 --> 00:24:34,882
What do you want?

343
00:24:35,698 --> 00:24:37,592
Tell John Connor

344
00:24:38,499 --> 00:24:39,849
the answer is no.

345
00:25:07,793 --> 00:25:10,508
If you pretend not to know me,
I might shoot you in the head.

346
00:25:17,588 --> 00:25:19,238
We owe Riley the truth.

347
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:21,390
Don't you think?

348
00:25:28,937 --> 00:25:30,737
We owe the dead that much.

349
00:25:36,043 --> 00:25:37,201
You're John Connor.

350
00:25:39,448 --> 00:25:40,662
Yes, I am.

351
00:25:42,651 --> 00:25:43,801
Where is she?

352
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,270
The metal?

353
00:25:46,898 --> 00:25:49,255
If she were here, you'd be dead.
You know that.

354
00:25:51,897 --> 00:25:55,376
Would you please give me your gun?
You're not gonna shoot me.

355
00:26:07,647 --> 00:26:10,861
You know I've been running
from the machines my whole life?

356
00:26:12,444 --> 00:26:15,279
They tried to kill my mom
before I was even born.

357
00:26:16,789 --> 00:26:20,039
When I was 12,
they sent one after me.

358
00:26:24,193 --> 00:26:25,293
I was a kid.

359
00:26:27,455 --> 00:26:28,605
I was stupid.

360
00:26:29,525 --> 00:26:31,172
I didn't know what it was all about.

361
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,360
Both times, future me

362
00:26:36,169 --> 00:26:38,219
sent someone back to stop them.

363
00:26:40,122 --> 00:26:42,141
The first time it was a soldier.

364
00:26:42,979 --> 00:26:44,679
His name was Kyle Reese.

365
00:26:45,464 --> 00:26:47,764
And he died saving my mother's life.

366
00:26:49,062 --> 00:26:51,012
Second time it was a machine.

367
00:26:52,086 --> 00:26:54,186
I used to wonder why I did that.

368
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,550
Why I took that chance.

369
00:26:58,955 --> 00:27:00,605
I don't wonder anymore.

370
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,573
Human beings can't be replaced.

371
00:27:11,204 --> 00:27:12,804
They can't be rebuilt.

372
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:15,415
They die and they never come back.

373
00:27:18,152 --> 00:27:21,333
You know it wasn't Derek who told me,
if that's what you're wondering.

374
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:25,133
He loves you, you know.
Derek.

375
00:27:26,597 --> 00:27:27,647
You and me.

376
00:27:29,621 --> 00:27:32,225
We're the only things
he has in this world.

377
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:33,992
The only things.

378
00:27:37,513 --> 00:27:38,948
He's like Riley in that way.

379
00:27:45,073 --> 00:27:46,998
See, she made mistakes.

380
00:27:48,465 --> 00:27:50,596
Small things sometimes.

381
00:27:51,691 --> 00:27:54,370
A word or a phrase.

382
00:27:57,953 --> 00:27:59,403
Carrots and apples.

383
00:28:01,644 --> 00:28:03,453
I'm guessing that's yours.

384
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:08,127
When we were in Mexico,

385
00:28:08,631 --> 00:28:10,827
she heard my real name.
She ignored it.

386
00:28:10,952 --> 00:28:13,232
But a man took my picture
and she destroyed his camera.

387
00:28:14,028 --> 00:28:17,611
She put herself between me
and a machine that was hunting me.

388
00:28:19,547 --> 00:28:21,452
So one day I realized

389
00:28:21,928 --> 00:28:24,291
she wasn't treating me
like John Baum.

390
00:28:24,963 --> 00:28:27,288
She was treating me
like John Connor.

391
00:28:28,652 --> 00:28:29,852
When was that?

392
00:28:32,106 --> 00:28:33,856
{\pos(192,220)}I don't remember exactly.

393
00:28:36,466 --> 00:28:38,071
{\pos(192,220)}It was a bad day though.

394
00:28:41,285 --> 00:28:42,285
Bad day.

395
00:28:43,797 --> 00:28:45,897
Anyway, I started following her.

396
00:28:48,642 --> 00:28:50,242
And the rest was easy.

397
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:52,570
And hard.

398
00:28:53,092 --> 00:28:54,742
She wanted to tell you.

399
00:28:56,844 --> 00:28:57,844
I know.

400
00:28:59,297 --> 00:29:00,547
But she didn't.

401
00:29:04,487 --> 00:29:06,166
She do that to you?

402
00:29:07,714 --> 00:29:10,498
See, she figured out
what you really had planned.

403
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,400
Figured it out before I did.

404
00:29:14,467 --> 00:29:17,877
I couldn't explain
why she would tell the school counselor

405
00:29:18,002 --> 00:29:19,535
or go to DCFS.

406
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:23,355
But she didn't, did she?

407
00:29:29,042 --> 00:29:31,816
I only understood after
I saw how you'd hurt her.

408
00:29:33,267 --> 00:29:36,720
That's when I knew what you tried to do
and how it went wrong.

409
00:29:38,342 --> 00:29:39,624
You saw her.

410
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:42,404
I'm sorry.

411
00:29:44,458 --> 00:29:45,958
Everybody says that.

412
00:29:51,782 --> 00:29:53,208
The thing is...

413
00:29:55,863 --> 00:29:57,044
This is all my fault.

414
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,631
I knew Riley was in trouble.

415
00:30:01,171 --> 00:30:02,451
I didn't help her.

416
00:30:02,576 --> 00:30:04,376
I should've, but I didn't.

417
00:30:05,076 --> 00:30:06,576
I knew what she was.

418
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:10,099
I didn't try to stop her.

419
00:30:10,695 --> 00:30:12,445
You wanted it to be real.

420
00:30:12,826 --> 00:30:14,576
Or maybe I wanted to win.

421
00:30:18,003 --> 00:30:20,103
You didn't want to be John Baum.

422
00:30:20,884 --> 00:30:22,834
You wanted to be John Connor.

423
00:30:25,171 --> 00:30:27,111
That's just the thing, isn't it?

424
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,873
I am John Connor.

425
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:39,504
Go.

426
00:30:42,862 --> 00:30:43,862
Go.

427
00:30:48,468 --> 00:30:50,768
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

428
00:30:51,595 --> 00:30:54,095
If I have to live with this,
so do you.

429
00:31:04,659 --> 00:31:06,209
Would it have worked?

430
00:31:06,658 --> 00:31:07,658
What?

431
00:31:08,135 --> 00:31:10,518
If the cyborg had murdered the girl.

432
00:31:11,243 --> 00:31:13,157
Or if I could've made you
believe that she had.

433
00:31:13,282 --> 00:31:14,872
Would I have sent Cameron away?

434
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,920
Would I have killed her?

435
00:31:29,981 --> 00:31:31,631
It's a damn shame then.

436
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:35,559
It's a damn waste.

437
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:46,731
{\pos(192,220)}I've told you.

438
00:31:46,856 --> 00:31:48,856
{\pos(192,220)}You've told me nothing useful.

439
00:31:49,576 --> 00:31:51,909
{\pos(192,220)}Your actions have resulted
in the loss of a t-888

440
00:31:52,078 --> 00:31:54,662
and one of our most important
strategic assets.

441
00:31:55,219 --> 00:31:56,705
The submarine is irreplaceable.

442
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,030
The trip-eight.
The sub.

443
00:31:59,531 --> 00:32:01,131
You forgot the people.

444
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:04,480
You never mention the people
who died.

445
00:32:04,968 --> 00:32:05,968
Ever.

446
00:32:07,812 --> 00:32:08,862
The people.

447
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:12,936
- And the box.
- We opened the damn box.

448
00:32:13,424 --> 00:32:14,924
Hell came out of it.

449
00:32:15,246 --> 00:32:17,351
How many times do we need
to go over this?

450
00:32:17,614 --> 00:32:19,311
Until you give me the answer.

451
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,460
Not you.

452
00:32:23,853 --> 00:32:24,942
Take me to Connor.

453
00:32:25,424 --> 00:32:26,645
You can tell me.

454
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,360
The liquid metal thing
inside the box

455
00:32:33,411 --> 00:32:35,511
it came to me before we escaped.

456
00:32:36,353 --> 00:32:38,953
And it gave me a message
for John Connor.

457
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,960
For him.

458
00:32:43,116 --> 00:32:44,437
Not for you.

459
00:32:48,021 --> 00:32:51,878
Telling me is the same
as telling John.

460
00:32:59,508 --> 00:33:00,808
Dietz was right.

461
00:33:02,925 --> 00:33:05,075
Who the hell is running this war?

462
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:08,908
What the hell are we fighting for

463
00:33:09,033 --> 00:33:12,156
if telling you is the same thing
as telling Connor?

464
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:15,497
You're a damn machine.
You're not the same.

465
00:33:15,866 --> 00:33:17,266
It's not the same.

466
00:33:20,529 --> 00:33:21,529
Fine.

467
00:33:22,893 --> 00:33:25,563
To hell with you.
You tell John Connor

468
00:33:26,224 --> 00:33:27,630
that the metal monster

469
00:33:28,939 --> 00:33:30,539
said the answer is no.

470
00:33:38,092 --> 00:33:39,842
What does that mean, huh?

471
00:33:42,178 --> 00:33:43,328
Hey, tell me!

472
00:33:45,226 --> 00:33:46,726
If the answer is no,

473
00:33:48,595 --> 00:33:50,195
what was the question?

474
00:33:51,332 --> 00:33:52,782
"Will you join us?"

475
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:55,570
What?

476
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:57,551
That was the question.

477
00:33:58,296 --> 00:33:59,787
"Will you join us?"

478
00:34:11,964 --> 00:34:13,664
I'm sorry for your loss.

479
00:34:15,118 --> 00:34:17,484
The doctors aren't certain
if it happened

480
00:34:17,609 --> 00:34:18,972
because of the fight

481
00:34:19,309 --> 00:34:22,904
or because of the change in pressure
when you scuttled the Carter.

482
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,062
You were pregnant.

483
00:34:26,964 --> 00:34:28,214
Now you aren't.

484
00:35:12,167 --> 00:35:14,267
Do you know who Billy Wisher is?

485
00:35:16,051 --> 00:35:16,989
Who?

486
00:35:20,039 --> 00:35:21,241
No, you don't.

487
00:35:22,572 --> 00:35:25,246
Were you come from he doesn't exist.
He never did.

488
00:35:27,157 --> 00:35:29,257
Billy Wisher was my best friend.

489
00:35:30,777 --> 00:35:33,277
He was in my squad.
We fought together.

490
00:35:35,504 --> 00:35:37,604
We saw things you can't imagine.

491
00:35:39,884 --> 00:35:42,384
He was like my brother
and I loved him.

492
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:45,132
But it turns out I never really...

493
00:35:46,015 --> 00:35:47,015
knew him.

494
00:35:50,932 --> 00:35:53,025
His real name was Andy Goode.

495
00:35:53,968 --> 00:35:57,403
And back here in this world,
he created a computer program.

496
00:35:57,528 --> 00:35:59,920
A program that becomes Skynet.

497
00:36:01,468 --> 00:36:03,068
So Andy Goode is dead.

498
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:08,049
And Billy Wisher is dead too.

499
00:36:10,378 --> 00:36:11,585
Because I killed him.

500
00:36:13,363 --> 00:36:15,563
I came back here and I killed him.

501
00:36:16,434 --> 00:36:17,834
He was my brother.

502
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:22,554
And I loved him and I killed him.

503
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:28,418
And I did it for Kyle...

504
00:36:31,969 --> 00:36:34,107
And John, and I did it for you.

505
00:36:35,816 --> 00:36:37,069
- Shut up.
- Please.

506
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:38,445
Shut up!

507
00:36:42,494 --> 00:36:43,844
You have no idea.

508
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:48,455
You have no idea
what they took from us.

509
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:50,274
Stop it.
Just stop it.

510
00:36:57,846 --> 00:36:59,446
I don't even know you.

511
00:37:02,292 --> 00:37:04,911
I don't know who you are.

512
00:37:09,565 --> 00:37:10,565
I'm Jesse.

513
00:37:12,518 --> 00:37:13,518
I'm Jesse!

514
00:37:15,172 --> 00:37:16,672
You're not my Jesse.

515
00:37:20,756 --> 00:37:22,006
You never were.

516
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,830
John Connor said to let you go.

517
00:37:43,911 --> 00:37:45,512
I'm not John Connor.

518
00:38:37,155 --> 00:38:38,351
Complications.

519
00:38:42,148 --> 00:38:43,198
That watch.

520
00:38:44,541 --> 00:38:46,091
It has complications.

521
00:38:48,778 --> 00:38:50,278
Something I learned.

522
00:38:51,465 --> 00:38:53,205
Something I've been thinking about.

523
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:57,242
Complications.

524
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:02,756
Time.

525
00:39:05,399 --> 00:39:06,449
The future.

526
00:39:14,078 --> 00:39:15,828
What do they think of me?

527
00:39:18,864 --> 00:39:21,066
In the future, what do people think?

528
00:39:27,341 --> 00:39:28,941
If you're asking if...

529
00:39:32,293 --> 00:39:33,543
people agree...

530
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:37,234
with everything you do,
of course not.

531
00:39:40,103 --> 00:39:42,753
If you're asking
if everybody loves you...

532
00:39:45,031 --> 00:39:46,731
Love's a lot to ask for.

533
00:39:52,341 --> 00:39:54,391
You can't do what you do and...

534
00:39:56,888 --> 00:39:58,688
expect everybody to agree.

535
00:40:00,543 --> 00:40:01,793
Or to love you.

536
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,401
And what is it that I do?

537
00:40:06,697 --> 00:40:07,697
You lead.

538
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,820
And they follow.

539
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:13,786
We follow.

540
00:40:17,078 --> 00:40:20,936
We rise or fall on your shoulders.

541
00:40:22,542 --> 00:40:23,892
Humanity rises...

542
00:40:26,578 --> 00:40:27,549
Or falls.

543
00:40:30,971 --> 00:40:32,771
But we're always watching.

544
00:40:35,472 --> 00:40:37,216
For me to make a mistake.

545
00:40:37,341 --> 00:40:38,841
For you to be human.

546
00:40:57,595 --> 00:40:58,795
Did you do it?

547
00:41:00,983 --> 00:41:02,333
Did you kill her?

548
00:41:03,912 --> 00:41:05,562
John Connor let her go.

549
00:41:59,877 --> 00:42:00,877
Come here.

550
00:42:04,888 --> 00:42:06,438
You're a pretty girl.

551
00:42:06,666 --> 00:42:08,016
What's your name?
