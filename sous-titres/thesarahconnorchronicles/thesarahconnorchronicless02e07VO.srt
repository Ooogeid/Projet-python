00:00:00,371 --> 00:00:02,864
<i>Previously on</i> Terminator:
The Sarah Connor Chronicles...

2
00:00:02,984 --> 00:00:05,717
- You have been drinking?
- So what are you in for?

3
00:00:06,396 --> 00:00:07,406
I'm Jody.

4
00:00:07,696 --> 00:00:10,639
- What did you do... Did you hurt me?
- Is there a problem?

5
00:00:11,561 --> 00:00:13,767
No, I'm her brother, John Baum.

6
00:00:14,052 --> 00:00:17,395
Anything you say is confidential.
Except if you were planning

7
00:00:17,555 --> 00:00:19,689
to harm someone,
I would have to report that.

8
00:00:22,435 --> 00:00:24,444
- Jesse.
- Hi, baby.

9
00:00:25,313 --> 00:00:27,405
Are you AWOL?
Jesse, did you run?

10
00:00:27,723 --> 00:00:29,282
I need a place to rest.

11
00:01:16,466 --> 00:01:17,466
Why?

12
00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:20,014
Aren't you on the same side?

13
00:01:20,134 --> 00:01:22,001
Skynet does not believe in you
like I do.

14
00:01:22,161 --> 00:01:24,838
Believe?
What do you believe?

15
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,635
You will lead me to the Connors.

16
00:01:46,992 --> 00:01:48,100
Stay there.

17
00:02:25,302 --> 00:02:26,608
There's no one here.

18
00:02:49,822 --> 00:02:51,090
Where the hell are you?

19
00:02:53,698 --> 00:02:55,595
Where the hell am I supposed to be?

20
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,120
- We just got robbed.
- <i>You were what?</i>

21
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,183
Diamonds, cash, credit cards, IDs.

22
00:03:00,343 --> 00:03:01,768
They cleaned us out.

23
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:03,728
Machine?

24
00:03:04,635 --> 00:03:06,437
My leather jacket's gone.

25
00:03:06,557 --> 00:03:08,608
- So is most of the food.
- Human.

26
00:03:10,407 --> 00:03:12,946
If those IDs
fall into the wrong hands...

27
00:03:14,886 --> 00:03:16,487
Listen, head downtown.

28
00:03:17,477 --> 00:03:20,483
I'll call you with an exact location
in half an hour.

29
00:03:25,263 --> 00:03:26,461
Who was that?

30
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,432
Real life calling.

31
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,421
You don't always have to answer.

32
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:34,580
I tried it ignoring it all before
and the whole freaking town blew up.

33
00:03:36,855 --> 00:03:38,203
You're a funny man.

34
00:03:38,957 --> 00:03:41,857
That's the first thing people say.
Funny Derek.

35
00:03:56,809 --> 00:04:00,285
What's wrong with the system?
Why didn't it beep like you set it up?

36
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,916
Riley climbed out John's window.

37
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:10,253
Impossible
with the alarm turned on.

38
00:04:11,355 --> 00:04:12,385
Thanks.

39
00:04:13,298 --> 00:04:15,633
- You gave her the code?
- We were up late watching TV.

40
00:04:15,793 --> 00:04:17,510
She was supposed to reset it.

41
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:20,170
And somehow
your master plan went awry.

42
00:04:21,007 --> 00:04:22,557
- Mom...
- John, our IDs

43
00:04:22,717 --> 00:04:24,601
are out there.
Our names, our faces.

44
00:04:24,915 --> 00:04:27,651
Fake addresses, fake names.
Nothing can be traced to this house.

45
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:31,190
No? What if the police find the guy?
Where that trail leads to?

46
00:04:32,707 --> 00:04:35,570
If our IDs made it into the system
linked to this address...

47
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:36,696
Canada.

48
00:04:38,062 --> 00:04:39,449
We should move to Canada.

49
00:04:42,051 --> 00:04:44,956
Saw your door was open.
I thought I'd bring you guys some...

50
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,875
Oh, my God, what happened?

51
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,253
- I'll go call Trevor.
- No.

52
00:04:49,644 --> 00:04:51,713
John's been having trouble
with kids at school.

53
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,468
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

54
00:04:53,588 --> 00:04:55,381
You know how stupid kids can be.

55
00:04:57,337 --> 00:05:00,445
Anyway, you'll know soon enough.
We're on our way to see their parents.

56
00:05:00,565 --> 00:05:02,440
All right,
if you change your mind...

57
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,764
I'll call you.

58
00:05:04,634 --> 00:05:06,639
What am I supposed to do?

59
00:05:08,193 --> 00:05:09,895
I'd start with a broom.

60
00:05:20,455 --> 00:05:21,741
Come on, Rita.

61
00:05:21,901 --> 00:05:25,036
I got the county breathing down my neck.
We can't have a backlog like this.

62
00:05:25,929 --> 00:05:27,205
I'll get it done.

63
00:05:28,936 --> 00:05:31,125
- Today.
- I needed it two weeks ago.

64
00:05:52,891 --> 00:05:55,079
It's my son.
He took off this morning

65
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,154
with the neighbor's car
and my credit cards.

66
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,810
<i>We'll call you right away
if he attempts a charge, Miss Baum.</i>

67
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,931
- <i>Is this a good number to reach you?</i>
- Yes, thank you.

68
00:06:05,278 --> 00:06:07,370
If you knew,
why didn't you say something?

69
00:06:08,277 --> 00:06:10,415
- To you?
- To me, to him, to somebody.

70
00:06:10,575 --> 00:06:13,292
I've always made my position on security
very clear.

71
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:17,171
No one likes a nag.

72
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,784
I'm looking for this girl.

73
00:06:38,854 --> 00:06:41,487
You see these people, Sir?
These people are real.

74
00:06:41,647 --> 00:06:45,116
These are the real people,
and they were all here before you.

75
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:47,301
I'm her uncle.

76
00:06:48,981 --> 00:06:50,413
And I'm Angelina Jolie.

77
00:06:50,917 --> 00:06:52,457
Get to the back of the line.

78
00:06:54,931 --> 00:06:56,426
I know that chick.

79
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:04,023
So what do you want her for?

80
00:07:04,143 --> 00:07:06,429
- She owe you money?
- I'm her uncle.

81
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,099
You're not her uncle.
You're a cop.

82
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:11,462
I'm not a cop.

83
00:07:12,785 --> 00:07:13,853
You gonna hurt her?

84
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:19,525
And her brother too?

85
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,849
Her brother?

86
00:07:21,305 --> 00:07:23,404
John Baum or whatever.

87
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,198
John Baum?

88
00:07:25,784 --> 00:07:27,075
Another prize.

89
00:07:30,445 --> 00:07:31,546
Is that him?

90
00:07:35,754 --> 00:07:36,626
That's him.

91
00:07:39,317 --> 00:07:40,718
Let's take a ride.

92
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,180
- Who is it?
- Los Angeles Police Department.

93
00:07:56,264 --> 00:07:57,105
Hold on.

94
00:07:57,475 --> 00:08:00,817
I catch up on last night's game.
You know who won?

95
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:04,028
Steelers, Mr. Ellison.
Could you open the door please?

96
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:17,192
You James Ellison?

97
00:08:19,078 --> 00:08:22,088
I'm placing you under arrest
for the murder of Peter Meyers.

98
00:08:22,531 --> 00:08:23,334
What?

99
00:08:23,454 --> 00:08:25,950
You have the right to remain silent,
and to an attorney.

100
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,490
If you cannot afford one,
one will be appointed to you.

101
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:31,814
Do you understand these rights
as I've read them to you, Sir?

102
00:08:32,121 --> 00:08:34,767
I know my rights.
I don't know what you're talking about.

103
00:08:34,927 --> 00:08:38,326
Please put your hands against the wall.
Now, Mr. Ellison.

104
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,195
Episode 204: Brothers of Nablus
<i>v 1.01</i>

105
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:45,945
http://Projet-SG.net

106
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:53,822
Come on, Moishe, open up.

107
00:08:53,942 --> 00:08:56,150
- <i>Who are they?</i>
- New customers.

108
00:08:57,667 --> 00:08:59,667
Everything we do,
without exception,

109
00:08:59,827 --> 00:09:01,974
can be seen many ways
in the eyes of God,

110
00:09:02,094 --> 00:09:04,547
or nature,
or whatever you want to call it.

111
00:09:04,921 --> 00:09:08,722
Someone came into your home.
Someone took things that were yours.

112
00:09:08,842 --> 00:09:11,471
The Torah says,
"Lo tikom ve'lo titor."

113
00:09:11,706 --> 00:09:12,680
No revenge,

114
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,040
no retribution. On the other hand,

115
00:09:15,426 --> 00:09:18,269
it also says, "Ayan tachat ayn."
An eye for an eye.

116
00:09:18,471 --> 00:09:20,563
And we have the story
of the Brothers of Nablus...

117
00:09:20,723 --> 00:09:22,732
We came here
looking for our diamonds.

118
00:09:23,432 --> 00:09:25,151
Can you help us or not?

119
00:09:26,494 --> 00:09:29,530
I wish I could.
But lately, business

120
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:30,736
is dry as a bone.

121
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:32,992
I called four other fences.

122
00:09:33,233 --> 00:09:35,854
They said you were the busiest man
on the block this week.

123
00:09:37,697 --> 00:09:39,290
Nothing you'd be interested in.

124
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,450
Show us.

125
00:09:48,305 --> 00:09:49,306
These...

126
00:09:50,479 --> 00:09:52,481
I bought in the last two days.

127
00:09:54,123 --> 00:09:56,131
All from legitimate sources.

128
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,001
This one's ours.

129
00:10:08,564 --> 00:10:12,323
Young lady, even if those were
your diamonds, and they're not...

130
00:10:12,563 --> 00:10:15,993
there's no way you could tell that
with the naked eye. We have machines.

131
00:10:16,438 --> 00:10:17,329
So are these.

132
00:10:18,864 --> 00:10:20,456
We don't want any trouble.

133
00:10:21,514 --> 00:10:23,507
Tell us where you got 'em
and we're gone.

134
00:10:23,627 --> 00:10:26,836
You think I can put a face
to every diamond in this stack?

135
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,113
Just a face from the last 24 hours.

136
00:10:30,413 --> 00:10:31,328
Moishe,

137
00:10:33,095 --> 00:10:34,000
please.

138
00:10:35,272 --> 00:10:36,318
All right.

139
00:10:36,688 --> 00:10:39,976
It's so early in the week for trouble.
But it's not for you. It's for Jesse.

140
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:44,355
His name's Ostrowski.
Walter Ostrowski.

141
00:10:46,022 --> 00:10:47,549
Where do we find him?

142
00:10:48,655 --> 00:10:50,506
He works out of Toluca Lake,
or so he says.

143
00:10:50,626 --> 00:10:52,405
I just buy the stones.

144
00:10:52,634 --> 00:10:54,203
And this Ostrowski,

145
00:10:54,575 --> 00:10:57,047
you're sure he's the guy
who sold you these?

146
00:10:57,167 --> 00:10:58,703
I shall not lie.

147
00:10:59,938 --> 00:11:01,914
If you're so into God,
what are you doing here?

148
00:11:03,252 --> 00:11:05,130
Hashem has a plan for us all.

149
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,544
For me, diamonds.

150
00:11:20,335 --> 00:11:22,676
- Who's Jesse?
- He came back with me.

151
00:11:22,937 --> 00:11:24,443
He handled the diamonds.

152
00:11:24,563 --> 00:11:25,938
One of them killed him.

153
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,701
Do you want some gum?

154
00:11:32,936 --> 00:11:33,636
No.

155
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:35,686
You sure?

156
00:11:35,811 --> 00:11:37,152
It's cinnamon.

157
00:11:40,551 --> 00:11:43,539
Would it kill you to try
and make a little conversation?

158
00:11:45,624 --> 00:11:47,687
No, it wouldn't kill me.

159
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,129
Funny.

160
00:11:51,249 --> 00:11:52,406
You're funny.

161
00:11:52,686 --> 00:11:54,175
In your own sort of cop way.

162
00:11:55,188 --> 00:11:56,344
I'm not a cop.

163
00:11:57,131 --> 00:11:59,629
You're not a cop.
You're not an uncle.

164
00:11:59,749 --> 00:12:02,120
You're just some guy
who wants to kick the crap

165
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,017
out of little Miss Bitch
and her brother.

166
00:12:05,034 --> 00:12:06,375
Just some guy.

167
00:12:08,062 --> 00:12:09,062
But why?

168
00:12:11,977 --> 00:12:13,611
She try to kill you too?

169
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:14,853
Yes.

170
00:12:18,186 --> 00:12:21,002
Well, this is gonna be fun.

171
00:12:24,599 --> 00:12:26,440
I can't believe
they stole your food.

172
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,943
Freaking amateurs, man.

173
00:12:28,063 --> 00:12:29,254
I know, right?

174
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:32,804
What do you think they're gonna do
with two-week old maple turkey?

175
00:12:33,203 --> 00:12:35,267
Bet your mom freaked out, huh?

176
00:12:36,876 --> 00:12:37,951
Yeah, on me.

177
00:12:38,504 --> 00:12:39,762
On you?
Why on you?

178
00:12:40,881 --> 00:12:42,351
The alarm code.

179
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:45,120
- Did I forget?
- Yeah, you did.

180
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,250
I didn't actually see it happen.
I wasn't here, but I'm sure this...

181
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:49,747
Yeah, I'm positive.

182
00:12:50,188 --> 00:12:51,565
This is where they busted her.

183
00:12:51,685 --> 00:12:54,635
I heard the cops talking about it
when they brought her in.

184
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,880
You are so buying me
these pink and whites,

185
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,899
and that is all there is to it.

186
00:13:00,436 --> 00:13:02,146
Have you seen this girl?

187
00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:04,870
I'm looking for this girl.

188
00:13:05,739 --> 00:13:08,316
I'm so sorry, John.
I can't believe I did that.

189
00:13:08,436 --> 00:13:11,568
Don't worry about it.
It wouldn't have stopped a break-in.

190
00:13:11,688 --> 00:13:13,977
Might have stopped
the picnic, but...

191
00:13:16,383 --> 00:13:18,267
So I know you want to find them
and everything,

192
00:13:18,387 --> 00:13:20,493
but this is getting a little shady.

193
00:13:20,814 --> 00:13:22,265
Does she hate me now?

194
00:13:22,563 --> 00:13:24,625
Don't sweat it.
It's a long list.

195
00:13:26,354 --> 00:13:29,686
You won't get what you want this way.
You should try being warmer to people.

196
00:13:29,806 --> 00:13:32,005
They might be more open,
you know, to talk to you.

197
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,537
I love this stuff.

198
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,581
That's my bad.

199
00:14:02,488 --> 00:14:03,554
That's the guy.

200
00:14:04,111 --> 00:14:05,598
That's definitely the guy.

201
00:14:07,926 --> 00:14:09,782
What am I doing here, detective?

202
00:14:09,902 --> 00:14:12,504
You've been on my side of the table.
You know how this works.

203
00:14:12,624 --> 00:14:14,929
I ask a question,
you answer it.

204
00:14:15,811 --> 00:14:18,256
- Why am I being questioned?
- You tell me.

205
00:14:18,376 --> 00:14:19,745
Who's Peter Meyers?

206
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,433
- I don't know Peter Meyers.
- You killed him.

207
00:14:23,936 --> 00:14:24,924
Killed him?

208
00:14:26,711 --> 00:14:29,241
- No.
- Yes. I've got a witness.

209
00:14:29,689 --> 00:14:32,458
Saw the murder. Recognized you
from the news a few weeks ago.

210
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:33,796
Recognized me?

211
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,216
- From the news?
- The news?

212
00:14:36,336 --> 00:14:38,916
20 of your guys dead...
You the sole survivor.

213
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:41,448
By now you're drowning in guilt,
I'm guessing.

214
00:14:41,568 --> 00:14:44,112
- Throw yourself an anchor.
- Don't know what you're talking about.

215
00:14:44,976 --> 00:14:47,441
I'm talking about surviving,
Mr. Ellison.

216
00:14:47,561 --> 00:14:51,212
I'm talking about the everyday,
walk around pain of surviving

217
00:14:52,171 --> 00:14:53,690
when others have not.

218
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,360
I wanna talk to my lawyer.

219
00:15:01,836 --> 00:15:02,656
Sure.

220
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,743
I meant to ask you.

221
00:15:08,053 --> 00:15:09,537
Why did you steal his clothes?

222
00:15:11,151 --> 00:15:12,497
- What?
- Meyers' clothes.

223
00:15:12,658 --> 00:15:16,043
- You were naked when you killed him.
- I told you, it wasn't me.

224
00:15:16,394 --> 00:15:17,228
Smart.

225
00:15:18,526 --> 00:15:20,859
Your alibi
isn't exactly ironclad, Jim.

226
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:24,190
Unless, of course, you got
a twin brother I don't know about.

227
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:26,724
You got a twin brother
I don't know about?

228
00:15:44,573 --> 00:15:46,498
Dr. Ostrowski's in
with patients all afternoon.

229
00:15:46,618 --> 00:15:49,378
- Would you like to make an appointment?
- We'll just take a second.

230
00:15:49,498 --> 00:15:50,726
Excuse me!

231
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,333
Walter Ostrowski?

232
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:01,555
I think you have something
that belongs to us.

233
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:04,445
Do I know you?

234
00:16:04,565 --> 00:16:07,720
No, but we have a friend in common,
someone in the diamond district.

235
00:16:09,366 --> 00:16:10,133
Moishe.

236
00:16:14,327 --> 00:16:18,030
Why don't we...
talk in my office.

237
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,012
It's...

238
00:16:19,648 --> 00:16:21,161
just across the hall.

239
00:16:48,894 --> 00:16:50,880
Please, please, don't kill me.

240
00:16:51,089 --> 00:16:52,890
- Where's our stuff?
- What stuff?

241
00:16:53,061 --> 00:16:54,642
Passports, IDs, credit cards.

242
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,970
- Leather jacket.
- Everything you stole from our house.

243
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,437
Your house?
I don't...

244
00:17:01,537 --> 00:17:02,816
Tell Moishe I'll pay him.

245
00:17:03,275 --> 00:17:05,586
I'll give you the money today.
It's upstairs in my office.

246
00:17:05,706 --> 00:17:07,571
- Pay Moishe for what?
- Everything I owe him.

247
00:17:09,876 --> 00:17:10,948
Please.

248
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,299
Just don't kill me.

249
00:17:14,592 --> 00:17:15,421
Let him go.

250
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,254
- Why?
- He's not the guy who robbed us.

251
00:17:19,818 --> 00:17:21,542
And go get Moishe's money.

252
00:17:26,435 --> 00:17:29,760
That's why we're here, running
a collections agency for your fence?

253
00:17:30,611 --> 00:17:32,805
Why we're here is because
our security system didn't work.

254
00:17:33,749 --> 00:17:36,380
Why we're here is because
that boy behaves less like John Connor

255
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,630
and more like John Baum every day.

256
00:17:38,929 --> 00:17:40,529
That boy, my son,

257
00:17:41,285 --> 00:17:43,630
has been through more
than you'll ever know.

258
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,077
Right back at you.

259
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:51,937
My friends.

260
00:17:55,452 --> 00:17:57,079
Is this what you're looking for?

261
00:17:58,332 --> 00:18:00,664
You do something for me,
I do something for you. It's business.

262
00:18:00,784 --> 00:18:01,875
This is business.

263
00:18:02,035 --> 00:18:03,876
Please, I just buy the stones.

264
00:18:04,037 --> 00:18:05,751
Who sold you our diamonds?

265
00:18:06,184 --> 00:18:08,799
Okay, okay,
his name is Tristan Dewitt.

266
00:18:09,834 --> 00:18:11,510
- He lives in Reseda.
- Not good enough.

267
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:12,720
It's true. I swear!

268
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,265
He's a friend of my cousin's, a punk.
That's all I know.

269
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,233
You killed Liko.

270
00:18:27,157 --> 00:18:28,187
Not yet.

271
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:42,440
You're never gonna find them
like this.

272
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,127
Do you even know
how many people live in LA County?

273
00:18:46,183 --> 00:18:47,625
An employee at the grocery store

274
00:18:47,745 --> 00:18:50,382
saw them shopping there
on more than one occasion.

275
00:18:50,645 --> 00:18:53,783
It's highly likely
they live within a one-mile radius.

276
00:19:03,013 --> 00:19:04,678
I'm looking for this girl.

277
00:19:08,544 --> 00:19:09,755
This is stupid.

278
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:12,404
Just take me back
to the halfway house.

279
00:19:13,879 --> 00:19:14,937
Did you hear me?

280
00:19:15,198 --> 00:19:17,513
I am done hanging out
with a creepy stalker.

281
00:19:17,633 --> 00:19:18,943
I don't even know your name.

282
00:19:19,063 --> 00:19:21,568
I just came with you because
I wanted to get back at that bitch.

283
00:19:21,688 --> 00:19:25,334
And I thought you were kind of cute.
But you know what? You're not cute.

284
00:19:25,561 --> 00:19:27,808
You're freakin'
<i>Silence of the Lambs</i>.

285
00:19:28,424 --> 00:19:32,002
This is kidnapping. You know that,
right? I could have you arrested.

286
00:19:33,155 --> 00:19:35,010
What are you doing?
Why are we stopping?

287
00:19:44,277 --> 00:19:45,132
Freak!

288
00:20:11,337 --> 00:20:13,019
You're blocking the sun.

289
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:15,634
Had an interesting morning
with our friend Moishe.

290
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,124
He's dropping your name
in front of people

291
00:20:18,244 --> 00:20:20,535
who don't need
to be hearing your name.

292
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:24,476
- Well, he's your fence.
- He likes you better.

293
00:20:27,312 --> 00:20:28,987
I'll have a talk with him.

294
00:20:29,249 --> 00:20:30,762
Help me out, will you?

295
00:20:43,255 --> 00:20:45,855
How long are you planning
on keeping this up?

296
00:20:46,429 --> 00:20:48,859
- What?
- You know what, all this.

297
00:20:49,586 --> 00:20:51,904
Well, I'm certainly gonna try

298
00:20:52,024 --> 00:20:54,298
to get through today
without you spoiling it for me.

299
00:20:56,979 --> 00:21:00,065
The sun sets at 5:47.
I'm not missing that sucker.

300
00:21:07,786 --> 00:21:09,821
I'm not missing one of those again.

301
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,743
I'm looking for this girl.

302
00:21:23,701 --> 00:21:26,580
Why are you looking for her?
Has she done something?

303
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,081
She's my niece.

304
00:21:31,418 --> 00:21:33,837
You... You look really familiar.

305
00:21:34,905 --> 00:21:35,979
Common face.

306
00:21:38,286 --> 00:21:39,509
Have you seen my niece?

307
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,473
I haven't.
I'm sorry.

308
00:21:44,786 --> 00:21:46,779
The house next door,
it's on the market.

309
00:21:46,899 --> 00:21:49,519
- You're listed as the contact.
- That house has been rented.

310
00:21:49,818 --> 00:21:51,438
Thank you for your time.

311
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,721
You guys really know
how to party.

312
00:22:09,865 --> 00:22:11,458
My mom's not much of a cook.

313
00:22:12,778 --> 00:22:14,361
What about Cameron?

314
00:22:15,758 --> 00:22:17,339
She's not really into food.

315
00:22:20,499 --> 00:22:21,685
You gonna get that?

316
00:22:21,811 --> 00:22:23,887
No, if they need me,
they'll call my cell.

317
00:22:24,369 --> 00:22:26,645
Oh, right, because
you're so important.

318
00:22:28,982 --> 00:22:30,537
Hello, Baum residence.

319
00:22:32,063 --> 00:22:33,573
Yeah, just a sec.
Here's John.

320
00:22:33,693 --> 00:22:34,773
It's your neighbor.

321
00:22:36,161 --> 00:22:37,066
Thanks.

322
00:22:38,103 --> 00:22:40,736
- Yeah, hey, Kacy. What's up?
- <i>Hey, John.</i>

323
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:43,824
I don't mean to bother you, but there
was a guy here looking for your sister.

324
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:45,719
- When?
- <i>Just now.</i>

325
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:47,692
And I did not get
a good vibe from him at all.

326
00:22:47,812 --> 00:22:49,735
Something was just off, you know?

327
00:23:04,868 --> 00:23:06,450
What's the matter, John?

328
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:08,287
What's wrong?

329
00:23:17,468 --> 00:23:19,568
- Out. We gotta get out now.
- Why? Who's there?

330
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:22,631
- No, it's okay, I'll get rid of him.
- No, now.

331
00:23:27,922 --> 00:23:29,590
I'm looking for this girl.

332
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,516
She's my niece.

333
00:23:32,061 --> 00:23:33,874
Sorry, I don't know her.

334
00:23:46,254 --> 00:23:48,225
Wish I could be more help.
Good luck finding her.

335
00:23:48,429 --> 00:23:49,848
How do you like your new house?

336
00:23:52,206 --> 00:23:54,185
It's really nice, I love it.

337
00:23:55,837 --> 00:23:57,606
Excuse me,
what do you think you're doing?

338
00:24:01,081 --> 00:24:03,908
Hello, you can't just come
into people's homes.

339
00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:07,074
Hello, are you listening to me?

340
00:24:09,798 --> 00:24:11,339
What is wrong with you?

341
00:24:21,381 --> 00:24:23,374
You're not in these photographs.

342
00:24:23,494 --> 00:24:25,875
Maybe because
I was the one taking them.

343
00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:29,226
Look, if you don't leave,
I'm calling the police.

344
00:24:36,858 --> 00:24:38,146
Thank you for your time.

345
00:24:56,187 --> 00:24:57,770
We were too supportive.

346
00:24:58,188 --> 00:25:00,356
That was the problem in a nutshell.

347
00:25:00,818 --> 00:25:03,171
Your son says he wants
to be a filmmaker.

348
00:25:03,875 --> 00:25:06,942
You tell him,
"Son, movies are great.

349
00:25:07,062 --> 00:25:10,190
"I love going to see them.
But that's pie in the sky.

350
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,763
"You need a salary job."

351
00:25:15,586 --> 00:25:17,769
Thank you for not going
to the police about this.

352
00:25:17,929 --> 00:25:19,396
We just want our things back.

353
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,713
"Come live at home," I told him.
"Until you can get on your feet."

354
00:25:24,251 --> 00:25:27,631
And every time I bring up the idea
of him getting a salary job,

355
00:25:27,814 --> 00:25:29,817
he's got this project to work on,

356
00:25:29,937 --> 00:25:32,306
or that short film he's producing.

357
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:35,996
He's had his troubles,
but he's a good boy.

358
00:25:36,564 --> 00:25:38,066
He's not a boy, Donna.

359
00:25:38,186 --> 00:25:39,766
He's a 34-year-old man.

360
00:25:39,886 --> 00:25:43,169
He lives with us, working in
a video store, robbing people's homes.

361
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:44,796
Video store?

362
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:47,090
Saturn video on La Brea.

363
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:50,635
And who knows if that's true when every
other word out of his mouth is a lie.

364
00:25:51,185 --> 00:25:53,880
Does your son have any friends
who might know where he is?

365
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,264
Anyone at the video store?

366
00:25:58,339 --> 00:25:59,312
Dave.

367
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:01,810
Dave.

368
00:26:02,036 --> 00:26:03,607
Another boy wonder.

369
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:19,188
This is a very curious
turn of events, Mr. Ellison.

370
00:26:20,082 --> 00:26:21,368
I'm innocent.

371
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:23,418
There's an eyewitness.

372
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,703
It wasn't me.

373
00:26:26,249 --> 00:26:27,952
The witness is quite sure.

374
00:26:29,073 --> 00:26:30,188
As I would be

375
00:26:31,072 --> 00:26:34,182
if I had seen what he'd seen.

376
00:26:37,273 --> 00:26:39,351
Is there something
you want to tell me, James?

377
00:26:40,126 --> 00:26:42,039
Something only I would believe?

378
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:47,317
Not here.

379
00:26:54,753 --> 00:26:56,251
I'll be in touch.

380
00:26:58,752 --> 00:26:59,810
Miss Weaver.

381
00:27:01,748 --> 00:27:04,251
Thank you for believing me.

382
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:08,914
What good is faith
if we don't use it?

383
00:27:16,196 --> 00:27:18,499
- Where are we going?
- Nowhere.

384
00:27:19,848 --> 00:27:20,767
Anywhere.

385
00:27:21,147 --> 00:27:24,187
That guy isn't really Cameron's uncle.
Because then he'd be your uncle.

386
00:27:25,739 --> 00:27:27,004
He's nobody's uncle.

387
00:27:27,124 --> 00:27:29,484
Then why is he after Cameron?
Is she a criminal or something?

388
00:27:29,687 --> 00:27:32,320
No, he is, all right?

389
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,754
Well, what if he comes back?

390
00:27:34,874 --> 00:27:37,193
That's not how...
That's not how he works.

391
00:27:37,444 --> 00:27:39,913
- John, I don't understand.
- Look, that guy is really dangerous.

392
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,954
That's all you need to know.
Really dangerous.

393
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,585
Well, I got rid of him, didn't I?

394
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:46,543
I stared him down, and off he went.

395
00:27:47,748 --> 00:27:49,421
- You got lucky.
- Ease up, squinchie.

396
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,192
"Lucky" is my middle name.

397
00:27:51,312 --> 00:27:52,879
Lucky Riley Dawson.

398
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,885
In that sentence,
"Lucky" was your first name.

399
00:27:56,312 --> 00:27:58,096
Whatever.
Stickler.

400
00:27:58,998 --> 00:28:02,140
Admit it,
I was a brave, spooky ninja.

401
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,476
It was totally badass.

402
00:28:06,097 --> 00:28:07,439
Say it!
Just say it.

403
00:28:08,601 --> 00:28:10,425
It was badass.

404
00:28:15,189 --> 00:28:16,375
I know!

405
00:28:20,253 --> 00:28:23,094
Fool's errands
and the Fathers of Nablus.

406
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,659
- It's been a great day.
- Brothers.

407
00:28:26,779 --> 00:28:28,709
- What?
- Brothers of Nablus.

408
00:28:29,305 --> 00:28:30,503
Genesis. Chapter 34.

409
00:28:30,936 --> 00:28:32,422
You've memorized the Bible?

410
00:28:32,582 --> 00:28:35,592
Jacob's daughter Dinah is raped
by Shechem, Prince of Nablus.

411
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:37,509
He falls in love with her.

412
00:28:38,796 --> 00:28:40,267
Shechem's father comes to Jacob

413
00:28:40,387 --> 00:28:43,266
and strikes a bargain to allow
his son to marry Dinah.

414
00:28:43,876 --> 00:28:46,353
- That's brave of him.
- Jacob says yes,

415
00:28:46,709 --> 00:28:49,522
on the condition that all the men
in Shechem's town be circumcised.

416
00:28:50,573 --> 00:28:52,338
Everybody gets what they want.

417
00:28:52,602 --> 00:28:54,194
Three days later,
while Shechem's men

418
00:28:54,354 --> 00:28:56,404
were still in pain
from the circumcision,

419
00:28:57,482 --> 00:28:59,991
Dinah's brothers rode
into the city and killed them all.

420
00:29:00,854 --> 00:29:02,327
That's your kind of story.

421
00:29:04,374 --> 00:29:05,374
Yes.

422
00:29:06,186 --> 00:29:07,332
My kind of story.

423
00:29:12,061 --> 00:29:13,005
Hello.

424
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:14,508
- <i>Miss Baum?</i>
- Yeah.

425
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:16,966
<i>This is Dan Deffenbaugh
calling to let you know</i>

426
00:29:17,086 --> 00:29:18,998
<i>somebody just attempted
a charge with your card.</i>

427
00:29:19,118 --> 00:29:21,565
- Where?
- <i>At a bowling alley in Van Nuys.</i>

428
00:29:21,685 --> 00:29:22,729
<i>Alien Lanes.</i>

429
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,223
Sorry to keep you waiting.

430
00:29:51,343 --> 00:29:54,629
I just have a few more questions,
then we'll get you out of here.

431
00:29:59,015 --> 00:30:02,262
You say Mr. Ellison was completely nude
when he killed Meyers.

432
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,222
I already told you.

433
00:30:04,391 --> 00:30:07,065
And that he killed him
with his bare hands?

434
00:30:07,434 --> 00:30:09,686
- Didn't use a weapon?
- He strangled him.

435
00:30:10,901 --> 00:30:12,531
Did Meyers fight back?

436
00:30:12,651 --> 00:30:15,233
A little,
but the other guy was too strong.

437
00:30:15,548 --> 00:30:16,359
How so?

438
00:30:17,407 --> 00:30:19,826
Snapped his neck
like it was nothing.

439
00:30:20,827 --> 00:30:21,990
A toothpick.

440
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:25,263
Where was Mr. Ellison
before he killed Mr. Meyers?

441
00:30:25,577 --> 00:30:27,287
- Out on the road.
- The road.

442
00:30:27,727 --> 00:30:29,664
The road, the street, asphalt.

443
00:30:30,015 --> 00:30:33,084
- Anything unusual about the street?
- Who cares about the street?

444
00:30:33,244 --> 00:30:35,086
Are you lying about the street?

445
00:30:41,575 --> 00:30:42,760
It was like...

446
00:30:43,393 --> 00:30:45,621
- It was like a crater.
- A pothole.

447
00:30:48,915 --> 00:30:51,269
It was like a complete dent
in the road.

448
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:57,110
Mr. Ellison just appeared

449
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,568
out of thin air?

450
00:31:00,266 --> 00:31:03,020
- There was a light.
- What kind of a light?

451
00:31:04,004 --> 00:31:05,686
Bluish purple.

452
00:31:07,231 --> 00:31:09,746
It made, like, a cracking sound.
Like lightning.

453
00:31:11,823 --> 00:31:13,121
So Mr. Ellison

454
00:31:13,818 --> 00:31:15,581
emerged from this...

455
00:31:16,352 --> 00:31:17,809
energy bubble.

456
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:21,299
I never said anything
about a bubble.

457
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,468
But there was a bubble, correct?

458
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:29,850
So to be clear,
you saw Mr. Ellison...

459
00:31:31,504 --> 00:31:34,154
materialize
out of this energy bubble,

460
00:31:34,274 --> 00:31:35,837
completely nude,

461
00:31:35,957 --> 00:31:39,867
walk to Peter Meyers, snap his neck,
steal his clothes, and then disappear.

462
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:45,490
- I know what I saw.
- Thank you for your assistance.

463
00:32:07,044 --> 00:32:08,082
Nice.

464
00:32:10,393 --> 00:32:11,599
It's 1863

465
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:14,226
and Abraham Lincoln
is on the train to Gettysburg.

466
00:32:14,346 --> 00:32:17,967
Then the train breaks down.
Some small Pennsylvania town.

467
00:32:18,217 --> 00:32:20,339
So he's got to stay there
overnight.

468
00:32:20,459 --> 00:32:23,448
The only problem...
town's overrun with zombies.

469
00:32:25,314 --> 00:32:28,157
We shoot it on location,
in Gettysburg, 35 millimeter.

470
00:32:28,317 --> 00:32:29,885
Dude, with what money?

471
00:32:30,968 --> 00:32:32,099
What money?

472
00:32:34,272 --> 00:32:36,965
Do you know how much we made
just off these right here?

473
00:32:37,142 --> 00:32:38,441
Put it down.

474
00:32:39,311 --> 00:32:40,962
That bag you're holding, it's mine.

475
00:32:42,907 --> 00:32:45,684
- Not anymore it isn't.
- This place is closed, ladies.

476
00:32:45,804 --> 00:32:48,511
Unless you wanna get arrested,
I suggest you get the hell out.

477
00:32:48,671 --> 00:32:50,346
My jacket, give it to me.

478
00:32:51,233 --> 00:32:52,599
Come and get it.

479
00:32:52,927 --> 00:32:55,018
- Come and give it to me.
- And the bag.

480
00:33:00,407 --> 00:33:02,375
There's a credit card missing.

481
00:33:06,572 --> 00:33:08,906
We used it on the arcades.
We'll pay you back.

482
00:33:16,248 --> 00:33:17,874
Where's the other guy?

483
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,419
What other guy?

484
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:22,086
Stay here.

485
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:41,567
They knew where we live.

486
00:34:12,451 --> 00:34:14,365
You know those guys out there?

487
00:34:14,841 --> 00:34:17,308
Were you with them
when they robbed the house?

488
00:34:20,411 --> 00:34:23,356
You were never there.
You were never here. You never saw me.

489
00:34:25,184 --> 00:34:27,877
You don't know what happened here.
Understand?

490
00:34:28,411 --> 00:34:31,799
If you say anything to anybody
about what happened here,

491
00:34:32,802 --> 00:34:34,301
I'll hunt you down.

492
00:34:35,037 --> 00:34:36,269
I'll kill you.

493
00:34:38,483 --> 00:34:40,780
Now you wait five minutes,
then you run.

494
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:42,953
Understood?

495
00:34:49,732 --> 00:34:51,926
- Clear?
- Yeah, clear.

496
00:35:02,406 --> 00:35:04,701
- You're free to go.
- What?

497
00:35:04,821 --> 00:35:07,942
The witness is a nutjob.
The judge kicked his statement in 5 min.

498
00:35:08,102 --> 00:35:09,858
We'll have you out of here
in an hour.

499
00:35:10,021 --> 00:35:11,904
Sorry you had to go
through all this.

500
00:35:12,655 --> 00:35:13,726
That's it?

501
00:35:16,453 --> 00:35:17,738
You're a smart guy, Jim.

502
00:35:18,311 --> 00:35:21,289
Take "yes" for an answer.
Good luck out there.

503
00:36:17,293 --> 00:36:19,096
You were gonna have a talk with him.

504
00:36:19,666 --> 00:36:21,528
I did. It was short.

505
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,278
What were you gonna say to him?

506
00:36:24,398 --> 00:36:27,042
Well, you know me.
Funny Derek.

507
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:37,119
- How was the sunset?
- Never better.

508
00:37:16,988 --> 00:37:20,157
You never really struck me
as the type to stalk your ex-wife.

509
00:37:22,669 --> 00:37:24,178
I'm sorry. I just...

510
00:37:26,297 --> 00:37:28,040
I had an urge to see the house.

511
00:37:28,607 --> 00:37:30,259
See something familiar.

512
00:37:31,298 --> 00:37:32,323
Weird, I know.

513
00:37:32,443 --> 00:37:34,630
You do realize
you don't live here anymore.

514
00:37:41,598 --> 00:37:43,088
Fancy ride.

515
00:37:43,443 --> 00:37:46,309
No wonder we keep losing people
to civilian life.

516
00:37:47,047 --> 00:37:48,213
Company car.

517
00:37:48,718 --> 00:37:50,290
They lease it for me.

518
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:54,732
I have to tell you,
you don't look so well.

519
00:37:56,734 --> 00:37:57,958
Yeah, I'm not.

520
00:38:01,672 --> 00:38:02,742
I just...

521
00:38:05,296 --> 00:38:06,922
I don't know, I...

522
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:09,049
I miss it.

523
00:38:10,903 --> 00:38:12,393
I miss my old life.

524
00:38:14,785 --> 00:38:18,146
James, this is a really weird time
to start into all that.

525
00:38:18,266 --> 00:38:20,176
No, no, I don't mean that.

526
00:38:20,797 --> 00:38:22,328
Things have changed.

527
00:38:24,047 --> 00:38:25,280
And I just...

528
00:38:26,496 --> 00:38:29,041
- I didn't.
- You're not making sense.

529
00:38:29,779 --> 00:38:31,375
Come on, come inside.

530
00:38:31,495 --> 00:38:34,221
Paul can make coffee.
We'll talk about it.

531
00:38:35,629 --> 00:38:38,185
Thanks, but I didn't come over
for that.

532
00:38:39,347 --> 00:38:40,696
Yes, you did.

533
00:38:43,242 --> 00:38:45,784
This was the wrong thing
for me to do.

534
00:38:46,932 --> 00:38:48,699
I don't live here anymore.

535
00:38:50,229 --> 00:38:52,132
It was the right thing to do.

536
00:38:52,252 --> 00:38:54,029
Just five years too late.

537
00:38:57,259 --> 00:38:59,799
Call me the next time
you wanna see something familiar.

538
00:39:00,925 --> 00:39:02,630
I'll send you a picture.

539
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,033
Who was it?

540
00:39:17,153 --> 00:39:18,671
They won't be back.

541
00:39:21,051 --> 00:39:22,457
Place looks good.

542
00:39:24,388 --> 00:39:27,034
I think we pretty much
got everything back to how it was.

543
00:39:28,942 --> 00:39:29,954
We?

544
00:39:30,367 --> 00:39:32,795
Riley helped.
So how'd you find 'em?

545
00:39:33,301 --> 00:39:36,460
- Was it Derek's fence, or what?
- You can't bring people here anymore.

546
00:39:36,969 --> 00:39:38,838
What?
She had nothing to do with this.

547
00:39:38,998 --> 00:39:40,089
No, you did.

548
00:39:41,357 --> 00:39:42,995
She just made it worse.

549
00:39:43,115 --> 00:39:44,343
She's a security risk.

550
00:39:50,637 --> 00:39:51,648
Really?

551
00:39:52,331 --> 00:39:54,491
She's never tried to kill me.

552
00:39:56,682 --> 00:39:59,056
And you know that
this has nothing to do with Riley.

553
00:39:59,176 --> 00:40:02,236
Or the rules.
Or the security of this house.

554
00:40:03,989 --> 00:40:07,712
You're pissed off cause I found someone
I actually like spending time with

555
00:40:07,832 --> 00:40:09,285
and it's not you.

556
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:13,706
You think I don't want you
to have a normal life?

557
00:40:14,427 --> 00:40:15,583
No, I don't.

558
00:40:16,179 --> 00:40:18,586
We didn't choose this, John.
It chose us.

559
00:40:18,746 --> 00:40:20,799
And there's nothing either of us
can do about it.

560
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:22,730
My job is to protect you.

561
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:24,393
And you can hate me as you want,

562
00:40:24,513 --> 00:40:26,987
but I will keep doing that
as long as I'm here.

563
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:32,683
Then why didn't you protect me
when I was killing Sarkissian?

564
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:39,012
Why didn't you protect me
when I had my hands around his throat?

565
00:40:40,475 --> 00:40:43,778
Why didn't you protect me from that?

566
00:40:58,161 --> 00:40:59,404
It's a moray.

567
00:41:00,058 --> 00:41:01,919
They're nocturnal predators.

568
00:41:03,231 --> 00:41:05,906
- Does it have a name?
- No, it doesn't.

569
00:41:06,426 --> 00:41:07,916
Please, sit.

570
00:41:15,683 --> 00:41:17,433
I read the witness report.

571
00:41:17,747 --> 00:41:18,813
So did I.

572
00:41:19,757 --> 00:41:21,774
He comes across as crazy,
doesn't he?

573
00:41:22,268 --> 00:41:25,277
- Who wouldn't?
- You, if you'd tell me the truth.

574
00:41:27,252 --> 00:41:29,442
There was another one of you,
wasn't there?

575
00:41:29,562 --> 00:41:30,887
A twin?

576
00:41:32,855 --> 00:41:34,194
Where is it now?

577
00:41:35,014 --> 00:41:36,205
I don't know.

578
00:41:36,832 --> 00:41:37,998
Why did it come?

579
00:41:39,688 --> 00:41:41,210
I think I'm being tested.

580
00:41:42,307 --> 00:41:43,307
Like Job?

581
00:41:47,001 --> 00:41:48,069
You know the story?

582
00:41:48,189 --> 00:41:50,458
He suffered worse
than any man before him.

583
00:41:50,813 --> 00:41:52,555
Everything he loved was taken away.

584
00:41:55,433 --> 00:41:57,155
Everything but his life.

585
00:41:58,659 --> 00:42:00,572
But he didn't renounce God.

586
00:42:01,597 --> 00:42:03,401
And God spared him.

587
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:07,296
So...

588
00:42:07,952 --> 00:42:09,225
who spared you?

589
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:27,047
Where did you get
those credit cards?

590
00:42:29,467 --> 00:42:30,697
I don't know.

591
00:42:35,716 --> 00:42:36,889
Yes, you do.

592
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,510
She said...

593
00:42:47,753 --> 00:42:48,944
she would find me.

594
00:42:51,251 --> 00:42:53,139
She said she would kill me.

595
00:42:55,804 --> 00:42:57,198
I promise you,

596
00:42:58,497 --> 00:42:59,768
she won't.
