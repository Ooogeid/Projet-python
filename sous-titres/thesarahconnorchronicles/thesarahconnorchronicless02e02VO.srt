<i>Previously on</i> Terminator:
The Sarah Connor Chronicles...

17
00:00:48,985 --> 00:00:51,638
Whatever happened with the explosion
flipped a switch.

18
00:00:51,758 --> 00:00:53,805
- You don't know what you do.
- You're gonna kill me.

19
00:00:53,925 --> 00:00:56,559
I love you, please.
I love you, John, and you love me.

20
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,436
You could fix her,
but I can't let you.

21
00:00:58,596 --> 00:00:59,938
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:01,943 --> 00:01:03,858
- I'm looking for the Connors.
- Sarah Connor?

23
00:01:04,018 --> 00:01:07,278
Mr. Dixon wanted to marry her before.
Maybe he's hiding her.

24
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:09,864
If one of them follows you here,
you'll have killed us.

25
00:01:10,024 --> 00:01:11,825
You died two years ago.

26
00:01:11,985 --> 00:01:14,202
It was cancer.
You died.

27
00:02:06,397 --> 00:02:07,589
Did you sleep?

28
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:12,260
What do you do
with a guard dog you can't trust?

29
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,829
What, that one?

30
00:02:15,103 --> 00:02:17,120
I'd have spent the night
talking to him.

31
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,775
I think she's outside
his jurisdiction.

32
00:02:19,895 --> 00:02:22,562
Just a wire knocked loose,
or something.

33
00:02:24,098 --> 00:02:25,198
So he says.

34
00:02:25,516 --> 00:02:26,815
Bitch is nothing but wire.

35
00:02:31,744 --> 00:02:33,634
It's only a matter of time.

36
00:02:41,115 --> 00:02:43,541
- It's healing quickly.
- Quicker than yours.

37
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,626
What about the rest of you?

38
00:02:45,928 --> 00:02:47,530
You're back to normal?

39
00:02:47,725 --> 00:02:50,131
- Things have changed, John.
- What things?

40
00:02:50,466 --> 00:02:52,426
You can't be trusted anymore.

41
00:02:52,546 --> 00:02:54,674
Me?
I can't be trusted anymore?

42
00:02:55,171 --> 00:02:57,138
You risked your life to fix me.

43
00:02:57,379 --> 00:02:59,516
That was
a very dangerous thing to do.

44
00:03:00,195 --> 00:03:01,998
That could upset people.

45
00:03:03,471 --> 00:03:04,769
They'll have to deal with.

46
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:07,941
Not them.

47
00:03:13,482 --> 00:03:14,985
What did she say?

48
00:03:16,388 --> 00:03:17,242
Nothing.

49
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:19,953
You should to school.

50
00:03:20,604 --> 00:03:21,955
I'll start on a new place.

51
00:03:22,471 --> 00:03:23,480
School?

52
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:25,041
Really?

53
00:03:25,201 --> 00:03:28,154
You always talk
about how english is so boring.

54
00:03:28,388 --> 00:03:31,422
I think we could all use boring today,
especially you.

55
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:33,842
What about her?

56
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,677
Last thing she is is boring.

57
00:03:37,171 --> 00:03:38,871
I'll keep her with us.

58
00:04:48,456 --> 00:04:52,462
So, you've been sitting in the same
spot since you bailed out on english.

59
00:04:53,271 --> 00:04:56,090
I figure it must have
some kind of redeeming value.

60
00:04:56,776 --> 00:04:59,886
You're in Mr. Hendrickson's
class, right?

61
00:05:00,046 --> 00:05:02,403
It's Mr. Amidon's class, weirdo.

62
00:05:02,523 --> 00:05:05,475
And, yeah, I'm third row,
second from the left.

63
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,183
Right.

64
00:05:08,917 --> 00:05:11,124
- And your name is?
- It's Riley.

65
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,274
Way to flatter a girl.

66
00:05:13,778 --> 00:05:16,032
Look, Riley, I really...

67
00:05:17,092 --> 00:05:19,253
- I don't mean to be rude.
- Wait, let me guess,

68
00:05:19,373 --> 00:05:22,075
you are just way too busy
for company right now.

69
00:05:22,508 --> 00:05:23,493
Obviously.

70
00:05:27,323 --> 00:05:29,707
- Don't you have somewhere to be?
- Don't you?

71
00:05:32,497 --> 00:05:33,795
You got 20 bucks?

72
00:05:35,028 --> 00:05:37,235
- Yeah. Why?
- I'm still hungry.

73
00:05:46,818 --> 00:05:48,306
There's three bedrooms.

74
00:05:48,426 --> 00:05:50,687
Four if you count the nursery,
and why wouldn't you?

75
00:05:51,092 --> 00:05:53,314
This one here's the master suite.

76
00:06:01,124 --> 00:06:02,826
I'll check the electric.

77
00:06:04,402 --> 00:06:06,035
So you live next door?

78
00:06:06,642 --> 00:06:09,069
- Where'd the owners go?
- They're in Tokyo for a year.

79
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:11,312
Bob's a last-minute fill-in
for his boss.

80
00:06:11,432 --> 00:06:13,793
Guy stroked out three days
before he was supposed to leave.

81
00:06:14,355 --> 00:06:15,473
Don't feel bad.

82
00:06:15,593 --> 00:06:18,923
I met the guy, and he grabbed my ass
with his wife five feet away.

83
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,134
Not this ass, of course.

84
00:06:26,382 --> 00:06:27,693
Car accident.

85
00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:31,144
The whole family.
Teaching that one to drive.

86
00:06:31,304 --> 00:06:33,479
You're kidding me.
I don't kid about teenagers.

87
00:06:35,183 --> 00:06:36,816
I can't even imagine.

88
00:06:37,508 --> 00:06:40,445
- How many months are you?
- Seven. I feel like a whale.

89
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,572
- You look great.
- I'm an orca

90
00:06:42,905 --> 00:06:43,990
with boobs.

91
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:46,617
There are worse things to be.

92
00:06:51,964 --> 00:06:53,958
Do you want to feel it?
It's cool.

93
00:06:54,118 --> 00:06:55,427
Everyone does.

94
00:06:59,901 --> 00:07:01,035
It's crazy, right?

95
00:07:01,533 --> 00:07:03,926
Once upon a time,
you were inside her.

96
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,555
We move in.

97
00:07:07,715 --> 00:07:10,016
As soon as I figure out
what to do with all this stuff.

98
00:07:10,176 --> 00:07:11,559
We'll take it, all of it.

99
00:07:15,406 --> 00:07:17,732
Mrs. Dixon.
I'm James Ellison, FBI.

100
00:07:18,893 --> 00:07:20,191
May I come in?

101
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:25,531
I'm not here as an FBI Agent.

102
00:07:25,691 --> 00:07:26,866
I'm here to help you.

103
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:32,413
I found it in a drawer
this morning after he went to work.

104
00:07:33,108 --> 00:07:34,749
Charlie hates guns.

105
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:36,459
Mich, I'm home.

106
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,323
What's going on here?

107
00:07:44,321 --> 00:07:45,843
We need to talk.

108
00:08:21,577 --> 00:08:22,380
Help!

109
00:08:28,587 --> 00:08:30,184
Check the perimeter.

110
00:08:34,391 --> 00:08:36,060
- Greenway.
- What?

111
00:08:37,263 --> 00:08:40,022
- What are you trying to say? Who?
- Stop Greenway.

112
00:08:40,182 --> 00:08:41,774
- Who's Greenway?
- Stop...

113
00:08:42,298 --> 00:08:43,568
Serrano point.

114
00:08:43,728 --> 00:08:45,194
The power plant, Serrano point.

115
00:08:45,354 --> 00:08:47,144
- Two days.
- Two days what?

116
00:08:47,264 --> 00:08:48,968
No, wait! No, no.

117
00:09:01,662 --> 00:09:03,256
He's from the future.

118
00:09:04,189 --> 00:09:06,591
Sent here by John.
I assume that's how he found us.

119
00:09:07,412 --> 00:09:10,386
- You sure that's not broken?
- I'm sure I don't care.

120
00:09:10,993 --> 00:09:14,265
You heard the guy.
Serrano point, two days, stop Greenway.

121
00:09:14,777 --> 00:09:17,798
- I'll handle it.
- I've seen how you handle it.

122
00:09:17,918 --> 00:09:20,421
I send you
and a land mine to do this,

123
00:09:20,656 --> 00:09:23,055
I guarantee someone's
ending up dead.

124
00:09:24,232 --> 00:09:25,821
Maybe it's supposed to.

125
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:28,529
And the other part
of that equation is maybe not.

126
00:09:30,421 --> 00:09:31,782
Are you coming?

127
00:09:56,361 --> 00:09:58,826
It looks a lot different
than I remember.

128
00:09:59,113 --> 00:10:02,203
In the future,
the Resistance controls this plant?

129
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:06,056
The battle of Avila Beach.
December 8, 2026.

130
00:10:06,176 --> 00:10:08,402
Humans regain control
of Serrano Point from Skynet.

131
00:10:08,672 --> 00:10:11,530
It's a key strategic hold.
It's one of our main sources of power.

132
00:10:11,735 --> 00:10:14,492
The guy who died said something
about two days.

133
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,578
- What's happening in two days?
- Maybe Greenway will tell us.

134
00:10:17,698 --> 00:10:19,554
Maybe Greenway's trying
to sabotage the plant.

135
00:10:19,674 --> 00:10:22,250
- You think he'll tell us that?
- I think he will.

136
00:10:36,226 --> 00:10:37,195
All right.

137
00:10:47,485 --> 00:10:50,366
<i>Nuclear power plants supply
20% of the nation's electricity.</i>

138
00:10:50,486 --> 00:10:51,779
<i>But how do they work?</i>

139
00:10:52,362 --> 00:10:54,555
<i>These lovely ladies
are uranium fuel rods.</i>

140
00:10:54,675 --> 00:10:56,467
<i>And they are hot.</i>

141
00:10:56,861 --> 00:10:59,094
<i>We're gonna start a chain reaction.</i>

142
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:01,646
<i>Nuts.</i>

143
00:11:02,408 --> 00:11:03,866
<i>Hot rods make the water boil.</i>

144
00:11:03,986 --> 00:11:07,878
<i>The steam spins turbines,
and abracadabra, energy.</i>

145
00:11:08,171 --> 00:11:10,363
<i>Of course we can't forget
to cool the steam back to water</i>

146
00:11:10,483 --> 00:11:12,449
<i>so the whole process can be repeated.</i>

147
00:11:12,569 --> 00:11:15,803
<i>Or else we'll have a massive compromise
of the containment system.</i>

148
00:11:16,361 --> 00:11:18,806
You know, I don't like taking on
new temps, I will tell you.

149
00:11:19,171 --> 00:11:22,073
Still, perfect score
on your placement exam.

150
00:11:22,425 --> 00:11:23,644
Security clearance.

151
00:11:23,804 --> 00:11:27,440
And I did have two janitors call in
with some personal emergencies, so...

152
00:11:29,018 --> 00:11:29,868
Come on.

153
00:11:33,353 --> 00:11:36,734
Is there a reason you two
are so rough around the edges?

154
00:11:36,854 --> 00:11:37,921
Car accident.

155
00:11:38,424 --> 00:11:40,429
'Cause I can't have
any problems in my plant.

156
00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:41,741
Car accident.

157
00:11:41,861 --> 00:11:44,957
Just stay out of the fuel building
without a protective gear on you,

158
00:11:45,117 --> 00:11:46,584
or you could get crapped up.

159
00:11:46,921 --> 00:11:48,571
That doesn't sound very pleasant.

160
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:51,589
It's plant talk
for getting exposed to radiation.

161
00:11:51,749 --> 00:11:53,299
Then you'd need a scrub down.

162
00:11:53,928 --> 00:11:55,301
You don't want a scrub down.

163
00:12:06,361 --> 00:12:07,438
Sarah's alive?

164
00:12:10,134 --> 00:12:11,110
In LA?

165
00:12:13,297 --> 00:12:16,764
And these things,
they're not human?

166
00:12:18,312 --> 00:12:20,131
I can't... I can't...

167
00:12:22,233 --> 00:12:24,130
I don't love her anymore, babe.

168
00:12:25,292 --> 00:12:26,618
Not like that.

169
00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:38,427
Of all the things you just told me,
she seems the least of your problems.

170
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:50,325
You two need to leave this place.

171
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,127
It's not safe here anymore.

172
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,860
Where is?

173
00:13:02,342 --> 00:13:03,327
Saint Bibiana.

174
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:07,178
- Saint who?
- Saint Bibiana.

175
00:13:07,298 --> 00:13:09,583
It's the school that I went to,
until ninth grade.

176
00:13:10,548 --> 00:13:12,294
Well, ninth and a half, technically.

177
00:13:12,794 --> 00:13:14,793
'Cause I got the boot for this.

178
00:13:15,084 --> 00:13:16,512
Can you believe it?

179
00:13:18,482 --> 00:13:21,450
So what's your story?
You look a little...

180
00:13:23,499 --> 00:13:24,974
Oh, it's just a car accident.

181
00:13:26,983 --> 00:13:30,020
- I was teaching my sister how to drive.
- Did everyone check out?

182
00:13:30,426 --> 00:13:32,273
- Check out?
- Is everyone okay?

183
00:13:33,378 --> 00:13:35,423
Oh, yeah, we're fine.
We're good.

184
00:13:35,888 --> 00:13:36,983
We're alive.

185
00:13:37,669 --> 00:13:38,446
For now.

186
00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:41,699
You're full of carrots and apples.

187
00:13:42,607 --> 00:13:43,909
Carrots and apples?

188
00:13:44,172 --> 00:13:45,817
Yeah, carrots and apples.

189
00:13:46,672 --> 00:13:47,912
You know, happy thoughts.

190
00:13:49,044 --> 00:13:51,041
I don't think
that's really an expression.

191
00:13:51,268 --> 00:13:52,084
It's not?

192
00:13:52,483 --> 00:13:54,253
I don't know,
maybe if you're on a farm.

193
00:14:01,296 --> 00:14:02,343
We're moving.

194
00:14:04,668 --> 00:14:06,891
My mom found us
a new place this morning.

195
00:14:07,358 --> 00:14:08,521
Is it nice?

196
00:14:09,106 --> 00:14:10,769
I don't know.
I haven't seen it.

197
00:14:11,003 --> 00:14:14,148
Are you serious? She hasn't, like,
shown you any pictures or anything?

198
00:14:14,982 --> 00:14:18,944
She's not really the picture type.

199
00:14:19,104 --> 00:14:21,419
Yeah, I totally know that type.

200
00:14:28,795 --> 00:14:30,614
So you wanna come see it?

201
00:14:31,297 --> 00:14:32,708
What, the mystery house?

202
00:14:33,418 --> 00:14:36,754
Yeah, the mystery house.
Do you wanna come with me and see it?

203
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:48,112
Check the cooling pump calibration
on the PWR board.

204
00:14:48,232 --> 00:14:49,422
It was fine yesterday.

205
00:14:49,542 --> 00:14:51,862
We're less than 36 hours
from going online.

206
00:14:51,982 --> 00:14:53,196
Check it again.

207
00:15:02,253 --> 00:15:05,241
I'd have a headache too if I had
to figure out what all those buttons do.

208
00:15:05,553 --> 00:15:08,118
- They're just vitamins.
- I'm Karen, by the way.

209
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,426
Carl.
You're new?

210
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:14,424
Brand spanking.
Just moved here from Texas.

211
00:15:14,544 --> 00:15:16,168
Really?
Whereabouts?

212
00:15:16,329 --> 00:15:18,671
- A little town called Elgin.
- Near Corpus Christi.

213
00:15:18,981 --> 00:15:21,112
I was stationed
at Ingleside naval base.

214
00:15:21,292 --> 00:15:22,424
Oh, imagine that.

215
00:15:22,732 --> 00:15:24,760
Neighbors and never even knew it.

216
00:15:25,983 --> 00:15:27,680
I hear there's a big test tomorrow.

217
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:29,771
The reactor's going back online?

218
00:15:30,822 --> 00:15:33,547
- Exactly how's that work?
- Hopefully perfectly.

219
00:15:34,603 --> 00:15:36,397
Greenway.
A word.

220
00:15:38,233 --> 00:15:40,468
- Nice meeting you, Karen.
- Likewise.

221
00:15:47,276 --> 00:15:50,488
There's cautious,
and there's just plain paranoid, okay?

222
00:15:50,696 --> 00:15:51,912
We're going online.

223
00:15:53,518 --> 00:15:55,499
Sure as hell not gonna
let you stall us.

224
00:16:39,853 --> 00:16:41,468
Well, I guess this is it.

225
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:43,343
Sweet.

226
00:16:47,468 --> 00:16:50,304
What's the matter?
Never brought a girl home before?

227
00:16:51,596 --> 00:16:52,473
No.

228
00:16:56,588 --> 00:16:59,647
- Well, I wonder where your room is.
- I don't know.

229
00:17:00,098 --> 00:17:01,815
Well, let's go look for it.

230
00:17:08,901 --> 00:17:10,567
She can't be serious.

231
00:17:34,258 --> 00:17:35,349
One more, please.

232
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,347
I'll have what he's having.

233
00:17:40,806 --> 00:17:42,425
I'm drinking tonic water.

234
00:17:43,451 --> 00:17:45,317
I won't have what he's having.

235
00:18:17,593 --> 00:18:19,127
I waitressed for years.

236
00:18:19,691 --> 00:18:21,979
On our break, the other girls
would smoke and I would...

237
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,723
Play with matches.

238
00:18:24,267 --> 00:18:26,608
Study for my computer classes.

239
00:18:27,114 --> 00:18:28,746
See how far it got me.

240
00:18:30,425 --> 00:18:32,125
So what's your story, Carl?

241
00:18:32,421 --> 00:18:34,495
How do you end up at Serrano Point?

242
00:18:35,192 --> 00:18:38,746
Started off in the Navy.
Served 12 years on a nuclear sub.

243
00:18:39,131 --> 00:18:42,040
- Every girl loves a uniform.
- My ex didn't.

244
00:18:42,846 --> 00:18:45,335
At least not the one
with my name stitched to it.

245
00:18:45,545 --> 00:18:47,755
- Bitch.
- Affirmative.

246
00:18:53,782 --> 00:18:55,523
That's a good scar.

247
00:18:56,882 --> 00:19:00,392
- Got a good story to go with it?
- Don't know about good, but a story.

248
00:19:07,283 --> 00:19:07,987
Hi.

249
00:19:08,657 --> 00:19:10,235
I'm Cindy.
I'm new in town.

250
00:19:11,532 --> 00:19:13,071
This looks like fun.

251
00:19:14,693 --> 00:19:17,576
Well, Cindy, this may look like fun,
but Bob here's

252
00:19:17,736 --> 00:19:20,170
got 50 bucks says he can beat
anyone in this bar.

253
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:21,758
Ain't that right, Bob?

254
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:23,749
I'll play you, Bob.

255
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,459
You ever played this game before?

256
00:19:25,845 --> 00:19:28,170
- How hard could it be?
- Oh, it's plenty hard, girl.

257
00:19:29,337 --> 00:19:31,213
Let me show you.
Now, what you're gonna do

258
00:19:31,376 --> 00:19:33,550
is take this stick
and lean over the table.

259
00:19:37,283 --> 00:19:39,357
Now slide it through your fingers.

260
00:19:40,205 --> 00:19:43,268
Relax, and get a real good feel.

261
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,440
That's right.

262
00:19:45,988 --> 00:19:47,161
Nice and easy.

263
00:19:56,609 --> 00:19:58,932
Still my shot.
Right, Bob?

264
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,585
So the first surgery,

265
00:20:02,932 --> 00:20:06,029
they went in,
took out most of the lymph nodes.

266
00:20:06,536 --> 00:20:09,398
Then they went back in four months ago
and cleaned out the rest.

267
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:12,318
Luckily, they were able to go
through the same incision.

268
00:20:13,571 --> 00:20:16,385
You don't hear many people with cancer
use the word "luckily."

269
00:20:16,545 --> 00:20:18,105
You'd be surprised.

270
00:20:18,225 --> 00:20:20,058
After four rounds of chemo,

271
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:22,933
you say a lot of things
you never thought you would.

272
00:20:23,094 --> 00:20:24,975
Most of them I won't repeat.

273
00:20:30,891 --> 00:20:33,558
Now I've gone and spooked you.

274
00:20:35,002 --> 00:20:36,070
No.

275
00:20:39,975 --> 00:20:40,992
Yeah.

276
00:20:41,669 --> 00:20:44,413
It's okay.
You wouldn't be the only one.

277
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,656
In a nuke plant, a guy with cancer
is sort of a black cat.

278
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:51,982
Funny thing is
20 years around nuclear reactors,

279
00:20:52,482 --> 00:20:54,255
I haven't been crapped up,
not once.

280
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:56,021
Lucky.

281
00:20:56,209 --> 00:20:57,342
See, lucky.

282
00:20:57,648 --> 00:20:58,884
There you go.

283
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:02,180
You seem like a good guy, Carl.

284
00:21:03,482 --> 00:21:06,602
If no one will drink with you
'cause you're sick, it's their loss.

285
00:21:09,579 --> 00:21:12,065
That isn't why
they won't drink with me.

286
00:22:07,415 --> 00:22:09,957
Somebody just smashed
Greenway's windshield.

287
00:22:10,117 --> 00:22:13,001
- Big guy with a crew cut.
- Greenway's got a lot of enemies.

288
00:22:13,325 --> 00:22:16,460
He stopped the last reactor test
because of safety concerns.

289
00:22:16,703 --> 00:22:17,897
If he stops it tomorrow,

290
00:22:18,017 --> 00:22:21,522
people are afraid the plant will get
shut down and they'll lose their jobs.

291
00:22:21,771 --> 00:22:24,262
He's concerned about one of
the sensor boards in the control room.

292
00:22:24,591 --> 00:22:27,182
It's showing slight irregularities
in the coolant pumps.

293
00:22:28,341 --> 00:22:30,811
I hacked into the computer
and read his notes.

294
00:22:32,453 --> 00:22:36,239
His boss is pressuring him to ignore it,
says it's nothing major.

295
00:22:36,561 --> 00:22:38,944
But if Greenway's right,
and there was a problem...

296
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,445
The reactor could melt down.

297
00:22:41,245 --> 00:22:42,948
Half the state would be contaminated.

298
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:45,196
Skynet wins.

299
00:22:46,723 --> 00:22:50,497
But if Greenway stops the test
and they close down the plant...

300
00:22:50,874 --> 00:22:52,708
Then the Resistance can't use it.

301
00:22:52,868 --> 00:22:53,959
Skynet wins.

302
00:22:59,167 --> 00:23:00,924
They didn't even leave any pickles.

303
00:23:02,014 --> 00:23:03,653
Check the freezer.

304
00:23:06,001 --> 00:23:07,346
My God, you're a genius.

305
00:23:08,926 --> 00:23:10,350
How did you know?

306
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:13,811
What's wrong?

307
00:23:14,786 --> 00:23:17,024
- It's my mom.
- Is that a problem?

308
00:23:24,143 --> 00:23:25,295
Who are you?

309
00:23:26,275 --> 00:23:27,587
This is Riley.

310
00:23:28,836 --> 00:23:30,787
- From school.
- Hi, mom.

311
00:23:33,574 --> 00:23:35,152
Let's talk, you and I.

312
00:23:48,671 --> 00:23:51,725
Riley from school.
You never mentioned her before.

313
00:23:51,989 --> 00:23:54,285
- That's because I just met her today.
- Really?

314
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:57,855
Now is not the time for this.

315
00:23:58,424 --> 00:23:59,952
Now is not the time.

316
00:24:01,522 --> 00:24:03,244
Well, when is the time?

317
00:24:04,133 --> 00:24:05,424
For me, I mean,

318
00:24:05,688 --> 00:24:07,313
to live my life.

319
00:24:09,871 --> 00:24:13,455
If you guys are gonna keep fighting,
I can leave.

320
00:24:13,615 --> 00:24:14,622
No.

321
00:24:16,462 --> 00:24:17,880
Everything's fine.

322
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,921
Do you think about the future much?

323
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:07,466
The future.

324
00:25:08,168 --> 00:25:11,347
When you're out of your house,
away from your family.

325
00:25:11,467 --> 00:25:13,641
You know, freedom.

326
00:25:18,503 --> 00:25:20,989
Yeah, I think about the future a lot.

327
00:25:25,739 --> 00:25:27,361
I don't know about freedom though.

328
00:25:29,003 --> 00:25:30,462
Parents are freaks.

329
00:25:32,129 --> 00:25:33,197
Yours too?

330
00:25:38,867 --> 00:25:40,208
Look at the stars.

331
00:27:22,547 --> 00:27:24,396
What are you doing in here?

332
00:27:24,557 --> 00:27:25,855
This is a restricted area.

333
00:27:26,171 --> 00:27:27,815
I'm looking for the supply room.

334
00:27:29,297 --> 00:27:32,028
One lift in the waste barrel area
leaked hydraulic fluid.

335
00:27:33,481 --> 00:27:36,408
You might as well take care
of it since you're here.

336
00:27:36,651 --> 00:27:37,658
Suit up.

337
00:27:37,894 --> 00:27:39,536
It can get nasty in there.

338
00:28:29,419 --> 00:28:31,696
What is that?
What does that mean?

339
00:28:32,474 --> 00:28:34,257
It means you just got crapped up.

340
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:02,118
Morning.

341
00:29:04,566 --> 00:29:07,040
- Did you sleep on the floor?
- Early riser.

342
00:29:07,608 --> 00:29:10,035
- What's that?
- What's it look like?

343
00:29:13,133 --> 00:29:14,213
Looks like a robot.

344
00:29:14,563 --> 00:29:16,799
It's a robot, big scary man,

345
00:29:17,424 --> 00:29:19,219
whatever, he's for you.

346
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:22,007
To protect you while you sleep.

347
00:29:22,518 --> 00:29:25,724
- Do I look like I need protection?
- If you don't want it then...

348
00:29:25,885 --> 00:29:27,074
No, no.

349
00:29:29,822 --> 00:29:31,523
It's very cool. Thank you.

350
00:29:31,865 --> 00:29:33,149
You're very welcome.

351
00:29:37,018 --> 00:29:39,949
So I guess I'm gonna try
to make it to English.

352
00:29:40,386 --> 00:29:41,685
What about you?

353
00:29:44,762 --> 00:29:46,642
Maybe... not today.

354
00:29:53,449 --> 00:29:55,146
Can I call you sometime?

355
00:29:59,887 --> 00:30:02,115
This is gonna sound really weird,

356
00:30:02,281 --> 00:30:06,256
but whenever you call me the first words
out of your mouth need to be the date.

357
00:30:07,261 --> 00:30:09,102
Day first, then the month, okay?

358
00:30:10,013 --> 00:30:11,896
And I'm doing this because?

359
00:30:14,188 --> 00:30:17,824
Because you wanna call me,
and that's just the way it is.

360
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:23,339
See you later then.

361
00:30:43,127 --> 00:30:44,470
These are my same clothes.

362
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,163
Aren't they crapped up?

363
00:30:48,343 --> 00:30:50,138
You know, it turns out they're not.

364
00:30:50,389 --> 00:30:52,768
Positive reading
must have been a hiccup.

365
00:30:52,888 --> 00:30:53,770
A hiccup?

366
00:30:53,931 --> 00:30:57,150
Yeah, sometimes these scanners
have a mind of their own.

367
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:20,404
Wanted to make sure
you got off all right.

368
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,446
Well, all right's pretty relative,
isn't it?

369
00:31:23,793 --> 00:31:25,112
How's she doing?

370
00:31:26,071 --> 00:31:29,723
Well, you know, we always thought
we'd raise kids in this house.

371
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:33,228
But you just can't plan
for anything now, can you?

372
00:31:37,557 --> 00:31:38,766
For the road.

373
00:31:44,763 --> 00:31:47,867
So what about you, are you gonna leave?
Or does God have a plan for you?

374
00:31:50,015 --> 00:31:51,112
We'll see.

375
00:31:51,903 --> 00:31:53,306
Yeah, we'll see.

376
00:31:54,152 --> 00:31:55,194
Thank you.

377
00:31:56,125 --> 00:31:57,430
Good luck.

378
00:32:15,763 --> 00:32:16,957
T minus two minutes.

379
00:32:17,139 --> 00:32:19,223
Coolant system numbers
are within tolerances.

380
00:32:19,343 --> 00:32:21,434
Of course they are.
Everything is fine.

381
00:32:21,554 --> 00:32:23,486
- But yesterday you said...
- Everything is fine.

382
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,918
- 16 november.
- <i>20:07.</i>

383
00:32:39,947 --> 00:32:42,969
Something's wrong with Greenway.
Are you at his house?

384
00:32:44,594 --> 00:32:45,550
I'm searching.

385
00:33:03,573 --> 00:33:05,111
Sarah, is Greenway there?

386
00:33:05,461 --> 00:33:07,711
<i>Are you telling me that he's there?</i>

387
00:33:09,267 --> 00:33:10,323
He's here.

388
00:33:11,003 --> 00:33:12,619
4, 3,

389
00:33:13,327 --> 00:33:14,871
2, 1.

390
00:33:18,974 --> 00:33:20,084
And we're online.

391
00:33:59,721 --> 00:34:02,901
Greenway, he's been replaced
by a machine.

392
00:34:04,733 --> 00:34:05,671
You heard me?

393
00:34:05,914 --> 00:34:08,383
Greenway has control of the plant,
and he's a machine.

394
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,167
You alive in there?

395
00:34:14,792 --> 00:34:16,432
I'm thinking about what to do.

396
00:34:16,903 --> 00:34:18,518
Since when did you do that?

397
00:34:20,236 --> 00:34:22,170
- What's going on?
- Turbine building.

398
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:24,524
Water valve's sprung a leak.

399
00:34:25,249 --> 00:34:26,577
Go fix it.

400
00:34:37,357 --> 00:34:39,205
Where the hell did you go?
Something's wrong.

401
00:34:39,647 --> 00:34:42,083
We need to turn on the water pumps.
We gotta cool it down.

402
00:34:42,243 --> 00:34:43,685
Everything is fine.

403
00:34:43,805 --> 00:34:45,971
Carl, the reactor's overheating.

404
00:34:46,282 --> 00:34:47,588
It's going to melt down.

405
00:34:54,645 --> 00:34:56,097
Please remain calm.

406
00:34:58,394 --> 00:35:00,852
You need to talk to Greenway.
He's lost his mind.

407
00:35:45,051 --> 00:35:46,272
<i>Code red.</i>

408
00:35:46,626 --> 00:35:49,400
<i>All employees must evacuate
immediately.</i>

409
00:35:52,794 --> 00:35:54,183
He's unconscious.

410
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:56,460
The reactor's overheating.

411
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,838
- Emergency manual.
- There's no way.

412
00:36:00,796 --> 00:36:02,038
Water tank leak.

413
00:36:02,198 --> 00:36:03,748
There's no time.
We gotta go.

414
00:36:03,909 --> 00:36:05,958
- I found the instructions.
- Let's go, now!

415
00:36:06,118 --> 00:36:08,503
No, no, no!
This is some kind of schematic.

416
00:36:09,908 --> 00:36:12,131
<i>NRC emergency.
Security code, please.</i>

417
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,509
I'm in the control room.
We need help.

418
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:16,562
<i>Sir, I need a security code.</i>

419
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,914
This is an emergency.
We don't know what we're doing.

420
00:36:20,034 --> 00:36:21,409
<i>Sir, I'm sorry but...</i>

421
00:36:33,138 --> 00:36:35,149
Hold it.
Stop right there.

422
00:37:57,478 --> 00:37:58,714
Are you okay?

423
00:38:00,603 --> 00:38:01,615
Are you okay?

424
00:38:04,508 --> 00:38:05,910
I'm okay.

425
00:39:07,504 --> 00:39:08,657
You're clean.

426
00:39:12,737 --> 00:39:15,147
When we jumped through time,
you told me I died of cancer.

427
00:39:15,307 --> 00:39:16,695
Yes, 2005.

428
00:39:19,098 --> 00:39:20,903
Am I still gonna get sick?

429
00:39:22,514 --> 00:39:23,695
I don't know.

430
00:39:26,636 --> 00:39:28,331
Is today how it happens?

431
00:39:29,344 --> 00:39:30,553
I don't know.

432
00:39:34,098 --> 00:39:36,085
What am I supposed to do, just wait?

433
00:39:38,153 --> 00:39:40,339
Like a time bomb,
am I just gonna go off someday?

434
00:39:40,766 --> 00:39:41,988
I don't know.

435
00:39:43,784 --> 00:39:44,784
Am I?

436
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,318
You have a new friend.

437
00:40:05,256 --> 00:40:06,659
Her name is Riley.

438
00:40:09,205 --> 00:40:12,496
And you probably creeped her out.
When you talk, don't stand so close.

439
00:40:12,906 --> 00:40:14,539
I was assessing her threat level.

440
00:40:16,284 --> 00:40:17,284
Well?

441
00:40:18,407 --> 00:40:19,587
Am I safe?

442
00:40:21,277 --> 00:40:23,884
I don't know.
Girls are complicated.

443
00:40:29,346 --> 00:40:31,243
About what you said before,

444
00:40:32,642 --> 00:40:34,837
about not being able to trust me.

445
00:40:35,407 --> 00:40:36,407
Yes?

446
00:40:37,347 --> 00:40:39,774
I don't have to prove
anything to anyone.

447
00:40:42,347 --> 00:40:43,347
Anyone.

448
00:40:44,662 --> 00:40:45,892
Including you.

449
00:40:59,765 --> 00:41:00,917
<i>16 november.</i>

450
00:41:02,349 --> 00:41:04,377
You got it right.
What's up?

451
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:06,002
<i>Just practicing.</i>

452
00:42:54,253 --> 00:42:56,105
Because of this tragic incident,

453
00:42:56,225 --> 00:42:58,045
the owners of Serrano Point

454
00:42:58,165 --> 00:43:00,846
and six other power plants
across the nation

455
00:43:01,408 --> 00:43:04,527
are entering into a partnership
with my corporation,

456
00:43:04,712 --> 00:43:06,170
Automyte Systems.

457
00:43:06,603 --> 00:43:08,881
New automated technology
we've developed

458
00:43:09,042 --> 00:43:11,615
will be implemented
in all control rooms.

459
00:43:11,915 --> 00:43:13,385
These sophisticated machines

460
00:43:13,545 --> 00:43:16,025
will eliminate the possibility
of human error

461
00:43:16,333 --> 00:43:18,015
and prevent a major disaster.
