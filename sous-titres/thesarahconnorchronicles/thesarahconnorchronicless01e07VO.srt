00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,020
In the future,my son will lead
mankind in a war against skynet,

3
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:16,620
a computer system programmed
to destroy the world.

4
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,560
It has sent machines back through time.

5
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,120
Some to kill him.

6
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,010
One to protect him.

7
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,680
Today we fight to stop skynet
from ever being created.

8
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,250
To change our future.

9
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,030
To change his fate.

10
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,660
The war to save mankind begins now.

Chronicles Season01 Episode07</font>

13
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:45,850
Previously on terminator:
The sarah connor chronicles...

14
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:50,260
my turk plays chess at a level that
could defeat every human player that

15
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,740
has ever lived and
probably ever will live.

16
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,540
This is my partner,dimitri shipkoff.

17
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:57,950
I built the tubut dimitri
taught it to play chess.

18
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,930
you talk about it like it's human.

19
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:01,210
well,you never know.

20
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,360
Show me what you found.

21
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,340
No name,but he's got
this tattoo on his arm.

22
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:07,480
That's a tattoo from a skynet work camp.

23
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:08,910
He's a resistance fighter.

24
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,600
Than you know him in the future.

25
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:11,760
So do you do.

26
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,440
He's one of your best soldiers.

27
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:14,720
It was you,wasn't it?

28
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,250
You wanted to kill him,and you did.

29
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,080
I didn't do it.

30
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,750
All I wanted was the turk.

31
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,970
Somebody else killed
him and took the machine.

32
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,890
You gotta get out of herE.

33
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,820
If you haven't figured it
out,I have a t-888 on my ass.

34
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:30,580
Now if you found me,it will too.

35
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:33,660
He needs a doctor.

36
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,700
what,so you're just gonna
go out and kidnap one?

37
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,290
Don't let that thing touch me.

38
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,250
- We have to stop you bleeding.
- Get away from me!

39
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,570
You don't even know who this guy is!

40
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,620
He's your uncle.

41
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,260
He doesn't know.

42
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,810
CENTRAL LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT

43
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:05,350
Possible forced entry and sabotage
at vista terrace power planet.

44
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,240
All available units respond,code 3.

45
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,500
they say when a person
dies,the soul lives on.

46
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,840
The soul.

47
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,900
The thing that separates
us from the machines.

48
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,010
Cameron had burned the metal monster.

49
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,740
2,000 degrees.

50
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,020
I suppose they did the same to andy.

51
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,970
There was nothing left of either.

52
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:13,010
Nothing that told the story
of who or what they were.

53
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,360
Gone is gone.

54
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,680
Ashes to ashes,dust to dust.

55
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:28,140
When I go,bury me in the earth.

56
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,800
A part of me died years ago with kyle
reese,but a part of me lives on in john.

57
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:39,650
It's that not a soul,I
don't know what is.

58
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,670
The triple eight.

59
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,410
Vaporized.

60
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,090
The russian,dimitri.

61
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,450
You found him?

62
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,940
He took off after andy's murder.

63
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,230
No,if he has the turk,then...

64
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,480
put the machine on it.

65
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,600
She'll find
him.It's--

66
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:13,900
I know.

67
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,790
It's what they do.

68
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,110
How is he?

69
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,750
Better.

70
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,900
Still pretty out of it.

71
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,880
Is he,uh,gonna stay here or what?

72
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,650
Let's see if he lives first.

73
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:39,510
And somewhere in this city,a
naked cop bleeds in an alley.

74
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,360
The hand.

75
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:43,120
I couldn't acquire it.

76
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:43,980
Why not?

77
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,260
The fbi has it.

78
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:51,160
You're playing hooky.

79
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:53,170
Today--no,i can't
miss class today,mom.

80
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,150
Well,we have to find the hand.

81
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,470
Destroy it. No loose ends.

82
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,260
- Cyberdyne built skynet-
- with the chip,remember?

83
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,110
And the hand.

84
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,640
Look,the feds have it now,mom.

85
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,420
I can't help.

86
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:07,860
Besides,absent gets me on the radar.

87
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,180
I can play hooky.

88
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,370
Find dimitri.

89
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,340
Derek says he has a
sister who teaches ballet.

90
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,590
Start with her.

91
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,170
Low profile,no guns.

92
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,420
You might want to change

93
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,690
yeah,this is sergeant johnson,

94
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,550
senior property over at lapd.

95
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,490
Got a little problem.
Wonder if you could help me.

96
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,480
What's going on?

97
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,510
I got this new booking officer rookie.

98
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,120
Between you and me,I think he was drunk
when logged evidence on a robbery we had.

99
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,280
Might have ended up
on your felony escape.

100
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,100
What are you missing?

101
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,030
Prosthetic hand.

102
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,940
- Really?
- Really.

103
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,930
D.R.Number?

104
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:54,100
I can send someone to pick it up.

105
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,730
Uh,I don't see any hand on here.

106
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,890
You sure?

107
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,030
Item 17.

108
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:01,540
Hang on a second.

109
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,560
- Agent ellison?
- yeah?

110
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,370
I got lapd property on the line.

111
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,830
They're asking about a hand.
From your felony escape.

112
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,340
They have it listed on the authorization,but
we don't have a record of it.

113
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,290
I never saw any hand,fake or otherwise.

114
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,980
Agent in charge says he never saw it.

115
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,050
Want to talk to him?

116
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:21,340
No,no,I'll take his word. Thanks.

117
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:10,770
and wonder if god or the devil...

118
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:16,350
or even death itself was sending me a message
from the future all the way back through time.

119
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,100
Machines,sarah.

120
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,170
Machines.

121
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,060
You can pretend they're
not,but they are coming.

122
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:26,130
And they are faster and stronger.

123
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,680
And they've been built
to do one perfect thing.

124
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,760
To kill you.

125
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,170
They will kill you.

126
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,600
And your friends and your family.

127
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,230
And your mother and your father.

128
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,800
And kyle reese and your son.

129
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,940
Your son!

130
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,700
They will kill everyone you
love and everyone you hold close,

131
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,200
and there is nothing
you can do about it.

132
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,870
Because they are coming.

133
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,380
They are coming,and they will find you.

134
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:01,330
Because that's what they
do! That's all they do!

135
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,680
- That's all they do!
- I need help here!

136
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,450
- Get in here!
- They'll kill you!

137
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,900
- Come on,where's the stuff?
- They will kill you!

138
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:21,070
Now if what you're saying is
true,sarah,surely there would be some evidence.

139
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,520
No one believes me.

140
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,070
Thank you.

141
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,960
So this is where sarah connor
spent three years of her life.

142
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,700
This is it.

143
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,410
Dr. Silverman retired
right after she escaped.

144
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,220
Where is he these days?

145
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:43,440
Got himself a cabin in the
mountains near arrowhead.

146
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:46,160
Growing his own
vegetables,working on his book.

147
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,590
We don't hear much from him anymore.

148
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,410
I'd love to talk to any other staff
that was here when she escaped.

149
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,820
Unfortunately,there's no one left.

150
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,030
Not even a janitor?

151
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,480
How long would you work here
if you could find another job?

152
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:00,790
Right.

153
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,720
Good.

154
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:11,250
Long reach down.

155
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,050
Excellent turnout. Hold!

156
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,000
Hold.

157
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:20,540
And close.

158
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,050
Beautiful. Thank you.

159
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,480
See you all next week.

160
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,390
What is she doing?

161
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,650
Pas de chat.

162
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:50,590
Step of the cat.

163
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:54,900
Will you show me?

164
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:57,210
That is the advanced class.

165
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:00,080
You are a beginner,yeah?

166
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,650
You have taken ballet before.

167
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,350
No.

168
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,480
The height is nice. Beautiful feet.

169
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:19,420
But your upper body is
a little mechanical,yeah?

170
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:22,500
Remember,you are a cat.

171
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,740
I'm a cat.

172
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,290
Come next week.

173
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:32,400
We need to develop your
flexibility and your imagination.

174
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,280
Remember...

175
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:37,290
dance is the hidden
language of the soul,yeah?

176
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,180
Stop coming here.

177
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,800
Where is he?

178
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:43,550
I don't know where he is.

179
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,960
Don't play with me Maria.

180
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:46,820
Please leave

181
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,500
He owes me money

182
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,950
Give him the message or he'll be sorry

183
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,570
What are you doing?

184
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:08,010
What's it look like?

185
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:11,930
Looks like you're loading guns that
I know for a fact were already loaded.

186
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,740
True enough.

187
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,230
I loaded 'em.

188
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,600
Look,no offense.

189
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:23,390
I just don't like firing a
weapon I didn't set myself.

190
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:28,180
Anyway,you should take it
into the kitchen or something.

191
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,470
Mom wouldn't like you
doing this in her room.

192
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,640
Why?

193
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:38,040
Because it's her room.

194
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:42,280
Listen,um...

195
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:45,220
the paramedic that patched me up.

196
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,240
Where'd he come from?

197
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,840
That's charlie.

198
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:50,220
He was her boyfriend.

199
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,040
Her fiance.

200
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:54,610
Actually,a long time ago.

201
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,820
He's a liability.

202
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,350
Look,man,he's not gonna tell anybody.

203
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,940
How do you know?

204
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,140
Because I know him. I trust him.

205
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:06,670
I can't believe you trust anybody.

206
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,490
Maybe it's just him.

207
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,010
You trust the machine.

208
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,300
- Cameron-- -
yeah,cameron.

209
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,150
What a joke.

210
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,790
Walking around with a name.

211
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,330
Like it's a person. It's not a person.

212
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,550
It's not something
you should be trusting.

213
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,410
what's going on?

214
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,330
Nothing.

215
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,110
I need you to get on the
computer and find an address.

216
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,350
You're making a mistake.

217
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,200
How's that?

218
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:40,650
The machine has gotta go.

219
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:43,280
This morning you had me sending
her out to do our dirty work.

220
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,260
Dirty work is all they're good for.

221
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,930
Don't let yourself think that
you can train them like a pet,

222
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,680
because it'll be the
last thing that you think.

223
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:52,310
- John- - john doesn't
know everything.

224
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,980
You should be resting.

225
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,780
They never rest.

226
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:27,380
You can't have that thing here.

227
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:30,000
Can't sleep with it here.

228
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,610
That gonna help?

229
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,140
You never know.

230
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:42,040
Does it help to sleep
on the whole trunk?

231
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:47,740
Go into my bedroom
again,I'll bust your head.

232
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,860
What happened with the ballet teacher?

233
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:23,820
Dance is the hidden
language of the soul.

234
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,990
First you have to have a soul.

235
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,650
I mean about dimitri or the turk.

236
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,050
I'm going back today.

237
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,650
What's the status on the hand?

238
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,480
- got a good idea who has it.
- Who?

239
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,170
Fbi agent ellison.

240
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,620
Same guy that questioned
me in county lockup?

241
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:40,530
What,they only have one
fbi agent in this town?

242
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:43,130
Only one who can put
this whole thing together.

243
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,000
From what I saw at his
house,maybe he already has.

244
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:48,020
Pancakes.

245
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,650
We eat at the table.

246
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,080
Your pancakes are getting cold.

247
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:01,450
Here's dr. Silverman's address.

248
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,110
- You're not hungry?
- No.

249
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,690
Since when?

250
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:49,100
Ms. Connor,I'm from dcfs.

251
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,950
I've brought some paperwork for you.

252
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,980
Everything should be in order.

253
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:55,290
All we have to do is
cross the t's dot the **

254
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,940
basically states that you
voluntarily and unequivocally consent,

255
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:03,570
that you have been advised of the legal
consequences of this relinquishment,

256
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,800
that you understand that
your consent is irrevocable.

257
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:10,170
And once these papers are signed,all
parental rights will be terminated.

258
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,890
And sign here.

259
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,580
We'll get a certified copy to the judge.

260
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,260
Guess you're not hungry either.

261
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:16,770
You might have fooled them,but not me.

262
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,410
I know you.

263
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,860
I know you too.

264
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,020
dr. Silverman.

265
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,050
Can I help you?

266
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,460
Special agent james ellison.

267
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:51,040
Oh,hello. What can I do for you,agent?

268
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:54,470
I'd like to talk to
you about sarah connor.

269
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:57,190
You like to come in?

270
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,120
Thank you.

271
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,890
Well,I don't like to use the term
textbook in relation to any of my patients,

272
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:13,130
but sarah connor was
depressed,anxiety-ridden,manic...

273
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:16,020
violent with paranoid delusions.

274
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,200
Is that what it was?

275
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,130
Delusions?

276
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:21,950
Robots,soldiers of
the future,apocalypse.

277
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:24,020
You tell me.

278
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:30,570
Also she could be remarkably charming.

279
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:33,460
Even persuasive.

280
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:37,640
Beware of false prophets.

281
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:42,290
You a man of the book?

282
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,330
It has brought me comfort at times.

283
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,230
More tea?

284
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,390
Um,yes,yes,thank yoU.

285
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:58,410
The thing that most people don't understand about
psychiatry is that it is an imperfect science.

286
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,340
What are you doing here?

287
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:27,440
Watching you.

288
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,470
I'm--I'm a little
out of shape.

289
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,650
Teaching takes all my time.

290
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:38,610
My brother says if you want to be good at
anything you have to practice every day.

291
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,920
Your brother is right.

292
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,820
Do you have a brother?

293
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,550
Yes.

294
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,860
Is he a dancer like you?

295
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,200
He plays chess.

296
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,630
So does my brother.

297
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,070
Excuse me.

298
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:03,770
i can see to it that
you never dance again

299
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,030
i can see to it

300
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,240
...that you will never dance again

301
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,640
Get lost.

302
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:19,090
Do you have any idea who this is?

303
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,120
No.

304
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,480
Do you?

305
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:23,240
Who are you?

306
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,220
You're just a girl.

307
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,600
How did you do that?

308
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:28,280
I'm looking for your brother.

309
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,850
Are you police?

310
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:33,530
I've already told the
police everything I know.

311
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,230
No,I'm not police.

312
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:37,790
But I do find them useful.

313
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,400
What do you want?

314
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,790
I can help your brother.

315
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,480
Tell me where he is.

316
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,360
Un--untie
me.

317
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:58,350
Hmm,fbi. That's a good touch.

318
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:02,840
What--who--who
do you think I am?

319
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,070
I know who you are.

320
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,590
Coming here asking about sarah connor.

321
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,200
Yes.

322
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,840
Matthew 7:15.

323
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:17,970
The full verse is,"beware of false prophets
"which come to you in sheep's clothing,

324
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:22,140
but inwardly they are ravening wolves."

325
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:26,770
You're from the future.
You're one of them.

326
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,550
I'm--oh,come
on.

327
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:35,340
Okay,if I was who you
say I am,then how could--

328
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:37,290
how could you poison me?

329
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,320
The tea was a test.

330
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:41,370
But then it occurred to me that
you could be an advanced model

331
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:47,150
smart enough to trick me into
thinking you were passed out.

332
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:49,150
Oh,come on.

333
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,590
Look...

334
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,440
okay,kidnapping an fbi
agent is a federal offense.

335
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,450
Carries a sentence of life in prison.

336
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:02,720
If--if you let me go now,we'll
forget this ever happened,okay?

337
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:03,730
Once you're
far away--

338
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,630
wait,wait,whoa,no!

339
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:07,170
You can't,no!

340
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,830

No--

341
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:34,110
John hasn't been
answering his cell phone.

342
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:37,430
When he gets home,you
tell him we need to talk.

343
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,550
Where you heading?

344
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,140
Arrowhead.

345
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,690
I think ellison might be there.

346
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:47,310
He's a strong boy.

347
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:50,650
You know,strong--
strong opinions.

348
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,880
I don't know where he gets that.

349
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:54,220
His father?

350
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,920
Out of the picture.

351
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,950
That's too bad.

352
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:01,340
Can I ask you about my brother?

353
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:04,010
Kyle?

354
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:07,680
John told me he died fighting.

355
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,910
Do you know...where he is now?

356
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:15,610
In the grass.

357
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:18,970
I can take you there
someday if you want.

358
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:25,810
It's an honest mistake.

359
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:28,150
Can't be too careful.

360
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,400
So...tell me.

361
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:40,140
Do you believe inhe apocalypse,agent?

362
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,190
yeah,um...I've read revelations.

363
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:56,370
Could it be that the apocalypse in the book and the
predictions of sarah connor are one and the same?

364
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:05,710
Um,I suppose it's possible.

365
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:09,170
What do you think?

366
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,990
He came down the hall.

367
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,480
It was a large man.

368
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:17,470
I thought it was a man until...

369
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:23,810
he threw the guard through the
window just like a rag doll.

370
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,220
Not an ounce of emotion.

371
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:29,910
This blank--
like a death mask.

372
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,720
Then the other one came.

373
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,980
There was two of them?

374
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:35,470
There were different.

375
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,430
The second one was almost beautiful.

376
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:41,800
Like perfect.

377
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:44,590
Like a changeling.

378
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:48,710
The face of mercury.

379
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,240
What about sarah?

380
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,370
She was there.

381
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,540
She was on the floor.

382
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:56,870
And the boy was with her.

383
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:58,960
He was screaming.

384
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:03,480
And then the--the first one,the
big one,I'll never forget.

385
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:07,440
He--he reached
out his hand

386
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:11,860
and he said,"come with
me if you want to live."

387
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:16,150
Like god reaching out to man.

388
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:21,000
Like-- like the
sistine chapel.

389
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:24,960
The hand of god.

390
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:27,160
Hand of god.

391
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,600
Yeah.

392
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:33,500
Though...

393
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:37,120
there's no proof,so
we don't talk about it.

394
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,140
All of us who were there.

395
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:42,290
What if I told you I have proof?

396
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,650
What do you mean?

397
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:48,910
A piece of evidence I found
during my investigation.

398
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:54,400
That's why I came to you.

399
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:58,150
For your corroboration.

400
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:03,670
To show you that sarah wasn't crazy.

401
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:09,770
Nobody...is crazy.

402
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:12,750
What is it?

403
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,450
The hand of god.

404
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:50,630
Good thing you told me about this.

405
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,990
Yeah.

406
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:56,170
I told you I'm--
I'm on your side.

407
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,530
I wish that were true.

408
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:00,250
What does that mean?

409
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:05,220
Do you know what would happen if
the wrong people got a hold of this?

410
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,550
I can't let you stop her.

411
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,340
She's dead.

412
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:13,680
Well...so was jesus once.

413
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,920
You won't feel a thing,I promise.

414
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,760

What--no,no!

415
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:24,210
Dug up some clean t-shirts for you.

416
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,930
Thanks.

417
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,990
I wasn't sure how many you'd need.

418
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:32,170
Depends on how long you're staying.

419
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:37,170
Not that great sleeping
on the couch,is it?

420
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:40,160
Slept on a few of them myself.

421
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:42,140
Yeah?

422
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,820
When was that?

423
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:46,400
When my mom was locked up.

424
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,290
I kicked around.

425
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:52,090
With friends and foster families.

426
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:54,590
Mom was in prison?

427
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,830
Mental hospital.

428
00:30:56,890 --> 00:31:00,520
You go around blowing up buildings
and ranting about robots,it happens.

429
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,860
It sounds rough.

430
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:11,910
There was this,uh--
there was this one family.

431
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,110
Todd and janelle.

432
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:17,470
I was with them for a while,and,uh...

433
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,380
they were okay.

434
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,230
Of course,I hated them.

435
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:23,570
They wanted to adopt me.

436
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:27,550
I'm sure your mom would've
died before she let that happen.

437
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:31,440
Yeah,you'd think.

438
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,410

Look,john--

439
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:47,040
What can happen to a person inside
four walls,um,screws with your head.

440
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:50,720
Makes you do things you
never thought you'd do.

441
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:54,510
Some people never give up.

442
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:59,640
Some people always fight.

443
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:04,380
Fewer than you think.

444
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:09,640
So you ever wonder what
happened to todd and janelle?

445
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:11,400
No.

446
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:15,130
I know what happened.

447
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:20,130
I got them killed.

448
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:24,750
who is she?

449
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,630
my friend

450
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:28,610
i told you not to bring anyone here

451
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:29,640
she can help us

452
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,340
someone could have followed you

453
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:38,800
i had to tell someone. she can help us

454
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:39,860
what are you thinking?

455
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:42,490
what can she help us with?

456
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,900
Tell him. Come on.

457
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,880
i have money

458
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:51,620
You're the one who
reported the turk missing.

459
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,030
Do you have more?

460
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:55,010
What happened to it?

461
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,240
A man came to see me.

462
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:59,540
Offered me money to steal the turk.

463
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:02,430
I owed a lot of money to the people who
helped me bring my sister into this country.

464
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:07,890
So I changed the endgame protocols in
order for it to lose its last match.

465
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:11,570
If we'd won,and we would've won,I
never could've got her out of there.

466
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:16,520
We--I was paid
money for it. 20000

467
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,810
It wasn't enough.

468
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,230
I need more of these.

469
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:28,390
Please,I need more of thesE.

470
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,980
Who bought the turk?

471
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,580
That's all I have.

472
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:38,880
Okay?

473
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,350
Thank you for explaining.

474
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,520
Where are you going? Hey,where you go?

475
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:47,310
You promised you would help us!

476
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:41,670
Oh,my god.

477
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,980
I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

478
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,730
Apology accepted.

479
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:10,850
help! help!

480
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,850
get up!

481
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,360
Where is it?

482
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,580
She took it.

483
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:33,790
What? Who?

484
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:36,230
Sarah connor.

485
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,300
She took it.

486
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:42,520
She took it.

487
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:01,870
Did you find the turk?

488
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,830
Dimitri stole it from
andy,then sold it to a man.

489
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:06,310
Who?

490
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,620
Where's dimitri now?

491
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:12,130
Dead.

492
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,860
So is his sister.

493
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:15,310
Did you kill them?

494
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:16,690
No.

495
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:19,330
It wasn't my mission.

496
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:41,500
I never wanted you to see that tape.

497
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,660
I was gonna destroy it.

498
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:51,700
But since you did,did
you notice the date?

499
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,680
The date on the tape.

500
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:04,990
June 8,1997.

501
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:07,630
Do you know that date?

502
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,990
I do now.

503
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:17,340
That's the date you
gave up being my mother.

504
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,810
That's the date I broke out of there.

505
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,950
The day you came for
me,I was coming for you.

506
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,780
Because about three seconds
after I signed that paper,

507
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,930
I knew I couldn't live without it.

508
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,870
I was coming for you,and
I was gonna die trying.

509
00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:00,170
You almost did.

510
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,490
So did you.

511
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:09,610
And you were mad as hell about it.

512
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:13,610
You yelled at me.

513
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:16,810
Told me what a stupid move it was.

514
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,580
I might've oversold that a little.

515
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,710
I'll always find you.

516
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:38,660
I'll always find you.

517
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,490
there was a time I was a hero to my son.

518
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:47,040
He thought I walked on water.

519
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:49,770
He knows better now.

520
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,360
We all have weak moments.

521
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:04,640
Moments where we lose faith.

522
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:10,390
But it's our flaws,our
weaknesses,that make us human.

523
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,850
They're here.

524
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:28,110
They're here.

525
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,800
They're here!

526
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:36,030
They're everywhere!

527
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,090
They're here!

528
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:42,140
They're here!

529
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:46,620
science now performs
miracles like the gods of old,

530
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:50,660
creating life from blood cells,or
bacteria,or a spark of metal.

531
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,470
But they're perfect creatures.

532
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:56,030
And in that way,they
couldn't be less human.

533
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:59,130
There are things machines will never do.

534
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,140
Theyannot possess faith.

535
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:03,280
They cannot commune with god.

536
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:12,240
"every tree that no bringeth forth good
fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire."

537
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:26,960
they cannot appreciate beauty.

538
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:29,930
They cannot create art.

539
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:37,330
If they ever learn these
things,they won't have to destroy us.

540
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:40,810
They'll be us.
