1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:06,440
In the future, my son will lead mankind in a war against skynet...

2
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,460
A computer system programmed to destroy the world.

3
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:14,510
It has sent machines back through time.

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,750
Some to kill him, one to protect him.

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,290
Today we fight to stop skynet from ever being created.

6
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,480
To change our future.

7
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:27,050
To change his fate.

8
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:31,420
The war to save mankind begins now.

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,810
Previously on terminator: the sarah connor chronicles: i haven't seen you around here before.

10
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,130
Did you just move here?

11
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:45,050
Yeah.

12
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,170
Sucks for you.

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,780
We can't stay here, john.

14
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:50,840
No one knows us.

15
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:51,580
We're safe.

16
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,600
Don't you think that, john!

17
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,490
No one is ever safe.

18
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,190
Fbi.

19
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:02,850
Your fiancee killed a man because she believes that in the future, 
you'll invent a comput s stete that declares war on the world.

20
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,130
Cameron phillips.

21
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:04,770
Here.

22
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,750
Do we have a john reese?

23
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,250
Come with me if you wanna live.

24
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:18,760
I'm not who they think i am.

25
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,260
You changed the future, you just didn't change it enough.

26
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,390
So you can do it again.

27
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:23,540
You wanna stop skynet?

28
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:24,540
This is the way.

29
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:27,010
Mom.

30
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:28,330
We gotta go, now!

31
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:29,390
Do it!

32
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:34,510
Where are we?

33
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,420
Same where.

34
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:36,340
Different when.

35
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:50,170
A wise man once said "know thyself.

36
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,200
" easier said than done.

37
00:01:53,140 --> 00:02:01,250
I've had nine aliases, 23 jobs, spoken four languages, 
and spent three years in a mental hospital for speaking the truth.

38
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,280
At least when i was there, 
i could use my real name.

39
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:08,040
Through it all, i've always known 
who i am and why i'm here.

40
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,460
Protect my son.

41
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,530
Prepare for the future.

42
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,650
But lately it's gotten harder to control.

43
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:28,530
Even as i try to help john find firm ground in this new world, 
the battlefield shifts beneath our feet.

44
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,440
Maybe it's all catching up to me.

45
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:37,620
Maybe if you spend your life hiding who you are, 
you might filallenend fooling yourself.

46
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,700
Hey, how's it going?

47
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:44,850
All right.

48
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,440
You bought me the wrong needle nose pliers though.

49
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,110
I did?

50
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,350
You said red handles.

51
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,570
Oh.

52
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,840
I'm sorry.

53
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,910
I, uh...

54
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,140
I guess i'm still...

55
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,380
I don't know.

56
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,060
I've been calling it time-lag.

57
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:01,890
What?

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,820
It's like jetlag, but for time travel.

59
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:05,800
Time-lag.

60
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,110
Yeah, sounds about right.

61
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,650
Hey, you kw what would really help with time-lag?

62
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,880
Some fresh air.

63
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:11,720
John.

64
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,390
I've been cooped up here for three days.

65
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,220
I know.

66
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,020
No, you don't know, because you keep going outside.

67
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,020
And so will you when we get new ids.

68
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,370
So let's get them already.

69
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:22,820
We will.

70
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:24,650
Can you be patient, please?

71
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,660
It's not just a name.

72
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:27,560
It's a legend.

73
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,220
A life.

74
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,030
A whole new you.

75
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,560
We go through this every time.

76
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,980
This is different.

77
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,630
New ids today?

78
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,150
It's been three days.

79
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,230
I want my new name.

80
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,880
I want that whole new me.

81
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,780
Can't you track down enrique?

82
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,830
All right, i'll track down enrique.

83
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,030
Old friend.

84
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,860
Ten years ago he was the best fake paper guy around.

85
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,760
John sent back better ones.

86
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:07,050
You cannot walk into the living room after three days-- three days-- 
and now after three days, now you tell me there are other people here?

87
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,610
Resistance fighters.

88
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,390
Resistance fighters.

89
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,060
Humans.

90
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,200
Sent back from the future by john.

91
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:16,970
And what?

92
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:23,550
Are they manning some kind of apocalyptic paramilitary 
convenience store filled with fake ids, and guns, and money?

93
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,830
Yes.

94
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,250
You done yelling at her yet?

95
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:31,760
I'm not yelling.

96
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,850
Right.

97
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,320
So look, mom, there's no turkey.

98
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,010
Turkey.

99
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:35,920
It's in there, john.

100
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:36,620
No.

101
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:40,660
Just move the food around and the turkey will reveal itself to you.

102
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:41,810
Mom, i already looked.

103
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:46,860
There's no-- oh, yeah, there it is.

104
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,820
Thanks.

105
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,110
And stay inside.

106
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,990
No id means-- yeah, i know what no id means.

107
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,250
How many guys are we meeting?

108
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,520
Four.

109
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,010
These resistance fighters, they know you?

110
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,870
They've seen me before.

111
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,720
I've seen that before.

112
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,490
Kyle reese had one.

113
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,790
Skynet work camp.

114
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,160
Prisoner.

115
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,390
Please remain calm.

116
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,140
Oh, my god.

117
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,960
You told me we'd be safe!

118
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,700
Safe!

119
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,710
Was that safe?

120
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,580
Three days and we're at war.

121
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,500
Why jump at all?

122
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,590
Why not stay in the past?

123
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,490
I had seven more years to get ready.

124
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,750
To get him ready.

125
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,760
No, you wouldn't have.

126
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,330
Why not?

127
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,090
Because you died two years ago.

128
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,480
December 4, 2005.

129
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,290
You died.

130
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,940
So what i'm getting is these things, they're here.

131
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,460
All over, i guess.

132
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:05,880
And they some of them, all of them, 
are programmed with specific missions.

133
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,650
The one at the safe house was sent there for those fighters.

134
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,610
Skynet doesn't know you're here.

135
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,860
There's no directive to hunt you.

136
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:15,540
So if i was to walk right by one...

137
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,350
They'll walk right by you.

138
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,200
They don't know what you look like.

139
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,850
That's really awesome.

140
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:26,210
And what if they found out who he was?

141
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,400
Would they all know what to do then?

142
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,270
They do.

143
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,630
Awesome.

144
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,040
So school registration is at 3:00 tomorrow.

145
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:40,650
Do you think we can have all this sorted out by then?

146
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,540
Can't you just be happy being yourself for a little while longer?

147
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,120
Just sit still?

148
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,760
It's not so bad being a connor.

149
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,490
That's easy for you to say.

150
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:51,870
Is it?

151
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,100
You all put back together, tin man?

152
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,310
Tin man?

153
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,720
You ready to go?

154
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,920
Thank you for explaining.

155
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,120
You stay here.

156
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,560
Still like a statute.

157
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:24,400
Enrique?

158
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,610
Statue.

159
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,570
Yeah, i've been a statue for the lasthree days.

160
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:29,900
We'll be back.

161
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:44,420
I did paramilitary training with enrique outside of oaxaca.

162
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,970
He taught john to shoot rifles.

163
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:48,700
So what you said before.

164
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,560
Is that why we're really here?

165
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:55,150
Did john, the future john, 
did he send you back to help me jump over my death?

166
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,990
Is everything else a lie?

167
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,150
No.

168
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,970
He sent us here to fight.

169
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,620
You're the best fighter he knows.

170
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,880
I'm sure that's not-- the best.

171
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:10,930
So if i'm such a great fighter, how was i killed?

172
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,540
Cancer.

173
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,420
We're here.

174
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,460
Hey, it's john.

175
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:27,480
I'm not here right now.

176
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,940
You know what to do.

177
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:33,020
Hey, sorry i misd you, but leave a message 
and i'll call you back...

178
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,230
Probably.

179
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,890
You've reached the future leader of mankind.

180
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:42,710
It may take me a little while to get back to you, 
but leave a message anyway.

181
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,480
818-555-0147.

182
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,750
Leave a message.

183
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:54,710
Statue.

184
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,170
Screw it.

185
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,540
I'm not surprised.

186
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:08,310
I know i looked surprised 
when i saw you in that first moment.

187
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:12,000
But i am not surprised.

188
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,650
Do you know this woman well?

189
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:17,960
It's rhetorical.

190
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,290
If you don't, you don't.

191
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:24,480
But if you do, an you're anything like her, 
you'll lie and say you don't.

192
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:30,960
But if you do, then i know that you, 
like me, are not surprised.

193
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,170
And john.

194
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,620
He's a man now.

195
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,880
He's grown up.

196
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,890
He misses you.

197
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,620
I need three sets of papers.

198
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,860
I can pay.

199
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,340
Not a lot, but some.

200
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,490
Why not?

201
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,400
I'm finished with that life.

202
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,470
What?

203
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:54,490
Are you familiar with ricardo lopez?

204
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,930
The boxer from cuernavaca.

205
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,710
He is very famous in my country.

206
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:03,620
His nickname is el finito.

207
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,550
Finisher.

208
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,690
Yes.

209
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,260
He fought 52 fights.

210
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,760
51 victories, one draw.

211
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,970
And no losses, zero.

212
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,410
I don't understand.

213
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,540
I wanted to be el finito.

214
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:18,020
To retire undefeated.

215
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,740
I lived my wild life.

216
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:22,790
I fought the wars i wanted to.

217
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,710
And a few i did not.

218
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:28,840
But i lived every day free.

219
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,640
Not one day behind bars.

220
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,970
Nor in the hands of the enemy.

221
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,440
So now i am finished.

222
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,660
El finito.

223
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,640
Happy for you.

224
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,580
Sorry for me, but happy for you.

225
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:47,320
Hey, don't give up so easy!

226
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,880
I did not say i can't help.

227
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:59,560
My nephew, carlos, has, how we say, 
taken over the family business.

228
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:01,710
His operation is very good.

229
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:05,320
But he is not a believer.

230
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:08,110
Few believers left, i think.

231
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,210
You're a very quiet girl.

232
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,480
Hey, are you there?

233
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,700
who's charlie dixon?

234
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,620
You shouldn't surf with the demo.

235
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,370
People get in your business.

236
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,600
Clear your history too.

237
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:07,170
My history?

238
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,570
Your history of what you've been looking at.

239
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,540
Snoopy people, dude.

240
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,830
Snoopy people all over.

241
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,180
Got a special on those.

242
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,340
, no, maybe later.

243
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,580
Thanks.

244
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,320
Carlos?

245
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,710
Enrique sent us.

246
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,640
What the hell?

247
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,710
Pipe their crazy asses down.

248
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,270
Wait at the car.

249
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,330
Something about your friend i should know?

250
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,560
Cat person.

251
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:19,730
Heh.

252
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,810
Want a soda or something?

253
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:22,770
I'm good.

254
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,640
We got the old-fashioned soda machine.

255
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,050
Little bottles.

256
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,470
It's a collectible now.

257
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:31,530
Jose!

258
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,130
Soda, por favor.

259
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:29,020
* * my uncle, he's very good at keeping secrets.

260
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:33,190
When i was young, i'd see him at family barbecues, 
and i'd try to get him to tell me his secrets.

261
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,440
How did that work out for you?

262
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,640
Not so good.

263
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:41,310
Except one day, about eight years ago, 
i find him in the kitchen.

264
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,330
A bottle of patron and the times.

265
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,490
You know whose picture's on the front page?

266
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,320
Only time i ever see my uncle cry.

267
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,130
He's a good man.

268
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:57,510
Not for me to say, but he's my uncle.

269
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,830
And you're as close as i'm gonna get to one of his secrets.

270
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,720
So i'm gonna give you what you need.

271
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,190
Thank you.

272
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,820
20000

273
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,530
What?

274
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:11,790
I don't have that.

275
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:13,070
20000

276
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,500
That's a family discount in these hard times.

277
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:18,660
Especially for someone who's been dead eight years.

278
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:19,940
That's extortion.

279
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,740
War on terrorism makes this the front lines, lady.

280
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:26,100
Some raghead gets fake papers down here, 
we're all going to guantanamo.

281
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,830
9/11 doubled prices overnight.

282
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,420
9/11.What's that?

283
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,550
Hey, baby girl.

284
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,520
What did i tell you about hanging around?

285
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:52,390
Who's your new friend here?

286
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:54,240
She someone i need to know?

287
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,070
'Cause the longer you stand around, 
the more i think she's someone i need to know.

288
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:06,850
You got a name?

289
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:08,270
Um, no.

290
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,660
Hmm.

291
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,490
This your car?

292
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,800
No.

293
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,060
It's definitely not my car.

294
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:20,450
See, i know just about everyone in this neighborhood, 
and you are not one of those everyone.

295
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:24,290
So now you got me wondering not just who you are that you won't say,
 but why you're here.

296
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,970
And that you won't s.

297
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:33,000
You know, it's not uncommon in these neighborhoods for a gang 
dealing in drugs to store their drugs inside of a stolen car.

298
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:37,650
That way no drugs can be found on their property or 
on any property belonging to them.

299
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:44,480
But they also like to leave a lookout, 
sometimes a pretty girl, to watch their stash.

300
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:48,020
Now you don't mind if i call this license plate in, do you?

301
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,420
Jenny!

302
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:56,810
Jejennif!

303
00:22:56,930 --> 00:23:00,420
How many times have i told you to stop seeing that little punk ass?

304
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:01,520
I swear to god.

305
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:02,270
Is he meeting you here?

306
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:02,770
Ma'am?

307
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,570
Is he meeting you here?

308
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:04,870
Ma'am!

309
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:05,920
You know this girl?

310
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,460
Yes, i know this girl.

311
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,630
Do i have any choice but to know you, 
you spoiled little bitch?

312
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,150
Do you do domestic complaints officer?

313
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:20,520
Can i make a domestic complaint against my spoiled little stepdaughter 
for making me want to beat my own brains in?

314
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,430
It's her real mother's fault.

315
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:24,170
Can i tell you what she lets her do?

316
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:25,270
Ma'am, is this your car?

317
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,110
Why would i drive that piece of crap?

318
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:30,010
'Cause i will send you back to private school.

319
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,300
The one with the uniforms.

320
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,050
They will dress you like a flannel sock.

321
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:36,600
Ma'am, maybe you guys can have this conversation somewhere else, 
like at home perhaps?

322
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,860
Out of gang territory.

323
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,080
Gang territory?

324
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,130
Of course.

325
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,420
Thank you, officer.

326
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,880
Come on.

327
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,960
It's 13 miles to walk home.

328
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,590
We need another car.

329
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,990
Were you gonna kill that cop?

330
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:55,890
Don't answer that.

331
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:57,460
Don't want to know.

332
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:00,030
We need rules.

333
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:02,550
Aren't you supposed to take orders or something like that?

334
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,190
I do.

335
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:03,820
From john.

336
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,570
From john.

337
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,770
So if i tell john to forbid you-- not this john.

338
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:08,040
Not this john.

339
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,140
Aren't they the same?

340
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,450
Not yet.

341
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,790
I cannot imagine the apocalypse.

342
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:25,900
No matter what kyle reece told me, or others who have come back.

343
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:29,900
I cannot imagine 3 billion dead.

344
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:35,280
I can imagine planes hitting buildings, 
and i can imagine fire.

345
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:39,420
If i would've witnessed it, 
if i would've been here, 

346
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:42,570
i'm sure i would've thought the end was near.

347
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:45,260
I'm sure i would've thought...

348
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,460
We have failed.

349
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,760
John?

350
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,460
Johnny?

351
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,970
Is it really you?

352
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,790
It is you.

353
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:34,440
I--i saw a picture of your mother on the television 

354
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,090
and i could barely believe my-- 

355
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,980
i can't believe this.

356
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,390
Don't come any closer.

357
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:44,570
Stop.

358
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,710
You came to my house.

359
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,540
You married?

360
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,150
Yeah, i am.

361
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:57,260
She's a nurse at the hospital where i work.

362
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:58,570
That's nice.

363
00:26:58,570 --> 00:26:59,790
It's good.

364
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:02,820
Johnny, what happened?

365
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,480
Stop.

366
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,230
Johnny, it's okay.

367
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:08,360
Please stop.

368
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,800
No, no, johnny.

369
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,560
It's me, johnny.

370
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:18,310
I'm sorry.

371
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,660
Hey.

372
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:29,510
How'd it go with enrique?

373
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:33,950
El finito is a true believer, 
but he is finished with the life.

374
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,510
What?

375
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:36,350
We need 20 grand.

376
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:38,310
It's a long story.

377
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:40,230
That taking you a while?

378
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,170
Yeah, it's taking me a while.

379
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:44,520
I gotta, you know, strip wires and...

380
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:10,880
John has a high level of stress.

381
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,010
Genetics are a bitch.

382
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:15,130
I did a brief analysis.

383
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:16,460
Surface skin temperature high.

384
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,600
Salinity high.

385
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,900
Pulse abnormal.

386
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,880
That's 'cause the kid snuck 
out while we were gone.

387
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,000
Wouldn't look me in the eye.

388
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,350
His shoes are wet with grass.

389
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:27,090
Don't need to be a tin man to figure that one out.

390
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:29,860
Just a mom.

391
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,780
Where did he go?

392
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,510
Worry about that later.

393
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:36,290
Just need to make sure he doesn't do it again.

394
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:38,180
I didn't know that was something you could do.

395
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,810
The skin trick.

396
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:42,300
I should know about your skills or whatever.

397
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:45,490
Like can you analyze blood?

398
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:46,580
Can you scan someone?

399
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:49,340
You mean computed axial tomography?

400
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,120
Cat scans?

401
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,660
Yeah.

402
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:54,180
That.Can you do that?

403
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:57,650
No.

404
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:05,470
Get your shoes on.

405
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:10,730
Do you want your new name or what?

406
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,940
You sure there's money here?

407
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:34,330
Money, guns, anything they valued.

408
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:36,420
It will be hidden.

409
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:39,060
It's always hidden.

410
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:42,930
Yeah, well, whatever they had, 
les hope the cops didn't get to it first.

411
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:45,340
Let's hope our metal friend didn't find it.

412
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:49,120
Our metal friend was only here to kill 
that fourth fighter when he came home.

413
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,820
Nice to know we spoiled that.

414
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:54,100
It'll find him.

415
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,160
That's ridiculous.

416
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,780
People do like small animals.

417
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,070
Yeah, but...

418
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,350
I don't know how to explain this.

419
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:18,000
Some badass soldier is not gonna 
have a kitty poster on the wall.

420
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:28,570
Mom.

421
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:36,770
Do what you do, girly.

422
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:41,600
What?

423
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,950
They rigged it.

424
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,730
What did she say?

425
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:57,510
120 seconds before the system reboots?

426
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,520
We gotta get in there, john.

427
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,310
We can't come back.

428
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,720
Mom, we'll find the money some other way.

429
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:06,650
No, whatever's in there, i want it now.

430
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,150
Numbers.

431
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:17,250
What are the numbers?
What can the numbers be?

432
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:25,570
Damn.Fingerprints.

433
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,940
It's a date.

434
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:36,960
Judgment day.

435
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:48,380
What are those?

436
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:58,280
Why are diamonds a girl's best friend?

437
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,110
What?

438
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:05,150
Why are diamonds a girl's best friend?

439
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,360
Where'd you get that?

440
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,040
John gave it to me.

441
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,510
He did, did he?

442
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:13,230
That was sweet of him.

443
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:15,710
We have a whole bag of them.Do you want one?

444
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:17,400
They're a girl's best friend.

445
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,180
Not this girl.

446
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:22,020
I know what the tin man is.

447
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:24,400
He needed a heart.

448
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,580
The wonderful wizard of oz, written by l.
Frank baum in 1900.First published in

449
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:32,860
-- i know all about the wizard of oz.

450
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,500
When john was little, i-- 

451
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:40,980
you read it to him over and over again in spanish.

452
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:48,080
He never told you, but it was one 
of his favorite things that you did.

453
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:54,690
He used to talk about it a lot.

454
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,280
Okay, shoppers.

455
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,040
49

456
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:08,240
98 for this dvd/cd player with remote...

457
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:18,930
Hey, who-- who the hell are you?

458
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:20,850
What are you doing here, man?

459
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:25,970
This is my house, man.

460
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:27,590
"chet.

461
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:29,490
" what's with thtrespassing?

462
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:31,260
And the visor...

463
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:34,210
Chet?

464
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:44,840
Oh, chet-- aah!

465
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:57,830
they're exactly like you asked.

466
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:58,920
These ain't just forgeries.

467
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,230
This is full service.

468
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:02,250
You're in the system and everything.

469
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:04,170
Collect welfare with 'em if you want.

470
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:09,130
We might have to.

471
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:12,510
Didn't take you long to round that up, 
so i'm feeling the price was right.

472
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:16,560
Maybe you'd have gone another ten gs.

473
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,470
Uncle enrique will be proud.

474
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:21,960
So i miss the next family barbecue.

475
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,650
Charlie...

476
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:37,560
You okay?

477
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:41,880
You've been a little, you know, 
out of it all night.

478
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,980
No, i'm good.

479
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:47,130
I'm fine.I just-- i had a rough call.

480
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:49,940
Some guy on meth.

481
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,760
God, babe, want me to take a look at that?

482
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,870
No, no, i'm good.I'm goo.

483
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:57,610
-You sure?
-Yeah.

484
00:35:57,610 --> 00:35:59,520
Love you.

485
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:05,050
Yeah, i love you too.

486
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,400
Carlos was right.

487
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,610
$20,000 wasn't that much money.

488
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:22,820
A new identity, a new life, a chance.

489
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,640
You can't put a price on that.

490
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,910
But unlike jn,n, i was never 
eager for that new life to begin.

491
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:30,780
I liked having no name, no story.

492
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:33,740
It was the only time i got to be me.

493
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:37,210
Unfortunately, sometimes you have to pay for that.

494
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:43,350
And the price was getting higher every day.

495
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:56,220
Sarah.

496
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:59,740
You can either drinitit od mp it.

497
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:03,470
I say drink it.

498
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:05,480
Anything i should know?

499
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,370
Excuse me?

500
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:07,980
Anything i should know?

501
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:10,000
Anything you forgot to tell me?

502
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,930
Neglected.

503
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:11,900
Lied about.

504
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,240
First and last chance.

505
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,230
I don't know what you're talking about.

506
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,710
Please...

507
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,670
Put the gun down and explain.

508
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,710
El finito.

509
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,470
El finito.Yes, what about it?

510
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:22,650
Not a day behind bars.

511
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:23,810
Lived a life of freedom.

512
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:24,920
Yes!

513
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,640
That's not what carlos said.

514
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:33,500
[speaking spanis my nephew is a thief and a liar.

515
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,150
I told you-- he was speaking spanish to his crew.

516
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:39,500
He referred to you as a rata.

517
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,020
Slang for "snitch," isn't it?

518
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,030
You must have heard him wrong.

519
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,010
A rata.

520
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,240
Rat.

521
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,050
Denunciente.

522
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:47,480
Informer.

523
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:51,410
Certain words i know and don't forget.

524
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:53,610
Are you selling people out?

525
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:56,810
Are you selling me out, enrique?

526
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:58,810
Okay.

527
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:01,170
Okay.

528
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:04,380
I was in lompoc many years ago.

529
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,820
On a federal gun charge.

530
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:06,400
You said you never-- 

531
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,110
three weeks.Only three weeks.

532
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:10,790
And you made a deal?You talked?

533
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:13,470
No, i gave information on my cellmate.

534
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:19,000
He had kidnapped a child and put her in 
his trunk, and drove her from oregon.

535
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,350
He told me--he told me where he dumped her.

536
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:25,860
And--they dropped my charge, yes.

537
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,970
But that was all.

538
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:30,080
That was all i gave.

539
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,190
And yes, i lied to you.

540
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:42,450
But whe e i ew up, where we grew up, 
a man doesn't-- you know-- 

541
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:44,600
it's another one.

542
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,740
It means the same thing.

543
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,220
Why would you do this?

544
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,260
Did you hear what he said?

545
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:48,820
We don't know.

546
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,420
We don't know.

547
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,690
He was possibly lying.

548
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:52,460
Possibly?

549
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,770
You just executed him on possibly?

550
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:56,660
He had a family!

551
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,670
Why would you do this?

552
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:04,650
Because you wouldn't.

553
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:07,120
How do you know what i would and would not do?

554
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,410
You don't know me.

555
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:09,800
You don't know me!

556
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,380
And you don't know my son.

557
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:14,290
Not john.

558
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:17,390
Not my john.

559
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:20,820
You don't know what i would and wouldn't do.

560
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:27,580
I don't even know what i would and wouldn't do.

561
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:36,180
I wake up this morning and you tell me...

562
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:40,550
I dot k ow anything anymore.

563
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:47,900
I don't even remember what my name is.

564
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:54,480
Sarah connor.

565
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,460
So where are you from?

566
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:01,330
Lawrence, kansas, actually.
It's a pretty good size city.

567
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:02,450
About 80,000.

568
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:04,160
Go to kansas city often?

569
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,190
Well, lawrence is about 50
 miles east of kansas city.

570
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:09,050
25 miles west.

571
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:10,320
I knew that.

572
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:14,300
What about your father?

573
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,790
Your father.

574
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:17,950
Did you leave him behind in lawrence, kansas?

575
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:19,620
Your father's dead.

576
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,240
He was a police officer.

577
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,800
He died apprehending a criminal.

578
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,860
He's a hero.

579
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,330
Yeah, i know that.

580
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:29,730
My dad's always a hero.

581
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:35,670
And he's always dead.

582
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,380
Did you go out late last night?

583
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:48,130
No, why?

584
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:48,910
Motion detectors.

585
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:50,520
I thought i heard a beep.

586
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,180
Probably her.

587
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:59,650
She just walks and walks.

588
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:04,020
Look, if you want to hold me out another 
few days until these stupid stories straight

589
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,240
-- you're going to school.

590
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:05,790
But-- 

591
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:09,160
at least that way i'll know where you are.

592
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:13,570
And who you're with.

593
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:14,780
Mom.

594
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:18,880
What?

595
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:22,510
Never mind.

596
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,560
Who do you think, agent?

597
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,070
Perhaps you think i was retired, yes?

598
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:33,630
That i did not have my ear to the street?

599
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:37,620
If you return my call, i believe i may 
have something of interest for you.

600
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:41,160
Muy expensivo, but of great interest.

601
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:46,680
El finito will not disappoint.

602
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,690
Know thyself.

603
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:02,670
John once told me it's inscribed on 
the front of the temple of apollo.

604
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,860
Then entire quote is, "know thyself "

605
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:09,050
and thou shall know all the mysteries 
of the gods and of the universe.

606
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:11,120
" that's quite a mouthful.

607
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,810
My version is this.

608
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:16,550
Know thyself because what else is there to know?

609
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:18,360
People hide secrets.

610
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,980
Time is a lie.

611
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:23,480
The material world can disappear in an instant.

612
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:29,350
It has and it will again.

613
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:36,290
The doctor will see you in a few minutes, ms.Baum.

614
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:38,160
Our identities change.

615
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,550
Our names, the way we look, how we act and speak.

616
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:45,560
We're shape shifters.

617
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,110
There is no control.

618
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:48,280
No constant.

619
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:55,920
No shelter but the love of family 
and the body god gave us.

620
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:08,470
And we can only hope that 
that will always be enough.
