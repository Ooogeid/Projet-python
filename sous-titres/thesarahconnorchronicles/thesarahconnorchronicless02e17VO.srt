1
00:00:08,515 --> 00:00:10,092
You shouldn't nest in the chimney.

2
00:00:17,181 --> 00:00:19,685
You're migratory.
You need to find a mate.

3
00:00:26,374 --> 00:00:27,526
That's a window, bird.

4
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:41,040
What am I going to do with you?

5
00:00:46,758 --> 00:00:49,158
A bird in a chimney
is a fire hazard.

6
00:00:49,906 --> 00:00:51,856
I'm not supposed to kill you,

7
00:00:53,518 --> 00:00:55,218
but you can't stay here.

8
00:00:59,686 --> 00:01:00,519
Go.

9
00:01:51,942 --> 00:01:53,778
I was wondering
when we'd see you again.

10
00:01:56,029 --> 00:01:57,616
They make you rest a couple days.

11
00:01:59,456 --> 00:02:00,606
Does it help?

12
00:02:01,437 --> 00:02:02,487
Not really.

13
00:02:13,418 --> 00:02:14,966
Is there any more somewhere?

14
00:02:16,981 --> 00:02:18,471
Downstairs under the sink.

15
00:02:36,113 --> 00:02:38,063
I just needed a minute alone.

16
00:02:38,376 --> 00:02:39,376
Sorry.

17
00:02:43,765 --> 00:02:45,094
She say something?

18
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:48,429
She asked me about it.

19
00:02:49,174 --> 00:02:50,674
To be nice, I think.

20
00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:54,959
Well, it's nobody's business.

21
00:02:55,343 --> 00:02:57,793
Well, it shouldn't
have happened here.

22
00:02:58,286 --> 00:03:00,080
Or not at all.

23
00:03:04,427 --> 00:03:05,730
It's in the past.

24
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,354
People don't forget about the past.

25
00:03:15,976 --> 00:03:17,826
I'm not saying "forget it".

26
00:03:19,822 --> 00:03:20,866
I'm saying

27
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:23,588
it's in the past.

28
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,998
- Sight's off.
- Gimme.

29
00:04:13,762 --> 00:04:15,796
It's nice being able
to waste bullets on apples.

30
00:04:16,373 --> 00:04:19,073
Yeah. It's nice being able
to waste apples.

31
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:21,719
April 21st, 2011.

32
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:27,959
I never asked you for Judgment Day.

33
00:04:28,662 --> 00:04:30,258
Your Judgment Day.

34
00:04:37,822 --> 00:04:39,772
You're right about the sight.

35
00:04:41,793 --> 00:04:43,958
April 21st, 2011. That's mine.

36
00:04:44,568 --> 00:04:45,718
What's yours?

37
00:04:46,408 --> 00:04:49,108
Whenever mine is,
it might not be any more.

38
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:52,833
So, don't forget about it, love.
We'll know it when it happens.

39
00:04:55,615 --> 00:04:57,565
I want you to help me
with something.

40
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:00,896
Didn't I just help with something
this morning in the shower?

41
00:05:05,065 --> 00:05:07,890
There's a guy.
He's got some information I need.

42
00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:11,469
- So, ask him.
- Not that kind of guy.

43
00:05:12,435 --> 00:05:14,104
Not that kind of information.

44
00:05:21,731 --> 00:05:24,177
I'm not here
to stop the war, sweetie.

45
00:05:24,815 --> 00:05:26,075
I'm here to win it.

46
00:05:32,247 --> 00:05:33,797
You keep saying that.

47
00:05:35,223 --> 00:05:37,323
But, I don't know what it means.

48
00:05:37,716 --> 00:05:39,046
I'm the one living with him.

49
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:42,457
How's that working out for you?

50
00:05:42,582 --> 00:05:45,895
Is the metal alive and well?
Sarah running you around?

51
00:05:48,533 --> 00:05:49,533
I'm here.

52
00:05:50,824 --> 00:05:51,976
I'm asking you.

53
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,312
Either help me with my plan

54
00:05:55,679 --> 00:05:57,879
or show me some progress on yours.

55
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,500
Okay. What do you need?

56
00:06:25,238 --> 00:06:27,802
There was a stack of research here
on that lawyer.

57
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,446
The one who set up
the drone shell company.

58
00:06:30,571 --> 00:06:31,970
Derek took it.

59
00:06:32,209 --> 00:06:34,259
- When?
- While you were gone.

60
00:06:34,425 --> 00:06:36,547
So, he's chasing it down?

61
00:06:37,124 --> 00:06:39,481
- I don't know.
- He should keep me in the loop.

62
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:40,799
It's my loop.

63
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:43,986
You've been distracted.

64
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:46,155
I was kidnapped.

65
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,240
Which is distracting.

66
00:06:52,303 --> 00:06:53,953
Talk to me about Riley.

67
00:06:54,476 --> 00:06:56,520
What happened the day
she tried to kill herself?

68
00:06:56,645 --> 00:06:59,082
She was very upset.
John could tell.

69
00:06:59,523 --> 00:07:01,987
- She had a bruise on her face.
- Who gave her the bruise?

70
00:07:02,112 --> 00:07:04,715
John thought it was her foster dad.
She said it was a door.

71
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:06,183
Liar. Then what?

72
00:07:06,423 --> 00:07:09,011
Riley cut her wrists like this.

73
00:07:10,778 --> 00:07:12,674
She almost bled to death.

74
00:07:13,829 --> 00:07:17,229
- Do you think it was her foster dad?
- It's hard to say.

75
00:07:18,306 --> 00:07:20,356
We don't know much about Riley.

76
00:07:20,616 --> 00:07:21,904
We should know more.

77
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:24,651
I know where she lives.
I'll go talk to her foster parents.

78
00:07:25,251 --> 00:07:27,166
I'll go. My loop.

Subtitles: Projet-SG

81
00:09:14,542 --> 00:09:15,842
I killed a bird.

82
00:09:18,133 --> 00:09:19,983
Not the one in the chimney.

83
00:09:20,387 --> 00:09:22,187
I thought you should know.

84
00:09:23,669 --> 00:09:24,938
A bird did that?

85
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,065
No. I did that. Look.

86
00:09:30,223 --> 00:09:33,030
The bird experienced
an involuntary movement of my fingers.

87
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:37,092
It was fragile.

88
00:09:39,237 --> 00:09:40,495
Wiggle your fingers.

89
00:09:46,528 --> 00:09:49,671
Yeah, there's damage,
but it's buried pretty deep in there.

90
00:09:50,085 --> 00:09:51,757
I don't know how it happened.

91
00:09:52,066 --> 00:09:53,678
It was probably during a fight.

92
00:09:53,803 --> 00:09:56,300
You're not designed
to fight other machines.

93
00:10:00,781 --> 00:10:02,256
Maybe I could swap this out.

94
00:10:02,381 --> 00:10:05,129
But it's not like we just have
spare parts lying around.

95
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:38,559
- You're supposed to burn the endos.
- Not all of them.

96
00:10:39,017 --> 00:10:40,013
Says who?

97
00:10:40,412 --> 00:10:41,139
You.

98
00:10:42,307 --> 00:10:43,285
What, future me?

99
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:45,477
Future you.

100
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,100
Yeah, why doesn't that surprise me?

101
00:10:50,698 --> 00:10:53,971
I have damage to my hand
and now you're able to fix it.

102
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:10,627
Future John has better
information than you do.

103
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,344
- She's gonna kill me.
- What? Who?

104
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,084
Her. Cameron.

105
00:11:33,358 --> 00:11:36,361
- What happened? What did it do?
- I saw something. The metal.

106
00:11:36,955 --> 00:11:39,424
- The metal.
- She cut her wrists.

107
00:11:40,715 --> 00:11:42,962
- Why did it cut itself?
- I don't know.

108
00:11:43,087 --> 00:11:45,283
But I saw the metal.
And she knows that I saw it.

109
00:11:45,408 --> 00:11:48,651
Sweetie, if she knew you saw,
you'd be dead.

110
00:11:55,722 --> 00:11:59,131
- I can't go back there.
- I wonder what's wrong with it.

111
00:11:59,505 --> 00:12:01,511
- Has it been acting strange?
- Strange?

112
00:12:01,949 --> 00:12:03,680
Everything she does is strange.

113
00:12:04,652 --> 00:12:07,042
Did you not hear me?
I can't go back there.

114
00:12:07,167 --> 00:12:08,435
Course you can, dear.

115
00:12:08,967 --> 00:12:11,353
You put one foot
in front of the other.

116
00:12:11,478 --> 00:12:12,872
Master your fear.

117
00:12:13,268 --> 00:12:15,025
Remember the mission.

118
00:12:21,026 --> 00:12:24,592
- There's gotta be another way.
- Trust me. There is only one way.

119
00:12:26,928 --> 00:12:28,330
I won't let Cameron hurt you.

120
00:12:32,982 --> 00:12:34,628
I won't let anyone hurt you.

121
00:12:39,846 --> 00:12:41,342
Here's one from my private stash.

122
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,720
Kay doesn't buy the kind
with sugar or caffeine

123
00:12:44,025 --> 00:12:45,389
but what's the point?

124
00:12:46,204 --> 00:12:47,340
I hear you.

125
00:12:49,968 --> 00:12:52,813
Must've been a shock,
what happened to Riley.

126
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:55,641
What's John say?

127
00:12:56,599 --> 00:12:58,777
Getting anything out of that boy
is like pulling teeth.

128
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,050
But he did say
that she seemed upset that day

129
00:13:04,175 --> 00:13:06,493
and she had a bruise on her face.

130
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:07,765
Bruise?

131
00:13:09,296 --> 00:13:10,958
I'm a patient person,

132
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,999
but I swear,
there have been times...

133
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,336
Kids. They know
how to push your buttons.

134
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,696
Just saying if someone
was to lose their temper...

135
00:13:21,821 --> 00:13:24,689
- Get physical...
- If by someone, you mean me...

136
00:13:24,814 --> 00:13:26,377
These things do happen.

137
00:13:26,502 --> 00:13:29,391
These things do happen.
But not the way you're thinking.

138
00:13:29,918 --> 00:13:31,653
Not by a long shot.

139
00:13:31,857 --> 00:13:34,402
That girl assaulted my wife.

140
00:13:34,527 --> 00:13:35,953
Went absolutely nuts.

141
00:13:36,812 --> 00:13:39,092
Started yelling
about the world burning up

142
00:13:39,217 --> 00:13:42,320
and bleached skulls
or some such nonsense.

143
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:45,500
She said that?

144
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:48,535
I wanted to report it.
Kay wouldn't let me.

145
00:13:49,257 --> 00:13:51,538
But now I wish I had with you
coming around here accusing us.

146
00:13:51,948 --> 00:13:53,539
I'm not accusing anybody.

147
00:13:55,311 --> 00:13:58,094
First your kid drops out of school,
then so does she.

148
00:13:58,219 --> 00:14:00,898
Next thing you know,
we got a guidance counselor at our door.

149
00:14:01,023 --> 00:14:02,798
Even she thinks
John's a bad influence.

150
00:14:02,923 --> 00:14:04,050
A guidance counselor.

151
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,095
She had a lot to say
about you and your family.

152
00:14:07,711 --> 00:14:09,389
I was willing to dismiss it
as gossip...

153
00:14:10,176 --> 00:14:11,558
Until I met you.

154
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,312
Do you have her name?

155
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,479
Keep John away from Riley.

156
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,186
She's been through enough.

157
00:14:49,033 --> 00:14:50,737
Okay, clench your fist.

158
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,268
And, okay, now, fingers straight.

159
00:15:03,749 --> 00:15:05,301
You feel any different?

160
00:15:06,396 --> 00:15:07,396
Yes.

161
00:15:09,387 --> 00:15:10,739
Are you all fixed?

162
00:15:12,318 --> 00:15:13,212
I don't know.

163
00:15:17,934 --> 00:15:19,918
Just try not to kill any more birds.

164
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,133
You're ahead of schedule.

165
00:15:25,489 --> 00:15:26,489
With what?

166
00:15:28,025 --> 00:15:29,219
What you need to learn.

167
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:35,899
I know it's just recon, Derek,

168
00:15:36,024 --> 00:15:38,418
but I can't have you
running off like that.

169
00:15:39,034 --> 00:15:40,125
I gotta go.

170
00:15:42,133 --> 00:15:44,109
- Miss Wilson, thanks for coming.
- Ms. Baum.

171
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:50,042
So your family's moved
around a lot, I take it.

172
00:15:51,311 --> 00:15:53,096
Unfortunately, my job requires it.

173
00:15:53,221 --> 00:15:55,575
It's been difficult on John.
Hard for him to make friends.

174
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,647
I can imagine.

175
00:15:56,772 --> 00:15:59,695
That's why I was so happy when Riley
first came home with him.

176
00:16:00,869 --> 00:16:02,639
I didn't realize
she was so troubled.

177
00:16:02,764 --> 00:16:04,629
Foster kids like these,
it's hard to tell.

178
00:16:05,022 --> 00:16:07,632
A lot of them come
from broken homes, abuse.

179
00:16:08,644 --> 00:16:10,219
Where does she come from?

180
00:16:10,398 --> 00:16:12,406
An orphan out of Riverside.

181
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:15,432
Her parents died in a fire
in a meth lab. It's tragic.

182
00:16:16,487 --> 00:16:19,603
I met her foster dad.
He said you talked to him about us.

183
00:16:20,135 --> 00:16:22,272
I was curious about
why it happened in your home.

184
00:16:22,872 --> 00:16:24,160
In your bathroom.

185
00:16:25,573 --> 00:16:26,740
I have no idea.

186
00:16:27,338 --> 00:16:29,090
My main concern
is that the girl get help.

187
00:16:29,215 --> 00:16:30,030
Of course.

188
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:33,546
I've only known her a short while,
but I've grown fond of her.

189
00:16:35,343 --> 00:16:38,180
- Funny, she thinks you don't like her.
- It's not the case.

190
00:16:39,103 --> 00:16:42,125
So you're the one who took her
to the hospital afterwards?

191
00:16:43,179 --> 00:16:44,419
No. I was out of town.

192
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:49,090
So there was no adult supervision
in the household at the time.

193
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,468
John's uncle stays with us
sometimes.

194
00:16:52,351 --> 00:16:54,554
Yeah, Riley's mentioned the uncle.
Uncle Derek.

195
00:16:56,528 --> 00:16:58,592
John's uncle on his father's side.

196
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:01,394
We're not involved
if that's what you're getting at.

197
00:17:01,782 --> 00:17:04,439
Not getting at anything.
Just trying to paint a picture.

198
00:17:06,835 --> 00:17:09,325
Do you think it's wise
to have an unattached,

199
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:12,285
adult male hanging around
a pretty, teenage girl

200
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:14,240
who's obviously
so desperate for attention?

201
00:17:15,805 --> 00:17:17,604
What, did she say
something about him?

202
00:17:17,729 --> 00:17:20,121
She might have.
If she did, it's confidential.

203
00:17:21,469 --> 00:17:23,249
Miss Wilson, look,
John's a good kid.

204
00:17:24,171 --> 00:17:27,093
Whatever's going on with this girl,
he's trying to be her friend.

205
00:17:27,218 --> 00:17:28,418
He's trying to help her.

206
00:17:29,234 --> 00:17:30,590
Like by taking her to Mexico?

207
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:34,790
Mexico?

208
00:17:35,151 --> 00:17:37,472
Riley said she and John
took a trip to Mexico.

209
00:17:38,301 --> 00:17:40,896
Now, I don't have to tell you
that transporting a minor

210
00:17:41,021 --> 00:17:43,978
across the border without her parents'
permission is a federal offense.

211
00:17:47,677 --> 00:17:50,965
I didn't know.
Obviously, I will talk to my son.

212
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:56,032
Miss Baum, I'm not out
to get anyone here.

213
00:17:56,363 --> 00:17:59,606
My sense is that you're a decent person,
a hardworking mom.

214
00:18:01,008 --> 00:18:03,666
I'm a big believer in keeping
your own house in order.

215
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,503
So why don't I let you handle
this your way...

216
00:18:08,351 --> 00:18:09,337
For now.

217
00:18:10,311 --> 00:18:11,781
I'd appreciate that.

218
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,408
Consider it done.

219
00:18:33,998 --> 00:18:35,785
Keep taking the antibiotics.

220
00:18:37,308 --> 00:18:38,277
That's it?

221
00:18:38,402 --> 00:18:40,732
Why? Is there something else
you need, sweetie?

222
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:47,246
- No.
- 'Cause we really could use the room.

223
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,042
What are you doing?

224
00:19:01,532 --> 00:19:03,600
I'm looking up a restaurant address.

225
00:19:04,994 --> 00:19:06,266
Are you hungry?

226
00:19:07,782 --> 00:19:10,411
Yeah. But this is actually
for Derek.

227
00:19:10,536 --> 00:19:12,403
That Kaliba lawyer
he's been tracking,

228
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:14,235
the guy's got a booth
reserved there.

229
00:19:14,746 --> 00:19:17,656
Not an ideal location for Derek
to acquire his target.

230
00:19:18,084 --> 00:19:21,367
It's underground, and according to this,
crowded with friendly people.

231
00:19:21,776 --> 00:19:23,476
Hard to dispose of the body.

232
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,050
I don't think
that's gonna be necessary.

233
00:19:31,116 --> 00:19:32,873
Derek's just gonna
follow him and grab him

234
00:19:32,998 --> 00:19:34,536
and press him about Kaliba.

235
00:19:34,661 --> 00:19:36,792
To see if it's connected to Skynet?

236
00:19:36,917 --> 00:19:39,469
- Exactly.
- It's going to be necessary.

237
00:19:39,715 --> 00:19:42,305
- I'll make you a sandwich.
- Wait. Why?

238
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,696
You're hungry.

239
00:19:47,027 --> 00:19:49,187
Why don't we let hungry
be my problem?

240
00:19:49,577 --> 00:19:51,189
Sometimes it's nice to have help.

241
00:19:54,341 --> 00:19:55,523
How's the hand?

242
00:19:58,099 --> 00:19:59,251
Not a problem.

243
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:03,066
Aren't you supposed to be really good
at self-repair?

244
00:20:07,347 --> 00:20:09,415
But sometimes it's nice
to have help.

245
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:15,951
Well, I'll make my own sandwich.

246
00:20:36,551 --> 00:20:37,801
This one taken?

247
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,620
You buying?

248
00:20:53,503 --> 00:20:56,285
I could introduce you to Davy.

249
00:21:02,348 --> 00:21:03,948
I'm here for business,

250
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:05,722
not pleasure, thanks.

251
00:21:07,407 --> 00:21:08,457
My mistake.

252
00:21:15,347 --> 00:21:16,666
That one, huh?

253
00:21:18,284 --> 00:21:19,784
What's he do anyway?

254
00:21:22,157 --> 00:21:23,157
Lawyer.

255
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,620
He ever buy you a drink?

256
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:31,205
Once or twice.

257
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:34,336
How'd the muscle feel about that?

258
00:21:34,998 --> 00:21:36,998
They very much enjoy the show.

259
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,198
It's nice having an audience.

260
00:22:00,249 --> 00:22:02,487
So you're coming over later, right?

261
00:22:03,941 --> 00:22:06,044
Just watch a movie or something.

262
00:22:08,312 --> 00:22:10,012
Okay, I'll see you soon.

263
00:22:17,109 --> 00:22:20,588
I just had an interesting conversation
with a counselor from your old school.

264
00:22:22,158 --> 00:22:24,801
I forgot to send in
the quarterly home schooling thing.

265
00:22:25,617 --> 00:22:27,510
Actualy, that didn't come up.

266
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:29,847
The main topic of conversation
was Riley.

267
00:22:31,487 --> 00:22:32,737
What about her?

268
00:22:33,112 --> 00:22:34,310
She has a lot to say.

269
00:22:34,749 --> 00:22:37,299
About you and me, and Derek.

270
00:22:37,781 --> 00:22:38,773
And Mexico.

271
00:22:39,873 --> 00:22:42,360
- A school counselor told you this?
- All those things.

272
00:22:43,351 --> 00:22:46,000
From a stranger's lips
to my own ears, John.

273
00:22:47,788 --> 00:22:49,809
No, that doesn't make any sense.

274
00:22:49,934 --> 00:22:52,309
And I talked to her foster dad.

275
00:22:52,434 --> 00:22:55,581
I would've talked to him longer,
but he asked me to leave.

276
00:22:58,557 --> 00:23:01,757
He thinks we're the reason
she tried to kill herself.

277
00:23:02,498 --> 00:23:03,623
Because of Mexico?

278
00:23:03,748 --> 00:23:06,912
Because Riley had a violent
breakdown about bleached skulls

279
00:23:07,037 --> 00:23:08,511
and the end of the World.

280
00:23:27,951 --> 00:23:29,741
I haven't told her anything.

281
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:36,958
I don't believe you.

282
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,500
Well, I swear to God
I've said nothing.

283
00:23:50,686 --> 00:23:52,036
I'll talk to her.

284
00:23:52,884 --> 00:23:55,933
- Might be too late for that.
- Well, what do you want me to do?

285
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:59,836
To prepare for what's gonna happen
when Cameron finds out.

286
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:21,375
Do you think it's possible for me
to know something future John doesn't?

287
00:24:23,683 --> 00:24:24,921
That's hard to know.

288
00:24:26,247 --> 00:24:27,497
Seems unlikely.

289
00:24:28,434 --> 00:24:32,334
Do you think it's possible for me
to know something you don't know?

290
00:24:32,812 --> 00:24:35,389
Are you asking me
if future John kept secrets from me?

291
00:24:38,206 --> 00:24:39,506
I'm sure he did.

292
00:24:50,297 --> 00:24:51,322
Is John here?

293
00:25:00,568 --> 00:25:03,868
You owe him an explanation
for all the things you said.

294
00:25:05,225 --> 00:25:06,475
What I've said?

295
00:25:06,687 --> 00:25:08,881
To your foster dad.
To your guidance counselor.

296
00:25:09,498 --> 00:25:10,948
Guidance counselor?

297
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:13,944
You're a terrible liar.
You don't owe me.

298
00:25:14,184 --> 00:25:16,384
It's him who put his trust in you.

299
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:29,646
People know things, Riley.
True things.

300
00:25:29,771 --> 00:25:31,445
They know about Mexico.

301
00:25:31,614 --> 00:25:33,698
Why would I spill
my guts to my foster dad

302
00:25:34,002 --> 00:25:35,852
or to a guidance counselor?

303
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:39,368
I've never said anything
to anyone, I swear.

304
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:41,473
What would I even say?

305
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,045
Can we go somewhere
more private, please?

306
00:25:52,499 --> 00:25:54,349
You expecting someone else?

307
00:26:04,999 --> 00:26:06,731
Someone with a clipboard.

308
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:26,378
- May I help you?
- Hi, there. I'm Molly Malloy.

309
00:26:26,503 --> 00:26:29,754
I'm with the department
of child and family services.

310
00:26:32,001 --> 00:26:33,132
How can I help you?

311
00:26:33,301 --> 00:26:36,979
I was hoping that I could speak with you
about Riley Dawson.

312
00:26:37,376 --> 00:26:39,798
- She's not here, is she?
- No, she's not.

313
00:26:40,263 --> 00:26:41,379
Are you John?

314
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:43,476
What's this regarding?

315
00:26:43,873 --> 00:26:46,873
Would it be easier
if I came in for a quick chat?

316
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:51,875
Thank you.

317
00:27:02,561 --> 00:27:03,621
This is your fault.

318
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,625
- What's my fault?
- You're the reason that person is here.

319
00:27:11,018 --> 00:27:12,613
You're John's sister.

320
00:27:13,501 --> 00:27:15,151
You can't keep me here.

321
00:27:15,373 --> 00:27:18,073
They don't always like
the way I do things.

322
00:27:21,259 --> 00:27:23,377
I've heard you keep guns
in the home,

323
00:27:23,502 --> 00:27:26,252
which, of course,
is every American's right.

324
00:27:26,437 --> 00:27:28,678
For security. We were robbed.

325
00:27:30,853 --> 00:27:34,089
Have you ever carried a weapon
outside of the house?

326
00:27:34,751 --> 00:27:36,570
Can I ask again what this is about?

327
00:27:36,875 --> 00:27:38,619
I'm just clearing up
a few details about

328
00:27:38,744 --> 00:27:43,035
what kind of environment you've got
for kids like Riley or even John here.

329
00:27:45,124 --> 00:27:47,499
I did a little search
and couldn't find

330
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,501
a concealed weapons permit
in your name.

331
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:51,502
Check the state of new Mexico.

332
00:27:54,886 --> 00:27:57,751
Well, out of state permits
aren't valid in California.

333
00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:01,137
True, but we have 60 days to file
an ownership report with the DOJ.

334
00:28:03,728 --> 00:28:04,987
Sharp kid.

335
00:28:06,472 --> 00:28:08,572
I'll be on the lookout for that.

336
00:28:18,876 --> 00:28:20,926
What am I going to do with you?

337
00:28:24,562 --> 00:28:26,012
I don't understand.

338
00:28:27,116 --> 00:28:28,581
I don't know what you mean.

339
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:30,958
Children and family services
respond to complaints.

340
00:28:33,501 --> 00:28:34,712
Are you a complainer?

341
00:28:37,575 --> 00:28:39,425
I never told them anything.

342
00:28:40,314 --> 00:28:43,012
- What would I even tell them?
- You don't belong here.

343
00:28:43,769 --> 00:28:46,939
John isn't right for you
and you're not right for him.

344
00:28:49,312 --> 00:28:50,561
He can't see that.

345
00:28:56,065 --> 00:28:59,028
Stop. Please.
You're freaking me out.

346
00:28:59,374 --> 00:29:00,774
You're unreliable.

347
00:29:01,585 --> 00:29:03,199
I don't know what you do.

348
00:29:03,368 --> 00:29:05,218
I'm just John's girlfriend.

349
00:29:06,267 --> 00:29:07,057
That's it.

350
00:29:07,182 --> 00:29:09,862
You can't be John's girlfriend.
You're a threat.

351
00:29:10,814 --> 00:29:12,714
You can't stay here anymore.

352
00:29:14,876 --> 00:29:16,676
But I can't let you leave.

353
00:29:18,124 --> 00:29:19,674
You're John's sister.

354
00:29:21,987 --> 00:29:23,844
What am I going to do with you?

355
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:29,125
Nothing.

356
00:29:30,823 --> 00:29:32,673
You can't do anything to me

357
00:29:33,198 --> 00:29:35,098
'cause you're John's sister.

358
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:38,526
Get it through your head.
You're just his sister.

359
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,720
Riley, come with me.

360
00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:00,999
All right.

361
00:30:01,521 --> 00:30:03,521
You wanna wait outside for me?

362
00:30:15,784 --> 00:30:17,239
Were you gonna kill her?

363
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:20,234
I don't know what I was going to do.

364
00:30:20,757 --> 00:30:22,222
What do you mean{\ you didn't know
what you were gonna do}?

365
00:30:22,347 --> 00:30:24,447
Since when do you not know
what you're gonna do?

366
00:30:24,737 --> 00:30:25,887
I don't know.

367
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,701
I should've killed her.
She's a threat to you.

368
00:30:31,771 --> 00:30:34,874
That is not your decision to make.

369
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:39,420
- It's usually not a decision.
- Obviously it is this time.

370
00:30:40,514 --> 00:30:41,964
And it's not yours.

371
00:30:48,178 --> 00:30:49,722
What's happening with you?

372
00:30:51,053 --> 00:30:52,203
I don't know.

373
00:31:27,527 --> 00:31:29,227
I didn't make that call.

374
00:31:30,343 --> 00:31:31,443
I know that.

375
00:31:33,385 --> 00:31:34,985
I believe you. Really.

376
00:31:40,346 --> 00:31:42,942
Riley, is there anything
you wanna tell me?

377
00:31:45,261 --> 00:31:46,222
About what?

378
00:31:47,958 --> 00:31:49,208
About anything.

379
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:54,184
Is there anything
you want to tell me?

380
00:31:58,473 --> 00:32:00,223
Because today is the day.

381
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:05,067
Today is the day where you tell me

382
00:32:05,192 --> 00:32:07,220
whatever it is
that you might want to tell me.

383
00:32:07,345 --> 00:32:08,584
Today.

384
00:32:30,409 --> 00:32:33,009
Is there anything
that you wanna tell me?

385
00:32:35,593 --> 00:32:37,093
'Cause you're right.

386
00:32:37,884 --> 00:32:39,665
I think today is the day.

387
00:33:12,266 --> 00:33:13,366
You're late.

388
00:33:15,832 --> 00:33:17,332
Where have you been?

389
00:33:18,613 --> 00:33:21,713
I was hungry and I hate room service.
What's all this?

390
00:33:22,213 --> 00:33:24,418
Recon on our guy.

391
00:33:25,392 --> 00:33:27,332
He's got security 24/7.

392
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:28,922
Two 12 hour shifts.

393
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:30,791
Four guys total.
Armed.

394
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,267
The place he's staying at
is up in the hills.

395
00:33:33,392 --> 00:33:35,804
High walls. Lots of cameras.
Guys with guns.

396
00:33:37,001 --> 00:33:39,951
- We should take this slow.
- No. No slow.

397
00:33:40,076 --> 00:33:43,437
He's chartered a flight. We'll grab him
on the way to the airport.

398
00:33:43,704 --> 00:33:45,141
It's a moving target.

399
00:33:45,266 --> 00:33:48,666
But, you see, the roads up there
are narrow and isolated.

400
00:33:49,264 --> 00:33:51,114
I'm not sure I can do this.

401
00:33:53,969 --> 00:33:56,950
What do you mean you're not sure
you can do this? You're in.

402
00:33:57,296 --> 00:33:58,796
I'm out of practice.

403
00:34:00,005 --> 00:34:01,655
You've got your people.

404
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,816
My people seem distracted.

405
00:34:06,551 --> 00:34:07,801
What about you?

406
00:34:10,555 --> 00:34:11,957
20:30 tonight.

407
00:34:12,896 --> 00:34:14,391
Bring a vehicle to block the road.

408
00:34:14,516 --> 00:34:17,429
You pin down the guards,
I'll snatch up the lawyer.

409
00:34:31,582 --> 00:34:33,482
Look, she didn't rat us out.

410
00:34:34,636 --> 00:34:37,081
She trusted someone.
They sold her out.

411
00:34:37,832 --> 00:34:38,832
Who?

412
00:34:40,266 --> 00:34:41,871
She won't tell me who.

413
00:34:42,287 --> 00:34:43,937
This is not good, John.

414
00:34:44,354 --> 00:34:46,709
This could mean
a lot of very bad things.

415
00:35:45,885 --> 00:35:48,014
I know, Jesse. I know!

416
00:35:48,139 --> 00:35:49,283
Let go.

417
00:35:57,284 --> 00:35:59,573
- What the hell are you doing?
- What the hell are you doing?

418
00:36:00,187 --> 00:36:01,909
What are you talking about?
Calm down.

419
00:36:02,328 --> 00:36:04,695
- You wanted him to care about me.
- Of course.

420
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,110
- To like me.
- Of course.

421
00:36:06,235 --> 00:36:08,729
- Even to love me.
- Of course, sweetie.

422
00:36:09,205 --> 00:36:11,418
We talked about it 1,000 times.
That was the plan.

423
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:15,430
But that wasn't enough, right?
And you knew it wasn't enough.

424
00:36:15,763 --> 00:36:19,343
She's supposed to kill me, right?
That's it. That's the real plan.

425
00:36:19,827 --> 00:36:21,883
- That's absurd.
- No, it's not.

426
00:36:23,142 --> 00:36:25,310
You knew that was the only thing

427
00:36:25,435 --> 00:36:27,226
that would turn John against her.

428
00:36:27,893 --> 00:36:31,453
She's supposed to kill me.
You called the DCFs.

429
00:36:31,578 --> 00:36:33,023
You called my foster parents.

430
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,910
You called my school.

431
00:36:36,889 --> 00:36:38,789
How could you do that to me?

432
00:36:39,503 --> 00:36:40,703
I trusted you.

433
00:36:41,772 --> 00:36:43,222
I loved you!

434
00:36:51,434 --> 00:36:53,964
I rescued you from hell

435
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,290
and I took you to paradise!

436
00:36:58,301 --> 00:37:00,012
I gave you a purpose.

437
00:37:01,795 --> 00:37:03,395
A chance to be a hero.

438
00:37:05,763 --> 00:37:08,382
You know how few people get a chance

439
00:37:08,507 --> 00:37:10,589
for their lives to mean something?

440
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:13,395
For their deaths to mean something?

441
00:37:13,937 --> 00:37:16,330
- I made you matter.
- Stop!

442
00:37:19,166 --> 00:37:21,166
You could've been beautiful.

443
00:37:21,898 --> 00:37:23,648
But you're just a coward.

444
00:39:52,927 --> 00:39:54,277
I can't find her.

445
00:39:55,802 --> 00:39:58,020
If she's out there, she'll call you.

446
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:00,480
Eventually, she always does.

447
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:04,500
Cameron, did you...

448
00:40:08,193 --> 00:40:09,593
You know I didn't.

449
00:40:18,094 --> 00:40:21,494
What have you been doing?
You've been out here for hours.

450
00:40:21,668 --> 00:40:23,018
Making something.

451
00:40:24,056 --> 00:40:25,056
For you.

452
00:40:30,686 --> 00:40:31,636
What is it?

453
00:40:31,805 --> 00:40:33,305
You tried to fix me.

454
00:40:34,097 --> 00:40:35,223
Twice now.

455
00:40:35,722 --> 00:40:38,351
- It's not working.
- And?

456
00:40:38,883 --> 00:40:41,146
I'm not capable of self-termination.

457
00:40:42,657 --> 00:40:45,180
- Suicide.
- I can't kill myself.

458
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,069
But you can.

459
00:40:50,763 --> 00:40:52,157
Why would I want to kill you?

460
00:40:52,972 --> 00:40:54,576
You might have to some day.

461
00:40:59,349 --> 00:41:02,449
I've planted an explosive in my skull
near my chip.

462
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:05,402
It's a small amount,
but it's enough.

463
00:41:13,087 --> 00:41:14,038
Enough?

464
00:41:20,974 --> 00:41:23,861
All you have to do
is hit the switch.

465
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:37,035
What would future John do now?

466
00:41:38,805 --> 00:41:40,805
Future John doesn't live here.

467
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:42,373
You do.
