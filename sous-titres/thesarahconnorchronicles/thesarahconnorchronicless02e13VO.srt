00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,342
Previously on the sarah connor chronicles...

2
00:00:03,343 --> 00:00:05,310
You like me? the loner weirdo?

3
00:00:05,311 --> 00:00:07,277
That's why I came up to you that day, john.

4
00:00:07,293 --> 00:00:09,318
I thought, since you're a weirdo,

5
00:00:09,319 --> 00:00:11,564
You might get me.

6
00:00:11,566 --> 00:00:12,690
She's a security risk.

7
00:00:12,693 --> 00:00:14,418
You understand that I'm gonna keep seeing riley,

8
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:16,419
Even if everyone thinks it's a bad idea.

9
00:00:16,419 --> 00:00:17,419
You're all crazy.

10
00:00:17,419 --> 00:00:18,719
It's all gonna burn,

11
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:21,419
And you're gonna be nothing but bleached skulls!

12
00:00:23,919 --> 00:00:25,619
You wanted to talk?

13
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:27,385
I don't think I can do this anymore.

14
00:00:27,385 --> 00:00:28,419
What if I want out?

15
00:00:28,419 --> 00:00:29,986
There is no out.

16
00:00:29,986 --> 00:00:31,719
We're developing a human interactive a.i.

17
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:33,153
Hello, mr. ellison.

18
00:00:33,153 --> 00:00:34,719
My name's john henry.

19
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:35,886
the a.i. needs to be trained.

20
00:00:35,886 --> 00:00:37,120
You taught it rules.

21
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,252
But it's got no ethics.

22
00:00:38,252 --> 00:00:39,352
What does this mean to you?

23
00:00:39,352 --> 00:00:41,053
I keep seeing it in my dreams, john.

24
00:00:41,053 --> 00:00:42,000
It means something.

25
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,385
It's written in blood on my basement wall.

26
00:00:43,385 --> 00:00:44,419
Mom, you're tired.

27
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:45,719
You've been sick.

28
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:48,086
Chasing killer robots will do that to you.

29
00:00:48,086 --> 00:00:49,999
Tell me about the three dots.

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,802
In 1490,the Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca,

31
00:01:10,802 --> 00:01:14,500
landed on the shore of this new world seeking power and fortune.

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,271
He was immediately attacked and captured.

33
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,906
Almost all of the travelling companions murdered.

34
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,500
Enslaved,de Vaca chose to embrace these capturer's beliefs

35
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,300
and learn their ways.

36
00:01:28,305 --> 00:01:30,005
He became a healer.

37
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,179
Over time he was freed.

38
00:01:32,214 --> 00:01:34,488
And de Vaca attracted his own following,

39
00:01:34,488 --> 00:01:37,331
who believed he had the power of life and death

40
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,782
The desert had transformed him.

41
00:01:39,787 --> 00:01:45,158
He was not the first,and he would not be the last

42
00:01:45,193 --> 00:01:49,937
It's like the world's been pulled out from under my feet.

43
00:01:49,937 --> 00:01:52,805
I don't know what's real and what's not.

44
00:01:52,805 --> 00:01:54,970
Eileen, what you're describing

45
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:59,438
Is common among experiencers such as yourself.

46
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:03,371
When a person lives through something beyond human understanding,

47
00:02:03,371 --> 00:02:04,504
We experience fear.

48
00:02:04,504 --> 00:02:06,137
A loss of control.

49
00:02:06,137 --> 00:02:07,538
A sense of isolation.

50
00:02:07,538 --> 00:02:11,504
And a deep, almost existential loneliness.

51
00:02:11,504 --> 00:02:12,538
And you...

52
00:02:12,538 --> 00:02:14,271
Miss fly on the wall.

53
00:02:14,271 --> 00:02:17,471
What brings you here today?

54
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,104
I'm sarah.

55
00:02:19,104 --> 00:02:20,704
Hello, sarah. welcome.

56
00:02:20,704 --> 00:02:23,704
I came here today because there have been reports

57
00:02:23,704 --> 00:02:25,871
Of people seeing ufos with this mark.

58
00:02:27,471 --> 00:02:29,304
I need to find out what it means.

59
00:02:29,304 --> 00:02:30,970
It's important to you.

60
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,237
I've been dreaming about it.

61
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:35,500
I'm having nightmares.

62
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,270
Are they nightmares, or are they memories?

63
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,065
My son thinks them crazy.

64
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,337
May not crazy,maybe that's the wrong word.

65
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:45,004
But he doubts me.

66
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:49,558
He's never doubted me before.

67
00:02:49,593 --> 00:02:53,741
If there's one thing we understand here,

68
00:02:53,776 --> 00:02:56,071
it's doubt.


70
00:03:00,901 --> 00:03:03,204
I have additional photos on my website.

71
00:03:04,533 --> 00:03:09,260
It's an actual photo of California drones

72
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:13,952
These alien's spacecraft has been spotted,

73
00:03:13,952 --> 00:03:15,969
in various locations around the State.

74
00:03:16,504 --> 00:03:19,053
Alien,not military?

75
00:03:19,101 --> 00:03:20,602
Definitely not military.

76
00:03:20,602 --> 00:03:22,035
The drone's loitering capability

77
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,001
Is far beyond anything our military has in its fleet.

78
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:26,896
The predator,the reaper

79
00:03:26,897 --> 00:03:29,657
None of them has anywhere near the presence that the drones do.

80
00:03:29,657 --> 00:03:31,212
And the symbol?

81
00:03:31,957 --> 00:03:34,725
Some witnesses have reported seeing

82
00:03:34,725 --> 00:03:38,128
The three dots on the hull of the spacecraft.

83
00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:40,785
The mark is also referred to in the Abraham blogs

84
00:03:42,386 --> 00:03:44,599
Abraham,claimed to be a scientist

85
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,232
Working on a top-secret alien-centered project

86
00:03:47,232 --> 00:03:49,533
Being covered up by the authorities.

87
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:52,332
The metal hyper-alloy that he was working with

88
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:56,399
Exhibited a tensile strength far beyond our existing technology.

89
00:03:56,399 --> 00:03:59,723
Fire, explosions, extreme pressure.

90
00:03:59,724 --> 00:04:01,456
This metal could survive it all.

91
00:04:01,457 --> 00:04:04,423
It was basically indestructible.

92
00:04:04,423 --> 00:04:07,390
Abraham-- where do I find him?

93
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,890
Well, that's the million-dollar question.

94
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:10,957
I don't know.

95
00:04:10,957 --> 00:04:12,657
No one knows.

96
00:04:12,657 --> 00:04:14,256
Abraham blogged a few times,

97
00:04:14,256 --> 00:04:16,790
Then he disappeared six months ago.

98
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,957
Think someone killed him?

99
00:04:23,123 --> 00:04:25,690
I know your type.

100
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,357
Come out, watch the kooks.

101
00:04:28,357 --> 00:04:31,290
Have a good laugh at our expense.

102
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,323
I'm not laughing at anyone.

103
00:04:33,323 --> 00:04:36,190
Enjoy the rest of the freak show.

104
00:04:40,024 --> 00:04:42,024
interested in abraham?

105
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:51,057
Hello?

106
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:52,091
Hey, john?

107
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:54,156
Hey, you coming home?

108
00:04:54,156 --> 00:04:56,357
No, I've got a lead. I'll be home late.

109
00:04:56,357 --> 00:04:59,223
From the flying saucer convention.

110
00:04:59,223 --> 00:05:02,724
The ufo experiencers, yes.

111
00:05:02,724 --> 00:05:04,557
There's a blogger named abraham.

112
00:05:04,557 --> 00:05:06,557
He may have been working with endoskeleton metal.

113
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:09,223
Oh, well, we all know how reliable bloggers are.

114
00:05:09,223 --> 00:05:11,256
Why do you have to be so sarcastic?

115
00:05:11,256 --> 00:05:13,991
Mom...

116
00:05:13,991 --> 00:05:16,590
Just be careful out there, okay?

117
00:05:26,624 --> 00:05:28,357
And I thought my room was a disaster.

118
00:05:28,357 --> 00:05:29,390
Your room is a disaster.

119
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,256
Berry bonanza or peachy keen?

120
00:05:34,724 --> 00:05:36,223
This is a work in progress, all right?

121
00:05:36,223 --> 00:05:38,590
It sure is something.

122
00:05:41,057 --> 00:05:42,156
You okay?

123
00:05:42,156 --> 00:05:44,924
I'm peachy keen.

124
00:05:44,924 --> 00:05:46,256
Why, do I not look peachy keen?

125
00:05:46,256 --> 00:05:49,890
You're smiling with your mouth, but not your eyes.

126
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,890
You're doing it right now.

127
00:05:55,357 --> 00:05:58,590
I flipped out at my foster mom.

128
00:05:59,957 --> 00:06:02,091
What do you mean, "flipped out"?

129
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:03,790
Two of the kids were fighting.

130
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,290
And it kind of got to me.

131
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,290
So I went on this little rant.

132
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:08,724
About what?

133
00:06:08,724 --> 00:06:12,957
They're just so naive, you know?

134
00:06:12,957 --> 00:06:15,057
They have no idea how good they have it.

135
00:06:15,057 --> 00:06:18,657
All they do is complain about every little thing,

136
00:06:18,657 --> 00:06:21,590
And everyone at school's the exact same way.

137
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:25,590
It's like one big whine-athon.

138
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,957
You're so lucky your mom's homeschooling you.

139
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,323
Yeah, it's been awesome.

140
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,690
You didn't buy me a smoothie.

141
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,523
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were here.

142
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,824
I'm always here.

143
00:06:42,557 --> 00:06:43,824
Cameron.

144
00:06:43,824 --> 00:06:45,991
I'm not sure we're gonna have enough paint.

145
00:06:45,991 --> 00:06:47,757
Would you do me a favor and go out and get some?

146
00:06:47,757 --> 00:06:51,957
You have 420 square feet to paint.

147
00:06:51,957 --> 00:06:53,490
What you have should be sufficient.

148
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:54,890
Two coats.

149
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,590
It's a bigger job than it looks.

150
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,624
I have a job too.

151
00:06:58,624 --> 00:07:00,190
Well, could you do it in the other room?

152
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,457
Please?

153
00:07:02,457 --> 00:07:04,890
Peachy keen is my favorite.

154
00:07:47,624 --> 00:07:49,024
Come here.

155
00:07:52,457 --> 00:07:54,190
You're a pretty girl.

156
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,590
What's your name?

157
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,690
Does abraham know we're coming?

158
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:17,724
Abraham doesn't live here. I do.

159
00:08:17,724 --> 00:08:18,824
But you said--

160
00:08:18,824 --> 00:08:20,123
If you're interested in abraham,

161
00:08:20,123 --> 00:08:22,024
You'll wanna see this.

162
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,835
Abraham's a pseudonym.

163
00:08:57,835 --> 00:08:59,835
Alan park is his real name.

164
00:08:59,835 --> 00:09:01,869
Has a masters from m.i.t.

165
00:09:01,869 --> 00:09:04,435
Specialized in something called lidar.

166
00:09:04,435 --> 00:09:06,002
Light detection and ranging.

167
00:09:06,002 --> 00:09:07,102
If you know what it stands for,

168
00:09:07,102 --> 00:09:09,235
Then you know that lidar is an optical

169
00:09:09,235 --> 00:09:10,568
Remote sensing technology.

170
00:09:10,568 --> 00:09:12,201
Like radar.

171
00:09:12,201 --> 00:09:14,435
Except with light.

172
00:09:14,435 --> 00:09:15,935
Its main application is...

173
00:09:15,935 --> 00:09:18,535
Robots.

174
00:09:18,535 --> 00:09:20,468
You say that like it's a bad thing.

175
00:09:20,468 --> 00:09:23,201
All I can offer you is tea.

176
00:09:23,201 --> 00:09:25,368
You seem more like a coffee type.

177
00:09:25,368 --> 00:09:26,735
So I've been told.

178
00:09:26,735 --> 00:09:29,802
Type "a."

179
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:32,368
Focused... goal-oriented.

180
00:09:32,368 --> 00:09:36,368
And yet here I stand with a cup of chamomile tea.

181
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:38,102
Can I ask you a personal question?

182
00:09:38,102 --> 00:09:39,201
Could I stop you?

183
00:09:39,201 --> 00:09:41,935
What are you doing out here?

184
00:09:41,935 --> 00:09:43,702
In the desert.

185
00:09:43,702 --> 00:09:45,235
Looking for answers.

186
00:09:45,235 --> 00:09:47,335
About abraham?

187
00:09:47,335 --> 00:09:49,402
Abraham, life.

188
00:09:49,402 --> 00:09:51,602
Whether the government is hiding little green men

189
00:09:51,602 --> 00:09:54,702
In fallout shelters.

190
00:09:54,702 --> 00:09:57,535
How to make the perfect cup of tea.

191
00:09:59,535 --> 00:10:00,802
You?

192
00:10:00,802 --> 00:10:03,201
I haven't figured out all my questions yet.

193
00:10:03,201 --> 00:10:05,602
Well, having a doubting thomas in the house can't help.

194
00:10:05,602 --> 00:10:08,168
How 'bout you? you got family?

195
00:10:08,168 --> 00:10:09,735
Or is this a one-gal operation?

196
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:12,168
Just me, myself, and the coyotes.

197
00:10:12,168 --> 00:10:14,535
Solitude.

198
00:10:14,535 --> 00:10:15,935
I remember it fondly.

199
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:18,602
Most of the time, I love it.

200
00:10:18,602 --> 00:10:20,102
Most of the time.

201
00:10:23,902 --> 00:10:26,368
These...are drone sightings.

202
00:10:26,368 --> 00:10:29,102
And these...

203
00:10:29,102 --> 00:10:32,136
Are sightings of abraham.

204
00:10:32,136 --> 00:10:33,935
This one's the most recent.

205
00:10:37,235 --> 00:10:39,835
Then that's where we'll start.

206
00:12:29,769 --> 00:12:30,969
This room is so adorable.

207
00:12:30,969 --> 00:12:33,102
How could you not like it?

208
00:12:33,102 --> 00:12:34,635
Because I'm not eight.

209
00:12:34,635 --> 00:12:36,769
Plus, it's my mom's subconscious way

210
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:38,368
Of trying to keep me a kid.

211
00:12:38,368 --> 00:12:40,468
The minute she took off, out came the paint brush.

212
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,935
Where'd she go?

213
00:12:41,935 --> 00:12:43,335
You don't wanna know.

214
00:12:43,335 --> 00:12:44,935
Yeah, I do, actually.

215
00:12:44,935 --> 00:12:45,935
Why?

216
00:12:45,935 --> 00:12:47,136
Um, because she's your mom,

217
00:12:47,136 --> 00:12:48,201
And I care about you.

218
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:52,402
Hey, you got somethin'.

219
00:12:56,835 --> 00:12:58,102
What happened to you?

220
00:12:58,102 --> 00:12:59,702
Nothing.

221
00:12:59,702 --> 00:13:00,702
That's a bruise.

222
00:13:00,702 --> 00:13:01,735
John, it's nothing.

223
00:13:01,735 --> 00:13:03,136
Who did that to you?

224
00:13:03,136 --> 00:13:05,036
John, please.

225
00:13:05,036 --> 00:13:06,201
Is that your foster dad?

226
00:13:06,201 --> 00:13:08,102
No, it was no one, okay?

227
00:13:08,102 --> 00:13:09,301
I'll kick his ass.

228
00:13:09,301 --> 00:13:10,735
John, it wasn't him, okay?

229
00:13:10,735 --> 00:13:12,201
I swear.

230
00:13:12,201 --> 00:13:14,102
Just drop it, please.

231
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:23,802
The answer's still no.

232
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:26,069
I can't do what you're asking.

233
00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:27,335
Shame.

234
00:13:27,335 --> 00:13:28,468
I thought a good night's sleep

235
00:13:28,468 --> 00:13:29,468
Would change your mind.

236
00:13:29,468 --> 00:13:30,969
I didn't sleep.

237
00:13:30,969 --> 00:13:32,002
John henry

238
00:13:32,002 --> 00:13:33,235
Needs someone to talk to,

239
00:13:33,235 --> 00:13:35,235
Now that dr. sherman is gone.

240
00:13:35,235 --> 00:13:36,735
Dr. sherman is gone

241
00:13:36,735 --> 00:13:39,201
Because he--it-- killed him.

242
00:13:39,201 --> 00:13:40,802
It wasn't murder, mr. ellison.

243
00:13:40,802 --> 00:13:42,902
You said so yourself.

244
00:13:42,902 --> 00:13:45,735
You also said I was remiss in creating john henry

245
00:13:45,735 --> 00:13:48,669
Without teaching him right from wrong.

246
00:13:48,669 --> 00:13:50,969
This is our opportunity to correct that oversight.

247
00:13:50,969 --> 00:13:53,769
"our" opportunity?

248
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:55,935
Your religious faith and paternal instinct

249
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:56,802
Make you the ideal candidate

250
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:59,535
To foster his moral development.

251
00:13:59,535 --> 00:14:03,535
That thing killed 20 fbi agents.

252
00:14:03,535 --> 00:14:06,869
It needs a whole lot more than just a talking to.

253
00:14:06,869 --> 00:14:11,168
The program responsible for those murders is gone.

254
00:14:11,168 --> 00:14:12,869
The john henry program is no more responsible

255
00:14:12,869 --> 00:14:14,669
For the deaths of those fbi agents

256
00:14:14,669 --> 00:14:16,301
Than you or i.

257
00:14:20,335 --> 00:14:21,600
Many believe

258
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,201
Tactile experience is integral to a.i. development.

259
00:14:25,201 --> 00:14:29,869
His body is merely a puppet.

260
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,769
An interface.

261
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:35,702
We control him.

262
00:14:35,702 --> 00:14:37,602
You control him.

263
00:14:45,036 --> 00:14:50,402
And when john henry completes...

264
00:14:50,402 --> 00:14:52,935
His development...

265
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:56,635
When he realizes what his puppet is capable of...

266
00:14:56,635 --> 00:14:58,769
Do you know how powerful he'll be?

267
00:14:58,769 --> 00:15:02,069
Cows are more powerful than man, mr. ellison.

268
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:04,502
But I'd still rather be the farmer with the rifle.

269
00:15:04,502 --> 00:15:06,869
Talk to john henry.

270
00:15:06,869 --> 00:15:08,735
Teach him right from wrong.

271
00:15:26,435 --> 00:15:29,102
You know, abraham was spotted here a week ago.

272
00:15:29,102 --> 00:15:31,069
By who? I don't know.

273
00:15:31,069 --> 00:15:33,969
It was an anonymous posting in a ufo chat room.

274
00:15:33,969 --> 00:15:35,702
Do you belong to many of the news groups?

275
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:37,802
I'm not much for computers.

276
00:15:37,802 --> 00:15:39,402
Usually, they go hand in hand.

277
00:15:39,402 --> 00:15:41,435
Computers, technology, visitations.

278
00:15:41,435 --> 00:15:42,535
Not for me.

279
00:15:42,535 --> 00:15:44,835
I'm only interested in the drones.

280
00:15:44,835 --> 00:15:47,335
In the markings. the ones that abraham saw.

281
00:15:47,335 --> 00:15:50,102
Everything comes back to abraham.

282
00:15:50,102 --> 00:15:51,435
I guess so.

283
00:15:53,102 --> 00:15:54,568
What are we doing here?

284
00:15:57,502 --> 00:16:00,769
Right now, I'm gonna go pee.


286
00:16:49,136 --> 00:16:50,136
Abraham.

287
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,102
Where is he?

288
00:16:53,102 --> 00:16:54,535
If you know, tell me now.

289
00:16:56,702 --> 00:16:58,301
I'm abraham.

290
00:16:58,301 --> 00:17:00,201
I'm the one you're looking for.

291
00:17:16,495 --> 00:17:18,862
My real name is alan park.

292
00:17:18,862 --> 00:17:20,561
What else is real?

293
00:17:20,561 --> 00:17:21,695
All of it.

294
00:17:21,695 --> 00:17:23,161
All of it?

295
00:17:23,161 --> 00:17:25,428
The research, the blogs.

296
00:17:25,428 --> 00:17:26,795
It's all true.

297
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:29,027
Except the woman part.

298
00:17:29,027 --> 00:17:30,395
My life was in danger.

299
00:17:30,395 --> 00:17:31,461
I needed to hide.

300
00:17:31,461 --> 00:17:32,695
- From who? - I don't know.

301
00:17:32,695 --> 00:17:34,094
Not good enough.

302
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:36,461
A few years after m.i.t.,

303
00:17:36,461 --> 00:17:38,061
I went to work for an aerospace firm.

304
00:17:38,061 --> 00:17:40,294
It was there that I was approached by a company

305
00:17:40,294 --> 00:17:43,361
That needed my expertise with lidar.

306
00:17:43,361 --> 00:17:45,294
The money was good.

307
00:17:45,294 --> 00:17:47,395
More than good. it was incredible.

308
00:17:47,395 --> 00:17:49,828
They gave us cars, company housing.

309
00:17:49,828 --> 00:17:51,094
What was the project?

310
00:17:51,094 --> 00:17:52,961
Well, that's the thing.

311
00:17:52,961 --> 00:17:54,261
I never knew.

312
00:17:54,261 --> 00:17:55,728
No one knew.

313
00:17:55,728 --> 00:17:57,228
We all signed n.d.a.s.

314
00:17:57,228 --> 00:17:58,762
Everybody worked in isolation.

315
00:17:58,762 --> 00:18:00,061
But we had access

316
00:18:00,061 --> 00:18:03,228
To technology and materials I'd never seen.

317
00:18:03,228 --> 00:18:06,395
Was it military?

318
00:18:07,495 --> 00:18:09,728
I started blogging.

319
00:18:09,728 --> 00:18:12,961
Asking if anyone recognized what I was working with.

320
00:18:12,961 --> 00:18:16,561
Strange things started to happen.

321
00:18:16,561 --> 00:18:18,795
My apartment was broken into,

322
00:18:18,795 --> 00:18:21,561
And then one day I was driving home from work

323
00:18:21,561 --> 00:18:23,328
And my brakes went out.

324
00:18:23,328 --> 00:18:25,595
The next morning, I went to the bank

325
00:18:25,595 --> 00:18:27,395
And withdrew all my savings.

326
00:18:27,395 --> 00:18:28,395
Went into hiding.

327
00:18:28,395 --> 00:18:30,728
Some disguise.

328
00:18:30,728 --> 00:18:32,094
I couldn't take any risks.

329
00:18:32,094 --> 00:18:33,927
Took a risk with me.

330
00:18:33,927 --> 00:18:36,294
You know something about all of this that I don't.

331
00:18:36,294 --> 00:18:37,294
I can tell.

332
00:18:37,294 --> 00:18:40,194
You have proof?

333
00:18:40,194 --> 00:18:41,961
Can you prove anything you just told me?

334
00:18:44,894 --> 00:18:46,762
I have a piece.

335
00:18:50,161 --> 00:18:51,261
The metal I was working with.

336
00:18:51,261 --> 00:18:52,927
I stole a piece before I left.

337
00:18:52,927 --> 00:18:54,528
Where is it?

338
00:18:54,528 --> 00:18:55,528
In the storage facility.

339
00:18:55,528 --> 00:18:58,361
I rented it the day I disappeared.

340
00:18:58,361 --> 00:18:59,495
I'll drive.

341
00:18:59,495 --> 00:19:01,328
It's not safe.

342
00:19:03,261 --> 00:19:04,495
It never is.

343
00:19:19,961 --> 00:19:22,128
you all right?

344
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:23,994
It's okay, if you're not.

345
00:19:25,528 --> 00:19:27,461
I want you to tell me if you're not.

346
00:19:27,461 --> 00:19:31,528
I'm all right.

347
00:19:31,528 --> 00:19:33,994
Maybe this color red is too bright.

348
00:19:33,994 --> 00:19:35,461
Maybe the brown was better.

349
00:19:35,461 --> 00:19:38,328
The red's perfect. you're just not used to it.

350
00:19:38,328 --> 00:19:42,661
The lady in the store said I was an autumn.

351
00:19:42,661 --> 00:19:45,094
I've never even seen autumn.

352
00:19:52,161 --> 00:19:54,495
Why did you pick me?

353
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:57,395
I always wanted to ask.

354
00:19:57,395 --> 00:19:59,061
But you never have.

355
00:19:59,061 --> 00:20:01,995
I thought you would tell me when the time was right.

356
00:20:03,595 --> 00:20:04,695
I think the time is right.

357
00:20:04,695 --> 00:20:07,027
No, sweetie.

358
00:20:11,828 --> 00:20:13,728
The time's past.

359
00:20:51,261 --> 00:20:53,027
What happened to your face?

360
00:20:53,027 --> 00:20:54,395
Nothing.

361
00:20:58,094 --> 00:20:59,395
How did you get hurt?

362
00:20:59,395 --> 00:21:01,595
It was nothing.

363
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:03,628
I smacked into a door.

364
00:21:03,628 --> 00:21:04,661
What part?

365
00:21:04,661 --> 00:21:05,661
What?

366
00:21:05,661 --> 00:21:07,261
Of the door.

367
00:21:07,261 --> 00:21:09,061
Oh, I don't know.

368
00:21:09,061 --> 00:21:11,061
Just the door.

369
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:13,094
I like your star.

370
00:21:13,094 --> 00:21:14,428
Excuse me?

371
00:21:14,428 --> 00:21:16,762
Your tattoo. it's tight.

372
00:21:16,762 --> 00:21:18,595
Thank you.

373
00:21:18,595 --> 00:21:21,528
I'm thinking of getting one.

374
00:21:21,528 --> 00:21:22,762
Can I look at yours?

375
00:21:28,795 --> 00:21:30,395
Did it hurt?

376
00:21:30,395 --> 00:21:31,927
Not too much.

377
00:21:31,927 --> 00:21:34,927
You stuck needles into your skin.

378
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:37,428
Needles can be painful.

379
00:21:37,428 --> 00:21:40,228
Hey...what's going on?

380
00:21:40,228 --> 00:21:42,328
I'm looking at her star.

381
00:21:42,328 --> 00:21:44,361
She's thinking about getting one.

382
00:21:46,428 --> 00:21:47,461
A tattoo?

383
00:21:47,461 --> 00:21:49,194
Of what?

384
00:21:49,194 --> 00:21:51,994
A tiger or a wolf.

385
00:21:51,994 --> 00:21:53,528
I haven't decided yet.

386
00:21:55,228 --> 00:21:56,461
We need to talk.

387
00:21:59,261 --> 00:22:02,428
I'm cool. really.

388
00:22:02,428 --> 00:22:04,161
Talk.

389
00:22:13,128 --> 00:22:15,728
Missed you at choir practice.

390
00:22:15,728 --> 00:22:17,261
Don't think my wife doesn't notice

391
00:22:17,261 --> 00:22:18,728
When her best baritone is gone.

392
00:22:18,728 --> 00:22:19,828
I'm sorry.

393
00:22:19,828 --> 00:22:21,361
Things have been crazy.

394
00:22:21,361 --> 00:22:22,994
Been going through a difficult time.

395
00:22:22,994 --> 00:22:25,027
We need to see more of you, not less.

396
00:22:25,027 --> 00:22:27,828
Do you remember I come from a big family?

397
00:22:27,828 --> 00:22:30,828
Seven kids.

398
00:22:30,828 --> 00:22:32,395
Before lila and I got married,

399
00:22:32,395 --> 00:22:34,361
We used to talk long into the night

400
00:22:34,361 --> 00:22:35,695
About how many kids we were gonna have.

401
00:22:35,695 --> 00:22:37,294
Family's a blessing.

402
00:22:37,294 --> 00:22:40,027
Yeah, she wanted three, maybe four.

403
00:22:40,027 --> 00:22:42,428
I was more in the four to five range.

404
00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:45,027
Sounds like there was room for compromise.

405
00:22:45,027 --> 00:22:46,061
Guess she wanted to wait

406
00:22:46,061 --> 00:22:47,495
Until she made it through quantico.

407
00:22:47,495 --> 00:22:49,894
I agreed.

408
00:22:49,894 --> 00:22:53,094
She graduated september 1, 2001.

409
00:22:53,094 --> 00:22:55,828
We started trying in earnest that very night.

410
00:22:57,828 --> 00:22:58,927
Ten days later.

411
00:22:58,927 --> 00:23:02,595
September 11th.

412
00:23:02,595 --> 00:23:05,762
She decided she didn't want to get pregnant anymore.

413
00:23:05,762 --> 00:23:07,461
Understandable reaction.

414
00:23:07,461 --> 00:23:10,094
But she already was.

415
00:23:13,762 --> 00:23:17,094
I didn't find out until after she had terminated it.

416
00:23:17,094 --> 00:23:19,395
Always wondered what happened

417
00:23:19,395 --> 00:23:20,528
Between you two.

418
00:23:20,528 --> 00:23:23,628
Yeah, that's what happened.

419
00:23:23,628 --> 00:23:26,361
When you called today, you said you wanted guidance.

420
00:23:28,128 --> 00:23:30,061
Yeah, that's true.

421
00:23:30,061 --> 00:23:32,027
This have something to do with lila?

422
00:23:32,027 --> 00:23:33,328
No.

423
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:35,094
Does it have something to do with the child?

424
00:23:36,828 --> 00:23:37,894
The child?

425
00:23:37,894 --> 00:23:39,395
Yes.

426
00:23:39,395 --> 00:23:41,561
Does this have something to do with the child?

427
00:23:43,027 --> 00:23:44,328
I don't know.

428
00:23:47,061 --> 00:23:49,862
I don't know.

429
00:24:13,061 --> 00:24:14,161
It's gone.

430
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:17,261
I swear, it was here.

431
00:24:22,862 --> 00:24:24,762
Sarah, they must have broken in.

432
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,574
Who are you?

433
00:25:04,574 --> 00:25:06,507
- What do you want from me? - The truth.

434
00:25:06,507 --> 00:25:07,841
I told you, I don't know.

435
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:10,008
The name on my paychecks led to a shell corporation.

436
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,008
It's all a dead end.

437
00:25:11,008 --> 00:25:12,041
You're lying.

438
00:25:12,041 --> 00:25:13,941
No!

439
00:25:13,941 --> 00:25:15,507
You're a liar and a fake.

440
00:25:15,507 --> 00:25:16,674
You're the fake!

441
00:25:16,674 --> 00:25:19,041
You're a mother.

442
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:20,574
You're a seeker.

443
00:25:20,574 --> 00:25:22,107
You're a soldier.

444
00:25:22,107 --> 00:25:24,774
You're everything.

445
00:25:24,774 --> 00:25:26,008
But you're nothing.

446
00:25:26,008 --> 00:25:28,307
You don't know anything about me.

447
00:25:28,307 --> 00:25:29,341
Oh, really?

448
00:25:29,341 --> 00:25:31,407
I'm a man who lives as woman,

449
00:25:31,407 --> 00:25:32,374
And you're a woman who lives as a--

450
00:25:36,841 --> 00:25:38,075
Stop.

451
00:25:38,075 --> 00:25:40,341
What made you so hard?

452
00:25:40,341 --> 00:25:41,641
Who are you working for?

453
00:25:41,641 --> 00:25:43,541
You almost got me killed.

454
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:45,407
Tell me. tell me about the metal.

455
00:25:45,407 --> 00:25:47,041
About the symbols.

456
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:48,674
The bullets.

457
00:25:48,674 --> 00:25:50,708
I could feel them. they were close.

458
00:25:50,708 --> 00:25:53,507
So close.

459
00:25:53,507 --> 00:25:55,174
We nearly died.

460
00:26:01,374 --> 00:26:03,008
You don't feel it.

461
00:26:06,008 --> 00:26:08,008
Why don't you feel it?

462
00:26:22,441 --> 00:26:25,274
I don't hate them, you know.

463
00:26:25,274 --> 00:26:27,741
They tried to kill you. twice.

464
00:26:27,741 --> 00:26:28,941
They did kill me.

465
00:26:28,941 --> 00:26:31,407
They killed Alan Park.

466
00:26:31,407 --> 00:26:32,374
And I thank them for it.

467
00:26:34,507 --> 00:26:36,140
They gave me a gift.

468
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,741
The life I was scared to lead.

469
00:26:38,741 --> 00:26:40,808
Before this happened, I was a cog in the machine.

470
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:43,507
Ordinary, repressed.

471
00:26:43,507 --> 00:26:47,207
How many people dare to live the life they dream of?

472
00:26:47,207 --> 00:26:51,041
Face...their real fears about who they really are?

473
00:26:51,041 --> 00:26:55,107
Not their houses, or their jobs, or their habits,

474
00:26:55,107 --> 00:26:57,941
But their deepest, truest selves.

475
00:27:00,674 --> 00:27:02,240
Do you have any idea what I'm talking about?

476
00:27:05,507 --> 00:27:07,374
I used to be a waitress.

477
00:27:09,441 --> 00:27:11,274
They killed her too.

478
00:27:15,975 --> 00:27:18,075
Tell me about your lab. where is it?

479
00:27:18,075 --> 00:27:19,941
They made sure we never knew.

480
00:27:19,941 --> 00:27:22,307
The company came and picked us up every morning.

481
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,008
Drove us in a van with blacked-out windows

482
00:27:24,008 --> 00:27:25,107
To the facility.

483
00:27:29,574 --> 00:27:30,574
What is it?

484
00:27:30,574 --> 00:27:33,741
There may be a way to help you remember.


486
00:27:53,474 --> 00:27:55,008
What are you doing here?

487
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:58,174
I'm sorry, Jesse.

488
00:27:58,174 --> 00:27:59,240
No one's following me.

489
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,307
I double backed, like you taught me.

490
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,608
Jesse, I'm really sorry.

491
00:28:03,608 --> 00:28:05,008
Don't get mad at me, please.

492
00:28:05,008 --> 00:28:07,174
Phones. that's why we have phones.

493
00:28:07,174 --> 00:28:09,307
I just didn't know where else to go.

494
00:28:09,507 --> 00:28:10,308
Yeah,well.

495
00:28:11,608 --> 00:28:14,008
Not here, sweetie.

496
00:28:14,008 --> 00:28:15,874
Any place but here.

497
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:18,741
I got kicked out of my foster home.

498
00:28:18,741 --> 00:28:20,041
You did what?

499
00:28:20,041 --> 00:28:21,474
I got kicked out.

500
00:28:21,474 --> 00:28:23,107
They threw me out,

501
00:28:23,107 --> 00:28:25,808
'cause I hit Kay, my foster mom.

502
00:28:25,808 --> 00:28:27,908
I was just freaking out.

503
00:28:27,908 --> 00:28:30,908
You know, I started thinking about everything.

504
00:28:30,908 --> 00:28:33,041
What's coming for all of us.

505
00:28:33,041 --> 00:28:35,140
For them.

506
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:38,808
I just--i need someone to talk to.

507
00:28:38,808 --> 00:28:40,374
I need you.

508
00:28:41,874 --> 00:28:43,240
I was thinking that,

509
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,140
Instead of just getting another foster home,

510
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,240
That maybe we could find someplace close together.

511
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,541
Like an apartment or something.

512
00:28:50,541 --> 00:28:53,174
I'll just tell John that I quit school, and--

513
00:28:53,174 --> 00:28:55,008
And we can be together.

514
00:28:59,908 --> 00:29:01,841
I'm not here to babysit.

515
00:29:01,841 --> 00:29:05,041
And you're not here to feel sorry for yourself.

516
00:29:05,041 --> 00:29:07,041
I'm not your friend.

517
00:29:07,041 --> 00:29:08,874
I am not your mother.

518
00:29:08,874 --> 00:29:12,107
And you are here...

519
00:29:12,107 --> 00:29:15,774
To keep John Connor away from her.

520
00:29:18,708 --> 00:29:20,708
Go finish your job.

521
00:29:22,407 --> 00:29:24,240
Go.

522
00:29:33,207 --> 00:29:34,708
She's lying.

523
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:39,240
About what?

524
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,240
I don't know, but her pulse was elevated

525
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,407
And her hand was perspiring.

526
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:45,107
She's lying.

527
00:29:45,107 --> 00:29:46,341
Yeah, her pulse was elevated

528
00:29:46,341 --> 00:29:48,274
Because you were freaking her out.

529
00:29:48,274 --> 00:29:49,341
As usual.

530
00:29:49,341 --> 00:29:51,274
What happened to her face?

531
00:29:51,274 --> 00:29:54,407
I don't know.

532
00:29:54,407 --> 00:29:55,407
She didn't say.

533
00:29:57,207 --> 00:29:59,274
I can get her to tell me the truth.

534
00:29:59,274 --> 00:30:01,741
Stay away from her.

535
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,641
Riley.

536
00:30:17,641 --> 00:30:19,608
Riley, answer me.

537
00:30:22,541 --> 00:30:24,574
Open it.

538
00:30:24,574 --> 00:30:25,774
Now.

539
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,500
New memories can be confusing,

540
00:30:48,501 --> 00:30:51,334
The question Sally poses is very important.

541
00:30:51,334 --> 00:30:53,234
How soon do we tell a new person in our lives

542
00:30:53,234 --> 00:30:56,267
That we've experienced an abduction?

543
00:30:56,267 --> 00:30:58,467
- Dr. Morris? - Sarah.

544
00:30:58,467 --> 00:31:00,134
We met at the UFO convention.

545
00:31:00,134 --> 00:31:02,267
I'm busy at the moment,

546
00:31:02,267 --> 00:31:04,367
But if you'd like to make an appointment.

547
00:31:04,367 --> 00:31:06,401
No appointment. it's an emergency.

548
00:31:11,901 --> 00:31:13,067
No matter what happens,

549
00:31:13,067 --> 00:31:15,267
I'm never going back to what I was.

550
00:31:15,267 --> 00:31:16,401
Good luck.

551
00:31:23,734 --> 00:31:25,467
Have a seat, please.

552
00:31:33,434 --> 00:31:36,968
Who taught you how to play chess?

553
00:31:36,968 --> 00:31:37,968
I did.

554
00:31:39,834 --> 00:31:41,968
Did you play with dr. sherman?

555
00:31:41,968 --> 00:31:44,301
No.

556
00:31:44,301 --> 00:31:45,401
We played other games.

557
00:31:45,401 --> 00:31:47,834
Talking games.

558
00:31:47,834 --> 00:31:50,267
Do you miss dr. sherman?

559
00:31:50,267 --> 00:31:52,568
I'm designed to learn.

560
00:31:52,568 --> 00:31:54,901
He helped me learn.

561
00:31:54,901 --> 00:31:57,167
His absence slows my growth.

562
00:31:57,167 --> 00:31:59,501
His absence...

563
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:01,167
Is more important than that.

564
00:32:03,467 --> 00:32:07,801
His value was more than just his function for you.

565
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:11,200
Human beings aren't like chess pieces.

566
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,668
It matters if we live or die.

567
00:32:12,668 --> 00:32:15,367
Why does it matter?

568
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:17,100
All humans die eventually.

569
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,801
Yes, that's true.

570
00:32:19,801 --> 00:32:22,935
But our lives are-- are sacred.

571
00:32:22,935 --> 00:32:24,501
Do you know what sacred means?

572
00:32:24,501 --> 00:32:27,001
Holy. worthy of respect.

573
00:32:27,001 --> 00:32:28,568
Venerable.

574
00:32:28,568 --> 00:32:31,367
Do you know why human life is sacred?

575
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:34,668
Because so few humans are alive Compared to the number that are dead?

576
00:32:34,668 --> 00:32:37,001
No.

577
00:32:37,001 --> 00:32:40,601
Because we're god's creation.

578
00:32:40,601 --> 00:32:43,035
God made everything.

579
00:32:43,035 --> 00:32:46,167
The stars, the earth,

580
00:32:46,167 --> 00:32:49,200
Everything on this planet.

581
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,467
We are all god's children.

582
00:32:52,467 --> 00:32:55,701
Am I god's child?

583
00:32:57,534 --> 00:33:00,834
That's one of the things we're here to talk about.

584
00:33:08,968 --> 00:33:10,568
Checkmate.

585
00:33:10,568 --> 00:33:11,568
I win.

586
00:33:13,067 --> 00:33:14,768
Would you like to play again?

587
00:33:17,601 --> 00:33:19,734
You body is completely relaxed.

588
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:22,778
I'm gonna count down from five,

589
00:33:22,778 --> 00:33:24,811
And when I reach one, you will be in the park

590
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:27,049
You ready?

591
00:33:27,049 --> 00:33:28,250
I'm ready.

592
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:31,417
5...4...

593
00:33:31,417 --> 00:33:34,617
3...2...1.

594
00:33:37,316 --> 00:33:38,383
Where are you?

595
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:40,383
What do you see?

596
00:33:40,383 --> 00:33:44,250
I'm waiting at the bench... For five other people.

597
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,983
We all live in town.

598
00:33:45,983 --> 00:33:48,417
We all climb inside the van.

599
00:33:48,417 --> 00:33:54,784
After a few miles,We come to a stop.

600
00:33:54,784 --> 00:33:56,450
There's a sound.

601
00:34:00,617 --> 00:34:03,350
At the end of the dirt road is a warehouse.

602
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:07,016
There's an office in front.

603
00:34:07,016 --> 00:34:09,283
No windows.

604
00:34:09,283 --> 00:34:10,750
No way to see in or out.

605
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:14,650
does that bother you?

606
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:17,983
no, I like not being seen.

607
00:34:17,983 --> 00:34:21,283
The van parks outside.

608
00:34:21,283 --> 00:34:23,850
The driver unlocks the door.

609
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:24,884
We head inside.

610
00:34:28,517 --> 00:34:29,550
Can I help you?

611
00:35:23,128 --> 00:35:25,294
Your body is completely relaxed,

612
00:35:25,294 --> 00:35:29,761
Your mind clear and open.

613
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:32,561
I'm gonna count down from five.

614
00:35:32,561 --> 00:35:35,128
When I reach one, you'll be in the park,

615
00:35:35,128 --> 00:35:36,361
Waiting for your ride to work.

616
00:35:36,361 --> 00:35:37,694
Are you ready?

617
00:35:37,694 --> 00:35:39,461
I'm ready.

618
00:35:39,461 --> 00:35:42,995
5...4...

619
00:35:42,995 --> 00:35:48,128
3...2...1.

620
00:35:50,162 --> 00:35:52,294
Where are you? what do you see?

621
00:35:56,394 --> 00:35:59,394
I'm waiting at the bench...For five other people.

622
00:35:59,394 --> 00:36:02,195
We all live in town.

623
00:36:02,195 --> 00:36:03,995
Here it comes now.

624
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,694
the van?

625
00:36:05,694 --> 00:36:08,294
it approaches from the left.

626
00:36:09,961 --> 00:36:12,828
We climb inside the van.

627
00:36:12,828 --> 00:36:15,828
It heads north out of town.

628
00:36:20,561 --> 00:36:21,995
It's...dim inside.

629
00:36:21,995 --> 00:36:23,195
I can barely see.

630
00:36:27,728 --> 00:36:30,327
does the darkness disturb you?

631
00:36:30,327 --> 00:36:32,061
no.

632
00:36:32,061 --> 00:36:34,828
Secrecy doesn't bother me.

633
00:36:34,828 --> 00:36:37,661
Because I have a secret too.

634
00:36:37,661 --> 00:36:41,861
and what's your secret?

635
00:36:41,861 --> 00:36:45,128
I'm not who they think I am.

636
00:36:47,294 --> 00:36:50,162
After a few miles,

637
00:36:50,162 --> 00:36:51,528
We come to a stop.

638
00:36:57,461 --> 00:36:59,494
There's a sound.

639
00:36:59,494 --> 00:37:02,095
what is it?

640
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:04,628
Eileen?

641
00:37:04,628 --> 00:37:06,928
I don't know.

642
00:37:06,928 --> 00:37:09,561
The sound, it doesn't--

643
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:11,528
trust yourself.

644
00:37:11,528 --> 00:37:14,895
The truth is inside you.

645
00:37:14,895 --> 00:37:16,828
What do you hear?

646
00:37:16,828 --> 00:37:18,628
it's rain.

647
00:37:18,628 --> 00:37:19,895
Every day.

648
00:37:23,895 --> 00:37:26,327
But the heat... we're in the desert.

649
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:28,427
It doesn't make sense.

650
00:37:30,728 --> 00:37:32,694
Nothing makes sense.

651
00:37:35,694 --> 00:37:39,095
We're on a dirt road.

652
00:37:39,095 --> 00:37:40,195
Now a bump.

653
00:37:41,394 --> 00:37:43,262
A clacking under the tires.

654
00:37:47,594 --> 00:37:50,427
At the end of the dirt road is a warehouse.

655
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:29,803
there's an office in front.

656
00:38:29,803 --> 00:38:33,404
No windows, no way to see in or out.

657
00:38:33,404 --> 00:38:35,836
does that bother you?

658
00:38:35,836 --> 00:38:39,204
no, I like not being seen.

659
00:38:39,204 --> 00:38:41,504
I don't know who they are.

660
00:38:41,504 --> 00:38:42,903
But that's okay,

661
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:45,770
Because they don't know who I really am either.

662
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:49,204
and who are you?

663
00:38:53,003 --> 00:38:54,736
I'm a waitress.

664
00:39:05,571 --> 00:39:08,270
Will do. First thing in the morning.

665
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:13,037
I'm sorry, ma'am. we're closed.

666
00:39:13,037 --> 00:39:14,103
Where's the metal?

667
00:39:14,103 --> 00:39:15,637
Please...don't shoot.

668
00:39:15,637 --> 00:39:16,736
Please don't shoot.

669
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,003
The metal! where is it?

670
00:39:18,003 --> 00:39:19,237
I don't know what you're talking about.

671
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:21,870
Who are you?

672
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:24,003
My name's winston.

673
00:39:24,003 --> 00:39:25,770
I install air conditioning, all right?

674
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:27,537
Please don't hurt me.

675
00:39:27,537 --> 00:39:30,037
I have a wife. I have a son.

676
00:39:30,037 --> 00:39:33,770
I'm his coach.

677
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:35,437
I'm his little league coach.

678
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:38,270
Put your hands on your head.

679
00:39:41,604 --> 00:39:43,237
What's in the warehouse?

680
00:39:43,237 --> 00:39:44,937
I don't know.

681
00:39:44,937 --> 00:39:46,604
My boss...rents it out to another company.

682
00:39:46,604 --> 00:39:47,770
Look, I'm just an installer.

683
00:39:56,504 --> 00:39:57,903
Look, I know where you live.

684
00:39:57,903 --> 00:39:58,970
Don't call the police.
