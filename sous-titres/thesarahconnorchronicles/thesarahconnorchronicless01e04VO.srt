<i>In the future,</i>

2
00:00:08,353 --> 00:00:11,394
<i>my son will lead mankind
in a war against Skynet,</i>

3
00:00:12,685 --> 00:00:15,785
<i>a computer system programmed
to destroy the world.</i>

4
00:00:17,394 --> 00:00:20,035
<i>It has sent machines
back through time...</i>

5
00:00:20,642 --> 00:00:22,078
<i>some to kill him...</i>

6
00:00:22,305 --> 00:00:23,902
<i>one to protect him.</i>

7
00:00:24,148 --> 00:00:27,456
<i>Today we fight to stop Skynet
from ever being created.</i>

8
00:00:27,865 --> 00:00:29,621
<i>To change our future.</i>

9
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,122
<i>To change his fate.</i>

10
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:36,140

00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:45,366
<i>Previously on</i> Terminator:
The Sarah Connor Chronicles.

14
00:00:45,486 --> 00:00:46,966
Mr. Ferguson is ill today.

15
00:00:47,919 --> 00:00:49,094
My name is Cromartie.

16
00:00:49,254 --> 00:00:50,720
Do we have a John Reese?

17
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,981
Excellent.

18
00:00:56,803 --> 00:00:59,688
<i>You changed the future.
You just didn't change it enough.</i>

19
00:01:01,599 --> 00:01:03,178
These things, they are here.

20
00:01:03,738 --> 00:01:06,069
<i>And they are programmed
with specific missions.</i>

21
00:01:11,227 --> 00:01:12,826
It took his eyes, James.

22
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:15,829
<i>Jumper, outside the gym!</i>

23
00:01:16,072 --> 00:01:18,081
It's my new friend,
crying one from the bathroom.

24
00:01:18,241 --> 00:01:19,999
- We gotta help her, now!
- No.

25
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:24,301
<i>I Could have done something.</i>

26
00:01:24,421 --> 00:01:25,505
I was right there.

27
00:01:25,665 --> 00:01:27,632
And what were you gonna do
be a hero?

28
00:01:27,792 --> 00:01:29,300
Isn't that what I'm supposed to be?

29
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,469
A hero? Isn't that who I am?

30
00:01:47,794 --> 00:01:49,798
Patient is female, 33.

31
00:01:49,918 --> 00:01:52,614
Previous lipo and breast
augmentation with complications

32
00:01:52,734 --> 00:01:54,951
of seroma and scarring.

33
00:01:57,665 --> 00:01:58,466
Hello?

34
00:02:11,087 --> 00:02:11,889
Hello?

35
00:02:32,121 --> 00:02:33,239
<i>When John was little,</i>

36
00:02:33,399 --> 00:02:34,647
<i>before bed,</i>

37
00:02:34,827 --> 00:02:36,868
<i>I used to read him fairy tales.</i>

38
00:02:37,082 --> 00:02:40,280
<i>One night, I read him a folk tale
called the Golem Prague,</i>

39
00:02:40,526 --> 00:02:42,617
<i>the story of a clay monster
made by a rabbi</i>

40
00:02:42,737 --> 00:02:44,698
<i>to protect the Jews of the city.</i>

41
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:47,253
You shouldn't be back here.
The office is clos.

42
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:56,011
<i>You do reconstructive surgery?</i>

43
00:02:56,131 --> 00:02:58,264
You need a consult.
You'll he to call monday.

44
00:02:58,424 --> 00:03:00,233
<i>I need reconstructive surgery.</i>

45
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,589
You can either just leave now

46
00:03:02,763 --> 00:03:04,755
or I can call the police.
Your choice.

47
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:07,134
<i>What I failed to remember was that,
at the end of the story,</i>

48
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:09,192
<i>the Golem turns on
its maker and kills him,</i>

49
00:03:09,312 --> 00:03:10,998
<i>as well as the rest of the town.</i>

50
00:03:11,118 --> 00:03:11,816
<i>Now.</i>

51
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,757
<i>He didn't sleep for months.</i>

52
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:18,493
<i>I went to him and tried to tell him that
it wasn't real, that I'd made it all up.</i>

53
00:03:20,846 --> 00:03:22,989
<i>Somehow, that made it all worse.</i>

54
00:03:40,925 --> 00:03:42,267
Up a little late?

55
00:03:50,743 --> 00:03:52,919
"Covalent and ionic bonding."

56
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,465
No wonder you're still up.

57
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,118
I can never get my head
around this either.

58
00:04:00,278 --> 00:04:01,610
It's not that hard.

59
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,001
So you wanna talk about it?

60
00:04:08,161 --> 00:04:10,503
- Talk about what?
- You just seem down.

61
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,755
Downer than usual.

62
00:04:13,913 --> 00:04:14,933
I'm fine.

63
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,334
I know what fine means.

64
00:04:17,454 --> 00:04:19,929
Fine means you're upset about something,
and you won't talk to me.

65
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:21,723
Fine means I'm fine.

66
00:04:23,787 --> 00:04:27,020
I saw there's a memorial service
at school this week for that girl.

67
00:04:27,431 --> 00:04:28,234
Jordan.

68
00:04:28,354 --> 00:04:29,565
Jordan, right.

69
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,400
- Are you planning on going?
- I try not to make plans.

70
00:04:33,621 --> 00:04:36,716
Plans are for people
in control of their own lives.

71
00:04:38,143 --> 00:04:40,450
I don't want you to blame
yourself for what happened.

72
00:04:43,234 --> 00:04:44,746
Who said I blame myself?

73
00:04:45,095 --> 00:04:47,488
- What do you want?
- Cromartie's here.

74
00:04:48,117 --> 00:04:49,751
- Now.
- What?

75
00:04:52,162 --> 00:04:54,547
I've been monitoring the media
for possible threats.

76
00:04:55,209 --> 00:04:56,007
Yesterday,

77
00:04:56,508 --> 00:04:58,667
arson at an Oakland dock
forced the rerouting

78
00:04:58,787 --> 00:05:01,638
of a shipment of refined coltan
into the port of Los Angeles.

79
00:05:01,798 --> 00:05:02,513
Coltan?

80
00:05:02,673 --> 00:05:05,475
Skynet will use it as a key element
in our endoskeletal alloy.

81
00:05:05,635 --> 00:05:07,393
That doesn't mean Cromartie's back.

82
00:05:07,554 --> 00:05:09,246
How can it be Cromartie?

83
00:05:09,522 --> 00:05:11,314
Are you forgetting that
I blew his head off?

84
00:05:11,474 --> 00:05:12,594
I remember.

85
00:05:12,933 --> 00:05:14,734
That's why I went to find this.

86
00:05:16,877 --> 00:05:18,121
You should watch.

87
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,328
It won't play.

88
00:05:25,906 --> 00:05:27,288
Put it on video 2.

89
00:05:31,113 --> 00:05:32,251
Thanks for explaining.

90
00:05:32,411 --> 00:05:33,753
Where'd you get this?

91
00:05:33,913 --> 00:05:35,911
Check the paper tomorrow
for any dead anchormen.

92
00:05:36,031 --> 00:05:37,090
I don't sleep.

93
00:05:42,307 --> 00:05:43,059
There.

94
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:53,163
He came through. He knows we're here.

95
00:05:53,283 --> 00:05:54,649
It's just a head.

96
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,275
His chip is intact.

97
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,569
We're programmed to repair ourselves.

98
00:05:58,729 --> 00:06:00,446
We're programmed to blend in.

99
00:06:00,606 --> 00:06:03,866
He might still need coltan
for a missing piece. A leg, an arm.

100
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:05,952
He'll rebuild

101
00:06:06,112 --> 00:06:08,913
and continue his mission
to hunt and kill.

102
00:06:09,073 --> 00:06:10,623
I know what his mission is.

103
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,624
I still have the money
from the safe house.

104
00:06:18,744 --> 00:06:21,092
We can go south,
set up across the border,

105
00:06:21,252 --> 00:06:23,056
- off the grid.
- Go south...

106
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,270
What?

107
00:06:26,118 --> 00:06:27,966
Thought you said we
weren't gonna run anymore.

108
00:06:28,086 --> 00:06:29,527
We were gonna fight.

109
00:06:29,795 --> 00:06:30,852
This is different.

110
00:06:31,012 --> 00:06:32,353
Right, this is different.

111
00:06:32,513 --> 00:06:34,263
If Cromartie's damaged, he's vulnerable.

112
00:06:34,383 --> 00:06:37,353
- We know where he'll be.
- A new skin means a new face.

113
00:06:37,535 --> 00:06:40,306
- We won't know what he looks like.
- But we know where he'll be.

114
00:06:40,426 --> 00:06:43,896
I can hack the port schedule.
We find the container and we wait.

115
00:06:44,016 --> 00:06:45,283
We hunt him for a change.

116
00:06:45,443 --> 00:06:47,452
Or we could run... again.

117
00:06:54,737 --> 00:06:56,044
The ship comes tonight?

118
00:06:56,204 --> 00:06:58,004
The one carrying the coltan?

119
00:06:58,124 --> 00:06:59,005
5:00 A.M.

120
00:07:08,348 --> 00:07:09,851
Like you're gonna drive.

121
00:07:11,146 --> 00:07:12,545
Get the shotguns.

122
00:07:13,574 --> 00:07:15,156
It's not like I can't drive.

123
00:07:15,276 --> 00:07:18,177
And the C-4 from the bathroom
under the towels.

124
00:08:23,723 --> 00:08:24,590
Cromartie?

125
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,937
Not here yet.

126
00:08:26,057 --> 00:08:28,302
- They're humans.
- Keep setting the charges.

127
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:31,973
If he comes for that container,
he'll have to come through here.

128
00:08:53,254 --> 00:08:54,328
Is that Cromartie?

129
00:08:54,626 --> 00:08:55,527
Cameron.

130
00:09:25,675 --> 00:09:26,877
He'll survive.

131
00:09:27,813 --> 00:09:28,696
He's human.

132
00:09:29,113 --> 00:09:30,323
Not very strong one.

133
00:09:47,205 --> 00:09:48,925
Those other guys just stole the truck.

134
00:09:50,406 --> 00:09:52,656
Cromartie has men working with him?
Does that happen?

135
00:09:52,776 --> 00:09:53,888
You work with me.

136
00:09:56,967 --> 00:09:59,047
We have to follow that truck.

137
00:10:21,616 --> 00:10:22,817
That's coltan.

138
00:10:23,195 --> 00:10:26,598
If that's what you're made of,
no wonder you're so dense.

139
00:10:27,644 --> 00:10:28,744
Not density.

140
00:10:29,164 --> 00:10:30,504
Heat resistance.

141
00:10:30,876 --> 00:10:33,261
Two 600 models had
a titanium alloy endoskeleton.

142
00:10:33,421 --> 00:10:35,273
But it was vulnerable to heat.

143
00:10:35,393 --> 00:10:39,393
- Coltan have higher melting point.
- You know what I love about you guys?

144
00:10:39,645 --> 00:10:42,603
Even when you've evolved into the
ultimate indestructible killing machine,

145
00:10:43,084 --> 00:10:45,690
you're not above self-examination
and improvement.

146
00:10:47,232 --> 00:10:48,025
Thank you.

147
00:10:48,285 --> 00:10:49,360
Please shut up.

148
00:10:55,609 --> 00:10:56,742
Military tags?

149
00:10:58,446 --> 00:10:59,638
Leave it.

150
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:02,166
We need to move.
Now.

151
00:11:03,265 --> 00:11:05,626
How about we get paid now, seriously?

152
00:11:05,786 --> 00:11:07,755
How about you shut up and go now?

153
00:11:19,842 --> 00:11:21,517
He's not damaged at all.

154
00:11:26,955 --> 00:11:28,274
That's not Cromartie.

155
00:11:28,864 --> 00:11:30,985
Endoskeletal structure points
don't match.

156
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,662
He's too short.

157
00:11:35,045 --> 00:11:36,234
Another one?

158
00:11:37,616 --> 00:11:39,184
Why does he have all this?

159
00:11:39,304 --> 00:11:41,996
I thought these things
just hunt and killed people.

160
00:11:42,156 --> 00:11:45,358
They perform whatever mission
they're programmed for.

161
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,127
And what kind of mission is this?

162
00:11:50,164 --> 00:11:51,916
Man, it weirds me out more and more.

163
00:11:52,036 --> 00:11:54,884
We barely get a crime scene up,
and the FBI is here like that.

164
00:11:55,193 --> 00:11:57,625
Like you guys got some kind
of magic powers or something.

165
00:11:57,745 --> 00:11:58,786
Thanks, Lou.

166
00:11:58,906 --> 00:12:00,139
Computers, my friend.

167
00:12:00,467 --> 00:12:03,004
Log in a weird blood sample
that matches one of my other cases,

168
00:12:03,124 --> 00:12:04,275
and, poof, I appear.

169
00:12:04,395 --> 00:12:06,574
They're gonna put us
all out of work one of these days...

170
00:12:06,694 --> 00:12:08,180
not that I'll mind.

171
00:12:08,682 --> 00:12:10,485
Wouldn't worry about that.

172
00:12:11,295 --> 00:12:13,792
Always gonna need somebody to clean up.

173
00:12:15,676 --> 00:12:18,199
- So who we got here?
- Dr. David Lyman,

174
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:19,628
plastic surgeon.

175
00:12:19,924 --> 00:12:22,969
Obviously, the manager found him
this morning when she came to open up.

176
00:12:23,556 --> 00:12:26,256
Swabbed your weird blood
out of the drain.

177
00:12:26,715 --> 00:12:29,076
Otherwise, the place is clean.
Nothing missing,

178
00:12:29,495 --> 00:12:31,287
no motive, zip.

179
00:12:32,424 --> 00:12:35,405
- So what's your interest here?
- I got six guys dead,

180
00:12:35,525 --> 00:12:36,675
no rhyme or reason.

181
00:12:37,055 --> 00:12:40,262
Except some kind of blood
that isn't quite blood.

182
00:12:40,422 --> 00:12:41,820
It's not natural.

183
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,678
I like natural.

184
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:47,478
Natural's assuring.
It helps me sleep at night.

185
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:50,231
I meant more the FBI's interest.

186
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,090
You know the FBI.

187
00:12:55,546 --> 00:12:57,644
We're interested in everything.

188
00:12:58,877 --> 00:13:00,083
So this guy...

189
00:13:01,404 --> 00:13:03,005
comes in Friday night.

190
00:13:05,864 --> 00:13:07,553
Leaves Sunday, A.M.

191
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,185
That's the only lead
we have at the moment.

192
00:13:11,305 --> 00:13:13,838
I thought he looked familiar.
He was a patient.

193
00:13:14,266 --> 00:13:16,466
We did his chin and nose last May.

194
00:13:16,586 --> 00:13:17,786
George Lazlo.

195
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:28,352
We still have the charges.
We can rig 'em at the door.

196
00:13:28,717 --> 00:13:31,355
Blow 'em when they try to drive out.
Then cameron can take out...

197
00:13:31,515 --> 00:13:33,315
Get in the car. We're going.

198
00:13:35,092 --> 00:13:35,939
What?

199
00:13:36,562 --> 00:13:39,363
John, the plan was to hunt Cromartie.
That's not Cromartie.

200
00:13:39,523 --> 00:13:42,325
So you just wanna walk in there,
kick their asses and go for pancakes?

201
00:13:42,445 --> 00:13:44,277
It doesn't work like that.
We're outnumbered.

202
00:13:44,397 --> 00:13:46,579
- We have her.
- We don't know what's going on.

203
00:13:46,739 --> 00:13:49,439
That thing has real estated
his employees.

204
00:13:50,122 --> 00:13:52,238
Who knows how many more are in there.

205
00:13:52,453 --> 00:13:54,958
There's three of us.
I'm not saying we run.

206
00:13:55,245 --> 00:13:57,131
But we need to step back,
see what's going on.

207
00:13:57,427 --> 00:13:59,258
So we run, in other words.

208
00:13:59,418 --> 00:14:02,362
- Can you tell him to get in the car?
- It's too dangerous.

209
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,597
- We should go.
- It's always too dangerous!

210
00:14:04,757 --> 00:14:06,474
It's war. War is dangerous!

211
00:14:08,035 --> 00:14:09,232
If you die...

212
00:14:10,085 --> 00:14:10,978
they win.

213
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:16,854
How many of those things,
those endoskeletons,

214
00:14:16,974 --> 00:14:19,519
do you think they can make out
of that load of metal in there?

215
00:14:19,737 --> 00:14:23,206
'Cause that's what we're talking about.
It's a truck full of enemy soldiers.

216
00:14:23,443 --> 00:14:25,409
What if they're building them right now?

217
00:14:25,569 --> 00:14:28,642
If I could get myself on into the truck,
we can track them by laptop.

218
00:14:28,847 --> 00:14:30,901
John Connor, we're going... now.

219
00:14:40,953 --> 00:14:42,176
530.

220
00:14:42,755 --> 00:14:43,552
What?

221
00:14:43,915 --> 00:14:45,116
Endoskeletons.

222
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:48,776
Based on the approximate volume
of coltan in this shipment.

223
00:14:49,033 --> 00:14:50,518
That's how many.

224
00:14:54,214 --> 00:14:55,018
John!

225
00:14:57,936 --> 00:14:59,151
Damn it, John!

226
00:14:59,311 --> 00:15:00,111
No!

227
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,405
If they see us, they'll find him.

228
00:16:09,906 --> 00:16:11,974
You wanna tell me
what you're doing here?

229
00:16:20,025 --> 00:16:21,442
Have you seen a dachshund puppy?

230
00:17:30,934 --> 00:17:32,632
They had army uniforms.

231
00:17:33,215 --> 00:17:34,216
The tags.

232
00:17:34,406 --> 00:17:35,908
Where would they go?

233
00:17:36,364 --> 00:17:37,643
They're going north.

234
00:17:37,803 --> 00:17:39,002
John's phone.

235
00:17:39,245 --> 00:17:40,521
You can track it online.

236
00:17:41,557 --> 00:17:43,065
This actually works?

237
00:18:00,784 --> 00:18:02,292
Wait, wait, wait.
No, no.

238
00:18:03,236 --> 00:18:04,714
The signal is lost.

239
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:07,005
- The phone might be damaged.
- Come on.

240
00:18:07,165 --> 00:18:08,090
Damn it!

241
00:18:28,812 --> 00:18:31,280
- Come on!
- Breaking the computer won't help.

242
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:33,881
Do you have any idea
what's going on? I lost him.

243
00:18:34,141 --> 00:18:35,033
I lost John.

244
00:18:35,816 --> 00:18:36,827
I understand.

245
00:18:36,987 --> 00:18:39,037
It's impossible for you to understand.

246
00:18:40,765 --> 00:18:42,875
Without John, your life has no purpose.

247
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:46,051
I can't believe I let him
talk me into this.

248
00:18:48,944 --> 00:18:51,967
You try to open your hands
just a little, and it's too soon.

249
00:18:52,127 --> 00:18:53,025
Is it?

250
00:18:54,284 --> 00:18:55,804
The world ends in four years.

251
00:19:43,985 --> 00:19:44,686
What?

252
00:19:44,846 --> 00:19:47,314
Left you a message.
Davidson was buying at Houston's.

253
00:19:47,474 --> 00:19:50,925
When you didn't show, they sent me to
check to see if you'd died or something.

254
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:52,110
Did you die?

255
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:54,488
You run across him
on those pico murders?

256
00:19:55,816 --> 00:19:57,199
Or John Doe's bar code tats?

257
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:00,285
- No... who is he?
- George Lazlo. Unemployed actor.

258
00:20:00,445 --> 00:20:02,246
Got him on video at the murder scene.

259
00:20:02,406 --> 00:20:05,582
Only suspect I got
with his file is straight vanilla.

260
00:20:05,742 --> 00:20:08,108
Are you trying to impress the boss?

261
00:20:08,537 --> 00:20:11,060
Crank out the sugar ray
and call Monica Lewinksy.

262
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,851
It's 1999 again.

263
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,883
- Sugar what?
- James...

264
00:20:15,401 --> 00:20:17,780
If you trying to get back
on the rising young star list,

265
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,929
forget about it.

266
00:20:19,297 --> 00:20:21,114
I mean, this case is a dog.

267
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,516
And you're not young.

268
00:20:25,053 --> 00:20:26,988
Agent Stewart, can I help you?

269
00:20:27,556 --> 00:20:29,841
You got some guy holed up in room three?

270
00:20:30,306 --> 00:20:31,692
That would be my dog.

271
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:33,741
Lazlo?

272
00:20:34,739 --> 00:20:37,781
He asked if he needed a lawyer.
I told him it was just a courtesy thing.

273
00:20:37,941 --> 00:20:39,366
So what's this all about?

274
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:42,430
It's about my case.

275
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,415
Good case?

276
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:48,458
We'll find out soon enough.

277
00:20:48,816 --> 00:20:50,736
He strike you as a killer?

278
00:20:51,207 --> 00:20:53,111
Everyone strikes me as a killer.

279
00:20:59,523 --> 00:21:01,542
So... George...

280
00:21:01,966 --> 00:21:03,275
you're an actor.

281
00:21:04,384 --> 00:21:05,684
Been in anything I've seen?

282
00:21:06,573 --> 00:21:07,811
What is this about?

283
00:21:07,971 --> 00:21:10,355
Just some questions
related to Dr. Lyman's death.

284
00:21:12,726 --> 00:21:15,277
So...anything?
I see a lot of movies.

285
00:21:16,281 --> 00:21:17,237
It's been slow.

286
00:21:17,397 --> 00:21:20,318
Well, it's picking up
around here, I'll tell you that.

287
00:21:20,892 --> 00:21:23,749
I got six dead bodies

288
00:21:24,112 --> 00:21:25,996
and a mystery man

289
00:21:26,156 --> 00:21:28,837
who might be trying
to change his identity.

290
00:21:29,439 --> 00:21:30,876
So is that why you got the work?

291
00:21:31,036 --> 00:21:32,461
Chin and nose.

292
00:21:32,621 --> 00:21:35,260
Did you kill the doctor
to cover your tracks?

293
00:21:38,313 --> 00:21:39,509
Ah, Dolores.

294
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:41,210
Meet Mr. Lazlo.

295
00:21:42,741 --> 00:21:45,891
I was hoping that he would give us
a little blood sample.

296
00:21:46,657 --> 00:21:47,851
If you're not my guy,

297
00:21:48,011 --> 00:21:50,621
you're out of my file here
in an hour, tops.

298
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:56,525
Make a fist.

299
00:21:57,521 --> 00:21:58,570
Great.

300
00:22:03,342 --> 00:22:04,815
Just a little sting.

301
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:12,084
Can't seem to find a vein.

302
00:22:18,917 --> 00:22:21,779
You guys are a bunch
of fascists, you know that?

303
00:22:34,154 --> 00:22:36,009
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

304
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,819
Tell me where they went.

305
00:22:39,761 --> 00:22:40,821
Lady, go to hell.

306
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:43,532
Tell me where they went,
or I'm gonna beat you to death.

307
00:22:45,402 --> 00:22:46,576
And don't call me lady.

308
00:22:47,216 --> 00:22:49,143
Tell me where they went, damn it!

309
00:22:51,097 --> 00:22:53,763
If you beat him to death,
he can't tell us anything.

310
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,545
I'm not gonna tell you anything.

311
00:22:56,705 --> 00:22:57,721
Okay.

312
00:23:04,544 --> 00:23:06,054
Yeah, like you got the stones.

313
00:23:18,268 --> 00:23:19,400
You can go.

314
00:23:22,052 --> 00:23:23,717
If you can get past her.

315
00:23:49,683 --> 00:23:53,045
Mcguire Gunnery range?
This place is the size of L.A. County.

316
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:55,062
Where exactly are they?

317
00:23:55,738 --> 00:23:57,022
She's talking to you.

318
00:23:58,006 --> 00:23:59,357
It's depot 37.

319
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,069
It's a decommissioned arms depot

320
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,676
in the southeast corner.

321
00:24:03,922 --> 00:24:07,368
You take the outer loop past
all these old, abandoned hangars.

322
00:24:07,944 --> 00:24:09,868
It was an air force base
back in the cold war...

323
00:24:10,226 --> 00:24:11,642
I don't know what they're doing.

324
00:24:11,762 --> 00:24:14,094
I was supposed to guard the warehouse,
clean up when they left.

325
00:24:14,214 --> 00:24:15,582
The man just needed guys.

326
00:24:15,878 --> 00:24:17,847
That's all I know. I swear to God.

327
00:24:18,011 --> 00:24:19,169
Just drive faster.

328
00:24:29,506 --> 00:24:30,931
Badge, please.

329
00:24:48,579 --> 00:24:50,075
Your tax dollars at work.

330
00:25:04,498 --> 00:25:06,299
What, you need more blood?

331
00:25:08,338 --> 00:25:09,363
What the...

332
00:25:16,935 --> 00:25:18,083
Put me down!

333
00:25:45,713 --> 00:25:47,048
- <i>Did you lock this?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

334
00:25:51,481 --> 00:25:54,347
Damn it. Damn it!
Guy must have popped it.

335
00:25:54,507 --> 00:25:56,224
He's been bitchin' about money all week.

336
00:25:56,385 --> 00:25:58,178
- Think he just split?
- You surprised?

337
00:25:58,298 --> 00:26:01,188
- Guy threatened to bail twice a day.
- Let's just finish and get out of here.

338
00:26:01,348 --> 00:26:04,024
- Who tells Carter?
- You... he's your friend.

339
00:26:04,184 --> 00:26:06,210
Friend? He's just a guy I met.

340
00:26:35,381 --> 00:26:36,611
Six victims.

341
00:26:37,539 --> 00:26:40,353
Different parts of the city,
different worlds, different lives.

342
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:41,603
What's the connection?

343
00:26:41,896 --> 00:26:44,648
Greta was saying none.
Guys in the house were drug dealers.

344
00:26:44,808 --> 00:26:47,484
But there's some blood matches.
And...

345
00:26:47,644 --> 00:26:50,028
we got George here.
George Lazlo.

346
00:26:50,188 --> 00:26:51,813
And who, exactly, is this guy?

347
00:26:52,072 --> 00:26:55,283
- Actually, Jim...
- James... not Jim. James.

348
00:26:55,443 --> 00:26:57,086
Right, right, apologies.

349
00:26:57,206 --> 00:27:00,789
Before you go on, I just wanna make sure
you're aware Lazlo was cleared.

350
00:27:01,131 --> 00:27:04,209
Blood sample came back. Not a match
to the plastic surgeon's office.

351
00:27:04,369 --> 00:27:05,540
We got blood?

352
00:27:06,139 --> 00:27:08,121
- How'd we manage that?
- I...

353
00:27:08,387 --> 00:27:09,798
I finessed the samples.

354
00:27:10,287 --> 00:27:12,842
And, yes, I heard it didn't match.

355
00:27:13,546 --> 00:27:16,179
But, I've been thinking
of another possibility.

356
00:27:16,696 --> 00:27:18,890
Whoever killed Dr. Lyman
was in there for two days.

357
00:27:19,819 --> 00:27:21,817
I'm thinking there's a chance...

358
00:27:21,937 --> 00:27:24,858
our killer had himself
cut to look like Lazlo...

359
00:27:25,445 --> 00:27:26,815
forced the Doctor to operate,

360
00:27:26,975 --> 00:27:28,358
then killed him.

361
00:27:28,518 --> 00:27:30,944
Wouldn't there be scars and bruising?

362
00:27:31,104 --> 00:27:33,449
The office has a hyperbaric
oxygen system...

363
00:27:33,708 --> 00:27:36,574
which speeds healing.
And he could have used makeup.

364
00:27:36,734 --> 00:27:39,216
Actually, I considered this too.
I asked the office manager.

365
00:27:39,336 --> 00:27:41,538
Apparently they keep detailed
records of the anesthesia.

366
00:27:41,896 --> 00:27:44,233
According to their log,
the levels were unchanged.

367
00:27:44,451 --> 00:27:45,900
No one had surgery.

368
00:27:46,229 --> 00:27:47,828
No one had anesthesia.

369
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,046
There's a possibility
they just didn't use any.

370
00:27:50,206 --> 00:27:51,840
Right, I asked that too.

371
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,028
She said a job like that...
four, five hours under the knife,

372
00:27:55,148 --> 00:27:58,722
cutting that deep into the tissue
of the face, the nose, the eyes...

373
00:27:59,707 --> 00:28:02,350
You can't take that kind of pain.
It's impossible.

374
00:28:03,312 --> 00:28:05,478
You got some kind of release
from this lazlo guy, right,

375
00:28:05,638 --> 00:28:06,797
for the blood?

376
00:28:06,988 --> 00:28:08,648
Last thing we need's a lawsuit.

377
00:28:09,293 --> 00:28:11,735
So... if t isn't anything else...

378
00:28:16,358 --> 00:28:18,283
Hey... sorry, Jim.

379
00:28:18,777 --> 00:28:20,042
Facts are facts.

380
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:22,620
Sorry about that.

381
00:28:23,458 --> 00:28:25,707
But, you know, if it doesn't add up,
it just doesn't add up.

382
00:28:25,867 --> 00:28:28,535
Doesn't add up it's 'cause we
don't have all the numbers yet.

383
00:28:28,809 --> 00:28:31,573
James, nobody expects anything
from you on this.

384
00:28:31,693 --> 00:28:34,174
Your ass is suitably covered.
Why you wanna rock the boat?

385
00:28:34,496 --> 00:28:37,134
Last time I had a case where
this many things didn't add up,

386
00:28:37,339 --> 00:28:39,137
three people blew
themselves up in a bank.

387
00:28:39,827 --> 00:28:41,598
Look, I don't know, Greta.

388
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,108
I just...

389
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,937
I just feel it.

390
00:28:48,097 --> 00:28:50,273
Yeah, maybe you should
try feeling a little less.

391
00:28:50,433 --> 00:28:52,775
'Cause you're going blind.

392
00:29:02,737 --> 00:29:04,371
You can't just leave me here.

393
00:29:05,657 --> 00:29:06,873
Come on, hurry up.

394
00:29:07,214 --> 00:29:08,771
Would have been faster to kill him.

395
00:29:10,425 --> 00:29:12,003
Sometimes, you seem inefficient.

396
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:14,214
I'm not for you to understand.

397
00:29:14,374 --> 00:29:15,715
You said that before.

398
00:29:17,968 --> 00:29:19,301
I do things, you know?

399
00:29:19,462 --> 00:29:22,180
Stupid, illogical, inefficient things.

400
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,932
Humans... get used to it.

401
00:29:56,694 --> 00:29:58,624
I told the guy to just be patient.

402
00:29:58,744 --> 00:30:00,536
- Looks like he bailed.
- So he's gone then?

403
00:30:00,656 --> 00:30:03,513
Yeah, it doesn't surprise me.
Was bitching about the money all week.

404
00:30:05,264 --> 00:30:07,350
Then I wanna thank you for your service.

405
00:31:07,647 --> 00:31:08,805
This is it?

406
00:31:09,752 --> 00:31:11,283
This is depot 37?

407
00:31:12,472 --> 00:31:14,044
Did that guy lie to you?

408
00:31:14,304 --> 00:31:15,192
No...

409
00:31:15,889 --> 00:31:16,983
This is it.

410
00:31:18,499 --> 00:31:21,257
- This is where the factory will be.
- What factory?

411
00:31:21,545 --> 00:31:22,919
Where I'll be made.

412
00:31:23,895 --> 00:31:26,262
Me and many others.
Right there.

413
00:31:29,606 --> 00:31:30,918
It's inside.

414
00:31:34,944 --> 00:31:36,742
Coltan is rare in the future.

415
00:31:37,141 --> 00:31:39,307
Much of it was destroyed
when the bombs went off.

416
00:31:39,427 --> 00:31:41,569
He's stockpiling it
for after judgment day.

417
00:31:41,729 --> 00:31:43,928
It's in the bunker, where it'll be safe.

418
00:31:57,054 --> 00:31:58,545
Your gun. Give it to me now.

419
00:31:58,705 --> 00:32:01,338
I don't have a gun...
or anything. I didn't shoot anyone.

420
00:32:01,724 --> 00:32:03,132
- Your boss.
- Hey, Carter!

421
00:32:05,169 --> 00:32:07,512
Listen to me for a second.
Just for a second, all right?

422
00:32:07,704 --> 00:32:09,040
What's your name?

423
00:32:09,431 --> 00:32:11,516
- My name's John.
- What the hell are you doing here?

424
00:32:11,676 --> 00:32:14,153
I'm just looking, man.
In the wrong place at the wrong time.

425
00:32:14,273 --> 00:32:15,678
- What's your name?
- Mike.

426
00:32:15,798 --> 00:32:17,939
All right. Listen, we got a problem.

427
00:32:18,099 --> 00:32:18,898
Okay?

428
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,513
Your boss,

429
00:32:20,633 --> 00:32:21,451
he's a...

430
00:32:21,835 --> 00:32:23,270
he's a really bad guy.

431
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:25,405
All right? He killed those guys.

432
00:32:25,565 --> 00:32:27,897
And he'll kill us if he finds us.

433
00:32:28,017 --> 00:32:30,285
- So we need to get out...
- Carter? He shot them?

434
00:32:30,445 --> 00:32:32,416
Look, you've worked
with this guy, right?

435
00:32:32,536 --> 00:32:34,996
Have you noticed that
something's just off about him?

436
00:32:35,575 --> 00:32:37,750
Like he'd just kill you just because.

437
00:32:38,442 --> 00:32:40,836
So there's something wrong with him.

438
00:32:41,462 --> 00:32:42,505
You know?

439
00:32:42,665 --> 00:32:43,665
Yeah.

440
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:46,009
- Where is he?
- Don't!

441
00:32:47,793 --> 00:32:49,304
This bastard owes me my money!

442
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:53,224
I'll take my share and theirs too.

443
00:32:54,093 --> 00:32:55,727
Hey! Freak!

444
00:32:57,557 --> 00:32:58,730
I'm talkin' to you!

445
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:09,657
Look, man, just open the door.

446
00:33:12,069 --> 00:33:13,953
Thank you for your service.

447
00:33:16,491 --> 00:33:17,457
What are you?

448
00:34:05,721 --> 00:34:06,798
Oh, god, please.

449
00:34:33,188 --> 00:34:34,909
It's not your fault.

450
00:34:35,594 --> 00:34:36,661
Maybe it's yours.

451
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:39,497
Maybe if you'd have let him
try to save that girl,

452
00:34:39,657 --> 00:34:41,226
or let him think he had a choice,

453
00:34:41,346 --> 00:34:43,251
maybe he wouldn't have gone off
the reservation.

454
00:34:43,411 --> 00:34:46,087
- John does these things.
- Not the John I know.

455
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:47,714
The john I know.

456
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:51,008
- Hello? John, thank god.
- <i>Mom?</i>

457
00:34:51,168 --> 00:34:53,261
- <i>Mom.</i>
- We're right outside. You all right?

458
00:34:53,421 --> 00:34:54,345
Yeah.

459
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,264
Listen, he's blocking the door.

460
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,016
It's like he's frozen.

461
00:34:59,365 --> 00:35:00,893
He's frozen?

462
00:35:01,053 --> 00:35:02,647
Yeah, when the door shut,

463
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,981
it's like he went to sleep or something.

464
00:35:05,141 --> 00:35:06,440
Standby.

465
00:35:07,332 --> 00:35:08,810
He completed his mission.

466
00:35:09,164 --> 00:35:11,946
He powered down to standby mode
until he's moved or triggered awake.

467
00:35:12,106 --> 00:35:13,072
Triggered?

468
00:35:16,852 --> 00:35:17,905
The door.

469
00:35:18,588 --> 00:35:20,121
They put him into standby.

470
00:35:20,281 --> 00:35:21,205
15 seconds.

471
00:35:22,733 --> 00:35:23,750
The reboot time.

472
00:35:24,012 --> 00:35:26,169
John, listen to me.
This is what I want you to do.

473
00:35:26,868 --> 00:35:28,604
I want you to open that door.

474
00:35:28,956 --> 00:35:29,943
And run.

475
00:35:30,325 --> 00:35:32,091
The instant that door
cracks open, you run.

476
00:35:41,154 --> 00:35:42,059
John?

477
00:35:43,737 --> 00:35:44,872
Yeah, I run.

478
00:35:53,548 --> 00:35:56,257
So what do you think
future john would do right now?

479
00:35:56,858 --> 00:35:57,979
We'll see.

480
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:35,172
John.

481
00:37:41,412 --> 00:37:42,232
Come on!

482
00:37:55,561 --> 00:37:58,237
- I thought you said you could drive.
- It's jammed or something.

483
00:37:58,397 --> 00:37:59,572
Step on the clutch.

484
00:38:05,133 --> 00:38:06,133
Hard!

485
00:38:30,346 --> 00:38:33,689
If you're gonna be a hero,
you gotta learn how to drive a stick.

486
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:22,405
- Let's go.
- But can he get out?

487
00:39:26,569 --> 00:39:27,697
Drive.

488
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,134
Mr. Lazlo.

489
00:39:44,587 --> 00:39:45,991
May I come in?

490
00:39:48,492 --> 00:39:49,695
Thank you.

491
00:39:55,055 --> 00:39:56,063
Pepperoni?

492
00:39:57,158 --> 00:39:58,589
I love those things.

493
00:40:00,447 --> 00:40:02,611
My bosses told me
i should stay clear of you.

494
00:40:04,015 --> 00:40:05,299
For legal reasons.

495
00:40:05,969 --> 00:40:06,907
I understand.

496
00:40:07,067 --> 00:40:09,251
But I thought I owed it to you
to drop by.

497
00:40:09,468 --> 00:40:11,203
- Give you a warning.
- A warning?

498
00:40:11,363 --> 00:40:12,784
Well, there's a chance--

499
00:40:12,989 --> 00:40:15,380
a small chance, but a chance...

500
00:40:15,804 --> 00:40:18,743
that there's someone out there who
might be trying to steal your identity.

501
00:40:18,913 --> 00:40:20,601
Steal my identity?

502
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,340
What for?

503
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,628
What do people do
with anything these days?

504
00:40:26,025 --> 00:40:27,053
Steal, cheat,

505
00:40:27,323 --> 00:40:29,114
harm, and intimidate others.

506
00:40:29,234 --> 00:40:31,191
Damage the national psyche.

507
00:40:32,419 --> 00:40:33,573
Anyway...

508
00:40:34,032 --> 00:40:36,547
if you see or hear anything unusual,

509
00:40:36,889 --> 00:40:38,522
call me, anytime.

510
00:40:40,866 --> 00:40:42,437
Thank you for your help.

511
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:45,654
Sure.

512
00:40:49,271 --> 00:40:50,529
Have a nice day.

513
00:40:54,141 --> 00:40:55,539
Have a nice day.

514
00:40:56,219 --> 00:40:58,709
<i>Not every version
of the Golem story ends badly.</i>

515
00:40:59,325 --> 00:41:02,463
<i>In one, the monster is a hero,
destroying all those that seek</i>

516
00:41:02,623 --> 00:41:03,839
<i>to harm its maker.</i>

<i>In another, the Golem's maker</i>

518
00:41:10,465 --> 00:41:13,182
<i>destroys his creature

519
00:41:40,361 --> 00:41:41,627
You okay?

520
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:43,087
I'm fine.

521
00:41:45,854 --> 00:41:46,891
Really.

522
00:41:48,327 --> 00:41:50,052
How many times
we gonna have this talk?

523
00:41:51,434 --> 00:41:52,763
A lot, I think.

524
00:42:12,026 --> 00:42:14,013
I should go finish my homework.

525
00:42:19,874 --> 00:42:22,251
<i>The pride of man, of parents as well,</i>

526
00:42:23,546 --> 00:42:27,004

527
00:42:29,123 --> 00:42:31,267
<i>Whether from clay or from metal,</i>

528
00:42:31,651 --> 00:42:34,658
<i>it is in the nature of us

<i>Our children are alloys, all,</i>

530
00:42:37,637 --> 00:42:39,827
