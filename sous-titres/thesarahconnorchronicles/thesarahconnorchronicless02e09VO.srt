<i>Previously on</i> Terminator:
The Sarah Connor Chronicles...

2
00:00:03,144 --> 00:00:06,323
Dr. Boyd Sherman,
child psychologist, family therapist.

3
00:00:06,448 --> 00:00:08,383
What's his link to Skynet...
Friend or foe?

4
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:10,343
- Jesse.
- Hey, baby.

5
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:14,221
Are you AWOL?
Jesse, did you run from the war?

6
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:15,765
I need a place to rest.

7
00:00:21,086 --> 00:00:22,146
What's next?

8
00:00:22,472 --> 00:00:23,606
We'll come back

9
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:25,941
and bring something with us
to destroy it.

10
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,420
I'm gonna be sick.

11
00:01:32,419 --> 00:01:34,677
- What's wrong with her?
- I don't know.

12
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:36,762
- She's burning up.
- I'm fine.

13
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:39,818
Is she pregnant?

14
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,475
Why in the hell
would you even ask that?

15
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,147
Kacy vomited when she was pregnant.

16
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:47,898
You're vomiting.
It's morning.

17
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,226
- That's when it happens.
- Just shut up.

18
00:01:50,351 --> 00:01:52,257
It's a bug or something.

19
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,242
Stomach flu or something.

20
00:02:01,003 --> 00:02:02,805
We'll be home soon, okay?

21
00:02:03,471 --> 00:02:04,473
Here.

22
00:02:06,872 --> 00:02:07,873
Wait.

23
00:02:45,483 --> 00:02:47,101
How do you feel?

24
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,084
How do I look?

25
00:02:50,501 --> 00:02:51,504
Like crap.

26
00:02:57,854 --> 00:02:59,428
I wish I felt that good.

27
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:06,645
- What's that?
- It's rehydration fluid.

28
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,814
Drink one cup every half hour
or right after you vomit.

29
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,697
Where are you going?

30
00:03:16,607 --> 00:03:17,940
We have to go back now.

31
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:19,573
- Back where?
- Mexico.

32
00:03:20,014 --> 00:03:23,202
There's thermite in the garage.
We need to burn Cromartie's body.

33
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,369
Cromartie's dead.

34
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,747
You have to incinerate him, John.
To be sure.

35
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:30,236
He's buried in the middle of a desert,
and his chip has been obliterated.

36
00:03:30,361 --> 00:03:33,546
- I think we're pretty...
- Safe? It's not safe.

37
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,924
Oh, God,
she's starting to sound like you.

38
00:03:37,845 --> 00:03:38,947
She's right.

39
00:03:49,397 --> 00:03:50,688
I need to see you. Now.

40
00:03:51,626 --> 00:03:52,728
<i>Bring a gun.</i>

41
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:02,658
I was over at the shopping mall
this morning, right? And I just...

42
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:05,759
I don't know.
I can't stop eating Chinese food.

43
00:04:05,884 --> 00:04:08,414
So I'm there,
and I'm just waiting for my food,

44
00:04:08,994 --> 00:04:11,596
and I look across the way,
and I see him.

45
00:04:11,966 --> 00:04:13,267
I just see him.

46
00:04:13,858 --> 00:04:15,045
You see him who?

47
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:17,882
Fischer.
I see Fischer.

48
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:21,760
- Who's Fischer?
- Charles Fischer.

49
00:04:22,645 --> 00:04:24,555
I don't know
who you're talking about.

50
00:04:25,299 --> 00:04:27,094
You do. You know him.

51
00:04:29,184 --> 00:04:31,812
Charles Fischer,
sent back from the future,

52
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,080
and he works for the machines.

53
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,233
And he's gonna die.

54
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:55,753
- What are you doing?
- Feeling what it's like to get away.

55
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,503
I don't think you are.

56
00:04:57,913 --> 00:05:00,338
- What do you mean?
- If by feelings you mean emotions,

57
00:05:00,463 --> 00:05:03,254
I'm pretty sure
you still don't have any of those.

58
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:05,716
And if by feeling
you mean what it feels like

59
00:05:05,841 --> 00:05:09,245
to have the wind
blow through your toes or your hair...

60
00:05:11,641 --> 00:05:14,125
I'm pretty sure
you can't feel that either.

61
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,050
I don't think you understand
how we work.

62
00:05:19,267 --> 00:05:20,669
I have sensation.

63
00:05:21,316 --> 00:05:22,320
I feel.

64
00:05:25,935 --> 00:05:28,369
I wouldn't be worth much
if I couldn't feel.

65
00:05:41,515 --> 00:05:44,089
- So go through this again.
- I've gone through it again.

66
00:05:44,214 --> 00:05:45,803
- One more time.
- I told you.

67
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:49,139
- I'm at the mall...
- Just skip to where you follow this man

68
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,266
to the parking garage
and hit him with a brick.

69
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,685
He's a Grey.
Tell me you remember the Greys.

70
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,957
Of course I remember the Greys.

71
00:05:56,965 --> 00:05:59,619
They were traitors.
They worked for Skynet.

72
00:05:59,744 --> 00:06:02,281
- Helped the trip-eights act more human.
- You don't remember him?

73
00:06:04,056 --> 00:06:06,058
He was on the top of the list.

74
00:06:08,395 --> 00:06:09,396
Tell him!

75
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,095
Tell him who you are
and why you're here!

76
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,156
I don't know
what you're talking about.

77
00:06:14,281 --> 00:06:16,249
My name is Paul Stewart.
That's my license.

78
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:19,545
Look at my license. Please.
I'm not who she says I am!

79
00:06:19,716 --> 00:06:21,918
- Liar!
- It's a mistake!

80
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:29,436
For your sake, brother,
I hope you're right.

83
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:38,855
I told you.

84
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,932
I repair watches.
I have a shop in Pasadena.

85
00:06:44,057 --> 00:06:45,278
That's my license.

86
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:49,169
What are you doing here, Fischer?

87
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:55,538
I was looking for an Omega.
321 movement.

88
00:06:55,663 --> 00:06:57,549
There's a secondhand store.

89
00:07:01,102 --> 00:07:03,756
Tin cans didn't send him back here
to fix watches.

90
00:07:04,349 --> 00:07:05,758
I think we all know that.

91
00:07:06,923 --> 00:07:10,327
Why don't you save us the trouble
and tell us the truth?

92
00:07:11,653 --> 00:07:13,161
Why are you here?

93
00:07:13,286 --> 00:07:15,434
I'm Paul Stewart,
I live on Blackburn Avenue.

94
00:07:15,603 --> 00:07:16,769
Your name is Fischer.

95
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,646
- You work for Skynet.
- Skynet? No.

96
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,982
What are you doing here,
you murdering bastard!

97
00:07:32,907 --> 00:07:33,911
Do I know you?

98
00:07:36,432 --> 00:07:38,441
No, you don't know me,

99
00:07:38,566 --> 00:07:41,119
and I don't know her. I don't.

100
00:07:42,407 --> 00:07:45,761
For the love of God,
I'm not Charles Fischer.

101
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:47,594
I'm not.

102
00:08:02,326 --> 00:08:03,992
- I need you to be sure.
- Of what?

103
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:05,275
- Him.
- I am sure.

104
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,652
You don't trust me?

105
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,109
It's not that I don't trust you.
It's...

106
00:08:10,154 --> 00:08:13,245
I knew the Greys.
Jesse, I knew them just like you did.

107
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:15,326
They were war criminals.
We caught four of them?

108
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:19,302
Right, but we couldn't find Fischer.
They kept him hidden. Too valuable.

109
00:08:21,576 --> 00:08:23,150
You really don't remember?

110
00:08:23,275 --> 00:08:25,102
Listen, if he is who you say he is,

111
00:08:25,227 --> 00:08:27,768
then he deserves whatever is gonna
happen to him in that room,

112
00:08:27,893 --> 00:08:31,599
but not until he tells us who he is
and what he's doing here.

113
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:34,685
Do you understand?

114
00:08:35,123 --> 00:08:37,520
- He is who I say he is.
- I want to hear him say it.

115
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,188
He will.

116
00:08:46,127 --> 00:08:47,328
I'll show you.

117
00:11:18,941 --> 00:11:21,661
- Where's the rest of him?
- It's not here.

118
00:11:21,786 --> 00:11:23,552
Not possible.
We destroyed his chip.

119
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,108
He didn't walk out of here,
but he's gone.

120
00:11:31,122 --> 00:11:33,487
There's only one other person
who knew about this.

121
00:11:33,647 --> 00:11:37,118
And only one other person
crazy enough to dig him up.

122
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:00,999
You hungry?

123
00:12:04,813 --> 00:12:05,923
Not hungry.

124
00:12:06,122 --> 00:12:07,480
You a vegetarian?

125
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,117
No, I just... I don't know
what's in that.

126
00:12:16,398 --> 00:12:17,782
Cheeseburger's in that.

127
00:12:19,312 --> 00:12:20,035
Eat.

128
00:12:21,813 --> 00:12:23,284
Where's your friend?

129
00:12:24,088 --> 00:12:24,811
Out.

130
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,092
I'm not who she thinks I am.

131
00:12:36,614 --> 00:12:37,834
I sure hope not.

132
00:12:38,526 --> 00:12:39,897
I fix watches.

133
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,136
I used to be an engineer,

134
00:12:48,328 --> 00:12:49,983
but it got old.

135
00:12:51,752 --> 00:12:53,915
I was just a guy in a cubicle

136
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:57,031
with a bunch of other guys
in cubicles,

137
00:12:58,341 --> 00:13:00,795
so I decided to go to Bern
to learn...

138
00:13:01,127 --> 00:13:02,417
watch repair.

139
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:05,453
It's in Switzerland.
You ever been to Switzerland?

140
00:13:06,764 --> 00:13:08,285
That's a nice story.

141
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:14,717
You don't believe me.

142
00:13:15,349 --> 00:13:16,915
I've told a few myself.

143
00:13:20,601 --> 00:13:24,223
Is she your girlfriend,
this woman?

144
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:26,762
Do you love her?

145
00:13:28,323 --> 00:13:29,728
It's complicated.

146
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:34,591
Well, I know complication.
I'm a watchmaker.

147
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,970
It's a...
It's a watch joke.

148
00:13:43,451 --> 00:13:44,910
If I were you, I'd eat.

149
00:13:46,157 --> 00:13:47,312
Listen to me.

150
00:13:47,937 --> 00:13:50,751
People do crazy things
when they're in love.

151
00:13:51,037 --> 00:13:52,347
Well, I do.

152
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,586
But this is insane.

153
00:13:55,311 --> 00:13:56,899
She says that you know me,

154
00:13:57,024 --> 00:14:00,051
and clearly
you don't know me.

155
00:14:00,864 --> 00:14:02,585
There's something wrong with her.

156
00:14:17,395 --> 00:14:19,186
So what'd they get you for?

157
00:14:19,311 --> 00:14:21,030
Did you hear what I just said?

158
00:14:21,707 --> 00:14:22,937
It's prison ink.

159
00:14:24,452 --> 00:14:28,034
- Where'd you do time?
- I haven't done any time.

160
00:14:28,614 --> 00:14:29,868
Yes, you have.

161
00:14:30,812 --> 00:14:32,860
No, it's a ta...
It's a tattoo,

162
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:36,289
'cause I fi...
I fix watches.

163
00:14:36,414 --> 00:14:37,724
It's a clock.

164
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,376
With no hands.

165
00:14:44,171 --> 00:14:46,529
It means till the end of time.

166
00:14:48,252 --> 00:14:49,183
Life sentence.

167
00:14:50,936 --> 00:14:53,646
If I had a life sentence,
what would I be doing here?

168
00:14:57,244 --> 00:14:58,943
That's what I'm trying
to figure out.

169
00:15:06,127 --> 00:15:07,312
Lunch is over.

170
00:15:37,426 --> 00:15:39,251
- Hello?
- Hey. It's Derek.

171
00:15:39,435 --> 00:15:40,765
- Is it?
- Yeah, I know.

172
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:43,821
Shocks the hell out of me, too.
Listen, I need to talk...

173
00:15:51,811 --> 00:15:52,549
Hello?

174
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:56,856
I need to talk to you.

175
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,915
- <i>So talk.</i>
- I'm sending a picture to your phone.

176
00:16:06,661 --> 00:16:07,421
I got it.

177
00:16:07,546 --> 00:16:09,497
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

178
00:16:09,622 --> 00:16:11,141
You've never seen him?

179
00:16:11,715 --> 00:16:13,459
He's not in your memory banks
or whatever?

180
00:16:13,584 --> 00:16:15,173
<i>There's no record of him?</i>

181
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,870
No.
Who is he?

182
00:16:21,825 --> 00:16:22,774
He's...

183
00:16:24,032 --> 00:16:25,909
He's just this guy.
I thought maybe I knew him.

184
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,114
He looks hurt.

185
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:29,841
Don't worry about it.

186
00:16:32,357 --> 00:16:34,121
- Who was that?
- Derek.

187
00:16:35,256 --> 00:16:36,185
Derek.

188
00:16:36,737 --> 00:16:38,880
What'd he say?
Is everything okay? Is mom okay?

189
00:16:39,005 --> 00:16:40,255
Everything's okay.

190
00:16:41,412 --> 00:16:42,843
Don't worry about it.

191
00:16:47,782 --> 00:16:48,802
Can I help you?

192
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,305
I was waiting.

193
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:52,875
I heard...

194
00:16:54,376 --> 00:16:56,809
- Do you remember me?
- Of course I remember you.

195
00:16:56,934 --> 00:16:57,723
I have...

196
00:17:00,339 --> 00:17:02,475
It's possible I have an emergency.

197
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,560
You came to my office
over a month ago,

198
00:17:04,685 --> 00:17:07,411
and you said your son needed help...
Therapy.

199
00:17:08,275 --> 00:17:10,307
I never saw either of you again.

200
00:17:12,248 --> 00:17:15,846
Wait. Dr. Sherman, please.
I've had some bad luck with shrinks.

201
00:17:16,465 --> 00:17:18,451
Well, you could stop calling
them shrinks...

202
00:17:18,576 --> 00:17:19,917
That might help.

203
00:17:20,077 --> 00:17:21,460
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

204
00:17:22,093 --> 00:17:24,497
My assistant will be here
tomorrow morning at 7:00.

205
00:17:24,622 --> 00:17:26,507
- Make an appointment.
- I'm here now.

206
00:17:26,975 --> 00:17:29,093
Sarah, make an appointment, please.

207
00:17:29,686 --> 00:17:31,387
We'll see what we can do.

208
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:33,920
I've been sick...

209
00:17:35,435 --> 00:17:36,558
Flu or something.

210
00:17:37,441 --> 00:17:40,689
I'm exhausted. I can't sleep,
and when I do, I have dreams.

211
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:44,811
Nightmares, actually.
I walk in my sleep.

212
00:17:46,876 --> 00:17:48,547
Where are you walking to?

213
00:17:50,587 --> 00:17:52,950
- What do you mean?
- I mean, where do you go when you walk?

214
00:17:54,184 --> 00:17:56,494
I'm chasing someone,
or I'm being chased.

215
00:17:56,619 --> 00:17:58,035
But where do you go?

216
00:18:03,037 --> 00:18:03,820
Out.

217
00:18:05,181 --> 00:18:06,536
I get the hell out.

218
00:18:10,776 --> 00:18:12,432
You're here.
Come on in.

219
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,384
There are many things
I don't understand.

220
00:18:23,933 --> 00:18:24,933
Like what?

221
00:18:26,964 --> 00:18:28,152
The tortoise.

222
00:18:30,312 --> 00:18:31,375
What tortoise?

223
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,444
It was on its back
by the side of the road in Mexico.

224
00:18:34,934 --> 00:18:36,577
Your mother turned it over.

225
00:18:36,746 --> 00:18:38,112
She was helping it.

226
00:18:38,489 --> 00:18:40,356
I know.
But why?

227
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:45,310
'Cause that's what we do.

228
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:48,559
When we...

229
00:18:50,489 --> 00:18:51,777
When we see something

230
00:18:51,902 --> 00:18:56,313
that's in pain, or in trouble,
or whatever, we try and help it.

231
00:18:57,071 --> 00:18:58,056
Empathy.

232
00:18:58,726 --> 00:19:00,051
Something like that.

233
00:19:00,812 --> 00:19:03,270
But not everyone
would turn the tortoise over.

234
00:19:03,589 --> 00:19:04,312
No.

235
00:19:06,751 --> 00:19:08,442
Some would just leave it there.

236
00:19:09,036 --> 00:19:11,779
Some would probably drive
over it and crush it.

237
00:19:13,248 --> 00:19:14,844
Yeah, I guess they would.

238
00:19:16,385 --> 00:19:17,860
Is that what you'd do?

239
00:19:22,907 --> 00:19:25,090
It didn't seem
like much of a threat.

240
00:19:26,267 --> 00:19:28,043
We're not built to be cruel.

241
00:19:28,852 --> 00:19:30,674
Yeah, that's one for cyborgs.

242
00:19:32,811 --> 00:19:33,574
Yes.

243
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:39,306
That's one for us.

244
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:02,037
- What are you doing?
- The body is gone.

245
00:20:02,528 --> 00:20:04,706
- What?
- Cromartie's body is gone.

246
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,542
Impossible.

247
00:20:06,702 --> 00:20:08,643
You are the only one
who knew where we buried it.

248
00:20:08,768 --> 00:20:10,816
We need it.
We have to destroy it.

249
00:20:10,941 --> 00:20:12,881
What would I possibly want with it?

250
00:20:20,033 --> 00:20:22,383
- He's lying.
- You don't know that.

251
00:20:30,269 --> 00:20:31,506
Please, John.

252
00:20:32,562 --> 00:20:34,610
If you know,
you better tell me right now.

253
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,195
I don't know.

254
00:20:40,592 --> 00:20:41,980
I don't know.

255
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:45,789
Let him go.

256
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,082
- Why?
- He's telling the truth.

257
00:20:48,243 --> 00:20:50,419
- We could find out for certain.
- Let him go.

258
00:20:59,619 --> 00:21:00,619
Sorry.

259
00:21:53,183 --> 00:21:54,397
What the hell?

260
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,692
He doesn't wanna tell us who he is.

261
00:21:57,471 --> 00:21:59,571
- I brought proof.
- Proof?

262
00:22:26,122 --> 00:22:27,682
Please, please don't hurt me.

263
00:22:27,873 --> 00:22:30,133
- Don't hurt me, please.
- That's up to him.

264
00:22:30,258 --> 00:22:32,180
- Who's he?
- Who are you?

265
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:35,971
My name is Charlie Fischer.
You were at my job...

266
00:22:36,811 --> 00:22:39,151
SRF.
We do seismic retrofitting.

267
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:42,154
I'm a service technician.
That's all. I'm nobody.

268
00:22:43,685 --> 00:22:46,033
I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

269
00:22:46,684 --> 00:22:48,234
Tell him who you are.

270
00:22:52,061 --> 00:22:54,324
I've already told you who I am.

271
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:56,565
This is a trick,

272
00:22:57,156 --> 00:22:58,685
some crazy trick,

273
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,548
and you're all in on it,
and you too.

274
00:23:01,877 --> 00:23:05,303
What do you want from me?!

275
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:16,847
I want you...

276
00:23:17,184 --> 00:23:18,497
to tell me...

277
00:23:18,728 --> 00:23:20,735
- the truth!
- Oh, God!

278
00:23:28,498 --> 00:23:30,244
If he is who you say he is...

279
00:23:30,406 --> 00:23:32,656
- He is!
- All right, fine. He is.

280
00:23:34,126 --> 00:23:36,083
We need to know
what he's doing here.

281
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:39,920
- Unless he's AWOL, like you.
- He's not.

282
00:23:40,687 --> 00:23:42,837
Not this guy, not Charles Fischer.

283
00:23:43,627 --> 00:23:45,052
He's been sent back

284
00:23:45,212 --> 00:23:47,444
by them for a reason.

285
00:23:51,627 --> 00:23:53,977
You need to beat
the hell out of him.

286
00:23:55,938 --> 00:23:57,788
You need to get him to talk.

287
00:24:30,364 --> 00:24:31,450
No, please.

288
00:24:34,386 --> 00:24:36,228
I'm sorry, really.

289
00:24:40,128 --> 00:24:41,658
Don't hurt the boy.

290
00:24:41,892 --> 00:24:42,896
Don't...

291
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,067
Some people,

292
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:49,282
you can beat them and beat them,
and they'll take it.

293
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:51,785
Whatever pain you give them,

294
00:24:51,982 --> 00:24:53,246
they absorb it,

295
00:24:54,472 --> 00:24:57,374
like it was theirs all along,
and you're giving it back to them.

296
00:25:00,252 --> 00:25:03,640
You see, deep down,
they hate themselves,

297
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:05,703
and they use that hate

298
00:25:06,102 --> 00:25:07,926
to eat the pain.

299
00:25:10,349 --> 00:25:12,294
See, we were all good once.

300
00:25:13,324 --> 00:25:15,892
We all loved ourselves once,

301
00:25:16,361 --> 00:25:18,228
as young men

302
00:25:18,389 --> 00:25:20,396
trying to get through the day,
or as kids

303
00:25:22,678 --> 00:25:24,176
playing in the park.

304
00:25:30,443 --> 00:25:32,158
Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it.

305
00:25:35,766 --> 00:25:37,663
My name is Charles Fischer.

306
00:25:46,487 --> 00:25:47,756
I'm Charles Fischer.

307
00:25:48,646 --> 00:25:50,975
Now let him go.
He's got nothing to do with this.

308
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,179
Just let him go.

309
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,795
This is impossible!

310
00:25:54,194 --> 00:25:56,057
Can't you people see
that this is insane?

311
00:26:04,321 --> 00:26:05,671
Why are you here?

312
00:26:06,884 --> 00:26:09,681
- Why did they send you back?
- They didn't.

313
00:26:10,445 --> 00:26:12,195
I'm not here on a mission.

314
00:26:12,442 --> 00:26:14,116
Nobody comes back without a mission.

315
00:26:15,009 --> 00:26:16,537
This is my reward.

316
00:26:19,573 --> 00:26:22,823
When the bombs dropped,
I was locked up in Pelican Bay.

317
00:26:23,757 --> 00:26:25,307
Solitary confinement.

318
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,158
Life sentence.

319
00:26:34,351 --> 00:26:36,235
If I hadn't been in prison,

320
00:26:37,073 --> 00:26:39,792
I never would've made it
through Judgment Day.

321
00:26:39,943 --> 00:26:41,947
Once they got their hands on me,

322
00:26:42,072 --> 00:26:43,822
it was either I teach them

323
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,441
everything I learned inside

324
00:26:47,892 --> 00:26:49,134
or say good-bye.

325
00:26:50,068 --> 00:26:51,528
And what'd you learn?

326
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:55,663
I learned what makes people tick.

327
00:27:06,697 --> 00:27:10,012
So the fever
that brought on the dreams

328
00:27:10,697 --> 00:27:13,736
was caused by something you ate,
you think, in Mexico.

329
00:27:15,503 --> 00:27:18,075
- What were you doing in Mexico?
- Vacation.

330
00:27:18,474 --> 00:27:19,793
Family vacation?

331
00:27:23,447 --> 00:27:26,097
Has anything happened
since I saw you last?

332
00:27:28,888 --> 00:27:32,259
- What do you mean?
- I mean, have you suffered a trauma?

333
00:27:32,785 --> 00:27:35,475
Has there been a crisis in the family,
something more

334
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,617
between you and John
since I've seen you last?

335
00:27:37,913 --> 00:27:40,551
I came to you for help
in understanding my dreams.

336
00:27:40,676 --> 00:27:43,848
Well, the problem is, without
knowing the details of your life,

337
00:27:43,973 --> 00:27:47,669
I'm not sure what I can tell you,
beyond generalities.

338
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,317
I can tell you
that dreams tend to mirror

339
00:27:52,442 --> 00:27:54,710
the central conflict in the dreamer.

340
00:27:55,886 --> 00:27:57,514
Would it be accurate to say

341
00:27:57,639 --> 00:27:59,848
that the central conflict
in your life is your son?

342
00:28:02,719 --> 00:28:04,852
And your daughter,
you have less conflict with.

343
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:09,403
- It's different with her.
- What is?

344
00:28:09,684 --> 00:28:11,561
Conflict, type of conflict,

345
00:28:11,973 --> 00:28:13,736
the nature
of your relationship, what?

346
00:28:14,202 --> 00:28:16,013
- Everything.
- Specifically.

347
00:28:16,138 --> 00:28:18,188
I don't want to talk about her.

348
00:28:19,355 --> 00:28:20,617
Then why are you here?

349
00:28:21,906 --> 00:28:23,557
I mean, you come in here

350
00:28:23,682 --> 00:28:26,472
pretending to want to talk
about your dreams,

351
00:28:27,094 --> 00:28:29,376
and refusing to talk
about John and Cameron,

352
00:28:29,825 --> 00:28:31,138
which, in my opinion,

353
00:28:31,263 --> 00:28:34,613
is what your obsession
with the three dots is all about.

354
00:28:34,929 --> 00:28:38,101
So if you only want to talk about
one of those dots,

355
00:28:38,577 --> 00:28:40,327
there's not much I can do.

356
00:28:43,453 --> 00:28:45,403
I have no one else to talk to.

357
00:29:03,577 --> 00:29:06,789
Nothing is going to happen in here
until you decide to be honest.

358
00:29:21,354 --> 00:29:22,638
You seem surprised.

359
00:29:23,705 --> 00:29:24,983
Judgment Day...

360
00:29:26,328 --> 00:29:27,416
Machines...

361
00:29:28,103 --> 00:29:29,646
You have no idea what you'd do.

362
00:29:31,554 --> 00:29:34,792
What's the hardest decision
you've ever had to make?

363
00:29:38,019 --> 00:29:39,869
Whether to stay with Rebecca

364
00:29:40,063 --> 00:29:42,056
or take a chance on Christine?

365
00:29:42,891 --> 00:29:46,081
Whether to ask for time off
for grandfather's funeral

366
00:29:46,866 --> 00:29:50,249
because you're too afraid
you'll be fired if you just take it?

367
00:29:51,567 --> 00:29:53,931
You think you know who you are?

368
00:29:55,083 --> 00:29:57,066
You don't have a clue.

369
00:30:00,185 --> 00:30:02,906
Can't you just tell them
what they want to know?

370
00:30:04,501 --> 00:30:06,232
What does it matter now?

371
00:30:06,974 --> 00:30:08,885
You're here. You're safe.

372
00:30:09,395 --> 00:30:10,395
Are you?

373
00:30:17,393 --> 00:30:19,309
No, he's playing with us,

374
00:30:19,434 --> 00:30:21,137
he's making us think he's weak.

375
00:30:21,262 --> 00:30:22,939
- He's not weak.
- How do you know?

376
00:30:23,064 --> 00:30:24,635
I know, all right?

377
00:30:25,018 --> 00:30:26,018
I know.

378
00:30:26,143 --> 00:30:28,572
You may not remember, but I know.

379
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:31,540
He is the worst of them.
He's the worst.

380
00:30:32,268 --> 00:30:33,418
He needs to die.

381
00:30:33,705 --> 00:30:35,043
Forget why he's here.

382
00:30:35,431 --> 00:30:37,576
Forget whatever the mission is.

383
00:30:37,892 --> 00:30:39,256
He just needs to die.

384
00:30:39,893 --> 00:30:40,924
What did he do?

385
00:30:42,234 --> 00:30:44,145
Jess, what did he do to you?

386
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,990
There was a raid on a bunker.

387
00:30:47,771 --> 00:30:49,321
Metal was everywhere.

388
00:30:49,833 --> 00:30:51,268
They took out our command,

389
00:30:51,832 --> 00:30:54,354
killed everyone over 30,
killed the children.

390
00:30:58,582 --> 00:31:01,032
They took the prisoners
to this place.

391
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:03,864
He was there.

392
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:17,836
He said he was gonna teach them
how to talk to people,

393
00:31:18,316 --> 00:31:20,715
how to get information from people,

394
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:22,467
how to be people.

395
00:31:33,575 --> 00:31:37,206
It was a kind of
perverse theater, like...

396
00:31:38,763 --> 00:31:40,513
like he was teaching them.

397
00:31:42,763 --> 00:31:44,313
How long did it go on?

398
00:31:44,863 --> 00:31:45,697
Weeks.

399
00:31:46,764 --> 00:31:47,764
Months.

400
00:31:51,139 --> 00:31:52,589
There were drugs...

401
00:31:53,636 --> 00:31:54,886
and starvation.

402
00:31:55,969 --> 00:31:57,663
And he talked to you...

403
00:31:59,062 --> 00:32:00,251
for hours...

404
00:32:00,889 --> 00:32:02,090
for days...

405
00:32:03,982 --> 00:32:05,659
Just to break you down,

406
00:32:06,181 --> 00:32:07,996
just to get to your in...

407
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:11,900
to get to you.

408
00:32:19,735 --> 00:32:21,137
How'd you get out?

409
00:32:21,343 --> 00:32:22,525
I don't know.

410
00:32:24,285 --> 00:32:25,990
You never told me.

411
00:32:26,677 --> 00:32:27,735
What?

412
00:32:34,025 --> 00:32:36,381
It wasn't me Fischer had, baby.

413
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:40,525
It was you.

414
00:32:56,477 --> 00:32:57,590
Go to hell.

415
00:33:00,711 --> 00:33:02,195
You don't remember.

416
00:33:05,367 --> 00:33:07,617
I can't believe you don't remember.

417
00:33:10,168 --> 00:33:11,494
But it was you.

418
00:33:21,893 --> 00:33:23,170
My name is Derek Reese,

419
00:33:23,635 --> 00:33:25,380
first lieutenant, 132nd SOC.

420
00:33:25,541 --> 00:33:28,191
- Yeah, well, good for you.
- Not for you.

421
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:32,013
- I told you I'm not on a mission.
- I don't care.

422
00:33:34,301 --> 00:33:36,697
You remember.
You remember now.

423
00:33:36,971 --> 00:33:38,977
I was wondering how long
that was gonna take.

424
00:33:39,254 --> 00:33:41,412
No, I don't remember.

425
00:33:41,825 --> 00:33:42,975
But she does,

426
00:33:44,339 --> 00:33:46,346
and that's good enough for me.

427
00:33:49,178 --> 00:33:50,615
You gonna kill me?

428
00:33:54,956 --> 00:33:55,956
Not you.

429
00:34:00,994 --> 00:34:02,543
Oh, God. Thank you.

430
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:24,334
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to wake you.

431
00:34:24,459 --> 00:34:25,565
I wasn't sleeping.

432
00:34:26,202 --> 00:34:28,319
Just needed to close my eyes
for a few minutes.

433
00:34:30,231 --> 00:34:31,521
How you feeling?

434
00:34:37,571 --> 00:34:39,435
What does this mean to you?

435
00:34:46,162 --> 00:34:49,344
I keep seeing it in my dreams, John.
It means something.

436
00:34:52,709 --> 00:34:55,059
Mom, you're tired.
You've been sick.

437
00:34:55,396 --> 00:34:58,046
Chasing killer robots
will do that to you.

438
00:34:59,281 --> 00:35:01,482
We couldn't find Cromartie's body.

439
00:35:02,636 --> 00:35:04,020
It wasn't there. It's gone.

440
00:35:06,084 --> 00:35:08,067
- He doesn't have it.
- Are you sure?

441
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:10,770
I'm sure.

442
00:35:13,179 --> 00:35:16,408
Cromartie was in my dreams.
It's connected. It's all connected.

443
00:35:16,753 --> 00:35:18,243
Mom, you had a dream.

444
00:35:21,147 --> 00:35:22,567
It was my fault.

445
00:35:24,381 --> 00:35:25,784
What was your fault?

446
00:35:26,586 --> 00:35:28,636
Cromartie... I led him to you.

447
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,935
What are you talking about?

448
00:35:33,712 --> 00:35:37,633
There was this kid, a boy...
in the bowling alley.

449
00:35:37,758 --> 00:35:41,284
He was with the guys
who broke into our house, and I sh...

450
00:35:45,077 --> 00:35:47,606
I knew what I had to do, John.
I didn't do it. I let him go.

451
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,310
Cromartie must've found him.

452
00:35:53,971 --> 00:35:55,510
We're not murderers.

453
00:35:58,810 --> 00:35:59,868
You're not.

454
00:36:03,588 --> 00:36:05,138
Tell that to the boy.

455
00:36:06,773 --> 00:36:08,223
I'm sure he's dead.

456
00:36:12,776 --> 00:36:14,826
We have to find that body, John.

457
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:41,420
You don't think he'll...

458
00:36:41,633 --> 00:36:42,646
talk...

459
00:36:43,456 --> 00:36:44,705
Young Fischer.

460
00:36:44,866 --> 00:36:46,459
We had to let him go.

461
00:36:48,207 --> 00:36:50,126
He's not the monster we just buried.

462
00:36:50,513 --> 00:36:52,732
Let's hope he doesn't become one.

463
00:36:55,393 --> 00:36:57,207
Do you remember any of it?

464
00:36:59,063 --> 00:37:00,357
Even a flash?

465
00:37:04,933 --> 00:37:05,768
Nothing.

466
00:37:07,297 --> 00:37:09,584
It was all we talked about, Derek...

467
00:37:11,209 --> 00:37:12,459
What he'd done,

468
00:37:13,206 --> 00:37:15,456
how you were gonna find him one day.

469
00:37:16,708 --> 00:37:18,058
You were obsessed.

470
00:37:23,475 --> 00:37:25,832
It was a trauma.
You've blocked it.

471
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:29,619
Maybe, maybe not.

472
00:37:35,022 --> 00:37:36,904
Maybe it never happened to me.

473
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,314
I was there.

474
00:37:44,836 --> 00:37:47,273
Maybe I came from a future
where it never happened,

475
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:50,789
and now you've come
from a future where it did.

476
00:37:53,084 --> 00:37:54,638
Is that possible?

477
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:01,484
Ever since I've been back here,
I've done...

478
00:38:03,208 --> 00:38:06,116
things.
I've changed things.

479
00:38:10,418 --> 00:38:12,310
Maybe I changed the future.

480
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:17,584
That's why we're here, isn't it?
To change the future.

481
00:38:21,776 --> 00:38:25,149
Do you think there's a version of it
where we're not together?

482
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,345
FBI, Department
of Homeland Security.

483
00:39:05,716 --> 00:39:07,263
Need you to come with us please.

484
00:39:10,524 --> 00:39:14,274
Two nights ago, you entered
the building unauthorized at 4:16 AM.

485
00:39:15,026 --> 00:39:16,715
What were you doing here?

486
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,190
That's a mistake.

487
00:39:19,009 --> 00:39:20,521
Two nights ago? No.

488
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:22,723
I wasn't there.

489
00:39:22,848 --> 00:39:25,540
I would have no reason
to be there at that time.

490
00:39:25,785 --> 00:39:27,784
Computers don't lie, Mr. Fischer.

491
00:39:32,233 --> 00:39:35,277
At 4:23, seven minutes
after you entered the building,

492
00:39:35,402 --> 00:39:38,926
there was an unauthorized access
to the computer networking system.

493
00:39:39,739 --> 00:39:41,028
That wasn't me.

494
00:39:41,668 --> 00:39:43,406
This system allows user access

495
00:39:43,531 --> 00:39:46,577
to all primary military-industrial
complex computer systems.

496
00:39:46,702 --> 00:39:47,984
I'm telling you

497
00:39:48,299 --> 00:39:50,197
that this is all a big mistake.

498
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,143
I do seismic retrofitting.

499
00:39:55,433 --> 00:39:58,982
I don't know how to access a computer.
Why would I do that?

500
00:39:59,207 --> 00:40:01,029
I don't know, Mr. Fischer.

501
00:40:01,354 --> 00:40:02,404
You tell me.

502
00:40:04,141 --> 00:40:07,365
Why would you install a roving back door
into those computer systems?

503
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:09,132
One that we can't dismantle so far.

504
00:40:09,257 --> 00:40:11,120
You want to tell us
how to do that as well?

505
00:40:12,168 --> 00:40:14,559
I don't know
what you're talking about.

506
00:40:14,958 --> 00:40:16,511
I wasn't there.

507
00:40:17,029 --> 00:40:20,079
What happened to you?
You look a little banged up.

508
00:40:20,405 --> 00:40:21,887
Wanna explain that?

509
00:40:29,589 --> 00:40:31,014
I don't know if I can.

510
00:40:31,841 --> 00:40:32,841
Try.

511
00:40:47,342 --> 00:40:48,342
So...

512
00:40:49,594 --> 00:40:51,744
what is it you wanted to show me?

513
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:11,433
We need to learn how they work...

514
00:41:14,021 --> 00:41:15,442
How to fight them.

515
00:41:25,293 --> 00:41:27,958
We can't allow history
to repeat itself,

516
00:41:28,092 --> 00:41:30,532
not when we have the power
to stop it.

517
00:41:31,597 --> 00:41:33,047
It's up to us now...

518
00:41:35,422 --> 00:41:36,496
The two of us.

519
00:41:39,972 --> 00:41:40,972
It is.

520
00:42:18,557 --> 00:42:19,747
What am I doing here?

521
00:42:20,438 --> 00:42:21,374
I don't know.

522
00:42:22,099 --> 00:42:24,169
It's a waste of time.
You just lie and lie.

523
00:42:24,722 --> 00:42:26,350
It's a waste of time.

524
00:42:26,591 --> 00:42:29,215
- I just lie and lie.
- Don't you have things to do?

525
00:42:29,677 --> 00:42:31,593
Yes, I do.
I have things to do.

526
00:42:35,475 --> 00:42:37,225
I should get back to work.
