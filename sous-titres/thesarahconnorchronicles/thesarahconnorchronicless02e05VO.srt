00:00:02,059 --> 00:00:04,569
http://Projet-SG.net

3
00:00:14,317 --> 00:00:15,518
Martin Bedell?

4
00:00:19,654 --> 00:00:20,939
His name was Martin Bedell.

5
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:26,219
He was in Century Work Camp
with you.

6
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:28,364
Right up until the escape.

7
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:29,616
So I knew him.

8
00:00:29,776 --> 00:00:32,077
You knew him.
Everybody knew him.

9
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:34,905
But he doesn't know this one, does he?
Not this Martin Bedell.

10
00:00:35,025 --> 00:00:37,082
No,
Another Martin Bedell.

11
00:00:37,242 --> 00:00:38,627
Maybe it's just coincidence.

12
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:41,420
How many coincidences
named Sarah Connor got killed,

13
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,254
before Skynet
finally locked in on you?

14
00:00:46,252 --> 00:00:47,674
Why would they want to kill him?

15
00:00:47,794 --> 00:00:50,387
He had experience
and knowledge John needed.

16
00:00:51,064 --> 00:00:53,014
Military prep school,
then West Point.

17
00:00:53,174 --> 00:00:54,683
Bedell had real training.

18
00:00:55,098 --> 00:00:57,695
He helped John
put the Resistance together.

19
00:01:10,906 --> 00:01:13,742
There were three Martin Bedells in LA.
Now there are two.

20
00:01:13,903 --> 00:01:15,542
How do we know which is the target?

21
00:01:15,662 --> 00:01:16,865
They both are.

22
00:01:18,015 --> 00:01:19,644
Machines are thorough.

23
00:01:20,624 --> 00:01:22,001
Only good thing about them.

24
00:01:23,094 --> 00:01:25,888
So it took you, what,
30 seconds to find those names?

25
00:01:26,008 --> 00:01:28,550
If there is a triple-eight out there,
he's found them too.

26
00:01:29,676 --> 00:01:32,703
- Where are you going?
- Martin Bedell number one.

27
00:01:32,823 --> 00:01:34,128
Closest address.

28
00:01:34,507 --> 00:01:37,684
- Without a plan?
- I've got a plan. It involves guns.

29
00:01:37,844 --> 00:01:38,560
Wait.

30
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:42,173
- You're not going with him.
- No. Everybody wait.

31
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:49,806
We thought it was a person.
It's not, it's a place.

32
00:01:49,926 --> 00:01:52,490
It's a military prep school
in Carlsbad.

33
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,367
Here's the student directory.

34
00:01:54,578 --> 00:01:56,379
Martin Bedell number two.

35
00:01:56,821 --> 00:01:58,371
Maybe we got a head start.

36
00:01:58,776 --> 00:02:00,284
I'll load the truck.

37
00:02:00,628 --> 00:02:03,042
- We'll go.
- We will, will we?

38
00:02:04,851 --> 00:02:06,003
It's a boys school.

39
00:02:06,496 --> 00:02:07,756
I can do this.

40
00:02:08,157 --> 00:02:09,346
I am doing this.

41
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,469
Nothing complicated. Find the kid,

42
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,012
throw him in a hole, babysit.

43
00:02:15,865 --> 00:02:17,389
It's as safe as anything we do.

44
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,783
Go.

45
00:02:25,338 --> 00:02:26,201
Two.

46
00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:30,904
Two Sarah Connors were murdered
before they found me.

47
00:02:32,893 --> 00:02:35,688
Cameron and I
will find the other Martin Bedell.

48
00:02:35,808 --> 00:02:39,107
Maybe we can stop the triple-eight
before he gets to you.

49
00:02:41,816 --> 00:02:43,290
He's not a soldier.

50
00:02:45,367 --> 00:02:46,218
No.

51
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:47,891
Not yet.

52
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,759
You haven't said a word
since Anaheim.

53
00:03:37,873 --> 00:03:39,681
That's 40 miles of quiet.

54
00:03:44,643 --> 00:03:47,265
You thinking or worrying?

55
00:03:49,092 --> 00:03:49,983
Thinking.

56
00:03:51,853 --> 00:03:53,061
About Bedell.

57
00:03:53,312 --> 00:03:55,238
Where are we supposed to hide him?

58
00:03:55,695 --> 00:03:57,998
Who said we were going to hide him?

59
00:03:58,561 --> 00:04:00,259
Martin Bedell
hiding in a cave somewhere

60
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:03,176
might as well be
Martin Bedell dead somewhere.

61
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,681
No use to John Connor.

62
00:04:07,577 --> 00:04:09,719
Besides, it's a military school.

63
00:04:09,839 --> 00:04:11,684
Soldiers, guns,

64
00:04:12,557 --> 00:04:14,572
can't do much better than that.

65
00:04:17,913 --> 00:04:21,435
So you own this nuclear plant,
Serrano Point?

66
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:24,507
I have an interest in it.

67
00:04:24,802 --> 00:04:27,503
Is this the same company
you were referring to the other day?

68
00:04:27,623 --> 00:04:29,452
The one you wanted me to look into?

69
00:04:29,572 --> 00:04:30,435
It is.

70
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,869
The near-meltdown
a few weeks back...

71
00:04:34,239 --> 00:04:37,142
The news said
an employee caused the accident.

72
00:04:39,582 --> 00:04:42,702
Mr. Ellison,
there are no accidents.

73
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:43,353
Kansas, this is Hammerhead.
Do you copy?

74
00:05:43,473 --> 00:05:45,257
- Kansas, respond!
- He's back. It's Kyle.

75
00:05:55,508 --> 00:05:58,194
- Tin cans just hit Kansas bunker.
- Survivors?

76
00:05:59,355 --> 00:06:00,359
Prisoners now.

77
00:06:01,185 --> 00:06:03,572
One ogre tank, three monkey wagons.

78
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:06,744
The convoy will roll out down Wilshire
to century in the next hour.

79
00:06:06,904 --> 00:06:09,497
- And I'm thinking...
- No. We've got our orders.

80
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:11,668
Connor
wants this corridor controlled.

81
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,710
So we sit tight,
we observe Skynet movement,

82
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:18,214
- and we'll report back and that's it.
- What's that report going to say?

83
00:06:19,447 --> 00:06:22,677
That we observed Skynet move these
people into a Death Camp while we sat?

84
00:06:22,837 --> 00:06:24,355
I know it sucks, all right?

85
00:06:24,475 --> 00:06:27,223
But if we lose eyes on this road,
we could lose a lot more, Kyle.

86
00:06:29,774 --> 00:06:31,832
- If Connor were here...
- Connor isn't here.

87
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:35,549
Corporal, get below.

88
00:06:35,893 --> 00:06:37,692
Round up every tunnel rat
you can find.

89
00:06:45,109 --> 00:06:46,533
You know what he'd say.

90
00:06:46,694 --> 00:06:48,953
- You know what Connor would say.
- Yes.

91
00:06:49,171 --> 00:06:51,016
If he wants to shoot me
for disobeying orders,

92
00:06:51,136 --> 00:06:53,249
he can get in line
behind the tin cans.

93
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,022
We're doing this.

94
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,419
You all right?

95
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:20,817
We see a lot of boys like your nephew,
Lieutenant.

96
00:07:20,937 --> 00:07:24,322
Single mother. Socially withdrawn.
Move around a lot.

97
00:07:24,761 --> 00:07:26,657
Tend to cling
to male authority figures.

98
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:30,824
- Lost his dad, you said, in the war?
- Killed. On a mission.

99
00:07:31,906 --> 00:07:34,457
- Can't tell you any more than that.
- Don't know?

100
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,126
- Can't.
- I understand.

101
00:07:40,122 --> 00:07:42,365
Good grades.
Good test scores.

102
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,190
Good kid.
Here's what I'll do.

103
00:07:46,926 --> 00:07:49,877
Three weeks as a plebe.
If he likes it, he can stay.

104
00:07:49,997 --> 00:07:51,432
Then we'll talk tuition.

105
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:52,860
Thank you.

106
00:07:54,102 --> 00:07:55,685
I'll give him the news.

107
00:07:56,507 --> 00:07:57,522
Lieutenant.

108
00:07:59,195 --> 00:08:01,150
I lost one of my TACs
a couple weeks ago.

109
00:08:01,637 --> 00:08:04,821
Reservist. Had to go.
TAC. Teacher-advisor.

110
00:08:05,093 --> 00:08:08,697
They keep the cadets
from going all lord of the flies on us.

111
00:08:08,973 --> 00:08:11,713
Hired a replacement,
but he's not due for a week.

112
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,246
- I'm shorthanded.
- Sir...

113
00:08:14,154 --> 00:08:17,291
Respectfully, I'm probably the last guy
you're looking for.

114
00:08:20,758 --> 00:08:23,881
Guys like you get dropped
into the ass end of nowhere.

115
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:27,006
You can handle 30 adolescents
for a week.

116
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,735
Good news.
You're in.

117
00:08:34,651 --> 00:08:37,056
- And what's the bad news?
- I'm in.

118
00:08:45,103 --> 00:08:47,874
Man up, nube!
You don't want to get owned.

119
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:51,576
Stop crying about your internet
connection, and learn to play.

120
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,372
I got to EFK, man.

121
00:09:08,627 --> 00:09:09,474
Yes?

122
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,187
Come on, let's go.

123
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,826
Hurry up! Let's go.

124
00:09:37,198 --> 00:09:38,050
Drive.

125
00:09:54,698 --> 00:09:56,014
You good? You okay?

126
00:09:56,175 --> 00:09:58,517
- Seatbelt.
- Who is that man? He should be dead.

127
00:09:58,677 --> 00:10:01,062
How come he's not dead
and where's my mom?

128
00:10:01,223 --> 00:10:02,437
No more questions.

129
00:10:02,598 --> 00:10:04,190
Her current location is unknown.

130
00:10:04,511 --> 00:10:06,901
That man is a cyborg
sent to kill you.

131
00:10:10,314 --> 00:10:11,928
Get your seatbelt on.

132
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:17,633
I'm familiar with the incident reports,
Mr. Nelson. I know what they say.

133
00:10:17,753 --> 00:10:20,455
But what I don't know is
what really happened.

134
00:10:20,859 --> 00:10:23,655
The people who wrote those reports
are bureaucrats.

135
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:27,630
You know what bureaucrats do when
the facts don't fit their checkboxes?

136
00:10:28,007 --> 00:10:30,209
They ignore them. Or change them.

137
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,051
So this valve supposedly blew open
because of metal fatigue.

138
00:10:36,171 --> 00:10:37,313
Sure. Okay.

139
00:10:37,651 --> 00:10:40,356
Not likely,
but let's grant mother nature that one.

140
00:10:40,476 --> 00:10:43,379
So how in the hell
did it force itself closed?

141
00:10:45,621 --> 00:10:48,192
How strong do you have to be
to force it open and push it back?

142
00:10:49,219 --> 00:10:51,638
On a scale of one to ten?
Superman.

143
00:10:58,761 --> 00:11:02,463
Report says this damage
was caused by a transformer explosion.

144
00:11:03,045 --> 00:11:05,462
You want to see
what the security tapes say?

145
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,767
There are no tapes.
They're gone.

146
00:11:07,887 --> 00:11:10,089
That they are.
And who took those?

147
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,466
Carl Greenway,
on the way to hanging himself?

148
00:11:13,223 --> 00:11:16,320
Those mystery employees
who shut the reactor down?

149
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,556
You ask the same questions I would.

150
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,952
Putting together a report
for the NRC.

151
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:26,856
They're going to crawl up
this place's ass with a wire brush.

152
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:29,842
It's going to play hell
with the schedule.

153
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:32,451
Schedule? What schedule is that?

154
00:11:32,571 --> 00:11:35,470
August 2009.
New automated system comes online.

155
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,158
We're back in business.

156
00:11:37,686 --> 00:11:39,325
That's what they say.

157
00:11:39,544 --> 00:11:42,538
Of course, that ain't going to happen
if the feds are on a war path.

158
00:12:42,758 --> 00:12:44,360
- You jammed?
- Yeah.

159
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:46,060
You know sports?

160
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:48,749
Like wrestling?

161
00:12:49,162 --> 00:12:50,572
No, it's a mnemonic.

162
00:12:50,692 --> 00:12:52,942
Sports. S-P-O-R-T-S. May I?

163
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:57,489
All right.
So you want to slap.

164
00:12:57,609 --> 00:12:58,611
Pull.

165
00:12:58,805 --> 00:12:59,813
Observe.

166
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:01,846
Release.

167
00:13:02,212 --> 00:13:03,219
Tap.

168
00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:05,037
Shoot.

169
00:13:15,933 --> 00:13:17,425
All right. Thanks, plebe.

170
00:13:17,758 --> 00:13:19,459
You're welcome, I think.

171
00:13:26,952 --> 00:13:28,519
I'm Cadet Captain Martin Bedell.

172
00:13:29,151 --> 00:13:31,233
Commandant asked me
to keep an eye on you.

173
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:32,481
Prep you for OCC.

174
00:13:34,704 --> 00:13:35,807
What's this?

175
00:13:36,118 --> 00:13:37,987
It's a merit...
for squaring away Pyle.

176
00:13:41,644 --> 00:13:44,577
And that's a demerit.
Next time you have a problem,

177
00:13:45,049 --> 00:13:47,079
flag down a senior cadet
or an instructor.

178
00:13:48,131 --> 00:13:49,326
You run, Baum?

179
00:13:50,323 --> 00:13:51,525
I love to run.

180
00:13:54,854 --> 00:13:57,546
- You look ate up.
- Oh, no. This is great.

181
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:01,194
Yeah. Imagine how it's going to be
with a marine DI screaming at you.

182
00:14:01,314 --> 00:14:02,760
Like everything's life and death.

183
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:05,561
I can imagine.

184
00:14:12,841 --> 00:14:14,252
That the new TAC?

185
00:14:15,463 --> 00:14:18,486
Good ambush point.
In case you're looking for one.

186
00:14:19,371 --> 00:14:20,979
Or in case you choose

187
00:14:21,373 --> 00:14:24,492
to jog in the woods. By yourself.

188
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:28,119
You should be careful.

189
00:14:28,694 --> 00:14:29,933
Of that, too.

190
00:14:30,681 --> 00:14:32,195
It's tar.
La Brea.

191
00:14:32,493 --> 00:14:34,585
- It's everywhere.
- That smells terrible.

192
00:14:36,205 --> 00:14:37,922
- It smells like...
- Jet fuel.

193
00:14:38,292 --> 00:14:39,136
So...

194
00:14:41,142 --> 00:14:43,550
You're out here jogging,
in the open,

195
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,068
exposed, with...

196
00:15:08,502 --> 00:15:11,247
- I've heard a lot about you.
- A lot of good, I hope, Sir.

197
00:15:13,257 --> 00:15:14,416
Lot of good.

198
00:15:25,427 --> 00:15:28,514
- So when do I get to call my mom?
- When it's safe.

199
00:15:28,674 --> 00:15:30,375
- When's that?
- Soon.

200
00:15:39,501 --> 00:15:40,774
Do you do this every night?

201
00:15:41,424 --> 00:15:42,230
Yeah.

202
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,697
Well, what happens
when you go to sleep?

203
00:15:45,329 --> 00:15:46,436
She happens.

204
00:15:57,392 --> 00:15:59,894
Let's find you
something to wear for bed.

205
00:16:04,151 --> 00:16:06,353
Something in here should fit you.

206
00:16:09,222 --> 00:16:10,222
Try these.

207
00:16:11,556 --> 00:16:12,641
This is too small.

208
00:16:13,167 --> 00:16:16,437
- How do you know? Just try them.
- They're for a five year old.

209
00:16:18,798 --> 00:16:20,149
How 'bout this?

210
00:16:20,844 --> 00:16:22,652
That's for playing soccer.

211
00:16:26,815 --> 00:16:29,086
This isn't your stuff. Is it?

212
00:16:30,766 --> 00:16:32,474
No. It's not our stuff.

213
00:16:33,489 --> 00:16:35,080
I want to call my mom.

214
00:16:35,356 --> 00:16:38,656
She was supposed to get me a book.
For my book report.

215
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:44,256
If you call your mother,
that man will use her to find you.

216
00:16:44,621 --> 00:16:47,009
Then he'll kill her.
He'll kill you.

217
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:56,092
Would you like a bedtime story?

218
00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:07,348
We made a tactical error.

219
00:17:07,598 --> 00:17:09,783
We should have engaged
the triple-eight.

220
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:12,242
With a little boy in the crossfire?

221
00:17:12,534 --> 00:17:14,203
The boy is not important.

222
00:17:14,363 --> 00:17:16,664
- Is not our mission.
- He is now.

223
00:17:25,124 --> 00:17:26,798
It's just a meet and greet, Sir.
Say hi.

224
00:17:26,918 --> 00:17:29,735
Ask them how they're holding up.
Then company dismissed.

225
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,856
It's easy.

226
00:17:30,976 --> 00:17:34,665
They're probably going to want
to ask you about OCC prep weekend

227
00:17:34,785 --> 00:17:36,771
we take the juniors
through field exercises.

228
00:17:36,891 --> 00:17:38,944
Obstacle courses,
simulated missions.

229
00:17:39,064 --> 00:17:42,267
Running around in the woods,
you know? It'll be fun.

230
00:17:42,946 --> 00:17:43,772
Fun.

231
00:17:46,744 --> 00:17:47,554
Hi,

232
00:17:49,106 --> 00:17:50,945
I'm Lieutenant Baum.

233
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,202
I'm your new TAC.

234
00:17:54,915 --> 00:17:56,692
So I've been told

235
00:17:57,399 --> 00:18:00,040
that my job is to make sure
that you're all doing okay.

236
00:18:04,663 --> 00:18:06,665
Well, you all look okay to me.

237
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:08,529
So...

238
00:18:10,099 --> 00:18:11,301
Any questions?

239
00:18:14,563 --> 00:18:15,865
All right, then.

240
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:17,182
Sir.

241
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:20,227
We heard you were in the war.

242
00:18:21,145 --> 00:18:22,645
Heard you seen action.

243
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:25,353
Yeah.

244
00:18:29,063 --> 00:18:30,903
Yeah, I've seen action in the war.

245
00:18:31,064 --> 00:18:32,567
Got a lot of kills?

246
00:18:34,337 --> 00:18:36,535
- Say again?
- Kills, sir.

247
00:18:38,071 --> 00:18:39,913
I want to go infantry
as soon as possible.

248
00:18:40,033 --> 00:18:42,583
Maybe Rangers. Maybe Delta.
Best of the best.

249
00:18:44,054 --> 00:18:45,467
Best of the best.

250
00:18:46,991 --> 00:18:48,005
Counting kills.

251
00:18:48,787 --> 00:18:50,188
Like it's a game.

252
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,425
Like it's just a game.

253
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:56,739
I remember
one particularly fun day.

254
00:18:59,535 --> 00:19:00,937
A guy in my squad

255
00:19:01,678 --> 00:19:04,146
got his stomach blasted open
in a fire fight.

256
00:19:05,974 --> 00:19:09,139
He spent six hours
holding his own guts in.

257
00:19:10,437 --> 00:19:11,441
His buddy

258
00:19:12,405 --> 00:19:14,116
carried him on his back

259
00:19:14,398 --> 00:19:16,303
to the nearest aid station,

260
00:19:16,975 --> 00:19:20,704
just praying that someone could put
the dumb son of a bitch together again.

261
00:19:24,395 --> 00:19:25,934
The game, Pyle,

262
00:19:28,258 --> 00:19:30,964
the game is played
with your buddy's life.

263
00:19:31,227 --> 00:19:34,259
With the life of your squad.
Your platoon.

264
00:19:35,844 --> 00:19:37,646
The game is played by you.

265
00:19:38,591 --> 00:19:41,075
On behalf
of the whole damn human race.

266
00:20:05,284 --> 00:20:06,484
Meet my friend, the EFP.

267
00:20:07,565 --> 00:20:09,752
He sits in the middle of the road
and blows up metal.

268
00:20:09,914 --> 00:20:11,464
This is his life's ambition.

269
00:20:11,584 --> 00:20:13,277
I intend to help him achieve it.

270
00:20:13,397 --> 00:20:15,143
We've seeded the street
with these things.

271
00:20:15,263 --> 00:20:17,154
We got to make sure
that ogre cooperates.

272
00:20:17,274 --> 00:20:20,278
Corporal Reese will take you and set up
over at LACMA and the page.

273
00:20:20,398 --> 00:20:23,807
When the convoy rolls to your position,
open fire on this bunker.

274
00:20:24,426 --> 00:20:26,402
He'll think it's metal on skin
and move to assist.

275
00:20:26,522 --> 00:20:28,526
And when it does, boom.

276
00:20:29,392 --> 00:20:30,337
Questions?

277
00:20:32,086 --> 00:20:33,086
Move out.

278
00:20:35,955 --> 00:20:38,102
They're kids.
They key off of you.

279
00:20:39,521 --> 00:20:40,401
I know.

280
00:20:43,318 --> 00:20:44,415
They're kids.

281
00:21:06,844 --> 00:21:07,940
Your uncle...

282
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:09,646
He's an intense guy.

283
00:21:10,689 --> 00:21:12,990
Yeah, I know.
He's a good guy, though.

284
00:21:14,895 --> 00:21:17,321
He's just...
He's a lot to take sometimes.

285
00:21:18,647 --> 00:21:20,960
All that he's been through.
You know...

286
00:21:22,521 --> 00:21:25,787
- What are you supposed to say to that?
- You mean, how do you measure up?

287
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:31,170
Every man in my family,
going back five generations,

288
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,962
has been a General or statesman,
CEO, something amazing,

289
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:36,715
they all went here.

290
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,260
But you know what the best part
about Presidio Alto is?

291
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,096
The cross-country course.

292
00:21:44,771 --> 00:21:47,346
You know,
sometimes when I'm out there...

293
00:21:47,466 --> 00:21:50,029
when I'm all alone,
and I'm going flat-out...

294
00:21:50,586 --> 00:21:52,303
everything just, sort of,

295
00:21:53,447 --> 00:21:54,441
falls away.

296
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,073
But sometimes, I wish that...

297
00:22:00,656 --> 00:22:03,776
Wish you could just keep on running
and never look back.

298
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:12,518
I met this girl over the summer.

299
00:22:13,288 --> 00:22:14,693
Her name's Alicia.

300
00:22:15,336 --> 00:22:16,588
She's amazing, dude.

301
00:22:17,681 --> 00:22:20,467
She started at Dartmouth this year.
She's a runner like me.

302
00:22:20,733 --> 00:22:23,869
She's coming home in a couple of weeks.
When she goes back,

303
00:22:25,122 --> 00:22:27,067
I think I wanna go with her...

304
00:22:27,802 --> 00:22:28,934
and never look back.

305
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,024
That's a secret, Baum.

306
00:22:37,048 --> 00:22:38,151
You treat it as such.

307
00:22:43,805 --> 00:22:45,085
I always do.

308
00:23:10,426 --> 00:23:11,643
I was just on the roof.

309
00:23:13,513 --> 00:23:16,940
There's flat terrain all around,
but the woods are a problem.

310
00:23:18,061 --> 00:23:20,439
When it comes out,
that's where it'll come from.

311
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,613
You're alone and exposed here.
It's not good.

312
00:23:26,023 --> 00:23:28,076
And you're gonna tell me
I know better.

313
00:23:30,712 --> 00:23:32,069
Bedell is quitting.

314
00:23:32,832 --> 00:23:34,052
Leaving school.

315
00:23:35,555 --> 00:23:36,711
No, he isn't.

316
00:23:37,068 --> 00:23:38,024
He won't.

317
00:23:38,213 --> 00:23:40,380
- Well, he is.
- He doesn't.

318
00:23:40,709 --> 00:23:41,960
He graduates.

319
00:23:42,492 --> 00:23:43,717
Goes to West Point.

320
00:23:44,585 --> 00:23:45,340
Why?

321
00:23:47,648 --> 00:23:49,765
Because the future already happened

322
00:23:50,398 --> 00:23:52,464
and he's just going
through the motions?

323
00:23:52,584 --> 00:23:55,326
- He doesn't have a choice?
- He's got a choice.

324
00:23:56,856 --> 00:23:58,548
We've gotta help him
make the right one.

325
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:01,103
Like everybody does with me.

326
00:24:05,668 --> 00:24:07,529
There are three exits
within 20 meters,

327
00:24:07,649 --> 00:24:10,147
two of them lead to a parking lot,
and there's a black hatchback

328
00:24:10,267 --> 00:24:13,246
three cars in with the doors unlocked
and the keys above the visor.

329
00:24:18,239 --> 00:24:19,503
I do know better.

330
00:24:22,582 --> 00:24:25,515
<i>We're begging you.
Be merciful and keep our son safe.</i>

331
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,768
<i>Marty, if you can hear this,</i>

332
00:24:29,976 --> 00:24:31,514
<i>we're gonna get you back.</i>

333
00:24:31,676 --> 00:24:33,558
- <i>Your dad and I love...</i>
- Turn that off.

334
00:24:37,569 --> 00:24:39,502
What were you thinking,
letting him watch that?

335
00:24:39,622 --> 00:24:41,417
He wanted to see his mother.

336
00:24:47,275 --> 00:24:48,402
You all right?

337
00:24:49,344 --> 00:24:50,699
I told you people.

338
00:24:50,861 --> 00:24:53,086
And I told you
I had to get it done by Monday.

339
00:24:53,206 --> 00:24:54,462
And it's Friday already.

340
00:24:54,582 --> 00:24:57,083
And I haven't even started,
and I'm already in trouble,

341
00:24:57,203 --> 00:24:59,345
and when you don't do it,
the teacher makes you stand up

342
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:01,276
in front of the whole class!

343
00:25:01,663 --> 00:25:03,331
Marty, slow down.

344
00:25:04,028 --> 00:25:05,619
You're hyperventilating.

345
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,819
There.

346
00:25:08,388 --> 00:25:09,513
Take a breath.

347
00:25:11,577 --> 00:25:13,265
Tell me what this is about.

348
00:25:15,452 --> 00:25:16,485
I told you.

349
00:25:17,308 --> 00:25:18,562
My book report.

350
00:25:18,993 --> 00:25:20,028
Book report?

351
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:22,399
Yeah.
It's due by Monday.

352
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,519
And I haven't even
picked out a book, yet.

353
00:25:24,639 --> 00:25:25,919
Don't you listen?

354
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,325
Let's find you one.

355
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:38,231
There's gotta be something
for you somewhere.

356
00:25:49,288 --> 00:25:50,969


357
00:25:53,482 --> 00:25:55,181
It was John's favorite.

358
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,764
Who's John?

359
00:26:04,277 --> 00:26:05,806
The machine won't stop.

360
00:26:06,139 --> 00:26:08,215
He'll go back to that kid's house,

361
00:26:08,335 --> 00:26:10,780
- find his parents, find his mom.
- I would.

362
00:26:11,014 --> 00:26:12,514
The police'll be there by now.

363
00:26:12,722 --> 00:26:14,825
- Police won't matter.
- I know.

364
00:26:15,637 --> 00:26:18,455
You don't need to be here.
There are other places to be.

365
00:26:18,735 --> 00:26:20,664
You want me to protect his parents?

366
00:26:20,826 --> 00:26:22,709
I want you to keep this contained.

367
00:26:33,981 --> 00:26:35,538
Something you need, officer?

368
00:26:36,577 --> 00:26:37,577
Good eye.

369
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:39,726
- Job requirement.
- Right.

370
00:26:40,639 --> 00:26:41,857
Private sector.

371
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:44,397
Looking into the plant accident.

372
00:26:45,348 --> 00:26:47,066
When Carl Greenway went nuts?

373
00:26:47,228 --> 00:26:49,581
Yeah.
When Carl Greenway went nuts.

374
00:26:50,928 --> 00:26:53,633
- I understand he used to come in here.
- They all do.

375
00:26:53,753 --> 00:26:55,036
Including Carl.

376
00:26:56,367 --> 00:26:57,769
Sit right where you're sitting.

377
00:26:58,452 --> 00:26:59,331
Drink alone.

378
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:00,622
Drink a lot?

379
00:27:00,951 --> 00:27:02,092
Tonic water.

380
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:04,251
Like you, I bet.

381
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:06,829
Was he alone like me?

382
00:27:07,107 --> 00:27:08,767
Pretty much every night.

383
00:27:08,887 --> 00:27:11,392
I don't know why the guy
came in here at all.

384
00:27:11,651 --> 00:27:14,114
Still, I do remember some hottie
chatting him up at the bar

385
00:27:14,234 --> 00:27:17,329
the night before everything went down
at the power plant.

386
00:27:17,766 --> 00:27:19,712
Probably one of Sandy's friends.

387
00:27:21,011 --> 00:27:23,144
Sandra runs HR at the plant.

388
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:25,475
Her birthday party that night,

389
00:27:26,308 --> 00:27:27,466
I got pictures.

390
00:27:29,811 --> 00:27:30,629
May I?

391
00:27:58,762 --> 00:28:00,181
Find who you're looking for?

392
00:28:02,379 --> 00:28:04,232
Actually, quite the opposite.

393
00:28:17,633 --> 00:28:19,162
These gonna kill it?

394
00:28:19,538 --> 00:28:21,360
No, a speed bump.
That's all.

395
00:28:23,232 --> 00:28:24,327
This...

396
00:28:26,389 --> 00:28:27,389
Raufoss.

397
00:28:28,031 --> 00:28:29,203
Mark 211 round.

398
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:31,893
Tungsten core,
armor piercing.

399
00:28:32,013 --> 00:28:33,690
High explosive incendiary.

400
00:28:34,983 --> 00:28:37,267
Hits with the force
of a 20 millimeter cannon.

401
00:28:37,387 --> 00:28:39,737
Saw your dad take down an HK
with one of those.

402
00:28:39,857 --> 00:28:42,189
He liked it better
than his plasma rifle.

403
00:28:43,694 --> 00:28:44,933
So this is gonna kill it.

404
00:28:45,777 --> 00:28:47,120
Make it stop.

405
00:28:47,841 --> 00:28:49,756
Reconsider its life choices.

406
00:29:08,859 --> 00:29:10,077
That soldier...

407
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:14,620
The one you talked about
in your story.

408
00:29:15,615 --> 00:29:18,410
My dad carried him
to that aid station, didn't he?

409
00:29:19,447 --> 00:29:20,189
Yeah.

410
00:29:21,935 --> 00:29:25,859
He spent a whole night in the bunker,
gettint the blood out of his fatigues.

411
00:29:26,233 --> 00:29:27,747
You know what's funny?

412
00:29:28,595 --> 00:29:30,337
I saw a deer the other day.

413
00:29:30,457 --> 00:29:32,155
Made me think of him.

414
00:29:35,233 --> 00:29:37,141
We were together
the last time I saw one.

415
00:29:37,261 --> 00:29:39,268
- Before Judgment Day?
- No. After.

416
00:29:39,388 --> 00:29:42,077
We were up in Griffith Park,
hunting for food.

417
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:44,873
It was a big bastard too.

418
00:29:47,763 --> 00:29:50,892
Your dad had never seen one before.
I mean, not like that.

419
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:55,345
After I killed it
and we got close...

420
00:29:58,918 --> 00:30:00,677
your dad started crying.

421
00:30:01,802 --> 00:30:05,215
You know, more than I'd ever heard
or seen him.

422
00:30:09,001 --> 00:30:11,133
I didn't know how to make him stop.

423
00:30:12,152 --> 00:30:13,526
I buried the deer.

424
00:30:14,824 --> 00:30:16,011
We went hungry.

425
00:30:21,245 --> 00:30:22,666
He was just a boy.

426
00:30:24,367 --> 00:30:25,448
So were you.

427
00:30:26,072 --> 00:30:26,798
Yep.

428
00:30:28,369 --> 00:30:29,604
I guess I was.

429
00:30:38,261 --> 00:30:40,253
You see how the metal is twisted?

430
00:30:41,137 --> 00:30:44,815
You can have the steelers' entire
offensive line tuggin' on that valve

431
00:30:44,935 --> 00:30:47,251
and not generate enough force
to do that.

432
00:30:47,884 --> 00:30:49,684
So you agree it was a machine,
as I thought.

433
00:30:50,664 --> 00:30:51,811
Two machines.

434
00:30:52,636 --> 00:30:54,375
One machine ripped the valve open,

435
00:30:54,495 --> 00:30:56,889
and I'm guessing
the other closed it.

436
00:30:57,907 --> 00:31:00,236
And I'm pretty sure
there was a fight between them.

437
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:03,153
Two machines.

438
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:05,885
This is new.

439
00:31:08,636 --> 00:31:11,448
Where did they come from?
Why did they fight?

440
00:31:13,907 --> 00:31:15,251
I wish I knew.

441
00:31:15,979 --> 00:31:17,847
I wish any of this made sense.

442
00:31:19,358 --> 00:31:22,122
I do know I'm not
the only one asking questions.

443
00:31:22,583 --> 00:31:23,885
The plant manager, Nelson.

444
00:31:24,389 --> 00:31:26,340
He wants the NRC to investigate.

445
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,706
It'll be a nightmare.

446
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:32,685
That will complicate
our respective goals, won't it, James?

447
00:31:34,012 --> 00:31:36,350
What would
those respective goals be?

448
00:31:38,074 --> 00:31:41,281
I'd like my company to lead the world
into the next century.

449
00:31:42,475 --> 00:31:44,067
And I'm fairly sure

450
00:31:44,867 --> 00:31:46,630
you're an avenging angel.

451
00:31:48,044 --> 00:31:49,588
So let's keep looking.

452
00:31:52,527 --> 00:31:54,457
Before the nightmare begins.

453
00:31:58,935 --> 00:31:59,954
Last one.

454
00:32:00,074 --> 00:32:01,586
Hey, it's for my heart.

455
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,574
You never heard
of the french paradox?

456
00:32:05,694 --> 00:32:08,406
Those frogs eat foie gras
and gargle red wine,

457
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:10,209
they live till they're 90.

458
00:32:10,885 --> 00:32:14,029
Yeah, but it's the chemicals
in the grape skins that do it.

459
00:32:16,871 --> 00:32:17,736
Well...

460
00:32:19,057 --> 00:32:20,045
<i>Bonjour.</i>

461
00:32:21,134 --> 00:32:23,342
Resvera... something.

462
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:27,626
I saw it on 60 minutes.

463
00:32:28,918 --> 00:32:30,046
You don't say.

464
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:34,545
You're so beautiful.

465
00:32:38,807 --> 00:32:40,058
Sorry, Alicia.

466
00:32:41,754 --> 00:32:43,623
That's never happened to me before.

467
00:32:44,803 --> 00:32:46,342
Don't worry, sweetie.

468
00:32:56,136 --> 00:32:58,829
I bet that never
happened before, either.

469
00:33:12,602 --> 00:33:14,609
The FBI has moved Marty's parents.

470
00:33:14,729 --> 00:33:17,790
- And the triple-eight?
- He's made no attempt to acquire them.

471
00:33:18,094 --> 00:33:21,224
So what would you do now?
In your professional robot opinion.

472
00:33:21,455 --> 00:33:23,225
Marty's trail has gone cold.

473
00:33:23,345 --> 00:33:25,413
I'd switch targets
to the other Martin Bedell.

474
00:33:25,533 --> 00:33:27,254
So go to the other
Martin Bedell's house.

475
00:33:27,374 --> 00:33:30,698
Wait for the triple-eight.
When it shows up, blow it's head off.

476
00:33:30,818 --> 00:33:32,055
He can put it back on.

477
00:33:34,361 --> 00:33:36,261
Marty likes the crust cut off.

478
00:33:43,406 --> 00:33:44,472
Here you go.

479
00:33:46,956 --> 00:33:50,156
My teacher doesn't like us to pick books
that have been made into movies.

480
00:33:50,405 --> 00:33:52,551
She thinks we'll just cheat
and watch the movie instead.

481
00:33:52,671 --> 00:33:54,785
You'd be in big trouble if you did.

482
00:33:54,905 --> 00:33:57,286
The movie is pretty different
than the book.

483
00:33:57,406 --> 00:33:58,164
Really?

484
00:33:59,451 --> 00:34:00,287
How?

485
00:34:00,407 --> 00:34:03,471
Well, the slippers aren't ruby.
They're silver.

486
00:34:04,447 --> 00:34:07,026
And there are two good witches,
not one.

487
00:34:08,248 --> 00:34:10,874
And Dorothy's not 16,
she's nearer your age.

488
00:34:11,077 --> 00:34:12,606
Smart and brave.

489
00:34:14,166 --> 00:34:15,633
If that guy finds me,

490
00:34:16,282 --> 00:34:18,096
he's really gonna kill me.

491
00:34:21,155 --> 00:34:22,589
He won't touch you.

492
00:34:24,281 --> 00:34:25,281
I promise.

493
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:37,036
Baum.

494
00:34:37,156 --> 00:34:38,529
How you holding up?

495
00:34:39,445 --> 00:34:42,370
Shouldn't you be digging
a tunnel outta here or something?

496
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:46,342
I'm not gonna skip out on my buddies.
I owe them this much.

497
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:50,252
Not everybody
gets to run away, you know.

498
00:34:50,903 --> 00:34:52,414
Pick up the pace, Baum.

499
00:34:52,534 --> 00:34:54,851
I'm not gonna carry you
up this hill.

500
00:35:01,012 --> 00:35:04,564
888 has been to that kid's house.
Knows about the school, has his picture.

501
00:35:04,985 --> 00:35:05,927
How long?

502
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:09,068
<i>Cameron says two, maybe three hours.
She's on her way.</i>

503
00:35:09,717 --> 00:35:12,905
You told me you'd throw that kid
in a hole. Babysit. Nothing complicated.

504
00:35:16,132 --> 00:35:18,407
It won't touch him.
I won't let it.

505
00:35:18,595 --> 00:35:19,829
You better not.

506
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:21,785
'Cause if you do,

507
00:35:21,905 --> 00:35:24,083
pray that triple-eight gets
to you before I do.

508
00:35:42,398 --> 00:35:44,375
Is... Is everything okay?

509
00:35:44,906 --> 00:35:46,279
Everything's fine.

510
00:35:50,936 --> 00:35:52,728
Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't...

511
00:35:54,326 --> 00:35:55,685
I didn't mean this.

512
00:35:56,718 --> 00:35:58,743
This was never the plan, ever.

513
00:36:01,847 --> 00:36:03,122
What was the plan?

514
00:36:03,906 --> 00:36:06,128
I don't know. You can't always have one.
Not all the time.

515
00:36:06,248 --> 00:36:08,884
Sometimes you just do.
And I did. To you.

516
00:36:10,032 --> 00:36:10,849
Well...

517
00:36:11,311 --> 00:36:12,902
You saved my life, right?

518
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:14,544
So...

519
00:36:16,032 --> 00:36:17,192
good plan.

520
00:36:19,233 --> 00:36:20,281
Thank you.

521
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:25,828
I said thank you.

522
00:36:26,849 --> 00:36:28,175
I know.
I just...

523
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:32,066
I haven't heard that in...

524
00:36:34,773 --> 00:36:36,240
I haven't heard that.

525
00:36:36,921 --> 00:36:38,093
You're welcome?

526
00:36:39,235 --> 00:36:40,034
Say it.

527
00:36:45,046 --> 00:36:46,266
You're welcome.

528
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:49,982
Now say, "Marty...

529
00:36:51,134 --> 00:36:53,464
"Let me help you
with your book report."

530
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:04,818
I can't call my mom and...

531
00:37:06,087 --> 00:37:07,728
you're not doing anything.

532
00:37:08,218 --> 00:37:09,035
So...

533
00:37:22,464 --> 00:37:23,929
Thank you, Marty.

534
00:37:26,646 --> 00:37:27,882
You're welcome.

535
00:37:30,063 --> 00:37:32,889
Tonight's exercise
is a rescue extraction.

536
00:37:33,896 --> 00:37:35,214
Meet old fred.

537
00:37:35,615 --> 00:37:37,021
He weighs about 75 pounds,

538
00:37:37,141 --> 00:37:39,552
and needs to be carried
from place to place.

539
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:42,151
This is his life's ambition.

540
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:45,935
- And I intend to help him...
- Forget that! All eyes on me.

541
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,055
Seniors...

542
00:37:47,536 --> 00:37:50,259
Get your people online.
Ten meter spacing. Eyes up.

543
00:37:50,379 --> 00:37:53,111
- What about the obstacle course?
- New exercise.

544
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:57,608
A guy with a gun
is gonna come through here.

545
00:37:57,728 --> 00:37:59,693
Do not initiate contact.

546
00:38:00,681 --> 00:38:02,241
Not even for laughs.
Are we clear?

547
00:38:03,206 --> 00:38:05,115
You see him, you send
a hand signal up the line.

548
00:38:05,235 --> 00:38:08,748
And if I see that hand signal
before I see our infiltrator, you win.

549
00:38:09,241 --> 00:38:10,366
Exercise over.

550
00:38:10,928 --> 00:38:12,459
And where will you be?

551
00:38:15,615 --> 00:38:17,413
Looking for that hand signal.

552
00:38:17,917 --> 00:38:19,181
You're with me.

553
00:38:20,779 --> 00:38:21,752
You too.

554
00:38:29,406 --> 00:38:31,604
Those are detonators.
Claymore simulators.

555
00:38:31,931 --> 00:38:35,024
Here, here, and here.
Now you wait for the signal.

556
00:38:35,309 --> 00:38:37,811
You watch for me
to lead the infiltrator past this line.

557
00:38:37,931 --> 00:38:41,405
When he enters the kill zone, you hit
the detonator, the simulators go off.

558
00:38:42,204 --> 00:38:43,685
End of story.
We go home.

559
00:38:43,805 --> 00:38:44,805
Wait, sir.

560
00:38:44,925 --> 00:38:48,037
The last-minute change of mission?
Pre-positioned equipment?

561
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,789
Claymore simulators?

562
00:38:51,567 --> 00:38:52,370
What?

563
00:38:52,862 --> 00:38:54,314
We're not having fun?

564
00:38:55,872 --> 00:38:57,189
Son of a bitch!

565
00:38:57,309 --> 00:38:58,712
No, no, no, no!

566
00:38:59,371 --> 00:39:01,410
Got to be a little more specific.

567
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:05,388
Straight shot from one of the kids...
Must've hit one of the FPs.

568
00:39:05,768 --> 00:39:08,389
It's set them all off, a chain reaction.
We're just swinging in the wind.

569
00:39:08,509 --> 00:39:10,460
- Where's the ogre?
- It's coming to kill us all.

570
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,770
- Where the hell do you think it is?
- Where is the tank?

571
00:39:14,317 --> 00:39:16,956
About a block away.
Moving towards us.

572
00:39:17,076 --> 00:39:19,253
There's no way
we've got enough powder to kill it.

573
00:39:19,373 --> 00:39:22,189
I'm gonna lay down some covering fire,
maybe drop a couple endos.

574
00:39:22,309 --> 00:39:24,871
That'll give Kyle enough time
to get back.

575
00:39:24,991 --> 00:39:26,684
We can kill that ogre.

576
00:39:26,804 --> 00:39:28,411
We got one more magic bullet.

577
00:39:29,366 --> 00:39:31,286
We just gotta get it out there.

578
00:39:41,262 --> 00:39:44,227
"The Emerald City was
soon left far behind.

579
00:39:44,347 --> 00:39:48,247
"As they advanced,
the ground became rougher and hillier.

580
00:39:48,367 --> 00:39:51,973
"For there were no farms nor houses
in this country of the west.

581
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:54,320
"Before night,

582
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,437
"Dorothy, and Toto,
and the lion lay down

583
00:39:56,557 --> 00:39:58,336
"upon the grass and fell asleep,

584
00:39:58,456 --> 00:40:01,247
"with the Woodman
and the Scarecrow keeping watch.

585
00:40:06,296 --> 00:40:07,182
"Now,

586
00:40:07,302 --> 00:40:10,703
"the Wicked Witch had but one eye.
Yet she could see everywhere.

587
00:40:11,249 --> 00:40:13,211
"She saw Dorothy lying asleep,

588
00:40:13,575 --> 00:40:15,590
"with her friends all about her.

589
00:40:55,041 --> 00:40:56,895
"The Wicked Witch looked out
with her one eye.

590
00:40:57,517 --> 00:40:59,320
"She said to the king crow,

591
00:40:59,578 --> 00:41:01,539
"'fly at once to those strangers.'

592
00:41:01,879 --> 00:41:03,254
"'Peck out their eyes.'

593
00:41:03,374 --> 00:41:04,945
"'Tear them to pieces.'

594
00:41:16,082 --> 00:41:18,127
"The wild crows flew
in one great flock,

595
00:41:18,247 --> 00:41:20,427
"toward Dorothy and her companions.

596
00:41:20,749 --> 00:41:24,047
"When the little girl saw them coming,
she was afraid."

597
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:27,978
Come here.

598
00:41:32,622 --> 00:41:35,830
"But the Scarecrow said,
'This is my battle,

599
00:41:35,991 --> 00:41:38,598
'lie down beside me
and you will not be harmed.'"

600
00:42:26,858 --> 00:42:27,840
Look over here!

601
00:42:29,263 --> 00:42:30,528
It's me!
Connor!

602
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:31,925
John Connor!

603
00:42:36,391 --> 00:42:38,684
"The witch got into a terrible rage.

604
00:42:38,844 --> 00:42:41,417
"She couldn't understand how
all her plans to destroy the strangers

605
00:42:41,537 --> 00:42:42,674
"had failed.

606
00:42:42,794 --> 00:42:46,219
"There was only one way left
to destroy Dorothy and her friends."

607
00:42:48,611 --> 00:42:50,372
Want me to read for awhile?

608
00:42:59,188 --> 00:43:02,771
"The sky darkened and a low
rumbling sound was heard in the air.

609
00:43:03,328 --> 00:43:05,630
"There was a rushing of many wings,

610
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:09,387
"a great chattering and laughing,
and the sun came out of the dark sky

611
00:43:11,124 --> 00:43:14,007
"to show the Witch surrounded
by a crowd of monkeys.

612
00:43:15,195 --> 00:43:16,986
"'Go to the strangers
and destroy them all,'

613
00:43:17,106 --> 00:43:18,390
"said the Wicked Witch."

614
00:43:26,797 --> 00:43:29,066
"But Dorothy
they did not harm at all.

615
00:43:29,186 --> 00:43:30,872
"Careful and gently,
they lifted Dorothy

616
00:43:30,992 --> 00:43:33,293
in their arms and carried her
to the Witch."

617
00:43:51,035 --> 00:43:52,925
"The Witch looked into the child's eyes
and saw

618
00:43:53,085 --> 00:43:55,137
"how simple the soul
behind them was,

619
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:58,099
"and that she did not know
of her wonderful power.

620
00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:01,016
"The Witch said to Dorothy,
'Come with me;

621
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,812
"for if you do not,
I will make an end of you.'

622
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,273
"The little girl grew angry.

623
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:10,208
"'You are a wicked creature!'
she cried.

624
00:44:11,627 --> 00:44:14,191
"In her anger, she picked up
a bucket of water that stood near

625
00:44:14,311 --> 00:44:17,319
"and dashed it over the witch,
wetting her from head to foot.

626
00:44:17,547 --> 00:44:19,431
"The Witch gave a cry of fear.

627
00:44:19,746 --> 00:44:23,020
"As Dorothy looked in wonder,
the Witch began to shrink away.

628
00:44:23,811 --> 00:44:26,988
"'See what you have done!'
the Witch screamed. 'I shall melt away.'

629
00:44:28,978 --> 00:44:33,048
"With these words,
she fell into a melted shapeless mess.

630
00:44:34,539 --> 00:44:36,918
"The Wicked Witch had come
to an end.

631
00:44:38,465 --> 00:44:41,605
"Being at last free to do as she chose,
Dorothy ran,

632
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:44,822
no longer a prisoner
in a strange land."

633
00:45:23,113 --> 00:45:26,001
Six stops down,
there's a pay phone to call your mom.

634
00:45:26,562 --> 00:45:27,935
You got your money?

635
00:45:29,092 --> 00:45:31,941
If you get into trouble, you call me.
Say "book report" and I'll come.

636
00:45:32,061 --> 00:45:33,723
Whatever it is, I'll come.

637
00:45:45,362 --> 00:45:46,312
Are you a spy?

638
00:45:47,442 --> 00:45:48,768
No, I'm not a spy.

639
00:45:49,407 --> 00:45:50,581
Are you a mom?

640
00:45:51,185 --> 00:45:52,465
Yeah, I'm a mom.

641
00:45:53,464 --> 00:45:55,047
You kind of suck at it.

642
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:57,877
I know.
I'm working on it.

643
00:45:57,997 --> 00:45:59,626
Let's catch your bus.

644
00:46:14,203 --> 00:46:15,313
So this...

645
00:46:15,441 --> 00:46:17,377
this is what I'm supposed to do?

646
00:46:17,497 --> 00:46:19,354
Stay here, graduate,
go to West Point?

647
00:46:19,474 --> 00:46:21,573
Like I don't know the end
of the world is coming?

648
00:46:21,693 --> 00:46:24,272
Like any of this...
any of it really matters?

649
00:46:27,214 --> 00:46:28,434
It does matter.

650
00:46:30,106 --> 00:46:31,342
It all matters.

651
00:46:32,451 --> 00:46:33,794
You believe that?

652
00:46:38,293 --> 00:46:39,451
I've got to.

653
00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:48,183
I'll see you around, Connor.

654
00:46:50,511 --> 00:46:52,225
Yeah.
I guess you will.

655
00:47:08,072 --> 00:47:10,945
Sometimes I wish
I could just wake up from all this.

656
00:47:15,105 --> 00:47:16,603
Like from a dream.

657
00:47:23,187 --> 00:47:24,807
But I can't, can I?

658
00:47:26,843 --> 00:47:28,873
You want to know what happened...

659
00:47:28,993 --> 00:47:30,684
To Bedell...
what really happened?

660
00:47:32,871 --> 00:47:34,274
I don't know.
Do I?

661
00:47:37,275 --> 00:47:39,576
Guess it depends
on who I'm talking to.

662
00:47:40,186 --> 00:47:42,209
John Baum or John Connor.

663
00:47:46,026 --> 00:47:47,201
Baum is just a name.

664
00:47:57,272 --> 00:47:58,198
I'll go.

665
00:48:02,126 --> 00:48:03,926
- You'll never make it.
- He's my brother.

666
00:48:04,086 --> 00:48:06,319
You wanna save Kyle or die trying?

667
00:48:06,439 --> 00:48:08,055
Give me the damn EFP.

668
00:48:08,498 --> 00:48:09,345
Please.

669
00:48:12,209 --> 00:48:13,892
I wanna take this one.

670
00:48:16,497 --> 00:48:17,980
Run like hell, okay?

671
00:48:19,634 --> 00:48:21,472
Bedell, you run like hell.

672
00:48:24,317 --> 00:48:26,439
When this thing goes off,
you pop those wagons.

673
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:28,575
You get those people out.
Don't be a hero.

674
00:48:31,653 --> 00:48:32,440
Go!

675
00:48:38,936 --> 00:48:40,125
And he ran.

676
00:48:40,512 --> 00:48:41,886
He ran so fast.

677
00:48:46,718 --> 00:48:50,168
Fast enough to get to that tank
before it got to Kyle's position.

678
00:48:51,084 --> 00:48:53,107
Fast enough to blow it sky-high.

679
00:49:00,372 --> 00:49:02,409
We rescued 40 prisoners that day.

680
00:49:05,261 --> 00:49:07,099
One of them was John Connor.

681
00:49:14,999 --> 00:49:17,115
Martin was always a great runner.

682
00:49:19,403 --> 00:49:20,562
But no one...

683
00:49:21,202 --> 00:49:23,441
no one could outrun a blast
like that.

684
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,523
He died, John.

685
00:49:33,948 --> 00:49:35,260
He died for you.

686
00:49:39,872 --> 00:49:41,245
We all die for you.
