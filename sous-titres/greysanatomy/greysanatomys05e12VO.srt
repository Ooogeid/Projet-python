1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:04,980
my mother used to  say
this about residency--

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:08,710
it takes a year  to learn how to cut...

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,310
it takes a lifetime  to learn not to.

4
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:14,970
I'm up.I'm here.

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,430
What's going on?

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,150
Uh,jackson's B.P.,It's a
little down from yesterday.

7
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,360
No big deal,but if we
make a few calls,get pushy,

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,630
maybe we could get him bumped up a
few spots up on the transplant list.

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:31,190
dr. Baey,you-- you paged me 9-1-1
at 2:30 in the morning uh,to chat?

10
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:34,420
Uh,you... like to chat.

11
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:36,980
- You're chatty.
- Not at 2:30 in the morning.

12
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,470
Look,he's young.He--he's
near the top of the list.

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,910
U.N.O.S.Will find him his organs
when they find him his organs.

14
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,400
And god knowthat staying up all night
chatting about it is not gonna help.

15
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,680
I'm gonna go get some sleep.

16
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,670
I suggest you do the same.

17
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,050
He's running out of time.

18
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,160
They always are.

19
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,060
Welcome to peds.

20
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,090
Of all of e tools  on a surgical tray...

21
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,840
sound judgment is the
trickiest one to master.

22
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,530
And without it,we're all just toddlers
running around with 10-blades.

23
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:16,050
Oh,I asked them not to wake you.

24
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,850
I said,"whatever it is,it
can wait till morning.

25
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,350
dr. Shepherd needs his beauty sleep.

26
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:25,910
" Your latest head C.T.Shows that
the brain contusions are expanding.

27
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:28,070
I'm gonna get you into
the O.R. Right away.

28
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:32,040
This--this brain
thing,it--it could kill me?

29
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:33,960
If we don't treat it,yes.

30
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,450
you find that funny?

31
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:41,010
I'm sorry.It's just that they're
gonna execute me in five days.

32
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,280
Five days.

33
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:47,740
Might as well take my chances
with this brain thing,right?

34
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,950
- mr. Dunn-- you gotta
admit,it's a nice way to go-

35
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:57,590
plenty of attractive females...
all the jell-o I could want.

36
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,220
Have you tried the strawberry?

37
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,720
- It'll change your life.
- You're refusing surgery?

38
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,000
Either way,I'm going
to die,dr. Shepherd.

39
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,610
Might as well do it on your watch.

43
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,740
why do you have to live
in meredith's attic?

44
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,400
How am I supposed to sneak out of here
with that frat pty going on downstairs?

45
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,300
Don't you kids ever sleep?

46
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,940
They're cleaning the house
for dr. Shepherd's mother.

47
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,160
mrs. Scoming?

48
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,570
- To seattle?
- So?

49
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,090
So that woman practically raised
me,taught me right from wrong,

50
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:45,180
and if she found out that I
was... with you,that we were...

51
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,790
you're meredith grey's little sister.

52
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,540
You are forbidden fruit.

53
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,880
You are 25.

54
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,290
- You're a fetus.
- 24.

55
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,470
I skipped third grade.

56
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,630
I feel dirty.

57
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,050
10 bucks says she tanks
in the first 5 minutes.

58
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,530
I have faith in death.Shll
make a good impression.

59
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,850
She's holding that bottle of
tequila like it's a life vest.

60
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,590
Mer,don't listen to them.

61
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,200
- She's gonna love you.
- No.Mothers don't love me.

62
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,340
Mothers like bright and
bubbly and happy and... izzie.

63
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,110
Mothers love izzie.

64
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:18,050
They do.Mothers do love izzie.

65
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,230
My mother would've loved you.

66
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:23,820
Uh,I stashed all the tequila,took
the condoms out of the cookie jar.

67
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:29,760
I also replaced all your trashy magazines with
back issues of the "annals of surgery," okay?

68
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,860
does it smell musty in here?

69
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,010
My mom's house smells like peppermint.

70
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,940
- It's so homey.
- My house isn't homey?

71
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,650
- I feel at home.
- I was raised in a hellhole.

72
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,020
- This place is a palace.
- Why isn't my house homey,george?

73
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,580
I can't explain it.It's just a feeling.

74
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,130
Well,izzie can't fix a feeling.

75
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,940
She is freaking out,people.Just
tell her something I can fix.

76
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,170
Rebecca peed on that couch cushion.

77
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,550
I've been sleeping there for weeks.

78
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,040
Thanks,alex.You're... a good friend.

79
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,180
You're welcome.Keep drinking.

80
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,970
- Ma.
- Hey,there you are.

81
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:09,770
- *****
- I probably,uh,shoulda called first.

82
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,270
Hey,I hear your mom's coming into town.

83
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,880
Good times.

84
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,800
you'll be fine.

85
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,650
Just keep the talking to a minimum.

86
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,610
Short.Short little nuggets of meredith--
that's all anyone really needs.

87
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:24,260
And if you start to
get stuck,just smile.

88
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:27,010
You have a really great smile.

89
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,310
Ooh.That's just scary.

90
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,530
Um,mer,are you sure you want
to wear your hair like that?

91
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,950
You're wearing an
alarmingly high ponytail.

92
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,400
Your mother is coming.

93
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:05,020
mr. Dunn,the swelling in your
brain is increasing rapidly.

94
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,860
The longer we wait to
operate,the worse it gets.

95
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,820
Excellent.

96
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,500
- Go,team.
- I strongly suggest you reconsider surgery.

97
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,030
Have you ever seen the inside
of a maximum security prison?

98
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:22,560
Ie,this is the place to
do it,in good company.

99
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,360
You two will vigilantly monitor
mr. Dunn's elevating I.C.P.S.

100
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,690
You will do hourly neuro exams.

101
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:31,000
When he goes unconscious,which
he will,we'll rush him to rgery.

102
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,540
You can't do that.

103
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,350
Can--can--can
he do that?

104
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,480
When you're unconscious and can no
longer make sound medical decisions,

105
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,750
a 2-doctor consent is all
that's needed to treat you.

106
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:42,570
For god sake,I'm gonna be dead
as a doornail in five days.

107
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,670
- dr. Grey,you're a reasonable
- we're done here.

108
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,560
Would you fix a broken television
before you throw it out?

109
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:48,720
He's got a point.

110
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,840
He's trying to cheat the system,and
we're not gonna let him do it.

111
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,330
What's the problem?

112
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:58,770
I have a little infection from
a little surgery I had done.

113
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,420
Yeah,in hong kong.

114
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,840
My crazy-ass brother went and got
crazy-ass elective surgery in hong kong.

115
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,420
- Who does that?
- Short people.

116
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,060
Desperate short people.

117
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,200
I had my legs lengthened.

118
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,240
I couldn't find a surgeon
who would do it here.

119
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,960
Look,it's barbaric,okay?

120
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:20,190
They--they broke his legsand they hooked him
up to some sort of medieval torture device.

121
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,760
Yeah,that's to pull the bones apart.

122
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:27,360
That's the lengthening process.It's a
controversial procedure.I don't perform it myself.

123
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,760
- Could I take a look?
- Yeah.

124
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,020
they said it'd give me 2 whole inches.

125
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,610
Any word from U.N.O.S.?

126
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:46,160
Not yet.dr. Karev is staying
in constant contact with them.

127
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,950
How much longer will we have to wait?

128
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,600
Are--are livers and
intestines hard to find?

129
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,550
Well,jackson's blood
type is o-positive.

130
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,460
It shouldn't be too difficult to match.

131
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,030
But he's had blood transfusions,which
means there could be extra antibodies

132
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:04,190
that are hard to match,so we
need to be patient,melinda.

133
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:10,170
In the meantime,um,I need to run some
tests on jackson to check his electrolytes.

134
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:13,630
we're gonna do everything we can
to help your son,mrs.Prescott.

135
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,350
All of us.

136
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,960
you.You're squirrelly.

137
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,110
I'm sorry?

138
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:23,410
I don't trust you.I don't
trust you in this hospital

139
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:28,190
and I certainly don't trust you with my patient
of three years who's extremely important.

140
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,450
- I
- zz.

141
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,760
If you want to stay on this
case,you will stay out of my way,

142
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:37,700
you will do what I tell you,and if you have
something to say to or about my patient,

143
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:41,340
you will raise your hand
and wait to be called on.

144
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,420
You--you've got
to be kidding me.

145
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:53,640
yes.

146
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,010
This is a joke,right?

147
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,460
Do I look like I'm laughing?

148
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,550
You're upset.

149
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,640
I don't get upset with patients.

150
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,400
You're mad at me for
killing those women.

151
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,200
I get that.

152
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:13,580
Would you feel differently if you
knew that I was beaten as a child?

153
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,610
Every day.

154
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,320
It's how I learned to read.

155
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:23,930
I-I used to hide under the sink and sound
out the letters on the detergent box.

156
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,560
Is that true?

157
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,860
Did it make you feel better?

158
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,840
Whatever helps you
sleep at night,dr. Grey.

159
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,680
Did you do something bad?

160
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,250
Traffic violation.

161
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,200
what's wrong with you,kid?

162
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:58,380
I need a new liver and a new intestine.

163
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,860
Yeah?

164
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,440
You want mine?

165
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,010
Are you in the north terminal?

166
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,220
Well,that's where she's supposed to be.

167
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:15,260
No,no,do-don't go anywhere.Just wait.

168
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,700
Never mind.I found her.

169
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:19,390
You know,there's a town car
waiting for you at the airport.

170
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:22,540
I don't need a fancy car.I just
hopped on the bus.Saved you some money.

171
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:25,910
So this cruise... you just happened
to have a layover in seattle?

172
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,620
Well,I've always wanted to
check out the space needle.

173
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,240
I understand you can see
mount rainer from the top.

174
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:33,110
Oh,really?Anything else
you want to check out?

175
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,420
You gonna take me or not?

176
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,940
I got back-to-back
surgeries,ma.

177
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,260
You gotta give me a little more notice.

178
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:39,590
Yeah,yeah.I gave birth to five doctors.

179
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,860
I know the drill.

180
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,880
I can wait,maybe meet your colleagues.

181
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,700
- Is that mark sloan?
- Yeah.

182
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,920
Mark sloan.

183
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,770
Oh,mrs.Shepherd.You look great.

184
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,340
Oh,damn.Catch up later?

185
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,900
Uh,oh,perfect timing.

186
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,610
Um,mom,this is meredith.

187
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,200
Meredith,finally.

188
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:04,610
My son has been acting like a dog
with his favorite bone,hiding you away.

189
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,100
I hope you're free for lunch.

190
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,810
I can't wait to dive in
and find out all about you.

191
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,100
Mer looks weird.

192
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,510
Does she look weird to you?

193
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:13,880
she looks like she's
gonna pee her pants.

194
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:16,380
Oh,crap.I made her hydrate.

195
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,100
Meeting the family always
blows.I'd never make you do that.

196
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,620
Me,either.

197
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,100
One of the many perks
of dating a dead guy.

198
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,390
Who's that lady touching meredith?

199
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,510
Derek's mom.

200
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,760
Oh,that's why she looks so weird.

201
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,640
She does not look weird,okay?

202
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,760
I've got it under
control.Mer is doing... great.

203
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,510
Looks like she's gonna pee.

204
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:46,650
dr. Yang,you mind checking on some of
my post-ops?E.R. Is swamped with traumas.

205
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,230
Also,would you like to
go on a date with me?

206
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,960
I'm sorry?

207
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,390
A date.

208
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,190
You said not to play hot and cold with
you,so,um,I'll pick you up around 8:00?

209
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:06,290
Oh,and make sure mr. Kenner in room 2-2-1-2 gets
that enema.He's been holding on to it for days.

210
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,460
okay.

211
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,360
'Cause that wasn't weird.

212
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:20,200
see,another perk of dating a
dead guy-- no awkward dates.

213
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:22,650
2-to-1,but
who's counting?

214
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,760
Why can't I have that nice man's organs?

215
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,410
He offered.

216
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:32,000
You know how in school,there
are rules you have to follow?

217
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:33,810
Well,the same goes for here.

218
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:38,000
We have to follow the rules,or
else we get in big trouble.

219
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:42,080
And what that man offered you...
was definitely against the rules.

220
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,680
She's fighting with the
insurance people again.

221
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:49,200
You're not supposed to
worry about stuff like that.

222
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:57,530
Tell her something good today,even if
nothing good happens,she needs good news.

223
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:04,140
I've got a body full of--
of high-quality parts here.

224
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,040
3-day liquidatn sale.

225
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,830
Everything must go.

226
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,650
Even if we could do it,you
have to be a match for him,

227
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,840
which means we'd have to
crossmatch your blood with his.

228
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:17,490
Good thing we're both
in a hospital then.

229
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:24,150
let--let me save
a life before I go.

230
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:28,320
It's the--it's
the least I can do.

231
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:33,770
So you really expect me to believe
that you want to do this for a kid?

232
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,560
Whatever helps you
sleep at night,dr. Grey.

233
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,060
The infection's made its
way deep into the bone,

234
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,860
so we're gonna have to take
the rods out of your legs...

235
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,240
and clean out the
dead,infected skin and bone.

236
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,350
You mean I won't get my 2
inches?All that pain for nothing?

237
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,970
mr. Ruben,at this point,you're
lucky to keep your legs at all.

238
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,570
Yeah,that's easy for you to say.

239
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,120
What are you,5'10",5'11"?

240
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,190
Leave the doctors,alone,chuck.They're
just trying to help.

241
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,590
Oh,shut up,gary.

242
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,590
You are over 6 feet tall.

243
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:12,640
Do you have any idea what it's like to have
everybody you know literally look down on you?

244
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,870
Or how humiliating it is to have to ask for
help from a teenager at the grocery store

245
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,650
'cause you can't reach the top shelf?

246
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,780
I've gone on two dat in the last six
months,both with women I met over the internet,

247
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:27,880
and hey,no one wants to see me again
because no one wants to date the short guy.

248
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,720
- Chuck-- I wanted
those 2 inches,gary.

249
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,040
I nted them so bad.

250
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,560
It's 2 inches.

251
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,730
I mean,wh-what's the difference
between 5'3" and 5'5"?

252
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:45,250
5'5" you can say out loud.

253
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:54,360
Okay,I made a list of the best
pediatric G.I.S in the country.

254
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:58,760
I figure,between the two of us,we can get one of
these guys to come down and do a tips procedure on him.

255
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:00,650
Doing a tips on a kid
who needs a new liver?

256
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,760
- Yeah.- That--that's like putting
a band-aid on a bullet wound.

257
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,680
- Well,you have a better idea?
- I do.

258
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,670
Waiting for
U.N.O.S.Trusting the process.

259
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,030
W-why can't you do that?

260
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,870
Because I'm tired of waiting
while this kid is getting worse.

261
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,680
Jackson's tired.His mother is,too.

262
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:17,640
The only one who's happy to sit on her
ass and twiddle her thumbs and wait is you!

263
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,130
Whoa.I have been patient
with you.I have been nice.

264
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,030
But I am really over you... hey.

265
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,710
Constantly telling me how to do my job.

266
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,960
- Okay,somebody
has to-- dr. Bailey.

267
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:25,780
I've got 20 other
kids in this hospital¡ª

268
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,250
- I'm concerned about this one child
- shut up!

269
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:30,780
Respectfully,all right?

270
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,360
Respectfully,shut up.

271
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,030
Because we've got organs.

272
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:41,420
******

273
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,800
I hate flying.

274
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,880
I always feel much closer to death
on a plane than in the O.R. Don't you?

275
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,970
I do now.

276
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,180
I met izzie the other day.

277
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,240
She's very pretty.

278
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:57,450
So you--you think
she's the one?

279
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,200
I-I don't know.

280
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,800
Well,I mean,we're at that age,right?

281
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,980
Marriage,babies... that the plan?

282
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,780
I don't know!

283
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:10,220
I'm sorry.I-I don't make plans,okay?

284
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:11,970
If there's a future there,great.

285
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,110
If not,whatever.I'll
get over it.I always do.

286
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:16,290
Okay?

287
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,410
Okay.

288
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,290
I think it's nice.

289
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,910
Your date.

290
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,070
I think you and the pig murderer
make a really good couple.

291
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,140
Okay.

292
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,650
What are you gonna do on your
date?What are you nna talk about?

293
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,540
- Why do you care?
- Yeah,why do you care?

294
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,050
You only get to do a first date once.

295
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:41,700
It should be... fun and sexy
and... ask really good questions.

296
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,560
Ask him why he first decided
he wanted to save lives.

297
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,190
Ooh,ask him what his
best surgery ever was.

298
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:47,180
I know how to go on a date.

299
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:50,210
Why is meredith eating pot roast?

300
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:53,810
It's a show lunch for the mommy.

301
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,190
She's freaking out.That
ponytail?It's gonna blow.

302
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:01,230
Derek tells me you--you,uh,grew
up right here in seattle.

303
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:03,720
Are your parents... mm.

304
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,480
Dead.

305
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,780
Mer's mother died last year.

306
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:11,170
Oh,I'm so sorry.

307
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,850
And your father?

308
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:19,340
Oh.You know,I... should go check on
the patient who's the serial killer...

309
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,080
who's here.

310
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:24,690
Not killing people,so that's good.

311
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,020
- I should go.
- Yeah.

312
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,820
Family isn't her favorite topic,okay?

313
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,720
She's had a rough time of it.

314
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:39,820
- I didn't say a word.
- I know what you're thinking.

315
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:46,750
I was thinking... it
must be awful for you...

316
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:50,110
treating a murderer.

317
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:56,830
Dad died a long time ago.I'm fine.

318
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,470
Grey,what are you doing?

319
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,840
If you sleep with me,you
lunch with me.New rule.

320
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,970
You let interns sit with
you at lunch,dr. Sloan?

321
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,900
That is so cool.

322
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,750
Oh,you want to go halfsies
with me on that cookie?

323
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,560
uh,what are you gonna
trade me for it,huh?

324
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,590
You guys,they have tater tots!

325
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,750
I have to go.

326
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,400
Mark.

327
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,890
Mrs. Shepherd.

328
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,560
- You've been avoiding me.
- What?

329
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:30,790
You have that same guilty look on your face as you did
- when you were 10 years old

330
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:33,880
and you put derek's favorite
frog into the microwave.

331
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,450
I never pressed "start.

332
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,710
" What's going on?

333
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,800
I'm sleeping with her.

334
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:46,010
Oh,mark!Not again.

335
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,470
- How could you?
- No,no.

336
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,080
No,not meredith.

337
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:51,460
God,no.

338
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:53,960
Meredith's ltle sister.

339
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,930
Which one is she?

340
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,440
The,uh,the... one with the juice box.

341
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,490
Are my new organs here yet?

342
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,650
Mm,not yet.

343
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,860
But we're gonna get you all prepped now.

344
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,340
So that we can put them in
as soon as they get here.

345
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:16,220
When you wake up,you're gonna be
a brand-neboy with brand-new parts.

346
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,240
I can't believe this is it.

347
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:22,630
The thought of us getting to live
our lives outside of this hospital...

348
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,780
- don't get me wrong,miranda.I
- love our chats.

349
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,690
But it'll be nice not
to see my face every day?

350
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,050
so freakin' nice.

351
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,870
it's just a kid.

352
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,670
Yep.Let's go get his organs.

353
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,770
Am I hallucinating,or is
that a really high ponytail?

354
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,750
you're not hallucinating.

355
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:01,170
But once your brain starts to
herniate,I can't promise anything.

356
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:05,030
So I'm really circling the drain here?

357
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,690
You should just take my organs
right now,help that poor kid.

358
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,460
Oh,they found him organs.They're
flying them over right now.

359
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,250
He's gonna be fine.

360
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,180
did you know that they let you choose?

361
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:33,530
Hanging or lethal-- you get
to pick your poison,literally.

362
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:38,310
Which one would you choose?

363
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:44,460
medically speaking,which
one'S... better?

364
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:54,390
well,with hanging,your neck
breaks,which severs your spinal cord,

365
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,020
which causes your blood
pressure to drop to nothing,

366
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,710
and you lose consciousness.

367
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:01,300
You don't actually die
for several minutes.

368
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:05,740
And with lethal injection,they
inject an anesthetic first,

369
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:09,360
which puts you to
sleep,and then a paralytic,

370
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:13,200
which stops your diaphragm and
your lungs,and then potassium,

371
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,600
which stops your heart.

372
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,330
was,um...

373
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:29,420
was I a match?

374
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,550
yes,you were.

375
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:57,620
Can I help you with something?
Were you looking for Dr. Shep--

376
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,910
are you a good girl?

377
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,570
I--what?

378
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,010
A good girl.

379
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,070
I don't mean perfect.
I mean...

380
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,600
relatively speaking.

381
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,700
- Are you?
- Yes.

382
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:15,190
How many sexual partners have you had?
I won't judge.
Um...

383
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,650
six.

384
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,860
No,s-seven.

385
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,110
K-kinda six.

386
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,510
But kinda seven.

387
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,560
- Criminal record?
- Speeding ticket.

388
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,510
- How fast?
- 12 miles or.

389
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:28,140
That's fast.
Well,it wasn't too-- it wa--it was way too fast.

390
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:31,700
But I was--I was downhill and I was--ias-- I was coasting,ma'am.

391
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:36,020
Now I don't suppose you can tell me...

392
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,110
where the gift shop is?

393
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,990
first floor,east wing.

394
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,490
it's like pudding in here.

395
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:55,870
this is exactly why I don't do this procedure.

396
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:58,190
I mean,you're living with broken legs for months.

397
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:00,330
You're in excruciating pain.

398
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,930
God,all for a few inches.

399
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,100
pain and agony for a little bit of pleasure.

400
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,720
I get it.

401
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,330
If it's that bad,why don't you just stop sleep--

402
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:15,880
- doing what you're doing?
- Because it doesn't feel bad when I'M...

403
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,480
doing it.

404
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,990
it's good.
It's great.

405
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,030
and maybe if you weren't so scared of getting burned,

406
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:25,040
you'd feel the same.

407
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,730
you know,I used to walk tall around here.

408
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,820
I used to walk tall.

409
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,140
Then...

410
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,160
came george.

411
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,460
He took off at least an inch.

412
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:42,040
Then erica went and left me.
That shaved off a few more.

413
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,660
I got shorter.

414
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:48,220
All that humiliation,it makes you shorter.
So,yeah,I am scared of getting hurt

415
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:51,360
because one more personal disaster right now would cut me off at the knees.

416
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:02,390
so,uh,valentine's day?

417
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:05,120
Personally,I mean,I think you can't go wrong with jewelry.

418
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:08,940
If you want,I can recommend some local plac-- what is wrong with you?

419
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:10,280
What?

420
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,060
We just took a liver and an intestine from a little kid--

421
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,970
a dead little kid-- and you don't even care.

422
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:19,850
You're talking about rainbows and relationships and crap.

423
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:23,060
What the hell is wrong with you?

424
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:30,150
You don't think that I know that they just pulled the plug on a kid?

425
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,330
You don't think I get that?

426
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,670
You don't think I know about the tiny,tiny coffin they're gonna stick him in?

427
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:41,370
I know about the tiny coffins.

428
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:43,390
I see them all the time,

429
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,300
in my sleep.

430
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,220
So if you don't mind,I'm gonna keep talki

431
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:51,300
relationships and rainbows and crap,

432
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:54,510
and I'm gonna make plans for tomorrow,

433
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,640
because that's what you do,karev.

434
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,460
You make plans.

435
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,270
You have to.

436
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:04,940
You turn your back on the tiny coffins

437
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,010
and you face forward...

438
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,880
to the next kid.

439
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:18,860
- So how's our death row guy?
- Oh,he's pissing me off.

440
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,250
He has blossoming brain contusions now,and he's refusing surgery.

441
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,290
He thinks that's gonna get him a stay of execution?

442
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:25,250
No,he'd just like to die here.

443
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,300
He wants to control it,wants to choose.

444
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,000
I went a little overboard buying bears for your nieces.

445
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,440
- Mom,this is major owen hunt.
- Major?

446
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,540
I was navy nurse for 25 years.

447
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,370
- Where were you stationed,major hunt?
- In the thick of it,in iraq.

448
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:39,980
Welcome home.
You must have stories.

449
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,560
Not any worth telling,ma'am.

450
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:50,490
- I finished your post-ops.
- Thank you,Dr. Yang.

451
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:59,590
So what was your best surgery ever?

452
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,190
- What?
- Nothing.
I,uh...

453
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,910
stupid.

454
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,740
- finishing the vena cava.
- Anastamosis looks good.

455
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:11,240
Now all that's left is to release the clamps.

456
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,810
You should do the honors,miranda.
He's your patient.

457
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:20,570
thank you,Dr. Robbins.

458
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,010
call on me.

459
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,480
call on me.

460
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,950
Call on me!

461
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:47,810
There's a spot on the duodenum.

462
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,140
What the hell is that?

463
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,490
- I don't feel too good.
- I.C.P.Is critical.Is critical.

464
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:54,080
We have to get him down to the O.R,

465
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:55,910
No.
No.

466
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:57,910
We have to get you to surgery.

467
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,700
I'm not scared of dying.

468
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,550
I just don't want to do it strapped down to a table like some

469
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,670
a-animal.

470
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:07,780
Please,please...

471
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,540
please,Dr. Grey...

472
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:12,650
let me go.

473
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:17,160
push the paralytics.

474
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:23,400
Okay,start bagging him.
Intubate and get him into the O.R.

475
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,950
I need another doctor's signature...

476
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:28,170
consent to operate...

477
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,000
all right,sign.

478
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,120
sign the form.

479
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,650
Meredith,sign the form.

480
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:38,820
meredith!
Sign the form.

481
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:44,830
yang,you're scrubbing in.

482
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:53,510
******************Is there a source?

483
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:57,390
This can't be happening.
This just cannot be happening,not to this little boy.

484
00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:00,540
- This is not happening.
This is not happening.
- These organs are dead,Dr. Bail

485
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:03,180
they're making him sicker.
Keeping them in is doing him more harm than good.

486
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,940
- Sir,maybe if- - he will die if you leave them in.

487
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,940
He'll die if we take them out,sir.

488
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:13,110
maybe we could try a portacaval shunt.
It'll keep the circulation going and bypass the liver.

489
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:16,590
- That's just a temporary fix.
- Anybody got any better ideas?

490
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,750
Then I don't see what choice we have,Dr. Bailey.

491
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:23,160
- How much time do we have to find him new organs?
- 24 hours.

492
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,040
Get some more laps in there,too.

493
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,640
We're gonna put this piece of skull in Mr. Dunn's abdomen.

494
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,810
Why?

495
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:35,440
To allow the swelling in the brain to resolve.

496
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,780
The circulation of the abdomen preserves the bone marrow of the skull piece.

497
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:41,390
Very good.

498
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:43,610
Thanks for letting me scrub in.

499
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:46,220
I guess we finally see eye to eye on something.

500
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:53,570
are we ever gonna find out why it clotted off?

501
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:56,440
Sometimes the body-- the pieces just break.

502
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:59,760
- I'm like that.
- Yeah?

503
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,250
You dying for no good reason?

504
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:06,800
No,my life is in pieces...

505
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,920
all the time.
And...

506
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,890
and they just keep breaking.
And as soon as I fix one,another one goes down.

507
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:16,930
Listen,I'm not trying to piss you off by being here.
I'm just trying to...

508
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:19,760
keep it together,you know,piece by pce.

509
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,170
That ponytail...

510
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,160
looks ridiculous.

511
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,950
- She's a lovely girl.
- A lovely girl who's off-limits.

512
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:12,890
Baloney.
She isn't the problem.
You are.

513
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:16,210
You have very low expectations for yourself,mark sloan.

514
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:18,300
Since you were a little boy,you always have.

515
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,450
And it's time to raise them.

516
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:21,810
She's 24.

517
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:25,090
You have the emotional maturityof a horny 15 year old.

518
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,910
You need young.

519
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:33,080
so we had to shave off about a quarter-inch of leg bone in order to save the legs.

520
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,570
You mean I'm shorter?

521
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:39,780
I'm a quarter of an inch shorter?

522
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:42,010
It's a quarter-inch.
It's not a big deal.

523
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,420
Yeah?

524
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:47,230
I am under 5'3".

525
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:50,220
I am 5'2 and 3/4s?

526
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:54,660
Oh,no,but,hey,uh,maybe I could still just squeeze over that height requirement at the amusement park.

527
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,530
Oh!

528
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:59,000
Do you know why I never played varsity basketball?

529
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,450
- 'Cause you didn't make the team?
- No,no,no.

530
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:04,120
I-I didn't try out for the team

531
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,620
because I didn't want to make you feel bad for being too short to play.

532
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:11,400
even now,if I have a bad day,I can't even talk to my own brother about it,

533
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,420
because maybe you had a bad day,and you're short.

534
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:18,210
I couldn't even get depressed about lori leaving me

535
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:20,890
because you don't have a girlfriend and you're short!

536
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:22,270
And by the way,

537
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:25,090
the reason you don't have a girlfriend-- it's not because you're short.

538
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:28,790
It's because all you ever do is talk about being short!

539
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,470
No one knows how short you are except for you,dude.

540
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:36,900
No one cares.

541
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:45,800
I'm an ass,aren't I?

542
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,410
Yeah.

543
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:51,080
And you're short.

544
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,580
Good night,Mrs. Shepherd.
Nice to meet you.

545
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:59,080
Major hunt,how have you been sleeping?

546
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:01,200
I'm sorry?

547
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,640
When I can't sleep,I use valerian root.

548
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,630
I know you doctors don't think much of herbs,but I find it helps.

549
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,980
Have you been sleeping...

550
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,190
since you came back?

551
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,450
I'm fine,ma'am.
I...

552
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:17,630
sleep just fine.

553
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,680
Good night.

554
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:26,800
- How does your head feel,Mr. Dunn?
- Why didn't you just let me go?

555
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:28,500
You're not dying here.

556
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:32,290
What are you so scared of,Dr. Shepherd,losing control?

557
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:36,860
I.C.P.S are stable.
Continue neuro exaMs. And keep an eye on his blood pressure.
I don't want it dropping overnight.

558
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,270
Sure.

559
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:43,170
Or maybe you know that,deep down,you're no better than I am.

560
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:45,720
You decide who lives and dies all the time,

561
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,400
but for you,they call it medicine,not a capital offense.

562
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,100
Nobody gets to choose,

563
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,790
not me,

564
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:55,770
not a patient in this hospital,

565
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:57,990
and certainly not the five women you slaughtered.

566
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:00,590
So when I say you're not gonna diin this hospital,

567
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:02,000
I mean

568
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,100
there is no way in hell I will let you die

569
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,290
in this hospital.

570
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:10,890
You don't get off that easy.

571
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:15,230
I am nothing like you.

572
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,650
Meredith,I just looking for Derek

573
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,700
I thought you'd be with him.

574
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,590
you seem like a very nice person.

575
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,760
You've been very kind,and you've gen me a chance.

576
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:38,410
And it seems like you want to like me.

577
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:42,270
So it's only fair you should know...

578
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:46,810
the pink and the ponytail and the smiling with t teeth

579
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,630
I'm a fraud.
It's fake.

580
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:52,730
I'm not the kind of girl mothers like.

581
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:54,890
I'm not happy and bubbly.

582
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,820
I'm dark and cloudy,

583
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:59,780
because I'm the type of crazy person who...

584
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:03,330
feels bad for serial killers.

585
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:10,300
It was very nice to meet you,meredith.

586
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,560
What's wrong?

587
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,750
I want to meet your mother.

588
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:39,790
Iz.

589
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,560
I want to go on a date with you,denny.

590
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,870
I want to...

591
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:46,600
eat dinner at a restaurant and not look like a crazy person talking to myself.

592
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,750
I want to walk down the street with you and hold your hand.

593
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,400
I want to tell my friends about you.

594
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,090
I want...

595
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,790
I want...

596
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,810
what?

597
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,000
I want you alive.

598
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,800
Are you breaking up with me,izzie stevens?

599
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,580
I think I am.

600
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:30,310
- you want to get a drink?
- I would,but I have plans.

601
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:32,880
Right.

602
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,020
Walk tall.

603
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,130
What?

604
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,270
All you can do is be brave enough to get out there.

605
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,350
You fought.
You loved.

606
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:49,240
You lost.

607
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:52,010
Walk tall,torres.

608
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:03,020
You're lat you're really late.
They probably closed the kitchen.

609
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:05,650
I didn't want you to thi that I stood you up.

610
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,840
Are you drunk?

611
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:17,280
I haven't been on a date in a five years,since before I entered the military,

612
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:21,130
and I-- I just wanted to take the edge off.
- You're drunk?
You're late and drunk?

613
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:24,300
I will make this up to you,I promise.
This is not what you deserve.

614
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:28,230
I know this is not what you deserve,and I will make is up to y,I-I promise.

615
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:31,460
Okay,before you say anything else,Dr. Good times,you need to shower.

616
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:34,260
You smell like a distillery.

617
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,480
No.
Not here.
I...

618
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:43,420
your father...

619
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:46,350
always wanted you to have this for the right girl.

620
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,840
Addie wasn't right,clearly.

621
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,440
You spent less than an hour witheredith.

622
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:02,160
You rely even know her.

623
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,940
I know enough.

624
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,840
I know...

625
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:09,130
it's easier to have compassion for a good person than a murderer.

626
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:13,000
I know how angry you still are about what happened to dad.

627
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,920
Of course I'm angry.

628
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:18,560
Aren't you?

629
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:24,700
I still can't sleep on his side of the bed.

630
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:28,130
The mattre is wearing unevenly.

631
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,460
But no...

632
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,010
no,I'm not angry,not anymore.

633
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,170
Sweetheart.

634
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,300
You see things in black and white.

635
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,250
Meredith doesn'T.

636
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:48,210
No.

637
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:50,640
You need a spoonful of that.

638
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:52,830
You need her.

639
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:58,810
She's the one.

640
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:07,900
yang!
Yang!

641
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:14,410
I thought of it.
I thought of my best surgery ever.

642
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:17,850
- You're weari shoes in my shower.
- My first blast injury in theield.

643
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:20,910
The body was mangled-- homemade explosive device,

644
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:23,960
cooper and wires embedded 5 inches deep in the abdomen,

645
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,320
arms and legs hanging on by threads of skin.

646
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,670
I'd never seen anything like it,not in a textbook,not in residency.

647
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:32,130
Incredible,body full of holes--

648
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:35,320
traumaurgeon's dream.

649
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:39,120
I put tourniquets on where I could,started tying off the arteries with my bare hands,

650
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:42,450
but the bleeding was everywhere-- stomach,chest.

651
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:45,190
The best pressure I could think of was my own body,

652
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:48,840
so I-I laid there for two hours on top of him,

653
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:52,900
just not moving,trying to keep that dam from bursting with my hands,

654
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:56,040
my knees,my elbows.

655
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:59,170
Body

656
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:01,270
full of holes,

657
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,380
and he never bled ou I wouldn't let him.

658
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:08,550
He made it to the hospital,he made it home.
A month later,he...

659
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:13,310
he sent me a letter thanking me for saving his life,and then he shot himself.

660
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,310
That was my best surgery.

661
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:30,370
And my worst.

662
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,260
We're human.

663
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,980
We make mistakes.

664
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,490
We misestimate...

665
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:49,030
we call it wrong.

666
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:06,400
But when a surgeon makes a bad judgment call,

667
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,400
it's not as simple.

668
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,140
So,uh,

669
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:13,040
I checked,and,uh,we have a few vacation days coming up.

670
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,620
Maybe we could take a road trip?

671
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:18,060
Stop in iowa,see some corn?

672
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,480
- Doesn't your mom live in iowa?
- Yeah.

673
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,280
I think she'd like to meet you.

674
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,070
Or not.

675
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:31,450
Bad idea.
Forget it.

676
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,960
There's a bottle of tequila in the laundry room that has our name on it.

677
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:45,020
Don't move.

678
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,850
alex...

679
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:03,980
we gotta talk.

680
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,500
People get hurt.

681
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:12,130
They bleed.

682
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:15,530
I'm so sorry.I just heard.
What happens now?

683
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:18,390
Now we wait for a miracle.

684
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:25,710
So we struggle over every stitch.

685
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,390
We agonize...

686
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:34,640
over every suture.

687
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:43,120
during surgery,Dr. Shepherd removed a piece of your skull,

688
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:47,020
is now only covered by dura mater.

689
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,440
It's virtually exposed.

690
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:52,610
If somehow that area were to be damaged,

691
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:54,700
it would cause intracranial bleeding,

692
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:58,120
which would cause your brain to swell worse than it did today,x

693
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:01,200
which would cause your brain to swell worse than it did today,which would result in brain death.

694
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,770
So as your doctor,

695
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:07,010
I need you to be very careful not to damage it.

696
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,880
Do you understand what I'm saying?

697
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:22,300
Dr. Grey...

698
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,830
are you doing this

699
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:27,570
for the kid

700
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:29,300
or for me?

701
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,370
Because the snap judgments,

702
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:33,780
the ones that come to us quickly and easily,

703
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,800
without hesitation...

704
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,240
whatever helps you sleep at night.

705
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,620
They're the ones that haunt us forever.
