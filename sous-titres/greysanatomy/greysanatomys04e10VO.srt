00:00:01,174 --> 00:00:03,033
<i>Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy...

2
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:05,702
This is Mary Daltry. She lost
consciousness behind the wheel.

3
00:00:05,822 --> 00:00:07,047
How's Shane, my partner?

4
00:00:07,167 --> 00:00:10,002
I just didn't want her to see.
I thought she might take offense.

5
00:00:10,122 --> 00:00:12,376
- Can you get my wife?
- Baby?

6
00:00:12,548 --> 00:00:14,851
- You're gonna drill into my skull?
- You're kidding me,

7
00:00:14,971 --> 00:00:18,055
- the navigational system is dead?
- Damn it, Stan. Stan.

8
00:00:19,407 --> 00:00:21,135
Can I watch the surgery?
Can I...

9
00:00:21,295 --> 00:00:23,097
- Can you sneak me in?
- You're busted.

10
00:00:23,266 --> 00:00:26,216
I'm going to tell him.
I don't want him seeing other people.

11
00:00:26,611 --> 00:00:27,634
What?

12
00:00:27,836 --> 00:00:30,184
Nothing.
I'm... gonna be late.

13
00:00:30,353 --> 00:00:31,414
We need to talk.

14
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:34,087
My wife gets panicky if she
doesn't know what's going on.

15
00:00:34,207 --> 00:00:36,358
- I will keep her updated.
- You seeing anyone?

16
00:00:51,984 --> 00:00:53,300
<i>At the end of the day,</i>

17
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,554
<i>the experience
of practicing medicine</i>

18
00:00:55,674 --> 00:00:58,134
<i>bears little resemblance
to the dream.</i>

19
00:01:02,977 --> 00:01:04,883
Are you...
Are you really okay?

20
00:01:05,061 --> 00:01:06,121
Yeah.

21
00:01:07,258 --> 00:01:09,102
Alex, come on.
That was intense...

22
00:01:09,222 --> 00:01:11,438
Intense and crazy
and just awful.

23
00:01:12,847 --> 00:01:14,823
How can you be okay
after a day like that?

24
00:01:15,471 --> 00:01:18,363
<i>We go into medicine
because we want to save lives.</i>

25
00:01:18,842 --> 00:01:20,326
You did a good job today,

26
00:01:20,908 --> 00:01:22,147
and it was not easy.

27
00:01:22,461 --> 00:01:24,649
What you did was not easy.

28
00:01:24,933 --> 00:01:26,059
It was brave.

29
00:01:26,558 --> 00:01:29,046
<i>We go into medicine
because we want to do good.</i>

30
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,846
<i>We go into medicine
for the rush, for the high,</i>

31
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:38,288
<i>for the ride.</i>

32
00:01:39,081 --> 00:01:41,818
<i>But what we remember
at the end of most days</i>

33
00:01:42,043 --> 00:01:43,198
<i>are the losses.</i>

34
00:01:44,484 --> 00:01:46,916
<i>What we lie awake
at night replaying</i>

35
00:01:47,075 --> 00:01:48,568
<i>is the pain we caused...</i>

36
00:01:51,395 --> 00:01:53,123
<i>The ills we couldn't cure...</i>

37
00:01:53,575 --> 00:01:55,481
I don't want you
to date other people.

38
00:01:56,017 --> 00:01:58,740
It may not be enough for you,
but I'm trying here.

39
00:01:59,228 --> 00:02:01,350
I don't want you to date
anybody but me.

40
00:02:03,031 --> 00:02:04,487
<i>The lives we ruined...</i>

41
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:07,651
<i>or failed to save.</i>

42
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,968
<i>At the end of the day,
the reality</i>

43
00:02:14,137 --> 00:02:15,742
<i>is nothing like we hope.</i>

44
00:02:17,515 --> 00:02:18,517
<i>The reality is,</i>

45
00:02:18,637 --> 00:02:21,437
<i>at the end of the day,
more often than not,</i>

46
00:02:21,557 --> 00:02:24,162
<i>turned inside out
and upside down.</i>

47
00:02:25,517 --> 00:02:26,550
Over here!

48
00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:28,011
Meredith, get in there.

49
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:29,560
We don't have time to lose.

50
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,973
I got the shirt open.
I'm almost there.

51
00:02:33,157 --> 00:02:34,190
Stop!

52
00:02:34,377 --> 00:02:36,698
Stop! Stop!
Just hold still!

53
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,406
Okay, that's it. I got it.
It stopped. I got it.

54
00:02:41,683 --> 00:02:42,701
Holy crap.

55
00:02:43,237 --> 00:02:44,401
My artery blew.

56
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:47,485
- Your artery blew.
- I didn't think it would really happen.

57
00:02:47,605 --> 00:02:50,414
I thought it was something
that the doctors say might happen

58
00:02:50,555 --> 00:02:53,219
because they have to, I didn't think
that it would really happen.

59
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,437
Me neither.

60
00:03:01,008 --> 00:03:02,524
Their local tech's in Spokane.

61
00:03:02,768 --> 00:03:05,652
That's 5 hours away. Did you tell 'em
I was in the middle of somebody's brain?

62
00:03:05,772 --> 00:03:07,930
Yes. The tech is still in Spokane.

63
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:11,913
You can't just pull the probes out
and go to a full craniotomy?

64
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:13,990
No. Why not?

65
00:03:14,347 --> 00:03:15,971
Uh, the probe is in the tumors.

66
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,133
Pulling out without
the navigation system

67
00:03:18,253 --> 00:03:19,643
could damage the brain tissue.

68
00:03:19,765 --> 00:03:22,142
You can't leave the probe in very long
without risking swelling.

69
00:03:22,262 --> 00:03:23,975
- That's good. What's your name?
- Two.

70
00:03:24,106 --> 00:03:25,691
Steve. Steve Mostow.

71
00:03:25,926 --> 00:03:27,900
Dr. Steve Mostow, intern.

72
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,992
Steve, I need you to run
to the nurses' station.

73
00:03:30,123 --> 00:03:32,709
Tell them to make an announcement.
We need computer technicians

74
00:03:32,836 --> 00:03:34,960
in OR 3. Go fast and scrub in
on your way back.

75
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,653
- Yes, sir.
- Dr. Shepherd.

76
00:03:36,773 --> 00:03:38,467
- Yes.
- I did three semesters

77
00:03:38,587 --> 00:03:40,846
in computer science
before I switched to nursing.

78
00:03:40,966 --> 00:03:43,038
I don't know what's wrong,

79
00:03:43,158 --> 00:03:45,966
but if it's something
reasonably basic, I...

80
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:48,755
I'd feel a lot better about this
if your voice wasn't shaking.

81
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:51,086
My voice shakes when I'm nervous.
I'm an imperfect person,

82
00:03:51,206 --> 00:03:53,029
but it doesn't mean
I can't fix the computer.

83
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:55,180
Rose has three semesters
of computer science at...

84
00:03:55,321 --> 00:03:57,011
- What school d'you go to?
- Santa Cruz.

85
00:03:57,152 --> 00:03:59,375
- That's a party school.
- You want to insult my education,

86
00:03:59,495 --> 00:04:01,379
or do you want me to try
and save your patient?

87
00:04:01,499 --> 00:04:04,237
Who can beat three semesters
of computer science at Santa Cruz?

88
00:04:04,873 --> 00:04:05,878
Anybody?

89
00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:10,094
Okay, give it a shot.

90
00:04:10,285 --> 00:04:12,088
I appreciate
the vote of confidence.

91
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,793
Can you see anything yet?

92
00:04:16,347 --> 00:04:18,555
Uh, I see the diaphragm moving.

93
00:04:18,781 --> 00:04:20,124
Move it up a little more.

94
00:04:21,175 --> 00:04:22,912
- Meredith.
- I'm working on it.

95
00:04:23,156 --> 00:04:25,964
You're not doing
a very good job.

96
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:29,667
I am doing a damn fine job.
Don't you worry.

97
00:04:31,874 --> 00:04:32,938
Can you...

98
00:04:33,058 --> 00:04:35,269
- Can you close his eyes?
- What?

99
00:04:35,898 --> 00:04:36,921
Stan...

100
00:04:37,566 --> 00:04:39,519
Can you...
Can you close his eyes?

101
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,683
I'm sorry... so sorry.

102
00:04:47,767 --> 00:04:49,063
Meredith, uh, stop.

103
00:04:49,243 --> 00:04:51,449
Stop right there.
I want to freeze that frame.

104
00:04:51,646 --> 00:04:53,618
Yeah,
his pericardium's full of blood.

105
00:04:53,932 --> 00:04:55,835
That's not good.
That's not good at all.

106
00:04:55,955 --> 00:04:58,523
Oxygen, IV start kits.
Arnie, monitor.

107
00:04:59,297 --> 00:05:00,955
You, pericardiocentesis kit.

108
00:05:01,466 --> 00:05:03,466
His anatomy's all screwed up

109
00:05:03,644 --> 00:05:05,043
from hanging upside down.

110
00:05:05,226 --> 00:05:06,846
Get someone from cardio. Go.

111
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:12,925
I got Tucker waiting for me in
the lobby, and I'm already late.

112
00:05:13,045 --> 00:05:15,478
Do me a favor and take the patient
through the post-op.

113
00:05:16,606 --> 00:05:17,611
What?

114
00:05:18,331 --> 00:05:21,374
Okay, I wanted to say that when you
took me off of Hahn's service today...

115
00:05:21,494 --> 00:05:24,577
There's something wrong with him.
His blood pressure's bottomed out.

116
00:05:26,512 --> 00:05:27,864
- Dr. Bailey?
- O'Malley...

117
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:31,574
Okay, I need you
to talk to Tucker.

118
00:05:31,694 --> 00:05:33,537
I need you to ask him to wait.

119
00:05:33,706 --> 00:05:36,593
He's not going to be inclined to wait,
so I need you to ask him nicely.

120
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:40,018
Can you please go
and ask him nicely to wait?

121
00:05:40,243 --> 00:05:41,736
- Yes, ma'am.
- I won't be long.

122
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:43,915
You see this, Stevens?

123
00:05:44,035 --> 00:05:45,173
Sternum's cleaned out,

124
00:05:45,293 --> 00:05:46,864
which means
we're almost outta here.

125
00:05:46,984 --> 00:05:48,982
You don't want to stay
and watch me work?

126
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:51,476
You know,
it's offensive, Dr. Sloan, flat-out.

127
00:05:51,608 --> 00:05:53,369
I asked you if you wanted
to watch me work.

128
00:05:53,491 --> 00:05:55,587
- How's that offensive?
- And now you play dumb?

129
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,731
Does that work for you
because of the way you look?

130
00:05:57,851 --> 00:05:59,906
- What the hell are you talking about?
- I'm saying,

131
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:03,150
if you were homely, you would've
lost your job a long time ago.

132
00:06:04,353 --> 00:06:06,451
Dr. Hahn, the chief needs you
in the ambulance bay.

133
00:06:06,573 --> 00:06:08,667
We have a paramedic
with cardiac tamponade.

134
00:06:08,824 --> 00:06:10,692
All righty, then.
Let's go, Stevens.

135
00:06:14,812 --> 00:06:15,976
Nick, can, uh...

136
00:06:16,614 --> 00:06:18,577
- Can you reach your call button?
- I think so.

137
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,382
No, no.
Don't move that much.

138
00:06:24,542 --> 00:06:25,546
Just...

139
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:28,057
Can... Can you reach
your phone...

140
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:31,256
- without moving very much?
- I think so. I think so.

141
00:06:32,242 --> 00:06:33,663
- I got it.
- Okay, good, good.

142
00:06:33,783 --> 00:06:35,298
Okay, dial...

143
00:06:35,921 --> 00:06:36,922
Dial 8.

144
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,390
Okay. Okay.

145
00:06:38,696 --> 00:06:40,058
Is that... Is that 8?

146
00:06:41,723 --> 00:06:43,103
Put it to my ear, okay?

147
00:06:44,183 --> 00:06:45,538
<i>Hello, nurses' station.</i>

148
00:06:45,658 --> 00:06:48,484
Hi, uh, this is Dr. Grey.
Um, yeah.

149
00:06:48,663 --> 00:06:50,851
Mr. Hanscomb's carotid just blew.

150
00:06:51,025 --> 00:06:53,599
Uh, can you page
Dr. Sloan for me, please?

151
00:06:53,719 --> 00:06:55,537
And also Dr. Yang? And...

152
00:06:55,657 --> 00:06:58,108
I'm gonna go ahead
and call this a code blue.

153
00:06:58,296 --> 00:07:00,618
Yes, code blue.
Can you announce that, please?

154
00:07:00,738 --> 00:07:02,072
- <i>Right away.</i>
- Thank you.

155
00:07:02,457 --> 00:07:04,032
- You can put it down.
- Code blue.

156
00:07:04,152 --> 00:07:05,491
That means I'm dead, right?

157
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:08,662
That's what they call
when people go, like, flatline?

158
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,131
I figure we can use
all the help we can get.

159
00:07:23,445 --> 00:07:26,130
I don't care who it is.
I don't care who it is, Jolene,

160
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,512
I am leaving this hospital
when I am finished here.

161
00:07:28,632 --> 00:07:31,411
I don't care if the patient is on fire.
I'm not scrubbing in anywhere else.

162
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,877
It's Dr. Yang's. Lexie Grey
is paging you 9-1-1.

163
00:07:33,997 --> 00:07:35,780
Dr. Yang,
your intern called a code blue

164
00:07:35,951 --> 00:07:37,791
on a patient
who apparently is not code blue.

165
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:40,175
- What do you mean?
- Why would she call a code if...

166
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,305
Go find out.

167
00:07:41,426 --> 00:07:43,624
I thought you needed me here.
You said you needed me here,

168
00:07:43,746 --> 00:07:45,823
- that's why you pulled me off cardio.
- No, I'm fine.

169
00:07:45,943 --> 00:07:47,267
Go kick some intern butt.

170
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:51,775
How you doing, Dr. Grey?

171
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:54,259
Lexie.
I'm okay. You okay?

172
00:07:55,146 --> 00:07:57,334
Well, I'm a little freaked out
if I'm being honest.

173
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,910
Mostly 'cause you look like
Carrie at the prom.

174
00:08:00,172 --> 00:08:02,051
Seriously, you're wearing,
like, half my blood.

175
00:08:02,171 --> 00:08:04,052
Which is why we're hanging
some more right now.

176
00:08:04,174 --> 00:08:06,150
- I'm having trouble getting a vein.
- Why?

177
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,392
He's hypovolemic.
His veins are flaccid.

178
00:08:08,577 --> 00:08:10,032
That's not a nice thing to say.

179
00:08:10,154 --> 00:08:12,103
That... That's not a nice thing
to say at all.

180
00:08:13,276 --> 00:08:15,144
- Oh, son of a bitch!
- Okay!

181
00:08:15,332 --> 00:08:16,853
Grey, stop that bleeding.

182
00:08:17,037 --> 00:08:18,502
- Stop the bleeding.
- I...

183
00:08:18,971 --> 00:08:20,402
My hand slipped.

184
00:08:20,577 --> 00:08:22,975
- I got it.
- That can't happen anymore.

185
00:08:23,204 --> 00:08:24,778
That can't happen anymore, okay?

186
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,510
Just apply steady, firm pressure.

187
00:08:26,679 --> 00:08:29,406
I called for Sloan.
Should we just take him to an OR?

188
00:08:29,526 --> 00:08:31,481
No, there's no OR.
I was just down there.

189
00:08:34,312 --> 00:08:36,303
Tyler, you should run
and get some more blood.

190
00:08:36,425 --> 00:08:38,283
- Just in case, OK?
- Keep applying pressure.

191
00:08:38,403 --> 00:08:40,316
- I'm gonna go get Sloan.
- You're leaving?

192
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,794
I'll be right back.
You can do this. You're doing this.

193
00:08:46,222 --> 00:08:47,509
Are you seeing this, Karev?

194
00:08:47,856 --> 00:08:49,828
How I'm tightening
the cable by hand?

195
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,316
Yeah.

196
00:08:54,273 --> 00:08:55,316
That's my face.

197
00:08:55,457 --> 00:08:56,978
- What?
- Up there in the gallery,

198
00:08:57,098 --> 00:08:58,980
I built that face.
That's Jane Doe.

199
00:08:59,257 --> 00:09:00,445
The one with amnesia.

200
00:09:00,852 --> 00:09:02,899
- Is she a surgeon?
- I don't, uh...

201
00:09:03,087 --> 00:09:05,152
You are...
You are so busted.

202
00:09:05,334 --> 00:09:07,296
Dr. Sloan, it's Nick Hanscomb.
His carotid blew.

203
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,219
Karev, I need you to irrigate thoroughly
finish up and pack the wound.

204
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:12,106
- You're leaving?
- Can survive without me.

205
00:09:12,226 --> 00:09:14,141
- My other guy can't.
- There's no OR available.

206
00:09:14,261 --> 00:09:16,775
This one will be. I need you to get
this room turned around ASAP.

207
00:09:16,895 --> 00:09:18,561
I'm bringing down
my carotid bleed.

208
00:09:21,713 --> 00:09:22,802
Tucker.

209
00:09:25,255 --> 00:09:27,032
She's busy, right?
She can't make lunch?

210
00:09:27,152 --> 00:09:29,723
She can. She can make lunch.
Just a slightly later lunch.

211
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,354
- She's in surgery.
- Always is.

212
00:09:31,474 --> 00:09:34,235
- It's taking a little longer than...
- Always does.

213
00:09:35,295 --> 00:09:36,902
She's having a really bad day.

214
00:09:37,022 --> 00:09:40,027
She's saving the life
of a white supremacist.

215
00:09:40,358 --> 00:09:41,522
This is not a good day.

216
00:09:41,661 --> 00:09:43,596
So she asked me to ask you
if you wouldn't mind

217
00:09:43,718 --> 00:09:45,511
just waiting just a little
while longer.

218
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,463
Please. She did say please,

219
00:09:49,292 --> 00:09:52,578
which, as you may know, is not
a word she uses that frequently, so...

220
00:09:53,715 --> 00:09:54,790
She really is sorry.

221
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,386
This shouldn't be much longer.

222
00:09:56,535 --> 00:09:59,733
Fine. But tell Miranda I said
don't keep me waiting long.

223
00:10:00,513 --> 00:10:01,564
Please.

224
00:10:05,561 --> 00:10:06,585
Lucy.

225
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,170
If it's all right with you, I'd like
to update Mr. Nolston's family

226
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,211
and meet you
in the ambulance bay.

227
00:10:19,436 --> 00:10:22,086
He's your patient. Don't you want me
to keep the family informed?

228
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:25,251
I want you to think like a surgeon.
You're thinking like a social worker,

229
00:10:25,371 --> 00:10:28,331
and if you want to be a social worker,
you can save yourself a lot of effort,

230
00:10:28,451 --> 00:10:30,479
because the training
is 2 years, not 12.

231
00:10:30,686 --> 00:10:32,124
But if you want to be a surgeon,

232
00:10:32,244 --> 00:10:35,023
you can update the family
when the crisis has passed.

233
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,789
You're right. Absolutely.
I'm sorry. I...

234
00:10:45,988 --> 00:10:47,890
- Yes, sir?
- Did you bring anybody with you?

235
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:50,322
Uh, no.
The nurses made an announcement,

236
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:52,186
and I waited, but no one came.

237
00:10:53,068 --> 00:10:55,533
Damn. Damn it, damn it, damn it.

238
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,331
I don't have the steadiest hand.
I need to reconnect some wires,

239
00:10:58,451 --> 00:11:00,873
when you talk to me,
it is less steady.

240
00:11:01,068 --> 00:11:03,818
- So it's about the wires?
- I think so. I'm pretty sure.

241
00:11:04,045 --> 00:11:05,510
- All right. I'll do it.
- What?

242
00:11:05,641 --> 00:11:07,841
I'll do it. You said yourself
you don't have steady hands.

243
00:11:07,961 --> 00:11:09,711
- Because I'm nervous.
- Yeah, I got that.

244
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:12,713
Let me take care of the wires.
I'm a neurosurgeon, I have steady hands.

245
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,912
You're holding the leads
in the patient's brain.

246
00:11:15,401 --> 00:11:16,631
Okay. Steve,

247
00:11:17,214 --> 00:11:19,289
- How's your hand? Is it steady?
- Uh, yes, sir.

248
00:11:19,486 --> 00:11:21,413
Good. It better be
or you'll kill my patient.

249
00:11:21,533 --> 00:11:23,610
- Hold this very, very still.
- Yes, sir.

250
00:11:24,136 --> 00:11:26,295
Very very still. Good.

251
00:11:29,442 --> 00:11:31,031
Sterile sleeves, gloves, plea.

252
00:11:31,151 --> 00:11:32,804
Tell me what I've got to do.

253
00:11:35,935 --> 00:11:37,105
You talked to Tucker?

254
00:11:37,225 --> 00:11:39,584
Yes. He says as long
as you're out soon, he'll wait.

255
00:11:39,704 --> 00:11:42,855
Oh, mother of...
The hepatic vein was injured.

256
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,483
- Can you check for a new murmur?
- Yeah, checking now.

257
00:11:45,603 --> 00:11:47,699
O'Malley, I need you
to go talk to Tucker.

258
00:11:47,819 --> 00:11:51,517
- Just ask him to wait a little longer.
- But I just scrubbed in.

259
00:11:51,714 --> 00:11:53,577
- O'Malley, ask him.
- Yes, ma'am.

260
00:12:06,646 --> 00:12:09,829
A person can only rise so high.

261
00:12:10,441 --> 00:12:12,293
Now I'm rising above,

262
00:12:12,413 --> 00:12:14,523
but there's a ceiling,
and I'm about to hit it.

263
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:17,490
Let me guess.
Air embolus?

264
00:12:22,871 --> 00:12:25,688
We're about to start
the pericardiocentesis.

265
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:27,291
But with the position of his body,

266
00:12:27,411 --> 00:12:29,571
the blood won't be pooled
to the base of the heart, so...

267
00:12:29,693 --> 00:12:32,639
I'd still use the subxiphoid
rather than the parasternal.

268
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:33,810
Right. Okay.

269
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:37,344
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah. Is the kit ready yet?

270
00:12:37,464 --> 00:12:39,553
Yeah, I'm getting it
ready for you now.

271
00:12:41,395 --> 00:12:42,607
How you doing, Ray?

272
00:12:42,851 --> 00:12:45,301
Grey, you've got to be careful
with this technique.

273
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,834
If you aim the needle incorrectly,
you could nick

274
00:12:47,954 --> 00:12:50,994
- the very-thin-walled right atrium.
- Which could cause a cardiac rupture.

275
00:12:51,114 --> 00:12:53,102
A cardiac rupture,
a tension pneumothorax...

276
00:12:53,222 --> 00:12:55,668
Basically there's about
6 different ways she could kill him.

277
00:12:56,366 --> 00:12:57,925
Are they talking about me?

278
00:12:58,197 --> 00:12:59,686
No, don't listen to them, Ray.

279
00:13:01,892 --> 00:13:03,098
Shut up.

280
00:13:07,547 --> 00:13:09,303
Sir, you're gonna be fine.

281
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,948
Stevens,
go get me an 18 gauge needle

282
00:13:13,068 --> 00:13:14,975
before this man's heart
explodes in his chest.

283
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:16,166
Got it.

284
00:13:23,214 --> 00:13:24,434
How you're doing, Karev?

285
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,925
Yeah, good, I'm fine.

286
00:13:26,498 --> 00:13:29,049
My nose itches.
It itches like crazy.

287
00:13:29,169 --> 00:13:30,414
Yeah, that's the anxiety.

288
00:13:30,555 --> 00:13:32,490
You know you can't scratch it,
so it itches.

289
00:13:35,195 --> 00:13:37,485
- What did you do?
- Nothing. I was irrigating.

290
00:13:37,605 --> 00:13:39,444
I need more suction.
Let's get some exposure.

291
00:13:39,564 --> 00:13:41,057
It's coming from inside his chest.

292
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,397
I think his heart's starting to bleed.

293
00:13:43,851 --> 00:13:44,956
Hang a unit of blood.

294
00:13:45,076 --> 00:13:46,851
- Page Hahn and Sloan, now!
- Right away!

295
00:13:52,309 --> 00:13:54,178
Tyler, could you get me
more gauze, please?

296
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:56,518
Why do you need more gauze?

297
00:13:56,638 --> 00:13:58,434
Because I'm bleeding?
I'm still bleeding?

298
00:13:58,554 --> 00:14:00,605
Well, we have blood
going in, too, Nick.

299
00:14:01,004 --> 00:14:02,920
Is it going in as fast
as it's going out?

300
00:14:03,294 --> 00:14:05,021
I'm asking because
I'm starting to feel,

301
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:07,032
like, queasy... And...

302
00:14:07,308 --> 00:14:08,703
weak, maybe like a...

303
00:14:08,904 --> 00:14:10,622
A person who's losing
a lot of blood.

304
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,943
Okay, I'm transferring now, Nick.
You ready?

305
00:14:18,819 --> 00:14:20,397
Should I be calling people?

306
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:22,528
Should I be calling
my family or somebody?

307
00:14:22,943 --> 00:14:25,976
I think... I think
the bleeding stopped.

308
00:14:26,802 --> 00:14:28,111
How you doing, Nick?

309
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:30,121
Oh, Dr. Sloan. It's Dr. Sloan.

310
00:14:30,241 --> 00:14:32,060
- I think the bleeding stopped.
- You okay?

311
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,805
Do I... do I look okay?

312
00:14:34,443 --> 00:14:36,502
Actually, you do.

313
00:14:36,622 --> 00:14:38,913
Dr. Grey, looks like you got
the bleeding under control.

314
00:14:39,072 --> 00:14:41,298
- Why would it stop?
- It could have been the herald bleed,

315
00:14:41,418 --> 00:14:43,801
which means, there's a possibility
of it bleeding again.

316
00:14:43,923 --> 00:14:46,325
But it won't, 'cause I'm gonna
get it closed up before it does.

317
00:14:46,445 --> 00:14:48,402
- There's no OR.
- There will be in ten minutes.

318
00:14:48,522 --> 00:14:50,509
Dr. Grey, get a pressure
dressing on this wound.

319
00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:53,099
Dr. Yang, get him prepped for transfer,
and straight to OR 3.

320
00:14:53,219 --> 00:14:55,363
I'm gonna make sure it's cleared out.
You did good work.

321
00:14:55,485 --> 00:14:56,499
Thank you.

322
00:15:00,577 --> 00:15:01,929
I'm in love with you now.

323
00:15:02,267 --> 00:15:04,230
I've forgotten entirely
about my ex.

324
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:12,196
Come on. Are you kidding me?

325
00:15:12,316 --> 00:15:14,373
- What?
- I have a patient on the table who's...

326
00:15:14,493 --> 00:15:15,735
- I gotta go.
- Erica...

327
00:15:15,855 --> 00:15:17,327
Stevens,
page the cardio fellow,

328
00:15:17,447 --> 00:15:20,188
then book an OR. Have it
waiting when they get him free.

329
00:15:30,945 --> 00:15:33,332
- Why am I not surprised?
- Dr. Bailey is very sorry.

330
00:15:33,452 --> 00:15:34,712
She's very, very sorry.

331
00:15:34,843 --> 00:15:36,775
- I'm outta here.
- She just asked me to ask you

332
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:38,732
if you could wait just
a little while longer.

333
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,741
She's almost done with
the surgery. It took...

334
00:15:40,863 --> 00:15:42,544
It's more complicated
than she expected,

335
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:43,968
but she is almost done.

336
00:15:45,053 --> 00:15:47,588
Fine, I'll wait.
But you tell her I am tired,

337
00:15:47,983 --> 00:15:50,323
tired of her choosing everything
over me and our marriage.

338
00:15:50,443 --> 00:15:52,392
You tell her this is
the last time. I'm finished.

339
00:15:52,514 --> 00:15:55,566
You tell her the only reason I'm staying
here is to tell her that myself.

340
00:15:56,966 --> 00:15:58,409
What the hell did you do, Karev?

341
00:15:58,529 --> 00:16:00,358
Nothing. Uh, I cut the cable.
The bleeding...

342
00:16:00,478 --> 00:16:02,727
You cut the cable? You were
showing off for your girlfriend?

343
00:16:02,849 --> 00:16:04,560
Do you have any idea
how screwed you are?

344
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,185
Not his fault. One heart graft's blew.
Holding his left coronary with a clamp.

345
00:16:08,308 --> 00:16:09,922
- Somebody paged Hahn?
- I'm here.

346
00:16:10,045 --> 00:16:11,735
- What happened?
- His heart graft blew.

347
00:16:11,857 --> 00:16:13,163
- Damn it.
- If you need...

348
00:16:13,283 --> 00:16:16,187
All I need you to do, Karev, is to stay
quiet and get more suction in here.

349
00:16:16,307 --> 00:16:17,612
Just hold on to that.

350
00:16:27,783 --> 00:16:29,379
Your husband is waiting.

351
00:16:29,651 --> 00:16:30,656
Good.

352
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:32,723
He's waiting and...

353
00:16:32,843 --> 00:16:34,630
I heard you.
Why aren't you scrubbed in?

354
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,876
I could use a hand.

355
00:16:36,402 --> 00:16:39,238
He said something
about you choosing...

356
00:16:39,641 --> 00:16:42,115
Everything over your marriage.

357
00:16:43,408 --> 00:16:44,500
He said that?

358
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:47,235
What else did he say?

359
00:16:47,355 --> 00:16:48,606
I think that was about it.

360
00:16:48,726 --> 00:16:50,012
You think or you know?

361
00:16:51,987 --> 00:16:55,020
He said that this was the last time
and that he was finished.

362
00:16:57,453 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm in surgery, O'Malley.

363
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,825
Did you tell him that I'm trying
to save a man's life here?

364
00:17:03,473 --> 00:17:06,550
That I want to be there
with him right now,

365
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:09,396
but if I were to leave, he would die,
did you tell him that?

366
00:17:09,516 --> 00:17:10,577
Yeah, yes.

367
00:17:10,741 --> 00:17:12,884
You need to go back out there
and tell him

368
00:17:13,004 --> 00:17:14,406
that I took a vow...

369
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:17,474
A vow to save lives.
And he might want to remember

370
00:17:17,594 --> 00:17:20,195
that he also took a vow...
For better or for worse.

371
00:17:20,381 --> 00:17:23,837
You tell him that
it's his job as a husband

372
00:17:23,957 --> 00:17:25,384
to understand that.

373
00:17:25,543 --> 00:17:27,584
You tell him that
I'm standing by my vow,

374
00:17:27,704 --> 00:17:28,948
for better or for worse.

375
00:17:29,076 --> 00:17:30,887
You tell him
I'm holding him to his vow.

376
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:34,289
You tell him if he's thinking
about leaving right now,

377
00:17:34,472 --> 00:17:37,244
that he might find himself
hurt and wounded

378
00:17:37,364 --> 00:17:38,753
and needing an operation,

379
00:17:39,264 --> 00:17:40,768
and he may not get a surgeon

380
00:17:40,888 --> 00:17:42,618
who is as married
to her vows as I am.

381
00:17:42,738 --> 00:17:43,790
You tell him that.

382
00:17:47,452 --> 00:17:49,190
- Can't I just do some charts?
- Go.

383
00:17:58,094 --> 00:17:59,831
- It's in.
- It's in?

384
00:18:00,009 --> 00:18:01,024
Wire's in.

385
00:18:04,234 --> 00:18:05,499
Steve, are you still?

386
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:06,863
Yes, sir. Very still.

387
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,708
Stop looking at me
like I killed your patient.

388
00:18:12,828 --> 00:18:15,395
I am not a computer technician.
I did my best. I gave it a shot.

389
00:18:15,515 --> 00:18:17,208
- Didn't do your best.
- I did my best.

390
00:18:17,328 --> 00:18:18,552
It was my best, damn it.

391
00:18:18,672 --> 00:18:20,400
Calm down.
Take a deep breath and think.

392
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:21,993
What did you miss?

393
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,420
What are you forgetting?

394
00:18:31,548 --> 00:18:32,937
You forgot the restart button?

395
00:18:33,547 --> 00:18:35,295
I forgot to press the restart button.

396
00:18:36,497 --> 00:18:38,093
It's working. It's working.

397
00:18:38,272 --> 00:18:39,277
It's working.

398
00:18:39,449 --> 00:18:40,472
It's working.

399
00:18:41,327 --> 00:18:43,336
Santa Cruz is not just a party school.

400
00:18:43,654 --> 00:18:45,222
- Dr. Shepherd...
- Yes.

401
00:18:46,049 --> 00:18:47,054
Sleeves.

402
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,069
This was never my plan, to...

403
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,173
To die this way.

404
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,722
- You're not dying, Nick.
- You're going to the OR.

405
00:18:58,842 --> 00:18:59,945
No, I know.

406
00:19:00,435 --> 00:19:02,003
That's what I'm saying.
I mean,

407
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,132
I think we kind of have some say,

408
00:19:04,752 --> 00:19:06,198
or at least a feeling.

409
00:19:07,175 --> 00:19:09,804
But I never had that feeling,
so...

410
00:19:10,414 --> 00:19:11,832
I can't die, right?

411
00:19:16,318 --> 00:19:17,661
I don't feel good.

412
00:19:18,497 --> 00:19:19,567
I feel...

413
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:23,637
- Nick, can you squeeze my hand?
- My God. What happened?

414
00:19:23,757 --> 00:19:26,021
The blood to the right side
of his brain... He had a stroke.

415
00:19:26,141 --> 00:19:27,474
Looks like he had a stroke.

416
00:19:27,596 --> 00:19:29,803
Let's go. Let's move him carefully.
Let's go.

417
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:33,441
You can't cry, Lexie.

418
00:19:33,637 --> 00:19:35,355
This isn't over. You can't cry.

419
00:19:43,095 --> 00:19:46,131
You need to find the xiphoid process.
Can you feel it?

420
00:19:47,542 --> 00:19:48,587
- Got it.
- Okay.

421
00:19:48,746 --> 00:19:51,638
Now go two finger breadths
to the left of the xiphoid.

422
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:53,661
I'm there.

423
00:19:54,386 --> 00:19:55,391
Here.

424
00:19:58,497 --> 00:19:59,597
18 gauge.

425
00:20:00,845 --> 00:20:02,348
That is a very big needle.

426
00:20:02,505 --> 00:20:05,565
- I know. I'm sorry.
- You're going to angle the needle

427
00:20:05,685 --> 00:20:07,306
toward the left shoulder.
Don't stab.

428
00:20:07,428 --> 00:20:09,938
You don't wanna hit the ventricle,
and you don't wanna drop the lung.

429
00:20:10,098 --> 00:20:12,520
- That wouldn't help matters either.
- I changed my mind.

430
00:20:12,675 --> 00:20:15,145
- I want out.
- This is gonna help you, Ray.

431
00:20:15,334 --> 00:20:16,951
I'm gonna go on three, okay?

432
00:20:17,194 --> 00:20:18,199
One...

433
00:20:18,556 --> 00:20:19,922
- two...
- Wait.

434
00:20:20,254 --> 00:20:22,066
Tell Stan's wife I'm sorry.

435
00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:24,790
Tell Sara I'm sorry about Stan.

436
00:20:25,709 --> 00:20:26,903
Tell her yourself.

437
00:20:27,421 --> 00:20:30,154
- One, two...
- Wait. Wait.

438
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:32,556
We're running out of time.

439
00:20:32,676 --> 00:20:34,028
Just wait a minute.

440
00:20:34,187 --> 00:20:36,358
- What's taking so long?
- He's not ready.

441
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:39,269
I'm trying not to be scared.

442
00:20:39,445 --> 00:20:41,989
I don't wanna die scared.
I wanna not be scared.

443
00:20:42,109 --> 00:20:43,574
Ray, listen to me.

444
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:46,863
It's good to be scared.

445
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,859
It means you still have
something to lose.

446
00:20:54,726 --> 00:20:55,796
Are you scared?

447
00:20:58,149 --> 00:20:59,275
All the time.

448
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,960
That's good.

449
00:21:05,917 --> 00:21:07,635
Okay. I'm ready.

450
00:21:08,195 --> 00:21:09,581
But... don't count.

451
00:21:09,772 --> 00:21:11,678
Just do it.
Just do it so I don't know it's...

452
00:21:17,384 --> 00:21:18,972
The infection went to his heart.

453
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,498
His hack of a surgeon
didn't check the grafts.

454
00:21:21,773 --> 00:21:23,046
I should've caught it.

455
00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:25,957
I should've checked. I missed it.
Damn it. How did I miss it?

456
00:21:26,116 --> 00:21:28,081
Stupid. Stupid.

457
00:21:28,201 --> 00:21:30,557
- That's fascinating, Dr. Hahn.
- What?

458
00:21:30,932 --> 00:21:33,227
You're as unkind to yourself
as you are to everyone else.

459
00:21:36,813 --> 00:21:38,447
Dr. Sloan, his artery blew again,

460
00:21:38,638 --> 00:21:40,595
and he appears to be having
a left-sided CVA.

461
00:21:40,715 --> 00:21:42,968
- Where is he?
- Here. You told me to bring him here.

462
00:21:45,653 --> 00:21:47,123
Hahn, are you close?

463
00:21:48,785 --> 00:21:50,345
Get him to a sterile procedure room.

464
00:21:50,465 --> 00:21:51,604
- Run!
- Let's go.

465
00:21:51,724 --> 00:21:54,730
- I'm done. What do you want me to do?
- I need an anesthesiologist,

466
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:56,559
- a nurse, I need equipment.
- I'm on it.

467
00:21:56,679 --> 00:21:58,116
Karev, stay with Hahn.

468
00:22:02,158 --> 00:22:04,205
This man has four children.

469
00:22:04,374 --> 00:22:06,496
He has four children.

470
00:22:11,066 --> 00:22:14,043
- I feel like I'm going in too far.
- Pull back, pull back.

471
00:22:14,828 --> 00:22:17,213
- Pull back, pull back.
- Chief, what am I doing?

472
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:20,051
You're too far in.
There's some ST elevation.

473
00:22:20,183 --> 00:22:21,742
Try angling more forward.

474
00:22:25,118 --> 00:22:27,203
I got it. I got it.

475
00:22:31,587 --> 00:22:32,648
That feels good.

476
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:34,603
I can breathe.

477
00:22:34,723 --> 00:22:37,138
Okay, he's almost stable.
Get ready to cut him out.

478
00:22:39,113 --> 00:22:41,134
All right.
We're gonna get you outta here.

479
00:22:41,254 --> 00:22:42,925
We're getting you outta here right now.

480
00:22:45,707 --> 00:22:46,753
You're bleeding.

481
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:49,310
- That's Ray's blood.
- Let me see that.

482
00:22:55,411 --> 00:22:57,242
You could use
a couple of stitches.

483
00:22:58,115 --> 00:22:59,477
Now you stayed calm

484
00:22:59,871 --> 00:23:00,969
and focused

485
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:04,144
and efficient
in a very stressful situation.

486
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:06,186
That's impressive.

487
00:23:07,612 --> 00:23:08,762
I was scared.

488
00:23:09,619 --> 00:23:10,873
You did it anyway.

489
00:23:11,578 --> 00:23:12,667
Like I said...

490
00:23:13,074 --> 00:23:14,163
Impressive.

491
00:23:21,913 --> 00:23:23,959
Do not tell me
that there isn't an OR available.

492
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:27,140
This is for the Chief of surgery.
There's a paramedic's life on the line.

493
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:29,818
- You need to find one now.
- I'll see where we are.

494
00:23:30,137 --> 00:23:32,447
Dr. Stevens. Thank God.
How is he?

495
00:23:35,095 --> 00:23:37,509
I believe he's still in surgery,
but I don't know.

496
00:23:38,156 --> 00:23:39,790
You don't know?
Why... don't you...

497
00:23:40,256 --> 00:23:42,134
You said you were gonna
keep me informed and...

498
00:23:42,275 --> 00:23:43,298
I know. I'm sorry.

499
00:23:43,418 --> 00:23:45,507
I'm on another case.
But I was gonna check back...

500
00:23:45,627 --> 00:23:46,959
You're on another case?

501
00:23:47,591 --> 00:23:48,729
I'm sorry.

502
00:23:49,024 --> 00:23:51,977
I have four kids here.
I have four terrified children

503
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,132
who think that their dad's gonna
die any minute.

504
00:23:54,522 --> 00:23:57,083
You had lousy instructors who didn't
teach you how to be a good doctor,

505
00:23:57,203 --> 00:23:58,354
or really bad parents

506
00:23:58,474 --> 00:24:00,836
who didn't teach you
how to be a decent human being?

507
00:24:02,057 --> 00:24:03,998
Stevens,
OR two is clearing out now.

508
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,131
Thank you.

509
00:24:05,251 --> 00:24:07,510
My husband is Jacob Nolston,

510
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:09,199
and he went
into surgery hours ago.

511
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:11,172
Could you please find someone
who can tell me

512
00:24:11,294 --> 00:24:12,712
whether he is dead or alive?

513
00:24:14,429 --> 00:24:15,435
She said that?

514
00:24:15,555 --> 00:24:17,172
If you could wait a few minutes,

515
00:24:17,292 --> 00:24:19,320
you guys could talk
to each other because,

516
00:24:19,492 --> 00:24:21,425
you know, things get lost
in translation,

517
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:23,290
because this is
clearly not a way to have

518
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:25,676
what is obviously a very,
very important conversation.

519
00:24:25,796 --> 00:24:28,144
It is clearly not very important.

520
00:24:28,539 --> 00:24:31,131
Our marriage is falling apart,
and she sends you to save it.

521
00:24:31,582 --> 00:24:32,615
Tucker...

522
00:24:34,377 --> 00:24:35,783
She's in surgery.

523
00:24:36,488 --> 00:24:38,627
She's saving a life.
She's literally saving a life,

524
00:24:38,747 --> 00:24:41,232
- she's gonna be here soon.
- She's always saving a person's life.

525
00:24:41,352 --> 00:24:42,808
She'll always be here soon.

526
00:24:43,254 --> 00:24:44,289
You go ask her,

527
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:46,148
when exactly is "soon"

528
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,435
gonna come?

529
00:24:59,734 --> 00:25:01,180
Excuse me.
You're...

530
00:25:02,046 --> 00:25:03,680
You're the one who came to get me,

531
00:25:04,589 --> 00:25:06,016
who told me about Stan?

532
00:25:08,542 --> 00:25:09,665
Is Ray...

533
00:25:09,785 --> 00:25:11,043
He's in surgery.

534
00:25:14,321 --> 00:25:15,798
I have to go. I have to get...

535
00:25:15,918 --> 00:25:17,432
I have to get outta here, so...

536
00:25:19,379 --> 00:25:21,394
Look, can you tell him that...

537
00:25:22,906 --> 00:25:24,962
That I'm sorry that I...
That I can't stay here?

538
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,850
But I can't
come back here right now.

539
00:25:27,339 --> 00:25:30,393
Ray wanted me to tell you
that he's sorry, too.

540
00:25:30,513 --> 00:25:32,391
He's sorry he couldn't save Stan.

541
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:35,903
He wanted me to tell you that
in case he didn't make it.

542
00:25:38,654 --> 00:25:40,140
You think he's not gonna make it?

543
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:41,570
I hope he makes it.

544
00:25:42,611 --> 00:25:44,317
But you won't be here, so...

545
00:25:47,152 --> 00:25:48,362
My husband is dead.

546
00:25:50,453 --> 00:25:51,506
He's dead...

547
00:25:52,236 --> 00:25:53,709
Somewhere in this hospital.

548
00:25:55,517 --> 00:25:57,921
How am I supposed to...
To stay here?

549
00:26:00,711 --> 00:26:01,766
I don't know.

550
00:26:03,026 --> 00:26:04,205
I don't know.

551
00:26:05,032 --> 00:26:06,344
But I know that if Ray...

552
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,642
makes it,
he's gonna wake up, and...

553
00:26:09,055 --> 00:26:10,503
he's gonna have no one.

554
00:26:11,325 --> 00:26:12,746
And you're gonna go home,

555
00:26:13,192 --> 00:26:14,458
and you're gonna have...

556
00:26:15,086 --> 00:26:16,102
no one.

557
00:26:16,971 --> 00:26:18,884
I think it's better
to have someone.

558
00:26:19,706 --> 00:26:20,855
Even if it hurts,

559
00:26:20,978 --> 00:26:23,659
even if it's the most painful
thing you have to do,

560
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,565
even if it's the most painful thing
you've ever had to do,

561
00:26:28,274 --> 00:26:29,973
I think it's better
to have someone.

562
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,783
See this skin, O'Malley?

563
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:35,948
It looks a little...

564
00:26:36,347 --> 00:26:37,436
jagged.

565
00:26:37,874 --> 00:26:39,395
Does it look jagged to you?

566
00:26:40,201 --> 00:26:42,248
'Cause if it is jagged,

567
00:26:42,781 --> 00:26:45,581
I'm going to have
to reposition the incision

568
00:26:45,701 --> 00:26:48,011
so that it approximates
more correctly.

569
00:26:48,171 --> 00:26:49,410
If I do that,

570
00:26:49,664 --> 00:26:52,143
this man's swastika tattoo

571
00:26:52,584 --> 00:26:55,114
might be unrecognizable.

572
00:26:57,974 --> 00:26:59,373
Yeah, it's a little jagged.

573
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,394
I thought so, too.

574
00:27:04,935 --> 00:27:06,100
He left, right?

575
00:27:07,027 --> 00:27:08,239
Yes, he left.

576
00:27:10,778 --> 00:27:11,877
10-blade.

577
00:27:14,654 --> 00:27:16,081
More lap pads, Stevens.

578
00:27:17,095 --> 00:27:18,898
Pack them all around the heart.

579
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:25,682
Suction.

580
00:27:28,673 --> 00:27:30,500
Come on, Ray.
Fight.

581
00:27:34,043 --> 00:27:35,357
You will not die.

582
00:27:35,603 --> 00:27:37,059
You will not die.

583
00:27:37,712 --> 00:27:38,923
You will not die...

584
00:27:50,429 --> 00:27:51,706
Don't do this, Mary.

585
00:27:52,299 --> 00:27:53,623
Come on. Don't do this.

586
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:55,992
I need more light.
Can I get more light?

587
00:27:58,266 --> 00:27:59,524
Come on. Come on.

588
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:01,656
- He's coding.
- Come on.

589
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:04,231
Live.
Please live. Please.

590
00:28:06,201 --> 00:28:07,346
Please live.

591
00:28:22,916 --> 00:28:24,156
He looks bad.

592
00:28:25,364 --> 00:28:26,528
He looks really bad.

593
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,729
Well, his heart was severely damaged

594
00:28:29,178 --> 00:28:30,877
and his lungs were compromised.

595
00:28:31,138 --> 00:28:32,405
But he's young and strong,

596
00:28:32,541 --> 00:28:34,607
and our hope is
that he'll be just fine.

597
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:00,777
I'm here.

598
00:29:12,856 --> 00:29:15,196
Well, your liver had more damage
than we saw on the CT,

599
00:29:15,316 --> 00:29:17,937
and then we found
a perforation in your bowel.

600
00:29:18,057 --> 00:29:20,695
But we took care of it all,
and you should have a full recovery.

601
00:29:21,841 --> 00:29:23,402
Not a full recovery.

602
00:29:25,259 --> 00:29:26,352
Dr. Bai...

603
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:28,667
She did this on purpose, right?

604
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:30,925
I don't understand.

605
00:29:31,354 --> 00:29:32,816
You have a black partner, right?

606
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,844
Mary?

607
00:29:36,694 --> 00:29:37,930
Do you know how she is?

608
00:29:38,198 --> 00:29:39,529
Are you two friends?

609
00:29:41,022 --> 00:29:42,956
Look, I'm not the devil, okay?

610
00:29:44,138 --> 00:29:46,053
I'm just a guy
with a belief system.

611
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,511
Mary's a nice girl.
We save lives together.

612
00:29:50,631 --> 00:29:51,753
That's a good time.

613
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,544
Now if she wanted
to marry my brother,

614
00:29:53,664 --> 00:29:56,390
I'd have a problem with that,
but so would a lot of people.

615
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:00,398
I'm not that much different
than most of the people that you know.

616
00:30:03,628 --> 00:30:06,108
Well, Dr. Bailey did
save your life today.

617
00:30:06,951 --> 00:30:09,777
A black woman saved your life
at great personal cost.

618
00:30:10,015 --> 00:30:12,359
So maybe next time
you're looking at your tattoo,

619
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:15,357
you're thinking how much better all us
white guys are than everyone else,

620
00:30:15,477 --> 00:30:16,587
you think about that.

621
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:18,464
Because between you and me,

622
00:30:18,875 --> 00:30:22,049
if I had been alone in that OR,
you'd probably be dead right now.

623
00:30:23,044 --> 00:30:25,354
And since we're sharing belief systems,

624
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:27,498
I believe, if you were dead,

625
00:30:27,676 --> 00:30:29,601
the world would be a better place.

626
00:30:41,428 --> 00:30:42,512
How's he doing?

627
00:30:43,347 --> 00:30:45,704
He's okay.
The surgery was pretty hairy.

628
00:30:46,022 --> 00:30:47,867
He blew a graft
when we were closing.

629
00:30:48,071 --> 00:30:49,555
But he's starting to rally.

630
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:51,082
Good. That's good.

631
00:30:53,385 --> 00:30:54,631
What are you doing here?

632
00:30:54,772 --> 00:30:57,298
- I was just checking...
- We did just fine without your help.

633
00:30:57,822 --> 00:30:58,902
You mind?

634
00:31:17,131 --> 00:31:18,413
You're not heading home?

635
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,405
Just easier at this point
to stay here

636
00:31:22,525 --> 00:31:23,914
till Tucker's asleep.

637
00:31:26,769 --> 00:31:29,276
You know,
I rose above, too, today.

638
00:31:29,838 --> 00:31:32,088
- Yes, you did.
- You were having a hard day,

639
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:33,870
you were busy rising above,

640
00:31:34,674 --> 00:31:35,806
but so was I,

641
00:31:36,241 --> 00:31:38,157
which is why
I haven't said anything.

642
00:31:38,373 --> 00:31:41,094
But now the day is over,
and I'm done.

643
00:31:41,698 --> 00:31:43,379
- Excuse me?
- You know, what you did,

644
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:46,374
pulling me off of Hahn's surgery,
was an abuse of power.

645
00:31:46,963 --> 00:31:49,433
- What are you...
- You know, you need help? Okay.

646
00:31:49,746 --> 00:31:52,281
But you used me
because of the color of my skin.

647
00:31:52,505 --> 00:31:55,181
I mean, you compromised
the quality of my education

648
00:31:55,382 --> 00:31:56,655
because of my color.

649
00:31:58,313 --> 00:31:59,435
I resent it.

650
00:32:13,702 --> 00:32:14,895
You saved her life.

651
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,245
No, I fixed her brain,

652
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,450
restored her motor skills,
did a highly stressful,

653
00:32:18,572 --> 00:32:20,459
extremely difficult procedure.
But, no...

654
00:32:20,669 --> 00:32:22,312
You saved her life.

655
00:32:54,576 --> 00:32:55,877
Thanks. That was...

656
00:32:59,542 --> 00:33:00,700
Your voice is shaking.

657
00:33:00,975 --> 00:33:02,431
I'm an imperfect person.

658
00:33:19,921 --> 00:33:21,290
Are his parents coming?

659
00:33:21,756 --> 00:33:23,869
They're on a plane from California.

660
00:33:24,047 --> 00:33:25,155
You gonna wait?

661
00:33:26,177 --> 00:33:27,510
Yeah, I'm gonna wait.

662
00:33:48,548 --> 00:33:50,246
I don't want you
to date other people.

663
00:33:51,266 --> 00:33:53,689
It may not be enough for you,
but I'm trying here.

664
00:33:53,876 --> 00:33:55,979
So I don't want you to date
anybody but me.

665
00:33:57,046 --> 00:33:58,127
That's it.

666
00:34:02,228 --> 00:34:03,307
Except...

667
00:34:04,514 --> 00:34:06,394
I'm scared as hell to want you.

668
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,290
But here I am,
wanting you anyway.

669
00:34:10,266 --> 00:34:13,069
And fear means I have
something to lose, right?

670
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:15,352
And I don't want to lose you.

671
00:34:21,446 --> 00:34:23,305
Don't. Don't say anything.

672
00:34:24,612 --> 00:34:25,743
I'm gonna leave,

673
00:34:26,238 --> 00:34:27,999
and you can say something tomorrow.

674
00:34:28,931 --> 00:34:30,286
That's progress, right?

675
00:34:45,963 --> 00:34:48,226
Are you...
Are you really okay?

676
00:34:51,367 --> 00:34:52,571
Alex, come on.

677
00:34:52,691 --> 00:34:54,128
That was intense...

678
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:56,575
Intense and crazy
and just awful.

679
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,914
How can you be okay
after a day like that?

680
00:35:04,044 --> 00:35:05,633
Why won't you talk to me?

681
00:35:06,532 --> 00:35:08,712
What do you want me
to talk about, Rebecca?

682
00:35:09,194 --> 00:35:10,941
How a guy almost bled out
while I watched,

683
00:35:11,063 --> 00:35:13,289
or how I got suspended
for a week 'cause you were there?

684
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:16,073
- It's Ava, not Rebecca.
- Right.

685
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:17,902
You're playing dress up.

686
00:35:18,058 --> 00:35:19,727
You're here playing dress up.

687
00:35:20,402 --> 00:35:22,749
You have a husband, Rebecca.
You have a baby,

688
00:35:22,937 --> 00:35:24,039
and I have a life.

689
00:35:24,365 --> 00:35:25,937
That girl you were talking to earlier

690
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:28,184
when you were playing
med student? I'm screwing her.

691
00:35:28,465 --> 00:35:31,378
She might be a bigger wreck than I am,
but at least she's not married,

692
00:35:31,531 --> 00:35:33,375
at least she's not gonna
get me suspended,

693
00:35:33,495 --> 00:35:36,031
at least she's not trying to pretend
to be somebody she's not.

694
00:35:36,532 --> 00:35:38,795
You gotta ask yourself
what you're doing here.

695
00:35:39,009 --> 00:35:40,785
'cause I think
if you could get honest,

696
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:43,403
if you could just tell
the damn truth for one minute,

697
00:35:43,655 --> 00:35:45,815
I think you have to admit
you're not here to talk.

698
00:36:14,275 --> 00:36:15,664
You did a good job today,

699
00:36:16,353 --> 00:36:17,618
and it was not easy.

700
00:36:17,905 --> 00:36:20,131
What you did was not easy.

701
00:36:20,383 --> 00:36:21,562
It was brave.

702
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:26,122
We killed him.

703
00:36:28,838 --> 00:36:29,873
The hospital...

704
00:36:33,201 --> 00:36:34,224
Sloan...

705
00:36:34,365 --> 00:36:35,426
Us...

706
00:36:37,703 --> 00:36:39,206
We were not prepared.

707
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,733
That happens sometimes.

708
00:36:49,529 --> 00:36:50,553
That's...

709
00:36:53,262 --> 00:36:55,745
Do you have any idea
how backwards that is?

710
00:36:57,748 --> 00:36:59,221
We help more than we hurt.

711
00:37:07,488 --> 00:37:08,605
I have no one.

712
00:37:36,126 --> 00:37:37,833
This is gonna sound bizarre.

713
00:37:39,319 --> 00:37:40,878
I realize at this point

714
00:37:40,998 --> 00:37:42,990
that this is
gonna sound bizarre, but...

715
00:37:44,597 --> 00:37:47,175
Any chance you people
want to get a drink with me?

716
00:37:48,552 --> 00:37:50,168
Why would we want to do that?

717
00:37:50,299 --> 00:37:52,064
She's saying she needs a friend.

718
00:37:53,374 --> 00:37:54,643
Okay. Fine. Let's drink.

719
00:37:54,763 --> 00:37:56,643
- You won't hit on me?
- I can't promise that.

720
00:37:56,763 --> 00:37:59,495
- If I say please?
- He still can't promise that.

721
00:38:04,061 --> 00:38:05,122
Fine.

722
00:38:18,798 --> 00:38:19,934
I brought supplies.

723
00:38:33,304 --> 00:38:35,895
<i>Some days, the whole world
seems upside down.</i>

724
00:38:36,684 --> 00:38:37,942
She's got no one.

725
00:38:54,028 --> 00:38:55,141
I'm drinking.

726
00:38:56,399 --> 00:38:57,770
Are you drinking, Lexie?

727
00:39:00,624 --> 00:39:01,920
A drink would be good.

728
00:39:21,601 --> 00:39:23,348
I was Hahn's right hand today.

729
00:39:26,811 --> 00:39:28,454
That's good, right?
That's great.

730
00:39:32,109 --> 00:39:33,649
I think a patient feels better

731
00:39:34,053 --> 00:39:36,062
if they know
their kids aren't terrified.

732
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,538
They're more likely
to pull through surgery

733
00:39:38,658 --> 00:39:40,364
if they know
their wives aren't panicked.

734
00:39:40,484 --> 00:39:42,907
- I think those things matter.
- Well, they do matter.

735
00:39:44,618 --> 00:39:46,245
I'm never gonna be Cristina.

736
00:39:48,095 --> 00:39:50,662
It's just not gonna happen.
And I am never gonna be Erica Hahn.

737
00:39:50,782 --> 00:39:51,933
I am not...

738
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:54,004
kick-ass.

739
00:39:55,971 --> 00:39:57,240
Thank God for that.

740
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:09,246
I love you.

741
00:40:11,988 --> 00:40:13,062
I love you.

742
00:40:17,671 --> 00:40:19,756
We're not gonna
make this work, are we?

743
00:40:23,989 --> 00:40:26,290
Marriage is hard.
I mean, even when it's right...

744
00:40:27,626 --> 00:40:28,724
It's hard...

745
00:40:30,569 --> 00:40:31,611
and...

746
00:40:34,286 --> 00:40:36,845
Next time I do it,
I just want it to be forever.

747
00:40:40,393 --> 00:40:41,472
And I don't...

748
00:40:41,887 --> 00:40:43,906
I don't think it's our chemistry.

749
00:40:46,612 --> 00:40:47,889
I think it's our timing.

750
00:40:50,497 --> 00:40:52,516
But I don't think it's our chemistry.

751
00:40:55,259 --> 00:40:57,494
So we're saying maybe someday?

752
00:41:04,498 --> 00:41:06,066
We're saying maybe someday.

753
00:41:34,877 --> 00:41:36,079
Come on, Izzie.

754
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,539
Dance party.

755
00:41:40,626 --> 00:41:41,818
You want to dance?

756
00:41:45,456 --> 00:41:47,363
I will if you want me to.

757
00:41:47,978 --> 00:41:49,245
<i>And then somehow,</i>

758
00:41:49,593 --> 00:41:50,776
<i>improbably</i>

759
00:41:51,067 --> 00:41:53,001
<i>and when you least expect it,</i>

760
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:55,525
<i>the world rights itself again.</i>
