1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:06,040
if you're a normal person,one of the few
things you can count on in life is death.

2
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:13,820
-hello.
-these are amazing.

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,540
They're--they're all
about the medicine.

4
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,180
I mean,there's,like,no personal crap,no
talk about boyfriends or feelings.

5
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:20,710
She hardly even mentions you.

6
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,260
Yes,thank you for pointing that out.

7
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,410
What about when she held the
retractor for six hours without moving?

8
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:26,990
But if you're a surgeon...

9
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,050
even that comfort is
taken away from you.

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,230
They're like the har
potter books I never had.

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,740
Hey,did you read the part when she did the
pyloric stenosis on the 3-week-old baby?

12
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,950
Surgeons cheat death.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,290
We prolong it,we deny it.

14
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,630
Hold on. He's in v-fib.

15
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:50,860
Charge to 300.

16
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,130
clear.

17
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,890
Up to 360. Clear.

18
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,680
We stand and defiantly
give death the finger.

19
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,220
He's good. Let's go.

20
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,040
hey,you're late.

21
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,310
She has skills lab.

22
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,650
Good morning,cristina.
It feels like minutes.

23
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,450
-See you later?

24
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,700
-No,no,tucker.I did not say i
won't do the marriage counseling.

25
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,490
I'm saying I can't do
it in the mornings again.

26
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,270
I'm now 20 minutes late for work.

27
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,670
O-okay. I'll see you tonight.

28
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,520
Marriage counseling--
how's that going?

29
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:27,200
you just heard us arguing about the marriage
counseling. How do you think it's going?

30
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,050
no. You're doing a craniotomy on
my patient rosemary bullard today.

31
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,490
Now are you gonna be awake for that,or
will you be yawning into her brain?

32
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,270
Meredith kept me up most of the night.

33
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,470
I don't want to hear about your dirty,nasty--
talking on the phone with cristina.

34
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,400
And they stole your sleep?

35
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,700
Did you say yang goes or I go?

36
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:43,520
I don't think I'd win that one.

37
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,270
those two come as a set.
You should know that by now.

38
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,480
-Before she had burke. Burke helped.
-True.

39
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:50,390
I think counseling's a good move.

40
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,850
Addison and I did counseling.

41
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,580
Right before you got divorced!

42
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,230
Ladies and gentlemen,allow
me to introduce...

43
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,970
stan.

44
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,750
A state-of-the-art,computerized
patient simulator.

45
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:09,370
Stan can educate you in airway
management,trauma assessment and care.

46
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:16,050
He breathes,he pulsates,he seizes,he
hemorrhages,he secretes and he speaks.

47
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,310
Hello,stan.

48
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,540
Hello,doctor. I'm not feeling well.

49
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,290
stan will tell you what he needs,and
he's more forgiving than most patients.

50
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,000
You kill him,he'll keep
coming back for more.

51
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,090
So make good use of him,people.

52
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,500
We're operating on robots now?

53
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,050
-Can we please go back to pigs?
-Yeah,what about people?

54
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,890
Uh,when the chief decides which one of you gets to
do the first solo surgery, you'll want to be ready.

55
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,470
wait,did you just say solo surgery?

56
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,870
I do not know what it will be.
I do not know when it will be.

57
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:49,590
I do know that the winner should be
prepared to do any surgical procedure

58
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,380
and will choose one intern to scrub in.

59
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:57,810
So practice your skills,impress your
attendings and just do not make me look stupid.

60
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,180
Uh,grey,stevens,you're
with hahn. Yang,the pit.

61
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,490
Karev and o'malley,you're skills lab
today,so you can take turns getting to know-

62
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,650
- dibs!Mine!

63
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,550
I am having chest pain.

64
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,140
So just to be clear,we are not
cracking open any chests today?

65
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,410
No,stevens.

66
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,150
It's just that with the
solo surgery coming up,

67
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:18,330
we were kinda hoping to be
on a cool surgical something--

68
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,060
right,I'm gonna stop you right there.

69
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,800
Listen,I don't get attached to
patients,but I like this guy.

70
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:26,830
And I have spent almost two years giving
his family hope and then taking it away.

71
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:30,850
This procedure can buy him time until
he can get another shot at a transplant.

72
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,650
So we need to make sure it works,okay?

73
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,090
-Absolutely.
-Of course.

74
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,820
You've familiarized
yourself with the case?

75
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,740
Yeah,michael norris-- 44-year-old male
with congenital hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

76
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,620
who has failed medical
treatment at seattle pres.

77
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,840
He's been waiting on a heart transplant since narrowly
missing out on one on may 14th of two thousand--

78
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,020
wait,wait.

79
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,240
-What?
-May 14th what?

80
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,940
What?

81
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,840
That'S... that's denny's heart.

82
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,590
That's theeart I stole for denny.

86
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,980
I need you to have
sex with cristina yang.

87
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:13,550
Good morning.

88
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,750
Distract her. Engage her.

89
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,980
Give her something to do after midnight
besides call my girlfriend and wake me up.

90
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:20,670
Yang? No.

91
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,730
No,too serious,humorless,un-fun--
not my type.

92
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,150
Yang should be youtype.

93
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:28,510
She's intense,intelligent,complicated.

94
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,850
She's like a single malt scotch,and
you're used to beer bongs.

95
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,990
Callie torres is no beer bong.

96
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,980
Oh,you know,wait a minute. I get it.

97
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,180
You don't think you have a shot.

98
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,880
You're probably right.

99
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:41,960
Oh,I have a shot.

100
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:45,690
-Then try it,as a favor.
-No.I'm not your stud horse.

101
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,470
You can't just--just tell me who
to sleep-- you slept with my wife.

102
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,460
yeah,I'll give it a shot.

103
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,940
***okay,good.

104
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,510
Are you guys shooting drugs? Oh,my god.

105
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,600
No. We're practicing I.V.S.

106
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,760
How else are we supposed to learn?

107
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:11,990
Yang never lets us do anything.

108
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,510
So you're practicing on each other.

109
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,220
We did it at baylor. It's cool.

110
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,670
No,it's not cool. It's crazy.

111
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,110
It's,like,creepy-basement crazy.

112
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,920
D-don't tell anyone.

113
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,960
Don't worry. She won't tell.

114
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,710
ah,Dr. Hunt. Got a second?

115
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,170
It's about to get a little
loud in here,sir,but shoot.

116
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:37,140
Uh,listen,we're getting ready to award the
first solo surgery to a second-year resident.

117
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,730
I want your take.

118
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:43,260
Uh-- unidentified male,mid-30s,lost vitals
in the field,shocked him back into sinus tach.

119
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,990
Possible fractures in
both arms,unstable pelvis.

120
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,650
okay,on three. Two,three.

121
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,730
Good,go.

122
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,910
Open right tib/fib,rigid abdomen.

123
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,450
-What doesn't this guy have?
-Found him under a freeway overpass.

124
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,930
Cops think someone threw him over.

125
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,350
After they beat him half to death?

126
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,710
So it's a contest,the solo surgery?

127
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,950
You have fresh eyes. You
don't know them personally.

128
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,790
You don't have any
history,any relationship.

129
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,110
That perspective is rare here.

130
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,150
I'll give it some thought.

131
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,590
Oh,Dr. Webber,I was just
wondering,uh,regarding the solo surgery,

132
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,660
I presume it's gonna
be a,um,general surgery?

133
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,060
I just wanted to be prepared.

134
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,580
You'll know when you all know.

135
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:19,260
And one more thing,if my E.R. Reports are
right,you've been working for three days straight.

136
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,940
When do you sleep?

137
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,370
You keep tabs on all your
attendings,or just the new guys?

138
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,140
-his I.V. Blew.
-Yang,he needs that access now.

139
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,860
Yes,I'm doing it,sir.

140
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,870
This will buy him some time
until you get that line in.

141
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:35,700
if you were less worried about winning
contests,you might have thought of it.

142
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:45,740
So you're... gonna give me
a-a heart attack,literally?

143
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,150
Uh,it's a technique
called alcohol ablation,

144
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,570
uh,through a catheter
in your femoral artery.

145
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,280
Dr. Hahn will inject ethanol
straight into youreart.

146
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:59,100
The alcohol will incinerate
any tissue cells it touches.

147
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,170
Dr. Stevens?

148
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,380
w-we're gonna be burning away the
muscle in your ventricle that's,

149
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,970
um,blocking your ability to get oxygen.

150
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,930
If we're successful,you should
feel immediate relief,so...

151
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:17,690
just like that,I'll...
be able to breathe?

152
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,810
just like that.

153
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,640
-And--and he can't be asleep during
the procedure? -I'm afraid not.

154
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:27,200
Dr. Stevens here will be asking
you to cough,inhale and exhale.

155
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,790
And checking to see if I'm dead yet?

156
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,570
mike,stop.

157
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,080
I mean,it...

158
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,100
it is a heart attack,right?

159
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:39,510
It's a dangerous procedure,but it's
one that we can monitor and control.

160
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:43,190
And if you don't have it,thnext
heart attack you have--

161
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:47,920
-and you will have
one-- will kill me.

162
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:51,000
Promise you'll keep me awake?

163
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,840
I don't want to miss this.

164
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:01,440
I want mike's latest echo and angio
before he goes to the cath lab.

165
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,960
-Are you freaking out?
-What?

166
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,420
Why? Do you think I should be?

167
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:11,320
This patient... in denny's old room?
It's a lot of denny for one day,iz.

168
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,340
It is a lot.

169
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,850
A lot.

170
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,790
Is it a lot of denny for you,too?

171
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,100
I mean,how much denny
are you experiencing?

172
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,350
Iz,you can do this.

173
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,750
My pain is getting worse.

174
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,310
-My pain is getting worse.
-I hate this.

175
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:34,050
I'm not gonna win the solo
surgery practicing on plastic man.

176
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,770
You're not gonna win the
solo surgery because you suck.

177
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,690
Your bedside manner is what sucks.

178
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,590
what? What did you say?

179
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,990
-Ain't technology amazing?
-Screw is.

180
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,510
I'm gonna practice medicine. You
go ahead and play with your doll.

181
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:51,110
What's the matter,scared
of a little education?

182
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,740
You are so awesome
you are so-- no!

183
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,800
No! Stan!

184
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,970
what does a guy have to do
to get a beating this bad?

185
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,780
maybe he'll tell us when he wakes up.

186
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,770
Well,let's hope he makes it that long.

187
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,960
Uh,three,run these to the lab,and then go by the
morgue and get the forms for an unclaimed body.

188
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,230
He's gonna need a chest tube,right?

189
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,460
'Cause I was just hoping--with
the solo surgery coming up--

190
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,290
with the solo surgery coming
up,your job is to impress me. So gO.

191
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:24,830
Dr. Yang,with the solo surgery
coming up,your job is to impress me.

192
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,400
You are planning for this m's death
while I am fighting for his life.

193
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:28,950
I was trying to be prepared. I'm sorry.

194
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,000
I can't use sorry. I could use a doctor.

195
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,050
Be one.

196
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:38,230
The kind of metastases you have
are prone to spontaneous bleeding.

197
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:41,830
So there are considerable
risks to the surgery.

198
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:44,920
-Are you saying this one might be dicier?
-Might be a little dicier?

199
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,420
Much dicier than previous surgeries.

200
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,910
I want to be clear. You can live with
this tumor for months if not longer.

201
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,260
Not--not
like this.

202
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,500
Not feeling this bad.

203
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,680
I understand that risks
are part of the package.

204
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,620
That's why you people make me go
cross-eyed signing all these forMs.

205
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,270
you're signing a "do
not resuscitate" order?

206
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,610
If it's my
time to go--

207
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:11,080
she doesn't want to be on a
life support kind of thing.

208
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,060
-She'd hate that.
-I'd just hate lying around like that.

209
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,620
-I don't want that.
-Okay.

210
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,250
-Good-bye,darling.
-Good-bye,love.

211
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:39,950
Oh,sorry.

212
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,420
We... we do this every time.

213
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:49,940
she signs the paper,we kiss good-bye,and
then after the surgery,we say hello again.

214
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,730
Well,that sounds like a plan to me.

215
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,230
You rest up. We'll be
bringing you up soon.

216
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:56,990
okay.

217
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,610
That there is the
holy grail of marriage.

218
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,760
Something to aspire to.

219
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:04,140
What happens to them?

220
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,470
You sign,the attending
signs,pink copy goes in his charT.

221
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:11,450
No,I-I-I mean the bodies,the--the
unclaimed bodies. What happens to them?

222
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,930
Well,if they remain unclaimed for a certain amount of time,
they're cremated--the ones that haven't been preserved.

223
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:16,770
Preserved?

224
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:21,050
For medical research-- gross
anatomy,surgical study-- that sort of thing.

225
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,420
-For,like,med students?
-Exactly.For med stu-students.

226
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,060
To practice on?

227
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,560
You're pretty.

228
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,710
thank you all for being here.

229
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:46,120
I appreciate the opportunity to
learn,and I'm sorry you had to die.

230
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,610
Oh,uh,uh,instrument trays.

231
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:50,760
hold compressions. We got a rhythm.

232
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:53,670
We've got to get him up to surgery.
He's bleeding through his leg splint.

233
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,990
So the chief asked me to watch the
second years for the solo surgery.

234
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:58,700
What's your take,as a class?

235
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:01,230
They're a mixed bag. Yang's very good.

236
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:05,320
She's,uh,hard-core.
She'll be a cardio god.

237
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,420
-She's my roommate,actually.
-And stevens?

238
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:11,340
She's smart,good with patients,very
compassionate... supposedly.

239
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,060
She did sleep with my ex-husband
while we were still married.

240
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:16,960
You know what? I'm more
interested in the doctor part.

241
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,650
Right.Yeah. Obviously. Of course.

242
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,230
new scans. Good.

243
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:26,340
There's a splenic
subcapsular hematoma--

244
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,660
I can look.Go update his chart.

245
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,300
Dr. Yang,you paged me?

246
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,060
Uh,yeah,patient,trauma one.

247
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:42,140
Aw,you paged me for a consult? I
was hoping you wanted to see me.

248
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:46,320
I did. Uh,uh,the patient has a shattered nose
and cheekbones and a fractured left mandible.

249
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,960
Trauma one.

250
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,140
Okay,mike,the catheters
are in. It's time to inject.

251
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,220
Okay,just hold tight.
Stevens,over here,please.

252
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,920
I specifically chose you for this case
because you connect well with patients.

253
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:09,200
yeah,that's actually something
I've been told to work on not doing.

254
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,950
Mike needs you talking to him.

255
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:14,080
He's scared,his pulse
is elevating. Step up.

256
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,250
okay. Oh,yeah.

257
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,130
hey,mike.

258
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,590
U're doing great.

259
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,080
you're gonna feel a
little bit of burning.

260
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,360
Well,then
we get--oh!

261
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,620
Oh,there it is. Oh,god.

262
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,840
Try not to move.

263
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:37,070
Um,try--try to lay
still,mike,and try to breathe.

264
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:39,920
make it stop. Make it stop.

265
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,230
Mike,we can't stop,but it's gonna
end soon,so just hang in there.

266
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,760
-Stevens,talk to
him. -I'm--I'm sorry.

267
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,550
-Okay,grey,how is his pressure?
-85 systolic.

268
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:51,970
-Open up his I.V
-stens,talk to him!Help him!

269
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:56,120
stevens,get him to
cough,get him to breathe.

270
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,580
-Stevens!
-pressure's stabilizing.

271
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,800
okay,how you doin',mike?

272
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,610
I still... can't breathe.

273
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,680
does that mean we're not successful?

274
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,690
mike,there were two arterial
routes I could choose.

275
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,900
The next time we
do this,I think--

276
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:19,320
no,I can'T.I won't do this again.

277
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:22,740
Please,I can't-- I
can't do this again.

278
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:26,860
I'm sorrY. I'm so sorry.

279
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:36,420
Tell stevens to find me so I can
permanently throw her off my service.

280
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,810
Dr. Hahn,I know you have a
history with this patient,

281
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:41,310
but in a weird way,izzie does,too.

282
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,960
A history,with my patient?

283
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:47,010
No,with denny duquette.

284
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,600
Tell her to find me.

285
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:55,980
the tumor's position has been altered.

286
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,990
I need an ultrasound localization.

287
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,660
Took care of my yang problem,by the way.

288
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:02,940
Already?

289
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,900
that sounds too easy.

290
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:08,930
If it doesn't feel like
work,it's not going to work.

291
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:11,230
Where'd you learn
that,hmm,marriage counseling?

292
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,770
of course not. It's a
complete wastof time.

293
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:19,300
This couple,the bullards,I
bet they never got counseling.

294
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:22,320
They just take their bad with the good.

295
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,750
damn it. The tumor's hemorrhaging.

296
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:25,860
Her brain's starting to swell.

297
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,500
Push 70 of the mannitol.

298
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:30,310
She's bradying down. Uh,1 of atropine.

299
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:34,650
Let's make sure these two get
a chance to say hello again.

300
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,050
-have you seen izzie?
-no

301
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:45,970
You got anything I can scrub
in on? Robo patient sucks.

302
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,850
-Listen,izzie is having a rough day,so if you
see her, -don't-- no,no,no,I'm having a rough day.

303
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,420
What happened?

304
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,070
Hunt. Hunt hates me. I mean,he hates me.

305
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:54,990
He kissed you.

306
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:59,540
S,uh,that was,I don't
know,before. Now he hates my guts.

307
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:00,650
This is worse than hahn.

308
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:04,340
I mean,I-I have no idea what
I did or--or said or what...

309
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,150
I gotta get off this case.

310
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,950
Dr. Yang...

311
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:14,330
our guy is scheduled for surgery,and I
want to know when I'm gonna see you next.

312
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,600
Uh,he's not stable yet.

313
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,930
Well,then we might have time
to-- uh,I just got paged down.

314
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,420
This does not happen to me.

315
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,520
Bow to me,for I am the
queen of the interns.

316
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:28,880
I have assembled an army of
the dead to teach us things.

317
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,230
Cadavers-- I got us cadavers to
practice on,a whole bunch of 'em.

318
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,660
You got cadavers,human cadavers?

319
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,800
They're down in the tunnels.
We'll meet there for lunch.

320
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,670
Let me ask you something.

321
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,780
Do you know if izzie stevens had some
sort of a relationship with denny duquette?

322
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,370
what,you mean bides the engagement,oh,

323
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:00,400
and the cutting of his l-vad wire so she
could move him up the transplant list?

324
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,250
What,you didn't know about this?

325
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,980
Izzie was on probationary leave.

326
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:07,290
She was,like,nearly
kicked out of the program.

327
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,540
-I forget you weren't here then.
-No,I wasn'T.

328
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:14,850
I was at another hospital watching my
patient's heart get stolen out of his chest.

329
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,770
Did you page me down here for sex?
'Cause I'm not really in the mood.

330
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,030
Want to see some dead guys?

331
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:24,620
-Why?
-Come on.

332
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:26,400
Why would you say that? Why?

333
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:28,700
Cadavers... for practice...

334
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,060
-what?
-For the solo surgery.

335
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,830
What is this?

336
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,590
I ard u were having a crappy day.
I thought this would cheer you up.

337
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:39,980
what?

338
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:45,060
it's like a bouquet of corpses.
That is so,um,I'm sorry.

339
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,840
No. That's crazy. He's dead. He is dead.

340
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,030
Just so many dead people today.

341
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,470
These are for interns.

342
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,560
Go play with the dummy!

343
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,470
ah,come on!

344
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,320
I cannot help it. I'm dying.

345
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,400
But I'm applying pressure.

346
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,450
There must be something
you're forgetting.

347
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,670
Oh,for crying out loud!

348
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:14,130
I'm surprised you even
passed your intern exam.

349
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,430
Oh,my god.

350
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,810
I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.

351
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,760
chief,I have to talk to you.

352
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,140
hey,hahn. Come in. I
want you to watch this.

353
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,620
Let's blow an artery.

354
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,750
I'm bleeding out.

355
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,860
I'm bleeding out.

356
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:40,360
It's about izzie stevens
and denny duquette.

357
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,870
how is stevens still working here?

358
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:48,480
How is seattle grace still accredited?
This whole thing goes unreported?

359
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,820
It's no wonder this place is number 12.
What kind of hospital are you running?

360
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,000
You want to stop right there,erica.

361
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,520
I want an ethics review panel assembled.

362
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,910
I want stevens' role
in this investigated,

363
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,740
and bailey's as well,because
she was her superior.

364
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,150
-Slow down,erica.
-No.

365
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,910
My patient lost a
heart over this,richard!

366
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,330
-Someone is damn well gonna lose their job.
-Stop!

367
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:07,370
We're not digging this up.

368
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,720
It didn't go unreported. It was
reported to me. I dealt with it.

369
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,130
Stevens was punished. She's
learned from her mistake.

370
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,690
And she is on her way to
becoming an excellent surgeon.

371
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,540
That's the kind of hospital I'm running.

372
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,600
Now this issue has been laid to rest.

373
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:22,390
It's in the past,and that's
where it's gonna stay.

374
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,950
It is not in the past for me.

375
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:28,130
It's lying on a bed in
the I.C.U. About to die.

376
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:32,400
Then your only responsibility is
to make sure that doesn't happen.

377
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,800
It was a difficult
surgery,especially at her age.

378
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,970
We're not sure how she's gonna respond.

379
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,150
Oh,sure.

380
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:55,200
The waiting is always the hard part.

381
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,300
Ed,she might not make
it through the night.

382
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,510
I know. I know.

383
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,450
Iz.

384
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,700
You hiding from hahn?

385
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:34,870
sure. Her,too.

386
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,150
Is mike okay?

387
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:40,740
No,the ablation failed. And he's
refusing to try again,so hahn'S...

388
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,380
um,you should go talk to her.

389
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,740
I stole his heart,meredith.

390
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:49,440
I stole it for denny.
I stole it for myself.

391
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,440
And now I'm supposed to hold
his hand while we torture him?

392
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,330
I can't even look at him.

393
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,540
It's my fault that he's here.

394
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:03,300
So anyway... I'm hiding.

395
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:12,010
Yang,suction here,please.

396
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:17,030
Sloan's coming in for the mandibular repair?

397
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:20,200
sorry about before.

398
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:22,850
Everybody's,uh,up in everybody else's business around here,you know?

399
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:25,540
Better to keep things professional if you can.

400
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:26,790
Yes.

401
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,160
'Cause one minute you're working with people,

402
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,210
and then you're friends with them and then you're whatever,

403
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,850
and then suddenly there's all this pressure to define what you are,

404
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,580
like it's all black-and-white.You're either this or you're that.

405
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,640
You are aware that you're doing it again,right?

406
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,870
Dr. Hunt,how's our mystery man?

407
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:44,770
Still with us.He's a fighter.

408
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:46,390
Hate to be the other guy.

409
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,690
Callie.

410
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:51,550
Dr. Yang,I know cracking chests is more your thing,

411
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:55,000
but you'd be surprised how exciting it can be when I manipulate a little skin.

412
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:59,480
Actually,Dr. Yang,why don't you just scrub out?We've got enough hands in here.

413
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,360
Okay.

414
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,340
Oh,hey.I heard he went up.Can I scrub in?

415
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:08,010
Oh,shut it.If i'm not in,you're not in.

416
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,670
God,you stink.

417
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,920
- I showered.- You smell like formaldehyde.

418
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:14,150
Why do you smell like death?

419
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,640
Why do you smell like death?

420
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,480
Uh...

421
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,790
- I see dead people.- get out.

422
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,880
I need off my hunt case,so in a one-time-only offer,

423
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,190
I'm gonna trade you my beaten-to-a-pulp traumapalooza patient for no less than,

424
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:33,020
uh,three of your cadavers.

425
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,480
Pony up.

426
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:36,700
Deal,take three

427
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:41,710
I need to be with people--

428
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,630
preferably live people-- but whatever.

429
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,650
Alex,by the way,thank you for bringing me the corpses.

430
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,270
It was very sweet.

431
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:55,090
Dr. Hunt and Dr. Sloan are still operating.

432
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:57,070
- Do you think I could try- no.

433
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:00,930
Hey,so check this out,my dead mommy taught me a cool way to hold these instruments.

434
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:04,590
If youalm it,you can switch off faster.

435
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,460
When your dead mommy teaches you things,can you see her?

436
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:09,450
No.

437
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,500
I'm reading her journals.

438
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:13,840
DuH.I was kidding...******

439
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:17,160
I did see her once,though,and that bomb squad guy...

440
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,410
and denny.

441
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,330
Today?

442
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:23,710
No.

443
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:25,280
I was dead at the time.

444
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:29,060
I still feel my mom with me sometimes.

445
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,200
I gotta get off this case.

446
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:37,090
- Could I- no.

447
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:42,350
Please don't be in there.

448
00:23:55,390 --> 00:24:01,040
Dr. Hahn,I came to apologize and ask if I could please be let off your service.

449
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,750
No.

450
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:05,940
If I can convince mike to have another ablation,

451
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:09,960
you're gonna be there to see him through,to look him in the eye,

452
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:13,420
to help him through the pain that you have caused him.

453
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,580
And if he dies,I want you there for that,too,because you're responsible.

454
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,270
He decided.

455
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:21,780
He won't do another procedure.

456
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,040
I'm going to...

457
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,420
go check him out.

458
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,900
Dr. Stevens...

459
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,740
she'll be okay.

460
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:41,230
This has...

461
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:43,960
this has been coming for a long time.

462
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:47,120
She'll be okay.She'll...

463
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:49,310
she'll move on.

464
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:53,580
If you die...

465
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,700
she will not get over it.

466
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,020
She will not move on.

467
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:02,380
She'll think she can,she'll even think she has,and then...

468
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:04,360
out of the blue,you'll be right there with her,

469
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:08,980
so close she'll think she can touch you,and then all of this will just...

470
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,320
be happening for her all over again.

471
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,770
And she will not be able to move on.

472
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,330
they're--they're not doing anything.

473
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,680
Make them do something.They're just standing around.

474
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,890
Mr. Bullard,they're keeping her comfortable.

475
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:31,080
That's all they can do.

476
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:36,430
You and rosie agreed there would be no extreme measures taken if her time came.

477
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,720
- Well,her time is here.- What's g on?

478
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:43,470
Uh,she's coding,and Mr. Bullard is reconsidering the D.N.R. Order.

479
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,140
Ed,this is what I warned you about,this moment.

480
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:51,680
Even if we try to resuscitate her,I'm not sure she's gonna wake up again.

481
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:55,590
Nothing more we can do.

482
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:05,080
rosie.

483
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,800
rosie?

484
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,670
Honey?

485
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,170
Rosie?

486
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:21,390
no.

487
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,360
no.Stay with me,rosie.

488
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,010
Rosie?

489
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:34,580
Stay with me.

490
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:36,650
Don't leave me,rosie.

491
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,370
stay with me,rosie.

492
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,520
Don't leave me.Stay with me.

493
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,410
Stayith me,rosie.

494
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:44,720
Stay with me.Come back,rosie.

495
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:47,250
Don't leave me.Stay with me.

496
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:51,450
Don't leave me.Stay with me,rosie.Stay with me.

497
00:26:51,620 --> 00:27:03,850
stay with me.Don't leave me,rosie.

498
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:05,440
No...

499
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,560
Mr. Bullard...

500
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,870
- do something for her then.Do something.- I'm so sorry.Mr. Bullard.

501
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,340
- No!- No!

502
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:12,900
- Now--just- let m be.

503
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:16,470
Please,rosie.Please.

504
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,880
I'm glad you decided to try again.

505
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:24,520
You can thank Dr. Stevens.

506
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,860
It's her fault we're here,right?

507
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:29,490
Vitals are stable.He's ready for the injecti.

508
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:32,100
All right.Alcohol is going in.

509
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,210
Oh,wait.Wait,don'T.

510
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,560
Mike,look at me.

511
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:38,160
Just stay with me.

512
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,800
It's going to hurt,but not as much as you think it's going to.

513
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,580
okay,he's in S.V.T.

514
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:49,640
There may be alcohol backing into his A.V. Node.

515
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:51,400
Get him to cough.Get him to breathe.

516
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,900
Mike,you need to breathe.

517
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,090
Cough for me.

518
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:57,080
Look at me,mike.look at mE.

519
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,700
he's in v-tach,losing consciousness.

520
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:13,330
All right,push 100 of lidocaine.get the pacer ready.

521
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,620
oh,N.It's lexie.

522
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,730
I gotta go.

523
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,720
Beaten-to-a-pulp guy is coding.

524
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,080
Oh,no.

525
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,470
Pulp guy is mine.

526
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,980
We traded.

527
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,520
why didn't you put in a chest tube?

528
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,190
Well,I was-- I don't know how.

529
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,010
What do you mean,you don't know how?

530
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,450
I mean,I learned that in my first week.

531
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,610
Yes,you learned,you know.

532
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:42,160
But I will never know because you not only won't let me try one,

533
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:45,920
but you--you hog all our robots and you steal our corpses.

534
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:48,340
Dude,I think you broke her.

535
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,450
Vitals are stable for now.

536
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,100
- Was there this much blood in his urine before?- No.

537
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,710
Well,he's gonna need a bedside cystogram.

538
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:59,960
- Dibs on that.- No,no,no,it's mine,and his bladderepair is mine,too.

539
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:01,690
- No,we traded for him.I get his bladder.- No,no,you see

540
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:03,560
No,we never traded,and just to prove yourong,three,

541
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,680
next time this guy crashes,you put in his chest tube.

542
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,740
Get away from that man right now.

543
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:13,150
- Uh,he was crashing,so we upped his dopamine and gave- are yodeaf,karev?

544
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,910
I said sp away from him.

545
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:16,380
I'm just saying that we were saving his life.

546
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:18,640
No,what you did was pick over him like vultures,

547
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:20,330
like a bunch of children fighting over toys.

548
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:23,340
What you did was treat a man that's fighting to live as if he's already dead.

549
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:26,460
You have no sense,no decency and no respect!

550
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:33,300
Just get out.Just get out of here.

551
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:02,040
ed...

552
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:05,100
rosemary's gone.

553
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,920
Her heart is no longer beating on its own.

554
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:14,090
The second you stop doing what you're doing,it will stop.

555
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:17,650
I-I can't be the one...

556
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,290
to let her go...

557
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,240
to let her die.

558
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,690
I...

559
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,190
I know.

560
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:28,310
I know you can'T.

561
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,060
Here you go.Sit down.

562
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,920
Sit down.

563
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:05,970
Dr. Bailey.

564
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,630
all right,let's get the crash cart in here.

565
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,470
mike...

566
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:23,220
open your eyes.

567
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,260
Just stay here with me.

568
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,510
I need you to fight,mike.

569
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,380
Fight to stay with elyse.

570
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:31,560
You have to live through this.

571
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,820
You need to breathe right now.

572
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,520
Right now!

573
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,210
Right now!

574
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:23,260
you don't have to do it.

575
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,620
Let me.

576
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:25,770
Let me.

577
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,090
********

578
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:58,200
 Ng,I'll need you to,uh,bring me the post-op report on

579
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,340
our beating victim before you leave tonight.

580
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:01,680
I'm sorry.

581
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,240
I'm sorry.Did you say something?

582
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,780
Yang,what is wrong with you?

583
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,540
Sir?

584
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,940
I've had women opt for needless elective buttock enhancement surgery

585
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,860
just for another chance to be flirted with by me.

586
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:16,970
So what's your deal?

587
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:19,640
I have no idea what you're talking about.

588
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,900
I've been hitting on you all day.

589
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:25,370
oh.

590
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,890
I...Really?

591
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:32,010
Excuse me.

592
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,250
it was a stupid idea.

593
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:37,670
it wasn't even my idea.It was shepherd's idea.

594
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:39,110
Oh,come on.

595
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,870
That woman is not a single malt scotch,my friend.

596
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:46,070
She is bad,cheap wine that gives you a headache you can feel in your teeth.

597
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,310
Oh,Dr. Hunt.

598
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:54,270
Any thoughts on the second years after today?

599
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,000
It's only been a day,sir.

600
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:58,640
Well,of course.

601
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:03,260
They're undisciplined,inarticulate,and they have a lot to learn about respect.

602
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,770
Mostly,they're more interested in their personal crap than in anything else,

603
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:08,340
and I'm not sure that they're being taught anything different.

604
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:10,670
Honestly,I'm not sure I'll be staying on.

605
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:12,710
Excuse me,sir.

606
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,160
Tell me I am not seeing what I'm seeing.

607
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:31,450
Tell me I am not seeing a roomful of human bodies half-open,scattered and forgotten about.

608
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:32,800
They're unclaimed bodies.

609
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,230
Unclaimed?

610
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:39,050
Each of one of these people was loved.

611
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:47,750
Each one of these people was somebody's somebody,so we are responsible for treating them as such.

612
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:52,330
We claim them and treat them with respect!

613
00:34:55,660 --> 00:35:01,040
Close them up,cover them up,and put them back where they belong.

614
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,300
Now!

615
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,990
The wife's here,of the beating victim.

616
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:19,900
- She I.D.'Ed her husband,so she wanted to- what's his name?

617
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,610
I wondered if you asked r her husband's name so that he could become a person to you.

618
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,270
They're all people,yang.

619
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:30,680
This is not a game or a contest or a competition to see who gets a surgery and who don'T.

620
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:33,100
They're people,and we get to save them.

621
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,860
Now you're good.You're excellent.

622
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:38,200
You could win all the contests,but if that's why you're doing this,then you shouldn't be.

623
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:41,790
So did you find out his name?

624
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:00,530
My dad died when I was 9,in a car accident.

625
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:02,370
I was with him in the car.

626
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:07,870
While we waited for the ambulance,I tried to keep his chest closed so he wouldn't bleed so much.

627
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,140
When he died...

628
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,370
my hands...

629
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,640
felt his heart stop beating.

630
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,550
That's why I do this.

631
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,450
It's also why I win all the contests.

632
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:33,440
The patient's name is tom.

633
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,630
single malt scotch.

634
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:52,320
We're born,we live,we die.

635
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:56,340
Sometimes not necessarily in that order.

636
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,880
clear!

637
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,640
yes!

638
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,640
You don't get to die!

639
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:08,260
nice job.

640
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:09,540
Oh,hi.

641
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,620
Um...thanks.I,uh...

642
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,660
you know,he's just a robot.

643
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:20,490
Uh,I want to take back what I said before about leaving.

644
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,060
I was overreacting.I was just...

645
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:27,260
it was personal,and I wondered if you could just forget about it.

646
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:29,860
Get some sleep,Dr. Hunt.

647
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:31,910
See you tomorrow.

648
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,550
Chief?

649
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,570
Good save,o'malley.

650
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,580
Thank you.

651
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:52,120
We put things to rest...

652
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:57,370
Only to have them rise up again.

653
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,430
I'm in.

654
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,800
"so I ended my day with a segmental colectomy.

655
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:14,300
" Oh,badass.

656
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:16,590
Oh,sloan?

657
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,170
Seriously?

658
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:21,300
what?Oh,did you think we'd double-date?

659
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:25,030
- Look,I'm gonna take my pants off,so unless you want to stay and see- nope.

660
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:28,050
I'll see it later.

661
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,580
I'm gonna go downstairs.

662
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:34,210
So if death is not the end,what can you count on anymore?

663
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,710
So how's your patient doing?

664
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:39,820
Well,he still needs a heart,but I bought him some time.

665
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:41,650
Good,I'm glad.

666
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:45,470
I went to the chief about izzie stevens,and he completely shut me down.

667
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:48,480
Well,we'll see what he says when I report this to U.N.O.S.

668
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:50,580
Wait,why?

669
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,750
What...what good would come of that?

670
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:53,980
What do you mean?

671
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,140
What possible good would it do?

672
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:57,030
I mean,would it benefit your patient's outcome or--

673
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:00,100
my patient wouldn't be here if it wasn't for her.

674
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,400
So you're gonna report this to U.N.O.S.And cost this hospital its transplant certification,

675
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:08,700
cost our patients organs,cost people their jobs,cost izzie stevens her career?

676
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:12,060
Wait,so you're taking izzie stevens' side in this over mine?

677
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,650
She's a doctor,one of our doctors.

678
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:15,840
There's a reason we have each others' backs,erica.

679
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:18,850
Oh,please do not talk to me about a code,because this is not that.

680
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:20,410
No,this is that.

681
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,470
Look,I don't know what happened between denny duquette and izzie stevens that night,

682
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,980
but unless you were in the middle of that situation,

683
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,370
I don't see how you can make a judgment.

684
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,750
Easy.There's right and there's wrong.

685
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:33,140
And this was wrong and illegal.

686
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:38,400
There is no gray area here you can't kind of think this is okay.

687
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:41,420
You can't kind of side with izzie stevens.

688
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,790
And you can't kind of be a lesbian.

689
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,500
Yes,I can.

690
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,980
Because you sure can't count on anything in life.

691
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,520
I can't believe I didn't know this.

692
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:56,310
- Erica,the chief is right.- No,you.

693
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:58,880
I don't know you at all.

694
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:09,810
Life is the most fragile,unstable,unpredictable thing there is.

695
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,590
No.

696
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,970
No.

697
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:36,850
You can't be here.

698
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,530
I have to move on.I...

699
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:45,950
I love you,and I will always love you,but I have to move on.

700
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:49,930
That's why I had that patient today and that'S...

701
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:53,360
why I helped save his life,so that I wouldn't feel guilty anymore and I can move on.

702
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,850
So please...

703
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:58,110
you have to go.

704
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,360
Go where?

705
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:02,990
are you okay?

706
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,440
Yes.

707
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,750
Yes.

708
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,490
I am totally okay.

709
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,970
I'm fine.Everything's fine.

710
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:14,030
- I have to change,but I'll meet you at the bar,okay?- All right.

711
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:15,620
Okay.

712
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:22,850
In fact,there's only one thing about life we can be sure of...

713
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:32,510
are you sure you're okay?
