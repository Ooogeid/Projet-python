1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,600
It's intense, what
happens in the o.R.

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,400
When lives are on the line...

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,600
And you're poking at brains
like they're silly putty.

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,200
You form a bond

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,000
With the surgeons
right next to you...

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,200
An unbreakable, indescribable bond.

7
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,600
It's intimate, being
tied together like that...

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,900
You up? No.

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,500
Yes. Whether you like it or not,

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,100
Whether you like them or
not, you become family.

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,000
The wicked witch is dead.

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,900
Metaphorically dead or dead dead?

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,900
Who are we talking about?

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,100
Hahn. Hahn.

15
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,900
Her name is off the surgical board.

16
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,200
Her surgeries have been canceled.

17
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:50,100
I don't know how or why,
but I do know hahn is gone.

18
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,700
That's too bad. She
was really talented.

19
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,200
You're not talking to me.

20
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,100
Hi.

21
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:09,700
Hi.

22
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,000
Is, uh, grey home?

23
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,400
Yes.

24
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,800
Death?

25
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,400
Come on. Where are you, death?

26
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,800
Death?! Aah!

27
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,500
Die! Oh, my
god! It's been--

28
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,500
Forever. Oh.

29
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,000
Oh, wow. You look like...

30
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,400
Death! Death!

31
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,900
Is the guy in the
pajamas your boyfriend?

32
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,700
'cause if so, then hot. Right?

33
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,200
Uh, hey. Uh... Who are you?

34
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,800
I'm sadie. Who are you?

35
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,800
I'm--i'm--i'm
cristina.

36
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,100
Wow.

37
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,900
Apparently they went backpacking

38
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,600
Around europe together
or something... Mm.

39
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,900
Before med school.

40
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,400
You know that woman all but
kicked me out of the bed?

41
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,900
That's terrible.

42
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,100
And death? Meredith's name
is not death. It's mer.

43
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,500
I really feel for you.

44
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,800
You know, she's never
even mentioned this woman.

45
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,300
I mean, how good of
a friend can she be?

46
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,200
Good enough to kick
us both out of bed

47
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,700
Welcome to my world.

48
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,800
This woman is the reason

49
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,900
I went to med school
in the first place.

50
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,700
I figured if a slacker like death...

51
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,800
Mer. Mer. Could handle slicing
people open, then I could, too.

52
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,900
Meredith's not a slacker. Ooh,
I could tell you some stories.

53
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,200
But you won't. So, sadie,
you postponed your residency

54
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,100
To work in a morgue?

55
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,500
Yeah, you know, a lot
of the fun cutting,

56
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,900
None of the rules, but I got bored.

57
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Started craving blood
that was flowing.

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,400
And now you're here. I
can't believe you're here.

59
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,500
Yay.

60
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,900
Iz, you coming?

61
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,700
Yeah. I just need a minute.

62
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,200
Look, I get it. Hahn's case
brought up the denny thing.

63
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,900
But hahn's not even here anymore.

64
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,600
It's stuff from the past.

65
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,200
Stuff from the past, iz.

66
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,600
You don't understand.

67
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,800
I might...

68
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,400
If you'd talk to me.

69
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,600
Fine.

70
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,100
See you inside.

71
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,900
I'm walking.

72
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,600
Morning.

73
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,900
Walking straight
ahead, all by myself.

74
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,100
You know, you look
good. Tired, but good.

75
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,200
Did I mention I find the
short hair kind of sassy?

76
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,300
Now I'm turning this
corner, again, all alone.

77
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,000
Ouch.

78
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,100
Um...

79
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,200
These are s--uh,
scratches from my kitten.

80
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,000
He's a crazy scratchy scratcher.

81
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,100
You're a cat person?

82
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,400
I meant hairbrush.

83
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,400
It--it--i have a crazy
scratchy hairbrush.

84
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,600
Solo surgeries are
at stake here, three.

85
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,200
I can't have you acting weird

86
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,400
Or wounded.

87
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,400
I'm--i am on top
of my game. Really.

88
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,400
I'm sending you to plastics,
far, far away. Just go.

89
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,800
Hey, what do you know about
a heart guy named dixon?

90
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,500
Dixon? Uh, no, not a guy.
I've heard of virginia dixon.

91
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,200
She's got an incredible
record. Really low mortal--

92
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,800
Wait. Is she coming
here? Yeah. Today.

93
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,400
Piggyback heart
transplant. I'm on the case.

94
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,000
What? What? W-why
am I not on the case?

95
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,900
So she's your pre-cristina cristina?

96
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,200
You gonna tell me why
she calls you death?

97
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,100
Oh, no. The adventures of dea and die

98
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,500
Are better left untold. Hey,

99
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,500
Pedia's julienning her
skinny little chickearms

100
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,500
And still no word on
what made "h" hitch a ride

101
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,900
With her flying monkeys.
Later. Translate that for me.

102
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,000
Lexie may be a secret cutter,

103
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,900
And there's still no
word on why hahn quit.

104
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,600
Is that true, about lexie? I
don't know. How would I know?

105
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,500
If it's true, what are you
gonna do about it? Nothing.

106
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,200
Meredith, you can't do
nothing. She's your sister. And?

107
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,000
And you're family.
I'm not understanding.

108
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,600
Lexie is your family.

109
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,600
Forget it.

110
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,500
Hello, dr. Hunt.

111
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,400
Dr. Yang.

112
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,600
Thank you.

113
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Hey, what do we got?

114
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,200
Uh, crush injuries.
Couple minutes out.

115
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,300
Hey, w-what do you know about hahn?

116
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,700
Um, she's gone.

117
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,800
Yeah, but why? I don't know.

118
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,400
You two are friends. I don't
want to talk about it, okay?

119
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,700
I want blood and guts
and mangled bones.

120
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,400
I want a guy so badly smashed
up, it takes all day to fix him.

121
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,400
I want to rock a surgery. I don't
want to talk about hahn. Okay, okay.

122
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,100
Unidentified man with
prolonged extrication time.

123
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,500
They had to fish him out
of a working garbage truck.

124
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,300
Multiple crush injuries,
open fractures, g.C.S. 3,

125
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,400
And we couldn't unhook him
in the field. Unhook him?

126
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,400
His femur's broken in half,
and it's puncturing his torso.

127
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,600
He's impaled.

128
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,600
Impaled on himself?

129
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,400
Human pretzel.

130
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,000
That'll do.

131
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,600
Wow.

132
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,000
Check his popliteal pulse.

133
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,300
I'm getting nothing. That's
because his knee is over here.

134
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,400
You think he was
sleeping in that dumpster

135
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,700
And they started crushing
the trash? That's a bad day.

136
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,800
Here I am.What did I miss?

137
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,800
It's your first day.Why don't
you just stand back and shut up?

138
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,600
Breath sounds are clear and equal

139
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,300
both sides.Unbelievable

140
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,400
So no punctured lung.We need a
portable x-ray and an ultrasound

141
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,800
Someone paged us?I did

142
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,100
you did? that's a first.

143
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,600
So is this. I've seen a lot
of trauma-Guys cut in half

144
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,200
amputations, eviscerations.But I
have never seen anything like this

145
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,300
I wondered if you could help.

146
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,700
You hire when you're
number 1, not number 12.

147
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,100
But I need you to be
my ambassador today.

148
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,900
Show dr. Dixon what
seattle grace is all about.

149
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,800
I've thrown a lot
of money, a big title

150
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,000
And a lot of research dollars at her.

151
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,000
But... But what?

152
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,900
Um... She's a little different.

153
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,100
She's a little off.

154
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,800
So we're wooing today, bailey.
I can woo with the best of 'em.

155
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,200
So, what, dixon is
a nut job? Excuse me?

156
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,100
I'm just saying, I've
already had my quota of crazy

157
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,700
For the year. Hey, I've had my
off days. You want to judge me?

158
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,700
You never even met the woman, karev.

159
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:06,400
Now you heard the chief. Our job
is to impress dr. Dixon today,

160
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,000
So be impressive. I've got
the chart for dr. Dixon.

161
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,100
I'm ready to work. I'm excited.

162
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,700
Don't be. She's off. Karev.

163
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,300
You okay?

164
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,200
Yeah.

165
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,100
All right. Heads-up. Here she comes.

166
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,000
Oh, dr. Dixon. H-hi.

167
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,000
Welcome to, uh, seattle grace.

168
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,900
We're very happy to h-have you here.

169
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,100
I'm--i'm dr. Bailey. I-i
brought my own lab coat.

170
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,500
I'm here to perform a
heart transplant today.

171
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,500
I do hearts.

172
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,800
A procedure invented by
christiaan barnard in 1967.

173
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,600
I do hearts.

174
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,300
Uh, i--i'm dr. Richard
webber. We spoke on the phone.

175
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,700
Karev, would you get dr.
Dixon the latest labs?

176
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,900
Stevens, let's prep
the patient, please.

177
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,100
Okay, then. She's a little off.

178
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,900
His femur's in pieces,

179
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,500
I mean, except for the part
that's stuck in his torso.

180
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,000
There's no way I'm saving that leg.

181
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,200
It looks like the impaled piece
is lodged under his clavicle

182
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,200
C-spine looks clear. Without a c.T.,

183
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,000
It's hard to be sure. And
why can't we get a c.T. Scan

184
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,100
The way he's impaled, it's
hard to get a clear reading.

185
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,500
You know, there is such a
thing as a stupid question.

186
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,000
Stand over there. Guys, guys, we
have a very limited window here, okay?

187
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,500
With vitals like these,
in a few more hours--

188
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,400
His body won't be able to
withstand surgery at all

189
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,000
Good thing he's unconscious.
Well, we can't do anything

190
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,500
Till we dislodge the femur from his

191
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,500
Clavicle. Okay, then
let's unimpale him

192
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,700
Yang, grey, new kid, hold
his shoulders. Brace him hard.

193
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,700
I'll hold his c-spine.
I got his torso.

194
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,700
I need to guide the
posterior hip dislocation.

195
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,100
The second that leg is out,
be ready to assert pressure

196
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,700
To stop the bleeding. Got it?
Better thaworking on corpses, huh?

197
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,800
On the count of three. One...

198
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:45,900
Two...

199
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,700
Three.

200
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,800
Okay, push directly on
the clavicle while I pull.

201
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,300
Femur's really wedged in there. Okay,
almost there. Almost there. Steady.

202
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,000
Just a little bit further.
S-sloan, I need you to, um,

203
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,400
Rotate his knee to my right.

204
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,700
Push 10 of morphine now!
Oh, gee. Okay, all right.

205
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,900
Up, up, up, up. Just get in
there and hold the pressure.

206
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,000
Okay, get his femur stabilized
and down by his side.

207
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,900
Hurry! Hold pressure.

208
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,800
Get in there. Come on. Aah!

209
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,600
Corpses don't do that.

210
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,700
I need you to calm down,
sir. What are you doing to me?

211
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,300
Sir, can you tell us your name? Get
out of my face! Get your hands off!

212
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:32,400
You're hurting me! Do as he
says. Hands off, everybody.

213
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,200
But--
hands off.

214
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,000
Thank you.

215
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,700
What's your name?

216
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,900
Timothy miller.

217
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,400
Mr. Miller, w-we need
to get you into surgery.

218
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,700
I'm gonna be able to walk,
right? I gotta be able to walk.

219
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,500
Right now, we're just
trying to keep you alive.

220
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,600
Our cardiac wing is extensive

221
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,900
And well-equipped
with all of-

222
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,700
The first successful heart transplant

223
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,100
Was performed on september 7, 1896,

224
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,800
By dr. Ludwig rehn,
frankfurt, germany.

225
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,300
Okay.

226
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,700
Uh, excuse me. I don't
mean to interrupt. Uh--

227
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,300
Please inter--
I mean, just, uh,

228
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,900
Please update dr.
Dixon on the patient.

229
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,700
Uh, dr. Stevens is prepping

230
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,600
Your transplant patient for surgery.

231
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,200
They scheduled a-a-a
transplant six years ago,

232
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,000
But the heart was too
small, so they doubled up

233
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And added a donor heart to
help his own heart function.

234
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,400
They did a piggyback--
heterotopic transplant.

235
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,600
Piggyback is the colloquial
name for the procedure.

236
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,700
Don't do that.

237
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,800
Don't do that.

238
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,000
How about we... Take
you to meet the patient?

239
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,400
They tell my heart belonged
to a girl that was hit by a car

240
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,800
While she was hitchhiking.

241
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,800
And now when I'm driving, I
see hitchhikers all the time,

242
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,400
Always up ahead, just up ahead,

243
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,400
But when I get up
ahead, they're gone.

244
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,200
You're not buying
any of this, are you?

245
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,800
I should never have gotten the heart.

246
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,700
I-i don't understand
how the heart--

247
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,400
Navajos--we don't
even touch the dead

248
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,100
We don't touch their
bodies or belongings

249
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,000
Because the spirit clings there.

250
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,900
So to have part of a dead
body sewed into my chest is...

251
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,200
My friends who follow the old ways,

252
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,300
They begged me not to do
it. I should've listened.

253
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

254
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,200
You think you're haunted
by your transplanted heart,

255
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,500
But you're here for a new transplant.

256
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,200
No! That's what I'm
trying to tell you

257
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,400
I don't want it. I
don't want the new one.

258
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,800
I just want you to take the old one
out. Wait. That's just plain stupid.

259
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,500
Take the heart, man. Take
the heart if they offer it.

260
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,900
Did he just say he doesn't want
the donor heart? Yes, ma'am.

261
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,800
Clay bedonie, are you aware
that without a new heart,

262
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,600
You'll live a short life
attached to a machine

263
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,900
Before dying a sudden
and agonizing death?

264
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,100
See, that--that's
what I'm talking about.

265
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,100
Five parallel pulley
stitches per cut, then switch.

266
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,400
You sure I'm numb?

267
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,400
Toughen up.

268
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,400
When one of our residents gets
picked for the solo surgery,

269
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,800
One of us gets to scrub
in, so we have a goal here.

270
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,700
Focus on the goal. Solo
surgeries. Totally worth it.

271
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,100
Solo... Surgeries. Totally worth it.

272
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,100
Hello, hello. I need
someone to run these labs

273
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,000
And pull these x-rays, please.

274
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,100
Will do.

275
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,200
Hey, this looks like a
cool place to hang out.

276
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,900
What are you guys doing?

277
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,600
This is for interns.
It's--it's our hangout.

278
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,800
Go find your own.

279
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,200
Sorry.

280
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,600
Solo surgeries.

281
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,400
Totally worth it.

282
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,300
I don't want to live if I can't walk.

283
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,300
We'll do our best to save
the leg-- I'm homeless.

284
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,600
Walking is how I survive.

285
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,300
It's how i... Get from
one day to the next.

286
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,800
Marion street's safe
from 2:00 to 6:00 a.M.

287
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,100
And then I go over
the half-mast bridge,

288
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,000
And I hang there till 6:30
until the traffic hits.

289
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,400
And then I go over to belltown
and hang out on the waterfront.

290
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,800
And then the waterfront,

291
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,400
If it's trouble, then I
go back up to 4th street.

292
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,500
I'm homeless. I-i can't not walk.

293
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,800
I-i--what am I gonna
do? What am I gonna do?

294
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,100
Your injuries are critical.
If we n't get you to surgery--

295
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,200
Will your surgery make me walk?

296
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,300
Huh?

297
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,200
Then I don't want it!

298
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,600
Okay. All right.

299
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,000
You heard the man. The surgery's off.

300
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,800
I appreciate you trying
to advise me to do

301
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,900
What you think is best.

302
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,500
These are facts, not
opinions. What'm saying is--

303
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,300
He's trying to say he would
rather live a shorter life

304
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,500
That's unhaunted than
a longer one that is.

305
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I'm not saying I agree. I'm just...

306
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,400
I'm just gonna stand over here.

307
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,800
That's a good idea.

308
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,400
The heart that you take out
of me, what happens to it?

309
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,900
It goes from the o.R. To
pathology to medical waste.

310
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,800
I need that heart back for ritual.

311
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,900
We have laws. There are rules.

312
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,800
Rules are rules.

313
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,600
Maybe there's a
compromise to be made here.

314
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,500
Uh, we could, I don't know,

315
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,100
Uh, give him back the old
heart to do the ritual,

316
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,600
Then give him a chance to live

317
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,900
By still putting
the new heart in. No.

318
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,100
No. It doesn't work that way.

319
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,600
I will still be haunted,
just by a new ghost.

320
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,000
There are rules. We have
laws, and there are--

321
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Rules are rules and laws are laws.

322
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,200
No.

323
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,800
So that's it?

324
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,900
No surgery? You're
just gonna walk away?

325
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,400
I'm respecting the patient's wishes.

326
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,400
The patient's unstable
with an open wound.

327
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,600
Which we are packing.

328
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,500
This guy is circling the drain.
You cannot just walk away.

329
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,000
Don't tell me how to run
things in my e.R. Your e.R.?

330
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,800
We save lives here.

331
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,600
We don't just patch up
patients and leave them to die.

332
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,800
If you can't handle that,

333
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,200
Go back  the desert and leave us here

334
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,700
To do our jobs.

335
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:19,400
Dr. Torres, please tell me
you can figure out some way

336
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,400
Well, the right femur's toast.

337
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,900
So is the hip and half the pelvis,

338
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:35,500
But if I put some pins here
and maybe a plate here...

339
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,300
I mean, there are some
viable bone fragments.

340
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,700
We're not starting from nothing.
What do you think? I think it's wild.

341
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,100
All right, she wasn't talking to you.

342
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,500
It's her first day.
Could you not be so-

343
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,800
No, she's an intern. She
needs to learn her place.

344
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,500
I think it's a lot of hardware.

345
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,800
What the guy needs
is a whole new leg.

346
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,100
Well, maybe I can do that.

347
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,100
Yeah, I mean, it's kind of a puzzle.

348
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,100
I just need to figure out

349
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,600
What equipment I need
and--and how to pull it off.

350
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,900
Like lincoln logs. Uh, it's a
little more high-tech than that.

351
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,400
It's exactly like lincoln logs.

352
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,900
Okay, I need you guys to grab

353
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,600
Every piece of titanium we've
got in the hospital. Okay.

354
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,000
Um, I need the hospital
rules to specify the fact

355
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,700
That we must respect all religious

356
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,600
And spiritual beliefs
of our patients.

357
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,300
The rules?

358
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,400
Yeah, I'm asking
you to declare a rule

359
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,700
Of our department.

360
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,300
That we respect the
beliefs of our patients?

361
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,900
Yes. Isn't that just common courtesy?

362
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,700
Yes. Then why am I declaring it?

363
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:36,800
Um... Dr. Dixon doesn't
do common courtesy,

364
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,300
But she understands rules.

365
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,200
So if it's a rule, we're golden.

366
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,700
If not, we have a pissed-off patient

367
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,800
An apoplectic surgeon,
and none of those things

368
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,500
Makes for a successful procedure

369
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,800
On a faulty heart,

370
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,800
Not to mention the failure to woo.

371
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,900
You want me to announce it as a rule.

372
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,900
I'm here's a witness, you can
maybe raise your right hand,

373
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:00,600
Put your left one

374
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,600
On the "physicians' desk reference."

375
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,700
It's a rule.

376
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,100
Thank you.

377
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,300
Dr. Dixon, I'm cristina
yang. I'm a resident here,

378
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,800
And I've been focused on cardio
since I began my internship.

379
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,700
I'm certainly looking forward
to anything that you might--

380
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,300
Were the other ones
taken off my case?

381
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,300
Oh, uh, what other ones?

382
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,900
The black one, the male one,
the one with yellow hair.

383
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,300
Not that I'm aware of.

384
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,000
Then why are you talking to me?

385
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,200
What happened to hahn?

386
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,400
Wh-whatever made hahn
leave, it can be fixed.

387
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,600
U-unless she a was fired.
She wasn't fired, was she?

388
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,400
She's not coming back.
You don't know that.

389
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,300
She kinda does.

390
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,300
How?

391
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,000
Because she doesn't...

392
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,200
Look, it's just too...

393
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:03,900
We had a fight.

394
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,000
Oh, please. Meredith
and I fight all the time.

395
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,400
We still work together.

396
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,100
It's not like hahn was your
girlfriend or something.

397
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,700
Oh, my god.

398
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,300
She was your girlfriend?

399
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,000
Look, we hadn't...

400
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,500
Figured it all out.

401
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,800
Wait, so are you a lesbian now?

402
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,200
I don't know. Maybe
you were a once-bian.

403
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,800
Or a twice-bian.
Whatever. It's over.

404
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,900
Are you okay?

405
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,400
She's fine. Leave her alone.

406
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,500
I hit the titanium mother lode.

407
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,400
Hi.

408
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,400
Hey.

409
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,000
Oh, come on. Really?

410
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,500
Hey, lexie.

411
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,900
How are you?

412
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,700
Is, uh, everything going okay?

413
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,900
Why, did somebody say something,

414
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,100
Like I was doing something?

415
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,800
No, I'm just, uh, you
know, as, uh, I'm asking

416
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,700
As a person who's
sort of related to you

417
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,200
If there's anything
bothering you-- so

418
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,000
This is completely not
as a boss or a residen

419
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,500
Or a superior keeping
an eye on what I do

420
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,100
As a student in this program? No,
no, I'm just a compassionate person,

421
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,100
And I'm just wondering if you're

422
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,200
Channeling your tragic pain
into, uh, self-mutilation.

423
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,500
Are you a secret cutter? No.

424
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,300
Little grey, torres is, uh,
trying to set a world record

425
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,200
For most titanium rods
used in one patient. You in?

426
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,400
Little grey?

427
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,100
Little grey. Big grey.

428
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,200
That's how I tell you two apart.

429
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,300
Yeah, I'm in. I'll just be a minute.

430
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,000
Can't you people let
a guy die in peace?

431
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,400
Your, uh, vitals are slipping.

432
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,300
I'm not gonna lie to
you. That's not good.

433
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,900
I been through worse.

434
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,700
Yeah, I imagine you have.

435
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,700
Oh, don't get like that.

436
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,100
Don't look at me like
I'm some tragic hero

437
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,200
With a secret past.

438
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,200
You have a story.

439
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,700
We all have a story.

440
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,700
I took a turn in my life.

441
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,700
And I couldn't connect.

442
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,700
I lost...

443
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,700
I couldn't connect.

444
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,500
My life, it took a turn and...

445
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,300
And I just couldn't turn it back.

446
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,200
Guys, we need to shut
down for a few days.

447
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,000
People are starting
to get suspicious.

448
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,100
I was accused of
being a secret cutter.

449
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,600
So wear long sleeves.

450
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,800
Oh, I didn't realize we were
inviting more people here.

451
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,100
Are you kidding? A
secret intern society?

452
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,600
I'm all over that.

453
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,900
We, I still think we
need to take fewer risks.

454
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,100
Fewer risks?

455
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,900
Come on. You got a guard at the door.

456
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,400
You're using more local
anesthetic for three sutures

457
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,400
Than you would upstairs
for a chest tube.

458
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,500
Look, I get that you're doing
all this to learn new skills,

459
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,100
But you're only gonna learn
so much by being careful.

460
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,900
Uh, actually, I would disagree.

461
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,000
I think the only safe way to...

462
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,600
Who wants to stitch me up?

463
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,200
Oh, right here.

464
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,200
You gonna tell me
about death and die?

465
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,200
Nope. But I did talk to lexie for you

466
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,800
And now I need you to do
something for me. What's that?

467
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,100
I need you to tell mark
to keep his little sloan

468
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,100
Out of little grey.
Is he hitting on you?

469
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,400
No, not my little grey.
Lexie's little grey.

470
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,600
I don't know what's
going on with her,

471
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,900
But the last thing she needs

472
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,700
Is sloan going all man-whore on her.

473
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,900
So you need to tell
him to step away from

474
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,400
Little grey. All right.
I'll see what I can do

475
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,200
Little grey, derek. Little grey.

476
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,100
Did she, uh...

477
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,700
She say good-bye to you?

478
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,500
Nope.

479
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,200
Are you okay?

480
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,300
Do I look okay?

481
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,100
You look great.

482
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,400
Then I'm okay.

483
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,400
So...

484
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,100
There's a 9-day ritual

485
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,800
To--to undo
a haunting?

486
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,200
It starts with a 9-day ritual.

487
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,400
Okay.

488
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,200
Are you really gonna
waste nine days on this?

489
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,400
Dr. Stevens. Yes.

490
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,000
Why are you sonterested
in my haunting?

491
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,500
Can...

492
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,100
Can ghosts do things?

493
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,500
I mean, can they make
things happen in your life?

494
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,100
I--i've had two cases
with two patients in a row

495
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:12,100
That have really reminded
me of my dead fianc?-

496
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,300
Heart transplants
and l-vads and--

497
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:17,500
Could he be doing that? Could
he be bringing them to me?

498
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,500
Izzie, come on.

499
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,300
Is he here right now, your ghost?

500
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:29,200
I... I hate to ask, but...

501
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,500
Oh, you don't want
me in your surgery.

502
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,800
It's not that I think there's
something wrong with you.

503
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,300
It's just... I don't
need any extra ghosts

504
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,000
In my operating room.

505
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:50,900
Mr. Miller.

506
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,100
What does a guy have to do

507
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,000
To get a little peace
and quiet around here?

508
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,700
The fatigue you're feeling
is from the blood loss.

509
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,200
The queasiness,
the dizziness--

510
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,600
It's because you're
slowly bleeding to death.

511
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,200
What, are you trying
to scare him? No.

512
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,900
I'm trying to ascertain whether
he's suicidal or just defeated.

513
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,100
Mr. Miller, you
survived in the streets,

514
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,600
So I know you're a fighter.

515
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,400
That doesn't make me a fighter.

516
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,100
It makes me lucky.

517
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,500
How long you been out
there, 10 years, 20?

518
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,800
You're not in jail, you're not dead.

519
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,100
That's not luck. You're smart.

520
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,600
You gotta be smart to take
care of yourself on your own.

521
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,400
I guess.

522
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,500
This...

523
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,400
What you're doing
right now, mr. Miller,

524
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,300
Refusing surgery,

525
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,700
It's not smart.

526
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,100
There's a rehab center
not too far from here.

527
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,800
Medire takes care of
it. You could stay there.

528
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,800
Food, bed, long as you need.

529
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,900
Just let us operate.

530
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,500
Let us operate, and
we'll figure the rest out.

531
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,200
Wow. That's the fastest
I've ever seen anyone

532
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,900
Dissect through adhesions.

533
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,000
Uh, dr. Dixon, there
is a rule, uh, regarding

534
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,800
Giving medical waste to the patient.

535
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,900
Dr. Dixon?

536
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,800
What?

537
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,900
Uh, I was just saying
there is a rule,

538
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,500
An official, very,
very specific rule,

539
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:34,800
That in the event a
patient asks for their organ

540
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,700
Or body part back for any reason

541
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:41,600
Related to or involving
their cultural beliefs,

542
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:45,800
We must respect that
patient's wishes,

543
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:49,000
And return that organ to the patient.

544
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,200
That is the rule I
forgot to tell you about.

545
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,900
If I went down to
pathology right now,

546
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,300
Would they know about the rule?

547
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,400
Oh, the chief would know.

548
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,100
Uh, it's his rule. He declared it.

549
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,800
A rule's a rule.

550
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,200
Dr. Karev...

551
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,400
Make sure that...

552
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,200
We follow the chief's rule

553
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,300
And return the heart to the
patient after the surgery.

554
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,600
I'm going back to work now.

555
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,300
Clamp.

556
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,500
What the hell is that gooey thing

557
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,000
They're taking out of him?

558
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,700
Oh. The silent treatment.

559
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,900
Okay, if you're gonna be that way.

560
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,400
I'll just, uh...

561
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,800
I'll just stand here
and--and be quiet.

562
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,100
Okay, but that... That is disgusting.

563
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,600
I thought you were gonna be quiet.

564
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,500
You know, you're acting like
you don't want me to be here.

565
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,600
You know what I've wished for
every day since you've died?

566
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,300
I've wished that I
could see you again.

567
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,100
I'd have given anything
just to see you...

568
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,000
One more time.

569
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,600
Looking at you and knowing
that I can't touch you,

570
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,400
It's hurting me.

571
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,300
Izzie, you can touch me.

572
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,700
You're not real.

573
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,100
You can't be real.

574
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,700
So that means that I'm sick

575
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:26,800
Or something is wrong with
me, and I can't hope for that.

576
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,000
I...

577
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,500
I can't hope.

578
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,400
You're not real.

579
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,300
Izzie, I am as real as you

580
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,700
Or that gooey, disgusting
thing down there.

581
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,300
Touch me.

582
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,300
Izzie... Touch me.

583
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,500
I'll prove it to you.

584
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,600
No!

585
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,600
Why are you here?

586
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,500
Why?

587
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,600
I am here for you, izzie stevens.

588
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,100
Clamp.

589
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,200
Okay, that's it.

590
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,900
The donor heart is separated.

591
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,700
We have the cannulas
ready for bypass.

592
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,300
Next step is the l-vad.

593
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,500
Y--what--what
is that?

594
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,600
That's not right. That
can't be happening.

595
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,300
His heart's beating.

596
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,200
How is his heart beating on its own?

597
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,800
It... Can't be happening.
It shouldn't be happening.

598
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,300
That heart is beating.
That heart is beating.

599
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,700
It shouldn't be beating.
It sh-shouldn't be beating.

600
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,800
I've never seen a
reconstruction like this.

601
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,400
Well, I've never done one like this.

602
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,900
Here's hoping it works.

603
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,300
All right. I'm ready for the rod.

604
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,300
How are you guys doing up there?

605
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,200
A lot of hemorrhaging,
bleeding through the packing.

606
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,500
Try the fibrin sealant. Good
call. Thank you, dr. Shepherd.

607
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,400
How you doin' on that lac, little
grey? Good. Moving on to the next lac.

608
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,100
You finished already? Let me see.

609
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,000
Wow. Pulley stitches.

610
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,700
Nicely done.

611
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,400
Thank you, dr. Sloan.

612
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,800
So my heart...

613
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,900
It started beating by itself.

614
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,600
If it continues to
function like this,

615
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,100
You won't need an l-vad or
any other kind of machinery.

616
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,700
It's wonderful news.

617
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,400
It's very atypical.

618
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,800
Not for me. I'm finally free.

619
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,100
I'm not haunted anymore.

620
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,700
Your heart had six years to rest,

621
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,600
Which is... Probably enough
time for it to repair itself,

622
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,300
Which is why it
started beating again.

623
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,300
I've never seen this before.

624
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,300
I've read about it, but
I've never seen it before.

625
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:56,000
You have your beliefs. I have mine.

626
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,700
I don't have beliefs. I have science.

627
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,500
Science is a belief,

628
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,200
A belief in only what
you can see and touch.

629
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,300
I believe in more.

630
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,700
Just thought I'd stop in to
see how everything's going.

631
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,200
Well, I'm still several hours away,

632
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,600
But I may actually
pull this off--

633
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,200
Rebuilding a man's
skeleton from scratch.

634
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,800
And we just found out
that, uh, dr. Grey here

635
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,600
Can out-pulley stitch shepherd.

636
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,100
Oh, I wouldn't go so
far as to say that.

637
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,900
Excellent job, dr. Grey.

638
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,800
And excellent job of
teaching, dr. Yang.

639
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,300
Sir? Taking the time
to teach yo interns,

640
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,100
And they are retaining
that knowledge.

641
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,600
I haven't made my decision
yet on the solo surgery,

642
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,500
But you keep teaching like
that, and you're my one to watch.

643
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,500
Thank you, sir.

644
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,500
He's crashing. V-fib. Start c.P.R.

645
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,700
Push 1 of epi and charge
the paddles to 360.

646
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,600
right away

647
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,900
Clear.

648
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,300
Thank you.

649
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,300
Thank you so much.

650
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,200
So what do you do now
with the haunted piece?

651
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,800
Do you bury it or...

652
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:14,000
Burn it. Actually, my tribe's
medicine man will burn it.

653
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,000
I'm not allowed to
even touch the smoke.

654
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,400
So does the not-touching thing,

655
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,600
Does that apply to
just the flesh or--

656
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,700
No, we don't touch their belongings.

657
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:27,600
We can cleanse jewelry, medals,
but fabric, bedding, clothes,

658
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,100
Books that were owned by the dead,

659
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,600
We burn all of it.

660
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,300
The spirit can cling to any of it.

661
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,900
Oh, no.

662
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,000
Your ghost...

663
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,400
You still don't have
anything of his, do you?

664
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:55,200
Time of
death--1922.

665
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,300
I built his bones.

666
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,100
You tried.

667
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,600
We all tried.

668
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,600
No, I didn't try. I did it.

669
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,700
I did my part. I built his bones.

670
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,100
I built his bones from scratch,

671
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,600
And you...

672
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:25,100
All of you, you were
supposed to keep him alive.

673
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,700
That is all you people had to do.

674
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,200
You just had to...

675
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,000
Keep his body breathing.

676
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,500
You just had to keep him safe
and--and breathing and living

677
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,200
Until I made his bones.

678
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,400
I made... I made his bones...

679
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,600
Until... Until I made his bones.

680
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,000
I made his bones.

681
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,300
I made his bones. Why
don't you guys go ahead,

682
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,200
And I'll help dr. Torres clean up?

683
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,400
Go call the morgue. We've got it. Go.

684
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,600
Everyone, clear out.

685
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,200
Uh, excellent job today, dr. Dixon.

686
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,800
Excellent... Rule following.

687
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,100
I only have one real area
of interest--the human heart.

688
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,800
I love it. I like its regularity.

689
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,400
I know everything there
is to know about it.

690
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,000
I like its predictability.
It has rules.

691
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,300
Every chamber has a function,
every function has a movement.

692
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,400
I like the color. It's comforting.

693
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,000
Are you familiar with
asperger's syndrome,

694
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Dr. Bailey?

695
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Uh, of course.

696
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,600
A significant impairment
during social situations...

697
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,700
I'm not good at cues like
sarcasm or condescension,

698
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,400
But I do know when
I'm being manipulated,

699
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,500
And I know when I'm
being made fun of.

700
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:19,500
I don't think I like
this hospital very much.

701
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,000
I don't think I like
this hospital at all.

702
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,600
Ah, that lexie grey

703
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,600
Sure knows how to wrap
herself around a suture.

704
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,600
Mark, meredith has some concerns.

705
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,700
Well, that's not news.

706
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,700
About lexie.

707
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:43,900
Apparently lexie is... Fragile,

708
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,400
And getting involved with a superior

709
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,000
Might make her more fragile, so...

710
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,800
I was talking about her sutures.

711
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,700
Keep little sloan out of
little grey is my point. What?

712
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:54,000
Little sloan does
not enter little grey.

713
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,100
Are we clear?
Did you just say--

714
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:00,100
Okay, that's just
creepy and inaccurate.

715
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,400
Big sloan.

716
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,100
You heading home?

717
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,700
I love you.

718
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,300
I will always love you.

719
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,400
You own a piece of me.

720
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,900
So even though you'll be gone,

721
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:31,500
You will never be
forgotten, not by me.

722
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,300
I'm sorry we never got our chance.

723
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,900
I'm sorry we never...

724
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,300
Got to get married or have children

725
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,400
Or grow old together.

726
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,000
I wanted that so much.

727
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,000
I wanted to be your
wife morehan anything.

728
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,800
Why are you telling me this?

729
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,800
I'm trying to let you go

730
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,000
So that your soul can be at peace.

731
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,200
But I have peace, izzie.

732
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,500
I'm here for you.

733
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,100
Good-bye, denny.

734
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,200
I love you.

735
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,600
But good-bye.

736
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,500
I can explain.

737
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I did not teach you the
parallel pulley stitch.

738
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,800
I can barely do that stitch myself.

739
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,400
Whatever you guys are
doing, shut it down.

740
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,300
Do not practice on
yourselves. That is insane.

741
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,400
Shut it down.

742
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,900
Iz?

743
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,200
I see you.

744
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,100
I've seen you all day.

745
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,100
I-i see you struggling.

746
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,500
And I know you don't want my help,

747
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,000
But let me help you.

748
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,100
Whatever it is, I can help.

749
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,900
So let me.

750
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,200
Will you burn this for me?

751
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,500
I hate how hard it is.

752
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,500
It's just, like, you
get attached to someone,

753
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,000
And then they work
their way into your life,

754
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
And then you wake
up one day-- suddenly

755
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,900
All you can think
about is their little..

756
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,400
Another round?

757
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,800
Oh, I'll get it.

758
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,000
Tell me the stories.

759
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,700
What stories?

760
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,600
The ones you won't let sadie tell me.

761
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,500
They're ancient history.

762
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,800
Humiliating and ridiculous.

763
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,700
Ridiculous is a grown man
telling another grown man

764
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,100
To stay out of a
woman's little--

765
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,100
You did it?

766
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,700
I did, those exact words.

767
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,500
I did it because...

768
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,800
It was nice to see you
sticking up for your sister.

769
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,600
I did it for you.

770
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,300
So now you owe me...

771
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,700
A story.

772
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,800
Okay, fine.

773
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,400
But you can never tell anyone, ever.

774
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,700
I'm--i'm sorry we
lost him, the patient.

775
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,300
I'm--i'm
sorry.

776
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,000
I don't need you to be sorry.

777
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,800
Okay. I don't need you to be sorry.

778
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,500
Okay. I
don't need--

779
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,800
All--all right. All
ri-- I don't need you.

780
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,800
The ties that bind us

781
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,400
Are sometimes impossible to explain.

782
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:44,600
They connect us

783
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:48,200
Even after it seems like
the ties should be broken.

784
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,300
Some bonds defy distance...

785
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,600
And time... And logic...

786
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,500
Oh, god. I...

787
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:13,000
I said good-bye. I b--
I burned the sweater.

788
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,700
Yeah, thanks for that, by the way.

789
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:18,100
I love that sweater.
You made me that sweater.

790
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,100
Oh, my god. Oh,
my god. Izzie--

791
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,900
Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh,
my god. Stop freaking out.

792
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,900
You're not real. You're
not real. Hey, I told you...

793
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,600
You're not real. You are
not real. I'm here for you.

794
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,600
You are not real. You are not real.

795
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,900
You are not real.

796
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,700
Izzie, look at me.

797
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,100
Touch me.

798
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,500
You see?

799
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,000
I told you I was real.

800
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:20,600
Oh, god. Hey.

801
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,800
Because some ties are simply...

802
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,000
Meant to be.
