1
00:00:10,655 --> 00:00:14,955
my mother called it the greatest and
most terrifying moment in her life.

2
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:23,125
he said "karev.

3
00:00:23,255 --> 00:00:25,595
" Standing at the head
of the surgical table,

4
00:00:25,805 --> 00:00:29,115
knowing that a patient's life
depends on you and you alone...

5
00:00:29,255 --> 00:00:31,125
-he said "karev.
-" Yes!

6
00:00:31,385 --> 00:00:32,975
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

7
00:00:32,995 --> 00:00:34,685
You're "sure" sure?

8
00:00:41,235 --> 00:00:43,315
It's what we all dream about.

9
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:51,975
Because the rst person that
gets to fly solo in the O.R.?

10
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:54,205
Kind of a badass.

11
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:00,955
stevens! He said "stevens.

12
00:01:01,015 --> 00:01:03,295
" Well,which is
it,moron,stevens or karev?

13
00:01:03,455 --> 00:01:07,035
This is stupid. You guys are gonna trust these
imbeciles to tell you who's getting the solo surgery?

14
00:01:07,045 --> 00:01:10,055
Is this hard for you,being
banned from the solo surgery?

15
00:01:10,225 --> 00:01:12,445
It must be really hard for you.

16
00:01:12,445 --> 00:01:14,135
Ooh,a mean streak. I like it.

17
00:01:14,165 --> 00:01:16,665
He may change his mind. He's
been known to change his mind.

18
00:01:16,665 --> 00:01:17,965
Please don't do that.

19
00:01:17,965 --> 00:01:20,465
You guys go ahead and,uh,will
yourselves to be voted in.

20
00:01:20,515 --> 00:01:21,765
Use "the secret.

21
00:01:22,105 --> 00:01:24,905
" Grey! Uh,the chief said "grey.

22
00:01:26,074 --> 00:01:27,744
" What? Come on. This is bogus.

23
00:01:27,764 --> 00:01:29,224
You're just figuring that out?

24
00:01:29,384 --> 00:01:31,194
Steve is not a lip-reader.

25
00:01:31,304 --> 00:01:33,294
None of the interns are lip-readers.

26
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:38,444
You just have to wait for the attendings
to vote just like we did when I won.

27
00:01:38,614 --> 00:01:40,674
You won your solo surgery?

28
00:01:40,904 --> 00:01:43,074
I'm just gonna pretend you didn't feel
the need to ask me that question,yang.

29
00:01:43,214 --> 00:01:45,804
Of course I won. I was good.

30
00:01:45,944 --> 00:01:47,714
I didn't cut l-vad wires...

31
00:01:47,754 --> 00:01:53,504
or put my hand in bomb-y body cavities or
have my interns operating on themselves.

32
00:01:53,544 --> 00:01:55,074
I was special.

33
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:58,614
I was young,gifted and
black,and everybody knew it.

34
00:01:58,754 --> 00:02:00,954
The attendings knew
it. The chief knew it.

35
00:02:01,034 --> 00:02:04,694
I didn't have to act
like I could read lips.

36
00:02:04,804 --> 00:02:09,714
Just go about my work calmly,and
waited for my name to get called.

37
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:11,934
okay. It's done.

38
00:02:12,744 --> 00:02:14,864
Oh,whatever,helen keller.

39
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:16,714
No,I'm serious.

40
00:02:16,774 --> 00:02:18,824
The chief sent me.
They made their choice.

41
00:02:18,894 --> 00:02:20,424
Who is it?

42
00:02:27,734 --> 00:02:29,574
It's you.

Season 5 Episode 10</font>

46
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:41,790
I am happy to announce that the first
solo surgery will take place tonight--

47
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,730
a below-the-knee
amputation,bone cancer.

48
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,150
-Poor bastard.
-Mr. Collinsworth in 2212.

49
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,300
No appy?

50
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,850
Saw action. Sweet.

51
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:54,040
Choosing who gets the first solo surgery isn't
just about who has the best surgical skills

52
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,040
or who's logged the
most hours in the O.R.

53
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,030
It's about the
highest form of trust--

54
00:03:00,002 --> 00:03:03,732
the trust to put a patient's life
into one of our resident's hands.

55
00:03:03,902 --> 00:03:09,902
And for the first time that I can recall,every
single attending picked the same person.

56
00:03:10,122 --> 00:03:11,612
Dr. Yang.

57
00:03:11,922 --> 00:03:14,282
However,Dr. Yang is out of the running.

58
00:03:14,452 --> 00:03:16,322
She is going to pick the winner instead.

59
00:03:16,422 --> 00:03:20,032
Dr. Yang will post her decision
on the O.R. Board at 4:00 P.M.

60
00:03:20,102 --> 00:03:24,052
Also,since your interns are
still banned from the O.R.,

61
00:03:24,222 --> 00:03:27,162
The winner will be allowed to pick a
fellow resident to scrub in with them.

62
00:03:27,172 --> 00:03:28,592
Good luck.

63
00:03:29,992 --> 00:03:31,972
This is torture for me.

64
00:03:32,672 --> 00:03:34,732
I'm not even done.

65
00:03:35,442 --> 00:03:37,902
-Sir?
-Dr. Dixon's back.

66
00:03:38,656 --> 00:03:42,096
You'll be spending the day
with her. You will impress her.

67
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:44,796
And you will make sure
this hospital impresses her.

68
00:03:44,966 --> 00:03:48,286
By the end of the day,I want that
woman to be my next head of cardio.

69
00:03:48,356 --> 00:03:51,356
If she's not,I'll know who to blame.

70
00:03:52,386 --> 00:03:54,846
We held a retractor
for 12 hours together.

71
00:03:54,956 --> 00:03:58,116
You said I had small hands,good
for surgery. Remember?

72
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,556
No. Go away.

73
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,746
I operated on a heart in an elevator.

74
00:04:01,766 --> 00:04:02,766
Look,that was over a year ago.

75
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:06,526
O'malley's 007. Think how poor your
decision would look if you gave it to him.

76
00:04:06,736 --> 00:04:08,046
Your turn.

77
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:10,696
I don't know why you
guys are even bothering.

78
00:04:10,756 --> 00:04:12,316
We all know who she's gonna pick.

79
00:04:12,456 --> 00:04:14,656
She's not gonna pick me
because I'm her best friend.

80
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,676
She's gonna pick me
because I'm the best.

81
00:04:16,726 --> 00:04:18,186
Okay,stop.

82
00:04:18,246 --> 00:04:20,336
Are you guys kidding me?

83
00:04:22,186 --> 00:04:24,476
Fine. I'll think about it.

84
00:04:24,486 --> 00:04:27,036
Just... go and do surgical things.

85
00:04:29,664 --> 00:04:31,764
Iz,are you coming? We
gotta go to the clinic.

86
00:04:31,764 --> 00:04:33,274
Flu season fun.

87
00:04:33,534 --> 00:04:34,994
yeah.

88
00:04:35,364 --> 00:04:36,674
I...

89
00:04:36,994 --> 00:04:38,624
will catch up with you.

90
00:04:38,704 --> 00:04:40,164
-Me,too.
-Shut up.

91
00:04:42,694 --> 00:04:44,034
Not you.

92
00:04:44,544 --> 00:04:47,024
My head... shut up.

93
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:53,544
When I win,you can scrub in for me.

94
00:04:53,964 --> 00:04:56,594
A-alex,she's not... not gonna pick you.

95
00:04:56,604 --> 00:05:00,094
I'll scrub in for you,too,if you
win,which you won't,'cause I will.

96
00:05:00,924 --> 00:05:02,324
Enough.

97
00:05:02,624 --> 00:05:04,784
I-I gotta go.

98
00:05:08,364 --> 00:05:13,064
cristina still hasn't talked to
me,which is normal,except it's worse.

99
00:05:13,144 --> 00:05:16,084
Two weeks suspension,and she hasn't
even bothered to say one mean thing.

100
00:05:16,194 --> 00:05:19,154
Karev called me a moron,which is good.

101
00:05:19,214 --> 00:05:21,004
Well,none of the
residents even look at me.

102
00:05:21,084 --> 00:05:22,534
The least they could do is hate us.

103
00:05:22,694 --> 00:05:24,654
Well,I'm gonna get some sex.

104
00:05:24,874 --> 00:05:26,744
Sex always makes me feel better.

105
00:05:26,774 --> 00:05:28,464
Don't look at me.

106
00:05:28,534 --> 00:05:30,104
Me either.

107
00:05:30,214 --> 00:05:32,154
That makes three of us.

108
00:05:38,094 --> 00:05:39,574
Hi.

109
00:05:39,984 --> 00:05:40,974
I get it.

110
00:05:41,144 --> 00:05:44,204
I'm the one who organized a crazy
cabal of secret cutter interns.

111
00:05:44,234 --> 00:05:48,484
The thing is,I've been advised to seek
out sex as a way out of my sad predicament,

112
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:52,114
but I think I would rather
just learn today,so...

113
00:05:52,674 --> 00:05:53,854
what do you say?

114
00:05:54,024 --> 00:05:57,584
-You,me-- why are you
talking about sex to me?

115
00:05:59,101 --> 00:06:00,351
It's inappropriate. I'm your teacher.

116
00:06:00,371 --> 00:06:04,131
I have things to teach--
double board certified things.

117
00:06:04,211 --> 00:06:07,891
No,that was always--that's what I was talking
about,for--for you to teach me medicine.

118
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:10,301
The--the sex was
that-- that was a joke.

119
00:06:10,381 --> 00:06:11,951
Dr. Sloan.

120
00:06:12,051 --> 00:06:15,611
um,I heard that you're performing
a hypopharynx reconstruction today.

121
00:06:15,781 --> 00:06:17,551
-I'm gonna make a woman speak again.
-Well,let's hope.

122
00:06:17,631 --> 00:06:20,611
-I read up on the surgery
and-- you read up on my surgery?

123
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:25,061
Since it's your first time performing what I
understand to be a very cutting-edge surgery,

124
00:06:25,141 --> 00:06:27,521
I was hoping you might
need an extra set of hands.

125
00:06:27,601 --> 00:06:29,401
Fine. You can join Dr. Grey and me.

126
00:06:29,561 --> 00:06:31,851
Dr. Grey who's been
banned from the O.R.?

127
00:06:31,941 --> 00:06:36,941
She's on cappuccino duty,which,Dr.
Grey,I'm still waiting for.

128
00:06:37,111 --> 00:06:38,861
Right away. Thank you.

129
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:45,141
Dr. Virginia dixon. It says she
arrived over half an hour ago.

130
00:06:45,221 --> 00:06:46,071
Where is she?

131
00:06:46,171 --> 00:06:48,561
-Nervous?
-What? What are you doing here?

132
00:06:48,571 --> 00:06:50,961
This is the cardio wing.
Only cardio gods allowed.

133
00:06:50,971 --> 00:06:54,161
I know. I was just looking around,getting
to know other parts of the hospital.

134
00:06:54,751 --> 00:06:55,681
What else is there?

135
00:06:55,721 --> 00:06:58,391
The O.R.,The E.R. And
the place with the food.

136
00:06:58,711 --> 00:07:00,751
somebody's got a lot to learn.

137
00:07:01,481 --> 00:07:02,581
kathleen patterson.

138
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:06,481
A laryngectomy five years ago resulted
in the loss of her ability to speak.

139
00:07:06,521 --> 00:07:11,601
Kathleen's undergone several surgical attempts to restore
her voice in the pt five years, none have been successful.

140
00:07:11,661 --> 00:07:15,441
oh,oh,this time,though,this time,uh,we
have a good feeling about this.

141
00:07:15,611 --> 00:07:17,111
Righ honey?

142
00:07:19,191 --> 00:07:22,951
As discussed,I'll get the blood supply
from your arm and the cartilage...

143
00:07:24,191 --> 00:07:25,891
from your...

144
00:07:26,121 --> 00:07:27,681
uh,kathleen?

145
00:07:27,721 --> 00:07:29,751
Honey?

146
00:07:32,316 --> 00:07:33,486
honey.

147
00:07:35,206 --> 00:07:36,576
You can talk to me.

148
00:07:36,616 --> 00:07:39,486
I'll get the skin and the blood supply
from her arm and the cartilage from her nose

149
00:07:39,546 --> 00:07:43,866
to construct a makeshift speaking
tube,which will bome her new voice box.

150
00:07:43,946 --> 00:07:47,426
Now you shoulde aware there's a
chance the procedure might not work.

151
00:07:47,486 --> 00:07:48,746
He's clear on that.

152
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,806
I'm just reminding him
not to get his hopes up.

153
00:07:52,876 --> 00:07:55,226
Any other questions I can answer?

154
00:07:58,526 --> 00:08:00,866
kathleen? Honey?

155
00:08:03,026 --> 00:08:05,576
Tell me everything there
is to know about karev.

156
00:08:05,766 --> 00:08:07,226
-Why?
-I'm his intern.

157
00:08:07,256 --> 00:08:12,546
He seems cool enough at your house,though whatever he's
got going with the girl who masturbates all the time--

158
00:08:12,556 --> 00:08:16,476
I don't like to judge-- but
still,officially,I'm his intern.

159
00:08:16,506 --> 00:08:17,276
So what's his deal?

160
00:08:17,506 --> 00:08:21,116
Sadie,I can't be your friend in here. I
mean,I'm a resident,and you're an intern.

161
00:08:21,226 --> 00:08:25,286
You're gonna have to figure out how
not to piss off alex karev yourself.

162
00:08:25,306 --> 00:08:27,466
-Okay.I get it.
-Good.

163
00:08:28,786 --> 00:08:29,976
It wasn't my fault.

164
00:08:30,126 --> 00:08:32,186
I had to tell john and
tho guys where to meet us.

165
00:08:32,316 --> 00:08:34,236
I said I would do it,that
way you could drive.

166
00:08:34,346 --> 00:08:36,076
-I'm telling mom and dad.
-I'll kill you.

167
00:08:36,096 --> 00:08:37,636
Girls,you need to calm down.

168
00:08:37,746 --> 00:08:39,346
-Tell her!
-Shut up!

169
00:08:39,406 --> 00:08:41,956
-what happened?
-Sists,16 and 15,crashed their dad's car,

170
00:08:41,956 --> 00:08:44,156
and that's all we know since they
won't stop screaming at each other.

171
00:08:44,336 --> 00:08:45,346
We need your names,now.

172
00:08:45,516 --> 00:08:47,166
Don't tell her. Don't you say a word.

173
00:08:47,206 --> 00:08:52,126
Her name is holly anderson. She was
driving and texting while driving.

174
00:08:52,176 --> 00:08:54,126
Is there a police officer here?
I would like to press charges.

175
00:08:54,136 --> 00:08:56,376
Oh,you suck-up! You
suck-up ass face!

176
00:08:56,876 --> 00:08:58,726
We need your number so
we can call your parents.

177
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:00,876
Here. I speed-dialed my dad.

178
00:09:00,956 --> 00:09:02,946
-You're such a bitch.
-No,you are.

179
00:09:03,026 --> 00:09:04,246
-No wonder all the boys in school hate you.
-make it stop.

180
00:09:04,466 --> 00:09:05,806
shut up!

181
00:09:12,434 --> 00:09:14,514
You are so dead when mom and dad show up.

182
00:09:14,624 --> 00:09:16,314
The doctors are just gonna
have to save you again.

183
00:09:16,364 --> 00:09:17,944
-I hate you.
-I hate you more.

184
00:09:18,004 --> 00:09:19,604
I hate you both.

185
00:09:31,754 --> 00:09:35,584
I know you still see me as
007,but that was day one.

186
00:09:35,694 --> 00:09:38,294
I've grown a lot since
then and learned a lot.

187
00:09:38,464 --> 00:09:40,004
You know,anyone can...

188
00:09:40,054 --> 00:09:43,754
can have brains or anyone can
have talent,but the key is to grow.

189
00:09:43,774 --> 00:09:47,464
So sure,I had a rough start and I
had to redo some of my intern year,

190
00:09:47,624 --> 00:09:53,104
but,you know,I came out the
other side,smarter,better.

191
00:09:53,274 --> 00:09:58,154
The important point is I never
gave up,because I'm a fighter.

192
00:10:03,944 --> 00:10:05,344
thank you.

193
00:10:15,393 --> 00:10:18,333
Okay,emma,I'm gonna have to check your
x-rays,but I think your leg's broken.

194
00:10:18,373 --> 00:10:19,723
You're gonna be off it for a while.

195
00:10:19,803 --> 00:10:21,913
No. No!

196
00:10:22,563 --> 00:10:25,333
I can't miss my future
leaders of america conference.

197
00:10:25,423 --> 00:10:28,153
-Holly!
-Emma,I'm gonna be grounded till graduation.

198
00:10:28,183 --> 00:10:29,723
I was going to D.C.

199
00:10:29,743 --> 00:10:31,543
I've been waiting for this for a year.

200
00:10:31,593 --> 00:10:35,283
Mom and dad spent 2 grand.
No,they've now wasted 2 grand.

201
00:10:35,363 --> 00:10:38,123
-God,you stupid baby!
-Hey,all right.You know,I'm separating you two.

202
00:10:41,633 --> 00:10:43,733
listen,I've been here,lots.

203
00:10:43,923 --> 00:10:46,923
Your dad won be as pissed as you think.
He'll just be happy that you're safe.

204
00:10:46,983 --> 00:10:49,573
He'll kill me. He'll
take away everything.

205
00:10:49,893 --> 00:10:51,903
How long have her eyes been like that?

206
00:10:52,033 --> 00:10:54,073
-Her eyes? What--
page shepherd.

207
00:10:54,093 --> 00:10:56,783
Tell him she might have a basilar skull
fracture. Let's get her up to C.T.,Now.

208
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,773
-I didn't see.I'm sorry.
-You can do scut.

209
00:10:58,803 --> 00:11:01,113
I'll call you when she
needs another pep talk.

210
00:11:01,343 --> 00:11:02,883
Where is she going?

211
00:11:03,073 --> 00:11:04,943
-Just to run a few tests.
-Good!

212
00:11:05,283 --> 00:11:06,933
Get her out of here! Take her away!

213
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:08,733
I hope you die!

214
00:11:18,423 --> 00:11:19,823
oh,crap.

215
00:11:19,853 --> 00:11:21,113
Somebody's in big trouble.

216
00:11:21,253 --> 00:11:23,443
Did you forget to open it or
did you forget to staff it?

217
00:11:23,493 --> 00:11:24,863
Both.

218
00:11:24,973 --> 00:11:26,773
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,everybody.

219
00:11:26,773 --> 00:11:28,353
I will be right back with the keys.

220
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,333
Might want to get some
nurses while you're at it.

221
00:11:31,948 --> 00:11:32,758
So does this happen a lot?

222
00:11:32,928 --> 00:11:35,388
'Cause if it does,you're kinda
giving my clinic a bad name.

223
00:11:35,588 --> 00:11:36,598
You're mocking me now?

224
00:11:36,768 --> 00:11:38,948
Sweet. Very sweet.

225
00:11:45,098 --> 00:11:47,648
Dr. Dixon,there you are. I'm Dr. Yang.

226
00:11:48,878 --> 00:11:49,878
Great.

227
00:11:50,058 --> 00:11:51,718
Well,I've been assigned
to work with you today.

228
00:11:51,868 --> 00:11:54,968
I was in the cardio lab looking for
you. I'm so sorry it took me so long.

229
00:11:55,038 --> 00:11:58,988
There's a blank spot on this board.
There's a surgery but no surgeon.

230
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:01,268
I would like to do a
surgery,but it's an amputation.

231
00:12:01,398 --> 00:12:05,238
I haven't done an amputation
since my residency.

232
00:12:09,018 --> 00:12:10,188
well,um...

233
00:12:11,468 --> 00:12:12,418
that'S...

234
00:12:12,808 --> 00:12:14,308
it's really hard to...

235
00:12:14,508 --> 00:12:15,508
um,that...

236
00:12:15,678 --> 00:12:20,508
is your stuttering pathological and persistent
or is it occasional and stress related?

237
00:12:20,578 --> 00:12:22,458
I don'T... stutter.

238
00:12:22,528 --> 00:12:24,818
I had persistent pathological
stuttering as a child,

239
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,698
but it can be treated with
rigorous speech therapy.

240
00:12:29,628 --> 00:12:31,268
Yes,ma'am. Thank you.

241
00:12:33,578 --> 00:12:36,128
Why is this slot on the board blank?

242
00:12:36,368 --> 00:12:39,738
I need to select one of my
fellow residents for that slot.

243
00:12:39,878 --> 00:12:41,948
It's the first solo surgery of my class.

244
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:45,048
The chief asked you to
choose from your peers?

245
00:12:45,318 --> 00:12:46,908
Yes,ma'am.

246
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,330
Mr. Patterson.

247
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,230
I have some forms for your wife
to fill out. Is now a good time?

248
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:07,110
She's a blogger... about
cancer and voicelessness.

249
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,960
She's famous in certain
internet circles.

250
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:12,790
Well,it seems like you two have
a-a pretty great system going here.

251
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,710
I--you've learned
to comnicate.

252
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,120
Oh,you mean the post-its?

253
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,140
You think that's a pretty great system?

254
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:24,010
I--it'S...
convenient.

255
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:27,310
"Yes,no,hello,I love you"...

256
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:32,210
you read the words long enough,they
begin to lose their meaning.

257
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,350
Mid-shaft transverse tibia fracture?

258
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,650
Hi. Sorry to barge in.

259
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:44,070
I was,uh,I was just walking by,and I
saw broken bones,and I love broken bones.

260
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,300
Less than 5 degrees of angulation,right?

261
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,420
Yeah. It,uh...

262
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:51,600
uh,we can treat it with...

263
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,090
closed reduction and casting.

264
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:57,300
Flexion-extension views
of the cervical spine?

265
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,480
Yes.

266
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,340
uh,I-I sh--I should
go see my patient.

267
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,850
that's a chair.

268
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,810
looks like a hemopericardium.
Let cardio know.

269
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:16,530
Hey,I've got a future leader
outside. She needs a C.T.

270
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,110
oh,I'm not mad at you
for not ting for me.

271
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,760
It would've looked like
you were playing favorites.

272
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:25,290
Good.You deserve it. Cristina knows
that,even you two are fighting.

273
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,200
you and yang are fighting?

274
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,440
We're not fighting.
Fought--past tense.

275
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,310
How bad is it? Real bad?

276
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,900
she's crashing.

277
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:42,570
there's brain matter in the blood. Let
an O.R. Know we're coming and page cardio.

278
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,120
what happened to her?

279
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,470
Holly?

280
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,110
Holly?

281
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,720
holly?

282
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,230
What did you do to my sister? Holly!

283
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,430
Holly! What did you do to her?

284
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,120
So... you know I deserve this.

285
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,590
You know I'm the most qualified.

286
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,850
But I don't want it to be a
big,awkward thing. I don'T.

287
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,830
So just,you know,you
do what you have to do.

288
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,620
Okay.

289
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,540
Okay.

290
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:22,450
I'll see you later.

291
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:27,540
we're almost done here,emma.

292
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,520
Holly,will be all right,right?

293
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:30,900
She's gonna be okay?

294
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,700
Well,she got into surgery
very quick,so that's good.

295
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:36,300
-Are my parents here yet?
-They're--they're coming.

296
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:38,290
-Your dad's-- but holly is
gonna be all right,right?

297
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:41,920
Uh,she's not in--in,like--
she won't die?

298
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,590
Emma,you didn't mean it.

299
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,450
I said,"I hope you die.

300
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:48,710
" That can't be the last thing
she heard me say. It can'T.

301
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:51,600
Just don't let her die, please.

302
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,050
All right,I'll go to the O.R.
And get an update for you.

303
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,080
-Okay.
-Okay.

304
00:16:05,015 --> 00:16:06,955
be objective,. Yang.

305
00:16:07,075 --> 00:16:11,005
Consider accomplishments,achievements,look
for the standouts.

306
00:16:11,265 --> 00:16:16,785
Right now,let's see what kind of standout Dr. Karev
proves himself to be when I ask him to sew the graft.

307
00:16:17,115 --> 00:16:18,835
-Really?
-Absolutely.

308
00:16:18,885 --> 00:16:23,065
Dr. Yang,watch karev to see if his
skills are up to par for the solo.

309
00:16:23,225 --> 00:16:25,195
A system. Devise a system.

310
00:16:25,265 --> 00:16:27,345
Rank everyone accordingly. That's all.

311
00:16:27,735 --> 00:16:29,325
Thank you.

312
00:16:33,135 --> 00:16:34,665
out of the way. What just happened?

313
00:16:34,715 --> 00:16:35,515
Her brain is changing color.

314
00:16:35,555 --> 00:16:36,845
get outta the way. Get outta
the way. She's hemorrhaging.

315
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:38,625
-Push 100 of mannitol.
-What did I do?

316
00:16:39,315 --> 00:16:40,745
What did I do?

317
00:16:42,655 --> 00:16:44,795
Oy,okay.So the new
intern,meredith's friend--

318
00:16:44,905 --> 00:16:46,535
-the psycho with no appendix?
-Yeah.

319
00:16:46,545 --> 00:16:47,215
We talked.

320
00:16:47,295 --> 00:16:50,555
I mean,she came and talked to me,but it
was,like--it was more than that,you know?

321
00:16:50,695 --> 00:16:52,505
A guy looks at you a
certain way,you know,

322
00:16:52,675 --> 00:16:54,625
his eyes wander when he talks
to you,and bang,you just know.

323
00:16:54,705 --> 00:16:56,335
But this whole girl
thing,it's so confusing.

324
00:16:56,345 --> 00:16:58,215
-Well,was there touching?
-No.

325
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,195
-Was there playing with the hair?
-No.

326
00:17:00,255 --> 00:17:03,845
-Was there licking of the lips?
-Oh,my god.

327
00:17:03,965 --> 00:17:05,185
I made it up.

328
00:17:05,215 --> 00:17:09,525
I made it up because I'm lonely and depressed and
desperate for attention from the hot new intern.

329
00:17:09,585 --> 00:17:10,545
Crazy new intern.

330
00:17:10,575 --> 00:17:12,605
-Crazy,hot--
no!

331
00:17:13,385 --> 00:17:17,925
The hot ones are the ones that cause trouble the ones
that distract you from realizing your true potential.

332
00:17:18,065 --> 00:17:19,945
You need to focus on the medicine.

333
00:17:20,015 --> 00:17:22,715
Take all that pent up sexual energy
you'd waste thinking about hot,

334
00:17:22,735 --> 00:17:26,995
young,naked available interns,and
put it back into your genius...

335
00:17:27,075 --> 00:17:28,815
-right.
-Your godliness.

336
00:17:29,655 --> 00:17:31,315
Build someone an organ.

337
00:17:31,645 --> 00:17:32,595
That's hot.

338
00:17:32,745 --> 00:17:33,945
She smiled. Did I mention she smiled?

339
00:17:34,025 --> 00:17:36,295
No hot interns!

340
00:17:37,995 --> 00:17:44,065
and then we'll insert the newly constructed
tube in between her trachea and esophagus just...

341
00:17:44,245 --> 00:17:45,375
like...

342
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:46,585
that.

343
00:17:46,755 --> 00:17:49,505
So this valve right here flips open
when she has air in the trachea--

344
00:17:49,525 --> 00:17:51,475
you're in my space.Back up.

345
00:17:51,565 --> 00:17:53,375
Just back the hell up.

346
00:17:54,969 --> 00:17:58,569
Dr. Bailey,will you please find Dr. Grey
something to do other than interfere?

347
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:02,419
Uh,Dr. Grey,finish prepping
Mrs. Patterson for surgery.

348
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,179
She was in my space.

349
00:18:11,859 --> 00:18:14,159
George,can you cover for
me for a little while?

350
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:15,099
Where are you going? We're swamped.

351
00:18:15,149 --> 00:18:18,069
Uh,there's something that I
need to do. It pressing,okay?

352
00:18:18,649 --> 00:18:20,769
It's the hot sex. She doesn't want
to miss out on the hot,hot sex.

353
00:18:20,829 --> 00:18:22,439
-Izzie-- it's
the clinic,george.

354
00:18:22,449 --> 00:18:24,209
You can handle the clinic.

355
00:18:25,879 --> 00:18:28,809
You're lucky she even showed up.
She hasn't been here all week.

356
00:18:31,299 --> 00:18:33,239
-Dr. Shepherd--
it wasn't you.

357
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,319
She had a carotid dissection.
Nothing you could've done.

358
00:18:37,389 --> 00:18:39,599
-So we can't just--
she had a massive C.V.A.

359
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:42,589
The blood supply to her brain was
cut off and cannot be restored.

360
00:18:42,609 --> 00:18:46,529
So even though Dr. Shepherd was able
to fix the hole in her brain that

361
00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:48,989
allowed the brain tissue
to leak through her nose,

362
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:53,919
the subsequent carotid dissection has
caused loss of her cerebral function.

363
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:55,589
You do understand that?

364
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,669
She's brain dead. I get it.

365
00:19:02,879 --> 00:19:04,929
she's only 16.

366
00:19:09,879 --> 00:19:11,319
that's good news.

367
00:19:11,489 --> 00:19:13,629
She'll be an excellent
candidate for organ donation.

368
00:19:13,739 --> 00:19:16,649
Excellent candidate.
Excellent organs.Young.

369
00:19:28,215 --> 00:19:29,405
dude...

370
00:19:30,165 --> 00:19:31,695
you were robbed.

371
00:19:31,865 --> 00:19:33,185
You got screwed by politics.

372
00:19:33,355 --> 00:19:35,915
The chief,he needed a
scapegoat. It's so unfair.

373
00:19:38,025 --> 00:19:39,215
I'm sorry.

374
00:19:39,285 --> 00:19:42,725
I-I can't do this. I-I-I can kiss
ass when I have to,but not yours.

375
00:19:43,605 --> 00:19:46,935
below-the-knee amputation-- make a transverse
incision at the mid-shaft of the tibia,

376
00:19:47,105 --> 00:19:49,675
elevate the peosteum and cut the
tibia and fibula with a bone saw,

377
00:19:49,765 --> 00:19:51,995
ligate the vascular bundles
and release the tourniquet.

378
00:19:52,075 --> 00:19:55,015
I've done four of 'em-- one
on a cadaver,three on stan.

379
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:01,535
you know who you're gonna pick?

380
00:20:01,725 --> 00:20:04,185
Well,I'm ranking them
according to a system.

381
00:20:04,295 --> 00:20:08,695
You know,surgical skills,hours in the O.R.
Published papers,academic accomplishments--

382
00:20:08,865 --> 00:20:12,155
you know them. You know their
capabilities. Go with your gut.

383
00:20:12,335 --> 00:20:13,505
My gut?

384
00:20:13,715 --> 00:20:17,425
I'm not putting a patient's life in the
hands of a novice surgeon based on my gut.

385
00:20:17,945 --> 00:20:20,885
-well,it worked for me.
-your gut?

386
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:23,825
It's what told me to choose you.

387
00:20:32,185 --> 00:20:34,865
-Beautiful.
-what?

388
00:20:35,065 --> 00:20:36,895
Your necklace.

389
00:20:37,935 --> 00:20:39,165
right.

390
00:20:42,545 --> 00:20:44,125
I have to go.

391
00:20:44,575 --> 00:20:46,035
See ya.

392
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:54,729
I hope you didn't page me to help you pass
out cough drops,'cause it ain't gonna happen.

393
00:20:54,829 --> 00:20:55,499
Where's izzie?

394
00:20:55,499 --> 00:20:57,209
How should I know?I
thought she was here.

395
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:58,909
She's avoiding me.She
won't answer my pages.

396
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:00,259
So what do you want me to do about it?

397
00:21:00,379 --> 00:21:01,589
Well,you guys are together now,right?

398
00:21:01,709 --> 00:21:04,719
So why don't you talk to her and find out why
she couldn't care less about her own clinic?

399
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:08,069
You're just pissed she's not here 'cause
you can't handle a few cases of the flu.

400
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,109
Something's wrong,alex.

401
00:21:10,639 --> 00:21:12,569
You need to talk to
her.She won't talk to me.

402
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:15,119
Don't ever talk to me about izzie again.

403
00:21:19,769 --> 00:21:21,559
it's just george.

404
00:21:21,899 --> 00:21:26,769
Your friends,though,you know,they're out there
fight for a chance to chop off that guy's leg.

405
00:21:26,859 --> 00:21:28,639
Wh-what is that anyw?

406
00:21:28,739 --> 00:21:31,569
It's how we learn,by doing.

407
00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:36,319
And I lost my shot at the solo surgery as
soon as the chief made it cristina's decision.

408
00:21:38,609 --> 00:21:41,359
anyway,there will always be surgeries.

409
00:21:41,439 --> 00:21:44,289
There won't always be fianc
who come back from the dead.

410
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,149
Good point.

411
00:21:51,379 --> 00:21:56,169
aren't you going to deepithelialize
here to connect it to the trachea?

412
00:21:56,939 --> 00:22:01,239
You're a very eager student,Dr.
Bailey,very thorough.

413
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:03,719
Any way I can be of service.

414
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:12,869
I'm not sorry.

415
00:22:13,379 --> 00:22:14,609
What?

416
00:22:14,739 --> 00:22:16,379
For what we did.

417
00:22:16,539 --> 00:22:19,069
It was extreme,maybe even
stupid,but this program?

418
00:22:19,179 --> 00:22:21,449
I mean,you should be down in that
O.R. Not up here in t nosebleeds,

419
00:22:21,449 --> 00:22:26,969
and I shouldn't be spending my entire day transcribing
all of karev's charts because his handwriting's illegible.

420
00:22:27,069 --> 00:22:28,719
I mean,how is that teaching?

421
00:22:28,869 --> 00:22:31,689
So they can call me crazy sadie
and god knows what oth names,

422
00:22:31,779 --> 00:22:34,489
but that doesn't change the
fact that this program is broken.

423
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:38,489
I mean,the only time they ever bother with
us is if they think they can get us in bed.

424
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:41,359
That's not true.

425
00:22:41,479 --> 00:22:45,059
Dr. Sloan took the time to teach
me today,and that was not about sex.

426
00:22:45,129 --> 00:22:46,529
he likes you.

427
00:22:46,729 --> 00:22:47,939
Who?Dr. Sloan?

428
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:50,339
Oh,don't tell me you haven't
noticed his eyes on your ass.

429
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:52,289
You are delusional.

430
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:55,509
Is he cutting into her throat?

431
00:22:56,239 --> 00:22:58,219
Bloody hell.

432
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:08,039
so I suppose you'll use a strip test
to confirm flow across the anastomosis?

433
00:23:08,129 --> 00:23:10,419
That can damage the endothelium.

434
00:23:10,829 --> 00:23:12,399
Oh,but don't you
need to confirm--

435
00:23:12,529 --> 00:23:15,519
Dr. Bailey,would you rather do
Mrs. Patterson's surgery yourself?

436
00:23:15,739 --> 00:23:19,339
- I can leave.- Dr.
Sloan,I w-- I wasn'T...

437
00:23:19,449 --> 00:23:22,869
questioning your surgical skills.I
was just trying to learn...

438
00:23:23,009 --> 00:23:26,259
something exciting,something new.

439
00:23:26,259 --> 00:23:30,469
I mean,these residents are running around fighting
tooth and nail for a chance to get to cut off a leg.

440
00:23:30,899 --> 00:23:32,029
And...look what you've done here.

441
00:23:32,139 --> 00:23:38,179
You've--you've made something where
there was nothing,and it's thrilling.

442
00:23:39,639 --> 00:23:41,809
I-I was just trying to learn.

443
00:23:43,469 --> 00:23:45,699
Thank you,Dr. Bailey.

444
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,879
Now would you take the flap veins and
join them to the internal jugular,please?

445
00:23:53,939 --> 00:23:55,599
Excuse me.

446
00:24:02,269 --> 00:24:04,219
She looks like she's sleeping.

447
00:24:04,299 --> 00:24:06,289
Can I touch her?

448
00:24:06,409 --> 00:24:08,559
Yes,of course.

449
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:15,349
Can she hear me?

450
00:24:16,629 --> 00:24:19,159
She can come out of it,right...

451
00:24:19,269 --> 00:24:21,939
the coma?People can do that?

452
00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:23,449
no,she can'T.

453
00:24:24,894 --> 00:24:29,284
I'm very sorry for your loss,but tests confirm that
although your sister's bodily functions are fine,

454
00:24:29,394 --> 00:24:34,174
her brain is dead.She has no
thoughts,no emotions,no senses.

455
00:24:34,224 --> 00:24:36,084
I'm Dr. Dixon.

456
00:24:36,194 --> 00:24:40,824
I will be harvesting your sister's
organs if your parents agree.

457
00:24:40,884 --> 00:24:43,634
Please,she's our baby.We need more time.

458
00:24:43,734 --> 00:24:46,784
I'm very sorry for your loss,but
her organs are young and vital.

459
00:24:46,974 --> 00:24:49,644
They could save many lives.

460
00:24:49,934 --> 00:24:51,714
Wake up,holly.

461
00:24:51,984 --> 00:24:54,384
Wake up.Come on.Wakep.Wake up.Wake up.

462
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:57,794
I'm very sorry for your loss,but
your sister can't wake up.

463
00:24:57,904 --> 00:24:59,824
Her basic functionare gone.

464
00:24:59,944 --> 00:25:05,114
Her brain is dead.Her body is alive,but
unfortunately-- unfortunately,she is dead.

465
00:25:05,354 --> 00:25:07,214
Get out!

466
00:25:07,314 --> 00:25:09,584
You cannot have her,and
you cannot take her.

467
00:25:09,704 --> 00:25:13,964
Dr. Dixon,uh,I think--
I think they understand.

468
00:25:15,204 --> 00:25:17,674
I think you should go now,please.

469
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:22,944
I have offended you,but
we are running out of time.

470
00:25:23,034 --> 00:25:25,754
get out!

471
00:25:26,814 --> 00:25:29,124
Holly!Wake up!

472
00:25:29,244 --> 00:25:33,464
Wake up,holly!Holly,wake up!

473
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:36,504
Holly,wake up,please!

474
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,630
have you ever had mind-blowing sex...

475
00:25:54,710 --> 00:26:00,850
the kind of sex that makes you want to
die,just fall on the floor and give up and die?

476
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:03,510
'Cause this sex I'm
having,it's that good.

477
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,890
It's the best sex I've ever had.

478
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:07,950
In fact,it's the best
sex anybody's ever had.

479
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:12,310
I don't know why anybody who's had this
kind of sex would do anything but have sex.

480
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,930
Izzie...

481
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:18,410
you're gonna give the solo surgery to mer,which
is typical and boring and slightly corrupt,

482
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,580
but at least I'm having,really,really...

483
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:24,440
really good sex.

484
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:30,780
Yeah,I just thought now

485
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:39,220
I know you're nervous,and it may feel a little
strange at first,but just give it a shot.

486
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,070
You haven't forgotten.

487
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,610
Come on.Youan do it.

488
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:50,990
No!No!No more!

489
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,350
No more typing!

490
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,890
No more post-its!No!

491
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,130
Ta to me.

492
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,700
Talk to me,damn it!

493
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,700
Talk to me!

494
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:06,300
Okay,maybe we should
give her a lite time.

495
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:11,520
Um,sir,maybe you should go,too.

496
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:15,600
Just go for a-a walk or a
drive.Just give her some space.

497
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:18,530
I've given her five years of space.

498
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:27,950
It was my fault.

499
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:28,730
Excuse me?

500
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:31,960
What happened,the,um,the
appy,it was--it was my fault.

501
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:36,040
I knew what I was doing,so if you want
to punish someone,punish me,not Dr. Yang.

502
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:39,640
You know who your father is,and
you know he's why you're still here.

503
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:46,310
So if I were you,I'd stop worrying about whose fault the appy
was and start firing out what I was gonna do to make up for it.

504
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:48,240
Yes,sir.

505
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,370
Thank you,sir.

506
00:27:56,988 --> 00:28:00,358
there are people dying.Right
now,there are people dying.

507
00:28:01,578 --> 00:28:02,798
It's inappropriate.

508
00:28:02,918 --> 00:28:05,898
I'm sorry.It's almost 4:00,and I have
to-- I have to make this decision.

509
00:28:06,008 --> 00:28:07,858
No,no,I'm not talking about your system.

510
00:28:07,958 --> 00:28:11,608
I approve of your system.I was
talking about the brain dead girl.

511
00:28:11,818 --> 00:28:14,848
She can't hear her sister.She
can't feel her hands.

512
00:28:14,988 --> 00:28:17,868
There are patients dying right now,and
those organs would keep them alive.

513
00:28:17,928 --> 00:28:23,148
Leave feelings out of it-- leave them out of the
science,leave them out of the decision making--

514
00:28:23,198 --> 00:28:26,828
because people are dying as we speak.

515
00:28:59,178 --> 00:29:01,128
Is she kidding?

516
00:29:01,328 --> 00:29:02,748
Congratulations.

517
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:04,628
Whatever.

518
00:29:09,568 --> 00:29:11,358
Interesting choice,yang.

519
00:29:12,228 --> 00:29:14,578
He made the best case.

520
00:29:30,884 --> 00:29:33,934
iz.I won.

521
00:29:36,034 --> 00:29:36,734
What time is it?

522
00:29:36,854 --> 00:29:39,584
yang--she picked me
for the solo surgery.

523
00:29:39,674 --> 00:29:41,194
She did?

524
00:29:41,334 --> 00:29:43,274
That's amazing.

525
00:29:43,514 --> 00:29:45,454
I love you.

526
00:29:45,724 --> 00:29:47,054
What?

527
00:29:47,214 --> 00:29:48,564
I love you.

528
00:29:48,724 --> 00:29:50,854
I friggin' love you.

529
00:29:50,934 --> 00:29:55,004
I just got the solo surgery,and the first thing
I didwas look for you,and you weren't there.

530
00:29:55,444 --> 00:29:57,454
You're never there anymore.

531
00:29:57,514 --> 00:30:01,334
And I've been thinking about it,and I-I
think it might be 'cause you love me,too,

532
00:30:01,454 --> 00:30:03,044
and 'cause you're scared of that...

533
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:06,774
and 'cause I-I screwed it up last
time and 'cause denny died and-

534
00:30:06,944 --> 00:30:09,464
- alex
- just listen.

535
00:30:09,824 --> 00:30:15,454
You had that heart patient,and it reminded you of denny and
how bad yofelt when you were lying on that bathroom floor.

536
00:30:15,704 --> 00:30:17,144
I get that.

537
00:30:17,234 --> 00:30:18,884
I get thatou're scared.

538
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:23,284
But you're not gonna have to feel like
that again,'cause I'm not gonna die,iz.

539
00:30:23,344 --> 00:30:27,754
And I'm not gonna cheat on you
and I--I'm not gonna go anywhere...

540
00:30:29,284 --> 00:30:31,314
'cause...

541
00:30:31,914 --> 00:30:34,474
I think you're my best shot at...

542
00:30:35,864 --> 00:30:39,924
I think with you,you make me better.

543
00:30:40,084 --> 00:30:41,704
You make me want to be better.

544
00:30:41,764 --> 00:30:43,914
You make me want to be good.

545
00:30:44,064 --> 00:30:48,014
And I think I can.With
you,I think I can.

546
00:30:48,144 --> 00:30:50,444
So I'm not going anywhere,and
you can stop hiding.

547
00:30:50,544 --> 00:30:52,234
And if you want to
be scared,that's okay.

548
00:30:52,334 --> 00:30:54,624
Just be scared with me.

549
00:30:54,744 --> 00:30:58,404
Be scared while you scrub in
with me for my first solo surgery.

550
00:30:58,484 --> 00:31:00,544
Okay?

551
00:31:00,674 --> 00:31:02,634
You love me.

552
00:31:02,754 --> 00:31:04,924
Shut up.

553
00:31:14,614 --> 00:31:17,834
I'm really starting
to not like that guy.

554
00:31:20,804 --> 00:31:22,554
I never should've said it.

555
00:31:22,674 --> 00:31:24,484
I didn't mean it.

556
00:31:24,964 --> 00:31:27,354
I never should've said it.

557
00:31:28,164 --> 00:31:29,824
Tell her that.

558
00:31:29,934 --> 00:31:32,004
Tell her the last thing
you'd want her to hear.

559
00:31:32,084 --> 00:31:34,144
Because you have to believe
that if it were you in this bed

560
00:31:34,214 --> 00:31:37,744
and holly was sitting with you
feeling this bad,you would forgive her.

561
00:31:38,394 --> 00:31:40,224
Tell her.

562
00:31:45,264 --> 00:31:46,994
I'm sorry.

563
00:31:49,644 --> 00:31:52,134
I'm so sorry.

564
00:31:56,824 --> 00:31:58,724
I love you.

565
00:32:00,854 --> 00:32:02,934
she loved you,too.

566
00:32:03,284 --> 00:32:07,424
No matter what you said,no matter
what happened between the two of you,

567
00:32:08,244 --> 00:32:12,234
she loved you.She loves you.

568
00:32:13,144 --> 00:32:15,334
She loves you.

569
00:32:43,574 --> 00:32:44,664
so you were...

570
00:32:44,774 --> 00:32:46,034
right.

571
00:32:46,154 --> 00:32:48,244
Cristina and I are fighting.

572
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:50,734
You should go,talk to her.

573
00:32:52,284 --> 00:32:53,814
She's your best friend.

574
00:32:53,904 --> 00:32:56,094
It's important.

575
00:32:57,204 --> 00:32:59,364
Derek?

576
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,840
They don't tell you when you become
a doctor it's gonna be like this.

577
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:13,370
They don't tell you that you're
gonna...lose more patients than you save.

578
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,720
16.

579
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,550
I'm sick of the death.

580
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:25,270
I'm sorry.

581
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:28,120
- I'll see you at home.
- Okay.

582
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:43,100
It's okay.

583
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,120
Nobody else is here.'S just
me,and I'm just an intern.

584
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,580
I'm nobody.

585
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,310
So you can try.And--and if
it doesn't work,it's okay.

586
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:53,740
Just--just
try.

587
00:34:58,594 --> 00:35:00,164
Dr. Dixon.

588
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,704
How has your day been?

589
00:35:01,804 --> 00:35:03,934
You feel like you may have
a home here at seattle grace?

590
00:35:03,994 --> 00:35:06,054
Dr. Yang-- you
tortured her today.

591
00:35:06,164 --> 00:35:10,604
Making her choose among her peers,some kind
of emotional torture,was that your intention?

592
00:35:12,964 --> 00:35:14,644
Uh,yes.

593
00:35:18,634 --> 00:35:21,054
Have your board make me a better offer.

594
00:35:35,704 --> 00:35:38,314
We're fighting,and I don't want to be.

595
00:35:38,504 --> 00:35:40,314
Let's just put this past us.

596
00:35:40,394 --> 00:35:43,634
What happened with the chief
and e interns,it doesn't matter.

597
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:48,714
I know that's why you didn't choose me,and I know
that's why you made it personal,so let's just move on.

598
00:35:49,074 --> 00:35:51,044
You made it personal.

599
00:35:51,164 --> 00:35:53,264
This,right here,is
you making it personal.

600
00:35:53,354 --> 00:35:56,444
You told me to do what i
had to do,so I chose alex.

601
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:58,324
He was the most prepared.

602
00:35:58,434 --> 00:36:03,004
That's why I didn't choose you-- not
because we're fighting,but because...

603
00:36:03,144 --> 00:36:07,214
unlike you,I can separate
my personal life from my job.

604
00:36:07,564 --> 00:36:09,744
You made it personal.

605
00:36:22,974 --> 00:36:24,474
none of you said anything.

606
00:36:24,624 --> 00:36:26,944
Those were alour interns.

607
00:36:28,164 --> 00:36:30,174
But I won this.

608
00:36:30,224 --> 00:36:32,174
They picked me.

609
00:36:32,244 --> 00:36:35,134
If I don't deserve this solo
surgery,then none of us do.

610
00:36:44,344 --> 00:36:47,694
I don't know if I'm more jealous
of alex or worried about izzie.

611
00:36:51,554 --> 00:36:54,314
I think there's something
wrong with her,mer.

612
00:36:54,444 --> 00:36:57,434
There's something wrong
with all of us,george.

613
00:36:59,204 --> 00:37:01,264
that's alex.

614
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:10,832
Not here.

615
00:37:12,642 --> 00:37:15,212
Here.

616
00:37:21,202 --> 00:37:22,772
You paged?

617
00:37:22,922 --> 00:37:24,372
Yeah.I need you to scrub in with me.

618
00:37:24,482 --> 00:37:26,402
- Where's izzie?
- I'm freakin' out.

619
00:37:26,582 --> 00:37:28,082
I'm freakin' out.

620
00:37:28,202 --> 00:37:29,562
I told her I love her.

621
00:37:29,672 --> 00:37:32,302
I told her I love her
before a solo surgery.

622
00:37:32,452 --> 00:37:33,952
I can't believe that.Who does that?

623
00:37:34,032 --> 00:37:35,832
And now she's not gonna
show up,and I'm freakin' out.

624
00:37:35,952 --> 00:37:37,452
Stop.Stop freaking out.

625
00:37:37,532 --> 00:37:40,872
If you screw this up and kill
this guy,I'm gonna be pissed.

626
00:37:41,002 --> 00:37:42,752
Then I'll know I should've won it.

627
00:37:42,782 --> 00:37:45,372
you have to kick ass in there,alex.

628
00:37:45,682 --> 00:37:47,592
You have no choice.

629
00:37:48,742 --> 00:37:51,072
Big night,karev.You ready?

630
00:37:54,812 --> 00:37:56,972
You ready?

631
00:37:57,512 --> 00:37:59,182
He's ready.

632
00:38:08,842 --> 00:38:09,492
Where are we going?

633
00:38:09,652 --> 00:38:11,972
Don't worry.You'll like it.

634
00:38:12,452 --> 00:38:14,132
Come on.

635
00:38:19,586 --> 00:38:22,166
wait.Just wait.

636
00:38:22,276 --> 00:38:24,386
Wait.

637
00:38:37,436 --> 00:38:39,046
it's the vent.

638
00:38:39,246 --> 00:38:42,136
It clears your head.It
feels better,right?

639
00:38:42,336 --> 00:38:44,306
yes.Yeah.

640
00:38:44,916 --> 00:38:47,266
It's out of time,out of space.

641
00:38:47,596 --> 00:38:49,796
Anything can happen in the vent.

642
00:38:49,896 --> 00:38:51,976
Anything.

643
00:38:52,066 --> 00:38:54,846
Likehat?

644
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:57,176
Just wait.

645
00:39:18,936 --> 00:39:20,486
you made her speak.

646
00:39:20,596 --> 00:39:22,596
Mrs. Patterson-- she
said "hi." She spoke.

647
00:39:22,686 --> 00:39:25,196
You--you made
her speak.

648
00:39:30,116 --> 00:39:31,746
I respect you.

649
00:39:31,876 --> 00:39:33,056
As a man...

650
00:39:33,176 --> 00:39:37,166
a-as a surgeon,as a
teacher,I respect you.

651
00:39:37,306 --> 00:39:39,116
So...

652
00:39:39,226 --> 00:39:41,226
teach me.

653
00:39:42,466 --> 00:39:44,276
What are you doing?Don't do that.

654
00:39:44,386 --> 00:39:45,156
Stop.

655
00:39:45,246 --> 00:39:47,216
Teach me.

656
00:39:49,656 --> 00:39:50,896
Stop.

657
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:52,436
- Teach me.
- We can't do this.

658
00:39:52,586 --> 00:39:56,606
You're little grey,and--and--and
I promised,and I'm your teacher.

659
00:39:56,776 --> 00:39:58,456
So...

660
00:39:58,626 --> 00:40:00,876
- teach me.
- Ah,lexie...

661
00:40:01,516 --> 00:40:03,346
teach me.

662
00:40:05,996 --> 00:40:07,426
Teach me.

663
00:40:12,366 --> 00:40:15,086
Come on.Am I really so bad

664
00:40:18,186 --> 00:40:22,126
no.I am.

665
00:40:32,287 --> 00:40:36,377
We enter the world alone
and we leave it alone.

666
00:40:37,197 --> 00:40:39,727
And everything that happens in between?

667
00:40:39,847 --> 00:40:42,517
We owe it to ourselves
to find a little company.

668
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:45,007
$50 says he calls on the
chief in the first 10 minutes.

669
00:40:45,117 --> 00:40:46,977
$100 he chokes before
they turn on the saw.

670
00:40:47,047 --> 00:40:49,677
Hey,that's one of us down there.

671
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:51,677
Show some respect.

672
00:40:51,807 --> 00:40:55,847
We need help,we need support.

673
00:41:00,367 --> 00:41:03,757
Otherwise we're in it by ourselves...

674
00:41:05,247 --> 00:41:07,617
strangers...

675
00:41:10,707 --> 00:41:12,607
cut off from each other.

676
00:41:12,717 --> 00:41:15,087
And we forget...

677
00:41:17,317 --> 00:41:19,947
just how connected we all are.

678
00:41:31,887 --> 00:41:34,597
So instead,we choose love...

679
00:41:35,257 --> 00:41:37,517
we choose life...

680
00:41:37,677 --> 00:41:39,837
and for a moment...

681
00:41:39,987 --> 00:41:44,807
we feel just a little bit less alone.

682
00:41:46,927 --> 00:41:48,687
10-blade.

683
00:41:54,567 --> 00:41:58,817
