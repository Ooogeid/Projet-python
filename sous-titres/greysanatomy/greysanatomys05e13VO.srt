1
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,770
I believe in heaven.

2
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,880
I also believe in hell.

3
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,620
I've never seen either,but
I believe they exist.

4
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,160
they have to exist...

5
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,430
because without a heaven...

6
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:01,730
without a hell...

7
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,030
we're all  just headed for limbo.

8
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:06,860
you coming?

9
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,960
If it's bad,the nurses
will come and get us.

10
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,130
DR. Grey,he's seizing.

11
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,470
Well,how about now?Now can we go?

12
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,660
Sadie...

13
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,110
go find something else to do,now.

14
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,200
That's an order.

18
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,100
why are you still here?

19
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,010
I'm here for you,izzie stevens.

20
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,930
No.No,you're not,because
I broke up with you.

21
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,520
So you are not here for me.

22
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:56,190
I'm sorry,but...you have to go.

23
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,660
I can't go.

24
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,650
- I'm here for you.
- Me,yeah,right.

25
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,290
- I am.I'm here--
stop saying that!

26
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:18,070
DR. Bailey.

27
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:22,500
I just called U.N.O.S. Jackson's officially at
the top of the list for a liver and small bowel.

28
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,640
They can't come soon enough.His
ammonia level's starting to rise.

29
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,790
I thought the shunt was
supposed to buy us 24 hours.

30
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:33,010
Isn't that what you said,that
it should give us 24 hours?

31
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,650
Melinda,we're doing
everything that we can.

32
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:40,490
I know. I-I know you are.

33
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,540
uh,excuse me.

34
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,080
Oh,my god.

35
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,130
He had a seizure.I gave him lorazepam.

36
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,630
You page shepherd?

37
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,020
I paged you.

38
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,080
- Page shepherd.
- The patient doesn't want that.

39
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,260
- Oh,really?He tell you that?
- yes.

40
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,220
Don't page him.

41
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,210
He's terribly unpleasant.

42
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:12,490
MR. Dunn is a match for your
kid who needs the transplant.

43
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,480
He's a match.

44
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,630
You probably have a brain bleed,which
is why we need to get shepherd in here.

45
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,870
DR. Bailey,he's gonna die anyway.

46
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:29,100
The boy who needs organs
I presume wants to live.

47
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,560
And me?

48
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,110
I have organs.

49
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:38,600
And I'm ready to die.

50
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,600
- DR. Sloan.
- DR. Grey.

51
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,590
After you,DR. Grey.

52
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,770
Thank you,DR. Sloan.

53
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:54,480
I know it feels wrong.

54
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,150
It feels wrong on so many
levels,I can't even count them.

55
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:01,700
But there is no case in any medical book that
tells you how to deal with this situation.

56
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,300
Well,I don't need a book.I know what
to do-- what's best for my patient.

57
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,060
I suggest you do the same.

58
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,640
- I am.
- Oh,oh,really?

59
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,170
You page shepherd yet?

60
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,730
Are you gonna page him?

61
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:20,470
I'm going to do my best to keep that beautiful
boy alive long enough to find him some organs.

62
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,320
I suggest you do everything you can to keep
your patient alive,because we're doctors,grey.

63
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:29,620
We're not executioners.

64
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,670
- don't even tell me.
- Locked.

65
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,450
People sleeping or--
why do I bother asking?

66
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,820
This is ridiculous.I need sleep.

67
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,230
oh,my god!

68
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,430
That's not a good noise.

69
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,470
- That's a bad noise.
- That's a really bad noise.

70
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,150
Oh,my god.Are you okay?

71
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,230
- No.
- It's bent in the middle.

72
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,030
I-I-I think
I broke it.

73
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,480
Get torres!

74
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,870
go!

75
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,330
you two are on jackson all day today.

76
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:32,730
He doesn't have a liver or intestines,which means
toxins are gonna build up and his braiis gonna swell.

77
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,980
We can't stop it,but we can
try like hell to slow it down.

78
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,770
- I on it,DR. Bailey.
- You don't have time for this,izzie.

79
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,440
You don't have time to
think about anyone else.

80
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:42,270
Stevens,I need a nod,a yawn
or maybe even a little burp--

81
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:46,200
something that lets me know that you're
awake and cable of keeping this boy alive.

82
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,800
Yes,I'morry.I am all yours.

83
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,470
way to listen.Thanks for that.

84
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,990
DR. Bailey.

85
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,610
- Yeah.
- How much time do we have left?

86
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,760
16 hours at the most.

87
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,650
There's a liver dialysis machine
downstairs.G.I.'S using it for a clinical trial.

88
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,180
It may give jackson a few more hours.

89
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,060
Maybe.

90
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:07,250
All right,then,uh,stevens,put in the I.C.P. Monitor
and start tracking his intracranial pressures.

91
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,360
Karev,go and get the machine.

92
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,860
What if it's already
hooked up to somebody?

93
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,670
If that somebody has more than 16
hours to live,then we'll unhook 'em.

94
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,550
I want off this case.

95
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,710
- DR. Bailey?
- Oh,god.I want off this case.

96
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,760
I want off
of-- what?

97
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,610
This little boy is gonna die,and I
just don't want to be there to see it.

98
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,620
I just don't want
to-- I can't see it.

99
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,330
I just want off.I want
off.I want off this case.

100
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,010
I want off.

101
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,300
When was the last time you slept?

102
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,960
No,no,no.I'm okay.

103
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,160
I think that you need to
get one or two hours of rest.

104
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,990
I'm--I'm
good.I'm--I'm fine.

105
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,430
Just go.

106
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,110
I'm fine.I'm good.I'm good.

107
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,780
- You're very happy.
- I am happy.

108
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,470
I'm happy to see you.

109
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,200
- You're not happy.
- Oh,I've just been here all night.

110
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:08,280
How is our resident
psychopath?Is he gone yet?

111
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:09,940
Uh,yeah,yeah,soon.

112
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,940
By the way,mom likes you.

113
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,160
she thinks you're good for me.

114
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,610
d--
oh!

115
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:33,090
DR. Torres,thank god you're her
yeah,I'm headed down to the pit.

116
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,790
- I got a 9-1-1 page.- Page
ortho if you need anything.

117
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,910
Uh,no,no,it was me.

118
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,420
I-I paged you
9-1-1 for DR. Sloan.

119
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,040
He's the emergency him-himself.

120
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,550
It's--it's
on his person.

121
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,690
- Wait,mark's hurt?
- Yes.

122
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,840
- No.
- Yes.

123
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:49,790
He's badly injured in--in a bad way that is bad for
anyone who's a man,but for DR. Sloan in particular.

124
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,640
Um,he may--he may
have broken a-a bone.

125
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,690
- A bone?
- He broke a bone.

126
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:58,780
I-I...  I broke his bone.

127
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,190
You're kidding,right?

128
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,410
cristina,I wanted to
apologize for last night.

129
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,270
It was not my intention
to arrive in that state.

130
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,830
You don't have to say anything.

131
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:26,310
As a rule,if I'm showering with a
woman,I do it without my clothes,

132
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,070
and if I get in her bed naked,I
don't pass out,and if I--

133
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,460
it's okay.

134
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,210
- It's not.
- It's not...

135
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:40,110
but,uh,you know,you don't
have to talk about it.

136
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:50,460
It's getting a little harder to breathe.

137
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,500
you can stop doing this,william.

138
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,590
you can stop at anytime.

139
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,080
I know. I know.

140
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:04,740
do you want me to page DR. Shepherd?

141
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:10,190
He's your boyfriend,isn't he? Yes.

142
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,880
I had a feeling. Yes.

143
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,390
I had a feeling.

144
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,970
The n has very good taste.

145
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:27,650
Right now,all I can
think about are lemons.

146
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,670
lemons?

147
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:42,690
When my grandfather was
dying,he said he smelled lemons.

148
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:48,310
It was all he could talk about
for three days,the smell of lemons.

149
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:54,080
I keep waiting to
smell them,and I don'T.

150
00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:01,510
Of course... he was a big liar,so...

151
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,080
are you sure you don't want
me to page DR. Shepherd?

152
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,880
- I'm sure.

153
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,840
Okay.

154
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,830
I need you to talk to the nurses.

155
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:18,780
Find out if any of their patients on
life support are o-positive or brain dead.

156
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,830
And then crossmatch those
folks against jackson prescott.

157
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,850
- The kid's running out of time.
- Okay.

158
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,640
And,o'malley,o'malley,sensitive
to their families.

159
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:30,860
We need organs for this
boy,but we can only ask.

160
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,730
We can't pressure.We can't coerce.

161
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:35,580
- Understood?
- Of course,sir.

162
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:45,290
- um,cristina.
- It's a ring.

163
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,620
It's from my mother.

164
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,100
Oh,it's--it's
from me.

165
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,000
It was my mother's,and I'm
gonna give it to meredith soon.

166
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,920
So what I'm looking for is an opinion
on whether she's gonna like the ring,

167
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,780
or I should have the-- the setting
redone to something more modern.

168
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,110
Well,it's-- that's
really not my job.

169
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:59,830
Right.Look,I know you
two arE... still fighting.

170
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,610
But isn't it about
time you wrap that up?

171
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:06,890
Look,I ask because when I propose to
her,she's gonna need somebody to freak out to.

172
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,080
She misses you... a lot.

173
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,850
You must miss her,too,right?

174
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,350
Look,I don't know what's
going on in your life,

175
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,110
but you must have inmethg you
need to freak out to her about,too.

176
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,060
I'm sorry.I think you
should ask someone else.

177
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:29,760
ms.Prescott,have you had
anything to eat today?

178
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:33,480
You should really keep your strength
up.Get a cup of coffee or some food.

179
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,660
I'll stay here with jackson.

180
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:48,420
You are like the guy who graduated from high
school and still hangs out on the football field.

181
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,480
Do you believe in heaven?

182
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:52,100
What?

183
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:54,060
Heaven.

184
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,370
I don't know.I guess.

185
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,350
Because I thought that maybe this was
heaven,getting to be here with you.

186
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,620
But now.. now I'm not so sure.

187
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:11,480
I think this... I think
this may be hell or--

188
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,900
what are you talking about?

189
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,910
- I'm here for you.
- Here for me,I know.

190
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:20,100
I got it.I hear you,a thousand times.

191
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:21,950
I chose alex.

192
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,350
I'm sorry. I am.

193
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,420
I am really sorry about that.

194
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,010
And I'm still here,all right?

195
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,800
You broke up with me,and m still here.

196
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,240
Doesn't that tell you anything?

197
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:34,200
It tells me that you're jealous,that
y don't want me to be happy.

198
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,450
You don't want me to choose alex.

199
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,850
Damn it,listen to me.

200
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,940
You can't pick alex.

201
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,200
- I'm here for you.
- Denny...

202
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:51,630
I want you to be happy,izzie. I do.

203
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,360
And I would leave if I could.

204
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:59,340
You think I want to stay here while
you tell me you want another man?

205
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:05,370
I can't go because
you won't listen to me.

206
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,030
I am here for you.

207
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:10,050
What does that even mean?

208
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,640
What does it mean?

209
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,910
You're a doctor,izzie.

210
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:17,520
Figure it out.

211
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:22,770
thank you.

212
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,950
What?

213
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,390
- DiD...
- what?

214
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,660
Nothing.

215
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,880
How's,uh,your serial killer?

216
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,230
Did you monitor him last night?

217
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,970
Yeah.

218
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,980
I got it covered.

219
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:50,480
Cristina,I said I've got it covered.

220
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:01,620
tell me you paged shepherd.

221
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,410
He wants to die.

222
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,310
- Meredith,what are you-- cristina,he's
gonna die anyway in a few days,

223
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:09,200
and if he diesere,we can donate his organs to
the 10 year old who's gonna die down the hall.

224
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:11,570
And derek won't allow it.So no,I didn't page him.

225
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,500
And I hope you won't either.

226
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,180
I know you think this is wrong.

227
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,330
Just let me do this.

228
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:23,390
Please... please... please help.

229
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,420
Help me. I...

230
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:29,040
I don't want to die.

231
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:30,560
I... I don't want to die.

232
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,460
page shepherd right now!

233
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,280
code blue,fourth floor.

234
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,310
should I thread the catheter?

235
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:41,930
I want to see the grand canyon.

236
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,000
- Make sure you can visualize it on the ul
- I want to hike it,actually.

237
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,800
I want to look out over dead man's drop.

238
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:46,350
what happens if you can't advance it?

239
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:48,620
- use the bend guidewire technique.
- Not because I'm dead.Just 'cause,you know,the view.

240
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,300
Shut up.

241
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,610
What was that?

242
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:55,170
Nothing.Should I be able
to see the needle tip?

243
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,800
Yeah,that shadow within
the lumen is the catheter.

244
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,050
Have we heard anything?

245
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:03,180
From U.N.O.S.,Have we heard anything?

246
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:04,770
I'll call them back.

247
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,430
I'd also like toee the
great wall of china.

248
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,220
You know,I did a lot of traveling in
my life,but I never made it to asia,

249
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:11,260
- and I regret that.
- Okay,.Stevens,aspirate and

250
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,380
- make sure the ports are patent.
- My point,you unbelievably stubborn woman...

251
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,880
- it's not flowing.What can you do to flush the line?
- Is that there are other things  I would like to do and see...

252
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,280
no,that's lidocaine.Are
you paying attention?

253
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,900
- I'm sorry.I grabbed the wrong syringe.
- Things that I would like to do,but I can'T.

254
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,350
I can't go to heaven or hell or to asia.

255
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,530
- I can't do anything but this...
- okay,that's still not how you do it.

256
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,180
- Until you wake up and figure it out.
- Would you just tell me already?

257
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:40,540
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

258
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,900
Why don't you take a
little break,DR. Stevens?

259
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:50,720
- You hear sloan broke his goods?
- what?

260
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,490
In that on-call room.Swear
to goD.I heard him screaming.

261
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,070
- With torres?
- Maybe.

262
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:59,510
But whoever it was,whoever rode him and
broke him,that's a girl I want on me.

263
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,540
Was it torres?

264
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,120
How should I know?I
mean,it's not my business.

265
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:06,880
It's nobody's business,and
it's defitely not yours.

266
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,710
I mean,not--not--not
that I know.

267
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,590
But if I did know who broke mark slo's penis,I
wouldn't even tell you because we're not even friends.

268
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:15,140
I mean,I took out your appendix
and almost ended my career.

269
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:17,190
That doesn't make us close.

270
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:22,950
- I want him prepped and into the O.R. In 20 minutes.
- Yes,sir.

271
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,740
you should've paged me a long time ago.

272
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,590
Better yet,when I asked you how he
was,you should've told me the truth.

273
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,110
I was following the patient's wishes.

274
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,290
The patient's wishes?He
doesn't get wishes.

275
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,450
He killed five women.

276
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,740
As much as you believe you're
right,I think I'm just as right.

277
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,690
If said something to you,there
would've been a debate.

278
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,100
He's been manipulating
you since he got here.

279
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:44,970
- He preys on young women.
- I made a decision as his doctor.

280
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,310
It was a bad decision.

281
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,470
It was the wrong decision.

282
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:53,070
You're gonna scrub in on the surgery,and you're gonna
watch while I try like hell to undo what you did.

283
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,840
his I.C.P. Is not going under 25.

284
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,410
Is the catheter occluded?

285
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:03,260
It's fine.

286
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:07,110
All right,try adjusting the height of the drip
chamber,and let's raise his bed up another 10 degrees.

287
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:09,860
- What'll that do?
- Not much.

288
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:13,050
Jackson.Jackson,you listen to mommy.

289
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,620
It is not time.

290
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,120
You do not get to go yet.

291
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:18,930
You have to stay here with me.

292
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,410
You hear me?You stay with mommy.

293
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,800
It is not time,baby.

294
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:25,570
I love you,and I need you to fight.

295
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:28,410
I need you to fight,jackson.

296
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,480
Yeah,that's a penile fracture.

297
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,870
Oh,I'm gonna kill myself.

298
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:46,020
We should operate,and
then you can kill yourself.

299
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:48,030
Oh,god. Can you do it?

300
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,340
Him? oh,no.He's a meatballer.

301
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,910
He is meticulous,and he
will keep his mouth shut.

302
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,140
I've done operations like this
before.It's not that complicated.

303
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,410
Guys run into this problem
on the battlefield,do they?

304
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,610
I don't think you and i should
talk about how guys run into this.

305
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:04,780
Uh,line up an O.R. We need to get
in fast,or you risk permanent damage.

306
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,900
Oh,god.No permanent damage,please.

307
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,370
Little grey,go away.

308
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,930
I don't want you to see me like this.

309
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,370
But I made you like this.

310
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:21,590
I'm saying please here.

311
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,900
Please.

312
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,090
talk to me,o'malley.

313
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,380
My god.

314
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,300
The guy's not a donor,and
they're about to unplug him.

315
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,030
- DR. Sheprd.
- DR. Bailey.

316
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:02,680
I need... y-you to stop.

317
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,540
I need you to put down the scalpel.

318
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:09,810
This man is trying to kill himself,and
god forgive me,I need you to let him.

319
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,130
You need to leave my O.R.,DR. Bailey.

320
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:26,770
Five days... in five
days,this man is going to die,

321
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,490
and his organs are going to go with him.

322
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:36,260
They'll be buried with his body,and they'll
rot in the ground,and that I-is a crime.

323
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:38,670
It's a crime against life.

324
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:42,150
It's only five days. That's it.

325
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:46,960
That's all we're taking from
him,and he doesn't want them anyway.

326
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,410
We took an oath,miranda.

327
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:53,340
I kn...

328
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:58,210
that.I know we took an
oath,but... right now,that oath...

329
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,730
makes no sense.It makes
no sense.It doesn'T.

330
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,180
So just stop. Just stop.

331
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,490
Don't do anything else for this man.

332
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:13,300
If I stop this surgery...

333
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:17,340
it's the same as me sticking
this scalpel into his brain.

334
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,070
Is that what you want?

335
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,370
YeS.That's what I want.

336
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:33,770
I'm sorry.What do you want?

337
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,950
I know this is excruciating.

338
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,950
But what I want...

339
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,220
what I need...

340
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
are your husband's organs--
his liver and his bowels.

341
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,530
- He's a match
for-- go away.

342
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:51,200
- I'm sorry.
- Please go away.

343
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,620
I can't take anymore.

344
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,100
He was healthy.

345
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,930
He was healthy two days ago.

346
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:02,270
He's my love.

347
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:08,240
And he put his head through a
windshield,a-and I have to unplug him.

348
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:12,350
He is the person who is supposed
to hold my hand when things go bad.

349
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,230
He is supposed to be her to help.

350
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:18,550
But he gets to go to heaven..

351
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,120
and I can't take anymore.

352
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:24,480
I can barely do this.

353
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:27,540
So please... go away.

354
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,450
I don't want anyone cutting into him.

355
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,620
Where the hell have you been?

356
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:58,130
I,uh..I had some stuff.

357
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,930
Dead-man-talking
stuff?

358
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,610
Uh,yeah.I... I don't know.

359
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:06,870
This kid is dying in front of his mom.

360
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:12,060
It's so bad,DR. Bailey-- DR.
Bailey-- can't stay in here and watch.

361
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,270
It's bad,but we're busting our asses to
save him,and you're talking to a dead guy.

362
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,880
Look,you want to do that crap
at home?Fine.But not here.

363
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,060
Here,you're a doctor.

364
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,200
I.C.P. Is still way too high.

365
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,630
I just gave him hypertonic saline.

366
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,980
When was his last lorazepam?

367
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,150
I gave him a bolus 20 minutes ago.

368
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,040
Put him on a drip with vec
and put him on a bis monitor.

369
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,030
Uh,check with U.N.O.S. Again.

370
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:41,560
whatever bailey's doing,I hope to hell
she's having better luck than we are.

371
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:48,250
He's hemorrhaging through his craniectomy.Should
I at least put in a subdural drain?

372
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:51,440
That's up to DR. Bailey.

373
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,930
DR. Bailey?

374
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,270
DR. Bailey,should I put in a drain?

375
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,530
No.

376
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,420
There's a lot of bleeding.We
should really do something soon.

377
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,940
- I am aware of that,DR. Yang.
- Sir,really soon.

378
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,110
it's your call,DR. Bailey.

379
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,890
It's up to you.

380
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,820
Am in executioner or am I a surgeon?

381
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,050
It's up to you.

382
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,430
It's your call.

383
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,860
pick up the scalpel.

384
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:05,510
he can't take his liver
with him to heaven.

385
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:07,920
He can't take his bowels or his kidneys.

386
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:12,660
His brain is gone,but those organs are
probably good because he's a young man.

387
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,940
And I know this is not what
you want to think about,

388
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:19,190
and it's more than anyone
should ever have to think about.

389
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:23,020
But he can't take his organs with him.

390
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:31,880
I heard it was this physical therapist from the
rehab floor who does this fancy yoga thing where she,

391
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:35,620
like,turns herself into a pretzel
while she's on top of a guy.

392
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,400
She quit two weeks ago.

393
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,770
I thought it was torres.

394
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:41,570
Well,whoever it was is going
down in seattle grace history.

395
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,560
Sloan is a legend.

396
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,990
Can you imagine the kind of muscle it
takes to break a m like that?I mean...

397
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:51,740
shut u just shut up about it.

398
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:54,840
You know something.

399
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:57,580
Yeah,I-I know that
it's nobody's business.

400
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:59,420
She totally knows something.

401
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,990
Did you see somebody
come out of the room?

402
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,940
- maybe it was her.
- What?

403
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:07,240
It was me,okay?

404
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,610
It was me.

405
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:11,650
I do this twist-and-shout thing
that blows most guys' minds,

406
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:16,500
and I guess I twisted a little too far
and almost took the whole thing off,okay?

407
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,770
I can feel you.

408
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,910
I can smell you.

409
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:41,220
If you're dead,how come
I can smell your skin?

410
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:45,680
So I'm thinking,maybe you're not dead.

411
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:48,950
Maybe that was the part of me that was
crazy,that part that thought you died.

412
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,800
Maybe this is the not crazy part.

413
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,910
You are still alive,right?

414
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,400
That's it.

415
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:58,110
I'm sorry,no.

416
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:02,920
Are you a ghost... or a dream or...

417
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:06,430
you're a doctor,izzie,a scientist.

418
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:10,060
- Think like a scientist.
- I am!I am.

419
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:16,240
Scientists believe what they
can see,what they can feel...

420
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,520
facts--hard
facts.

421
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,940
I slapped you.That is a fact.

422
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:27,040
I felt... your face  my hand.

423
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,590
Fact.

424
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:31,280
I can feel your breath against my skin.

425
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,720
Fact.

426
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:37,310
Izzie. Izzie,izzie.

427
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,960
what's happening?

428
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:43,090
You tell me.

429
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:46,200
I'm scared.

430
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:04,610
I.C.P. Is still going up.

431
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:07,470
- Are you hyperventilating him enough?
- His pc02 is 30.

432
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:09,210
All right,l's raise him all the way up.

433
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:12,810
Jackson,you have to hold on.Okay,baby?

434
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:15,110
- Hold on. Just hold on.
- Melinda,step back now.You're in the way.

435
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:17,400
- hang another bag of F.F.P. You need to step back.
- Hold on for mommy,okay?

436
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:20,670
Please,jackson.Please.

437
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,230
Ms. Prescott.

438
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,800
No.No,no,no,no,no,no,no,no.

439
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:26,600
- You have to let them work on him.
- No,I can't leave my son.

440
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,660
I can'T. I can't leave him.

441
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,120
- We'll be right outside.
- please. Let me stay.Please. Please.

442
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,150
You see any bleeders?

443
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,610
The field looks clear.

444
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,290
Nice work,DR. Yang.

445
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:39,860
Why don't you go ahead and close up?

446
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,420
Thank you,sir.

447
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,410
What a waste.

448
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,510
He's alive,DR. Grey.We saved a life.

449
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:48,490
That's never a waste.

450
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,540
He's just a little boy.

451
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,460
He's never had a sleepover.

452
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,570
He's never learned to ride a bike.

453
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:00,480
Melinda... melinda,listen to me.

454
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,940
Miracles happen.

455
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:04,040
Medical miracles happen every day.

456
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:06,140
People live.Even when
they shouldn't,they live.

457
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:10,600
I need to be with him.He's
never been anywhere without me.

458
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,610
he can't go alone.

459
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,990
I need to be with him.

460
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,750
No.You are here with him.

461
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:19,380
You're here for him even
though you aren't in the room.

462
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:21,950
You are.You are here for him.

463
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,040
You're...

464
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,280
I'm here  for you,izzie stevens.

465
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:30,760
- I'm here for you.
- you're not real.

466
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,310
- I told you,I'm here for you.
- You're not real.

467
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,210
You are not real.

468
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:36,680
Izzie,I told you,I'm here for you.

469
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,380
DR. Bailey says you need to come now.

470
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:58,140
it's time to hold him.

471
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:02,040
He's going,melinda.Hold
him and help him go.

472
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:22,260
It's okay,baby.

473
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:24,040
You can go.

474
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,720
It's okay.

475
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:28,080
You can go.

476
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,760
It's okay.

477
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,550
Mommy won't be mad.

478
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:35,200
You can go,jackson.

479
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:37,300
It's okay.

480
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,060
It's okay,jackson.

481
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,350
You can go.

482
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,970
We have organs.

483
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,490
We have organs!

484
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,140
Get him to O.R. Three now.

485
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,310
starting C.P.R.push .35 of epi.

486
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,500
Get me a bicarb.

Start C.P.R. Get the

493
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,120
- heaven or hell?
- Yes.

494
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,260
You're here for me.

495
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,570
- Yes.
- No.

496
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,880
You're not here for me.

00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:07,080
You're here for me.

498
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,970
You're here for me.

499
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,870
I loved you so much.

500
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:19,930
I loved you so much that when I got
to come back for you,I thought...

501
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,500
you were my heaven.

502
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:32,080
But maybe... maybe I'm your hell.

503
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:39,360
I'm sick. I'm sick,aren't I?

504
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,890
And instead of telling me...

505
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:49,010
instead of telling me to save
my life-- you son of a bitch!

506
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,120
You selfish son of a bitch.

507
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,250
I hate you!

508
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,120
- I hate you!
- I didn't know that there was a chance.

509
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,170
Miracles happen.

510
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,680
Medical miracles happen every day.

511
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:58,750
You said it!You said that!

512
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:01,410
Leave! Leave.

513
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:10,880
I can go now... because you know.

514
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,860
But it's your choice.

515
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:16,980
You get to choose.

516
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:19,950
But,iz,if I go...

517
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:23,920
I don't know... I don't
know if I can come back.

518
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:24,800
If I
go--

519
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:29,300
in the choice een betwheaven
and hell,I choose heaven.

520
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,500
I choose life.Go.

521
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,880
Get out of here!

522
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,580
Goout get of here!Go.

523
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:39,910
- I really hope this is heaven.
- Go.

524
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:48,460
What are you waiting for?

525
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,120
This.

526
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:29,990
I'm alive.

527
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:33,650
Yes,you are.

528
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:40,800
I was playing you.

529
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,690
Your boyfriend was right.

530
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:47,380
I wanted to destroy your career.

531
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,660
I was playing you the
whole time,DR. Grey.

532
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:55,560
And I wanted to be
here to see the fallout.

533
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,640
You were scared,william.

534
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,280
Death is scary.

535
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:04,540
I would've been scared,too.

536
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:17,330
it'd be good to have a
friendly face in the crowd...

537
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,240
when they kill me.

538
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:44,520
I planned a whole evening... last night.

539
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,150
A real date.

540
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:53,520
It was a clear night-- one of
the,uh,five seattle gets all year.

541
00:34:54,930 --> 00:35:00,600
I was gonna take you to the west point lighthouse,and
we were gonna watch the northern lights together.

542
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:08,450
I'd like another chance.

543
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:14,390
I want you to give me another chance.

544
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,590
You got some problems.

545
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,200
You've got some big problems.

546
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,670
Yeah. Yeah,yeah,I do.

547
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,260
Will you go out with me anyway?

548
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:40,160
Yes.

549
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,560
Please go away.

550
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:54,740
No.

551
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,370
Little grey..

552
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:59,390
it's not little grey.It's lexie.

553
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:06,630
And... I'm sorry that I-I broke
y-- I'm sorry that I hurt you.

554
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,530
And I'm sorry that you're humiliated.

555
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,380
But I'm-- I'm not
going anywhere.

556
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:16,260
I-I've got a friend who
is guarding the door--

557
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,470
a good friend-- and since no
one is going to be coming in,

558
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:24,740
I'm--I'm--I am now going to climb into bed
with you and I'm gonna stroke your hair,

559
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:29,400
because that's what I like to
have done for me when I'm hurt.

560
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:47,930
How is he?

561
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:52,110
We were so late getting those organs in.

562
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:57,760
Between the cerebral edema
and the reperfusion coding,

563
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,440
we--we don't know what kind of
damage was done to his brain.

564
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,500
We don't even know
if he's gonna wake up.

565
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:08,250
I crossed a line today.

566
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:14,630
I crossed a line.

567
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,630
So did I.

568
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:01,940
heaven...  hell.

569
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,970
Limbo...

570
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:10,560
no one really knows
where we're going...

571
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:06,190
lemons.

572
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:11,430
my grandfather wasn't lying after all.

573
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:14,140
Or what's waiting for
us  when we get there.

574
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:53,250
but the one thing  we can say for
sure,with absolute certainty...

575
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,880
jackson?

576
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,490
Can I have some water?

577
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,850
is that there are moments that
take us to another place...

578
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,180
I know you don't understand me.

579
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:05,520
I don't understand me.

580
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:10,250
I wanted to show him compassion.

581
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,280
That's why I went.

582
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,590
That's the reaN.

583
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:16,800
And it was horrible.

584
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,780
It was horrible.

585
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,320
It's okay.

586
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,220
It's okay. It's okay.

587
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:32,960
She's in the car.

588
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:35,430
She's in the car,and
she won't stop crying.

589
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:37,260
Did you propose?

590
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:39,830
No.She went to william's execution.

591
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:42,770
Moments of heaven on earth...

592
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:07,890
and maybe for now,that's
all we need to know.
