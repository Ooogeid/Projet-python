1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,270
The skin is the largest organ in the body.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,310
It protects us.

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,430
Hold us together.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,900
Literally lets us know
what we are feeling.

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,489
Huh, reaction, observation, communication,

6
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:14,829
any questions so far?

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,179
We are doing this because chief Shepherd

8
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,999
suggests we brush up on our
patient sensitivity skills,

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,009
that's why.

10
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,379
And it just so happens, this
morning was a very good time,

11
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,840
besides, half of you
were raised by wolves.

12
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,900
Reaction.

13
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,419
"Keep your face impassive.

14
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,119
Whether prompted by a patient's
appearance or lab results,

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,619
facial expressions of surprise,
concern, disgust, etcetera

16
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,290
can be counterproductive."

17
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,280
Uh, la la la la la...

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,670
Jokes.

19
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,689
Don't make jokes about patients,

20
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,700
not in front of them, not even in private.

21
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,860
Well... Yang?

22
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,030
- What if the joke is really funny?
- It's not.

23
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:58,949
Neither was that one. Moving on.

24
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,379
We assess quickly in the
E.R. and go to radiology.

25
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,919
What if he has to be admitted?

26
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,069
Can we get to the surgical elevator?

27
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:05,169
What about the freight elevator?

28
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:06,439
Richard, are we set up for this?

29
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,279
I mean, our tables... do we have enough?

30
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,379
I don't know. Is our equipment gonna

31
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,719
- be strong enough?
- Well, they're five minutes out.

32
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,410
We'll have to figure it out as we go.

33
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,960
The skin can be soft and vulnerable...

34
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:21,730
Highly sensitive... easy to break.

35
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,199
- Is that Gary Clark?
- He's

36
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,879
filed a wrongful death
suit in his wife's case.

37
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,809
I'm being deposed today.

38
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,089
- Chief Shepherd. Hi.
- Yeah, hi. Whatever you're selling,

39
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,199
just leave the samples
in my office. Thank you.

40
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,440
I'm not a drug rep. I'm
your lawyer. Lauren Turner.

41
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,120
- Go. Don't worry. I got this.
- Okay.

42
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:35,930
Thank you. Dr. Shepherd, Lauren.

43
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,289
Let's... follow me, please.

44
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,860
Observation.

45
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,700
Yeah.

46
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,310
Ah.

47
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,099
Okay,"use reflective listening,

48
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,189
repeat the patient's
feelings back to them."

49
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,369
"Um, I hear that you're
concerned about the surgery.

50
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,360
Let me explain the risks."

51
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,989
"I can see you like vegetables.

52
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,530
After surgery, you might become one."

53
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,240
Communication.

54
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,139
Uh, "don't use jargon.

55
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,789
Use language that the
patient can understand.

56
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,999
- Be creative in using metaphors."
- Oh, I'm terrible with metaphors.

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,569
I can never come up with 'em.

58
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:11,180
Why, 'cause you're dumb
as a box of hammers?

59
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,559
You see, that's a good one.

60
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,119
You're an ass, but that was a good one.

61
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,269
"Be clear and comprehensive.

62
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,089
Explain all risks and
all probable outcomes,

63
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,289
leaving nothing out." Question... Adamson?

64
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,469
Why are you going so fast?

65
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,859
It just so happens that we have
an emergent patient arriving

66
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,209
who will need a little extra sensitivity.

67
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:29,660
So remember to employ your...

68
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,900
R-O-C,

69
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:35,339
and you will... hmm...
rock your patient's world.

70
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,270
Okay, that's enough of
that. Follow me to the pit.

71
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,079
Hustle!

72
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,790
The skin doesn't matter to a surgeon.

73
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,610
We'll cut right through it, go inside...

74
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,649
Find out the secrets underneath.

75
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,729
So did you get Izzie's message?

76
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,009
Did you sign the divorce papers?

77
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,909
Yeah, I a find 'em,
and then I'll send 'em.

78
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,420
Izzie sent you divorce papers?

79
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,930
Yeah. So?

80
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,760
Nothing. Just...
congratulations. Or... something.

81
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:01,599
Excuse me.

82
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,669
It takes delicacy and sensitivity.

83
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:06,089
- What's her problem?
- She cares. That's her problem.

84
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,809
- She cares about you.
- She doesn't. It's not like we're a thing.

85
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,410
Well, you should make it a
thing or put a stop to it.

86
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,259
All right, people, remember
what you've been taught.

87
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,699
Use it throughout the day.

88
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,400
There'll be consequences if you don't.

89
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:29,450
- What the hell is it?
- All right. Let's go.

90
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,200
What, did the circus come to town?

91
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,110
No... just the elephant.

92
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,519
- Avery, you're off the case.
- Go.

93
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,500
Oh... damn it.

94
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:44,700
Consequences.

95
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,270
We're gonna need a bigger hospital.

96
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,230
Coming through.

97
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,940
All right, on three. One, two...

98
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,590
Go! Oh!

99
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,340
Easy. That's it.

100
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,090
- Let's get him a chem panel, CBC and LFTs.
- Got it.

101
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,570
- And type and cross for two units.
- Now does that hurt?

102
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,600
Sweetheart, I can't even feel that.

103
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,079
- I'm having trouble finding a vein here.
- Or anywhere.

104
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,600
I'm using up all your doctors here.

105
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,670
There's probably somebody
dying somewhere, right?

106
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:19,320
X- ray.

107
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,529
Now I understand the sensitivity training.

108
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,590
Yeah. No fat jokes.

109
00:04:26,591 --> 00:04:28,809
- Yang, you're off the case.
- I said no fat j...

110
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,480
- Goodbye.
- Are you kidding...

111
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,750
Clear.

112
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,540
Okay.

113
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:39,660
Um, sir, when did the stomach
pains become more acute?

114
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,149
Oh, last couple days, I guess.

115
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:46,139
- It's hard to keep track. I'm a real busy guy.
- I'm here. I'm here.

116
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,779
- Let's roll him.
- Bobby, are you okay?

117
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,269
I'm sorry. And you are?

118
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,310
I'm his wife.

119
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,050
Facial expressions.

120
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,300
Hon, I'm fine.

121
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,050
Melissa worries.

122
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,080
She likes to mountains out of
molehills, and I'm already a mountain.

123
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,580
Man... tough crowd.

124
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,050
Mr. Corso, we're gonna
need to turn you over again.

125
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,180
Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

126
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:18,520
Dr. Webber.

127
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,360
Look at that.

128
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,240
You poppin' the hood down there?

129
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,730
Facial expressions.

130
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,290
Dr. Altman.

131
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,529
- Dibs.
- Do you need any help today?

132
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:42,699
I'm free. Aren't you both on
Webber's big emergent patient?

133
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,089
Oh, yeah, he got kicked
off for making a joke.

134
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,169
She got kicked off, too, so...

135
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,579
For not making a joke, so dibs.

136
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,950
All right, both of you. I've
got a consult in the pit.

137
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:53,979
Jamie Anders? Hi.

138
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,300
Hi. Dr. Torres.

139
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,809
Ooh, wow. What the hell
did you do to your knee?

140
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:02,339
Some jackass mowed me down
on my bike and then took off.

141
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,049
Oh. Hit-and-run? That sucks.

142
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,359
Okay, well, this is
probably gonna hurt a little,

143
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,719
but... I need to get in

144
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,180
- there and see what's going on, okay?
- Go for it.

145
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,949
Ow. Ow. No, no, no. Don't go for it. Oh.

146
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,860
- Sorry. You okay?
- Wow. This really blows.

147
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:18,250
- Yeah, that's one messed up patella.
- Plus, I'm out 20 bucks.

148
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,559
- What do you mean?
- My friend

149
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,670
said there's always
an upside to an injury,

150
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,049
and I said she was on crack.

151
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,889
And she said,"watch,
the doctor will be hot."

152
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,290
I said,"the doctor
will be old and gnarly."

153
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:31,690
And now you show up, which
means I owe her 20 bucks.

154
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,599
Nancy Temple, 39, complaining
of nausea and dizziness

155
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,949
since waking today.

156
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,619
En she threw up, twice.

157
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,919
And Kelly said I had to
go to the doctor, so...

158
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,889
At school, you have to if you vomit.

159
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,620
Good call, Kelly. Let's have a listen.

160
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:54,950
How's her E.K.G. look?

161
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:57,929
- Uh, it's coming up right now.
- Are you having any chest pains

162
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,970
or numbness in your arms or fingers?

163
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,710
No, not at all.

164
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,329
- Why?
- Well, Nancy, heart attack symptoms

165
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,629
show up completely differently
in women than in men.

166
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,659
They're often missed.

167
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,999
Sometimes they just look

168
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,569
- like stomach problems.
- Are you saying that...

169
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:14,149
- you're having a heart attack right now.
- Oh, my God.

170
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,759
- Let's hang a nitro drip and call the cath lab.
- Mommy.

171
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,479
What about my daughter? We're here alone.

172
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,859
We're flying back to Miami
tonight, and my husband needs...

173
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,039
we'll call your husband and
let him know what's going on,

174
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,449
and Dr. Yang will take care

175
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,079
- of Kelly until your tests are done.
- Mommy...

176
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,109
No. I mean, I... I should... 

177
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,530
it's patient sensitivity
day. Right, Dr. Yang?

178
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,489
- It's not a day.
- Take care of Kelly,

179
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:35,339
- and Avery will page you when we're ready.
- Mommy!

180
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,020
It's all right, sweetheart.

181
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,660
- I want to go with her.
- Yeah, I know, I know.

182
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:41,980
So do I.

183
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,729
Now how long has he had that infection?

184
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,100
Oh, I've never seen it
before. Nothing like that.

185
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,189
- What... what is it?
- We don't know yet.

186
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,639
It could be superficial or it might be

187
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,169
- something worse going on internally.
- I'm gonna be fine, baby.

188
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:57,540
Okay. Don't worry.

189
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,470
- Karev!
- Crap. I thought we'd clear it.

190
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:03,940
Let's take the sides off.

191
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,820
You should put a "wide
load" banner on this thing.

192
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,119
We have a gurney right here.
Can we move him onto this?

193
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,469
- No, I don't want to have him out...
- Yeah.

194
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:12,629
Yeah, yeah. I can do this.

195
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:15,149
- No, no, no, sir. Let us move you.
- No, Mr. Corso...

196
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:17,299
Come on. Come on. It's only two steps.

197
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,940
Oh, my... it's either that or you
gotta grease me up like a stuck pig,

198
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,659
- and nobody wants that job.
- He hasn't walked in a year. Bobby...

199
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,290
Oh, okay. Okay. Easy, easy.

200
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,850
Come on, sir. Okay.

201
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,270
I didn't think I could do this.

202
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,420
Oh, my God. Baby, you're standing!

203
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,980
You know what this reminds me of?

204
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,310
Huh?

205
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:41,450
Our wedding.

206
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,400
Oh! Uh...

207
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,609
Um, bimalleolar ankle fractures.

208
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:57,370
To weak to support his
weight. He can go to C.T. now.

209
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,569
He's not going in that C.T.

210
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:00,039
Look, I think if we can position him,

211
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,799
we could... it's rated for
half his weight. If it breaks,

212
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,229
he gets hurt again, and it's not available

213
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,879
for the 50 other patients
who need it today.

214
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,010
Oh, what about the zoo?

215
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,959
They gotta have a CT. for, like, rhinos,

216
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,659
- right?
- Percy, you're off the case. Goodbye.

217
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,040
- No, that wasn't a joke. That was an actual suggestion.
- Go.

218
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,559
It's a pretty good idea, actually.

219
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,759
It's a terrible idea.

220
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,089
We will spare this man the indignity
of treating him like a zoo animal.

221
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:24,459
If we can't get an image, then we'll
go with clinical labs and tests.

222
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,109
I could do a nuclear
stress test on his heart.

223
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,880
I just wish that I could
get him on a treadmill.

224
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,440
Well, that's not gonna happen.

225
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,659
All right. I have a lawyer
waiting for me. I have to go.

226
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,769
But I want to have a
meeting with all of you

227
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:37,689
when his studies come back

228
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:40,599
- before we go any further down this road, okay?
- Let's work him up.

229
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,480
Mm- hmm.

230
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,439
Uh, so just a couple more questions.

231
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,390
Um, his diabetes,

232
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:53,999
did he have it before he...
he was im... immobilized?

233
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,490
- No, that's since he put on the weight.
- And that's been, um...

234
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,409
How long has... has...

235
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,920
- how long has he been like this?
- Yeah.

236
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:05,929
Uh, 5 years ago, his
company laid off 300 employees.

237
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,869
He tried to find work for two years.

238
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,000
One was hiring.

239
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,020
And then he stopped trying.

240
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,719
It was real hard on him, and food...

241
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,440
well, food made him feel better, so...

242
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,690
I think he's been in pain for a while.

243
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:21,120
He'd tell me it's indigestion,
but I... I couldn't ignore it.

244
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,730
After the news, I just had to call.

245
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:24,940
The news?

246
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,220
Well, we're... we're gonna
have a baby. I'm pregnant.

247
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,020
How?

248
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,430
Uh... um...

249
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,470
I mean, wow. Congratulations.

250
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,070
That is... that's... that's joyous news.

251
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,280
Mm.

252
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,890
- Hey.
- Hey.

253
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,219
Your deposition's today.

254
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,549
Yeah. Hey, let me ask you something.

255
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:57,380
- Teddy and Owen... can they work together?
- Uh, what do you mean?

256
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,529
Nothing. I was just surprised that he
didn't go to bat for her getting the job.

257
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:03,709
- It was like he wanted her to go.
- Uh, really?

258
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,570
Yeah, I gotta go. I... good luck.

259
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:08,610
Hey, what are you doing?

260
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,339
Um, Bobby Corso's labs.

261
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,190
You're still on fatty fatty 2x4?

262
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,349
- Oh, no fair.
- Um, name-calling.

263
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,039
- Who's this?
- Oh, my patient's kid.

264
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,739
Social worker won't return my page.

265
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,919
- Well, that's not very social.
- Uh, where's Callie?

266
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,570
- She's been whining for a kid.
- Cristina.

267
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,180
What?

268
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,920
Um... eh, never mind.

269
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:36,089
They have no case. Gary Clark is grieving.

270
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,829
You can do me one favor in there.

271
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,639
Try not to refer to her
as "Mrs. Clark" or "she."

272
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,770
Don't use pronouns. Just
stick to "the patient."

273
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,360
It keeps it less emotional.

274
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,300
Okay.

275
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,120
So why is he here?

276
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,160
Sorry?

277
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:53,430
Gary Clark.

278
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,539
He shouldn't be here for this.
He doesn't need to hear this.

279
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,000
He's the plaintiff. It's his prerogative.

280
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:00,070
- Don't let it bother you.
- I'm more worried it's gonna bother him.

281
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,130
Sorry. I have to go.

282
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,299
Hey. Is the meeting with
Shepherd in the conference room?

283
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:12,930
Mm-hmm.

284
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:17,750
Thank you.

285
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,980
My contract came in, and...

286
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,540
Cristina told me that you
put in a good word, so...

287
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,170
Thanks.

288
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,410
Of course.

289
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,570
What?

290
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,870
Nothing.

291
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,889
- What are we looking at?
- Patient's got

292
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,479
a severe deep tissue
infection under his belly.

293
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,049
There's a pretty significant abscess.

294
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,899
Hunt and I need to get in there and
debride, clear out the infected fat.

295
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,499
That much sudden fat loss is dangerous.

296
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,599
It's preferable to him
dying of an infection.

297
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,029
But it's a risky surgery, yes.

298
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,399
But we'll have Bailey
and Webber on standby

299
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,659
- in case he goes south.
- What is the surgical risk calculation

300
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,499
- on a patient like this?
- Almost too high to calculate.

301
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,479
Five times the risk of heart attack,

302
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,329
respiratory failure, airway complications.

303
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,139
He's diabetic, so there's
a risk of ketoacidotic coma.

304
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,519
- High risk of pulmonary embolism.
- And believe it or not,

305
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,849
he's malnourished, which
leads to slow healing,

306
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,779
renal failure... nerve damage...

307
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,169
- Post-op infection.
- I'm saying no. The risk is too high.

308
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,789
That's all. Thank you
very much, but that's it.

309
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,869
So you're saying we're
gonna send him away to die?

310
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,619
I'm saying we send him
to a bariatric center

311
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,330
that's prepared for a
type of patient like this

312
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,799
instead of us spending
our time and resources

313
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,500
caring for someone who obviously
does not care for himself.

314
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,840
Derek, he's me,

315
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,050
just swap out the booze for the food.

316
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,410
You don't think I care about myself?

317
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,459
He has an illness that he cannot control.

318
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,440
- He needs help.
- I'm sorry. I...

319
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,020
That wasn't you in there.

320
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,019
And that wasn't about Bobby Corso.

321
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,430
It was about Gary Clark.

322
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,979
You are seeing potential lawsuits

323
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,450
where you used to see patients.

324
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,489
It's the job, Derek. The job

325
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,900
- can change your priorities.
- Excuse me. Shepherd?

326
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,820
Derek, don't let it.

327
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,840
Tell Sloan to go ahead, open him up.

328
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,380
Yes, Hunt.

329
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:17,450
That conversation we had about Altman,

330
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,000
did you share that with anyone?

331
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,039
I...

332
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,380
Did you share that with your wife?

333
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:26,559
- Did Meredith say something?
- When I make

334
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,739
a professional recommendation
about a fell attending,

335
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,699
I expect it to be kept in confidence.

336
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,749
I do not expect to hear about
it from one of my residents.

337
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,310
I thought I could assume that much.

338
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,010
How's your day going?

339
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:41,830
Dr. Grey.

340
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:45,149
Uh, yeah. Uh, Jamie, we are
going to open up your knee,

341
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,909
and we're gonna wire all
the pieces of your patella

342
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:49,289
- back together.
- Are you gonna do the operation?

343
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:51,670
- Yep.
- You'll hold my hand through the whole thing?

344
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,420
I think it's better if
I'm holding the scalpel.

345
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,870
But I can hold your hand right now.

346
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,280
Fine.

347
00:14:58,610 --> 00:14:59,530
Okay.

348
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,090
Do you have any other questions?

349
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:06,029
I can't think of anything, but, uh, I
don't want the hand-holding part to end.

350
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,990
So... can we sit here a minute?

351
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,530
You are so bad.

352
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,820
I will see you in the O.R.

353
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,580
Wow. Should we have left you two alone?

354
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:22,970
What?

355
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,079
Getting a little steamy in there.

356
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,119
Oh, give me a break. I'm
in a committed relationship.

357
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,649
That was chitchat. Yeah, there was steam.

358
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:32,979
- It was steamy chitchat.
- With hand-holding.

359
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:37,009
Yeah, physical contact's an important
part of establishing a patient's trust.

360
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:38,839
Bailey did patient
sensitivity this morning.

361
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,109
- Did she teach you nothing?
- So there

362
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:42,529
was no flirting going on.
I was just imagining that.

363
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,069
Yeah, sure. She was kinda flirty

364
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:47,520
and I was flirting back because
I'm trying to put her at ease.

365
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,670
Talking to the patient the
way the patient talks to you

366
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,030
makes 'em feel understood and safe and...

367
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,600
You're morons.

368
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,680
Oh, and a little pervy. Jeez.

369
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,429
Put me down for 715.

370
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:10,160
Got it.

371
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,519
What happens at 7:15?

372
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,069
715 is her bet.

373
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:15,580
I'm making a pool on Bobby
Corso's actual weight.

374
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:18,350
20 bucks, closest without
going overs the pot.

375
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,300
You want in?

376
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,350
How are you still on that case?

377
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:25,430
Artificial insemination. It had to be.

378
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,870
- Wait. What are we talking about?
- Bobby Corso.

379
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:31,459
- How did they make a baby?
- He hasn't left the house in five years.

380
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,559
It took a truck to get him
here. How is he supposed to go

381
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,269
to a fertility clinic to fill up a cup?

382
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,890
How does he find it to fill up a cup?

383
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,960
You know, they can still
do it the regular way.

384
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,170
- Right?
- Have you seen the guy move?

385
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:44,050
'Cause he can't, really, at all.

386
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,930
Well, maybe he doesn't have
to. Maybe she does all the work.

387
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,940
But how? I mean...

388
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,040
I'm finished.

389
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,180
Oh, um...

390
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,820
get yourself some ice cream.

391
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,200
But I'm not allowed to
have that much sugar.

392
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,439
Well, get some roast beef then.

393
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,490
She can sit.

394
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,110
No, she can't. We're
talking about s-e-x.

395
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,930
I'm 9, and you just spelled "sex."

396
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,729
That's good.

397
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,469
Okay, you know what? Let's say...

398
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:16,129
- This is the wife.
- No. Don't do that.

399
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:18,590
And this is... him.

400
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,169
Guess I won't be eating that now.

401
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,439
Okay, well, she's gotta be on top.

402
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,019
She might get altitude sickness.

403
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,950
Guys.

404
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,700
Uh, s... sorry. Um...

405
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:33,160
It's all right. I get it.

406
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:34,899
You're... you're trying to figure out

407
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,960
how my husband and I managed
to get a baby in here.

408
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,369
There are some logistics involved.

409
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:40,390
You want me to tell you?

410
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,989
But fit, how about you tell me

411
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,360
how you like to do it with your husband?

412
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,680
Or your girlfriend?
Any favorite positions?

413
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,089
Or kinks...

414
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:54,149
let's talk about that, because I know

415
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,450
you all must have a freak
show of your own going on.

416
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:57,710
Who wants to go first?

417
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:02,510
No? Nobody?

418
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:04,790
Okay.

419
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:09,500
Well, it's probably none
of my damn business anyway.

420
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,500
The fat under your skin
has become necrotic...

421
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,930
has... has died,

422
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,980
and the infection is
eating through your skin.

423
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,790
Well, I suppose it had to come to that.

424
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,949
I've eaten everything else.

425
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,900
The operation is extremely risky.

426
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,839
You have a higher than normal chance

427
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,910
that a surgical complication can kill you.

428
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:46,820
If I don't have the surgery, I die?

429
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,040
How long will I have, do you think?

430
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:55,490
Mr. Corso, you want the surgery.

431
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:57,949
You want to try...

432
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,060
I've tried...

433
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,160
everything.

434
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:08,810
High protein, the low carbs,
drugs, pills, hypnosis...

435
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,390
I have tried everything.

436
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:14,459
You have a baby on the
way. Think about that.

437
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,860
Who do you think I'm thinking about?

438
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,710
You...

439
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,710
you dream of having a kid.

440
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,250
You picture yourself
playing ball with him.

441
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,920
You picture her standing on your feet...

442
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,790
while you dance around with her, you know?

443
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:35,310
You don't picture them
bringing you food and...

444
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,300
Cleaning you up.

445
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,560
I can't walk four steps
to go to the bathroom.

446
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,400
You tell me...

447
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,450
who deserves that guy as a father?

448
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,310
No...

449
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,180
I just...

450
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,620
Want to be gone before the kid
has a chance to know who I am.

451
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,450
Don't tell my wife about this, okay?

452
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,180
Let's just tell her it's too risky.

453
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,670
Let me go home.

454
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,900
Oh, hey, peanut.

455
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,200
What's going on?

456
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,200
Can we see my mom now?

457
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,970
- I'm trying to find out.
- Is she gonna be okay?

458
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,780
- You want an honest answer?
- Yes.

459
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:31,649
I don't know.

460
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:32,890
Do you know anything?

461
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,030
I hear that you're scared.

462
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:43,980
It's scary, uh, when your mom or
dad gets hurt and you feel alone.

463
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,750
How do you know?

464
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,440
'Cause when I was your age,

465
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,549
my dad and I were in a car accident,

466
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:54,430
and he was hurt, and I was really scared.

467
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:56,220
So I know.

468
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,156
Was your dad okay?

469
00:21:02,848 --> 00:21:04,482
Yep. He was fine.

470
00:21:04,516 --> 00:21:06,618
Now let's go see about your mom.

471
00:21:07,315 --> 00:21:09,643
- Coming through!
- Oh... hey, get back, get back.

472
00:21:09,644 --> 00:21:11,011
What, uh, what happened?

473
00:21:11,046 --> 00:21:12,987
Echo shows a ventricular wall rupture.

474
00:21:12,988 --> 00:21:14,392
O.R. two is ready. They're waiting.

475
00:21:14,393 --> 00:21:16,059
- Yang, are you coming?
- Yeah.

476
00:21:16,094 --> 00:21:18,295
- Um, uh, what about the kid?
- I'll take her.

477
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:19,630
Mommy?

478
00:21:19,664 --> 00:21:22,232
Mommy!

479
00:21:22,267 --> 00:21:24,167
Um, uh, do you need me?

480
00:21:24,202 --> 00:21:26,169
- What?
- You have Avery. Do you need me?

481
00:21:26,204 --> 00:21:28,471
Yang, in or out, let's go. Um...

482
00:21:29,674 --> 00:21:31,408
Yang.

483
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:44,506
You wanted me to sign discharge papers?

484
00:21:48,177 --> 00:21:50,246
Mrs. Corso, I...

485
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,749
I'm sorry about the thing
in the... the cafeteria.

486
00:21:52,783 --> 00:21:54,784
It's easy to make jokes about him.

487
00:21:54,819 --> 00:21:57,254
You didn't know him before.

488
00:21:57,289 --> 00:21:59,390
You don't know that inside all that

489
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:02,594
is the same man I've always known,

490
00:22:02,628 --> 00:22:05,597
who can make me laugh
till I can't breathe.

491
00:22:05,631 --> 00:22:08,433
He's been trying to ma
you guys laugh all day,

492
00:22:08,468 --> 00:22:11,403
but you're too disgusted to even smile

493
00:22:11,437 --> 00:22:13,472
or joke with him...

494
00:22:13,506 --> 00:22:16,175
Make him feel like a person.

495
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:20,546
I brought him here because
I thought you would help him.

496
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:24,282
But you're only making him feel worse.

497
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:28,033
So unless you want to
tell me the next step

498
00:22:28,067 --> 00:22:29,935
to getting him outta here and home,

499
00:22:29,969 --> 00:22:32,070
I don't need to hear anything from you.

500
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,186
Are you bringing my forklift around?

501
00:22:51,187 --> 00:22:53,822
We thought we'd just open
up the loading dock...

502
00:22:53,856 --> 00:22:55,323
And, uh, roll you out.

503
00:22:55,358 --> 00:22:57,559
That's good.

504
00:22:57,593 --> 00:22:59,527
Right into Puget sound.

505
00:22:59,562 --> 00:23:01,529
You'll float me home like a barge.

506
00:23:02,697 --> 00:23:04,465
I got a good one.

507
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,072
- Yeah?
- What did they call the guy who was so fat

508
00:23:07,073 --> 00:23:09,284
- that he couldn't get out of the house?
- What?

509
00:23:09,285 --> 00:23:12,686
Dead... and selfish.

510
00:23:12,721 --> 00:23:19,893
Yeah, 'cause, uh, you
left a... a 700-pound mess

511
00:23:16,691 --> 00:23:19,893
for your wife to clean up.

512
00:23:22,233 --> 00:23:23,612
That's a good one.

513
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:28,851
Look, I'm sorry that we've been
tiptoeing around you all day

514
00:23:28,885 --> 00:23:31,687
trying not to make jokes.

515
00:23:31,721 --> 00:23:34,290
But you're the one who's gotta stop.

516
00:23:34,324 --> 00:23:37,754
Stop calling yourself the fat guy.

517
00:23:37,755 --> 00:23:40,062
You got a wife who loves you,

518
00:23:40,096 --> 00:23:43,131
you know, who stuck by
you through all this.

519
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:46,301
I mean, you did something
right to deserve that.

520
00:23:46,335 --> 00:23:49,204
Look, I know what it's like to
have life hand you so much crap,

521
00:23:49,238 --> 00:23:52,240
you just want to sit on the couch and die.

522
00:23:52,274 --> 00:23:55,276
But you gotta look at
what's in front of you.

523
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:58,178
You can't just walk out on her now.

524
00:23:58,213 --> 00:24:00,599
She deserves better.

525
00:24:04,389 --> 00:24:07,029
Chances are you're
gonna die on that table.

526
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,165
Then you get what you want.

527
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:12,335
But at least your wife
will think you tried.

528
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:14,805
She'll tell your kid you tried.

529
00:24:17,739 --> 00:24:19,622
Give 'em that at least.

530
00:25:14,376 --> 00:25:16,064
How'd you get back on the surgery?

531
00:25:16,065 --> 00:25:17,600
They said they needed big guys.

532
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:19,902
Karev, Percy, retracting the abdomen.

533
00:25:19,937 --> 00:25:23,172
Adamson, stay there. Kepner, over there.

534
00:25:23,207 --> 00:25:25,508
Where do you want me?

535
00:25:25,542 --> 00:25:27,844
I think we are good.

536
00:25:29,568 --> 00:25:30,900
That's all we need.

537
00:25:39,127 --> 00:25:42,262
- Did you irrigate the ears to induce an ocular response?
- No.

538
00:25:42,297 --> 00:25:43,930
- That was not necessary.
- Why?

539
00:25:43,965 --> 00:25:45,833
The patient had a pupillary response.

540
00:25:45,867 --> 00:25:47,956
So you saw life in her eyes?

541
00:25:52,245 --> 00:25:53,740
There was a pupillary response.

542
00:25:53,741 --> 00:25:54,752
Yet, you declared her dead.

543
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:56,176
No, you misunderstand what I'm saying.

544
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:57,644
Absence of a pupillary response

545
00:25:57,678 --> 00:25:58,953
is one of the signs of brain death,

546
00:25:58,954 --> 00:26:00,257
yet, you declared her brain dead.

547
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:02,067
I never declared her brain dead.

548
00:26:02,068 --> 00:26:04,504
She had minimal brain activity.

549
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:06,992
Now I'm sorry.

550
00:26:06,993 --> 00:26:07,969
I tried to explain to you

551
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:09,842
- that there was absolutely no...
-  So she was alive

552
00:26:09,877 --> 00:26:12,512
until you withdrew care,
until you pulled the plug?

553
00:26:12,546 --> 00:26:14,447
I'm sorry. I'm not being clear.

554
00:26:14,481 --> 00:26:18,818
Um... according to the letter
of her advanced directive,

555
00:26:18,852 --> 00:26:22,255
there was a level of brain activity

556
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,290
- that I judged to be...
-  You judged?

557
00:26:24,324 --> 00:26:26,192
It... you decided?

558
00:26:26,226 --> 00:26:28,728
It was my opinion to...

559
00:26:28,762 --> 00:26:30,163
Should we stop now?

560
00:26:30,197 --> 00:26:32,133
Yes, I'm gonna suggest
that we take a break,

561
00:26:32,134 --> 00:26:34,178
get ourselves together, resume later on.

562
00:26:34,179 --> 00:26:37,615
- Does that sound all right?
- Fine.

563
00:26:42,494 --> 00:26:44,934
- Do you remember when I told you they don't have a case?
- Yes.

564
00:26:44,935 --> 00:26:47,954
With respect, Dr. Shepherd, please
stop trying to give them one.

565
00:26:47,955 --> 00:26:50,052
Do not apologize.

566
00:26:53,632 --> 00:26:55,097
Okay.

567
00:26:58,977 --> 00:27:00,877
The infection's really deep.

568
00:27:00,912 --> 00:27:03,847
Underneath all this
fat is just... more fat.

569
00:27:03,882 --> 00:27:05,982
Yep. I'm down to the abdominal wall.

570
00:27:06,017 --> 00:27:08,085
- How's the fascia?
- Not too good.

571
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:09,730
Want to take a look inside?

572
00:27:10,821 --> 00:27:13,991
It's probably a can of worms, but...

573
00:27:13,992 --> 00:27:15,020
Yeah.

574
00:27:16,161 --> 00:27:19,699
Let's have a... little peek.

575
00:27:23,102 --> 00:27:26,438
Ah, damn it. Gonna have to go in.

576
00:27:26,473 --> 00:27:29,447
Bailey, Webber, scrub in... fast.

577
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:30,276
Okay.

578
00:27:38,469 --> 00:27:40,131
So there's a hole in the wall?

579
00:27:40,537 --> 00:27:42,805
Right, and the blood is supposed to go

580
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,686
from one room to another,
except it's just...

581
00:27:45,687 --> 00:27:47,488
Rushing outside through the hole.

582
00:27:47,522 --> 00:27:49,456
And it can't get to her brain?

583
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:51,190
Got it.

584
00:27:51,225 --> 00:27:53,593
Yes. Or to her lungs.

585
00:27:53,627 --> 00:27:56,062
So they're going to sew up the hole.

586
00:27:56,096 --> 00:27:59,732
They'll try to, but the
heart has to be strong,

587
00:27:59,767 --> 00:28:03,370
like, um, like nylon, like your shoes.

588
00:28:04,572 --> 00:28:08,308
Your mom's heart is weak, like paper.

589
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,427
What happens if she dies?

590
00:28:17,859 --> 00:28:20,294
We'll talk about that if that happens.

591
00:28:20,329 --> 00:28:23,264
Gotcha. Mine.

592
00:28:36,946 --> 00:28:39,982
If your mom dies...

593
00:28:40,016 --> 00:28:42,518
you'll feel a lot of things.

594
00:28:45,678 --> 00:28:47,512
First you'll feel like, uh,

595
00:28:47,546 --> 00:28:49,513
you coulda done more to help her,

596
00:28:49,548 --> 00:28:52,750
but... that's not true.

597
00:28:52,785 --> 00:28:55,620
You did everything you could.

598
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:01,426
It won't feel that way, but...

599
00:29:01,461 --> 00:29:03,595
remember me telling you this.

600
00:29:03,629 --> 00:29:06,064
You did everything you could.

601
00:29:07,934 --> 00:29:09,901
And it'll hurt...

602
00:29:09,936 --> 00:29:12,304
every time you think of her.

603
00:29:14,407 --> 00:29:18,077
But over time, it will hurt less and less.

604
00:29:19,018 --> 00:29:22,387
And eventually...

605
00:29:22,422 --> 00:29:24,289
you'll remember her,

606
00:29:24,323 --> 00:29:27,526
and... it'll only hurt a little.

607
00:29:44,179 --> 00:29:47,029
Okay, so I'm not gonna be here in
the morning when they let you go,

608
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:50,142
so if it hurts before your
follow-up, give me a call.

609
00:29:50,143 --> 00:29:53,015
Okay? And... and if it's
oozing green stuff, call me.

610
00:29:53,016 --> 00:29:55,370
Can I call you if it's late at night

611
00:29:55,371 --> 00:29:56,782
and I'm kinda drunk

612
00:29:56,783 --> 00:29:59,794
and I run across an old John
Hughes movie on the tube?

613
00:29:59,795 --> 00:30:02,033
Wow. Um...

614
00:30:02,544 --> 00:30:05,226
- I don't, uh... here.
- I don't think...

615
00:30:06,489 --> 00:30:08,804
Oh. Wh... just...

616
00:30:10,316 --> 00:30:11,858
use that...

617
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:16,089
aAs the spirit moves you.

618
00:30:18,093 --> 00:30:19,214
Now...

619
00:30:19,537 --> 00:30:21,122
Get outta here.

620
00:30:21,172 --> 00:30:22,664
I'm on drugs.

621
00:30:22,665 --> 00:30:25,012
Ahh. O... okay.

622
00:30:31,441 --> 00:30:34,426
No. Uh, pull that back more.
I can't see what I'm doing.

623
00:30:34,427 --> 00:30:36,640
- This? Is this good?
- No. More.

624
00:30:37,313 --> 00:30:39,611
I think I found the culprit.

625
00:30:39,612 --> 00:30:40,739
Diverticulitis...

626
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:43,329
perforated colon, completely infected.

627
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:44,844
- How long's he been under?
- Too long.

628
00:30:44,845 --> 00:30:47,346
This abscess will kill him if
we don't get it under control.

629
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:52,615
- Oh, okay, keep it together.
- Okay, let's pick up the pace, people.

630
00:30:52,616 --> 00:30:54,139
Laps. Come on.

631
00:30:54,678 --> 00:30:55,657
More.

632
00:30:56,781 --> 00:30:58,281
Pack it in.

633
00:31:07,345 --> 00:31:09,166
Hey. How's the deposition going?

634
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:10,623
Apparently I can't tell you.

635
00:31:10,624 --> 00:31:12,898
Why did you tell Hunt what I told you?

636
00:31:12,899 --> 00:31:14,375
I didn't. I told him nothing.

637
00:31:14,376 --> 00:31:15,615
He... he came to me and said you knew.

638
00:31:15,616 --> 00:31:17,987
No, I told him nothing.
I just looked at him... 

639
00:31:17,988 --> 00:31:19,884
You looked at him?
Meredith, when you're pissed,

640
00:31:19,885 --> 00:31:20,960
your face says everything you're thinking.

641
00:31:20,961 --> 00:31:22,471
So now I have a staff that can't trust me.

642
00:31:22,472 --> 00:31:25,110
Well, so what am I supposed
to do, control my face?

643
00:31:25,111 --> 00:31:26,375
Yes, you were. Control your face.

644
00:31:26,376 --> 00:31:28,717
Maybe you shouldn't tell me
things you don't want me to know.

645
00:31:28,718 --> 00:31:30,734
- Control that.
- Then I can't tell you anything.

646
00:31:30,735 --> 00:31:32,652
Then 80% of my day is
off-limits to my wife,

647
00:31:32,653 --> 00:31:35,575
- and I don't want that.
- Well, I don't want that either. I'm sorry.

648
00:31:36,379 --> 00:31:38,246
I know. It's just...

649
00:31:38,247 --> 00:31:40,548
- But I have to tell Cristina.
- No.

650
00:31:40,549 --> 00:31:42,133
Meredith, damn it. What
are we talking about?

651
00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:43,907
Owen lied to her,

652
00:31:43,908 --> 00:31:46,364
and he must have done that
because he still wants Teddy.

653
00:31:46,365 --> 00:31:47,969
- Doesn't matter.
- It doesn't matter to you.

654
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,475
Cristina is still my best friend.

655
00:31:49,476 --> 00:31:50,672
And I get that you're the chief now,

656
00:31:50,673 --> 00:31:52,518
but she's still the person
that she's always been.

657
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:54,922
So am I supposed to stand
around and watch her get hurt?

658
00:31:54,923 --> 00:31:58,565
- What am I supposed to do?
- Chief Shepherd, they're ready.

659
00:31:59,771 --> 00:32:02,390
Nothing. You do nothing.

660
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,791
Where's the little girl?

661
00:32:17,792 --> 00:32:19,790
Uh, social services came.

662
00:32:19,791 --> 00:32:21,443
We put her to bed in a patient room.

663
00:32:21,444 --> 00:32:23,566
Her dad should be here
by the time she wakes up.

664
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:26,180
Good. You were great with her today.

665
00:32:26,583 --> 00:32:27,900
Thanks.

666
00:32:30,278 --> 00:32:31,706
So when did your mom die?

667
00:32:32,564 --> 00:32:34,046
Uh, she didn't.

668
00:32:34,047 --> 00:32:35,861
Your dad then?

669
00:32:38,326 --> 00:32:40,580
I'm sorry if that's, like, too personal.

670
00:32:40,581 --> 00:32:43,635
It was just really clear from the
way you were talking to her today.

671
00:32:43,636 --> 00:32:45,129
It's been a long day.

672
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,629
I just thought you might
want to talk about it.

673
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:48,173
That's very insightful of you.

674
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:53,895
You're a... super... super sensitive man.

675
00:32:55,636 --> 00:32:58,200
You know what? Let me tell
you what you saw today.

676
00:32:58,201 --> 00:33:01,372
I reflectively listened
to a patient's concerns,

677
00:33:01,373 --> 00:33:04,208
I spoke to her in a language
she could understand,

678
00:33:04,209 --> 00:33:08,340
I clearly stated the possible
communications and probable outcomes.

679
00:33:08,341 --> 00:33:09,903
That's all you saw today...

680
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:12,354
me kicking patient sensitivity ass.

681
00:33:12,355 --> 00:33:14,415
So go be someone else's dishrag.

682
00:33:22,715 --> 00:33:24,171
Hey, what are you doing tonight?

683
00:33:24,172 --> 00:33:25,975
Do you want to drink?
I think we should drink.

684
00:33:25,976 --> 00:33:27,908
Although maybe I shouldn't,
because then I'll talk

685
00:33:27,909 --> 00:33:29,881
and, you know, I'm not allowed to talk

686
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:31,500
or make facial expressions...

687
00:33:31,501 --> 00:33:33,229
can you go away please?
Just go... go away!

688
00:33:36,395 --> 00:33:38,267
What is it?

689
00:33:38,268 --> 00:33:39,967
Cristina, what's wrong?

690
00:33:39,968 --> 00:33:41,759
Owen. Can you get me Owen, please?

691
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:47,612
And describe what you
saw in Mrs. Clark's scans.

692
00:33:47,613 --> 00:33:50,032
The patient suffered an
acute hemorrhagic stroke

693
00:33:50,033 --> 00:33:51,385
in the left temporal lobe.

694
00:33:51,386 --> 00:33:53,682
And based on those scans and the E.E.G.,

695
00:33:53,683 --> 00:33:56,025
you recommended that care be withdrawn?

696
00:33:56,026 --> 00:33:57,955
According to the advanced...

697
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,287
Yes.

698
00:34:01,288 --> 00:34:02,733
How long did that take?

699
00:34:02,734 --> 00:34:04,786
From the time you looked at the scans

700
00:34:04,787 --> 00:34:08,205
until you decided to end her
life, how much time elapsed?

701
00:34:08,206 --> 00:34:10,392
We had to talk to the patient's family,

702
00:34:10,393 --> 00:34:12,322
assemble an ethics review committee...

703
00:34:12,323 --> 00:34:14,725
I'm talking about your
assessment, Dr. Shepherd.

704
00:34:14,726 --> 00:34:18,786
How long did it take you to decide
to recommend that she should die?

705
00:34:21,966 --> 00:34:24,771
- Less than a minute.
- Less than a minute?

706
00:34:24,772 --> 00:34:26,140
In my professional opinion,

707
00:34:26,141 --> 00:34:27,377
there was no other option.

708
00:34:27,378 --> 00:34:28,834
32 years.

709
00:34:31,707 --> 00:34:34,756
Uh, I think we have
everything we need here.

710
00:34:34,757 --> 00:34:37,080
Alison and I were married for 32 years.

711
00:34:38,049 --> 00:34:42,054
I loved her for more than... half my life.

712
00:34:43,069 --> 00:34:45,732
And you decide to kill
her in less than a minute?

713
00:34:47,508 --> 00:34:48,710
Mr. Clark...

714
00:34:49,332 --> 00:34:51,591
I'm so sorry for your loss. I begged you.

715
00:34:52,121 --> 00:34:54,019
And you just kept saying you're sorry.

716
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,561
You just kept saying
legal this and legal that.

717
00:34:56,562 --> 00:34:58,343
- All right. This is no longer productive.
- Yeah, Gary...

718
00:34:58,344 --> 00:35:02,091
I begged you, but you
signed her death sentence,

719
00:35:02,092 --> 00:35:04,109
and you didn't even show up to do the job!

720
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,963
You're a coward, Dr. Shepherd!

721
00:35:05,964 --> 00:35:08,910
- You're a coward and a killer.
- Gary, come on.

722
00:35:08,911 --> 00:35:09,951
Come on.

723
00:35:10,945 --> 00:35:12,996
Come with me. Come on.

724
00:35:20,752 --> 00:35:22,263
Dr. Shepherd, can I have a word?

725
00:35:22,264 --> 00:35:23,272
What?

726
00:35:23,992 --> 00:35:25,162
Nothing.

727
00:35:25,163 --> 00:35:27,400
I'm just keeping you
here till Clark is gone.

728
00:35:28,396 --> 00:35:30,977
You're a kind man, Dr. Shepherd.
I respect that. I admire that.

729
00:35:30,978 --> 00:35:32,859
But he's grieving, and they have no case.

730
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,401
He got to say what he needed to say,

731
00:35:34,402 --> 00:35:37,298
and the kindest thing you can
say to him right now is nothing.

732
00:35:37,299 --> 00:35:40,044
You cat help him and you
won't help your hospital.

733
00:35:42,833 --> 00:35:44,007
It's over.

734
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:47,147
I know you want to do more, but it's over.

735
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,907
It was a pleasure working with you.

736
00:35:56,304 --> 00:35:57,635
So you told her?

737
00:35:57,636 --> 00:35:59,383
I didn't say anything to her.

738
00:36:04,076 --> 00:36:06,029
What? What is it?

739
00:36:07,118 --> 00:36:09,027
What happened?

740
00:36:31,012 --> 00:36:33,202
I... I miss my dad.

741
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:48,103
Bobby, you survived the surgery,

742
00:36:48,104 --> 00:36:50,090
but you're not nearly out of the woods.

743
00:36:50,091 --> 00:36:52,092
We still have to watch you very closely

744
00:36:52,093 --> 00:36:53,400
for post-op infections,

745
00:36:53,401 --> 00:36:56,413
and you're gonna have to make
some serious lifestyle changes.

746
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:59,343
I know. I need to lose the weight.

747
00:36:59,344 --> 00:37:02,104
You have no choice if you want to survive.

748
00:37:03,713 --> 00:37:05,120
Well...

749
00:37:05,121 --> 00:37:07,157
Then I have no choice.

750
00:37:10,779 --> 00:37:11,828
Right?

751
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:37,941
How'd it go?

752
00:37:39,597 --> 00:37:41,982
Derek, you can talk to me.

753
00:37:41,983 --> 00:37:43,194
I don't want to think about

754
00:37:43,195 --> 00:37:46,193
what I can and can't say and
who I can and can't say it to.

755
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:50,750
I can't do it anymore today.

756
00:37:51,873 --> 00:37:53,634
I love you.

757
00:37:54,075 --> 00:37:55,671
You know that, right?

758
00:37:57,923 --> 00:37:59,407
I love you, too.

759
00:38:10,951 --> 00:38:13,489
No matter how thick-skinned
we try to be...

760
00:38:15,309 --> 00:38:17,287
Did you find out Bobby Corso's weight?

761
00:38:17,288 --> 00:38:19,235
678.

762
00:38:19,236 --> 00:38:20,904
So who won your stupid pool?

763
00:38:22,229 --> 00:38:23,324
Bailey.

764
00:38:23,325 --> 00:38:24,639
Bailey?

765
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,848
Wait, she bet in your pool

766
00:38:26,849 --> 00:38:28,319
after all of that?

767
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,180
Are you kidding me?

768
00:38:30,181 --> 00:38:32,682
My God, the hypocrisy.

769
00:38:32,683 --> 00:38:33,794
Th...

770
00:38:35,402 --> 00:38:38,656
there's millions of electrified
nerve endings in there...

771
00:38:49,913 --> 00:38:51,304
You going home?

772
00:38:52,041 --> 00:38:53,832
Yeah.

773
00:38:53,833 --> 00:38:55,440
You want to go together?

774
00:38:56,574 --> 00:38:58,596
Yeah.

775
00:39:04,235 --> 00:39:06,302
Open and exposed...

776
00:39:07,533 --> 00:39:09,688
And feeling way too much.

777
00:39:11,023 --> 00:39:12,748
Hey! We scored.

778
00:39:12,749 --> 00:39:14,270
My cousins said we can
use their time-share.

779
00:39:14,271 --> 00:39:16,918
So Fiji... we can either
go at the end of this month

780
00:39:16,919 --> 00:39:18,553
or we could save up three weeks of time

781
00:39:18,554 --> 00:39:19,570
and rearrange our surgical schedules

782
00:39:19,571 --> 00:39:21,022
and go at the end of next month.

783
00:39:21,023 --> 00:39:23,699
Try as we might to keep
from feeling pain...

784
00:39:24,759 --> 00:39:25,836
What's that?

785
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:29,346
This cute girl's number.

786
00:39:29,347 --> 00:39:31,178
And I can't get it off.

787
00:39:31,179 --> 00:39:32,695
And...

788
00:39:32,696 --> 00:39:35,095
I'm... I'm not gonna use
it. I don't want to use it.

789
00:39:37,362 --> 00:39:39,802
But I... I can't stop wondering

790
00:39:39,803 --> 00:39:41,927
if maybe she wants a baby one day.

791
00:39:51,659 --> 00:39:53,444
I love you...

792
00:39:55,819 --> 00:39:57,407
Everything about you.

793
00:39:58,779 --> 00:40:01,744
But there's this one thing that I need,

794
00:40:01,745 --> 00:40:04,542
and I can't change it and
I can't ask you to change.

795
00:40:04,543 --> 00:40:07,388
- I don't want you to change.
- And I can't be the one

796
00:40:07,389 --> 00:40:09,569
that keeps you from having a baby.

797
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:19,214
I love you, too.

798
00:40:22,866 --> 00:40:25,384
And we can keep going...

799
00:40:25,385 --> 00:40:27,076
but I don't know where we're going.

800
00:40:30,759 --> 00:40:32,198
Come here.

801
00:40:40,917 --> 00:40:43,143
Sometimes, it's just unavoidable.

802
00:40:44,308 --> 00:40:46,812
Oh, God. What are we gonna do?

803
00:40:50,689 --> 00:40:53,138
Well, I'm gonna get my stuff together.

804
00:40:54,566 --> 00:40:55,974
Oh.

805
00:40:59,341 --> 00:41:01,150
And what, we'll just...

806
00:41:02,625 --> 00:41:04,525
We'll see each other at work.

807
00:41:06,834 --> 00:41:08,764
I'm so sorry.

808
00:41:09,698 --> 00:41:10,978
I love you.

809
00:41:12,674 --> 00:41:14,992
Me, too. Me, too.

810
00:41:16,671 --> 00:41:18,122
Sometimes...

811
00:41:18,123 --> 00:41:20,356
That's the only thing left..

812
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:37,491
Thanks. This was a good idea.

813
00:41:37,492 --> 00:41:38,710
No talking.

814
00:41:45,699 --> 00:41:46,802
Oh!

815
00:41:47,824 --> 00:41:49,954
- You shanked it.
- No talking.

816
00:41:56,988 --> 00:41:58,517
Just feeling.
