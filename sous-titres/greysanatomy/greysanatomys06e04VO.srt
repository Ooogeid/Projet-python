1
00:00:09,686 --> 00:00:11,587
<i>We pledge allegiance
fusto the flag.</i>

2
00:00:11,654 --> 00:00:15,090
<i>We swear to return
our library books.</i>

3
00:00:15,158 --> 00:00:17,459
<i>But as we get older,
we take vows,</i>

4
00:00:17,527 --> 00:00:19,228
<i>We make promises,</i>

5
00:00:19,295 --> 00:00:21,530
<i>We get burdened
by commitments--</i>

6
00:00:21,598 --> 00:00:24,967
<i>To do no harm, to tell
the truth and nothing but,</i>

7
00:00:25,034 --> 00:00:29,004
<i>To love and cherish
till death do us part.</i>

8
00:00:29,072 --> 00:00:31,373
<i>So we just keep
running up a tab</i>

9
00:00:31,441 --> 00:00:34,309
<i>Until we owe everything
to everybody,</i>

10
00:00:34,377 --> 00:00:37,513
<i>And suddenly think,
what the...</i>

11
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,282
Aah!
(growls)

12
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,751
Aah!
Are you sure it was a bear
and not a deer?

13
00:00:42,819 --> 00:00:45,254
There are a lot of deer
in those woods,

14
00:00:45,321 --> 00:00:48,290
And the bucks can get
pretty big.
I think I know the difference
between a bear and a deer.

15
00:00:48,358 --> 00:00:51,226
Rest, ice and elevate,
okay?
You know how--you know
how I got to the car?

16
00:00:51,294 --> 00:00:54,196
I had to throw a raw steak
and run for my life.

17
00:00:54,264 --> 00:00:56,165
That was a 10-ounce filet.

18
00:00:56,232 --> 00:00:58,133
I've been marinating it
for three days.

19
00:00:58,201 --> 00:01:01,737
We have to move!
Where? We barely make
30 grand a year.

20
00:01:01,805 --> 00:01:04,473
And who knows if we're even
gonna have a job

21
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:06,508
After the merger?
We could move
back to meredith's.

22
00:01:06,576 --> 00:01:08,477
You did not just say that?
Why not?!

23
00:01:08,545 --> 00:01:11,914
Because we're married now. This
is how it's supposed to be--

24
00:01:11,981 --> 00:01:14,850
You and me out in the world,
making a life for ourselves.

25
00:01:14,918 --> 00:01:17,820
Besides, don't you just enjoy
waking up to the fresh air

26
00:01:17,887 --> 00:01:20,489
And the sounds
of birds chirping?
You know what I enjoy?

27
00:01:20,557 --> 00:01:24,159
I enjoy plumbing.
I enjoy plumbing so much!

28
00:01:28,447 --> 00:01:30,065
It's not that I don't
love it at mer's. I do.

29
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,934
It's just... I just--
I can't move backwards, alex.

30
00:01:32,001 --> 00:01:34,236
Not after
everything that's...

31
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,401
I just need
to keep moving forward.

32
00:01:39,436 --> 00:01:40,242
Okay?

33
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,044
Thank you.

34
00:01:43,533 --> 00:01:46,227
I know it hasn't exactly
been easy around here

35
00:01:46,342 --> 00:01:47,491
The past few weeks.

36
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:50,042
And I know you want answers.

37
00:01:50,634 --> 00:01:51,808
But I'm afraid
I don't have them,

38
00:01:52,271 --> 00:01:55,815
Not just yet...
He brought us down here
to make himself feel good.

39
00:01:56,194 --> 00:01:59,961
Well, at least he sprung
for good danish.
You know how many nurses
got fired for that danish?

40
00:02:00,506 --> 00:02:02,520
The mercy west staff
will be arriving in three days,

41
00:02:02,626 --> 00:02:03,306
And when they do,

42
00:02:03,413 --> 00:02:05,852
There will be more cutbacks
and more layoffs.

43
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:08,347
And I need
each and every one of you

44
00:02:08,482 --> 00:02:10,002
To step up and be leaders.

45
00:02:10,492 --> 00:02:12,229
And when I can answer
your questions, I will.

46
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,530
(doctors talking at once)
if you would like to make
an appointment

47
00:02:20,186 --> 00:02:22,658
To talk about your concerns--
(nelson) is my hyperbaric lab
getting shut down?

48
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:25,791
You were right.
Excellent danish.

49
00:02:31,065 --> 00:02:31,933
Anything?

50
00:02:32,472 --> 00:02:35,026
Nope. There was a papillary
muscle rupture in the c.C.U.,

51
00:02:35,143 --> 00:02:36,919
But the guy died before they
uld get him into the o.R.

52
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:39,329
Crap. I need surgeries,
and I need them now.

53
00:02:39,531 --> 00:02:41,679
I mean, I barely had a hundred
hours in the o.R. This month.

54
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,398
And you know they're gonna
keep the residents

55
00:02:43,466 --> 00:02:44,568
With the most hours.

56
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:51,085
What dyou got?
Um, diabetic ulcer.

57
00:02:51,318 --> 00:02:52,515
Down to the bone?

58
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm done.

59
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:57,171
Finished. Expired meat.

60
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:00,078
You're freaking out
a little bit.
Well, you haven't been

61
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,648
Kicked off
of two services in one month.

62
00:03:01,936 --> 00:03:04,084
I couldn't get into an o.R.
If I was bleeding half to death.

63
00:03:04,243 --> 00:03:06,586
You got anything good?
I'm scrubbing in
on an optic glioma

64
00:03:06,766 --> 00:03:08,901
Later on with derek.
I've never seen one.

65
00:03:14,914 --> 00:03:16,519
What are you doing?

66
00:03:17,001 --> 00:03:18,979
Just making sure everything
is running smoothly here.

67
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:20,438
And... It is.

68
00:03:20,723 --> 00:03:21,958
Kudos.

69
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:25,744
Oh, no, no, no. Unh-unh.
No. I am on hunt's service.

70
00:03:25,861 --> 00:03:28,374
Anything that turnsurgical
down here is mine.
You don't need the hours.

71
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,506
You just spent the last
six months in the o.R.
Unconscious on a table
does not count.

72
00:03:32,777 --> 00:03:33,596
(lexie) meredith.

73
00:03:33,823 --> 00:03:35,881
Hey, his neighbor said that
he wasn't getting his mail.

74
00:03:36,146 --> 00:03:39,015
(slurring words) mer-meredith,
oh, I heard you got...

75
00:03:39,421 --> 00:03:41,970
You got married
on a sticker.

76
00:03:42,334 --> 00:03:44,317
That's great.
(cristina) you know,
we should go

77
00:03:44,393 --> 00:03:46,995
So you can have family time.
No, no, no. I don't know
what's wrong with him.

78
00:03:47,292 --> 00:03:49,355
Did you pick him up
off the floor of a bar, lexie?

79
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,521
That might be a clue.
Meredith, no, I'm not...

80
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:53,922
I haven't been drinking.
I swear.

81
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:04,497
Now that could be surgical.

82
00:04:12,738 --> 00:04:15,817
Okay, make sure his fluids
are running wide open.

83
00:04:16,081 --> 00:04:17,095
Let's get that blood hung.

84
00:04:19,372 --> 00:04:20,341
What--
what about factor 7?

85
00:04:20,431 --> 00:04:22,662
Did you check his I.N.R.?
Okay, hang 50 mics
of octreotide.

86
00:04:22,814 --> 00:04:24,978
(izzie) got it.
Dr. Bailey, shouldn't we
check for renal failure?

87
00:04:25,235 --> 00:04:27,209
Move. I need to lavage him.
No, I need to put this up.

88
00:04:27,313 --> 00:04:30,542
Okay, hey, pause. There's
way too many people here.

89
00:04:31,155 --> 00:04:35,026
Karev, get the orogastric
tube in. The rest of you, out.

90
00:04:35,237 --> 00:04:37,660
No, wait a minute.
I'm in emergency!
But I was here first.

91
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:41,167
He made amends.
He's not drunk.

92
00:04:47,826 --> 00:04:50,159
All right, irving,
I'm taking off the growth.

93
00:04:50,311 --> 00:04:51,419
Let me know
if you feel any pain.

94
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:52,806
He gets so many of these.

95
00:04:53,241 --> 00:04:54,809
We should have
the nursing home examine him

96
00:04:55,133 --> 00:04:57,126
When they bathe him.
I bathe myself.

97
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:01,513
Of course you do, irving.
He could fall in the tub.

98
00:05:01,764 --> 00:05:04,302
Why don't you two
go get me a cup of coffee?

99
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:05,974
You already had a cup, dad.

100
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,245
Too much isn't good
for your ticker.

101
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,802
Well, he can have
decaf, tommy.

102
00:05:11,048 --> 00:05:13,807
We'll go get you
a nice cup of decaf.

103
00:05:14,119 --> 00:05:15,102
Thank you, sweetie.

104
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:18,622
You know, I'm not demented.
I'm just old.

105
00:05:23,792 --> 00:05:24,963
(sighs)
all right, uh, mr. Waller.
All done.

106
00:05:25,187 --> 00:05:26,777
All done.
There might be
a little redness,

107
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:28,235
But it should heal up nicely.

108
00:05:28,491 --> 00:05:29,497
Got it?

109
00:05:29,931 --> 00:05:32,768
I've had these skin things
for 30 years. I'm not worried.

110
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:38,173
What I'm really here for
is an a-m-s 700.

111
00:05:38,367 --> 00:05:41,474
The, uh, penile implant?

112
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:44,034
Yeah.
Well, usually the first step

113
00:05:44,204 --> 00:05:46,616
In treating erectile
dysfunction's drug therapy.

114
00:05:46,782 --> 00:05:47,684
I can, uh,

115
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,802
If you're having symptoms,
write you a prescription.

116
00:05:49,957 --> 00:05:51,955
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I took those pills years ago.

117
00:05:52,206 --> 00:05:54,126
They never even gave me
a liftoff.

118
00:05:54,572 --> 00:05:56,862
And then my wife died,
and I gave up.

119
00:05:57,391 --> 00:06:01,425
But... I'm seeing
this new gal

120
00:06:01,571 --> 00:06:02,704
From the east wing.

121
00:06:02,966 --> 00:06:04,603
Uh, she's a younger woman,
and...

122
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:07,411
I don't want to disappoint.

123
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,370
I understand.

124
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:13,841
But it is
a surgical procedure,

125
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:17,666
So... There is a question
of safety, given your age.

126
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,038
My age.

127
00:06:19,252 --> 00:06:20,318
It's always my age.

128
00:06:21,671 --> 00:06:24,094
Ah. The golden years.

129
00:06:24,607 --> 00:06:27,186
Let me tell you about
the golden years, doc.

130
00:06:28,146 --> 00:06:30,132
There's just gotta be
more to life

131
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:33,516
Than eating pudding
and watching "csi."

132
00:06:34,092 --> 00:06:35,085
Now come on.

133
00:06:35,567 --> 00:06:37,923
Can you give an old man
a working johnson?

134
00:06:38,174 --> 00:06:38,723
(chuckles)

135
00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:47,380
Did I tell you
how great your hair looks?

136
00:06:47,547 --> 00:06:50,735
It's all just short
and, um, edgy.

137
00:06:51,122 --> 00:06:53,380
Wow, you are
really tweaking out.

138
00:06:53,838 --> 00:06:56,823
How long has it been
since you've cut?
Over a week.

139
00:06:57,157 --> 00:07:00,058
Ooh.
Stevens, I have something
for you if you're interested.

140
00:07:00,426 --> 00:07:01,459
Well, I'm interested.

141
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:03,609
Uh, an m.V.C. Came in
a while back.

142
00:07:03,783 --> 00:07:05,744
During his workup, I found
an abdominal sarcoma.

143
00:07:05,917 --> 00:07:07,511
Since then, I've been
following his recurrences,

144
00:07:07,711 --> 00:07:10,644
And, uh, he came back today
with his third one.

145
00:07:11,045 --> 00:07:14,245
Wondered if you could scrub in
if you feel ready.
I'm ready.

146
00:07:14,383 --> 00:07:15,743
I'm ready.
He's in pre-op.

147
00:07:19,963 --> 00:07:21,242
You know
I need a surgery.

148
00:07:21,534 --> 00:07:22,839
And you know
I don't play favorites.

149
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:25,015
People have been afraid
to work with stevens.

150
00:07:25,092 --> 00:07:27,418
It's like she's gonna break
or something. It's not right.

151
00:07:27,565 --> 00:07:30,057
She is a good surgeon
and she has a way with patients

152
00:07:31,365 --> 00:07:33,081
And a light touch.
You want nice?

153
00:07:33,612 --> 00:07:34,928
I can be nice
to a dying husk.

154
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,332
Yeah.
N-not a light touch.

155
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:43,042
My dad's dead. At first
I thought he was drunk,

156
00:07:43,228 --> 00:07:44,701
Then he started
puking blood.

157
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:46,115
And puking blood
and disorientation

158
00:07:46,388 --> 00:07:48,251
Usually means...
End-stage liver failure.

159
00:07:48,512 --> 00:07:49,941
Which means
he's probably dead by now

160
00:07:50,307 --> 00:07:52,853
Or he needs a transplant,
and I hope he's not a candidate,

161
00:07:53,035 --> 00:07:55,013
Because that means he'd be
in the hospital for months.

162
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:57,717
Uh, mer.

163
00:07:58,799 --> 00:08:00,689
He needs a transplant,
doesn't he?

164
00:08:01,234 --> 00:08:01,858
(alex) yeah.

165
00:08:06,963 --> 00:08:09,034
You've got end-stage
cirrhosis.

166
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,741
We can treat the symptoms,
but the only thing

167
00:08:12,052 --> 00:08:15,599
That can save your life
is a transplant.
How did it happen this fast?

168
00:08:15,853 --> 00:08:17,406
He bathed it in gin.

169
00:08:17,657 --> 00:08:19,631
(lexie) alex.
(thatcher) no,
your friend's right.

170
00:08:19,923 --> 00:08:21,963
Except for the gin.
I was a scotch man.

171
00:08:23,713 --> 00:08:26,007
What's--
what's the next step here?

172
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:27,657
Do I get on a list?

173
00:08:28,114 --> 00:08:30,223
Um, thatcher,
the transplant board

174
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,474
Has a rule here.

175
00:08:31,686 --> 00:08:33,766
An alcoholic has to be sober
at least a year

176
00:08:33,927 --> 00:08:35,626
Before he qualifies
for a donor liver.

177
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,888
I'm only 90 days.

178
00:08:43,131 --> 00:08:44,273
I'll do it.

179
00:08:44,907 --> 00:08:46,899
I'll do it today. I'll--
I'll go get tested right now.

180
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:51,265
(thatcher) lexie--
no, they just take a piece.
My liver will regenerate.

181
00:08:51,512 --> 00:08:53,111
I can't ask you
to do something like that.

182
00:08:53,285 --> 00:08:55,473
It's... It's major surgery.

183
00:08:55,762 --> 00:08:57,098
You're not asking.

184
00:08:57,794 --> 00:08:58,937
You're my dad.

185
00:08:59,721 --> 00:09:01,420
You want a kidney? I'll throw in
one of those, too.

186
00:09:01,706 --> 00:09:02,443
(sighs)

187
00:09:06,064 --> 00:09:07,408
One more time.
You be the chief.

188
00:09:07,569 --> 00:09:09,145
You're all cranky
and, uh, in a bad mood.

189
00:09:09,275 --> 00:09:11,740
And I'll be callie
asking for her job back.
You are callie.

190
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,431
Right. So it works.
You said that yesterday,
and the day before that

191
00:09:15,534 --> 00:09:17,008
And the day before
the day before that.

192
00:09:17,329 --> 00:09:19,858
So are you gonna do this?
Hey, it is not easy
to ask for your job back

193
00:09:19,971 --> 00:09:21,489
After you told your boss
to go screw himself

194
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:22,992
In front of
his entire hospital.

195
00:09:23,122 --> 00:09:25,001
It's humiliating.
So you're not gonna do it.

196
00:09:25,722 --> 00:09:27,583
What--what is the point?
He already fired me once.

197
00:09:27,755 --> 00:09:30,289
He's not gonna hire me back now
just because of the merger.

198
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,410
Whatever. Maybe being
a surgeon's overrated.

199
00:09:33,393 --> 00:09:34,442
I'd be happy
doing lots of things.

200
00:09:34,682 --> 00:09:36,796
I could open a daycare.
Babies are cute.

201
00:09:38,025 --> 00:09:40,880
Ew. That one just spit.
Calliope torres,
I don't want you to have to

202
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:45,063
Move to cleveland
to be a surgeon.
(sighs)
okay, I'm gonna do it.

203
00:09:45,187 --> 00:09:46,450
(pager beeps)
oh.

204
00:09:48,037 --> 00:09:50,138
Later?
But I-I will come back later.

205
00:09:53,113 --> 00:09:54,597
(mutters) my girlfriend's
moving to cleveland.

206
00:09:55,109 --> 00:09:56,363
(babbles)
yep. Yep.

207
00:09:58,415 --> 00:10:00,403
Look at you.
Coming in on your day off.

208
00:10:01,049 --> 00:10:02,412
Trying to get in
to the o.R.?

209
00:10:02,718 --> 00:10:04,504
Yeah. I'm gonna give my dad
a piece of my liver.

210
00:10:04,785 --> 00:10:06,553
End-stage liver disease.
He needs my liver.

211
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,035
I'm giving him some.
Go ahead, steve.
Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.

212
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:12,324
What is your problem?
Well, my problem is,
you don't just jump in

213
00:10:12,717 --> 00:10:14,482
To something like this
without thinking about it.

214
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:17,335
Take a couple days.
We'll--we'll talk.
What is there to talk about?

215
00:10:17,555 --> 00:10:20,717
It's major,
life-threatening surgery.
Okay, my dad needs
a transplant, mark.

216
00:10:20,935 --> 00:10:23,762
I get that, but what
you need to understand--
no, I don't think
you get it at all.

217
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,476
You know
what I don't get?

218
00:10:26,616 --> 00:10:29,188
We're together.
We live together.

219
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,875
We need to decide
these things together.

220
00:10:32,483 --> 00:10:35,617
You can't just go under
the knife and leave me a note.
No, I-I would've paged you.

221
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,640
I'm your boyfriend, grey.

222
00:10:37,776 --> 00:10:39,143
He's my dad.

223
00:10:43,299 --> 00:10:44,348
Okay. A little pinch.

224
00:10:49,673 --> 00:10:52,824
Oh. I cannot get
this stupid thing to work.

225
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,460
Try knocking it on something.

226
00:10:59,266 --> 00:11:00,148
(tv clicks on)

227
00:11:00,263 --> 00:11:01,647
<i>(woman) excuse me.
Insider trick.</i>

228
00:11:01,854 --> 00:11:03,122
What other tricks you know?

229
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:04,977
Well, stay away
from the lime jell-o.

230
00:11:05,419 --> 00:11:07,308
And if you want the good meds,
tell 'em you have a headache,

231
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,327
Not a stomachache.

232
00:11:08,479 --> 00:11:10,425
Oh, d if your arm starts to
hurt from all the needle pokes,

233
00:11:10,555 --> 00:11:12,439
Tell 'em you want that
anesthetic cream. It numbs it.

234
00:11:12,578 --> 00:11:15,177
You've done this before.
Stage iv melanoma.

235
00:11:16,713 --> 00:11:17,821
Um, mrs. Helsby,

236
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:19,517
I'm gonna have to give him
a rectal exam.

237
00:11:19,598 --> 00:11:21,998
So you may want to leave
the room for this.  Oh,-
I'm not his wife. (laughs)

238
00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:25,096
What's that saying--
uh, they won't buy the cow

239
00:11:25,177 --> 00:11:26,925
If you give 'em
the milk for free?

240
00:11:27,075 --> 00:11:30,307
Yeah, we're working on
eight years of free milk.

241
00:11:30,417 --> 00:11:32,494
Hey, I was gonna propose
last year, but I got distracted

242
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,416
By this little thing
called cancer.
You got the best excuse
in the book.

243
00:11:36,557 --> 00:11:37,779
(izzie laughs) nice.

244
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:42,039
<i>(man speindistinctly
on tv)</i>

245
00:11:42,112 --> 00:11:43,547
The ring's at home
in the mouth guard container,

246
00:11:43,772 --> 00:11:44,706
All right?

247
00:11:44,832 --> 00:11:46,237
I'm just waiting
for the right moment.

248
00:11:47,217 --> 00:11:49,354
What we'd do
is we'd surgically place

249
00:11:49,454 --> 00:11:51,813
The silicone implant
into the penis,

250
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:54,050
And when the pump is squeezed
before intercourse--

251
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,832
Where does the pump go?
In the scrotum.

252
00:11:56,937 --> 00:11:59,394
So to pump it up,
I just squeeze the jewels?

253
00:11:59,493 --> 00:12:03,229
Dad. (laughs) dad.
It's--it's--it's ridiculous.

254
00:12:03,403 --> 00:12:04,924
You're 82 years old.

255
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:07,588
So? I shouldn't have
a sex life?

256
00:12:07,698 --> 00:12:10,571
Go on, doc. You're just
getting to the good part.

257
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:13,495
No, no, listen to me.
This is major surgery.

258
00:12:13,597 --> 00:12:14,693
They have to cut your...

259
00:12:15,629 --> 00:12:17,299
They cut you open, dad.
You could bleed or...

260
00:12:17,386 --> 00:12:20,560
You want to die, huh,
over an erection?

261
00:12:20,778 --> 00:12:22,959
Wars have been fought
over an erection, son.

262
00:12:23,064 --> 00:12:26,406
(woman) irving, I'm--I'm sure
that a-a thing like this

263
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:28,562
Isn't covered by medicare.
Oh, brother.

264
00:12:29,362 --> 00:12:30,449
And I know you don't want
to use your savings,

265
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:32,113
'cause you're gonna want
to help janey pay for college.

266
00:12:32,654 --> 00:12:34,077
Sweetheart, I love janey.

267
00:12:34,798 --> 00:12:38,342
But let's stop pretending
she's going to college.

268
00:12:38,908 --> 00:12:39,843
She's pretty,

269
00:12:40,006 --> 00:12:41,846
But she's not too sharp.

270
00:12:42,038 --> 00:12:44,584
Dad.
Tom, this is my money.

271
00:12:44,734 --> 00:12:46,287
This is the way
I want to spend it.

272
00:12:46,442 --> 00:12:48,352
Your mother and I saved
our entire lives

273
00:12:48,452 --> 00:12:50,915
For what she called
"a rainy day."

274
00:12:52,145 --> 00:12:54,530
And then she died before
we could spend one cent.

275
00:12:54,793 --> 00:12:56,142
I think your mother
would be proud

276
00:12:56,227 --> 00:12:58,340
That I'm finally doing
something nice for myself.

277
00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:01,337
You think mom would be proud
you're getting a penis pump?
(mark) okay.

278
00:13:01,472 --> 00:13:02,986
We're gonna have to run
some tests.

279
00:13:03,164 --> 00:13:05,413
We might not even know
if the surgery is an option.

280
00:13:06,378 --> 00:13:08,837
So why don't we all
just calm down,

281
00:13:11,139 --> 00:13:12,085
Start from there?

282
00:13:20,943 --> 00:13:22,949
Hey, whatcha lookin' for?

283
00:13:23,741 --> 00:13:24,809
Excuse me?

284
00:13:24,977 --> 00:13:26,304
Oh, I-I couldn't help
but notice, uh,

285
00:13:26,687 --> 00:13:29,455
You have no resident on your
decompressive laminectomy.

286
00:13:29,524 --> 00:13:32,035
Well, today's your lucky day,
'cause I'm available.

287
00:13:33,181 --> 00:13:34,709
Yang, right?
Mm-hmm.

288
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:36,547
I-I heard you were
hard-core into cardio.

289
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,769
I can be hard-core
into anything you want.

290
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,269
Are you whoring yourself
out for surgeries?

291
00:13:48,347 --> 00:13:49,712
Oh, shut up.
You forced me into it.

292
00:13:50,356 --> 00:13:52,614
Biology--it's crap,
utter crap.

293
00:13:52,697 --> 00:13:55,752
D.N.A., r.N.A.--Doesn't make
someone your family.

294
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:57,895
It does, actually.

295
00:13:58,153 --> 00:13:59,425
He needs a liver transplant.

296
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:02,077
Lexie volunteered like she
just got asked for a $1 bill.

297
00:14:02,163 --> 00:14:05,691
I left the room.
He's not my father.
Wait, your dad
needs a transplant?

298
00:14:06,026 --> 00:14:08,286
(pager beeps)
ooh. Maybe not.
Maybe he's dead this time.

299
00:14:13,141 --> 00:14:13,936
(owen) ah, damn it.

300
00:14:14,335 --> 00:14:16,317
It's worse than I thought.

301
00:14:16,599 --> 00:14:19,169
The scarring's completely
fused his organs together.

302
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:21,667
God, it looks like

303
00:14:21,724 --> 00:14:23,274
Somebody poured
a bottle of glue down there.

304
00:14:23,371 --> 00:14:24,485
How do we fix it?

305
00:14:27,054 --> 00:14:27,953
We don't.

306
00:14:30,798 --> 00:14:31,841
If we could
just to the cancer,

307
00:14:31,924 --> 00:14:33,322
I think we could get
clean margins.

308
00:14:33,427 --> 00:14:34,471
With this many adhesions,

309
00:14:34,555 --> 00:14:36,789
The risk of tumor rupture--
it's too high.

310
00:14:36,828 --> 00:14:39,456
We cut into him again, we're
doing more harm than good.

311
00:14:39,481 --> 00:14:40,606
But maybe if we just--

312
00:14:40,677 --> 00:14:42,936
We have to know
when to say when, stevens.

313
00:14:43,004 --> 00:14:44,629
And I'm saying when.

00:14:55,389 --> 00:14:56,360
Oh.

317
00:14:56,524 --> 00:14:59,397
We rushed dr. Grey's labs.
She wasn't a match.

00:15:00,478 --> 00:15:02,322
Oh. Okay.

Yeah.

322
00:15:10,472 --> 00:15:12,633
She lives on an army base
with her husband in bahrain.

323
00:15:12,721 --> 00:15:14,505
Um, plus, she has a history
of d.V.T.,

324
00:15:14,598 --> 00:15:17,235
So she can't be a donor.
Oh.

325
00:15:17,621 --> 00:15:20,407
(richard) meredith,
we didn't call you here to...

326
00:15:21,316 --> 00:15:22,426
W-we thought
you should know

327
00:15:22,538 --> 00:15:24,462
Before we go in and tell him,
just in case.

328
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:28,177
Right. Right. No, thank you
for keeping me in the loop.

329
00:15:28,329 --> 00:15:31,048
Thank you. I, um, have to go
prep for my surgery now.

330
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:32,455
Okay.

331
00:15:40,711 --> 00:15:41,994
Why are we eating lunch

332
00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:45,520
<i>In a room
full of diseased organs?
(meredith) we are hiding
from lexie</i>

333
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,790
And her big, sad
"I love my daddy" eyes,

334
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:51,781
<i>Because I can't take it
anymore.
Wait, is little grey
not a match?</i>

335
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:54,082
Oh, damn.
There goes my transplant.

336
00:15:54,163 --> 00:15:56,373
Nice try.
It was my transplant.
Are you gonna get tested, me

337
00:15:56,472 --> 00:15:57,816
No. Barely know the guy.

338
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,006
You might as well
just get tested.

339
00:16:02,243 --> 00:16:04,407
You could regret it
if you don't do it.
He might be
a drunk deadbeat,

340
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:06,444
But he gave you
the ultimate gift.
Yeah, the gift of life.

341
00:16:06,663 --> 00:16:09,945
(laughs) you guys are sick.
You really are. You're sick.

342
00:16:10,092 --> 00:16:13,490
Don't listen to them, mer.
They just want a surgery.
Mama needs to cut.

343
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,691
Babe, you got some dirt
on your neck. Right there.

344
00:16:19,015 --> 00:16:22,998
That's not dirt.
At's a tick. Ew.

345
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,541
Get it--get it off me.
Oh, is that a tick?

346
00:16:24,601 --> 00:16:25,849
It is a tick.
It's a tick.

347
00:16:25,936 --> 00:16:27,829
Look at it.
It's all swollen.
Get it off me now, please.

348
00:16:27,877 --> 00:16:30,253
It's having lunch, too.
Get it off me! Get it
off of me right now!

349
00:16:30,305 --> 00:16:31,859
(izzie and meredith
shouting indistinctly)
get it! Get it!
Somebody, take it off!

350
00:16:34,344 --> 00:16:36,133
You know, the kids think
this is all vanity.

351
00:16:36,223 --> 00:16:38,796
But I really need
this surgery, doc.

352
00:16:39,137 --> 00:16:40,574
Well, if she loves you,

353
00:16:40,597 --> 00:16:43,527
She'll understand
if you can't... Perform.

354
00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:46,031
Cuddling nice, too.

355
00:16:46,231 --> 00:16:47,632
You know,
you're just a kid, doc.

356
00:16:47,722 --> 00:16:48,941
You won't understand.

357
00:16:49,028 --> 00:16:51,103
But one day,
you're gonna wake up

358
00:16:52,002 --> 00:16:53,185
And all the big stuff,

359
00:16:53,271 --> 00:16:55,620
All the milestones you've been
looking forward to--

360
00:16:55,719 --> 00:17:00,426
Graduation, wedding,
having kids, your grandkids--

361
00:17:01,573 --> 00:17:03,096
It's all behind you.

362
00:17:04,098 --> 00:17:05,392
It's all over.

363
00:17:06,858 --> 00:17:08,597
All you got
is a bunch of yesterdays

364
00:17:09,332 --> 00:17:11,316
And very few tomorrows.

365
00:17:12,803 --> 00:17:14,283
I haven't wanted
to make love with a woman

366
00:17:14,346 --> 00:17:16,575
Since sylvie died
over 20 years ago.

367
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:18,326
And then one night...

368
00:17:19,964 --> 00:17:21,283
One night...

369
00:17:21,677 --> 00:17:23,385
They sat me down
at the bingo table

370
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,683
With marion.

371
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:28,043
And you just knew.

372
00:17:29,303 --> 00:17:31,103
She's my tomorrow.

373
00:17:41,581 --> 00:17:42,738
He's still sleeping.

374
00:17:42,842 --> 00:17:44,124
Good.
He needs his rest.

375
00:17:44,199 --> 00:17:46,724
Dr. Ey, I, um,
I-I was wondering if--

376
00:17:46,782 --> 00:17:48,200
If you could lie,

377
00:17:48,269 --> 00:17:51,406
If--if you could lie
to the transplant board

378
00:17:51,534 --> 00:17:53,597
And--and tell them that
he's been sober for a year.

379
00:17:54,275 --> 00:17:55,879
Um, they trust you.
They'll listen to you.

380
00:17:58,252 --> 00:17:58,643
And--and maybe then he could--
he could get on the list.

381
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:00,618
Dr. Grey,
I have 15 other patients

382
00:18:00,688 --> 00:18:02,230
All waiting
for liver transplants--

383
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,382
15 people
in an untenable situation,

384
00:18:05,463 --> 00:18:08,054
None of whom
drank themselves into it.

385
00:18:08,143 --> 00:18:11,912
So, no, I will not lie,
not for you, not for anyone.

386
00:18:11,963 --> 00:18:13,281
Do you have
any other questions

387
00:18:13,385 --> 00:18:14,417
I can answer?

388
00:18:17,175 --> 00:18:21,125
How would you like it--
things crawling all over you,

389
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:24,623
Stupid squirrels having a party
alnight on your roof?

390
00:18:24,841 --> 00:18:26,706
I mean, what the hell are they
doing up there anyway?

391
00:18:26,821 --> 00:18:29,084
Applying betadine to the area.
I don't know
how to deal with this.

392
00:18:29,851 --> 00:18:32,522
I mean, I don't camp.
My parents were lounge lizards.

393
00:18:32,966 --> 00:18:34,504
I was raised in a bar.
Extracting the arachnid.

394
00:18:35,417 --> 00:18:38,490
And then there's no plumbing.
I mean, the--the toilet?

395
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,630
It empties into a bucket
underneath the trailer.

396
00:18:40,925 --> 00:18:43,743
A crap bucket! And izzie's all,
"marriage is an adventure,

397
00:18:43,851 --> 00:18:46,640
Just the two of us,
exploring the wild."

398
00:18:47,412 --> 00:18:50,527
I married
freakin' lewis and clark.
Well, I guess I'm done.

399
00:18:50,851 --> 00:18:51,558
That's it.

400
00:18:51,575 --> 00:18:53,793
I mean, I'm--I'm telling her,
we're moving back to meredith's.

401
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,230
I'm done.
You can't do that.

402
00:18:57,984 --> 00:19:00,555
Why not?
Because that's not
how it works.

403
00:19:00,742 --> 00:19:02,277
I mean, she's just
been through hell.

404
00:19:02,382 --> 00:19:06,813
She's not okay yet.
Just give her one, alex.
Since when did you
become a marriage counselor?

405
00:19:07,626 --> 00:19:09,352
I guess when you save
someone's life,

406
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,807
You kinda want it
not to suck.

407
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:16,376
You know, I hate when
people who don't live here

408
00:19:16,451 --> 00:19:18,427
Say that seattle weather sucks.
Those people suck.

409
00:19:19,374 --> 00:19:21,531
Ooh. I wanted to show you
something. I made a list.

410
00:19:21,863 --> 00:19:24,771
Hmm. You made a list?
Yeah, to read to the chief.

411
00:19:24,966 --> 00:19:27,080
50 reasons why you should
hire me as an attending.

412
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,668
Okay, number one,

413
00:19:28,886 --> 00:19:30,908
I built a man's bones
out of titanium rods.

414
00:19:31,265 --> 00:19:34,091
Two, what I lack in experience,
I make up for in raw talent.

415
00:19:34,161 --> 00:19:36,456
Three, I can go seven hours
in the o.R.

416
00:19:36,569 --> 00:19:37,738
Without even taking
a pee break.

417
00:19:37,848 --> 00:19:40,117
Four... What are you doing?

418
00:19:40,292 --> 00:19:41,633
I'm going back
to the hospital.

419
00:19:41,753 --> 00:19:43,610
Uh, this is important.

420
00:19:46,617 --> 00:19:48,943
I lost my favorite scrub nurse
yesterday.

421
00:19:49,349 --> 00:19:51,182
Anne--
she's a single mother.

422
00:19:51,255 --> 00:19:55,313
She's supporting three kids,
and now she's out of a job.

423
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,762
And this morning,
a 10 month old hemorrhaged

424
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:58,829
While I was deep in her chest,

425
00:19:58,886 --> 00:20:00,475
And I didn't have
my favorite scrub nurse.

426
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:04,345
I had to actually look up
and ask for a mesh wrap

427
00:20:04,472 --> 00:20:05,932
Because the new nurse
didn't know me

428
00:20:06,714 --> 00:20:09,118
Anne knew all my moves
before I even made 'em.

429
00:20:10,532 --> 00:20:12,943
And it felt terrible to be
in the o.R. Without her.

430
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,576
I was really looking forward

431
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,534
To spending 30 minutes
in the park with my girlfriend.

432
00:20:19,201 --> 00:20:21,424
'cause this merger thing?
It's important to all of us.

433
00:20:23,873 --> 00:20:26,510
Sorry.
I've been... Just...

434
00:20:28,282 --> 00:20:29,444
Sorry.

435
00:20:33,428 --> 00:20:36,225
He'll say yes
or he'll say no.

436
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:37,578
(exhales deeply)

437
00:20:37,689 --> 00:20:39,128
And then we'll know.

438
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,373
Okay.

439
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:50,794
This our optic glioma guy?

440
00:20:51,148 --> 00:20:52,843
Mm-hmm. Are you sure
you're up for this?

441
00:20:53,137 --> 00:20:56,191
There'll be others.
I promise.
Yeah, you know,

442
00:20:56,314 --> 00:20:58,895
Everyone is looking at me
like I owe him something,

443
00:20:58,996 --> 00:21:01,181
But he's still
the bad guy here.
You don't owe him anything.

444
00:21:06,746 --> 00:21:07,964
I...

445
00:21:10,884 --> 00:21:12,338
So I'm gonna be fired.

446
00:21:13,407 --> 00:21:15,133
I've done a lot
of really dumb things today,

447
00:21:15,421 --> 00:21:18,101
Including pulling
your medical files.

448
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:19,530
Lexie--

449
00:21:19,629 --> 00:21:21,723
Just listen.
I didn't want to do this.

450
00:21:22,162 --> 00:21:23,560
I didn't want
to have to come to you

451
00:21:23,798 --> 00:21:25,112
For anything, ever.

452
00:21:25,591 --> 00:21:28,566
So I thought if I looked up
your blood type

453
00:21:29,506 --> 00:21:32,109
And it was the wrong one,
then that would be it,

454
00:21:32,482 --> 00:21:34,540
Then I could
just stop thinking about it.

455
00:21:34,863 --> 00:21:36,346
But I can't,

456
00:21:37,179 --> 00:21:38,707
Because you have his blood.

457
00:21:39,574 --> 00:21:41,794
And I know
that he's not your dad.

458
00:21:42,015 --> 00:21:44,199
I know that he was
never there for you.

459
00:21:44,376 --> 00:21:47,714
And I'm--I would never ask you
to give him anything.

460
00:21:47,802 --> 00:21:50,481
He doesn'teserve a thing
from you. He doesn't.

461
00:21:51,145 --> 00:21:52,278
But he's...

462
00:21:53,793 --> 00:21:55,269
He's gonna die, meredith

463
00:21:56,986 --> 00:21:58,056
(voice breaking)
and so I'm asking you

464
00:21:58,126 --> 00:21:59,722
To give something to me.

465
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,360
I'm asking...

466
00:22:02,337 --> 00:22:05,816
I am asking you
to give me my dad.

467
00:22:07,398 --> 00:22:10,062
Because as crappy
as he was to you,

468
00:22:10,145 --> 00:22:12,927
Oh, he was wonderful to me.

469
00:22:14,352 --> 00:22:17,868
He never missed
a single dance recital.

470
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:20,149
He was there
at my fifth grade graduation,

471
00:22:20,216 --> 00:22:21,563
And what is that?

472
00:22:21,624 --> 00:22:23,016
That's not even real.

473
00:22:23,492 --> 00:22:25,488
I know he's not your dad.

474
00:22:25,762 --> 00:22:27,113
I-I know that.

475
00:22:28,189 --> 00:22:30,004
But somehow...

476
00:22:30,765 --> 00:22:34,452
You have his blood,
and I don't.

477
00:22:35,452 --> 00:22:37,230
So I'm asking you...

478
00:22:38,172 --> 00:22:40,138
(sobs)
give me my dad.

479
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:04,560
Hi, meredith.

480
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,238
We found a match.

481
00:23:09,718 --> 00:23:10,492
What?

482
00:23:10,717 --> 00:23:12,184
We found a match,
a donor liver.

483
00:23:12,332 --> 00:23:14,236
So we're gonna schedule
the surgery for tonight.

484
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:16,810
Uh, that's terrific.

485
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:19,440
I... But I thought I--
I wasn't eligible

486
00:23:19,796 --> 00:23:22,083
For the...
The transplant list.

487
00:23:22,341 --> 00:23:23,940
It's not from the list.
It's me.

488
00:23:27,814 --> 00:23:28,752
I got tested,

489
00:23:28,879 --> 00:23:30,833
And my crossmatch
was negative,

490
00:23:30,975 --> 00:23:32,614
Which means
we're an ideal match.

491
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:35,467
So I'm gonna go get admitted,
and we'll do this.

492
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:36,921
(mutters) mer.

493
00:23:39,646 --> 00:23:41,457
I'm a drunk, meredith.

494
00:23:42,443 --> 00:23:44,176
I did this.

495
00:23:44,593 --> 00:23:46,022
I put myself in this bed.

496
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,816
I broke me.

497
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:50,959
I can't.

498
00:23:51,468 --> 00:23:53,540
I won't let you
put me back together.

499
00:23:54,251 --> 00:23:56,234
I've put you through enough.

500
00:23:58,565 --> 00:24:00,805
It's a generous offer.
I can't.

501
00:24:01,627 --> 00:24:03,164
I can't accept it.

502
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,893
(woman) I'm sorry,

503
00:24:09,035 --> 00:24:10,695
But there's gotta be
something else you can do.

504
00:24:10,898 --> 00:24:14,690
He's 31. We just bought
a condo together.

505
00:24:14,781 --> 00:24:16,573
We just rescued a puppy.

506
00:24:16,618 --> 00:24:19,243
Ange, ange,
it's gonna be okay.
No, it's not.

507
00:24:19,411 --> 00:24:21,349
(crying) there just
sending you home to...

508
00:24:22,512 --> 00:24:24,192
What kind of doctors
are you?

509
00:24:24,549 --> 00:24:27,133
You're supposed
to do something.

510
00:24:27,221 --> 00:24:28,518
They're doing everything
they can.

511
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:30,977
All right,ook, dr. Hunt's
given us extra time,

512
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:32,998
Time that we never
would've had--

513
00:24:33,101 --> 00:24:34,415
Dr. Hunt, can I s--

514
00:24:38,127 --> 00:24:38,421
Excuse me.

515
00:24:42,894 --> 00:24:44,600
We could try
cytoreductive surgery.
It won't work.

516
00:24:44,641 --> 00:24:46,573
We have to be able
to remove the entire tumor.

517
00:24:46,633 --> 00:24:48,352
With these kind of adhesions,
you can't do that.

518
00:24:48,418 --> 00:24:50,091
Okay, then what about
ball-tipped electrosurgery?

519
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:53,123
It could help us
get around the adhesions.
His cancer is incurable.
Now I'm not gonna put

520
00:24:53,267 --> 00:24:55,668
That man through another
excruciatingly painful surgery

521
00:24:55,751 --> 00:24:57,603
When he's got
a survival rate of 13%.
I had 5%.

522
00:24:57,676 --> 00:25:01,034
Stevens--
I had a 5% chance
of survival.

523
00:25:01,103 --> 00:25:03,591
I have incurable cancer,
but I am living with it.

524
00:25:03,678 --> 00:25:05,056
And the only reason I am,
the only reason

525
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:07,107
I'm standing here right now is
because no one ever said to me,

526
00:25:07,199 --> 00:25:08,780
"we've done
everythinge can do."

527
00:25:08,867 --> 00:25:11,490
I'm alive right now
because people fought for me.

528
00:25:11,601 --> 00:25:13,526
Cristina fought for me.

529
00:25:13,996 --> 00:25:15,389
He deserves
the chance to fight.

530
00:25:15,459 --> 00:25:16,991
He doesn't want it, fine.
I will shut up.

531
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:18,973
But he deserves a chance.

532
00:25:26,148 --> 00:25:27,906
You know what? I'm good.
I'm off the hook.

533
00:25:28,247 --> 00:25:29,590
I did what I was
supposed to do.

534
00:25:29,707 --> 00:25:32,953
I offered.
Mother teresa would be proud.
You gotta go back in there.

535
00:25:33,818 --> 00:25:35,517
And do what,
cry and call him "daddy"?

536
00:25:35,705 --> 00:25:37,056
He's the sick one, okay?

537
00:25:37,207 --> 00:25:39,182
He's sick and you're not.
You gotta go back in there.

538
00:25:39,583 --> 00:25:41,542
Just say what you gotta say
and make him take it.
Alex, I tried.

539
00:25:42,865 --> 00:25:43,849
Try again.

540
00:26:23,232 --> 00:26:24,684
His b.P. Is normal.

541
00:26:24,968 --> 00:26:26,855
His blood work is pristine.

542
00:26:26,943 --> 00:26:29,075
He, uh, appears to have
the heart of a 50 year old.

543
00:26:29,342 --> 00:26:32,716
So what does that mean?
Uh, that means
cleared for surgery.

544
00:26:33,068 --> 00:26:35,043
And you're really gonna
go through with this, dad?

545
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:39,454
You bet I am, champ.
Well, it's your money.
We can't stop you.

546
00:26:39,703 --> 00:26:41,181
But irene and I
have talked it over.

547
00:26:41,327 --> 00:26:42,989
We've decided if you do this,

548
00:26:43,049 --> 00:26:45,456
We're taking you
out of the home,

549
00:26:45,531 --> 00:26:49,320
Moving you back in with us.
I don't want
to move in with you.

550
00:26:49,434 --> 00:26:51,082
I'happy where I am.

551
00:26:51,326 --> 00:26:54,540
No, that place is causing you
to make irrational decisions.

552
00:26:54,792 --> 00:26:56,571
You're going after
a younger woman,

553
00:26:56,644 --> 00:26:58,707
Sneaking into her room
at night.

554
00:26:58,779 --> 00:27:00,873
It's not appropriate
for a man your age.

555
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,868
Now there's an extra twin
in janey's room,

556
00:27:03,944 --> 00:27:06,341
And she'll be thrilled to spend
more time with her grandpa.

557
00:27:06,404 --> 00:27:09,884
Come on.
It's just an erection.

558
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,706
Excuse me?

559
00:27:11,762 --> 00:27:13,550
All the guy wants
is a woody.

560
00:27:14,155 --> 00:27:15,705
God forbid
you get to be his age,

561
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:17,404
And your kids
won't let you have one.

562
00:27:18,139 --> 00:27:19,244
He's your father.

563
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:21,115
He's taken care of you
your entire lives,

564
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:22,653
Given you everything.

565
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,806
And now he needs something,

566
00:27:23,912 --> 00:27:25,548
And you want to throw that
in his face?

567
00:27:25,726 --> 00:27:27,529
You know how many people
would jump at the chance

568
00:27:27,548 --> 00:27:28,684
To give back
to their parents,

569
00:27:28,753 --> 00:27:31,916
Who would sacrifice everything
without blinking...

570
00:27:35,703 --> 00:27:38,188
And there's nothing wrong
with dating a younger woman.

571
00:27:38,261 --> 00:27:40,522
It keeps you young. And that's
my professional opinion.

572
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,313
Does the chief always...

573
00:27:54,927 --> 00:27:57,315
Pay such attention
to his patients,

574
00:27:57,667 --> 00:27:58,985
Or just the ones...

575
00:27:59,558 --> 00:28:01,479
Whose wives
he had an affair with?

576
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:06,985
Sorry.

577
00:28:08,802 --> 00:28:10,925
How'd I do this
to myself?

578
00:28:13,223 --> 00:28:14,946
How did I end up here?

579
00:28:26,648 --> 00:28:28,127
You woke up every morning...

580
00:28:30,077 --> 00:28:31,439
And you promised yourself

581
00:28:31,513 --> 00:28:33,538
That last night
would be your last drink.

582
00:28:35,331 --> 00:28:36,479
And you made it...

583
00:28:37,984 --> 00:28:39,591
Until 9:00 a.M.

584
00:28:40,307 --> 00:28:41,330
Or noon...

585
00:28:42,884 --> 00:28:46,014
Some days
till cocktail hour.

586
00:28:47,216 --> 00:28:49,254
And you were so pleased
with yourself

587
00:28:49,416 --> 00:28:51,069
That you rewarded yourself

588
00:28:52,229 --> 00:28:53,475
With a drink.

589
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:56,379
You convinced yourself again

590
00:28:57,425 --> 00:28:59,079
That it would be
the only one.

591
00:29:00,324 --> 00:29:02,343
You have a disease,
thatcher.

592
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,449
When you're in it,

593
00:29:05,046 --> 00:29:06,650
You can't stop.

594
00:29:09,213 --> 00:29:10,598
You can't undo what you did.

595
00:29:11,778 --> 00:29:13,138
But meredith...

596
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:15,536
Is offering you
a second chance, man.

597
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:18,111
You need that liver.

598
00:29:18,855 --> 00:29:20,537
You need it now...

599
00:29:23,379 --> 00:29:24,904
If you want to live.

600
00:29:27,585 --> 00:29:29,507
I took her childhood.

601
00:29:31,683 --> 00:29:33,553
I can't take
any more from her.

602
00:29:36,008 --> 00:29:37,319
You...

603
00:29:40,791 --> 00:29:42,798
You better take care
of my girls.

604
00:29:44,307 --> 00:29:46,217
You owe me at least that.

605
00:29:52,002 --> 00:29:53,834
Hey.
My stomach cancer patient?

606
00:29:54,019 --> 00:29:55,344
We're going for the surgery.

607
00:29:55,596 --> 00:29:57,136
We're gonna do it.
Hunt actually listened to me.

608
00:29:57,396 --> 00:29:59,208
That's great.
Right? I'm gonna go
scrub in.

609
00:29:59,321 --> 00:30:01,205
Oh, hey, are you okay?

610
00:30:01,317 --> 00:30:03,943
I'm sorry about
the whole tick thing.

611
00:30:04,095 --> 00:30:05,762
(chuckles) I'm fine.

612
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:08,827
Ah, it's--it's a small price
to pay for fresh air.

613
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,889
Okay. Mm.

614
00:30:11,265 --> 00:30:12,485
You're welcome.

615
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:36,783
You're the guy who used to
pour my cereal in the morning.

616
00:30:37,029 --> 00:30:39,471
That's it. That's all
I remember about you.

617
00:30:40,069 --> 00:30:41,327
You're not my father.

618
00:30:41,538 --> 00:30:43,694
You're just the guy
who used to poury cereal.

619
00:30:44,185 --> 00:30:47,024
And if you die, it probably
won't change my life that much

620
00:30:47,416 --> 00:30:49,674
But it will change hers.

621
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:52,482
If you die, it will break her.

622
00:30:52,911 --> 00:30:54,593
And I'm not gonna let you
do that.

623
00:30:54,771 --> 00:30:56,650
I don't know what it's like
to have a father,

624
00:30:57,401 --> 00:30:59,650
But I do know what it's like
to have a sister,

625
00:31:00,309 --> 00:31:01,543
And it's good.

626
00:31:03,684 --> 00:31:05,425
And if we can
get through this,

627
00:31:05,721 --> 00:31:06,928
Then the door will be open

628
00:31:07,013 --> 00:31:08,549
For us
to get to know each other.

629
00:31:08,831 --> 00:31:10,486
The door's open.

630
00:31:22,603 --> 00:31:25,986
- So before intercourse
he squeezes the pump in his scrotum.
-Ooh.

631
00:31:26,247 --> 00:31:28,197
And...
(owen and derek) oh.

632
00:31:28,496 --> 00:31:31,890
And his age doesn't make it
high risk?
Oh, well, I mean, there's--

633
00:31:31,984 --> 00:31:33,731
There's always risk involved,
but this is the most

634
00:31:33,801 --> 00:31:37,059
Technologically advanced
solution to his problem.
What's high risk?

635
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:41,623
Does someone have a risky,
high-tech surgery?
Uh, cristina, I don't think
you want to, uh--

636
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:46,104
I think this would be
a real challenge for dr. Yang.
Do you think she can handle it?

637
00:31:46,419 --> 00:31:48,277
Oh, I can handle it.
I don't think
she can handle it.

638
00:31:48,317 --> 00:31:49,619
I can handle it.

639
00:31:52,431 --> 00:31:54,143
Pre-op's in 20-83.

640
00:31:54,888 --> 00:31:57,025
Thank you, dr. Sloan.

641
00:31:58,233 --> 00:32:00,379
I'm gonna pay for that later,
but it was kinda worth it.

642
00:32:03,293 --> 00:32:05,497
Beat it.
Sloan wants me on this.

643
00:32:06,943 --> 00:32:08,806
Okay, mr. Waller.

644
00:32:09,318 --> 00:32:10,104
I'm dr. Yang.

645
00:32:10,245 --> 00:32:12,886
I'll be taking over your
pre-operative care this evening

646
00:32:12,991 --> 00:32:15,461
For your
penile implant surgery.

647
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,049
You're getting
a penile implant?

648
00:32:21,191 --> 00:32:23,986
Yes, ma'am.          Oh.

649
00:32:24,049 --> 00:32:25,649
That fella, he was just
gonna shave me.

650
00:32:34,722 --> 00:32:35,711
Terrific.

651
00:32:35,905 --> 00:32:37,280
But you wanted
a surgery.

652
00:32:37,332 --> 00:32:39,832
Yeah, putting a bicycle pump
in some old man's junk...

653
00:32:39,944 --> 00:32:41,166
(laughs)
is not surgery.

654
00:32:41,253 --> 00:32:42,833
It's--it's--
it's punishment.

655
00:32:42,968 --> 00:32:45,321
Well, at least you don't
have to be laid up in bed

656
00:32:45,404 --> 00:32:46,537
For the next month.

657
00:32:46,647 --> 00:32:47,849
You better tell me
all the gossip

658
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:49,339
About the mercy west people.

659
00:32:49,446 --> 00:32:51,287
I want all the gory details.
Yeah, yeah.

660
00:32:53,726 --> 00:32:55,703
Am I stupid
for doing this?

661
00:32:55,886 --> 00:32:56,880
No.

662
00:32:57,641 --> 00:32:58,800
Really?

663
00:32:58,862 --> 00:33:00,456
You get to save
your dad's life tonight.

664
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:05,603
Hey.
Hey.
What are you doing here?

665
00:33:05,828 --> 00:33:07,328
You didn't think I was gonna
let you do this by yourself,

666
00:33:07,393 --> 00:33:09,790
Did you?
Unh-unh. This is not how
this is going to work.

667
00:33:09,958 --> 00:33:11,508
Do I need to find you
something to do?

668
00:33:11,709 --> 00:33:13,986
No. I have a penis.
(chuckles)

669
00:33:17,678 --> 00:33:19,236
I'm gonna sit by her head.
I won't say a word.

670
00:33:19,366 --> 00:33:22,239
Shepherd, this is my o.R.
I respect that, dr. Bailey.

671
00:33:22,311 --> 00:33:24,435
But this is my wife
that you're cutting into.

672
00:33:31,804 --> 00:33:33,420
I... I haven't
just been waiting

673
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:34,841
For the right moment
to propose.

674
00:33:36,289 --> 00:33:37,858
You've been waiting
for remission.

675
00:33:37,962 --> 00:33:39,429
Yeah. I just didn't want
to saddle her down

676
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:40,880
With a sick husband.

677
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:43,667
But now it looks like
that just mighbe

678
00:33:43,745 --> 00:33:44,908
Part of the package.

679
00:33:44,983 --> 00:33:46,922
So... What the hell?

680
00:33:47,027 --> 00:33:50,557
I'm not gonna waste
another moment.
You shouldn't.

681
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:54,154
(man) ready when you are.
You ready?

682
00:34:14,301 --> 00:34:17,313
I had five interns. Four of you
have been on this table.

683
00:34:17,647 --> 00:34:19,407
One of you has cancer,
one of you died.

684
00:34:19,868 --> 00:34:22,609
You better not pull
anything funny on me, grey.

685
00:34:48,133 --> 00:34:50,081
All right, let's see
what we got here.

686
00:34:50,249 --> 00:34:52,372
Dr. Yang,
the, uh, senior resident,

687
00:34:53,777 --> 00:34:54,850
Should test the apparatus.

688
00:34:54,963 --> 00:34:56,270
I'll understand
if you wanna pass.

689
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:01,724
No, I don't pass,
dr. Sloan.

690
00:35:01,989 --> 00:35:03,215
This might be a joke
to all of you,

691
00:35:03,305 --> 00:35:04,410
But I do my job.

692
00:35:06,384 --> 00:35:07,797
Squeezing the scrotum.
(air whooshes in pump)

693
00:35:10,019 --> 00:35:10,650
Nice.

694
00:35:10,871 --> 00:35:11,963
Awesome.

695
00:35:26,221 --> 00:35:27,493
(alex) liver's here.

696
00:35:35,108 --> 00:35:37,792
(owen) make sure
you keep the bowel covered.
I need more wet laps.

697
00:35:40,356 --> 00:35:41,965
Ah.
Oh, he's got
some collateral bleeding.

698
00:35:42,071 --> 00:35:44,663
I'm gonna need the argon beamer.
Hang more f.F.P.

699
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:46,083
B.P.'s dropping out.
(monitor beeping erratically)

700
00:35:47,977 --> 00:35:51,586
Sir, you really can't
kill this guy.
I'm aware of that, karev.

701
00:36:03,764 --> 00:36:05,467
If it's bad news,
i don't want to wake her.

702
00:36:06,709 --> 00:36:07,839
Wake her.

703
00:36:37,173 --> 00:36:38,041
He had a couple months,

704
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:39,231
And we just
took that away.

705
00:36:41,217 --> 00:36:42,842
I'm sorry. it's my fault.

706
00:36:42,899 --> 00:36:43,765
No, it's my fault.

707
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:46,715
It was my call,
and it was the wrong call.

708
00:36:46,789 --> 00:36:48,543
I was wrong, and i should've
known better. i should've...

709
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:53,319
(inhales and exhales deeply)
i should've taught better.

710
00:36:53,568 --> 00:36:55,028
But, you know, you see
a one in a million,

711
00:36:55,118 --> 00:36:59,300
And you want to believe.
i was wrong to do the surgery.

712
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:01,009
I was wrong to put you
on this case.

713
00:37:01,055 --> 00:37:02,514
You weren't ready.
you weren't ready to be here.

714
00:37:02,586 --> 00:37:04,794
You beat the odds, stevens.
you were that one in a million.

715
00:37:04,872 --> 00:37:07,867
But you cannot be a doctor
and a patient in here.

716
00:37:07,993 --> 00:37:09,682
You have to choose.

717
00:37:35,981 --> 00:37:37,374
How'd it go, doc?

718
00:37:39,041 --> 00:37:40,536
I don't think
you'll be disappointed.

719
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:44,787
Well, well, well.

720
00:37:44,874 --> 00:37:45,927
Dr. sloan,

721
00:37:46,007 --> 00:37:48,528
I'd... i'd like you
to meet my marion.

722
00:37:49,209 --> 00:37:51,161
Hello, sweetheart.

723
00:38:03,194 --> 00:38:05,440
Sir.
now is not the time,
yang.

724
00:38:05,502 --> 00:38:08,052
I have good hands.
they're fast. they're dexterous.

725
00:38:08,125 --> 00:38:10,829
They were made to throw ties
and do complex procedures.

726
00:38:10,901 --> 00:38:13,001
These hands
were made for surgery.

727
00:38:13,138 --> 00:38:14,876
Today, they should've been
deep inside a heart

728
00:38:14,951 --> 00:38:15,876
Saving a life.

729
00:38:15,969 --> 00:38:19,543
Instead they removed a tick
and pumped a penis.
what's your point?

730
00:38:20,565 --> 00:38:20,723
My point?

731
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,642
You know what?
you should cut me.

732
00:38:28,607 --> 00:38:30,017
What?
from the program.

733
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:32,517
You have to make more cuts,
and i should go.

734
00:38:32,633 --> 00:38:34,062
'cause if you can't give me

735
00:38:34,108 --> 00:38:35,842
A brilliant
cardiothoracic attending

736
00:38:35,899 --> 00:38:37,079
Who is willing to teach me,

737
00:38:37,178 --> 00:38:39,779
Then i can't get what i need
from this hospital.

738
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:43,029
Everyone is scared of losing
their job, and so am i.

739
00:38:43,128 --> 00:38:46,980
But if i can't learn,
if i can't use my gift,

740
00:38:47,037 --> 00:38:48,570
Then i...

741
00:38:49,171 --> 00:38:50,893
I-i guess
that scares me more.

742
00:38:54,122 --> 00:38:55,464
That's my point, sir.

743
00:39:01,966 --> 00:39:03,118
<i>the thing about being
a surgeon...</i>

744
00:39:03,491 --> 00:39:05,875
<i>everybody wants a piece of you.</i>

745
00:39:07,728 --> 00:39:09,259
<i>we take one little oath...</i>

746
00:39:12,158 --> 00:39:13,607
The case where he kept
his mouth guard--

747
00:39:13,693 --> 00:39:15,271
You should open it.

748
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,671
I'm very sorry for your loss.

749
00:39:24,157 --> 00:39:26,563
<i>and suddenly, we're drowning
in obligations...</i>

750
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:30,683
<i>to our patients,
to our colleagues,</i>

751
00:39:31,552 --> 00:39:32,710
<i>to medicine itself.</i>

752
00:39:36,911 --> 00:39:37,963
Chief.

753
00:39:39,685 --> 00:39:41,236
Are--are you okay?

754
00:39:42,666 --> 00:39:44,019
I have responsibilities...

755
00:39:44,752 --> 00:39:46,674
To make this hospital

756
00:39:46,761 --> 00:39:48,866
The best medical facility
it could be...

757
00:39:49,475 --> 00:39:51,810
To repair
what i have broken,

758
00:39:52,879 --> 00:39:55,514
Even if it was 20 years ago.

759
00:39:58,074 --> 00:40:00,157
If i am now the bad guy,

760
00:40:00,317 --> 00:40:01,580
If i am now the villain here,

761
00:40:02,037 --> 00:40:03,139
Well...

762
00:40:05,678 --> 00:40:07,894
Well, so be it.

763
00:40:11,324 --> 00:40:12,862
This must be so hard
for you.

764
00:40:21,215 --> 00:40:22,765
Thanks, torres.

765
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:25,502
I w--i was gonna...

766
00:40:25,991 --> 00:40:27,113
I was... (sighs)

767
00:40:28,569 --> 00:40:29,761
But i'm gonna--
i'm gonna go.

768
00:40:29,836 --> 00:40:32,237
So... you take care, okay?
torres.

769
00:40:33,433 --> 00:40:34,341
Sir?

770
00:40:34,745 --> 00:40:36,914
Go see h.r. tomorrow.

771
00:40:37,706 --> 00:40:39,044
Tell 'em
you're an attending surgeon

772
00:40:39,116 --> 00:40:40,480
At seattle grace hospital,

773
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:42,895
And you want a new badge.

774
00:40:43,892 --> 00:40:46,895
And... take some
of these danish home.

775
00:40:47,259 --> 00:40:49,066
They'll just go to waste.

776
00:40:55,699 --> 00:40:58,700
<i>so we do
what any sane person would do.</i>

777
00:40:59,371 --> 00:41:01,138

778
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:03,305

00:41:03,896 --> 00:41:05,558
(izzie) aah!
(growling)

780
00:41:06,882 --> 00:41:09,802
Oh, god. (gasping)

781
00:41:09,911 --> 00:41:12,142
A deer?
we have to move.

782
00:41:16,553 --> 00:41:17,967
<i>but sooner or later,</i>

783
00:41:18,448 --> 00:41:19,837

Hey. you're awake.

785
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:37,017
H-how--how's your pain?
is your--is your mouth dry?

786
00:41:37,086 --> 00:41:38,525
There's water.
are you thirsty?

787
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:42,566
(groans) have you been
sleeping on me all night?

788
00:41:43,141 --> 00:41:45,246
Yeah. i was... moving
between you and dad,

789
00:41:45,417 --> 00:41:46,840
Who--who's doing good.

790
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:49,123
Good. good. that's good.

791
