1
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,450
It's impossible to describe the panic
that comes over you when you're a surgeon

2
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,510
and your pager goes off
in the middle of the night.

3
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,190
Your heart starts to race.

4
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:28,900
Please don't be mine. Don't be mine.

5
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:31,060
Your mind freezes.

6
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:32,840
Your fingers go numb.

7
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:34,030
Not mine.

8
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:35,450
Wake up.

9
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,540
- I'm up.
- They're paging you.

10
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,120
You're invested.

11
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:43,730
I'm sleeping!

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,000
They're someone's mom, someone's dad,

13
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,310
someone's kid, and now it's on you,

14
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,300
because that someone's
life now in your hands.

15
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,390
Robbins, Karev's with
your patient in trauma two.

16
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,950
Torres, come with me. We
have a 15-year-old female.

17
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,410
She fell off the roof of her
house. Now I think that we should...

18
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,060
She's gonna be okay right?

19
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,180
Please, I just need to
know. Is she gonna be okay?

20
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,120
And this is her mother.

21
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:07,990
Mrs. Boyd, I need to bring Dr.
Torres up to speed right now, okay?

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,810
She's never been in any accident before.

23
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,650
She's never even broken any bones.

24
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,910
Oh, you paged me here at 4:00
a.m. for a couple of broken bones?

25
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,550
More like 50.

26
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,390
As surgeons, we're always
invested in our patients.

27
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,820
Laura Young, 30 weeks
pregnant. Car accident.

28
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,330
Head CT showed a subdural.
Shepherd's coming in.

29
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,020
Baby's in distress. O.B'S on its way.

30
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,300
Oh, it hurts. It really hurts.

31
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,020
Okay, wait. Hold on. Stop.

32
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,690
- Move the wand up.
- What?

33
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,410
Okay, baby's brain is hemorrhaging.

34
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,680
She needs a crash "c" while
shepherd handles the bleed.

35
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,350
Get ready to grab a
railand start running.

36
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,880
But when your patient's a child...

37
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,160
- Get another unit of packed cells, meet me in the O.R.
- Right away.

38
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,510
You're not just invested...

39
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,190
We need the O.R.

40
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,810
You're responsible...

41
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,170
Well, we need it, too.
We're already our way.

42
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,900
There's only one O.R
prepped this time of night.

43
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,380
Which is why we need it.

44
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,600
Mine's got a subduraro.

45
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,720
50 broken bones.

46
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,600
Stroke in the womb!

47
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,600
All right, uh, get
another O.R. ready now.

48
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:05,550
Responsible for whether or not
that child survives, has a future.

49
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,800
And that's enough to terrify anyone.

53
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,630
What's her status?

54
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,730
Mom's heart rate and, uh,
BP has been fluctuating,

55
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:19,860
but she's ready for you.

56
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,310
All right, let's prep
her for a craniotomy.

57
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,690
Apgar's only 4. We need
to get to the nicu now.

58
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,780
All right, drain's in a good position.

59
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,950
Yeah, she's breathing over the vent.
Maybe we should consider extubating her?

60
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,280
Yeah, but watch for apneic episodes,
and keep an eye out for her CBC.

61
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,520
There's still too much
blood draining from her head.

62
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,420
What time is it, Karev?

63
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,290
Uh, half past 8:00.

64
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,100
Half past 8:00.

65
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:42,330
I've already beenwake for 5 hours,
and my day hasn't even started.

66
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,710
Rough way to start your morning.

67
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:47,490
A stroke before you're even
born... rough way to start a life.

68
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,800
Hey, I brought you some coffee.

69
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,050
Oh, you already have one.

70
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,040
Oh, no. I want your
coffee. I need your coffee.

71
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,000
Okay, when you see Cristina,
she is gonna be mad.

72
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,160
She's gonna be mad at me for not
paging her in here last night,

73
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,330
possibly mad at you for
not waking her up either.

74
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,940
Now I am handling
this. Do not engage her.

75
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,540
Do not provoke her. Simply
ignore her, all right?

76
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,960
Oh, that's your plan... ignore
the scalpel-hungry animal?

77
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,810
Yep, until I come up
with something better.

78
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,800
Okay, I know this is the first time on
a Peds rotation with me for some of you.

79
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,170
Not for others.

80
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,130
But I wanted you to understand that

81
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,980
I run my Peds unit a little
differently than you may be used to.

82
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,800
This is not general
surgery in miniature.

83
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,560
These are the tiny
humans. These are children.

84
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,400
They believe in magic.

85
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:43,200
They play pretend. There is
fairy dust in their I.V. bags.

86
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,420
They hope and they cross their
fingers and they make wishes.

87
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,100
And that makes them more
resilient than adults.

88
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:52,660
They recover faster,
survive worse. They believe.

89
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,040
In Peds, we have... miracles and magic.

90
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:00,170
In Peds, anything is possible.

91
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,630
Morning, Dr. Robbins.

92
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,710
Good morning, Dr. Wallace.

93
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,370
I see that you've already introduced
yourself to Mr. And Mrs. Boydyes.

94
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,150
Yes, reminds me of Hillary at that age.

95
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,750
Such an overachier.

96
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,550
Dr. Yang, why don't you present?

97
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,990
Excuse me, little... doctor boy.

98
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,620
Uh, Hillary boyd, 15 years old,
fell off the roof of her house.

99
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:38,180
52 acute fractures were diagnosed
when she was admitted last night.

100
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:43,220
An intricate and extremely challenging
OIF surgery was performed by Dr. Torres

101
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:47,200
and Dr. Hunt this morning before rounds.

102
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,600
Thank you, Dr. Yang.

103
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,860
If she fares well enough today,

104
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:53,710
I'd like to go in tomorrow to repair
her subtrochanteric fracture next.

105
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,870
Can anyone tell me the proper dosage
of ceftriaxone for a pediatric patient?

106
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,350
50 milligrams per kilogram per day.

107
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:04,660
And, Dr. Wallace, can you tell me the proper
dose for this patient if she were 42 kilograms?

108
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,250
2.1 grams per day... if
you carry the decimal.

109
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,480
Okay, who's presenting?

110
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,090
I am, Dr. Robbins.

111
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,170
Proceed.

112
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,410
Wallace Anderson...

113
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,010
10 years old... almost 11...

114
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,870
Been here for 7 months. In and
out over the past two years.

115
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,770
Suffers from short gut syndrome, which
means he can't properly absorb nutrition.

116
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:33,240
Exactly. Dr. Percy?

117
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,800
Uh, 15 intestinal surgeries to date,

118
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,560
plus a bowel lengthening
procedure, which helped for a while,

119
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:41,750
but recently, he's had to go
back to being fed through TPN.

120
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,000
How'd he do this morning?

121
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,400
We covered some pretty
advanced algebraic conversions.

122
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:50,510
Dr. Robbins helps me with my math and
science homework by letting me go on rounds.

123
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:53,050
- Fascinating.
- We try to keep his life as normal we can,

124
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,030
even living in a hospital.

125
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:58,550
But I can skip my homework on
Friday, right, since it's my birthday?

126
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,350
Since it's your birthday.

127
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,550
What about Dr. Robbins?
It is her birthday, too.

128
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,980
I'm afraid I can't skip
my homework, Wallace,

129
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,860
but I can come celebrate
with you like I promised.

130
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,150
Dr. Robbins.

131
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,480
We've requested a meeting later with Chief Wwebber
and a representative from the hospital board.

132
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,510
And we'd like you there, too.

133
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,170
Alright.

134
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,060
So they didn't give you any indication
as to what this meeting was about?

135
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,120
You know as much as I do.

136
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,550
You treated their son, right?

137
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,760
Well, you better pray that you
didn't do something to piss them off.

138
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:37,250
God knows that this hospital can't
afford another misstep right now.

139
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,040
It's a pleasure to see you again, paul.

140
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,660
Bethany, you look lovely.

141
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,500
We didn't think Wallace
would see his 9th birthday,

142
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,080
let alone his 10th.

143
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,400
And now this week, his 11th.

144
00:06:55,420 --> 00:07:00,500
Which is why we'd like to offer Seattle
Grace Mercy West's Peds program a gift

145
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,300
of $25 million.

146
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,440
$25 million?

147
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:12,250
Half to go to research to continue
searching for a cure for Wallace's condition,

148
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,510
and half to the hospital itself.

149
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,760
I... um... I mean...

150
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,810
$25 million?

151
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,790
Happy birthday, Arizona.

152
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,880
I always knew that Wallace's
parents were wealthy,

153
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,690
but not $25-million wealthy.

154
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,210
I mean, that's "libraries
named after you" kind of money,

155
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,730
"saved babies in Africa and has dinner
at the White House regularly" type money.

156
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,610
People don't give me that kind of money.

157
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,600
You have an unfair advantage.
You work with children.

158
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,630
Oatmeal, side of fruit,
wheat toast, hold the butter.

159
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,550
Thank you.

160
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,610
You know what? That money is gonna make
such a difference for so many patients.

161
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,230
It's... it's really amazing.

162
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,840
Maybe I should start doing
more cleft-palate kids.

163
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,370
Everyone's a sucker for those.

164
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,690
Cheese omelet, extra butter,
cinnamon toast, crispy bacon.

165
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,350
Mine!

166
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:02,750
$25 million is pretty cool, right?

167
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,510
Best birthday gift ever.

168
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,800
Birthday gift?

169
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,850
Well, 'c... cause the money's a gift.

170
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,020
I mean, technically it's for
the hospital, not Arizona,

171
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,400
but since your birthday's on Friday...

172
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,580
How does Little Grey know
about your birthday and I don't?

173
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,880
Birthdays are just days
like any other days.

174
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:20,110
I don't like them. Don't
celebrate them. No big deal.

175
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:23,040
$25 million? That's a big deal.

176
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,860
Crap. I'm gonna be late.
I will see you there.

177
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,900
Okay, she's downplaying it, right?

178
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:34,550
I'm her girlfriend. I have to do
something for her birthday, right?

179
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,240
- Yes.
- No.

180
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,460
Of course you do.

181
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:38,850
A... a surprise party.

182
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,210
Bad idea.

183
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:44,580
Surprise parties are
hostile. They're dark.

184
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:47,040
People jump out and scream at you.

185
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,950
They never come to any good.

186
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,910
Karev.

187
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,450
Good morning, chief.

188
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,480
Uh, when you're free, come find me.

189
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,610
What's that all about?

190
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,610
He fired me.

191
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:05,680
And I refused to be fired.

192
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:08,270
So I say hello to him every
morning, and he says not a word.

193
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,040
Sounds familiar.

194
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:09,970
You haven't heard from stevens?

195
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,250
Not a word.

196
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,730
They'll come around
when they come around.

197
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,410
Chief, you need me?

198
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:24,270
Uh, I wish I didn't have to
saddle you with this, Karev, but...

199
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,640
What is all this?

200
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,620
As Stevens left no forwarding address,

201
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:30,410
and as you are officially
her next of kin,

202
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:34,100
this is her unpaid balance
of her medical bills.

203
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:35,820
Unpaid balance? I... I don't get it.

204
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,050
We work here at the hospital.

205
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,140
Ah, and insurance doesn't
take care of everything.

206
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,100
I'm sorry, but accounting's been
pressuring me since the merger,

207
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,420
and I can't ignore it any longer.

208
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,390
What's yours in for?

209
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,770
Mm, delivered her yesterday.

210
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,500
Stroked out at 10 weeks premature.

211
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,750
Yours?

212
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,480
Born with its insides on the outside.

213
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,410
Two days post-op. Resilient little guy.

214
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,150
More bleeding overnight.

215
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,010
Should we try FFP?

216
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,690
At this point, we should try anything.

217
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,500
Get me a repeat MRI.

218
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:20,030
And page me if she becomes bradycardic
or starts having apnea spells.

219
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,430
I'll be on rounds.

220
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:31,190
Um, I was picking up some labs from Dr.
Bailey, and I saw that you had these waiting.

221
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,740
Thought I'd bring 'em
by, save you the trip.

222
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,660
Thanks.

223
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:38,840
Are you okay?

224
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:42,530
I overheard a little bit of
your conversation with the chief.

225
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:45,320
I'm trying to save a baby
here. Get outta my face.

226
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:50,120
Got it.

227
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,440
Is he still sleeping?

228
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,070
No.

229
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,420
He had a bad night.

230
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:04,940
I can still go on rounds. I feel better.

231
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:05,870
Just give me a second.

232
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,260
You know what? How about if
you just take a rest for now.

233
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:11,630
And then you can join me
for evening rounds instead?

234
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,820
He listens o youmore than he does to me.

235
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,700
Well, yeah. She's a doctor, mom.

236
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,170
And you're just... well, a mom.

237
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:29,180
Well, how about you close your eyes
and you let me do what moms do, okay?

238
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,890
Bad dreams, bad dreams, go away.

239
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:38,320
Good dreams, good dreams, here to stay.

240
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,640
Bad dreams, bad dreams, go away.

241
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:43,650
Good dreams, good dreams, here to stay.

242
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:47,730
You have to do it three
times for it to work.

243
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,200
One more.

244
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,540
I want you to repeat his chemistries
and get an abdominal series.

245
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:56,540
He's had bad nights before, but I want to
make sure that we're not missing anything.

246
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:08,550
How's she doing?

247
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,450
Touch and go.

248
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,800
- How's the baby?
- Same.

249
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,800
Any news from the family?

250
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,180
No, I left a message.
Haven't heard back yet.

251
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,050
ICP is elevated.

252
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,220
BP won't stabilize.

253
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,020
Uh, 100 mics of fentanyl, please.

254
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,050
Laura?

255
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,790
Laura, can you hear me?

256
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:24,320
My baby. Where's my baby?

257
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,000
She's struggling, but she's hanging on.

258
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:26,880
Can I see her?

259
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:29,190
I'm sorry. No. You're
too unstable to move.

260
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,180
So is the baby.

261
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,240
I just want to hold her.

262
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:34,580
Please. I want to hold my baby.

263
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,390
Laura, I need you to stay
calm, okay? Laura, just...

264
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,460
What if she dies before
I get to hold her?

265
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,720
She can't. She can't go before
she's ever even been held.

266
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,580
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

267
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,380
Push 10 of diazepam and give me
some supplemental 0-2, please.

268
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,800
Crap. 911. It's her baby.

269
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,340
She's bradying downd she lost access.

270
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,480
I'll start C-pap.

271
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,250
Dr. Robbins.

272
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:57,980
Not right now.

273
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:01,140
I think you're gonna want to see this.
It's the x-rays on Wallace Anderson.

274
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,450
All right, show me.

275
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,550
See? He has dilated loops of bowel.

276
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:06,650
All right, flip.

277
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:09,180
Flip.

278
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,450
Damn it. Damn it.

279
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,140
He has another bowel obstruction,
and he's not compensating. Okay...

280
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,470
I've got this. Go.

281
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,660
A nurse just checked that.

282
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,800
Yeah, a nurse checked
it, I'm gonna check it,

283
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,480
and three other people in the O.R.
are gonna check it. We're thorough.

284
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,000
Honey, please let them do their jobs.

285
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,230
Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Boyd.

286
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,770
We thought that you should know that
Hillary's tox screens from yesterday

287
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,550
show signs psilocybin
in her bloodstream.

288
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,110
What does that mean?

289
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,990
Well, it means that when she
fell from the roof, she was, uh...

290
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,890
Shrooming.

291
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:45,870
Magic mushrooms.

292
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,100
What?

293
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,150
Hillary?

294
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:48,880
Mushrooms?

295
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:50,780
Oh, come on. Can
everybody please chill out?

296
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,690
What in God' names were you thinking?

297
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,300
You know, I can't believe...

298
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,230
You're a disappointment, young
lady, a big, big, disappointment.

299
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:01,950
Dad, please. Okay, the last
thing I am is a disappointment.

300
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,680
I get straight A's. I'm on honor roll.

301
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:04,560
I run the student council.

302
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:08,200
I basically am the school paper, and
I tutor kids with reading problems.

303
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,480
I'm every parent's dream
come true, including yours.

304
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:14,940
I was exploring the bounds of my
consciousness with the help of a mushroom.

305
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,160
I made a calculated risk going
on that roof. Falling off?

306
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:20,670
Well, that was a low-probability event,

307
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,420
and even low-probability
events occasionally occur,

308
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,620
and this one did.

309
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:30,130
So, yeah, you're bummed I miscalculated
'cause it reminds you of your own fallibility.

310
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,140
I'm bummed, too.

311
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,200
Let's just leave it at that.

312
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:43,180
Cap refill is five
seconds. Push one of epi.

313
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,320
It's not working. Heart
rate's down to the 60s.

314
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,010
Starting compressions.

315
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,000
Could I help?

316
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:52,950
Doubt it.

317
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,110
At this rate, this kid's not
gonna last more than an hour.

318
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:57,600
She's only 30 weeks.
Pretty young to survive.

319
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,380
So what, you're just gonna
stand there and watch her die?

320
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:03,110
Mm, pretty much.

321
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,030
That sucks.

322
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,880
It is what it is. It's protocol.

323
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,800
Eping drives me nuts.

324
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,990
- Look, I mean...
- The kid's gonna die.

325
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,180
Deal with it or get out.

326
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,490
Hey there, girl.

327
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,380
I got you.

328
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,510
It's okay.

329
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:44,040
You're not alone. No,
you're not. You're not alone.

330
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,240
Wait. Hold on.

331
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:50,080
Are you saying you can't do more
surgery on him, or you won't?

332
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,880
It's not a question of if I can.
It's whether or not I should.

333
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:58,720
In my opinion, Wallace isn't strong
enough to handle another operation.

334
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,980
But with surgery, how
long would he have then?

335
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,730
I... I'm not confident that
he'll even make it ofthe table.

336
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,590
But if he did, how long?

337
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,180
I strongly advise against...

338
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,490
How long?

339
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,760
Maybe two months. I...

340
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:26,200
I'm s... I'm sorry.

341
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,820
But the moment that we've
been fighting for two years...

342
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,660
It's here.

343
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:40,340
So you need to prepare yourselves

344
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,420
and you need to prepare Wallace.

345
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,080
You think I've been pouring all
this money into research so that

346
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:47,170
you could find a cure
for some other kid?

347
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,480
- Mr. Anderson...
- No. You have to do this surgery.

348
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,380
Mr. Anderson, I'm...

349
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,760
You buy our son two more months.

350
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,910
You buy him more time so
that we can buy him a cure.

351
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:03,510
I'm sorry.

352
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:15,000
Robbins.

353
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:21,100
These aren't people who hear the word no

354
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:25,000
if they want surgery for their son,
they'll get surgery for their son,

355
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:27,380
whether or not you're the one to do it.

356
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,140
You've been with this boy since day one.

357
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,950
I believe you can do this successfully.

358
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,660
Don't walk away now unless you know
beyond a shadow of a doubt that you can't.

359
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,910
The surgery is a bad idea, chief.

360
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,520
But is it impossible? In your hands...

361
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,470
Is it impossible?

362
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,800
Okay, I'll do it.

363
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:00,210
I'll try.

364
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,050
Is that the preemie?

365
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,950
Oh, yeah. I was just, uh...

366
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:21,220
Well, I tried everything.

367
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:24,980
I just thought maybe somebody should
hold her before, you know, she...

368
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:27,050
Kangaroo.

369
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:28,290
What?

370
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,420
The way you're holding the baby,
it's called a kangaroo hold.

371
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:35,280
Uh, there's been cases where the
kangaroo has helped babies thrive.

372
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:38,300
But look, Karev, look at
the numbers. Look at this.

373
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,880
Heart rate's going up.

374
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:42,500
Yeah, it is, and her
temperature is normal.

375
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,320
Karev, you may have just kick-started
this baby's entire system.

376
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,990
Just by holding her?

377
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:51,380
Take off your shirt.

378
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,000
What? No. Take off your shirt.

379
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,650
No, no. Just...

380
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,850
The kangaroo hold, it's most effective
when there's skin-on-skin contact.

381
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:00,700
It's usually the mom, but, you
know, you're gonna have to do.

382
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:04,110
I'm not kidding. Take off your shirt.

383
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,460
Well, it looks like you used pretty much
every piece of hardware in the hospital.

384
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,230
Yeah, it makes you think twice
about shrooming on a roof.

385
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:18,100
And the mouth on this one? If I
talked to my parents like that...

386
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:20,510
Oh, my father would've...

387
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:23,020
Oh, you don't even want tknow.

388
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,930
I had perfect grades, perfect record,

389
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,760
and I said whatever I
wanted, did whatever I wanted.

390
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,610
My parents couldn't do a thing about it.

391
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,590
Want to hear about my childhood?

392
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:40,510
No? Okay. I'll just, uh, think
about it quietly in my own head.

393
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,790
All right, nailst in, everything's
tight. Let's take a look.

394
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,660
Fantastic.

395
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,760
End-tidal Co2 just
dropped from 34 to 22.

396
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:54,340
Oh, come on. Give me
a break here, Hillary.

397
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,820
She has a new murmur.

398
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:02,260
There's an air embolus in her heart.

399
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,390
All right, flood the field with saline.

400
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,630
Give me the bone wax. Page
cardio and set up a chest tray.

401
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:09,200
And put her in trendelenburg.
I can... I can aspirate it.

402
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:12,460
No, no, we wait for cardio
and we try to find the source.

403
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:13,560
No, it'll take me 30 seconds.

404
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:14,920
It might take cardio
half an hour to get here.

405
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:15,940
- Dr. Yang...
- I've done this before.

406
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:17,640
I know what I'm doing. She
could arrest at any moment.

407
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,470
Dr. Yang, no. End of discussion.

408
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,900
See?I t's the
skin-to-skin contact.

409
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:29,970
The baby can feel your warmth better,

410
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:33,270
sense your heartbeat better. See that?

411
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,250
The baby's own heart is
picking up in response.

412
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,070
Karev, what are you doing?

413
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,200
He's saving a baby's life, that's what.

414
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,830
Dr. Bailey, I...

415
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:44,980
Oh, no shirt. He's wearing no shirt.

416
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,210
Have you started to lactate yet?

417
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,500
Bailey made me.

418
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,230
Is this the room for the calendar
shoot? I was told it was downstairs.

419
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,640
Yeah, all right. That's enough.

420
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:56,070
Everybody out. Let Karev do
what he's doing in private.

421
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:58,370
What is he doing exactly?

422
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,910
Out. Out.

423
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,880
This is ridiculous. You're
wasting all this time down here,

424
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,720
when we should be dealing with
the heart problem directly.

425
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:13,900
We are following protocol.

426
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:17,500
Cardio is on its way, and we can find
the source of the embolus this way.

427
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,410
Screw it.

428
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,410
Dr. Yang, the patient is not coding,
and you are not qualified to do this.

429
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:39,390
Opening the left chest.

430
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:40,490
Oh, Yang, really?

431
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,650
- Turn on e fluoro.
- Dr. Yang.

432
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,330
Will someone please step on the fluoro?

433
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,770
Or do you want me to go in blind?

434
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,040
Dr. Yang, put down that scalpel!

435
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:57,980
Thank you.

436
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:00,920
Cristina!

437
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,980
Scissors.

438
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,310
Cristina

439
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,480
Cristina! Cardio's here, Yang.

440
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,320
It's done. I'm done.

441
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,830
Air embolus out.

442
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,620
The patient was crashing.

443
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,130
She was not crashing.

444
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:47,000
It was a procedure I've done before.

445
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:50,070
- I handled it, and she's fine
- Yeah, but what if she wasn't?

446
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:54,160
You could've lacerateder heart or cut the
phrenic nerve. She could've died on that table.

447
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:56,010
What then? It would've
been your license.

448
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:58,810
All so you could prove what exactly?

449
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,900
Well, I did it to stabilize the patient.

450
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,240
You were just watchingher vitals drop.

451
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:10,330
Waiting for a C.T. surgeon who would've been
able to take a more minimally invasive approach.

452
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:13,660
I could've done a thoracotomy myself
if I had thought it was indicated.

453
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,090
I've been around the
block once or twice.

454
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:17,120
You know, I kinda...
I kinda know what i'ing.

455
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,540
I'm aware of that. I was just...

456
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:23,090
You just thought ever...

457
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:28,470
You just thought... you just thought
everything would be better if you took charge.

458
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,560
And you know I have to report
this to the chief, right?

459
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,630
At a time when he is scouring
this place for people to fire.

460
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,120
Well, he's not gonna fire me.

461
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:40,880
Oh, r... of course not, 'cause
you're... you're invincible.

462
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:46,960
No, he's not gonna fire me because the last time that I did
an open thoracotomy for an embolus was with him in his O.R.

463
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:50,810
Only he was giving me words of
encouragement, not screaming in my ear.

464
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:58,780
For the record? You
rocked that in there.

465
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:00,980
Hunt's just jealous he
didn't do it himself.

466
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:02,900
Shut up.

467
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:10,230
Okay, you won't believe what
just happened in surgery with...

468
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,430
You okay?

469
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:15,450
Tell me I'm great.

470
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,350
- What?
- I need for you to tell me that I'm great.

471
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,310
You're great.

472
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,240
I mean really tell me, because I'm
about to go in on a surgery right now

473
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:27,110
that I'm not sure I should be going in
on, and I can't think like that, right?

474
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:31,410
I can't go into the O.R.
feeling like this. So...

475
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:36,760
I need you to tell me I'm great,
and make me... make me hear it.

476
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,590
You are great.

477
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:49,820
You... are... great.

478
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,770
Thank you.

479
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:00,420
Hey there. You ready to go?

480
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,970
I was gonna take you to the O.R. myself.

481
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:04,030
I've been here a while now, Dr. Robbins.

482
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:09,310
And... I've seen kids
go home and go away.

483
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:13,500
Like Evan... the kid from down
the hall with asthma last month.

484
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,960
He died the day before he
was supposed to be discharged.

485
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:20,090
- You're not Evan.
- And Chloe... the heart girl?

486
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:22,680
She was here for three
weeks before she died.

487
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:23,800
No one says you're gonna die.

488
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,800
I've been here for seven months.

489
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,540
I've been here the longest of
anyone on the floor, by double.

490
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:35,230
- Wallace...
- They say it's like going to sleep.

491
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:37,320
And maybe it is.

492
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:42,660
But what if I go to sleep,
and I have nightmares?

493
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:52,780
More traction, please. Damn it.

494
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:55,220
The mesentery's really friable.

495
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,340
Percy, a little help on the suction.

496
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,820
This is not a good idea.

497
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:03,370
This surgery... not a good idea.

498
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:05,450
Could we get a washcloth
for Dr. Robbins, please?

499
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:07,900
- No, it's fine.
- Just take a moment.

500
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:17,280
Thank you.

501
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,100
Pick ups, please.

502
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:25,140
I left you messages.

503
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:27,790
I'm sorry. I was in surgery.
There were complications.

504
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:30,950
I don't care, okay ?I operated on
Wallace tonight even when I knew better.

505
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,660
And I keep retracing every step, every
suture, and I keep going over it and over it...

506
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,850
- He didn't make it?
- He did.

507
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:39,350
He's in recovery. That's not the point.

508
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,080
What I needed from you tonight
was a little support for once.

509
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:45,870
- And you weren't here.
- Okay, you're scared, and so you're picking a fight.

510
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:48,190
- You get that, yeah?
- Yeah. Yeah. Fine. Whatever.

511
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,270
But I have helped you
through crisis after crisis.

512
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:53,010
And once I thought that I could come
here tonight, and I could get something...

513
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:55,200
- Let it go already. It's done.
- I have every right to be mad, Cristina.

514
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:57,370
You would've never pulled a stunt
like that with another attending.

515
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,280
I seem to recall Callie was there.

516
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:01,370
- Still didt stop me.
- Okay, guys, not now.

517
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:04,720
You took advantage of me and you
took advantage of our relationship.

518
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,680
Oh, please. The kid was dying.

519
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,390
Wait. What kid? What happened?

520
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,100
- Oh, so you didn't hear?
- No. , I didn't.

521
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:13,770
Cristina... she performed an unauthorized
and unnecessary thoracotomy against my orders.

522
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:14,810
She what?

523
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,010
I saved the patient's life.

524
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,670
Wait. Okay, so you were
there, and you didn't tell me?

525
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:19,380
I was going to, but you were
all, "tell me I'm great."

526
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:22,260
So... Oh, so it's my fault
that Yang went rogue on a child?

527
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,880
No... no, you know what? It
wasn't rogue. It was brilliant.

528
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,740
No, it wasn't.

529
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:28,780
You know, I... I'm done.

530
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,680
You got lucky today, Cristina.

531
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:33,320
And you may think that you can
get away with whatever you want,

532
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:36,150
but I am telling you, one of these
days, that luck's gonna run out.

533
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:44,380
Look... Wh... oh, okay.
So you're leaving, too?

534
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,060
Yes, because I have a patient.

535
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,820
Bitches.

536
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:54,060
All right, start an epI drip now.

537
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,270
More irrigation.

538
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,910
Just keep it coming.
Give me a babcock clamp.

539
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,060
Clamp.

540
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,020
Damn it.

541
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,790
Can somebody get me more light?

542
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,250
Pressure's dropping to 68 over 40.

543
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:05,550
Pulse is racing.

544
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,530
Come on, Wallace.

545
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:09,430
What the hell happened
to the Anderson boy?

546
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:10,470
He's in septic shock.

547
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,310
His body was too unstable to handle the
surgery, which is what I said in the first place.

548
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:16,440
- Well, maybe I can help.
- No!No, you can't.

549
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,600
Because as long as you're standing
there breathing over my shoulder,

550
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,830
I feel like I'm operating on a stack of
dollar bills... $25-million-dollar bills...

551
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,750
and what I need to be invested
in right now is this kid.

552
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:26,780
So please get the hell out of my O.R.!

553
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,870
More suction now.

554
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,870
How'd it go?

555
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:46,880
Damn it.

556
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,620
I'll let them know you
did everything you could.

557
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:56,140
Wait, Dr. Robbins, w... don't we have to tell
the parents, let them know that he didn't make it?

558
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,350
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

559
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:00,470
I mean no.

560
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,760
I will not be speaking
to Wallace's parents.

561
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,920
Mr. Jennings and the chief will
take care of that formality,

562
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:09,320
because as far as they're concerned and as far as the
Andersons will be concerned, I just killed their son.

563
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:12,560
I'm a liability, because if they
were to ask me, the truth is,

564
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:17,490
I would tell them that I did just kill their
son, and they should sue, and I am responsible.

565
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:20,470
But that's not in the best
interests of the hospital.

566
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,270
Am I close?

567
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,660
Yeah, I think we're on the same page.

568
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:32,100
My luck will run out.

569
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:34,900
It has nothing to do with luck.

570
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,160
He's being an ass.

571
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,100
You know what? I rocked that embolus.

572
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,670
- What?
- He cares about you.

573
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:47,040
- So?
- So?

574
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,160
So maybe he's a little bit right.

575
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,670
I get it.

576
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:56,310
I mean, I'm dying to get out of this bed and cut,
but you did an unauthorized procedure in an O.R.

577
00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:00,110
I mean, you're an amazing surgeon, but if anything
had gone wrong, that would've been your career.

578
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:02,400
I mean, he cares about your career.

579
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,360
He's in love with you.

580
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:06,770
I hate...

581
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:09,060
married, happy you.

582
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,370
Go to work, and don't cut
anybody open without permission.

583
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,940
You shoulda seen Yang in that surgery.

584
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,330
I mean, she was fearless.

585
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:20,250
And you are hopeless. She's
completely out of your league.

586
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,440
Oh, I'm hopeless, huh?

587
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:26,040
I'm just... stupid.

588
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:32,550
He's married, and have I mentioned, a total
ass to pretty much everyone at all times?

589
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,950
Karev?

590
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:37,590
Did you stay here all night?

591
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,980
Uh, yeah. I... I guess I did.

592
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:42,990
Go home, get some rest. The
nurse will take over for you.

593
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:47,900
No. Uh, I... I'm okay.
I'm... I'm good here.

594
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:53,090
Well, you'd be good
in Peds, you know that?

595
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:57,250
You get invested. You
have good instincts.

596
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:59,780
You stick to your instincts.

597
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,910
You'd be good in Peds, Karev.

598
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:14,890
Yeah, I know. They, uh, say
I can have visitors tomorrow.

599
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:18,640
Cool. And, um, do you have anloopies?

600
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:19,940
Or whatever you have.

601
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:23,310
They only have me on 2
milligrams of morphine at a time.

602
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,680
I know. How lame is that? It's just...

603
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:28,810
Hey, little pusher girl.

604
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:31,670
I'm Hillary's doctor. And
now I have Hillary's phone.

605
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:34,540
So I'm gonna give this
number to the police.

606
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,240
- How lame is that?
- What the hell?

607
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:42,190
Okay. Uh, I know you think you can do
anything and say anything and handle anything.

608
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,710
And that's, you know, almost
true, except for the fact

609
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:51,150
that you fell off a roof 'cause you were so
high that you, what, you thought you could fly?

610
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,810
In surgery, you almost
died of a heart complication

611
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,620
because your body is so strung out from all the crap you've
been putting in it that it almost shut down completely.

612
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:02,760
Okay, that doesn't make you
smarter than everyone else.

613
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,960
It makes you an idiot.

614
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:06,830
The only reason why you're alive is...

615
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,840
you know, is 'cause you're lucky.

616
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,960
So just, you know, grow up.

617
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:40,720
Surprise! Happy...

618
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:58,220
I... I... um... I... I...

619
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:12,340
Told ya.

620
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:20,400
Hey, in retrospect, I realize now, that surprises
parties are hostile and this was a bad idea.

621
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:23,380
Please stop crying. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry about the party.

622
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:25,910
Wallace died.

623
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:31,350
And he's supposed to be turning 11 today,
and instead, he's lying in a morgue.

624
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,100
Oh... God.

625
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:45,590
No, um... I'm... I'm sorry. I'm
sorry I... I can't... I can't stay.

626
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:48,890
No, it's okay. It's okay. I'll take
care of it. You don't have tstay.

627
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:53,660
Just... I understand. We're all
surgeons. Everyone will understand. I...

628
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,790
- Okay.
- Just go.

629
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:07,330
Might as well take advantage, huh?

630
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,370
What?

631
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:11,710
The party's a dud, but at
least there's free booze, right?

632
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,470
Right.

633
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:20,470
Go ahead and gloat.

634
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:22,880
Surprise parties never come to any good.

635
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,890
I think this party speaks for itself.

636
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,140
I don't get it.

637
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:30,070
You know, the best birthday of my life was
the surprise party that my parents threw.

638
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,930
I... I... I loved it so much.

639
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:35,320
How old were you at this party?

640
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:36,840
7.

641
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:39,890
Like I said, it speaks for itself.

642
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:47,630
If there's... if there's anything that
we can get for you, uh, help you with,

643
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,910
please just... just, uh, let us know.

644
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:53,540
I... I'd be more than happy to oversee any
packing that you need done from his room.

645
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:56,320
I've already arranged for a car if...

646
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,620
it's ready to take you home anytime.

647
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,770
Arizona.

648
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:04,760
Dr. Robbins, this is
a very sensitive time.

649
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,910
Let her be.

650
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,030
- Excuse me?
- I said...

651
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:12,120
Let her be.

652
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:26,500
It just doesn't feel real...

653
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:31,600
any of it. It just... it
just doesn't feel real.

654
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:38,850
Bethany, would you like to see him?

655
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:52,690
I have to admit, I'm impressed.

656
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,390
I never would've pegged you
for the babysitting type.

657
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:56,930
Are you heading home?

658
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,430
No, I got the baby.

659
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:00,160
Well, I'm sure somebody
else could take a shift.

660
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,980
- Do you want me to...
- I can't leave, okay?

661
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:11,340
Are you really so messed up that you
can't let one person be nice to you, ever?

662
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:18,490
I can't go. I can't go home. I
can't get Izzie to call me back.

663
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:23,320
She's... gone, could
be dead for all I know.

664
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:28,260
She left me with a $200, 000
medical bill, and I... I...

665
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:32,810
I can't do anything about it...

666
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:35,110
about any of it.

667
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,670
BuI can sit here and
I can hold this baby.

668
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:40,070
That I can do.

669
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,180
Then I'll sit here with
you for a little while.

670
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,720
Yang.

671
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:04,770
Doctor... can I Cristina
you or are we not there yet?

672
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:06,490
That's a no. Okay.

673
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:12,230
Dr. Yang, let me just tell you that
that was incredibly hot in the O.R.

674
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,650
Yesterday. Very deeply hot.

675
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:15,910
It was hot. You were hot.

676
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:19,140
Uh, you're drunk and you're in my room.

677
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:23,280
I... am, in fact, inebriated.
But that's legal, you know?

678
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:27,610
And even if I wasn't, you're the rule breaker,
which I think we established in surgery.

679
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:30,620
Really, you think that was hot?

680
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,050
Would it be really, really
bad if I just... you know,

681
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:38,250
'cause of the whole embolus
thing and you in general...

682
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:41,230
could I just...

683
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,110
Uh, no. I'm involved.

684
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:48,180
I'm involved.

685
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,330
Time to meet your mommy.

686
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,800
She's so beautiful.

687
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:18,240
They say, the bigger your
investment the bigger your return.

688
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:29,520
Surgery yesterday?

689
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,660
It wasn't just...

690
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,580
it was me.

691
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,050
- Can't you see that?
- See what?

692
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:45,440
See what? I... I can't just
ignore what happened, Cristina.

693
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:53,810
Okay. I'm sorry.

694
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:57,780
Look, I know, um... I
know I overstepped, so...

695
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:03,210
come home with me.

696
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:05,150
Please.

697
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:08,160
But you have to be
willing to take a chance.

698
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,520
Okay.

699
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:46,340
Bad dreams, bad dreams, go away.

700
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:49,660
Good dreams, good dreams, here to stay.

701
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,670
Good dreams, good dreams, here to stay.

702
00:39:57,690 --> 00:40:00,590
Bad dreams, bad dreams, go away.

703
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:03,400
Good dreams, good dreams, here to stay.

704
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:06,090
Bad dreams, bad dreams, go away.

705
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:10,630
Good dreams, good dreams,
here to stay... stay.

706
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,670
You have to do it three times
for it... for it to work.

707
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:25,280
I know. She is the reason...

708
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:33,550
We will stil be giving Seattle
Grace Mercy West $25 million,

709
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,040
not because of you or your ass kissing.

710
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:44,730
It's because of her... her.

711
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,500
You have to understand...

712
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:54,280
You might lose it all.

713
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:02,250
The chief still won't talk to me.

714
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:04,030
Oh, he will.

715
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,470
When did you become such an optimist?

716
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,780
This is married, happy me.

717
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,060
Can we, uh...

718
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,760
Are you okay to...

719
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:14,790
Yes, we can. But if
you take that chance...

720
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,400
- Are you healed?
- I'm healed.

721
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:28,200
If you invest wisely...

722
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,360
the payoff might just surprise you.

723
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,890
I'm awake. I'm aw... um, see?

724
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,440
I'm... I'm totally awake.

725
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:45,140
I'm... there's hats and gifts and...
and... and doughnuts and lingerie.

726
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:50,370
Really?

727
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,710
I love you.

728
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,580
You do?

729
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:03,850
I do.

730
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,080
I love you, too.
