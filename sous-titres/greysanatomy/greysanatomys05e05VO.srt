1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,609
Previously on "grey's anatomy"... I passed?

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:05,489
You're not an intern anymore. George doesn't know I exist.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,919
Do you want to go on a date with me? What if I'm not into it?

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,219
I'm not letting you do this to me, Alex. I know I'm being an ass.

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,789
I think I found a way to save lives. I could find patients

6
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:13,939
For a clinical trial.

7
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,799
The tumor's shrinking. The virus is working.

8
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,619
You keep a diary? It's not mine.

9
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,090
Whose is it? Your mother's.

10
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:23,840
I am a rock.

11
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:26,540
I am an island.

12
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,529
That's the mantra

13
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,500
Of pretty much every surgeon I've ever met.

14
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,000
We like to think we're independent,

15
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:36,420
Loners, mavericks...

16
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,009
That all we need to do our jobs is an o.R., a scalpel

17
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:40,339
And a willing body.

18
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,899
Is Yang on call tonight?

19
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,350
Uh, yeah. Why do you think it's so clean in here?

20
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,249
But the truth is,

21
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,310
Not even the best of us can do it alone.

22
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,980
Surgery, like life, is a team sport.

23
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,350
Can I just say,

24
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,050
The whole "taking it slow" thing?

25
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,580
Best idea ever.

26
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,619
It really takes the pressure off.

27
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,089
Mm. Yeah.

28
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,649
We can just, you know, Hang out without all the--

29
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,150
The expectations.

30
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:07,090
Why rush things? Exactly.

31
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,500
And eventually,

32
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,730
You've got to get off the bench and decide...

33
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,500
What team are you batting for?

34
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,399
You know, one of the joys of cohabitation

35
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,869
Is having breakfast together.

36
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,470
Well, I can't today because Bailey paged us in early.

37
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:38,789
Well, I guess you don't have time

38
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,679
To look at our work in a major medical journal.

39
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,840
They published our clinical trial? Mm-hmm.

40
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,419
It's on the cover.

41
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,700
"a new method in treating inoperable malignant gliomas--

42
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,269
The Shepherd method." what do you think?

43
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:54,180
It's a picture, a big picture of you. You're making a face.

44
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,200
I'm not making a face. I love that picture.

45
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,600
I have to go.

46
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,239
"the Shepherd method." it's about time this hospital

47
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,069
Got some good publicity for a change.

48
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,509
Oh, I heard you found a donor.

49
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,639
Yes, sir. The last piece of the puzzle

50
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,330
Finally fell into place. This is the day, dr. Bailey,

51
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,940
The day that seattle grace comes back swinging.

52
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,489
Shepherd on the front page of a national journal,

53
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,479
Bragging rights to a flashy surgery--

54
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,069
I don't see Mercy West taking on a project of this magnitude,

55
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:24,879
Do you? I'd rather wait to celebrate till we pull this thing off.

56
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,300
Yeah, that's a good call. We don't want to jinx it.

57
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,820
Eat that, Mercy West.

58
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,130
God, I've been looking everywhere for you.

59
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,849
Well, I had an early morning palatoplasty.

60
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,909
You see this? "the Shepherd method"?

61
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,559
Yeah, yeah, very impressive. Listen, last night, Erica--

62
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,499
You think they airbrushed his picture?

63
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,139
I mean, the man does not have one damn

64
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,899
Pore. Could you focus? I need you right now

65
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,519
All right, well, I'm a little exhausted,

66
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,939
But if you want to hop on and do all the work...

67
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,230
No, I need to talk.

68
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:01,670
Last night,

69
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,340
Erica and i... We...

70
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,990
We did it. Sort of.

71
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,379
Congratulations.

72
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,709
No. No, no.

73
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:14,000
It was not good at all.

74
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,440
I choked.

75
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,799
I couldn't go down there.

76
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,499
I-i tried, but it just felt so weird and clinical,

77
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,980
Like gynie rotation.

78
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,549
I left this morning before she got up.

79
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,979
I couldn't even face her.

80
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,819
What if--what if me and Erica are--

81
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,259
What if--what if we were a mistake?

82
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,419
Where are you going? I can't talk about this.

83
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,569
Oh, come on. You love talking about this stuff.

84
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:41,029
Girl on girl. It's hot. Two girls getting nasty and loving it? That's hot.

85
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,049
One girl talking about how much it sucked?

86
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,269
Depressing and wrong.

87
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,830
Just wrong.

88
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,999
The chief wants us to give George one of our interns?

89
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,079
Except for Grey. She already lost O'malley.

90
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,529
Just dump your dead weight. Oh, please. They're all dead weight.

91
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,680
That's why I need all four of them, not three.

92
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,009
George is filling out paperwork,

93
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,429
Getting his real live doctor wings,

94
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,719
So I thought now would be a good time to

95
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,879
Decorate his locker. Give me that coffee

96
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,869
Okay. I don't even want the credit,

97
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,609
But the clinical trial was my idea.

98
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,059
And I had to beg him to do it,

99
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,839
More than once. It's okay you want the credit

100
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,119
I would want the credit. When you screw the attendings, you get screwed.

101
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,970
They have all the power. Interns. You could screw interns.

102
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:29,059
I mean date. Residents could date interns,

103
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,719
'cause we're nonthreatening.

104
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,989
I read this study once that said that interns hardly ever file

105
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:35,979
Sexual harassment claims because we feel so weak and powerless

106
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,180
In the hospital environment, so that's good.

107
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,450
Interns-- the other white meat.

108
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,739
Where are we going? You'll see when we get there.

109
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,729
Dr. Bailey, I'm actually on dr. Sloan's service today.

110
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:52,869
Everyone's off their services. You're all with me. Where are we going?

111
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,759
You'll see when we get there. Hey,

112
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,719
Did you see your locker? I put a smelly candle in it

113
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,529
So now your scrubs are gonna smell like cinnamon bun. Gosh, thanks.

114
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:02,019
Dr. Bailey, dr. Sloan is doing a transpalatal advancement.

115
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,529
I've never seen one. Hahn said I could scrub in on her aortic bypass.

116
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,139
And I really need to get to the clinic. I've staffed it

117
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,279
With nurses and p.A.S, but I'm the only doctor on call,

118
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,509
And I've got administrative work to-- today is not about you.

119
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,719
It is not about whose services you wish to be on.

120
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,019
It's not about your career. This is about me.

121
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,209
This is a project I've been working on for a long time,

122
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,839
And it's very important to me,

123
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,289
Therefore it will be very important to you.

124
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,879
And the only way we can pull this thing off

125
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,489
Is iwe work together as a team,

126
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,609
So today, you are not 15 individual doctors,

127
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,869
You are one team of surgeons representing this hospital.

128
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,400
Is everybody clear othat?

129
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:38,929
Um, why would they need

130
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,029
So many doctors for one surgery? I don't know.

131
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,799
Because it's not just one surgery.

132
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,289
It's 12 surgeries-- 6 kidney transplants

133
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:49,450
In six o.R.S, all at the same time.

134
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,289
Paired matching kidney donation.

135
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:55,669
A 6-way swap-- 6 people donate kidneys

136
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:56,839
To total strangers,

137
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,139
Six people get kidneys from total strangers.

138
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,529
12 people walk away happy.

139
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:04,099
Paired matching kidney donation. Otherwise known as--

140
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,650
Dude, a domino surgery.

141
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,309
Stan Mercer, 46,

142
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,429
Chronic renal failure secondary to high blood pressure.

143
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,889
His wife here wanted to donate a kidney to him,

144
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,049
But she wasn't a match.

145
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,909
So she will be donating her kidney

146
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:31,539
To ms. Chen over there, who is a match,

147
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,299
While mr. Mercer will be getting a kidney

148
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,220
From this young man today. Nice to meet you.

149
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,090
P.J., please.

150
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,769
Uh, Kurt Walling, 58,

151
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,289
Chronic renal failure secondary to diabetes.

152
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:51,429
His son p.J. Wasn't a match, so mr. Walling will be getting

153
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,379
Ms. Herman's kidney today.

154
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,429
Thanks for the kidney, ms. Herman. Oh, call me Lindsay.

155
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,319
We're gonna be pretty close by the end of the day.

156
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,839
And so on and so forth. Why do you still look stupid

157
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,829
Well, maybe if we had a cheat sheet. 

158
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,299
Ms.Herman gives her kidney to mr. Walling

159
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,489
Mr. Walling's son gives his kidney to mr. Mercer.

160
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,619
Mr. Mercer's wife gives her kidney to ms. Chen.

161
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,249
Ms. Chen's sister gives her kidney to mr. Patel.

162
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,919
Mr. Patel's wife gives her kidney to ms. Loring,

163
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,849
Who came in with her cousin, ms. Gomez, who's giving

164
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,649
Her kidney to mr. Cross, the professional

165
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:19,019
Flautist. For those of you without a photographic memory

166
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,309
It's up on a board in the conference room. And why do we have to do

167
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:26,159
All x transplants at one time? So no one backs out at the last minute.

168
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,939
Why would anybody back out? It's such an incredible thing

169
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,409
To be a part of. Well, passing the organ's kinda creepy. I'd back out.

170
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,149
Yeah, yeah, that's why this whole surgery

171
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,869
Is a giant house of cards. If we lose one donor,

172
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:37,209
We lose them all. So you will not only provide

173
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:39,309
Excellent medical care, but you will keep

174
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,229
Your patients happy.

175
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,069
We need to make sure this whole thing doesn't fall apart

176
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,959
Before the surgery. Any questions? Um,

177
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,059
I heard when the did a domino at boston gen

178
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,869
The residents all got to keep one of the dead kidneys

179
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,739
In a jar aa souvenir. I want a kidney in a jar.

180
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,089
Me, too, can I have a kidney? Well, if they get kidneys, I get a kidney.

181
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,699
Quantities are limited. I asked first.

182
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,120
Can we? No one is taking home a kidney in a jar

183
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,129
Diseased kidneys

184
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,569
Are not tchotchkes for your coffee table.

185
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:02,440
Now go. Go.

186
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,410
Hey, you okay?

187
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,969
Uh, Bailey snagged

188
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,669
All the surgical residents and interns,

189
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,969
So I'm stuck with the psych interns.

190
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,709
Not the sharpest. Okay, you're busy. I'll be brief.

191
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:21,399
I was thinking, if you weren't on call tonight,

192
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,399
That, uh, maybe we could, uh, go to my place,

193
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,780
Order in dinner, rent a movie.

194
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:30,500
Tonight? You want to get together again tonight?

195
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,709
Well, I had a lot of fun last night. Fun.

196
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,520
Anyway, just let me know.

197
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,269
Okay, as you may know, one of you is going

198
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,879
To O'malley today. Oh, me! I-i'll go if you need a volunteer.

199
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,129
I decide who gets to go after I decide

200
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,999
Which one of you sucks the most.

201
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,490
And you better not suck on purpose, because I will know.

202
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,279
Honey, would you like your book or some music,

203
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,589
Something to help you relax? I don't know. Maybe some water.

204
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,449
How about some ice chips instead?

205
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,349
Your ankles are looking a little thick.

206
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,870
My wife loves tracking my fluid retention.

207
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,569
And, Megan, will you please come over here

208
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,749
And tape the needles so we n start dialis?

209
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,710
Sounds just like a real doctor.

210
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,419
Uh, it says here that you don't have a loved one

211
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,159
In the domino, ms. Herman. No.

212
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,159
So you're just donating a kidney to a complete stranger

213
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,660
For nothing in return? It's really no big deal.

214
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,339
I have two kidneys, and they say you can live with one, so...

215
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,439
Are you kidding? That's amazing, what you're doing.

216
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,079
U.N.O.S. Is always short on organs.

217
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,959
If everyone in the world did this-- yeah,

218
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,679
It'd be all peace and love and unicorns

219
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,649
She gets it, Grey.

220
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,920
I'm so sick of all the "yay, you."

221
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,050
I totally understand.

222
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,569
Oh. The chief has got me doing press all day

223
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:47,609
With journalists.

224
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,309
My face is starting to hurt from smiling.

225
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:52,589
Uh-huh. I already pushed that. It comes faster when I push it.

226
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:55,380
Oh, must be that Shepherd method. Funny.

227
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,219
I think I'll take the stairs.

228
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:00,439
Meredith, are you bothered by this? Why would I be bothered?

229
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,459
You can't call it the Shepherd-grey method

230
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,750
Because then people would ink you had help.

231
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,149
So do I really have to give my kidney to that old guy?

232
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,390
Mr. Mercer couldn't be more than 50. My son's 22.

233
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,249
To him, everyone over 40 is on the brink of death.

234
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,850
Turned 23 in august. Oh, that's right.

235
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:20,469
Maybe we could have a little belated party

236
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,699
Here in the hospital, get you an ice cream cake.

237
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,709
You used to love those. Yeah, when I was 7.

238
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:26,879
Look, I'm not here for a reunion.

239
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,169
I just want to get this over with

240
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:32,699
And get out of here, okay? So you are on dialysis four times a week now?

241
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,619
They might as well chain me to the machine at this point.

242
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,779
My kidneys are shot. I'm living on borrowed time.

243
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:42,249
So I'm pretty lucky to have a son who would do this for me.

244
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,820
You're lucky you're loaded.

245
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,289
So when do I get the 10,000 bucks,

246
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,910
Before or after the surgery?

247
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,420
It's a Christmas gift.

248
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:55,120
Well, it's october.

249
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,440
I see you two hovering.

250
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,119
Hypothetically, say a patient

251
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,519
Was... Paying his son for a kidney,

252
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,960
What exactly would happen?

253
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,099
Paying money for a kidney?

254
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,360
Hypothetically.

255
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:26,409
Well, as someone who stole an organ herself

256
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:27,609
Not that long ago,

257
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:29,529
You should know, what would happen

258
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:32,550
Is your patient would be out of the exchange.

259
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,679
Which means that this person,

260
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,659
Since her husband's no longer getting a kidney,

261
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,880
Would drop out.

262
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:43,329
Then they would drop out, then they would drop out,

263
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:44,919
Then the whole thing would fall apart.

264
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,429
That's what would happen. So if you both are suggesting

265
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,879
That that's what's going on here,

266
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,300
You'd better be damn sure about it.

267
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:55,909
It's just a gift.

268
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,780
Uh, an early stocking stuffer.

269
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,349
Most girls your age, they're busy shopping.

270
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,109
You're in the hospital giving a kidney to a stranger.

271
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,609
Oh, I'm not such a saint.

272
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:08,659
Your kidney may not be going directly to my husband,

273
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,719
But you're one of the people saving his life today.

274
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,409
To me, your mother teresa. Honey, would you mind running

275
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,639
And getting a wet washcloth for me?

276
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,120
I'm just-- oh, yeah, of course. Excuse me

277
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,200
Thank you.

278
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,069
You know, my mother invented the Grey method all by herself.

279
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,349
You know, maybe you should stop reading her diary.

280
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,080
It's gonna make you feel inadequate.

281
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,040
She's dead and in the past and still outpacing me.

282
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,760
Okay, see, see that intern over there? Is he clean?

283
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:36,519
Huh? What? Well, I was just thinking, what Lexopedia said,

284
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,299
And, you know, she may be on to

285
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,149
Something. You're gonna sleep with an intern

286
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,370
It'd just be scratching the itch.

287
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,749
It's been a long time.

288
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,529
I can't do this. All these people telling me

289
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,389
How wonderful and selfless and giving I am--

290
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,599
I-i can take it anymore, especially not

291
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,099
From her. All right, just keep your voice down

292
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,479
Did you see her face, thanking me for saving your life?

293
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,259
Stan, this is crazy.

294
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,829
You promised you would tell her. Please!

295
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,789
Ah. Mr. Mercer, is everything okay?

296
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,689
No, I don't feel so good, actually. Tell her!

297
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:05,509
If the past three years have meant anything to you,

298
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:06,830
You have to tell her!

299
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,240
Stan?

300
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,669
I'm not an idiot. I know there have been other women.

301
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:16,950
All these years, I told myself it was just sex. It's just...

302
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,829
My god, Stan. She's giving a kidney for you.

303
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:22,199
That--that's not sex. It's family.

304
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,279
All right, his, uh, cardiac enzymes and e.K.G. Look good.

305
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,159
He had an acute anxiety attack. I can clear him for surgery.

306
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,460
I do everything for you.

307
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,819
I've given up my entire life to get you to dialysis,

308
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,210
Drive you to the doctors-- I didn't ask you to do any of that.

309
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:39,199
I can drive a car. I can pour my own juice.

310
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,199
I got sick, not elderly.

311
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,590
Well, don't worry.

312
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,170
I won't do one more thing for you,

313
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,570
And that includes giving a kidney.

314
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,399
Get on the phone with u.N.O.S.

315
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,289
Tell them we need a kidney

316
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,299
That matches mrs. Mercer's antibodies.

317
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,469
U.N.O.S. Is a long shot.

318
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,680
It's only shot we have. Go, now.

319
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:09,829
She's barely a second-year resident. I made the virus. She assisted.

320
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:12,989
When Michael jordan scores, no one cares about the assist.

321
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:15,359
I don't know. Scottie pippen... You know what I mean.

322
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,299
These women, they overthink everything.

323
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,899
Somebody's cranky today. What is that?

324
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,109
"experimental treatments for cleft palates."

325
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:26,079
Huh. You're working on your own clinical trial, aren't you?

326
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,879
I'm--i'm jt-- I'm doing a little research.

327
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,940
Mm-hmm. See, the very sight of me

328
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,589
Reminds you that you've not made

329
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,449
One worthwhile contribution to medical history,

330
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,660
Doesn't it?

331
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,529
Get out. You should read my article.

332
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:38,899
It will enrich your life,

333
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,890
Make you a better man. I'm saving it for the bathroom

334
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,530
It started as an office thing,

335
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,910
You know, light, fun.

336
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,589
And then one day you wake up,

337
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:53,870
And...  This older guy is all you can think about.

338
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,540
You'd do anything for him,

339
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,170
Even give a kidney.

340
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,090
Why?

341
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,920
I could save his life, too.

342
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,609
I mean, she may be married to him,

343
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:10,620
But... I'm saving his life today, too.

344
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,390
So then he'll finally have to choose.

345
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,940
Her or me?

346
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:26,179
Apparently, Erica loved it, the non-sex sex.

347
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,579
I think she might want more. Happens to me all the time with women.

348
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,459
I barely remember it, their minds are blown. That's your sage advice?

349
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,839
I'm a world-class surgeon,

350
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,379
Double boarded in plastics and e.N.T.

351
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,989
I have more meaningful and worthwhile things to do

352
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:39,450
Than dispense sex advice. Yeah, like what?

353
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,820
Nice. Oh, come on. No, Mark, I need your help.

354
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:49,580
Excuse me.

355
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,050
What is going on?

356
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,689
Trying to decide which of our interns

357
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,439
To give to georg in front of us.

358
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,249
They're deciding in front of us, like livestock at a state fair.

359
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,969
I think I'll keep Lexopedia. She remembers many things.

360
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,829
Mm-hmm. And she bathes,

361
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,910
Which is much more than I can say for...

362
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,409
Stinky two over there.

363
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:13,629
You smell. Well, Graciella charts like crap.

364
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:16,949
But she can put in a line. Claire, on the other Hand,

365
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:19,650
Nearly castrated a guy with a catheter. Mm.

366
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,989
We can hear you. I might dump Pierce.

367
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:25,659
Ooh, how does he suck? I just hate saying the name Pierce.

368
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,249
Mm. We should revolt.

369
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,249
They'd respect us more if we didn't participate

370
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,340
In our own humiliation. Yeah.

371
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,599
You revolt first, and I'll follow.

372
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,939
Hey, have you heard from u.N.O.S. Yet?

373
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,439
They're still searching for a match

374
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,669
But so far, nothing.

375
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,529
I hope they come through. My guy really needs a kidney

376
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:41,999
Yeah, they all need kidneys, Izzie.

377
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,939
If Derek needed a kidney, I wouldn't give him one

378
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,099
He'd take the credit.

379
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,089
He'd say he magically grew it himself.

380
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,080
My guy's been sick for 15 years.

381
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,909
Can you imagine having your life on hold like that?

382
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,680
Plus, he's got such a crappy kid.

383
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:56,920
Hey! Did I say you could put that down?

384
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:01,330
No, so pick it up.

385
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,360
Weak. No stamina. Yeah, but he takes orders.

386
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,440
True. True.

387
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,689
Is my husband getting a kidney or not? Wait, what about my sister?

388
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:14,979
If she's not getting a kidney today,

389
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,199
Am not giving mine to some stranger.

390
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,769
I will do my best to make sure everyone gets a kidney today.

391
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:23,690
I'll update you as soon as I have information. Please.

392
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,289
Sir, i--i've got this under control.

393
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:29,649
I have Grey talking with u.N.O.S. I have--

394
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:32,319
We are being featured on the national news.

395
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,610
All eyes are on seattle grace.

396
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,919
Fix this.

397
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,330
Yes, sir.

398
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:43,590
I have been poked and prodded like a lab rat,

399
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,130
What, all for nothing?

400
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,169
We got to spend time with each other.

401
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,439
That's not nothing.

402
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,769
Oh, oh, now you want to spend time together?

403
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,959
Well, you're about 20 years too late.

404
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,960
So, yeah, nothing.

405
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,209
P.J... Do I still get the $10,000 if the surgery doesn't happen?

406
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:02,939
'cause if not, I'm outta here. I have a life to get back to.

407
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,230
Please. I need you.

408
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,230
If you could... Just be patient a little bit longer...

409
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:20,719
I was gonna punch that kid.

410
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,189
I mean, what kind of a selfish idiot--

411
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,349
His father is sick, he's really sick,

412
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:26,349
And all he cares about is his stupid money.

413
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,969
All right, the guy must have done something really ba

414
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:30,599
To make the kid so angry. Maybe he just cares about his son,

415
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,709
But the moron is too emotionally stunted to let him.

416
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,809
Okay, uh, I'm--i'm--

417
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:38,059
I'm trying to be, uh... I am,

418
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,159
But this right here?

419
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,690
This--this-- this is exactly your problem.

420
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,179
You get all wrapped up and involved and you just--

421
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,790
You start--you start caring about these people.

422
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:49,029
Your patient in there, he's the moron.

423
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,459
His son's never gonna give him what he wants,

424
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,879
And he's just gonna be disappointed.

425
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,530
And the sooner he gets that, the sooner you get it...

426
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,780
No, go on, please.

427
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,249
Be a selfish ass.

428
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,799
'cause at least then I know what to expect.

429
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,339
'cause this being a decent guy one second

430
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,969
And a total jerk the next, it's getting really old, Alex.

431
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:10,300
So who's it gonna be? Pick one.

432
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:19,110
O'malley. 'sup, bud? It's doctor.

433
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,689
Hey. Missed you at lunch today.

434
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,119
It was an all-new level of hell.

435
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,399
Oh, no, I was busy doing my own charts.

436
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,909
The interns don't respect me. I would respect you if I was your intern.

437
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,039
George, they don't respect you

438
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,589
Because they're not scared of you.

439
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,259
Just decimate one every few days.

440
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,980
It's not rocket science. Two.

441
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,090
Who's getting, uh, ms. Herman's kidney?

442
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:43,889
Uh, I can-- I can go check.

443
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,770
Three? Mr. Walling.

444
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,819
That's right. No. I totally forgot.

445
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:50,229
You forgot.

446
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,340
Like you forgot to do your notes before rounds?

447
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,320
Or like you forgot to pull the drain on my post-op s.B.O.?

448
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,209
Or like you forgot to sign all your dictation,

449
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:00,470
So all your charts-- uh, my charts--are delinquent?

450
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:02,820
You forgot...

451
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,559
Because the only thing you can retain

452
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,940
In that pea-sized brain of yours is what time lunch is.

453
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,240
Grey here is gonna become a surgeon

454
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:13,860
While you dig ditches by the side of the road.

455
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,350
It's brutal, but it's effective.

456
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,379
I am not gonna do this with you.

457
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,239
Do what? Have this silent fight.

458
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,529
I'm gonna write the editors

459
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,160
And have them print a correction--

460
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,839
The Shepherd-grey method. I don't want you to give me credit

461
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,219
Because you're mad that I'm mad.

462
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,419
I want you to give me credit

463
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,699
Because you think I worked hard for it and I deserve it.

464
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,780
You don't deserve it. You're a baby.

465
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,129
You have the potential to be a good surgeon,

466
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:46,340
Maybe a great one.

467
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,129
But you haven't even scratched the surface

468
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:51,930
On what you need to learn. It was my idea.

469
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:55,310
And I hate that picture.

470
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:04,100
U.N.O.S. Doesn't have a match.

471
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,230
Okay.

472
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,270
Uh, we can, um...

473
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:19,169
We've been stalling. We haven't released anyone.

474
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:21,269
I can talk to ms. Mercer--

475
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:24,290
You can't do anything that could be seen as coercion.

476
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,429
U.N.O.S. Is very clear. But, sir--

477
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:27,499
The last thing we need

478
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,870
Is to lose our status as a transplant center.

479
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:35,150
Let the patients go home.

480
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:39,770
It's over.

481
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:57,120
I've got a cabg in an hour. Want to get some coffee?

482
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,790
I'm not cut out for this.

483
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,069
Coffee?

484
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:05,219
No, this, the--the touching and the... Sex with a girl.

485
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:08,029
I just--i-i can't do it. I thought I could but...

486
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:11,060
But you did do it. I don't understand.

487
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,540
It wasn't good for you.

488
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,600
I can't believe it.

489
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:34,119
I got so close.

490
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,849
You're gonna be pretty high on the transplant list.

491
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:37,699
Something else will come up.

492
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,080
It's not the kidney I'm upset about.

493
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,640
Oh. Your son.

494
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,540
We hadn'spoken in over a year.

495
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:47,080
It took me months to find him.

496
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,070
This was my chance to get him back.

497
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,350
Right.

498
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:54,130
I know p.J. Can be selfish...

499
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:55,970
Rude...

500
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,180
But it hasn't been easy for him.

501
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,370
His mom died.

502
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,800
I worked late most nights.

503
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,399
I made a lot of mistakes.

504
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,000
You can't blame yourself.

505
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,910
Some people are just broken.

506
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:17,770
I guess you just try not to care too much.

507
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,540
Then you can't be disappointed.

508
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:26,520
These are, uh, your discharge papers.

509
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,200
I'm sorry.

510
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:40,170
I don't know why I'm...

511
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,980
I'm sorry.

512
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:50,400
I'm so sorry.

513
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,050
It's okay.

514
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:04,459
Now all you have to do is sign there at the bottom,

515
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,990
And you're free to go.

516
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:11,050
You must think I'm a terrible person...

517
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,080
Refusing to give my kidney.

518
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:16,329
We're not thinking anything, ma'am.

519
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,720
He's taken everything.

520
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:22,810
My love, my pride, my dignity--

521
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,820
It's all gone.

522
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:28,120
But the one thing that he doesn't have is the kidney.

523
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:33,080
And the thought of giving him that last part of me...

524
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:38,640
You must think I'm a terrible person.

525
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:40,829
I'm not allowed to think anything.

526
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,729
There are rules that prevent me

527
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:44,560
From having an opinion here--

528
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,919
Good rules, rules in place for a reason--

529
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,799
Because giving an organ

530
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,579
That god put in your body to someone else

531
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:56,040
Isn't something that you can be coerced into doing.

532
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:59,930
It is... A big thing.

533
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,789
It is an extraordinary thing.

534
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:06,200
It's a gift that must be freely given.

535
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,859
And if you were to give it, and I'm not asking you to,

536
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,339
But if you were to give it,

537
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,789
It's not just for your husband.

538
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,999
It's for five other people,

539
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,610
People that you don't know from adam.

540
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:43,530
Our six donors are all anesthetized and ready to go.

541
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:46,240
They'll be done first, followed by the recipients.

542
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,249
Each pair will be color-coded so as not to confuse them.

543
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:52,020
This surgery is a hornet's nest, people,

544
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:54,079
So work quickly but carefully.

545
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,080
Use each other. Operate as a team.

546
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,350
Let's go make medical history.

547
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,319
We're lucky as hell that woman changed her mind.

548
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,800
Yes, we are. Yes, we are.

549
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:24,490
Huh. Now that's what I call a nice-looking kidney.

550
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:34,509
Put that on ice

551
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,920
And start flushing in the preservation solution.

552
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:10,290
You want to do the honors, dr. Yang?

553
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,230
Good.

554
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:21,019
That's quite a geyser of urine, sir.

555
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,779
That means we did our job right.

556
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,730
You never get tired of seeing that.

557
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:28,080
We're ready for you, Grey.

558
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,090
Walking with the kidney.

559
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,280
5-second rule! 5-second rule!

560
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:50,179
I'm gonna need more ice, uh, and another tie.

561
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:50,809
I'll get it.

562
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,830
No, you don't touc anything else.

563
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:56,540
Someone dropped a damn kidney?

564
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,079
I know you don't want to talk about it anymore.

565
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,039
I know you're over it. Oh, for the love of god.

566
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,510
Just hear me out.

567
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:13,240
I like to be good at things, okay?

568
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,200
I do not fail.

569
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,660
I do not quit.

570
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:20,669
I like to be good at things, and I want to be good at this.

571
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:23,370
So... I need you.

572
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:26,980
I need you to show me.

573
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:31,409
Show you?

574
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,289
Just because you didn't publish a big clinical trial

575
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:35,460
Doesn't mean you're not a genius.

576
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:42,089
Fine. Take off your pants.

577
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:44,840
Really? Oh, my god. Thank you.

578
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,769
Thank you so much.

579
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:48,550
I'll show you the Sloan method.

580
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,760
Won't ever be in a medical journal,

581
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,840
But it should.

582
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:59,489
Shouldn't it be pinking up by now?

583
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:01,220
It's just getting venous blood.

584
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,610
Let's check the back side again.

585
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:05,349
I don't know.

586
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:08,340
I think I see... A little pink, maybe.

587
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,420
Ah, come on, come on.

588
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:14,340
All right.

589
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,440
Come on.

590
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:19,420
Come on, pink up.

591
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,829
Come on.

592
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:25,080
Pink up, pink up, pink up, pink up.

593
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,900
Come on.

594
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,039
Yes. Yeah, it looks good.

595
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,480
We have a live kidney.

596
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:48,289
Oh, come on. I am offering two interns.

597
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:50,159
Two interns for the price of one--come on.

598
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,579
I'll trade you Laura for both of 'em.

599
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:55,470
Leo drains pus and likes it. I dropped an internal organ...

600
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,460
On the floor.

601
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,749
It happens.

602
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:02,169
Okay, okay. Uh, how about this?

603
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:05,270
Four goes to George. I get James.

604
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:07,819
Karev, you get two. Izzie, give Leo.

605
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,420
What are you people doing?

606
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:15,139
We were just, uh, just deciding which of our interns

607
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,419
To give to George. Mm-hmm.

608
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,869
Oh, you think I got to choose my interns,

609
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:20,099
And I picked you people

610
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:23,159
'cause you're all such a surgical dream team?

611
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,899
You--you're lazy. You're whiny.

612
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:29,009
Butterfingers overhere is downright depressing,

613
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:32,540
And you, Yang, you-- you're just annoying.

614
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,500
Choosing their own interns...

615
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:36,730
What are--what...

616
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,290
Give me those damn cards.

617
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,070
O'malley...

618
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,530
You have interns.

619
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:51,550
What is it?

620
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:56,869
Okay, open his fluids.

621
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:59,949
Karev, push a gram of mag. Do a c.B.C. And electrolytes.

622
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,979
Stevens, uh, order a color flow doppler

623
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,869
And do a full neuro workup. You think there's a bleed?

624
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:07,840
There's no way of knowing till we evaluate everything. Where is... P.J.?

625
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:09,320
Where's my son?

626
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:15,700
Stan had better be dead right now.

627
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,040
He's doing fine.

628
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:20,000
He hasn't called my room.

629
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,900
Just lay back.

630
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:23,780
He hasn't asked for me.

631
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,850
It's been three years.

632
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,609
I gave a kidney for him,

633
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:33,100
And he still hasn't made a choice.

634
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,160
He hasn't asked about you

635
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:42,060
Or called.

636
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,840
I think he's made a choice.

637
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,660
But I gave a kidney for him.

638
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,210
I gave a kidney.

639
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,470
Oh, my god.

640
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,409
Hey, man, the nurse was supposed to bring my dinner

641
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:14,110
Like an hour ago. Your dad just had a seizure.

642
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:17,049
Okay. So what does that mean?

643
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:20,949
It means something's wrong. It means he could be dying,

644
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:22,579
And he doesn't know you give a crap.

645
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,359
Honestly, he doesn't know, and maybe you don't,

646
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,549
But if you do, he's dying, and you're gonna be too late. Alex, stop.

647
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:29,579
He's asking for you, and you're gonna be too late,

648
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,660
And you're gonna live with it for the rest of your life!

649
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:35,130
You really want to live with that, huh? Do you? Alex! Alex.

650
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:47,579
So tomorrow we'll meet, uh, one hour before pre-rounds.

651
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,740
Dude, that's, like, 4:00 a.M.

652
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:50,699
Dr. Stevens

653
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,339
Never made us come in before pre-rounds.

654
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,120
Yeah, O'malley, you gotta chill.

655
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,430
They probably should say dr. O'malley.

656
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:04,349
So those are your interns? Did you even ask for me?

657
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,059
What?

658
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,360
I helped you study.

659
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,229
I helped decorate your stupid locker.

660
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:12,900
I-nd you didn't--

661
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,850
You don't-- you don't even see it.

662
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,170
You don't see anything.

663
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:21,550
I am such an idiot.

664
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,800
And you are a jerk.

665
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:29,780
You didn't even think to ask for me?

666
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:37,350
Screw you, dr. O'malley.

667
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:48,679
Ms. Loring and mr. Mercer, they're all stable.

668
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:52,059
But mr. Walling, he has delayed graft function

669
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:55,579
And god knows what else. Ah, the press is gonna be all over this tomorrow.

670
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,889
And I'll need you Available for interviews and some photo-ops.

671
00:33:57,890 --> 00:34:00,229
Make sure you wear your nice scrubs. Did you hear me, sir?

672
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:03,019
Mr. Walling--he has a serious complication.

673
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:07,579
His electrolytes are off, his crit's down. But you saved five other lives.

674
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,710
That's a pretty good scorecard. Not perfect, but good.

675
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:20,419
I told you. I don't want to see Stan.

676
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,440
I'm not taking you to see Stan.

677
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,269
Oh, this is her.

678
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:31,150
This is the woman who gave me her kidney.

679
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,200
Nice to meet you. Thanks so much.

680
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:07,509
How's she doing?

681
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:08,689
I'm keeping a close eye on her,

682
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,620
But so far, she's completely stable.

683
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:14,050
Come with me.

684
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:23,700
This man is very ill,

685
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,250
Maybe dying.

686
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,779
He's got a perfect, healthy donor kidney

687
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,890
That wasn't dropped on the floor.

688
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,730
There's only so much we can help...

689
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,520
And so much we can hurt.

690
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,940
Forgive yourself.

691
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:54,750
Visiting hours are over.

692
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,560
It's okay.

693
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:08,770
Dad...

694
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:29,259
Your urine output is up to 25 cc's per hour.

695
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,690
That should make you happy.

696
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:32,250
My wife would've been happy.

697
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,910
Who's gonna care about my urine output now?

698
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:44,760
Well, things are gonna be a little different.

699
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,729
Ah, dr. Bailey.

700
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:58,219
I heard your big surgery went well today.

701
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,059
Congratulations.

702
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,239
Same to you.

703
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,840
Must feel good to see your name in print like that.

704
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,769
It would feel better if Meredith wasn't so--

705
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:08,049
You know, she's acting silly about the credit.

706
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:11,139
She's getting emotional. That girl worked her ass off for you,

707
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:14,779
And you got all the credit. I would've gotten all the blame had we failed.

708
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,739
But you didn't fail.

709
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:18,599
It's simple. I'm an attending. She's a second-year resident.

710
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,820
Who you're now living with. That's not simple. It's messy.

711
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,670
If it were me, I'd start with "thank you."

712
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,799
You'd be surprised how far that one goes,

713
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,690
Especially with us silly, emotional women.

714
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:38,249
So Derek said that I was a baby. What?

715
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:42,109
And that I had a lot to learn. Whatever.

716
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:44,959
I mean, not whatever. He's right. I did drop a kidney.

717
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,669
And don't say it happens, because it doesn't.

718
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:50,409
But I do hate it when he's right. No, okay, he is not right.

719
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:52,639
Stop caring so much about what he thinks.

720
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,979
It makes you seem desperate.

721
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,879
Okay, to the one trolling for interns.

722
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,200
Yeah, I changed my mind.

723
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:00,620
Interns are weak. I don't want weak.

724
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:04,290
You know, Burke was a man.

725
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:08,960
He was a man.

726
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:14,150
Joe.

727
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:16,870
I think, uh, we need another round.

728
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,429
Hey, Joe. How you doing?

729
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:22,930
Excuse me. Here you go.

730
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,839
Wh--ho-- is this for me? Yes.

731
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,880
Hey, honey. I brought you Roses. Let me back in the house.

732
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:33,980
Oh, no. Mm. Yes.

733
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:35,899
Holy crap. What the hell is that thing?

734
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,249
Oh, that is a kidney in a jar. That's not fair.

735
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,299
How did you get that? Well,

736
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,909
Being an incredibly important, fancy neurosurgeo

737
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:43,179
Has its perks.

738
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,290
Thank you.

739
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,640
I couldn't have done it without you,

740
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:50,330
Not one surgery, not one patient.

741
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:54,860
I couldn't have done any of it without you. Thanks.

742
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,089
Yeah, could you guys go ahead and get this thing

743
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:59,189
The hell out of here before people start to freak out? Okay.

744
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:03,749
Okay. Um, are you gonna be okay? Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

745
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,489
All right. Good night. Good night.

746
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:06,069
Good night, Joe.

747
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:08,390
The thing about choosing teams in real life,

748
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:11,210
It's nothing like it used to be in gym class.

749
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:19,690
Being first pick can be terrifying.

750
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,390
Take off your pants.

751
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:22,999
Excuse me?

752
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,100
Take off... Your pants.

753
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:29,110
We're trying this again.

754
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,070
And being chosen last...

755
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,970
Isn't the worst thing in the world.

756
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:45,110
What?

757
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,380
I care about you.

758
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:53,849
I care about you, and I'm not gonna go crazy,

759
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,850
And I'm not gonna try to kill myself,

760
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:58,079
And I'm not gonna stop caring about you,

761
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,130
No matter how hard you push me away.

762
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:02,509
Shut up and get out of my room.

763
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,540
No.

764
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,290
I care about you.

765
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,279
And I know you care about me, too.

766
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,980
It is not too late for us.

767
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:11,639
Get out of my room.

768
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,889
Admit it. Admit that you care about me, too.

769
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:18,900
I know you do, and I care about you.

770
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:21,570
I care about you.

771
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,029
I care about you.

772
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:26,769
I care about you. I care about you.

773
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:27,980
I--

774
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:32,340
So we watch from the sidelines,

775
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,410
Clinging to our isolation...

776
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:40,020
It glows.

777
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,130
Yeah.

778
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:48,780
When my mother was a resident, she wasn't dropping kidneys.

779
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,490
You're reading your mom's diary?

780
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:55,680
I'm not half the surgeon my mother was.

781
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:09,130
Because we know as soon as we let go of the bench...

782
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:11,250
What, are you leaving already?

783
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:13,910
There are no real men left in the world, Joe.

784
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,540
See you.

785
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:19,640
Hey, shot and a beer. Uh, whiskey.

786
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,779
You know what? Better make it just the beer.

787
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,570
I start work tomorrow.

788
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,189
Someone comes along

789
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:27,540
And changes the game completely.
