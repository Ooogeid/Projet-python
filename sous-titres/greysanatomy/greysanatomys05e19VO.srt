1
00:00:03,774 --> 00:00:05,625
Surgeons are all messed up.

2
00:00:05,645 --> 00:00:10,029
We're butchers, messed-up knife-happy butchers.

3
00:00:21,528 --> 00:00:24,415
Sir, would you like a card set up for you in her room?

4
00:00:24,722 --> 00:00:27,257
We cut people up. We move on.

5
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:30,044
Patients die on our watch. We move on.

6
00:00:30,064 --> 00:00:32,364
No. I'm a doctor here.

7
00:00:34,427 --> 00:00:37,475
We cause trauma. We suffer trauma.

8
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,655
Wait.

9
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:48,227
And here it comes.

10
00:00:55,153 --> 00:00:57,986
We don't have time to worry about how all the blood, and death,

11
00:00:57,986 --> 00:00:59,675
and crap really makes us feel.

12
00:01:00,663 --> 00:01:02,523
This is how you went wine

13
00:01:02,543 --> 00:01:05,865
By watching two hours straight advanced coronary artery.

14
00:01:07,129 --> 00:01:08,069
Christina?

15
00:02:02,438 --> 00:02:04,309
Everything OK?

16
00:02:06,463 --> 00:02:08,917
Christina! Hunt!

17
00:02:30,662 --> 00:02:31,716
Three in the morning.

18
00:02:31,717 --> 00:02:34,353
Christina, this better be good...

19
00:02:35,237 --> 00:02:36,551
Callie.

20
00:02:40,181 --> 00:02:44,197
What? He what?

21
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:46,268
It's me. Christina.

22
00:02:52,855 --> 00:02:53,929
What's going on?

23
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:56,400
Owen's out there upset. Callie was screaming.

25
00:02:59,897 --> 00:03:00,787
I'm fine.

26
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:03,319
- I'm Fine, I'm fine, I'm fine. - Oh, my god. your neck!

27
00:03:03,339 --> 00:03:04,709
- I will kill him. - No.

28
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:06,519
It was a nightmare. He had a nightmare.

29
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:08,789
Christina, please.

30
00:03:09,825 --> 00:03:12,168
She all right? I just need to know if She is all right.

31
00:03:12,188 --> 00:03:13,450
No. No. No. No.

32
00:03:13,785 --> 00:03:15,094
Christina. No.

33
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:21,023
I am so sorry.

34
00:03:24,535 --> 00:03:25,432
I don't know what happened. I'm ...

35
00:03:25,432 --> 00:03:30,160
I don't know what happened. I'm sorry.

36
00:03:30,266 --> 00:03:32,492
- Look at me. - I'm sorry.

37
00:03:32,492 --> 00:03:33,602
Look at me.

38
00:03:34,862 --> 00:03:36,970
I'm fine.

39
00:03:37,295 --> 00:03:39,015
See? It's OK.

40
00:03:39,035 --> 00:03:41,168
You were asleep. It's OK. OK?

41
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:42,558
It's OK. It's OK.

42
00:03:42,558 --> 00:03:47,307
- I'm sorry. - It's OK. I know.

43
00:03:48,556 --> 00:03:52,679
It's OK. You were asleep. It's OK...

44
00:03:53,713 --> 00:03:56,574
It's OK. It's OK.

45
00:04:09,626 --> 00:04:11,459
Here's coffee.

46
00:04:23,787 --> 00:04:26,037
No. I don't like this.

47
00:04:30,317 --> 00:04:32,644
Today is your first day back to the hospital.

48
00:04:32,681 --> 00:04:33,782
Today is about Izzie.

49
00:04:33,802 --> 00:04:35,508
You have to operate on her brain.

50
00:04:36,304 --> 00:04:37,569
You have a gift.

51
00:04:39,585 --> 00:04:41,511
And you can do this.

52
00:04:46,336 --> 00:04:48,634
I'll get a shower before I go there.

53
00:04:58,149 --> 00:05:00,263
You're wearing a turtleneck under your scrubs.

54
00:05:00,283 --> 00:05:01,215
It's ugly.

55
00:05:02,258 --> 00:05:04,227
Not as ugly as the fact you hugged him.

56
00:05:05,118 --> 00:05:07,980
- you hugged him. - I get it. Hear you. Let's move on.

57
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,565
Turtlenecks aren't OK.

58
00:05:09,585 --> 00:05:11,448
You're not OK, and your boyfriend's not OK.

59
00:05:11,468 --> 00:05:13,320
- Is your boyfriend OK? - What?

60
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,406
To be cutting into brains today.

61
00:05:15,426 --> 00:05:17,671
- Is he OK to be back? - Yes. Of course.

62
00:05:17,691 --> 00:05:18,900
Derek is fine.

63
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,930
I was there for his carnage in the OR. Remember?

64
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,780
This isn't just any patient today.

65
00:05:23,088 --> 00:05:24,167
This is Izzie.

66
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:36,408
George. Hey.

67
00:05:36,428 --> 00:05:38,099
I'm surprised you're not...

68
00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:40,742
I mean isn't there a big presentation happening with Izzie?

69
00:05:40,762 --> 00:05:42,063
I didn't even know she was sick.

70
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,283
Bailey told me after Christina told her.

71
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:45,379
Izzie trusted Christina.

72
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,815
I was the very last to know.

73
00:05:46,835 --> 00:05:49,239
Well, I'm sure Izzie wasn't trying...

74
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:50,194
I don't even want to talk about it anymore.

75
00:05:50,214 --> 00:05:50,685
What I wanna do is work.

76
00:05:50,686 --> 00:05:52,099
You have any room on your service?

77
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:55,827
- Yeah. I have three hip replacements on ?? - Thank you.

78
00:06:01,396 --> 00:06:02,976
You three.

79
00:06:02,976 --> 00:06:04,703
OK. I understand why you're here.

80
00:06:04,703 --> 00:06:05,767
I know you wanna help.

81
00:06:06,094 --> 00:06:07,681
But I will be the resident on her case today.

82
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,134
I will be preping her for surgery.

83
00:06:09,154 --> 00:06:11,075
And if you going into that hospital room today,

84
00:06:11,095 --> 00:06:13,411
You'll do so as her friends.

85
00:06:13,431 --> 00:06:15,391
Izzie needs her people around her.

86
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:16,760
She needs you tell her everything will be fine.

87
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,607
She needs you hold her hands.

88
00:06:18,627 --> 00:06:21,648
She needs you. Not more doctors. Understood?

89
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,434
Great. Let's get started.

90
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:32,183
As you know, you have stage iv metastatic melanoma.

91
00:06:32,203 --> 00:06:34,129
We have a lot of surgeries and a lot of procedures

92
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:36,111
lined up for you over the next few weeks.

93
00:06:36,131 --> 00:06:38,395
We've seen evidence of METS on your liver

94
00:06:38,415 --> 00:06:41,504
So one of those surgeries Dr. Bailey and I will resect them.

95
00:06:41,524 --> 00:06:44,094
We also lined up Dr. Parker from O.B. to

96
00:06:44,114 --> 00:06:45,965
harvest as many healthy eggs as she can

97
00:06:45,985 --> 00:06:48,012
before you undergo any radiation.

98
00:06:48,292 --> 00:06:49,647
Right. Babies.

99
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:51,392
You just leave me a word before if you wanna

100
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:54,522
But our priority today is to address the temporal lobe mets on your brain.

101
00:06:54,542 --> 00:06:55,702
I'm surprised we need to catch it soon.

102
00:06:55,742 --> 00:06:56,902
This kind of thing can cause headaches and seizures.

103
00:06:56,922 --> 00:06:58,561
and intense hallucinations.

104
00:06:58,581 --> 00:07:01,573
But hopefully delusion has cleared much since I can remove it all.

105
00:07:01,593 --> 00:07:02,849
Are you people done?

106
00:07:04,535 --> 00:07:07,581
Over the next four weeks, you're slated for three major surgeries.

107
00:07:07,601 --> 00:07:09,526
Seven out-patient procedures.

108
00:07:09,546 --> 00:07:11,220
That's just for the METS we've already found

109
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,079
And all likelihood we will find more

110
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,508
Which means we may have to cut into you more

111
00:07:15,528 --> 00:07:16,996
You may get used to the idea now.

112
00:07:17,265 --> 00:07:19,114
I'll be adiministering all your radiation

113
00:07:19,134 --> 00:07:20,993
chemotherapy and immunotherapy.

114
00:07:21,013 --> 00:07:22,663
The treatment will be agressive.

115
00:07:22,683 --> 00:07:24,921
It would be harsh. You should prepare yourself.

116
00:07:25,247 --> 00:07:26,897
I will be overseeing all your procedures,

117
00:07:26,917 --> 00:07:28,695
Including today's with Dr. Shepherd.

118
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:32,307
Which means every surgeon in this room

119
00:07:32,308 --> 00:07:33,654
now answers to me.

120
00:07:35,342 --> 00:07:36,980
Welcome to the counseling, folks.

121
00:07:39,752 --> 00:07:41,108
See you in the OR.

122
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:53,969
Seriously, don't just stand there staring at me.

123
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,186
Well, I admit it. I can be nervours.

124
00:07:55,206 --> 00:07:56,480
Get out of here.

125
00:07:56,992 --> 00:07:57,626
Go save lives.

126
00:07:57,646 --> 00:08:00,273
Yeah. We're on rounds. OK.

127
00:08:00,536 --> 00:08:01,476
See you later.

128
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:20,413
Karev, I just reviewed Izzie's most recent MRI.

129
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:21,787
Doesn't look the tumor's grown since her last cancer.

130
00:08:21,807 --> 00:08:23,956
That's good news.

131
00:08:23,976 --> 00:08:25,648
Do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to discuss with me

132
00:08:25,668 --> 00:08:28,104
before we brief Izzie.

133
00:08:28,124 --> 00:08:31,256
Just try keeping her frontal lobe inside her skull this time.

134
00:08:36,524 --> 00:08:38,256
Good morning, Izzie.

135
00:08:38,472 --> 00:08:40,663
You come?

136
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,237
No. I'm on this old lady. So

137
00:08:42,257 --> 00:08:45,105
Are you sure? This'll only take a minute.

138
00:08:45,105 --> 00:08:46,105
I gotta go. Really.

139
00:08:47,398 --> 00:08:48,657
Hi, Dr. Sloan.

140
00:08:48,677 --> 00:08:50,378
These are Aunt Joice's nephews.

141
00:08:50,378 --> 00:08:51,242
These're my brothers Toben and Luke

142
00:08:51,262 --> 00:08:53,379
They flew in early this morning.

143
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,606
Dr. Sloan is doing the surgery.

144
00:08:54,626 --> 00:08:56,966
I'm sorry. Your aunt is very sick.

145
00:08:56,986 --> 00:08:58,248
There's not much more we can do for her.

146
00:08:58,249 --> 00:09:00,072
Probably time to say goodbyes.

147
00:09:01,101 --> 00:09:03,535
you mean, like say our goodbyes now

148
00:09:03,555 --> 00:09:06,255
or some time in next 24 hours?

149
00:09:06,275 --> 00:09:08,147
I mean what kind of time frame are we talking about?

150
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:11,183
24 hours seems unlikely.

151
00:09:11,203 --> 00:09:12,386
You sure?

152
00:09:12,814 --> 00:09:15,995
Because I have a flight to catch in the morning.

153
00:09:16,015 --> 00:09:20,046
And if I wait past noon, I can't change it.

154
00:09:21,514 --> 00:09:23,977
I actually need to be on the plane tonight.

155
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:25,553
Board meeting tomorrow.

156
00:09:25,573 --> 00:09:28,900
So do you think she'll die before tomorrow?

157
00:09:32,411 --> 00:09:34,854
You really think Shepherd's a god for Steven's surgery today?

158
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,616
Did you have somebody else in mind?

159
00:09:36,636 --> 00:09:38,029
Shepherd wouldn't be my choice

160
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:38,958
Given his recent history.

161
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,354
But hey, it's not my brain that man's handling.

162
00:09:41,695 --> 00:09:43,522
- No. - Damn!

163
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,251
She's HLA type D3

164
00:09:45,437 --> 00:09:46,693
Have to hit her with the DTIC

165
00:09:46,713 --> 00:09:49,115
and high dose IO-2 instead.

166
00:09:49,135 --> 00:09:50,982
IO 2. That's pretty toxic.

167
00:09:51,002 --> 00:09:52,218
It's about as bad as I guess.

168
00:09:52,238 --> 00:09:53,749
You're gonna tell Izzie this right now?

169
00:09:54,315 --> 00:09:55,806
I am her oncologist

170
00:09:55,826 --> 00:09:57,836
Study show that giving patients bad news right before surgery

171
00:09:57,856 --> 00:10:01,232
can drastically increase their chances of complications on the table.

172
00:10:01,558 --> 00:10:03,428
Today or tomorrow, the news is the same.

173
00:10:03,448 --> 00:10:05,223
And right now, I have time.

174
00:10:05,243 --> 00:10:06,217
You coming?

175
00:10:07,008 --> 00:10:09,494
I believe Izzie is down in radiology now.

176
00:10:10,384 --> 00:10:12,349
Fine. We can wait an hour.

177
00:10:18,044 --> 00:10:19,620
Chief. You paged me?

178
00:10:19,754 --> 00:10:22,397
Oh, Karev. Yes, I did.

179
00:10:22,735 --> 00:10:26,392
I should know we're gonna be harvesting eggs

180
00:10:27,241 --> 00:10:28,599
from Stevens.

181
00:10:29,439 --> 00:10:32,524
Who I believe is someone you're having relation with.

182
00:10:32,544 --> 00:10:35,637
- Chief. - Frozen eggs have a better survival rate

183
00:10:35,657 --> 00:10:39,022
went they're fertilized.

184
00:10:39,985 --> 00:10:40,966
fertilized.

185
00:10:40,986 --> 00:10:43,682
I know this is a lot to digest.

186
00:10:43,702 --> 00:10:45,978
So take some time.

187
00:10:45,998 --> 00:10:47,172
Think about it.

188
00:10:47,831 --> 00:10:51,101
If you decide this is somebody might want to consider

189
00:10:51,121 --> 00:10:52,968
Just give me the cup.

190
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:55,355
Karev. You need to speak to Stevens.

191
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:56,355
Just give me the cup.

192
00:11:10,543 --> 00:11:11,712
She's doing OK?

193
00:11:12,516 --> 00:11:14,658
Yeah. Well, she said she is.

194
00:11:14,678 --> 00:11:15,791
Do you believe her?

195
00:11:15,811 --> 00:11:17,417
No. Not really.

196
00:11:17,735 --> 00:11:21,590
Oh. Heads up.

197
00:11:46,552 --> 00:11:47,300
What do you hear?

198
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,713
Motorcycle lost control.No helmet.

199
00:11:48,733 --> 00:11:50,364
No helmet. Massive head trauma.

200
00:11:50,384 --> 00:11:52,313
Lots of vital signs unmoved.

201
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,335
- Good to have you back, Shepherd. - Thanks.

202
00:12:25,132 --> 00:12:26,922
Come on.

203
00:12:30,803 --> 00:12:32,534
Hunt. You hear me?

204
00:12:33,665 --> 00:12:34,889
Owen.

205
00:12:53,734 --> 00:12:55,507
Swender has no vision.

206
00:12:55,527 --> 00:12:56,896
He grabbed his hands on your throat this morning.

207
00:12:56,897 --> 00:12:58,530
You pretending like nothing happened?

208
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,811
Just focus on Izzie.

209
00:12:59,831 --> 00:13:01,456
Hunt literally tried to kill you.

210
00:13:01,977 --> 00:13:03,647
He's barely back form Iraq.

211
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:05,423
It's obvious he has issues.

212
00:13:05,443 --> 00:13:07,370
That doesn't mean you have to stand by.

213
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:10,190
So like if he had a heart attack or stroke or lost a leg

214
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:11,670
Would, would you walk away?

215
00:13:12,182 --> 00:13:14,584
So how is it anymore acceptable that I walk away from this?

216
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:17,027
He's wounded. He's war wounds. Meredith.

217
00:13:17,215 --> 00:13:18,544
It's not cut and drive.

218
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,219
And it is not as bad as you think it is.

219
00:13:21,461 --> 00:13:22,035
Clear.

220
00:13:24,587 --> 00:13:25,529
This might be it.

221
00:13:25,853 --> 00:13:27,296
From your lips to God's ears.

222
00:13:27,316 --> 00:13:28,926
Charge to 360. Clear.

223
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:34,853
Oh, for the love of god.

224
00:13:34,873 --> 00:13:37,221
Hey, you know how many people are in this hospital right now

225
00:13:37,241 --> 00:13:39,690
Waiting, hoping that their loved one might actually live?

226
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:42,424
You're a bunch of vultures. but we're not.

227
00:13:42,444 --> 00:13:46,729
Aunt joyce was given one month to live three years ago.

228
00:13:46,749 --> 00:13:48,526
And we were crushed,

229
00:13:48,546 --> 00:13:51,904
And we held her hand at her bedside for weeks,

230
00:13:51,924 --> 00:13:53,899
And we said our tearful good-byes,

231
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:55,516
And then... well...

232
00:13:55,536 --> 00:13:57,751
She stabilized.

233
00:13:57,771 --> 00:14:00,255
She's been in and out of the hospital once a month.

234
00:14:00,275 --> 00:14:02,915
Each time, we jump on a plane, sit by her bed,

235
00:14:02,935 --> 00:14:04,583
Say our good-byes all over again,

236
00:14:04,603 --> 00:14:07,541
And each time, she winds up getting better.

237
00:14:07,561 --> 00:14:09,703
We want to be here when she goes.

238
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,042
We--we really do, but...

239
00:14:11,062 --> 00:14:14,277
It's a lot of flying around the country.

240
00:14:14,297 --> 00:14:16,630
She's ready. we're all ready.

241
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:17,836
It's time.

242
00:14:19,284 --> 00:14:21,619
And I've got a board meeting tomorrow.

243
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:24,887
Big one.

244
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:29,504
You know, they're doing tests

245
00:14:29,524 --> 00:14:32,217
That show altered brain anatomy in patients with p.t.s.d.

246
00:14:32,237 --> 00:14:33,552
They're actually getting close to understanding

247
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:35,589
The physical side of the psychological trauma.

248
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:37,467
It's amazing what you can see with an m.r.i.

249
00:14:37,487 --> 00:14:39,237
What did meredith tell you about last night?

250
00:14:39,257 --> 00:14:42,968
What did she say? post-traumatic stress is a real injury, owen.

251
00:14:42,988 --> 00:14:44,774
It can be healed.

252
00:14:44,794 --> 00:14:48,128
There are resources-- vet centers, therapy.

253
00:14:48,772 --> 00:14:50,835
You shouldn't try and handle this on your own.

254
00:14:51,206 --> 00:14:53,866
I came back in one piece. I have both arms, both legs.

255
00:14:53,886 --> 00:14:56,256
Lots of guys came back with real injuries.

256
00:14:56,276 --> 00:14:58,251
If the worst I have is a couple nightmares or--

257
00:14:58,271 --> 00:15:01,010
Or freezing for a moment-- is that what happened last night?

258
00:15:01,957 --> 00:15:03,603
You had a freezing moment?

259
00:15:04,542 --> 00:15:06,544
If you want, I can help.

260
00:15:06,564 --> 00:15:10,769
Oh, yeah? I'm not the one who needs help around here.

261
00:15:10,789 --> 00:15:12,482
I'm not the one who cut out half a woman's brain

262
00:15:12,502 --> 00:15:13,515
Then ran off to hide.

263
00:15:13,535 --> 00:15:15,759
I'm not the one who half this hospital is talking about

264
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:16,656
Behind their back.

265
00:15:16,676 --> 00:15:18,042
So maybe you should spend a little less time

266
00:15:18,062 --> 00:15:19,387
Worrying about me, and, you know,

267
00:15:19,407 --> 00:15:21,353
Just take a look in the mirror, all right?

268
00:15:26,989 --> 00:15:28,344
Karev.

269
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,556
Just checking in, see how your c--

270
00:15:32,404 --> 00:15:33,754
See how you'reoing.

271
00:15:33,774 --> 00:15:35,042
I'd be doing better if you weren't

272
00:15:35,062 --> 00:15:36,830
On the other side of the door listening.

273
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,826
Uh, right, right. sorry.

274
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,759
I said go away.

275
00:15:43,447 --> 00:15:46,729
You left the door unlocked. that's bold.

276
00:15:47,082 --> 00:15:48,496
The chief send you in here?

277
00:15:48,811 --> 00:15:52,499
Nope. I offered to come in, in case you needed to talk.

278
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:54,561
You think talking will help?

279
00:15:54,581 --> 00:15:56,145
You think a dixie cup full of my swimmers

280
00:15:56,165 --> 00:15:57,606
Will make everything okay?

281
00:15:57,626 --> 00:16:00,608
It's crap. this is crap.

282
00:16:02,193 --> 00:16:05,623
You just can't go messing with people's heads like that.

283
00:16:06,746 --> 00:16:08,985
I mean, even if she freezes the embryos,

284
00:16:09,005 --> 00:16:10,737
You think--you think we'll get a chance to use them?

285
00:16:10,757 --> 00:16:12,327
You think she'll still be here?

286
00:16:13,491 --> 00:16:15,125
You think she'll survive all this?

287
00:16:15,145 --> 00:16:16,028
Do you think...

288
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,070
I think...

289
00:16:21,101 --> 00:16:22,870
She t-told me--

290
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:25,411
She told me she was seeing a ghost, okay?

291
00:16:25,431 --> 00:16:27,881
And I'm so used to all the crazy chicks in my life

292
00:16:27,901 --> 00:16:29,295
That I didn't even...

293
00:16:33,605 --> 00:16:34,591
I'm a doctor.

294
00:16:34,821 --> 00:16:36,296
A doctor!

295
00:16:38,496 --> 00:16:40,143
And I didn't even think to...

296
00:16:42,903 --> 00:16:44,441
And now she's...

297
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:45,259
This is...

298
00:16:46,012 --> 00:16:47,648
This is wrong.

299
00:16:48,771 --> 00:16:51,341
This isn't how it's supposed to happen.

300
00:16:51,361 --> 00:16:52,346
I know.

301
00:16:52,366 --> 00:16:55,064
It's crap. I know.

302
00:16:55,256 --> 00:16:56,759
I hate this.

303
00:16:56,854 --> 00:16:57,587
I know.

304
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,307
This isn't...

305
00:17:04,104 --> 00:17:06,897
This isn't how we... how we were supp--

306
00:17:06,917 --> 00:17:08,795
This isn't how I wanted to do this.

307
00:17:08,815 --> 00:17:11,263
This isn't how izzie and I were supposed to make a baby.

308
00:17:29,995 --> 00:17:32,452
I haven't seen you all day.

309
00:17:33,687 --> 00:17:35,656
What if I hadn't woken up?

310
00:17:38,723 --> 00:17:40,652
I can't even remember what happened. it's gone.

311
00:17:40,672 --> 00:17:42,807
I have no memory, no--no way to...

312
00:17:46,184 --> 00:17:49,230
I would never hurt you, ever.

313
00:17:50,026 --> 00:17:51,157
But I did.

314
00:17:51,859 --> 00:17:53,121
My hands just...

315
00:17:53,596 --> 00:17:54,987
I mean, how could--

316
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:56,697
How could my own two hands be capable...

317
00:17:58,337 --> 00:18:02,129
-I can't do this. cristina -but you did wake up.

318
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:03,948
We need to stop seeing each other.

319
00:18:04,051 --> 00:18:05,704
We have to stop seeing each other. why?

320
00:18:05,724 --> 00:18:07,449
Cristina, I almost-- almost what?

321
00:18:09,231 --> 00:18:11,951
I told you, I know my limits.

322
00:18:12,837 --> 00:18:14,858
Let me decide what I can handle.

323
00:18:38,153 --> 00:18:39,840
Oh, good. stand right there.

324
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,908
Let me see. I never know how long to make these.

325
00:18:42,168 --> 00:18:44,563
I like the color. who's it for, karev? unh-un

326
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,065
Haven't seen much of him today.

327
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,100
He's working. they're all working.

328
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,971
I told them to go work. they're doctors.

329
00:18:51,991 --> 00:18:53,372
Their patients shouldn't suffer

330
00:18:53,392 --> 00:18:55,291
Just because I have things growing on my organs.

331
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:59,534
I have a colectomy this afternoon.

332
00:18:59,554 --> 00:19:03,830
If you were the resident assisting me,

333
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,434
And I were to say to you, "divide the cecum,"  What would you use?

334
00:19:05,454 --> 00:19:09,921
dr. bailey, I'm not assisting you,

335
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:11,707
And you're not gonna ask me to divide the cecum.

336
00:19:11,727 --> 00:19:13,149
But I'm not gonna let you get rusty.

337
00:19:13,169 --> 00:19:15,301
A year from now, you need to be able to do this stuff.

338
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,282
You need to be able to teach your residents how to do it.

339
00:19:17,302 --> 00:19:19,308
You really think I'm gonna be here a year from now?

340
00:19:19,328 --> 00:19:20,230
Yes, I do.

341
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:26,052
So... I have exposed the right lower quadrant,

342
00:19:26,072 --> 00:19:28,755
And you are dividing the cecum with...

343
00:19:29,382 --> 00:19:30,404
Forceps.

344
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:36,701
I lift free from the arachnoid.

345
00:19:39,608 --> 00:19:40,738
Tacking sutures.

346
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:46,028
Patties.

347
00:19:47,624 --> 00:19:48,799
Suction.

348
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:10,543
lets training a lot

349
00:20:15,941 --> 00:20:18,362
Here's your cup, all filled up.

350
00:20:20,955 --> 00:20:22,557
I'm eating here, karev.

351
00:20:22,577 --> 00:20:24,174
It's fine. I washed my hands.

352
00:20:24,174 --> 00:20:25,771
did you talk to izzie about this yet?

353
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,800
Considering you two are basically

354
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,318
Conceiving a child together today,

355
00:20:29,338 --> 00:20:31,271
Don't you think you should talk with her about this?

356
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:34,144
Look, you said she needed my... contribution.

357
00:20:34,164 --> 00:20:36,062
Here's my contribution. whatever.

358
00:20:49,987 --> 00:20:51,315
Hey, how's izzie?

359
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:52,513
I don't know.

360
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,483
-How's izzie? -why?

361
00:20:57,503 --> 00:20:59,031
Have you been to see her?

362
00:20:59,031 --> 00:21:00,559
no, I've been working with swender all day.

363
00:21:07,222 --> 00:21:08,012
What?

364
00:21:08,032 --> 00:21:10,301
-Have you been to see izzie? -no. haven't you?

365
00:21:21,741 --> 00:21:23,748
You finished that thing in one day?

366
00:21:23,768 --> 00:21:25,064
Had some free time.

367
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:26,775
I've had a lot of free time.

368
00:21:28,133 --> 00:21:29,489
Nobody came up to visit?

369
00:21:30,196 --> 00:21:31,085
It's okay.

370
00:21:31,411 --> 00:21:32,902
If I were them,

371
00:21:32,922 --> 00:21:35,038
I wouldn't want to step foot in this room either.

372
00:21:35,787 --> 00:21:37,797
You don't have to keep checking up on me, you know?

373
00:21:37,817 --> 00:21:39,097
I do have to.

374
00:21:39,117 --> 00:21:42,064
I have to start you on this before your surgery.

375
00:21:42,084 --> 00:21:44,028
Right. surgery.

376
00:21:44,048 --> 00:21:47,536
Well, and I wanted to tell you

377
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:48,974
How my surgery went this afternoon.

378
00:21:48,994 --> 00:21:49,948
Colon guy.

379
00:21:49,968 --> 00:21:52,838
Yeah. now the colectomy went great.

380
00:21:52,858 --> 00:21:56,638
But I was in there, and I see a mass.

381
00:21:56,658 --> 00:21:58,096
You're kidding. was it a big mass?

382
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:00,218
It was big enough, about the size of a fist.

383
00:22:00,238 --> 00:22:03,151
This is going to burn a little at first,

384
00:22:03,171 --> 00:22:04,716
But, uh, just for a few seconds.

385
00:22:04,736 --> 00:22:09,119
So we had to mobilize the s.m.a.

386
00:22:09,139 --> 00:22:13,555
Before we could resect the thing and reconnect the bowel.

387
00:22:16,392 --> 00:22:18,689
I wished izzie stevens would die.

388
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,518
I wished her dead every day of every week

389
00:22:22,538 --> 00:22:23,584
For I don't even know how long.

390
00:22:23,604 --> 00:22:26,177
I woke up every morning wishing izzie stevens would die.

391
00:22:26,197 --> 00:22:27,213
And now...

392
00:22:31,337 --> 00:22:33,347
What kind of person wishes someone would die?

393
00:22:33,367 --> 00:22:36,409
What kind of doctor wishes-- knowing how things happen,

394
00:22:39,538 --> 00:22:43,004
What kind... what kind of doctor wishes...

395
00:22:43,638 --> 00:22:48,029
Are you in here right now praying for izzie to die?

396
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:49,703
No.

397
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:51,955
I'm praying for her to live.

398
00:22:57,095 --> 00:22:58,459
Clear.

399
00:22:58,524 --> 00:23:00,343
You know what? why don't you all wait outside?

400
00:23:00,363 --> 00:23:02,906
-Will you let us know if she-- yeah, yeah, I'll let you know.

401
00:23:05,011 --> 00:23:06,366
Bastards.

402
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:08,617
Push 1 epi. charge to 360. clear.

403
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:12,410
come on, joyce, you old bag.

404
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,840
Don't give 'em the satisfaction.

405
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,721
Charge again. clear.

406
00:23:25,898 --> 00:23:27,332
I'm dr. karev.

407
00:23:27,352 --> 00:23:28,913
You're a fighter, you know that?

408
00:23:28,933 --> 00:23:30,112
You worked hard today.

409
00:23:30,562 --> 00:23:32,060
She needs some rest.

410
00:23:32,865 --> 00:23:36,743
Um, see the family, make sure they don't come back in here.

411
00:23:36,763 --> 00:23:38,519
Give her a break from all the love.

412
00:23:38,539 --> 00:23:39,219
No.

413
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,031
They're impatient.

414
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:44,887
It's been a long time.

415
00:23:49,107 --> 00:23:51,724
But they always come.

416
00:23:52,394 --> 00:23:53,937
They're my people.

417
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:57,080
People keep you going.

418
00:23:59,143 --> 00:24:02,705
People are better than no people.

419
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:17,299
Uh, it's not a good time. he's still scrubbing in.

420
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:19,392
I know. it's just, uh, he should wear this.

421
00:24:19,412 --> 00:24:21,886
It's his ferry boat scrub cap. he loves ferry boats.

422
00:24:29,349 --> 00:24:30,561
Meredith.

423
00:24:31,134 --> 00:24:33,333
What are you doing? you're gonna have to rescrub.

424
00:24:35,751 --> 00:24:37,030
I'm not ready.

425
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,384
Yes, you are.

426
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:40,858
I need to know that at least I have you.

427
00:24:40,878 --> 00:24:42,435
No matter what happens in there, I need to know.

428
00:24:42,455 --> 00:24:45,192
-I need you to say yes. I need to know. -I can't say yes,

429
00:24:45,212 --> 00:24:47,150
Not if agreeing to be with you forever

430
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:48,831
Will make it okay if izzie dies.

431
00:24:48,851 --> 00:24:53,543
I can't say yes. I love you, and you can do this.

432
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:56,427
You can do this. I know you can.

433
00:25:10,997 --> 00:25:12,069
Iz...

434
00:25:39,922 --> 00:25:41,752
I'll see you soon, dr. stevens.

435
00:25:43,397 --> 00:25:44,428
I hope so.

436
00:25:44,565 --> 00:25:45,711
Know so.

437
00:25:49,137 --> 00:25:51,141
Dr. bailey, if something goes wrong--

438
00:25:51,161 --> 00:25:51,906
It won't.

439
00:25:54,294 --> 00:25:55,511
The scarf...

440
00:25:56,637 --> 00:25:57,909
I made it for you.

441
00:26:06,223 --> 00:26:08,355
Beautiful night to save lives.

442
00:26:12,395 --> 00:26:13,946
Let's get started.

443
00:26:25,708 --> 00:26:28,245
Okay, so I get why I haven't been camped out

444
00:26:28,265 --> 00:26:29,680
At izzie's bedside holding her hand today,

445
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,834
But-- I'm not talking about this.

446
00:26:30,854 --> 00:26:31,943
Why not?

447
00:26:31,963 --> 00:26:35,373
Maybe it's the fact that I asked izzie a hundred times

448
00:26:36,217 --> 00:26:37,665
What was wrong,

449
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:39,771
And she just ignored me.

450
00:26:39,791 --> 00:26:42,724
And then there's the fact that when she actually needed help,

451
00:26:42,744 --> 00:26:43,484
She turn--

452
00:26:43,504 --> 00:26:46,198
She trusted cristina, of all people.

453
00:26:46,218 --> 00:26:49,323
And then there's the fact that she's your best friend

454
00:26:49,343 --> 00:26:50,176
And she might die on you.

455
00:26:51,811 --> 00:26:53,361
There's also that.

456
00:27:02,173 --> 00:27:02,927
Come on.

457
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,402
We are going to go wait for izzie.

458
00:27:05,422 --> 00:27:05,900
Come on.

459
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,901
George, you were my husband and you slept with her.

460
00:27:08,986 --> 00:27:11,135
You are the reason that I wished her dead.

461
00:27:11,155 --> 00:27:11,749
You owe me this.

462
00:27:12,925 --> 00:27:15,130
Look, you can lie to yourself all you want,

463
00:27:15,304 --> 00:27:16,707
But I know you.

464
00:27:16,853 --> 00:27:18,232
I loved you once.

465
00:27:18,983 --> 00:27:21,283
And I know that you care if she lives or dies.

466
00:27:26,535 --> 00:27:28,129
Surgery started.

467
00:27:33,496 --> 00:27:35,404
-Hey, have they started the surgery?-Yeah.

468
00:27:35,424 --> 00:27:40,248
dr. grey, we were wondering,

469
00:27:40,268 --> 00:27:42,052
Did dr. stevens' surgery start yet or--

470
00:27:42,072 --> 00:27:44,374
Keep it moving. no loitering in the o.r. hallway.

471
00:27:44,394 --> 00:27:46,125
-That's the rule. -if they want to stay, let 'em stay.

472
00:27:47,944 --> 00:27:50,196
People are better than no people.

473
00:27:53,616 --> 00:27:55,775
Okay, clamp.

474
00:27:56,429 --> 00:27:58,775
All right, I'm ready to, uh--no.

475
00:28:01,934 --> 00:28:02,773
Yes, okay.

476
00:28:03,009 --> 00:28:05,352
I'm ready to buzz the superficial temporal artery.

477
00:28:06,362 --> 00:28:09,257
-Tenting sutures. -there's no rush. take your time.

478
00:28:09,277 --> 00:28:11,852
-Everyone here is on your side. a-re you sure that's gonna hold,

479
00:28:11,872 --> 00:28:13,994
What, with all that friable scar tissue? dr. swender.

480
00:28:14,813 --> 00:28:17,867
Uh, actually I saw dr. shepherd

481
00:28:17,887 --> 00:28:20,154
Do three different craniotomies last month,

482
00:28:20,174 --> 00:28:23,865
Each with easily double the amount of friable tissue.

483
00:28:23,885 --> 00:28:25,854
They held just fine.

484
00:28:26,283 --> 00:28:29,007
Next tenting suture, please.

485
00:28:31,134 --> 00:28:32,210
Clear.

486
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:36,479
push another epi. charge again.

487
00:28:36,499 --> 00:28:38,298
Come on, mrs. wallington. clear.

488
00:28:42,945 --> 00:28:44,195
Uh, i-i'm so sorry.

489
00:28:44,215 --> 00:28:46,139
She's not responding. we've done everything we can.

490
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:47,707
So... she's gone.

491
00:28:49,137 --> 00:28:51,852
Thank you. you did a wonderful job.

492
00:28:57,807 --> 00:28:59,813
Are you kidding me?

493
00:28:59,833 --> 00:29:01,499
Oh, god. this is never gonna end.

494
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:04,607
No, no, she--she's gone.

495
00:29:04,691 --> 00:29:06,466
She's really gone. it's really gone.

496
00:29:06,486 --> 00:29:09,226
It's--it's, um, it's her pacemaker. it's still firing,

497
00:29:09,246 --> 00:29:10,807
So it makes it seem like there's a heartbeat,

498
00:29:10,827 --> 00:29:12,209
But she's gone.

499
00:29:12,229 --> 00:29:13,856
Just... with a heartbeat.

500
00:29:13,876 --> 00:29:17,066
Are you sure she's dead, young lady?

501
00:29:17,086 --> 00:29:20,716
I--i'm an intern. I'm not authorized to call time of death

502
00:29:20,736 --> 00:29:21,914
In a situation like this.

503
00:29:21,934 --> 00:29:23,539
So i--i'm gonna get my superior.

504
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:27,502
Excuse me. I'll-- I'll be right back. excuse me.

505
00:29:34,609 --> 00:29:37,089
-I'm worried about you. o-h, meredith--

506
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:39,122
-Choking. you know what? -stop.

507
00:29:39,473 --> 00:29:41,728
-It's unacceptable. -will you back off?

508
00:29:42,893 --> 00:29:44,106
Hands around the neck.

509
00:29:44,126 --> 00:29:45,592
Ring thrown in your face.

510
00:29:53,665 --> 00:29:56,109
This will shut the pacemaker down.

511
00:29:59,885 --> 00:30:01,896
Time of death--2240.

512
00:30:03,396 --> 00:30:04,927
There you go. she's officially dead.

513
00:30:04,947 --> 00:30:07,738
You can catch your plane and get to your board meeting.

514
00:30:07,758 --> 00:30:08,903
You can--you can leave.

515
00:30:28,099 --> 00:30:29,201
Actually...

516
00:30:31,124 --> 00:30:33,091
Could we stay a little while longer?

517
00:31:05,752 --> 00:31:07,257
What are you all doing out here?

518
00:31:10,678 --> 00:31:12,314
Waiting for izzie, sir.

519
00:31:12,334 --> 00:31:13,699
We're waiting.

520
00:31:19,195 --> 00:31:20,262
You're scared.

521
00:31:26,078 --> 00:31:27,154
I'm scared, too.

522
00:31:38,164 --> 00:31:38,911
Damn it.

523
00:31:40,133 --> 00:31:41,812
Some of the sylvian vessels

524
00:31:41,832 --> 00:31:43,345
Have wrapped around the tumor capsule.

525
00:31:43,365 --> 00:31:45,154
Penfield 4, please.

526
00:31:45,174 --> 00:31:47,142
Really? instead of the arachnoid knife?

527
00:31:47,162 --> 00:31:49,680
Yes, instead of the arachnoid knife,

528
00:31:50,404 --> 00:31:51,888
Because the penfield 4 will let me

529
00:31:51,908 --> 00:31:53,904
Slide the arteries around the met.

530
00:31:53,924 --> 00:31:55,825
I need to dissect it free

531
00:31:55,845 --> 00:31:57,191
So that I can debulk the tumors,

532
00:31:57,211 --> 00:31:58,822
Avoiding unnecessary trauma to my patient.

533
00:31:58,842 --> 00:32:01,199
So yes, penfield 4, please.

534
00:32:08,325 --> 00:32:10,526
Were her vitals stable the entire time?

535
00:32:10,546 --> 00:32:12,021
Were there any spikes in her intracranial pressure?

536
00:32:12,041 --> 00:32:12,904
Is there any residual tumor?

537
00:32:12,924 --> 00:32:15,629
Shepherd was able to resect all of the tumor.

538
00:32:15,649 --> 00:32:18,421
She'll be in the pacu for about an hour.

539
00:32:18,982 --> 00:32:20,203
She's fine.

540
00:32:23,245 --> 00:32:27,426
Your friend is just fine, no thanks to any of you.

541
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:30,373
Tomorrow, do better.

542
00:32:37,357 --> 00:32:38,808
The surgery went well today.

543
00:32:39,972 --> 00:32:41,362
Shouldn't you and meredith

544
00:32:41,382 --> 00:32:42,910
Be out celebrating or something?

545
00:32:43,713 --> 00:32:45,211
She turned me down, twice.

546
00:32:46,472 --> 00:32:47,777
She says she understands,

547
00:32:47,797 --> 00:32:49,636
She forgives me for what happened in the woods,

548
00:32:49,656 --> 00:32:50,139
But...

549
00:32:52,336 --> 00:32:54,401
So you showed her your dark side?

550
00:32:54,726 --> 00:32:56,453
Meredith never struck me as a woman

551
00:32:56,473 --> 00:32:57,705
Who was afraid of the dark.

552
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:58,449
I don't know.

553
00:33:01,122 --> 00:33:03,128
Do you know it was meredith's idea

554
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:05,960
To ask izzie if she wanted to harvest her eggs,

555
00:33:07,512 --> 00:33:09,993
So izzie could have a chance at the future she wanted?

556
00:33:10,367 --> 00:33:11,491
The future, derek.

557
00:33:12,385 --> 00:33:14,302
She was confident you'd succeed today.

558
00:33:15,948 --> 00:33:18,197
Meredith believes in you.

559
00:33:37,255 --> 00:33:38,381
I'm here, iz.

560
00:33:41,005 --> 00:33:42,136
I'm right here.

561
00:33:56,864 --> 00:33:58,410
Izzie's surgery went well.

562
00:33:58,487 --> 00:33:59,518
Good. that's good.

563
00:34:02,469 --> 00:34:03,875
I wish things were...

564
00:34:05,664 --> 00:34:06,836
That they could be...

565
00:34:07,681 --> 00:34:08,565
That we could be...

566
00:34:09,553 --> 00:34:10,630
Me, too.

567
00:34:21,028 --> 00:34:22,989
Can i--can I hold you?

568
00:36:20,214 --> 00:36:22,845
Wait. uh, wait. no. y-you can't take that one.

569
00:36:22,865 --> 00:36:24,911
-Why not?  - I said don't take it.

570
00:36:25,661 --> 00:36:28,755
I will take the elevator I want to take.

571
00:36:51,641 --> 00:36:52,755
Well, go on.

572
00:37:01,198 --> 00:37:03,959
Hey. come on in.

573
00:37:08,787 --> 00:37:11,654
This is the c.t. for katie bryce--

574
00:37:12,024 --> 00:37:13,420
16-year-old female,

575
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,051
Subarachnoid aneurysm.

576
00:37:15,071 --> 00:37:17,412
From a fall during rhythmic gymnastics. I remember.

577
00:37:17,432 --> 00:37:19,324
It was the first surgery we ever scrubbed in together on,

578
00:37:19,344 --> 00:37:20,638
Our first save.

579
00:37:22,094 --> 00:37:25,611
Right here is a cerebral cyst. tough save, but we did it.

580
00:37:25,915 --> 00:37:28,865
I kissed you in the stairwell after the surgery.

581
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:30,783
And this right here is where dr. bailey

582
00:37:30,803 --> 00:37:32,684
Kicked you out of the surgery because she caught us

583
00:37:32,704 --> 00:37:34,629
In your driveway in my car.

584
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,747
And right here--this is a 7-hour craniotomy,

585
00:37:38,767 --> 00:37:40,920
And you held the clamp the entire time, never flinched.

586
00:37:41,452 --> 00:37:43,891
That's when I knew you were gonna be an incredible surgeon.

587
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,764
And beth monroe,

588
00:37:47,327 --> 00:37:49,672
Who made our clinical trial a success by surviving.

589
00:37:50,515 --> 00:37:52,579
You talked me into putting her under.

590
00:37:54,172 --> 00:37:55,718
That's when I knew I needed you.

591
00:37:58,354 --> 00:37:59,567
And this is today.

592
00:38:00,139 --> 00:38:02,627
Post-op head c.t. of izzie stevens.

593
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:05,790
You see that?

594
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,623
Tumor free...

595
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:12,154
Because of you.

596
00:38:13,329 --> 00:38:14,779
You got me into the o.r.

597
00:38:15,675 --> 00:38:18,957
If there's a crisis, you don't freeze.

598
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,496
You move forward.

599
00:38:21,342 --> 00:38:23,029
You get the rest of us to move forward,

600
00:38:23,832 --> 00:38:27,154
Because you've seen worse, you've survived worse.

601
00:38:27,904 --> 00:38:30,862
And you know we'll survive, too.

602
00:38:32,598 --> 00:38:35,456
You say you're all... dark and twisty,

603
00:38:36,388 --> 00:38:38,035
But that's not a flaw.

604
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:40,000
It's a strength.

605
00:38:41,216 --> 00:38:43,187
It makes you who you are.

606
00:38:46,049 --> 00:38:47,967
I'm not gonna get down on one knee.

607
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:50,967
I'm not gonna ask a question.

608
00:38:53,405 --> 00:38:54,955
I love you, meredith grey.

609
00:38:57,305 --> 00:39:00,627
And I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

610
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:06,905
And I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

611
00:39:30,562 --> 00:39:31,688
I don't think...

612
00:39:35,019 --> 00:39:37,315
I can't handle it after all.

613
00:39:40,784 --> 00:39:42,705
What? what do you mean?

614
00:39:43,782 --> 00:39:45,284
I'm sorry.

615
00:39:46,971 --> 00:39:50,063
I'm so, so sorry.

616
00:39:51,895 --> 00:39:53,869
But I'm lying here in your arms...

617
00:39:56,391 --> 00:39:58,880
And I'm afraid to fall asleep.

618
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,754
Doesn't matter how tough we are...

619
00:40:09,054 --> 00:40:11,346
I... I wanted to apologize for earlier.

620
00:40:11,972 --> 00:40:15,109
What I said was... it was out of line.

621
00:40:15,578 --> 00:40:16,750
It's already forgotten.

622
00:40:17,642 --> 00:40:20,221
Thank you for doing this.

623
00:40:27,427 --> 00:40:29,438
Trauma always leaves a scar.

624
00:40:42,261 --> 00:40:43,479
I'm engaged.

625
00:40:45,355 --> 00:40:46,997
I broke up with owen.

626
00:40:56,843 --> 00:40:58,158
It follows us home...

627
00:41:02,656 --> 00:41:04,246
It changes our liv...

628
00:41:07,857 --> 00:41:10,060
I snooched into a cup for you today.

629
00:41:13,527 --> 00:41:13,996
Um... thank you?

630
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,441
Trauma messes everybody up.

631
00:41:16,999 --> 00:41:18,732
But maybe that's the point.

632
00:41:19,533 --> 00:41:22,107
All the pain and the fear and the crap...

633
00:41:22,859 --> 00:41:24,420
Maybe going through all of that

634
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,229
Is what keeps us moving forward.

635
00:41:26,842 --> 00:41:28,197
It's what pushes us.

636
00:41:29,136 --> 00:41:30,823
Maybe we have to get a little messed up

637
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:33,357
Before we can step up

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
