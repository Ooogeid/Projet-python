1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:03,360
Previously on "Grey's Anatomy".

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,440
You're not attracted to me.

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:07,200
You think you are,but you're not.

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,920
You are nowhere near hard-core
enough to commit to cardio.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,880
Why isn't this easier?

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:12,980
I don't know.

7
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,000
Well,I want my best friend back.

8
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,360
You deserve the jo I should've
given it to you in t first place.

9
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,350
Things are gonna be
different from here on in.

10
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,700
Your love lives,your hopes and dreams,

11
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:27,520
the little joys and tragedies that make you
who you are have no place in my hospital.

12
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,360
This is our son.

13
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,420
He's beautiful.

14
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:41,100
we got into medicine because
we want to save lives.

15
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,860
We go into medicine
because we want to do good.

16
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,480
We go into medicine for the rush,

17
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,810
for the high,

18
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,360
for the ride.

19
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:53,680
You're not dancing.

20
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:54,260
I'm too tense to dance.

21
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,870
Which is why we're dancing.

22
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,910
My problem is,I'm sleeping
with a man who's dating.

23
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,800
And I don't care if he dates sydney.

24
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:04,310
It's the woman he dates after
sydney,that's my problem.

25
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,570
And if I had any sense at all,I
would break up with the breakup sex.

26
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,760
There would be no more breakup sexing.

27
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,120
-If I had any sense.
-shut up!

28
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,230
Dance it out.

29
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:19,680
But what we remember at the
end of most days are the losses.

30
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,800
What we lay awake 
at night replaying is.

31
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:29,040
the pain we caused or failed to cure,the
lives we ruined or failed to save.

32
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,980
You know,I'm gonna tell him.

33
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,830
I don't want him seeing other people.

34
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,540
Good. Fine. Whatever.

35
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,500
I'm gonna tell him,and
I feel good about it.

36
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,470
Dancing makes you brave.

37
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:48,020
So the experience of practicing
medicine rarely resembles the goal.

38
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:54,980
The experience,too often,is
ass-backwards and upside down.

39
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,350
I am so sick of meredith and cristina and
their stupid love affair with each other

40
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,360
that they have to rub
in everyone's faces.

41
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:06,370
It's. stupid dancing.
Friggin' bobbsey twins.

42
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,390
Stupid.

43
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:08,810
you're ranting.

44
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,510
It's kinda early in
the morning for ranting.

45
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,510
We're supposed to be the happy
ones. We should be dancing,george.

46
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,730
Why aren't we dancing?

47
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,340
You want to dance?

48
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,470
Whatever.

49
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,800
I'm gonna go in early.

50
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,580
I'm gonna get on hard-core erica hahn
cardio,and I'm gonna kick ass at it.

51
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,770
And when I kick ass at cardio,it's
gonna piss cristina off,

52
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,090
but it won't matter,because
I'll be a kick-ass cardio god.

53
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,460
I'm justaying,you're never here.

54
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,550
J. hold on,hold on.

55
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,720
I mess up the rotation schedule,the
residents are gonna dog me all week.

56
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,280
Okay.

57
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,880
You're never here.

58
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,540
I'm here in the mornings.

59
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,950
I'm here at night.

60
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,030
You're here between
midnight and 6:00 A. M.

61
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,890
I'm chief resident now.

62
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,430
and I'm loading the dishwasher!

63
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,360
hi.

64
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:19,970
You volunteered to
stay home with t-u-c-K.

65
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,540
Who else was gonna
take care of t-u-c-k?

66
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,670
I'm late for work.

67
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,900
Okay. Hey,honey.

68
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,700
We need to talk.

69
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,280
Okay.

70
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:34,340
Uh,take the baby by your
mom,and meet me for lunch,okay?

71
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,130
We'll talk then.

72
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,780
Well,why can't we talk here?

73
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,050
'Cause I'm only here between the
hours of midnight and 6:00 A.M.

74
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,400
Now come on. Now just
meet me for lunch,tucker.

75
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,200
Come on now.

76
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,890
-Lunch.
-Yes,lunch.

77
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,220
thatcher's not my problem.

78
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,980
-He can get drunk all he wants. I don't care.
-Right.

79
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,930
I don't care about lexie,either.

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,220
She's a big girl. She
can take care of herself.

81
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,460
You talk about them an awful
lot for someone who doesn't care.

82
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:12,740
You care because you're you.

83
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,710
Yore gonna make me late
for my meeting with sloan.

84
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,630
Well,okay then,go.

85
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,150
What?

86
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,630
Nothing. I'M.

87
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,680
gonna be late.

88
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:41,600
I'm late for sloan's meeting.

89
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,540
Yeah,so am I.

90
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,910
Also,I'm not speaking to you.

91
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,780
I'm still not speaking to you.

92
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,910
You don't have to speak.

93
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,970
Late for sloan.

94
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,200
okay,ladies and gentlemen,this
is nick hanscomb.

95
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,350
Hi.

96
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,490
Nick was lucky enough to have me remove
a large carotid body tumor from his neck.

97
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:18,990
The fact that I was able to get clean
boundaries is pretty darn impressive,even for me.

98
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,850
-Congratulations.
-Don't interrupt.

99
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:24,500
Now despite the fact that it
was a wildly successful surgery,

100
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,270
we had to dissect out deep
lymph nodes in his neck.

101
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:32,610
There is now only a delicate flap of skin
between his carotid artery and the outside world.

102
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:35,710
That said,what am I worried about?

103
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,540
I would think given the
friability of the skin,

104
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,850
that there's a great possibility
that the,um,the artery could blow?

105
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:42,990
Right.

106
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,000
oh,don't worry. I've.
I've heard this before.

107
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,300
If that happens,whoever's in the room,

108
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,150
I don't care if it's a
doctor,a nurse,an orderly,

109
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:55,100
your job is to stop the bleeding
then page me,in that order.

110
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,500
Are we clear? Any questions?

111
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,110
They look scared.

112
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,180
They're medical professionals,nick.

113
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,080
A healthy level of fear is encouraged.

114
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,740
Okay,then.

115
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:09,850
Uh,if I do die,it will have
been lovely meeting you all.

116
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,840
See?

117
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,960
The patient is confident.
You should be confident.

118
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,780
That's it.

119
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,560
what do we got?

120
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:22,010
Jacob nolston,47,status post a
double bypass surgery two weeks ago,

121
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,200
now presents febrile with pain and
tenderness in his surgical incisions.

122
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,530
We got a 10-car pileup on the
freeway. You mind taking him from here?

123
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:28,170
Oh,you got it.

124
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,600
okay,I need a gurney for the transfer.

125
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,960
I'll page hahn.

126
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,710
Sounds like we all agree. Get
him inside and flip for it.

127
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:34,920
You're in good hands,Mr. Nolston.

128
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:35,660
Thank you,gentlemen.

129
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,550
on three. One,two,three.

130
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:40,100
When are you gonna realize
you're in over your head?

131
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,240
when are you gonna realize that
you don't own the cardio department?

132
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,650
He's my patient. I got here first. Dibs.

133
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:44,600
hey,you guys.

134
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,920
You can't call dibs on a human being.

135
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:46,720
You guys,I think we should move.

136
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,710
-Let go of the gurney.
-You let go.

137
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,200
Move!

143
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,770

Get some gurneys out here!

ray.

145
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,620
Ray,can you hear me?

146
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,450
Stan?

147
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,710
stan?

148
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,640
Oh,my god.

149
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,100
Stan,open your eyes,man.

150
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,460
oh,man. Don't scare me like that.

151
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,550
Let's get you guys outta there.

152
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,970
No,stop. Stop. Don't touch anything.

153
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:50,480
Don't touch anything until fire stabilizes
the rig. These doors aren't gonna budge.

154
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,190
Uh,torres,I need your help here!

155
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,110
Get the driver.

156
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,290
Okay,on my way.

157
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:57,670
All right,listen. Just page somebody
to help you and keep them talking.

158
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,060
You got this?

159
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,850
Yeah.

160
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:06,200
Don't leave. Don'T.

161
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,550
Okay.

162
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,660
Somebody page the chief.

163
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,130
hey,you okay?

164
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:19,230
No,but I'm not as bad off as this guy.

165
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,730
He started coding
after we picked him up.

166
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,960
M-mary had some kind of seizure.

167
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,470
Mary?

168
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,360
Mary,come on,irl. Wake up.

169
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,260
I need some help here.

170
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,180
There's no pulse.
We'll call the coroner.

171
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:30,990
Let me check your injuries.

172
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,740
-No. Is she dead?
-***

173
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,330
No,but she looks postictal.

174
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:38,210
She's also got a bad elbow
dislocation and a weak pulse.

175
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,070
She was driving,she was talking to me.

176
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:43,160
She just started convulsing,and
then we slammed into that other rig.

177
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,620
All right. You think you can move?

178
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,520
Yeah.

179
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,080
hey,now you know I need to
stabilize you. You know the drill.

180
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,100
My c-spine's clear. I can. I can walk.

181
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,790
Well,come on.

182
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,240
Where are you injured?

183
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,850
My gut. Upper abdomen.

184
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,560
listen,I know this is gonna sound weird,

185
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:02,590
but do you think you
could get me a guy doctor?

186
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,250
how am I doing?

187
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,100
Strong and stable.

188
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,930
Strong and stable.

189
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,120
two words that have never
been used to describe me,ever.

190
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,480
You're a pretty girl.

191
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,880
I hope you don't think
that's rude. I'm just.

192
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,480
I haven't been allowed to notice
that kind of thing for a while and.

193
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,910
now I'm allowed.

194
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,820
You're allowed to notice prettiness?

195
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:37,260
Well,I'm allowed to notice,uh,other
women,women other than my girlfriend.

196
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,630
My now,uh,ex-girlfriend.

197
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,990
Oh,I'm sorry.

198
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,160
yeah,giant neck tumors
weren't her thing.

199
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,630
She left you because of the tumor?

200
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,700
Of course not. No.

201
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:51,730
She left me because,uh,I didn't
make her laugh anymore,and,uh,

202
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,680
she had just lost that lovin' feeling.

203
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:58,170
She left you because of the tumor.

204
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,250
-That sucks.
-Yep.

205
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,490
Y-you seeing anyone?

206
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,790
I'm j. I'm just making conversation.

207
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,000
My. my artery's exposed,you
know,which kind of limits my game.

208
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,220
Okay,uh.

209
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:14,310
yes. Well,kind of,I am.

210
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,100
Nice guy?

211
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,230
Yeah,he is.

212
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:22,290
Well,he's kind of,um,he's kind
of a nice guy disguised as a jerk.

213
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:24,130
Oh,yeah,I-I know that type. My.

214
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,830
my girlfriend was A.

215
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:29,690
nice girl disguised
as a vapid narcissist.

216
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:34,020
But then it turnedut she really
was just a vapid narcissist.

217
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,630
-Ouch.
-Yeah.

218
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,610
So you really like this guy?

219
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:43,660
Even though he doesn't have a
super cool exposed carotid artery?

220
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:47,790
yeah,I do.

221
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,020
what's going on in the pit? You
just wiped the surgical board.

222
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,850
Oh,uh,a couple of ambulances
crashed into each other,

223
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:58,840
so I'm canceling all electives to free
up the O.R.S for emergent surgeries.

224
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:00,230
Are we friends yet?

225
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:00,970
I'm sorry?

226
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,750
Friends. Are we friends?

227
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,290
I-I know I just learned
your name and all,rose,but I.

228
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,280
I'd like to think I
could call you a friend.

229
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,360
Why?

230
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,590
Because if i'm your friend,I could tell
you about the licorice stuck in your teeth.

231
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:16,920
Whereas a mere acquaintance,I'd smile
politely and pretend it wasn't there.

232
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,550
-thank you.
-yeah.

233
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,250
-jacob.
-dad.

234
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:23,340
hey,guys.

235
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,770
you okay?

236
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,230
what happened to your leg?

237
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,860
There was a.

238
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:31,500
a little accident,but,uh,I'mkay.
It doesn't hurt.

239
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,010
Well,what kind of an accident?

240
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:36,300
-Um,the ambulances crashed.
-The ambulances crashed?

241
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,390
Sandra,tell your mother not to panic.

242
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,470
Stop panicking,mom.

243
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,830
Is his heart okay?

244
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,780
What's your name?

245
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,380
Lucy.

246
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,010
Lucy. I'm izzie.

247
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:49,610
Your dad's heart is hurt,but we're gonna
work really hard to make it better,okay?

248
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,450
I was paged.

249
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:52,900
-Oh,I.
-Dr. Yang?

250
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,720
Jacob nolston,two weeks
post-op from a cabg.

251
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,310
My initial exam suggests
a sternal infection.

252
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:57,990
Our initial exam.

253
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:02,260
And he also sustained injuries to his
leg from an accident outside the E.R.

254
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,530
Okay,stevens,when you
can tear yourself away,

255
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,150
page torres about the
shrapnel in this man's leg.

256
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:11,640
And you can work with her
today. I only need one.

257
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,600
no.

258
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,860
You have to let me examine you.

259
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:18,610
I can wait. I. I'll wait for a guy.

260
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:21,390
Uh,y-you're shy.
Okay,I-I get that.

261
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,080
This is no time for shy.

262
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,610
Now my hands may be smaller than a man's,but
my brain is much larger,I assure you.

263
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,200
Now you're just going to have
to let me examine you right.

264
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,590
no,do not.

265
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:32,870
Do. do not touch me.

266
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,430
For the love of.

267
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,450
ay,Dr. Bailey,you have
an emergent situation?

268
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,760
No,he says he wants a male doctor.

269
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,170
He doesn't want my
female hands to touch him.

270
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,990
Let me see his chart.

271
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:46,180
Um,shane. I'm Dr. Webber.

272
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,950
I'm gonna palpate your abdomen.

273
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,620
no,no.

274
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,570
-I thought you said he wanted a male doctor.
-He did.

275
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,980
No,look,I-I just.

276
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,610
I meant. I-I want another.

277
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,010
I want a different doctor. I.

278
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:02,040
I'll wait for a different doctor.

279
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,970
a-a different doctor?

280
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,400
you mean you want a white doctor.

281
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:21,310
I have paramedics hanging upside down.

282
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,310
Can you handle.

283
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,590
this?

284
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,680
Yes,sir. I can.

285
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,830

This is mary daltry. She,uh,lost
consciousness behind the wheel.

287
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,350
You're the neuro guy?

288
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:40,880
Yes,I'm Dr. Shepherd.

289
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,880
-Why did I have a seizure?
-I don't know.

290
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,480
I mean,I've never had a seizure before.

291
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:50,790
I mean,I'm fine,except
apparently I caused this accident.

292
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,740
Call radiology. Let's
get her in for an M.R.I.

293
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,390
Yes,sir.

294
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,320
How's shane. my partner?

295
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,370

296
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,400
-I think he's with Dr. Bailey.
-That's good.

297
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:01,120
Okay,I'm ready to fix the
arm. Are you ready,mary?

298
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:02,710

-Yes,but.

300
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,880
But Dr. Torres is very good.

301
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:10,050
-Okay,Dr. Shepherd,are you good?
-Yeah,I'm good.

302
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,840
All right,as soon as I

Yeah.

308
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:36,310
If we're putting it to a vote,I
think we better get out of here,fast.

309
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:40,280
I'm afraid keep still is
the beste can do for now.

310
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,520
Don't want to make anything worse.

311
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,240

meds as soon as possible.

00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,740
that stupid line about.

347
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,580
about the bet over the song lyrics?

348
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,700
Right.Right.

349
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,410
What was that song?

350
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:53,700
It was,uh.it was.

351
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:01,330
I can see clearly now,the rain is gone.

352
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:09,600
I can see all  the obstacles in my way

353
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:15,330
gonna be a bright  bright

354
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:18,050
sunshiny day

355
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:22,640
it's gonna be a bright  bright

356
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:25,920
sunshiny day

357
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,920
what comes next?

358
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,850
I don't know.

359
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:37,610
I think I can make it now,

360
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,980
the pain is gone.

361
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:50,140
I,um,I can't believe
sara fell for that line.

362
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:55,030
Listen.

363
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,600
when you get outta here.

364
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,170
you're gonna have a great story to tell.

365
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,870
you can tell it in the bar.

366
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,130
You tell 'em how you got

367
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:15,960
into this accident and
your best friend died.

368
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:19,670
Chicks love that stuff.

369
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,660
Ray.

370
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,900
don't tell sara that I was talkin' about
you gettin' tail right before I died.

371
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,260
okay.

372
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,660
she should be here any minute.

373
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,910
Just hold on,stan.

374
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,260
Dr. Sloan.

375
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:45,050
I have a patient,13 days status
post cabg with a sternal infection.

376
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,270
So you're gonna remove the sternum?

377
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,640
And I need you to manipulate
the pectoral muscles

378
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,830
so we don't leave a giant hole in
the man's chest.Can you make time?

379
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,690
Can you make time for
a drink with me after?

380
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,580
Did I mention time is a factor here?

381
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:58,050
I'm looking for a yes or no answer.

382
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,860
As am I.

383
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,990
this may be enjoyable to you,Dr. Sloan

384
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,320
but I have a patient
in serious condition.

385
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:07,730
I came to you because legend has
it that you're the best in plastics.

386
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:11,700
But if bad jokes and sleazy come-ons
are what I'm in for all afternoon,

387
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,510
I'll page whoever's second best.

388
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,560
Dr. Hahn.

389
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,700
I apologize.

390
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,980
- And I'll clear my schedule.
- Thank you.

391
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,160
O.R.One.

392
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,570
Uh,why don't you clean
this up here and,uh,

393
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:27,380
clear my schedule,and you can scrub in?

394
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,690
Thank you.

395
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,180
Sorry about that.

396
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,590
I'm sorry.I'll be right back.

397
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,310
So.

398
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,080
coffee?

399
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,920
- I can'T.
- You can't?

400
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,630
When I was your patient,you
made time for me.

401
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,990
'Cause you were my patient.

402
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:50,060
And here I thought it
was 'cause you liked me.

403
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:51,810
Look,I'm really sorry.

404
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,170
I gotta finish up with this patient,

405
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:54,590
and then I'm scrubbing in on a surgery,

406
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,080
and it's one I've never seen before.

407
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,950
- Can I watch?
- What?

408
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,590
Can I watch the.the surgery?

409
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,850
- Can I.can you sneak me in?
- No.

410
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:03,920
- You know how much trouble I'd get in for that?
- Come on.

411
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,660
Since when are you a rule follower?

412
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,450
There's always a dozen
people in the back of the O.R.

413
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:09,710
- And there's a gallery.
- Ava.

414
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,980
Please.

415
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,500
We're ready to go.

416
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:20,780
Hold off for a moment.His
wife's arriving.

417
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,130
Stan,sara's here.

418
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:27,140
Stan,wake up,man.Sara's here.

419
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,240
Wake up!

420
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,180
That's good.

421
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:36,110
That's good.

422
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,360
Baby?

423
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,860
Baby.

424
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,680
Hey.

425
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:45,120
your x-ray shows that the
metal's embedded in your femur,

426
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:48,070
so I'm gonna go in and remove
it while Dr. Hahn and Dr. Sloan

427
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,720
repair the damage
caused by the infection.

428
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,810
Repair the damage?

429
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,450
They're removing my chest bone.

430
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,130
Why is this all happening?

431
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:01,500
My kids shouldn't have
to see me this way.

432
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:05,590
It's a dad's job to worry.You
worry about your kids.

433
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,780
worry about 'em every
day of their lives.

434
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:11,090
But they aren't supposed
to have to worry about dad.

435
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,450
They aren't supposed to
have to comfort their mom.

436
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:17,240
why am I back here?

437
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,420
- My kids.
- your kids are fine.

438
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:23,140
They're taking care of
each other,and they're fine.

439
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,060
Lucy was hungry,and the others were,too,

440
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,600
so your wife took them to the cafeteria.

441
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:30,440
The point is,th're fine.

442
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,780
They just want their dad to get better.

443
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,760
You'll keep an eye on 'em?

444
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,070
When I'm in surgery,you'll
keep them updated?

445
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,120
'Cause my wife,she,uh.

446
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:45,010
huh,she gets panicky if she
doesn't know what's going on.

447
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,560
I will keep her updated.

448
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:52,620
Uh,I would like to borrow Dr. Yang.

449
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,630
It's important.Can you spare her?

450
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,250
Torres,can I steal
stevens off your service?

451
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,130
I'll give her away for free.

452
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,760
- Yang's all yours,Dr. Bailey.
- Thank you.

453
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:04,250
Yang,stevens.

454
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:07,480
Dr. Yang,Dr. Bailey has
requested your capable hands.

455
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:10,670
Dr. Stevens,take over prepping
Mr. Nolston for surgery.

456
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:11,540
But what.wait.

457
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:14,280
oh,just take it up with Dr. Bailey,yang.

458
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:17,270
Hey.

459
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:18,260
Hey.

460
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,190
- Mary's scans come up yet?
- not yet.

461
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:27,740
What's going on with you and stevens?

462
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,530
Just because I don't sleep in your house

463
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,240
anymore doesn't mean I
don't hear the gossip.

464
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:34,000
Why arwe talking about
this?We don't talk.

465
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,160
oh,you're.

466
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,260
you miss meredith and you're clinging.

467
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,480
I'm not clinging.

468
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,460
- Oh,a little bit,you're clinging.
- No,I'm just making small talk.

469
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,980
Ah,um,okay.

470
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:46,340
here we go.

471
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,020
tumor.

472
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:02,430
look,I'm hurt.I'm.I'm really hurt here.

473
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,100
You just lie there and try not to die.

474
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:07,040
Someone will be here soon to save
the master race from extinction.

475
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,730
- Oh,okay.
- Dr. Bailey,can i talk to you a minute?

476
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,390
I mean no disrespect,

477
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:14,060
but can you please tell me you
have an amazingly good reason

478
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:15,970
for pulling me off of Dr. Hahn's service

479
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,540
when you know I have been fighting tooth
and nail to get into her good graces?

480
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:20,780
You're not black.

481
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,740
But you're not white either.

482
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:26,490
Dr. Yang will be examining you.

483
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,210
Oh,come on.Are you kidding?

484
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,750
Okay,you have medical training.

485
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,370
How long do you think you have to
live if you have internal injuries?

486
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,920
Exactly.

487
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,900
I seriously recommend you let
this fine doctor examine you.

488
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:42,480
Dr. Yang,give him the best
medical treatment possible.

489
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,570
It's the law.

490
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,000
Sir,I need you to move your hands.

491
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,340
Look,I-I just didn't want her to see.

492
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,860
I thought she might
take offense,you know?

493
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:16,340
I'm not gonna leave you.

494
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:19,480
I'm not leaving here
right now without you.Okay?

495
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,210
I've never seen her before.

496
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,460
What?

497
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:24,710
I've never seen her before.

498
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,210
I've worked inhis
hospital all this time,

499
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,070
and before today,she was
a complete stranger to me.

500
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,030
It happens.It's a big hospital.

501
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,190
I've never met her before,and yet,

502
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:41,410
I'm the person who handed
her the worst day of her life.

503
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,900
In her story,that's who I am.

504
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:48,960
That's who I'll always be.

505
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,340
That's theob.

506
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:59,070
that's the job.I know.

507
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,990
Look at me.

508
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:07,660
This day,this day you feel helpless.

509
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,680
This day makes all those other days

510
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:12,880
when you fight to save a life and lose.

511
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,490
this day makes you grateful you
have a chance to do anything at all.

512
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,690
You take it in.

513
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,340
it's time.

514
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,740
can you go easy?I'm injured here.

515
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:55,100
You've had plenty of
morphine.You'll be fine.

516
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:58,150
It's not like you're in a
concentration camp or anything.

517
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,230
You know,when people are young
or.or drunk,they get tattoos.

518
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,760
They wake up to regret it.

519
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,470
Oh,so you regret it?

520
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,800
You gotta treat me like anyone else.

521
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,670
That's the beauty of this country.

522
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,490
Oh,yes,it is.

523
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:19,400
So.

524
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,510
you're gonna drill into my skull?

525
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:23,880
O'malley.

526
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:27,110
Dr. Shepherd's gonna do what
we call a cookie craniotomy.

527
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:30,070
Uh,he's gonna drill a
very,very small hole,

528
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:32,880
and then with a computer,he's going
to guide the scope through your brain.

529
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:35,500
It's as minimally invasive as possible.

530
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,140
It's just.

531
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:42,030
it's weird,you know,to be on
the other side of all this.

532
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:44,710
How are stan and ray.

533
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,210
and shane?Oh,my god.

534
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:50,690
Oh,my god.How did this happen?

535
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,430
she's seizing.

536
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,630
I always knew you were
an ass,but seriously,

537
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,330
you brought jane doe into the gallery?

538
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:07,170
Are you trying to get yourself
kicked out of the program?

539
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,970
She wanted to see what I do.

540
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:11,360
I thought you were seeing lexie.

541
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:12,710
I'm a popular guy.

542
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:15,540
I'm sure whatever you're talking
about is endlessly fascinating,

543
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:19,270
Dr. Karev,but I kind of had my
heart set on saving a life today.

544
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,220
Sorry.

545
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,760
so.let's begin.

546
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:30,240
Hey.Nurse olivia said you
needed to see me.Are you okay?

547
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,670
My book is bad,

548
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:36,420
and I hate daytime televisio
and all my friends are at work.

549
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:38,090
Yeah,well,I'm at work,too.I'm an intern.

550
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,800
I'm supposed to be learning things.

551
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:42,140
You can.you can learn about my artery.

552
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:44,370
You can never know too
much about arteries,right?

553
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:46,460
Come on.I have no one to talk to.

554
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:49,280
- Fine,but I'm taking your vitals again.
- Okay.

555
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:54,590
So,uh,you want to help
me plot my revenge?

556
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:56,300
Girlfriend?

557
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:58,030
Here's what I'm thinking.

558
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,950
I page her here,and
then,uh,you know,I'm all,like,"

559
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:08,510
I'm dying,and I just need to gaze at
your beauty one last time," and then.

560
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,660
and then she gets here,and
I flash her the artery.

561
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,370
- It's mean.
- Right?

562
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,850
- I like it.
- Okay.Can you get me a phone?

563
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,810
Gentlemen,the moment
they pull apart the rig,

564
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:22,160
we're gonna come in and grab you.

565
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:23,930
You take sn,first.

566
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,300
Once we get in there and
assess,then we'll see who goes first.

567
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:29,110
No,you take stan first.

568
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,170
You take stan first.

569
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:33,240
Ray.

570
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,380
I think I'm gonna be okay.

571
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,490
I'm starting to feel a little better.

572
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:39,500
- Don't you screw with me.
- No.

573
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:43,360
No,I'm probably not as bad as I think.

574
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:46,030
I'm probably just paralyzed.

575
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:48,840
Richard.

576
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:51,080
you think maybe that

577
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:54,160
I can get out of here
just paralyzed,right?

578
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:03,970
It's possible.It happens.

579
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,970
Really?

580
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,430
See?

581
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,760
O-okay.Okay.

582
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:18,970
Is my wife inside?

583
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:22,370
- She won't see any of this?
- No.

584
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:25,220
You'll be where I can look at you?

585
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:28,210
I'm right here,where you can look at me.

586
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,930
Then let's do this.

587
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:47,140
Try to live,man.

588
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,240
You,too.

589
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,110
stop.Stop.

590
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:03,670
Stop!Stop!

591
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,710
Make them stop!

592
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,800
Stop!Stop!

593
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,860
What the hell are you doing?

594
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,010
It's stan!

595
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:15,150
Ray.ray's back.

596
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,970
it's in deep.

597
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:19,460
He'll bleed out if you move us.

598
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:24,450
It's the oxygen regulator.

599
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:27,290
It's embedded in his back.

600
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:32,050
Ray!Ray,you still with us?

601
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:36,220
I'm here,chief.I'm still here.

602
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,450
But my pulse is weak.

603
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:45,740
okay,he's sweaty and breathing fast,and with the angle of that regulator.

604
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,330
it's cardiac tamponade.

605
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:52,990
If that regulator caused a tear in his heart and we move him,
the regulator could move.

606
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,450
It'll make the tear bigger.

607
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:59,750
Please let's don't flood my heart.Please.

608
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,210
We'll stabilize him in the ambulance.

609
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,140
Stan.

610
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:05,920
you're a hero,man.

611
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:08,520
You saved ray's life.

612
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:16,350
Stan?

613
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:20,240
Damn it,stan.Stan.

614
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:29,750
go get the ultrasound so we can be sure,
and bring a crash cart just in case,

615
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:31,870
and go find where hahn is.

616
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,550
Hey.Films are up.

617
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,480
Yeah,there's intraperitoneal bleeding.

618
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:40,110
His liver looks completely ruptured.

619
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:43,740
Yeah,he's gonna need a laparotomy,
but maybe it'll be pretty straightforward.

620
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:46,610
Oh,so I can get back to hahn's service?

621
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:48,060
-Or not?
-No.

622
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:52,130
- If I have to work on this man,so do you.
- Why?

623
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:55,090
You don't need me.

624
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:59,870
He has a swastika on his abdomen,a giant black swastika.

625
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:03,160
My stepfather's parents died in auschwitz.

626
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:09,330
okay.

627
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:12,170
You and I will do this.

628
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:17,270
We will do this and we will consider ourselves having risen above.

629
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:21,350
We'll rise...above.

630
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:37,520
You're busted.

631
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,540
Save it.

632
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:43,310
you're using a cable instead of wires,Dr. Sloan.

633
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:44,980
I've never seen it done that way before.

634
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,740
Tension banding.Learned it back in new york.

635
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:52,880
I moved there after columbia to study under john seever.

636
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,110
He was a great surgeon.

637
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:57,340
He died last year.

638
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:00,220
I was wrecked,couldn't sleep for weeks.

639
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,070
It was like losing my own father.

640
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,210
What,are we on a date here?

641
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,710
I was complimenting your surgical skills,Dr. Sloan,

642
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:09,700
not looking for a window into your wounded soul.clamp,please.

643
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:11,890
You can't operate.

644
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,590
I won't sign the consent form.

645
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:15,070
You need the surgery.

646
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,620
You will die without the surgery.

647
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:19,120
You may die with the surgery,but your chance of living

648
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,410
is greatly increased if you let me operate.

649
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:25,020
And it's just gonna be you two in there?

650
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,400
- Yes.
- No.

651
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,400
I need to have at least one white doctor

652
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,180
in that operating room so you don't kill me on the table.

653
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,770
-No offense.
-No offense?

654
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:37,570
Did he just say no offense?

655
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,070
- Shepherd.
- Yeah.

656
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:39,940
I need o'malley.

657
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:40,780
We're about to go into surgery.

658
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,170
I need o'malley.

659
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:42,960
You okay,Dr. Bailey?

660
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,990
Don't cross me.

661
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,650
Oh,I wasn't crossing you.

662
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:46,710
I'm rising above.

663
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:51,550
I am rising above and do not 
want to be crossed while I'm busy rising.

664
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:55,330
I have to operate on a 
white supremacist,

665
00:33:55,370 --> 00:34:01,490
and he has requested a white doctor 
to watch me to make sure that
I don't kill his crazy white hind.

666
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:03,670
Now I need o'malley.
Can I have him or not?

667
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,110
Yeah,o'malley,go with Dr. Bailey.

668
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,050
Yes,sir.

669
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:10,550
Get him to sign the consent,
then have him anesthetized and ready.

670
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:17,540
Dr. Bailey,you're well within your 
rights to pass this on to somebody else.

671
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:22,870
Well,that would make me like him,
and I'm not like him.

672
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,780
Oh,sorry,Dr. Shepherd,
I'm running behind today.

673
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,600
I'll be out of your way in just a second.

674
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:34,190
Well,actually,rose,I'm early,so 
technically,I'm in your way.

675
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:37,400
Oh,well,in that case,don't let it happen again.

676
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,370
You're staring at my chest.

677
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:41,400
What?

678
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,670
I think maybe you're intending to admire my ring,
but it's coming off as you staring at my chest.

679
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:50,540
Oh,sorry.It's just that,uh,you wear your 
engagement ring on your necklace.

680
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,280
When I was engaged,I wore it on my finger.

681
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,800
Now,yeah,necklace.

682
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,310
The stone was my grandmother's.
I don't want to lose it.

683
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:58,050
-Sorry.-Sorry,why?

684
00:34:58,090 --> 00:34:59,680
About your engagement.

685
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,330
Did you call it off recently?

686
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,370
well,that's a pretty personal question.

687
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,620
Yeah,well,we're friends now.

688
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:08,380
I mean,I saved you hours of 
potential licorice humiliation,
so I think you can.

689
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,840
it ended a year ago,and you have 
nothing to be sorry about.

690
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,760
- It was never gonna work out.
- How come?

691
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,410
Because I was always very clear 
about what I wanted,and he wasn't.

692
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,830
And there's no way to build a future on that.

693
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,140
Yeah.

694
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:27,660
Please,please.I-I can't be in here!
I'm gonna die in here!

695
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,480
no,no,ray,ray!Ray,you can't do that.

696
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:31,320
You have to stay perfectly still.

697
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,320
You cannot move.

698
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,100
ray,look at me.

699
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:37,710
Don't look at stan.Look at me.

700
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:44,630
You are not gonna die today.
Okay?Say it.

701
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,460
I'm not gonna die.

702
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:50,150
You are not going to die today.

703
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:55,550
He'll need a pericardiocentesis if it's a tamponade,
but we need to get an ultrasound to be sure.

704
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:56,750
I can do it.I can get in.

705
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:59,880
- Meredith.
- I can fit.

706
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,290
Dr. Bailey.

707
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,520
I'm calling on jesus this time.

708
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,720
Don't bother me when I'm calling on jesus.

709
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,690
I don't do it very often.

710
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,070
He might not hear me.

711
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:44,440
Scalpel.

712
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:23,140
it's amazing,isn't it?

713
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:26,670
The...how tenical it all is,
how impersonal?

714
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:29,020
They're...they're basically 
just mechanics,but,like,

715
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:34,650
god's mechanics because what 
they're actually doing down there is saving a life.

716
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:39,220
so you're a-a surgeon?

717
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,600
Surgical intern,first year.

718
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,520
What about you?

719
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:50,490
Oh,um.I'm not actually supposed to be here.

720
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:54,160
The guy that I'm...I'm,you know.

721
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:56,180
your...your husband?

722
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,510
No.No,no,not my husband.

723
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:02,750
The guy that.anyways,I'm just...I 
wanted to see him operate.

724
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,130
Oh,Dr. Sloan.

725
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:05,910
Oh,I get it.

726
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:09,570
No,no,I'm not judging.I mean,
he's kind of insanely hot.

727
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:15,330
We...he is,but I'm not...
I'm not with him.I'm with...him.

728
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:19,720
Do you know him?

729
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:23,350
No.No,I-I don't knowim at all.

730
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:35,510
I'm supposed to be having lunch 
with my husband,o'malley.

731
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:36,840
Yes,ma'am.

732
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:44,880
I'm supposed to be having lunch with my husband,
and instead I am elbow deep in a nazi's gut.

733
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,570
Yes,ma'am.

734
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,910
No one better ever call me "nazi" again.

735
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:56,330
okay

736
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:01,430
a little suction right there,please.

737
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,980
that's good...Good.Okay.

738
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:09,600
All right.I should be able to access the tumor now.

739
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:12,660
what's going on?Did we lose power?

740
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:14,280
No,the other monitors are fine.

741
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,930
It must be the stereotactic computer.

742
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,010
nothing.It's dead.

743
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:20,450
Are you kiddme?

744
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:21,250
I'm in the woman's brain.

745
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,970
Are you kidding me?
The navigational system is dead?

746
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:24,330
she should we try to get another machine?

747
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:25,850
Look, if I remove the probe without a guide,

748
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:27,390
it won't be just the machine that's dead. 
Call the company.

749
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:28,980
Tell them to get over here as 
quickly as possible.

750
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:31,100
Tell 'em we need somebody here now.

751
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,430
take it slow,grey.

752
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:35,150
There's...there's glass all around you.

753
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:47,840
I'm sorry,stan.

754
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,560
Oh,I'm so sorry.

755
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,370
Here.

756
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:54,150
He's okay.

757
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,440
He doesn't mind.

758
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,260
We're losing him,chief.

759
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:59,820
Okay,get in there,grey.Don't worry 
about stan.Just get in there.

760
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,430
- Hey.
- Hi.

761
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:06,810
You,uh,checking in on me again?

762
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:08,480
Yep.

763
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,240
Will you call me strong and stable again?

764
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,250
Let's hope.

765
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,740
What's wrong with you?

766
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,790
What makes you think something's wrong?

767
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:21,000
Well,your cheeks are all flushed,which they.

768
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,930
they weren't earlier.

769
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:25,130
Is it creeping you out,how 
observant I am?

770
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:28,590
I'm sorry.It's the...it's the boredom,
I'm telling you.

771
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:36,260
remember your girlfriend who just 
turned out to be a vapid narcissist?

772
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:38,570
Your boyfriend turned out to just be a jerk.

773
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:45,370
Jerk,ass,and many dirtier words that are 
inappropriate for me to use in front of a patient.

774
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,670
I'm sorry.

775
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:49,980
Yeah,me,too.

776
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:53,350
Well,you want me to help you plot your revenge?

777
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,650
- Okay.
- Okay.

778
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:57,310
Here's what I'm thinking.

779
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:58,790
you go out with me.

780
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:01,930
Just like that.bam.new boyfriend.

781
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:05,940
And he'll be all,"what's he got that I don't have?

782
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:08,960
" And you'll be all,"carotid artery.

783
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:11,870
exposed.Top that,loser.

784
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:14,400
" And he'll be all,"I can'T.

785
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,040
- I can't top that.
- " No.

786
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,460
"I am a loser.

787
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,940
to be continued.
