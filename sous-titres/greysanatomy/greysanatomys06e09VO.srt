1
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:22,689
But as hard as we try to move forward...

2
00:00:22,757 --> 00:00:27,360
as tempting as it is to never look back...

3
00:00:27,428 --> 00:00:30,664
the past always comes back
to bite us in the ass.

4
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:32,532
Meredith. Hey.

5
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,902
Thanks for meeting me down here.
Are you okay? Where have you been?

6
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,871
I'm fine. I've been in Chehalis with my mom.

7
00:00:37,939 --> 00:00:41,541
This is not Chehalis. Where the hell are we?
We're in Seattle, Dr. Singer.

8
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:45,178
And this is Dr. Grey, my friend.
This is Dr. Singer.

9
00:00:44,646 --> 00:00:47,414
He was my high school science
teacher... a brilliant man.

10
00:00:47,482 --> 00:00:50,084
He really fought for me and he's
the reason I became a surgeon.

11
00:00:50,151 --> 00:00:52,353
I appreciate your taking
the time to see us, Dr. Grey,

12
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,855
But I promised Isobel's algebra II teacher

13
00:00:54,923 --> 00:00:57,958
that I'd have her back in time for fifth period.
I'm confused.

14
00:00:58,026 --> 00:01:00,160
So is he. The nursing home
diagnosed him with Alzheimer's.

15
00:01:00,228 --> 00:01:02,396
But he's been falling a lot lately,

16
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:04,798
and I think he could have a bleed.
Well, he's wearing pajamas
and an overcoat.

17
00:01:04,866 --> 00:01:07,234
What did you do, sneak him out
in the middle of the night?
No.

18
00:01:07,302 --> 00:01:09,236
Early this morning.
You kidnapped him?

19
00:01:09,304 --> 00:01:12,039
Can you please just... can you
sneak him in to see Derek?

20
00:01:12,107 --> 00:01:14,942
Put him on the schedule, please.
Izzie, you've been in Chehalis
this whole time,

21
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,344
and the only reason
you came back is to bring

22
00:01:17,412 --> 00:01:19,913
a confused, sickly man for Derek to look at?
Yes.

23
00:01:19,981 --> 00:01:22,583
Ow! Ow! Stop hitting me.

24
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,852
We were worried about you.
I was worried about you.

25
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:27,287
Look, please, can you please
just get him in to see derek?

26
00:01:27,355 --> 00:01:29,690
I'll be back later.
I'll be back, okay?

27
00:01:29,758 --> 00:01:32,092
No, you cannot leave him here.
I'm not going in there.

28
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,528
You need to let Alex know you're okay.

29
00:01:34,596 --> 00:01:37,531
I am not going in there.
Oh, yes, you're going in. So he
got you pregnant. So what?

30
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:40,134
You're pregnant?
No. He thinks I'm 15 years old.

31
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:42,236
Right. Right.
So you're gonna go right into that school

32
00:01:42,303 --> 00:01:44,238
and show those cheerleaders

33
00:01:44,305 --> 00:01:46,440
that you have nothing to be ashamed of.

34
00:01:46,508 --> 00:01:48,642
Those little bitches are poisonous.

35
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,911
And as history shows us again and again,

36
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:54,881
those who forget the past
are doomed to repeat it.

37
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:57,050
Cristina.

38
00:01:57,118 --> 00:01:58,551
Dr. Yang.

39
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,020
Dr. Avery.

40
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:01,621
Look, okay, about the kiss...

41
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:04,624
Kiss, what kiss?
There was no kiss.

42
00:02:04,692 --> 00:02:06,926
I don't know what you're talking about.

43
00:02:09,497 --> 00:02:12,365
So do you have a boyfriend or...
Never gonna happen.

44
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:14,267
Got it. Thanks.

45
00:02:14,335 --> 00:02:16,202
Hey, you paged us.

46
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,605
Oh, I paged you.
One second, Dr. Avery.

47
00:02:18,673 --> 00:02:21,007
Um, I know you think
I don't understand you,

48
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:23,043
so I got you a present.

49
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,546
Come on. Come on.
I don't want to lose him.

50
00:02:26,614 --> 00:02:29,315
All right. What do we got?
Fine v-fib. Paddles.

51
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:31,418
You got me a cardiac trauma.

52
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,486
I didn't just get you a cardiac trauma.

53
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:36,156
I got you a cardio God, uh, uh, or goddess.

54
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:38,625
Saline. Lock and load to 50.

55
00:02:38,693 --> 00:02:40,393
Clear.

56
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:43,363
Nothing.

57
00:02:43,431 --> 00:02:45,398
Come on. Come on!

59
00:02:52,507 --> 00:02:55,409
Nice to meet you. Jackson Avery.
Teddy Altman.

60
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:58,412
Teddy Altman. I...
I've never heard of you.

61
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,781
Cristina Yang. I... I've never
heard of you either.

62
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:03,650
So I guess that makes us even.

63
00:03:03,718 --> 00:03:05,586
Teddy and I, we served in Iraq together,

64
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:08,088
and she's gonna be joining us for a little while.

65
00:03:08,156 --> 00:03:10,190
Okay. Come on, I'll introduce you to the chief.

66
00:03:10,258 --> 00:03:12,426
Oh, great. You look good.
Oh, thanks.

67
00:03:12,493 --> 00:03:14,494
You know, you've put on a little weight.
I have not.

68
00:03:14,562 --> 00:03:16,463
You have, too.
I have not.

69
00:03:16,531 --> 00:03:18,031
Who the hell is she?

70
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:19,933
Go to the pacu and write the post-op note

71
00:03:20,001 --> 00:03:21,635
on Mrs. Murdoch.
Hey.

72
00:03:21,703 --> 00:03:24,137
Hey, thanks.
Do you want me to page you
if there are any complications?

73
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:26,306
The chief of surgery, Dr. Richard Webber?
Yes.

74
00:03:26,374 --> 00:03:28,976
Miranda, there you are.
Adele.

75
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:31,812
Uh, you all right? Is everything okay?
Richard didn't come home last night,

76
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,880
and he didn't call.

77
00:03:33,948 --> 00:03:36,283
Tell me he's not lying
somewhere in a ditch dead.

78
00:03:36,351 --> 00:03:38,285
Okay, uh, the last time I saw him was, um,

79
00:03:38,353 --> 00:03:41,355
last night in his office.
He was working on the budget.

80
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:44,091
So why didn't he answer
his pager or his cell phone?

81
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:46,059
Okay, well, hold on, hold on.

82
00:03:46,127 --> 00:03:48,262
And why doesn't anybody in this hospital

83
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:50,197
know where the chief of surgery is?

84
00:03:50,265 --> 00:03:52,432
Dr. Bailey. Have you seen the chief?

85
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,635
One of his patients
needs an emergency chole.

86
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:58,739
Okay, I'm on it. Uh, you
go ahead and prep the patient.

87
00:03:58,806 --> 00:04:00,807
You get yourself a cup of coffee... decaf.

88
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:03,977
I will find the chief.

89
00:04:05,947 --> 00:04:07,781
So you're an evolutionary biologist?

90
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:11,385
Mm. I was. I was part of a research team...

91
00:04:11,452 --> 00:04:13,820
On my way to the Galápagos Islands,

92
00:04:13,888 --> 00:04:15,956
and suddenly, my father died.

93
00:04:16,024 --> 00:04:18,992
And, uh, of course I had to go home.

94
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,128
Next thing I know, I'm back in Chehalis,

95
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:24,464
marrying my high school sweetheart

96
00:04:24,532 --> 00:04:28,134
And teaching biology to kids who
would rather be anywhere else.
Mm-hmm.

97
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:31,971
I hear you're
an excellent teacher.
Isobel is
an excellent student.

98
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:34,641
She's gonna be
a doctor herself someday...
(chuckles)

99
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:38,044
If she doesn't get
too distracted.

100
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:39,679
Hmm.

101
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:42,615
Well, everything looks good, Dr. Singer.

102
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:45,618
What we're gonna do is, uh, take some blood...
Ouch.

103
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:47,887
And run some tests. Okay?
Okay.

104
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:50,990
All right. Stevens.

105
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:53,960
How long has he been like this?
Um, I talked to him at Christmas,

106
00:04:54,028 --> 00:04:56,763
and he was fine. He was still teaching.

107
00:04:56,831 --> 00:04:58,798
The school only let him go six months ago.

108
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:01,501
Is he on any medication?
He's on every medication... Alzheimer's meds,

109
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:04,470
Parkinson's meds, antidepressants.
What was his diagnosis?

110
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:06,673
Dementia. The guy was useless.
He might as well

111
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,675
have just said old age. It's possible.

112
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:10,610
He's 67. Andf he fell and hit his head,

113
00:05:10,678 --> 00:05:12,612
he could have an intracranial bleed,

114
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,814
and no one would know about it.

115
00:05:14,882 --> 00:05:17,817
His wife is dead. He has no kids, so...
Where the hell have you been?!

116
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:20,353
You missed your I.L.-2 appointment.
You told Cristina I was here?
Mer, who else did you tell?

117
00:05:20,421 --> 00:05:22,889
Well, well, well. Look who's back.
This guy?

118
00:05:22,957 --> 00:05:25,458
You told the guy that got me fired?
I didn't tell him. I don't even know him.

119
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:29,028
It's my first day back.
Dr. Percy's on my service today.

120
00:05:29,096 --> 00:05:32,031
Oh.
And I didn't get you fired.
You did that all by yourself.

121
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:35,668
Dr. Percy, Dr. Singer needs
a full dementia work-up.

122
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:38,137
Dr. Stevens will give you the details.

123
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:40,640
I wish Dr. Stevens would give me the details.

124
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:43,376
But I'm just the person who saved her life.

125
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:46,446
Okay. Do you know, if you miss
another I.L.-2 treatment...

126
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,248
I got my I.L.-2 treatment at Seattle Pres.

127
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:50,483
I may not be a doctor here anymore,

128
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:52,919
but I'm not a complete idiot.
Iz.

129
00:06:17,093 --> 00:06:18,527
You heard from Xasella?

130
00:06:18,595 --> 00:06:20,296
Yeah, I heard he took another tour.

131
00:06:20,363 --> 00:06:22,331
I'm sorry. Where were you
before, Dr. Altman?

132
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:24,323
In Baghdad with Dr. Hunt.
Oh, no. I mean before that.

133
00:06:24,534 --> 00:06:26,026
Where did you do your fellowship?
At Mayo.

134
00:06:26,378 --> 00:06:28,288
Oh, with Paul Moak?
No, Moak is in rochester.

135
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:33,457
I worked primarily with joshua moore.
Oh, you were at mayo in florida.

136
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,411
Moore wrote that paper

137
00:06:34,878 --> 00:06:37,246
on retrograde coronary
sinus perfusion, right?

138
00:06:37,514 --> 00:06:38,844
Yeah. I actually worked on that with him.

140
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:45,179
Dr. Yang is, uh, a little thorough.
U.T. Southwestern.

141
00:06:45,179 --> 00:06:49,024
And then I did my residency at g.W.
Well, I mean, have you published?

142
00:06:49,092 --> 00:06:51,560
'Cause according to Google,
I mean, you don't exist.

143
00:06:51,628 --> 00:06:55,764
Oh, my God.
It's raining.

144
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,167
Yeah, it's Seattle. It rains a lot.

145
00:06:58,235 --> 00:07:00,936
Whoo! Hunt, how awesome is this?

146
00:07:01,304 --> 00:07:04,640
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

147
00:07:03,907 --> 00:07:07,944
She's been living in the desert
for a long time.

148
00:07:14,485 --> 00:07:16,819
Ooh.

149
00:07:16,887 --> 00:07:19,622
That is not a cardio God.

150
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,791
She's an incredible surgeon.

151
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:24,794
This is great.

152
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:27,497
So what's your story?

153
00:07:27,564 --> 00:07:32,201
There's no story. We're friends.

154
00:07:32,269 --> 00:07:35,171
How long is she here for?
Well, the chief offered her
a limited contract

155
00:07:35,239 --> 00:07:36,672
to test the waters.

156
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,975
Look, you know, I really
appreciate the gift. Really, I do.

157
00:07:39,043 --> 00:07:42,145
But you need to take it back.

158
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:42,715
Cristina..

159
00:07:42,716 --> 00:07:43,716
You need to take it back and exchange it

160
00:07:43,716 --> 00:07:44,716
for a real cardio God.

161
00:07:44,717 --> 00:07:45,717
Just give her a chance.

162
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:50,219
I promise. She's gonna surprise you.

163
00:07:52,022 --> 00:07:54,490
Grab this one.

164
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:57,226
I guess you do have a boyfriend.

165
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,868
Are those his test resul let me see them.

166
00:08:05,936 --> 00:08:07,870
If you were a doctor here, I could.

167
00:08:07,938 --> 00:08:10,006
They're normal, all of them.

168
00:08:10,074 --> 00:08:12,809
Blood work, C.T....
All normal. We need to do a spinal tap.

169
00:08:12,876 --> 00:08:15,545
He could have a subarachnoid hemorrhage.
What...

170
00:08:15,612 --> 00:08:18,047
Did you think if you made
some great neuro save,

171
00:08:18,115 --> 00:08:20,183
Shepherd would give you your job back?

172
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,185
I'm not here to get my job back.
Hello?

173
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,520
Hello? Hello?
Good. 'cause it's not gonna happen.

174
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:26,355
Dr. Singer...

175
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,691
Hello? Can someone...
I'm here. I'm here.

176
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:31,494
Ooh, what's happening? What's happening?

177
00:08:31,562 --> 00:08:34,197
No, no. One minute, I'm in class, and then...

178
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,833
And then the next minute, I'm...
You're here at Seattle Grace
hospital, remember?

179
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,835
I brought... I am not! No, I'm not.

180
00:08:38,902 --> 00:08:40,837
Yes. No, I brought you here,
remember?
No, it's not possible.

181
00:08:40,904 --> 00:08:43,206
No, no, no, Dr. Singer, please...
I have a class. It's late.
What time is it?

182
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,741
Please come back to bed.
Please come back to bed.
No, no! Let me go!

183
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:49,612
Dr. Singer! Oh, my God. Dr. Singer.

184
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,148
What's happening to me?

185
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,393
Chief!
Oh!

186
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:06,829
What do we got?!
An emergency chole,

187
00:09:06,897 --> 00:09:08,331
a new cardio attending,

188
00:09:08,398 --> 00:09:10,967
and your wife is here to see you.

189
00:09:11,034 --> 00:09:12,468
What?

190
00:09:12,536 --> 00:09:15,905
You in trouble. Drink your latte.

191
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:17,740
He needs a spinal tap.

192
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:19,742
He's fallen and could've
burst an aneurysm,

193
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,044
and some bleeds show up on a
spinal tap that don't on a C.T.

194
00:09:22,112 --> 00:09:24,547
And some doctors
enjoy torturing patients

195
00:09:24,615 --> 00:09:26,549
because they've messed up and don't know

196
00:09:26,617 --> 00:09:29,085
what they're gonna do
with the rest of their lives.

197
00:09:29,153 --> 00:09:31,254
You are the one that got me fired.

198
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:34,257
You owe me this, you little bitch.

199
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,325
Unless, of course, you want me to find

200
00:09:36,393 --> 00:09:38,094
that snotty reed what's her name

201
00:09:38,162 --> 00:09:42,131
and tell her how much you
love her, 'cause I will.

202
00:09:44,434 --> 00:09:46,636
Sick sinus syndrome.
She needs a temporary ansvenous

203
00:09:46,703 --> 00:09:49,672
pacemaker now.
Dr. Yang, do you want to take this
one? I haven't done one  of these

204
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,108
in ten years.
Excuse me?

205
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:55,111
I do.
Great, it's all yours.

206
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:57,780
Wait. Uh, you don't remember how to or...
I've been working primarily
on soldiers, Dr. Yang,

207
00:09:57,848 --> 00:10:00,283
most of whom are well under the age of 70.

208
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,351
Use the right I.J., Dr. Avery.

209
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:04,554
It'll give you the most direct approach.

210
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:10,326
Dr. Altman, will you excuse
me just for a moment?

211
00:10:10,394 --> 00:10:13,896
I... I just need to talk to
the chief about something.

212
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:24,674
She has been staying
with her mom in Chehalis.

213
00:10:24,741 --> 00:10:27,476
Don't know how long
she's staying, if she's staying.

214
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,679
She has been keeping up with her I.L.-2.

215
00:10:29,746 --> 00:10:31,814
That much I do know.

216
00:10:34,785 --> 00:10:37,520
That's all I know.

217
00:10:48,966 --> 00:10:51,334
I was up till all hours
working on the budget.

218
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,869
And by the time you realized what time it was,

219
00:10:53,937 --> 00:10:55,838
it was too late to call and let Adele know

220
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:57,840
you were going to sleep here,

221
00:10:57,908 --> 00:11:00,843
which is what I will tell her
while you're in surgery.
Oh, thank you, Bailey.

222
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:03,813
Chief.
Now is not the time, Yang.
The chief has emergency surgery.

223
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,815
The chief has an emergency cardio situation.

224
00:11:05,882 --> 00:11:07,783
The new attending doesn't even
know how to put in

225
00:11:07,851 --> 00:11:09,652
a temmporary pacemaker.
Yang...

226
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,888
Do not engage. Did you
or did you not ask this man

227
00:11:12,956 --> 00:11:15,291
for a new cardio attending?
Yes, but...

228
00:11:15,359 --> 00:11:18,527
and did he or did he not bring
in attending after attending,

229
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:21,297
none of whom seem to please you
and all of whom you ran off?

230
00:11:21,365 --> 00:11:23,699
That is not a fair assessment.
Dr. Yang, has it ever occurred to you

231
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:26,869
that you might be the problem?

232
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:29,872
R... right. Leave this man alone.
Go torture the new attending.

233
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,074
Sir...
Yang, do as Bailey says.

234
00:11:34,177 --> 00:11:36,646
D you are due in surgery.

235
00:11:36,713 --> 00:11:39,615
Bailey, what would I do without you?

236
00:11:39,683 --> 00:11:42,084
Let's hope you never have to find out.

237
00:11:42,152 --> 00:11:45,721
Hey, is your trauma patient stable for skin grafting?
The one with the pancreatic duct rupture.

238
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:47,757
Miranda.
Oh, Adele.

239
00:11:47,824 --> 00:11:51,727
Oh, I'm so sorry. I sent
the chief into surgery.

240
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:53,763
Do you want me to...
What I want

241
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,265
is for you to tell me the truth.

242
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:15,266
I saw the way
you handled him just now.

243
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:18,136
I did not handle him. I j...

244
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:20,972
There was no handle... we work together.

245
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,907
You spend every waking moment together.

246
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:24,542
You finish each other's sentences.

247
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,478
You read each other's minds.

248
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:28,379
You're more married to that man than I am.

249
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:31,583
Yeah, but that's just because
they're husband and work-wife.

250
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,419
Excuse me?
The chief's your work-husband,
and you're his work-wife.

251
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:37,789
You look out for each other.
You take care of each other.

252
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:40,425
There's nothing wrong with it.
It's like me and Sloan.
Excuse me?

253
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:43,261
Nobody's talking to you.
He's my work-husband,

254
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:45,864
but he has a girlfriend,
and I have a girlfriend,

255
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,800
but there's nothing going on between us.
I mean, there was at one point...

256
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:51,503
You're not helping. Neither
one of you are helping.

257
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,806
Adele, I promise you, there is nothing going on.
Something is going on,

258
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:57,842
because he hasn't been in his bed all week.
What?

259
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,110
Really?

260
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:01,546
The last time he acted like this... disappearing,

261
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,615
sleeping at the hospital every night...

262
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:05,116
He was with Ellis Grey.

263
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:07,652
He may not be having an affair with you...

264
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,989
He's not. I promise you.
I promise you, he's not.

265
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:16,194
Okay.

266
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:18,797
But wife-wife to work-wife,

267
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:24,469
someone is this hospital
is sleeping with our husband.

268
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:33,044
How are we doing, Dr. Yang?

269
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:36,247
Gary Clark, 57, S.T. elevation
in leads 1 through 4.

270
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,616
Which would indicate?
Anterior heart attack.

271
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:41,386
Probably a blockage in the L.A.D.

272
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:44,189
He's ready for an angioplasty.
All right. Talk me through the procedure.

273
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:46,825
Because you don't remember how?
No, that was actually
a teaching moment.

274
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:48,760
Access the femoral artery,

275
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,695
thread the catheter to the heart,

276
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,797
inject dye, then open up the blockage.

277
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:55,300
Good. Make sure you use the pigtail catheter

278
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,202
to get a good... like this one?

279
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:58,870
Huh.

280
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:01,973
Look at that. Dr. Avery,
what can we infer from this?

281
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:05,310
He's got wall motion abnormalities.
Yes, in the left ventricular wall.

282
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:07,278
Okay, let's get into the left coronary tree.

283
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,214
Already there.

284
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:10,548
Oh.

285
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:13,251
O... okay, um... Well,
you want to make sure

286
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:15,320
that you get images in many planes,
so you're gonna have to shift the fluor

287
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:18,189
Oh, well, we use a
rotational angiography.

288
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:20,124
It does that on its own.

289
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,693
Huh. Look at that.

290
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,029
I guess I'm the one who
learned something today.

291
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:27,332
Yeah. Look at that.

292
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:30,802
Chief.

293
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:32,237
Uh-huh.

294
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,408
Okay, I, uh, I understand, you're under

295
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:40,311
a tremendous amount
of pressure right now

296
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:44,148
and that you haven't been able
to spend time at home...

297
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,084
and that a man in your position

298
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:48,519
has certain...

299
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:49,954
needs...

300
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,591
and that, uh, when a man

301
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:57,595
is as powerful and as attractive as you are,

302
00:14:57,663 --> 00:15:00,932
those needs might easily be met by...

303
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,800
Dr. Bailey.
Yeah, sir.

304
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:04,636
Are you hitting on me?

305
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,571
Your wife just showed up here

306
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,307
asking me if you and I
were having an affair.

307
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:12,210
Well, you know... I... I don't want
to know anything about anything.

308
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:14,679
What you do with your business
is your business.

309
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:18,416
And I was not hitting on you.

310
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,251
Understood.

311
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,786
Mm-hmm.

312
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:29,627
Dr. Percy is almost done

313
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,963
getting the spinal fluid sample he needs.

314
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:34,799
Yeah, not that I had any choice.
That makes two of us.

315
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:37,468
You're doing great. He's almost done.
So what's going on with you and Karev?

316
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,537
Have you even talked to him?

317
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,606
How is that any of your business?

318
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:42,941
It's everybody's business.

319
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:45,310
It's all anybody talks about around here.

320
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:48,646
Stevens and Karev... have they
talked, are they talking?

321
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,315
So are you?

322
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:54,552
That's it. You're all done.

323
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,121
Just need you to lie flat for a while, okay?

324
00:15:57,189 --> 00:16:00,558
See? That wasn't so bad, was it?
So this Karev...

325
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,161
He's the boy, the one who got you in trouble?

326
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:05,196
Well, he didn't help matters much.

327
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:07,632
Did he propose?

328
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,133
Well, whatever you do,

329
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:11,102
don't marry him, because if you do

330
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,072
and you have this child,
you'll never become a surgeon.

331
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:17,442
You'll probably never even
make it out of Chehalis.

332
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:20,378
What you will do, though,
is you'll end up angry

333
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:24,115
and frustrated and, uh... alone.

334
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:29,354
You gotta do what's good for you.

335
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:33,191
And if this boy really cares
for you, he'll understand.

336
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:46,704
How'd you find me here?

337
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:48,172
The nurses love me.

338
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,141
They're my spies, and they're pissed

339
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,110
that you're desterilizing
all their equipment.

340
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,078
What else was I supposed to do?

341
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:57,382
I haven't been able to get
on a surgery all day.

342
00:16:57,449 --> 00:17:00,651
Before I left, there were
five people to compete with,

343
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:03,488
and now there are 25.
You'll get in the O.R. soon enough.

344
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:06,424
You know, there was a moment
for, like five seconds...

345
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:08,393
when hit-by-a-bus guy wasn't George

346
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,529
and Izzie had just come through surgery...

347
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:14,032
you and I had just done our post-it...

348
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:17,201
it was, like, five seconds,
when everybody was happy.

349
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:20,071
I keep closing my eyes
trying to get back to that.

350
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:21,672
Here. Turn around.

351
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,610
Close your eyes.

352
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:32,250
One...

353
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:34,585
Two...

354
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:36,888
Three...

355
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:38,523
Four...

356
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:43,394
Five.

357
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:44,862
How was that?

358
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,330
Almost perfect.

359
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:49,367
Five almost-perfect seconds.

360
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:51,669
Call me when you want
five more, okay?

361
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,942
Stevens.

362
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:01,479
Results of the spinal tap.

363
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:03,448
They're normal.

364
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:04,982
Damn it.

365
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:08,853
I'm sorry for wasting your time.

366
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,559
Dr. Singer?

367
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:16,794
Isobel?

368
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:20,064
Isobel Stevens?

369
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,867
Oh, my God. Look at you... all grown up.

370
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,335
I am?

371
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:27,705
What... what am I doing here?
Why am I in my pajamas?

372
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,675
Is something... is there
something wrong with me, Isobel?

373
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:32,410
He's lucid.

374
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:34,145
Go page Shepherd.

375
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:37,548
Dr. Bailey. Dr. Bailey, do you mind

376
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,051
if I scrub in on the chief's ileostomy?

377
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,554
Yes, I do mind. That man is
old enough to be your father.

378
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,656
Dr. Bailey, have you seen the chief?

379
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:47,992
No. Unh-unh. You don't need
to be seeing the chief,

380
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,495
either one of you.
Okay, but there's something wrong

381
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:52,430
with his emergency chole patient.

382
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:54,799
Ok... so you tell me, and I'll tell the chief.

383
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,801
What's wrong with him?

384
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:59,804
He's yellow.

385
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:02,673
Oh.

386
00:19:11,444 --> 00:19:13,611
This is the yellowest man
that I have ever seen.

387
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,246
Right? He's, like, lemon yellow.

388
00:19:15,314 --> 00:19:17,649
Like mustard yellow.
Hey, hey, we get it. He's yellow.

389
00:19:17,717 --> 00:19:19,718
I'm trying to find out why.

390
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:22,153
Ultrasound shows... dilated ducts.

391
00:19:22,221 --> 00:19:23,621
Which means obstructive jaundice,

392
00:19:23,689 --> 00:19:26,257
but the chief only
took out the gallbladder.

393
00:19:26,325 --> 00:19:29,461
And we never saw any signs of
liver disease or cancers, but...

394
00:19:29,528 --> 00:19:31,529
could that mean...

395
00:19:31,597 --> 00:19:34,466
that the chief accidentally
clipped the common bile duct?
Oh, my God.

396
00:19:34,533 --> 00:19:37,769
Okay, okay, stop...
Right now, both of you.

397
00:19:37,837 --> 00:19:39,337
Now did you actually see

398
00:19:39,405 --> 00:19:42,474
the chief clip the common bile duct?
No, of course not. But...

399
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,476
But nothing. That's one of
the most serious mistakes

400
00:19:44,543 --> 00:19:46,044
a general surgeon can make,

401
00:19:46,112 --> 00:19:48,480
so let's not make this accusation lightly.

402
00:19:48,547 --> 00:19:50,548
It wasn't an accusation...
Uh, stop talking.

403
00:19:50,616 --> 00:19:53,251
Just get an E.R.P. To find the exact cause

404
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:56,021
of this man's discoloration.

405
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,725
And, doctors, if I find out that either of you

406
00:20:00,793 --> 00:20:03,128
has said a word about this to anyone,

407
00:20:03,195 --> 00:20:05,063
I will make sure that you are the ones

408
00:20:05,131 --> 00:20:07,298
who require emergency surgery.

409
00:20:10,136 --> 00:20:12,003
You have a condition called N.P.H....

410
00:20:12,071 --> 00:20:13,805
normal pressure hydrocephalus.

411
00:20:13,873 --> 00:20:15,306
It's a buildup

412
00:20:15,374 --> 00:20:17,475
of cerebrospinal fluid in your brain.

413
00:20:17,543 --> 00:20:19,677
Very hard to, uh, diagnose,
but tnks to Dr. Percy here...

414
00:20:19,745 --> 00:20:22,347
The spinal tap removed some of the fluid,

415
00:20:22,415 --> 00:20:24,849
Relieving the pressure in your
brain, resolving your symptoms,

416
00:20:24,917 --> 00:20:27,585
which is how we came to your diagnosis.
Hmm.

417
00:20:27,586 --> 00:20:31,222
Hmm. Dr. Shepherd wants to
put in a permanent shunt.

418
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:33,158
It'll drain the excess fluid to your abdomen, so...

419
00:20:33,225 --> 00:20:35,593
Oh, that... that sounds like major surgery.
No.

420
00:20:35,661 --> 00:20:37,462
It's 45 minutes. It's a very common procedure.

421
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:39,464
I do it all the time.

422
00:20:39,532 --> 00:20:42,934
Mm-hmm. Well, I don't think
I could afford it.

423
00:20:43,002 --> 00:20:46,004
My savings, my retirement, uh,

424
00:20:46,072 --> 00:20:49,140
it all went to my late wife's medical care.

425
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,776
So, uh...

426
00:20:51,844 --> 00:20:53,945
What do I do?

427
00:20:55,514 --> 00:20:56,915
Dr. Shepherd.

428
00:20:56,982 --> 00:20:57,949
Stevens.

429
00:20:58,017 --> 00:20:59,918
I hate to even ask this of you

430
00:20:59,985 --> 00:21:01,920
after everything you've done for me,

431
00:21:01,987 --> 00:21:04,222
but is there any way
Dr. Singer's surgery

432
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:05,690
could be pro bono?

433
00:21:05,758 --> 00:21:08,193
Look, if you get the chief to sign off  this,

434
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,994
I'd be happy to donate my time.

435
00:21:12,431 --> 00:21:13,731
You don't think it's Bailey?

436
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:14,866
No.

437
00:21:14,934 --> 00:21:17,202
Really? I kinda like them together.

438
00:21:17,269 --> 00:21:20,105
It's not Yang, is it?
What are you guys talking about?

439
00:21:20,172 --> 00:21:23,007
Oh, you haven't heard.
The chief's having an...
Mark, you are a terrible gossip.

440
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:25,343
I'm an excellent gossip.
Hey, mind if we join you?

441
00:21:25,411 --> 00:21:27,312
No, have a seat.
Mnh-mnh. Not at all.

442
00:21:27,379 --> 00:21:29,247
How's your first day going?

443
00:21:29,315 --> 00:21:31,583
You ready to go back to Baghdad yet?

444
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,485
I'm actually really impressed...

445
00:21:33,552 --> 00:21:35,653
the facility, the equipment,
the caliber of the residents.

446
00:21:35,721 --> 00:21:38,590
Have you met Cristina Yang yet?
Mm. Cristina Yang

447
00:21:38,657 --> 00:21:41,459
may in fact be the best
resident I've ever seen.

448
00:21:41,527 --> 00:21:43,361
You think?
Yeah, I do.

449
00:21:43,429 --> 00:21:46,364
I don't think she likes me, but yeah.
Ooh. She doesn't like you?

450
00:21:46,432 --> 00:21:48,800
Mark.
No, you're probably right.

451
00:21:48,868 --> 00:21:50,969
Just because Yang drove off

452
00:21:51,036 --> 00:21:53,404
the last three cardio attendings doesn't mean...
She did not.

453
00:21:53,472 --> 00:21:55,673
Burke?
Come on, that was...
Hahn?

454
00:21:55,741 --> 00:21:58,276
She had nothing to do with hahn leaving.

455
00:21:58,344 --> 00:22:00,278
Nope, that was me.
Dixon?

456
00:22:00,346 --> 00:22:02,947
Cristina just needs
a strong cardio attending,

457
00:22:03,015 --> 00:22:04,916
and she deserves a
strong cardio attending.

458
00:22:04,984 --> 00:22:06,818
Cristina? Huh.

459
00:22:06,886 --> 00:22:08,219
Wow.

460
00:22:08,287 --> 00:22:10,355
So... so you and Yang?

461
00:22:10,422 --> 00:22:12,790
What happened to you and Beth?
Oh, he didn't tell you?

462
00:22:12,858 --> 00:22:15,193
Beth showed up at the hospital one day.

463
00:22:15,261 --> 00:22:16,928
She didn't even know he was... ow!

464
00:22:16,996 --> 00:22:19,597
Did you just kick me?

465
00:22:19,665 --> 00:22:21,733
That was me.
Mmm.

466
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,801
So... wait. Wait. When you called me up

467
00:22:23,869 --> 00:22:25,770
and you told me about this great job

468
00:22:25,838 --> 00:22:27,238
at this great hospital,

469
00:22:27,306 --> 00:22:29,307
you... you were just
bringing me out here

470
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:31,809
as... as a... as a present
for your new girlfriend?

471
00:22:31,877 --> 00:22:35,346
I... it is a great job with great people,

472
00:22:35,414 --> 00:22:38,216
one of whom... just happens to be...

473
00:22:38,284 --> 00:22:41,586
Yeah, yeah, mm-hmm.
That's okay. I'm not mad.

474
00:22:41,654 --> 00:22:44,522
I'm just gonna enjoy all
the ways that you're gonna

475
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,558
have to make it up to me.
Okay.

476
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:49,427
So how do you like your present?

477
00:22:49,495 --> 00:22:51,362
Oh, private Benjamin over there?

478
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:54,098
Owen said she would surprise
me. Well, guess what.

479
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:56,634
Surprise! She doesn't know how to do surgery.

480
00:22:56,702 --> 00:22:58,703
Leave her alone. It's her first day.

481
00:22:58,771 --> 00:23:01,806
Why are you defending her?
She went to state school.
So did I.

482
00:23:01,874 --> 00:23:04,342
Well, she's skinny and blonde.

483
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:06,411
So's mer.

484
00:23:06,478 --> 00:23:08,046
Well, she's annoying.

485
00:23:08,113 --> 00:23:09,881
So are you.

486
00:23:09,949 --> 00:23:12,317
Where is your wife, by the way?

487
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:14,919
I... what did you say to Owen?

488
00:23:14,987 --> 00:23:16,554
Oh, that she's gotta go.

489
00:23:16,622 --> 00:23:18,723
I mean, he knows how
important this is to me.

490
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:21,793
I need someone who's gonna
take me to the next level.

491
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,962
And he brings me, like,
this desert storm Barbie

492
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:27,098
who hasn't seen the inside
of an O.R. in, like, ten years?

493
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:29,467
I mean, if this is what
he thinks of my talent,

494
00:23:29,535 --> 00:23:32,270
then I'm... I... I gotta break up with him.

495
00:23:32,338 --> 00:23:35,039
Have you even talked to Izzie yet

496
00:23:35,107 --> 00:23:39,377
I mean, has anyone talked to her?
You know what? No one's allowed
to talk about Izzie while I eat.

497
00:23:39,445 --> 00:23:42,714
Am I the only one concerned here?

498
00:23:42,781 --> 00:23:44,582
What?
It's my first day back.

499
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:47,218
I just wanted to have a nice,
normal lunch together.

500
00:23:47,286 --> 00:23:49,187
Oh, yeah? Well, take a look around.

501
00:23:49,255 --> 00:23:50,755
Nothing's normal.

502
00:23:53,859 --> 00:23:56,027
It's a 45-minute surgery.

503
00:23:56,095 --> 00:23:58,029
It's a $10,000-surgery.

504
00:23:58,097 --> 00:24:00,665
And this hospital has a pro-bono budget.

505
00:24:00,733 --> 00:24:02,634
You are no longer
a doctor here, Stevens.

506
00:24:02,701 --> 00:24:05,136
And you have no right to come in here

507
00:24:05,204 --> 00:24:07,505
and commandeer a clinic,
a neurosurgeon and a resident.

508
00:24:07,573 --> 00:24:09,407
I gave you $8 million to build that clinic

509
00:24:09,475 --> 00:24:11,542
that you happily accepted at the time.

510
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:13,745
So I have no problem going to the board

511
00:24:13,812 --> 00:24:16,014
or the press if I have to

512
00:24:16,081 --> 00:24:19,384
to get Dr. Singer the surgery he needs.

513
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,254
Ahere'd you work with Jordan Hamlin?

514
00:24:23,322 --> 00:24:25,223
God. She's been at Stanford forever.

515
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:27,225
Yeah, Jordan Hamlin and I were bunkmates

516
00:24:27,293 --> 00:24:29,060
at camp Taka-Toka when we were 11.

517
00:24:29,128 --> 00:24:30,828
That girl can make a mean lanyard.

518
00:24:30,896 --> 00:24:33,364
You guys paged me. What going on?
Uh, this is Casey, age 8,

519
00:24:33,432 --> 00:24:35,500
asthmatic, uh, nebs at home
haven't been working.

520
00:24:35,567 --> 00:24:39,203
We added steroids, but he's
still having trouble breathing.
Casey, I'm Dr. Robbins.

521
00:24:39,271 --> 00:24:41,706
I'm gonna take a look at
your x-rays. You mind?

522
00:24:41,774 --> 00:24:44,175
No, go ahead.

523
00:24:44,243 --> 00:24:46,811
Hey, Casey. I'm just gonna take a listen.

524
00:24:55,688 --> 00:24:57,822
Dr. Altman, are you...

525
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:59,691
Trying to concentrate, Dr. Yang.

526
00:24:59,758 --> 00:25:02,360
Has Casey had any other medical issues?

527
00:25:02,428 --> 00:25:05,363
A febrile seizure at 3 months.

528
00:25:05,431 --> 00:25:08,199
Okay. Can you sit up for me?

529
00:25:08,267 --> 00:25:10,702
And did he scream a lot
when you brought him home

530
00:25:10,769 --> 00:25:12,570
from the hospital?
Yes.

531
00:25:12,638 --> 00:25:14,072
And has his asthma

532
00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:17,675
gotten better or worse as he's gotten older?
Worse.

533
00:25:17,743 --> 00:25:20,845
Okay. Thanks.

534
00:25:20,913 --> 00:25:22,347
Book an O.R.

535
00:25:22,414 --> 00:25:23,881
What? Why?

536
00:25:23,949 --> 00:25:26,217
Because I said so. But he has asthma.

537
00:25:26,285 --> 00:25:29,554
Cardiac asthma, Dr. Yang.
And you know that because?

538
00:25:29,621 --> 00:25:31,856
Because that seizure that
he had? It wasn't from a fever.

539
00:25:31,924 --> 00:25:34,759
He had a heart attack then
and he's having one now.

540
00:25:34,827 --> 00:25:36,262
So you're gonna book an O.R.
Because I'm your attending,

541
00:25:36,263 --> 00:25:38,763
and when I tell you to book
an O.R., book an O.R.

542
00:25:45,437 --> 00:25:47,305
I like her.

543
00:25:54,213 --> 00:25:56,280
I'm going to say a name,

544
00:25:56,348 --> 00:25:58,216
and then you are going to tell me

545
00:25:58,283 --> 00:26:01,452
you are not having an affair with her.

546
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,821
Izzie Stevens.

547
00:26:03,889 --> 00:26:05,156
What?

548
00:26:05,224 --> 00:26:08,025
What? That's why you ignored the D.N.R.

549
00:26:08,093 --> 00:26:09,994
That's why you fired her.

550
00:26:10,062 --> 00:26:11,963
That's why the two of you

551
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:14,465
were in your office
screaming at each other...

552
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:17,402
just... it is not funny, chief.

553
00:26:17,469 --> 00:26:19,837
That girl has cancer

554
00:26:19,905 --> 00:26:22,540
and a husband and...

555
00:26:22,608 --> 00:26:24,976
Okay. Yeah, I know, it's none of my business,

556
00:26:25,043 --> 00:26:27,178
but it's now affecting people's lives,

557
00:26:27,246 --> 00:26:29,046
patient's lives.

558
00:26:29,114 --> 00:26:31,115
What's this?

559
00:26:31,183 --> 00:26:32,917
It's the E.R.C.P. results

560
00:26:32,985 --> 00:26:34,852
of your emergency chole this morning.

561
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:38,055
It seems that you may have
accidentally clipped

562
00:26:38,123 --> 00:26:40,691
the common bile duct.

563
00:26:48,934 --> 00:26:50,401
How's the patient?

564
00:26:50,469 --> 00:26:52,870
Stable, for now.

565
00:26:52,938 --> 00:26:54,972
I told Grey and Adamson

566
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,442
to prep him for a repair,

567
00:26:57,509 --> 00:26:59,444
which I'm happy to do

568
00:26:59,511 --> 00:27:03,114
if you don't feel...

569
00:27:03,182 --> 00:27:06,384
Look, we caught it early enough that,

570
00:27:06,452 --> 00:27:08,453
if we can repair the duct,

571
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,622
there should be no long-term damage.

572
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:14,192
Good.

573
00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:17,094
No one knows about this, sir.

574
00:27:18,964 --> 00:27:21,766
And no one's going to know.

575
00:27:24,036 --> 00:27:28,172
But whatever it is that's distracting you...

576
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,910
whoever or whatever it is...

577
00:27:32,978 --> 00:27:36,781
I just hope you get a handle on it soon.

578
00:27:49,282 --> 00:27:51,116
The birds on your scrub cap are cute.

579
00:27:51,184 --> 00:27:53,452
Thank you.

580
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:56,421
Is he on full bypass?
Yes.

581
00:27:56,489 --> 00:27:58,590
See the anatomy here?

582
00:27:58,658 --> 00:28:00,092
The coronary artery

583
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,894
is attached to the pulmonary
artery not the aorta.

584
00:28:02,962 --> 00:28:05,931
It presented as asthma, but it's alcapa.
How did you know?

585
00:28:05,999 --> 00:28:08,100
I mean, you only listened to him

586
00:28:08,167 --> 00:28:11,536
and asked his mom a couple of questions.
I saw some cardiomegaly on his x-rays.

587
00:28:11,604 --> 00:28:13,939
And I heard a holosystolic
murmur through his wheezing.

588
00:28:14,007 --> 00:28:15,874
You'll know for next time.

589
00:28:15,942 --> 00:28:18,643
And after today, Dr. Yang,

590
00:28:18,711 --> 00:28:20,712
you'll know how to fix it.

591
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,748
Me? I...

592
00:28:22,815 --> 00:28:25,017
I thought you and Dr. Robbins were...

593
00:28:25,084 --> 00:28:27,519
Dr. Robbins, do you mind
if Dr. Yang first assists?

594
00:28:27,587 --> 00:28:29,621
Not at all.

595
00:28:29,689 --> 00:28:31,089
Uh...

596
00:28:39,499 --> 00:28:41,733
Maybe we'll both learn something today.

597
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:57,215
The guy Izzie brought in has N.P.H.

598
00:28:57,283 --> 00:28:58,717
Derek's operating now.

599
00:28:58,785 --> 00:29:01,653
I snuck her into the gallery
so she can watch.

600
00:29:01,721 --> 00:29:04,189
So if you want to go talk to her...

601
00:29:05,825 --> 00:29:07,159
Okay?

602
00:29:07,226 --> 00:29:09,461
Just explain her to me, okay?

603
00:29:09,529 --> 00:29:11,897
Because I don't get it. I don't get her.

604
00:29:11,964 --> 00:29:14,733
And I do? I'm like you.

605
00:29:14,801 --> 00:29:16,701
She's all bright and shiny,

606
00:29:16,769 --> 00:29:18,637
even after everything she's been through.

607
00:29:18,704 --> 00:29:21,239
I don't get it. But you're
the one who married her.

608
00:29:21,307 --> 00:29:24,409
So you're the one who has to figure it out.

609
00:29:24,477 --> 00:29:26,378
I can't solve everything.

610
00:29:26,446 --> 00:29:28,346
I lost the better part of my liver

611
00:29:28,414 --> 00:29:30,015
trying to solve everything.

612
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:33,952
If you want an explanation,
you have to go talk to Iz.

613
00:29:41,127 --> 00:29:44,830
Okay. Here we go. The moment of truth.

614
00:29:44,897 --> 00:29:47,499
Let's see Dr. Yang's handiwork.

615
00:29:54,407 --> 00:29:56,441
That's v-fib on the monitor.
Thank you for that update.

616
00:29:56,442 --> 00:29:58,310
All right,

617
00:29:58,377 --> 00:30:00,946
the bleeding's behind the coronary
artery anastomosis. My anastomosis.

618
00:30:01,013 --> 00:30:03,782
What did I do?
Right now it doesn't matter what
you did. What matters is,

619
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:07,018
what are you going to do to fix it?
Uh...

620
00:30:07,086 --> 00:30:10,789
Feel free to jump in here at anytime.
You can do this. Tell me what you want to do.

621
00:30:14,594 --> 00:30:16,394
I want to defibrillate.

622
00:30:16,462 --> 00:30:18,663
Then defibrillate.

623
00:30:18,731 --> 00:30:20,699
I'll unclamp.

624
00:30:23,302 --> 00:30:25,504
Okay, charge to 20.

625
00:30:25,571 --> 00:30:27,272
Clear.

626
00:30:30,743 --> 00:30:32,344
Nice.

627
00:30:32,411 --> 00:30:35,380
Now... I want you to keep
your eyes on the field

628
00:30:35,448 --> 00:30:37,883
and do exactly as I say.

629
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:41,253
We're gonna try to fix this
with rearresting the heart.

630
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,421
Are you with me?
Yes.

631
00:30:43,489 --> 00:30:46,391
Good. All right. You need to apply a suture

632
00:30:46,459 --> 00:30:49,261
proximally and distally.
Mm-hmm.

633
00:30:49,328 --> 00:30:52,531
Good. Dr. Avery, are you watching this?

634
00:30:52,598 --> 00:30:54,466
There will be a quiz afterward.

635
00:30:54,534 --> 00:30:57,602
Believe me, I'm watching.

636
00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:59,437
Good.

637
00:31:21,694 --> 00:31:23,995
So are you back or...

638
00:31:24,063 --> 00:31:26,431
Oh, did you want me to come back?

639
00:31:26,499 --> 00:31:27,933
Because you told the chief

640
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,569
you had serious doubts
about my abilities to be here.

641
00:31:30,636 --> 00:31:32,604
What?
You went behind my back

642
00:31:32,672 --> 00:31:35,006
and told the chief
I wasn't ready to be here.

643
00:31:35,074 --> 00:31:37,409
He was making cuts. I was protecting you.

644
00:31:37,476 --> 00:31:39,811
You got me fired, Alex.
Is that what you think?

645
00:31:39,879 --> 00:31:42,781
This job was the one thing I had left.

646
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:45,717
The one thing... and you took that away from me.

647
00:31:45,718 --> 00:31:47,686
You interfered and got me fired.

648
00:31:49,455 --> 00:31:51,523
I have forgiven you for a lot, Alex.

649
00:31:51,591 --> 00:31:53,992
I've had to forgive you for a lot.

650
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:57,162
But I cannot forgive you for this.

651
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:59,331
You made an assumption.

652
00:31:59,398 --> 00:32:01,700
You decided I did something.

653
00:32:01,767 --> 00:32:04,703
You didn't ask.

654
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:08,173
You didn't hang around to talk.

655
00:32:08,241 --> 00:32:10,141
I am your husband,

656
00:32:10,209 --> 00:32:13,144
and you didn't give me
the benefit of the doubt.

657
00:32:13,212 --> 00:32:15,947
So you know what?

658
00:32:16,015 --> 00:32:18,450
I can't forgive you either.

659
00:32:39,867 --> 00:32:42,669
Chief, you all right?

660
00:32:42,737 --> 00:32:44,104
You did the repair?

661
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:46,039
Yeah. No complications.

662
00:32:46,107 --> 00:32:49,075
We're hoping for a full recovery.

663
00:32:49,143 --> 00:32:51,778
And, uh, like I said... nobody knows.

664
00:32:57,451 --> 00:32:59,920
I'm not having an affair.

665
00:32:59,987 --> 00:33:02,856
Well, what is it, then?

666
00:33:02,924 --> 00:33:05,425
I... is it the merger?

667
00:33:05,493 --> 00:33:08,261
Is it Jennings and the board
or you and Shepherd?

668
00:33:08,329 --> 00:33:10,163
'Cause, well, your wife is right.

669
00:33:10,231 --> 00:33:12,632
There's something going on.

670
00:33:14,335 --> 00:33:16,670
I've decided to take
a step back from surgery

671
00:33:16,737 --> 00:33:18,138
for a while.

672
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:20,040
Now there's no reason for that.

673
00:33:20,107 --> 00:33:22,475
I've got enough on my plate as chief.

674
00:33:22,543 --> 00:33:25,579
And I can't afford another mistake.

675
00:33:27,481 --> 00:33:29,816
So I'd like you to take over my surgeries

676
00:33:29,884 --> 00:33:31,751
for the time being...
Chief...

677
00:33:31,819 --> 00:33:33,687
If you don't mind.

678
00:33:43,664 --> 00:33:45,465
How's the patient doing?

679
00:33:45,533 --> 00:33:47,400
Mm. Perfect.

680
00:33:47,468 --> 00:33:50,370
It's like someone
just switched the lights on.

681
00:33:50,438 --> 00:33:52,305
Dr. Shepherd said you did great.

682
00:33:52,373 --> 00:33:54,207
So we can get you home to Chehalis,

683
00:33:54,275 --> 00:33:56,209
get you out of that nursing home.

684
00:33:56,277 --> 00:33:59,179
I bet you could even go back
to teaching if you want.
Are you crazy?

685
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:02,182
I'm never going back to those
sex-crazed, teenage alcoholics.

686
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:04,117
No way.
Okay.

687
00:34:04,185 --> 00:34:06,753
What are you gonna do then?
I don't know.

688
00:34:06,821 --> 00:34:09,990
But... thanks to you, I have, uh,

689
00:34:10,057 --> 00:34:13,827
a few more mental faculties
to figure it out with.

690
00:34:13,894 --> 00:34:16,496
How about you?

691
00:34:16,564 --> 00:34:19,466
I don't know yet either.

692
00:34:22,937 --> 00:34:26,106
You're still my best student.

693
00:34:27,642 --> 00:34:29,709
Let's get you home.

694
00:34:32,413 --> 00:34:33,813
Guess what I did today.

695
00:34:33,881 --> 00:34:36,049
Well, whatever it was, it had to be better

696
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:39,152
than getting your surgeries
stolen by Mercy West residents.

697
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:42,389
It was. I did a takeuchi repair.

698
00:34:42,456 --> 00:34:45,191
You did not.

699
00:34:45,259 --> 00:34:46,693
Uh, not all by myself,

700
00:34:46,761 --> 00:34:49,863
but Altman did let me do the
coronary artery anastomosis.

701
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:52,599
Wow. Maybe she is a cardio God.

702
00:34:52,667 --> 00:34:54,367
Yeah, I know.

703
00:35:00,975 --> 00:35:03,977
Here are tomorrow's surgeries.

704
00:35:04,045 --> 00:35:06,479
We can go over them in the morning.

705
00:35:11,652 --> 00:35:13,687
What, uh, what's going on?

706
00:35:13,754 --> 00:35:15,722
Uh, the chief's taking some time off

707
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:18,692
from surgery for a while.
Because he's having an affair?

708
00:35:18,759 --> 00:35:20,293
Because of the merger.

709
00:35:20,361 --> 00:35:22,228
He's not having an affair.

710
00:35:22,296 --> 00:35:23,730
He's exhausted.

711
00:35:23,798 --> 00:35:28,234
Now I've lost my work-husband
and my husband-husband.

712
00:35:28,302 --> 00:35:30,537
So I'll be your work-husband.
You already have Sloan.

713
00:35:30,604 --> 00:35:33,039
Oh, yeah, that's true.
Oh, what about Shepherd?

714
00:35:33,107 --> 00:35:35,041
Are you kidding? With all that hair?

715
00:35:35,109 --> 00:35:37,477
I can't be looking at that all day.

716
00:35:44,185 --> 00:35:45,185
Hey.

717
00:35:45,252 --> 00:35:47,420
Hey.

718
00:35:48,889 --> 00:35:49,889
So...

719
00:35:49,957 --> 00:35:51,458
Mm-hmm.

720
00:35:51,525 --> 00:35:52,892
Cristina Yang.

721
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,095
Yeah. I...

722
00:35:55,162 --> 00:35:56,830
I probably should've told you.

723
00:35:56,897 --> 00:35:58,765
But I... I just didn't want to bias you.

724
00:35:58,833 --> 00:36:02,202
You know, I didn't want you
to favor her for me. I...

725
00:36:02,269 --> 00:36:05,505
I just wanted her to stand on her own talent.

726
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:11,311
When'd you break up, uh, with Beth?

727
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:14,214
Um... Well, I...

728
00:36:14,281 --> 00:36:16,549
I don't know. That was a while back.

729
00:36:21,155 --> 00:36:23,523
I thought you would call me.

730
00:36:26,794 --> 00:36:28,762
Oh, God.

731
00:36:28,829 --> 00:36:30,196
Wh...

732
00:36:30,264 --> 00:36:33,299
I... I guess it really was all in my head.

733
00:36:33,367 --> 00:36:34,801
Oh, my God.

734
00:36:34,869 --> 00:36:36,703
What? What was in your head?

735
00:36:36,771 --> 00:36:38,671
Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. I just...

736
00:36:38,739 --> 00:36:42,308
I... I... I always thought that
if you and Beth ever broke up,

737
00:36:42,376 --> 00:36:43,843
that I... I...

738
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:46,846
I just... I thought that you would call me.

739
00:36:52,486 --> 00:36:53,787
Teddy...

740
00:36:53,854 --> 00:36:56,089
It's okay, Owen.

741
00:36:56,157 --> 00:36:57,824
It's okay.

742
00:36:57,892 --> 00:36:59,692
I clearly...

743
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,594
Made up this whole story.

744
00:37:01,662 --> 00:37:04,531
I mean, it was... it was a good story.

745
00:37:04,598 --> 00:37:06,966
It was all tortured and...

746
00:37:07,034 --> 00:37:09,803
"bridges of Dison County," and I...

747
00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:16,509
It's all right.

748
00:37:16,577 --> 00:37:18,611
I, uh, now I know,

749
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:22,482
and... I can, um...

750
00:37:24,485 --> 00:37:27,687
I can let that story go.

751
00:37:31,225 --> 00:37:33,359
Good night.

752
00:37:46,807 --> 00:37:48,842
Hey.

753
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:53,046
Mwah!

754
00:37:53,113 --> 00:37:55,915
Thank you for my present.

755
00:37:57,885 --> 00:38:02,522
And I'll try to get over
the birds on the scrub cap.

756
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:04,490
You know, Teddy's best friend, she...

757
00:38:04,558 --> 00:38:06,960
she was a bird person. She loved birds.

758
00:38:07,027 --> 00:38:08,394
Yeah?

759
00:38:08,462 --> 00:38:10,964
And, um...

760
00:38:11,031 --> 00:38:13,733
well, she died in the second tower.

761
00:38:15,903 --> 00:38:17,770
And that's why Teddy gave up

762
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:20,340
her attending position at Xolumbia,

763
00:38:20,407 --> 00:38:22,709
and she joined the army.

764
00:38:24,778 --> 00:38:28,715
I told you she'd... surprise you.

765
00:38:30,284 --> 00:38:32,185
Thank you.

766
00:38:32,253 --> 00:38:36,656
Sometimes the past is something
you just can't let go of.

767
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:46,199
I think she'll be back.

768
00:38:46,267 --> 00:38:48,201
And sometimes the past is something

769
00:38:48,269 --> 00:38:51,371
we'll do anything to forget.

770
00:38:53,574 --> 00:38:56,209
You want to keep drinking?

771
00:39:04,718 --> 00:39:06,519
Another club soda, Joe.

772
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:12,292
Are you goin' home after this
or back to the hospital?

773
00:39:14,094 --> 00:39:17,130
Another club soda, then home.

774
00:39:18,799 --> 00:39:21,134
I'm gonna need your keys.

775
00:39:41,155 --> 00:39:43,523
I'll call you a cab when you're ready.

776
00:39:47,661 --> 00:39:49,595
Richard's not talking to me.

777
00:39:49,663 --> 00:39:52,098
What? Why?
I don't know.  He's just not himself.

778
00:39:52,166 --> 00:39:55,368
You been drunk for a few days.
I was drunk for years.
Wat happened to you?

779
00:39:55,436 --> 00:39:57,370
Excuse me?
There was a time you would've
convinced me to do this surgery,

780
00:39:57,438 --> 00:39:59,305
but now your first instinct is no.

781
00:39:59,373 --> 00:40:01,374
What happened to you?

782
00:40:01,442 --> 00:40:03,443
For every miscalculation
you think you see,

783
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,478
there have been a hundred things

784
00:40:05,546 --> 00:40:07,613
that I have gotten right,
and no one knows.

785
00:40:07,681 --> 00:40:10,550
There's no one who understands
and cares more

786
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:12,819
about Seattle Grace than...

787
00:40:12,886 --> 00:40:14,854
I'm still the chief of surgery at this hospital!
Then start acting like it.

788
00:40:14,922 --> 00:40:17,156
You have a disease, Thatcher.

789
00:40:17,224 --> 00:40:20,893
When you're in it, you can't stop.
That has been the system

790
00:40:20,961 --> 00:40:23,863
that has been in place since this merger...

791
00:40:23,931 --> 00:40:26,966
Your system.
You're fired. Immediately.

792
00:40:27,034 --> 00:40:29,469
Get the hell outta my hospital.

793
00:40:29,536 --> 00:40:31,437
Please don't do this to me.

794
00:40:31,505 --> 00:40:34,407
I don't have anything left. Please.

795
00:40:34,475 --> 00:40:37,210
It seems that you may have

796
00:40:37,277 --> 00:40:40,446
accidentally clipped the common bile duct.

797
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:58,297
And sometimes

798
00:40:58,365 --> 00:41:00,767
we learn something new about the past...

799
00:41:02,336 --> 00:41:05,204
that changes everything we know...

800
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:12,612
about the present.
