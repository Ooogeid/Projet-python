1
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:07,070
<i>Great surgeons aren't made,
they're born.</i>

2
00:00:07,408 --> 00:00:08,845
<i>It takes gestation,</i>

3
00:00:09,136 --> 00:00:11,279
<i>incubation, sacrifice.</i>

4
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:13,057
<i>A lot of sacrifice.</i>

5
00:00:13,434 --> 00:00:16,576
<i>But after all the blood and guts
and gooey stuff is washed away...</i>

6
00:00:16,738 --> 00:00:19,360
<i>That surgeon you become?
Totally worth it.</i>

7
00:00:19,492 --> 00:00:20,940
Welcome back.

8
00:00:23,184 --> 00:00:25,946
I am not back.
I am here for a surgery.

9
00:00:26,446 --> 00:00:27,530
I know.

10
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,956
Uh, chart, labs,
security key card

11
00:00:31,076 --> 00:00:32,636
and key to the doctors' lounge.

12
00:00:32,756 --> 00:00:35,526
Oh, look.
These are my old picture.

13
00:00:36,445 --> 00:00:39,084
- It's like I never left.
- Addie, you're back.

14
00:00:39,347 --> 00:00:41,591
- I am not back.
- Oh, you're back.

15
00:00:41,883 --> 00:00:44,223
You're gonna smell the stink
and sweat of surgery,

16
00:00:44,343 --> 00:00:45,911
and you're gonna be back.

17
00:00:46,193 --> 00:00:48,181
See? Nothing ever
changes around here.

18
00:00:48,301 --> 00:00:49,469
Things change.

19
00:00:49,629 --> 00:00:52,133
- Welcome back.
- I am not back!

20
00:00:53,573 --> 00:00:56,148
Well, I just had no idea
that sunrise yoga

21
00:00:56,268 --> 00:00:57,941
- would be so intense.
- Told ya.

22
00:00:58,061 --> 00:01:00,555
Um, Dr. Hahn,
I have the 3-d ultrasounds

23
00:01:00,675 --> 00:01:02,621
and the fetal MRI's
for today's patient.

24
00:01:02,741 --> 00:01:05,523
Have you decided who's gonna scrub in?
Because I diagnosed the mother

25
00:01:05,643 --> 00:01:07,862
- when she came into the clinic, so...
- Films.

26
00:01:16,995 --> 00:01:20,364
My first day. My clinical trial.
My baby, all grown up.

27
00:01:20,484 --> 00:01:22,286
Nobody cares
about your clinical trial

28
00:01:22,406 --> 00:01:25,380
or your sick sick, terminal patients,
who'd probably rather be left for dead.

29
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:26,945
- You're just jealous.
- Yeah.

30
00:01:27,065 --> 00:01:30,093
Anyone can come up with a clinical trial
I could come up with a clinical trial.

31
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,843
- Jealous.
- Not that it would matter,

32
00:01:31,963 --> 00:01:34,639
'cause Hahn wouldn't sign off on it.
You know she won't even talk to me?

33
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,975
- She always enjoyed talking to me.
- Really, about what?

34
00:01:37,135 --> 00:01:40,065
Her hopes, her dreams,
then we would braid each other's hair.

35
00:01:40,185 --> 00:01:42,480
- At least I'm not living in the clinic.
- I like the clinic.

36
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,573
- The clinic is my happy place.
- Can you use

37
00:01:44,693 --> 00:01:47,235
your sparkle pager
to get me in on Hahn's surgery today?

38
00:01:47,395 --> 00:01:51,072
I can even think about the sparkle pager
because my clinical trial starts today.

39
00:01:51,232 --> 00:01:53,178
- Sparkle pager stealer!
- Thank you.

40
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,990
Okay, the both of you
need to just take a moment

41
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:59,175
and dig down deep, and you'll discover
when you do you're truly happy for me

42
00:01:59,295 --> 00:02:01,624
that I have found my path
to medical history.

43
00:02:03,202 --> 00:02:05,174
- I'm not happy for her.
- Me neither.

44
00:02:05,294 --> 00:02:06,889
His karnofsky score is still 80,

45
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:09,057
and his CBC
and liver enzymes are good.

46
00:02:09,177 --> 00:02:10,890
- That's better than expected.
- I know.

47
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:12,975
Better doesn't mean good.
I don't want you getting

48
00:02:13,095 --> 00:02:15,556
emotionally involved with these
patients and getting your hopes up.

49
00:02:15,676 --> 00:02:18,433
- My hopes are not up.
- All right, then, Dr. Grey,

50
00:02:18,593 --> 00:02:20,477
- let's do this. Good.
- Okay.

51
00:02:20,637 --> 00:02:21,766
Chart please.

52
00:02:29,047 --> 00:02:30,277
Come here, you.

53
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,825
Wow, it's, uh...
It's great to see you guys.

54
00:02:35,985 --> 00:02:38,078
- How's L.A?
- Oh, it's great. It's fun.

55
00:02:38,238 --> 00:02:40,663
You know,
it's the sun and the surfing.

56
00:02:40,823 --> 00:02:42,040
You surf?

57
00:02:42,966 --> 00:02:44,334
No, I don't surf, but...

58
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:47,670
So anyway, look, I hugged you there.
Did you see that I hugged you?

59
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,673
You stole my husband from me,
I hugged you. I've grown.

60
00:02:51,382 --> 00:02:55,136
I have, and I can be happy
for the happy couple.

61
00:02:55,485 --> 00:02:57,606
Right? I'm all L.A and like...

62
00:02:57,726 --> 00:03:00,017
One with myself.
So I feel really...

63
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:06,335
Okay, well,
I'm gonna go save a life now.

64
00:03:07,602 --> 00:03:09,776
Really, great...
Great to see you, really.

65
00:03:10,088 --> 00:03:11,110
Cheers.

66
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,571
- Happy couple?
- See you after rounds.

67
00:03:17,754 --> 00:03:19,068
There she is.

68
00:03:19,735 --> 00:03:22,283
Just coming in to check
on my patient's skin flap.

69
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:23,705
Well, amazing, right?

70
00:03:24,475 --> 00:03:26,960
I pulled a couple of stem cells
from the baby in utero.

71
00:03:27,213 --> 00:03:29,212
Six weeks later,
I have grown skin,

72
00:03:29,836 --> 00:03:30,915
like God.

73
00:03:31,457 --> 00:03:32,340
Nice.

74
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,510
What do you say we lock that door
and tear one off for old time's sake?

75
00:03:35,684 --> 00:03:37,565
This place is exactly the same.

76
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:40,229
You are exactly the same.

77
00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:43,685
Except now I grow skin
for babies... Like God.

78
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,646
Come on. I'm horny.
The nurses have shut me down.

79
00:03:48,071 --> 00:03:49,732
Thanks for my skin flap.

80
00:03:50,526 --> 00:03:52,348
- That a euphemism?
- Nope.

81
00:03:54,212 --> 00:03:55,543
I am so coding.

82
00:03:55,663 --> 00:03:57,890
- Coding hard.
- What is that? Is that complaining?

83
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:59,986
'Cause if you're gonna complain,
do it to my face.

84
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:01,674
There's nothing to do down here.

85
00:04:01,794 --> 00:04:03,955
Can we please
go to the pit or something?

86
00:04:04,236 --> 00:04:06,630
You're down here
to learn patient care

87
00:04:06,837 --> 00:04:08,750
bedside manner
and a whole host of things

88
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,421
you cannot learn in the pit,
so suck it up.

89
00:04:12,845 --> 00:04:15,942
Hi. Dr. Stevens. What seems
to be your problem today?

90
00:04:16,062 --> 00:04:17,123
We, um...

91
00:04:17,537 --> 00:04:19,470
My wife thinks
she may be pregnant.

92
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,098
- Okay, we'll get you a test...
- Code...

93
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,241
Excuse me, won't you?

94
00:04:26,857 --> 00:04:28,313
What is wrong with you people?

95
00:04:28,473 --> 00:04:30,434
And what is that smell?
Is that...

96
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,319
- Is that scotch?
- It's seeping out of Leo's pores.

97
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,821
You're hungover?
You're all hungover?

98
00:04:36,981 --> 00:04:38,807
- Don't blame us. Blame O'Malley.
- George?

99
00:04:38,927 --> 00:04:41,534
- He and Lexie Grey had a party.
- George had a party?

100
00:04:44,965 --> 00:04:47,906
Okay, people, you're about
to experience medical history,

101
00:04:48,026 --> 00:04:50,209
medical greatness,
medical majesty.

102
00:04:50,369 --> 00:04:53,364
You're about to experience the beginning
of something extraordinary.

103
00:04:53,825 --> 00:04:55,465
Take in the moment.

104
00:04:57,516 --> 00:05:00,219
Dr. Grey, did you warn the interns
on what to expect?

105
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:03,806
- I told them to expect greatness.
- Yes, in addition to all the greatness,

106
00:05:03,966 --> 00:05:05,968
the patient may be
inappropriately emotional,

107
00:05:06,088 --> 00:05:07,711
which means he's aggressive.

108
00:05:07,936 --> 00:05:09,562
Abusive.
Don't take it personally.

109
00:05:09,722 --> 00:05:12,353
Don't engage. Just realize
it's the tumor talking, okay?

110
00:05:13,558 --> 00:05:16,409
Mr. Robinson, Mrs. Robinson,
Dr. Grey and I want to say once again

111
00:05:16,529 --> 00:05:19,498
how grateful we are that you've decided
to participate in our clinical trial.

112
00:05:19,618 --> 00:05:21,432
I know it's a very hard
decision to make.

113
00:05:21,552 --> 00:05:22,867
But it is a chance, right?

114
00:05:23,027 --> 00:05:24,536
It's, like, our only chance?

115
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:28,144
Well, if the surgery doesn't kill me,
the tumor will.

116
00:05:28,638 --> 00:05:30,500
What have I got to lose, right?

117
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,037
As we discussed, the treatment
has never been tested on humans before.

118
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:36,659
We're going to inject
a live virus into the tumor.

119
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:39,342
Since we can't we take the tumor out,
our hope is to reduce

120
00:05:39,502 --> 00:05:41,207
- the tumor from within.
- Dr. O'Malley.

121
00:05:41,327 --> 00:05:44,931
Over the past month, Mr. Robinson
has experienced worsening vision loss

122
00:05:45,091 --> 00:05:47,558
and increasingly severe headaches.
That in c...

123
00:05:49,911 --> 00:05:50,937
Nice, huh?

124
00:05:51,274 --> 00:05:53,378
First thing I noticed about her...
Hell of an ass.

125
00:05:53,498 --> 00:05:56,352
You like a nice piece of ass? Admittedly
she could do with a little more on top.

126
00:05:56,472 --> 00:05:58,753
He's also started picking out
new husbands for me.

127
00:05:58,873 --> 00:06:00,487
Was anyone talking to you?!

128
00:06:03,834 --> 00:06:05,139
It's the tumor talking.

129
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,361
Yeah, it's just the tumor talking.

130
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:13,710
So you're single or what?

131
00:06:16,238 --> 00:06:17,487
Dr. Montgomery.

132
00:06:17,929 --> 00:06:19,632
- Dr. Karev.
- Hey.

133
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,929
- We're hugging?
- Yep. I hug now.

134
00:06:25,837 --> 00:06:28,266
It's what I do, so...
So you're my guy, huh?

135
00:06:28,645 --> 00:06:31,443
You think I'd let anyone else
in on a case like this?

136
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,570
Uh, I'll catch up with you
in a second.

137
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:36,857
Okay.

138
00:06:42,299 --> 00:06:44,271
You, uh, you don't own a phone?

139
00:06:44,828 --> 00:06:47,201
I need to see you in person.

140
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:51,520
I have a really huge case today. I wish
I could hang out, I really do, but I...

141
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,879
I'm pregnant.

142
00:06:55,395 --> 00:06:57,042
Uh... Didn't mean to blurt it.

143
00:06:57,162 --> 00:06:58,916
I'm sorry I blurted it, but I c...

144
00:06:59,363 --> 00:07:02,725
You never have time to talk,
so I kinda had no choice but to blurt.

145
00:07:04,022 --> 00:07:06,387
Are you keeping it
or are you having an abortion?

146
00:07:09,397 --> 00:07:10,843
I have a really big case.

00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:22,862
Ectopia cordis...

149
00:07:23,206 --> 00:07:25,782
The baby's heart is growing
outside of its body in utero.

150
00:07:25,942 --> 00:07:28,066
Less than 200 cases
have ever been reported.

151
00:07:28,207 --> 00:07:29,580
Only a handful have survived.

152
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,501
I was on one of these cases
10 years ago.

153
00:07:31,621 --> 00:07:34,572
The baby squeezed its own heart
in utero and died.

154
00:07:34,694 --> 00:07:37,398
He squeezed his own heart
with his tiny, little hands?

155
00:07:37,518 --> 00:07:40,479
Richard, you said there's a possibility
of a diaphragmatic hernia?

156
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:41,660
Yeah.

157
00:07:45,576 --> 00:07:48,387
You and I have got a lot of work
to do on this little guy.

158
00:07:48,547 --> 00:07:50,226
- You up for it?
- Always.

159
00:07:50,346 --> 00:07:52,558
What about my work?
I grew an amazin flap

160
00:07:52,718 --> 00:07:54,769
of the baby's own skin,
pretend all you want,

161
00:07:54,929 --> 00:07:56,639
but I know you're impressed.

162
00:08:00,223 --> 00:08:01,946
You are going to...

163
00:08:02,853 --> 00:08:04,445
- What's up, bro'Malley?
- You....

164
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:06,381
O'Malley's in the house.

165
00:08:08,157 --> 00:08:09,401
Hey, you paged me?

166
00:08:11,322 --> 00:08:13,871
O'Malley, 'sup, party dude?

167
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,625
Want to know what I did last night?
I googled recipes.

168
00:08:17,785 --> 00:08:19,628
I spent the night with a search engine.

169
00:08:19,825 --> 00:08:23,397
Oh, but that was just...
It was so spontaneous.

170
00:08:24,792 --> 00:08:26,545
Think you'd want to hang out
with interns.

171
00:08:26,665 --> 00:08:27,927
- Code.
- Code.

172
00:08:28,838 --> 00:08:30,853
- What is that?
- It's just something we came...

173
00:08:31,064 --> 00:08:32,431
Well, he came up with.

174
00:08:32,598 --> 00:08:33,474
He coded.

175
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,686
- You coded.
- Coded.

176
00:08:36,846 --> 00:08:39,788
- It was really funny after 7 or 8 shot.
- You coded.

177
00:08:39,988 --> 00:08:41,774
Hey. So we're all set for tonight.

178
00:08:41,934 --> 00:08:43,484
Tonight? What's tonight?

179
00:08:46,063 --> 00:08:47,238
The interns, we're...

180
00:08:47,398 --> 00:08:50,486
We're just having a little
darts tournament thing at Joe's.

181
00:08:50,606 --> 00:08:52,577
- Oh, my god. I love darts.
- Do you wanna...

182
00:08:52,737 --> 00:08:55,288
- Do you wanna come?
- Yeah, absolutely. Yay.

183
00:08:59,362 --> 00:09:00,554
Ya so coded.

184
00:09:03,792 --> 00:09:07,008
You know, I thought, I don't know,
that it would be weird coming back,

185
00:09:07,168 --> 00:09:10,749
but I gotta say,
I find it strangely comforting

186
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,049
that everything is the same here.

187
00:09:14,856 --> 00:09:17,185
Okay, in L.A, people say things,

188
00:09:17,551 --> 00:09:20,566
but in Seattle, there's this strange
culture of wordlessness

189
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:22,440
where in I am supposed to suss

190
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,109
what one is feeling
by the slight

191
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:28,546
raise of an eyebrow
or the beginnings of a frown.

192
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:30,767
There any chance
you want to tell me

193
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,201
what's going on with you, Miranda?

194
00:09:34,224 --> 00:09:36,704
Just a lot has changed since you left.

195
00:09:36,864 --> 00:09:38,168
- Just a lot.
- Come on.

196
00:09:38,288 --> 00:09:40,666
Name one thing that has
changed in this hospital.

197
00:09:41,018 --> 00:09:43,127
The clinic is actually
making money.

198
00:09:43,287 --> 00:09:44,921
The chief's wife left him.

199
00:09:45,287 --> 00:09:48,382
Derek and Meredith
broke up and I...

200
00:09:49,681 --> 00:09:51,626
Derek and Meredith broke up?

201
00:09:52,283 --> 00:09:54,847
Like I said,
a lot of things have changed.

202
00:09:57,468 --> 00:10:00,240
Nikki Jones, 25-year-old female,
35 weeks pregnant.

203
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,140
Six weeks ago, she was diagnosed
with ectopia cordis.

204
00:10:03,347 --> 00:10:05,654
Which, as you know,
means that your baby's heart

205
00:10:05,774 --> 00:10:08,487
is currently growing on
the outside of his body.

206
00:10:08,678 --> 00:10:11,443
Which doesn't get any less bizarre
the more times I hear it.

207
00:10:11,704 --> 00:10:14,174
Not bizarre, baby.
Just unique.

208
00:10:15,056 --> 00:10:16,642
Our son is one of a kind...

209
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,755
Wearing his heart on his sleeve.

210
00:10:19,564 --> 00:10:22,333
This surgery is going to
take place in two OR's.

211
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:24,585
It will work like a dance.

212
00:10:24,705 --> 00:10:26,529
Dr Karev and I will begin
with the delivery.

213
00:10:26,649 --> 00:10:28,792
And I'll stay behind
to close your incision, Nikki.

214
00:10:28,912 --> 00:10:30,371
While I bring your baby to OR 2.

215
00:10:30,491 --> 00:10:32,220
Where I'll work on your baby's heart.

216
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,185
And I'll attend to
your baby's intestinal problem.

217
00:10:35,921 --> 00:10:38,641
- What intestinal problem?
- We've detected there might be

218
00:10:38,801 --> 00:10:41,574
a slight defect
on your baby's diaphragm.

219
00:10:41,705 --> 00:10:44,184
We just want to be prepared
for every contingency.

220
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,207
I just wish
I could keep him inside me,

221
00:10:47,573 --> 00:10:50,236
- keep him protected.
- He's protected no matter what,

222
00:10:50,923 --> 00:10:52,071
by us,

223
00:10:52,372 --> 00:10:53,564
by our love.

224
00:10:56,434 --> 00:10:58,896
Something about that guy makes
me just want to punch him out.

225
00:10:59,016 --> 00:11:01,739
And yet you didn't,
for which I am grateful, Karev.

226
00:11:03,927 --> 00:11:05,835
Hippies... annoying.

227
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:08,629
Go away.

228
00:11:11,523 --> 00:11:14,135
- Hey. How great is she?
- She's great.

229
00:11:14,295 --> 00:11:15,904
- Did I tell you?
- You told me.

230
00:11:16,024 --> 00:11:17,763
- Did she tell you?
- Tell me what?

231
00:11:17,923 --> 00:11:19,172
Anything, everything.

232
00:11:19,292 --> 00:11:21,264
Does she know you're divorced?

233
00:11:22,136 --> 00:11:23,153
You're divorced?

234
00:11:23,273 --> 00:11:24,750
Which, as it turns out...

235
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:27,170
Was the best thing
that could've happened, really.

236
00:11:27,903 --> 00:11:28,928
No kidding?

237
00:11:29,048 --> 00:11:31,574
- Are you headed...
- All right, I'll walk with you.

238
00:11:37,767 --> 00:11:39,683
So it seems like
there's been a lot of change,

239
00:11:39,803 --> 00:11:41,378
even since the last checkup.

240
00:11:41,498 --> 00:11:43,490
His behavior's been getting
more erratic?

241
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,249
That's a nice way of putting it.

242
00:11:45,409 --> 00:11:47,126
Well, you've been incredibly strong.

243
00:11:47,286 --> 00:11:49,712
This is...
You've been incredibly strong.

244
00:11:52,715 --> 00:11:54,344
If you really want to help, Dr. Grey,

245
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,093
you could bring
some single men by.

246
00:11:56,358 --> 00:11:57,386
Phillip...

247
00:11:58,774 --> 00:11:59,638
Please stop.

248
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:03,265
Jennifer, we're in a hospital
full of eligible doctors,

249
00:12:03,385 --> 00:12:05,258
and you're a waitress
with no prospects

250
00:12:05,378 --> 00:12:07,702
who needs to learn how to use
her ass to catch a new guy

251
00:12:07,822 --> 00:12:09,503
before I bite the dust!

252
00:12:12,721 --> 00:12:14,420
It's just the tumor talking.

253
00:12:16,176 --> 00:12:17,657
It's just the tumor talking.

254
00:12:17,817 --> 00:12:18,848
It is.

255
00:12:18,968 --> 00:12:20,596
It's just the tumor talking.

256
00:12:25,608 --> 00:12:27,166
And he's laughing again,

257
00:12:27,316 --> 00:12:30,704
because the idea of me with
another man is just hilarious.

258
00:12:31,671 --> 00:12:34,056
No, no, it's not.
I just can't see.

259
00:12:34,214 --> 00:12:36,258
- What? What can't you see?
- Anything.

260
00:12:39,031 --> 00:12:40,096
I'm blind.

261
00:12:50,349 --> 00:12:51,565
No response to light.

262
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,486
If I remember correctly,
you're a good-looking guy, right?

263
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,908
Just 'cause I'm blind doesn't mean

264
00:13:00,028 --> 00:13:02,460
you can ignore me,
you sick, twisted bastard!

265
00:13:02,945 --> 00:13:06,005
Playing games with people's lives,
slicing open people's brains...

266
00:13:08,465 --> 00:13:09,959
Mr. Robinson, I'm...

267
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,342
I'm sorry, but I believe
it's possible the tumor

268
00:13:13,462 --> 00:13:15,005
is infiltrating the optic nerve.

269
00:13:15,736 --> 00:13:17,924
We should consider
moving the surgery,

270
00:13:18,065 --> 00:13:19,385
maybe even doing it today.

271
00:13:23,325 --> 00:13:25,034
What about you, Dr. Grey?

272
00:13:25,715 --> 00:13:27,226
You're a sexy little thing.

273
00:13:27,622 --> 00:13:29,284
You think, Dr. Shepherd here

274
00:13:29,404 --> 00:13:31,259
is attractive enough for my wife?

275
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,908
Jennifer...
This isn't easy, I know.

276
00:13:43,611 --> 00:13:45,874
My husband is probably
gonna die today.

277
00:13:46,447 --> 00:13:48,973
We're moving up the surgery,
and he might die,

278
00:13:49,123 --> 00:13:52,184
and all he can do is try
to fix me up with other men.

279
00:13:52,442 --> 00:13:56,338
And I know, I know
it's the tumor talking, but if he dies,

280
00:13:56,498 --> 00:14:00,009
my last memory is going to be
of him calling me a piece of ass.

281
00:14:05,048 --> 00:14:07,308
I'm not involv ed
and my hopes are not up.

282
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:13,072
I'm having trouble finding
a heartbeat on an ultrasound.

283
00:14:13,192 --> 00:14:16,137
That's what happens, Dr. Guzman,
when you've had scotch for dinner.

284
00:14:16,257 --> 00:14:18,407
It's hard to follow the basics.

285
00:14:21,514 --> 00:14:22,782
Oh, Rebecca.

286
00:14:23,664 --> 00:14:25,499
I really didn't want an ultrasound.

287
00:14:25,619 --> 00:14:28,996
I just wanted to get something
for the morning sickness.

288
00:14:29,175 --> 00:14:30,831
It's really bad.

289
00:14:30,991 --> 00:14:32,077
So you're pregnant?

290
00:14:32,197 --> 00:14:34,502
Yeah. Just like five weeks or so.

291
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:37,880
Yeah, an ultrasound can be pretty hard
to read this early on, so...

292
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,591
Let's just take a blood sample,
and make sure everything's on track.

293
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:42,055
Okay.

294
00:14:42,384 --> 00:14:43,385
Dr. Stevens...

295
00:14:43,545 --> 00:14:45,788
Do you know when Dr. Karev
will be out of surgery?

296
00:14:45,908 --> 00:14:47,215
I just wanted to say hi.

297
00:14:47,335 --> 00:14:50,068
Um, I don't know
that he's gone in yet.

298
00:14:52,513 --> 00:14:55,450
You broke up with Meredith Grey?

299
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:58,104
We're doing a clinical trial together
if that makes you feel better.

300
00:14:58,224 --> 00:15:00,291
Derek, I hugged her...
Hugged her.

301
00:15:00,411 --> 00:15:03,697
And you're not even together anymore?
What the hell happened?

302
00:15:04,843 --> 00:15:07,201
Okay, fine.
Tell me about the clinical trial.

303
00:15:07,618 --> 00:15:10,735
Well, if it doesn't go well,
I'm killing people for sport.

304
00:15:11,794 --> 00:15:13,532
When I walk into an OR,
I'm an expert.

305
00:15:13,652 --> 00:15:16,126
I can stop a bleed,
I can remove a clot. I'm the expert.

306
00:15:16,497 --> 00:15:18,046
But in a clinical trial...

307
00:15:19,004 --> 00:15:20,076
I'm experimenting,

308
00:15:20,196 --> 00:15:22,716
just groping around in the dark,

309
00:15:22,876 --> 00:15:24,677
hoping to do the right thing.

310
00:15:25,131 --> 00:15:26,830
She wants greatness from me.

311
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,313
She's expecting greatness.

312
00:15:29,433 --> 00:15:30,902
Okay, seriously...

313
00:15:31,236 --> 00:15:33,018
Derek, what are you doing?

314
00:15:34,764 --> 00:15:36,220
I'm seeing somebody else.

315
00:15:37,765 --> 00:15:38,772
She's lovely.

316
00:15:40,449 --> 00:15:41,694
She's really lovely.

317
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,256
Hey. You came.

318
00:15:46,376 --> 00:15:49,410
Yeah. You have to stop paging me.
I can't deal with this right now.

319
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:52,253
- I have a really big case today...
- I am just as scared and confused

320
00:15:52,373 --> 00:15:54,582
- about this as you are.
- I'm not scared. I'm just...

321
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:58,002
Look,
you don't want me, okay?

322
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,546
This is not a thing you want me for.

323
00:16:00,706 --> 00:16:03,542
I won't be good at it.
I'm not father material.

324
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,914
I mean... You have a husband.

325
00:16:06,034 --> 00:16:07,922
He doesn't have to know
that it's mine, okay?

326
00:16:08,042 --> 00:16:10,139
No, it's not okay, Alex.

327
00:16:10,299 --> 00:16:13,846
I'm just asking you to get
over yourself for one minute

328
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,812
and talk to me
so we can figure this thing out...

329
00:16:17,147 --> 00:16:18,180
Together.

330
00:16:20,091 --> 00:16:21,199
I have to go.

331
00:16:27,065 --> 00:16:29,681
I'm gonna be making the incision
from here to here, and...

332
00:16:29,801 --> 00:16:31,452
Excuse me.
What you said before

333
00:16:31,612 --> 00:16:33,192
about further complications...

334
00:16:33,312 --> 00:16:34,957
No, we can't think like that.

335
00:16:35,398 --> 00:16:36,992
There's nothing else
wrong with him.

336
00:16:37,112 --> 00:16:39,029
Our intention is to have
a healthy baby.

337
00:16:39,149 --> 00:16:41,462
He'll be strong and happy
and healthy.

338
00:16:41,622 --> 00:16:43,910
Don't you understand
what we're trying to tell you?

339
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,935
Chances are your baby's gonna need hell
of a lot more than just heart surgery.

340
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:51,545
- Chances are he won't.
- You can't cross your fingers or close

341
00:16:51,665 --> 00:16:53,947
your eyes
and hope this will all go away.

342
00:16:56,142 --> 00:16:58,437
He's not prepared.
I was trying to prepare him.

343
00:16:58,597 --> 00:17:01,607
They're having a baby, and that
baby is gonna be all screwed up

344
00:17:01,767 --> 00:17:04,401
because he's coming into a world
where his parents are unprepared.

345
00:17:04,661 --> 00:17:06,757
They want to talk about
loving each other, as if...

346
00:17:06,877 --> 00:17:09,556
As if that has anything to do
with having

347
00:17:09,676 --> 00:17:12,253
the ability to raise a baby...
A sick baby.

348
00:17:12,373 --> 00:17:14,302
He's not prepared.
I was trying to prepare him.

349
00:17:14,422 --> 00:17:16,830
Karev,
right now you're feeling

350
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:19,373
all your feelings
right out in the open.

351
00:17:19,601 --> 00:17:22,252
Do me a favor
and stuff them back in.

352
00:17:27,719 --> 00:17:28,852
Interesting advice.

353
00:17:28,972 --> 00:17:30,249
Don't start with me.

354
00:17:35,131 --> 00:17:37,099
She's no longer allowed
in my apartment,

355
00:17:37,261 --> 00:17:39,982
so no more tea parties or wine parties
or whatever you two have.

356
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:42,521
- What are you talking about?
- Hahn. She's completely unfair

357
00:17:42,641 --> 00:17:46,193
and she refuses to teache me. I got in
at Mass Gen, I got in at Johns Hopkins.

358
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:49,154
I could have gone anywhere,
and she won't teach me!

359
00:17:49,314 --> 00:17:51,198
Look, Erica...
she's a really good listener.

360
00:17:51,358 --> 00:17:52,408
She's...

361
00:17:52,901 --> 00:17:55,744
She comes off harsh at first.
But she's got a really good heart.

362
00:17:55,904 --> 00:17:59,123
So just tell her how you feel, okay?

363
00:18:01,673 --> 00:18:04,920
Tell her how I feel?
Well, I don't speak girl.

364
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,383
Sorry about that.

365
00:18:09,543 --> 00:18:11,176
Did I mention I live with Yang now?

366
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,347
What?

367
00:18:15,507 --> 00:18:17,258
Why are you looking at me
like that?

368
00:18:18,355 --> 00:18:21,186
Are you speaking the...
vagina monologues now?

369
00:18:23,499 --> 00:18:24,513
What?

370
00:18:24,902 --> 00:18:26,932
I'm all for it, okay?
I think it's fantastic.

371
00:18:27,052 --> 00:18:28,532
Erica...
I mean, she seems great.

372
00:18:28,652 --> 00:18:31,822
I really do like her, actually.
I do, and... But are you?

373
00:18:32,061 --> 00:18:35,576
You want to know
if Erica and I are a couple?

374
00:18:35,736 --> 00:18:38,025
Because I defended her to Yang?

375
00:18:38,466 --> 00:18:39,872
Because you seem like a couple,

376
00:18:40,032 --> 00:18:41,677
a really happy couple.

377
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,752
Okay, that's...

378
00:18:44,912 --> 00:18:46,462
That's... That's just...

379
00:18:46,622 --> 00:18:49,298
That's insane is... is what it is.

380
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,012
I like penis.

381
00:18:51,345 --> 00:18:53,969
I mean, I'a huge, huge fan of penis.

382
00:18:54,584 --> 00:18:55,629
Ha! Hilarious.

383
00:18:55,749 --> 00:18:57,732
You've been living
in Los Angeles way too long.

384
00:18:57,852 --> 00:18:59,050
Way too long.

385
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:01,226
Ha! Ha! Hilari...

386
00:19:07,643 --> 00:19:08,734
Hey, listen...

387
00:19:09,847 --> 00:19:12,078
I am just the messenger,
but you should know that people

388
00:19:12,198 --> 00:19:14,202
are prepared to drop out
of the tournament tonight.

389
00:19:14,322 --> 00:19:16,617
Nobody wants to get drunk
and play darts with their boss.

390
00:19:17,634 --> 00:19:20,537
- Want me to take back the invitation?
- I'm just the messenger.

391
00:19:26,144 --> 00:19:29,838
What's that about? More special plans
with your special friends?

392
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,974
I would like us to talk today.

393
00:19:32,094 --> 00:19:33,507
I would like us to talk

394
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:36,178
because... I care

395
00:19:36,446 --> 00:19:39,040
and I want to know things

396
00:19:39,216 --> 00:19:42,142
and I have 15 minutes
to hear about your feelings.

397
00:19:42,302 --> 00:19:43,811
So... Alex...

398
00:19:44,446 --> 00:19:46,053
Alex, you look thoughtful.

399
00:19:46,173 --> 00:19:48,421
I'm very interested to hear...
I mean...

400
00:19:48,675 --> 00:19:50,275
What are your thoughts?

401
00:19:53,032 --> 00:19:55,322
Izzie, your thoughts, your feelings?

402
00:19:55,482 --> 00:19:56,661
Honestly?

403
00:19:57,025 --> 00:19:58,984
I'm a little worried about
my friend Alex here

404
00:19:59,104 --> 00:20:01,161
because his Jane Doe girlfriend
keeps showing up

405
00:20:01,321 --> 00:20:03,880
- like something outta <i>Fatal Attraction</i>.
- Her name is Rebecca Pope,

406
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,083
- and she's not my girlfriend.
- Really?

407
00:20:06,243 --> 00:20:08,168
You guys haven't... had sex...

408
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,879
at all recently?

409
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,756
She's married, okay?
She has a husband.

410
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:14,508
Does it hurt that... she's married?

411
00:20:14,694 --> 00:20:16,684
I mean, does that hurt your heart?

412
00:20:16,804 --> 00:20:19,311
- What's the matter with you?
- I'm trying to talk girl.

413
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,038
Well... Ya coded.

414
00:20:22,228 --> 00:20:23,355
Right?

415
00:20:26,734 --> 00:20:28,724
What? It's a new slang.
Everybody's saying it.

416
00:20:28,962 --> 00:20:32,283
The way you just said that,
that was you coding.

417
00:20:35,976 --> 00:20:36,989
Whatever.

418
00:20:37,149 --> 00:20:39,981
Unlike Meredith with her trials
and petri dishes,

419
00:20:40,101 --> 00:20:42,494
and Cristina, who has to practice
talking like a human being...

420
00:20:42,654 --> 00:20:44,530
I actually care about patient care.

421
00:20:46,198 --> 00:20:48,397
- I need the sparkle pager.
- She's not giving it to you.

422
00:20:48,517 --> 00:20:50,430
Well, you know what?
I can't talk girl.

423
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,073
And I shouldn't have to talk girl

424
00:20:52,193 --> 00:20:54,182
'cause I diagnosed the patient.
I need the pager.

425
00:20:54,302 --> 00:20:57,301
- You can't have the sparkle pager.
- Give it to me.

426
00:21:00,044 --> 00:21:03,265
Anyone, anyone ever think
you two were a couple?

427
00:21:03,425 --> 00:21:05,599
No, because we screw boys
like whores on tequila.

428
00:21:05,719 --> 00:21:08,198
And then we either try to marry
them or drown ourselves.

429
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,586
Well, um, make Hahn
let me scrub in,

430
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:15,350
or I'm making you move out.

431
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,256
- What? You...
- Desperate times.

432
00:21:19,766 --> 00:21:22,159
I'm sorry that took so long.

433
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:24,077
Congratulations.
You're pregnant.

434
00:21:25,548 --> 00:21:27,709
- You're sure?
- It's a big day for pregnant ladies.

435
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:30,334
Pregnant ladies everywhere I turn.
It's weird. So I'm only supposed

436
00:21:30,494 --> 00:21:32,715
to give you a couple of these,
but this is a month's supply

437
00:21:32,835 --> 00:21:34,734
of prenatal vitamins...
Samples, they're free.

438
00:21:34,854 --> 00:21:35,870
I...

439
00:21:36,443 --> 00:21:38,425
We need to schedule an abortion.

440
00:21:42,442 --> 00:21:43,879
Uh, I'm sorry. I...

441
00:21:45,378 --> 00:21:46,462
I'm sorry.

442
00:21:47,124 --> 00:21:48,359
I'm so sorry.

443
00:21:49,455 --> 00:21:51,021
I don't mean to intrude, but...

444
00:21:53,016 --> 00:21:56,211
You might wanna sit with this for a few
days before you make your decision.

445
00:21:56,331 --> 00:21:58,340
There's no decision to make.

446
00:22:00,102 --> 00:22:01,605
I'm HIV positive,

447
00:22:02,002 --> 00:22:03,514
and the condom broke.

448
00:22:05,028 --> 00:22:06,550
Oh, I got tested already,

449
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:09,611
and, um, I will again...
In six months,

450
00:22:09,731 --> 00:22:11,583
but, uh, so far I'm fine.

451
00:22:12,405 --> 00:22:13,419
So...

452
00:22:13,539 --> 00:22:16,685
Please I just...
I want to get this over with.

453
00:22:17,464 --> 00:22:20,550
Is there any chance
that we can take care of it today?

454
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:23,549
Yeah. Let me, uh...

455
00:22:23,828 --> 00:22:25,722
- Let me see what I can set up.
- Thank you.

456
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:37,115
- Here.
- All right.

457
00:22:39,148 --> 00:22:41,536
Uh, do me a...
Do me a favor

458
00:22:41,656 --> 00:22:43,323
and put Yang on your surgery.

459
00:22:43,483 --> 00:22:45,546
Only if you buy drinks at Joe's tonight.

460
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:47,119
Done.

461
00:23:02,689 --> 00:23:05,012
Dr. Montgomery,
will you do me a favor?

462
00:23:05,172 --> 00:23:07,674
- Can you talk to my patient?
- I don't work here anymore, Stevens.

463
00:23:07,794 --> 00:23:09,229
She's pregnant and HIV positive,

464
00:23:09,349 --> 00:23:11,278
she thinks
she has to terminate the pregnancy.

465
00:23:11,398 --> 00:23:13,131
- She doesn't.
- I know, but she doesn't,

466
00:23:13,251 --> 00:23:14,730
and it's not my area of expertise.

467
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:16,798
I don't work here anymore, Stevens.

468
00:23:17,421 --> 00:23:20,710
If I worked here, I would be performing
surgery after surgery after surgery.

469
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,404
I might even be back with my husband,

470
00:23:22,564 --> 00:23:24,489
who is apparently on the market,

471
00:23:24,649 --> 00:23:27,826
and I'm not saying that I want
to get back with my husband.

472
00:23:28,084 --> 00:23:30,148
It's just that things
were simpler with him

473
00:23:30,268 --> 00:23:32,310
than the messy, messy single life

474
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:34,708
I am currently living,
which was not my point,

475
00:23:34,868 --> 00:23:38,086
by the way. My point was...
that I no longer work here,

476
00:23:38,476 --> 00:23:40,630
which means you need
to pull your face

477
00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:43,864
out of the potato chip trough
and go tend to your patients yourself.

478
00:23:44,151 --> 00:23:46,261
- I know, but...
- You're a fighter. What happened?

479
00:23:47,163 --> 00:23:48,386
I lost a lot of fights.

480
00:23:49,508 --> 00:23:50,829
Time to get back up.

481
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:52,570
Go.

482
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,862
Be the change
you want to see in the world.

483
00:23:59,453 --> 00:24:01,234
Did you just quote Gandhi to me?

484
00:24:01,855 --> 00:24:04,071
It's time to take her to the OR.

485
00:24:05,623 --> 00:24:06,731
I'm not an idiot.

486
00:24:07,755 --> 00:24:08,909
We heard you.

487
00:24:09,856 --> 00:24:11,030
It could be bad,

488
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:14,729
and there's always a whole lot of bad
to focus on if you want to.

489
00:24:16,945 --> 00:24:18,579
But there's hope, too, right?

490
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,239
There's always hope, too.

491
00:24:26,626 --> 00:24:27,640
Jennifer?

492
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,330
No, it's Dr. Shepherd.

493
00:24:30,222 --> 00:24:31,283
I hate this...

494
00:24:32,409 --> 00:24:33,809
Not being able to see.

495
00:24:34,221 --> 00:24:35,714
I just want to see Jennifer.

496
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,123
This is an extremely risky operation.

497
00:24:40,243 --> 00:24:43,865
You still may have a few weeks to live.
You could spend that time with Jennifer.

498
00:24:45,355 --> 00:24:47,447
You don't have to do this surgery today.

499
00:24:50,358 --> 00:24:51,935
I'm trying to fix Jennifer up.

500
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,625
I don't want to leave her alone.

501
00:24:55,569 --> 00:24:58,292
It's the one thing about
all this I really can't stand.

502
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,860
I just want her
to be all right when I'm gone.

503
00:25:03,829 --> 00:25:05,257
You need to tell her that.

504
00:25:05,632 --> 00:25:07,191
Before you go into surgery,

505
00:25:08,161 --> 00:25:10,301
you need to remember
this conversation,

506
00:25:11,006 --> 00:25:13,014
and you need to tell her that.

507
00:25:19,723 --> 00:25:22,390
I only have five minutes
because we moved a surgery up.

508
00:25:22,602 --> 00:25:26,430
But I did want to come here and say that
obviously, he doesn't know me at all.

509
00:25:26,646 --> 00:25:28,383
I'm not the one
who's emotionally involved

510
00:25:28,524 --> 00:25:30,459
he's the one who's emotionally involved.

511
00:25:30,589 --> 00:25:31,396
"He"?

512
00:25:31,725 --> 00:25:34,485
Derek...
told me not to get my hopes up.

513
00:25:34,748 --> 00:25:38,110
Anybody who knows me knows
I'm not a hopeful person to begin with.

514
00:25:39,147 --> 00:25:41,751
I came up with this clinical trial.
It's my baby.

515
00:25:41,911 --> 00:25:44,358
Does he honestly think that
I've just walked into this thing

516
00:25:44,478 --> 00:25:46,565
with no understanding
of how hard it will be?

517
00:25:46,685 --> 00:25:49,050
Seriously. No wonder
we didn't work out.

518
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:51,394
Because he told you
not to get your hopes up.

519
00:25:51,514 --> 00:25:52,539
Exactly.

520
00:25:52,659 --> 00:25:54,556
I gotta go.
Surgery's about to start.

521
00:25:54,716 --> 00:25:56,391
The surgery with no hope?

522
00:25:57,034 --> 00:25:58,048
Shut up.

523
00:26:00,889 --> 00:26:04,701
So who's the new mystery woman
that Derek's dating?

524
00:26:04,992 --> 00:26:07,736
Who's the unlucky McRebound?

525
00:26:10,966 --> 00:26:13,776
What? Oh, is the whole
"Mc" thing over now?

526
00:26:13,896 --> 00:26:16,068
Surely things haven't changed
that much around here.

527
00:26:16,188 --> 00:26:19,289
Addison, the woman standing
immediately to your right,

528
00:26:19,409 --> 00:26:21,750
the one handing you
the surgical instruments...

529
00:26:27,656 --> 00:26:30,276
Six dates, heavy petting,
lots of tongue... Good guy.

530
00:26:30,682 --> 00:26:31,696
Scalpel?

531
00:26:36,758 --> 00:26:39,851
We can have the baby?
You're saying we can have the baby...

532
00:26:40,107 --> 00:26:41,108
A healthy baby.

533
00:26:41,228 --> 00:26:43,396
With the proper prenatal treatment,

534
00:26:43,556 --> 00:26:45,863
the risks to your baby
are substantially reduced.

535
00:26:45,983 --> 00:26:48,958
I haven't found you an OB yet,
and the process might prove really...

536
00:26:49,078 --> 00:26:52,481
It doesn't matter. We'll figure it out.
We can figure anything out.

537
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,492
I can't believe this.
Thank you.

538
00:26:56,261 --> 00:26:58,203
No. Do not thank her.

539
00:26:59,312 --> 00:27:01,005
I asked you to do one thing.

540
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:03,375
II asked you to schedule
an abortion.

541
00:27:03,535 --> 00:27:04,834
- Sarah...
- No.

542
00:27:04,994 --> 00:27:07,449
She just walks in here
and gets your hopes up,

543
00:27:07,569 --> 00:27:09,089
and that's not okay.

544
00:27:09,237 --> 00:27:11,123
I was diagnosed at 19,

545
00:27:11,243 --> 00:27:13,059
and I have learned
how to deal with it.

546
00:27:13,179 --> 00:27:15,794
But I will not put that
onto a baby.

547
00:27:15,914 --> 00:27:18,505
I cannot bring a baby
into this world

548
00:27:18,965 --> 00:27:21,739
who could possibly have
this disease. I won't.

549
00:27:21,964 --> 00:27:26,423
Now... Could you please
just schedule the abortion?

550
00:27:26,627 --> 00:27:29,150
And do me a favor.
Don't come back.

551
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,002
I'd like a different doctor.

552
00:27:53,622 --> 00:27:55,387
Remember what we talked about?

553
00:27:57,158 --> 00:27:58,323
Jennifer.

554
00:27:58,783 --> 00:27:59,787
Jen?

555
00:28:06,842 --> 00:28:08,654
I don't want to leave you alone.

556
00:28:08,948 --> 00:28:10,648
I want you to meet someone.

557
00:28:10,985 --> 00:28:13,351
I want you to promise me you'll try.

558
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:15,155
'Cause...

559
00:28:15,426 --> 00:28:18,375
I can't do this thinking
I'm leaving you alone.

560
00:28:18,913 --> 00:28:19,927
Okay?

561
00:28:27,608 --> 00:28:28,857
Maybe I'll make it.

562
00:28:30,237 --> 00:28:31,561
I hope I'll make it.

563
00:28:59,213 --> 00:29:02,118
Just a little bit further.
Good. Keep him flat.

564
00:29:12,828 --> 00:29:14,220
The placenta looks good.

565
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,674
- You okay to close, Dr. Bailey?
- Yes.

566
00:29:17,595 --> 00:29:18,718
Membrane's intact.

567
00:29:20,255 --> 00:29:22,347
Oh, no.
She's hemorrhaging.

568
00:29:23,014 --> 00:29:25,119
Oh, no. This blood is coming
a little bit too fast.

569
00:29:25,239 --> 00:29:27,324
Hey, I need
another set of hands over here.

570
00:29:29,097 --> 00:29:31,356
The uterus isn't contracting, damn it!

571
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:47,085
Where's Montgomery?

572
00:29:47,205 --> 00:29:49,332
The mom is in distress.
They're still trying to close.

573
00:29:49,492 --> 00:29:51,916
Okay, get the baby to Hahn.
Addie knows what she's doing.

574
00:29:54,769 --> 00:29:56,461
I think I've been hiding in the clinic.

575
00:29:56,581 --> 00:29:59,300
- Yeah? Okay. Listen, Izzie...
- I lost the contest.

576
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:02,604
I couldn't hack cardio.
I performed CPR on a deer.

577
00:30:02,883 --> 00:30:04,141
I think I've been hiding.

578
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:05,753
You can't come play darts with us.

579
00:30:05,873 --> 00:30:07,530
- What?
- I shouldn't have to say this.

580
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:09,186
- You should get this.
- Get what?

581
00:30:09,306 --> 00:30:11,229
You're not an intern anymore.

582
00:30:11,389 --> 00:30:13,189
And, you know,
I'm not a resident.

583
00:30:13,349 --> 00:30:16,140
And that sucks, but I'm trying
to make the best of it.

584
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,486
I'm trying to, you know,
i'm trying to stop complaining

585
00:30:18,646 --> 00:30:20,085
and embrace what I have.

586
00:30:20,287 --> 00:30:21,876
And what I have is new friends

587
00:30:21,996 --> 00:30:24,672
who don't want to get drunk
and play darts with their boss.

588
00:30:24,832 --> 00:30:26,855
- I'm their boss.
- Yes. Yeah.

589
00:30:27,315 --> 00:30:29,706
You're their boss.
You're in charge,

590
00:30:29,866 --> 00:30:31,235
and you should get that.

591
00:30:32,404 --> 00:30:33,869
I gotta do something.

592
00:30:37,858 --> 00:30:38,891
Get in here.

593
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,594
- I thought I made myself clear.
- You did.

594
00:30:42,754 --> 00:30:43,755
I didn't.

595
00:30:43,877 --> 00:30:45,135
Get in here.

596
00:30:47,798 --> 00:30:49,413
- Listen and learn.
- I knew it.

597
00:30:49,637 --> 00:30:50,735
You disapprove.

598
00:30:50,975 --> 00:30:53,010
You're here to push
some kind of agenda, right?

599
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:53,938
No.

600
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,691
Listen...

601
00:30:56,811 --> 00:30:59,353
If you want to have an abortion
because you want to have an abortion,

602
00:30:59,473 --> 00:31:01,708
then that's between you
and whatever god you believe in.

603
00:31:01,828 --> 00:31:04,140
But if you wanna have an abortion
because that's what medicine

604
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,399
is telling you to do,

605
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,185
then that's between you and me.

606
00:31:07,462 --> 00:31:09,020
I was ineffectual.

607
00:31:09,725 --> 00:31:11,227
I was unclear. I've...

608
00:31:11,881 --> 00:31:13,583
been on my heels
a little bit lately,

609
00:31:13,743 --> 00:31:16,085
and I was unclear,
so just listen, okay?

610
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:18,438
I wasn't telling you
there is some chance

611
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:20,021
your baby might not be born sick.

612
00:31:20,141 --> 00:31:23,723
I was telling you
there is a 98% chance

613
00:31:23,843 --> 00:31:25,772
your baby could be born
perfectly healthy...

614
00:31:26,006 --> 00:31:27,602
A 98% chance.

615
00:31:27,835 --> 00:31:29,754
There's a higher chance
of your baby being born

616
00:31:29,874 --> 00:31:32,910
with down syndrome than there is
of you passing HIV on to your child.

617
00:31:33,404 --> 00:31:34,687
I don't...

618
00:31:34,847 --> 00:31:36,285
I just... I can't...

619
00:31:36,405 --> 00:31:39,067
I know you gave up on
having children a long time ago,

620
00:31:39,218 --> 00:31:42,362
and I understand that it's difficult
to readjust your thinking

621
00:31:42,522 --> 00:31:44,571
so quickly, but, Sarah,

622
00:31:44,691 --> 00:31:46,431
if you take your meds responsibly,

623
00:31:46,551 --> 00:31:49,744
there's no reason why you can't
have a beautiful, healthy baby.

624
00:31:51,011 --> 00:31:52,163
This is your chance...

625
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:53,600
If you want it.

626
00:31:54,316 --> 00:31:56,044
This is your chance to be a mom.

627
00:31:59,654 --> 00:32:01,589
A 98% chance?

628
00:32:01,831 --> 00:32:03,352
A 98% chance.

629
00:32:15,006 --> 00:32:16,020
Thank you.

630
00:32:21,968 --> 00:32:24,065
We are on the clock here,
Dr. Karev.

631
00:32:24,185 --> 00:32:26,712
- We need Montgomery now.
- And she's coming. She'll be here.

632
00:32:26,832 --> 00:32:29,576
Heart rate's down to the 60s.
He's bradychardic. Damn it.

633
00:32:29,736 --> 00:32:31,635
- We could lose him.
- Tell me what to do.

634
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:35,164
Massage the heart.

635
00:32:39,202 --> 00:32:40,235
Gently.

636
00:32:47,023 --> 00:32:48,685
I can feel it getting stronger.

637
00:32:50,772 --> 00:32:52,267
Heart rate's back up to the 140s.

638
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,264
I pushed 60cc of bolused NS.

639
00:32:54,471 --> 00:32:55,685
Good job, Karev.

640
00:32:59,674 --> 00:33:00,940
You can step back now.

641
00:33:07,355 --> 00:33:08,416
And now...

642
00:33:09,308 --> 00:33:10,425
All right,

643
00:33:10,754 --> 00:33:12,003
the moment of truth.

644
00:33:13,356 --> 00:33:15,957
Injecting the virus into the tumor.

645
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:19,408
All right, we're doing this
one stage repair

646
00:33:19,528 --> 00:33:21,809
to prevent infection.
Ready for the skin graft.

647
00:33:27,202 --> 00:33:28,314
Complete heart block.

648
00:33:28,434 --> 00:33:30,511
Damn it. The injection
went into the intra-arterial.

649
00:33:30,671 --> 00:33:32,292
Okay, push one of atropine.

650
00:33:34,842 --> 00:33:37,143
- Not responding.
- Push another one. Come on.

651
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:40,794
Need another set of hands over here.

652
00:33:42,627 --> 00:33:44,233
Okay, there we go.

653
00:33:44,528 --> 00:33:46,675
- Okay, it's controlled right?
- Yeah, it's controlled.

654
00:33:46,795 --> 00:33:48,112
I got it. I got it. Go.

655
00:33:51,768 --> 00:33:52,886
Look at that...

656
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:56,941
Beating inside his chest
for the very first time.

657
00:33:57,061 --> 00:34:00,340
And God admired
his amazing skin flap...

658
00:34:00,565 --> 00:34:02,210
And he saw that it was good.

659
00:34:03,084 --> 00:34:05,650
- How is he?
- I was able to reduce the heart

660
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:08,376
almost all the way
into the pericardial space.

661
00:34:08,496 --> 00:34:10,926
No intestines in the way,
no diaphragmatic hernia?

662
00:34:11,046 --> 00:34:13,513
No anything.
His heart's in. It's beating.

663
00:34:13,673 --> 00:34:14,745
He's perfect.

664
00:34:26,121 --> 00:34:28,820
Patient number one...
Treatment failed. Call it, Dr. Grey.

665
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:32,490
Time of death... 19:33.

666
00:34:42,081 --> 00:34:43,903
The parents were right.
The baby...

667
00:34:44,175 --> 00:34:45,962
- No further complications.
- Good.

668
00:34:46,657 --> 00:34:48,169
Good, and mom's okay, too.

669
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:50,133
It's a good day.

670
00:34:51,859 --> 00:34:53,258
You seem sad...

671
00:34:53,887 --> 00:34:54,892
Miranda.

672
00:35:03,718 --> 00:35:05,164
We're not gonna do this.

673
00:35:05,935 --> 00:35:07,387
I can't share.

674
00:35:07,507 --> 00:35:10,643
I can't catch up with you.
I can't talk.

675
00:35:11,304 --> 00:35:12,543
'Cause if I did,

676
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:16,404
if I told you Tucker moved out,

677
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:18,661
if I told you

678
00:35:19,579 --> 00:35:23,086
I haven't slept alone in 12 years,

679
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,166
if I told you that my heart

680
00:35:26,469 --> 00:35:28,716
hurt so much sometimes,

681
00:35:28,836 --> 00:35:31,319
I want to rip it from my chest

682
00:35:31,439 --> 00:35:33,258
with my own little hands...

683
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,222
I would fall apart.

684
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:38,772
And I don't have time
to fall apart.

685
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:41,467
And not that I'm not happy
to see you... I am...

686
00:35:41,587 --> 00:35:44,714
But I wish
that you would go home

687
00:35:45,192 --> 00:35:48,037
so the choice to talk

688
00:35:48,425 --> 00:35:51,105
and fall apart would go away.

689
00:36:16,682 --> 00:36:17,999
I got my hopes up.

690
00:36:19,097 --> 00:36:20,431
Yeah, me, too.

691
00:36:21,297 --> 00:36:22,818
- Dr. Shepherd.
- Yes.

692
00:36:26,349 --> 00:36:28,625
It was a pleasure
working with you today.

693
00:36:34,676 --> 00:36:35,794
Dr. Grey.

694
00:36:45,664 --> 00:36:47,101
I do miss some of this.

695
00:36:47,548 --> 00:36:49,585
I could put the paperwork
through tonight.

696
00:36:49,745 --> 00:36:51,504
You could start work tomorrow.

697
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:00,449
I... need to come back...

698
00:37:02,182 --> 00:37:04,350
To see that it was right to leave.

699
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:06,584
You need to fill my position.

700
00:37:09,993 --> 00:37:11,528
I was Gandhi, Dr. Montgomery.

701
00:37:11,648 --> 00:37:14,193
I was so freakin' Gandhi,
I kicked Gandhi's ass.

702
00:37:17,867 --> 00:37:19,294
It's an L.A thing.

703
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,876
Aren't you gonna
be late for your party?

704
00:37:31,857 --> 00:37:33,256
I'm gonna blow 'em off.

705
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:35,674
I'd rather hang out with you anyway.

706
00:37:37,097 --> 00:37:38,234
George, I get it.

707
00:37:38,607 --> 00:37:41,001
I don't have to like it,
but I get it. So go.

708
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:43,910
Go "code" or whatever.

709
00:37:45,053 --> 00:37:46,912
You know,
whenever anyone, uh,

710
00:37:47,308 --> 00:37:49,890
says something really funny,
and I'm laughing, I always...

711
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:52,666
look around to see
if you think it's funny, too.

712
00:37:52,786 --> 00:37:55,078
Even when you're not there,
I still look around.

713
00:37:59,988 --> 00:38:00,992
Go.

714
00:38:38,998 --> 00:38:42,059
I bet you wish you'd taken the stairs
right about now.

715
00:38:45,143 --> 00:38:47,912
<i>Giving birth may be all intense
and magical and stuff,</i>

716
00:38:48,166 --> 00:38:51,565
<i>but the act itself?
It's not exactly pleasant.</i>

717
00:38:52,735 --> 00:38:56,170
<i>But it's also a beginning
of something incredible...</i>

718
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:58,631
I am very, very funny. Oh, my god.

719
00:38:58,751 --> 00:39:00,684
- You wouldn't believe what she...
- Wait, wait.

720
00:39:00,804 --> 00:39:03,413
- Hang on, hang on...
- That was some really funny...

721
00:39:03,533 --> 00:39:06,087
You've got a hair that's caught...

722
00:39:07,133 --> 00:39:08,391
Caught in your lip gloss.

723
00:39:08,701 --> 00:39:09,934
<i>Something new...</i>

724
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:12,144
Sorry. You were saying?

725
00:39:12,304 --> 00:39:14,272
- No, really, I'm just very funny.
- Funny, hmm?

726
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:16,683
- Yes, it turns out I am.
- Apparently.

727
00:39:17,096 --> 00:39:18,901
Any of you ladies want to dance?

728
00:39:19,709 --> 00:39:22,932
For the thousandth time,
the answer is no, Mark.

729
00:39:23,052 --> 00:39:24,740
- Beat it, Sloan.
- I'll dance with you.

730
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,537
<i>Something unpredictable...</i>

731
00:39:29,307 --> 00:39:31,222
Dr. Montgomery.
Dr. Hahn.

732
00:39:31,476 --> 00:39:32,518
Yang?

733
00:39:35,771 --> 00:39:37,878
Okay, is it...
Is it 'cause I'm asian?

734
00:39:38,038 --> 00:39:40,177
Is that your problem?
You don't like asian people?

735
00:39:40,297 --> 00:39:42,633
- Excuse me?
- Why won't you teach me?

736
00:39:45,123 --> 00:39:48,165
You're not without skill,
you're not without talent...

737
00:39:48,991 --> 00:39:51,618
So stop seeking my approval.

738
00:39:51,738 --> 00:39:55,604
I am not gonna tell you what a good
little girl you are, it's not my job,

739
00:39:55,764 --> 00:39:58,348
and frankly, it doesn't
make you any better at yours.

740
00:40:05,325 --> 00:40:06,358
Jeez.

741
00:40:07,286 --> 00:40:09,243
Little hard on her,
don't you think?

742
00:40:10,638 --> 00:40:12,751
I think she reminds me of me.

743
00:40:12,873 --> 00:40:14,123
<i>Something true...</i>

744
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,462
She's pretty, huh?

745
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:22,715
She's beautiful.

746
00:40:24,124 --> 00:40:25,683
<i>Something worth loving...</i>

747
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:34,370
Wanna get outta here?

748
00:40:34,774 --> 00:40:36,680
Like you wouldn't believe.

749
00:40:46,507 --> 00:40:48,028
<i>Something worth missing...<i>

750
00:40:50,461 --> 00:40:51,619
Dr. Stevens,

751
00:40:51,779 --> 00:40:53,120
labs for Rebecca Pope.

752
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,535
Thanks very much.

753
00:40:56,375 --> 00:40:59,668
No, this can't be right.
Are you sure this is right?

754
00:41:00,136 --> 00:41:01,517
Hey, you leaving already?

755
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,268
I have a plane to catch.

756
00:41:09,179 --> 00:41:10,456
I walk on the beach now,

757
00:41:10,631 --> 00:41:13,402
I buy aromatherapy candles,
I'm very zen...

758
00:41:14,001 --> 00:41:17,139
But I... want to kick
your ass so badly right now,

759
00:41:17,259 --> 00:41:18,938
it is killing me.

760
00:41:19,347 --> 00:41:21,816
- Excuse me?
- I'm talking about Derek...

761
00:41:22,389 --> 00:41:24,934
Derek Christopher Shepherd.

762
00:41:26,072 --> 00:41:27,819
Are you letting him get away?

763
00:41:29,066 --> 00:41:30,906
Because I swear to god, Meredith,

764
00:41:31,026 --> 00:41:34,209
if you let him ride off into the sunset
with that doe-eyed little thing...

765
00:41:43,714 --> 00:41:44,784
Of course I'm sure.

766
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,636
So my patient is not pregnant?

767
00:41:46,756 --> 00:41:47,977
Apparently not.

768
00:41:59,627 --> 00:42:01,590
<i>Something that will change your life...</i>

769
00:42:07,571 --> 00:42:08,623
<i>Forever.</i>
