1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:04,760
surgeons aren't known for being warm and cuddly

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:09,290
they are arrogant, impatient, mean as often as nugget

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,460
you can go with straight up chemo and immunol therapy

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,600
the survival rates are prttey low, but

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,580
there is a lot of succsefull metastat-sectomies.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,190
we could propbly just, you know, cut this thing out

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,300
you think they wouldn't have friends

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,400
- 'cuz who could stand them. - what are you hiding?

9
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,260
nothing. its just work stuff.

10
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,940
- what is that? physical surgery?  - no. its nothing.

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,950
its nothing

12
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:29,710
whatever it is ,they're gonna pick me

13
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,570
i'm already for the solo. Just for training well.

14
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,950
- are you sure you just won't tell him  - yes, i am sure

15
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,670
ok look, I researched a ton of information here

16
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:42,700
you should read all of this before you see this oncologist.

17
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,880
What is that?

18
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,930
i called dr. golding and he gave me a direct profile of dr. Swender.

19
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,610
so i gonna try and get you in today

20
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,580
what are you doing here,i told you i was fine

21
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,230
Oh, god. You are so not fine.

22
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,200
i will be fine if i knew Derek is fine

23
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,470
what? you still haven't heared from him? no word?

24
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,940
Izzie, don't you think you should call in sick today?

25
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,510
- what? why? - because this is a lot of reading

26
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,360
and you are sick

27
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,480
- you guys coming? big surgery today  - yeah

28
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,300
izzie, just

29
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,810
but surgeons are like a bad cold

30
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:21,590
nasty but persistent

31
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:24,650
- chief, i need to ask you about  - Sloan

32
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:26,220
have you heared from Derek

33
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:27,620
no.

34
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,890
oh, i am sorry. you were saying?

35
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:34,640
- Meredith - no, i don't know how he is.i have heared nothing

36
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,130
nothing today, nothing yesterday, nothing the day before that.

37
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,480
and no. i will not go back out there.

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,990
hey, why move my surgery.

39
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:47,660
- chief,chief.  - don't. just don't

40
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,710
he's a wreck.He's disintegrating before our very eyes.

41
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:54,620
That's why men die earlier than women.

42
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,310
- board's a mess.  - he can't lose sheperd

43
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,820
i'll go talk a sense to him, but

44
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,300
- just got too much on my plate  - have you tried calling him?

45
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,030
about a hundred times

46
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,740
no. oh. you want me to go to the woods. no .

47
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,750
i don't do woods. the woods are dirty and there are many many bugs

48
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,580
what am i gonna say to the guy? i barely know him.

49
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,030
you don't have to know him. you're both surgeons.

50
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,680
and you've been to the same war

51
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,100
just remind him we've all been there.

52
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,300
we all came back.

53
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,540
you are kind of a bully, you know that?

54
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,460
wouldn't do it if it didn't work so well.

55
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,975
this is one of the biggest surgeries

56
00:02:37,975 --> 00:02:40,440
you may have ever get anywhere near. so please pay attention

57
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,360
the patient is 38-year-old man

58
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,090
who is hit by a drunk driver 12 years ago.

59
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,760
he suffered severe facial trouble

60
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,430
he's got no nose no lips

61
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,040
thats why we dubed him blowhole

62
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,070
he's had 9 reconstructive surgeries

63
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,320
none of which brought back full form or function

64
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,400
this surgery have already been done 4 times worldwide and

65
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:59,490
all of the candidates have to undergo extensive psychologicl testing

66
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:02,190
to determine wheather or not they can handle the process

67
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,890
psychological components are assigned cuz

68
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:06,710
this surgery has a huge chance of rejection or infection

69
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,510
patient will have to be in a room ...

70
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:10,560
we will be on right for antirejection drugs

71
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,780
which pretty might risk for lung foma, diabetes,

72
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,980
hypertension, remon failure

73
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,640
i hear they call the dude blowhole

74
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,710
what did you just say?

75
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,800
nothing i just heared the other nickname.

76
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,310
don't talk anymore, ever!

77
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,750
holly crap!

78
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,940
- blowhole is right  - what did i tell you?

79
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:41,890
surgeons, nasty, aggressive, unstoppable.

80
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:44,140
just the kind of people you want on your side

81
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,280
when you are really screwed

82
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,590
ladies and gentlemen this is MR david young

83
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,610
today he will be receiving a face transplant

84
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,610
Dr. hunt and his team

85
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,760
Will be recovering the donor facial graft.

86
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,950
We're replacing 70% of mr. young's face.

87
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,490
- see the deficit here. - or here.

88
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:10,210
The donor recovery will include his nose

89
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,930
Left eye, lips, left zygoma.

90
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,790
Why will allotransplantation

91
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,725
Work better than traditional techniques?

92
00:04:16,725 --> 00:04:18,640
better aesthetic outcome,

93
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,600
Which allows for reinnervation of the facial nerves,

94
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,900
Giving a better functional result.

95
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,040
Very good, dr. grey.

96
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,810
Then we'll position the flap over mr. young's face.

97
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,840
How do we know when we're in the clear?

98
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,250
when the graft turns pink.

99
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:29,830
Excellent.

100
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,450
Dave, any questions for us?

101
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,070
H-has anyone seen the donor?

102
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:40,260
Yes. he's a match with your age, skin tone and blood type.

103
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,930
What does he look like?

104
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:45,760
I think you'll be satisfied.

105
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,330
Who am I kidding? it's a face, right?

106
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:51,630
If I end up anything above a point-and-stare freak,

107
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,420
I'm gonna call it a success.

108
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,100
Karev, you're with me on the donor.

109
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,550
Usually we take them at the same time,

110
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,760
But the donor's life support is fading fast. we gotta move.

111
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,290
- Oh, thank you, sir. - uh, stevens, grey.

112
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,140
Yes!

113
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,720
No, the other grey.

114
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,680
- Really? uh, great. - great.

115
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,330
You did an awesome job in there.

116
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,580
Why don't you call me after the pre-op labs come in?

117
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,260
Dr. sloan, only one resident?

118
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,710
Wait for bailey. there's already going to be enough of a crowd.

119
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:22,470
What the hell?

120
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,280
Uh, izzie,

121
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,960
I don't think you have time to scrub in with sloan.

122
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,450
- Don't worry about it. I can handle it. - awesome job.

123
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,440
She probably quizzed him in bed last night.

124
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,380
She gets to work on blowhole because she gave sloan a--

125
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,280
Shut your mouths!

126
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,520
Finish the chart. I'll be back.

127
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,800
Uh, o'malley, grey,

128
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,430
I need you on pre-ops and post-ops.

129
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:49,460
But there's the biggest surgery in the world happening here today.

130
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,000
Yes, and half our attendings are involved,

131
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,430
which is why we need strong residents on pre-ops and post-ops.

132
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,550
Yang, you're with me today.

133
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,510
You're moving to the big leagues. what?

134
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,990
- She gets a solo? - today?

135
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:01,495
A nice old lady with a hernia. you're gonna fix it.

136
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:03,280
congratulations.

137
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,390
I know I should seem more enthusiastic,

138
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,920
But I'm not that big a person.

139
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:07,950
Don't worry about it.

140
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:12,270
Is it wrong to have hatred in your heart?

141
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,660
Good morning, ms. sully. I'm dr. cristina yang.

142
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,840
I'll be performing your hernia repair today.

143
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,550
Lovely to meet you.

144
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,260
do you have any questions before we get started?

145
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,240
Oh, yes. can you hand me my purse, please?

146
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:27,260
My friends gave me a bunch of questions,

147
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,540
And, well, I can't remember any of them, of course.

148
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,990
They're such worrywarts.

149
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,590
They're all off on a european tour without me.

150
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,870
They threatened not to go when this hernia

151
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:38,060
Started becoming a problem, but I told them no, no.

152
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,800
We have been saving up for this for two years.

153
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,400
It helped that I was able to get my deposit back

154
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,500
With a doctor's note. mm-hmm.

155
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,360
Cristina yang.

156
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:50,530
Yes.

157
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:54,010
No, no, it has to be today.

158
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,170
It's stage iv.

159
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,690
No, she has to see dr. swender,

160
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:58,700
Not--not a partner.

161
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,770
Uh... um, I'm sorry, ma'am.

162
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,010
Um, I will get to your questions

163
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:06,010
When I come back to examine you, okay?

164
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:08,610
Referral was golding. golding.

165
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,130
It's a little early in the day for that,

166
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,000
Don't you think?

167
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,130
You sound like my mother.

168
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:26,030
Uh, I met your mother. I liked her.

169
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,540
Who sent you--richard?

170
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,330
Uh, bailey.

171
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,570
Of course.

172
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,760
Look, I'm sorry about your patient.

173
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,310
I know how hard it could be.

174
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,240
I-i had a patient a couple of years ago--

175
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,290
Uh, young guy, 50 maybe.

176
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,120
Simple knee replacement.

177
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,930
He was post-op, he was fine.

178
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,880
I even told his wife she could go and get him lunch.

179
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,690
I mean, it was a simple knee replacement. it was nothing.

180
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,270
But, uh, he'd been getting short of breath,

181
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:55,080
So I put him on blood thinners for a post-surgical p.e.

182
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,350
And, uh, it wasn't until he was vomiting up dark red blood,

183
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,410
Looking me in the eye telling me that he was dying

184
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,030
That I figured it out-- that I was wrong.

185
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,110
That it wasn't a p.e. he was bleeding internally.

186
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:10,180
And it wouldn't have been fatal, but the blood thinners...

187
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:16,320
God, I will never forget the look on his wife's face...

188
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,460
When she came back with that sandwich in her hand,

189
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,130
Asking me why her husband wasn't in his room anymore.

190
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,190
How do you live with it?

191
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,490
Killing him...

192
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,490
Taking him from his wife--

193
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,420
How do you live with it?

194
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,880
We call it malpractice. we call it a mistake.

195
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,340
Yeah, I know what we call it.

196
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,710
I'm asking you, when you get up in the morning,

197
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,620
How do you look at yourself in the mirror?

198
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,520
I'm not--i'm--i'm...

199
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,750
I'm asking.

200
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,860
Can I get one of those?

201
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,470
It's the not knowing that does it--

202
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,280
Not knowing if he's okay, not knowing if he's coming back.

203
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,460
Maybe I've just been dumped.

204
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,450
I mean, it's not knowing if I'm single

205
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,980
That makes me want to throw up all day long.

206
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,250
- You are not listening to me, are you? - uh, sorry.

207
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,380
No, no, that's okay. I get it.

208
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,470
You've got the solo surgery and g.i. joe.

209
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:27,040
It's a charmed life. you don't have time for me.

210
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,860
I have not had g.i. joe. we've kissed a couple times.

211
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,430
It's like friends with benefits,

212
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,730
Without the benefits.

213
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,570
Still no sex?

214
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,590
Mnh-mnh. not a charmed life.

215
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,700
Lab results on the splenectomy.

216
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,020
Do we ask?

217
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:48,050
No... 'cause he might tell us.

218
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:52,130
Can you imagine?

219
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,360
This guy's got a family, right?

220
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,820
A wife, kids?

221
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,590
One day they're gonna be walking down the street

222
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,410
And see his face on somebody else's body.

223
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,560
It's kinda creepy, right?

224
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:04,240
Mr. young won't look exactly like the donor.

225
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,160
The underlying facial structure

226
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,005
Of any two people can be very different.

227
00:10:08,005 --> 00:10:11,600
plus, a person's identity is more than just skin and bone--

228
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,330
His expressions, his style, his eyes.

229
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:17,080
The donor's family wouldn't recognize this face on anyone else.

230
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,150
Transplant surgeons are getting antsy.

231
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,990
Transplant surgeons are always antsy.

232
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:24,330
They can't relax until they've got live tissue in their coolers.

233
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:27,090
All right, I am making the final dissection.

234
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:30,170
Karev, take a hold right at the temple

235
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,230
And gently...lift

236
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,420
Don't tear the flesh.

237
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,220
Awesome.

238
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,780
Tenderness around the incision is normal.

239
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,650
No signs of infection. Would you redress that wound?

240
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,220
Uh, Megan, will you please go to 20...

241
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:01,720
Go to room 22-14 and...

242
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,890
Thanks.

243
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:06,580
Just take out the drain... When you're ready?

244
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,390
Uh, I know it seems personal,

245
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,110
And we wouldn't ask if we didn't need to know,

246
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,610
But have you passed gas yet?

247
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,010
Sorry.

248
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,280
We can't release you until that happens--

249
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,690
- The gas. - I'm sorry. I'm trying to listen.

250
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:28,850
But are they supposed to look like that?

251
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:29,780
Like what?

252
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,900
The bleeding and the shiner,

253
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,850
And that one looks like she's suicidal.

254
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,620
They're supposed to be doctors?

255
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:39,193
We're gonna reserve judgment on that for right now.

256
00:11:39,194 --> 00:11:40,030
Freak show.

257
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,080
What the heck do we do with them?

258
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,750
can we shove them in a locker?

259
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:46,370
I guess we should just talk to them.

260
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,847
No. We're professionals,

261
00:11:48,848 --> 00:11:50,690
and that's clearly personal.

262
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,170
besides, we'll just waste time.

263
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,670
We'll never get to see the solo surgery or the face transplant.

264
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,910
Oh, that's a-- yeah, that's a good point.

265
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:59,210
I guess, well, we should-- we should just ignore it then.

266
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:00,600
yeah, we should just ignore it.

267
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,095
It's the professional thing to do.

268
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:03,570
yeah, professionally ignore them.

269
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,880
It's important that you take all the medications,

270
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,320
Uh, because there's a risk of--

271
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,150
Risk of rejection and infection. I know.

272
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,830
I know. you drilled it into my head a thousand times.

273
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:18,710
And is your family here yet? I'm--i just ask because

274
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:21,016
Someone's gonna need to take care of you afterwards.

275
00:12:21,017 --> 00:12:21,940
I don't have family,

276
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,270
But my friends are coming after the surgery.

277
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:27,520
I'm excited to meet them and show them my new face.

278
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,720
We met in an online chat room for orchid lovers,

279
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,920
And, well, um, we've never actually "met" met, so...

280
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,930
Dave, um, after the surgery,

281
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,870
This device is gonna help prevent lung problems

282
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,840
By exercising the muscles you use to breathe.

283
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,200
- I'd like you to practice on it now, okay? - Sit up straight.

284
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,770
Take three easy breaths and then blow... into that...

285
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,160
Hole.

286
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,060
That's it.

287
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,490
Both of you in the hall, now.

288
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,300
You really think that was okay?!

289
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,655
You think that was doctorly?!

290
00:12:56,656 --> 00:12:58,170
you two find something else to do.

291
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,380
What the hell is going on with you?

292
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,420
They were making completely inappropriate jokes

293
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,060
At the expense of the patient right in front of him.

294
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,840
I have been trying to teach them,

295
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,194
And they were cruel and inappropriate.

296
00:13:09,195 --> 00:13:10,990
okay, they were inappropriate.

297
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:14,300
You know what else is inappropriate? this. you.

298
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,670
This case is my baby.

299
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:18,300
I've spent three years planning for it,

300
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,680
And you and your emotional life

301
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,690
Are not about to piss all over it.

302
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,725
- You're off the case.  - No.

303
00:13:22,726 --> 00:13:24,430
he needs me in there with him.

304
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,520
You can't leave him alone with those interns.

305
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,340
Okay, fine. you want to be there for his feelings?

306
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,760
You can be there before and after the surgery.

307
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,410
But you're not coming in my o.r.

308
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:34,130
And whatever's going on with you, stevens,

309
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,380
You better get it under control.

310
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,210
I found them.

311
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:43,390
What? oh, um, the, uh, questions about the surgery?

312
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:45,690
One of my friends who went on the trip--Bill Ferguson.

313
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:47,310
He's a retired surgeon,

314
00:13:47,311 --> 00:13:48,910
and he told me to ask you these,

315
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,390
But I can't seem to find my glasses.

316
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:51,980
My friends should be here.

317
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,250
I'm always putting my glasses down somewhere,

318
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,630
- And they always find them for me-- - okay,

319
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,850
"will you finally be able to pick up your grandkids?"

320
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,380
Is--is this a question from a doctor?

321
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,840
No. no, my other friends helped me with some questions,

322
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,910
Plus I added a few on my own, like will it hurt?

323
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,060
Will it... hurt?

324
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:10,780
You'll be anesthetized.

325
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,890
Oh, yes, I know that.

326
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,060
I mean, after, will it hurt?

327
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,940
Uh, you should expect normal, post-operative pain.

328
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,550
Yes.

329
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:22,680
Yes.

330
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,010
Oh, no. that is fantastic.

331
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,390
No, I'll--i'll take it. I'll take it.

332
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,090
Thank you so much. thank you.

333
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,320
No, I'll get in touch with her right away.

334
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,230
Um, 2:30? anytime is fine.

335
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:36,330
So I've covered 22-13, 19 and 33.

336
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:40,690
Yeah, okay. and I've got 20-11 and 20-07.

337
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:43,880
Mer, there is something wrong with izzie.

338
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,550
Uh, what do you mean?

339
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:47,560
I don't know.

340
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,940
All I know is that there is something wrong.

341
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,450
Well, you know, george,

342
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:51,570
We're already drowning in intern drama.

343
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,250
We don't need resident drama, too.

344
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:55,670
If it's a problem, she'll tell us.

345
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:57,290
Until then, just ignore it.

346
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,890
I repeat, ignore it.

347
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,444
What in god's name is going on?

348
00:15:07,444 --> 00:15:08,270
it's a personal issue,

349
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,380
And we are just trying to give them their privacy.

350
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,720
Oh, do you think for a second

351
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,210
I wanted to get involved with your little intern dramas?

352
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:18,740
- We were not this bad. - oh, uh, getting married in vegas,

353
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,370
Shaking up with attendings, cutting l-vad wires?

354
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,955
Look, you don't have to like it,

355
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:24,160
but you have to manage it.

356
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,990
Oh, we've got it under control.

357
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,590
Wait! I love you, Megan!

358
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:34,590
Sir. Are you ok?

359
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,890
I'm so sorry.

360
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,975
Whatever it is the two of you have going on,

361
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,520
it stops now.

362
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,600
- I didn't  - I-i don't think you should talk while she's talking.

363
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,700
You are scaring the patients.

364
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,940
And you're making this hospital look ridiculous,

365
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,580
And you're making us look incompetent.

366
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,070
- No, but we have  - No, it's not a good idea.

367
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:57,790
Just stay away from each other. so much as a tear

368
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:00,170
Or a glance in each other's direction, and it's over.

369
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:03,510
- I don't understand-- - no, no, no. don't talk while I'm talking.

370
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,910
That's what I was...

371
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:07,210
Now just get out.

372
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,010
Go.

373
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,820
Not together.

374
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,570
Oh, that felt good.

375
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,110
You paged me, dr. bailey?

376
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,268
Oh, yes.

377
00:16:17,469 --> 00:16:19,850
you're finished with your part of the face transplant, right?

378
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,140
Yes, but I cleared my schedule

379
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,800
To watch sloan and dr. yang do their surgeries.

380
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,830
So whatever it is you need,

381
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,630
I hope it's not too time consuming.

382
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:28,470
That all depends on how fast you can drive and talk.

383
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,390
Uh, I'm sorry.

384
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,790
I need you to drive out to the woods

385
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:34,610
And talk derek shepherd into coming back here.

386
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:38,140
And I believe you also might run into callie torres,

387
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,770
With a flat tire or a broken heel

388
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,450
Or an... ax-wielding serial killer.

389
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:47,440
- You're serious? - see, I sent torres after shepherd,

390
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,860
And she's fallen off the grid.

391
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,340
Her phone goes straight to voice mail.

392
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,040
Okay, i--i'm normally not a panicky person,

393
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,230
But I'm a fan of daytime television,

394
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,420
And, you know, the mind creates these scenarios--

395
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,520
Uh, never mind.

396
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:01,770
I need you to go get torres and shepherd

397
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,080
And bring them back here

398
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,740
Before the chief notices that any of you are gone.

399
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,200
Shepherd's been gone all week.

400
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,130
- I'm sure the chief wouldn't notice-- - Hunt!

401
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,240
You survived a war. mm-hmm.

402
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,140
You can do this.

403
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,700
I know I can do this. I'm saying I don't want to.

404
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:24,820
People don't really say no to you, do they?

405
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,620
Not when I say please.

406
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,530
I'm saying please.

407
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,460
O.r.'s set. transport's on its way.

408
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,900
- You ready? - I've been ready for 12 years.

409
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,910
Y-you said you had some friends

410
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:42,350
- That were coming to take care of you? - yeah, after my surgery.

411
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:44,500
They're coming now.

412
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,050
Surprise!

413
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:50,310
Hi, it's me, Shayna.

414
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,400
You can probably tell from my vanda rothschildiana.

415
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,790
Uh, I hope you're not mad that we came early.

416
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,940
We thought we should be here through it all,

417
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,470
- Make sure you knew-- - get out.

418
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,513
Get them out. they're strangers.

419
00:18:03,514 --> 00:18:04,790
I don't want them in here.

420
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:07,590
Well, we're hardly strangers, Dave.

421
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:10,100
We chat every night, all night for years.

422
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,430
- We--we flew in s-- -get out!

423
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,450
We've never met. you don't know me.

424
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,010
You don't know anything about me. get out.

425
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,690
Get--get them out! get out! get out!

426
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,930
Get out!

427
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,880
Hey, did you get my page?

428
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,120
You got the appointment. it's in, like, 15 minutes.

429
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,470
God, how amazing am i?

430
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:39,040
It usually takes weeks to get in there.

431
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:39,985
Uh, did you take a look at the research?

432
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:41,500
seriously? can I just eat?

433
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,800
No. I'm sorry. you don't have time.

434
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,690
Time for what?

435
00:18:45,915 --> 00:18:48,814
To do, uh, there's, uh, an enema.

436
00:18:48,834 --> 00:18:51,670
Uh, izzie's enema.

437
00:18:51,851 --> 00:18:54,704
Yes, I was supposed to get an enema today,

438
00:18:54,882 --> 00:18:56,256
But I decided it can wait.

439
00:18:56,276 --> 00:18:57,565
How about we talk about something else?

440
00:18:57,585 --> 00:18:59,289
N-no. we need to talk about it.

441
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:03,515
You've been complaining about being really backed up,

442
00:19:03,535 --> 00:19:04,646
And I got you an appointment.

443
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,077
Dude, if you need an enema that bad,

444
00:19:06,097 --> 00:19:06,987
maybe you shouldn't have all these fries.

445
00:19:07,007 --> 00:19:09,277
You really booked her an appointment for an enema?

446
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,550
You can't just say that you're all backed up

447
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:12,872
and just sit there, izzie.

448
00:19:12,872 --> 00:19:14,174
If you make the decision to get an enema,

449
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:16,419
then you should get an enema.

450
00:19:16,439 --> 00:19:18,842
I think maybe you're the one that's backed up.

451
00:19:18,862 --> 00:19:21,588
Solo surgery panic?

452
00:19:21,608 --> 00:19:23,098
Tell you what--I'll scrub in with you.

453
00:19:23,098 --> 00:19:24,588
If you can't handle it, I'll take over.

454
00:19:24,608 --> 00:19:26,852
I don't--i'm--no. okay.

455
00:19:26,872 --> 00:19:29,288
You know, I'm just saying,

456
00:19:29,946 --> 00:19:31,809
Enemas can be a serious business.

457
00:19:31,829 --> 00:19:34,693
Okay. izzie, "enema" is code for what?

458
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,075
My enema, my business.

459
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:40,097
Uh, 15 minutes.

460
00:19:40,849 --> 00:19:42,910
This is a really strange day.

461
00:19:44,741 --> 00:19:46,590
I was a second-year resident.

462
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:47,598
M.v.c. rolls in.

463
00:19:47,618 --> 00:19:49,591
Parents were in the front seat, three kids in the back.

464
00:19:49,611 --> 00:19:50,503
Kids were okay.

465
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:53,123
Mom and dad were a little banged up, but nothing terrible.

466
00:19:53,466 --> 00:19:55,752
They were talking and laughing in the E.R.

467
00:19:55,772 --> 00:19:59,081
Turns out both parents had massive internal injuries.

468
00:19:59,101 --> 00:20:02,280
I operated on them both that night--hours.

469
00:20:02,474 --> 00:20:03,969
Lost 'em both.

470
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,336
You know, if I had moved faster,

471
00:20:07,356 --> 00:20:09,192
if I had rushed them to c.t.,

472
00:20:09,212 --> 00:20:11,338
if I had known how bad off they were sooner,

473
00:20:11,358 --> 00:20:13,529
But I didn't.

474
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:15,106
The oldest kid was 9.

475
00:20:15,126 --> 00:20:17,402
When I came out to tell 'em about their dad,

476
00:20:18,505 --> 00:20:20,537
he was trying to console the 3 year old

477
00:20:20,557 --> 00:20:21,900
and the 5 year old about their mother.

478
00:20:22,837 --> 00:20:24,795
I'll never get that image out of my head--this--

479
00:20:24,815 --> 00:20:28,457
This 9-year-old boy trying to hold these 2 little ones,

480
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,565
And his arms-- just not big enough.

481
00:20:33,803 --> 00:20:35,619
I don't know how I came back the next day.

482
00:20:38,317 --> 00:20:40,000
I think part of me never did.

483
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,174
I'm surprised you didn't talk about Iraq.

484
00:20:45,261 --> 00:20:46,371
I don't talk about Iraq.

485
00:20:46,391 --> 00:20:48,631
At I'm-- what my point was--

486
00:20:48,651 --> 00:20:49,132
I kept...

487
00:20:49,614 --> 00:20:51,821
You know, I... I went back.

488
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,707
I showed up. I...

489
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:57,149
I showed up for work, you know?

490
00:20:58,601 --> 00:20:59,999
Or you go dead inside.

491
00:21:01,349 --> 00:21:03,810
You go dead inside because if you actually felt it?

492
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:07,583
If you let yourself feel that? No way you're going back.

493
00:21:07,962 --> 00:21:08,579
No way.

494
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,364
You blew it off?

495
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,281
Cristina, please.

496
00:21:31,982 --> 00:21:34,976
I called every favor I had in this hospital

497
00:21:34,996 --> 00:21:35,690
And then some.

498
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,291
Swender's the best surgical oncologist In this state.

499
00:21:38,311 --> 00:21:39,894
- Why didn't you go?  - why do you care so much?

500
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:43,873
Oh, why don't you? I'm working really hard on this.

501
00:21:43,893 --> 00:21:45,302
So the least you can do is

502
00:21:45,302 --> 00:21:46,712
they were calling the guy blowhole, cristina.

503
00:21:46,732 --> 00:21:48,599
Not just the interns-- Alex.

504
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,552
What are they gonna call me when I'm the patient,

505
00:21:52,439 --> 00:21:53,575
Swiss cheese for brains?

506
00:21:53,775 --> 00:21:55,159
No. That's awkward and long.

507
00:21:55,159 --> 00:21:56,544
Blowhole's pithy.

508
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,669
I'm not gonna be a piece of meat in this hospital

509
00:21:58,689 --> 00:22:00,705
While you all fight over who gets to slice me up

510
00:22:00,725 --> 00:22:02,131
and then laugh while you do it.

511
00:22:02,151 --> 00:22:04,014
Okay, this right here--

512
00:22:04,034 --> 00:22:06,182
This, um, is

513
00:22:06,202 --> 00:22:08,562
A-an emotional thing you're having--

514
00:22:08,582 --> 00:22:11,481
Which is why you should tell Meredith or George or--

515
00:22:11,501 --> 00:22:13,986
I'm not telling anybody, so just drop it.

516
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,340
No. y-you're not dumping this on me.

517
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:18,980
You're not dying in my arms.

518
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,492
So either you tell them, or I will.

519
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:24,296
No, I don't even know if I want treatment, cristina.

520
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,859
I know too much.

521
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:28,858
I know how violent surgery can be.

522
00:22:28,878 --> 00:22:29,909
They're gonna cut into my brain.

523
00:22:29,929 --> 00:22:31,228
They're gonna slice open my abdomen

524
00:22:31,248 --> 00:22:33,451
And pull my organs out, and for what?

525
00:22:33,786 --> 00:22:35,926
Surgery fails all the time.

526
00:22:35,946 --> 00:22:38,048
Derek shepherd is in the freakin' woods right now

527
00:22:38,068 --> 00:22:40,761
Because we fail all the time.

528
00:22:40,781 --> 00:22:42,617
And even if they do everything right,

529
00:22:42,637 --> 00:22:45,434
I have a 5% chance of survival 5%

530
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:49,407
Why would I put myself through hell,

531
00:22:49,427 --> 00:22:52,202
Run poison through my veins, irradiate my brain,

532
00:22:52,222 --> 00:22:53,911
If it's not gonna work anyway?

533
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:01,102
Why did you tell me, then?

534
00:23:01,518 --> 00:23:03,096
If you don't want my help,

535
00:23:03,116 --> 00:23:05,181
And you're not gonna do anything about it,

536
00:23:05,201 --> 00:23:06,414
Why did you tell me?

537
00:23:08,337 --> 00:23:11,046
Just keep your mouth shut

538
00:23:11,066 --> 00:23:12,335
And forget I ever told you anything.

539
00:23:12,335 --> 00:23:13,605
Izzie. Oh.

540
00:23:20,241 --> 00:23:21,962
You need to call 'em back, Dave.

541
00:23:22,826 --> 00:23:25,970
You're my surgeon, right?

542
00:23:26,201 --> 00:23:27,459
You're not my shrink.

543
00:23:27,479 --> 00:23:28,917
So why don't you just do your job?

544
00:23:28,937 --> 00:23:31,179
Because I can't do my job anymore.

545
00:23:31,784 --> 00:23:34,505
It took us three years to find the right candidate,

546
00:23:34,525 --> 00:23:36,093
And part of you being the right candidate

547
00:23:36,113 --> 00:23:37,966
Is having a support system post-op.

548
00:23:37,986 --> 00:23:40,071
You cannot do this alone.

549
00:23:40,091 --> 00:23:41,353
The ethics board will not allow me

550
00:23:41,373 --> 00:23:43,257
To let you do it alone.

551
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:45,503
You need your friends.

552
00:23:46,488 --> 00:23:47,990
You see that orchid?

553
00:23:49,206 --> 00:23:50,744
It's--it's ugly.

554
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:52,865
To anyone who doesn't know orchids,

555
00:23:52,885 --> 00:23:55,288
It's dark and droopy and it's ugly...

556
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:56,092
Unless you know it,

557
00:23:56,092 --> 00:23:56,877
Unless you understand how it adapted

558
00:23:56,897 --> 00:24:02,526
What it's lived through,

559
00:24:02,546 --> 00:24:05,350
And how strong it had to be to survive.

560
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:07,119
A photo of that orchid,

561
00:24:07,139 --> 00:24:09,002
That's the only picture my friends have seen of me.

562
00:24:09,022 --> 00:24:10,972
And that's how I wanted them to picture me

563
00:24:10,992 --> 00:24:12,901
Until I had my new face.

564
00:24:14,962 --> 00:24:17,496
People look away from me.

565
00:24:19,746 --> 00:24:21,618
Kids cry and...

566
00:24:22,367 --> 00:24:24,110
Adults cringe.

567
00:24:24,523 --> 00:24:25,842
They look away.

568
00:24:28,601 --> 00:24:30,241
I didn't want my friends...

569
00:24:31,558 --> 00:24:33,890
I d--i didn't want them

570
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,649
To ever have any reason to look away.

571
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:38,505
They didn't look away.

572
00:24:39,589 --> 00:24:40,228
Your friends,

573
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:42,531
They didn't cringe, not one of them.

574
00:24:43,322 --> 00:24:45,468
They didn't look away. You looked away.

575
00:24:45,488 --> 00:24:47,787
You didn't trust them. you looked away from them.

576
00:24:48,633 --> 00:24:52,141
Look, let us call them. they flew all the way here.

577
00:24:52,161 --> 00:24:54,601
Just let us call them back. It's not too late.

578
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,692
If you want this surgery, dave,

579
00:24:58,587 --> 00:25:00,458
You gotta give 'em a chance.

580
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:06,243
Oh, uh, chief?

581
00:25:07,981 --> 00:25:08,914
Dr. Bailey.

582
00:25:09,531 --> 00:25:10,743
Ooh. how's your mood?

583
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:14,442
Eager. Anxious.

584
00:25:14,462 --> 00:25:16,908
Uh, I'm excited about Sloan's face transplant.

585
00:25:16,928 --> 00:25:18,984
I'm a little concerned about Derek shepherd,

586
00:25:19,004 --> 00:25:21,302
- But, you know, all in all  - Do I look like a therapist?

587
00:25:21,764 --> 00:25:22,845
You asked.

588
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:27,535
I've lost Hunt and Torres.

589
00:25:27,811 --> 00:25:29,536
See, I-I sent them to get Shepherd,

590
00:25:29,556 --> 00:25:31,574
And I never heard from them again.

591
00:25:31,594 --> 00:25:33,963
See, I was trying to solve the Shepherd situation

592
00:25:33,983 --> 00:25:35,253
For you, sir,

593
00:25:35,273 --> 00:25:38,355
But it appears I've somehow made it three times worse.

594
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:42,099
So I'm telling you, and my next move, I believe,

595
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:43,494
Is that I'm gonna call the police,

596
00:25:43,514 --> 00:25:46,664
Because I'm half convinced they're all dead...

597
00:25:47,348 --> 00:25:49,867
On a spit with a one-armed man

598
00:25:49,887 --> 00:25:51,152
Turning 'em into shish kebabs.

599
00:25:51,172 --> 00:25:54,064
Sir, it's my mind, it just goes there.

600
00:25:54,389 --> 00:25:57,302
Don't beat yourself up. It's a hard decision.

601
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:59,418
Yeah, you've been with pierce for the whole year.

602
00:25:59,438 --> 00:25:59,943
Just listen to your heart.

603
00:25:59,943 --> 00:26:00,448
Stop thinking so hard. exactly.

604
00:26:00,468 --> 00:26:01,290
Listen to your heart.

605
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:03,188
Why are they starting late?

606
00:26:03,188 --> 00:26:04,846
There was a problem with the recipient.

607
00:26:04,866 --> 00:26:06,274
They've only got a few hours left

608
00:26:06,294 --> 00:26:07,574
For that face to still be viable.

609
00:26:07,594 --> 00:26:10,109
Oh, shoot. Sloan must be freaking out, right?

610
00:26:14,391 --> 00:26:16,453
Home wrecker. what did you just say?

611
00:26:16,473 --> 00:26:17,550
What? what did he just say?

612
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:20,709
- Guys, guys!  - Hey! you two, get out. you, come with me.

613
00:26:20,729 --> 00:26:24,045
Come on. hey, buddy.

614
00:26:24,273 --> 00:26:27,169
You need to start talking.You need to start talking now.

615
00:26:27,189 --> 00:26:29,397
I really can't. Talk to Steve.

616
00:26:29,417 --> 00:26:31,643
Ry-guy, you gotta start talking, dude... mnh-mnh.

617
00:26:31,663 --> 00:26:33,563
Because any second, they're gonna start

618
00:26:33,583 --> 00:26:35,368
That face transplant surgery, and then her good friend

619
00:26:35,368 --> 00:26:37,153
... my best friend.

620
00:26:37,173 --> 00:26:39,231
Is gonna have her very first solo surgery,

621
00:26:39,251 --> 00:26:40,263
And so...

622
00:26:40,283 --> 00:26:43,019
We have very little patience right now.

623
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,372
- Look, it's not my place  - okay.

624
00:26:46,073 --> 00:26:49,586
You are gonna tell me everything that's going on,

625
00:26:50,176 --> 00:26:52,603
Or else every time I have a rectal exam

626
00:26:52,623 --> 00:26:53,352
or an infected abscess,

627
00:26:53,372 --> 00:26:55,717
It's gonna have your name on it. every time.

628
00:27:02,772 --> 00:27:03,872
Megan was with Pierce,

629
00:27:04,315 --> 00:27:05,662
But they broke up for a little bit.

630
00:27:05,682 --> 00:27:08,738
While they were broken up, she slept with Steve,

631
00:27:08,758 --> 00:27:10,609
And then she got back together with Pierce.

632
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,244
But Steve Sent her an e-mail

633
00:27:12,244 --> 00:27:13,859
about how they slept together,

634
00:27:13,879 --> 00:27:15,457
And instead of just e-mailing her,

635
00:27:15,477 --> 00:27:18,037
He hit "reply all," went to a whole bunch of people,

636
00:27:18,057 --> 00:27:19,241
One of 'em was Pierce.

637
00:27:19,261 --> 00:27:22,151
And now Steve says he loves her. Pierce wants to kill him.

638
00:27:22,171 --> 00:27:24,915
Megan's, like, really freaking out, right? Because...

639
00:27:25,432 --> 00:27:28,093
Okay, wait, so a while back, someone sent

640
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:29,324
This text message, right?

641
00:27:29,344 --> 00:27:31,669
And, like, I didn't get it. I didn't get to see it.

642
00:27:31,689 --> 00:27:34,193
It just came to certain people's phones, you know...

643
00:27:38,042 --> 00:27:39,481
Why would they come back?

644
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,840
I was cruel. I was hateful.

645
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:44,620
You were scared. they surprised you.

646
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,780
You were in shock, and it wasn't what you were expecting.

647
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,840
You were... you were just-- I was awful.

648
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:52,810
You were scared.

649
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:57,290
And you were trying to protect them.

650
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,330
If they're your friends, they'll understand.

651
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:17,390
I didn't want you to see it.

652
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,430
This--this ugliness, it isn't me.

653
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,050
I-i didn't want you to see it.

654
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:30,950
This right here...

655
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:35,100
It looks just like the coryanthes speciosa.

656
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,010
You guys see that?

657
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,050
She's right.

658
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,530
The coloring's just the same.

659
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:46,960
If the surgery doesn't take,

660
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:50,600
If--if I reject the donor face, I'll be uglier.

661
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:53,480
I'll--i'll be even uglier than I am right now.

662
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:56,870
Please don't call my dear friend ugly.

663
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,490
You're a survivor.

664
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,940
And it's written all over your face.

665
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,380
What the hell is this? oh, this is not okay.

666
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:30,010
I have a hospital to run.

667
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,250
And, derek, what the hell's the matter with you, man?

668
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,500
We've all been there. we said that.

669
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:38,620
We've all had tough losses. he knows that.

670
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,850
We show up the next day, and we try and save

671
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:44,000
The next life. yeah, we covered that, too.

672
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,560
Okay, what about this?

673
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:49,060
Nothing we do can stop death.

674
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,120
We can hold it at bay now and then,

675
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:52,400
But everyone dies.

676
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:54,850
And that's not on us.

677
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,530
I took a pregnant woman in for a simple surgery

678
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:04,080
And I botched it.

679
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,740
That is on me. I should feel badly about that.

680
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:09,260
And you?

681
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,710
You should feel badly that while I was out here,

682
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,280
You sent meredith out here expecting a ring.

683
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,610
Why would you do that?

684
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:19,080
Why in god's name would you do that?

685
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,480
I... I was trying to help.

686
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:27,080
She didn't want to come.

687
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,750
I mean, she wanted to leave you out here alone.

688
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:32,140
I... I was trying to help, derek.

689
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:34,370
You were trying to help yourself, not me.

690
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:35,610
Yourself.

691
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:39,030
I hit the ring in the woods.

692
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,220
In the woods.

693
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,510
You destroyed me.

694
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:53,270
You'll place the facial graft.

695
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,750
I'll be connecting the vessels and nerves.

696
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,110
Get the microscope ready.

697
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,090
Okay, people, it's time.

698
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,870
You ever put a new face on someone?

699
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:06,630
Really?

700
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:08,830
I'll take the right side, you take the left.

701
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,580
Very gently.

702
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:14,140
That's it.

703
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,900
Take your time. he's not going anywhere.

704
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:16,780
Okay.

705
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,490
Watch the left corner of his mouth.

706
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,120
You're off center just a bit.

707
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:26,730
There we go.

708
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,160
Careful around the eyes.

709
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:32,970
Good. very good, dr. Grey.

710
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,210
- Get out.- no.

711
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,650
- Get out.- no.

712
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:51,570
- Richard!- no!

713
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:55,810
- Get out!- look, I've destroyed lives before,

714
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,770
Several in fact, and yours is not one of them.

715
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,880
I sent the woman you love out here to help you.

716
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:03,270
I sent the woman who loves you out here

717
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,730
To bring you back to your life.

718
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,810
If you ruined it with her, that's on you.

719
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,720
I don't accept it.

720
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:11,900
You're scared. you're drunk.you don't know which way is up.

721
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:13,310
You threw a punch at your best friend,

722
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,000
You threw a ring at Meredith,now you want to throw me out.

723
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:19,940
I'm not accepting it, because I'm older than you,

724
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,380
And I've been where you are.

725
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:25,740
You been drunk for a few days. I was drunk for years.

726
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,040
And I know you're gonna need at least one friend

727
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,780
When you decide to come out of that hole you're digging.

728
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,500
I hope you come out of it soon.

729
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:45,160
I'll be here when you do.

730
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,180
I don't think I can get her back.

731
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:54,150
Did you call her?

732
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,700
What am I gonna say?

733
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,580
I had an affair for years.

734
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:12,170
And when Adele found out, somehow she...

735
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:19,180
She took me back.

736
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,630
You can make your way back...

737
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,540
From anything.

738
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:32,860
This is year one of your residency.

739
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,990
You turn on each other now,

740
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,970
You're not gonna make it.

741
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:43,500
Okay, here's what's gonna happen--

742
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,360
All of you are going to go find the sense

743
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:47,680
That the good lord gave you

744
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:50,310
And never behave like this within the four walls

745
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,340
Of this hospital ever again.

746
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,720
You are doctors.

747
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:55,540
Pierce, get an ice pack

748
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:58,340
And put it on that oozing, disgusting mess of an eye.

749
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,960
And, Steve, go to the pit

750
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:02,190
And get that unsanitary

751
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:04,410
Bloody hand x-rayed and stitched.

752
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:07,430
And, Megan, you should go to o.b.

753
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,030
Because, yes, you are pregnant.

754
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,920
That was very Bailey.

755
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:18,750
You ready, dr. Yang?

756
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:20,380
Wait. I'm sorry.

757
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:23,820
I need one thing from you before I go under.

758
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:25,160
Now I haven't asked for much.

759
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:26,310
You haven't answered my questions,

760
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,160
And I understand that you're busy,

761
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:30,490
But I'm scared. I don't want to die.

762
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,140
I want to go on a tour of Russia with my friends next year.

763
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:35,850
I may just be a batty old lady to you,

764
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:38,380
And this may be a silly little procedure,

765
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:41,610
But I need you to tell me that it's gonna be okay.

766
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,450
You're my surgeon, after all.

767
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:48,810
This isn't a silly procedure, to me, ms. Sully.

768
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:50,650
And I will get you through this.

769
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:53,390
Thank you.

770
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:57,030
I'm ready now.

771
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:18,330
Izzie has stage iv metastatic melanoma

772
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:21,120
That has spread to her brain, liver and skin.

773
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:23,370
She may only have months to live,

774
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,080
And she's resisting treatment.

775
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:26,970
She needs help.

776
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:32,550
Scalpel.

777
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,720
No, no, don't try to talk, Dave.

778
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,790
It'll only hurt. you did great.

779
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,660
Can he see his new face?

780
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:55,960
I think he'd really like to see it. it's still early.

781
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:58,150
It's very swollen and bruised.

782
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,850
The tissue needs time to settle.

783
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,750
But yeah. I'll give you a sneak peek.

784
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,890
Sometimes we fail, but that's not always the case.

785
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:02,010
I know. blowhole has a new face.

786
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:03,830
You know, and what people call him

787
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,130
To get through the day is--

788
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,050
Cristina, I know.

789
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,430
I told Alex

790
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:12,180
And Bailey.

791
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,580
And they're telling Meredith and George.

792
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,590
Cristina--

793
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,680
No, I couldn't do my job.

794
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:20,010
I think you came to me for help,

795
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,050
And that's what I did.

796
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,520
Because sometimes we win, Izzie.

797
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,210
And I want you to fight, okay?

798
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,930
You know, for whatever that's worth,

799
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,630
I want you to fight.

800
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,500
Thank you.

801
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,600
Dr. Grey?

802
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,030
They think that you're taking advantage of me,

803
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,490
And they think that I'm using you.

804
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,300
But they don't know us.

805
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,190
They think that we're ugly,

806
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,640
But I know that we're beautiful.

807
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:32,930
And we can adapt to a hostile environment.

808
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,410
Thanks for coming.

809
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,970
Thanks for calling.

810
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,000
I love you.

811
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:57,230
I know.

812
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,800
Would you still love me if I wasn't a surgeon?

813
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,090
No.

814
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:19,430
No, because Izzie...

815
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:23,530
Has skin cancer that spread to her brain.

816
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,610
And you're one of about 20 people in the world

817
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,850
Who can save her.

818
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,020
And I don't know if I could respect somebody

819
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,940
Who could walk away from a gift like that.

820
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,000
So please don't.

821
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,740
Here are her scans.

822
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:48,900
It's pretty bad.

823
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,710
Practicing medicine

824
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:06,550
Doesn't lend itself well to making friends...

825
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:13,820
Maybe because life and mortality...

826
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,240
Are in our faces all the time...

827
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:24,830
Maybe because in staring down death every day...

828
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,720
We're forced to know that life...

829
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:31,420
Every minute...

830
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:34,630
Is borrowed time...

831
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,550
And each person we let ourselves care about...

832
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:53,750
Is just one more loss somewhere down the line.

833
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,300
For this reason...

834
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:05,820
I know some doctors who just don't bother

835
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,510
Making friends at all.

836
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:17,480
But the rest of us...

837
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,850
We make it our job to move that line...

838
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,320
To push each loss...

839
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:33,300
As far away as we can.
