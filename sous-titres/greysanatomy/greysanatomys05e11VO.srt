1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,520
we all get at least one good wish a year

2
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:08,010
over the candles on our birthday.

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,750
Some of us throw in
more-- on eyelashes...

4
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,210
fountains...

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,800
lucky stars.

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,830
And every now and then...

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,740
one of those wishes comes true.

8
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,170
Oh,I don't want to go to work.

9
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,000
It's warm in here. It's a cocoon.

10
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,870
No cristina with the mean face.

11
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,810
No lives to save.

12
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,510
A quickie? A quickie
will make me feel better.

13
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,670
Yeah,we definitely need a quickie.

14
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,530
so what then?

15
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,090
Is it as good as we hoped?

16
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,970
Do we bask in the warm
glow of our happiness?

17
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:01,120
Or...

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,400
do we just notice we've got a long list
of other wishes waiting to be wished?

19
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,470
-Happy birthday.
-What?

20
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,570
Yeah,thank you.

21
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,070
Okay,we gotta move fast,people,so focus.

22
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:20,760
Uh,o'mall,the pit. Karev,you're
with me.We've got a surgery.

23
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,400
Stevens,the clinic budget is due.

24
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,520
Yang,grey,wait for the
chief at the trauma bay.

25
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:26,000
-What? Why?
-Both of us?

26
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,310
Yes,both of you.

27
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:30,000
I don't know what. I
don't know why.Just go.

28
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,260
They're all silent rage-Y.

29
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:37,230
-What do you got?
-Take a look.

30
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,960
So what do we have?

31
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,400
-Caldwell-- as in
the prison? -Yeah.

32
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,920
-you've read up on our V.I.P.?
-yes.

33
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:50,940
Multiple stab wounds,badly beaten--
he'll have guards with him at all times.

34
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,770
Cuffs stay on,leg irons stay on.

35
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,670
Watch your syringes,sharps and pins.

36
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,680
I don't want any accidents.

37
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,510
and he's here.

38
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,030
You four are my team. No interns.

39
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,180
I want to keep this
as quiet as possible.

40
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,650
Get him in and out quickly,patch
him up and get him his way.

41
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:06,980
What's "P.D.R."?

42
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,660
Get him out of trauma
as fast as you can.

43
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,100
Those guards are going to
attract a lot of attention.

44
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,520
Uh,sir,it's stamped
P.D.R. What is P.D.R.?

45
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,750
Prisoner...

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,440
death row.

47
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,900
how's everybody doing this morning?

51
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,970
Mr. Dunn,can you hear me?

52
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,060
-You have a lovely voice.
-okay...

53
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,110
we need a trauma series.

54
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:51,420
Oh,I hate to be a bother,but
my-- my legs really,really hurt.

55
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,660
Was I stabbed in the leg?

56
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,110
we checked your legs.
We didn't find anything.

57
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,740
We should add t-spine
and l-spine filMs.

58
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,050
We're gonna get a C.T. Anyway.Extra
films are a waste of time.

59
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,200
Couple more shots can't hurt.

60
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,170
If I wasn't stabbed in the
leg,why does it fe like I was?

61
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,840
You know,the less you
talk,the more we can work.

62
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:04,600
Derek.

63
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,650
That's okay. He'll warm up
as we get to know each other.

64
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,390
-I don't think so.
-You'll see.

65
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,500
We're not that different,you and I.

66
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:17,130
People are alive when they meet
us,and then that all changes somehow.

67
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,490
Hi there.

68
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,330
What are you doing?

69
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,320
-I'm saying hello.
-Listen...

70
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,670
my best friend made
one simple request--

71
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,320
that I not get anywhere
near you--and I slipped.

72
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,330
It was fantastic. You're fantastic.

73
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,380
But it's not gonna happen again... ever.

74
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,670
Okay.

75
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,680
Damn it!

76
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,870
Yep,I think you broke your hip.

77
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,760
Are you kidding me?

78
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,780
-Come on.
-Who are you talking to?

79
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,530
Last month,I tripped on the
sidewalk and I cracked a rib.

80
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,540
In april,I fell in the
shower and I broke my arm.

81
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,900
January? Broke two fingers doing yoga.

82
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,490
Yoga. This is my sixth break in a year.

83
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:16,440
And so I stare at the heavens,

84
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,200
and without any belief in a higher power
but a desperate need to blame someone,

85
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,780
I yell "come freakin' on.

86
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:25,690
Okay,tell you what? How about we
call ortho,have 'em run a few tests?

87
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,510
Might be a little more satisfying
than shouting to the heavens.

88
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:29,870
Thank you.

89
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,090
jackson prescott!

90
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,050
You shot up again?

91
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,650
-No,I didn'T.
-Well,then why do you look so big?

92
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:44,650
-'Cause you're short.
-I've always been short.You grew.

93
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,640
Dr. Bailey,while i check out jackson,why don't
you take melinda through today's procedure?

94
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,560
Yeah,no problem. Come on.

95
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,660
did you see? He looks more yellow.

96
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:58,760
Okay,Dr. Kenley's gonna check his liver function
tes look,before we start,let me explain something.

97
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,570
Jackson has had 12 bowel resections.

98
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,670
Dr. Kenley calls me
anytime jackson's here.

99
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,970
Now melinda is a single mom.

100
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:09,970
She works like a maniac to make sure that
that beautiful boy has health coverage.

101
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,740
Miranda-- don't
even start.

102
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,340
This is a special family. We
do whatever we can to help.

103
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:19,870
-It's really not necessary.
-I-- it is necessary.

104
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:25,010
-We'll take good care of your kid.
-Thank you.

105
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,270
Now let's talk about the surgery.

106
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,050
Are you gonna let me
have a lollipop this time?

107
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,000
My stomach's not so bad right now.

108
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,330
It's not? So how come I'm about
to cut a piece out of it again?

109
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:43,820
Give me onof the lollipops,and if I keep
it down,we don't have to dothe operation.

110
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,860
I'm not sure that's gonna...

111
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,870
I'm not...

112
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,030
-I'M...
-Dr. Kenley?

113
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,350
Jackson,hit the blue button.

114
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,270
Right behind you--
hit the blue button.

115
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:01,900
Oh,my god.

116
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,820
-What happened?
-he just fell over.

117
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,590
***

118
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,380
I have some bad news.

119
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,640
It looks like jordan kenley
just had a massive coronary.

120
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,690
He was gone before he hit the deck.

121
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,240
Uh,his wife's on the way.

122
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:29,300
She'll probably want to speak to
you,the wife,hear something reassuring--

123
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:34,710
he'll be missed,honored
colleague,uh...decades of service.

124
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,800
Sir,you in there?

125
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,700

Si--

126
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,140
I have to tell alex about us.

127
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,590
Uh,"us" us?

128
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,150
No.That's a-- that's a bad
idea. Thats monumentally bad.

129
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,700
It's not fair. You know about him.

130
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:02,440
Yeah,and I don't like it. And
if I could off him,I would.

131
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:07,100
But he's the moody,broody one,whereas
I am the mature and-- dead.

132
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,010
You're dead.

133
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,850
I'm alive,and he's alive,and
I'm happy wh I'm with him.

134
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,400
Don't you want me to be happy?

135
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,690
Iz,there isn't anything in
this universe that I want more.

136
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,720
Then why can't I have you both?
'Cause that's what makes me happy.

137
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,420
He's gonna think you're a whack job.

138
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,990
He told me...

139
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,730
that he loves me.

140
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:36,060
That's a huge deal for him.
The least I can do is be honest.

141
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,810
Sorry about your doc.

142
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,400
Whatever.

143
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,910
Dr. Kenley was gonna sign
this,before he died and everything.

144
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,200
-Can you?
-What is it?

145
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,950
I want to get a wish
from the wish people.

146
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,630
You have to have a doctor sign it.

147
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:00,350
No. I'm not signing that.

148
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,030
Don't look at her. She's
not gonna sign it either.

149
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:04,840
Come on.

150
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,850
Look,if you sign,you
can help me pick my wish.

151
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:13,190
These are the ones kids have already done,like
go on a circus trapeze or be in a rodeo.

152
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,070
Just put stars by the ones you think would
be cool and x's by the ou s yothink are lame.

153
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,980
There's no way kenley
was gonna sign that.

154
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,140
That's for kids with
life-threatening diseases.

155
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,230
You're not dying. You're just sick.

156
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,740
Dude...

157
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:30,390
the rodeo smells like horse
crap. You're not missing anything.

158
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:37,150
I think... we've got a parathyroid
tumor for you to remove.

159
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:37,910
-Really?
-Yeah.

160
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:39,870
Did I just hear tumor removal?

161
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,630
I--my resident abandoned
me. Do you need any help?

162
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,850
-Sure.
-No.

163
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,440
Or... fine.

164
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,100
But you'll watch. You're
not touching anything.

165
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,770
Get it? No touching.

166
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:55,320
uh,she's up in ultrasound. Call
and see if they took her yet.

167
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,030
You slept with her?

168
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,100
Absolutely not.

169
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,850
Only once.

170
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,470
She came to my hotel room,took off
all her clothes and said "teach me.

171
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,000
" it was like I had no control.
She violated me with her nakedness.

172
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,150
Derek's gonna kill me.

173
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,520
Well,you shouldn't have
been alone with her.

174
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,220
Never gonna happen again,mind-blowingly
fantastic as it was.

175
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:22,170
Hey,you... are a professional,all right?

176
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,280
Oh,hold on.

177
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,150
hold tight.

178
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,090
Just a bit of lint.

179
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:32,610
Um,ultrasound's backed up,but they said
they'll have results in half an hour.

180
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,550
All right. Uh,well,tell,uh,tell grey.

181
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:40,650
Uh,and,um,let,uh,let,uh,george--
Dr. George--

182
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:45,200
Dr. O'malley know when,uh,let him
know-- let him know when you know,okay?

183
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,400
You were saying something
about professionalism.

184
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,020
Well,uh,did,uh,did you see that?

185
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,940
That--that was not
in my head,right?

186
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,710
I'm telling you,these
interns are out of control.

187
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:59,020
-stalkers.
-Sexed-up stalkers.

188
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,240
Dr. Bailey.

189
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,860
A arizonrobbins.

190
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:06,150
-I'm taking over Dr. Kenley's patients.
-You're the peds surgeon?

191
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,340
Yeah,I see you're assisting
with jackson prescott.

192
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,470
You know,all due respect to Dr.
Kenley-- he was a wonderful physician--

193
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,320
but,you know,I'm surprised that he followed
this course of treatment for so long

194
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,690
when it wasn't,you know,working.

195
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,730
Oh,no. I'm t criticizing you.
I mean,you didn't make the call.

196
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,220
Yeah,but I supported the call.

197
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:27,360
Be--we hadn't turned the corner yet,but kenley
was sure that if we kept doing what we were doing--

198
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,110
jack's case is quite severe.

199
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,270
-Jackson.
-excuse me?

200
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:36,730
Jackson is his name,and if you're suggesting that
we were torturing him with useless procedures--

201
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:41,940
a lot of senior peds surgeons believe that
stricturoplasty works,and sometimes they're right.

202
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:47,050
Yeah-- so we'll go with it today,but with his liver
disease,we should start exploring other options.

203
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,810
I gotta run. Dr. Kenley
had a big caseload.

204
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,490
I'll see you in the O.R.

205
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:58,960
He's still in a lot of
pain. I'm not sure why.

206
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,800
It would help if we could
get him off this backboard.

207
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,070
Shouldn't we wait for his x-rays?

208
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,440
He's got decreased sensation
in his right lower extremity.

209
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:07,390
According to him. He
could tell you anything.

210
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,620
We pushed 10 of morphine. He
shouldn't be in this much pain.

211
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,530
Maybe we could push a teeny bit more?

212
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,510
You know,uh,we're not
hereto feed your drug habit.

213
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,870
I've been behind bars for 11 years.

214
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:18,750
The drug trade in solitary
isn't what one would hope.

215
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,100
Let's just wait for the filMs.

216
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,100
No,I-I think this is a waste of time.

217
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:25,470
I hate to agree with
yang,but I agree with yang.

218
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,340
Dr. Grey?

219
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,130
Dr. Shepherd.

220
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,590
What's that?

221
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,180
Whatever they stabbed him
with is still in there.

222
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,280
-in his back?
-Spine.

223
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,830
Uh,does that mean,uh,I'm paralyzed?

224
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:53,200
my--my execution date is in a
week. I've exhausted all my appeals.

225
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,880
But I-if I'm paralyzed,my lawyer might be
able to make a case for staying my execution.

226
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:01,660
Do you think you could let me be a gimp?

227
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,700
No.

228
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,210
***

229
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,420
Is the chief in there?
I need to see him.

230
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,550
So do I. We're both
gonna be disappointed.

231
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,760
Well,what exactly is he doing in there?

232
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:25,070
Ever since he heard about jordan kenley,
he's been in there,and he wants to be alone.

233
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,810
I need to see...

234
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,500
it's impinging on the spinal cord. I can't
tell if it's going through or not,though.

235
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:37,330
Well,we'll get a better picture
once we get the C.T.S back.

236
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,910
I ordered an M.R.I. The C.T. May
not give us a clear view of the cord.

237
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,810
We'll be happy to lookat all the images.

238
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,280
And we'll do everything by the book.

239
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,080
I don't want some lawyer keeping him alive on the
basis that we did not give him the standard of care.

240
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,400
-You're pro-death penalty?
-I'm pro-punishment.

241
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:53,100
well,good people do bad
things. People screw up.

242
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,440
He's still a person.

243
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:55,710
We don't know what crime he committed.

244
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,410
Oh,uh,maybe he killed a cop. Let's
feel all warm for the cop killer.

245
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,680
We don't know what he
did. We can't judge.

246
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:04,100
No,but a jury
can.Death row--

247
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:06,110
I can't believe we're
wasting time debating this.

248
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,880
Do a repeat crit,and let
me know if he needs blood.

249
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,280
I thought they were friends.

250
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:15,610
-They were.
-And now?

251
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:19,330
Now you and I are in
for a very,very long day.

252
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,130
The annoying twins got a mass murderer.

253
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,670
Think one of 'em will pay
the guy to off the other?

254
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,200
no. If they're gonna get violent,they'll
probably just do it themselves.

255
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,090
It's weird,right,them fighting?

256
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,200
Yeah.

257
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:35,970
there's something that I need to talk
to you about,and it's gonna sound weird.

258
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,020
And I want you to know
that I know it soundseird.

259
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:40,580
So just don't freak out.

260
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,640
-You breaking up with me?
-No,not at all.

261
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,170
Though that's not a bad idea.

262
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,150
I see denny... a lot lately...

263
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,690
um,around here and at the house.

264
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:54,750
Are you okay? 'Cause that
sounds kind of whacked.

265
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:55,920
Aw,what'd I tell you.

266
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:58,790
Come on. You never saw your
grandmother after she died?

267
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:03,770
Yeah. I mean,she showed up in a dream and
told me not to play with the parts,but...

268
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,950
well... it's kinda like that.

269
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,980
-Excuse me?
-All right.Whatever.

270
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,710
-That's it?
-I don't know.

271
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,880
Tell him I said hi.

272
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,730
Kinda like his grandmother telling
him not to-- okay,so I panicked.

273
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,670
Mr. Dunn,are you feeling any better?

274
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,650
Uh,everybody's been so attentive.

275
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,670
I'm still in a lot of pain.

276
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,610
Well,wee gonna get that thing out
of your back as soon as we can.

277
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,780
you're on the cord.

278
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,440
She'S...

279
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,000
she's kind of a bitch.

280
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,330
Not--not to use coarse
language,but she is.

281
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,520
Well,she's my friend.

282
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:49,380
-Real?
-We had a fight.

283
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:54,410
uh,Mr. Dunn,it will really help
us when we take it out if,uh,

284
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:56,070
we know what that thing in your back is.

285
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,300
I'm pretty sure it was a toothbrush

286
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:02,780
and somebody snapped the head off and
melted it down till it was less toothbrush...

287
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,720
and more knife.

288
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,650
How did it end up in your spine?

289
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,180
Got in a fight with a friend.

290
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,030
hey,lady.

291
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,020
Can you help me?

292
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,540
Sure.

293
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,360
-You feeling okay?
-Yeah.

294
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:30,180
You see,I'm gonna get a wish from the wish people,but
I'm having trouble deciding which wish to pick,

295
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,470
so I'm getting people's opinions.

296
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,390
You know,put stars by the ones you like
and x's by the ones you think are lame.

297
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,550
-Then youtoave sign something.
-Okay.

298
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,270
ooh,how about a trip to
china? That sounds cool.

299
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:43,550
I get airsick.

300
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,710
The rodeo. How about the rodeo?

301
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,480
Some guy said it smells like poo.

302
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,290
What the hell are you doing?

303
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,050
Stars and x's,dude.
We're picking wishes.

304
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:54,470
He's not even eligible.
You're a little scammer.

305
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,650
You're fake dying?

306
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:59,790
-I want to go to the rodeo.
-Well,you just told me it smells like poo.

307
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,370
Nice try.

308
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,040
Come on. Let's get you
prepped for surgery.

309
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,630
You told him. He knows.

310
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,250
Stop worrying.

311
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,400
You've got a tumor on a
little gland in your neck.

312
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,930
Come...on.

313
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:27,310
She does that. Margaret,uh,the tumor's
benign,and it's not hard to remove.

314
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,570
Dr. Harris.

315
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:32,350
A parathyroid tumor tells your body
to leech the calcium out of your bones.

316
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:34,140
That's why you've had so many fractures.

317
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:36,730
Once we take the tumor
out,you'll be back to normal.

318
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:41,820
Come on!

319
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,290
Margaret,this is good news.

320
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,780
I've been living like an old lady.

321
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:49,190
I don't takehe stairs,I
gave up running,skiing.

322
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,010
I sit and I knit and I hope that the knitting
doesn't break a finger-- all because of a tumor?

323
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,820
A tumor that's benign
and easy to remove.

324
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,260
Come on!

325
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,720
There was a guy.

326
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:07,010
I fell in love with
the most amazing guy.

327
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:12,050
He was sweet,kind-- best sex of my
life,and he had to move to denver,

328
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:16,890
and he wanted me to move with him,and
I didn't because denver is icy.

329
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,990
There were too many ways
for me to slip and fall.

330
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:23,060
So I lose my guy and I break all
these bones from a bone-sucking tumor?

331
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,870
Are you kidding me?

332
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,860
Sorry. From the lab,Dr. Sloan.

333
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,710
did you need something else?

334
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:39,060
-this is torture.
-focus.

335
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,030
Okay,karev,can you
pull the retractor more?

336
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:44,110
-What,like that?
-Yeah,great.

337
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:48,790
Damn. Look at this. It's a mess.

338
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:51,180
He's gonna have maybe 10 centimeters
of bowel when we're done here.

339
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,500
Can't we try a bianchi
procedure,see if we can save more it?

340
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,060
The bowel's dead and
the liver's cirrhotic.

341
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,430
I mean,there's no saving anything.

342
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:02,100
-Yeah,but we-- Dr. Bailey,this kid should've
been on a transplant list a year ago.

343
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:04,290
I mean,it's a miracle he's still alive.

344
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,490
***

345
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,390
what are youoing?

346
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,680
I'm not seeing anyone today,bailey.

347
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,790
Well,I know that,but this is important.

348
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,970
Every conversation I have is important.

349
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:30,160
Kenley has been replaced with an
infant on roller skates named arizona

350
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:33,990
who didn't have sense enough to change her name to
something other than arizona,which shows poor judgment,

351
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:38,290
as does her diagnosis of a patient that
I've been working with for three years.

352
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,800
She's completely changing kenley's
treatment protocol based on,

353
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,270
like,half an hour of
experience with the child.

354
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:49,250
I mean,we just took out most of his bowel,and
instead of trying to salvage what he has left,

355
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,470
she just wants to throw up her
hands and pray for a transplant.

356
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:55,080
Look,the child hasn't
eaten solid food in months.

357
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,820
He--he hasn't
grown in years.

358
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:00,040
His liver is shot. It is a serious case.

359
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,130
Now we need someone who can handle it.

360
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:05,470
Dr. Bailey...

361
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,440
you thought shepherd was just a haircut.

362
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,540
You didn't like hahn.

363
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:15,470
and you think Dr. Sloan is A... hussy.

364
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,450
Can you name any attending
that you thought was good?

365
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:25,010
I've always been a fan of your work.

366
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:30,160
Arizona robbins was top
of her class,like you.

367
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,700
And she was chief resident,like you.

368
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:36,200
And she's the best anyone's seen
in a long time,just like you.

369
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:38,620
She is who we have. We
don't have anyone else.

370
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,370
Deal with it.

371
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,340
what's that for?

372
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:01,410
Seems like you're short of a friend
today,so I thought I'd fill in.

373
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,260
Whatever. Colleagues aren't
friends.They're competitors.

374
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,860
So does that mean you're
not gonna drink this coffee?

375
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:10,050
No,ll... I'll drink the coffee.

376
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:15,900
M.R.I.--He's got brain contusions
on top of everything else.

377
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,840
Mr. Dunn is still in
a huge amount of pain.

378
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:24,050
Can I give him more morphine,or will
that cause problems with his neuro exams?

379
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:26,230
Mr. Dunn has had enough morphine.

380
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:29,830
Right,but he's got a foreign body
lodged in his spine. It's inhumane.

381
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,320
No,killing people is inhumane.

382
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,720
Denying him painkillers
is a judgment call.

383
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:39,290
Derek... what's wrong with you?

384
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,240
I watch people die all the time.

385
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,300
I go to families and I tell them their
world has been ripped apart all the time.

386
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:52,330
And I fight like a dog to make sure that I don't have
to deliver that message,and I lose that fight all thti.

387
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:57,220
Then some guy like dunn comes along
and simply throws it away--life?

388
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:02,300
Then he's got the nerve to tell me that
he and I are two sides of the same coin?

389
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,030
You're not.

390
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,980
He doesn't need morphine.

391
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,900
she's exquisite.

392
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:14,380
And it's not just the
sex. We talked for hours...

393
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,780
-and laughed.
-It's just the sex.

394
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,310
Yeah,you're gonna tell me
you're not thinking about sadie?

395
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:22,880
nope. No,I cannot...

396
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:25,390
have another... stupid romantic...

397
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:28,140
disaster in this hospital.
It's embarrassing.

398
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,690
You do have quite a track record.

399
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,640
All right,you know what? we need to...

400
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,370
we need to fd something
else to think about.

401
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,730
worth a try.


1
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,850
nope.Not working.

2
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:45,390
Nope.

3
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,610
Ooh,okay.

4
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:49,210
We're like addicts,right?

5
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:50,850
We need a 12-step program.

6
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:53,150
I'm not going to a meeting to discuss my obsession 

7
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:55,210
with my best friend's girlfriend's half ster.

8
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:56,280
No,no,no.It'll just be us.

9
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:00,610
We'll be each other's sponsors,make sure we stay on the program.

10
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,670
What are the steps 

11
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:05,030
don't get naked with an intern.

12
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:12,400
It's more of a one-step program.

13
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,990
Maybe I should write this down.

14
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,070
Hey,cristina.

15
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,300
Can you mention that it's izzie's birday today?

16
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,390
Because someone should do something about it.

17
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:25,820
I mysepl am anning a party with balloons,streamers and a bouncy house.

18
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,690
Oh,that's a good idea.

19
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:29,050
But you know wha alex should do something about it.

20
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:30,010
I know,hosebag.

21
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:30,940
I got it under control.

22
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,900
Oh,a bouncy house?

23
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:39,450
Is he here?

24
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:40,990
Who?

25
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:43,840
your friend.

26
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,410
no,he's not here.

27
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:48,750
Well,if he shows up,tell him I'll share my girl but not my sandwich.

28
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,220
This thing cost 4 bucks.

29
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,700
oh,I'm done here.

30
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,310
The dude from M.R.I. Was all freaked out about death row guy.

31
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:08,190
Couldn't put his cuffs in the machine,so they had to vcro him to the table.

32
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:12,630
The tech thought he was gonna tear it all off and storm the booth like the hulk or something.

33
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:13,790
What did he do?

34
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,690
I don't know.I guess he laid there and had the M.R.I.

35
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:17,190
 no.

36
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:19,940
What did he do to get on death row?

37
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,600
Did he mow down a bunch of people with a machine gun?

38
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,940
Probably found his wife in bed with a hooker and a handyman.

39
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,240
They don't give you the death penalty for crimes of passion.

40
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,110
People understand that.

41
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,740
All crimes are crimes of passion.

42
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,640
There's always a reason.

43
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,400
People don't do stuff like that because they forget it's illegal.

44
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:42,480
When you kill her,is it gonna be a crime of passion?

45
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,970
that still hasn't blown over?

46
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:44,990
No.It's not a big deal.

47
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,990
We had a fight.She took it too far.That's all.

48
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,710
Wanna know what I think?

49
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:50,700
Not really.

50
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:58,000
I need to scream or kill someone,though I'm leaning towards killing someone.

51
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,320
Uh,working.

52
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,800
I'm feeling much better.

53
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,690
Thanks.

54
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:11,300
Thank you for whatever it was you gave me.

55
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:15,570
Is there a-a family or someone who should know you're having surgery?

56
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:16,900
Well,we can't call your family.

57
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:21,750
I think what she's trying to ask you is,what did you do to get on death row?

58
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:22,830
You don't have to answer that.

59
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,450
That was not what I was asking.

60
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:25,470
Well,I don't mind.

61
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:28,350
It's an obvious question.

62
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:34,940
One monday,I slit this woman's throat.

63
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:43,540
I had been thinking about it for a while,dreaming about it,and one monday,I just...

64
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,860
I had to do it.

65
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,840
I just...

66
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:53,000
really wanted to draw a knife across her neck.

67
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,460
And I-I thought it would be terrifying or...

68
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:01,270
or sad or something,but it wasn'T.

69
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:04,930
It was just...

70
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:07,430
kind of fun.

71
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,760
So I did twoore on tuesday,another two on wednesday.

72
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,770
I was nna go for three on thursday 'cause I liked the alliteration,

73
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:20,500
but I got caught so I didn'T.

74
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,140
Could I get some jell-o?

75
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:30,250
Or is that bad before surgery?

76
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,310
read the sign.

77
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,620
I was told to ignore the sign.

78
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,600
Well,don'T.

79
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,780
Bailey told me.

80
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,520
I'm gonna kill that woman.

81
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:57,570
Look,I,uh,I didn't know kenley all that well,

82
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:59,710
but it--it's gotta be tough,

83
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:01,560
losing a coworker you worked with for a long time.

84
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,090
Jordan kenley was a son of a bitch.

85
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:07,470
Great with kids,good with a scalpel,but horrible to his colleagues.

86
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:09,490
He was competitive,insecure,aggressive.

87
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:12,070
I won't miss him for a minute.

88
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,650
So...

89
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:16,340
is this about your mortality?

90
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,490
I'm not worried about me dying or jordan kenley dying.

91
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,600
I'm worried about my hospital dying.

92
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,190
I made some calls to replace kenley.

93
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,910
No one wants to come here.

94
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:40,310
I can't keep a cardiac surgeon on staff.

95
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:43,020
Burke quit.Hahn quit.Dixon's autistic.

96
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,770
My O.R.Roof collapsed.

97
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,130
The whole place flooded.

98
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:49,180
The interns are literally chopping each other into little pieces.

99
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,890
No wonder we're number 12.

100
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:53,090
12.

101
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:59,780
I failed at the one thing I spent my whole life doing.

102
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:03,060
Failed.

103
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:10,600
So I'm gonna stay right here on this table until I find a way to walk the halls without cringing.

104
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,600
Aren't you supposed to give me that rousing "get back on the horse" lecture?

105
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:27,210
I have gotta stitch a serial killer back together today.

106
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:30,410
I don't have a rousing lecture in me.

107
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:53,220
We're gonna need a strategy-- their hot little eyes tracking our every move.

108
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,320
Okay,no,uh...

109
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,920
casual glances over the shoulder.

110
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,920
No "this is interesting.Can everybody see?

111
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:02,280
" As soon as margaret's tumor is out,we'll have them take it to pathology to get it analyzed.

112
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,140
Right.

113
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,610
-Go,team.
-Break.

114
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,740
They still not speaking?

115
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,120
It doesn't look like it.

116
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,880
Two hours in an ice cave.

117
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,030
Working on seattle'sman of the year.

118
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,290
well,at least we got each other.

119
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:25,260
You know,we can pretend not to notice,talk about the seahawks or something.

120
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:28,760
Or we could just take off,go grab a beer,let them pull out the shiv.

121
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,730
Onward and upward.

122
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,970
I don't think I was clear earlier.

123
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:40,030
It is not like a dream.

124
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,600
I see denny when I'm awake.

125
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,330
We hang out.

126
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:45,260
This is because I said I loved you.

127
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,110
You're freaked out.

128
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,130
I'm not.

129
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:49,240
You're a little freaked out.

130
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,740
Um,we still...

131
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:55,460
do stuff together.

132
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:58,960
Sex stuff.I see him,and...

133
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,760
we have sex.

134
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,850
there's nothing wrong with a good fantasy.

135
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:09,060
I mean,I'd rather you fantasize about me or chicks...

136
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,650
but whatever.

137
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:12,040
You really don't care?

138
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,810
You're trying to work something out.

139
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:19,870
I mean,people die,and then the other people,you know,get messed up about it.

140
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:23,770
-Yeah,but-- 
-iz,I've been competing with that tool for a long time.

141
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:26,260
I'd say he's kind of got the handicap now.

142
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:30,740
I mean,is he here?Can he see me do this?

143
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:33,880
Yeah,dude.I can see you.

144
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,570
And this?

145
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:42,240
Is he still here?

146
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,750
I think you should go.

147
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:46,740
Yeah,I got things to do.

148
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,380
can you see him now?

149
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,460
No.

150
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,820
No,he's gone.

151
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:54,180
Don't stop.Don't stop.

152
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:56,870
-What about now?
-No,don't stop.

153
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,230
Sharp.

154
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:08,150
No wonder he was complaining so much.

155
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:10,270
He wasn't complaining after he got 10 extra of morphine.

156
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,580
He got an extra 10 of morphine?

157
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,470
Yes,and it made him much more comfortable.

158
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:16,470
It doesn't bother you that this guy probably hacked a family of four to death with a machete?

159
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:18,500
A knife,and women,not a family.

160
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,460
Five women.

161
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,510
It's what he likes.

162
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:23,400
You shouldn't even be on this case,either of you.

163
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,860
What's he gonna do,jump off the table and get us?

164
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:28,360
You're the one holding the knife.

165
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,220
We'll be doing a nephrectomy.

166
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,460
Either one of you ever mobilize the renal hilum?

167
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,140
Uh,I've never done one,but I'd love to try.

168
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,030
I've practiced on cadavers,probably hundreds of times.

169
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,600
It wouldn't be my first try.

170
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,000
Oh,well,to some of us,surgery comes naturally,

171
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,950
others have to practice.

172
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,550
You see the seahawks game last week?

173
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,820
You know,I am the jealous type.

174
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:03,950
I know.I'm sorry.

175
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:05,580
I can't choose.

176
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,450
Please don't make me choose.

177
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:12,080
Are you gonna make me?

178
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,760
I can't do anything that would make you unhappy.

179
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,930
You know that.

180
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:23,520
I love you.

181
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:27,510
That's what you tell all the guys.

182
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:32,180
You know,today is my birthday.

183
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:35,480
I do know that.

184
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,910
You gonna get me a present?

185
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:45,140
I think I just did.

186
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,550
Why is she shaking her head?

187
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:59,040
Jackson's post-op L.F.T.S.

188
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,500
This kid needs to beut on the transplant list today.

189
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,260
-Just the intestine,or-- 
-liver,too.

190
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:06,420
I think we should get another opinion.

191
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:15,100
norman mccale at hopkins.

192
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,460
Head of pediatric surgery.

193
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,560
Tell him arizona sent you.

194
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,360
When he tells you that jackson needs a transplant,

195
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,450
which he'll do about two minutes into the call,put him on the list.

196
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:24,250
Okay,there's no need to snap at me.

197
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:26,170
There is,actually.

198
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:28,010
You've been second-guessing me from the moment I arrived.

199
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:29,590
And I get it.You liked Dr. Kenley.

200
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,850
You trusted him,and I'm a stranger with a ponytail.

201
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,270
But I'm not the problem.

202
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,590
The patient is.

203
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:37,330
So how about you stop thinking about me and start focusing on him?

204
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:42,420
Jackson needs a transplant,and if we keep wasting time,he's not gonna make it.

205
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:17,320
You okay?You wanna get a drink or something?

206
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,080
Oh,now we're on again 'cause the mood suits you?

207
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,060
'Cause I'm the sad little girl with no friend,

208
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,180
and I tripped your savior complex into action?

209
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:27,810
-I-I don't-- 
-usually I can deal with the hot-and-cold thing,

210
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:30,050
but not today.

211
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,960
Just leave me the hell alone.

212
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,040
is that him?

213
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,260
You ever find out what he did?

214
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,360
It doesn't matter what he did.

215
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:02,500
He did something really bad,and he's gonna pay for it.

216
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,600
You want to get a drink?

217
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,830
I'm not in the mood.

218
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:15,920
You know,you and I had a fight like this once.

219
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,340
What?

220
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:20,060
Amsterdam.

221
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,660
We used to be as close as you and cristina,

222
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,550
and then amsterdam happened,and you shut me down,

223
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:25,850
and we never got past it.

224
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:28,930
We still hung out,but--but not like before.

225
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:32,250
We'd go dancing,go someplace loud where we don't have to talk.

226
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:33,090
And that's okay.

227
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:35,760
I'm a-- I'm a rolling stone.I bounce.

228
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,930
But you're about to do the same thing to cristina,and that girl mates for life.

229
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:45,000
If you don't make it right,she'll never talk to you again.

230
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:47,740
I apologized...

231
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:50,710
to cristina.

232
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:53,800
Like you meant it?

233
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,290
Like you could imagine she had a point?

234
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:04,290
I miss you.

235
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:08,320
As my friend,I miss you.

236
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,640
now transplants aren't easy.

237
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,720
That's the bad news.

238
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:19,470
But the good news is,you've got a crackerjack new doctor.

239
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:22,940
Um,I spoke to one of the most respected kid surgeons in the country,

240
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,750
and he thinks that she's the best there is.

241
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:27,500
So she's gonna take good care of you.

242
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,230
We all are.

243
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:41,500
Hey,why don't we go out and,um,uh,sign some of the transplant consent forms?

244
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,910
stars and x'S.

245
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,620
Looking good,margaret.

246
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,580
The surgery couldn't have been smoother.

247
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,600
when can i get out of here?

248
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,780
Soon.

249
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,220
You're young.You'll heal fast.

250
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,480
Eager to get home?

251
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,990
I'm going to denver.

252
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,720
we did good work today.

253
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,130
If we stay strong...

254
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,050
don't get drunk...

255
00:36:57,050 --> 00:37:00,430
keep staring at joe,we'll be fine.

256
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,240
Get you anything?

257
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,860
Okay,y-you're weirding me out.

258
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,840
You only live once.

259
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,830
You can't waste it.

260
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:21,900
No.No,mark.No.

261
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:22,970
Look at joe.

262
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:24,020
Look at-- look at me.

263
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,900
Look at me.

264
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,300
Sorry,kid.

265
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,290
I'm going to denver.

266
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:30,960
No.Mark.Mark,come back here.

267
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,240
No.Mark,no.

268
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:49,130
damn it.

269
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:52,320
Damn it.Damn it.Damn it.

270
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,850
You need another drink?

271
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:07,970
She's all right.

272
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:10,970
Arizona robbins.

273
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:17,390
I don't know if the patient's gonna make it,th--  

274
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:32,220
we don't wish for the easy stuff.

275
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:35,700
We wish for big things...

276
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:39,990
things that are ambitious...

277
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:42,870
out of reach.

278
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:53,370
Let's take a look.

279
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:20,260
two guys shot my dad...

280
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,080
for his watch.

281
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,810
My mom saved up for it.

282
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:27,580
Two guys came into his store,and they shot him 

283
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:30,680
because he wouldn't give it up.

284
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:34,180
That's how my dad died.

285
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:39,110
We are supposed to treat everybody the same.

286
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:42,320
But they're not all the same.

287
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,670
I'm sorry.

288
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:48,840
Just a bad day all around,I guess.

289
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,990
I wish I could make things better with you and cristina.

290
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:57,810
I wish you could,too.

291
00:39:57,810 --> 00:40:01,540
I tried to think what she would do in a situation like this,but...

292
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,740
I don't know.

293
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:08,170
Well,she would,uh,turn the music up pretty loud and she would dance it out with me.

294
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:10,890
But I don't think you want to go there.

295
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:12,230
Well...

296
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:15,920
let's see what we got here.

297
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,410
Look out.

298
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:26,250
Come on,get up.

299
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:29,790
get your ass over here.I'm not doing this by myself.

300
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,770
there you go.

301
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,590
We wish because we need help...

302
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:59,800
and we're scared...

303
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:03,780
and we know we may be asking too much.

304
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,700
Oh,my god.

305
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,460
You made it?

306
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,170
The cake tastes kind of funny but the frosting's pretty good.

307
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:13,630
It's beautiful.

308
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:20,180
it's a nice gesture,him baking for you.

309
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:23,130
Make a wish.

310
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,820
What if I don't have anything to wish for?

311
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:31,010
What if I have everything I could ever want?

312
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:32,960
We still wish,though...

313
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,800
then wish that nothing changes.

314
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,030
Because...

315
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:40,290
sometimes...

316
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:42,280
they come tr.
