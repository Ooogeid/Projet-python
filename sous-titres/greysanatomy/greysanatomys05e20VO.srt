1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,770
Previously on "grey's anatomy"...

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:06,660
izzie has stage iv metastatic melanoma that
has spread to her brain, liver and skin.

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:07,960
He threw the first punch.

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:08,960
I should talk to him?

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,560
Mr. Torres-- she's my
only little girl, george.

6
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:12,720
-The minute
you hurt her--

7
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,210
I'm engaged.

8
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,040
I broke up with owen.

9
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,920
defeat isn't an option...

10
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,900
not for surgeons.

11
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:33,100
We don't back away from the table
till the last breath's long gone.

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,720
"Terminal's" a challenge.

13
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,210
"Life-threatening's" what gets
us out of bed in the morning.

14
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,400
We're not easily intimidated...

15
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,070
we don't flinch...

16
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,130
we don't back down...

17
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,080
and we certainly don't surrender...

18
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,590
not at work anyway.

19
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,270
Does it bother you that
I don't want to wear it?

20
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,920
Because I...

21
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:39,760
I could.

22
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,730
I don't want you to wear
it. You' not a ring bride.

23
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,170
What?

24
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,630
I'M... not really A...

25
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,980
church-wedding bride or a
poofy-white-dress bride either.

26
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,380
We'll get naked and get
married in a field of flowers.

27
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:57,890
I'm not a naked bride.

28
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,440
What about scrubs? We
can get married in scrubs.

29
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,000
-Ooh, now there's a wedding I could get into.
-We gotta go.

30
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,170
so I told izzie she could
help out with the wedding.

31
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,570
Helps keep her mind off of everything.

32
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,820
And I'll tell her about the
scrubs and the no church.

33
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,540
I guess we have a
theme-- simplicity.

34
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:20,700
you know, maybe they could make you
a bouquet of scalpels and clamps.

35
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,990
Oh, yeah, that would be fun. I think
I would have to run it by izzie first.

36
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,330
Yeah.

37
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,960
I don't feel anything.

38
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,010
Nothing?

39
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,130
No anger?

40
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,050
Happiness?

41
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,470
Unhappiness?

42
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,310
Guilt?

43
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,640
Survivor's guilt?

44
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,910
You know, it's very
common with veterans.

45
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,250
It's not about my platoon.

46
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:09,490
You have shoved your
feelings aside for so long.

47
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,770
I'm asking you to claim them.

48
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,350
And, owen...

49
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,660
this is about your platoon.

50
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,540
it's about the fact that I tried
to choke my girlfriend to death.

51
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,190
What, are you saying the way I feel about my platoon and
the way I feel about what hapned with cristina are the same?

52
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,090
They're not the same.

53
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,530
Well, how will you know if
you can't name those feelings?

54
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,500
That's not what it'S...

55
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,120
it'S...

56
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,360
I don't know.

57
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,300
what do you mean, you
don't deliver dresses?

58
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,160
Just to try on?

59
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,510
No, no, no. I-I can't come in.

60
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,400
I-I have cancer.

61
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:47,340
I'm--I'm bed-bound
and dying.

62
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,830
fabulous. I will fax you my choices.

63
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,090
Hi.

64
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,120
Uh, what do you need-- blood,
pee? What can I get you?

65
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,910
No, just checking in on you.
See how the chemo's sitting.

66
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:01,650
Fine.

67
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,210
I haven't puked yet, and I'm making
major progress on mer's wedding.

68
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,200
You should really take it easy. The
chemo's gonna take a lot out of you.

69
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,570
I'll let you know if I hit the wall.

70
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,680
Hello. Hi, yes.

71
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,960
I wanted to discuss,
um, flower arrangements.

72
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,080
she needs to save her energy.

73
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,690
This isn't just chemo.
It's high-dose I.L.-2.

74
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,950
It's designed to make
the body attack itself.

75
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,280
she's walking around now,
but it's not gonna last.

76
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:26,550
Her blood pressure's gonna tank, she'll
be shaking with chills, she'll be nauseous.

77
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:29,070
She might even have a heart attack.

78
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:33,830
believe me, a few hours from now...

79
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,250
izzie stevens is gonna
wish she were dead.

83
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,590
hey, he here yet?

84
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:52,080
If you're talking about calliope's
dad, then the answer is, I don't know.

85
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,250
'Cause I'm not going to meet him because we
just started dating and it's way too soon.

86
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,000
And torres is okay with that?

87
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,370
Yeah, he, her idea. The man's
here for one day, then he's gone.

88
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,200
No muss, no fuss.

89
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,330
run. Run for your life.

90
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,940
What do you mean, run for my life?

91
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:11,900
Dad!

92
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:14,540
Give me one reason I
shouldn't kill you right now.

93
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,370
-Dad, stop it.
-He committed adultery.

94
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,200
Who hasn't? I slept with
him before we were divorced.

95
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:22,110
So technically, george isn't
the only one who cheated.

96
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,170
oh, god.

97
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,930
Give me one good reason I
shouldn't kill you right now.

98
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,430
Mark sloan. Pleasure to meet you.

99
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,020
Dad, mark is just a friend.

100
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:38,620
I--I'm happy now, okay? I'm--I'm
dating someone now, and I'm happy, okay?

101
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,780
So you're dating again?

102
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,840
Well, that's good. That's healthy.

103
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:51,030
I'd like to meet this
new gentleman suitor.

104
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,660
Yeah. Yeah, no.

105
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,840
sh--they're pretty busy,
'cause they're a doctor here.

106
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,110
But, um...

107
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,290
you would love them.

108
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:02,310
You'll love them, because they're--
they're smart and funny and both handsome

109
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:05,950
and--and--and beautiful
and--and very supportive.

110
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,990
daddy...

111
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,160
please be okay with this.

112
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,950
Dad...

113
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,130
this is arizona robbins.

114
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,290
This is who I'm dating now.

115
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,710
And I really hope you draw the line
at throwing women against walls.

116
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,720
you paged me.

117
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,270
Driver's face went through a side
window. Thought it'd be your cup of tea.

118
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,260
Right you are.***

119
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,940
what do you got?

120
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:43,780
Anthony meloy, 32-year-old male pedestrian with
a left arm injury and ro rash to his face d torso.

121
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:44,920
Stable vitals in the field.

122
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,050
Landed on the street after
he was hitby the driver.

123
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,740
I didn't hit him. He
jumped in front of me.

124
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,950
Dan gates--swerved after he didn't hit
Mr. Maloy and sideswiped a telephone po.

125
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,320
He's complaining of abdominal pain.

126
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,980
Also, he has blood coming
out of his left ear.

127
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,520
He came outta nowhere.
It wasn't my fault.

128
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,510
You better give that son of
a bitch a blood alcohol test.

129
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,730
He was driving like a madman.

130
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,670
Okay, now he's just lying.

131
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,410
Oh, I'm lying? I'm lying?

132
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,480
Mr. Maloy, try to stay still.

133
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:07,480
There's no signof head trauma. Check
out the other guy, I got it from here.

134
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:08,910
let's go.

135
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,400
-Wait, I need to look at his injuries.
-When we're inside.

136
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,240
-Drunk!
-Liar!

137
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,850
-Pathetic.
-Ass.

138
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,110
I was just driving to the bank.

139
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,570
Next thing, this--this guy
jumps in front of my car.

140
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,320
Whack job.

141
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,980
Sir, can I get you to move your eyebrow?

142
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,160
I can't examine his ear.
Would you get out of the way?

143
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,230
-Could you just wait?
-Could you just...

144
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,470
free fluid in the upper left quadrant.

145
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,880
Grey, schedule a stat C.T.

146
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,560
How are you doing, Mr. Maloy?

147
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,600
My arm's killing me,
but otherwise, I'm fine.

148
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:47,910
He's got tenderness and bruising over his
humerus, but he's got good peripheral pulses.

149
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:48,780
We should do a full workup.

150
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:52,450
O'malley, check in with karev once you've
assessed, let him know what you find.

151
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:55,570
Wait. I'm, uh, reporting to karev?

152
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,820
He's overseeing the pit today.

153
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,170
-You good with that, karev?
-Oh, yes, sir.

154
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,930
I'll be in the O.R. If you need me.

155
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,030
Off you go.

156
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:09,100
Meeting callie's dad was so
not on the agenda for today.

157
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,060
I mean, he seems like the kind of man who needs a little
preparation before meeting his daughter's girlfriend.

158
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,650
but you should've seen the
look on his face when I--

159
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,750
okay, can you stop doing that thing?

160
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,570
-What thing?
-That "telling me your business" thing.

161
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,930
It's my day off. I'm just here to
watch you do the fundoplication.

162
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,130
You know what? I checked your schedule.

163
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:25,420
You worked a 90-hour week. You should be
at home sleeping or playing with your kid.

164
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,710
Okay, you can stop
doing that thing, too.

165
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:29,090
It's just that peds can be tough.

166
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,470
And it can be hard on a family.

167
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:35,140
Not mine. my husband is very supportive.

168
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,840
He is...

169
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,190
can't wait for me to
start my fellowship.

170
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:41,250
-He doesn't know, does he?
-No.

171
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,840
Why?

172
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,120
Dr. Robbins, it's jessica. She just
had a seizure.  She can't breathe.

173
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,910
She's got tay-sachs. We
need to get a mask on her.

174
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,070
crank it up to 15 liters.

175
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,650
I know, honey. All right.  Sit up.

176
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,460
You're okay, honey. You're okay, honey.

177
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,680
you just need to breathe.

178
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,840
Slow, slow.

179
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:01,090
That's good. That's good.
You're getting better.

180
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,950
slow, slow. Okay.

181
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,130
there's no blood in the brain.

182
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:10,400
Z.M.C. Fracture of the temporal
bone, ruptured ear drum.

183
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,110
Book us an O.R.

184
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,760
Uh, not so fast, Dr. Grey.

185
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,700
Mr. Gates-- the patient has a name-- also
has an injured facial nerve, which means what?

186
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:20,550
That Mr. Gates will
also need a nerve repair.

187
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:24,220
Does that take place before or after
Dr. Sloan's ossicular reconstruction?

188
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,940
-Before.
-Incorrect.

189
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,100
Because you'll have to explore
the wound for bone fragments,

190
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,490
not to mention reversing
his conductive hearing loss.

191
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,640
Which is why I need you to
book me that O.R. Now, Dr. Grey.

192
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:41,950
Look, if this patient has facial paralysis, it
won't matter if he can hear out of one ear or not?

193
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:44,000
Am I right, Dr. Grey?

194
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,570
-Dr. Grey?
-Lexie?

195
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,530
-Dr. Grey?
-Lexie?

196
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:52,950
-Dr. Grey?
-I think you both are amazing doctors.

197
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,320
-you said the car hit you while you were in the crosswalk?
-Yeah.

198
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:08,050
Look--look, are you almost done?
'Cause I-I need to go, all right?

199
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,270
Uh, no.

200
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,700
because, uh, we need to wait for
the police. They need a statement.

201
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,770
Is that really necessary? I mean...

202
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,770
I could just give you my name
and phone number, you know?

203
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,150
I just need to-- I just need you
to wait here for one minute, okay?

204
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,070
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

205
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,500
Alex.

206
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,060
I need to order a psych
consult for Mr. Maloy.

207
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:31,040
As walking when the car hit him, but the pattern
of his injuries aren't consistent with it.

208
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,630
Plus, he's acting a little agitated.

209
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,690
Maybe because he was hit by a car.

210
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,970
Or 'cause he has you as a doctor.

211
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Either way, you need to discharge him, because
we have lot of other patients with worse injuries.

212
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,310
If he leaves and he hurts
himself, it's on you.

213
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,900
Fine, get your stupid consult.

214
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,690
But if someone in that waiting room dies
because we don't have a bed, that's on you.

215
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,910
I hear congratulations are in order.

216
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:03,210
-What?
-The engagement.

217
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,800
Our very own seattle grace wedding.

218
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,350
I couldn't be happier
for the both of you.

219
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:10,430
Thank you, sir. Did you
have an assignment for me?

220
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,160
-Dresses.
-I'm sorry?

221
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:15,750
Stevens has transformed her
room into a bridal boutique.

222
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,880
So go, try on dresses.

223
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,690
That's an order.

224
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,130
-I didn't think you wanted to wear a wedding dress.
-I don'T.

225
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:26,280
How does he even know we're engaged?

226
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:27,550
Richard's my friend.

227
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,560
He's not the one that ordered the dress.

228
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,510
If y't don to wear a
wedding dress, talk to izzie.

229
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:35,610
Oh, yeah. As the chemo
drips into her cancer-y arm,

230
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:38,040
and she looks at me
with those cancer-y eyes,

231
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,790
-those cancer-y, wedding-loving
eyes... -be strong.

232
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:45,190
We will have bridesmaids in pink taffeta, and
you will be wearing a top hat and a morning coat

233
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,160
and somebody will be singing
"wind beneath my freakin' wings.

234
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:50,200
" You want me to talk to her?

235
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,390
Apparently a morning
coat is nonnegotiable.

236
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:06,630
Also, we have to make time
for ballroom dancing lessons.

237
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:13,480
just so you know, I wasn't
looking for a relationship.

238
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,080
Not with anyone
- a he or a she.

239
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,690
But...

240
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,870
it just happened.

241
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,470
and, uh...

242
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,200
it feels good with her.

243
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:27,550
It feels easy and, uh...

244
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,370
comfortable.

245
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,030
I'm saying I'm happy.

246
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:34,750
When have you ever heard
me willingly admit that?

247
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,170
When you lived at home
with your mother and me.

248
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,700
you were happy then.

249
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,600
yeah, well, I was 12.
It didn't take much.

250
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,890
You'll fly home with me today.

251
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,940
I'll talk to the chief and
explain the circumstances.

252
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,050
What?

253
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:49,170
No. No, dad, no. I'm
not moving back home.

254
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,340
Don't worry. Everything's gonna be okay.

255
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,980
E-everything
is o-okay.

256
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:04,470
Tay-sachs is always fatal in
children, usually by the age of 4 or 5.

257
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:07,290
She's 6.

258
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:14,370
I spoke to my friend who's doing the fund-raising for
jessica, and he told me about this place in mexico.

259
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,380
And they do experimental
stem cell therapy.

260
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,130
In a couple of weeks,
we'll have enough money to--

261
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:22,540
matt, jessica doesn't
have a couple of weeks.

262
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:25,910
I think it's quite possible
she only has a couple of hours.

263
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,790
We've talked about this.
We've talked about this a lot.

264
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,350
And now it's here.

265
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,820
And I know it's hard.

266
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,950
I know it's impossible.

267
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:36,680
But we've done everything that we can.

268
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,200
And you have done
everything that you can.

269
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,300
No.

270
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,210
No. Listen.

271
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,410
All we need is a little more time.

272
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:47,100
Look, okay, if you read
about these treatments...

273
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,680
I don't mean to insult you.

274
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,260
I-I know you've done everything.

275
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:56,490
I just need a few more days, okay?

276
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,480
I just need a little more
time. She's a fighter.

277
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,370
You know that she'll fight.
I just need to get her there.

278
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:05,180
Matt, she's not gonna make it to mexico.

279
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,800
And I am so sorry.

280
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,220
But the best thing that you can
do for her now is to be here.

281
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,170
No!

282
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:23,080
you don't tell me what's best.

283
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,240
You don't tell me. I will find a way.

284
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,100
I will get her to mexico tonight.

285
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,110
Shame on you for giving up on her.

286
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:33,870
Shame on you, Dr. Robbins.

287
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,920
get a crash cart. Izzie stevens' room.

288
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,870
Izzie.

289
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,600
what?

290
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,530
oh, my god. I'm sorry.

291
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,240
You should see your face right now.

292
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,180
It's your "totally freaking out" face.

293
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:11,500
re joking? This is a joke?

294
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:14,500
I'm sorry. I-I really
did need you, though.

295
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,580
Um, I have all these dresses here, and I keep
trying to page meredith to come try them on,

296
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:19,890
and she won't answer the page.

297
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,620
So will you tell her to come
in here? She'll listen to you.

298
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:30,730
you have damage to your facial nerve
and a broken bone behind your ear.

299
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,360
Which I'll repair.

300
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:35,140
You also have some bleeding around
your spleen. We'll keep an eye on it.

301
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,740
also, your ear drum is ruptured.

302
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,190
You might permanently lose
the hearing in your left ear.

303
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:42,420
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

304
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,120
That son of a bitch!

305
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,190
Mr. Gates, it's important
that you try and stay calm.

306
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,000
No, no, don't tell me to stay calm.

307
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,370
That son of a bitch
dove in front of my car.

308
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,350
He dove, like he was superman.

309
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:56,650
I mean, he had his-- he had his
arms stretched out and everything.

310
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,810
I was going to the bank.

311
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:01,370
I was just...

312
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,680
going to the bank.

313
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:11,650
if I show you the dress, you can never tell
anyone, 'cause it's bad-- really, really bad.

314
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,650
Okay, fine. It will
be our little secret.

315
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,340
photos are not secret!

316
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,040
Isn't there a tiara
that goes along with it?

317
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:32,900
Uh, oh, put it-- put it on
so I can get the full effect.

318
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,950
N-no--no tiara.
I told you simple.

319
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,820
It's, you know, buffalo
wings at the reception.

320
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,700
You can't have buffalo wings.
Caterers don't even do buffalo wings.

321
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,220
Iz, this is a small wedding.

322
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,330
Small.

323
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,700
And this is a big dress for a g wedding.

324
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:50,760
Don't you have a dress in your pile that doesn't
make noise when it moves or stand up all by itself?

325
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,630
You're getting married. It's a miracle.

326
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,500
Meredith grey, child of
darkness, has found someone.

327
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,260
Don't you want to celebrate that?

328
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,040
It's your day, meredith.

329
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:04,920
You can't just piss it away on a stupid slip
dress and a cheese tray from the grocery store.

330
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,280
that will just make me so sad...

331
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:12,550
and I don't want to be sad because I'm already
suffering through cancer, and that's sad enough.

332
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,690
Fine. Give me the tiara.

333
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:24,460
You're like a princess.

334
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,170
Smile.

335
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,980
***home. He's dragging me home.

336
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:32,680
Como si fuera una niяa perdida, como si yo no
pudiera hacer decisiones adultas sober mi vida...

337
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:33,810
and who I want to spend it with.

338
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,870
I mean... es mi vida!

339
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,170
Well, I-I can see
that you're very upset.

340
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,850
You paged me, robbins.

341
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:46,940
you're her best friend, and i
am at a giant loss right now.

342
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,390
Not to mention, the
very sick children--

343
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,100
go.I got this.

344
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,350
Stop speaking spanish.

345
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:00,900
'Cause I have to go to surgery in
a minute, and I don't speak spanish.

346
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:02,960
My dad is taking me home.

347
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:06,230
He's talking to the chief, and he's making
me quit my job and quit my relationship,

348
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,220
which he has yet to
acknowledge even exists.

349
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,900
What, are you 12? Tell him he's crazy.

350
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,040
You don't understand.

351
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:14,000
There isn't anything he
hasn't done for me, okay?

352
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,870
Nothing.

353
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,020
He's paid for my college,
he's paid for med school.

354
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:20,750
I have a huge trust fund because he doesn't want
me to worry about anything but being a great doctor.

355
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:24,860
I mean, the man has done nothing
but support me his whole life.

356
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:31,460
Well, supporting someone and respecting
someone aren't the same thing.

357
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,990
You need to tell him that.

358
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,740
well, look who's up.

359
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:44,920
Where's my dad?

360
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,600
He should be here soon.

361
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:48,470
How you feelin'?

362
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:51,920
You, uh, want some water?

363
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:54,440
I want my dad.

364
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:56,590
Oh, it's okay.

365
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,790
It's okay.

366
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:08,790
when my little boy is scared, you
know what makes him feel better?

367
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,790
When he rocks in the chair
with me. Let me show you.

368
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:18,150
Here we go. All righty.

369
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:23,970
Oh, there we go, sweetie.

370
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:31,040
See, he likes this.

371
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,790
He likes this a lot.

372
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,520
Got you the cheeseburger
you wanted from joe'S.

373
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,310
-Are you sure about this?
-You really okay?

374
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,190
Not feeling nauseous?

375
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,880
No, I feel good. I feel fine.

376
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,270
See?

377
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,580
Hi.

378
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,360
Oh, french fries. God,
I love french fries.

379
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,250
Meredith, let's go.

380
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,370
I feel like this dress is giving me
a mammogram. It's squishing my boobs.

381
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,620
-Let me see it.
-I'm taking it off.

382
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,900
iz, you okay?

383
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,430
-I think she's choking.
-Izzie?  Let's hit her with oxygen.

384
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,840
Izzie? Izzie, speak to
me.  Can you say something?

385
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,140
Izzie?

386
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,290
I'm not choking.

387
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,350
I'm joking.

388
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:28,470
Okay, you gotta stop doing
that, 'cause it's not funny.

389
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:31,830
It got meredith out of the bathroom so I
could see her in her dress, and it's gorgeous.

390
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,610
-Tell her she has to stop.
-Izzie!

391
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:35,410
It's very romantic. It's pretty, right?

392
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:36,150
Pretty.

393
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,080
And I see you've invited more
people to witness my humiliation.

394
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:43,170
No, derek and mark still aren't speaking to each
other, and we're heading into a 6-hour surgery.

395
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:47,900
So unless I can slip this cheeseburger
into a sterile area, I'm not gonna make it.

396
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,250
Can you please comeand talk to them?

397
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,150
fine. Okay.  You can go.

398
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,680
Cristina, will you help
her take the dress off?

399
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,860
I'll be in the scrub room.

400
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,970
Lexie just ate all of my fries.
Can you please get me some more?

401
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,130
Nice. The I.L.-2 isn't
affecting you at all.

402
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:01,610
The doctor said if we can find a way to get her there,he'll treat jessica.

403
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:04,750
Matt-- she's been asking for you.

404
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,610
hey,baby.

405
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:13,190
Guess what?

406
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,970
We're gonna go to mexico.

407
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,410
You're gonna love it there.

408
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:21,010
The sky is so blue and the sand is white and the water--

409
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:23,330
can we go tomorrow,daddy?

410
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:26,460
I'm so tired.

411
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:31,650
why don't you trade places with me?

412
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:32,960
She-- it's you she wants.

413
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,540
All I need is plane fare,then we'll be on our way.

414
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:51,020
B-- I can get someone to relieve you for a while

415
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:54,170
if you still want to watch me do that fundoplication.

416
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,970
I'm okay.

417
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,920
okay,before you guys go in there and start cutting on this patient,

418
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,650
you need to apologize to each other.

419
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:19,410
If not for the patient,for me or for lexie.

420
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:23,790
Look at her--her face is breaking out,her ass is humongous.

421
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:26,840
it's true.I had to get the scrubs with the elastic waistband.

422
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,280
If you don't apologize right now,she's not scrubbing in.

423
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,760
I won't,and you can't make me.

424
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,500
This should be a joyful time.

425
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,750
Your best friend's getting married.You should be the best man.

426
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,930
The chief will be my best man.

427
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:39,090
what?

428
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,740
Hey,is my ass really--

429
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:45,440
lexie,would you,you know,excuse us,please?

430
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:48,560
-The chief?
-The best man is my choice.

431
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,920
When are you gonna let go of the grudge you have against the chief?

432
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:54,410
Derek,the man had an affair with my mother,

433
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:58,870
broke up my parents' marriage and basically destroyed my childhood.

434
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:01,610
Meanwhile,you've been best friends with mark for 20 years.

435
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:03,990
And you're willing to row all that away over nothing.

436
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:06,330
So don't talk to me about holding grudges.

437
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:09,620
I'll get over mine when you get over yours.

438
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,770
Uh,what are you doing up here,karev?

439
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:22,680
Uh,I stopped by to see Dr. Stevens.

440
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,870
I'm on my way back to the pit.

441
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:26,660
What happened with the pedestrian?The cops talk to him?

442
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,860
I-I don't know.I-I-I don't think so.

443
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,280
You don't know?

444
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,810
That guy may have tried to kill himself.

445
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:33,300
I called for a psych consult.

446
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,600
You have a potentially suicidal patient and you're wandering around up here?

447
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,350
Are you aware that the guy that hit him is on his way to an O.R.?

448
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:42,230
He is in terrible shape.He may not live.

449
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,750
-I--
-quiet!

450
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,940
If that guy intentionally threw himself in front of that car,he should pay.

451
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:51,770
He should pay,so he better not walk out of that E.R.

452
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:57,430
Move faster,karev.

453
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,110
You asked for a psych consult?

454
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,450
Yes,I did.

455
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:04,630
Where is he?

456
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:09,030
Oh,crap.

457
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:10,250
wonderful.

458
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:11,440
-You've lost him.
-I have not.

459
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,070
Have you checked the waiting room?

460
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:17,820
O'malley...where's Mr. Maloy?

461
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:22,460
Psych was supposed to be examining him,and he's not my only patient.

462
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,990
nice.

463
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:28,070
You lost him.

464
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,740
Hunt is gonna love hearing about this.

465
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,920
You didn't even want e psych consult.

466
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,060
I don't get it.I just--I don'T.

467
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,250
I've tried to give you the benefit of the doubt,

468
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,520
and I j--I don't get what hunt sees in you,

469
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,460
and I sure as hell don't understand what izzie sees.

470
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,650
Oh,shut up.I'm the one who's tried.

471
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,380
Izzie likeyou,so I've tried.

472
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,840
I've tried to find one little ounce of respect for you,

473
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,330
but you're the one who lost this guy.

474
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:48,300
You thought he was suicidal,and you turned your back.

475
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,340
That's not on me.I'm done with you,o'malley.

476
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,600
I'm done trying to respect you.I'm done.

477
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,610
-What happened?
-We did A.T.L.S.Protocol,but he's,uh,he'S...

478
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:22,460
we inserted bilateral chest tubes,but he kept on bleeding out.

479
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,570
Then he started bradying down,so we pushed atropine.

480
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:27,350
I opened his chest when we lost vitals and found the jagged edge of a rib

481
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,620
protruding into his ascending aorta,so I attacheda clamp,

482
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,610
and I'm getting some faint heart activity.

483
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:32,370
You got an O.R.Lined up?

484
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:34,330
-O.R.Two.
-Good work,o'malley.Scrub .

485
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:38,470
-His,uh,aorta was looking pretty--
-we got it,karev.

486
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:43,840
we should do a middle fossa craniotomy approach.

487
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,200
Let's get some diamond burrs inere,please.

488
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,960
Don't bother.I ordered them before we started.

489
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,650
I may be irresponsible and untrustworthy out there,I'm not in here.

490
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,130
I never said you were untrustworthy.

491
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:54,160
You put the berlin wall up around lexie.

492
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,500
Well,meredith asked me to.

493
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:59,280
That's what people do when someone they care about asks them to do something--

494
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:02,690
they do it-- which is what you should've done when I asked you to stay away from lexie...

495
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:04,190
or addison,for that matter.

496
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,920
Oh,here we go.Addison-- the only note he can ever play.

497
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:11,420
You know,I was going to apologize for decking you 'cause I felt bad.

498
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:15,060
But now I'm just gonna play it over and over again in my head and really enjoy it.

499
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,620
oh,hell.It's coming from the pterygoid plexus.

500
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:20,480
-Give me a 4-0 vicryl,pl-- get me some 4-0 vicryl.
-Get me the 4-0 vicryl.

501
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,800
Get me a clamp.

502
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,210
you know what?I'm done.

503
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,510
I give up.

504
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:29,080
If I hadn't fallen for little grey,you would've found some otherreason not to respect me.

505
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,260
You always have.

506
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:35,770
To you,I'm always gonna be the charity case the shepherds had to take in.

507
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:39,380
-I got the bleeder.
-You threw the stitch already?

508
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,140
yeah.

509
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:47,880
do you know where Dr. Grey is?

510
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,540
No.Do you want me to page her?

511
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,590
No,that's okay.

512
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,780
thank you.

513
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,180
Mm- will you hold the retractor,please?

514
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:39,240
He'll need 3-0 prolene and a gore-tex graft.

515
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,210
I'll get it ready.

516
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:43,060
You're good at this.

517
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,120
You're thinking ten steps ahead of what you're doing.

518
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,560
Not many people can do that.

519
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,860
And the hairier things get,the calmer you get.

520
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,800
That's not something you learn.It's something you're wired with.

521
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,170
You chosen your specialty yet?

522
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:55,070
-No,sir.
-It's trauma.

523
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:00,510
I'm--I'm sorry.You want to take Dr. Torres home?

524
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:04,830
Now I recognize that,uh,my daughter's a senior resident

525
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:07,290
and you've invested in her education.

526
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:14,420
I'm happy to write out a check for whatever amount as a donation to your hospital.

527
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:19,560
In exchange,I would ask you to transfer her to st.Mary's in miami.

528
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,830
Uh,I appreciate the offer,sir,but,uh,with all due respect,

529
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:26,740
your daughter is a grown woman.

530
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:31,520
Does she know you're here?

531
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:37,230
you don't have children,do you?

532
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,710
No,no.No,I don'T.

533
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,640
No,you don't,no.

534
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,500
Because if you did...

535
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:47,080
"your daughter's a grown woman"-- I mean,that-- that means nothing.

536
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,610
She's my child.

537
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:51,940
It's like blood running through your veins.

538
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:54,290
You don't outgrow it,it never goes away--

539
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:59,070
the love,the need to protect them from everything-- from everything--

540
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:02,810
even fromthemselves.

541
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:09,440
They grow up,they move out,they change,become people you don't even recognize,

542
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,460
make decisions...

543
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,740
I mean...

544
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:19,330
and they think you don't love them because you don't understand,

545
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:20,460
but it's the opposite.

546
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:23,510
See,it's the opposite.

547
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,730
You fight for them,always.

548
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:26,970
You never surrender.

549
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:30,740
When your child is on the line,you never surrender.

550
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:35,170
I called eight organizations,and they have a wait list for emergency funds.

551
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,700
I don't know what to do.I just--I don't know--

552
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:42,420
Mr. Smithson,it's time to stop now.

553
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:46,130
Maybe if we just go to the airport,they'll let us on a flight.

554
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:48,070
I mean,people do things like that,right?For a sick child,they'll--

555
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:51,580
-Mr. Smithson--
-no!

556
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,920
Please don't make me stop,okay?

557
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,140
Please don't make me stop.

558
00:30:55,140 --> 00:31:01,750
I wouldn't want to stop,either,but jessica is terminal,matt.

559
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:05,440
In a few minutes,her heart is going to stop.

560
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,590
Now I can-- I can pump her chest,push all sorts of medicines,

561
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:14,330
I can put her on a ventilator,'cause she'll no longer be able to breathe on her own,

562
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:19,590
but even with all of that,she's going to die.

563
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:27,480
And the last person who will have had her hands on her,

564
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:33,650
who will have been able to touch her,well,it's gonna be me or--ora nurse.

565
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:37,170
Or it could be you...

566
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:39,520
'cause you don't want to miss this.

567
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:45,250
This next part-- she needs her daddy for this part.

568
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,120
daddy...

569
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:58,560
are we going to mexico?

570
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,780
yes

571
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,180
We're going to mexico...

572
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:30,100
where the sky is "blue" blue...

573
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:34,490
and the sand is white...

574
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:40,550
and the water is so clear that you can see all the way to the bottom.

575
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,750
we're going...

576
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:49,380
just you and me.

577
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:53,070
no more doctors.

578
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,450
No more medicine.

579
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:00,310
No more hospitals.

580
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:03,760
Just you and me.

581
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,410
we're gonna go.You just relax.We'll be there soon.

582
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:28,670
and we'll play on the beach all day.

583
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:32,480
And we'll make sand castles.

584
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,260
We're gog.

585
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,830
We'll be there soon.You'll see.

586
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:47,340
And we're gonna have so much fun.

587
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:50,460
just you and me.

588
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:53,180
Just you and me.

589
00:33:58,390 --> 00:33:59,680
98 over 72.

590
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,190
That's good.

591
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:04,130
Don'T.

592
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:08,270
Don't try and make me out better than I am,because I'm not.

593
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:09,990
I'm sick.

594
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:14,900
You had an incredibly high dose of I.L.-2 today.

595
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:18,130
This is how you're supposed to feel.

596
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:22,780
All I wanted to do today was flip through magazines and call caterers

597
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:25,890
and make mer try on dresses I knew she'd hate.

598
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:32,470
I thought it would be f-- fun or...

599
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:33,990
funny.

600
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:43,050
I thought I could be the same person I was when I woke up this morning.

601
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:46,030
But I'm not.

602
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,980
I'm just another patient trapped inside...

603
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:54,570
a sick,dying,cancer-ridden body.

604
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:21,270
what happened?

605
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:28,600
He,uh...gave me an ultimatum.

606
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:33,060
Said if I didn't come home,he'd take away my trust fund...

607
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:36,170
he'd cut me off.

608
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,350
So I cut him off.

609
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:42,960
I mean,if he can't accept me for who I am...

610
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:49,180
I cut him off.

611
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,930
Are you okay?

612
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,750
No.

613
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:02,310
I mean,yeah.I...I don't know.

614
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:22,010
I jumped...

615
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:24,100
in front of her car.

616
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,850
And she was just...

617
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,400
driving to the bank.

618
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,210
-We're talking about cristina?
-I jumped in front of her.

619
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:32,390
I knew.I knew I wasn't together.

620
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:36,800
I knew I was no good for her,for anyone.

621
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,400
And I wrecked her.

622
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,870
And that...is unforgivable.

623
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:47,880
I don't forgive myself for that.I can't forgive myself for that.

624
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:52,060
And I am feeling shameful about that.

625
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:59,660
That is what I feel today-- shame.

626
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,050
Good.

627
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:04,590
-That's a start.
-How is that a start?

628
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:07,210
You named it...

629
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:10,380
the feeling.

630
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:17,550
You have to know what it is before you can start to navigate to somewhere better.

631
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:20,160
he has a long recovery ahead of him.

632
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,510
He severely damaged his facial nerves,shattered his inner ear and lost a great deal of blood.

633
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,010
Oh,my god.

634
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:30,840
but he'll be fine.He'll be in some pain for a while,but,uh,he'll be fine.

635
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,490
Oh,my god.Thank you.Thank you both so much.

636
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:36,780
Thank Dr. Sloan.That kind of bleed--not many surgeons could've handled it.

637
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:39,750
He saved your husband's life.

638
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,860
Would you like to see your husband now?

639
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,940
Yes,thank you.

640
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,750
you know that's the first actual compliment you've ever given me?

641
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,670
It wasn't a mpliment.It was a simple statement of fact.

642
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:53,430
See,why do you do that?Why can't you just give a person a compliment?

643
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:55,330
If you have to ask for a compliment,it's not a compliment.

644
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:56,800
Are you asking for a compliment?

645
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,660
Then it's not a compliment.

646
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:08,060
Is there anything else you need before I go?

647
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:10,490
No.

648
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,460
Yowant to sit a while?

649
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,220
No,I do not want to sit.

650
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:18,470
I've been sitting and lying down all day...

651
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:21,540
-Dr. Bailey--
-holding a child.

652
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:25,280
If I wanted to spend the day holding a child,

653
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,580
I would have stayed home to hold my own child.

654
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:32,580
I didn't do a single medical thing today.

655
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,500
I didn't even put a band-aid on a patient.

656
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,190
I'm--I'm just tired.I...

657
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,240
I'm done.

658
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,320
Are you gonna tell your husband?

659
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:49,450
At would I tell him?

660
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:51,870
That it's more than just cutting.

661
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:56,120
Peds is more than just cutting.

662
00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:00,690
And what you did today was heroic.

663
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:05,890
And you know it.

664
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,810
Okay.

665
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,830
Maybe I'll tell him that.

666
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:19,060
To do our jobs...

667
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:23,940
we have to believe defeat is not an option...

668
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:30,460
that no matter how sick our patients get...

669
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:43,300
you're gonna make a beautiful bride.

670
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:46,420
There's hope for them.

671
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:25,810
You kicked ass today,o'malley.You kicked my ass.

672
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:27,340
I just did what I had to do.

673
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:30,950
No,no.You...you kicked ass.

674
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:33,320
I'm not like that.

675
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:36,190
I'm good,but not like you.I'm not...

676
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:39,430
good under pressure.

677
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:47,830
She's really sick--

678
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,070
really sick-- and I'm not good under pressure.

679
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:55,690
But even when our hopes give way to reality

680
00:40:55,690 --> 00:41:00,010
and we finally have to surrender to the truth...

681
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:02,710
it just means we've lost today's battle...

682
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,480
could I have another,please?

683
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,770
Not tomorrow's war.

684
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,700
So I guess a big wedding won't be that bad.

685
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:17,610
I'm just sad 'cause I didn't get a chance to see you in the actual dress.

686
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:19,740
-You will.
-How?

687
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:22,250
I mean,if derek and mark don't make up,how...

688
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,850
you're my sister,lexie.

689
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:26,590
You're in the wedding.

690
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:28,440
Oh,my god.

691
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,990
I'm gonna be a bridesmaid?

692
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:32,050
Oh,my god.I don't know what to say.

693
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:34,630
Well,you should wait and see what izzie's picked out for you to wear.

694
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:37,120
And then you'll have plenty to say.

695
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,940
here's the thing about surrender...

696
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:41,700
-do you want one?
-So much.

697
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,270
-Once you do it...
-we can still catch the last half of the game.

698
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:45,680
Yeah,that's-- that's what I was thinking.

699
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,940
Actually give in...

700
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:52,510
you forget why you were even fighting in the first place.

701
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:56,040
-you can stop eating now.
-Oh,thank god.
