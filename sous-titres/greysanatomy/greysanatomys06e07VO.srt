1
00:00:01,217 --> 00:00:05,610
<i>Ask to surgeon why they became surgeon
and the usually tell you the same thing</i>

2
00:00:05,692 --> 00:00:08,099
<i>It was for the high, the rush</i>

3
00:00:08,181 --> 00:00:11,858
<i>The thrill that's come from cutting someone open
and saving their life</i>

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,214
<i>- For me, it was différent.
- Take care of yourself</i>

5
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:16,849
<i>Maybe it's because I grew up
in a house with four sisters...</i>

6
00:00:17,103 --> 00:00:20,289
<i>No, definitely because
I grew up in a house with four sisters</i>

7
00:00:20,372 --> 00:00:23,163
<i>But it was the quiet that drew me to surgery.</i>
How you doing?

8
00:00:24,062 --> 00:00:27,624
Fine. Why, did meredith
say something to you?

9
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,546
She mentioned you were
a little down about the merger,

10
00:00:29,617 --> 00:00:32,179
- Lack of a cardio god.
- Your wife is dead.

11
00:00:32,275 --> 00:00:33,410
As soon as her liver grows back, she's dead.

12
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:35,536
Be glad she did.
That's why I put you on my service.

13
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:38,182
You need a god?
Neuro god right here.

14
00:00:38,753 --> 00:00:41,773
Godly? Your entire day consists
of putting shunts in people.

15
00:00:41,855 --> 00:00:43,320
Today? Temporal lobectomy.

16
00:00:43,392 --> 00:00:45,612
Our schedule for several months now.

17
00:00:46,001 --> 00:00:47,702
Hospitals across the country

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,083
Have reported
substantial savings...

19
00:00:50,193 --> 00:00:53,820
- How bad is it today?
- The chief's implementing a computer model

20
00:00:53,903 --> 00:00:55,914
For scheduling our surgeries
from now on.

21
00:00:55,997 --> 00:00:59,993
- Something about efficiency and progress.
- And to make sure this was the right decision,

22
00:01:00,072 --> 00:01:02,606
I have enlisted one of our own
to do a trial run

23
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:04,565
For the last month.
Dr. Sloan.

24
00:01:05,586 --> 00:01:07,213
I know
what you're all thinking.

25
00:01:07,303 --> 00:01:09,573
It's a machine.
It doesn't know me.

26
00:01:09,656 --> 00:01:11,185
It doesn't know what I like.

27
00:01:11,274 --> 00:01:13,166
But after using this new system
for the past month,

28
00:01:13,232 --> 00:01:15,170
I gotta say, people,
I'm a convert.

29
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,843
This computer knows me
better than I know me.

30
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,488
Tis thing has rearranged
my schedule for the entire week.

31
00:01:21,559 --> 00:01:25,860
- mean, haven't we had enough change here already?
- Change is good, everyone.

32
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,478
Embrace it.

33
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:32,286
You two need to stop bickering.
It's unattractive.

34
00:01:34,248 --> 00:01:37,741
<i>The operating room
is a quiet place, peaceful.</i>

35
00:01:37,846 --> 00:01:39,855
<i>It has to be
in order for us to stay alert,</i>

36
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:42,940
<i>- Anticipate complications.</i>
- Your ass is in my way.

37
00:01:43,023 --> 00:01:44,663
I was in the o. R. All night

38
00:01:44,746 --> 00:01:46,845
sewing a hang glider's
intestines back together.

39
00:01:46,944 --> 00:01:49,872
- I'm kinda sore.
- I kinda don't care. Move.

40
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:53,427
I just got a call
from swender's office

41
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,634
That izzie has an I.L.-2
treatment this week

42
00:01:55,717 --> 00:01:57,972
- That she hasn't called back to confirm.
- And?

43
00:02:01,302 --> 00:02:03,450
She's your wife, who could die.

44
00:02:04,046 --> 00:02:05,343
She'll show up.

45
00:02:05,453 --> 00:02:07,785
She's a crappy wife,
but she's not an idiot.

46
00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:11,046
It's Thursday at 10:00,
So you know.

47
00:02:14,364 --> 00:02:15,277
Don't worry.

48
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,442
Being ditched by cancer wife
won't change my mind.

49
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:19,264
You're still a douche.

50
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:25,054
<i>When you stand in the o. R.,</i>

51
00:02:25,137 --> 00:02:27,159
<i>Your patient
open on the table...</i>

52
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:30,458
<i>All the world's noise,
all the worry that it brings...</i>

53
00:02:30,995 --> 00:02:32,036
<i>Disappears.</i>

54
00:02:33,991 --> 00:02:36,203
Isaac, if you don't stop
calling me dr. Shepherd,

55
00:02:36,296 --> 00:02:39,356
- I'm seriously gonna have to cut you off.
- Right. Forgot. Derek.

56
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:41,433
- Thanks.
- I have your scans.

57
00:02:41,516 --> 00:02:43,608
I didn't order any scans.
I think they're for a consult,

58
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,701
- But I can come back if you're busy.
- No, it's okay.

59
00:02:45,784 --> 00:02:49,948
<i>A calm settles over you,
time passing without thought...</i>

60
00:02:51,197 --> 00:02:54,232
<i>For that moment,
you feel completely at peace.</i>

61
00:02:56,346 --> 00:02:58,432
It's a tumor on the spinal cord,

62
00:02:58,515 --> 00:03:01,407
Possibly a hemangioblastoma.
You've seen one before?

63
00:03:02,173 --> 00:03:03,436
Not this big.

64
00:03:03,844 --> 00:03:06,237
You see how the tumor has
worked its way up the spine?

65
00:03:06,328 --> 00:03:08,133
It's taken over
the blood supply.

66
00:03:08,874 --> 00:03:10,320
It's a perfect tumor.

67
00:03:10,461 --> 00:03:12,513
You know if the patient
still has leg function?

68
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,568
- Yes.
- Incredible.

69
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:17,526
He shouldn't be walking.
He should be paralyzed, dead.

70
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,578
You'd have to operate quickly,
then, to take the tumor out?

71
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,372
I'd love
to operate on this.

72
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:26,432
But, no. No, you have to
cut the cord,

73
00:03:26,515 --> 00:03:28,421
Paralyze the patient,
to kill the tumor.

74
00:03:28,532 --> 00:03:30,198
Who's thdoctor
on this one?

75
00:03:31,993 --> 00:03:32,753
You.

76
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,215
I'm sorry?

77
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,127
These are my scans.

78
00:03:38,872 --> 00:03:40,261
The tumor is mine.

79
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:42,776
I'd like you
to take it out.

80
00:03:43,228 --> 00:03:44,693
I'd like you to try.

81
00:03:54,141 --> 00:03:55,832
One doctor said
it was bad circulation,

82
00:03:55,914 --> 00:03:57,050
Another one, pinched nerve.

83
00:03:57,133 --> 00:03:58,978
But when the pain started
to interfere with work,

84
00:03:59,061 --> 00:04:01,005
I decided to run an m.R.I. on myself.

85
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:05,844
- Had I known this was your scan, I wouldn't have
- I have been to every doctor.

86
00:04:05,955 --> 00:04:07,653
Every time,
it's the same thing.

87
00:04:07,736 --> 00:04:09,378
They look at the tumor
and ey're defeated.

88
00:04:09,461 --> 00:04:12,375
But not you.
You were inspired.

89
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,516
That's why I know I was right
to come and work here.

90
00:04:15,618 --> 00:04:19,756
- I needed to meet you.
- You got a job here to meet me?

91
00:04:19,913 --> 00:04:22,869
I have researched every
neurosurgeon in this country.

92
00:04:22,952 --> 00:04:25,395
I know their statistics,
I know who wins the most prizes,

93
00:04:25,478 --> 00:04:26,628
But I also know

94
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:29,621
who takes the most risks.

95
00:04:29,752 --> 00:04:30,899
That's you.

96
00:04:32,943 --> 00:04:35,546
I know you believe
I can take this tumor out,

97
00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:36,734
And I wish I could.

98
00:04:36,817 --> 00:04:38,573
But this surgery
will kill you.

99
00:04:38,692 --> 00:04:41,280
Take the scans.
Look them over.

100
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:42,960
But stop your mind

101
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:45,054
Before the part
where it gets to "no."

102
00:04:46,377 --> 00:04:47,997
Think "yes."

103
00:04:48,148 --> 00:04:50,789
- Yes?
- I've been paging you.

104
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,560
Shunt patient, o. R. Two.

105
00:04:52,671 --> 00:04:55,608
Screw the the shunt.
Let's operate on that.

106
00:04:57,106 --> 00:04:59,233
You know what this is about?

107
00:04:59,349 --> 00:05:01,080
You're no longer
daddy's favorite,

108
00:05:01,144 --> 00:05:03,203
So you've gone in search
of some crazy ass tumor

109
00:05:03,301 --> 00:05:05,877
- To get his love back.
- Actually, it's about my patient.

110
00:05:05,963 --> 00:05:08,602
I haven't made up my mind yet.
I'm just looking.

111
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:10,371
Isaac has a cord tumor?

112
00:05:10,454 --> 00:05:13,872
- It's awesome. Look.
- Awesome in a bad way.

113
00:05:13,955 --> 00:05:15,740
It's eaten five levels
of his spine.

114
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,095
Wait, you're not
seriously considering

115
00:05:18,198 --> 00:05:20,184
- Trying to take it out?
- Of course he is.

116
00:05:20,326 --> 00:05:21,537
He's shepherd.

117
00:05:21,886 --> 00:05:23,576
It's a bad case a tough one?

118
00:05:23,661 --> 00:05:25,806
Isaac's got a bone spur
or a herniated disk, not a...

119
00:05:27,172 --> 00:05:30,284
He diagnosed an osteosarcoma
case for me a month ago.

120
00:05:30,378 --> 00:05:32,414
I thought it was a shadow,
but it turned out to be

121
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:35,376
- The tiniest little lesion on an x-ray.
- That says more about you than it does him.

122
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,584
I'm sorry. Do you
even know who isaac is?

123
00:05:39,363 --> 00:05:40,288
No idea.

124
00:05:40,785 --> 00:05:44,192
what's everyone... A spinal tumor.

125
00:05:44,276 --> 00:05:47,223
I read about a case at mayo
where the surgery took 17 hours.

126
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,390
The head surgeon had
four rotating assistants,

127
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:51,460
One of whom
just administered fluids.

128
00:05:51,543 --> 00:05:53,749
You know what? Don't try
and lexopedia your way on this.

129
00:05:53,832 --> 00:05:56,372
- This is my tumor.
- What happened to the patient at mayo?

130
00:05:56,474 --> 00:05:58,978
He died. That's why
it only took 17 hours.

131
00:05:59,078 --> 00:06:03,200
- I just heard. Isaac has an inoperable tumor?
- It's isaac's tumor?

132
00:06:04,402 --> 00:06:06,290
Who says it's inoperable?

133
00:06:09,805 --> 00:06:11,935
It's all the way up to t-2.

134
00:06:12,055 --> 00:06:14,217
- This is why is got into plastics.
- That's gotta be...

135
00:06:15,455 --> 00:06:17,793
Why aren't you all
at your surgeries?

136
00:06:18,417 --> 00:06:20,057
Go, get to your o.R.S.

137
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,188
Don't screw with
my schedule on day one.

138
00:06:36,762 --> 00:06:38,105
I haven't made
a decision.

139
00:06:38,697 --> 00:06:41,400
No rush.
I'm a patient man.

140
00:06:46,128 --> 00:06:49,616
Everyone said you'd found
the great white of tumors,

141
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:52,623
- But just had to see it for myself.
- And now that you have?

142
00:06:53,293 --> 00:06:56,516
You want
my flow attending answer

143
00:06:56,597 --> 00:06:58,556
- Or my fellow surgeon answer?
- Fellow surgeon.

144
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:03,178
This tumor idangerous...

145
00:07:03,732 --> 00:07:06,418
Complicated... And smart...

146
00:07:07,158 --> 00:07:08,032
Beautiful.

147
00:07:08,597 --> 00:07:11,305
This tumor is the reason
I got into medicine.

148
00:07:11,701 --> 00:07:14,871
To successfully take out
this tumor would be

149
00:07:14,926 --> 00:07:16,406
an achievement you could
hang your hat on

150
00:07:16,489 --> 00:07:18,097
For the rest of your career.

151
00:07:18,232 --> 00:07:20,867
You could retire
on this tumor.

152
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:24,185
<i>I wouldn't go near it.</i>
It's a beast.

153
00:07:24,323 --> 00:07:26,434
It's a malpractice suit
waiting to happen,

154
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,947
Even if we could get
his insurance to cover it.

155
00:07:29,276 --> 00:07:31,040
Did I mention
he was an employee?

156
00:07:31,123 --> 00:07:33,476
Our pro bono budget
can't cover high-risk surgeries

157
00:07:33,559 --> 00:07:35,274
For every employee
in this hospital.

158
00:07:35,357 --> 00:07:37,231
- We're not a charity.
- What happened to you?

159
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,402
- Excuse me?
- There was a time you would've convinced me to do this surgery,

160
00:07:41,485 --> 00:07:43,062
But now your first instinct
is no.

161
00:07:44,188 --> 00:07:45,179
Happened to you?

162
00:07:45,262 --> 00:07:47,788
You came to me as the chief
of surgery and I said no.

163
00:07:47,871 --> 00:07:51,219
As for my medical opinion,
it is still no.

164
00:07:51,302 --> 00:07:55,345
- There is such a thing as an inoperable tumor.
- What if it's not? What if I get in there, I open it up,

165
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,677
- I look around
- There is no way. Anything other than cutting the cord

166
00:07:57,758 --> 00:07:58,965
Would kill this man.

167
00:07:59,051 --> 00:08:00,668
I don't know how many times
you want me to say it.

168
00:08:00,751 --> 00:08:03,104
You are not operating
on an inoperable tumor.

169
00:08:06,706 --> 00:08:10,121
It's a tough job, derek.
You sure you still want it?

170
00:08:15,738 --> 00:08:17,123
So what did you do?

171
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:21,440
I scheduled the surgery.

172
00:08:22,332 --> 00:08:23,774
I'm taking out the tumor.

173
00:08:31,155 --> 00:08:33,311
Microsurgery
is about precision.

174
00:08:33,407 --> 00:08:36,226
The microscope changes
your perspective radically.

175
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:38,851
The hand-eye coordination
required can be learned,

176
00:08:38,928 --> 00:08:40,225
But now,
I need naturals.

177
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:42,006
Each one of you
will get a chance

178
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:46,183
To guide this pen
through the hole in the cup.

179
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:49,009
The person who makes a mark
closest to the president's nose

180
00:08:49,117 --> 00:08:51,858
And doesn't hit the side
of the cup gets to scrub in.

181
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:55,764
Who wants to go first?

182
00:08:59,285 --> 00:09:00,487
Take your time.

183
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,675
Do over?

184
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:20,292
No do overs.
Way to go, two.

185
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,977
Really concentrate.
Take your time.

186
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:33,004
Next. Take your time.
We've got nothing but time.

187
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,534
Next. Somebody, please.

188
00:09:40,656 --> 00:09:42,137
Well off the mark.

189
00:09:42,213 --> 00:09:46,040
- Get out.
- How did you get into this program?

190
00:09:46,138 --> 00:09:47,847
M. Confident.

191
00:09:53,523 --> 00:09:55,386
Next. Next.
Next. Next. Next.

192
00:09:55,486 --> 00:09:57,759
Disappointed.
I'm so disappointed.

193
00:09:57,862 --> 00:09:59,919
Here we go.

194
00:10:09,433 --> 00:10:10,692
Nicely done.

195
00:10:10,816 --> 00:10:13,256
If somebody improves on that,
I'll be out of a job.

196
00:10:14,271 --> 00:10:16,862
I guess you might need to retire, then.

197
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,782
You'll be scrubbing in.

198
00:10:45,063 --> 00:10:46,665
word on the o. R. Floor

199
00:10:46,748 --> 00:10:48,342
Is that you've gone rogue.

200
00:10:48,469 --> 00:10:50,674
I'm doing a surgery
I fully believe in.

201
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:53,755
- To piss off the chief.
- Since when did richard become your b.F.F.?

202
00:10:53,838 --> 00:10:57,063
- He's not my b.F.F. He's the chief.
- For now.

203
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:01,161
Have you gone rogue?
I'm doing a surgery
I believe in.

204
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:04,712
- Against the chief's orders. He'll freak when he finds out.
- There is a computer schedule

205
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,763
Saying that I'm doing
craniotomies all day.

206
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,981
- He is not gonna find out.
- Don't say anymore.

207
00:11:10,059 --> 00:11:12,287
'cause me, the chief,
secrets? Bad idea.

208
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:15,590
I think it is badass.
Come on.

209
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:16,877
Let's go.

210
00:11:18,443 --> 00:11:20,053
Should I be offended?

211
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,014
Because I'm trying
to come up with a good reason

212
00:11:22,097 --> 00:11:24,942
Why you paged every resident
to the skills lab but me.

213
00:11:25,036 --> 00:11:29,082
- Me. Your sister. Your sister.
- I think you're on my service.

214
00:11:29,162 --> 00:11:31,267
Little grey, I didn't page you
because I have

215
00:11:31,336 --> 00:11:33,959
Another job for you.
You gave me the idea, actually.

216
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,026
I need somebody in the o. R.
Who's gonna remind me

217
00:11:36,106 --> 00:11:38,428
To take breaks,
to bend my legs, to drink water.

218
00:11:38,522 --> 00:11:41,155
I will be your patient,
essentially.

219
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:44,477
- You want me to be your doctor?
- If dr. Sloan's okay with you

220
00:11:44,563 --> 00:11:46,213
Giving up his services,
of course.

221
00:11:46,352 --> 00:11:49,836
You love me, and this is
a once-in-a-lifetime tumor.

222
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:51,849
Go get your rogue on.

223
00:11:58,016 --> 00:12:00,162
You're nervous, right, about
being in there that long?

224
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:03,481
- Me, too.
- What do you have to be nervous about?

225
00:12:03,564 --> 00:12:05,423
Shepherd didn't even
let you compete.

226
00:12:05,506 --> 00:12:08,296
No. That's...
that's because he needs me

227
00:12:08,404 --> 00:12:10,711
To maintain his care
while we're in there.

228
00:12:10,834 --> 00:12:14,884
I'm his doctor, basically.
Wow. So you fell for that?

229
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:16,266
'cause, I mean, it sounds...

230
00:12:16,349 --> 00:12:18,139
It sounds more like
you're his bitch.

231
00:12:18,285 --> 00:12:22,380
What? No. I'm not

232
00:12:22,468 --> 00:12:24,567
You're gonna need to take
a break eventually

233
00:12:24,674 --> 00:12:27,010
And...and...and you're gonna
need to stretch.

234
00:12:27,093 --> 00:12:28,421
You're gonna need to pee.

235
00:12:28,568 --> 00:12:31,908
And when you do...
I'll be there to take over.

236
00:12:32,721 --> 00:12:34,401
Yeah, I don't...
I don't take breaks.

237
00:12:34,557 --> 00:12:36,184
You seriously think

238
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,924
- You're gonna last all day in there?
- I've done it before.

239
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,836
But that's because I know
how to stop taking fluids

240
00:12:41,963 --> 00:12:43,297
Before a long surgery.

241
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,006
Have fun playing nurse.

242
00:12:45,126 --> 00:12:47,254
I mean, it sounds... Neat.

243
00:12:58,556 --> 00:13:00,264
I don't know,
I think izzie had it right.

244
00:13:00,384 --> 00:13:02,737
Get fired, run away, die...

245
00:13:04,205 --> 00:13:05,478
I gotta call you back.

246
00:13:06,115 --> 00:13:07,471
Is that
what I think it is?

247
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:09,041
What? No. No!

248
00:13:10,411 --> 00:13:11,517
No!
Gimmie!

249
00:13:14,563 --> 00:13:15,917
A diaper?

250
00:13:16,098 --> 00:13:19,619
It's for the surgery. Please
don't tell anybody about this.

251
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,470
That's genius. You never
have to leave the o. R.

252
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:28,651
- You can hydrate all you want.
- You're mocking me.

253
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:31,952
Fine. Whatever. It's not like
I was gonna use it anyway.

254
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,841
Of course you are. This is
the definition of hard-core.

255
00:13:36,933 --> 00:13:39,296
You're like an astronaut.
This is surgery nasa-style.

256
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:41,411
You know what?
You put it on right now.

257
00:13:41,527 --> 00:13:42,907
I'll guard the door.

258
00:13:55,221 --> 00:13:57,408
Anybody opens their mouth
and they're fired.

259
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,096
You, too.

260
00:14:00,482 --> 00:14:02,917
Dr. Shepherd,
I was just describing

261
00:14:03,013 --> 00:14:04,849
Our new schedule
to some of our board members.

262
00:14:04,932 --> 00:14:06,595
This must be...

263
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:09,866
Mrs. Taylor.

264
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:11,907
And she's undergoing
a craniotomy.

265
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,785
It's mr. Taylor

266
00:14:16,236 --> 00:14:18,696
We're, still working out
a few kinks, clearly.

267
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:21,067
We should go.
Keep the trains running on time.

268
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,972
Nice meeting you all.

269
00:14:27,404 --> 00:14:28,971
Isaac, if I get in there

270
00:14:29,075 --> 00:14:30,722
And it looks too dangerous
to remove,

271
00:14:31,553 --> 00:14:33,726
The responsible thing
is to close you back up.

272
00:14:33,853 --> 00:14:35,393
Don't close me up.

273
00:14:36,204 --> 00:14:37,952
If you get in
and if it's too complicated,

274
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:39,993
Cut the cord.

275
00:14:40,665 --> 00:14:42,297
Paralyze me if you must.

276
00:14:43,775 --> 00:14:45,652
I survived a war.
Did you know that?
No.

277
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:48,737
I survived a war where they
put bodies into mass graves

278
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,688
Where there's once
a playground.

279
00:14:51,342 --> 00:14:53,190
I survived
the death of my family

280
00:14:53,319 --> 00:14:55,175
My parents,
my brothers and sisters.

281
00:14:56,013 --> 00:14:57,976
Then I survived the death
of my we and child

282
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,844
When they starved to death
in the refugee camp.

283
00:15:01,722 --> 00:15:03,276
I survived the loss
of my country,

284
00:15:03,746 --> 00:15:05,242
Of hearing
my mother tongue spoken,

285
00:15:05,325 --> 00:15:08,274
Of knowing what it feels like
to have a place to call home.

286
00:15:08,979 --> 00:15:10,214
I survived.

287
00:15:10,703 --> 00:15:13,175
And I will survive
the loss of my legs.

288
00:15:13,856 --> 00:15:16,748
If I have to,
I'll survive it.

289
00:15:19,796 --> 00:15:21,096
But.

290
00:15:21,635 --> 00:15:22,390
Yes?

291
00:15:23,515 --> 00:15:25,230
There is always a way.

292
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,788
When things look like
there's no way,

293
00:15:28,451 --> 00:15:29,941
There is a way.

294
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,081
To do the impossible,
to survive the unsurvivable

295
00:15:34,164 --> 00:15:35,605
There's always a way.

296
00:15:35,707 --> 00:15:38,580
And you? You and I
have this in common.

297
00:15:39,445 --> 00:15:40,708
We're inspired.

298
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:44,770
In the face of the impossible,
we're inspired.

299
00:15:45,429 --> 00:15:47,464
So if I can offer
one piece of advice

300
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:49,289
To the world's
foremost neurosurgeon...

301
00:15:49,852 --> 00:15:52,999
Today if you
become frightened...

302
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:56,614
Instead become inspired.

303
00:16:01,935 --> 00:16:03,348
I'm ready now.

304
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:05,896
Put me to sleep.

305
00:16:13,265 --> 00:16:14,685
The dura's opened.

306
00:16:15,362 --> 00:16:17,534
Let's get our first look
at the tumor.

307
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:20,950
That's

308
00:16:23,533 --> 00:16:26,375
The vessels are more intricate
than the m.R.I. Showed.

309
00:16:27,305 --> 00:16:29,174
There's no way I can get
the tumor out

310
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:31,115
Without rupturing one
and killing the cord.

311
00:16:31,215 --> 00:16:33,164
What do we do?

312
00:16:33,272 --> 00:16:35,660
If I start t-2, I could avoid
hitting the feeding vessels,

313
00:16:35,886 --> 00:16:37,543
So maybe I should go lower?

314
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:42,330
There's less vascularity
around t-7,

315
00:16:42,414 --> 00:16:44,975
- So that does seem better, no?
- It does seem better.

316
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:49,222
And you'd only get
function loss below the chest.
But I risk

317
00:16:49,293 --> 00:16:51,579
Rupturing the anterior
spinal artery there.

318
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,912
Probably. The tumor
tapers off there.

319
00:16:54,994 --> 00:16:56,747
Higher is better maybe?

320
00:16:56,863 --> 00:16:59,456
Either way, I risk sending him
into hemodynamic collapse.

321
00:17:00,609 --> 00:17:03,223
- He's not talking to us, is he?
- Not at all.

322
00:17:04,428 --> 00:17:06,535
T-2 shows less potential
for bleeding.

323
00:17:07,134 --> 00:17:09,409
At t-3, the vessels have...

324
00:17:11,154 --> 00:17:12,711
Increased.

325
00:17:22,795 --> 00:17:24,596
I'm sorry
about the contest.

326
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,674
- Who told you about that?
- No one. I just

327
00:17:27,726 --> 00:17:30,356
I overheard people
talking in the pit.

328
00:17:31,682 --> 00:17:32,653
It sounded hard.

329
00:17:32,736 --> 00:17:34,480
It wasn't hard.
It was a moment of...

330
00:17:34,547 --> 00:17:36,921
You know what? We--we don't
have to discuss it.

331
00:17:37,002 --> 00:17:39,746
Watching lexie in a diaper
is punishment enough.

332
00:17:40,447 --> 00:17:43,017
What? Lexie is wearing what?

333
00:17:43,111 --> 00:17:46,060
That is a reason

334
00:17:46,143 --> 00:17:47,982
You should be glad
that you're not down there.

335
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,805
- That is the reason I want to be down there.
- What?

336
00:17:51,896 --> 00:17:53,817
Lexie gets to pee in a diaper,
and I don't.

337
00:17:53,878 --> 00:17:56,891
- You wanted to pee in the diaper?
- Oh, god. No, no.

338
00:17:56,977 --> 00:17:59,555
I want to have to pee
in a diaper,

339
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:02,267
to be in a surgery
so difficult and so long

340
00:18:02,385 --> 00:18:03,442
That my only option

341
00:18:03,531 --> 00:18:05,470
Is to put on a diaper
and pee in it.

342
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:09,811
Are they just gonna

343
00:18:09,915 --> 00:18:11,451
let him stare at the thing all day?

344
00:18:11,534 --> 00:18:13,114
He hasn't made
a single cut.

345
00:18:14,944 --> 00:18:17,349
If I clip the draining veins
without getting the feeders,

346
00:18:17,465 --> 00:18:18,513
They'll burst.

347
00:18:19,855 --> 00:18:21,841
I really think it's time
for you to take a break.

348
00:18:21,924 --> 00:18:24,692
It's been er 8 hours.
I could go under the tumor here,

349
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:27,112
But I might cut
the radicular artery.

350
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:32,632
- If you need a break, just take a break.
- I don't need one. I'm hard-core.

351
00:18:32,734 --> 00:18:36,242
- Are you wearing a diaper?
- Shut up.

352
00:18:36,826 --> 00:18:39,492
- At least bend your legs.
- You can't bring yourself to use it, can you?

353
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,685
Shut up!
Shut the hell up.

354
00:18:41,812 --> 00:18:43,806
I don't need a break.
If you do, take one.

355
00:18:43,921 --> 00:18:46,180
Either of you open your mouths
again, you're out of the o. R.

356
00:18:51,121 --> 00:18:52,277
Bathroom break.

357
00:18:56,847 --> 00:18:57,635
What?!

358
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:00,792
Okay, I'm sure

359
00:19:00,884 --> 00:19:03,151
This is a completely
authorized surgery,

360
00:19:03,236 --> 00:19:05,304
But I thought you might like
to know that the chief

361
00:19:05,397 --> 00:19:07,113
Is scheduled to do a surgery

362
00:19:07,198 --> 00:19:09,256
Across the hall
in o. R. Three shortly.

363
00:19:09,372 --> 00:19:13,202
So if you're planning on
doing something, anything,

364
00:19:13,578 --> 00:19:15,071
You might want to do it soon.

365
00:19:17,021 --> 00:19:18,315
Thank you.

366
00:19:29,221 --> 00:19:31,224
I know she's not at home.

367
00:19:31,826 --> 00:19:33,290
You have to try her cell.

368
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:36,251
Fine. Just...no.

369
00:19:36,694 --> 00:19:39,372
Tomorrow at 10:00.
Don't cancel it.

370
00:19:39,494 --> 00:19:41,529
She'll be there.

371
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,111
What?

372
00:19:44,749 --> 00:19:46,551
You missed the contest
this morning.

373
00:19:46,683 --> 00:19:48,806
- The one you tanked?
- Whatever.

374
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,977
Shepherd has assigned us

375
00:19:51,063 --> 00:19:53,488
To round on his
canceled craniotomies.

376
00:19:53,571 --> 00:19:56,065
And as much as I'd rather
watch his ser-secret surgery

377
00:19:56,149 --> 00:19:57,306
From the gallery,

378
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:00,291
I can handle it myself
if you want to, you know,

379
00:20:00,391 --> 00:20:01,717
Deal with your izzie stuff.

380
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:04,065
I respected you more when you called her cancer wife.

381
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,590
- At least it was honest.
- I'm trying to be human here.

382
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,544
You think if I'm not there,
you might get to do

383
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:11,191
Some big, bad neuro, and tell
shepherd you did isolo,

384
00:20:11,315 --> 00:20:14,441
- Which, by the way, makes you the douche.
- You know what? I tried.

385
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:16,839
Go ahead.
Throw away your marriage.

386
00:20:16,928 --> 00:20:19,857
- I will be rounding.
- I'll be rounding.

387
00:20:22,336 --> 00:20:24,116
This is why
you don't go rogue.

388
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:27,078
Look at him. He's cracked.

389
00:20:27,687 --> 00:20:29,348
I could told you
this was gonna happen.

390
00:20:29,466 --> 00:20:33,995
- Don't be smug. This is one of our people's lives at stake.
- This is so depressing.

391
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,172
Ten hours
staring into his spine,

392
00:20:36,247 --> 00:20:39,028
- And he can't figure out what to do.
- What did you just say?

393
00:20:39,312 --> 00:20:41,844
What? No, I didn't
did I? I didn't

394
00:20:52,546 --> 00:20:55,681
Am I to understand that you
canceled your surgeries today

395
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,866
To operate
on a spinal cord tumor?

396
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:08,596
The rate of infection
for this patient

397
00:21:08,704 --> 00:21:10,907
Is increasing every second
you keep him open.

398
00:21:11,201 --> 00:21:13,376
Not to mention the thousands
of dollars you are wasting

399
00:21:13,484 --> 00:21:15,037
Standing here doing nothing.

400
00:21:15,161 --> 00:21:17,814
So I am demanding
that you close this man up.

401
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,722
Close him up
and relinquish the o. R.

402
00:21:22,136 --> 00:21:23,615
Right now.

403
00:21:37,823 --> 00:21:39,522
That's it. Let's close him up.

404
00:21:46,127 --> 00:21:47,365
There was no way
of taking it out

405
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,163
Without risking your life.

406
00:21:49,246 --> 00:21:51,017
And to cut the cord
at this point, I just

407
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:54,115
I won't do it.
You're still walking.

408
00:21:54,243 --> 00:21:56,155
Let's reassess this
in a few months.

409
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:58,070
I understand.
You worked hard today.

410
00:21:58,747 --> 00:21:59,843
You're tired.

411
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:05,406
I'm sorry.

412
00:22:05,489 --> 00:22:06,658
You'll try again tomorrow.

413
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:07,729
Tomorrow?

414
00:22:10,653 --> 00:22:12,006
No, I can't try again.

415
00:22:13,633 --> 00:22:15,677
The tumor is inoperable.

416
00:22:17,983 --> 00:22:19,085
I can't fix this.

417
00:22:19,415 --> 00:22:21,821
Go home. Sleep on it.

418
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:23,977
We'll talk more tomorrow.

419
00:22:29,025 --> 00:22:30,402
I don't understand.

420
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,821
There's nothing
to understand.

421
00:22:31,904 --> 00:22:34,776
I stood there for ten hours,
staring.

422
00:22:35,343 --> 00:22:36,399
In the o. R.?

423
00:22:36,482 --> 00:22:38,281
You stood for ten hours
and did nothing?

424
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:41,818
Let's talk about you now.

425
00:22:43,415 --> 00:22:45,172
How was your day?
My day?

426
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:47,441
My day was
you know, I slept,

427
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,501
And I ate
an entire box of cereal.

428
00:22:49,965 --> 00:22:51,588
I left three voice mails
for izzie.

429
00:22:51,633 --> 00:22:53,302
I'm sure she won't return
any of them.

430
00:22:53,385 --> 00:22:56,313
I started and gave up
on "anna karenina"

431
00:22:56,353 --> 00:22:57,625
For the fifteenth time.

432
00:23:01,306 --> 00:23:03,428
- You want to talk about the tumor?
- I do, please.

433
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:05,119
Just admit it.
I'm a surgery junkie.

434
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,621
It was more vascular
than the m.R.I. Showed.

435
00:23:08,265 --> 00:23:10,294
- You were able to do the decompression?
- Yes.

436
00:23:10,424 --> 00:23:13,057
- You weren't able to find a plane to dissect?
- No plane. Nothing.

437
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,550
It was just...

438
00:23:15,113 --> 00:23:17,980
- There was no path, nothing distinct.
- Why?

439
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,711
Because it was just...

440
00:23:21,431 --> 00:23:22,484
You know what?

441
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,929
I have an idea.

442
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:26,509
What are you doing?

443
00:23:28,524 --> 00:23:29,695
Just watch and learn.

444
00:23:34,378 --> 00:23:37,081
The tumor is here.

445
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,624
- You've completely lost your mind.
- From T-7

446
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,025
It goes all the way up
to t-2.

447
00:23:41,122 --> 00:23:44,297
- You're drawing on the wall.
- I open up the posterior column. It's chaos.

448
00:23:44,891 --> 00:23:48,029
I didn't know what vessel
was connected to the tumor

449
00:23:48,443 --> 00:23:50,091
Or to the cord.

450
00:23:50,224 --> 00:23:51,836
So what I did was...

451
00:23:56,435 --> 00:24:00,304
<i>Start here, the anterior
spinal artery could rupture.</i>

452
00:24:00,955 --> 00:24:02,524
The cord could die.

453
00:24:02,638 --> 00:24:04,360
Here, you risk catching

454
00:24:04,438 --> 00:24:06,567
The radicular artery
under the tumor.

455
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,333
The cord dies.

456
00:24:08,454 --> 00:24:10,497
But why not just cut
the draining veins at the top,

457
00:24:10,622 --> 00:24:13,767
- Expose the arteries?
- The draining veins are very thin.

458
00:24:13,831 --> 00:24:15,161
You slip up, they burst.

459
00:24:15,244 --> 00:24:17,489
He leaves my o. R.
A quadriplegic.

460
00:24:17,602 --> 00:24:19,855
- I might as well cut the cord.
- Which you didn't do.

461
00:24:19,944 --> 00:24:22,176
Even though isaac said
you could,

462
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:25,684
- Even though you knew it would save his life.
- He still has function in his legs.

463
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:28,830
No, but what I mean is,
you didn't cut the cord.

464
00:24:28,929 --> 00:24:30,563
You stood in the. R.
For ten hours.

465
00:24:30,688 --> 00:24:32,391
You knew the chief
would stop you.

466
00:24:32,495 --> 00:24:35,612
Anybody else would've,
and you didn't.

467
00:24:35,695 --> 00:24:37,803
So there must be
a reason why.

468
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:07,986
This patient understands

469
00:25:08,099 --> 00:25:09,836
what cutting the cord means?

470
00:25:09,946 --> 00:25:12,041
The loss of function
in both legs

471
00:25:12,124 --> 00:25:13,424
And possibly more?

472
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:15,386
We have to cut the cord
to kill the tumor.

473
00:25:15,469 --> 00:25:16,772
There's no other way.

474
00:25:21,099 --> 00:25:23,439
That'll only take
an hour or two.

475
00:25:24,436 --> 00:25:26,076
You can have o. R. One.

476
00:25:26,201 --> 00:25:28,829
- Hunt needs it after so he'll have enough time.
- Thank you.

477
00:25:28,948 --> 00:25:30,249
Good luck.

478
00:25:37,532 --> 00:25:38,919
We're not cutting the cord.

479
00:25:39,031 --> 00:25:41,564
- We're not?
- The mistake I made yesterday

480
00:25:41,659 --> 00:25:43,556
was that I wanted a plan.

481
00:25:43,652 --> 00:25:45,256
There can be no plan.

482
00:25:45,368 --> 00:25:47,694
I just have to pick a point
and cut.

483
00:25:47,801 --> 00:25:50,316
But what you said yesterday,
if you cut an artery

484
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:54,180
- Or hit the cord...
- Isaac wants us to take the risk.

485
00:25:54,802 --> 00:25:57,727
He wants a cure,
and it's our job to try.

486
00:26:00,255 --> 00:26:01,524
See you in the o. R.

487
00:26:03,748 --> 00:26:04,652
This is bad.

488
00:26:04,766 --> 00:26:06,371
This is really, really bad.

489
00:26:06,475 --> 00:26:07,809
Are you kidding?

490
00:26:07,906 --> 00:26:10,368
No one at mercy west
was this badass.

491
00:26:10,451 --> 00:26:12,716
This isn't badass.
This is...

492
00:26:13,424 --> 00:26:15,011
You saw him yesterday.

493
00:26:15,105 --> 00:26:16,908
He was spinning himself in...
in circles,

494
00:26:17,096 --> 00:26:19,055
Mumbling like
some crazy psych patient.

495
00:26:19,143 --> 00:26:21,398
And he was mean.
Well, he's
your psych patient now.

496
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,118
Deal with it,
diaper genie.

497
00:26:23,232 --> 00:26:25,691
I wore a diaper
yesterday, yes.

498
00:26:25,774 --> 00:26:27,210
And I will wear one today.

499
00:26:27,526 --> 00:26:30,052
If it helps get dr. Shepherd
through this surgery,

500
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:33,192
I will wear a diaper,
'cause my diaper is awesome.

501
00:26:33,327 --> 00:26:35,124
My diaper is hard-core.

502
00:26:35,207 --> 00:26:37,929
You wish you had the balls
to wear my diaper.

503
00:26:38,282 --> 00:26:40,768
I'm gonna wear it, and I'm
gonna wear it with pride.

504
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:43,719
And if I have to pee in it,
I'll pee,

505
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:45,433
Because I am a surgeon.

506
00:26:45,561 --> 00:26:49,625
This is america, and I will do
what needs to be done.

507
00:26:49,763 --> 00:26:54,028
So you can kiss my hard-core,
diaper-wearin' ass.

508
00:26:56,983 --> 00:26:58,795
You woke me from a nap.
This better be good.

509
00:26:58,914 --> 00:27:01,045
Napping during the day?
Actually, that is good.

510
00:27:01,126 --> 00:27:02,410
You're gonna need the rest.

511
00:27:05,074 --> 00:27:07,734
A redo retroperitoneal sarcoma?

512
00:27:08,792 --> 00:27:10,253
That's like
a 12-hour surgery.

513
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:12,564
Yeah, 15 if things
get ugly.

514
00:27:15,327 --> 00:27:16,366
Go, gear up.

515
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:38,470
Shepherd needs the o. R.

516
00:27:42,808 --> 00:27:44,667
I put on a diaper.

517
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,003
I've gotten the plane.

518
00:27:53,821 --> 00:27:55,169
Ready to make
our first cut.

519
00:27:56,067 --> 00:27:58,034
I heard you needed
some support.

520
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:01,892
You need people to talk to...
experienced surgeons.

521
00:28:01,975 --> 00:28:03,765
And you can't say no
because I'm in charge,

522
00:28:03,879 --> 00:28:06,079
And this is what
I'm prescribing.

523
00:28:08,393 --> 00:28:09,591
Thank you.

524
00:28:11,717 --> 00:28:12,840
Let's start.

525
00:28:17,725 --> 00:28:19,715
Making the first cut.

526
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:33,164
Did you
you paralyze him?

527
00:28:33,241 --> 00:28:35,919
No. One vessel down.

528
00:28:36,478 --> 00:28:38,743
Settle in.
We have many more to go.

529
00:28:40,287 --> 00:28:41,811
I still hear some wheezing,

530
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,796
Let's start you
on another breathing treatment.

531
00:28:52,412 --> 00:28:54,678
Can I see you for a minute?

532
00:28:54,772 --> 00:28:55,999
I'm a little busy.

533
00:28:58,605 --> 00:28:59,726
It's important.

534
00:29:02,398 --> 00:29:04,259
You need to go.
It's past 10:00.

535
00:29:04,351 --> 00:29:06,346
You're checking your watch
every five seconds.

536
00:29:06,421 --> 00:29:09,700
You're distracted. Just go.
I'll finish up here.

537
00:29:09,829 --> 00:29:11,389
Shut the hell up.

538
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:13,507
Come here.

539
00:29:14,997 --> 00:29:16,375
You don't even know me,
so why are you

540
00:29:16,458 --> 00:29:17,872
All up in my face
about this?

541
00:29:17,962 --> 00:29:20,025
Because there is a girl
sitting down there

542
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:21,884
On the third floor
waiting for her guy.

543
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,995
She doesn't want to see me,
okay? She bailed.

544
00:29:25,092 --> 00:29:27,404
She didn't even tell me
to my face. She left a note.

545
00:29:27,483 --> 00:29:28,490
Stop acting like,

546
00:29:28,527 --> 00:29:30,851
And let me get back to my job.

547
00:29:32,722 --> 00:29:36,387
If you are sure about
that, then fine. Don't go.

548
00:29:36,467 --> 00:29:38,189
But you better be 100% sure

549
00:29:38,254 --> 00:29:39,755
She's not hoping
that you show up,

550
00:29:39,822 --> 00:29:42,167
Because right now,
you are making a choice.

551
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,183
You, not her.

552
00:29:46,345 --> 00:29:48,327
So you better be
at peace with that.

553
00:29:53,864 --> 00:29:55,785
I've cleared a path
at t-5.

554
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:59,422
And if I continue along this plane,

555
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,957
M.E.P. Tracing's losing
amplitude. What just happened?

556
00:30:02,062 --> 00:30:04,012
<i>A vessel burst. It might have
been connected to the cord.</i>

557
00:30:04,082 --> 00:30:06,488
- If there's not enough blood reaching the cord
- I could've just paralyzed our patient.

558
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:08,224
Suction, please. Suction.

559
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:13,497
What, cristina?

560
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:14,841
What is it?

561
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:18,011
Easy. Careful.

562
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,623
More suction.
There's too much blood.

563
00:30:20,702 --> 00:30:23,575
- We're losing him.
- I should've just cut the cord. This is too risky.

564
00:30:23,703 --> 00:30:28,035
- Wait. It's back. Amplitude's up.
- So the cord didn't stroke out?

565
00:30:28,123 --> 00:30:31,245
- You didn't paralyze him?
- The vessel was connected to, the tumor. We're okay.

566
00:30:32,113 --> 00:30:33,200
Nice work.

567
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:34,865
Thanks.

568
00:30:36,448 --> 00:30:38,007
Take off my mask.

569
00:30:38,114 --> 00:30:41,333
- What?
- Take off my mask.

570
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,575
Take off my mask!

571
00:30:56,373 --> 00:30:59,095
Get in there. Take a breath
and get back in there.

572
00:30:59,178 --> 00:31:01,756
- You can do this.
- You really should drink something.

573
00:31:02,343 --> 00:31:05,270
- I'm fine.
- You're not. You're dehydrated and stressed.

574
00:31:05,345 --> 00:31:07,395
- You should drink something.
- I said I'm fine.

575
00:31:07,478 --> 00:31:08,458
Drink the water.

576
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,444
I said drink it!

577
00:31:38,211 --> 00:31:39,962
Shouldn't you be in o.R. One?

578
00:31:40,043 --> 00:31:42,884
Yes, but I
swapped with torres.

579
00:31:42,972 --> 00:31:44,777
She has
an emergency laparotomy.

580
00:31:45,547 --> 00:31:47,379
Dr. Torres is doing
a laparotomy?

581
00:31:47,464 --> 00:31:48,855
What am I doing?

582
00:31:49,778 --> 00:31:51,149
What? I just heard my name.

583
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:57,346
- He didn't cut the cord.
- Bailey will stop him. She's at the door.

584
00:31:57,430 --> 00:32:00,363
- Bailey's in the o.R. with Shepherd.
- Then who's at the door? Oh god.

585
00:32:00,936 --> 00:32:02,820
- Whoa.
- Move.

586
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:04,421
Dr. Robbins

587
00:32:04,513 --> 00:32:07,591
I said no.
Dr. Shepherd is operating

588
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,825
On the inside of man's
spinal cord right now.

589
00:32:09,857 --> 00:32:12,269
Even the most minor disturbance
could cause him

590
00:32:12,343 --> 00:32:13,728
To make a mistake
on that patient,

591
00:32:13,801 --> 00:32:16,326
A patient who happens
to work here and whose life

592
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:18,254
I personally would like to see
dr. Shepherd save.

593
00:32:18,337 --> 00:32:20,575
So no, you don't get to
go in there and be a bully.

594
00:32:20,658 --> 00:32:22,718
Not today, chief.
Not on my watch.

595
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:36,829
Okay, I totally thought
that was gonna end different.

596
00:32:43,385 --> 00:32:44,531
Yeah, more like that.

597
00:32:47,731 --> 00:32:50,254
Care to fill us in?

598
00:32:50,337 --> 00:32:51,518
No, I would not.

599
00:32:51,632 --> 00:32:54,302
Because anything outside of
this o. R. Is not your concern.

600
00:32:54,385 --> 00:32:56,184
Your only concern
is this patient.

601
00:32:56,756 --> 00:32:58,127
Now keep going.

602
00:33:03,631 --> 00:33:04,421
Damn it.

603
00:33:04,717 --> 00:33:05,642
What is it?

604
00:33:05,986 --> 00:33:08,324
I can't tell which one of
these vessels feeds the cord

605
00:33:08,414 --> 00:33:09,877
And which one feeds the tumor.

606
00:33:12,278 --> 00:33:14,947
I have to do a blind cut.
Like a trip wire?

607
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,310
If I cut the wrong one,
the entire cord strokes out.

608
00:33:19,773 --> 00:33:23,922
- We'll come back to this later.
- Later? So you could finish the entire surgery

609
00:33:24,005 --> 00:33:25,417
Only to cut the wrong one?

610
00:33:25,501 --> 00:33:27,004
- This will all have been for nothing?
- Exactly.

611
00:33:27,591 --> 00:33:29,791
But thanks
for pointing that out.

612
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:35,285
How many inches left?

613
00:33:35,405 --> 00:33:36,797
Less than 2.

614
00:33:37,511 --> 00:33:39,433
So if I do my math,
we got,

615
00:33:40,725 --> 00:33:43,270
- four or five more hours ahead.
- Crap. Oh, crap.

616
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:46,798
-What is it?
- It's my hand. It's cramping. Damn it

617
00:33:46,881 --> 00:33:49,105
Don't move. Don't ve.

618
00:33:49,183 --> 00:33:50,707
B.P.'s dropping.

619
00:33:51,725 --> 00:33:53,598
We're touching the cord.
If we disturb it any more,

620
00:33:53,717 --> 00:33:56,783
- We run
- pulse is down to 52.

621
00:33:56,894 --> 00:34:00,416
- It's getting worse, guys.
- Easy, easy. Don't move.

622
00:34:00,514 --> 00:34:02,915
Just stay still. I'm goign to reach in.

623
00:34:04,955 --> 00:34:07,564
Hey, close your eyes
and breathe.

624
00:34:08,273 --> 00:34:09,573
It's just a spasm.

625
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,612
B.P.'s back up.
100 over 68.

626
00:34:11,695 --> 00:34:14,444
- Have you had anything to drink today?
- What?

627
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,675
Muscle cramps are a sign
of dehydration.

628
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,364
You went without fluids

629
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:20,933
D. Grey couldn't get
her hands on the retractor. Right?

630
00:34:29,036 --> 00:34:30,099
Sorry.

631
00:34:31,997 --> 00:34:33,780
- Sorry.
- Don't apologize, just step aside.

632
00:34:33,843 --> 00:34:35,014
Dr. Grey, take over.

633
00:34:38,942 --> 00:34:39,702
Easy.

634
00:34:41,595 --> 00:34:42,773
Got it.
Easy.

635
00:34:48,778 --> 00:34:50,056
"a" or "b"?

636
00:34:52,414 --> 00:34:54,312
"a" or "b"?

637
00:34:54,434 --> 00:34:55,866
You're done?
You got it all out?

638
00:34:55,949 --> 00:34:57,534
Except for the blind cut.

639
00:34:57,617 --> 00:34:59,692
I just have to pick one,
and we're good to go.

640
00:34:59,802 --> 00:35:01,962
"a" or "b"?

641
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,330
You're kidding.

642
00:35:03,413 --> 00:35:05,023
You're stalling.

643
00:35:07,437 --> 00:35:08,972
I don't like to gamble.

644
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,396
Dr. Sloan?

645
00:35:11,034 --> 00:35:13,799
What, so you can blame it on me
for the rest of your life?

646
00:35:13,882 --> 00:35:16,541
This is all you.
Right. My call.

647
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:17,923
Great.

648
00:35:29,874 --> 00:35:31,356
He's deciding
which one to cut.

649
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:33,464
Guessing which one. There's no
logical way to make that call.

650
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:35,591
- I can't look. I...
- Oh my god.

651
00:35:35,757 --> 00:35:37,230
This is so good.

652
00:35:41,781 --> 00:35:42,943
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

653
00:35:43,064 --> 00:35:45,530
Catch a tiger by its toe.
If he hollers

654
00:35:45,613 --> 00:35:47,558
Are you playing
eeny, meeny, miny, moe?

655
00:35:47,532 --> 00:35:48,319
Yeah.

656
00:35:48,388 --> 00:35:49,205
No.

657
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,080
Yeah. It's a bad idea?

658
00:35:53,649 --> 00:35:54,485
Let's see.

659
00:36:08,293 --> 00:36:10,667
<i>Ask most surgeons
why they became surgeons,</i>

660
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:12,752
<i>They usually tell you
the same thing...</i>

661
00:36:13,475 --> 00:36:15,669
<i>The high, the rush,</i>

662
00:36:15,818 --> 00:36:17,572
<i>The thrill of the cut.</i>

663
00:36:17,722 --> 00:36:20,056
<i>For me, it was the quiet.</i>

664
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,324
Come on, shepherd.
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

665
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:25,849
Please don't be wrong.

666
00:36:30,663 --> 00:36:32,356
He cut. He made the cut.

667
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:35,072
Was it the right one?

668
00:36:37,446 --> 00:36:38,794
Tell me.

669
00:36:45,461 --> 00:36:46,409
No, no.

670
00:36:47,206 --> 00:36:48,007
No.

671
00:36:50,182 --> 00:36:52,064
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no.

672
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:54,094
No.

673
00:36:54,177 --> 00:36:55,743
What is it?

674
00:36:56,437 --> 00:36:57,192
I can...

675
00:36:59,566 --> 00:37:01,118
I can move my toes.

676
00:37:04,961 --> 00:37:06,461
It didn't work, did it?

677
00:37:07,528 --> 00:37:08,728
You couldn't do it?

678
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:11,243
No, no.
We got the tumor.

679
00:37:12,442 --> 00:37:13,757
It's gone.

680
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:15,719
But I can move my toes.

681
00:37:15,844 --> 00:37:17,305
Yeah, because we saved
the cord.

682
00:37:18,592 --> 00:37:20,362
It was
a successful surgery.

683
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:22,986
You're gonna be fine.

684
00:37:29,223 --> 00:37:30,929
I knew you would try, but...

685
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:34,960
I'm going to be okay?

686
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:35,946
Yes.

687
00:37:37,531 --> 00:37:39,349
I'm actually
going to be okay?

688
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:40,694
Yes.

689
00:37:45,801 --> 00:37:47,585
You're a good man.

690
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,823
You're a very good man.

691
00:37:52,139 --> 00:37:53,002
<i>Peace...</i>

692
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,425
<i>Isn't a permanent state.</i>

693
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:59,388
<i>It exists in moments...</i>

694
00:38:00,052 --> 00:38:01,438
<i>Fleeting...</i>

695
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,230
<i>Gone before we even knew
it was there.</i>

696
00:38:08,759 --> 00:38:10,523
Shepherd finished
the surgery.

697
00:38:10,995 --> 00:38:12,569
And I took care
of all the pre-ops.

698
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:14,761
We're good to go.

699
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:20,790
She didn't show.

700
00:38:27,894 --> 00:38:30,077
She can't be this stupid.

701
00:38:34,204 --> 00:38:35,653
I mean,
it...it saved her life.

702
00:38:35,736 --> 00:38:37,974
The I.L.-2 saved her life...

703
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:41,292
And she didn't show up.

704
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:44,495
She...

705
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,328
She didn't show up.

706
00:38:50,416 --> 00:38:52,376
Who doesn't show up?

707
00:39:02,535 --> 00:39:05,031
<i>We can experience it
at any time.</i>

708
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:07,325
<i>In the stranger's
act of kindness...</i>

709
00:39:10,754 --> 00:39:12,991
<i>A task that requires
complete focus...</i>

710
00:39:26,248 --> 00:39:27,921
You're standing too close.

711
00:39:29,183 --> 00:39:30,325
No, I'm not.

712
00:39:30,583 --> 00:39:33,218
Yes, you are.
I'll show you.

713
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,256
You?

714
00:39:35,532 --> 00:39:37,571
Look at your hands.
They're hams.

715
00:39:37,714 --> 00:39:39,584
Mine are
tiny little geniuses.

716
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:42,454
It's not about the hands.
It's about the body.

717
00:39:43,774 --> 00:39:45,150
You know,
it's your stance...

718
00:39:46,803 --> 00:39:47,912
Tilt of your head.

719
00:39:52,826 --> 00:39:54,320
There. And your eye line.

720
00:39:57,042 --> 00:39:58,274
If you stand too close,

721
00:39:58,357 --> 00:39:59,907
You throw
everything else off.

722
00:40:15,629 --> 00:40:16,329
Good.

723
00:40:17,557 --> 00:40:18,542
Go again.

724
00:40:22,538 --> 00:40:24,873
<i>Or simply the comfort
of an old routine.</i>

725
00:40:39,214 --> 00:40:41,052
We can't keep doing this,
richard.

726
00:40:43,978 --> 00:40:45,422
I'm tired of fighting you.

727
00:40:46,349 --> 00:40:47,882
Let's try
and put this behind us

728
00:40:47,965 --> 00:40:48,945
And move on.

729
00:40:49,407 --> 00:40:51,725
I can... If you can.

730
00:40:57,907 --> 00:40:59,048
You're fired.

731
00:41:00,302 --> 00:41:01,596
Immediately.

732
00:41:02,646 --> 00:41:04,554
Get the hell
out of my hospital.

733
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:10,417
Go home.

734
00:41:13,051 --> 00:41:14,300
Sleep on it.

735
00:41:15,858 --> 00:41:17,383
We'll talk more tomorrow.

736
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:24,569
<i>Every day, we all experience
these moments of peace.</i>

737
00:41:24,657 --> 00:41:27,231
<i>The trick is to know
when they're happening</i>

738
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:29,692
<i>So that we can embrace them,</i>

739
00:41:30,403 --> 00:41:31,743
<i>Live in them...</i>

740
00:41:39,817 --> 00:41:42,605
I've heard
almost everything

741
00:41:42,717 --> 00:41:43,783
From cristina,

742
00:41:43,866 --> 00:41:45,625
But I want to hear
your version.

743
00:41:45,738 --> 00:41:49,123
So start from the beginning
and tell me everything.

744
00:41:58,605 --> 00:42:00,904
<i>And finally let them go.</i>
