<i>You never know the biggest day of
your life is going to be the biggest.</i>

2
00:00:07,779 --> 00:00:11,332
<i>The days you think
are going to be big ones...</i>

3
00:00:12,893 --> 00:00:15,529
<i>They're never as big
as you make them out to be</i>

4
00:00:15,938 --> 00:00:17,063
<i>in your head.</i>

5
00:00:19,184 --> 00:00:20,034
<i>It's...</i>

6
00:00:20,631 --> 00:00:22,161
<i>the regular days...</i>

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,690
<i>The ones that...</i>

8
00:00:25,571 --> 00:00:27,289
<i>Start out normal...</i>

9
00:00:28,733 --> 00:00:30,263
<i>Those are the days</i>

10
00:00:31,328 --> 00:00:33,250
<i>that end up being the biggest.</i>

11
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:35,128
<i>And today</i>

12
00:00:35,874 --> 00:00:37,317
<i>was the wedding.</i>

13
00:00:38,191 --> 00:00:39,614
<i>It was beautiful...</i>

14
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:42,390
<i>Perfect.</i>

15
00:00:45,496 --> 00:00:46,842
Just a normal day.

16
00:00:46,967 --> 00:00:48,110
A normal day.

17
00:00:48,887 --> 00:00:50,271
We're going to work.

18
00:00:50,585 --> 00:00:54,281
Just a normal day that ends in
a ceremony in a churchy church.

19
00:00:54,496 --> 00:00:56,071
This has nothing to do with us.

20
00:00:56,597 --> 00:00:58,381
We're just the bride and groom.

21
00:00:59,816 --> 00:01:02,643
- We're getting married tonight.
- We're getting married tonight.

22
00:01:15,247 --> 00:01:17,343
- You slept here?
- I'm awake.

23
00:01:17,947 --> 00:01:20,070
- What?
- You slept here? I slept here.

24
00:01:20,957 --> 00:01:21,760
How?

25
00:01:21,887 --> 00:01:23,092
Wait, who, what?

26
00:01:23,215 --> 00:01:24,791
I slept in the on-call room.

27
00:01:27,467 --> 00:01:30,432
I could've been
at home in my own bed.

28
00:01:30,867 --> 00:01:32,831
- Sorry.
- Now I have to work all day,

29
00:01:33,387 --> 00:01:35,270
and then I have to be
happy maid of honor

30
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:37,262
and get Meredith down the aisle.

31
00:01:37,658 --> 00:01:40,102
- I'm so tired...
- Because I slept here,

32
00:01:40,716 --> 00:01:43,270
because you wanted to get
your freak on with roller skate girl.

33
00:01:43,406 --> 00:01:45,583
I am sorry.
I was gonna, but...

34
00:01:45,715 --> 00:01:47,652
we went to dinner and...

35
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,812
things didn't...

36
00:01:50,305 --> 00:01:51,410
I wasn't in the mood.

37
00:01:51,598 --> 00:01:53,603
I had to be here early anyway
to run the E.R., so...

38
00:01:53,736 --> 00:01:56,302
You're picking up
extra shifts in the E.R.?

39
00:01:56,646 --> 00:01:58,731
So is, Owen not here today?

40
00:01:58,855 --> 00:02:01,112
He's here.
Crap. I'm late.

41
00:02:05,888 --> 00:02:06,831
Big day

42
00:02:07,548 --> 00:02:08,970
Biggest day of your life.

43
00:02:09,097 --> 00:02:10,033
Don't do that.

44
00:02:10,167 --> 00:02:12,253
Don't do the peppy maid of honor thing.
It's creepy.

45
00:02:12,477 --> 00:02:13,292
Really?

46
00:02:13,586 --> 00:02:14,661
Good. Wait,

47
00:02:15,037 --> 00:02:16,741
is this, like, the calm
before the storm?

48
00:02:16,865 --> 00:02:18,910
Do you need me to drug you
or shave off your eyebrows

49
00:02:19,036 --> 00:02:21,123
- to numb you into submission?
- No, I'm fine.

50
00:02:21,248 --> 00:02:23,902
It's not the biggest day of my life.
It's the biggest day of Izzie's life.

51
00:02:24,037 --> 00:02:26,700
I'm excited about the marriage,
not some wedding.

52
00:02:26,838 --> 00:02:28,851
Anyway, she's the one
who's gone all bridezilla.

53
00:02:29,477 --> 00:02:31,073
Bridezilla.

54
00:02:31,467 --> 00:02:33,730
You should see
the bridesmaids' dresses.

55
00:02:34,327 --> 00:02:37,683
And the flowers...
They're being delivered at 5:00.

56
00:02:37,815 --> 00:02:40,183
I had to pay extra
for them to decorate the church, but

57
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:41,753
Derek gave me his credit card,

58
00:02:41,988 --> 00:02:43,762
told me to do what I had to do,
so...

59
00:02:43,887 --> 00:02:45,082
it's gonna be perfect.

60
00:02:45,218 --> 00:02:47,360
- How's her blood pressure?
- Within normal limits.

61
00:02:47,497 --> 00:02:48,872
And her incision site?

62
00:02:49,337 --> 00:02:51,552
As expected two weeks after surgery.

63
00:02:51,677 --> 00:02:53,860
Well, she just got off
the I.L. -2 38 hours ago.

64
00:02:53,996 --> 00:02:55,812
- She could still have...
- Her mets are gone

65
00:02:55,946 --> 00:02:57,231
her blood pressure's fine,

66
00:02:57,475 --> 00:02:58,983
her incision doesn't hurt.

67
00:02:59,438 --> 00:03:00,951
She's doing well.

68
00:03:01,516 --> 00:03:02,851
It's wedding day,

69
00:03:02,976 --> 00:03:06,262
and I am going to the wedding.
I'm a bridesmaid. I'm going.

70
00:03:06,387 --> 00:03:08,690
- Right, Bailey?
- I said you could go.

71
00:03:09,226 --> 00:03:10,361
Wedding day!

72
00:03:10,876 --> 00:03:12,093
Up top, Alex.

73
00:03:13,346 --> 00:03:14,803
I'll check on you later.

74
00:03:15,567 --> 00:03:17,270
Come on.
Don't leave me hanging, Bailey.

75
00:03:17,408 --> 00:03:19,171
- Wedding day.
- Wedding day.

76
00:03:21,807 --> 00:03:23,462
You just did that
'cause I have cancer.

77
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:25,403
- You didn't mean it.
- True.

78
00:03:36,385 --> 00:03:38,422
My hair is starting to fall out.

79
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:40,972
You still look good.

80
00:03:44,406 --> 00:03:46,271
I know what this means,

81
00:03:47,766 --> 00:03:49,033
you being here.

82
00:03:50,435 --> 00:03:53,090
- I'm sorry.
- I'm still going to the wedding.

83
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:01,223
S05E22 <i>What A Difference A Day Makes</i>

84
00:04:01,357 --> 00:04:02,522
- How's Izzie?
- Good.

85
00:04:02,645 --> 00:04:03,750
Is her B.P. stable?

86
00:04:04,355 --> 00:04:06,632
If she's hypotensive,
she really shouldn't go to the wedding.

87
00:04:06,765 --> 00:04:08,841
- You let me worry about Izzie.
- All right.

88
00:04:09,147 --> 00:04:10,941
Do you have anything for us?
Anything good?

89
00:04:11,066 --> 00:04:12,121
Nope, it's slow.

90
00:04:12,246 --> 00:04:13,952
You don't say
it's a slow day in the pit.

91
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:14,882
You never

92
00:04:15,087 --> 00:04:17,272
say it's slow. You just jinxed us.

93
00:04:17,407 --> 00:04:19,670
- It's a day and it's slow.
- When that phone starts ringing

94
00:04:19,806 --> 00:04:21,861
with traumas, you're gonna
wish you hadn't said that.

95
00:04:21,997 --> 00:04:23,942
The phone's not gonna ring.
It's a slow day.

96
00:04:27,895 --> 00:04:29,772
Go for Seattle Grace emergency.

97
00:04:33,788 --> 00:04:36,932
- I'll get the trauma gowns.
- Crap, crap. Incoming!

98
00:04:47,266 --> 00:04:48,922
How's it going with your shrink?

99
00:04:49,478 --> 00:04:50,682
I'm doing better...

100
00:04:51,078 --> 00:04:52,412
Inch by inch.

101
00:04:54,007 --> 00:04:56,071
Progress is... slow.

102
00:05:03,598 --> 00:05:05,123
It was your ceiling fan,

103
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:06,780
above your bed...

104
00:05:07,426 --> 00:05:08,780
the blades spinning like

105
00:05:09,005 --> 00:05:10,232
the blades of a chopper.

106
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:12,512
My shrink said that was the trigger

107
00:05:13,238 --> 00:05:14,103
to me,

108
00:05:15,768 --> 00:05:17,482
Choking you.

109
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,861
You know, we should probably
get going.

110
00:05:33,286 --> 00:05:35,690
David simons, 22.
He was in the driver's seat.

111
00:05:35,827 --> 00:05:37,770
His car got crushed by a semi.
Truck blew a tire

112
00:05:37,898 --> 00:05:39,700
and jackknifed across
four lanes of traffic.

113
00:05:39,825 --> 00:05:41,901
Take him to bay one
until we get a trauma room ready.

114
00:05:42,026 --> 00:05:44,183
- What are the injuries?
- He sustained chest contusions.

115
00:05:44,318 --> 00:05:47,262
- Otherwise, vital signs were stable.
- We can't be late.

116
00:05:47,435 --> 00:05:49,113
Ready? One, two, three.

117
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,833
- Late for what?
- Graduation.

118
00:05:51,957 --> 00:05:54,060
Becca wells, 21-year-old
restrained backseat passenger.

119
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:56,813
Vitals stable en route. Some shortness
of breath, but good breath sounds.

120
00:05:56,947 --> 00:05:59,042
Take her to bay two for now.

121
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,313
- He's gonna be so worried.
- David, is that you?

122
00:06:01,726 --> 00:06:03,481
Becca, are you okay?

123
00:06:03,778 --> 00:06:05,370
I think so. I don't know.

124
00:06:05,795 --> 00:06:07,550
- One, two, three.
- How about you?

125
00:06:07,676 --> 00:06:08,663
I'm talking.

126
00:06:08,937 --> 00:06:10,451
It can't be too bad if I'm talking,

127
00:06:10,628 --> 00:06:11,671
- Right?
- Right.

128
00:06:12,607 --> 00:06:14,402
22-year-old front seat passenger.

129
00:06:14,646 --> 00:06:17,201
Tenderness above the pelvis
and unstable B.P. in the field.

130
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,571
- Bay five.
- Is my girlfriend here?

131
00:06:19,826 --> 00:06:21,581
- She was in the backseat.
- Jordan!

132
00:06:21,718 --> 00:06:24,890
Becca? Becca, have you seen Dana?
You were sitting next to her.

133
00:06:25,028 --> 00:06:26,920
Can you check on
our other friends...

134
00:06:27,165 --> 00:06:30,240
- Dana, Michelle and Pete?
- Eight of them piled in an S.U.V.

135
00:06:30,377 --> 00:06:31,551
Are they all this bad?

136
00:06:31,687 --> 00:06:33,833
These are the healthy ones
compared to the rest.

137
00:06:33,967 --> 00:06:37,642
I need, beds and blood and interns,
and Owen Hunt. Where is Hunt?

138
00:06:37,815 --> 00:06:39,841
V-tach. B.P.'s dropped out.
I need the crash cart

139
00:06:39,965 --> 00:06:43,271
- I'm gonna cardiovert.
- David! What's wrong with him?

140
00:06:43,647 --> 00:06:45,031
Charge to 100. Clear.

141
00:06:45,206 --> 00:06:47,533
- Becca, what's wrong with david?
- You have to save him,

142
00:06:47,697 --> 00:06:49,471
Please. You can't let him die.
Not today.

143
00:06:49,596 --> 00:06:52,280
We're supposed to be graduating
from college today.

144
00:06:52,503 --> 00:06:53,498
Charge to 200.

145
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:55,207
Becca, what's going on?

146
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:58,164
- This is the biggest day of our lives.
- Where in the hell is Hunt?!

147
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:00,983
{\pub}Hunt, thank God.

148
00:07:01,178 --> 00:07:02,851
{\pos(192,220)}Trauma one through three.

149
00:07:04,835 --> 00:07:05,800
{\pos(192,230)}What do we got?

150
00:07:05,937 --> 00:07:09,412
{\pos(192,230)}Becca wells, respiratory rate of 20,
but otherwise, vital signs are stable.

151
00:07:09,635 --> 00:07:12,380
{\pos(192,230)}Is David okay?
He has to graduate today.

152
00:07:12,555 --> 00:07:14,961
He's the first person in his family
to go to college.

153
00:07:15,088 --> 00:07:17,643
Don't worry about your friends
right now. We'll take good care of 'em.

154
00:07:17,767 --> 00:07:20,283
No hemothorax or pneumothorax.
In line for C.T.

155
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:23,102
We're gonna do a few x-rays, get a
better idea of what's going on with you.

156
00:07:23,227 --> 00:07:25,922
You should try to rest. Your body's
in some serious shock right now

157
00:07:26,326 --> 00:07:29,140
{\pos(192,230)}I have a speech to give.
I'm supposed to...

158
00:07:29,998 --> 00:07:31,530
I'm valedictorian.

159
00:07:32,367 --> 00:07:35,401
{\pos(192,230)}All I've ever done is school.
It's all I've ever done.

160
00:07:37,787 --> 00:07:39,730
{\pos(192,230)}I haven't done anything else...

161
00:07:41,285 --> 00:07:42,442
{\pos(192,230)}Until today.

162
00:07:42,688 --> 00:07:45,490
{\pos(192,230)}Today's the day that my life
is supposed to start, which is why

163
00:07:46,537 --> 00:07:48,462
I'd really like to live, okay?

164
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:50,800
- Let me know the results of the C.T.
- Okay.

165
00:07:56,117 --> 00:07:57,942
{\pos(192,230)}I haven't seen Dana yet,
my girlfriend.

166
00:07:58,065 --> 00:07:59,741
She was in the backseat
next to Michelle

167
00:07:59,965 --> 00:08:01,602
Hang blood and push fluids.

168
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:04,023
{\pos(192,230)}she was singing to the radio.

169
00:08:04,588 --> 00:08:06,291
She never knows
the words to anything.

170
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:09,232
I turned around to tell her the words
and then... She wasn't there anymore.

171
00:08:09,368 --> 00:08:11,181
{\pos(192,230)}We need you to calm down
so we can treat you.

172
00:08:11,315 --> 00:08:13,753
{\pos(192,220)}- You have very serious injuries.
- She was not in the car anymore!

173
00:08:13,876 --> 00:08:15,783
I promise I will check
for you as soon as I can,

174
00:08:15,906 --> 00:08:17,432
but you need to stay still for me.

175
00:08:17,565 --> 00:08:19,413
She's wearing a pink sweater.

176
00:08:20,418 --> 00:08:22,251
Keep working.
Try to get his pressure up

177
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,822
{\pos(192,220)}before you move him anywhere.

178
00:08:27,635 --> 00:08:30,362
{\pos(192,220)}systolic and stabilizing, but
he's still having multiple arrhythmias.

179
00:08:30,496 --> 00:08:33,092
{\pos(192,220)}I'm thinking cardiac contusion.
I'm about to do a chest tube.

180
00:08:33,786 --> 00:08:35,750
You've got this, O'Malley.

181
00:08:36,346 --> 00:08:38,390
- I've got blood.
- Put it in the rapid infuser.

182
00:08:38,698 --> 00:08:39,930
Are my friends here?

183
00:08:40,055 --> 00:08:41,271
Did you see Pete?

184
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:44,023
- Which one's Pete?
- He's wearing red sneakers.

185
00:08:44,465 --> 00:08:45,391
And Michelle

186
00:08:45,518 --> 00:08:47,813
She dyed her hair blue
for graduation.

187
00:08:48,898 --> 00:08:51,041
{\pos(192,230)}Did you see her? Is she okay?

188
00:08:51,677 --> 00:08:52,803
I'll find 'em.

189
00:08:53,725 --> 00:08:56,123
- My whole family's coming.
- I know. It's a big day.

190
00:08:57,046 --> 00:08:58,181
For them.

191
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,231
{\pos(192,230)}Today is for them.

192
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:03,813
V-fib. He's coding.

193
00:09:03,946 --> 00:09:05,220
Get the paddles.

194
00:09:11,338 --> 00:09:12,452
You paged me?

195
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:16,963
{\pos(192,210)}Did you get the check for the caterers
and the cash tips for the waiters?

196
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,903
{\pos(192,220)}- Yes.
- Did you write your vows?

197
00:09:19,036 --> 00:09:20,153
Not yet. I will.

198
00:09:20,898 --> 00:09:22,980
{\pos(192,220)}You have to write your vows.
What you say to Meredith 

199
00:09:23,107 --> 00:09:25,723
{\pos(192,220)}on this day, it's important. She'll
remember it for the rest of her life.

200
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:27,901
{\pos(192,220)}I have patients, so if you paged me
to talk about the wedding,

201
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,772
{\pos(192,220)}That's not why I paged you.

202
00:09:32,608 --> 00:09:34,343
{\pos(192,220)}I have a craniotomy to get to.

203
00:09:35,488 --> 00:09:36,402
{\pos(192,230)}He's back.

204
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,240
{\pos(192,230)}Denny... he's back.

205
00:09:42,956 --> 00:09:47,441
{\pos(192,220)}- I'll page dr. Bailey, and we'll...
- order an M.R.I. I know the drill.

206
00:09:54,956 --> 00:09:57,000
{\pos(192,220)}You wanted to see me, Chief?

207
00:09:57,365 --> 00:10:00,303
{\pos(192,220)}Derek was supposed to do this,
but he got pulled into something, so

208
00:10:00,436 --> 00:10:02,100
- I said I'd give it to you.
- What?

209
00:10:03,258 --> 00:10:05,151
Your wedding present. Not from me.

210
00:10:05,285 --> 00:10:07,140
It's from Derek.
But I have to oversee it.

211
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:09,103
I was supposed to get him a present?

212
00:10:09,277 --> 00:10:11,460
- Meredith, it's...
- this is why weddings are so stupid.

213
00:10:11,595 --> 00:10:13,320
Our life together
should be the present,

214
00:10:13,448 --> 00:10:16,022
{\pos(192,220)}Not some stupid...
anyway, whatever it is, Chief,

215
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:18,101
I don't want it.
So tell Derek to take it back.

216
00:10:18,225 --> 00:10:19,232
I'll tell him.

217
00:10:19,538 --> 00:10:20,900
{\pos(192,220)}I'll tell him to take it back.

218
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,622
{\pos(192,220)}He got you a colon.

219
00:10:23,046 --> 00:10:24,761
{\pos(192,220)}- What?
- A colon.

220
00:10:25,617 --> 00:10:27,791
{\pos(192,220)}It's nonrefundable, it's inflamed,

221
00:10:28,167 --> 00:10:30,580
{\pos(192,220)}It's about to go under
anesthesia in O.R. two.

222
00:10:31,275 --> 00:10:33,320
{\pos(192,220)}You really want to say
you don't want it?

223
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:34,723
A solo surgery?

224
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,510
Happy wedding day, Meredith.

225
00:10:41,017 --> 00:10:41,992
{\pos(192,220)}Yes or no?

226
00:10:43,205 --> 00:10:45,502
I don't need a maybe.
I need a yes or a no.

227
00:10:46,698 --> 00:10:48,453
{\pos(192,220)}I'll be right here waiting.

228
00:10:49,977 --> 00:10:52,090
{\pos(192,220)}You think Shepherd
and Grey are gonna last?

229
00:10:52,405 --> 00:10:54,230
Like, 50 years last?

230
00:10:54,975 --> 00:10:57,221
{\pos(192,220)}A semi crashed into
a bunch of college kids

231
00:10:57,715 --> 00:11:00,122
on the day that I decided
to take an extra shift in the E.R.

232
00:11:01,068 --> 00:11:02,181
Great. Thank you.

233
00:11:03,016 --> 00:11:05,293
There's burns, digit amputations,
nasty,

234
00:11:05,515 --> 00:11:07,750
nasty facial lacerations,
so please don't go anywhere,

235
00:11:08,188 --> 00:11:09,562
- Relax.
- You promise?

236
00:11:09,685 --> 00:11:11,311
You're handling this.

237
00:11:12,278 --> 00:11:13,270
I am handling

238
00:11:13,966 --> 00:11:16,741
{\pos(192,220)}You can't put him here.
I've got doctors who need access.

239
00:11:20,667 --> 00:11:22,620
What went wrong last night?

240
00:11:23,505 --> 00:11:24,851
I'm kinda busy here, Arizona.

241
00:11:24,978 --> 00:11:28,470
I have four surgeries back-to-back and a
kid on life support, I'm kinda busy too.

242
00:11:28,596 --> 00:11:30,362
- What went wrong?
- That's not any better.

243
00:11:30,495 --> 00:11:32,043
Put him in the hall.

244
00:11:32,788 --> 00:11:33,691
We went out

245
00:11:33,908 --> 00:11:35,732
to a four-star restaurant,
best in Seattle.

246
00:11:35,907 --> 00:11:37,691
It was supposed to be fun, romantic,

247
00:11:37,828 --> 00:11:39,482
but then you ordered a salad

248
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:42,252
when they make the most delicious
french food, and then you picked at it,

249
00:11:42,378 --> 00:11:44,760
barely spoke to me, then bolted.
So what went wrong?

250
00:11:44,968 --> 00:11:47,162
- Did I do something?
- I just wasn't feeling it.

251
00:11:47,308 --> 00:11:51,512
I was exhausted, tired.
Sorry. Hey! I said the hall.

252
00:11:52,605 --> 00:11:53,672
The hall.

253
00:11:57,518 --> 00:11:58,752
Fill me in, O'Malley.

254
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:01,012
I put in the first chest tube,
but there was no blood.

255
00:12:01,136 --> 00:12:02,891
Tried another one,
but there's no pulse.

256
00:12:03,026 --> 00:12:04,760
- How long has he been down?
- 20 minutes.

257
00:12:04,888 --> 00:12:06,570
- Should I open his chest?
- He's gone

258
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,352
- Move on.
- He's supposed to graduate.

259
00:12:08,488 --> 00:12:10,273
- move on. Let it go
- To see him graduate.

260
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,381
He is gone. You can't save him.

261
00:12:12,506 --> 00:12:14,310
You move on to save
the people you can.

262
00:12:15,345 --> 00:12:16,732
We have more trauma coming in.

263
00:12:19,366 --> 00:12:20,190
Now. Move.

264
00:12:20,868 --> 00:12:22,020
Call it, Grey.

265
00:12:24,626 --> 00:12:26,560
Time of death... 9:24.

266
00:12:34,827 --> 00:12:38,191
{\pub}It could be anything.
It could be scar tissue, okay?

267
00:12:38,316 --> 00:12:40,101
- We just wait and see.
- It's a tumor.

268
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:41,612
You don't know that.

269
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,803
{\pos(192,210)}Denny Duquette
is standing right behind you.

270
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:47,721
{\pos(192,210)}It's a tumor.

271
00:12:48,036 --> 00:12:48,913
{\pos(192,210)}Right, Denny?

272
00:12:51,656 --> 00:12:53,690
{\pos(192,210)}It's good to see you, dr. Bailey.

273
00:12:55,486 --> 00:12:57,450
You can't see him because
you don't have a tumor,

274
00:12:57,575 --> 00:12:58,611
but he says hi.

275
00:12:59,157 --> 00:13:01,212
Tell Denny Duquette I said go home.

276
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:11,120
It's a tumor.

277
00:13:11,775 --> 00:13:13,010
Wait and see.

278
00:13:18,356 --> 00:13:20,712
I'm sorry.
I'm crying more than usual.

279
00:13:22,007 --> 00:13:24,171
You said I'm in shock. Is that it?

280
00:13:25,297 --> 00:13:26,911
It's also the morphine.

281
00:13:27,918 --> 00:13:29,773
I should've slept with David.

282
00:13:30,858 --> 00:13:32,840
I thought about it, but

283
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:35,033
he was... sweet and

284
00:13:35,657 --> 00:13:37,161
and funny and...

285
00:13:38,157 --> 00:13:40,251
I would've fallen in love with him.

286
00:13:42,035 --> 00:13:44,582
And I didn't want a relationship
till after school. I...

287
00:13:45,668 --> 00:13:47,663
I don't like to do things...

288
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,011
halfway. I was doing

289
00:13:50,388 --> 00:13:51,673
school, and then

290
00:13:52,205 --> 00:13:54,570
I was gonna do life.
And now...

291
00:13:56,827 --> 00:13:58,371
Now David's dead.

292
00:13:59,626 --> 00:14:00,852
David's dead.

293
00:14:01,525 --> 00:14:02,980
How was the C.T., Karev?

294
00:14:03,116 --> 00:14:05,762
Her stomach is herniating
into her left hemithorax

295
00:14:05,885 --> 00:14:07,382
from a huge lac in her diaphragm.

296
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:11,413
We're taking you to surgery soon.

297
00:14:16,718 --> 00:14:17,890
I should've...

298
00:14:18,585 --> 00:14:20,931
I should've had sex with David
when I had the chance.

299
00:14:24,718 --> 00:14:25,510
Dana...

300
00:14:26,928 --> 00:14:27,782
Is she okay?

301
00:14:28,888 --> 00:14:30,740
The paramedics
haven't brought her in yet,

302
00:14:30,868 --> 00:14:32,661
but as soon as they do,
I'll let you know.

303
00:14:32,795 --> 00:14:35,220
Do you have any,
family we can contact?

304
00:14:35,637 --> 00:14:36,762
They're in Argentina.

305
00:14:38,557 --> 00:14:40,263
I'm supposed to fly there tomorrow.

306
00:14:41,365 --> 00:14:42,593
It's d-day.

307
00:14:43,298 --> 00:14:44,232
It's what?

308
00:14:44,998 --> 00:14:46,511
That's what Dana calls it.

309
00:14:47,926 --> 00:14:51,733
My parents don't have the money
to let me stay. I have to go back.

310
00:14:53,328 --> 00:14:54,891
We both knew d-day was coming.

311
00:14:55,788 --> 00:14:57,920
I tried to break up with her
to make it easier.

312
00:14:58,275 --> 00:15:01,871
I'd switch classes every semester
so that we didn't have any together.

313
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:05,731
But it didn't matter.

314
00:15:06,256 --> 00:15:08,050
I couldn't stay away.

315
00:15:09,935 --> 00:15:12,972
When you love someone, you know,
love is love.

316
00:15:14,886 --> 00:15:17,602
It doesn't matter that you're not
supposed to be together.

317
00:15:19,505 --> 00:15:20,811
How's he doing?

318
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:24,871
He's starting to stabilize.

319
00:15:24,996 --> 00:15:26,593
Good. Looks like he's ready for C.T.

320
00:15:27,736 --> 00:15:28,741
I think...

321
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,330
Maybe she got out in time.

322
00:15:33,705 --> 00:15:35,802
Maybe she's not hurt that bad.

323
00:15:37,105 --> 00:15:39,133
Because when I turned around...

324
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,142
She wasn't there.

325
00:15:42,605 --> 00:15:44,670
She was not there anymore.

326
00:15:52,917 --> 00:15:54,782
X-ray is really backed up, but...

327
00:15:55,965 --> 00:15:57,220
- That's Pete.
- What?

328
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,863
David's friend... Pete. The...

329
00:15:58,988 --> 00:16:01,120
- The red sneakers.
- Could you get over here and help me?

330
00:16:01,248 --> 00:16:03,581
He's bleeding through
the dressing on the chest wound.

331
00:16:05,336 --> 00:16:06,580
Pulse is 220.

332
00:16:10,385 --> 00:16:12,251
Pericardial effusion.
Get me a syringe

333
00:16:12,386 --> 00:16:14,133
and a spinal needle.

334
00:16:15,146 --> 00:16:16,680
I'm going in through the wound.

335
00:16:19,888 --> 00:16:21,811
I'm gonna need another syringe, now.

336
00:16:21,937 --> 00:16:24,711
- There's too much blood.
- Just keep the syringes coming.

337
00:16:25,126 --> 00:16:27,163
Give me a 60cc this time.

338
00:16:27,845 --> 00:16:30,401
- Asystole. He's flatlining.
- Get the cardio board.

339
00:16:30,538 --> 00:16:31,862
- There.
- Just...

340
00:16:32,285 --> 00:16:33,432
Keep holding pressure.

341
00:16:33,565 --> 00:16:36,903
I'm starting compressions on my count.
One, two, three.

342
00:16:45,276 --> 00:16:48,880
Just keeping putting pressure.
I am not losing another one.

343
00:16:55,086 --> 00:16:56,193
Thank you.

344
00:16:57,885 --> 00:17:00,023
You're scrubbing in?
I thought I was doing this solo.

345
00:17:00,148 --> 00:17:00,953
You are

346
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:03,433
Then why aren't you sitting
in a corner reading a magazine?

347
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:06,550
This is a big day, Meredith. I'm just
taking precautions, that's all.

348
00:17:07,345 --> 00:17:09,623
Afraid I'm gonna kill
the patient on my wedding day?

349
00:17:09,888 --> 00:17:12,322
It's a routine colectomy.
I'm not gonna kill him.

350
00:17:12,536 --> 00:17:14,902
I know. You're gonna do great.

351
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,202
- Pretend I'm not even here.
- Okay.

352
00:17:18,448 --> 00:17:20,540
Okay, boki... scalpel.

353
00:17:22,905 --> 00:17:24,582
Great. Very nice.

354
00:17:26,757 --> 00:17:27,583
What?

355
00:17:28,367 --> 00:17:30,900
The way you asked for the scalpel.
You didn't mumble.

356
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:34,142
You took charge right off the bat.
Loud and clear "scalpel."

357
00:17:34,758 --> 00:17:36,932
It was good. Very impressive.

358
00:17:38,128 --> 00:17:38,951
Great.

359
00:17:42,806 --> 00:17:45,672
- I'm gonna get started now, so...
- Of course.

360
00:17:46,135 --> 00:17:47,822
You won't even know I'm here.

361
00:17:58,696 --> 00:17:59,491
Thanks.

362
00:17:59,626 --> 00:18:01,753
Maybe I'll toast to the fact
that they found each other.

363
00:18:01,876 --> 00:18:04,803
It doesn't bring up the future. It does
not talk about whether they'll make it.

364
00:18:05,005 --> 00:18:06,290
It's good, right?

365
00:18:07,297 --> 00:18:08,822
You said you were tired, exhausted,

366
00:18:08,956 --> 00:18:11,731
but you can't be that exhausted if you
are working in the E.R. on your day off

367
00:18:11,855 --> 00:18:12,883
I rallied.

368
00:18:13,345 --> 00:18:15,372
You rallied? You're lying.

369
00:18:15,496 --> 00:18:16,981
No, I'm not lying. I love the E.R.

370
00:18:17,116 --> 00:18:18,470
Can you hold, please? Thanks.

371
00:18:18,655 --> 00:18:19,971
You love the E.R.?

372
00:18:20,146 --> 00:18:21,771
Can't get enough of it.
It's fun.

373
00:18:27,516 --> 00:18:28,661
You should tell her.

374
00:18:28,978 --> 00:18:29,940
Suck it, Mark.

375
00:18:30,936 --> 00:18:33,171
We need more blood
in trauma two. Go.

376
00:18:34,987 --> 00:18:36,552
- What?
- I just lost another one.

377
00:18:36,685 --> 00:18:38,273
All my patients are dying.
I need you to pull me.

378
00:18:38,395 --> 00:18:41,242
That's for me to decide. There's an
ambulance coming in. Go see what you can do.

379
00:18:41,376 --> 00:18:43,310
- I'm in over my head.
- Walk away O'Malley.

380
00:18:45,845 --> 00:18:49,003
That's Michelle.
She dyed her hair for graduation.

381
00:18:53,885 --> 00:18:54,710
Look.

382
00:18:55,867 --> 00:18:57,603
I'm looking,
but I don't see anything.

383
00:18:57,725 --> 00:18:59,152
Because there's nothing there.

384
00:18:59,495 --> 00:19:01,110
- The scan's clean.
- I told you.

385
00:19:01,496 --> 00:19:03,022
Then why is Denny back?

386
00:19:03,897 --> 00:19:06,470
The man's a hallucination. That means
there has to be something there.

387
00:19:06,918 --> 00:19:10,462
Look, Izzie, if it's clear, then...

388
00:19:11,836 --> 00:19:13,611
I want to go to this wedding.

389
00:19:14,388 --> 00:19:17,081
I want to watch the bride walk
down the aisle. I want to

390
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:20,642
hear the vows.
I want to catch the bouquet.

391
00:19:21,187 --> 00:19:24,012
I planned this wedding down
to the very last detail. It's

392
00:19:24,277 --> 00:19:26,470
the perfect wedding.
This wedding...

393
00:19:26,828 --> 00:19:27,883
is perfect.

394
00:19:30,328 --> 00:19:32,353
You know how much
I want to be there.

395
00:19:33,087 --> 00:19:35,282
So why would I tell you about Denny,

396
00:19:35,655 --> 00:19:38,261
today of all days?
Why wouldn't I just wait?

397
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:40,700
Denny is back.

398
00:19:41,225 --> 00:19:43,042
That means something is there.

399
00:19:43,346 --> 00:19:44,781
It's not like we can just...

400
00:19:45,088 --> 00:19:47,882
Map the brain for hallucinations
the way we do a seizure.

401
00:19:48,018 --> 00:19:49,141
Wait a minute.

402
00:19:49,417 --> 00:19:51,001
What are hallucinations?

403
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:54,113
Hallucinations are
neurons firing in the brain.

404
00:19:54,248 --> 00:19:55,183
Exactly.

405
00:19:55,597 --> 00:19:56,410
Why?

406
00:19:56,637 --> 00:19:59,363
It's never been done before,
but if we can somehow

407
00:20:00,067 --> 00:20:01,920
induce your hallucination,

408
00:20:02,057 --> 00:20:04,732
there's a chance that we could
pick it up on an E.E.G.

409
00:20:04,977 --> 00:20:06,932
Then we could pinpoint
the part of the brain

410
00:20:07,118 --> 00:20:08,420
that's hallucinating.

411
00:20:09,997 --> 00:20:11,210
Trauma one's open.

412
00:20:11,715 --> 00:20:13,692
- What do we have?
- She had a pulse in the field,

413
00:20:13,825 --> 00:20:16,270
but we haven't been able
to get one now for over 30 minutes.

414
00:20:16,536 --> 00:20:19,583
I'm pretty sure we left half her blood
volume on the side of the road.

415
00:20:20,156 --> 00:20:22,300
She's D.O.A., man.
I just need you to call it.

416
00:20:23,007 --> 00:20:24,513
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

417
00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:27,411
Crap. A pink sweater.

418
00:20:27,547 --> 00:20:29,483
That's Jordan's girlfriend.
Move her out of here.

419
00:20:29,618 --> 00:20:31,562
- I need you to call it.
- Time of death...

420
00:20:36,446 --> 00:20:38,392
Time of death... 10:45.

421
00:20:38,945 --> 00:20:40,692
- He's coding.
- Get a crash cart.

422
00:20:44,946 --> 00:20:46,240
{\pub}We are closed to trauma.

423
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,452
Because we have trauma
coming out of our butts.

424
00:20:48,877 --> 00:20:50,250
{\pos(192,210)}You have a nice day, too.

425
00:20:52,786 --> 00:20:54,210
{\pos(192,210)}So the E.R. is fun, but I'm not?

426
00:20:54,908 --> 00:20:56,681
{\pos(192,210)}You can get enough of me?

427
00:20:56,818 --> 00:20:58,080
{\pos(192,210)}Is that what you're saying?

428
00:20:58,207 --> 00:20:59,943
Do you just want to just end this?
Because

429
00:21:00,065 --> 00:21:02,071
there are women that are
lining up for me. I'm hot,

430
00:21:02,196 --> 00:21:04,623
and if you want out, then you should
just have the guts to say so.

431
00:21:04,747 --> 00:21:05,660
I can take it.

432
00:21:05,788 --> 00:21:07,922
Maybe this was just a fling
that's run its course, okay?

433
00:21:08,046 --> 00:21:09,873
- Maybe it's over.
- Maybe it is.

434
00:21:16,936 --> 00:21:20,300
I got some adhesions. I need to
dissect down to mobilize the sigmoid.

435
00:21:21,277 --> 00:21:22,583
Bovie, please.

436
00:21:27,315 --> 00:21:29,073
Do you have something
you'd like to say?

437
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,321
You're doing fine.

438
00:21:33,848 --> 00:21:36,162
How's the solo surgery
coming along, Grey?

439
00:21:36,288 --> 00:21:39,903
I think it's going okay, but you should
probably ask the Chief here.

440
00:21:41,385 --> 00:21:44,960
She's doing great.
She chose a cautery when, at one point,

441
00:21:45,085 --> 00:21:47,540
I probably would've gone with scissors,
but she made it work.

442
00:21:47,677 --> 00:21:50,212
We'll be out of here
in plenty of time for the wedding.

443
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:51,421
Good.

444
00:21:51,796 --> 00:21:53,410
Then she won't have any excuses.

445
00:21:54,038 --> 00:21:54,851
Excuse me?

446
00:21:54,978 --> 00:21:57,192
This is the second time
I've been Derek's best man.

447
00:21:57,547 --> 00:21:58,993
I have to come up with a toast,

448
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:01,270
offer some words of wisdom...
it's a lot of work.

449
00:22:01,576 --> 00:22:03,981
I don't want to have to be
his best man a third time

450
00:22:04,106 --> 00:22:05,320
if you know what I mean.

451
00:22:05,496 --> 00:22:07,240
So you came in here to threaten me?

452
00:22:08,037 --> 00:22:09,233
I'm his best man.

453
00:22:09,438 --> 00:22:10,402
That's my job.

454
00:22:12,496 --> 00:22:13,531
What now?

455
00:22:14,376 --> 00:22:16,180
It's okay. It's fine.
Everything...

456
00:22:16,317 --> 00:22:18,860
everything's fine, right?
I don't need to say anything.

457
00:22:23,845 --> 00:22:25,340
So... now what?
I just

458
00:22:25,616 --> 00:22:27,921
try to have a hallucination?

459
00:22:31,468 --> 00:22:33,952
Is it always Denny?
I mean, no one else?

460
00:22:36,695 --> 00:22:38,253
- What?
- Oh, no, nothing.

461
00:22:39,155 --> 00:22:41,143
It makes sense.
It's the man you love.

462
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:42,523
He's not the man I love.

463
00:22:42,876 --> 00:22:43,781
He's not?

464
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:50,251
I love Denny. I will always love Denny.
He means a lot to me. I...

465
00:22:51,505 --> 00:22:56,141
But I think I hallucinate Denny because
I associate him with death and dying.

466
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:59,162
When I think about my future,
who I am now,

467
00:22:59,297 --> 00:23:01,480
who I want to be,
how I want to spend the rest of my life,

468
00:23:01,608 --> 00:23:04,193
when you get that
flutter in your chest

469
00:23:07,585 --> 00:23:08,843
Alex is the man I love.

470
00:23:09,918 --> 00:23:10,723
Karev.

471
00:23:12,565 --> 00:23:14,242
I love Alex Karev.

472
00:23:15,937 --> 00:23:18,713
So... let's find this tumor

473
00:23:18,845 --> 00:23:22,301
and get it out of me so that
we can have our perfect wedding...

474
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:25,352
a wedding not wasted on two people
who don't appreciate weddings.

475
00:23:26,376 --> 00:23:28,270
- I can hear you.
- I know you can hear me.

476
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:30,051
I mean for you to hear me.

477
00:23:32,825 --> 00:23:35,321
- What if I can't make him appear?
- We'll wait until he appears.

478
00:23:36,385 --> 00:23:38,131
You have to be at the church
in two hours.

479
00:23:38,256 --> 00:23:40,280
- It could take more than two hours.
- I'll be late.

480
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:43,442
No being late.
I'll make him appear. I can do this.

481
00:23:45,336 --> 00:23:46,802
Come on, denny.

482
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:00,810
How are my friends doing?

483
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:02,700
Just tell me.

484
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:04,901
I can take it.

485
00:24:06,657 --> 00:24:08,053
I mean, I can't,

486
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:09,283
but I can.

487
00:24:12,907 --> 00:24:14,112
Did someone else die?

488
00:24:14,248 --> 00:24:15,910
Why don't you tell me your speech?

489
00:24:16,386 --> 00:24:18,721
- Your graduation speech.
- I can take it.

490
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:19,950
Becca, just...

491
00:24:21,088 --> 00:24:22,362
Just give me your speech.

492
00:24:22,596 --> 00:24:24,161
You worked hard on it.

493
00:24:24,527 --> 00:24:26,021
You should do it right now.

494
00:24:26,486 --> 00:24:27,381
Come on.

495
00:24:30,245 --> 00:24:32,242
<i>Today is the day my life begins.</i>

496
00:24:35,045 --> 00:24:36,051
<i>Today...</i>

497
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:39,072
<i>I become a citizen of the world.</i>

498
00:24:40,355 --> 00:24:41,170
<i>Today</i>

499
00:24:42,058 --> 00:24:43,902
<i>I become a grown-up.</i>

500
00:24:44,615 --> 00:24:46,800
<i>Today I become accountable</i>

501
00:24:47,197 --> 00:24:50,212
<i>to someone other than myself
and my parents...</i>

502
00:24:50,878 --> 00:24:52,881
<i>accountable for more than my grades.</i>

503
00:24:53,596 --> 00:24:56,593
<i>Today I become accountable
to the world...</i>

504
00:24:57,977 --> 00:24:59,503
<i>to the future...</i>

505
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:03,053
<i>to all the possibilities
that life has to offer.</i>

506
00:25:04,175 --> 00:25:05,542
<i>Starting today...</i>

507
00:25:06,178 --> 00:25:08,082
Come on, denny.
Come on.

508
00:25:08,396 --> 00:25:10,422
<i>My job is to show up...</i>

509
00:25:12,496 --> 00:25:14,920
<i>wide-eyed...
and willing</i>

510
00:25:15,886 --> 00:25:16,982
<i>and ready.</i>

511
00:25:18,657 --> 00:25:19,642
<i>For what?</i>

512
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:22,232
<i>I don't know.</i>

513
00:25:23,237 --> 00:25:24,391
<i>For anything...</i>

514
00:25:25,348 --> 00:25:26,551
<i>for everything...</i>

515
00:25:32,668 --> 00:25:34,082
Damn it. Charge to 360.

516
00:25:34,686 --> 00:25:35,690
<i>To take on</i>

517
00:25:36,217 --> 00:25:37,162
<i>life...</i>

518
00:25:37,676 --> 00:25:38,741
Nice job, Meredith.

519
00:25:39,407 --> 00:25:40,442
<i>To take on love...</i>

520
00:25:40,715 --> 00:25:42,633
all the times I didn't ask for you,

521
00:25:42,755 --> 00:25:44,581
and you were here.
Now I'm asking.

522
00:25:44,707 --> 00:25:45,731
Please.

523
00:25:47,165 --> 00:25:50,391
Please come to me now.
Please help me now. Come on.

524
00:25:51,096 --> 00:25:53,690
Come on, denny. Just...
You come to me now.

525
00:25:59,167 --> 00:26:00,783
<i>To take on...</i>

526
00:26:01,425 --> 00:26:04,230
<i>the responsibility and possibility.</i>

527
00:26:09,678 --> 00:26:12,193
<i>Today, my friends, are lives begin.</i>

528
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:14,681
Time of death... 13:02.

529
00:26:15,055 --> 00:26:16,442
And I, for one...

530
00:26:20,348 --> 00:26:21,122
There.

531
00:26:21,466 --> 00:26:22,713
<i>Can't wait.</i>

532
00:26:23,086 --> 00:26:24,370
I'm here for you, Izzie.

533
00:26:25,868 --> 00:26:26,951
It's right there.

534
00:26:43,297 --> 00:26:46,293
{\pub}These the results
of the tesla 7 M.R.I.?

535
00:26:46,967 --> 00:26:49,521
You know that part of the brain
that reacted during the hallucination?

536
00:26:50,415 --> 00:26:52,821
It was the other temporal lobe.

537
00:26:52,957 --> 00:26:53,763
That...

538
00:26:54,338 --> 00:26:55,912
That's the tumor?

539
00:26:57,785 --> 00:26:58,593
Tiny.

540
00:26:59,635 --> 00:27:01,670
Too small to pick up
on a normal M.R.I.

541
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:05,393
But... okay, if it's that small,
how are you gonna get to it?

542
00:27:17,758 --> 00:27:19,663
I wish there was something
I could do for her.

543
00:27:20,318 --> 00:27:21,573
I wish I could...

544
00:27:23,268 --> 00:27:24,612
I like Stevens.

545
00:27:25,045 --> 00:27:26,640
She's one of the good ones.

546
00:27:28,088 --> 00:27:31,171
I wish there was something
I could do for her.

547
00:27:35,546 --> 00:27:36,341
I...

548
00:27:39,236 --> 00:27:41,402
I know something you can do.

549
00:27:46,208 --> 00:27:48,113
I just want you to
know that I'm hurt.

550
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,681
I am hurt and I am angry,

551
00:27:50,936 --> 00:27:53,920
because I thought that we had something.
I thought that we were going somewhere.

552
00:27:54,085 --> 00:27:55,161
If you're just sleeping around,

553
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:56,623
if you're just making
the rounds of girl surgeons,

554
00:27:56,747 --> 00:27:58,482
then I think that
you ought to know that I

555
00:27:58,615 --> 00:28:00,210
We went to a fancy restaurant.

556
00:28:00,717 --> 00:28:02,920
- What?
- We went to a fancy restaurant,

557
00:28:03,127 --> 00:28:04,803
The nicest restaurant in Seattle.

558
00:28:05,118 --> 00:28:07,070
The salad that I ordered...
the salad

559
00:28:07,356 --> 00:28:09,100
cost $26.95. The wine

560
00:28:09,226 --> 00:28:10,942
that you ordered cost $125 a bottle

561
00:28:11,197 --> 00:28:12,643
I didn't even look at the entrees

562
00:28:12,766 --> 00:28:14,960
because I knew I wasn't gonna
be able to order one because

563
00:28:15,087 --> 00:28:17,653
I was already out 75 bucks,
and I don't even like salad.

564
00:28:19,485 --> 00:28:21,451
And then the bill came, and you...

565
00:28:22,397 --> 00:28:23,321
I paid.

566
00:28:23,496 --> 00:28:26,430
Do you know what I was doing
before they brought over the check?

567
00:28:27,268 --> 00:28:29,042
I was counting in my head

568
00:28:29,287 --> 00:28:30,643
trying to figure out

569
00:28:30,777 --> 00:28:32,722
how I was gonna buy food
for the rest of the week

570
00:28:32,848 --> 00:28:36,441
if my half was 75 bucks...
because I don't have 75 bucks

571
00:28:36,575 --> 00:28:38,330
because my father disowned me

572
00:28:38,615 --> 00:28:40,480
and has cleared out my bank account.

573
00:28:40,606 --> 00:28:41,613
I am broke.

574
00:28:42,078 --> 00:28:44,303
And I am exhausted, Arizona.

575
00:28:45,656 --> 00:28:48,552
I'm working in the E.R.
because I need the money.

576
00:28:51,135 --> 00:28:54,220
Six people died on my watch today,
and I am fried.

577
00:28:58,248 --> 00:29:00,630
I wanted to stay in last night.
I thought...

578
00:29:01,075 --> 00:29:03,943
I thought that last night
would be the night for us,

579
00:29:04,215 --> 00:29:05,943
you know, our night.

580
00:29:07,947 --> 00:29:09,920
But you wanted to go
to a fancy restaurant,

581
00:29:10,877 --> 00:29:12,071
I can't do that.

582
00:29:13,075 --> 00:29:14,892
- I can't.
- It's okay.

583
00:29:15,028 --> 00:29:16,731
It's okay. Hey.
So...

584
00:29:18,036 --> 00:29:19,122
we stay in.

585
00:29:20,066 --> 00:29:21,733
And we'll eat...

586
00:29:22,867 --> 00:29:23,981
Sandwiches.

587
00:29:24,316 --> 00:29:26,200
You don't even like sandwiches.

588
00:29:26,678 --> 00:29:29,472
But I like the girl
who has the sandwiches.

589
00:29:31,518 --> 00:29:32,463
Okay?

590
00:29:33,225 --> 00:29:34,051
Okay.

591
00:29:34,818 --> 00:29:37,481
No, you know what? I don't
like sandwiches either. I like pizza.

592
00:29:39,076 --> 00:29:40,351
I like pizza, too.

593
00:29:48,325 --> 00:29:49,411
Yes, sir.

594
00:29:50,137 --> 00:29:51,913
I've been reading
your mother's journals.

595
00:29:52,658 --> 00:29:54,293
I wish she was here today.

596
00:29:55,818 --> 00:29:58,081
I don't know how she would've
felt about me getting married.

597
00:29:58,206 --> 00:29:59,433
No, not for that.

598
00:30:00,055 --> 00:30:01,090
For this...

599
00:30:01,265 --> 00:30:02,460
Your first solo surgery.

600
00:30:03,347 --> 00:30:05,631
She probably would've said,
with all the mistakes I've made,

601
00:30:05,755 --> 00:30:08,380
- I'm lucky the patient's alive.
- That's right.

602
00:30:08,835 --> 00:30:10,830
But I also know
that she would've been thrilled.

603
00:30:11,538 --> 00:30:13,600
She wouldn't have been
able to tell you, but

604
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:15,001
she would've been.

605
00:30:15,516 --> 00:30:16,710
Thank you, sir.

606
00:30:23,736 --> 00:30:26,313
You... best wedding present ever.

607
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:28,730
And you know why?

608
00:30:31,618 --> 00:30:34,101
Because now I have to go home
and put on a corset

609
00:30:34,227 --> 00:30:35,720
and pantyhose and a petticoat

610
00:30:36,016 --> 00:30:38,780
and look like one of those idiots
on top of a wedding cake,

611
00:30:38,918 --> 00:30:41,883
and then I have to walk down the aisle
and have everyone staring at me.

612
00:30:42,045 --> 00:30:43,033
But it's okay,

613
00:30:43,166 --> 00:30:46,923
because I got to cut someone open today
from start to finish.

614
00:30:47,335 --> 00:30:48,562
I saved a life.

615
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:52,541
What?

616
00:30:53,987 --> 00:30:56,412
What do you say
we make this day even better?

617
00:31:01,858 --> 00:31:04,233
- Good work today, O'Malley.
- Good work?

618
00:31:05,218 --> 00:31:07,212
They're dead.
All those kids are dead.

619
00:31:07,346 --> 00:31:09,760
- Not all of them.
- The one I didn't touch is just fine.

620
00:31:09,888 --> 00:31:11,362
Because I was able to get to her.

621
00:31:11,485 --> 00:31:13,423
And the reason I was...
the only reason...

622
00:31:13,548 --> 00:31:15,051
is because I had you on my team.

623
00:31:15,266 --> 00:31:17,871
You saved that girl
today as much as I did.

624
00:31:22,407 --> 00:31:24,451
Trauma's a team sport, O'Malley.

625
00:31:24,586 --> 00:31:26,420
You don't have to be the hero.
You just...

626
00:31:29,017 --> 00:31:31,041
you just have to go
where you're needed.

627
00:31:43,138 --> 00:31:47,401
Bailey says Shepherd found another tumor
in Izzie's brain. Did you hear?

628
00:31:47,578 --> 00:31:48,420
I heard.

629
00:31:50,065 --> 00:31:52,073
He doesn't think
he's gonna get it out this time.

630
00:31:55,035 --> 00:31:56,121
I think...

631
00:32:03,128 --> 00:32:05,410
I think she's gonna die on me.

632
00:32:07,756 --> 00:32:09,890
I think she's really gonna die.

633
00:32:15,418 --> 00:32:18,333
What are you doing here? Aren't you
supposed to be getting ready for a wedding?

634
00:32:18,818 --> 00:32:20,843
That's what I came
to talk to you about.

635
00:32:28,088 --> 00:32:31,831
Hi. I'm dr. Grey. I'm gonna
take care of your central line.

636
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:42,302
You're crying.

637
00:32:43,307 --> 00:32:44,711
You're breathing.

638
00:32:56,168 --> 00:32:58,693
My shoes are, in the closet there.

639
00:33:00,906 --> 00:33:02,300
Shoes, right.

640
00:33:03,447 --> 00:33:05,911
You're supposed to be
helping me... get ready.

641
00:33:07,396 --> 00:33:11,032
I can still go, right? I mean,
the tumor's not going anywhere, so...

642
00:33:11,427 --> 00:33:13,981
- Yeah, you can go.
- Okay, well...

643
00:33:15,517 --> 00:33:16,963
We don't want to be late.

644
00:33:19,155 --> 00:33:20,652
Here she comes.

645
00:33:23,466 --> 00:33:25,110
You're supposed to be at the church.

646
00:33:25,247 --> 00:33:27,930
I'm going. I just came to say,
this isn't my dress.

647
00:33:28,165 --> 00:33:29,510
Of course it's your dress.

648
00:33:29,765 --> 00:33:31,091
It's perfect.

649
00:33:31,448 --> 00:33:33,772
- What are you talking about?
- No, this dress is not for me.

650
00:33:34,838 --> 00:33:36,133
- I don't...
- What?

651
00:33:37,517 --> 00:33:42,140
Oh, God. I knew you were
gonna freak out before the wedding.

652
00:33:42,807 --> 00:33:44,523
Derek loves you.

653
00:33:44,886 --> 00:33:46,141
Marriage is good.

654
00:33:46,515 --> 00:33:48,550
- Tell her it's good.
- No, she's saying...

655
00:33:49,166 --> 00:33:51,650
It's not her wedding dress.

656
00:33:55,797 --> 00:33:56,933
She's right.

657
00:33:58,765 --> 00:34:00,400
The dress isn't for Meredith.

658
00:34:34,756 --> 00:34:35,961
I don't...

659
00:34:37,626 --> 00:34:39,473
I don't even know how to...

660
00:34:40,035 --> 00:34:40,831
I...

661
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,082
Thank you.

662
00:34:46,427 --> 00:34:49,982
Okay. So who's
the maid of honor, me or Cristina?

663
00:34:50,106 --> 00:34:51,471
Cristina.

664
00:34:52,218 --> 00:34:56,532
Alex... he needs a best man,
and he was asking for you, so...

665
00:34:56,657 --> 00:34:58,723
So what, I'm leftovers?

666
00:34:59,228 --> 00:35:00,823
You tried to save my life.

667
00:35:01,927 --> 00:35:03,571
That makes you honorable.

668
00:35:58,268 --> 00:36:02,081
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today

669
00:36:02,205 --> 00:36:05,920
to celebrate the wedding
of Alexander Michael Karev

670
00:36:06,246 --> 00:36:08,830
and Isobel Catherine Stevens.

671
00:36:14,188 --> 00:36:16,173
This is a sacred rite,

672
00:36:16,838 --> 00:36:18,361
an ancient rite.

673
00:36:19,758 --> 00:36:23,663
As isobel and Alex
prepare to join their lives,

674
00:36:24,068 --> 00:36:26,300
it is important to understand

675
00:36:26,568 --> 00:36:28,081
that everyone present

676
00:36:28,216 --> 00:36:30,873
has played a part
in shaping their lives

677
00:36:31,396 --> 00:36:34,313
and will continue
to play a vital role

678
00:36:34,435 --> 00:36:36,432
in their continuing future.

679
00:36:36,557 --> 00:36:41,042
And thus, we are here not only
to witness their vows to each other,

680
00:36:42,088 --> 00:36:44,952
but to bestow
upon them our blessing.

681
00:36:48,835 --> 00:36:51,461
And now the couple
will read their vows.

682
00:36:52,038 --> 00:36:54,192
- We didn't write anything.
- No, wait. I have

683
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:56,120
something I want to say.

684
00:37:00,747 --> 00:37:03,090
Today's the day my life begins.

685
00:37:04,395 --> 00:37:08,683
All my life, I've been just me...
just a smart-mouth kid.

686
00:37:10,396 --> 00:37:12,190
Today I become a man.

687
00:37:13,635 --> 00:37:15,340
Today I become a husband.

688
00:37:16,635 --> 00:37:20,452
Today I become accountable
to someone other than myself.

689
00:37:21,898 --> 00:37:23,492
Today I become accountable to you,

690
00:37:24,558 --> 00:37:26,051
to our future,

691
00:37:26,588 --> 00:37:29,803
to all the possibilities
that our marriage has to offer.

692
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:34,120
Together, no matter what happens,

693
00:37:34,907 --> 00:37:36,162
I'll be ready...

694
00:37:37,446 --> 00:37:38,522
For anything...

695
00:37:39,567 --> 00:37:40,673
For everything...

696
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:43,893
To take on life,

697
00:37:44,226 --> 00:37:45,690
to take on love,

698
00:37:46,405 --> 00:37:49,322
to take on possibility
and responsibility.

699
00:37:50,725 --> 00:37:53,523
Today, Izzie Stevens,
our life together begins.

700
00:37:54,685 --> 00:37:56,333
And I, for one, can't wait.

701
00:37:57,785 --> 00:37:58,962
I love you.

702
00:38:01,575 --> 00:38:02,920
- Not yet.
- Hurry up.

703
00:38:04,067 --> 00:38:07,953
By the power vested in me
by God and the state of Washington,

704
00:38:08,288 --> 00:38:11,201
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

705
00:38:11,507 --> 00:38:12,560
- Now?
- Now.

706
00:39:07,325 --> 00:39:11,072
<i>You never know the biggest day
of your life is the biggest day...</i>

707
00:39:12,496 --> 00:39:14,580
<i>not until it's happening.</i>

708
00:39:34,798 --> 00:39:35,823
It's okay.

709
00:39:36,215 --> 00:39:37,731
It's just hair. You don't need it.

710
00:39:37,855 --> 00:39:39,410
It's just gonna keep falling out.

711
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,042
We'll shave it off.

712
00:39:41,167 --> 00:39:43,001
I bet you look good bald anyway.

713
00:39:44,036 --> 00:39:44,862
Okay?

714
00:39:56,626 --> 00:39:57,430
Stop.

715
00:39:58,196 --> 00:39:59,330
You're beautiful.

716
00:40:07,026 --> 00:40:09,440
<i>You don't recognize
the biggest day of your life,</i>

717
00:40:10,406 --> 00:40:12,193
<i>not until you're right</i>

718
00:40:12,806 --> 00:40:14,430
<i>in the middle of it.</i>

719
00:40:15,576 --> 00:40:18,330
<i>The day you commit
to something or...</i>

720
00:40:19,277 --> 00:40:20,380
<i>someone...</i>

721
00:40:26,305 --> 00:40:28,643
<i>the day you get your heart broken...</i>

722
00:40:32,027 --> 00:40:34,130
Best non-wedding day ever.

723
00:40:35,456 --> 00:40:37,073
Want to go again?

724
00:40:47,447 --> 00:40:49,740
<i>The day you meet your soul mate...</i>

725
00:40:53,155 --> 00:40:54,780
<i>the day you realize...</i>

726
00:40:55,838 --> 00:40:57,740
<i>There's not enough time...</i>

727
00:40:58,917 --> 00:41:01,080
<i>Because you want to live forever...</i>

728
00:41:03,035 --> 00:41:04,880
<i>Those are the biggest days...</i>

729
00:41:06,715 --> 00:41:08,462
<i>The perfect days...</i>

730
00:41:12,227 --> 00:41:13,192
you know?

731
00:41:15,758 --> 00:41:17,993
I bet you made a beautiful bride.

732
00:41:19,715 --> 00:41:21,260
It was a beautiful day.

733
00:41:24,146 --> 00:41:25,670
You put the scarf on.

734
00:41:25,795 --> 00:41:29,550
I told you, you don't need it.
You look gorgeous without it.

735
00:41:30,797 --> 00:41:32,001
He's right.

736
00:41:34,018 --> 00:41:35,150
Go away now.

737
00:41:36,898 --> 00:41:38,661
Go away.
I want to be alone...

738
00:41:39,356 --> 00:41:40,482
With my husband.

739
00:42:01,848 --> 00:42:03,312
My wife is hot.

740
