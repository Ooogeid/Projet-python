1
00:00:01,528 --> 00:00:02,767
We're doctors.

2
00:00:02,887 --> 00:00:05,083
We're trained to care for human beings.

3
00:00:05,497 --> 00:00:07,876
And we're pretty sure
we know what to look for.

4
00:00:07,888 --> 00:00:10,518
No, it doesn't make any sense, and...

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,784
and everybody wants a
kid, and you of all people,

6
00:00:12,785 --> 00:00:15,654
- you wear roller skates for shoes. I don't get it.
- You know what? I don't know.

7
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:17,623
Maybe there's something wrong with me.

8
00:00:17,657 --> 00:00:19,258
'Cause it's not natural. It's not womanly.

9
00:00:19,292 --> 00:00:22,127
- Maybe I'm cold and heartless and dead inside.
- No, I'm not saying that!

10
00:00:22,162 --> 00:00:24,269
- Well, yeah. But a little bit, you are.
- No. No.

11
00:00:24,304 --> 00:00:25,873
Cuts...

12
00:00:25,907 --> 00:00:27,548
Infection...

13
00:00:27,595 --> 00:00:29,568
Genetic mutation.

14
00:00:29,601 --> 00:00:32,366
You know what? Just...

15
00:00:32,401 --> 00:00:35,631
Just humor me for one minute, okay?

16
00:00:35,665 --> 00:00:37,064
Close your eyes.

17
00:00:37,099 --> 00:00:40,298
Close your eyes.

18
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:42,533
Now picture a baby.

19
00:00:44,501 --> 00:00:46,300
A warm...

20
00:00:46,335 --> 00:00:51,036
Smushy little... baby...

21
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,609
Wrapping its chubby little
arms around your neck

22
00:00:54,644 --> 00:00:57,145
and breathe in that...

23
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:00,218
That intoxicating baby smell.

24
00:01:03,057 --> 00:01:05,395
Doesn't it just melt you?

25
00:01:06,965 --> 00:01:08,398
Nope.

26
00:01:08,433 --> 00:01:10,266
You know what melts me?

27
00:01:10,301 --> 00:01:14,236
Spain, the beach, you in a
bikini, me holding a sangria.

28
00:01:14,271 --> 00:01:16,673
Oh, wait. What's that I hear?

29
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:19,978
Oh... Oh, the baby's
crying. We can't go to Spain.

30
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:22,413
A sangria? That's why I don't get a kid?

31
00:01:22,447 --> 00:01:24,748
So I can make you a friggin' sangria?

32
00:01:24,783 --> 00:01:27,183
- Just a minute. Just a minute! What?
- Yang, you got a suture Kit?

33
00:01:27,218 --> 00:01:29,152
- Uh, yeah.
- Where's Robbins?

34
00:01:29,186 --> 00:01:30,553
- Uh, in there.
- Robbins!

35
00:01:30,587 --> 00:01:32,722
What's going on? Wait,
two. I need two suture kits!

36
00:01:32,756 --> 00:01:34,457
- Why is he screaming?
- Baby. Now!

37
00:01:34,492 --> 00:01:36,828
Why are you...

38
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:38,296
Oh, God. He's serious.

39
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:42,902
Holy mother...

40
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:44,838
Get my bag. Get my bag. Get me a clamp.

41
00:01:44,872 --> 00:01:47,674
- Oh, God.
- All right. Another clamp.

42
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:49,876
- Clamp.
- Scissors.

43
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:53,347
- How is he? Is he okay? Is he good?
- He's great. You did great.

44
00:01:53,382 --> 00:01:56,317
- Oh, dad.
- All right.

45
00:01:56,352 --> 00:01:58,086
- Any sounds?
- Not yet.

46
00:01:58,121 --> 00:01:59,988
Okay.

47
00:02:00,023 --> 00:02:02,325
Come on, baby boy. Come on.

48
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:05,663
Come on, baby boy. Come on. Come on.

49
00:02:05,697 --> 00:02:07,699
Come on. Come on.

50
00:02:08,835 --> 00:02:11,303
Okay. That's my boy. Okay.

51
00:02:11,338 --> 00:02:14,207
That's what I'm talking about.
That's what I'm talking about.

52
00:02:14,241 --> 00:02:17,077
Here you go, grandpa.

53
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:39,734
Hey. So is it true, you
helped Teddy and Mark

54
00:02:39,768 --> 00:02:41,836
- deliver little Sloan's baby?
- Yeah. Not now.

55
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,470
What's wrong with you?

56
00:02:43,505 --> 00:02:45,672
Tom Evans... in with your husband.

57
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,674
That's Tom Evans?

58
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,676
He seems a lot younger than I would've...

59
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,445
- please try and be cool.
- Morning.

60
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,348
Hey. Hey, hey, hey. He's in with Shepherd.

61
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:56,450
- Who?
- Tom Evans.

62
00:02:56,485 --> 00:02:59,053
Tom Evans is... is here?

63
00:02:59,088 --> 00:03:02,290
- You didn't know?
- He's doing his bloodless cabage on a beating heart

64
00:03:02,324 --> 00:03:04,927
today in our O.R. What,
Shepherd didn't tell you?

65
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:07,062
No, no, he...

66
00:03:07,097 --> 00:03:08,497
Bless you. Bless you.

67
00:03:08,532 --> 00:03:11,501
- Excuse me. No, he didn't.
- An Evans bypass.

68
00:03:11,535 --> 00:03:14,237
Clear your schedule. Scrub in.

69
00:03:14,271 --> 00:03:16,572
Uh, no, I... I, uh, I
can't. I... I gotta go.

70
00:03:16,607 --> 00:03:18,974
And here she is.

71
00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:20,976
Your cruise director... Dr. Yang.

72
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:22,611
- Dr. Evans. Hi.
- Hi.

73
00:03:22,645 --> 00:03:25,347
Hello. Hi. Hi. I... I'm... Cristina Yang.

74
00:03:25,382 --> 00:03:28,450
- I... I'm a huge fan.
- She's a groupie, but you're gonna forgive her,

75
00:03:28,484 --> 00:03:30,752
because she's one of the
finest cardio resident's

76
00:03:30,786 --> 00:03:33,788
- you'll meet anywhere.
- Quite a recommendation. Are
you scrubbing in with me today?

77
00:03:33,823 --> 00:03:36,358
Yes. It's an honor and
a privilege. Uh, I...

78
00:03:36,392 --> 00:03:38,627
here are the patient charts
and, uh, the most recent labs.

79
00:03:38,662 --> 00:03:40,596
If there's anything else
you need, just ask me,

80
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,565
'cause I'll be around here
all day, following you.

81
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,801
- Um, if... if that's okay with you.
- Uh... she is a groupie. I like her.

82
00:03:44,836 --> 00:03:47,237
This is my wife, Dr. Meredith Grey.

83
00:03:47,271 --> 00:03:49,707
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Likewise. I hear great things.

84
00:03:49,741 --> 00:03:51,742
Of course, I hear them from
your husband, so grain of salt.

85
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,514
- Dr. Yang?
- Yes.

86
00:03:56,549 --> 00:03:59,050
- All yours.
- Oh, yes, of course. The
patient is right this way, sir.

87
00:03:59,085 --> 00:04:01,053
Think she's gonna drool on him?

88
00:04:01,087 --> 00:04:03,789
I think she is.

89
00:04:03,823 --> 00:04:05,791
Oh, okay. I gotta go. I'll see you soon.

90
00:04:05,825 --> 00:04:07,760
Is that Thomas Evans from Baylor?

91
00:04:07,794 --> 00:04:10,129
Yes, but don't get too excited.
He's only here for one case.

92
00:04:10,163 --> 00:04:11,997
Oh, are you sure? Because I overheard

93
00:04:12,032 --> 00:04:13,699
Chief Shepherd discussing the fact

94
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:15,668
that Dr. Altman doesn't
have a permanent contract.

95
00:04:15,702 --> 00:04:17,970
So it would actually be a really
genius move on the Chief's part

96
00:04:18,004 --> 00:04:20,706
- to go in and seize that opportunity to...
- Oh, here we go again.

97
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,208
- What?
- Shut up.

98
00:04:23,243 --> 00:04:25,277
- She thinks your husband walks on water.
- I don't.

99
00:04:25,311 --> 00:04:27,312
I don't. I, um...

100
00:04:27,346 --> 00:04:29,680
No, I'm... I mean, it's...
it's a professional thing.

101
00:04:29,715 --> 00:04:31,649
It's, um... it's a mentor thing.

102
00:04:31,683 --> 00:04:35,854
He's... he's just my mentor because
he's... he's married... to you.

103
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:40,426
And you guys are... are so great and, um,
together... together as a married couple,

104
00:04:40,461 --> 00:04:42,895
and you... you... you are so great.

105
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,197
Wow.

106
00:04:44,231 --> 00:04:47,768
I, um, I do... I do think
that your husband is brilliant,

107
00:04:47,802 --> 00:04:51,238
- but I'm... I'm sure that you think that, too, so...
- That's right.

108
00:04:51,272 --> 00:04:53,373
Okay. That, um...

109
00:04:53,408 --> 00:04:55,275
Thank you.

110
00:04:58,678 --> 00:05:00,579
You can see it, right?

111
00:05:00,613 --> 00:05:04,182
The... the resemblance?

112
00:05:04,216 --> 00:05:05,817
It's a newborn.

113
00:05:05,851 --> 00:05:08,519
It resembles other newborns.

114
00:05:08,554 --> 00:05:10,588
Okay. All right. Fine.

115
00:05:10,622 --> 00:05:12,524
But you want incontrovertible proof?

116
00:05:12,558 --> 00:05:15,427
Here we go.

117
00:05:15,461 --> 00:05:17,362
- Look at that.
- Oh.

118
00:05:17,397 --> 00:05:20,399
Well, it's impressive. I'll give you that.

119
00:05:20,433 --> 00:05:22,902
Well, I mean... I mean, a lot of
that swelling is from the birth.

120
00:05:22,936 --> 00:05:25,839
- It will go down.
- He's a Sloan.

121
00:05:25,873 --> 00:05:28,442
- Right.
- He's a Sloan.

122
00:05:38,853 --> 00:05:40,320
What is it?

123
00:05:40,354 --> 00:05:41,787
Trauma choppers.

124
00:05:41,821 --> 00:05:42,888
Nice.

125
00:05:42,922 --> 00:05:46,692
Hey, could you... could you hand me my...

126
00:05:46,726 --> 00:05:49,061
Oh, well, okay. Good morning.

127
00:05:51,197 --> 00:05:53,932
Good morning.

128
00:05:53,999 --> 00:05:58,303
Yes, it is. I have a trauma chopper 15
minutes out and a small window of time

129
00:05:58,337 --> 00:06:01,372
- where I can actually practice medicine.
- Right. Plus Thomas Evans is here.

130
00:06:01,407 --> 00:06:04,074
- He is. He's doing a coronary...
- Is he interviewing for my job?

131
00:06:04,108 --> 00:06:06,009
Because I've been waiting to hear about

132
00:06:06,043 --> 00:06:08,011
a permanent contract
from you, and I haven't.

133
00:06:08,045 --> 00:06:10,980
- And Thomas Evans is here...
- Teddy, temporary contract. You
said you were looking elsewhere.

134
00:06:11,014 --> 00:06:12,948
Yeah, I... I was, but I stopped.

135
00:06:12,983 --> 00:06:14,616
I didn't know that.

136
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,618
Oh, I'm sorry. I should've told you.

137
00:06:16,652 --> 00:06:19,387
Look, I'd be happy to consider
you for the permanent position.

138
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:22,489
- Consider me? For... for my job?
- I had to run a search.

139
00:06:22,523 --> 00:06:25,358
I can't get caught
without a head of cardio.

140
00:06:25,392 --> 00:06:28,227
Okay. Well, I... I...
I'd like to be considered.

141
00:06:28,261 --> 00:06:31,731
I'll throw you in the mix.

142
00:06:31,765 --> 00:06:33,999
Hey, the baby's sleeping.

143
00:06:34,034 --> 00:06:36,068
Um...

144
00:06:36,102 --> 00:06:39,471
Thank you for...

145
00:06:39,506 --> 00:06:41,173
everything.

146
00:06:41,207 --> 00:06:43,141
I'm happy to help.

147
00:06:43,176 --> 00:06:44,342
Dad.

148
00:06:44,377 --> 00:06:45,744
Hey.

149
00:06:45,778 --> 00:06:48,380
Everything's fine. The baby's doing great.

150
00:06:48,414 --> 00:06:51,550
Hey, can you grab my bag?

151
00:06:51,584 --> 00:06:53,185
Oh, yeah.

152
00:06:57,855 --> 00:07:00,590
What is all that?

153
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,092
You...

154
00:07:02,127 --> 00:07:05,495
Did you buy all this for the baby?

155
00:07:05,563 --> 00:07:10,699
Yeah. I figured he was gonna need
stuff, and I was already in the store.

156
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:12,300
I mean, I know it's lame.

157
00:07:12,334 --> 00:07:14,236
All the girl's stuff was way better.

158
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,471
But boys like army crap, right?

159
00:07:16,505 --> 00:07:18,473
Oh, no. Well, that's a choking hazard.

160
00:07:18,507 --> 00:07:20,641
And, well, he's a little young for that.

161
00:07:20,676 --> 00:07:22,910
And... and that.

162
00:07:22,945 --> 00:07:24,979
He's just a little young.

163
00:07:25,013 --> 00:07:27,714
Well, whatever. It doesn't
really matter anyway.

164
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:29,883
He's gonna be getting
a lot nicer stuff soon.

165
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:32,185
Here. Uh, this is the number

166
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,455
for the people that are gonna
adopt him... Trish and Keith.

167
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,023
Can you call 'em?

168
00:07:38,426 --> 00:07:40,193
Mark...

169
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:41,294
Yeah.

170
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:43,195
Do you want me to handle that call?

171
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:46,865
No, no. I'll take care of it.

172
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:51,935
It was a fishing boat
accident and two patients...

173
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,770
one with a head lac and abdominal pain,

174
00:07:53,805 --> 00:07:56,506
the other, they said something about
a fish hook being stuck somewhere.

175
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,941
Why would they send a chopper
for a guy with a fish hook?

176
00:07:58,976 --> 00:08:01,844
Uh, I'm pretty sure they said
fish hook, Chief Shepherd.

177
00:08:01,878 --> 00:08:04,079
Okay.

178
00:08:04,114 --> 00:08:06,214
"I'm pretty sure they said
fish hook, Chief Shepherd.

179
00:08:06,248 --> 00:08:08,649
- But if I'm wrong, you can spank me."
- Shut up.

180
00:08:08,684 --> 00:08:10,384
"Oh, Chief Shepherd, I do hope I'm wrong."

181
00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:11,785
What do we got?

182
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,954
Uh, I've got the son... head
laceration and crush injuries.

183
00:08:13,988 --> 00:08:16,356
- The dad's right behind. Let's go.
- Okay.

184
00:08:19,127 --> 00:08:22,429
50-year-old male, penetrating
trauma to the chest.

185
00:08:22,464 --> 00:08:26,867
Hypotensive in the field,
gotten 2 liters of L.R. en route.

186
00:08:26,902 --> 00:08:28,603
Oh!

187
00:08:28,637 --> 00:08:30,671
Big hook!

188
00:08:30,705 --> 00:08:33,073
Big hook!

189
00:08:40,427 --> 00:08:44,831
Mrs. Smitte, when is the last
time you took a flight of stairs

190
00:08:44,865 --> 00:08:47,200
- instead of an elevator?
- Oh, God, it's...

191
00:08:47,234 --> 00:08:48,701
it's been years.

192
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:51,438
This time next week, you're gonna do it.

193
00:08:51,472 --> 00:08:54,040
And your grandkids, you
have... you have grandkids?

194
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:57,310
- Two.
- They're not gonna know what hit 'em.

195
00:08:57,344 --> 00:09:00,313
- They won't be able to keep up with you.
- You mean it?

196
00:09:00,348 --> 00:09:02,282
I mean it. He means it.

197
00:09:02,316 --> 00:09:04,718
Excuse me. Sorry.

198
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:07,621
- Oh, hey. Come in, come in, come in.
- No.

199
00:09:07,655 --> 00:09:11,291
Why?

200
00:09:13,394 --> 00:09:16,062
- Okay, hold it steady. Grey, get in there.
- What do we have?

201
00:09:16,096 --> 00:09:18,197
- Oh, my God.
- Here we go.

202
00:09:18,232 --> 00:09:19,966
Fishing boat accident.

203
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,567
- Something fell on him.
- And the hook?

204
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,937
Looks like he fell on it.

205
00:09:23,971 --> 00:09:26,206
- Pressure's at 68 systolic.
- Tracheal deviation

206
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,575
and absent breath sounds.
Get me a 14-gauge needle.

207
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,377
- Right behind you.
- Dad.

208
00:09:30,412 --> 00:09:32,079
What are you doing to him?

209
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,381
- Grey, get him outta here.
- I'm trying. Doug, please.

210
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,584
Go on, son. I'm all right. Oh, God.

211
00:09:36,619 --> 00:09:39,220
- What is that? What the hell is that?
- Dad, I... I don't know what happened.

212
00:09:39,255 --> 00:09:41,690
- I had the rope in my hand one minute, and...
- Doug, Doug, come on.

213
00:09:41,724 --> 00:09:44,059
No, I did this. I... I'm
sorry. Dad, I'm so sorry.

214
00:09:44,093 --> 00:09:47,229
- It's... it's okay. It's not your fault.
- Of course it's his fault!

215
00:09:47,264 --> 00:09:49,232
I was thrown on top of this shark hook

216
00:09:49,266 --> 00:09:51,668
because he let go of the rope.

217
00:09:51,702 --> 00:09:53,804
Who the hell's fault is it?

218
00:09:53,838 --> 00:09:56,073
Let's leave the hook in until
we get him up to the O.R.

219
00:09:56,108 --> 00:09:57,908
I'm feeling a depressed skull fracture.

220
00:09:57,943 --> 00:10:01,012
- All right. Go ahead and order a head C.T.
- Right away, Chief.

221
00:10:01,047 --> 00:10:05,216
That was the first thing he
taught me when I joined the crew.

222
00:10:05,251 --> 00:10:07,552
I don't know how...

223
00:10:09,522 --> 00:10:12,157
We didn't play ball when I was little.

224
00:10:12,191 --> 00:10:14,559
We tied knots. I know
how to tie that knot.

225
00:10:14,594 --> 00:10:18,797
Doug, you made a mistake.
It was an accident.

226
00:10:18,832 --> 00:10:20,733
What if it wasn't?

227
00:10:20,767 --> 00:10:23,269
I've thought about it sometimes...

228
00:10:23,303 --> 00:10:26,839
Hitting him... or hurting him.

229
00:10:26,873 --> 00:10:29,775
He pisses me off sometimes
and he's harsh and...

230
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,978
are you telling us you
did this on purpose?

231
00:10:32,012 --> 00:10:34,180
No, not on purpose. I just...

232
00:10:34,214 --> 00:10:37,116
I don't... I don't feel so good.

233
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,585
Okay, just try to relax. Deep breaths.

234
00:10:39,619 --> 00:10:42,187
Deep breaths.

235
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:46,425
Okay, uh, Grey, order a head
C. T. and get a C.T. angio.

236
00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:49,695
I think I saw, uh, some
fluid around his spleen.

237
00:10:49,729 --> 00:10:52,864
I'll do it. Uh, I think there's some...

238
00:10:52,898 --> 00:10:57,702
and I'll just deal with the vomit.

239
00:10:59,237 --> 00:11:02,539
So, um, the nurse says
I'm being discharged?

240
00:11:02,573 --> 00:11:04,641
I have to leave tomorrow?

241
00:11:04,675 --> 00:11:06,710
I just had the baby, like, today.

242
00:11:06,744 --> 00:11:09,245
Well, that's a good thing.
It means you're doing great.

243
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,179
No complications.

244
00:11:11,214 --> 00:11:12,647
Right, little man?

245
00:11:12,682 --> 00:11:15,650
Well, where am I supposed
to go? My mom kicked me out,

246
00:11:15,684 --> 00:11:18,219
and those friends I was staying
with in Portland were like,

247
00:11:18,253 --> 00:11:21,022
"you gotta pay rent or you gotta leave"...

248
00:11:21,057 --> 00:11:24,760
And... I can't pay
rent. I don't have a job.

249
00:11:24,794 --> 00:11:27,028
I don't have anything.

250
00:11:27,063 --> 00:11:28,797
You can stay with me.

251
00:11:28,831 --> 00:11:30,499
Really?

252
00:11:30,533 --> 00:11:33,402
Sure. Just until you figure things out.

253
00:11:35,338 --> 00:11:38,774
You're gonna be okay. Sloans are tough.

254
00:11:38,808 --> 00:11:42,412
You hear that? We're tough.

255
00:11:42,446 --> 00:11:44,781
Um...

256
00:11:44,815 --> 00:11:49,419
Maybe we should... keep him.

257
00:11:51,622 --> 00:11:54,824
Do you think you could?

258
00:11:54,859 --> 00:11:57,493
Maybe.

259
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,297
You want to hold him?

260
00:12:01,331 --> 00:12:04,400
No. I... I don't think I know how to...

261
00:12:04,435 --> 00:12:08,571
Do you want to hold
him? He's pretty great.

262
00:12:08,606 --> 00:12:10,273
Look who it is.

263
00:12:10,307 --> 00:12:11,774
Hi, baby.

264
00:12:14,544 --> 00:12:16,612
Look at that.

265
00:12:16,646 --> 00:12:19,648
You're a natural.

266
00:12:19,683 --> 00:12:21,684
It's up to you.

267
00:12:21,718 --> 00:12:26,021
If you think we can do this, raise him...

268
00:12:26,056 --> 00:12:27,490
together...

269
00:12:27,524 --> 00:12:30,760
if you think we can, then...

270
00:12:30,794 --> 00:12:32,862
Hey, guys.

271
00:12:32,896 --> 00:12:35,198
He really needs to go to
the nursery to be monitored

272
00:12:35,232 --> 00:12:36,665
and get his newborn checkup.

273
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,900
I'm monitoring, and I did the exams.

274
00:12:38,935 --> 00:12:40,668
He's all good.

275
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:48,475
Mark, when you get a minute,
I'd love to have a quick word.

276
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,514
Hmm. Caught a big one, huh?

277
00:12:54,548 --> 00:12:56,016
That's funny.

278
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,885
He's got a small hematoma.

279
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:00,053
Hey, can I ask you something?

280
00:13:00,088 --> 00:13:01,788
Why did you hire Altman?

281
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,690
What'd you see in her?

282
00:13:03,725 --> 00:13:05,592
Well, what do you see in her?

283
00:13:05,627 --> 00:13:08,229
I think she's good. She works hard.

284
00:13:08,263 --> 00:13:09,731
I feel bad even looking.

285
00:13:09,765 --> 00:13:12,934
I'll feel worse, though, letting
a stronger candidate pass us by.

286
00:13:12,969 --> 00:13:15,037
Not the feel-good job, is it?

287
00:13:15,071 --> 00:13:17,472
Can't you give me a little insight?

288
00:13:17,507 --> 00:13:19,708
No. See, that'd be doing the job for you.

289
00:13:19,742 --> 00:13:21,976
I'm not gonna give you the fish.

290
00:13:22,011 --> 00:13:24,511
You got a big hook in there.

291
00:13:24,546 --> 00:13:27,181
Learn to fish yourself.

292
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,818
What kinda life is that,

293
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:34,753
living five months at a time on a boat,

294
00:13:34,788 --> 00:13:39,892
working 20 hours in terrible conditions?

295
00:13:39,926 --> 00:13:42,027
In 2007, the C.D.C. marked crab fishing

296
00:13:42,062 --> 00:13:46,264
the most dangerous job in the
U.S. , with an annual fatality rate

297
00:13:46,299 --> 00:13:49,201
28 times higher than any other job. What?

298
00:13:49,235 --> 00:13:52,103
Dude, it's like working with Forrest Gump.

299
00:13:52,138 --> 00:13:54,572
The kid's 15.

300
00:13:54,607 --> 00:13:58,443
He should be doing algebra,
going to school dances.

301
00:13:58,477 --> 00:14:00,378
How much you bet he did it?

302
00:14:00,446 --> 00:14:01,312
What?

303
00:14:01,346 --> 00:14:03,248
Hooked his old man on purpose.

304
00:14:03,282 --> 00:14:09,254
I'd say 70%, it was an
accident, 30% attempted murder.

305
00:14:09,288 --> 00:14:10,688
What? Karev's right.

306
00:14:10,723 --> 00:14:13,191
Too much nature makes people crazy.

307
00:14:13,225 --> 00:14:16,494
Ah, okay. There... is the tear.

308
00:14:16,528 --> 00:14:19,964
Grey, you want to embolize it?

309
00:14:19,999 --> 00:14:22,234
Really? I've never done it before,

310
00:14:22,268 --> 00:14:24,136
but I... I read that if you use...

311
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:26,706
You want this kid to
bleed to death or what?

312
00:14:27,674 --> 00:14:30,544
Don't analyze everything.

313
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,280
Just... do it.

314
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,418
- Tell me that you called the parents.
- Sloan's having second thoughts.

315
00:14:37,452 --> 00:14:39,587
Sloan picked those parents.
She asked you to call them.

316
00:14:39,621 --> 00:14:43,124
She was pretty clear.
- Well, now she's not clear. By law, she's got 48 hours

317
00:14:43,158 --> 00:14:45,693
- before the court terminates her parental right.
- Sloan changed her mind?

318
00:14:45,727 --> 00:14:47,094
- Maybe.
- That's great.

319
00:14:47,129 --> 00:14:49,096
- No, it's not.
- What, she can't change her mind?

320
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:52,365
- People change their minds.
- This baby needs parents,
not an 18-year-old child

321
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,467
- and a father who she met five minutes ago.
- Shut up!

322
00:14:54,502 --> 00:14:56,002
Mark... no.

323
00:14:56,036 --> 00:14:59,273
You know, you don't get
to tell me what to do here.

324
00:14:59,307 --> 00:15:03,277
I appreciate your help, but you don't...

325
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,615
my mom is dead.

326
00:15:06,649 --> 00:15:09,685
My dad's never gonna
get off the couch again.

327
00:15:09,719 --> 00:15:12,321
I don't have any brothers or sisters.

328
00:15:12,356 --> 00:15:15,058
This is my grandson...

329
00:15:15,092 --> 00:15:16,560
my grandson.

330
00:15:16,594 --> 00:15:18,996
I'm not just gonna turn
him over to some strangers

331
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:21,130
when I might have a chance at a family.

332
00:15:21,165 --> 00:15:25,401
So just... give me a minute here.

333
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,872
- How's he doing?
- His temp's high. I... I can't figure out why.

334
00:15:33,907 --> 00:15:35,708
Is his dad in surgery yet?

335
00:15:35,742 --> 00:15:37,676
Yeah, they're prepping him now.

336
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:41,346
Doug, would you like to see your
dad before he goes into surgery?

337
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,747
He's probably calmed down.

338
00:15:42,781 --> 00:15:44,215
He hates me.

339
00:15:44,249 --> 00:15:46,884
He's always hated me.

340
00:15:46,918 --> 00:15:49,353
And now I practically killed him.

341
00:15:49,387 --> 00:15:52,423
He doesn't want to see me.

342
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:57,394
Once when I was little,

343
00:15:57,428 --> 00:16:02,633
I was really mad at my mom, and... I
had heard that saccharine can kill you,

344
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:05,369
and so... I swear to
God, I almost put, like,

345
00:16:05,404 --> 00:16:08,106
ten packets of sweet'n low into
her coffee all at the same time.

346
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,774
I w... I was this close.

347
00:16:09,809 --> 00:16:12,077
And while she was thinking of
sweetening her mom's coffee,

348
00:16:12,111 --> 00:16:14,847
I tried to run my old man
over with a car. It's normal.

349
00:16:14,881 --> 00:16:17,817
No, that's... that's not normal.

350
00:16:18,953 --> 00:16:22,122
Those hooks were meant to catch sharks.

351
00:16:22,156 --> 00:16:24,692
He's never letting me
near him or the boat again.

352
00:16:24,726 --> 00:16:26,927
I don't even know where
I'm supposed to go.

353
00:16:26,961 --> 00:16:30,497
Ow. Ow, my head is, like, pounding.

354
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,901
Hey, we should get blood
cultures and a repeat C.B.C.

355
00:16:34,936 --> 00:16:36,903
We need to find out why he's burning up.

356
00:16:36,937 --> 00:16:38,338
You do that, Sweet'N Low.

357
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,339
I'm gonna go watch them pull out a hook.

358
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:47,780
The baby smiled at Mark.

359
00:16:47,815 --> 00:16:50,951
He looked up and smiled
at him like he knew him.

360
00:16:50,985 --> 00:16:54,121
That poor baby's parents,

361
00:16:54,155 --> 00:16:56,824
just sitting... stop
calling them the baby's...

362
00:16:56,859 --> 00:16:58,593
that baby's parents...

363
00:16:58,627 --> 00:17:02,298
The mature, capable, financially secure,

364
00:17:02,332 --> 00:17:05,435
emotionally stable, loving parents,

365
00:17:05,469 --> 00:17:08,438
who were deemed fit by Sloan
and the state of Washington,

366
00:17:08,472 --> 00:17:10,940
are sitting there by the telephone

367
00:17:10,975 --> 00:17:14,944
staring at the sky blue nursery
walls that they just painted.

368
00:17:14,979 --> 00:17:16,779
Those are the parents.

369
00:17:16,814 --> 00:17:19,516
Not Mr. midlife crisis and his teenage kid

370
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:22,151
who... who bought her
infant son a bag of lollipops

371
00:17:22,186 --> 00:17:25,188
and juicy couture onesies.
So she has a lot to learn.

372
00:17:25,222 --> 00:17:27,991
No, she doesn't.

373
00:17:28,025 --> 00:17:32,095
She made the one sound parenting
decision she needs to make.

374
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:34,531
She found a lovely
couple to raise her baby.

375
00:17:34,566 --> 00:17:38,536
And she did that months ago, when she
wasn't flooded with postpartum hormones

376
00:17:38,571 --> 00:17:42,674
or... or overwhelmed by
heartfelt pleas from her dad,

377
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:47,245
when she had time to think clearly...

378
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,082
About what was right for her and...
and what was right for the baby.

379
00:17:51,116 --> 00:17:51,835
She made a decision, a good decision.

380
00:17:51,869 --> 00:17:53,770
And it would... it would be great
if we cold just try and respect that.

381
00:18:01,565 --> 00:18:04,233
crap. Sloan.

382
00:18:08,138 --> 00:18:10,906
- Is he okay?
- I... I don't know. Uh, he won't stop crying.

383
00:18:10,941 --> 00:18:13,476
- Well, what happened?
- I... I don't know. I was just holding him,

384
00:18:14,881 --> 00:18:17,683
- and he's not stopping, and I think something's wrong.
- What happened?

385
00:18:17,718 --> 00:18:20,653
- Sloan got worried. She paged
us. But the baby's fine.
- Oh, he's just hungry is all.

386
00:18:20,687 --> 00:18:22,988
No, I... I don't know
how to do this. I don't...

387
00:18:23,023 --> 00:18:25,658
- You can't do it wrong, and
we're right here if you need help.
- No, no, no, he's crying.

388
00:18:25,692 --> 00:18:29,995
I... I don't think... I don't
think he wants me to do it. Please.

389
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:32,832
Here. Oh, God. I don't feel so good.

390
00:18:32,866 --> 00:18:34,500
Well, you've been up all night.

391
00:18:34,534 --> 00:18:37,336
You're exhausted and
dehydrated. Drink that.

392
00:18:43,076 --> 00:18:45,711
Thought I'd check to
see how far along we are.

393
00:18:45,746 --> 00:18:47,747
Almost ready to extract the hook.

394
00:18:47,781 --> 00:18:49,915
Suction. After they get him off the hook,

395
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,751
we'll go in to evacuate the hematoma

396
00:18:51,785 --> 00:18:53,719
and plate the skull fragments, right?

397
00:18:53,754 --> 00:18:56,222
No, I thought we'd throw him
back in. Catch and release.

398
00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:01,093
Thank you, Dr. Kepner.

399
00:19:01,128 --> 00:19:03,262
Well, Walter's lucky.

400
00:19:03,296 --> 00:19:05,598
It looks like he doesn't
have to lose any lung.

401
00:19:05,632 --> 00:19:07,666
- Yeah, no thanks to his kid.
- Mm.

402
00:19:07,701 --> 00:19:09,635
Well, it was an accident. That happens.

403
00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:12,037
That kid shouldn't have been
there in the first place.

404
00:19:12,072 --> 00:19:14,006
Well, he's the guy's
son... family business.

405
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,909
- There's something to be said for loyalty.
- You put a person in a job like that

406
00:19:16,943 --> 00:19:19,145
because they have the skills to handle it,

407
00:19:19,179 --> 00:19:21,280
not because they're
your friend or your kid.

408
00:19:21,314 --> 00:19:23,215
Are you intentionally equating me

409
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,118
with the idiot son that
dropped the crab cage on his dad

410
00:19:26,153 --> 00:19:29,021
or is that just a happy coincidence?

411
00:19:29,055 --> 00:19:30,656
All right.

412
00:19:34,154 --> 00:19:38,023
- All right, nobody move but Dr. Hunt.
- On my count.

413
00:19:38,057 --> 00:19:40,459
One...

414
00:19:40,493 --> 00:19:42,394
Two...

415
00:19:46,332 --> 00:19:47,966
- Snagged an artery...
- I'm sorry. I'm... I'm sorry.

416
00:19:48,001 --> 00:19:50,235
God bless you.

417
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,002
He's stabilized and ready for you.

418
00:20:00,037 --> 00:20:01,771
Mm-hmm.

419
00:20:01,805 --> 00:20:03,706
I'm sorry.

420
00:20:07,344 --> 00:20:11,881
Look, if this doesn't go your way,
please don't take it personally.

421
00:20:11,915 --> 00:20:13,783
You're an incredible surgeon. I see that.

422
00:20:13,817 --> 00:20:17,653
It's just that Evans has
published dozens of times.

423
00:20:17,688 --> 00:20:19,088
He's won awards.

424
00:20:19,122 --> 00:20:21,824
She won a bronze star for
service to her country.

425
00:20:21,858 --> 00:20:24,026
Does that not count?

426
00:20:37,207 --> 00:20:39,575
And the anastomosis is done.

427
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,510
Fine suture hook.

428
00:20:41,545 --> 00:20:43,846
- You're not using a side clamp?
- Nah.

429
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,281
It's a special technique.

430
00:20:45,315 --> 00:20:49,118
I get a very clean... very
nice anastomosis this way.

431
00:20:49,152 --> 00:20:51,687
Much less trauma to the
surrounding structures.

432
00:20:51,722 --> 00:20:54,056
You just parachuted that vein graft down.

433
00:20:54,091 --> 00:20:57,393
I... is that to avoid memory in
the suture or tangles later on?

434
00:20:57,427 --> 00:21:00,162
Excellent observation, Yang.

435
00:21:00,197 --> 00:21:03,599
- Have you already applied for your fellowships?
- Oh, I'm only in third year.

436
00:21:03,634 --> 00:21:05,334
Oh, right. I forgot.

437
00:21:05,369 --> 00:21:07,470
It feels like I'm working with a fellow.

438
00:21:08,972 --> 00:21:10,473
Thank you.

439
00:21:10,507 --> 00:21:13,376
Oh, would you like me
to cut the last suture?

440
00:21:16,535 --> 00:21:18,803
Wow.

441
00:21:18,837 --> 00:21:21,472
It looks like you've
barely operated at all.

442
00:21:21,506 --> 00:21:22,873
It's... it's so perfect.

443
00:21:22,908 --> 00:21:24,809
Well, that is the goal, Dr. Yang.

444
00:21:24,843 --> 00:21:26,310
That is the goal.

445
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:32,583
Excellent.

446
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:40,391
Hook guy is stable for now. How's the kid?

447
00:21:39,605 --> 00:21:42,540
Crappy. Nothing to do now that
we've finished with the angio.

448
00:21:42,575 --> 00:21:44,075
Lexie's babysitting him.

449
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:46,578
Hey. Have you, uh, seen Evans?

450
00:21:46,612 --> 00:21:48,480
It was amazing. Who saw?

451
00:21:48,514 --> 00:21:53,184
Dude, you're like a kid with trading
cards, except with heart surgeons.

452
00:21:53,219 --> 00:21:55,287
Yeah. I gotta have 'em all.

453
00:21:55,321 --> 00:21:57,355
I thought Teddy was the love of your life.

454
00:21:57,423 --> 00:21:59,324
Oh, she is. She is.

455
00:21:59,358 --> 00:22:01,559
But... Evans? Brilliant.
I mean, brilliant.

456
00:22:01,594 --> 00:22:05,964
I mean, so is she.
But... I love them both.

457
00:22:05,998 --> 00:22:07,632
I'm a cardiothoracic whore.

458
00:22:07,667 --> 00:22:09,567
What can I say? It feels so good.

459
00:22:09,602 --> 00:22:11,569
Speaking of whores, has anyone seen

460
00:22:11,604 --> 00:22:13,605
the love-struck intern
fawning over my husband?

461
00:22:13,639 --> 00:22:16,574
- April's not an intern.
- You bat your eyes like that, you're an intern.

462
00:22:16,609 --> 00:22:19,277
Oh, don't worry. That's not Derek's thing.

463
00:22:19,312 --> 00:22:22,881
- Anymore.
- I was the love-struck intern. It is his thing.

464
00:22:22,915 --> 00:22:25,483
- No, he's grown out of it.
- Out of what, chicks who shave their legs

465
00:22:25,518 --> 00:22:28,386
and laugh at his jokes?
Sure he's grown out of it.

466
00:22:28,454 --> 00:22:31,356
I shave my legs.

467
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:33,024
Sometimes.

468
00:22:35,618 --> 00:22:38,453
I don't make the rules. I'm
just telling you, it's a thing.

469
00:22:38,487 --> 00:22:41,256
- Powerful guys like adoring girls.
- Oh, my...

470
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:43,691
Look, whatever. Do what you want.

471
00:22:46,762 --> 00:22:48,696
Oh.

472
00:22:48,731 --> 00:22:50,932
- That baby's delicious.
- Yeah.

473
00:22:50,966 --> 00:22:53,334
I was thinking I could
take paternity leave.

474
00:22:53,369 --> 00:22:55,770
You know, at least for a couple of weeks.

475
00:22:55,805 --> 00:22:58,206
I could help Sloan get the hang of things.

476
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,642
I don't know if a couple
of weeks is enough.

477
00:23:00,676 --> 00:23:03,077
What? She's a good kid.
She's got good instincts.

478
00:23:03,112 --> 00:23:07,415
Well, her instincts led her to
put the baby up for adoption.

479
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:09,050
I don't know.

480
00:23:09,084 --> 00:23:12,720
She's unformed. She's a baby herself.

481
00:23:12,755 --> 00:23:15,590
I don't know.

482
00:23:15,624 --> 00:23:17,892
Yeah.

483
00:23:17,927 --> 00:23:20,562
I don't know either.

484
00:23:20,596 --> 00:23:23,131
Arizona wants to go to Spain.

485
00:23:23,165 --> 00:23:27,101
She's picking a suntan over
a family, which I don't get.

486
00:23:27,136 --> 00:23:29,537
Didn't she have, like, a
happy, idyllic childhood?

487
00:23:29,572 --> 00:23:31,873
Totally. She talks to
her parents every day...

488
00:23:31,907 --> 00:23:33,274
every day.

489
00:23:33,309 --> 00:23:35,343
Part of which could be the brother thing.

490
00:23:35,377 --> 00:23:36,744
What brother thing?

491
00:23:36,779 --> 00:23:39,447
He died.

492
00:23:44,353 --> 00:23:47,255
Her brother died.

493
00:23:47,289 --> 00:23:49,591
And I'm an idiot.

494
00:24:09,563 --> 00:24:10,930
You have a cold.

495
00:24:10,965 --> 00:24:13,233
It could've happened to any of us.

496
00:24:13,267 --> 00:24:16,169
Yeah, but it didn't.

497
00:24:16,203 --> 00:24:17,737
It was me...

498
00:24:17,772 --> 00:24:22,142
on a day that Shepherd is
interviewing Evans for my job.

499
00:24:22,176 --> 00:24:25,412
And... I'm the new girl
here who no one really knows.

500
00:24:25,446 --> 00:24:28,581
And even Yang... is in love with Evans.

501
00:24:28,616 --> 00:24:30,717
And I...

502
00:24:30,751 --> 00:24:34,054
Ugh! I have a freaking cold.

503
00:24:48,936 --> 00:24:50,537
It's okay.

504
00:24:50,571 --> 00:24:52,305
You're gonna be okay.

505
00:25:19,135 --> 00:25:20,368
Okay, what happened?

506
00:25:20,403 --> 00:25:22,838
He became lethargic and
febrile, coughed up blood.

507
00:25:22,872 --> 00:25:25,207
His sats dropped out. His X-ray shows

508
00:25:25,241 --> 00:25:28,610
- there's a large hemothorax where we took the hook out.
- All right. Well, then we're gonna have to go back in.

509
00:25:28,644 --> 00:25:31,113
- The repairs must not have held.
- You should get a C.T. to confirm

510
00:25:31,147 --> 00:25:34,015
- before cutting into a patient that's unstable.
- There's no time for that. You wait,

511
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:36,518
and he could go into
multi-system organ failure.

512
00:25:36,552 --> 00:25:39,521
Shepherd, you have to trust
that I know what I'm doing.

513
00:25:41,357 --> 00:25:44,259
I'll call up to the O.R.
let 'em know you're coming.

514
00:25:46,095 --> 00:25:49,397
Yes, this is Chief Shepherd.
We're gonna need a cardiac O.R.

515
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:53,401
Hey, what's up?

516
00:25:53,435 --> 00:25:54,902
Doug has fever and rigors,

517
00:25:54,936 --> 00:25:57,805
- and he's starting to get a productive cough.
- So deal with it.

518
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:00,341
Look, hook guy is tanking. He
coughed up blood or something,

519
00:26:00,375 --> 00:26:03,277
- so they're taking him back to surgery. I want in.
- Wait. He... he coughed up
blood. What did it look like?

520
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:05,479
Was it like currant jelly?
Did he have leukocytosis

521
00:26:05,514 --> 00:26:07,815
with a left shift? His
PACO2 was 28, right?

522
00:26:07,849 --> 00:26:09,316
I don't know, encyclopedia brown.

523
00:26:09,351 --> 00:26:10,851
I didn't memorize the chart.

524
00:26:10,886 --> 00:26:13,888
Let him go, Grey. He has
a surgery he wants to see.

525
00:26:13,922 --> 00:26:16,924
Thank you, Dr. Bailey.

526
00:26:16,958 --> 00:26:19,794
Dr. Bailey, both patients
have productive coughs

527
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,929
and signs and symptoms of sepsis.

528
00:26:21,963 --> 00:26:25,666
I am probably wrong, but if
I'm not, this is infectious.

529
00:26:25,701 --> 00:26:27,568
You're probably not wrong.
You're probably right.

530
00:26:27,602 --> 00:26:30,504
Why do you want to hand
your big save over to Karev,

531
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:32,339
who's gonna March around
the hospital acting like

532
00:26:32,374 --> 00:26:34,608
- he put it together?
- I didn't. I...

533
00:26:34,643 --> 00:26:39,213
You are handing your power over to
a boy because he's giving you sex.

534
00:26:39,247 --> 00:26:40,648
I'm not. I... I...

535
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:43,084
I'm Dr. Bailey. I know everything.

536
00:26:43,118 --> 00:26:44,919
And you have a superpower.

537
00:26:44,953 --> 00:26:47,755
That memory of yours is a superpower.

538
00:26:47,789 --> 00:26:51,058
And on top of it, you're a good doctor.

539
00:26:51,093 --> 00:26:52,993
And yet, you're letting Alex Karev

540
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,795
treat you like a scut monkey.

541
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,731
I don't care how good the sex is.

542
00:26:56,765 --> 00:26:59,366
- If that's what it costs, you're paying too much.
- I'm... I'm not...

543
00:26:59,401 --> 00:27:01,168
Scut monkey, all day.

544
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:03,104
Doctor.

545
00:27:03,138 --> 00:27:04,972
Thank you.

546
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,175
I was right.

547
00:27:18,687 --> 00:27:21,088
Karev, what's the status on your patient?

548
00:27:21,123 --> 00:27:23,357
Temperature spiked, but
the dude's doing fine.

549
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:25,526
We're running new labs. Dr. Altman, stop.

550
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:27,662
Dr. Grey, you always shout at people

551
00:27:27,696 --> 00:27:30,865
- right before they start operating?
- Doug has klebsiella pneumonia.

552
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,700
And I'm guessing Walter here does, too.

553
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,602
We need to start to imipenem, stat,

554
00:27:34,636 --> 00:27:36,304
or things could get ugly fast. Klebsiella?

555
00:27:36,338 --> 00:27:38,539
It's highly contagious in close quarters,

556
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:40,441
like living on a crab
boat for months at a time.

557
00:27:40,475 --> 00:27:42,910
And I think that hemothorax is a
mixture of blood and an empyema.

558
00:27:42,945 --> 00:27:44,912
Thanks for the heads-up.

559
00:27:44,947 --> 00:27:47,281
- Yeah, well, you were busy.
- Maybe we should open him to check anyway.

560
00:27:47,316 --> 00:27:49,483
No, I, um...

561
00:27:49,518 --> 00:27:51,986
I... I think I was wrong here.

562
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:55,690
Get him out of the O.R.
, into the I.C.U. now.

563
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,061
Oh.

564
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,462
This day has to end.

565
00:28:01,496 --> 00:28:02,864
Oh, tell me about it.

566
00:28:02,898 --> 00:28:05,299
I was supposed to watch Tom Evans work.

567
00:28:05,334 --> 00:28:08,236
Meanwhile, I got stuck in an O.R. all day

568
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,638
watching Teddy Altman decompose
right in front of my eyes.

569
00:28:10,672 --> 00:28:12,907
I don't understand. What's
Tom Evans doing here?

570
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,176
Taking a look around.

571
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:17,044
Why? You don't need Evans. You got Teddy.

572
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:19,580
I don't need Teddy if I've got Evans.

573
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:23,751
What? No, you... you can't.
Me and... me and Teddy, w...

574
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:27,054
Oh, God. See, this is my point exactly.

575
00:28:26,383 --> 00:28:29,385
I can't staff this
hospital, based on the fact

576
00:28:29,386 --> 00:28:32,354
that she's Hunt's friend
and your flavor of the month.

577
00:28:32,389 --> 00:28:35,424
You know what? I'm just
sick of worrying about this.

578
00:28:35,458 --> 00:28:38,060
- This job is exhausting.
- I'm sorry. That's what you're complaining about?

579
00:28:38,094 --> 00:28:39,528
Screw you.

580
00:28:39,563 --> 00:28:41,297
I'm losing everything today.

581
00:28:41,331 --> 00:28:43,065
Everything!

582
00:28:50,173 --> 00:28:52,041
Go ahead.

583
00:28:54,644 --> 00:28:57,546
How am I supposed to
call a couple of strangers

584
00:28:57,581 --> 00:29:00,482
and tell 'em to come take my kid?

585
00:29:00,517 --> 00:29:03,085
Sloan's your kid, Mark.

586
00:29:04,588 --> 00:29:06,155
You're not losing her.

587
00:29:06,189 --> 00:29:09,024
They're not taking her.

588
00:29:12,996 --> 00:29:16,498
Hey! Did you see me in the O.R.?

589
00:29:16,533 --> 00:29:17,933
You're an idiot.

590
00:29:17,968 --> 00:29:21,170
- What?
- You really think that Evans is gonna take you under

591
00:29:21,204 --> 00:29:23,005
his award-winning wing? He won't.

592
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,708
He doesn't need you. He
doesn't care about students.

593
00:29:25,742 --> 00:29:27,676
He's a rock star, not a teacher.

594
00:29:27,711 --> 00:29:30,079
He is a rock star. Teddy,
he's totally a rock star.

595
00:29:30,113 --> 00:29:32,514
I mean, did you see him in there?

596
00:29:32,549 --> 00:29:34,350
He was like an octopus
doing a million things,

597
00:29:34,384 --> 00:29:36,919
like cutting, retracting, suctioning
all at once. You think that I need you

598
00:29:36,953 --> 00:29:38,854
to hold my instruments when I operate?

599
00:29:38,888 --> 00:29:41,290
You think that helps me save the patient?

600
00:29:41,324 --> 00:29:43,225
I do it so that you can learn, Cristina.

601
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:46,195
I'd be a lot faster in
the O. R. without you.

602
00:29:47,706 --> 00:29:49,841
Your gloves were totally
clean at the end of surgery.

603
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:51,943
- Did you learn a lot?
- Teddy, it was one surgery.

604
00:29:51,977 --> 00:29:54,979
He's here for my job, Cristina.

605
00:29:55,014 --> 00:29:56,881
Do you really not get that?

606
00:29:56,915 --> 00:29:59,283
If Evans is in, I'm out. So, you know...

607
00:29:59,318 --> 00:30:02,520
good luck with your new attending.

608
00:30:09,395 --> 00:30:10,862
I get it.

609
00:30:17,436 --> 00:30:20,705
You watch parents go through...

610
00:30:20,739 --> 00:30:24,142
Horrible... unimaginable pain,

611
00:30:24,176 --> 00:30:26,144
every day.

612
00:30:26,178 --> 00:30:31,115
And... you went through horrible,
unimaginable pain when you lost your brother.

613
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:33,618
And your parents never got over it.

614
00:30:33,652 --> 00:30:36,621
But if we had a baby...

615
00:30:36,655 --> 00:30:40,124
our baby's not gonna be one
of those kids in your NICU.

616
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,494
Our baby won't be your brother.

617
00:30:43,529 --> 00:30:45,830
I mean, knock on wood, but...

618
00:30:47,299 --> 00:30:50,535
Do you know how happy our baby would be?

619
00:30:53,005 --> 00:30:55,106
I'm gonna say this once...

620
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:58,643
and then I'm not gonna say it again.

621
00:30:58,677 --> 00:31:01,379
I'm not broken. I'm not some psychodrama.

622
00:31:01,413 --> 00:31:03,347
My lack of interest in having a child

623
00:31:05,985 --> 00:31:08,253
pat yourself on the back
for having diagnosed.

624
00:31:08,287 --> 00:31:10,555
I like my life. I like
it the way that it is.

625
00:31:10,589 --> 00:31:12,490
I don't want it to change.

626
00:31:12,525 --> 00:31:15,093
I thought I liked it with you in it.

627
00:31:15,127 --> 00:31:16,895
I hope I'm not wrong.

628
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,467
Wait.

629
00:31:40,419 --> 00:31:42,387
I called your mother.

630
00:31:42,421 --> 00:31:43,621
What?

631
00:31:43,656 --> 00:31:45,356
Why? She kicked me out.

632
00:31:45,391 --> 00:31:48,026
She's on her way. She misses you.

633
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:50,128
- She's worried about you.
- Right.

634
00:31:50,162 --> 00:31:53,064
- I'm worried about you, too.
- Okay, if this is the part

635
00:31:53,098 --> 00:31:54,999
where you tell me that you talked to her

636
00:31:55,034 --> 00:31:58,503
and she convinced you that me
keeping my baby was a bad idea

637
00:31:58,537 --> 00:32:00,738
because I'm young and irresponsible...

638
00:32:00,773 --> 00:32:03,641
that's not what the
conversation was about.

639
00:32:03,676 --> 00:32:05,577
Okay, well... so you thought it over

640
00:32:05,611 --> 00:32:08,846
and you decided that you
don't have time for a kid?

641
00:32:08,881 --> 00:32:11,950
That's fine. I get it. You
have a life. You're busy.

642
00:32:11,984 --> 00:32:16,287
- But you know what? I can handle this kid on my own.
- No, you can't.

643
00:32:16,322 --> 00:32:18,489
Having a kid is hard.

644
00:32:18,524 --> 00:32:22,227
And you are young and irresponsible.

645
00:32:26,161 --> 00:32:30,397
But if that is your decision,
if that's what you want,

646
00:32:30,432 --> 00:32:33,200
then I'm in. I'm all in.

647
00:32:33,234 --> 00:32:37,204
I'm not too busy for my family.

648
00:32:37,238 --> 00:32:39,306
But...

649
00:32:42,978 --> 00:32:45,312
Don't keep the baby for me.

650
00:32:45,347 --> 00:32:47,748
You'll always have me.

651
00:32:47,782 --> 00:32:50,951
And I'll always want you.

652
00:32:50,986 --> 00:32:53,854
And that's true no matter what you decide.

653
00:32:59,828 --> 00:33:01,528
You're my kid.

654
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:04,865
And I'm so happy...

655
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:07,701
I get to know you, Sloan.

656
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:11,205
I'm so happy about that.

657
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,275
Hey.

658
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:17,244
- What are you doing right now?
- Uh...

659
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:19,813
- Can we walk and talk at the same time?
- Where are we going?

660
00:33:19,848 --> 00:33:21,815
You need to talk to
Derek Shepherd about Teddy

661
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:24,752
and why replacing her with
Evans would be a huge mistake.

662
00:33:24,786 --> 00:33:28,856
Remember, be persuasive and strong.

663
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:31,392
Use a lot of words. Cristina, I am not 12.

664
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,861
I'm not saying that you're 12...

665
00:33:33,895 --> 00:33:35,629
Dr. Yang, good work today.

666
00:33:35,663 --> 00:33:38,632
Uh, thank you, Dr. Evans.

667
00:33:38,666 --> 00:33:40,601
This is important.

668
00:33:45,926 --> 00:33:47,359
Shepherd.

669
00:33:47,394 --> 00:33:48,861
Hunt.

670
00:33:48,895 --> 00:33:51,864
Look, before you say anything,
I just want you to know

671
00:33:51,898 --> 00:33:54,867
that I think, uh... she's a fine surgeon.

672
00:33:54,901 --> 00:33:57,470
Uh-huh. Uh, Evans is interested?

673
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:59,038
Yeah, I think so.

674
00:33:59,072 --> 00:34:00,272
Well...

675
00:34:00,307 --> 00:34:02,241
Well, Evans is good. He's really good.

676
00:34:02,275 --> 00:34:04,777
And patients would
come here from all over.

677
00:34:04,811 --> 00:34:07,913
That would be... that would
be good for this hospital.

678
00:34:07,948 --> 00:34:10,216
Well, I'm glad you feel that way.

679
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:13,886
Yeah, and Teddy has
a lot of connections...

680
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:18,057
mainly on the east
coast, so she'd be fine.

681
00:34:18,091 --> 00:34:21,627
If that's what you decide...

682
00:34:21,661 --> 00:34:23,562
she'd be fine.

683
00:34:33,306 --> 00:34:35,107
Thank you.

684
00:34:44,044 --> 00:34:46,846
All right, Walter. I need
you to squeeze my hands.

685
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,582
All right. Let's do a
little push against them.

686
00:34:49,616 --> 00:34:51,884
Not bad, all things considered.

687
00:34:56,123 --> 00:34:57,990
You like being Captain?

688
00:34:58,024 --> 00:34:59,625
Do I like it?

689
00:35:01,294 --> 00:35:02,661
No.

690
00:35:02,696 --> 00:35:04,630
Me neither.

691
00:35:04,664 --> 00:35:07,166
You know what it beats, though?

692
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,802
It beats not being Captain.

693
00:35:09,836 --> 00:35:12,238
Mm-hmm.

694
00:35:14,274 --> 00:35:16,509
Come here, son.

695
00:35:27,496 --> 00:35:29,898
This was my fault.

696
00:35:29,932 --> 00:35:32,600
And I'm sorry.

697
00:35:39,208 --> 00:35:43,044
Thanks, dad.

698
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,214
Now just remember,

699
00:35:46,248 --> 00:35:49,184
the Sloans, we bloom early.

700
00:35:49,218 --> 00:35:54,422
So when you start to grow hair
on your face, don't be shy.

701
00:35:54,456 --> 00:35:56,558
Live it up.

702
00:35:56,592 --> 00:35:59,494
All the other guys will be jealous.

703
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:04,532
And it's okay to rub it in a little bit.

704
00:36:04,567 --> 00:36:06,034
But not a lot.

705
00:36:06,068 --> 00:36:09,838
You don't want to be
considered too full of yourself.

706
00:36:09,872 --> 00:36:12,974
No one likes a vain
guy in the locker room.

707
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:16,411
Mark.

708
00:36:19,415 --> 00:36:21,816
Oh, my God.

709
00:36:21,851 --> 00:36:24,752
Is that him?

710
00:36:29,859 --> 00:36:32,594
Hey there.

711
00:36:32,661 --> 00:36:34,662
Hi there, little guy.

712
00:36:34,697 --> 00:36:37,565
Oh.

713
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,768
He's so beautiful.

714
00:36:45,218 --> 00:36:47,453
This is, uh...

715
00:36:48,655 --> 00:36:51,357
And, uh, this...

716
00:36:51,391 --> 00:36:53,726
Thank you.

717
00:36:55,628 --> 00:36:58,197
Oh. Shh. Okay.

718
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,100
Look, baby.

719
00:37:01,134 --> 00:37:02,568
He has your dad's chin.

720
00:37:02,602 --> 00:37:04,636
What?

721
00:37:04,671 --> 00:37:06,905
That's crazy.

722
00:37:13,179 --> 00:37:15,547
Come in.

723
00:37:15,582 --> 00:37:17,383
Chief Shepherd...

724
00:37:17,417 --> 00:37:18,817
Are you busy?

725
00:37:18,852 --> 00:37:20,853
Did you just call me Chief Shepherd?

726
00:37:20,887 --> 00:37:22,855
I did.

727
00:37:22,889 --> 00:37:25,457
Go with it.

728
00:37:25,492 --> 00:37:27,926
What are you doing with the shades?

729
00:37:31,097 --> 00:37:33,432
- Shh. No one can know.
- No one can know what?

730
00:37:33,466 --> 00:37:36,368
About our secret love, Chief Shepherd.

731
00:37:36,403 --> 00:37:37,803
Our secret love?

732
00:37:37,837 --> 00:37:43,776
By the way, Chief, I picked
up your dry cleaning for you.

733
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:45,811
And I...

734
00:37:48,848 --> 00:37:51,216
had your car washed.

735
00:37:51,251 --> 00:37:54,686
And I dusted off your desk...

736
00:37:54,721 --> 00:37:56,889
- Uh-huh. -
with my bottom.

737
00:38:02,551 --> 00:38:05,420
Let me see if I can come
up with a list of things.

738
00:38:07,656 --> 00:38:09,123
Mm.

739
00:38:09,158 --> 00:38:12,126
Oh, Chief Shepherd.

740
00:38:20,436 --> 00:38:22,003
Give me a beer.

741
00:38:23,105 --> 00:38:25,373
You screwed me today. That was my patient.

742
00:38:25,407 --> 00:38:29,110
You made me look like a
moron. Get your own beer.

743
00:38:30,412 --> 00:38:33,481
You... you can't be an ass to me all day

744
00:38:33,515 --> 00:38:35,984
and then expect me to give you respect.

745
00:38:36,018 --> 00:38:37,886
You can't be an ass to me all day

746
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,888
and then expect me to give you sex.

747
00:38:39,922 --> 00:38:42,924
And you can stop with
the patronizing nicknames.

748
00:38:42,958 --> 00:38:45,860
I am a nice person who
couldn't even bring myself

749
00:38:45,895 --> 00:38:47,829
to attempt matricide by Sweet'N Low.

750
00:38:47,863 --> 00:38:50,198
That makes me charming to anybody else.

751
00:38:50,232 --> 00:38:53,835
I am a nice person and I am nice to you.

752
00:38:53,869 --> 00:38:57,205
So whatever your damage is, you
better start to be freaking nice to me,

753
00:38:57,239 --> 00:38:59,607
or I am not spreading
my legs for you anymore,

754
00:38:59,642 --> 00:39:01,643
no matter how much I may want to.

755
00:39:01,677 --> 00:39:04,078
Now give me a damn beer.

756
00:39:10,552 --> 00:39:12,287
As doctors...

757
00:39:12,321 --> 00:39:16,124
we have an arsenal of
weapons at the ready...

758
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,228
My cousin's baby punched her in the face.

759
00:39:37,998 --> 00:39:41,267
Literally.

760
00:39:41,301 --> 00:39:44,870
She had a black eye from a 1 year old.

761
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:52,111
Who needs it, right?

762
00:39:52,145 --> 00:39:54,914
I don't need that.

763
00:39:56,917 --> 00:39:58,984
They scream, they're grimy,

764
00:39:59,019 --> 00:40:03,923
they... smell like poop, and
the house smells like poop.

765
00:40:06,193 --> 00:40:07,760
Don't.

766
00:40:07,794 --> 00:40:09,161
Don't.

767
00:40:10,363 --> 00:40:12,964
Don't.

768
00:40:12,965 --> 00:40:15,900
Antibiotics to kill infections...

769
00:40:15,934 --> 00:40:18,703
Narcotics to fight pain...

770
00:40:23,275 --> 00:40:25,276
Tell me you're staying.

771
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:28,245
Please.

772
00:40:31,149 --> 00:40:32,850
I'm staying.

773
00:40:39,071 --> 00:40:41,440
Okay.

774
00:40:41,474 --> 00:40:43,337
Okay.

775
00:40:43,338 --> 00:40:46,589
Scalpels and retractors to
remove tumors and cancers...

776
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:47,991
Derek.

777
00:40:48,025 --> 00:40:50,260
To eradicate the threat...

778
00:40:50,327 --> 00:40:53,329
- I heard you gave Teddy a contract.
- Yes, I did.

779
00:40:53,364 --> 00:40:56,599
Well, I'm glad. It was the right move.

780
00:40:56,634 --> 00:40:59,102
Loyalty... it's a powerful thing.

781
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:01,070
It makes for a great Chief.

782
00:41:01,105 --> 00:41:03,873
I offered it to Evans.

783
00:41:03,908 --> 00:41:07,210
He passed.

784
00:41:07,244 --> 00:41:10,880
But just the physical threat.

785
00:41:10,915 --> 00:41:14,050
For every other kind...

786
00:41:14,084 --> 00:41:17,453
You're on your own.
