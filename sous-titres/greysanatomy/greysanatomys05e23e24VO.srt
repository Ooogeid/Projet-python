1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:07,990
when something begins,you generally
have no idea how it's going to end.

2
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:11,320
the house you were going
to sell   becomes your home.

3
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,090
the roommates you were forced
to take in   become your family.

4
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:22,240
and the one-night stand you were determined
to forget   becomes the love of your life.

5
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,210
how long have you been up?

6
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:28,820
all night.I was trying to figure out How
to get the tumor out of izzie's brain.

7
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,230
Why are you smiling?

8
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,050
'cause i figured out how to do it.

9
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,670
Once izzie's in the clear,we're gonna go to
the bahamas And have our wedding on the beach.

10
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,590
The one & only beach club-- You can
actually have drinks during the ceremony.

11
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,020
Are you sure you're
okay to be up and around?

12
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,110
Yes.i have good days and bad days.

13
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:54,700
Plus,i don't want to spend our
entire honeymoon In a hospital bed.

14
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,250
- This is not our honeymoon.
- It totally is.

15
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,160
Come on.i want you to meet my friends.

16
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,390
I know all your friends.

17
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,060
You know all my doctor
friends.i'm a patient now.

18
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,930
You're gonna meet my patient friends,and
they're gonna love my new husband.

19
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,830
- Don't make a big deal.
- i'm not gonna make a big deal.

20
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,470
i'm a bride.

21
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,620
Iz,come on.i'm getting her a real one.

22
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,380
i love this one,And
that makes it a real one.

23
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,360
Okay,everybody,this is alex,my husband.

24
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:28,440
Husband,this is
austin,star,meg,miguel and alison.

25
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,150
Can you turn him around
so we can see the butt?

26
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,020
Yes.alex?

27
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,690
- What,are you kidding me?
- No.

28
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,120
oh,a big trauma just came in.that's...

29
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,440
- That's quality booty.
- right?

30
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,340
- Congratulations,izzie.
- thank you.

31
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:52,260
So,uh... I had a good session
with my shrink this morning.

32
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,410
Did you talk to her about your mom?

33
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,880
I mean,have you seen your mom yet?

34
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,980
'cause she lives,like,you know,a few miles
away,And she thinks you're still in iraq.

35
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,660
yeah,i--i'm
planning to see her.

36
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,250
When?

37
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,120
Dr. hunt... i'm not on trauma today?

38
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,850
Follow me,o'malley.

39
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,670
Lieutenant lowell,i'm Dr.
hunt.We spoke on the phone.

40
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,420
major hunt,it's good to finally meet
you.My c.o. has told me a lot about you.

41
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,300
Ah,you shouldn't believe
anything steve mason tells you.

42
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,820
This is Dr. o'malley,and
you've already met Dr. torres.

43
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:34,170
I'm looking at charlie's post-op scans,but i'm not
finding Anything functionally wrong with the leg.

44
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:38,790
except that i can't walk or run or
move really Without serious pain.

45
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:42,690
I've tried everything--
medications,physical therapy.Nothing works.

46
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,510
- Which could indicate nerve damage.
- Or a chronic pain syndrome.

47
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:51,770
and we can definitely look into Pain management procedures,But
surgically,i'm afraid,uh,there's nothing i can do.

48
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:55,390
Actually,there is.

49
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,510
You could cut it off.

50
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:03,200
You can cut it off And replace it with a prosthetic
leg So i can get back to iraq where i'm needed.

54
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,390
did you know that's why he was here?

55
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,220
No,but is it such an
unreasonable request?

56
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,450
Unreasonable?

57
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,130
cutting off a viable
limb is dismemberment.

58
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,460
That kid made lieutenant at 19.

59
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,780
He was planning on spending the
rest of his life In the military.

60
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,260
they gonna take him back with one leg?

61
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,090
There have been several lower-leg amputees
Who've returned to active duty with prosthetics.

62
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,370
voluntary amputees?

63
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,310
Maybe.i don't know.

64
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,560
Are you saying i have
to turn this kid away?

65
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,820
His c.o. sent him here
because he trusts me.

66
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,950
We could get another set of scans
And then try an epidural for the pain.

67
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,380
Dr. torres?

68
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,210
Fine.do an m.r.i. and an epidural.

69
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:53,720
I'll take a look at the scans,But if the
leg is healthy,i'm not cutting it off.

70
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,020
Dr. bailey,are you busy today?

71
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:06,460
that depends.You got any more dying children you want
me to become Overly attached to before they expire?

72
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,630
No.i have an 8-year-old neuroblastoma
patient,And he's gonna live.

73
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:11,050
i can feel it in my bones.

74
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,910
So scrub in with me and see the joy.

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,810
um,Dr. bailey.

76
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,070
May i borrow you?

77
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,110
Who is santa claus?

78
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,330
An old white man who lives at the north pole
And enters people's homes inappropriately.

79
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,160
No.

80
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,550
i'm santa claus.

81
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,430
all systems ready.

82
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,860
Oh,no,you did not!

83
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,910
Oh,yes,i did.

84
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:42,600
The da vinci s.i. h.d. surgical system.

85
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:48,380
Tell me you didn't wait Till i had all but left
the general surgery program To buy us a da vinci!

86
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,120
Care to take it out for a spin?

87
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,930
Santa.

88
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,070
Hey,i was thinking,you know,With,uh,derek
and meredith getting married,

89
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:03,190
they,uh,Probably don't want us
hanging out in the attic much longer.

90
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,920
So i was thinking i'd
start looking for a condo.

91
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,730
Perfect,And then you'd finally
have a place of your own.

92
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:15,100
Actually,i was,you know,thinking
maybe you'd,uh,You'd come with me.

93
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,540
absolutely.no,i-i-- i
would love to see it.

94
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,040
I'm so happy for you.

95
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,400
How much of that did you hear?

96
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:30,270
You mean the part where you asked her to move
in with you,Or the part where she shot you down?

97
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,520
I was here for both.

98
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,450
By the way,it's just way too early
For you to be moving in with lexie.

99
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:37,910
you don't have to do everything i do.

100
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,500
this is not about you.

101
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,380
I have my own future to
think about.life is short.

102
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,530
Look at what's going on with stevens.

103
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,090
don't worry about stevens.i got a plan.

104
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,870
You want to remove her hippocampus?

105
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,490
One of them.it's a common
procedure for seizure patients.

106
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:54,690
Removing her hippocampus Could
compromise her memory,her speech.

107
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,720
She wouldn't be able to
practice medicine anymore.

108
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,590
i have performed this
surgery hundreds of times.

109
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,250
On cancer
patients?no,but it's--

110
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,300
If you do the surgery,i
could lose my memory?

111
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,120
It's unlikely,but it's possible.

112
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,930
and if you don't do the surgery?

113
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,100
we could shrink the tumor with i.l.-2.

114
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,530
if the tumor doesn't kill me first.

115
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,180
- Why take the chance?
- have you even done a wada test To see how her memory would be affected?

116
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:19,060
putting her brain to sleep and asking her to remember A bunch of
flash cards is not an accurate assessment Of the post-surgical outcome.

117
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,100
but it would tell us whether or not She could function
afterwards,And as Dr. stevens' primary physician--

118
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,110
fine,i'll do
it.it's unnecessary--

119
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,680
The surgery is unnecessary.

120
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:29,300
the tumor's already symptomatic.she's
having hallucinations.

121
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,320
That's a nice ring.

122
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:45,840
Alex outdid himself.

123
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:49,030
We're gonna have beautiful
kids,Don't you think?

124
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,060
Is four too many?

125
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,510
Four is perfect.

126
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:58,840
Ideally,it would be two boys and two girls--
One of which would definitely be a tomboy.

127
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:02,500
And i was thinking I should have them pretty
close together,Though that might be stupid.

128
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,150
Why wait?

129
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,160
exactly.

130
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,190
That way,If i'm not able to
practice medicine anymore...

131
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,370
You won't want to.

132
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,180
You don't think?

133
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,810
- Do you?
- I'm asking you.

134
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,490
Why do you keep agreeing
with everything i say?

135
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,930
Because i am you.

136
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:24,620
i'm your tumor.You're...
talking to yourself.

137
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,260
Right.

138
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:30,630
At least until you have
surgery,if you have surgery.

139
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,480
Are you gonna have surgery?

140
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:52,810
If derek cuts the tumor out,i could lose
my memory,And if he doesn't,i could die.

141
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:56,120
I don't know what to
do.alex,tell me what to do.

142
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,210
Iz,i can't tell you what to do.

143
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,940
of course you can.You're my husband.

144
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:03,010
that's what husbands do.They stomp
around telling their wives what to do.

145
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,340
It's your job.

146
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,460
no,my job is to support
whatever you want to do.

147
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,790
I don't know what i want to do.

148
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:11,510
That's why i'm asking you.

149
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,850
Okay,i have an idea.

150
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,960
Let's put it to a vote.

151
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:20,210
- all in favor of the surgery... - No,we're
not voting.no one's--no one's voting.

152
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,750
Opposed?

153
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:25,180
I'm opposed...  To voting.

154
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,880
Just decide for me.please.

155
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,810
You don't have to know right now.

156
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:31,890
think about it.

157
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:34,790
I don't have time.

158
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,590
Captain mason told me that you saved his
life At least four times in the field.

159
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,740
yeah,and a couple of times in the
canteen,But don't tell mason i told you that.

160
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,070
So... you think i'll get to go back?

161
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:50,990
Are you sure you want to?

162
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,440
I mean,why do you want to cut off
your leg Just to go back to the war?

163
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,130
Don't you have family?

164
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,840
You know what it's like to have family who don't
know you,Who don't get you,maybe even don't like you?

165
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,830
Yeah,actually,uh,i have brothers.

166
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,010
Me,too.

167
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:14,450
So there's that family,The guys i grew
up with,And we've got nothing in common,

168
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,790
And then there's
my guys in iraq--

169
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:25,160
My real family Whatever we got
into,we were in it together.

170
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:29,480
But here,i'm alone.i'm nobody.

171
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:32,050
And i've tried.You know,i've
tried fitting in here.

172
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,890
I've tried being a regular person.

173
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,770
I've tried getting a
job,but there aren't any.

174
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:44,830
There are a lot of things that i wanted to be in my life,A
lot of things i wanted to do,But none of them's here.

175
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:52,570
This is alison clark.she was
referred to me two years ago.

176
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,140
Mets in her brain,liver,kidney?

177
00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:01,150
she ended up having five surgeries And
extensive chemo,which worked,But then...

178
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,910
Oh,yeah,the mets came back.

179
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:09,470
That's when i started
her i.l.-2 therapy.

180
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,180
And now... After three
treatments in as many months...

181
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,540
The mets are gone?

182
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,130
The mets are gone.

183
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,400
Dr. stevens should be patient.

184
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,210
She should give her therapies a chance.

185
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:32,840
As surgeons,we like to cut,But...
Sometimes there's a better way.

186
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,080
Let me retract that small bowel So
you'll have better visualization.

187
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:46,300
You know what,chief?Thanks
to leo,you don't have to.

188
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:49,740
- leo?
- Leonardo...  da vinci.

189
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,260
Here,here,watch this.

190
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,970
See?

191
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,470
540 degrees of wristed movement.

192
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,210
Can't do that with a laparoscope.

193
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:04,770
Or in open surgery.Feels
pretty good,doesn't it?

194
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,240
Dr. bailey,Are you
making lightsaber noises?

195
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,870
Uh,not anymore,sir.

196
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:26,950
You know,Dr. chalikonda at cleveland clinic Is doing
single-incision gall bladder removal Through the belly button.

197
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:29,560
We could try that on the next one...

198
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,160
If you're up to it.

199
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,950
- Don't tease me,sir.
- Oh,i'm not.

200
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,730
Why should Dr. chalikonda
have all the fun?

201
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:51,080
It's impressive,but it took
two years to get these results.

202
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:53,520
Yeah,but these two scans
were taken three months apart.

203
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,090
But izzie may not have three months.

204
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:59,100
That tumor could start bleeding
in three days or three seconds.

205
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,180
And since when are
you not about cutting?

206
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,140
Since it may not be in the
best interest of our patient.

207
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:06,740
And derek's not acting
in izzie's best interest?

208
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,210
They're ready for us in radiology.

209
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:32,290
- Okay,iz,I am going to show you a series-- A
series of images that you want me to try to remember

210
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:35,560
Once derek puts the right
side of my brain to sleep.

211
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,560
Hit me.show me what you got.

212
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,840
okay.Is that a schnauzer or a scottie?

213
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,490
How specific do i need to be?

214
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,880
dog's fine.

215
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:49,120
It's either a 727 or a 747.

216
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,380
Plane.

217
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:54,390
Ooh,a 2-story victorian mansion.

218
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:59,090
- We would also accept the word "house."
-  Schnauzer,747,mansion.

219
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:01,310
schnauzer,747,mansion.

220
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:03,550
Or dog,plane,house.

221
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:06,800
I'm gonna put the right hemisphere
of your brain To sleep now,okay?

222
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:14,110
Dog,plane,house. dog,plane,house. ...

223
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,650
Okay,now we just wait for the
brain activity In that area to stop.

224
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:27,970
Dog,plane,house.dog,plane... H...

225
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,550
Okay,iz.

226
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:42,630
can you tell me what you saw?

227
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,770
Show her the cards.

228
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,320
Um... what's this?

229
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:58,390
Dog.Can you say dog?

230
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,850
What's my name?

231
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:08,150
just stick to the cards,meredith.

232
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,840
M... Meredith.

233
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,280
You know my name.you can say my name.

234
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:21,490
- M...
- This is what i was afraid of.

235
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:24,940
Okay,who's alex?

236
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,430
Iz,okay,you don't have to speak.

237
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:32,810
Just nod your head for me if
you know who alex karev is.

238
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:48,600
The test impaired your memory to such a degree that I
have to strongly recommend you don't have the surgery.

239
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,620
Izzie,the test was the
worst-case scenario.

240
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,200
- The result has nothing to do with the surgery.
- we don't know that.

241
00:14:53,320 --> 00:15:00,780
What i do know is that not operating Is every bit as
risky as the surgery itself,If not more,but it's up to you.

242
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,170
What do you think?

243
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,550
I think he's talking to you,not me.

244
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,720
I'll leave you two
alone to discuss this.

245
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,560
Uh,i'll come with you.i
have a couple of questions.

246
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:14,030
- wait,alex.
- Just think about what you want to do for a second,okay?

247
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,090
I'll be right back.

248
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:28,490
You are not having this surgery.

249
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,880
I need you to not talk
medicine to me,okay?

250
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:39,130
Talk to me like i'm your friend,Like i'm the guy whose
cereal you eat in the morning,And tell me what to do.

251
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:41,970
karev-- Please.karev,i
can't tell you what to do.

252
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,280
What if it was meredith?

253
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:52,660
What would you do if you had to choose Between spending a
few more months with meredith Knowing she was gonna die--

254
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:55,230
Watching her
hurt,watching her sick--

255
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:01,550
Or spending the rest of your life With someone
who looked like meredith But wasn't her anymore?

256
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:06,610
She's the one good thing that ever
happened to me,The one good thing.

257
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,710
So i need to know what to do.

258
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:12,740
I need you to tell me--
what if it was meredith?

259
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:17,850
I would ask her to have the surgery.

260
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,650
you couldn't remember anything.

261
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:25,450
You didn't know my name.

262
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,400
You didn't know who derek was.

263
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,560
you didn't know who alex was.

264
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,050
You couldn't even remember how to speak.

265
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:32,710
How come i don't remember any of this?

266
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:37,140
Because the tumor is sitting right in the
middle Of everything that makes you you.

267
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:44,370
I was standing there talking to you Exactly
like i am now,Only you weren't there.

268
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:46,690
You weren't you.

269
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,140
you were gone.

270
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,480
So what do i do?

271
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:56,910
Well,swender has a patient-- Female,22
years old,metastatic melanoma.

272
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:02,330
- Alison clark?- after three months of the
i.l.-2,Her mets were gone-- all of them.

273
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,040
You're not having this surgery.

274
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:10,760
Don't do it.

275
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,200
that's my vote.Don't have the surgery.

276
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,770
I didn't.i freakin' hate surgery.

277
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm hallucinating,alison.

278
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:26,760
I have really long conversations With
dead people And i see things that aren't...

279
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:33,280
Like right now,for example,I'm pretty certain
there aren't birds flying over your head

280
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:38,320
Because this is a hospital and that
would be weird,But that's what i'm seeing.

281
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,440
I have a brain tumor.Am i really
not gonna let them cut it out?

282
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,990
I didn't let them cut out mine.

283
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:54,060
It's like... Okay,one minute,i'm this college kid,Rowing
crew and being an idiot And forgetting my sunscreen

284
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:59,490
and thinking it doesn't matter Because i'm
me,And life has worked out pretty well for me.

285
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:04,610
And then the next minute,They're
cutting into my body every other week.

286
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,490
I had 15 surgeries.

287
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:12,370
And then i said,enough.

288
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,120
Forget it.

289
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:17,450
I'll row crew in heaven or whatever.

290
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,710
And then the i.l.-2 worked.

291
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,110
It worked.

292
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,330
I come here every three
weeks,I get my medicine,And...

293
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:31,800
i don't have a brain tumor anymore.

294
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:41,730
Look,charlie,if we admit you,If we do what
you're asking us to do,The pain in your leg...

295
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,810
There's no way of knowing
if amputation will cure it.

296
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:45,780
- but it might.
- Yes,it might.

297
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,470
and once i get the
prosthetic,then--

298
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:51,210
Uh,it will be months before i can even
begin Fitting you with a prosthetic,

299
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,230
Which won't feel anything
like a new leg,by the way.

300
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:57,030
It will feel like 5 pounds of
metal that hurts and pinches.

301
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,530
And what if the army says no?

302
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,500
- no,no-- What if they
don't take you back?

303
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:03,360
- they will.chances are that-- You
really want to take that chance,charlie?

304
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,930
You're asking me to
remove one of your limbs.

305
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,360
yeah,you think i don't know that?You
think i want to cut my leg off?

306
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:10,060
of course not.

307
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,490
Am i sure about this?no.

308
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,970
The only thing i'm sure about
is that i am in hell right now.

309
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:16,920
that i am sure of.

310
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,530
i've lost everything--  Everything i've
worked for,everything that i care about--

311
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:24,100
And i've traded it in for A 6-times-a-day
pain-pill habit that doesn't even work.

312
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:29,440
So don't waste both our times by trying to
scare me,Because you do not scare me,Dr. torres.

313
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:34,920
After everything i've been
through,Nothing scares me.

314
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:39,430
So are we gonna do this or not?

315
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:50,480
Dr. robbins,Dr. bailey just performed seattle
grace's First single-incision gall bladder removal..

316
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,360
that's cool.

317
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,000
- Through the patient's belly button.
- and now it's kinda creepy.

318
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,850
No,no.you shoulda seen it.

319
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:01,290
No scars,no bleeding,and about half the
time It would've taken laparoscopically.

320
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,970
You want to do one after
lunch?i've got another coli.

321
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,300
y-you don't mind?

322
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:09,010
Oh,well,also,I guess i'm on
my own for this afternoon.

323
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,820
My neuroblastoma?

324
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:13,260
No,no,no,no.don't
worry.you don't have to.

325
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,800
You'll have the rest of your
life to do neuroblastomas.

326
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:18,870
Well,then i'll see you after lunch,sir.

327
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:22,690
okay. Chief.

328
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:25,350
Yes,Dr. robbins.

329
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:31,490
- Chief...
- Did you want to tell me something?

330
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:38,590
I am going to cry,and i just want you to know That i know
that it's going to happen,and i just want you to ignore it.

331
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,920
And i'm not crying because i'm upset.

332
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:44,170
It's just what happens when i
get mad At people of authority.

333
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,240
you're mad at me?

334
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,080
i am mad at you.

335
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,890
And i'm crying because you're the boss,my
boss,Which brings up my issues of authority

336
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:54,200
and my dad,Who you kind of remind me of.

337
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,540
Not that you're old,but
you command respect.

338
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:00,730
People respect you.i mean,i know i do,And
i know bailey does,which is why i'm mad.

339
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,920
Because it's wrong,sir.

340
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:08,150
it's wrong and mean to use a robot To lure Dr. bailey
back into general surgery 'cause i don't have a robot.

341
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:12,320
All i have are little kids,And...
they're not as fun as a robot.

342
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:17,760
And they're not shiny and--and new and silver And they
don't have things Coming out of their belly buttons,But...

343
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:23,890
i will fight you,and i will win... sir.

344
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:27,270
You think you can fight me and win?

345
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:30,200
Yes.

346
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:33,420
Good luck.

347
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:38,230
Because i have something that
you don't have.I have joy... Sir.

348
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,060
What's going on?

349
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,330
Oh,we're just going
over,uh,izzie's i.l.-2 schedule.

350
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,740
Oh,for after the surgery?

351
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,680
I decided not to have the surgery.

352
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,930
What?

353
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,980
- Uh,maybe we should come back...
- Yeah.

354
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,480
- Dr. yang.
- Sure.

355
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:14,680
- You're having the surgery.
- what?

356
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,380
Shepherd said this is your last shot.

357
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,810
- but i dec-- Look,i am your husband,And
i say that you are having the surgery.

358
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,950
what happened to,"this
is your decision"?

359
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,740
That was when i thought you
were gonna make the right one.

360
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:30,050
But you chose wrong,So now you don't get to make
this decision on your own,Because you married me.

361
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,260
It's not just your
life at stake anymore.

362
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,470
It's my life,too,my life with you.

363
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:42,190
So you can tell swender whatever you want,But i'm telling
shepherd and i'm telling you,You're having the surgery.

364
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,950
She may be your friend,But that doesn't
give you the right to go in and--

365
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,860
And talk her out of a surgery
you know nothing about.

366
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:00,700
You're not her doctor.

367
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,050
you're swender's resident.What you
did is not only inappropriate...

368
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,350
- derek-- It is
unprofessional.

369
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,840
you crossed the line,cristina.

370
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,560
no,she didn't.i did.

371
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,030
I'm the one who convinced
izzie not to have the surgery.

372
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,830
I'm the one you should
be yelling at right now.

373
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:19,830
Well,i'm gonna go now.

374
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:23,990
Unless you want to
apologize to-- Okay.

375
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:32,090
My mother disappeared
right in front of me.

376
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:36,080
Everything she had,everything
she was-- Her dignity,her memory.

377
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,150
In the end,she wasn't
even my mother anymore.

378
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,880
Izzie is not your mother.

379
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:41,730
She doesn't have an
untreatable brain condition.

380
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:45,000
She has a tumor,and it can be treated.

381
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,320
- Don't make this personal,meredith.
- i wasn't.

382
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:50,370
You went to izzie as her friend
And you made up her mind for her.

383
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:55,640
So now as my resident,you go back there and
change it,Because this tumor will kill her.

384
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:03,080
Quick consult,Dr. yang.

385
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,970
What are you doing?

386
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:13,780
I've realized,The reason i haven't told my mother
i'm back Is because part of me is still over there.

387
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,450
I made a commitment to the army
that i wasn't able to fulfill.

388
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,630
If my unit hadn't been
destroyed,I would still be there.

389
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:22,830
So no wonder i can't sleep at night
Or--or look my mother in the eye.

390
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:24,570
No wonder you and i--
we can't move forward.

391
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,600
My work there isn't done.

392
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:30,070
Until it is,i have no
business being here.

393
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:36,190
So... i've decided to go back.

394
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:40,420
I have to go.

395
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:43,890
- Cristina,come on.i'm sorry..
- what.what am i supposed to say?

396
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:46,910
I could use your support.

397
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,810
You don't have it.

398
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:58,110
Dr. torres.

399
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,620
Dr. o'malley.

400
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:04,380
- I just wanted to apologize for...
- It's okay,charlie.

401
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:07,040
- You don't have to do that.
- no,i do,

402
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:11,480
'cause you were both just trying to do your job in
there,And your job is to put people back together,

403
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:14,670
Not take them apart,and i get that.

404
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:20,370
And i know it doesn't make sense to you That i would want
to go back to a place Where people get hurt and die,but...

405
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:25,910
We're there because we're trying to
help people,Save people,same as you.

406
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:29,130
It's my job,who i am,it's...

407
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:34,940
If something happened,And suddenly
you couldn't be a doctor anymore,

408
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:41,230
If someone told you you couldn't do it anymore,Wouldn't you
want to do everything you could possibly do To be a doctor again?

409
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:51,580
we haven't even been married 24 hours
yet,And we've already had our first fight.

410
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:53,340
That's a good sign.

411
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:56,390
Fighting leads to good makeup sex.

412
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:01,420
Are you watching birds
fly around my head again?

413
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,800
Am i,like,totally snow white right now?

414
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:07,690
I just don't want to hurt him.

415
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:09,590
He'll come around.

416
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:16,000
It might take a while,but once that tumor disappears,Once
you're back at work,cutting open other people,

417
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,430
He'll come around.

418
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,330
Is it hummingbirds at least?

419
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:27,830
I really like hummingbirds.

420
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,390
we need to go talk to izzie.

421
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:38,990
No,we are not talking izzie into having surgery
Because your future husband is mad at you.

422
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:42,660
But he has a right to be mad Because we didn't
talk izzie out of the surgery As her doctors,

423
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,600
we did it as her friends.

424
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:50,100
No,our job as doctors is to present the options,Answer
questions And let the patient decide their course of treatment.

425
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:51,710
That is what we did.

426
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,660
right.Except i may have
presented her options as

427
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,670
,"you're having the
surgery over my dead body.

428
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:03,760
" He has a right to be mad.

429
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,150
- Oh,crap.
- Who is it?

430
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:11,160
- Izzie?what the--
what happened?

431
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,710
I don't know.where's swender?

432
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:15,120
- Izzie,let me take over.
- izzie,come sit down.

433
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,640
The vessels and nerves are separated.

434
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,360
Skin flap is done.

435
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,950
Remind me again why i'm doing this.

436
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,430
Someone please remind me again.

437
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:44,330
You don't know what's gonna happen to this kid,How
many fights he could win,how many lives he could save.

438
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,820
If you don't do this,He's
never gonna get the chance.

439
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,980
We're not doing harm.

440
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:55,420
we're not hurting him.We are saving him.

441
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,750
We're doing what he wants.

442
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,740
It's what he wants.

443
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:27,540
B.p.'s still dropping.

444
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:29,750
We need more blood.we
need to move faster.

445
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,990
Okay,i'm done.i'm at the end.

446
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,830
I didn't see any bowel perforation.

447
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:34,770
It's there somewhere.run it again.

448
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,440
- Dr. swender--
Run it again.

449
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,890
Yes,ma'am.

450
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:44,040
So much for i.l.-2.

451
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:48,150
You think this is my fault?

452
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,860
You think i did this to her?

453
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,420
- No,ma'am.
- There is no cure for cancer,Dr. yang.

454
00:28:55,460 --> 00:29:00,840
There's only us,the two of us,right here,right
now,Fighting this thing as aggressively as we know how.

455
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:04,800
And sometimes that means Pumping toxins
into the patient to kill the cancer,

456
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:10,280
And yes,sometimes,not very often,but
sometimes,Those toxins kill the patient as well.

457
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:17,710
But alison had three months to live When she first came to
see me,And i have managed to keep her alive for two years.

458
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:24,720
So i am not about to give up on her Or the
i.l.-2 anytime soon,And neither are you.

459
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:36,270
I wasn't asking you
to come see the condo.

460
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:42,730
I was asking you to move in with
me... If that's what you want.

461
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,710
- I do.
- You do?

462
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,120
Yeah.

463
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,090
- not right away.
- No,of course not.

464
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,320
- in,like,a year.
- ten years.

465
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:53,860
I'm sorry,what now?

466
00:29:53,890 --> 00:30:00,110
oh,um,well,because i'll-- I'll still be a resident for,like,six
more years,And--and then i'd want to get my practice up and running.

467
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,950
So... how about seven?

468
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,910
- How about five years?
- i'll still be a resident.

469
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:07,610
So?stevens and karev are residents.

470
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:14,510
Meredith's a resident,bailey's a resident-- All
married or soon to be,And happily... or whatever.

471
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:20,390
I'm sorry.are you asking
me... to--to-- to marry you?

472
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:24,340
no.  Why?would you?

473
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,750
Um,should we be having
this conversation?

474
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,410
- no,probably not.-
No,i-i--that's... okay.

475
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,240
Impressive work today,Dr. bailey.

476
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:33,990
thank you,sir.it was fun.

477
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:37,370
Yeah,it was,wasn't it?

478
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:46,390
Sounds like you guys had a good day.

479
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,610
how did the,uh,neuroblastoma kid do?

480
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:53,410
Oh,he was awesome.the surgery was totally
easy,And he's gonna make a full recovery.

481
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:55,180
- good.
- That's kind of why i wanted you there.

482
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:59,120
'cause the kids you can save Almost
make up for the ones you can't.

483
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,670
Anyways,i'm gonna go
monitor him post-op.

484
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,580
And then i'm gonna tell
his family the good news.

485
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,220
You should stop by,come see the joy.

486
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,760
okay.

487
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:38,750
we had to resect part of her bowel.

488
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:44,010
Unfortunately,we weren't able to finish
the surgery Because she was too unstable.

489
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:49,390
Right now she's on a ventilator
Because she can't breathe on her own.

490
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:54,630
But,uh,you're gonna be able
to finish the surgery,right?

491
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,830
Yes,if she stabilizes.

492
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:02,850
And then she'll be able to
breathe on her own again?

493
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,200
Your daughter's heart
stopped during surgery,

494
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:15,260
Which means her brain
wasn't getting oxygen.

495
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:21,480
So it's unlikely She'll be
able to come off the ventilator.

496
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,690
oh,god.oh,no.

497
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:08,720
izzie.izzie.Izzie.

498
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,050
You paged me.are you okay?

499
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:14,820
No.i don't know what to do.

500
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,220
I don't know if i
should have the surgery.

501
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:21,210
I think i'm gonna die either
way.You gotta tell me what to do.

502
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:26,890
- you know what to do.
-No,i don't.I don't.

503
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:29,480
Yes,you do.

504
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,550
You're just scared to do it.

505
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:34,360
This back and forth is just fear.

506
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:38,260
But you've already made the decision.

507
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:44,260
You already made it.You made it the
second you decided to fight this thing.

508
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:50,220
Just look... where you started.

509
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,340
Look where you are now.

510
00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:02,020
I mean,now you're this...
Incredible surgeon... And teacher.

511
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,570
You're a doer,remember?

512
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:18,050
You know exactly what you have to do.

513
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,540
Come in.

514
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,710
You can do it.

515
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,820
You can cut into my brain again.

516
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,540
Okay.

517
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:48,520
You can do it,but... I don't
want to end up a vegetable.

518
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:51,560
- Izzie,you won't.
- no,just listen.

519
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:58,950
I want the surgery,right now,But if something
goes wrong,I don't want to end up on a ventilator.

520
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:03,280
So i'm signing a d.n.r.

521
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:12,720
Please.

522
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,910
- alex-- Look,you
went crazy.

523
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,450
When denny signed that
d.n.r.,you went crazy.

524
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:17,940
Is that what you want?you
want me cutting l-vads?

525
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,500
- No,i-- you want
to wreck my career?

526
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:22,120
'cause i will.I will freakin'
cut l-vads before i let you--

527
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:24,940
Just st--just
wait,stop.

528
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:27,180
You don't get to quit.

529
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:29,530
you don't get to quit on me.

530
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:32,620
Please... tear it up.

531
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,150
The d.n.r.--tear
it up.

532
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:44,200
Where your eyes are supposed to be
right now,I see white sandy beaches...

533
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:50,120
And there's an ocean behind your head,And
there are ghosts wandering in and out.

534
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,890
I can't live like this.

535
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:56,700
And i can't live...

536
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:04,780
If something goes wrong in that surgery,I don't want
any extraordinary measures taken To keep me alive.

537
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:08,340
It's not what i want.

538
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:12,930
I went crazy when denny signed the
d.n.r. Because i didn't understand.

539
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:14,990
I didn't understand,but now i do.

540
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:19,320
And i need you to understand.

541
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:23,410
I don't want you to go crazy.I
want you to have a brilliant career,

542
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:29,290
And i hope that i get to be here for that,But
if i can't,i just want to go to the other side.

543
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:36,420
I don't know what's there,but it's gotta be better
Than hospital beds and tubes down my throat,So please...

544
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:40,060
Please don't cut l-vads.

545
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:46,580
Just... If it comes down to it,

546
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:49,230
Just let me go.

547
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:01,350
And right now,kiss me.

548
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:06,420
Please,please just kiss me,and close your
eyes,Because the beach is so distracting.

549
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:33,050
I always thought it would be me.

550
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:38,010
I'd get alzheimer's like my
mother And forget everyone.

551
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,870
Let's go to city hall tomorrow.

552
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:51,360
I don't want to spend another
day Not being married to you.

553
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,500
Okay.

554
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:21,250
It doesn't matter how good
you are Or how hard you work.

555
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:26,530
You can do all the research,You can
master all the latest techniques,

556
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:30,940
Um,you can be the best,You can be
the best surgeon in the world...

557
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:35,620
But your patients are still gonna die.

558
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:40,030
'cause the next day or the next...

559
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,540
month Or next year,you
know,they're just gonna...

560
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:49,010
get hit by a car *****

561
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,400
And there's nothing you can do about it.

562
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:01,120
I don't want you to die.

563
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:17,790
You okay?

564
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,450
I cut off a healthy leg.

565
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,980
I just cut it off.

566
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:28,800
It was for the patient's own
good,But still,i feel like a butcher.

567
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:32,130
My miracle case is on life support.

568
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:37,370
I thought i had one... One miracle.

569
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:43,620
I hate this job sometimes.

570
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:46,590
I don't know why we do this.

571
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,170
Come on.

572
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:52,780
come with me.

573
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:02,050
Okay,what are we doing here?

574
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:04,910
We came to see that.

575
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:06,960
What?

576
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:09,640
The joy.

577
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:16,130
It comes around rarely,So
rarely we forget it can happen.

578
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:22,490
But that... That's why
we do this-- The joy.

579
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:38,830
we spend our whole lives
worrying about the future...

580
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:46,090
planning for the future,trying
to predict the future...

581
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,720
Will you come with me?

582
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,180
as if figuring it out will
somehow cushion the blow.

583
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:02,920
but the future is always changing.

584
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,880
Got one more.He's a doctor.

585
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:08,240
he says he needs to do it today.

586
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,720
Come in.

587
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:18,890
the future is the home
of our deepest fears...

588
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:25,420
Owen?

589
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,700
Hi,mom.

590
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,220
I'm home.

591
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:38,020
and our wildest hopes.

592
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,850
but one thing is certain...

593
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:52,220
when it finally reveals itself...

594
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:54,430
Congratulations,doctor.

595
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,010
Welcome to the army.

596
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:58,490
- the future...
- Thank you.

597
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:01,660
is never the way we imagined it.

601
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:22,600
doctors spend a lot of time
focused on the future...

602
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:27,250
planning it...   working toward it.

603
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:35,440
but at some point,you start to realize,

604
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,630
your life is happening now...

605
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:40,760
-Any changes overnight?
-No.

606
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:46,400
not after med school,not
after residency,right now.

607
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,060
this is it.it's here.

608
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:52,480
blink and you'll miss it.

609
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:54,430
Oh,it's the chief.

610
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:59,180
somebody better make a coffee
run.You all look like hell.

611
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,680
i gotta be in surgery in ten minutes.

612
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,690
Um,mer,will you let me know?

613
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:08,430
We should go,too.it's
probably gonna be a while.

614
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:10,390
Shepherd said she'd
wake up in the morning.

615
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:14,690
What did he tell you?was
that all crap?What did he say?

616
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:18,790
He said it may be a while.

617
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:25,900
She's gonna wake up.

618
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:51,190
(speaking inaudibly)
Stevens still isn't awake.

619
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:53,580
And i'm having something of
a day even aside from that.

620
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:56,450
So... don't take my face personally.

621
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:58,450
It's just my face today.

622
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:00,030
did you tell her?

623
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:03,470
Uh,you should tell her,And
don't take her face personally.

624
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:07,570
okay,well... On behalf of the
department of pediatric surgery,

625
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:10,430
I'd like to welcome you to the
fellowship program.You're in!

626
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:12,160
we're gonna get you a
pair of wheelie sneaks.

627
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,060
congratulations.

628
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:20,290
All right.

629
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:23,570
I know i didn't support
you during this process.

630
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:28,100
In any event,i am behind you now.

631
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:34,510
I'm trying to be a big person
here.How about you meet me halfway?

632
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:44,280
wake up.wake up.Wake
up.wake up. Wake up. wake up.

633
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:48,610
I have a headache.

634
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:52,360
you're up?

635
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:55,350
You're up and you're talking.

636
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:57,190
You talked,right?

637
00:44:57,830 --> 00:44:58,970
Talk!

638
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:02,160
i said i have a headache. stop yelling.

639
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:03,310
Page shepherd!

640
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,510
i'm sorry.

641
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:13,070
Hey,what's with hugging o'malley?

642
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,420
I slept,cristina.

643
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,590
Last night,i slept for
the first time in...

644
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:19,400
i slept.

645
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,700
And,uh,i don't know,Hugging
o'malley because you slept?

646
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:26,670
No,i hugged o'malley 'cause he's got
great news,Which i'll let him tell you,

647
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:31,760
but,yeah,i... i guess,Yeah,maybe
i hugged him because i slept.

648
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,530
And that's because of you,Because
you came with me to see my mom,

649
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:37,850
And then i slept,and i
slept without nightmares.

650
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:39,570

Alex... I don't have a brain tumor.

750
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:21,110

754
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,320
No,nothing. nothing.

755
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:35,730
Uh,your kidneys are a little
slow. We're just gonna watch them.

756
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:39,100
Okay. so you'll just recheck
my electrolytes in an hour?

757
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:41,370
Okay.

How did the surgery go?

759
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:48,640
Did you get the tumor?

760
00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:53,250
We did.

761
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:55,370
The tumor's gone.

762
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:58,300
There was a little bit of
bleeding,And we took care of that.

763
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:00,300
You got it?

764
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,590
Oh,my god.

765
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:07,040
And i can talk,and you didn't kill me.

766
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:11,230
What's wrong with you people?
we should be celebrating.

767
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:18,940
She's like the woman Who couldn't
remember her husband was dead.

768
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:20,140
We had to keep telling
her every five minutes.

769
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,690
could be a perfectly
normal post-operative haze.

770
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,800
Or the bleeding during the procedure
Blitzed her short-term retention.

771
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:26,810
Did you screw up her brain?

772
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:28,450
karev--

773
00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:30,710
i'll be back. try and stay calm.

774
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:33,000
Freaking her out is not gonna help.

775
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:40,280
Wake up.

776
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:43,720

-What do we got?
-we got roadkill.

780
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:55,560
You mind? he stepped out in front of a moving
bus So he could pull a woman out of the way.

781
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:57,320
-he's a hero.
-can you fix the arm?

782
00:51:57,390 --> 00:51:57,970
Fingers are already blue.

783
00:51:57,990 --> 00:51:59,550
if it's gonna happen,It's
gotta be in the next few hours.

784
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:01,270

798
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,460
You think he's gonna make it?

799
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:50,400
I hope so.

800
00:52:51,850 --> 00:52:54,020
He really has to make it.

801
00:52:57,170 --> 00:52:58,180
Dr. sloan.

802
00:52:58,250 --> 00:52:59,860
There's gonna be too much tension.

803
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,210
Start over and do a layered closure.

804
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:06,920
Um,c--uh,c-can i ask
a question about that?

And we go to our
girlfriends and we bitch,

And our girlfriends say,"you want
to build a future,"build it yourself.

821
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:09,730
"you don't need a man to give you that.

822
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:11,660
"so you want to buy a house?

823
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:13,780
Buy a house.

824
00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:18,480
" You're good at this.

825
00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:20,510
i ought to help someone get a love life.

826
00:54:20,530 --> 00:54:22,690
I suck at my own.

827
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:27,080
He jumped in front of a bus... for me.

828
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:31,250
-What did you do to o'malley?
-excuse me?

829
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:36,580
Uh,somebody else around here likely to convince someone
To join the army and be a trauma surgeon in iraq?

830
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:37,880
-what?!
-the army?!

831
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,070
What?

832
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:42,160
-v-fib. -charge
the paddles to 360.

833
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:44,180
Just call who you have
to call and undo this.

834
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:45,540
Dr. bailey,little busy here.

835
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,450
-Clear.
-george? george o'malley?

836
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:48,940
It wasn't my idea.

837
00:54:49,090 --> 00:54:50,640
-no change.
-Charge again.

838
00:54:50,670 --> 00:54:51,970
clear.

839
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,450
I did what i could to give him
a decent education in trauma.

840
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:56,590
I didn't know he was
gonna go and enlist.

841
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:01,380
-He keeps coding. -here's
why-- open-book pelvic fracture.

842
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,100
There's too much bleeding.

843
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,810
We take him to an o.r.
now,he'll die on the table.

844
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:07,590
He needs to go to angio if we're gonna
stop The pelvic arterial bleeding.

845
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:08,750
sinus tach. we have a rhythm.

846
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:10,740
It's barely there,but it's there.

847
00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:12,460
let's stabilize the pelvis.

848
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,170
I know what goes on in this hospital.

849
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:17,870
I know you're messed up from
that war,And not in a small way.

850
00:55:18,230 --> 00:55:20,060
get him out of it.

851
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:23,830
Page me if you need me.
i've got other patients.

852
00:55:25,930 --> 00:55:28,270
How'd you piss off all the women?

853
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:31,880
um,let's get our guy to angio.

854
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:33,400
Angio? he's barely got a pulse.

855
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:35,860
it's now or never if we
want him to live. let's move.

856
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:42,390
Sir,i know it's tough,But i'd personally be very grateful
If you'd try and stay alive for the next few minutes.

857
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:48,090
Maybe we're bouncier in
peds than in general surgery,

858
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:52,920
But i thought that there would
be a "yay" Or some jumping around.

859
00:55:52,970 --> 00:55:56,840
'cause you look pretty dour for someone Who's
about to start a highly prized fellowship.

860
00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:01,350
you are about to start a
highly prized fellowship,right?

861
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:03,340
Hey,i've got a plan to
stop george. are you in?

862
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:04,220
stop george from what?

863
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:06,980
He joined the army. yes,i'm in.

864
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:10,260
Bailey,i'm talking to you.

865
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:13,030
why are you trying to stop him?

866
00:56:13,430 --> 00:56:15,320
-Because he joined the army.
-and?

867
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:17,780
And because he's my ex-husband,

868
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:20,420
And i know his mom and i love his mom,

869
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:22,810
And normally izzie would
talk sense into him,

870
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:25,630
But she's got cancer and
kind of a bad mental deficit,

871
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,390
So it's on me to stop him.

872
00:56:27,530 --> 00:56:28,270
but why would you want to stop him?

873
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,900
Because he joined the army.
Don't you think that's a problem?

874
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,510
i think that's awesome.

875
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:35,120
Awesome?

876
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,060
You gonna chew?

877
00:56:45,330 --> 00:56:48,160
My dragged-under-a-bus guy's in angio,And
they're gonna page me any minute.

878
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,080
How's izzie? is she retaining anything?

879
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:51,190
no.

880
00:56:51,590 --> 00:56:58,940
Okay,uh,at 6:00 p.m.,Your idiotic colleague george
o'malley Will finish his surgery with the chief.

881
00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:03,380
and at 6:00 p.m.,You will be standing beside us in
the o.r. hallway,Prepared to join in an intervention.

882
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,530
what polite company might
call an intervention,

883
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:10,340
Though i'm not sure interventions Involve
whooping people on the behind with a belt.

884
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:12,310
What,he's got a drinking problem now?

885
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:13,070
he joined the army.

886
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:14,380
-What?!
-007?

887
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,510
he can't go to army. He's
the guy that gets killed.

888
00:57:16,550 --> 00:57:18,400
he's that guy who gets
killed cleaning his own gun.

889
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,430
Grey is going to coax him
back as a loving friend.

890
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:26,100
You are going to use logic and reason
To point out the idiocy of his ways.

891
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:28,490
Stevens will make sad cancer eyes.

892
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:30,190
And if all of that doesn't work,

893
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:34,490
karev,you're gonna pull out Your "i was
raised out back with the trash cans" roots

894
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:36,410
And just beat the crap out of him.

895
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:38,510
-6:00.
-6:00.

896
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:47,150
Hey there.

897
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:52,450
I know this must be scary,but if it's
any consolation,You're a hard-core hero.

898
00:57:52,590 --> 00:57:54,690
You saved that woman's life.

899
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:04,590
I-is he trying to write something?

900
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,860
Can you hold this?

901
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:22,130
Oh,okay.

902
00:58:22,170 --> 00:58:24,060
You'll be stronger tomorrow.

903
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:27,410
call o.r. one. tell 'em
to get ready for him.

904
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,870
Amanda,you can't be out here.

905
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:37,540
Would you want to be all
alone at a time like this?

906
00:58:38,270 --> 00:58:42,970
We had 30 seconds of interaction
Before he saved my life,And...

907
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,180
and i wasn't even nice.

908
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:50,160
I was standing on a corner when this...

909
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:55,220
Ordinary-looking guy stands
next to me and smiles,And...

910
00:58:56,260 --> 00:59:00,070
and i'm so busy Scoping
for someone hotter that...

911
00:59:02,030 --> 00:59:04,780
I don't even give him a second look.

912
00:59:05,110 --> 00:59:08,910
And next thing i know,he throws me Out of
the way of a bus i'm about to walk in front of

913
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,990
And almost gets himself killed.

914
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:15,670
He literally... he swept me off my feet.

915
00:59:16,610 --> 00:59:19,900
That is my prince in that bed.

916
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:24,430
Okay,you can stay until
they take him to surgery.

917
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:38,320
Uh,not a good time.

918
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:42,300
you know what? you walk away from me again,I
swear i will grab you by the hair and pull hard.

919
00:59:42,350 --> 00:59:43,220
I grew up with the name arizona.

920
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:45,270
I learned how to play
dirty on the playground.

921
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:47,360
I stuck my neck out for
you. you were my pick.

922
00:59:47,370 --> 00:59:50,280
and i appreciate that,but
it's a big decision.

923
00:59:50,290 --> 00:59:52,160
It's not,frankly. it's the brass ring.

924
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:55,120
It's the most exclusive,it's the most
competitive,And we're as good as it gets.

925
00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:57,150
Nobody lands this thing and says no.

926
00:59:57,300 --> 01:00:02,540
My husband informed me yesterday
That if i accept the peds fellowship,

927
01:00:02,650 --> 01:00:05,820
If i sign on for another
two years of training

928
01:00:05,870 --> 01:00:10,770
And the hours and the workload that come with
it When i could be a general surgery attending

929
01:00:10,770 --> 01:00:14,790
And make it home for
dinner,He will divorce me.

930
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:18,620
it's a big decision.

931
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:33,870
You're gonna have a hard
time saving that arm.

932
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:36,930
I can get him back to full
function If i can get there in time.

933
01:00:37,450 --> 01:00:39,910
-I'm thinking about buying a house.
-good for you.

934
01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:43,790
Meredith and i are gonna go
to city hall this afternoon.

935
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,830
-We're getting married.
-really?

936
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:47,830
-That's great news.
-i know.

937
01:00:48,070 --> 01:00:51,050
-If i could just save stevens---
You're allowed to be happy.

938
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:52,900
you're allowed to get married.

939
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,470
You've earned that right.

940
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:57,470
Congratulations,you lucky
bastard. Come here. give me a hug.

941
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:01,500
Why is everyone hugging today?

942
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:03,680
Oh,the blushing bride.

943
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,500
All right,here is the
plan for our john doe.

944
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,330
Shepherd,you'll evacuate the epidural.

945
01:01:07,410 --> 01:01:09,050
Grey and i will correct
the internal injuries.

946
01:01:09,490 --> 01:01:11,640
That'll make room for torres
to place the internal fixator.

947
01:01:11,790 --> 01:01:16,270
Sloan,you should still have time to work on the arm
If the patient doesn't get too acidotic or hypothermic.

948
01:01:16,390 --> 01:01:17,870
Do you think he has a shot?

949
01:01:17,950 --> 01:01:20,190
i've seen people come back from worse.

950
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:26,850
Hey,i thought you were in surgery.

951
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:27,990
I'm on my way.

952
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:30,040
have you talked to bailey About
this peds and tucker thing?

953
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:33,300
no,i talked to bailey about
the army thing and george.

954
01:01:33,410 --> 01:01:35,130
Are you upset with me?

955
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:38,700
No,i'm awesome.

956
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:43,150
-Calliope-- no,do not--
do not "calliope" me,okay?

957
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:44,170
You said it was awesome.

958
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:47,900
George--sweet,kind george
who can't even kill a fly--

959
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:51,430
Is joining the army to go to iraq In the
middle of a war,and you said "awesome.

960
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:53,910
-" it is awesome.
-No,it is not awesome.

961
01:01:53,930 --> 01:01:56,050
god! who are you?

962
01:01:59,190 --> 01:01:59,900
** how's the arm?

963
01:02:00,010 --> 01:02:03,960
the nerves are still intact.
Just have to reattach the vessels.

964
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,210
you ready for me?

965
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:07,820
I'm almost done with the
major internal crush injuries.

966
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:09,470
Pelvis will be all yours in a minute.

967
01:02:09,610 --> 01:02:11,060
Give me some more laps,please.

968
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,300
you think you could do it?

969
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:14,500
Step in front of a bus
for a perfect stranger?

970
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:15,950
we'd all like to
think we would,but--

971
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:19,180
That's more or less what major hunt's been
doing Every day for the last couple of years.

972
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:20,170
oh,no,the guys did.

973
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:24,690
i just came in behind 'em With a
dustpan and a broom and swept up.

974
01:02:24,770 --> 01:02:26,980
You sewed up soldiers under fire.

975
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:29,030
You didn't sweep up.

976
01:02:31,310 --> 01:02:32,620
How do you think o'malley
is gonna do over there?

977
01:02:32,730 --> 01:02:35,440
You think--you think
he can handle it?

978
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:36,950
no,i don't.

979
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:38,610
I think he's gonna surprise us all.

980
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:40,440
I think he's coming back in a body bag.

981
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:42,450
I think you all should just shut up.

982
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:44,300
Just shut the hell up.

983
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:48,750
Please. shut up.

984
01:02:52,790 --> 01:02:56,130
"Shepherd got your whole tumor out."

985
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:58,130
Oh,my god.

986

Alex,why didn't you tell me?

987
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:02,040
<i>Your memory sucks</i>

988
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:04,020
- Oh.

989
01:03:04,050 --> 01:03:06,050
You remember what time you woke up this morning?

990
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:08,760
Um,not exactly.

991
01:03:08,790 --> 01:03:11,250

992
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:14,890
- "o'malley joined the army"?What?
- yeah,he's gonna be a trauma surgeon in iraq.

993
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:16,320
When'd you wake up?

994
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:18,700
7:45.he's gonna get killed.

995
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,160
yeah,we're dealing with it.

996
01:03:20,190 --> 01:03:22,880
Did you know about this george thing?

997
01:03:22,910 --> 01:03:24,840
Yep.
canon fodder.

998
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,370
I'm just gonna take some more blood.

999
01:03:26,390 --> 01:03:29,480
Last time we checked,your potassium was 6.3. When'd you wake up?

1000
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:32,340
um,early.
i can't quite remember.i...

1001
01:03:32,370 --> 01:03:36,310
7:45. 6.3. 7:45.

1002
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:40,010
"o'malley joined the army"?

1003
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:42,740
- george?
- We're dealing with it.

1004
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:44,160
What's your potassium?

1005
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:46,460
- Uh,i...
- Iz,what's your potassium?

1006
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:50,570
you know what?Why don't we just give her the chart to read And try and memorize,okay?

1007
01:03:50,590 --> 01:03:53,140
And i can talk to you about her hyperkalemia.

1008
01:04:00,890 --> 01:04:05,330
Look,she just had brain surgery And an incredibly aggressive course of i.l.-2.She needs rest.

1009
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:08,320
she needs to exercise whatever memory she's got left Before it all turns to mush.

1010
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:11,170
well,she's not gonna heal With you barking orders at her like a caveman.

1011
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:12,710
- Butt out,yang.
- no,she's my patient.

1012
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:14,150
- i don't care if you're her husband.
- Look,she--

1013
01:04:14,170 --> 01:04:16,260
you want to see how fast i can get your visiting hours Down to zero?

1014
01:04:16,290 --> 01:04:17,760
she signed a d.n.r.

1015
01:04:17,790 --> 01:04:21,360
she signed a friggin' d.n.r. And made me promise she'd come outta this with a life.

1016
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:23,550
Not in a hospital bed,not with no brain,

1017
01:04:23,570 --> 01:04:25,420
I had to promise she'd have a life.

1018
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:28,270
You want to know what happens If she can't make any new memories?

1019
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:29,970
Forget about being a doctor.

1020
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,010
She's gonna need round-the-clock babysitters.

1021
01:04:32,030 --> 01:04:34,950
We get an apartment together,and she can't ever Find her way to the damn toilet.

1022
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:38,210
Tracker on her ankle in case,god forbid,She wanders out the front door!

1023
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:40,920
alex,you can handle this.

1024
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:44,410
- she will get better.
- Maybe. maybe not.

1025
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:48,130
it's on me.
Her future is on me.

1026
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:56,030
Is he gonna be okay?

1027
01:04:56,050 --> 01:04:58,030
We'll know more in the morning.

1028
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,310
Go ahead.

1029
01:05:20,290 --> 01:05:22,850
How's she doing?
any better?

1030
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:28,580
- No.
- damn.

1031
01:05:28,590 --> 01:05:33,520
Well,i'm going to city hall To go

1032
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:35,830
- do the thing.
- Seriously?

1033
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:38,240
it doesn't seem like the day for it.

1034
01:05:39,870 --> 01:05:41,460
look at alex.

1035
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:45,230
He's in there working so hard all day,And she doesn't know.

1036
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:49,180
And if she stays like this,She may never know how much he loves her.

1037
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:52,910
And that girl amanda... She's in there loving a stranger.

1038
01:05:52,930 --> 01:05:55,530
She thinks that's her prince charming.

1039
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:59,020
I mean,he's probably gonna die today,chances are.

1040
01:05:59,060 --> 01:06:01,160
So yeah,i'm gonna go get married.

1041
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:04,280
Because i think it's important to take the time

1042
01:06:04,310 --> 01:06:09,120
To tell the people you love how much you love them While they can hear you.

1043
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:23,520
I love you,cristina yang.

1044
01:06:27,970 --> 01:06:30,270
You have changed.

1045
01:06:30,290 --> 01:06:32,710
maybe i have.

1046
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:36,850
What?

1047
01:06:36,870 --> 01:06:39,030
I'm gonna hug you.

1048
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:54,900
Maybe I don't understand people. I don't see things.

1049
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:58,090
So maybe i just don't get What's going on with you or why you're so mad,

1050
01:06:58,110 --> 01:07:01,540
But i do think it's awesome.I think that george joining the army is awesome.

1051
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:04,360
- um,shut up.
- Um,no.

1052
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:06,420
you asked me who i was.

1053
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:11,350
I am a person who thinks that what george is doing Is dangerous and terrifying and brave.

1054
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:12,890
He's going to serve his country.

1055
01:07:12,910 --> 01:07:15,700
He's going to risk his life to save the men and women

1056
01:07:15,730 --> 01:07:19,820
Who make it possible for you and i To sleep safely in our beds.

1057
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:22,920
I'm a person who thinks that that is brave.

1058
01:07:22,930 --> 01:07:26,260
And i am a person who stood in an airplane hanger

1059
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:30,390
And watched them unload my brother's body In a coffin...

1060
01:07:30,410 --> 01:07:33,520
and all we got was a flag.

1061
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:38,810
my brother died over there Because there weren't enough doctors,callie.

1062
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:41,760
So for my money,george o'malley is a patriot.

1063
01:07:41,790 --> 01:07:44,630
He's a hero,And i am grateful that he exists.

1064
01:07:44,650 --> 01:07:48,220
So yeah,the word i use is "awesome."

1065
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:50,720
That's who i am.

1066
01:07:57,910 --> 01:08:00,190
I'm sorry.

1067
01:08:07,830 --> 01:08:11,470
- Sorry,i-i didn't realize--
- Oh,no,no,wait.

1068
01:08:23,530 --> 01:08:28,800

1071
01:08:42,230 --> 01:08:45,090
I said-- i said "i love you."

1072
01:08:45,110 --> 01:08:47,750
Me.

1073
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:51,210
Cristina yang.

1074
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:58,870
You traumatized me.And you know that i am s--

1075
01:08:58,890 --> 01:09:02,340
- i am so sorry about--
- Oh,no,damn it.not about the choking.It's...

1076
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:04,700
it's like you come here and then you pull out my icicle

1077
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:06,910
And you make me love you,and i can't--

1078
01:09:06,930 --> 01:09:12,910
I mean,i don't want to--  i-i can't breathe...

1079
01:09:12,930 --> 01:09:15,230
Without you.

1080
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:21,580
You can do this.
cristina,we can do this.

1081
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:25,130
All you have to do is just meet me halfway.

1082
01:09:25,750 --> 01:09:29,160
All you have to do is say yes.

1083
01:09:32,190 --> 01:09:34,510
All you have to do is say yes.

1084
01:09:38,260 --> 01:09:39,810
What's your crit?

1085
01:09:42,570 --> 01:09:44,310
this is disgusting.

1086
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:46,930
I can't believe we serve it to the patients.

1087
01:09:46,950 --> 01:09:51,160
"you keep asking for lime jell-o And don't like it."

1088
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:53,000
So stop giving it to me.

1089
01:09:53,010 --> 01:09:55,140
You get mad if i don't.

1090
01:09:55,170 --> 01:09:57,110
Okay,now what's your crit?

1091
01:09:57,130 --> 01:09:58,770
I don't know.

1092
01:09:58,790 --> 01:09:59,590
i'm tired.

1093
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:01,630
What's o'malley doing tomorrow?

1094
01:10:01,650 --> 01:10:03,950
Joining the army.

1095
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:05,350
i need a break.

1096
01:10:05,370 --> 01:10:07,430
You don't think i need a break?

1097
01:10:07,450 --> 01:10:08,710
suck it up.

1098
01:10:08,730 --> 01:10:10,900
What--god.

1099
01:10:10,930 --> 01:10:13,000
Back off.

1100
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:15,770
I'm sorry if this is hard for you,

1101
01:10:15,790 --> 01:10:20,050
But you are not the one With the short-term memory of a carrot.

1102
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:27,870
go ahead.
get it off your chest.

1103
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:29,560
It's not like i'm gonna remember in five minutes.

1104
01:10:29,590 --> 01:10:32,930
okay,i'm not the one with a carrot for a brain,But i'm married to it

1105
01:10:32,950 --> 01:10:34,760
'cause of some crock of a wedding We walked into,

1106
01:10:34,790 --> 01:10:37,970
and only because The two of us thought you'd be dead within a week.

1107
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:40,450
You made me promise you that you wouldn't live like this.

1108
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:42,160
So now what the hell am i supposed to do,

1109
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:45,500
Smother you with a pillow,Shoot you up with a-an overdose of morphine?

1110
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:47,580
Not really psyched about that.

1111
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:49,790
- leave you?
- Not really psyched about that either.

1112
01:10:49,810 --> 01:10:51,370
So i guess i'm kinda screwed,right?

1113
01:10:51,390 --> 01:10:55,310
I mean,not as bad as you,But not a friggin' walk in the park,either.

1114
01:11:01,970 --> 01:11:04,260
I'm sorry,iz.

1115
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:06,170
No.

1116
01:11:06,190 --> 01:11:10,150
I told you to get it off your chest.you did.

1117
01:11:15,890 --> 01:11:18,030
Did you forget yet?

1118
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:23,410
Nope.not yet.
Give me a minute.

1119
01:11:31,890 --> 01:11:36,770
Um... j-- If there's still a spot for me in general surgery,

1120
01:11:36,790 --> 01:11:38,930
I'd like to take you up on that.

1121
01:11:38,950 --> 01:11:41,580
I spent months trying to talk you off peds.

1122
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:44,640
I finally get on board,and you change your mind?

1123
01:11:44,670 --> 01:11:46,820
Tucker gave me an ultimatum--

1124
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:50,610
The fellowship or our marriage.

1125
01:11:52,970 --> 01:11:54,240
You chose your marriage.

1126
01:11:54,270 --> 01:11:56,300
No,i'm leaving him,

1127
01:11:56,330 --> 01:12:00,360
Because a marriage that resorts to ultimatums,That's not a marriage.

1128
01:12:00,370 --> 01:12:03,800
I mean,what kind of husband does that?

1129
01:12:03,830 --> 01:12:08,800
So... i'm going to be a single mom.

1130
01:12:08,820 --> 01:12:13,710
it's not the time for... New specialties.

1131
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:17,260
damn.

1132
01:12:19,230 --> 01:12:20,460
I'm sorry.

1133
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:26,070
It's just the first time i said it out loud,So it just kinda took the wind out of me.

1134
01:12:26,090 --> 01:12:30,180
Miranda,are you sure about this?

1135
01:12:30,210 --> 01:12:32,350
I mean,he might come around.

1136
01:12:32,830 --> 01:12:36,350
- He... he's just scared.
- Well,we're all scared.

1137
01:12:36,370 --> 01:12:39,100
I mean,if you're not scared,you're not paying attention.

1138
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:44,290
O-one of my residents just signed up to go to war.That's scary.

1139
01:12:44,310 --> 01:12:47,540
Another one just almost lost her life to melanoma.

1140
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:49,860
Now she doesn't know what day it is.
That's scary.

1141
01:12:49,890 --> 01:12:52,840
What tucker's facing isn't scary.

1142
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:55,990
He's just weak.

1143
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:06,610
No,a pat on the back isn't gonna help,sir.

1144
01:13:06,630 --> 01:13:09,490
um,should i go?

1145
01:13:12,530 --> 01:13:15,750
uh... Okay.

1146
01:13:17,290 --> 01:13:19,950
okay.Okay.

1147
01:13:19,970 --> 01:13:24,430
I'll just stand here with you If that's all right.

1148
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:28,680
Yes,sir.
That would be fine.

1149
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:42,250
I thought you were operating on john doe.

1150
01:13:42,270 --> 01:13:43,340
I already did.

1151
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:47,110
right now i'm looking at houses.
One has a stone fireplace,which i like.

1152
01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:49,680
This one has a backyard the size of montana.

1153
01:13:50,930 --> 01:13:53,180
you're buying a house?

1154
01:13:53,190 --> 01:13:56,680
- Yeah.
- Right.

1155
01:13:56,710 --> 01:13:58,100
okay.

1156
01:13:58,120 --> 01:13:59,880
I'm buying a house right now.

1157
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:01,860
It's a buyer's market,and i'm buying a house.

1158
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:05,660
The only reason that you're even talking about a house Is to make me feel bad.

1159
01:14:05,690 --> 01:14:08,110
You're trying to prove that you're moving on without me

1160
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:09,980
So then i'll regret my decision and change my mind.

1161
01:14:10,010 --> 01:14:12,540
okay,is this what women are doing When they say they're moving on?

1162
01:14:12,550 --> 01:14:15,230
yeah.They don't usually take out a home loan to do it,but--

1163
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:18,790
Pathetic.let me be clear.
i'm moving on.

1164
01:14:20,210 --> 01:14:22,150
I'm a better woman than you.

1165
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:28,480
ready to go?

1166
01:14:28,510 --> 01:14:31,320
I just got a page.our john doe needs to go back into surgery.

1167
01:14:31,340 --> 01:14:34,480
Yeah.his post-op c.t. showed a re-bleed.

1168
01:14:34,510 --> 01:14:35,940
I'm gonna have nelson take care of it.

1169
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:38,550
- no,really?
- Yeah.well,i'd prefer to do it myself,

1170
01:14:38,590 --> 01:14:40,400
But i want to check in on izzie.

1171
01:14:40,420 --> 01:14:42,790
Maybe we can go do that first and then go get married after?

1172
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:45,100
no,we can't Because we have the george intervention after that.

1173
01:14:45,130 --> 01:14:46,610
- i'll have nelson do it.
- You know what?

1174
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:48,710
tell them to prep him.We'll run to city hall,

1175
01:14:48,730 --> 01:14:50,680
we'll come back And we'll do it then.

1176
01:14:50,710 --> 01:14:52,440
- meredith--
- No,you know,let's go.

1177
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:54,170

1178
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:55,910

1179
01:14:55,940 --> 01:14:58,840
we'll monitor john doe,I'll go talk george out of joining the army--

1180
01:14:58,860 --> 01:14:59,970
look,we could do this another day.

1181
01:14:59,990 --> 01:15:01,590
There is no other day.

1182
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:03,460
every day is like this.

1183
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:05,290
Every day there's a crisis.

1184
01:15:05,310 --> 01:15:06,650
there's no time.

1185
01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:08,370
- meredith--
- I love you,

1186
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:13,520
and i do want to marry you today,But there is no time.

1187
01:15:19,270 --> 01:15:22,280
- You have a piece of paper?
- For what?

1188
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:24,270
I want to be with you forever,

1189
01:15:24,290 --> 01:15:26,380
And you want to be with me forever.

1190
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:28,100
And in order to do that,

1191
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:33,010
we need to make vows,A commitment,a contract.

1192
01:15:33,030 --> 01:15:35,530
Give me a piece of paper.

1193
01:15:35,550 --> 01:15:38,630
I don't.I-i-i don't.

1194
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:41,040
I-i have post-its.

1195
01:15:42,890 --> 01:15:45,330
Okay.

1196
01:15:48,670 --> 01:15:51,890
What do we want to promise each other?

1197
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:01,620
That you'll love me...

1198
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:04,330
Even when you hate me.

1199
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:09,300
To love each other even when we hate each other.

1200
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:13,310
No running... ever.

1201
01:16:13,330 --> 01:16:16,810
Nobody walks out no matter what happens.

1202
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:18,800
No running.

1203
01:16:18,820 --> 01:16:20,190
what else?

1204
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:25,610
That we'll take care of each other Even when we're old and smelly and senile,

1205
01:16:25,630 --> 01:16:29,180
And if i get alzheimer's and forget you...

I will remind you who i am every day.

1207
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:38,730
To take care when old,senile... and smelly.

1208
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:44,010
This... Is forever.

Sign.

1210
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:52,100
This is our wedding,a post-it?

1211
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:54,830
if you sign it.

1212
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:08,550
Now what?

1213
01:17:08,570 --> 01:17:12,100
Now i kiss the bride.

See that?

1217
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:35,420
Plenty of time.

1218
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:42,520
Gotta do an e.k.g.

1219
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:45,760
What,i don't even get any small talk?

1220
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:48,810
- What's your problem?
- well,i'll tell you.

1221
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:52,230
I know that i'm supposed to be grateful For my "new lease on life,"

1222
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:55,960
But alex marched in here and basically told me

1223
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:59,910
That being married to me Was the worst thing that ever happened to him.

1224
01:17:59,930 --> 01:18:04,720
Yeah,and that he was trying to decide If smothering me with a pillow

1225
01:18:04,750 --> 01:18:08,880
was the best way To put us both out of our misery.

1226
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:16,220
Okay,where is it?

1227
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:17,810
Where is what?

1228
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:20,140
Where's the note that says that?
Did you write that down?

1229
01:18:20,170 --> 01:18:23,040
no.

1230
01:18:24,090 --> 01:18:26,010
No.

1231
01:18:42,890 --> 01:18:46,950
Yes. Yes.

1232
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,330
i've gotta go.
i've gotta find alex.

1233
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:50,760
Go,go.

1234
01:18:55,350 --> 01:18:58,440
Oh,i'm sorry.

1235
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:00,310
i was just-- i was looking for george.Bailey,it's after 6:00.

1236
01:19:00,340 --> 01:19:03,450
Yes,uh,we scheduled an intervention

1237
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:07,550
So that we could give o'malley a piece of our minds About this idiotic army business.

1238
01:19:07,580 --> 01:19:09,080
Now did he leave already?

1239
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:10,980
he never scrubbed in.

1240
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,610
He told me he was enlisting.i sent him home,

1241
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:16,880
Told him to spend the day with his mom Since he was leaving so soon.

1242
01:19:16,910 --> 01:19:18,840
Uh,he took off this morning.

1243
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:28,220
- How's his i.c.p.?
- worse. o.r. is expecting us.

1244
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:29,780
I thought you were getting married.

1245
01:19:29,820 --> 01:19:31,890
- we did.
- Oh,congratulations.

1246
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:33,940
You sure you want to start your honeymoon in an o.r.?

1247
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:35,590
we're sure.

1248
01:19:37,330 --> 01:19:38,570
You can't be in here.

1249
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:40,780
I'll come and get you in the waiting room.

1250
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:43,750
Hold his hand until you put him under.

1251
01:19:43,770 --> 01:19:46,100
It really does make him feel better.

1252
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:56,830
well,you made a good friend there.

1253
01:19:56,850 --> 01:19:59,550
I guess that happens when you take a bus for somebody.

1254
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:06,650
I know this is scary,But you do have a great team up there.

1255
01:20:08,630 --> 01:20:11,300
You want to try to write again?

1256
01:20:12,740 --> 01:20:14,490

Oh,god! oh,god.

Telling your wife you're trying to figure out how to off her?

01:20:53,850 --> 01:20:57,000
Oh,mind your own bus-- Wait.

- She told me.

1266
01:21:02,180 --> 01:21:03,820
You remember?

1267
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:07,220
Pillow or morphine.

1268
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:08,770
Oh,i'm so sorry.
i didn't mean that.

1269
01:21:08,790 --> 01:21:09,820
Of course you didn't.

1270
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:14,030
You love me too much to shoot me up with morphine Even if i asked you to.

1271
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:17,040
And my stupid corked brain is coming back.

1272

1291
01:22:07,210 --> 01:22:08,830
She knew this might happen.

01:22:08,850 --> 01:22:09,890
i don't give a crap what she signed.

1293
01:22:09,910 --> 01:22:12,470

1312
01:23:11,910 --> 01:23:16,360
drink it in.

1313
01:23:43,530 --> 01:23:46,750
