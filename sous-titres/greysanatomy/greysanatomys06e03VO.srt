00:00:01,293 --> 00:00:02,377
<i>Paranoia...</i>

2
00:00:03,921 --> 00:00:05,631
<i>gives you an edge in the O.R.</i>

3
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:09,092
What I realized is that peds is the only specialty

4
00:00:09,218 --> 00:00:12,846
where I could do it all... You
know, cardio, general, ortho.

5
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,015
It's like the whole body is your canvas,

6
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:16,850
and the fact that it's a small canvas

7
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,685
makes it even more challenging.

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,730
I have no idea if you have someone
on your service right now, but

9
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,941
I would really love to witness your artistry.

10
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,192
You got this?

11
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:26,944
You gotta like kids.

12
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,863
- I love kids.
- I'll see you on rounds.

13
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:30,906
Great.

14
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:35,285
He lost a huge chunk of flesh.
I see down to his mandible.

15
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,621
We'll need plastics and an E.N.T. consult, too.

16
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,958
Left I.V. looks like it's clotted
off. I need a new 16 gauge in there.

17
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,920
What's going on? It's 4:00 in
the morning. Is everyone on call?

18
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,922
It's the merger. Everyone's scared to go home.

19
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:49,258
I don't think the Chief meant
that people couldn't sleep.

20
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,301
It's hard to sleep when your job is on the line.

21
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:54,221
One of you, get as much type-specific
blood as they'll let you have

22
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:55,722
and meet us in surgery.

23
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:59,810
<i>Surgeons play out worst-case
scenarios in their heads.</i>

24
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:02,855
I talked to Callie last night
about the residents at Mercy West.

25
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,731
She said they don't suck.

26
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,608
You're safe because of Derek.

27
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,652
Izzie's safe 'cause of cancer.

28
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:10,612
Alex is Bailey's new favorite.

29
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,115
Even George would've been
spared, 'cause he's Owen's guy.

30
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:16,577
Cardio has been a revolving door
around here, and no one's got my back.

31
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:18,245
So Arizona is your cover?

32
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:20,956
She's merger-proof. She keeps little kids alive.

33
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:22,833
No one likes a dead kid.

34
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,752
Plus, they're under anesthesia
half the time. How bad can it be?

35
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:29,173
<i>You're ready to close, you got the bleeder,</i>

36
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:33,218
<i>you know it, but there's
that voice in your head asking...</i>

37
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:36,263
Sloan and Shepherd are scrubbing
out of surgery in O.R. two.

38
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:37,681
Grab 'em before they leave.

39
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,766
Let me know if you hear anything about the merger.

40
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:42,227
Nurses are always the last to know, first to go.

41
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,812
<i>What if you didn't?</i>

42
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:46,440
<i>What if the patient dies
and you could've prevented it?</i>

43
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,070
What do you think? Looks real, right?

44
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:53,780
My mom sent it to me.

45
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:55,949
What are you doing here?

46
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,911
- Working.
- Iz, we talked about this.

47
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:01,580
You're supposed to be taking another
three weeks, really resting up.

48
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:04,583
I have to come back now, before I
don't have a job to come back to.

49
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,752
I have to show people that I'm not gonna die.

50
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:09,963
Unless I sit alone in that trailer for
one more minute, then I'm gonna die.

51
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:12,049
- I'm gonna die of boredom.
- Look, Izzie...

52
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:14,384
seriously, it looks real, right?

53
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:16,053
If you didn't know I have cancer,

54
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:19,306
you wouldn't know I have cancer, right?

55
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:24,019
<i>So you check your work
one more time before you close.</i>

56
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,773
<i>Paranoia is a surgeon's best friend.</i>

57
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:29,191
Karev, what do you got?

58
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:33,862
16-year-old helmeted dirt bike victim.
G.C.S. 15 reported before intubation.

59
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,698
Okay. On my count. Ready? One, two, three.

60
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,076
I'm gonna scrub in.

61
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:43,413
So he announces a merger, and then he
shuts himself in his office all day

62
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,124
- and refuses to talk to anybody.
- This merger won't affect us.

63
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,253
- It's just a financial restructuring.
- What do you think restructuring is?

64
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:52,214
Cutting personnel. Are you prepared
to lose all the good people? I'm not.

65
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,758
Tell Hunt he's good to go.
I'll write up a consult later.

66
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,386
I'm gonna go talk to Richard right now.

67
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,932
You're tired. You're angry. You're
gonna say something you'll regret.

68
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:04,768
Get outta here for a while. Go to the
driving range, hit a bucket of balls.

69
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:06,854
- I have a surgery in an hour.
- So take a walk.

70
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:09,940
- Grab Meredith, take a walk.
- Meredith won't leave the hospital.

71
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:12,734
None of 'em will. Everyone's
awaiting word from on high.

72
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,987
Look, don't tell me Lexie's not worried.

73
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:17,281
Is he in there?! 'cause I've got the...

74
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,120
No. Lexie's worried.

75
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:29,459
<i>S06E03 I Always Feel
Like Somebody's Watchin' Me</i>

76
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,422
I think you missed a spot.

77
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:36,758
You can't tease me about the blood
thing because it's not funny.

78
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,887
And if it gets back to the Chief,
I may as well just pack my things.

79
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,848
You need to stop worrying about the
Chief. All this is in your head.

80
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:45,642
Really? 2002, Milwaukee,

81
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:49,188
Third Street Hospital merged with
st. Ann's. 13 residents were let go.

82
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:52,191
2004, Nashville Women's absorbed Memorial.

83
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,360
Nine residents were fired. 2006, Albuquerque.

84
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,238
- 19 residents...
- All right. Stop.

85
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,657
You need to pull yourself together.

86
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,035
You deserve to be here.

87
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,745
Act like it.

88
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:12,211
I meant later. After you went
home and got some sleep.

89
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,883
We really should get some sleep before rounds.

90
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:21,220
Sleep is for wimps. Sleep is
for Mercy West residents.

91
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,097
Let's fit in another trauma before rounds.

92
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,393
Don't say anything about the wig.

93
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:30,187
I'm back.

94
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:33,023
Yes, I am early. But whatever. I'm back.

95
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:34,650
And because I've been gone so long,

96
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,236
the first trauma that comes
through those doors, it's mine.

97
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,320
Got it?

98
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:45,327
It's amazing, right?

99
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:47,913
- What's amazing?
- The wig.

100
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,790
It looks so real, I couldn't even tell.

101
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,376
I've always wanted to try out
being a redhead, so I just thought,

102
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,586
- now's the time.
- What's wrong with your own hair?

103
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:56,171
That's peach fuzz chemo hair,

104
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,091
and I really wanted to put my patients
at ease, make 'em feel comfortable.

105
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:01,885
She looks like a stepford
wife. You've gotta tell her.

106
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,638
She can't handle it. Just don't stare.

107
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:07,057
M.V.C. who do I have?

108
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,228
I'm not your Chief resident
anymore. Figure it out.

109
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,438
Karev, let's go.

110
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,321
- You're back.
- I am.

111
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:24,700
- My mom's whole church prayed for you.
- Thank you.

112
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:28,245
- It looks really real.
- I know, right?

113
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:32,040
We need to talk.

114
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,209
- Look, I'm busy right now.
- Are you making cuts?

115
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:36,461
I said I'm busy.

116
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:39,131
If you're making cuts in my department,
you need to consult with me.

117
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:41,842
When it's appropriate, I'll consult
the people I need to consult with.

118
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:44,136
People? I'm not people. I'm
the guy that saved your ass.

119
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,138
When Jennings came to me, you were done.

120
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:47,973
- Out of loyalty to you...
- Loyalty?

121
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:50,851
You came to me so you would look like
a good guy before you stole my job.

122
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,686
Are you making whole cuts or not?

123
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,772
I said when I'm ready to tell my staff
about decisions I will be making,

124
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:56,690
I will...

125
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:57,858
when I'm ready!

126
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:01,445
So don't come barging in here like I
owe you. I don't owe you a damn thing,

127
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:02,988
You work for me.

128
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,532
I'm still the Chief of surgery at this hospital.

129
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:08,118
Then start acting like it.

130
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,707
Jodie Crowley... 60-year-old driver

131
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:15,918
who lost consciousness and hit a parked car.

132
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,754
Vital signs stable. Complains of abdominal pain.

133
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,839
It wasn't a parked car. It was them. They hit us.

134
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:23,675
- Sir, who are you?
- Who am i? Who are you?

135
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,220
- He's my son.
- Why don't we go in the waiting room?

136
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,846
He needs to stay with me.

137
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:29,640
He's a paranoid schizophrenic.

138
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:39,107
Let's put her on a gurney on my count.

139
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:40,859
One, two, three.

140
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:46,865
Listen to me, mom. They're
trying to get to me through you.

141
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:49,535
- You have to believe me.
- Tom, they're not real.

142
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,620
Look at me. Look at me, honey.

143
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:54,164
Did you feel dizzy or
light-headed before the crash?

144
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:55,290
No, I felt fine.

145
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,085
Abdominal tenderness. I feel a mass.

146
00:06:58,252 --> 00:06:59,878
I've had it for quite a while.

147
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,130
Maybe that's what caused me to black out.

148
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:05,008
I've been warning her. They're trying
to hurt her, but she won't believe me.

149
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,260
Tom, look at me.

150
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:10,055
- You know I wouldn't lie to you.
- No. No! You have to believe me.

151
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:15,185
Someone has to believe me. Aliens
have impregnated my mother.

152
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:30,158
the Chief was spotted
five hours ago in the cafeteria.

153
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,911
he got an apple and a
yogurt. And then he met with dr. Shepherd.

154
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:35,372
- The meeting was brief and heated.
- Then he drew the blinds.

155
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:37,374
- He's probably sleeping.
- That's speculation.

156
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:39,877
- We have no proof of that.
- You'd make a good lawyer...

157
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,087
If this doesn't work out.

158
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:45,340
Okay, dr. Yang. You ready for rounds?

159
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,761
Continue with
your course of treatment

160
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:52,181
and keep me updated on any new developments.

161
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,517
You know, you don't look ready.

162
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:58,228
No, I'm ready. I
looked over your patient charts,

163
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:00,814
and I noticed you
have a shock wave lithotripsy

164
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:03,275
scheduled for kidney
stones this morning, and I was...

165
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:07,654
I've never done one of
those, so I'm looking forward to it.

166
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:09,406
Now you're ready.

167
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:12,242
- Come on. Let's go.
- Okay. Thanks.

168
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:15,204
Okay, how long
have you had the growth?

169
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:17,414
Can you cover the clock?

170
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,458
The number 5 bothers him.

171
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:22,002
Can you get
something to cover the clock?

172
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:27,883
Are those cameras?

173
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:30,844
Tommy, what
do we need from the store?

174
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,347
Why won't they leave me alone?

175
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:36,266
- Do we need fruit?
- Why won't you leave me alone?

176
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:38,477
What kind of fruit do we need, honey?

177
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,522
What kind of fruit?

178
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:45,567
Apples,

179
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:47,110
pears,

180
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,112
strawberries.

181
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,364
Make a list.

182
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,284
Could you give
him a pencil and some paper?

183
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:57,246
He needs something
to distract him from the voices.

184
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:58,747
Ma'am, the growth?

185
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,502
I'm sorry. I've had it for a while.

186
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:06,088
I've been
meaning to get it checked, but,

187
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:07,923
as you can see, my son's

188
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:11,093
illness is a full-time job.

189
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,766
Karev, I'm gonna need
you to get mr. Crowley's wrist x-rayed

190
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,351
while I get her up to M.R.I.

191
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:21,728
Why can't one
of these fetuses babysit?

192
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:23,689
If that huge
thing's a triple-A, I want in.

193
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:25,190
I can do the wrist.

194
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:26,900
dr. Karev has more experience

195
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:28,777
The patient is
paranoid and hypervigilant,

196
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:30,737
which means he's
bound to pick up on the fact

197
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:32,489
that dr. Karev
doesn't want to be here,

198
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,992
and he may interpret that as
dr. Karev being out to get him.

199
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:39,413
I aced my psych clerkship.

200
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,420
- How'd it go with the Chief?
- Richard's not talking to me.

201
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:47,588
What? Why?

202
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:50,340
I don't know. He's just... He's not himself.

203
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,259
Well, what's
he doing? He's hiding out.

204
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:54,553
How are you holding up?

205
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,805
You've been up
for, like, what, 36 hours?

206
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:59,308
48. But I'm good, actually.

207
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:01,810
I feel like it's all gonna be okay,

208
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,604
like we're all gonna keep our jobs

209
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:06,565
and we're all gonna be
amazing people and live amazing lives.

210
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:11,069
Unstable childhood. I get calm in a crisis.

211
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,363
This is a crisis, right?

212
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,698
I don't know.

213
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,742
I don't know what this is.

214
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:20,454
Look who's coming.

215
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,628
Have you seen Sage? She's 6, light brown hair,

216
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:30,172
gorgeous blue eyes. She just had
a tumor removed from her belly

217
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,049
so she has a bandage on her tummy.

218
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:35,010
Why don't you check under
the bed? Maybe she's there.

219
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:39,181
Her labs are better than we expected.

220
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:40,516
She's not under the bed.

221
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:46,104
Maybe try the bathroom?
Maybe she slipped in there?

222
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:49,816
How did she do last
night? Did she get any sleep?

223
00:10:49,942 --> 00:10:51,276
- She did.
- I didn't.

224
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,487
Bathroom's clear.

225
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:55,155
Wait. Shh.

226
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,034
I think that there's something

227
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,370
coming from your pocket.

228
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,748
Is Sage inside your pocket?

229
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,629
She's hiding here.

230
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:13,465
You gotta look in your pocket first.

231
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,467
No, I don't, because I found you already.

232
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:17,719
Now I just need to check your incision site, so...

233
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:19,054
Don't touch it. It hurts.

234
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:22,099
I bet that mr. Bear would like to see Sage's scar.

235
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,351
Wouldn't you, mr. Bear?

236
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:29,314
Yes, I would.

237
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,660
I'm surprised to see you back so soon.

238
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,163
- You look great.
- Thank you. So do you.

239
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:46,498
- How are you feeling?
- I feel great. How do you feel?

240
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,709
What I meant was... I know
what you mean. I feel fine

241
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:51,962
I'm ready to work. Here is mr.
Trinidad's latest pre-op labs.

242
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:54,339
I told him you'd stop in to
say hello before the surgery.

243
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:57,009
And unless there's anything else you
can think of that I need to know,

244
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:58,802
I was gonna run to get his consent form.

245
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:01,638
That pretty much covers it unless
anybody has any questions.

246
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:05,601
Is there anything you can tell us about
the merger? Because I'm having a baby.

247
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:07,769
My wife is having a baby.

248
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:12,065
Resident Megan is having a
baby. Am I gonna lose my job?

249
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,611
Right now, I'm concerned about
my patient. You should be, too.

250
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:25,871
I just got my hair cut.

251
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:28,415
It looks nice.

252
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,669
The nurse out there, the one with
the red hair, she's laughing at me.

253
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,881
You tell her I just got it cut, and
they cut it too short, and that's why

254
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:39,051
- my ears are sticking out.
- I'm sure she's not laughing at you.

255
00:12:41,637 --> 00:12:42,930
How's that feel?

256
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:46,975
It feels like my...

257
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:49,520
hand's falling off. It feels like...

258
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:54,358
They put something in it to make my hand fall off,

259
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:56,193
like it's snakes or something.

260
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:00,280
You don't have a name tag.

261
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:05,369
I guess I don't.

262
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:10,165
The other doctor had a name tag on her coat.

263
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,918
I had to change my lab coat,

264
00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:15,379
- and this one...
- You think I'm an idiot?

265
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:18,465
You're working for them. You've got my mother,

266
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,593
and now you're trying to
get me. Stay away from us.

267
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:25,722
I keep telling you people to stay away from us!

268
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:33,939
I called security. They're on their way.

269
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:36,650
Where's psych? I asked you
to page them an hour ago.

270
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:39,152
I paged them twice. If you
want to see the log book...

271
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:42,155
I want to know how a paranoid
patient managed to get out of the E.R.

272
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:43,240
Where were you?

273
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:45,659
I had stepped away from
my desk to deal with another patient.

274
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:47,953
And normally, being
a punching bag for the doctors

275
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:49,997
is just a part of
the job, but there's a merger,

276
00:13:50,164 --> 00:13:51,540
and we're all being looked at,

277
00:13:51,707 --> 00:13:54,084
and I am not about to go down
for a mistake that wasn't mine.

278
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:57,296
So if you'll excuse me, I'll page psych again.

279
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:04,303
Okay, mr. Trinidad, your shunt
revision is pretty simple.

280
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:06,096
It shouldn't take longer than an hour.

281
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:08,932
But I do need to go over the
possible complications with you.

282
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:10,976
Dr. Stevens, could I have a word?

283
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:13,228
If you could just give me a
minute until I'm done here,

284
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:15,439
I'm sorry. This will only take a minute.

285
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:16,899
Excuse me.

286
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:19,735
What?

287
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,320
- How are you holding up?
- Fine.

288
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:23,697
- Did you take your meds this morning?
- Not yet, but I will.

289
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:26,408
- You're supposed to take them at 9:00.
- It's only a little after 9:00.

290
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:27,534
It's 10:15.

291
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,537
Run down to her locker and get her meds.

292
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:33,373
- Are they in your purse?
- But you don't have to get them.

293
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:35,459
- Yes, you do.
- No, you don't. Alex.

294
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:38,337
I swear to God, if you don't go
and get her pills right now,

295
00:14:38,504 --> 00:14:40,589
I'm gonna hurt you and I'm gonna like it.

296
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:43,717
You can't do this.

297
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:46,637
You can't treat me like I'm sick. My
patients need to have faith in me.

298
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:49,181
- What are you doing?
- Your wig, it was crooked.

299
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:53,602
I'll stop hovering if you
stop acting like an idiot.

300
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,021
Your next pill is at 2:00.

301
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,981
You can't take it on an empty stomach.

302
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,030
Tyler Lee, 9 years old, came in with renal colic

303
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:07,241
three days ago that has not resolved.

304
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:10,953
We are going to be performing
extracorporeal shock wave therapy today

305
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:13,622
to break up the stones in
his ureter so they can pass.

306
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:15,123
No, we're not.

307
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:16,875
Yes, we are.

308
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:19,878
No, we're not,'cause there was no
blood in his urine this morning.

309
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:23,507
Just in case? We should do
the procedure just in case?

310
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:26,301
You want to do a surgical
procedure on a 9 year old

311
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,720
even though it's no longer indicated?

312
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:32,140
No, of course not.

313
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:36,895
So, dr. Yang, do you want to tell
the good news to Tyler and his mom?

314
00:15:38,814 --> 00:15:40,691
It seems as though your son's stones

315
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:42,609
may have passed on their own.

316
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:46,154
- He doesn't need surgery?
- Looks like he healed himself.

317
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:48,532
Can you believe that, dr. Yang?
On your first day in peds.

318
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:51,285
- No, I can't, actually.
- Does this mean I can eat?

319
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:53,287
Dr. Yang can go get you something.

320
00:15:56,957 --> 00:16:00,502
An abdominal aortic aneurysm... 8.7 centimeters.

321
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:03,046
This thing has a 75% chance of rupturing.

322
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:04,506
She's a ticking time bomb.

323
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:07,759
I'm surprised she woke up this
morning, let alone got into a car.

324
00:16:08,177 --> 00:16:10,804
Cancel all my elective surgeries
this afternoon and book an O.R.

325
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:13,473
We need to get her in there A.S.A.P.

326
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,185
Jodie, we're done.

327
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:18,770
I'll meet you back downstairs
to go over the results.

328
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:21,315
- Have you seen Tom?
- I thought he was with you?

329
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,860
He was, but he left. Well, he
attacked me, and then he left.

330
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:27,696
You told me you could handle this.

331
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:29,865
I can... it's under control. Don't worry.

332
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,159
I've called security. I just thought maybe

333
00:16:32,284 --> 00:16:34,495
- his mom would have an idea...
- his mom has a triple-A.

334
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,330
The last thing she needs to know is that

335
00:16:36,455 --> 00:16:38,832
her mentally ill son is loose in the hospital.

336
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:41,210
I know this is bad. I know
this is really, really bad.

337
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:45,005
I'm gonna stop listening to you because
the words you're saying are hurting me.

338
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:46,632
Find him!

339
00:16:58,185 --> 00:17:00,938
- You look crazy.
- This is partly your fault.

340
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:03,982
You're the one who told me to go act
like I deserve to be here and I did

341
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:06,109
and now I lost a schizophrenic.

342
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:09,321
And I am gonna be fired unless
I find the schizophrenic.

343
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,823
You're not gonna find him back there.

344
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:15,661
You do not get to be charmed by
this because this is not charming!

345
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:18,539
This is me getting cut from the program.

346
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:21,166
You're already amazing. I am just starting out.

347
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:23,085
I have never stapled a bowel,

348
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,212
and I have never resected an esophagus.

349
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:26,755
I am not amazing yet!

350
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,924
All right. Let's just breathe.

351
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:30,801
And again.

352
00:17:31,844 --> 00:17:33,178
Good. Look at me.

353
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:35,013
Security is on this.

354
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:37,850
You have become a crazy person I do not recognize.

355
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:42,020
I want Lexie back. Can I get Lexie back?

356
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:43,647
Stay away from me! You get back!

357
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:45,566
- God, that's him.
- Stop! Get back!

358
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:47,901
Where's my mother? What have you done with her?

359
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:07,004
Mrs. Crowley, there is evidence that your son

360
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:09,173
may have suffered some injury in this fall. Now,

361
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:11,383
we don't think that
it's bad but we just need to do

362
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:14,720
an ultrasound to make sure.
He's been sedated, but I need you to wait here

363
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:16,763
until we've
completed this, all right?

364
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:19,349
I never shoulda left him alone.

365
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:21,435
I knew it. I knew it.

366
00:18:23,312 --> 00:18:25,647
I need to talk to you about your test results.

367
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:28,734
The wall of your aorta is dangerously thin

368
00:18:28,901 --> 00:18:30,986
and could burst at any
moment, and when that happens,

369
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:32,613
it will most likely kill you.

370
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,406
I'm not mincing my words right now

371
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:37,159
because I need you to understand
the severity of the situation.

372
00:18:37,326 --> 00:18:39,411
I need to take you up to surgery right now.

373
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:40,829
I can't.

374
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:43,207
I can't have surgery right now.

375
00:18:43,332 --> 00:18:46,168
I can't leave Tom. He's injured. He's upset.

376
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:48,212
This has been a rough day on him.

377
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,006
I can't. No. It'll have to wait.

378
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:54,510
Well, isn't there someone that you can call?

379
00:18:56,345 --> 00:18:58,764
My ex-husband left when tom first got sick,

380
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:01,600
and friends have fallen away. It's only me.

381
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:06,146
We have services, so, we can arrange to...

382
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:09,274
I can't just leave him with a stranger.

383
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:11,777
I need time...

384
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:15,447
To hire someone and train them

385
00:19:16,365 --> 00:19:18,617
to know that if he's watching tv

386
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:20,452
and he's holding his head a certain way,

387
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:22,704
it means the television is talking to him

388
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,540
and he needs to be distracted.

389
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:26,083
He likes shopping,

390
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,002
but they can't take him to the place on Lee Road

391
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:30,921
because he thinks they're out to get him.

392
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:33,131
So they have to go to the place on River Road.

393
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,967
But they've gotta park in the back,

394
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:37,469
because underground parking makes him upset.

395
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:40,305
And it goes on and on and on.

396
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,933
So, no. Please...

397
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:45,602
I need time.

398
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:47,729
A week.

399
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:50,983
I've made it this long. I
can make it another week.

400
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:53,694
I'm not sure that you have another week.

401
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:57,281
I need you to think about yourself right now.

402
00:19:57,656 --> 00:19:59,700
I have a mentally ill son.

403
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:03,370
I don't get to think of just myself anymore.

404
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:19,344
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, I was just,

405
00:20:20,012 --> 00:20:22,181
I just stopped by to get some old case files.

406
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:23,140
For what?

407
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:25,559
This job opening in Portland.

408
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:27,060
Oregon?

409
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:32,357
The merger. I mean, the Chief
already got rid of me once, so...

410
00:20:34,985 --> 00:20:36,403
Well, it's... that's smart.

411
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,864
That's smart of you to have backups.

412
00:20:44,745 --> 00:20:47,080
You know, I'm working with
Cristina. She's interested in peds.

413
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,417
- No, she isn't.
- Yeah, she is.

414
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:54,213
Well, what? Did she say something to you?

415
00:20:54,463 --> 00:20:56,340
She didn't have to. She's Cristina.

416
00:20:56,548 --> 00:20:59,009
You have to help me out here, 'cause
I don't know what that means.

417
00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:01,136
I shouldn't say anything. She's my roommate.

418
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:05,432
And you're my girlfriend.
Girlfriend trumps roommate. Fine.

419
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:08,101
She's Cristina. She's all about cardio.

420
00:21:08,227 --> 00:21:11,063
So she's probably sucking up to
you to get through the merger.

421
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,108
I mean, is she good with the kids?

422
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:17,653
She's sucking up.

423
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:24,660
Nice pin.

424
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,663
His name's mr. Bear. He eats children.

425
00:21:28,372 --> 00:21:29,540
Not having fun in peds?

426
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:33,085
My kid wants chocolate pudding really badly.

427
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,003
This is the last one.

428
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:38,674
My triple-A got canceled. You guys
got any surgeries I can get in on?

429
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,051
No, I'm on post-ops. And she's babysitting.

430
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,512
I can't stand it any longer.
Can't you go to the Chief

431
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:46,348
and use your dead-mommy
connections to get some answers?

432
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:48,892
We don't need dead mommy. We are going to be fine.

433
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:50,894
So I let a crazy man escape,

434
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:53,230
- and he fell down a flight of stairs.
- Is it surgical?

435
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:55,065
I don't know. I got kicked off the case.

436
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:58,360
So then I went to go watch a surgery.
I figured, I can't screw that up.

437
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:00,362
And the second I get to the gallery,

438
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:02,447
the shunt went south and starts bleeding.

439
00:22:02,573 --> 00:22:04,491
I left before Shepherd could blame me for it.

440
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,993
Shepherd's shunt went bad?

441
00:22:06,118 --> 00:22:08,162
They had to convert to an open craniotomy...

442
00:22:08,287 --> 00:22:10,497
something I'll probably never get a chance to do.

443
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:13,167
- She can't handle a craniotomy.
- See? Even he sees it.

444
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,836
He's not talking about you.
He's talking about Izzie.

445
00:22:17,838 --> 00:22:19,256
I really admire you...

446
00:22:19,631 --> 00:22:21,925
in case I get cut and don't
get a chance to tell you.

447
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:23,969
Plus, you're really pretty.

448
00:22:26,638 --> 00:22:28,265
You can have the rest.

449
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:32,769
And you and I, we were getting so close.

450
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,648
I need to speak with dr. Stevens, please.

451
00:22:36,857 --> 00:22:38,609
Alex, I'm in surgery.

452
00:22:39,026 --> 00:22:40,360
Alex, leave.

453
00:22:43,697 --> 00:22:46,283
Dr. Shepherd, could you please
tell dr. Karev to leave?

454
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:48,660
She gets tired walking to the mailbox.

455
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:50,954
She can't handle another 5-hour surgery.

456
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:54,082
- I know what I can handle.
- No one's gonna think any less of you

457
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,335
if you walk out of here now. Just walk out now.

458
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,253
Stevens, have this conversation outside.

459
00:22:58,378 --> 00:22:59,963
No, I'm not leaving. Alex.

460
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:11,558
You paged me. What's going on?

461
00:23:11,683 --> 00:23:13,769
You have to tell the Chief that you need me,

462
00:23:13,894 --> 00:23:15,896
that George was your guy, but he died.

463
00:23:16,063 --> 00:23:17,940
So you need a new guy, and that's me.

464
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:20,025
Okay? Right now. Let's go. Go, go, go.

465
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,902
If anyone's safe in this merger, it's you.

466
00:23:22,027 --> 00:23:24,071
Just be casual but firm. He likes you. Go.

467
00:23:24,905 --> 00:23:27,991
I played hide-and-seek today
and didn't go to surgery

468
00:23:28,158 --> 00:23:30,994
because some 9 year old
miraculously peed without blood.

469
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:32,788
- I can't do this anymore.
- Then don't.

470
00:23:32,913 --> 00:23:35,666
Tell dr. Robbins you don't think peds
is your thing. What's the big deal?

471
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:37,876
The big deal is that the Chief in there right now

472
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:39,962
- making a list...
- You don't know that.

473
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:42,798
A list of who stays and who goes,
and I can't be on that "goes" list.

474
00:23:42,923 --> 00:23:44,800
If you are, you will deal with that.

475
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:47,594
"If" I am? Okay, if I... there can be no if.

476
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:49,847
I have to be on the "stays" list.

477
00:23:49,972 --> 00:23:52,057
That list is everything. That list is my future.

478
00:23:52,182 --> 00:23:55,018
- Calm down.
- It's my salvation. The list is life.

479
00:23:56,103 --> 00:23:59,231
Schindler's list? You're comparing
this merger to the holocaust?

480
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:02,860
- I'm jewish. I'm allowed.
- You're irrational.

481
00:24:05,863 --> 00:24:08,115
- So this is a no?
- This is a no.

482
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:15,706
And somebody page Sloan again, stat.

483
00:24:15,831 --> 00:24:16,957
Right away, doctor.

484
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:20,002
Okay, Elizabeth,

485
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:22,379
Take me through exactly what happened.

486
00:24:22,921 --> 00:24:25,924
I was doing a crash c-section on this 32-weeker.

487
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:28,510
I had the incision done in five minutes flat.

488
00:24:29,094 --> 00:24:32,264
I must have cut too deep, because
when I went in to take the baby,

489
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:34,641
- I pulled the arm a little, and the...
- Oh, my God.

490
00:24:34,808 --> 00:24:36,351
Get me the umbilical cord.

491
00:24:36,768 --> 00:24:38,437
- Umbilical cord?
- Just get it.

492
00:24:49,114 --> 00:24:50,699
I got it. I got the umbilical cord.

493
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:53,076
Good. Give me about 5 centimeters of it.

494
00:24:53,285 --> 00:24:55,871
- What's going on?
- Arm got damaged during a stat "c."

495
00:24:55,996 --> 00:24:58,415
I'm gonna use the
umbilical artery if it's still viable.

496
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,666
It looks a little dry.

497
00:25:03,629 --> 00:25:05,047
It looks like it's gonna work.

498
00:25:05,297 --> 00:25:07,674
She's stable. Let's
put it in antibiotic solution

499
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:09,426
and move this party to the O.R.

500
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:18,560
I'm sorry. I just

501
00:25:18,977 --> 00:25:21,021
I wanted to make sure that you're okay.

502
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:22,648
Are you okay?

503
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:26,026
I injured my spleen,

504
00:25:26,902 --> 00:25:27,986
and they're just

505
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:30,280
waiting to see if it stops bleeding on its own.

506
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:32,074
Good.

507
00:25:33,492 --> 00:25:34,910
I'm glad you seem...

508
00:25:35,911 --> 00:25:38,288
You seem better, and I'm glad.

509
00:25:39,248 --> 00:25:42,334
Anyway, I should go. I'm not
really supposed to be here, so...

510
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:44,920
Oh, it's all right. They've got me in restraints.

511
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:49,383
I wouldn't be able to hurt you
even if the voices told me to.

512
00:25:51,677 --> 00:25:52,761
It's a joke.

513
00:25:54,221 --> 00:25:55,597
Schizophrenia humor.

514
00:26:00,644 --> 00:26:02,771
There's this thought that I...

515
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:05,399
I'm trying to get it out, and...

516
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:09,278
I keep thinking that they planted a camera...

517
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:13,574
in my stomach during the ultrasound.

518
00:26:14,241 --> 00:26:17,452
And I was gonna wake my mother and
have her, you know, talk me down,

519
00:26:18,537 --> 00:26:20,038
but she's tired, and...

520
00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:33,010
Here is...

521
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:36,221
your spleen.

522
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:37,222
See?

523
00:26:37,556 --> 00:26:40,642
And this bright spot right here, that's blood.

524
00:26:41,226 --> 00:26:42,811
That's not supposed to be there.

525
00:26:43,145 --> 00:26:43,937
But...

526
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,231
No camera.

527
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:50,152
No camera.

528
00:26:53,572 --> 00:26:55,365
I can leave this up if you want.

529
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:57,951
So that when the thoughts come back,

530
00:26:58,869 --> 00:27:00,996
you can look and you can
see that they're not real.

531
00:27:01,121 --> 00:27:03,165
They're just scary thoughts.

532
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:05,417
They're not real.

533
00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:18,430
Thank you.

534
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:21,099
Little more suction.

535
00:27:21,391 --> 00:27:22,726
It's 2:00, Izzie.

536
00:27:23,852 --> 00:27:24,770
Oh, my God.

537
00:27:24,895 --> 00:27:27,773
Stevens, no more fighting in
my O.R. go deal with this.

538
00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:35,322
- I hate you.
- Shut up.

539
00:27:54,383 --> 00:27:55,300
Oh, God.

540
00:27:58,262 --> 00:27:59,096
Thank you.

541
00:27:59,263 --> 00:28:00,931
Shut up. Get back to work.

542
00:28:09,523 --> 00:28:11,483
Has mrs. Crowley agreed to the surgery?

543
00:28:12,276 --> 00:28:14,111
She's gonna go home, and she's gonna die.

544
00:28:14,653 --> 00:28:16,321
Then what's that boy gonna be left with?

545
00:28:16,446 --> 00:28:17,489
He needs surgery.

546
00:28:18,323 --> 00:28:19,867
Does he need a transfusion?

547
00:28:19,992 --> 00:28:22,411
- Is there active bleeding?
- No, his crit's stable.

548
00:28:22,578 --> 00:28:25,205
And I know we don't operate
unless there's an active bleed,

549
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:26,415
but it's so close,

550
00:28:26,582 --> 00:28:28,959
and if we operate on him, maybe
she'll let us operate on her.

551
00:28:29,084 --> 00:28:30,627
That way, we can keep them together.

552
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:33,046
Through the surgery, through the
recovery, they'll be together

553
00:28:33,172 --> 00:28:34,756
And maybe you think this is a bad idea

554
00:28:34,923 --> 00:28:36,633
that I'm proposing unnecessary surgery.

555
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,011
And, maybe you'll tell the
Chief, and the Chief will think

556
00:28:39,136 --> 00:28:41,597
that it makes me a bad doctor. But
I think it makes me a good doctor

557
00:28:41,722 --> 00:28:43,098
- And I think
- Stop talking.

558
00:28:43,223 --> 00:28:45,267
Are my words hurting you again?

559
00:28:45,851 --> 00:28:46,894
You're right.

560
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:49,855
It's a good idea.

561
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:55,736
How does this happen? Was Chen
just not paying attention?

562
00:28:55,903 --> 00:28:57,279
She made a mistake.

563
00:28:57,613 --> 00:28:59,573
Wrong time to make a mistake, with the merger.

564
00:28:59,698 --> 00:29:02,951
You people need to stop with the
doom and gloom merger scenarios.

565
00:29:03,076 --> 00:29:05,037
I just read somewhere that the hospital's revenues

566
00:29:05,162 --> 00:29:06,580
actually went up last quarter.

567
00:29:06,705 --> 00:29:09,208
Except for elective procedures,
which went down 13%.

568
00:29:09,374 --> 00:29:12,503
You mean elective procedures
like plastic surgeries?

569
00:29:12,628 --> 00:29:14,379
Now you're saying that I'm gonna get fired?

570
00:29:14,505 --> 00:29:16,381
- I don't think anyone is safe.
- I'm safe.

571
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:18,008
How can you be sure?

572
00:29:18,675 --> 00:29:20,469
We're about to reattach a baby's arm here.

573
00:29:20,636 --> 00:29:22,429
So we need to stop thinking about the merger

574
00:29:22,596 --> 00:29:24,264
and think instead about this little girl

575
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:28,060
throwing a ball and holding a spoon
and waving bye-bye to her parents.

576
00:29:36,568 --> 00:29:38,195
I'm not letting you cut me open.

577
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,905
You're gonna put a camera in me.

578
00:29:40,155 --> 00:29:41,240
You are one of them.

579
00:29:41,406 --> 00:29:42,574
Okay, mrs. Crowley...

580
00:29:43,242 --> 00:29:44,952
He's scared. He said no.

581
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,995
Tom, you need this surgery.

582
00:29:47,579 --> 00:29:50,123
And you will feel better after it. And your mom?

583
00:29:50,624 --> 00:29:53,585
Your mom's surgery will save her life.

584
00:29:58,215 --> 00:30:00,133
Look, Tom. Look at me.

585
00:30:00,926 --> 00:30:03,512
Look at me. Okay? I am not an alien.

586
00:30:03,804 --> 00:30:05,222
I'm not one of them.

587
00:30:05,848 --> 00:30:09,518
My name is Miranda Bailey.
I have a 3-year-old son.

588
00:30:09,643 --> 00:30:11,937
And I would do anything for him,

589
00:30:12,062 --> 00:30:14,147
just like your mom would do anything for you.

590
00:30:14,523 --> 00:30:17,401
Now she needs you to do this

591
00:30:17,943 --> 00:30:21,155
for her. Because otherwise, she will die.

592
00:30:21,905 --> 00:30:23,490
And you will be alone.

593
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,548
Look. See? Red.

594
00:30:40,382 --> 00:30:41,383
Red blood.

595
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:44,344
See? I'm human.

596
00:30:48,515 --> 00:30:49,808
I am a doctor.

597
00:30:50,309 --> 00:30:53,103
And I want to help you and your mom.

598
00:30:54,146 --> 00:30:56,440
But you have to trust me.

599
00:31:09,077 --> 00:31:10,245
I think we're there.

600
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:12,456
If it pinks up, we'll know
we've done our job right.

601
00:31:12,623 --> 00:31:14,750
Releasing the bulldog clamps. Here we go.

602
00:31:33,727 --> 00:31:36,355
That's how I know my job is safe, dr. Yang,

603
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,607
because I reattach babies arms.

604
00:31:44,571 --> 00:31:47,449
You know, it's not a good idea
to piss off your attending.

605
00:31:47,574 --> 00:31:49,701
I didn't know he was upset. I'll apologize.

606
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:51,328
I wasn't talking about him.

607
00:31:53,163 --> 00:31:53,956
Sorry?

608
00:31:54,081 --> 00:31:55,791
I like kids and I like their parents,

609
00:31:55,874 --> 00:31:57,626
and I like to see them smile. So I like

610
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,212
going to get them pudding
and playing games with them,

611
00:32:00,379 --> 00:32:02,548
because it makes attaching
their arms way more fun.

612
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:05,008
I don't like being used.

613
00:32:06,134 --> 00:32:08,554
- I wasn't u...
- And I like being lied to even less.

614
00:32:17,062 --> 00:32:19,231
What do we need from the store, sweetheart?

615
00:32:20,566 --> 00:32:22,568
Tell me what we need from the store.

616
00:32:23,402 --> 00:32:26,446
Apples, pears, strawberries.

617
00:32:26,947 --> 00:32:29,408
Apples, pears, strawberries.

618
00:32:39,084 --> 00:32:40,460
What if I don't make it?

619
00:32:40,586 --> 00:32:43,463
Now you don't worry about that. Let me do that.

620
00:32:55,851 --> 00:32:56,977
Let's go.

621
00:33:08,155 --> 00:33:09,740
The bleeding's stopped.

622
00:33:10,574 --> 00:33:11,825
Let's close up.

623
00:33:13,368 --> 00:33:14,453
Stevens, scrub out.

624
00:33:14,578 --> 00:33:16,580
No, I'm fine. I'm your resident. I got it.

625
00:33:16,747 --> 00:33:18,040
Someone else can close up.

626
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,250
You've been on your feet for five hours.

627
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:22,085
- You look exhausted.
- I'm not. I'm fine.

628
00:33:22,211 --> 00:33:23,754
You're dripping with sweat.

629
00:33:27,466 --> 00:33:29,635
All right. You know what? Just take my wig off.

630
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,512
Just take it off. Take it off.

631
00:33:33,764 --> 00:33:35,474
Just pat down my head.

632
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:40,395
All right. You can just put the cap back on.

633
00:33:43,273 --> 00:33:44,691
Okay, thank you.

634
00:33:47,444 --> 00:33:48,529
I'm fine.

635
00:34:02,501 --> 00:34:05,671
Isobel Stevens spent five hours
on her feet in surgery today,

636
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:07,881
Not because she was ready to go back to work,

637
00:34:08,006 --> 00:34:10,342
but because she was scared.
She's scared for her job

638
00:34:10,926 --> 00:34:12,970
and she was scared to show weakness.

639
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:18,141
You don't have to talk to me. That's fine.

640
00:34:18,308 --> 00:34:20,310
But you need to go out there
and talk to your people.

641
00:34:20,477 --> 00:34:22,813
- They need to hear from you.
- Don't tell me about my people.

642
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,982
I've been here for 30 years, Derek.

643
00:34:25,858 --> 00:34:27,025
I know my people.

644
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,237
I have spent every hour of the last three days

645
00:34:30,362 --> 00:34:31,947
trying to save every job I could.

646
00:34:32,114 --> 00:34:34,032
But some tough choices had to be made.

647
00:34:38,162 --> 00:34:41,039
H.R. is sending out an e-mail to the
first round of people to be let go.

648
00:34:42,082 --> 00:34:44,042
I'm tired. I'm going home.

649
00:34:54,386 --> 00:34:56,346
What's going on? You paged us.

650
00:34:56,471 --> 00:34:57,931
- Check your e-mail.
- For what?

651
00:34:58,056 --> 00:35:00,142
H.R. if you got cut, you'll have an e-mail.

652
00:35:00,267 --> 00:35:01,685
I didn't get one, but...

653
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:05,230
I've been calm. Through this
crisis, I have been calm.

654
00:35:05,355 --> 00:35:08,525
But if one of us gets cut, I will not be calm.

655
00:35:14,198 --> 00:35:15,949
- No e-mail.
- I'm fine.

656
00:35:18,285 --> 00:35:19,286
I'm good, too.

657
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:21,872
Good. See? I knew it.

658
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:24,041
I knew it. I knew none of us would get cut.

659
00:35:25,334 --> 00:35:28,378
Yet. There's gonna be another round.

660
00:35:32,216 --> 00:35:35,344
So I'm there in the spleen repair with dr. Hunt,

661
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,931
and he's got the cautery and he's
moving it back and forth, you know,

662
00:35:39,056 --> 00:35:42,601
fixing bleeders, and then
he just hands it to me...

663
00:35:43,101 --> 00:35:45,938
Like it's the most normal
thing in the world to do,

664
00:35:46,146 --> 00:35:48,565
like I repair spleens all the time.

665
00:35:48,857 --> 00:35:50,859
And so I do it.

666
00:35:51,026 --> 00:35:53,529
I repair the spleen on my own.

667
00:35:54,196 --> 00:35:55,864
And I just... I realized, you know,

668
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:58,116
if we just focus on our jobs,

669
00:35:58,242 --> 00:36:00,828
if we focus on our patients, we're gonna be fine.

670
00:36:01,203 --> 00:36:02,329
Megan got cut.

671
00:36:04,081 --> 00:36:05,624
I didn't, but she did.

672
00:36:05,874 --> 00:36:07,042
What? How?

673
00:36:07,209 --> 00:36:09,336
The Chief sent out an e-mail.

674
00:36:10,379 --> 00:36:12,214
He fired three-quarters of our class.

675
00:36:16,009 --> 00:36:17,427
We're having a baby.

676
00:36:36,196 --> 00:36:37,823
Terry. Hey, Terry.

677
00:36:37,948 --> 00:36:39,700
It's been a real pleasure working with you.

678
00:36:39,867 --> 00:36:42,077
- Thanks
- Sorry about everything.

679
00:36:45,372 --> 00:36:47,499
So what did I do wrong, so
I can learn for next time?

680
00:36:47,624 --> 00:36:49,334
You didn't do anything wrong.

681
00:36:50,002 --> 00:36:51,879
This is about the money.

682
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:03,015
I've been here seven years.

683
00:37:03,265 --> 00:37:04,975
All my friends are here.

684
00:37:05,517 --> 00:37:07,394
I'll find another job, but,

685
00:37:09,062 --> 00:37:11,815
it's seven years. You have no idea.

686
00:37:15,235 --> 00:37:17,362
Look, if you need a job recommendation,

687
00:37:17,821 --> 00:37:19,490
anything, just call me, okay?

688
00:37:27,289 --> 00:37:30,167
- Rough day.
- I need some sleep.

689
00:37:31,001 --> 00:37:32,294
Let's go home.

690
00:37:32,461 --> 00:37:34,546
No, I can't. I just got kicked off of peds.

691
00:37:34,713 --> 00:37:36,548
- I'm totally screwed.
- Cristina, come on...

692
00:37:36,673 --> 00:37:38,759
No, I can't sleep. I can't...

693
00:37:40,469 --> 00:37:42,888
I can't leave if she's not leaving.

694
00:37:45,182 --> 00:37:46,975
<i>We're all susceptible to it...</i>

695
00:37:51,021 --> 00:37:54,149
<i>the dread and anxiety of
not knowing what's coming.</i>

696
00:37:54,525 --> 00:37:55,400
No way.

697
00:37:57,986 --> 00:37:59,530
Are you serious?

698
00:38:01,281 --> 00:38:02,991
I'm gonna go to the Chief myself.

699
00:38:03,158 --> 00:38:06,954
And I'm gonna tell him you're the best
second-year resident I've ever seen.

700
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,122
I'm safe.

701
00:38:10,541 --> 00:38:13,210
I didn't get cut, Mark. I'm safe.

702
00:38:22,052 --> 00:38:23,929
<i>It's pointless in the end...</i>

703
00:38:32,896 --> 00:38:34,565
I hate, hate, hate

704
00:38:35,691 --> 00:38:38,527
this merger because I hate
long-distance relationships.

705
00:38:39,862 --> 00:38:41,572
I don't believe in them. So...

706
00:38:42,447 --> 00:38:43,907
You can't move to Portland.

707
00:38:44,825 --> 00:38:47,077
When I mentioned it this afternoon,
you didn't seem to mind.

708
00:38:47,202 --> 00:38:48,829
You were like, "move to Portland."

709
00:38:48,954 --> 00:38:51,039
I didn't know that I was allowed to mind.

710
00:38:51,165 --> 00:38:52,916
I didn't know if we were girlfriends,

711
00:38:53,041 --> 00:38:55,043
but then, you said "girlfriend." You called me

712
00:38:55,377 --> 00:38:57,838
your girlfriend, so I need to know.

713
00:38:59,548 --> 00:39:00,924
Am I your girlfriend?

714
00:39:09,141 --> 00:39:10,058
Good

715
00:39:10,601 --> 00:39:12,978
So, yeah. No, you're not moving to Portland.

716
00:39:13,103 --> 00:39:15,731
No, but what you are gonna do is you're
gonna go into the Chief's office,

717
00:39:15,856 --> 00:39:17,858
- and you're gonna beg...
- I'm not gonna grovel.

718
00:39:17,983 --> 00:39:20,986
You are. Seriously, you
don't want to mess with me.

719
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:23,405
<i>Because all the worrying...</i>

720
00:39:27,242 --> 00:39:28,619
<i>and all the making of plans</i>

721
00:39:28,744 --> 00:39:31,497
<i>for things that could or could not happen...</i>

722
00:39:37,002 --> 00:39:38,754
<i>it only makes things worse.</i>

723
00:39:39,046 --> 00:39:41,173
I forgot he was dead today.

724
00:39:42,508 --> 00:39:44,510
For a few hours in surgery,

725
00:39:44,635 --> 00:39:47,554
I forgot I had cancer and I forgot he was dead.

726
00:39:50,933 --> 00:39:52,476
But George is dead...

727
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,647
and you do have cancer.

728
00:39:59,983 --> 00:40:02,861
I want you to keep doing what you love.

729
00:40:05,322 --> 00:40:06,865
You're a great doctor.

730
00:40:08,408 --> 00:40:11,328
And you have a fantastic future ahead of you.

731
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:17,042
But you gotta step up and
start taking care of yourself.

732
00:40:18,877 --> 00:40:21,547
You gotta take your meds, you gotta eat,

733
00:40:22,464 --> 00:40:24,091
you gotta pace yourself...

734
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:27,052
Because I can't be your nurse.

735
00:40:28,846 --> 00:40:29,721
I can't.

736
00:40:47,531 --> 00:40:49,158
<i>So walk your dog...</i>

737
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:53,162
<i>or take a nap.</i>

738
00:40:53,453 --> 00:40:55,372
<i>Just, whatever you do,</i>

739
00:40:55,998 --> 00:40:57,082
<i>stop worrying.</i>

740
00:40:57,207 --> 00:40:59,918
I'm sorry. I don't have time for games.
I have to get back to the hospital.

741
00:41:00,085 --> 00:41:02,462
She's right. She does have
to go back to the hospital.

742
00:41:02,588 --> 00:41:05,132
We're not gonna talk about the
hospital. We're here to play baseball.

743
00:41:05,257 --> 00:41:06,216
And drink beer

744
00:41:06,341 --> 00:41:08,969
- Drink a beer.
- What more do you want in life?

745
00:41:09,094 --> 00:41:11,305
How can I drink beer when all
my friends just got fired?

746
00:41:11,471 --> 00:41:13,140
I'm sorry. I'm leaving.

747
00:41:13,807 --> 00:41:16,393
You need this. Put this on. That's right.

748
00:41:16,685 --> 00:41:18,270
There we go.

749
00:41:20,814 --> 00:41:24,318
- Now hit the ball.
- I don't want to hit the ball.

750
00:41:28,822 --> 00:41:30,157
What, are you trying...

751
00:41:31,783 --> 00:41:34,036
You need to stop thinking
about what's gonna happen,

752
00:41:34,161 --> 00:41:36,622
and you need to focus on what
is right in front of you.

753
00:41:36,747 --> 00:41:38,248
Now hit the ball.

754
00:41:49,384 --> 00:41:51,345
<i>Because the only cure for paranoia...</i>

755
00:41:52,763 --> 00:41:54,515
- Now you like baseball.
- Unbelievable.

756
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,517
All right, here we go, little Grey. Let's go.

757
00:41:56,642 --> 00:41:57,601
<i>Is to be...</i>

758
00:41:59,686 --> 00:42:00,562
<i>Here...</i>

759
00:42:04,775 --> 00:42:06,068
<i>Just as you are.</i>
