1
00:00:14,303 --> 00:00:17,538
dying isn't easy.

2
00:00:20,194 --> 00:00:23,030
The body was designed
to stay alive...

3
00:00:24,365 --> 00:00:25,966
Thick skulls...

4
00:00:27,033 --> 00:00:30,075
Strong hearts...

5
00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:32,023
Keen senses.

6
00:00:54,858 --> 00:00:56,463
Morning.

7
00:00:57,866 --> 00:01:00,667
Morning. Mm.

8
00:01:09,795 --> 00:01:13,144
And when the body
starts to fail...

9
00:01:13,179 --> 00:01:15,742
Medicine takes over.

10
00:01:17,418 --> 00:01:21,177
Morning, kim, sean.
How are you feeling?

11
00:01:21,211 --> 00:01:23,775
Ready.

12
00:01:23,809 --> 00:01:25,518
Today is the day.

13
00:01:25,553 --> 00:01:27,467
How are you doing?

14
00:01:27,502 --> 00:01:29,380
Okay.

15
00:01:29,415 --> 00:01:33,072
Surgeons are arrogant enough
to think...

16
00:01:33,107 --> 00:01:35,157
There's no o we can't save.

17
00:01:35,192 --> 00:01:37,891
Hey, you need a consult?
Uh, kim allan.

18
00:01:37,927 --> 00:01:39,908
She had stage iv
large cell lung cancer.

19
00:01:39,943 --> 00:01:41,959
I removed a second mass
from her right lung

20
00:01:41,994 --> 00:01:44,455
About two months ago,
but her tests had showed that

21
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,600
The cancer had spread to her
lymph nodes and to her liver.

22
00:01:47,635 --> 00:01:50,197
She was readtted last week
with pulmonary edema.

23
00:01:50,233 --> 00:01:52,795
I drained as much fluid
as i could,

24
00:01:52,831 --> 00:01:55,257
But she is still having
a tough time breathing.

25
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:57,957
That's too bad. You gonna
have to intuba her?
She doesn't want that.

26
00:01:57,992 --> 00:01:59,939
You're gonna have to
treat her palliatively.

27
00:01:59,974 --> 00:02:02,126
I don't see what else
we can do for her.

28
00:02:02,162 --> 00:02:04,041
She wants us
to help her die.

29
00:02:04,076 --> 00:02:04,731
Like i said,
dying isn't easy.

30
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:14,082
Since the state requires
two physicians' signatures,

31
00:02:14,117 --> 00:02:16,547
I've asked dr. Hunt
toook over your chart.

32
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:18,020
Okay.

33
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:22,300
Her prognosis says that she has
less than six months to live.

34
00:02:22,335 --> 00:02:25,998
I have informed her
of her treatment options.

35
00:02:26,034 --> 00:02:28,874
She has met with a psychologist
who has determined

36
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,723
That she is mentally fit.

37
00:02:30,758 --> 00:02:34,045
And this can serve
as her second oral request.

38
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,962
Okay.

39
00:02:38,737 --> 00:02:40,962
You have to say it.

40
00:02:40,997 --> 00:02:45,174
Washington state says i have to
hear you ask two times

41
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:47,502
At least 15 days apart.

42
00:02:47,537 --> 00:02:51,028
it's so weird.
It's like i'm applying to die.

43
00:02:51,064 --> 00:02:53,357
Well, if you're having
second thoughts--

44
00:02:53,393 --> 00:02:55,378
You saw how bad
it got last night.

45
00:02:55,412 --> 00:02:57,432
It's just gonna get worse.

46
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:03,288
I would like to end my life

47
00:03:03,323 --> 00:03:06,129
Through
physician-Assisted suicide.

48
00:03:11,267 --> 00:03:13,149
Excuse me. Um...

49
00:03:18,286 --> 00:03:20,682
I-I'm just gonna go see
what up.

50
00:03:20,717 --> 00:03:22,771
Dr. Altman.

51
00:03:22,807 --> 00:03:25,168
How long does it take...

52
00:03:25,203 --> 00:03:28,763
To die...
once i take the barbiturates?

53
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,818
Can we not
talk about this?

54
00:03:30,853 --> 00:03:33,215
It's just, um...

55
00:03:33,251 --> 00:03:35,098
We're not there yet.

56
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:38,763
We are there, sean.

57
00:03:38,798 --> 00:03:41,330
we are.

58
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,638
Kim,
to answer your question...

59
00:03:48,077 --> 00:03:49,994
About 45 minutes.

60
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:53,657
It takes about 45 minutes
to die.

61
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,800
Three dates, no sex.
Just talking.

62
00:03:57,836 --> 00:04:00,951
Do you have any idea how much
you can learn about someone

63
00:04:00,987 --> 00:04:02,457
If you remain upright?

64
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:05,436
Like i'll bet you didn't know
teddy hates the word "moist."

65
00:04:05,472 --> 00:04:08,382
Hates it. Would really prefer
people say "damp."

66
00:04:08,417 --> 00:04:10,231
You hear me?

67
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:12,491
I'm growing again.
I'm, like, grown.

68
00:04:12,526 --> 00:04:14,340
She's making cartilage
from scratch.

69
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:17,422
She's a little preoccupied
these days. It's super hot.

70
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:19,373
Aughs)
i'm gonna be late.

71
00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:20,571
Bye.

72
00:04:23,518 --> 00:04:25,605
She doesn't want kids.

73
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:28,892
Arizona doesn't want kids--
In her womb, in her house, ever.

74
00:04:28,928 --> 00:04:31,495
She told me.
What did you say?

75
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,549
Nothing. I mean,
we're doing so great.

76
00:04:33,585 --> 00:04:35,741
I don't want to ruin it

77
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:38,823
By being the crazy, desperate
girl with the aching womb.
Better than being
the crazy, childless woman

78
00:04:38,858 --> 00:04:40,980
Who sits out at the playground
watching the children pl.

79
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:43,206
They have laws
for people like that.

80
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,705
You gotta tell her.

81
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:49,437
All rit,
so in the third quarter,

82
00:04:49,473 --> 00:04:52,280
The collection rate of medicaid
was what percent again?

83
00:04:52,315 --> 00:04:55,807
Hey. Would you excuse me
one second?

84
00:04:55,842 --> 00:04:58,477
You have 30 seconds.

85
00:04:58,513 --> 00:05:01,730
Okay, so this woman comes in to
the e.R. With abdominal pain.

86
00:05:01,765 --> 00:05:04,333
She's had it off and on
for about six months.
Mm-Hmm.

87
00:05:04,368 --> 00:05:06,353
And a lot of doctors
have told her

88
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:09,093
It's either an ulcer
or gastritis.
All right, get to the point.
You have 15 seconds.

89
00:05:09,128 --> 00:05:11,832
Okay, so it occurs to me that
the nausea is probably caused

90
00:05:11,868 --> 00:05:14,639
By a positional shift--
C.S.F. Okay.
Brain tumor. Got it.

91
00:05:14,675 --> 00:05:16,729
Right, but not just
any brain tumor.

92
00:05:16,764 --> 00:05:19,878
I mean, she's got this huge,
beautiful ependymoma.

93
00:05:19,914 --> 00:05:22,207
So shadow shepherd--
Dr. Nelson.

94
00:05:22,243 --> 00:05:24,194
Okay, shadow shepherd
is going to do

95
00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:26,521
An intraventricular
resection...
mm-Hmm.

96
00:05:26,557 --> 00:05:29,672
And let me assist, and i may
even get to debulk the tumor.
That's it?

97
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:32,617
Okay.
Sorry for the interruption.

98
00:05:32,652 --> 00:05:35,253
So where were we? Percentage,
third quarter of medicaid--

99
00:05:35,288 --> 00:05:37,274
What was the rate of return?

100
00:05:37,309 --> 00:05:39,396
how close?

101
00:05:39,432 --> 00:05:41,691
Two minutes.
It's nicole, right?

102
00:05:41,726 --> 00:05:43,985
Three guys
waiting on an ambulance?

103
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,553
Must be nicole
behind the wheel.
Have you seen her ass?

104
00:05:46,588 --> 00:05:48,744
Man, i'd love to hit that.

105
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,183
Morning, chief.

106
00:05:50,218 --> 00:05:52,579
Sorry about that, chief.
I--

107
00:05:52,615 --> 00:05:55,970
That's quite all right.
And, um, i'm not the chief.

108
00:05:58,744 --> 00:06:00,558
hey, nicole.
Hey.

109
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:04,017
Nick kelsey, 32, injured
skiing off a helicopter.

110
00:06:04,052 --> 00:06:07,406
Vital signs are stable.
It wasn't the helicoer
that did it.

111
00:06:07,442 --> 00:06:09,461
It was the avalanche.
Idiotic either way.

112
00:06:09,497 --> 00:06:11,481
He's got two idiot friends
coming in behind him,

113
00:06:11,516 --> 00:06:13,570
But he's got
the worst of it--

114
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:17,816
Open fracture to the left tibia
and left hip fracture.

115
00:06:19,872 --> 00:06:23,227
What areou looking at,
chachi?

116
00:06:23,262 --> 00:06:26,206
(Woman speaking indistinctly
over p.A.)

117
00:06:26,241 --> 00:06:29,321
Whatappened? We were
in the middle of a consult.

118
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:32,335
You're her doctor. You shouldn't
be pushing her to do that.

119
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,937
I offered her options.
I told her about hospice.

120
00:06:34,972 --> 00:06:36,992
She doesn't want to die
a slow death

121
00:06:37,026 --> 00:06:38,806
Hooked up to machines

122
00:06:38,842 --> 00:06:41,615
Or be so heavilyedated,
she might as well be dead.

123
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,634
And i have to say,
i don't blame her.

124
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,751
This is an act of mercy.
Oh, "an act of mercy"?
You are killing her.

125
00:06:46,786 --> 00:06:48,702
Just so that you are clear,

126
00:06:48,738 --> 00:06:51,716
By writing that prescrtion,
you are killing that woman.

127
00:06:51,751 --> 00:06:53,942
All right, then.

128
00:06:53,977 --> 00:06:56,476
I'll find someone else.

129
00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:08,494
Watch it. Watch it.
Heads up!

130
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:11,542
You need to work on
your passing game, hunt...
oh, yeah?

131
00:07:11,577 --> 00:07:13,527
You ball hog.
Well, you need

00:07:13,563 --> 00:07:16,747

135
00:07:22,226 --> 00:07:24,725

136
00:07:27,328 --> 00:07:29,930
Whoo-Hoo-Hoo!
Yeah...

137
00:07:29,965 --> 00:07:32,840
Okay, break it up, break it up.
Break it up, you two.

138
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:35,683
We're only down by 3.
Oh, yeah, 'cause you suck.

139
00:07:35,718 --> 00:07:37,600
insubordinate.
Oh, sir,ou suck, sir.

140
00:07:37,635 --> 00:07:40,648
I mean, dan. Come on, it's true.
You play like my grandma.
Whatever.

141
00:07:52,428 --> 00:07:55,954
Get your battle rattle.
It's time to go to work.

142
00:08:05,577 --> 00:08:07,431
Owen, come on.

143
00:08:26,461 --> 00:08:28,306
I need to reduce
this ankle dislocation.

144
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,622
Give him 10 of morphine.
I need to treat
his frostbite.

145
00:08:30,657 --> 00:08:33,073
Nick, you like
the tips of your fingers?
Yes, please.

146
00:08:33,107 --> 00:08:35,993
You jumped out
of a helicopter on skis?
Yeah. You can't get powder
like that anywhere else.

147
00:08:36,027 --> 00:08:38,008
I'm seeing fluid
around your kidney.

148
00:08:38,042 --> 00:08:40,961
We're gonna need to do
a c.T. Of your abdomen.
Do what you gotta do.

149
00:08:40,996 --> 00:08:43,010
Me and the guys
are running with the bulls

150
00:08:43,044 --> 00:08:46,265
In pamplona next year.
Gotta be up on my feet.

151
00:08:50,161 --> 00:08:51,871
Hey, phil!

152
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:54,389
Tell those doctors
they need to fix you up

153
00:08:56,706 --> 00:09:00,733
You're an active guy.
With the bulls next year.
Once a year anyhow.
Better tn thing.

154
00:09:00,768 --> 00:09:03,755
Once a year, we live like men.
You almost died like men.

155
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:07,850
On my count.
One, two... three.

156
00:09:07,884 --> 00:09:10,570
big ass car bomb
waxed half their unit.

157
00:09:10,604 --> 00:09:12,584
They tried to evac,

158
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:15,638
But it turned into
an insurgent firefight.
G.S.W. To the abdomen.

159
00:09:15,672 --> 00:09:18,290
Let's stabilize him
till we get him to an o.R.

160
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:21,311
Get me some wet bandages
and an occlusive dressing.
All ouof those!

161
00:09:21,346 --> 00:09:24,802
okay, uh, some wet towels
and, uh...

162
00:09:24,836 --> 00:09:27,487
That.

163
00:09:27,523 --> 00:09:29,905
We'll close him with this.

164
00:09:29,939 --> 00:09:32,959
Gekko, give me that roll
of 2-Inch tape.

165
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:40,546
I need a laryngoscope, an e.T.
Tube. I need to intubate.

166
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,064
Okay, finish this.
yes, sir.
I'm on it.

167
00:09:43,098 --> 00:09:45,145
pupils fixed and dilated.

168
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,200
He's way past go.
Who's next?
over here, sir.

169
00:09:48,235 --> 00:09:49,946
Colonel mooney, sir.
Sandstorm's coming.

170
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,497
Command's ordered us
to move back.
You're kidding me. When?

171
00:09:52,531 --> 00:09:54,107
Now, sir.

172
00:09:54,143 --> 00:09:56,626
All right.
People, secure your patients.

173
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,378
I almost have
my guy stabilized.
You'll ride with him
on the medevac.

174
00:09:59,412 --> 00:10:01,930
Take my amputation
and the head trauma, too.

175
00:10:01,964 --> 00:10:04,481
Hunt, we'll take your g.S.W.
In the a.P.C.

176
00:10:04,515 --> 00:10:07,334
Let's move.
You want me to go?

177
00:10:07,369 --> 00:10:09,851
No, i'm fine.
You hate helicopters.

178
00:10:09,887 --> 00:10:12,202
I know. I'm fine.

179
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:14,148
I'll see you back there.

180
00:10:14,182 --> 00:10:16,095
See you back there.

181
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:20,326
shall we scan him first?

182
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,936
(Man speaking indistinctly
over p.A.)

183
00:10:21,971 --> 00:10:24,689
see what kind
of damage we're dealing with

184
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,637
In case we need an o.R.?

185
00:10:26,671 --> 00:10:28,650
He's got
some abdominal bruising.

186
00:10:28,684 --> 00:10:31,537
Yeah, yeah, okay.
You--You take .

187
00:10:31,572 --> 00:10:33,920
Uh, get him up to c.T.
right away, doctor.

188
00:10:33,954 --> 00:10:37,848
Hey, how come you didn't
get hurt in the avalanche?
Oh, i never got off
the helicopter.

189
00:10:37,882 --> 00:10:40,937
I was about toump
when the avalanche started.

190
00:10:40,971 --> 00:10:43,051
You missed it, tommy.
It was friggin' awesome.

191
00:10:43,085 --> 00:10:45,871
yeah, tommy,
friggin' awesome!

192
00:10:45,905 --> 00:10:47,852
Yeah, tommy.
Friggin' awe.

193
00:10:49,464 --> 00:10:52,652
Uh, dr. Altman
said you requested

194
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:54,566
To lower your pain meds.

195
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,950
They make me fuzzy.

196
00:10:56,984 --> 00:10:58,996
I don't want
to be fuzzy today.

197
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,977
Did she tell you?

198
00:11:01,011 --> 00:11:03,595
That you're going home?
Yeah.

199
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,811
Oh, i changed my mind.
What?

200
00:11:05,846 --> 00:11:08,496
No, no, not about...
i just...

201
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:11,551
I want to do it here...
in the hospital.

202
00:11:11,585 --> 00:11:14,404
I don't want sean to have to
deal with my body afterwards.

203
00:11:14,439 --> 00:11:15,948
Don't worry
about that stuff.

204
00:11:15,983 --> 00:11:18,332
We can make this place
like home, you know?

205
00:11:18,367 --> 00:11:20,514
Get rid of all these machines

206
00:11:20,548 --> 00:11:23,299
And... get some of
our stuff--

207
00:11:23,335 --> 00:11:26,724
My quilt, some pictures...
mm-Hmm.

208
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:29,108
Some wine.

209
00:11:29,142 --> 00:11:30,718
Can we have wine?

210
00:11:30,753 --> 00:11:33,371
I don't see why not.

211
00:11:33,406 --> 00:11:35,251
If you need wine...
i don't.

212
00:11:35,285 --> 00:11:38,473
Then maybe you don't
really want--
I don't need wine.
I want the wine.

213
00:11:38,508 --> 00:11:41,226
But i think
you're gonna need it.

214
00:11:41,261 --> 00:11:43,543
You seem scared.

215
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:47,100
Are you scared?

216
00:11:47,135 --> 00:11:50,424
Stoporing about me.
All these things
are happening,

217
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:53,076
And i'm making
all these choices,

218
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,661
And i have no idea
how you're feeling.

219
00:11:55,695 --> 00:11:57,775
I'm not feeling anything.

220
00:11:57,809 --> 00:12:00,259
Sean, i'm talking about
where i'm gonna die.

221
00:12:00,294 --> 00:12:02,408
You have to be
feeling something.

222
00:12:06,873 --> 00:12:09,357
I'll go home
and get the stuff, all right?

223
00:12:09,391 --> 00:12:10,598
Sean.

224
00:12:12,445 --> 00:12:14,594
Red or white?

225
00:12:14,628 --> 00:12:16,809
red.

226
00:12:18,522 --> 00:12:21,206
In a wine glass,
not a plastic cup.

227
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,153
Okay.

228
00:12:26,075 --> 00:12:27,819
It never changes.

229
00:12:27,854 --> 00:12:31,142
You have the same fights.

230
00:12:31,178 --> 00:12:34,801
I mean, even when you're dying,
you have the same fits.

231
00:12:34,836 --> 00:12:36,782
You want to know
how they're feeling,

232
00:12:36,817 --> 00:12:38,829
And they don't want
to tell you.

233
00:12:38,864 --> 00:12:40,542
sorry. I'm--

234
00:12:40,577 --> 00:12:42,154
Don't be.

235
00:12:44,706 --> 00:12:46,685
I think they don't know.

236
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,967
You know, when you ask them
how they're feeling,

237
00:12:49,003 --> 00:12:51,016
And they don't want
to tell you,

238
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:53,600
And you think
they're being difficult?

239
00:12:53,634 --> 00:12:56,588
I think
they really don't know.

240
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,777
Relax.

241
00:13:02,094 --> 00:13:04,946
Deep bredeep breaths.
Good.

242
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:11,223
(Woman speaking indistinctly
over p.A.)

243
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:13,272
Where do you stand on
physicians'-Assisted suicide?

244
00:13:13,306 --> 00:13:15,621
Well, i'm not opposed to it.
Good.

245
00:13:15,657 --> 00:13:18,407
And as long as we're talking
about the controversial stuff,

246
00:13:18,442 --> 00:13:20,287
Let's get something straight--

247
00:13:20,322 --> 00:13:22,268
Arena football
is not real football.

248
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:25,256
Obviously--
Mark, mark, wait. This is not
me getting to know you.

249
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:28,210
This is... i have a patient
who's terminal.

250
00:13:28,244 --> 00:13:30,693
She wants to die
and she wants my help,

251
00:13:30,728 --> 00:13:33,245
And i want yours.

252
00:13:37,207 --> 00:13:38,683
See that?

253
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:39,993
The tur's pressing down

254
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,006
On the floor
of the fourth ventricle,

255
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,256
Which is causing the nausea.
So you debulk the tumor,

256
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,269
And then you move on
to the stalk--

257
00:13:46,303 --> 00:13:48,485
No. You debulk the tumor.

258
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,936
dr. Shepherd
has requested these scans.

259
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,380
His schedule has freed up.

260
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,595
He's decided to do
the resection himself.

261
00:13:54,629 --> 00:13:56,945
Oh, no! Th's my--
I am debulking. It's my tumor.

262
00:13:56,979 --> 00:13:58,791
It's dr. Shepherd's tumor now.

263
00:14:09,601 --> 00:14:11,581
Dr. Hunt,
can i help you?

264
00:14:11,615 --> 00:14:13,762
Uh, no. No, no,
i got it.

265
00:14:21,284 --> 00:14:24,404
Oscar-4-Kilo,
this is echo-5-Gulf.

266
00:14:24,439 --> 00:14:28,164
Oscar-4-Kilo,
this is echo-5-Gulf.

267
00:14:28,198 --> 00:14:30,144
Anything, sergeant?
No, sir.

268
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:33,367
I think it's the storm.
Yeah, well, they know
we're coming, right?

269
00:14:33,401 --> 00:14:35,648
All right.

270
00:14:35,684 --> 00:14:38,973
Where are we going?
Green zone, baby.

271
00:14:39,007 --> 00:14:40,450
They'll stabilize you,

272
00:14:40,484 --> 00:14:43,974
Then you are going
to a hospital in germany.

273
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:47,365
And then you're gonna go home.
Okay?

274
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,581
Teddy get there yet?

275
00:14:49,615 --> 00:14:52,400
No word.

276
00:14:52,435 --> 00:14:55,254
Don't worry. I'm sure
your girl's just fine.

277
00:14:55,288 --> 00:14:58,937
Stop it. I am serious.
We're friends.
yeah,
keep telling yourself that.

278
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,435
hunt?!

279
00:15:25,471 --> 00:15:28,069
You all right, hunt?!

280
00:15:28,138 --> 00:15:30,908
I'm okay. You okay?

281
00:15:30,943 --> 00:15:32,344
Yeah.

282
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,910
We must have hit an i.E.D.

283
00:15:34,945 --> 00:15:37,201
How are the patients?

284
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:39,219
I don't know.

285
00:15:39,254 --> 00:15:41,955
I gotta find 'em all.

286
00:15:59,571 --> 00:15:59,605
everyone's gone. We lost gekko.

287
00:16:04,052 --> 00:16:05,932
Dan?

288
00:16:05,967 --> 00:16:08,052
Dan.

289
00:16:10,893 --> 00:16:13,833
owen?

290
00:16:13,868 --> 00:16:17,014
Owen?

291
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,211
Owen?

292
00:16:18,246 --> 00:16:19,374
What?

293
00:16:19,409 --> 00:16:22,418
You paged.

294
00:16:22,454 --> 00:16:25,120
When you did
kim allan's evaluation,

295
00:16:25,155 --> 00:16:28,164
Did you scope her?
What? Wait.
Is that her chart?

296
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:30,079
Dr. Altman's patient, who,
according to this chart,

297
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:32,576
You ordered pulmonary
function tests one week ago.

298
00:16:32,611 --> 00:16:34,697
I'd like to know if,
during that evaluation,

299
00:16:34,732 --> 00:16:36,612
You did a bronchoscopy.
Is there a problem?

300
00:16:36,648 --> 00:16:39,519
Can you just answer
the question?
Why are you interrogatg me?

301
00:16:39,555 --> 00:16:41,538
P.F.T.S can give you
false positives,

302
00:16:41,572 --> 00:16:44,308
And a patient may kill herself
due to incorrect data.
Well, it's routine,
so we probably did--

303
00:16:44,343 --> 00:16:46,908
Probably? Probably
is good enough for?

304
00:16:46,943 --> 00:16:48,858
Probably is good enough
for dr. Altman?

305
00:16:48,893 --> 00:16:52,791
What is going on?
Are...

306
00:16:52,826 --> 00:16:55,561
Owen.

307
00:16:55,596 --> 00:16:57,476
did you call lani?

308
00:16:57,511 --> 00:16:59,631
Um, you should call
your wife.

309
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:03,975
She'll freak. Tommy, call when
i go in. Downplay it.

310
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,719
It's a broken leg.

311
00:17:05,755 --> 00:17:08,319
A little frostbite on your
fingers, but nothing terrible.

312
00:17:08,355 --> 00:17:10,337
You're about to...
aah!

313
00:17:10,372 --> 00:17:12,116
Um,
scream really loud.

314
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:15,399
that was worse than when
i broke my ankle on kilimanjaro.

315
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:17,451
You guys
climbed kilimanjaro?
Couple of years ago.

316
00:17:17,486 --> 00:17:20,393
I made it to the summit while
these guys got altitude sickness

317
00:17:20,428 --> 00:17:22,993
Half a mile from the top.
man.
You guys are hard-Core.

318
00:17:23,028 --> 00:17:25,215
We gotta be.
I sell insurance.

319
00:17:25,251 --> 00:17:27,746
Phil and tommy
are accountants.

320
00:17:27,782 --> 00:17:31,235
Ah! These trips are all we got
to keep our blood moving.

321
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,424
Y, show 'em the picture
of you on top of kili

322
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,374
With the rubber chicken.

323
00:17:35,409 --> 00:17:38,178
That doesn't look like
you on a mountain.

324
00:17:38,214 --> 00:17:40,813
Oh, sorry.
That's my daughter hannah.

325
00:17:40,847 --> 00:17:43,548
Ladybug for halloween.

326
00:17:46,252 --> 00:17:50,286
You telling me
you don't want one of those?

327
00:17:54,392 --> 00:17:56,819
You stole my surgery
right out from under me.

328
00:17:56,855 --> 00:17:58,974
It wasn't your surgery.
It was nelson's surgery.

329
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,855
It's beyond nelson's
skill level.

330
00:18:00,891 --> 00:18:05,370
Right? I mean,
that's what you said--
My diagnosis,
my tumor, my debulking.

331
00:18:05,405 --> 00:18:08,277
Can i scrub in at least?
You're on nelson's service.

332
00:18:08,312 --> 00:18:11,390
If i switch you, it's gonna
look like favoritism.
Dr. Nelson's been given
an aneurysm--

333
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:15,255
You stop talking.
meredith, calm down.
People are starting to stare.

334
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:16,829
You stole my surgery.

335
00:18:18,744 --> 00:18:21,514
He stole my surgery.

336
00:18:24,012 --> 00:18:25,550
Everything okay?

337
00:18:25,586 --> 00:18:29,449
Yeah, it's fine.
Everything's, uh... fine.

338
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:33,246
Have you had lunch yet today?
I'm headed down.

339
00:18:33,281 --> 00:18:35,606
Oh, i can't eat
in the cafeteria anymore.

340
00:18:35,641 --> 00:18:38,137
The vultures
won't leave me alone.
Vultures?

341
00:18:38,172 --> 00:18:39,470
People need things from me.

342
00:18:39,506 --> 00:18:42,036
Seems like everybody
has a pressing problem

343
00:18:42,071 --> 00:18:44,055
That can't wait.
Shepherd, you have a minute?

344
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:45,627
Mm-Hmm. See?

345
00:18:49,117 --> 00:18:52,126
Ugh. My lunch
is making me s,

346
00:18:52,161 --> 00:18:54,418
And i haven't even
started eating it yet.

347
00:18:54,453 --> 00:18:56,846
say something.
shut up.

348
00:18:56,881 --> 00:18:59,069
I was gonna go
for lasagna.

349
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:01,601
I don't know why
i didn't pull the trigger.
Say it.

350
00:19:01,636 --> 00:19:04,097
Shut up.
Say what?

351
00:19:04,133 --> 00:19:06,834
nothing.
Hello.

352
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,300
Okay, then.

353
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:26,227
If you don't say it,

354
00:19:26,262 --> 00:19:29,716
You're gonna regret it
for a long, long--
enough.

355
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,110
Okay, what is it
with you two?

356
00:19:32,145 --> 00:19:33,991
What is your problem?

357
00:19:34,026 --> 00:19:36,077
Teddy, i--
You go to shepherd
behind my back

358
00:19:36,113 --> 00:19:38,198
About a patient
you don't even know?

359
00:19:38,233 --> 00:19:41,379
You have no idea
what she's been dealing with,

360
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:44,423
The kind of pain that she's in--
Pain that's only gonna be worse

361
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,988
After i ram a tube
down her throat

362
00:19:47,024 --> 00:19:49,040
Because you're having
some kind of problem

363
00:19:49,076 --> 00:19:51,366
With her exercising
her legal right to die.

364
00:19:51,401 --> 00:19:55,163
So i want to know,
what the hell is your problem?

365
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,231
You missed it.

366
00:20:18,266 --> 00:20:20,661
Altman tore hunt a new one
in the cafeteria.

367
00:20:20,696 --> 00:20:23,091
Whole hospital's
talking about it.
Oh, not to me.

368
00:20:23,126 --> 00:20:25,007
I walk in the room,

369
00:20:25,043 --> 00:20:28,533
And all conversation
grinds to a halt.

370
00:20:28,569 --> 00:20:30,039
Well, come on.

371
00:20:30,075 --> 00:20:33,222
You don't talk locker room talk
in front of the coach.

372
00:20:33,258 --> 00:20:35,173
I'm not a coach anymore.

373
00:20:35,209 --> 00:20:38,767
I'm a player. I take a shower
like everybody else.

374
00:20:41,232 --> 00:20:42,977
Richard...

375
00:20:43,012 --> 00:20:45,613
You're a little bit
like everybody else.

376
00:20:45,648 --> 00:20:47,769
But mostly,
you're still a coach.

377
00:20:47,805 --> 00:20:50,268
It's a sign of respect.

378
00:20:50,302 --> 00:20:53,896
It would be wrong
toake it any other way.

379
00:20:57,902 --> 00:20:59,852
You know the drill--

380
00:20:59,886 --> 00:21:01,973
We've put you
in a twilight state,

381
00:21:02,009 --> 00:21:04,677
Next we're gonna spray lidocaine
on the back of your throat

382
00:21:04,713 --> 00:21:07,313
And pass the scope--
I don't get it.
She had this test last week.

383
00:21:07,348 --> 00:21:10,154
Isis there a chance
the results are wrong?
It's very unlikely.

384
00:21:10,189 --> 00:21:12,071
But it's possible?

385
00:21:12,106 --> 00:21:15,116
You wouldn't put her thrgh
this again for no reason.

386
00:21:15,152 --> 00:21:18,094
You must think that there's
a chance the tests were wrong.

387
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:22,065
There are questions being raised
that have nothing to do with--
By who? Raised by who?

388
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:25,213
Sean--
Just talk to me,
'cause i'm standing here

389
00:21:25,249 --> 00:21:27,850
Thinking that my wife's
gonna die today,

390
00:21:27,884 --> 00:21:30,245
And if that's not gonna happen,
all right,

391
00:21:30,281 --> 00:21:33,770
If there's a chance
that she might get better--
your wife
isn't gonna get better.

392
00:21:33,805 --> 00:21:35,688
This test is unnecessary,

393
00:21:35,723 --> 00:21:38,562
And the hospital's
covering its ass.

394
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,618
thank you.

395
00:21:49,653 --> 00:21:52,185
no problem.

396
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,307
Julie...

397
00:21:54,342 --> 00:21:57,456
Can you find out
if dr. Bailey's on her way?

398
00:21:57,491 --> 00:22:00,570
Okay, doctor.

399
00:22:02,215 --> 00:22:04,815
if i wasn't
happily married,

400
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:06,560
I'd hit her.

401
00:22:08,512 --> 00:22:11,968
I'd hit her ha.

402
00:22:15,256 --> 00:22:17,752
Sir, i think
what you wanted  say

403
00:22:17,788 --> 00:22:19,944
Was "hit that."

404
00:22:19,978 --> 00:22:24,564
I don't thk you wanted
to say that at all.

405
00:22:35,962 --> 00:22:38,050
I hear shepherd
took your surgery.

406
00:22:38,085 --> 00:22:40,616
How'd you hear that?

407
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:42,465
Appantly you yell
really loud.

408
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,443
Yeah, well, i have to hold
a retractor for shadow shepherd

409
00:22:45,513 --> 00:22:47,394
While derek
debulks my tumor.

410
00:22:47,429 --> 00:22:49,379
So, yes, i yell very loud.

411
00:22:49,414 --> 00:22:51,843
Yeah, well, the key
is to think of yourself

412
00:22:51,879 --> 00:22:54,103
As one of the whos
down in whoville.

413
00:22:54,137 --> 00:22:56,087
What?

414
00:22:56,122 --> 00:22:58,038
You know, when, um,

415
00:22:58,073 --> 00:23:00,981
The grinch came down
and stole all their presents...

416
00:23:01,017 --> 00:23:03,206
They didn't lethat
ruin christmas for them.

417
00:23:03,242 --> 00:23:06,184
You know, instead, they came out
on christmas morning

418
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:09,231
And they sang.

419
00:23:09,266 --> 00:23:11,216
You're gonna
go into that surgery,

420
00:23:11,251 --> 00:23:13,646
And you're gonna sing.

421
00:23:15,222 --> 00:23:18,096
Sing, cindy lou.

422
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:19,567
Sing.

423
00:23:22,648 --> 00:23:25,215
Your scalp lac is small enough

424
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:28,159
That shooting in lidocaine
would be more painful

425
00:23:28,194 --> 00:23:31,650
Than just throwing in
a couple of staples.
Is this gonna hurt
like my fingers? Because--

426
00:23:31,685 --> 00:23:33,669
Not too much.

427
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:36,681
Aah! God! aah!

428
00:23:36,716 --> 00:23:38,940
Aah!
Sorry, sorry.

429
00:23:38,975 --> 00:23:40,138
Aah!

430
00:23:40,139 --> 00:23:41,918
Okay, that's it.
I got it.

431
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:44,211
the hand
aawas swelling so much,

432
00:23:44,246 --> 00:23:46,949
It would've popped the finger
right off.

433
00:23:46,984 --> 00:23:49,174
what?

434
00:23:49,209 --> 00:23:51,091
You're still trying
to save the arm.

435
00:23:51,126 --> 00:23:53,863
You gotta tourniquet it.
If i do,
then you will lose it.

436
00:23:53,898 --> 00:23:55,848
it's not about the arm.

437
00:23:55,884 --> 00:23:58,963
If i could just try to tie off
that brachial artery--

438
00:23:58,998 --> 00:24:02,386
Owen!
It's not about the arm.

439
00:24:02,421 --> 00:24:05,774
You're right. I know.
I know. You're right.

440
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:08,101
Okay, dan, listen to me.

441
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,285
The back of this truck
is trashed.

442
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,954
Most of the supplies,
all the morphine--

443
00:24:13,989 --> 00:24:16,761
There's no morphine.
There's no lidocaine.

444
00:24:16,797 --> 00:24:18,369
You bring whiskey?

445
00:24:23,608 --> 00:24:25,831
Okay, we got it.
We got it.

446
00:24:25,867 --> 00:24:29,049
we got it. We got it.
We got it.

447
00:24:29,084 --> 00:24:31,479
No.

448
00:24:31,514 --> 00:24:33,385
I don't think we do.

449
00:24:47,794 --> 00:24:51,217
dr. Hunt.

450
00:24:51,252 --> 00:24:52,963
Kim allan's bronchoscopy

451
00:24:52,998 --> 00:24:55,154
Confirmed that nothing more
could be done.

452
00:24:55,188 --> 00:24:56,626
Sloan signed off.

453
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:59,056
He did his due diligence,
but it's over.

454
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:05,116
I won't let you kill him.L him.

455
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:07,136
You're not gonna kill him.

456
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:11,107
Dr. Hunt... the patient
in question is a woman.

457
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:14,496
No one's trying to kill her.

458
00:25:14,532 --> 00:25:16,379
She's choosing to die.

459
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:21,239
You should go home.

460
00:25:21,275 --> 00:25:22,678
I have a surgery.

461
00:25:22,713 --> 00:25:26,512
You're done for the day.
Go home.

462
00:25:31,956 --> 00:25:34,729
Okay, okay.

463
00:25:34,764 --> 00:25:36,578
Can you--

464
00:25:36,613 --> 00:25:38,632
Can you hold this?
I c--

465
00:25:38,667 --> 00:25:42,021
Can you put pressure there?
I don't think--

466
00:25:42,056 --> 00:25:45,889
Okay, i'm gonna have to
move you--
Oh, no, i can't. I can't.
I'm too tired.

467
00:25:45,925 --> 00:25:48,833
No, no, no. Dan, dan,
wake up. Wake up.

468
00:25:48,868 --> 00:25:50,339
I have to.

469
00:25:50,374 --> 00:25:51,845
It's gonna hurt like hell,

470
00:25:51,881 --> 00:25:54,790
But i have to find something
to pack this wound

471
00:25:54,825 --> 00:25:56,776
Till someone comes.

472
00:25:56,811 --> 00:25:58,932
Someone's coming?
Someone's coming?

473
00:25:58,967 --> 00:26:01,191
Okay, you ready?

474
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:02,732
Here we go.

475
00:26:02,767 --> 00:26:04,649
Here we go.

476
00:26:04,685 --> 00:26:07,217
okay, here we go.

477
00:26:07,251 --> 00:26:08,963
Here we go.
Aah!

478
00:26:08,998 --> 00:26:10,503
Oh, please, please!

479
00:26:10,538 --> 00:26:12,044
Please!

480
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:14,953
please. Please.
Please. Please.

481
00:26:14,989 --> 00:26:17,350
Please. Please.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

482
00:26:17,386 --> 00:26:19,815
Please just... don't.
I'm sorry.

483
00:26:21,733 --> 00:26:25,224
There we go. There we go.

484
00:26:25,259 --> 00:26:28,716
Hypoermia--
Uh, that's the last one.

485
00:26:28,751 --> 00:26:30,427
The last...

486
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:33,782
Stop that.
Someone is coming.

487
00:26:33,818 --> 00:26:36,179
Help is coming.

488
00:26:36,214 --> 00:26:39,124
You been saying that
for hours.

489
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:41,964
i'm coagulopathic.

490
00:26:41,999 --> 00:26:44,362
I'm probably acidotic.

491
00:26:44,397 --> 00:26:46,586
I'm in the triad of death.

492
00:26:48,128 --> 00:26:49,976
No one is coming.

493
00:26:50,011 --> 00:26:52,543
If i could just move you--
No! Look, hunt, i need you--

494
00:26:52,579 --> 00:26:55,659
I need you to say
a hail mary with me.

495
00:26:55,694 --> 00:26:58,807
Dan...

496
00:26:58,843 --> 00:27:00,587
I don't know it.

497
00:27:00,623 --> 00:27:02,060
That's okay.

498
00:27:02,096 --> 00:27:04,867
It's okay.
Just say it with me.

499
00:27:08,154 --> 00:27:10,927
Hail mary...
hail mary...

500
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,392
Full of grace...
full of grace...

501
00:27:13,427 --> 00:27:15,891
The lord is with thee.
The lord is with thee.

502
00:27:15,927 --> 00:27:18,527
Blessed art thou
amongst women...
blessed art thou
amongst women...

503
00:27:18,562 --> 00:27:22,155
Blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, jesus.
Blessed is the fruit
of thy wb, jesus.

504
00:27:22,225 --> 00:27:24,346
Holy mary, mother of god...
holy mary, mother of god...

505
00:27:24,381 --> 00:27:26,298
Pray for us sinners...
pray for us sinners...

506
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:27,907
Now...
now...

507
00:27:27,941 --> 00:27:30,338
And at the hour
of our death.
And at the hour
of our death.

508
00:27:30,373 --> 00:27:32,906
Amen.
Amen.

509
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:36,602
You make sure lisa
gets my ring, all right?

510
00:27:36,638 --> 00:27:38,006
Don't give up, dan.

511
00:27:38,042 --> 00:27:41,669
Don't--Don't use it to propose
to altman or something.

512
00:27:43,177 --> 00:27:45,298
But you--You should propose
to altman.

513
00:27:45,334 --> 00:27:48,653
you know, you two,
you should--You should...

514
00:27:48,723 --> 00:27:50,707
Shut up, dan.
I'm engaged to beth.

515
00:27:50,743 --> 00:27:54,747
And you, you are gonna give
that ring to lisa, okay?

516
00:27:54,782 --> 00:27:58,101
come on. Come on.

517
00:27:58,137 --> 00:27:59,609
What? No.

518
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:01,114
move your hand.

519
00:28:01,149 --> 00:28:02,278
No.

520
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:03,887
That's an order, soldier.

521
00:28:03,923 --> 00:28:05,838
No, sir.

522
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:21,278
They're working
on nick's kidney.

523
00:28:21,313 --> 00:28:23,881
Uh, i was able
to stabilize his legs,

524
00:28:23,916 --> 00:28:27,475
But it's gonna be
a long recovery process.

525
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:29,495
You may need
to let his wife know

526
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:32,540
It's a little bit more
than a broken leg.
Yeah, i told my wife,
and she's calling lani.

527
00:28:32,576 --> 00:28:34,972
My wife
can handle her better.

528
00:28:35,008 --> 00:28:37,026
so you--
You summited kili,

529
00:28:37,062 --> 00:28:38,464
You run with the bulls,

530
00:28:38,499 --> 00:28:41,612
But you're--You're scared
of your friend's wife.

531
00:28:41,648 --> 00:28:43,702
I was scared on kili.

532
00:28:43,737 --> 00:28:45,893
I hated every minute of it.

533
00:28:45,928 --> 00:28:47,570
So why do it?

534
00:28:47,606 --> 00:28:49,659
Nick and phil.
They're my boys.

535
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:51,781
And they love adventure.

536
00:28:51,816 --> 00:28:53,801
Me? I got a kid...

537
00:28:53,836 --> 00:28:56,677
And bad knees.

538
00:28:56,712 --> 00:28:59,757
But i can't ruin it.
We're a team, you know?

539
00:28:59,792 --> 00:29:02,291
So you just suck it up, huh?

540
00:29:02,326 --> 00:29:04,688
Close my eyes
and hope i don't die.

541
00:29:07,564 --> 00:29:10,028
I can't actually
give you the drugs,

542
00:29:10,063 --> 00:29:12,697
But you can have
this prescription filled

543
00:29:12,733 --> 00:29:14,307
In the hospital pharmacy.

544
00:29:14,342 --> 00:29:19,340
Again, i want to emphasize,
there are other options.

545
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:21,085
We can
make you comfortable.

546
00:29:21,121 --> 00:29:23,105
I just he e queson.

547
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:26,084
Owen, no--
What if they find a cure?

548
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:29,713
I know that it's a long shot,
but isn't saving your life

549
00:29:29,748 --> 00:29:32,896
Worth gambling
on a long shot?
Dr. Hunt, i will call security
if you do not step--

550
00:29:32,931 --> 00:29:37,108
Let--Let her answer.
I'd like to hear the answer.

551
00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:42,379
Maybe...

552
00:29:42,415 --> 00:29:45,255
You have to be dying
to understand.

553
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:48,336
But there's
this thing that happens...

554
00:29:48,371 --> 00:29:53,128
where death stops being scary.

555
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:59,462
What starts being scary
is hope...

556
00:29:59,498 --> 00:30:02,098
'Cause it's not true.

557
00:30:06,276 --> 00:30:10,349
Even if they found
a cure for cancer tomorrow...

558
00:30:10,384 --> 00:30:13,875
It's too late for me.

559
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:16,340
and hanging on to hope,

560
00:30:16,374 --> 00:30:19,113
It may make you feel better...

561
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:26,610
But it just
makes me feel alone.

562
00:30:32,739 --> 00:30:37,325
I don't want to die alone.

563
00:30:37,361 --> 00:30:41,058
Okay?

564
00:30:46,432 --> 00:30:50,335
I am not afraid of this.

565
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:52,252
Why are you?

566
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:57,760
Why are you so afraid
to let me die?

567
00:31:19,074 --> 00:31:22,242
Dr. Hunt.

568
00:31:22,277 --> 00:31:26,202
The pharmacy wouldn't take
my insurance card.

569
00:31:26,237 --> 00:31:28,510
There was some problem.

570
00:31:28,545 --> 00:31:31,575
So i had to go
to a cash machine.

571
00:31:31,611 --> 00:31:35,019
And, uh, i'm running around--
I'm trying to get enough cash

572
00:31:35,054 --> 00:31:38,118
To buy the pills
that are gonna kill my wife.

573
00:31:40,978 --> 00:31:44,111
Anyway...

574
00:31:44,146 --> 00:31:46,142
Here they are.

575
00:32:02,882 --> 00:32:04,569
There'll be a moment...

576
00:32:06,877 --> 00:32:11,147
When she dies,
her face will relax and...

577
00:32:11,182 --> 00:32:14,142
All that pain that she was in,
it'll be gone.

578
00:32:16,899 --> 00:32:20,824
And you will feel relief...

579
00:32:20,859 --> 00:32:23,097
Relief for her,
relief for you.

580
00:32:23,132 --> 00:32:27,849
And you will know
with absolute certainty...

581
00:32:27,885 --> 00:32:30,467
That you did the right thing.

582
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:37,493
Just for a moment...

583
00:32:40,008 --> 00:32:42,797
You gotta let me go, hunt.
Okay?

584
00:32:42,832 --> 00:32:45,483
You gotta let me go.
Please. It hurts.

585
00:32:45,518 --> 00:32:47,583
It hurts.

586
00:32:47,619 --> 00:32:49,788
Oh, please.
It's okay. It's okay.

587
00:32:49,823 --> 00:32:52,612
It's okay. Look at me.

588
00:32:52,647 --> 00:32:54,781
Okay, you gotta do it.

589
00:32:54,816 --> 00:32:58,053
You gotta do it.
I can't make you do it.

590
00:32:58,088 --> 00:33:00,120
Okay? Oh, jeez, it hurts.

591
00:33:00,155 --> 00:33:04,218
It hurts.
It hurts. It'skay.

592
00:33:04,254 --> 00:33:07,524
It's okay. It's okay.

593
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,554
Okay? You gotta do it.

594
00:33:13,518 --> 00:33:17,236
it's okay.

595
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:36,454
You have to hold on
to that moment,

596
00:33:36,489 --> 00:33:39,278
Because all the rest of it...

597
00:33:39,348 --> 00:33:41,551
Is just your own garbage.

598
00:33:50,885 --> 00:33:52,985
you'll be
in physical therapy

599
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,466
For six months,

600
00:33:54,501 --> 00:33:57,806
But with luck, uh, you'll be
ready for your trip next year.

601
00:33:57,841 --> 00:33:59,460
Pamplona, baby!

602
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:01,044
Pamplona!

603
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:02,869
Pamplona.

604
00:34:02,904 --> 00:34:05,935
Oh, come on.

605
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:07,966
He hates this stuff.

606
00:34:08,002 --> 00:34:09,413
All right, the adrenaline,

607
00:34:09,448 --> 00:34:12,547
The adventure--He--
He does this just for you guys,

608
00:34:12,582 --> 00:34:15,509
Because you guys love it,
and he l you.

609
00:34:15,544 --> 00:34:19,710
And... that's my rant
for the day. I'm sorry.

610
00:34:19,746 --> 00:34:23,533
I like to see people
keep their legs. Ignore me.

611
00:34:23,568 --> 00:34:25,633
You know, i'm starting
my own business.

612
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:28,183
That keeps my blood pumping.

613
00:34:28,218 --> 00:34:30,111
I'm with tommy.

614
00:34:33,487 --> 00:34:35,931
Sorry, nick.

615
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:40,340
I can't believe you guys.

616
00:34:40,375 --> 00:34:44,610
I almost died jumping out
of a damn helicopter...

617
00:34:44,646 --> 00:34:48,192
When i really wanted to go
wine tasting in napa.

618
00:34:54,151 --> 00:34:55,699
Napa.

619
00:34:58,869 --> 00:35:00,383
napa!

620
00:35:08,995 --> 00:35:11,026
Ugh. It...

621
00:35:14,539 --> 00:35:16,398
The place looks different.

622
00:35:16,433 --> 00:35:17,879
Something's different.

623
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:19,843
Something
i can help you with?

624
00:35:19,878 --> 00:35:22,562
You were jealous
of her today.
I'm sorry?

625
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:25,697
Meredith. That's why
you stole her surgery.

626
00:35:25,732 --> 00:35:28,315
You miss the pace
of back-To-Back surgeries,

627
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:30,518
The adrenaline.

628
00:35:32,517 --> 00:35:34,961
Yeah, i do.

629
00:35:38,648 --> 00:35:41,092
Schedule yourself
one surgery a day--

630
00:35:41,127 --> 00:35:44,156
In the morning, rly,
an hour before anyone else--

631
00:35:44,192 --> 00:35:46,184
So at the very least
you start your day good.

632
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:48,049
You start your day cutting.

633
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:50,127
And you don't have to actually
sign all the paperwork.

634
00:35:50,128 --> 00:35:52,359
Patricia's
an excellent forger.

635
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,948
And if you eat alone
in the cafeteria,

636
00:35:53,949 --> 00:35:55,074
You are a sitting duck.

637
00:35:55,075 --> 00:35:56,901
So you need to eat
with someone else.

638
00:35:56,902 --> 00:35:59,969
That way people are more likely
to leave you alone.

639
00:36:03,272 --> 00:36:05,062
You can eat with me.

640
00:36:08,954 --> 00:36:10,469
Thank you.

641
00:36:10,538 --> 00:36:13,706
living is better
than dying...

642
00:36:15,636 --> 00:36:18,287
Until it's not.

643
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:48,077
I'm scared.

644
00:36:48,112 --> 00:36:50,488
Come here.

645
00:37:03,301 --> 00:37:05,332
But even
if letting a person die

646
00:37:05,367 --> 00:37:07,674
Is the right thing to do...

647
00:37:10,705 --> 00:37:13,976
It's not what surgeons
are built for.

648
00:37:15,802 --> 00:37:18,831
We are arrogant
and competitive.

649
00:37:26,272 --> 00:37:29,026
I'm sorry.

650
00:37:37,499 --> 00:37:39,255
I'm not mad.

651
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:40,907
I'm in whoville.

652
00:37:40,944 --> 00:37:42,458
Whoville?

653
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:44,042
Whoville.

654
00:37:48,279 --> 00:37:50,172
We don't like to lose...

655
00:37:56,303 --> 00:37:58,782
Um...

656
00:37:58,817 --> 00:38:01,055
This is really hard
for me to say,

657
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:04,258
'Cause i really care
about you, and--

658
00:38:04,293 --> 00:38:06,600
Oh, my god.
You're breaking up with me.

659
00:38:06,635 --> 00:38:10,148
Mark? Is it--Is it mark? Are you
sleeping with mark again?

660
00:38:10,183 --> 00:38:12,627
'Cause are--Are you one of
those fake lesbians,

661
00:38:12,662 --> 00:38:15,796
Just having a va-Vacation
in lesbian land and--
Stop.

662
00:38:17,449 --> 00:38:20,169
God, it's not bad.

663
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:24,509
This thing i have to tell you
isn't bad.

664
00:38:24,544 --> 00:38:28,056
Um... i just...

665
00:38:28,092 --> 00:38:30,880
I want to have a baby...

666
00:38:30,916 --> 00:38:34,772
At some point in my life.

667
00:38:34,807 --> 00:38:37,045
That's all.

668
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,042
I really...

669
00:38:39,078 --> 00:38:42,555
I have to have a baby.

670
00:38:42,591 --> 00:38:44,759
And death...

671
00:38:44,795 --> 00:38:46,825
Feels like a loss...

672
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:52,543
Even when we know it's not.

673
00:38:52,578 --> 00:38:53,955
(Knock on door

674
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:56,193
We know it's time.

675
00:38:56,228 --> 00:38:58,535
We know it's right.
Hey there.

676
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:00,636
Hey.

677
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,530
Come in.

678
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:09,383
I helped my patient
die today.

679
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:12,725
You want to talk about it?

680
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,652
No.

681
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:26,466
We know we did
everything we could.

682
00:39:34,216 --> 00:39:35,489
it's okay.

683
00:39:35,525 --> 00:39:37,797
Ok?
You gotta do it.

684
00:39:37,832 --> 00:39:41,103
You gotta do it.
I can't make you do it.

685
00:39:41,138 --> 00:39:44,684
You--You gotta do it.

686
00:39:44,721 --> 00:39:47,096
Okay?

687
00:41:02,313 --> 00:41:03,793
What are you...

688
00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:05,343
