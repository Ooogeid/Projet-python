1
00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:08,441
we ask a lot of our patients.

2
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:10,410
<i>We put them to sleep,
cut them open,</i>

3
00:00:10,444 --> 00:00:12,512
<i>Poke around in their brains
and guts</i>

4
00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:14,047
<i>With sharp instruments.</i>

5
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:16,049
<i>We ask for their blind trust.</i>

6
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:18,318
the blue one.

7
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:22,989
When in doubt,
always go with blue.

8
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,991
It brings out your eyes.

9
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,659
Yeah.

10
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:28,995
Thanks.

11
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,764
The hospital, the staff,
they love richard.

12
00:00:31,799 --> 00:00:34,701
To them, I stabbed him
in the back to get the job.

13
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:38,404
They're gonna be mad at me
just like you are. I am mad.

14
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:41,207
That doesn't mean I don't think
you'll do a great job.

15
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:43,042
I think you'll be
a very good chief.

16
00:00:43,077 --> 00:00:45,745
<i>Irony is,
trust is hard for surgeons,</i>

17
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:47,814
<i>Because we're trained
from day one</i>

18
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:50,283
<i>That we can't trust anyone
but ourselves.</i>

19
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:54,587
<i>The only instincts you can
count on are your own...</i>

20
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,495
Either one of you know what this
big meeting's all about?

21
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:05,465
I heard there was a coup. Webber's
out. Shepherd's in. Is that true?

22
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:08,368
We know what you know. Bull. All
right? Your sister's married to the guy.

23
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:11,571
You expect me to bve you don't know what's going
on? Don't you have your own loser friends to talk to?

24
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:13,539
I also heard shepherd plans
to clean house.

25
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:16,042
Maybe he'll start with you. Dude,
I'm safe. The guy is my roommate.

26
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,544
You're the ones who should watch
your backs. Why? What do you know?

27
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,513
Simple math-
shepherd hates the merger,

28
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:23,049
You're from mercy west, you're
toast. Derek's not gonna fire people

29
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,084
Just because
they're from mercy west.

30
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,053
He's not like that.
He's loyal and fair.

31
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,022
Yeah,
tell that to webber.

32
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:31,524
<i>The only skills
you can count on are your own.</i>

33
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:34,460
<i>Until one day,
you leave the classroom</i>

34
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:36,863
<i>And step into the o.R.</i>

35
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:39,832
I think we've almost got
the tumor out.

36
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:42,235
At this rate, we'll be
finished early, gr.

37
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,837
You might be able
to catch the end

38
00:01:44,872 --> 00:01:47,707
Of shepherd's big speech.

39
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:49,175
She's tachycardic.

40
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:52,478
<i>You're surrounded by others,
a team of others...</i>

41
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:54,881
I don't understand
what happened.

42
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:58,918
Everything appears to be in order here.
There's-there's no bleeders. I don't see any bleeders.

43
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,821
Okay, I-I don't see
a- a reason why down here,

44
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:04,691
So why is her heart rate
going through the roof?

45
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:07,827
Did you check her anastomosis? Her
anastomosis is intact. Everything is intact.

46
00:02:10,064 --> 00:02:13,700
What is-wait, wait, wait.
Did I just feel movement?

47
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:23,409
She's awake, dr. Bailey.
The patient's awake.

48
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:30,116
<i>A team that you
have to rely on...</i>

49
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:38,725
<i>Whether you trust them
or not.</i>

50
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:41,127
Well, what the hell
did you do?

51
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,163
What the hell did you do?
Get her back to sleep right now.

52
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:46,532
okay, I know
you're scared right now,

53
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:48,968
But it's gonna be okay.
Everything is going to be okay.

54
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,737
Just try to breathe.

55
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:53,339
Pushing 150 of propofol.

56
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,913
Hey.

57
00:03:00,948 --> 00:03:03,082
You think he's gonna give
a big speech?

58
00:03:03,117 --> 00:03:04,550
I don't know.

59
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:06,986
So, um, look, about
the other ght. I was-

60
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,989
I don't want
to talk about it.

61
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:19,332
What the hell is he wearing?
He looks good. Chiefly.

62
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,634
He looks like an undertaker.

63
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,770
I promised him we'd clap.
Oh. Now?

64
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:25,004
No.

65
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:36,449
Ahem.

66
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:39,018
I want to thank you all
for being here.

67
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,988
I know you're busy,
so I'll try to make this quick.

68
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:44,557
As you may have heard,
I have been appointed

69
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:47,226
The new
interim chief of surgery.

70
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,662
It's my personal goal
to make this transition

71
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,697
The new
inteas smooth as possible.

72
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,966
I know we've had a rocky
few months. Here it comes.

73
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:56,335
Mistakes have been made.
He's talking about the merger.

74
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,372
Shh. I intend to right
those wrongs, and, uh...

75
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:00,907
Told you.

76
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:03,776
Bring this hospital
back to its former glory.

77
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:06,112
"former glory." undertaker
needs a speechwriter.

78
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:08,981
We are screwed.
S, you are, sucker.

79
00:04:09,016 --> 00:04:11,217
Check it out. Chief webber.

80
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,287
And, um...

81
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:17,990
What I meant...

82
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:21,027
Uh, by that is-
what I'm trying to say is,

83
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:23,496
I want to thank you
for your support in advance.

84
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,031
Uh, that's all.

85
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:27,834
Okay, let's get back to work.

86
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:44,717
Avery, I need you
to round up my charts

87
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:47,053
And bring 'em to room 22-14.

88
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,255
Oh, yang, usually comes in early
to do that. I'm sure-

89
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,357
You know what? Yang's not on
my service today. You are.

90
00:04:51,392 --> 00:04:53,760
Karev, I hear that
you' the future of peds.

91
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:56,696
Excuse me? Yeah, a little birdie
named bailey whispered it in my ear.

92
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,699
I want you to work with me today so I
can see if she's right. What did she say?

93
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:01,968
That you're the best babysitter
in the hospital.

94
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:03,403
Shut up.

95
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:05,939
You don't think peds
is hard-core?

96
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:08,875
'cause you could say that to my face,
avery. no. No, ma'am.

97
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:11,311
Mm-hmm. Don't let
the roller skates fool you.

98
00:05:11,345 --> 00:05:15,281
Peds is nothing but hard-core.
Rounds in ten.

99
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:16,483
Peds.

100
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:18,952
Who's the sucker now?

101
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:21,988
I heard that...

102
00:05:23,357 --> 00:05:25,758
Sloan was released
from the hospital in l.A.

103
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:27,427
That's good.

104
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:31,064
Is she, uh, is she
coming back soon? Mark?

105
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:32,999
This is
some kind of joke.

106
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:35,602
You're not even gonna
look at me? Torres...

107
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:38,571
I have a hip decubitus ulcer
I need you to check out.

108
00:05:38,606 --> 00:05:41,608
Mature.
Really mature, mark.

109
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:44,444
Basically, you have
two options available to you.

110
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:47,714
You sign these, you're agreeing
to an early retirement.

111
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:50,984
Take an early pension, your
license to practice medicine

112
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,919
Will no longer be valid.

113
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:55,288
You'd walk away from this
hospital effective immediately,

114
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:56,723
No strings attached.

115
00:05:56,757 --> 00:05:59,826
You're not gonna sign that.
You're gonna sign this.

116
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,296
which says that you are
voluntarily enrolling yourself

117
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,999
In the physicians rehabilitation
and treatment program.

118
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,467
Go to rehab, richard.

119
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:13,840
You sober up, you get out,
you have your job waiting.

120
00:06:19,914 --> 00:06:22,649
Pendii need some time to think.

121
00:06:25,286 --> 00:06:27,987
What is there
to think about?

122
00:06:28,022 --> 00:06:31,124
You aren't considering quitting,
are you?

123
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:34,093
Sorry to interrupt,
but, chief.

124
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:36,329
Yeah.
Uh, yeah.

125
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:37,830
I'm sorry. Dr. Shepherd,

126
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:40,700
There's a situation
that needs your attention.

127
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,303
Excuse me.

128
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:50,910
She had the appropriate amount of anesthetic. There is no
- the patient was open on the table...

129
00:06:50,945 --> 00:06:53,513
There is no way I'm implicated in this,
right? And he allowed her to wake up.

130
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:56,282
Stop. Stop. Just every-
stop. Just take a deep breath.

131
00:06:56,317 --> 00:06:58,251
You check on the patient.
Okay.

132
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:01,187
This can happen.
It's happened to me.

133
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:03,823
Any luck at all,
she won't remember a thing.

134
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:06,326
Which means she won't
remember to sue us? Exactly.

135
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,261
Okay, how was that?
That was good, right?

136
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:09,796
Yeah, very chiefly.
Good.

137
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,732
Lose the tie.
What? Not the tie.

138
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,401
Mr. And mrs. Wilson,

139
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:17,670
We're here to update you
on the surgery.

140
00:07:17,705 --> 00:07:19,572
We completed
your tumor resection.

141
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:21,541
I was able to resect
the entire thing

142
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:24,377
Off of your abdominal wall.
Mm-hmm, which is a good thing.

143
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:26,746
Things went very well.
Really?

144
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,617
How about the part when I
woke up on the table?

145
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:33,753
How well did that part go?

146
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:36,322
Where I could smell
my own burning flesh-

147
00:07:36,357 --> 00:07:38,091
How was that?

148
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,059
When I was lying there...

149
00:07:40,094 --> 00:07:42,095
unable to speak

150
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,664
While I could actually
feel you butchering my insides

151
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:47,300
I couldn't move. I was
awake and couldn't move,

152
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:49,702
And you had no idea.

153
00:07:49,737 --> 00:07:52,872
How well did that part go?

154
00:07:55,112 --> 00:07:56,379
Here's what we do.

155
00:07:56,414 --> 00:07:58,148
I'm gonna check
the anesthetics themselves.

156
00:07:58,182 --> 00:08:00,116
You draw a c.B.C.,
a chem-18,

157
00:08:00,151 --> 00:08:02,586
And let's do some genotyping studies.
Oh, oh, "here's what we do"? We?

158
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,255
Did you not hear her?
That girl is traumatized.

159
00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:08,024
So the only thing we are doing
is getting sued...

160
00:08:08,059 --> 00:08:09,626
Because of you.

161
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,262
Where do you even get off
speaking to me like that?

162
00:08:12,296 --> 00:08:14,798
You have no idea what went wrong in
that o.R. Well, here's what I know-

163
00:08:14,832 --> 00:08:16,733
I know that you're new here,

164
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:19,035
I know that you probably sti
have a chip on your shoulder

165
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:21,004
Because your parking space
at mercy west was better

166
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:23,073
And I know that you're
an anesthesiologist,

167
00:08:23,107 --> 00:08:25,075
Which means you make
buckets of money

168
00:08:25,109 --> 00:08:27,077
Logging reasonable hours
sitting on your behind

169
00:08:27,111 --> 00:08:29,012
And flipping through
"architectural digest"

170
00:08:29,046 --> 00:08:31,047
While somebody on
the other side of the curtain

171
00:08:31,082 --> 00:08:33,049
Does the real work
and gets sued for it.

172
00:08:33,084 --> 00:08:35,819
Excuse me. You have no idea
- I don't know what they did at mercy west,

173
00:08:35,853 --> 00:08:37,787
But here at seattle grace,

174
00:08:37,822 --> 00:08:40,357
We expect to be able
to trust the gas man,

175
00:08:40,391 --> 00:08:43,159
Trust him to do his job
so that we can do ours.

176
00:08:43,194 --> 00:08:46,763
We expect the gas man
to stay awake at the switch

177
00:08:46,797 --> 00:08:49,933
No matter how long and boring
a procedure might be.

178
00:08:49,967 --> 00:08:52,268
We expect the gas man
to stay focused enough

179
00:08:52,303 --> 00:08:55,071
To keep the patient
unconscious!

180
00:09:00,077 --> 00:09:03,113
How long would you say
brad's been having the pain?

181
00:09:03,147 --> 00:09:05,215
Off and on for months.

182
00:09:05,249 --> 00:09:08,685
Brad, is the pain constant
or is it worse at times,

183
00:09:08,719 --> 00:09:11,121
Better at others? Mm, it's
usually bad in the mornings,

184
00:09:11,155 --> 00:09:13,490
Like, right after breakfast.
which, I might point out,

185
00:09:13,524 --> 00:09:16,126
Is, uh, when he
has to go to school.

186
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,696
But I feel it at other times, too. Right,
like, uh, when you have a spanish test

187
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:22,699
Or, uh, have to give
a presentation in history class.

188
00:09:22,733 --> 00:09:26,069
Stress can exacerbate abdominal pain.
Please, doctor, don't encourage him.

189
00:09:26,103 --> 00:09:28,304
He's just faking so he
could miss school. I am not.

190
00:09:28,339 --> 00:09:30,407
Abdomen's soft, non-tender,
not rigid.

191
00:09:30,441 --> 00:09:32,342
Bowel sounds are good.

192
00:09:32,376 --> 00:09:34,678
Still, I'd like to cover
all the bases.

193
00:09:34,712 --> 00:09:38,048
Dr. Karev, how would you proceed?
We could try a trip-contrast c.T.

194
00:09:38,082 --> 00:09:39,516
Mm-hmm. Do it.

195
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,518
Brad, this is gonna cost us
thousands of dollars,

196
00:09:41,552 --> 00:09:43,787
And insurance
only covers part of it.

197
00:09:43,821 --> 00:09:45,922
You-you know that, right?
I'm not faking it.

198
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:48,625
I- I'm not faking it, dad.
I swear.

199
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,935
Dr. Altman, uh, I noticed
you have avery assigned

200
00:09:58,969 --> 00:10:01,504
To all your surgeries
this morning. I do.

201
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:05,341
Um, so there's no room...
For me on your service?

202
00:10:05,376 --> 00:10:08,144
Well, you've been on every one
of my cases since I've arrived.

203
00:10:08,179 --> 00:10:10,113
This is a teaching htal.

204
00:10:10,147 --> 00:10:13,049
It's only fair I give
other residents a chance.

205
00:10:13,084 --> 00:10:16,186
Yes. Yes, of course. I-I-
I understand.

206
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,289
Um... Do you think you'll have
room on your service tomorrow

207
00:10:19,323 --> 00:10:21,024
Or the next day?

208
00:10:21,058 --> 00:10:23,093
I, uh, I...
I- I don't know.

209
00:10:23,127 --> 00:10:25,161
I just...

210
00:10:27,164 --> 00:10:29,165
I can't today, cristina.
Okay?

211
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,769
I just... I can't.

212
00:10:35,372 --> 00:10:36,706
Um, leslie, hi.

213
00:10:36,741 --> 00:10:39,909
Uh, this will
only take a moment.

214
00:10:39,944 --> 00:10:42,746
We just need to examine your incis
- hey, careful.

215
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:45,715
I don't want you
to touch me.

216
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,484
Leslie...
I mean it.

217
00:10:47,518 --> 00:10:49,753
Don't let her touch me.

218
00:10:49,787 --> 00:10:52,956
Okay, uh, I-I know that you've
been through a lot today,

219
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:55,925
But if we don't check your in-
I remember.

220
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:00,897
I remember
you screaming in surgery.

221
00:11:00,931 --> 00:11:04,334
You were panicking...
She's getting tachycardic.

222
00:11:04,368 --> 00:11:07,203
Panicking with your hand inside my
body.

223
00:11:07,238 --> 00:11:09,038
You were just...

224
00:11:09,073 --> 00:11:12,008
dr. Bailey, her
incision site is bleeding.

225
00:11:12,042 --> 00:11:14,644
She could've ripped it open.
I mean it. Don't touch me!

226
00:11:14,678 --> 00:11:17,413
Okay. I don't want you
to touch me. Don't t-no!

227
00:11:17,448 --> 00:11:20,550
Grey, redress the wound, okay?
Don't touch me!

228
00:11:20,584 --> 00:11:22,886
Uh, use the dressing to apply
pressure with one hand

229
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,321
And grab as much gauze as
you can with the other. Okay.

230
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:27,724
See that tape there?
You're gonna need you

231
00:11:27,758 --> 00:11:29,425
A nice, long piece.
Uh-huh.

232
00:11:33,297 --> 00:11:34,864
Hey. Need some help?

233
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:36,699
Uh, no. I'm good. Thanks.

234
00:11:37,868 --> 00:11:39,369
Okay. Never mind.

235
00:11:39,403 --> 00:11:41,871
I need to talk to you
about mark.

236
00:11:41,906 --> 00:11:43,273
Could you not rip those?

237
00:11:43,307 --> 00:11:45,275
He isn't speaking to me.
He barely even looks at me.

238
00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:48,144
And I know that we broke up,
but we still work together,

239
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:51,281
And I'm gonna be a plastic surgeon.
You're not gonna be a plastic surgeon.

240
00:11:51,315 --> 00:11:53,750
Still, okay, we're gonna have to
see each other every day.

241
00:11:53,784 --> 00:11:56,686
I mean, he's best friends with
my sister's post-it husband.

242
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,622
I... I don't know what to do. I
know. He's not exactly being fair.

243
00:11:59,657 --> 00:12:02,625
No, he's not being fair. Hey,
seriously. Go easy on the cast padding.

244
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,527
You know, at least
he could be civil.

245
00:12:04,562 --> 00:12:07,564
I had a one-night stand.
Okay, big deal. Right.

246
00:12:07,598 --> 00:12:10,099
It's not like he didn't sleep
with addison. True, more than once.

247
00:12:10,134 --> 00:12:13,203
What?
Hmm?

248
00:12:13,237 --> 00:12:15,972
Nothing. I didn't say
anything. More than once?

249
00:12:16,006 --> 00:12:18,241
More than once?!

250
00:12:18,275 --> 00:12:20,343
Oh!

251
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:25,314
what about that?
That spot-see it?

252
00:12:25,348 --> 00:12:27,316
Oh. That was lint.

253
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:30,285
It doesn't make sense.
I mean, no kid wants to be

254
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,755
The loser missing class
to go to the hospital.

255
00:12:32,789 --> 00:12:34,790
I don't care
how lame you are.

256
00:12:34,824 --> 00:12:36,892
I loved the hospital
when I was a kid.

257
00:12:36,926 --> 00:12:39,294
No school, lots of cool
medical supplies to play with

258
00:12:39,329 --> 00:12:40,729
And...

259
00:12:40,764 --> 00:12:42,698
Okay, yeah.
So let's go over it again.

260
00:12:42,732 --> 00:12:45,300
He presented with severe
but intermittent abdominal pain,

261
00:12:45,335 --> 00:12:46,735
No discernable pattern.

262
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:48,837
Labs were normal.
No fever.

263
00:12:48,872 --> 00:12:51,273
Soft abdomen on exam.

264
00:12:51,307 --> 00:12:54,176
We're missing something.

265
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,678
Chronic mesenteric ischemia?

266
00:12:56,713 --> 00:12:58,580
Ah. I mean,
it's a stretch for a kid,

267
00:12:58,615 --> 00:13:00,816
But if he had vascular problems
- no, it fits all the symptoms,

268
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:03,085
And it doesn't show up on the
scans. Yeah, but the problem is,

269
00:13:03,119 --> 00:13:05,087
The only way to get
an accurate diagnosis

270
00:13:05,121 --> 00:13:07,656
Is to run an exploratory
laparoscopy. So?

271
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:10,058
Brad's father didn't want us
to run a c.T.

272
00:13:10,093 --> 00:13:12,995
You really think he's gonna
agree to exploratory surgery?

273
00:13:18,701 --> 00:13:21,904
Hey. You-you know, why-
teddy's blackballing me.

274
00:13:21,938 --> 00:13:24,072
She's not saying
that's what she's doing,

275
00:13:24,107 --> 00:13:26,708
But I think
that's what she's do-

276
00:13:26,743 --> 00:13:28,510
Mm.

277
00:13:33,983 --> 00:13:35,951
I don't want to talk
about teddy.

278
00:13:35,985 --> 00:13:37,920
Do you want
to talk about teddy?

279
00:13:37,954 --> 00:13:39,555
No.

280
00:13:47,831 --> 00:13:50,766
I heard he had
some kind of mental breakdown.

281
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,267
I heard it was drugs.

282
00:13:52,302 --> 00:13:54,069
No way. Prescription or-

283
00:13:54,103 --> 00:13:57,039
Go practice medicine, now.

284
00:13:57,073 --> 00:13:59,875
Richard.
This-sitting here-

285
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:01,510
This isn't good.
This isn't helping things.

286
00:14:01,544 --> 00:14:04,046
Just sign the paper.
Go to rehab.

287
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,449
Sign the paper. Who the hell do
you think you are? Who do you-

288
00:14:07,483 --> 00:14:10,652
Look, you are not my boss
and you are not my chief.

289
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,821
You may have stolen my office out
from under me... You're in trouble...

290
00:14:12,856 --> 00:14:15,224
But you have no right
- and I am trying to help you like you helped me.

291
00:14:15,258 --> 00:14:18,327
I helped you! I didn't get you fired. You got
fired the minute you took your first drink.

292
00:14:18,361 --> 00:14:20,762
Get out of my face. No. No,
you're not gonna do this.

293
00:14:20,797 --> 00:14:23,198
You're not ending your career
to get back at me.

294
00:14:23,233 --> 00:14:26,368
I did what I had to do and nothing more. You
look me in the eye and you say that again.

295
00:14:29,539 --> 00:14:32,941
I wanted the job.

296
00:14:32,976 --> 00:14:35,911
I wanted the job.
I admit that.

297
00:14:35,945 --> 00:14:39,014
I didn't want to end your career.
Well, that part's not up to you, is it?

298
00:14:39,048 --> 00:14:41,083
You did what you had to do.

299
00:14:41,117 --> 00:14:44,052
But this part...
Is up to me.

300
00:14:44,087 --> 00:14:45,854
So get out.

301
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:47,990
No!
Stop it, both of you.

302
00:14:48,024 --> 00:14:50,626
People are watching.

303
00:14:59,302 --> 00:15:01,503
Get back to work.

304
00:15:24,774 --> 00:15:27,676
The gas man
would like an apology.

305
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,110
What?

306
00:15:29,145 --> 00:15:32,047
Leslie wilson's
cytochrome p-450 results.

307
00:15:32,081 --> 00:15:33,648
The type she has means

308
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:36,151
She metabolizes
anesthetic drugs too fast-

309
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,119
Way more rapidly
than you or me.

310
00:15:38,154 --> 00:15:40,588
There's no way we could've
known that before surgery.

311
00:15:40,623 --> 00:15:42,457
So this is why she woke up?

312
00:15:42,491 --> 00:15:44,092
It is.

313
00:15:44,126 --> 00:15:46,928
You don't have to get down
on your knees and apologize,

314
00:15:46,962 --> 00:15:49,097
But I would like something
heartfelt.

315
00:15:49,131 --> 00:15:51,566
You know, something
in the neighborhood of,

316
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,468
"you were right.
I was rash, kind of mean."

317
00:15:53,502 --> 00:15:55,670
Maybe even throw in
a, "turns out

318
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:58,039
You're a hell of a doctor."

319
00:15:58,074 --> 00:16:01,443
It wasn't our fault.
That's... That's good news.

320
00:16:01,477 --> 00:16:03,345
She's gonna need
a second surgery.

321
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,947
The incision site
won't stop bleeding.

322
00:16:05,981 --> 00:16:08,183
She might have
internal bleeding.

323
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,151
Okay.
It's not gonna be easy,

324
00:16:10,186 --> 00:16:12,387
But now I know
how to keep her under.

325
00:16:12,421 --> 00:16:16,624
She won't let me touch her.

326
00:16:16,659 --> 00:16:18,626
Oh.

327
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,431
I'm good with patients.

328
00:16:23,466 --> 00:16:25,367
They always trust me.

329
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,535
I- I-I've never...

330
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,538
Look, I don't even know
how to...

331
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:34,008
She won't let touch her.

332
00:16:41,384 --> 00:16:43,451
Why are you walking
like that?

333
00:16:43,486 --> 00:16:44,919
Uh, I got a burn.

334
00:16:44,954 --> 00:16:46,121
Where?

335
00:16:46,155 --> 00:16:47,555
Go away.

336
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,958
Well, we're both doctors.
No need to be embarrassed.

337
00:16:49,992 --> 00:16:52,727
I'm not embarrassed.
I'm just waiting for meredith.

338
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:55,263
Now... Go away. I let you
treat my tick. Come on.

339
00:16:55,297 --> 00:16:57,899
This is not a tick.
today sucks.

340
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,901
Mark sucks.

341
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,770
Yeah? Yang got burns
on her girl parts.

342
00:17:01,804 --> 00:17:03,371
Oh.
Oh, wow.

343
00:17:03,406 --> 00:17:05,273
I do not-it's not on-
on my girl parts.

344
00:17:05,307 --> 00:17:08,343
Well, then they're on her ass. Look how
she's walking. Don't you two have patnts?

345
00:17:08,377 --> 00:17:10,879
How did you get burns
on your ass? You paged?

346
00:17:10,913 --> 00:17:12,447
Mer, come.

347
00:17:12,481 --> 00:17:16,050
The rest of you, bye.

348
00:17:16,085 --> 00:17:18,319
oh, my god!

349
00:17:18,354 --> 00:17:21,089
not so loud.

350
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,525
How did you...
What did...

351
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:26,327
You have grate marks
burned into your ass.

352
00:17:26,362 --> 00:17:28,963
yeah, vent marks,
but same difference.

353
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:33,468
I was busy having sex.

354
00:17:33,502 --> 00:17:36,671
will you please
just dress the wound?

355
00:17:36,705 --> 00:17:39,808
Owen's being
very caveman-like.

356
00:17:39,842 --> 00:17:41,209
And it's hot-

357
00:17:41,243 --> 00:17:45,313
Vaguely disturbing,
but mostly hot.

358
00:17:45,347 --> 00:17:48,249
I- I think he might
ill be a little upset

359
00:17:48,284 --> 00:17:51,252
That I offered him
to teddy.

360
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:53,188
Alex!
Alex!

361
00:17:53,222 --> 00:17:54,889
Oh.
Hot cross buns.

362
00:17:54,924 --> 00:17:58,026
That's gonna blister. Will
you get them out of here?

363
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,695
I
- bailey's paging me. Lexie, will you finish this for me?

364
00:18:00,729 --> 00:18:03,097
Oh, oh, my god. I hate you. What...
I'll take alex with me.

365
00:18:03,132 --> 00:18:04,899
Let's go. Come on.

366
00:18:04,934 --> 00:18:06,367
Ugh.

367
00:18:06,402 --> 00:18:08,770
Is this a sex injury?
Oh, my god.

368
00:18:08,804 --> 00:18:11,473
It is.

369
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,476
I used to have sex injuries
with mark.

370
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,377
Mark was rlly awesome

371
00:18:16,412 --> 00:18:19,214
At leaving you with good...
sex injuries.

372
00:18:19,248 --> 00:18:22,150
And...

373
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,686
please
don't cry on my ass.

374
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,554
I'm sorry.
Please don't cry.

375
00:18:30,459 --> 00:18:31,893
Hey, are you-

376
00:18:31,927 --> 00:18:34,329
Busy.

377
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:37,298
Dr. Altman... I pulled
everything you asked for.

378
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:40,401
It's all here in numerical order
according to room number.

379
00:18:40,436 --> 00:18:42,103
Numerical order?

380
00:18:42,137 --> 00:18:44,072
Is that not how-
it's fine.

381
00:18:44,106 --> 00:18:46,674
Yang always orders them
according to priority-

382
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:49,077
Most urgent to least urgent-

383
00:18:49,111 --> 00:18:51,101
But... It's fine.
It-it'll work. Follow me.

384
00:18:52,315 --> 00:18:55,184
No. Just no. You are not cutting
open our son with no evidence

385
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:57,186
That there's anything
even wrong- dad-

386
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,188
Jim-
no! Listen to me,

387
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:01,257
That is thousands of dollars
we're talking about,

388
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,691
On what, a hunch, huh?

389
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:05,828
He's got nervous stomach
and crappy grades. That's it.

390
00:19:05,862 --> 00:19:07,863
I hated school, too, brad.
Okay? I got it.

391
00:19:07,898 --> 00:19:10,533
Your mother and I,
we have jobs and we go to them.

392
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:13,435
You have school.
That's your job.

393
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:16,438
No surgery. It's insane.
Just-no. No.

394
00:19:19,643 --> 00:19:21,977
You think it's right
for them to take him home?

395
00:19:22,012 --> 00:19:24,813
It isn't. Shh. Brad, I'm
teaching. You think he's faking?

396
00:19:24,848 --> 00:19:27,216
No.
What are you gonna do?

397
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,718
I'd like to push his dad's face
into a wall. No offense.

398
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:32,288
Yeah, no. That-that'd be good.
Well, barring physical violence,

399
00:19:32,322 --> 00:19:33,956
What are you gonna do?

400
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:37,026
This is peds. Your patients
can't advocate for themselves.

401
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,361
So in addition to surgery,
a big part of the job

402
00:19:39,396 --> 00:19:42,631
Is advocating for them.
You think you can do that?

403
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,700
Yes,
this is exploratory surgery,

404
00:19:44,734 --> 00:19:47,269
And, yes, brad's scans
look clean, but if we're right,

405
00:19:47,304 --> 00:19:49,371
If he has mesenteric ischemia
and you take him home,

406
00:19:49,406 --> 00:19:52,441
The blood flow to his intestine
will slowly stop,

407
00:19:52,475 --> 00:19:55,044
Killing the tissue,
causing brad to become septic,

408
00:19:55,078 --> 00:19:57,046
Forcing his body
into such intense shock

409
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,114
That by the time you realize
what's happening

410
00:19:59,149 --> 00:20:00,549
And you call an ambulance,

411
00:20:00,584 --> 00:20:03,052
The chance of brad getting back
to the hospital alive

412
00:20:03,086 --> 00:20:04,486
Is next to zero.

413
00:20:04,521 --> 00:20:06,555
You think he's faking.
I get that.

414
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:10,359
So the only real question is,
how sure are you? How sure?

415
00:20:13,723 --> 00:20:14,990
I understand your hesitation,

416
00:20:15,024 --> 00:20:17,626
But we don't have a choice.
You need a second surgery.

417
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:21,129
Haven't you put her through enough for one day? I
can make some calls, see if we can get you transferred

418
00:20:21,164 --> 00:20:22,764
To another hospital.

419
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,200
A transfer takes time,
and the longer we wait,

420
00:20:25,234 --> 00:20:29,137
She's at greater risk for infection or
blood loss. Leslie, I know you're scared,

421
00:20:29,172 --> 00:20:31,873
But the dressing I did earlier
is only temporary.

422
00:20:31,908 --> 00:20:33,975
It needs
to be fixed proper.

423
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:38,625
It was like being in a coffin-
alive... In a coffin.

424
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:41,081
I couldn't talk,
couldn't move.

425
00:20:41,116 --> 00:20:44,522
The thought of your hand
back inside me...

426
00:20:45,442 --> 00:20:47,797
Leslie, sweetie, you don't
have to do anything

427
00:20:47,832 --> 00:20:49,191
You don't want to do.

428
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:54,862
You can do it.

429
00:20:54,896 --> 00:20:56,163
What?

430
00:20:56,198 --> 00:20:58,099
You were there.

431
00:20:58,133 --> 00:21:01,802
You stayed calm.
You were kind.

432
00:21:01,837 --> 00:21:04,939
Oh, dr. Bailey is
far more experienced than-

433
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:07,341
She's not touching me.

434
00:21:07,376 --> 00:21:09,977
You have to promise me
she won't touch me.

435
00:21:10,011 --> 00:21:12,246
You can do it.

436
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:16,951
She can't.

437
00:21:19,855 --> 00:21:21,355
Hey.
hey.

438
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,790
hey.

439
00:21:22,858 --> 00:21:25,259
What do you think of
the present I got from hunt

440
00:21:25,293 --> 00:21:27,194
For becoming chief?
From hunt, huh?

441
00:21:27,229 --> 00:21:29,263
I was gonna get you
one of those.

442
00:21:29,297 --> 00:21:32,199
The deluxe version. You know,
the kind that keeps score?

443
00:21:32,234 --> 00:21:34,502
Not, uh, you know, the
cheaper one. That's my chair.

444
00:21:34,536 --> 00:21:38,139
I know. I like it. Itakes me feel
powerful. That was quite a scene

445
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:40,574
In the conference room
earlier. Oh, you saw that.

446
00:21:40,609 --> 00:21:42,510
Yeah, the whole hospital did.
What happened there?

447
00:21:42,544 --> 00:21:44,979
How'd you dethrone the chief
and-and why? I can't talk about it.

448
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:47,748
Not even to me?
It's not my story to tell.

449
00:21:47,816 --> 00:21:50,818
Heads-up. Looks like
I'm facing a lawsuit.

450
00:21:50,852 --> 00:21:54,922
First day out-patient wakes up on the
table. You know lexie slept with alex karev

451
00:21:54,956 --> 00:21:59,326
While I was in l.A. Dealing with my sick
daughter? Well, according to meredith,

452
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:01,395
You were doing a little more
in los angeles

453
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:04,098
Than just dealing with
little sloan. She dumped me.

454
00:22:04,132 --> 00:22:06,901
Which is why you went back to sleeping
with my ex-wife? You slept with his ex-wife?

455
00:22:06,935 --> 00:22:09,470
Wait a sec. You're remarried.
What do you care? I'm just saying,

456
00:22:09,504 --> 00:22:12,506
The karev thing is forgivable
considering. Not to me.

457
00:22:14,509 --> 00:22:16,610
What?
Is that a hickey?

458
00:22:16,645 --> 00:22:19,780
Uh, it's, uh, it's-it's a
birthmark. It is. It's a hiey.

459
00:22:19,815 --> 00:22:21,282
yeah.

460
00:22:21,316 --> 00:22:23,918
All right, cristina and I
have been... Getting along.

461
00:22:23,952 --> 00:22:25,886
Well, you two
are good together.

462
00:22:25,921 --> 00:22:27,788
Not like me and lexie
or...

463
00:22:27,823 --> 00:22:31,091
Way better than yang and burke.
Yeah, I never understood those two.

464
00:22:31,126 --> 00:22:34,428
They were too... Monosyllabic. You know, I
made a bet she'd never make it down that aisle.

465
00:22:34,463 --> 00:22:36,096
Won 50 bucks.
What aisle?

466
00:22:36,131 --> 00:22:38,232
Oh, you haven't heard
that story? That's a good story.

467
00:22:38,266 --> 00:22:41,535
Uh, it's not your story
to tell.

468
00:22:47,042 --> 00:22:48,809
Bailey is letting me operate

469
00:22:48,844 --> 00:22:51,011
On a post-op
internal bleeding patient...

470
00:22:51,046 --> 00:22:53,380
By myself.

471
00:22:53,448 --> 00:22:55,883
Do you think
I n handle it?

472
00:22:58,353 --> 00:23:00,721
I think I can.

473
00:23:02,524 --> 00:23:05,926
Derek tells me
you're thinking about quitting.

474
00:23:10,065 --> 00:23:13,367
I think if my mother
were here to see this,

475
00:23:13,401 --> 00:23:17,938
She would kick your ass
for even considering it.

476
00:23:27,382 --> 00:23:30,718
These ops of bowel
look clean, too.

477
00:23:30,752 --> 00:23:33,354
Nothing.

478
00:23:33,388 --> 00:23:35,322
Crap. I bullied them into
totally unnecessary surgery

479
00:23:35,357 --> 00:23:36,690
For their kid.

480
00:23:36,725 --> 00:23:38,993
No, it wasn't unnecessary.
By not finding anything,

481
00:23:39,027 --> 00:23:41,662
We're one step closer to finding
out what isn't wrong with brad,

482
00:23:41,696 --> 00:23:44,331
Which means we're one step
closer to finding what is.

483
00:23:44,366 --> 00:23:46,500
At least that's what
you're gonna tell

484
00:23:46,535 --> 00:23:48,402
His very angry parents.
Me?

485
00:23:48,436 --> 00:23:50,504
Yeah. You bullied 'em
into surgery.

486
00:23:50,539 --> 00:23:53,641
You're gonna take the heat. More suction,
please.

487
00:23:53,675 --> 00:23:55,576
B.P. Took a dip.
He's getting unstable.

488
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:57,545
Bolus him with a liter,
and let's get him closed.

489
00:23:57,579 --> 00:23:59,580
All right. We may not
have found the problem,

490
00:23:59,614 --> 00:24:01,615
But there's absolutely
something wrong here.

491
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:05,119
you know...
There isn't anything that says

492
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:06,987
You can't operate
once she's under.

493
00:24:07,022 --> 00:24:09,390
She would never know. I'm
not operating on a patient

494
00:24:09,424 --> 00:24:11,225
Who doesn't want me
to operate on her.

495
00:24:11,259 --> 00:24:13,694
If she wants a resident
doing her surgery,

496
00:24:13,728 --> 00:24:16,430
She gets a resident
doing her surgery.

497
00:24:16,464 --> 00:24:17,932
I wouldn't let you operate

498
00:24:17,966 --> 00:24:19,767
Unless I thought
you could handle it.

499
00:24:19,801 --> 00:24:23,337
Well, I could perforate
her bowel. You won't!

500
00:24:25,173 --> 00:24:27,141
Look, I'll be with you
the whole time.

501
00:24:27,175 --> 00:24:29,410
Hey, dr. Webber
was mentoring you.

502
00:24:29,444 --> 00:24:31,812
There's no reason
why I can't do the same.

503
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:33,814
Well, the chief
sn't exactly mentoring me

504
00:24:33,848 --> 00:24:36,150
Because of my talent.
Richard webber is not a man

505
00:24:36,184 --> 00:24:38,118
Who wastes his time
on just anybody.

506
00:24:38,153 --> 00:24:40,721
The last time he mentored
a surgeon, it was me.

507
00:24:40,755 --> 00:24:43,123
What, you think
I don't have talent?

508
00:24:43,158 --> 00:24:45,893
All right. Well, hurry up
and finish scrubbing in.

509
00:24:45,927 --> 00:24:48,395
You've got
a patient waiting.

510
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,535
Do you really think shepherd's
gonna cut all of us? What?

511
00:24:54,569 --> 00:24:56,537
The mercy westers-
do you think we're all gone?

512
00:24:56,571 --> 00:24:57,972
I mean, just tell me

513
00:24:58,006 --> 00:24:59,907
If you think that I need
to start looking for a job?

514
00:24:59,941 --> 00:25:02,943
Is there a reason our son is in I.C.U.?
did you figure out what's wrong?

515
00:25:02,978 --> 00:25:06,580
Uh, not exactly. Why does
he have a tube in his chest?

516
00:25:06,615 --> 00:25:08,616
You said you were doing
abdominal surgery.

517
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:11,218
Brad became
briefly unstable in surgery,

518
00:25:11,252 --> 00:25:13,053
Sohad to put in
a central line.

519
00:25:13,088 --> 00:25:15,556
Well, it's got a little kink, so his lung, it started
- alex!

520
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,725
Hang on. Are you saying you
cut into our son for nothing

521
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:19,927
And caused more damage?
Wait. What?

522
00:25:19,961 --> 00:25:23,030
Blood. Blood. There is a lot of blood
in the chest tube. What? Oh, my god.

523
00:25:23,064 --> 00:25:26,500
Get-get a chest tray and some gloves.
He's already put out 700 cc's of blood.

524
00:25:26,534 --> 00:25:28,602
What's going on? Sir, you
need to leave right now.

525
00:25:28,637 --> 00:25:31,271
Like hell we're leaving.
Somebody tell us what's going on.

526
00:25:31,306 --> 00:25:33,407
He's crashing. Page cardio
and robbins. Oh, my god!

527
00:25:33,441 --> 00:25:35,743
right away, doctor.
We can't wait for cardio. Crap!

528
00:25:35,777 --> 00:25:37,845
What the hell is going on?!
Brad-

529
00:25:37,912 --> 00:25:42,082
I need to open him up. Scalpel.
oh, my god. Oh, my god.

530
00:25:42,117 --> 00:25:44,151
get away from our son!

531
00:25:44,185 --> 00:25:47,087
Please leave!
Get away from our son!

532
00:25:47,122 --> 00:25:50,424
he's bradying down.

533
00:25:52,935 --> 00:25:55,036
More suction, please.

534
00:25:57,573 --> 00:26:00,675
there. I think I got it.

535
00:26:00,709 --> 00:26:02,844
Let me in. What happened? He put
out more than 2 liters of blood

536
00:26:02,878 --> 00:26:05,446
In the last five minutes,
but I think I found the source,

537
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:07,381
'cause the bleeding
started to calm down.

538
00:26:07,416 --> 00:26:09,717
All right. Jump on.
We're moving to the o.R.

539
00:26:09,752 --> 00:26:11,285
Page cristina yang.

540
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,154
right away, doctor.
Watch that line.

541
00:26:22,765 --> 00:26:24,265
No.
wait.

542
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:26,334
No. No.
Wait. Hang on. Hang on.

543
00:26:26,368 --> 00:26:28,236
Oh, it's-it's teddy.

544
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:30,171
So?
I- no, it's teddy.

545
00:26:30,205 --> 00:26:32,974
So? You're not on her service.
No, but I have to-

546
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:36,210
Don't go. Don't go. She has
another resident today.

547
00:26:36,245 --> 00:26:40,181
Stay here with me.

548
00:26:40,215 --> 00:26:42,283
Don't go.

549
00:26:42,317 --> 00:26:44,152
please.

550
00:26:58,333 --> 00:26:59,901
Oh. All right.

551
00:26:59,935 --> 00:27:01,903
What's going on?
How is he?

552
00:27:01,937 --> 00:27:03,504
He's critical.

553
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:06,140
He has a ruptured
aortic arch dissection.

554
00:27:06,175 --> 00:27:08,476
Hardly ever catch them,
but karev here

555
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:11,479
May have worked a little
miracle. Nice work, karev.

556
00:27:11,513 --> 00:27:14,081
Damn it.
Where the hell is yang?

557
00:27:14,116 --> 00:27:17,318
I need a second set of hands.
You want me to scrub in?

558
00:27:17,352 --> 00:27:19,320
dr. Altman,
I'm available.

559
00:27:19,354 --> 00:27:21,055
She's waiting for yang.

560
00:27:21,089 --> 00:27:23,991
Yeah, I know. Believe me,
I know I'm not cristina yang.

561
00:27:24,026 --> 00:27:26,027
Okay? You made that
perfectly clear today.

562
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:28,896
But if you give me a chance,
I have very good hands.

563
00:27:28,931 --> 00:27:30,832
I can do this.
Okay? I can help.

564
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:39,841
cannulate
the femoral artery and vein,

565
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:42,143
And then we're gonna
co him down fast.

566
00:27:42,177 --> 00:27:44,846
We have 30 minutes
to complete this repair

567
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,614
Or this patient is toast.

568
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,717
Bowel looks fine.

569
00:27:49,785 --> 00:27:52,420
Okay, just check
the anastomosis and keep going.

570
00:27:52,454 --> 00:27:54,488
Everything still good?

571
00:27:54,523 --> 00:27:57,925
B.P.'s stable,
bis level's 45.

572
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,862
She's sound asleep, just like
the last time you asked

573
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,330
Two minutes ago.

574
00:28:02,364 --> 00:28:04,732
Anastomosis oks clean.
Bowel's intact.

575
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,101
Good. Get a new mesh.
Oh, and, uh, so you know,

576
00:28:07,135 --> 00:28:08,903
I don't read
"architectural digest"

577
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,938
In the o.R.

578
00:28:10,973 --> 00:28:13,040
No, that, uh, magazine
I read earlier?

579
00:28:13,075 --> 00:28:15,309
That was the "journal
of clinical anesthesia,"

580
00:28:15,344 --> 00:28:18,246
In case you were wondering.
I wasn't.

581
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,249
Ready for the mesh. Suture, please.
Okay, get a good bite of fascia.

582
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:24,118
I actually don't like
the sitting down part of my job.

583
00:28:24,152 --> 00:28:25,920
It's not great for the back,

584
00:28:25,988 --> 00:28:28,556
You know, and, uh,
I like to keep in shape

585
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:31,259
So I can lift
my big buckets of money.

586
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:33,961
I yell when I'm scared.

587
00:28:33,996 --> 00:28:37,832
Some people whimper or duck.
I yell.

588
00:28:37,866 --> 00:28:39,700
When she woke up, it was

589
00:28:39,735 --> 00:28:42,570
One of the scariest moments
of my life, so I yelled,

590
00:28:42,604 --> 00:28:45,006
And then I yelled some more.

591
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,575
It's what I do.

592
00:28:47,609 --> 00:28:49,377
Was that an apology?

593
00:28:49,411 --> 00:28:51,913
Closest thing
you're gonna get.

594
00:29:00,821 --> 00:29:03,657
Hey.

595
00:29:03,691 --> 00:29:06,026
Ooh. Nice skin graft.

596
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,861
Thank you.

597
00:29:07,895 --> 00:29:10,764
So I was talking to lexie-
wh-why?

598
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:12,632
When? Why are you
talking to her?

599
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:15,535
No, she came to me. And actually, she
- don't do this.

600
00:29:15,569 --> 00:29:18,405
You're my friend, not hers. Don't
take her side. I'm not picking sides.

601
00:29:18,439 --> 00:29:20,874
I'm just saying,
she made some good points.

602
00:29:20,908 --> 00:29:23,243
She dumped me and jumped
into bed with karev.

603
00:29:23,277 --> 00:29:26,513
She doesn't get to make good points. Mark,
don't you think you're being a little...

604
00:29:26,547 --> 00:29:30,216
What, mad, offended, disgusted?
Hypocritical, sexist, immature?

605
00:29:30,251 --> 00:29:32,185
She dumped me!

606
00:29:32,219 --> 00:29:33,553
Not the other way around.

607
00:29:33,587 --> 00:29:36,723
She dumped me, and for wanting
to step up

608
00:29:36,757 --> 00:29:40,160
And be responsible
with my own daughter.

609
00:29:40,194 --> 00:29:42,595
You know how big a step
that is for me.

610
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:45,432
D you know how much I wanted
to take that step with lexie.

611
00:29:45,466 --> 00:29:47,434
I'm not the one
who's immature!

612
00:29:47,468 --> 00:29:51,137
And you made me wreck
my skin graft!

613
00:30:02,149 --> 00:30:03,950
Leslie's out of surgery.

614
00:30:03,985 --> 00:30:05,352
How'd the repair go?

615
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:07,287
Oh, just fine.
No complications.

616
00:30:07,321 --> 00:30:09,322
Meredith did
an excellent job.

617
00:30:09,357 --> 00:30:10,824
Good. That's good.

618
00:30:10,858 --> 00:30:12,225
Good news.

619
00:30:12,259 --> 00:30:14,661
How's the lawyer?

620
00:30:14,695 --> 00:30:16,730
lawyer's still here, drooling.

621
00:30:16,764 --> 00:30:19,332
Oh, damn it. Damn it.

622
00:30:19,367 --> 00:30:23,203
Tough first day, chief?

623
00:30:23,237 --> 00:30:25,138
tough first day.

624
00:30:25,172 --> 00:30:27,307
You know,
nine times out of ten,

625
00:30:27,341 --> 00:30:29,342
You can make a lawsuit
go away

626
00:30:29,377 --> 00:30:32,846
If you apologize.

627
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,848
People like to feel heard.

628
00:30:34,882 --> 00:30:36,750
They like to feel respected.

629
00:30:36,784 --> 00:30:39,352
And they like to hear
an apology.

630
00:30:39,387 --> 00:30:41,287
That's what chief webber
would do.

631
00:30:41,322 --> 00:30:43,256
He'd walk right into
that woman's room

632
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:45,191
The minute
she got out of recovery,

633
00:30:45,226 --> 00:30:47,560
And he'd apologize.

634
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:51,531
Oh, dr. Altman.

635
00:30:51,565 --> 00:30:54,067
When I page you,
I expect an answer.

636
00:30:54,101 --> 00:30:56,069
I know. I-'m sorry.
I was just, uh-

637
00:30:56,103 --> 00:30:58,538
I had a ruptured
aortic arch dissection,

638
00:30:58,572 --> 00:31:00,573
And I thought that-
an aortic arch dissection?

639
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,542
I thought at the very least,

640
00:31:02,576 --> 00:31:05,578
I could rely on you
to act professionally.

641
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:07,380
Everything okay?

642
00:31:07,415 --> 00:31:10,350
Uh, uh, dr. Altman,
I'm sorry. You're right.

643
00:31:10,384 --> 00:31:11,818
It won't happen again.

644
00:31:11,852 --> 00:31:13,753
I should've responded
to your page.

645
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:15,622
No, wait. I...
This wasn't cristina's fault.

646
00:31:15,656 --> 00:31:18,458
I detained her for a
trauma thing. Oh, really?

647
00:31:18,492 --> 00:31:21,761
<i>Now you have something
to say to me? You know what?</i>

648
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:24,697
Forget it.

649
00:31:29,837 --> 00:31:31,082
What?

650
00:31:31,295 --> 00:31:34,324
What are you trying
to do to me? I'm-

651
00:31:34,342 --> 00:31:35,424
Cristina, I'm...

652
00:31:39,495 --> 00:31:41,762
Oh, come on.

653
00:31:45,043 --> 00:31:48,464
His heart ruptured? This is
unbelievable. How could you not find this?

654
00:31:48,499 --> 00:31:50,641
Well, his heart symptoms
presented as abdominal pains,

655
00:31:50,676 --> 00:31:52,401
Which is
an extremely rare presentation.

656
00:31:52,436 --> 00:31:54,513
It's almost impossible
to diagnose.

657
00:31:54,548 --> 00:31:57,784
But the most important thing
is that brad is doing fine.

658
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:00,644
Fine? You call him being
hooked up to tubes and...

659
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:01,858
You call that "fine"?

660
00:32:01,893 --> 00:32:04,384
Dude, seriously, we're the only
reason your kid's alive. Okay, karev-

661
00:32:04,419 --> 00:32:06,330
If you'd had it your way,
you'd have been home

662
00:32:06,364 --> 00:32:08,565
When brad's aorta ruptured,
and he'd be dead right now.

663
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:11,802
Think about how much school he'd be missing
then, huh? Karev! We're done here. Excuse me.

664
00:32:11,836 --> 00:32:14,104
Follow me right now.

665
00:32:25,482 --> 00:32:27,716
Go away. Please, bailey.

666
00:32:27,751 --> 00:32:30,219
I don't want you
to see me like this.

667
00:32:30,253 --> 00:32:32,287
Uh, all due respect,
chief,

668
00:32:32,322 --> 00:32:34,590
Everybody's been seeing you
like tall day.

669
00:32:34,624 --> 00:32:36,058
I don't know details.

670
00:32:36,092 --> 00:32:37,893
I don't know
what's going on with you,

671
00:32:37,927 --> 00:32:41,330
But you can't sit here anymore,
not like this.

672
00:32:41,364 --> 00:32:43,198
I can't give them this.

673
00:32:43,233 --> 00:32:45,868
Shepherd, jennings-

674
00:32:45,902 --> 00:32:48,203
If I do
what they want me to do,

675
00:32:48,238 --> 00:32:51,006
It's like saying
that they were right,

676
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,775
Right about doing this,

677
00:32:52,809 --> 00:32:54,376
Right about me.

678
00:32:54,411 --> 00:32:56,345
Saying they were right
about what?

679
00:32:58,281 --> 00:33:00,949
They want me to say
I'm an alcoholic.

680
00:33:05,088 --> 00:33:07,689
Well, are you an alcoholic?

681
00:33:07,724 --> 00:33:10,359
Yes.

682
00:33:10,393 --> 00:33:13,562
But if I sign these papers,

683
00:33:13,596 --> 00:33:15,964
Then I have to stop drinking

684
00:33:15,999 --> 00:33:18,434
And go to rehab.

685
00:33:18,468 --> 00:33:21,336
And I don't think
I'm ready to do that.

686
00:33:23,306 --> 00:33:24,807
Drinking...

687
00:33:24,841 --> 00:33:29,211
Feels a little bit
like all I have left.

688
00:33:29,245 --> 00:33:31,146
You are better than this.

689
00:33:31,181 --> 00:33:33,048
I've seen you be better.

690
00:33:33,082 --> 00:33:36,018
Look, the way to win,
the way to beat them,

691
00:33:36,052 --> 00:33:37,853
Is to stop fighting them.

692
00:33:37,887 --> 00:33:39,822
<i>You go get better.</i>

693
00:33:39,856 --> 00:33:43,058
<i>You be the man that I've
always known you to be.</i>

694
00:33:43,092 --> 00:33:45,894
You be the chief.

695
00:33:49,365 --> 00:33:51,400
Be the chief.

696
00:33:55,772 --> 00:33:58,874
If you want to work in peds,
you can't get emotional.

697
00:33:58,908 --> 00:34:01,343
You said it was part of the
job. No, no. There's a difference

698
00:34:01,377 --> 00:34:03,111
Between advocating
for tiny humans

699
00:34:03,146 --> 00:34:04,680
And berating
terrified parents.

700
00:34:04,714 --> 00:34:06,682
You're good with kids.
I can see that.

701
00:34:06,716 --> 00:34:08,617
You've got great hands
and great instincts.

702
00:34:08,651 --> 00:34:09,514
We already knew that.

703
00:34:09,753 --> 00:34:10,926
And you're as good
as anyone I've seen

704
00:34:10,926 --> 00:34:12,447
When it comes to advocating
for your patients.

705
00:34:12,447 --> 00:34:13,857
But until you've been a parent,

706
00:34:13,857 --> 00:34:16,575
Until you've stayed up nights
with a screaming infant

707
00:34:16,575 --> 00:34:19,962
Or dealt day in and day out
with a terrorist toddler

708
00:34:19,997 --> 00:34:22,865
Or raised a lying teenager,
you don't get to judge parents.

709
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,867
You have to advocate
for the kids.

710
00:34:24,935 --> 00:34:26,769
You don't get to berate
terrified parents.

711
00:34:26,804 --> 00:34:29,405
You clear on that?
Yes.

712
00:34:29,439 --> 00:34:33,142
Good. Then you go apologize
to that family.

713
00:34:35,345 --> 00:34:36,345
Good. Then you go apologize
karev.To that family.

714
00:34:38,615 --> 00:34:41,784
You saved
that kid's life today.

715
00:34:46,123 --> 00:34:48,357
It feels great.

716
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,461
Hard-core, right?

717
00:34:52,495 --> 00:34:54,129
yeah.

718
00:34:54,164 --> 00:34:56,165
Welcome to peds.

719
00:35:08,845 --> 00:35:11,747
hi.
I know it's been a long day,

720
00:35:11,781 --> 00:35:13,916
And you're all anxious
to get home.

721
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:16,385
But I feel like we got off
on the wrong foot this morning.

722
00:35:18,922 --> 00:35:21,624
I don't expect to win
your trust overnight.

723
00:35:21,658 --> 00:35:24,460
But I want each of you
to know...

724
00:35:24,494 --> 00:35:26,195
You have mine.

725
00:35:27,998 --> 00:35:29,999
Which is why I felt
it was important

726
00:35:30,033 --> 00:35:36,472
To personally come in here
and, uh, apologize.

727
00:35:36,506 --> 00:35:39,575
Mrs. Wilson,
do you have a moment?

728
00:35:41,211 --> 00:35:43,312
I want to clear
some things up.

729
00:35:43,346 --> 00:35:47,349
I'd like to offer each of you
your jobs back.

730
00:35:47,384 --> 00:35:50,219
Now there are gonna be cuts
down the line,

731
00:35:50,287 --> 00:35:52,988
But you both deserve a
fighting chance. Oh, my god.

732
00:35:53,023 --> 00:35:54,890
Thank you.
Dr. Shepherd, thank you.

733
00:35:54,924 --> 00:35:56,959
Thank you.

734
00:35:56,993 --> 00:35:58,861
<i>I am neither pro
nor anti merger.</i>

735
00:35:58,895 --> 00:36:01,964
<i>From this point on,
everyone has a clean slate.</i>

736
00:36:25,488 --> 00:36:27,456
<i>I am not focused on the past.</i>

737
00:36:53,182 --> 00:36:56,051
I'm trying
to understand you.

738
00:36:56,452 --> 00:37:00,455
You've been trying
to screw me into submissio

739
00:37:00,089 --> 00:37:02,991
I was not. You've been trying to
screw me into submission,rstand you.

740
00:37:03,026 --> 00:37:05,994
And I let you,
because the sex was so good

741
00:37:06,029 --> 00:37:09,064
And your ego was hurt. I am trying.
I am trying to understand you.

742
00:37:09,098 --> 00:37:11,266
I am trying to know you.

743
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,168
I am trying to... Love you,

744
00:37:13,202 --> 00:37:14,569
And I don't know how.

745
00:37:14,604 --> 00:37:17,305
I don't know how 'cause you
don't give me anything.

746
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:20,142
Oh, so the-the vent burn
was, uh, you branding me,

747
00:37:20,176 --> 00:37:23,111
Like I'm
- like I'm chattel? I'm trying! Damn it.

748
00:37:24,814 --> 00:37:27,182
I don't know you.
I don't know you

749
00:37:27,216 --> 00:37:29,951
'cause you don't give me
anything. I give you everything.

750
00:37:29,986 --> 00:37:32,187
Burke.
What?

751
00:37:32,221 --> 00:37:34,189
Burke. Preston burke.
You were engaged.

752
00:37:34,223 --> 00:37:36,758
There was almost a wedding.
Why didn't that happen?

753
00:37:36,793 --> 00:37:39,294
No. No, I'm not-
we're not doing this.

754
00:37:39,328 --> 00:37:42,130
You see? You give me nothing.
Maybe...

755
00:37:42,165 --> 00:37:44,533
Maybe I was trying to
screw you into submission.

756
00:37:44,567 --> 00:37:46,968
Maybe I was trying to...
Connect.

757
00:37:47,003 --> 00:37:48,470
I'll try anything.

758
00:37:48,504 --> 00:37:51,907
I'll try anything, but you have
to give me something back.

759
00:37:51,941 --> 00:37:53,909
Well, burke is irrelevant.

760
00:37:53,943 --> 00:37:57,245
Oh, yeah. Like I'll be
in three years' time.

761
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,847
That's not fair.

762
00:37:58,881 --> 00:38:02,284
I'm trying to love you.
Why won't you let me?

763
00:38:04,687 --> 00:38:06,855
Burke...

764
00:38:10,993 --> 00:38:13,995
Burke was, uh...

765
00:38:17,767 --> 00:38:21,670
He took something from me.

766
00:38:21,704 --> 00:38:25,073
He took little pieces
of me...

767
00:38:25,108 --> 00:38:27,008
Little pieces over time,

768
00:38:27,043 --> 00:38:28,910
So small, I didn't notice,
you know?

769
00:38:28,945 --> 00:38:32,280
He wanted me to be
something I wasn't,

770
00:38:32,315 --> 00:38:35,917
And I made myself
into what he wanted.

771
00:38:35,952 --> 00:38:37,886
One day I was me-
cristina yang.

772
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,722
And then suddenly I was
lying for him

773
00:38:40,757 --> 00:38:42,791
And, uh,
jeopardizing my career

774
00:38:42,825 --> 00:38:45,494
And, uh,
agreeing to be married

775
00:38:45,528 --> 00:38:48,463
And wearing a ring
and being a bride...

776
00:38:48,498 --> 00:38:51,199
Until I was standing there...

777
00:38:51,234 --> 00:38:53,201
In a wedding dress
with no eyebrows,

778
00:38:53,236 --> 00:38:56,271
And I wasn't
cristina yang anymore.

779
00:38:56,305 --> 00:38:58,740
And even then,
I would've married him.

780
00:38:58,775 --> 00:39:00,909
I would have.

781
00:39:00,943 --> 00:39:05,580
I lost myself
for a long time.

782
00:39:05,648 --> 00:39:08,283
And now...

783
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:14,656
That I'm finally me again...

784
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:16,591
I can't...

785
00:39:18,394 --> 00:39:21,296
I love you. I love you
more than I loved burke.

786
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:22,764
I love you.

787
00:39:22,799 --> 00:39:25,333
And that scares
the crap out of me

788
00:39:25,368 --> 00:39:28,403
Because...

789
00:39:28,437 --> 00:39:32,941
When you asked me
to ignore teddy's page,

790
00:39:32,975 --> 00:39:37,479
You took a piece of me...

791
00:39:37,513 --> 00:39:40,949
And I let you.

792
00:39:43,419 --> 00:39:45,420
And...

793
00:39:48,057 --> 00:39:55,197
that will never happen... Again.

794
00:40:01,938 --> 00:40:05,173
<i>I'm looking to the future...</i>

795
00:40:07,476 --> 00:40:08,977
You feel better?

796
00:40:09,011 --> 00:40:10,412
A little.

797
00:40:14,217 --> 00:40:16,852
This really isn't
gonna work for me.

798
00:40:16,886 --> 00:40:21,156
<i>To all the promise
this hospital has to offer.</i>

799
00:40:41,077 --> 00:40:43,311
<i>I plan
to honorhard webber</i>

800
00:40:43,346 --> 00:40:45,313
<i>And his legacy,</i>

801
00:40:45,348 --> 00:40:48,750
<i>Not undo it...</i>

802
00:40:48,784 --> 00:40:51,686
Thank you, richard.

803
00:40:54,624 --> 00:40:57,692
I'm sorry.

804
00:41:06,335 --> 00:41:10,038
<i>Which is why I'm both humbled
and honored...</i>

805
00:41:10,072 --> 00:41:12,540
<i>To be
your new chief of surgery.</i>
