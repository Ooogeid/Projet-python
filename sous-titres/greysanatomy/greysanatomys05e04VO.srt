1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:02,260
Previously on "grey's anatomy"...

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:03,890
I had a bad night and I cried like a girl.

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,130
I'm over it. You need to get over it, too.

4
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:09,360
I'm retaking my intern test. You and I are more than just roommates.

5
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:10,910
Yeah, we're friends. I mean, right now, you're probably

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,260
One of my best friends. Best friends.

7
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:17,340
You're the only woman I've ever kissed. So you're freaking out, too?

8
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,980
A lot of therapy time. Well, Derek's moved in.

9
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:21,320
And we've taken it to the next level.

10
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:22,870
I am happy.

11
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,730
In 6500 b.C.,

12
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,130
Some guy looked at his sick friend and said,

13
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,140
"i have an idea. Why don't I drill a hole in your skull?

14
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,530
It'll make you feel better."

15
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,770
And thus, surgery was born.

16
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,720
Uh, where's Mer?

17
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:46,670
She's not here.

18
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,350
So you're just in there by yourself?

19
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,550
I'm not... I'm--i'm waiting for her.

20
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,230
Oh. Love the outfit.

21
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,130
What do you want? I need cash.

22
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,180
I ordered a pizza, and Alex owes me 20 bucks,

23
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:02,990
But he's not speaking to me because I saw him crying

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,200
Over his crazy girlfriend.

25
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,720
And there was a minute a week ago

26
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,970
That I actually thought he was gonna be a human being,

27
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:12,850
And now he won open the door. Run into the bathroom. Just go. Go!

28
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:14,920
Karev.

29
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,050
Give me a $20.

30
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,920
That was so awesome. You're pretty cool.

31
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:27,440
Not that I didn't think you were cool before,

32
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,200
But, you know, I did not.

33
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:31,620
I kinda just thought you were all hair and, you know. Ah.

34
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,650
Now, cool. You want to share some pizza?

35
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:38,780
It takes a certain brand of crazy

36
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:39,310
To come up with an idea

37
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,360
Like drilling into somebody's skull.

38
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:44,460
But surgeons have always been a confident bunch.

39
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,320
Unh-unh-unh. Your clothes, your room.

40
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:47,440
The living room will not be a dumping ground

41
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:48,990
Like the old place was.

42
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,070
Did you not hear her?

43
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,200
Okay. She kinda scares me.

44
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:00,590
'cause she's scary.

45
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,620
Callie needs a new best friend.

46
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:05,230
Not bad, right?

47
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,450
It great.

48
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,800
We usually know what we're doing,

49
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,990
And when we don't, we still act like we do.

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,280
We walk boldly into undiscovered country,

51
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,660
Plant a flag and start ordering people around.

52
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,290
Do you want to go on a date with me?

53
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,180
It's invigorating and terrifying.

54
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,270
Like a "date" date?

55
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,150
Yeah, you know, a restaurant candlelight, bottle of wine--

56
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,060
At the end of the night, I try to take your clothes off?

57
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:31,640
Ooh. Okay, that's... That would be a date.

58
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,260
Hey. You're...

59
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,830
Naked and waiting for you.

60
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,570
You keep a diary?

61
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,130
Have I not known that all this time,

62
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,660
That you keep a diary? No, i-i-i don't.

63
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:53,480
I, uh--

64
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:56,710
Aw, don't be shy. I think it's cute.

65
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,440
It's not mine.

66
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,620
I won't read it. Whose is it?

67
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,860
Your mother's.

68
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,450
It was in a big box full of old issues

69
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,490
Of "the new england journal of medicine."

70
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,520
Did you read it?

71
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,040
No.

72
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,440
I brought it up here for you.

73
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,790
Why were you going through her things?

74
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,900
I was trying to find space for my clothes.

75
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,480
Your closet is full.

76
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:30,400
I have to, um, shower.

77
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,350
I've been hauling Cristina's boxes.

78
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,410
You haven't read any of it? No, what if I'm in it?

79
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,800
I don't want to hear what she thought of me.

80
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,010
I've heard enough of that already.

81
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,540
What's worse, if you're in it or you're not in it

82
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:51,700
I don't know. But I mean, see, why is he in the study

83
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,030
Rooting around in closets...

84
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,610
Trying to dig up my mother's ghost?

85
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,370
I think 'cause you invited him.

86
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,580
Apparently some people thought I was kidding last week

87
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:02,840
When I announced that nobody was going to get to Hang out

88
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,680
On their favorite specialty anymore.

89
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:09,560
I wasn't. Junior residents don't specialize.

90
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,410
So all the requests to send you back

91
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,440
To that place where your true heart lives can end now.

92
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,180
Dr. Bailey makes the assignments.

93
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,690
Do not, and I repeat, do not harangue her.

94
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,830
Look, O'malley, I made a call.

95
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,310
They don't have your score yet. If I knew, I would tell you.

96
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,660
You passed.

97
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,560
We're gonna go to Joe's tonight and we're gonna celebrate.

98
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:41,740
I'm gonna buy you a beer

99
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,760
And all the peanuts you can eat.

100
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:48,300
What if I didn't pass? Well, then I'm still buying you a beer.

101
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,470
Beer for losers.

102
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:53,020
Grey, you're on cardio with Hahn today.

103
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:55,390
Oh, but-- Stevens and Karev, pit.

104
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,920
Oh, come on. That's not--the chief wants us to have a change.

105
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,750
That's not a change. I'm always stuck in the pit with Alex.

106
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,100
When the chief said don't harangue dr. Bailey,

107
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:05,040
What do you think he meant? Yang, clinic.

108
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,350
What? What? No. No. No, no, wait, wait.

109
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,550
The clinic is mine. I say how it's staffed. Yeah, yeah.

110
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,030
She'll just ruin it. Yeah, I will. I'll-i'll ruin it.

111
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,990
Just let me do it. No, you will not. You will do what I say.

112
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,850
And since Yang couldn't be bothered to show up

113
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,180
At the clinic since it opened,

114
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:20,130
Think of it as a new frontier in her training.

115
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,290
Sorry. Oh, oh, oh, my god. You're totally not sorry.

116
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,280
You're psyched. You got Hahn.

117
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,410
If you're not, you should be. Well, she's terrifying

118
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,240
And you have given her

119
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,750
Unrealistic expectations as to what a resident should know.

120
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,530
Just stay on top of the material, and don't get

121
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,420
All warm and fuzzy with okay.

122
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,690
If you have any questions, just come and ask me.

123
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,340
I'll be in the clinic putting band-aids on stupid whiners

124
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,340
Who don't have the balls to get real injuries.

125
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,740
One through four, let's go. Come on.

126
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,900
I didn't read the diary.

127
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,320
I just found it and put it on the table.

128
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,630
I would've read it.

129
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,640
Every time I actually do something

130
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,950
To move into the house, she freaks out.

131
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,020
What are you gonna do with the trailer?

132
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,070
No.

133
00:05:59,090 --> 00:05:59,980
Come on.

134
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,360
'cause there's a very real possibility

135
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,910
She kicks me out in a week.

136
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,570
I'm not letting go of the trailer.

137
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,370
Sutures, fecal impaction and more sutures.

138
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,660
She'll do it. What do you mean, she'll do it?

139
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,720
You're good at boring, stupid crap.

140
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,130
You're like a specialist.

141
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,690
Hi, I'm dr. Stevens.

142
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,910
Looks like you need some stitches. What happened?

143
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,340
I have a cut.

144
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,490
How'd you get it?

145
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,420
I threw a remote at him, okay? It's no big secret.

146
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,680
I threw it at him because all he can do is watch television

147
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,110
Or fall asleep like a dead person. Honey--

148
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,280
Don't "honey" me. I'm divorcing you.

149
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,160
As soon as you stop bleeding from your head,

150
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,420
We're going to a lawyer.

151
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,720
You ever been to europe?

152
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,490
Nope. Someday. Don't wait until you're retired

153
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,790
And you can't be bothered to look out the window.

154
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,860
6-month trip across the world--

155
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,890
I've been waiting for it for 15 years--

156
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,990
He slept through the whole thing. Marianne--

157
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,530
Six continents.

158
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,570
I worked for 30 years. I was very tired.

159
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,990
Well, I'm tired, too,

160
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,380
Of being married to somebody with no interest in the world,

161
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:03,850
So everybody's tired. I'm gonna go get some coffee.

162
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,410
I assume this is going to take forever. Probably.

163
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,310
Does your mouth always do that, move to the side like that?

164
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,840
Like what? Huh.

165
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,740
Mind if I run some tests?

166
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,540
Whatever you want. Great.

167
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,860
I may be wrong about this, but I think mr. Grandy

168
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:29,990
Has a major neuro thing going on.

169
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,360
So get him stitched up and then get him up for a c.T., okay? Okay.

170
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,550
Oh, give me that.

171
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:37,440
Give it.

172
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,990
Mr. Grandy, uh, I'm dr. Karev,

173
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,710
And I will be taking you up for your c.T. Today.

174
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,350
Duncan Paley, age 8, recently diagnosed

175
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:50,310
With aortic valve disease from an infectious endocarditis.

176
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,080
He's scheduled for a ross procedure today.

177
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,350
There's a note from his pediatrician-- Duncan!

178
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,110
Duncan, get back here. Duncan!

179
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,450
Stop him. Grab him.

180
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:02,350
Go.

181
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,490
Sorry. Duncan.

182
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,560
Duncan. Duncan, come back here.

183
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,460
Duncan, you get down from there right n.

184
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,430
No, do not. Don't touch the fire alarm.

185
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,200
Do not pull that. I'm not having surgery.

186
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:18,500
I'm not doing it. One, two-- counting doesn't work.

187
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,630
I think this is all gonna be okay if we just-- promise me no surgery.

188
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,780
Promise me no surgery.

189
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,030
O--i--we--

190
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,800
We can't really do that.

191
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,610
Evacuate. Evacuate.

192
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,610
Evacuate.

193
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,860
This is an emergency.

194
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,650
Evacuate.

195
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:50,580
Do we have this kid under control,

196
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:52,530
Or do I have to call social services?

197
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,130
He won't do anything like that again.

198
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,480
He'd better not. The damn ceiling fell last week

199
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,290
I don't need a series of false alarms.

200
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,670
This place looks ridiculous enough already.

201
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,980
Keep the ankle biter under control.

202
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,290
I'll sedate him if I have to.

203
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,640
Good, and bone up on your pulmonary autografts.

204
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,750
I don't want to spend the day bathed in your ignorance

205
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,490
As well as your incompetence.

206
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,970
Oh, she hates me. What do you mean, we'll sedate him if we have to?

207
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,070
I was just trying not to be warm and fuzzy.

208
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,600
I don't mean sedate him, I just mean babysit him.

209
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,570
It's your last day as an intern.

210
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,620
Just think of how happy you'll be to move on.

211
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,990
I'm gonna be in the o.R. Till 7:00.

212
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,600
Is 8:00 too late for dinner?

213
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,930
No, but if you need to reschedule or cancel--

214
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,190
Come on. Are you kidding?

215
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,640
I made a reservation at canto.

216
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,780
I even gamed out an outfit.

217
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,740
We are doing this.

218
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,690
So Hahn is doing a ross procedure,

219
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,970
And she thinks I'm a moron. Well,

220
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,970
First of all, it's called a pulmonary autograft

221
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,790
She likes the technical names. Okay, tell her you're excited

222
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,250
To watch her harvest the pulmonary valv

223
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,990
Using her septal-sparing technique.

224
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,740
If you cut too much of the septal muscle,

225
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,860
The patient won't be able to come off pump. None of that is in the book.

226
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,580
It's the key to the case. It'll make you sound like

227
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:07,140
You've been around the block once or twice. Perfect.

228
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,670
I can't believe I am giving you all my best stuff. Mwah!

229
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,900
You totally don't deserve it. Uh, dr. Yang.

230
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,920
Mrs. Borsokowski needs your loving attention.

231
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:18,020
Redness, itching, inflammation--a rash.

232
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,320
You're giving me a rash?

233
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:22,320
No, she's the mean one. I don't want her.

234
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,750
O-okay.

235
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,000
All right. What do we got?

236
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,680
Take a look. The thing's bigger than a baseball.

237
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,160
Oh, wow. It's right behind his eyes.

238
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,230
This should be fun. Page Stevens.

239
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,780
She left the guy with me.

240
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,560
She gave you the case?

241
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,900
Yeah, well, Izzie felt bad for me.

242
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,850
You know, figured this would cheer me up.

243
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,990
In that case, you're gonna help me pull this thing out.

244
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:47,990
Hey, Duncan.

245
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,420
We're gonna put an i.V. In your arm real quick,

246
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:53,990
And then you can go back to your playing, okay? What is it?

247
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,930
Oh, it's a little tube we put in your arm. No.

248
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:58,120
Duncan-- no, it's gonna hurt.

249
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:00,850
Come on, kiddo. It's not gonna hurt. No, it's gonna hurt.

250
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,500
It's a needle. It's gonna hurt.

251
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:06,290
But it's only for, what, three seconds?

252
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,890
I don't believe you.

253
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,940
You don't believe me?

254
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,240
What, do you want me to prove it to you?

255
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,830
I'll prove it. I'll have dr. Grey put one in me.

256
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:16,510
This is a tourniquet,

257
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,630
And, uh, you wrap it around your arm

258
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,680
So that your vein pops out.

259
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,300
See? Like that?

260
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,250
So now the needle--

261
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,860
That's the part that's gonna hurt.

262
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,210
That goes in,

263
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,830
And that's--yeah.

264
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,860
Hurting. That hurts.

265
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,100
It hurts and...

266
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,970
It doesn't huranymore.

267
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:44,550
And now that stuff goes into here.

268
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,200
Doesn't hurt at all.

269
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,630
Okay, I'll do it.

270
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,280
Okay. Then I'll go get another i.V. Kit.

271
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:56,330
Okay. Okay.

272
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,000
You're really good at this.

273
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,310
Oh, I was an airplane guy, too, when I was his age.

274
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,660
Us airplane guys,

275
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,390
I think we just like to know how things work.

276
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,970
I'm sorry about the alarm.

277
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,870
Oh, I know.

278
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:20,620
Move!

279
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,230
They have the nerve to be indignant

280
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,860
About how they're not allowed

281
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:27,950
To be on their specialties anymore.

282
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,060
They don't have specialties.

283
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,350
They should be grateful they're even allowed in the--

284
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,840
Are you listening to me?

285
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:39,500
I'm going on a date with Erica Hahn.

286
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:42,110
And, uh, that's awkward

287
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,610
'cause, uh...

288
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,330
She's a colleague and because she's an attending

289
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,960
And because she's a she.

290
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,720
And, uh, there's been kissing,

291
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,520
But, uh, no touching.

292
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:54,880
And what if I'm not intot?

293
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:56,860
What--what if-- what if I'm horrible

294
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:59,510
At all that stuff... South...

295
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:01,770
Of the border?

296
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,000
'cause I've never been south of the border

297
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,060
With a female.

298
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,250
I mean, i--i've never even been over the, uh,

299
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:11,070
Northern mountains, you know what I'm saying?

300
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,230
We're gonna pretend this didn't happen.

301
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:28,130
Mr. Grandy? What are you doing in here?

302
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:30,310
They admitted me.

303
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,600
My new doctor, dr. Karev,

304
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,790
Said I have a huge tumor in my head.

305
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,040
Have you seen my wife?

306
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,830
Your new doctor?

307
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,840
Somebody paged me?

308
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,100
Oh, I have a patient with tenderness and erythema

309
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:47,040
Extending from her upper chest to her left arm.

310
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:49,410
I'm thinking she needs irrigation and debridement.

311
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,290
She said you may have to amputate my arm.

312
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,070
No. That's a simple rash.

313
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,870
It's not a flesh-eating bacteria.

314
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,800
It's probably dermatitis. No, no, no, but look how the skin is denuded.

315
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,090
It could be surgical, right? It's possible-- it's

316
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,410
A rash. If it's dry, wet it. If it's wet, dry it

317
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,370
Go to derm, get a tube of cerave cream,

318
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,690
And don't ever page me to hustle a surgery again.

319
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,000
It was supposed to be done yesterday, done.

320
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,260
So exactly why did I walk into my o.R.

321
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,110
And still see a massive, gaping hole

322
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,140
In where the ceiling was supposed to be?

323
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:17,090
If you see Karev, get an 18-gauge needle

324
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,350
And shove it in his throat. I have cultivated a look

325
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,890
That says I'm not interested in your personal problems.

326
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,310
Can you morons not read that look,

327
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,490
Or have I lost the Hang of it? Because people are telling me

328
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,870
A lot of personal problems today.

329
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,660
I don't give a crap about your crushing workload

330
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:31,010
Or your baffling love life or your carpal tunnel syndrome.

331
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,660
All I care about is mrs. Carrucci,

332
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,900
A 92-year-old woman who no one can seem to find.

333
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,190
Hi.

334
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,360
I'm dr. Pepman. Can I help you?

335
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,190
Uh, yeah, um,

336
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,730
Where can I get some cerave cream?

337
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:50,930
Um, our nurses look like they're tied up,

338
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,470
But if you don't mind waiting, I can get it for you myself.

339
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,350
Would you like some water with raspberries while you wait?

340
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,110
Uh, yeah, sure.

341
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:02,540
Hi, Chris.

342
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,830
Oh, don't mind Chris.

343
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,630
He's our massage therapist.

344
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,750
Your... Uh, what?

345
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:13,950
Our Hands do such delicate work,

346
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,450
It's important that they stay healthy.

347
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,490
So we have Chris on staff to work on us

348
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,010
When we have a spare moment.

349
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:23,840
Um... Every attending gets their Hands massaged at work?

350
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:24,410
Oh, no.

351
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,740
The dermatology attendings have another therapist.

352
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,550
Chris just works on the residents.

353
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:32,560
You're a resent?

354
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,740
First year,

355
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,040
And loving it.

356
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,910
Crack off his forehead.

357
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:44,850
Pull the tumour right out.

358
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,200
Close to his optic nerve.

359
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,500
Somebody twitches, and this guy's blind.

360
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:53,450
Which one of your roommates will be assisting? Karev.

361
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,860
Oh, great.

362
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:57,500
Dr. Shepherd, I want back on this case. Mm-hmm.

363
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,630
This is my patient. Alex stole him from me.

364
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,830
Remember when I was telling you that-- dr. Stevens, let's be clear.

365
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,340
In this hospital, I am not your roommate.

366
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,080
I don't give a crap about your personal problems.

367
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,590
I have a resident. I don't need another one. Dr. Shepherd.

368
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,900
Yes? Patient's in his room

369
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,880
If you want to go over the procedure with him. Great.

370
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,450
You son of a bitch.

371
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,110
Go cry to somebody who cares.

372
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,130
This is my case. It isn't fair.

373
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,450
Surgery's like the wild West.

374
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,850
You didn't get your claim in montana from the bank.

375
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,220
You got it 'cause you put a fence around it

376
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,680
And shot the ass off anyone who walked by.

377
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,030
Karev's a cowboy. You're not.

378
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,370
We're gonna transect the great arteries

379
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,800
At the sinotubular ridge,

380
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:43,370
Use the autograft to replace the aortic root,

381
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,590
And then attach a pulmonary homograft.

382
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,420
Are you going to use the septal-sparing technique

383
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:50,400
For the pulmonary autograft? Yes, why do you ask?

384
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,540
Well, because if we cut too much of the septal muscle,

385
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,970
We won't be able to take the patient off pump, right?

386
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:55,720
Right.

387
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:58,080
Great. I've always wanted to see a septal-sparing technique.

388
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:00,310
Do you know how to reanastomose the coronary arteries

389
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,380
Back on to the aorta? I do.

390
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,250
Hmm. Well, I'll let you sew part of it in.

391
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,770
Gonna be in there. Might as well get your Hands dirty.

392
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,850
Great. Thanks, dr. Hahn.

393
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,890
You're going to hell 'cause you're a liar.

394
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,850
Was it obvious?

395
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,850
Unfortunately, no.

396
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,040
What?

397
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,770
What happened? Look.

398
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,860
You paged me 9-1-1.

399
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,220
I'm in the middle of studying for Hahn's pulmonary autograft,

400
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:59,190
And I don't see an emergency. No, no, no.

401
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:02,850
They're residents.

402
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,250
That one... Baked a 7-layer cake

403
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,690
For that one's birthday, from scratch.

404
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,620
Oh, oh, and--and that one, that one's, uh, girlfriend...

405
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:13,790
Is taking him skiing this weekend.

406
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,210
Oh, but this one's the best.

407
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,910
Okay, this one gets to leave to go get a facial.

408
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,430
And she told her attending, and her attending was happy

409
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,940
'cause they have to have facials.

410
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,440
They're dermatologists.

411
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,700
I mean... Oh, my god.

412
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:31,610
The hospital has hired someone to rub them...

413
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,850
Full-time.

414
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,560
I bet their boyfriends don't go digging around

415
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:38,300
In their closets without asking. Never.

416
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:41,060
Ooh. I told Hahn I knew how to do

417
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:43,400
A coronary artery reanastomosis.

418
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,550
You don't.

419
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,350
I know. I looked it up, but the kid's 8.

420
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,540
He's got tiny little arteries. Okay, you know what?

421
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:52,100
Um, snag me some of those grapes there,

422
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,050
And I'll teach you.

423
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,010
Oh, and then find dr. Daisy Pepman.

424
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:59,330
Ask her for a suture kit and a 7-0 polypropylene. Dr. Daisy Pepman?

425
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,340
She's a resident. She pours fruity drinks.

426
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,020
'cause she has time for that kind of thing.

427
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,530
And I like saying her name.

428
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:08,030
So is that hyphenated, or did her parents

429
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,700
Name her Daisy-- no, no. Hey, no--no mocking

430
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,470
There is no mocking in derm...

431
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,640
Only warmth and light.

432
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,870
You all right, mrs. Paley?

433
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:23,390
You want to know what Duncan's doing?

434
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,370
Packing to leave,

435
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,680
And I can't stop him.

436
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,680
I suck at this.

437
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,320
I'm tired and I'm fried

438
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,810
Because I lie awake at night listening to him breathe

439
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,660
Because I'm afraid his heart's gonna stop

440
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,000
And he's gonna die, and I'll have been sleeping.

441
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,540
I don't know how to do this.

442
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,370
Well, no one knows

443
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,770
How to be the mom of a kid with heart failure.

444
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,120
Nobody teaches that.

445
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,820
And you have a really smart kid. You know that.

446
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:54,800
We just need to up our game a little bit. Can I try?

447
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,580
Oh, go for it.

448
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:02,780
A baseball?

449
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,160
Which is why you were so lethargic.

450
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,410
Why I slept through most of our trip, perhaps?

451
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,850
Not because I'm boring

452
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:13,330
And uninterested in the cultures of the world?

453
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,790
How was I supposed to know?

454
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,050
You were supposed to give me the benefit of the doubt,

455
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,390
Not throw electronics at me.

456
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,890
Uh, mr. Grandy, this is a massive tumor

457
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,900
In an area that's very hard to reach.

458
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:26,520
You're gonna want to talk about this with

459
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,550
Your wife. Oh, I'm sure she's fine with the risks

460
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,550
Arnie-- I'm going through with it.

461
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,280
I've got nothing left to lose.

462
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,400
We'll see you in the o.R.

463
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,240
Dr. Shepherd, that is my patient.

464
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,620
I'm sure you can use another resident,

465
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,750
Even if you can't-- Stevens, I am no

466
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,000
The traffic cop on the playground.

467
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,850
No, it's not the playground. It's the wild, wild West.

468
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,490
And you're the sheriff. Can't you be the sheriff?

469
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,620
I'll think of you when we crack his forehead open

470
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,680
I'm not letting you do this to me, Alex.

471
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,480
Do not walk away from me, Karev.

472
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:53,830
Give me back my surgery or I'll shoot your ass off!

473
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,580
He stole a very big surgery.

474
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,210
I'll pick it up.

475
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:17,790
What'd you do with the diary? It's in my locker.

476
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,450
Hey, do you want me to screen it for you?

477
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,590
Magic-marker-out all the scary parts.

478
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,690
No. No one's reading it.

479
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,530
Okay, now don't... Here.

480
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,740
Don't pull too hard. You're stretching the skin.

481
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,190
Alex stole my patient

482
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,560
With a grapefruit growing behind his eyes,

483
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:32,800
And your boyfriend couldn't give a crap.

484
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:34,130
And just in case I wasn't sure,

485
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,800
He actually said the words,

486
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:38,390
"i don't give a crap." okay, see that guy there? Okay

487
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:39,490
He's a resident.

488
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,220
He's dragging 'cause he got too much sleep last night.

489
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:44,030
Uh-huh. Too much.

490
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:45,060
What?

491
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,970
It's like watching a living freak show.

492
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:57,450
I don't talk about sex.

493
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:00,700
Please... Let's just pretend I never said even a single word.

494
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:03,040
I don't talk about sex with anyone, ever,

495
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:05,830
Not any kind of sex. Bailey, I am begging you--

496
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,850
Zz-zz.

497
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,110
The vah-jay-jay

498
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,920
Is undiscovered country.

499
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,590
It is the motherland.

500
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,640
You've never traveled there.

501
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:27,650
You don't know its customs and ways.

502
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,330
Now me, I've always wanted to go to africa.

503
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,900
Uh, but if I go,

504
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:34,980
I'm going to have to learn a few things first.

505
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:38,000
I'm going to have to prepare. I'll need shots,

506
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:41,910
Um, bring my own syringes in case something goes wrong,

507
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,450
And--and I'll want to know how to get to the embassy,

508
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,590
Just-- okay, now you've lost me.

509
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:51,700
Just talk about it.

510
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,460
Not with me. With the other one.

511
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:59,380
Just talk about the rules, uh, the expectations,

512
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:01,930
Figure out how to gracefully demure

513
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:06,360
If you find that you don't like the--the local cuisine.

514
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,790
In ethiopia,

515
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:15,560
They eat stew off of spongy, sour bread.

516
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,740
That's not for everyone.

517
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,760
Mer, I need you.

518
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:38,190
Shh. Harshing the vibe.

519
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,600
What are you doing?

520
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,680
Cristina found this magical world

521
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:45,670
Where doctors are happy and patients are pleasant

522
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,000
And no one is screaming or stealing surgeries.

523
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:51,360
Everyone just rubs each other

524
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:54,390
All day long. You all want to be dermatologists?

525
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:56,290
Dermatologists apply lotion for a living.

526
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:58,890
Yeah, that's the point. Come here.

527
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,030
Come here. S--

528
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,580
They're empty inside.

529
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,810
Completely devoid of blood lust.

530
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:07,570
They don't need to fight for anything.

531
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,170
They don't want to cut anyone open.

532
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,850
They just... Love lotion.

533
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,580
Do you know how much easier our life would be

534
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:16,210
If we could just love lotion?

535
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,860
How do you think they got that way?

536
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:20,850
Their mothers didn't leave diaries around

537
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,070
For them to read.

538
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,070
Sloan told me today to stake my claim

539
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,950
In the wild, wild West.

540
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,100
So I went all cowboy on Alex's ass,

541
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,770
And I still don't have my surgery.

542
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:34,610
These women...

543
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:37,140
They do not have to stake a claim.

544
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:40,250
Okay. You all need to snap out of it.

545
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,470
Izzie... In the wild, wild West,

546
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,260
There is always a woman in the saloon

547
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:47,360
And nobody messes with her, even though they all have guns.

548
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,800
She's a prostitute.

549
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,450
The woman in the saloon is a whore, George.

550
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:54,310
No. She just has other skills she uses

551
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,320
To make her way in the world.

552
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:58,990
So just, uh, use what you got.

553
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:03,000
Mer, I'm gonna take this, and I need you

554
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:05,760
To help me sell an idea to Hahn and the chief.

555
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:07,480
Cristina.

556
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,120
You're coming, too.

557
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:11,520
Cristina!

558
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,080
How you doing, mr. Grandy?

559
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:23,850
We, um... I've got a tumor

560
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:26,230
That's been compared to a baseball,

561
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:29,790
A grapefruit and an alie living inside my head,

562
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,980
And... My wife...

563
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:35,350
Who was ready to divorce me

564
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,430
Even before she knew that I was damaged goods,

565
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,530
She won't even look at me.

566
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,560
No, I'm sure she's just freaked out about the tumor.

567
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:45,500
It happens a lot. What if it isn't just the tumor?

568
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:48,280
I mean, what if she's figured out

569
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:50,290
That she just doesn't like me?

570
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,330
No.

571
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,970
You're a really likable guy. I can tell.

572
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,710
You're a nice girl.

573
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,250
Is your new doctor as nice as me--dr. Karev?

574
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,990
He's all right.

575
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:07,180
That's good.

576
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,830
Yeah.

577
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:12,380
He was having some personal problems,

578
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,510
Depression.

579
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,110
He's been a little... Off his game, but...

580
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:18,480
W--off his game?

581
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,380
Well, it sounds like he's bouncing back.

582
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:22,040
You'll be fine. W-wait a minute.

583
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:24,510
I don't want someone who's off his ga.

584
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,970
Can I get, uh, you back?

585
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:33,280
Well, you could talk to dr. Shepherd,

586
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:34,950
Tell him you don't want dr. Karev on your case,

587
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,160
And then I'm all yours.

588
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:45,420
What happened? She said she was feeling faint,

589
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:46,300
And I thought she was just pissed

590
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:48,970
About waiting for her cream. Her pulse ox is 90?

591
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,700
Yeah, and the oxygen's not helping.

592
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,200
Get her to the e.R.

593
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:55,950
Why didn't you move her to the e.R.? Well, i-i didn't know what to do. I--

594
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,040
So what, you've just been standing here? No,

595
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:59,140
I've been paging you. Where the hell have you been

596
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,590
Ok, here, um, aggressive fluids,

597
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,120
Supportive care, steroids. Give her 16 of dexamethasone.

598
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:09,670
Hurry. Come on!

599
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,800
B.P.'s going back up.

600
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:26,180
Okay, um, call dr. Bailey

601
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:28,390
And tell her the patient needs a plasmapheresis

602
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,020
And a skin biopsy stat.

603
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,810
You stole my surgery. It's my surgery.

604
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,720
Using me as a doormat is one thing.

605
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:42,820
Screwing with my career is another.

606
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:45,560
I have been wiping your snot

607
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:47,710
And covering your ass for weeks now,

608
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,280
And all you've done is abuse me.

609
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:50,910
And for a little while, you get to do that

610
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,100
Because you're heartbroken and pathetic,

611
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:55,000
And I'm a good friend, but it ends now.

612
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,200
Get your own surgeries and wipe your

613
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:59,040
Own snot. Dr. Shepherd, that's my surgery

614
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:00,820
The patient made the request, Karev.

615
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,200
Nothing I can do.

616
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:13,060
60% of her skin sloughed off. I'm surprised she didn't crash

617
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:15,260
When she got out of bed this morning. Dr. Sloan didn't catch it

618
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,690
When he was down here for a consult?

619
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,740
Oh, he may have been distracted by the fact

620
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,950
I told him it was necrotizing fasciitis.

621
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,400
That would do it.

622
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,020
Uh, can I do the biopsy?

623
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:25,560
Well, sure.

624
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:28,440
I didn't know you had a big interest in dermatology.

625
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,550
No, i-i don't, just the surgical part.

626
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,990
That's all right. It's good. Branch out.

627
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,850
No, dr. Bailey, I'm not interested in derm...

628
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,930
Atology.

629
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,690
We're doing a bicoronal incision.

630
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,110
Expect a lot of bleeding.

631
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:45,080
Once I get going, it'll all happen fast,

632
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:45,570
So stay with me.

633
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,210
Stevens, grab a bovie.

634
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:53,190
All right. Here we go.

635
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:14,130
You are not bringing an 8-year-old child

636
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,630
Into the o.R. He's scared, and he doesn't know what's gonna happen,

637
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,860
And there is no way for him to

638
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:20,190
Imagine it. Letting the boy see a bloody o.R

639
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,150
Isn't gonna help matters, O'malley.

640
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,590
Dr. Hahn has a thorascopic lung resection in an hour--

641
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,650
Three tiny incisions, no blood, nothing scary. And what's that gonna do?

642
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,310
It's gonna show him the room, the people, the instrument

643
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,480
Someone under anesthesia who's still alive.

644
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:32,610
Pinning him down and doping him up is...

645
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:36,000
It's gonna be traumatic for him and it's...

646
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:39,080
Showing him how it works is such an easy fix.

647
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,290
You can't see, can you?

648
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,150
Nope.

649
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,690
I don't want to go in there.

650
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:56,950
Scared?

651
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,930
Well, there's not gonna be any blood--

652
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:04,910
Nothing gross, nothing scary.

653
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,220
It's just three tiny cuts

654
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:09,480
That are so small, you can barely see 'em.

655
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,470
The first time that I went in there,

656
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:20,090
In that room, I was scared.

657
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:21,420
But that room

658
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:23,560
Is the most magical room in the world.

659
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,160
Only the finest doctors get to go in there,

660
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:27,140
And a lot of the great ones,

661
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:28,730
They're not even allowed to touch anything.

662
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,130
They can just watch.

663
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,920
I'm pretty good, so I'm still a watcher.

664
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,940
The people that work in there, they're just--

665
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:38,070
They're the best, the very best.

666
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,720
It's the safest place you'll ever be in

667
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:43,190
In your entire life.

668
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,100
Where'd that guy's face go?

669
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,860
You lost, O'malley?

670
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:04,080
Sorry.

671
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:07,050
No, wait! I want to see! I want to see the guy with no face!

672
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,290
Stop! Stop!

673
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,660
I'll give you whatever you want for the rest of your life.

674
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:13,850
Okay? Okay.

675
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:17,720
Good afternoon, Duncan.

676
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:19,560
Come on in and take a look.

677
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,460
I want to go back to the other one.

678
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,050
We're not talking about the other one.

679
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,440
This one's boring.

680
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:34,500
Yeah? Well, yours will be boring, too.

681
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,000
Do I get the big lights?

682
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:40,650
Yeah, you get all the big lights.

683
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,940
Where's the suctioner? It's right over there.

684
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:45,450
Can I feel it? I just want to feel it once.

685
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:47,530
Move over first.

686
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,160
Can I touch the scalpel?

687
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,040
You just need to lie down.

688
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,280
I just want to see everything.

689
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,750
Look here. See this? Yeah.

690
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:02,180
That's a video camera.

691
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,960
You'll be able to watch the whole thing

692
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,660
When it's over. Start shooting right now

693
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,030
What? Lie down.

694
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:11,570
See you after surgery.

695
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:15,900
Don't squeeze too hard.

696
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:18,600
The teeth on the forceps can leave holes.

697
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:20,420
That's good.

698
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,470
Very good. Keep going with that plane.

699
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,800
Great. Okay, let me take a look.

700
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,590
Cowboys don't have friends.

701
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,740
Dr. Grey, you ready?

702
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,900
Okay, good visualization, and start suturing right here.

703
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,610
All right. Keep going.

704
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,920
Very nice.

705
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:58,150
All right. Give her a little room, O'malley.

706
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,060
Okay.

707
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:00,540
Beautiful.

708
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:02,370
You can tell dr. Yang

709
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,770
She's a better teacher than I would've thought.

710
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:06,930
Sorry.

711
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:08,320
Save it.

712
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:10,430
If your colleagues know more than you do,

713
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,120
Milk 'em for all they're worth.

714
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:14,000
But you lie to me again about your experience,

715
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:16,040
And the next heart you see will be your own

716
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:18,600
As I cut it out of your chest with a steak knife.

717
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:25,860
Mrs. Grandy?

718
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,850
Your husband is in recovery.

719
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:29,030
It was a tough procedure,

720
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,980
But overall, it went really well.

721
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:36,230
He's gonna be okay, mrs. Grandy.

722
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,720
He is never gonna forgive me.

723
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:44,000
He was sick, and I told him he was lazy and boring.

724
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,160
He was sick. You didn't know.

725
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:48,540
Well, I'm his wife. I should've known.

726
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,490
He was...

727
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,210
People are terrible

728
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,470
To the people they love sometimes.

729
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,120
They're mean.

730
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,610
You were both going through a really hard time,

731
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,780
And you took it out on one another.

732
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:08,610
It isn't fun, but  is what people do.

733
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,190
That doesn't make you the worst wife in the world.

734
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,090
It just makes you... A person who made a mistake.

735
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,350
I miss anything good?

736
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:39,860
You're gonna love this.

737
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:42,110
The redhead just gave the short one a case

738
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,210
Because she thought he'd find it interesting--

739
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:47,270
A pyogenic granuloma. Gave it away.

740
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:51,790
We could transfer. Maybe we'd be happier.

741
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,030
We'd die of boredom.

742
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:56,190
We'd die with great skin. Hmm.

743
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,650
I had the biggest derm emergency

744
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,830
That exists toy,

745
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,360
And it was fun for about a minute,

746
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,080
'cause a woman almost died, but then we saved her.

747
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:07,970
And all she needed was a stupid biopsy. I tore a guy's face off.

748
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:10,380
I reattached a coronary artery.

749
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:12,190
I hate you both.

750
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,020
We are not happy, glowy people.

751
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:19,550
Yeah. Yeah.

752
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,670
We gotta get outta here.

753
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,130
Yeah. Yeah.

754
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,460
Still no word on the test?

755
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,090
George, I'm sure you passed. It'll be okay.

756
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,710
I mean, you're gonna buy me a beer tonight, and then--

757
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,170
Oh, right. It's gonna be okay.

758
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,650
O'malley. Test results.

759
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:45,900
Okay.

760
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,990
You passed.

761
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:56,600
I passed?

762
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:59,050
George, you're-- you're not an intern anymore.

763
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:02,460
I passed.

764
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:05,380
We are so gonna celebrate. I passed.

765
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:06,620
I passed.

766
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:09,000
I pass--

767
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:12,320
I'm gonna, uh, I gotta go tell Izzie and Meredith.

768
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:14,550
No, no, go tell 'em, and--and then we'll...

769
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:21,000
Okay.

770
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:25,910
Huzzah! To George O'malley, repeater no more.

771
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,410
You're gonna be impossible now.

772
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:31,170
Lexie! Come on and join us.

773
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,210
Hey, I'm gonna get a drink first.

774
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,710
Hey, Joe. Um, could I have a beer?

775
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,900
Sure. Want me to bring it to the table?

776
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:41,180
No, , I'm--i'm just gonna sit over there.

777
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:47,250
Hey, Joe, can I get another vodka tonic?

778
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,120
George passed his exam.

779
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:56,260
Tool.

780
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,460
Ah, just the people I was looking for.

781
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:03,970
Joe, I want to buy these two a drink. You are the best roommate ever.

782
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:06,200
I am. Just to be clear--

783
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,660
You two ever pull that crap on one of my cases again,

784
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:10,450
I will have you thrown out of the program.

785
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:27,090
You know what, Joe?

786
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:31,040
I-i know, okay? I know I'm being an ass.

787
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,390
I can't help it.

788
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:36,340
I'm pissed off all the time, so much, I can't even breathe.

789
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,560
But you can't be pissed at a crazy chick

790
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:39,360
For losing her mind,

791
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:41,790
So there's nobody else to be pissed at except you.

792
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:44,570
Nobody else.

793
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:09,200
We need to have rules.

794
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:10,950
What?

795
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,490
Rules. We--we need rules

796
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,800
About how we're gonna deal with the motherland.

797
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,450
Because it's undiscovered country

798
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,950
And... Maybe...

799
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,530
Maybe it'll be the best vacation

800
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,710
Either of us has ever had,

801
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,100
But... It's mysterious...

802
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:29,550
And dark...

803
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,530
And there should be rules...

804
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,230
Oh, and--and an embassy...

805
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:37,280
And a safe word.

806
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:40,880
I'm sorry.

807
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,050
What the hell are you talking about?

808
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,020
Below the...

809
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,710
Below the mason-dixon line

810
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,090
Of your pants.

811
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:55,380
I'm not sure I'm ready to go there.

812
00:38:58,690 --> 00:38:59,930
Me neither.

813
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:01,800
I--w--

814
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,700
There's lots of undiscovered territory

815
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:06,950
Above the belt.

816
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,440
Uh, we can take it slow.

817
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:13,360
Maybe... Just...

818
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:15,110
First base?

819
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:21,530
Whew. Okay. Thank you.

820
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:23,680
Sorry.

821
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,900
Here, finish my wine.

822
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,010
I'm gonna look at the menu

823
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,880
While you let your blood pressure

824
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:32,560
Drop back down to normal.

825
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:37,370
Erica.

826
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:43,960
Maybe second base, too.

827
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:04,300
I could always move back to the trailer.

828
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,980
No, I want you here.

829
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:11,480
I mean, I may not always be so graceful about it,

830
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:14,880
But... I want you here.

831
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,270
You need a place for your things.

832
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:20,770
It's not an unreasonable request.

833
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,480
You can use this as your den or your office or whatever.

834
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,440
It's your mom's den.

835
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,810
But she isn't here.

836
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:32,070
You are.

837
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:47,650
What about you?

838
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:50,980
You need someplace,

839
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:53,210
Someplace you can get away to.

840
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:57,380
Well, I can always go to Cristina's or whatever.

841
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,070
I think I have a better idea.

842
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,880
We like to think we're fearless,

843
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:06,740
Eager to explore unknown lands and soak up new experiences,

844
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:09,330
But the fact is, we're always terrified.

845
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,600
Maybe the terror is part of the attraction.

846
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:13,420
Some people go to horror movies.

847
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:16,440
We cut things open, dive into dark waters.

848
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:20,700
"october 13, 1977.

849
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,270
I haven't slept in three days."

850
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:24,660
And at the end of the day,

851
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:26,830
Isn't that what you'd rather hear about

852
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:30,590
If you've got one drink and one friend and 45 minutes?

853
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:34,110
Smooth rides make for boring stories.

854
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:37,420
A little calamity-- that's worth talking about.
