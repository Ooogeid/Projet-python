1
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:07,520
every patient's  story starts the same way...

2
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,010
it starts with them being fine.

3
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:14,530
It starts in the before.

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,190
They cling to this moment,this memory of being fine,this before...  

5
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,250
- don't worry.- As though talking about it  might somehow brg it back.

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,150
- we're gonna take care of him.- Long time.

7
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,790
Naomi. we've got an I.C.U.Bed all ready for him.

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,580
But whathey don't realize  is that the fact  at they're talking about it  to us,

9
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:33,750
their doctors...

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,720
oh,yesterday,he was fine.

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,290
- We went to lunch.I thought he was fine.- Means 

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,410
there's no going back.

13
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,530
By the time they see us...  they're already in the after.

14
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,090
What the hell are you doing?

15
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,020
The interns are broken.

16
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:59,880
They've been punished for taking out their own appendixes,and it's making them hate medicine.

17
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,270
They're lost right now and they've forgotten that this thing

18
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,410
they hate is actually a thing they love,so I'm gonna remind them.

19
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,500
Is this about denny?

20
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,530
Is this some kind of dead-boyfriend art therapy?

21
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:13,990
This is not about denny.

22
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,100
- It's about the interns.- Who cares about the interns?

23
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,030
- They're a bunch of losers.- They're not!

24
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,120
They're no they're just... oh!

25
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,440
They need to have a little fun,and so do I.

26
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,450
Where are the damn scissors?

27
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:30,730
They're right in front of you.

28
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,210
Right.

29
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,910
- Iz.- Will you hand me that large bowel,please?

30
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:46,760
Okay,See?It's gonna be great.

31
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,640
does he know how he got the parasite?

32
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,190
He thinks he got it from eating unwashed fruit in mexico.

33
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,280
He's bradycardic.

34
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:53,880
Why is he bradycardic and hypotensive?

35
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,390
he's having a reaction to the fentanyl drip.

36
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,900
Stop the fentanyl drip and push the narcan.

37
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,450
Wait.Derek,he was in status.

38
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,650
I mean,if you take him off the drip and he's seizes up,there could be permanent brain damage.

39
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:02,980
We better hope that doesn't happen.

40
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:06,320
Hope?That--that's what your plan is--is hinging on,

41
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,910
hoping that--that the worst doesn't happen?

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,010
Yeah,I'm hoping he's stopped seizing,

43
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,490
because i know if we don't reverse the drip,his heart is going to arrest.

44
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:16,350
So unless you have a better idea... push the narcan.

45
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,680
And while every patient's story  starts the same way...

46
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:25,840
how the story ends  depends on us,on how well  we diagnosis and treat.

47
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,660
We know the story  hinges on us...  

48
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,620
 he's in v-fib.Get the crash cart.

49
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,510
And we all want  to be the hero.

I heard there was a guy here with worms in his brain.

55
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,810
Does anyone know the medical term for rms in the brain?

56
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,280
dr. Stevens red esteyou today for a special project.

57
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,680
Okay,take an envelope,and then pass the rest back,but do not open them.

58
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,220
You're gonna need them for the first game we're gonna play.

59
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,680
That's what we're doing today,playing games?

60
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,600
Cheer up.We are gonna have so much fun.

61
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,210
I said don't open the envelope!

62
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,970
Don't you know how to play a simple game?

63
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,720
I d when I was 8.

64
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,750
Let's just go.

65
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,880
Thank you.

00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:17,650
dr. Bailey's with addison today,so I'm gonna hand out your morning assignments.

67
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,360
Addison's in the hospital?

68
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,250
Her brother was admitted last night with parasites in his brain.

69
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:25,380
Addison's brother has neurocysticercosis?

70
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,480
see?

71
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,750
That's what I'm talking about.

72
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,090
I cleared my schedule.

73
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:37,960
Oh,you didn't he to do that.I'm--I'm fine.

74
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,900
Your brother has parasites in his brain.

75
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,560
I cleared my schedule.You cut your hair.

76
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,070
Oh,yeah.

77
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:43,910
I like it.

78
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,420

00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,450
It's nice to meet you,miranda.

82
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,930
- So how is he?- Oh,I don't know.

83
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:00,890
He's groggy,his eyes are open,but I don't think he's awake because he hasn't tried to kill me.

84
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,740
Her brother hates me.

85
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,330
people pick sides in a divorce,derek.

86
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,500
He picked sides in thearriage.

87
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:10,150
He first seized during sex with his girlfriend.

88
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,610
I wonder why she's not here.

89
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,410
Oh,she is.

90
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,190
Naomi?

91
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,950
I'm going in there.

92
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,630
You and archer?

93
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:25,760
No.

94
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,820
Uh,well,yeah.I mean,I don't-- I don't know.

95
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:31,550
- Yeah,I don't know.I don't know wha- we are.

96
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,600
How's sam?

97
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,550
Sam's good.

98
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,930
And,uh,how's,um... meredith--is that her name?

99
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,140
She's good.

100
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,360
- Good.- Yeah.

101
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:48,500
Well,look at us.We're standing here making polite conversation about your girlfriend.

102
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:54,240
You two are divorced,me and sam are divorced,and I'm with archer,sort of.

103
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,240
What the hell happened?

104
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,060
I mean,you--you wrote addison a song,derek.

105
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,520
Can we just forget about the song?Enough about the song.

106
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:05,700
What?You wrote her her own love song and you sang it to her at the wedding.

107
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,710
Mark wrote it or sam-- somebody.I don't remember who it was.

108
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,280
I do.I do.

109
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:12,710
I was drunk at the time,but I remember,and I remember thinking you guys were gonna last forever,

110
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,480
that we were all gonna last forever.

111
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,050
Yeah.

112
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,700
You should call sam.

113
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,540
- He misses you.- Yeah.

114
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,250
how'd you sleep?

115
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,480
not too well.

116
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,540
Shoulder pain?

117
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,890
- No.Pain-in-the-ass wi.- No.

118
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:35,940
I kept him up all night because I was afraid my aneurysm was gonna explode and I was gonna die.

119
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,520
Hi,I'm dr. Karev.

120
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,110
Well,where's dr. Grey?She's supposed to be in my surgery.

121
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,750
Uh,she and dr. Shepherd got called in on an emergency.

122
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,990
So it looks like he's not gonna get to your aneurysm until later.

123
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,630
Wh--later when?

124
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,930
Could be a few hours,it could even be tomorrow.

125
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,430
tomorrow?I mean,she's already waited till tom--today is tomorrow.

126
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,050
I'm sorry.Who are you?

127
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,630
I'm her husband.Oh,I look like this because--

128
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:05,780
I ran him over with our car before I knew I had this huge time bomb in my head,

129
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,970
when I was just a big ol' pregnant person waiting for her baby.

130
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:17,100
So... just,please,if dr. Shepherd could,you know,get to me sooner rather than later.

131
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,430
what's the emergency?

132
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,070
Addison's brother.

133
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:24,020
Addison's here?

134
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:27,030
We were having dinner,and he just passed out.

135
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,900
I am telling you,it is probably just my hernia.

136
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:33,640
Uh,he has an inguinal hernia,but it doesn't seem to be the source of the obstruction.

137
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,110
You know,honey,it's gonna take these doctors a long time to figure this out,all right?

138
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,850
I am fine here.

139
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,500
Now you gotta go to work.

140
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,440
He hates it when we try to help him.

141
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,650
He's a l like my second graders that way.

142
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:47,830
okay,daddy,you win.And I have my cell.

143
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,820
So call me if you need me.

144
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,220
Okay. Bye.

145
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,680
I have colorectal cancer.

146
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:03,750
I've had five polyps removed in the last three years,and radiation.

147
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:06,620
My daughter doesn't know,and I would like to keep it that way.

148
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:11,170
dr. Yang is gonna set you up for a C.T.With contrast.

149
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,410
Where have you been treated?We'll need to get your medical records.

150
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:16,640
Columbia hospital in verona,and dr. Shulty.

151
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:24,550
I,uh... I work here now.

152
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,830
I saw that you were in and I thought I--

153
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,860
you waited till she left to come in and say hello.

154
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,240
That's just like you to face up to things like a man.

155
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,470
You should really tell her about the cancer,michael.

156
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,660
- She deserves to know.- You lost the right to tell me anything about her

157
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:44,650
when you broke off your engagement in a 2-line e-mail.

158
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:58,880
* our eyes met over the cadaver   and I knew I had to have her *

159
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,180
 what was the next line?

160
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:02,340
can we talk about something else?

161
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:06,770
* had his mitral valve   grown too thick? *

162
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:10,920
* Is that what made our cadaver so sick? *

163
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,620
Greatest love song of all time.

164
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:17,220
Did you guys get to the part where derek rhymes "gross anatomy class" with "addison's fine ass"?

165
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,280
'Cause I wrote that line.

166
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,460
Oh,my bad.

167
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,300
No,no,it's fine.

168
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:26,700
I,uh... I think it sounds like a fine song.

169
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:31,390
Archie,I heard you were gonna let derek remove those little suckers from your brain.

170
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,890
- Maybe.- he is.

171
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:36,970
I hate surgery,especially brain surgery.

172
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,040
Yeah.

173
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,370
Being a neurologist,you probably see a lot of patients post-op who are just,you know,

174
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:44,830
- scrambled eggs up there-- okay,you know what,ark?You're not helping right now.

175
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:48,790
We're sitting here trying to convince him that surgery is-- 

176
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,880
is not an option.

177
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,780
According to these scans,the single cyst that you had in your last C.T.

178
00:08:55,930 --> 00:09:00,110
Has now multiplied by eight,all clogging the third ventricle.

179
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:05,620
There's no way I can surgically navigate through a mess like that without rupturing one.

180
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:08,080
so what does that mean?

181
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:18,730
You're in a room full of doctors,addison,who are all being very quiet right now.

182
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,430
I'm gonna die.

183
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:27,010
That's what it means.

184
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:37,080
********Is the name of a surgery.

185
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,220
Your task is to drape your patients accordingly.

186
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:43,090
On your marks.Get set.Go.

187
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,040
come on,people.Lighten up.This is supposed to be fun.

188
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,280
Don't take it so serusly.

189
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,630
You suck at this!My grandmother could drape better than you.

190
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,460
I'm sorry.I'll--I'll try to do better next time.

191
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:02,860
No,no.I'm just-- you're doing great.

192
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,750
I'm--I'm trash-talking.

193
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,360
I'm having fun.It's just-- I'm--it's fun.

194
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,270
what do you... 

195
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,790
Lookin' good.

196
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:19,520
- Good job.- Done.

197
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:23,310
- Good... - laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

198
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:24,650
- Yeah,that's good.Here..- Yes.

199
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,760
- Your,uh,next challenge- Me,too.I'm done,too.

200
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,190
A whipple is for pancreatic cancer.

201
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,990
Were you planning on going in through the mouth?

202
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,950
Start over.

203
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:52,320
there's just no way,addie.

204
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:56,210
I talked to conroy at cedars,larry at mayo,and they agree.There'd just be-- 

205
00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:01,200
I put... you in A... tiny box.

206
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,550
After the divorce,I made you... petty and inconsequential

207
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,490
and nothing special so that you could fit into this tiny...

208
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,880
little box that would help me get out of bed in the morning.

209
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:22,300
But now... now I have to take you out of the box because...

210
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:26,320
I need to believe that,uh,you can do this,that you can save my brother.

211
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,720
I need you to be a god.

212
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:33,410
just today... be a god.

213
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,830
Uh,montgomery,archer.

214
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:45,030
I'm a friend.

215
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,640
I'm dr. Miranda bailey.I'm a friend of addison'S.

216
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,040
- Which one are you?- I'm sorry?

217
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:55,420
Archer is addison's brother,and archer's girlfriend is addison's best friend,

218
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:58,380
o used to be married to derek's best friend,who derek hasn't spoken to ...

219
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,430
- since the divorce.- Right,right.

220
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:02,360
Well,that would be me,the ex-husband.

221
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,110
uh,dr. Samuel bennett.

222
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,950
Sorry.

223
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:12,550
Well,I didn't think the ex-husband would show up at the ex-wife's boyfriend's bedside.

224
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,590
Right.Don't worry about it.Uh,even I don't know why I'm here.

225
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,690
- but,uh,yeah.- Third floor.Room 3420.

226
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,880
Thank you.

227
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:27,660
dr. Bennett.

228
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:32,910
- Uh,sam.- dr. Sheprd is still studying the scans,

229
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:37,140
looking for a way to operate,but it looks like a difficult case.

230
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,870
Right.

231
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,900
You know,addison's brother probably isn't gonna make it.

232
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:47,150
his cysts are inoperable.

233
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,950
Worms in the brain-- not how you want to go.

234
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,020
I didn't even know addison had a brother.

235
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:54,980
I mean,you'd think derek would've said something at some point

236
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,190
or sang something while he played his guitar.

237
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,550
- Speak english.- Oh,derek used to play the guitar.

238
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:03,960
Owen's ex-fianc is in the hospital.

239
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,390
His ex-fianc he never told me about.

240
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,370
What's wrong with her?

241
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,620
Well,she calls her dad "daddy."

242
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:14,060
no.What's wrong with her?Why is she in the hospital?

243
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,370
Oh,she isn'T.

244
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,440
Daddy is.

245
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:20,920
Hey,you know,you should ask owen if he plays the guitar.

246
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,990
"Find dr. Sloan."He's your patient.Ask him his sympto.

247
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:27,770
Diagnose him correctly to receive your next challenge." What are your symptoms?

248
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,830
Well,right now I'm battling a rapid heart rate.

249
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,720
I'm also feeling a little flushed.

250
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,120
I don't even want to mention what's going on below the belt.

251
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,400
Hey,no.I-I-I don't do dirty,secret flirting with you anymore.

252
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,400
Okay?I-I told you,if you want to go public with me,

253
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:43,770
with us,then I will do dirty,public flirting.

254
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:47,840
I mean,I will--I will flirt publicly,not dirtily.

255
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,900
Maybe a little dirtily.

256
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,060
Will you--would you please tell me your symptoms so I can concentrate?

257
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:58,000
"Tachycardia,angiodema,"hypotension,severe chest and abdominal pain,

258
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,900
difficulty breathing and throat clo--" anaphylactic shock!

259
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,390
- Foul.- What?

260
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,770
You heard her answer.

261
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:05,840
Well,the whole hospital heard her answer.

262
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:09,250
Well,you shoulda kept a respectful distance.New symptoms.Resume play.

263
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:16,580
All right.You must have questions,so ask.

264
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,970
When was his last polypectomy?Since you're familiar with the patient.

265
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:22,180
- That's not what I meant.- No,I know what you meant.

266
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,610
- dr. Yang,what are your symptoms?- Now is not a good time.

267
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,520
"Heavy feeling in the abdomen accompanied by nausea and acute pulling sensation in the scrotum.

268
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,000
" Uh,testicular cancer.

269
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:37,460
- cristina-- I have to get mr.Whitman to C.T.

270
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,660
 I wasn't doing anyone any good at school,so... 

271
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,050
owen?

272
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,490
I don't understand.

273
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:54,320
- What...- I work here.

274
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:56,670
Wh-what do you mean?

275
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,420
What do you mean?

276
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:04,610
- Beth...- when did you get back?

277
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:09,810
I-I-I just sawour mom.She didn't s--

278
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,850
 I thought you were in iraq.

279
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,710
I--I've been praying for you every night.

280
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:27,110
Every night I'm on my knees praying that y-you're gonna make it back,

281
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:29,000
that you'll make it another 24 hours,

282
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:33,190
that you'll...  you'll make it home.

283
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:37,930
Oh,owen.

284
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:40,480
You're back.

285
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,720
 What is she doing?

286
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,610
It looks like she's praying.

287
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:15,720
Mm,no.Addie doesn't pray

288
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,150
What is she doing?

289
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,790
uh,she's praying.

290
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,480
no,addison doesn't pray.She must be hiding.

291
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,220
I can hear you.

292
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:26,280
And I'm not hiding.I am trying to pray,but I don't know how to pray

293
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:29,540
because I'm a wasp,and we only go to church on christmas.

294
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,660
You guys go.I got this.

295
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,200
I have no clout with god.

296
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:56,620
god doesn't even know who I am,which sucks,because I could... 

297
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:02,270
I could use some help.

298
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:14,680
dear god,I need your guidance.

299
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,400
I kissed a peds surgeon.

300
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,440
You kissed a peds surgeon?

301
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,220
I never thought I'd end up with a woman,god,

302
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,820
but--I mean,not until lately-- but that--that's not the problem.

303
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,740
The prlem is the peds thing.She's--she's perky... 

304
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:30,000
and has butterflies on her scrub cap.

305
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:36,320
But she'S... also hot... really hot.

306
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:41,240
So... help me get over the butterflies.

307
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,500
Amen.

308
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:56,610
You're an amazing doctor.You save babies.God knows who you are.

309
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,860
Do you really believe in all this... in god?

310
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,730
Sometimes.

311
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:14,690
Well... most of the time,when it counts.

312
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:23,810
your wife's in the chapel praying.

313
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,680
She's not my wife,and she doesn't pray.

314
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:29,330
How are you?

315
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,080
Good.Oh,you know,midlife crisis.

316
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,570
I got an earring.I got an earring.

317
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:37,530
But I-I let the hole closep the very next day.

318
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,580
Oh,that woulda--woulda been a good look on you.

319
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,360
I met,uh,meredith.

320
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,790
she's not a midlife crisis.

321
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,220
She's the real thing.

322
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:50,490
That's great.I'm happy for you,man.

323
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,980
- I'm happy for you.- yeah.

324
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:56,090
- I shoulda called.- no.

325
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,790
No,I should've stayed in touch.It's my fault.

326
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,930
Hey,people move,they change.

327
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,660
- You know,we all did.- Yeah.

328
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:05,130
So... but yeah.

329
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,570
She's praying.

330
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,430
Yeah.

331
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:14,110
She's expecting a miracle... and I can't deliver one.

332
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:19,150
I've seen patients with one cyst in the ventricle,maybe two.

333
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,080
He has eight.

334
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,990
There is no way I can get a scope in there without rupturing one.

335
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,280
There's too many.

336
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,810
Maybe you're just too close to it.

337
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,050
What if there were just one?

338
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:37,400
You know,explain to me how you would remove just that one.

339
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,250
110 over 80.

340
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:44,090
What's the prize for winning?

341
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,670
They need a prize.

342
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,980
They're getting a prize,a really big prize.

343
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:50,480
I need a prize.

344
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,570
What's going on?

345
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:56,060
Uh,my patients needed a distraction,and,uh,izzie needed real patients.

346
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:57,610
- So how's it going?- It's going great.

347
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,260
Super fun.We're having a lot of fun.

348
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,630
dr. Grey.

349
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,250
Oh,my god.Am I going to surgery now?

350
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,860
Could be any time now,jen.

351
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,130
what?

352
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,660
I can't find it.

353
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,330
Wait... is something wrong?

354
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:15,070
Is the baby's heart not beating?

355
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:17,800
- What-- you're on the kid's ass.

356
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,530
The heart's over here.

357
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,850
thank god.

358
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,770
it's not what you think.

359
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:38,440
I can guarantee I'm not as much of an ass as you think I am.

360
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,690
does your mother know you're back?

361
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,840
page me when this is done.

362
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:53,450
All right,archer.

363
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:56,360
I need to create room in the ventricle so I can maneuver the scope.

364
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:58,670
If I deflate each cyst,the scope can remove them one by one.

365
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,280
The cysts will rupture.

366
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:03,790
I'm gonna grab each one with forceps,pull it up to the edge of the port and suction out the fluid.

367
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,820
- The suction would have to be precise-- it will be.

368
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,630
- You can't do it.- Well,I think I can.

369
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:11,770
Basically you can control the way thcyst ruptures?

370
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,150
No,he can'T.

371
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:16,540
- Look,I know you guys want me to go down fighting,but I-- coward.

372
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,460
Excuse me?

373
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,960
I said "coward." You're a coward by trade.You're a neurologist.

374
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:24,530
You guys feed off us,refer your patients to us,let us assume the responsibility,

375
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,850
and if god forbid something happens,well... I'll tell you what,I can assume the responsibility.

376
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,560
The question is,can you?

377
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:57,240
Peds surgery fellowship?

378
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:00,610
Yep,just when I'm almost done with my general surgery residency.

379
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:02,210
Crazy,huh?

380
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:05,290
No,just,uh... surprising.

381
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:08,290
Uh,you don't seem lik a-a peds person to me.

382
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:10,030
Why not?

383
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:12,270
Because you don't smile.

384
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,880
- Peds people smile.- I smile.

385
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:20,160
Well,I'm not going to smile right now,but I do smile.

386
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,240
I smile frequently.

387
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,400
He under yet?

388
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,540
Yeah.

389
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,850
A peds surgery fellowship?

390
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,500
I have a child.I'm familiar with children.

391
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:38,840
I am going to be an excellent pediatric surgeon.

392
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,360
You're gonna want to keep that temper in check around the kids.

393
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,260
Weird seeing archie on that table.

394
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,270
yeah.

395
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:53,240
asma.

396
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:55,330
Looks like I'm low.

397
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:01,390
krez,refill this for dr. Bennett here.

398
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,400
thanks.

399
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,880
It's good practice.

400
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,430
Asthma's big with the kids.

401
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:19,850
say it,derek.Come on,say it.Say it.Say it.Say it.Say it.Say it.

402
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:29,070
okay,everybody.It's a beautiful day to save lives.

403
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:31,870
Scalpel.

404
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,160
at some point,you're gonna have to tell her.

405
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:36,970
This is beth we're talking about.

406
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:40,640
She worries herself sick when one of her students gets the sniffles.

407
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:43,140
She can't handle bad news.

408
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,530
She's a sunshine girl.

409
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:48,340
And you used to know that about her.

410
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,550
Well,she'll find out eventually.

411
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,300
dr. Yang.

412
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:58,630
What's going on?

413
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,820
- Ruthcall the chief and reserve an O.R.- Owen--

414
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:04,130
it's A... I-it's a cplication.

415
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:06,220
He needs surgery.

416
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:09,940
But what... a c--a complication from what?

417
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:13,360
he's gonna be okay.

418
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:15,500
I'll keep you update let's go.

419
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:22,300
okay,entering the third ventricle.

420
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,030
all right.Securing cyst number one.

421
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:38,190
Deflating cyst one.

422
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,050
All right.Suction.

423
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,930
Any sign of the scolex?

424
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,580
there it is.

425
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:06,010
one at a time.One at a time.

426
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:09,270
Okay.

427
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,260
I need to be distracted.

428
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:14,030
Someone,um,talk about something other than what's going on with my brother right now.

429
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:17,300
Uh,mark is good at talking about himself.

430
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:22,290
Actually,I've been using endoscopy for head and neck cancer resections,

431
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:27,380
and if I could just focus the criteria for patients,I might have a breakthrough on my hands.

432
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:29,670
What happened to you?

433
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,120
He met someone.

434
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,540
dr. Grey.

435
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,240
dr. Torres said I,uh,had to eat.I'm sorry.

436
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:46,050
No,it's okay. How is it?

437
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:48,090
It's amazing.

438
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:53,750
I'm sorry.I'm sorry.

439
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:55,340
It's bland.It's really bland.

440
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,600
I need my surgery,now!

441
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:01,170
What kind of hospital is this?How long am I supposed to wait?

442
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,560
- Because-- look,stop it!

443
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:09,170
Look,uh... if you don't settle down,your blood pressure's gonna rise,

444
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,210
and you're gonna start contracting.

445
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:14,520
I'm sorry because I don't know you,but you really need to shut up,okay?

446
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,900
all right.There.

447
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,370
Look.

448
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:25,120
There's your son's face.

449
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:29,180
That's what you need to hold on to for the next couple of hours,okay?

450
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:39,410
let's see here.

451
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:42,580
is--is that a tumor?

452
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:46,470
he's gonna need moreggressive treatment.

453
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,440
- He'll have to tell his daughter now.- he won'T.

454
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,070
Her mother died when she was little.

455
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:56,060
He feels that's enough sadness for anyone,so... he sheltered her.

456
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,410
She always had a nice car,nice clothes,anything she wanted.

457
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:00,250
Well,she'll find out eventually.

458
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,870
She used to call me in tears when there was a spider in her apartment.

459
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,700
It became a joke between michael and I.

460
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:10,090
Neither of us could be out of town at the same time in case beth found a bug.

461
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:14,420
well,when he needs to go through chemo or gets so sick he needs hospice care,

462
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:17,220
she'll find out when it's already over.

463
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:19,620
She deserves more than that.

464
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:24,030
okay,dr. Grey,what's the number?

465
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,170
Seven cysts,seven scolexes.

466
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,310
Okay,then one more.

467
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,580
damn it.

468
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,350
he's getting bradycardic.

469
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:44,100
I need to irrigate,see if the flow is blocked.

470
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:48,920
asystole.

471
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,320
Start the code clock.

472
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,030
derek,asystole.

473
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:57,430
Where the hell is it?

474
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:00,050
get the crash cart.Starting compressions.

475
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,380
No!Stop!Nobody move.

476
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:04,080
We can't start compressions.I need to find the worm.

477
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:05,590
- But he's--we have two minutes,maybe three.

478
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,500
Nobody move.Just stop.

479
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:10,710
how long has he been down?

480
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:12,960
2 minutes,20 seconds.

481
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:26,530
**

482
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:28,370
it's starting to tear apart.

483
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:31,020
Maybe if I just rotate it and reverse it back.

484
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,980
and that's number eight.

485
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,030
heart rate's coming back up.

486
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,090
okay.

487
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,450
Thank you,everybody.

488
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:54,850
you just made some friends  of mine very happy.

489
00:28:58,010 --> 00:28:59,390
I just got out of surgery.What's going on?

490
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:01,550
- Could be any minute now.- She needs a prize.

491
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:04,970
A big prize,but not too big,because they did take out their own appendixes.

492
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:07,260
And I understand they're still being punished for that

493
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,290
and that you think they're not even qualified to hold a clamp,

494
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:13,290
so... do you have any prizes like that?

495
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,950
Thank you.They just got their symptoms from their final patients.

496
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,710
Get outhe finish line.It's gonna be close.

497
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:30,150
here they come!

498
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,320
all right,alright,all right!Come on,run!

499
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,830
Come on!Come on!Come on,come on!Bring it in!

500
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,070
- Move!Move!- george?

501
00:29:58,170 --> 00:29:59,650
3-way tie.

502
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,920
- okay,final patient diagnosis.- Motion sickness!

503
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,150
- No.- Dengue fever!

504
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,860
- No!- Neurocysticercosis!

505
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:07,100
- yay!- ladies and gentlemen,we have a winner.

506
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,560
Nicely done.

507
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:13,070
yes!

508
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,490
Wait,what's the prize?

509
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,430
- you get to scrub in on shepherd's craniotomy...- yes!

510
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,680
And hold the doomsday sucker.

511
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,370
What's the doomsday sucker?

512
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:22,500
Doomsday sucker?

513
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,690
- It's just a really big sucker.- Yeah!

514
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,990
It was a hard surgery.

515
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,990
Some of the bowel was dead,as we suspected,

516
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:38,600
but we were able to remove the diseased part successfully.

517
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:42,930
He's in recovery,and you can see him in about an hour.

518
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,700
You don't even look like yourself.

519
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,280
Excuse me?

520
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,470
You don'T.

521
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:53,890
You look... hard.

522
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:59,130
And... look,I-I know it-- it wasn't easy over there.

523
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:03,460
I-I hear people come back and...

524
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:08,510
I know you can't just come back and be normal right away,

525
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:10,480
- but-- he'll be asleep for a couple of hours,

526
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:13,210
but you can see him now.

527
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:16,270
Two lines in an e-il?

528
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:19,580
I deserve more than that.

529
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,680
Beth,your dad has colorectal cancer.

530
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:30,680
He's already been through radiation treatment and polyp removals.

531
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:36,180
He didn't tell you... 'cause he didn't want to burden you.

532
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:40,570
He'd like to spare you any pain... 

533
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,930
any more pain.

534
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,320
He had all these friends.

535
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:02,680
They sang and they played guitar and...

536
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:06,040
it's almost like he was a totally different person.

537
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:08,270
Well,he was.

538
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:11,360
It kinda freaks me out a little bit.

539
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:14,820
I feel like I don't know him.

540
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,540
And I don't know owen.

541
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:22,240
We don'T.We don't know them.

542
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:30,280
Sadie. Sadie,hey.

543
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:31,920
Hold up.Hold up.Hold up.

544
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,820
I just wanted to let you know,um,I'm happy to help you if you'd like--

545
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:38,710
you know,reviewing the basics or putting in some supervised skills lab hours.

546
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:39,830
Excuse me?

547
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:45,740
Well,I... I was a repeater earlier this year.I know how easy it is to get behind.

548
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,620
I don't need a tutor.

549
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,060
- You don't?- No.

550
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,930
At this point in your training,you should be able to hear symptoms,

551
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:57,840
diagnose the problem and decide whether or not a patient needs surgery.

552
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:00,330
Can you do that?

553
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,000
Can you?

554
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:11,890
Because th think you can,and they will put you in situations where you have to.

555
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:20,350
Sadie,you could hurt someone.

556
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:36,660
I call her.

557
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:40,030
All right?I call my mother once a week.

558
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,430
I haven't told her that I'm back.She thinks that I'm calling from...

559
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,920
I keep the conversations short

560
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:54,160
because I can't bear for her to know that the son she sent off to war is gone.

561
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:57,320
He's gone.

562
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:00,130
And if I just got in my car and drove the six miles to see her,

563
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:06,600
she'd be so sad,and she would look at me the same way that beth does now...

564
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:09,500
like I'm not there.

565
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:17,430
The only time I don't feel like a ost is when you look at me because you look at me 

566
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,190
and you see me.You see me.

567
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:23,930
This is me.This is me.

568
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:28,190
Please,cristina,see me.

569
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,860
See me.

570
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,700
Jen,I am so sorry.

571
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,690
I have you scheduled for first thing tomorrow morning.

572
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:58,730
Derek... uh,I'm using your first name now...

573
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,420
because I like you a lot and I'm starting to consider us friends,

574
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,980
- so I'm using your first name and I'm calling you derek.- Okay.

575
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:12,770
And,derek,I'm begging you,please,please,please don't make me wait another night.

576
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:19,670
She's good.Try being married to her.You'll never say no again.

577
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:25,350
dr. Grey.

578
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:28,460
It would appear that congratulations are in order.

579
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,680
Thank you,dr. Sloan.

580
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:34,270
I'd also like it acknowledged that I offer these congratulations professionally

581
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:40,180
and respectfully... without any innuendo or inappropriate body language.

582
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,580
Acknowledged,dr. Sloan.

583
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:47,210
Doou know,what's a doomsday sucker?

584
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,150
Addison montgomery.

585
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:51,000
uh,l-lexie grey.

586
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,400
- Mark,addie,little grey.- Little grey?

587
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:56,300
I am gonna have to meet you at joe's in a bit.

588
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:57,890
I have a craniotomy.

589
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,880
Little grey,I hear you're gonna be holding the doomsday sucker.

590
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:03,260
Now?Great.Yeah,yeah,yes.Yes,sir.

591
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,090
- O.R.Two.I'll see you there.- okay.

592
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,650
doomsday sucker!

593
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,540
Can you believe little grey and,uh--

594
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,950
hey,did you hear derek was gonna propose to meredith?

595
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:16,630
- How about that?- And I'm off to surgery.

596
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,220
What?

597
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,040
Iz... what's going on with you?

598
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,320
Nothing.

599
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,890
I'm fine.

600
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:39,750
You saw.The interns are not a bunch of losers.

601
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,220
They know things.They're gonna make good doctors.

602
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,270
Really,I'm fine.

603
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,470
I'm fine.

604
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,270
she knows nothing.

605
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,950
Just... nothing.

606
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:54,950
She's a danger to the patients,and so I told her that she could tell the chief or I could,

607
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,370
and I wanted to let you know because you're her friend.

608
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:03,620
Although for the life of me,I... I don't know how you two were ever friends.

609
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,180
What happened?

610
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,650
I quit.

611
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:13,530
O'malley's a little narc.

612
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,540
I'd rather be deemed a quitter than a cheater.

613
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:21,130
Did you cheat your way into the program?

614
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,500
Listen,I'm not book smart.

615
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,320
You know that.

616
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,260
I learn on my feet.

617
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:33,650
- I thought if I came to where you were,you could...- pull you through.

618
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:36,450
We've seen each otherthrough a lot.

619
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:41,490
We're not 25,sleeping our way through europe anymore.

620
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,280
We could though.

621
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,680
Think about it.We could get on a plane tonight.

622
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:47,080
- We could go-- no,no.

623
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,020
I can'T.

624
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,500
I have to work.

625
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,970
I can't just...

626
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:56,250
wow,you know...

627
00:37:56,450 --> 00:38:00,350
they've sucked the life right out the meredith I used to know--

628
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,200
is right here.

629
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:04,730
I'm here.

630
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,570
I just don't want to sleep my way through europe anymore.

631
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:11,360
I want to be here. I want to be here.

632
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:19,970
sucker at the ready?

633
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:22,010
Sucker's at the ready.

634
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,790
You're mocking me.

635
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:27,080
Only a little.

636
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,970
Damn it.damn it.

637
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:29,990
What,what happened?

638
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:33,100
- B.P.Ov 88 er 60. - Hang 2 units of blood.

639
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:36,060
Okay,all joking aside,dr. Grey,bring in the doomsday sucker.

640
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:38,030
Okay.Put it right in there.Right in here. Get in there.

641
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:41,300
 Oh,my god.

642
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,750
Okay. Microsutures,please.

643
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,530
B.P. I110 over 72.

644
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,670
okay,get the sucker out of there.

645
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:56,860
Is that it?Did you--did you get it?

646
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:00,700
There's good flow.

647
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:03,830
yes,we did it.

648
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,440
And that will teach me never to mock an eager young intern again.

649
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,620
I'm an ass.

650
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,520
You are such an ass.

651
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:20,090
I shouldn't have blurted.

652
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:22,290
Y--a little warning would have been nice.

653
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,970
but you're okay?

654
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:28,430
You know,it's strange.I... I expected this horrible feeling,

655
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,540
this wave of sadness or something to just take over,

656
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:38,240
but... people get divorced... they meet new people,they remarry.

657
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,940
I don't know.You know,maybe it just.

658
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,350
Seeing archer in that O.R.,It just... 

659
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,500
changed my perspective or something.

660
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,990
But you sort of wished it'd been you first.

661
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:52,880
Oh,shut it.

662
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:55,990
So what,are you gonna ll derek about the-- okay,wait,wait.

663
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:59,670
If we call meredith the 12 year old,what--what do we call lexie,a preschooler?

664
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,300
She's a woman.

665
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:03,640
- oh,okay.- And I'm gonna tell him.

666
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:07,060
I'm working on it.

667
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:10,240
- There he is!-oh,there you go.

668
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:12,760
That's the kind of welcome I deserve.

669
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:15,140
joe,scotch for the neuro god.

670
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,130
You... you were a god today.

671
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,240
You were a god in that O.R.

672
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:20,690
You slew dragons,you walked on water.

673
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:24,640
You... you were a god,but now...

674
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:28,310
 now you need to get very tiny again...

675
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:32,080
and go back in the box.

676
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,370
How--how was your craniotomy?

677
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:35,290
- It was fine.- Yeah?

678
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:37,020
Yeah,and I stopped in on archer on my way out.

679
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,600
Things are,uh,good.

680
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:40,440
Good.

681
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:46,180
had his mitral valve gotten too thick?

682
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:47,440
oh,god.Shut up.

683
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:52,060
Is that what made the cadaver so sick?

684
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,490
but we can't-- wait,we can't remember the chorus.Come on.

685
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:57,460
Yeah,we got all the way through the second verse... no.

686
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:58,310
