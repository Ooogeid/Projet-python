1
00:00:01,121 --> 00:00:04,629
<i>In order to get a good diagnosis,</i>

2
00:00:10,024 --> 00:00:12,850
<i>doctors have to constantly change
their perspective.</i>

3
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:19,746
<i>We start by getting
the patient's point of view...</i>

4
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,970
<i>Though they often don't have
a clue what's going on.</i>

5
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,380
<i>So we look at the patient
from every possible angle.</i>

6
00:00:33,298 --> 00:00:34,869
<i>We rule things out.</i>

7
00:00:35,486 --> 00:00:37,369
<i>We uncover new information...</i>

8
00:00:38,695 --> 00:00:41,364
<i>Trying to get
to what's actually wrong.</i>

9
00:00:45,817 --> 00:00:47,684
<i>We're asked
for second opinions...</i>

10
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:51,219
<i>Hoping we'll see something
others might have missed.</i>

11
00:00:56,519 --> 00:00:59,757
<i>For the patient,
a fresh perspective</i>

12
00:00:59,849 --> 00:01:02,350
<i>Can mean the difference
between living and dying.</i>

13
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:05,295
<i>For the doctor...</i>

14
00:01:05,614 --> 00:01:07,227
<i>It can mean
you're picking a fight</i>

15
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:09,444
<i>With everyone who got there
before you.</i>

16
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:11,537
- Someone's getting fired.
- Stop it.

17
00:01:11,629 --> 00:01:13,184
She wasn't even my patient.

18
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:14,879
- What?
- Nothing.

19
00:01:15,913 --> 00:01:17,607
How long is this
gonna take?

20
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:19,430
Why, you need to me
a phone call?

21
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,417
I said enough!

22
00:01:35,953 --> 00:01:37,434
What happened here tonight,

23
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,272
What happened to that patient,
was inexcusable.

24
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:42,588
And we're gonna be here

25
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,495
Till I find out
who's responsible for it.

26
00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:46,469
So until then,
you will sit down,

27
00:01:46,561 --> 00:01:48,395
You will shut up
and you'll wait to be called.

28
00:01:54,113 --> 00:01:54,799
Hunt.

29
00:01:58,647 --> 00:01:59,934
I'm not going down
for this.

30
00:02:00,613 --> 00:02:01,817
Someone is.

31
00:02:15,555 --> 00:02:18,078
Dr. Hunt, you know
larry jennings from our board.

32
00:02:18,206 --> 00:02:19,688
And this is
our in-house counsel.

33
00:02:19,771 --> 00:02:22,774
We're just trying to get
in front of this thing,  I need you to give me

34
00:02:22,857 --> 00:02:26,076
The lay of the land of your e.R.
Tonight, from the beginning.

35
00:02:26,204 --> 00:02:28,736
We were slammed with
a mass casualty, a hotel fire--

36
00:02:28,842 --> 00:02:31,772
<i>Half a dozen burn victims,
a penetrating chest wound,</i>

37
00:02:31,899 --> 00:02:33,743
<i>A firefighter
with multiple traumas.</i>

38
00:02:33,846 --> 00:02:34,974
What doctors were working?

39
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,098
Yang, grey, karev, adamson,

40
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:40,432
<i>That big kid whose name
I don't know, kepner,</i>

41
00:02:40,528 --> 00:02:41,838
<i>Avery and torres.</i>

42
00:02:41,933 --> 00:02:44,228
And who was on the patient
in question, the one that died?

43
00:02:47,356 --> 00:02:48,861
Everyone.
Everyone was everywhe.

44
00:02:48,972 --> 00:02:51,489
All right.
Who got the chart first?

45
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,865
Dr. Yang.

46
00:02:56,025 --> 00:02:57,527
It wasn't my patient.

47
00:02:58,343 --> 00:03:01,035
I had it for two seconds,
and then I was called outside.

48
00:03:01,118 --> 00:03:02,584
Okay,
start from the beginning.

49
00:03:03,727 --> 00:03:05,107
I was paged to the e.R.

50
00:03:09,162 --> 00:03:10,806
I'm putting myself
on a time-out

51
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:12,650
Before I kill someone.
Have you seen bailey?

52
00:03:12,733 --> 00:03:15,223
She was supposed to sign my
discharge papers after her appy.

53
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,885
Good. You know, go home,
get better and then come back,

54
00:03:17,984 --> 00:03:20,781
- 'cause I need you.
- Are the mercy west people that bad?

55
00:03:20,886 --> 00:03:22,884
They're everywhere and there
are more of them than us,

56
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:25,531
And they're kicking our asses.
God, I miss izzie.

57
00:03:25,621 --> 00:03:29,531
- We need more "uses," so get back here.
- I have to be discharged first.

58
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,177
- You want to forge bailey's signature?
- No, that'll get me fired.

59
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:35,464
Ask one of the new ones
to do it. Get them fired.

60
00:03:38,304 --> 00:03:39,586
Time-out's over.

61
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,656
Well, send bailey.

62
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,050
Try to keep the burn unit
and the trauma rooms clear.

63
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:47,584
And call respiratory.
We need ventilators on standby.

64
00:03:47,681 --> 00:03:49,636
I got a burn victim
and her kid.

65
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,506
- Take your pick.
- Yang, come with me.

66
00:03:53,594 --> 00:03:55,750
- We can help.
- Great. Here. Take these.

67
00:03:55,825 --> 00:03:57,093
<i>I handed it off.</i>

68
00:03:57,183 --> 00:03:58,667
To who? Who did you
hand it to?

69
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,377
I have no idea.

70
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,656
- I got her chart.
- yang, come with me.

71
00:04:13,897 --> 00:04:14,924
We can help.

72
00:04:15,551 --> 00:04:18,263
Great. Here.
Take these.

73
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:20,890
Sucks.

74
00:04:21,057 --> 00:04:23,012
Yang's turfing us
all the crap cases

75
00:04:23,095 --> 00:04:24,888
While she runs outside
for the good ones.

76
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:30,409
Cathy Becker?

77
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:33,254
- Yes, hi.
- And you must be danny.

78
00:04:33,362 --> 00:04:35,371
I'm dr. Adamson. Can you
come this way with me?

79
00:04:36,011 --> 00:04:37,922
Okay, sweetie. Come on.
All right.

80
00:04:39,254 --> 00:04:41,155
We were driving
up to vancouver

81
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:43,994
To visit my husband.
He's up there for work.

82
00:04:44,077 --> 00:04:46,013
And the rain wouldn't let up,
so we thought, you know,

83
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:47,950
Why don't we just
stop for the night?

84
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,601
Bet you wish
you kept driving ?

85
00:04:50,212 --> 00:04:53,148
All right, can you lean forward...
And take a deep breath.

86
00:04:55,474 --> 00:04:56,835
I'm glad you made it out.

87
00:04:57,026 --> 00:04:59,739
- Thank god we were on the first floor.
- I was scared.

88
00:04:59,858 --> 00:05:02,084
My mom getted burned.

89
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:03,997
Mommy's all right,
baby. You're safe.

90
00:05:04,124 --> 00:05:06,836
- Everybody is all right, okay?
- Everybody's safe now.

91
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:08,856
- Can you say "ahh" for me?
- Ahh.

92
00:05:09,361 --> 00:05:10,236
Very good.

93
00:05:13,336 --> 00:05:15,008
See? One for them.

94
00:05:16,818 --> 00:05:18,080
and one for us.

95
00:05:18,163 --> 00:05:19,481
Stop being so paranoid.

96
00:05:19,564 --> 00:05:21,067
They hate us.

97
00:05:21,214 --> 00:05:22,940
It doesn't matter how good
we are, we're gonna fail

98
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:24,639
Because they were here first
and they rule the school

99
00:05:24,722 --> 00:05:28,005
- And they hate us.
- I'm not gonna let them turn me into someone they can hate.

100
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,983
- I'm easy to like.
- Actually, it takes a while. I hated you at first.

101
00:05:34,106 --> 00:05:35,241
Just shut up.

102
00:05:35,324 --> 00:05:36,102
Sorry.

103
00:05:37,622 --> 00:05:39,977
Okay. Your lungs sound good.

104
00:05:40,062 --> 00:05:41,297
Your vitals are great.

105
00:05:41,993 --> 00:05:43,264
Open up, please.

106
00:05:43,393 --> 00:05:44,695
Oh, my god.

107
00:05:49,014 --> 00:05:50,774
Well, charlie got a good one.

108
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,215
See? We win.

109
00:05:54,361 --> 00:05:56,605
Okay. You look good.

110
00:05:56,688 --> 00:05:58,440
These burns on your chest
are pretty minor.

111
00:05:58,523 --> 00:06:00,042
But the one on your calf
might be third-degree,

112
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:03,183
So what I'm gonna do,
hang on one second. Dr. Sloan.

113
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:05,229
I'm just gonna have
the plastic surgeon

114
00:06:05,313 --> 00:06:06,903
Come and take a look, okay?

115
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,953
I just did her initial exam.

116
00:06:10,523 --> 00:06:12,986
She was a burn patient
and she wasn't surgical.

117
00:06:13,074 --> 00:06:16,172
- There was--there was nothing more for me to do for her.
- And at that point, you went

118
00:06:16,262 --> 00:06:17,476
I went to go help dr. Bailey.

119
00:06:23,542 --> 00:06:25,288
What did I just say?!

120
00:06:26,822 --> 00:06:27,849
I got it!

121
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,653
Dr. Bailey really needed
some help.

122
00:06:38,302 --> 00:06:39,379
He fainted.

123
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,275
He fainted?
He fainted.

124
00:06:41,358 --> 00:06:43,686
- From what?
- Better have a brain tumor or something,

125
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,008
'cause that's
just unacceptable.

126
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:48,689
There was a blood drive today.

127
00:06:51,714 --> 00:06:53,253
This place
is a freakin' maze.

128
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,687
I've gotten lost, like,
11 times. No joke.

129
00:06:55,912 --> 00:06:57,833
- I lost a patient.
- That's bad, dude.

130
00:06:57,922 --> 00:07:00,703
- How'd  die?
- No, I lost her. Parked her in a hallway,

131
00:07:00,781 --> 00:07:02,964
Went to get her labs,
couldn't find the hallway.

132
00:07:03,036 --> 00:07:06,115
- Of course, no one would help me.
- Yeah, don't even ask for help.

133
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,428
These seattle grace people
are kinda douchey.

134
00:07:15,997 --> 00:07:17,034
Case in point.

135
00:07:17,258 --> 00:07:18,110
Douche.

136
00:07:22,056 --> 00:07:24,529
It's the e.R.
Mass casualty.

137
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,736
Hey, I need to,

138
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:31,428
Emergency. I'm a surgeon.
Hello.

139
00:07:31,548 --> 00:07:34,344
Apparently, he grabbed
the fire ax out of the case

140
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:36,387
and tried to run down
the stairs with it.

141
00:07:36,467 --> 00:07:38,530
Mom was right.
No running on the stairs.

142
00:07:41,997 --> 00:07:44,422
Okay, on my count--
one, two, three.

143
00:07:46,014 --> 00:07:48,182
Okay, I want a c.B.C.,
chem panel,

144
00:07:48,265 --> 00:07:51,075
And make sure there's an o.R.
Ready--wait, wait. Just stop.

145
00:07:51,796 --> 00:07:54,115
I need to see
what I'm looking at.

146
00:07:54,254 --> 00:07:57,341
- You have steady hands?
- Yes, ma'am. In college, I was

147
00:07:57,424 --> 00:08:00,725
I don't want your life story.
I need both hands on this handle.

148
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:05,729
Do not push the ax in.
Do not pull the ax out.

149
00:08:05,857 --> 00:08:07,756
Do not move. Understand?

150
00:08:07,901 --> 00:08:08,662
Yep.

151
00:08:11,144 --> 00:08:13,934
In retrospect,
I should've had a cookie.

152
00:08:23,648 --> 00:08:26,674
Stupid.
Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid.

153
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:29,448
What did I just say?

154
00:08:29,561 --> 00:08:30,580
I got it!

155
00:08:31,335 --> 00:08:32,791
Here. Apply pressure.

156
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,773
Okay, come with me.

157
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,044
Hey, karev.

158
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:42,221
Clean that up.

159
00:08:48,965 --> 00:08:52,866
- And that was the last you saw of the patient?
- Yes, with dr. Sloan, who treated her burn.

160
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:56,303
- No, he didn't. I treated her burn.
- You did? Where was sloan?

161
00:08:57,366 --> 00:08:59,089
Karev, clean that up.

162
00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:00,747
Okay, ready?

163
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:03,952
One, two, three, four,
I declare a thumb war. Go.

164
00:09:04,035 --> 00:09:06,587
I'd say this is
deep second-degree.

165
00:09:06,912 --> 00:09:10,806
Why don't you start cleaning
while I finish debriding?

166
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:11,907
Does it hurt?

167
00:09:12,453 --> 00:09:14,660
Yeah, a little bit, sweetie.
But it's okay.

168
00:09:14,743 --> 00:09:16,457
The doctors are making it
all better.

169
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,598
All right, now you gotta watch
or I'm gonna get you.

170
00:09:20,421 --> 00:09:23,086
- Dr. Sloan, need you.
- All right, finish debriding,

171
00:09:23,157 --> 00:09:25,446
Cover the entire wound
with silver sulfadiazine,

172
00:09:25,535 --> 00:09:28,698
- Then loose gauze loose, not too tight.
- I got it, I got it.

173
00:09:30,035 --> 00:09:32,249
Evan lang, 16, second-
and third-degree burns

174
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:33,488
Over 60% of his body.

175
00:09:34,137 --> 00:09:36,702
Grey. Come on when you're done,
'cause we need hands.

176
00:09:43,034 --> 00:09:45,109
So robbins was rushing you?
You felt rushed?

177
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,361
No. I-I didn't rush.
I took my time.

178
00:09:55,689 --> 00:09:57,446
Sorry. I know it hurts.

179
00:09:58,359 --> 00:10:00,083
No. No.

180
00:10:00,196 --> 00:10:02,203
I'm fine. Come here.

181
00:10:02,988 --> 00:10:04,543
I'm just fine.

182
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,359
<i>And then I joined
dr. Sloan and dr. Robbins.</i>

183
00:10:11,348 --> 00:10:13,296
Okay, this is all set.

184
00:10:13,896 --> 00:10:15,693
I'm sorry. Sorry.

185
00:10:15,787 --> 00:10:18,554
- Are you free? I need a hand.
- Yeah, I'll be right there.

186
00:10:18,678 --> 00:10:20,353
It's okay.
You're okay.

187
00:10:20,482 --> 00:10:21,848
We're just gonna examine you,

188
00:10:21,951 --> 00:10:24,443
And then we're gonna get you
warmed up again, okay ?

189
00:10:28,177 --> 00:10:29,086
My dad.

190
00:10:29,501 --> 00:10:32,958
- Where is my dad?
- You just give me his name, and we'll find him ?

191
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,788
'cause he's gotta be looking
for you, too.

192
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,442
Here. For the smell.

193
00:10:42,853 --> 00:10:43,834
Listen...

194
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:47,819
Burns like this
are really... Difficult.

195
00:10:48,342 --> 00:10:51,588
You don't really...
You wanna switch with someone--

196
00:10:51,675 --> 00:10:53,972
- Karev or somebody?
- You think I can't handle this?

197
00:10:54,061 --> 00:10:57,890
-  No, no, no, I...
- Because I can. I'm good. I'm here.

198
00:10:58,623 --> 00:11:01,065
<i>So you stayed with the burn patien
in the trauma room?t</i>

199
00:11:01,148 --> 00:11:05,224
- I... Yeah, I did.
- And who was with mrs. Becker?

200
00:11:05,308 --> 00:11:07,605
<i>Reed adamson.
Okay, this is all set.</i>

201
00:11:07,715 --> 00:11:10,329
No, I was never
with mrs. Becker.

202
00:11:10,454 --> 00:11:11,974
I was with her little boy.

203
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:14,214
I had just finished with him, actually.

204
00:11:14,702 --> 00:11:18,114
- Oh! I'm sorry. Sorry.
- Are you free? I need a hand.

205
00:11:18,197 --> 00:11:20,246
Yeah, I'll be right there.
Okay.

206
00:11:21,505 --> 00:11:22,942
So good news, big guy.

207
00:11:23,025 --> 00:11:24,328
You are fine.

208
00:11:24,447 --> 00:11:27,999
His pulse-ox looks good.
Everything looks good.

209
00:11:28,107 --> 00:11:29,188
He's totally fine.

210
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:30,309
Thank you.

211
00:11:31,703 --> 00:11:33,493
Can he stay in here
with me,

212
00:11:33,611 --> 00:11:34,901
Just until his dad comes?

213
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,959
Yeah, no problem.
It's a full house anyway.

214
00:11:38,805 --> 00:11:40,449
So I went to help dr. Torres.

215
00:11:41,096 --> 00:11:44,416
Roy macinaw, 56-year-old firefighter.
Fell three stories from a ladder.

216
00:11:44,499 --> 00:11:46,198
Looks like a hip
and femur fracture.

217
00:11:46,281 --> 00:11:48,928
- Maybe radius, too. He's waking up.
- What happened?

218
00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:53,681
I had him.
I-I got--I got to the window.

219
00:11:53,795 --> 00:11:56,548
Roy, roy, you fell from
the ladder. It was a bad fall.

220
00:11:56,631 --> 00:11:57,802
But we're gonna fix you up.

221
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:59,370
Give him 10 of morphine
and get him admitted.

222
00:11:59,909 --> 00:12:03,234
Where's the kid? I had him.
He was going after a kid?

223
00:12:03,325 --> 00:12:04,681
- Shepherd.
- Yeah.

224
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:07,487
- He has uneven pupils.
- Abdomen's rigid. He's gonna need an ultrasound.

225
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,222
Yeah. He's gonna need
a head c.T., too.

226
00:12:11,305 --> 00:12:13,204
- Page me when you get his scans.
- He needs everything.

227
00:12:13,287 --> 00:12:15,654
- Let's take him now. Let's go.
- Ready? Let's go.

228
00:12:15,737 --> 00:12:18,288
<i>- And you left the e.R. At that point?
- I took him to x-ray, yes.</i>

229
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,640
Did you ever hear mrs. Becker
say anything about pain?

230
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:21,676
No.

231
00:12:22,321 --> 00:12:23,242
The nurse did.

232
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,129
He said
she was in a lot of pain.

233
00:12:25,246 --> 00:12:28,108
- Whose patient is bed one, Cathy becker?
- Not mine.

234
00:12:28,265 --> 00:12:29,876
She's complaining
of pain.

235
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:33,757
<i>At this point,
who was in charge</i>

236
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,177
Of mrs. Becker's care?
Whose patient was she?

237
00:12:36,311 --> 00:12:39,453
- I was never on her.
- I was in the o.R. With dr. Bailey.

238
00:12:39,572 --> 00:12:41,299
- I'm not--I-I don't--
- not mine.

239
00:12:41,382 --> 00:12:43,869
- No idea.
- Did you order pain meds?

240
00:12:43,989 --> 00:12:45,198
No, yang did.

241
00:12:46,942 --> 00:12:48,194
Next time I saw her,

242
00:12:48,527 --> 00:12:50,832
She was...
She was dying.

243
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:06,332
When you saw her,
she was dying?

244
00:13:06,478 --> 00:13:09,658
No, she wasn't dying.
She said she had some pain.

245
00:13:09,762 --> 00:13:12,827
- Whose patient is bed one, Cathy becker?
- Not mine.

246
00:13:12,904 --> 00:13:14,467
She's complaining of pain.

247
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,272
Hey, karev.
You got bed one?

248
00:13:20,354 --> 00:13:22,141
- No.
- Your initials are on the chart, man.

249
00:13:23,952 --> 00:13:25,313
<i>So you checked
with karev?</i>

250
00:13:25,396 --> 00:13:28,349
- I tried to. He was on the phone.
- I had never even seen that patient.

251
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:31,047
- I-I was stitching up nosedive.
- Nosedive?

252
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:33,992
What's his name? The--the dude
that fainted.

253
00:13:34,118 --> 00:13:36,129
- Dr. Percy.
- Nosedive.

254
00:13:36,675 --> 00:13:37,987
That's gonna stick.

255
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,440
So you were with
dr. Percy?

256
00:13:40,523 --> 00:13:42,049
He was supposed to be.

257
00:13:43,153 --> 00:13:44,780
- Hey, karev, you have bed one?
-No.

258
00:13:44,863 --> 00:13:46,335
Your initials
are on the chart.

259
00:13:47,933 --> 00:13:51,672
Iz, I'm done.
I'm done leaving you messages.

260
00:13:51,755 --> 00:13:54,315
I'm done talking to your mom,
who's probably lying to me.

261
00:13:54,398 --> 00:13:55,916
Are you gonna
help me with this?

262
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:59,569
Listen,
it's been a week, iz.

263
00:13:59,694 --> 00:14:01,882
And I don't know
if you're alive or dead.

264
00:14:01,965 --> 00:14:03,884
So if I don't hear from you
by tonight,

265
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:05,425
I am calling the police

266
00:14:05,508 --> 00:14:07,995
And I'm reporting you
as a missing person.

267
00:14:18,028 --> 00:14:20,513
- So who gave her the morphine?
- No idea.

268
00:14:20,837 --> 00:14:22,186
I never even saw her.

269
00:14:23,398 --> 00:14:25,330
I ordered it. I did.

270
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:27,458
Your initials
are on the chart.

271
00:14:29,294 --> 00:14:30,853
How long
do I have to work here

272
00:14:30,956 --> 00:14:32,503
Before they insert a bug up my ass?

273
00:14:33,603 --> 00:14:35,136
You guys are all so cranky.

274
00:14:35,938 --> 00:14:38,512
<i>Dr. Avery
seemed uncomfortable</i>

275
00:14:38,598 --> 00:14:40,767
Consulting on a patient
that wasn't his.

276
00:14:40,888 --> 00:14:43,135
<i>So I checked with the patient
and asked her about her pain,</i>

277
00:14:43,244 --> 00:14:45,619
<i>And she said it was localized
to her chest burns.</i>

278
00:14:45,702 --> 00:14:48,994
<i>So I checked her chart for any
allergies or drug interactions</i>

279
00:14:49,077 --> 00:14:51,371
<i>And saw that she had
silver sulfadiazine</i>

280
00:14:51,912 --> 00:14:55,001
<i>D 1 gram of cefazolin
and 800 of ibuprofen,</i>

281
00:14:55,109 --> 00:14:56,979
So I ordered 2 of morphine.

282
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:01,066
- You memorized her chart?
- Yeah, I checked it three times 'cause she wasn't my patient.

283
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:03,330
So you ordered the morphine.
Did you follow up ?

284
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,826
No. My patient
had come back from c.T.

285
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,199
All right, people, people,
listen up.

286
00:15:09,282 --> 00:15:10,788
The burn unit
and the I.C.U. Are full.

287
00:15:10,871 --> 00:15:13,257
All patients are staying here
until some beds open up,

288
00:15:13,338 --> 00:15:15,343
All right?
Let's keep
the trauma rooms clear

289
00:15:15,454 --> 00:15:18,345
- For the burn cases, please.
- Head c.T. Was fine.

290
00:15:18,428 --> 00:15:21,091
Abdominal scans show a liver lac
and possible kidney hematoma.

291
00:15:21,182 --> 00:15:23,541
I'm gonna check on an o.R.
Page me when he's stable.

292
00:15:26,724 --> 00:15:27,638
That's him.

293
00:15:27,775 --> 00:15:30,122
The kid--
the kid in the window.

294
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,876
Is he dying?

295
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:34,354
I don't know
what he's here for

296
00:15:34,454 --> 00:15:36,435
He's fine, roy.
He's being taken care of.

297
00:15:36,582 --> 00:15:38,224
- You saved his life.
- Oh, no.

298
00:15:38,885 --> 00:15:39,581
No.

299
00:15:40,258 --> 00:15:41,487
I killed him.

300
00:15:43,704 --> 00:15:45,025
<i>Can I ask something?</i>

301
00:15:45,897 --> 00:15:48,712
You say the patient asked for
meds for pains in her chest?

302
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:50,860
No, on her chest.
She had burns.

303
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:53,143
All right, thank you,
dr. Yang.

304
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,451
Are you saying
that she had chest pains,

305
00:15:55,534 --> 00:15:57,609
That I ordered the wrong medication?
It's hard to say.

306
00:15:57,692 --> 00:15:59,471
The next entry on her chart
was dr. Grey

307
00:15:59,554 --> 00:16:01,575
- Putting in a chest tube, so
- Thank you, dr. Yang.

308
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,921
- Meredith?
-No, lexie.

309
00:16:05,067 --> 00:16:07,642
- Well, I thought lexie was on the burn--
- Thank you, dr. Yang.

310
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:10,362
I was.

311
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:12,583
I was supposed to be
with the burn ki-- with evan Lang

312
00:16:15,838 --> 00:16:17,348
All right, people, listen up.

313
00:16:17,431 --> 00:16:19,206
The burn unit
and the I.C.U. Are full.

314
00:16:19,289 --> 00:16:21,183
All patients are staying here
until some more beds open up,

315
00:16:21,266 --> 00:16:23,055
- All right?
- Let's keep the trauma rooms clear

316
00:16:23,138 --> 00:16:25,108
For the burn cases, please.

317
00:16:27,378 --> 00:16:31,131
- I can't get a pulse on the doppler.
- I have to do an escharotomy.

318
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,573
Noi have to cut into
the burned skin

319
00:16:32,695 --> 00:16:35,983
- To restore circulation to your arm ok?
- Did you find my dad?

320
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:37,976
You know what?
I'll ask again in a sec, okay?

321
00:16:38,059 --> 00:16:39,318
Push another 25 of fentanyl.

322
00:16:39,401 --> 00:16:41,546
Evan, you're just gonna
talk to me, okay?

323
00:16:42,214 --> 00:16:46,577
- So you said you're in town looking at a college?
- Yeah, I got a scholarship to cornish.

324
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:49,360
I'm not sure I can take
the rain.

325
00:16:55,818 --> 00:16:57,132
No! No!

326
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,709
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I know. You're okay, pal.

327
00:16:59,792 --> 00:17:02,325
- You're gonna be okay.
- That's what I thought at first, too

328
00:17:02,411 --> 00:17:05,294
About the rain. Dr. Grey,
you grew up here, right?

329
00:17:05,377 --> 00:17:06,787
So you get used
to the rain?

330
00:17:09,216 --> 00:17:10,243
Lexie.

331
00:17:11,814 --> 00:17:14,949
Dr. Grey, step out. Come back
when you've got it together.

332
00:17:15,032 --> 00:17:15,716
Go.

333
00:17:25,603 --> 00:17:26,785
She can't breathe.

334
00:17:26,868 --> 00:17:27,932
It's okay. I'm okay.

335
00:17:28,015 --> 00:17:30,276
My mom.
She can't breathe.

336
00:17:38,854 --> 00:17:40,543
It was a pneumothorax.

337
00:17:41,709 --> 00:17:44,332
- What's that?
- Her lung collapsed.

338
00:17:46,327 --> 00:17:49,226
One, two, three.

339
00:17:49,467 --> 00:17:52,161
Danny... Don't let him
see me die.

340
00:17:52,251 --> 00:17:53,888
You're not gonna die.
I promise.

341
00:17:54,438 --> 00:17:57,700
<i>One, two, three.
you got the chest tube in?</i>

342
00:17:57,806 --> 00:18:00,920
- No, I was getting there. I was counting
- did you go in below the fifth intercostal space?

343
00:18:00,992 --> 00:18:04,113
- You could've punctured her diaphragm.
- I know--I just-- I lost count.

344
00:18:04,229 --> 00:18:05,024
Why ?

345
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:06,841
Four...

346
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,221
Did you get
the chest tube in?

347
00:18:17,426 --> 00:18:21,263
- I did. I-I did. I-I just...
- She did. She just missed a step.

348
00:18:21,346 --> 00:18:24,533
One, two, three,
four, f--

349
00:18:29,923 --> 00:18:31,124
Why did you do that?

350
00:18:31,207 --> 00:18:33,231
I had to, okay?
She was running out of time.

351
00:18:33,314 --> 00:18:35,758
It was a tension pneumothorax.
You have to relieve the pressure

352
00:18:35,841 --> 00:18:37,916
So that she doesn't croak before
you put the chest tube in.

353
00:18:39,626 --> 00:18:42,240
- Do you want me to do it?
- No, I-I can do it. I-I got it.

354
00:18:43,317 --> 00:18:46,220
Three, four, five.

355
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:48,612
<i>- And did she have it?
- Yeah, I watched.</i>

356
00:18:48,782 --> 00:18:51,855
- She--she was a little distracted, but--
- You were distracted?

357
00:18:51,981 --> 00:18:54,590
- What were you--
- dr. Yang was making a toddler cry.

358
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:55,821
Stop!

359
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,134
What the hell
are you doing?

360
00:19:01,438 --> 00:19:03,043
<i>Okay, let me just say
for the record</i>

361
00:19:03,161 --> 00:19:05,094
That it was no toddler.

362
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:07,254
- He was, like, 5 if he was a day.
- Yang

363
00:19:07,337 --> 00:19:09,772
- You would've yelled at him, too.
- Why was he there in the first place?

364
00:19:09,855 --> 00:19:13,130
- I don't know how he got there. The patient was coding and--
- the patient was coding?

365
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:16,509
- Coags are stable.
- Good, o.R. Is ready.

366
00:19:16,592 --> 00:19:19,200
Yang, you're with me.
Torres, adamson will call you

367
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:22,496
- When we're ready for the femur.
- Roy, your whole crew's in the waiting room.

368
00:19:22,603 --> 00:19:24,753
They'll see you after.
They're saying you're a hero.

369
00:19:25,603 --> 00:19:29,417
Tell him I'm sorry.
Tell him I'm so sorry.

370
00:19:29,563 --> 00:19:33,574
- Who is he talking about?
- The kid in trauma 2. Roy, he's fine.

371
00:19:33,675 --> 00:19:36,795
- He's gonna be--
- Almost had him. I was at the window.

372
00:19:36,921 --> 00:19:39,129
I could feel his fingers
in my hand.

373
00:19:39,256 --> 00:19:42,703
I went to pull him out,
and--and I missed a step.

374
00:19:42,811 --> 00:19:46,357
- One stupid mistake.
- You fell, roy. It was an accident.

375
00:19:46,442 --> 00:19:47,545
He was burning.

376
00:19:48,742 --> 00:19:50,194
And then I went...

377
00:19:51,911 --> 00:19:52,843
V-tach.

378
00:19:52,969 --> 00:19:55,794
- No pulse.
- Start c.P.R. Bag him. Push one of epi.

379
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:57,382
Charging to 200.

380
00:20:02,718 --> 00:20:04,649
Or that works, too.

381
00:20:06,082 --> 00:20:07,602
thanks. Had it.

382
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:12,434
Stop!

383
00:20:13,535 --> 00:20:14,932
Wwhat the hell are you doing?

384
00:20:16,613 --> 00:20:19,425
- Who was watching that kid ?
- that's what I said.

385
00:20:19,508 --> 00:20:21,746
Hey, hey, who's watching
this kid?

386
00:20:21,869 --> 00:20:25,235
I took the kid.
He was with me, but I-I can't watch him.

387
00:20:25,318 --> 00:20:26,805
I'm supposed to be
in trauma 2.

388
00:20:38,345 --> 00:20:40,111
All right, I-I-I got him.
I'll take him.

389
00:20:41,843 --> 00:20:42,688
Come on.

390
00:20:45,406 --> 00:20:47,284
<i>- And you lefthis mother alone?
- She was stable,</i>

391
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:49,209
And--and I was supposed
to be with the boy.

392
00:20:49,296 --> 00:20:51,946
- But his mother had a collapsed lung.
- No, no, no, not that boy.

393
00:20:52,013 --> 00:20:53,138
I was supposed to be
with the other boy.

394
00:20:53,261 --> 00:20:56,488
- You want something sweet for dinner?
- What the hell are you doing?

395
00:20:57,091 --> 00:20:58,686
I have to sit with him
until his dad comes.

396
00:20:58,770 --> 00:20:59,960
I left him alone--

397
00:21:00,043 --> 00:21:02,702
No, you left him.
Come here.

398
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:05,609
Can you sit with him
until his dad comes? Thanks.

399
00:21:09,318 --> 00:21:11,597
You left him alone.
When were you planning to--

400
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,158
- I'm s--I'm sorry. I just-- I-I feel like--
- No, you don't get to feel anything

401
00:21:15,648 --> 00:21:17,263
Because he's feeling
everything.

402
00:21:17,362 --> 00:21:19,737
His every nerve is exposed
and raw, and we have to

403
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,662
Make him feel worse
before he's gonna feel better.

404
00:21:22,075 --> 00:21:24,921
So if you're having feelings,
then you need tohut them down.

405
00:21:24,986 --> 00:21:27,038
You need to shut them down
and talk to him about his future

406
00:21:27,139 --> 00:21:29,278
And remind him that he has one
past all of this pain.

407
00:21:29,361 --> 00:21:32,169
And if you can't do that,
if you can't do your job,

408
00:21:32,267 --> 00:21:34,796
Then you find someone who can
and you send them to me.

409
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:38,694
<i>Did you see
mrs. Becker again?</i>

410
00:21:39,344 --> 00:21:41,956
- No.
- Did you see karev perform
an emergency cricothyrotomy?

411
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:43,332
I wasn't there.

412
00:21:43,391 --> 00:21:45,199
I was right there.
I saw it.

413
00:21:45,307 --> 00:21:47,168
Then you find someone who can
and you send them to me.

414
00:21:50,554 --> 00:21:52,990
Have you seen karev?
He didn't finish my stitches.

415
00:21:53,102 --> 00:21:54,777
No, I-I-I don't...

416
00:21:58,999 --> 00:22:01,039
Doctor, she's not breathing.

417
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,242
Move. Move, move, move.
Get me a 7 e.T. Tube.

418
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:11,258
Ah. Oh, crap.

419
00:22:11,341 --> 00:22:13,887
She's completely closed off.
I can't see her cords.

420
00:22:13,982 --> 00:22:18,277
- You can't intubate a patient?
- Of course I can, I just... I was having trouble.

421
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,072
Her airway
was completely closed off.

422
00:22:20,176 --> 00:22:21,371
I mean,
I couldn't tube her either.

423
00:22:22,501 --> 00:22:23,647
What's going on?

424
00:22:26,077 --> 00:22:27,465
There's too much swelling
in the airway.

425
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:30,306
- Get me a smaller tube, a 6-0.
- 6-0. Here you go.

426
00:22:33,473 --> 00:22:35,139
- Damn it.
- Move!

427
00:22:35,255 --> 00:22:39,675
- Did karev try to intubate?
- First charles tried to tube her, then reed came to help,

428
00:22:39,777 --> 00:22:42,409
- And then karev performed the crike.
- I thought you didn't see it.

429
00:22:42,521 --> 00:22:43,581
I did. I--

430
00:22:43,664 --> 00:22:45,151
And you didn't try
and help?

431
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,402
There's too much swelling
in the airway.

432
00:22:48,522 --> 00:22:53,004
- Get me a smaller tube, a 6-0.
- 6-0. Here you go.

433
00:22:53,963 --> 00:22:56,101
Move!
She needs a crike.

434
00:23:05,496 --> 00:23:06,968
My patient needed me.

435
00:23:10,281 --> 00:23:12,636
Here's the thing
about the rain--

436
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:16,025
It usually just drizzles.
It's--it's not like tonight.

437
00:23:16,118 --> 00:23:17,577
But when it stops,

438
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:20,375
Everything is super green,

439
00:23:20,489 --> 00:23:23,785
And it's beautiful,
and it smells like trees.

440
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:25,661
You know that smell?

441
00:23:32,729 --> 00:23:34,725
Dr. Karev seemed to have it
under control.

442
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:38,205
- Karev seemed totally out of control.
- Move! She needs a crike.

443
00:23:38,317 --> 00:23:39,464
Get me an ambu bag.

444
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,639
<i>He was pale, shaky, just...
Really unsteady.</i>

445
00:23:44,767 --> 00:23:46,611
She's got no landmarks.
I was hoping that...

446
00:23:47,474 --> 00:23:48,758
What are you--

447
00:23:48,872 --> 00:23:50,400
You're going in blind?

448
00:23:54,765 --> 00:23:56,216
Hit the carotid.

449
00:23:56,481 --> 00:23:58,619
<i>- Hit the carotid.
and he kept saying something</i>

450
00:23:58,725 --> 00:24:00,804
About hitting her carotid.

451
00:24:16,846 --> 00:24:18,667
Did you
give blood today, dr. Karev?

452
00:24:20,154 --> 00:24:22,051
- What?
- You've been described as looking,

453
00:24:22,131 --> 00:24:24,358
"pale, shaky and unsteady."

454
00:24:24,977 --> 00:24:27,213
We already had one doctor
pass out after giving blood.

455
00:24:27,296 --> 00:24:29,150
- I'm asking--
- We all give blood.

456
00:24:29,249 --> 00:24:30,932
- Avery gave blood,
- yang gave blood,

457
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:32,412
Grey gave blood.

458
00:24:33,032 --> 00:24:34,493
I give blood
every two months.

459
00:24:34,611 --> 00:24:36,664
Just because some dumb-ass
didn't eat a cookie--

460
00:24:36,783 --> 00:24:39,565
I'm asking if you
gave blood today, dr. Karev.

461
00:24:46,755 --> 00:24:47,494
No.

462
00:24:49,033 --> 00:24:50,965
And you haven't
heard from her since then?

463
00:24:54,288 --> 00:24:56,519
You'll tell me
if she calls?

464
00:24:57,759 --> 00:24:58,559
Right.

465
00:24:59,605 --> 00:25:00,786
I know, robbie.

466
00:25:01,649 --> 00:25:02,524
Thanks.

467
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,992
These seattle grace
people are kinda douchey.

468
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:12,263
Case in point.

469
00:25:12,346 --> 00:25:13,150
Douche.

470
00:25:16,497 --> 00:25:17,327
Wait, wait.

471
00:25:18,357 --> 00:25:20,949
Don't stick me.
I gotta go. Sorry.

472
00:25:22,273 --> 00:25:23,617
<i>So what was the problem?</i>

473
00:25:24,209 --> 00:25:26,312
- There was no problem.
- There was a problem.

474
00:25:26,451 --> 00:25:28,711
I came back from seeing
the firefighter off to surgery.

475
00:25:33,219 --> 00:25:35,988
My guys would like
to line the hall for roy

476
00:25:36,071 --> 00:25:37,371
When he comes out of surgery.

477
00:25:37,454 --> 00:25:38,971
You know,
make a show of support.

478
00:25:39,101 --> 00:25:43,621
- He's, 35 years on the job, so we figured we would--
- That's great. That's,

479
00:25:43,673 --> 00:25:46,307
<i>Ex-excuse me.
and there was a problem,</i>

480
00:25:46,405 --> 00:25:49,558
- And charles waved me over to help.
- No, I wasn't waving at reed.

481
00:25:49,652 --> 00:25:53,564
- I was waving at karev, but he wouldn't get off the phone.
- He what?

482
00:25:53,658 --> 00:25:55,798
Oh, crap.
She's completely closed off.

483
00:25:55,881 --> 00:25:57,068
I can't see her cords.

484
00:25:57,183 --> 00:25:58,860
Come home
so we can talk.

485
00:26:00,061 --> 00:26:03,273
- I hung up the phone.
- What the hell was so important, karev?

486
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:06,242
I hung up the phone,
I came over and I criked her.

487
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:09,007
After another doctor got there
first. A patient was dying.

488
00:26:09,128 --> 00:26:10,546
- I hung up... the phone.

489
00:26:12,507 --> 00:26:15,735
Yeah, that--oh, that's
good and tight there.

490
00:26:23,485 --> 00:26:24,922
Hello. Izzie?

491
00:26:30,968 --> 00:26:32,062
Hello, iz.

492
00:26:33,171 --> 00:26:35,591
- Hey.
- Where are you? Are you okay?

493
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:38,348
No, I know. Your mom--
your mom, she said she--

494
00:26:38,494 --> 00:26:40,124
You left him alone.

495
00:26:40,219 --> 00:26:42,474
- When were you planning to--
- I'm sorry. I feel like--

496
00:26:42,498 --> 00:26:44,004
I'm asking you
to wait, please.

497
00:26:45,365 --> 00:26:47,339
No, I got--look, just wait.

498
00:26:48,493 --> 00:26:50,726
- Iz... Just come home.
- Doctor!

499
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:52,566
- Come home and we can talk about it.

500
00:26:52,649 --> 00:26:55,876
- Move, move, move. Get me a 7 e.T. Tube.
- Wait, what does that mean?

501
00:26:55,959 --> 00:26:58,034
- Coming through.
- You're not coming back yet

502
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:00,537
Or you're not coming back?

503
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:03,498
Just wait, wait, wait.

504
00:27:07,487 --> 00:27:08,871
Iz, just give me a number.

505
00:27:08,954 --> 00:27:10,811
Give me a number,
and I'll call you back.

506
00:27:10,894 --> 00:27:14,553
Give me a number so--I have to--
look, just give me a number.

507
00:27:14,654 --> 00:27:16,735
- Iz
- Get me a smaller tube, a 6-0.

508
00:27:17,365 --> 00:27:18,215
I--wait.

509
00:27:19,649 --> 00:27:21,144
Izzie, just--
damn it.

510
00:27:22,834 --> 00:27:24,736
Move! She needs a crike.

511
00:27:25,265 --> 00:27:26,351
Ambu bag.

512
00:27:27,341 --> 00:27:30,198
She's got no landmarks.
I was hoping that she would--

513
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,149
What are you--
you're going in blind?

514
00:27:37,584 --> 00:27:39,465
Don't hit the carotid.
Don't hit the carotid.

515
00:27:39,565 --> 00:27:42,001
Don't hit the carotid.

516
00:27:42,078 --> 00:27:43,973
Don't hit the carotid.

517
00:27:52,895 --> 00:27:55,550
Got it.
Start ventilating.

518
00:28:06,671 --> 00:28:08,077
I got there in time.

519
00:28:08,673 --> 00:28:09,914
I did the crike.

520
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,550
I got off the phone.

521
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:22,705
<i>- I stayed with her after that.
- And at that point, you had her under control.</i>

522
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,274
<i>It was a good crike.
She was stable.</i>

523
00:28:25,406 --> 00:28:28,412
<i>Then out of nowhere,
we started to lose her.</i>

524
00:28:28,529 --> 00:28:29,855
She's got pulmonary edema.

525
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,585
Switch to high-frequency
jet ventilation.

526
00:28:31,686 --> 00:28:33,409
Get a c.B.C.,
lytes, a.B.G.--

527
00:28:33,517 --> 00:28:37,344
Just shotgun her,
get everything. She had a.R.D.S.

528
00:28:37,437 --> 00:28:40,259
B.P. Was dropping. We started
fluids. She was sinking fast.

529
00:28:40,726 --> 00:28:42,543
Trauma 1 is clear.
We should move her.

530
00:28:42,635 --> 00:28:44,560
- What happened? Why is she--
- I-I don't know.

531
00:28:45,018 --> 00:28:46,858
Hey, can you give me a hand?

532
00:28:51,034 --> 00:28:53,725
- Somebody page hunt and get me those labs.
- I got her labs.

533
00:28:53,825 --> 00:28:55,114
I was shocked.

534
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,827
You're a.K., right?

535
00:28:58,469 --> 00:28:59,407
April kepner?

536
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:01,448
No, no. This is alex karev.

537
00:29:02,756 --> 00:29:04,205
Wait a second.
What the hell?

538
00:29:04,902 --> 00:29:06,781
Her carbon monoxide
level was 28,

539
00:29:06,864 --> 00:29:08,221
And she was spiraling down.

540
00:29:09,155 --> 00:29:10,196
what the hell?

541
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:13,470
B.P. Is 69 over 32.
Pulse is 158.

542
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,250
We're already filling her
with fluids. Yeah.

543
00:29:17,019 --> 00:29:19,932
She was acidotic.
We pushed bicarb.

544
00:29:20,544 --> 00:29:21,844
They needed more hands.

545
00:29:21,975 --> 00:29:24,365
Keep her on 100% oxygen.
No, no, do not.

546
00:29:24,448 --> 00:29:25,875
Not until she is more stable.

547
00:29:25,958 --> 00:29:27,928
Cristina, scrub out,
go see if you can help. Go.

548
00:29:29,528 --> 00:29:32,545
There was so much swelling,
we couldn't find good veins.

549
00:29:32,628 --> 00:29:34,271
We had to start
a central line.

550
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,135
We can't use
the hyperbaric chamber

551
00:29:37,218 --> 00:29:40,637
- Until she's stable.
- Her c.K. Level's over 75,000.

552
00:29:40,724 --> 00:29:42,398
She's got fulminant rhabdo.

553
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:45,915
Everything was failing--
the--the kidneys, liver, lungs.

554
00:29:46,137 --> 00:29:47,903
Her chart was like
a phone book now.

555
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:52,684
- She's in s.V.T. Push 6 of adenosine.
- Systolic's in the 70s. Um, start her on dopamine--5 mics.

556
00:29:52,766 --> 00:29:54,298
She was coding
when I got there.

557
00:29:55,722 --> 00:29:56,696
What the hell?

558
00:29:57,309 --> 00:29:59,573
- She's in v-fib.
- Okay, starting manual ventilation.

559
00:30:03,012 --> 00:30:04,591
Charging to 200.

560
00:30:08,004 --> 00:30:08,747
Clear.

561
00:30:13,416 --> 00:30:14,145
300.

562
00:30:14,447 --> 00:30:15,208
Clear.

563
00:30:18,792 --> 00:30:20,211
No, there's blood. Wait!

564
00:30:20,489 --> 00:30:21,949
She started bleeding out.

565
00:30:22,074 --> 00:30:23,585
She's got blood
in her crike tube.

566
00:30:23,668 --> 00:30:25,019
She's got blood in the tube.

567
00:30:32,554 --> 00:30:33,505
Oh, my god.

568
00:30:41,383 --> 00:30:43,037
I know what happened.

569
00:30:44,952 --> 00:30:46,677
I know why she died.

570
00:30:49,936 --> 00:30:51,532
Get an amp
of bicarb in her!

571
00:30:51,624 --> 00:30:54,826
- Push one of epi.
- What about calcium? Did anyone try calcium?

572
00:30:54,908 --> 00:30:57,499
Get two more units
of p.R.B.C.S in here!

573
00:30:57,582 --> 00:31:00,155
- And bring some f.F.P.!
- Where is all this blood coming from?

574
00:31:00,266 --> 00:31:03,252
- D.I.C.--Her organs are shutting down.
- She's bleeding out. She is bleeding out.

575
00:31:03,336 --> 00:31:04,278
Just stop.

576
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,823
Stop. Everybody, stop!
It's over.

577
00:31:07,757 --> 00:31:09,010
You've lost her.

578
00:31:10,123 --> 00:31:11,382
Somebody call it.

579
00:31:16,952 --> 00:31:18,473
Well, whose patient is she?

580
00:31:22,106 --> 00:31:23,867
Whose patient is this?

581
00:31:41,004 --> 00:31:41,894
What?

582
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,636
I'm sorry.

583
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,531
I am so, so sorry.

584
00:31:46,879 --> 00:31:47,815
Dr. Kepner.

585
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:57,256
What did you tell them?
What did you say?

586
00:32:13,615 --> 00:32:14,777
I don't know you.

587
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:18,635
But dr. Adamson just spent
20 minutes in that chair

588
00:32:18,731 --> 00:32:20,778
Telling me what
an excellent doctor you are.

589
00:32:21,534 --> 00:32:22,917
Your school records,

590
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,704
Your evaluation from mercy west
all say the same thing.

591
00:32:26,731 --> 00:32:27,802
And I believe it.

592
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,069
I believe you're good.

593
00:32:31,152 --> 00:32:32,498
Dr. Webber,
I-I don't know--

594
00:32:32,581 --> 00:32:35,207
So you should be able to tell me
what would've caused

595
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:37,571
Cathy becker to bleed out
and die

596
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:39,588
From multisystem
organ failure.

597
00:32:41,568 --> 00:32:43,364
She had d.I.C.

598
00:32:44,597 --> 00:32:48,152
- Burns can cause massive tissue injury--
- But the burn was properly cleaned and dressed.

599
00:32:48,235 --> 00:32:50,801
There must have been more damage.
I mean, she had a collapsed lung.

600
00:32:51,294 --> 00:32:52,554
<i>That's right.</i>

601
00:32:53,962 --> 00:32:55,234
She needed a chest tube.

602
00:32:57,627 --> 00:33:00,304
But why would her lungs
have failed?

603
00:33:01,452 --> 00:33:04,353
She... She went
into respiratory distress.

604
00:33:04,436 --> 00:33:05,653
They said they criked he

605
00:33:08,313 --> 00:33:09,795
I wasn't there
for any of this.

606
00:33:09,878 --> 00:33:12,315
And why would she need
a crike? Why not intubate?

607
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,257
- Her airway was too swollen. They couldn't get
- But what would cause that inflammation in her throat?

608
00:33:17,459 --> 00:33:20,205
Soot. Smoke inhalation.
But she didn't have--

609
00:33:20,288 --> 00:33:21,971
How did
mrs. Becker's throat look?

610
00:33:26,966 --> 00:33:28,506
No, she wasn't hoarse.

611
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:30,619
She  wasn't coughing.
How did it look, dr. Kepner?

612
00:33:30,702 --> 00:33:32,861
Her breath sounds were good.
her respiratory rate was

613
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:34,476
What I'm asking you...

614
00:33:36,423 --> 00:33:38,174
<i>What it looked like.</i>

615
00:33:50,321 --> 00:33:51,183
<i>Okay.</i>

616
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,639
Your lungs sound good,
and your vitals are great.

617
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:56,408
- Open up, please.
- Oh, my god.

618
00:34:13,663 --> 00:34:16,019
Okay. You look good.

619
00:34:16,102 --> 00:34:17,812
These burns on your chest
are pretty minor.

620
00:34:17,905 --> 00:34:19,856
<i>But the one on your calf
might be third-degree.</i>

621
00:34:20,999 --> 00:34:22,151
You never looked.

622
00:34:24,856 --> 00:34:26,328
You didn't look in her throat,

623
00:34:27,042 --> 00:34:29,541
Because if you had,
you would've seen soot.

624
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:32,381
And you uld've
intubated immediately.

625
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:35,003
And none of this
would've ever happened.

626
00:34:35,086 --> 00:34:37,230
- No, that's, it was. I got distracted.
- I know.

627
00:34:37,318 --> 00:34:38,915
- It was--it was insane.
- I know.

628
00:34:40,295 --> 00:34:42,010
It was a simple mistake.

629
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,235
In the circumstances
you were under, I know--

630
00:34:58,496 --> 00:34:59,689
I'm sorry, dr. Kepner.

631
00:34:59,772 --> 00:35:01,538
- No, I m--I missed one step.
- I know.

632
00:35:04,731 --> 00:35:06,163
And look what it's led to.

633
00:35:19,172 --> 00:35:23,206
- She's bleeding out. She is bleeding out.
- Just stop. Stop. Everybody, stop!

634
00:35:23,296 --> 00:35:25,002
It's over. You've lost her.

635
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,323
Whose patient is she?

636
00:35:33,717 --> 00:35:35,409
Whose patient is this?

637
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:42,652
Time of death is 12:45 a.M.

638
00:36:02,258 --> 00:36:03,269
You're fired.

639
00:36:53,693 --> 00:36:54,805
Oh, my god. Danny.

640
00:36:54,985 --> 00:36:56,040
Oh, god.

641
00:36:59,143 --> 00:37:00,187
You're okay.

642
00:37:01,659 --> 00:37:03,032
Oh. Where's your mommy, pal?

643
00:37:03,166 --> 00:37:04,563
Let's go find mommy, huh?

644
00:37:05,788 --> 00:37:07,404
<i>When we're
headed toward an outcome</i>

645
00:37:07,474 --> 00:37:08,949
<i>That's too horrible to face...</i>

646
00:37:12,776 --> 00:37:15,404
<i>That's when we go looking
for a second opinion.</i>

647
00:37:18,086 --> 00:37:20,051
It's not the doctors,
richard.

648
00:37:22,753 --> 00:37:24,164
They're all good doctors.

649
00:37:24,849 --> 00:37:25,961
I know that.

650
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:31,242
What do you think
this was for?

651
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:34,305
For jennings,
it was about legal.

652
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,016
But this was for me.

653
00:37:39,005 --> 00:37:41,863
I needed to know
who finally was responsible.

654
00:37:45,041 --> 00:37:46,777
At least I was able
to do that.

655
00:37:58,693 --> 00:37:59,871
Say it, derek.

656
00:38:00,437 --> 00:38:02,123
Maybe it's not one doctor.

657
00:38:03,898 --> 00:38:05,734
Maybe it's too many doctors...

658
00:38:06,606 --> 00:38:08,074
Who don't know each other

659
00:38:08,418 --> 00:38:10,207
And who don't trust
each other.

660
00:38:13,656 --> 00:38:15,088
When I got to that room...

661
00:38:16,187 --> 00:38:17,431
There was chaos.

662
00:38:19,155 --> 00:38:20,770
Because that's
the system now...

663
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:22,381
Chaos.

664
00:38:24,248 --> 00:38:25,510
That has been the system

665
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:28,807
That has been in place
since this merger...

666
00:38:30,342 --> 00:38:31,484
Your system.

667
00:38:36,235 --> 00:38:38,476
I'm saying you should look again
at who's responsible.

668
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:48,070
<i>And sometimes...</i>

669
00:38:54,742 --> 00:38:57,389
<i>The answer we get
just confirms our worst fears.</i>

670
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:08,444
<i>But sometimes...</i>

671
00:39:12,894 --> 00:39:15,210
<i>It can shed new light
on the problem...</i>

672
00:39:19,467 --> 00:39:21,565
<i>Make you see it
in a whole new way.</i>

673
00:39:31,262 --> 00:39:33,492
Hey, is she gone?
Did she leave?

674
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,567
You know what?
She was good.

675
00:39:37,651 --> 00:39:40,186
She was a better doctor
than I am.

676
00:39:42,008 --> 00:39:44,197
Just...
Please shut up.

677
00:39:47,048 --> 00:39:48,704
You talk to April?

678
00:39:48,978 --> 00:39:49,793
No.

679
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,759
- What?
- Just waiting to see if you're gonna try to hit me again.

680
00:39:58,371 --> 00:40:00,197
I'm sorry. I was just, uh--

681
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,403
Forget it.
Rough night, right?

682
00:40:04,136 --> 00:40:06,231
So April missed
an airway ?

683
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:08,739
- That's so stupid.
- Airway first.

684
00:40:08,822 --> 00:40:10,793
It's, like,
med school 101, right?

685
00:40:10,876 --> 00:40:11,919
It's pretty basic.

686
00:40:12,002 --> 00:40:13,629
(reed) it was one second.

687
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:16,752
She got distracted
and she made a mistake.

688
00:40:16,835 --> 00:40:19,604
- That we all nearly got fired for.
- Nosedive's got a point.

689
00:40:19,735 --> 00:40:22,628
- Thank you. What?
- We nearly got fired for trying to fix

690
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,413
What she screwed up
in the first place.

691
00:40:24,496 --> 00:40:25,957
Yeah, because that's
our job.

692
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,355
What, you didn't make
any mistakes today?

693
00:40:30,558 --> 00:40:32,826
You've been distracted
for the entire week.

694
00:40:32,915 --> 00:40:36,183
And who knows what you screwed
up? But our patients didn't die,

695
00:40:36,254 --> 00:40:37,851
And that's why
we didn't get caught.

696
00:40:37,934 --> 00:40:39,592
It could've happened
to any one of us.

697
00:40:40,369 --> 00:40:42,592
<i>After all the opinions
have been heard...</i>

698
00:40:43,937 --> 00:40:47,821
<i>- And every point of view has been considered...
- Here she comes-.</i>

699
00:40:55,074 --> 00:40:56,465
<i>You finally find...</i>

700
00:40:58,329 --> 00:40:59,559
<i>What you were after...</i>

701
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,051
<i>The truth.</i>

702
00:41:20,612 --> 00:41:22,319
<i>But the truth
isn't where it ends.</i>

703
00:41:24,282 --> 00:41:25,142
Thank god.

704
00:41:25,225 --> 00:41:26,776
I was beginning
to think you went home

705
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:28,330
And left me here to rot.

706
00:41:31,246 --> 00:41:32,114
Go home.

707
00:41:32,454 --> 00:41:33,323
That's it?

708
00:41:34,926 --> 00:41:35,847
Ready to go?

709
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,791
Very. I've been waiting
for bailey all night.

710
00:41:43,524 --> 00:41:45,286
<i>That's just
where you begin again...</i>

711
00:41:48,181 --> 00:41:49,205
You okay?

712
00:41:49,427 --> 00:41:50,186
Yeah.

713
00:41:52,179 --> 00:41:53,447
Let's go home.

714
00:42:02,449 --> 00:42:03,632
What happened today?

715
00:42:05,257 --> 00:42:07,182
<i>With a whole new set
of questions.</i>
