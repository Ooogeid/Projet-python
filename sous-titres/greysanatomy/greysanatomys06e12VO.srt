1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,150
<i>Number one rule of surgery</i>

2
00:00:05,834 --> 00:00:07,174
<i>is limit exposure.</i>

3
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:08,299
Good.

4
00:00:08,571 --> 00:00:10,171
<i>Keep your hands clean,</i>

5
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:12,470
<i>your incisions small</i>

6
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:14,180
<i>and your wounds covered.</i>

7
00:00:15,438 --> 00:00:18,809
I've removed the tumor
and placed the catheters.

8
00:00:18,982 --> 00:00:22,104
Now I'm going to flood
the abdomen with heated chemo.

9
00:00:22,712 --> 00:00:25,441
It allows a greater
concentration of drug

10
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:28,152
to be delivered directly
to the affected area.

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,522
And the heat helps target
the cancer cells

12
00:00:30,647 --> 00:00:33,154
while leaving the normal cells
virtually unaffected.

13
00:00:33,279 --> 00:00:34,495
Start perfusion.

14
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,450
We'll place him in Trendelenburg.

15
00:00:39,068 --> 00:00:40,957
Then reverse Trendelenburg

16
00:00:41,317 --> 00:00:43,000
as we agitate the abdomen

17
00:00:43,563 --> 00:00:45,544
to make sure that the chemo

18
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,339
really washes everywhere.

19
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,676
She saw me.
Now I can go.

20
00:00:51,979 --> 00:00:55,054
- She's just getting started.
- I have a headache. I need coffee.

21
00:00:57,452 --> 00:01:00,346
I have a cure for a headache
that doesn't involve coffee.

22
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,644
I'm leaving.
There's a seat right there.

23
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:08,769
Thanks.

24
00:01:17,104 --> 00:01:19,203
I've never seen
a hot chemo lavage before.

25
00:01:20,052 --> 00:01:22,661
- It's fascinating.
- I thought you were leaving.

26
00:01:22,786 --> 00:01:25,522
The Chief asked me
to finish out my contract, which

27
00:01:26,076 --> 00:01:27,542
has a few more weeks.

28
00:01:27,667 --> 00:01:29,213
<i>Number two rule of surgery...</i>

29
00:01:30,042 --> 00:01:32,592
Is when rule number one
stops working...

30
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:35,469
<i>Try something else...</i>
- What I said, I didn't mean.

31
00:01:37,482 --> 00:01:41,182
You mean offering to trade Owen
like a horse or a baseball card

32
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:44,812
or a stale peanut butter sandwich
from your lunch box.

33
00:01:49,486 --> 00:01:51,586
- It was thoughtless...
- Fine.

34
00:01:52,728 --> 00:01:53,738
Fine.

35
00:01:54,182 --> 00:01:56,032
Let's just forget about it.

36
00:01:56,974 --> 00:01:59,418
<i>Because sometimes
you can't limit exposure.</i>

37
00:02:00,683 --> 00:02:02,683
<i>Sometimes the injury is so bad</i>

38
00:02:03,618 --> 00:02:05,118
<i>that you have to cut</i>

39
00:02:05,296 --> 00:02:06,396
<i>and cut big.</i>

40
00:02:07,435 --> 00:02:09,378
- If you report him...
- He's an alcoholic!

41
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,810
If you report him,
it'll be the end of his career.

42
00:02:11,935 --> 00:02:13,496
You don't give people any room.

43
00:02:13,621 --> 00:02:16,093
- Flaws are unacceptable to McDreamy.
- Don't "McDreamy" me.

44
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,553
McDreamy is being McAss.

45
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,889
He is an alcoholic.
How long has he been drinking?

46
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:22,132
- Since the holidays?
- You want to take notes?

47
00:02:22,257 --> 00:02:25,277
So you can show it to the board so
they can offer you his job on the spot?

48
00:02:25,402 --> 00:02:27,356
You want his job.
You know it and I know it.

49
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:30,304
I'm the head of neurosurgery.
I've a responsibility to this hospital.

50
00:02:30,429 --> 00:02:33,039
- Admit you want to be Chief.
- I'm done having this argument.

51
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,696
I'm going to the board.
I'm reporting Richard.

52
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,170
Post-it.

53
00:02:38,757 --> 00:02:41,091
- You can't call post-it.
- I am calling post-it

54
00:02:41,216 --> 00:02:44,371
because I told my secret about
my friend to my husband...

55
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,083
Not the head of neurosurgery,
my husband...

56
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:51,255
Which I have to be able to do.
So the laws of post-it clearly prevail.

57
00:02:51,389 --> 00:02:52,797
- This is wrong.
- Post-it.

58
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:54,765
- The Chief...
- Post-it.

59
00:02:57,917 --> 00:02:59,220
Fine. I won't tell.

60
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,750
Fine.

61
00:03:04,256 --> 00:03:06,185
Damn it.
You just make me want to...

62
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:20,699
Izzie's coming home.

63
00:03:21,422 --> 00:03:22,922
I have to tell Alex.

64
00:03:24,732 --> 00:03:26,432
I won't go to the board.

65
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:29,258
I won't say a word.

66
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:32,378
Just think about what I said.

67
00:03:33,618 --> 00:03:34,618
Okay.

68
00:03:39,612 --> 00:03:41,403
Izzie's... Coming...

69
00:03:41,528 --> 00:03:43,328
- Izzie's coming?
- Home.

70
00:03:43,453 --> 00:03:44,453
Crap.

71
00:03:45,117 --> 00:03:46,994
Izzie leaves, and Mark gets a kid,

72
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:49,080
and you two decide that
the best way to deal

73
00:03:49,205 --> 00:03:51,315
is to get drunk
and mash your genitals together?

74
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,108
No freakin' way you get to judge us
or give relationship advice.

75
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:56,915
Besides, you were a total
dirty mistress, like two weeks ago.

76
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,699
Are we calling me a dirty mistress?

77
00:03:58,824 --> 00:04:01,574
That was two years ago,
and his wife didn't have cancer.

78
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:04,577
Because I've only been with, like,
six guys in my whole life.

79
00:04:04,904 --> 00:04:07,728
Alex and I... We've done it before.
That was recycling.

80
00:04:07,853 --> 00:04:09,707
It was, like,
good for the environment.

81
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:11,912
Izzie's gone, I was horny,
she was there.

82
00:04:12,037 --> 00:04:13,627
Crap. I am a dirty mistress.

83
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,336
God. You're gonna tell Derek,
and then Derek's gonna tell Mark

84
00:04:16,461 --> 00:04:18,671
- that I'm a whore.
- I am not going to tell Derek,

85
00:04:18,796 --> 00:04:21,093
and neither are you,
you're not gonna say anything.

86
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,077
We are keeping our mouths shut.

87
00:04:24,411 --> 00:04:27,016
Izzie is coming home.
No one needs to know.

88
00:04:30,325 --> 00:04:31,441
Know what?

89
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:37,067
S06E12: <i>I like you so much better
when you're naked</i>

90
00:04:38,397 --> 00:04:41,343
There were no sterile
supplies in the OR last night.

91
00:04:41,468 --> 00:04:43,562
Surgery came to a complete stop
for a full hour.

92
00:04:43,687 --> 00:04:45,784
Central supply and maintenance
are understaffed,

93
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,925
and the autoclaves have been
breaking down. Now anything else?

94
00:04:56,584 --> 00:04:58,923
- I want to help.
- I don't need your help.

95
00:04:59,578 --> 00:05:01,455
The sterilizers are up
and running, so...

96
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,930
Not the hospital.

97
00:05:03,767 --> 00:05:04,767
You.

98
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:07,656
You stopped operating.

99
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,435
You're not teaching anybody
but Meredith.

100
00:05:12,067 --> 00:05:13,517
I'm wondering if...

101
00:05:16,621 --> 00:05:18,221
If you need some help.

102
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,920
No shame in asking.
You know that.

103
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,703
You can help...

104
00:05:30,808 --> 00:05:32,373
By doing your own job

105
00:05:33,872 --> 00:05:35,522
and letting me do mine.

106
00:05:37,611 --> 00:05:38,811
Anything else?

107
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:42,342
I'm done.

108
00:05:49,095 --> 00:05:51,016
So I went to the trailer.

109
00:05:51,468 --> 00:05:53,768
I don't live in the trailer anymore.

110
00:05:58,985 --> 00:05:59,985
So...

111
00:06:01,126 --> 00:06:03,508
Meredith called me and told me
you might be moving on.

112
00:06:05,463 --> 00:06:06,490
Just wait.

113
00:06:06,798 --> 00:06:07,948
I realize now

114
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,619
that I was wrong to blame you
for getting fired.

115
00:06:11,809 --> 00:06:15,249
- I'm sorry. It wasn't your fault.
- I don't want to have some big talk.

116
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:16,709
I gotta go to work.

117
00:06:20,491 --> 00:06:23,886
I have a pet-scan later, so maybe
I'll see you at the hospital?

118
00:06:24,011 --> 00:06:25,259
Is everything okay?

119
00:06:25,857 --> 00:06:28,721
I found some residencies
with open spots and applied.

120
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,181
They all just want to
make sure I'm stable.

121
00:06:33,521 --> 00:06:35,060
One of them is close.

122
00:06:35,421 --> 00:06:36,971
It's in Tacoma, so...

123
00:06:37,718 --> 00:06:38,868
We'd be okay.

124
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:41,509
I could commute from here and...

125
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,331
I know that you don't want
to have some big talk, but

126
00:06:44,456 --> 00:06:46,280
Seriously I have
to get to the hospital.

127
00:06:46,645 --> 00:06:50,325
The place really sucks these days. You'd
be happy you don't work there anymore.

128
00:06:53,341 --> 00:06:54,891
- Sorry.
- Don't be.

129
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:58,083
I am happy. I'm gonna work in Tacoma,
and it's gonna be awesome.

130
00:06:58,208 --> 00:06:59,908
You're gonna be jealous.

131
00:07:05,329 --> 00:07:06,925
- You're operating?
- I am.

132
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,762
- A whipple. That's big.
- I say, go big...

133
00:07:11,406 --> 00:07:12,456
Or go home.

134
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:17,837
Excuse me, sir?

135
00:07:17,962 --> 00:07:20,428
- You're taking dr. Bailey's whipple?
- Is that a problem?

136
00:07:20,553 --> 00:07:22,941
Not at all.
I'm the resident on the case.

137
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:25,526
I'm thrilled to be assisting you.

138
00:07:25,651 --> 00:07:27,196
I will be assisting you, right?

139
00:07:27,564 --> 00:07:29,948
You can open.
That way, dr. Grey will be fresh

140
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:33,866
when she dissects the neck
of the pancreas from the portal vein.

141
00:07:33,991 --> 00:07:36,970
- That's the hardest part.
- That's a fifth-year procedure.

142
00:07:37,242 --> 00:07:40,334
It's what we've been practicing.
And I'm telling you, you're ready.

143
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:43,462
But if you don't think
you're ready...

144
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,180
I'm ready. I'm ready.

145
00:07:48,683 --> 00:07:51,733
- What's going on?
- Hunt's got an MVC in here.

146
00:07:53,292 --> 00:07:54,973
- Use a hand?
- What?

147
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,183
Can I help?

148
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:59,651
You know what you can do first?
You can make that stop.

149
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,819
Dude! Stop singing!

150
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,950
I'm trying to get you people
to understand

151
00:08:09,075 --> 00:08:12,032
the seriousness of the problem.
I've lost my upper register completely.

152
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,494
Dr. Karev, this is Mr. Mafrici,
your consult.

153
00:08:15,924 --> 00:08:17,621
I just need some antibiotics.

154
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:21,710
I open in "Tosca" in a week,
and he gave me bronchitis.

155
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,935
- I did not give this to you.
- Take a deep breath.

156
00:08:25,612 --> 00:08:28,950
He teaches piano to children.
I can hear them hacking away

157
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:32,010
during their lessons, and then he comes
in the house and touches things.

158
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,180
Stop talking.

159
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:35,811
He's got decreased breath sounds.
He's gonna need an x-ray.

160
00:08:35,936 --> 00:08:39,059
- Can you take him up?
- Page an intern. I don't have time.

161
00:08:41,786 --> 00:08:44,536
Hunt took him up,
said thanks for your help.

162
00:08:46,298 --> 00:08:47,648
You got time now?

163
00:09:03,408 --> 00:09:05,358
- You're hot.
- You're hot, too.

164
00:09:06,278 --> 00:09:07,978
No, you're... "hot" hot.

165
00:09:08,768 --> 00:09:10,663
Okay. Thanks.

166
00:09:11,453 --> 00:09:12,644
You have a fever.

167
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:14,344
You have a fever.

168
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,221
- What is that?
- What?

169
00:09:16,558 --> 00:09:18,117
- Oh, my God.
- What?

170
00:09:18,242 --> 00:09:20,292
Pox. Pox.
You have chickenpox.

171
00:09:28,187 --> 00:09:29,776
Turns out she loves Owen

172
00:09:30,184 --> 00:09:33,450
and thought she came here to be all,
"Teddy and Owen," but there's me,

173
00:09:33,575 --> 00:09:35,670
and now she's all pain
and threatening to leave,

174
00:09:35,795 --> 00:09:38,301
- so I told her she could have him.
- What?

175
00:09:38,504 --> 00:09:41,310
She's an amazing teacher, and
I'm happy again,

176
00:09:41,435 --> 00:09:43,916
I'm in the OR and I'm feeling
like myself and...

177
00:09:44,397 --> 00:09:47,081
And, of course, I didn't mean it.
I love Owen.

178
00:09:47,206 --> 00:09:49,892
I love him. But that means that
I don't get to have her, so...

179
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:52,708
Maybe I meant it?

180
00:09:54,601 --> 00:09:57,137
Here's the thing...
You can't talk like this.

181
00:09:57,913 --> 00:09:59,534
It's, like, I get you...

182
00:09:59,659 --> 00:10:02,303
But other people don't,
so you can't talk like this.

183
00:10:03,435 --> 00:10:06,767
It's crazy. It's, like, if you tell
someone their baby is ugly.

184
00:10:07,061 --> 00:10:10,776
They know it, you know it, everybody
knows it, but you don't talk about it.

185
00:10:11,538 --> 00:10:13,944
But you're saying surgery, right?

186
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:16,365
Gun to your head, you would
choose surgery over Derek?

187
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:19,910
I am saying don't talk about this.
And don't talk about it to Owen.

188
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,116
That's the world-class specialist
you wanted me to see?

189
00:10:29,241 --> 00:10:31,171
Little Grey has had
the chickenpox vaccine.

190
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:34,383
I snooped through your personnel file.
I on the other hand, have not

191
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,350
nor did I ever have them as a child.

192
00:10:36,475 --> 00:10:39,332
- You're a pediatrician. How have...
- I am a pediatric surgeon.

193
00:10:39,457 --> 00:10:41,427
I don't do little diseases
on little people.

194
00:10:41,552 --> 00:10:43,308
I do big surgeries on little people.

195
00:10:44,204 --> 00:10:45,978
This is ridiculous.
I'm going home.

196
00:10:47,554 --> 00:10:50,857
You're not going anywhere.
You're highly contagious right now.

197
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:54,087
You leave this room, and you're gonna
touch doorknobs and elevator buttons,

198
00:10:54,212 --> 00:10:56,280
and then you'll be
the outbreak monkey.

199
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:59,199
- I'm going to kill you.
- I love you.

200
00:10:59,548 --> 00:11:03,537
Stop scratching, cause you're just gonna
make it worse, then you're gonna scar.

201
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,292
I gotta get my hands
on a body again, Mer.

202
00:11:09,346 --> 00:11:12,413
I think I'm gonna get an offer
from Oregon, but I can't take it.

203
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:15,424
It's too far. I can't do that
to Alex. I gotta get this Tacoma thing.

204
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:19,511
You know what would help? A call from
Derek Shepherd, head of neurosurgery.

205
00:11:22,135 --> 00:11:23,235
Talk to him.

206
00:11:23,539 --> 00:11:26,064
- Talk to me about what?
- She's up a for a job in Tacoma,

207
00:11:26,189 --> 00:11:27,807
and she wants you to call.

208
00:11:27,932 --> 00:11:30,196
- It isn't even ranked in the top 20.
- But it close,

209
00:11:30,321 --> 00:11:33,392
- and she can repair things with Alex.
- Fine. Have her give me the number.

210
00:11:33,517 --> 00:11:34,743
I read the board.

211
00:11:34,868 --> 00:11:37,237
The Chief is doing a whipple,
and you're scrubbing in.

212
00:11:39,371 --> 00:11:42,409
- You can stop worrying. He's fine.
- He hasn't operated in months,

213
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:45,366
and his first surgery back
is a 7-hour procedure

214
00:11:45,832 --> 00:11:47,782
with a 20% complication rate.

215
00:11:49,882 --> 00:11:52,046
First you were worried
that he wasn't operating.

216
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:55,721
- Now you're pissed that he is.
- I don't trust him anymore.

217
00:11:57,648 --> 00:11:58,648
Post-it.

218
00:12:10,128 --> 00:12:12,075
He's fine. He's fine.

219
00:12:13,568 --> 00:12:16,443
I thought it was infection.
Like pneumonia?

220
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:19,037
- That's one of the possibilities.
- What are the others?

221
00:12:19,162 --> 00:12:21,312
The fluid could also indicate...

222
00:12:21,768 --> 00:12:24,409
Karev made the diagnosis.
Let him talk.

223
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:29,039
Heart failure and cancer
could also cause

224
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:31,041
- this much fluid to occur.
- Cancer?

225
00:12:32,131 --> 00:12:33,919
Would you have to remove my lung?

226
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,797
- He said cancer is only a possibility.
- I sing.

227
00:12:37,353 --> 00:12:38,927
It's my entire life.

228
00:12:39,656 --> 00:12:41,009
... Besides me.

229
00:12:41,347 --> 00:12:42,969
What you meant to say was that

230
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,806
singing was your entire life
besides me.

231
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:52,458
You heard the Chief
is operating today?

232
00:12:54,113 --> 00:12:55,363
Took my whipple

233
00:12:55,758 --> 00:12:57,984
and is having Meredith Grey

234
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,028
do the pancreatic dissection...

235
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:04,032
A procedure that I performed
for the first time just last year.

236
00:13:05,467 --> 00:13:07,117
The Chief's judgment...

237
00:13:10,772 --> 00:13:13,487
Is not clear and rational.

238
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,837
There's nothing I can do.

239
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,713
You're the only one who can.

240
00:13:22,196 --> 00:13:23,246
I performed

241
00:13:23,685 --> 00:13:27,672
intraperitoneal hyperthermic
chemo this morning,

242
00:13:28,363 --> 00:13:31,768
and I kept looking up into the gallery
to see if the Chief was there.

243
00:13:33,227 --> 00:13:35,077
That was a big deal for me.

244
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,696
Anyway, he wasn't there.

245
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:41,063
And I don't know
why I thought he would show,

246
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:43,363
because the truth is...

247
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:47,392
He's gone.

248
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,796
And he's been gone a long time.

249
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:12,875
Arizona thought some work might take
your mind off your itching.

250
00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:15,809
Scratching will take
my mind off of itching.

251
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:17,898
Take off my gauze paws.

252
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,626
She said that you'd say that,
and that I should say no.

253
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:24,727
So how about we start with the tibial
plateau fracture, room 22-40?

254
00:14:27,572 --> 00:14:29,284
I'm an attending.
You're a resident.

255
00:14:29,705 --> 00:14:32,855
As your superior, I'm ordering
you to take them off.

256
00:14:33,227 --> 00:14:36,384
She said that you would say that, too.
Technically, I'm on her service today,

257
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:38,309
so she's my boss, not you.

258
00:14:38,434 --> 00:14:41,463
We have the lisfranc fracture,
room 22-11.

259
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,326
Please let me scratch,

260
00:14:43,451 --> 00:14:45,598
- just for five minutes,
- No. It'll scar.

261
00:14:45,723 --> 00:14:47,964
I don't care. Scars are hot.

262
00:14:48,089 --> 00:14:50,722
Scars are badass.
Scars are poetic.

263
00:14:51,827 --> 00:14:53,475
I'm begging you, little Grey.

264
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:56,311
- Please don't call me little Grey.
- I'm in pain...

265
00:14:56,784 --> 00:14:58,941
"down to the core of my being" pain,

266
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:02,971
"I'm going crazy" pain,
"scary, will this ever go away" pain.

267
00:15:03,096 --> 00:15:06,983
Do you get that? Do you know what I...
Do you know what I mean when I say that?

268
00:15:07,108 --> 00:15:10,287
Because this pain is
"need to scratch an itch

269
00:15:10,412 --> 00:15:11,785
I can't scratch,"

270
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:15,053
"the pain of a thousand itches,"
and it's making me crazy.

271
00:15:15,178 --> 00:15:17,295
Not "funny" crazy.
This is "bad" crazy, okay?

272
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,598
It's "dark" crazy.

273
00:15:18,723 --> 00:15:22,087
It's "make a suit out of someone else's
skin" crazy. Pain, little Grey. Pain.

274
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:24,172
I had sex with Alex.

275
00:15:24,692 --> 00:15:27,050
I had sex with Alex, which I regret,

276
00:15:27,477 --> 00:15:31,054
Completely, because I am in love
with Mark. I didn't think.

277
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:33,691
But I'm scare that I can't handle
the daughter and the baby

278
00:15:33,816 --> 00:15:37,602
- the "Mark's gonna be a grandpa" thing.
- Why are you telling me this?

279
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,896
I am in pain, too,
is what I am saying.

280
00:15:40,297 --> 00:15:42,023
I get your pain.
Don't you see that?

281
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,370
I do feel your pain
because I am in pain, too.

282
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:49,598
I have pox between my butt cheeks.

283
00:15:49,723 --> 00:15:52,409
Your "pain" does not begin
to compare to mine.

284
00:15:52,847 --> 00:15:53,869
Get out.

285
00:15:54,383 --> 00:15:56,633
Just out!
Out! Out! Out! Out! Out!

286
00:15:57,371 --> 00:15:59,682
- What are you talking about?
- She's on this thing...

287
00:15:59,807 --> 00:16:01,954
If you had to choose between
the thing you love...

288
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,594
Surgery... and the person you love
which would you choose?

289
00:16:04,719 --> 00:16:07,757
You would choose Izzie? Cause you two
are gonna get back together.

290
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,269
Why do you have to choose?

291
00:16:09,394 --> 00:16:11,803
Doesn't matter you just do.
Which one? Surgery or love?

292
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,687
- I want both.
- That's what I said.

293
00:16:13,812 --> 00:16:15,700
- You can't have both.
- Why the hell not?

294
00:16:15,825 --> 00:16:18,098
- Why the hell is he here?
I said he could be in here

295
00:16:18,223 --> 00:16:21,023
- cause he's in the whipple, too.
- Whatever. Once again,

296
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:24,398
- you can't have both you've to choose.
- Choose what?

297
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:33,074
My petscan got pushed back an hour,

298
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:36,202
so thought I'd...
Join you for lunch.

299
00:16:37,321 --> 00:16:38,496
Okay. That.

300
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:42,061
You have to give up that...
Learning the procedure,

301
00:16:42,263 --> 00:16:44,660
tuning out the world until you get it,
like, you know,

302
00:16:44,785 --> 00:16:46,963
doing the procedure is
the only thing that matters,

303
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,070
like if you don't get to do it,
you'll die.

304
00:16:49,195 --> 00:16:51,467
- That's what you have to give up.
- For what?

305
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,722
- Love.
- Why?

306
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:55,879
- That's what I said.
- That's not the point.

307
00:16:56,004 --> 00:16:58,725
You know you couldn't do it.
You know you'd choose the procedure.

308
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:01,603
Fine! If I had to choose, gun to
my head, I would choose surgery.

309
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,021
Thank you.

310
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:06,316
Is that so hard to say? I don't know,
why is it so bad to say that out loud?

311
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:07,934
Because it's crazy.

312
00:17:09,448 --> 00:17:10,737
How? It's crazy.

313
00:17:11,265 --> 00:17:13,115
Surgery... it's just a job.

314
00:17:13,663 --> 00:17:15,996
It's just a job. It's the thing
you come home from,

315
00:17:16,121 --> 00:17:18,796
not the thing you come home to.
And if you lose your job,

316
00:17:18,921 --> 00:17:22,696
you get another one,
cause there's always another one. But

317
00:17:23,372 --> 00:17:25,072
If you lose your love...

318
00:17:25,985 --> 00:17:28,213
If you think
you're losing your love...

319
00:17:29,251 --> 00:17:31,601
Then suddenly, nothing else matters.

320
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:37,209
This is what you guys
talk about during lunch?

321
00:17:37,604 --> 00:17:41,267
I'm with them.
Love comes and goes.

322
00:17:42,638 --> 00:17:43,938
Surgery doesn't.

323
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,085
Results are back.

324
00:17:57,717 --> 00:17:58,952
You choose love.

325
00:17:59,472 --> 00:18:02,576
Just did a perfect dissection
without lacerating the portal vein.

326
00:18:02,701 --> 00:18:05,801
You gonna do that little
fist pump in surgery, too?

327
00:18:08,345 --> 00:18:10,827
The tests showed a malignancy
on your left lung.

328
00:18:10,952 --> 00:18:12,563
It's called pleural mesothelioma.

329
00:18:12,688 --> 00:18:15,218
And it's a cancer that surrounds
the lining of your lung.

330
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:17,887
- So what, you... You cut out his lung?
- Best-case scenario,

331
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,890
we won't have to remove any lung
tissue except for the tumor.

332
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,643
- Did you hear that? That's good.
- I'm not deaf.

333
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,158
What's the worst-case scenario?

334
00:18:26,283 --> 00:18:29,733
We get in there, and the damage is too
extensive, and we have to remove more.

335
00:18:30,091 --> 00:18:32,643
- My whole lung?
- That's the worst-case scenario.

336
00:18:32,768 --> 00:18:35,363
But, yes, it is a possibility.

337
00:18:35,703 --> 00:18:38,212
But it's also possible they
won't have to remove any.

338
00:18:38,337 --> 00:18:40,660
- So let's stay positive.
- Will you please shut up?

339
00:18:41,098 --> 00:18:43,371
I can't take
your cheerful little voice

340
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,875
shoving positive thinking down my throat
when my life is basically over.

341
00:18:47,302 --> 00:18:49,377
People do recover
from things like this.

342
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,713
- And then they go on to...
- What?

343
00:18:52,111 --> 00:18:54,081
- Go on to what?
- Live.

344
00:18:54,206 --> 00:18:55,467
I won't have a lung.

345
00:18:55,873 --> 00:18:59,125
I'm a singer.
So you see my problem?

346
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:01,304
You can direct.
You can teach.

347
00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:02,429
Like you?

348
00:19:02,805 --> 00:19:05,043
I'd rather die than spend
two hours every day

349
00:19:05,168 --> 00:19:08,883
listening to mediocre
music majors doing their scales.

350
00:19:09,008 --> 00:19:11,065
I know that this is
a lot to take in,

351
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,561
and if you need time to talk
or get a second opinion...

352
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:15,070
I want my lung.

353
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,558
Dr. Altman...

354
00:19:21,635 --> 00:19:22,635
I'm big...

355
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,520
Too big.

356
00:19:24,939 --> 00:19:26,599
I don't fit in airplane seats,

357
00:19:26,724 --> 00:19:30,728
and as Jeff is telling me, my feelings
don't always fit the situation.

358
00:19:31,478 --> 00:19:33,588
If my food is overcooked
in a restaurant,

359
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:35,465
I get enraged.

360
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,272
I want to kill the waiter.

361
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:39,761
But I don't.

362
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,057
I politely ask him
to take my meal back

363
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:44,346
and bring it to me
the way I asked for it.

364
00:19:45,005 --> 00:19:48,271
I spend my days
making myself smaller,

365
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,633
more acceptable.

366
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:52,557
And that's okay,

367
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,776
because at night when I go on stage,

368
00:19:55,499 --> 00:19:57,904
I get to experience the world
the way I feel it...

369
00:19:58,925 --> 00:20:00,679
With indescribable rage

370
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,953
and unbearable sadness

371
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:05,428
and huge passion.

372
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:09,042
At night, on stage,

373
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:11,876
I get to kill the waiter
and dance on his grave.

374
00:20:13,357 --> 00:20:15,107
And if I can't do that...

375
00:20:16,801 --> 00:20:18,301
If I all I have left

376
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:20,826
is a life
of making myself smaller...

377
00:20:22,061 --> 00:20:23,861
Then I don't want to live.

378
00:20:25,566 --> 00:20:26,566
I don't.

379
00:20:28,312 --> 00:20:29,561
And believe me, honey,

380
00:20:30,266 --> 00:20:31,966
you don't nt me to live.

381
00:20:53,037 --> 00:20:55,237
Are you stealing sterile supplies?

382
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,606
I need sterile instruments.

383
00:20:58,731 --> 00:21:01,306
I'm not gonna get caught
with my pants down cause

384
00:21:01,431 --> 00:21:03,981
- this hospital can't get...
- I get it.

385
00:21:07,225 --> 00:21:08,975
I want to do something...

386
00:21:09,257 --> 00:21:10,457
Something I...

387
00:21:11,266 --> 00:21:12,316
Think is...

388
00:21:14,904 --> 00:21:16,482
I have a responsibility.

389
00:21:17,379 --> 00:21:18,529
But I just...

390
00:21:19,163 --> 00:21:20,528
So what's stopping you?

391
00:21:22,529 --> 00:21:24,685
The other half
of the twisted sisters.

392
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:28,100
Is that what you call Meredith
and Cristina... The twisted sisters?

393
00:21:30,147 --> 00:21:31,164
That fits.

394
00:21:35,182 --> 00:21:36,182
So this...

395
00:21:37,594 --> 00:21:38,630
This thing...

396
00:21:41,929 --> 00:21:44,179
I could come out of it looking,...

397
00:21:45,257 --> 00:21:46,262
Pretty bad...

398
00:21:47,336 --> 00:21:50,536
Like I did it for the wrong reasons,
like I did it...

399
00:21:50,777 --> 00:21:51,827
For myself.

400
00:21:56,681 --> 00:21:58,674
In my experience,
nobody goes into a battle

401
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,727
cause they want to win
a purple heart.

402
00:22:00,921 --> 00:22:03,404
You do the right thing,
and sometimes that gets you a medal,

403
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:06,033
and sometimes it gets you killed.

404
00:22:06,917 --> 00:22:08,701
How do you know
it's the right thing?

405
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,669
When it's the best thing
for the most people,

406
00:22:11,983 --> 00:22:15,140
the thing that...
Keeps the most people alive.

407
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:22,874
How you doing?

408
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,750
A little claustrophobic.

409
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:27,136
Focus on your breathing.
That always helps.

410
00:22:34,022 --> 00:22:35,572
Alex, I have to know.

411
00:22:36,442 --> 00:22:39,842
When Mer called, she said
you were moving on. Have you...

412
00:22:39,967 --> 00:22:40,967
Moved on?

413
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,864
I slept with someone.

414
00:22:49,491 --> 00:22:50,491
Damn it.

415
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,780
We'll get through it.

416
00:22:59,967 --> 00:23:02,271
- Are you still there?
- I'm right here.

417
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:05,432
Can you hold my hand or something
so I know you haven't left?

418
00:23:05,557 --> 00:23:06,926
I can't reach your hand.

419
00:23:10,063 --> 00:23:11,613
I can hold your foot.

420
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:14,434
Foot is good.

421
00:23:27,152 --> 00:23:30,752
Look, Derek, I'm busy.
I have a surgery in less than an hour.

422
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,529
You want me to drink that?

423
00:24:13,158 --> 00:24:14,808
But I believe you will.

424
00:24:14,933 --> 00:24:17,483
I'm gonna go,
and you're gonna drink it.

425
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:19,791
You're gonna try not to,
but in the end...

426
00:24:21,048 --> 00:24:22,348
You'll drink it.

427
00:24:26,664 --> 00:24:30,514
I also believe that this won't be
the first drink you drank today.

428
00:24:50,191 --> 00:24:53,041
This tumor is huge.
I've never seen pleura this thick.

429
00:24:53,166 --> 00:24:54,738
It's like a watermelon rind.

430
00:24:54,863 --> 00:24:57,379
Damn it. I'm gonna have to get rid
of the lung, the diaphragm

431
00:24:57,504 --> 00:24:59,497
and the pericardium with this tumor.

432
00:25:01,179 --> 00:25:02,625
That's what I need to do.

433
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:05,628
That's what's advisable
for optimal survival.

434
00:25:09,152 --> 00:25:12,820
But that's not what we're gonna do.
We are going to remove the visible tumor

435
00:25:13,255 --> 00:25:15,223
and we are going
to treat the lung with

436
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:17,346
with intrapleural
hyperthermic chemotherapy.

437
00:25:17,471 --> 00:25:20,041
Karev, find out what Bailey used
in the procedure this morning,

438
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:23,473
and gather everything that I need. Yang,
you're gonna help me remove this tumor.

439
00:25:23,598 --> 00:25:26,524
This morning, Bailey said the hot chemo
lavage was only indicated

440
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:27,902
in abdominal surgery.

441
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:30,657
Sugarman at the Brigham has been
researching its applications

442
00:25:30,782 --> 00:25:34,574
as it applies the pleural mesothelioma.
And he's a singer...

443
00:25:35,296 --> 00:25:36,896
And he needs his lung.

444
00:25:46,143 --> 00:25:47,493
You look like hell.

445
00:25:48,385 --> 00:25:49,435
Chickenpox.

446
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,299
Stay back.
I'm contagious.

447
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,134
I had 'em when I was 6.

448
00:26:02,546 --> 00:26:03,696
How was L.A.?

449
00:26:04,764 --> 00:26:07,176
Addison nicked
one of the uterine arteries.

450
00:26:07,301 --> 00:26:08,858
But she was able to fix it.

451
00:26:10,344 --> 00:26:13,369
Sloan's okay,
and the baby's gonna be okay, too.

452
00:26:13,494 --> 00:26:14,494
Good.

453
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:18,784
I slept with Addison.

454
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:21,932
I gotta tell Lexie?

455
00:26:23,236 --> 00:26:25,152
It's Lexie. She's so good.

456
00:26:25,277 --> 00:26:27,376
- How do you lie to a girl like that?
- Lie.

457
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,044
- Really?
- Really.

458
00:26:32,503 --> 00:26:33,633
I hurt.

459
00:26:34,868 --> 00:26:35,868
Here.

460
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:38,729
I got you covered, kid.

461
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,430
What are you doing?

462
00:26:42,191 --> 00:26:43,841
I'm gonna help you.

463
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,526
That's amazing.

464
00:26:52,651 --> 00:26:54,320
- No scar.
- Keep going.

465
00:26:54,807 --> 00:26:57,956
Thank you. Thank you,
thank you, thank you,

466
00:26:58,081 --> 00:26:59,508
You saved the lung,

467
00:27:00,392 --> 00:27:02,642
the whole lung?

468
00:27:04,861 --> 00:27:05,861
Now what?

469
00:27:05,986 --> 00:27:07,792
Now the work really begins.

470
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,310
This is gonna be a long recovery,
but he should be fine.

471
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:16,080
Does it make me awful to say
that I'm just slightly disappointed?

472
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:19,178
I guess I was
sitting out here thinking,

473
00:27:19,303 --> 00:27:21,334
now he's gonna be
like the rest of us, who

474
00:27:21,459 --> 00:27:23,173
teach and direct

475
00:27:23,607 --> 00:27:26,357
and do all the things
he finds so demeaning.

476
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,706
You know what's demeaning?

477
00:27:29,984 --> 00:27:31,983
Loving a man, taking care of him,

478
00:27:32,397 --> 00:27:34,615
doing his shopping,
making his meals,

479
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,826
making sure
his humidifiers are clean,

480
00:27:36,951 --> 00:27:39,801
cause God forbid
his humidifiers aren't clean.

481
00:27:41,084 --> 00:27:44,016
What's demeaning...
Is loving a man

482
00:27:45,393 --> 00:27:47,293
who thinks so little of you.

483
00:27:52,094 --> 00:27:55,298
He's got an army of nurses, so if
you want to walk out of here, you can.

484
00:27:55,693 --> 00:27:58,093
We'll take care of him.
You could go.

485
00:28:02,512 --> 00:28:03,556
I love him.

486
00:28:07,863 --> 00:28:09,520
You should hear him sing.

487
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,314
Nobody sings that well.

488
00:28:12,284 --> 00:28:13,284
He does.

489
00:28:19,793 --> 00:28:22,491
See that stitch there? You just made
the dude diabetic for life.

490
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:25,911
Shut up. I'm trying to concentrate
until the Chief gets here.

491
00:28:28,897 --> 00:28:30,624
Dr. Webber apologizes.

492
00:28:30,861 --> 00:28:34,796
He got caught up in some sort
of administrative something.

493
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:36,926
So let's dig in.
Patient ready?

494
00:28:37,051 --> 00:28:39,222
We are all prepped and ready.
Just waiting on you.

495
00:28:39,347 --> 00:28:42,261
- Dr. Grey, care to open?
- Actually, I was gonna open.

496
00:28:42,676 --> 00:28:43,726
Okay, sure.

497
00:28:44,282 --> 00:28:47,615
Dr. Webber was going to let me do
the pancreatic neck dissection,

498
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:51,240
- so I've prepped.
- I don't believe you're ready for that.

499
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:54,367
I'll be doing it.
You're welcome to observe.

500
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:57,151
Go ahead.

501
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:59,050
10-blade.

502
00:29:03,745 --> 00:29:06,033
I'm sorry you didn't get
a chance to do the procedure.

503
00:29:06,158 --> 00:29:09,194
- Something came up. It happens.
- I'm not surprised about Richard.

504
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:11,653
You're not a dumb person, but,
you're acting like one.

505
00:29:11,778 --> 00:29:13,778
I am not going to turn him in.

506
00:29:14,593 --> 00:29:15,961
Tacoma passed on Izzie.

507
00:29:17,114 --> 00:29:20,181
I did my best. Just too much history,
too many red flags.

508
00:29:21,725 --> 00:29:23,804
If I went to the board,
they'd make me Chief.

509
00:29:24,344 --> 00:29:26,347
The first thing I'd do
is hire Stevens back.

510
00:29:29,744 --> 00:29:31,944
It's your choice.
It's up to you.

511
00:29:46,043 --> 00:29:47,410
That should be me.

512
00:29:47,796 --> 00:29:51,096
Don't be jealous.
They're just friends... Best friends.

513
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:56,060
I had the chickenpox,

514
00:29:56,185 --> 00:29:58,385
and I told her I hadn't because...

515
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,260
I find her miraculous...

516
00:30:03,074 --> 00:30:04,774
Breathtakingly stunning.

517
00:30:06,208 --> 00:30:07,208
Just...

518
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:09,849
I can't stop looking at her.

519
00:30:10,327 --> 00:30:13,802
And I was afraid, with the ooze
and the fevers and the

520
00:30:14,368 --> 00:30:15,518
scratching...

521
00:30:15,643 --> 00:30:18,502
I wanted to stay
in the sexy part of things. So,

522
00:30:18,627 --> 00:30:21,077
So I lied to my girlfriend,
and now...

523
00:30:24,383 --> 00:30:26,383
He makes scratching look sexy.

524
00:30:28,541 --> 00:30:30,541
He makes everything look sexy.

525
00:30:38,842 --> 00:30:40,004
So you get it.

526
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,411
You didn't have to do that,
but you did.

527
00:30:42,536 --> 00:30:44,467
- You get it.
- What are you talking about?

528
00:30:44,635 --> 00:30:46,535
I choose surgery over a guy.

529
00:30:47,358 --> 00:30:49,555
I'm not gonna apologize
for it, especially to you.

530
00:30:49,813 --> 00:30:51,470
You didn't have to save his lung.

531
00:30:51,595 --> 00:30:54,399
The right thing would've been
to remove it. But the patient was clear

532
00:30:54,524 --> 00:30:56,610
that he didn't want to live
without his gift,

533
00:30:56,735 --> 00:30:58,085
and you get that.

534
00:30:59,046 --> 00:31:00,396
I choose my gift.

535
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:04,659
I want to be great,
and I want to learn from you.

536
00:31:05,545 --> 00:31:06,895
I choose my gift.

537
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,269
- How'd your surgery go?
- Great.

538
00:31:16,394 --> 00:31:19,407
See? And you were all worried.
You're a rock star. Speaking of which,

539
00:31:19,532 --> 00:31:21,629
Do you know if Derek
has talked to Tacoma yet?

540
00:31:22,622 --> 00:31:23,756
No, I don't.

541
00:31:24,615 --> 00:31:27,259
Good. Cause I just got my scans back,
and they're really good.

542
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,657
And so it would be great
if he could mention

543
00:31:29,782 --> 00:31:33,057
that I am officially not dying
of cancer when he talks to them.

544
00:31:33,318 --> 00:31:35,024
I'm gonna get this job, Mer.

545
00:31:35,149 --> 00:31:37,313
I'm gonna get this job
and I'm gonna get Alex back

546
00:31:37,438 --> 00:31:39,470
and I'm gonna be myself again.
I can feel it.

547
00:31:39,765 --> 00:31:42,673
I'm gonna go get Derek and show him
my scans before he calls Tacoma.

548
00:31:44,465 --> 00:31:46,265
I'll go tell him... Derek.

549
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:47,738
And you go tell Alex.

550
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:49,281
Okay.

551
00:31:58,243 --> 00:32:00,563
Okay, fine.
You can go to the board.

552
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,060
Just...

553
00:32:14,009 --> 00:32:17,359
Sorry. Car crash came in.
I got here as soon as I could.

554
00:32:17,484 --> 00:32:20,134
That's okay.
It gave me time to get drunk.

555
00:32:20,259 --> 00:32:21,909
So what's the occasion?

556
00:32:22,034 --> 00:32:24,576
I thought Beth was an idiot.
If we're being honest here...

557
00:32:24,701 --> 00:32:26,059
I didn't know that we are.

558
00:32:26,184 --> 00:32:29,205
Maybe not an idiot,
but just not good enough for you.

559
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:30,858
So how long you been here?

560
00:32:30,983 --> 00:32:34,201
I'm sure that it
wasn't easy for her...

561
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,245
But do you know
what she said to me once?

562
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:39,531
She said that once you guys
were married, she was done.

563
00:32:39,656 --> 00:32:43,656
She was done teaching and she was
just gonna start making babies.

564
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,338
And I remember thinking to myself,

565
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:49,300
Does Owen know
you have, like, zero ambition?

566
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:53,429
And then there's Cristina,
who is exactly the opposite.

567
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:56,647
It would actually be funny
if it wasn't so just...

568
00:32:58,161 --> 00:32:59,161
Not funny.

569
00:33:01,341 --> 00:33:02,341
I get it.

570
00:33:02,466 --> 00:33:04,815
She... She is beautiful

571
00:33:05,374 --> 00:33:08,033
and talented and kind of amazing.
She's right. I get her.

572
00:33:08,158 --> 00:33:09,989
I'm calling you a cab.
Can I get a cab?

573
00:33:10,114 --> 00:33:13,895
- Come on. Let's get you home.
- But she was willing to trade you...

574
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,034
For me.

575
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:18,750
If I stayed,
she said I could have you.

576
00:33:32,738 --> 00:33:34,288
How was your surgery?

577
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,720
It was good.

578
00:33:35,845 --> 00:33:37,806
It was fine.
It was...

579
00:33:38,602 --> 00:33:40,126
Here. Want to see?

580
00:33:48,562 --> 00:33:49,608
I'm so...

581
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:50,878
I'm so glad.

582
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:53,464
I'm so glad.

583
00:33:55,132 --> 00:33:58,182
- It's like it never happened.
- Yeah, but it did.

584
00:33:58,534 --> 00:34:00,034
It all happened, Iz.

585
00:34:00,977 --> 00:34:03,042
You got cancer, and we got married,

586
00:34:03,633 --> 00:34:06,171
You died and you lived again...
And you...

587
00:34:06,296 --> 00:34:08,311
You left, then you came back.

588
00:34:08,436 --> 00:34:09,797
And we got through it.

589
00:34:11,366 --> 00:34:12,716
I got through it.

590
00:34:12,841 --> 00:34:14,641
And I'm on the other side.

591
00:34:16,455 --> 00:34:18,162
I love you so much,

592
00:34:18,713 --> 00:34:19,713
and I...

593
00:34:20,365 --> 00:34:21,615
Till I met you,

594
00:34:22,459 --> 00:34:25,109
I used to think
I just wasn't a good guy.

595
00:34:25,943 --> 00:34:28,145
Growing up with my family,

596
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:29,775
That's what they told me.

597
00:34:30,689 --> 00:34:31,689
But now...

598
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:35,447
After all of it,
I know that I'm a good man.

599
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,365
And I thank you for that,

600
00:34:38,919 --> 00:34:42,287
because I know now that I'm good enough
not to deserve this...

601
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,440
Not to have to feel like this...

602
00:34:48,978 --> 00:34:52,381
Not to love you so much
that I almost hate you.

603
00:34:54,781 --> 00:34:56,881
I deserve someone who will stay.

604
00:35:00,017 --> 00:35:01,617
I'm happy you're okay.

605
00:35:03,042 --> 00:35:04,768
And I'm happy about your job.

606
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:08,500
And I want you to go...

607
00:35:11,584 --> 00:35:14,528
And be happy and not come back.

608
00:35:54,581 --> 00:35:56,195
I'm sorry about the surgery.

609
00:35:57,338 --> 00:36:01,188
- I got caught up with paperwork...
- You don't have to apologize.

610
00:36:02,489 --> 00:36:05,089
You don't have to apologize
for anything.

611
00:36:09,579 --> 00:36:10,729
<i>In surgery...</i>

612
00:36:11,975 --> 00:36:14,525
<i>the healing process begins
with a cut...</i>

613
00:36:17,203 --> 00:36:18,403
<i>An incision...</i>

614
00:36:21,128 --> 00:36:22,678
<i>the tearing of flesh.</i>

615
00:36:26,218 --> 00:36:28,868
Where have you been?
You just disappeared.

616
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:33,156
I left you, like, ten messages.

617
00:36:33,648 --> 00:36:34,848
Are you drunk?

618
00:36:38,961 --> 00:36:40,611
Wait. What? What? What?

619
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:42,583
You make me sad.

620
00:36:44,065 --> 00:36:46,679
You think that surgery
is gonna make you feel.

621
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:50,249
You think that a successful career
is gonna make you happy.

622
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:52,512
You think you know things.
You know things,

623
00:36:52,637 --> 00:36:54,817
and nothing else matters,
no one else matters.

624
00:36:54,942 --> 00:36:56,792
People do matter. I matter.
We...

625
00:36:59,354 --> 00:37:00,354
We matter.

626
00:37:08,081 --> 00:37:10,281
So you don't get to toss me aside.

627
00:37:11,539 --> 00:37:12,646
I won't let you.

628
00:37:13,883 --> 00:37:16,333
<i>We have to damage
the healthy flesh...</i>

629
00:37:22,291 --> 00:37:24,408
<i>in order to expose the unhealthy.</i>

630
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:35,936
<i>It feels cruel...</i>

631
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,845
- ... How did, Sloan's surgery go?
- I slept with Addison.

632
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:48,599
Thank go

633
00:37:49,669 --> 00:37:52,419
Cause I slept with Alex.
Oh, I was feeling so...

634
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:56,528
You know how I was feeling...
Which is why this is great.

635
00:37:56,653 --> 00:37:58,569
You know, we're...
We're even.

636
00:37:58,694 --> 00:38:00,694
We kind of canceled each other out.

637
00:38:02,315 --> 00:38:03,865
You slept with Karev?

638
00:38:06,985 --> 00:38:09,536
While I was dealing with
my sick daughter?

639
00:38:10,197 --> 00:38:11,697
While I was hurting?

640
00:38:12,896 --> 00:38:16,418
You weren't hurting.
You were sleeping with Addison.

641
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:18,136
You broke up with me,

642
00:38:18,831 --> 00:38:19,880
left me...

643
00:38:21,352 --> 00:38:22,402
And just...

644
00:38:29,764 --> 00:38:32,014
I can't even look at you right now.

645
00:38:39,165 --> 00:38:41,973
Do you know what it took
for me to make this happen?

646
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:44,051
Please tell Derek I'm really sorry.

647
00:38:44,176 --> 00:38:47,366
This isn't about Derek.
It's about me. It's about us.

648
00:38:47,736 --> 00:38:49,916
You don't just walk away
from people.

649
00:38:50,041 --> 00:38:53,383
- You don't just throw people away.
- I can't, Meredith. Okay? I can't

650
00:38:53,508 --> 00:38:54,748
be here. Please.

651
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:56,500
Please try to understand.

652
00:38:57,029 --> 00:39:00,379
I have to start over.
I need to start over, okay?

653
00:39:16,081 --> 00:39:17,312
Please don't go.

654
00:39:20,223 --> 00:39:21,623
This is your home.

655
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,542
No, it's not,

656
00:39:24,747 --> 00:39:27,823
not anymore. It's just a place
I worked, and I can do that anywhere.

657
00:39:37,703 --> 00:39:38,853
<i>But it works.</i>

658
00:39:40,737 --> 00:39:42,237
<i>You risk exposure...</i>

659
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:47,020
What are you doing? You'll...
You'll get the chickenpox.

660
00:39:47,602 --> 00:39:50,604
So... I get the chickenpox.

661
00:39:50,953 --> 00:39:52,653
<i>For the sake of healing.</i>

662
00:39:57,685 --> 00:39:59,235
<i>And when it's over...</i>

663
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:03,525
<i>once the incision has been closed...</i>

664
00:40:06,932 --> 00:40:07,932
<i>you wait.</i>

665
00:40:08,149 --> 00:40:10,199
Did you see him before he left?

666
00:40:11,632 --> 00:40:13,535
I didn't think it'd make it easier.

667
00:40:15,736 --> 00:40:17,186
For him or for you?

668
00:40:18,676 --> 00:40:20,576
It's the best thing for him.

669
00:40:21,965 --> 00:40:23,165
You knew that.

670
00:40:25,021 --> 00:40:26,381
It was the only thing.

671
00:40:28,919 --> 00:40:31,419
Let's not pretend
you did this for him.

672
00:40:32,503 --> 00:40:34,653
It's just you and me here, Derek.

673
00:40:34,977 --> 00:40:36,527
You did this for you.

674
00:40:37,521 --> 00:40:40,236
In the choice
between surgery and love,

675
00:40:40,361 --> 00:40:41,761
you chose surgery.

676
00:40:42,897 --> 00:40:45,358
- You chose ambition today.
- So did you.

677
00:40:46,667 --> 00:40:49,029
You knew he wasn't ready to
go back into the OR

678
00:40:49,673 --> 00:40:51,656
But you wanted to do
that surgery so badly,

679
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,924
you were willing to overlook it.

680
00:40:56,951 --> 00:40:58,201
We're the same.

681
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,190
<i>You wait...</i>

682
00:41:02,653 --> 00:41:05,353
