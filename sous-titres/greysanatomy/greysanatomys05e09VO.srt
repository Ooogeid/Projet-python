1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,339
When you're little,
nighttime is scary

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,250
Because there are monsters
hiding right under the bed.

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:09,990
When you get older,

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,310
The monsters are different...

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,900
Self-doubt...

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,150
Loneliness...

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,720
Regret.

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,000
And though you may
be older and wiser,

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,480
You still find yourself
scared of the dark.

10
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,329
I'm crazy. That's what
this is--craziness.

11
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,689
You're not crazy. Then what is this?

12
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:37,609
What--what--what--
what are you?

13
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,970
I'm a dead man who loves
you. This is my imagination.

14
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,049
I've always had a very
active imagination.

15
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:43,979
Izzie, you touched me.

16
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,989
I touched you when you
were alive, and kissed you.

17
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,679
Everything that's
happening has haened.

18
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,930
I'm--i'm reliving moments.
This is just residual grief.

19
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,069
All right, so I guess
the only way to test it

20
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,029
Is to do something

21
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,410
We never got a chance
to do in real life.

22
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,320
Dr. Yang?

23
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,520
Dr. Hunt.

24
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,580
Are you here for me?

25
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:46,960
What?

26
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,140
I-i meant
my--my trauma.

27
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,059
I'm here for a possible appy.

28
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,740
The ambulance is on its way in.

29
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,800
Did you want to say something?

30
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,240
H-how'd you beat the ambulance?

31
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,030
I live across the street.

32
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,529
Your sofa sucks.

33
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,010
I can't sleep.

34
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,700
I never went to bed.

35
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,839
You usually read on
the bathroom floor?

36
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,430
I didn't want to wake derek.

37
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:33,679
These are my mother's journals

38
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,069
From when she was a resident.

39
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,809
I thought we hated your mother.
You know, I kinda think now,

40
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:40,039
If I wasn't her child,
I would've liked her.

41
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,439
I mean, she was funny and intense.

42
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,949
A lot like cristina. Oh, yeah.
"intense" I get from cristina.

43
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:46,979
"funny," not so much.

44
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,709
Oh, she takes a while to warm up,

45
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,399
But when she does, she's cristina.

46
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,609
Give her a chance. She's very loyal,

47
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,459
And we need allies around here.

48
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,119
What do you think about,
uh, what's her name,

49
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,249
Your sister lexie? What
do I think about her?

50
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:03,129
Yeah, as an ally for
me. My new intern b.F.F.

51
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:06,469
No, i--no, no, I don't--
I don't see that. I just--

52
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,519
She was raised right,
with parents and rules

53
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,910
And smiley-face posters
on her wall. Hmm.

54
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,489
It's cristina. There's an appy.

55
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:18,190
See? Loyalty.

56
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,569
I'll come with you.

57
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,159
Try to snag some time
in the skills lab.

58
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,450
I'll get dressed. Okay.

59
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:28,869
Hot.

60
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,010
Horny.

61
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,709
Oh, what--what are
you doing out here?

62
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,709
You think you're the only
one who paid off a nurse

63
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:39,070
To page you with an appy?
That's not what I meant.

64
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,829
Oh! That's what I meant.

65
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,929
If you're out here, then
who's in there with izzie?

66
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,020
Oh, my god! Derek?

67
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:48,839
Oh! What?

68
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,579
Oh. What? What's the matter?

69
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,050
Nothing. Nothing. I just, um...

70
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,590
What are you doing dressed? It's
3:00 in the morning. Oh, my god.

71
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,679
Oh! Who's making a porno
movie in izzie's room?

72
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,500
Oh, relax. She's
flying solo. That's hot.

73
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:06,659
Iz, the party's over.
We got an appy coming in.

74
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,970
Death, let's go.

75
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,489
She's living here, too, death?

76
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,539
Just for a couple of days,
until she gets her own place,

77
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,169
And then she's gone. More strays.

78
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,129
No more strays.

79
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,370
Hey, iz. Iz, come on.

80
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,950
Hey. Hi.

81
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,530
Um, so,

82
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,789
Yeah, I'm not--i'm not--
I'm not feeling that great.

83
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,919
I think I'm gonna
skip it. I don't know.

84
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,069
I think I have the flu, or maybe it's
food poisoning. I-- you're sweating.

85
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,689
Yeah. Yeah, I'm hot...
And, you know, cold.

86
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,680
Hot and cold. I have the chills.

87
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,279
Yeah, I think I'm just
gonna go back to bed.

88
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,199
It didn't sound like
you were sleeping.

89
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,609
You know, I could skip the appy
and help you out if you want.

90
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:45,500
No! Noi'm... I don't want
to get you sick, too, so...

91
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,139
What are you all doing here?

92
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,489
Oh, uh, he's mine. I met the ambulance.
And she's sharing him with me.

93
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:55,569
He's mine. I'm on call. Good morning,
dr. Bailey. You look nice today.

94
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:56,829
Brownnoser. I got here first.

95
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:00,249
And the chief said I'm the
one to watch. Oh, I get it.

96
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,639
It's solo surgery time,
and you all have heard,

97
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,629
The past two years, the chief
has assigned an appendectomy,

98
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:09,289
So you little mini surgeons
dragged your butts out of bed

99
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:11,579
To pick up some final
tips from the master.

100
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,859
Yeah, it's kinda cute. All right, I
can use two of you. But I'm on call.

101
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,719
I-i just filled meredith in
on the case. Jason kron, 47,

102
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,439
Tenderness over mcburney's point.

103
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,930
Huh. Karev, what do
you know about mr. Kron?

104
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,369
I know he's a lucky man
to have you as a surgeon.

105
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,459
Arthur soltanoff, 45, fell
from a second story window.

106
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,489
Stable vitals,

107
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,109
Multiple fractures and lacerations

108
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:32,249
With evidence of head
trauma. Trauma one.

109
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,369
Dr. Bailey, I'm gonna need one of
your residents. Me. Mine. I'm on call.

110
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,449
It's yours. Dr. Bailey, we have a
patient wi severe abdominal pain.

111
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:39,749
Can you spare a resident?

112
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,759
All right, grey and yang,
prep mr. Kron for surgery.

113
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,039
Karev, you never know.

114
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,569
Severe abdominal pain could
become an appendectomy.

115
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:49,289
Dr. Bailey, I'm here to
help in any way that I can.

116
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,160
If there's a patient
in pain, I'm there.

117
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,989
Can you feel that? Can you feel that?

118
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,170
There's no need for you to be
doing that. I can feel that.

119
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,079
Okay, the residents
are here, all of them.

120
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,880
They're in the hospital,
so whatever you're doing...

121
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,649
What are you doing?

122
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,029
We gave him an epidural.

123
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,399
And didn't call me? Lexie.

124
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,519
It just happened. You know what?
Epidurals don't just happen.

125
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,429
I'm staying at death's.

126
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,319
I could've been here in ten minutes.
You're staying at meredith's?

127
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,459
Lexie. What?

128
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,360
Oh, dude. He peed himself.

129
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,819
We forgot the catheter.
No, no catheters.

130
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,490
You want to pee yourself again? No.

131
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:27,859
It's okay. An epidural,
hmm? Wow. I'm impressed.

132
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,220
Death is so wrong about you.

133
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,180
Why? What did she say?

134
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,660
That you're a priss.

135
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,130
Too bad he's not pregnant.
We could do a c-section.

136
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,770
We could take out his
appendix. Or amputate his foot.

137
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,190
Seriously.

138
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,510
He doesn't need his appendix.

139
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,329
We could take out his appendix.
We'll find an empty o.R.

140
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,579
We'll be in and out in an hour.

141
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,019
I'm sitting right here.
Oh, you could watch.

142
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,259
We wouldn'even have to put you under.

143
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,659
You'd just stay on the
epidural. I'm off tomorrow.

144
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,820
I'd trade and take his
shift so he could recover.

145
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,869
But they're all here.

146
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,609
They're busy chasing solo surgeries.

147
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,329
It's a genius idea.
We would be rock stars.

148
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:09,909
No. I draw a line at
a tube in my penis.

149
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,130
Line drawn.

150
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,560
Fine.

151
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,350
Do me.

152
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,350
As long as I can do
one of you guys next.

153
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,180
Done.

154
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,560
Done.

155
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,359
What do we got?

156
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,529
Massive injuries. Shepherd
and hunt are working on him.

157
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,339
Guy was sleepwalking
and took a 2-story header

158
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,819
Through a plate glass window.

159
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,999
Night terrors. Can you imagine?

160
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,309
You wake up, you're
battered, you're bruised,

161
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,539
You don't know where
you are or how you

162
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,389
Got there. Yeah, that
sounds like my life-

163
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,989
Married, betrayed, gay, abandoned,

164
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,889
And then I woke up and
had no idea how I got here.

165
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,289
I just figure this is the bottom.

166
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,439
This is as bad as it gets.
It can only go up from here.

167
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,419
Left tib/fib. The rest of his trauma
series is clear. He needs a head c.T.

168
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:52,169
He's got free fluid in there. Oh,
god. No, ivy, get out of the way!

169
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,219
Dad. Ivy, the mountain
lion's right there.

170
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:56,059
Sir, you're in a hospital.
Ivy! Where's my daughter?

171
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,519
Dad, I'm right here! He's gonna
kill my daughter. He's still asleep.

172
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,279
Let me go. I've
gotta get my daughter.

173
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,969
Calm down. Mr. Soltanoff, calm down

174
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,750
Let go! She needme!

175
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,539
Okay, bailey's got
an appy in o.R. Two,

176
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,509
So this floor is out,

177
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:20,209
But outpatient surgery
is totally open.

178
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,439
Okay, let's go.

179
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,899
Looking for something? Hi, um, uh...

180
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,559
We were giving sadie the tour.

181
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,129
Uh, this is the o.R. Board. Yeah.

182
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,219
And--and--and
this is a patient.

183
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,890
Um, you're in good hands. Dr.
Grey is an excellent doctor.

184
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,570
What's next on the tour?

185
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,119
Back to skills lab?

186
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,260
Skills lab. Great idea.

187
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,480
Gotta stick with my allies.

188
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,090
Smiley-face posters.
That's all I'm saying.

189
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,569
Mrs. Hammer, what
seems to be the problem?

190
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:55,099
Uh, I have this pain in my stomach,

191
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,469
And I can't keep food down.

192
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,889
It just goes right through me.

193
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:00,189
Just tell him your theory,
lauren. She has a theory.

194
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:03,269
Okay, I'm right here. I can speak.
She thinks she has stomach cancer

195
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,879
Because the internet told her so.

196
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,279
Yeah, I'm not a hypochondriac, okay?

197
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,139
He's not inside my body. I
have a theory, too, by the way.

198
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,399
It's a crazy disease
called diarrhea. Seth.

199
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,349
Fine. Shutting up.
Let's--let's take a look.

200
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,400
Okay.

201
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,449
You're not tender over your appendix,

202
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,299
So we don't need to take that out.

203
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,759
Well, that's a good thing, right?

204
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,050
I mean, you look upset. Mm,
just disappointed... For you.

205
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,670
I'm gonna have to
collect a stool sample.

206
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:33,100
I can't believe this is happening.

207
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,879
It wasn't a great nose anyway.

208
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,999
Yes, it was. What--
it was a nice nose.

209
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,090
Relax. I was kidding.

210
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,739
It was a gorgeous nose... Ow.

211
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,739
And it will be again.

212
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,299
Two weeks from now,

213
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,569
You won't even be able to
tell anything happened. Really?

214
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:48,549
Mm, three weeks.
Four tops. I hate you.

215
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,729
You love me. Ow.

216
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,589
Little pinch. Ow, ow, ow.  Ow. Ow.

217
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,870
Oh, come on. That didn't hurt.

218
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,919
Yeah, well, maybe if I
was having a good year,

219
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,529
It would feel like
just a little pinch.

220
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:03,629
But it hurts, mark.
It hurts a lot. Ow.

221
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,000
You know what?

222
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,710
I was gonna do this with some local,

223
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,319
But I think we'll use
conscious sedation,

224
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,959
That way, when you wake
up, your nose will be fixed,

225
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,740
And it'll be a whole new day.

226
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,909
Okay, well, at least I'll
still have you, right?

227
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,379
You'll still be my friend

228
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,209
And have sex with me when I want?

229
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,480
Anytime.

230
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,380
You know, once your face heals.

231
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,649
I hate you.

232
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:28,780
You love me.

233
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:33,289
I hit a doctor? I-i
don't understand.

234
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:36,699
What am I even doing here? Your
daughter said you were having a bad dream

235
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:40,479
And jumped out of the window. Do
you have a history of sleepwalking?

236
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,799
It started a couple of
years ago when my wife died.

237
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,539
It scared me so much, I went
to one of those sleep clinics.

238
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:50,519
They said it was stress induced
and gave me some clonazepam.

239
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,129
How's that been working?

240
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:54,359
Well, I'm raising a 13 year old,

241
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,340
So stress comes with the job.

242
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,190
I haven't had an episode in a while.

243
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:01,320
I must have forgotten
to take my pill tonight.

244
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,090
Honey...

245
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,439
I am so sorry.

246
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,669
You must have been so scared.

247
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:11,460
I'm okay. I'm fine. I'm
just worried about you.

248
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,660
I'm sorry.

249
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,439
Dr. Sloan. Hi. Hello.

250
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,049
Do you know where they
keep the i.V. Kits in here?

251
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,799
And where the hell are
all the damn interns?

252
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:28,119
Um, the interns are interning.

253
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,969
Busily interning.
They're v-very busy.

254
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,819
Dr. Sloan. Little grey.

255
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,279
I needed some medical supplies.

256
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,469
Found the intern in
the supply closet.

257
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:40,749
Did not invite the intern
into the supply closet.

258
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,799
Go away now, grey.

259
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,880
Thank you.

260
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,319
Stop looking at me like that. I
didn't do anything. Don't do anything.

261
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:48,899
I didn't. Don't.

262
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,130
I didn't.

263
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:55,410
Dr. Bailey, do you have to
visualize the peritoneum?

264
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,549
Mm, depends.

265
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,170
I've seen so many,

266
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,279
I can usually just feel it.

267
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,719
Did you split the muscle
this way or that way?

268
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,579
This way. No,
wait. That--hold up.

269
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:08,299
That way. It's the kind of
thing that becomes so natural,

270
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,730
You don't even think
about it after a while.

271
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,869
Okay, the two of you
are thinking so hard,

272
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:18,190
You're making me tired
just looking at you.

273
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,419
This is so cool.

274
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,779
Cayou guys believe we're
actually doing this?

275
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,350
The epidural should be working.

276
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,030
Okay, she's numbed.

277
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,290
We're ready. Okay.

278
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,720
Here we go.

279
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,020
You okay?

280
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,299
I find the fact that you
have parents and rules

281
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,840
And smiley-face posters
oddly comforting.

282
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,050
What?

283
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:39,280
I'm ready.

284
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:43,470
Okay, surgical marker. I'm
going to mark the incision.

285
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,489
C-c-can you hold that
a little bit closer?

286
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:50,589
Okay, one-third of theistance

287
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:53,229
From the anterior
superior iliac spine

288
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,809
To the umbilicus.

289
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:55,940
Okay.

290
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,690
That's right about...

291
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,310
Okay.

292
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,020
It's a great day to
save lives, people.

293
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:14,339
Although, technically your
life is just fine and--

294
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,800
It's nighttime.

295
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,969
Oh, but shepherd always says
that and-- would you just go?

296
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,060
Scalpel.

297
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,749
This is a bad idea. This
is a really bad idea.

298
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,489
And--and it's the
middle of the night,

299
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:38,039
So our judgment is, you
know, it--it--it's off.

300
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,229
But we can use this frustration
that--that--that we're feeling,

301
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,719
Th-that's driven us to the point

302
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,049
Where we're about to
do a very stupid thing,

303
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:47,379
A thing that I am certain we'd
all regret, possibly from jail.

304
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,759
And--and we can use the
frustration for--for good.

305
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,879
We--we can ask for more
time in the skills lab,

306
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,939
And--and we can ask to
observe more surgeries,

307
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:57,170
And we can demand that our
residents teach us better.

308
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,430
Or you could just
take out my appendix.

309
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:15,059
Okay, I'm following
the taeniae coli down

310
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,879
To expose the appendix. Whoa.

311
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,729
There it is.

312
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:19,939
Look at that. I want to see.

313
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,130
Get her a mirror.

314
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,970
Ooh. Cool.

315
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,940
Huh. What?

316
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,440
Does it look a little
inflamed to you?

317
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:35,099
It does... A little.
It looks inflamed.

318
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,609
What? Can I see the book?

319
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,569
It's normally only supposed to be

320
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,889
7 to 8 millimeters in diameter.

321
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,949
Yeah. It looks a little big.

322
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:45,679
If it's inflamed, this
isn't routine procedure.

323
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,549
It's a... We should...
We should call a resident.

324
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,819
We're not calling a resident.

325
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,749
I'm sorry. I'm just...
I'm really freaking out.

326
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,559
Listen, I'm the one laying
open on the table here,

327
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,159
And e last thing I
need is you panicking.

328
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,400
If you can't handle it, leave.

329
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,530
Anybody else?

330
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,420
Kelly clamps and a 2-0 silk.

331
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,499
Your dad around? I need
to check his stitches.

332
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,139
He's still having tests.

333
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,400
I'll come back.

334
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,029
How's that doctor my dad hit?

335
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:28,009
She'll be okay. Tell
her I'm really sorry.

336
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,650
Why are you sorry?
You didn't hit her.

337
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:32,520
Yeah. It's just...

338
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:35,300
If I had been able to
get my dad back to bed...

339
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:38,120
Sometimes I can talk
him back to sleep.

340
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,509
But this hasn't happened
for a while, right,

341
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,050
Him sleepwalking?

342
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,220
Yeah. Right.

343
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,289
When's the last time you slept?

344
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:52,360
It's okay. I'm not that tired.

345
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,490
Seriously, kid. You
should get some rest.

346
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,370
So you diagnosed yourself?

347
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:06,629
I ordered antibiotics online to
kill a staph infection. Oh, my god!

348
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:09,139
That my husband
dismissed as a pimple.

349
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,569
Along with your dermatologist.

350
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,119
Who, like, barely looked at it, okay?

351
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,929
It was a staph infection,
seth. It was. And it went away.

352
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:19,229
After I took the drugs, it went away.

353
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,909
Pimples go away. Well,
now you have c-diff,

354
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,399
And it's not going away on its own.

355
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,549
Well, how do I treat it?
You've basically killed

356
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,989
All the healthy
bacteria in your body.

357
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:32,339
So now we have to introduce
new healthy bacteria. Okay.

358
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,489
By, uh, performing

359
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:37,150
What's called a...
A-a fecal transplant.

360
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,610
Poop?

361
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,849
I need a poop transplant?

362
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:42,879
Well, we'd feed a
small tube up your nose

363
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,730
And down into your stomach.

364
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,249
The, uh, donor needs to be

365
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:49,550
Someone who you share
everyday germs with,

366
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,890
Typically a spouse.

367
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,259
Admit it was a pimple.

368
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,889
Seth. No, I'm not going
to crap into a bowl

369
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:01,089
Until you admit it
was a pimple. Seth.

370
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:03,800
That's the deal. When you're
ready, come and find me.

371
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,079
Come on. Just tell
him it was a pimple.

372
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,980
It was not a pimple.

373
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:13,329
None of my interns are
answering their pages.

374
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:14,589
Did they go home or
did they just not--

375
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:17,059
Hey, you. Where are the other morons?

376
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,889
I don't know. I was
just getting candy.

377
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:22,620
And, um... I don't know.

378
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:23,939
Clearly.

379
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,940
I don't know. I don't know anything.

380
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,230
Give me your chocolate.

381
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,190
No, all of it. No, give me that, too.

382
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:42,650
Where are the stooges?

383
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,369
Well, that moron is a moron,

384
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:45,829
And the othemorons are a.W.O.L.

385
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,759
I need an intern to
page me if my guy agrees

386
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,769
To crap. I wonder if
they're in the skills lab

387
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:52,349
Sadie said something about skills
lab. Sadie's in the hospital?

388
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,619
All that time in the skills
lab is actually paying off.

389
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,779
My interns are still idiots,

390
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,160
But at least they're idiots
that can put in an i.V.

391
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,870
No, they're just idiots.

392
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,559
So... What's going on with izz?

393
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,210
I don't know what's wrong with izzie.

394
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,090
I'm sick of people not
talking to each other.

395
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,670
I'm gonna go get my
crap chick some crap.

396
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,480
Meredith.

397
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,330
Do you have a sec?

398
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,179
Tw what do you think you're doing?

399
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,839
Charting. I'm only charting.

400
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,380
Well... Where's--where's
3 and 4.2?

401
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,609
I-i don't know. I
thought they were--

402
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:38,089
You know what? Stop
talking. Come with me.

403
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,729
You're gonna do the
post-op orders on the appy,

404
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,719
And you're gna tell me
all about whatever trouble

405
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,440
You and your little friends are into.

406
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:49,380
Do you need a leash? Let's go.

407
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,900
No.

408
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,720
What do you mean, no?

409
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,810
I mean...

410
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:05,220
I k-kind of can't walk...

411
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,260
Due to the catheter and the epidural?

412
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:20,710
I can hear your heart beating...

413
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,579
Which is odd,

414
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,270
Because they took it
out for the autopsy.

415
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,640
This isn't real, is it?

416
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,750
This is real.

417
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,610
Izzie, this is real.

418
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,780
I'm just gonna keep my eyes closed

419
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:47,419
Because this is like
that moment in the morning

420
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,269
When you first wake up and
you're still half asleep

421
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:52,060
And everything seems...

422
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:55,469
Things are possible,
dreams feel true,

423
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:58,330
And for that one moment
between waking and sleeping,

424
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:01,000
Anything can be real.

425
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,490
And then you open your eyes,
and the sun hits you and...

426
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,660
And you realize that...

427
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,440
I'm just gonna keep my eyes closed.

428
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:20,770
Okay.

429
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,860
Okay.

430
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,240
I-i-i think
she's dying.

431
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,699
Her b.P. Is dangerously low. Get out.

432
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,309
We need to push 2 liters of
l.R. Should we call a code?

433
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,269
There is no code team
in outpatient surgery

434
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,589
In the middle of the
night because normally,

435
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:53,069
This procedure would
be done by a surgeon in

436
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,379
A regular o.R. Page the
chief and go get bailey

437
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,949
And tell her there's an emergency.

438
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:00,019
You're not to say anything
else, and take that crazy look

439
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,380
Off your face.

440
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,829
Hey, how's mr. Soltanoff?

441
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,689
I think his night terrors are
happening more than he knows.

442
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,280
The kid's exhausted.

443
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,279
It's gotta be scary,
going to bed at night,

444
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,119
Not knowing what you're gonna wake up

445
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,160
To. Sounds like living with meredith

446
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,030
She takes in strays.

447
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,070
It's your fault, you know.

448
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,169
I never thought about
little grey in that way

449
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:22,610
Until you told me not to.

450
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,489
Now I can't help it.
You planted a seed.

451
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:26,800
Unplant it.

452
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:30,820
She wants to tell you something.

453
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:38,839
I believe that you
believe it was a pimple.

454
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,789
Lauren.

455
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:41,650
That's the best I can do.

456
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:44,759
I believe that you
believe it was--

457
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,439
It was a pimple.

458
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,889
It was a staph infection.

459
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,399
No poo. No poo for you.

460
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,809
All right, wait, dude.
She could lie to you

461
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:55,899
And tell you what you want
to hear, but she's not.

462
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,689
She's telling you
what's real for her.

463
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,320
Stop walking away.

464
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,799
I still think this
could be stomach cancer.

465
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,960
And when I get a headache,
I think it's a brain tumor.

466
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:18,289
And I lay awake and
feel lumps in my breasts,

467
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:19,769
And then my heart starts to race

468
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:21,549
And I think I'm
having a heart attack.

469
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:25,800
So no, I don't think it was a pimple.

470
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,440
The world is a scary place...

471
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:33,179
And there are a thousand things a day

472
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,810
That can kill you.

473
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:38,770
And I don't see how you don't see it.

474
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,739
Dr. Bailey...

475
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,419
There's an emergency
in outpatient surgery.

476
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,389
What kind of emergency?

477
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:49,450
There's a... It's an emergency.

478
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,750
Please come.

479
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:56,459
I'd like to do an
e.E.G. There's a chance

480
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,809
That your night terrors are
caused by a kind of epilepsy

481
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,149
In the frontal lobe of your brain.

482
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,259
I-i went through all
that in the sleep clinic

483
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,739
Mm-hmm. As long
as I take my meds--

484
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,329
We have reason to
believe that the problem

485
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:08,459
May be a lot worse than you're
aware of. I don't understand.

486
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,599
Ivy, how often does
your dad sleepwalk?

487
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,630
I slp. I just forgot
my meds this time.

488
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,080
No, you didn't.

489
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:17,849
You took them while I
was brushing my teeth

490
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:20,249
Like you always do, and
then you put me to bed

491
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,750
Like you always do,

492
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,549
And then you woke up
screaming like you always do.

493
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:27,560
Ivy-- I try to
stay awake at night

494
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,950
Because usually I can
talk you back to bed.

495
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:33,640
But tonight, I must
have fallen asleep.

496
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:36,130
Honey, why didn't you tell me?

497
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,519
You said these bad dreams
were caused by stress,

498
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,599
And I'm your
stress. Sweetheart--

499
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,949
You take such good care
of me during the day,

500
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,239
I thought the least I could do

501
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,069
Was take care of you at night, dad.

502
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,699
But we're saying the nightmares
were caused by the epilepsy,

503
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,319
Not the stress.

504
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,169
And if the test
confirms the epilepsy,

505
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:53,940
You understand what that would mean?

506
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:57,280
This wasn't my fault?

507
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,090
That it wasn't your fault.

508
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,340
Dad...

509
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,540
Let's get the e.E.G.

510
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,920
Sweetheart.

511
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,070
Denny?

512
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,800
Denny?

513
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,400
Denny?

514
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,410
Denny?

515
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,509
Denny? God. Whoa, whoa.
What's all the yelling about?

516
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:30,109
You can't do that. You
can't just disappear.

517
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,589
I thought you were
gone. I was just--

518
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,430
I thought you had left me again.

519
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,829
Izzie, I told you, I'm here
for you. No, you're not.

520
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:40,819
You died. You died,
and you left me here.

521
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:44,879
I was left here by myself.
You left me... All alone.

522
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,019
You're not alone anymore.

523
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,059
Why? Why did you come back?

524
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,769
I had moved on. I-i got over you.

525
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:52,829
I have a life and a
job and a boyfriend,

526
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:55,759
And--and now you're back,
and I'm in this room all day,

527
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,460
Probably talking to myself.

528
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,709
I'm probably going crazy,

529
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,459
And there is a real world out there,

530
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,640
And I'm stuck in here with you.

531
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,239
I'm sorry I died.

532
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,489
No. No, screw you.

533
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:09,739
No, you don't get to
apologize for dying.

534
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:12,559
You don't get to apologize
because I killed you! Izzie--

535
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,199
I convinced you to
let me cut the l-vad,

536
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,609
And I killed you,

537
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:19,179
So you don't get to
apologize for dying. Izzie--

538
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,589
Dead people don't
apologize. Izzie--

539
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,110
No, just shut up.

540
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:24,870
Shut up.

541
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:48,700
I love you.

542
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:53,920
I love you, too.

543
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,809
What the hell is going on?

544
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:00,669
We were trying to
take out her appendix.

545
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:04,420
Well, whose foolish
idea was that? Mine.

546
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,289
Where are we?

547
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:07,979
We just found the artery
in the mesoappendix.

548
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,299
Apparently the stitches the interns

549
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,359
Did came off. Hand
me another 3-0 silk

550
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,929
Damn, I need some more suction.

551
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:15,239
How's her pressure
holding up? 74 systolic.

552
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,539
She is really bleeding.

553
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,549
I can't see anything. The
stump isn't closed right

554
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:21,829
She needs a partial cecectomy. I
can't get to the appendiceal artery.

555
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,680
Come on. Yes, you
can. You almost had it.

556
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,009
Is your visualization better?

557
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:30,139
No, I still-- i-i can't see
anything. Look, look, don't panic.

558
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,519
Here, put that down.

559
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,160
Feel down for the mesoappendix.

560
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,700
All right, find the pulsations.

561
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,210
Now follow it to the end.

562
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,739
It feels... Okay, I think I got it.

563
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,680
Good. Here, place your clamp.

564
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:48,279
Okay, yeah. That's right.

565
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,179
Okay, grey, you tie it off

566
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,199
While yang holds the clamp in place.

567
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,639
Stick tie or ligature suture?

568
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,859
Hey, hey, whatever works.

569
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,670
You'll have to do what
feels right to you.

570
00:26:58,290 --> 00:26:59,680
Ligature suture.

571
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,280
Are we gonna go to jail?

572
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,279
You're not gonna go to jail

573
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,410
'cause you didn't have the
balls to stay in the room.

574
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:16,610
The rest of us are gonna go to jail.

575
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:21,760
I just heard.

576
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,600
What the hell happened?

577
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:26,050
We live together. You
should've come to me.

578
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,879
So what, you... You
could've saved me?

579
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,229
No, but maybe I could've stopped you.

580
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:32,100
No, this isn't about you.

581
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,249
George, this is the one
thing that I have done

582
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,219
In the past femonths

583
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,050
That wasn't about
getting you to notice me.

584
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,199
I did this. You had
nothing to do with it.

585
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,550
This was all me.

586
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,480
Dude.

587
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,820
She's, like, in love with you.

588
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:50,870
How did you miss that?

589
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,410
It's 9-1-1.
I have to go.

590
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,100
Okay, so go.

591
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:21,650
Is this the part where...

592
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,609
You go back to heaven or wherever,

593
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:26,159
And you and your dead guy friends

594
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,339
Talk about how great it was

595
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,839
That you gave me this
last night together,

596
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,369
That i... Needed it
to grieve and ve on?

597
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:36,289
Me and my dead guy friends
mostly talk about sports.

598
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,389
Denny.

599
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:39,840
Izzie, go.

600
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,070
I'm not going anywhere.

601
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,510
We're just about ready.

602
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,499
I'm sorry, honey, for all my crazy.

603
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,559
Don't be sorry.

604
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,300
I love you, even crazy.

605
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,919
Okay, I've taken your
crap all these years.

606
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,890
It's finally time
for you to take mine.

607
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:06,869
I'm here for my wife,

608
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,539
But I think it's better for our
sex life if I don't see this,

609
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:12,050
So I'll be he for
her down in the lobby.

610
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,319
No more spikes. We've
eliminated the seizure area.

611
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,830
Now he can finally get
a dece night's sleep.

612
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,650
How did he not know
this was happening?

613
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:29,060
Wait, why is it his
fault for not noticing?

614
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,379
He's going through his
life thinking that they had

615
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,319
The kind of relationship
where she could talk to him,

616
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,880
If she was in trouble,
she would tell him.

617
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,779
If you really have
feelings for someone,

618
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:40,140
If you really love them,
then you talk to them, right?

619
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:41,820
Maybe she tried.

620
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:44,340
We don't know what
went on between them.

621
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:46,230
Maybe words failed her.

622
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:48,320
Sometimes...

623
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,570
Words fail.

624
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,369
Your dad won't be out of surgery

625
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:00,010
For at least another hour.

626
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,410
You could have a little nap.

627
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:04,959
What, you're 13,

628
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,380
You're hitting the hard stuff?

629
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,320
I like the taste.

630
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,309
I was raised by parents

631
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,500
Who weren't very
interested in having kids.

632
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:17,340
They had friends, they had lives.

633
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,870
They weren't around much at night.

634
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:24,330
And before I went to bed,
I'd turn on all the tvs...

635
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:27,610
Every light in the house,
even in the closets.

636
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:30,050
Still couldn't sleep.

637
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,799
It's hard to sleep

638
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,000
When you don't feel safe
in your own house, isn't it?

639
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:43,940
Give me that.

640
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,560
You are going to sleep.

641
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:47,719
No.

642
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,870
I'm not taking no for an answer.

643
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:52,430
Close your eyes. I'll be here.

644
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,750
Go on...

645
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,030
Close your eyes.

646
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,790
Close your eyes.

647
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,340
I was sleeping,

648
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,169
And sleep isn't easy
for me to come by.

649
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,869
But I was finally sleeping,
then I get a call--

650
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:17,559
I can't believe it. I
still can't believe it.

651
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,770
Don't beat yourself
up too much about it.

652
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,769
I've seen a lot of
maturity in the two of you

653
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:23,249
Through this whole mess.

654
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:26,409
You handled the crisis,
you handled the surgery,

655
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:28,090
You saved that girl's life.

656
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,240
And you called for help right away.

657
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,939
There was a time not so long ago

658
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:36,309
That you would've reached
a different conclusion.

659
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,609
You could've stuck to the
code and saved your own,

660
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:40,239
Tried to hide the whole mess.

661
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,319
You know, sometimes protecting
your colleagues is solidarity.

662
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,660
And sometimes it's just hubris.

663
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:49,769
I'm glad to see you know the
difference. Chief, you don't--

664
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:51,659
I-i can't let you two
get in trouble for this.

665
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:54,419
Lexie-- no, it's not right.
People tried to stop me.

666
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,199
Dr. Yang told me
yesterday to shut it down,

667
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,109
But I didn't listen. You
knew about this yesterday?

668
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,449
Sir, i--
did you know?

669
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:01,640
No.

670
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:04,659
You knew? You knew... No!

671
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,009
They were gonna cut her open? No!

672
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:08,119
Lexie just said you knew. Sutures.

673
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,899
I knew they were doing
sutures on themselves

674
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,459
And I didn't think I
needed to say anything

675
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:14,459
Because I had shut it down, I had
handled it. Apparently you didn't,

676
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,789
Because it almost cost lexie her job

677
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:17,509
Not to mention that sadie
almost died in there.

678
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:19,389
Okay, you know what?
Sadie did that to herself

679
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:20,189
And let's not pretend

680
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,839
That you have some sort
of relationship with lexie.

681
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,819
Let's not pretend that you care
about her. I care about my job,

682
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,469
And I care about
doing the right thing.

683
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:28,389
Who are you to lecture me
on doing the right thing

684
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:31,299
Are you kidding me? You're
not an attending, meredith.

685
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,249
You may be sleeping with one,

686
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,409
But you aren't one yet. Is
that what this is about--derek

687
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,209
It's always gonna be
about derek? Okay, fine,

688
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:37,759
It's not about derek.
It's about you and me

689
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,329
And the fact that you
didn't have my back in

690
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:41,499
That room. What would
you have wanted me to say

691
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,380
I don't know. Anything.
You should've said anything.

692
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,389
You have a relationship
with the chief.

693
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:47,249
You have his ear,

694
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:49,530
But you didn't say
anything to defend me.

695
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:52,440
Because this isn't just on me.

696
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,229
I mean, you just stood there,

697
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:56,889
And you watched him take me out
of the running for solo surgery.

698
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:58,229
You let me take all the blame,

699
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:01,269
But the fact is that we all
had interns in that room.

700
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,489
We all failed to supervise them.

701
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:05,559
And if your friend had died in there,

702
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,179
If you and I hadn't saved her life,

703
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,119
That would've been on all of us, too.

704
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,680
You should've said that.

705
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:27,120
Why are you looking at me?

706
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:28,949
We were just wondering...
The interns...

707
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:30,589
What you're going to say to them.

708
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:33,069
D--unh-unh. No,
no. I'm tired.

709
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:35,269
I'm not saying
anything to the interns.

710
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:37,569
I raised my babies.
You were my babies.

711
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:38,979
Now you all grown folks.

712
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,439
It's on you. You
raise your own babies.

713
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,909
So we have to talk to 'em?

714
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:46,130
Your babies. What do we say?

715
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:48,199
Do you really need a speech from me,

716
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,869
At this point, after all this time?

717
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:51,939
Because, I mean, if you do,
you shouldn't even be here.

718
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:54,279
If you do, then I
haven't raised you right,

719
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,949
And I know I raised you right.

720
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,280
No, you don't get a speech from me.

721
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:01,470
It's time for you to
make your own speeches.

722
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,940
Dr. Grey, present.

723
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,449
Sadie harris, 30,

724
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:20,339
Three hours status post-appendectomy

725
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,039
Complicated by severe hemorrhaging.

726
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,200
Death, what is this? Dr. Spalding.

727
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,719
Vitals stable, triple
antibiotic coverage.

728
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,270
She should fully
recover within two weeks.

729
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,019
And?

730
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:35,340
And... We, your surgeons...

731
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,869
Made mistakes that
compromised your care,

732
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:41,830
Mistakes that reflect
poorly on this hospital

733
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:43,760
And that won't happen again.

734
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,969
Effective immediately,

735
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:46,899
Every intern here is on probation.

736
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:50,330
So much as sneeze... And you're done.

737
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:52,889
None of you will see
the inside of an o.R.

738
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:54,159
Until further notice.

739
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,689
You've lost the chief's
respect, which, believe me,

740
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,789
Is not an easy thing to get back.

741
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:01,189
And speaking for myself,
you've lost my respect,

742
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:03,370
And you probably won't
ever get that back.

743
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:06,400
But he still respects izzie
stevens. What did you say?

744
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,839
You seem to still
respect izzie stevens,

745
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,410
And she killed a patient.

746
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,749
She was trying to save a man's life.

747
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:15,189
And you almost killed
a friend for fun.

748
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,370
It's different.

749
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:28,449
How you doing?

750
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:31,850
Oh... They give good drugs here.

751
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,079
Do I look bad?

752
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,589
Oh, you look beautiful.

753
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:37,979
Just badge of honor
all over your face.

754
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,790
I'm sorry.

755
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:45,789
Did I hear correctly,

756
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:49,329
That the, um, interns
went scalpel crazy?

757
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:51,310
Yes, you did.

758
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,600
Oh, crazy.

759
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:57,510
I don't know that
they were--crazy.

760
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,039
I can remember what it's
like-- being an intern,

761
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,679
Just loving medicine,

762
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,219
Being so excited by surgery,

763
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:09,140
Wanting to operate so badly
that I'd do anything...

764
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,719
That I couldn't stop bouncing
up and down long enough

765
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,540
To even hold a scalpel.

766
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:15,650
Now...

767
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:19,430
Now?

768
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:24,899
Girl, I can do most of my surgeries

769
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,730
Without even thinking about it.

770
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:28,599
It's like I'm driving.

771
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,109
You know, suddenly I'm at home,

772
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:32,040
I don't even know how I got there.

773
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:34,580
It's rote.

774
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:38,109
I don't even remember
most surgeries...

775
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:40,760
Most of the lives I save.

776
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:45,029
And the residents,
they're working so hard,

777
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:48,629
Just working like crazy
to get to do a solo surgery

778
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:51,089
That I have come to hate.

779
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:53,209
I hate appys.

780
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:55,159
Just--appys
bore me.

781
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,229
I resent the appendix
for bothering to get hot

782
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,650
And needing to come out.

783
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,750
I resent an organ. That's...

784
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:04,780
I don't know.

785
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,839
Maybe I don't want to do
general surgery after all.

786
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,349
Maybe I need a new challenge.

787
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:13,470
Maybe I need something to
make me bouncup and down.

788
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:16,720
Maybe I'm just tired.

789
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:19,560
It's okay...

790
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:22,090
To be tired.

791
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,260
Right?

792
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,210
You're tired, too?

793
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,120
I'm exhausted.

794
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,340
Deep-down-inside
exhausted.

795
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:38,300
I just--i
want...

796
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,470
I don't know.

797
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,460
But I want something.

798
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,700
Well, that makes two of us.

799
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:56,040
Sleep...

800
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,529
It's t easiest thing to do.

801
00:37:58,530 --> 00:37:59,860
You just...

802
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,870
Close your eyes.

803
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:12,869
Okay, fine. The
surgery was a bad idea.

804
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:15,449
No, it was a terrible idea.

805
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:16,779
And speaking as your boss,

806
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:19,179
It was an irresponsible
and reckless idea

807
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,599
That makes me seriously question

808
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,549
If you have what it takes
to be a good doctor. Death--

809
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:24,860
And as your friend...

810
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:29,390
What the hell is going on with you?

811
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,920
I don't know.

812
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:36,730
But for so many of us,

813
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:40,080
Sleep seems out of our grasp.

814
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:45,460
Thank you.

815
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,830
Your mom used to see how tired I was.

816
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,649
She used to make you bring me home

817
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:51,710
'cause I was all alone
and needed a family.

818
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,400
That was a good thing.

819
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,330
So either you bring
her home, or I will.

820
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:05,479
We want it,

821
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,890
But... We don't know how to get it.

822
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:19,250
I don't know why I came here.

823
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,649
Do you wt to come in?

824
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:29,510
No. No. I-i don't think
that'd be appropriate.

825
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:34,910
Well, do you want
to go someplace else?

826
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:38,760
No.

827
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,820
I think you're beautiful.

828
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,890
But once we face our demons...

829
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:08,080
Face our fears...

830
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:21,470
Lexie's here. Yeah.

831
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:24,100
Are you making up
a bed for her? Yeah.

832
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,980
You brought home a stray.

833
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:32,620
And turn to each other for help...

834
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,239
I'm gonna try to grab some sleep.

835
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,180
I gotta be back at the
hospital in six hours.

836
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,750
Okay. Okay.

837
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:41,870
No, alex, wait. Um...

838
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,130
I'm a mess.

839
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:47,219
I'm a flat-out, freaking
mess. I know that.

840
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,710
I know and...

841
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:52,309
I'm sorry. You deserve a lot better.

842
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:53,400
Stop.

843
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,439
Look, if you don't
want to be with me,

844
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,160
If this is too much
for you right now,

845
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,430
That's okay.

846
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,349
But you're gonna have
to break up with me,

847
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:05,010
'cause I'm not going anywhere.

848
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,900
I can handle the mess.

849
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:08,640
So it's up to you.

850
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:12,980
You coming?

851
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,100
I'm sorry.

852
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:29,890
I can't...

853
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,440
It's okay.

854
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,020
I'll be right here.

855
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,160
It's okay.

856
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,370
Nighttime isn't so scary because...

857
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:47,940
We realize we aren't
all alone in the dark.
