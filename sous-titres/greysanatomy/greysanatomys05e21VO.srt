00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:09,290
-chicken.
-Good chicken.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,300
Yeah,chicken.

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,200
I know it's chicken. I want
to know what it tastes like.

6
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:15,490
Tastes like chicken.

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,730
-I'm having surgery today.
-Maybe.

8
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,140
If the mets have shrunk.

9
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,160
I am maybe having surgery today,and as
such,I cannot taste the chicken for myself,

10
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,420
so i really need you guys to
tell me what it tastes like.

11
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,360
I need to nail down this dinner so I can announce
it on meredith and derek's wedding web site.

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,140
there's a web site?

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,530
So can you please be a little
more articulate than just chicken?

14
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:38,550
Oh,that's the one.

15
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:40,990
very dapper,Dr. Shepherd.

16
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,890
You're serious about this?
It's not some cruel joke?

17
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,140
you look fantastic.

18
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,620
Lheooks fantastic,right?

19
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,270
-yeah.
-Uh,whatever.

20
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:54,090
remember when we were little,and we would
accidentally bite a kid on the playground?

21
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,250
Good luck with your scan.

22
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,530
Good chicken.

23
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,680
So?

24
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,430
Pork.

25
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:03,630
Our teachers would go,"say you're sorry.

26
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,400
Fine. I'll taste the chicken.

27
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,190
And we would say it,but
we wouldn't mean it.

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,350
because the stupid kid we bit?

29
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:14,640
Totally deserved it.

30
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,040
Sorry. I'm sorry.

31
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,360
Take care now.

32
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,380
So... I can't afford rent.

33
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,420
Owen just told me to "take care now

34
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,720
nice.It's three words.

35
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,740
Yeah,it's more than she's
getting from any of her family.

36
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,450
My mom--silent.
My aunt--silent.

37
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:32,730
My ster aria-- I know. I know
how much power my father wields,

38
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:37,340
but seriously,I mean,what am
I,invisible,dead to them,to my mother?

39
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:38,950
Well,you just have to
give them some more time.

40
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,490
I mean,why can't you just
tell them you guys broke up?

41
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:43,890
It's no one's business who
you go out with anyway,right?

42
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,870
And I will leave you to ponder that.

43
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,800
But as we get older,making amends...

44
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,200
isn't so simple.

45
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,350
You really thinkI should lie?

46
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,850
I really think you should pay rent.

47
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,460
But,noou kw,whatever.

48
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,870
Take care now.

49
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:00,130
After the playground days are
over,you can't just say it.

50
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:00,930
You have to mean it.

51
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,130
I got you a present.

52
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,660
I told you,you can't give me money,even
if you are a fancy plastic surgeon.

53
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,030
I am not your charity case.

54
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,440
I-I am not your mistress. I'm
your friend,your equal,so...

55
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,420
it's not money.

56
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,260
Oh,really?

57
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:14,230
'Cause I was just doing the "poor but proud" thing
for show before I accepted your government cheese.

58
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,050
It's better than money. Wait.

59
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,740
of course,when you become a
doctor,"sorry" is not a happy word.

60
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,360
It either means,"you're
dying,and I can't help"...

61
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,910
She fell out of a tree
and broke all her limbs.

62
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,070
That is better.

63
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:33,340
Or it means,"this is really gonna hurt.

64
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,070
<font color=#38B0DE>greys.anatomy.
Season 5 Episode 21</font>

65
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,260
-How many days?
-29.

66
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,540
Fresh from rehab.

67
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:42,150
uh,I could tell you some
good meetings in the area.

68
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,080
Thanks. They--they
gave me a whole list.

69
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,730
So that's one more
thing we have in common.

70
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,570
have you...

71
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,470
talked to meredith...

72
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,550
to lexie?

73
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,280
Okay,willow,I'm afraid your
cheekbone looks broken,too.

74
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,100
I'll need to wait a few weeks until
the swelling goes down to repair that.

75
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,030
In a few weeks,I'm gonna
be up a tree in utah.

76
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:25,130
Those corporate bastards-- the same
ones who just bulldozed me out of kaili--

77
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:28,870
they want to clear-cut acres to
build another ski condo complex.

78
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,140
Sons of bitches!

79
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:33,620
There is so much about that
sentence I do not understand.

80
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,400
Uh,you were bulldozed out of something?

81
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,370
Uh,uh,kaili.

82
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,120
She was the tree that I was
living in for the past six weeks.

83
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:48,140
She was a beautiful 200-year-old oak in a
grove full of beautiful 200-year-old oaks.

84
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,530
You named a tree "kaili"?

85
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,950
Kaili is hawaiian for
"divine beauty and wisdom.

86
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,140
" And she was all of those things.

87
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:00,810
She was all of those
things,and now she's gone.

88
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,030
They're all gone. And
for what,yuppie housing?

89
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,710
Those corporate bastards!

90
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:11,320
I'm really sorr but you're not gonna be
climbing up any trees for a good long while.

91
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,430
How does one exactly live in a tree?

92
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,040
I mean,how exactly does
one say,eliminate waste?

93
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:19,530
He's,um,asking where your poo goes,

94
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:24,000
which may not be the most sensitive
questionwhile she's mourning the death of her...

95
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,320
tree friend.

96
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,560
Excuse me,doctor.

97
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,490
Oh,excuse
me,young-and-yummy doctor.

98
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,650
-Can I help you?
-I don't know.Can you?

99
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:46,580
are you looking for someone,ma'am?

100
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,450
Oh,gosh. I'm gonna pretend that
you didn't just call me "ma'am,"

101
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,100
because I have this image of you and me in my
head playing doctor,and that just kinda ruined it.

102
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:58,200
Okay,I'm gonna go back to work
now,but good luck with,uh,whatever.

103
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,890
Well,I am looking for a doctor.

104
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,970
Gosh,I guess she's a patient now.

105
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,390
Um,isobel stevens.

106
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,080
I'm,uh...

107
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,340
I'm an old friend.

108
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:09,910
After you.

109
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,930
Oh,a doctor and a gentleman.
Now that's a double yummy.

110
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,410
Oh,my god! Who's getting married?

111
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,010
Oh,my god. Mom.

112
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,960
-What are you doing here?
-Mom?

113
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,280
Now shush,cricket.

114
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,280
you don't want that hot
doctor to think I'm old.

115
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,650
You got paged,too?

116
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,910
Yeah. Report to the chief's office,stat.

117
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:37,490
What do-- what do you think?
Why?Why--why would he page us stat?

118
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,650
I don't know. Did we kill
anyone lately and don't remember?

119
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,350
your father's here.

120
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,650
He's 29 days sober,just out of rehab.

121
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,860
He's taking it seriously.
He's working his steps.

122
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:59,460
The ninth step is to make
amends wherever possible.

123
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:04,770
It's the key to an alcoholic's recovery-- to
take responsibility for the wreckage of his past.

124
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,910
I paged you here to ask
you to please hear him out.

125
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:14,040
As a favor to me-- to
please hear him out.

126
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:18,610
-Uh,I'm covering the
pit,chief,and-- I'll cover it.

127
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:21,320
-But there's a trauma coming in.
-I got it,meredith.

128
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,510
Please.

129
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,770
Please.

130
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,210
hey,what are you doing here?

131
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,650
The chief specifically asked
me to cover mer in the pit.

132
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,750
-I'm on hunt's service all month.
-O'malley.

133
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,140
Hey there now.

134
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,340
Uh,o'malley,update me.

135
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,730
Uh,two ambulances. Three patients,one
critical. Multiple gunshot wounds.

136
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,850
Mike carlson,35,multiple G.S.W.S.

137
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,310
Last B.P.--88 systolic
after 2 boluses of L.R.

138
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,260
-Where hos he st?
-Chest,abdomen,back,legs,shoulder.

139
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,640
-Someone meant business.
-I'm not so sure about that.

140
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,200
She didn't mean it. It was an accident.

141
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,100
She really didn't mean it. She's
sorry. Maddy,tell 'em you're sorry.

142
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,930
She's the shooter?

143
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,940
Somebody page the chief.

144
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,820
-breath sounds are better.
-He's got three to the thoracoabdominal area.

145
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,890
What does that bring the count up to?

146
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,050
These plree,us seven to the legs-- that's
te--no,actually,there's two on the side here.

147
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,360
Could be through and through. Put a
swab through and see where it goes.

148
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,480
-should we roll him now?
-Finish his catheter.

149
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,730
Does it enter and exit?

150
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,020
Hold on. Eah,yH. That makes 11.

151
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,110
What can we infer from these injuries?

152
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,320
There's blood in the
urine,so I'm guessing kidney.

153
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,210
Okay,o'malley,let's
roll him on your count.

154
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,540
Okay,one,two,three.

155
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,030
-Oh,yeah. There's more wounds back here.
-Yang,page shepherd.

156
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,040
Let's make sure we get an accurate
count while we have him positioned.

157
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,800
maddy,how's this feel?

158
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,630
Does it hurt when I do this?

159
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,310
Good. Now what about this cut?

160
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:02,410
Can you tell me how you got
this big cut on your face?

161
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:03,850
She's scared.

162
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,600
She's scared she did a bad thing
and you're gonna take her away from m

163
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:10,280
the police will want to talk to both
of you about how maddy got the gun.

164
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,820
We called social services,and
they'll be here soon.

165
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,550
And they'll give you all the support
that you need to come back from this.

166
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,710
And nobody is gonna take
you away from your mom.

167
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:20,290
Okay,maddy? You hear me?

168
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:23,750
It hit her in the face--
the gun,the kickback.

169
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,130
'Cause this doesn't look like--
that's how she got the cut.

170
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,320
Her daddy shoots
targets in the backyard.

171
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,710
He put the gun down for a minute.

172
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,010
It was stupid. It was really stupid.

173
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,920
She never meant to hurt him.

174
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:41,800
Okay,you'll tell the police
that,and it'll--it'll be okay.

175
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,100
Everything will be okay.

176
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,830
I'm s-- I'm so
deeply s-sorry...

177
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:57,340
for every time that I ever hurt you
or disappointed you or let you down.

178
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:05,270
I don't deserve your forgiveness.

179
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:12,710
But I hope-- I-I so hope-- that you'll
give me the opportunity to earn it.

180
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,780
Thank you.

181
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:32,910
Uh,congratulations on... you seem well.

182
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,630
Good luck.

183
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,450
and then you remember
jade from 114? Well...

184
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,050
she had a spot of cancer last
year. It was breast cancer.

185
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,380
That was such a shame,I thought,'cause
she had such a great rack.

186
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,710
God,do you remember what
a great rack she had?

187
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,920
You used to do all those little exercises like
this to try to get yours to grow like hers.

188
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,160
anyway,my point is,jade-- well,she
had 'em cut off-- both of 'em,

189
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:17,030
just to be on the safe side--
and they look even better now.

190
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:21,280
No,for real. Life gave her
lemons and she made cantaloupes.

191
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,470
so maybe,I don't know,maybe,honey,there's
an upside in this for you,too,right?

192
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,470
Um,mom,just,uh,just listen,okay?

193
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,120
I... I don'tave breast cancer.

194
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:41,130
Okay,I have skin cancer,or what
started out as skin cancer--

195
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,510
wait,hang on.Skin cancer?

196
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,190
Oh,god! Isobel stevens.

197
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,410
Oh,you scared the hell out of me.

198
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:52,660
And then you made me come all the way up
here to seattle just for some ugly old mole?

199
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,030
-Oh,sweetie.
-No,I didn'T.

200
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,080
I didn't make you come up here.
I,uh,I didn't even call you.

201
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:01,450
I'm--I'm really--I'm
curious. Who did?

202
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,820
Who called?

203
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,110
Who called her?

204
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:08,790
Seriously,who called her?

205
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:15,820
You okay? Are you crying?

206
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,980
-My dad's here.
-Okay.

207
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:21,890
He's here and he's sober,and I would
really like for you to meet him.

208
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,760
H-how about dinner,tonight?
Camparo's at 8:00?

209
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,260
uh,lexie,uh...

210
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:35,470
dads historically do not love me.

211
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:39,880
And by that I mean that
when I was a-a teenager,um,

212
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,310
dads did-- did
not love me.

213
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:46,020
And... and that's the last
time I had to meet anyone's dad.

214
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:47,940
I'm crazy about you.

215
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,050
And--and I know that
my dad would be,too.

216
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:52,060
You have nothing to worry about.

217
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:54,010
That's what you said when
you told me to tell derek.

218
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,960
Lexie,I'm closer to your
dad's age than yours.

219
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,790
So I'm thinking
he-- he may not...

220
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,390
love me so much.

221
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,770
You know,what we have is fantastic.

222
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:07,960
Why don't we just... keep it for us?

223
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,480
Excuse me. I'm looking for
my sister--karen zelmann.

224
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,570
Well,I have a willow
zelmann in--in there.

225
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:15,350
-Her name is karen.
-My name is willow!

226
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,470
I told you.

227
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,490
I told you this would happen. I told you
to come down out of the damn tree,karen.

228
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,070
Uh,how'd it go?

229
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:30,600
Ooh,Dr. Grey,if you're free,maddy here could use a little
cleaning and laceration repair,'cause I'm being paged.

230
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,020
Absolutely.

231
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,020
Meredith.

232
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,540
-Are you okay?
-I'm great.

233
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,800
Thanks.

234
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,090
Hey,maddym I'Dr. Grey.

235
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:46,390
You mind if I take a look
at that cut on your face?

236
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:49,700
You know,she's so sorry. She's so sorry.

237
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,380
Is my daddy gonna die?

238
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:58,330
I don't know. I hope not.

239
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,260
five bullets still inside.

240
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:01,490
How many gunshots total?

241
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,960
There are 25 wounds
total. 5 are lodged inside.

242
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,340
Two graze wounds,nine through
and throughs so 17 bullets.

243
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,580
17?

244
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,790
I thought this was an
accidental shooting.

245
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,320
How come?

246
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,760
How come what?

247
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:18,800
How come he don't die?
I shot him lots of times.

248
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,390
how come he don't die?

249
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:33,380
" She's just a little girl,a baby.

250
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,180
She wasn't really trying
to kill him. She was...

251
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:39,600
she doesn't even
understand what that means.

252
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,900
She was just trying to stop him.
She was only trying to stop him.

253
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,800
So that cut on her face
didn't come from the gun?

254
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:47,430
He was hitting her.

255
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,470
He loves us.

256
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:52,730
Daddy loves us,maddy. And
sometimes he just gets mad.

257
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,690
And he's been working on it.

258
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:57,530
He's been working on it so hard.

259
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,660
But she was just trying to stop him.

260
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,900
she wasn't trying to kill him.

261
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,210
Please understand.

262
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,730
She's just a little girl.

263
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:15,050
Oh,really?

264
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,250
Really?

265
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,040
Oh,yeah,that's great. That's great.

266
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,500
Oh,thank you.

267
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:25,000
Yes,thank you,hon. Thanks a million.

268
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,240
oh,that's great news,cricket.

269
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,370
You're gonna be just fine.

270
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,200
Oh,yeah?

271
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,980
Let me guess.

272
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:37,020
Your psychic told you that?

273
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,490
It's not just any old psychic. He's
the best that I've ever heard of.

274
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:45,140
Anyway,he said that skin cancer
is highly curable if caught early.

275
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,040
Oh,that's so great. A
psychic with internet access.

276
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,420
Let me guess how much
that call cost you,mother.

277
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:53,490
$19. 99 a minute?

278
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:58,040
Well,when you have a sick child,cricket,money's
not really the first thing on your mind.

279
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,990
you seem like a very
capable doctor,Dr. Bailey.

280
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:05,630
Can I trust that you caught my
daughter's skin cancer early?

281
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,600
well,uh,Mrs.
Stevens--

282
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,480
oh,no.Call me robbie,hon.

283
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,620
No,mom.Don't call her hon.

284
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:14,630
Don't call bailey hon.

285
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:17,950
You know,if you have
questions you can just ask me.

286
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:23,300
She's very busy,and this thing
I have,it's complicated,so...

287
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:27,170
I know it's complicated,isobel.
I'm not a complete idiot.

288
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:29,690
Now I saw this thing on tyra's show.

289
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:32,550
There was this woman who had
a mole on her private parts.

290
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,450
and the dermatologist did not bother to check her
privates ause she thought that the gynie woulda done it.

291
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,410
Now the gynie didn't do it.

292
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,520
Maybe she didn't even go to the gynie.

293
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,530
I don't know. Anyway,it was bad.

294
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,050
She was bald and everything.

295
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,630
She did not have a mole on
her private parts,did she?

296
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,560
no,ma'am.

297
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,740
No,she did not.

298
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,600
good.

299
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,360
We need to take him in now. G.S.W.S to the
abdomen,hematuria,vitals signs are unstable.

300
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,430
Ma'am,he has major internal injuries.
We're rushing him to surgery now.

301
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,900
Wait!

302
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,100
Maddy needs to tell her daddy
she's sorry before he goes.

303
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,370
Baby,you need to tell
your daddy you're sorry.

304
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,190
Maddy,people die in surgery.

305
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:15,740
You don't want your daddy to die
without telling him how sorry you are.

306
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:18,220
Come on. Let's go tell him we love him.

307
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:20,680
You know,no.

308
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,170
-No.
-What?

309
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,020
Maddy,stay right here,okay?

310
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:27,440
-Dr. Grey-- no,she will
not go apologize to him.

311
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,440
You should be apologizing to her.

312
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,090
I understand you're a victim here,

313
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:34,130
but there is no room for you to be a
victim when your 6 year old is on the line.

314
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,610
She's stronger than you.

315
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,530
Your 6 year old is stronger than you.

316
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:39,840
At least she did something.

317
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:43,130
She stood up for the two of you,which
is more than you did for her.

318
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,060
No,she won't apologize to him.

319
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,180
Thank you so much. All
right. I'll call you back.

320
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,400
Listen,I have great news.

321
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,850
I have an associate who has a
contact at schuster and werner.

322
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,630
More like dirtbag and felon.

323
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:03,610
They've agreed to pay your medical
bills and to not sue you for trespassing

324
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,850
if you sign a contract
saying you won't sue them

325
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,630
and you won't trespass on any
of their properties ever again.

326
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:12,610
Do you know how many acres of forest
they have single-handedly destroyed,

327
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:15,980
how many ecosystems
will never be restored?

328
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:19,280
The bees are dying,julie.
The temperature is rising.

329
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:22,930
I'm sorry. Is it possible I could
have a moment alone with my sister?

330
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,510
you will sign this de,karen.

331
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,600
My name is willow!

332
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,340
I can't say I'm sorry
I never had siblings.

333
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,080
They're yelling 'cause they care.

334
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:39,250
-That how it works?
-Yeah,it is.

335
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,010
In some families,it is.

336
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,500
I expected them to yell,you know?

337
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,340
I didn't expect silence.

338
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,170
Why don't you call 'em and
claim temporary insanity?

339
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,270
You don't have to end it with
roller girl. Just say you did.

340
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,750
Yang said the same thing.

341
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,190
That's because it's
none of their business.

342
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:59,500
There's no reason you should
have to hurt this much.

343
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,840
I can see that you're... angry with me.

344
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:15,940
-And maybe angry with your
mother,-but-- don't do that.

345
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,460
I'm not your friend and
I am not your family.

346
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,600
You don't get to call me into
your office on personal business,

347
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:24,100
and you don't get to speak
to me this way right now.

348
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,660
It's an abuse of power.

349
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,350
I'm a resident. I work for you.

350
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,500
You have to speak to
me like I'm a resident.

351
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,170
And for the record,chief,somebody
had to stand up for that little girl,

352
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:34,860
and I make no apologies for that.

353
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:40,050
You want to just be a resident?

354
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,810
Fine.

355
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,610
All right,then.

356
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:49,160
That woman is a victim
of domestic violence.

357
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,190
This hospital is supposed to be a safe
place for her to come and tell her story.

358
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:56,450
And as her doctors,it
is our job to help her.

359
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,280
You did not do your job.

360
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:00,910
Instead,you further
battered a battered woman.

361
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,480
-What about that little girl?
-Dr. Grey,

362
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,000
you will stay away from that child.

363
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,120
You will stay away from that family.

364
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,760
You will not come
within 100 feet of them.

365
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,080
And if you do,you will be
suspended from this hospital

366
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:19,230
pending re-evaluation of your emotional
and mental fitness for residency.

367
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,860
& The I.V.C. And the aorta are nicked.
O'malley,get in there with some clips.

368
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:34,290
I'm gonna need thangular vascular clamp.

369
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:37,200
Nothing's stopping.
He's still bleed g out.

370
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,770
Don't move,yang.

371
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,980
I need some more suction in there.

372
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,550
I know.***

373
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,530
-This is not chout riard,meredith.
-It is.

374
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,120
It is about him.

375
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:49,310
Because I have to deal with him
on a professional basisevery day,

376
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:52,320
and I have tried to draw a
line,and he won't respect it.

377
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,120
He doesn't respect it and he
uses his relationship with you--

378
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,530
-richard doesn't use his
relation-- stop defending him.

379
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:58,600
Be on my side.

380
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,370
-I need you to be on my side.
-Okay.

381
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,550
He's not your best friend.
He's not your cristina.

382
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:06,350
Which is why I feel like it's okay to say
to you he is not invited to our wedding.

383
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,750
Because I swear,derek,if
he is there,I won't be.

384
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,640
And I'm the bride,so I have to be.

385
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,480
So I'm begging you,please.

386
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,250
-He's not invited,okay?
-Okay.

387
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:17,030
Thank you.

388
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:22,480
If you don't make this deal,who's gonna
pay your bills,who's gonna take care of you?

389
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,240
They tried to kill me,just
like they killed kaili,

390
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,550
just like they killed all
of those defenseless trees,

391
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:31,250
all of the defenseless creatures
that live in those trees.

392
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:34,210
You are not a defenseless,tree-living
creature,karen.

393
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:38,070
You are an adult woman who made
a conscious decision to trespass.

394
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,260
It was unbelievably stupid,unbelievably
naive-- just unbelievablyirresponsible.

395
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,270
What about the part where
it was unbelievably brave?

396
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,460
Excuse me?

397
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:50,180
Trees may not be my thing,but even if I
thought it w stupid,it was still brave.

398
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:54,220
I mean,she slept in a 200-year-old tree and
watched as a bulldozer knocked her off of it

399
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,340
because she was standing
up for what she believed in.

400
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,340
You have to admit,she's
unbelievably freakin' brave.

401
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,540
How can trees not be your thing?

402
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:07,010
karen? Karen?

403
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:09,430
Damn it.Her pulse is
weak.Let's start her on 0-2.

404
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,510
See if you can get a femoral pulse.

405
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,340
Okay,she's bleeding out from her
femur.We need to get her stabilized.

406
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,730
What's going on?What's
happening to my sister?

407
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:18,680
- Julie,you need to clear out.
- Tell me what's happening with my sister.

408
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,360
- Get her out of here,please.
- Tell me what's happening,please.

409
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:23,010
- Karen.Karen.- put the L.R. On a
rapid transfuser and hang p-rbcs.

410
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,720
Get ready for transport,tell
the O.R. We're on our way now!

411
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,150
- Damn it!
- Damn it!

412
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:28,280
There's too many bleeders.

413
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,380
Hang another bag of o-neg and
get me some fibrin sealant.

414
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,720
- Can I help?
- You are helping.

415
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:35,670
You've got more bleeders
than you have hands.

416
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:36,850
Sorry.

417
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,130
no,no,that's it.

418
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,980
You,get in here and take over for yang.

419
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,650
Yang,run to my truck.

420
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,930
- What?
- Run to my truck.

421
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,600
It's where I always park it.Run fast.

422
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:47,890
In the glovebox,there's a green bag.

423
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,220
Pull harder on that
retractor,would you?Really get in--

424
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:52,270
- I'm a surgeon.Why are you having--
I'm trying to save a life here,yang.

425
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:54,640
Run!

426
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:02,110
ooh,the lovers card.

427
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:04,060
do you know what this means?

428
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:08,110
Yes.No.Yes.I'm--mom,can
you please just shut up?

429
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,180
Okay? It's meat.

430
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,660
Definitely some kind of meat.

431
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,930
You're killing me,you know that?

432
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:14,760
It means that the sex is hot.

433
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:18,690
Now I bet that little old mole doesn't
get in the way of that.Am I right?

434
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:22,450
Honey,hey,listen,isn't
it time for my scan?

435
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,570
Isn't it time for my scan right now?

436
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,790
I'll--I'll go check,see if I
can get things moving along.

437
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,600
Thank you.

438
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,720
So tell me about Dr. Hottie.

439
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,270
How long have you all been together?

440
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,410
Mom...

441
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:40,500
it's not just a mole.

442
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:42,840
I have stage iv melanoma.

443
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,870
It's in my organs.It's not just a mole.

444
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:52,180
Now you don't have skin on your organs,hon.That
doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

445
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:56,370
don't just sigh at me,isobel.

446
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,840
Just,you know,just explain.

447
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,510
Okay.Um...

448
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:07,730
you remember when-- when grammy
had that tumor on her thyroid?

449
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:12,540
Grammy died.She died.

450
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:18,150
She...really soon after that,she died.

451
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:27,740
Wh-- what are you
t-- telling me...

452
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:31,220
you have a mole.

453
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,020
I don't understand.

454
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,520
You--you just--
you have a mole.

455
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,800
Okay,I'm sorry.

456
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,870
I'm sorry.-- That was
a really bad comparin.

457
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:43,390
What I have is nothing
like what grammy has.

458
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,900
- no.No.
- Okay,I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

459
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,200
Just breathe.

460
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,990
It's okay. I okay.Just breathe,okay?

461
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:54,180
It's okay. it's okay.
I'm okay.Just breathe.

462
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:00,000
Now I've got a good feeling about this.

463
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:05,650
I think those mets are shrunk way down,and I
think I'm gonna go right in and take the rest out.

464
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,190
Really?You think that?

465
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,210
Did your psychic tell you so?

466
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:15,200
This scan has to be
good.It has to be good.

467
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:18,230
L-listen,if it's not,it's
not the end of the world.

468
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,690
- There are other therapies that
we can try-- she'll never leave.

469
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:26,510
If this scan isn't good,if I can't
give her good news,she won't leave.

470
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,080
I love my mom.I don't
mean to sound ungrateful.

471
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,410
- It just...
- it was me.

472
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:33,260
I called her.

473
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,810
I really...

474
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:41,520
- I really thought it was alex
or george-- it was me because...

475
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:46,540
look,I would want to know if my kid was
sick,and if I was sick,I wod want my mom.

476
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:51,850
I just thought that you were being too proud
or that you were just trying to protect her,

477
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:55,810
but now I get that you were
just trying to protect yourself.

478
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:59,350
She's not a bad
person.She was a great mom.

479
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,200
She's just...

480
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,760
limited.She'S...limited.

481
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:07,730
The scan has to be good.

482
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,950
It has to be good.

483
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,450
hang more blood.

484
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:16,380
Come on,willow.

485
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:19,650
Come on,you lived in a tree.You crapped
in a bucket,for god sake.You can do this.

486
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,540
She crapped in a bucket?

487
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:22,780
What are you doing here?

488
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:26,410
Saw it on the board.I've never seen
an intramedullary rod put into a femur.

489
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,760
So... bucket.

490
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:29,880
Yeah.A bucket on a pulley.

491
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:31,390
She's,uh,up in a tree,right?

492
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:37,270
So she lowers a crap bucket to her
friend every day,who empties it,cleans it,

493
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,450
puts food in it and then
sends it back up the tree.

494
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,350
Oh,that's friendship.

495
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,550
yeah.

496
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:49,520
you know,they teach us in med
school how not to care so much.

497
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,560
We drape the patients so
we don't see their faces.

498
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:54,160
We do a thousand different
things to care a little less.

499
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,920
But you care like crazy,and I love that.

500
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:01,430
And I'll keep loving that,even if
you decide to lie to your family.

501
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,130
nice work,yang.

502
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,280
Open the bag.

503
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,660
See the bottle with the blue label?

504
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:14,680
Open it and pour it into a sterile
basin and give it to o'malley.

505
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,560
okay,shake it onto the wound right
over the bleeders,a lot of it.

506
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:22,100
What is this stuff?

507
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,500
Uh,uh,we used it in
the field all the time.

508
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:27,760
It's not F.D.A. Approved,but
it's saved a lot of lives.

509
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:34,120
When,uh,you don't have time to stitch a guy up,you pour some
of this on,and it just holds things until you get him to an O.R.

510
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,090
Oh,look at that.It's
locking up the entire wound.

511
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:38,180
It replicates the
body's clotting process.

512
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:41,590
It's not a permanent
solution,but it buys us some time.

513
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,940
B.P. Is going up.

514
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,110
He's stabilizing.

515
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:47,140
Magical.

516
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,990
I think it's gonna be fine.

517
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,620
I think those mats are
gonna be just teeny ti.

518
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,740
It's,uh,mets,mom.

519
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,340
- Mets.
- Mets?

520
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,340
Like baseball?

521
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:01,450
Yeah,like baseball.

522
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:04,010
okay,uh,good news.

523
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,900
Great news.

524
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,920
The cancer's practically gone.

525
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:12,620
It looks like your psychic
was right,Mrs. Stevens.

526
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,020
Looks like we caught it early after all.

527
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:17,680
Oh,thank you,god!

528
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:20,060
Thank you.Oh,my baby.

529
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,530
Jesus,mary and joseph,thank
you,thank you,thank you.

530
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:28,650
Oh,thank you!thank you!Thank
you!Thank you!Thank you.

531
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,700
But I knew it.

532
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,880
didn't I?

533
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:39,480
I knew it. I knew
because you're my cricket.

534
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:42,050
Nothing can happen to you.

535
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,550
I love you,mom.

536
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,180
Oh,I love you,too,my baby girl.

537
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,870
I love you so,so much.

538
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,920
god,look at me.I must be a mess.

539
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,770
well,I'm gonna go clean up,okay?

540
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:04,130
And then,uh,and then
I'm gonna call jade...

541
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:05,540
and Mrs. Norris,too.

542
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:08,470
I got them all so worried.

543
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,030
just tell me.

544
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:25,010
The mets have shrunk some,but
there are new mets,too--

545
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:28,910
several new mets in the small bowel.

546
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,400
No surgery,then.

547
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:32,190
Oh,I'm gonna operate.

548
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:35,280
I'm going to take out
absolutely everything I can,

549
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:39,020
be as aggressive as I can,and
then we'll take it from there.

550
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,860
- okay.
- Okay.

551
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,540
You just have to give her
some room.You two have history.

552
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:51,450
- I apologized.
- I know,and it's loaded.

553
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,490
She keeps yelling at me
that I am not her father.

554
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,600
Well,I'm not.

555
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,000
I fell in love with her mother.

556
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,180
That's all I did.

557
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,170
Her mother never got over you.

558
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,150
- And she's not gonna--
well,that's not my fault.

559
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:04,260
Look,I was young.

560
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,100
Lots of people have affairs.

561
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,060
They have affairs,and they don't--
look,what ellis did after I left?

562
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,810
That's on ellis.

563
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:13,590
And I'm trying to run a hospital here.

564
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:15,270
She's doing the best she can,richard.

565
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,600
Well,her best isn't good enough.

566
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:21,640
If any other resident-- if any other
resident pulled the crap she did today...

567
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,990
she is still here becausof
my history with you.

568
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,680
That's it.That's the only reason.

569
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,300
You keep saying you're not her
father,but-- okay,you know what?

570
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:30,610
Since we're talking,you're the
most professional guy I know,

571
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:33,630
most levelheaded,except when
it comes to meredith grey.

572
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,150
You gave me hell.

573
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,770
You know,you weren't gonna give me
chief because I was dating meredith grey.

574
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:38,930
You told her about the ring.

575
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,690
You sent her out to the
woods to bring me back.

576
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,420
That's not running a hospital.

577
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,490
You paged her to your
office to try on dresses.

578
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:46,670
You paged her again today for thatcher.

579
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,920
You have history with her.

580
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,070
You keep saying that
you're not her father.

581
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,480
But the way you act?

582
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,950
You consider her family.

583
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,970
For what it's worth...

584
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:04,730
what happened?

585
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,640
Hunt is incredible.The
guy shouldn't be alive.

586
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:09,040
17 bullets.He has one lung.

587
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:10,410
He's got one kidney left.

588
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,170
- Dr. Grey.
- Meredith.

589
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:15,750
I'm sorry for the way
I spoke to you earlier.

590
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:16,970
- Dr. Grey.
- Meredith,don'T.

591
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:22,510
I know I was out of line,and I know I can't
possibly imagine what you've been through.

592
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:25,960
But I also know that this
cannot be your daughter's story--

593
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,070
that she shot her dad 17 times to
protect her mom,and you went back to him.

594
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:37,610
You have to change her story while you
still have a chance,for both of you.

595
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:40,550
But for her,but for your little girl...

596
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:44,060
you have to change her story.

597
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,290
I'll pack my stuff.

598
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:08,930
She lost a lot of
blood,but she's stable now.

599
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:15,560
They weighed the cost.

600
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,920
I'm sorry?

601
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,530
They weighed the cost of killing
her over letting her stay up there.

602
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:26,040
And then they got a bulldozer and
they knocked her out of a tree.

603
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:30,520
They knocked my baby
sister out of a tree.

604
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,190
jules.

605
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:36,190
I'm here.

606
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,680
Hey,I'm here.

607
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,910
I filed a lawsuit against schuster
and werner-- a $10-million lawsuit.

608
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:48,320
We're gonna make those
bastards pay for this.

609
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:50,240
You hear me?

610
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:52,190
I'm gonna make them pay.

611
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:56,670
We could plant so many
trees with $10 million.

612
00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:01,440
and when we win,the check
will be made out to "karen.

613
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,380
Our tree girl made it through?

614
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:19,930
I can't lie,even if they think I'm wrong,even if
they don't understand,even if they think I'm crazy.

615
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,390
I'm me.

616
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,860
They're supposed to accept me.

617
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:29,480
They're supposed to support me.They're
supposed to love me,you know?

618
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:35,050
I can't lie.

619
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,300
oh,great.

620
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:56,930
Is this another
heart-to-heart?

621
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:58,790
I know you don't like me.

622
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:01,400
And you have every right not to like me.

623
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:06,000
I have abused my power,but now I'm here
on your turf,and what I need to say...

624
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,910
what I need to say is...

625
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:11,100
I saw what your mother was doing.

626
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:17,500
I saw how neglected you were,I saw her drive your father
off,and I spent a lot of time beating myself up about that.

627
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:18,850
But what does that do for you?

628
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,210
Nothing.

629
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,230
Nothing.

630
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:27,230
I wasn't your advocate.

631
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,610
I didn't fight for you.

632
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:32,850
I never stood up for you.

633
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,920
I let myself off the hook.

634
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:40,670
I told myself I was young and didn't
know any better,but I did know better.

635
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:43,550
I wasn't much younger than you are now.

636
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,710
I should've fought for you,meredith...

637
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:53,440
like you fought for that child today.

638
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:59,790
I told myself that I wasn't your father,that it wasn't
my responsibility,that I was right not to butt in.

639
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,680
I let myself off the hook.

640
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:16,810
You were helpless.

641
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:20,030
You were... you were a baby...

642
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:22,120
a beautiful...

643
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:25,640
smart,funny little girl...

644
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:31,190
and no one stood up for you.

645
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:39,260
I'm so sorry.

646
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:46,670
I'm so sorry.

647
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:56,650
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

648
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:04,680
As doctors,we can't undo our mistakes,and
we rarely forgive ourselves for them,

649
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,510
but it's a hazard of the trade.

650
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:11,850
But as human beings,we can always
try to do better,to be better,

651
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,040
to right a wrong even
when it feels irreversible.

652
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:18,110
Are you sure you don't want me to stay?

653
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:23,140
I'm sure. I'm okay. I'll be okay.

654
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:28,280
Well... if you're not,you
know where to find me.

655
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:36,330
I love you,mom. I love you so much.

656
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:41,500
But we do better lovin'
each other from a distance.

657
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:49,970
you were always too good
for that trailer park...

658
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,800
that I knew.

659
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:57,550
I might not know that much,and I might
not be quite as smart as you,but...

660
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,670
I always knew that.

661
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,170
Of course "I'm sorry"
doesn't always cut it.

662
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:16,850
Maybe because we use it so many
dierent ways-- as a weapon,as an excuse.

663
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,770
Nice work today.

664
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:21,320
"Nice work today"?Seriously?

665
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:22,570
I'm sorry?

666
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,000
"Run to my truck.

667
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:26,700
" You've got o'malley clping bleeders,and
you're telling me to run to your truck.

668
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,790
You know what my truck
looks like.O'malley doesn'T.

669
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,340
And that--that run you
took?It saved a guy's life.

670
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,300
Yeah,well,all day...all day you were
teaching o'malley and you ignored me.

671
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:35,810
O'malley wants to be a trauma surgeon.

672
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:36,960
You've already declared cardio.

673
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:39,070
I didn't do anything wrong today.

674
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,360
I treated you like I would anyone else.

675
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:43,300
no,not like anyone else.

676
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:45,780
"Take care now"?! What is that?!

677
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,580
What,are you,like,you know,happy now?

678
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,970
What--what
are you?

679
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:52,530
You know,just a "choke 'em
and forget 'em" kinda guy?

680
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:05,370
"hey there now.Take care
now.Nice work,yang." What is this?

681
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:09,810
It's my shrink.My shrink gave me these sentences--
we--we,uh,we came up with them together.

682
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:14,560
They're all 3-word sentences so I'd have things to
say to you instead of the three words that are...

683
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,890
that are killing me...

684
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:25,540
the three words that you know
I feel but I can't say them,

685
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:29,830
because it would be cruel to say
them because I am no good for you.

686
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:32,380
I don't want to torture you.

687
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:36,210
I don't want to look at you longingly
when I know I can't be with you.

688
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:41,220
So,yeah,I'm smiling and
I'm saying "take care now.

689
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:47,660
" I'm letting you off the hook.

690
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,340
I'm trying.I'm trying so
hard to let you off the hook.

691
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,900
I'm trying to make it
right,what I did to you.

692
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:58,220
Can't you see that?I'm just
trying to make it right.

693
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:07,020
take care now.

694
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:30,370
But when we are really sorry,when
we use it right,when we mean it...

695
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:33,160
we're leaving...

696
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,790
for good.We're leaving.

697
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,360
And as I understand it,you'll be
too weak to follow us anytime soon,

698
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:42,290
so I'm pretty sure you won't
be able to follow us later.

699
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,410
So...

700
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,970
we're here to say good-bye.

701
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:51,690
Maddy,say good-bye to daddy.This
is the last you'll be seeing of him.

702
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:55,850
Bye,daddy.Feel better.

703
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:06,680
Bye,Dr. Grey.

704
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:08,940
Bye,maddy.

705
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:20,950
When our actions say
what words never can...

706
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,760
sorry I'm late.

707
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:33,240
d-dad,this is,um,mark sloan.

708
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:34,630
Dr. Mark sloan.

709
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,840
- He--he's
my,uh-- teacher?

710
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:40,910
no,no.He--he's
my...

711
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:42,840
he'S...mark.

712
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:44,780
Nice to meet you,Mr. Grey.

713
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,350
It's so nice to meet you.

714
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:52,570
please,grab a chair.

715
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:09,340
Okay,that tastes like shrimp.

716
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,080
Alex...

717
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:14,260
okay,but listen,the
shrimp kinda tastes...

718
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:18,110
sweet and spicy,you know,kinda
like our first date-- the good part,

719
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,540
the part before I didn't
kiss you on the front porch.

720
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:22,900
okay,nice.

721
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:28,840
And the chicken tastes like a drive to the beach with
the windows down and the dog hanging out the window,

722
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,140
like when you were a kid,like,salty.

723
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,770
It tastes good,but I'd definitely go
for the shrimp if we have to choose.

724
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:37,700
There's one more.

725
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,560
Okay,yeah.

726
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:43,450
That tastes like crap.

727
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:46,390
okay,the O.R.'S prepped and ready.

728
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:47,780
How about you?

729
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,650
Yeah,ready.

730
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:04,900
Now I taste like crap.

731
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:22,640
when we get it right,"I'm
sorry" is perfect.

732
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:32,990
Hey,so,um,we have to move
the wedding up for izzie.

733
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,900
She'S...

734
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,920
okay.

735
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:40,260
You're packing up your mom's journals.

736
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,920
Yeah.You know,there's
nothing in these for me.

737
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,550
I keep thinkin but I don't know.

738
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:47,890
I don't want to throw them away,so
I was gonna give 'em to the chief.

739
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:54,960
And...he can come to
the wedding if you want.

740
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,910
He can come.

741
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:58,660
Okay.

742
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,880
When we get it right...

743
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,210
"I'm sorry" is redemption.
