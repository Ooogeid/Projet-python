1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:01,529
Previously...

2
00:00:01,654 --> 00:00:03,172
I have an 18-year-old daughter.

3
00:00:03,297 --> 00:00:06,297
I'm having a baby, and,
I don't have anywhere else to go.

4
00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:07,882
Have you seen the Chief?

5
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,426
There's something wrong
with his emergency chole patient.

6
00:00:10,551 --> 00:00:13,331
You may have accidentally
clipped the common bile duct.

7
00:00:13,456 --> 00:00:16,390
That's one of the most serious mistakes
a general surgeon can make.

8
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:18,517
Have you told anyone what you saw?

9
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,185
Have you told Derek?

10
00:00:22,044 --> 00:00:23,794
I have loved you forever.

11
00:00:24,095 --> 00:00:25,895
I'm in love with Cristina.

12
00:00:30,573 --> 00:00:33,199
<i>We assume the really
serious changes in our lives</i>

13
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:34,667
<i>happen slowly...</i>

14
00:00:35,987 --> 00:00:36,987
<i>over time.</i>

15
00:00:38,683 --> 00:00:40,083
<i>But it's not true.</i>

16
00:00:41,221 --> 00:00:43,125
<i>The big stuff happens in an instant.</i>

17
00:00:47,737 --> 00:00:50,531
- You're up early.
- Yeah, I want to, get some stuff done

18
00:00:50,656 --> 00:00:53,141
so that I can meet the Chief
this afternoon. He's gonna

19
00:00:53,266 --> 00:00:55,766
- show me another old surgery tape.
- Again?

20
00:00:55,891 --> 00:00:59,222
Every night this week. I thought
last night was the last time.

21
00:00:59,347 --> 00:01:01,044
He got held up.
He couldn't make it.

22
00:01:01,169 --> 00:01:03,286
I went by his office on my way out.

23
00:01:03,411 --> 00:01:05,022
He was sound asleep on his couch.

24
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:08,198
Which is why he couldn't make it.

25
00:01:08,871 --> 00:01:12,071
I think maybe he just
doesn't sleep well at home with

26
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:13,989
Adele gone.

27
00:01:26,649 --> 00:01:28,449
I need something from you.

28
00:01:32,395 --> 00:01:33,395
That, too.

29
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,262
I need you to give Sloan
an ultrasound today.

30
00:01:37,028 --> 00:01:38,663
It's been almost three weeks.

31
00:01:38,788 --> 00:01:40,688
Can't someone from OB do it?

32
00:01:44,758 --> 00:01:45,958
She likes you.

33
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:48,233
All the sloans do.

34
00:01:51,098 --> 00:01:52,698
Do we have any more...

35
00:01:55,601 --> 00:01:56,782
<i>Becoming an adult,</i>

36
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,350
<i>becoming a parent,</i>

37
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:00,161
<i>becoming a doctor...</i>

38
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:03,283
<i>One minute you're not,
and the next...</i>

39
00:02:04,139 --> 00:02:05,146
<i>You are.</i>

40
00:02:05,271 --> 00:02:07,236
- Sorry about that.
- Whatever.

41
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:09,642
- There's no more cereal.
- Why are you sorry?

42
00:02:09,767 --> 00:02:11,915
She's the one who didn't knock
before she came in.

43
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,340
I'll get some cereal this afternoon.

44
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,351
How about some juice?

45
00:02:16,696 --> 00:02:18,619
Lexie's gonna give you
an ultrasound today.

46
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,640
Why don't you pick up
some breakfast at the hospital?

47
00:02:21,765 --> 00:02:24,965
- It's gonna be more.
- You need some for lunch, too?

48
00:02:26,984 --> 00:02:29,065
- I'm gonna shower.
- Can you hold on a minute?

49
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:31,633
I'm probably gonna have
to hurl this.

50
00:02:36,514 --> 00:02:39,196
Sloan Sloan monopolizing
your bathroom again?

51
00:02:39,321 --> 00:02:40,321
Yours?

52
00:02:40,446 --> 00:02:41,496
Owen's in mine.

53
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:49,709
They're in there.

54
00:02:49,834 --> 00:02:52,278
- You should knock first.
- I'm late. My hair is dirty.

55
00:02:52,403 --> 00:02:54,840
And he just gave her 80 bucks
for a muffin and a sandwich.

56
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,734
That's quite a sandwich.

57
00:02:56,859 --> 00:02:59,821
She's end up spending it on a pair
of jeans that show off her butt crack,

58
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:01,930
then she's gonna ask me
for half of my salad.

59
00:03:02,055 --> 00:03:03,486
You sound like my mother.

60
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:06,769
- Knock much?
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

61
00:03:07,232 --> 00:03:09,021
There's no more hot water.

62
00:03:13,926 --> 00:03:15,176
<i>Ask any doctor,</i>

63
00:03:15,588 --> 00:03:17,988
<i>and they can point to the one moment</i>

64
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,860
<i>they became physician.</i>

65
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:22,660
<i>It usually isn't med school
graduation day.</i>

66
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:25,606
You're going solo today.

67
00:03:25,731 --> 00:03:27,445
- Been there.
- Cardio solo.

68
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,359
Whatever it is...</i>
- Valve replacement.

69
00:03:29,484 --> 00:03:30,884
<i>Nobody forgets it.</i>

70
00:03:31,076 --> 00:03:33,076
- Porcine or...
- Mechanical.

71
00:03:33,323 --> 00:03:35,190
So I can try out
the subannular stitches.

72
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,633
I didn't teach it to you
so you could crochet.

73
00:03:37,964 --> 00:03:39,264
Okay, thank you.

74
00:03:40,758 --> 00:03:43,097
- Oh, my God.
- What? What?

75
00:03:43,887 --> 00:03:45,975
Altman's letting her
go solo on a valve.

76
00:03:47,633 --> 00:03:49,200
- You feel ready?
- She's ready.

77
00:03:49,325 --> 00:03:50,758
She just needs to breathe.

78
00:03:50,883 --> 00:03:52,870
I am breathing. I am...

79
00:03:53,521 --> 00:03:56,058
a living, breathing
cardiothoracic surgeon

80
00:03:56,183 --> 00:03:57,611
as of right now.

81
00:03:58,249 --> 00:03:59,649
I have to go prep.

82
00:04:01,014 --> 00:04:03,514
<i>Sometimes you don't even know
anything's changed.</i>

83
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:07,189
<i>You think you're still you
and your life is still your life,</i>

84
00:04:07,844 --> 00:04:09,711
<i>but you wake up day and look around,</i>

85
00:04:09,836 --> 00:04:12,086
<i>and you don't recognize anything...</i>

86
00:04:12,487 --> 00:04:13,711
<i>Not anything at all.</i>

87
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,050
<i>Season 06 episode 11
Blink</i>

88
00:04:18,002 --> 00:04:21,069
Do you have any cash?
I lost the headset to my phone.

89
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,470
How about you hold
the phone up to your ear?

90
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:26,759
You were the one that was bitching at me
last night for being on the phone.

91
00:04:26,884 --> 00:04:29,135
If I had a headset,
I wouldn't have to talk so loud.

92
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,865
If you had your own apartment,
you could talk whenever you want,

93
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,830
but we're all making compromises.

94
00:04:34,864 --> 00:04:37,735
- Here's the head.
- It looks like alien.

95
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:41,429
- It's gonna be a very cute alien.
- A boy alien or girl?

96
00:04:43,447 --> 00:04:45,647
Dude, does it have a thing or not?

97
00:04:45,954 --> 00:04:47,804
I'm not looking at the sex.

98
00:04:48,851 --> 00:04:49,851
I don't...

99
00:04:51,678 --> 00:04:54,045
You... I'm new at this.
I'm... not very good.

100
00:04:55,334 --> 00:04:57,057
Why don't we go upstairs to...

101
00:04:57,182 --> 00:04:58,979
There's a better machine upstairs.

102
00:04:59,104 --> 00:05:01,756
Maybe we'll have
someone else take a look.

103
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,595
Adamson, you're with me.
Meredith, you're with Bailey.

104
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:07,275
Karev, you're with Torres.
Tom Kates is in this ambulance.

105
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,477
The quarterback?

106
00:05:08,602 --> 00:05:10,426
If you see photographers,
call security.

107
00:05:10,551 --> 00:05:12,503
Tell your interns no autographs,
no pictures

108
00:05:12,628 --> 00:05:15,195
I see anyone pull out a camera phone,
it's going in the toilet.

109
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,152
So there are three of us
on one patient?

110
00:05:17,277 --> 00:05:20,054
He's a high-profile patient.
He gets a lot of attention.

111
00:05:20,179 --> 00:05:22,238
I thought we agreed
to stop meeting like this?

112
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:24,451
What can I say?
I missed your smiling face.

113
00:05:24,576 --> 00:05:26,176
- Good to see you.
- Head trauma,

114
00:05:26,301 --> 00:05:28,494
but GCS 15 since
regaing consciousness.

115
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:31,747
He got high/lowed by a couple of their
linebackers. Dropped like a rock.

116
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:35,379
- Get x-ray in here for a trauma series.
- Tenderness in the upper left quadrant.

117
00:05:35,504 --> 00:05:37,070
- I'm gonna need a CT.
- Got it.

118
00:05:37,195 --> 00:05:39,026
There's pain and crepitance
in the knee.

119
00:05:39,151 --> 00:05:41,918
Get an x-ray of the left
knee with the trauma series.

120
00:05:42,978 --> 00:05:46,762
I saw that hit. That was a bad hit.
I knew it the minute I saw it.

121
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,145
I knew before you even hit the ground,
that was bad.

122
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,856
- Hi, sweetheart. And that's my boy.
- He's very cute.

123
00:05:51,981 --> 00:05:53,952
- Dr. Shepherd...
- He's gonna be fine.

124
00:05:54,077 --> 00:05:56,253
Now I can't have you in here
with the baby.

125
00:05:56,378 --> 00:05:58,052
Littlest high-five in the world.

126
00:05:58,177 --> 00:06:00,787
We'll come and find you the second
we know what's going on.

127
00:06:00,912 --> 00:06:03,579
I love you. Don't give him too much
morphine. It makes him goofy.

128
00:06:03,704 --> 00:06:05,479
- I won't.
- How great is that kid?

129
00:06:05,604 --> 00:06:07,004
He's pretty great.

130
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,530
Did you tell Sloan to move out?

131
00:06:11,262 --> 00:06:14,123
- Not that it's a bad idea, but...
- You're making her feel like crap.

132
00:06:14,292 --> 00:06:16,945
She said you wouldn't even be alone
in a room with her.

133
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,128
Then why do I have to
chaperone the ultrasound?

134
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:22,146
Because there's something wrong
with the baby.

135
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:25,345
See right there on the left thigh.

136
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:28,207
- On his other ankle, too.
- Wait. It's a boy?

137
00:06:28,332 --> 00:06:30,082
I hadn't gotten that far.

138
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:32,057
Sorry. Congratulations.

139
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:34,778
There's a lot of swelling
on the right foot.

140
00:06:34,903 --> 00:06:37,596
- It's very constricted.
- What the hell are you talking about?

141
00:06:37,721 --> 00:06:40,815
The baby's got strands of amniotic
tissue wrapped around his legs.

142
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,447
They're called amniotic bands.

143
00:06:42,572 --> 00:06:44,882
There's a danger of them
compromising one of his limbs.

144
00:06:45,007 --> 00:06:47,852
So what? One of his legs
is gonna, like, fall off?

145
00:06:47,977 --> 00:06:49,735
That's the worst-case scenario.

146
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,970
- He's gonna have stumps?
- We don't know what

147
00:06:52,095 --> 00:06:53,458
we're dealing with yet.

148
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,789
Whatever it is,
we're gonna take care of it.

149
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:58,375
I can't have a stumpy baby.
Can't you fix it?

150
00:06:58,998 --> 00:07:01,085
- I don't know.
- You know, I have an idea.

151
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,425
How about we don't answer
any patient questions

152
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,591
with the phrase: "I don't know"?

153
00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:07,816
We're gonna fix it.

154
00:07:08,147 --> 00:07:09,887
Let's get a fetal MRI.

155
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:12,430
- I'm not sure that I would...
- I wasn't talking to you.

156
00:07:12,555 --> 00:07:13,655
You're done.

157
00:07:14,065 --> 00:07:15,515
I'll be right back.

158
00:07:24,174 --> 00:07:25,974
Get me Addison Montgomery.

159
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,051
I adore you.

160
00:07:32,178 --> 00:07:34,328
I was in the middle of breakfast.

161
00:07:34,676 --> 00:07:37,090
She had an MRI right's worse
than the left

162
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,641
- I just need to say it once.
- Go ahead.

163
00:07:39,766 --> 00:07:40,766
Grandpa.

164
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,715
That was four times.
Is it out of your system?

165
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,840
I don't know.

166
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:51,012
Look at that. He thinks he's got
an opening behind Martin, and then...

167
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,410
Back that up again.

168
00:07:52,535 --> 00:07:54,434
I would never ask for an autograph,

169
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:57,414
but if he signed a consent form and
there was a copy laying around...

170
00:07:57,539 --> 00:07:58,683
What? Big fan.

171
00:07:58,808 --> 00:08:01,105
- What?
- Hey! Look who's here.

172
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,823
- Did you get lost on the freeway?
- What are you doing here?

173
00:08:03,948 --> 00:08:06,226
Sloan's got a little something
going on with the baby.

174
00:08:06,351 --> 00:08:08,082
- Is she okay?
- We'll figure it out.

175
00:08:08,207 --> 00:08:10,322
I'm gonna go see if they're ready.

176
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,517
You know how long
I've been waiting for that?

177
00:08:12,642 --> 00:08:14,993
What, you pull out his blood
with leeches?

178
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,886
- She's perkier than usual.
- Well, divorce will do that to you.

179
00:08:20,523 --> 00:08:22,469
- Sad.
- No, she'll move on and be happy.

180
00:08:22,594 --> 00:08:25,574
- She just needs somebody to move on to.
- Well, that can't be so hard.

181
00:08:26,861 --> 00:08:29,111
Wait. What about you?
Can't you find her someone?

182
00:08:29,236 --> 00:08:31,697
That guy from oncology, the cute one.
Isn't he still here?

183
00:08:31,822 --> 00:08:32,970
This is not my area.

184
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:35,013
He used to play basketball with him.

185
00:08:35,292 --> 00:08:37,031
Torres should do it.
They're friends.

186
00:08:37,156 --> 00:08:39,268
- She thinks I'm loopy.
- You are loopy.

187
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:42,286
Okay, come on. It's Bailey.
She's lonely. I...

188
00:08:44,205 --> 00:08:47,689
He needs a transfusion. That splenic lac
is bleeding more than I thought.

189
00:08:47,814 --> 00:08:50,779
We'll take a look at the CT's
and come up with a, game plan.

190
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:52,610
All set.

191
00:08:53,227 --> 00:08:54,727
I'm coming with you.

192
00:08:57,301 --> 00:08:59,201
You know Dave from oncology?

193
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,539
Single.

194
00:09:00,664 --> 00:09:03,236
You wouldn't be starting a conversation
about my personal life?

195
00:09:03,361 --> 00:09:05,083
Bad idea? He's handsome.

196
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,450
Bad idea.

197
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,214
Okay. I tried.

198
00:09:12,673 --> 00:09:15,666
This is Dr. Yang. She'll be
performing your surgery today.

199
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:18,695
She is the best of the best.
You're gonna like her.

200
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,870
Good. I am so glad to meet you.

201
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:23,959
I have a couple things
I want to discuss.

202
00:09:24,084 --> 00:09:26,109
- Is that... can I...
- Of course...

203
00:09:26,234 --> 00:09:29,535
I have allergies. I know
they write them in the chart, but

204
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,668
I find that if you don't
tell everyone,

205
00:09:31,793 --> 00:09:34,093
it kind of gets lots in the shuffle.

206
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:35,879
Aspirin,

207
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:37,059
ibuprofen,

208
00:09:37,381 --> 00:09:38,382
bananas,

209
00:09:38,507 --> 00:09:39,507
zucchini,

210
00:09:40,008 --> 00:09:43,380
alforms of squash.
And pumpkin is a squash, right?

211
00:09:43,505 --> 00:09:46,105
People forget that.
Latex, dust mites.

212
00:09:47,078 --> 00:09:49,328
I asked the nurse with the red hair

213
00:09:49,453 --> 00:09:50,797
for a new pillow, and,

214
00:09:51,226 --> 00:09:52,956
I would also love
to get a new nurse.

215
00:09:53,081 --> 00:09:55,552
Because I think the redhead
just brought back the old pillow

216
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,222
with a new case, and it's, you know...
It's making me sneezy.

217
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,186
I'm supposed to get a
mechanical valve.

218
00:10:00,311 --> 00:10:02,363
But I've been thinking
about the clicking noise

219
00:10:02,488 --> 00:10:04,561
they say the mechanical
valve makes...

220
00:10:05,077 --> 00:10:08,024
That would be irritating? Don't you
think that might just make you nuts?

221
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:11,401
I'm sorry, but, a different valve
is a whole different procedure.

222
00:10:12,939 --> 00:10:16,058
But I think the pig is a better idea...
the pig valve.

223
00:10:16,183 --> 00:10:18,758
You know, it's organic, right?
And they say they're very clean.

224
00:10:18,883 --> 00:10:21,263
All that business about,
"you're such a pig, "right?

225
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:23,936
That's just bad marketing.
And this, blanket...

226
00:10:24,061 --> 00:10:25,411
This has a smell.

227
00:10:26,034 --> 00:10:27,620
It does smell. Like, a...

228
00:10:27,745 --> 00:10:30,622
I'm not saying it's not clean.
It's like a chemical of some kind,

229
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,006
it's chaffing. Can you see my rash?

230
00:10:33,358 --> 00:10:36,439
As the legs continue to grow,
the bands will cut off his circulation.

231
00:10:36,564 --> 00:10:37,636
If we wait,

232
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,433
we risk severe damage
to the left leg, possible

233
00:10:40,558 --> 00:10:42,408
loss of the right entirely.

234
00:10:42,722 --> 00:10:46,144
But if we operate... 22 weeks,
it's... it's still risky.

235
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,565
If you don't operate,
you're not gonna kill the baby.

236
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,370
We can rehabilitate the remaining
part of his leg after he's born,

237
00:10:51,495 --> 00:10:53,066
we can fit him with a prosthesis.

238
00:10:53,191 --> 00:10:55,525
It's entirely possible
that he'll walk.

239
00:10:56,265 --> 00:10:57,915
We've got options here.

240
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,008
If we operate, Dr. Montgomery can
remove the bands, he'll be just fine.

241
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:06,003
Or we can wait a few weeks
till he's bigger and

242
00:11:06,128 --> 00:11:09,078
stronger, and we know
the surgery is less risky.

243
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,420
Well, which one of you
did he sleep with?

244
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:15,574
Not me.

245
00:11:16,074 --> 00:11:17,224
You told her?

246
00:11:17,827 --> 00:11:19,317
She's my kid. We were bonding.

247
00:11:19,442 --> 00:11:22,133
That is not how you bond
with children.

248
00:11:22,258 --> 00:11:23,918
I'm still getting the hang of it.

249
00:11:24,043 --> 00:11:26,204
So you're sure that he didn't,
like, knock you up

250
00:11:26,329 --> 00:11:28,897
and leave you with a child to raise
on your own or something?

251
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:32,525
You're not just, like, really pissed
and you're trying to get revenge?

252
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,337
It was a long time ago, okay?

253
00:11:36,392 --> 00:11:38,322
The fact is, Mark...

254
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,424
Your father is a good guy,

255
00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:43,006
I think you're a good kid,
I'm gonna do everything I can

256
00:11:43,131 --> 00:11:44,835
to help you with your baby.

257
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,537
Let's just get these things
off his legs right now.

258
00:11:47,662 --> 00:11:48,962
I'll book an OR.

259
00:11:53,855 --> 00:11:56,455
Stupid quarterback
only has a concussion.

260
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,390
- Tragic.
- I know.

261
00:11:58,515 --> 00:12:01,261
I'm on his ortho stuff. There's bound
to be a surgery in there.

262
00:12:01,386 --> 00:12:03,474
- You want to share?
- Why would I do that?

263
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,175
- Cause you like me.
- Not that much.

264
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,025
Sure you do. Come on.
Let me scrub in,

265
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:12,200
and I will take you out
for drinks afterwards and,

266
00:12:12,517 --> 00:12:13,523
you know...

267
00:12:17,238 --> 00:12:18,238
Really?

268
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,105
- What?
- Let me take you out for drinks

269
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:30,630
- and, you know?
- What's "you know"?

270
00:12:31,638 --> 00:12:33,338
- Whatever.
- It's sex.

271
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:36,963
- Get over it.
- You're trading sex for surgery that's

272
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,474
prostitution. Is that the part
I'm supposed to get over?

273
00:12:39,599 --> 00:12:42,138
- Are you calling me a whore?
- Explain what "you know" means.

274
00:12:42,263 --> 00:12:44,479
I'm messing with him.
Karev knows it, and I know it.

275
00:12:44,604 --> 00:12:46,454
He's gonna want to collect.

276
00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:49,029
Go find something else
to worry about.

277
00:13:03,308 --> 00:13:05,701
This is, Dr. Stanton from radiology.

278
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:09,198
Rob, Miranda.
Rob was looking over Tom's CT,

279
00:13:09,323 --> 00:13:11,827
and I thought he should talk to you.
Rob's new here, so

280
00:13:11,952 --> 00:13:15,293
I thought you might give him a tour of
the hospital while you discuss the CT.

281
00:13:19,811 --> 00:13:20,811
Excuse me.

282
00:13:21,135 --> 00:13:22,287
What are you doing?

283
00:13:22,412 --> 00:13:24,678
You spent christmas with me
and Meredith.

284
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:27,698
- That can't be what you want.
- True, but I do have a patient

285
00:13:27,823 --> 00:13:29,746
that I have to do
a follow-up on right now.

286
00:13:29,871 --> 00:13:32,018
- I don't have time to take...
- Follow-up's easy.

287
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,635
I can do that. Have fun. Take care.
Okay, have a good tour.

288
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:37,054
You want to show me the scan?

289
00:13:37,179 --> 00:13:39,479
How about we, look at it over lunch?

290
00:13:43,694 --> 00:13:46,714
I'm in the middle of a divorce.
People call me the nazi,

291
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,008
and it's not because of
my ice blue eyes.

292
00:13:49,133 --> 00:13:52,262
I spend 12 hours a day carving
people up, and I like it.

293
00:13:52,387 --> 00:13:56,217
I have a child, and I have
no room for casual anything.

294
00:13:56,613 --> 00:13:59,569
I'm angry all of the time
and deeply confused

295
00:13:59,694 --> 00:14:02,396
because a lot of people in my
life have let me down recently.

296
00:14:02,521 --> 00:14:05,672
One of them was me. It's devastating,
but not completely,

297
00:14:05,797 --> 00:14:08,500
because it turns out I like
sleeping crosswise in the bed

298
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,223
and not having to shave my legs.

299
00:14:10,348 --> 00:14:13,878
My 3 year old used to be
potty trained, and now he isn't

300
00:14:14,003 --> 00:14:15,935
because his father
no longer lives with us

301
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,912
and his world no longer makes sense,

302
00:14:18,037 --> 00:14:20,860
and the only thing he thinks
he can control is his bladder.

303
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,569
So he urinates

304
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:24,867
in a lot of places
you wish he wouldn't urinate.

305
00:14:24,992 --> 00:14:27,892
You want lunch or you want
to show me the scan?

306
00:14:35,265 --> 00:14:38,705
I'll be filling in for Dr. Bailey today.
So you're here for a follow-up?

307
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,849
I had my gall bladder out
a couple months ago.

308
00:14:40,974 --> 00:14:42,935
Months?
And you're still getting follow-ups?

309
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,205
- I am, once a week.
- Once a week?

310
00:14:45,597 --> 00:14:48,477
Dr. Bailey says she just wants
to make sure I'm in tip-top shape.

311
00:14:48,602 --> 00:14:50,243
Dr. Webber did your surgery?

312
00:14:50,368 --> 00:14:52,068
Chief of surgery. Fancy?

313
00:14:52,682 --> 00:14:56,115
You guys are the best. People say
a lot of crap about health care,

314
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,140
but they've never been here.

315
00:14:58,933 --> 00:15:01,733
- You take care of people.
- We certainly do.

316
00:15:02,477 --> 00:15:05,404
Dr. Bailey was all worried cause
I turned yellow after my first surgery.

317
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:06,655
See? Here.

318
00:15:08,935 --> 00:15:10,285
But it went away.

319
00:15:10,736 --> 00:15:13,100
I'm fine now.
You want to look at my scar

320
00:15:13,225 --> 00:15:15,507
or wait till after I pee in the cup?

321
00:15:15,632 --> 00:15:19,250
Dr. Altman, the patient is no longer
interested in a mechanical valve.

322
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:22,234
I couldn't give you a total
unadulterated dream case.

323
00:15:22,359 --> 00:15:23,513
People would talk.

324
00:15:23,638 --> 00:15:25,810
I just spent hours prepping
for the mechanical.

325
00:15:25,935 --> 00:15:27,844
A pig valve is a whole
different surgery.

326
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:31,221
Two for the price of one. Just think
about how much you're learning.

327
00:15:32,068 --> 00:15:34,168
You want me to get someone else?

328
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,798
It's a concussion.

329
00:15:38,923 --> 00:15:41,898
It isn't worse than you've seen before.
Nothing we need to go in and fix.

330
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,867
Initially we thought the injury
to your spleen would resolve itself,

331
00:15:44,992 --> 00:15:47,235
but it's bleeding too much.
Dr. Bailey needs to go in

332
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,281
- and remove it as soon as possible.
- The surgery is gonna have you out

333
00:15:50,406 --> 00:15:53,201
for a couple of weeks, but you'll
be back for next season.

334
00:15:59,949 --> 00:16:02,233
- You all right?
- I can't... breathe...

335
00:16:02,358 --> 00:16:04,588
Let's get some oxygen.
Get a crash cart.

336
00:16:11,213 --> 00:16:12,721
Let's get an EKG Just in case.

337
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,807
Have you ever had a
panic attack before?

338
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:16,975
I'm fine.

339
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,280
It's just...

340
00:16:21,108 --> 00:16:23,152
- It's nothing.
- There's daddy.

341
00:16:24,065 --> 00:16:25,984
- How's my guy?
- He's fine.

342
00:16:26,255 --> 00:16:27,405
How's my guy?

343
00:16:27,975 --> 00:16:30,145
- Well, he was...
- The brain's okay.

344
00:16:32,114 --> 00:16:34,034
But they gotta cut my belly open.

345
00:16:34,701 --> 00:16:36,411
I can't play till next season.

346
00:16:37,117 --> 00:16:38,121
Honey...

347
00:16:38,774 --> 00:16:42,261
Don't worry. Next season
will be here before you know it.

348
00:16:49,492 --> 00:16:51,480
What's the deal with you and Reed?

349
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,094
Nothing.

350
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,349
You're not trading her
surgery for sex, are you?

351
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:57,849
- Give me a break.
- Because if you are, it's gross.

352
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,352
If I sleep with her,
it's cause I want to.

353
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,765
You gonna look me in the eye and tell me
Derek never threw a craniotomy your way

354
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,772
after the two of you spend an hour
in the on-call room? Please

355
00:17:06,897 --> 00:17:10,724
I know it may not feel like it, but
you're still married, and Izzie's coming

356
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:13,971
I'm done worrying about Izzie cause
she sure as hell ain't worried about me.

357
00:17:16,649 --> 00:17:20,270
This is the old Alex...
Sleeping with some random person

358
00:17:20,395 --> 00:17:23,021
- because you're angry and hurt.
- That's what you always did.

359
00:17:23,146 --> 00:17:24,834
And then we grew up and got married.

360
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,588
It turns out your stupid post-it
is ten times the marriage

361
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,923
my church wedding ever got me.
I'm moving on.

362
00:17:36,162 --> 00:17:38,056
Tom Kates is having panic attacks?

363
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,702
I don't know why. He's not talking.
I took care of your...

364
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:43,515
- chole patient. It's all good.
- Thanks.

365
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,439
He's getting some high-class care.
Six visits with a surgeon?

366
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:50,072
- A nurse practitioner could do this.
- I like to do, aftercare myself.

367
00:17:50,197 --> 00:17:52,278
He wasn't even your patient.
He was the Chief's.

368
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:54,322
- There was an error.
- He's fine

369
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,449
- So why all...
- I have a thing for him.

370
00:18:00,003 --> 00:18:03,012
- Sheldon Morris?
- He caught my eye.

371
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:08,253
Sheldon has a quality that I'm...

372
00:18:08,637 --> 00:18:09,686
Drawn to.

373
00:18:11,705 --> 00:18:14,969
I can't put my finger
on what it is exactly.

374
00:18:15,918 --> 00:18:16,967
Sure.

375
00:18:17,531 --> 00:18:18,531
Sure.

376
00:18:19,136 --> 00:18:20,640
Want to keep his picture?

377
00:18:26,459 --> 00:18:28,523
Do you know what my sister
had for lunch today?

378
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:31,260
Pork chops.
I watched her eat.

379
00:18:31,607 --> 00:18:33,069
I didn't feel any kinship...

380
00:18:33,381 --> 00:18:34,531
With the pig.

381
00:18:35,411 --> 00:18:38,158
I think the pig valve,
may be the wrong choice.

382
00:18:39,563 --> 00:18:41,494
You feel more kinship with cows?

383
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:44,680
I don't know.

384
00:18:44,805 --> 00:18:48,037
Mrs. Carlin, we've prepared
the porcine valve replacement.

385
00:18:48,608 --> 00:18:51,231
A bovine replacement
is a whole different surgery,

386
00:18:51,356 --> 00:18:53,892
like the mechanical valve
was a whole different surgery.

387
00:18:54,017 --> 00:18:56,926
Is it possible that I could
see the valves... The pig and the cow?

388
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,637
Cause maybe then I could...
recognize one as more familiar.

389
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,371
We don't do that. We don't
march the parts around the hospital.

390
00:19:02,496 --> 00:19:04,534
Maybe we should call this off.
Can I do that?

391
00:19:04,659 --> 00:19:06,814
If you're not comfortable,
we can postpone it.

392
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:09,230
No. I mean, I can get the valves...

393
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:11,441
And I'll bring them here.

394
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:15,236
You're so wonderful.

395
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,879
- You really are. You're...
- Okay. Great.

396
00:19:20,892 --> 00:19:22,914
- She's so wonderful.
- She is.

397
00:19:28,415 --> 00:19:30,178
Tom Kates needs a splenectomy.

398
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:32,587
Any chance I can get you
to do the procedure?

399
00:19:32,823 --> 00:19:36,366
I've asked Bailey take over my service,
with the merger and all.

400
00:19:37,699 --> 00:19:41,179
It's a high-profile patient.
I thought you could make an exception.

401
00:19:43,194 --> 00:19:44,194
Sure.

402
00:19:50,342 --> 00:19:52,357
You must have extras lying around.

403
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:55,443
- We don't.
- What! You never drop one?

404
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:58,543
Open up the box and see that the pig
has a cholesterol problem?

405
00:19:59,029 --> 00:20:00,627
Let me check in the back.

406
00:20:01,723 --> 00:20:03,773
She thinks maybe one of them
will speak to her.

407
00:20:03,898 --> 00:20:04,949
It's ringing.

408
00:20:05,074 --> 00:20:07,613
I am prepping for three different
surgeries in one day,

409
00:20:07,738 --> 00:20:09,695
chasing animal parts
all over the hospital.

410
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:12,426
Teddy thinks it's hysterical,
but this may actually kill me.

411
00:20:12,551 --> 00:20:15,561
Maybe one of them will speak to her.
There are pros and cons for each.

412
00:20:15,686 --> 00:20:18,565
At the end of the day,
it's a gut thing... pig or cow?

413
00:20:18,976 --> 00:20:22,409
It's not a gut thing. It's a decision
based on fact and reason.

414
00:20:22,802 --> 00:20:25,048
- Where are my parts?
- Izzie, it's me.

415
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,904
I know you want space,
but you can't have space.

416
00:20:28,029 --> 00:20:30,279
Because Alex might be moving on.

417
00:20:30,404 --> 00:20:33,523
Come back and work in the clinic,
cause you're throwing your career away.

418
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:35,972
She got fired from surgery,
not all medicine.

419
00:20:36,097 --> 00:20:38,697
Ignore her. Just call me back.
Okay, bye.

420
00:20:41,431 --> 00:20:43,981
There. That wasn't
so difficult, was it?

421
00:20:49,556 --> 00:20:53,092
Got the first band. Let's move down
so I can take a look at the second.

422
00:20:54,026 --> 00:20:55,026
Like that?

423
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:56,713
Good.

424
00:20:57,243 --> 00:21:00,175
Why can't I grab his leg?

425
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:01,343
Problem?

426
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:03,934
No, it's just one of the bands
is holding the leg in place,

427
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:06,449
making it a little difficult
to get around.

428
00:21:06,574 --> 00:21:08,479
Can you move the ultrasound up here?

429
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,848
- Come on.
- What's the matter?

430
00:21:10,973 --> 00:21:12,808
Her uterine arteries are engorged.

431
00:21:12,933 --> 00:21:15,356
But the only way in
is in between them.

432
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,167
I'm gonna need another trocar.
You want to hold this?

433
00:21:19,292 --> 00:21:21,876
Are you sure you have enough room?
Those arteries are huge.

434
00:21:22,001 --> 00:21:24,230
That's why I'm gonna be very,
very careful. Scalpel.

435
00:21:24,355 --> 00:21:26,029
What happens if you nick them?

436
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:30,997
She could bleed out.
They both could.

437
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:34,673
- I don't like it. It's too dangerous.
- I have assessed the risk factors.

438
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:37,751
I'm 95% confident I can
get around the arteries.

439
00:21:37,876 --> 00:21:41,424
- I'm choosing to continue my surgery.
- And I don't like the other 5%.

440
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:45,094
You hit any one of those,
she bleeds out right on this table.

441
00:21:46,403 --> 00:21:48,264
You're nervous. I get that.

442
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,849
I'm a surgeon, and I'm looking
at a time bomb in a uterus.

443
00:21:50,974 --> 00:21:52,824
Shut it down. Now, Addison.

444
00:22:09,146 --> 00:22:11,599
- You good to go?
- What, are you babysitting?

445
00:22:11,724 --> 00:22:13,853
- cause I'm new at this.
- Where's the Chief?

446
00:22:13,978 --> 00:22:16,976
- I don't know. Check his office.
- He said he was gonna do the surgery.

447
00:22:17,101 --> 00:22:20,463
And then he told me he didn't have time
and asked me if I would do it,

448
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:23,508
which I was planning on doing in
the first place, so I said yes.

449
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:26,636
He said something about
a budget meeting. I think he's swamped.

450
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:29,847
If he's got time to watch old surgical
films with you, he's not swamped.

451
00:22:30,454 --> 00:22:31,808
What the hell is going on?

452
00:22:32,121 --> 00:22:34,321
The chole patient, your boyfriend?

453
00:22:34,446 --> 00:22:37,410
That was the Chief's mistake. And
he hasn't touched a patient since then.

454
00:22:37,535 --> 00:22:40,188
- He's been busy with the merger.
- I've heard that story before.

455
00:22:40,313 --> 00:22:41,663
What is going on?

456
00:22:46,786 --> 00:22:49,786
It is not my job to get
involved in his personal life

457
00:22:49,911 --> 00:22:52,161
just like it's not your job
to get involved in mine.

458
00:22:57,803 --> 00:22:58,803
10-blade.

459
00:23:00,243 --> 00:23:02,951
I made a judgment call.
You didn't like it.

460
00:23:03,076 --> 00:23:04,078
I'm sorry.

461
00:23:04,203 --> 00:23:06,733
You threw me on a plane in
the middle of my morning coffee

462
00:23:06,858 --> 00:23:09,512
- because you wanted my judgment.
- It was risky.

463
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,495
That is not your call to make
in my OR

464
00:23:12,733 --> 00:23:14,363
You acted like a father.

465
00:23:14,488 --> 00:23:16,603
Why do you think we don't let parents
in the room

466
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:19,022
- during an operation?
- I'm not her father, Addison.

467
00:23:19,285 --> 00:23:21,184
Biologically, yes, but...

468
00:23:21,793 --> 00:23:23,985
I just met the kid.
I'm helping out.

469
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:26,061
You reacted like a parent.

470
00:23:26,186 --> 00:23:28,970
Now I don't know when,
I don't know how,

471
00:23:29,095 --> 00:23:32,320
but at some point, you became
a dad to that little urchin,

472
00:23:32,445 --> 00:23:36,449
because you just lost it in my OR,
and Mark Sloan never loses it in the OR

473
00:23:37,176 --> 00:23:38,176
Not ever.

474
00:23:40,193 --> 00:23:42,888
Yes, it was risky, and, yes,
most surgeons would've jumped ship

475
00:23:43,013 --> 00:23:46,075
at the sight of the engorged arteries.
But I am not most surgeons,

476
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,865
and neither are you.

477
00:23:51,153 --> 00:23:52,853
We can try this again...

478
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:55,341
With you in the waiting room.

479
00:23:57,056 --> 00:23:59,256
It's too risky.
She's just a kid.

480
00:24:01,489 --> 00:24:04,817
Have Morrison monitor the bands
as the baby grows. It might be okay.

481
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,380
I gotta go.
Patients at home.

482
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,550
Congratulations.

483
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:14,510
You're a parent.

484
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:34,472
Neither one is speaking to me.

485
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,182
Are they speaking to you?

486
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:39,545
If I put your own valve in front of you,
it wouldn't speak to you either.

487
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:42,184
I have a cousin.
His wife is a cardiologist.

488
00:24:42,309 --> 00:24:43,731
I should call her.

489
00:24:43,966 --> 00:24:46,818
No more calls. This is about
you and your heart.

490
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:49,529
And you need to use your
instinct and make a decision.

491
00:24:49,901 --> 00:24:51,322
Right now... Pig or cow?

492
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,010
- But I...
- Pig or cow?

493
00:24:53,135 --> 00:24:55,449
Pig or cow? Don't think.
Just... pig or cow? Go.

494
00:24:55,574 --> 00:24:57,954
- Now! Now!
- Pig. No. Cow.

495
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:01,332
Pig! Pig! Pig. Pig.

496
00:25:05,062 --> 00:25:06,062
Pig.

497
00:25:08,499 --> 00:25:11,900
The procedure went well. You're gonna
be back on your feet in no time.

498
00:25:12,171 --> 00:25:13,171
Great.

499
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,100
Great.

500
00:25:18,136 --> 00:25:19,600
You're scared to play.

501
00:25:20,721 --> 00:25:22,521
You thought you were done.

502
00:25:23,245 --> 00:25:26,212
And when I said you'd be
back in the game next season,

503
00:25:26,802 --> 00:25:27,952
you panicked.

504
00:25:32,389 --> 00:25:34,939
I used to be able
to block out the fear.

505
00:25:35,854 --> 00:25:37,410
But ever since Des was born,

506
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:40,428
I'm on that field,
and my heart starts racing,

507
00:25:40,553 --> 00:25:42,417
and I can't catch my breath.

508
00:25:42,818 --> 00:25:45,172
I look at guys who played
their whole careers.

509
00:25:45,874 --> 00:25:49,235
They're hit so many times, they can
barely remember their own names.

510
00:25:51,535 --> 00:25:54,485
And I'm scared he's gonna
grow up without a dad.

511
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:57,430
I'm scared all the time.

512
00:25:57,771 --> 00:26:00,683
It's a natural reaction.
You're a father.

513
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:05,202
Why don't you retire?

514
00:26:05,327 --> 00:26:07,563
Two years into a pro career?

515
00:26:08,273 --> 00:26:09,484
I mean, I can't.

516
00:26:09,739 --> 00:26:12,945
I know I'm not a soldier in Iraq
or a rocket scientist

517
00:26:13,274 --> 00:26:14,947
or any kind of real hero.

518
00:26:15,564 --> 00:26:18,473
I know I'm just some big, dumb jock.

519
00:26:19,408 --> 00:26:22,672
But I'm a big, dumb jock
the entire city...

520
00:26:22,797 --> 00:26:23,873
Roots for.

521
00:26:24,509 --> 00:26:27,426
Kids, guys on the street...

522
00:26:28,289 --> 00:26:29,889
I can't let them down.

523
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:32,555
This is the trade off.

524
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,220
I get hit.

525
00:26:34,879 --> 00:26:37,803
Some guys can't even
feed their families, you know?

526
00:26:38,607 --> 00:26:41,408
And some guys are soldiers in Iraq,

527
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:43,560
and they get shot at.

528
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,430
So I'm not complaining.

529
00:26:46,702 --> 00:26:47,813
I'm just...

530
00:26:48,979 --> 00:26:50,629
I'm scared of the hits.

531
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:56,977
I want to be able to remember
who my kid is.

532
00:27:05,702 --> 00:27:07,166
No more bubbles.

533
00:27:07,449 --> 00:27:09,210
Pressures are good.
Let's come off.

534
00:27:10,098 --> 00:27:11,298
Decannulating.

535
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:15,508
I told Torres she had to let you
scrub in if she was cutting.

536
00:27:15,935 --> 00:27:16,935
Cool.

537
00:27:17,485 --> 00:27:19,035
Book an on-call room.

538
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:22,261
What happened to drinks first?

539
00:27:22,386 --> 00:27:25,393
It's kind of a waste of time, right?
Cut to the chase.

540
00:27:30,072 --> 00:27:31,654
Do you know Izzie Stevens?

541
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:34,652
I met before she got fired.

542
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,320
You know she's Alex's wife.

543
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,448
And she's not here right now,
but they're still married.

544
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:40,791
Meredith, shut up.

545
00:27:40,916 --> 00:27:44,036
No. Some people think
you're divorced, and you're not.

546
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:47,331
How about you just shut up long enough
to watch your friend tank her valve?

547
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,595
How what?

548
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,447
- She's tachycardic.
- Suction.

549
00:27:50,572 --> 00:27:52,753
Take this.
Laps. I need more laps.

550
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,816
Someone get me
a sponge stick, please.

551
00:27:57,426 --> 00:28:00,886
I'm having difficulty
locating the bleeder.

552
00:28:01,306 --> 00:28:02,888
- Dr. Altman?
- Keep looking.

553
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:04,390
BP's dropping.

554
00:28:04,954 --> 00:28:07,602
How come Altman's
not doing anything?

555
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:09,948
Suction. More suction

556
00:28:17,115 --> 00:28:18,665
Knee looks like crap.

557
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:21,361
But that's been true for a long time.
He should be able to play

558
00:28:21,486 --> 00:28:23,784
- through the pain.
- What if he can't?

559
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,579
What about a knee replacement,
right now?

560
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:29,682
He needs to stop.

561
00:28:29,807 --> 00:28:32,457
How about we make it
so it's not his idea?

562
00:28:34,883 --> 00:28:36,172
Systolic's down to 80.

563
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,922
I could suture directly or clamp.
I don't know which one to do.

564
00:28:39,047 --> 00:28:40,199
I don't know either.

565
00:28:40,324 --> 00:28:43,217
My guess is, is if you came and
looked at it, you'd have a better idea.

566
00:28:43,342 --> 00:28:45,640
I'm sure that's true,
but I'm not the one operating.

567
00:28:45,808 --> 00:28:47,733
- This is a lot of blood.
- She's crashing!

568
00:28:47,858 --> 00:28:51,062
You're over thinking it. Look at
the aorta. What does it tell you?

569
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:53,547
That I have two options,
I don't know which one to do.

570
00:28:53,672 --> 00:28:55,569
This is crazy.
Why isn't she helping her?

571
00:28:55,694 --> 00:28:58,069
- How's it going?
- Yang's killing her patient,

572
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:00,821
And Altman's reading
"the atlantic monthly."

573
00:29:02,614 --> 00:29:04,241
If I suture, it might not hold,

574
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,702
- if I clamp, it could rupture.
- Her BP's tanking.

575
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,366
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm teaching, and she's learning.

576
00:29:10,491 --> 00:29:12,682
She needs help.
She may be too proud to say it,

577
00:29:12,807 --> 00:29:15,710
but how about we don't let this patient
die and give her a hand anyhow?

578
00:29:15,835 --> 00:29:18,130
She asked. She's not that proud.
And I said no.

579
00:29:18,488 --> 00:29:21,759
This patient is not going to die.
She is going to save the patient.

580
00:29:21,884 --> 00:29:22,885
Pig or cow?

581
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:25,401
You're sitting on your hands
cause you're angry with me.

582
00:29:25,526 --> 00:29:27,936
- If that patient...
- You are blowing my concentration.

583
00:29:28,061 --> 00:29:29,350
Now get out of my OR

584
00:29:31,486 --> 00:29:33,896
Pig or cow? Pig or cow?
Pig or cow? Pig or cow?

585
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:35,814
Pig. Clamp. 3-od pledget.

586
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:41,572
Dr. Torres and I think
your knee needs replacing.

587
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:43,656
That's been true since college.

588
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:47,743
There's just too much degeneration.
The joint is completely shot.

589
00:29:48,805 --> 00:29:51,580
You need a unicondylar repair,
or you may lose the ability to walk.

590
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:54,333
But a knee replacement
will take me out of the game forever.

591
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:56,679
Exactly.

592
00:30:05,902 --> 00:30:07,012
It's coming up.

593
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:09,348
Look right there.

594
00:30:10,532 --> 00:30:11,682
Look at that.

595
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:15,354
That's the minute we knew
your mother was different.

596
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:17,941
And that other hand holding
the retractor? That's Garber.

597
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:20,140
He was the Chief of surgery
back then.

598
00:30:21,823 --> 00:30:23,119
No one could believe it.

599
00:30:23,829 --> 00:30:26,029
She walked in that room a resident

600
00:30:26,916 --> 00:30:28,616
and walked out a legend.

601
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,608
Derek was worried
when you didn't show up

602
00:30:38,733 --> 00:30:40,691
for the Tom Kates surgery.

603
00:30:41,323 --> 00:30:43,314
Derek worries.
That makes him a good guy.

604
00:30:43,439 --> 00:30:44,592
Look, look.

605
00:30:48,734 --> 00:30:52,475
If Dr. Montgomery had hit it
during the procedure...

606
00:30:54,161 --> 00:30:55,394
It's dangerous.

607
00:30:55,894 --> 00:30:58,516
What about that band
that's squeezing his thigh?

608
00:30:58,641 --> 00:31:00,232
He's not even gonna have a knee?

609
00:31:00,566 --> 00:31:02,985
- You coulda died.
- I can't have a gimpy kid.

610
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:05,314
Honey, I know I haven't been
your father for long,

611
00:31:05,439 --> 00:31:08,115
but if you say "gimp" one more
time, I'm gonna smack you.

612
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,429
You don't get it.

613
00:31:09,554 --> 00:31:11,192
He needs legs.

614
00:31:12,082 --> 00:31:15,427
He doesn't have a dad,
and he's got a stupid, slutty mom.

615
00:31:15,552 --> 00:31:16,950
Don't you see?

616
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:19,877
I've already hurt him enough
by giving him me as a mother.

617
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:21,245
He needs feet.

618
00:31:21,955 --> 00:31:24,050
I don't know how
to take care of any baby.

619
00:31:24,175 --> 00:31:26,509
I can't have one that's hurt.
I just can't handle it.

620
00:31:26,914 --> 00:31:30,679
My mom doesn't even talk to me.
I'm doing this alone.

621
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,060
Please.

622
00:31:33,426 --> 00:31:34,433
Listen...

623
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,310
You're not stupid.

624
00:31:37,632 --> 00:31:39,232
And you're not slutty.

625
00:31:40,405 --> 00:31:41,555
The Sloans...

626
00:31:43,389 --> 00:31:44,389
Are a...

627
00:31:45,213 --> 00:31:47,308
Passionate people.

628
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,690
You dragged yourself
across the country

629
00:31:49,815 --> 00:31:52,704
so that you could get help
taking care of this baby.

630
00:31:52,829 --> 00:31:54,495
That's not being stupid.

631
00:31:55,161 --> 00:31:56,611
That's being a mom.

632
00:31:57,165 --> 00:32:00,768
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you or the baby.

633
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:04,129
Go to L.A.

634
00:32:05,787 --> 00:32:08,682
Addison said 95%.
That's not that bad.

635
00:32:08,807 --> 00:32:10,219
Let her do the surgery.

636
00:32:14,546 --> 00:32:16,475
Looks like we're going to L.A.

637
00:32:19,776 --> 00:32:21,522
you're not gonna do this alone.

638
00:32:25,805 --> 00:32:26,819
Stay.

639
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:28,487
After the baby's born,

640
00:32:28,894 --> 00:32:31,198
live with me and Lexie.
Raise the baby with us.

641
00:32:31,981 --> 00:32:33,602
I don't know anything about

642
00:32:33,856 --> 00:32:37,156
being a dad. You don't know anything
about being a mom.

643
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,389
Maybe we could...

644
00:32:40,562 --> 00:32:42,412
Figure it all out together.

645
00:32:43,249 --> 00:32:44,253
Really?

646
00:32:46,705 --> 00:32:47,705
Okay.

647
00:32:57,848 --> 00:32:59,048
Drill, please.

648
00:33:00,441 --> 00:33:03,291
Are you sure there's nothing
I can do to help?

649
00:33:03,575 --> 00:33:05,858
So I'm not gonna get to do
anything in this surgery.

650
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:08,776
- Not worth what you paid for it?
- Shut up.

651
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:12,339
You guys are all worked up about
how none of you get to operate anymore.

652
00:33:12,464 --> 00:33:14,425
But you know what? At some point

653
00:33:14,737 --> 00:33:17,507
you'll log enough hours with a scalpel.
At some point,

654
00:33:17,632 --> 00:33:18,912
you'll be surgeons.

655
00:33:19,252 --> 00:33:20,452
And one day...

656
00:33:21,197 --> 00:33:22,787
You'll look up and realize,

657
00:33:23,574 --> 00:33:26,174
"There's more
in the world than cutting."

658
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,405
Tom Kates' career is ending.

659
00:33:28,898 --> 00:33:30,841
That is what's happening
in this room.

660
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:34,165
So could you for one second think about
something other than yourselves?

661
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:35,290
Bone saw.

662
00:33:35,586 --> 00:33:39,119
I can't believe I'm taking out the best
quarterback Seattle's ever seen.

663
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:40,500
You're not.

664
00:33:42,182 --> 00:33:44,682
He was out of the game
a long time ago.

665
00:33:54,674 --> 00:33:57,743
I would have stepped in. I would not
have let that patient get hurt.

666
00:33:57,911 --> 00:33:59,820
- I know that.
- She needs to be pushed.

667
00:33:59,945 --> 00:34:01,970
She's like a racehorse.
You need to push her,

668
00:34:02,095 --> 00:34:04,201
- otherwise she's gonna lose her mind.
- I know.

669
00:34:06,908 --> 00:34:09,558
So nothing else
was going on in that room?

670
00:34:31,266 --> 00:34:32,586
You ready to pay up?

671
00:34:32,711 --> 00:34:35,001
That was the lamest
assist in history.

672
00:34:35,126 --> 00:34:36,613
It's hardly worth...

673
00:34:36,738 --> 00:34:38,038
A deal's a deal.

674
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:43,856
There might have been a little
misunderstanding about what

675
00:34:44,404 --> 00:34:45,958
"you know" means.

676
00:34:48,184 --> 00:34:50,731
I don't trade surgery for sex.

677
00:34:52,213 --> 00:34:53,613
If you want sex...

678
00:34:54,112 --> 00:34:55,162
Ask for it.

679
00:34:56,928 --> 00:35:00,222
If you want surgery, go kiss
an attending's ass, not mine.

680
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:07,003
This is illegal and immoral and...

681
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:10,044
And you two should be
ashamed of yourselves.

682
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:12,076
Go to hell.

683
00:35:16,636 --> 00:35:18,436
How am I the bad guy here?

684
00:35:22,493 --> 00:35:24,393
I should've asked you first,

685
00:35:24,518 --> 00:35:26,999
but I was so excited.

686
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:29,168
And I was so sure
it was the right thing.

687
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,670
And you know why?
Cause of you.

688
00:35:32,726 --> 00:35:35,924
Since you, I know,
for the first time in my life,

689
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,372
what the right thing is.

690
00:35:37,497 --> 00:35:40,065
I am happy for you.
I really am.

691
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,540
Something happened today.

692
00:35:43,067 --> 00:35:44,904
You became a dad, a real one.

693
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:48,616
And Sloan, against all odds,
became a mom.

694
00:35:50,067 --> 00:35:51,217
But I didn't.

695
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,798
I was barely ready
to move in with you,

696
00:35:54,923 --> 00:35:57,846
never mind your daughter
and a grand-baby.

697
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:00,200
I don't want this.

698
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:02,492
You wanted to give
your liver to your dad.

699
00:36:02,769 --> 00:36:04,583
This is what you do
for family, right?

700
00:36:04,708 --> 00:36:06,875
I understand why you're doing it.

701
00:36:07,477 --> 00:36:09,541
I just don't understand
why I'm doing it.

702
00:36:11,158 --> 00:36:12,795
I think you're doing it for me.

703
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:14,909
Don't make me out
to be the selfish one.

704
00:36:15,034 --> 00:36:18,807
You don't get to unilaterally decide
to let a teenager and her infant

705
00:36:18,932 --> 00:36:20,135
move into our house.

706
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,760
We'll get a bigger place.
She needs us.

707
00:36:26,456 --> 00:36:28,156
I thought I missed this.

708
00:36:29,728 --> 00:36:31,428
This is a chance for me.

709
00:36:32,282 --> 00:36:34,882
Don't make me choose
between you and her.

710
00:36:37,005 --> 00:36:38,005
Why?

711
00:36:38,425 --> 00:36:39,905
Cause you'll choose her?

712
00:36:46,474 --> 00:36:47,774
I'll choose her.

713
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,175
I think our relationship just ended.

714
00:37:16,122 --> 00:37:19,027
Something is going on with the Chief,
and I can't figure it out.

715
00:37:21,889 --> 00:37:23,939
I think he's scared to operate.

716
00:37:24,407 --> 00:37:25,757
Is that possible?

717
00:37:28,438 --> 00:37:31,134
You don't know
or you're not gonna tell me?

718
00:37:40,952 --> 00:37:43,349
Did you see that?
I'm holding the heart,

719
00:37:43,474 --> 00:37:46,554
I feel it almost starting
to fibrillate in my hand...

720
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:50,129
Piss-poor aortic tissue,
possibly irreparable, and then...

721
00:37:50,779 --> 00:37:52,644
Sutures hold and it comes back.

722
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,594
I know. I don't want
to see the face.

723
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:56,645
I don't want to hear
what you have to say.

724
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:58,984
- I was fine. I was on fire.
- I know that.

725
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:02,782
I was learning. I felt alive for the
first time in I don't know how long.

726
00:38:02,907 --> 00:38:06,757
- It was like I had air in my lungs...
- She's leaving... Seattle.

727
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:25,886
When I lost my nerve,
the Chief helped me.

728
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:32,462
It's... Nothing.

729
00:38:32,587 --> 00:38:35,354
If it's nothing, find a way
to look me in the eye.

730
00:38:43,556 --> 00:38:45,401
What are you doing in here?

731
00:38:45,526 --> 00:38:46,526
Moving in.

732
00:38:47,587 --> 00:38:50,702
I'm sick of living in that damn trailer.
Go live in Izzie's old room.

733
00:38:52,076 --> 00:38:53,747
You go. She's your wife.

734
00:38:56,728 --> 00:38:59,878
I thought you were shacking up
with what's his face.

735
00:39:01,355 --> 00:39:02,355
I'm not.

736
00:39:02,972 --> 00:39:06,976
The post-it didn't say anything about
lying cause I didn't think it needed it.

737
00:39:07,413 --> 00:39:08,613
I'm not lying.

738
00:39:09,226 --> 00:39:12,045
You don't need to know every thought
in my head. I have relationships

739
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:14,970
- that don't involve...
- What are you doing?

740
00:39:15,601 --> 00:39:17,771
I'm too young to be a grandmother.

741
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:23,777
I'm still supposed to be
working like a dog

742
00:39:23,902 --> 00:39:27,625
and... then come home
and do stupid things, like

743
00:39:28,281 --> 00:39:30,906
bungee jumping and jell-o shots.

744
00:39:31,649 --> 00:39:32,999
I don't even know

745
00:39:33,489 --> 00:39:35,689
what people my own age do anymore.

746
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,510
I know something stupid you can do.

747
00:39:58,043 --> 00:40:01,000
<i>You never forget the moment
you become a doctor.</i>

748
00:40:07,537 --> 00:40:08,687
I don't know.

749
00:40:10,863 --> 00:40:12,727
I keep telling myself
there's no problem,

750
00:40:12,852 --> 00:40:15,370
but if there's no problem,
then why can't I just say it?

751
00:40:17,277 --> 00:40:18,627
<i>A switch flips...</i>

752
00:40:21,151 --> 00:40:23,951
<i>Suddenly you're not playing
dress up anymore.</i>

753
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:27,444
<i>You own the white coat.</i>

754
00:40:32,802 --> 00:40:34,452
Dr. Altman, wait. Wait.

755
00:40:35,251 --> 00:40:37,196
What do you want? More money?

756
00:40:37,321 --> 00:40:40,473
Cause I'll talk to the Chief. They can
set up a new cardio unit with a...

757
00:40:40,598 --> 00:40:42,899
With a research lab or...
or you can work with v...

758
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:44,220
It isn't about that.

759
00:40:44,345 --> 00:40:47,370
No one has ever
believed in me like this.

760
00:40:47,495 --> 00:40:49,652
You believe in me more than I do,
and I need that.

761
00:40:49,777 --> 00:40:53,075
- I'm gonna die here without that.
- It's so complicated. I can't...

762
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:55,362
Tell me what you want,
and I will make it happen.

763
00:40:55,487 --> 00:40:57,815
- I want Owen.
- Fine! Done! Take him.

764
00:40:59,467 --> 00:41:01,112
<i>What you may not notice</i>

765
00:41:01,237 --> 00:41:03,537
<i>is the moment that being a doctor...</i>

766
00:41:05,245 --> 00:41:06,296
<i>Changes you.</i>

767
00:41:09,807 --> 00:41:11,301
He's drinking again.

768
