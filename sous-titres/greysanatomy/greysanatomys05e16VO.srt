1
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,910
<i>There's this thing that happens
when people find out  you're a doctor.</i>

2
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,600
Good morning.

3
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,210
Did... you... patter?

4
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:28,890
Propose?

5
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,890
No, not yet.

6
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:32,860
You'll be the first to know.

7
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:37,460
<i>They stop seeing you as a person  and begin
to see you  as something  bigger than you are.</i>

8
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,400
How's she doing?

9
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,940
She's, uh... okay.

10
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,530
She's okay.

11
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,130
<i>They have to see us that way, as gods.</i>

12
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:53,170
<i>Otherwise we're just like  everyone
else--  unsure... flawed... normal.</i>

13
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:56,880
How's she doing?

14
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,690
- There's no change. Is this the M.C.A. Doppler?
- Yeah.

15
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:00,640
Can I get you anything, coffee?

16
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,920
I'm fine. I'm fine. Thanks.

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,370
<i>So we act strong, we remain stoic.</i>

18
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,900
<i>We hide the fact that
we're all too human.</i>

19
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,430
He still beating himself up?

20
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,800
Addison thinks he's
still beating himself up.

21
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,210
Alex...

22
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,430
the head of neuro hasn't left his
patient's bedside for three days.

23
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,800
He's fine. And I thought
addison was leaving.

24
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,380
She put her brother
on a plane last night.

25
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,570
Admit it.

26
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,610
Her hanging around your guy... it bugs.

27
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,140
It doesn't bug. You bug.

28
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:34,320
Karev. Page Addison. Tell
her I need her to stay.

29
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,590
Okay. It bugs a little.

30
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,740
The lack of blood flow through the vessel
is causing the mini-strokes and aphasia.

31
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,370
We can't put surgery off any longer,

32
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:46,640
so what I'm gonna do is a repair
that's called an E.C./I.C. Bypass.

33
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,750
And--and that will fix the
strokes? She'll be better after this?

34
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,480
I'm hoping it will work, yes.

35
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,160
but... the...

36
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,400
I'm sure they wouldn't operate unless it
were safe for the baby, right, Dr. Montgomery?

37
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,800
Oh,your--your blood pressure is still high, but that's
why I'll be there, to monitor both you and the baby.

38
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,910
Get some rest. We'll see you soon.

39
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:06,840
Thank you for staying.

40
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,660
It's the least I could do
for saving Archie.

41
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:15,640
I know we said before,about the
baby, but if something should happen,

42
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,900
if it comes down to
a choice, save my wife.

43
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,130
We can make another baby. We
can't make another her.

44
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,760
52-year-old male, fell
down a flight of stairs.

45
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,630
He's five days post-op from a
cholecystectomy, which looks to have caused the fall.

46
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,270
Why would having your gall
bladder removed cause a fall?

47
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,110
Well...

48
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,770
a non-laparoscopic choli?

49
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,980
Sir, what hospital did you
have your operation at?

50
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,420
Here.

51
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,660
Uh, my surgeon was Dr. Campbell.

52
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,020
That explains it.

53
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,450
- Excuse us for a moment.
- Okay.

54
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,900
All right,what?

55
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:02,810
Campbell was Seattle grace's first
female surgeon, as pioneer as it gets.

56
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:06,050
Mostly she just sits in her
office and spreads prestige around.

57
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:09,330
She...  still does routine
surgery now and then.

58
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,190
You mean botches routine surgery.

59
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:11,940
I'll page the chief.

60
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,070
No, page Campbell. It's her patient.

61
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,210
And let her maim the guy again?

62
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:19,740
How about we page someone who actually
knows how to operate instead of some dinosaur

63
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:23,810
who refuses to retire her scalpel
and go join her friends in Boca?

64
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,620
The dinosaur is here.

65
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,750
No need to page me.

66
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,890
So, did you scope her out yet?

67
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,810
- Who?
- Arizona.

68
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:42,970
Oh, right, that. No, I haven't had a chance to swing
by peds and ask the nurse to point out the attending

69
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,750
who kissed my friend
in a dirty bar bathroom.

70
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,580
Well, at least you're
still good for coffee.

71
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,180
Oh, that's not for you.

72
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,460
Coffee? Why, thank you, Mark.

73
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,120
Well, it's, uh, that's not for you, either.

74
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,290
Morning, Dr. Grey.

75
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,540
Yeah,y ou can keep your secret coffee.

76
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:03,640
Until you tell Derek, our relationship is gonna
continue to consist of you hiding in the attic

77
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,710
and me smuggling
snacks past mer's bedroom.

78
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:06,970
Do you know what that makes you?

79
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,100
- Your boyfriend?
- Yeah. Anne frank.

80
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,540
I am dating anne frank.

81
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,910
And I'm tired of it.

82
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,440
I-I want to go downstairs with you.

83
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,070
I want to tell the
Germans to kiss my ass.

84
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,550
I'm gonna tell him soon.

85
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,560
And when I do, you'll be
my date to the wedding.

86
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,440
- Derek proposed?
- Well, not yet, but when he does.

87
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,360
This application is the first
step in the start of a new life.

88
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,710
How are we feelin'?

89
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:32,870
Positive? Confident?

90
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,130
I am good. Great.

91
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,770
Uh, you take care of your own feelings.

92
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,450
Peds surgery is super competitive.

93
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:42,720
That's why I've come armed with letters of
recommendation that'll put the competition to shame.

94
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,470
Look, Shepherd says I'm
talented and resourceful,

95
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:48,070
sloan finds it an honor to
work with me every day, and I--

96
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,670
what about the chief? What'd
the chief think?

97
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,940
I'm still working on that.

98
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,130
Bailey, the chief's is the only
recommendation that matters.

99
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,920
Everyone on the selection
committee works for him.

100
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,840
I know. You calm down.

101
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,230
I've got it under control.

102
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:04,070
Good, 'cause speaking on behalf of me,we
couldn't be more excited to have you.

103
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,070
Yay!

104
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,810
Ch--uh, chief. Just
a friendly nudge.

105
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,540
Your letter of recommendation
is due by the end of the day.

106
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,780
I'll remind patricia.

107
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,670
- You have written it?
- You'll get your letter of recommendation.

108
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,770
- I need more time.
- No.

109
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:24,350
Don't get me wrong,I am honored that you
asked me over all the other residents,

110
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:28,590
But, you know, it's not easy distilling a doctor
of your stature down to 500 words or less.

111
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,080
I chose you, O'Malley, because you were the only one I
could trust to do this without screwing it up, so don't.

112
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,180
Make he sure he planes the patio.

113
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:43,590
- Plates the...
- We'll get him piano lessons, yes.

114
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:48,880
Only puddle shell...
uh... only public sc--

115
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,150
public school, so he doesn't
become a snob, I know.

116
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,880
But I don't have to,because you're gonna be
there to make sure I don't turn him into a jerk.

117
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,390
We're here.

118
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:06,130
- I love just...
- I know. You love me.

119
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,600
and I love you.

120
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,250
I'll see you in a few.

121
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,040
Thank you.

122
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,740
Hey, her blood pressure's up a
little higher than it was yesterday.

123
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,300
We can't wait.

124
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,090
- Well, I know,but I just-- you
want me to be aware. I understand.

125
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,560
You're a good doctor. So am I.

126
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,570
Let's just be good together.

127
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,470
Your guy and my guy work well together.

128
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,610
Well, my guy works well with everyone.

129
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,800
- Dr. Stevens.
- Yes.

130
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,370
Do you think we'll get to
scrub in on a surgery today?

131
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,870
You losers really think you're capable
of holding someone's life in your hands

132
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,930
When you could barely
finish the intern bowl?

133
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,220
Really? Come on.

134
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,520
- Sr. Stevens.
- Yes.

135
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,160
Remember me?

136
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,130
I was here a couple of days ago,and
you told me I might have cancer.

137
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:53,890
Yeah,and you sent me to an oncologist
who sent me to an immunologist

138
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:58,810
who then sent me to some other kind of "ologist" that i had
never even heard of before I set foot in this death trap.

139
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:05,720
And $80,000 in medical tests later,the
only thing wrong with me is that I'm anemic.

140
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:13,340
my lawyer seems to think that someone here
mislabel the blood, switched it with someone else's.

141
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,830
And I was told not to come here, but
my conscience wanted to make sure

142
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:21,270
that you went through those files of
everybody who was here at the clinic that day.

143
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,470
Of course.

144
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,730
Of course we will. I'm so sorry.

145
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:26,120
Well, don't apologize to me.

146
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,770
I'm just anemic.

147
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,460
You apologize to that dying person.

148
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,490
Is that the middle cerebral artery?

149
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:10,940
Yes, after I connect the
S.T.A., We will be able to close.

150
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,600
The baby's having spontaneous decels.

151
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,880
Mom's hypotensive.

152
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,190
Derek, I don't know how
much more they can handle.

153
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,570
The M.C.A. Is bleeding a bit.

154
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:17,560
It shouldn't be
contributing. Sutures please.

155
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,850
Pressure's dropping.

156
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:20,940
Derek, the baby's gonna need to come out.

157
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,910
I'm almost done, addison. Just wait.

158
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,300
It's not me that can't wait.

159
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,860
The decels are getting more frequent.

160
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,420
A 24-week-old fetus can't handle
this-- three surgeries in four days.

161
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,100
We have to get the baby out, Derek.

162
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,300
The baby is too young to come out.

163
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,090
Last decel lasted a full 30 seconds.

164
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,460
Allright, that's it. Karev, let's go.

165
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,580
I'm taking him out.

166
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,500
- Cut the
suture.- 10-blade.

167
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,560
Leave the baby in.

168
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:46,330
Done. I'm done.

169
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,390
I'm done.

170
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,390
You've got a minor fracture,so
you won't need surgery.

171
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,860
You should be on your
feet within a few weeks.

172
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,180
I don't know what I was thinking.

173
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,640
I knew the wound wasn't healing
as fast as I had hoped,but--

174
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,620
Next time, you call me, John.

175
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:11,860
Dr. Yang... explain to my patient what you feel I should've
done differently in order to avoid this complication.

176
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:15,250
Now don't be shy, Dr. Yang.

177
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,370
Okay.

178
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:20,630
Well, patient's status post minimally invasive procedures

179
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:23,870
have been shown to have decreased
post-surgical discomfort and recovery times.

180
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:28,800
In human, please, Dr. Yang.

181
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,940
This surgery should've
been done laparscopically.

182
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:39,260
Dr. Hunt... perhaps you can explain to dr.
Yang why I chose to do the surgery this way?

183
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:42,530
Although some doctors prefer
to the new technology,

184
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:46,300
there are others who believe it's
actually more risky since we can't see

185
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,720
or move around as much
during the surgery.

186
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,230
It's half a dozen either way.

187
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,220
Bravo, Dr. Hunt.

188
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,320
Do you understand, John?

189
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,400
Yes.

190
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,240
I have no doubt you did the
right thing by me, Dr. Campbell.

191
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,550
Wonderful!

192
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:08,110
Now, Dr. Yang... please
take our patient to C.T.--

193
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:11,440
Maybe you'll learn
something in the process--

194
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,670
while I confer with dr. Hunt
about, uh, our course of treatment.

195
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:21,800
I'm on a deadline, Stevens.

196
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,890
Sadie harris mislabeled a patient's blood
sample,and now the clinic is probably getting sued.

197
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,740
It's a good thing sadie harris
no longer works here then.

198
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,650
No, it's not. It's not a good
thing because it isn't just her.

199
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:33,770
The interns, all of them, they are
capable of the same mistake.

200
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,790
- They are dangerous and
they are bad.- Stevens--

201
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:40,680
Don't tell me I am overly emotional and that
it isn't personal,because it is personal.

202
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:45,340
I have worked so hard to teach
them, and... and it is personal.

203
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:50,090
Stevens, you don't think I thought the same thing about
you people every day for the first year you worked here?

204
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:52,480
You know what the chief
told me when I did?

205
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,060
Get out.

206
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:02,560
You don't get much
rest, do you,Ddr. Shephard?

207
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:08,660
Did you hear yourself just then?

208
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:11,110
Oh, my god. Oh,my god.

209
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,830
I can-- I
can talk.

210
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,330
I know! Listen to you.

211
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:20,950
And the baby?

212
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,180
How is the baby?

213
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:27,250
The, uh, baby's stable, however, um,your
new labs show that you're preeclamptic.

214
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,630
Now we had hoped to keep it
from progressing to this stage,

215
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:32,960
but the stress of the surgery, it
was a lot on your body.

216
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,430
So do we--do we
need to be worried?

217
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,050
Come on, Dr. Shephard.

218
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,210
Please tell me we're done being worried.

219
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:46,010
That is the first moment of
hope they've had in a week.

220
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:48,330
Preeclampsia is
serious. They needed to know.

221
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,060
You are too close to this patient.

222
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,980
Stop fighting me on this.We had a victory
in there. Let's stay focused on that.

223
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,970
We give the family
all of the information.

224
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:57,180
That's our job, Derek.

225
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,490
Looks like my guy won that round.

226
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:04,810
Meredith--uh, Karev, can you go
get, uh, Jen's, uh, blood test results?

227
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,110
Give me one reason why I
shouldn't go to the chief.

228
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,790
Why? The surgery was a success.

229
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:13,700
He made a mistake in her first surgery, he caused
a series of complications, he feels responsible.

230
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,160
So tell me why I should worry less.

231
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,610
Tell me why I shouldn't go to the chief.

232
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:21,250
During the clinical trial, he lost a lot of
patients,and it affected him, for the better I think.

233
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,230
He cares more, if that's possible.

234
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:26,600
You just have to trust him.

235
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,780
Okay.

236
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,480
Calliope.

237
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,700
I haven't seen you around.

238
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,000
Yeah, well, I've been avoiding you.

239
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,840
I know. It's--it's
so weird.

240
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:51,330
You share a kiss with a woman you've never
seen before... honestly, this is a new adventure.

241
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:55,680
One I'm so ready to take for
the second time and... anyway...

242
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,880
do you want to go on a date with me?

243
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:03,790
Wait. Uh, Erica and you--
she was your first?

244
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,600
Yeah.

245
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,370
Okay, so then I guess my answer is... no.

246
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:12,480
- I'm sorry.
- Wait. Wait, wait.

247
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,070
What? Uh... um... you kissed me...

248
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:20,430
out of nowhere,in a bathroom.

249
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,350
Okay, see, this is what I try to avoid.

250
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:28,500
You're all exploring and
experimenting and... Yay!

251
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,620
This is a really exciting time for you.

252
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,210
But I work in peds.

253
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:35,270
I spend my entire day around newborns.

254
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,710
So i-I try not to in my personal life.

255
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,980
Thanks for asking, though.

256
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,400
I'm super flattered.

257
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,220
Super.

258
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,270
His... and his.

259
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,090
I-- as
discussed.

260
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:53,070
Thank you.

261
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,350
Newborn.

262
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,870
I'm not a newborn.

263
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,610
I'm a--I'm a
senior resident.

264
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:03,740
I'm a great surgeon.

265
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,880
I'm a--I'm a divorc
for god sake, right?

266
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:12,200
I'm... I'm, uh, looking for you
to agree with me here, Bailey.

267
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,350
Bailey?

268
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:19,030
The chief, he... he wrote me a
form letter of recommendation.

269
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:21,410
What? That's insane. He's
the chief and you're bailey.

270
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:24,280
"Pleasant in the O.R.
And enjoyed by the nurses.

271
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,010
"She has completed a
serviceable amount of research.

272
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:30,630
...A fine addition
to any program." Fine.

273
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:33,310
He used the word
"fine." Well--

274
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,730
A blank page would mean more.

275
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:38,130
I pulled off a
12-person domino surgery.

276
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:41,840
I took out and put back six
of a dying girl's organs.

277
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,560
I am Dr. Bailey.

278
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,860
I am better than fine.

279
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,560
Well, at least he didn't call you a baby.

280
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,940
Just a minute more, Mr. Terzian.

281
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,410
Oh, done tending to her highness?

282
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,820
You know, you're tough on people.

283
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:04,570
It's good to hold such high
standards, but this is medicine.

284
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,820
No one's perfect.

285
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,550
She's stubborn and out of touch.

286
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,600
So her 40 years of
experience means nothing?

287
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,790
Well, no, uh,not if you
don't use them correctly.

288
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,740
Now she wants to be
old and keepperating?

289
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,910
Fine. Just keep up with the medicine.

290
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,620
Cristina, this is one case.

291
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:22,010
You can't judge someone
based on one case.

292
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:26,960
That patient deserves to know who his doctor
is,no matter whose feelings it happens to hurt.

293
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,940
Paparoscopic or open,none of
us should've made that mistake.

294
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:12,150
Yang, you realizethat you're charging one of o
hospital's most respected surgeons with negligence?

295
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:14,010
Yes, sir.

296
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,470
Dr. Hunt, do you agree
with Dr. Yang's assessment?

297
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,040
This is Dr. Yang's call.

298
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,260
I'm asking you, Dr. Hunt.

299
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,920
Campbell outranks me, sir.

300
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,890
Uh, I think it would be best for
you to discuss it with her directly.

301
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,340
Very well. Dr. Yang, page Dr. Campbell.

302
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,890
Tell her I want to speak to
that patient before the surgery.

303
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:35,120
Yes, sir.

304
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:40,190
Way to take a stand.

305
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,670
There he is-- the
legend himself.

306
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,990
How are you, legend?

307
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:50,090
Are you drunk? Should
I be worried about you?

308
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:52,350
And he's got his sense of humor back.

309
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,730
- Yeah.
- How's your patient?

310
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:54,920
She's good.

311
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,050
Stable.

312
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:59,560
You know,today's the first day in a long time that
I remember what it feels like to be good at my job.

313
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,820
You? Come on.

314
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,210
You're like the Dalai Lama of surgery.

315
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:07,760
People from all over the world come here to
let you cut into 'em, and you know what else?

316
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,820
You look good doing it.

317
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,200
I like the facial hair, by the way.

318
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,760
Keep it that length--
no more, no less.

319
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,120
Okay, okay, all right, stop.

320
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,280
Derek, there's something
that we need to discuss.

321
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,270
Go ahead and have sex with addison.

322
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,550
- Addison? What? No.
- Go for it.

323
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,760
I don't want to have sex with addison.

324
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,220
Really?

325
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,640
Well, what did you want to discuss?

326
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,690
Nothing.

327
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,000
Okay.

328
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,600
How's my mother?

329
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,660
Bitter, angry.

330
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,150
Genius.

331
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,260
Know what's so wrong?

332
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:50,840
Is how much the chief and your mother
fought-- the sex must've been great.

333
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,640
Okay,you saying
that-- that's wrong.

334
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,100
- What's wrong?
- Our entire health care system?

335
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,810
- 'Cause I agree.
- Wait, here it is.

336
00:17:56,810 --> 00:18:01,380
- Okay, "March 3rd, 1979-- "assisted
margaret campbell on a splenectomy.

337
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,220
Impressive rum?

338
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,500
adequate technique."
See? Hack. Even then.

339
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,060
You're working with Margaret Campbell?

340
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:11,940
Yeah. The oldie timey thinks she's still
sane enough to keep doing surgeries.

341
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,470
See, that's what I like about your mom.

342
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:15,580
She wasn't all alzheimer-y
and still operating.

343
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:21,380
Do me a favor and shoot me if I start making mistakes
on patients and still think it's kosher to keep cutting.

344
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,530
Sounds like Shephard.

345
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:23,710
Alex--
please.

346
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:27,140
My guy is right. Your guy nicked an aneurysm,and
now he's trying like hell to cover his ass.

347
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,380
Your guy needs to shut up.

348
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,580
- What happened?
- The patch must have blown.

349
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,470
Page addison. Tell her to
meet me in the O.R. Let's--

350
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,040
-  I just called her parents.
- I told 'em everything was okay.

351
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:44,100
Hey, Dr. Shephard--
look, I don't understand.

352
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,810
He said that the surgery was a success.

353
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:49,210
Okay,I'm gonna come out and give
you an update as soon as we can, okay?

354
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,270
The swelling's not going down.

355
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,590
Maybe the ventriculostomy is plugged.

356
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,000
No.

357
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,410
Damn it.

358
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:09,100
Derek?

359
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,340
I have to take out the temporal lobe.

360
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,540
Won't that kill her?

361
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:20,790
No, um, but she could lose some
of her speech, uh... voice, memory.

362
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,490
The brain can rewire.

363
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:25,090
I've done it before to stop seizures.

364
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:27,480
have you done it before for this?

365
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,020
I'm doing it now.

366
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,550
Baby's got decels again.

367
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:34,430
What are we doing here, Derek?

368
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:38,820
Bayonet Forceps.

369
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,560
What are we supposed to say to this guy?

370
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,210
"Dr. Shephard's cutting out parts of your wife's
brain, but we're hopeful she'll pull through"?

371
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,370
No, we're gonna tell him the truth.

372
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:49,190
We're gonna say that Dr. Shepherd is doing
everything he can to save your wife and child.

373
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,500
Yeah, well, this guy's life ended
as he knew it.Let's tell him that.

374
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:56,590
- Alex, just be-- the baby's
having some heart fluctuations but,

375
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:00,520
uh, Dr. Ontgomery is taking every
precaution to avoid an early delivery.

376
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,910
And my wife?

377
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,580
Dr. Shepherd is trying to get
the bleeding under control,

378
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:07,550
But we really won't know more
until the surgery is finished.

379
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,720
But she won't die?

380
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,220
Please tell me she won't die.

381
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:19,480
Dr. Shephard is doing everything
he can to make sure your wife lives.

382
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:23,470
- She'll live?
- Dr. Shephard is doing absolutely everything he can.

383
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,370
We should get back.

384
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:28,810
Right. Of course.
Yeah. Uh, thanks.

385
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:31,630
- Thank you.
- Your guy sucks.

386
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:39,970
Mr. Terzian. Your skin's showed a change
from Dr. Campbell's original assessment

387
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:44,500
There was a complication from the
surgery, a lacerated bile duct and artery.

388
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,760
You'll need another
surgery to repair it.

389
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,340
Is that all?

390
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,560
Yes, that's all.

391
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,820
Oh, thank god.

392
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:57,490
I-I thought when they told me the ch-- the chief
of surgery was coming in, I was a goner for sure.

393
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:03,780
We simply wanted to make you aware that it's
within your rights to request a change of surgeon.

394
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:06,590
Uh, Dr. Campbell's not available?

395
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:08,270
She's available.

396
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,790
Oh, then no, thank you.

397
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:12,170
I-I-I choose
Dr. Campbell.

398
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,550
Very well.

399
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:14,870
Dr. Campbell.

400
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:16,570
Richard.

401
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:23,910
Sir? Sir, with all due respect, I don't think
the patient's entirely clear on what happened.

402
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,560
You heard the patient, Dr. Yang.

403
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,650
- He wants his
doctor.- But, sir, she--

404
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:29,240
Back down, Yang.

405
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,670
Come on. I just need you to tell
me if it's worthy of d bailey.

406
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:35,260
Dr. Bailey is an ass. Say that.

407
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:39,100
Say that she doesn't listen to the residents when
they have important information about the interns.

408
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:43,260
I think you're missing the point of the
exercise, which is to say nice and impressive things.

409
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,450
You still hang out here?

410
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:55,010
George, just... say she's
dependable, say she's selfless.

411
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:56,630
Everything she was until she wasn't.

412
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:59,570
Just... you should probably go.

413
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:04,320
Dependably selfless.

414
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,850
Thank you.

415
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,360
Isabel Stevens?

416
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:28,220
It's been years since I've
had you in my O.R., Chief.

417
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:35,320
I seem to remember an incident with a clamp
being dropped into an open body cavity.

418
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,440
You're never gonna let
me live that one down, huh?

419
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,800
A good teacher never
lets up on her students.

420
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:47,160
Although I've often wondered how the upcoming classes
learn anything with the way we teach these days.

421
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,460
Attendings seem more concerned
with inspiring their students,

422
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,860
using encouragement and
validation and so forth,

423
00:22:54,860 --> 00:23:01,450
instead of instilling them with the fear and shame that
actually causes one to remember anything in the first place.

424
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:03,830
Dr. Hunt, you come from the military.

425
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:08,700
Wouldn't you say the more rigid aspects of your
training helped you become the doctor you are today?

426
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,560
Yes, ma'am.
Very much so.

427
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,960
Dr. Yang, on the other hand, well,

428
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:17,240
something tells me fear is not
something you've often faced in the O.R.

429
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,550
I'd appreciate any opportunity to learn.

430
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,780
Wonderful.

431
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:28,440
Let us begin then. Tell me how
you do a pulmonary emboleomy.

432
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:33,910
I'd insert a steerable catheter into the femoral
vein,then position the fluoroscope adjacent to the embolus.

433
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:38,330
What would you do if the
power should suddenly go out?

434
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:45,800
Or if you had to operate in a hospital
that couldn't afford a fluoroscope?

435
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:51,070
Look, it's like a calculator. Do you think just
because there's a machine to do it for them,

436
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:54,050
children shouldn't have
to learn simple arithmetic?

437
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:57,140
- I mean...
- If it will help them avoid mistakes like this one.

438
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:10,710
Out... of my O.R. I said get out. Out!

439
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:14,270
This is still my O.R.!

440
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,870
She's bleeding into the frontal lobe.

441
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:23,260
Now if I can just stop the bleed,save
the rest of the brain, she'd have a chance.

442
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:27,630
Decels are getting longer.

443
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,810
Derek, I have to deliver the baby.

444
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:34,670
No, she--just... she's
lost too much blood.

445
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:36,270
If you cut her now, she'll
bleed out. I can save her.

446
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,270
How?

447
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:43,720
I have to cut out the frontal lobe.

448
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,040
What?

449
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,510
D-Derek, no. Stop, Derek.

450
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,450
You've done enough.

451
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:51,130
Her frontal lobe? Can she live without
her frontal lobe and her temporal lobe?

452
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:53,220
- Yes.
- No, Derek, she can't.

453
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,660
Listen to me. This baby is
not getting any oxygen now.

454
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,940
I know that you want to save Jen. I know
you feel like you have to, but not this way.

455
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,980
I can do this. I can save
them both. She will live.

456
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:04,610
Not as the person that her
husband and child need her to be.

457
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:08,300
She'll lose everything about
her that makes her human.

458
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,760
Meredith.

459
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,520
Are you sure you can do this?

460
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,460
I have no choice. Bipolars.

461
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,330
- The baby's heart rate is bottoming out.
- Damn it, Derek.

462
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:19,790
Okay, damn it. We've gone--
this has gone too far.

463
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:23,680
Taking the frontal lobe out, even if she
does live, you are creating a monster.

464
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,800
You don't get to play god here, Derek.

465
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,280
Jen is gone, but this
baby has a chance to live.

466
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,410
You need to let her go. Let it go.

467
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:35,950
Please let... I'm taking the baby out.

468
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:38,190
Put down the scalpel, Addison!

469
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,400
You put down the scalpel.

470
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,050
Addison, put the scalpel down.

471
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:00,940
You put the scalpel
down! You have to let her go.

472
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:04,690
Take your hand off the scalpel, Addison! You
take your-- take it off!

473
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:10,330
- Meredith, go get the chief.
- Do not go anywhere.

474
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,560
Karev, go!

475
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,890
Derek, don't do this.

476
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:23,700
Do not touch my patient, Addison.

477
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,560
Meredith...

478
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,450
Derek, look at me.

479
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,730
You don't have to do this.

480
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:45,350
Jen's gone. It's too late.

481
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,680
You can't save her.

482
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,160
She's gone.

483
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,180
We can save the baby.

484
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,580
Derek... look at me.

485
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:01,180
Certain surgeries get
the best of all of us.

486
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:06,850
I made a mistake, a careless mistake...

487
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,440
and for that, I am sorry.

488
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:14,620
But I am only human--
as human as any of us--

489
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:19,440
and for that... I do not apologize.

490
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,970
- Margaret, you don't ha to-- no
need to discuss it further, Richard.

491
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,770
No need at all.

492
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,940
Chief, we need you in O.R. One.

493
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:31,310
- Karev--
right now, sir!

494
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:40,700
I was fired... from the army.

495
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:46,180
They call it an honorable discharge, but...
they knew it was my time even though I didn't.

496
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:50,850
I'm grateful to them for that.

497
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:10,940
The baby's still in
distress. I need to take it out.

498
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:13,030
Wait. Just wait.

499
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:14,780
The bleeding could stop.

500
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,270
The baby could stabilize.

501
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:18,060
If you do a c-section now,she'll
lose too much blood and she'll die.

502
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:21,540
- She is dead, Derek
- Please just wait.

503
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,520
Most of her brain is gone. For all
intents and purposes, she's dead.

504
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,050
Karev, page Dr. Freedman's team.

505
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:36,220
Tell them we have a preemie on the way.

506
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,120
Stop cutting!

507
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,840
Why are you cuing?!

508
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,570
Meredith, get some more blood.

509
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:52,320
She needs more blood.

510
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:55,000
Get some more blood.

511
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,320
We need more blood.

512
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,040
No more blood,derek.

513
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:05,310
No more blood.

514
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:12,230
You're smart to get it looked at, but
it doesn't look too suspicious to me.

515
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,890
Even combined with high L.D.H. Levels?

516
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:19,990
Oh... that could be caused by
anything-- mono, exercise even.

517
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:24,940
coupled with neurological
episodes, hallucinations?

518
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:28,280
There we go.

519
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,170
All done.

520
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:32,590
You and I both see
patients do this every day.

521
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:36,130
They find something suspicious and
convince themselves they're sick.

522
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:42,250
But as doctors,you and I both know
that it's our job to remain worry free

523
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,970
Until we have actual medical
proof that says otherwise.

524
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:46,700
So that's what you
should do--relax.

525
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:51,400
By this time tomorrow, you'll be laughing at the fact
you thought there was anything wrong in the first place.

526
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,860
Okay. Ready.

527
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:00,310
He looks strong.

528
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:05,160
Okay. He definitely has a chance.

529
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:07,940
All right, let's get him
intubated. Let's get the placenta.

530
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:37,640
The steroids we gave your wife
allowed your baby's lungs to mature.

531
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,030
That combined with the three extra days

532
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:46,040
that Dr. Shephard took to do the surgery
makes us very hopeful that he'll survive.

533
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:49,020
I don't understand.

534
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,010
She just died?

535
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,380
I'm sorry.

536
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:00,930
Yeah, I know. You said that.

537
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:05,560
Um... I'm asking how she died.

538
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,280
We believe your wife's high blood
pressure is what caused the bypass to fail.

539
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:17,940
That caused the bleeding and
the swelling in the brain.

540
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,830
Dr. Shephard did everything
he could to save her.

541
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:22,430
There was too much damage to her brain.

542
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:25,570
That's when Dr. Montgomery
stepped in to deliver the baby.

543
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:34,050
You said it was a routine procedure
but that she would be fine.

544
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:39,210
Then there was a complication...
and you said you fixed that.

545
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:48,630
but then the baby got sick,and that made jen
sick,but then you said that you fixed that,too.

546
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:51,060
And now she's dead?

547
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,180
I'm sorry.

548
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,940
Stop saying you're sorry.

549
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:00,060
You killed her.

550
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:04,820
You're a murderer... a murderer.

551
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,970
Where's my wife?

552
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:14,130
I want my wife. I want my wife.

553
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:20,960
I want my...

554
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,890
I-I want...

555
00:32:29,301 --> 00:32:30,561
I know it's bad...

556
00:32:30,561 --> 00:32:33,301
but... I tried.
You're just... very complex.

557
00:32:34,101 --> 00:32:35,551
Hard to wordify.
- Ch-Chief?

558
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:40,180
That is a letter of recomendation.

559
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,650
O'Malley? You want me to
take pointers from O'Malley?

560
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:45,510
You'd be hard-pressed to find a
better person to take pointers from.

561
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,420
C-chief.Chief.

562
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,830
Exactly.

563
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:52,520
I am the chief of surgery.

564
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,100
And I don't have time to
write letters to pump your ego.

565
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,360
My head of neuro is
being called a murderer.

566
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,060
I have to fire my longest-standing
general surgeon because she won't retire.

567
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,380
Interns are mixing up blood
samples in your clinic.

568
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:07,440
And you want me to spend my time writing
a recommendation so you can leave me?

569
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:08,890
Leave you?

570
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:13,670
Sir, I'm... applying for a
fellowship in pediatric surgery.

571
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:15,750
Which is not what we had discussed.

572
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,520
Do you know how much
of my time you wasted?

573
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,170
Do you know the amount of
work it takes to groom someone?

574
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:21,720
You were supposed to become the next me.

575
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,830
You wanted me to become the next you.

576
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:25,470
Now I'm not your son or your daughter.

577
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:28,190
You don't get to pin all your
hopes and dreams on me, sir.

578
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,100
I'm seeing Lexie.

579
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,830
Well, I'm sleeping with
her, too, but it's more than that.

580
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,130
We're happy.

581
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:46,690
I'm happy.

582
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:56,020
Okay ,that's... maybe I deserve that.

583
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,240
No, you know what? I didn't deserve that.

584
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,230
You have no right to tell
me who I can sleep with--oh!

585
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,670
You're worried about your legacy.

586
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:38,800
But I am not your legacy,and
me applying  peds is not--

587
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,900
you are not listening to me, sir.

588
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,100
What the...

589
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,740
Come on. Come on.
Stop.

590
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,590
Come on, stop.

591
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:51,700
What in the world?

592
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,300
Come on.
Thank you.

594
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:02,310
That's her guy.

595
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:24,030
I would do a
pulmonary arteriotomy--

596
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:28,410
directly visualize the clot and use
atraumatic forceps to extract it.

597
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:31,660
That's how I would do a pulmonary
embolectomy without a fluoroscope.

598
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:38,040
The fact that you felt the need to come and tell
me that tellme that you're a much better surgeon

599
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,340
than I first thought.

600
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:45,070
I've decided today's
surgery was my last.

601
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,510
You look at me like you won't wake
up one day not that far from now--

602
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:55,770
so much faster than you can
imagine-- and find that you are me.

603
00:35:56,350 --> 00:36:01,550
When you can't cut
anymore, what will you have?

604
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:05,160
I was a god...

605
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:10,570
in this O.R. Holding a
scalpel... I was a god.

606
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:13,290
And now...

607
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,260
What will you have?

608
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,530
I don't see anyone
burning the place down.

609
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:45,040
That's how they do it-- do everything right,and
as soon as you look away, they screw it all up.

610
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:49,630
Hey, uh, I'm sorry I was
busy earlier with myself.

611
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:52,190
I was busy, so I'm sorry.

612
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:54,210
Don't be.

613
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:57,790
I called you an ass, so...
and you were right.

614
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:59,860
I think I just needed to vent.

615
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:02,530
I... I'm sick of this place.

616
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:06,850
Hell, I just watched dek shepherd
beat up a man 'cause he's sick of it.

617
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,400
That's the way it works.

618
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,060
The patients we lose, the mistakes
we make-- that's how we learn.

619
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:15,280
That's the only way it's ever been done.

620
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,890
Figure out a better way,and you,izzie stevens, will
be a better doctor than the rest of us.

621
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:23,740
<i>Patients see us as gods...</i>

622
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:28,900
Izzie.

623
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:31,550
<i>Or they see us as monsters.</i>

624
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:35,290
<i>But the fact is,we're just people.</i>

625
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,650
Okay, well, it's not
broken, but you should ice it.

626
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:46,180
Lots and lots of ice, okay?
Bye.

627
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,050
I'm so sorry.

628
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,030
It was worth it.

629
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:55,060
No. It--it--it
wasn't.

630
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,610
Maybe a little.

631
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,170
Thank you.

632
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:04,620
<i>We screw up...</i>

633
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:08,270
<i>We lose our way.</i>

634
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:19,620
I have experience to give... Calliope.

635
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:22,230
Life experience, like the
fact that I was married.

636
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,590
Did you know that?

637
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:25,970
Or that I was in the peace corps?

638
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,230
Botswana.

639
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:29,020
That's what convinced
me to go to Med school.

640
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:31,730
And most recently, I've, uh, experienced
the joy of cooking.

641
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:36,270
Yeah. I make an excellent chicken piccata
in addition to many other delicious meals

642
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:38,070
that you'd be very lucky
to experience yourself.

643
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:43,030
And the fact that you can't open your
eyes to see that makes you inexperienced.

644
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:48,420
Calliope, this is Julie...

645
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,500
My date.

646
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:59,340
<i>Even the best of us have our off days.</i>

647
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,250
Letter of Recommendation.

648
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:11,060
Callie told me about the chief's letter.

649
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:15,080
I figured it's the least I can do
before I get on a plane back to L.A.

650
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,620
Addison Montgomery, thank you.

651
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:20,930
No need to thank
me. Just, you know, kick ass.

652
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:24,850
Don't make me regret writing that you're
the most promising young peds surgeon

653
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:27,680
I've ever had the
pleasure of working with.

654
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:33,210
<i>Still, we move forward.</i>

655
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:41,070
Today you were-- you were a teacher
to someone who needed to learn,

656
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:43,960
but you were also a bully to
someone who needed compassion.

657
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,470
You were both.

658
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:51,490
Well-- I wasn't
a bully and... I was right.

659
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,490
Right.

660
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:58,240
You know, you're a lot like her--
stubborn, opinionated... smart.

661
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,210
40 years from now, I'm gonna have to
pry that scalpel out of your hand, too.

662
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:04,960
From my cold, dead hands.

663
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,320
you're missing the point.

664
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:12,550
I want to be around 40 years from now.

665
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:36,760
<i>We don't rest on our laurels  or celebrate
the lives we've saved in the past.</i>

666
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,310
Oh... oh, god.

667
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:00,790
<i>Because there's always  some
other patient  that needs our help.</i>

668
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:19,870
<i>So we force ourselves to
keep trying, to keep learning...</i>

669
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:23,490
You're unmotivated,you're
careless, selfish,

670
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:29,040
distracted and pretty much the people in this
hospital I would least trust with my life.

671
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:31,980
But that's the way it's supposed to be.

672
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,470
You're interns.
You're babies.

673
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,120
And you're all lucky to work here.

674
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,860
We're all lucky because
we get to save lives.

675
00:41:38,526 --> 00:41:40,166
Every day, we get to save lives.

676
00:41:40,166 --> 00:41:42,316
That's what we do.
That's our job, and...

677
00:41:45,246 --> 00:41:47,326
it's not something a lot
of people get to do, so...

678
00:41:47,976 --> 00:41:48,916
<i> In the hope that...</i>

679
00:41:49,138 --> 00:41:49,778
- Let's begin.

680
00:41:49,778 --> 00:41:50,738
<i>Maybe.</i>

681
00:41:50,958 --> 00:41:51,538
New game.

682
00:41:51,538 --> 00:41:52,488
<i>- Someday...</i>

683
00:41:52,488 --> 00:41:54,488
This is patient "X".

684
00:41:54,619 --> 00:41:59,699
She's a 29-year-old female we misdiagnosed
with anemia the first time she came to us.

685
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:03,679
Let's not make the same mistake again.

686
00:42:03,842 --> 00:42:09,312
<i>We'll come just a little bit closer
to the gods our patients need us to be.</i>
