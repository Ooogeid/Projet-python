1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,520
Previously on "grey's anatomy"...

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:03,010
You got some problems.

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,040
You've got some big problems.

4
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:06,170
I kissed a peds surgeon.

5
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,390
Calliope,this is julie,my date.

6
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:10,320
I'm seeing lexie.

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,050
Oh,my god! I think I broke it.

8
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,020
This is patient "x.

9
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,380
" She's a 29- Year- Old female
we misdiagnosed with anemia.

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,090
I'm applying for a fellowship
in pediatric surgery.

11
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,150
Which is not what we had discussed.

12
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,170
Where's my wife?

13
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,670
You killed her. You're a murderer.

14
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,970
Every surgeon I know has a shadow...

15
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:40,970
A dark cloud of fearand doubt that
follows even the best of us into the o.R.

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,060
- Dude,he is fried.
- He's not fried.

17
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:47,010
He lost a patient and got hit with a
lawsuit all in one week. He just needs time.

18
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,170
He's been sittg there for three days.

19
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,310
The sofa cushions are gonna start bonding
to his ass,and he's eating all my cereal.

20
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,360
He's taking stock.

21
00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:00,020
Something huge and life- Altering
happened to him,and he's taking stock,

22
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,580
Figuring out his next move.

23
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,330
We shouldn't judge him.
We shouldn't rush him.

24
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:03,950
Whatever.

25
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,140
Sylvia plath's picking
out all the marshmallows.

26
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,510
They're the best part.

27
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,260
And I'm pretty sure that
he's sitting on my keys.

28
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,200
I'd ask him to move,but
he looks so... comfy.

29
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,400
Oh,you guys are cowards.

30
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,330
You're eating.

31
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,170
That's good. Appetite is good.

32
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:22,980
You know what else is good?

33
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,040
Showering,cleansing,water.

34
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,020
Are you thinking you'll
shower,maybe go into the hospital?

35
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,990
I have to,for the deposition.

36
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:34,510
I have to go and explain in detail
how I killed a man's pregnant wife.

37
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:35,720
That's good.

38
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,370
I mean,not the
killing part,but the- - 

39
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,620
I- I think you'll feel
better once you...

40
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,770
Go to...

41
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,430
Work.

42
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:51,690
He'll be fine.

43
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,300
We pretend the shadow isn't there...

44
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,930
Hoping that if we save more lives,

45
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,720
Master harder techniques,run
faster and farther,

46
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:05,630
It'll get tired and give up the e.

47
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:08,210
But like they say...

48
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,750
You can't outrun your shadow.

49
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,440
Morning.

53
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,960
I dreamt once I was falling out
a window hanging on to the drapes.

54
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,440
I woke up pulling
meredith's hair out.

55
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,330
So we have a trauma coming in.

56
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,600
A trampling on a
football field- - 

57
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:41,790
No,I- I don't need your help.

58
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,120
Oh,but I'm on your service today.

59
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,270
And I'm telling you,dr. Yang,I
want you to take care of that elbow.

60
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,790
There you are. What happened to you?

61
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,150
I tripped and fell. It's fine.

62
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,660
No. No,it's not.

63
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,850
It's... it's nothing.
It's- - It was an accident.

64
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,240
What's wrong with you?

65
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,370
Uh,derek won't get off the couch.

66
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,000
So the weaker sex.

67
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,910
It's still swollen. I'd
give it another day of rest.

68
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,390
I haven't operated in three days.

69
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,700
Don't hit people with
your scalpel hand.

70
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:10,830
Have you talked to him yet?

71
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,200
He threw the first punch.

72
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,670
Well,you did catch him at a bad time.

73
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,050
So he lost a patient. Boo- Hoo.

74
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,220
We're surgeons. We're
men. We lose patients.

75
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,260
It doesn't give him the right to go
around behaving like a drunk frat boy.

76
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:24,640
And now I'm supposed to go crawling
back begging for his forgiveness?

77
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:28,030
What,uh- -  What
are you doing?

78
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:34,540
I went all "say anything" on the peds
surgeon in front of the peds surgeon's date,

79
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,500
- So now I am hiding from the peds surgeon.
- Mature.

80
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,410
Um,you got in a
fistfight. No judging.

81
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,100
- Hand!
- Hand!

82
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,330
Oh,god. I'm sorry. I... I forgot.

83
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,620
I- - I'm
so sorry.

84
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:51,910
I feel terrible about everything,about
the fight and your hand and derek and...

85
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,670
You know,he's not doing so well. I
really think that you shoultalk to him.

86
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,310
I should talk to him?

87
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:04,100
Look at you- - Your stethoscope
around your neck,charting...

88
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:09,280
I can totally see you in ten years,a little
salt and pepper in your hair,big- Shot attending.

89
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,640
You're gonna be a rock star,alex.

90
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,200
What is this?

91
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:17,340
What,I can't fantasize about my
boyfriend and his bright,bright future?

92
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,470
Shut up.

93
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,200
Dr. Stevens,we've been working on the patient
"x" case,and we have a couple of ideas.

94
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,160
Great,let's get to work.

95
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,770
What's this patient "x" thing
that's taking all the interns?

96
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,200
And when's it gonna be over?

97
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,810
I need minions to do my crap work.

98
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,990
Some new teaching thing.

99
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,110
You know,we're all killing
ourselves to get into the o. R.

100
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,500
When's the last time
izzie held a scalpel?

101
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,910
She's falling behind.

102
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:41,790
She's like the new o'malley.

103
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,160
- Izzie's nothing like o'malley.
- Hello.

104
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,240
Okay,o'malley,you're in the clinic.

105
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,780
Grey and yang,you're with me.

106
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,070
Karev,you're in the pit with hunt.

107
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,750
Oh,no,dr. Bailey,I'm supposed
to be on trauma today.

108
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:54,200
Save it,yang. Hunt wants karev.

109
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,230
J- - Oh! Sir,there
you are.

110
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,470
Shepherd planning to grace
us with his presence today?

111
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,370
Yes. He's fine.

112
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,360
Sir,I- - I've been trying
to page you all morning.

113
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,680
I could use your help on
a case if you're available.

114
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,220
No peds today?

115
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,860
Um,no.

116
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,670
- Must be slumming.
- Excuse me? S- - 

117
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:19,080
Tricia shelley,31,megan
shelley,27,michael shelley,23,

118
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:25,140
Genetic testing revealed they all carry the
cdh1 gene for hereditary diffuse gastric cancer.

119
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,600
Which means at,dr. Grey?

120
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:29,950
Which means they all have a 3- In- 4
chance of developing the cancer.

121
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,850
Dr. Bailey has taken tumors out of
pretty much everyone on our mother's side.

122
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,210
Unfortunately,it's a
highly aggressive cancer.

123
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,110
The tumors grow quickly,so
by the time I get in there- - 

124
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,710
Our family tree is down to a branch.

125
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,580
- How is uncle bud doing?
- Dead.

126
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,640
- And aunt helen?
- Dead.

127
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,370
- What about the minnesota cousin?
- Not dead.

128
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:54,360
She's 90 pounds and in
hospice,meg. Still,not dead yet.

129
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:58,640
So,uh,you've... decided you're
ready to take the next step.

130
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:01,270
We've made a pact. We're
all in this together.

131
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,400
Cut r stomachs out,dr. Bailey.

132
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,260
Beth dearborn,17 year old
with a history of seizures- - 

133
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,270
Had a grand mal during a
marching band performance.

134
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,600
Started seizing again upon arrival.

135
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,690
Push 2 of lorazepam.

136
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,230
She's in v- Fib. Ventilate
and charge the paddles to 200.

137
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,040
Wait. The v- Fib could be just
artifact from the seizure.

138
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,340
If we shock her and she's not
actually in v- Fib,she'll flatline.

139
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,420
- You got a pulse? - I- I
think so.I don't know.

140
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,250
It's hard to tell.

141
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,830
Lorazepam's not working. Damn it.

142
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:30,430
What do we do?

143
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,870
We shock her and save her,or
shock her and kill her.

144
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,200
What the hell...

145
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,880
Clear.

146
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,390
Clear!

147
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,770
- Sinus tach.
- Good call,dr. Hunt.

148
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,720
Ah,it was a 50- 50 shot.

149
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:03,450
Oh,no. It happened again?

150
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:06,630
Beth,I'm dr. Robbins,the peatric
surgeon on call. This is dr. Hunt.

151
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,480
You got beat up pretty bad
while you were marching.

152
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,590
We're gonna run some tests,check
for internal injuries.

153
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,630
I seized during the performance?

154
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,610
But I took my meds.

155
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,740
Relax. It's not like you
crapped your pants or anything.

156
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,510
It is like I crapped my pants.

157
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,600
I had a seizure in front
of the entire marching band.

158
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,330
It is exactly like
I crapped my pants.

159
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,170
They're gonna kill me.

160
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,480
- Who?
- Seizure patrol.

161
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,500
You're the seizure patrol?

162
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,880
I'm first chair
clarinet. He's drum major.

163
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,480
Whenever beth has a seizure,we
have to drop our instruments

164
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,040
And go roll her on her side so
she doesn't choke on her tongue.

165
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,330
We were in the middle of
the northwest reonal parade.

166
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,680
We were favored to win.

167
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,460
Yeah,until beth took down the
snare drum,half of the woodwinds.

168
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,870
The tubas tried to avoid her,but she
was right in the middle of formation.

169
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,050
Ah,okay. Uh,why don't you
just go call her parents?

170
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,140
I'm gonna run some tests,but
she's already coded once,

171
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,410
So I want you to watch her
and standby with a crash cart.

172
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,260
You want me to sit here
and babysit the band nerd?

173
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,210
That's an intern job.

174
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,260
I don't see any interns around.

175
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,640
Dr. Grey.

176
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:11,740
Patient "x," a previously healthy 29- Year- Old
female presented with stable vital signs,

177
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:17,990
A normal physical exam,uh,with symptoms of occasional
right upper quadrant pain,nausea and hallucinations.

178
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:23,080
Head c.T.,chest x- Ray,c.B.C. Were normal,but
chemistries revealed an elevated l.D.H.

179
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,020
So you are this girl's doctor.

180
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,820
She comes to you,she's scared,she
doesn't know what's wrong.

181
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,410
You have to diagnose her.

182
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,700
What do you do next?

183
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,670
What test do you run?

184
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,500
How about a retic count
or peripheral smear?

185
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:36,030
You'd be wasting your time.
The c.B.C.Was normal,member?

186
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:39,040
You said there was abdominal
pain. What about an upper g.I.?

187
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,180
Good.

188
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,010
That is exactly what
patient x's doctor did next.

189
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,910
What does this tell us?

190
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:50,340
What is all this?

191
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:55,750
Possible side effects and complications from prophylactic
gastrectomy,so post- Op,you know what to expect.

192
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,340
Malnourishment,weakness,fatigue...
dumping syndrome?

193
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,710
Oh,that doesn't sound good.

194
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,180
Possible anal leakage?

195
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:05,110
A gastrectomy isn't like
getting your appendix out.

196
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,680
We're changing the way your
entire digestive system works.

197
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,110
This is a serious adjustment.

198
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,440
I'm the president of my frat.

199
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,420
I have a girlfriend.
I go snowboarding.

200
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:16,110
How am I supposed to do all that stuff when I'm
suddenly this weak old man with anal leakage?

201
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:17,960
You know how important
this is to trish.

202
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,260
Trish has run our lives
since we were little kids.

203
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,890
She decides where we go to dinner,where
we go on vacation,where we do thanksgiving.

204
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,090
I'm 23 years old. If I don't want
to butcher myself,she can't make me.

205
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:31,020
So you'd rather die like
mom or grandpa or uncle bud?

206
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,730
And it's not quick,mike.
It's a slow,painful way to go.

207
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:36,470
There's a 1- In- 4 shot
we don't get it,right?

208
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,520
- That's something!
- Don't be stupid.

209
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,870
You are doing this,and
we discussed it.

210
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:44,020
You're not in charge of me anymore!

211
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,490
Meg?

212
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,570
I didn't realize it
was such a big deal.

213
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,840
I just... I just need a little
time to think about it,okay?

214
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,160
No,no,no.

215
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,380
Callahan on e bypass.
Levin on the appy.

216
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:07,040
Damn craniotomy... where
the hell is shepherd?!

217
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:10,220
Uh,you can't rely on shepherd,sir.
Is there anything I can do for you?

218
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,920
Well,my neurosurgeon's been missing
for days,I still have no head of cardio,

219
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,130
I've got general surgeons
quitting on me left and right,

220
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,120
I've got surgeries piling up like
dead fish and no surgeons to do 'em.

221
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:24,440
Well,then now would probably be a bad time to tell you
that my hand's still out of commission,and I can't operate.

222
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,690
You know what? Leave me on the
board,chief. I won't let you down.

223
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,410
I could do that craniotomy,chief.

224
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,200
Put dr. Nelson on the craniotomy.

225
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,870
- Appreciate it,john.
- It's- - It's jim.

226
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,300
You must be new.
Welcome to seattle grace.

227
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,140
I've been here ten years.

228
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:53,180
I was the interim chief of neuro before shepherd
and his red cape swooped in from new york.

229
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,330
Mark sloan,plastics.

230
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,360
We've met... three times.

231
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,340
I don't know why mr. Bimm
ever let her even join band.

232
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:08,240
- Not like she's a master flautist.
- Okay,get out.

233
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,270
Mr.Bimm says we're supposed
to stay with her till her- - 

234
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,730
I got it.I'm seizure patrol now.

235
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,460
Your friends are asses.

236
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,080
They're not my friends.

237
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:23,260
Once you spaz out in front of the whole
school,friends are kinda hard to come by.

238
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:26,820
I know you can't help the epilepsy,but
nobody made you join the marching band.

239
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,180
That's like spreading nerd on nerd.

240
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,380
I like being in the band,okay?

241
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,710
It's,like,the one thing
I'm actually good at.

242
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,050
What'd you do in high school?

243
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:35,110
- I wrestled.
- You' a wrestler?

244
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,560
You wearing tights
under that lab coat?

245
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,670
It was a long time ago that was
in high school. I'm a surgeon now.

246
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:43,880
Fine. Then how would youeel if you seized
every time you went into the operating room?

247
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,580
Yeah,okay.

248
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:52,910
You realize,that as your doctor,I'm
not recommending this,right?

249
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,930
I need to get through
my surgeries today.

250
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,250
Oh,you're gonna get through them,you're
just gonna be in a world of hurt later.

251
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,010
You heard of a dr. Nelson in neuro?

252
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,700
Oh,yeah.

253
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:06,980
- Shadow shepherd.
- Shadow shepherd?

254
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:12,930
Yeah. He's a solid surgeon,but sort of the
j.V.Player to shepherd's varsity,the,uh,b- Team,

255
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:15,610
To shepherd's "a," the- - The
bricklayer to shepherd's architect.

256
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,050
I get it.

257
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,780
Just 'cause the guy doesn't
publish fancy clinical trials

258
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:24,590
Or take on flashy surgery or have
creepy,perfect hair,he's less of a man?

259
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,640
Kinda.

260
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,910
How'd it go with the lawyers?

261
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,230
They told me my death rate.

262
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,490
These are the people I saved.

263
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,280
These are the people I killed.

264
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:51,680
Okay,well,most of those people
were terminal when they came to you.

265
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:52,980
You were their last chance.

266
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,280
And you take on impossible cases.

267
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,860
Lo at the clinical trial.

268
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,940
So many people... more than
dahmer,manson,bundy combined.

269
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,700
You're not looking
at the big picture.

270
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:10,140
This is the big picture.

271
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,400
Oh,shepherd. Thank god you're back.

272
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,150
Can you swing two
brain biopsies today?

273
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,060
I'm not operating,richard.

274
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:23,240
Look,I know you've got a big lawsuit breathing
down your neck,and I know you lost a patient,

275
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,230
But I need you back to work
doing the job I hired you to do.

276
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:26,960
I'm not operating.

277
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,590
I am not asking,I'm telling,as
chief surgeon of this hospital,

278
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,680
If you don't get back to
that o.R.Today,shepherd...

279
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:40,160
And he just walked out. Without
saying a word,he just walked out.

280
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,320
Hunt won't even look at me since he went
all "apocalypse now" on me this morning.

281
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:46,650
Had to get all scalpel happy up in that
patient's brain,and now he can't face it.

282
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,450
He thinks I'm,what,like
this wilting flower?

283
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,530
Well,guess what. I'm the strong one.

284
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:50,870
Oh,my god. I'm the strong one.

285
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:54,530
And you see,if I had that stomach cancer
gene,I would get that gastrectomy,no problem.

286
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,830
I face things. I don't walk away.

287
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,990
Derek walks away. Maybe
walking away is the answer.

288
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,620
See,it's not emotional. It's science.

289
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,280
You have a problem,don't ignore it.

290
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:04,290
Well,sometimes if you have to pee
and you ignore it,it does go away.

291
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,540
You guys are hilarious.

292
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,900
I mean,do you even
know what she just said?

293
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,960
Or what she just said?

294
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,140
I can totally see you guys
in 50 years in a nursing home,

295
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,930
Just talking at each other
with your hearing aids off.

296
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,140
Hi- Larious!

297
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:21,790
Oh,I love lunch.

298
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,740
What the hell?

299
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,160
Beth?

300
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,930
Code blue!

301
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:45,000
After I take out the
stomach,I'll do what,yang?

302
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,930
Sew the esophageal anastomosis.

303
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,760
Or the other option is,grey?

304
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,520
You could staple the anastomosis.

305
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,230
Now why would I want to do that?

306
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,790
Fistula rates can be
higher when you hand sew.

307
00:14:55,830 --> 00:15:00,300
You might say that using the old
stapler is sort of my specialty.

308
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,580
I thought your specialty
was babysitting children.

309
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,810
Uh... I'm sure you'd rather
be doing that right now.

310
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,370
Frankly,sir,I feel like I am.

311
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:10,390
Excuse me,sir. I think
you should feel this.

312
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,030
Right here.

313
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,750
Tell me that's not
what I think it is.

314
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:25,320
Wait,wait. I think I got it.

315
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:27,890
Liver enzymes are normal,cardiac
workup is negative- - 

316
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:30,290
- If l.D.H.Is a false positive- - 
It's a trick question.

317
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:34,200
- What?
- She's fine.Patient "x" is fine.

318
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,280
She's not fine.

319
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,770
Okay,well,her sed rate is slightly elevated.
Did we check for autoimmune disease?

320
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,710
Yeah,a.N.A. And c.R.P.
Were negative,too.

321
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,540
At worst,she's got
an anxiety disorder.

322
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:44,590
The girl is totally fine.

323
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:47,900
She is... she is not fine!

324
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:51,450
She had hallucinations.

325
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:59,030
She had visual,auditory and tactile
hallucinations about her dead fianc?

326
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:02,920
She thought she could
talk to him and touch him.

327
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,070
She's not fine.

328
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:08,200
She's not fine.

329
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,190
You're missing somethi.

330
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:14,760
You're not looking
in the right place.

331
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,830
Go back and figure out
what you are missing.

332
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,800
She has it? Trish has cancer?

333
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:29,480
Well,the cancer was stage I,since we got to it
so early,the gastrecty was probably curative.

334
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,170
She just had her
endoscopy a few months ago.

335
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,950
It was an aggressive
cancer that grew quickly.

336
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:38,020
- The fact that we took out her stomach
today- -  It saved your sister's life.

337
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:46,540
The reason trish decides everything- - 
Thanksgiving,dinners,vacations- - 

338
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,350
She's the only one left who
knows how to cook a turkey,mike.

339
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:52,210
She's the only one left who
likes planning vacations.

340
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:55,930
And she's the only one left who ever
remembers to make dinner reservations.

341
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:59,750
She's in crge of us because
everyone else is dead.

342
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:02,430
I want it,now.

343
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,500
I want the surgery right now.

344
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,970
Why is she coding when she
seizes? It doesn't make any sense.

345
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,020
Not in a girl this young.
Her heart should be fine.

346
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:18,280
Beth coded before her
seizure,not during it.

347
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,570
I saw her heart go into v- Fib.

348
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,700
She's 17 with no heart history,karev.

349
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,050
Yeah,I know,but I
saw it on the monitor.

350
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,650
You think you saw it on the monitor.

351
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,790
Seizures are chaotic.
Doctors panic in the moment.

352
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,210
I didn't panic. I know what I saw.

353
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,130
Are you suggesting that I tell
that girl and her parents that

354
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,700
She's been wrongly treated
for epilepsy for six years?

355
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,950
And then I think we should do a
cardiac workup with an e.P. Study.

356
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:37,660
You want me to deliberately shock
a perfectly healthy child's heart?

357
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:40,040
Absolutely not.

358
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,600
Dr. Hunt.

359
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:44,910
If he's right,it would
explain the coding.

360
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,710
If he's wrong,it will kill her.

361
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,550
Look,I'm not wrong!

362
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,630
Then it's your call,karev.

363
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,520
Maybe cristina's right.

364
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:09,130
Maybe trying to teach
the interns is pointless.

365
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,060
Please. Don't listen to cristina.

366
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:15,450
She thinks just because you'd rather teach than
take out a gall bladder, that you're the new me.

367
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:20,790
- O'malley,the sequel.
- O'malley 2.0.

368
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:27,800
You read more journals
and do more research

369
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:32,020
And log more hours in the skills
lab than any other resident here.

370
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,980
You never give up on trying
to be a better doctor,

371
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,920
And you don't step on
other people to do it.

372
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:41,030
I would be lucky to be the new you.

373
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:49,490
Are you gonna tell
me about patient "x"?

374
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,020
- I know whawe missed.
- Gotta go,george.

375
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:56,010
Okay,she had enlarged lymph
nodes,right? But it's not mono.

376
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,880
So what if we missed a
malignancy in her brain?

377
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,660
- Well,you already ruled that out with a c.T.
- I think that was a mistake.

378
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,670
I'd like to order an m.R.I. With
contrast,maybe biopsy a lymph node.

379
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,080
Whatever's wrong with patient "x,"
it's already in her brain,isn't it?

380
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,620
Yeah.

381
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,040
Clamp's going in.

382
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,350
I don't feel any masses.

383
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,400
2- 0 vicryl,please.

384
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,490
Uh,sir,if I may,one more time,I
think stapling would be a betterhoice.

385
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:21,280
If I'm not mistaken,dr. Bailey,you no longer
wish to be a general surgeon in this hospital.

386
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:23,380
So why don't we leave the
technical calls up to me?

387
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,970
I was simply expressing my opinion
on what would be best for my patient.

388
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,070
Okay,you don't get an opinion here!

389
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,080
This is my patient because
this is my hospital.

390
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,990
When it's your hospital,you
can make the damn decisions.

391
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:34,630
But until then,this is my hospital!

392
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,200
And I want all of you
people to do what I say!

393
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:47,530
Yes,sir. 2- 0 vicryl,please.

394
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:57,640
You're gonna be okay.

395
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,110
You're in really good hands.

396
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:10,360
I'm gonna ask you
one more time,karev...

397
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,030
Are you sure about this?

398
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:15,190
Yeah.

399
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,400
Then you're on crash cart.

400
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,790
If you're wrong... be ready tuse it.

401
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,440
Your path report came back clear.

402
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,460
There are no cancerous
cells in your stomach.

403
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,260
How's your pain?

404
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,320
Uh,the wound hurts a little.

405
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,960
- Not too bad,right?
- Yeah.

406
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:55,950
- Don't you remember how much pain mom was in at the end?
- No.

407
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,880
You used to help me wet
her lips with an ice cube.

408
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,190
It was awful.

409
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,100
She couldn't even drink.

410
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,740
She had so many tubes everywhere.

411
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,030
I don't remember.

412
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:08,780
I was 2 years old when mom died.

413
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:15,040
The only reason I know it was sad and
horrible is because you tell me all the time.

414
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,330
I don't have nightmares
about funerals.

415
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:22,660
I don't freak out and think it's
cancer every time I have indigestion.

416
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,510
You .

417
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,940
Mike- -  This
is your fear.

418
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:28,580
It's not mine.

419
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,190
So just... let me
decide when I'm scared.

420
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,090
Let's take the pace up to 300.

421
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,630
Vitals are still stable.

422
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:44,290
This is pointless. The study is
showing no sign of arrhythmia.

423
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,990
Wait. V- Tach.
She's in v- Tach.

424
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,510
- All right,let's just pace her
out of it. - Take it to 3- 3- 0.

425
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:49,290
- B.P.'S down,60 over 10.
- 340.Damn it.

426
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:51,280
She's not breaking.
Karev,get in there now.

427
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,090
Wait,hold the shock.

428
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,840
She's coming out.

429
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,530
This could be a.R.V.C.

430
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:08,920
The right ventricle's
causing the arrhythmia.

431
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,330
Her brain doesn't get
oxygen- -  And then she seizes.

432
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:13,630
Oh,my god.

433
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:19,040
Karev,you just saved
this girl's life.

434
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:35,350
It's okay. It's okay.
Just... just breathe.

435
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:37,600
Put the paddles down and breathe.

436
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,350
It's okay.

437
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,630
It's okay.

438
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:55,390
Well,it wasn't easy.

439
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:59,490
Not only did I push through my harelip
reconstruction and a tympanoplasty,

440
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:04,450
But I pulled out a burn graft so beautiful
it could bring a grown man to tears.

441
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,470
Chief?

442
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:12,430
You haven't heard
from shepherd,have you?

443
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:19,240
No,sir. I haven't.

444
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:22,410
Sir.

445
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:26,390
Okay,I have tried to let it
go,because I know it's not personal.

446
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:28,790
I understand it's very hard for you.

447
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:31,950
I understand you're under
a great deal of pressure.

448
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:35,440
But the way you yelled
at me in the o.R.

449
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:38,030
Today,in front of my residents?

450
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:41,530
Not okay,sir. Not okay at all.

451
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:44,910
Now... you and me,we're just gonna
have to find a way to work together.

452
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:49,930
So you... not talking to me now?

453
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:56,800
Well,that's... just real mature,sir.

454
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,880
That's real mature.

455
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:05,010
We have a diagnosis.

456
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,770
Go ahead,dr. Grey.

457
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,810
Patient "x"- - An elevated
l.D.H. Was our only clue.

458
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,880
Uh,and then we found out that she had enlarged
lymph nodes and a suspicious mole,which was biopsied.

459
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:22,750
Meanwhile,this m.R.I. With contrast
showed a met on her right temporal lobe,

460
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:25,160
And the biopsy
revealed dividing cells.

461
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:34,340
That coupled with further staging tests led to our final diagnosis
of metastatic melanoma with mets to the liver,skin and brain.

462
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:40,880
Your prognosis?

463
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,490
With chemo and
radiation,uh,a few months.

464
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:46,450
At best. Girl's pretty much toast.

465
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:48,580
Survival rate's 5%.

466
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:51,160
If I were her,I'd go on
a really good vacation.

467
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:54,890
Or go to church,ask
for forgiveness,prayers.

468
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:01,210
Good job,everybody.

469
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,560
That's it?

470
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,740
After the last
contest,we got a prize.

471
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,800
Yeah,what's our prize?

472
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:15,770
You think every time you diagnosis a
patient,handomeone a death sentence,there's a prize?

473
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,180
The prize is... you didn't
screw it up this time.

474
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,120
The prize is you people
actually did something right.

475
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,300
The prize is you were doctors today.

476
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:29,370
You were doctors.

477
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,140
" Adele? What are you doing here?

478
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,460
Conference room,richard. Now.

479
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,540
You,too,miranda. Let's go.

480
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,750
It's a pacemaker.

481
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:05,150
It's going to regulate your abnormal
arrhythmias so you won't have any more seizures.

482
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,330
So... I'm not sick anymore.

483
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,090
A wrestler fixed me.

484
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:14,290
Not exactly. You still have
a serious heart condition.

485
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:16,070
So we're gonna set you
up with a cardiologist.

486
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:18,040
But no one has to know.

487
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,730
I won't be frothing at the mouth.

488
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,910
I don't have to wear
a bracelet to school.

489
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,510
I can cover this with a shirt.

490
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:26,160
Yeah. That's something,huh?

491
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,280
It's everything.

492
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:31,670
Once people see you as sick,they
don't see anything else.

493
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,820
Mr. Bimm just called.

494
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:37,810
We didn't get a trophy.

495
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,320
There's always next season,right?

496
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:44,250
Yeah,we were thinking maybe you
should try out for choir or debate.

497
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:47,000
- Something requiring less movement.
- Yeah.

498
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,750
We're just worried for your safety.

499
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:52,580
You don't have to be. We fixed her.

500
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,640
- Epileptic bone.
- What?

501
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,970
There- - There's no such
thing as an epileptic bone.

502
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,180
Are you a doctor?

503
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:04,640
So she's... like,totally normal now?

504
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,020
Dude,none of you are normal.

505
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,970
You're freakin' band nerds.

506
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:20,900
Of all the petty,ridiculous,infantile- -  Are
you running a hospital here or a playground?

507
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,690
- Adele,I will not be spoken to in
that- -  Hospital or playground,richard?!

508
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:27,760
Hospital.

509
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:33,900
Then start acting like the chief of a
hospital and apologize to that woman,right now.

510
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,680
- Sorry.
- You call that an apology?

511
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,890
Now you better not leave this room
until the two of you work this out,

512
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:45,730
Because if I have to drag myself down here through
rush- Hour traffic again to police this damn jungle gym- - 

513
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,120
Adele,you've made your point.

514
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,690
And you wipe that
smile off your face.

515
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:55,640
You're no better- -  Tattling
on a man to his wife.

516
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:01,270
When you have your stomach
out,you can't eat sugar anymore.

517
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,720
If he's doing this because he doesn't
want to give up his damn jelly beans...

518
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:06,160
I think it's more than that.

519
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:09,230
Or football or girls or snowboarding
or whatever the hell it is.

520
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:11,460
It doesn't matter,not
compared to the alternative.

521
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,530
Well,we'll be as vigilant as we can.

522
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,630
We'll use every
screening tool available.

523
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:18,400
That won't be necessary.
Mikey's gonna have the surgery.

524
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:23,330
Maybe not today,but I'm gonna be on him
like glue to my dying breath until he does.

525
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:26,320
And if he just wants
to be left alone?

526
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:29,790
You don't leave the
peopleyou love alone,dr. Grey.

527
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:34,190
That idiot may noknow it yet,but my
fear is what's gonna save his life.

528
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:45,520
I learned a lot today- -  Diagnosing
a patient from beginning to end.

529
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:49,380
So... thank you for teaching us.

530
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,190
What would you say?

531
00:28:56,510 --> 00:29:00,620
To patient "x"- -  How would you- - 
How would you break the news?

532
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:09,440
Um... I would say that I was very sorry
and- - And that there were support groups that...

533
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:11,870
I don't- - I
don't know.

534
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:15,160
What- - What do you say to
somebody who's- - Who's gonna...

535
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:19,200
You say... they have choice.

536
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:23,710
They can run away and hide
from it,or they can face it.

537
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:25,600
You say they need to be
around the people who love them

538
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:29,670
Because it's gonna be the toughest fight of
their life and no one should have to do it alone.

539
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,450
And then you give them the odds.

540
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:34,990
And even though a 5% survival
rate is bad,it's really bad,

541
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,180
You say...

542
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,730
You say...

543
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,660
Screw the odds.

544
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,610
People die of the hiccups.

545
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,300
My mother died of the hiccups.

546
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,710
And survival rate
for that is what,100%?

547
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,290
The odds are that she
should be alive right now.

548
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:01,020
The odds are that
the- - The odds mean crap.

549
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:04,960
So people should face
it,and they should fight.

550
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:10,410
Maybe not those words.

551
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,480
No.

552
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,400
Exactly those words.

553
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,870
Thank you,dr. Grey.

554
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,180
How's she doing?

555
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:29,620
Uh,she's,uh,she's stable.

556
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,380
You did a hell of a job today,and
the chief is gonna hear about it.

557
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,740
Pretty impressive for a resident.

558
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:40,990
You fix that attitude of yours,you could be
the future of this hospital,the one to watch.

559
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,700
You go,karev.

560
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,280
Iz!

561
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,250
Hunt's letting me do the distal
anastomosis on his fem- Pop.

562
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:57,430
- That's awesome.
- It's crazy.

563
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,140
They just told me I could be the future of
this hospital,that I'm the resident to watch.

564
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,810
And that's... I mean... I'm not the
kinda guy who- -  Like,I don't rise,okay?

565
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:07,920
I sink to the bottom.

566
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:12,670
And now I'm getting all
this- -  This respect,and you...

567
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:16,670
You- - You gotta stop wasting all
your time with this patient "x" crap.

568
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,450
- Alex- -  I know you like
teaching,and that's great,

569
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:23,110
But you need to start treating
real patients with real surgeries,

570
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,510
Because once they see
you as weak,it's over.

571
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,060
And,iz,you could be a great surgeon.

572
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:30,220
We could be great together.

573
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:34,110
You just- - You gotta
stop screwinground,

574
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:39,090
Because I don't want to be the future of this
hospital if you're not there with me,okay?

575
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,850
Okay.

576
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,810
- Alex!
- What?

577
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:15,330
You told adele on me?

578
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,960
You stopped speaking to me,sir. That
didn't exactly leave me many options.

579
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:25,590
I'd like to know,would you have reacted like this
if I had left general surgery for neuro or cardio?

580
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,150
I don't follow.

581
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:29,030
Or is it because you regard
peds as a ft specialty?

582
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:31,410
- Is that what's bothering you?
- Oh,that's ridiculous.

583
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:36,430
Well,maybe,but it seems to me that every
time I do something that you perceive as soft,

584
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:40,420
Like having a baby,taking
some time off to see my baby,

585
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:44,190
Specializing in
babies,I'm dead to you.

586
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,670
- You want to know what I think,sir?
- Not particularly.

587
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:50,830
I think you're scared
that you've gone soft.

588
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:53,760
You ble this whole hospital's decline on
it,and you want to know what I think about that?

589
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:55,010
You're gonna tell me anyway.

590
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,640
It's not doing you one bit of good.

591
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,970
I mean,surgeons are still
dropping like dominoes around here.

592
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:02,230
So maybe it's time that you got
in touch with your feminine side.

593
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,880
Maybe you need a little soft.

594
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:11,090
You still shouldn't
have ratted me out.

595
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,220
Sorry.

596
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:16,010
Me,too.

597
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,850
Wh- What are you doing?

598
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:26,540
Assigning myself to
trauma with you tomorro

599
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,540
You know,I'm a big girl.

600
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,900
I can handle my share of trauma.

601
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,680
And I get to decide
when I've had enough.

602
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:39,910
It's gonna take a lot more than
a bad dream to scare me off.

603
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:43,770
It's more than a bad dream.

604
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,740
I know.

605
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:07,930
Look,I know... I have no
business asking you for anything.

606
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,700
But I need your help.

607
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,990
I need you to bring derek back.

608
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:17,070
And he's not fine.

609
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:22,770
Sometimes people just
want to be left alone.

610
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:38,190
He's planning to propose.

611
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:41,710
He's been carrying around
a big ring for weeks.

612
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:45,770
That's not a man who
wants to be left alone.

613
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,730
I just thought you should know.

614
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:10,660
Yes,the odds are against us,I'm
a one- Woman wrecking ball.

615
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:14,230
All I do is break you- -  Your hand,your
penis,your relationships,your life.

616
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:19,590
I'd say our survival rate is about
3%,and that's- - That's- -  That's bad.

617
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:22,700
But it's not nothing,and- - And I don't
think that we should give up on this,

618
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:24,800
At least not
yet,because- - 

619
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,670
Okay.

620
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,310
You think you broke me,ttle grey?

621
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:34,550
You're the one who
put me back gether.

622
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,350
- Hand.
- Hand.

623
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,170
Uh,mark.

624
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:48,420
I've got a couple of shepherd's post- Ops to
check in on,but after that,you feel like a drink?

625
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,630
How 'bout a rain check,john?

626
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,220
Jim.

627
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,570
It's jim.

628
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:08,140
So... I've had quite a day.

629
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:13,850
Got my ass handed to me by alex karev,a second- Year
resident,which is humbling for a surgeon,

630
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:16,880
- Especially a know-it-all,type-A- 
- We don't have to do this.

631
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:18,320
We don't have to be friends.

632
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,420
It's a big hospital with lots
of floors,lots of places to hide,

633
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,570
And I'm perfectly okay with
doing that for the next few years.

634
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,720
You're not hearing me,calliope.

635
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,210
Sometimes I panic in the
moment,and I call it wrong.

636
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:31,410
I misjudge a situation.

637
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:36,090
So if you're up for it,I'd
like to take you to dinner.

638
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:42,200
Maybe.

639
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:44,010
Maybe?

640
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,970
Yeah,my schedule's kind
of insane right now.

641
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:49,290
So I'll,uh,get back to you.

642
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:55,340
How's,uh,tomorrow?

643
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:11,990
- Good night,iz.
- Night.

644
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:19,990
Um... I've been keeping my
distance 'cause you're with alex,

645
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:25,360
But I just want to let you
know,I'm still here,I still care.

646
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:27,940
Thanks,george.

647
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:29,980
And you don't want to talk about it?

648
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,840
Not yet.

649
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:35,900
- Okay.Good night.
- Night.

650
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,640
You don't like me very much,do you?

651
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:51,740
Uh- - 
No,it's good.

652
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:54,550
It's good,because I need
to tell you something.

653
00:37:54,610 --> 00:38:00,100
I need to tell you because I need to
tell somebody,and... and you're a robot.

654
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:02,190
You can take it.

655
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,490
Okay.

656
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,270
I can't tell you here.

657
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:10,230
- I- I can't.
- Okay.

658
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:14,660
- I can't.
- Okay.

659
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,530
Okay.

660
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:38,760
You cleaned all of your clothes
out of the closet at the house.

661
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:40,860
Go home,mer. Just go home.

662
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:43,800
Well,how long are you
planning on hiding out here?

663
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,200
Because that's what you're
doing. You're hiding.

664
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,630
You made a mistake.

665
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:51,640
She's dead,and you
can't hide from that.

666
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,050
I'm not hiding.

667
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:56,200
I'm done. I'm done operating.

668
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:59,030
Oh,okay. So you're just quitting?

669
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,910
You should understand
better than anybody else.

670
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:03,590
You wrote the book on
quitting,running,hiding.

671
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:05,600
You've written a lot
of books,meredith.

672
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,320
That may be true,but I'm here now.

673
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,320
You're here now?

674
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:17,060
You' wanted me out
since the day I moved in.

675
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,060
That is not true.

676
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:21,810
Because you're incapable of
anything that resembles commitment.

677
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:23,000
You lied to me.

678
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:26,860
You said you were healthy,that
you... you were healed.

679
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:28,450
There's no fixing you.

680
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,560
You're a lemon.

681
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:31,890
Derek shepherd,you are drunk.

682
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,660
And you're angry.

683
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:36,120
And I've been there,so I get it.

684
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:38,110
But that does not give you the right- 
-  Just go home,meredith.

685
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:39,740
You don't get to just
stand here and tell me- - 

686
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:41,790
This is what you want.I'm
giving you an out.

687
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,390
- Go.
- I'm not going anywhere.

688
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,510
I said leave! Meredith,leave!

689
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,910
I know there's a ring.

690
00:39:57,350 --> 00:39:58,940
What?

691
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:01,760
The chief told me. I
know there's a ring.

692
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,380
You want the ring?

693
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:20,450
Here's your ring.

694
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:26,080
Every surgeon has a shadow...

695
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:29,700
Is that the best you've got?

696
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,460
'Cause I'm not bailing.
We're in this together.

697
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,950
Go home,meredith!

698
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:38,060
And the only way to
get rid of a shadow...

699
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,590
Is to turn off the lights...

700
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:45,400
To stop running from the darkness...

701
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:50,440
And face what you fear...

702
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:56,050
Head - On.

703
