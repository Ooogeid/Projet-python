00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,210
Previously on "Grey's Anatomy"...

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,050
I'm in love with you,george,and
I hope you're in love with me,too.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,170
I was named chief resident.

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,810
I've failed my intern test.

5
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:10,970
You can start from the very beginning.

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,270
Repeat my internship?

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,140
- I met a woman last night.
- Hi.

8
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:15,350
You met a woman last night?

9
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,670
I'm lexie.Lexie grey.

10
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,230
he's gone.

11
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,630
I can't leave you,but
you're constantly leaving me.

12
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:27,140
It's over...so over.

13
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:33,500
law1987 product the subtitle by YDY

14
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,320
in the practice  of
medicine,change is inevitable

15
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,420
new surgical techniques  are
created,procedures are updated

16
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,210
levels of expertise increase.

17
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,790
Innovation is everything.

18
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:55,030
Nothing remains the same  for long.

19
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:58,130
We either adapt to change...

20
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:02,710
or we get left behind.

21
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,500
I have five rules.Memorize them.

22
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,200
Rule number one,don't bother sucking up.

23
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,880
I already hate you.That's
not gonna change.

24
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,660
Trauma protocols,phone
lists,pagers.The nurses will page you.

25
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,120
You answer every page at a run--
a run.That's rule number two.

26
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,270
You're supposed to follow me.

27
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:33,090
Your first shift starts
now and lasts 36 hours.

28
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,050
You're grunts,nobodies,the
bottom of the surgical food chain.

29
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:39,120
You run labs,you write orders,you
work every second night until you drop,

30
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,470
and you don't complain.

31
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,030
On call rooms.Sleep when
you can,where you can.

32
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,270
You know,but not with anybody.

33
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,530
Not attendings--
especially not attendings.

34
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,090
Sleeping with attendings--
not a good idea.

35
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,310
Where was I?

36
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:57,160
Um,rule number three.

37
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:00,430
If you're sleeping,do not wake you
unless a patient's actually dying.

38
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,610
The dying patient better
not be dead when I get there,

39
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,680
because not only will
you have killed someone,

40
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,570
you will have woken me for
no good reason.Are we clear?

41
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,290
- yes?
- That was four rules.You said five.

42
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:16,800
Rule number five--
when I move,you move.

43
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,260
Go!

44
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,420
I hate them.you don't
hate them.You hate you.

45
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,920
That was hideous.I feel like a fraud.

46
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,910
I rocked it.I think I'm the new nazi.

47
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,470
Oh,you are not the new nazi.

48
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,260
Meredith,I need to talk to you.

49
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,770
- George.Hi.
- Hey.

50
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,910
- How was your vacation?
- Um,fine.

51
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,640
- Um,meredith,can we
- 'cause mine was...

52
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:46,360
I didn't do much.I hung
out alone...for 17 days.

53
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,810
Which is the last time that I saw you,

54
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,520
the day of cristina's
wedding,which was...well...

55
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,280
then mer and cristina went on
cristina's honeymoon without me.

56
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,140
Girl-on-girl
honeymoon.

57
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,570
and then alex took a road
trip to see ava without me.

58
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,160
I did not go to see
ava.And her name's rebecca.

59
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,970
And I didn't go see her.I
just drove in that direction.

60
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,870
Oh,why is everyone so tingly and hurt?

61
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:08,430
I mean,I'm the one who
was left at the altar.

62
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,770
I'm fine,by the way.

63
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,620
I honeymooned in hawaii and I snorkled.

64
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,370
What'd you do,george?

65
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:17,240
- Um,meredith... - I-I
really need to talk to you.

66
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,610
Uh,hey,you
want to know--

67
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,320
hey,um,this is for
residents only.No interns.

68
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,740
- Yeah.
- Yeah,get outta here.

69
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:24,970
- babies.
- yeah,go away.

70
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,440
007s in traini.

71
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,700
seriously.

72
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,400
I guess I should be going,too.

73
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,640
no,george.We didn't mean you.

74
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,710
- No,I'm an inrn.
- Wait.What did you want to tell me?

75
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,870
Uh,is this how it's gonna be all year?

76
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,340
Because bambi has got
to learn how to cope.

77
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,710
At least he came back.

78
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,070
yeah,cut him some slack.

79
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,900
Dude,he failed his exam and
got left back in kindergarten.

80
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:40,650
Mm-hmm.

81
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,930
He won't even look at me.

82
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,330
Have you seen burke?

83
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,980
No.Have you seen derek?

84
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,950
No.

85
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,050
Wait,you haven't seen either
of them since the wedding?

86
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:53,930
nope.

87
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,780
And you're all fine?

88
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,640
- yep
- Wow..

89
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,660
You're either incredibly
healthy or completely messed up.

90
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:08,810
your interns are back
from holiday today.

91
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,820
Uh,not my interns.They're
residents.I'm free.

92
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,710
Right.Well--here,nurse.The
point is,uh,dr.Yang.

93
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,440
The burke thing--
she doesn't know.

94
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,800
I'm supposed to tell her.

95
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,710
Burke asked me to tell her.Any thoughts?

96
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:23,580
- Honesty always works best.
- Yeah,that's true.

97
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:25,810
You want to get together for
a drink after work tonight?

98
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,440
- Why?
- Well,I don't know.

99
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,020
I just thought it might be a
good idea to get together and have

100
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,700
oh,you don't have anybody to talk to.

101
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,930
No,I have people to talk to.

102
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,770
Addison is gone,burke isn't around,

103
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,540
and you and grey aren't smelling
each other in the elevators anymore.

104
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,260
- I have people to talk to.
- Who?

105
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,430
I have...chief.

106
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,560
I-I have the chief
to talk to.Hey,chief.

107
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,710
Want to get together
for a drink after work?

108
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,860
I don't drink.Dr.Bailey,we need to talk.

109
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,320
- We have traumas coming in.
- You're avoiding me.We need to talk.

110
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,320
About you choosing dr.Torres to
be your chief resident over me?

111
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,820
Respectfully,no,sir.We're
not going to talk about that.

112
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,420
Someone mention a drink
later?'Cause I'm in.

113
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,930
- Nobody mentioned a drink.
- You mentioned a drink.

114
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,810
I did not mention a drink.

115
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:03,010
All right,people.We've got three M.V.C.S

116
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,740
rolling in back-to-back
from a multicar pileup.

117
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,150
We need every trauma room
open and everyone suited up.

118
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,940
Is there anything I-I should do,sir?

119
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:13,450
- Save lives.
- No.I mean as,uh,chief resident.

120
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,560
Anything in particular?

121
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,530
Make sure your residents
run their traumas.

122
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,560
This is their first day on their own.

123
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:24,020
Where...are the residents
you've assigned to this E.R.?

124
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:28,630
Oh.Oh,I,uh,I,uh,I paged
them.I-- I paged them.

125
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,300
- Bailey?
- What?

126
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,840
Uh,I,uh,paged,uh,grey,yang,stevens
and karev,but they're not here yet.

127
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,380
When I page 'em,they come running.

128
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:39,400
Get it together,torres.

129
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,560
Yes,sir.

130
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,910
Okay,you did not have to say
that in front of the chief.

131
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:46,970
You asked...boss.

132
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:49,650
There's derek.

133
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,860
- Is burke with him?
- I don't see him.

134
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,450
Where have you been?We have
multiple M.V.C.S due any second.

135
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,710
we're here,aren't we?We're here.

136
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,190
Just-- just get ready,okay?And
monitor your interns.

137
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,440
Okay,one,two,go get stat packs.

138
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,790
Uh,three,four,go meet the ambulances.

139
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:06,120
- "One and two"?
- No,I can't remember their names.

140
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,120
I don't respond to
being called a number.

141
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,930
George,go wait for the ambulance.

142
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,380
The rest of you come with me.

143
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,180
All right,you guys stand against the wall
and out of the way unless I call for you.

144
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,590
Okay,this is what's
called a trauma situation.

145
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,870
So there's gonna be lots of
activity and a lot of patients,

146
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:26,980
so if you guys have any
questions at all,just ask,okay?

147
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:31,430
I heard she,like,freaked out and
killed a guy and had to go on probation.

148
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,000
great.We're stuck with a dud.

149
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,880
So,hey,you're an intern...again.

150
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,080
Yeah.

151
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,920
I won't tell anybody.The other interns,

152
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,200
- I won't-- -
that's--that's okay.

153
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,050
Do you know which one is meredith grey?

154
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,120
Yeah,I haven't,uh,told her
you're here yet.I was going to...

155
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,500
so you know o I am?

156
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,010
Yeah,I know who you are.

157
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,560
What's she like?I-I mean,is she nice?

158
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,560
'Cause--'cause my dad,he won't--he
won't tell me.Is sh--sh...

159
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,800
uh,grey,don't let them just stand here.

160
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:05,260
Let's move,people.

161
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,020
Unrestrained driver,D.O.A.At the scene.

162
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,140
Just need someone to pronounce him.

163
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,800
Oh,crap.Dead guy.Why'd you get
me all excited with the sirens?

164
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,740
Okay,who wants to see a dead guy?

165
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:21,450
Nancy walters,34 years old,weeks
pregnant.Complete upper arm amputation.

166
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:24,110
Pressure dressings applied.Two
large bore I.V.S started.

167
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:26,560
Did he say "arm"?My arm is gone?

168
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:29,320
Miss walters,you're gonna

45-year-old male,sustained
a knee injury.

00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:37,460
That guy,the guy that's
dead,he hit a deer,

172
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,640
and then the lady hit
him,and then I hit the lady.

173
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,390
knee is blowing up like a balloon.

174
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:45,210

dopey,wide-eyed one?

186
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,930

187
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,360
Oh,you--you

00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:43,860

00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,520
Hey,guys,do you need some help?Please

193
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,810

00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,740

uh,nancy walters.Complete amputation.

196
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:55,270
the baby looks fine,but she's
having some contractionS.

197
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,480
Hi,nancy.I'm dr.Sloan.You
mind if I take a look?

198
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,150
It's a clean cut.

199
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,980
You want to rub up against
me,you gotta buy me a drink first.

200
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,600
Hang antibiotics and put
on a sterile,moist dressing.

201
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,490
There's a chance at
a good recovery here.

202
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,830
Do we have an arm?

203
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,020
They're looking for it.

204
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:12,380
My baby has no father.He's
already down two arms.

205
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:16,090
So he r-really needs me to have an arm.

206
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,840
Get me that arm.

207
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,250
Okay,somebody set up for a
traumatic effusion drainage.

208
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,550
Ah...

209
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,210
and order him 4 of morphine.

210
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,370
she means one of you morons.

211
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:31,580
Get her an 18 gauge needle and a
20 cc syringe and the damn morphine.

212
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,260
hey,uh,morphine's cool,but
I'd kill for something to eat.

213
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,260
A healthy appetite
after a trauma like this?

214
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,550
That's a very good sign,joey.

215
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,680
You think he'll need surgery?

216
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,680
That depends on the x-rays.

217
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,670
knee looks good.No surgery.

218
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,790
okay.This is
cristina-- dr.Yang.

219
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,300
She's working.

220
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,570
Yep,saving lives and taking names.

221
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,520
so...I have these
interns and nothing to do.

222
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:13,530
And,uh,I think I'm a really bad teacher.

223
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,220
And I think they hate
me.And now I'm a fraud.

224
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:19,620
So any chance you wanna
let me in on this?Please.

225
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,960
izzie,this guy was
dead,and now he's undead.

226
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,110
So that kinda makes him like a zombie

227
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,280
my personal zombie.So
no,you can't get in on this.

228
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,230
Now go be A...fraud somewhere else.

229
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,230
- I don't like
you. - Mm-hmm.

230
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:36,230
- let's go,people.
- Excuse me.

231
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,710
You know,where have you
been?I've been waiting for these.

232
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:41,460

Hi.How are you?

I have a patient with a severed arm

247
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:16,060
and no one seems to be able to find it.

248
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,640
Have you seen it?

249
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:19,630

252
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,370
Don't block the
E.R.Doors.I know that now.

253
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,470
That was a good lesson.

254
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,550
- You're the girl from the bar.
- Sorry?

255
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,040

00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,850

missed you this morning.

267
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:07,590
Yeah,I didn't want to be late for
my second first day as an intern.

268
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:11,830
Maybe you can look at it like
this-- you have one up on everyone.

269
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,830
You're gonna be,like,the
rock star intern.

270
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,280
Yeah,I'm sure that's how everyone's
gonna see me when they find out.

271
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,440
Or maybe they'll see
you as the daddy intern.

272
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,550
What?

273
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,860

274
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,710
Oh...I'm not--I'm

Uh,I'm gonna need a jumbo catheter,

308
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:19,680

biggest ambu bag you can find

309
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:22,340

He's been internally
decapitateD.Holy crap.

313
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,440
Yeah,90% of these die in the field.

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,640
And the other 10%?

315
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,860
I've never seen one live.

316
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:42,220

time,though,right?

317

Henry,I'm dr.Shepherd.

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,100
The back of your skull is
disconnected from your spine.

320
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,270
I'm gonna try and
reconnect it in surgery.

321
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,660
Do you understd me?

322
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:59,640

Okay,good.I know it's scary,but I
promise you,I'm gonna do everything I can.

324
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,760
Do you have family?

325
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,070

00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,930
Contact his family.find
out if he's an organ donor.

328
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,940
You,finish up with the
splint,then get him up on crutches.

329
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:27,950
Hey.How's joey?

330
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,530
It's a hungry hippo missing a kneecap.

331
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,080
Can't you assign me something good?

332
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,810
I don't switch out patients,karev.

333
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:34,960
But it's not even surgical.

334
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,110
It's a waste of my skills.

335
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,560
- You're staying here with joey.
- Come on.

336
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,150
- No!
- Fine.I'm going to bailey

337
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:43,580
You are a resident.You go where I say.

338
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,250
my arm is gone.

339
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,730
we have the arm,

340
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,180
and dr.Sloan  checking right
now to see if we can reattach it.

341
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,150
Is there someone we can call?

342
00:15:56,270 --> 00:16:00,980
There's no...no,I
just...I just moved here.

343
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:05,330
I'm all-- I'm all by
myself.There's no one.I have no one.

344
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,980
Well,dr.Sloan should be here any minute.

345
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:10,500
I wanted a kid and...

346
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:14,000
I was sick of waiting
for the right guy,so...

347
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,480
in my family...

348
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:20,730
in my family,you don't
go out and get pregnant.

349
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,800
So now I'm alone and...

350
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:26,020
I'm having a baby,and I don't
have a father for the baby,

351
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:29,360
- and I don't have an arm.
- it's okay.

352
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,440
Here's dr.Sloan.

353
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:36,170
Nancy...I'm happy to report
that your arm is in good shape.

354
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:38,770
Dr.Grey here is gonna
clean it up a little,and--

355
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,500
and I'm gonna put that arm
back where it belongs,okay?

356
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,170
Okay.

357
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:47,210
Okay.

358
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,970
We got a 150-pound female with...

359
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,160
lacerations on the chest and
haunches,short,fast breaths.

360
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,470
Any recommendations?

361
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,500
Uh,doctor,michael's a big boy.

362
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:59,070
He doesn't need you to perform
make-believe medicine,right,michael?

363
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,420
it's not make-believe.She can help.

364
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,930
Michael,enough.I apologize.We're
just wasting your time.

365
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:04,990
No kidding.

366
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:07,240
- Michael.
- Please don't let her die.

367
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:10,230
Michael,it is a deer.

368
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,620
We're gonna take her home and
skin her and freeze the meat,okay?

369
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,070
What?Why?!

370
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:17,060
Because that's what you do.You
don't try and save 'em.You eat 'em.

371
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,230
No,daD.The doctor can save her.

372
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,680
- No,she can'T.
- You don't know that.

373
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,610
My son needs to learn to
grow up and face things.

374
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:28,130
You're rht.I am not helping him.

375
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,170
I'm helping bambi.

376
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,410
So get me the ambu bag and
the sane.I'm starting an I.V.

377
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,360
Thank you.

378
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,560
Still no sign of burke.Oh,you've
got a severed arm.

379
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,870
My arm.Mine.Get away from it.

380
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:47,160
Maybe he's not on today.

381
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,680
Maybe you should just see
him and get it over with.

382
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:49,440
No,no,no,no.

383
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,270
If I never see him again,I won't care.

384
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:53,250
Well,I've seen derek,and
derek has seen me.

385
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,140
And?Awkward.Plus he seems to know lexie.

386
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:56,740
And?

387
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,790
More awkward.Your
intern is my half sister.

388
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,860
How weird is that?

389
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,390
Well,I'm trying to save bambi's life.

390
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,570
My interns think I'm a loser.

391
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,790
- Severed arm.
- Callie's a bitch.

392
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:07,120
- Word.
- She won't let me off my patient,

393
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,600
and there's nothing wrong
with him except he's a nut job.

394
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:10,610
Severed arm.

395
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,200
Does anybody know anything about deer?

396
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,510
Ey taste good.

397
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,880
Evil.

398
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,160
Oh,george,severed arm.

399
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:21,860
Plus mer's half sister is my
intern,izzie is playing dr.Dolittle,

400
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,010
oh,and alex hates your wife.

401
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,310
Dr.Sloan's ready for the arm.

402
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,950
- I'll say it.
- George is being an ass.

403
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:30,860
I think it's my fault.

404
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,640
I said some things,and
now he's not talking to me.

405
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,200
I don't know what he's
got to complain about.

406
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,690
Those new chick interns are hot.

407
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,870
- He's married,alex.
- Yeah,he's married.

408
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:41,320
You know who's seriously
hot?That lexie girl.

409
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:45,240
Get out...before I hurt you.

410
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,550
I'm going over callie's head to bailey.

411
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,210
Uh,callie is over bailey's head.

412
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,400
Spiritually,bailey's
over everyone's head.

413
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,700
dr.Bailey.How are things goi?

414
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:58,070
I wouldn't know.Ask dr.Torres.

415
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,420
- Miranda
- I don't want to talk.

416
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,560
Miranda,it is not like
you not to want to talk.

417
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:05,150
Fine.How's your wife?

418
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,420
Well,she'S...she'S...good.

419
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,940
I haven't moved back in yet.

420
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:14,040
She hasn't let me  move back in yet.

421
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,070
She's not taking my calls.Wait.

422
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,750
That's not what I want
to talk to you about.

423
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,480
I want to talk about chief resident.

424
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,950
Now we're gonna have this conversation.

425
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:24,480
Are you ordering me to stand here
and talk to you about this,chief?

426
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,550
No,I'm not ordering you.

427
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:28,140
- But I just thought we could
- okay,then.Good-bye,sir.

428
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,500
I talked to the family
they're on their way.

429
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:35,400
GoodI put an entire O.R.On
hold.We don't have much time.

430
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,400
Uh,can I get a progress note?

431
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:40,930
Uh,do you maybe want
to have a drink later?

432
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,270
- What?
- A drink.

433
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,890
Give me one reason
why we can't hang out.

434
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,310
I don't like you.

435
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,550
You don't like me because of meredith?

436
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,580
I don't like you because you're you.

437
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,580
Hmm.How is meredith,by the way?

438
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:55,920
Is she okay?

439
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:56,980
She's fine.

440
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,340
She's always fine.That's her problem.

441
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,690
We're fine people.We do fine.We're fine.

442
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,300
How's dr.Burke?I
haven't seen him around.

443
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,900
Is--is he
off today?

444
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,620
Here.

445
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:19,700
Dr.Burke handed in his letter
of resignation two weeks ago.

446
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,840
He wanted me to tell you.

447
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,730
He's g-gone?

448
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,430
I'm sorry.

449
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,630
- Well,don't be.I'm
- fine?

450
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,730
Yeah.

451
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:54,050
- Circulatory system of a deer?
- Shut up.

452
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,970
Oh,dr.Bailey.

453
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,110
Uh,couldn't you use an extra
set of hands in the O.R.Today?

454
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,510
I saw an appy on the
board.I'm--I'm great at appys.

455
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,490
Talk to torres.She's in
charge of what cas you get now.

456
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,450
It's hard to set a shattered kneecap
when your patient's in the pit,

457
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:09,570
don't you think?

458
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,580
whatever.

459
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,760
I don't know how you did it.

460
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,270
Did what?

461
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,910
Get 'em to listen to you,to
give you some respect.

462
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:26,370
Hey,dr.Bailey,you wouldn't happen to know anything about,

463
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,270
uh,the anatomy of a deer?

464
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,480
Not my intern,not my business,not anymore.

465
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,560
Your husband's injuries are s-severe.

466
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:43,070
Uh,they're traumatic in the extreme.

467
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:45,090
I'm sorry.What does that mean?

468
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:49,840
The only thing holding his head 
on to his body is skin and muscle.

469
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,620
If he moves even a fraction of 
an inch,it could kill him.

470
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:55,480
S-so are you saying that the--

471
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:59,120
I'm--I'm saying that when you see him,
this could be the last time--

472
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,800
this could be the last time you see him alive.

473
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,420
are you in pain,sweetie?

474
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:15,000
Good.

475
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:18,120
Two blinks-- you aren't in pain.

476
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:21,440
Why isn't daddy answering?

477
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:24,470
Just-- right now we just need to 
wish daddy good luck in his surgery

478
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,880
and tell him how much we love him.Okay?

479
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,520
'cause we do.

480
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,410
I love you so much,henry.

481
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:42,950
What's--what's three blinks?

482
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,310
Uh,we've only been working with one and two.

483
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,760
Is it "I love you"?

484
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,730
Are you telling us you love us?

485
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:57,440
three blinks is I love you.

486
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,950
We're gonna be fine,henry.

487
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:07,810
You're gonna make it,and we're all gonna be just fine.

488
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:10,730
it's time to go.

489
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,640
Okay,guys.Let's let these doctors fix daddy up.

490
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:52,260
george.

491
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,240
George.

492
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:58,230
why are you avoiding me?

493
00:23:58,670 --> 00:23:59,630
I'm on my way to surgery.

494
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,510
No,I don't mean right now.I mean.

495
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:06,440
not one word i17 days?

496
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:10,960
I tell you that I love you,
and not one word?Where have you been?

497
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:12,310
I've been right here.

498
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,760
You know where? Exactly where I was a year ago.

499
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,140
I'm sorry.

500
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,350
I--I'm freaking out.

501
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,630
I'm an intern again.

502
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,010
Yeah,we're all freaking out.

503
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,900
We're all freaking out.

504
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:28,860
I'm in charge of a group of interns who think I'm crazy.

505
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:32,060
And I might actually be crazy,
because day one of me being in charge,

506
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,480
and I'm obsessed with rescuing bambi.

507
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:35,180
We're all freaking out.

508
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:37,070
Since when did you start calling me bambi?

509
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,590
- What?
- I'm not calling you bambi.

510
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,720
No,I mean,I know I-I-- I under--
I expect it from cristina or alex,

511
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:44,210
- but-
- I'm bambi.

512
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,500
I'm bambi,george,okay?

513
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:51,100
If anyone in this situation is 
a sad little cartoon character,it's me.

514
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:54,920
I'm all alone in the forest--
all alone in the forest,george--

515
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:58,110
and my mother's been shot by a hunter,and where are you?

516
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,580
Where the hell are you?

517
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:06,640
I'm on my way to surgery.

518
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,520
I really am up for a drink,you know?

519
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:15,940
If you,uh,need to talk.

520
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,850
What would i need to talk about?

521
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:19,460
Meredith.

522
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:20,880
You were lucky,man.

523
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,310
That girl jerked you around.

524
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,010
You have no idea what you're talking about.

525
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,540
Hey,I'm just.

526
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,820
seemed like you could use a friend about now.

527
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,320
Meredith's mother never wanted her.

528
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:34,780
and her father was never man enough to hang around.

529
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:38,080
She has a right to be damaged,and us,
together,it's a big step for her.

530
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:39,850
Her best friend gets left on the altar,

531
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,940
and all she sees now is things like this,they don't work.

532
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,010
She panics.

533
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:43,820
She wants this.

534
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,200
She doesn't know how to have it.

535
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,260
And you know what?

536
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,460
That's not her fault.

537
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:49,330
So don't ever talk to me about meredith grey again,

538
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,670
because you do not know  what you're talking about.

539
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,910
And I don't need a friend.

540
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:03,420
Okay,nancy,I want you to count back from a hundred,okay?

541
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,410
No.

542
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,610
No.I'm not ready.

543
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,240
It's just like going to sleep.

544
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,620
I can't do any of this alone.

545
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:10,270
I don't want to be alone anymore.

546
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,030
I know.

547
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,530
- No,I'm scared.
- I know.

548
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,090
I am scared,meredith.

549
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,530
I know.

550
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,860
I think it's very brave,what you're doing.

551
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:25,520
It's much better to be alone and feel like 
a success than to be in a relationship

552
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:27,370
and feel like a failure all the time,right?

553
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,130
That's what I think.

554
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:35,630
So let's just take care of your arm,
and then we'll deal with the rest later,okay?

555
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:44,410
Well,it looks like I'm back to babysitting.

556
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,370
What the hell? Who took my clamps 
and the bandage scissors?

557
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,880
joey?

558
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:00,780
there's a foreign body.

559
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:01,620
His abdomen's rigid.

560
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:03,200
Somebody page dr.Bailey right now.

561
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:03,990
Go!

562
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:05,610
Come on,joey.

563
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,310
you like hamburgers,don't you?

564
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,680
Yeah.

565
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:16,320
And spaghetti with meatballs,and lasagna?

566
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:17,490
Mm-hmm.

567
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:19,790
That's beef.

568
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,830
That's cow you're eating,son.

569
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:23,110
What do you mean?

570
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,550
Could we have the "circle of life" lesson later?

571
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,090
I need to get in here.

572
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,230
Sorry.

573
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:36,390
her eyes are glassy.

574
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,360
You,get in here and ventilate.

575
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,460
We're losing her.

576
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:47,540
This is absolutely childish and ridiculous.

577
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,440
No,it's not.

578
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:49,820
It's not childish to hold on to hope.

579
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,320
It's actually hard-- very,very hard.

580
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:54,570
Your son just wants to believe that 
some things can work out for the best.

581
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:56,470
Get me the paddles.

582
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,840
Come on,come on,come on.

583
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:00,590
What's she doing?

584
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,330
Insuring we never see the inside of an O.R.This year?

585
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,220
she's in v-fib.I'm gonna shock.

586
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,830
Charge to 300 and stand back.

587
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,280
okay,clear.

588
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,420
oh,my god.

589
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,350
Oh,my god.She's alive?

590
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,810
It worked.She's okay.Everything's gonna be okay.

591
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:31,660
oh,my god.

592
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,210
Got a big bleeder.

593
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,860
Dr.Grey,press and hold right here.

594
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:40,060
she's having contractions.

595
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,310
Well,take a look,george.

596
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,030
Probably the stress.

597
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,080
No,these are strong,and they're two minutes apart.

598
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:47,130
call O.B.And get someone in here.

599
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:49,470
Uh,I don't think there's time to call O.B.

600
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,940
Her water just broke,and she's crowning.

601
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:52,050
Call peds.Get a warmer in here.

602
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,340
This baby's coming now.

603
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,480
O'malley,get her up in stirrups.

604
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:56,090
Can we put her in a reverse trendelenburg,

605
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,530
have one of the nurses press  
her abdomen since she can't push?

606
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,070
Try it without all the jostling.

607
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,870
I'm holding on to a major artery here.

608
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:03,740
Okay,clamp.

609
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,660
Scissors.

610
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,110
I got it.

611
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,350
I got him.

612
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,500
great job,george.

613
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,050
Thanks.

614
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,680
yeah,yeah,we're all heroes.

615
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:25,050
Now if no one minds,I'd like to get this woman's arm sewn on.

616
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:30,820
like she said,she's gonna need it.

617
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:39,100
I'm starting the fusion now.

618
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,530
Did.

619
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,490
he just move?

620
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,960
oh,he d-- he definitely moved.

621
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:47,940
The anesthesia's light.

622
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:50,600
- Yang,stabilize his neck.
- okay,three,come and grab his feet.

623
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:53,100
Go under the drape and do not contaminate the sterile field.

624
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,330
we need to keep him very still until he is under.

625
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,040
We can't risk even the slightest movement.

626
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:00,240
You cannot move.

627
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:00,980
Do you hear me?

628
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:02,320
This is not an option.

629
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:04,190
Everything is not gonna be fine if you move.

630
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,710
It will be the opposite of fine.

631
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,510
You cannot leave the people you love.They need you.

632
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,340
not just the memory that you love them.

633
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:27,640
Anyone care to explain to me how 
my patient wound up in this O.R.

634
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:29,250
And I wasn't even informed?

635
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,660
Karev?

636
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,810
dr.Karev didn't page you because 
he knows how to prioritize.

637
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:41,340
Ten minutes ago,this patient was 
coding from a perfed abdomen.

638
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,950
Under the circumstances,

639
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,180
dr.Karev's quick thinking is the reason 
that your patient is even still alive.

640
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,010
I'll expect a fully dictated chart 
before you leave tonight,karev.

641
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,160
Ah,jackpot.

642
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:56,470
Did he swallow those?

643
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,170
Poor fool.He must suffer from pica,

644
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:03,780
an uncontrollable urge to eat any and everything.

645
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:05,770
Check it out-- a buffalo nickel.

646
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:09,410
Dr.Bailey,I saw you were scrubbed in.

647
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:12,520
I thought I'd stop by and see what you've got.

648
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:13,790
What I've got?

649
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:19,710
$2.37,sir.in change.

650
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,310
it like a cute festival in here.

651
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:42,630
I delivered that one an hour ago.

652
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:44,840
Oh,my god.

653
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,640
W-- why aren't you,like,jumping up and down?

654
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,670
I've done this before.

655
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,700
This is d??

656
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:00,410
look,george,you didn't pass your intern test.

657
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,560
You know,it--it happens.

658
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:03,720
It's--it's nobody's fault.

659
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:05,900
Right?

660
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,800
It's nobody's fault.

661
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,350
Yeah,it's just that callie gave cristina the study cards,

662
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,990
and meredith didn't write anything down,
and cristina was planning a wedding,and izzie--

663
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,220
izzie just had to.

664
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:21,230
you know,I'm--I'm-- I'm responsible.

665
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,000
I've always been the responsible one.

666
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:24,150
I'm not saying,"what about me?"

667
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,110
I'm not saying,"when do I get what I want?

668
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,970
"When do I get to be someone  other than 
the guy who repeats his intern year?"

669
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,850
- I'm not saying that,but-
- but what about you?

670
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:31,980
Yeah!

671
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,670
I didn't plan on being here.

672
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,730
I was all set for an internship at mass gen.

673
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:42,960
And then.

674
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:46,090
my mother gets the hiccups,and I'm at a funeral.

675
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,960
You know,we all have problems.

676
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:57,180
Mo die,and dads drink so much that they 
don't even know what year they're in,and sisters--I--

677
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:01,950
I didn't even know that there was 
a meredith grey until a couple of months ago.

678
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,490
And she won't--she doesn't even want to talk to me.

679
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:07,960
I don't want to be here.

680
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,280
You know,I.

681
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,310
I'd giving anything to not be here.

682
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:16,940
You know,to--to have my life work out the way I planned,

683
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:19,790
to even have time to ask,"what about me?"

684
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,730
So you--you change.

685
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,220
You--you get over it.

686
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:28,210
I'm here now,so.

687
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,370
and you.

688
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,200
you delivered a baby today.

689
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,710
So.

690
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,820
stop feeling sorry for yourself.

691
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,270
You.

692
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:55,920
are kind of awesome.

693
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,260
I know.

694
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,890
**Psych's prepared to consult on the patient?

695
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,150
Thank you.

696
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:22,800
Now whether you like it or not,you and I are gonna talk.

697
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,980
- Chief-
- I know you're angry and disappointed.

698
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:26,370
No,I'm not angry.

699
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,770
I'm not disappointed.

700
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,650
I'm speechless.

701
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:32,310
I don't want to talk because I am speechless.

702
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,660
It makes me speechless to realize you didn't think that.

703
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,740
I would've made an-- an excellent chief resident.

704
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:40,610
You're right.

705
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,800
You would've made an excellent chief resident.

706
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:46,320
But you'll make an even more excellent surgeon.

707
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:50,140
You belong in the O.R.,Bailey.

708
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,340
Focus on honing those skills,

709
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:57,540
not on how well you can juggle 
schedules or fill out paperwork.

710
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:00,450
Believe me,I know.

711
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:02,710
You'll thank me for this one day.

712
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,690
But not today.

713
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:21,150
I'm the one that could use a friend.

714
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:24,910
I said that you could use a friend.
I could use a friend.

715
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:28,090
Look,mark-- no,I didn't come to seattle for addison.

716
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,360
I didn't come to seattle to be chief.

717
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:31,190
I came to seattle for you,okay?

718
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,130
I came to seattle to get you back.

719
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:44,590
I know.I want to take it back now,
but I already said it,so.

720
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,570
maybe we should have a drink.

721
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,340
We could.

722
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:52,080
Yeah.Not today.

723
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,140
I know you didn't wake up this morning 
expecting this was how your first day was gonna go.

724
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:12,470
You thought you'd get to reattach 
an arm or observe brain surgery.

725
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,590
Instead you helped save the life of a deer.

726
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:18,180
You can bitch and complain about it,
or you can adjust your expectations.

727
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:20,240
'Cause like it or not,you're stuck with me.

728
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:23,690
And I'm the kind of doctor who lets 
a little kid convince her she can do the impossible.

729
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:30,700
Oh,plus,when I woke uphis morning,
I thought today was gonna go a lot differently,too.

730
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,640
I thought I was gonna get the good interns.

731
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:34,950
Instead I get stuck with the duds.

732
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:38,380
So I have to adjust my expectations as well.

733
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:34,890
- What?
- We heard--

734
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,510
we heard you delivered a baby today.

735
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,500
On your very first day as an intern.

736
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,830
Yeah.

737
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,660
- what was it like?
- did you do it all by yourself?

738
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:46,020
Was it just like-- did your head 
just explode with the amazingness?

739
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,330
Your very first day.

740
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,210
It was pretty cool.

741
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,080
He came out really fast.

742
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,080
I had to,uh.

743
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,390
you know,determine the position of the cord.

744
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,690
You know what a reverse trendelenburg is?

745
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:18,610
I filled this entire bag with coins 
from my patient's stomach today.

746
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,270
No kidding?

747
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:38,070
I miss rebecca.

748
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,620
I miss burke.

749
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,600
Want some money?

750
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,300
Change.

751
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:04,850
we don't like it,we fear it.

752
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,890
what?

753
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,210
You want to humiliate me some more?

754
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,390
'Cause I get it.I suck.

755
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,610
I suck at my job.

756
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,500
I suck as a wife.

757
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:16,010
I suck all around,so.

758
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,550
go ahead.Humiliate me some more,please.

759
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,890
Hope tomorrow's better.

760
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,830
But we can't stop it from coming.

761
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:38,980
meredith.

762
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:44,440
meredith.

763
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:54,230
We either adapt to change.

764
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,940
or we get left behind.

765
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,760
I,uM.

766
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,350
you're not ready for

767
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,350
no.

768
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,040
I asked for too much.

769
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,470
I think so.

770
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,390
So this is it?

771
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,100
Yeah.

772
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:40,170
We're breaking up.

773
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,400
We're breaking up.

774
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,890
It hurts to grow.

775
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:49,370
Anybody who tells you it doesn't is lying.

776
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,850
We're broken up.

777
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,830
It's done.

778
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,660
so a breakup kiss.

779
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:22,960
A breakup kiss.

780
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,930
And some breakup sex.

781
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,700
Yeah,breakup sex.

782
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:30,490
But here's the truth.

783
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:36,120
sometimes the more things change,
the more they stay the same.

784
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:54,420
and sometimes--  oh,sometimes change is good.

785
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,870
I love you,too.

786
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:04,890
Sometimes change is.

787
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:08,890
everything.
