1
00:00:08,107 --> 00:00:10,730
Surgeons are detail-oriented.

2
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:13,833
We like statistics and checklists

3
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:15,644
And operating procedures.

4
00:00:15,995 --> 00:00:19,573
Our patients live because we
enjoy following the steps.

5
00:00:19,796 --> 00:00:23,181
But as we much as we'd love to
always rely on the numbers...

6
00:00:23,415 --> 00:00:24,411
The plan...

7
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:27,340
We also know that some of the
greatest medical discoveries

8
00:00:27,374 --> 00:00:29,240
Have happened by accident.

9
00:00:38,298 --> 00:00:40,864
Karev, you still need a lift to--oh,
my-- oh, my god!

10
00:00:40,897 --> 00:00:43,765
What are you doing?! Get out! Uh...

11
00:00:43,797 --> 00:00:45,498
Wh-why are you naked? Oh.

12
00:00:45,531 --> 00:00:47,364
I should go. God.

13
00:00:48,249 --> 00:00:51,397
No, please don't be mad.
Derek was supposed to be alex.

14
00:00:51,397 --> 00:00:53,203
Okay. Well,
alex left ten minutes ago.

15
00:00:53,203 --> 00:00:54,833
And since when are you two still--

16
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:56,350
Since you caught us the first time.

17
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,374
Mm-hmm. Lexie, this is
alex we're talking about.

18
00:00:59,374 --> 00:01:01,608
Emotionally, he's like
me three years ago.

19
00:01:01,608 --> 00:01:04,023
You can't be having feelings for him.
You realize that.

20
00:01:04,023 --> 00:01:06,915
Yeah, of course not. No.
It's--it's just sex.

21
00:01:06,915 --> 00:01:08,786
Okay? There's no feelings involved.

22
00:01:08,786 --> 00:01:09,492
Right.

23
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:12,491
Because you are a
no-feelings type of girl.

24
00:01:14,524 --> 00:01:16,396
Your heart lives in your vagina.

25
00:01:17,194 --> 00:01:18,735
It... does not.

26
00:01:19,005 --> 00:01:21,534
Okay? I swear.
It's... not this time.

27
00:01:21,847 --> 00:01:24,134
Okay. Sure.

28
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:28,817
My heart does not
live in my... vagina.

29
00:01:32,739 --> 00:01:35,205
Mold--penicillin.

30
00:01:35,238 --> 00:01:36,639
Poisonous tree bark--

31
00:01:36,672 --> 00:01:38,505
A cure for malaria. Morning.

32
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:40,975
Morning. A little blue pill
for high blood pressure...

33
00:01:41,381 --> 00:01:42,621
Impotence be damned.

34
00:01:42,938 --> 00:01:44,962
What's going on? Huh?

35
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:46,621
Gotta go.

36
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:49,586
Oh, my god! Dude!

37
00:01:49,971 --> 00:01:51,401
Why is this my morning?

38
00:01:51,718 --> 00:01:53,986
So I flip the patient
into trendelenburg.

39
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,897
Teddy yanks out the
arterial cannula...

40
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:58,343
And connects the arterial
line to a venous line,

41
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,354
And then sets up retrograde
cerebral perfusion.

42
00:02:01,569 --> 00:02:04,168
I mean, like, she was on fire.
I was on fire.

43
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,023
The whole o.R. Was on fire.

44
00:02:09,646 --> 00:02:10,422
What?

45
00:02:11,444 --> 00:02:12,372
Nothing. Nothing.

46
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,752
Just... you two are...

47
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,891
You two are friends now.

48
00:02:17,611 --> 00:02:18,418
Yeah.

49
00:02:18,751 --> 00:02:22,258
And hey, you know...
yocan be her friend, too.

50
00:02:22,339 --> 00:02:23,527
I never asked you not to be.

51
00:02:24,148 --> 00:02:25,438
You decided that all on your own.

52
00:02:27,198 --> 00:02:29,112
So... be her friend.

53
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:30,951
It's hard for us to accept

54
00:02:31,124 --> 00:02:33,367
That it's not always the
hard work... thank you.

55
00:02:33,466 --> 00:02:34,900
Or attention to detail

56
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:36,430
That'll give us the
answers we're looking for.

57
00:02:36,617 --> 00:02:39,149
Dr. Hunti-- I just paged you.

58
00:02:39,338 --> 00:02:41,689
Uh, there's a trauma
on the way. Here it is.

59
00:02:41,826 --> 00:02:43,846
We've got a 41-year-old
motorcycle daredevil

60
00:02:44,013 --> 00:02:46,071
With a closed head wound,
penetrating neck wound

61
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,791
And multiple blunt traumas.
What was the dare?

62
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:50,345
Riding without a helmet apparently.

63
00:02:50,516 --> 00:02:53,871
He's still got some brain waves left,
but barely. Oh!

64
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,573
But sometimes we just
have to sit back,

65
00:02:55,867 --> 00:02:58,250
Relax and wait for
the happy accident.

66
00:02:58,494 --> 00:03:00,658
Oh! Oh, my god! Oh,
my god! That isn't gonna help.

67
00:03:03,503 --> 00:03:05,074
Mnh-mnh. I'm on trauma today,yang.

68
00:03:05,074 --> 00:03:06,609
This one's mine.
I touched him first.

69
00:03:06,609 --> 00:03:07,437
Gary from legal.

70
00:03:07,573 --> 00:03:09,219
I need a statement from one
of you about that fall.

71
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:11,904
You two decide.

72
00:03:12,132 --> 00:03:15,438
You're not even wearing scrubs.
Damn it. This is not over.

73
00:03:15,574 --> 00:03:17,090
Have fun with gary from legal.

74
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:25,085
Okay. One... Two, three.

75
00:03:26,004 --> 00:03:28,063
Teddy, hey. I have an old
patient up in oncology.

76
00:03:28,226 --> 00:03:29,572
And I know that you're
really busy with surgeries

77
00:03:29,707 --> 00:03:32,661
And st-staring at owen hunt...

78
00:03:34,532 --> 00:03:35,073
What?

79
00:03:35,354 --> 00:03:36,758
I've tried to ignore it,
the staring.

80
00:03:37,047 --> 00:03:38,935
But ever since christmas,
with the guitar and the singing

81
00:03:39,108 --> 00:03:40,473
And the stolen looks--well,
I noticed it,

82
00:03:40,473 --> 00:03:44,036
and I can't...Unnotice it.
It's just, I kinof...

83
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,786
I like to fix things--people.
I like to fix people.

84
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,871
Oh, no, no. Dr.
Hunt and I-- ooh, don't,

85
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:53,882
'cause then you're just lying,
and that's no good

86
00:03:54,098 --> 00:03:56,445
My point is, you're
staring and you're sad.

87
00:03:56,634 --> 00:03:58,660
And I think that you need
friends that aren't owen.

88
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,085
And that's where I come in,
with the fixing.

89
00:04:00,085 --> 00:04:03,424
You're going to be
friends with me. I am?

90
00:04:03,616 --> 00:04:05,176
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
I'm an awesome friend.

91
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:08,067
So tonight you'll come out with
callie and me--girls' night.

92
00:04:08,185 --> 00:04:11,006
Maybe bailey will come, too.

93
00:04:14,029 --> 00:04:17,198
Say yes to girls' night.
Yes to girls' night.

94
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,381
Yay! Oh, yay.

95
00:04:18,735 --> 00:04:20,274
Problem solved. Now for my patient.

96
00:04:20,425 --> 00:04:21,929
Elliot meyer.
He needs a lung transplant.

97
00:04:22,094 --> 00:04:25,227
Oh, hey. Uh, I'm down
with a l-lung transplant.

98
00:04:25,368 --> 00:04:28,528
Oh, no... because you
slept with my girlfriend,

99
00:04:28,695 --> 00:04:29,497
And I find at when I look at you,

100
00:04:29,657 --> 00:04:32,966
I want to hit you with a brick.
Dude, that was, like, years ago.

101
00:04:33,137 --> 00:04:36,301
Maybe, but jealousy's
a green-eyed monster,

102
00:04:36,415 --> 00:04:37,674
And if you ask any one of my kids,
they'll tell you,

103
00:04:37,751 --> 00:04:39,141
There's no reasoning
with a monster.

104
00:04:40,366 --> 00:04:41,808
Dude, run away before
I find a brick.

105
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:45,788
As my new friend,
don't judge me for that.

106
00:04:46,805 --> 00:04:49,021
So... my patient, been treated...

107
00:04:49,145 --> 00:04:51,090
I get it. You're upset
little sloan is gone.

108
00:04:51,698 --> 00:04:53,707
But screwing drug reps is not
gonna make you feel better.

109
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,041
Yeah, it is.

110
00:04:56,134 --> 00:04:59,961
No screwing drug reps in
my hospital. Are we clear?

111
00:05:00,296 --> 00:05:02,045
You were much more fun
when you weren't chief.

112
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:03,459
You know that? Get outta here.

113
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,262
Ah.

114
00:05:06,062 --> 00:05:06,813
Dr. Webber.

115
00:05:07,635 --> 00:05:09,775
Welcome back. Oh.
Thank you, dr. Sloan.

116
00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:11,747
Richard, how's your first day back?

117
00:05:12,295 --> 00:05:13,912
Uh, well, so far, so good.

118
00:05:15,368 --> 00:05:17,071
I had to drop this off.

119
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:19,147
I'm sorry you have to do this.

120
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:22,084
Well, this drug testing,
it's part of the rehab program.

121
00:05:22,668 --> 00:05:25,122
Just run it under a john doe,
would you? Of course.

122
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,347
Whatever you need today,
richard, and I mean that.

123
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:30,164
A low-stress day,
let's start there--

124
00:05:31,904 --> 00:05:34,203
Routine surgeries,
a light schedule, home by 5:00.

125
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:34,964
Done.

126
00:05:42,815 --> 00:05:44,806
Yeah, I said that. She slipped.

127
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:46,620
The only person liable here is you

128
00:05:46,795 --> 00:05:48,044
For keeping me from my surgery.

129
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,794
Call my driver and tell
him there's still time

130
00:05:51,057 --> 00:05:52,454
Toake my flight if he
comes straight here.

131
00:05:52,657 --> 00:05:54,985
You passed out in a restaurant
and you have abdominal pain.

132
00:05:55,129 --> 00:05:55,975
You're not getting on a plane.

133
00:05:56,201 --> 00:05:57,613
The pain's gone,
and whatever caused it

134
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,720
Can wait till I get home.

135
00:05:58,898 --> 00:06:01,238
Now let me off of this damn thing.
We're done here, right?

136
00:06:01,367 --> 00:06:04,916
Sir, I need you to move to this gurney.
I got this, yang.

137
00:06:05,049 --> 00:06:06,386
All right? You're not
even in scrubs. Sir,

138
00:06:06,547 --> 00:06:08,283
I need you to stay calm so I
can do a proper examination.

139
00:06:08,407 --> 00:06:11,058
Tell this lady to back off,
jackie. Jackie?

140
00:06:11,492 --> 00:06:12,427
Whatever. It's not--

141
00:06:12,636 --> 00:06:14,468
Look, I've already paged bailey,
and he's not cardio.

142
00:06:14,612 --> 00:06:17,506
So you can lose interest, yang.
Yeah, we'll see about that.

143
00:06:17,756 --> 00:06:21,051
Sir, I'm a surgeon, a very good one.
So is my grandson.

144
00:06:21,202 --> 00:06:23,434
So why don't you take
your hands off me?

145
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:24,427
Wait, he's your grandfather?

146
00:06:24,607 --> 00:06:26,093
I'm serious, okay? I can handle
this till bailey gets here.

147
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,333
No, because you're not allowed
to treat family members,

148
00:06:28,487 --> 00:06:30,366
And he has midepigastric
tenderness and guarding.

149
00:06:30,628 --> 00:06:31,538
It could be ascending cholangitis.

150
00:06:32,254 --> 00:06:33,954
Ascending cholgitis? Really?

151
00:06:34,756 --> 00:06:36,881
With only one of the
symptoms of charcot's triad?

152
00:06:39,635 --> 00:06:40,627
You're a doctor?

153
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:42,469
Apparently a much
better one than you are.

154
00:06:43,584 --> 00:06:44,661
Dr. Harper avery.

155
00:06:45,495 --> 00:06:46,346
And your name, doctor?

156
00:06:48,165 --> 00:06:49,244
Harper avery.

157
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:51,817
Uh, no. That's my name.

158
00:06:52,395 --> 00:06:54,024
As in the harper avery award?

159
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:56,601
Bingo. Get a new surgeon, jackie,

160
00:06:56,772 --> 00:06:58,207
One with a pulse this time.

161
00:06:59,788 --> 00:07:01,495
You're harper avery's grandson?

162
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:07,522
I misdiagnosed harper avery
in front of harper avery.

163
00:07:07,675 --> 00:07:08,753
Do you know what that
does to my chances

164
00:07:08,905 --> 00:07:11,887
Of one day winning a harper avery? Well,
could die before then.

165
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,575
I mean, he could die today even.

166
00:07:13,874 --> 00:07:16,042
I just need to operate on
my motorcycle daredevil guy,

167
00:07:16,171 --> 00:07:18,417
And I'll be fine.
Is it true harper avery is here?

168
00:07:18,554 --> 00:07:21,331
So derek walked in on
her naked this morning

169
00:07:21,515 --> 00:07:22,892
In alex's bed. Meredith!

170
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,091
What?

171
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,399
Oh, I'm just cheering her up.
She's having a bad day.

172
00:07:27,552 --> 00:07:28,311
Be generous. You know what?

173
00:07:28,413 --> 00:07:30,357
You can't be having
feelings for karev.

174
00:07:30,568 --> 00:07:32,765
He's like meredith three
years ago. I said that.

175
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,423
I don't have feelings for alex.

176
00:07:34,633 --> 00:07:36,397
Yes, you do. Your heart's,
like, in your vagina.

177
00:07:36,552 --> 00:07:38,115
I said that. Oh, my god.

178
00:07:38,217 --> 00:07:40,155
You are both monsters.
We're like...

179
00:07:40,267 --> 00:07:42,571
Yang, I heard you met harper avery.

180
00:07:42,778 --> 00:07:45,410
Did you know that pretty
boy's grandfather was god?

181
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,544
I didn't know.
That is kinda cool, though.

182
00:07:47,637 --> 00:07:48,419
No, it's not cool.

183
00:07:48,706 --> 00:07:50,778
Okay, he's an entitled
brat with no skills

184
00:07:50,921 --> 00:07:52,217
Except a really good bloodlin

185
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:55,228
It is not jackson's fault that
he's related to harper avery.

186
00:07:55,528 --> 00:07:57,886
Oh, whatever,
ellis grey's daughter.

187
00:08:02,164 --> 00:08:03,126
Huh? How do I look?

188
00:08:03,318 --> 00:08:05,103
Chiefly? What, are you nervous?

189
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:06,911
He's one of the most powerful
surgeons in the country.

190
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:10,345
He's just a guy Who happens to
have an award named aft him.

191
00:08:10,567 --> 00:08:12,364
Whatever,Ellis grey's
daughter. Admit it.

192
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:14,489
You want to meet him, too.
Ll, yeah.

193
00:08:14,489 --> 00:08:15,564
Thank you.

194
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,549
Hey,here are we on him?

195
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,408
He was on his way up to the o.R.
When he started bleeding out.

196
00:08:20,485 --> 00:08:21,398
Want to give us a hand here, yang?

197
00:08:21,713 --> 00:08:26,206
Oh. Big boy needs a little help.
No problem. Watch and learn.

198
00:08:26,476 --> 00:08:28,024
Clamp.

199
00:08:28,432 --> 00:08:30,137
See? This is why I don't
want you to drive!

200
00:08:30,304 --> 00:08:31,611
I had to get my medication!

201
00:08:31,774 --> 00:08:34,295
The store was gonna close! I'm so-
-can we not yell?

202
00:08:34,751 --> 00:08:36,267
Please. Maybe. No, actually.

203
00:08:36,634 --> 00:08:38,157
My mother's almost completely deaf,

204
00:08:38,396 --> 00:08:39,865
A fact she refuses to accept,

205
00:08:40,037 --> 00:08:42,777
which is why She won't learn sign
language or get a hearing aid.

206
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,701
So we yell. Don't talk to her.
Talk to me.

207
00:08:45,864 --> 00:08:47,225
I'm just telling
them what happened!

208
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,896
She stole my car... again.

209
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:52,104
There's a tenderness over
the zygomatic process

210
00:08:52,322 --> 00:08:54,640
And a hematoma to the
left temporal area.

211
00:08:54,816 --> 00:08:56,745
Okay. Run a head and face c.T.
I'll get sloan and shepherd.

212
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:59,490
She's got a ruptured tendon in
her knee that will need surgery.

213
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:01,032
So she'll be off her
feet for a few weeks.

214
00:09:01,032 --> 00:09:05,200
So more waiting on her
hand and foot? Brilliant.

215
00:09:05,877 --> 00:09:06,810
I saw that, kathy!

216
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,962
They're taking you for scans!
That's all we said!

217
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:11,806
Just quiet down.
Let the nice doctor do her work.

218
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:14,366
Why is this taking so long?!

219
00:09:14,366 --> 00:09:17,195
Is it me or are those two
women terribly annoying?

220
00:09:17,195 --> 00:09:19,100
My apologies, dr. Avery.

221
00:09:19,322 --> 00:09:20,643
We're working on getting
you up to your own room

222
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,274
As soon as poss-
you said that before.

223
00:09:22,908 --> 00:09:27,290
Are you the same shepherd Who did
the clinical trial on the gliomas?

224
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,013
Yes, sir.

225
00:09:28,258 --> 00:09:31,595
You brought me a neurosurgeon
for some abdominal cramps?

226
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:35,426
No, I-I--dr. Shepherd is
our chief of surgery, sir.

227
00:09:35,688 --> 00:09:38,298
I don't need a cruise director.
I need an experienced surgeon.

228
00:09:38,652 --> 00:09:39,970
Page dr. Grey.

229
00:09:42,213 --> 00:09:42,982
I'm dr. Grey.

230
00:09:46,339 --> 00:09:49,589
Either the world's most talented
plastic surgeon works here

231
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:50,617
Or you're not ellis grey.

232
00:09:51,547 --> 00:09:53,206
She was my mother. She passed away.

233
00:09:57,492 --> 00:09:58,639
I-I didn't know.

234
00:09:59,155 --> 00:10:00,293
Uh, my condolences.

235
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:02,529
Who else then?

236
00:10:02,911 --> 00:10:04,886
Does, uh, richard
webber still work here?

237
00:10:05,411 --> 00:10:07,145
Yes.

238
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,983
unfortunately, he is, uh,
he is not available today.

239
00:10:09,983 --> 00:10:11,687
Push 2 of ativan.
Percy, let's get him on his side.

240
00:10:11,918 --> 00:10:13,539
Cristina, watch that neck.

241
00:10:13,723 --> 00:10:15,694
Oh,my god! What are
they doing to that man?!

242
00:10:16,244 --> 00:10:18,152
Oh! Okay. Applying pressure.

243
00:10:18,429 --> 00:10:21,376
Get him back into the room.
I'll page dr. Webber.

244
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:28,117
As you can see, you've got
dilated bowel here and here,

245
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,048
Indicating an obstruction.

246
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:33,121
It's a good thing that
our young dr. Avery

247
00:10:33,334 --> 00:10:34,152
Brought you straight in.

248
00:10:34,341 --> 00:10:35,687
Dr. Bailey can do the
surgery right away.

249
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:40,913
Was it a student,
webber? A board member's wife?

250
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,092
What?

251
00:10:43,331 --> 00:10:45,239
No one gives up a
chief of surgery gig,

252
00:10:45,463 --> 00:10:48,354
And, uh, they don't ask you
unless it's for something juicy.

253
00:10:48,628 --> 00:10:50,523
So who were you
slipping it to? Grandpa!

254
00:10:50,992 --> 00:10:52,147
I'm sorry, dr. Webber.

255
00:10:52,337 --> 00:10:54,850
It was a joke. He doesn't get me.

256
00:10:55,065 --> 00:10:56,300
So, webber?

257
00:10:57,046 --> 00:10:59,459
Uh, dr. Webber decided
to focus on his research.

258
00:11:00,271 --> 00:11:03,609
Oh, the research line.
Well, either way,

259
00:11:04,005 --> 00:11:06,082
At least you'll be
free to do my surgery.

260
00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:09,398
Dr. Bailey is more than capable
of performing the surgery--

261
00:11:09,524 --> 00:11:12,256
I want webber. No offense.

262
00:11:12,851 --> 00:11:13,611
None taken.

263
00:11:15,184 --> 00:11:15,985
And I want to watch.

264
00:11:18,315 --> 00:11:19,148
What?

265
00:11:19,409 --> 00:11:21,617
I'm going to be awake
for my surgery, watch.

266
00:11:24,561 --> 00:11:26,059
So much for the low-stress day. Mm.

267
00:11:29,632 --> 00:11:32,029
A year after mr. Meyer's
lymphoma went into remission,

268
00:11:32,232 --> 00:11:34,557
He was diagnosed with
pulmonary fibrosis,

269
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:36,416
A condition that he
developed as a side effect

270
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:38,949
To the radiation he received
during his cancer treatments.

271
00:11:39,175 --> 00:11:40,549
This isn't new information.

272
00:11:41,099 --> 00:11:42,171
I thought you said you could help.

273
00:11:43,007 --> 00:11:44,302
Yeah, but they're new to the case,

274
00:11:44,532 --> 00:11:46,163
And it's important to
review the entire history.

275
00:11:46,451 --> 00:11:50,066
Great. Uh, can't you do that
on your own time? Jill. Sorry.

276
00:11:50,497 --> 00:11:52,106
My sister usually waits
a few more minutes

277
00:11:52,262 --> 00:11:53,988
Before going full
bitch on new guys.

278
00:11:55,037 --> 00:11:56,407
All right. Let me
tell you what I know.

279
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,692
It is gonna be very difficult
to find you a new set of lungs.

280
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:01,991
Donor lungs are scarce.

281
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:03,820
85% get thrown out

282
00:12:03,994 --> 00:12:06,874
Because they get too inflamed
while the donor is brain dead.

283
00:12:07,921 --> 00:12:09,539
And because your
cancer could come back

284
00:12:09,821 --> 00:12:12,084
With the immunosuppressants
you'd be on,

285
00:12:12,678 --> 00:12:15,319
You are considered a
very high-risk candidate.

286
00:12:15,648 --> 00:12:17,692
There are just too many
other patients on the list

287
00:12:17,892 --> 00:12:18,866
That are lower risk.

288
00:12:20,004 --> 00:12:21,981
Elliot survived
leukemia and lymphoma.

289
00:12:23,485 --> 00:12:25,262
Nobody does that, but he did.

290
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,519
He deserves lungs.

291
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,430
Unfortunately, these are the rules

292
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,890
The transplant board sets out.

293
00:12:32,046 --> 00:12:32,783
I...

294
00:12:34,097 --> 00:12:35,442
I'm sorry.

295
00:12:38,982 --> 00:12:41,026
Dr. Altman, have you looked
into the research they're doing

296
00:12:41,196 --> 00:12:43,058
With ex vivo transplants? Ex vivo?

297
00:12:43,293 --> 00:12:45,322
Well, it's a procedure where
they take damaged donor lungs--

298
00:12:45,558 --> 00:12:46,934
The ones we would
normally throw away--

299
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:49,962
And repair them on bypass.
Are we doing one?

300
00:12:49,962 --> 00:12:50,543
Let me guess.

301
00:12:50,721 --> 00:12:52,352
You want on my service
to make up for the fact

302
00:12:52,525 --> 00:12:54,976
That you humiliated yourself
in front of harper avery.

303
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:56,625
How'd you hear about that?

304
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,427
You made fun of me.

305
00:12:58,661 --> 00:13:00,842
Okay. Fine.

306
00:13:01,351 --> 00:13:04,192
Yes, I-I humiliated myself
in front of harper avery.

307
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:07,354
And my daredevil gorked before
we could operate on him.

308
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,165
So I am available for
your ex vivo lung case.

309
00:13:11,404 --> 00:13:12,948
I don't have an ex vivo lung case

310
00:13:13,184 --> 00:13:15,500
Because it's only been done
in switzerland and in canada

311
00:13:15,684 --> 00:13:17,931
On patients in much better
shape than our patient.

312
00:13:18,128 --> 00:13:18,777
Yes, but...

313
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,675
Okay, performing a procedure
as hard-core as this

314
00:13:23,822 --> 00:13:25,415
While harper avery
is in the hospital?

315
00:13:25,713 --> 00:13:27,642
Well, I mean, he could
hear about it and like it

316
00:13:27,642 --> 00:13:29,353
And--and he's a god
who hands out awards.

317
00:13:29,497 --> 00:13:30,674
Yeah, I don't care about awards.

318
00:13:30,838 --> 00:13:32,696
Oh, come on. Only people who
never win awards ever say that.

319
00:13:36,886 --> 00:13:38,376
So you think this could
be an ex vivo lung case?

320
00:13:38,573 --> 00:13:39,908
I do not have feelings for alex.

321
00:13:41,923 --> 00:13:42,654
I do not care.

322
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:51,552
Ah, here we go.

323
00:13:52,391 --> 00:13:53,404
He's giving them the speech.

324
00:13:54,566 --> 00:13:55,194
What speech?

325
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,198
About the wonders of medicine.

326
00:13:58,286 --> 00:13:59,112
About how as surgeons, you know,

327
00:13:59,404 --> 00:14:01,401
We're meant to push boundaries

328
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,077
And do what no one has ever done.

329
00:14:04,075 --> 00:14:06,534
Sounds motivating.
It's cheesy is what it is.

330
00:14:07,184 --> 00:14:09,350
And you hear it enough times at
your grandparents' dinner table,

331
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:12,388
You can't help but want to be
a surgeon when you grow up.

332
00:14:12,773 --> 00:14:13,738
You had a dinner table?

333
00:14:13,955 --> 00:14:15,745
I didn't know world-class
surgeons had dinner tables.

334
00:14:15,966 --> 00:14:16,714
I feel gyped.

335
00:14:17,987 --> 00:14:19,577
Well, that's 'cause you
haven't heard the speech yet.

336
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,162
...to be awake for my own surgery,

337
00:14:21,417 --> 00:14:24,962
But an opportunity like this,
to be a student again,

338
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:26,765
Get a new perspective--

339
00:14:27,401 --> 00:14:28,938
It's what we got into
this business for

340
00:14:29,196 --> 00:14:30,000
In the first place--

341
00:14:30,447 --> 00:14:33,580
Those moments that challenge
and terrify and dare us

342
00:14:33,715 --> 00:14:35,578
To reach the potential that
we were meant to reach.

343
00:14:36,929 --> 00:14:38,789
No, let's stop the talk

344
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:41,733
And get into that o.R.
And teach those kids,

345
00:14:42,436 --> 00:14:43,255
Teach ourselves...

346
00:14:45,504 --> 00:14:46,659
What it means to be great.

347
00:14:51,043 --> 00:14:54,140
I'm sorry. I can't authorize
an awake surgery, no matter--

348
00:14:54,386 --> 00:14:55,183
We can do it.

349
00:14:57,134 --> 00:14:57,988
Derek, we can do this.

350
00:14:59,195 --> 00:15:00,221
That's what I like to hear.

351
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,717
That's the way a chief does things.

352
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,879
Shepherd, take note.

353
00:15:15,132 --> 00:15:17,842
Dr. Webber. Derek,
I know what you're gonna say--

354
00:15:18,075 --> 00:15:20,087
No. As the sole person
in this hospital

355
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:21,525
Assigned to look out
for your welfare,

356
00:15:21,684 --> 00:15:22,674
I don't support this decision.

357
00:15:27,183 --> 00:15:28,454
I apologize...

358
00:15:29,832 --> 00:15:30,976
Chief shepherd.

359
00:15:35,123 --> 00:15:37,105
You really want to
do this thing? I do.

360
00:15:42,896 --> 00:15:43,676
It's on you, then.

361
00:15:47,319 --> 00:15:49,399
Thank you for your help
on that project. Uh-huh.

362
00:15:49,709 --> 00:15:50,892
Same time tomorrow? Yeah.

363
00:15:54,211 --> 00:15:54,937
Oh, let me guess.

364
00:15:55,145 --> 00:15:56,428
Still no call from little sloan.

365
00:15:56,701 --> 00:15:58,161
Nothing. But it's okay.
I've moved on.

366
00:15:58,352 --> 00:16:01,034
Okay. Yeah, getting out of bed

367
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,398
And not wearing sweats
around the apartment all day

368
00:16:03,643 --> 00:16:04,656
Is a sign of progress.

369
00:16:04,935 --> 00:16:07,300
Sleeping with the nurses?
Not so much.

370
00:16:07,492 --> 00:16:09,869
Well, I wouldn't have to sleep
with nurses If you'd put out.

371
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,677
I'm in a committed,
loving adult relationship.

372
00:16:12,898 --> 00:16:15,314
Tried that. Didn't work.
Okay, whatever.

373
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,730
Just come take a look at this face c.
T. On my patient.

374
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:19,151
Come on.

375
00:16:23,334 --> 00:16:25,097
Get the hell outta here, karev.

376
00:16:25,316 --> 00:16:26,275
What?

377
00:16:26,425 --> 00:16:27,736
Get the hell out. Now!

378
00:16:30,849 --> 00:16:31,550
What was that?

379
00:16:31,937 --> 00:16:34,423
I don't like that guy.
Oh, he slept with lexie once, mark.

380
00:16:34,423 --> 00:16:35,555
You two were broken up.

381
00:16:35,732 --> 00:16:38,199
Actually, he's, uh... never mind.

382
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,997
You don't sleep with
another man's girl.

383
00:16:40,305 --> 00:16:42,232
I learned that the hard way.
Oh, well played.

384
00:16:42,526 --> 00:16:44,089
Oh, don't buy that.
He's acting out because

385
00:16:44,289 --> 00:16:46,240
He can't deal with the real
human emotions he's having.

386
00:16:46,425 --> 00:16:48,162
Ask him how many nurses
he's slept with today.

387
00:16:48,723 --> 00:16:49,659
You're sleeping with nurses now?

388
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:52,035
You said no drug reps.
And I'm a grown man.

389
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:54,288
I can screw whoever I want.
Not in my hospital.

390
00:16:54,525 --> 00:16:56,568
What are you gonna do,
fire me? Maybe I will.

391
00:16:56,761 --> 00:16:58,790
All right. All right.
Enough with the testosterone.

392
00:16:58,956 --> 00:17:00,040
Mrs. Nelson's scans are up.

393
00:17:00,198 --> 00:17:03,747
No bleed. No fracture.
She's good. She's deaf.

394
00:17:04,445 --> 00:17:07,268
Yeah. How'd you know that?
She's got otosclerosis--

395
00:17:07,457 --> 00:17:09,372
Abnormal bone growth
in the middle ear.

396
00:17:09,543 --> 00:17:11,374
If I just remove the bones,
she'll be able to hear again.

397
00:17:12,467 --> 00:17:14,248
Wait. You can restore
her hearing? Yeah.

398
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:17,237
But she's been deaf for years.
Yeah. She doesn't have to be.

399
00:17:17,415 --> 00:17:19,439
Just because you removed the bone?
What'd I just say?

400
00:17:19,704 --> 00:17:21,381
She doesn't have
to be deaf anymore.

401
00:17:22,435 --> 00:17:24,488
I can fix it. I'm that good.

402
00:17:25,188 --> 00:17:26,153
You still want to fire me?

403
00:17:31,042 --> 00:17:33,093
Not a bad looking bowel,
is it, webber?

404
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,340
No, sir. If I had to guess,

405
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:37,818
I would say it was the
bowel of a 50 year old.

406
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,425
Suction, dr. Grey.

407
00:17:40,479 --> 00:17:43,870
Dr. Grey, I've got
a question for you.

408
00:17:45,063 --> 00:17:46,198
It's of a personal nature.

409
00:17:46,772 --> 00:17:47,344
Yes, sir?

410
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,530
If your mother was
still working here,

411
00:17:51,614 --> 00:17:52,936
Would you have chosen to, uh,

412
00:17:53,499 --> 00:17:56,919
Study at a-a different,
lesser quality hospital

413
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:59,858
In order to avoid the
advantages of her legacy?

414
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:04,622
I'm waiting here, dr. Grey.

415
00:18:06,581 --> 00:18:07,970
Um... dr. Webber,

416
00:18:08,429 --> 00:18:09,922
What do you think about
intraoperational dye

417
00:18:10,147 --> 00:18:12,571
To help determine
intestinal viability?

418
00:18:13,434 --> 00:18:16,322
Uh, well, they say that it
enhances clinical judgment.

419
00:18:16,487 --> 00:18:18,763
I'm not real sure. I don't get it.

420
00:18:18,913 --> 00:18:19,818
Why does he get to scrub in

421
00:18:19,953 --> 00:18:22,085
On his own grandfather's
awake surgery?

422
00:18:22,085 --> 00:18:25,126
The same reason why harper
avery personally requested

423
00:18:25,126 --> 00:18:26,873
Meredith grey to be his resident.

424
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:28,342
Nepotism sucks.

425
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:33,066
Hey, you, uh,
want to go grab a bite?

426
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:34,819
No.

427
00:18:35,223 --> 00:18:37,845
Actually, I am... full.

428
00:18:38,321 --> 00:18:40,255
Really? 'cause you didn't
seem full last night.

429
00:18:40,423 --> 00:18:41,692
I said no.

430
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,907
Okay, I-I-I am not hungry at all.

431
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:46,221
So just go eat alone.

432
00:18:47,306 --> 00:18:49,196
Excuse me. Sorry.

433
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,692
Hey, down in front, bigfoot.

434
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,918
Oh, it's bigfoot now.

435
00:18:59,557 --> 00:19:02,034
Well, you know what they say
about guys with big feet.

436
00:19:02,582 --> 00:19:04,823
Shouldn't you be off
learning how to be a surgeon

437
00:19:05,054 --> 00:19:06,826
After you let my daredevil die?

438
00:19:07,055 --> 00:19:09,594
My daredevil? He didn't die.

439
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:10,769
After you left,

440
00:19:10,769 --> 00:19:12,969
I personally helped
preserve his heart function.

441
00:19:13,108 --> 00:19:14,221
Now he's an organ donor.

442
00:19:28,232 --> 00:19:29,300
B.P.'s DROPPING.

443
00:19:29,464 --> 00:19:30,885
I think I've got a bleeder.
Suction.

444
00:19:31,101 --> 00:19:34,721
Did you check the s.M.A.
? Yes, it's okay. Dr. Avery, stay calm.

445
00:19:34,865 --> 00:19:37,065
I'll be calm when you
find the damn thing.

446
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:43,424
What's going on, kathy?

447
00:19:44,886 --> 00:19:45,949
You're serious?

448
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:48,366
All this time, I just needed
to make her go to the doctor?

449
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:49,588
Well, that doesn't matter now.

450
00:19:49,728 --> 00:19:51,361
What matters is that dr.
Sloan can do the surgery

451
00:19:51,498 --> 00:19:52,554
Right after I operate on the knee.

452
00:19:53,491 --> 00:19:54,356
That accident might
have been the best thing

453
00:19:54,356 --> 00:19:55,379
That ever happened to you.

454
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:56,791
What's going on?

455
00:19:57,179 --> 00:19:58,006
Who are you?

456
00:19:59,155 --> 00:20:01,810
You're like some miracle
worker or something.

457
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:04,529
Thank you.

458
00:20:05,494 --> 00:20:06,648
Thank you so much.

459
00:20:08,188 --> 00:20:10,257
What the hell is going on?

460
00:20:10,601 --> 00:20:11,625
Mom...

461
00:20:12,137 --> 00:20:14,980
Dr. Sloan can give you
your hearing back!

462
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,239
Don't you dare sleep
with that woman. No?

463
00:20:17,404 --> 00:20:18,574
What?! No.

464
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,816
Dr. Sloan, come and
tell her yourself.

465
00:20:26,735 --> 00:20:27,851
Mrs. Nelson!

466
00:20:29,113 --> 00:20:33,809
I'm dr. Sloan! I have some
very good news for you!

467
00:20:35,391 --> 00:20:36,135
Okay, shouldn't we put him out?

468
00:20:36,376 --> 00:20:39,212
No, don't put me out.
Hang another unit of f.F.P.

469
00:20:40,095 --> 00:20:44,179
80 over 50. There it is.
There it is. I've got it.

470
00:20:45,326 --> 00:20:46,185
I've got it.

471
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:48,441
Okay.

472
00:20:49,643 --> 00:20:50,707
How are you feeling, dr. Avery?

473
00:20:52,135 --> 00:20:55,108
Okay. Heart rate's stabilizing.

474
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,165
Hang in there just a
few more minutes, okay?

475
00:20:58,568 --> 00:21:00,171
3-0 silk, boki. Silk?

476
00:21:01,067 --> 00:21:04,638
No, use chromic.
Don't get lazy on me.

477
00:21:05,112 --> 00:21:06,328
Yep, he's fine.

478
00:21:11,387 --> 00:21:12,229
Right.

479
00:21:13,163 --> 00:21:14,340
Chromic instead, boki.

480
00:21:17,611 --> 00:21:18,550
You paged?

481
00:21:20,847 --> 00:21:23,364
Oh, my god. Are you doing
an ex vivo lung repair?

482
00:21:23,525 --> 00:21:26,199
My daredevil turned out to be a match.
You stole his lungs?

483
00:21:26,516 --> 00:21:28,000
No, I did not steal them.

484
00:21:28,532 --> 00:21:29,996
The transplant team rejected them

485
00:21:30,195 --> 00:21:31,476
And were gonna send
them to medical waste,

486
00:21:31,668 --> 00:21:34,434
So I just redirected
them to medical research.

487
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,292
Now does lexopedia
want to be badass

488
00:21:36,467 --> 00:21:39,498
And help me on this thing or not?
Oh, my god. Yeah.

489
00:21:40,238 --> 00:21:42,091
Okay, so I ventilated the lungs

490
00:21:42,315 --> 00:21:44,647
With, uh, c-o-2 and
nitrogen from the pump.

491
00:21:46,091 --> 00:21:47,479
Hey. Hey.

492
00:21:49,097 --> 00:21:50,579
Um, you hear about harper-
I heard about your motorcycle--oh.

493
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:52,328
You go. No. Sorry. You go.

494
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,284
Uh, I was just gonna say,
it's kinda cool,

495
00:21:55,431 --> 00:21:59,057
Uh, harper avery being here.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it is.

496
00:22:00,082 --> 00:22:01,674
And, uh, uh,
your-- your motorcycle guy?

497
00:22:01,867 --> 00:22:03,490
Oh, we lost him, but he's a donor.

498
00:22:03,785 --> 00:22:04,671
Well, that's good.

499
00:22:09,011 --> 00:22:10,640
You know, you should come
over sometime for dinner.

500
00:22:10,808 --> 00:22:13,364
Uh, cristina--she-- well,
she doesn't cook,

501
00:22:13,523 --> 00:22:16,443
But if you remember,
I do a mean lasagna.

502
00:22:18,162 --> 00:22:19,329
Sure. Really?

503
00:22:19,618 --> 00:22:20,603
Yeah, yeah. Sounds fun.

504
00:22:22,157 --> 00:22:22,783
Okay.

505
00:22:25,924 --> 00:22:27,688
Uh, I gotta go. All right, yeah.

506
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:28,982
Uh, talk to you later. Mm-hmm.

507
00:22:29,843 --> 00:22:32,007
Okay, I know you love yang.

508
00:22:32,189 --> 00:22:33,731
She gives you the warm and fuzzies

509
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,776
With her magical,
special heart skills.

510
00:22:36,941 --> 00:22:38,411
But those lungs
you're transplanting

511
00:22:38,651 --> 00:22:39,829
Belonged to a patient of mine.

512
00:22:40,045 --> 00:22:41,616
And it would mean a
lot to turn his death

513
00:22:41,766 --> 00:22:44,605
Into something meaningful-
I'm sorry. What lungs?

514
00:22:45,622 --> 00:22:47,408
You went behind my back.
You used my name.

515
00:22:47,584 --> 00:22:49,385
Yes, yes, but we
followed the protocol.

516
00:22:49,614 --> 00:22:51,877
We didn't tell the patient.
You stole lungs, cristina!

517
00:22:52,175 --> 00:22:54,815
Which they were about to throw out.
She was being green.

518
00:22:55,035 --> 00:22:56,299
Oh, well, great.
Then I don't have to worry

519
00:22:56,398 --> 00:22:58,071
About the thousands of
dollars that you spent

520
00:22:58,195 --> 00:22:59,858
And the fact that no
one in this hospital

521
00:23:00,026 --> 00:23:01,175
Has ever tried this before.

522
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:07,791
Oh, my god. This is about
harper avery, isn't it?

523
00:23:08,082 --> 00:23:08,871
That's why you did this?

524
00:23:09,565 --> 00:23:11,252
Why is that such a bad thing?

525
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:12,315
Okay, the point is,
is that we could--

526
00:23:12,444 --> 00:23:15,588
You can pull this surgery off.
Oh, wow, thank you.

527
00:23:15,866 --> 00:23:17,682
I mean, who needs a harper
avery when they've got

528
00:23:17,682 --> 00:23:19,088
The cristina yang seal of approval?

529
00:23:19,218 --> 00:23:20,050
That's not what I was saying.

530
00:23:20,234 --> 00:23:21,310
All of this ambition of yours,

531
00:23:21,477 --> 00:23:24,086
This desperate need to win prizes,

532
00:23:24,564 --> 00:23:26,373
It means your
priorities are off. Hey.

533
00:23:26,561 --> 00:23:28,034
It doesn't. Prizes
push us to be better.

534
00:23:28,215 --> 00:23:29,284
They push us to be monsters.

535
00:23:29,479 --> 00:23:31,793
Hey. Oh, so the status quo-
not trying then--that's worse.

536
00:23:31,918 --> 00:23:35,745
Hey! The lungs--look.
They're--they're viable.

537
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,231
A transplant th repaired lungs

538
00:23:47,393 --> 00:23:49,165
Has never been done
in the united states.

539
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,224
The risks are tremendous,

540
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:53,713
And with the amount of
radiation that you sustained,

541
00:23:54,643 --> 00:23:56,778
There's no way of knowing
how friable your tissue is

542
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,908
Or if you can even
sustain a transplant.

543
00:23:58,908 --> 00:23:59,747
Wait. I'm sorry.

544
00:24:00,144 --> 00:24:02,736
Are you saying you recommend it,
though? No, they're saying

545
00:24:02,954 --> 00:24:04,842
They want to give us a pair
of hand-me-down lungs--

546
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:07,871
The ones no one else wants.
These are good lungs.

547
00:24:08,132 --> 00:24:10,230
This procedure has
allowed us to repair them

548
00:24:10,376 --> 00:24:13,476
So they're virtually the same as-
no! We'll wait.

549
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:17,316
We'll wait until you get
the lungs that you deserve.

550
00:24:19,818 --> 00:24:21,669
You're so used to fighting,
you don't even realize...

551
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:24,828
This is it.

552
00:24:26,409 --> 00:24:28,111
I am sick and I'm tired

553
00:24:28,308 --> 00:24:30,048
And I am ready.

554
00:24:32,986 --> 00:24:34,594
No matter what happens,
my affairs are in order.

555
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:38,229
Your affairs are not in order.
Don't you dare say that.

556
00:24:38,627 --> 00:24:40,165
Dr. Robbins, please.

557
00:24:41,884 --> 00:24:44,082
Is this my best shot?

558
00:24:46,842 --> 00:24:48,347
I'm not your surgeon here, elliot.

559
00:24:48,538 --> 00:24:49,830
I have to defer to dr. Altman.

560
00:24:56,033 --> 00:24:57,428
It's your only shot.

561
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:16,626
Then, yes. Do it.

562
00:25:18,818 --> 00:25:20,486
Give me the hand-me-downs.

563
00:25:35,161 --> 00:25:35,663
Dr. Sloan, good timing.

564
00:25:35,802 --> 00:25:37,189
Dr. Karev and I are
pretty much done.

565
00:25:37,545 --> 00:25:38,469
What the hell you looking at?

566
00:25:38,967 --> 00:25:39,939
Nothing, I was just--

567
00:25:40,098 --> 00:25:43,354
Get out of my o.R., karev.
Mark, you're way out of line here.

568
00:25:45,151 --> 00:25:45,852
It's fine. I'll go.

569
00:25:46,572 --> 00:25:47,306
He's got serial killer eyes.

570
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:49,505
I'm almost done here anyway.
You sure?

571
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:51,275
Yeah.

572
00:25:54,941 --> 00:25:55,705
That is enough.

573
00:25:55,882 --> 00:25:57,491
Hey, it's funny.
Did you see the guy's face?

574
00:25:57,717 --> 00:25:58,976
No, it is sad and pathetic.

575
00:25:59,327 --> 00:26:00,556
Okay? And you have a choice here.

576
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:02,978
Sloan and her baby leaving
you can either be the worst

577
00:26:03,131 --> 00:26:04,723
Or the best thing
that happened to you.

578
00:26:04,966 --> 00:26:07,323
You can grown up, find a woman
to love and have a baby.

579
00:26:07,538 --> 00:26:10,106
Or you can be the ass attending
who abuses the residents

580
00:26:10,271 --> 00:26:12,203
And screws whatever walks
into this hospital.

581
00:26:13,821 --> 00:26:14,643
So just pick one.

582
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:18,526
Would you drape the ear, please?

583
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:22,912
Look, it's not gonna happen,
all right?

584
00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:24,088
Come on, man. Five minutes
with your grandpappy.

585
00:26:24,243 --> 00:26:25,320
That's all I ask. Right,

586
00:26:25,734 --> 00:26:27,255
'cause the two of us
are such good friends.

587
00:26:27,512 --> 00:26:28,784
Well, this would go a
long way to help that.

588
00:26:28,935 --> 00:26:30,779
Back off, karev,
if anybody's a friend here,

589
00:26:30,952 --> 00:26:32,474
It's me. You're not
meeting him either.

590
00:26:32,745 --> 00:26:34,005
Dude, what happened
to mercy west forever?

591
00:26:34,214 --> 00:26:37,818
That was never a thing. Now leave.

592
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:48,381
I hate it.

593
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:50,577
I hate it when they know
I'm related to him--

594
00:26:51,544 --> 00:26:52,315
The way they treat me,

595
00:26:52,501 --> 00:26:54,618
The way they watch me as
soon as they find out.

596
00:26:56,037 --> 00:26:58,547
And I know the name has... helped,

597
00:26:59,195 --> 00:27:00,419
But he is not easy.

598
00:27:02,045 --> 00:27:04,813
Brilliant, but really not
easy to be related to.

599
00:27:10,697 --> 00:27:11,497
It's him. 9-1-1.

600
00:27:12,978 --> 00:27:14,278
What is it? You paged?

601
00:27:15,854 --> 00:27:16,417
Are you okay?

602
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:19,119
We never got a chance to finish
our talk from this morning.

603
00:27:19,436 --> 00:27:20,675
Our talk?

604
00:27:20,831 --> 00:27:22,225
What, are you kidding me?
And you brought dr.Grey.

605
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,730
That's good, actually.

606
00:27:24,901 --> 00:27:26,089
Answer me this time, dr. Grey.

607
00:27:27,219 --> 00:27:30,016
If a spot was being
held for you to study

608
00:27:30,166 --> 00:27:31,606
At the greatest hospital
in this country,

609
00:27:31,748 --> 00:27:32,697
Would you turn it down?

610
00:27:34,109 --> 00:27:35,810
A spot? Well--

611
00:27:36,273 --> 00:27:38,157
Yeah, he saved a spot
for me at mass gen,

612
00:27:38,449 --> 00:27:39,183
Ever since I graduated,

613
00:27:39,618 --> 00:27:40,627
Which is the only reason
he came to visit--

614
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,415
To try to convince
me to take it again.

615
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,320
It's an incredible opportunity.

616
00:27:44,471 --> 00:27:46,113
An opportunity I don't want.
I don't want to work for you.

617
00:27:46,411 --> 00:27:48,574
I don't want your help.
I don't--look,

618
00:27:48,765 --> 00:27:52,090
it's enough-- no!
I decide when I've said enough.

619
00:27:52,382 --> 00:27:56,060
I--you--you think I am
arrogant and overbearing,

620
00:27:56,344 --> 00:27:58,291
And you've made that very clear,
and maybe I am.

621
00:27:58,642 --> 00:28:01,593
But I am also your only
living grandfather.

622
00:28:01,879 --> 00:28:04,404
And it has become
very clear to me today

623
00:28:04,564 --> 00:28:05,550
That my time is coming.

624
00:28:05,943 --> 00:28:09,414
I don't--I can't l-leave-- leave--

625
00:28:09,414 --> 00:28:10,173
Grandpa? Grandpa?

626
00:28:11,338 --> 00:28:12,761
V-tach. No pulse. No pulse here.

627
00:28:12,945 --> 00:28:13,934
We need a crash cart in here. Now!

628
00:28:15,545 --> 00:28:17,563
Your c.T. Shows that the's
been a c complication.

629
00:28:17,814 --> 00:28:19,826
Dr. Webber will take
you back into the o.R.

630
00:28:20,756 --> 00:28:21,792
And fix it right away.

631
00:28:22,094 --> 00:28:25,714
Fine, but you're
not putting me out.

632
00:28:26,181 --> 00:28:27,817
Clearly a mistake was made.

633
00:28:27,982 --> 00:28:29,194
I'm not letting that happen again.

634
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:30,785
That's not gonna happen this time.

635
00:28:31,492 --> 00:28:34,233
You're in my hospital today.
You will abide by my rules.

636
00:28:34,932 --> 00:28:35,952
That means you go under general.

637
00:28:36,674 --> 00:28:39,079
Your grandson will be sitting
in the waiting room as family.

638
00:28:39,741 --> 00:28:42,948
You refuse, and I will
personally declare you unfit

639
00:28:43,344 --> 00:28:45,210
To make decisions
regarding your own care.

640
00:28:48,145 --> 00:28:49,452
That is how a chief does things.

641
00:28:49,697 --> 00:28:50,543
Take note.

642
00:28:54,742 --> 00:28:57,331
Have bailey do the surgery.
Richard--

643
00:28:57,629 --> 00:28:59,334
Look, it could've been my
mistake in there, derek.

644
00:29:00,388 --> 00:29:01,985
Do you understand
what this would mean,

645
00:29:02,885 --> 00:29:04,026
Making an error on this man?

646
00:29:06,847 --> 00:29:07,563
I wanna drink,

647
00:29:08,744 --> 00:29:11,646
Not operate, not hold another
man's life in my hands.

648
00:29:12,567 --> 00:29:14,806
So please... let bailey do it.

649
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:17,998
Bailey will assist.

650
00:29:19,942 --> 00:29:20,756
Two months ago,

651
00:29:20,756 --> 00:29:22,173
You never would've told
me you wanted a drink.

652
00:29:22,931 --> 00:29:23,827
You woulda had one.

653
00:29:25,925 --> 00:29:26,811
You can do this, richard.

654
00:29:34,495 --> 00:29:35,161
I get it.

655
00:29:35,814 --> 00:29:38,259
You got used to being the one
person she could count on.

656
00:29:40,189 --> 00:29:43,555
And suddenly, you're
supposed to just move on,

657
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:46,710
Get a life that doesn't involve

658
00:29:46,906 --> 00:29:49,081
Taking care of the one person
you thought needed you.

659
00:29:50,214 --> 00:29:50,899
It's hard.

660
00:29:51,605 --> 00:29:52,263
Okay.

661
00:29:53,514 --> 00:29:54,333
Yeah.

662
00:29:56,019 --> 00:29:58,660
Except, no, I am not gonna
miss taking care of her.

663
00:29:59,797 --> 00:30:03,229
I wasted years of my
life and I was miserable.

664
00:30:04,065 --> 00:30:04,934
But now...

665
00:30:07,721 --> 00:30:08,815
I can do anything.

666
00:30:11,127 --> 00:30:11,751
Right?I mean,

667
00:30:12,308 --> 00:30:13,955
I could... I could move out...

668
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,448
Get my own place...

669
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:19,289
Have men over...

670
00:30:21,127 --> 00:30:22,881
Men that look like you.

671
00:30:25,485 --> 00:30:28,065
I was taking care of you,
you little tramp.

672
00:30:30,005 --> 00:30:30,764
Mom?

673
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:34,227
No one asked you to move in.

674
00:30:35,525 --> 00:30:37,225
You were getting a divorce.

675
00:30:37,576 --> 00:30:39,783
You had no place to go.
So you came home.

676
00:30:41,301 --> 00:30:42,832
I didn't need you
to take care of me.

677
00:30:42,994 --> 00:30:44,447
I was fine, happy.

678
00:30:45,837 --> 00:30:49,072
But I let you, because I
was taking care of you.

679
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:52,213
You heard all that?

680
00:30:55,184 --> 00:30:56,558
Mom, you can hear.

681
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,389
I can? Yeah.

682
00:31:00,906 --> 00:31:03,221
Oh, my god. I can. I can!

683
00:31:03,568 --> 00:31:05,136
Say something. Say something else.

684
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:06,958
Okay, uh...

685
00:31:08,334 --> 00:31:09,371
I'm moving out, mom.

686
00:31:10,219 --> 00:31:11,373
I heard that.

687
00:31:13,335 --> 00:31:14,155
Oh, sorry.

688
00:31:21,582 --> 00:31:22,301
Damn it.

689
00:31:22,301 --> 00:31:23,000
What is it?

690
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,672
The tissue is falling apart.
The clamp's not holding.

691
00:31:28,432 --> 00:31:29,370
Get me some umbilical tape.

692
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:34,842
This is why I hate awards.
They don't make us better,

693
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:37,700
Just more competitive and stupid.
And for what?

694
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:40,142
To put on a dress and
eat a bad piece of fish

695
00:31:40,855 --> 00:31:42,829
And take home an ugly paperweight

696
00:31:42,998 --> 00:31:43,837
That's gonna sit on your mantel

697
00:31:43,987 --> 00:31:47,108
For the rest of your sad,
empty, misguided life.

698
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:49,752
You could do an interposition
vein graft. What?

699
00:31:50,813 --> 00:31:52,035
You have something to add,
dr. Yang?

700
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:53,200
No, just...

701
00:31:56,064 --> 00:31:56,992
You've already gotten this far.

702
00:31:57,157 --> 00:31:58,694
You could repair the p.
A. With a graft.

703
00:31:59,642 --> 00:32:00,334
Maybe.

704
00:32:01,382 --> 00:32:01,970
No.

705
00:32:06,435 --> 00:32:07,380
I could do a pericardial patch.

706
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,968
I could use his pericardium
to do the repair.

707
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,031
We could start cooling him.

708
00:32:11,215 --> 00:32:12,939
And arrest the heart.
How are we doing on time, grey?

709
00:32:13,163 --> 00:32:15,157
Cold ischemic time-
three hours so far.

710
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:17,097
Which means that we
still have enough time

711
00:32:17,206 --> 00:32:18,306
To save the lungs if we hurry.

712
00:32:19,517 --> 00:32:20,521
All right, yang,
get in there and help me.

713
00:32:21,037 --> 00:32:21,654
Clamp.

714
00:32:21,923 --> 00:32:22,686
Good. Here we go.

715
00:32:41,775 --> 00:32:44,405
His bowels are all
swollen and hardened.

716
00:32:44,611 --> 00:32:46,055
The anastomosis is leaking.

717
00:32:46,951 --> 00:32:48,619
Which explains why
he went into shock.

718
00:32:48,981 --> 00:32:51,543
All in all, I'd say this
is about the best news

719
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:54,689
We could've asked for, dr.
Webber. I don't understand.

720
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:57,013
His bowels are perforated.
He's leaking intestinal contents.

721
00:32:57,297 --> 00:33:01,002
Because dr. Avery was allergic
to the chromic suture.

722
00:33:01,516 --> 00:33:03,708
He didn't know because he
was always wearing gloves

723
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:04,862
In his own surgeries.

724
00:33:06,161 --> 00:33:07,393
And you couldn't
have known either--

725
00:33:07,588 --> 00:33:10,183
Which is why I am smiling
behind this mask.

726
00:33:13,542 --> 00:33:15,591
Get the 3-0 silk ready, boki.

727
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:24,994
Okay. This is it.

728
00:33:26,355 --> 00:33:27,074
Let's take him off bypass

729
00:33:27,211 --> 00:33:28,722
And see if these lungs
can work on their own.

730
00:33:30,534 --> 00:33:31,590
Clamping.

731
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,131
There.

732
00:33:42,384 --> 00:33:43,951
Come on. Breathe.

733
00:33:47,285 --> 00:33:48,550
Breathe.

734
00:33:48,813 --> 00:33:49,699
Breathe, damn it.

735
00:34:05,583 --> 00:34:07,363
I just spent the past five hours

736
00:34:07,501 --> 00:34:09,537
Trying to be okay with the fact

737
00:34:09,691 --> 00:34:11,939
That my only brother was dead.

738
00:34:14,197 --> 00:34:15,604
And... Now you're saying it worked?

739
00:34:15,999 --> 00:34:16,936
He's gonna be okay?

740
00:34:17,524 --> 00:34:18,590
Barring any complications.

741
00:34:18,754 --> 00:34:20,055
He's gonna be okay, yes.

742
00:34:23,207 --> 00:34:24,004
Would you like to see him?

743
00:34:25,265 --> 00:34:25,912
Yeah.

744
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,616
Okay, come on.

745
00:34:36,286 --> 00:34:37,685
Hey. So he's fine.

746
00:34:37,885 --> 00:34:39,814
It was an allergy
caused by the suture.

747
00:34:40,529 --> 00:34:41,337
It was his fault, then?

748
00:34:43,108 --> 00:34:43,699
Wow.

749
00:34:44,792 --> 00:34:45,747
That's awesome.

750
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,290
Why don't they publish that story?

751
00:34:49,261 --> 00:34:51,029
Yeah, I know. I get it.

752
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:51,825
The famous grandfather,

753
00:34:52,166 --> 00:34:53,614
The legacy he's trying
to force on you,

754
00:34:53,943 --> 00:34:56,395
And you didn't ask for any of it-
-trust me, I get it.

755
00:34:57,133 --> 00:34:58,822
You're putting up walls
and you're avoiding him

756
00:34:58,995 --> 00:35:00,662
And you don't want to
introduce him to your friends.

757
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,345
It was the same with my mother.

758
00:35:04,304 --> 00:35:06,450
But if she were here right
now in a room upstairs,

759
00:35:06,736 --> 00:35:09,043
I would want to go see her and
make things right with her.

760
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:12,396
And I definitely would
want to go learn from her.

761
00:35:13,871 --> 00:35:14,690
And you still can.

762
00:35:27,072 --> 00:35:28,783
Guess who just helped
save a guy's life

763
00:35:28,962 --> 00:35:30,853
By suggesting a
highly experimental,

764
00:35:31,139 --> 00:35:33,688
Awesome procedure--
did you tell sloan we were together?

765
00:35:35,005 --> 00:35:35,677
What?

766
00:35:35,976 --> 00:35:38,483
Look, I like you,
and you're a great time in bed,

767
00:35:38,647 --> 00:35:40,104
But don't go telling
your ex we're together

768
00:35:40,264 --> 00:35:41,343
So you can make him jealous.

769
00:35:43,698 --> 00:35:45,240
I did not tell mark
that we were together.

770
00:35:45,458 --> 00:35:47,665
And I am not trying to make
him jealous. Yeah, right.

771
00:35:47,849 --> 00:35:49,666
I'M GETTING KICKED OUT OF O.
R.S FOR A REASON.

772
00:35:50,436 --> 00:35:52,355
For once in my life-- for once--

773
00:35:52,615 --> 00:35:54,446
I am doing something
that is only for me.

774
00:35:54,793 --> 00:35:57,851
And it has nothing to do with
me having feelings for you

775
00:35:58,046 --> 00:36:00,651
Or for mark or anyone, really.

776
00:36:00,822 --> 00:36:02,290
This is about not feeling.

777
00:36:03,249 --> 00:36:04,222
You make me not feel.

778
00:36:05,153 --> 00:36:05,891
A-and if you can't handle that,

779
00:36:06,174 --> 00:36:07,859
If you can't handle
being used for sex,

780
00:36:08,036 --> 00:36:10,917
Then please just tell me so
that I can find a guy who can.

781
00:36:14,391 --> 00:36:15,385
I'm all about not feeling.

782
00:36:19,031 --> 00:36:20,704
You've been through a lot. I-I--

783
00:36:20,843 --> 00:36:21,714
Look, don't get all mushy on me.

784
00:36:21,877 --> 00:36:23,067
I'm just saying,
we're on the same page.

785
00:36:24,584 --> 00:36:25,480
And I got a free 20 minutes.

786
00:36:27,271 --> 00:36:28,535
You want to go not have
feelings somewhere?

787
00:36:43,507 --> 00:36:45,328
It's really bad form to
cancel plans with new friends.

788
00:36:46,071 --> 00:36:46,847
You know that, right?

789
00:36:51,429 --> 00:36:52,433
I'll meet you in 15.

790
00:36:56,801 --> 00:37:00,488
So, uh, I heard about
the lung transplant.

791
00:37:03,946 --> 00:37:05,117
Cristina said that
you were amazing.

792
00:37:05,369 --> 00:37:07,059
No, cristina was amazing.

793
00:37:11,125 --> 00:37:12,626
aaaaaaaaa

794
00:37:17,771 --> 00:37:19,991
Want to grab a beer, celebrate?

795
00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:21,348
I was gonna head to joe's.

796
00:37:22,231 --> 00:37:23,240
I've got plans, actually.

797
00:37:24,321 --> 00:37:25,000
Ladies' night.

798
00:37:25,651 --> 00:37:26,956
I'm--I'm a little scared.

799
00:37:30,416 --> 00:37:31,138
I'll see you tomorrow, hunt.

800
00:37:32,842 --> 00:37:35,511
No matter how many plans we
make or steps we follow...

801
00:37:36,347 --> 00:37:37,403
See you tomorrow.

802
00:37:37,827 --> 00:37:39,379
We never know how our
day is going to end up.

803
00:37:41,154 --> 00:37:42,378
We'd prefer to know, of course,

804
00:37:42,759 --> 00:37:44,544
What curve balls will
be thrown our way.

805
00:37:44,875 --> 00:37:45,625
Karev!

806
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:48,893
Look, dude,
she's not my girlfriend.

807
00:37:49,197 --> 00:37:51,760
So whatever business you two
have to work out-- I'll stop.

808
00:37:52,267 --> 00:37:54,492
THE YELLING, THE THROWING
YOU OUT OF O.R.S, IT'S OVER.

809
00:38:24,107 --> 00:38:25,793
It's the accidents that
always turn out to be

810
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:27,693
The most interesting
parts of our day,

811
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:30,641
Of life...

812
00:38:31,879 --> 00:38:35,023
How's your regenerative
medicine research going?

813
00:38:36,136 --> 00:38:39,020
Oh, I put it on the
shelf a few years back.

814
00:38:40,631 --> 00:38:42,163
I got preoccupied.

815
00:38:46,466 --> 00:38:48,945
That research put you
on the short list

816
00:38:49,134 --> 00:38:50,977
For my award several times, webber.

817
00:38:53,084 --> 00:38:54,446
Maybe it's time to dust it off.

818
00:38:57,451 --> 00:38:58,413
Maybe it is.

819
00:39:00,382 --> 00:39:02,103
The people we never
expected to show up...

820
00:39:05,819 --> 00:39:06,340
Grandpa.

821
00:39:06,525 --> 00:39:10,624
I, um, wanted to introduce
you to some friends

822
00:39:11,139 --> 00:39:11,972
If you feel up for it.

823
00:39:15,072 --> 00:39:15,887
Bring 'em in.

824
00:39:18,675 --> 00:39:20,371
All right. Hurry up. Come on.

825
00:39:21,174 --> 00:39:21,833
We met, um, uh... oh, yeah.

826
00:39:22,101 --> 00:39:24,917
Already this morning,
and I, um, you were--

827
00:39:25,103 --> 00:39:26,726
I was... spit it out, yang.

828
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:28,140
There was, uh, so much going on.

829
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:31,306
Start with your name,
and we'll go from there.

830
00:39:31,445 --> 00:39:32,974
Cristina yang.
It's, uh, it's an honor,

831
00:39:33,112 --> 00:39:33,997
sir. It's, um-- it's nice to...

832
00:39:34,327 --> 00:39:36,836
Thank you so much.
Officially meet you, dr. Yang.

833
00:39:37,287 --> 00:39:38,754
And the rest of you? Uh,
lexie grey.

834
00:39:38,924 --> 00:39:41,752
The turn of events we never
would've chosen for ourselves.

835
00:39:42,169 --> 00:39:43,414
You won't make that. I'll make it.

836
00:39:43,582 --> 00:39:45,515
I told off one of my heroes today.
I can do anything.

837
00:39:47,773 --> 00:39:50,085
You know, teddy did an ex
vivo lung repair today.

838
00:39:50,266 --> 00:39:51,263
That's pretty incredible.

839
00:39:54,013 --> 00:39:56,202
I slept with my patient's
daughter just now,

840
00:39:56,962 --> 00:39:58,530
After restoring her
mother's hearing.

841
00:39:58,732 --> 00:39:59,522
Don't worry, derek.

842
00:40:00,145 --> 00:40:01,653
I promise never to do it again.

843
00:40:03,759 --> 00:40:04,692
Wow. We suck.

844
00:40:06,916 --> 00:40:07,801
They were just leaving.

845
00:40:08,032 --> 00:40:09,259
We were? Yeah.

846
00:40:09,998 --> 00:40:11,598
Right. We were.

847
00:40:12,938 --> 00:40:14,196
Night, webber.

848
00:40:15,789 --> 00:40:16,610
Uh... good night.

849
00:40:22,229 --> 00:40:23,746
I had to pee in a cup today, derek.

850
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:28,735
I had to pee in a cup,
and... it was humiliating.

851
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:30,520
And what I did today--

852
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:33,261
Agreeing to the awake surgery--

853
00:40:33,503 --> 00:40:34,726
I know I overstepped, but...

854
00:40:37,637 --> 00:40:40,550
I needed to feel something
other than humiliated.

855
00:40:40,944 --> 00:40:41,857
I understand.

856
00:40:43,584 --> 00:40:44,819
Tomorrow's another day.

857
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:48,138
Thanks.

858
00:40:48,917 --> 00:40:49,664
All of a sudden,

859
00:40:49,854 --> 00:40:52,573
You find yourself somewhere
you never expected to be,

860
00:40:53,654 --> 00:40:54,476
And it's nice...

861
00:40:58,031 --> 00:40:59,718
Or it takes some getting used to.

862
00:40:59,941 --> 00:41:01,823
Why couldn't we have gone
dancing for girls' night...

863
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,951
Or bowling?

864
00:41:04,214 --> 00:41:06,483
We took a vote. You lost.

865
00:41:06,913 --> 00:41:08,395
Besides, it's fun.

866
00:41:09,029 --> 00:41:09,832
Mm. Says who?

867
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:11,444
Bailey's face. Look at it.

868
00:41:11,742 --> 00:41:14,246
Go, go, go.
Come on, come on, come on.

869
00:41:16,189 --> 00:41:18,291
Aah! That's all right.
That's all right.

870
00:41:18,498 --> 00:41:21,155
Still, you know you'll find
yourself appreciating it

871
00:41:21,311 --> 00:41:22,315
Somewhere down the line.

872
00:41:23,107 --> 00:41:24,122
You know, I'm in love with teddy.

873
00:41:24,573 --> 00:41:26,560
I love her. You're like lexie

874
00:41:26,708 --> 00:41:28,637
With the inappropriate feelings
for inappropriate people.

875
00:41:30,094 --> 00:41:30,816
What can I say?

876
00:41:32,102 --> 00:41:32,818
My heart lives in my scalpel.

877
00:41:34,122 --> 00:41:36,570
Those were trick balls.
Bailey, you just gotta be taller.

878
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:38,364
I gotta... girl, you know what?

879
00:41:38,542 --> 00:41:40,254
So you go to sleep each night
thinking about tomorrow...

880
00:41:43,343 --> 00:41:44,702
That's what I'm talking
about! Oh, yes!

881
00:41:44,967 --> 00:41:48,355
Beat that, yang! Oh, no.
It's teddy's turn.

882
00:41:48,802 --> 00:41:51,317
Going over your plans... it's
gonna feel great when you connect.

883
00:41:51,522 --> 00:41:52,323
Preparing the lists...

884
00:41:52,563 --> 00:41:53,972
it's like making your
first incision. Take it.

885
00:41:54,578 --> 00:41:56,905
It's just you,
the bat and the ball.

886
00:41:57,185 --> 00:41:58,778
Yeah, I'm a badass chick, cristina.

887
00:41:59,238 --> 00:42:01,606
I've swung a bat before.
Okay, let's see it. Let's see it.

888
00:42:01,778 --> 00:42:04,228
And hoping that whatever accidents
come your way... you ready?

889
00:42:08,168 --> 00:42:10,699
Will be happy ones.

890
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:17,700
