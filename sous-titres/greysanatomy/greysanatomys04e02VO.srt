1
00:00:00,685 --> 00:00:02,278
<i>Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy...

2
00:00:02,398 --> 00:00:04,779
- He's gone.
- It's over...

3
00:00:05,023 --> 00:00:06,498
So over.

4
00:00:06,652 --> 00:00:08,949
Dr. Burke handed in
his letter of resignation

5
00:00:09,136 --> 00:00:11,129
- two weeks ago.
- I was named chief resident.

6
00:00:11,306 --> 00:00:13,540
I would've made
an excellent chief resident.

7
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:15,835
- We're breaking up.
- A breakup kiss.

8
00:00:16,098 --> 00:00:17,450
A breakup kiss.

9
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:20,591
I'm lexie. Lexie grey.
I'm your sister.

10
00:00:20,756 --> 00:00:22,211
Why are you avoiding me?

11
00:00:22,394 --> 00:00:24,923
I'm all alone in a forest,
all alone in the forest, George.

12
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:26,444
Where are you?

13
00:00:27,075 --> 00:00:28,221
I love you, too.

14
00:00:34,995 --> 00:00:37,436
<i>In the hospital,
we see addiction every day.</i>

15
00:00:38,146 --> 00:00:39,940
I feel this, uh, this...

16
00:00:40,596 --> 00:00:44,031
this exhalaration.
It's like I finally figured it out.

17
00:00:44,287 --> 00:00:46,382
You know what it's like?
It's like I was sleeping,

18
00:00:46,502 --> 00:00:49,108
and it's like I woke up.
And it's just...

19
00:00:50,228 --> 00:00:51,655
It's just amazing.

20
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:56,360
<i>It's shocking how many
kinds of addiction exist.</i>

21
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,989
This is the best breakup ever.

22
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:00,388
I don't know why we didn't
break up a long time ago.

23
00:01:00,696 --> 00:01:02,621
- What are you doing?
- Sleeping.

24
00:01:02,997 --> 00:01:06,425
- No. No sleepovers.
- Yes, please. It's 3:00 in the morning.

25
00:01:06,611 --> 00:01:09,236
We agreed. No sleepovers.
Broken up people don't sleep over.

26
00:01:09,356 --> 00:01:11,546
Sex only. It's the only part
of the relationship that works.

27
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:13,419
I know. Why screw it up
with everything else?

28
00:01:13,539 --> 00:01:15,195
Dinner, conversations.

29
00:01:15,315 --> 00:01:18,111
You're mocking my severe
emotional limitations.

30
00:01:18,231 --> 00:01:21,562
I could live without conversation.
I could live without meal or sleepovers.

31
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:23,895
We shouldn't have sleepovers
because you snore.

32
00:01:25,825 --> 00:01:28,576
But mockery? Mockery, that's the XXX.

33
00:01:28,754 --> 00:01:30,698
Okay, sex and mockery it is.

34
00:01:31,202 --> 00:01:33,374
<i>It would be too easy
if it was just drugs</i>

35
00:01:33,557 --> 00:01:35,205
<i>and booze and cigarettes.</i>

36
00:01:35,325 --> 00:01:37,583
She said she loved me,
and you know,

37
00:01:37,761 --> 00:01:39,533
my dad, he c--
Oh, god, he loved her.

38
00:01:39,653 --> 00:01:42,331
And you know,
when he died then...

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,587
I shouldn't have gotten married.

40
00:01:50,581 --> 00:01:54,430
<i>I think the hardest part of kicking
a habit is wanting to kick it.</i>

41
00:01:56,173 --> 00:02:00,032
<i>I mean, we get addicted
for a reason, right?</i>

42
00:02:14,398 --> 00:02:16,272
I thought it was right,
but it wasn't.

43
00:02:16,392 --> 00:02:17,797
- It's not.
- It's not.

44
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:20,972
<i>Often, too often...</i>

45
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:23,600
<i>things that start out
as just a normal part of your life</i>

46
00:02:23,837 --> 00:02:27,171
<i>at some point cross the line
to obsessive...</i>

47
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,171
<i>compulsive...</i>

48
00:02:29,491 --> 00:02:31,171
- <i>...out of control.</i>
- I...

49
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,814
I gotta tell her.

50
00:02:33,836 --> 00:02:35,582
I have to tell her
the marriage is over.

51
00:02:36,132 --> 00:02:37,573
It's the right thing to do.

52
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,566
Did you see how I walked
out of here all determined?

53
00:02:48,994 --> 00:02:50,294
It made me proud.

54
00:02:53,016 --> 00:02:54,791
<i>It's the high we're chasing,</i>

55
00:02:55,712 --> 00:02:58,022
<i>the high that makes
everything else...</i>

56
00:02:59,648 --> 00:03:00,799
<i>fade away.</i>

57
00:03:01,062 --> 00:03:02,376
He loves me, too.

58
00:03:03,888 --> 00:03:06,358
- What do you think of the board?
- Good. It looks good.

59
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:08,378
- Did a good job.
- I didn't do it.

60
00:03:08,838 --> 00:03:11,552
I'm delegating.
I am being a delegator.

61
00:03:11,867 --> 00:03:14,726
I'm doing it all different,
making time for my wife.

62
00:03:14,901 --> 00:03:16,479
Yeah? She talking to you yet?

63
00:03:16,648 --> 00:03:18,873
She will when she sees
I'm a delegator.

64
00:03:19,682 --> 00:03:22,645
- I should move that surgery up there.
- Junkie.

65
00:03:23,847 --> 00:03:25,437
Right. It's good.
That's fine.

66
00:03:25,634 --> 00:03:27,336
Okay. I'm delegating.

67
00:03:27,809 --> 00:03:29,212
Being a delegator.

68
00:03:32,025 --> 00:03:34,209
- What's wrong with the chief?
- He's a junkie.

69
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:37,074
Him? You're the one
who looks all strung out.

70
00:03:37,243 --> 00:03:38,878
- I'm just tired.
- Let me guess.

71
00:03:39,055 --> 00:03:42,454
You are back together, and you've been
up all night doing the horizontal salsa.

72
00:03:42,642 --> 00:03:44,660
Mambo. Horizontal mambo.

73
00:03:44,876 --> 00:03:46,552
Meredith and I, we're justriends.

74
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,177
Sexy friends?

75
00:03:49,297 --> 00:03:51,573
You're the worst, most juvenile
human being I've ever met.

76
00:03:51,693 --> 00:03:54,388
You know the first step to recovery
is admitting you have a problem?

77
00:03:54,508 --> 00:03:56,661
How many nurses have
you slept with this week?

78
00:03:56,876 --> 00:03:58,970
That's not a problem, man.
That's an adventure.

79
00:04:02,258 --> 00:04:04,989
- it is beautiful.
- I know. It's a belgian flip round pro.

80
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:06,376
- What do you want?
- What do you got?

81
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,856
Next time I get a projectile vomiter,
I could lose your pager number.

82
00:04:08,976 --> 00:04:11,779
You can do better than that.
Surgeries, baby. Preferably cardio.

83
00:04:12,783 --> 00:04:14,492
Are these all wedding gifts?

84
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:17,089
Yes. She's giving them away.
I have dibs on the mixmaster.

85
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:18,442
I'm not giving you the mixmaster.

86
00:04:18,562 --> 00:04:20,706
The tradition is
you're supposed to return them.

87
00:04:20,903 --> 00:04:22,936
Well, burke registered
for this crap.

88
00:04:23,056 --> 00:04:24,883
Now I'm the one stuck dealing with it.

89
00:04:25,212 --> 00:04:26,836
So i'm using it
for professional gain.

90
00:04:27,221 --> 00:04:29,976
- You're ready to part with this?
- She's not. I want it.

91
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:34,470
I am if I can help on the rhomboid
flap in your next mohs defect repair.

92
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,787
Come to daddy.

93
00:04:39,724 --> 00:04:41,904
- You steal this stuff?
- Make her give me something.

94
00:04:42,024 --> 00:04:43,940
- Give her something.
- Give me the mixmaster.

95
00:04:44,063 --> 00:04:46,213
Face it.
You have nothing I want.

96
00:04:46,354 --> 00:04:48,354
Would you look at the residents.

97
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:50,775
Big, snazzy residents,

98
00:04:50,953 --> 00:04:53,235
standing around
playing with housewares.

99
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:56,185
Turn a blind eye and
the soup tureen's yours.

100
00:05:00,755 --> 00:05:02,708
Four!
Take this mix!

101
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,669
Hey! Take the mixmaster

102
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:07,110
and all this crap and
put it in my locker.

103
00:05:09,717 --> 00:05:12,074
Carnage in the pit.
My day's improving.

104
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:17,404
Follow.

105
00:05:19,307 --> 00:05:20,523
We're not gonna round?

106
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,508
Carnage trumps rounds, three.
Write that down.

107
00:05:22,628 --> 00:05:23,953
Carnage always trumps rounds.

108
00:05:26,619 --> 00:05:28,822
Hey. I know.
I never made it home last night.

109
00:05:28,942 --> 00:05:32,093
But I got swamped with paperwork
and fell asleep in an on call room.

110
00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:34,938
I need to talk to you
when you have time.

111
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,630
I have no time. I'm out of time.

112
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,020
This chief resident
thing is kicking my ass.

113
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,600
Later, then. Tonight, when we're alone?

114
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:41,750
Is it serious?

115
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,420
what do we got?

116
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,570
A gas main blew in
an apartment building.

117
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:46,610
Five injured, some badly.

118
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:48,060
Excellent.

119
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,870
Horrible. It's horribl sad.

120
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:56,650
Marla kristler,34-year-old female,
abdomen blown out, skull fracture,

121
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:59,040
third-degree burns over
at least 40% of her body.

122
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,010
Okay, I got this. Open O. R. Two.

123
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,320
Page Dr. Shepherd.
Torres, triage the rest.

124
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,940
Yes, sir. Yang, you're with the chief.

125
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:05,750
- Go.
- Oh, thank you.

126
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:06,840
Uh, one, four, come with me.

127
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,990
what about us?

128
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:11,430
Uh... go help bailey in the clinic.

129
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,480
my wife--she came in in
another ambulance. Is she here?

130
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,330
- Where-- where'd they take her? -Yeah, yeah.
She'll be going straight to surgery.

131
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,850
- Sir, are you injured?
- No. My son!

132
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:25,710
18 months old,contusions,possible head
injury. B.P. And pulse are elevated.

133
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,540
karev!

134
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,440
- I'm supposed to be on plastics.
- I'll take it.

135
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,090
I called karev. You're
with the kristlers.

136
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,590
Wh-what about me?

137
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,840
oh, you up late last night?
You look a little tired.

138
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,860
Perhaps you should sit this one out.

139
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,010
I'm fine.

140
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:45,290
Not up late. Went to bed early.

141
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,020
- hello, mister...
- roche. Archie roche.

142
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:53,453
Age 60, second-and third-degree burns over chest and upper
abdomen, facial contusions and possible shoulder fracture.

143
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:58,840
One minute I'm reading the sports section, the next I'm flat on my back
looking up at a hole in the ceiling right into dave and marla's apartment.

144
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,790
These burns should be debrided
while he gets worked up.

145
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:03,230
All righT. We'll do a trauma
series and shoulder films.

146
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,280
- Stevens.
- Got it.

147
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,800
where's your pain?

148
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,400
Just promise me you'll take
care of marla and the baby, okay?

149
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,050
Are they your family, sir?

150
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,860
They might as well be.

151
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,950
how close to the explosion was he?

152
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:17,210
Oh, we were, uh, we were in the living
room, his mom was in the kitchen.

153
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,370
The gas line blew?

154
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,140
I-I think it was the stove.

155
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,900
All right, we're gonna run
some tests on your baby.

156
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,880
Kav, I'm going into surgery
with the chief. Keep me posted.

157
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,230
Marla and david are friends.

158
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,940
I was just leaving when the--
when the kitchen blew up.

159
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,200
The blast knocked me into a wall.

160
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,650
Have you seen this?

161
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,810
Grim.

162
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,130
You guys look grim.

163
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:44,470
Uh,clark,we need to get a C.T.

164
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,310
Internal bleeding?

165
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,410
I was on my way to work.

166
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,300
um, hey, I need a resident
to help me out in the clinic

167
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,790
to oversee the new interns
while I'm workinon this patient.

168
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:58,080
No, I'm sorry. I can't help.

169
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,170
You can't help?

170
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,400
The clinic is voluntary, bailey.

171
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,190
I'm not gonna force any residents to go in
there with this much going on in the pit,

172
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:07,590
but you can have as many
interns as you need, okay?

173
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,370
And tell Dr. Kent he's gotta
find himself another O.R.

174
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,000
The chief's taking his.

175
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,020
I want the waffle maker.

176
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,000
Haven't we already covered this?

177
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,220
Yeah, but now I got something you want.

178
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,500
Oh, yeah? What?

179
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,550
Hello.

180
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:26,990
I'm jane burke.

181
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,020
Dr. Burke's mother. How nice to see you.

182
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,730
Uh, I'm looking for Dr. Cristina yang.

183
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,320
Yang, yang? Let me see.

184
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,490
Dr. Yang...

185
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,900
I'll page her, but I
think she's in surgery.

186
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,800
I'll wait.

187
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:44,480
- Waffle maker?
- Fine.

188
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,290
- What's the 9-1-1?
- Mama is here.

189
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,410
I'm working with callie.
Callie. Gotta find george.

190
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:58,420
- Your mother?What?

191
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,950
Mama. Mama is here.

192
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,750
Seen george, mer? He's your intern.

193
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:02,750
Oh, burke's mother.

194
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,960
Yeah, make the synapses fi a
little more quickly, meredith.

195
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,270
You know, I was just with a patient.
I'd be very happy to go back there.

196
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,370
No, no, no. You have to help me.

197
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,940
I'll help for the mixmaster
and george's current location.

198
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,660
- Dr. Yang, you scrubbing in?
- Yes, sir. Absolutely.

199
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,480
Just get rid of her, okay? Politely.

200
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,460
- What?
- George!

201
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,060
come on, B. It's okay.

202
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,340
Brian, stop crying, baby. I
can't--I can't think, baby.

203
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,050
I'm--why won't
he stop crying?

204
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,540
Hey there, brian.

205
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,530
whoa, you're a big boy.

206
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:33,620
Do you work out, huh?

207
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,500
You take care... take care of yourselF.

208
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,000
Dr. Karev.

209
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,130
C.T. Results.

210
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,240
Should I page shepherd?

211
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,160
No, he's in surgery. Let me take a look.

212
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,400
- What do you see?
- Uh, there's nothing acute.

213
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,730
Acute? Nothing?

214
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,950
Yeah, I'm gonna--I need to
run a couple more tests, okay?

215
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:58,460
schedule an M.R.I.

216
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,860
- Why?
- Because I said so, nancy drew.

217
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,440
Just do it.

218
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:11,630
Rooms one and seven are private and should be used for private
conversations with patients, not for closed-door socializing.

219
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:15,040
All carts are setup the same.
Memorize where everything is.

220
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,740
Will we be able to do
procedures on our own?

221
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:22,790
No. You are interns.

222
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:26,820
All procedures will be discussed
and overseen by an upper level.

223
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,250
All charts will be signed
out by an upper level.

224
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:32,570
And all patients will be looked
at by someone other than you!

225
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:34,200
And what if--ooh!
I'm sorry.

226
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,840
Uh, I, uh, sorry.

227
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,900
What if we can't find anyone?

228
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,820
Mrs. Burke.

229
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,250
What a surprise to see you here.

230
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,020
Are you visiting someone?

231
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,440
You're the maid of honor.

232
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,530
Miss grey.

233
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,070
That's me.

234
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:56,180
When you stood up in front of preston's
friends and loved ones and you said,"

235
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,400
it's over. It's over. It's so over,

236
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:07,890
were you trying to smash the hopes of the
best man, or were you just trying to be funny?

237
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:08,880
I--

238
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,730
because making light of that
situation would be inappropriate.

239
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:20,810
And to use that moment to send
a message to your boyfriend...

240
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:24,570
well, that'S... selfish.

241
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,780
So were you being inappropriate,

242
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,920
or were you being selfish?

243
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:34,950
I, uh... am, uh...

244
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:39,230
I ologize for that, mrs. Mama, ma'am.

245
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,320
I'm just gonna go. Okay.

246
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:47,570
- Miss grey?
- Yes, ma'am.

247
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:53,390
When you report back to cristina, would you
tell her, please, that i am waiting for her

248
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:57,140
and that I will
continue to wait for her?

249
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,060
Yes, ma'am.

250
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,570
Sorry.

251
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:05,410
Sorry.

252
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,650
Any news on marla?

253
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:09,070
My neighboR.

254
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:12,750
I promise, as soon as I hear
something, I'll, uh, give you an update.

255
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,190
Crap.

256
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:20,050
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

257
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,930
I'm really sorry.

258
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,680
3-part proximal humerus fracture.

259
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,800
He's gonna need a percutaneous
reduction and internal fixation.

260
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,970
That boy of
theirs--brian-- gorgeous.

261
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:35,190
Sometimes they're
not-- kids.

262
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,640
Sometimes they're ugly.

263
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,940
You ve any kids, doctor?

264
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,490
Not that I know of.

265
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,320
Not married either, are you?

266
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,960
I'm afraid I haven't found
anybody who will put up with me.

267
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,140
Well, get on the stick.
Don't do like I did.

268
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:53,080
Don't be a bachelor your whole life.

269
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,380
You can only play the field for so long.

270
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,920
Then suddenly one day, your
whole life passes you by,

271
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,150
and those parts aren't
working like they used to.

272
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:03,800
They have medicine for that now.

273
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:07,860
They don't have medicine for
that "all alone" part, now do they?

274
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,680
No, I suppose not.

275
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,120
You got some pretty ones right here.

276
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,240
Oh, I'm off the market, Mr. RochE.

277
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,750
I--I'm very
happily married.

278
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,870
I'm really sorry.

279
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,540
Sorry.

280
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,600
You can't tell her.

281
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,200
Wh--

282
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,620
we decided.

283
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,650
I'm supposed to tell her.
I have to tell her tonight.

284
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:35,610
No, I know. You can'T.

285
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:38,510
You just--you
can't, okay?

286
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:41,150
I'm working with her. She's my boss.

287
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,070
Damn it!

288
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,100
Maybe it'll just work
itself out if we wait.

289
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,500
You'll grow apart.

290
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,220
- Izzie- - she's been
working long hours.

291
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,720
Maybe she's avoiding you.
Maybe she's having an affair.

292
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,780
- Izzie- -
don't tell her.

293
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:58,540
How long would you suggest I
wait until I tell her about us?

294
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,440
I don't know.

295
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,530
At least until she's
not in such a bad mood.

296
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:05,470
A week? A month?

297
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,690
I'm sorry.

298
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:12,450
But--well, then, you
know, we can't, uh...

299
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:14,210
I know.

300
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:19,610
Then you better walk away.

301
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,970
I better walk away.

302
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,820
Yeah, I really better walk away.

303
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:30,320
So george has clark in line for his C.T.

304
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,140
- Grey.
- Yes.

305
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,050
- Grey.
- Yes.

306
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,500
Okay, I need you to
work in the clinic, grey.

307
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,340
- Well--
- no, no.

308
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:43,500
Before you open your mouth and tell me all the
reasons why you can't, just--just let me say this--

309
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:48,650
i need this, because I have
idiots-- you understand me, grey?

310
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:54,380
Idiot interns are down there in my clinic, a
clinic dripping with my blood, sweat and tears,

311
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:59,750
grey, and I am not convinced-- not at all convinced--
that they will not burn it down with their ineptitude.

312
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:06,900
Look, no, I'm not telling,'cause I-I understand
I do not have the authority to tell.

313
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:10,960
So I'm asking... nicely.

314
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:19,920
Okay, I'm just saying, if I ever did anything
for you, like, I don't know, save your life...

315
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:28,280
if you ever felt you owed me a debt of
thanks, now is when I'd like to collect.

316
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:31,920
Please.

317
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,980
Oh, no.

318
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,750
Hey, are you working down hertoday?

319
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,820
- Uh, I don't, um, know.
- Great.

320
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,540
Well, we have no idea what we're doing.

321
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,900
Plus, I was really hoping we'd
get a chance to speak. So...

322
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,030
yay.

323
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,490
Yay.

324
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,870
I can't believe this.

325
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,230
This is surreal.

326
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:04,110
- You claustrophobic?
- No, I'm not claustrophobic.

327
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:06,950
It's just, I was on my
way to work, you know?

328
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:10,560
I was on my way to work and i stopped at a friend's
house, and the next thing you know, I'm in a cat scan machine.

329
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,620
It's like...

330
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,840
how did this happen?

331
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,090
Dr. Karev.

332
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,690
lab work?

333
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,130
it's crazy, isn't it?

334
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,960
Stay here. Stay in this
room and do not leave.

335
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:31,700
Do not leave that man
alone with that child.

336
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,680
***

337
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:40,940
Dr. Yang, was that Dr. Burke's mother
I saw in the waiting room earlier?

338
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,540
Mrs. Burke is here?

339
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,240
I don't think-- I
wouldn't know, sir.

340
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,070
Okay. How are we doing
up there, shepherd?

341
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,340
Good. She looks good from my end.

342
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,420
That's the best part about
the job, don't you think?

343
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,710
Giving good people second chances.

344
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,580
Believe me, I know. I get it.

345
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,560
But, you know, it's life. It happens.

346
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:02,580
You know, you're going down one path, and
all of a sudden, then you realize, like,

347
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,190
oh, no, no, no, this is
the-- this the wrong path.

348
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,430
This is...

349
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,670
no, this isn't the path for me.

350
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:14,490
And--and it's-- and it's good because you
learn and you realize that you can handle it.

351
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:15,900
And you can.

352
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,060
You can handle this. You...

353
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,790
Clark.

354
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,470
Clark!

355
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:26,900
Clar--code blue. We need
a crash cart in here.

356
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,720
Chief.

357
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,700
The 1 year old-- brian kristler?
He's strung out on meth.

358
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,690
- What?
- Yeah, it was a meth lab that blew up.

359
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:40,360
This woman and her husband
are running a meth lab.

360
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,400
Oh.

361
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,960
clear.

362
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,270
***The joys of surgeondom.

363
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:52,990
Saving the lives for those
who deserve it the most.

364
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:56,080
Tell Dr. Torres to follow
exposure protocol for children.

365
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,450
Tell her I am counting on
her to take care of this.

366
00:17:58,570 --> 00:17:59,910
Got it

367
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:03,680
sure you don't want page somebody to
take over so you can go handle that?

368
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,640
I'm trying to get back
with my wife, derek.

369
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,160
In order to get back with my
wife, I have to learn how to--

370
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,860
delegate.

371
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,680
Dr. Torres can handle this.

372
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,550
- They were shooting him up with-
- no, they weren't shooting him up.

373
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,730
When you cook meth, the fumes, they
coat the walls, the floors.

374
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:21,580
The baby walks around, crawls around, puts its
hands in its mouth, it gets in his bloodstream.

375
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,140
God. Okay, um, call the police and
social services. I'll spread the word.

376
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,960
Wait, what about the dad? He's
still in therewith the kid.

377
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,130
You call the police and social services.

378
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,980
You let them take care of the
dad. You take care of the baby.

379
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,210
Sloan.

380
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,480
We got a situation.

381
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:39,010
You're doing a fine job.

382
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:43,240
You were acting awfully odd
before, had me a little nervous, but--

383
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:47,840
Mr. Roche, I'm gonna ask you a question.

384
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,920
I don't want you to be offended by it, but
the answer could affect your surgery.

385
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,630
Fine. Fire away.

386
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,190
Are you a crystal meth
user? You're kidding, right?

387
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,420
He's, like,60.

388
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,840
No judgment, sir. All I
need's a yes or no answer.

389
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,550
Crystal what? It's a drug, sir.

390
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,420
Um, it's addictive and very dangerous.

391
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:08,700
Well, unless you put it in
my blood pressure medicine, I

392
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,230
- I never touched the stuff.

393
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,840
What's going on?

394
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,840
The kristlers had a meth
lab in their apartment.

395
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,780
It's what caused the explosion.

396
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:21,350
Marla and dave had a drug
lab in their apartment?

397
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,900
No. Impossible.

398
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,200
Absolutely not.

399
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,310
I've known those two
for five--five years.

400
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,970
We go on picnics, to ball games.

401
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:34,780
I babysit for them.

402
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:42,110
I babysit for drug dealers?

403
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,300
o'malley! what happened?

404
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,250
- He coded.
- He coded?

405
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:52,650
Coded, out of nowhere.
Heart stopped. Coded.

406
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,670
- Probably a drug addict.
- What?

407
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,650
That's what I came here to tell you.

408
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,310
That fire that he was in, it
was a meth lab explosion.

409
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,540
He could have
cardiomyopathy from meth usE.

410
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,650
That would explain it.

411
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:05,280
Oh... it's a miracle I got him back.

412
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,440
Wait, you ran the code
yourself? Where's grey?

413
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,520
She's covering in the clinic.

414
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:14,060
What the hell is she doing in the clinic?
I thought I told you to take interns.

415
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,280
I didn't want interns.

416
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:24,150
Sorry about that.

417
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:29,630
Some things, o'malley, some things
just don't need to be told.

418
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,270
How about here? Does it hurt here?

419
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,300
Weird.

420
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,290
It feels weird?

421
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:41,030
No. That lady is staring
at me... or my fat.

422
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,920
Oh, don't worry. She's staring at me.

423
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:48,600
I'll be right back, okay?

424
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,920
well?

425
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,450
How'd surgery go on the mom?

426
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:54,960
Yeah, she'll live. Whatever.

427
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,810
Oh, I tried. I trieD.

428
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:59,130
Mama is not budging, and
she is very scary.

429
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,720
Yeah, obviously.

430
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,400
What does she want?

431
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,800
Did burke send her?

432
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,850
I don't know. I mean, you have to go.

433
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,950
You have to go deal with mama.

434
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:11,280
Just go get it over with and then when
you're done, come back and tell me all about it

435
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,120
because I could really
use a pick-me-up.

436
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,270
Okay, mama showdown is
not for your enjoyment.

437
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:20,790
Besides, my patient is stable and until
I'm paged, I'm gonna stay right here.

438
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:22,310
- she keeps staring at us.
- I know.

439
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:23,600
Make her stop.

440
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,850
- You make her stop.
- You're her sister.

441
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:29,190
I'm an only child. You're her resident.

442
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:34,190
if you have time to stare, you have time
to get me coffee, so move, move, move.

443
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:36,100
Two, stay.

444
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,420
Now see?

445
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,770
If you could just do that with mama...

446
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:51,250
mrS. Burke!

447
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:53,600
I don't think I know you.

448
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,150
I'm george o'malley.

449
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:57,810
I'm a friend of burke'S.
I was burke's guy.

450
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:03,670
Hi, george o'malley-- burke's
friend, burke's guy. Please sit.

451
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:06,000
I guess I have a minute.

452
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:12,370
You know one time he let me live on his
sofa when I had no place else to stay?

453
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:15,690
How is he? Is he... okay?

454
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,390
He's preston.

455
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,550
He's a gentleman.

456
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:23,700
And so... he doesn't
lik to talk about it.

457
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,860
And I just really don't
know what to say to him.

458
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,770
Maybe, uh... I don't know.

459
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:36,530
Maybe you can tell him
that he dodged a bullet.

460
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:38,660
I mean, marriage is...

461
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:42,010
once you're in, you're in.

462
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,070
Burke is smart, you know?

463
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:47,300
He didn't make a mistake.

464
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:51,950
'Cause it's a mistake that, you
know, it's hard to take back.

465
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:55,410
Which, even if you want
to take it back, you can't.

466
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,440
So you can tell him that.

467
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,600
Once you're in, you're in.

468
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,920
Make sure you have that engraved on
your wedding ring when you get married.

469
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,150
Oh, I'm already married.

470
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:11,500
You're already married?

471
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:20,310
George o'malley-- burke's friend, burke's
guy-- staying in a marriage out of obligation?

472
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:24,950
That's no way to live.
That's no way to love.

473
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,200
But I think you know that.

474
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:32,560
I do.

475
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,840
Sometimes I do.

476
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:43,410
Oh, your timing could not have been
more perfect. Where are we going?

477
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,770
What do you mean, where are we going?

478
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:45,590
You paged me, right?

479
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:48,200
- I did.
- Good. So on call room?

480
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,280
You know, I was thinking maybe
we could, uh, go to the cafeteria.

481
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,310
Thought you might be hungry.

482
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,160
Why are you looking at me like that?

483
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,440
Derek, we agreed--
"s" and "m" only.

484
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,540
- "S" and "m"?
- Sex and mockery.

485
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,140
Right,"s" and "M.

486
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,800
- So you're eating lunch?
- I am.

487
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,960
- Want to come?
- No.

488
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,020
Meet me in the lobby at 8:00.

489
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,180
- And eat your dinner first.
- Yeah, great. Perfect.

490
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:19,330
that's a really big needle, man. Do
you have to use such a big needle?

491
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:21,760
His I.V. Came out,and
he needs to be hydrated.

492
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,790
- Okay, okay. Look, I'm--
shh. -it's all right

493
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:25,270
Look, I'm just--I'm freaking
out a little bit here.

494
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:28,000
I mean, do you think you could
get me an update on my wife?

495
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,130
Your wife has a crater in her abdomen,
so even if she does survive surgery,

496
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:33,950
it's gonna be a
long, hard, painful recovery.

497
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:36,260
she's gonna be okay, right?
I mean, she's gotta be okay.

498
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,580
Wh--brian, please, sweetheart, look
at me. Brian, okay, stop crying.

499
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,960
Brian, please. Brian, stop crying!

500
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,750
He can't stop crying!

501
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,150
okay?

502
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:49,540
He can't stop crying because
his nervous system is shot.

503
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:54,060
He can't stop crying because his brain and his
heart and his renal system are all compromised.

504
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:59,440
He can't stop crying because he's in
withdrawal from crystal meth, you son of a bitch.

505
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,890
no, no. That's impossible.

506
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,840
He wasn't in the room
when we were making it.

507
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,760
It was all over your apartment, okay?

508
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,270
I tested him'ause i
smelled it on his skin.

509
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:11,190
I love my son.

510
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:15,410
Okay, we--we were
broke. I lost my job.

511
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,900
And I'm a good dad,
and I love my family.

512
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:21,810
Well, now you can love
your family from jail.

513
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,700
I'm sorry.

514
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,420
Dr. Torres.

515
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:46,470
- Yeah, chief.
- Yeah, chief"?

516
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:52,090
Is it that you don't know what's going on in
my hospital, Dr. Torres, or that you don't care?

517
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:53,940
Um, I'm sorry. I guess I don't know.

518
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:57,030
I delegated the meth
lab situation to you.

519
00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:00,270
And now one of youresidents has
been attacked and a baby is missing.

520
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:01,430
I don't understand.
I told karev to take--

521
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,450
I don't want to hear
any of your excuses.

522
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:04,850
Finish up here.

523
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:07,960
You better hope that baby shows up.

524
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,070
I think you're a good chief resident.

525
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:24,940
what?

526
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,130
I know--I know that you've
been having a hard time with it,

527
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:32,380
and--and this thing with the
baby... clearly it's not an easy job,

528
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,810
and I think you're
doing a good job at it.

529
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:49,820
I can take it from here.

530
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:52,640
- What?
- Get out of my O.R.,Stevens.

531
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,500
Now!

532
00:26:57,430 --> 00:27:00,450
So the happy little family makes meth.

533
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:02,780
There's no such thing as a happy family.

534
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:06,540
What's with her?

535
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:09,580
Well, mama burke is here,
and we don't know why.

536
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,350
My guess is that she's
here to kill cristina.

537
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,510
She's hovering again.

538
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:20,450
If you're done with the charts, go
fold something, like, you know, sheets.

539
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,860
What are you lookin'at?

540
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:26,980
Don't look at her.

541
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,120
Your sister. She's hot.

542
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,510
I'm an only child.

543
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:31,020
don't talk to me about lexie.

544
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:34,250
Oh, the police want to talk to me.

545
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,410
You know,
all I want to know is why she's herE.

546
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,090
Is that too much to ask?

547
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,810
he's not returning
my phone calls anymore.

548
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,940
He's doing his best.

549
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:57,100
Do you think... do you think
she really loved him-- cristina?

550
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:01,020
I-I think she loved him
the best that she knew how.

551
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,380
And that would not have
been enough for you either?

552
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,440
No.

553
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,200
It wouldn't have been
enough for me either.

554
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,580
So you would've ended it, too?

555
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,860
Well... burke and I
are-- are built differently.

556
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,800
He's stronger than I am.

557
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:25,460
He was strong enough to...
and, um, we're not built the same.

558
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,500
honorable men are all built the same.

559
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,990
And you think I'm an honorable man?

560
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:34,260
Do you know when to walk away?

561
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:38,030
Do you know when not
to take less than you deserve?

562
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:41,780
If you do, then you're an honorable man.

563
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:50,460
When you got injured in the fire, the shock to your body combined with the drugs and the damage--

564
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,640
your heart seized up,
and you went into cardiac arrest.

565
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:57,200
You're also bleeding internally,
so you need to stay for observation,

566
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:01,780
which means that you are probably
about to go into withdrawal.

567
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:06,620
But you can't leave because it is still
quite possible that you'll need surgery.

568
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:11,030
You got any good news, Dr. O'malley?

569
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,990
I wish I could say yes.

570
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,640
Come on.

571
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,030
Where are you?

572
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,260
Damn it!

573
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,980
How's the surgery on the old guy?

574
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,220
Fine.

575
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,480
Callie?

576
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,300
Damn it. I can't talk right now.
I have to find a baby.

577
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,650
Are you okay?

578
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,560
A baby was lost... on my watch.

579
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,480
I am chief resident.

580
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,350
I am responsible.

581
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,990
And the chief,
he gave this to me, and I blew it.

582
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,490
And--and now a baby's missing.

583
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:41,010
So no, I'm not okay.

584
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,740
No.

585
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,190
No, you are not okay.

586
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,080
Plus, I think...

587
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,240
I think my husband's having an affair.

588
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,240
well, if that's true, he's an idiot.

589
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:06,100
and if that's true,
you need to talk to him.

590
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:11,030
You know, as an alternative
to destroying your career.

591
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:18,980
Um, Dr. Grey...

592
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:22,360
I was wondering, do you know
where the thermometers are?'Cause--

593
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,150
do you really not know where
the thermometers are, lexie?

594
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:26,650
Or are you just looking
for an excuse to talk to me?

595
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,610
I-- simple question, lexie.

596
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,770
Are you an idiot or a stalker?

597
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:35,860
Okay.

598
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,180
that was a mean thing to say.

599
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:41,560
I'm aware of that because I'm
generally not a me but I'm a person

600
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:44,230
who just doesn't want to know you.

601
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:47,330
And you are a person who's
making that very difficult.

602
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:51,710
So please, just stop making
it so difficult for me to not know you.

603
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,560
Okay?

604
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,540
brian, oh, my god.

605
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,430
Please, wake up, baby. Please.

606
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,100
Mr. Kristler.

607
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,360
He won't wake up.

608
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,230
He was shaking, and then
he just--he just-- he won't wake up.

609
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,350
Let me take him, Mr. Kristler.

610
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,720
No, I love my baby.

611
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,730
I don't want to leave my baby.

612
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:20,960
It sounds like he had a seizure.

613
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,660
- Okay, please let me-
- I don't want to go to jail.

614
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,630
You don't want him to die, so
if you love him, please let me take him.

615
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,660
I'm sorry! Let me take him.

616
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,580
Baby, please.

617
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:34,600
**a stroke.

618
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:38,150
You can yell, you know?

619
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:40,020
Not my job anymore.

620
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,480
I'm just saying, you can if you want.

621
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,260
I-I deserve it.

622
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,490
Oh, you do deserve it.

623
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:50,910
You do deserve, Dr. Karev, to be chastised for your stunningly poor decision making.

624
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:57,350
You--you've certainly earned a-a reprimand for your unbelievably destructive tactical error.

625
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:03,740
You got in the face of a drug dealer?

626
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,740
You got in the face of a drug
dealer before the police had arri--

627
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:10,770
you got in the face of a known felon while his 1-year-old child was still in the room?

628
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:12,030
Are you stupid?

629
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:13,310
Are you without intelligence?

630
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:14,990
Because I know you were
taught better than that.

631
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:17,840
I taught you better than that,
Dr. Karev.

632
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:19,880
Gettin'in the face of a drug dealer.

633
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,570
Fool.

634
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,500
Thank you.

635
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,160
Oh, no. Thank you.

636
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:40,120
I am nice person.

637
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,880
Okay, I-I am.

638
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,280
And... i don't know what
it is that I did to you,

639
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,250
but, you know, we have the same dad.

640
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:50,180
So I was just thinking
that a simple conversation--

641
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,070
we don't have the same dad, lexie.

642
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:56,860
You and I, we do not have the same dad.

643
00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:00,370
My dad disappeared when I was
5 years old, and I never saw him again.

644
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:02,700
Does that sound like
the daddy you grew up with?

645
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:09,900
I cked a man out of my
bed in the middle of the night--

646
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:14,300
the world's most perfect man,
who loves me, and I can't let him.

647
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:17,600
And it doesn't take
a shrink to figure out why.

648
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:20,070
Because our dad chose you.

649
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:23,670
So I'm sure you are
a very nice girl, lexie.

650
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:28,990
But I hope you can understand, you're not a girl I ever wanted to have to know.

651
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,740
I never even tried drugs until I was 30.

652
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,180
Stupid.

653
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,590
I'm so stupid.

654
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:48,920
I went to a party, and there was all
this-- this meth floating around and...

655
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:51,080
I just figured, what the heck?

656
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,240
Once won't kill you.

657
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,800
And then-- and then it's more than once, then it's all you can think about, and then--

658
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:58,500
then you're outside your dealer's
house at 7:00 in the morning.

659
00:33:58,890 --> 00:33:59,770
This isn't me.

660
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:01,580
It--it isn'T. I'm not this guy.

661
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,810
I'm--I'm not this guy.

662
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:04,050
I'm not this guy.

663
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,440
clark?

664
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,560
hello.

665
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,780
It took you long enough.

666
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,880
Yes.

667
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:24,670
I came for preston's key.

668
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:28,930
I'd like to pick up some of his things and the necklace I ge you for the weddinG.

669
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:30,480
Of--of course.

670
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:35,720
just, uh, leave it under
the mat when you're ne.

671
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:40,050
And I wanted to say I'm sorry.

672
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:45,100
I... I've come to know you, I think.

673
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:50,230
And what you love even more
than preston is being a surgeon.

674
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:57,730
You are planning to continue with cardiothoracic surgy like my son, am I correct?

675
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,590
Yes.

676
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:02,410
So I'm sorry you lost the man you love.

677
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:06,460
But more than that,
I'm sorry you lost your teacher.

678
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:08,630
With him by your side...

679
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:13,760
you could've become
a brilliant heart surgeon.

680
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:18,220
I see.

681
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,280
You're a strong woman, cristina.

682
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:22,820
I respect that.

683
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:28,120
I wish I could've been
born at another time.

684
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,570
I might be more like you.

685
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:37,500
So I shall leave the key under the mat.

686
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,330
Uh, can you take the gifts?

687
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:43,640
There are all these wedding gifts,
and I can'T...

688
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:46,220
can you--can you please take them away?

689
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:48,830
Of course I can.

690
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,660
He's never coming back, is he?

691
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:55,250
Not even to say good-bye.

692
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,720
Remember... you're a strong woman.

693
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,720
His heart couldn't take it.

694
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,600
There was just too much damage.

695
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,890
He couldn't take it.

696
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,590
I'm not this guy.

697
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:30,900
I won't be this guy who...

698
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,020
I'm going to tell her.

699
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,230
oh, chief.

700
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:40,450
I, uh-- I've got paperwork, Dr. Torres.

701
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,900
Kidnapd babies make
for a lot of paperwork.

702
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:47,330
I was planning on maybe
going to see my wife tonight.

703
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:49,630
But instead, I get to do this.

704
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:50,390
I could help.

705
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:51,680
I mean, I-I could-- I could help.

706
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,570
No, you've helped enough for one day.

707
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:05,190
What... h-how did I get...

708
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:08,780
you were cooking crystal
meth and the substances exploded.

709
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,240
Where's--where's my--

710
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:18,000
your husband and your son,
u sustained only minor injuries.

711
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:23,060
Althought seems, um, your son had been
passively ingesting methamphetamine.

712
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:27,000
He suffered a stroke earlier today
and went into surgery this afternoon.

713
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,160
I believe the surgery went smoothly.

714
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:34,040
Your husband was taken by the police, and I'm sure they'll be wanting to speak to you as well.

715
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,270
oh, okay.

716
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:41,130
Okay, you know what?

717
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:42,810
Just try--try to breathe.

718
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:44,020
Slowly.

719
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,900
Slowly.

720
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,810
Breathe.

721
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:53,130
I'm sure it must feel...
as though everything is coming apart.

722
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:55,440
But you can get through this.

723
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:58,190
Just... breathe.

724
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,070
breathe.

725
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:09,380
The thing about addiction
is it never ends well.

726
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:15,770
Because eventually whatever
it is that was getting us high...

727
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:24,040
stops feeling good and starts to hurt.

728
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,880
wa to grab a drink?

729
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:30,270
I have a problem.

730
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:32,270
What's up?

731
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:34,130
No, I'm just...

732
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,860
I'm admitting I...

733
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,400
I have a problem.

734
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:53,650
What's gonna happen
to them and the baby?

735
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,470
Um... his grandmother is coming fohim.

736
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:00,290
I think she's gonna take custody.

737
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:04,090
they were it.

738
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,220
They were my family.

739
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:09,640
Can you imagine?

740
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,870
After 60 years on this planet...

741
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:16,910
my family's a couple
of drug dealers and their kid.

742
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:28,800
You know, just because
people do horrible things,

743
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,300
it doesn't always mean
they're horrible people.

744
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,550
Still, they say you don't kick
the habit till you hit rock bottom.

745
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:49,080
But how do you know when you're there?

746
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,220
So I take it you still want to talk?

747
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:53,400
Yeah, I do.

748
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,250
no.

749
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:58,160
- No, I-
- no, you don'T.

750
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,670
George, please. Just...

751
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:05,410
please, please don't say anything.

752
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:06,970
Please. I am asking you as your wife.

753
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:08,410
I am asking you not to say anything.

754
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:12,460
I am asking you to just not.

755
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:15,380
Not tonight.

756
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:18,940
I am your wife.

757
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,240
Do this for me?

758
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:33,670
Okay.

759
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:44,220
Dr. Grey.

760
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,860
I'm heading over to joe'S.
You want to grab a drink?

761
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:46,820
Oh, no, thanks.

762
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,630
I'm, uh, meeting someone.

763
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:50,000
Yeah.

764
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,920
Derek asked me to track you down.

765
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,740
He's, uh, stuck with a patient.

766
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:56,840
Not gonna be able to meet you.

767
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,370
Sends his apologies.

768
00:40:58,490 --> 00:40:59,980
Oh, okay.

769
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:02,750
So... Joe's?

770
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:04,730
I think I'm going home.

771
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:16,160
Meredith.

772
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:22,290
Because no matter how
badly a thing is hurting us...

773
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:30,520
sometimes letting
it go hurts even worse.
