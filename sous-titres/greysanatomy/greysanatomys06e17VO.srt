<i>Whatever the game is...
(grunts)</i>

2
00:00:13,235 --> 00:00:15,536
<i>We like to win.
(exhales)</i>

3
00:00:15,571 --> 00:00:18,706
<i>And once we win,
we get a new game.</i>

4
00:00:19,741 --> 00:00:23,710
Today...
Feels like the day to me.

5
00:00:23,745 --> 00:00:26,079
I think by the close
of business today,

6
00:00:26,114 --> 00:00:28,649
I've got cartilage
in a bottle.
(groans)

7
00:00:28,683 --> 00:00:31,418
What's with you?
You and derek.

8
00:00:31,452 --> 00:00:34,321
You're all, "don't screw
the nurses and the drug reps."

9
00:00:34,355 --> 00:00:35,923
You did a psych rotation.

10
00:00:35,957 --> 00:00:37,206
You know what happens
when you tell someone

11
00:00:37,206 --> 00:00:40,656
Not to think
about an elephant?
You spend a lot of time
thinking about an--

12
00:00:40,656 --> 00:00:42,060
I walk around
the hospital

13
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,972
Trying not to make eye contact
with the women.

14
00:00:46,067 --> 00:00:49,036
I'm... Lonely

15
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,470
And unhappy.

16
00:00:50,505 --> 00:00:52,572
I don't see
how this is a solution.

17
00:00:52,607 --> 00:00:55,609
Find a grown-up who wants
what you want and date...

18
00:00:55,643 --> 00:00:57,144
Like a grown-up.

19
00:00:57,178 --> 00:00:59,112
I don't know what that means.

20
00:00:59,147 --> 00:01:00,380
(groans)

21
00:01:00,415 --> 00:01:03,283
(woman) âª ...To make
a clear mind âª

22
00:01:03,318 --> 00:01:05,552
Oncology's kept you busy--
two rounds of chemo,

23
00:01:05,586 --> 00:01:09,570
Brachytherapy, two rounds
of external radiation.

24
00:01:09,605 --> 00:01:11,957
Not to mention coenzymes,
shark cartilage,

25
00:01:11,992 --> 00:01:12,932
Milk thistle.

26
00:01:12,967 --> 00:01:15,501
I'm open to, you know,
pretty much anything.

27
00:01:15,536 --> 00:01:18,775
Except surgery.
That's because
surgery's not gonna work.

28
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,998
We'd like to hear
all the options.

29
00:01:21,033 --> 00:01:23,387
Well, your scans
will be back any moment,

30
00:01:23,422 --> 00:01:25,457
And I'll have a look--
let me tell you
what you'll see.

31
00:01:25,492 --> 00:01:28,241
My tumor's the size
of a football.
Audrey--

32
00:01:28,276 --> 00:01:30,101
It's wrapped around
my organs.

33
00:01:30,136 --> 00:01:33,403
And if you try to cut it ovt,
it'll kill me.

34
00:01:34,138 --> 00:01:35,882
(sighs)
that's what you'll see.

35
00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:37,749
<i>We push ourselves.</i>

36
00:01:37,783 --> 00:01:39,484
<i>Residents, attendings--</i>

37
00:01:39,518 --> 00:01:42,220
<i>It doesn't matter
how much we achieve.</i>

38
00:01:42,254 --> 00:01:45,890
<i>If you're a climber, there's
always another mountain.
Uh, hunt.</i>

39
00:01:45,925 --> 00:01:47,792
Mm.
These are your scans.

40
00:01:47,827 --> 00:01:51,963
Mm-hmm.
I was just looking around.
Uh, that's quite a tumor.

41
00:01:51,998 --> 00:01:54,766
Huge. There's probably
nothing to be done.

42
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,702
(richard) hmm. You mind
if I take a stab at it?

43
00:01:57,737 --> 00:02:00,538
Well, it sounds strange to you,
I'm sure, but, uh,

44
00:02:00,573 --> 00:02:03,141
I only have
a few years left in the game,

45
00:02:03,175 --> 00:02:06,878
And there may not be so many
big tumors left for me.

46
00:02:06,912 --> 00:02:08,813
Of course.

47
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:11,383
Yore welcome to it.
(whispering)
what are you doing?

48
00:02:11,417 --> 00:02:13,685
Thanks, hunt.
You're a good egg.
What are you doing?

49
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:17,088
I'm sure you've got
work to do, dr. Yang.
Mm-hmm.

50
00:02:17,123 --> 00:02:19,524
(elevator bell dings)

51
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:24,494
Chart.

52
00:02:24,529 --> 00:02:26,029
Oh.

53
00:02:26,064 --> 00:02:27,831
Ugh.
(mouths words)

54
00:02:27,865 --> 00:02:29,499
(clears throat)

55
00:02:29,534 --> 00:02:32,069
(normal voice)
what are you doing?
What?

56
00:02:32,103 --> 00:02:34,504
This is a monster case,
and he just stole it from you

57
00:02:34,539 --> 00:02:36,807
With some crap about mortality
and old men?

58
00:02:36,841 --> 00:02:39,610
He's playing you.
What are you doing?!
All right, all right. Um...

59
00:02:41,967 --> 00:02:43,743
Dr. Webber.

60
00:02:43,778 --> 00:02:45,015
Transcript by Addic7ed.com

61
00:02:46,384 --> 00:02:50,220
Dr. Webber, I'd like to keep
audrey taylor. She was my case--
you gave it to me.

62
00:02:50,255 --> 00:02:52,589
Oh, no, you swiped it.
Cristina--

63
00:02:52,624 --> 00:02:55,492
'cause it's got harper avery
written all over it.
When dr. Avery was here,
he did mention

64
00:02:55,526 --> 00:02:57,327
That I need to dive back
into my research.

65
00:02:57,362 --> 00:03:00,631
This case would be perfect
for that--
richard,
this thing is a monster.

66
00:03:00,665 --> 00:03:02,599
At best it's damage control.

67
00:03:02,634 --> 00:03:05,702
I'd be operating
by the seat of my pants.
On the contrary.
A tumor like this

68
00:03:05,737 --> 00:03:09,373
Calls for a methodical analysis
of the scans, a careful plan--
old-school, which--

69
00:03:09,407 --> 00:03:11,942
Old? Wow.

70
00:03:11,976 --> 00:03:14,278
I didn't see that coming.

71
00:03:14,312 --> 00:03:16,780
I-I didn't not mean your age.
I meant the approach.

72
00:03:16,814 --> 00:03:19,182
Let's not make this personal.
You just did, ginger.

73
00:03:19,217 --> 00:03:21,418
(elevator bell dings)
and you're right.

74
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:24,187
I've been resecting tumors
since you were in diapers.

75
00:03:24,222 --> 00:03:26,056
In my experience,
they demand something

76
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:31,448
<i>A little me elegant than
"by the seat of your pants."
this is my patient.</i>

77
00:03:31,483 --> 00:03:32,831
L--
good morning.
Why are we auing?

78
00:03:32,866 --> 00:03:35,132
(cristina) that.
Wow. Big.

79
00:03:35,167 --> 00:03:36,825
Whose patient is this?
(owen and richard) mine.

80
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:40,304
Work on it together.
Well, the harper avery
is an individual award.

81
00:03:40,339 --> 00:03:44,519
Ah, I see where this is going.
A case like this needs
an aggressive approach that--

82
00:03:44,554 --> 00:03:47,146
Sloppy. It requires
a methodical analysis--

83
00:03:47,181 --> 00:03:49,081
Some would say outmoded.
Outmoded?

84
00:03:49,116 --> 00:03:51,303
Yeah.
All right.
There's nothing wrong

85
00:03:51,338 --> 00:03:52,992
With a little friendly,
professional competition.

86
00:03:53,027 --> 00:03:54,896
Come up with plans, present 'em
to me. I will choose.

87
00:03:54,931 --> 00:03:57,130
Dr. Yang,
dr. Grey will assist.
Yes.

88
00:03:57,353 --> 00:04:01,132
I'm with webber. What?
He's got it in the bag.

89
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,192
(scoffs)

90
00:04:04,227 --> 00:04:06,061
Sir.

91
00:04:08,463 --> 00:04:10,097
"I'm with webber"?

92
00:04:10,131 --> 00:04:12,466
Why'd you push me
to do it in the first place?

93
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,435
Now you'll know
what your plan is

94
00:04:14,469 --> 00:04:16,403
And what his plan is.

95
00:04:16,438 --> 00:04:18,372
Wait. You're--
you're gonna spy on him?

96
00:04:18,406 --> 00:04:20,140
That's--that's cheating.

97
00:04:20,175 --> 00:04:22,776
You're adorable
when you're slow.

98
00:04:22,811 --> 00:04:24,912
You have a dark,
dark mind.

99
00:04:24,946 --> 00:04:26,380
(elevator bell dings)

100
00:04:26,414 --> 00:04:28,415
(chuckles)

101
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,950
Here.
Thanks.

102
00:04:29,984 --> 00:04:32,119
Hey.
You working tonight?

103
00:04:32,153 --> 00:04:34,121
Uh, no.
I'm going to yoga class.

104
00:04:34,155 --> 00:04:36,590
Yeah, there's nothing
about that statement

105
00:04:36,624 --> 00:04:38,525
That makes any sense.
Tuck's with his father,

106
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,527
And the facist vegan
next door

107
00:04:40,562 --> 00:04:42,396
Gave me a yoga class
for christmas.

108
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,665
<i>No. You're having dinner
with me.</i>

109
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:46,433
Uh, the facist vegan thinks

110
00:04:46,468 --> 00:04:48,969
That yoga's going to make me
a better person,

111
00:04:49,003 --> 00:04:50,404
Which is unlikely,

112
00:04:50,438 --> 00:04:53,173
But if I don't go, I'll have to
hear about it every time--

113
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,142
"well, my back kinda hurts,
but the breathing.

114
00:04:55,176 --> 00:04:58,645
I've never breathed like that
before in my life."
what?

115
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,848
That's what people say
after their first yoga class.

116
00:05:00,882 --> 00:05:02,783
Tell her that.
Have dinner with me.

117
00:05:02,817 --> 00:05:04,785
(elevator bell dings)
come on. Now try it.

118
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:07,955
My back kinda hurts,
but the breathing. I...

119
00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:11,224
I've never breathed
like that in my life.
More conviction.

120
00:05:11,258 --> 00:05:14,127
<i>I've never breathed
like that in my life.</i>

121
00:05:14,161 --> 00:05:16,529
There you go.
(laughs)

122
00:05:16,564 --> 00:05:19,232
(sighs)

123
00:05:19,266 --> 00:05:23,203
(computer keys clicking)

124
00:05:23,237 --> 00:05:26,172
<i>(woman speaks indistinctly
over p.A.)</i>

125
00:05:27,707 --> 00:05:28,907
What?

126
00:05:28,941 --> 00:05:30,709
This, um, this patient--

127
00:05:30,743 --> 00:05:32,911
I can't find the heartbeat.

128
00:05:32,945 --> 00:05:35,380
So call the morgue,
40-watt.
He's not dead.

129
00:05:35,414 --> 00:05:36,781
He's sitting up.
He's talking.

130
00:05:36,816 --> 00:05:39,951
Dude, you're lucky you have
a famous last name.

131
00:05:39,985 --> 00:05:41,820
Take a deep breath, sir.

132
00:05:41,854 --> 00:05:43,755
I'm having...
Trouble doing that.

133
00:05:43,789 --> 00:05:47,459
Oh, grow up, todd.
When he was 9,
they removed his right lung.

134
00:05:47,493 --> 00:05:49,928
And now the other one's
crapping out on me.

135
00:05:49,962 --> 00:05:51,896
Or maybe you're having
an anxiety attack

136
00:05:51,931 --> 00:05:54,766
Because I just asked you
to move in with me.
I can't find his heart.

137
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,735
Oh, yeah? Me neither.
No, I really can't.

138
00:05:56,769 --> 00:05:59,804
So who's the 40-watt now?
I can't...

139
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:01,639
I can't--
oh, whoa.

140
00:06:01,674 --> 00:06:05,043
Get a stat chest x-ray
and page cardio.
(grunts)

141
00:06:06,177 --> 00:06:08,869
There she is...
By your kidney.

142
00:06:08,904 --> 00:06:12,644
My heart is by my kidney?
That's why it was hard
to hear your heartbeat.

143
00:06:12,679 --> 00:06:15,229
And without a second lung
in your chest cavity,

144
00:06:15,264 --> 00:06:17,320
Your heart sort of drifted.

145
00:06:17,354 --> 00:06:19,388
It's called
post-pneumonectomy syndrome.

146
00:06:19,423 --> 00:06:21,190
And the shifting caused
some bronchial compression.

147
00:06:21,225 --> 00:06:24,527
That's why you weren't able
to breathe.
I'm the biggest bitch
in the world.

148
00:06:24,561 --> 00:06:27,697
Can you put it back
where it goes?
Yes, we're gonna use
saline implants in your chest

149
00:06:27,731 --> 00:06:29,365
To keep it in place.

150
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:32,301
Implants?
Like what they use for--
fake boobs.

151
00:06:32,336 --> 00:06:34,904
You want to put--
I can't have--

152
00:06:34,938 --> 00:06:39,008
No. We're--I--I'm a guy.
Okay? I'm a guy's guy.

153
00:06:39,043 --> 00:06:41,343
Well, you won't actually
see them.
Yeah, but still.

154
00:06:41,377 --> 00:06:44,580
I mean, come on, man.
You know what I'm saying.

155
00:06:44,614 --> 00:06:47,716
I mean, how am I supposed to,
you know--
what? Pick up women?

156
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,751
You mean how do you explain
your boobs

157
00:06:49,786 --> 00:06:53,188
To the next chick who's
dumb enough to date you?

158
00:06:53,223 --> 00:06:56,658
Molly. Molly.

159
00:06:56,693 --> 00:06:58,360
(door closes)

160
00:06:58,394 --> 00:06:59,862
Do I have a choice?

161
00:06:59,896 --> 00:07:02,798
Do you like to breathe?

162
00:07:02,832 --> 00:07:04,867
(owen) so, yes, there is
a surgical option.

163
00:07:04,901 --> 00:07:06,368
We're just--

164
00:07:06,402 --> 00:07:08,570
Uh, we're still figuring out
the best approach.

165
00:07:08,605 --> 00:07:12,274
The risks with the surgery
are very high.

166
00:07:12,308 --> 00:07:15,911
The tumor has compromised
the organs to the point

167
00:07:15,945 --> 00:07:19,147
Where anything we do to try
to remove it would--
would kill me.

168
00:07:19,182 --> 00:07:21,717
Audrey, ple--you're not even
listening to them.

169
00:07:21,751 --> 00:07:24,253
Okay, it doesn't make sense.
I just want one more month.

170
00:07:24,287 --> 00:07:27,723
I'm not gonna risk
dying before that.

171
00:07:27,757 --> 00:07:30,359
One more month?

172
00:07:30,393 --> 00:07:33,161
(clears throat)
our daughter's getting married

173
00:07:33,196 --> 00:07:34,796
In a month.

174
00:07:34,831 --> 00:07:37,366
And I would like
to see her do that.

175
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,001
I would...

176
00:07:39,035 --> 00:07:42,838
I would like to see her
on the happiest day of her life.

177
00:07:42,872 --> 00:07:44,840
Mrs. Taylor, if we don't try
the surgery,

178
00:07:44,874 --> 00:07:47,609
You might not
make it through the month.

179
00:07:47,644 --> 00:07:49,778
(sighs)

180
00:07:55,585 --> 00:07:57,185
Then...

181
00:07:58,755 --> 00:08:01,823
I look forward to hearing...

182
00:08:01,858 --> 00:08:03,959
What you come up with.

183
00:08:03,993 --> 00:08:05,861
(mouths word)

184
00:08:11,935 --> 00:08:15,103
Hi, I'm dr. Grey.
Hi. Uh, he's really hot

185
00:08:15,138 --> 00:08:17,039
And his stomach's hurting
so much.

186
00:08:17,073 --> 00:08:20,008
(moaning)
he was fine. We were playing
at the zoo one minute,

187
00:08:20,043 --> 00:08:22,411
And he was fine.
I don't--please.
Okay.

188
00:08:22,445 --> 00:08:24,346
All right, noah, does it hurt
over here? Ooh.

189
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,348
Ah! Ah.
It's okay, baby.

190
00:08:26,382 --> 00:08:28,350
Okay, page dr. Robbins, stat.
(woman) right away, dr. Grey.

191
00:08:28,384 --> 00:08:31,320
Hey, um, do you have a minute?
I've got a question.

192
00:08:31,354 --> 00:08:34,222
Sure.
I wanted to talk to you
about breast implants.

193
00:08:34,257 --> 00:08:36,558
(elevator bell dings)
really? Good for you.

194
00:08:36,593 --> 00:08:39,561
You know, it crossed my mind
the first time I saw you,

195
00:08:39,596 --> 00:08:42,531
But I didn'think you were
the type to go for it.

196
00:08:42,565 --> 00:08:45,734
No. N-not--not for me.
For my patient.

197
00:08:45,768 --> 00:08:47,769
<i>Oh. Oh.</i>

198
00:08:47,804 --> 00:08:49,538
(chuckles)
(laughs) of course.

199
00:08:49,572 --> 00:08:53,041
Hey. Can I steal him
for a quick consult?

200
00:08:53,076 --> 00:08:54,776
(sighs)
yeah, he's all yours.

201
00:08:54,811 --> 00:08:56,478
(groans)

202
00:08:56,512 --> 00:08:58,580
Yeah, I was just...

203
00:08:58,615 --> 00:09:00,282
(whispering) she's what
you're looking for.

204
00:09:00,316 --> 00:09:03,852
She's age appropriate,
probably wants kids.
Yeah.

205
00:09:03,886 --> 00:09:06,922
Ask her out.
I'm not sure
that's gonna work.

206
00:09:06,956 --> 00:09:09,324
(normal voice) great. Thanks.
As you were.

207
00:09:09,359 --> 00:09:10,859
(mark sighs)

208
00:09:10,893 --> 00:09:12,961
Teddy, I'm sorry about that.

209
00:09:12,996 --> 00:09:16,098
Your breasts are fantastic.
I wouldn't change a thg.

210
00:09:18,735 --> 00:09:20,836
The patient.

211
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,938
Um, he, uh...

212
00:09:22,972 --> 00:09:24,973
He's got
post-pneumonectomy syndrome,

213
00:09:25,008 --> 00:09:28,477
And I wanted to use the implants
to stabilize his heart.

214
00:09:28,511 --> 00:09:31,513
Of course.
Let me take a look.

215
00:09:33,016 --> 00:09:36,151
Uh, so asking you out
tonight...

216
00:09:36,185 --> 00:09:37,753
Probably a bad idea?

217
00:09:37,787 --> 00:09:40,188
(laughs) y-you think?

218
00:09:48,931 --> 00:09:50,198
What?

219
00:09:50,233 --> 00:09:53,335
Mark sloan just asked me out.

220
00:09:53,369 --> 00:09:55,070
Huh.

221
00:09:55,104 --> 00:09:56,605
Cool.

222
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,609
<i>No, no, not "cool."
mark sloan.</i>

223
00:10:00,643 --> 00:10:02,944
Exactly.
Why not have a little fun?

224
00:10:02,979 --> 00:10:05,013
I mean, mark is like, uh...
Candy.

225
00:10:05,048 --> 00:10:08,417
Eat it and forget about it.
Right? Come on. You know what?

226
00:10:08,451 --> 00:10:11,586
This might be
the best idea I've ever had.
(elevator bell dings)

227
00:10:11,621 --> 00:10:13,088
(beeps)

228
00:10:15,024 --> 00:10:17,592
Will you, uh, have to resect
a part of the diaphragm?

229
00:10:17,627 --> 00:10:19,327
Well, most likely.

230
00:10:19,362 --> 00:10:22,564
Or I might let you do
the resection.

231
00:10:22,598 --> 00:10:23,999
Really?

232
00:10:24,033 --> 00:10:26,368
Yep, that or kick you off
the case.

233
00:10:26,402 --> 00:10:30,372
Depends on how much
you've leaked to dr. Hunt.

234
00:10:30,406 --> 00:10:33,175
I've been doing this
a long time, dr. Yang.

235
00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:35,444
You're working
for the other side.

236
00:10:35,478 --> 00:10:37,279
Now...

237
00:10:37,313 --> 00:10:39,548
There is another option...

238
00:10:39,582 --> 00:10:43,618
If you would like
to realign your allegiances.

239
00:10:43,653 --> 00:10:45,687
Like be a double agent?

240
00:10:45,722 --> 00:10:47,656
And we could keep looking

241
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:51,326
For more resections
for you  perform.

242
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,496
So you think about it.

243
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,331
Take your time.

244
00:10:58,034 --> 00:11:01,002
It's a big tumor.

245
00:11:06,776 --> 00:11:11,518
Ymaking headway on my cartilage,

246
00:11:11,553 --> 00:11:13,448
But I keep getting
42 intern questions an hour.

247
00:11:13,483 --> 00:11:16,351
Can they rotate through
your service just for today?
Oh, sure. (giggles)

248
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:17,686
Thanks.

249
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,887
What is with you?

250
00:11:20,922 --> 00:11:23,090
Nothing.

251
00:11:23,124 --> 00:11:25,225
Is it the guy? (gasps)

252
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,160
(whispers) it's the guy?

253
00:11:27,195 --> 00:11:30,564
(normal voice)
he brought you coffee?
(laughs) no. You think
I smile like this for coffee.

254
00:11:30,598 --> 00:11:32,966
Uh, he's making me dinner.

255
00:11:33,001 --> 00:11:35,302
He's cooking?

256
00:11:35,336 --> 00:11:38,038
Wow. You ready?

257
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,974
What, for food?
Yeah, I think I can handle it.

258
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:43,010
Uh, no, for sex.

259
00:11:43,044 --> 00:11:44,978
What? N--grow up.

260
00:11:45,013 --> 00:11:48,582
Oh, give me break.
How many dates have you had?
This'll be three.

261
00:11:48,616 --> 00:11:51,418
Oh, yeah. Yeah, third date's
the sex date.

262
00:11:51,452 --> 00:11:54,554
And he'sooking for you...
At his home...

263
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:56,857
Where he keeps his bed.

264
00:11:56,891 --> 00:11:58,692
I barely know the man.

265
00:11:58,726 --> 00:12:01,628
Well, you're gonna know him
a lot better tomorrow.

266
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:05,232
(laughs) there is nothing magic
about a third date.

267
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,701
It is possible to eat
and go home

268
00:12:07,735 --> 00:12:10,103
And not lose your pants
in the process.

269
00:12:10,138 --> 00:12:11,738
Okay.

270
00:12:13,273 --> 00:12:16,608
Uh, but if it does go that way,
am I supposed to sleep over?

271
00:12:16,643 --> 00:12:19,111
Oh, no. No.
Sex on the couch.

272
00:12:19,145 --> 00:12:22,014
Walk of shame to the car
under cover of darkness.

273
00:12:22,748 --> 00:12:24,315
Do I wear a dress?

274
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:27,118
Unh-unh. Casual, like--like you
don't expect it's gonna happen,

275
00:12:27,152 --> 00:12:30,221
But you're ready
for it to happen.
Oh. How ready?

276
00:12:30,256 --> 00:12:34,959
Like... You've prepped
the surgical field...

277
00:12:34,994 --> 00:12:36,394
The sur--

278
00:12:36,428 --> 00:12:38,830
(gasps) oh, torres.

279
00:12:38,864 --> 00:12:41,099
There is a ukrainian woman

280
00:12:41,133 --> 00:12:44,903
Who works at the manicure place
across the street.

281
00:12:45,937 --> 00:12:47,471
Shwi take care of you.

282
00:12:47,505 --> 00:12:50,040
You...

283
00:12:50,074 --> 00:12:51,742
Mm-hmm.

284
00:12:51,776 --> 00:12:53,243
(crinkles paper)

285
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:54,578
Oh!

286
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,447
(ultrasound whooshing)

287
00:12:57,482 --> 00:12:59,850
(man) you sure it's okay
to give him this much medicine

288
00:12:59,884 --> 00:13:02,853
When we don't know
what's wrong with him?
Okay,
it's not gonna hurt him.

289
00:13:02,887 --> 00:13:06,089
He needed a painkiller, jim.
I'm telling you, he needed it.

290
00:13:06,124 --> 00:13:09,459
Upper right chest
and k.U.B. Are negative.
Go get him set up

291
00:13:09,494 --> 00:13:12,195
For a c.T. With contrast.
Okay.

292
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,031
How could this have happened?

293
00:13:14,065 --> 00:13:15,432
(whooshing continues)

294
00:13:16,066 --> 00:13:18,968
Just say it.
You think I missed something.
Honey, I don't.

295
00:13:19,003 --> 00:13:21,804
I--
yes, you do. Just admit it.

296
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,042
Okay, fine. Fine. I mean, how
do you miss a fever this high?
Guys,
this isn't gonna help.

297
00:13:26,076 --> 00:13:29,379
Kids get sick.
It's no one's fault.
(womanyes, it is.
It's my fault.

298
00:13:29,413 --> 00:13:32,048
Oh, kelly, don't.
If you had been with him
and this happened,

299
00:13:32,082 --> 00:13:33,483
I'd be blaming you.

300
00:13:33,517 --> 00:13:35,718
I would kill you if you had him
and this happened.

301
00:13:35,753 --> 00:13:37,554
Okay. I need
to get him in the c.T.

302
00:13:37,588 --> 00:13:40,056
I've also added an I.V.
Antibiotic because he's septic,

303
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:42,425
And I want to make sure
that we've covered everything.

304
00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:44,894
Maybe he ate something
off the ground?

305
00:13:44,929 --> 00:13:47,864
Oh, god.
I was watching him!

306
00:13:49,398 --> 00:13:51,700
Audrey taylor's
latest l.F.T.S

307
00:13:51,734 --> 00:13:54,335
Thank you.

308
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:56,304
Dr. Altman.

309
00:13:56,338 --> 00:13:59,107
I, uh, set aside
some saline implants

310
00:13:59,141 --> 00:14:00,608
For your
post-pneumonectomy patient.

311
00:14:00,643 --> 00:14:02,510
I have a couple on hand.

312
00:14:02,545 --> 00:14:04,779
Size-wise, you won't really
know what you need

313
00:14:04,814 --> 00:14:06,681
Until you're in there.
(elevator bell dings)

314
00:14:06,716 --> 00:14:08,650
Can you scrub in
place them for me?

315
00:14:08,684 --> 00:14:10,185
Sure.

316
00:14:10,219 --> 00:14:12,954
You know, I was, um...

317
00:14:13,988 --> 00:14:17,098
I--well, I-I may actually
be free tonight a-after work.

318
00:14:17,099 --> 00:14:18,593
Really?
Yeah.

319
00:14:18,627 --> 00:14:21,662
That's fantastic.
There's a new italian restaurant

320
00:14:21,697 --> 00:14:23,764
I've been--
I've been meaning to try.

321
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:26,567
Maybe you and I can--
oh, well, joe's is--
is probably fine.

322
00:14:26,602 --> 00:14:28,869
<i>For dinner?
No.</i>

323
00:14:28,904 --> 00:14:31,939
I mean... (laughs)
well, I, you know, I...

324
00:14:31,974 --> 00:14:34,175
For a-a drink
and then--and then--

325
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:36,110
I was asking you to dinner

326
00:14:36,144 --> 00:14:39,247
Sohat we could talk
and get to know each other.

327
00:14:39,281 --> 00:14:40,748
That sort of thing.

328
00:14:40,782 --> 00:14:43,684
Oh, though, that--that's--
that's not--

329
00:14:43,719 --> 00:14:45,653
I mean, I-I thought that...

330
00:14:45,687 --> 00:14:47,488
You know... (chuckles)

331
00:14:47,522 --> 00:14:49,857
I-I'm not ailable
for dinner.

332
00:14:49,891 --> 00:14:52,293
I-I--I'm--I'm sorry.

333
00:14:52,327 --> 00:14:55,329
Sloan. Sloan. What are you--
what are you doing?

334
00:14:55,364 --> 00:14:57,331
Apparently nothing.

335
00:14:57,366 --> 00:15:00,701
Teddy... Teddy is not
one of these women that you...

336
00:15:00,736 --> 00:15:02,637
You--you can't just
treat her--

337
00:15:02,671 --> 00:15:04,705
This may come
as a shock to you,

338
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,707
But it looks like
I'm the respectful adult

339
00:15:06,742 --> 00:15:08,509
In this particular situation.

340
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:12,246
<i>So how about you talk to her
about how she treats people?</i>

341
00:15:12,281 --> 00:15:14,715
(elevator bell dings)

342
00:15:23,273 --> 00:15:26,408
How genius is this?
Mark sloan and teddy.

343
00:15:26,443 --> 00:15:29,411
Are you serious?
I just said that.
Mm. Shut up.

344
00:15:29,446 --> 00:15:32,515
Are we so well matched that
we have all the same thoughts?

345
00:15:32,549 --> 00:15:33,949
It's kinda crazy...

346
00:15:33,984 --> 00:15:36,418
(singsongy)
but it's kinda great.
(laughs) I'm just saying.

347
00:15:36,453 --> 00:15:39,321
(laughs)
teddy needs someone to come in
and clear out the cobwebs

348
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:41,724
And just put a little spring
back in her step.

349
00:15:41,758 --> 00:15:45,027
Yeah, and father her children.
Yeah. W-wait, wait. What?
No. Mark?

350
00:15:45,061 --> 00:15:47,530
Yeah. He--he wants a wife
and kids.

351
00:15:47,564 --> 00:15:50,633
(mouth full) well, I told her
he was a candy bar.
What?

352
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:52,101
(whispers) I didn't know.

353
00:15:52,135 --> 00:15:54,737
(grunts)

354
00:15:54,771 --> 00:15:56,705
First she said no.
Then she said s.

355
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,908
Ooh, that's good.
And then she said no again,

356
00:15:58,942 --> 00:16:01,677
Because she doesn't want
to have a meal with me.

357
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:04,613
She just wanted sex. I mean,
who treats people like that--

358
00:16:04,648 --> 00:16:09,451
Like an object,
a piece of ass?
Well, um, I think you do.

359
00:16:09,486 --> 00:16:14,552
I've changed.
Dr. Sloan, altman says if you're
scrubbing in, it's at 2:00.

360
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:16,529
Thanks, karev.

361
00:16:16,564 --> 00:16:17,962
You're a good man.

362
00:16:17,997 --> 00:16:18,761
(clears throat)

363
00:16:18,795 --> 00:16:20,996
(sugarush beat company)
âª "l" is love, it's love âª

364
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:24,181
Hey.

365
00:16:24,215 --> 00:16:25,616
(lowered voice) not here.

366
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:26,797
Sloan's going
all psycho killer on me--

367
00:16:26,798 --> 00:16:28,153
Smiles and crazy eyes.

368
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,822
I don't know what the hell
he's gonna do.

369
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:33,324
What, I'm still his property?
I'll talk to him.

370
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,260
Don't, don't.
I gotta operate with the guy.

371
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:39,697
You mess with him, he might
stab me with a scalpel.

372
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:42,100
(speaking indistinctly)
ugh.

373
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:44,636
Mark's trying to kill alex.

374
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,805
(mouth full) what?
Well, I think I mentioned

375
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,706
Sleeping with alex
was a bad idea.

376
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:51,309
No, it's not a bad idea.
It's happy and easy.

377
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:55,278
You know how much
mental energy mark took up?

378
00:16:55,313 --> 00:16:56,961
You know, I-I am telling you,
ending it

379
00:16:56,996 --> 00:16:58,932
Is the best thing that coulda
happened to me, and for him.

380
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:01,518
Do you know
how much happier he'd be

381
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:04,188
If he could just move on?
Looked to  like he was
trying to pick up teddy.

382
00:17:04,222 --> 00:17:06,223
Mm?
Well, sure.
Oh, he'll sleep with her.

383
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:08,692
He slept with addison.
He'll screw anything that moves.

384
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:10,828
But what, I'm supposed
to check into a convent?

385
00:17:10,862 --> 00:17:15,495
Why is he hanging on like this?
You're just that good,
little grey.

386
00:17:15,633 --> 00:17:17,734
There's no getting over you.

387
00:17:17,768 --> 00:17:19,736
âª "l" is love, it's love âª

388
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,237
Oh...

389
00:17:21,272 --> 00:17:24,040
You clear the room.
Every time, you clear the room.
(laughs)

390
00:17:24,674 --> 00:17:27,243
Grey, uh, audrey taylor
is getting a new set of scans.

391
00:17:27,277 --> 00:17:29,912
Could you have a look
an see if there's anything

392
00:17:29,946 --> 00:17:32,948
We need to include
for the presentation?
Hey, um,
how's the plan coming?

393
00:17:32,983 --> 00:17:35,551
Oh, good. I think if I clamp
the aorta and the vena cava

394
00:17:35,585 --> 00:17:37,987
Above and below the liver
and the porta hepatis,

395
00:17:38,021 --> 00:17:39,989
I should be able
to carve out the tumor.

396
00:17:40,023 --> 00:17:42,925
Hmm. Interesting.

397
00:17:42,959 --> 00:17:45,261
So, uh, what's the word
from the other side?

398
00:17:45,295 --> 00:17:47,296
Oh, from dr. Webber?

399
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,732
Uh... Not much.

400
00:17:49,766 --> 00:17:52,668
He, um... He's still
kind of flailing.

401
00:17:53,702 --> 00:17:55,670
Fl-flailing, really?

402
00:17:55,704 --> 00:17:57,572
Yeah, it's sad.

403
00:17:57,606 --> 00:17:59,974
You know, old guy,
end of the road.

404
00:18:00,009 --> 00:18:03,011
Mm-h.
Webber doesn't flail.

405
00:18:03,045 --> 00:18:06,314
You know, I'm gonna go
and see if I can help him

406
00:18:06,348 --> 00:18:08,516
Come up with something.
(owen chuckles)

407
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,251
Uh--
he flipped her.

408
00:18:10,286 --> 00:18:13,855
We have to get those scans
before she does.
Yeah, let's go.

409
00:18:13,889 --> 00:18:15,390
Ah, dr. Bailey.

410
00:18:15,424 --> 00:18:18,426
I'm about to do a consult.
Would you like to join me?
Uh, lunchtime.

411
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,428
Yes, but all the years
I've known you,

412
00:18:20,462 --> 00:18:22,063
I've never seen you eat.

413
00:18:22,097 --> 00:18:24,465
I do things at lunchtime.
What things?

414
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,435
Errands--to the dentist, to get
a haircut--no, not a haircut.

415
00:18:27,469 --> 00:18:30,538
I'm going out. Does that
require an interrogation?

416
00:18:30,572 --> 00:18:31,506
Is that the kind of chief
you want to be?

417
00:18:31,506 --> 00:18:33,614
Is that the kind of man
you want to be?
No.

418
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:35,203
I didn't think so.

419
00:18:36,878 --> 00:18:38,779
Take a deep breath.

420
00:18:38,814 --> 00:18:40,648
(inhales and exhales deeply)

421
00:18:40,682 --> 00:18:43,546
Hey, doc, my parents
got married really young,

422
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:45,218
And they freakin'
hated each other

423
00:18:45,253 --> 00:18:48,121
By the time I was born.
Sorry to hear that.

424
00:18:48,156 --> 00:18:50,023
Molly thinks
shacking up's all cute,

425
00:18:50,058 --> 00:18:52,826
But I don't think you play
around with something like that.

426
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,063
You know,
people can get hurt.
You really don't need
to explain.

427
00:18:56,097 --> 00:18:57,531
You think I'm a turd,

428
00:18:57,565 --> 00:19:00,667
And you're getting ready to
slice me open with a knife.

429
00:19:00,701 --> 00:19:02,636
(sighs)

430
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:05,338
I'm sure you're not a turd.

431
00:19:06,908 --> 00:19:09,776
I think we found our problem.

432
00:19:09,811 --> 00:19:12,145
Noah had a cyst on his liver,
and it ruptured,

433
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:15,082
And that's what's causing
so much pain.
A cyst?
Why would he have a cyst?

434
00:19:15,116 --> 00:19:17,017
(lexie) they can be
congenital or infectious.

435
00:19:17,051 --> 00:19:19,719
They're usually benign, but they
can rupture with pressure.

436
00:19:19,754 --> 00:19:22,122
Pressure?
What kind of pressure?

437
00:19:22,156 --> 00:19:25,792
You mean like a fall? Did--
did noah take a fall today?
No.

438
00:19:25,827 --> 00:19:28,695
Okay, the truth is, it doesn't
matter what caused the rupture.

439
00:19:28,729 --> 00:19:31,131
What matters is that
we operate right away.

440
00:19:31,165 --> 00:19:33,800
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
We were doing bear hugs.

441
00:19:33,835 --> 00:19:35,836
We were--I-I hugged him.

442
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,904
I hugged him hard.

443
00:19:37,939 --> 00:19:41,541
That's when--
that's what did this?
(monitor beeping erratically)

444
00:19:41,576 --> 00:19:44,444
(jim) noah? Noah?
What's happening?
(kelly) no!

445
00:19:44,479 --> 00:19:47,047
(jim) noah.
Grey, get an o.R.
We're going now.

446
00:19:47,081 --> 00:19:49,182
(cries)

447
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:55,236
I've done this 300 times,
and it's still not working.

448
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,171
I went to eugenia.

449
00:19:57,205 --> 00:19:59,173
Mm.

450
00:19:59,207 --> 00:20:01,731
She held up two postage stamps

451
00:20:01,766 --> 00:20:06,158
And ked me if was looking
for the 44-cent or the 3.

452
00:20:06,193 --> 00:20:08,948
Um, you don't have to tell me
which one you picked.
I left!

453
00:20:08,983 --> 00:20:11,251
Look... Look, let me tell you
a little something

454
00:20:11,285 --> 00:20:13,186
About my surgical field.
Okay?

455
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:16,155
I prep my surgical field
with soap and water.

456
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:19,459
I keep my surgical field
the way god made it. Okay?

457
00:20:19,493 --> 00:20:22,428
I don't need a member
of the ukrainian k.G.B.

458
00:20:22,463 --> 00:20:25,465
Waxing it smooth
so that it can be mistaken

459
00:20:25,499 --> 00:20:28,034
For the surgical field
of a 5-year-old girl.

460
00:20:28,068 --> 00:20:30,985
I am a woman, and a woman

461
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:35,140
<i>Was meant to have something on
her surgical field.</i>

462
00:20:35,174 --> 00:20:37,476
If a man can't deal
with a little something

463
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,944
On the surgical field,

464
00:20:38,978 --> 00:20:41,513
A little nature, a little god,

465
00:20:42,147 --> 00:20:45,917
Then that man has no business
getting near my surgical field.

466
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,886
Fine. I'm not putting
a gun to your head.

467
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,787
Let freedom ring.

468
00:20:49,822 --> 00:20:53,191
Damn it. This is not
supposed to be liquid.

469
00:20:53,225 --> 00:20:54,559
(sighs)

470
00:20:54,593 --> 00:20:57,395
(exhales)

471
00:20:58,831 --> 00:21:01,733
(voice breaking) what if
I'm not cut out for this?

472
00:21:01,767 --> 00:21:04,602
You know, what if I'm
no longer... Patient enough

473
00:21:04,637 --> 00:21:09,086
Or stupid enough
to deal with this crap?

474
00:21:15,346 --> 00:21:16,713
Come here.

475
00:21:16,747 --> 00:21:18,181
Come here.
(whimpers)

476
00:21:18,215 --> 00:21:20,517
Come here.
(chuckles)

477
00:21:20,551 --> 00:21:22,252
You can do this.

478
00:21:22,286 --> 00:21:25,955
<i>You can do this.
You can.
(chuckles)</i>

479
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,624
This cyst was massive.

480
00:21:27,658 --> 00:21:29,592
We're gonna
have to do a chole

481
00:21:29,627 --> 00:21:32,128
'cause of
the intrabiliary pressure.
Should I update his parents?

482
00:21:32,163 --> 00:21:34,597
It's gonna take a lot longer
than we said.

483
00:21:34,632 --> 00:21:36,699
Uh, yeah, sure.
That's a good idea.

484
00:21:36,734 --> 00:21:38,735
What do I tell them?
Doesn't matter.

485
00:21:38,769 --> 00:21:40,570
I'm sorry?

486
00:21:40,604 --> 00:21:43,106
Until you can say
he's awake and he's fine,

487
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,208
They won't hear a word.

488
00:21:45,242 --> 00:21:47,677
They'll just hear white noise
and see your mouth moving.

489
00:21:47,711 --> 00:21:49,810
But go. It's good for them
to see you.

490
00:21:49,814 --> 00:21:51,782
Try to keep your face happy.

491
00:21:51,816 --> 00:21:54,618
(suction gurgles)

492
00:21:57,622 --> 00:22:01,591
Jackson avery.
Put him on our team.
Hey, are you stacking
the deck again?

493
00:22:01,626 --> 00:22:04,661
You're a spy. Don't think
that I don't know it.
And who started that boulder
rolling down the hill?

494
00:22:04,695 --> 00:22:06,630
Okay, okay, okay.
I'm switzerland in this moment.

495
00:22:06,664 --> 00:22:09,666
All I'm saying is that whoever
gets the surgery should use him.

496
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,568
Use me for what?
He's a liability.

497
00:22:11,602 --> 00:22:14,538
Avery is not gonna give
the award to his own grandson.
Unh-unh. I don't think--

498
00:22:14,572 --> 00:22:16,473
He won't be named
a contributor.

499
00:22:16,507 --> 00:22:18,909
It'll just get mentioned
over thanksgiving...
No. No, I won't.

500
00:22:18,943 --> 00:22:21,378
That he worked on a tumor
the size of a possum.
What's going on?

501
00:22:21,412 --> 00:22:23,713
They're fighting over me.
Or more the idea of me.

502
00:22:23,748 --> 00:22:26,383
I don't really think that--
he's harper avery bait.

503
00:22:26,417 --> 00:22:28,952
(meredith)
derek's waiting for us.

504
00:22:28,986 --> 00:22:31,254
Okay, the heart
is back where it came from.

505
00:22:31,289 --> 00:22:33,623
Dr. Sloan?

506
00:22:33,658 --> 00:22:35,091
(mark) two c's.

507
00:22:35,126 --> 00:22:37,194
You're just
gonna eyeball it?

508
00:22:37,228 --> 00:22:38,695
This is what I do.

509
00:22:38,729 --> 00:22:40,263
If you say so.

510
00:22:40,298 --> 00:22:42,132
Syringe.

511
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:46,202
Whoa. What, are you afraid
I'm gonna stab you?

512
00:22:46,236 --> 00:22:48,437
No needle.

513
00:22:48,471 --> 00:22:51,135
(monitor beeping erratically)
he's hypotensive.

514
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,341
Your implants are sitting
on the vena cava.

515
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:56,780
There's too much fluid.
No, there's not.
Just need to reposition it.

516
00:22:56,979 --> 00:22:58,713
Relax.

517
00:22:58,747 --> 00:23:00,114
Thank you.

518
00:23:00,149 --> 00:23:02,584
An abdominal entry
is a shot in the dark.

519
00:23:02,618 --> 00:23:05,086
The tumor has shoved
everything out of place.

520
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,454
The anatomy's a mess.

521
00:23:06,488 --> 00:23:09,557
Now I'm proposing
a thoracoabdominalpproach.

522
00:23:09,592 --> 00:23:12,227
You want to go in
through the chest?

523
00:23:12,261 --> 00:23:14,162
It's risky, yes,
but not as risky

524
00:23:14,196 --> 00:23:19,002
As "I'll open up the abdomen
and take a good look around."
snap.

525
00:23:19,034 --> 00:23:21,835
You may end up seeding
the tumor in the lungs.

526
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:24,271
That is a danger, yes.

527
00:23:25,907 --> 00:23:28,108
Impressive proposal.

528
00:23:28,143 --> 00:23:31,445
It's very...

529
00:23:31,479 --> 00:23:32,880
Hmm.

530
00:23:32,914 --> 00:23:36,784
I think I feel more comfortable
with dr. Hunt's plan.

531
00:23:36,818 --> 00:23:39,720
He doesn't have a plan.
He has an attitude.

532
00:23:39,754 --> 00:23:41,088
It's more improvisational.

533
00:23:41,122 --> 00:23:45,426
But given our situation,
I think it's our best bet.

534
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,461
Thanks, all of you.

535
00:23:47,495 --> 00:23:49,196
(owen) thank you.

536
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:51,398
(door opens)

537
00:23:51,433 --> 00:23:52,833
(blows air)

538
00:23:52,867 --> 00:23:54,368
(door closes)

539
00:23:54,402 --> 00:23:56,637
Richard, uh...

540
00:24:01,108 --> 00:24:03,008
I'm sorry.
It was a good plan.

541
00:24:03,043 --> 00:24:05,411
Hunt's just makes
more sense to me.

542
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:07,880
Yes, because that's the way
you'd do it.

543
00:24:07,914 --> 00:24:09,348
That's your style.

544
00:24:09,382 --> 00:24:12,852
Let me tell you
about your new job.

545
00:24:12,886 --> 00:24:14,720
You manage surgeons.

546
00:24:14,754 --> 00:24:18,124
<i>Your job is to help them do
what they do</i>

547
00:24:18,158 --> 00:24:20,359
<i>The way they do it.</i>

548
00:24:20,393 --> 00:24:23,295
<i>Not to get them to do
what you would do.</i>

549
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:26,532
It takes vision, derek.

550
00:24:26,566 --> 00:24:28,834
And you don't have it.

551
00:24:34,047 --> 00:24:35,814
(monitor beeping erratically)
(alex) b.P.'s still low.

552
00:24:35,848 --> 00:24:38,016
Dr. Sloan.
When people rush you,
does it usually help?

553
00:24:38,051 --> 00:24:40,485
No, but it would be nice
if we didn't let him die.
I feel the same way.

554
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,487
And you thought
we had nothing in common.

555
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:45,711
(monitor beeping rhythmically)
pressure's coming back up.

556
00:24:45,746 --> 00:24:47,092
Imagine.

557
00:24:50,761 --> 00:24:52,295
(teddy) dr. Sloan.

558
00:24:52,329 --> 00:24:54,831
Nice work.

559
00:24:54,865 --> 00:24:56,266
What, that?

560
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,668
Just a hobby.

561
00:24:59,702 --> 00:25:03,438
Professionally,
I'm more focused on my work

562
00:25:03,473 --> 00:25:06,074
As a male escort.

563
00:25:06,109 --> 00:25:07,609
(door opens and closes)

564
00:25:09,412 --> 00:25:11,880
We will isolate the tumor
from the blood vessels

565
00:25:11,914 --> 00:25:13,882
That supply it,

566
00:25:13,916 --> 00:25:16,485
And then try to extract it.

567
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:19,354
That's the plan? You'll try?

568
00:25:19,389 --> 00:25:23,392
Is that a plan?
I wish that I could be
more specific, but, uh...

569
00:25:23,426 --> 00:25:25,494
Until we know
what we're dealing with--

570
00:25:25,528 --> 00:25:29,197
No, no, no. That's not a plan.
That's a death sentence.

571
00:25:29,232 --> 00:25:32,834
Audrey
mrs. Taylor, if this works,
it is not just a month.

572
00:25:32,869 --> 00:25:34,870
It is a long time.

573
00:25:34,904 --> 00:25:37,205
It's a gamble.
It's a huge one.

574
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,609
You are gambling away
my daughter's wedding.
Well, then, you know what?
I'll call kim right now,

575
00:25:40,643 --> 00:25:42,544
And she'll get
a justice of the peace,

576
00:25:42,578 --> 00:25:44,913
And she and scott could get
married right here in this room,

577
00:25:44,947 --> 00:25:46,982
And then we could
stop bothering these men.
Don--

578
00:25:47,016 --> 00:25:48,950
You know, you-ou don't
even like weddings.

579
00:25:48,985 --> 00:25:51,553
The salmon will be too dry
and the flowers

580
00:25:51,587 --> 00:25:53,955
Will make you sneeze,
and kim will be angry at you

581
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:56,558
Because women get angry at their
mothers at their weddings

582
00:25:56,592 --> 00:25:59,061
Because that's how
they handle their stress.
Stop it.

583
00:25:59,095 --> 00:26:01,563
Do you think that she cares
about her wedding?

584
00:26:01,597 --> 00:26:03,765
Her mother is dying.
Don.

585
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:08,170
They're trying to offer you
a life--a whole, long life.

586
00:26:08,204 --> 00:26:10,105
And, no,
they can't guarantee it,

587
00:26:10,139 --> 00:26:12,040
And they're not gonna know
what they're gonna find,

588
00:26:12,075 --> 00:26:13,475
And it's a gamble.

589
00:26:13,509 --> 00:26:16,812
But how can you not take that
chance, because of a wedding?

590
00:26:21,724 --> 00:26:26,791
There'll be grandkids
and--and arguments

591
00:26:26,826 --> 00:26:30,485
And god knows what else,
and she'll need you for those.

592
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:35,461
And I'll need you.

593
00:26:35,495 --> 00:26:37,229
(cries)

594
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:43,369
Your husband's right.

595
00:26:43,403 --> 00:26:46,772
And so is dr. Hunt.

596
00:26:46,806 --> 00:26:50,008
He can't foresee
what he'll find in surgery.

597
00:26:50,043 --> 00:26:53,445
But he'll solve that
as it comes.

598
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,347
That's the plan.

599
00:26:56,816 --> 00:26:59,017
And it's a good one.

600
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:17,202
He did great.

601
00:27:17,237 --> 00:27:20,005
Oh. Oh.
He's just coming out
from under anesthesia.

602
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:22,775
And he's probably gonna be in
a little pain from the surgery,

603
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:25,844
But... He's gonna be fine.
Is this gonna happen again?

604
00:27:25,879 --> 00:27:28,547
It's possible that he'll
develop a cyst iv the future,

605
00:27:28,581 --> 00:27:31,150
So you're gonna have to keep
an eye out.
This was...

606
00:27:31,184 --> 00:27:34,186
I hugged himdo I not hug him?
Do we not wrestle?

607
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:37,189
You don't throw him
on the ground.
Well, he's a boy.
He likes to wrestle.

608
00:27:37,223 --> 00:27:39,191
It's not like
I initiate it.

609
00:27:39,225 --> 00:27:41,093
Of course you hug him.

610
00:27:41,127 --> 00:27:43,028
And you wrestle.
You live your lives.

611
00:27:43,062 --> 00:27:45,431
And if he happens to be
in any great pain,

612
00:27:45,465 --> 00:27:48,233
Then you know what--
so there isn't any kind
of preventative thing that--

613
00:27:48,268 --> 00:27:49,935
Please let her finish.

614
00:27:49,969 --> 00:27:52,204
It's okay.

615
00:27:52,238 --> 00:27:54,239
I was done.

616
00:27:54,274 --> 00:27:55,307
(sighs)

617
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:58,243
Are you ready
to see him?

618
00:27:58,278 --> 00:27:59,912
Yeah.

619
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:13,757
Hmm. Somebody paged me here.

620
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:15,993
Shh.

621
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,861
Condoms.

622
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:22,432
I'm building cartilage...
From jell-o,

623
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:23,834
And you paged me for--

624
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:26,270
Condoms.
(whispers) they have them
in the clinic.

625
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:29,506
No, no. Am I supposed
to bring them?

626
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,643
Oh. (laughs) oh, miranda.
(whimpers)

627
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:35,245
(normal voice) yeah, yh.
Um... Guy brings the condoms.

628
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,048
Okay.
Anyhow, I would've pegged you
for the diaphragm type.

629
00:28:38,082 --> 00:28:40,217
Well, I have a diaphragm.

630
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:42,252
Diaphragms
prevent pregnancies.

631
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:43,687
They don't protect against

632
00:28:43,721 --> 00:28:45,222
The raft of
sexually transmitted diseases.

633
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:48,075
You're a physician. Am I really
explaining this to you?

634
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,392
I got it. I got it.

635
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:51,761
Okay. You know what?
Look, guy brings the condoms,

636
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:53,638
But sometimes they fail to
provide them on the third date

637
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:55,032
As a sign of respect.

638
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,501
"oh, I never imagined
this would happen so soon.

639
00:28:57,535 --> 00:28:59,469
Oh, I wasn't prepared."
so you know what?

640
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:01,571
You should bring 'em.
Always bring 'em.

641
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:03,440
Why trust the guy, right?
Right. Right. All right.

642
00:29:03,474 --> 00:29:05,309
All right.
Torres.

643
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:07,477
Hmm?
(mutters)

644
00:29:09,012 --> 00:29:10,345
Come on.

645
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,847
I can't. I--
you can.

646
00:29:11,881 --> 00:29:14,116
Walk into the clinic and take
some condoms out of the box.

647
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:16,151
Don't make me ask you twice.

648
00:29:16,186 --> 00:29:18,687
I'm having trouble telling
liver from tumor.

649
00:29:18,721 --> 00:29:20,789
Yep, you and me both.

650
00:29:20,824 --> 00:29:22,825
<i>(owen) clamp.</i>

651
00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:24,793
(richard) sorry
you didn't end up

652
00:29:24,828 --> 00:29:26,728
On the winning team, yang.

653
00:29:26,763 --> 00:29:29,131
Oh, sucks. You made
a ballsy play, though.

654
00:29:29,165 --> 00:29:30,532
Thoracoabdominal entry?

655
00:29:30,567 --> 00:29:32,401
Well, I do what I can
to keep it fresh.

656
00:29:32,435 --> 00:29:34,636
<i>Bring in the cusa.
Hang another unit
of f.F.P.</i>

657
00:29:34,671 --> 00:29:36,939
<i>(jackson) need more laps.
More, more.</i>

658
00:29:36,973 --> 00:29:39,074
<i>(monitor beeping rhymically)</i>

659
00:29:39,108 --> 00:29:41,777
<i>Hey, you guys need some help?
(owen) where's webber?</i>

660
00:29:41,811 --> 00:29:44,780
<i>You want me to scrub in?
I need webber.
Where's webber?</i>

661
00:29:46,314 --> 00:29:47,917
I just helped altman
save her patient.

662
00:29:48,017 --> 00:29:50,206
I don't know why I bothered.
She thinks I'm a piece of meat.

663
00:29:50,087 --> 00:29:52,555
Look, there's plenty of women
dying to settle down.

664
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,491
You just gotta move on
to the next one.

665
00:29:54,525 --> 00:29:58,763
Uh, try, uh, what's her name
in, uh, derm?
Dinner and a conversation.
Can't wait.

666
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:02,159
Who said dinner? Lunch.
No, lunch is not romantic.

667
00:30:02,194 --> 00:30:03,365
Well,
you don't want romantic.

668
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,870
You want daylight and public

669
00:30:04,905 --> 00:30:06,601
So you can, you know,
get to know each other.

670
00:30:06,636 --> 00:30:09,335
That is the least sexy thing
I've ever heard in my life.

671
00:30:09,336 --> 00:30:10,781
You've had sex.
You don't want sex.

672
00:30:10,816 --> 00:30:12,841
You want a baby.
No, there's no way
this works.

673
00:30:12,876 --> 00:30:15,910
God, is it really possible
that you're this insecure?

674
00:30:15,944 --> 00:30:17,779
You're not just
a sex machine, mark.

675
00:30:17,813 --> 00:30:20,314
I mean, look, don't get me
wrong. You've got skills.

676
00:30:20,349 --> 00:30:22,150
But you're a good person.
Why do you think

677
00:30:22,184 --> 00:30:24,552
Little miss muffet
fell for you?
Lexie left.

678
00:30:24,586 --> 00:30:26,521
Well, because she was
too young.

679
00:30:26,555 --> 00:30:28,790
It was about her, not you.

680
00:30:28,824 --> 00:30:31,626
(sighs) wow. You really don't
believe any of this, do you?

681
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,761
Okay. Listen...
(sighs)

682
00:30:33,796 --> 00:30:35,296
You're a good guy.

683
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,965
You're worth
getting to know...

684
00:30:37,999 --> 00:30:40,601
Hispers) in daylight.

685
00:30:44,338 --> 00:30:46,272
This is not gonna work,
dr. Hunt.

686
00:30:46,306 --> 00:30:48,240
The chest isn't an option
anymore, richard.

687
00:30:48,275 --> 00:30:51,477
This is what we've got.
I'm not pitching my solution.

688
00:30:51,511 --> 00:30:54,747
I'm saying we should think
a minute.
Okay, I've isolated
the blood supply

689
00:30:54,781 --> 00:30:57,149
And mobilized the liver,
but I can't get enough exposure

690
00:30:57,184 --> 00:31:00,086
To get to the tumor.
What if we lift the liver up
and give you more visibility?

691
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,088
Well, that would help
with the periphery,

692
00:31:02,122 --> 00:31:05,391
But I can't--I still
have to deal with the vessels.

693
00:31:05,425 --> 00:31:08,728
I wish we could take--
just take the damn thing out.
Well, why not?

694
00:31:08,762 --> 00:31:10,763
Let's take the liver out.

695
00:31:10,797 --> 00:31:13,032
I can clean off the tumor
ex vivo.

696
00:31:13,066 --> 00:31:15,234
You can work on the vascular
supply in the cavity.

697
00:31:15,268 --> 00:31:18,137
Will it work?
No one's
ever tried that before.

698
00:31:18,171 --> 00:31:21,307
She's crashing. If you're trying
something, now is the time.

699
00:31:21,341 --> 00:31:25,311
Hunt.
(monitor beeping erratically)

700
00:31:25,345 --> 00:31:27,246
Okay, extracting the liver.

701
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,949
Okay, let's go.
Okay, more laps.

702
00:31:29,983 --> 00:31:33,519
Suction. A lot of suction.
Hurry.
(beeping continues)

703
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:42,374
The surgery went great.

704
00:31:42,374 --> 00:31:44,724
Everything is back where it should
be. And todd's gonna be fine.

705
00:31:44,725 --> 00:31:47,567
Oh, my god. Thank you. Do you
think I should go see him?

706
00:31:47,567 --> 00:31:49,461
Well, he's still
a bit groggy.

707
00:31:49,461 --> 00:31:51,436
I mean, do you think
he wants to see me

708
00:31:51,436 --> 00:31:54,776
After I stormed out? How did
he seem? Did he seem upset or...

709
00:31:55,624 --> 00:31:59,930
I just... I love him.
And I was a little crazy.

710
00:31:59,965 --> 00:32:02,462
I mean, he practically had
a heart attack or whatever,

711
00:32:02,496 --> 00:32:04,297
And I-I acted a little crazy.

712
00:32:05,332 --> 00:32:07,299
When you feel like
you love someone

713
00:32:07,334 --> 00:32:08,901
More than he loves you,

714
00:32:08,935 --> 00:32:12,538
That can make you
a little crazy.

715
00:32:12,572 --> 00:32:16,208
It can make you
a lot crazy.

716
00:32:18,712 --> 00:32:21,380
You know, webber really
came up with the idea

717
00:32:21,414 --> 00:32:23,048
To take out the liver.

718
00:32:23,083 --> 00:32:27,286
Maybe if owen, uh, agreed
to take his name off of it.
Will you give it up?

719
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,221
Hunt was
more than halfway done

720
00:32:29,256 --> 00:32:32,091
By the time the idea
even surfaced.

721
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:33,993
There's no harper avery.
Waste.

722
00:32:34,027 --> 00:32:36,125
No, it's not a waste.

723
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,326
It's exactly what
my grandfather had in mind

724
00:32:38,361 --> 00:32:40,032
When he came up
with the stupid thing--

725
00:32:40,066 --> 00:32:41,967
Find some way
to keep surgeons motivated,

726
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:44,661
Make them take it
to the next level

727
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,667
Even if they're already
at the top of their game.

728
00:32:46,702 --> 00:32:49,742
And that's exactly
what it did today.

729
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,626
This message
was brought to you

730
00:32:52,661 --> 00:32:54,680
By the harper avery foundation
of america.
(laughs)

731
00:32:54,714 --> 00:32:57,883
Donations to the foundation
can be made at www.Nepotism--
you're kind of a bitch.
You know that?

732
00:32:57,918 --> 00:33:01,613
What?
It was inspiring.

733
00:33:01,648 --> 00:33:03,420
Mrs. Taylor's gonna need
a post-op note.

734
00:33:03,455 --> 00:33:05,055
I'll do it.

735
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:07,525
(laughs)

736
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:10,461
Good work today, grey.
We're a good team.

737
00:33:11,897 --> 00:33:13,798
You know, we're not a team.

738
00:33:13,832 --> 00:33:17,268
Cristina and I are a team.

739
00:33:17,302 --> 00:33:20,137
I watched you today...
Watch teddy and mark.

740
00:33:20,172 --> 00:33:23,828
I was... (exhales)
she's my friend,

741
00:33:23,863 --> 00:33:25,855
And mark sloan
is a public health hazard.

742
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:27,978
You were jealous.

743
00:33:28,012 --> 00:33:30,881
It took a long time
to make her happy.

744
00:33:30,915 --> 00:33:32,516
And she's finally happy.

745
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:34,284
And if you mess with that,

746
00:33:34,318 --> 00:33:36,186
<i>I will turn on you.</i>

747
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,855
That's a team.

748
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:41,958
âª

749
00:33:52,503 --> 00:33:57,774
(woman)
âª she was from kansas âª

750
00:33:57,809 --> 00:34:01,978
âª worked in a dairy âª

751
00:34:02,813 --> 00:34:04,180
Maybe you should, uh,

752
00:34:04,214 --> 00:34:06,048
Leave this
to the bioengineers.

753
00:34:06,083 --> 00:34:08,584
Mm, tried it.
They said it won't work.

754
00:34:08,619 --> 00:34:10,553
Well, maybe that's 'cause
it won't work.

755
00:34:10,587 --> 00:34:13,489
No, they're just not invested
in it like I am.

756
00:34:13,523 --> 00:34:16,125
Hmm.

757
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,494
Holy... It...

758
00:34:18,528 --> 00:34:20,263
It's not liquid.

759
00:34:21,597 --> 00:34:23,932
Arizona, it's not liquid!
Oh, my god.

760
00:34:23,966 --> 00:34:25,157
Oh, god.
Oh, my god.
Do you know what you did?

761
00:34:25,157 --> 00:34:26,290
I, uh, I don't know.
I don't know.

762
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:28,710
I gotta--I gotta--
I gotta do it again.

763
00:34:30,006 --> 00:34:33,275
(laughs) I'm on fire. And it's
not just this. It's...

764
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:36,748
Everyone came to me
for relationship advice today.

765
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:40,855
And I gave them sane
and healthy advice.

766
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:42,617
I mean, whether they take it
or not,

767
00:34:42,652 --> 00:34:44,619
I am seen as someone
sane and healthy enough

768
00:34:44,654 --> 00:34:46,054
To give advice.

769
00:34:46,088 --> 00:34:47,989
I mean, when I lived
in the basement,

770
00:34:48,024 --> 00:34:50,525
When I--when I married
an intern in vegas,

771
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:52,460
I-I wasn't seen that way.
(laughs)

772
00:34:52,495 --> 00:34:54,462
You're amazing.

773
00:34:54,497 --> 00:34:56,811
We're amazing.

774
00:34:56,846 --> 00:34:58,850
(laughs)
I mean,
we're the stable couple now.

775
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,768
We're the one
everyone wants to be.

776
00:35:00,802 --> 00:35:03,671
(laughs)
I mean, I could just see us
ten years from now

777
00:35:03,705 --> 00:35:06,574
In a big old house
with kids running around

778
00:35:06,608 --> 00:35:09,043
And giving sage, sane advice
to mark sloan,

779
00:35:09,077 --> 00:35:10,945
Who will still be single.
(laughs)

780
00:35:10,979 --> 00:35:13,280
(laughs) well, I'm in it
for all but the kids.

781
00:35:13,315 --> 00:35:14,481
What?

782
00:35:14,516 --> 00:35:16,717
<i>Mm. No kids. And by no,
I mean, "yikes."</i>

783
00:35:16,751 --> 00:35:18,152
No to the kids.

784
00:35:18,186 --> 00:35:21,949
(laughs) you're joking, right?
I mean, you're in pediatrics.

785
00:35:22,023 --> 00:35:23,390
Yeah. Exactly.

786
00:35:23,424 --> 00:35:25,325
I mean, this kid noah
comes in today.

787
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:28,428
And he's fine one minute,
then his mom gives him a hug,

788
00:35:28,463 --> 00:35:31,364
And he lands in my o.R.
Nearly dead.
But you saved him.

789
00:35:31,399 --> 00:35:34,201
Yeah, but his parents? They're--
they're--they're a hot mess.

790
00:35:34,235 --> 00:35:37,670
I mean, they'll never
sleep well again. Mnh-mnh.

791
00:35:38,505 --> 00:35:41,039
But the big house?
Mm. I'm in.

792
00:35:41,074 --> 00:35:44,443
Ooh, and can we have dogs
and chickens?

793
00:35:44,477 --> 00:35:47,146
I have this weird thing
for chickens.

794
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:49,181
âª good-bye, good-bye âª

795
00:35:49,215 --> 00:35:52,618
âª and tomorrow's tomorrow âª

796
00:35:52,652 --> 00:35:54,553
(speaks indistinctly)

797
00:35:54,587 --> 00:35:56,455
(keypad beeping)

798
00:35:56,489 --> 00:35:59,525
âª I will call out for you âª

799
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:03,295
âª and tonight, tonight âª

800
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:06,999
âª I will have to say
good-bye, good-bye âª

801
00:36:07,033 --> 00:36:09,268
I'd love
to have dinner sometime,

802
00:36:09,302 --> 00:36:11,828
If--if--if you're
still up for it.

803
00:36:11,863 --> 00:36:12,871
âª tomorrow, tomorrow âª

804
00:36:12,906 --> 00:36:15,440
I'm not taking you
to dinner.

805
00:36:15,475 --> 00:36:18,477
Oh.

806
00:36:19,311 --> 00:36:21,779
I will take you to lunch...

807
00:36:21,814 --> 00:36:25,516
Saturday afternoon,
in broad daylight.

808
00:36:25,551 --> 00:36:27,752
We'll eat at a public place,

809
00:36:27,786 --> 00:36:30,989
Then maybe take a walk
on a crowded street.

810
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:34,024
We'll get to know each other.

811
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:37,894
See if we have an interest
in the same kind of future,

812
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:39,896
Because...

813
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:42,099
I want to build a life...

814
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:44,501
And a family.

815
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,369
And I'm not wasting my time

816
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:49,906
On someone who doesn't share
that interest.

817
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:51,308
âª your smile and laugh âª

818
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:53,777
âª and words like... âª

819
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:55,912
I'll pick you up at noon.

820
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:59,416
âª ...Home âª

821
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,218
Okay, then.

822
00:37:07,492 --> 00:37:09,960
You know, I used to grill.

823
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:12,963
You're out in the air.
You got your slab of beef.

824
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:15,766
It's a very masculine activity.

825
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,735
But you ever try to grill
in seattle?
I haven't.

826
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:21,972
You stand around in the rain
in a raincoat with the hood up.

827
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:24,908
And let me tell you, there is
nothing manly about a hood

828
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:27,344
And a soggy slab of beef.
Uh, okay.
Look, here's the thing--

829
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:29,279
I don't do things
because there's a timeline.

830
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:31,815
I don't do things because
it's the third anything.

831
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:36,199
I may have been out of
the dating game for a while,

832
00:37:36,234 --> 00:37:39,016
But I don't play

833
00:37:39,051 --> 00:37:41,061
By anyone's rules
other than my own.

834
00:37:41,096 --> 00:37:44,106
So whatever expectations

835
00:37:44,141 --> 00:37:46,495
You walked
into this evening with--

836
00:37:46,529 --> 00:37:48,830
Are--are you lecturing me?

837
00:37:48,865 --> 00:37:51,433
No. I--
no, you are. (laughs)

838
00:37:51,467 --> 00:37:52,801
You lecturpeople.

839
00:37:52,835 --> 00:37:54,770
I think because most people
are scared of you,

840
00:37:54,804 --> 00:37:56,605
So nobody's willing
to interrupt you

841
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:58,974
Once you get on a roll,
but, uh, I'm not scared of you.

842
00:37:59,008 --> 00:38:01,476
So the lecture thing
is not gonna work.

843
00:38:01,511 --> 00:38:03,678
We're gonna have to
have a conversation.

844

Don't worry.
Just ask me a question,

00:38:07,617 --> 00:38:10,852

That we're going to
have sex tonight?

851
00:38:19,028 --> 00:38:20,862
Because if that's the case,
I--

852
00:38:20,897 --> 00:38:22,864
Ask the question.
Don't answer the question.

853
00:38:22,899 --> 00:38:24,566
I'll answer the question.

854
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,967

855
00:38:26,802 --> 00:38:30,638
And, uh, no, I'm not assuming
that we'll have sex tonight.

856
00:38:30,672 --> 00:38:32,707
You're a grown woman.

857
00:38:32,741 --> 00:38:35,576
Neither of us, I believe,
is looking for something trashy.

858
00:38:35,611 --> 00:38:39,146
So I kinda thought,
third date was a little early.

859
00:38:39,181 --> 00:38:41,115
What do you think?

860
00:38:41,149 --> 00:38:43,718
Me, too. I...

861
00:38:43,752 --> 00:38:46,988
Can I make a statement
or just questions?

862
00:38:47,022 --> 00:38:48,422
A statement is fine.

863
00:38:48,457 --> 00:38:50,458

I like to think we'll know it

Probably somewhere between
date 8 and date 12, though.
