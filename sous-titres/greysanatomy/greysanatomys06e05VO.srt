00:00:15,211 --> 00:00:17,576
<i>Pretty soon,the intruder duplicates<i>

8
00:00:32,104 --> 00:00:33,808

9
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,660
<i>it's under attack.<i>

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,693
You can't put that in there.

11
00:00:38,776 --> 00:00:39,940
They told us to grab a cubby.

12
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:45,076
Yeah,I know.It's just... we
keep it empty for a reason.

13
00:00:45,341 --> 00:00:46,880
Can you just take your stuff out?

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,300
There are some empty ones
over there you can use.

15
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:50,933
I don't think so.

16
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:55,250
I said take it out.

17
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,919
Great.I got the crazy one next to me.

18
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,819
You want to fight?'Cause I will.

19
00:01:00,902 --> 00:01:02,770
I will fight you you're pretty tiny.

20
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,687
- Come on.Come on.
- I could take you down in just a couple of seconds.

21
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,280
Come on.Stop.

22
00:01:07,363 --> 00:01:08,676
It's an invasion.

23
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:18,540
<i>The question for a doctor is,once the invaders
have landed,once they've taken over  your body...<i>

24
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,075
they took george's cubby.

25
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,139
how the hell  do you get rid of them?

30
00:01:44,033 --> 00:01:49,107
There should be at least a couple of days where they act
like guests before they put their feet up on the coffee table.

31
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,915
And what's with the orange scrubs?

32
00:01:50,998 --> 00:01:53,730
- What,ours aren't good enough for 'em?
- We ran out.

33
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:57,505
They're on back order.Randall from the supply
company says there'll be here in a week.

34
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,489
That's what you learn
when you lie here all day.

35
00:02:00,572 --> 00:02:02,090
Why bother ordering new ones?

36
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:05,560
We could just give these to our replacements.we're
not gonna be replaced by anybody.

37
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:09,780
- If I have to become a coroner...
- No one is becoming a coroner.

38
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,150
Cristina,tell him.

39
00:02:11,233 --> 00:02:12,928
Tell him what?They're here.It's over.

40
00:02:13,011 --> 00:02:16,630
We are not some stupid hosts.

41
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:17,980
They can't invade us.

42
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:21,695
They can't attach themselves to our faces
and then while we're eating spaghetti,

43
00:02:21,778 --> 00:02:24,490
explode out of our chests
and skitter across the floor.

44
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,040
This is our ship.

45
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,147
This is ourship.

46
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,260
excuse me. Are you are you
quoting a sigourney weaver movie?

47
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,870
- Shut up.
- That's what happens when you live here.

48
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,732
You watch a lot of tv.

49
00:02:36,953 --> 00:02:38,407
We own this hospital.

50
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,681
We were born in this hospital.

51
00:02:41,764 --> 00:02:46,218
And we will hold this hospital
with our last gasping breath.

52
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:50,070
I really don't want to be a coroner.

53
00:02:50,153 --> 00:02:51,640
I don't like dead people.

54
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:55,610
Go out there and go get surgeries
before they take them.Go!

55
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,495
And I want a full report
by the end of the day.

56
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,191
And what is wrong with you?

57
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,420
I-I don't know what i'm fighting for.

58
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,573
Surgeries,cristina.Surgeries.

59
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:12,800
There will be a cardio
god here again one day.

60
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,950
And when there is,you don't
want to be out of practice.

61
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,086
Now go.

62
00:03:19,694 --> 00:03:21,390
is this overflow from mercy west?

63
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,230
Their--their E.R. Closed for good
last night.Everyone's coming over here.

64
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,500
Another one of the
perks from the merger.

65
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,620
-Our new attending.
- First day back?

66
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:28,920
- You picked a good one.

67
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,760
It's nice and quiet. Not a lot going on.

68
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,060
Thank you.

69
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,710
Where do you want us?

70
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,490
At this point,anywhere is good.

71
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,339
At mercy west,we do zones.

72
00:03:37,422 --> 00:03:40,030
When it's super busy,we just
give everyone a zone, space.

73
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:43,310
The nurses put a person in that space,you know
it's your pient.Helps you get to 'em quicker.

74
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:46,290
This is the E.R.Not a school
yard.We're not playing four square.

75
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,830
- I like it.
- What?

76
00:03:48,913 --> 00:03:50,270
It's a good idea.Let's
try it.What's your name?

77
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,650
- Jackson avery.
- dr. Avery,dr. Hunt.

78
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,288
It's all yours.Zone away.

79
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:58,518
let's go.

80
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,220
- Chif
- what do you need ?

81
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,320
I know you still have cuts
to make at the resident level,

82
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:09,370
and I just want you to keep in mind
that izzie stevens is not 100% back yet.

83
00:04:09,746 --> 00:04:11,300
I mean,she's recovering.

84
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,964
Look, she just...
she needs this.

85
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,325
I have a hospital to run,karev.

86
00:04:17,968 --> 00:04:19,628
I have two hospitals to run.

87
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,798
That wasn't cool.

88
00:04:26,881 --> 00:04:28,350
- What?
- In the locker room.

89
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,700
My friend should've left
that cubby empty.I'm sorry.

90
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,700
- Well,she's obviously not,so--
it's the first day of school.

91
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:37,430
Everyone's on edge.I'll probably kill
someone before the day is through.

92
00:04:37,513 --> 00:04:39,387
I'm charles,by the way.Charles percy.

93
00:04:40,937 --> 00:04:44,159
it might be kinda hard for
you not to talk to me all day.

94
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,850
It can be done.

95
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:49,190
I almost didn't talk to my family for
a car ride across the whole country--

96
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:53,030
10 days,15 states,not a peep.

97
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,385
Just read books,pretended
I was a hostage.

98
00:04:55,468 --> 00:04:56,589
Izzie stevens.

99
00:04:56,865 --> 00:04:59,100
Nice to meet you, Izzie stevens.

100
00:04:59,183 --> 00:05:02,938
Do you happen to know the
key code to the research library?

101
00:05:03,021 --> 00:05:04,502
I was here last night,and it was closed.

102
00:05:04,585 --> 00:05:06,487
It took me two years to get that code.

103
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,059
I need every advantage I can get.

104
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,910
Did the gentleman from the
waiting room ever find you?

105
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:17,820
What?

106
00:05:18,095 --> 00:05:21,460
It's the gentleman who could
possibly be your father.

107
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:22,654
What?

108
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,945
daddy.

109
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,724
Calliope.

110
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,459
What... what are you doing here?

111
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,406
I came to see you.

112
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,028
Why?

113
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,330
Calliope,we used to talk.Every
sunday,we used to talk.

114
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:49,504
I'd wait for your call,and you'd tell me
everything,all about your crazy adventures.

115
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:58,742
even when you were in trouble,you'd
still call,and we worked it out.

116
00:05:59,252 --> 00:06:01,117
We'd always work it out,mija. Hmm?

117
00:06:04,325 --> 00:06:05,133
daddy.

118
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:11,269
- I'm sorry. I' m... I'm sorry things got so... 
- Sure.

119
00:06:12,341 --> 00:06:14,001
But the fact that you came...

120
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,987
daddy,is that father kevin?

121
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,297
Hello,calliope.

122
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,030
Wh--are you t--
two here to...

123
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,520
you think you can pray away the gay.

124
00:06:32,603 --> 00:06:33,724
We can just sit and talk.

125
00:06:33,807 --> 00:06:36,180
Oh,no.You can't pray away the gay.

126
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,884
Calliope iphegenia torres!

127
00:06:37,967 --> 00:06:40,156
You can't pray away the gay!

128
00:06:47,167 --> 00:06:51,110
The man flew 3,000 miles to make
me straight... with a priest.

129
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,630
I'm lucky they didn't
march into the E.R.

130
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:55,748
- Swinging incense,all--all hepped up for an exorcism.- 
- Are you done yet?

131
00:06:56,551 --> 00:06:57,207
no!

132
00:06:57,638 --> 00:07:00,680
He came here to disinfect you from
my life.You n't find that abhorrent?

133
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,220
- I do,but 
- There is no "but," 

134
00:07:02,718 --> 00:07:05,419
What,you're gonna you're gonna
tell me you get where he's coming from?

135
00:07:05,502 --> 00:07:07,465
Maybe you should try and talk to him.

136
00:07:07,548 --> 00:07:08,850
I have nothing to say.

137
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:11,970
If he wants to throw away our relationship
after 30 years,then that's his decision.

138
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,440
He hasn't done anything here.

139
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,660
You're the one who changed the game.

140
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:20,890
You didn't expect a little understanding
when you came out to your parents?

141
00:07:22,944 --> 00:07:25,456
I never had boyfriends... ever.

142
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:28,984
I had a poster on my wall of cindy
crawford,and I wasn't just looking at her mole.

143
00:07:29,067 --> 00:07:33,202
It wasn't news to my mom when I
brought somebody home named joanne.

144
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:38,865
But you,you dated men your whole
life.You loved men.You even married one.

145
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,297
you want to talk about 30
years of a relationship?

146
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:44,251
You know,he's been
consistent for 30 years.

147
00:07:44,489 --> 00:07:47,330
And all of a sudden,you're
a whole new girl.

148
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:49,689
Cut him some slack.

149
00:07:49,772 --> 00:07:52,320
Sit down and have a conversation.

150
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:55,156
Give him room to be a little shocked.

151
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:00,041
I hate you.

152
00:08:00,124 --> 00:08:02,508
'Cause I'm right and I'm awesome.

153
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,820
thanks for being my tour guide
through all this first-day madness.

154
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:11,050
- We both got assigned zone five,so...
- I know it's not like you had any choice.

155
00:08:11,133 --> 00:08:13,020
Still,you're a peach
to pretend otherwise.

156
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:15,470
- Being the new kid is...
- A little scary,I know.

157
00:08:15,553 --> 00:08:20,430
Of course,you were here when that psycho-intern cabal
was marching around chopping out each other's organs.

158
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,099
now that must have been scary.

159
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,300
I'm dr. Kepner. Oh handcuff !

160
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,740
I'm not an ax murderer.

161
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,970
I just broke in to someone's house.

162
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,730
Dude came after me with a golf
club,beat the crap out of me.

163
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:36,100
Look,you don't need the
cop.I can barely move.

164
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,410
- Roll him.
- Oh,we'll keep the cop.

165
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,230
he's got multiple contusions
and ecchymosis over his back.

166
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,910
He's gonna need lumbar
and thoracic films.

167
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:46,638
Down.

168
00:08:47,358 --> 00:08:51,490
And by the way,it was one organ--an
appendix.It wasn't a psycho cabal.

169
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,131
Good to know.

170
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,934
hey,sarah.

171
00:08:58,549 --> 00:09:02,210
dr. Stevens.  I have to go.The doctors are here.

172
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:06,220
My sister and her daughters want you
all to promise them it's a good kidney.

173
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,898
it's a good kidney.

174
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,510
There,all right?bye.

175
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,870
Uh,sarah fremont,age
27.End-stage renal disease.

176
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:18,360
On dialysis for three
years,waiting for a kidney.

177
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,088
She's down to her last access site.

178
00:09:20,171 --> 00:09:23,530
That's the polite way of saying they've
run out of places to stick the needles.

179
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:26,970
Ms.Fremont has a subclavian
catheter for access.

180
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,820
Why is this not ideal?

181
00:09:28,903 --> 00:09:35,920
It's difficult to obtain sufficient blood
flow through... You guys raise hands.

182
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,690
Frank Nusbaum,42,multiple,mostly
superficial stab wounds.

183
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,112
Vital signs stable.

184
00:09:42,195 --> 00:09:43,463
His buddy's got a lacerated palm.

185
00:09:43,546 --> 00:09:44,830
- Got it.Thanks,ray.
- I'm not his buddy!

186
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,840
He touched my little girl,my baby!

187
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,150
She's not a baby.

188
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,390
She's 19 years old.

189
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,070
There ain't a scrap
of baby left there,don.

190
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,320
On three.One,two,three.

191
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,100
We got a bleeder here.

192
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,459
Draw me up some lidocaine
and,uh,get me a lac tray with 3-0 silk.

193
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,437
- Need any help?
- Sir,this is gonna pinch.

194
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,220
He came at me with a carving knife.

195
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,660
- He tried to cut off my--
- Come on.I was gesturing!

196
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,470
You ran into the knife.

197
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,410
- You're an idiot and a pervert.
- Tie.

198
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,910
She used to babysit your brats.

199
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,410
I can't believe I ever
let her in your house!

200
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,870
I love her,don.

201
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,850
I love her,and she loves me.

202
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:16,800
I'm gonna kill him.

203
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,140
Easy,all right?

204
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,308
Let him die.Just let him die.

205
00:10:19,391 --> 00:10:20,360
It's what he deserves.

206
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,280
Can you shut him up?

207
00:10:21,363 --> 00:10:22,720
- Are you sure there's nothing I can do ?
- there.

208
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,960
You know what?That's how we
do it on our side of town.

209
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,700
Nice try.This is my
zone.He's my patient.

210
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,520
Yet I'm the one actually helping him.

211
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,230
How long have you been
having stomach pains?

212
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,810
A few days now.

213
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:36,550
They keep getting worse.

214
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,350
- My dad a fell a couple of months ago,had a stable hip fracture 
- Excuse me.

215
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,590
- This is my patient.
- Not anymore.

216
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:45,460
Fine.Good luck doing
an h&p without a chart.

217
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:47,250
I'll just add this to the chart later.

218
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,720
If you can find it.

219
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,101
This is the nurses' lounge.

220
00:10:50,184 --> 00:10:54,610
It is literally always  someone's birthday,so
if you're nice to the nurses,you will get cake.

221
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:55,635
The lab.

222
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,890
How's the I.L.-2 going,dr. S.,Good?

223
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,638
Good.

224
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,560
I.L.-2,huh?

225
00:11:03,113 --> 00:11:05,390
- Are you feeling
- Stable for now.

226
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:12,530
And you don't want anyone to know because they'll be
blown away by the fact that you're already back at work

227
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:17,650
and they'll only be able to think of you as some
sort of awesome super woman,which clearly,you are.

228
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,784
You know what?

229
00:11:18,867 --> 00:11:19,970
The fake flattery?

230
00:11:20,053 --> 00:11:21,322
It's kinda gross.

231
00:11:22,443 --> 00:11:24,660
You want tknow something
deeply personal about me?

232
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,959
You see that girl?Her name's reed.

233
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:34,710
I have the biggest crush in the world on
her,and she doesn't even know I'm alive.

234
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,675
She calls me charlie.

235
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:43,770
Nobody named charlie ever got the
girl, charlie brown,charlie manson.

236
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:48,540
I'm not trying to minimize your cancer
or anything,but this really sucks for me.

237
00:11:49,797 --> 00:11:50,913
You like her?

238
00:11:51,329 --> 00:11:52,460
I love her.

239
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,008
43-81.

240
00:11:58,324 --> 00:11:59,375
What's that?

241
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:02,160
The code to the research library.

242
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:09,660
"While performance has been evaluated,the
largest considerations have been budgetary.

243
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:15,470
" This is the speech we want you to use when you're
firing staff-- these exact words.Don't deviate.

244
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:19,810
I'm not using your speech to fire
people,and I don't need an H.R.Chaperone.

245
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,590
Thank you for your time.

246
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,600
Chief,are you familiar
with Megan Nowlan?

247
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:26,775
Mm,yes,yeah.

248
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,510
Uh,e was an intern.

249
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,658
She was married to steve mostow.

250
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:33,960
I fired her.I know how to fire people.

251
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,670
I don't like it,but I know
how to do it,and I do it well.

252
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:41,810
You used an e-mail to fire her,and now she's
suing the hospital for wrongful termination,

253
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,292
claims she was fired
because she was prnant.

254
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,300
This is the speech.

255
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,885
Don't deviate.

256
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:54,630
T&l spine films showed
a burst fracture at t-12.

257
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:58,587
And here you can see evidence of instability
because the veebral height loss is greater than 50%,

258
00:12:58,499 --> 00:13:02,050
which implies both A.L.L.
And P.L.L.Are disrupted.

259
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,230
What's that mean?

260
00:13:03,313 --> 00:13:04,577
I got a broken back?

261
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:06,760
I'll still be able to walk,right?

262
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:11,460
You will still be able to
walk,burgle,have a full life.Ideas?

263
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,830
Decompression via corpectomy and reconstruction
with strut graft and anterior instrumentation.

264
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,980
I might be out of my league here.

265
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,330
She has a photographic memory.

266
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,250
We're all out of that league.

267
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:24,060
And here I was thinking you could do
transpedicle screws with a posterior approach.

268
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:30,631
Seemed like a good
idea,but,you know,maybe not.

269
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,312
Let's go with the pedicle screws.

270
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,180
Get him into pre-op,and let me
know when his test results come back.

271
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,126
I'm on it.

272
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,267
Frank.Oh,my god.

273
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,960
Honey,are you okay?

274
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,750
I'll be fine,sweetheart.

275
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,510
Get off of her,you perv!

276
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,329
Daddy.

277
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,370
I will kill you,you son of a bitch!

278
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:55,000
Security! stop!

279
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,230
nice work. Thanks.

280
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:03,540
I got it from here.

281
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,660
Tackle like that,you
had to play football.

282
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,880
I played a little in college.

283
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:21,030
- Safety?
- And wide receiver,yeah.

284
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,200
Offense and defense.Impressive.

285
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,040
Can you bring that guy over later?

286
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,720
I want to thank him.

287
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,615
He saved my life.

288
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,650
No,I saved your life.

289
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,127
I'm still saving it.

290
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:40,820
- You paged?
- Yes.I ran a C.T. On your guy with the tummy ache.

291
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,840
Turns out he has an adrenal mass.

292
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:45,000
Thought you might want to see the scans.

293
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,890
I was waiting until I got the
lab results to order a C.T.

294
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,350
You stole my lab results?

295
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,100
And look,now I get a
surgery for all my trouble.

296
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:57,570
excuse me,dr. Karev,my dad
and I have some more questions.

297
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,920
He's still pretty upset.

298
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,980
Yeah,I'll be there in a minute.Thanks.

299
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,030
I'll take those.

300
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,620
You gonna fight back at some
point or just let her bury you?

301
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,650
She's not burying me.

302
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,408
She's new.She's just
finding her footing.

303
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,840
She found her footing
on the back of your neck.

304
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:26,344
What do you care?

305
00:15:26,596 --> 00:15:27,610
I don't know.

306
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:28,969
I like you.

307
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,200
No,I like that. stop. That's good.

308
00:15:34,283 --> 00:15:36,000
Find her open window.

309
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,843
Everyone has one--
a we spot,undefended.

310
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:45,660
An open window or a key hidden
in a fake rock,that's how I do it.

311
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:48,140
Yeah,well,you're a criminal,and I'm not.

312
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:51,470
It's not a crime to do to
her what she's doing to you.

313
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,945
Which is what,exactly?

314
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,752
Making you look like an idiot.

315
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,260
- Have you talked to any of them?
- Who?

316
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,916
The mercy westers.

317
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,620
- Yeah.
- And?

318
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,580
And... I love you.

319
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:08,590
No,not that.

320
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,040
I need to know what's
going on out there.

321
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,610
I need to knowhow cristina's doing.

322
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,730
She was cardio deprived and depressed.

323
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,916
Are you and cristina in
a dark and twisty place?

324
00:16:16,501 --> 00:16:18,600
Are you having the dark and twisties?

325
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:19,981
We are.

326
00:16:20,064 --> 00:16:21,530
Both of you are dark and twisty?

327
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,620
I told you,we are.

328
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:27,320
Excuse me dr. Hunt, you paged me?

329
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,300
Your patient was having neurologic
symptoms and you didn't notice,karev?

330
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:35,180
Lucky for you dr. Adamson did
and correctly diagnosed carotid stenosis.

331
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,700
Book an O.R. For the afternoon.

332
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,210
What about the surgeryfor
his adrenal tumor?

333
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,680
Your dad has a 90% blockage
in his right carotid artery.

334
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,120
We need to operate on that first.

335
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:48,740
Now I know that's a lot to digest,but dr.
Adamson here will keep you informed,all right?

336
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,750
With all due respect,dr.
Hunt,mr.Goldman is my patient.

337
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:57,120
- I found the tumor 
- And when I operate on the tumor,you can scrub in on that.

338
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:00,604
In the meantime,I want you to help
dr. Adamson  the patient for the C.E.A.

339
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:03,145
- Sir...
- Whatever she needs,karev.

340
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,620
Neurologic symptoms?

341
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,290
You didn't put that in the chart.

342
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:10,290
Oh,I didn't?

343
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,704
all right,fine. I get it.

344
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,207
I sprang this on you.It
was a lot to take in.And...

345
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,880
you feel like you don't have
much experience with gay people,

346
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:28,990
even though uncle berto hasn't been
single for 60 years for no reason.

347
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:31,068
- Calliope 
- It's still an adjustment.

348
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:36,714
That said... you
should've adjusted by now.

349
00:17:37,574 --> 00:17:39,950
I mean,you're supposed
to love me no matter what.

350
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,900
That's... what a parent does.

351
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,687
I love you with all my heart.

352
00:17:45,924 --> 00:17:50,610
But with all that's going on with
you now,it'S... look,m scared for you.

353
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,380
It's an abomination.

354
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,800
It's an eternity in hell.

355
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,650
Let's not start with words like "hell.

356
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:58,596
" Oh,that's why you flew 3,000
miles,to tell mewas going to hell?

357
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,897
I thought you came here to apologize.

358
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,090
I can't apologize,calliope.

359
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,360
I don't understand what
happened or where I went wrong.

360
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,740
Where you went wrong?

361
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,730
Okay,leviticus.

362
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,450
"Thought shalt not lie with a
man as one lies with a female.

363
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:12,560
" Oh,don't do that,daddy.

364
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:14,610
- Don't quote the bible at me.
- "It is an abomination.

365
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,550
" "The outcry of sodom
and gomorrah is great,

366
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:18,550
and their sin is exceedingly grave.

367
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,447
- Carlos,this is not what we
- Jesus"

368
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:23,430
a new commandment that I give
unto you that you love one another.

369
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:25,170
- Romans,"but we know that the law 
- Jesus--"

370
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,960
he who is without sin among
you,let him cast the first stone.

371
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:28,820
" So you admit it's a sin?

372
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,970
"Blessed are the merciful for
they shall obtain mercy"--jesus.

373
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:35,330
"Blessed are the pure in heart,for
they shall see god"--jesus.

374
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:40,630
"Blessed are those who have been persecuted "for
righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

375
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,750
" Jesus is my savior,daddy,not you.

376
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,970
And jesus would be ashamed
of you for judging me!

377
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,400
he would be ashamed of you
for turning your back on me.

378
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,695
He would be ashamed.

379
00:19:01,727 --> 00:19:06,740
with this kind of injury,there is a chance that
you could end up with severe weakness in your legs.

380
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,205
That's okay.

381
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:11,130
I carry the stuff out
with my arms,not my legs.

382
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,910
This is serious,billy.

383
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,694
You're gonna fix me up fine.

384
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:19,510
Listen... I've got a present for you.

385
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,260
You stole her notebook?

386
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,750
Keep it down.You want
my cop all over this?

387
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:24,863
Don't you get it?

388
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,340
This is her open window.

389
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,180
I don't--I don't
want her open window.

390
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,060
"You're not just a good doctor.

391
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:33,300
You're a great doctor.

392
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:36,700
" "You are the future of medicine.

393
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,601
"  "only you can keep you down.

394
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:47,130
" And my favorite is,uh... "no
one can tell it's plastic surgery.

395
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,448
" Oh,my god.

396
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:51,700
I think it's the nose,but it could
be the boobs.What do you think?

397
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,720
Give it back to
her,and stop reading it.

398
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,450
"Future of medicine" alert.

399
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,800
You haven't seen my
notebook anywhere,have you?

400
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,200
Small,red, I was
holding it all morning.

401
00:20:02,052 --> 00:20:03,250
I'm not sure.

402
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:05,800
So much for that
photographic memory.

403
00:20:07,099 --> 00:20:08,465
Good luck finding it.

404
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:12,515
this blows.

405
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,060
getting your ass kicked?

406
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,330
Shut up.I hear yours got a
standing ovation in the E.R.

407
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,400
Yours is the one who saved the whole
E.R.From the maniac with the hammer?

408
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,030
He didn't save anyone.

409
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:25,680
He did some stupid ninja
leap and then tripped a guy.

410
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:28,900
I used actual medicine to
stop a person from dying.

411
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,270
Well,mine has a notebook,a
notebook that she takes notes in,

412
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,280
notes of a very personal
nature,and I stole it.

413
00:20:34,554 --> 00:20:36,346
- You what?
- Give it.

414
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:39,760
No, I am not
sinking to their level.

415
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:43,930
They are vindictive and they are aggressive
and--and they are not  team players.

416
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:48,200
and if we are not careful,that spirit
is going to infect our hospital.

417
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,660
We have to fight it.

418
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,330
Which is why you stole her notebook?

419
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,360
and read it?

420
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,300
She's not a very nice person.

421
00:20:55,578 --> 00:20:56,208
Score.

422
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:57,130
You rock.

423
00:20:57,213 --> 00:20:59,258
- Oh no.That's not for you.
- Who's it for then?

424
00:20:59,464 --> 00:21:00,419
Charles.

425
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,430
Your mercy wester?!

426
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,630
They're handing us our asses on a
plate,and you're serving 'em coffee?

427
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,290
Charles is actually kind of awesome.

428
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,920
And if you all could get past your
sad,little egos,you would realize,

429
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:14,340
you can't write off  all of the mercy west
residents just 'cause you feel threatened.

430
00:21:14,914 --> 00:21:17,205
- we don't feel threatened.
- No.

431
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:20,347
We feel pretty threatened.

432
00:21:27,543 --> 00:21:29,170
they're not here.

433
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,205
Hallelujah.

434
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:31,980
They're not eating.

435
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,166
They're working.

436
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,770
- Oh,my god.They don't eat lunch.
- Oh,god!

437
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:41,980
What's going on?

438
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:45,170
Pulsatile mass over the stab
wound.What are we looking at,dr. Avery?

439
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:47,620
Can't be sure without an angio,but
I think it's a pseudoaneurysm.

440
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,180
I think you're
right.Keep pressure on it.

441
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,750
Let's gehim up to angio,and if
it's positive,you're scrubbing in.

442
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,970
- Thank you,sir.
- But that's my patient.

443
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,408
He was here,and you weren'T.

444
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:59,270
- dr. Hunt!
- What?

445
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,200
Cristina,what?

446
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,830
What?You know what?That doesn't matter
that that's my patient or my surgery?

447
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:12,400
You're prioritizing based on some sort of random
code,some stupid rule you have not to favor me?

448
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,973
This--this is
one surgery.

449
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:17,649
forget it.

450
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,850
the woman does whatever I ask.

451
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,110
I want something...  she gets it for me.

452
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,220
The research library?

453
00:22:28,303 --> 00:22:30,990
Anytime you want to go in,it's
closed,just say the word.

454
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,520
She gave me the code to the place.

455
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,520
- You're kidding.
- She can't do enough for me.

456
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,453
it's like I have my own surgical bitch.

457
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,283
didn't go well,huh?

458
00:23:09,975 --> 00:23:12,400
well,at least now I can
move on with my life.

459
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:16,490
Stop entertaining any thoughts of actually
getting back together with my family.

460
00:23:18,045 --> 00:23:19,955
whatever.I don't need a father.

461
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:25,940
I don'T... not one who won't accept me.

462
00:23:29,622 --> 00:23:30,518
I know.

463
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:42,435
well,his vital signs are fine.

464
00:23:42,518 --> 00:23:44,340
B.P. Looks good.

465
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,283
I hurt.

466
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:50,030
- The neck... blood...
- what?

467
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:54,780
In head... ple... 12.

468
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,798
- What's happening here?
- I'm not sure.

469
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,730
We're gonna have
to,uh,hold off on the O.R.

470
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:02,890
pathetic.

471
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,950
Look,he just said a
bunch of weird crap,okay?

472
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:08,420
He has expressive aphasia,which means broca's
area,which is the left side of the brain.

473
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:10,350
You said it was the right
side that was blocked.

474
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:11,670
5% of people have broca's on the right.

475
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,030
You want to take that chance?

476
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,480
What if it's a brain met from the tumor?

477
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:16,780
Oh,right.Because you diagnosed
a tumor,now it's a met.

478
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,580
I've seen this before.Have you?

479
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:23,990
Stop. Your behavior has been disgusting.

480
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,760
I mean,all you've done all day is take
pleasure in how the other one got it wrong,

481
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,375
how they screwed it up.

482
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:33,841
This is my father...  my father.

483
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:38,708
And... and you are
supposed to be healers.

484
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:43,299
That's what you're job's
supposed to be,to heal people.

485
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,550
We're gonna run some more tests,ma'am.

486
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,864
We're... very sorry.

487
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,293
thank you.

488
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,640
- dr. Stevens,can i talk to you for a minute?
- Go away.

489
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:03,170
Picked up the labs for you.If you
want,I can take care of the dialysis.

490
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,820
I've got this.

491
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,530
I don't need a surgical bitch. Thanks.

492
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,945
Izzie,it wasn't personal.

493
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:13,280
That stuff,it just...
comes with the job.

494
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:15,440
I'd expect you to do
the same thing to me.

495
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:17,040
Outside of work,you can be friends.

496
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:19,710
But inside,it's a whole different story.

497
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,760
At least it wasat mercy west.

498
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,313
That isn't how it is here.

499
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,000
Here,we don't just
think about ourselves.

500
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:26,510
We support one another.We
have each other's backs.

501
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:30,825
We throw ourselves in front of buses
to save the lives of complete strangers.

502
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,918
You will never measure up
to the people we've lost.

503
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:46,830
Let's do a 140-base sodium,37-base biocarb and a
zero-k bath with an ultrafiltration of 3.5 liters.

504
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:53,520
"That,I suppose,makes
everything quite all right."

505
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,002
"Oh, this?"

506
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:05,570
Cristina.
Cristina, talk to me.

507
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,779
- No.
- cristina.

508
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:13,521
- He wouldn'T...
- What happened?

509
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:22,905
here.

510
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,400
talk to me.Tell me what happened.

511
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,518
Nothing.

512
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,592
Nothing is happening to me.

513
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,170
You know,I don't I
don't know what I'm doing.

514
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:40,550
I'm,like,chasing after
surgeries I don't care about.

515
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:50,237
Do you know how long it's been
since I've hela heart iny hand...

516
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:56,427
since I felt that... that joy,that rush?

517
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:03,740
you know... I miss burke.

518
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,700
I-I m--I miss
him all day.

519
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:11,800
I miss--you know,I-I-- it's--it's
not the relationship or--or the sex.

520
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:12,847
I miss...

521
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:20,096
every day when he was
here,I held hearts.

522
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:26,800
And I got picked,not because of some favoritism,but
because it was just,like,it was right.

523
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:29,676
And I learned.I learned.

524
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:40,718
and I felt seen.

525
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:44,770
And now you know what?I don't know what.

526
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:48,310
I spent this entire day fighting...

527
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:54,203
and I-I don't want to do it anymore.

528
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:00,544
Come over here.

529
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:31,470
Where are we at with billy sheehan?

530
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:34,100
He's ready.I helped put him
under.He's prepped and positioned.


531
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,750
I thought we said I was handling that.

532
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,710
Yeah,we did.I just wanted to make absolutely
sure everything was ready for dr. Shepherd.

533
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:41,030
Well,your first day here,and
already you're making my life easier.

534
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:43,360
Yeah,dr. Kepner--no,she's
not just a good doctor.

535
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,300
She's--she's
a great doctor.

536
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,510
In fact,if you ask me,she's
the future of medicine.

537
00:28:47,593 --> 00:28:49,667
Only you can keep yourself down,right?

538
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:53,773
By the way,I can tell.

539
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,858
d-dr. Shepherd,I just need a moment.

540
00:29:07,331 --> 00:29:08,370
Look at this.

541
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:10,177
Acute on chronic subdural hematoma.

542
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,565
That's not mets.

543
00:29:11,648 --> 00:29:12,960
No,it's a brain bleed.

544
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,250
Which would explain the
aphasia and the numbness.

545
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,750
It would explain everything.

546
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:17,524
I'll tell neuro.

547
00:29:17,607 --> 00:29:20,060
Oh,no.Nice try.I'll tell neuro.

548
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:21,840
I'm the one that said
it was a brain issue.

549
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:26,240
The only reason why you knew that was because I got
e ball rolling by diagnosing the carotid stenosis.

550
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:29,430
Can't you give it a rest?Didn't you
hear what goldman's daughter said?

551
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:31,648
Sorry.

552
00:29:32,846 --> 00:29:34,256
I'll stop if you stop.

553
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,692
I've stopped.You can have it.

554
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:39,602
Talk to arizona robbins--
she's head of neuro.

555
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,880
She's not really head of neuro,is she?

556
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,440
what the hell happened?!

557
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,790
Push another 2 of ativan now.

558
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:54,370
Get me new chemistries and an E.K.G.

559
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,790
Get the crash cart in here now.

560
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:57,040
Start ventilating her.

561
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:59,370
Torsades?You gave her torsades?

562
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,610
What the hell did you do to her?

563
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,710
I didn't do anything.You were
the one who was with her last.

564
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:04,780
- Page bailey.
- I already did.

565
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,720
clear.Clear!

566
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:24,631
I don't know you well
enough to talk about her.

567
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,119
We're not gonna do that.

568
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:35,700
Most people think that I was named
for the state,but it's not true.

569
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:39,630
I was named for a
battleship--the "U.S.S. Arizona."

570
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:45,940
My grandfather was serving on the arizona
when the japanese bombed pearl harbor,

571
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:50,068
and he saved... 19
men before he drowned.

572
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:58,432
Pretty much everything my father did his
whole life was about honoring that sacrifice.

573
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:04,693
I was raised to be a good man in
a storm,raised to love my country,

574
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,342
love my family and
protect the things I love.

575
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:14,867
When my father... colonel daniel robbins
of the united states marine corps,

576
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:19,930
heard that I was a lesbian,he
said he only had one question.

577
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:25,505
I was prepared for "how fast can
you get the hell out of my house?

578
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:32,456
" But instead... it was... "

579
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:37,005
are you still who I raised you to be?

580
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:43,617
" My father believes in country
the way that you believe in god.

581
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:50,199
And my father is not a man who bends,but
he bent for me because I'm his daughter.

582
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:55,519
I'm a good man in a storm.

583
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:05,190
I love your daughter,and I
protect the things I love.

584
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,001
Not that I need to.She doesn't need it.

585
00:32:10,281 --> 00:32:14,374
She's strong and
caring... and honorable.

586
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:19,701
and she's who you raised her to be.

587
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,890
She's alive,barely.

588
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,140
Is she still gonna get the kidney?

589
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,080
I'm asking the questions
right now,stevens.

590
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:47,830
dr. Percy here tells me that you
were in charge of sarah's dialysis.

591
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:49,790
- Is that true?
- Yes.

592
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:53,241
He also says that you
were pretty upset with him.

593
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,640
I don't see what that
has to do with anything.

594
00:32:55,710 --> 00:33:00,280
It has to do with the fact that your
mental state may have clouded your judgment,

595
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:03,460
may have made you a
less competent doctor,

596
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:08,780
may have led you to read the labs
wrong or not read them at all.

597
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:14,760
Otherwise,why would you tell the
tech to give sarah a zero-k bath

598
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:18,874
when her potassium this morning was 3.4?

599
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:25,150
You sucked all the
potassium out of that woman.

600
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:26,977
You stopped her heart.

601
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:31,090
She's alive,but she's
not getting her kidney.

602
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:36,214
After three years of waiting,somebody
else  will be getting her kidney.

603
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:42,559
And if we don't find her another one in
the next three days,she's going to be dead,

604
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:45,137
and you will have killed her.

605
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,760
The surgery went
pretty well.

606
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:02,240
We had good bone alignment.

607
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,865
And I'll be back to my old self?

608
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,980
I'll be able to get around?

609
00:34:06,535 --> 00:34:08,080
Get around?Yes.

610
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:10,960
To where you were?
No,probably not.

611
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:15,100
Probably about 70%,which is
good considering your injuries.

612
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:23,268
I guess that means I only
steal 70% as much stuff.

613
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,274
you see this?

614
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:40,310
I noticed this afternoon there were splotches
all over the page,and... they're tears.

615
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:42,940
She was crying when
she wrote this stuff.

616
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,052
She's scared.

617
00:34:46,378 --> 00:34:50,003
And these stupid little
sayings,they make her feel better.

618
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,560
This is her comfort.

619
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:55,557
We stole her comfort from her.

620
00:34:56,730 --> 00:35:00,928
You and me,we're-- we're taking things
from people,and we're leaving them at 70%.

621
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,570
you promised.

622
00:35:12,674 --> 00:35:16,008
You promised my nieces I
was getting this kidney.

623
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:21,170
I'm sorry.I am... so,so sorry.

624
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,740
But I am going to make this right.

625
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:24,828
I'm going to get you another kidney.

626
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,192
it's my sister.

627
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,444
What do I tell her?

628
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:02,860
I'm sorry.

629
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:08,384
it must be hard,being the
new people,being the invaders.

630
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,926
But that's no excuse for you being A...

631
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,030
I don't like you.

632
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:22,131
but what I did...
that was over the line.

633
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,478
Oh,I'm sorry.I thought
you wanted to see me.

634
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:40,890
This is Missy Grant
from human resources.

635
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,503
You're kidding me.

636
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,230
You're firing me?

637
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,620
- Stevens
- You can't do that.

638
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:52,849
You can't fire me
for-- for having cancer.

639
00:36:52,932 --> 00:36:54,930
I'm pretty sure that that's
five kinds of illegal.

640
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,515
This is not about the cancer.

641
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:01,697
It's about the kidney patient?

642
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:06,010
I made a mistake.I...

643
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:09,690
but doctors make mistakes
in this hospital every day.

644
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:13,280
- Yes,but when there's
- You let me come back after I cut an l-vad wire.

645
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,747
That was a different era.

646
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,451
Times have changed.

647
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:23,520
dr. Shepherd and dr. Hunt... had concerns
about your stamina and emotional stability.

648
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,820
- And dr. Karev has questions about
- Alex?

649
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:29,250
Alex said something to you?

650
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,327
dr. Webber.

651
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:43,980
In the wake of the merger with mercy
west,the needs of the hospital have changed.

652
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:51,920
While performance is evaluated... the
largest considerations are budgetary.

653
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,420
There was simply no room on the staff.

654
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,090
please don't do this to me.

655
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:17,760
please don't take this away from me.

656
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:19,769
I don't have anything left.

657
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,715
please.

658
00:38:23,181 --> 00:38:25,545
<i>What do you do  when
the infection hits you...<i>

659
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:27,397
calliope?

660
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,180
<i>When it takes over?<i>

661
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,290
I can't do this anymore.You'll,you
know,see me in hell.

662
00:38:32,373 --> 00:38:34,391
Listen to me,please.

663
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,827
I have to catch you.

664
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:39,689
What?

665
00:38:39,973 --> 00:38:47,360
Your whole life,you... you've always been on a
bridge,calliope,ever since you were a little girl.

666
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,170
And you don't just walk on it either.

667
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:53,100
No,you climb on the railing and
you're-- you're ready to leap.

668
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:57,094
And when you do,when that happens...

669
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,948
I have to be there,I have to catch you.

670
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,990
You don't have to catch me,dad.

671
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:06,007
Yes,I do.

672
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:09,364
It's my job.

673
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:22,920
if this works out between you
and arizona... is there a chance

674
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:27,068
that maybe you'd,uh...
give your mother a wedding?

675
00:39:29,463 --> 00:39:32,063
I think if arizona wanted
to spend the rest of her life with me?

676
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:37,505
Yeah,I'll put on a big white
dress and dance down the aisle.

677
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:40,904
How-- how
about grandkids?

678
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,695
Yes,I would imagine...

679
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:49,320
When the time came...
there would be kids.

680
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,280
Does she make you happy?

681
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:56,372
Yes,dad.

682
00:39:57,224 --> 00:39:58,884
she makes me very happy.

683
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,241
I love you.You know that?

684
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:09,265
she's not a vegetarian,is she?

685
00:40:09,547 --> 00:40:11,330
Because I-I don't know
how much more I can take.

686
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:13,503
She's not a vegetarian.

687
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,247
I feel very old.

688
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:24,120
<i>Do you do  what you're supposed
to  and take your medicine?<i>

689
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:27,500
<i>Or do you learn to
live  with the thing ?<i>

690
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:30,760
<i>and hope someday  it goes away?<i>

691
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:05,735
tell me everything.

692
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,340
Did you beat them?

693
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:08,715
Did you kick their asses?

694
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,568
Come on.I want a full
report.Everything that happened.

695
00:41:16,287 --> 00:41:17,766
Izzie left me.

696
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,990
She wrote a note and she left me.

697
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:27,322
I don't--I don't-- I don't
know if she's coming back.

698
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:31,430
Wh-what do you mean,she
left?Where did she go?

699
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:44,120
- Go hug him.
- What?

700
00:41:44,203 --> 00:41:45,339
Go hug him.

701
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:51,270
