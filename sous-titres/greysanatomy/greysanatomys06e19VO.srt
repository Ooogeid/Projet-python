1
00:00:05,794 --> 00:00:09,267
Psychologists believe that every aspect of our lives,

2
00:00:09,268 --> 00:00:11,976
all thoughts and behavior patterns

3
00:00:11,977 --> 00:00:15,465
are the direct result of our relationship to our parents.

4
00:00:15,466 --> 00:00:17,588
Well, you're looking all thoughtful.

5
00:00:19,134 --> 00:00:21,927
I was just thinking how pretty you are...

6
00:00:22,574 --> 00:00:25,648
and also how pretty our children would be.

7
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:27,592
Children?

8
00:00:27,593 --> 00:00:29,549
Like, multiple?

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,090
Child.

10
00:00:31,091 --> 00:00:33,049
Let's just start with one and see how that goes.

11
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,698
You wanna start?

12
00:00:34,699 --> 00:00:37,940
I'm just saying, you're pretty.

13
00:00:37,941 --> 00:00:39,621
That's all I'm saying.

14
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:42,970
That every relationship we have is really just another version

15
00:00:42,971 --> 00:00:45,304
of that first relationship.

16
00:00:45,305 --> 00:00:48,105
Have you talked to Dr. Wyatt?

17
00:00:48,106 --> 00:00:49,828
Christina ...

18
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:51,965
when's the last time you...

19
00:00:53,689 --> 00:00:58,308
it's just us trying over and over again to get it right.

20
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:00,942
- Alex.
- Mer?

21
00:01:00,943 --> 00:01:03,604
Okay, so izzie's not here, and Christina's not answering her phone,

22
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:06,930
and I have a thing.  So I need you to be a girl for me.

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,143
What'd he do?  You want me to kick his ass?

24
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,652
He wants me to have a baby.

25
00:01:11,653 --> 00:01:13,141
So you do want me to kick his ass.

26
00:01:13,142 --> 00:01:14,974
- Alex.
- Do you want to have a baby?

27
00:01:14,975 --> 00:01:16,414
A baby doesn't want me.

28
00:01:16,415 --> 00:01:20,092
I had the worst mother in the world. I would be the worst mother in the world.

29
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:25,179
Izzie wants to divorce. She sent the papers--

30
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,009
The official papers.

31
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:29,109
Want me to kick her ass?

32
00:01:29,954 --> 00:01:32,365
Hey, Alex. Hey.

33
00:01:32,366 --> 00:01:33,766
He's being a girl for me.

34
00:01:33,767 --> 00:01:36,543
- Dude, it's true.
- Right.

35
00:01:36,544 --> 00:01:39,604
Well, there's a guy downstairs says he's your brother.

36
00:01:39,605 --> 00:01:41,198
You want me to send him up here to the bathroom

37
00:01:41,199 --> 00:01:43,828
since this seems to be where you receive your visitors?

38
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:46,001
Uh, tell him to wait.

39
00:01:46,002 --> 00:01:47,993
Right.

40
00:01:47,994 --> 00:01:49,704
You have a brother?

41
00:01:49,705 --> 00:01:52,153
Yeah.  Do you want me to go get rid of him?

42
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:54,659
Crap! What's he doing here?

43
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,654
Alex is the oldest, then me and then Amber.

44
00:01:57,655 --> 00:02:00,600
Amber's graduating from St. Savior's in May.

45
00:02:00,601 --> 00:02:02,481
She's... she's smart, like Alex.

46
00:02:02,482 --> 00:02:04,215
She could go to college if she wanted to,

47
00:02:04,216 --> 00:02:06,586
but she's like, "What's the point?" you know?

48
00:02:06,587 --> 00:02:08,129
And I don't know what to tell her.

49
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,616
Alex is the doctor in the family.  I just move people for a living.

50
00:02:10,617 --> 00:02:14,941
- Hey.  What are you doing here?
- Man. You got old.

51
00:02:16,176 --> 00:02:17,751
Hey. Dude, uh, what are you doing here?

52
00:02:17,752 --> 00:02:19,523
I had to drive to Portland on a job,

53
00:02:19,524 --> 00:02:20,951
and since I was in the neighborhood...

54
00:02:20,952 --> 00:02:22,457
well, Portland's not in the neighborhood.

55
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:24,274
It's three hours.  I do three hours in my sleep.

56
00:02:24,275 --> 00:02:27,374
Alex, he's your brother.  He's allowed to come say hi.

57
00:02:28,063 --> 00:02:30,854
You're gonna be late for pre-rounds.

58
00:02:30,855 --> 00:02:34,818
Okay.  Well, it--it was very nice to meet you.  I'm Lexie by the way.

59
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:37,072
I'm overdue for a visit.  It's been seven years.

60
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,523
No, it has not.

61
00:02:38,524 --> 00:02:40,373
Since you've been home.  Seven years.

62
00:02:40,374 --> 00:02:44,851
- You haven't been home in seven years?
- Derek. I have this.

63
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:47,641
- Mm-hmm. Hey I'm Derek.  Nice meeting you.
- Aaron.

64
00:02:47,642 --> 00:02:49,427
Take care.
I'll see you.

65
00:02:49,428 --> 00:02:52,439
-Meredith, by the way.
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

66
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,830
Has it been seven years?

67
00:02:54,831 --> 00:02:56,521
Amber was 10 the last time we saw you.

68
00:02:56,522 --> 00:02:58,531
Aaron, what's going on?
What do you want?

69
00:02:58,532 --> 00:03:01,236
I do miss you, okay?
And I-I did want to say hi,

70
00:03:01,237 --> 00:03:05,843
but since you're a doctor,
I thought I'd ask...

71
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,935
should I be worried
about this?

72
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:13,709
Grey's Anatomy S06E19
Sympathy for the Parents

73
00:03:20,309 --> 00:03:22,598
- Thank you. Cappuccino.
- Cappuccino.

74
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:24,609
So... how'd the date go with Teddy?

75
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,184
I don't know if I'd call it a date.

76
00:03:26,185 --> 00:03:29,820
Doesn't going on a date imploy actually going somewhere?

77
00:03:29,821 --> 00:03:33,063
Oh, shut up.
You had sex?

78
00:03:33,064 --> 00:03:35,185
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

79
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:42,378
Oh! Pound cake.

80
00:03:42,379 --> 00:03:44,022
- I love pound cake.
- Thank you.

81
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:46,459
Rich, buttery pound cake.

82
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,938
Mm.
Yum. Pound cake.

83
00:03:53,808 --> 00:03:55,854
- Pound cake?
- Oh, I'm good. Thanks.

84
00:03:57,043 --> 00:03:59,575
So what exactly constitutes
a pound cake?

85
00:03:59,922 --> 00:04:04,145
It's a yellow cake...
There you go.

86
00:04:04,146 --> 00:04:06,876
Kinda heavy.
Come on.  Code for
something dirty, right?

87
00:04:06,877 --> 00:04:09,770
Like "You eat her pound cake.
She eats your pound cake"?

88
00:04:09,771 --> 00:04:11,171
No.

89
00:04:11,172 --> 00:04:13,463
Oh, please tell me it's dirty,

90
00:04:13,464 --> 00:04:16,212
because otherwise, that was
the most boring conversation
I've ever been a part of.

91
00:04:16,213 --> 00:04:19,685
We are talking about pound cake
because I want a kid,
and she doesn't,

92
00:04:19,686 --> 00:04:21,278
and we're not
talking about that.

93
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,206
How long are you two not
gonna have that conversation--

94
00:04:24,207 --> 00:04:26,866
a year, two years, five?

95
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,453
Wow. So...

96
00:04:28,454 --> 00:04:30,908
You and Teddy
ate pound cake together.

97
00:04:30,909 --> 00:04:33,959
- You're changing the subject
- You like how I did that?

98
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,919
So how was it?

99
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,935
- Mind-Blowing.
- Yeah?

100
00:04:37,936 --> 00:04:39,723
I pounded her cake.
She pounded mine.

101
00:04:39,724 --> 00:04:42,132
- Good
- Excellent pound caking.

102
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:43,857
"Pound caking"
is not a thing.

103
00:04:43,858 --> 00:04:45,258
Whatever.

104
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:47,526
I blew her mind.

105
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:48,961
Life-changing?
Life-changing,
earth-shattering.

106
00:04:48,962 --> 00:04:50,362
the point is, he's a legend
for a reason.

107
00:04:50,363 --> 00:04:52,609
I mean, he has skills that
I never even knew existed.

108
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,706
It was like there was
a-a party going on.

109
00:04:54,707 --> 00:04:56,970
- A party in your panties.
- Oh.

110
00:04:59,876 --> 00:05:01,276
Morning.

111
00:05:01,277 --> 00:05:03,331
- Good morning.
- Hi

112
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:12,559
Okay, bye.

113
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,251
- Bye.
- See ya.

114
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:18,111
He's always so grumpy.

115
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:21,774
He's going through something,
and Cristina doesn't get it.

116
00:05:21,775 --> 00:05:23,404
She can't
which isn't her fault,

117
00:05:23,405 --> 00:05:26,862
but I do get it, and... and I
can't be there for him,

118
00:05:26,897 --> 00:05:28,959
And that's

119
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,700
that's really hard.

120
00:05:31,701 --> 00:05:33,649
But you're seeing Mark.

121
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:36,127
But I'm seeing Mark.

122
00:05:39,075 --> 00:05:41,653
So then a couple days ago,
we're at the grocery store,

123
00:05:41,654 --> 00:05:43,218
Gary and I,
and the next thing I know,

124
00:05:43,219 --> 00:05:45,612
I'm flat on my back
in the frozen foods section.

125
00:05:45,613 --> 00:05:47,664
- She fainted.
- And I've never fainted.

126
00:05:47,665 --> 00:05:49,866
I never seen anybody faint.
I don't believe in fainting.

127
00:05:49,867 --> 00:05:51,269
Did you hit your head?

128
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,231
I would've if this one
hadn't caught me.

129
00:05:53,232 --> 00:05:55,718
Mrs. Clark is anemic
and guaiac positive,

130
00:05:55,719 --> 00:05:57,218
so there's definitely some internal bleeding,

131
00:05:57,219 --> 00:06:00,908
- which looks like
it's coming from a--
- friable tumor near the ampulla of vater.

132
00:06:00,909 --> 00:06:03,068
Yes, thank you for that,
Dr. Kepner.

133
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:06,091
Dr. Swender told us
the biopsy showed
the cancer was back.

134
00:06:06,092 --> 00:06:07,566
But she said you might
be able to take it out.

135
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:08,971
There's a chance
I won't be able

136
00:06:08,972 --> 00:06:10,715
to go in
as deeply as I'll need to,

137
00:06:10,716 --> 00:06:13,004
But I promise to do
everything I can.

138
00:06:15,204 --> 00:06:16,898
Anything you can do.

139
00:06:16,899 --> 00:06:19,501
We appreciate it,
Dr. Webber.

140
00:06:19,502 --> 00:06:21,891
Thank you.

141
00:06:23,398 --> 00:06:25,671
Thank you.

142
00:06:30,703 --> 00:06:32,305
I honestly don't think
I need surgery.

143
00:06:32,306 --> 00:06:33,706
- You do.
- You do.

144
00:06:33,707 --> 00:06:36,296
- It doesn't even hurt
that bad.
- You have an umbilical hernia.

145
00:06:36,297 --> 00:06:38,657
You need surgery.
So shut up
and fill out the paperwork.

146
00:06:38,658 --> 00:06:40,185
I think surgery's just
gonna make it hurt worse.

147
00:06:40,186 --> 00:06:41,586
You remember when Dad had
his Gall bladder out?

148
00:06:41,587 --> 00:06:43,689
- Stop talking and write.
- Write what?

149
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:46,588
I don't have insurance. Okay?
What am I supposed to write?

150
00:06:47,642 --> 00:06:49,042
Ask Bailey
to do it pro bono.

151
00:06:49,043 --> 00:06:51,515
- I can't ask her to do that.
- Alex, he's your brother.

152
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:54,603
- Evilspawn has a brother?
- Ah. Aaron, Cristina Yang.

153
00:06:54,638 --> 00:06:57,120
It's nice to meet you, Dr. Yang.
I'm Aaron Karev.

154
00:06:57,121 --> 00:06:58,914
Oh, my god. You're so nice
He's so ni--

155
00:06:58,915 --> 00:07:02,958
- Be nice.
- Why can't you be nice like
your brother--angelspawn?

156
00:07:02,993 --> 00:07:04,886
- Why can't you?
- Fair enough.

157
00:07:04,887 --> 00:07:08,081
- Uh, Mer, what's up?
You called?
- Ten times.

158
00:07:08,082 --> 00:07:10,811
Oh, well... Owen's still
in his dark place,

159
00:07:10,812 --> 00:07:12,833
and he's still not talking,
so I turned off my cell

160
00:07:12,868 --> 00:07:15,134
in case he would say something,
which he didn't.
- I hate men. They're stupid.

161
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:17,099
Derek asked me to have
a baby with him this morning.

162
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,094
Really stupid.

163
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:24,177
Oh!  Great. The pit,
with Owen and his dark place.

164
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,682
- What have we got?
- Cop with multiple GSW's.

165
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:32,460
- How many cops did you say?
- Just one.

166
00:07:35,153 --> 00:07:38,574
Officer Gina Thompson, 34,
GSW's to the hip and chest.

167
00:07:38,575 --> 00:07:42,341
Vitals--100 over 70,
pulse 118, respiration's 28.

168
00:07:42,342 --> 00:07:44,154
That's quite a police escort
there, Officer Thompson

169
00:07:44,155 --> 00:07:48,072
- I told those guys
I was gonna be fine.
- Well, yeah.  I wonder
why they didn't believe you.

170
00:07:48,073 --> 00:07:49,711
- I been in worse shape.
- Seriously?

171
00:07:49,712 --> 00:07:52,275
Oh, yeah.
You should see the other guys.

172
00:07:56,675 --> 00:07:58,258
You took down three guys
by yourself?

173
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:00,460
Hey, a girl's gotta do
what a girl's gotta do.

174
00:08:00,461 --> 00:08:02,378
Am I right, girls?

175
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:08,353
- How many bullet wounds?
- Four, but I'm wondering if--

176
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:10,186
no exit wound
for the right leg.

177
00:08:10,187 --> 00:08:12,788
- Probably busted the femur.
- I have to get in there
and debride.

178
00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:14,189
And trajectory seems--
Seems to have gone upwards.
- Breath sounds are--

179
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,604
All right, three chest
wounds can't be transthoracic--

180
00:08:16,605 --> 00:08:21,299
Oh, god, Gina, baby.
Baby, look at you.

181
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,569
I'm okay, baby.  THey're taking
really good care of me.

182
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:26,255
This is my husband, Jimmy.
That's Lieutenant Moore.

183
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:29,093
- So what'd you find out
at the scene?
- You were told to wait
for backup.

184
00:08:29,094 --> 00:08:31,188
Well, I was first on the scene.
I heard a shot.  I went in.

185
00:08:31,223 --> 00:08:33,310
You disobeyed a direct order.
You endangered your own life

186
00:08:33,311 --> 00:08:34,711
and everybody in the building.

187
00:08:34,712 --> 00:08:36,199
I took down three men
by myself.

188
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,043
And you got yourself
suspended for it.

189
00:08:38,044 --> 00:08:39,344
What?

190
00:08:39,345 --> 00:08:40,753
it's going to the review board
this afternoon.

191
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:42,802
You'll be lucky to have a job
by the end of the day.

192
00:08:42,803 --> 00:08:45,349
- No, I gotta get outta here.
I gotta go defend myself.
- I need you to take
a deep breath.

193
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,298
Breath sounds are decreasing.
She's bleeding into her chest.

194
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:49,284
- All right,
throw in the chest tube now!
- Get them outta here now!

195
00:08:49,285 --> 00:08:53,074
- No, I gotta go.  Please!
- All right, Gina,
just lie back.  Take a deep breath.

196
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:54,975
All you have to do is breathe.

197
00:08:54,976 --> 00:08:57,825
Dr. Webber, did you
consider doing a whipple
On Mrs. Clark?

198
00:08:57,826 --> 00:09:00,651
I did, but since
the cancer came back,

199
00:09:00,652 --> 00:09:06,051
I think I can do a local resection
and get the entire visible tumor.

200
00:09:06,052 --> 00:09:07,737
Dr. Kepner,
are we boring you?

201
00:09:07,738 --> 00:09:11,998
No, sir.  I just--I wasn't
expecting Chief Shepherd

202
00:09:12,033 --> 00:09:13,745
to be up in the gallery
during a general surgery.

203
00:09:14,572 --> 00:09:17,636
But I guess that's
the chief's job, right--
evaluating, observing?

204
00:09:17,637 --> 00:09:21,245
Dr. Kepner
you're in my O.R.,

205
00:09:21,246 --> 00:09:24,853
And the only one observing
and evaluating you right now
is me.

206
00:09:24,854 --> 00:09:27,112
Yes, sir.  I'm sorry sir.

207
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:44,908
With the orange or the red?
How's that?  Orange and the red.
You think it's gonna work?

208
00:09:47,404 --> 00:09:48,846
Dr.  Bailey,
you got a second?

209
00:09:48,847 --> 00:09:52,761
I do. I have a second.
which is why I'm spending it with my child.

210
00:09:52,762 --> 00:09:56,725
Here, look. Say "Bye-bye, Dr. Karev."
See him?  Bye-Bye.  Say bye.

211
00:10:03,635 --> 00:10:08,413
Dr. Bailey... My little brother is here,
with what looks like a, uh, umbilical hernia.

212
00:10:08,414 --> 00:10:12,754
I didn't know Dr. Karev had a little brother.
Did you know Dr. Karev had a little brother?

213
00:10:12,755 --> 00:10:17,745
- He has no money.  He doesn't have insurance, so--
- ah, mommy sees where this is going.

214
00:10:17,746 --> 00:10:20,474
He--he'd have to have you
perform the surgery pro bono.

215
00:10:20,475 --> 00:10:25,496
Ah!  Did you hear that funny word?
Pro Bono?

216
00:10:25,497 --> 00:10:27,692
Mommy's got a mountain of surgeries to schedule.

217
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:30,205
Does she have time to do free surgeries?

218
00:10:30,206 --> 00:10:35,971
And I'll schedule your surgeries...
For the next... week if you want.

219
00:10:35,972 --> 00:10:39,217
You think mommy should fix up Dr. Karev's brother...
And make him feel all better?

220
00:10:39,218 --> 00:10:41,588
Two weeks. A month.

221
00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:46,851
Well, all right. I will meet Dr. Karev's brother
in, what, half an hour.

222
00:10:46,852 --> 00:10:49,320
Say "Bye-bye, Dr. Karev."
Bye-bye.

223
00:10:51,448 --> 00:10:54,565
I woulda done it anyway, but he just kept talking,
didn't he?  You're so good.

224
00:10:58,827 --> 00:11:01,716
- Mr. Clark.
- How is she?

225
00:11:01,717 --> 00:11:04,460
She did great in there.  She was a total trouper.
The surgery went great.

226
00:11:04,461 --> 00:11:08,675
We got the tumor--all of it--
with good margins.

227
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:13,441
Oh, thank god.  Ohh.
Dr. Grey, thank you.  Thank you so much.

228
00:11:13,442 --> 00:11:18,615
My wife keeps telling me...
I need to be more manly about this.

229
00:11:18,616 --> 00:11:20,443
I mean, after all, she's the one with the cancer.

230
00:11:20,444 --> 00:11:22,324
She's afraid I'm the one who won't make it.

231
00:11:22,325 --> 00:11:24,311
I think you're doing just fine.
You both are.

232
00:11:24,312 --> 00:11:26,377
- Would you like to see her?
- Can I?

233
00:11:26,378 --> 00:11:28,457
She should be waking up any minute.

234
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:32,941
How is it your brother is a surgeon
and you waited months to take care of this?

235
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,736
I don't know.  Karev's are tough.

236
00:11:36,505 --> 00:11:39,244
Oh, I guess five years in foster care
will do that to you.

237
00:11:39,245 --> 00:11:42,796
- Foster care?
- You're all foster children?

238
00:11:42,797 --> 00:11:45,078
Well, me and Amber were in and out,

239
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:50,087
but Alex, he had like...
17 different foster homes in 5 years.

240
00:11:50,088 --> 00:11:52,712
So Alex was a foster child?

241
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:54,381
Yeah, because my mom was, you know,

242
00:11:54,382 --> 00:11:56,336
and it was before they had all the meds
that they have today,

243
00:11:56,337 --> 00:11:58,287
and she was--I guess she was doing her best.

244
00:11:58,288 --> 00:12:02,545
But my dad, he... wasn't a good guy,

245
00:12:02,546 --> 00:12:06,803
and he was... you know... whatever.

246
00:12:07,449 --> 00:12:11,340
And so Alex, he got shipped around a lot.

247
00:12:11,341 --> 00:12:13,720
And... he was a pretty rough kid if you
didn't know him,

248
00:12:13,721 --> 00:12:15,219
So people didn't like to keep him.

249
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,635
Then he ended up in juvie.

250
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:19,199
J-j-juvenile detention?

251
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,735
Yeah, 'cause my mom, she-- sometimes
she'd forgot to... buy food, so...

252
00:12:24,736 --> 00:12:28,393
he was good, though.  People wouldn't have
even known he was stealing anything if it
hadn't been for the video cameras.

253
00:12:28,394 --> 00:12:32,838
- How old was he?
- Mm, 11, maybe 12.

254
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:35,567
Hey, what are we doing with 28-07?

255
00:12:39,642 --> 00:12:41,984
Dude, are you talking crap in here?

256
00:12:41,985 --> 00:12:43,507
- No.
- Dude, I work here.

257
00:12:43,508 --> 00:12:46,555
So go to work. Uh Check the chest tube
in 28-07.

258
00:12:46,556 --> 00:12:49,112
- Go.
- Shut it, Aaron.

259
00:12:53,538 --> 00:12:56,721
- What happened after juvie?
- Dr. Bailey, I don't think that Alex--

260
00:12:56,722 --> 00:12:59,483
Mind your business. Aaron, after juvie?

261
00:12:59,484 --> 00:13:02,905
You couldn't expect me to just sit there
with a 10-71 in progress.

262
00:13:02,906 --> 00:13:06,364
I had good, solid information
the perps were threatening a 2-1-7.

263
00:13:06,365 --> 00:13:09,872
Baby, baby, your doctors are here.
Uh, We need to take you to surgery.
- Kenny, did you get that?  It was a 10-71.

264
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:11,724
Baby, he got that okay?
But you gotta go with them.

265
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:14,543
Wait! Look, this is important, okay?
They're gonna need a statement.

266
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,950
- Baby, what's what's important,
trying to save your job?
- Jimmy?

267
00:13:16,951 --> 00:13:21,238
listen, every year, you promise
me that once you make detective,

268
00:13:21,239 --> 00:13:26,725
we're gonna... buy a house,
have a kid and settle down.

269
00:13:27,825 --> 00:13:29,788
But...
Baby, it's been seven years.

270
00:13:29,789 --> 00:13:33,081
And everytime you get close to a promotion,
you go do something stupid.
- Baby--

271
00:13:33,082 --> 00:13:37,026
and now these people are trying to save your life,
and you want 'em to wait.

272
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,473
I'm not gonna stand here and watch you die.

273
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:48,388
I want a life with you, baby.
I want a long... happy, boring life.

274
00:13:55,862 --> 00:13:57,613
Tell me everything you did.

275
00:13:57,614 --> 00:13:59,429
I was trying to wean her off the ventilator,

276
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:01,577
but then I realized that she wasn't
breathing on her own.

277
00:14:01,578 --> 00:14:04,086
So I put her back on her previous vent settings.

278
00:14:04,694 --> 00:14:06,521
Wh--Dr. Webber, what's happening to her?

279
00:14:06,522 --> 00:14:08,526
She may have stroked out.

280
00:14:09,135 --> 00:14:12,107
Get a C.T. and get the scans to Shepherd

281
00:14:12,108 --> 00:14:13,621
and also run an E.E.G.

282
00:14:13,622 --> 00:14:15,783
We need to find out right away if there's
any brain activity.

283
00:14:15,784 --> 00:14:18,405
if there's not, then we need--

284
00:14:18,406 --> 00:14:22,876
She--she looks great.  Oh, thank god.

285
00:14:22,877 --> 00:14:25,178
Dr. Grey told me you got the tumor.

286
00:14:25,179 --> 00:14:28,687
Thank you so much, Dr. Webber.
Can I wake her?

287
00:14:30,008 --> 00:14:32,106
Sweetheart?  Oh.

288
00:14:33,823 --> 00:14:36,240
You still sleeping?

289
00:14:38,103 --> 00:14:41,587
the doctors said you did great in there.

290
00:14:41,588 --> 00:14:44,012
Honey?

291
00:14:44,013 --> 00:14:46,035
You awake?

292
00:14:46,036 --> 00:14:49,806
Alison? Alison?

293
00:14:51,402 --> 00:14:53,155
Oh, the patient's had a massive hemorrhage.

294
00:14:53,156 --> 00:14:56,651
Look, you see here?  The left temporal lobe?

295
00:14:56,652 --> 00:14:58,653
The hemorrhage, it's-- it looks like it--

296
00:14:58,654 --> 00:15:01,668
wow. That bleed is huge.

297
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:05,412
- What?
- You look even prettier in your scrubs.

298
00:15:05,413 --> 00:15:07,843
What are you gonna do about your giant stroke?

299
00:15:07,844 --> 00:15:09,808
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

300
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:11,621
Yeah. Mrs. Clark has a

301
00:15:11,622 --> 00:15:13,149
left temporal lobe, that's extended into

302
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,746
the ventricular system. There's nothing we can do.

303
00:15:15,747 --> 00:15:17,147
Want to get a cup of coffee?

304
00:15:17,148 --> 00:15:19,558
Only if you keep telling me how pretty I am?

305
00:15:20,807 --> 00:15:22,618
I've got three bowel injuries here.

306
00:15:22,619 --> 00:15:24,773
- You got anything, Avery?
- I found what did the damage.

307
00:15:24,774 --> 00:15:27,446
- You see the bullet?
- Lodged near the liver.

308
00:15:29,482 --> 00:15:31,639
Teddy, I'm looking at a devastator.

309
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,040
What?  What does that mean?

310
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,432
It means be careful. They're sharp
like shrapnel

311
00:15:35,433 --> 00:15:36,852
and they explodes on impact.

312
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,497
Can you imagine going to work every day

313
00:15:38,498 --> 00:15:40,478
knowing you're gonna end up on
the wrong side of a gun?

314
00:15:40,479 --> 00:15:42,493
I know. She is awesome.

315
00:15:42,494 --> 00:15:44,683
And now her husband wants her to give it all up?

316
00:15:44,684 --> 00:15:47,325
He's all like, "Let's start popping out babies
or I'm leaving you"?

317
00:15:47,326 --> 00:15:48,726
Why does it have to be one or the other?

318
00:15:48,727 --> 00:15:50,385
Because you don't have kids if you're facing
mortar fire every day.

319
00:15:50,386 --> 00:15:52,279
It screws with your head.

320
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,123
Is that why you don't have 'em--Iraq?

321
00:15:54,124 --> 00:15:57,471
Well, first it was residency, and
then it was Iraq,

322
00:15:57,472 --> 00:16:01,865
and now it's, I don't know,
waiting for the right guy?

323
00:16:01,866 --> 00:16:03,899
- You want to have kids?
- Wait. you don't?

324
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,297
Have you met me?  No.

325
00:16:09,763 --> 00:16:12,599
Okay, we're done here.

326
00:16:13,495 --> 00:16:15,319
- I think I feel it.
- Feel what?

327
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,911
The bullet. It's right next to the heart.

328
00:16:17,912 --> 00:16:19,452
There's still some bleeding.  Don't worry.
I got it.

329
00:16:19,453 --> 00:16:21,261
No, no, no, don't!  Don't touch it!

330
00:16:21,262 --> 00:16:22,663
- Oh, god!  What--what happened? What just happened?
- Damn it, Cristina.

331
00:16:22,664 --> 00:16:24,064
What happened ?

332
00:16:24,065 --> 00:16:25,870
You essentially fired a bullet into that patient's chest

333
00:16:25,871 --> 00:16:28,169
is what you did.

334
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,884
- That's my intestine?
- Yeah,

335
00:16:32,885 --> 00:16:34,559
and that part right there is supposed to be on
the inside of the

336
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,248
membrane, not the outside.

337
00:16:36,249 --> 00:16:37,857
Dude, that is sick.

338
00:16:37,858 --> 00:16:40,485
Can I get a copy of one of these?
I want to hang it from my fridge.

339
00:16:40,486 --> 00:16:43,042
Uh, hey, are we doing consults at the desk nowadays?

340
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,473
'cause I kinda need to use the computer.

341
00:16:44,474 --> 00:16:46,222
Oh, this is Alex's brother.

342
00:16:46,223 --> 00:16:47,779
Aaron, this is Arizona Robbins.

343
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:50,448
Oh, nice to meet you.
How come I didn't see you at the wedding?

344
00:16:50,449 --> 00:16:53,071
- Actually, Dr. Robbins--
- oh, that's right, that's right.
No one's family came.

345
00:16:53,072 --> 00:16:56,035
- Last-minute switcheroo and all that.
- What wedding?

346
00:16:56,036 --> 00:16:57,753
- Uh, Alex and Izzie's
- No one's.

347
00:16:57,754 --> 00:16:59,554
Alex got married?

348
00:16:59,555 --> 00:17:03,387
I'm just gonna go use the
computer over there. Bye.

349
00:17:03,388 --> 00:17:05,681
He got married and he didn't even call us?

350
00:17:05,682 --> 00:17:08,748
No, it--it--it sounds weird, but it was totally
a spur-of-the-moment thing,

351
00:17:08,749 --> 00:17:11,027
- you know, because of the cancer.
- Alex has cancer?

352
00:17:11,028 --> 00:17:13,654
- Lexie--. No, Izzie has cancer.
- Who's Izzie?

353
00:17:13,655 --> 00:17:17,955
Alex's wife. But... She's not really his wife anymore.

354
00:17:17,956 --> 00:17:20,436
- It's--you know, I-I really, I wouldn't worry about it.
- They got divorced?

355
00:17:20,437 --> 00:17:24,872
No, but they a-- well, s-she left.  And then, you know,
she came back.

356
00:17:24,873 --> 00:17:26,284
But he didn't really think it was the right thing--okay.

357
00:17:26,285 --> 00:17:28,990
Lexie! Stop talking.

358
00:17:31,146 --> 00:17:33,647
- You guys all right up there?
- There is shrapnel everywhere.

359
00:17:33,648 --> 00:17:35,048
I was going for the bleeder.

360
00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:37,118
I didn't even touch the bullet.
I swear. I don't know what happened.

361
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:40,102
When your commanding officer tells you to stand down,

362
00:17:40,103 --> 00:17:41,515
you stand down. Give me that.

363
00:17:41,516 --> 00:17:44,844
I'm not in the army. And you're not my
commanding officer.

364
00:17:44,845 --> 00:17:47,518
Dr. Altman and I are your attending.

365
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,120
And you are our subordinate. You do exactly as we say

366
00:17:50,121 --> 00:17:51,836
even if you do not agree. Do you know why?

367
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,612
Because we know more than you do.

368
00:17:53,613 --> 00:17:57,218
For example, we know that devastator bullets
have chemicals in them,

369
00:17:57,219 --> 00:17:58,708
And sometimes they do not detonate on impact.

370
00:17:58,709 --> 00:18:03,237
Sometimes the heat from that bovie is enough to make them explode.

371
00:18:03,238 --> 00:18:04,888
Do you understand?  Dr. Yang, do you understand?

372
00:18:04,889 --> 00:18:07,490
For whatever it's worth, Dr. Hunt, I would've done the same thing Yang did.

373
00:18:07,491 --> 00:18:09,260
Anybody would.  If it's a bleeder--

374
00:18:09,261 --> 00:18:11,620
The damage is already done.  There's no point in arguing about it.

375
00:18:11,621 --> 00:18:13,337
Let's just fix it.

376
00:18:13,338 --> 00:18:15,838
Yang, I need your hands right now, right here.

377
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:17,501
- Okay, you see this?  Hold it.
- Yeah, Mm-hmm.

378
00:18:17,536 --> 00:18:19,505


379
00:18:21,205 --> 00:18:25,405
Dude, how could you not have told me you got married?

380
00:18:25,406 --> 00:18:29,388
- You told him?
- No. No. It--it wasn't me.  W-well, some of it was, but--

381
00:18:29,389 --> 00:18:32,264
it was Arizona Robbins, and it was an accident.

382
00:18:32,265 --> 00:18:35,065
Yeah, she figured out your own brother would already know

383
00:18:35,066 --> 00:18:37,571
- that you married somebody, but hey--
- see, this is why I didn't want to tell you,

384
00:18:37,572 --> 00:18:39,544
- because I knew you'd make a big deal out of it.
- It is a big deal. You get married on the spur of the moment,

385
00:18:39,545 --> 00:18:42,164
- you walk out on your wife--
- I did not walk out on my wife.

386
00:18:42,165 --> 00:18:44,006
She walked out on me.

387
00:18:44,007 --> 00:18:46,037
You have any idea what mom's gonna do when she finds out?

388
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:47,494
She's gonna go off her meds.

389
00:18:47,495 --> 00:18:49,208
She's not gonna do anything because you're
not gonna tell her, all right?

390
00:18:49,209 --> 00:18:52,181
You're gonna get your free surgery,

391
00:18:52,182 --> 00:18:54,085
you're gonna get back in your truck,
and you're gonna get the hell outta here.

392
00:18:54,086 --> 00:18:56,173
Fine, you know what?

393
00:18:56,174 --> 00:18:57,783
I don't need your free surgery.

394
00:18:57,784 --> 00:18:59,487
- I'll see ya.
- Aaron, stop.

395
00:18:59,488 --> 00:19:02,091
- You're not going anywhere.
- I don't need your crap!

396
00:19:02,092 --> 00:19:04,754
You walk out on us, you walk out on your wife?

397
00:19:04,755 --> 00:19:08,452
- Like father, like son.
- Take that back.

398
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,008
Alex!

399
00:19:15,628 --> 00:19:17,206
- Get off me, man.
- Take it back!
- Alex!

400
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:18,668
What are you two fools--

401
00:19:18,669 --> 00:19:21,834
Oh, no, this is not hap--Alex!  Get off!

402
00:19:23,442 --> 00:19:24,885
Karev!  What the hell is your problem, man?!

403
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,710
- You are!
- Hey, hey, hey!
- You hitting people now, too?  You really did turn into Dad.

404
00:19:27,711 --> 00:19:31,582
Walk away. Alex, walk away.  Just walk away.

405
00:19:32,962 --> 00:19:35,438
- Um, give him some space okay?  Don't follow him.
- Okay.

406
00:19:35,439 --> 00:19:39,053
- Hey, uh, I need a gurney.  Run, honey.
- Right away.

407
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:40,852
She could wake up, right?

408
00:19:40,853 --> 00:19:43,917
I mean, people wake up from comas all the time.

409
00:19:43,918 --> 00:19:45,564
I'm sorry.

410
00:19:45,565 --> 00:19:48,081
Your wife's coma is irreversible.

411
00:19:48,082 --> 00:19:51,320
Dr. Grey, would you explain it, please?

412
00:19:52,865 --> 00:19:54,585
Mrs. Clark's scans showed a

413
00:19:54,586 --> 00:19:56,538
a massive hemorrhage in her brain.

414
00:20:01,431 --> 00:20:02,990
But that means there's hope, right?

415
00:20:02,991 --> 00:20:06,308
... Because at least there's activity.

416
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:08,345
And her heart is still beating.

417
00:20:08,346 --> 00:20:12,371
Only because the mechanical ventilator is breathing for her.

418
00:20:12,372 --> 00:20:14,209
When we turn the machine off,

419
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:15,804
the heart won't get the oxygen it needs,

420
00:20:15,805 --> 00:20:18,334
- and it will stop.
- Why would you turn it off?

421
00:20:18,335 --> 00:20:20,193
People can live for years on these machines.

422
00:20:20,194 --> 00:20:23,680
Mr. Clark, the advanced directive your wife signed

423
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:26,769
specifically requested no mechanical ventilation.

424
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,881
She filled that form out three years ago

425
00:20:28,882 --> 00:20:30,447
when the cancer was first diagnosed.

426
00:20:30,448 --> 00:20:32,350
The doctor told her she had six months to live.

427
00:20:32,351 --> 00:20:35,295
And she held on for another three years.

428
00:20:35,296 --> 00:20:37,840
She'll come back from this, too.  You'll see.

429
00:20:37,841 --> 00:20:39,579
You can't unplug her.

430
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,300
Legally, we don't have a choice, sir.

431
00:20:41,301 --> 00:20:44,552
But... she's my wife.

432
00:20:44,553 --> 00:20:46,080
It's my choice.

433
00:20:46,081 --> 00:20:48,402
It's your wife's choice...

434
00:20:48,403 --> 00:20:50,815
and she made it three years ago.

435
00:20:52,962 --> 00:20:56,134
You said the surgery went fine.

436
00:20:56,135 --> 00:20:57,753
- That's what you said.
- It did. But--

437
00:20:58,014 --> 00:21:01,321
No, no, you're not a doctor.
You're a child!

438
00:21:01,322 --> 00:21:04,712
And you're useless!
I'm done talking with you.

439
00:21:04,713 --> 00:21:06,718
I'm done talking with all of you.

440
00:21:06,719 --> 00:21:09,703
Who's in charge here?

441
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,839
He protected me my whole life, you know?

442
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,999
Kicked my dad's ass so hard, that son of a bitch never came back.

443
00:21:22,122 --> 00:21:23,751
I always thought he did that for me.

444
00:21:23,752 --> 00:21:25,636
But maybe he just likes throwing punches.

445
00:21:25,637 --> 00:21:27,434
Aaron, I like you. I do,

446
00:21:27,435 --> 00:21:30,299
but you can't talk about my friend that way.  Okay?

447
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,091
I need you to count backwards from ten for me, okay?

448
00:21:33,092 --> 00:21:34,684
Okay.

449
00:21:34,685 --> 00:21:38,082
Ten. Nine.

450
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:41,080
Eight.

451
00:21:41,081 --> 00:21:43,059
That's it.

452
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,422
A junkie dad, a crackpot mom,

453
00:21:45,423 --> 00:21:48,991
and somehow Karev still became a doctor.

454
00:21:48,992 --> 00:21:51,780
I'm not easily impressed, but I'm impressed.

455
00:21:51,781 --> 00:21:55,065
- Uh, prep him.  We'll go scrub.
- Yes, doctor.

456
00:22:00,016 --> 00:22:01,632
Dr. Grey.

457
00:22:01,633 --> 00:22:04,373
We're meeting Gary Clark in Shepherd's office.

458
00:22:04,374 --> 00:22:07,753
Five minutes.

459
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:16,381
I told a patient's husband that... she was fine,

460
00:22:16,382 --> 00:22:18,483
That the surgery went perfectly.

461
00:22:18,484 --> 00:22:20,809
And the next thing we know, she has a stroke,

462
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:24,179
and we are supposed to just unplug her.

463
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,446
And I know--I know that I am supposed to toughen up.

464
00:22:26,447 --> 00:22:28,183
I know that I am supposed to not care,

465
00:22:28,184 --> 00:22:34,123
but how... h-how do you not care?

466
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:45,954
It's the hardest part of the job...  The very hardest part.

467
00:22:45,955 --> 00:22:48,459
How did you do it?

468
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,177
How did you learn?

469
00:22:51,178 --> 00:22:54,390
I'm still learning.

470
00:22:59,351 --> 00:23:00,826
Why is her BP still low?

471
00:23:00,827 --> 00:23:03,218
- Is she still bleeding up there?
- No, I got it under control.

472
00:23:03,219 --> 00:23:04,875
We've had I.R. and blood hanging since we got here.

473
00:23:04,876 --> 00:23:06,372
but we can't seem to catch up.  Is her liver still bleeding?

474
00:23:06,373 --> 00:23:08,136
- No, I think we got it.
- No, Dr. Hunt.

475
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:10,526
Dr. Torres is right. There's still bleeding in the retroperitoneum.

476
00:23:10,527 --> 00:23:12,456
- We need a retractor in here.
- That's a lot of blood.

477
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:14,198
Avery, get in there, suction.

478
00:23:14,199 --> 00:23:15,888
- Can you see where it's coming from?
- I can't see past the clots.  Avery?

479
00:23:15,889 --> 00:23:18,740
- The suction's clogging now.
- Let's use our hands and scoop.  Come on. Let's get in there.

480
00:23:18,741 --> 00:23:21,714
Did you check the uterine artery?  That could be the source.

481
00:23:21,715 --> 00:23:23,236
Down to 64 over 32.

482
00:23:23,237 --> 00:23:24,778
We gotta stop this thing or we're gonna lose her.

483
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:26,492
If we hadn't been distracted by artillery in the O.R.,

484
00:23:26,493 --> 00:23:28,373
we might have found this bleed earlier.

485
00:23:28,374 --> 00:23:31,697
Hunt, not now.

486
00:23:56,406 --> 00:23:57,872
That was, um...

487
00:23:57,873 --> 00:24:00,764
that was our fault in there.  We were speaking in shorthand.

488
00:24:00,765 --> 00:24:02,631
We forget sometimes that you guys are civilians

489
00:24:02,632 --> 00:24:04,334
and that you don't know about ballistics.

490
00:24:04,335 --> 00:24:06,469
No, it's not just that. It was...

491
00:24:08,101 --> 00:24:11,203
It's not the first time.

492
00:24:11,204 --> 00:24:13,189
He's been...

493
00:24:14,022 --> 00:24:15,903
it's been...

494
00:24:15,904 --> 00:24:18,488
he has been through so much.

495
00:24:18,489 --> 00:24:20,868
It's not like he talks about it.

496
00:24:20,869 --> 00:24:22,965
He can't

497
00:24:22,966 --> 00:24:26,007
I mean, I can't talk about it either most days.

498
00:24:26,008 --> 00:24:27,956
But... Owen had it worse than me.

499
00:24:27,957 --> 00:24:30,741
He has it worse. He's triggered.

500
00:24:30,742 --> 00:24:33,272
Right now, he's triggered, and his triggers might never go away.

501
00:24:33,273 --> 00:24:35,014
I mean, they'll get better over time,

502
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:37,028
if you give him time, which you should,

503
00:24:37,029 --> 00:24:39,809
because he is in love with you.

504
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:43,407
- He just needs time.
- He needs therapy.

505
00:24:43,408 --> 00:24:45,097
I-I keep telling him to go to Dr. Wyatt--

506
00:24:45,098 --> 00:24:47,070
no, don't--don't--don't do that.

507
00:24:47,071 --> 00:24:49,244
He won't go if you tell him to.

508
00:24:49,245 --> 00:24:52,155
He's... he's very...

509
00:24:52,156 --> 00:24:54,233
he's a guy that way, a man.

510
00:24:54,234 --> 00:24:55,840
Don't ever tell him what to do.

511
00:24:55,841 --> 00:25:00,960
Just... just tell him how you feel.

512
00:25:06,374 --> 00:25:09,500
When's the best time to have kids?

513
00:25:10,911 --> 00:25:16,265
The best time to have kids... is never.

514
00:25:16,266 --> 00:25:17,894
Well, you asked.

515
00:25:17,895 --> 00:25:19,353
Well, yeah, but--

516
00:25:19,354 --> 00:25:22,061
They cry all the time, nonstop.

517
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:24,754
They never sleep. They're terrible conversationalists.

518
00:25:24,755 --> 00:25:26,938
And they take everything you've got--

519
00:25:26,939 --> 00:25:31,002
all your time, all your focus, all your patience, all your sleep,

520
00:25:31,003 --> 00:25:36,177
Everything--till you've got nothing left for you.

521
00:25:36,178 --> 00:25:39,879
But this morning, little Tuck woke me up

522
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:45,432
by... putting his nose up against mine-- his cold, little nose.

523
00:25:45,433 --> 00:25:49,262
And he goes "wake up".

524
00:25:49,263 --> 00:25:51,056
And he got the "K" sound in "Wake."

525
00:25:51,057 --> 00:25:52,623
"Wake up."

526
00:25:52,624 --> 00:25:55,265
See, up until today, he'd say "D" instead of "K."

527
00:25:55,266 --> 00:25:58,557
"Wade up."

528
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:02,406
Ha! Girl, him nailing that "K" sound...

529
00:26:02,407 --> 00:26:04,385
It's the pride I felt,

530
00:26:04,386 --> 00:26:09,290
the irrational unbridled, joy...

531
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:13,088
well, it's at least as good as any whipple.

532
00:26:13,089 --> 00:26:19,015
Look, if you're waiting for the perfect time to have kids,
you're never going to have kids.

533
00:26:27,587 --> 00:26:29,583
Hey.

534
00:26:29,584 --> 00:26:31,036
Aaron's surgery went well.

535
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:35,230
His hernia defect was fairly large,

536
00:26:35,265 --> 00:26:38,792
But Bailey was able to use mesh to bridge it.

537
00:26:38,793 --> 00:26:42,243
So...

538
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:47,204
He'll be waking up in a few minutes if you want to stop by.

539
00:26:53,533 --> 00:26:58,067
Mr. Clark, I'm deeply sorry for your--
for your loss.

540
00:26:58,068 --> 00:27:02,248
No, don't--don't speak about my wife as if she's dead.

541
00:27:02,249 --> 00:27:05,181
She's still here.  She could wake up.

542
00:27:07,111 --> 00:27:09,533
She's not gonna wake up, Mr. Clark.

543
00:27:09,534 --> 00:27:11,683
Not with the brain damage she suffered.

544
00:27:11,684 --> 00:27:14,898
- You don't know that.
- Mr. Clark, if we don't obey

545
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:17,187
your wife's directive, if we ignore her wishes...

546
00:27:17,188 --> 00:27:18,773
She signed that form three years ago--

547
00:27:18,774 --> 00:27:21,139
Her health will deteriorate. She'll lose body mass.

548
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,693
She'll have no immune system.

549
00:27:22,694 --> 00:27:25,320
She'll require around-the-clock care,

550
00:27:25,321 --> 00:27:27,690
And that can become very expensive very quickly.

551
00:27:27,691 --> 00:27:29,781
I do not care about that.

552
00:27:29,782 --> 00:27:32,327
It'll be no life for either of you.

553
00:27:32,328 --> 00:27:36,401
And that's why your wife signed the advanced directive.

554
00:27:36,402 --> 00:27:38,700
She didn't want to have live her life this way.

555
00:27:38,701 --> 00:27:40,832
And she didn't want you to live your life this way either.

556
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:43,921
Don't you speak for my wife.

557
00:27:43,922 --> 00:27:46,562
Don't you dare speak for my wife.

558
00:27:46,563 --> 00:27:49,762
I'm sorry, Mr. Clark, but the ethics committee has reviewed your case

559
00:27:49,797 --> 00:27:54,229
We are bound by law to obey her wishes.

560
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:57,379
If you unplug my wife...

561
00:27:59,153 --> 00:28:01,859
you'll be killing her.

562
00:28:05,331 --> 00:28:07,004
I'm sorry.

563
00:28:08,601 --> 00:28:10,154
You should, uh...

564
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:12,719
take all the time you need to call your family...

565
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,611
to say good-bye.

566
00:28:15,612 --> 00:28:19,974
There's no one to call. We didn't have any family.

567
00:28:19,975 --> 00:28:23,055
It was just us.

568
00:28:23,056 --> 00:28:26,040
We didn't have any kids.

569
00:28:27,902 --> 00:28:30,285
It's just me.

570
00:28:52,924 --> 00:28:55,475
He's my sister's husband.

571
00:28:55,476 --> 00:28:57,361
Excuse me.
- Don't play stupid.

572
00:28:57,362 --> 00:28:59,989
I'm not playing stupid. I am stupid.

573
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:02,154
I'm stupid and I'm humiliated

574
00:29:02,155 --> 00:29:08,082
and... I'm sorry. I just...
I've never felt anything...

575
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:11,892
I've never felt like this before.
So I-if you could just please forget what you saw,

576
00:29:11,893 --> 00:29:14,150
because I promise, you will never see it again,

577
00:29:14,151 --> 00:29:17,252
and--and we--we can just go back to being doctors.

578
00:29:17,253 --> 00:29:20,195
Please.

579
00:29:20,196 --> 00:29:24,207
- This day sucks.  I hate this day.
- Oh, god.

580
00:29:36,054 --> 00:29:38,678
You don't have to be here.
You can go.

581
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:40,638
I'm just making sure you don't croak,

582
00:29:40,639 --> 00:29:43,455
And then I'm outta here.

583
00:29:44,627 --> 00:29:49,109
You... saved my ass every day when we were kids.

584
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:53,012
You... you were a better parent than mom and dad put together.

585
00:29:55,276 --> 00:29:57,446
And every day, I feel bad for Amber,

586
00:30:01,434 --> 00:30:04,333
What happened to you, man?

587
00:30:04,334 --> 00:30:06,975
I send you money every month.

588
00:30:06,976 --> 00:30:09,742
I send mom her meds.

589
00:30:12,815 --> 00:30:16,403
You want that to stop?

590
00:30:16,404 --> 00:30:20,224
I am this close to being a real surgeon.

591
00:30:20,225 --> 00:30:22,776
I can't

592
00:30:22,777 --> 00:30:26,994
I-I can't be in that and do this.

593
00:30:26,995 --> 00:30:30,447
I can't

594
00:30:33,654 --> 00:30:37,147
Amber's a good kid.

595
00:30:37,148 --> 00:30:40,835
She turned out okay. You'd like her.

596
00:30:42,338 --> 00:30:46,511
You turned out okay, too, Aaron.

597
00:30:48,617 --> 00:30:51,525
I'm sorry your wife left you...

598
00:30:51,526 --> 00:30:54,834
or got cancer or whatever.

599
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:59,146
Thanks.

600
00:31:06,023 --> 00:31:09,232
We repaired the damage to your liver and intestine,

601
00:31:09,233 --> 00:31:12,486
cleaned out your fractured hip and fixed your lungs.

602
00:31:13,129 --> 00:31:16,681
There was a bullet, and some shrapnel near your heart.

603
00:31:16,682 --> 00:31:18,302
- Oh my God.
- But Dr. Altman was

604
00:31:18,303 --> 00:31:20,190
able to repair all the damage.

605
00:31:20,191 --> 00:31:23,145
Thank you. Thank you all so much.

606
00:31:23,146 --> 00:31:27,018
Honestly, I-I don't even know what to say.

607
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:29,121
There--there was, uh,

608
00:31:29,122 --> 00:31:31,586
there were complications, Gina.

609
00:31:31,587 --> 00:31:34,217
There was a lot of bleeding in the abdomen.

610
00:31:34,218 --> 00:31:38,070
The uterine artery was involved.

611
00:31:38,071 --> 00:31:41,422
We were able to stop the bleed, but...

612
00:31:41,423 --> 00:31:47,375
In order to do that, we had to... remove your uterus.

613
00:31:47,376 --> 00:31:50,464
What?

614
00:31:52,074 --> 00:31:55,030
We had to perform a hysterectomy.

615
00:31:55,031 --> 00:31:56,666
Sorry.

616
00:31:56,667 --> 00:32:00,606
She--she can't... we can't have kids?

617
00:32:04,821 --> 00:32:07,862
I'm so sorry.

618
00:32:09,102 --> 00:32:12,053
We can never have kids?

619
00:32:14,445 --> 00:32:16,042


620
00:32:16,043 --> 00:32:20,272
- Oh, god
Baby, it's okay.  It's all right, baby.  Shh.
It's okay, baby.

621
00:32:20,907 --> 00:32:22,762
Baby, it's okay.
It's okay.  Baby, it's okay.

622
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,775
How long has he been there?

623
00:32:39,776 --> 00:32:42,806
- About 3 hours.
- It's time.

624
00:32:45,074 --> 00:32:47,887
See it through.

625
00:33:00,741 --> 00:33:05,398
- Mr. Clark.
- No, please.

626
00:33:12,124 --> 00:33:15,716
I'm Sorry.

627
00:33:17,225 --> 00:33:19,022
I keep telling myself,

628
00:33:19,023 --> 00:33:23,432
that there is a chance she'll wake up.

629
00:33:24,732 --> 00:33:28,628
once you turn off the respirator.

630
00:33:28,629 --> 00:33:31,758
There is a chance...

631
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,946
Even...

632
00:33:34,947 --> 00:33:39,095
even if it's just less than a 1% chance...

633
00:33:39,096 --> 00:33:43,573
that she'll start breathing again, right?

634
00:33:43,574 --> 00:33:46,167
Miracles do happen.

635
00:33:46,168 --> 00:33:50,662
That's what-that's what she always says.

636
00:33:52,073 --> 00:33:55,093
Please.

637
00:33:55,094 --> 00:33:58,471
Please, Darling... Wake up.

638
00:33:58,472 --> 00:34:03,016
- P-please.
- I'm so sorry.

639
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,827
Please ...

640
00:34:10,828 --> 00:34:13,649
Please wake up ...

641
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:18,116
Please ... Please wake up, wake up.

642
00:34:19,198 --> 00:34:21,260
Please wake up.

643
00:34:42,474 --> 00:34:44,852
- Hey
- Were you checking up on me in that surgery today?

644
00:34:44,853 --> 00:34:46,741
No, I wasn't checking up on you.  I was observing.

645
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:50,152
You know that's the closest I get to an O.R. these days?

646
00:34:51,233 --> 00:34:53,254
I'm gonna choose to believe you on that.

647
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,673
They were married 32 years.

648
00:35:00,028 --> 00:35:02,071
There was nothing you could've done.

649
00:35:03,667 --> 00:35:05,337
I'm going home to my wife.

650
00:35:05,338 --> 00:35:06,899
You should do the same thing.

651
00:35:12,148 --> 00:35:13,673
Looking good, Gina.

652
00:35:13,674 --> 00:35:15,974
You're gonna be back on the beat in no time.

653
00:35:16,718 --> 00:35:18,969
What's what they call it, right, the beat?

654
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:21,215
Yes, they do, and no, she won't.

655
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:23,275
Jimmy and I talked about it.  I'm quitting.

656
00:35:23,276 --> 00:35:24,724
- What?
- Why?

657
00:35:24,725 --> 00:35:27,455
Well, 'cause Jimmy' right.
I mean, It's a job, you know?

658
00:35:27,456 --> 00:35:28,897
And I love it.

659
00:35:28,898 --> 00:35:30,894
But I love my husband, too.

660
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:33,949
And what, We're gonna adopt ten Haitian orphans or something?

661
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:35,430
Eight.

662
00:35:35,431 --> 00:35:37,844
- Well, congratulations.
- Thank you.

663
00:35:39,874 --> 00:35:42,475
Gina, I want you to know, I did the best I could with the review board.

664
00:35:42,476 --> 00:35:45,623
- Josh, it's okay--
- And they want you back on the job.

665
00:35:47,595 --> 00:35:49,117
Are you kidding me?

666
00:35:49,118 --> 00:35:51,380
Welcome back, Officer Thompson.

667
00:35:55,364 --> 00:35:56,892
- Oh my god!
- Hey, look out now.  Watch out.

668
00:35:58,867 --> 00:36:00,862
Thank you so much!

669
00:36:16,096 --> 00:36:18,807
- Where's Aaron?
- He went back to Iowa.

670
00:36:18,808 --> 00:36:20,683
You let him drive after surgery?

671
00:36:21,451 --> 00:36:24,313
I am not his dad. He's got my number.

672
00:36:25,491 --> 00:36:27,503
You know you're nothing like your father, right?

673
00:36:28,761 --> 00:36:30,751
You're nothing like your mother.

674
00:36:35,638 --> 00:36:37,654
You're good.

675
00:36:37,655 --> 00:36:39,077
So you'd be good ...

676
00:36:39,078 --> 00:36:40,699
You'd be a good mom.

677
00:36:41,761 --> 00:36:44,357
It's the most important job in the world.

678
00:36:45,441 --> 00:36:48,879
You probably should need a license to do it.

679
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,054
But then most of us wouldn't even pass the written exam.

680
00:37:00,754 --> 00:37:03,083
You ever wonder if moisturizer really works?

681
00:37:03,084 --> 00:37:04,491
I mean, what's in the stuff?

682
00:37:04,492 --> 00:37:06,679
I'm a doctor, and I haven't even heard of half of it.

683
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,519
Uh, "Dimethicone".

684
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,989
No idea.

685
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:12,374
"Distearyldim-dimo"--

686
00:37:12,375 --> 00:37:15,031
Hmm. I--yeah, I can't even pronounce that.

687
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:16,762
I want to have a baby.

688
00:37:19,461 --> 00:37:22,633
And I-I can't speak of lotion or pound cake or anything else,

689
00:37:22,634 --> 00:37:24,387
because you don't want to have a baby and I do.

690
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:30,812
So...

691
00:37:32,293 --> 00:37:33,896
we're gonna talk about it.

692
00:37:34,738 --> 00:37:39,235
Yeah... We are gonna talk about it.

693
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:44,108
Some people are naturals.  They were born to do it.

694
00:37:44,109 --> 00:37:46,455
Some have other gifts.

695
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,274
Oh, you're making dinner.

696
00:37:50,275 --> 00:37:51,775
It's just pasta.

697
00:37:54,784 --> 00:37:56,299
It smells good.

698
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,171
Are you baking bread?

699
00:38:00,738 --> 00:38:02,238
So, uh...

700
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:05,472
You said you don't want to have kids.

701
00:38:08,625 --> 00:38:10,317
What?

702
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,425
- Oh, the sausages are burning.
- No, they're fine.

703
00:38:14,426 --> 00:38:15,926
No, they're burning.

704
00:38:18,658 --> 00:38:20,158
Damn it.

705
00:38:23,183 --> 00:38:24,866
I'm sorry. I...

706
00:38:30,998 --> 00:38:32,604
Are you scared of me?

707
00:38:41,961 --> 00:38:43,974
I don't want to be.

708
00:38:51,387 --> 00:38:53,486
I have to go back to Dr. Wyatt.

709
00:39:01,331 --> 00:39:03,065
It's okay. It's okay.

710
00:39:03,066 --> 00:39:05,490
It's okay.

711
00:39:08,182 --> 00:39:10,058
but the good news is...

712
00:39:10,059 --> 00:39:13,143
biology dictates,
you don't have to do it alone.

713
00:39:13,144 --> 00:39:15,071
- Hey
- Hey

714
00:39:19,196 --> 00:39:21,108
I don't want you to be alone.

715
00:39:22,756 --> 00:39:24,901
If anything should happen to me...

716
00:39:27,092 --> 00:39:30,103
I don't want it to...
just be you.

717
00:39:32,009 --> 00:39:34,615
Well, we would make pretty babies.

718
00:39:35,299 --> 00:39:38,606
- So you're thinking about it, then?
- Oh, I'm thinking about it.

719
00:39:39,307 --> 00:39:41,592
You can waste your whole life wondering...

720
00:39:41,593 --> 00:39:44,758
but the only way to find out what kind of parent you'd be...

721
00:39:44,759 --> 00:39:47,162
is to finally stop talking about it...

722
00:39:47,163 --> 00:39:51,580
- but we're not making babies right now.
- We're practicing.

723
00:39:51,581 --> 00:39:53,222
It's very important to practice.

724
00:39:54,931 --> 00:39:56,711
And just do it.

725
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:04,795
Oh, you taste good.

726
00:40:07,423 --> 00:40:09,855
You have no idea how good you taste.

727
00:40:12,811 --> 00:40:14,726
Oh, Mark, I--
ohh, I'm really, really...

728
00:40:14,727 --> 00:40:18,980
enjoying myself with you.

729
00:40:18,981 --> 00:40:20,994
I-I am, but I need to, uh...

730
00:40:23,032 --> 00:40:25,077
I need to be honest about something.

731
00:40:25,078 --> 00:40:26,575
No, you don't.

732
00:40:26,576 --> 00:40:28,876
If you're honestly enjoying yourself.

733
00:40:28,877 --> 00:40:32,365
I-I am. I am.

734
00:40:32,366 --> 00:40:36,059
Then right now... that's as honest as you have to be.

735
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,898
Okay.

736
00:40:37,899 --> 00:40:39,942
Now, turn over.

737
00:40:39,943 --> 00:40:43,191
I want to try a little milk chocolate on your belly button.

738
00:40:55,507 --> 00:40:57,384
Ignore 'em.  They'll go away.

739
00:41:00,153 --> 00:41:01,653
I'll get rid of them.

740
00:41:06,379 --> 00:41:08,783
The baby's coming!

741
00:41:08,784 --> 00:41:10,778
The baby's coming right now!

742
00:41:10,779 --> 00:41:12,907
Oh, the baby's coming!
