1
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,670
Come on.Come on.Come on.

2
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,000
Damn it.

3
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:19,750
Any first-year    med student knows that an
increased heart raten is a sign of trouble.

4
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,480
- All day of this.
- All day stuck with stevens.

5
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:25,660
Why are we in the clinic?

6
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,500
I thought we were
supposed to be surgeons.

7
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:31,780
Oh,not today we're not.Today is
gonna be about flu shots and enemas.

8
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:34,060
What a colossal waste of time.

9
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,580
Morning.

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,310
A racing heart    could
indicate anything...

11
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:43,740
From a panic disorder...  Oh!

12
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,540
- Oh,god.Oh,i'm sorry.
- No,i'm sorry.

13
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,870
I,uh,no,i,uh,didn't even look.

14
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,760
- I'm sorry.
- No,no.

15
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,180
What--what are
you-- no,no,no.

16
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:50,800
I-i'll leave.I'll leave.

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,380
No.

18
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,840
Sleep.You've been here all night.

19
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:59,660
Uh... How do you know that
i've been here all night?

20
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,950
- Wh--  to
something much...

21
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,670
Uh... I just knew it.

22
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,090
Much more serious.

23
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,240
You should wear your hair up more.

24
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,170
It shows off the back of your neck.

25
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,550
I like the back of your neck.

26
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,500
A heart that flutters...

27
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,340
Or one that skips a beat...

28
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,600
Hey,i thought you were,uh,sleeping.

29
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,080
No.Hunt was in the on-call room.

30
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:49,100
You had dirty sex with owen hunt?

31
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,710
No.It's-- it's not
dirty and it's not sex.

32
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,640
It's... Xe i don't know what it is.

33
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,980
Could be a sign    of
a secret affliction...

34
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,660
Hey,how's it going?

35
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:00,730
Oh,my god.Thank you
for asking.It's great.

36
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,460
I mean,he's fun and he's funny.

37
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,630
Even with no sex allowed,i mean,

38
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,880
we--we just laugh
and we--we talk and--

39
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,520
yeah.I don't want to hear this.

40
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,200
Come on.But you have to.It's just,

41
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:12,120
you're the only one who knows about
us,and--and i'm terrible at keeping secrets.

42
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,190
Keeping secrets makes me sick.

43
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,730
Look,alone people don't like to
hear about the together people,okay?

44
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:18,050
Even if the alone people are alone
by choice,it's--it's sort of mean.

45
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,250
It's sort of like bringing
a six-pack to an a.A.Meeting.

46
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,400
- But-- keep
it to yourself.

47
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,470
I am.

48
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:25,990
Uh,i need a favor.

49
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,660
My mother's journal--her ninth journal--
i need you to pre-read it for me.

50
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,290
- Why?
- My mother had an affair with the chief.

51
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:32,790
Your mother had an affair
with her chief resident?

52
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,170
- Rock on,ellis.
- No,no,no,no,no.

53
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,250
Not her chief.

54
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,900
Our chief.

55
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,010
Oh,yeah.You'll go blind reading that.

56
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,920
Or it could indicate romance...

57
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,580
Which is the biggest trouble of all.

58
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,100
What is that?

59
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:50,850
What you think it is.

60
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:53,250
That's dangerous.People who carry
guns are more likely to fire 'em.

61
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,590
Oh,i'm ready to fire it.

62
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,240
That's not the
problem.She's the problem.

63
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,480
She spooks easy.

64
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:01,720
I have to fire at the right time,in the
right way,otherwise she'll panic and bolt.

65
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,830
- She's not ready.Do you think she's ready?
- I don't know.

66
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,500
More importantly,if you don't know,you
shouldn't do anything until you do know.

67
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,460
- Dr. Sloan.
- Dr. Hunt.

68
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,980
Oh,let's make this quick.

69
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,930
- So we good to go?
- Yep.

70
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,620
Use it wisely.

71
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,620
I'm with you today.

72
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,560
So,uh,what's going on
with you and mark sloan?

73
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,740
What?Nothing.Why?No,why,why?

74
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,610
What did you
think is--was?

75
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,610
Well,because you've been on
his service for over a week.

76
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:38,070
Yeah,you know,i'm--i'm
really interested in plastics

77
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,490
a-as a--as a specialty.I'm
fascinated.I-i like f-faces.

78
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,260
vehicular blunt trauma,right
shoulder,stabilized in the field.

79
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,560
Somebody help us,please!

80
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,480
Jen,honey,slow down,will you?

81
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,830
Please,please,can you help my husband?

82
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,440
I ran him over with the car.

83
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,790
Sweetie,sweetie...
You have to calm down.

84
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,100
- Okay.
- I'm gonna be fine. I'm gonna be fine.

85
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,370
Okay,i'm calm.I'm ca.

86
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,480
- Okay. All right.
- I'm calm.I'm calm.

89
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,920
Oh,my god,it's my brain.It's
my stupid,pregnant brain.

90
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,310
I left the car in drive.

91
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,720
Oh,god,baby.I'm so sorry.

92
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,220
It's a normal neuro exam.

93
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,270
Okay,well,he's got an inferior shoulder
dislocation and some associated fractures.

94
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,700
He'll definitely need surgery.

95
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,480
Sloan will debride the
burns when he's in surgery.

96
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:23,950
Surgery?Oh,baby.

97
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,910
Her b.P. Is 170 over 100.

98
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,350
give her 5 of hydralazine.

99
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,170
- Oh,my god.
- Sweetie,just calm down.How's the baby?

100
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,090
Kicking like crazy and
pressing right on my bladder.

101
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:36,080
Well,look on the bright side.At least,uh,she's
not running you over with a truck.

102
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:36,820
Thank you.

103
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,030
Hey,you wanted the s.U.V. Right?

104
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,470
Pregnancy-induced hypertension?

105
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,720
Yeah,i have to get her b.P.Down
before it starts affecting the baby.

106
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,000
Oh,nice couple.They'll have cute kids.

107
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,170
Yeah,not as cute as ours...  But cute.

108
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,070
What?

109
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,180
Nothing.

110
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,810
It's been three days--
three days of vacation--

111
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,870
the only three days i've ever
taken other than my maternity leave.

112
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,170
- Now i know i'm
behind,but-- bailey,i get it.

113
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:12,060
Jackson prescott was not an easy
case.I don't begrudge you that.

114
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:16,290
Okay,frankly,sir,i would rather
not work on another dying kid again.

115
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,450
But no need to worry,okay?

116
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,900
- I-i will catch up and
i'll-- i'm not worrying.

117
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,540
I'm promoting you.

118
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,280
I need another attending
in general surgery.

119
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:31,880
I'm submitting to the board that it
be you and that it starts this july,

120
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,850
the minute you've
completed your residency.

121
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:40,930
Now i know there was some talk a while back about
you getting tired of appys and gall bladders...

122
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:45,890
No,a f-full roster of appys and gall
bladders... Sounds just perfect,sir.

123
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,040
All right,all right.

124
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,920
But not today,though.Dixon's
requested you on her service.

125
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:53,320
This is subject to board
approval,bailey,though i'm not worried.

126
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,470
You have less to say now,huh?

127
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,570
Get outta here.

128
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:08,710
Dr. Dixon is not big on eye contact,so don't
be surprised if she doesn't look at you.

129
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,400
Also try to avoid physical
contact,uh,loud or disruptive noises--

130
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,460
she's okay,right?She's a good doctor?

131
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,430
Oh,no,she's amazing.

132
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,780
You couldn't ask for a better surgeon.

133
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,310
I'm only telling you so
you'll be better prepared.

134
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:22,450
Dr. Dixon,dr. Bailey,this
is,uh,dan and lisa pollock.

135
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,290
I need to see the
patient.Where's the patient?

136
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,920
Uh,right this way.

137
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,090
Uh,this is stacy pollock,age 9.

138
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,600
she's suffering from secondary
pulmonary hypertension due to a v.S.D.

139
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,410
Her e.K.G. Also shows,um,a left ventricular
hypertrophy,also evidence of right... Hi.

140
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,160
- Can i help you folks?
- Not him.

141
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:45,990
What's the trouble?

142
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,880
- Not him,either.
- Oh,uh,thank you.

143
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,790
We'll wait.

144
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:50,780
What about him?H-hello.

145
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,970
Yes,i'm sorry.Could you help us,please?I
would just-- we need to talk to a grown-up.

146
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,390
This is the chief of surgery.

147
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:56,920
No,just hold on,dr. Karev.

148
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,350
That doesn't mean i'm not a doctor.

149
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,500
How can we help?

150
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,660
- Uh,my husband and i,we-- our
children went off to college.

151
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:04,350
- One's at stanford.The
other's at,uh,u-dub.- Yeah?

152
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:12,150
- We tried something,a new thing and...
Something slipped,and we lost this-- rachel.

153
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,150
We were reading this
thing in a magazine.

154
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,780
Oh,here.

155
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,750
"20 techniques to reignite your nights"?

156
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,010
We did number nine.

157
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:35,520
- Um... Let's get you
in a gown so-- no,him.

158
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,330
- He did number nine.
- We  did number nine.

159
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:39,080
Yeah,i'm not the one
with it stuck inside my--

160
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,460
it's him.He's the patient.

161
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:48,060
Have a seat,and we'll take care of you.

162
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,790
Um... I'll... I'll stand.

163
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,460
you're taking him now, for surgery?

164
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,560
Yeah,it's a good thing.

165
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:00,730
We can get his dislocation fixed so we
can prevent problems with his circulation.

166
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,410
Her last b.P. Was
still up-- 162 over 102.

167
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,980
okay,well the o.B. Was worried
about placental blood flow.

168
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,460
Stay with her and just
try to keep her calm,okay?

169
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,880
- Okay.
- Cheeseburgers.

170
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,580
Painkillers are working.

171
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,830
Is there anything else
that i can get you?

172
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:15,870
Um,i'm okay.

173
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,630
Just--are you really
taking him now?

174
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:19,310
Yeah.

175
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:25,120
Cheeseburgers.Cheeseburgers.

176
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,580
She's,um,more relaxed when she eats.

177
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,800
Cheeseburgers calm her down.

178
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,380
Thanks for the tip.

179
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:40,000
Stacy has a v.S.D.,which has gotten worse over
time and has created pulmonary hypertension.

180
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:41,250
Does that mean she needs surgery?

181
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,340
- Yes.Unfortunately .....
- You okay?

182
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:46,500
If that child so much as looks like she's
going to die,i'm walking out of here.

183
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:50,860
I'll be performing a transcatheter
closure to repair the defect in the septum.

184
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,480
{a6}- That sounds dangerous.
- Is that dangerous?

185
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:53,500
That baby doesn't understand
a word she's saying.

186
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,120
All open-heart procedures have certain
risks,but this one looks fairly routine.

187
00:08:56,150 --> 00:09:00,470
She was just saying that we're gonna fix the part
of your heart that pumps the blood to your lungs.

188
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,380
It should be a simple patch repair.

189
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,450
Uh,probably something easy to fix.

190
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:08,000
But a full midline sternotomy
incision may be required.

191
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,640
Okay,now she's just making stuff up.

192
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,760
The nurses have some
forms for you to sign.

193
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:12,840
okay.Oh,i like your socks.

194
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,350
thanks.They're for soccer.

195
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,820
I'm the best on my team.

196
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,310
Mom says it's bragging.

197
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:19,910
Dad says it's not.

198
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,350
- It's just the truth.
- You can't fight who you are.

199
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,780
If you're the best,you're the best.

200
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:30,600
When you fix my heart,how soon
will i be able to play soccer again?

201
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,940
I missed half the season already.

202
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:38,580
Well... Um,we'll... Have to... See.

203
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,850
Ah,cristina.

204
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:44,770
Did you tell her about the ring?

205
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,210
Oh,i don't want to talk
about your stupid ring.

206
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,110
Good.Don't.

207
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,660
Oh,you're not gonna do
a big thing,a||re you?

208
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,660
Like some big,romantic mcdreamy
thing?'Cause she'd hate that.

209
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,010
Well,she built a house of candles.

210
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:55,050
Yeah,for  you.She builtyou  a house of
candles...'Cause you like that sort of thing.

211
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,290
- She doesn't.
- Okay,thanks.

212
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,820
How is it?The journal.Is
it gross?Were they naked?

213
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,360
No,not yet.

214
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,270
It's kind of,um...

215
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,690
Hot,actually,but,like,uh,chastely hot.

216
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,260
It's all stolen glances
and loaded exchanges.

217
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,350
The thing reads like a
victorian romance novel.

218
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,960
Oh,that's good.Chaste is good.

219
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,570
I'll let you know when they do it.

220
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:22,180
Dr. Gary ballard,please report
   to the information desk.

221
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,950
She said a thing about babies-- you
know,like babies were a totally ordinary idea.

222
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,560
She's not afraid.She's ready.

223
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,770
When are you gonna do it?

224
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,780
- Do what?
- Shepherd's proposing.

225
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,580
No kidding?

226
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,600
- Outstanding.
- yeah,thank you.

227
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,160
Uh,h-how are you gonna do it?

228
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,430
I don't know.I just decided.

229
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:20,890
Morning.Sir.

230
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,360
Shepherd's proposing.

231
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,170
Congratulations.That's a big step.

232
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,840
Thank you very much.You just
gonna tell everybody now?

233
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,720
You need advice.Hunt,you
ever propose before?

234
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,010
Uh,sorry.I'm not the guy to ask.

235
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:30,680
When are you gonna do it?

236
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,640
Well,more importantly,how
am i gonna do it?

237
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,620
So what do you use,like
a twist drill for that?

238
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:37,320
Uh,no,not if you don't want
a partial parietal hematoma.

239
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,240
Good luck.

240
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,030
Ahh... Just don't
tell anybody else,okay?

241
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,880
I thought i could trust you.

242
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,900
Of course you can trust me.

243
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,040
We got the short end of
the stick with this case.

244
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,600
Quit laughing.We're gonna get reamed.

245
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:01,180
Dudes,the patient can see you
giggling over here like schoolgirls.

246
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,170
- Enough wisecracks.
- Cracks.

247
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:07,010
- What's so funny?
- Sorry,sir.

248
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,510
These idiots were screwing around,and
i kinda got,uh... Sucked into it.

249
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,520
Enough.

250
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:17,880
Now if you children need a lesson in
professionalism,then come and see how it's done.

251
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:22,830
Mr. Kramer.

252
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,230
Your biplane abdominal
radiographs show a foreign body.

253
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:31,090
We will perform a sigmoidoscopy and
then proceed with manual extraction.

254
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,210
You'll get it out?

255
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,850
Oh,we'll get it out.

256
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,100
- Just hold it.
- That is the third time.

257
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,900
What's the problem?

258
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:43,790
- I-- she can't find a vein,and she's
poking me like i'm her needlepoint.

259
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,410
Look,what is wrong with you people?Didn't
you practice this on each other?

260
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:55,080
Look... All right,when you have a good
vein,it should feel bouncy,like this one.

261
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:58,570
Okay,now go in at an
angle,not at 90 degrees.Yeah.

262
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,110
Yeah,like that.Good.

263
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,220
Next time,she'll do it on you.

264
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,920
You know what,why
don't you run them both?

265
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,410
Listen up,you guys.

266
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:19,620
Before you run any more
procedures today,come see me first.

267
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:24,240
So... Clean bill of health from hunt.

268
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:25,730
You gonna get back on the horse,then?

269
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,810
Well,i wouldn't use the word "horse,"
but no.That's not gonna work out.

270
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,620
Things have changed.

271
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:32,370
I think i'm going to
have to break up with her.

272
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:35,940
You're what?What is
wrong with you?Why...

273
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,510
Sorry.I had to make sure
the patient's wife is stable.

274
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,800
She's hypertensive,and i think this surgery's
more stressful on her than it is on him.

275
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,130
Damn it.

276
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,280
There's a huge tear.

277
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,830
His clavicle fracture is
jutting into the artery.

278
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:49,800
Grey,hold this clamp.

279
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,700
I got this.I'll hold pressure.Page
hunt.Get him in here now.

280
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:53,720
No,they can't.

281
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,940
The patient's unstable.His subclavian's
bleeding out.They're paging dr. Hunt.

282
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,300
It doesn't look good.

283
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,400
Okay,thanks.

284
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:02,790
Oh,what'd they say?

285
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:10,080
Did they say it's going well or-- it's--it's
taking a little longer than-- than expected.

286
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,930
Okay.

287
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,970
But d-don't--don't worry,because
it--it's going great.

288
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,480
It is.Are you sure?

289
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:21,440
Yes,it--you know...  It's
good when they take their time.

290
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:25,840
You know,right now there is no reason to
believe that--that he's not gonna be just fine.

291
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,810
Okay.

292
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,990
Oh,thank you.

293
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,280
Hey,your pressure is way down.

294
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:39,620
Jen?Jen?

295
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,250
What's happening?

296
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,410
She's tamponading,her b.P.'S
crashed,and she has muffled heart sounds.

297
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,560
Oh,damn it.Okay,gloves.

298
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:11,310
Yang,betadine and get a local.

299
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:15,350
Stacy,sweetie,you're
gonna be all right,okay?

300
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:17,420
Don't worry.18-guage.

301
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:18,990
What are you doing?

302
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:21,610
Okay,lisa,you're gonna want
to,uh,turn around or leave.

303
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,840
You're not gonna want to watch this.

304
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,190
- Yang,keep the ultrasound over the effusion.
- Yeah,i got it.

305
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:31,710
Stacy,honey,you're gonna feel a little
pinch,and then a lot of pressure...

306
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,450
And then you're gonna
be all better,okay?

307
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:36,900
Here we go.

308
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:43,190
Good.Oh,good job,stacy.

309
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:44,690
Yeah,see?

310
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,920
It's all better.

311
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,770
Good job.

312
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:51,040
Good job,honey.

313
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:53,530
All better.

314
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,650
Her pulmonary pressures are high.

315
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,180
You're right.She's got cor pulmonale.

316
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,380
I'm moving up her surgery.Yang's
getting an o.R. Now.

317
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,650
I'll see you in there,dr. Bailey.

318
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:07,930
Let me know how it goes.

319
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,170
Great save,dr. Bailey.

320
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,710
I think you better stay.

321
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,470
I'm not scrubbing in on this one.

322
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,400
Bailey... You can handle this surgery.

323
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,760
Yeah,i can handle the surgery.

324
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:24,150
What i can't handle is feeling another
child slipping away right in front of me.

325
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:27,550
Mostly they don't slip
away,even the really sick ones.

326
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:30,270
Jackson was a special
case,and--and even he survived.

327
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,340
By the skin of his teeth.

328
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,310
But he survived.

329
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,790
Children are resilient,and
in all likelihood,

330
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:39,650
you're gonna open up this girl's
chest and fix something simple,

331
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:43,030
and then you're gonna hand
her back the rest of her life.

332
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:46,900
I'm telling you,bailey,you
want to be there for that.

333
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,200
Come on,come on,come on.Stabilize.

334
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,770
B.P.'S going up.

335
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,410
Going up.

336
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,090
Thank you.

337
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,500
Yep.Should be good to go.

338
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,670
Dr. Grey,jen harmon--
tell jen he's stable.

339
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,430
She's not.She had a seizure.

340
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,110
- A seizure?
- We got him,grey.

341
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,530
Go help her.

342
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,170
You're an idiot.

343
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,170
Excuse me?

344
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:26,840
You're an idiot.What is your problem?

345
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,480
He is proposing to her.

346
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:35,510
That makes little her his little sister,and
i can't sleep with any more of his sisters.

347
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,090
And she's young,and i'm her boss.

348
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,400
And i'm celibate.

349
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:40,730
What does that have to do with anything?

350
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,140
Celibacy is lonely.

351
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:45,300
Don't spend all your time
wondering what you are or--or--or

352
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,710
who you like or whether it's
right for you or wrong for you.

353
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:50,150
Just let yourself be happy,okay?

354
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:55,030
Before you find yourself
alone and celibate.

355
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,360
Does she really need a chest x-ray?

356
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,540
She's got the flu.

357
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,810
Say that after you've
ruled out pneumonia.

358
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,990
And be quick and efficient.

359
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:11,860
Keep a smile on your face,and make stupid,happy
small talk to keep them distracted and... Not panicky.

360
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,690
Okay.Should i do small talk now?

361
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,290
No.

362
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,920
Just tell me to lie still
and take a deep breath.

363
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:24,250
Okay,big breath in...
And then don't move.

364
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,410
So,uh,uh,how-- how
are you gonna do it?

365
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:34,050
Are you gonna,uh,go big,a
grand,romantic gesture?

366
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:36,920
Um... I-- i don't
know yet,chief.

367
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,250
I'm not sure that meredith's
a grand gesture kinda girl.

368
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,180
Oh,you want to do the grand gesture.

369
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,710
It's the opening pitch of your marriage.

370
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,360
It can determine the entire game.

371
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:45,950
You gotta go all out.

372
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:52,230
Now your plan should include flowers,candles,exotic
foods,live musicians and rowboat.

373
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,750
Skywriting is not out of the question.

374
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,360
- Now you gotta
go-- dr. Shepherd.

375
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,490
Yes.

376
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:59,760
Uh,uh,you got him.You
got him.Okay. Okay.

377
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,320
Um... What's up?

378
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,260
I need a neuro consult.

379
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:05,930
Okay.

380
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:06,940
Yeah,that's bet-- you
know,you better go.

381
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,040
Thanks,chief.

382
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:10,130
Okay.

383
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,170
Okay,okay.

384
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:15,820
How are we doing,mr. Kramer?

385
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,440
Oh,fantastic.

386
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,690
Good.

387
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,690
They didn't cover this in
the "what to expect" books.

388
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,410
They didn't say "expect seizures.

389
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,290
" i know.That's why we're
going to do an exam,okay?

390
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,600
Now i need you to look down for me.

391
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,980
Okay.

392
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,450
Ooh,what is that?

393
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,710
What?Um,dr. Grey.

394
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,220
Could you,uh,set up an m.R.I.
For mrs. Harmon,please,right now?

395
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:35,130
- But did you
see-- now,dr. Grey.

396
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:39,210
Okay.

397
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,350
Oh,you--you
saw something?

398
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,480
No,no,no.

399
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,880
No,i'm sorry.All right,can
you keep a secret?

400
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,820
You bet i can.

401
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,860
This is intended for dr. Grey.

402
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,360
It's supposed to be a surprise.

403
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,050
Oh,my god.And i almost blew it.

404
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,010
- Yeah.
- When are you gonna do it,today?

405
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:59,630
Oh,please do it today.
- Do it here so i can see.

406
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,590
No.I-i don't know.

407
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,840
No.I was told it's supposed
to be,like,a grand gesture.

408
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,380
Oh,well,rob proposed to
me in a supermarket aisle.

409
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:10,340
He said that was the place
he saw me for the first time.

410
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:13,420
So i said yes between the
cat food and the tampons.

411
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:15,210
That's romantic.

412
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,860
It was,actually.

413
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,490
We still have to do the m.R.I.,okay?

414
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,400
- Just to be safe.
- Okay.

415
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:25,120
- Dr. Shepherd.
- Yes.

416
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:28,720
- Should i be scared?
- No.

417
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,970
Should i? No.

418
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,960
Eisenmenger's complex.

419
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,970
- Can it be repaired?
- Is it-- is it too far gone?

420
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,350
Children are resilient,yang.

421
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,910
- Nine times out of ten,you find something simple to 
- fix...

422
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:47,920
What is it?

423
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,470
I can repair the v.S.D.,but this heart is finished.

424
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:53,510
This is one of the most diseased hearts i've ever seen.

425
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:57,540
Ecmo might hold her over,but without a heart-lung transplant,

426
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,860
she's going to die.

427
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,740
Dr. Bailey?Um,dr. Bailey?

428
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,530
dr. Bailey?It's okay,dr. Dixon.

429
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,970
I can take care of these sutures.

430
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,500
Her heart is too far gone.

431
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,520
There's far too much scar tissue to repair.

432
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,570
We have started her on i.V.Medications,

433
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,840
which she will need on a continuous basis.

434
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,620
For how long?How long does she--

435
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,700
until she can receive a transplant.

436
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,290
But... Months?

437
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,800
- Years,possibly.
- Years?

438
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,500
- S'll lay in a bed for years?
- I'm afraid so,yes.

439
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,770
Where's dr. Bailey gone?

440
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:30,970
You want to take narrow slices with the scan so you get a more comprehensive look.

441
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:35,080
What do you see?

442
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:41,330
Uh,i see... A crazy person taking expensive tests for no reason and,

443
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:44,550
oh,i see the chief finding out and expelling the crazy person,

444
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:48,760
and then,uh,i see,uh,joblessness,homelessness and depression.

445
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,750
Yeah,it does not look good,izzie.

446
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,250
It doesn't look good.

447
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,460
Somebody kick dr. O'malley out of the booth.

448
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,220
Hey,have you seen bailey?

449
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,980
No,but i have to talk to you.Derek is going crazy.

450
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:07,010
This morning i said something about having cute babies,and now ever since,

451
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:10,770
he's been acting weird and avoiding me and dropping conversations when i walk up.

452
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,540
I mean,he wants babies.He's always wanted babies.

453
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,060
Oh,he wants babies.

454
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,700
Maybe he just doesn't want my babies.

455
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,110
No,that--that's not it.

456
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:21,170
Yeah,because my babies will have alzheimer's and suicidal tendencies

457
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:22,520
and split ends.

458
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,510
Yeah,you might have something there.

459
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:25,400
No,i really don't think you do,though.

460
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,440
Who are you?

461
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,060
I'm jen.

462
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:32,900
How we doing?

463
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,150
We all set?

464
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:40,420
If--if you're gonna do it,do it soon.She's really freaking out.

465
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:43,560
Thank you.

466
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:49,910
They tried number nine?

467
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:51,930
Who does nine?

468
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,710
Personally,i'm a fan of five...

469
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:57,290
Seven,eight...

470
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:59,950
Well,pretty much 12 through 20.

471
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,540
i would try 15.

472
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,960
don't try 15.don't try 15.

473
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,340
i would try 16.

474
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,020
I've never done that before.

475
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,380
You'd try 16?

476
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,710
I would.

477
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:19,290
I totally would.

478
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,610
Um,don't do 16 too fast.

479
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:27,000
It can--you get hurt... Badly...

480
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,920
I've heard.

481
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,510
Do you know who likes a good 12?

482
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,200
Hey,you on call tonight?

483
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,660
Looks like it.You?

484
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:51,370
And you're saying if she misses even one dose of her medicine,that would be bad?

485
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:52,900
It would be fatal.

486
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:56,090
The drug needs to be administered at 3-minute intervals.

487
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:58,030
So she'll live in a hospital bed for years,you said.

488
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,390
No,no,there's another way.

489
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:01,470
There's a way she won't have to stay in the bed.

490
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:05,610
- With a diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension--  
- ane girl needs a backpack.

491
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:07,720
- No,no-- 
- a backpack-- it has a portable pump

492
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:12,820
that will deliver her meds and allow her to play and go to school.

493
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:15,870
She can have a childhood until she gets her new heart.

494
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:18,780
This is something that we should have discussed privately earlier--

495
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,220
and she could leave the hospital?

496
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:23,610
Yes,she can.See,she has to wear the backpack at all times.

497
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:27,550
We will put you in a program,teach you how to administer the medications--

498
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,900
do you have a prettier one?

499
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:33,230
Oh,my god,dr. Bailey,thank you.

500
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:35,800
Dr. Dixon,thank you so much.Thank you so much.

501
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,030
Dr. Dixon... Oh-- thank you.

502
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:41,520
No! No! No! No! No.

503
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:02,010
Dr. Dixon. What--what can i do?How can i help?

504
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:05,770
You can observe protocol,and i was getting to that option,but it was too much.

505
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:09,870
It was just too--  too much yelling,too much touching,too much...

506
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,900
Okay,um...

507
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,570
- Then i'll leave you alone to,uh-- 
- no,no.

508
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:20,340
I don't need alone.I need pressure.

509
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,780
- I... 
- I need my nervous system suppressed.

510
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:27,390
I need constant,deep...

511
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:32,210
Tight pressure across large areas of my body.

512
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:36,360
I need you to hold me.I need you ...

513
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,850
Um-- tight.Tight.Tight.Tightly.

514
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:45,160
Tighter.

515
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:49,140
You're a very tiny person.

516
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:52,220
I need a bigger per-- person than you.

517
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,660
Should i...

518
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,030
Oh,what--what can i do?

519
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:59,880
Uh,get over here and hug on dr. Dixon.

520
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,500
I was thinking more like a shot of thorazine.

521
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,520
Get over here.

522
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,680
Come.H--just... Yeah.

523
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:12,910
Good.

524
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:22,440
An aneurysm?A brain aneurysm?

525
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,910
All of your symptoms-- forgetfulness,dizziness,chronic headaches--

526
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:27,700
can all be associated with pregnancy.

527
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,910
The only reason we discovered yours is because of the seizure.

528
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:32,590
So what,you said you can-- you can fix it?

529
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,910
You can take it out?

530
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:39,160
We'll do it first thing in the morning,after rob's recovered from the complications with his surgery.

531
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,980
Complications?Wait,what?

532
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,930
You said--you said it was fine.

533
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:45,360
You said he was okay.You lied to me?

534
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,060
I'm--i'm sorry.I just-- i didn't want to worry you until i knew,and he's fine.

535
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,460
And you'll be fine,too.

536
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,140
But it could burst,right?

537
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,400
Jen,you  have  to stay calm.

538
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,780
You just told me there's a time bomb in my head.

539
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:59,670
I  promise  you that i'm not gonna stay calm.

540
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:20,330
Cows are squeezed tightly in a chute before they're slaughtered.

541
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:27,240
The chute applies intense pressure,resulting in decreased pulse rate,metabolic rate and muscle tone.

542
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,790
It calms them down.

543
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,560
It calms them down.

544
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,580
The same principles apply to people like me.

545
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:37,890
A hugging machine is used to relax the sympathetic nervous system.

546
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:40,350
It slows the heart.

547
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:41,900
This is good.Th--

548
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,920
it's working.

549
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,010
- Oh,so we can stop now?
- No.

550
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:51,860
Almost there,mr. Kramer.Hold on.There.Got it.

551
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,200
Oh,my god.

552
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,200
Oh,thank you.

553
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,730
Never again will i try to spice things up.I'm not spicing anything up.

554
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:03,100
Well,you tried to step it up.

555
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,980
Anything above number five deserves props.

556
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,090
Sounds to me like you're doing pretty good.

557
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:12,320
You're together,you're both bending over backwards to find new ways to...

558
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:14,990
Make each other happy.

559
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:19,040
You take a step back,you'll realize that you're doing just fine.

560
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,470
"bending over backwards.

561
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:05,930
" you can let me go now.

562
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,640
You can let me go now.

563
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,980
Oh,sorry.

564
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,860
Dr. Stevens,i have the blood test results.

565
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:21,890
What is it?

566
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:23,640
Well,you're anemic.Um--

567
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,310
anemic?

568
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,330
Oh,my god.

569
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,870
Do you realize what you just did?

570
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:34,750
Your face said i was going to die not "go get a hamburger.

571
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:38,260
- " well,see,i-i-- 
- that's part of patient care,controlling your face.

572
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,650
I-i just w-- anemic.

573
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,080
This is fine.

574
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,800
This is no big deal.It's,like,nothing.

575
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:50,320
How's mrs.What's-her-name?

576
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,360
That's not good,is it?

577
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,650
Yeah.No.

578
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:01,240
Um... Her l.D.H. Is off the charts.

579
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,360
Oh,what is it?Is it--is it cancer?

580
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:08,590
Consult oncology.Start a workup.

581
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:18,510
It's okay.We'll tell her together.

582
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,170
Thank you.

583
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:35,700
- I don't want to keep secrets.
- Sorry?

584
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:40,590
I've been keeping secrets all day a-about surgeries and rings and--and you.

585
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:45,650
And--and that secret,the--the--the you secret,it's giving me high blood pressure.

586
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:48,380
And i-i don't want that secret.

587
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:51,790
We're having... A relationship.

588
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:59,790
And if we are,if we're in a relationship,then i need to be in it in front of my sister

589
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,340
and derek shepherd.

590
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:05,840
If we can't do that,then i can't do this.

591
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:25,120
- what's going on?
- Sorry.

592
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,800
- What happened?
- I'm sorry,i can't.

593
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,940
- Just leave--leave me alone.
- You're shaking.

594
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,650
I... Saw someone-- someone i knew.

595
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:32,420
I can't do this.I can't.Just...

596
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,340
Please go away.

597
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,640
Okay,it's--it's all right.

598
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,550
- It's okay.
- No,no.I don't want this.

599
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,830
I don't want this.I don't want this.

600
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:44,960
- I can't do this now.
- To relax--to relax your sympathetic nervous system.

601
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,600
It'll decrease your metabolic rate.

602
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,370
You will feel more panicked at first.

603
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:50,230
You'll try to resist it.You'll try to resist it.

604
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:53,220
- I don't want this.
- But eventually you will feel your pulse rate slow.

605
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,130
- I don't want this.
- You'll feel your pulse rate slow.

606
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:59,860
Your breath will come easier.

607
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,530
I'm sorry for my outburst.

608
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:13,250
I should've spoken to you first.

609
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:17,150
It was inappropriate,but i've come to expect it from pediatric surgeons,

610
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:19,020
always breaking protocol.

611
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,300
But i'm not a pediatric surgeon.

612
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,560
I've landed a few peds surg cases recently,

613
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,500
but i'm getting back to general surgery the first chance i get.

614
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,340
You touch the child whenever you speak with her,

615
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,730
you explain conditions to the child,

616
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:37,790
not just the parents,and you react to the patient as if it was your own child,

617
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:42,110
and you break protocol which is inappropriate,except in the case of pediatric surgery,

618
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:44,840
where protocols are constantly evolving.

619
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,360
You are not a general surgeon.

620
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:51,280
You're a pediatric surgeon

621
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:58,640
Um,did you eat?

622
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,220
- Let me change.I'll come with you.
- No,no,no.I can't.

623
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,150
I've--i have to,um... Work.

624
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:06,090
Okay,listen,you have been acting like a basket case

625
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:08,910
ever since i dropped that stupid little comment about babies.

626
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:13,690
And i'm glad i dropped it,because if you don't babies or you don't want babies with me and my crappy d.N.A.

627
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:15,020
,just say so.

628
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:18,410
You don't have to avoid me,and you don't have to make up lame excuses about work.

629
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:21,460
Meredith,i want your crappy babies.

630
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,370
you do?

631
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:25,540
- All of 'em. 
- Okay.

632
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,710
- Do you want to eat?
- No.

633
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:30,930
I-i have--i gotta-- i have to work.

634
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:46,210
Oh,my god.

635
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,480
Did you use a bedazzler?

636
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,430
Circa 1986.

637
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:53,020
as seen on tv.

638
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,150
Dixon's right,you know?

639
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,940
You do belong in peds surgery.

640
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:04,530
My own baby almost died last year.

641
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:09,840
The doctors in this hospital-- my friends-- they all worked to save his life.

642
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:13,400
And i stood outside the room,feeling so...

643
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,450
Useless,so pointless and helpless,

644
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:20,870
like... I was losing everything in the world.

645
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:26,240
And when he didn't die,see,i knew i didn't want to be anywhere near that feeling again.

646
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:32,420
So i think that makes me pretty unsuitable for pediatric surgery.

647
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:35,340
I'd say...

648
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:39,900
That makes you uniquely qualified.

649
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,740
- You mind if i sit here?
- No,no.I'm just...

650
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,370
Overthinking.

651
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:56,490
You think he'll tell him?

652
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:01,170
If he's not an idiot.

653
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,210
Are you okay?

654
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:10,250
I don't... I'm fine.

655
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,990
Derek is a--

656
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:28,040
what are you doing?

657
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:30,090
I don't know.I just...

658
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,390
- staying here.
- Okay.

659
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:37,590
- Good night.
- Uh,he's planning to propose.

660
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:41,720
Wh-what?

661
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,770
The chief.

662
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:46,950
Your mother writes he,uh,told her he would leave adele and

663
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:49,940
come backand get on one knee and propose,but...

664
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,630
I don't think he ever did.

665
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:55,320
That's sad.

666
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,240
Is it?

667
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,390
Or romantic.

668
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:06,650
It seems we have    no control whatsoever...

669
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:09,930
Over our own hearts.

670
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:18,700
- hey
- hey

671
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,630
- Ortho,right?
- Yeah,right.

672
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,280
Hi.I'm arizona robbins.

673
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,680
Peds surgery.

674
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,680
I've seen you at the hospital.

675
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:29,440
- Are you okay?
- Yeah,no.

676
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,310
- I'm... Fine.
- People talk.

677
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:35,100
Where we work,they talk... A lot.

678
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,990
So for the sake of being honest,i-i think i should tell you that

679
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:42,970
i know things about you,because people talk.

680
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:48,700
You mean...

681
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:50,160
Terrific.

682
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,740
It is,actually... The talk.

683
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,750
People really like you over there.

684
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:59,320
They--they respect you and they're concerned and interested.

685
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,120
They really like you.

686
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:05,160
Some of them...  Really  like you.

687
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:08,240
You just--you look upset.

688
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:12,440
And i--and i thought that you should know that the talk is good.

689
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:16,790
And when you're not upset,when you're over...

690
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:18,600
Being upset...

691
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,660
There will be people lining up for you.

692
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:27,380
You want to give me some names?

693
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:38,810
Conditions can change    without warning.

694
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:41,490
I think you'll know.

695
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:50,090
Romance can make    the heart pound...

696
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:53,680
Just like panic can...

697
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,800
This is stupid.

698
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,070
- She's gonna hate this.
- What,the flowers?Girls love this crap.

699
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,300
It's a clich?

700
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,560
I'm a clich?

701
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,370
Clich?Became clich?

702
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:06,090
For a reason.

703
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,760
Because they worked.

704
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,910
It's great,isn't it,when you feel so strongly for someone,

705
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:17,470
and it's... It's not just about the sex?

706
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:20,320
It is...

707
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,430
It's true.

708
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:27,310
You should not talk like that.

709
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,510
Yeah,you're right.

710
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,830
Well,you're all set here.I'm gonna leave you to it.

711
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:33,650
Thanks.

712
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:39,350
Congratulations.

713
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,700
Thanks.

714
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,150
And panic...

715
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:53,180
Addison?

716
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:56,250
Can make it stop cold    in your chest.

717
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,970
What happened?

718
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:16,860
It's no wonder    doctors spend so much time   trying to keep the heart stable...

719
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:22,730
To keep it slow...

720
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:29,090
Steady...

721
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:31,960
Regular...

722
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:38,490
To stop the heart from pounding out of your chest...

723
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:41,260
From the dread    of something terrible...

724
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:46,460
Or the anticipation...

725
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:03,970
Of something else entirely.
