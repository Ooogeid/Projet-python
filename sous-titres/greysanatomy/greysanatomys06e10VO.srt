1
00:00:04,808 --> 00:00:07,434
<i>The best gift I ever got
was for christmas</i>

2
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:10,209
<i>when I was 10...
my very first suture kit.</i>

3
00:00:11,533 --> 00:00:13,464
<i>I used it until my fingers bled,</i>

4
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:16,689
<i>and then I tried to use it
to stitch up my fingers.</i>

5
00:00:17,599 --> 00:00:19,089
Thank you for meeting me.

6
00:00:19,214 --> 00:00:21,854
You're the Chief of surgery.
If you page, I'm here.

7
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:25,666
<i>It put me on the path
to becoming a surgeon.</i>

8
00:00:30,181 --> 00:00:31,881
I want to say something.

9
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,450
I need to say something...

10
00:00:35,173 --> 00:00:37,036
About what happened the other night.

11
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,456
I need you to know it wasn't...

12
00:00:41,515 --> 00:00:43,501
Well, it isn't what you think.

13
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,486
I don't think anything
about your personal life, sir.

14
00:00:55,212 --> 00:00:56,612
I had a problem...

15
00:00:57,109 --> 00:00:58,409
A long time ago.

16
00:00:59,123 --> 00:01:01,223
I was diagnosed with alcoholism.

17
00:01:01,732 --> 00:01:03,332
Or I diagnosed myself.

18
00:01:04,248 --> 00:01:07,566
And I didn't take a drink
for almost 20 years.

19
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,397
But I think it was a misdiagnosis.

20
00:01:10,522 --> 00:01:13,239
I'm not saying my drinking
wasn't bad, because it was.

21
00:01:13,678 --> 00:01:15,728
But there is such a thing as...

22
00:01:16,964 --> 00:01:18,614
situational depression.

23
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,343
And I think that's what
I was suffering from, and

24
00:01:22,468 --> 00:01:24,218
it escalated my drinking.

25
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,068
Situational depression?

26
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,438
Your mother.

27
00:01:29,563 --> 00:01:32,513
Yes. Well, she escalated
my drinking, too, so...

28
00:01:36,969 --> 00:01:39,169
Have you told anyone what you saw?

29
00:01:39,495 --> 00:01:40,850
Have you told Derek?

30
00:01:49,224 --> 00:01:51,924
Since I took a step back
from surgery, I've

31
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:53,699
had some time to really

32
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:55,683
look at our residents.

33
00:01:56,443 --> 00:01:57,743
And your work...

34
00:01:59,156 --> 00:02:01,328
Your raw talent...

35
00:02:04,236 --> 00:02:05,586
is extraordinary.

36
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,080
A lot like your mother's.

37
00:02:10,186 --> 00:02:11,736
And since I have some

38
00:02:12,043 --> 00:02:13,223
time... some

39
00:02:13,797 --> 00:02:14,947
extra time...

40
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:20,723
maybe you would like a mentor.

41
00:02:22,528 --> 00:02:24,828
Maybe I could teach you some things.

42
00:02:26,954 --> 00:02:29,902
Have you ever done
a 2-layered, continuous suture

43
00:02:30,027 --> 00:02:31,477
for an anastomosis?

44
00:02:31,755 --> 00:02:34,429
<i>My point is,
sometimes the best gifts</i>

45
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:36,804
<i>come in really surprising packages.</i>

46
00:02:39,191 --> 00:02:40,291
Take a seat.

47
00:02:46,025 --> 00:02:47,325
You're about to.

48
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:58,509
Wait.

49
00:03:00,667 --> 00:03:02,932
It's Teddy.
I love it when it's Teddy.

50
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,875
Don't you think it's strange
that he's mentoring you at night

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,495
- and still not talking to me?
- Since the merger,

52
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,576
it is impossible to get OR time.

53
00:03:16,701 --> 00:03:18,349
And who is responsible for that?

54
00:03:18,474 --> 00:03:20,757
That's what I'm saying.
I need all the help I can get.

55
00:03:20,882 --> 00:03:23,157
And I am saying,
he is using you to get to me.

56
00:03:23,282 --> 00:03:24,984
- He is not.
- Then why now?

57
00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:27,080
Why are you suddenly
seeing so much of him?

58
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:28,921
I'm done talking about this.

59
00:03:29,046 --> 00:03:30,648
If you want to stay mad, stay mad.

60
00:03:30,773 --> 00:03:33,273
But I'm just gonna be here
kissing you.

61
00:03:36,881 --> 00:03:37,984
Oh, my God.

62
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:40,302
That is the biggest pseudoaneurysm
I've ever seen.

63
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,360
It's at the suture line
of the transplant.

64
00:03:42,485 --> 00:03:44,043
The new heart is dying. Damn it.

65
00:03:44,168 --> 00:03:46,932
Poor guy that brought her in.
I think they were on their third date.

66
00:03:47,057 --> 00:03:48,789
It doesn't even look
like a heart anymore.

67
00:03:48,914 --> 00:03:50,198
That's because it's not.

68
00:03:50,323 --> 00:03:53,453
It's a chunk of useless flesh
that has to come out right now.

69
00:03:53,578 --> 00:03:56,360
You're taking the heart out?
What are you gonna replace it with?

70
00:03:57,157 --> 00:03:59,889
I don't know. We're gonna have
to figure it out as we go.

71
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,533
<i>Saison 06 épisode 10
Holidaze</i>

72
00:04:04,754 --> 00:04:06,673
okay, wait.
Let me get this straight.

73
00:04:06,798 --> 00:04:08,898
- You removed her heart?
- Yes.

74
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:13,055
And she can live that way?
Like what, like a vampire?

75
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,028
Usually you'd connect a ventricular
assist device to the heart,

76
00:04:16,153 --> 00:04:19,301
- but since she doesn't have a heart...
- Dr. Altman attached two,

77
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,476
devices to her blood vessels.

78
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,471
Now this machine now pumps
the blood through her body,

79
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,926
which is basically, a miracle.

80
00:04:27,051 --> 00:04:29,639
I really like her. I like her a lot.

81
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,628
But we've only had four dates.

82
00:04:31,753 --> 00:04:34,575
I'm supposed to have thanksgiving
with my family, you know?

83
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,550
She was gonna join us.
And now she's like a...

84
00:04:38,886 --> 00:04:40,605
She can really live without a heart?

85
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:43,714
If you don't want to stay,
we have a great nursing staff,

86
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:46,243
great doctors.
She'll be in good hands.

87
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,040
No. You know,

88
00:04:48,843 --> 00:04:51,071
she doesn't even have a family.
And if it was me,

89
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,000
I would want somebody here. So...

90
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,126
I'll stay.

91
00:05:00,704 --> 00:05:03,104
Tucker and little tuck
are both fine.

92
00:05:04,372 --> 00:05:06,810
I know.
I'm sorry I have to work today

93
00:05:06,935 --> 00:05:08,785
and on christmas this year.

94
00:05:10,111 --> 00:05:13,876
Tucker and I were hoping
to bring him home to visit you.

95
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:16,440
Mom I have to go.

96
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,184
Happy thanksgiving, mom.

97
00:05:19,964 --> 00:05:22,529
You didn't tell your parents
about the divorce?

98
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:26,348
- How long can you keep that a secret?
- When you started dating women,

99
00:05:26,473 --> 00:05:29,573
how long did you keep
that secret from your family?

100
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,718
- When did the bleeding start?
- This morning.

101
00:05:35,843 --> 00:05:37,943
He's had these before. I just...

102
00:05:38,316 --> 00:05:40,423
I've never seen
a nosebleed go on like this.

103
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,174
There's blood on Timmy, mom.

104
00:05:42,501 --> 00:05:44,901
Mr. and Mrs. Jacobsen,
can I see you?

105
00:05:45,026 --> 00:05:46,726
Go ahead. We'll be fine.

106
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:49,926
Nicholas has what is called
an arteriovenous malformation.

107
00:05:50,051 --> 00:05:52,300
It's a cluster of tangled
blood vessels in his brain.

108
00:05:52,425 --> 00:05:55,192
- It's what's causing the bleeding.
- In order to stop the bleeding,

109
00:05:55,317 --> 00:05:57,756
- we need to remove it.
- You mean like brain surgery or...

110
00:05:57,881 --> 00:06:00,943
I'll do everything I can to protect
the brain tissue and minimize damage.

111
00:06:01,401 --> 00:06:05,051
I'm sorry. I know it's scary.
But we have to go in right away.

112
00:06:16,714 --> 00:06:17,714
Excuse me.

113
00:06:18,648 --> 00:06:20,698
I'm looking for Dr. Mark Sloan.

114
00:06:21,354 --> 00:06:23,924
You see the dude who was burned...
trying to deep fry a turkey?

115
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:27,105
Sloan's the guy making him
scream like a girl.

116
00:06:32,634 --> 00:06:33,634
Dr. Sloan?

117
00:06:37,742 --> 00:06:40,167
So this is a little weird, but...

118
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:42,849
my name is Sloan Reilly. And,

119
00:06:43,075 --> 00:06:45,175
my mom's Samantha Reilly. And...

120
00:06:46,111 --> 00:06:47,614
I'm pretty sure you're my dad.

121
00:07:11,656 --> 00:07:13,756
How's it... how's it going in here?

122
00:07:14,313 --> 00:07:15,663
- Great.
- Fine.

123
00:07:16,947 --> 00:07:20,761
So have we broached the question
of a paternity test?

124
00:07:20,886 --> 00:07:22,845
Cause I brought supplies.

125
00:07:24,729 --> 00:07:27,404
She's 18. That's not
very much younger than me.

126
00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:29,132
It's not that shocking actually.

127
00:07:29,257 --> 00:07:32,993
The way Mark got around before he met
you, there could be a gaggle of Sloans.

128
00:07:33,118 --> 00:07:35,868
Sloan Jones. Sloan Smith.
Sloan Sloan.

129
00:07:36,985 --> 00:07:37,985
Mean.

130
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:40,876
Damn it.

131
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:43,462
Son of a bitch.

132
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,183
I can't access the feeders.

133
00:07:48,507 --> 00:07:50,967
- What does that mean?
- It means I can't get at it.

134
00:07:51,092 --> 00:07:54,306
I can do a temporary fix, but once he
starts bleeding again, which he will,

135
00:07:55,103 --> 00:07:57,150
there won't be anything we can do.

136
00:07:57,275 --> 00:08:00,020
So we're just gonna...
send him home to die?

137
00:08:03,137 --> 00:08:05,234
Happy thanksgiving, Jacobsen family.

138
00:08:15,724 --> 00:08:17,674
- Nice day.
- Little chilly.

139
00:08:23,301 --> 00:08:26,046
- It's brisk, though. It's not cold.
- Right.

140
00:08:39,432 --> 00:08:40,436
I know.

141
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,904
I don't understand. You said that...

142
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:48,936
that he would die
without the surgery.

143
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:51,884
And now you're telling us we're
supposed to just take him home?

144
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:55,413
I've stopped the bleeding temporarily.
But the only way to remove the AVM

145
00:08:55,538 --> 00:08:57,250
safely is through the sinus.

146
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,980
- Why don't you do that?
- Because there are no instruments that

147
00:09:00,105 --> 00:09:03,269
can maneuver through a nasal cavity this
small and get the appropriate angles.

148
00:09:03,394 --> 00:09:05,251
Why not? Who does that?

149
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,712
Who invents those things?

150
00:09:14,401 --> 00:09:17,501
Now might be a good place
for you to say something.

151
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,740
Out loud.

152
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,080
Dude, are you, like,
high or something?

153
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:30,496
- Mark, I need you on something.
- I have a daughter, Derek.

154
00:09:30,621 --> 00:09:34,625
An 18-year-old daughter. I am
too young to have an 18 year old.

155
00:09:35,222 --> 00:09:38,799
It's a nail in my coffin.
It's like death has come to call.

156
00:09:38,924 --> 00:09:41,649
Can we put a pin in your
existential crisis for a minute?

157
00:09:41,774 --> 00:09:44,734
- That's why they call it a crisis.
- Dr. Robbins and I have a 6 year old

158
00:09:44,859 --> 00:09:46,180
with an inoperable AVM.

159
00:09:46,305 --> 00:09:48,755
We need your help
to make it operable.

160
00:09:50,693 --> 00:09:53,342
This is the best thanksgiving ever.

161
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:56,803
No obnoxious relatives.
No stupid traditions.

162
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,540
No going around the table and saying
what you're grateful for.

163
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:03,669
I think we should do the opposite.
Talk about what we're not grateful for.

164
00:10:05,001 --> 00:10:06,772
- The merger.
- The Mercy Westers.

165
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,483
They're like the plague.
I mean, stealing all our surgeries,

166
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:11,424
eating all that pie
in the nurses' station.

167
00:10:11,549 --> 00:10:13,278
- You're doing that wrong.
- I am not.

168
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,146
You are. Can I show you?

169
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:19,409
Private lessons with the Chief...

170
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:22,287
Those daddy issues
are working for you.

171
00:10:22,412 --> 00:10:24,831
I don't have daddy issues.
He's teaching me.

172
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,334
- You're his bitch.
- In that case, you're Teddy's bitch.

173
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:30,178
Maybe that's my problem.
I'm nobody's bitch.

174
00:10:30,303 --> 00:10:31,953
You were Izzie's bitch.

175
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:34,466
- You're the bitch.
- You know what? It's thanksgiving.

176
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,201
Can we just have no name-calling?

177
00:10:36,326 --> 00:10:37,545
- Please.
- Whatever.

178
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,721
Just show me that stitch again.

179
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:55,336
Welcome. Happy thanksgiving.
Who wants wine?

180
00:10:55,694 --> 00:10:57,072
- I do.
- No, you don't.

181
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:00,926
Everybody.

182
00:11:02,584 --> 00:11:05,856
The results are in.
It turns out Sloan was right

183
00:11:06,654 --> 00:11:08,579
about her parentage.

184
00:11:08,992 --> 00:11:10,142
I am her dad.

185
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:14,209
So here's another thing
to be thankful for.

186
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:19,886
Sloan here is gonna move in with us
for a little while.

187
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,550
Oh, my God.

188
00:11:35,685 --> 00:11:37,159
Now just ease up.

189
00:11:38,117 --> 00:11:40,217
Let the suture do the work for you.

190
00:11:40,342 --> 00:11:42,043
You know, it's like a dance.

191
00:11:42,873 --> 00:11:46,223
You let the needle be the man,
let it take the lead, and

192
00:11:46,348 --> 00:11:47,789
let your hand just follow.

193
00:11:48,877 --> 00:11:52,077
Look at that. I haven't seen
skill like that since...

194
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:54,572
Since your mother.

195
00:11:54,858 --> 00:11:57,234
That woman...
She could dance.

196
00:11:59,797 --> 00:12:01,797
You should make up with Derek.

197
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:03,722
It's christmas. It's time.

198
00:12:06,603 --> 00:12:08,903
You need to take perpendicular bites

199
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:11,292
about a millimeter apart.

200
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:16,276
How's it feel?

201
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:18,451
- Still tingling?
- It's fine.

202
00:12:18,576 --> 00:12:21,676
- I pretty much have full sensation.
- Great. Good.

203
00:12:25,624 --> 00:12:27,299
Have you... I mean,

204
00:12:28,027 --> 00:12:31,577
you think you could ask her
how long she's planning to stay?

205
00:12:33,177 --> 00:12:35,824
Mark, it's been a month,
and you've exchanged

206
00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:38,888
3 sentences with her.
2 of them were, "pass the cereal".

207
00:12:39,013 --> 00:12:42,613
In the spirit of the holiday,
maybe you can ask her yourself.

208
00:12:42,738 --> 00:12:45,347
She's pretty easy to like once
you get to know her.

209
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,688
No. She's a vapid, vapid girl,

210
00:12:49,813 --> 00:12:52,519
but she's your daughter, okay?
So try.

211
00:12:53,223 --> 00:12:55,289
Okay?
Try to be her dad.

212
00:13:06,302 --> 00:13:08,453
What are you looking at,
you old perv?

213
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,461
Merry Christmas.

214
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,048
Your mother sent me.

215
00:13:21,193 --> 00:13:23,051
- You heard.
- Your cousin said something

216
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,455
to her husband
in front of your niece,

217
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,390
who said something to your
younger niece, who said something

218
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:29,808
to your mother.

219
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:35,200
I was planning to put a tree up,
I just...

220
00:13:35,325 --> 00:13:38,586
- and where's Tuck?
- He's back east with Tucker's family.

221
00:13:38,711 --> 00:13:41,111
- He was with me for thanksgiving.
- So it's true.

222
00:13:41,699 --> 00:13:43,113
You are getting a divorce.

223
00:13:48,318 --> 00:13:49,327
It's weird.

224
00:13:51,004 --> 00:13:52,154
No heartbeat.

225
00:13:53,896 --> 00:13:55,893
I used to climb mountains, you know?

226
00:13:56,018 --> 00:13:57,988
One time I did the Inca trail.

227
00:13:58,113 --> 00:14:00,431
It's four mountains in three days.

228
00:14:00,556 --> 00:14:02,756
The second day there's this climb.

229
00:14:02,881 --> 00:14:04,509
It's eight hours straight.

230
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,575
And you are so tired,

231
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,681
and the air is so thin,
you don't even talk.

232
00:14:10,597 --> 00:14:12,297
All you do is climb. And

233
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:14,560
it's just you and

234
00:14:14,926 --> 00:14:16,326
your breathing and

235
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:19,024
your heartbeat
pounding in your ears.

236
00:14:19,367 --> 00:14:22,117
It's just hard
getting used to no heartbeat.

237
00:14:25,374 --> 00:14:26,974
And I'm getting tired.

238
00:14:31,074 --> 00:14:32,162
Really tired.

239
00:14:32,623 --> 00:14:33,623
I know.

240
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,262
You know what? You just need
to hang on till new year's eve.

241
00:14:37,387 --> 00:14:39,853
There's a lot of drunk drivers,
a lot of brain death.

242
00:14:39,978 --> 00:14:41,578
It's an organ-palooza.

243
00:14:45,954 --> 00:14:47,719
You just gotta hang on, okay?

244
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:50,096
You'll hike again, you know?

245
00:14:51,532 --> 00:14:52,682
We'll hike together.

246
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,814
It's such a beautiful world
outside of this hospital.

247
00:14:55,939 --> 00:14:57,255
It's snowy...

248
00:14:58,124 --> 00:14:59,224
and quiet...

249
00:14:59,585 --> 00:15:00,585
Cold...

250
00:15:01,622 --> 00:15:02,722
and perfect.

251
00:15:04,413 --> 00:15:06,947
So, you know, you just gotta
make it until new year's eve.

252
00:15:09,662 --> 00:15:10,951
I need to go outside.

253
00:15:11,633 --> 00:15:12,633
What?

254
00:15:14,102 --> 00:15:17,082
I might die. We all know that.
I might die really soon.

255
00:15:17,761 --> 00:15:21,365
But snow is my favorite thing
in the whole wide world.

256
00:15:22,569 --> 00:15:24,219
It's my favorite thing.

257
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:26,892
Please.

258
00:15:28,014 --> 00:15:29,164
Please, okay?

259
00:15:29,883 --> 00:15:31,805
- I'm sorry, but...
- We can do that.

260
00:15:36,825 --> 00:15:38,019
We can do that.

261
00:15:41,288 --> 00:15:44,038
I want to bolt. I want to quit.
I want to...

262
00:15:44,593 --> 00:15:46,193
go back to New York or

263
00:15:47,325 --> 00:15:48,792
I don't know... Arkansas...

264
00:15:48,917 --> 00:15:50,991
somewhere no one can come
looking for me.

265
00:15:51,508 --> 00:15:53,218
I don't know how to talk to her.

266
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,328
And I don't know
what she wants from me.

267
00:15:55,785 --> 00:15:57,535
It's the guilt, you know?

268
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:01,156
It's like every time
I look at her, it just...

269
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,356
The guilt is like
a punch in the gut every day.

270
00:16:04,481 --> 00:16:06,590
You shouldn't feel guilty.
You didn't know.

271
00:16:08,632 --> 00:16:09,634
I did know.

272
00:16:10,972 --> 00:16:13,122
I knew when her mom got pregnant.

273
00:16:13,928 --> 00:16:14,931
She told me.

274
00:16:15,636 --> 00:16:18,886
I gave her a couple hundred bucks and
I left town, and I never saw her again.

275
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:21,011
I figured she got an abortion.

276
00:16:21,863 --> 00:16:22,863
Hoped.

277
00:16:24,736 --> 00:16:25,986
But I did know.

278
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,114
You're a different guy now.

279
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,032
You're not 18 anymore.
You've grown-up.

280
00:16:33,345 --> 00:16:35,091
You're capable of better.

281
00:16:35,593 --> 00:16:37,874
Nicholas is back in the ER.
He's got a nosebleed, bad.

282
00:16:37,999 --> 00:16:41,082
- I've been trying stop it for an hour.
- We can't operate. We're not ready.

283
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,929
Then I'll admit him
and keep transfusing

284
00:16:43,054 --> 00:16:46,554
until the equipment's done,
which is gonna be soon, I hope?

285
00:16:53,256 --> 00:16:55,561
Are you Bailey's...
or I mean, Miranda's dad?

286
00:16:55,686 --> 00:16:58,086
William Bailey.
You can call me Bill.

287
00:17:00,772 --> 00:17:03,034
I'm Callie Torres.
I'm a-a friend of Bailey's.

288
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:06,392
She mentioned that she snuck you
in here. Said I should come say hi.

289
00:17:06,517 --> 00:17:08,967
So what's that she's doing
down there?

290
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,471
That's a hernia repair. We get
a lot of hernias at Christmas.

291
00:17:12,596 --> 00:17:14,988
Lots of people lifting trees or

292
00:17:15,113 --> 00:17:16,360
heavy gifts or

293
00:17:16,808 --> 00:17:18,287
santa bags. It's...

294
00:17:18,944 --> 00:17:21,581
We get a lot of broken bones, too,
cause of the weather.

295
00:17:21,924 --> 00:17:23,874
I had this, this guy earlier.

296
00:17:23,999 --> 00:17:26,217
He got an electric shock
from some christmas lights.

297
00:17:26,342 --> 00:17:29,588
The shock was so big
that it broke both of his wrists.

298
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,005
Anyway, I'm dating women

299
00:17:33,418 --> 00:17:34,886
- and...
- I'm sorry?

300
00:17:37,785 --> 00:17:39,594
I've recently started dating women.

301
00:17:39,719 --> 00:17:42,843
And my family had a really
hard time accepting that,

302
00:17:42,968 --> 00:17:45,268
but, you know, we worked through it.

303
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,361
Bailey said that you're having
a hard time with her divorce,

304
00:17:51,782 --> 00:17:54,948
which I totally understand.
But I...

305
00:17:56,266 --> 00:17:57,525
I wanted to say that

306
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:00,250
she didn't come
to that decision lightly.

307
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:03,035
And she's a good person, and...

308
00:18:04,885 --> 00:18:06,185
Merry christmas.

309
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:12,240
Did Hunt ever tell you about the time
that he made snow?

310
00:18:12,668 --> 00:18:14,753
His guys were feeling
the holidays pretty bad,

311
00:18:14,878 --> 00:18:18,278
so Hunt orders one of those
snow makers on christmas eve.

312
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,687
He tries to get the thing going,

313
00:18:20,812 --> 00:18:23,645
but the minute that the snow
hit the sand, it melts.

314
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,409
So Hunt blindfolded his guys

315
00:18:26,534 --> 00:18:30,005
and made them put their faces
right up to the snowblower.

316
00:18:31,302 --> 00:18:33,752
There was this one kid
from Minnesota.

317
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:38,231
He actually cried. He said it felt
exactly like christmas at home.

318
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,525
Hunt's so delicious when
he's tending to bloody soldiers.

319
00:18:49,861 --> 00:18:52,464
- Love me some Hunt.
- Shut up. What are you...

320
00:18:56,547 --> 00:18:58,312
So how was the view?

321
00:19:01,956 --> 00:19:03,775
I have been a proud father.

322
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,939
Your whole life,
I have been a proud father.

323
00:19:07,661 --> 00:19:09,361
Your mother and I sat in

324
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:11,870
the front row of every dance class,

325
00:19:12,262 --> 00:19:13,846
every oboe recital,

326
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:17,812
and we cheered. We sat in
the front row of every graduation.

327
00:19:17,937 --> 00:19:20,014
I was always the first one
on my feet

328
00:19:20,139 --> 00:19:22,254
and the loudest one in the crowd.

329
00:19:22,379 --> 00:19:26,089
I have been...
A proud father.

330
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,476
And today, Miranda, I

331
00:19:30,096 --> 00:19:31,805
sat in the gallery, and I

332
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:34,832
watched you repair
some fat man's hernia.

333
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,600
And for the first time in my life,

334
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,526
I felt ashamed of you.

335
00:19:41,697 --> 00:19:43,942
This is what you do on christmas?

336
00:19:44,627 --> 00:19:46,937
For this, you traded your husband?

337
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:50,688
For this, you traded
your child's family?

338
00:19:51,736 --> 00:19:53,442
So you could work all day

339
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,420
and go home alone on christmas

340
00:19:55,545 --> 00:19:58,335
to an empty house
without even a tree.

341
00:20:00,852 --> 00:20:02,802
I have been a proud father...

342
00:20:05,884 --> 00:20:08,013
But I would be a bad father today

343
00:20:08,138 --> 00:20:09,906
if I didn't look you in the eye

344
00:20:10,031 --> 00:20:11,581
and tell you that you

345
00:20:11,718 --> 00:20:13,668
have made a terrible mistake.

346
00:20:15,652 --> 00:20:17,252
You broke your family.

347
00:20:17,952 --> 00:20:20,169
You set your son up to fail.

348
00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:23,289
And the child I raised...

349
00:20:24,744 --> 00:20:26,844
she was raised better than that.

350
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,040
Well, that's something
you don't see every day.

351
00:20:42,165 --> 00:20:44,620
She could code.
The monitor could short out.

352
00:20:44,745 --> 00:20:47,517
Teddy's a brilliant surgeon, but
I don't get how she made this call.

353
00:20:47,642 --> 00:20:49,542
I get it. It's patient care.

354
00:20:50,029 --> 00:20:52,929
And Teddy's always been
a sucker for christmas.

355
00:21:14,349 --> 00:21:15,799
Oh, my God. Kelsey!

356
00:21:18,033 --> 00:21:20,152
From your x-rays and C.T.,

357
00:21:20,277 --> 00:21:22,490
it looks like part of
your bowel has died.

358
00:21:22,895 --> 00:21:25,241
It's a side effect
of your poor circulation.

359
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,200
- It's why you collapsed.
- But just...

360
00:21:28,144 --> 00:21:29,538
Fix her, okay?

361
00:21:30,075 --> 00:21:31,873
She can't have come this far to...

362
00:21:32,965 --> 00:21:34,115
Just fix her.

363
00:21:38,222 --> 00:21:40,465
We're gonna need to repair
this as soon as possible.

364
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,435
The more time we wait,
the more bowel dies.

365
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,511
But how? She's septic, hypotensive,
and she has no heart.

366
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,949
Her pressure's too low
for general anesthesia.

367
00:21:48,074 --> 00:21:49,474
She won't survive.

368
00:21:50,723 --> 00:21:51,723
Then...

369
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,271
We won't put her under general.

370
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:57,535
And this goes through the nose

371
00:21:57,821 --> 00:22:00,342
to the base of the skull,
and then I drill the bone off.

372
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,021
What happens
once you drill the holes?

373
00:22:03,146 --> 00:22:05,080
We put miniature
staple clips on the vessels.

374
00:22:05,205 --> 00:22:07,325
- With what instrument?
- We don't have it.

375
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:09,619
- Not yet.
- But we will. We will.

376
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:12,664
We're still trying to figure out
how to build it, but we're on it.

377
00:22:15,828 --> 00:22:19,003
I would like an invitation to your home
for christmas dinner.

378
00:22:19,709 --> 00:22:23,106
I know it's very late for me
to be asking for such an invitation,

379
00:22:23,231 --> 00:22:25,093
given that it is, in fact,
christmas day.

380
00:22:25,394 --> 00:22:28,065
However, I have
a very worried father,

381
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:31,265
and if I don't look like
I have some sort of life,

382
00:22:31,602 --> 00:22:32,738
he'll never leave.

383
00:22:32,863 --> 00:22:35,563
I have a bowel infarction
to repair, and then after that,

384
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,814
I'll be free to come to your home.

385
00:22:38,422 --> 00:22:40,045
- Sounds fine.
- Oh, absolutely.

386
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:41,175
Thank you.

387
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,463
The Chief just cut off
the funding for our equipment.

388
00:22:43,588 --> 00:22:44,588
What?

389
00:22:44,713 --> 00:22:47,234
We're way over budget,
and Nicholas is running out of time.

390
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:49,994
We want our bonuses to go towards
finishing the prototype

391
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,778
for Nicholas Jacobsen.

392
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:53,287
Sorry. You can't do that.

393
00:22:53,412 --> 00:22:55,832
- But it'll be like a donation.
- They're our bonuses.

394
00:22:59,585 --> 00:23:02,755
There are no bonuses.
That's what he's trying to say.

395
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:05,573
There are no bonuses
this year. I'm sorry.

396
00:23:07,374 --> 00:23:08,776
Merry christmas.

397
00:23:14,361 --> 00:23:16,361
I'll write a check.
How much?

398
00:23:20,568 --> 00:23:22,525
- I'll split it with you.
- Thank you.

399
00:23:26,552 --> 00:23:28,834
I have a teenager. What if she wants
to go to college?

400
00:23:28,959 --> 00:23:30,172
Have you met her?

401
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,030
Fine, I'm in.

402
00:23:32,305 --> 00:23:34,495
Thank you. I'll get back to
you with numbers. Shep.

403
00:23:35,236 --> 00:23:36,247
Chief.

404
00:23:38,816 --> 00:23:40,752
I'm sorry I tried to fire you.

405
00:23:41,734 --> 00:23:44,104
And in the spirit
of the holidays, I was...

406
00:23:45,703 --> 00:23:46,716
Sorry.

407
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:30,643
You're not serious. You got him
a snow globe of Seattle?

408
00:24:30,768 --> 00:24:32,259
What? He likes seattle.

409
00:24:32,552 --> 00:24:34,705
I gave you 50 bucks.
Where's my change?

410
00:24:38,231 --> 00:24:39,637
Your kids are bickering.

411
00:24:41,562 --> 00:24:42,935
Have you talked to her yet?

412
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,466
I'm workin' on it.

413
00:24:47,226 --> 00:24:49,221
Your sister's got
a ready-made family there.

414
00:24:50,445 --> 00:24:53,899
Don't worry. She didn't forget
about you. She invited you, right?

415
00:24:56,896 --> 00:24:58,033
He's drinking...

416
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:00,508
isn't he? Richard.

417
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,917
He's off the wagon.

418
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,463
He's drinking eggnog.
It's christmas.

419
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:08,415
Everybody drinks eggnog
at christmas.

420
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,705
Some people do.
Recovering alcoholics don't.

421
00:25:13,238 --> 00:25:16,097
He's not an alcoholic.
That was a misdiagnosis.

422
00:25:17,751 --> 00:25:19,392
Is that what he's telling you?

423
00:25:20,762 --> 00:25:23,472
Meredith, he is a surgeon
and he is drinking,

424
00:25:23,879 --> 00:25:25,424
and he is an alcoholic.

425
00:25:25,875 --> 00:25:28,234
That could quickly
become catastrophic.

426
00:25:30,517 --> 00:25:32,205
Were you drinking when I was a kid,

427
00:25:33,249 --> 00:25:35,269
when you left me with my mother

428
00:25:35,394 --> 00:25:38,194
and got another family
and never looked back?

429
00:25:43,803 --> 00:25:46,614
No, I didn't start drinking
till much later.

430
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,067
Then we can't blame the world's evils
on alcohol, can we?

431
00:26:04,833 --> 00:26:06,689
- It hurts.
- I know.

432
00:26:06,928 --> 00:26:09,978
Surgery with only a local
anesthetic is not ideal.

433
00:26:10,633 --> 00:26:12,142
Hang in there.

434
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:14,789
Okay, okay.

435
00:26:15,684 --> 00:26:16,799
It's gonna be okay.

436
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,942
I'm here with you, all right?

437
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:22,663
Hey, no tears.

438
00:26:22,892 --> 00:26:24,566
No tears at christmas.

439
00:26:24,845 --> 00:26:28,206
No, there's only, lights and,

440
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,510
snowmen... And songs.

441
00:26:41,415 --> 00:26:42,515
Come on now.

442
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:47,390
No, thanks.

443
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:50,579
- Sing, Yang.
- No. I don't... I'm jewish.

444
00:26:50,704 --> 00:26:54,304
Don't play the race card with me.
Sing or get off my service.

445
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:07,925
You, too, Karev.

446
00:27:19,455 --> 00:27:21,607
- The house looks beautiful, Mer.
- Thank you.

447
00:27:22,108 --> 00:27:23,231
Callie?

448
00:27:23,434 --> 00:27:25,202
- Working.
- That's too bad.

449
00:27:25,327 --> 00:27:28,229
- Here, you want some stuffing?
- Thanks.

450
00:27:28,804 --> 00:27:30,731
- That's all, thank you.
- How'd Kelsey do?

451
00:27:30,985 --> 00:27:32,641
- Well.
- Who's Kelsey?

452
00:27:32,766 --> 00:27:34,316
A girl with no heart.

453
00:27:34,441 --> 00:27:37,612
I had to do a laparoscopic
bowel repair

454
00:27:37,737 --> 00:27:40,440
while the poor thing
was awake on the table.

455
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:42,865
Miranda, mind your manners.

456
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,691
Even if surgery is your
whole life, it doesn't mean

457
00:27:45,816 --> 00:27:49,395
you have to talk about bowels
at the dinner table.

458
00:28:00,938 --> 00:28:02,438
My child is healthy.

459
00:28:04,929 --> 00:28:05,929
Excuse me?

460
00:28:06,981 --> 00:28:10,646
He may not be with me tonight,
but he's healthy...

461
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,732
- I didn't say he...
- and he's well-loved.

462
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,526
He's a well-loved boy.
And he's a happy boy.

463
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:18,404
And staying in
an unhappy marriage...

464
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:21,342
- now is not the time or the place
- staying in an unhappy marriage,

465
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:24,153
a marriage that I've outgrown,

466
00:28:24,278 --> 00:28:26,946
a marriage full of ultimatums

467
00:28:27,071 --> 00:28:29,832
and numbness and resentment...

468
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,409
that is not the kind of life

469
00:28:32,534 --> 00:28:34,837
I want to model for my child.

470
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,170
That is not

471
00:28:37,137 --> 00:28:40,972
what I want him to believe
married love is.

472
00:28:42,244 --> 00:28:44,304
Look, I know what's possible.

473
00:28:44,429 --> 00:28:46,020
I know what's out there for me

474
00:28:46,145 --> 00:28:48,100
because you taught me well.

475
00:28:48,551 --> 00:28:52,520
You and mom showed me
what true love looks like.

476
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:55,773
So I chose not to settle,
and I'm happier for it,

477
00:28:56,575 --> 00:28:58,625
even if I'm alone at christmas.

478
00:28:59,328 --> 00:29:02,425
My child is healthy, and I'm happy.

479
00:29:23,457 --> 00:29:25,781
And, you know,
part of my happiness is

480
00:29:25,906 --> 00:29:29,225
the fact that I got to repair
a woman's bowel

481
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:31,435
and save her life today.

482
00:29:31,753 --> 00:29:33,353
And that's God's work,

483
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:37,663
which makes this appropriate
christmas dinner conversation.

484
00:29:48,588 --> 00:29:49,588
I'm happy.

485
00:29:50,161 --> 00:29:51,706
And my child is healthy.

486
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:54,345
And that's enough for me today, dad.

487
00:29:55,403 --> 00:29:56,603
That's enough.

488
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,391
- Green beans, anyone?
- Thank you.

489
00:30:13,288 --> 00:30:14,288
Thanks.

490
00:30:25,856 --> 00:30:26,866
Okay

491
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:29,577
Here I would advise a one-hand tie.

492
00:30:37,422 --> 00:30:40,053
- Why don't I talk and you operate?
- Good.

493
00:30:41,484 --> 00:30:43,466
last night was my last drink.

494
00:30:43,959 --> 00:30:45,410
The shaking will stop soon.

495
00:30:45,535 --> 00:30:47,109
Good. Good for you.

496
00:30:47,442 --> 00:30:49,886
That doesn't mean I have to
quit drinking tequila, does it?

497
00:30:50,011 --> 00:30:51,702
Cause I really like tequila.

498
00:30:57,045 --> 00:30:58,967
- It's new year's eve.
- I know.

499
00:30:59,189 --> 00:31:02,651
She shows no signs of leaving...
no suitcase packed, nothing.

500
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:06,160
Talk to her right now,
or no more sex for you.

501
00:31:11,667 --> 00:31:12,667
So...

502
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,346
What you reading?

503
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:23,560
I can tell you don't really like me,

504
00:31:23,685 --> 00:31:26,206
and, your girlfriend's, like,
totally freaked out by me

505
00:31:26,331 --> 00:31:28,385
cause I'm kinda, like,
hotter than her.

506
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,203
But I'm pregnant.

507
00:31:32,256 --> 00:31:33,906
I'm having a baby, and,

508
00:31:34,609 --> 00:31:36,251
that's why I dropped out of school

509
00:31:36,376 --> 00:31:38,590
and that's why my mom kicked me out.

510
00:31:39,148 --> 00:31:40,148
Look...

511
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,885
I know you don't owe me anything...

512
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:46,362
But I can tell you guys
are about to kick me out...

513
00:31:46,778 --> 00:31:48,781
And I... I...

514
00:31:49,568 --> 00:31:51,718
I don't have anywhere else to go.

515
00:31:55,504 --> 00:31:56,504
It's okay.

516
00:31:57,921 --> 00:31:59,471
You're gonna be okay.

517
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:08,134
He's in hypovolemic shock.
He's lost too much blood.

518
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:11,024
I didn't want to have to do this,
but we're gonna have to put a tube

519
00:32:11,149 --> 00:32:13,870
down his throat to help him breathe.
We need to tube him right now.

520
00:32:13,995 --> 00:32:15,838
Don't tube him.
Bag him till we get to the OR

521
00:32:15,963 --> 00:32:17,733
- The OR?
- We finished the instruments.

522
00:32:17,858 --> 00:32:18,858
We did?

523
00:32:18,983 --> 00:32:21,433
We're gonna operate.
I just need you to sign a consent form.

524
00:32:21,558 --> 00:32:24,815
- Pretty dramatic timing, dr. Shepherd.
- I like to make an entrance.

525
00:32:25,631 --> 00:32:26,631
It's okay.

526
00:32:28,034 --> 00:32:29,765
Her kidneys are shutting down.

527
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:33,290
We need to find a donor.
We needed to find one yesterday.

528
00:32:37,812 --> 00:32:39,812
It's new year's eve, dr. Yang.

529
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,793
You said I just had to make it
to new year's eve.

530
00:32:44,676 --> 00:32:46,976
Drunks all over the roads.
So yeah.

531
00:32:48,243 --> 00:32:49,943
Tonight's are best shot.

532
00:33:00,576 --> 00:33:03,799
- How's it handling?
- It could bend a little more gently.

533
00:33:03,924 --> 00:33:06,066
Don't get all critical.
Thing cost me a fortune.

534
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:10,005
I could use one more day
to practice.

535
00:33:12,842 --> 00:33:14,692
Inserting the clip applier.

536
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:20,831
Why don't you try torquing it a little
to get a different angle?

537
00:33:23,609 --> 00:33:24,759
There you go.

538
00:33:26,412 --> 00:33:27,812
Okay. There it is.

539
00:33:27,937 --> 00:33:29,387
- Perfect.
- Okay.

540
00:33:44,502 --> 00:33:46,502
Got it.
That's the last clip.

541
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:50,653
- Oh, my God!
- Ladies and gentlemen, we're done here.

542
00:33:50,967 --> 00:33:52,926
- Nice work. Beautiful.
- Oh, my God. You did it.

543
00:33:53,051 --> 00:33:54,051
Amazing.

544
00:33:55,515 --> 00:33:57,365
Hang on. Look at the clock.

545
00:33:57,828 --> 00:33:59,778
And that's, seven, six...

546
00:34:00,357 --> 00:34:02,081
Five, four...

547
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,583
Three, two, one.

548
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:06,378
Happy new year!

549
00:34:07,254 --> 00:34:08,504
Happy new year.

550
00:34:09,368 --> 00:34:11,298
- Happy new year.
- Happy new year.

551
00:34:17,334 --> 00:34:19,056
I'm just gonna take a listen.

552
00:34:42,157 --> 00:34:43,920
It looks like we're hitting
the final wave

553
00:34:44,045 --> 00:34:46,299
- I need to talk to you.
- I'm headed to the...

554
00:34:46,557 --> 00:34:48,001
- what is wrong with you?
- You.

555
00:34:48,258 --> 00:34:50,127
- Me?
- Yeah, you. You come over here...

556
00:34:50,252 --> 00:34:52,559
- Why did you tell me this now?
- Why do you even care?

557
00:34:52,684 --> 00:34:55,910
You didn't say a thing all those times,
all those years... so why now?

558
00:34:56,035 --> 00:34:58,002
- I don't know.
- You don't know? I don't know.

559
00:34:58,127 --> 00:35:00,630
What does it matter to you?
You never felt the same way for

560
00:35:00,755 --> 00:35:02,055
of course I did!

561
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:07,396
Of course I did.
I had all those feelings for you

562
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:08,914
Teddy, for years,

563
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:11,859
- but you never gave me anything.
- You were engaged.

564
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:15,794
- You were engaged. You were engaged,
- You never gave me one damn hint!

565
00:35:15,919 --> 00:35:16,919
You idiot.

566
00:35:19,093 --> 00:35:21,952
I have loved you forever.

567
00:35:22,451 --> 00:35:24,829
I have loved you
when I was coupled up.

568
00:35:24,954 --> 00:35:26,746
I have loved you when I was single.

569
00:35:26,871 --> 00:35:30,135
I have loved you
every second of every day.

570
00:35:31,544 --> 00:35:33,744
I love you.
I'm in love with you.

571
00:35:39,832 --> 00:35:41,632
I'm in love with Cristina.

572
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,590
You paged me?

573
00:35:59,913 --> 00:36:02,572
I just confirmed, brain death
on an 18-year-old female

574
00:36:02,697 --> 00:36:05,252
involved in a head-on MVC.
Earlier this evening.

575
00:36:05,377 --> 00:36:07,623
She's a match for Kelsey.
So I called UNOS,

576
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:10,160
and they gave me the go-ahead
for a directed donation.

577
00:36:10,285 --> 00:36:14,106
Now dr. Bailey will do the organ
recovery, and I set up OR 2 for Kelsey.

578
00:36:14,231 --> 00:36:16,309
That is why new year's eve is
my favorite holiday.

579
00:36:16,434 --> 00:36:19,284
Stop it. This is not a celebration.
Come here.

580
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:24,196
No, no, no, not my baby.

581
00:36:24,321 --> 00:36:27,350
Please not my daughter.
Oh, my... I can't...

582
00:36:27,949 --> 00:36:29,749
This is not a celebration.

583
00:36:40,194 --> 00:36:43,304
Your kidney's have stabilized,
and your vitals are

584
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:46,508
stable, and...
Everything looks great.

585
00:36:48,632 --> 00:36:49,632
Feel.

586
00:36:52,565 --> 00:36:53,565
Awesome?

587
00:36:53,916 --> 00:36:56,448
I can only really feel your boob,
so...

588
00:36:57,806 --> 00:37:00,551
- You want to feel?
- No. But I will listen.

589
00:37:05,194 --> 00:37:07,933
- Oh, my God. What are you doing?
- Oh, my God. What are you doing?

590
00:37:08,058 --> 00:37:09,856
I know it's only been
a couple of months.

591
00:37:09,981 --> 00:37:13,239
And four dates. It's technically
been four dates.

592
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:15,649
You amaze me... every day.

593
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:17,501
And we went through a war together.

594
00:37:17,626 --> 00:37:20,282
We went through this together,
and we came out the other side.

595
00:37:20,589 --> 00:37:21,789
And I think...

596
00:37:22,177 --> 00:37:25,310
If we can get through this,
we can get through anything.

597
00:37:26,783 --> 00:37:29,422
So marry me. Please.

598
00:37:30,714 --> 00:37:32,014
Yes.
Of course.

599
00:37:58,947 --> 00:37:59,947
I'm...

600
00:38:02,328 --> 00:38:04,531
Insensitive sometimes.

601
00:38:07,676 --> 00:38:09,689
But I'm not oblivious.

602
00:38:10,001 --> 00:38:12,446
And I don't want you to,
to be with me

603
00:38:12,571 --> 00:38:15,042
because you feel like you
owe me something because...

604
00:38:15,321 --> 00:38:17,771
I mean, you two
went through war to...

605
00:38:24,217 --> 00:38:25,267
I'm with you.

606
00:38:25,841 --> 00:38:27,554
I'm with you because I want to be.

607
00:38:28,344 --> 00:38:30,888
I'm with you because I love you.

608
00:38:33,136 --> 00:38:34,286
Are you sure?

609
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:48,325
<i>Every day, we get to give
the gift of life.</i>

610
00:38:48,554 --> 00:38:51,495
<i>It can be painful,
it can be terrifying...</i>

611
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:55,364
<i>but in the end, it's worth it...</i>

612
00:38:57,445 --> 00:38:58,495
<i>every time.</i>

613
00:39:00,206 --> 00:39:02,506
<i>We all have the opportunity to give.</i>

614
00:39:04,046 --> 00:39:05,927
<i>Maybe the gifts are not as dramatic</i>

615
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,073
<i>as what happens
in the operating room.</i>

616
00:39:09,168 --> 00:39:12,399
So how was
new year's eve at Tucker's?

617
00:39:12,685 --> 00:39:13,985
Oh, it was fine.

618
00:39:14,744 --> 00:39:18,122
I kissed my grandson
at midnight east coast time,

619
00:39:18,247 --> 00:39:19,672
and I tucked him into bed.

620
00:39:20,646 --> 00:39:24,169
So you're headed home today?
Mom's picking you up at the airport?

621
00:39:26,607 --> 00:39:27,607
I...

622
00:39:29,282 --> 00:39:31,485
Tucked you in every night
of your childhood.

623
00:39:32,064 --> 00:39:35,289
I tucked you in
and I kissed you goodnight

624
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:38,307
and I checked under the bed
for bad guys.

625
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,530
And you went and grew up
and got yourself a divorce...

626
00:39:44,529 --> 00:39:46,479
And didn't bother to tell me.

627
00:39:50,578 --> 00:39:52,512
I didn't know how to...

628
00:39:53,131 --> 00:39:56,406
explain.
I didn't want to disappoint you.

629
00:39:56,531 --> 00:39:58,723
I didn't want to be judged.

630
00:39:58,848 --> 00:40:00,063
I'm your father.

631
00:40:01,483 --> 00:40:05,487
Can you imagine if little Tuck grew up
and got a divorce and didn't tell you?

632
00:40:14,041 --> 00:40:15,541
Then I'm sorry, dad.

633
00:40:16,765 --> 00:40:17,780
I'm so sorry.

634
00:40:17,905 --> 00:40:21,043
<i>Maybe the gift is to try
and make a simple apology.</i>

635
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:24,136
I'm... never judging you.

636
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,810
I'm worrying about you.

637
00:40:26,935 --> 00:40:29,135
Your mother and I worry about you.

638
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,310
That's all.

639
00:40:37,754 --> 00:40:39,255
Little Tuck,

640
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,209
he's a real spitfire, isn't he?

641
00:40:41,334 --> 00:40:43,509
- He is.
- He sure is.

642
00:40:45,111 --> 00:40:47,661
He doesn't seem
too much worse for wear.

643
00:40:52,498 --> 00:40:55,702
<i>Maybe it's to understand
another person's point of view.</i>

644
00:41:01,852 --> 00:41:04,562
Hi. I'm sorry that I paged you.

645
00:41:04,687 --> 00:41:06,386
He's pretty public here,

646
00:41:06,511 --> 00:41:09,103
and I know what that could do,
you know, to his career.

647
00:41:09,618 --> 00:41:11,618
I didn't know what else to do.

648
00:41:14,148 --> 00:41:16,748
<i>Maybe it's to hold a secret
for a friend.</i>

649
00:41:23,068 --> 00:41:25,893
<i>The joy, supposedly,
is in the giving.</i>

650
00:41:28,511 --> 00:41:29,761
Happy new year.

651
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:34,157
She is my star pupil, Joe.

652
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,575
My little star.

653
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,027
And I'm so proud of her.

654
00:41:38,674 --> 00:41:41,306
I am so very proud.

655
00:41:43,087 --> 00:41:45,085
She will be a brilliant surgeon...

656
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:47,854
brilliant...

657
00:41:48,951 --> 00:41:50,501
just like her mother.

658
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:53,184
<i>So when the joy is gone...</i>

659
00:41:53,621 --> 00:41:55,595
Get dr. Grey a drink, Joe.

660
00:41:55,875 --> 00:41:56,901
Tequila.

661
00:41:57,026 --> 00:41:59,236
<i>When the giving starts to feel
more like a burden...</i>

662
00:41:59,493 --> 00:42:00,680
<i>that's when you stop.</i>

663
00:42:00,805 --> 00:42:02,600
And... I will...

664
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:05,939
I'll have another club soda.

665
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,525
<i>But if you're like
most people I know...</i>

666
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:10,901
and it's on me... on me.

667
00:42:11,102 --> 00:42:12,852
<i>You give till it hurts...</i>

668
00:42:14,263 --> 00:42:16,163
<i>and then you give some more.</i>

669
