1
00:00:00,366 --> 00:00:02,507
<i>The problem
with being a resident is...</i>

2
00:00:02,957 --> 00:00:04,714
<i>You feel crazy all the time.</i>

3
00:00:07,296 --> 00:00:09,387
<i>You haven't slept in years.</i>

4
00:00:18,413 --> 00:00:21,399
<i>You spent every day around people
in massive crisis.</i>

5
00:00:22,745 --> 00:00:24,848
<i>You loose your ability
to judge what's normal.</i>

6
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:27,614
Will you crap off the floor
before this thing eats it?

7
00:00:27,774 --> 00:00:29,074
Okay, okay, okay.

8
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:33,365
<i>In yourself or anyone else.</i>

9
00:00:35,472 --> 00:00:38,824
<i>And yet people are constantly asking you
to tell them how they're doing.</i>

10
00:00:39,028 --> 00:00:40,775
<i>How the hell
are you supposed to know?</i>

11
00:00:40,895 --> 00:00:41,956
Eggs good?

12
00:00:44,739 --> 00:00:48,110
- The baby didn't like the breakfast.
- All right, into the can. Come on.

13
00:00:48,586 --> 00:00:50,807
<i>You don't even know
how you're doing.</i>

14
00:00:51,436 --> 00:00:53,373
We had our first
honest conversation

15
00:00:53,493 --> 00:00:55,378
about your feelings,
and now you want to leave.

16
00:00:55,498 --> 00:00:57,394
That timing doesn't strike you
as strange?

17
00:00:57,607 --> 00:00:59,396
No!
And I'm still firing you.

18
00:00:59,623 --> 00:01:01,606
- No, you're quitting.
- No, I'm not quitting.

19
00:01:01,766 --> 00:01:02,977
I don't quit things.

20
00:01:03,097 --> 00:01:04,423
Well, actually, you do.

21
00:01:04,602 --> 00:01:06,958
Your mother quit your father.
Your father quit you.

22
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,328
You quit your boyfriend. And if I read
your hospital chart correctly,

23
00:01:10,448 --> 00:01:12,779
you quit your life momentarily
on a couple of occasions.

24
00:01:12,899 --> 00:01:15,161
You quit.
It's what you know how to do.

25
00:01:15,801 --> 00:01:17,355
Now you're really fired.

26
00:01:19,953 --> 00:01:21,642
Now we're getting somewhere.

27
00:01:21,762 --> 00:01:23,605
And I want you to handle
all my consults.

28
00:01:23,725 --> 00:01:26,664
Anything you can do without me, do it.
And book some time in the robotics lab.

29
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:29,467
I want to give him a tour.
Hahn, Walter Tapley's coming in today.

30
00:01:29,627 --> 00:01:31,678
Do we have anything special
that he can scrub in on?

31
00:01:31,895 --> 00:01:35,098
- Walter Tapley is coming here?
- The chief was his student.

32
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:38,893
You studied
at the right hand of god? Wow.

33
00:01:39,053 --> 00:01:41,886
- We need something impressive.
- I will stab someone in the chest

34
00:01:42,006 --> 00:01:43,070
if I have to.

35
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:45,454
O'Malley,
get Boyer ready for his CT

36
00:01:45,574 --> 00:01:48,131
and prep my lap chole.
I need to be outta that OR by 10:00.

37
00:01:48,251 --> 00:01:49,944
Hahn, plan to be free at 10:00.

38
00:01:50,064 --> 00:01:52,028
O'Malley, did Patricia say
I had any messages?

39
00:01:52,148 --> 00:01:53,331
Yeah, she said...

40
00:01:54,643 --> 00:01:57,579
She said to tell you that your wife
hadn't called in the 20 minutes

41
00:01:57,739 --> 00:01:59,901
since you last asked
if your wife called.

42
00:02:00,182 --> 00:02:01,082
All right.

43
00:02:04,516 --> 00:02:06,873
I'm very optimistic
about this new viral cocktail.

44
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:09,409
Adding in I.L.-2 should make
a very big difference.

45
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:12,103
We're close. We're gonna open
this bottle of champagne soon.

46
00:02:12,223 --> 00:02:13,251
I know.

47
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,108
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

48
00:02:16,674 --> 00:02:18,658
Listen, clinical trials can be a grind.

49
00:02:19,085 --> 00:02:21,325
If this is getting to you,
I can do this one on my own.

50
00:02:21,445 --> 00:02:24,190
I'm not a quitter. I don't need you
to rescue me. Let's just do this.

51
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,692
<i>Because waiting is a bad idea.
I mean, we're talking about your health.</i>

52
00:02:27,852 --> 00:02:29,903
Dr. Shepherd can say no
if it's such a problem.

53
00:02:30,063 --> 00:02:31,417
What am I saying no to?

54
00:02:31,614 --> 00:02:34,936
If there any way you could
push back the surgery a few hour

55
00:02:35,056 --> 00:02:36,771
my boyfriend's flight was canceled.

56
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:38,495
- I want him to be here.
- Greta.

57
00:02:38,954 --> 00:02:40,400
He has some questions.

58
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:42,916
He's so smart about this stuff.
I don't even know what to ask.

59
00:02:43,076 --> 00:02:44,862
Are you reconsidering
the procedure?

60
00:02:45,097 --> 00:02:47,240
Andre and I have had
so little time together.

61
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,381
We met in january.
I mean...

62
00:02:49,707 --> 00:02:51,925
this treatment could kill me, right?

63
00:02:54,254 --> 00:02:56,523
You have a very aggressive tumor.
Even if we don't operate,

64
00:02:56,645 --> 00:02:59,546
- you're looking at a few months.
- But I'd spend them with Andre.

65
00:03:00,376 --> 00:03:02,179
Do you know
how precious that is,

66
00:03:02,312 --> 00:03:03,895
time with the person you love?

67
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,161
Greta, please.

68
00:03:05,281 --> 00:03:07,048
I'm not saying I want to cancel.

69
00:03:07,168 --> 00:03:09,356
I'm just saying
I want to wait for Andre.

70
00:03:09,478 --> 00:03:10,944
He'll help me to decide.

71
00:03:11,104 --> 00:03:13,780
- Okay, we can't wait for...
- He'll be here at 3:00.

72
00:03:19,863 --> 00:03:21,752
Dr. Mark Sloan.

73
00:03:22,064 --> 00:03:23,951
I used to be a patient of his.

74
00:03:24,597 --> 00:03:25,601
Rebecca?

75
00:03:26,486 --> 00:03:27,700
Where have you been?

76
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,834
Hi, Izzie.

77
00:03:29,052 --> 00:03:31,623
I've called you
and left, like, 50 messages.

78
00:03:31,743 --> 00:03:34,579
- You seem kind of upset.
- Well, you're not pregnant,

79
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:37,178
first of all, and Alex has been
turning his life upside down

80
00:03:37,338 --> 00:03:38,792
to be your baby daddy,

81
00:03:38,912 --> 00:03:40,875
and I can't tell him
because of confidentiality.

82
00:03:40,997 --> 00:03:43,727
- So yeah, upset.
- You can talk to Alex about anything.

83
00:03:43,887 --> 00:03:46,178
I want him involved.
And I am pregnant.

84
00:03:46,648 --> 00:03:48,235
- You kind of know.
- Okay.

85
00:03:48,367 --> 00:03:50,603
So if you're not trying to trap Alex
with a fake pregnancy,

86
00:03:50,723 --> 00:03:53,096
you won't mind
if I do another test, just to be sure.

87
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,554
Trap him?
Are you out of your mind?

88
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,633
I'm pregnant,
and that's a good thing

89
00:03:57,753 --> 00:03:59,909
because I want this baby.
I've always wanted a baby.

90
00:04:01,222 --> 00:04:02,329
You have a baby.

91
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,332
Of course I do.
I mean I want another one.

92
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,793
Do the stupid test again.
It'll be fine.

93
00:04:09,223 --> 00:04:11,379
And I need to see Dr. Sloan.
Can you help me with that?

94
00:04:12,193 --> 00:04:13,924
Yeah, I'll see what I can do.

95
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:16,524
- Dr. Shepherd.
- Yes.

96
00:04:18,308 --> 00:04:19,429
There's no Andre.

97
00:04:20,142 --> 00:04:22,682
- What?
- She made him up. He doesn't exist.

98
00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:26,186
My sister... She is not a woman
who has boyfriends, okay?

99
00:04:26,346 --> 00:04:28,707
And then four months ago,
she goes on a cruise,

100
00:04:28,827 --> 00:04:30,607
comes back saying
she's met her soul mate.

101
00:04:30,767 --> 00:04:32,632
Right around the time
her symptoms started?

102
00:04:32,752 --> 00:04:35,006
There were no pictures,
and nobody has ever seen him.

103
00:04:35,188 --> 00:04:36,529
Can you talk to her?

104
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:39,319
Can you tell her
we can't wait for Andre?

105
00:04:39,484 --> 00:04:41,534
'Cause we could be waiting
a long time.

106
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:47,222
- Is Tapley in there?
- No.

107
00:04:47,342 --> 00:04:48,685
- You're lying.
- yes.

108
00:04:50,619 --> 00:04:52,168
- Tapley in there?
- No.

109
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,708
- Liar.
- Yes.

110
00:04:54,241 --> 00:04:56,100
- Something is wrong with her.
- No, it's not.

111
00:04:56,222 --> 00:04:57,584
- I'm fine.
- She cleaned...

112
00:04:57,715 --> 00:04:59,892
Cleaned the apartment...
Which she has no idea how to do,

113
00:05:00,012 --> 00:05:02,305
- so she basically pushed dirt around.
- Leave her alone.

114
00:05:02,465 --> 00:05:04,259
Not everybody
has to be happy all the time.

115
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:06,268
That's not mental health.
That's crap.

116
00:05:06,428 --> 00:05:08,893
Walter Tapley's here,
and she doesn't want to meet him.

117
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,587
Well, that's... That's bad.

118
00:05:10,707 --> 00:05:12,957
You know, Torres,
mind your own business.

119
00:05:13,232 --> 00:05:15,568
You... You need to get help.
You're killing me.

120
00:05:16,615 --> 00:05:19,103
If you hang out until Hahn gets here,
you might get to meet Tapley.

121
00:05:19,244 --> 00:05:21,319
I don't give a damn
about Walter Tapley.

122
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:26,788
- Are you in the dark place?
- Yeah.

123
00:05:27,324 --> 00:05:28,394
Me, too.

124
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,004
There she is.
Dr. Erica Hahn, our chief

125
00:05:34,164 --> 00:05:35,425
of cardiothoracic surgery.

126
00:05:35,545 --> 00:05:37,555
It's an honor to meet you,
Dr. Tapley.

127
00:05:37,675 --> 00:05:40,343
I use your modified
bypass procedure all the time.

128
00:05:40,805 --> 00:05:42,959
Yeah. Well, that was
an afternoon well spent.

129
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,149
You came up with that
in an afternoon?

130
00:05:45,269 --> 00:05:46,642
It took him six years.

131
00:05:46,762 --> 00:05:48,237
You're a killjoy, Webber.

132
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,104
I didn't really come here
for a visit.

133
00:05:52,325 --> 00:05:54,524
I have aortic
and mitral stenosis

134
00:05:54,684 --> 00:05:56,234
with tricuspid regurge.

135
00:05:56,738 --> 00:05:58,528
I need
a double valve replacement

136
00:05:58,841 --> 00:06:00,322
and tricuspid repair.

137
00:06:01,858 --> 00:06:02,824
Are you sure?

138
00:06:05,357 --> 00:06:07,423
Charts, echos,

139
00:06:08,239 --> 00:06:10,415
Chest x-rays...
Everything you need.

140
00:06:11,341 --> 00:06:13,540
I may have invented
the modified bypass,

141
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,378
but I can't operate on myself.

142
00:06:16,274 --> 00:06:18,506
And my colleagues won't touch me

143
00:06:18,774 --> 00:06:21,676
because I have chronic a-fib,
pulmonary hypertension

144
00:06:21,836 --> 00:06:23,762
and a clot in my left atrium.

145
00:06:23,922 --> 00:06:26,640
They think if they operate,
they'll kill me.

146
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,809
What makes you think we'll do it
if your colleagues won't?

147
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,976
I didn't start their careers.

148
00:06:32,455 --> 00:06:33,939
They can say no to me.

149
00:06:34,806 --> 00:06:35,899
Webber can't.

150
00:06:42,059 --> 00:06:43,815
Transcript: www.swsub.com
Sync: Benj!

151
00:06:44,384 --> 00:06:45,575
Absolutely not.

152
00:06:45,735 --> 00:06:47,880
- Hold on. We haven't even...
- Have you read the file?

153
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,288
His pulmonary arterial pressure
is through the roof.

154
00:06:50,448 --> 00:06:53,139
- He's aware of the risk.
- Well, in that case, fine.

155
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:56,169
I don't know what I was so worried
about. I may go down in history

156
00:06:56,329 --> 00:06:58,023
as the surgeon
who killed Walter Tapley,

157
00:06:58,143 --> 00:06:59,965
but hey, at least
they're writing about me?

158
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:01,091
Erica, sit down.

159
00:07:04,646 --> 00:07:06,011
Let me tell you a story.

160
00:07:06,432 --> 00:07:08,948
- 38 years ago, when I was a young...
- I'm sorry. Is this gonna be

161
00:07:09,068 --> 00:07:11,434
a story about how you were
a struggling black med student

162
00:07:11,594 --> 00:07:14,291
who wanted to be a surgeon,
and no one would give you a chance,

163
00:07:14,411 --> 00:07:17,812
and Walter Tapley gave you that chance?
He mentored you, and without him,

164
00:07:17,932 --> 00:07:20,402
- you wouldnt be in this hospital today?
- Yes.

165
00:07:20,562 --> 00:07:22,779
I'm still not gonna operate on him.

166
00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:26,022
The sex... I thought
that was mind-blowing myself,

167
00:07:26,142 --> 00:07:28,149
but I get the impression
you had a really bad time.

168
00:07:28,269 --> 00:07:29,947
- What?
- Why are you avoiding me?

169
00:07:30,067 --> 00:07:31,948
I'm... I'm sorry.
I lost a patient.

170
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:34,892
- I'm not trying to avoid you.
- So not calling me after the sex

171
00:07:35,012 --> 00:07:37,284
- is you being a dedicated lifesaver?
- It is.

172
00:07:37,404 --> 00:07:38,784
So I'll see you later?

173
00:07:41,963 --> 00:07:43,091
You didn't call her?

174
00:07:43,345 --> 00:07:46,046
When was the last time
you called a woman after having sex?

175
00:07:46,422 --> 00:07:48,863
Yeah, well, that's gonna change.
I'm turning over a new leaf.

176
00:07:48,983 --> 00:07:51,213
What's wrong with the old leaf?
So they called you a whore?

177
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:52,437
You're a happy guy.

178
00:07:52,557 --> 00:07:54,495
Walter Tapley needs
a double valve replacement,

179
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,843
- and Hahn refuses to give it to him.
- What's her problem?

180
00:07:56,963 --> 00:07:58,757
- She thinks she'll kill him.
- Lightweight.

181
00:07:58,877 --> 00:08:00,482
Since when do surgeons turn me down?

182
00:08:00,602 --> 00:08:02,481
It's her choice.
She's the one opening him up.

183
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,152
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

184
00:08:04,522 --> 00:08:05,774
And another thing.

185
00:08:05,894 --> 00:08:08,204
If you spend the night with a woman
and call her the next day,

186
00:08:08,324 --> 00:08:10,765
and she doesn't call back,
does that mean she had a lousy time,

187
00:08:10,885 --> 00:08:13,235
or does that mean her answering machine
was consumed in a fire?

188
00:08:13,355 --> 00:08:16,234
- See, the chief calls the next day.
- You don't have to call her back.

189
00:08:16,723 --> 00:08:18,877
You just met this person.
It's new. It's fun.

190
00:08:19,057 --> 00:08:20,962
- It's casual.
- It's my wife.

191
00:08:22,123 --> 00:08:23,351
What, do I call again?

192
00:08:23,471 --> 00:08:25,140
No, another call looks desperate.

193
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,971
Send her an e-mail.
Invite her to dinner.

194
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:28,720
Just be casual.

195
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,263
- Confident.
- Sexy.

196
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,766
I mean romantic.

197
00:08:34,037 --> 00:08:35,060
Oh, O'Malley.

198
00:08:35,455 --> 00:08:36,460
Yes, sir.

199
00:08:36,623 --> 00:08:39,082
Tapley's in 2062.
He's getting an EKG and an echo.

200
00:08:39,202 --> 00:08:40,649
- I assigned Yang.
- All right.

201
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,159
Oh, one more thing.

202
00:08:44,704 --> 00:08:46,941
I know I said I wouldn't use you
to get my wife back,

203
00:08:47,061 --> 00:08:49,157
- but I am a desrate man.
- Okay, lay it on me.

204
00:08:49,317 --> 00:08:50,659
Draft an e-mail...

205
00:08:50,818 --> 00:08:52,619
Ask her to dinner.
No, no, don't ask her.

206
00:08:53,448 --> 00:08:55,163
Tell her.
She likes a strong hand.

207
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,034
You want me to ask your wife out
on a date with a strong hand.

208
00:08:58,154 --> 00:08:59,403
- Confident.
- Confident.

209
00:08:59,523 --> 00:09:00,919
Casual. Sexy.

210
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:02,080
Tell her...

211
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:06,633
Tell her the train is leaving
the station, and she better get on it.

212
00:09:09,954 --> 00:09:11,731
Can I talk to you about Rebecca?

213
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:12,680
Busy.

214
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,787
Alex, I gave her a pregnancy test
last week. She's not pregnant.

215
00:09:16,594 --> 00:09:18,562
- I wanted to tell you.
- You're telling me now.

216
00:09:18,682 --> 00:09:20,250
Alex, when I told her, she...

217
00:09:20,823 --> 00:09:22,140
She said I was wrong.

218
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,609
She thinks it's some sort of
false negative, whicit isn't.

219
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:27,069
She was puking this morning,
her boobs are all blown up.

220
00:09:27,189 --> 00:09:29,169
- I ran it twice.
- Labs are wrong all the time,

221
00:09:29,289 --> 00:09:30,699
and you're wrong all the time.

222
00:09:30,859 --> 00:09:33,743
How'bout you mind your own freakin
business and stay out of my life?

223
00:09:36,974 --> 00:09:39,050
You have my chart,
and I would prefer it if you didn't

224
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,167
because I fired you.
Can I have my chart, please?

225
00:09:41,327 --> 00:09:43,712
It's not appropriate to show up
at my door unannounced.

226
00:09:43,872 --> 00:09:45,297
You didn't fire me.
You quit.

227
00:09:45,457 --> 00:09:48,324
So if you would like to unquit,
make an appointment.

228
00:09:49,928 --> 00:09:50,942
You know...

229
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,342
Make an appointment, Grey.

230
00:09:54,462 --> 00:09:55,682
It's what we do.

231
00:10:02,075 --> 00:10:03,842
At the moment,
no surgery's been scheduled,

232
00:10:03,962 --> 00:10:06,659
so we need to focus on keeping him
stable and comfortable.

233
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:08,903
Anything he wants.
He wants a steak, kill a cow.

234
00:10:09,063 --> 00:10:11,352
Karev, bedside PFT's and an ABG.

235
00:10:11,472 --> 00:10:14,317
Yang, run a central line...
Sorry.

236
00:10:16,537 --> 00:10:19,159
Damn day care center pages me
every time he gets a runny nose.

237
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,000
O'Malley, go find out what they want.
I need Bailey focused on Tapley.

238
00:10:22,123 --> 00:10:23,814
- Go to the day care center?
- Quickly.

239
00:10:23,934 --> 00:10:25,297
Right man for the job.

240
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,216
Grey, Tapley needs a central line.

241
00:10:30,557 --> 00:10:32,469
- Do it.
- I don't understand.

242
00:10:34,035 --> 00:10:35,901
Take a needle, jab it
into his subclavian

243
00:10:36,021 --> 00:10:38,683
so he can receive medicine
and not croak... A central line.

244
00:10:38,843 --> 00:10:40,712
But I... I've...
I've never done one.

245
00:10:40,832 --> 00:10:41,857
Dr. Yang.

246
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:44,291
Hey. How'd it go with Greta?

247
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:46,678
- I haven't spoken to her yet.
- You haven't spoken to her?

248
00:10:46,798 --> 00:10:49,173
I already mixed the virus and the IL.-2.
We only have 6 hours.

249
00:10:49,293 --> 00:10:51,863
We're not gonna wait 6 hours.
We're gonna wait 3 hours.

250
00:10:52,141 --> 00:10:54,157
The guy we're waiting for doesn't exist.

251
00:10:54,467 --> 00:10:56,786
I want to give her a little
more time to enjoy him,

252
00:10:56,946 --> 00:10:58,845
or the idea of him
if nothing else.

253
00:10:58,965 --> 00:11:01,438
Because once we remove the tumor,
it's all gonna disappear.

254
00:11:01,558 --> 00:11:03,330
It's not real.
It's okay if it disappears.

255
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,307
- She can go back to her life.
- She was probably a lonely person.

256
00:11:06,435 --> 00:11:08,033
She found a way to have love.

257
00:11:08,153 --> 00:11:11,742
Of course she did because that's where
love exists, in delusional fantasies.

258
00:11:11,862 --> 00:11:13,593
Real love isn't like that.

259
00:11:14,726 --> 00:11:15,787
Good to know.

260
00:11:19,983 --> 00:11:23,329
- He punched someone named Harrison.
- You punched a child?

261
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,457
Apparently there was
a graham cracker involved.

262
00:11:25,577 --> 00:11:27,232
Over a graham cracker?!

263
00:11:27,392 --> 00:11:29,290
They said
they want you to talk to him.

264
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:31,868
Well, he's 14 months old.
What do they think i'm gonna do,

265
00:11:31,988 --> 00:11:34,281
give him a lecture
on nonviolent conflict resolution?

266
00:11:34,441 --> 00:11:35,532
I really don't know.

267
00:11:35,692 --> 00:11:38,535
Well...
My son punches other children.

268
00:11:38,897 --> 00:11:39,786
Perfect.

269
00:11:39,946 --> 00:11:41,575
Hey. Um, Dr. Yang...

270
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,903
who's even more evil than usual...
Asked me to do a cen...

271
00:11:44,023 --> 00:11:46,450
This is a big day. The kind
of day at could change things for me.

272
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:49,481
In there is Tapley,
and Tapley is god, right?

273
00:11:49,601 --> 00:11:51,756
I'm the chief's intern.
That makes me close to god,

274
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:55,054
which means I can't help you right now,
as unchristian as that may sound.

275
00:11:55,174 --> 00:11:57,443
You're right. I'll do
Walter Tapley's central line myself.

276
00:11:57,563 --> 00:11:59,302
So I puncture his lung?
He'll get over it.

277
00:11:59,422 --> 00:12:01,600
She wants you to do Tapley's line?
I'll do it.

278
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,312
Yay! Yay for Georgie!
Georgie saves the day.

279
00:12:05,817 --> 00:12:08,189
I give you Tapley,
and you pass it over to your intern?

280
00:12:08,349 --> 00:12:09,791
What the hell is wrong with you?

281
00:12:09,911 --> 00:12:11,918
Do you think
if you kiss the chief's ass

282
00:12:12,038 --> 00:12:14,491
enough by taking care of Tapley,
something magical's gonna happen?

283
00:12:14,811 --> 00:12:15,831
Like what,

284
00:12:15,951 --> 00:12:18,491
you'll earn your magical resident wings?
Oh, well, no.

285
00:12:19,224 --> 00:12:20,744
No. It's not gonna happen.

286
00:12:20,904 --> 00:12:23,566
You're stuck.
You are where you are.

287
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,938
The only way that you'd get
out of your miserable situation

288
00:12:26,058 --> 00:12:29,086
is if Burke were here.
Because you were Burke's guy.

289
00:12:29,246 --> 00:12:31,384
For some reason
he pitied your pathetic ass.

290
00:12:31,504 --> 00:12:32,823
But he's gone now.

291
00:12:33,326 --> 00:12:35,120
No wings for Georgie.

292
00:12:39,464 --> 00:12:41,348
Was I happy when I was with her?

293
00:12:41,941 --> 00:12:42,974
Off and on.

294
00:12:43,483 --> 00:12:45,018
I think I idealize it.

295
00:12:45,575 --> 00:12:47,392
I mean, you wouldn't hang on
to a woman who's

296
00:12:47,514 --> 00:12:49,242
unavailable, unpredictable, right?

297
00:12:49,634 --> 00:12:52,067
- You'd move on, keep it casual.
- Don't sell yourself short.

298
00:12:52,334 --> 00:12:54,736
Allow yourself to grow
with Rose...

299
00:12:54,896 --> 00:12:56,071
Share experiences,

300
00:12:56,231 --> 00:12:57,459
build memories.

301
00:12:58,304 --> 00:13:00,200
- Is this the new leaf?
- Yeah.

302
00:13:00,548 --> 00:13:01,712
Needs work.

303
00:13:02,502 --> 00:13:04,483
Oh, my god.
This is gonna kill me.

304
00:13:05,365 --> 00:13:06,346
Nice work.

305
00:13:06,468 --> 00:13:08,500
You found the subclavian
on the first try.

306
00:13:09,097 --> 00:13:10,807
Got yourself a good resident.

307
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:12,535
Actually, sir, I'm an intern.

308
00:13:12,655 --> 00:13:14,464
He's the best intern in the hospital.

309
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:16,549
O'Malley,

310
00:13:16,955 --> 00:13:19,796
start Dr. Tapley on a loading dose
of amiodarone,

311
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:22,267
- followed by a continuous infusion.
- Yes, sir.

312
00:13:22,387 --> 00:13:24,849
Why the hell would he
start me on amiodarone?

313
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:26,760
O'Leary, would you give amiodarone

314
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,521
to a man who's about to have
an open-heart procedure?

315
00:13:29,681 --> 00:13:31,805
George,
would you wait outside, please?

316
00:13:36,377 --> 00:13:39,030
If you can't get the head
of cardiothoracics

317
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,754
to do a valve replacement,

318
00:13:40,942 --> 00:13:43,076
then you're not the chief
I thought you were,

319
00:13:43,408 --> 00:13:46,311
and this is not the facility
I thought it was.

320
00:13:46,431 --> 00:13:48,957
So maybe it's better
for all of us

321
00:13:49,131 --> 00:13:50,750
if I don't get cut open here.

322
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:53,837
- Would you get these lines off me?
- Would you get back in that bed?

323
00:13:57,743 --> 00:13:59,077
I'll talk to her again.

324
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,487
You're not even gonna watch
the Walter Tapley surgery?

325
00:14:06,607 --> 00:14:09,990
I don't want five minutes with
Walter Tapley. I want five years.

326
00:14:10,187 --> 00:14:12,355
Tapley's a star maker.
That's why the chief's a star.

327
00:14:13,191 --> 00:14:15,358
Five minutes with Tapley
is a slap in the face.

328
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,550
It's like giving an alcoholic
a sip of wine.

329
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:20,238
Lexie's coming over. Let's try to keep
the carnage to a minimum.

330
00:14:22,504 --> 00:14:24,701
Can I talk to you
about something?

331
00:14:25,668 --> 00:14:26,953
Maybe some other time.

332
00:14:27,569 --> 00:14:28,747
Uh, but...

333
00:14:28,907 --> 00:14:30,940
Look, you know, she hates you.

334
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,906
Okay? She's not gonna say it
to your face

335
00:14:33,026 --> 00:14:35,420
'cause she's too polite,
but she thinks you're annoying.

336
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,889
And you showing up here
like the good little girl daddy

337
00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:40,817
didn't abandon is the worst thing
that's happened to her in months.

338
00:14:40,937 --> 00:14:43,185
And that's saying a lot
coming from Meredith Grey.

339
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,355
It's gonna be okay.

340
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,564
Wanna bet?

341
00:14:58,602 --> 00:15:00,964
Give me 2 minutes, i'll meet you
in the 3rd floor on call room.

342
00:15:01,084 --> 00:15:03,323
We're gonna sit
and enjoy a meal together.

343
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,736
- I don't get it.
- I've turned over a new leaf.

344
00:15:05,856 --> 00:15:08,787
From now on, if you want this,
you're gonna get this, too.

345
00:15:10,434 --> 00:15:11,623
Shove over, Sloan.

346
00:15:11,783 --> 00:15:14,434
Torres and I are gonna share
a sapphic salad.

347
00:15:14,778 --> 00:15:17,087
- Did I miss something?
- Yeah, we're lovers.

348
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:20,423
- Didn't you know?
- A love that dare not speak its name.

349
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:23,497
Look me in the eye, tell me you're not
thinking about a threesome.

350
00:15:23,617 --> 00:15:26,426
I'm not. The old Mark would,
but that's no more.

351
00:15:26,546 --> 00:15:28,306
Really?
You're not thinking about...

352
00:15:28,466 --> 00:15:29,897
her and me and you...

353
00:15:30,535 --> 00:15:32,028
And a video camera?

354
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,148
- Yeah, on call room, ten minutes.
- No.

355
00:15:38,475 --> 00:15:39,892
I am the chief of surgery.

356
00:15:40,012 --> 00:15:42,860
I am not killing Walter Tapley.
I don't care who you are.

357
00:15:43,091 --> 00:15:44,499
- Should I leave?
- No.

358
00:15:44,841 --> 00:15:46,366
He's dying anyhow.

359
00:15:46,621 --> 00:15:49,063
You'd rather see him die on
my watch than under your knife?

360
00:15:49,183 --> 00:15:50,403
- Yes.
- I should leave.

361
00:15:50,523 --> 00:15:52,715
I said no. Is there something
going on with all the women

362
00:15:52,835 --> 00:15:54,582
that when I speak,
they simply ignore it?

363
00:15:54,742 --> 00:15:57,246
You don't leave.
You review the file again.

364
00:15:57,388 --> 00:15:59,278
And if either of you see my wife,
you tell her

365
00:15:59,398 --> 00:16:01,756
the polite thing to do is return
a man's damn phone call.

366
00:16:05,945 --> 00:16:07,552
See, a tumor
in the temporal lobe

367
00:16:07,672 --> 00:16:10,849
can blur the line between
imagination and reality.

368
00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:13,602
It's possible that Andre
is part of that confusion.

369
00:16:17,531 --> 00:16:20,817
She likes being the succesul sister
with a husband and kids

370
00:16:20,977 --> 00:16:23,241
while I'm the single, pathetic one
who has to send

371
00:16:23,361 --> 00:16:25,196
herself flowers on Valentine's day.

372
00:16:25,814 --> 00:16:28,533
I found someone,
and she can't deal with it.

373
00:16:28,693 --> 00:16:31,322
- But there are no pictures of him.
- You want a picture?

374
00:16:33,582 --> 00:16:34,582
There.

375
00:16:34,965 --> 00:16:35,790
There.

376
00:16:36,085 --> 00:16:38,418
And there, and there.

377
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,504
But those are drawings
made from images in your head.

378
00:16:41,976 --> 00:16:44,673
- I'm an artist. That's what I do.
- What about the journal ad the writing?

379
00:16:44,793 --> 00:16:47,010
- Did you do a lot of that before?
- Leave her alone.

380
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:49,208
I didn't have anything
to write about before.

381
00:16:49,328 --> 00:16:51,918
Okay, it's just that there's a symom...
It's called hypergraphia...

382
00:16:52,038 --> 00:16:53,880
- It's compulsive writing.
- Leave her alone.

383
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,711
I'm in love with a man.

384
00:16:56,054 --> 00:16:57,812
I've touched him and held him.

385
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,971
He is not a figment
of my imagination.

386
00:17:00,091 --> 00:17:01,316
Tell them how you met.

387
00:17:02,068 --> 00:17:03,851
I was on a cruise
around the greek islands,

388
00:17:03,971 --> 00:17:05,705
and we had stopped at santorini,

389
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:08,456
and I was running to get back to
the ship, and my shoe fell off.

390
00:17:08,576 --> 00:17:11,201
And the horn was blowing,
so I didn't want to stop, so I left it.

391
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:14,146
That night at dinner,
Andre found me.

392
00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:16,068
He had my shoe.

393
00:17:16,675 --> 00:17:18,458
- Sound familiar?
- You're mocking me.

394
00:17:18,634 --> 00:17:20,851
No, I'm not.
I'm trying to make you see.

395
00:17:20,971 --> 00:17:23,672
Dr. Shepherd, does anything
about that sound familiar?

396
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,755
Sounds like <i>Cinderella</i>.

397
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,469
What else happened on the boat?

398
00:17:30,262 --> 00:17:32,535
- Greta?
- I had my first blackouts.

399
00:17:32,655 --> 00:17:34,255
Andre was there.
He carried me to...

400
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:37,090
A woman found you
on the floor of the bathroom.

401
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:40,095
- Prince charming didn't carry you...
- Get out! All of you, get out!

402
00:17:40,215 --> 00:17:41,904
This is a stupid, stupid...

403
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:46,486
Stupid conversation.

404
00:17:47,772 --> 00:17:50,240
Greta, the serum
that we use to kill the tumor,

405
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,535
- it only lasts a few hours. So...
- Is it going to expire by 3:00?

406
00:17:53,695 --> 00:17:54,828
No, it is not.

407
00:17:54,988 --> 00:17:56,819
- Dr. Shepherd...
- It is not.

408
00:17:58,941 --> 00:18:01,191
We can wait until 3:00.
We can't wait all day,

409
00:18:01,728 --> 00:18:03,408
but we can wait until 3:00.

410
00:18:09,557 --> 00:18:10,984
Hey, you. How's the...

411
00:18:17,392 --> 00:18:18,867
Some of my best work.

412
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,812
Any pulling
around the suture lines?

413
00:18:20,972 --> 00:18:22,080
No, it's perfect.

414
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,262
I'm just not sure
it goes with the body.

415
00:18:26,716 --> 00:18:27,899
See what I mean?

416
00:18:28,288 --> 00:18:29,571
Face is a head turner,

417
00:18:29,731 --> 00:18:32,110
but the boobs aren't stopping
anybody on the street.

418
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,660
You can close the gown.

419
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:38,370
It doesn't match.

420
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:40,642
It doesn't go with my face
and with my personality.

421
00:18:40,762 --> 00:18:43,201
- It's just all wrong.
- Didn't you tell me you were pregnant?

422
00:18:43,321 --> 00:18:45,182
- I can't operate...
- I don't need a lecture.

423
00:18:45,361 --> 00:18:47,436
I just need you
to finish what you started.

424
00:18:48,158 --> 00:18:49,379
Can you do that?

425
00:18:55,344 --> 00:18:57,417
- I need to talk to you.
- Make an appointment.

426
00:18:57,537 --> 00:19:01,019
I don't wanna make an appointment just
to get my chart back. Get it right now.

427
00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:03,021
I would like to go
to the bathroom in peace.

428
00:19:03,181 --> 00:19:05,125
It seems that everody's
dissatisfied here.

429
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:07,778
Where do you get off suggesting
that I'm a coward and a quitter?

430
00:19:07,898 --> 00:19:10,570
Are you trying to make me feel bad
about my life so that you can fix me?

431
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:13,990
- We can talk about it in therapy.
- No! I don't need therapy.

432
00:19:15,896 --> 00:19:17,535
- I forgive you.
- Lexie...

433
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:20,329
I forgive you. I forgive you
for treating me like crap,

434
00:19:20,449 --> 00:19:22,726
and I forgive you for letting your
friend treat me like crap.

435
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,011
I don't know how you get up
in the morning. I honestly don't.

436
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:27,641
Our dad abandoned you,

437
00:19:27,761 --> 00:19:30,331
and your mom, by all accounts,
was the meanest person ever,

438
00:19:30,451 --> 00:19:33,551
and you can't let Derek love you,
and it all really, really sucks.

439
00:19:33,763 --> 00:19:35,445
But ever since I knew you existed,

440
00:19:35,565 --> 00:19:37,472
I had this fantasy
about my big sister.

441
00:19:37,632 --> 00:19:39,893
And you have railed
on every occasion

442
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:41,434
to live up to that fantasy,

443
00:19:41,775 --> 00:19:43,144
but I still love you,

444
00:19:43,304 --> 00:19:45,605
whether you are capable
of letting me or not.

445
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:46,855
So...

446
00:19:47,349 --> 00:19:48,400
I forgive you.

447
00:19:51,224 --> 00:19:53,027
- 2:00 work for you?
- Yeah, okay.

448
00:19:53,196 --> 00:19:55,615
If this man dies under my knife,
richard, so help me,

449
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,738
I will tell every reporter
in the land

450
00:19:57,858 --> 00:19:59,577
that you insisted we do this.

451
00:19:59,737 --> 00:20:02,622
- You will look like an idiot.
- Relax. I'll be fine.

452
00:20:05,016 --> 00:20:06,793
She has impeccable judgment.

453
00:20:08,262 --> 00:20:11,089
And this may be the dumbest thing
I've ever done.

454
00:20:14,461 --> 00:20:17,153
Ted Ginsburg would've done this,

455
00:20:17,547 --> 00:20:18,730
but I wanted a friend.

456
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:21,510
In case I went into the OR.
And didn't come back,

457
00:20:22,345 --> 00:20:24,617
I wanted an old friend
to say good-bye.

458
00:20:28,007 --> 00:20:29,078
I'm honored.

459
00:20:29,341 --> 00:20:30,150
Don't be.

460
00:20:32,355 --> 00:20:33,810
I shoulda had a wife...

461
00:20:34,618 --> 00:20:35,989
And a bunch of kids...

462
00:20:37,511 --> 00:20:39,156
I wouldn't have to
track you down

463
00:20:39,276 --> 00:20:41,464
to get someone
to be at my deathbed.

464
00:20:45,689 --> 00:20:46,499
Stevens.

465
00:20:47,436 --> 00:20:49,473
What are you treating
Rebecca Pope for?

466
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,036
For a pregnancy she doesn't have,
but she thinks she does.

467
00:20:52,156 --> 00:20:53,981
Doesn't one of you
have science on your side?

468
00:20:54,101 --> 00:20:56,090
Yes. She is acting really weird.

469
00:20:56,236 --> 00:20:58,158
She wants breast
enhancement surgery.

470
00:20:58,278 --> 00:21:00,389
She thinks her new face
doesn't match her body.

471
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:03,155
We may be looking at acute stress
disorder. It happens when people

472
00:21:03,275 --> 00:21:05,870
have massive plastic surgeries
and major trauma like she did.

473
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:08,529
You look in the mirror, you don't see
the same person, you're not sure

474
00:21:08,649 --> 00:21:11,075
you are the same person.
It can lead to some pretty odd behavior.

475
00:21:11,195 --> 00:21:14,325
Like thinking you're pregnant when you
are not and forgetting you have a baby?

476
00:21:14,445 --> 00:21:16,363
Make it clear to her
that she's not pregnant.

477
00:21:16,523 --> 00:21:19,082
Then get her a psych consult,
then have psych call me.

478
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:21,995
Here you are, chief.

479
00:21:22,229 --> 00:21:23,828
No, read that...
Read that to me.

480
00:21:23,988 --> 00:21:25,872
I can't see anything
on that tiny screen.

481
00:21:26,032 --> 00:21:28,567
- Oh, no. That's a bad idea.
- Speak up, O'Malley.

482
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,417
"Dear Adele,

483
00:21:32,075 --> 00:21:33,171
"eat with me.

484
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,146
"The love train is leaving the station,

485
00:21:36,266 --> 00:21:38,015
"and you know
you want to take a ride...

486
00:21:38,135 --> 00:21:39,970
- O'Malley!
- "Take a ride..."

487
00:21:41,101 --> 00:21:43,930
With all due respect, sir, I didn't
come up with the train or the station.

488
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:46,393
- Give that to me. I'll do it myself.
- Yes, sir.

489
00:21:47,574 --> 00:21:49,632
Hey, so, um,
let me get this straight.

490
00:21:49,752 --> 00:21:53,409
If I wander into an on call room,
you are not gonna follow me?

491
00:21:53,718 --> 00:21:55,863
You ever think about why
you need sex all the time?

492
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:59,739
- Is it replacing something? Or are...
- I use it to clear my head. So...

493
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:01,828
On call room.

494
00:22:01,948 --> 00:22:04,411
We can sit in there and talk,
but we're not having sex.

495
00:22:04,571 --> 00:22:06,771
Why?
What are we gonna talk about?

496
00:22:06,891 --> 00:22:08,999
At lunch, you seemed to want
to talk about threesomes.

497
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:11,126
You are so not a new man.

498
00:22:11,286 --> 00:22:13,199
I mean, I guess
if you had to have a threesome,

499
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:15,471
Erica Hahn
wouldn't be a bad choice, right?

500
00:22:15,591 --> 00:22:17,173
I mean, she brings that whole

501
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:20,844
"We're naughty, and we're getting sent
to the principal's office" thing to it.

502
00:22:21,362 --> 00:22:24,303
You never thought about
reaching across the OR table

503
00:22:24,542 --> 00:22:28,014
and pulling down her mask,
ripping off her scrub cap

504
00:22:28,134 --> 00:22:31,730
so that you can grab a handful
of that blonde hair...

505
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:34,377
Stop.
Stop talking about Erica Hahn.

506
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:41,994
Everything all right?

507
00:22:42,114 --> 00:22:45,241
One of the founding fathers
of cardiothoracic surgery

508
00:22:45,361 --> 00:22:46,518
is on the table,

509
00:22:46,638 --> 00:22:49,456
and I am about to slice open his chest.
Give me a minute.

510
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:58,370
Don't screw it up.

511
00:23:00,154 --> 00:23:01,703
I'm gonna kill you.

512
00:23:03,817 --> 00:23:05,305
We've got this patient,

513
00:23:05,906 --> 00:23:07,724
and she's got true love.

514
00:23:07,884 --> 00:23:09,017
Do you wanna know why?

515
00:23:09,177 --> 00:23:11,185
Because her boyfriend
doesn't exist.

516
00:23:11,504 --> 00:23:13,757
Derek is all broken up over her,

517
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:16,936
Like it means something
that she's having an affair

518
00:23:17,056 --> 00:23:18,251
with a hallucination.

519
00:23:18,371 --> 00:23:21,363
But Derek wasn't ready to give up
on the relationship, and you were.

520
00:23:21,523 --> 00:23:23,798
No, I didn't give up.
I wanted to try again,

521
00:23:23,983 --> 00:23:25,533
and then he went and kissed rose.

522
00:23:25,795 --> 00:23:28,036
So he's the one
who messes up, not me.

523
00:23:28,196 --> 00:23:31,227
But it's a relationship.
People make mistakes.

524
00:23:31,387 --> 00:23:33,802
And you stand back,
waiting for him to fail

525
00:23:33,922 --> 00:23:35,710
so you can say,
"Aha! Now I quit."

526
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:37,316
No. It wasn't working.

527
00:23:37,497 --> 00:23:40,465
Was your life not working when you let
that slip out from under you?

528
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:43,131
Okay, when are you gonna
stop suggesting that I'm suicidal?

529
00:23:43,294 --> 00:23:45,921
When you start acting like
somebody that wants to be alive.

530
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:47,358
- Give me my chart.
- Why?

531
00:23:47,478 --> 00:23:50,048
Because I'm not suicidal, and
if it says that, then it's wrong.

532
00:23:50,168 --> 00:23:52,161
What happened last year
when you fell in the water?

533
00:23:52,281 --> 00:23:54,224
I almost drowned.
You think I did that for kicks?

534
00:23:54,344 --> 00:23:58,379
You put your hand in a body cavity
that contained unexploded ordnance.

535
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,942
I was trying to save a patient.

536
00:24:01,062 --> 00:24:03,402
Why is it that every other person
in that room

537
00:24:03,522 --> 00:24:05,198
had the sense to hit the deck?

538
00:24:05,966 --> 00:24:09,327
You know, people run away from
this line between life and death.

539
00:24:09,487 --> 00:24:12,525
You seem to stand on it
and wait for a strong wind

540
00:24:12,645 --> 00:24:14,457
to sway you one way
or the other.

541
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:17,879
You're careless with your life.

542
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:20,387
You're not slitting your wrists,
but you're careless,

543
00:24:20,507 --> 00:24:22,353
probably because your mother
told you you were

544
00:24:22,473 --> 00:24:25,677
a waste of space on this planet.
The problem is, you believed her.

545
00:24:26,103 --> 00:24:29,343
If you don't watch out one of these days
you're gonna die because of it.

546
00:24:32,807 --> 00:24:34,894
Hand me my chart.

547
00:24:36,736 --> 00:24:37,689
Now!

548
00:24:45,433 --> 00:24:47,687
And don't ever talk about
my mother again.

549
00:24:50,034 --> 00:24:52,370
There's a leak.
Go back on bypass now.

550
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:54,873
Bailey, take the clamps off
of the aortic and venous lines.

551
00:24:55,033 --> 00:24:57,669
- Grey, take the sucon.
- The whole left atrium is torn

552
00:24:57,789 --> 00:25:00,253
where that clot was adhered.
Metzenbaum scissors.

553
00:25:01,068 --> 00:25:03,632
This was a mistake.
It was irresponsible

554
00:25:03,792 --> 00:25:06,760
and stupid, and I cannot believe
that I let you talk me into it.

555
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,638
My reputation's gonna be
in the toilet at the end of this day.

556
00:25:09,798 --> 00:25:12,682
Dan slocum at mercy is gonna
have a field day with this,

557
00:25:12,842 --> 00:25:15,018
- condescending tool that he is.
- Erica...

558
00:25:15,178 --> 00:25:17,543
Don't rica" me, Richard.
It's not your good name

559
00:25:17,663 --> 00:25:20,233
we're gonna destroy here today,
much as I wish that it was.

560
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:21,433
Dr. Hahn,

561
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,387
it's done.

562
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:30,283
No leak.
The repair is holding.

563
00:25:31,184 --> 00:25:32,202
You were saying?

564
00:26:03,719 --> 00:26:05,071
Is that clock right?

565
00:26:06,081 --> 00:26:07,189
I'm sure it is.

566
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:13,116
Maybe his plane was delayedn

567
00:26:14,195 --> 00:26:16,913
maybe his phone is off
because he's still on the plane.

568
00:26:18,615 --> 00:26:19,798
He's coming.

569
00:26:29,356 --> 00:26:30,389
Here.

570
00:26:33,338 --> 00:26:34,690
My head did this?

571
00:26:36,277 --> 00:26:37,760
Your tumor did this.

572
00:26:42,358 --> 00:26:43,710
He was never there?

573
00:26:50,251 --> 00:26:51,415
Oh, god.

574
00:26:53,233 --> 00:26:54,453
Oh, god.

575
00:27:03,132 --> 00:27:05,019
How can he not be real?

576
00:27:07,498 --> 00:27:08,625
I'm sorry.

577
00:27:20,386 --> 00:27:21,534
Oh, god.

578
00:27:28,655 --> 00:27:30,362
Well, hey there, baby boy.

579
00:27:30,603 --> 00:27:32,739
You managed to make it
through the day, huh?

580
00:27:33,129 --> 00:27:37,257
Our son has been punching
other children.

581
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:39,829
- Yeah, I know.
- What you mean, you know?

582
00:27:39,989 --> 00:27:42,065
It's happened before.
I'm dealing with it.

583
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:46,658
Wait a minute. I had to bribe
the director of the day care center

584
00:27:46,778 --> 00:27:47,851
to get him back in.

585
00:27:47,971 --> 00:27:50,210
I had to promis
to bring apple slices

586
00:27:50,332 --> 00:27:52,034
and give free mammograms
to the teachers.

587
00:27:52,154 --> 00:27:54,511
Now why aren't you telling me
what's happening?

588
00:27:55,255 --> 00:27:58,431
I don't judge how you do surgery.
Don't judge how I deal with him.

589
00:27:58,591 --> 00:28:01,142
Obviously you didn't deal with it.
He's punching other children.

590
00:28:01,302 --> 00:28:03,937
Of course he's punching people.
He used to be with me all day,

591
00:28:04,097 --> 00:28:07,649
and now he's in day care so he can spend
ten minutes with you every three hours.

592
00:28:07,809 --> 00:28:09,985
- So that's just making him violent?
- Yes, he's got...

593
00:28:10,145 --> 00:28:11,389
Hey, Tuck. Hey.

594
00:28:11,509 --> 00:28:13,640
Hey, can I take him
to say hi for a minute?

595
00:28:14,441 --> 00:28:15,937
Uh, yeah, sure, sure.

596
00:28:16,057 --> 00:28:19,160
Yeah, you wanna go play
with the office supplies?

597
00:28:21,948 --> 00:28:25,348
Look, if you can't communicate
well enough to tell me...

598
00:28:25,468 --> 00:28:28,763
Don't lecture me, Miranda Bailey.
I'm not one of your students.

599
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:32,507
Now with all the time you spend here,
it's hard to differentiate sometimes.

600
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:36,864
No, I spend my time here
because I'm building a life for us!

601
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:39,389
I spend my time here
because I don't have the luxury

602
00:28:39,549 --> 00:28:42,228
of being able to take year off
and spend it with our child

603
00:28:42,348 --> 00:28:44,636
and knowing that my career
is gonna be there waiting for me

604
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:46,438
- when I'm ready to go back.
- A luxury?

605
00:28:46,598 --> 00:28:48,523
So you think spending all day
every day

606
00:28:48,683 --> 00:28:51,493
<i>wiping noses
and changing diapers is a luxury?</i>

607
00:28:52,103 --> 00:28:54,089
I think it's a beautiful thing
that you get to do!

608
00:28:54,209 --> 00:28:55,668
And you're taking it for granted!

609
00:28:55,788 --> 00:28:58,205
I take it for granted?
I take our family for granted?

610
00:28:58,325 --> 00:29:00,160
- I did not say...
- No, you did say.

611
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,120
<i>- You did say!
- I work because we...</i>

612
00:29:02,434 --> 00:29:05,081
- You love your work.
- And I love my family, too!

613
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:07,448
It is going to be okay.

614
00:29:08,809 --> 00:29:11,901
Uncle George says
it is going to be okay.

615
00:29:14,036 --> 00:29:16,423
This used to happen when I was a kid.
I'd get a strep test,

616
00:29:16,543 --> 00:29:17,886
and it'd come back negative.

617
00:29:18,471 --> 00:29:20,639
Look, okay, that's your uterus.

618
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,236
There is nothing in there.

619
00:29:22,675 --> 00:29:24,370
No fetus, no sack, nothing.

620
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:26,144
But it's too early. It's tiny.

621
00:29:26,304 --> 00:29:27,730
You can't see anything yet.

622
00:29:30,538 --> 00:29:33,026
- What the hell are you doing?
- I paged you 20 minutes ago.

623
00:29:34,881 --> 00:29:36,508
Rebecca, look.

624
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,475
Okay, this is a fetus at 6 weeks.

625
00:29:39,948 --> 00:29:42,821
All right, it's a tiny spot,
but it's there. You can see it.

626
00:29:43,185 --> 00:29:45,121
Look at your urus.
There's nothing there.

627
00:29:45,673 --> 00:29:46,677
Nothing.

628
00:29:47,317 --> 00:29:48,369
Get out.

629
00:29:51,037 --> 00:29:53,964
Here are her labs, and there's a chart
note from Dr. Sloan. I could get

630
00:29:54,124 --> 00:29:56,383
- a psych consult for you if you want.
- Just get out!

631
00:30:00,813 --> 00:30:01,638
What?

632
00:30:04,015 --> 00:30:05,187
There's no baby.

633
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,144
I lost the baby?

634
00:30:08,395 --> 00:30:09,896
No, you...
You weren't pregnant.

635
00:30:10,793 --> 00:30:13,817
If you had been pregnant, your beta
HCG level would have been elevated.

636
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:16,987
It's zero. You didn't miscarry.
There never was a baby.

637
00:30:21,525 --> 00:30:23,769
I can't believe I lost our baby.

638
00:30:24,195 --> 00:30:26,329
Rebecca, you're not hearing me.

639
00:30:26,489 --> 00:30:27,929
I'm so sorry.

640
00:30:29,196 --> 00:30:32,991
I'm so sorry I lost our baby.

641
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,351
Shh. It's okay.

642
00:30:39,348 --> 00:30:41,140
You're gonna be okay.
All right?

643
00:30:43,882 --> 00:30:45,816
Remember,
we need to stay in sync.

644
00:30:45,936 --> 00:30:47,017
Ready? Go.

645
00:30:48,338 --> 00:30:50,020
Good. Easy. Slow.
Slow down.

646
00:30:50,751 --> 00:30:53,023
Right there. Right there.
Good.

647
00:30:54,142 --> 00:30:56,292
Her pressure's rising.
She's getting bradycardic.

648
00:30:56,412 --> 00:30:59,262
Okay, so let's push 1 gram per kilo
of mannitol, 20 lasix.

649
00:30:59,382 --> 00:31:02,115
See if we can avoid
increased ICP.

650
00:31:10,312 --> 00:31:11,974
Is there a problem, Dr. Grey?

651
00:31:14,346 --> 00:31:15,520
Andre's here.

652
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,893
You run everywhere,

653
00:31:30,053 --> 00:31:31,958
or is it just
you're scared of me?

654
00:31:32,416 --> 00:31:34,145
I'm just trying to stay
on top of things.

655
00:31:34,265 --> 00:31:36,131
Well, you're doing a fine job.

656
00:31:36,251 --> 00:31:37,734
It's very impressive work.

657
00:31:41,685 --> 00:31:44,324
If you wouldn't mind mentioning
to the chief that you like my work...

658
00:31:44,484 --> 00:31:46,451
I was held back as an intern.

659
00:31:46,765 --> 00:31:48,173
There was some personal...

660
00:31:48,769 --> 00:31:50,290
Stuff. I'm good.

661
00:31:50,869 --> 00:31:53,010
And, uh, if you would
say something to him...

662
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:55,627
Webber would not have made
that decision likely.

663
00:31:57,084 --> 00:31:59,506
Learning is like healing,

664
00:32:00,078 --> 00:32:01,758
it happens over time.

665
00:32:05,433 --> 00:32:06,433
Listen...

666
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:08,065
Keep running.

667
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,989
But not because
you want to cut corners.

668
00:32:11,367 --> 00:32:13,283
Because it makes you
a better doctor.

669
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:16,439
You're not supposed to be talking.

670
00:32:16,806 --> 00:32:19,198
O'leary and I were just,
uh, marveling at the fact

671
00:32:19,318 --> 00:32:22,404
- that you haven't killed me yet.
- Well, there's always tomorrow.

672
00:32:23,298 --> 00:32:26,370
Check his post-op echo and make sure
there's no residual prolapse.

673
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:27,514
Yes, sir.

674
00:32:46,902 --> 00:32:48,972
- Are you okay?
- Don't ask me if I'm okay.

675
00:32:49,768 --> 00:32:50,782
Okay.

676
00:32:51,295 --> 00:32:54,060
You make me sick.
Have some fire.

677
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,643
Be unstoppable.
Be a force of nature.

678
00:32:56,947 --> 00:32:58,853
Be better than anyone here,

679
00:32:58,975 --> 00:33:00,702
and don't give a damn
what anyone thinks.

680
00:33:00,834 --> 00:33:03,519
There are no teams here,
no buddies.

681
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:06,698
You're on your own.
Be on your own.

682
00:33:12,429 --> 00:33:13,580
Dr. Yang...

683
00:33:14,129 --> 00:33:17,250
I just scrubbed in on Walter Tapley's
double valve replacement.

684
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:20,712
I watched Dr. Hahn excise
a piece of his pEricardium

685
00:33:20,872 --> 00:33:22,612
from, like, 3 inches away.

686
00:33:22,781 --> 00:33:25,504
That's what I got to do
while you made notes in charts.

687
00:33:26,142 --> 00:33:29,304
So whatever crap you want to
rain down on my head, go for it.

688
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:32,408
Because I just saw the inside
of Walter Tapley's heart,

689
00:33:32,615 --> 00:33:35,435
and that is something that
you will never take away from me.

690
00:33:39,132 --> 00:33:41,107
Yeah. Okay.

691
00:33:41,348 --> 00:33:42,475
Okay, then.

692
00:33:49,192 --> 00:33:52,243
Hey, Tuck. Here's Tapley's file.
The new labs are in there.

693
00:33:52,403 --> 00:33:53,745
Just put it on the pile.

694
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:56,903
- Tucker didn't take him
- I wanted the evening with him.

695
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,155
You guys get to the bottom
of anything?

696
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,894
Why don't I take Tuck
for a couple hours?

697
00:34:05,083 --> 00:34:06,925
You can go talk to him,
go fight with him.

698
00:34:07,085 --> 00:34:10,249
You're not gonna fix anything in one day
but you can go on and keep trying.

699
00:34:17,696 --> 00:34:18,768
What are you doing?

700
00:34:18,888 --> 00:34:21,431
I need some of your clothes.
She's staying for a couple of days.

701
00:34:21,551 --> 00:34:23,751
- She didn't bring enough stuff.
- You called her husband?

702
00:34:23,871 --> 00:34:26,492
- She doesn't want to talk to him.
- Did you get a psych consult?

703
00:34:26,612 --> 00:34:28,086
Alex, hey!

704
00:34:28,565 --> 00:34:31,491
She had a hysterical pregnancy.
Sloan thinks she may have a stress d...

705
00:34:31,651 --> 00:34:33,242
She's fine, okay?
I can handle it.

706
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:36,162
I'm gonna take care of her.
Just give me some damn girl clothes.

707
00:34:50,914 --> 00:34:52,229
That's better, right?

708
00:34:55,205 --> 00:34:56,474
There you go.

709
00:35:00,472 --> 00:35:02,480
Tomorrow's board
and Dr. Tapley's echo.

710
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,982
Hahn is seeing him now.

711
00:35:04,142 --> 00:35:06,296
What are you doing
with Bailey's child?

712
00:35:07,745 --> 00:35:09,112
Dr. Bailey and I are in love,

713
00:35:09,272 --> 00:35:11,031
and I'll be heading back
to Vegas with her

714
00:35:11,191 --> 00:35:13,312
as soon as my divorce
from Dr. Torres is final.

715
00:35:14,273 --> 00:35:15,744
We need to write Adele again.

716
00:35:15,904 --> 00:35:18,434
She replied to my e-mail,
but all she sent was a typo.

717
00:35:18,554 --> 00:35:20,540
She's no better at this
than I am. Here.

718
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:22,675
That's not a typo, sir. That's a wink.

719
00:35:22,795 --> 00:35:25,086
No, that's a semicolon
and close parentheses.

720
00:35:25,246 --> 00:35:26,546
Turn it sideways.

721
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:30,508
- What the hell does this mean?
- She's flirting.

722
00:35:32,167 --> 00:35:33,336
That's good.

723
00:35:37,678 --> 00:35:38,808
Good work today.

724
00:35:43,681 --> 00:35:45,048
You know what that was?

725
00:35:45,448 --> 00:35:47,157
That was the attaboy.

726
00:35:48,069 --> 00:35:50,156
This may have been the most
exhausting day of my life,

727
00:35:50,276 --> 00:35:52,543
my back is killing me...
No offense...

728
00:35:52,712 --> 00:35:55,200
And I haven't seen the inside
of an OR in...

729
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:58,027
I don't know how long, but...

730
00:35:58,318 --> 00:35:59,614
but I got the attaboy.

731
00:35:59,761 --> 00:36:01,197
I'm turning it around.

732
00:36:01,658 --> 00:36:04,254
And you're gonna get the punching
under control, right?

733
00:36:04,807 --> 00:36:06,610
Oh, you and me, you know,

734
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:10,341
boy, it takes us a while,
but we get there.

735
00:36:13,247 --> 00:36:14,600
We reached the tumor.

736
00:36:17,312 --> 00:36:19,518
But there was swelling
in Greta's brain.

737
00:36:20,677 --> 00:36:21,897
We did an MRI,

738
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:25,188
and it suggested that the swelling

739
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:28,024
in her brain
caused a great deal of damage.

740
00:36:29,088 --> 00:36:31,184
It doesn't look like
she's gonna wake up.

741
00:36:34,403 --> 00:36:35,474
Mr. Barret...

742
00:36:36,924 --> 00:36:38,285
We're so sorry.

743
00:36:39,487 --> 00:36:40,839
We should've waited.

744
00:36:42,346 --> 00:36:43,557
We didn't think...

745
00:36:45,872 --> 00:36:48,529
I didn't think you were coming.

746
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,509
The whole story just

747
00:36:51,781 --> 00:36:53,593
sounded so incredible.

748
00:36:55,163 --> 00:36:57,012
She told you about
the shoe, right?

749
00:36:59,444 --> 00:37:01,247
It makes us both sound crazy.

750
00:37:03,905 --> 00:37:06,910
I could never get that image
out of my head...

751
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:11,302
Her running up the gangplank
with one shoe,

752
00:37:12,094 --> 00:37:13,278
wind in her hair.

753
00:37:14,459 --> 00:37:16,531
Most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

754
00:37:18,651 --> 00:37:20,181
She might wake up, right?

755
00:37:21,112 --> 00:37:24,094
I mean, it's been a fairy tale from
the start. They always wake up.

756
00:37:32,773 --> 00:37:34,923
<i>Don't wonder
why people go crazy.</i>

757
00:37:37,307 --> 00:37:39,142
<i>Wonder why they don't.</i>

758
00:37:51,601 --> 00:37:54,056
<i>In the face of all we can lose
in a day...</i>

759
00:37:56,694 --> 00:37:57,961
<i>In an instant...</i>

760
00:38:03,822 --> 00:38:05,573
<i>Wonder what the hell it is...</i>

761
00:38:07,917 --> 00:38:09,701
<i>That makes us hold it together.</i>

762
00:38:22,962 --> 00:38:23,890
Ladies.

763
00:38:25,969 --> 00:38:27,844
He's thinking about a threesome.

764
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,854
- I'm not.
- You are.

765
00:38:30,146 --> 00:38:33,487
He has been...
All day.

766
00:38:34,397 --> 00:38:35,402
Okay, fine.

767
00:38:36,061 --> 00:38:37,946
I got a new leaf,
not a lobotomy.

768
00:38:38,106 --> 00:38:40,118
You couldn't handle
the two of us.

769
00:38:40,238 --> 00:38:41,157
But I could.

770
00:38:41,317 --> 00:38:43,159
I won't, but I could.

771
00:38:43,319 --> 00:38:45,704
You wouldn't find it
intimidating?

772
00:38:46,153 --> 00:38:47,158
Not at all.

773
00:39:00,076 --> 00:39:02,011
See? Too much for you.

774
00:39:06,783 --> 00:39:07,872
Damn it!

775
00:39:08,585 --> 00:39:09,978
On call room right now.

776
00:39:27,383 --> 00:39:28,397
Rose.

777
00:39:31,638 --> 00:39:33,547
You, uh...
You want to go have dinner?

778
00:39:33,667 --> 00:39:35,760
- No, I'm sorry. I can't.
- Oh, come on.

779
00:39:37,122 --> 00:39:38,974
We spent a night together
then you vanish.

780
00:39:39,094 --> 00:39:41,677
Now I wish I was secure enough
to handle that without a bruised ego

781
00:39:41,797 --> 00:39:43,566
and a lot of processed sugar,
but I'm not.

782
00:39:43,686 --> 00:39:46,097
Wait, wait, wait.
Can't we just make this easier?

783
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,892
I don't...

784
00:39:49,708 --> 00:39:52,487
Look, I don't want... I...
See, I've done complicated.

785
00:39:52,842 --> 00:39:54,494
I don't want to do that again.

786
00:39:55,115 --> 00:39:56,664
Can't this just be easy?

787
00:39:59,102 --> 00:40:00,126
Fun?

788
00:40:02,021 --> 00:40:03,365
We don't need that...

789
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:05,510
Fairy-tale thing right now.

790
00:40:05,829 --> 00:40:07,444
We just need a little happy.

791
00:40:52,203 --> 00:40:54,861
My mother tried to kill herself
when I was a kid...

792
00:40:56,616 --> 00:40:58,956
After the love of her life
disappeared.

793
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,476
I never told anybody that before.

794
00:41:06,281 --> 00:41:07,297
Okay.

795
00:41:10,094 --> 00:41:11,841
So you think I'm broken?

796
00:41:13,467 --> 00:41:14,500
Fix me.

797
00:41:15,674 --> 00:41:17,120
'Cause I'm no quitter.

798
00:41:19,903 --> 00:41:20,983
Let's go.
