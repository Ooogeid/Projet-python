1
00:00:00,795 --> 00:00:02,193
My name is Jane Vasco.

2
00:00:02,249 --> 00:00:03,555
I could use you on my team.

3
00:00:03,668 --> 00:00:07,217
I work for a secret government
agency that hunts Neuros.

4
00:00:07,264 --> 00:00:10,605
People who can do dangerous
things with their minds.

5
00:00:11,362 --> 00:00:12,850
On my first assignment...

6
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:14,965
something a little weird happened,

7
00:00:15,105 --> 00:00:17,999
okay, something really weird.

8
00:00:18,595 --> 00:00:21,508
Until I get some answers
I'm getting on with my life,

9
00:00:21,863 --> 00:00:23,239
doing my job...

10
00:00:23,344 --> 00:00:25,267
stocking up on aspirin...

11
00:00:25,281 --> 00:00:27,943
because I gotta tell ya,

12
00:00:28,692 --> 00:00:30,521
pain's a bitch!

13
00:00:31,237 --> 00:00:33,955
SOUTHSIDE JEWELRY 1:12 A.M.

14
00:00:55,401 --> 00:00:57,074
Hands in the air!

15
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,312
You first.

16
00:01:15,349 --> 00:01:17,207
Ahhhh!

17
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:22,419
Riley, he's got a gun,
he stormed the premises.

18
00:01:25,934 --> 00:01:27,825
Jane, you and I go in the back.

19
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:35,043
There should be a security key pad
next to the rear door handle.

20
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:39,225
Connor, front door.

21
00:01:40,529 --> 00:01:44,311
Code sequence is 6-7-4-9-5 pound!

22
00:01:46,143 --> 00:01:47,148
Crap.

23
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:51,510
Back corridor is about 12 feet long,
it leads to the main area to the right.

24
00:01:59,308 --> 00:02:01,186
Connor, he's going out the front.

25
00:02:01,497 --> 00:02:03,621
Hey, what's the rush?

26
00:02:09,578 --> 00:02:11,427
Sniper!

27
00:02:21,853 --> 00:02:25,868
PAINKILLER JANE 1x13 "THE LEAGE"
Subtitles subXpacio and TusSeries

28
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:29,842
Let's face it, unless you're a farmer,
in the army,

29
00:02:29,977 --> 00:02:32,030
work the breakfast shift,
or have kids,

30
00:02:32,078 --> 00:02:35,827
there's no reason to be up this early.
What's my excuse?

31
00:02:36,026 --> 00:02:38,622
I'd like to think of myself
as an A-type fitness junkie,

32
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:41,366
trying to pack a workout
into my busy schedule.

33
00:02:41,525 --> 00:02:46,414
The truth is I'm more of a B-type couch
potato who's trying to exercise the demons.

34
00:02:47,194 --> 00:02:50,608
Didn't really worry about
cardio-vascular health when I was little,

35
00:02:51,114 --> 00:02:54,894
because of my condition,
don't worry about it much now either.

36
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:58,726
For me it's all about endurance,
even though I can heal,

37
00:02:58,927 --> 00:03:02,551
getting pegged with an
AK-47 doesn't exactly tickle.

38
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:05,958
So it helps to be able to
run like hell when you need to.

39
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:11,049
Jumping rope, this was fun
as a kid, singing silly songs,

40
00:03:11,242 --> 00:03:13,753
somehow not as much fun now.

41
00:03:14,271 --> 00:03:18,304
I go at it hard, and I don't have
to worry about overdoing it.

42
00:03:18,673 --> 00:03:20,417
I still get sore which...

43
00:03:20,581 --> 00:03:23,543
fortunately doesn't last as long
as it does in normal people.

44
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:27,001
I guess you could say,
no pain, no Jane.

45
00:03:28,712 --> 00:03:30,375
What've you got?

46
00:03:30,682 --> 00:03:35,366
Preliminaries. The contents of the guy's
wallet I.D. him as Frank Diangelo.

47
00:03:35,905 --> 00:03:39,477
I checked his last known address,
workplace everything is invalid.

48
00:03:39,515 --> 00:03:41,786
- Still working on it.
- You're still working on it?!

49
00:03:42,002 --> 00:03:44,096
Seth is running an autopsy
on Diangelo right now.

50
00:03:44,119 --> 00:03:46,358
He's also running DNA samples
on the coffee cup...

51
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:48,932
Connor found at the suspected
sniper location.

52
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:51,322
Hopefully, we'll find
answers soon, right Riley?

53
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,794
Whoever it was did us
a favor whackin' this freak.

54
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:56,882
First of all, we don't even know if
the Neuro was the intended target.

55
00:03:56,917 --> 00:03:59,698
Andre. We have a problem.

56
00:04:00,413 --> 00:04:04,805
The man on my examination
table is not a Neuro.

57
00:04:05,884 --> 00:04:07,376
How could that be?

58
00:04:07,574 --> 00:04:10,166
The guy practically threw
a jewelry store at us.

59
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:12,625
Yes, Seth, how can that be?

60
00:04:12,864 --> 00:04:15,195
I'm beginning to wonder
if we're witnessing a...

61
00:04:15,227 --> 00:04:18,311
a shift in the Neuro pattern. Something
that doesn't show up on our tests.

62
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:21,375
Just what we need. The freaks're
comin' in 57 varieties now.

63
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:24,021
We've seen variations that we
don't understand in the past.

64
00:04:24,205 --> 00:04:25,819
If the genetic pattern is mutating...

65
00:04:25,868 --> 00:04:28,041
Is there any way you can refine
your testing procedures?

66
00:04:28,153 --> 00:04:29,676
We've got to know what
we're looking for.

67
00:04:29,711 --> 00:04:32,605
If you can't identify them
we can't stop them.

68
00:04:32,674 --> 00:04:34,182
- I'll do my best.
- Thank you.

69
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:36,577
Riley, I need a history on this guy,
sooner than later.

70
00:04:36,763 --> 00:04:38,973
I know. You want to see
what I got on the other cases?

71
00:04:39,355 --> 00:04:42,335
- The robberies?
- All right. Show me what you got.

72
00:04:42,929 --> 00:04:46,286
- You're not going to believe this one.
- Yeah, it's been that kind of day.

73
00:04:47,534 --> 00:04:50,626
That's the Essex hotel, three months ago.

74
00:04:51,953 --> 00:04:54,657
$40,000 in jewelry gone in one night.

75
00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:57,712
Night clerk saw nothing.
No one came in through security.

76
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,530
No one can figure out
how the hell it happened.

77
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,886
Almost nobody. I've been working
the case this last week.

78
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,376
Finally decided to run it
with a thermal overlay.

79
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,116
Check this out.

80
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,246
What are we looking at?

81
00:05:10,372 --> 00:05:12,877
You mean, what aren't we looking at?

82
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,521
An invisible man?

83
00:05:24,331 --> 00:05:27,621
- Imagine the possibilities.
- How do you think he's doing this Riley?

84
00:05:27,841 --> 00:05:29,490
You think he's jamming
the security cameras?

85
00:05:29,547 --> 00:05:31,909
No. Been there, done that.

86
00:05:32,236 --> 00:05:34,457
There were eye-witnesses or...

87
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:36,894
rather non-eye witnesses.

88
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:39,867
But nobody saw the guy enter
or leave the area.

89
00:05:39,952 --> 00:05:42,606
I mean, I hate to admit this but
I think Connor might be right.

90
00:05:43,569 --> 00:05:45,299
We may have an invisible man on our hands.

91
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,757
- You're kidding me?!
- No, I'm not kidding you.

92
00:05:47,877 --> 00:05:50,685
You just brought in a guy that could
throw furniture across the room...

93
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,183
without even touching it.

94
00:05:52,292 --> 00:05:53,934
What else do you have on this guy?

95
00:05:54,094 --> 00:05:57,661
Ok, boss, what do you want me to do?
Run a facial recognition scan?

96
00:05:57,776 --> 00:06:01,646
Or better yet, maybe run his photos
through known databases?

97
00:06:01,938 --> 00:06:04,216
I mean, how do you catch
something you can't see?

98
00:06:04,247 --> 00:06:05,987
Think of something.

99
00:06:09,549 --> 00:06:13,731
Yeah, all right. Listen, Arlene,
I'll see what I can do.

100
00:06:14,187 --> 00:06:16,102
I might have some
time this week.

101
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:19,508
Miss you too.

102
00:06:19,884 --> 00:06:21,560
I'll talk to you later.

103
00:06:42,143 --> 00:06:44,451
Yo, guys, check this out!

104
00:06:47,837 --> 00:06:49,675
Picked this up off Satcom.

105
00:06:49,702 --> 00:06:53,158
John Ferguson was found dead
in Marine Park with his throat slit.

106
00:06:53,443 --> 00:06:56,739
An eyewitness swears that no one was
around for 100 yards when this happened.

107
00:06:57,082 --> 00:06:59,225
- The invisible man?
- It fits.

108
00:06:59,322 --> 00:07:01,209
From petty theft to murder?

109
00:07:01,933 --> 00:07:04,286
Perp doesn't usually shift
his M.O. without a reason.

110
00:07:04,304 --> 00:07:06,296
Which makes Ferguson our best lead.

111
00:07:06,331 --> 00:07:09,333
We find out who wanted him dead,
we might find our Neuro.

112
00:07:09,494 --> 00:07:11,212
- Was he married?
- Yeah.

113
00:07:11,329 --> 00:07:12,750
What difference does that make?

114
00:07:12,785 --> 00:07:16,540
The first person to want a man dead
is usually his wife. Let's check this out.

115
00:07:27,412 --> 00:07:30,700
I did some further analysis
of our telekinetic jewel thief.

116
00:07:30,735 --> 00:07:34,674
I found a mass of anaplastic cells
in what's left of his temporal lobe.

117
00:07:35,108 --> 00:07:36,953
You found a brain tumor.

118
00:07:37,171 --> 00:07:41,253
Not like any I've seen before. I'm sending
off a sample for further analysis, but...

119
00:07:41,402 --> 00:07:43,897
judging from the compression
of the surrounding tissue,

120
00:07:43,982 --> 00:07:46,082
it's been growing rather rapidly of late.

121
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:49,745
Is this enough to explain a man
throwing around furniture with his mind?

122
00:07:50,325 --> 00:07:52,295
I don't have an answer for that.

123
00:07:52,938 --> 00:07:55,511
Been a little short
on answers lately, doctor...

124
00:07:56,311 --> 00:07:58,057
I need something.

125
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:05,206
All right, Ferguson was
divorced six years ago.

126
00:08:05,341 --> 00:08:06,468
What about the ex?

127
00:08:06,564 --> 00:08:09,118
Remarried got a bundle
off divorce too.

128
00:08:09,249 --> 00:08:12,701
It seems Ferg's has spent the last
six years making up for lost time.

129
00:08:13,381 --> 00:08:16,381
With the amount of money this guy had,
he could do some serious making up.

130
00:08:16,555 --> 00:08:18,192
And we care about this because...

131
00:08:18,316 --> 00:08:20,840
You got to figure a guy like this
has at least a dozen honeys just...

132
00:08:20,976 --> 00:08:22,654
waiting for the phone to ring.

133
00:08:22,701 --> 00:08:25,925
One of those honies has a husband,
he catches wind of this, and it's...

134
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,245
sayonara John.

135
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,903
Can you pull the phone records?

136
00:08:28,938 --> 00:08:32,892
They're all business related.
Office, clients, assistants.

137
00:08:33,024 --> 00:08:34,953
Try the after hours stuff.

138
00:08:41,184 --> 00:08:45,448
Ok, here we go. Got a list
of a dozen calls, all to the same number.

139
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:48,139
All between the hours
of 8:00 and 10:00 p.m.

140
00:08:48,281 --> 00:08:50,244
It sounds like slap and tickle time to me.

141
00:08:50,888 --> 00:08:53,905
It's also the last call he made
the afternoon he was killed.

142
00:08:54,924 --> 00:08:57,678
- Arlene Wedge.
- You got an address to go along with that?

143
00:09:04,661 --> 00:09:06,175
Not sure that's gonna help.

144
00:09:06,281 --> 00:09:09,644
Arlene Wedge was found this morning
in a dumpster with her throat slit.

145
00:09:12,015 --> 00:09:13,607
Okay...

146
00:09:13,646 --> 00:09:19,581
So our invisible Neuro kills
Mr. Ferguson and his girlfriend.

147
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,993
Wait...

148
00:09:22,156 --> 00:09:24,160
is there a Mr. Wedge?

149
00:09:26,697 --> 00:09:29,551
Patrick Wedge. 3318 Walnut street.

150
00:09:29,582 --> 00:09:31,972
C'mon, darlin', smells
like Neuro time to me.

151
00:10:01,304 --> 00:10:02,883
Look, if Wedge is our Neuro,

152
00:10:03,052 --> 00:10:06,385
we have to catch him off-guard and
Chip him fast while we can still see him.

153
00:10:07,081 --> 00:10:07,959
And if not...

154
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:11,669
Is best to shoot first, ask questions
later. It's my kind of interview.

155
00:10:12,327 --> 00:10:13,598
Let's go.

156
00:10:24,286 --> 00:10:26,169
- Federal agents!
- Ow!

157
00:10:26,931 --> 00:10:29,912
- What are you doing?!
- We're gonna sell you to the circus, pal.

158
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:41,121
Where the hell did he go?

159
00:10:41,239 --> 00:10:42,396
There!

160
00:11:24,552 --> 00:11:27,868
Sniper shot. Just like with Diangelo.

161
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:38,802
Patrick Wedge tested the same
as the other, Neuro negative.

162
00:11:39,076 --> 00:11:40,957
Guy went see-thru in my hands, doc.

163
00:11:41,145 --> 00:11:43,530
Well, at least that explains
why the chip had no effect.

164
00:11:43,609 --> 00:11:45,275
That's not all.

165
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:48,999
Patrick Wedge, had the same type
of brain tumor as Frank Diangelo.

166
00:11:49,034 --> 00:11:50,771
Same mass, same location.

167
00:11:50,819 --> 00:11:54,041
- Two in a row. What's up with that?
- I have absolutely no idea.

168
00:11:54,151 --> 00:11:56,221
Fortunately, there is
someone else who might.

169
00:11:56,323 --> 00:11:57,682
The shooter.

170
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,461
You get the DNA results on that coffee cup
from the first sniper location yet?

171
00:12:01,593 --> 00:12:05,020
- It's on my list.
- Yesterday, doctor.

172
00:12:08,475 --> 00:12:12,975
Twice now the shooter's knew where
we'd be and when we'd be there.

173
00:12:13,094 --> 00:12:17,638
- You think we have a security problem?
- Ok, there is no security problem.

174
00:12:17,727 --> 00:12:20,967
- Then double-check it.
- Fine.

175
00:12:21,226 --> 00:12:23,860
What's going on here, boss?
We got Neuros who aren't Neuros.

176
00:12:23,895 --> 00:12:26,495
A shooter taking out people
from underneath us. Brain tumors.

177
00:12:27,186 --> 00:12:29,757
I don't know but I'm going
to try to find some answers though.

178
00:12:29,836 --> 00:12:32,005
If anything develops, I'd be on my comm.

179
00:12:55,585 --> 00:12:57,181
I need to know...

180
00:12:57,809 --> 00:12:59,975
do we have a problem?

181
00:13:00,801 --> 00:13:03,662
You tell me, do we?

182
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:06,823
Are you aware of any shift
in the Neuro pattern?

183
00:13:08,334 --> 00:13:10,332
If I had that information,
you would have it.

184
00:13:10,357 --> 00:13:15,248
I've got two corpses, both
very Neuro-like, both testing negative.

185
00:13:15,292 --> 00:13:17,353
I've read Dr. Carpenter's reports.

186
00:13:19,142 --> 00:13:22,149
Those two men were taken out
right from under my people in the field.

187
00:13:22,232 --> 00:13:24,051
I'm aware of the situation.

188
00:13:24,576 --> 00:13:26,427
How do you think I can help?

189
00:13:27,247 --> 00:13:29,192
Why don't you tell me the truth?

190
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:33,337
You got anyone else working our cases?
Someone with shoot-to-kill orders?

191
00:13:33,725 --> 00:13:36,149
Whatever you're up against,
whoever this shooter is,

192
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,461
it is not coming from my office.

193
00:13:39,229 --> 00:13:41,619
- I need to believe that.
- You need to get to the bottom of this...

194
00:13:41,703 --> 00:13:43,324
and resolve it.

195
00:13:45,034 --> 00:13:47,294
And I need to be somewhere
in ten minutes.

196
00:13:49,674 --> 00:13:54,552
And agent McBride, in the future,
wipe your feet before you get in my car.

197
00:14:08,846 --> 00:14:10,449
Riley.

198
00:14:12,515 --> 00:14:14,109
Hey!

199
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:15,929
I'm awake!

200
00:14:18,352 --> 00:14:20,995
Eighty percent done,
and no signs of a breach.

201
00:14:21,115 --> 00:14:23,215
- We're tight as a drum.
- All right, when this is over,

202
00:14:23,331 --> 00:14:25,301
I need complete histories
on Diangelo and Wedge.

203
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:26,731
I'm looking for places
where they intersect.

204
00:14:26,852 --> 00:14:28,677
I believe I can help with that.

205
00:14:30,518 --> 00:14:32,568
I've been conducting
some field interviews.

206
00:14:33,929 --> 00:14:35,495
He does go out.

207
00:14:35,538 --> 00:14:38,401
I'm as eager to find answers to
this situation as any of you are.

208
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:39,821
- And did you find any?
- There was nothing...

209
00:14:39,894 --> 00:14:43,143
in the medical records of either man
to explain the tumors I found, but...

210
00:14:43,178 --> 00:14:45,301
I did learn one interesting thing.

211
00:14:45,731 --> 00:14:48,739
Frank Diangelo and Patrick Wedge
were born four months apart.

212
00:14:48,987 --> 00:14:52,220
They both attended Rossmore High
School, graduating the same year.

213
00:14:52,282 --> 00:14:53,833
So maybe they
knew each other.

214
00:14:53,868 --> 00:14:55,924
Hey, that's more than we knew
24 hours ago. Good work, Seth.

215
00:14:56,048 --> 00:14:58,356
There is one more thing.
I was able to isolate a DNA sample...

216
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:01,088
from that coffee cup that
Connor found in the sniper's nest.

217
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:03,675
The shooter is a male,
late 20's, like the victims.

218
00:15:03,781 --> 00:15:06,003
Another schoolmate?
Settling an old score?

219
00:15:06,082 --> 00:15:09,770
There's something else.
The shooter's Neuro positive.

220
00:15:13,731 --> 00:15:17,509
Let's see if we can find anything else
interesting about Diangelo and Wedge here.

221
00:15:17,844 --> 00:15:20,706
Maybe they were in
AP Neuro class together.

222
00:15:30,777 --> 00:15:33,328
It's a good thing you only made it
to the eighth grade.

223
00:15:33,363 --> 00:15:36,158
Wouldn't'a made a difference.
I went to an all boy school.

224
00:15:37,453 --> 00:15:40,345
Public, private, or reform?

225
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,104
Are you a cop?

226
00:16:12,825 --> 00:16:15,725
- Yeah, something like that.
- What're you working on?

227
00:16:17,129 --> 00:16:19,905
I'm sorry, darlin',
I'm really not at liberty to say.

228
00:16:21,616 --> 00:16:24,182
- How old are you?
- Old enough.

229
00:16:25,921 --> 00:16:29,165
Well, then you ought to know better than
to be playing games "off campus."

230
00:16:29,314 --> 00:16:31,912
That's how little giris
like you get into trouble.

231
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,362
I'm not a little girl.

232
00:16:37,343 --> 00:16:41,391
Do not pass go, do not collect $200,
go directly to jail.

233
00:16:41,587 --> 00:16:44,217
- There only was a day.
- Yeah, the good old days.

234
00:16:45,658 --> 00:16:47,701
You could've offered her
your prison ring.

235
00:16:49,306 --> 00:16:50,879
Anyway, check this out.

236
00:16:51,562 --> 00:16:56,554
Wedge and Diangelo.
Our two dead guys were friends.

237
00:16:57,985 --> 00:17:00,009
"LEAGUE OF 5"

238
00:17:00,256 --> 00:17:01,981
What's with "the league of 5?"

239
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:05,194
Yeah, that's just one of the things I'd
like to ask the people in this picture.

240
00:17:06,572 --> 00:17:10,713
Ladies and gentlemen, meet the short
lived superhero team "The League of 5."

241
00:17:11,101 --> 00:17:13,272
First issue came out
about 16 years ago.

242
00:17:13,392 --> 00:17:17,428
It was actually pretty good too.
Until Dynamite Comics canceled it.

243
00:17:17,477 --> 00:17:21,725
Nowadays all these comics and their
superheroes are all these matinee idols,

244
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,484
- Riley...
- What?

245
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:24,895
- Come on.
- Ok.

246
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:27,269
For your information, it's a great book.

247
00:17:27,701 --> 00:17:31,549
Now, I've got five issues tucked
safely away in my storage boxes...

248
00:17:31,613 --> 00:17:33,252
In your mom's basement?

249
00:17:33,792 --> 00:17:35,436
Where you live.

250
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,495
All right, we know from Seth
that the shooter is male,

251
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,811
so our best bet is to
question these two guys,

252
00:17:39,846 --> 00:17:41,822
Harold Borgman and
Alvin Prescott.

253
00:17:41,976 --> 00:17:43,991
I've got an address on Borgman.

254
00:17:44,353 --> 00:17:46,224
But Prescott's pretty much a loner.

255
00:17:46,726 --> 00:17:48,797
He lives in a trailer up in the hills.

256
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:51,440
All right, Connor,
why don't you question Harold?

257
00:17:51,617 --> 00:17:53,514
Jane bring Alvin Prescott
back here for questioning.

258
00:17:53,617 --> 00:17:55,306
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

259
00:18:02,318 --> 00:18:04,531
Don't get up, sweetheart,
I'll let myself in.

260
00:18:05,113 --> 00:18:06,964
Harold Borgman?

261
00:18:07,922 --> 00:18:11,547
- Yes. Who are you?
- Connor King. Federal agent.

262
00:18:12,639 --> 00:18:13,658
Oh.

263
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,443
You know what this is about?

264
00:18:16,922 --> 00:18:18,529
Why don't you take a seat?

265
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:21,601
I have a better idea,
why don't you come with me?

266
00:18:37,219 --> 00:18:39,780
I appreciate your cooperation,
Mr. Prescott.

267
00:18:39,873 --> 00:18:41,933
It's not like I had a lot of choice.

268
00:18:42,819 --> 00:18:45,413
Your life could
be in serious danger.

269
00:18:47,348 --> 00:18:49,941
Two of your classmates
were killed recently.

270
00:18:51,837 --> 00:18:52,998
Really?

271
00:18:54,056 --> 00:18:55,899
I don't keep up with them.

272
00:18:56,456 --> 00:19:00,065
If you're not involved,
I'll have you home in a few hours.

273
00:19:00,486 --> 00:19:02,438
What do you mean involved?

274
00:19:03,546 --> 00:19:05,993
You think I had something
to do with them been killed?

275
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:08,592
We just want to ask you a few questions.

276
00:21:15,369 --> 00:21:19,439
In my time with the team, I had seen
some pretty strange Neuro powers,

277
00:21:19,518 --> 00:21:23,986
and the ability to basically put
someone in a class on acid...

278
00:21:24,021 --> 00:21:26,920
is definitely in the top 5.

279
00:21:27,303 --> 00:21:31,103
Still it was effective, I have to admit.

280
00:21:36,908 --> 00:21:40,555
That's your man. 100 percent
DNA match for the shooter.

281
00:21:40,614 --> 00:21:42,844
- And a Neuro.
- Yes.

282
00:21:42,976 --> 00:21:46,940
A Neuro who uses a sniper rifle on
non-Neuros with Neuro-like powers.

283
00:21:47,697 --> 00:21:50,716
Yup. It's all coming together.

284
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:54,423
Indeed.

285
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:08,665
Mr. Borgman...

286
00:22:12,461 --> 00:22:14,470
You can call me Harold.

287
00:22:15,062 --> 00:22:16,568
All right Harold,

288
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,382
I was hoping you can
clear some of this up for me.

289
00:22:21,908 --> 00:22:23,565
I'll do my best.

290
00:22:25,464 --> 00:22:27,618
Why are you killing your friends?

291
00:22:29,763 --> 00:22:31,840
What other choice did I have?

292
00:22:33,857 --> 00:22:36,323
You understand, don't you agent McBride?

293
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,530
It's the only way to stop them.

294
00:22:40,085 --> 00:22:42,130
They do need to be stopped.

295
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:48,444
All right, why don't you start
from the beginning?

296
00:22:50,746 --> 00:22:52,506
We were just kids.

297
00:22:53,229 --> 00:22:55,064
Oddballs.

298
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:57,933
We'd all been friends
since the seventh grade.

299
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:01,047
Pat and I, we were
the comic book junkies.

300
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:04,611
We used to talk about how great it would
be to have those kinds of powers.

301
00:23:05,648 --> 00:23:08,267
- To be... special.
- All right.

302
00:23:09,643 --> 00:23:11,652
We were used to being picked on...

303
00:23:12,639 --> 00:23:15,032
As much as you can get used
to something like that.

304
00:23:23,744 --> 00:23:26,308
I guess in the end
I finally had enough of it.

305
00:23:26,814 --> 00:23:29,948
So I... made them better.

306
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,415
It's hard to explain.

307
00:23:33,198 --> 00:23:35,001
I mean, somehow, I knew I could do it.

308
00:23:35,067 --> 00:23:38,349
I could give them each this gift
of something extraordinary.

309
00:23:39,068 --> 00:23:40,808
Everyone got to pick what they wanted.

310
00:23:42,012 --> 00:23:43,878
Frankie wanted to be telekinetic...

311
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,569
Guess he was always the weakling.

312
00:23:47,007 --> 00:23:49,005
Invisibility, that went to Pat.

313
00:23:49,273 --> 00:23:51,302
You could imagine
what he had in mind.

314
00:23:53,144 --> 00:23:57,424
Vivian Gray got the gift of persuasion.

315
00:23:57,573 --> 00:24:00,803
Everyone goes along with what
she asks for. They can't help it.

316
00:24:02,627 --> 00:24:06,461
And Alvin... Alvin was always getting
picked on for being stupid or whatever,

317
00:24:06,569 --> 00:24:09,454
so I offered him the ability
to confuse others.

318
00:24:10,961 --> 00:24:12,846
Make things unclear to them.

319
00:24:14,898 --> 00:24:16,912
That was a classic,

320
00:24:17,603 --> 00:24:20,745
I gotta tell you the football team
lost a lot of ground that year.

321
00:24:21,366 --> 00:24:24,674
And you, no special powers?

322
00:24:25,237 --> 00:24:26,691
No.

323
00:24:27,896 --> 00:24:30,175
That's something else I don't understand.

324
00:24:31,578 --> 00:24:34,481
Seems I can give the gift away.
But not to myself.

325
00:24:34,695 --> 00:24:36,388
Maybe it's better that way.

326
00:24:36,563 --> 00:24:38,265
We were just kids.

327
00:24:39,551 --> 00:24:42,234
We had high hopes of
doing great things.

328
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:45,070
Use the powers for good.

329
00:24:47,149 --> 00:24:49,099
Then we grew up.

330
00:24:49,455 --> 00:24:51,196
Drifted apart.

331
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:54,866
- And nobody did "great things."
- No.

332
00:24:56,985 --> 00:25:00,210
I think we underestimate
the innocence of children.

333
00:25:01,828 --> 00:25:04,397
And I couldn't let them keep
doing what they were doing.

334
00:25:04,646 --> 00:25:07,955
Franky just took what he wanted.
He didn't care who he hurt.

335
00:25:10,336 --> 00:25:11,807
And Pat...

336
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:15,072
When he found out his wife
was seeing another man...

337
00:25:15,395 --> 00:25:17,403
killed that man.

338
00:25:18,395 --> 00:25:20,608
I feel like I had a part in that.

339
00:25:21,137 --> 00:25:22,577
So you killed him.

340
00:25:22,948 --> 00:25:24,808
He was my friend.

341
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:29,515
I tried to talk to him. But he wouldn't
listen. None of them would.

342
00:25:30,088 --> 00:25:34,533
I tried to undo what I'd done.
But I couldn't.

343
00:25:34,864 --> 00:25:36,925
I couldn't erase the powers.

344
00:25:37,104 --> 00:25:38,734
There's no reversing it.

345
00:25:38,915 --> 00:25:40,887
There was no one
I could go to for help and...

346
00:25:41,236 --> 00:25:44,201
and they were getting stronger,
all of them.

347
00:25:48,204 --> 00:25:50,265
I could only think of
one way to stop them.

348
00:25:54,498 --> 00:25:56,148
That wasn't a little crash, boss.

349
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,236
Even Jane was lucky to
walk away from this one.

350
00:25:58,287 --> 00:26:00,785
Yeah, but she didn't catch up
with Alvin Prescott. He is still missing.

351
00:26:00,906 --> 00:26:03,633
Hell, it's like dealing with a
Neuro who can photocopy himself.

352
00:26:03,668 --> 00:26:05,326
Yeah, except these people aren't Neuros.

353
00:26:05,637 --> 00:26:07,727
Riley, got a line on Alvin Prescott?

354
00:26:08,303 --> 00:26:11,197
Yeah, I've got a bird over his trailer but
no activity.

355
00:26:11,297 --> 00:26:12,736
What about Vivian Gray?

356
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,817
Took me awhile until I realized
I had the wrong name.

357
00:26:16,378 --> 00:26:18,435
You might know her by her married name.

358
00:26:18,783 --> 00:26:20,591
Vivian Nash.

359
00:26:21,632 --> 00:26:23,483
The Congresswoman?

360
00:26:26,734 --> 00:26:29,693
I'm sorry, Congresswoman,
but I just can't give my support...

361
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:31,690
to your proposed construction bill.

362
00:26:32,179 --> 00:26:34,114
We've discussed this before.

363
00:26:35,096 --> 00:26:36,989
Is there any way you'd reconsider?

364
00:26:37,048 --> 00:26:39,260
We've worked so well together
on projects in the past.

365
00:26:39,482 --> 00:26:43,467
We've always worked well together,
but this is somebody that...

366
00:26:43,863 --> 00:26:46,272
I'd really like
to reach an agreement, Paul.

367
00:26:53,296 --> 00:26:56,026
Of course, I want the same thing.

368
00:26:56,786 --> 00:26:59,747
This bill is going to help so many people,
and the costs are reasonable.

369
00:26:59,903 --> 00:27:01,680
I know that's important to you.

370
00:27:02,232 --> 00:27:04,426
It's not an unreasonable proposal.

371
00:27:04,882 --> 00:27:07,551
I do see the advantages
of putting it through.

372
00:27:07,735 --> 00:27:10,216
So, I can count on your 'yes' vote?

373
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:11,704
Of course.

374
00:27:12,625 --> 00:27:13,891
Excellent.

375
00:27:14,874 --> 00:27:16,606
- Vivian!
- I'm sorry Congresswoman.

376
00:27:16,641 --> 00:27:18,595
- I tried to stop him!
- Vivian, there's a problem...

377
00:27:18,864 --> 00:27:22,186
It's all right, Beverly. Mr. Prescott
is a valued friend. He's always welcome.

378
00:27:22,221 --> 00:27:24,193
Of course, Mr. Prescott.
I'm so sorry.

379
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:27,040
- If you'll excuse us.
- Certainly.

380
00:27:32,762 --> 00:27:35,738
Something's going down.
A federal agent came looking for me.

381
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,227
She was asking about Patrick
and Frank getting killed.

382
00:27:38,381 --> 00:27:40,371
And you don't know
anything about this, do you?

383
00:27:40,461 --> 00:27:42,518
Don't try and use
your little 'stuff' on me.

384
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:44,875
Ok, unless you want to be speaking
in tongues at your next rally.

385
00:27:44,974 --> 00:27:46,828
We're in the same team, Alvin.

386
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:49,846
I don't need to use my powers
to convince you of that.

387
00:27:50,496 --> 00:27:52,854
Somebody's after us.
We need to find out who.

388
00:27:54,076 --> 00:27:55,830
Tell me more about the federal agent.

389
00:27:56,163 --> 00:27:58,277
- She tried to take me in.
- Did she say where?

390
00:27:58,419 --> 00:28:01,194
I didn't want to know. I just did
what I had to get away from her.

391
00:28:01,565 --> 00:28:03,434
Have you ever heard
the word "Neuro"?

392
00:28:04,069 --> 00:28:05,427
No. What is that?

393
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,826
It's something we're not
supposed to know about.

394
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:09,038
It's the name given
to people like Harold.

395
00:28:09,189 --> 00:28:11,365
What does that mean? There is
other people like Harold out there?

396
00:28:11,397 --> 00:28:13,359
In some ways, yes.

397
00:28:13,498 --> 00:28:17,291
It seems to be quite a variety.
I'm still exploring the "area."

398
00:28:17,426 --> 00:28:19,093
How do you know all this?

399
00:28:19,917 --> 00:28:22,920
I'm involved with
a few very important people.

400
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:26,593
And, as you know, it's hard
to keep secrets from me.

401
00:28:26,921 --> 00:28:28,785
So what do these
feds want with us?

402
00:28:28,803 --> 00:28:30,806
They were looking for
Patrick and Frank,

403
00:28:31,123 --> 00:28:33,998
and now Patrick and
Frank are dead.

404
00:28:34,157 --> 00:28:37,556
- So what do we do?
- Not "we," Alvin.

405
00:28:40,541 --> 00:28:41,902
Me.

406
00:28:42,616 --> 00:28:45,592
I've ran Alvin Prescott's photo
against citywide security cams.

407
00:28:45,915 --> 00:28:47,012
Got a hit.

408
00:28:47,062 --> 00:28:49,514
Found him at the federal building
checking in with Vivian Nash.

409
00:28:49,643 --> 00:28:52,233
If we can't chip these clowns,
what's the use of finding them?

410
00:28:52,585 --> 00:28:54,436
You could contain them.

411
00:28:54,842 --> 00:28:57,172
I suggest an efficacious tranquilizer.

412
00:28:57,191 --> 00:29:00,491
It's unlikely they'd be able to utilize
their mental powers while unconscious.

413
00:29:00,827 --> 00:29:02,247
I'm on Harold's team.

414
00:29:02,447 --> 00:29:04,131
Bullet in the brain from
the nearest rooftop.

415
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:07,096
It's unlikely they'd be able to utilize
their mental powers while dead.

416
00:29:07,126 --> 00:29:09,626
You're talking about
a U.S. Congresswoman.

417
00:29:09,678 --> 00:29:11,477
Killing two birds
with one stone.

418
00:29:11,701 --> 00:29:15,655
Guys, Treasury provides security
for Congresswoman Nash.

419
00:29:16,258 --> 00:29:19,186
Even if you had a tranq pistol, how do
you expect to get close enough to use it?

420
00:29:19,261 --> 00:29:21,398
Harold just offered a suggestion for that.

421
00:29:23,587 --> 00:29:27,604
Before we chip him, how would
you like to fight fire with fire?

422
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,476
Are you saying what I think you're saying?

423
00:29:30,511 --> 00:29:33,134
He just offered us the same
superpowers he gave his friends.

424
00:29:33,256 --> 00:29:35,913
Turn us all into sideshow geeks.
I'll pass.

425
00:29:36,038 --> 00:29:37,710
Gimme a break?!

426
00:29:38,214 --> 00:29:40,577
You wouldn't want to be more
powerful than a locomotive?

427
00:29:41,101 --> 00:29:43,252
You've any idea what you could do
if you were invisible?

428
00:29:43,433 --> 00:29:46,124
- I know what you would do.
- I don't know, man.

429
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,925
Passing on a super power...

430
00:29:50,087 --> 00:29:52,280
Trust me, it's overrated.

431
00:29:52,348 --> 00:29:54,865
You're forgetting about the
tumors I found in the others.

432
00:29:54,967 --> 00:29:57,108
Advanced and inoperable.

433
00:29:57,357 --> 00:30:00,589
And from the location, likely responsible
for the personality changes...

434
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,359
Harold described in his old friends.

435
00:30:02,502 --> 00:30:06,049
Just imagine... sneaking into
the giris' locker room and...

436
00:30:06,084 --> 00:30:09,176
turning into a psychopath
before you even reach the showers.

437
00:30:09,264 --> 00:30:12,875
Okay, okay, I get it. So that's
a "no" on the superpowers.

438
00:30:13,036 --> 00:30:14,312
Bad idea.

439
00:30:14,347 --> 00:30:16,984
That still leaves us with the question of
how we get into the federal building...

440
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:21,001
with a tranq dart and score a hit on a woman
who can make us do what she wants us to.

441
00:30:21,011 --> 00:30:24,622
And it's likely Prescott's told her
about our attempt to bring him in.

442
00:30:25,543 --> 00:30:27,190
She'll have increased security.

443
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,625
I might be able to help with that.

444
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:34,967
That's a tall order, McBride.
I don't have a lot of pull with Treasury.

445
00:30:35,036 --> 00:30:36,834
No, but you do have influence.

446
00:30:37,328 --> 00:30:39,699
Look, you're asking me to interfere
with the security arrangements...

447
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:42,589
of a U.S. Congresswoman,
putting my reputation at risk.

448
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,675
Then you'll have to weigh
"your reputation" against the damage...

449
00:30:44,758 --> 00:30:46,911
these people could do
if we don't get to them.

450
00:30:47,164 --> 00:30:50,413
You've made your point.
I'll take care of it.

451
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:55,512
Thank you, Gerald.
You handled that perfectly.

452
00:30:56,545 --> 00:30:59,652
Now I just have one
more favor to ask...

453
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,120
JUST OUTSIDE CITY LIMITS

454
00:31:03,723 --> 00:31:05,868
We're someplace I'll be safe.

455
00:31:06,342 --> 00:31:11,225
All of you will protect me with your lives.
No matter who comes after me.

456
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:31,812
Nothing out of the ordinary
is going to happen here.

457
00:31:32,594 --> 00:31:34,034
Alvin!

458
00:31:45,322 --> 00:31:46,597
What did you find out?

459
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:48,750
The feds have Harold in custody.

460
00:31:48,894 --> 00:31:51,304
I seem to be the next target of interest.

461
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,777
- What are we going to do?
- We're going to look after ourselves.

462
00:31:55,865 --> 00:31:57,330
Are you armed?

463
00:31:58,386 --> 00:32:01,784
No. I couldn't risk
going back to my place.

464
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:04,853
Here, takes this.

465
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,489
Find somewhere they
won't be looking for you.

466
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,933
I think we should stay together.

467
00:32:09,082 --> 00:32:10,795
You need to look after yourself right now.

468
00:32:10,903 --> 00:32:14,060
You said that we were in this together!

469
00:32:14,176 --> 00:32:16,224
You're right, Alvin.

470
00:32:16,541 --> 00:32:18,694
We do have to look after each other.

471
00:32:18,843 --> 00:32:21,575
But your presence right now
puts me at risk.

472
00:32:22,563 --> 00:32:24,398
I think you know that.

473
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,133
I'm putting you at risk.

474
00:32:27,347 --> 00:32:29,589
And you would never
want to do that.

475
00:32:30,339 --> 00:32:33,134
You'd do anything to protect me.

476
00:32:35,561 --> 00:32:38,133
You'd rather die than get in my way.

477
00:32:39,639 --> 00:32:41,109
Yeah.

478
00:32:45,833 --> 00:32:47,674
Don't mind him.

479
00:33:07,576 --> 00:33:08,830
What's up?

480
00:33:08,878 --> 00:33:12,173
Local PD found Alvin Prescott
at a rest stop on route 75.

481
00:33:12,208 --> 00:33:13,934
Gunshot to the coconut.

482
00:33:14,113 --> 00:33:16,143
Apparently self-inflicted.

483
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:20,046
The gun is clean
and untraceable, of course.

484
00:33:20,422 --> 00:33:21,851
What about Nash?

485
00:33:22,634 --> 00:33:25,758
She's off the radar. She must
have known we were coming in.

486
00:33:27,128 --> 00:33:32,005
So much for Andre's plan to get the
bigwigs to pull back her security.

487
00:33:32,213 --> 00:33:34,347
Her security detail are missing, too.

488
00:33:34,797 --> 00:33:37,779
She must have used her "gift"
to talk them into helping her.

489
00:33:38,174 --> 00:33:41,353
She's a public figure.
How could she just disappear?

490
00:33:41,511 --> 00:33:43,784
You'd be surprised what
politicians get away with.

491
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:46,573
- I've got photos on my hard drive of...
- I got an update.

492
00:33:47,828 --> 00:33:51,506
Harold's no longer going to Nico.
He's been designated "of interest."

493
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,826
Morgan's on his way down right now
to take him into custody personally.

494
00:33:57,017 --> 00:33:59,332
Oh, and Harold is to remain unchipped.

495
00:34:00,373 --> 00:34:03,643
Morgan is coming here?
Leaving a Neuro unchipped?

496
00:34:04,207 --> 00:34:05,767
That's violating procedure.

497
00:34:06,116 --> 00:34:10,143
It's totally unlike Morgan to get involved
like this. He thrives on deniability.

498
00:34:10,178 --> 00:34:14,887
So coming down here in person
to take Harold wasn't his idea.

499
00:34:18,136 --> 00:34:19,960
You think Nash got to him?

500
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:22,666
That's what we're gonna have to find out.

501
00:34:26,143 --> 00:34:28,871
You're positive this man Morgan
has been influenced by Vivian?

502
00:34:29,029 --> 00:34:30,743
That's our take on it.

503
00:34:30,847 --> 00:34:33,126
We believe she sent him
to get you out of custody.

504
00:34:33,607 --> 00:34:35,163
Why would she do that?

505
00:34:35,376 --> 00:34:38,912
You killed Wedge and Diangelo.
We think Vivian killed Prescott.

506
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,665
Maybe she's cleaning house.

507
00:34:41,463 --> 00:34:44,419
I got to warn you, Harold,
our plan is not without risk.

508
00:34:45,882 --> 00:34:49,721
Agent McBride. I was going to shoot
my oldest friends to put an end to this.

509
00:34:49,779 --> 00:34:51,637
I'll do what it takes.

510
00:34:56,039 --> 00:34:58,169
- Chip him.
- Even though we have explicit orders to...

511
00:34:58,288 --> 00:34:59,968
Chip him.

512
00:35:06,956 --> 00:35:09,642
You know what this could do.

513
00:35:10,034 --> 00:35:12,116
Once the chip is in place,

514
00:35:12,364 --> 00:35:15,643
you'll no longer have the ability
to "empower" anyone.

515
00:35:15,888 --> 00:35:17,144
That's fine.

516
00:35:17,893 --> 00:35:21,828
This thing I can do, it's wrong.

517
00:35:22,275 --> 00:35:23,721
But it's part of you.

518
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,854
A part of you you can...

519
00:35:27,304 --> 00:35:31,078
share with your friends.

520
00:35:47,008 --> 00:35:48,744
Here's your man.

521
00:35:50,609 --> 00:35:52,029
Mr. Borgman.

522
00:35:52,113 --> 00:35:54,527
I'm going to look after you
until this business is sorted out.

523
00:35:55,152 --> 00:35:56,428
You'll be safe.

524
00:36:00,253 --> 00:36:02,118
Keep me informed.

525
00:36:02,169 --> 00:36:03,455
Of course.

526
00:36:22,279 --> 00:36:24,297
Follow at a safe distance.

527
00:36:27,713 --> 00:36:30,869
TERMINAL CITY... HALF HOUR LATER

528
00:36:40,874 --> 00:36:42,046
Harold...

529
00:36:48,948 --> 00:36:54,358
Vivian, listen to me,
you're sick.

530
00:36:55,091 --> 00:37:00,148
The powers I gave all of you,
they cause tumors, brain tumors.

531
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:03,183
You're not acting like
you normally would.

532
00:37:04,163 --> 00:37:05,878
Come, Vivian, just, just...

533
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:08,913
ask yourself how you got here.

534
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:11,513
How you've used what I gave you.

535
00:37:13,805 --> 00:37:15,644
What you've become.

536
00:37:16,116 --> 00:37:20,158
I know what you're trying to do,
Harold. You're trying to buy time.

537
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:22,732
Why did you bring me here, Vivian?

538
00:37:23,418 --> 00:37:26,124
Because you've made
such nice, new friends.

539
00:37:28,806 --> 00:37:29,765
Fire!

540
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,925
Don't listen to her,
you're under my command, now!

541
00:37:35,389 --> 00:37:38,365
You heard me!
Shoot her!

542
00:37:38,468 --> 00:37:40,438
Ignore her!

543
00:37:42,666 --> 00:37:45,273
I said kill her, damn it!

544
00:37:46,072 --> 00:37:47,940
Stand down!

545
00:37:49,454 --> 00:37:51,641
Stand down!

546
00:37:58,396 --> 00:38:00,288
What've you done?

547
00:38:00,477 --> 00:38:03,979
You knew they'd come.
But they knew you, Vivian.

548
00:38:05,715 --> 00:38:09,465
Thanks to Harold,
I've got what you've got,

549
00:38:13,685 --> 00:38:15,704
maybe even a little more.

550
00:38:16,843 --> 00:38:18,472
Secure the area.

551
00:38:40,976 --> 00:38:44,663
You took a hell of a risk accepting
Harold's powers before you chipped him.

552
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,683
You deliberately disobeyed my orders.

553
00:38:46,729 --> 00:38:49,700
Your order to chip him
was against orders.

554
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,678
I learn from the best.

555
00:38:53,812 --> 00:38:55,151
It worked.

556
00:38:55,186 --> 00:38:59,351
At what cost, Jane?
A brain tumor? Madness?

557
00:38:59,526 --> 00:39:03,181
You know me. I'll get over it.
The tumor, anyway.

558
00:39:03,201 --> 00:39:05,800
How do you know that?
It's not some injury you can heal from.

559
00:39:05,917 --> 00:39:07,547
You don't know what
you're dealing with.

560
00:39:08,338 --> 00:39:10,281
I guess I'll take my chances.

561
00:39:28,708 --> 00:39:30,046
Where am I?

562
00:39:30,271 --> 00:39:32,770
- Just relax.
- I can't seem to focus.

563
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:36,277
You're safe, Congresswoman.
I'm just running a few tests.

564
00:39:45,718 --> 00:39:47,847
So it's true, then?

565
00:39:50,987 --> 00:39:52,881
What Harold said about the tumor?

566
00:39:52,938 --> 00:39:54,890
Yes. I'm sorry.

567
00:40:01,578 --> 00:40:03,296
Is it operable?

568
00:40:03,315 --> 00:40:06,311
No. And it's quite progressed.

569
00:40:08,416 --> 00:40:10,236
I'm afraid your sedation is getting light.

570
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:14,894
Doctor, I have one small favor to ask.

571
00:40:26,645 --> 00:40:28,676
I... I don't know...

572
00:40:31,017 --> 00:40:33,248
I shot her. I shot her...

573
00:40:40,525 --> 00:40:43,007
Harold was safely on his way to Nico,

574
00:40:43,341 --> 00:40:48,101
and Vivian Gray's influence over
Morgan ended with her death.

575
00:40:48,376 --> 00:40:52,467
But we still had an internal
team injury to deal with.

576
00:40:53,757 --> 00:40:57,283
Empathy doesn't come naturally from me.
Never has.

577
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:00,729
Part of any friendship is to try
to understand what the person...

578
00:41:00,764 --> 00:41:03,938
closest to you is feeling,
what they're going through.

579
00:41:04,258 --> 00:41:07,189
But each person's experience
is unique to them.

580
00:41:07,952 --> 00:41:10,667
What I went through is
what I went through...

581
00:41:10,792 --> 00:41:13,965
The same experience could be
completely different for Seth.

582
00:41:14,285 --> 00:41:16,851
He has different reasons
to lie awake at night.

583
00:41:17,106 --> 00:41:21,754
If I want to be there for my friend, I have
to be ready to hear what he's feeling,

584
00:41:21,889 --> 00:41:24,543
not what I'd be feeling in his place.

585
00:41:25,141 --> 00:41:26,941
There's no manual for it.

586
00:41:27,088 --> 00:41:29,330
I guess I'm going to have to wing it.

587
00:41:34,432 --> 00:41:37,082
Just checking my emails.

588
00:41:38,256 --> 00:41:40,449
So, what's the prognosis
on the inside of my head?

589
00:41:40,542 --> 00:41:44,138
Well, the MRI's clean. No sign
of a tumor. You're very lucky.

590
00:41:44,292 --> 00:41:47,797
Yup, that's me. Bullets and
tumors don't leave a scratch.

591
00:41:48,955 --> 00:41:52,966
So I guess that means I'm not going to
retain the power Harold gave me either.

592
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:54,319
Actually we don't know that for sure.

593
00:41:54,412 --> 00:41:56,330
We just know that you're
not at risk from a tumor.

594
00:41:59,657 --> 00:42:01,074
What about you?

595
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:06,093
You don't seem to have retained
your sparkling bedside manner.

596
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:08,571
I have sparkling bedside manner?

597
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:11,590
No, not really.

598
00:42:11,872 --> 00:42:14,143
But it is something you could work on.

599
00:42:18,037 --> 00:42:20,031
Look Seth, you didn't kill her.

600
00:42:20,299 --> 00:42:22,121
She killed herself.

601
00:42:22,556 --> 00:42:24,109
I know.

602
00:42:27,449 --> 00:42:29,393
But I pulled the trigger.

603
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:32,685
But beating yourself up about it
isn't going to make it go away.

604
00:42:34,955 --> 00:42:36,687
We have two choices,

605
00:42:37,027 --> 00:42:40,476
we can stay here under
fluorescent lights and sulk...

606
00:42:41,778 --> 00:42:47,197
or we can we test the power that Harold
gave me by persuading the bartender...

607
00:42:47,725 --> 00:42:50,782
to give us free drinks
until the sun comes up.

608
00:42:53,513 --> 00:42:55,460
You've persuaded me.

609
00:42:56,211 --> 00:42:57,672
Let's go.

610
00:43:00,032 --> 00:43:02,215
So I really don't have
a sparkling bedside manner?

611
00:43:02,316 --> 00:43:03,416
