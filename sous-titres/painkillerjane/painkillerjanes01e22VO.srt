1
00:00:00,643 --> 00:00:02,093
My name is Jane Vasco.

2
00:00:02,146 --> 00:00:03,446
I could use you on my team.

3
00:00:03,559 --> 00:00:07,093
I work for a secret government
agency that hunts Neuros.

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,467
People who can do dangerous
things with their minds.

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,702
On my first assignment...

6
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,808
something a little weird happened,

7
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:17,829
okay, something really weird.

8
00:00:18,423 --> 00:00:21,323
Until I get some answers
I'm getting on with my life,

9
00:00:21,677 --> 00:00:23,047
doing my job...

10
00:00:23,152 --> 00:00:25,067
stocking up on aspirin...

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,731
because I gotta tell ya,

12
00:00:28,477 --> 00:00:30,337
pain's a bitch!

13
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:39,302
BUDAPEST, HUNGARY

14
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,226
OFFICE OF THE NEW DIRECTOR OF N.I.C.O.
GREG HAMILTON

15
00:00:57,962 --> 00:01:00,545
The van will be here at 10:00
to take agent McBride...

16
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,283
and his team to the airport tomorrow.

17
00:01:02,398 --> 00:01:03,685
Sure that's early enough?

18
00:01:03,779 --> 00:01:05,825
Wouldn't want them
to miss their flight home.

19
00:01:06,311 --> 00:01:08,086
More than enough.

20
00:01:08,141 --> 00:01:10,892
It's so very red.

21
00:01:13,207 --> 00:01:17,398
It was the only shade that was able
to completely cover the blood stains.

22
00:01:18,326 --> 00:01:20,814
There was a lot of blood.

23
00:01:35,481 --> 00:01:37,762
I knew I shouldn't
have bought it on e-bay.

24
00:01:48,904 --> 00:01:50,559
No, darlin' it's not like that.

25
00:01:50,812 --> 00:01:53,111
Of course I want you
to come and visit, it's just...

26
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:55,251
that if I give my contact
information to anyone...

27
00:01:55,286 --> 00:01:58,311
it might jeopardize the safety
of those orphans being held captive.

28
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:02,014
Orphans? You said their parents
were worried about them.

29
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:06,235
Their soon-to-be parents who just
selected those kids for adoption.

30
00:02:06,787 --> 00:02:09,146
God, they must be frantic right now.

31
00:02:09,607 --> 00:02:12,921
That's why it's so important
I go in undercover to help find them.

32
00:02:14,945 --> 00:02:16,808
Be careful, Connor.

33
00:02:17,014 --> 00:02:19,444
Oh, darlin', oh yeah, I will.

34
00:02:19,929 --> 00:02:21,549
Wish me luck.

35
00:02:21,592 --> 00:02:23,112
Try it again.

36
00:02:23,197 --> 00:02:26,336
Boss, I've hit it a dozen
times in the last half hour.

37
00:02:26,499 --> 00:02:29,803
I can't even get Morgan's office on the
emergency channel. Everything is shut down.

38
00:02:29,957 --> 00:02:31,697
Could it be a satellite problem?

39
00:02:32,188 --> 00:02:35,976
No, if it was, there's a dozen others
they could piggyback on to.

40
00:02:36,047 --> 00:02:38,334
I sent him that message two days ago.

41
00:02:39,412 --> 00:02:41,476
All right, put me through to his house.

42
00:02:47,472 --> 00:02:49,760
CONNECTING...

43
00:02:50,346 --> 00:02:53,738
We're sorry, the number you
have reached is not in service.

44
00:02:57,873 --> 00:02:59,900
Try Rio-six-two.

45
00:03:00,461 --> 00:03:01,344
Boss,

46
00:03:01,345 --> 00:03:03,811
- ... that's for catastrophic events only.
- I know what it's for, Riley.

47
00:03:03,874 --> 00:03:06,618
Rio-six-two, do it!

48
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:16,433
Emergency communications,
what's your department code?

49
00:03:16,472 --> 00:03:18,050
One-seven-three-six.

50
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,430
Did you say, one-seven-three-six?

51
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:24,206
That's correct, one-seven-three-six.

52
00:03:24,584 --> 00:03:27,134
That's a non-functioning code.

53
00:03:28,856 --> 00:03:30,294
That's impossible.

54
00:03:30,295 --> 00:03:32,902
That code registers non-functional.

55
00:03:33,052 --> 00:03:37,338
This is special agent Andre McBride, put
me through to Gerald Morgan, immediately!

56
00:03:37,873 --> 00:03:41,369
We have no one by that name
on our personnel roster.

57
00:03:44,061 --> 00:03:47,760
All right, Riley, you try to reach him,
use everything in your bag of tricks.

58
00:03:47,904 --> 00:03:50,464
I'm going to talk to Hamilton,
see what he knows.

59
00:05:42,948 --> 00:05:44,518
Boss, what the
hell is going on down there?!

60
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:49,231
Riley, override security and lock
the facility down now! High alert!

61
00:06:04,422 --> 00:06:06,976
Someone's trying to take out
the whole operation.

62
00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:25,697
This is it, Riley, we're going to war.

63
00:06:32,008 --> 00:06:36,608
PAINKILLER JANE 1x22 ENDGAME
Subtitles subXpacio and TusSeries

64
00:06:37,084 --> 00:06:40,687
Main power is gone.
We're on emergency back up.

65
00:06:41,702 --> 00:06:44,027
No, this is not a communications
problem with Washington.

66
00:06:44,062 --> 00:06:46,012
Morgan's not even on the roster.

67
00:06:46,609 --> 00:06:49,214
Whoever's did this,
they planned it well.

68
00:06:49,237 --> 00:06:51,485
- Is captain Rawlings...
- He's on his way down.

69
00:06:51,688 --> 00:06:53,163
Ok, got 'em boss.

70
00:06:53,184 --> 00:06:56,734
Connor's in an elevator and Jane's
in a stairwell at the northeast sector.

71
00:07:01,024 --> 00:07:04,220
- They're conferenced.
- All right, people, talk to me.

72
00:07:04,953 --> 00:07:08,556
Little problem with a locked door.
Working on it.

73
00:07:09,036 --> 00:07:11,052
Stuck between floors, darlin',
wanna trade?

74
00:07:11,147 --> 00:07:14,213
I want both of you get back to the
command center ASAP. We have a situation.

75
00:07:14,302 --> 00:07:16,021
Tell me about it.

76
00:07:16,499 --> 00:07:20,386
Exits all secured. No one's entered or
left the facility in the past three hours.

77
00:07:20,445 --> 00:07:24,089
- Was anyone seen near Hamilton's office?
- Nearest camera's fifteen meters down.

78
00:07:24,176 --> 00:07:26,379
Didn't show anyone except
who we found at the scene.

79
00:07:26,397 --> 00:07:29,476
But there's two hallways leading
to the area that aren't monitored.

80
00:07:29,501 --> 00:07:32,722
All right, cordon all detainees in
a secured area and get me a head count.

81
00:08:02,302 --> 00:08:05,925
- Guys, this is not good.
- What is it?

82
00:08:06,218 --> 00:08:09,161
When the power surged, it blew
the electronics in red sector.

83
00:08:09,398 --> 00:08:11,893
We got at least four cell locks
that were disengaged.

84
00:08:11,928 --> 00:08:13,801
- Red sector's the...
- I know what red sector is!

85
00:08:13,825 --> 00:08:14,984
Get me Rawlings.

86
00:08:16,007 --> 00:08:18,782
Captain Rawlings, this is McBride,
I've just been informed there is been...

87
00:08:18,817 --> 00:08:21,539
a security breech in red sector
that's red sector,

88
00:08:21,603 --> 00:08:24,831
all available personnel
there immediately.

89
00:09:11,227 --> 00:09:12,957
Freeze!

90
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,137
I've got Jane.

91
00:09:48,585 --> 00:09:51,138
- Jane, go.
- I'm out of the stairwell.

92
00:09:51,388 --> 00:09:53,291
What's the quickest way back?

93
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,926
Ok, go right at the next T.

94
00:09:56,033 --> 00:09:58,671
You should be able to access a
utility ladder about ten yards down...

95
00:09:58,706 --> 00:10:00,333
and get up to level four.

96
00:10:00,605 --> 00:10:02,014
- Comm me when you get there.
- Jane...

97
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:05,378
We've had a security breech in red sector.
I don't know if anyone got out.

98
00:10:05,447 --> 00:10:07,692
Just be careful.

99
00:10:08,162 --> 00:10:09,924
Got it.

100
00:10:29,522 --> 00:10:33,150
Oh, that sucked!
All right, Riley, talk to me.

101
00:10:33,214 --> 00:10:34,944
Connor, where are you?

102
00:10:36,013 --> 00:10:38,243
Third level, quadrant seven.

103
00:10:38,264 --> 00:10:40,460
Quadrant seven?

104
00:10:41,524 --> 00:10:45,463
Boss, there's a sub-panel
just around the corner.

105
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:48,097
He might be able to activate
an overload and regain full power.

106
00:10:48,131 --> 00:10:49,140
Do it.

107
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,173
Connor, head for the labs
at the end of hall.

108
00:10:51,261 --> 00:10:53,321
There's a power
sub-panel in the wall.

109
00:10:53,481 --> 00:10:55,255
We might be able to get
some power back on.

110
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,479
Right, roger that.

111
00:10:59,857 --> 00:11:01,439
All right.

112
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:07,834
All right, I'm here.

113
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,703
Ok, you'll see two yellow switches
about a third of the way down,

114
00:11:10,819 --> 00:11:12,830
the circuit overload should've
pushed them to the left,

115
00:11:12,947 --> 00:11:14,856
you need to reset them.

116
00:11:17,144 --> 00:11:18,401
Done.

117
00:11:19,402 --> 00:11:21,294
On top you'll see a numbered dial.

118
00:11:21,329 --> 00:11:24,542
Turn it clockwise until
the indicator lines up at 450.

119
00:11:32,323 --> 00:11:36,250
- 450 done and done.
- To the left you'll see a red lever.

120
00:11:36,925 --> 00:11:39,142
Pull it up, and then back down.

121
00:11:43,772 --> 00:11:47,268
Now we're done like dinner!
Got any other plans, Einstein?

122
00:11:48,058 --> 00:11:51,133
Whoever cut the power must have
damaged the systems at the mains.

123
00:11:51,852 --> 00:11:54,629
- They're in the sub-basement.
- Just tell me how to get there.

124
00:11:55,496 --> 00:11:59,034
That's too risky. We've got potential
escapees from red sector.

125
00:11:59,163 --> 00:12:01,222
Get your ass back here.

126
00:12:03,203 --> 00:12:05,247
I'm on level four, B-ward.

127
00:12:06,603 --> 00:12:10,318
Head to the fire doors. They're probably
locked, but there is windows.

128
00:12:10,342 --> 00:12:11,599
On it.

129
00:13:52,051 --> 00:13:53,539
Come on!

130
00:13:53,674 --> 00:13:56,704
Come on,
you sons of bitches!

131
00:14:07,961 --> 00:14:09,775
That doesn't make any sense.

132
00:14:10,025 --> 00:14:13,172
It's just a supply area, and
those doors wouldn't lock down,

133
00:14:13,933 --> 00:14:16,400
they're not even part of
the emergency system.

134
00:14:19,446 --> 00:14:21,004
I don't know what to tell you, Ri.

135
00:14:21,273 --> 00:14:24,326
If they're not supposed to lock,
someone must've forgotten to tell them.

136
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:28,022
No need for sarcasm, maybe
I just made a little mistake.

137
00:14:29,297 --> 00:14:31,484
- Hey, wait a second.
- What is it?

138
00:14:32,254 --> 00:14:34,472
"It" is you eating your words.

139
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,753
You're on the wrong floor, Jane!

140
00:14:36,908 --> 00:14:38,529
What?

141
00:14:40,931 --> 00:14:43,002
- Still can't get her.
- Just keep trying.

142
00:14:44,722 --> 00:14:46,040
Report.

143
00:14:46,075 --> 00:14:49,755
Don't worry about me, boss. I don't
heal as fast as Vasco, but I'll be okay.

144
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:52,613
Your theory about red sector
escapees ain't a theory.

145
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,158
- They're packing.
- How many?

146
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,385
There was four,
now there's three.

147
00:14:56,568 --> 00:14:58,530
Vasco get back yet?

148
00:14:58,694 --> 00:15:01,914
She was on the wrong floor and
we lost connection with her comm.

149
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,542
We've unaccounted for
red sector detainees.

150
00:15:04,569 --> 00:15:06,991
- Yes, we know captain.
- They killed three of my men at the ward.

151
00:15:07,026 --> 00:15:10,294
- Another two on level 3.
- We lost Jane on level 3.

152
00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:11,655
What about the rest of the population?

153
00:15:11,704 --> 00:15:13,919
Everyone accounted for
except a couple of trustees.

154
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:16,283
- How many men can you spare?
- Two would be stretching it.

155
00:15:16,336 --> 00:15:18,376
Then stretch it!
We'll do a grid search.

156
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,094
Connor, you and I will make
our way down from here.

157
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,516
Take your men down to ground level
Start there.

158
00:15:22,551 --> 00:15:24,809
Boss, guns.

159
00:15:26,174 --> 00:15:27,843
Guns.

160
00:15:48,871 --> 00:15:50,696
Dead?

161
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:57,731
Be better off if they were.

162
00:16:01,223 --> 00:16:04,813
- Julien Ellison.
- Had the power to make people catatonic.

163
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:08,022
- Don't shoot!
- Freeze!

164
00:16:08,614 --> 00:16:10,677
Slowly hands in the air.

165
00:16:12,525 --> 00:16:14,552
I didn't do it.

166
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,831
Eddie, what the hell are you doing here?

167
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:19,990
I'm a trustee.
I was cleaning up when he came in.

168
00:16:20,182 --> 00:16:22,826
- He just froze them.
- We can't trust this freak.

169
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:25,726
It's all right, a guy with this kind
of power if he wanted us dead,

170
00:16:25,761 --> 00:16:27,605
we'd be dead already.

171
00:16:27,979 --> 00:16:29,597
So, how come you aren't comatose, Eddie?

172
00:16:29,696 --> 00:16:32,373
I didn't bother to ask,
if you know what I mean.

173
00:16:32,713 --> 00:16:35,229
All right, get back to your ward.
Go on.

174
00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:45,477
Doesn't make sense. Guys in
lockdown don't do trustees favors.

175
00:16:46,223 --> 00:16:48,179
It fits the pattern.

176
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:51,688
They're taking out staff,
not other Neuros.

177
00:17:33,846 --> 00:17:35,700
Clear!

178
00:18:05,772 --> 00:18:08,065
Fire broke out in the records room.

179
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,399
Sprinklers were activated,
but the temp's still rising.

180
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:11,557
Rawlings?

181
00:18:11,645 --> 00:18:14,067
I've lost communications.
It was sudden, just like Jane.

182
00:18:14,542 --> 00:18:18,797
Doctor, your predecessor ran unauthorized
experiments on some of the population, yes?

183
00:18:18,991 --> 00:18:20,920
- That's correct.
- Did he un-chip them?

184
00:18:20,977 --> 00:18:24,510
The experiments would've required
him to do that. Temporarily.

185
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:27,652
The Neuros on the loose
must have been involved.

186
00:18:27,769 --> 00:18:29,547
Taking out the staff,
destroying records.

187
00:18:29,601 --> 00:18:31,657
They're trying to wipe out any
evidence of our existence.

188
00:18:31,756 --> 00:18:33,918
And yet they didn't touch a trustee.

189
00:18:35,277 --> 00:18:37,051
Because he's a Neuro.

190
00:18:37,086 --> 00:18:39,471
Whoever's behind this,
they're planning on sending...

191
00:18:39,626 --> 00:18:42,065
every Neuro we've ever
captured back into the world.

192
00:18:43,346 --> 00:18:45,909
- We aren't secure here.
- We aren't secure anywhere.

193
00:18:45,965 --> 00:18:49,808
We are in the safe room.
It's on level two, blue sector.

194
00:18:49,865 --> 00:18:54,436
She's right. Got an ultrasonic barrier that
deflects every neuro-ability we know of.

195
00:18:55,149 --> 00:18:58,030
Connor, get our weapons ready.
Riley, pack up your computer.

196
00:18:58,188 --> 00:18:59,974
Dr. Newman, with me.

197
00:19:09,653 --> 00:19:11,146
Clear.

198
00:19:46,622 --> 00:19:48,543
Okay, guys, I've got Jane!

199
00:19:48,756 --> 00:19:51,136
We've got escaped
Neuros from red sector.

200
00:19:51,225 --> 00:19:53,866
- I know, I'm headed your way.
- No, Jane, we've moved.

201
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,909
We're on a safe room on level 2.

202
00:19:56,052 --> 00:19:58,951
- Where are you now?
- Near the kitchen area on three.

203
00:19:59,077 --> 00:20:00,169
How do I get there?

204
00:20:00,256 --> 00:20:02,457
I'm gonna try to open up
a stairway east of you.

205
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:05,373
If that's jammed, use the kitchen
stairs down to storage.

206
00:20:05,528 --> 00:20:08,233
You'll have to double-back
to the B-ward east door,

207
00:20:08,325 --> 00:20:10,041
then head straight and around the corner.

208
00:20:10,233 --> 00:20:12,229
- Copy that.
- Jane.

209
00:20:12,642 --> 00:20:14,926
The door is secured
and the barrier is activated.

210
00:20:15,156 --> 00:20:17,008
I need to know when you're
close. I only want it open...

211
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:18,760
for as long as it takes
for you to get inside.

212
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,400
Understood.

213
00:20:23,579 --> 00:20:27,533
Okay, Jane, you're close. Head left
and you'll see the safe room door.

214
00:20:34,605 --> 00:20:36,300
I see it now.

215
00:20:37,332 --> 00:20:38,740
Go.

216
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:56,583
Jane, hurry they're right behind you!

217
00:21:09,147 --> 00:21:11,234
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

218
00:21:12,081 --> 00:21:13,757
No, Riley,

219
00:21:14,364 --> 00:21:16,321
- What are you doing?!
- Riley, what the hell are you doing?!

220
00:21:16,356 --> 00:21:18,377
She's lying!
- Open the door!

221
00:21:18,383 --> 00:21:20,484
- She's...
- Open the damn door!

222
00:21:20,507 --> 00:21:22,544
She's got red
paint on her, okay!

223
00:21:22,579 --> 00:21:24,955
It's the same paint that
Hamilton's office was being painted!

224
00:21:25,116 --> 00:21:27,062
She never reported being
anywhere near there!

225
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,411
- Hurry up Riley!
- She's lying. We've got proof.

226
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:31,335
Open the door!

227
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:33,729
Show me that proof now, Riley!

228
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:56,623
If they wanted you dead,
you'd be dead already!

229
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:02,765
She's been lying the whole time, boss.

230
00:22:13,574 --> 00:22:15,741
You'll all be dead soon enough!

231
00:22:27,226 --> 00:22:29,304
And how are we going to get in?

232
00:22:29,404 --> 00:22:32,715
We won't have to. Connor
and Andre will come after us.

233
00:22:32,802 --> 00:22:35,272
What's the status of
the yellow and green sectors?

234
00:22:35,411 --> 00:22:37,952
They corralled the residents
into the ding hall on blue.

235
00:22:38,102 --> 00:22:41,785
Only two guards on post. Everyone
in yellow is locked in the day room.

236
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:45,613
The guard stationed there was one of
the ones we toasted in the records room.

237
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:49,410
And we still have two dozen techs and
administrative workers to take care of.

238
00:22:49,466 --> 00:22:53,052
They're unarmed and untrained.
Should be an easy sweep.

239
00:22:53,116 --> 00:22:56,969
- And we'll free the wards.
- And then what, just walk out?

240
00:22:57,197 --> 00:23:00,887
No. Trucks will arrive
at the main gate at 0700.

241
00:23:00,956 --> 00:23:03,907
- We'll get everybody on board.
- And then where do we go?

242
00:23:04,058 --> 00:23:07,609
We've made arrangements for everyone
to be flown back to the States.

243
00:23:07,869 --> 00:23:09,889
Without a team to hunt us down,

244
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,517
- ... we'll be able to...
- Get back to doing what we do best.

245
00:23:12,606 --> 00:23:14,313
- Yes.
- Something like that.

246
00:23:14,406 --> 00:23:17,495
Doesn't leave us a lot
of time and we're one man down.

247
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,756
We could get more help from red sector.

248
00:23:28,174 --> 00:23:30,542
I had a bad feeling about
that broad from the beginning.

249
00:23:30,662 --> 00:23:34,533
No, there's got to be a reason
why she's doing this.

250
00:23:35,073 --> 00:23:38,196
I don't give a damn why
she's doing it, Riley,

251
00:23:38,693 --> 00:23:40,661
she has to be stopped.

252
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:46,563
- Like with a tranquilizer.
- No, not with a tranquilizer.

253
00:23:58,689 --> 00:24:00,945
We're going to have to kill Jane.

254
00:24:03,838 --> 00:24:05,842
How do you kill someone who can't die?

255
00:24:05,894 --> 00:24:08,935
- What do you mean, "can't die"?
- She can heal from any injury.

256
00:24:09,044 --> 00:24:14,137
She and Baumgartner, they have a lot
in common. He has the same capability.

257
00:24:14,198 --> 00:24:15,950
But Jane can't change her image.

258
00:24:15,988 --> 00:24:19,381
It's just a variation of his ability
to regenerate his cell structure...

259
00:24:19,451 --> 00:24:21,682
He always returns to his
original form, and...

260
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,701
and we've noticed he's been able to
heal from small injuries very quickly.

261
00:24:25,824 --> 00:24:28,387
Have you any DNA records of agent Vasco's?

262
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:39,285
The patterns are identical.

263
00:24:39,597 --> 00:24:42,002
It's possible she's not
acting on her own will.

264
00:24:42,021 --> 00:24:45,690
- What the hell does that mean?
- Baumgartner was always a unique case.

265
00:24:45,725 --> 00:24:48,558
His DNA pattern wasn't like the
other Neuros. It was similar,

266
00:24:48,693 --> 00:24:50,686
but there were significant differences.

267
00:24:50,747 --> 00:24:51,884
Like Jane.

268
00:24:51,913 --> 00:24:54,761
We've studied his cerebral
pattern extensively.

269
00:24:54,886 --> 00:24:58,469
We found that a region of his
brain is unusually overdeveloped;

270
00:24:58,589 --> 00:25:02,280
a region that makes him highly
susceptible to suggestion.

271
00:25:03,737 --> 00:25:08,481
Jane's pattern shows a similarly
overdeveloped region in her brain.

272
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:10,817
Who's the sonofabitch
doing the controlling?

273
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:12,677
No idea.

274
00:25:12,843 --> 00:25:17,070
So, then what? Wave a watch in front of
her face and she'll stop what she's doing.

275
00:25:17,466 --> 00:25:20,690
Preliminary research indicates that
something like that might be a possibility,

276
00:25:20,774 --> 00:25:22,827
but at this point, it's just a theory.

277
00:25:22,862 --> 00:25:26,151
I am sick and tired of theories.

278
00:25:26,677 --> 00:25:29,564
Right now we're under assault
and Jane's leading the charge.

279
00:25:29,581 --> 00:25:30,708
But boss...

280
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:33,068
We've seen her take hits to the body...

281
00:25:33,595 --> 00:25:35,198
but there's got to be a limit.

282
00:25:35,263 --> 00:25:37,110
We got enough firepower to the right area,

283
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:39,198
there's got to be something
that she can't heal from.

284
00:25:39,228 --> 00:25:41,468
Yeah, maybe, but
the problem's access.

285
00:25:41,715 --> 00:25:44,339
She's got three unchipped
neuroid freaks with her.

286
00:25:44,407 --> 00:25:46,142
Chances are
won't leave home without them.

287
00:25:46,251 --> 00:25:48,420
Then we'll have to beat them
at their own game.

288
00:25:58,453 --> 00:26:00,309
March!

289
00:26:14,255 --> 00:26:16,303
Go, go, go!

290
00:26:18,611 --> 00:26:20,637
Go, go, go!

291
00:26:21,849 --> 00:26:23,845
We got a problem, boss.

292
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:29,118
Yellow sector, door to the sub-perimeter.

293
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:32,515
Riley, NICO remains under lockdown. If you
want you can get one of Rawlings men...

294
00:26:32,606 --> 00:26:34,908
Boss, we don't have time!

295
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:38,309
Ok? They're in trouble!
This guy, he's red sector.

296
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,668
It stays locked.

297
00:26:39,722 --> 00:26:42,170
- Those are my people down there.
- They're my people too, doctor!

298
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:45,114
That gate leads to the sub-perimeter. They
could easily get to the outside world!

299
00:26:45,173 --> 00:26:47,084
- You could open it quickly!
- I can't take risk!

300
00:26:47,174 --> 00:26:49,742
- They're going to die!
- Not if we get there first!

301
00:26:49,903 --> 00:26:53,195
Thank you. Riley, you keep that locked!

302
00:27:22,672 --> 00:27:24,340
Very Rambo.

303
00:27:24,888 --> 00:27:28,070
Pretty tough to heal from
200 rounds of hollowpoint, Jane.

304
00:27:28,163 --> 00:27:32,297
Just long enough to grab your cute little
traitor ass and throw it in lockdown.

305
00:27:33,933 --> 00:27:36,082
There's just one problem
with your plan...

306
00:27:38,343 --> 00:27:40,551
I don't work alone.

307
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,917
Now, what we're...

308
00:28:27,678 --> 00:28:29,752
We don't work
alone either.

309
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,837
Riley, open the door!

310
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:59,597
Right, the people at that
gate are safe for now.

311
00:28:59,662 --> 00:29:02,084
The same can't be said for Jane's
freak crew, she's on her own now.

312
00:29:02,146 --> 00:29:03,291
So that's good news.

313
00:29:03,321 --> 00:29:06,146
Yeah, maybe, but there's nothing to say
she won't spring more playmates from hell.

314
00:29:06,209 --> 00:29:08,129
That's probably the first
thing she's going to do.

315
00:29:08,295 --> 00:29:11,385
I think I got Jane, but it's
a pretty good bet given the location.

316
00:29:11,596 --> 00:29:14,744
- She's headed to red sector.
- We may not be so lucky next time.

317
00:29:14,783 --> 00:29:16,566
I'd like to think there's
a little skill was involved.

318
00:29:16,601 --> 00:29:17,993
- We have to stop her.
- How can we do that...

319
00:29:18,016 --> 00:29:20,767
- ... if she heals from gunshots?
- We don't use guns.

320
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:24,296
Riley, remember those explosives we used
to blow the tunnel, we still got any?

321
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:27,058
Yeah, there's enough chemicals and
supplies to whip something up, but...

322
00:29:27,138 --> 00:29:29,230
- ... they're a couple levels down.
- If we can get our hands on it,

323
00:29:29,365 --> 00:29:31,807
I can rig up something that
no one's going to walk away from.

324
00:29:32,275 --> 00:29:34,281
- Not even Jane.
- How long will it take?

325
00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:35,890
About half an hour.

326
00:29:36,282 --> 00:29:37,887
What's Jane's position?

327
00:29:38,007 --> 00:29:41,050
- She'll be back in red sector by then.
- Can you do anything about that?

328
00:29:41,253 --> 00:29:44,239
I can't cut her off completely, but
I can sure as hell slow her down.

329
00:29:44,296 --> 00:29:45,891
Then what are you waiting for?

330
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,033
I you see so much as
a cockroach out there,

331
00:29:48,134 --> 00:29:50,382
shoot the hell out of it
and don't stop moving.

332
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,671
My pleasure.

333
00:30:27,113 --> 00:30:28,659
Riley.

334
00:30:36,803 --> 00:30:38,942
Just for that...

335
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,900
I'm going to save you for last.

336
00:32:18,486 --> 00:32:20,370
Come on Riley, where is she?

337
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:22,728
- In the vents.
- Where in the vents!

338
00:32:22,791 --> 00:32:24,974
I have do idea! I mean, whoever built
this place didn't have the foresight...

339
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,972
to install security cameras
in the air ducts!

340
00:32:29,991 --> 00:32:32,471
That was the last one.
We're ready.

341
00:32:32,494 --> 00:32:33,801
Ready?

342
00:32:33,934 --> 00:32:36,396
Where the hell are we going to
use it if we can't find Jane?!

343
00:32:36,427 --> 00:32:38,168
Get her to find me.

344
00:32:38,235 --> 00:32:41,143
Look, she'll come out in the open
if she thinks she has a clear shot.

345
00:32:41,198 --> 00:32:44,279
How are you planning to detonate
that without destroying yourself?

346
00:32:46,058 --> 00:32:47,710
There's no other way.

347
00:32:48,581 --> 00:32:50,275
Maybe there is.

348
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:54,508
I've been helping Dr. Newman access
NICO's research database.

349
00:32:54,631 --> 00:32:57,983
Our experiments were unsuccessful
with electrical stimulation...

350
00:32:58,032 --> 00:33:02,209
to the control portion of Baumgartner's
brain I was telling you about.

351
00:33:02,266 --> 00:33:07,379
I discovered a convergence of synapses
from the optical nerve and this node.

352
00:33:07,465 --> 00:33:09,957
Great! Can we get someone in here
to explain that in Hungarian...

353
00:33:10,092 --> 00:33:13,110
- ... so we understand it better?
- Ok, for the Neanderthal's among us,

354
00:33:13,245 --> 00:33:16,264
there's a direct connection between
the eye and the control center.

355
00:33:16,324 --> 00:33:18,565
And there's probably a reason for that.

356
00:33:18,861 --> 00:33:21,740
And it's possible the control node is
activated by some kind of light source.

357
00:33:21,901 --> 00:33:26,152
That would explain why direct electrical
stimulation didn't have any effect.

358
00:33:26,201 --> 00:33:29,231
If we could hit that optical nerve
with a high frequency spectrum,

359
00:33:29,898 --> 00:33:32,511
- ... it might be able to break the control.
- And how do you intend to do that?

360
00:33:32,564 --> 00:33:33,895
With this.

361
00:33:38,935 --> 00:33:41,045
You don't see anything because
you don't have the condition.

362
00:33:41,205 --> 00:33:44,691
But to someone like Jane who does, it'll
look like the 4th of July on steroids.

363
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,522
In theory, she'll go out like a light.

364
00:33:48,946 --> 00:33:50,771
- It's worth a shot.
- Yeah.

365
00:33:50,806 --> 00:33:53,280
And if doesn't work, I'm dead
and you're all not far behind.

366
00:33:53,343 --> 00:33:55,828
No. I'll take the explosives as a back up.

367
00:33:58,121 --> 00:34:01,237
I'm the team leader,
I recruited Jane,

368
00:34:01,304 --> 00:34:02,849
- ... this is my responsibility.
- No, no, no!

369
00:34:02,852 --> 00:34:04,267
I'm the one with demo experience.

370
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:06,460
It doesn't take an expert
to push a button.

371
00:34:06,517 --> 00:34:09,199
It does to reconnect
a bad lead on the fly.

372
00:34:14,634 --> 00:34:16,365
We'll draw straws.

373
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:39,293
- Looks like it's my lucky day.
- Yeah, guess it is.

374
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,112
She's close, boss.

375
00:35:14,521 --> 00:35:16,108
Jane!

376
00:35:20,323 --> 00:35:22,251
Jane, you're being controlled!

377
00:35:24,009 --> 00:35:26,700
Someone's using you as a pawn.

378
00:35:27,817 --> 00:35:30,400
There's a part of your brain
that's been programmed!

379
00:35:37,003 --> 00:35:38,724
But that's just like you, isn't it?

380
00:35:40,212 --> 00:35:42,391
Always pretending
to be the rebel,

381
00:35:43,278 --> 00:35:45,376
but all you end up doing in the end...

382
00:35:46,871 --> 00:35:48,955
is following orders.

383
00:35:50,317 --> 00:35:53,492
Haven't exactly been
following yours, have I?

384
00:35:59,075 --> 00:36:02,345
Then again you won't be
giving any when you're dead.

385
00:36:02,431 --> 00:36:04,058
Now Riley.

386
00:36:18,555 --> 00:36:20,687
Taking one for the team?

387
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:24,564
You were once a part of
that team, Jane.

388
00:36:27,042 --> 00:36:29,544
Either you will be again,

389
00:36:30,291 --> 00:36:33,202
or this all ends right here.

390
00:36:45,035 --> 00:36:46,699
This is bad.

391
00:36:54,896 --> 00:36:56,762
Don't make me do this.

392
00:37:28,752 --> 00:37:33,198
While you were on vacation,
I tracked down Roberts to Vonotek.

393
00:37:33,221 --> 00:37:34,862
The chairman.

394
00:37:34,991 --> 00:37:36,991
He started it all.

395
00:37:37,448 --> 00:37:40,108
He created Neuros.

396
00:37:43,852 --> 00:37:45,558
He created me.

397
00:37:46,047 --> 00:37:48,328
I'm part of a second generation.

398
00:37:48,743 --> 00:37:51,186
Neuro 2.0 now perfected.

399
00:37:56,667 --> 00:38:00,318
It felt like killing you,

400
00:38:00,899 --> 00:38:03,619
Connor and Riley,

401
00:38:05,029 --> 00:38:07,559
betraying Brian...

402
00:38:09,341 --> 00:38:11,980
and trying to take over NICO was...

403
00:38:13,315 --> 00:38:16,144
was something I wanted to do.

404
00:38:17,457 --> 00:38:19,500
I'm a monster.

405
00:38:21,662 --> 00:38:24,410
Leave me here.
You have to leave me here,

406
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:28,868
find a way to chip me,
let them experiment.

407
00:38:28,919 --> 00:38:30,940
That won't be necessary.

408
00:38:31,427 --> 00:38:33,569
The light pattern worked.

409
00:38:33,986 --> 00:38:37,559
The synaptic activity at
the control node has shifted,

410
00:38:37,694 --> 00:38:39,874
the node itself has shrunk.

411
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:43,015
Do you understand?
You were being controlled.

412
00:38:44,152 --> 00:38:46,715
There's a part of your brain that's
highly susceptible to command.

413
00:38:46,994 --> 00:38:49,481
Roberts was able to access that
using a high spectrum light.

414
00:38:49,574 --> 00:38:51,537
None of this is your fault.

415
00:38:52,007 --> 00:38:54,467
- He's a dead man.
- Right now,

416
00:38:55,102 --> 00:38:58,690
you are more valuable to this team
than you have ever been.

417
00:39:02,619 --> 00:39:04,620
This is a micro-bug.

418
00:39:04,657 --> 00:39:08,112
Roberts had it put in.
He could hear everything you could.

419
00:39:08,802 --> 00:39:11,894
All Roberts knows is his
destruction of NICO failed.

420
00:39:11,954 --> 00:39:15,016
He does not know that you're
no longer under his control.

421
00:39:15,175 --> 00:39:16,958
It turns the chip
on and off.

422
00:39:17,049 --> 00:39:20,141
You can decide when Roberts
listens in or when he doesn't.

423
00:39:21,593 --> 00:39:23,912
You're a double agent now, Jane.

424
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,868
We don't know how Roberts
runs his organization,

425
00:39:29,526 --> 00:39:33,976
but with your help we will.

426
00:39:44,625 --> 00:39:48,113
Waking up on that table was like
some kind of "Wizard of Oz" from hell.

427
00:39:48,237 --> 00:39:50,261
That would make me the cowardly lion.

428
00:39:51,001 --> 00:39:53,173
And Andre the heartless tin man.

429
00:39:54,075 --> 00:39:56,089
No brainer, I'm the scarecrow.

430
00:40:15,802 --> 00:40:20,312
Truth be told, Riley actually has
as much courage as anyone on the team,

431
00:40:20,947 --> 00:40:25,912
and Andre, even though he doesn't like
to show it, has one of the biggest hearts.

432
00:40:25,944 --> 00:40:28,342
And I've even gotta admit
that Connor can come up...

433
00:40:28,363 --> 00:40:31,541
with a pretty damn brilliant
idea every once in a while.

434
00:40:31,633 --> 00:40:33,701
Not that I'll ever tell him.

435
00:40:34,419 --> 00:40:36,647
I'd do anything to protect this team.

436
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:41,065
And now that I'm a double agent,
we just might have a chance...

437
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:44,382
at stopping Roberts
from whatever he's up to.

438
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:23,309
I knew she wouldn't make it.

439
00:41:27,287 --> 00:41:28,830
He's going to kill you.

440
00:41:28,867 --> 00:41:31,173
- We all have our problems.
- Neuros tagged and bagged, boss.

441
00:41:31,332 --> 00:41:33,881
This work is unlike
any work you've done before.

442
00:41:34,243 --> 00:41:35,979
I call the shots in my life,
agent McBride.

443
00:41:36,072 --> 00:41:37,988
Your entire service
record has been red flagged.

444
00:41:38,068 --> 00:41:39,417
What the hell is going on!

445
00:41:39,942 --> 00:41:40,845
We hunt Neuros.

446
00:41:40,871 --> 00:41:43,191
A dozen deaths
traced directly to Vonotek.

447
00:41:43,728 --> 00:41:45,370
He's on the express elevator.

448
00:42:06,442 --> 00:42:08,258
You wanted to see me, sir.

449
00:42:08,548 --> 00:42:10,214
Pre-sales figures.

450
00:42:10,844 --> 00:42:14,055
We have orders from 90 percent of
targeted stores throughout the country...

451
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:15,968
including every major chain.

452
00:42:16,165 --> 00:42:17,397
That's great news.

453
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:20,148
Looks like retailers are betting
that Vonotek's new product...

454
00:42:20,583 --> 00:42:23,717
will be every bit as successful
as our pharmaceuticals.

455
00:42:24,034 --> 00:42:27,173
Why wouldn't they? We're the
most trusted company in the world.

456
00:42:27,258 --> 00:42:29,234
If we're going
to meet the demand,

457
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:31,659
and I intend to,

458
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,997
we're gonna have to increase production
and expand distribution.

459
00:42:36,075 --> 00:42:38,423
Which means increasing security.

460
00:42:38,458 --> 00:42:40,301
We've got to keep
our "secret sauce" secret.

461
00:42:40,354 --> 00:42:42,451
- I understand.
- In this case,

462
00:42:42,586 --> 00:42:44,948
what people don't know will help them.

463
00:42:45,242 --> 00:42:47,723
Just think Randall
in approximately four months...

464
00:42:48,476 --> 00:42:51,229
the world will begin to experience
the amazing benefits...

465
00:42:51,264 --> 00:42:53,765
of neurological enhancement.

466
00:42:57,081 --> 00:42:59,588
That's what I call food for thought.
