1
00:00:00,758 --> 00:00:02,213
My name is Jane Vasco.

2
00:00:02,295 --> 00:00:03,617
I could use you on my team.

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:06,794
I work for a secret government agency
that hunts Neuros.

4
00:00:07,183 --> 00:00:10,339
People who can do dangerous
things with their minds.

5
00:00:11,373 --> 00:00:14,324
On my first assignement
something a little weird happen,

6
00:00:15,103 --> 00:00:17,890
Okay, something really weird

7
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,479
Until I get some answers,
I'm getting on with my life,

8
00:00:21,797 --> 00:00:23,160
doing my job,

9
00:00:23,488 --> 00:00:24,758
stocking up on aspirin,

10
00:00:25,352 --> 00:00:27,791
Because, I got to tell ya,

11
00:00:28,664 --> 00:00:30,140
pain's a bitch.

12
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:33,993
This is beautiful.

13
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,424
You like it?

14
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:37,992
Absolutely beautiful.

15
00:00:38,985 --> 00:00:40,576
She's just talking about
the tag, Riley !

16
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:41,498
I know !

17
00:00:42,226 --> 00:00:43,424
I love salamanders !

18
00:00:43,465 --> 00:00:45,945
It's not a salamader,
it's a chameleon.

19
00:00:46,304 --> 00:00:48,448
It's the underground cop
of the reptile world.

20
00:00:48,754 --> 00:00:50,170
Always blends in.

21
00:00:50,363 --> 00:00:51,391
Can't be pinned down.

22
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:52,591
It's perfect for you

23
00:00:53,446 --> 00:00:55,119
So what's gonna be for you, Lady?

24
00:00:56,085 --> 00:00:57,489
Maybe a puma.

25
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:58,810
Cunning, dangerous,

26
00:00:58,854 --> 00:01:00,725
Ever quite know, it's going on beyond nice

27
00:01:04,192 --> 00:01:05,945
Hey, I ain't got nothing for a while, thanks

28
00:01:06,849 --> 00:01:09,298
Hey, come on.
It would be great right in here, ya

29
00:01:09,421 --> 00:01:10,220
Right there.

30
00:01:10,282 --> 00:01:11,389
Yeah, but who?

31
00:01:12,362 --> 00:01:14,721
Ah no, I don't know, I'll pass, Thanks.

32
00:01:15,365 --> 00:01:16,903
Truly a shame.

33
00:01:17,066 --> 00:01:18,267
Now, you're telling me

34
00:01:18,348 --> 00:01:19,779
All right, so what do you think I should get?

35
00:01:20,112 --> 00:01:21,258
Right here

36
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,378
All around here

37
00:01:22,421 --> 00:01:25,820
Definitely not that hangover you're
gonna have tomorrow morning buddy

38
00:01:25,964 --> 00:01:27,179
We should heu...

39
00:01:27,226 --> 00:01:28,567
pack'in up!!

40
00:01:28,614 --> 00:01:31,193
No it's early, it's early, right?

41
00:01:31,284 --> 00:01:33,109
Seing, it's early !

42
00:01:33,261 --> 00:01:35,230
No, actually Mo, it's quite late.

43
00:01:36,036 --> 00:01:37,904
Why don't you, heu, paid him ?

44
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:40,975
Do you accept good "two it is" ?

45
00:01:41,103 --> 00:01:42,628
Never said no before !

46
00:01:44,226 --> 00:01:47,322
I think our friends has had a little bit too much to drink

47
00:01:47,394 --> 00:01:49,867
I dare say that yes !!

48
00:01:51,322 --> 00:01:52,132
Okay !

49
00:02:00,575 --> 00:02:03,195
Jane, that man is an artist.

50
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:06,463
And you're clearly
a patron of the arts.

51
00:02:06,558 --> 00:02:08,498
So, whatta you say?

52
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:10,486
The three of us?

53
00:02:11,272 --> 00:02:12,437
My place?

54
00:02:14,415 --> 00:02:16,866
One of us has
to take him home.

55
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:18,573
You girls could flip for it.

56
00:02:21,736 --> 00:02:22,827
That was easy.

57
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:28,480
C'mon ri,
get in the taxi.

58
00:02:30,046 --> 00:02:30,934
You coming?

59
00:02:31,905 --> 00:02:33,940
No, i've got a ride.

60
00:02:34,607 --> 00:02:36,096
Oh, right.

61
00:02:37,747 --> 00:02:38,811
C'mon cinderella.

62
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:39,994
We better get home,

63
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:42,011
before i turn
into a pumpkin.

64
00:02:42,741 --> 00:02:44,611
I think you passed
that critical line.

65
00:02:46,193 --> 00:02:48,126
So your place or mine?

66
00:02:48,172 --> 00:02:51,215
Ri, you are really
going to feel terrible
in the morning.

67
00:03:00,072 --> 00:03:02,883
Five more, Five more minutes.

68
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:20,301
{i}Dr. Pearson to
maternity,please Dr. Pearson

00:03:21,798 --> 00:03:22,529

00:03:23,961 --> 00:03:24,691
No!!

71
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:31,517
Hello?

72
00:03:32,455 --> 00:03:33,241
Hello?

73
00:03:33,741 --> 00:03:35,452
Is anybody here?!!!

74
00:03:36,275 --> 00:03:40,538
Transcript : swsub.com
Presync : IceFre@k

75
00:03:46,785 --> 00:03:47,765
Hospitals,

76
00:03:48,292 --> 00:03:51,142
not exactly one of the top ten
vacation destinations.

77
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:55,341
Sterile surroundings,
intimidating machines.

78
00:03:55,434 --> 00:03:58,841
And lab coated doctors
rattling off critical data...

79
00:03:58,904 --> 00:04:03,576
They make indigestion
sound like some flesh
ravaging disease.

80
00:04:04,385 --> 00:04:06,031
Then there's the worst part...

81
00:04:06,059 --> 00:04:07,160
The food.

82
00:04:08,713 --> 00:04:11,358
But the question of the day
isn't what's on the menu,

83
00:04:11,405 --> 00:04:14,562
but what the hell was
I doing here?

84
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,716
Hey, you're awake.

85
00:04:29,031 --> 00:04:30,279
Who are you?

86
00:04:30,344 --> 00:04:32,055
What happened?

87
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:33,821
Where am i?

88
00:04:33,849 --> 00:04:34,802
How did i get here?

89
00:04:34,848 --> 00:04:35,764
I'm shelly.

90
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:37,455
I'm your day nurse.

91
00:04:37,538 --> 00:04:38,546
You're in the hospital.

92
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:39,822
Why am i tied down?

93
00:04:39,868 --> 00:04:41,838
The doctor will
be in, in a minute.

94
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,364
Why can't you tell me what
the hell's going on.

95
00:04:43,882 --> 00:04:44,446
I'm sorry.

96
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:45,121
The doctor..

97
00:04:45,186 --> 00:04:46,481
No, no, please.

98
00:04:46,546 --> 00:04:47,295
You'll pul
your lines out.

99
00:04:47,322 --> 00:04:49,963
Take it easy,
just try and keep still.

100
00:04:50,027 --> 00:04:52,142
Okay, okay...

101
00:04:56,053 --> 00:04:58,042
It's for your
own safety, jane.

102
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:01,796
I'll take over,
thank you.

103
00:05:04,072 --> 00:05:05,844
I'm sorry about
the restraints.

104
00:05:05,881 --> 00:05:06,483
But last night...

105
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,018
What about last night?

106
00:05:10,496 --> 00:05:13,086
You don't remember anything
about last night?

107
00:05:14,618 --> 00:05:16,061
Of course i do.

108
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,206
I was out
with my friends.

109
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,231
I took riley home

110
00:05:22,851 --> 00:05:24,590
then i went home.

111
00:05:24,719 --> 00:05:26,819
At least i thought i did.

112
00:05:26,874 --> 00:05:28,100
That's all you remember?

113
00:05:28,174 --> 00:05:31,509
Well, clearly there's
something i can't rember.

114
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:35,042
So why don't you tell me
what's happening to me.

115
00:05:36,073 --> 00:05:36,896
I'm your doctor.

116
00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:38,394
Jakob baumgartner.

117
00:05:40,521 --> 00:05:41,797
As for your memory loss...

118
00:05:41,834 --> 00:05:43,518
Don't be too concerned.

119
00:05:43,615 --> 00:05:46,482
A certain amount of
memory loss is to be expected.

120
00:05:46,593 --> 00:05:48,276
To be expected from what?!

121
00:05:48,323 --> 00:05:50,357
Was in some kind
of accident?

122
00:05:50,468 --> 00:05:53,152
Some of the treatments
you've received have been..

123
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:54,216
Rigorous.

124
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:55,471
Treatments?

125
00:05:55,779 --> 00:05:57,046
How long have
i been in here?

126
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,344
Why don't we have
this conversation

127
00:05:58,398 --> 00:06:00,424
after the effects of
the sedatives have worn off.

128
00:06:00,498 --> 00:06:01,913
Why don't we have it now?

129
00:06:01,977 --> 00:06:04,201
Because i'd prefer that
you were clear and focused.

130
00:06:04,262 --> 00:06:05,412
And less agitated.

131
00:06:07,872 --> 00:06:09,361
We'll bring you
some breakfast.

132
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:10,453
Some strong coffee.

133
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,016
We'll talk afterwards.

134
00:06:12,358 --> 00:06:14,710
Why can't you tell me
what's happening to me?

135
00:06:14,793 --> 00:06:15,949
Do this for me.

136
00:06:16,014 --> 00:06:18,280
Have some breakfast and
some faith that i have

137
00:06:18,363 --> 00:06:20,299
the best
interest at heart.

138
00:06:21,002 --> 00:06:24,167
I promise, all your
questions will be answered.

139
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,793
I'll be back soon.

140
00:06:55,945 --> 00:06:57,517
How's our patient vasco?

141
00:06:57,961 --> 00:06:59,802
Pretty much what
we expected.

142
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,337
Disoriented.

143
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,095
Angry.

144
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:02,955
Confused.

145
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,419
You reassured her,
of course.

146
00:07:04,493 --> 00:07:06,198
Gained her trust.

147
00:07:06,305 --> 00:07:07,341
Yes.

148
00:07:07,406 --> 00:07:11,475
But as i told you from the outset,
vasco isn't a simple case.

149
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:58,634
Dr. Baumgartner.

150
00:07:59,207 --> 00:08:01,991
I was wondering about your
orders for patient vasco.

151
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,702
No more restraints?

152
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:05,676
No, not at present.

153
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:08,735
Any special orders
for staff, then?

154
00:08:08,799 --> 00:08:11,121
Do we need to be
on suicide watch?

155
00:08:11,195 --> 00:08:13,828
No, i don't expect that
to be a problem.

156
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:14,906
Thank you.

157
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:15,849
Okay.

158
00:08:22,864 --> 00:08:24,633
No sudden movements,

159
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,500
that's how you pull
these things off.

160
00:08:27,537 --> 00:08:28,397
Sorry.

161
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:34,066
The doctor said he'd be
back to speak with me.

162
00:08:34,108 --> 00:08:35,957
That was over
an hour ago.

163
00:08:36,004 --> 00:08:36,780
I'll let him know.

164
00:08:37,298 --> 00:08:38,436
Soon, please.

165
00:10:38,377 --> 00:10:39,173
Seth?

166
00:10:40,384 --> 00:10:41,337
Dr. Carpenter.

167
00:10:41,411 --> 00:10:42,798
Were we expecting you?

168
00:10:42,844 --> 00:10:44,222
I'm concerned
about jane vasco.

169
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:44,851
Of course you are.

170
00:10:44,902 --> 00:10:45,818
That's to be expected.

171
00:10:45,864 --> 00:10:46,789
How is she doing?

172
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,038
She hasn't recovered from
her coma yet,

173
00:10:48,075 --> 00:10:49,621
Dr. Baumgartner is
encouraged though.

174
00:10:49,677 --> 00:10:51,157
Her vitals are strong.

175
00:10:51,194 --> 00:10:52,054
If i could just
look in on her.

176
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,829
There's really no
point right now.

177
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:55,207
I'm sorry you
wasted a trip.

178
00:10:55,272 --> 00:10:58,383
If there's any change, I assure you,
we'll let you know.

179
00:11:02,737 --> 00:11:03,468
Seth!

180
00:11:04,429 --> 00:11:05,198
Seth!

181
00:11:11,626 --> 00:11:12,294
Seth!

182
00:11:12,358 --> 00:11:13,135
Seth!

183
00:11:13,219 --> 00:11:13,746
Jane!

184
00:11:13,811 --> 00:11:15,096
I don't know why they're
lying to you

185
00:11:15,152 --> 00:11:17,630
or what's going on but we've got
to get out of here.

186
00:11:17,713 --> 00:11:19,119
Seth, we've
got to go, now!

187
00:11:19,156 --> 00:11:20,627
Security! Guards!

188
00:11:21,117 --> 00:11:22,578
What are you doing?

189
00:11:22,698 --> 00:11:24,002
This is no way
to behave, jane.

190
00:11:24,049 --> 00:11:25,639
What are you
talking about?

191
00:11:25,723 --> 00:11:27,433
Why are you
doing this to me?

192
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,002
What did you expect,
jane?

193
00:11:28,008 --> 00:11:30,783
How should we treat you
after you killed riley?

194
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:32,522
What?!!!!!!!

195
00:11:36,261 --> 00:11:37,685
Get off of me!!!!!!

196
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:41,135
It is impossible !

197
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,773
I don't believe it.

198
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:45,058
That's not going
to bring jensen back.

199
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:47,120
It doesn't make any sense?

200
00:11:47,758 --> 00:11:49,710
Why would i do that?

201
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,761
When was this supposed
to have happened?

202
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,859
Is this another thing you
claim not to remember?

203
00:11:57,932 --> 00:11:58,927
Andre...

204
00:11:59,358 --> 00:12:00,523
I honestly don't rember.

205
00:12:00,616 --> 00:12:02,142
You want to play this game,

206
00:12:02,216 --> 00:12:03,446
jensen had too
much to drink.

207
00:12:03,483 --> 00:12:04,593
You walked to his place.

208
00:12:04,676 --> 00:12:06,399
He was found dead
the next morning.

209
00:12:06,464 --> 00:12:08,536
Why don't you tell
me what happened!

210
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:10,284
What set you off?!

211
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,374
How am I supposed to tell
you what happened,

212
00:12:12,448 --> 00:12:14,519
when i don't even
believe this!!

213
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,186
You don't believe it?

214
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:19,794
Really?

215
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:26,785
You believe that?

216
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,024
Is that yours?

217
00:12:28,089 --> 00:12:28,986
Looks like it is.

218
00:12:29,042 --> 00:12:30,812
Does that jog your memory?

219
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:36,409
Riley, you're really
going to feel terrible.

220
00:12:37,065 --> 00:12:38,878
It doesn't make any sense.

221
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,863
I made a bad call
with you, vasco.

222
00:12:41,955 --> 00:12:43,726
I should've
turned you in.

223
00:12:46,385 --> 00:12:47,541
What are you
talking about?

224
00:12:47,597 --> 00:12:49,826
Your healing powers,
jane.

225
00:12:52,065 --> 00:12:54,331
What did you think
that was all about?

226
00:12:55,321 --> 00:12:57,661
Your dna has tested
neuro positive.

227
00:12:58,923 --> 00:13:00,622
Why didn't you tell me?

228
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:03,615
Would it have
changed anything?

229
00:13:03,955 --> 00:13:05,407
The question is,

230
00:13:05,592 --> 00:13:07,485
why didn't i report it
to my superiors,

231
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:09,469
if i had jensen
might be alive today.

232
00:13:09,524 --> 00:13:10,200
In that sense,

233
00:13:10,274 --> 00:13:12,160
i own this
as much as you do.

234
00:13:12,771 --> 00:13:14,188
And this place?

235
00:13:15,575 --> 00:13:16,747
What is it?

236
00:13:18,183 --> 00:13:20,716
If I am what you say I am,

237
00:13:20,969 --> 00:13:22,448
why not just chip me

238
00:13:22,504 --> 00:13:24,354
and take me to the lab at
the internment center?

239
00:13:24,409 --> 00:13:26,129
Where the others go.

240
00:13:26,249 --> 00:13:27,285
Chip you?

241
00:13:28,154 --> 00:13:29,838
With your abilities?

242
00:13:31,021 --> 00:13:32,224
As for
the internment centre,

243
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,041
we'd get no
answers there.

244
00:13:34,092 --> 00:13:36,132
Nico has been
a complete failure.

245
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,702
And this place?

246
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,394
Baumgartner?

247
00:13:43,069 --> 00:13:45,212
Baumgartner was head
of research at nico.

248
00:13:45,295 --> 00:13:48,425
Fought an uphill battle for two years
to change procedures.

249
00:13:51,112 --> 00:13:52,974
But we still sent
neuros there.

250
00:13:53,048 --> 00:13:54,426
No alternative.

251
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:56,396
Not until
baumgartner quit.

252
00:13:57,727 --> 00:13:59,105
Nico's no more
than a warehouse.

253
00:13:59,152 --> 00:14:00,215
They've cut funding
to almost nothing.

254
00:14:00,326 --> 00:14:01,290
The place is a toilet.

255
00:14:01,345 --> 00:14:03,685
The only one who seemed
to care was baumgartner

256
00:14:03,787 --> 00:14:05,452
about research
about finding answers.

257
00:14:05,489 --> 00:14:07,126
And maybe a cure.

258
00:14:07,588 --> 00:14:09,231
that's beautiful.

259
00:14:12,908 --> 00:14:14,573
You think he can help me?

260
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,637
Help you.

261
00:14:17,904 --> 00:14:20,671
Do you think i give a damn
if he could help you.

262
00:14:20,808 --> 00:14:25,107
As far as i'm concerned,
you're here to help him.

263
00:14:29,842 --> 00:14:31,303
An intact neuro.

264
00:14:32,052 --> 00:14:35,265
Unchipped, powers
fully functioning.

265
00:14:36,671 --> 00:14:38,946
There's a lot
he can learn from you.

266
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:42,517
Things i should have
but didn't.

267
00:15:07,387 --> 00:15:09,912
I'll be taking marrow
samples along each leg.

268
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:14,150
I'll need ten intraosseus
1.27 mm needles.

269
00:15:14,853 --> 00:15:16,258
Did you say ten?

270
00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:18,563
In a single session?

271
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:22,293
I should up
the dosage of tetracaine
or else she'll feel pain?

272
00:15:22,771 --> 00:15:23,807
You won't need
an anesthetic.

273
00:15:23,853 --> 00:15:25,725
For bone marrow extrusion?

274
00:15:26,002 --> 00:15:28,444
Protocol calls for
a 5 mig minimum, doctor.

275
00:15:28,499 --> 00:15:31,015
Anything less and she'll
be screaming in agony.

276
00:15:31,727 --> 00:15:34,201
We're setting new
standards, nurse wells.

277
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,313
I don't understand.

278
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:37,845
I don't need you
to understand.

279
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,408
I need you to assist.

280
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:41,433
First needle please.

281
00:15:50,442 --> 00:15:53,577
- If you need something you should tell me now.
- I don't need anything...

282
00:15:53,642 --> 00:15:57,249
That's all, nurse,
you can wait outside please.

283
00:16:06,862 --> 00:16:10,850
Okay, jane, just relax.

284
00:16:28,061 --> 00:16:30,548
I don't give a damn
about what happens.

285
00:16:31,409 --> 00:16:34,423
As far as i'm concerned
you are here to help him.

286
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,803
Hey, how are you doing?

287
00:16:48,681 --> 00:16:50,819
I'm still alive.

288
00:16:52,086 --> 00:16:53,829
So not doing so good.

289
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,175
Well...

290
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:57,998
Dr. Baumgartner seems
quite sure of his methods.

291
00:16:58,054 --> 00:17:00,507
Even if they seem
a little unconventional.

292
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:07,950
I'm &just going to sterilize the entry sites,
it'll only sting a little.

293
00:17:17,361 --> 00:17:19,294
I must've misunderstood.

294
00:17:20,336 --> 00:17:22,583
There're no points
of entry.

295
00:17:23,332 --> 00:17:23,896
Didn't they...?

296
00:17:23,924 --> 00:17:25,673
Didn't they tell you?

297
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:27,853
I'm different.

298
00:17:30,804 --> 00:17:32,690
Is there anything
i can get for you?

299
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,142
Are you in pain?

300
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,574
What's it going to be for you, lady,
maye a puma...

301
00:17:38,075 --> 00:17:42,431
What i need,
you can't get for me.

302
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:46,893
We have a visitor.

303
00:17:50,573 --> 00:17:52,120
I'll send her in.

304
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:00,623
Hey, kiddo.

305
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,080
How you doing?

306
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:05,097
Mo,

307
00:18:06,993 --> 00:18:08,894
did i really
do those things?

308
00:18:09,699 --> 00:18:11,549
Did i really kill riley?

309
00:18:12,954 --> 00:18:14,332
I loved riley.

310
00:18:16,636 --> 00:18:18,828
I don't know
what's happening to me.

311
00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:21,649
You'll be okay.

312
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,804
I don't even know
who i am anymore.

313
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:30,057
What did andre say to you?

314
00:18:33,883 --> 00:18:36,565
He told me what happened

315
00:18:39,957 --> 00:18:41,631
and what i have to do.

316
00:18:43,906 --> 00:18:45,635
Follow doctor's orders.

317
00:18:48,395 --> 00:18:49,634
Baumgartner.

318
00:18:51,983 --> 00:18:53,730
Let me ask you something.

319
00:18:54,018 --> 00:18:55,829
What's your take
on that guy?

320
00:18:56,145 --> 00:18:57,628
What do you mean?

321
00:18:58,479 --> 00:18:59,117
I don't know.

322
00:18:59,154 --> 00:19:00,906
It's just
this whole thing.

323
00:19:06,305 --> 00:19:07,045
Why?

324
00:19:08,284 --> 00:19:10,596
Before you, before
any of this happen,

325
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:13,715
did you ever hear any discussion
that nico was failing?

326
00:19:15,658 --> 00:19:18,322
Andre probably thought it
was none of our business.

327
00:19:18,386 --> 00:19:19,154
Maybe.

328
00:19:19,376 --> 00:19:21,502
Or maybe he has
something to hide.

329
00:19:21,836 --> 00:19:24,520
It's a chameleon, always blends in.

330
00:19:25,741 --> 00:19:26,490
You?

331
00:19:26,795 --> 00:19:29,699
The fact that he has someone
like you on our team.

332
00:19:30,438 --> 00:19:31,872
You mean a neuro.

333
00:19:31,955 --> 00:19:33,742
That's not
been confirmed.

334
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,193
Apparently you missed
the morning edition.

335
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,836
Mo, what're
you getting at?

336
00:19:40,993 --> 00:19:41,483
I don't know.

337
00:19:41,539 --> 00:19:43,980
It's more questions than answers.
It's just...

338
00:19:44,831 --> 00:19:46,263
I don't know, baumgartner.

339
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:48,670
Keeping you away from
the internment center

340
00:19:48,725 --> 00:19:51,250
could be andre's way
of covering his ass.

341
00:19:51,796 --> 00:19:53,997
That doesn't
sound like andre.

342
00:19:54,062 --> 00:19:54,681
No,

343
00:19:54,765 --> 00:19:57,277
but killing riley
doesn't sound like you.

344
00:19:58,744 --> 00:20:01,639
I want to look
into this,
if i find any answers...

345
00:20:02,138 --> 00:20:02,732
Trust me.

346
00:20:02,778 --> 00:20:04,276
I want to be the
first to know.

347
00:20:05,627 --> 00:20:06,897
So hang in there, okay.

348
00:20:07,356 --> 00:20:08,623
I'll be back.

349
00:20:24,215 --> 00:20:24,807
Nurse wells,

350
00:20:24,872 --> 00:20:27,586
bring me the bone marrow
results for patient vasco.

351
00:21:27,385 --> 00:21:29,447
Perhaps i left it
in my office.

352
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:31,195
I found them,
dr. Baumgartner.

353
00:21:31,241 --> 00:21:31,991
Good.

354
00:21:32,934 --> 00:21:35,496
I'll be in room c examining
the results.

355
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:49,581
Seth...

356
00:21:50,494 --> 00:21:52,833
You shouldn't be out of your
room without permission.

357
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,637
I just needed
to take a walk.

358
00:21:54,766 --> 00:21:55,673
To think.

359
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,125
I understand.

360
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:00,260
Next time, though,
ask for permission.

361
00:22:00,389 --> 00:22:02,279
This is a hospital,
not a prison.

362
00:22:02,492 --> 00:22:03,999
It's for your
own safety, jane.

363
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,969
What happened, seth?

364
00:22:06,219 --> 00:22:08,106
What would make
me hurt riley?

365
00:22:09,188 --> 00:22:10,907
I don't know.

366
00:22:11,002 --> 00:22:12,380
There's still a lot we
don't know about...

367
00:22:12,436 --> 00:22:13,111
Neuros?

368
00:22:15,164 --> 00:22:15,959
Your condition.

369
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:19,795
And you think this is
the best place for me?

370
00:22:20,692 --> 00:22:22,470
Maybe the only place.

371
00:22:22,514 --> 00:22:23,938
But why not nico?

372
00:22:24,327 --> 00:22:26,398
I thought all the research
was centered there?

373
00:22:26,472 --> 00:22:28,177
I thought andre told you.

374
00:22:30,091 --> 00:22:32,514
Nico's become an
embarrassment.

375
00:22:32,607 --> 00:22:34,077
They've given up trying to
do anything

376
00:22:34,114 --> 00:22:35,992
but store the people
we send them.

377
00:22:36,109 --> 00:22:37,966
That's why baumgartner left.

378
00:22:38,311 --> 00:22:39,282
Exactly.

379
00:22:39,726 --> 00:22:42,608
Jakob baumgartner is the
foremost expert in this field.

380
00:22:42,787 --> 00:22:45,494
He authored the first
paper describing
the neuro aberration.

381
00:22:45,609 --> 00:22:48,309
He's done nothing since
but study the phenomenon.

382
00:22:48,448 --> 00:22:51,581
He resigned from nico when he
saw their changed priorities.

383
00:22:51,824 --> 00:22:53,596
Do you trust him?

384
00:22:55,396 --> 00:22:56,155
I do.

385
00:22:58,245 --> 00:22:59,438
Sorry, jane.

386
00:23:03,207 --> 00:23:05,214
I'll look back
on you tomorrow.

387
00:23:23,953 --> 00:23:25,867
Connor, am i glad
to see you!!

388
00:23:25,923 --> 00:23:28,105
You got to know what's
going on here.

389
00:23:28,344 --> 00:23:29,870
Shhh, it's okay.

390
00:23:29,907 --> 00:23:30,684
Don't do this.

391
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,637
Listen to me!!!

392
00:23:37,037 --> 00:23:40,301
Why would i listen to anything
a damn neuro has to say?

393
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:44,593
Are you part of this, too?

394
00:23:44,676 --> 00:23:47,539
Face it, lady, you had us
all fooled for a while,

395
00:23:48,158 --> 00:23:50,526
but you're just another
chip candidate.

396
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,714
And what're you, connor?

397
00:23:55,528 --> 00:23:56,508
You and seth?

398
00:23:56,555 --> 00:23:57,738
All of you.

399
00:23:58,229 --> 00:24:01,125
You just march step to whatever
Andre tells you to do ?

400
00:24:02,289 --> 00:24:03,944
Mcbride didn't kill riley.

401
00:24:05,793 --> 00:24:06,765
You did.

402
00:24:07,948 --> 00:24:10,593
So yeah. right now, i'd
follow him into hell.

403
00:24:11,013 --> 00:24:12,877
And being here with you...

404
00:24:14,731 --> 00:24:16,808
It looks like
i'm already there.

405
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:22,845
How is she?

406
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,584
She feels cut off
and abandoned.

407
00:24:24,639 --> 00:24:26,468
Alone and isolated.

408
00:24:26,812 --> 00:24:29,382
She found the nico report
as we expected she would.

409
00:24:29,502 --> 00:24:31,217
Then we're almost there.

410
00:24:31,398 --> 00:24:32,130
Yes.

411
00:24:33,971 --> 00:24:37,106
I prefer speaking with
you face to face.

412
00:24:45,455 --> 00:24:47,055
Any word on vasco?

413
00:24:47,489 --> 00:24:49,231
Is that concern i hear?

414
00:24:49,857 --> 00:24:51,013
So i like the broad.

415
00:24:51,087 --> 00:24:53,464
I just want to find her so
I can bust her chops.

416
00:24:53,858 --> 00:24:56,106
I'm sure she'll
be flattered.

417
00:24:56,189 --> 00:24:56,864
Riley?

418
00:24:56,938 --> 00:24:58,646
Tell me you got something!

419
00:24:59,787 --> 00:25:03,023
Look, I got feelers running into every
system in the known universe.

420
00:25:03,098 --> 00:25:06,095
Airports, hospitals,
everything's running a blank.

421
00:25:06,465 --> 00:25:09,101
No credit card
use, no atm hits.

422
00:25:09,702 --> 00:25:10,728
Nothing.

423
00:25:10,823 --> 00:25:11,481
You two,

424
00:25:11,544 --> 00:25:14,272
i need a complete timeline of
everything you did that night.

425
00:25:14,356 --> 00:25:15,493
Every bar you stopped at,

426
00:25:15,567 --> 00:25:16,816
every joker
who offered you a drink.

427
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,509
Boss...

428
00:25:17,657 --> 00:25:18,425
What?

429
00:25:19,377 --> 00:25:20,274
We've been over
this ten times.

430
00:25:20,348 --> 00:25:21,662
We'll go through
it 10,000 times

431
00:25:21,736 --> 00:25:23,308
until we find her,
is that clear?!

432
00:25:23,382 --> 00:25:24,862
I want security footage

433
00:25:24,991 --> 00:25:27,137
from every red light camera,
bank lobby, every wired

434
00:25:27,183 --> 00:25:28,904
parking ramp you might
have passed on thursday night.

435
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:29,959
You think we
had a stalker?

436
00:25:30,051 --> 00:25:31,161
It happens.

437
00:25:31,235 --> 00:25:33,455
Wrong kind of guy sees a
couple of chicks out drinking,

438
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:35,216
faculties impaired maybe...

439
00:25:35,286 --> 00:25:37,939
Follows his favourite
one home, for
the snatch and grab.

440
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:39,763
How "impaired" was jane?

441
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,407
A few beers.

442
00:25:41,463 --> 00:25:42,323
Tequila.

443
00:25:43,516 --> 00:25:44,718
A few tequilas.

444
00:25:45,072 --> 00:25:47,755
Connor, emergency
rooms in person.

445
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:50,631
Every jane doe, every female admitted
in the last two days.

446
00:25:50,686 --> 00:25:51,139
Done.

447
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:51,805
Wait a minute!!

448
00:25:51,879 --> 00:25:52,869
If she'd been hurt,

449
00:25:52,906 --> 00:25:53,953
she would have
healed out by now.

450
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:54,767
Theoretically, yes.

451
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:56,247
But we have to check
all possibilities.

452
00:25:56,293 --> 00:25:58,568
If she's hurt and not healing,
we can figure out why later.

453
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:00,233
After we find her.

454
00:26:00,287 --> 00:26:01,166
Connor..

455
00:26:04,144 --> 00:26:06,249
You should check
the morgues, too.

456
00:26:14,129 --> 00:26:17,792
I think we're ready to
move to the final phase.

457
00:26:18,366 --> 00:26:21,399
She's convinced that i'm a fraud
and that her only hope

458
00:26:21,464 --> 00:26:23,120
lies in getting
to nico.

459
00:26:23,471 --> 00:26:26,523
Jakob, you understand
failure is not an option.

460
00:26:28,328 --> 00:26:30,381
You were quite
clear about that.

461
00:26:30,982 --> 00:26:33,932
It's crucial that i find
the location of that center.

462
00:26:33,997 --> 00:26:35,629
And she's the only one
who can take me to it.

463
00:26:35,703 --> 00:26:39,107
All that's left is to throw her a lifeline,
which is?

464
00:26:39,245 --> 00:26:41,844
The one person she
really trusts.

465
00:26:47,767 --> 00:26:48,951
This is good.

466
00:26:53,722 --> 00:26:54,767
Good evening.

467
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:56,578
Good evening, doctor.

468
00:27:06,393 --> 00:27:08,428
I'm afraid i was
right about andre.

469
00:27:08,511 --> 00:27:10,158
I found out some things.

470
00:27:10,223 --> 00:27:11,648
That makes two of us.

471
00:27:11,712 --> 00:27:12,933
I found a report.

472
00:27:13,016 --> 00:27:14,468
The nico report.

473
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,225
I managed to tap
into riley's database.

474
00:27:17,262 --> 00:27:18,464
I found the same thing.

475
00:27:18,521 --> 00:27:20,482
Then you know that
baumgartner's full of crap.

476
00:27:20,583 --> 00:27:22,174
I should be at nico.

477
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:23,848
The doctors there are
onto something.

478
00:27:23,904 --> 00:27:25,143
That's why i'm here.

479
00:27:25,198 --> 00:27:26,160
If andre finds out...

480
00:27:26,216 --> 00:27:27,843
The hell with Andre.

481
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:31,155
We've got to get
you out of here, jane.

482
00:27:31,804 --> 00:27:33,025
Thanks, mo.

483
00:27:34,366 --> 00:27:35,448
I owe you.

484
00:27:36,353 --> 00:27:37,296
You do.

485
00:27:37,638 --> 00:27:38,961
And you'll pay.

486
00:27:39,442 --> 00:27:41,486
Just lay low,
i got to figure things out.

487
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:42,623
I'll be back in
the morning.

488
00:27:42,688 --> 00:27:44,408
And we'll get you
to nico.

489
00:27:50,894 --> 00:27:55,696
I'd like to check on the state
credentials of a dr. Jakob baumgartner?

490
00:27:58,305 --> 00:28:00,099
Yeah ok, I'll hold..

491
00:28:05,875 --> 00:28:08,298
Hi, tomorrow...

492
00:28:08,742 --> 00:28:11,246
Can i call back in
the morning then?

493
00:28:11,748 --> 00:28:12,589
Perfect.

494
00:28:12,645 --> 00:28:14,365
Thank you very much.

495
00:28:28,656 --> 00:28:29,405
Jane.

496
00:28:30,452 --> 00:28:33,014
- Here you are !
- What are you doing here?

497
00:28:36,778 --> 00:28:38,991
They told me they moved
you tonight...

498
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:40,923
I have to talk to you.

499
00:28:41,525 --> 00:28:42,644
What is it?

500
00:28:44,142 --> 00:28:46,093
Whatever's going on here...

501
00:28:46,343 --> 00:28:47,087
Baumgartner...

502
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:49,066
He's not a... He's a..

503
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,081
He's a...

504
00:28:52,211 --> 00:28:53,700
- What ?
- He's a...

505
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,515
I don't know what he is.

506
00:28:55,542 --> 00:28:57,762
I'm not even know
if he's human.

507
00:28:57,836 --> 00:29:00,028
But this hospital,
this whole place...

508
00:29:00,083 --> 00:29:01,035
What they're
doing to you...

509
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:02,515
It's all a lie!

510
00:29:02,589 --> 00:29:04,328
Okay, jane,
it's a lie.

511
00:29:05,364 --> 00:29:06,436
What do you mean?

512
00:29:06,483 --> 00:29:09,461
There are no patients
here, none.

513
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,208
And no other doctors.

514
00:29:11,263 --> 00:29:12,429
Whatever's going on...

515
00:29:12,503 --> 00:29:14,140
It's all about you.

516
00:29:15,481 --> 00:29:16,285
I know.

517
00:29:17,211 --> 00:29:18,830
I don't understand.

518
00:29:21,207 --> 00:29:22,585
I saw something earlier.

519
00:29:24,579 --> 00:29:25,920
I don't know how
to explain it.

520
00:29:25,966 --> 00:29:28,759
But the doctor...

521
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:30,710
Somehow he changed...

522
00:29:30,988 --> 00:29:32,440
I know it sounds insane

523
00:29:32,492 --> 00:29:34,850
but he's some kind of monster who
can change his appearance.

524
00:29:34,897 --> 00:29:36,709
I don't know what he is.

525
00:29:41,831 --> 00:29:42,719
That's okay..

526
00:29:43,685 --> 00:29:44,758
That's okay

527
00:29:56,268 --> 00:29:58,071
We're called
neuros, shelly.

528
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:35,509
How are you feeling?

529
00:30:35,564 --> 00:30:38,213
Little bit woozy,
must have given me something.

530
00:30:39,088 --> 00:30:41,206
If we're going to do this,
we're doing it now.

531
00:30:41,261 --> 00:30:42,200
Let's go.

532
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,389
What are you doing
out of your room?

533
00:31:36,601 --> 00:31:37,655
Get down!!!

534
00:31:37,711 --> 00:31:39,357
Everybody stay down!!!

535
00:31:39,422 --> 00:31:41,279
Everybody stay down!!!

536
00:31:41,907 --> 00:31:43,526
No one will get hurt!!!

537
00:31:50,455 --> 00:31:51,621
Stay down!!!

538
00:31:54,959 --> 00:31:56,180
Put it down!!

539
00:31:57,762 --> 00:31:59,019
Put it down!

540
00:32:00,012 --> 00:32:02,297
Damn it jane,
my gun's jammed!

541
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,214
No!!

542
00:32:11,546 --> 00:32:12,341
Mo!!!!

543
00:32:26,882 --> 00:32:27,585
My ankle!

544
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,074
Where's the car?

545
00:32:32,496 --> 00:32:33,746
Go! Go!! Go!!! Hurry!!!

546
00:32:33,811 --> 00:32:34,662
I am!!

547
00:32:50,704 --> 00:32:51,611
Are you okay, mo?!

548
00:32:51,657 --> 00:32:52,868
Yeah, i'm okay.

549
00:32:52,915 --> 00:32:55,486
Brought your clothes
to change into.

550
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,066
Aren't you relieved
you'll be at nico soon?!

551
00:33:01,732 --> 00:33:04,164
You always had my best mo,
i appreciate it.

552
00:33:08,795 --> 00:33:11,088
Hey Mo, you know what ?
I heu...

553
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:14,205
I officially
forgive you

554
00:33:14,251 --> 00:33:17,908
for stealing todd engels
right out from under me

555
00:33:18,017 --> 00:33:19,928
the first year
at the academy.

556
00:33:20,662 --> 00:33:22,410
Hey, what did you expect.

557
00:33:22,817 --> 00:33:23,973
He was there.

558
00:33:24,584 --> 00:33:26,572
I wasn't really
into him anyway.

559
00:33:29,735 --> 00:33:32,410
Thanks for driving,
my ankle still killing me.

560
00:33:32,465 --> 00:33:34,324
Don't talk to me
about your ankle,

561
00:33:34,398 --> 00:33:36,590
i'm the one who got
shot in the back.

562
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:01,911
let's get out of here.

563
00:34:01,966 --> 00:34:03,924
Fill it up, we don't
want to stop again.

564
00:34:03,984 --> 00:34:05,612
We're attracting
too much attention.

565
00:34:05,658 --> 00:34:09,866
Hand me my wallet out of my purse
and i'll pay you when we get going.

566
00:34:12,375 --> 00:34:13,892
Have you got cash?

567
00:34:14,197 --> 00:34:16,232
I don't want anybody
tracking us by my cards.

568
00:34:16,417 --> 00:34:17,813
Good thinking.

569
00:34:18,017 --> 00:34:18,964
Thanks.

570
00:34:52,895 --> 00:34:54,589
Jane's credit card!

571
00:35:04,531 --> 00:35:06,741
$23.47 for gas.

572
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,424
How soon before
we get to nico, jane?

573
00:35:10,461 --> 00:35:12,570
We won't get there
until tomorrow.

574
00:35:12,644 --> 00:35:14,678
You planning
to drive all night?

575
00:35:14,937 --> 00:35:16,708
I could use a break.

576
00:35:17,297 --> 00:35:18,814
How's the ankle?

577
00:35:20,617 --> 00:35:22,272
Not good, actually.

578
00:35:22,856 --> 00:35:24,869
Want to stop
and take a rest?

579
00:35:25,321 --> 00:35:27,208
I just want to get there.

580
00:35:37,858 --> 00:35:39,763
How'd you girls
like your food?

581
00:35:40,133 --> 00:35:41,012
It was fine.

582
00:35:41,095 --> 00:35:43,037
Best hash browns
in the state.

583
00:35:43,919 --> 00:35:44,760
Great.

584
00:35:44,862 --> 00:35:46,767
I get you anything else?

585
00:35:46,823 --> 00:35:48,969
No, i think
we're gonna head out.

586
00:35:49,607 --> 00:35:51,338
Just the check.

587
00:35:51,514 --> 00:35:52,707
Do you have enough cash?

588
00:35:53,743 --> 00:35:55,324
Meet you in the car.

589
00:36:19,589 --> 00:36:20,625
Your foot better?

590
00:36:20,662 --> 00:36:21,374
You want to drive?

591
00:36:21,411 --> 00:36:24,166
It's a little sore but if you're
sick of it, I can try.

592
00:36:24,546 --> 00:36:26,216
It's fine,
i'll do it.

593
00:36:26,257 --> 00:36:27,080
Thanks

594
00:36:32,731 --> 00:36:33,794
Thank you!!

595
00:36:33,951 --> 00:36:35,413
Bless your hearts!

596
00:36:37,105 --> 00:36:38,178
No problem.

597
00:36:38,206 --> 00:36:40,388
What can i say,
i'm a good tipper.

598
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:55,032
Another hit.

599
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,478
$23.47 again.

600
00:37:07,373 --> 00:37:08,510
$23.47...

601
00:37:08,908 --> 00:37:10,323
$23.47...

602
00:37:13,534 --> 00:37:15,005
How's the ankle?

603
00:37:15,106 --> 00:37:16,854
Still a little swollen.

604
00:37:17,631 --> 00:37:20,343
Hope you don't mind driving
the rest of the way to nico.

605
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,239
No, we're almost there.

606
00:37:22,285 --> 00:37:23,367
Excellent.

607
00:37:39,271 --> 00:37:40,417
This is it.

608
00:37:48,176 --> 00:37:49,332
This is it?

609
00:37:49,396 --> 00:37:50,673
This is nico?

610
00:37:51,872 --> 00:37:52,612
Why?

611
00:37:53,379 --> 00:37:54,989
I just expected...

612
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:01,745
Don't you recognize it?

613
00:38:02,287 --> 00:38:03,998
This is where you live.

614
00:38:04,091 --> 00:38:05,907
No, that's not
exactly right.

615
00:38:06,403 --> 00:38:08,122
This is where i live.

616
00:38:13,848 --> 00:38:16,188
You forgot one
small detail, doc.

617
00:38:16,805 --> 00:38:18,886
Maureen just
got a new tattoo.

618
00:38:21,707 --> 00:38:25,057
And you didn't realize i saw
you walking without a limp.

619
00:38:29,128 --> 00:38:31,137
As my father
always says...

620
00:38:31,625 --> 00:38:34,178
What you don't
know can hurt you.

621
00:38:38,238 --> 00:38:39,052
Are you okay?

622
00:38:39,107 --> 00:38:40,180
I will be.

623
00:38:42,335 --> 00:38:43,102
What?

624
00:38:44,212 --> 00:38:47,214
I never thought i'd be so
happy to see the real you.

625
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:50,997
Where's riley?

626
00:38:51,515 --> 00:38:53,633
He's back
at the command centre.

627
00:38:54,363 --> 00:38:55,343
Connor...

628
00:38:55,584 --> 00:38:58,130
Want to get this garbage
in the car, please.

629
00:39:00,948 --> 00:39:02,372
You got my messages.

630
00:39:02,483 --> 00:39:03,729
Guess i did.

631
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:19,562
I don't think we ever had
a shape-shifter before.

632
00:39:19,611 --> 00:39:21,630
The guy did a pretty
good "you."

633
00:39:21,896 --> 00:39:23,745
never as good as
the real thing.

634
00:39:23,847 --> 00:39:24,652
Really?

635
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,214
You took a hell
of a risk, vasco,

636
00:39:27,278 --> 00:39:28,908
even if you didn't
believe maureen.

637
00:39:28,935 --> 00:39:31,016
How did you know the rest
of us weren't real.

638
00:39:31,081 --> 00:39:33,589
To be honest, i had my
doubts about you, too.

639
00:39:34,161 --> 00:39:36,290
I mean baumgartner's
version of you.

640
00:39:36,872 --> 00:39:38,953
He kept referring
to riley as jensen.

641
00:39:39,138 --> 00:39:40,724
You never do that.

642
00:39:41,024 --> 00:39:41,810
Smart.

643
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:47,435
So once i figured out maureen wasn't
maureen, the rest fell into place,

644
00:39:47,509 --> 00:39:52,274
besides you would never had been caught
with someone like todd engels.

645
00:39:53,097 --> 00:39:53,495
Who?

646
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:54,225
Exactly.

647
00:39:54,318 --> 00:39:58,287
Mo, i officially forgive you
for stealing todd engels.

648
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,257
What do you expect,
he was there.

649
00:40:00,368 --> 00:40:03,521
Rember that little dude from
first year at the academy?

650
00:40:03,613 --> 00:40:06,233
Oh, the dorky guy who was
always quoting mark twain?

651
00:40:06,767 --> 00:40:07,424
No.

652
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:09,902
I figured wherever you guys were,
you'd be looking for me.

653
00:40:09,958 --> 00:40:11,837
And i knew that if
anyone could find me..

654
00:40:11,893 --> 00:40:15,296
It would have to be "the best."
I brought donuts.

655
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:16,582
Sweet!!!

656
00:40:16,906 --> 00:40:17,824
Riley!!!

657
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:26,351
They told me i killed you.

658
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,330
I could think of
worse ways to go.

659
00:40:30,569 --> 00:40:32,095
I got it right away.

660
00:40:32,169 --> 00:40:33,654
$23.47 for gas.

661
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:35,934
$23.47 for breakfast.

662
00:40:38,708 --> 00:40:40,114
I told him
i was using cash

663
00:40:40,169 --> 00:40:42,084
but i knew you'd pick up those
hits on my credit card.

664
00:40:42,121 --> 00:40:42,593
Of course.

665
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:44,227
Hey, it was big tip.

666
00:40:44,278 --> 00:40:46,784
Everyone knows you're
not that big a tipper.

667
00:40:46,988 --> 00:40:48,579
Good thing you
remembered my address.

668
00:40:48,643 --> 00:40:49,735
Good information.

669
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:51,257
Don't even think about it.

670
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,875
So what was it about?

671
00:40:52,949 --> 00:40:54,632
Did baumgartner
give anything up?

672
00:40:54,688 --> 00:40:55,298
Not a thing.

673
00:40:55,363 --> 00:40:57,793
Obviously he wanted
the location of nico.

674
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,553
He has it now.

675
00:40:59,951 --> 00:41:01,504
Hope you had a good
vacation, vasco.

676
00:41:01,551 --> 00:41:02,771
But we've got work to do.

677
00:41:02,855 --> 00:41:03,835
Vacation?

678
00:41:04,716 --> 00:41:06,669
Yep, I'm home !

679
00:41:13,961 --> 00:41:17,013
We often take our friends for granted
until something happens

680
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,670
and makes us appreciate
them more than ever.

681
00:41:19,776 --> 00:41:23,348
Like being there for us when
we break up with our boyfriends.

682
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:24,427
Or when we realize

683
00:41:24,497 --> 00:41:27,664
they don't want to be
dissected in medical experiments

684
00:41:27,722 --> 00:41:29,422
and locked up for killing
one of them.

685
00:41:29,526 --> 00:41:31,223
Absolutely nothing.

686
00:41:35,093 --> 00:41:36,912
Not a scrap of paper.

687
00:41:37,081 --> 00:41:38,700
It's like no one
was ever here.

688
00:41:38,827 --> 00:41:41,999
According to riley,
there's no record
of any recent tenants.

689
00:41:42,237 --> 00:41:44,121
I can try to track something down
through utilities

690
00:41:44,202 --> 00:41:46,091
or moving services, but

691
00:41:46,184 --> 00:41:47,178
I'm not holding
out much hope.

692
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:49,286
This was a pro job.

693
00:41:49,352 --> 00:41:51,352
Whoever did this
has skills and money

694
00:41:53,537 --> 00:41:55,286
Give me a minute.

695
00:42:03,333 --> 00:42:04,870
When i was in this room,

696
00:42:04,986 --> 00:42:07,595
i thought my friends
had turned on me.

697
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,092
I thought i deserved it.

698
00:42:10,704 --> 00:42:14,600
I was never happier to find
out it wasn't true.

699
00:42:17,357 --> 00:42:18,663
To be honest...

700
00:42:18,756 --> 00:42:22,363
There's a part of me stil
waiting for it to happen.

701
00:42:32,168 --> 00:42:32,943
Ready?

702
00:42:35,012 --> 00:42:35,844
Yeah.

703
00:42:36,908 --> 00:42:38,595
There's nothing here.

704
00:42:40,572 --> 00:42:44,479
They've accepted me as part of their
team, even with my gift.

705
00:42:44,618 --> 00:42:48,040
But i'm still not sure that
gift isn't really a curse,

706
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:51,447
and it's just a matter of time
before they realize it.

707
00:42:51,563 --> 00:42:55,332
Okay, i have trust issues,
sue me.

708
