1
00:00:00,748 --> 00:00:02,132
My name is Jane Vasco.

2
00:00:02,244 --> 00:00:03,577
I could use
you on my team.

3
00:00:03,648 --> 00:00:07,287
I work for a secret government
agency that hunts neuros.

4
00:00:07,358 --> 00:00:10,712
People who can do dangerous
things with their minds.

5
00:00:11,389 --> 00:00:12,342
On my first assignment...

6
00:00:12,936 --> 00:00:14,976
Something a little
weird happened,

7
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:17,870
okay, something
really weird.

8
00:00:18,454 --> 00:00:23,343
Until i get some answers I'm getting on
with my life, doing my job.

9
00:00:23,585 --> 00:00:25,184
Stocking up on aspirin,

10
00:00:25,348 --> 00:00:28,372
because I have to tell ya,

11
00:00:28,633 --> 00:00:30,054
pain's a bitch!

12
00:00:54,919 --> 00:00:55,854
hello?

13
00:01:10,647 --> 00:01:11,907
Anybody in here?

14
00:01:49,023 --> 00:01:50,318
oh, my god.

15
00:01:52,582 --> 00:01:54,596
Hey, man,
you all right?

16
00:02:07,282 --> 00:02:12,513
Trasncript : swsub.com
Presync : IceFre@k

17
00:02:17,784 --> 00:02:21,945
some people say physical pain is easier
to deal with than emotional pain,

18
00:02:22,038 --> 00:02:22,766
but then again,

19
00:02:22,807 --> 00:02:25,359
they've never fallen 40 stories
and lived to tell about it.

20
00:02:25,749 --> 00:02:29,858
Not to mention being shot,
stabbed, beaten and lasered.

21
00:02:30,145 --> 00:02:32,704
What a fun time it's been since
i left the d.e.a.

22
00:02:32,751 --> 00:02:35,222
And joined them up with
the neuro hunters.

23
00:02:35,314 --> 00:02:37,364
Still i understand
what they mean,

24
00:02:37,466 --> 00:02:40,785
for me physical pain is horrible
but at least it's temporary.

25
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:43,140
The other kind seems
to hang on forever.

26
00:02:43,888 --> 00:02:45,763
If i had to chose one
over the other

27
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:47,577
it would probably
be the physical.

28
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:50,672
But then again ask me next
time i get hit by a truck.

29
00:02:50,775 --> 00:02:52,230
Alright showtime!

30
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:55,591
This is a restaurant in
thermopolis, wyoming.

31
00:02:55,663 --> 00:02:58,522
A patron named alan sloane
stacks up the furniture

32
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,793
then climbed out
through the skylight.

33
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:03,251
Margot branton's
place three weeks later.

34
00:03:03,363 --> 00:03:04,675
By the way, when they
people were found,

35
00:03:04,747 --> 00:03:07,719
they were lying on the floor,
shivering and catatonic.

36
00:03:07,944 --> 00:03:10,568
James cho was working late
in his office this night.

37
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,907
That was two days ago.

38
00:03:12,876 --> 00:03:13,998
Is he crying?

39
00:03:14,562 --> 00:03:15,545
He looks freaked.

40
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:16,683
What's he hiding from?

41
00:03:16,816 --> 00:03:17,554
No idea.

42
00:03:17,616 --> 00:03:19,721
Security cameras don't
reveal any kind of threat.

43
00:03:19,834 --> 00:03:22,560
He stacked everything up beneath
a window, just like the other two.

44
00:03:22,622 --> 00:03:24,681
In mr. Cho's case,
the window was too small.

45
00:03:24,886 --> 00:03:26,373
He chokes himself
to death.

46
00:03:26,444 --> 00:03:27,173
What about the others?

47
00:03:27,223 --> 00:03:29,201
Have they received any
kind of treatment?

48
00:03:29,365 --> 00:03:31,397
Sloane and branton are
still under going treatment.

49
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,365
Sloane attempted suicide
and it's questionable

50
00:03:33,437 --> 00:03:34,779
whether either
will fully recover.

51
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,999
How do they explain
what happened?

52
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:36,921
They can't.

53
00:03:37,003 --> 00:03:38,499
They barely
remember doing it.

54
00:03:38,694 --> 00:03:39,642
Tox screens?

55
00:03:39,693 --> 00:03:40,287
Clear.

56
00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:42,101
And none of these
people had any history

57
00:03:42,173 --> 00:03:43,577
of mental instability
before the event.

58
00:03:43,679 --> 00:03:44,415
So whatta we have?

59
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:47,499
A neuro who gets their kicks
outta driving people crazy?

60
00:03:49,472 --> 00:03:50,784
Any connection
between the victims?

61
00:03:50,846 --> 00:03:52,075
None, that we can tell.

62
00:03:52,127 --> 00:03:55,355
Different backgrounds, different
professions, complete strangers.

63
00:03:55,427 --> 00:03:57,066
I'd like to know if there
have been any other cases.

64
00:03:57,118 --> 00:03:57,743
Can you get me into...?

65
00:03:57,774 --> 00:04:00,583
Every medical database
in the civilized world?

66
00:04:01,878 --> 00:04:03,032
Gimme a half hour.

67
00:04:03,913 --> 00:04:04,292
Yeah.

68
00:04:05,235 --> 00:04:07,470
Okay, 45 minutes.

69
00:04:08,728 --> 00:04:09,876
It would be useful
if we could trace back

70
00:04:09,937 --> 00:04:11,987
to the first victim,
patient zero.

71
00:04:12,233 --> 00:04:13,688
The first victim would,
most likely,

72
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:15,666
be the closest
to the source.

73
00:04:17,965 --> 00:04:18,631
Miss branton...

74
00:04:25,272 --> 00:04:25,723
Yes.

75
00:04:26,881 --> 00:04:28,705
I'm sorry,
what were you asking?

76
00:04:28,797 --> 00:04:32,220
If anything unusual
happened before your...

77
00:04:33,491 --> 00:04:34,188
Breakdown?

78
00:04:35,356 --> 00:04:36,340
Unusual?

79
00:04:37,498 --> 00:04:37,908
No.

80
00:04:38,738 --> 00:04:40,912
I went grocery
shopping that morning.

81
00:04:40,972 --> 00:04:43,135
I came home,
put things away.

82
00:04:43,688 --> 00:04:45,646
Then i heard this sound...

83
00:04:46,506 --> 00:04:47,828
A deep noise,

84
00:04:48,881 --> 00:04:51,180
thumping and creaking,
all around me.

85
00:04:51,262 --> 00:04:52,676
And i was so afraid.

86
00:04:53,865 --> 00:04:54,777
Of what?

87
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,414
I don't know.

88
00:05:01,016 --> 00:05:02,492
I had to stay quiet.

89
00:05:03,558 --> 00:05:05,351
What were you hiding from?

90
00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:08,255
I can't rember.

91
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:11,821
I don't want to...

92
00:05:12,477 --> 00:05:13,635
Please try.

93
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:18,283
Out.

94
00:05:19,318 --> 00:05:20,835
I just needed to get out.

95
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:22,792
Why?

96
00:05:22,857 --> 00:05:24,814
Don't you think they've
asked me that a hundred times?

97
00:05:24,886 --> 00:05:26,495
I don't know why.

98
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:31,640
I just knew if i couldn't
find a way out i would die.

99
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,169
You were in a restaurant
and the door...

100
00:05:35,273 --> 00:05:37,434
But i'm not in
a restaurant!!

101
00:05:39,247 --> 00:05:40,446
Where were you?

102
00:05:41,225 --> 00:05:42,717
Somewhere...

103
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:45,478
Cold.

104
00:05:45,994 --> 00:05:46,816
Small.

105
00:05:48,322 --> 00:05:49,814
Closing in all around me.

106
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,034
Collapsing?

107
00:05:51,075 --> 00:05:53,376
No...
I don't know.

108
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:55,063
Okay, okay, 

109
00:05:56,164 --> 00:05:58,228
You said there was
a creaking sound.

110
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,552
Anything else?

111
00:06:03,834 --> 00:06:04,718
Light.

112
00:06:06,898 --> 00:06:07,673
Above me.

113
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,795
I had to get there,
but i couldn't reach.

114
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:16,567
There was something
in front of me.

115
00:06:18,777 --> 00:06:20,296
Flowers.

116
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:24,200
Flowers.

117
00:06:24,563 --> 00:06:25,232
Good...

118
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,459
What else?

119
00:06:28,677 --> 00:06:30,197
I don't
want to do this...

120
00:06:30,267 --> 00:06:30,894
Please.

121
00:06:32,749 --> 00:06:34,227
Keep going.

122
00:06:34,631 --> 00:06:35,384
What else?

123
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,163
There was a hat.

124
00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:40,285
A hat, you saw a hat
while you were climbing?

125
00:06:40,812 --> 00:06:41,830
Yellow...

126
00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:43,879
A rain hat.

127
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,165
So cold...

128
00:06:51,332 --> 00:06:52,141
Okay, okay...

129
00:06:52,197 --> 00:06:53,521
You're doing fine.

130
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:55,442
Something else,

131
00:06:57,715 --> 00:06:59,374
brushing against me.

132
00:07:01,525 --> 00:07:03,656
I turned to look...

133
00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:06,292
I turned and...

134
00:07:11,149 --> 00:07:12,460
Mr. Sloane?

135
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:15,904
Mr. Sloane,
are you okay?

136
00:07:16,234 --> 00:07:17,976
Get that away from me!!!

137
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:22,480
Get it away!!!

138
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:25,212
It's okay.

139
00:07:25,773 --> 00:07:28,729
It's okay, it's okay.

140
00:07:32,814 --> 00:07:33,539
Oh, god.

141
00:07:33,605 --> 00:07:36,282
He had a very strong
reaction to my gun.

142
00:07:36,477 --> 00:07:39,210
Well, you're a women
carrying a piece.

143
00:07:39,336 --> 00:07:42,226
Maybe he's not as crazy as
everyone makes him out to be.

144
00:07:42,559 --> 00:07:44,989
Makes more sense than
being terrified of flowers.

145
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,693
Guns and flowers.

146
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,704
Maybe they're holding an
axle rose nightmare.

147
00:07:49,788 --> 00:07:52,235
Whatever sloane was trying
to get away from...

148
00:07:52,693 --> 00:07:55,286
Whatever he was seeing...
Clearly terrified him.

149
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,225
In a small,
enclosed space.

150
00:07:58,298 --> 00:07:59,889
It's all so damn vague.

151
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,618
What about mass
hallucination?

152
00:08:01,785 --> 00:08:02,803
It's not unheard of.

153
00:08:03,054 --> 00:08:04,762
But doesn't that usually
occur among people

154
00:08:04,866 --> 00:08:07,181
who are in the same place
at the same time?

155
00:08:13,586 --> 00:08:14,311
No!!

156
00:08:15,306 --> 00:08:16,039
No!!

157
00:08:17,373 --> 00:08:18,706
No!!!

158
00:08:28,126 --> 00:08:29,074
Grab her!!

159
00:08:30,287 --> 00:08:31,054
No!!

160
00:08:40,383 --> 00:08:42,209
Please, don't hurt mommy!

161
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:44,206
Help!!!

162
00:09:08,433 --> 00:09:09,075
What?

163
00:09:09,243 --> 00:09:13,111
I don't think our victims are suffering
from mass hallucination.

164
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:16,206
Okay, I'm listening.

165
00:09:16,304 --> 00:09:18,284
What if we have a neuro

166
00:09:18,368 --> 00:09:23,807
that can pass on one nightmare
at will, to anyone they chose.

167
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:30,989
A neuro who can infect
others with his nightmares.

168
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:31,593
Nightmare.

169
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:34,381
In this case, the same
one over and over.

170
00:09:34,451 --> 00:09:35,915
The question is why.

171
00:09:37,338 --> 00:09:39,443
If we only had more
details of the dream.

172
00:09:39,652 --> 00:09:40,907
We could piece the
facts together...

173
00:09:40,964 --> 00:09:41,897
Facts?

174
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:45,898
Recurring nightmares is often
associated with past experiences.

175
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:47,289
Especially
traumatic ones.

176
00:09:47,342 --> 00:09:48,848
I know that for a "fact."

177
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,246
does the little lady
have bad dreams?

178
00:09:51,301 --> 00:09:53,529
Tell me, sweetheart,
what's your nightmare?

179
00:09:53,653 --> 00:09:55,008
I'm looking at it.

180
00:09:56,611 --> 00:09:58,619
At least you're
dreaming about me.

181
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:01,045
Wait for it and... Boom!!

182
00:10:01,156 --> 00:10:01,588
Got it.

183
00:10:01,644 --> 00:10:02,955
Patient zero.

184
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:05,506
First reported case
of this type.

185
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,709
Twenty-eight minutes
for the record.

186
00:10:07,848 --> 00:10:09,772
Does that
include yesterday?

187
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,844
I just started today,
thanks for coming out.

188
00:10:14,154 --> 00:10:15,015
Alright...

189
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,260
This is the first case
i could find.

190
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,501
Went back ten years.

191
00:10:18,668 --> 00:10:19,575
Nothing.

192
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,536
This went down one month before
alan sloane popped his cork.

193
00:10:22,717 --> 00:10:24,279
Henry perkins.

194
00:10:24,903 --> 00:10:26,008
I know that name.

195
00:10:26,161 --> 00:10:28,113
It was all over the news
around ten years ago.

196
00:10:28,238 --> 00:10:30,067
Man had an argument
with his family.

197
00:10:30,351 --> 00:10:31,924
Settled it with
a butcher knife.

198
00:10:33,112 --> 00:10:36,988
The kid who cut his parents' throats
while they slept, burned down the house,

199
00:10:37,072 --> 00:10:38,689
went next door did the same
thing to the neighbors?

200
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:39,736
Exactly.

201
00:10:39,876 --> 00:10:41,953
He's been at graymore
psychiatric ever since.

202
00:10:42,106 --> 00:10:43,319
Was given cafeteria
privileges.

203
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:46,707
when he pulled the same stunt as
cho, sloane and branton.

204
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,506
Our three other victims.

205
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:51,862
If riley's right...

206
00:10:51,904 --> 00:10:52,601
If?

207
00:10:53,172 --> 00:10:57,397
If perkins is patient zero that could
place him close to the source.

208
00:10:59,196 --> 00:11:00,256
I know henry very well.

209
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,905
I've been in charge of his case since
he came to the institute.

210
00:11:02,975 --> 00:11:04,118
He was an unhappy kid.

211
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,205
Unhappy?

212
00:11:05,294 --> 00:11:06,697
He killed six people.

213
00:11:07,129 --> 00:11:09,577
The best we've been able
to do is keep him stable.

214
00:11:09,675 --> 00:11:12,393
Does "stable" include the
incident in the cafeteria

215
00:11:12,477 --> 00:11:14,666
where he piled up
all the furniture

216
00:11:14,736 --> 00:11:16,325
and tried to climb
to the top?

217
00:11:16,423 --> 00:11:17,986
I hear he caused
almost a riot.

218
00:11:18,048 --> 00:11:20,027
Henry's still reluctant
to discuss that.

219
00:11:20,111 --> 00:11:23,457
Is there a way we could find out who
he had contact with henry that day?

220
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:25,437
Probably the same people
who see him every day.

221
00:11:25,535 --> 00:11:26,929
the floor nurse, orderlies,

222
00:11:26,971 --> 00:11:29,013
What about other
patients? Visitors?

223
00:11:29,097 --> 00:11:31,355
Henry doesn't
have visitors.

224
00:11:36,169 --> 00:11:37,183
Good one.

225
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,312
You've been practicing.

226
00:11:42,355 --> 00:11:43,802
Good morning, elyse.

227
00:11:44,356 --> 00:11:45,168
Hello.

228
00:11:45,731 --> 00:11:47,378
How are you feeling?

229
00:11:48,105 --> 00:11:49,116
Wonderful.

230
00:11:49,394 --> 00:11:52,239
I sketched a butterfly
this morning.

231
00:11:52,518 --> 00:11:55,058
He just sat there, like
he was posing for me.

232
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:56,398
Very nice.

233
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:58,838
Take it.

234
00:12:00,467 --> 00:12:01,613
Thank you.

235
00:12:02,909 --> 00:12:04,568
And how are you, teresa?

236
00:12:05,217 --> 00:12:07,317
She hasn't said
a word today.

237
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:09,757
She won't
even look at me.

238
00:12:10,956 --> 00:12:13,717
I got into medicine to try
and cure people.

239
00:12:14,205 --> 00:12:15,918
I've become a warden.

240
00:12:16,504 --> 00:12:18,247
But I'm sure you didn't come here
to hear a lecture

241
00:12:18,288 --> 00:12:20,394
on the current state of
the medical profession.

242
00:12:20,533 --> 00:12:22,680
Doctor, we've seen
other cases...

243
00:12:22,778 --> 00:12:25,556
Who experienced the same
nightmare as henry.

244
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:28,197
We're trying to piece together the facts
behind the nightmare.

245
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,707
Dreams are rarely factual.

246
00:12:29,926 --> 00:12:32,709
But people do relive specific experiences
in their dreams.

247
00:12:32,778 --> 00:12:34,235
Yes, but dreams are complex,

248
00:12:34,345 --> 00:12:36,043
combinations
of fact and fantasy.

249
00:12:36,099 --> 00:12:37,310
Very rarely literal.

250
00:12:37,405 --> 00:12:39,134
So a cigar isn't
always a cigar.

251
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,824
These recurring images,
a yellow rain hat...?

252
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,271
...could mean many things.

253
00:12:43,349 --> 00:12:44,387
Different to each person.

254
00:12:44,466 --> 00:12:46,149
I'd like to find out
what it meant to henry.

255
00:12:46,259 --> 00:12:48,683
I'd be glad to ask him
in our next session.

256
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,868
I was thinking more
of a face-to-face.

257
00:12:51,026 --> 00:12:52,708
I'm afraid that
won't be possible.

258
00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:54,597
Doctor, i'm afraid
that isn't your call.

259
00:12:54,675 --> 00:12:56,217
We need to see him now.

260
00:13:02,197 --> 00:13:04,927
Henry will remain in his
restraints at all times.

261
00:13:05,122 --> 00:13:06,443
Don't approach him,

262
00:13:06,522 --> 00:13:08,631
and don't get him
too agitated.

263
00:13:09,382 --> 00:13:11,175
If you feel threatened
in any way,

264
00:13:11,254 --> 00:13:12,921
there's a panic button
by the door.

265
00:13:13,047 --> 00:13:15,175
I can have ten orderlies
to you in under a minute.

266
00:13:15,296 --> 00:13:17,812
Send seven,
i'm here.

267
00:13:18,157 --> 00:13:18,896
I need your weapon.

268
00:13:18,927 --> 00:13:21,444
And anything else
potentially dangerous.

269
00:13:28,867 --> 00:13:30,650
You gotta be prepared.

270
00:13:30,901 --> 00:13:32,993
You are not
prepared for this.

271
00:14:09,508 --> 00:14:10,782
What do you want?

272
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,063
To ask you
some questions.

273
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:16,420
Well, i'm kinda
busy right now.

274
00:14:16,487 --> 00:14:18,044
I can come back later.

275
00:14:18,846 --> 00:14:20,497
You another doctor?

276
00:14:24,235 --> 00:14:25,194
No.

277
00:14:25,304 --> 00:14:28,230
Writing a book about
psycho killers?

278
00:14:29,252 --> 00:14:30,101
No.

279
00:14:31,674 --> 00:14:32,863
Then it must be
my birthday,

280
00:14:32,926 --> 00:14:35,677
and they finally got me
what i always wanted.

281
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,695
Hope you're into bondage.

282
00:14:40,806 --> 00:14:42,457
Depends on the guy.

283
00:14:43,985 --> 00:14:46,637
I hear you rearranged
the cafeteria while back.

284
00:14:46,904 --> 00:14:49,122
So the doc tells me,
i don't remember.

285
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,289
You rember doing it
in your cell a week later?

286
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:51,984
No.

287
00:14:52,113 --> 00:14:54,986
Then again in the exercise yard,
and again in your cell...?

288
00:14:55,222 --> 00:14:56,213
I said no.

289
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,908
You're a cop.

290
00:15:07,361 --> 00:15:08,393
In a way.

291
00:15:08,613 --> 00:15:09,777
How many people
have you shot?

292
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:10,768
Why?

293
00:15:10,878 --> 00:15:13,158
Just trying to figure out
what we have in common.

294
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,886
I thought you
used a knife.

295
00:15:16,128 --> 00:15:18,361
They get just as
dead, don't they?

296
00:15:20,422 --> 00:15:22,262
Tell me about
the cafeteria.

297
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,331
You deaf?

298
00:15:23,764 --> 00:15:24,629
I told you i don't...

299
00:15:24,692 --> 00:15:25,919
I don't believe you.

300
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,212
Why does a cop even care
about some lunatic

301
00:15:30,307 --> 00:15:32,650
tossing around
a few chairs?

302
00:15:33,861 --> 00:15:36,094
Because you're
not the only one.

303
00:15:39,737 --> 00:15:40,985
What do you mean?

304
00:15:42,423 --> 00:15:44,319
Tell me about
the cafeteria.

305
00:15:44,445 --> 00:15:45,735
You tell me
what's going on.

306
00:15:45,798 --> 00:15:47,865
What the hell's
happening to me?

307
00:15:47,987 --> 00:15:49,921
You remember something, don't you ?

308
00:15:50,865 --> 00:15:53,381
Sounds, feelings, hein...

309
00:15:53,737 --> 00:15:56,196
A deep creaking noise.

310
00:15:56,715 --> 00:15:57,551
Get out!!

311
00:15:57,643 --> 00:15:58,935
Dr. Lewis!!!

312
00:15:59,082 --> 00:16:03,338
You're all alone in
a cold dark space.

313
00:16:03,464 --> 00:16:08,463
There's a light above you
and you have to get to it.

314
00:16:10,707 --> 00:16:11,556
Henry?

315
00:16:13,428 --> 00:16:14,843
Where are you?

316
00:16:19,656 --> 00:16:20,741
He's coming.

317
00:16:21,457 --> 00:16:22,524
Who is?

318
00:16:22,771 --> 00:16:23,892
Who's coming?

319
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,009
I can't...

320
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,085
I can't get out...

321
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,620
Jane, get out of there.

322
00:16:35,698 --> 00:16:37,397
Open the restraints!!!

323
00:16:37,995 --> 00:16:39,614
I have to see what the
nightmare makes him do.

324
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,124
It's the only way.

325
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,445
Do it now!!!

326
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:54,348
Where are we, henry?

327
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:55,826
Have to get out...

328
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:57,949
What do you see?

329
00:16:58,028 --> 00:16:58,814
A light.

330
00:16:58,895 --> 00:16:59,601
Up there.

331
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:00,812
I can't reach.

332
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:02,023
It's okay...

333
00:17:02,145 --> 00:17:03,501
Let me help you.

334
00:17:12,655 --> 00:17:14,197
There's someone here.

335
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:17,258
Can you see who it is?

336
00:17:18,611 --> 00:17:20,105
It's a... a man.

337
00:17:22,228 --> 00:17:23,628
Please, don't!

338
00:17:27,206 --> 00:17:28,963
You're seeing things.

339
00:17:29,734 --> 00:17:32,124
Flowers,
and a yellow rain hat.

340
00:17:33,257 --> 00:17:34,719
Tell me about the man.

341
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:37,015
Can you see who it is?

342
00:17:37,645 --> 00:17:39,113
What does he want?

343
00:17:39,412 --> 00:17:40,718
No!! Can't breathe!!

344
00:17:40,812 --> 00:17:42,133
Have to get out!!!

345
00:17:48,796 --> 00:17:50,715
Open the damn door!!

346
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:53,955
No, no, no, no !

347
00:17:59,676 --> 00:18:01,274
Do I need a prescriptionfor this ?

348
00:18:01,369 --> 00:18:03,555
Just drink it,
it'll calm your nerves.

349
00:18:06,024 --> 00:18:07,282
I did warn you.

350
00:18:10,178 --> 00:18:11,224
Yes, you did.

351
00:18:11,334 --> 00:18:12,593
Was it worth it?

352
00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:14,228
I'm not sure.

353
00:18:15,927 --> 00:18:21,483
He seemed to feel threatened
by someone's presence.

354
00:18:21,615 --> 00:18:23,125
But he didn't say who.

355
00:18:25,053 --> 00:18:25,720
No.

356
00:18:27,365 --> 00:18:28,749
It means something.

357
00:18:33,058 --> 00:18:33,530
Thank you, doctor.

358
00:18:33,577 --> 00:18:37,205
You should have someone take a look at those...
Oh yeah, but...

359
00:18:37,284 --> 00:18:39,707
The brandy works better
than you thought.

360
00:18:47,313 --> 00:18:48,618
Given what we know,

361
00:18:48,807 --> 00:18:51,669
the neuro had to get close to 
Henry Perkins to "infect" him.

362
00:18:51,779 --> 00:18:53,824
And we know where henry's
been for ten years.

363
00:18:53,997 --> 00:18:56,557
That should narrow down
the list of suspects.

364
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:00,925
These are the staff members on
duty that day at the institute.

365
00:19:01,053 --> 00:19:02,420
This is a list
of patients.

366
00:19:02,805 --> 00:19:05,542
This is the visitor's log.

367
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:09,938
Anybody on those lists have
any connection to our other victims?

368
00:19:10,064 --> 00:19:11,307
Of course not.

369
00:19:11,433 --> 00:19:12,525
That would be too easy.

370
00:19:12,644 --> 00:19:14,994
Then we yank dna
from all of 'em.

371
00:19:15,116 --> 00:19:16,142
Over 200 people?

372
00:19:16,205 --> 00:19:18,223
You know how long
that would take?

373
00:19:18,297 --> 00:19:20,291
I'll help with the women.

374
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,938
We can rule out
the patients.

375
00:19:24,049 --> 00:19:25,409
Most of the them are
restricted to the grounds.

376
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,054
They wouldn't have had
access to the other victims.

377
00:19:27,115 --> 00:19:28,578
We should check
the staff duty logs.

378
00:19:28,924 --> 00:19:30,641
See if anyone was
conveniently missing

379
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:32,050
on the days
the others were hit.

380
00:19:32,741 --> 00:19:33,770
Visitors, too.

381
00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:36,869
You gotta tell a fat
man to eat?

382
00:19:42,242 --> 00:19:44,657
Riley,
go get a coffee.

383
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,661
Sure, boss.

384
00:19:51,412 --> 00:19:52,339
Vasco...

385
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:55,233
Uh?

386
00:19:55,682 --> 00:19:57,121
You look like crap.

387
00:19:58,222 --> 00:20:00,565
Guess you're not
asking me to the prom.

388
00:20:01,729 --> 00:20:03,304
Go home get some sleep.

389
00:20:03,665 --> 00:20:05,695
You're no good
to me like this.

390
00:20:08,354 --> 00:20:10,240
How am i good to you?

391
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:14,202
Just go home and
get some sleep.

392
00:20:14,605 --> 00:20:15,617
Alright.

393
00:20:25,978 --> 00:20:27,419
Sleep, i rember that.

394
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:33,332
Something that used to happen somewhere
between lying down and getting up.

395
00:20:35,855 --> 00:20:39,502
Now when it comes,
if it comes,

396
00:20:39,544 --> 00:20:43,670
it's more like freddie's nightmare,
only without freddie.

397
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:49,416
It's just me and
my own special demons.

398
00:20:58,665 --> 00:20:59,653
Mom?

399
00:21:07,854 --> 00:21:08,903
I miss you.

400
00:21:35,479 --> 00:21:36,241
Get back!

401
00:21:36,477 --> 00:21:37,971
Please... We don't
have anything valuable.

402
00:21:38,029 --> 00:21:40,076
Shut up or i'll blow
your damn head off!!!!

403
00:21:40,418 --> 00:21:41,384
No, don't!

404
00:22:38,707 --> 00:22:41,884
Shut up or i'll blow
your damn head off!!

405
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:45,572
We tried to raise you
on your comm all morning.

406
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:47,396
Here, this'll warm
you up.

407
00:22:47,543 --> 00:22:48,922
Thanks.

408
00:22:49,043 --> 00:22:50,479
Damn neuro got in my head.

409
00:22:50,607 --> 00:22:55,566
But unlike the others, you seem to
heal quite quickly.

410
00:22:55,865 --> 00:22:56,819
How'd they get in?

411
00:22:56,929 --> 00:22:58,470
Popped your front lock.

412
00:22:58,668 --> 00:22:59,823
You need better security.

413
00:22:59,917 --> 00:23:01,741
It just doesn't
make sense.

414
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,213
I'd heard someone
coming into my apartment.

415
00:23:04,982 --> 00:23:06,381
Jane...

416
00:23:06,607 --> 00:23:09,175
What did you
have for dinner?

417
00:23:09,505 --> 00:23:10,056
The usual.

418
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:11,676
Salad, some wine, why?

419
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:16,237
There's some slow-acting narcotic
in your blood stream.

420
00:23:17,733 --> 00:23:20,122
No wonder you were acting
so strange last night.

421
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,693
What do you remember
about the nightmare?

422
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:24,863
Um...

423
00:23:26,858 --> 00:23:31,234
It started with my
mother, the funeral.

424
00:23:31,608 --> 00:23:34,254
That damn rain hat...

425
00:23:34,417 --> 00:23:37,761
Absolute terror.

426
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,347
There was a guy,
just like henry perkins said.

427
00:23:41,442 --> 00:23:43,628
Where was this?

428
00:23:43,982 --> 00:23:44,792
I don't know.

429
00:23:44,918 --> 00:23:46,286
But he had a gun.

430
00:23:46,418 --> 00:23:48,063
I knew i had to hide...

431
00:23:50,546 --> 00:23:51,494
Water!

432
00:23:52,044 --> 00:23:52,894
What about water?

433
00:23:53,019 --> 00:23:55,583
Wherever i was... It
was beginning to flood.

434
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,718
I had to hide but
then i had to get out.

435
00:23:57,864 --> 00:23:58,854
There was a window...

436
00:23:59,043 --> 00:24:01,068
That's what everyone's
been experiencing.

437
00:24:01,161 --> 00:24:03,756
They had to get to the window
because of the water.

438
00:24:03,872 --> 00:24:05,109
They were drowning.

439
00:24:05,247 --> 00:24:06,713
Would you stop!!!

440
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:09,339
Let me at least pretend
to take care of you.

441
00:24:11,497 --> 00:24:12,860
Her heart's racing.

442
00:24:12,939 --> 00:24:13,977
Sit down.

443
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:17,987
Probably not a coincidence
that the neuro chose

444
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:21,211
the lead agent on his trail
as his next victim.

445
00:24:21,384 --> 00:24:22,501
Someone we interviewed.

446
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:24,124
Not likely one of it's victims.

447
00:24:24,372 --> 00:24:25,983
The hospital staff.

448
00:24:26,061 --> 00:24:27,854
Dr. Lewis.

449
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,804
We need to do more
cross-checking.

450
00:24:29,867 --> 00:24:32,808
Who was at graymore when
perkins had his breakdown

451
00:24:33,033 --> 00:24:35,046
and who wasn't there when
the others were hit.

452
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:37,610
Have riley run
patient histories.

453
00:24:37,687 --> 00:24:39,025
See who's suffering from

454
00:24:39,104 --> 00:24:40,740
nightmares
involving drowning.

455
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,045
I'll do that.

456
00:24:42,436 --> 00:24:45,970
But i want you to follow
doctor's orders.

457
00:24:46,064 --> 00:24:47,244
I'm fine.

458
00:24:47,354 --> 00:24:48,015
Doc...

459
00:24:49,493 --> 00:24:51,837
If she gives
you any trouble.

460
00:24:52,623 --> 00:24:53,803
Shoot her.

461
00:24:59,491 --> 00:25:01,945
I can't place one person in
the vicinity of all the victims.

462
00:25:02,071 --> 00:25:03,848
We've got one nurse
who was out of town

463
00:25:03,911 --> 00:25:05,436
when alan sloane
flipped out.

464
00:25:05,562 --> 00:25:09,101
But she was on duty when
branton and cho lost it.

465
00:25:09,189 --> 00:25:11,022
Looks like dr. Lewis
travels a lot.

466
00:25:11,074 --> 00:25:14,424
Including the day Perkins did his thing
in the cafeteria.

467
00:25:14,504 --> 00:25:16,989
I'm telling you, nobody was in all
the right places

468
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:18,813
on the right days.

469
00:25:18,955 --> 00:25:21,215
I thought i told you
to get some r and r.

470
00:25:21,325 --> 00:25:23,008
Hard to r or r

471
00:25:23,134 --> 00:25:25,446
when someone's gotten
inside your head.

472
00:25:25,572 --> 00:25:27,302
Where are we on the
graymore psych staff?

473
00:25:27,437 --> 00:25:28,953
Nowhere.

474
00:25:29,179 --> 00:25:31,852
Our neuro must have tampered with
the records to cover his own tracks.

475
00:25:31,936 --> 00:25:34,211
Anyway to "untamper" them?

476
00:25:36,791 --> 00:25:37,813
Sorry i asked.

477
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:39,968
Did you give him
the lead about the water?

478
00:25:40,109 --> 00:25:41,914
About the drowning
nightmare?

479
00:25:41,993 --> 00:25:42,748
Yeah.

480
00:25:43,471 --> 00:25:45,060
I'm working on it.

481
00:25:45,233 --> 00:25:48,803
You know how many case histories
they've got at graymore?

482
00:25:48,882 --> 00:25:51,001
I found this one guy who kept on
dreaming that he was

483
00:25:51,034 --> 00:25:52,969
one of those, what he called,
those prima ballerina.

484
00:25:53,047 --> 00:25:56,078
- But his tutu kept on coming up...
- Riley

485
00:25:58,937 --> 00:26:01,173
I thought it was
interesting.

486
00:26:01,425 --> 00:26:02,443
Yeah, i know.

487
00:26:02,537 --> 00:26:04,597
Riley, get back to work.

488
00:26:06,532 --> 00:26:11,592
Alright, it looks like it's time for spent
on an another visit to "laughing academy."

489
00:26:16,435 --> 00:26:18,559
Hey what's going on?
Minor security issue.

490
00:26:18,574 --> 00:26:19,203
How minor?

491
00:26:19,266 --> 00:26:21,044
Some of the door locks in
a wing malfunctioned

492
00:26:21,107 --> 00:26:22,223
and the patients got
out of their rooms.

493
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,041
We're taking care of it.

494
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,268
We need to talk
to dr. Lewis.

495
00:26:24,331 --> 00:26:25,479
You and everyone else.

496
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:27,117
No one's seen him
since this morning.

497
00:26:27,141 --> 00:26:27,919
I have to go.

498
00:26:28,014 --> 00:26:28,942
That's convenient.

499
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,002
A security malfunction
that keeps everyone busy

500
00:26:31,065 --> 00:26:32,748
while dr. Lewis
goes awol?

501
00:26:32,826 --> 00:26:33,849
The brandy!

502
00:26:34,116 --> 00:26:35,927
It's a little early
for that, jane.

503
00:26:36,019 --> 00:26:37,550
Dr. Lewis gave me
that brandy

504
00:26:37,612 --> 00:26:39,388
before i went
home last night.

505
00:26:39,484 --> 00:26:43,274
Seth said someone slipped
me a slow-acting narcotic.

506
00:26:43,463 --> 00:26:44,640
If lewis was here
this morning,

507
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:46,860
he couldn't have
gotten that far.

508
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:53,841
What's up?

509
00:26:53,951 --> 00:26:55,603
I need a two hour
radius from graymore.

510
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:57,097
Assume by car.

511
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:01,031
Accounting for average
road speeds, traffic density,

512
00:27:01,141 --> 00:27:03,437
homeland security
checkpoints...

513
00:27:05,262 --> 00:27:06,772
There's your search area.

514
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,250
Checkpoints...

515
00:27:08,392 --> 00:27:10,625
It would take forever to go through
their logs for the past hour.

516
00:27:10,707 --> 00:27:12,056
Lewis is a doctor.

517
00:27:12,151 --> 00:27:13,487
He'd have an
emergency pass.

518
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,258
And he'd use it to blow
through the checkpoints.

519
00:27:15,532 --> 00:27:16,271
Riley...

520
00:27:16,332 --> 00:27:18,017
Flagging it in the logs.

521
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:21,473
Three emergency passes have
been used in the past hour.

522
00:27:21,551 --> 00:27:23,470
This one's a block
away from the airport.

523
00:27:23,533 --> 00:27:24,996
Alright,I gotta roll

524
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:25,793
Check to see...

525
00:27:25,887 --> 00:27:27,350
...if he booked any flight.

526
00:27:27,413 --> 00:27:28,498
Thank you.

527
00:27:28,592 --> 00:27:30,653
I have looks and brains.

528
00:27:36,393 --> 00:27:39,458
All i wanted was relief from a nightmare
that never seems to end.

529
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,274
By "offloading" it
to innocent people.

530
00:27:42,447 --> 00:27:46,174
But just enough to
give me some peace.

531
00:27:46,395 --> 00:27:50,437
When i discovered
that i could do that,

532
00:27:50,547 --> 00:27:52,812
i never gave the entire
nightmare to anyone.

533
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:53,975
Including you.

534
00:27:54,081 --> 00:27:55,957
So you're a good guy.

535
00:27:56,114 --> 00:27:57,942
If you knew what i
was going through...

536
00:27:58,037 --> 00:28:00,867
Henry perkins was
your first victim?

537
00:28:01,767 --> 00:28:02,377
Yes.

538
00:28:03,573 --> 00:28:05,646
You weren't away
at a medical conference?

539
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:07,111
I had been.

540
00:28:07,206 --> 00:28:09,708
When you asked to see
the institute records,

541
00:28:09,816 --> 00:28:11,671
i altered them to show that
i was still absent

542
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,842
at the time
of henry's breakdown.

543
00:28:14,502 --> 00:28:15,493
Why henry?

544
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:17,978
It wasn't intentional.

545
00:28:18,623 --> 00:28:20,183
He was being transferred
to the cafeteria,

546
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,876
and he stumbled
in the hall.

547
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,303
I reached out
to steady him.

548
00:28:25,184 --> 00:28:26,946
It was a moment
of contact...

549
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,289
But i suddenly felt
lighter somehow,

550
00:28:29,383 --> 00:28:31,385
as if a weight
had been lifted.

551
00:28:33,131 --> 00:28:34,814
I can't explain it.

552
00:28:37,645 --> 00:28:40,727
It took me a few days to
realize what happened to henry.

553
00:28:41,067 --> 00:28:45,144
That brief contact had passed part of
my nightmare to him.

554
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:48,070
So why stop with one.

555
00:28:49,674 --> 00:28:54,262
Relief from chronic suffering
can quickly become addictive.

556
00:28:55,441 --> 00:28:59,746
It was cowardly, it was
cruel and selfish.

557
00:29:00,202 --> 00:29:01,822
I can't deny that.

558
00:29:04,527 --> 00:29:05,565
I need to talk to you.

559
00:29:05,628 --> 00:29:07,049
In a moment, seth.

560
00:29:07,332 --> 00:29:08,008
Now.

561
00:29:20,729 --> 00:29:22,412
We've got
the wrong guy.

562
00:29:22,506 --> 00:29:23,796
Seth,the guy just confessed.

563
00:29:23,921 --> 00:29:26,784
And i've just been over his
genetic profile three times.

564
00:29:26,878 --> 00:29:28,866
That man
is not a neuro.

565
00:29:32,328 --> 00:29:35,128
Are you absolutely sure?
There's no margin for error

566
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:36,837
Sir, there's always
a margin for error.

567
00:29:36,947 --> 00:29:38,583
But, in this case,
i am sure.

568
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:40,675
Dr. Lewis
isn't a neuro.

569
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:44,858
Riley!

570
00:29:45,407 --> 00:29:46,083
Yo!

571
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,388
New deal.

572
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:52,007
So lewis, he's either being
controlled by a neuro

573
00:29:52,117 --> 00:29:53,895
or he's protecting the neuro.

574
00:29:53,973 --> 00:29:56,725
What was the destination
on that airline ticket?

575
00:29:56,847 --> 00:29:58,251
Richmond, virginia.

576
00:29:58,345 --> 00:30:00,380
Plane would've
landed two hours ago.

577
00:30:00,478 --> 00:30:02,411
Let's assume he's
protecting someone,

578
00:30:02,491 --> 00:30:04,087
he's gone a long
way to do it.

579
00:30:04,158 --> 00:30:05,558
Must be important to him.

580
00:30:05,621 --> 00:30:07,115
Lewis' personal
life is a blank.

581
00:30:07,178 --> 00:30:08,939
No family, no relatives.

582
00:30:09,034 --> 00:30:11,563
Ever get anywhere with
that drowning reference?

583
00:30:11,658 --> 00:30:13,010
Yeah,
one of the patients.

584
00:30:13,105 --> 00:30:14,772
Been there since
she was a kid.

585
00:30:14,882 --> 00:30:16,360
Seems her nightmares are
based on something

586
00:30:16,408 --> 00:30:18,027
that actually happened
to her and her family.

587
00:30:18,097 --> 00:30:20,465
Right,okay.
Can you get me a name?

588
00:30:20,575 --> 00:30:21,759
Yeah, one sec.

589
00:30:27,598 --> 00:30:28,711
Elyse danson.

590
00:30:29,985 --> 00:30:31,684
She's missing from
the hospital.

591
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:33,387
He was telling the truth.

592
00:30:34,598 --> 00:30:38,577
Everything he told us about offloading
that nightmare, is the truth,

593
00:30:38,672 --> 00:30:42,556
only it wasn't his,
it was elyse's.

594
00:30:49,847 --> 00:30:51,517
You're in love with elyse.

595
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,712
I sketched a butterfly
this morning.

596
00:30:57,757 --> 00:30:58,795
Very nice.

597
00:30:58,999 --> 00:30:59,896
Take it.

598
00:31:01,468 --> 00:31:02,444
Thank you.

599
00:31:04,787 --> 00:31:08,887
And after years of
trying to help her,

600
00:31:08,965 --> 00:31:12,551
you stumbled across
something that did.

601
00:31:13,086 --> 00:31:15,367
You think this crap is
going to get us anywhere?

602
00:31:15,467 --> 00:31:16,867
Give her a chance.

603
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:20,453
When she made brief contact
with henry that day...

604
00:31:21,302 --> 00:31:24,275
And then i saw henry
reliving elyse's nightmare...

605
00:31:24,904 --> 00:31:25,745
I didn't understand it...

606
00:31:25,849 --> 00:31:27,453
But i know what i saw.

607
00:31:30,284 --> 00:31:32,517
You can't imagine
what it was like.

608
00:31:33,036 --> 00:31:35,139
To see some relief
in her eyes.

609
00:31:35,568 --> 00:31:36,779
A brief smile.

610
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:38,907
A respite from the pain.

611
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:44,522
You've known elyse since
she was a little girl.

612
00:31:44,663 --> 00:31:47,667
She came to the institute
when she was... Eight?

613
00:31:48,099 --> 00:31:49,316
Nine years old.

614
00:31:51,164 --> 00:31:52,367
What happened?

615
00:31:52,724 --> 00:31:54,694
I still don't
know all of it.

616
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:59,373
The coast guard found her drifting off the
coast of maine, in a life raft

617
00:31:59,537 --> 00:32:03,368
she was curled up in the
bottom, shivering and alone.

618
00:32:03,478 --> 00:32:05,530
She doesn't remember
anything before that.

619
00:32:05,664 --> 00:32:08,359
But she dreams about
it, doesn't she?

620
00:32:08,415 --> 00:32:10,576
Horrible dreams that
plague her every night

621
00:32:10,686 --> 00:32:13,156
and haunt her when
she's awake.

622
00:32:13,659 --> 00:32:19,152
But the remarkable thing is how hard
she tries to look past her own pain,

623
00:32:19,285 --> 00:32:20,747
to sympathize with
the other patients,

624
00:32:20,795 --> 00:32:24,661
to make them smile even while
she's holding back tears.

625
00:32:26,326 --> 00:32:30,069
She can still see beauty through
her own darkness.

626
00:32:34,664 --> 00:32:38,309
Her gentleness has helped
patients in ways

627
00:32:38,475 --> 00:32:43,451
all our medications, research and
science can't even begin to reach.

628
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,934
If anyone in this world
deserves a moment's peace...

629
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:56,518
Dr. Lewis, if you feel as
strongly as you say you do,

630
00:32:56,612 --> 00:32:59,270
the best thing you
can do for elyse

631
00:32:59,398 --> 00:33:01,503
is to allow us
to bring her here.

632
00:33:04,407 --> 00:33:08,701
Why, so you can put one of those things
in her head like you did to me?

633
00:33:08,795 --> 00:33:12,523
The chip would only
makes a way that she couldn't pass

634
00:33:12,586 --> 00:33:13,513
her nightmare
to anybody else.

635
00:33:13,561 --> 00:33:16,077
And she'd continue
to suffer.

636
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:18,027
We can eliminate that, too.

637
00:33:20,056 --> 00:33:21,330
Is that possible?

638
00:33:21,523 --> 00:33:22,006
No.

639
00:33:24,084 --> 00:33:26,017
Maybe you should
let her know that.

640
00:33:26,336 --> 00:33:27,584
She already does.

641
00:33:27,773 --> 00:33:30,139
There is no cure for
elyse's condition.

642
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:32,176
I've tried everything.

643
00:33:32,271 --> 00:33:34,095
Everything you know.

644
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,499
But you see,

645
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:46,212
we have abilities here that are
beyond your wildest imagination.

646
00:33:47,175 --> 00:33:48,401
I know what you're
trying to do,

647
00:33:48,464 --> 00:33:49,770
but i won't turn
elyse over to you.

648
00:33:49,848 --> 00:33:53,057
No, i don't think you know
what i'm trying to do,

649
00:33:53,151 --> 00:33:55,526
i know what
they can do here.

650
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:58,808
I've seen them cure
people like elyse.

651
00:33:59,814 --> 00:34:02,236
I know what they've
done for me.

652
00:34:06,133 --> 00:34:06,872
You?

653
00:34:08,334 --> 00:34:11,559
How do you think i recovered
from the nightmare so quickly?

654
00:34:12,644 --> 00:34:14,342
She only made brief
contact with you...

655
00:34:14,468 --> 00:34:16,848
No, no, no, it wasn't
that and you know it.

656
00:34:17,961 --> 00:34:22,936
You'd have me permanently
eliminated and I know you tried.

657
00:34:24,774 --> 00:34:25,845
It's me,

658
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:31,155
and it's what the people
here did to me.

659
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,488
Oh, god!

660
00:34:36,771 --> 00:34:37,699
Oh, god!!

661
00:34:38,524 --> 00:34:40,796
I need some help in here!

662
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:49,881
How...?

663
00:34:52,392 --> 00:34:54,216
You tell me.

664
00:34:55,002 --> 00:34:58,352
Are you willing to take
a chance on a miracle?

665
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:02,296
Or are you going to keep elyse
on the run for the rest of her life.

666
00:35:06,541 --> 00:35:08,037
Let us help her.

667
00:35:15,166 --> 00:35:17,380
Damn if she
can't tell a lie.

668
00:35:25,604 --> 00:35:28,037
Two ways to get out,
one front, one back.

669
00:35:28,355 --> 00:35:30,921
If you go charging in,
you'll only scare her.

670
00:35:30,978 --> 00:35:33,111
She won't run if
she sees i'm alone.

671
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,415
Please.

672
00:35:36,604 --> 00:35:38,019
Elyse has been through
so much already.

673
00:35:38,098 --> 00:35:40,295
Let me make this
easy for her.

674
00:35:41,792 --> 00:35:42,958
Cover the back.

675
00:35:43,036 --> 00:35:44,169
Alright, you can
go alone.

676
00:35:44,231 --> 00:35:45,209
Thank you.

677
00:36:16,169 --> 00:36:18,410
We don't have too
much time, elyse.

678
00:36:23,228 --> 00:36:26,132
I thought you said we had
all the time in the world.

679
00:36:27,992 --> 00:36:33,323
Give me your pain,
all of it for good.

680
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:39,908
What's wrong?

681
00:36:41,041 --> 00:36:42,613
This isn't right.

682
00:36:42,818 --> 00:36:44,296
It's taking too long.

683
00:36:44,391 --> 00:36:45,759
I watched you
convince that man.

684
00:36:45,853 --> 00:36:47,017
He believed
everything you said.

685
00:36:47,062 --> 00:36:49,452
You sold him
on the "miracle cure."

686
00:36:49,547 --> 00:36:53,604
i'm beginning to wonder if
i'm not the one who got sold.

687
00:37:19,718 --> 00:37:20,850
What is that?

688
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:29,293
Stay quiet.

689
00:37:32,548 --> 00:37:33,743
Give it back!!

690
00:37:33,856 --> 00:37:34,420
Please...

691
00:37:34,498 --> 00:37:35,543
We don't have
anything valuable.

692
00:37:35,646 --> 00:37:38,210
Shut up or i'll blow
your damn head off!!!

693
00:38:28,312 --> 00:38:29,570
Mommy, mommy!!

694
00:38:32,606 --> 00:38:33,563
Daddy!!!!

695
00:38:51,107 --> 00:38:53,314
This isn't right,
let's go in now!

696
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,717
Pain is pain,

697
00:39:28,828 --> 00:39:30,572
what i saw when i went
through that door,

698
00:39:30,635 --> 00:39:33,293
was as raw as anything
i had ever seen before.

699
00:39:35,118 --> 00:39:36,998
And never wanted
to see again.

700
00:39:44,233 --> 00:39:45,742
We have to be quiet.

701
00:39:57,482 --> 00:39:59,722
There's nothing
valuable in here...

702
00:40:00,261 --> 00:40:02,274
There's nothing
valuable here!!!!

703
00:40:05,954 --> 00:40:07,787
There's nothing
valuable here...

704
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:45,229
Do you have any idea what
that man just did for you?

705
00:40:49,837 --> 00:40:51,614
That's dr. Lewis,
right?

706
00:40:52,641 --> 00:40:54,805
The nice man
from the hospital.

707
00:41:01,596 --> 00:41:03,011
So what is so important.

708
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:05,512
I've been looking deeper
into jane's dna

709
00:41:05,905 --> 00:41:08,856
if we compare these two
samples, here and here.

710
00:41:08,971 --> 00:41:10,774
You see the similarity.

711
00:41:10,846 --> 00:41:12,033
If you say so.

712
00:41:12,898 --> 00:41:14,974
It's by no means
an exact match

713
00:41:15,351 --> 00:41:17,994
but the trace
markers are evident.

714
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,392
And the point is?

715
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:23,310
The sample on the right was
taken from Ruben Hennesey,

716
00:41:23,432 --> 00:41:26,027
the telekinetic neuro you
apprehended last week.

717
00:41:26,377 --> 00:41:28,215
This one is from jane.

718
00:41:29,629 --> 00:41:32,576
It took me a while because i was looking
at the wrong cell quadrant.

719
00:41:32,713 --> 00:41:34,577
Even then, it's
not an exact match.

720
00:41:34,714 --> 00:41:36,643
What's your
conclusion, doctor?

721
00:41:40,926 --> 00:41:43,326
There's no missing
the fact that jane's dna

722
00:41:43,402 --> 00:41:45,787
contains very similar
indicator points

723
00:41:45,848 --> 00:41:48,020
to those
we find in neuros.

724
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:52,956
Does she know?

725
00:41:58,097 --> 00:41:59,674
I haven't told her.

726
00:42:01,033 --> 00:42:01,922
Don't.

727
00:42:12,925 --> 00:42:15,374
It's tough when
someone you love hurts,

728
00:42:15,488 --> 00:42:19,582
you hear them say, if i could take on
your pain, I would.

729
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:23,835
Well, i bet if half of them knew
what it felt like, they wouldn't.

730
00:42:23,986 --> 00:42:27,979
Dr. Lewis had the opportunity to do just that,
and he took it.

731
00:42:28,114 --> 00:42:30,121
Maybe the ultimate
expression of love,

732
00:42:30,236 --> 00:42:32,961
even if it left him
mentally destroyed,

733
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,209
i don't know if
i could do that.

734
00:42:35,299 --> 00:42:37,924
Then again, before i was pushed
out that window,

735
00:42:37,986 --> 00:42:39,051
i don't know
if i could take on

736
00:42:39,156 --> 00:42:41,237
my boyfriend's
in-grown toenail.

737
00:42:41,298 --> 00:42:42,330
You okay?

738
00:42:42,604 --> 00:42:43,606
I'm better.

739
00:42:44,457 --> 00:42:46,022
You look better.

740
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:48,923
Some things never change.

741
00:42:49,044 --> 00:42:50,609
That boyfriend's long gone.

742
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:54,315
Maureen's still here and i
still don't open up to anyone.

743
00:42:54,421 --> 00:42:56,928
Which means, what
it always meant,

744
00:42:56,988 --> 00:43:00,159
i'm going to continue
suffering internal pain

745
00:43:00,238 --> 00:43:02,514
before the truck runs me over.

746
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,600
