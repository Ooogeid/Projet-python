1
00:00:00,795 --> 00:00:02,293
My name is jane vasco.

2
00:00:02,349 --> 00:00:03,555
I could use
you on my team.

3
00:00:03,668 --> 00:00:07,217
I work for a secret government
agency that hunts neuros.

4
00:00:07,264 --> 00:00:10,605
People who can do dangerous
things with their minds.

5
00:00:11,362 --> 00:00:12,850
On my first assignment..

6
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:14,965
Something a little
weird happened,

7
00:00:15,105 --> 00:00:17,999
okay, something
really weird.

8
00:00:18,595 --> 00:00:21,508
Until i get some answers
i'm getting on with my life,

9
00:00:21,863 --> 00:00:22,939
doing my job.

10
00:00:23,344 --> 00:00:24,912
Stocking up on aspirin,

11
00:00:25,281 --> 00:00:27,943
because I gotta tell ya,

12
00:00:28,692 --> 00:00:29,927
pain's a bitch!

13
00:00:55,554 --> 00:00:56,845
suck it in, tammy, or
we'll never get

14
00:00:56,892 --> 00:00:58,483
all of you zipped up...

15
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:00,641
Caitlin, you're supposed
to wear the outfit,

16
00:01:00,678 --> 00:01:01,487
not wrestle it.

17
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,484
Relax...

18
00:01:05,638 --> 00:01:06,695
Undo the top.

19
00:01:06,742 --> 00:01:08,363
I want the audience to see
that some part of you

20
00:01:08,407 --> 00:01:10,175
still looks
like a woman..

21
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:18,906
Lose the candy on
the runway, shannon.

22
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,750
It makes you look like
a chipmunk gathering nuts

23
00:01:20,796 --> 00:01:21,985
for the winter.

24
00:01:24,178 --> 00:01:26,188
Chipmunks are
adorable, geoffrey.

25
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,298
So are you, shannon..

26
00:01:27,367 --> 00:01:28,602
Just ignore him.

27
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,998
Sweetie, it's good
to be nervous.

28
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:38,000
Use that energy
on the runway.

29
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:41,415
Turn it into something
hot, dangerous, sexy.

30
00:01:41,596 --> 00:01:42,747
Make it yours.

31
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:43,800
Understand?

32
00:01:47,192 --> 00:01:48,745
Arlene hasn't been
hot and dangerous,

33
00:01:48,802 --> 00:01:50,503
since madonna
had a career.

34
00:01:50,554 --> 00:01:51,552
You watch me work.

35
00:01:51,639 --> 00:01:53,037
I'll show you hot
and dangerous...

36
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:54,334
And very sexy.

37
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,751
The beautiful katie heads
off fiddels's new collection

38
00:02:02,807 --> 00:02:04,379
with this flowing outfit

39
00:02:04,436 --> 00:02:06,675
representing flight
and freedom of spring

40
00:02:06,712 --> 00:02:08,584
adding a nordic influence.

41
00:02:11,836 --> 00:02:15,590
Next eve shows us a continuing
european theme here

42
00:02:15,647 --> 00:02:18,838
as this lovely blouse
adding a bavarian flare

43
00:02:18,903 --> 00:02:20,456
to a sexy summer look.

44
00:02:22,587 --> 00:02:25,274
And joelle gives
us a modern update

45
00:02:25,339 --> 00:02:26,687
that hips up evening ware

46
00:02:26,716 --> 00:02:28,217
for a less traditional
urban look

47
00:02:28,245 --> 00:02:30,453
that still remains classic.

48
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:36,161
The wonderful flowing design
here worn by rebecca

49
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,186
is equally at home in town
or out on the beach.

50
00:02:44,358 --> 00:02:46,413
And yes, the stunning
wanda show us that

51
00:02:46,478 --> 00:02:48,144
fairytales do come true.

52
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,609
With the classically
influencing gown and

53
00:02:50,646 --> 00:02:52,798
the beautiful flowing satin.

54
00:03:05,984 --> 00:03:08,406
And with a more modern
take on evening ware,

55
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:09,931
shannon shows off...

56
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:28,356
You okay?

57
00:03:33,274 --> 00:03:34,794
Excuse me, excuse me,
where is she?

58
00:03:34,846 --> 00:03:35,731
Right over here.

59
00:03:35,764 --> 00:03:36,849
What happened?

60
00:03:37,195 --> 00:03:39,095
Can you tell me
what happened.

61
00:03:39,173 --> 00:03:40,686
She collapsed
on the runway,

62
00:03:40,723 --> 00:03:41,911
she's only 19.

63
00:03:42,295 --> 00:03:43,295
My god!!!

65
00:03:58,861 --> 00:04:01,416
When I was a girl,
my grandmother gave me a book

66
00:04:01,538 --> 00:04:02,736
of fairy tales.

67
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:05,655
What I learned from those
stories was that men had

68
00:04:05,702 --> 00:04:08,607
to be brave, handsome
prince charmings.

69
00:04:08,673 --> 00:04:11,677
And any woman who wanted
a prince charming to want her

70
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:14,063
had to be
kind and pure...

71
00:04:14,184 --> 00:04:16,940
And beautiful,
mostly beautiful.

72
00:04:17,361 --> 00:04:19,345
No prince worth his
kingdom would've kissed

73
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,592
sleeping beauty if she
hadn't been just... Perfect.

74
00:04:24,023 --> 00:04:25,165
I'm grown up now.

75
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,943
Don't believe
in fairy tales.

76
00:04:26,987 --> 00:04:27,991
Or princes.

77
00:04:28,421 --> 00:04:31,425
And i'm a few light
years from perfect.

78
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:36,498
It's just a bruise.

79
00:04:36,554 --> 00:04:38,762
'Normal' people get
them all the time.

80
00:04:39,108 --> 00:04:41,374
But, since I'm 'abnormal',
when something doesn't heal,

81
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:42,930
it's not normal.

82
00:04:42,987 --> 00:04:44,914
It's abnormal.

83
00:04:48,172 --> 00:04:51,429
And just trying to wrap my
brain around this weirdness

84
00:04:51,487 --> 00:04:52,946
gives me a headache.

85
00:04:53,302 --> 00:04:54,724
You're having headaches?

86
00:04:54,799 --> 00:04:56,465
A figure of speech, seth.

87
00:04:57,736 --> 00:04:58,985
How have you been
feeling lately?

88
00:04:59,010 --> 00:04:59,986
Physically?

89
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,049
Emotionally?

90
00:05:02,237 --> 00:05:04,933
It's amazing what goes on
in my head sometimes.

91
00:05:05,298 --> 00:05:06,678
You sleeping all right?

92
00:05:06,734 --> 00:05:07,670
Rarely.

93
00:05:08,428 --> 00:05:09,916
It's hard to go to sleep.

94
00:05:09,981 --> 00:05:11,525
Hard to stay asleep.

95
00:05:12,508 --> 00:05:13,986
Lots of dreams.

96
00:05:14,551 --> 00:05:15,551
About?

97
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,446
Vampires.

98
00:05:18,488 --> 00:05:19,425
Zombies.

99
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:21,272
Things that don't die.

100
00:05:22,957 --> 00:05:24,521
It's sort of an
obsession of mine.

101
00:05:24,587 --> 00:05:26,121
I know how hard
this is for you.

102
00:05:26,177 --> 00:05:28,386
What's hard is not knowing
why i can take six bullets

103
00:05:28,442 --> 00:05:29,175
and live...

104
00:05:29,237 --> 00:05:31,193
And why a bruise
won't go away.

105
00:05:32,651 --> 00:05:34,822
Right now, i'm wondering
how your state of mind

106
00:05:34,925 --> 00:05:37,461
affects your body's
ability to heal itself.

107
00:05:37,994 --> 00:05:39,964
You think there's
a connection?

108
00:05:40,118 --> 00:05:41,171
I thought it was
something that...

109
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,175
Just happened.

110
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,447
We know what goes on in our
brains can affect our bodies.

111
00:05:45,503 --> 00:05:49,744
But i've never done
anything to make it happen.

112
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:52,037
You haven't, but...

113
00:05:53,347 --> 00:05:55,163
But perhaps your
mind has.

114
00:05:55,613 --> 00:05:57,971
That makes me sound
more and more like a...

115
00:05:58,017 --> 00:06:00,057
Don't jump
to conclusions, jane.

116
00:06:00,638 --> 00:06:03,134
Maybe you should just
try and get some rest.

117
00:06:03,976 --> 00:06:05,651
It started with one
isolated incident

118
00:06:05,707 --> 00:06:07,045
that caught my attention.

119
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:09,235
The more i looked into it,
the stranger it got...

120
00:06:09,272 --> 00:06:10,451
Look at this:

121
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:13,969
katherine cost,
amanda smart,

122
00:06:14,025 --> 00:06:16,758
shannon conway
and carolyn merrit

123
00:06:16,832 --> 00:06:18,273
were all fashion models.

124
00:06:18,331 --> 00:06:19,864
All young, beautiful...

125
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,979
Carolyn merritt?

126
00:06:21,054 --> 00:06:22,664
The babe who wore
the purple thong

127
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,657
in the 2005 swimsuit issue?

128
00:06:24,825 --> 00:06:26,219
I was so wrong.

129
00:06:26,809 --> 00:06:27,979
You do read.

130
00:06:28,867 --> 00:06:30,819
That Carolyn Merritt.

131
00:06:30,866 --> 00:06:32,063
They all knew each other.

132
00:06:32,101 --> 00:06:33,795
They'd all worked
together...

133
00:06:33,841 --> 00:06:35,189
Now they are all dead.

134
00:06:35,226 --> 00:06:36,330
What happened to them?

135
00:06:36,387 --> 00:06:38,176
They died of old age.

136
00:06:39,551 --> 00:06:42,790
Margeaux, katie, amanda,
shannon and carolyn.

137
00:06:43,145 --> 00:06:44,848
The oldest
girl was 23,

138
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:46,394
the youngest 19.

139
00:06:46,488 --> 00:06:48,621
Shannon conway was
the most recent...

140
00:06:48,724 --> 00:06:50,630
She died after the first
big show of the new season.

141
00:06:51,303 --> 00:06:53,552
How do young women
die of old age?

142
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:56,229
The first medical diagnosis
was a segmental progeria

143
00:06:56,285 --> 00:06:58,550
some sort of
accelerated aging disease.

144
00:06:58,737 --> 00:07:01,909
NIH and CDC, they all checked out
all the usual suspects:

145
00:07:01,975 --> 00:07:06,300
hutchinson-gilford, de barsy
syndrome, cockayne, gottron's.

146
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:10,109
They're genetic disorders,
but here's the thing.

147
00:07:10,277 --> 00:07:11,842
None of the girls' DNA

148
00:07:11,907 --> 00:07:14,593
presented any of the
expected genetic mutations.

149
00:07:14,676 --> 00:07:16,633
And progerias kill
at a very young age.

150
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,372
Slowly.

151
00:07:17,428 --> 00:07:19,420
These women were all healthy
one minute,

152
00:07:19,536 --> 00:07:21,800
rapidly aged and dead
the next.

153
00:07:21,912 --> 00:07:24,561
You see the progression
from left to right.

154
00:07:25,281 --> 00:07:26,618
You said they
worked together.

155
00:07:26,674 --> 00:07:28,920
What about exposure
to radioactive material,

156
00:07:28,985 --> 00:07:30,108
Chemical toxines... ?

157
00:07:30,239 --> 00:07:31,177
No.

158
00:07:31,362 --> 00:07:33,177
I created lifestyle
and biographical

159
00:07:33,233 --> 00:07:34,515
profiles on each girl,

160
00:07:34,553 --> 00:07:36,238
I cross-referenced
everything I could.

161
00:07:36,302 --> 00:07:40,047
and so far, no statistically
significant commonalities.

162
00:07:40,112 --> 00:07:41,619
I am still working but...

163
00:07:41,684 --> 00:07:44,425
If it walks like a neuro,
talks like a neuro...

164
00:07:44,503 --> 00:07:45,083
Riley, you said.

165
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,506
This season's circuit
is just underway.

166
00:07:47,553 --> 00:07:50,014
I think we'll have to investigate
this from the inside.

167
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,092
How inside is inside?

168
00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:55,348
I'll have your bios and resumes
finished this afternoon.

169
00:07:55,853 --> 00:07:57,669
Don't trip on the runway.

170
00:08:20,013 --> 00:08:21,179
What's wrong?

171
00:08:21,304 --> 00:08:23,194
I have to ask
you something.

172
00:08:25,328 --> 00:08:26,494
Sure.

173
00:08:29,007 --> 00:08:30,504
How do i look to you?

174
00:08:31,065 --> 00:08:33,554
And not, not because
we like each other...

175
00:08:34,191 --> 00:08:35,510
But objectively.

176
00:08:38,925 --> 00:08:42,060
Would the average
man rather be with

177
00:08:42,135 --> 00:08:43,909
some bony little twig

178
00:08:43,943 --> 00:08:46,657
who wears a size zero
pink thong bikini?

179
00:08:46,713 --> 00:08:48,948
Or this?

180
00:08:49,539 --> 00:08:50,512
The truth.

181
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:52,194
I'm a grown woman.

182
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,195
I can take it.

183
00:08:53,778 --> 00:08:54,635
So go on.

184
00:08:54,695 --> 00:08:56,445
Hit me with
your best shot.

185
00:09:05,289 --> 00:09:06,907
I'm sorry.

186
00:09:07,095 --> 00:09:08,606
I put you on the spot.

187
00:09:08,643 --> 00:09:10,786
You don't want
to hurt my feelings.

188
00:09:11,132 --> 00:09:15,025
Now you think i'm a silly,
vain, insecure woman,

189
00:09:15,072 --> 00:09:16,344
with low self-esteem.

190
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,361
Can i say something?

191
00:09:17,418 --> 00:09:18,896
No, I think you've
said enough.

192
00:09:18,943 --> 00:09:20,122
No, you have.

193
00:09:20,634 --> 00:09:21,834
Can i get some
air time, here?

194
00:09:23,422 --> 00:09:24,634
Fine.

195
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:25,698
The truth.

196
00:09:25,947 --> 00:09:27,391
No lip service.

197
00:09:28,632 --> 00:09:31,263
But it's the lips
that tell the truth.

198
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:41,632
You're, like, here.

199
00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:45,070
This is where i,
like, live...

200
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,345
And you don't.

201
00:09:46,638 --> 00:09:48,218
Don't you ever knock.

202
00:09:48,442 --> 00:09:49,027
No.

203
00:09:49,073 --> 00:09:49,822
Right.

204
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,231
I just came by to borrow
something to wear.

205
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,272
I met a new guy

206
00:09:53,319 --> 00:09:55,237
and I plan to get lucky.

207
00:09:55,284 --> 00:09:56,618
So, I want to look hot.

208
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,766
Help yourself.

209
00:09:58,883 --> 00:10:00,365
I'm sure i've got
something that goes

210
00:10:00,427 --> 00:10:01,749
with combat boots.

211
00:10:01,819 --> 00:10:02,673
Cool...

212
00:10:02,732 --> 00:10:03,644
Thanks!

213
00:10:10,306 --> 00:10:12,095
My neighbor, amanda.

214
00:10:12,247 --> 00:10:15,932
She has some issues
with boundaries.

215
00:10:16,025 --> 00:10:17,008
And doors.

216
00:10:17,196 --> 00:10:18,548
She just wants to
feel like someone's

217
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:19,571
taking care of her.

218
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,305
So do i.

219
00:10:34,304 --> 00:10:36,032
No, no!!!

220
00:10:36,116 --> 00:10:38,056
Ladies!!!

221
00:10:39,554 --> 00:10:40,926
New guppies in the pond.

222
00:10:40,995 --> 00:10:44,095
Win a contest or was
it "make a wish?"

223
00:10:44,165 --> 00:10:45,826
i've got your
wish right here.

224
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:46,925
Save it.

225
00:10:47,587 --> 00:10:50,037
Fear's like blood
in the water,

226
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:53,887
and we're surrounded
by sharks.

227
00:11:08,094 --> 00:11:10,714
At least everyone's having
a really good time.

228
00:11:15,147 --> 00:11:17,487
Now i know how hef felt
at the mansion.

229
00:11:17,884 --> 00:11:19,323
Goldfish.

230
00:11:19,381 --> 00:11:20,270
Barrel.

231
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,251
Riley...

232
00:11:23,309 --> 00:11:26,257
You picking up a feed from
all the surveillance cams?

233
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,046
I'm hot, boss.

234
00:11:37,636 --> 00:11:39,515
The only way i can
get into this dress

235
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:41,363
is if i paint it on.

236
00:11:42,322 --> 00:11:45,378
Demarco designs his dress for girls
with single digit bmis.

237
00:11:45,512 --> 00:11:47,062
You're just too healthy.

238
00:11:48,653 --> 00:11:49,624
Good luck.

239
00:11:52,949 --> 00:11:54,132
It's not your skin...

240
00:11:54,198 --> 00:11:55,606
It's your skivvies.

241
00:11:55,922 --> 00:11:57,045
Bra, panties.

242
00:11:57,325 --> 00:11:58,437
History.

243
00:11:58,577 --> 00:11:59,887
I don't think so.

244
00:11:59,946 --> 00:12:01,899
Demarco will not
be pleased.

245
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,385
Go away, geoffrey.

246
00:12:03,466 --> 00:12:05,033
I'll make demarco happy.

247
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,261
I always do.

248
00:12:06,507 --> 00:12:08,039
I'm glad someone can.

249
00:12:08,963 --> 00:12:11,396
He's a pain,
but he's right.

250
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:13,852
And the dress is discrete.

251
00:12:14,751 --> 00:12:16,833
For a hooker
in times square.

252
00:12:17,055 --> 00:12:18,026
It's just your
body, honey,

253
00:12:18,073 --> 00:12:19,336
it's not who you are.

254
00:12:19,383 --> 00:12:21,208
That's one of the two most
important things you need

255
00:12:21,266 --> 00:12:22,260
to know in this business.

256
00:12:22,319 --> 00:12:23,627
I like that.

257
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:24,698
What's the second?

258
00:12:24,984 --> 00:12:27,651
Without a beautiful
body, you're worthless.

259
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:31,008
Enjoy it while you can.

260
00:12:40,239 --> 00:12:41,830
Kirsten shows us the most

261
00:12:41,888 --> 00:12:43,350
important aspect in spring ware.

262
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,432
Colour, colour, colour...

263
00:12:45,491 --> 00:12:48,485
In this beautiful floral blowing dress.

264
00:12:52,228 --> 00:12:55,550
Candy shows us
this beautiful summer style...

265
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,976
Even over
a simple black outfit.

266
00:12:58,058 --> 00:13:01,403
Take it off your neckline and
you're ready to hit the club!

267
00:13:01,496 --> 00:13:04,023
Jane, you're up
in three minutes.

268
00:13:21,241 --> 00:13:22,645
Is It possible to stay

269
00:13:22,692 --> 00:13:24,046
fashionable come rain or shine?

270
00:13:24,563 --> 00:13:27,437
Wanda certainly does in this
simple yet stylish look

271
00:13:27,511 --> 00:13:30,125
that has her
looking hot and dry.

272
00:13:31,034 --> 00:13:33,210
Is on in 30 seconds,
has anybody seen her?

273
00:13:34,566 --> 00:13:35,830
Nobody is there.

274
00:13:41,844 --> 00:13:42,475
Go.

275
00:13:42,967 --> 00:13:46,873
Maureen shows this tropical
colour in this gorgeous

276
00:13:47,029 --> 00:13:48,029
expressionist influence.

277
00:14:03,267 --> 00:14:04,893
And the lovely jane...

278
00:14:38,603 --> 00:14:40,629
Jane is certainly
turning heads on the runway

279
00:14:40,676 --> 00:14:42,781
and will turn surely
more on the finest restaurants

280
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,348
as well
as the most happening parties

281
00:14:44,594 --> 00:14:46,220
in this stunning outfit.

282
00:14:59,286 --> 00:15:01,366
I went into the dressing
room to put on the dress...

283
00:15:01,472 --> 00:15:02,832
Came out and looked
in the mirror.

284
00:15:02,976 --> 00:15:05,620
I'd put on 20 years
in five minutes.

285
00:15:05,726 --> 00:15:06,825
You seem fine now.

286
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:07,849
All healed.

287
00:15:07,911 --> 00:15:08,911
There's a shocker.

288
00:15:09,412 --> 00:15:10,919
So what does this mean?

289
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:13,951
I live forever?

290
00:15:14,145 --> 00:15:16,449
You can reverse whatever
dna damage the neuro

291
00:15:16,535 --> 00:15:17,535
might have inflicted...

292
00:15:17,599 --> 00:15:18,724
I don't know if you
can reverse

293
00:15:18,765 --> 00:15:19,805
the 'normal' aging process.

294
00:15:22,099 --> 00:15:23,099
The bruise has healed.

295
00:15:24,096 --> 00:15:25,628
You look better.

296
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:28,330
We've got three dozen
possibles who were in that

297
00:15:28,412 --> 00:15:29,418
room with you.

298
00:15:29,476 --> 00:15:30,037
Did you get close to anyone?

299
00:15:30,131 --> 00:15:31,038
Are you kidding?

300
00:15:31,195 --> 00:15:33,523
It was like a tokyo
subway car at rush hour.

301
00:15:33,593 --> 00:15:35,525
I got close to everyone.

302
00:15:35,598 --> 00:15:37,278
Riley's looking over
surveillance footage.

303
00:15:37,348 --> 00:15:40,390
I'm hoping he can isolate
something, or someone, unusual.

304
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:41,225
Backstage.

305
00:15:41,303 --> 00:15:42,035
On the runway...

306
00:15:42,098 --> 00:15:43,537
I'll tell you this though,

307
00:15:43,601 --> 00:15:45,660
our neuro must have been damn
shocked to see you come out

308
00:15:45,703 --> 00:15:46,662
on the runway.

309
00:15:47,099 --> 00:15:49,059
Have to wonder what
the reaction will be to that.

310
00:15:50,913 --> 00:15:53,247
The surveillance cams
picked up 86 people,

311
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:55,497
including the models,
at the fashion show.

312
00:15:55,566 --> 00:15:58,363
But only three of them
were present for the other...

313
00:15:58,443 --> 00:15:59,439
Incidents.

314
00:16:00,316 --> 00:16:01,318
Geoffrey graham.

315
00:16:02,632 --> 00:16:05,065
It's not your skin,
it's your skivvies.

316
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:06,319
Bra, panties, history.

317
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,879
I don't think so.

318
00:16:10,257 --> 00:16:12,119
Thanks for the replay,
riley.

319
00:16:12,193 --> 00:16:13,943
It's one of my
favorite memories.

320
00:16:14,025 --> 00:16:16,107
It'll be in my
top ten, too...

321
00:16:20,098 --> 00:16:21,256
Wanda norton.

322
00:16:22,072 --> 00:16:25,748
Demarco designs for girls
with single digit bmis.

323
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,432
You're just too healthy.

324
00:16:27,502 --> 00:16:28,507
Good luck.

325
00:16:30,071 --> 00:16:31,132
Arlene watson.

326
00:16:31,225 --> 00:16:32,664
The show coordinator.

327
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,167
Without a beautiful body,
you're worthless.

328
00:16:37,261 --> 00:16:39,050
Enjoy it while you can.

329
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,124
It's show time.

330
00:16:41,194 --> 00:16:42,972
We need dna from
all three of them.

331
00:16:43,042 --> 00:16:43,966
I'll takes dibs on wanda.

332
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:45,580
Jane,
you take wanda.

333
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,352
You can handle arlene.

334
00:16:48,819 --> 00:16:50,235
You'll get geoffrey.

335
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:52,190
To date, all the victims
are women.

336
00:16:52,258 --> 00:16:54,338
We don't know if our neuro
requires physical contact

337
00:16:54,377 --> 00:16:55,605
or merely proximity.

338
00:16:55,694 --> 00:16:57,094
You're telling us
to be careful.

339
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,192
What else is new!

340
00:16:58,272 --> 00:16:59,900
We know jane can recover.

341
00:17:00,193 --> 00:17:02,263
Bring a chip gun with
you just in case.

342
00:17:02,318 --> 00:17:04,649
Connor, as to how you
want to handle geoffrey,

343
00:17:04,696 --> 00:17:06,462
i'll leave that up
to you.

344
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:16,444
Jane, are you home?

345
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,965
It's me amanda.

346
00:17:34,092 --> 00:17:35,835
The dress was totally hot,

347
00:17:35,928 --> 00:17:38,665
which means i didn't
have it on for very long.

348
00:17:38,735 --> 00:17:42,888
You have anything i could wear
to a soiree tomorrow night?

349
00:17:44,374 --> 00:17:45,403
Whatever.

350
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:55,531
You want to know what kind
of a career modeling is.

351
00:17:55,988 --> 00:17:57,906
That's not
the right question.

352
00:17:57,988 --> 00:17:59,473
Not even close.

353
00:17:59,894 --> 00:18:00,690
What is.

354
00:18:00,736 --> 00:18:03,733
Modeling isn't a career,
sweetie, it's life.

355
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:06,259
Every day 24/7.

356
00:18:06,306 --> 00:18:07,803
There's nothing else.

357
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:12,317
It's consuming, addictive
and very seductive.

358
00:18:14,491 --> 00:18:17,596
It's also degrading
and humiliating.

359
00:18:18,496 --> 00:18:21,650
You're just a beautiful
means to an end,

360
00:18:21,826 --> 00:18:23,674
a lovely commodity
like the fabrics

361
00:18:23,743 --> 00:18:25,802
that make
the clothes you wear.

362
00:18:26,058 --> 00:18:30,835
And you are expected
to be perfect every day 24/7.

363
00:18:31,055 --> 00:18:31,932
That's impossible.

364
00:18:31,991 --> 00:18:33,266
It's insane.

365
00:18:33,429 --> 00:18:35,184
The models cry on my
shoulder every day.

366
00:18:35,244 --> 00:18:36,716
I hear all
the horror stories.

367
00:18:36,814 --> 00:18:38,837
Models sacrifice real
lives for 15 minutes

368
00:18:38,931 --> 00:18:40,323
of fantasy and illusion.

369
00:18:40,428 --> 00:18:42,922
But, when they
can't sell schmata,

370
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:47,074
they're useless and invisible.

371
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,622
And for a model, being
invisible is a death

372
00:18:50,727 --> 00:18:52,295
a lot worse than dying.

373
00:18:54,244 --> 00:18:56,576
I have an appointment
with a designer.

374
00:18:56,716 --> 00:18:58,190
I still sell beauty.

375
00:18:58,683 --> 00:18:59,724
Only now...

376
00:19:00,227 --> 00:19:01,292
Not mine.

377
00:19:20,085 --> 00:19:22,200
Hey, you were
at demarco's show?

378
00:19:23,404 --> 00:19:24,724
That depends.

379
00:19:24,806 --> 00:19:25,809
What are you?

380
00:19:25,881 --> 00:19:27,330
I was doing security.

381
00:19:27,377 --> 00:19:28,381
Security?

382
00:19:29,118 --> 00:19:30,673
No,
you didn't see me.

383
00:19:33,118 --> 00:19:34,763
Let me ask you something.

384
00:19:35,324 --> 00:19:37,859
Those models, they get
paid pretty good, huh?

385
00:19:37,918 --> 00:19:40,161
Those models, yes.

386
00:19:40,372 --> 00:19:41,647
Why do you ask?

387
00:19:42,068 --> 00:19:44,171
Just seems like an easy
way to earn a buck.

388
00:19:44,241 --> 00:19:46,602
Just strut your stuff
and they pay you.

389
00:19:49,277 --> 00:19:52,321
And you're wondering if your
"stuff" is worth strutting.

390
00:19:53,684 --> 00:19:55,102
You're the pro here.

391
00:19:56,134 --> 00:19:57,860
So this is a consultation.

392
00:19:59,135 --> 00:20:00,454
I guess so.

393
00:20:00,524 --> 00:20:01,833
I charge for that.

394
00:20:05,318 --> 00:20:08,648
Let's say one margarita?

395
00:20:10,761 --> 00:20:12,002
I can do that.

396
00:20:14,989 --> 00:20:17,284
I'm going to buy
some cigarettes.

397
00:20:17,391 --> 00:20:18,873
I'll be right back.

398
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:36,791
May i help you?

399
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:40,601
Hi..

400
00:20:40,671 --> 00:20:43,569
This may seem
a little presumptuous but,

401
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,847
I met you
at demarco's show.

402
00:20:45,929 --> 00:20:47,625
- My name's...
- I know...

403
00:20:47,683 --> 00:20:48,933
Jane vasco.

404
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:51,294
I'm in the penthouse.

405
00:21:01,555 --> 00:21:03,215
After the other night...

406
00:21:03,752 --> 00:21:06,159
I'm just not sure if
i'm cut out for this.

407
00:21:06,323 --> 00:21:07,316
Thank you.

408
00:21:08,528 --> 00:21:11,356
You have all the credentials,
you'll get over it.

409
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:12,817
Opening night jitters.

410
00:21:12,879 --> 00:21:15,177
Hell,
i'm still jittering.

411
00:21:15,294 --> 00:21:17,993
It doesn't seem to
affect you at all.

412
00:21:18,063 --> 00:21:19,067
It did.

413
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:20,693
Like anything else,

414
00:21:20,755 --> 00:21:21,915
you do something
long enough,

415
00:21:23,005 --> 00:21:24,005
you get used to it.

416
00:21:24,661 --> 00:21:28,097
I guess i'm still wondering
if i want to.

417
00:21:33,255 --> 00:21:35,966
I felt like i was
in a shark tank.

418
00:21:36,756 --> 00:21:38,268
Is it always like that?

419
00:21:38,318 --> 00:21:39,799
Goes with the territory.

420
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:42,707
These particular type of
"shark" has a short life span.

421
00:21:42,758 --> 00:21:44,951
The "fins" only
hold up so long.

422
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,966
In all that
feeding frenzy,

423
00:21:48,138 --> 00:21:50,361
how do you find
your friends?

424
00:21:50,522 --> 00:21:55,044
Often in the most unlikely,
unexpected places.

425
00:21:56,517 --> 00:21:58,994
As long as they don't
let them smell blood.

426
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,039
Exactly.

427
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:08,037
That is a lot to think about.

428
00:22:11,245 --> 00:22:14,652
Just out of curiosity,
how'd you know my name?

429
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,581
How'd you know my address?

430
00:22:17,975 --> 00:22:19,479
People have a way of
finding each other...

431
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:20,914
When they need to.

432
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,590
Cheers.

433
00:22:41,654 --> 00:22:45,119
Dna results on geoffrey
and arlene were negative.

434
00:22:45,399 --> 00:22:47,701
And guys i think you'd better
take a look at this.

435
00:22:48,776 --> 00:22:51,756
Wanda norton's real
name is phyllis carson.

436
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:54,057
Born in erie, pennsylvania.

437
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:55,892
Got a lot of mileage
out of being pretty.

438
00:22:55,964 --> 00:22:58,170
Junior and senior
prom queen.

439
00:22:58,216 --> 00:23:02,085
Won the miss 'battle of lake
erie' beauty contest, twice.

440
00:23:02,155 --> 00:23:05,601
Other than that did some local
modeling et cetera, et cetera.

441
00:23:07,403 --> 00:23:11,166
Ts is phyllis on
the hood of a 1978 trans am.

442
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:13,262
What's your point,
she models classic cars.

443
00:23:13,352 --> 00:23:15,187
Today, it would
be classic.

444
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,505
When this photo was taken
the car was brand new.

445
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:22,081
This photo was
taken september 1977.

446
00:23:26,585 --> 00:23:31,107
Wanda... Phyllis...
was born in 1955.

447
00:23:31,212 --> 00:23:32,872
Puts her in her 50's.

448
00:23:33,153 --> 00:23:34,392
Has jane checked in yet?

449
00:23:34,464 --> 00:23:35,467
No.

450
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,416
Can't get her on
the comm, either.

451
00:23:37,465 --> 00:23:38,417
You try wanda's place?

452
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:39,669
It just rang.

453
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,069
Keep trying jane's comm.

454
00:23:42,173 --> 00:23:43,488
You and i'll check
her apartment.

455
00:23:43,668 --> 00:23:45,148
I want to know if
you hear something.

456
00:23:45,293 --> 00:23:46,293
Anything.

457
00:23:47,543 --> 00:23:50,458
I don't think the insecurity
ever really goes away.

458
00:23:50,542 --> 00:23:51,542
How can it?

459
00:23:52,232 --> 00:23:54,662
As models we spend
our entire careers

460
00:23:54,732 --> 00:23:56,941
watching the hourglas
slowly empty,

461
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,997
pretending it isn't,

462
00:23:59,792 --> 00:24:00,937
but, it is...

463
00:24:02,898 --> 00:24:04,253
It's getting late..

464
00:24:04,323 --> 00:24:05,585
I should... Go.

465
00:24:06,601 --> 00:24:07,601
No.

466
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:09,033
You belong here...

467
00:24:09,138 --> 00:24:09,991
With me.

468
00:24:12,837 --> 00:24:14,270
You see.

469
00:24:14,338 --> 00:24:16,993
Models are like roses:

470
00:24:17,899 --> 00:24:20,054
first we're delicate buds,

471
00:24:20,776 --> 00:24:23,198
then we're beautiful flowers.

472
00:24:24,086 --> 00:24:27,501
Then our petals slowly
fall and we die.

473
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,475
But you're different...

474
00:24:29,573 --> 00:24:31,135
Somehow you're special too.

475
00:24:32,699 --> 00:24:33,701
You...

476
00:24:35,411 --> 00:24:37,224
...are a beautiful flower

477
00:24:39,322 --> 00:24:41,921
that doesn't die.

478
00:24:48,928 --> 00:24:50,242
jane, open up!!!!

479
00:24:56,149 --> 00:24:57,235
Clear!!!!

480
00:25:04,755 --> 00:25:06,742
There's no way
that's vasco.

481
00:25:48,663 --> 00:25:50,117
You found me so easily.

482
00:25:50,197 --> 00:25:50,890
Where are we?

483
00:25:50,948 --> 00:25:52,554
Where have you taken me?

484
00:25:53,323 --> 00:25:54,806
That makes me uncomfortable.

485
00:25:54,883 --> 00:25:56,388
I thought it best to relocate

486
00:25:56,446 --> 00:25:58,848
to someplace we might
have more privacy.

487
00:25:59,888 --> 00:26:01,879
I've been watching you,

488
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,397
studying your face
for hours.

489
00:26:04,951 --> 00:26:06,753
You have
a timeless beauty.

490
00:26:07,215 --> 00:26:08,924
Raphael would have loved
painting you.

491
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:10,073
What do you
want from me?

492
00:26:10,183 --> 00:26:10,991
Youth.

493
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:12,756
You have it.

494
00:26:12,802 --> 00:26:13,865
I need it.

495
00:26:13,992 --> 00:26:14,572
Those girls...

496
00:26:14,638 --> 00:26:15,573
The ones that died...

497
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:17,988
Beauty comes with a price.

498
00:26:20,699 --> 00:26:22,446
Those girls didn't suffer.

499
00:26:23,011 --> 00:26:24,887
A small kiss is
all it takes.

500
00:26:36,008 --> 00:26:37,602
And then there's you.

501
00:26:38,133 --> 00:26:40,328
Someone who can give me
what i need without...

502
00:26:40,386 --> 00:26:42,141
Apparently paying
the price.

503
00:26:42,885 --> 00:26:45,758
An endless drink from
my fountain of youth.

504
00:26:51,602 --> 00:26:54,062
Alright people,
i need some answers!!!

505
00:26:54,201 --> 00:26:56,477
Bowers and i went over
every inch of wanda's condo.

506
00:26:56,524 --> 00:26:59,330
We found jane's prints on
a glass, but that's about it.

507
00:26:59,403 --> 00:27:00,855
No clue where they went.

508
00:27:00,901 --> 00:27:02,021
What about the girl
in jane's place?

509
00:27:02,091 --> 00:27:02,691
Amanda worth.

510
00:27:02,772 --> 00:27:03,719
She was jane's neighbour.

511
00:27:03,777 --> 00:27:05,898
She must've been in the wrong
place at the wrong time

512
00:27:05,965 --> 00:27:07,338
when wanda came in,
looking for jane.

513
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:08,339
Riley, anything?

514
00:27:08,404 --> 00:27:11,025
Ask me to track down
a serial killing neuro, a pyro,

515
00:27:11,083 --> 00:27:13,577
a minor and i'm good, but
damn, these frickin models

516
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:15,160
live out
of their purses.

517
00:27:15,213 --> 00:27:15,937
Harder to track than a...

518
00:27:15,983 --> 00:27:16,907
Find her!

519
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,345
A celebration's in order.

520
00:27:24,714 --> 00:27:27,252
You've taken ten years
off my face

521
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,447
and you've saved
someone's life.

522
00:27:29,897 --> 00:27:32,380
Think i'll get nominated
for a nobel?

523
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,997
To you, jane...

524
00:27:45,152 --> 00:27:48,260
You can't appreciate how amazing
it feels to be young

525
00:27:49,276 --> 00:27:51,309
because you've
never been old.

526
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:53,977
You know what they say
"skin deep" and all.

527
00:27:54,543 --> 00:27:57,927
What's beneath your skin
is already old and dead.

528
00:27:59,554 --> 00:28:01,760
Young and quick to judge.

529
00:28:02,037 --> 00:28:05,617
Do you know how you'd react
if you were in my shoes?

530
00:28:05,952 --> 00:28:08,193
The first time
it happened...

531
00:28:08,747 --> 00:28:11,253
When i realized what
i was capable of..

532
00:28:12,105 --> 00:28:13,782
It was an accident.

533
00:28:14,419 --> 00:28:15,665
I didn't understand it.

534
00:28:15,804 --> 00:28:16,878
It terrified me.

535
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,171
It made me sick.

536
00:28:18,287 --> 00:28:19,707
But you got over it.

537
00:28:20,308 --> 00:28:23,468
I swore it would be the last
time, never happen again. But..

538
00:28:27,447 --> 00:28:30,981
I suppose vanity
triumphed over...

539
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,239
Self-control.

540
00:28:34,358 --> 00:28:38,390
So, i did it again, for
the last time, i told myself.

541
00:28:38,448 --> 00:28:39,245
And every time
after that...

542
00:28:39,374 --> 00:28:41,486
It was always going
to be the last.

543
00:28:42,751 --> 00:28:45,101
I suppose it's the same
as anyone's addiction.

544
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,019
One last time at a time..

545
00:28:47,746 --> 00:28:49,606
Every "addiction"
has its price.

546
00:28:49,626 --> 00:28:50,922
As just mine.

547
00:28:51,049 --> 00:28:56,191
It seems that, along
with youth and beauty,

548
00:28:56,249 --> 00:29:01,885
the girls also leave a little bit
of themselves inside of me.

549
00:29:01,975 --> 00:29:04,620
Sometimes it's
little quirks.

550
00:29:04,758 --> 00:29:07,415
Shannon loved
these candies.

551
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:12,406
Lose the candy on
the runway, shannon.

552
00:29:13,261 --> 00:29:14,261
Amanda?

553
00:29:18,049 --> 00:29:21,029
You killed amanda?

554
00:29:21,945 --> 00:29:23,327
...She smoked.

555
00:29:23,385 --> 00:29:24,748
I've never smoked
in my life.

556
00:29:24,817 --> 00:29:26,295
Now i dream about it.

557
00:29:27,011 --> 00:29:28,010
But why?

558
00:29:29,021 --> 00:29:30,197
Why amanda?

559
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,541
I was looking for you.

560
00:29:32,633 --> 00:29:34,008
I found her.

561
00:29:34,077 --> 00:29:35,072
You're not an addict.

562
00:29:35,371 --> 00:29:36,641
You're a monster.

563
00:29:38,062 --> 00:29:39,563
No, darling.

564
00:29:40,394 --> 00:29:41,560
I'm a model.

565
00:29:47,901 --> 00:29:49,368
You've cut yourself.

566
00:29:51,485 --> 00:29:52,525
It'll heal.

567
00:29:55,235 --> 00:29:56,637
You're scared.

568
00:29:57,111 --> 00:29:58,381
Suspicious.

569
00:30:00,737 --> 00:30:04,071
But, i can make this
arrangement very nice for you.

570
00:30:04,174 --> 00:30:08,495
Clothes, money, jewelry...

571
00:30:09,188 --> 00:30:10,643
Anything you want...

572
00:30:12,611 --> 00:30:13,882
Like i said,

573
00:30:15,533 --> 00:30:18,224
in time you can get used
to the things you want,

574
00:30:18,825 --> 00:30:21,089
excuse the ways
in which you get them.

575
00:30:23,227 --> 00:30:24,186
Alright.

576
00:30:25,687 --> 00:30:26,658
Uncuff me

577
00:30:27,882 --> 00:30:30,319
and let me show you
what i can give you.

578
00:30:32,189 --> 00:30:33,506
I'd like that...

579
00:30:40,637 --> 00:30:41,769
But, not yet.

580
00:30:43,004 --> 00:30:46,171
Anticipation
heightens sensation..

581
00:30:59,307 --> 00:31:01,143
I'm pulling data on every
designer and agency

582
00:31:01,201 --> 00:31:03,222
wanda's worked for, every
model she's worked with,

583
00:31:03,326 --> 00:31:05,926
family, friends,
lovers, everyone.

584
00:31:06,076 --> 00:31:06,965
It's going to take awhile.

585
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,640
A while is too
long, riley.

586
00:31:08,686 --> 00:31:09,021
I know.

587
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:09,806
Boss.

588
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:13,121
Get back on it.

589
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:16,937
Tracing all those contacts
could takes days.

590
00:31:16,998 --> 00:31:19,235
I'm open to ideas.

591
00:31:19,309 --> 00:31:21,069
Arlene, the woman who
coordinates the shows,

592
00:31:21,453 --> 00:31:23,659
she said the models
spill their guts to her

593
00:31:23,728 --> 00:31:25,616
the good,
the bad, the ugly.

594
00:31:25,732 --> 00:31:27,233
Maybe wanda did, too.

595
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,293
Good.

596
00:31:28,642 --> 00:31:29,418
Go.

597
00:31:44,867 --> 00:31:46,472
I know how hard
this is for you.

598
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:49,498
What's hard, is i can take six
bullets and live,

599
00:31:49,544 --> 00:31:51,508
and why a bruise
won't go away.

600
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,303
We know what goes on in our
brains can affect our bodies.

601
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:58,003
But i've never done anything
to make it happen.

602
00:31:58,115 --> 00:32:01,649
You haven't but perhaps
your mind has.

603
00:33:33,382 --> 00:33:35,461
You don't know me, Jane
but this really

604
00:33:35,542 --> 00:33:36,547
is for the best...

605
00:33:36,616 --> 00:33:39,584
For me, for girls who would
otherwise have to die...

606
00:33:40,173 --> 00:33:42,963
When you think about it,
we have so much in common.

607
00:33:43,358 --> 00:33:45,931
Both of us alone, putting
on a front to show

608
00:33:46,012 --> 00:33:48,414
the rest of the world that
it doesn't touch us.

609
00:33:48,482 --> 00:33:52,376
Despite the pain inside,
we're just fine.

610
00:33:53,046 --> 00:33:55,350
But we both know
better, don't we?

611
00:33:56,294 --> 00:33:57,729
It does touch us.

612
00:33:58,421 --> 00:33:59,416
Deeply.

613
00:34:00,397 --> 00:34:01,749
And profoundly.

614
00:34:21,108 --> 00:34:25,716
And maybe true peace of
mind can only come

615
00:34:26,671 --> 00:34:28,503
when we can touch
each other.

616
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:36,924
Wanda is different than
the other girls

617
00:34:37,085 --> 00:34:39,029
She doesn't come to
me as much as they do.

618
00:34:39,947 --> 00:34:42,560
Most of these kids
are scared, lonely.

619
00:34:42,635 --> 00:34:44,512
They need someone
to talk to.

620
00:34:44,692 --> 00:34:45,633
Not wanda.

621
00:34:45,882 --> 00:34:46,632
Close friends?

622
00:34:46,713 --> 00:34:47,633
Lovers?

623
00:34:47,822 --> 00:34:49,716
I don't think she
has close friends.

624
00:34:49,866 --> 00:34:51,133
And i know she doesn't
hook up with any of

625
00:34:51,206 --> 00:34:52,569
the boy toy models.

626
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:55,101
She has dated one man,

627
00:34:55,194 --> 00:34:58,000
some high tech mucky muck.

628
00:34:58,071 --> 00:34:59,790
Keeps a penthouse in town.

629
00:35:00,135 --> 00:35:01,292
When he'd fly in
on business,

630
00:35:01,384 --> 00:35:02,382
they'd be inseparable.

631
00:35:02,805 --> 00:35:03,844
Got a name?

632
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:06,198
Jim blenheim.

633
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,319
I met him once.

634
00:35:07,388 --> 00:35:10,633
Good looking but thirty
years older than wanda.

635
00:35:10,714 --> 00:35:12,643
Never understood
the attraction.

636
00:35:12,701 --> 00:35:13,821
For her?

637
00:35:13,913 --> 00:35:14,595
For him.

638
00:35:14,641 --> 00:35:17,634
I can think of at
least thirty reasons.

639
00:35:17,692 --> 00:35:19,007
You know where
blenheim's place is?

640
00:35:19,043 --> 00:35:20,071
No.

641
00:35:20,129 --> 00:35:21,653
Blenheim was very private.

642
00:35:21,711 --> 00:35:23,651
I like to know where
my models are 24/7,

643
00:35:23,732 --> 00:35:25,361
but when wanda
was with him,

644
00:35:25,418 --> 00:35:26,228
it was like she'd
dropped off

645
00:35:26,295 --> 00:35:27,842
the face of the earth.

646
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:32,843
I just got off the phone
with liz logan,

647
00:35:32,913 --> 00:35:34,541
the new head of the taa.

648
00:35:34,645 --> 00:35:36,135
She's building
a new dynasty

649
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:38,176
and she's dying to work
with me!

650
00:35:38,222 --> 00:35:41,283
If it hadn't been for you,
this couldn't have happened...

651
00:35:51,102 --> 00:35:52,765
What have you
got on blenheim?

652
00:35:52,793 --> 00:35:54,094
The guy's got
a lot of money.

653
00:35:54,175 --> 00:35:55,942
And that buys
good privacy.

654
00:35:56,479 --> 00:35:57,790
I did get a hit.

655
00:35:58,418 --> 00:36:01,716
Architectural digest did
a spread on blenheim's 'palace'

656
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:03,403
the place
he has downtown.

657
00:36:04,153 --> 00:36:05,597
No mention of
where it is,

658
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:08,785
but i grabbed some background
detail through a window...

659
00:36:09,853 --> 00:36:11,759
That's the cronkite
building in the background.

660
00:36:11,828 --> 00:36:14,278
That window's just
south of the building.

661
00:36:14,889 --> 00:36:16,806
Given the angle we're
looking down from,

662
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:20,121
i calculate we're
460 feet in the air.

663
00:36:20,202 --> 00:36:22,370
The ceilings in that
room are ten feet.

664
00:36:22,451 --> 00:36:23,802
Assuming two feet
for structural...

665
00:36:23,883 --> 00:36:26,100
Riley, just give me a damn
address !

666
00:36:30,884 --> 00:36:33,439
231 west 71st.

667
00:36:33,634 --> 00:36:34,629
Penthouse.

668
00:36:37,678 --> 00:36:40,034
You asked me how it
feels to get old,

669
00:36:41,647 --> 00:36:47,202
to see everything that makes
life worth living slipping away.

670
00:36:49,511 --> 00:36:50,875
Now you know.

671
00:36:53,388 --> 00:36:56,477
I should've known it was
too good to be true.

672
00:36:57,511 --> 00:37:00,288
There's always a price
that has to be paid.

673
00:37:00,574 --> 00:37:01,825
Always..

674
00:37:04,274 --> 00:37:06,214
I wish i didn't
have to pay it.

675
00:37:07,189 --> 00:37:08,847
I wish i didn't need it...

676
00:37:09,188 --> 00:37:13,047
...And, sadly, you
can no longer help me.

677
00:37:30,046 --> 00:37:32,010
I like you, jane,
i really do.

678
00:37:32,379 --> 00:37:36,121
I'm sorry things have
to end this way,

679
00:37:36,329 --> 00:37:39,609
but i know you understand why
i have to do what i'm doing...

680
00:37:39,689 --> 00:37:41,364
You're useless to me now,

681
00:37:41,895 --> 00:37:44,933
like a dress that's gone
terribly out of style.

682
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:47,670
I'm going to have
to replace you...

683
00:37:48,752 --> 00:37:50,176
I don't go out of style.

684
00:37:50,315 --> 00:37:52,100
I'm timeless... Remember?

685
00:38:06,253 --> 00:38:07,253
You all right?

686
00:38:07,937 --> 00:38:08,937
Feeling my age.

687
00:38:12,816 --> 00:38:13,809
Chip her.

688
00:38:23,596 --> 00:38:24,879
It'd be fascinating
to understand

689
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,513
the neurological mechanism
at work here...

690
00:38:40,809 --> 00:38:42,330
Some kind of seizure.

691
00:38:44,749 --> 00:38:45,789
Andre here.

692
00:38:46,935 --> 00:38:47,935
I got her.

693
00:38:53,919 --> 00:38:54,797
Hurry!!

694
00:38:59,696 --> 00:39:00,909
Grab the legs!!

695
00:39:12,181 --> 00:39:13,048
Seth, what's happening?

696
00:39:13,106 --> 00:39:14,053
I don't know.

697
00:39:16,868 --> 00:39:17,739
I do...

698
00:39:17,831 --> 00:39:19,552
She's experiencing
my life...

699
00:39:19,621 --> 00:39:21,157
Every bullet, every cut...

700
00:39:21,238 --> 00:39:23,225
Everything
i could heal from.

701
00:39:38,617 --> 00:39:40,525
I know how it feels,
i know.

702
00:39:41,932 --> 00:39:42,928
It's okay.

703
00:39:49,242 --> 00:39:50,242
She's gone.

704
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:09,176
You let yourself get old.

705
00:40:10,569 --> 00:40:12,641
I didn't 'let'
myself get old.

706
00:40:13,256 --> 00:40:14,604
I made it happen.

707
00:40:16,695 --> 00:40:17,470
How?

708
00:40:18,256 --> 00:40:21,039
Let's cut
the cat-and-mouse, seth.

709
00:40:21,133 --> 00:40:22,725
I know what you're
looking for.

710
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,624
And i know you know
more than i know.

711
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:28,727
So i'm kind of
curious here.

712
00:40:30,668 --> 00:40:31,776
Am i a neuro?

713
00:40:33,085 --> 00:40:35,981
The whole science of
neurological aberration

714
00:40:36,038 --> 00:40:37,084
is new field, jane...

715
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:39,446
Remember the bruise i
had that wouldn't heal?

716
00:40:39,642 --> 00:40:40,405
Of course.

717
00:40:40,474 --> 00:40:42,322
You wondered if
i wasn't healing

718
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,846
because of how
i was feeling.

719
00:40:43,904 --> 00:40:44,398
Mentally.

720
00:40:44,459 --> 00:40:45,399
Emotionally.

721
00:40:45,567 --> 00:40:47,877
Before that, i'd always assumed
the healing just happened,

722
00:40:47,958 --> 00:40:49,913
that i was like
a salamander that regrows

723
00:40:50,024 --> 00:40:52,039
his tail after
it's cut off.

724
00:40:52,085 --> 00:40:53,126
He doesn't make it happen.

725
00:40:53,229 --> 00:40:53,979
It just... Does.

726
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,086
Yes...

727
00:40:55,204 --> 00:40:57,248
Every neuro we've encountered
has had mental control

728
00:40:57,294 --> 00:40:58,010
over what they did.

729
00:40:58,103 --> 00:40:59,131
Exactly my point.

730
00:40:59,535 --> 00:41:02,355
If my brain
controls my healing,

731
00:41:02,409 --> 00:41:04,155
then i should be able
to turn the healing off.

732
00:41:04,215 --> 00:41:05,156
Theoretically.

733
00:41:05,231 --> 00:41:07,703
I decided to check the theory
and take my brain

734
00:41:07,782 --> 00:41:09,470
for a test drive.

735
00:41:10,186 --> 00:41:11,252
Meaning?

736
00:41:11,321 --> 00:41:13,146
When i was with
wanda, i cut my hand.

737
00:41:13,319 --> 00:41:17,165
It started to heal,
but i made the healing stop...

738
00:41:17,223 --> 00:41:19,799
I let the pain of what
had happened to amanda...

739
00:41:19,833 --> 00:41:21,439
Take hold of my emotions.

740
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,452
The same thing happened
with wanda.

741
00:41:23,533 --> 00:41:25,831
I made the healing stop.

742
00:41:25,909 --> 00:41:27,549
We don't know that's
what happened, jane.

743
00:41:28,031 --> 00:41:28,971
Not for sure.

744
00:41:29,042 --> 00:41:30,983
It's my brain and my body.

745
00:41:31,033 --> 00:41:32,693
I know what's going
on inside of me.

746
00:41:32,774 --> 00:41:34,598
So do i, and neither
of us should jump

747
00:41:34,656 --> 00:41:35,419
to any conclusions.

748
00:41:35,476 --> 00:41:36,405
Not yet.

749
00:41:36,481 --> 00:41:39,091
You jump whenever
it feels right.

750
00:41:39,847 --> 00:41:41,243
I already have.

751
00:41:50,533 --> 00:41:53,874
A part of me felt sad
for phyllis carson,

752
00:41:53,908 --> 00:41:55,376
of erie, pennsylvania.

753
00:41:56,346 --> 00:42:00,273
An innocent little girl
learned that being 'pretty'

754
00:42:00,342 --> 00:42:02,165
made the world
go around.

755
00:42:02,407 --> 00:42:06,034
It made life worth living
for her, and for wanda..

756
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:07,374
At any cost.

757
00:42:08,408 --> 00:42:11,739
Maybe wanda has been
released from an evil curse

758
00:42:11,849 --> 00:42:13,290
and is finally free.

759
00:42:14,192 --> 00:42:17,356
Maybe somewhere phyllis
carson is still a pretty

760
00:42:17,402 --> 00:42:18,233
little girl...

761
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:20,358
And that's enough.

762
00:42:21,191 --> 00:42:24,426
And maybe amanda has
finally found the home

763
00:42:24,505 --> 00:42:25,731
she never had..

764
00:42:27,221 --> 00:42:28,907
I want to believe she has.

765
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:32,566
Then again, i'm the girl
who once believed

766
00:42:32,627 --> 00:42:33,886
in fairy tales.

767
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:38,067
And maybe that's
not so bad.

768
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:43,192
In the end, the slipper
fit cinderella's foot,

769
00:42:45,097 --> 00:42:46,183
didn't it?

770
00:42:47,384 --> 00:42:49,896
