1
00:00:00,811 --> 00:00:02,186
My name is Jane Vasco.

2
00:00:02,268 --> 00:00:03,632
I could use you on my team.

3
00:00:03,714 --> 00:00:07,146
I work for a secret government
agency that hunts neuros.

4
00:00:07,191 --> 00:00:11,095
People who can do dangerous
things with their minds.

5
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:12,837
On my first assignment...

6
00:00:12,884 --> 00:00:18,291
Something a little weird happened,
okay, something really weird.

7
00:00:18,611 --> 00:00:23,286
Until I get some answers i'm getting on
with my life, doing my job.

8
00:00:23,483 --> 00:00:28,538
Stocking up on aspirin,
because let me tell ya,

9
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:29,890
pain's a bitch!

10
00:00:30,713 --> 00:00:33,125
And we're very pleased to
announce that the rent committee

11
00:00:33,184 --> 00:00:35,346
has raised another $1,500

12
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,308
toward the community
center swimming pool.

13
00:00:38,355 --> 00:00:40,107
Plans for the charity
picnic next sunday

14
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:44,692
are well underway and we are
expecting a significant turn out.

15
00:00:44,728 --> 00:00:46,561
Sheriff Farber, I think
you have a few words.

16
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,866
Thanks mayor.

17
00:00:47,925 --> 00:00:49,049
Hey folks.

18
00:00:49,123 --> 00:00:51,236
We've noticed an increase
in parking violations,

19
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,422
especially in front
of miller's pharmacy.

20
00:00:53,493 --> 00:00:55,787
Now we know most of you
are just runnin' in to

21
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:58,646
pick up a last minute item
but we do have a hydrant

22
00:00:58,681 --> 00:01:00,138
there and we need
to keep it clear.

23
00:01:00,161 --> 00:01:01,394
Just in case.

24
00:01:01,452 --> 00:01:03,474
We appreciate
your cooperation.

25
00:01:03,862 --> 00:01:04,859
Thank you, sheriff.

26
00:01:05,307 --> 00:01:08,739
So the next meeting will be
next thursday at 3:00.

27
00:01:08,798 --> 00:01:09,703
We'll see you then.

28
00:01:14,372 --> 00:01:17,581
Ever wonder how to restore those
stained pots and pans

29
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:20,050
i'm going to
show you some simple techniques,

30
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,791
simply by using things
you have...

31
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:24,694
I'm surprised to get a visit from
the fbi, agent Kearny,

32
00:01:24,741 --> 00:01:27,577
but it's very upsetting to
have susan leave town the way

33
00:01:27,624 --> 00:01:29,387
she did without
a word to anyone.

34
00:01:30,297 --> 00:01:32,031
That's not like
her at all.

35
00:01:32,925 --> 00:01:34,445
And you haven't
heard from her.

36
00:01:34,486 --> 00:01:35,686
Not since last saturday.

37
00:01:36,175 --> 00:01:37,571
When she left town.

38
00:01:38,488 --> 00:01:39,993
Tollhouse cookies.

39
00:01:40,298 --> 00:01:42,144
Have to keep
an eye on them.

40
00:01:42,238 --> 00:01:43,721
And you have no idea
why she left

41
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,046
or where she may
have gone.

42
00:01:45,085 --> 00:01:46,047
No.

43
00:01:46,354 --> 00:01:48,446
I was as surprised
as anyone else.

44
00:01:48,611 --> 00:01:49,763
But you're
not worried.

45
00:01:50,526 --> 00:01:51,467
Worried?

46
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,030
About susan?

47
00:01:53,706 --> 00:01:54,706
Oh, my gosh, no.

48
00:01:55,828 --> 00:01:56,828
Should i be?

49
00:01:57,954 --> 00:02:00,793
I mean did something
happen to her?

50
00:02:04,138 --> 00:02:05,196
Mrs. Meyers.

51
00:02:06,077 --> 00:02:08,628
I have records here
indicating that susan shaw

52
00:02:08,687 --> 00:02:13,353
called your house at least six times
after she left fair oaks.

53
00:02:14,211 --> 00:02:15,206
Really?

54
00:02:15,604 --> 00:02:16,826
Well that's odd,
isn't it?

55
00:02:16,897 --> 00:02:18,401
You didn't take
those phone calls?

56
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,258
No,
not that i rember.

57
00:02:20,329 --> 00:02:25,136
There's also one here made from
your house to susan's cell phone.

58
00:02:25,206 --> 00:02:26,864
I'm sure it's nothing.

59
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:29,896
Probably one of those
phone company mix-ups.

60
00:02:30,263 --> 00:02:32,079
I'm afraid, mrs. Meyers,
that i don't believe

61
00:02:32,165 --> 00:02:34,433
you're being completely
honest with me.

62
00:02:34,857 --> 00:02:36,102
If i have to...

63
00:02:36,761 --> 00:02:38,917
I can take you in
for questioning.

64
00:02:39,211 --> 00:02:40,208
Goodness.

65
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,382
I really think you should
check with the phone company.

66
00:03:02,032 --> 00:03:03,842
Oh, cookies.

67
00:03:09,421 --> 00:03:15,098
Transcript : swsub.com
Synchro : IceFre@k

68
00:03:21,149 --> 00:03:25,900
It wasn't too long ago
that "meals-for-one"
were a staple in my kitchen.

69
00:03:26,027 --> 00:03:30,233
It wasn't too long ago that no one
was stealing the blankets.

70
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,099
Until a few months ago,

71
00:03:32,156 --> 00:03:33,589
i had nothing to do
after dinner

72
00:03:33,648 --> 00:03:37,456
but clean up, read
a book and go to bed.

73
00:03:37,907 --> 00:03:40,832
I didn't have to fight for mirror space
to get ready for work.

74
00:03:40,902 --> 00:03:43,503
I never reached for
the wrong toothbrush.

75
00:03:44,277 --> 00:03:46,329
There was never a wet
towel on the floor,

76
00:03:46,381 --> 00:03:48,908
socks or underwear
to pick up.

77
00:03:49,297 --> 00:03:51,320
But for all of that,

78
00:03:51,401 --> 00:03:53,911
brian has made this
now-crowded shower

79
00:03:53,981 --> 00:03:57,542
of mine the best way i can think of
to start my day.

80
00:03:58,403 --> 00:03:59,602
Besides...

81
00:03:59,653 --> 00:04:01,102
"Meals-for-one" suck.

82
00:04:07,854 --> 00:04:09,993
I really have to get
to work!

83
00:04:10,062 --> 00:04:12,154
You want to get there
clean, don't you?

84
00:04:12,492 --> 00:04:13,359
I see.

85
00:04:13,405 --> 00:04:14,514
You're just
trying to help.

86
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,515
Of course.

87
00:04:15,752 --> 00:04:17,394
Doesn't this help?

88
00:04:17,452 --> 00:04:18,943
- Oh yeah it helps !
- Yeah ?

89
00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:21,243
But i'm not gonna get
to work on time.

90
00:04:21,685 --> 00:04:23,315
Oh well I can stop now.

91
00:04:24,471 --> 00:04:26,806
Not now you can't!

92
00:04:27,014 --> 00:04:28,055
Too late.

93
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,767
You're going to be
in trouble.

94
00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:33,188
I like getting
in trouble.

95
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:37,916
Fair oaks.

96
00:04:38,401 --> 00:04:39,916
Population 3,600.

97
00:04:39,985 --> 00:04:42,292
Six schools,
twelve churches.

98
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,997
Juvenile delinquency, zero.

99
00:04:45,078 --> 00:04:48,176
Drugs and alcohol
problems, zero.

100
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:51,240
Crime rate, zero.

101
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,827
Sounds like a travelogue.

102
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:53,892
Sounds like a lie.

103
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:54,950
Have some faith.

104
00:04:55,025 --> 00:04:55,770
I do.

105
00:04:55,822 --> 00:04:56,765
In what i know.

106
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:59,577
Over the last two years four of
the locals have gone missing.

107
00:04:59,672 --> 00:05:02,007
When interviewed,
no one in fair oaks

108
00:05:02,077 --> 00:05:03,825
seems to know anything
about anything.

109
00:05:03,874 --> 00:05:04,826
Riley.

110
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,630
Alan carmody left for work on a tuesday
morning and never got to work.

111
00:05:13,186 --> 00:05:14,792
Nobody's seen him since.

112
00:05:15,555 --> 00:05:18,179
Kevin loomis was due
home from a business trip

113
00:05:18,248 --> 00:05:21,459
eighteen months ago, but once again
he never showed up.

114
00:05:21,557 --> 00:05:24,239
Flight records indicate
that he was on the flight.

115
00:05:24,632 --> 00:05:25,811
Susan shaw.

116
00:05:25,869 --> 00:05:26,794
Housewife.

117
00:05:26,877 --> 00:05:29,624
Apparently, she liked to take regular
pilgrimages into the city...

118
00:05:29,698 --> 00:05:33,155
However on one excursions
she didn't come back home.

119
00:05:33,247 --> 00:05:35,802
Then there's this guy,
paul barnes.

120
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:37,796
He's been missing for two days

121
00:05:37,877 --> 00:05:39,206
I'm still working on it.

122
00:05:39,316 --> 00:05:40,766
Looks like
cynicism wins out.

123
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:44,328
Brains don't
i'm an optimist.

124
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:46,498
I know people are dirt and
they never let me down.

125
00:05:46,535 --> 00:05:49,552
Two days ago, the feds sent an agent
to conduct interviews.

126
00:05:49,645 --> 00:05:50,443
Riley...

127
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:52,443
Fbi agent shane kearny.

128
00:05:52,878 --> 00:05:53,814
Missing?

129
00:05:53,957 --> 00:05:54,743
You got it.

130
00:05:54,778 --> 00:05:56,154
Even with all this...

131
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:58,177
What about it
spells neuro?

132
00:05:58,246 --> 00:06:00,374
Transcripted interviews
from law enforcement.

133
00:06:00,473 --> 00:06:04,300
A lot of upstanding citizens from
fair oaks saying the same things.

134
00:06:04,369 --> 00:06:06,959
I saw nothing,
i know nothing.

135
00:06:07,005 --> 00:06:09,583
Everything about this fits
the neuro profile.

136
00:06:12,517 --> 00:06:14,216
And then there's this.

137
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:17,996
Pulled this up
off the net.

138
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,025
A kid named danny miller.

139
00:06:21,592 --> 00:06:24,197
He blogs just outside of fair oaks
at this internet cafe.

140
00:06:24,848 --> 00:06:26,279
"It's like that movie...

141
00:06:26,348 --> 00:06:28,948
"Everyone in this stupid
town seems like pod people.

142
00:06:29,216 --> 00:06:31,908
"My parents used to go at each other
"like world class wrestling.

143
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,095
"Since we moved to fair
oaks, it's all kisses,

144
00:06:34,141 --> 00:06:35,945
"smiles and do
your homework.

145
00:06:36,014 --> 00:06:39,101
"Trust me, the moment i can
get some cash together...

146
00:06:39,182 --> 00:06:41,806
"I am out of there."
that was his last one.

147
00:06:41,864 --> 00:06:43,783
He's bring a half a dozen
just like this.

148
00:06:43,841 --> 00:06:44,835
How old is he?

149
00:06:44,951 --> 00:06:45,913
15.

150
00:06:46,421 --> 00:06:48,930
Who doesn't feel
that way at 15 ?

151
00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:51,231
...My dad made it seem like
he never was a kid.

152
00:06:51,346 --> 00:06:53,584
I used to sneak out of
the house all the time.

153
00:06:53,658 --> 00:06:54,988
In your skivvies?

154
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,213
The point is,

155
00:06:56,271 --> 00:06:57,848
something ain't
right in fair oaks.

156
00:06:57,881 --> 00:07:01,095
I think it best if you interviewed
Danny Miller when he's out of town.

157
00:07:01,361 --> 00:07:02,660
According to riley
he hangs out

158
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:04,737
at the internet cafe
in the city.

159
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,874
This house just came on
the market in fair oaks.

160
00:07:09,065 --> 00:07:13,273
What do you say, maureen,
interested in buying a house.

161
00:07:13,377 --> 00:07:14,521
Wow, that's so sudden.

162
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,828
Don't you think you should
at least buy me dinner first?

163
00:07:16,868 --> 00:07:18,130
Let's roll, people.

164
00:07:22,181 --> 00:07:24,805
It's just perfect here in fair oaks,
it really is.

165
00:07:24,852 --> 00:07:27,779
As you can see, the
morning light is terrific,

166
00:07:28,126 --> 00:07:29,836
it's got plenty
of room to grow.

167
00:07:29,941 --> 00:07:31,828
And it's the right price.

168
00:07:32,383 --> 00:07:34,557
Well, It is very nice.

169
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:37,470
Howdy.

170
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,938
You folks looking to buy?

171
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,009
We're thinking about it.

172
00:07:43,067 --> 00:07:44,604
Whereabouts you from?

173
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,003
Glenville.

174
00:07:46,373 --> 00:07:47,968
Well that's a nice place.

175
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:49,668
What brings to fair oaks?

176
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:52,223
Just looking for
a little more room.

177
00:07:52,327 --> 00:07:53,319
I see.

178
00:07:53,842 --> 00:07:55,691
Well, this is a great
place to bring up kids.

179
00:07:55,738 --> 00:07:56,569
Good schools.

180
00:07:56,778 --> 00:07:58,038
No crime.

181
00:07:58,096 --> 00:08:00,986
Heck, i shot the last
person i caught littering.

182
00:08:03,526 --> 00:08:05,664
Well, good luck

183
00:08:05,757 --> 00:08:06,757
Thank you.

184
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:13,745
What do you think?

185
00:08:14,998 --> 00:08:16,131
I like it.

186
00:08:17,877 --> 00:08:18,559
Honey?

187
00:08:18,617 --> 00:08:20,490
I don't know,
seems a little small.

188
00:08:20,605 --> 00:08:22,258
All empty houses
seem small at first.

189
00:08:22,339 --> 00:08:26,145
Once you get them furnished,
it makes a world of difference.

190
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,497
I don't know.

191
00:08:27,544 --> 00:08:28,400
He doesn't know.

192
00:08:28,587 --> 00:08:31,012
If you'd like, we can
see the meyers house.

193
00:08:31,086 --> 00:08:32,684
They have a very
similar layout.

194
00:08:32,728 --> 00:08:35,942
It might help if you could see what
it looks like when it's more lived in.

195
00:08:36,023 --> 00:08:36,971
Why don't we?

196
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:38,844
They meyers, let's
go meet them.

197
00:08:39,405 --> 00:08:40,977
Right this way.

198
00:08:42,775 --> 00:08:45,771
You won't find a cleaner, safer,
more welcoming and friendly neighborhood

199
00:08:45,832 --> 00:08:46,972
than we have right here.

200
00:08:50,006 --> 00:08:50,526
Man...

201
00:08:50,699 --> 00:08:52,960
I can't believe you guys
were reading my blog.

202
00:08:53,034 --> 00:08:54,318
That's so cool.

203
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,954
This really gonna
be in a magazine?

204
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,271
That depends.

205
00:08:58,965 --> 00:09:02,168
We'd like to hear a little
bit more about fair oaks.

206
00:09:02,216 --> 00:09:05,025
You mean "zombieville."
scary place, huh?

207
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,100
Totally freaked out.

208
00:09:06,123 --> 00:09:08,169
It's like everyone there is
always trying to be so

209
00:09:08,204 --> 00:09:09,975
perfect and happy
all the time.

210
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,776
Only i don't think
that they are.

211
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:13,152
Your parents know
how you feel?

212
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:14,227
Yeah, they know.

213
00:09:14,297 --> 00:09:15,892
I'm like the town weirdo.

214
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,678
They won't even let me
watch any regular tv.

215
00:09:18,747 --> 00:09:19,603
What do you mean?

216
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,508
They've got this
stupid town channel.

217
00:09:21,572 --> 00:09:23,144
It's on like all day long.

218
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,843
You want to talk about
boring and weird.

219
00:09:24,947 --> 00:09:25,821
What do they show?

220
00:09:25,884 --> 00:09:26,696
Who knows.

221
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:28,878
I won't watch it.

222
00:09:30,207 --> 00:09:33,408
A lot of stupid people talking about
what's going on in town.

223
00:09:33,455 --> 00:09:36,894
Picnics and sack races and
a lot of other braindead crap.

224
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:37,951
You ever see that movie,

225
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,900
"invasion of the body snatchers?"
great flick.

226
00:09:40,969 --> 00:09:42,093
Yeah, great.

227
00:09:43,069 --> 00:09:44,937
Until you have
to live there.

228
00:09:50,572 --> 00:09:53,057
Jack and i
have never been happier.

229
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,658
It really is a wonderful place to live.

230
00:09:55,739 --> 00:09:56,999
Your house is lovely.

231
00:09:57,069 --> 00:09:58,239
Thank you for having us.

232
00:09:58,309 --> 00:09:59,072
Thank you.

233
00:09:59,127 --> 00:10:04,309
I'm still not sure about the blinds in
the kitchen, but oh, well...

234
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:06,251
What is it that you do, mr. Rhodes?

235
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,412
I work for the government.

236
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:08,667
He's an accountant.

237
00:10:08,736 --> 00:10:09,823
Oh, i see.

238
00:10:11,012 --> 00:10:12,277
Is there a restroom
i can use.

239
00:10:12,381 --> 00:10:13,861
Just down the hall,
to the left.

240
00:10:13,953 --> 00:10:14,783
Thank you.

241
00:10:14,829 --> 00:10:16,205
I was never very good with numbers.

242
00:10:16,228 --> 00:10:17,791
I leave all that to jack.

243
00:10:17,849 --> 00:10:22,827
This room over here is my favourite
room, this is the dining room.

244
00:10:23,504 --> 00:10:26,025
We entertain an
awful lot in here.

245
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:27,528
We have great big parties.

246
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,494
It looked like a hole
from a 9 millimeter,

247
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:31,872
guess they didn't have time to cover
their tracks.

248
00:10:31,953 --> 00:10:33,946
I ran a background check
on the meyers.

249
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:34,565
Clean.

250
00:10:34,612 --> 00:10:37,190
Or just "painted over"
like the rest of the town.

251
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:41,056
What's your read
on danny miller?

252
00:10:41,136 --> 00:10:42,035
He's a kid.

253
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:45,074
Like to get into some trouble but can't
seem to find any.

254
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:46,900
You ever meet
a happy teenager?

255
00:10:46,943 --> 00:10:48,550
The thing is, we're not going to be able

256
00:10:48,596 --> 00:10:50,386
to investigate this
from the outside.

257
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:57,098
All of a sudden i started to
have a bad feeling about this.

258
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:59,789
I knew exactly where
andre were going.

259
00:10:59,905 --> 00:11:02,497
He knew that he and maureen
were going to be rejected

260
00:11:02,587 --> 00:11:04,957
by the fair oaks
home owners committee,

261
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:07,801
he needed another couple
to buy the house.

262
00:11:12,298 --> 00:11:16,841
Mr. And mrs. Connor king,
that has a nice ring to it.

263
00:11:16,911 --> 00:11:18,090
Shoot me now.

264
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:20,505
Wouldn't do any good,
you'd just heal.

265
00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:24,191
Good luck kids.

266
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:25,959
Have fun.

267
00:11:27,401 --> 00:11:31,193
And also, remember to get those
bulbs and seeds planted early.

268
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:33,499
Judging from the greens and
garden centre will take place

269
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:34,846
the first week of june.

270
00:11:34,915 --> 00:11:38,096
So let's get those little green thumbs
out there busy.

271
00:11:38,443 --> 00:11:40,270
There are still openings
for the volunteer...

272
00:11:40,351 --> 00:11:41,611
I'll be in my room.

273
00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:42,651
Danny.

274
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:45,172
We hardly get to
see you anymore.

275
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:47,268
I got stuff to do, mom.

276
00:11:47,382 --> 00:11:49,579
Just come sit with
me for a moment.

277
00:11:49,856 --> 00:11:51,301
It won't kill you.

278
00:11:51,371 --> 00:11:53,232
Man, that stuff
is so boring.

279
00:11:53,926 --> 00:11:55,278
Five minutes.

280
00:11:55,417 --> 00:11:56,738
For your mom?

281
00:12:02,438 --> 00:12:05,027
I was starting to forget
what you look like.

282
00:12:05,108 --> 00:12:07,294
We're pleased to announce
that the teen rec center

283
00:12:07,376 --> 00:12:09,966
will re-open this
coming tuesday night.

284
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:12,798
There will be a free swim
period followed by

285
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:15,783
a spirited discussion
on "community spirit...

286
00:12:15,922 --> 00:12:16,789
How you can help."

287
00:12:16,847 --> 00:12:19,390
we'd like to thank
the hopkes, thompsons

288
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:23,656
and millers for their very generous
contribution to the new addition.

289
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:24,919
Thank you.

290
00:12:28,653 --> 00:12:30,225
Ever wonder how
to get stale,

291
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,537
unpleasant odors
out of the house?

292
00:12:32,606 --> 00:12:35,583
Well, here's a way to keep your
house smelling garden fresh

293
00:12:35,696 --> 00:12:38,530
without using
artificial chemicals.

294
00:12:42,948 --> 00:12:45,826
The town council gave
us the final thumbs up.

295
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,915
I guess it's home
sweet home.

296
00:12:48,022 --> 00:12:50,462
Do you want me to carry you across
the threshold?

297
00:12:50,627 --> 00:12:54,523
Trust me i crossed the threshold
when i took this assignment.

298
00:12:55,471 --> 00:12:58,154
Just so you know,
i sleep on the left.

299
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,076
No.

300
00:12:59,182 --> 00:13:00,691
You sleep in the den.

301
00:13:04,014 --> 00:13:06,194
I didn't know you
guys were moving in.

302
00:13:08,077 --> 00:13:10,327
Well, we didn't
find it as creepy as you did.

303
00:13:10,388 --> 00:13:11,388
Cool.

304
00:13:12,013 --> 00:13:14,683
Are you still putting my
story in your magazine?

305
00:13:14,822 --> 00:13:15,562
Just because...

306
00:13:15,631 --> 00:13:16,891
Something wrong?

307
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:21,821
Well, some of the stuff i said mighta
sounded kinda creepy.

308
00:13:22,018 --> 00:13:23,787
I was in a pretty
bad mood.

309
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:27,197
Well, it didn't sound as
if you were very happy here.

310
00:13:27,902 --> 00:13:28,586
I know.

311
00:13:28,677 --> 00:13:31,333
But now that i've gotten to know some of
the kids and stuff,

312
00:13:31,382 --> 00:13:33,743
it's not that bad,
really.

313
00:13:33,871 --> 00:13:35,142
You're liking it better.

314
00:13:35,454 --> 00:13:36,898
Actually, i like
it a whole lot.

315
00:13:36,957 --> 00:13:39,824
We've got a new rec center
with a pool and everything.

316
00:13:39,963 --> 00:13:41,801
It's really
pretty cool here.

317
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:43,870
You'll find out.

318
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,055
I'll see you at
the picnic on sunday.

319
00:13:48,149 --> 00:13:49,881
It's gonna be tons
of fun.

320
00:13:59,574 --> 00:14:02,395
I ran some background on
the missing persons.

321
00:14:02,569 --> 00:14:04,849
Kevin loomis was
a contractor.

322
00:14:04,976 --> 00:14:06,987
Seems he wanted to buy
a chunk of fair oaks

323
00:14:07,057 --> 00:14:08,964
in order to build low
income housing.

324
00:14:09,092 --> 00:14:10,837
Somehow i can't
see that.

325
00:14:12,398 --> 00:14:14,399
Apparently, susan shaw
made regular trips

326
00:14:14,491 --> 00:14:17,115
into the city to meet
a regular boyfriend.

327
00:14:17,242 --> 00:14:18,439
She was married,
wasn't she?

328
00:14:19,112 --> 00:14:20,694
Something else that
doesn't quite fit

329
00:14:20,756 --> 00:14:22,745
the fair oaks image of
a happy community.

330
00:14:22,814 --> 00:14:25,453
Something happened to turn
danny miller around.

331
00:14:25,487 --> 00:14:27,059
It was like talking to
a different kid.

332
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:27,945
The question is why.

333
00:14:28,008 --> 00:14:29,013
So what do we have here ?

334
00:14:29,059 --> 00:14:31,048
A neuro who wants
to keep things nice and...

335
00:14:31,129 --> 00:14:31,522
Tidy?

336
00:14:31,591 --> 00:14:33,522
And is willing to kill
to keep it that way.

337
00:14:33,603 --> 00:14:36,389
Fair oaks is a good
four square miles.

338
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:39,305
Hard for a neuro to maintain
proximity over that distance.

339
00:14:39,883 --> 00:14:41,628
I'm running satellite
surveillance,

340
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:44,096
sweeping the area for
everything i can think of.

341
00:14:44,195 --> 00:14:46,197
Water samples, air
samples, you name it.

342
00:14:46,567 --> 00:14:47,570
What's your call?

343
00:14:49,065 --> 00:14:50,660
We need more answers.

344
00:15:09,982 --> 00:15:11,115
You were there first.

345
00:15:11,173 --> 00:15:11,832
Are you sure?

346
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,335
It's the last piece.

347
00:15:13,566 --> 00:15:15,359
Yeah, yeah,
i'll take the gouda.

348
00:15:15,578 --> 00:15:17,328
Connor prefers it anyway.

349
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,592
You're the new people.

350
00:15:19,638 --> 00:15:20,170
Yes.

351
00:15:20,274 --> 00:15:21,573
Jane dawns.

352
00:15:21,761 --> 00:15:22,621
Jennifer meyers.

353
00:15:22,702 --> 00:15:23,719
Welcome to fair oaks.

354
00:15:23,765 --> 00:15:24,761
Thank you.

355
00:15:24,944 --> 00:15:27,437
I've been meaning to stop by
and personally welcome you.

356
00:15:28,015 --> 00:15:29,241
No problem.

357
00:15:29,323 --> 00:15:30,721
With all the moving in...

358
00:15:30,813 --> 00:15:32,374
It's been quite hectic.

359
00:15:32,455 --> 00:15:33,759
Well, when you feel
settled,

360
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:36,559
jack and i would love
to have you over for dinner.

361
00:15:36,744 --> 00:15:37,824
That would be very nice.

362
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:39,635
Thank you.

363
00:15:40,417 --> 00:15:42,613
Say, do you know
susan shaw?

364
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,572
Yes.

365
00:15:43,631 --> 00:15:45,157
How do you know susan?

366
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:48,382
Susan was a teacher
of mine back in college.

367
00:15:48,509 --> 00:15:50,012
We hadn't spoken
for awhile

368
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:53,319
but last i heard
she'd moved to fair oaks.

369
00:15:53,469 --> 00:15:56,891
Yes. Susan and paul moved to
fair oaks about two years ago.

370
00:15:58,382 --> 00:15:59,629
So is it...

371
00:16:00,819 --> 00:16:02,137
True what i heard?

372
00:16:02,947 --> 00:16:04,010
What's that?

373
00:16:04,823 --> 00:16:06,126
Well, you know...

374
00:16:07,663 --> 00:16:09,819
...That susan ran
off with another man.

375
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:10,891
Susan?

376
00:16:11,573 --> 00:16:14,035
No, i don't know
anything about that.

377
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,405
And i don't believe it.

378
00:16:17,527 --> 00:16:19,311
Well, it's just what i heard.

379
00:16:19,597 --> 00:16:20,701
Probably gossip.

380
00:16:20,823 --> 00:16:21,825
I wouldn't know.

381
00:16:25,169 --> 00:16:26,859
Anyway, nice to meet
you, jane.

382
00:16:26,915 --> 00:16:29,007
I look forward to getting
to know you better.

383
00:16:29,068 --> 00:16:30,246
Thank you, likewise.

384
00:16:38,847 --> 00:16:41,247
Yeah, we heard that you
and the missus moved in.

385
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:42,410
What do you think?

386
00:16:43,284 --> 00:16:44,284
It's nice.

387
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:46,472
Love it.

388
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,597
Great place.

389
00:16:47,678 --> 00:16:48,226
Nice parks.

390
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:49,222
Good schools.

391
00:16:49,452 --> 00:16:50,722
We're hoping to
start a family.

392
00:16:50,804 --> 00:16:53,926
Well, you couldn't have picked a
better place or a better woman.

393
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:54,943
She's a looker.

394
00:16:55,024 --> 00:16:55,974
She sure is.

395
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:57,897
I'd better grab that.

396
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,781
You're all ready to go.

397
00:17:33,445 --> 00:17:34,500
Looks like a bad one.

398
00:17:35,171 --> 00:17:36,720
Engine caught on fire.

399
00:17:37,132 --> 00:17:39,171
Owner got out,
though, just fine.

400
00:17:39,229 --> 00:17:40,512
That's good to know.

401
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:41,568
70 bucks.

402
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:44,694
This is a nice town.

403
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:45,506
Nice people.

404
00:17:45,561 --> 00:17:46,807
Mostly keep to themselves.

405
00:17:46,994 --> 00:17:48,590
Mind their own business.

406
00:17:49,064 --> 00:17:50,069
That's good.

407
00:17:50,705 --> 00:17:52,647
Some of these
small towns...

408
00:17:52,694 --> 00:17:55,752
Everybody tends to know
what everyone else is up to.

409
00:17:56,446 --> 00:17:58,585
Guess i'll be
seeing you around.

410
00:17:58,695 --> 00:17:59,949
Thanks.

411
00:18:14,588 --> 00:18:17,016
Just ran the vin on
that burned out car.

412
00:18:17,189 --> 00:18:19,444
It's registered
to the feds.

413
00:18:20,472 --> 00:18:21,987
Shane kearny?

414
00:18:22,114 --> 00:18:23,178
The missing agent?

415
00:18:23,243 --> 00:18:25,166
I'll comm riley
in the morning.

416
00:18:26,253 --> 00:18:28,356
You noticed how all the
friendly people in this town

417
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:30,286
aren't all
that friendly?

418
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,026
The smiles don't
run very deep.

419
00:18:36,853 --> 00:18:38,893
How can you watch
that garbage?

420
00:18:39,968 --> 00:18:43,275
You want your laundry coming out
springtime fresh, don't you?

421
00:18:44,893 --> 00:18:46,535
It really is abominable.

422
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,938
... You'd be
surprised how easy this is

423
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:02,702
and what could be nicer than a
sparkling fresh, shiny clean bathroom.

424
00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:05,972
What could be nicer?

425
00:19:12,816 --> 00:19:13,814
Riley.

426
00:19:17,502 --> 00:19:18,502
Riley?

427
00:19:21,488 --> 00:19:23,177
You watching test
patterns now?

428
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,630
What's up, boss?

429
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,528
How are those
background checks going?

430
00:19:29,316 --> 00:19:30,799
Yes.

431
00:19:33,285 --> 00:19:35,886
Well, up until about
four years ago,

432
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:38,164
fair oaks seemed like
a pretty normal place.

433
00:19:38,202 --> 00:19:40,439
A little after that is when
people started disappearing.

434
00:19:40,486 --> 00:19:42,277
I'm trying to narrow
down a list of people

435
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,628
that moved in
around that time.

436
00:19:44,501 --> 00:19:45,959
Sounds like a pretty
long list.

437
00:19:46,004 --> 00:19:49,349
I'll try to pare it down to "most likely's."
Connor check in?

438
00:19:49,441 --> 00:19:51,025
Not since this afternoon.

439
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:53,410
Might be good idea
to raise him on the comm.

440
00:19:53,464 --> 00:19:55,175
- I'll keep trying.
- Good boy.

441
00:19:55,233 --> 00:19:57,164
Stay off
the test patterns.

442
00:20:07,876 --> 00:20:10,130
Man, that smells great!

443
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,833
Come and get it while
it's still hot.

444
00:20:12,885 --> 00:20:14,584
Pancakes, my favorite.

445
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,353
I know, silly.

446
00:20:16,804 --> 00:20:18,365
That's why
i made them.

447
00:20:18,522 --> 00:20:19,486
C'mere.

448
00:20:26,523 --> 00:20:28,268
I've been a real bugger,
haven't i?

449
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,789
I think it's just
your natural charm.

450
00:20:30,893 --> 00:20:34,244
Did it ever occur to you that i've
just been pulling your pigtails?

451
00:20:34,808 --> 00:20:35,536
Yup.

452
00:20:38,206 --> 00:20:39,208
I'm sorry.

453
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:42,230
No excuse for
acting like a jerk.

454
00:20:49,447 --> 00:20:50,770
What do you think?

455
00:20:51,874 --> 00:20:53,158
Best i ever had.

456
00:20:56,152 --> 00:20:57,331
Come here!!

457
00:20:59,643 --> 00:21:01,828
You're beautiful,
you know that?

458
00:21:05,394 --> 00:21:06,745
Why thank you, sir.

459
00:21:07,346 --> 00:21:09,242
You are not
so bad yourself.

460
00:21:24,892 --> 00:21:26,717
Think you could
get used to this?

461
00:21:26,824 --> 00:21:27,945
Pancakes?

462
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:29,068
Hell, yeah.

463
00:21:29,865 --> 00:21:32,211
No, this.

464
00:21:33,068 --> 00:21:34,419
A normal life.

465
00:21:35,632 --> 00:21:36,870
Never had one.

466
00:21:39,067 --> 00:21:40,067
The truth?

467
00:21:41,068 --> 00:21:42,396
It's not that bad.

468
00:21:43,696 --> 00:21:47,841
No one on the team ever
talks about or even thinks much

469
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,964
about their
personal lives.

470
00:21:50,033 --> 00:21:53,779
Do you ever think
about settling down?

471
00:21:54,554 --> 00:21:55,802
Getting married?

472
00:21:56,218 --> 00:21:57,318
Raising a family?

473
00:21:57,837 --> 00:21:59,293
Not until recently.

474
00:22:03,986 --> 00:22:06,749
I guess when you see how
the "other half lives,"

475
00:22:07,633 --> 00:22:10,395
it gives you perspective
on what you're missing.

476
00:22:12,973 --> 00:22:13,759
What?

477
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,811
Just you and me, this.

478
00:22:19,412 --> 00:22:20,660
It feels right.

479
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:29,042
Think we should put
this in our report?

480
00:22:33,053 --> 00:22:35,608
Somehow i don't think
andre would understand.

481
00:22:35,677 --> 00:22:37,862
What he doesn't
know won't hurt him.

482
00:22:43,252 --> 00:22:45,552
You found anything
out of ordinary ?

483
00:22:45,691 --> 00:22:47,495
Wish i could say
we did, boss.

484
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,904
What about
jennifer meyers?

485
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:50,266
I spoke to her.

486
00:22:50,324 --> 00:22:52,012
Honestly, I don't think
she knows any more

487
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:55,162
about susan shaw's disappearance than
she's saying.

488
00:22:55,243 --> 00:22:56,805
Or the bullet hole
in her living room.

489
00:22:56,896 --> 00:23:00,214
How do you know it wasn't just a
misplaced hole from a picture hook?

490
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:02,618
Look, as weird as
the place seems,

491
00:23:02,676 --> 00:23:05,260
Don't you think as cops, we start to get
a jaded take on things?

492
00:23:05,312 --> 00:23:07,381
All we ever see's
the dark side.

493
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:10,064
We come across some place
nice and decent

494
00:23:10,121 --> 00:23:13,019
and first thing we think is,
"something's gotta be wrong."

495
00:23:13,121 --> 00:23:14,104
There is something wrong!

496
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:16,971
There are three missing people
and a missing federal agent.

497
00:23:17,052 --> 00:23:18,054
We're working on it.

498
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:20,936
We just haven't found
anything yet.

499
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,841
Between you and me.

500
00:23:31,945 --> 00:23:34,199
I'm a little jealous that
jane got this assignment.

501
00:23:34,261 --> 00:23:35,200
You shouldn't be.

502
00:23:36,076 --> 00:23:38,480
Jane's a good woman
and a good agent.

503
00:23:38,515 --> 00:23:39,891
And it's just work.

504
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:47,698
You telling me

505
00:23:56,107 --> 00:23:57,714
You're gonna be much longer ?

506
00:23:57,974 --> 00:24:00,396
Just finishing up
with the dishes.

507
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:07,659
Damn!

508
00:24:12,089 --> 00:24:14,968
What do you think about
new curtains in the kitchen?

509
00:24:25,369 --> 00:24:25,843
Sure, fine.

510
00:24:25,915 --> 00:24:28,165
That sounds great.

511
00:24:37,885 --> 00:24:39,862
Hon,
dinner was fantastic.

512
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:43,480
Glad you enjoyed that.

513
00:24:45,505 --> 00:24:47,160
So guess who's in charge
of side dishes

514
00:24:47,226 --> 00:24:49,766
and condiments at the rent
committee picnic?

515
00:24:50,541 --> 00:24:51,535
Congratulations.

516
00:24:51,639 --> 00:24:53,038
It's gonna be great.

517
00:24:53,662 --> 00:24:56,668
We're gonna throw a barbecue
like no one ever saw.

518
00:24:56,726 --> 00:24:58,274
Well, sounds like
a lot of fun.

519
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:00,843
You know what
else would be fun?

520
00:25:01,629 --> 00:25:06,045
When you finish these dishes
if you met me upstairs.

521
00:25:09,409 --> 00:25:10,410
I will.

522
00:25:11,662 --> 00:25:13,465
Just give me
a few minutes.

523
00:25:13,536 --> 00:25:15,315
Don't keep daddy waiting.

524
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,130
What do you got?

525
00:25:49,227 --> 00:25:53,279
I think I might have figured out how the
neuro's able to operate over such a large area.

526
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,332
How's that?

527
00:26:01,762 --> 00:26:06,167
Don't you think you ought to tell me
just how valuable i am to the team?

528
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:09,524
Riley,

529
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:14,968
have i ever told you how
valuable you are to this team.

530
00:26:15,587 --> 00:26:16,910
I know i give
you grief...

531
00:26:18,668 --> 00:26:21,315
We couldn't run
this operation without you.

532
00:26:28,665 --> 00:26:30,619
What the hell
just happened?

533
00:26:32,504 --> 00:26:34,446
Yeah, boss,
i love you too.

534
00:26:37,047 --> 00:26:39,371
I was running an
ultrasonic frequency

535
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:42,319
that seems to affect
the alpha region of the brain.

536
00:26:43,837 --> 00:26:46,372
Makes people very
receptive to suggestion.

537
00:26:47,776 --> 00:26:48,823
Alright...

538
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,332
I'm listening.

539
00:26:53,332 --> 00:26:54,340
I was running
some tests

540
00:26:54,392 --> 00:26:56,665
on the local community
channel bandwidth.

541
00:26:56,711 --> 00:26:59,694
Every house in fair oaks
is receiving this frequency.

542
00:27:00,723 --> 00:27:03,228
But you had to give me
that suggestion verbally...

543
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,288
In person.

544
00:27:05,047 --> 00:27:05,799
True.

545
00:27:07,024 --> 00:27:08,631
But i'm not a neuro.

546
00:27:10,169 --> 00:27:12,414
You put a neuro together
with this frequency,

547
00:27:12,492 --> 00:27:15,140
in theory, the range of
their power could be unlimited.

548
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:18,020
Proximity's
no longer an issue.

549
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:20,309
Not for this one.

550
00:27:21,581 --> 00:27:22,887
Something else...

551
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,271
The longer you're
exposed to it

552
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:29,144
the deeper
it'll take root.

553
00:27:31,017 --> 00:27:31,919
Meaning?

554
00:27:32,381 --> 00:27:33,896
Something like drugs.

555
00:27:34,416 --> 00:27:36,820
Recreational at first
but after awhile...

556
00:27:38,789 --> 00:27:40,589
You might be willing
to kill for it.

557
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:48,391
I've got my rent committee
meeting later on today.

558
00:27:48,437 --> 00:27:51,362
Probably won't
be home too late.

559
00:27:51,422 --> 00:27:52,622
Miss me?

560
00:27:52,818 --> 00:27:53,743
Counting the minutes.

561
00:27:53,836 --> 00:27:55,813
Alright, bye, hon.

562
00:28:03,218 --> 00:28:06,131
Hey, guys,
look it's me,

563
00:28:06,178 --> 00:28:09,028
i don't know what's going on here
i can't explain it.

564
00:28:09,091 --> 00:28:11,502
Maybe because i heal
more quickly than connor.

565
00:28:11,583 --> 00:28:13,807
Have you been watching
the community channel?

566
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,942
It's on
quite a bit, yes.

567
00:28:18,556 --> 00:28:20,372
Not last night, though.

568
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:21,019
Why?

569
00:28:21,117 --> 00:28:23,089
Just a theory
we're working on.

570
00:28:23,367 --> 00:28:26,499
In the meantime, i suggest you turn
the damn thing off.

571
00:28:27,866 --> 00:28:29,297
What've you got?

572
00:28:30,118 --> 00:28:32,180
We found the federal
agent, shane kearny's car...

573
00:28:32,231 --> 00:28:33,630
We didn't report that.

574
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,803
And mo was right about
that bullet hole.

575
00:28:35,873 --> 00:28:36,870
Any suspects?

576
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,491
At this point, it
could be anyone.

577
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,428
My guess would be

578
00:28:40,508 --> 00:28:42,018
Someone on
the town council.

579
00:28:42,741 --> 00:28:46,307
Someone in a position to make the
rules, call the shots.

580
00:28:46,369 --> 00:28:47,371
Riley have anything?

581
00:28:47,869 --> 00:28:51,719
I've got a list of people who moved into
fair oaks since the incidents began.

582
00:28:52,371 --> 00:28:54,359
It's not as short
as i'd like.

583
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:56,128
Do what you can.

584
00:28:56,186 --> 00:28:56,854
In the meantime,

585
00:28:56,891 --> 00:28:59,758
i'll try to get some samples
from the most likely suspects.

586
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:00,949
Jane...

587
00:29:01,191 --> 00:29:02,196
How's connor?

588
00:29:03,572 --> 00:29:04,572
I don't know.

589
00:29:05,633 --> 00:29:08,220
He doesn't seem quite
as far gone as the others.

590
00:29:09,386 --> 00:29:10,997
That'll change over time.

591
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:13,090
I wouldn't let him know
what you're up to.

592
00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:13,844
Got it.

593
00:29:14,006 --> 00:29:16,596
I'll get to work on collecting samples,
you arrange for a drop.

594
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,717
No, no, no,
better let me contact you.

595
00:29:21,197 --> 00:29:22,584
Forgot my jacket.

596
00:29:22,697 --> 00:29:23,694
Later hon.

597
00:29:31,389 --> 00:29:32,372
What do you think?

598
00:29:32,441 --> 00:29:33,447
I don't know.

599
00:29:34,129 --> 00:29:36,333
Have to wait and see
what she comes up with.

600
00:29:46,761 --> 00:29:47,725
Geeze!!

601
00:29:50,072 --> 00:29:51,517
Connor's busy
with the picnic.

602
00:29:51,574 --> 00:29:52,723
I don't have much time.

603
00:29:52,823 --> 00:29:53,938
You have the samples?

604
00:29:55,621 --> 00:29:57,848
I'll need a chip gun
if any of those test positive.

605
00:29:57,883 --> 00:29:58,885
Too risky.

606
00:29:59,513 --> 00:30:00,563
If connor finds it...

607
00:30:00,948 --> 00:30:01,948
I see.

608
00:30:03,317 --> 00:30:05,398
And you're not
that sure about me.

609
00:30:05,467 --> 00:30:06,762
We'll run the tests.

610
00:30:06,819 --> 00:30:09,112
- I'll let you know.
- Andre...

611
00:30:10,698 --> 00:30:11,794
It's definitely a positive.

612
00:30:11,841 --> 00:30:12,523
Who is it?

613
00:30:12,569 --> 00:30:13,228
The mayor.

614
00:30:13,286 --> 00:30:14,280
Roger bischoff.

615
00:30:14,349 --> 00:30:15,112
How can you help ?

616
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:16,014
The mayor?

617
00:30:17,763 --> 00:30:18,863
I'll get hold of jane.

618
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,300
She knows we're
on our way.

619
00:30:20,386 --> 00:30:21,586
She'll run interference.

620
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:22,824
Connor?

621
00:30:22,872 --> 00:30:24,675
Right now,
connor is not on our side.

622
00:30:25,701 --> 00:30:28,756
Look, even if you
chip this guy...

623
00:30:30,012 --> 00:30:32,305
I don't know how quickly
his influence will last

624
00:30:32,386 --> 00:30:34,850
especially if that station's
still transmitting.

625
00:30:35,322 --> 00:30:37,253
Can you do
something about it?

626
00:30:38,762 --> 00:30:41,412
I can short out the grid
that powers the transmitter.

627
00:30:41,886 --> 00:30:42,936
But here's the catch.

628
00:30:43,139 --> 00:30:45,010
Power company's backup
will kick in as soon as

629
00:30:45,045 --> 00:30:47,461
they pick up on
the interruption.

630
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:49,261
Can you block it?

631
00:30:49,324 --> 00:30:50,928
Yeah, if i had
a couple of days.

632
00:30:51,573 --> 00:30:54,325
Right now, i can bring
the transmitter down.

633
00:30:54,371 --> 00:30:58,963
But only for about
16 minutes.

634
00:30:59,387 --> 00:31:01,229
That's your window.

635
00:31:01,309 --> 00:31:02,309
We've gotta roll.

636
00:31:02,373 --> 00:31:03,710
Jane's expecting
us at 2100.

637
00:31:04,808 --> 00:31:06,162
Well, that's all done.

638
00:31:06,874 --> 00:31:09,779
I think i'm going to take
a walk and get some air.

639
00:31:10,811 --> 00:31:12,911
Did you really think
it was going to work?

640
00:31:14,241 --> 00:31:15,433
What are you
talking about?

641
00:31:15,495 --> 00:31:16,434
You.

642
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,455
Betraying the town.

643
00:31:19,309 --> 00:31:20,309
And me.

644
00:31:21,686 --> 00:31:25,286
And if you think those DNA  samples are
going to do any good, they won't.

645
00:31:25,686 --> 00:31:27,136
Did a little
bait and switch.

646
00:31:28,436 --> 00:31:30,136
You're the talk
of the town, jane.

647
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,835
Doesn't seem you have
too many friends left.

648
00:31:42,795 --> 00:31:43,845
The mayor works late.

649
00:31:43,982 --> 00:31:45,432
I'm sure he's
very dedicated.

650
00:31:45,854 --> 00:31:47,604
Something tells me i've
got a better chance

651
00:31:47,649 --> 00:31:48,805
at getting close
to him.

652
00:31:48,875 --> 00:31:49,499
It's not skill.

653
00:31:49,545 --> 00:31:51,533
Just something
i was born with.

654
00:31:57,626 --> 00:31:58,854
No sign of jane.

655
00:31:59,557 --> 00:32:00,740
We can't wait.

656
00:32:00,792 --> 00:32:01,966
You've got 16 minutes.

657
00:32:02,035 --> 00:32:04,023
I'll be right behind you.

658
00:32:04,105 --> 00:32:04,601
Riley.

659
00:32:04,648 --> 00:32:05,744
Take it down, now!

660
00:33:21,486 --> 00:33:22,538
Excuse me.

661
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:24,098
Hi.

662
00:33:24,156 --> 00:33:24,842
Hi.

663
00:33:24,896 --> 00:33:25,994
Can i help you?

664
00:33:26,052 --> 00:33:28,401
I have taken a wrong
turn somewhere

665
00:33:28,475 --> 00:33:30,736
and can't
find a gas station that is open.

666
00:33:30,779 --> 00:33:31,970
Where did you want to go?

667
00:33:32,031 --> 00:33:32,903
Calumet.

668
00:33:32,968 --> 00:33:37,633
I thought i was supposed to turn south
on the interstate you wanted to go...

669
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:41,818
Fifteen east.

670
00:33:45,468 --> 00:33:48,618
I'm going to mark it on the map here,
it's about 15-20 minutes.

671
00:33:48,686 --> 00:33:49,183
Thank you.

672
00:33:49,229 --> 00:33:50,478
If i could get
my pen to work.

673
00:33:50,501 --> 00:33:53,577
You think the mayor's office
would have a pen that worked.

674
00:33:53,658 --> 00:33:54,657
Hold it!

675
00:33:58,875 --> 00:34:01,320
I wouldn't do that
if i were you, sheriff.

676
00:34:04,719 --> 00:34:07,106
Just put it down.

677
00:34:12,377 --> 00:34:14,689
This might
change your mind.

678
00:34:18,123 --> 00:34:19,464
Connor found out.

679
00:34:19,556 --> 00:34:20,500
Where's mo?

680
00:34:20,811 --> 00:34:22,557
The mayor tested positive.

681
00:34:23,689 --> 00:34:26,464
It's not the mayor,
connor switched the samples.

682
00:34:33,781 --> 00:34:34,475
Mo!!

683
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,187
Hand me that gun!!

684
00:34:55,564 --> 00:34:56,564
Slowly.

685
00:35:03,988 --> 00:35:08,381
Now, picnic's not til
the day after tomorrow.

686
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,039
But i'm sure,
in a little while,

687
00:35:10,624 --> 00:35:11,927
you'll be eager
to attend.

688
00:35:12,923 --> 00:35:13,923
Let's go.

689
00:35:52,814 --> 00:35:54,300
Mo, mo...

690
00:35:57,039 --> 00:35:58,091
But I....

691
00:35:59,682 --> 00:36:01,994
I chipped him.

692
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:34,129
The world is a decaying,
rotten place, mr. Mcbride.

693
00:36:34,206 --> 00:36:38,661
Full of criminals, liars,
adulterers and filth.

694
00:36:38,707 --> 00:36:41,346
In fair oaks,
we've shut all of that out.

695
00:36:41,924 --> 00:36:43,393
We live well here.

696
00:36:44,268 --> 00:36:45,531
People are happy.

697
00:36:46,699 --> 00:36:48,028
It's a nice place.

698
00:36:49,394 --> 00:36:51,096
Your version of nice.

699
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:54,090
Well, isn't it always
someone's version.

700
00:36:54,148 --> 00:36:56,032
And frankly,
i prefer mine.

701
00:36:56,078 --> 00:36:58,703
No matter how many people
you have to kill along the way.

702
00:36:59,942 --> 00:37:01,196
For the greater good.

703
00:37:01,271 --> 00:37:04,023
I'm sure you're familiar
with the concept.

704
00:37:04,083 --> 00:37:06,462
If you're thinking
on leaving...

705
00:37:06,589 --> 00:37:08,826
Well, I do believe you'll 
have a change of heart very soon.

706
00:37:09,867 --> 00:37:11,439
Seeing as we're
having some problems

707
00:37:11,497 --> 00:37:12,688
with our broadcast
facility,

708
00:37:12,723 --> 00:37:16,375
i'll have to
extend my invitation personally.

709
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:20,817
Come on, boss, it'll
all be over in a second.

710
00:37:40,512 --> 00:37:40,963
I...

711
00:37:41,044 --> 00:37:42,754
Don't even say a word.

712
00:37:53,347 --> 00:37:55,580
You were close enough
to chip that woman.

713
00:37:57,029 --> 00:37:58,162
Yes, i was.

714
00:39:01,379 --> 00:39:06,951
Maureen and i met the first
day of academy orientation.

715
00:39:08,589 --> 00:39:12,119
I was wearing jeans
and combat boots,

716
00:39:12,329 --> 00:39:16,318
while she was sporting this

717
00:39:16,618 --> 00:39:19,578
versace strapless and...

718
00:39:20,699 --> 00:39:23,046
ferregamo stilettos.

719
00:39:23,404 --> 00:39:24,942
The first thing
i thought was

720
00:39:25,028 --> 00:39:28,607
how inappropriately
she was dressed

721
00:39:28,654 --> 00:39:31,000
for a career in
law enforcement.

722
00:39:31,809 --> 00:39:36,003
And secondly I noticed how much
more attention the...

723
00:39:36,098 --> 00:39:38,537
instructor was giving her than me.

724
00:39:40,259 --> 00:39:42,805
We were opposites in every way

725
00:39:45,464 --> 00:39:48,296
Which is why, of course, the...

726
00:39:48,388 --> 00:39:50,527
the E.A made us a team.

727
00:39:51,742 --> 00:39:53,869
But the weird thing is

728
00:39:56,274 --> 00:39:57,314
it worked.

729
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:01,719
She turned out to be one tough chick

730
00:40:02,543 --> 00:40:04,046
Who had my back

731
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,971
and I had hers.

732
00:40:08,138 --> 00:40:09,375
worked out good.

733
00:40:12,303 --> 00:40:13,782
until one day it didn't

734
00:40:17,077 --> 00:40:21,008
I can't say that we were really friends

735
00:40:23,368 --> 00:40:25,207
but in some ways

736
00:40:26,536 --> 00:40:28,790
It went a lot deeper than that.

737
00:40:30,374 --> 00:40:31,288
I mean...

738
00:40:32,999 --> 00:40:34,131
How often...

739
00:40:35,458 --> 00:40:39,492
do you trust your life, to a friend ?

740
00:40:40,487 --> 00:40:43,735
I've trustedmy life to Maureen
every day.

741
00:40:46,372 --> 00:40:48,233
and when she died,

742
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:54,060
she was part of the team
that had her back too

743
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,859
we did our best

744
00:41:01,506 --> 00:41:02,674
all of us.

745
00:41:07,078 --> 00:41:08,315
She knew that.

746
00:41:12,148 --> 00:41:13,246
We'll miss her.

747
00:41:17,663 --> 00:41:19,339
I'll really miss her.

748
00:42:03,172 --> 00:42:06,929
There was a time when, all I'd wanted
is to go home

749
00:42:07,056 --> 00:42:11,230
lock the doors, close the blinds,
and be left alone.

750
00:42:12,004 --> 00:42:14,237
No one in my face, asking me if

751
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,596
I wanted to talk about it.

752
00:42:16,642 --> 00:42:20,446
No one watching me with
care, and concern in their eyes.

753
00:42:21,093 --> 00:42:24,345
No one to feel sorry for,
except myself.

754
00:42:25,234 --> 00:42:26,772
A lot has changed.

755
00:42:27,153 --> 00:42:28,147
Right now,

756
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:31,176
I don't want to be alone at all.

757
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
