1
00:00:00,853 --> 00:00:02,264
My name is jane vasco.

2
00:00:02,308 --> 00:00:03,676
I could use
you on my team.

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,263
I work for a secret government
agency that hunts neuros.

4
00:00:07,307 --> 00:00:11,321
People who can do dangerous
things with their minds.

5
00:00:11,468 --> 00:00:12,879
On my first assignment...

6
00:00:12,909 --> 00:00:14,973
Something a little
weird happened,

7
00:00:15,103 --> 00:00:18,514
okay, something
really weird.

8
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:23,321
Until i get some answers
i'm getting on with my life,
doing my job.

9
00:00:23,409 --> 00:00:28,549
Stocking up on aspirin,
because I gotta tell ya,

10
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:30,205
pain's a bitch!

11
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:34,997
Big Line Thirsday. Arsonist has finally been
apprehended by local authorities.

12
00:00:35,056 --> 00:00:37,882
After allegedly burning another house to
the ground in north salem last night

13
00:00:37,985 --> 00:00:39,646
the serial arsonist and public
enemy number 1

14
00:00:39,705 --> 00:00:41,625
for this community has
apparently been apprehended.

15
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:42,719
Trial begins today.

16
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:45,292
Up to the minute coverage
right here on action news.

17
00:00:45,688 --> 00:00:49,043
My partner and I were on routine
patrol when we saw the flames.

18
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:52,087
Would you tell the court
what happened next.

19
00:00:52,175 --> 00:00:55,718
We arrived at the samuel's house and
saw the suspect fleeing from the scene.

20
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:57,791
When he refused to obey
our orders

21
00:00:57,865 --> 00:00:59,294
my partner fired
a warning shot.

22
00:00:59,382 --> 00:01:02,308
Was that sufficient to stop the defendant
from attempting to escape?

23
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:03,352
No, sir.

24
00:01:03,411 --> 00:01:05,028
I fired at the suspect.

25
00:01:05,102 --> 00:01:06,969
My shot hit
him in the leg.

26
00:01:07,013 --> 00:01:09,630
It was at that point that
we were able to subdue him

27
00:01:09,674 --> 00:01:10,674
and take him into custody.

28
00:01:10,733 --> 00:01:13,833
The police alerted us to
the fire just after 10:00 am.

29
00:01:15,318 --> 00:01:18,553
Two of our units
responded, including emu.

30
00:01:18,626 --> 00:01:19,743
By the time we
got there...

31
00:01:19,802 --> 00:01:24,478
...The fire had already reached the second
story of the samuel's house.

32
00:01:24,566 --> 00:01:26,895
How long did it take
to get control of the fire?

33
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:29,512
It took about an hour
before I felt that it was safe

34
00:01:29,586 --> 00:01:31,512
for my men
to enter the structure.

35
00:01:31,571 --> 00:01:33,144
Would you tell us
what you discovered.

36
00:01:33,217 --> 00:01:35,408
Most of the ground
floor was gone.

37
00:01:35,496 --> 00:01:37,466
There was enough left
of the support beams

38
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,737
to keep the house
from collapsing.

39
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,795
After you entered...

40
00:01:42,868 --> 00:01:46,000
What was your first impressions
as to what caused the fire?

41
00:01:46,117 --> 00:01:49,999
As we passed through the main entry
of the house, I noticed a "hot spot."

42
00:01:50,987 --> 00:01:51,972
could you explain that?

43
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:56,000
Usually the location where the fire
begins is the hottest spot.

44
00:01:56,118 --> 00:01:58,882
Usually you'd expect to see
the hot spot in a kitchen,

45
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,812
near a stove, or in the case
of an electrical fire,

46
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,355
near wiring or
circuit breakers...

47
00:02:03,385 --> 00:02:04,458
Something like that.

48
00:02:04,502 --> 00:02:06,236
Was that the case in
the samuel's house?

49
00:02:06,311 --> 00:02:06,958
No.

50
00:02:07,016 --> 00:02:10,119
My first impression was that
the ignition point of the fire

51
00:02:10,177 --> 00:02:12,838
was a small bathroom
on the ground floor.

52
00:02:12,912 --> 00:02:13,994
Is that unusual?

53
00:02:14,038 --> 00:02:17,213
It's not unheard of but,
yes, it is unusual.

54
00:02:17,302 --> 00:02:22,080
Unless there's indication of flammable
materials or electrical problems.

55
00:02:22,168 --> 00:02:25,123
Given what you saw,
did you form an opinion?

56
00:02:25,182 --> 00:02:29,493
My first reaction was
that, like the others...

57
00:02:29,552 --> 00:02:32,330
This was an arson fire
of unknown origin.

58
00:02:32,374 --> 00:02:35,474
Was there anything else of note
about this downstairs bathroom?

59
00:02:36,594 --> 00:02:37,638
Yes.

60
00:02:37,726 --> 00:02:38,608
And what was that?

61
00:02:38,696 --> 00:02:41,224
We found charred,
human remains.

62
00:02:42,091 --> 00:02:45,943
Were these "remains" those that were
later identified as lucy samuel's,

63
00:02:46,012 --> 00:02:48,237
one of the occupants
of the house?

64
00:02:48,413 --> 00:02:49,266
Yes, sir.

65
00:02:49,589 --> 00:02:50,457
Thank you.

66
00:02:50,515 --> 00:02:51,383
That's all.

67
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:56,549
Would defense counsel care
to present any witnesses
at this time?

68
00:02:56,622 --> 00:02:58,269
No, your honor.

69
00:02:58,357 --> 00:03:01,180
We would, however, appreciate
an expeditious ruling

70
00:03:01,253 --> 00:03:02,783
on our
request for bail.

71
00:03:02,841 --> 00:03:05,020
Given the severity
of the charges,

72
00:03:05,076 --> 00:03:08,651
serial arson and second degree murder,
i'm going to rule

73
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:11,180
that the defendant will
be bound over for trial

74
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:13,474
and held
at the county jail.

75
00:03:14,047 --> 00:03:15,517
Bail is denied.

76
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,233
It's just the preliminary,
not the trial.

77
00:03:21,336 --> 00:03:22,983
So where do we
go from here?

78
00:03:23,056 --> 00:03:24,012
To work.

79
00:03:35,866 --> 00:03:41,585
Transcript : swsub.com
Presync : IceFre@k

80
00:03:44,671 --> 00:03:45,744
Connor King.

81
00:03:46,156 --> 00:03:46,994
Ex-cop.

82
00:03:47,523 --> 00:03:48,376
Ex-con.

83
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:52,743
Kinda cute in a borderline
sociopath kind of way.

84
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:56,462
God, i can't believe
i just thought that.

85
00:03:56,686 --> 00:03:57,760
Here's the deal:

86
00:03:57,873 --> 00:04:00,656
i'm able to heal,
and connor isn't,

87
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:02,474
but he keeps taking
one for the team.

88
00:04:03,082 --> 00:04:06,081
Either he's mental or
there's more to the man

89
00:04:06,169 --> 00:04:08,047
than he wants
people to see.

90
00:04:08,312 --> 00:04:13,237
Check that, he's definitely mental,
but he's also a good act.

91
00:04:13,561 --> 00:04:19,104
He works hard to keep people at 
arm's length, but then so do I.

92
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:21,802
Maybe we're more alike
than i'd like to admit.

93
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:28,241
Except he loves to be hated
and maybe would hate to know

94
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:32,534
every once in a
while he's loved.

95
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,760
Here's what we're
up against.

96
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:43,789
Public opinion's
running pretty high.

97
00:04:43,877 --> 00:04:45,435
People want
someone to blame.

98
00:04:45,582 --> 00:04:46,964
There is someone to blame.

99
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:48,483
A pyromaniac neuro.

100
00:04:48,556 --> 00:04:50,600
I work for the government
just like you do.

101
00:04:50,747 --> 00:04:52,379
We know the truth here.

102
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,921
The public doesn't know
anything of neuros.

103
00:05:00,098 --> 00:05:02,231
So the truth isn't always
the best defense.

104
00:05:02,328 --> 00:05:03,571
That's reassuring.

105
00:05:03,641 --> 00:05:06,641
We're not here to reassure you,
we're here to acquit connor.

106
00:05:06,732 --> 00:05:07,687
What're we looking at?

107
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,516
Facts that don't
look good for connor.

108
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:13,627
First, he's been identified
at three of the six fires.

109
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:15,591
Because we've been on
the trail of the neuro

110
00:05:15,693 --> 00:05:17,241
who's been starting
those fires.

111
00:05:19,657 --> 00:05:20,428
Go on.

112
00:05:20,563 --> 00:05:24,463
Connor, against your orders, 
broke position and entered that house.

113
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,240
Yeah, to try and apprehend
the damn fire starter.

114
00:05:28,275 --> 00:05:29,589
Look, i understand
your thinking.

115
00:05:29,651 --> 00:05:33,662
But i want you to consider for a moment
how the jury would react

116
00:05:33,721 --> 00:05:35,088
if i put any one of
you on the stand

117
00:05:35,156 --> 00:05:37,771
and asked you testify to
the existence of people

118
00:05:37,841 --> 00:05:41,228
who possess the ability to
start fires with their mind.

119
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:45,157
The truth isn't always
the best defense.

120
00:05:46,089 --> 00:05:50,317
Witnesses have placed connor
at the scene of multiple arsons.

121
00:05:50,401 --> 00:05:53,245
He was apprehended exiting
the samuel's house...

122
00:05:55,492 --> 00:05:57,688
And then there's his
criminal record.

123
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:00,405
Is that admissible?

124
00:06:00,817 --> 00:06:03,369
Evidence only requires
exclusion when probative value

125
00:06:03,403 --> 00:06:05,216
is substantially
outweighed by the danger

126
00:06:05,217 --> 00:06:09,322
of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues,
or misleading the jury.

127
00:06:09,404 --> 00:06:11,841
The present rule recognizes the
practice of admitting evidence

128
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:12,892
for a limited purpose

129
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,754
and instructing
the jury accordingly.

130
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,226
How the hell did
you know that?

131
00:06:19,367 --> 00:06:21,331
I read up on
it last night.

132
00:06:25,542 --> 00:06:27,737
So the judge can admit
connor's criminal record.

133
00:06:27,781 --> 00:06:30,925
Given miss vasco's very
accurate recital of the law...

134
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:31,840
Yes.

135
00:06:32,031 --> 00:06:34,935
Hell, why even bother
having the trial!

136
00:06:34,966 --> 00:06:37,217
It sounds as if he's already
been tried and convicted.

137
00:06:37,878 --> 00:06:38,819
I'm not going
to lie to you.

138
00:06:38,867 --> 00:06:40,454
We're facing an
uphill battle here.

139
00:06:40,548 --> 00:06:44,004
But the war's not over until
we've taken our best shots
at all the evidence.

140
00:06:44,524 --> 00:06:45,778
Given everything
you told us,

141
00:06:45,853 --> 00:06:47,655
it sounds like truth
may be our best shot.

142
00:06:47,712 --> 00:06:50,527
Why don't we tell the jury what we're
really dealing with.

143
00:06:50,585 --> 00:06:52,185
It's not as if we
can't prove it.

144
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,384
Even if you're right...

145
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,266
You're sworn to silence
and secrecy.

146
00:06:55,908 --> 00:06:57,567
Our hands are tied.

147
00:06:57,908 --> 00:06:59,942
Maybe it's time
to cut the knot.

148
00:07:10,573 --> 00:07:13,278
What you should have done
is made this all go away
before it even started.

149
00:07:13,337 --> 00:07:15,463
You'll have to explain
that to me, agent mcbride.

150
00:07:15,525 --> 00:07:17,713
As your superior,
i do have connections
in high places.

151
00:07:17,798 --> 00:07:19,174
As high as they go.

152
00:07:23,632 --> 00:07:26,138
However, they don't extend
into the heavens.

153
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,215
Heavens?

154
00:07:27,335 --> 00:07:28,151
What is that
supposed to mean?

155
00:07:28,194 --> 00:07:29,652
Only god can
save connor?

156
00:07:29,711 --> 00:07:30,687
Don't give me that crap!

157
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:31,902
Disagreement, i encourage,
sir.

158
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:34,287
I will not tolerate
insubordination.

159
00:07:34,342 --> 00:07:35,339
Hell, we've covered up

160
00:07:35,404 --> 00:07:36,654
the assassinations
of foreign leaders.

161
00:07:36,698 --> 00:07:37,655
Our own leaders!

162
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,026
But when it comes
to connor king...

163
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:40,449
The man was shot
at the scene...

164
00:07:40,531 --> 00:07:41,278
By the police.

165
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:42,829
The case of the
decade, solved.

166
00:07:44,024 --> 00:07:44,842
It was on the front pages

167
00:07:44,907 --> 00:07:46,988
before they'd read
him his miranda.

168
00:07:47,047 --> 00:07:50,602
How, exactly, did you expect us to
make that "go away?"

169
00:07:50,767 --> 00:07:52,096
then let us
present the truth.

170
00:07:52,179 --> 00:07:53,955
Admit to the existence
of neuros.

171
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,341
Only as much as
we have to.

172
00:07:55,484 --> 00:07:56,613
Need to know.

173
00:07:57,566 --> 00:07:59,302
And when the prosecution
demands proof...

174
00:07:59,369 --> 00:07:59,990
What then?

175
00:08:00,028 --> 00:08:00,866
We give it to them!

176
00:08:00,969 --> 00:08:02,051
We've got years
of caseloads.

177
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,301
That would not only bring
something to the surface

178
00:08:03,345 --> 00:08:05,051
that we've worked very
hard to keep secret...

179
00:08:05,121 --> 00:08:07,579
But would compromise
your team as well.

180
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,511
"Need to know" rapidly
becomes full exposure.

181
00:08:10,558 --> 00:08:12,593
It might be connor's
only chance.

182
00:08:12,663 --> 00:08:13,945
And it might not.

183
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,928
Are you willing to see
your unit de-commissioned

184
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:20,265
to risk a defense that, chances are,
no one would ever believe...

185
00:08:20,335 --> 00:08:21,770
Despite your proof?

186
00:08:22,429 --> 00:08:24,252
And if they did believe
it and connor was acquitted...

187
00:08:24,429 --> 00:08:26,722
The result would be a
population in panic

188
00:08:26,805 --> 00:08:28,364
and our ability to keep our
operations a secret

189
00:08:28,414 --> 00:08:31,519
and fight these
"things" compromised.

190
00:08:32,425 --> 00:08:34,565
Is one man really
worth that much?

191
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:37,906
That one man happens
to be innocent.

192
00:08:38,647 --> 00:08:40,058
Soldiers do die in battle.

193
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,128
A soldier

194
00:08:42,163 --> 00:08:45,174
dying on the field,
in combat,

195
00:08:47,585 --> 00:08:49,872
is something that
can't be undone.

196
00:08:49,978 --> 00:08:51,001
Connor isn't dead.

197
00:08:51,048 --> 00:08:52,079
You know as
well as i do...

198
00:08:52,142 --> 00:08:53,847
He was always a liability.

199
00:08:54,976 --> 00:08:56,106
Liability?

200
00:08:56,964 --> 00:08:58,376
What is that
supposed to mean?

201
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:01,265
Feed him to the wolves
because you don't like
his attitude?

202
00:09:01,391 --> 00:09:03,261
Consider this,
agent mcbride...

203
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:04,708
With all you do know...

204
00:09:04,813 --> 00:09:05,643
If i were to permit
this...

205
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:06,794
Put you on the stand...

206
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,383
Armed with all
your evidence...

207
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,081
Simply because the fires
are of unknown origin,

208
00:09:11,141 --> 00:09:14,391
you can't prove that
a neuro is behind them.

209
00:09:24,895 --> 00:09:25,895
Great.

210
00:09:27,331 --> 00:09:28,267
The first time
i get you alone

211
00:09:28,316 --> 00:09:29,718
and we've got
see-thru doors.

212
00:09:30,392 --> 00:09:32,091
My luck's
turned to crap.

213
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,400
You know
what they say...

214
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:37,729
It ain't over
'til it's over.

215
00:09:37,905 --> 00:09:38,752
What the hell
do "they" know?

216
00:09:38,823 --> 00:09:39,752
They're out there.

217
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:44,853
If andre sent you to cheer
me up, you should know...

218
00:09:45,653 --> 00:09:47,899
You really suck at it.

219
00:09:48,052 --> 00:09:48,505
Maybe.

220
00:09:48,617 --> 00:09:50,781
But andre doesn't
have my legs.

221
00:09:51,569 --> 00:09:53,063
What aren't
you telling me?

222
00:09:53,169 --> 00:09:53,881
It's the truth.

223
00:09:53,933 --> 00:09:55,424
He's got lousy legs.

224
00:09:58,847 --> 00:10:00,399
Andre just got word...

225
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:02,822
No mention of
the team,

226
00:10:03,328 --> 00:10:05,669
what we do...
or neuros.

227
00:10:07,005 --> 00:10:08,040
Great.

228
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:12,098
So i end up looking like a guy who
likes to hang around fires.

229
00:10:12,286 --> 00:10:13,639
Who happens to have
a criminal record.

230
00:10:13,662 --> 00:10:15,874
We're trying to
keep that out.

231
00:10:16,238 --> 00:10:17,748
We'll come up
with something.

232
00:10:17,771 --> 00:10:18,900
My neck in a noose.

233
00:10:18,948 --> 00:10:19,823
Connor, listen it...

234
00:10:19,824 --> 00:10:20,824
Save it, bowers.

235
00:10:21,014 --> 00:10:22,070
We all know the risks.

236
00:10:22,071 --> 00:10:23,510
I'd rather gone down
takin' out one of

237
00:10:23,511 --> 00:10:24,861
those mental
defects but...

238
00:10:26,757 --> 00:10:28,523
We don't always get to make
that choice, i guess.

239
00:10:28,701 --> 00:10:29,889
Andre's still trying
to get the truth out.

240
00:10:29,949 --> 00:10:32,371
No, bad idea.

241
00:10:32,453 --> 00:10:33,574
He'd only
compromise the team.

242
00:10:33,618 --> 00:10:36,099
If i have go down
for this, i go down.

243
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,463
Fall on your sword, man
of honor kind of thing.

244
00:10:38,544 --> 00:10:39,944
The hell with that.

245
00:10:40,085 --> 00:10:43,802
Figure at least maybe i'd get a going
away present from you and supergirl.

246
00:10:45,601 --> 00:10:46,526
What?

247
00:10:46,836 --> 00:10:48,121
Just nice to know that,

248
00:10:48,177 --> 00:10:53,626
even in a moment of strength and
character, you're still a pig.

249
00:10:55,473 --> 00:10:56,931
Hang in there.

250
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:01,106
Guard!

251
00:11:10,899 --> 00:11:12,040
Twenty-three
years old.

252
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,540
Married just
under two years.

253
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:14,915
Killed in an arson fire.

254
00:11:16,004 --> 00:11:18,833
Those faces are what's
going to hang connor.

255
00:11:19,085 --> 00:11:19,878
No...

256
00:11:19,937 --> 00:11:22,495
Regulations and his past are what's
going to hang connor.

257
00:11:22,619 --> 00:11:24,246
If they admit his
criminal history.

258
00:11:24,407 --> 00:11:27,371
That's no longer an "if."
the judge is admitting it.

259
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,434
Look, nobody...

260
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,808
Not even the top arson
investigators

261
00:11:29,853 --> 00:11:32,056
could figure out how these
fires were started.

262
00:11:32,238 --> 00:11:36,096
Hell, even with my brain, if i didn't
know about neuros,

263
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:37,072
i wouldn't be able
to figure it out.

264
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,001
Your point?

265
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,306
What kind of background
does connor have

266
00:11:39,354 --> 00:11:42,076
that could make him that
much of a specialist?

267
00:11:42,146 --> 00:11:44,521
Someone who can
outsmart even the best?

268
00:11:44,627 --> 00:11:46,732
That's pretty slim, riley?

269
00:11:46,803 --> 00:11:49,720
They don't care how they started
just that they were.

270
00:11:50,481 --> 00:11:52,175
You have something better?

271
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:55,609
I could lie.

272
00:11:57,985 --> 00:11:59,455
I was there with him.

273
00:12:00,537 --> 00:12:03,186
Since i can't testify as
to why i was there...

274
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,656
Why do i have to admit
that i was.

275
00:12:05,773 --> 00:12:08,184
About a half a dozen
cops as witnesses?

276
00:12:09,102 --> 00:12:09,961
My word against theirs?

277
00:12:10,031 --> 00:12:10,996
Enough of this.

278
00:12:11,101 --> 00:12:12,497
I don't need two of
my people in prison.

279
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,449
Just get up there and
answer the questions.

280
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:15,951
And put another nail
into connor's coffin.

281
00:12:16,037 --> 00:12:17,883
Admitting who we are
and what we do is not

282
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:19,554
the only truth here,
people.

283
00:12:19,636 --> 00:12:22,435
The truth is that there is a neuro
out there who did set those fires.

284
00:12:22,518 --> 00:12:25,243
And who stopped setting them the
moment connor was arrested.

285
00:12:25,326 --> 00:12:26,678
Doesn't matter.

286
00:12:26,748 --> 00:12:28,011
We find the person
that did this...

287
00:12:28,054 --> 00:12:29,012
And connor walks.

288
00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:30,013
Let's get to work!

289
00:12:30,065 --> 00:12:33,665
Look, if you guys would only stick to
my pattern, we might find this guy.

290
00:12:33,735 --> 00:12:35,584
Connor already put a dent
in your pattern

291
00:12:35,704 --> 00:12:38,254
the day he and vasco staked
out the samuel's house.

292
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:43,940
We all agree on this:

293
00:12:44,137 --> 00:12:48,260
every target house was two-stories,
painted blue,

294
00:12:48,378 --> 00:12:51,186
all within a mile of an
interstate on ramp.

295
00:12:51,352 --> 00:12:52,038
And all...

296
00:12:52,103 --> 00:12:53,039
Except one...

297
00:12:53,976 --> 00:12:56,106
Have garages
facing back alleys.

298
00:12:56,165 --> 00:12:58,858
If you say "Except for one"
there is no pattern.

299
00:12:58,964 --> 00:13:00,328
Connor played a hunch
and he was right.

300
00:13:00,351 --> 00:13:01,351
Sorry, riley.

301
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:03,339
If we go strictly by
your criteria

302
00:13:03,386 --> 00:13:04,852
we could miss the
next opportunity.

303
00:13:04,915 --> 00:13:05,847
If there is one.

304
00:13:05,962 --> 00:13:06,916
Well i'm sorry,

305
00:13:07,644 --> 00:13:09,914
my database isn't set up
to predict hunches.

306
00:13:09,973 --> 00:13:10,977
Well maybe it should.

307
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:11,976
You're fighting
the clock on this

308
00:13:12,023 --> 00:13:13,578
He goes on trial tomorrow.

309
00:13:13,658 --> 00:13:14,663
They're calling bill cole,

310
00:13:14,704 --> 00:13:16,763
connor's former cell
mate to testify.

311
00:13:17,692 --> 00:13:18,539
With bail denied,

312
00:13:18,602 --> 00:13:20,621
former police officer
and convict, connor king

313
00:13:20,665 --> 00:13:22,174
faces arson and murder
charges today

314
00:13:22,226 --> 00:13:23,826
in day 1 of this
gripping trial.

315
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:27,279
A profile of mr. King, the
man behind the match tonight.

316
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:01,149
Everyone knows connor is
crazy, that's why we love him.

317
00:14:01,232 --> 00:14:03,372
But an arsonist,
i couldn't believe it.

318
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:03,925
And yet...

319
00:14:11,215 --> 00:14:12,156
He's down!

320
00:14:12,478 --> 00:14:13,478
Let's get him!

321
00:14:13,856 --> 00:14:14,856
Take care of this!

322
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:28,362
Thanks!

323
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,749
So much for falling
on your sword.

324
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,968
What the hell did you
think you were doing?

325
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:37,101
Trying to save my ass.

326
00:14:37,137 --> 00:14:40,253
Which i might've if vasco
didn't pull her hero act.

327
00:14:40,324 --> 00:14:42,641
She took two shots
to her shoulder...

328
00:14:42,735 --> 00:14:44,087
To act like a hero.

329
00:14:44,605 --> 00:14:45,969
She'll get over it.

330
00:14:46,064 --> 00:14:50,867
She was trying to protect you, connor
from more than just bullets.

331
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:53,320
How far do you think
you'd get if you got away.

332
00:14:53,407 --> 00:14:55,806
You gonna keep me
after school, boss?

333
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:57,970
I'm trying to help,

334
00:14:58,718 --> 00:14:59,656
what do you
want me to do,

335
00:14:59,748 --> 00:15:01,057
just throw you
to the lions.

336
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,936
I thought you
already did that.

337
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,688
Every man has his
breaking point.

338
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:09,071
I know you.

339
00:15:10,412 --> 00:15:11,741
This isn't yours.

340
00:15:12,929 --> 00:15:14,438
Why'd you run?

341
00:15:17,643 --> 00:15:20,641
Listen to me you
stubborn son of a bitch,
we're trying to help you.

342
00:15:20,696 --> 00:15:22,703
We can't do that if you're
hiding something from us.

343
00:15:22,778 --> 00:15:23,704
Why'd you run?!!

344
00:15:24,921 --> 00:15:26,532
Bill cole's gonna testify.

345
00:15:26,642 --> 00:15:27,642
I know.

346
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:29,755
We tried to keep your past
record out of this...

347
00:15:29,814 --> 00:15:31,766
But you don't know
what he knows.

348
00:15:31,908 --> 00:15:35,260
I read your sheet before
i took you on the team.

349
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:37,230
Tip of the iceberg, pal.

350
00:15:42,182 --> 00:15:43,087
Okay...

351
00:15:45,404 --> 00:15:47,495
Tell me what
i don't know.

352
00:15:47,683 --> 00:15:49,224
Sorry, no can do.

353
00:15:49,318 --> 00:15:51,604
The more i know, the more
i might be able to help.

354
00:15:51,741 --> 00:15:52,858
Ain't gonna happen.

355
00:15:52,978 --> 00:15:54,852
You're willing
to face a murder two rap.

356
00:15:54,929 --> 00:15:57,022
But you won't
tell me about this!!

357
00:15:59,947 --> 00:16:01,603
Unless you're trying
protecting someone.

358
00:16:01,687 --> 00:16:04,728
Hunting down "chip monkeys"
isn't the only thing
worth dying for.

359
00:16:04,793 --> 00:16:06,100
But not facing
the consequences

360
00:16:06,145 --> 00:16:07,228
of bill cole's
testimony is?

361
00:16:07,298 --> 00:16:08,229
Come on!!!

362
00:16:08,978 --> 00:16:11,677
I told you when you brought
me on board this team,

363
00:16:11,792 --> 00:16:14,106
you knew everything about
me you needed to know.

364
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:17,040
You had my word that i would
not jeopardize this team

365
00:16:17,381 --> 00:16:19,067
or, intentionally,
put anyone at risk.

366
00:16:19,978 --> 00:16:21,885
I think i made
good on that.

367
00:16:22,638 --> 00:16:25,014
Anything beyond that
promise is personal.

368
00:16:31,103 --> 00:16:33,761
Bill cole's scheduled
to testify tomorrow.

369
00:16:34,355 --> 00:16:37,548
Nice to know the date
and time of your own execution.

370
00:16:38,807 --> 00:16:41,868
So where are we?

371
00:16:41,979 --> 00:16:43,668
Pretty much
at square one.

372
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,032
Maureen and i
came up dry

373
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:46,561
with everyone left
on our list.

374
00:16:46,608 --> 00:16:49,278
Route truck drivers,
delivery personnel.

375
00:16:49,569 --> 00:16:51,606
Basically every theory
we've been working on.

376
00:16:51,669 --> 00:16:52,669
Nothing.

377
00:16:52,794 --> 00:16:54,250
No one had a hunch?

378
00:16:54,309 --> 00:16:55,520
Shut up, riley.

379
00:17:02,573 --> 00:17:03,573
No.

380
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:05,450
No!!!

381
00:17:06,635 --> 00:17:09,381
I know you're the big boss
and you guys go out

382
00:17:09,451 --> 00:17:11,299
into the field and
grab all the glory

383
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:14,926
but you get to do what you do
because i'm in here, doing what i do.

384
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:15,944
And you know what?

385
00:17:15,991 --> 00:17:17,659
I'm damn good
at what i do!

386
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,787
But you're all willing
to risk connor's ass

387
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:22,976
because you trust
your instincts, your hunches,

388
00:17:23,058 --> 00:17:25,352
more than you do what
i'm telling you.

389
00:17:26,822 --> 00:17:28,454
I'm right about
the pattern,

390
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,654
despite connor's
lucky guess.

391
00:17:30,854 --> 00:17:32,386
Have you stopped to think
that maybe the reason

392
00:17:32,465 --> 00:17:34,688
the samuel's house didn't
fit the pattern

393
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,664
is because connor
did start that fire?

394
00:17:36,698 --> 00:17:37,848
You don't believe that.

395
00:17:39,904 --> 00:17:40,598
No,

396
00:17:42,699 --> 00:17:49,783
but i do believe that if we worked
my theory, we might find out who did.

397
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:56,110
Alright, run it again.

398
00:18:05,889 --> 00:18:06,889
Alright.

399
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,758
Why the guy targets two-story blue
houses is anyone's guess.

400
00:18:10,852 --> 00:18:12,217
He's a psycho.

401
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,452
Maybe he grew up in
a house like that.

402
00:18:14,522 --> 00:18:15,104
Hated his mother.

403
00:18:15,157 --> 00:18:15,827
His father.

404
00:18:15,879 --> 00:18:16,549
The color blue.

405
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:17,714
I don't know.

406
00:18:18,325 --> 00:18:20,854
But why the garages
facing alleys?

407
00:18:20,952 --> 00:18:23,218
Because it gives
him access.

408
00:18:23,326 --> 00:18:26,406
There've been six fires.

409
00:18:26,465 --> 00:18:29,115
And no one's spotted
the fire starter.

410
00:18:29,215 --> 00:18:30,215
Why?

411
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:35,478
Every house has been within
a mile of an interstate.

412
00:18:35,592 --> 00:18:36,592
What does this mean?

413
00:18:37,404 --> 00:18:39,266
The guy's on wheels.

414
00:18:39,342 --> 00:18:41,392
What does he do when
he finds his target?

415
00:18:41,513 --> 00:18:42,877
Park and walk?

416
00:18:43,904 --> 00:18:46,782
Or stash his car somewhere
in the alleys.

417
00:18:46,865 --> 00:18:48,955
Maybe even a
neighboring garage.

418
00:18:49,093 --> 00:18:50,089
It's a long shot.

419
00:18:50,781 --> 00:18:52,181
Do you have
anything better?

420
00:18:54,483 --> 00:18:56,280
We'll have to interface
with the locals,

421
00:18:56,406 --> 00:18:57,456
get out
in the field.

422
00:18:57,531 --> 00:18:58,777
Interview some neighbors.

423
00:18:58,894 --> 00:18:59,778
Let's roll.

424
00:19:00,156 --> 00:19:01,256
You're going to do it?

425
00:19:02,656 --> 00:19:06,820
Like you said, i don't
have any better ideas.

426
00:19:07,717 --> 00:19:08,917
Jane,
can i have a word.

427
00:19:08,968 --> 00:19:09,968
Yeah.

428
00:19:16,535 --> 00:19:19,432
I told you yesterday i didn't
want you committing perjury.

429
00:19:19,532 --> 00:19:20,532
Change your mind?

430
00:19:20,844 --> 00:19:21,844
No.

431
00:19:22,983 --> 00:19:23,901
Then what?

432
00:19:23,968 --> 00:19:26,018
What i have in mind
is a whole lot worse.

433
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:26,900
today, the judge

434
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:28,907
in the invisible man arsonist case
is going to allow testimony

435
00:19:28,982 --> 00:19:31,640
of the criminal
background of connor king.

436
00:19:31,718 --> 00:19:32,465
Bill cole,

437
00:19:32,534 --> 00:19:34,781
a former police officer and
partner of the defendant,

438
00:19:34,862 --> 00:19:36,144
is scheduled to take the stand
this afternoon.

439
00:19:36,238 --> 00:19:37,157
Stay tuned.

440
00:19:37,285 --> 00:19:38,344
Excuse me?

441
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,408
Are you bill cole?

442
00:19:39,468 --> 00:19:40,468
Yeah.

443
00:19:40,844 --> 00:19:42,555
Got a message for you.

444
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:44,764
Someone wants
to talk to you.

445
00:19:44,905 --> 00:19:45,905
Just head back out.

446
00:19:45,969 --> 00:19:48,169
Down the hall, through
the door on the left.

447
00:19:55,656 --> 00:19:57,312
How are you doing?

448
00:19:59,453 --> 00:20:00,942
Against the fence
with her.

449
00:20:02,321 --> 00:20:04,937
You'd be dead before your
hand hit the knob.

450
00:20:05,567 --> 00:20:06,735
What do you want from us?

451
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:08,923
You going to tell me
what this is about?

452
00:20:09,366 --> 00:20:12,110
It's about two people who are going to testify
against a friend of mine.

453
00:20:12,213 --> 00:20:14,011
You still haven't
told us who you are.

454
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:15,735
The man who will
kill you if you do.

455
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:16,673
Right here?

456
00:20:16,692 --> 00:20:18,024
With all these
cops around?

457
00:20:18,172 --> 00:20:19,422
That would be
my problem.

458
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:20,799
Yes, it would be.

459
00:20:21,048 --> 00:20:23,098
And i don't think you'd
take that chance.

460
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,299
Try me.

461
00:20:25,381 --> 00:20:26,828
I'm a federal officer...

462
00:20:31,924 --> 00:20:32,924
Oh, my god.

463
00:20:37,286 --> 00:20:38,862
So this is how it is.

464
00:20:39,362 --> 00:20:42,391
The "big man," connor king
doesn't take any chances.

465
00:20:44,861 --> 00:20:47,910
Can't risk anyone finding out that he and
i did time together

466
00:20:50,469 --> 00:20:51,757
arson charges.

467
00:20:53,657 --> 00:20:54,657
Alright pal,

468
00:20:55,533 --> 00:20:58,133
let's see how much of
a risk you're willing to take.

469
00:21:06,221 --> 00:21:08,031
What are these
photographs?

470
00:21:10,782 --> 00:21:12,642
They're our
wedding pictures.

471
00:21:17,722 --> 00:21:19,372
The woman in the
photograph is...

472
00:21:19,533 --> 00:21:20,158
Lucy.

473
00:21:20,203 --> 00:21:21,159
She's...

474
00:21:22,097 --> 00:21:23,484
She was my wife.

475
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,208
I understand the morning
of the fire

476
00:21:26,471 --> 00:21:28,930
you left for work
at around 8:00 am.

477
00:21:29,908 --> 00:21:30,908
Yes, sir.

478
00:21:30,972 --> 00:21:33,822
And lucy, was it typical
for her to be home at that hour?

479
00:21:34,235 --> 00:21:35,096
Yes.

480
00:21:35,286 --> 00:21:36,282
Lucy worked part time.

481
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:38,933
She didn't usually leave
the house until around noon.

482
00:21:39,222 --> 00:21:41,272
You were at work when
the police arrived.

483
00:21:41,498 --> 00:21:42,185
Yes.

484
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,186
Tell us about that.

485
00:21:44,372 --> 00:21:47,138
Two detectives showed
up at my office.

486
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,436
They told me there'd
been a fire...

487
00:21:50,502 --> 00:21:51,687
They said that someone...

488
00:21:52,623 --> 00:21:54,173
That someone had
been killed...

489
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,241
...They asked me
to come down

490
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:06,758
to the medical examiner's office
to make an identification.

491
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:07,867
And did you do that?

492
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:09,430
Yes.

493
00:22:11,569 --> 00:22:12,463
It was lucy.

494
00:22:15,117 --> 00:22:17,367
The prosecution calls
bill cole to the stand.

495
00:22:18,026 --> 00:22:19,838
Mr. Cole,
would you tell the court

496
00:22:19,944 --> 00:22:21,742
how you
know the defendant, connor king.

497
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:38,023
I refuse to answer.

498
00:22:42,053 --> 00:22:43,363
Excuse me?

499
00:22:43,515 --> 00:22:46,549
I refuse to answer on the grounds
that it could incriminate me.

500
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:50,646
You and mr. King served time
in prison for crimes committed

501
00:22:50,693 --> 00:22:53,775
while you were employed
by the metropolitan police.

502
00:22:53,869 --> 00:22:54,792
Isn't that so?

503
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,262
Objection, leading
the witness.

504
00:22:56,321 --> 00:22:57,097
Your honor.

505
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,390
This witness has been
granted immunity.

506
00:22:59,532 --> 00:23:01,825
The fifth amendment
doesn't apply.

507
00:23:01,884 --> 00:23:02,896
Mr. Cole.

508
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:06,628
The court directs you to
answer the questions

509
00:23:06,683 --> 00:23:08,483
put to you by
the district attorney.

510
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:10,370
Mr. Cole.

511
00:23:11,244 --> 00:23:13,894
Have you ever been arrested
or served time in prison?

512
00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:16,951
Mr. Cole...

513
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:21,820
I refuse to answer on
the grounds
that it might incriminate me.

514
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:22,705
Your honor.

515
00:23:22,964 --> 00:23:25,952
Mr. Cole, the court
will not be lenient

516
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:28,481
if you continue
to refuse to answer.

517
00:23:28,552 --> 00:23:30,210
Answer the question.

518
00:23:33,305 --> 00:23:36,455
I refuse to answer on
the grounds
that it might incriminate me.

519
00:23:38,615 --> 00:23:42,830
Alright, court finds
bill cole in contempt.

520
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:43,803
Bailiff!

521
00:23:56,676 --> 00:23:57,676
How'd it go?

522
00:23:57,752 --> 00:23:58,680
We bought some time.

523
00:23:58,991 --> 00:24:00,091
I don't know how much.

524
00:24:01,363 --> 00:24:03,723
Well, we've got something.

525
00:24:03,802 --> 00:24:05,688
Genius boy strikes again.

526
00:24:05,739 --> 00:24:07,738
At least two neighbors
to the previous arsons

527
00:24:07,805 --> 00:24:09,796
reported that their garage
locks had been broken.

528
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:12,771
The cops said they found oil stains
on the cement in both garages.

529
00:24:12,877 --> 00:24:14,995
Not so unusual
for a garage.

530
00:24:16,112 --> 00:24:18,994
Except one of the residents
doesn't own a car.

531
00:24:19,123 --> 00:24:22,796
And in the other garage, a one-car
garage with the car in it...

532
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,831
The oil stain was
off to the side.

533
00:24:24,925 --> 00:24:26,513
And this tells us...?

534
00:24:26,689 --> 00:24:29,453
I'm having samples run
on the oil stains to confirm...

535
00:24:29,571 --> 00:24:31,051
But from everything
we can tell,

536
00:24:31,215 --> 00:24:32,850
the quantity of
oil and the location

537
00:24:33,838 --> 00:24:36,531
is that our boy shows up to do
his dirty work on a motorcycle.

538
00:24:36,616 --> 00:24:38,072
It does fit.

539
00:24:38,178 --> 00:24:39,507
Doesn't give us a name

540
00:24:39,613 --> 00:24:41,555
but it gets us
a step closer.

541
00:24:42,864 --> 00:24:44,507
Even if you're right...

542
00:24:44,741 --> 00:24:46,389
I'm not sure this
actually helps.

543
00:24:46,507 --> 00:24:48,095
Hell, it's more than
we had 24 hours ago.

544
00:24:48,177 --> 00:24:49,694
We're forgetting something...

545
00:24:50,624 --> 00:24:52,519
Connor rides a motorcycle.

546
00:24:58,061 --> 00:24:59,866
the quality of
the material is quite good

547
00:24:59,966 --> 00:25:03,016
as are the magnification
properties.

548
00:25:07,179 --> 00:25:09,978
Your honor, the defense has stipulated
that these towels

549
00:25:10,073 --> 00:25:11,915
are the same brand
and fiber content

550
00:25:11,974 --> 00:25:13,729
as those found in
the samuel's home.

551
00:25:14,232 --> 00:25:14,914
Noted.

552
00:25:14,961 --> 00:25:16,055
You may proceed.

553
00:25:16,267 --> 00:25:17,271
Doctor.

554
00:25:17,711 --> 00:25:19,061
Turn on
that light, please.

555
00:25:21,462 --> 00:25:24,111
I'm sure many of us rember
playing with sunlight

556
00:25:24,182 --> 00:25:26,834
and magnification
as children.

557
00:25:28,263 --> 00:25:30,397
We'll have to imagine
that this is sunlight,

558
00:25:30,451 --> 00:25:32,548
coming into the courtroom
from the outside.

559
00:25:33,544 --> 00:25:36,582
The degree of magnification
would affect

560
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:38,719
the amount of time
this would take.

561
00:25:39,331 --> 00:25:42,518
As i said, this sample
is quite good.

562
00:25:51,412 --> 00:25:52,358
Doctor, is it possible

563
00:25:52,424 --> 00:25:54,609
that a magnifying device
that you're holding,

564
00:25:55,612 --> 00:25:57,111
could that have started
the fire

565
00:25:57,184 --> 00:25:58,860
in the samuel's house
or any of the other fires?

566
00:25:58,948 --> 00:25:59,486
Objection.

567
00:25:59,548 --> 00:26:00,487
Speculative.

568
00:26:00,889 --> 00:26:03,935
Whether the device
started the fire or not
is not an issue.

569
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,795
To date, there's been
no evidence entered

570
00:26:05,841 --> 00:26:08,978
to indicate that anyone knows
how these fires started.

571
00:26:09,731 --> 00:26:10,707
Sustained.

572
00:26:10,837 --> 00:26:12,283
No further questions.

573
00:26:15,118 --> 00:26:18,132
Doctor, in a typical
house fire, would solid glass

574
00:26:18,215 --> 00:26:20,967
be completely
consumed by heat or flame?

575
00:26:21,083 --> 00:26:22,214
Damaged, perhaps.

576
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,437
Completely consumed, unlikely.

577
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:27,248
So if a device had been
used in the fire.

578
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:30,133
Subsequent investigation would
have turned up all

579
00:26:30,274 --> 00:26:32,615
or part of those
magnifying glasses.

580
00:26:32,662 --> 00:26:34,273
That would be true.

581
00:26:34,496 --> 00:26:36,354
If they were
made of glass.

582
00:26:36,425 --> 00:26:39,224
It wouldn't take much more
than a match flame

583
00:26:39,318 --> 00:26:43,612
to turn these
into useless ash.

584
00:26:44,658 --> 00:26:47,573
These are made
of spun sugar, highly refined.

585
00:26:49,178 --> 00:26:50,984
No further questions,
your honor.

586
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:55,863
Mr. Beetle, would you tell the court
where you're employed?

587
00:26:58,904 --> 00:27:02,750
I own and manage a storage facility
just outside of cranston.

588
00:27:02,853 --> 00:27:06,477
This is a facility where
anyone can rent space
to store their belongings.

589
00:27:06,554 --> 00:27:07,478
Precisely.

590
00:27:07,538 --> 00:27:09,602
Do you recall accompanying
my investigators

591
00:27:09,683 --> 00:27:12,459
to storage unit 14d,
two weeks ago friday?

592
00:27:12,538 --> 00:27:13,538
Yes, i do.

593
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:15,411
Were you with them when
they entered the unit?

594
00:27:15,517 --> 00:27:18,850
They needed my permission
and my master key
to gain entry.

595
00:27:18,944 --> 00:27:20,837
Among the contents
in the unit,

596
00:27:21,732 --> 00:27:24,813
did you come across this
box of magnifying devices.

597
00:27:25,155 --> 00:27:27,531
In fact, we found
about a dozen boxes.

598
00:27:27,707 --> 00:27:29,137
That is one of them.

599
00:27:30,854 --> 00:27:32,583
Do you recognize
this form?

600
00:27:36,853 --> 00:27:39,617
This is one of our standard,
long-term contracts.

601
00:27:39,915 --> 00:27:41,873
And that particular
contract...

602
00:27:41,955 --> 00:27:43,531
How long has
the signatory

603
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:46,178
leased space in
storage unit 14d?

604
00:27:47,213 --> 00:27:49,753
Two years, three months
and fourteen days.

605
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,869
Would you read the name of the person
to whom the unit was rented?

606
00:27:55,293 --> 00:27:56,422
Connor king.

607
00:27:58,504 --> 00:27:59,893
This is a load of crap!

608
00:27:59,952 --> 00:28:00,905
Order!!

609
00:28:02,269 --> 00:28:04,868
This court will take
a half hour recess.

610
00:28:04,926 --> 00:28:05,803
You know about this?

611
00:28:05,856 --> 00:28:06,675
Of course not.

612
00:28:06,739 --> 00:28:07,676
Do something!

613
00:28:07,991 --> 00:28:09,241
I'm doing the best i can!

614
00:28:09,738 --> 00:28:10,738
Is this your best?

615
00:28:11,426 --> 00:28:12,426
Is this your best?!

616
00:28:22,113 --> 00:28:24,702
Remember this face,
beetle, rember it!!!

617
00:28:27,855 --> 00:28:28,819
I don't believe it,

618
00:28:28,913 --> 00:28:31,191
connor entered the samuel's
house against orders.

619
00:28:31,471 --> 00:28:34,104
So when has connor done
anything by the books.

620
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:36,539
Thought he saw something
going on,

621
00:28:36,716 --> 00:28:38,526
thought he had a window
of opportunity

622
00:28:38,597 --> 00:28:40,595
to get the neuro
and to get out.

623
00:28:40,778 --> 00:28:43,382
But, from inside the suv,
you couldn't see

624
00:28:43,465 --> 00:28:45,015
what he was
doing in the house.

625
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:48,369
All you can say is that you saw
connor enter the house,

626
00:28:48,557 --> 00:28:50,504
saw the fire begin
and saw him running out.

627
00:28:50,598 --> 00:28:52,092
What the hell is this?

628
00:28:52,209 --> 00:28:54,503
It sounds like you guys
really think he's guilty!

629
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:57,153
Nice to know where
your friends stand
when things get tough.

630
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,031
It's not about
what we think.

631
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:01,940
You just answered the questions
the d.A. Will put to you.

632
00:29:02,467 --> 00:29:04,917
And by the way, bill cole
may not be the only one

633
00:29:05,028 --> 00:29:06,678
who could testify
against connor.

634
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,790
Why don't you tell them
what you were telling me.

635
00:29:17,592 --> 00:29:18,592
What?

636
00:29:18,716 --> 00:29:20,166
What we were
talking about...

637
00:29:21,465 --> 00:29:22,465
Connor's hunch.

638
00:29:26,152 --> 00:29:28,151
I was thinking about what
riley said the other day

639
00:29:28,261 --> 00:29:30,052
about things being
simple and logical.

640
00:29:33,466 --> 00:29:36,515
We assume that either
connor had to be right

641
00:29:36,592 --> 00:29:37,844
or riley had
to be right.

642
00:29:38,185 --> 00:29:40,025
But given what we learned

643
00:29:40,126 --> 00:29:41,926
about the oil stains
in the garages...

644
00:29:42,339 --> 00:29:43,389
I started thinking...

645
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:45,540
What if they
were both right?

646
00:29:46,113 --> 00:29:46,854
If?

647
00:29:47,843 --> 00:29:51,324
Let's assume riley is
right about the pattern...

648
00:29:51,464 --> 00:29:53,958
About the importance
of the garages.

649
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:56,276
The samuel's house didn't
have an alley-facing garage

650
00:29:56,338 --> 00:29:57,467
and didn't
fit the pattern.

651
00:29:57,503 --> 00:29:59,916
Maybe we're not dealing
with a pyromaniac at all.

652
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:03,242
Maybe we're dealing with
someone who has a motive.

653
00:30:03,325 --> 00:30:04,403
Think about it,

654
00:30:04,454 --> 00:30:07,171
lucy lived in
a two-storey blue house.

655
00:30:07,717 --> 00:30:08,717
So...

656
00:30:08,778 --> 00:30:10,978
The neuro wants lucy
dead, or maybe scott...

657
00:30:11,699 --> 00:30:16,157
To cover his tracks, he torches five other
blue, two-story houses.

658
00:30:16,216 --> 00:30:17,415
To avoid the risk
of being seen,

659
00:30:17,468 --> 00:30:19,466
he looks for houses
with alley facing garages.

660
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,790
He doesn't realize there's
a crazy genius named riley

661
00:30:22,843 --> 00:30:24,466
who sees that as part
of the pattern.

662
00:30:24,554 --> 00:30:26,567
By the time he gets
to the samuel's place,

663
00:30:26,824 --> 00:30:30,341
he thinks it's going to look like just another
whack job, blue house arson.

664
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:32,404
You got that background
on the samuel house yet?

665
00:30:32,459 --> 00:30:33,153
I'll find something,

666
00:30:33,211 --> 00:30:34,780
i just need a little
bit more time.

667
00:30:34,835 --> 00:30:36,731
Something connor doesn't
have a lot of.

668
00:30:43,093 --> 00:30:44,093
If i was you,

669
00:30:44,155 --> 00:30:45,652
i could break every bone
in my body,

670
00:30:45,722 --> 00:30:46,966
slip through these
air holes

671
00:30:47,074 --> 00:30:48,617
and walk out of here
good as new.

672
00:30:50,156 --> 00:30:51,238
If you were me,

673
00:30:52,297 --> 00:30:55,237
you'd look a whole lot better
in that orange jumpsuit.

674
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:59,260
Looks pretty grim, huh?

675
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:03,457
We're working
on something.

676
00:31:03,833 --> 00:31:05,880
Don't know yet
if it'll pay off.

677
00:31:06,338 --> 00:31:08,067
It might help if you
told me what happened.

678
00:31:08,155 --> 00:31:10,349
You starting to
think i'm guilty?

679
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:14,786
That's not what i said.

680
00:31:15,715 --> 00:31:17,127
It's just that
the more we know...

681
00:31:17,268 --> 00:31:19,855
You know what i want
you to know, darlin'.

682
00:31:21,855 --> 00:31:23,019
That's it.

683
00:31:26,077 --> 00:31:28,130
Yeah, it's going
to have to be.

684
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,459
Yeah.

685
00:31:34,776 --> 00:31:35,638
I'm on my way.

686
00:31:39,558 --> 00:31:40,652
I gotta go.

687
00:31:42,078 --> 00:31:42,863
Vasco.

688
00:31:47,267 --> 00:31:48,267
Thanks.

689
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,246
See you in court.

690
00:31:58,143 --> 00:31:59,143
What've you got?

691
00:31:59,765 --> 00:32:03,540
I found the original computer file
of connor's storage locker rental.

692
00:32:03,952 --> 00:32:04,952
So it's legitimate.

693
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:05,766
No.

694
00:32:05,794 --> 00:32:06,684
What?

695
00:32:06,764 --> 00:32:08,950
According to the receipt,
connor's rented this unit

696
00:32:09,005 --> 00:32:10,351
for a little
over two years.

697
00:32:11,016 --> 00:32:12,752
But that's the date
on the contract.

698
00:32:12,804 --> 00:32:14,018
Not the date
on the file.

699
00:32:14,893 --> 00:32:17,143
The date on the file is
only three weeks old.

700
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:19,069
Maybe it's not
the original version.

701
00:32:19,267 --> 00:32:20,917
If someone saved
a duplicate copy

702
00:32:21,003 --> 00:32:22,753
wouldn't it have
a more recent date?

703
00:32:22,826 --> 00:32:23,768
It would.

704
00:32:24,449 --> 00:32:27,260
But every file's embedded
with a creation date.

705
00:32:27,827 --> 00:32:30,262
Doesn't matter how
often it's modified.

706
00:32:30,578 --> 00:32:33,402
This file didn't
exist last month.

707
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,069
Then someone is
setting him up.

708
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,140
Here's the kicker.

709
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,827
I traced the computer
that created it.

710
00:32:38,908 --> 00:32:40,190
The d.A.'S office.

711
00:32:40,268 --> 00:32:41,613
Richard stanley.

712
00:32:41,836 --> 00:32:43,459
Connor's attorney.

713
00:32:43,579 --> 00:32:45,207
What?!

714
00:32:45,383 --> 00:32:46,412
Why?

715
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,275
That doesn't
make any sense.

716
00:32:48,331 --> 00:32:49,331
Yes, it does.

717
00:32:52,579 --> 00:32:53,393
Don't give me that!!

718
00:32:53,457 --> 00:32:55,244
Who do you think
you're talking to?!!

719
00:32:55,374 --> 00:32:57,962
This has got your paw
prints all over it.

720
00:32:58,019 --> 00:32:59,643
Richard stanley works
for you and like most

721
00:32:59,668 --> 00:33:00,643
of the people who
work for you...

722
00:33:00,691 --> 00:33:01,644
He follows orders.

723
00:33:01,761 --> 00:33:04,396
Setting connor up for that storage locker
rental was your idea.

724
00:33:04,514 --> 00:33:05,767
You're a team
leader, mcbride.

725
00:33:05,805 --> 00:33:07,268
You're not the
commander-in-chief.

726
00:33:07,323 --> 00:33:08,269
I protect my people.

727
00:33:09,334 --> 00:33:11,757
Even if it's from the
commander-in-chief.

728
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:14,062
You don't have
the big picture.

729
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:16,828
I've heard that
story before.

730
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:19,048
Sometimes the "little
people" have to be sacrificed

731
00:33:19,157 --> 00:33:20,733
for the greater
cause, is that it?

732
00:33:20,803 --> 00:33:23,497
I don't see the greater
cause here, sir?

733
00:33:23,544 --> 00:33:25,943
Unless it's
protecting your ass.

734
00:33:26,402 --> 00:33:27,461
I don't like your tone.

735
00:33:27,531 --> 00:33:28,801
You're not supposed to.

736
00:33:28,859 --> 00:33:30,730
King's a liability
to the team.

737
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,341
And to the work we do.

738
00:33:32,486 --> 00:33:33,486
I made a decision.

739
00:33:34,082 --> 00:33:37,555
It was too late to make things "go away"
as you'd hoped we could.

740
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:39,849
If king goes away
for this now,

741
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:42,566
the rest of our problems
will go away with him.

742
00:33:43,483 --> 00:33:44,485
Sir...

743
00:33:45,344 --> 00:33:47,696
I'm not prepared
to let that happen.

744
00:33:54,201 --> 00:33:56,106
You're the field
op, mcbride.

745
00:33:56,112 --> 00:33:58,014
In battle,
it's your call.

746
00:33:58,111 --> 00:33:59,649
Policy is mine.

747
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:02,048
And policy extends beyond
personal feelings and loyalty.

748
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:04,142
You know that
as well as i do.

749
00:34:06,049 --> 00:34:08,111
And you might need to give
it some serious thought

750
00:34:08,196 --> 00:34:10,607
before you do anything
you'll regret.

751
00:34:18,111 --> 00:34:22,963
Richard,
here's the new deal.

752
00:34:25,609 --> 00:34:28,679
If i find that you do anything
to sabbotage connor's chances

753
00:34:28,797 --> 00:34:30,022
to get out of this.

754
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:32,175
If i don't see that you're
doing everything in your power

755
00:34:32,245 --> 00:34:35,574
to provide the best defense,
i want you to remember this:

756
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:40,324
the government spent a lot of money
traing me I'm very good at what i do.

757
00:34:40,743 --> 00:34:42,236
I can approach
a man from 100 metres

758
00:34:42,296 --> 00:34:43,787
and he'll never
hear me coming.

759
00:34:44,883 --> 00:34:46,377
I'll let you decide.

760
00:34:46,765 --> 00:34:49,548
Do you want to spend every
day for the rest of your life

761
00:34:49,642 --> 00:34:51,994
looking over
your shoulder, waiting...

762
00:34:56,925 --> 00:34:57,925
Let's go.

763
00:35:14,971 --> 00:35:19,687
Well, if that's not a motive for murder,
i don't know what is.

764
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:38,790
Everything's in place.

765
00:35:38,862 --> 00:35:40,742
Stanley has his
marching orders.

766
00:35:40,799 --> 00:35:42,295
We've got the new witness.

767
00:35:42,365 --> 00:35:43,989
Crowd control?

768
00:35:44,051 --> 00:35:45,674
The judge has agreed
to clear the courtroom

769
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:46,989
and hear this
outside the jury.

770
00:35:47,024 --> 00:35:47,988
So she finds if
it admissible...

771
00:35:48,059 --> 00:35:49,611
Let's hope it doesn't
get that far.

772
00:35:49,682 --> 00:35:51,799
Let's hope it doesn't
get too hot to handle.

773
00:35:51,882 --> 00:35:53,350
This court is
now in session.

774
00:35:56,238 --> 00:35:58,238
Would you state your
name for the court?

775
00:35:59,113 --> 00:36:00,373
Ellen drake.

776
00:36:03,927 --> 00:36:04,927
Miss drake...

777
00:36:05,365 --> 00:36:08,399
It is "miss", isn't it?

778
00:36:08,738 --> 00:36:09,736
Yes.

779
00:36:09,811 --> 00:36:11,887
Are you familiar with
the blue ridge motel?

780
00:36:12,916 --> 00:36:13,925
I know the name,
i think...

781
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:16,076
Have you ever been to
the blue ridge motel?

782
00:36:16,987 --> 00:36:18,289
I've driven past it.

783
00:36:18,363 --> 00:36:20,794
But you've never actually
been on the premises?

784
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:21,990
No.

785
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:24,535
Your honor,
may i approach?

786
00:36:33,479 --> 00:36:35,737
Would you look
at these photographs.

787
00:36:42,654 --> 00:36:45,489
Would you agree that those
are photographs of you?

788
00:36:49,085 --> 00:36:49,988
Yes.

789
00:36:50,488 --> 00:36:52,767
What would you say if i told
you that those photos

790
00:36:52,861 --> 00:36:55,143
were taken from a surveillance
camera located

791
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,789
in the lobby of
the blue ridge motel?

792
00:36:59,915 --> 00:37:02,962
And do you see the time
stamps on those photographs?

793
00:37:08,864 --> 00:37:09,491
Yes.

794
00:37:09,572 --> 00:37:10,990
They date back at least
a year, don't they?

795
00:37:11,047 --> 00:37:11,677
Yes.

796
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,978
I expect that the
reason you perjured yourself

797
00:37:14,058 --> 00:37:17,115
in this courtroom is
because you were trying
to protect someone.

798
00:37:17,187 --> 00:37:18,516
Is it possible that
you lied

799
00:37:19,365 --> 00:37:21,719
because on the dates in
question at the blue
ridge motel,

800
00:37:21,805 --> 00:37:23,420
you were there
with a married man?

801
00:37:28,862 --> 00:37:29,839
Yes.

802
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:31,715
Mr. Samuel's...

803
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,714
On the dates those
photographs were taken,

804
00:37:33,771 --> 00:37:36,165
were you at the blue ridge
motel with miss drake?

805
00:37:39,026 --> 00:37:43,498
I should inform you, those
photographs are enlargements.

806
00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:46,729
The originals show the entire
office area.

807
00:37:53,869 --> 00:37:55,177
Let me ask you again...

808
00:37:56,215 --> 00:38:00,010
On the date in question,
were you at the blue
ridge motel

809
00:38:00,081 --> 00:38:01,033
with miss drake?

810
00:38:05,715 --> 00:38:06,713
Yes.

811
00:38:06,965 --> 00:38:09,363
Would it be reasonable to say
for the better part of a year,

812
00:38:09,438 --> 00:38:11,864
you had been conducting
an affair with miss drake.

813
00:38:13,926 --> 00:38:14,861
Your honor...

814
00:38:14,919 --> 00:38:16,484
Answer the question.

815
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:22,018
We're in love.

816
00:38:23,136 --> 00:38:24,735
How very nice for you.

817
00:38:26,174 --> 00:38:27,782
Do you own
a motorcycle?

818
00:38:29,738 --> 00:38:30,538
Yes.

819
00:38:30,668 --> 00:38:32,488
It's a late model
torque speedster?

820
00:38:34,052 --> 00:38:35,052
Yes.

821
00:38:35,237 --> 00:38:37,173
You should have it
checked for oil leaks.

822
00:38:37,219 --> 00:38:39,624
Riding a motorcycle can
be potentially dangerous?

823
00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:41,682
I suppose.

824
00:38:41,811 --> 00:38:42,614
I'm curious...

825
00:38:42,658 --> 00:38:44,115
Your wife, lucy,
did she ride?

826
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,550
No.

827
00:38:45,692 --> 00:38:49,597
But you had some reason
to be concerned
for her health or welfare.

828
00:38:49,677 --> 00:38:50,291
No.

829
00:38:50,362 --> 00:38:52,051
Why then did you take out
a half a million dollar

830
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:55,392
life insurance policy in her name
two weeks before she died.

831
00:38:55,498 --> 00:38:57,980
If anyone in the family
was high risk,

832
00:38:58,062 --> 00:38:59,791
it would be you,
mr. Samuel's.

833
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:00,873
I thought that...

834
00:39:01,814 --> 00:39:04,002
If you notice the time stamp
on one of the photographs,

835
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:07,009
november 18th,
the night before the fire.

836
00:39:07,691 --> 00:39:10,020
Let me ask you something,
mr. Samuel's.

837
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,056
You claim to be in
love with miss drake.

838
00:39:12,105 --> 00:39:13,140
Objection.

839
00:39:13,458 --> 00:39:14,752
Overruled.

840
00:39:14,881 --> 00:39:17,386
You meet for an amorous
evening the night before

841
00:39:17,442 --> 00:39:19,480
your wife dies
in the fire.

842
00:39:19,568 --> 00:39:22,065
Two weeks earlier, you
take out an insurance policy

843
00:39:22,132 --> 00:39:24,438
for half million dollars
in her name.

844
00:39:24,508 --> 00:39:25,193
Objection.

845
00:39:25,261 --> 00:39:26,708
Overruled.

846
00:39:26,802 --> 00:39:28,307
Are you psychic
mr. Samuel's...

847
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,628
Or do things just have a
way of working out for you?

848
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,256
Your honor!

849
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:34,241
You set the fire that killed
your wife, didn't you?

850
00:39:34,312 --> 00:39:34,878
No!

851
00:39:34,947 --> 00:39:37,253
In fact, you set all
the fires hoping to cover up

852
00:39:37,323 --> 00:39:39,887
what you did,
isn't that true, mr. Samuel's?

853
00:39:49,531 --> 00:39:50,660
Richard, don't!

854
00:39:50,813 --> 00:39:52,283
The hell with you!

855
00:40:26,134 --> 00:40:28,243
Case closed
you son of a bitch.

856
00:41:05,031 --> 00:41:08,595
Sometimes you have to lose
something to gain something.

857
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:11,330
This time, we almost
lost connor.

858
00:41:13,147 --> 00:41:16,106
I suppose what i've gained
is the realization that,

859
00:41:16,149 --> 00:41:20,846
as much as i try to avoid it,
we are a team.

860
00:41:38,333 --> 00:41:42,391
And when push comes
to shove
we stand beside each other.

861
00:41:44,398 --> 00:41:46,721
Some of us might even
like each other.

862
00:41:49,088 --> 00:41:49,771
What's this?

863
00:41:49,826 --> 00:41:50,772
No champagne?

864
00:41:52,508 --> 00:41:54,037
He is cute, isn't he?

865
00:41:54,963 --> 00:41:58,690
Warm bottled water and
a briefing in 10 minutes.

866
00:42:00,273 --> 00:42:01,273
Welcome back!

867
00:42:01,399 --> 00:42:02,399
Thanks.

868
00:42:05,712 --> 00:42:07,689
Hell, this was easy time.

869
00:42:08,462 --> 00:42:09,462
Maybe for you.

870
00:42:10,399 --> 00:42:12,676
I had to teach
these guys logic.

871
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:19,650
Welcome back.

872
00:42:19,718 --> 00:42:20,651
How's stanley?

873
00:42:20,712 --> 00:42:21,587
Nothing major.

874
00:42:21,659 --> 00:42:24,082
Vasco did a pretty good
job of saving his hide.

875
00:42:24,176 --> 00:42:28,365
You ask me, he'd do a damn
good impersonation
of a crispy critter.

876
00:42:30,164 --> 00:42:31,373
Glad to have you back.

877
00:42:33,649 --> 00:42:35,975
Well, that's so easy
to say, darlin'.

878
00:42:36,081 --> 00:42:40,918
- Actions speak a whole lot louder than words,
- Oh yeah, he's back.

879
00:42:41,712 --> 00:42:43,294
