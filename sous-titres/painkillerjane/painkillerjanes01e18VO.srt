1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,093
My name is Jane Vasco.

2
00:00:01,149 --> 00:00:02,455
I could use you on my team.

3
00:00:02,568 --> 00:00:06,117
I work for a secret government
agency that hunts Neuros.

4
00:00:06,164 --> 00:00:09,505
People who can do dangerous
things with their minds.

5
00:00:10,262 --> 00:00:11,750
On my first assignment...

6
00:00:11,788 --> 00:00:13,865
something a little weird happened,

7
00:00:14,005 --> 00:00:16,899
okay, something really weird.

8
00:00:17,495 --> 00:00:20,408
Until I get some answers
I'm getting on with my life,

9
00:00:20,763 --> 00:00:22,139
doing my job...

10
00:00:22,244 --> 00:00:24,167
stocking up on aspirin...

11
00:00:24,181 --> 00:00:26,843
because I gotta tell ya,

12
00:00:27,592 --> 00:00:29,421
pain's a bitch!

13
00:00:33,894 --> 00:00:36,558
Well, I guess I'll see you
all in a couple of weeks.

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,146
Where you headed, Doc?

15
00:00:38,241 --> 00:00:42,566
Medical convention, seminars,
training. My usual vacation.

16
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,552
Lot of trout running
at the seminar, Doc?

17
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:51,007
- Well, I thought if I had the time...
- You casting or using flies?

18
00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:54,637
I'm afraid I haven't perfected the
use of flies. Not that I haven't tried.

19
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:57,979
- Seth, you fish?
- I've caught a few in my time, yes.

20
00:00:58,005 --> 00:01:00,351
- Flies?
- Fish.

21
00:01:00,505 --> 00:01:02,172
Why? Does that surprise you?

22
00:01:02,454 --> 00:01:06,613
Well, you just don't strike me
as the outdoorsy type.

23
00:01:06,962 --> 00:01:09,011
Perhaps you don't know me
as well as you think you do.

24
00:01:09,104 --> 00:01:11,687
- Perhaps I don't.
- Well, enjoy your time off.

25
00:01:12,418 --> 00:01:16,221
That's my prescription. You
all need it. Badly, I might add.

26
00:01:19,451 --> 00:01:21,671
Always a barrel of laughs that one.

27
00:01:21,777 --> 00:01:23,612
Looking forward to Maui?

28
00:01:24,063 --> 00:01:25,726
Still haven't told us
who you're going with?

29
00:01:25,767 --> 00:01:28,069
Why do you assume I'm going with anyone?

30
00:01:28,587 --> 00:01:30,656
Who goes to Maui alone?

31
00:01:30,769 --> 00:01:33,038
Unless, of course, you're
meeting someone there.

32
00:01:33,182 --> 00:01:34,914
You're going to be in
St. Thomas with Brian.

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,923
I don't think you should be
concerned about what I'm up to.

34
00:01:36,981 --> 00:01:38,269
What are you looking at?

35
00:01:38,283 --> 00:01:40,788
Actually, I'll be at home reading.

36
00:01:40,905 --> 00:01:42,475
Got stood up, darlin'?

37
00:01:42,725 --> 00:01:45,884
No, Brian got handed
another assignment.

38
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:48,032
He's heading off to Houston
in the morning.

39
00:01:48,073 --> 00:01:50,453
And who goes to
St. Thomas alone, right?

40
00:01:50,518 --> 00:01:52,242
Yeah, something like that.

41
00:01:52,311 --> 00:01:54,289
I can always use
some time to myself, right?

42
00:01:54,409 --> 00:01:58,843
Catch up on my reading,
watch some old movies...

43
00:01:59,717 --> 00:02:00,728
Houston.

44
00:02:00,824 --> 00:02:03,858
I'm going to be here the whole
two weeks, workin' on the bike.

45
00:02:03,986 --> 00:02:09,206
I could always use a hand, you know,
cleaning plugs, applying torque...

46
00:02:10,061 --> 00:02:11,953
Done.
Everything's backed up.

47
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:14,572
I've got redundant image
files stored offsite.

48
00:02:14,848 --> 00:02:16,997
Security's secure.

49
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,757
Gentlemen and neighbors,
I bid you farewell.

50
00:02:21,066 --> 00:02:23,837
I am out of here.
Comic book convention?

51
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,746
If only you knew.

52
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,935
- Breach?
- No, it couldn't be!

53
00:02:35,315 --> 00:02:38,764
It's Simon Connolly.
I'm picking up his ankle bracelet.

54
00:02:42,566 --> 00:02:46,978
If you leave we'll know
about it, don't leave.

55
00:02:48,386 --> 00:02:50,094
He's left the house
and is on the move.

56
00:02:50,272 --> 00:02:52,192
What do we care,
the old bastard's chipped.

57
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,095
Wait, not yet.

58
00:02:56,812 --> 00:03:00,767
That chip gun,
you put a blank in it.

59
00:03:03,447 --> 00:03:05,598
Don't read too much into it.

60
00:03:06,027 --> 00:03:08,881
You take one step
off these premises,

61
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,401
I will kill you.

62
00:03:11,436 --> 00:03:14,664
- Any idea where he's headed?
- He's moving too fast to be on foot.

63
00:03:14,788 --> 00:03:16,734
We'll have to triangulate.
Connor, you'll ride with me.

64
00:03:16,858 --> 00:03:19,936
You'll go solo.
Don't lose him, Riley. Let's roll.

65
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:25,366
Ok, he's moving out of the city.
I've got him on highway 52, heading East.

66
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:28,554
Don't know whether he'll stick to that
or pick up 4 West in another two miles.

67
00:03:28,616 --> 00:03:31,510
- I can cover on the West fork.
- Yeah, you can.

68
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,778
Ok, take the turnoff on 15
and start South.

69
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:36,155
If he does take 4 you
can get ahead of him.

70
00:03:37,226 --> 00:03:39,519
I will pick him up on 52
if he keeps on course.

71
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:43,218
Jane. He has turned off on 4 West
and you're in point position.

72
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,214
Copy that.

73
00:03:44,306 --> 00:03:47,587
Andre, you can pick up I-12
and cut over. Five miles ahead.

74
00:03:47,947 --> 00:03:49,950
I thought that S.O.B. was dying.

75
00:03:49,985 --> 00:03:52,907
Yeah, well, he's not doing a very
good job of it at the moment, is he?

76
00:03:54,711 --> 00:03:57,860
Jane, I've got him turning
off 4 at Seminole road.

77
00:03:57,901 --> 00:03:59,533
He's about a mile
in front of you.

78
00:03:59,568 --> 00:04:01,029
Seminole road?

79
00:04:01,072 --> 00:04:03,012
What the hell's down there?

80
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:10,088
It seems like I suffer
from an epidemic of bad timing,

81
00:04:10,397 --> 00:04:13,160
interrupted intimate moments
with boyfriends.

82
00:04:13,201 --> 00:04:17,533
Getting shot 16 times
wearing a really cool new dress.

83
00:04:17,836 --> 00:04:21,348
Brian's business trip coinciding
with our planned vacation.

84
00:04:21,515 --> 00:04:24,017
And now Simon playing hide and seek,

85
00:04:24,273 --> 00:04:27,233
just when I was going to get
some time off.

86
00:04:28,681 --> 00:04:31,706
- Simon?
- Come to make good on your promise?

87
00:04:35,128 --> 00:04:38,867
- You gave me your word.
- My word lasts as long as I do.

88
00:04:39,844 --> 00:04:42,298
Which, as you can see,
won't be much longer.

89
00:04:42,385 --> 00:04:45,763
- You knew we'd follow you.
- I wanted you to.

90
00:04:46,432 --> 00:04:48,898
- Where are the others?
- They're on their way.

91
00:04:49,078 --> 00:04:51,146
Then we don't have much time.

92
00:04:51,611 --> 00:04:53,868
There's something I want to give you.

93
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:57,915
Call it a return favor
for what you did for me.

94
00:04:58,016 --> 00:05:00,089
What is it you want to give me?

95
00:05:00,381 --> 00:05:02,254
The truth, Jane.

96
00:05:03,921 --> 00:05:05,778
Take my hand.

97
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,023
He was downstairs all the time,
he wasn't in the elevator.

98
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,430
Not when I got
to the lobby anyway.

99
00:05:49,867 --> 00:05:51,938
It's Jane, it's Jane!

100
00:05:56,173 --> 00:05:58,900
Ahhhh!

101
00:06:01,844 --> 00:06:03,141
How do you know these things?

102
00:06:03,176 --> 00:06:07,637
My memory of other people's
experiences is extensive.

103
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,765
I'm offering these to you.

104
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,914
Why? What does it mean?

105
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,403
They will make you
join them, Jane.

106
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,547
You are part of them now.

107
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:19,487
I don't understand.
Who will make me join them?

108
00:06:19,654 --> 00:06:21,270
Andre?

109
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:25,820
That already happened.
He made me join the team.

110
00:06:26,294 --> 00:06:27,874
Simon!

111
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:31,088
Simon!

112
00:06:50,834 --> 00:06:54,531
PAINKILLER JANE 1x18 "JANE 113"
Subtitles subXpacio and TusSeries

113
00:06:54,866 --> 00:06:57,107
- Where are the others?
- They're on their way.

114
00:06:57,157 --> 00:06:59,079
Then we don't have much time.

115
00:07:00,158 --> 00:07:02,137
There's something
I want to give you.

116
00:07:02,235 --> 00:07:03,958
Take my hand.

117
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,427
From the first
time I met Simon,

118
00:07:06,462 --> 00:07:08,848
he insisted we shared
some kind of bond.

119
00:07:09,094 --> 00:07:13,375
I resisted at first, but deep
down I sensed he was right.

120
00:07:13,991 --> 00:07:17,920
I wasn't going to let Andre ship his body
to Nico to be dissected and studied.

121
00:07:18,716 --> 00:07:20,804
I'd see to it
he got a proper burial,

122
00:07:21,122 --> 00:07:24,640
especially since he used his last
breath to give me those memories,

123
00:07:24,934 --> 00:07:28,191
memories that
would change my life, again.

124
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:30,868
A dozen deaths traced
directly to Vono-tek.

125
00:07:31,126 --> 00:07:33,181
He's on the express elevator.

126
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:45,944
Whatever the hell is going on with me,
I really need to know what it is.

127
00:07:46,219 --> 00:07:49,331
You are part of them.
They will make you join them, Jane.

128
00:07:49,525 --> 00:07:51,288
You are part of them now.

129
00:07:51,321 --> 00:07:52,948
Simon!

130
00:07:53,327 --> 00:07:55,942
Hey, it's okay.

131
00:07:56,496 --> 00:07:58,822
You're all right, sweetie?
You had a bad dream?

132
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,513
Yeah, I guess.

133
00:08:02,234 --> 00:08:03,757
What time is it?

134
00:08:04,018 --> 00:08:05,422
Almost 7:00.

135
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,383
Here, I made some coffee.

136
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,556
Wanna tell me about it?

137
00:08:13,623 --> 00:08:16,993
Yeah, it's too strong,
like always.

138
00:08:17,566 --> 00:08:19,926
I meant the nightmare.

139
00:08:21,387 --> 00:08:23,718
I think it had something
to do with...

140
00:08:23,977 --> 00:08:28,272
lying on a hot,
sunny beach in St. Thomas...

141
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:32,931
and then all of a sudden
I woke up and I was in Houston.

142
00:08:33,223 --> 00:08:37,031
- Blech! Frightening!
- Ok, I get it.

143
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:40,030
I owe you big time for this, but...

144
00:08:40,065 --> 00:08:42,707
the "apologizing" was definitely worth it.

145
00:08:46,676 --> 00:08:49,406
Perfect as always.

146
00:08:50,706 --> 00:08:52,508
You know, you could've come with me.

147
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:54,451
Oh, I don't know...

148
00:08:54,654 --> 00:08:58,359
White sand, palm trees,
virgin islands...

149
00:08:58,692 --> 00:09:00,825
or Texas.

150
00:09:01,112 --> 00:09:02,513
I don't think so.

151
00:09:02,548 --> 00:09:05,641
Yeah. Ok, I gotta go, babe.

152
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:08,477
Hey...

153
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:16,810
just so you'll know
what you're missing.

154
00:09:17,347 --> 00:09:19,402
Yeah, I know.

155
00:09:19,437 --> 00:09:21,496
I'll call you later.

156
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,416
Simon told me he wanted
to give me "the truth."

157
00:09:36,555 --> 00:09:41,909
Whatever he meant by that, it all seemed
to come back to the Emerald City.

158
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:45,144
Letting Andre know about
the knowledge Simon gave me,

159
00:09:45,179 --> 00:09:47,883
would be admitting
I had faked chipped him.

160
00:09:47,967 --> 00:09:50,721
And I certainly wasn't
about to involve Brian...

161
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:55,198
in something that would probably have to
bend the rules, and might cause trouble.

162
00:09:55,423 --> 00:09:59,000
So my trip to Vono-tek would
be a one-woman mission.

163
00:09:59,257 --> 00:10:01,446
But then again,

164
00:10:01,677 --> 00:10:03,878
I'm not your average woman.

165
00:10:29,924 --> 00:10:33,351
This was my first assignment
as part of Andre's team.

166
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:36,344
The first I ever heard
of Neuros.

167
00:10:36,408 --> 00:10:38,434
You are part of them now.

168
00:10:45,076 --> 00:10:47,629
Report to security on floor 114.

169
00:10:47,864 --> 00:10:49,859
Take the express elevator.

170
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:55,007
I'm in their climate control system.

171
00:10:55,068 --> 00:10:57,111
I'm monitoring Hyde's movement
through his heat signature.

172
00:10:57,133 --> 00:10:59,351
Just landed on the 46th floor.

173
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,582
Steve, no!

174
00:11:25,513 --> 00:11:27,759
He's entering
the express elevator now.

175
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,797
- You said the lobby, right?
- Yeah.

176
00:11:34,868 --> 00:11:36,655
- Hyde was not on the elevator.
- He had to be.

177
00:11:36,751 --> 00:11:38,710
There was no where else to get off.

178
00:11:38,745 --> 00:11:40,666
He's got to still be in the building.

179
00:11:41,085 --> 00:11:42,889
Hyde must be jamming
his security tag.

180
00:11:42,914 --> 00:11:46,881
Wherever he went, he obviously doesn't
want anyone watching, or the neuro doesn't.

181
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,644
- You're sure it was Hyde?
- I watched him get on that elevator.

182
00:12:03,663 --> 00:12:07,634
It's an express directly from 114
to the lobby, no stops in between.

183
00:12:08,091 --> 00:12:10,532
He was downstairs all the time.
He wasn't in the elevator.

184
00:12:10,567 --> 00:12:12,582
Not when it got to
the lobby, anyway.

185
00:12:12,593 --> 00:12:13,774
Is that even possible?

186
00:12:13,885 --> 00:12:15,953
Hey, I'm the new one
on the team, remember?

187
00:12:16,071 --> 00:12:17,786
I've still got a lot more
questions than answers.

188
00:12:17,805 --> 00:12:20,925
Right, so how do you like pushing carts?

189
00:12:21,088 --> 00:12:23,418
Probably about as much as
you like cleaning toilets.

190
00:12:23,582 --> 00:12:25,513
I'm having a bowl.

191
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:53,844
- What is it?
- The truth, Jane.

192
00:13:11,869 --> 00:13:13,972
I'm afraid you'll have
to come with us, miss.

193
00:13:51,124 --> 00:13:54,387
She had no formal ID,
no driver's license.

194
00:13:54,397 --> 00:13:56,879
Claimed she was a reporter
working on a story.

195
00:13:56,964 --> 00:13:59,754
We're running her now since you
said not to report her to the police.

196
00:13:59,878 --> 00:14:03,005
It's all right. I know who she is.

197
00:14:04,369 --> 00:14:06,047
Thank you.

198
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,465
My life took a huge turn the day
I met Andre McBride and his team.

199
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:32,011
That was the day that Neuro became
a regular part of my vocabulary.

200
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:34,991
The Vono-tek case killed
two of his agents,

201
00:14:35,011 --> 00:14:38,081
and I would have been the third
if it hadn't been for my healing.

202
00:14:38,116 --> 00:14:40,186
But the images Simon gave me...

203
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,983
suggests that there might be more
to that original case,

204
00:14:43,018 --> 00:14:45,036
than just rooting out a neuro.

205
00:14:49,749 --> 00:14:51,558
Oh, Stacey...

206
00:14:56,269 --> 00:14:58,754
- Oh, Stacey...
- Oh, yeah...

207
00:15:04,031 --> 00:15:05,723
Riley?

208
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,917
Hey! What're you doing here?

209
00:15:09,979 --> 00:15:12,348
I was going to about to ask
you the same thing.

210
00:15:13,441 --> 00:15:15,485
But I guess I don't have to.

211
00:15:16,896 --> 00:15:18,348
This is Stacey.

212
00:15:18,455 --> 00:15:20,822
Andre and Morgan, they were getting
nervous that I was the only one...

213
00:15:20,857 --> 00:15:22,981
that knew how to work our system.

214
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:25,748
I guess they figure safety in numbers.

215
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:29,785
Her IQ is in the genius range.
She's almost as smart as I am.

216
00:15:31,482 --> 00:15:34,508
Do you have a couple of minutes?
I need to ask you a few questions.

217
00:15:34,513 --> 00:15:36,385
Yeah, no problem.

218
00:15:38,197 --> 00:15:41,922
I was actually thinking just you.

219
00:15:42,152 --> 00:15:43,725
I got it.

220
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:46,057
I'll just go finish programming
the hard drives.

221
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:49,310
Thank you.

222
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:56,395
Riley, I need to know about Vono-tek.

223
00:15:56,841 --> 00:15:58,720
- What about?
- Unanswered questions.

224
00:15:58,812 --> 00:16:01,908
When we wrapped the case,
you were still trying to figure out...

225
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:04,640
how Hyde disappeared off
that express elevator.

226
00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:06,488
Yeah, but Andre shut me down.

227
00:16:06,581 --> 00:16:10,481
Said the neuro was chipped and shipped.
Time to move on.

228
00:16:10,532 --> 00:16:12,085
So, what did you find out?

229
00:16:14,647 --> 00:16:17,810
Ok, this is a wire-frame of
the Vono-tek tower. Now watch.

230
00:16:20,331 --> 00:16:23,174
There's an anomaly in the
overall dimensions of the tower.

231
00:16:23,219 --> 00:16:24,064
Which means?

232
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,740
If you go strictly by these plans,
it just doesn't add up.

233
00:16:27,033 --> 00:16:30,659
I mean, given the window dimensions
and the overall height of the building,

234
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:34,719
this 120 story building
is actually 121.

235
00:16:35,997 --> 00:16:38,834
Ok, I'm not Stacey.
Can you explain that to me?

236
00:16:38,859 --> 00:16:41,408
It's like a leap year. You
add a few seconds a day,

237
00:16:41,409 --> 00:16:44,158
every day and after four
years you have an extra day.

238
00:16:44,308 --> 00:16:46,923
In this case, an extra floor.

239
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,452
Okay.

240
00:16:49,487 --> 00:16:51,735
So according to all the building
schematics and elevator plans...

241
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,833
there is no extra floor.

242
00:16:54,748 --> 00:16:56,437
Here.

243
00:16:58,371 --> 00:17:01,240
Ok. The height difference is
most apparent right here.

244
00:17:01,662 --> 00:17:04,650
Just below the 114th floor
where Hyde got on that elevator.

245
00:17:04,822 --> 00:17:07,818
My guess is he probably
has a special key card...

246
00:17:07,853 --> 00:17:10,298
that gives him access
to the 113th floor.

247
00:17:10,493 --> 00:17:14,468
But, technically,
there is no 113th floor.

248
00:17:14,503 --> 00:17:18,251
Right. So now, you going to tell me
why you're so interested in this?

249
00:17:18,493 --> 00:17:20,805
Do you think you can find out a way
for me to get into that building...

250
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,451
and onto that floor?

251
00:17:22,601 --> 00:17:24,074
It was simple.

252
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,817
Riley agreed to help me
and keep it quiet.

253
00:17:27,052 --> 00:17:31,093
Because he knew something was up at
Vono-tek. But Andre had shut it down.

254
00:17:31,306 --> 00:17:33,237
And if there were two
things you can count on,

255
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:36,359
it's a work call from
Andre and Riley's ego.

256
00:17:36,439 --> 00:17:39,379
Okay, it looks like it's the transformer
in the main power vault.

257
00:17:39,501 --> 00:17:42,942
The place is locked up pretty tight
so you'll have to use your key cards.

258
00:17:42,963 --> 00:17:44,795
Let's go.

259
00:18:00,138 --> 00:18:03,335
Got it. It's out at the relay.
Just give me a second here.

260
00:18:04,729 --> 00:18:06,323
That will do it.

261
00:18:39,881 --> 00:18:42,884
Riley had given me fairly
detailed instructions,

262
00:18:43,229 --> 00:18:45,844
the rest was up to me.

263
00:21:32,073 --> 00:21:33,709
Hyde.

264
00:21:34,111 --> 00:21:36,015
Yes, I know,
I didn't forget.

265
00:21:36,442 --> 00:21:38,804
Yes, I'm leaving now.

266
00:23:12,107 --> 00:23:13,978
So how's the weather in Houston?

267
00:23:14,057 --> 00:23:15,048
Jane...

268
00:23:15,146 --> 00:23:16,941
Put your hands on the steering
wheel and don't move!

269
00:23:16,976 --> 00:23:17,839
Okay.

270
00:23:17,926 --> 00:23:19,958
And if you have any doubts
whether or not I'd use this...

271
00:23:20,053 --> 00:23:22,098
Look, if you give me a second,
I can explain.

272
00:23:22,132 --> 00:23:24,408
If you live long enough,
you'll have to.

273
00:23:26,518 --> 00:23:29,368
All right, I'm listening,

274
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:33,460
but I'm angry. And my fingers
tend to twitch when I'm lied to.

275
00:23:33,552 --> 00:23:35,568
Look, I told you I was going
to be in Houston because...

276
00:23:35,569 --> 00:23:37,585
I didn't want you getting
dragged into any of this.

277
00:23:37,647 --> 00:23:41,049
- And what is "this?"
- Just, let me back up.

278
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,587
The night that we first met,
at Club Misery...

279
00:23:43,649 --> 00:23:45,652
An appropriate name,
under the circumstances.

280
00:23:45,802 --> 00:23:47,844
it wasn't a happy coincidence.

281
00:23:47,947 --> 00:23:51,568
I knew you were gonna be there. I went
specifically because I wanted to meet you.

282
00:23:51,792 --> 00:23:54,173
- Why? You didn't even know me.
- No.

283
00:23:54,548 --> 00:23:56,284
But I knew about you.

284
00:23:56,903 --> 00:23:59,087
Your Vono-tek personnel
record was an alias...

285
00:23:59,144 --> 00:24:01,059
and when I tracked it down I found
out that you were the woman...

286
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,175
that took a 40 story plunge out a window.

287
00:24:03,367 --> 00:24:05,068
And died when I hit the ground.

288
00:24:05,207 --> 00:24:06,861
According to most reports.

289
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:09,635
But you didn't believe that.

290
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:13,424
I might have if the building you had
fallen from hadn't been Vono-tek.

291
00:24:13,516 --> 00:24:15,708
Explain that.
What the hell is going in there?

292
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,139
Well, that's what I'm trying
to figure out. That's...

293
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:22,451
Look, this could be a lot
easier for me to explain...

294
00:24:22,513 --> 00:24:24,970
if you'd let me
show you my research.

295
00:24:43,962 --> 00:24:45,355
What is this place?

296
00:24:46,254 --> 00:24:49,079
Ten years ago, Vono-tek
began a series of trials.

297
00:24:49,109 --> 00:24:51,575
The project code name
was "Revolution."

298
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:54,719
It was for a supervariant of HGH...

299
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,501
the human growth hormone.

300
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:59,234
At first glance,
it didn't seem too remarkable.

301
00:24:59,326 --> 00:25:02,317
Pharmaceutical companies run
approved tests all the time.

302
00:25:02,352 --> 00:25:04,968
- What made this different?
- A few things.

303
00:25:05,283 --> 00:25:08,980
The trials were approved by
the FDA for a 16-month period.

304
00:25:09,033 --> 00:25:11,861
Vono-tek petitioned for a longer
period but they didn't get it.

305
00:25:12,175 --> 00:25:14,613
They filed for extensions but...

306
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:18,068
when the feds reviewed their records,
they turned it down...

307
00:25:18,162 --> 00:25:20,814
Vono-tek never pressed for
an extension after that.

308
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:24,067
But they did continue the trials
without approval.

309
00:25:27,866 --> 00:25:31,299
Different project.
This one says, "Helios."

310
00:25:31,528 --> 00:25:34,792
Everything that I could dig up,
which wasn't easy,

311
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:38,865
suggests that Helios is an extension
of the Revolution project.

312
00:25:39,564 --> 00:25:43,700
Al right, so they slipped one
past the FDA.

313
00:25:43,723 --> 00:25:45,619
I'm sure it happens all the time.

314
00:25:46,281 --> 00:25:50,217
But there is a lot of things about Helios
that don't happen all the time.

315
00:25:52,196 --> 00:25:54,248
Colleen Stukey.

316
00:25:54,608 --> 00:25:56,612
Eric Craig.

317
00:25:57,379 --> 00:25:59,231
Ruben Hennesy.

318
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:01,184
Elyse Collins.

319
00:26:02,256 --> 00:26:04,744
Eleanor Morton.
Phillip Statler.

320
00:26:05,014 --> 00:26:07,024
Simon Connolly.

321
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:10,321
All these people participated
in the Helios trials.

322
00:26:10,393 --> 00:26:12,375
Some of the people
up here are dead.

323
00:26:12,953 --> 00:26:15,009
None died of natural causes.

324
00:26:16,067 --> 00:26:18,712
Harry Beeman was stabbed
to death.

325
00:26:19,125 --> 00:26:22,517
Elizabeth Boone was shot
in the back of the head.

326
00:26:22,992 --> 00:26:26,185
But the vast majority of
these people have just gone missing.

327
00:26:26,342 --> 00:26:29,318
Simply vanished from
the face of the Earth.

328
00:26:30,384 --> 00:26:32,131
And then there's me,

329
00:26:32,696 --> 00:26:36,759
the girl who went through the window
and lived to tell about it.

330
00:26:37,168 --> 00:26:40,464
How did you think I fit
into your little story?

331
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,184
I wasn't sure.

332
00:26:44,993 --> 00:26:49,034
But a woman using an alias,
surviving a 40-story fall...

333
00:26:50,595 --> 00:26:54,151
Before we met you, my
head was full of questions.

334
00:26:54,232 --> 00:26:56,373
I don't recall you asking.

335
00:26:57,331 --> 00:26:59,483
That's because once we met...

336
00:27:00,092 --> 00:27:02,293
we finally started to talk...

337
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:05,928
any thoughts of you being
part of my story...

338
00:27:07,273 --> 00:27:09,842
First rule of reporting,

339
00:27:10,725 --> 00:27:14,057
never get personally
involved with a story.

340
00:27:14,253 --> 00:27:15,531
I didn't, Jane.

341
00:27:15,757 --> 00:27:18,267
I kept telling myself
I'd get around of that.

342
00:27:18,859 --> 00:27:22,436
In the process we got closer.

343
00:27:22,502 --> 00:27:25,758
- Close enough for you to lie to me.
- Only about why I went to the club.

344
00:27:25,829 --> 00:27:27,168
I mean, as things progressed,

345
00:27:27,425 --> 00:27:31,508
I told myself I'd leave you out
of anything related to Vono-tek.

346
00:27:32,503 --> 00:27:35,292
You're a helluva lot more important
to me than a story, Jane.

347
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:39,007
I wish you could believe that.

348
00:27:39,076 --> 00:27:40,934
Like I believed you were in Houston?

349
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:43,919
I've done everything I can
to keep this away from you.

350
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:47,243
I finally managed to work myself
into the company's good graces...

351
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:50,115
and score a series
of interviews with Randall Hyde.

352
00:27:50,911 --> 00:27:53,028
They're scheduled for this week.

353
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,517
I need those interviews, Jane.

354
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:58,229
So I had a choice I could...

355
00:27:58,731 --> 00:28:02,284
could lie to you
and keep you out of this...

356
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:06,725
- ...or I could tell you the truth and...
- Ruin everything?

357
00:28:12,975 --> 00:28:16,698
This man, Hyde.
He's not the top dog, is he?

358
00:28:17,073 --> 00:28:21,178
No. Dr. John Roberts is the founder
and driving force behind the company.

359
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:25,041
But the man's a recluse. He doesn't
come out, doesn't give interviews...

360
00:28:25,729 --> 00:28:28,278
Last I heard, he's suffering from ALS.

361
00:28:28,325 --> 00:28:31,284
He's confined to a wheelchair
and doesn't have much time.

362
00:28:31,433 --> 00:28:33,123
Hyde is his eyes, ears and legs.

363
00:28:33,214 --> 00:28:35,828
So, if I wanted to get to Roberts,
I'd have to go through Hyde.

364
00:28:35,983 --> 00:28:37,857
I don't think anybody gets to Roberts.

365
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:41,088
As you've often said, "I'm not "anybody."

366
00:28:45,858 --> 00:28:49,742
GO RAMBLERS

367
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:15,371
What is it?

368
00:29:25,737 --> 00:29:29,393
I don't have a lot of time,
but you said it was important.

369
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,749
More important than you know.
Leave us alone.

370
00:29:33,837 --> 00:29:35,999
- Jane, I...
- I'll contact you.

371
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:42,769
If you think this is the way to get
answers, Miss Vasco, you're wrong.

372
00:29:43,064 --> 00:29:44,962
Well, at least
you know my name.

373
00:29:44,967 --> 00:29:46,878
So no introductions are necessary.

374
00:29:46,997 --> 00:29:48,517
It's your choice, Mr. Hyde.

375
00:29:49,134 --> 00:29:52,894
You'll either talk to me,
or end up just like me.

376
00:31:00,016 --> 00:31:01,767
You see, miss Vasco...

377
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:04,969
I already am just like you.

378
00:31:07,056 --> 00:31:10,053
Sir, she's already discovered
"the facility."

379
00:31:10,655 --> 00:31:14,341
She actually managed to get her hands on
a sample of the formula and a hypodermic.

380
00:31:15,322 --> 00:31:17,791
No, she seems to be aware of that.

381
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,431
And she's quite persistent
and she's demanding answers.

382
00:31:22,674 --> 00:31:26,988
I think it would be best to
avoid any problems. Yes, sir.

383
00:31:29,613 --> 00:31:31,083
Right.

384
00:31:33,247 --> 00:31:35,315
He said he'll talk to you.

385
00:31:35,859 --> 00:31:37,736
My place or yours?

386
00:31:48,316 --> 00:31:50,095
Jane.

387
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,903
You seem surprised to see me.

388
00:32:00,928 --> 00:32:02,954
I thought that's what you requested.

389
00:32:03,574 --> 00:32:06,148
I heard you were ill.
Wheelchair bound.

390
00:32:06,233 --> 00:32:07,637
And I was.

391
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,013
May I offer you something?

392
00:32:10,149 --> 00:32:11,825
Answers,

393
00:32:12,888 --> 00:32:13,928
that's all.

394
00:32:13,953 --> 00:32:16,367
I think I should be able
to provide you with those.

395
00:32:17,836 --> 00:32:20,687
- Just like that.
- You seem to know most of it.

396
00:32:20,907 --> 00:32:23,675
Perhaps if you hear all of it,
you'll be inclined to...

397
00:32:24,517 --> 00:32:26,356
Understand.

398
00:32:29,056 --> 00:32:32,983
For years Vono-tek's been a world
leader in cutting edge medications.

399
00:32:33,563 --> 00:32:36,519
We've been the first
to provide cures and treatments...

400
00:32:36,643 --> 00:32:40,667
for some of the planet's most
virulent and lethal diseases.

401
00:32:41,248 --> 00:32:44,138
That was our goal when
I began the company.

402
00:32:44,211 --> 00:32:45,619
Having achieved
that goal...

403
00:32:45,912 --> 00:32:48,227
I felt that we needed
to do more.

404
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,419
So you decided to play
with human genetics.

405
00:32:50,543 --> 00:32:52,152
Experiment.

406
00:32:53,029 --> 00:32:56,310
With all the time and
research we had put in...

407
00:32:56,404 --> 00:32:58,012
to cure and prevent disease,

408
00:32:58,199 --> 00:33:00,478
I believed our efforts would be
better served

409
00:33:00,565 --> 00:33:04,120
by directing them into improving
the species.

410
00:33:04,445 --> 00:33:06,032
Improving?

411
00:33:06,372 --> 00:33:09,784
And who decides
what defines "improving?"

412
00:33:09,807 --> 00:33:12,024
I don't believe my standards
are that unique.

413
00:33:12,211 --> 00:33:13,910
Imagine, people who don't get sick,

414
00:33:14,002 --> 00:33:16,628
people whose immune
systems are so developed...

415
00:33:16,778 --> 00:33:19,374
that they can fight off almost
anything that attacks them.

416
00:33:20,276 --> 00:33:22,460
When was the last time
you had a cold?

417
00:33:23,383 --> 00:33:25,022
Go on.

418
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:28,112
If we can improve
the human animal,

419
00:33:29,819 --> 00:33:33,408
empower its cellular
structure to fight disease,

420
00:33:33,628 --> 00:33:35,680
to regenerate, to heal...

421
00:33:36,446 --> 00:33:42,014
we'd no longer have to combat plagues
that face us one after another.

422
00:33:42,038 --> 00:33:45,119
If you could do that, you'd
put yourself out of business.

423
00:33:45,271 --> 00:33:47,263
I have everything I need.

424
00:33:47,889 --> 00:33:51,384
My goal now is to provide them with
something that's not just...

425
00:33:51,413 --> 00:33:56,279
stopgap antidotes, but something
that will change us forever.

426
00:33:56,308 --> 00:33:58,362
By creating genetic freaks.

427
00:34:01,179 --> 00:34:03,107
Let me show you something.

428
00:34:04,431 --> 00:34:08,247
Genetic research is not
unlike pharmaceutical research.

429
00:34:08,401 --> 00:34:11,678
Perfecting the product
is a result of trial and error.

430
00:34:12,277 --> 00:34:16,115
I began my experiments
over two decades ago.

431
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:21,424
And, yes, many of the original
subjects did turn out to be freaks.

432
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,898
But it was all in the name of science.

433
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:27,764
The people you see in
this room are alive.

434
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:31,737
Their biological functions have
been dialed down, so to speak.

435
00:34:33,168 --> 00:34:35,959
They require very little
to sustain them.

436
00:34:37,164 --> 00:34:40,588
These people are
the result of some of my...

437
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:42,240
mistakes.

438
00:34:42,279 --> 00:34:44,233
People you call Neuros.

439
00:34:44,976 --> 00:34:48,943
But over the years,
I've come a long way.

440
00:34:49,324 --> 00:34:54,572
You and Randall and I are
the result of my success.

441
00:34:54,691 --> 00:34:56,362
How nice for us.

442
00:34:56,947 --> 00:34:59,372
I consider what I've
given you a gift.

443
00:34:59,427 --> 00:35:02,382
- Sorry, I never sent a thank you card.
- Jane,

444
00:35:02,918 --> 00:35:05,794
not only are you immune from most disease,

445
00:35:06,205 --> 00:35:09,102
not only do you possess
the ability to heal...

446
00:35:09,309 --> 00:35:12,234
but each time your body
regenerates itself,

447
00:35:12,309 --> 00:35:14,490
your cells actually learn.

448
00:35:15,553 --> 00:35:19,792
They get smarter. The longer
you live, the stronger you get.

449
00:35:20,721 --> 00:35:23,461
- You've cured death.
- No.

450
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:26,268
Not yet, anyway.

451
00:35:26,349 --> 00:35:29,691
There seems to be a built-in
timer that, despite the variations,

452
00:35:29,951 --> 00:35:32,518
tells the cells when
it's time to quit.

453
00:35:32,543 --> 00:35:33,709
I'm working on it.

454
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:35,775
Perhaps it was put there
intentionally,

455
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:38,437
by a force that even you
can't overcome.

456
00:35:39,314 --> 00:35:40,988
I'm not playing god, Jane.

457
00:35:41,083 --> 00:35:44,164
I'm just trying to become
a useful partner.

458
00:35:44,218 --> 00:35:46,953
I'm doing what I can
for these people...

459
00:35:47,256 --> 00:35:51,421
to correct earlier failures,
to collect them as you have.

460
00:35:51,537 --> 00:35:52,657
Why me?

461
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:58,878
What did I do to earn the honor
to participate in all of this?

462
00:35:58,985 --> 00:36:02,224
You're young, you're healthy and you
are the newest member of the team.

463
00:36:02,309 --> 00:36:03,527
Out of the group,

464
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,008
I thought you'd make
the strongest ally.

465
00:36:07,282 --> 00:36:09,412
Care to tell me what
you've done with my "people?"

466
00:36:09,535 --> 00:36:12,362
all I care about right now
is exposing what you're doing.

467
00:36:13,349 --> 00:36:17,515
I believe most people deserve the chance
to worship the god of their choice.

468
00:36:17,936 --> 00:36:19,808
You won't do that.

469
00:36:19,825 --> 00:36:21,518
You're part of us.

470
00:36:21,859 --> 00:36:23,742
You are part of them now.

471
00:36:24,787 --> 00:36:27,027
Knowing what you
turned me into,

472
00:36:27,874 --> 00:36:29,367
how do you expect
to stop me?

473
00:36:29,402 --> 00:36:32,824
You're strong, Jane,
and getting stronger.

474
00:36:33,142 --> 00:36:37,575
But knowing what I created and
having learned from others' mistakes...

475
00:36:38,051 --> 00:36:41,315
You'd expect I'd know
how to control it.

476
00:36:44,537 --> 00:36:47,150
They will make you join them, Jane.

477
00:36:55,529 --> 00:36:57,511
Get her ready.

478
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:14,733
You will thank me, Jane.

479
00:37:14,915 --> 00:37:18,902
And, for the gift I gave you,
you'll be eternally grateful.

480
00:37:35,088 --> 00:37:37,713
Andre spent seven years
with special forces.

481
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:42,879
He was recruited by a man named Gerald
Morgan to head up special operations.

482
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,084
Thank you. To the future.

483
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:55,776
I'm not that familiar with
a lot of the case histories...

484
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:57,863
prior to my joining the team.

485
00:37:58,037 --> 00:38:01,490
I do know they lost
one agent shortly before

486
00:38:01,574 --> 00:38:03,511
Maureen and I came aboard.

487
00:38:03,601 --> 00:38:05,580
You do know about maureen?

488
00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:07,514
I know who she is.

489
00:38:08,664 --> 00:38:10,639
Who she was.

490
00:38:10,934 --> 00:38:12,438
I'm sorry.

491
00:38:12,518 --> 00:38:14,838
Right now, we're fairly
short on manpower.

492
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,862
Connor King, Andre and I are handling
the field operations while Riley is...

493
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:22,635
- Riley Jensen.
- Yes.

494
00:38:22,779 --> 00:38:27,404
Riley keeps us wired into whatever
information we need to have.

495
00:38:27,902 --> 00:38:29,938
And then there's Sseth.

496
00:38:30,132 --> 00:38:31,859
Dr. Carpenter...

497
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:35,686
who for the last year has tried
to figure out what I am.

498
00:38:35,805 --> 00:38:38,529
And my test subjects,
The neuros...

499
00:38:39,074 --> 00:38:42,443
I know you send them off
to a place called Nico.

500
00:38:42,757 --> 00:38:44,663
Unfortunately, your people
have done a good job

501
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:46,814
of keeping its location
from being discovered.

502
00:38:46,981 --> 00:38:50,752
It's my understanding
when the operation began,

503
00:38:50,845 --> 00:38:55,783
they confined the neuros, the people,
somewhere here in the States.

504
00:38:56,302 --> 00:38:58,310
But as the numbers mounted,

505
00:38:58,359 --> 00:39:01,203
they needed to operate
with more anonymity,

506
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:05,886
so they relocated Nico
to somewhere in Eastern Europe,

507
00:39:06,905 --> 00:39:08,631
Hungary, I believe.

508
00:39:08,724 --> 00:39:09,678
You've never been there?

509
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:13,589
No, it's mostly a medical
and containment facility.

510
00:39:13,624 --> 00:39:16,347
There wouldn't be much
there for us to do.

511
00:39:17,515 --> 00:39:19,765
Unless a problem developed.

512
00:39:20,815 --> 00:39:22,285
It's a shame.

513
00:39:22,303 --> 00:39:24,317
So many of my people.

514
00:39:24,424 --> 00:39:27,346
So many "mistakes"
I'd like to correct.

515
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:32,232
Thank you for being so open.

516
00:39:32,947 --> 00:39:36,629
I think you see now that people often
fear what they don't understand.

517
00:39:38,212 --> 00:39:39,649
I think I always knew that.

518
00:39:39,741 --> 00:39:41,066
I'm sure you did.

519
00:39:41,151 --> 00:39:43,980
Oh, there is the matter
of your boyfriend, Brian.

520
00:39:44,901 --> 00:39:47,875
Yes, he has a lot of
information on Vono-tek,

521
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:52,050
the early Helios trials,
the missing people.

522
00:39:52,085 --> 00:39:54,718
I'm sure he'll be anxious
to learn what you've discovered.

523
00:39:56,932 --> 00:39:58,811
I'm sure he will.

524
00:39:59,652 --> 00:40:02,738
Good night, Jane,
and thank you again.

525
00:40:03,621 --> 00:40:06,490
I've looked forward
to this day for a long time.

526
00:40:12,509 --> 00:40:14,508
We'll be in touch.

527
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:36,314
Hey, yeah, it's me.

528
00:40:38,323 --> 00:40:40,354
Of course, I'm okay.

529
00:40:42,238 --> 00:40:44,532
I've a lot I want to tell you.

530
00:40:45,548 --> 00:40:47,003
Yeah.

531
00:40:47,049 --> 00:40:48,914
You free for dinner?

532
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:54,226
My place. Where else?

533
00:40:56,035 --> 00:40:58,113
Didn't make it
to a warm sunny island,

534
00:40:58,588 --> 00:41:02,331
pretend to be in Houston,
or catch up on my reading.

535
00:41:02,586 --> 00:41:07,488
But I did get an insider's perspective
on the inner workings of Vono-tek...

536
00:41:08,062 --> 00:41:09,822
and no matter what,

537
00:41:09,916 --> 00:41:13,400
I'll bet I'll still have
the best story on the team.

538
00:41:13,667 --> 00:41:19,113
Of course, some stories
are best left untold.

539
00:41:23,874 --> 00:41:25,183
Hello, everybody.

540
00:41:25,309 --> 00:41:28,215
What's up Doc?
How was the vacation?

541
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:32,334
It was quite the informative gathering.
Very relaxing. Very pleasant.

542
00:41:32,369 --> 00:41:35,225
I know you got a heart in there, Doc.
And we're gonna find it one day.

543
00:41:35,458 --> 00:41:36,984
Did you catch anything?

544
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,006
Yes, I had quite a run of good luck.

545
00:41:39,041 --> 00:41:42,796
I finally beat Dr. Samuel Cranston.
After six years of trying.

546
00:41:44,077 --> 00:41:46,412
What exactly did you beat him at?

547
00:41:46,866 --> 00:41:48,851
Or do we want to know?

548
00:41:51,062 --> 00:41:53,135
5.62 pounds.

549
00:41:53,622 --> 00:41:55,990
Wow, really quite
an achievement.

550
00:41:56,025 --> 00:41:58,003
Quite tasty to eat, I'd imagine.

551
00:41:58,038 --> 00:41:59,288
Oh, no, I didn't eat him.

552
00:41:59,313 --> 00:42:02,925
Well, he's not moving very much
so you couldn't throw him back.

553
00:42:03,043 --> 00:42:05,611
No, I gave him
to Dr. Cranston.

554
00:42:05,646 --> 00:42:11,122
There's something about cutting into a
fish that just makes me a little queasy.

555
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:14,588
Thank you, good to see you.

556
00:42:18,011 --> 00:42:19,454
And you, Jane?

557
00:42:19,543 --> 00:42:21,352
Catch up on your reading?

558
00:42:21,473 --> 00:42:25,863
Yes. It was dull, quiet,
completely uneventful...

559
00:42:26,261 --> 00:42:28,166
and just perfect.

560
00:42:28,317 --> 00:42:29,539
And Brian?

561
00:42:29,665 --> 00:42:34,123
Let's just say, I'm looking forward to
my payback for his trip to Houston.

562
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:40,306
Well, kids we undoubtedly have some work
to do, so let's get back to it. Riley?

563
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,988
You're free for dinner?

564
00:42:45,489 --> 00:42:47,380
My place...

565
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:53,904
