00:00:00,747 --> 00:00:02,153
My name is jane vasco.

2
00:00:02,245 --> 00:00:03,516
I could
use you on my team.

3
00:00:03,577 --> 00:00:07,011
I work for a secret government
agency that hunts neuros.

4
00:00:07,124 --> 00:00:10,322
People who can do dangerous
things with their minds.

5
00:00:11,258 --> 00:00:12,634
On my first assignment...

6
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:17,951
Something a little weird happened,
okay, something really weird.

7
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:22,715
Until i get some answers i'm getting
on with my life, doing my job.

8
00:00:23,299 --> 00:00:28,230
Stocking up on aspirin,
because let me tell ya,

9
00:00:28,549 --> 00:00:30,103
pain's a bitch!

10
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:20,603
How's the wine?

11
00:01:20,728 --> 00:01:22,150
Delicious.

12
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:25,979
A client of mine
owns a vineyard.

13
00:01:27,498 --> 00:01:28,811
I was thinking of
going up there.

14
00:01:28,869 --> 00:01:29,933
Feel like a long weekend?

15
00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:31,810
I'd love to, I just...

16
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:34,531
I don't know
if i can get away.

17
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:36,030
The job, right?

18
00:01:36,873 --> 00:01:37,602
Tom...

19
00:01:37,648 --> 00:01:38,920
We've talked about this.

20
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,149
You mean, we've talked
about not talking about it.

21
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:43,095
I'm sorry, i just...

22
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:46,242
It's okay,
i love the mystery.

23
00:01:46,288 --> 00:01:47,285
Well...

24
00:01:48,658 --> 00:01:51,058
Maybe tonight we can solve
some of that mystery.

25
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,658
This merits a refill.

26
00:01:56,286 --> 00:01:57,796
I'll be right back.

27
00:02:13,722 --> 00:02:14,722
Tom...?

29
00:02:55,637 --> 00:02:57,136
Everyone's has things
they hide.

30
00:02:57,723 --> 00:02:58,873
Usually they are small,

31
00:02:59,537 --> 00:03:01,860
watching daytime soaps
while scarfing down

32
00:03:01,907 --> 00:03:04,831
enough chocolate to send
you into a sugar coma.

33
00:03:05,016 --> 00:03:06,993
Letting enough underwear
pile up in the corner

34
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,432
until you are actually forced
to go out and buy more.

35
00:03:09,513 --> 00:03:12,889
Not that i would have any personal
knowledge of this of course.

36
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,721
When i was little,
i was like all little girls,

37
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:17,987
sharing my secrets
with my friends.

38
00:03:18,103 --> 00:03:21,151
When i grew up i realized
that a real secret

39
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,648
is something you don't
share with anyone.

40
00:03:23,775 --> 00:03:27,220
The secret i have now
is anything but small.

41
00:03:27,475 --> 00:03:28,376
In fact, it's so huge

42
00:03:28,446 --> 00:03:30,761
i don't even talk
to myself about it.

43
00:03:31,952 --> 00:03:34,010
I've already considered
the "reasonable" explanations!

44
00:03:34,044 --> 00:03:34,865
And there aren't any.

45
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,495
How long had you
known this guy?

46
00:03:36,565 --> 00:03:38,356
Long enough to know that
he wasn't suicidal!

47
00:03:38,449 --> 00:03:40,033
Six months,
wasn't it?

48
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:43,523
And in six months, you've
never gotten close to anybody?

49
00:03:44,028 --> 00:03:47,137
Look, he was a good man
and i'm not an idiot.

50
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,895
And i'm not in the habit
of walking around,

51
00:03:48,952 --> 00:03:51,207
looking for neuros behind
every closet door!

52
00:03:51,288 --> 00:03:54,056
There are a million other
explanations for this.

53
00:03:54,103 --> 00:03:55,964
And it may not look like it,
but we have procedures.

54
00:03:55,998 --> 00:03:57,316
Procedure?

55
00:03:57,444 --> 00:03:59,201
One moment this man's
asking me to the wine country

56
00:03:59,247 --> 00:04:01,709
and the next thing,
he walks off a roof?

57
00:04:02,091 --> 00:04:03,337
I understand how
you feel...

58
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:06,234
No, you don't.

59
00:04:06,384 --> 00:04:08,442
You've been through
a tough loss, bowers.

60
00:04:08,546 --> 00:04:09,968
Take a few days.

61
00:04:18,878 --> 00:04:20,994
A friend of mine
owns the vineyard.

62
00:04:22,277 --> 00:04:23,491
I was thinking of
going up there.

63
00:04:23,537 --> 00:04:25,219
Feel like a long weekend?

64
00:04:26,271 --> 00:04:27,693
I don't know..

65
00:04:28,294 --> 00:04:29,196
I'd love to.

66
00:04:29,231 --> 00:04:31,543
I just don't know
if i can get away.

67
00:04:31,612 --> 00:04:32,610
The job, right?

68
00:04:32,988 --> 00:04:34,375
Where'd you get this?

69
00:04:34,468 --> 00:04:35,514
Restaurant security.

70
00:04:35,606 --> 00:04:37,387
I had riley
run an enhance.

71
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,388
I'll be right back.

72
00:04:45,483 --> 00:04:46,269
Okay.

73
00:04:47,483 --> 00:04:48,483
Tom?

74
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:57,547
Bowers thinks there's
a neuro behind it.

75
00:04:57,548 --> 00:04:58,548
Thoughts?

76
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,724
Perhaps she didn't know the man
as wel as she thought she did.

77
00:05:02,794 --> 00:05:06,296
Everyone's got things going on in
their lives people don't know about.

78
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,239
But you see where
she's coming from.

79
00:05:08,565 --> 00:05:10,753
She's got to fit
a reason to this.

80
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,915
Something that
makes sense to her.

81
00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:15,978
Because if she can-
then she's not powerless.

82
00:05:17,628 --> 00:05:20,316
When you lose somebody you
love, you've got three choices.

83
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:23,592
You can blame them
for not staying safe.

84
00:05:24,228 --> 00:05:27,130
You can blame yourself
for not protecting them.

85
00:05:27,581 --> 00:05:32,702
Or you can find out who's really
to blame, and make them pay.

86
00:05:34,332 --> 00:05:35,655
Bowers needs an ass
to kick?

87
00:05:36,505 --> 00:05:37,505
Yes.

88
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,383
Don't tell her i said this

89
00:05:41,881 --> 00:05:43,231
we're a lot alike
that way.

90
00:05:44,131 --> 00:05:47,117
We're not good with "just
letting things happen. "

91
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:52,710
i've got three other cases
with limited resources.

92
00:05:52,817 --> 00:05:54,917
I can't justify spending
time on something

93
00:05:55,126 --> 00:05:56,429
that's so far
off profile.

94
00:05:57,276 --> 00:05:59,054
Who are you trying
to convince?

95
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:00,817
You.

96
00:06:01,348 --> 00:06:03,253
Bowers will have
to deal with it.

97
00:06:03,672 --> 00:06:04,816
Let it go.

98
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:25,965
I thought you'd
gone home.

99
00:06:26,682 --> 00:06:27,780
Guess not.

100
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:30,668
Look, mo...

101
00:06:30,696 --> 00:06:35,412
If you came to argue mcbride's
case, save your breath.

102
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:38,031
Maybe i came to ask
you about yours.

103
00:06:40,327 --> 00:06:42,338
And maybe there's
a tooth fairy.

104
00:07:05,781 --> 00:07:07,481
Interesting place.

105
00:07:07,562 --> 00:07:09,076
What made you pick it?

106
00:07:09,122 --> 00:07:11,481
A friend of mine was here
the other day.

107
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,659
I was...

108
00:07:16,191 --> 00:07:17,277
Curious.

109
00:07:17,693 --> 00:07:18,826
I was too.

110
00:07:19,945 --> 00:07:21,890
About why i haven't
heard from you.

111
00:07:23,197 --> 00:07:24,197
I'm glad you called.

112
00:07:25,133 --> 00:07:26,133
How's the new job?

113
00:07:27,757 --> 00:07:29,556
You can't talk about it.

114
00:07:30,443 --> 00:07:31,443
Yes, i get that.

115
00:07:32,321 --> 00:07:36,553
Special federal detail, whatever.

116
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,432
I'm not asking for
case files, jane.

117
00:07:39,632 --> 00:07:41,559
I just want to know
how you're doing.

118
00:07:43,154 --> 00:07:44,256
You like the people?

119
00:07:44,818 --> 00:07:46,564
Or is that a secret,
too?

120
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,509
Maybe this wasn't
such a good idea.

121
00:07:58,132 --> 00:08:00,285
Maybe you could
turn it into one.

122
00:08:02,042 --> 00:08:03,522
Maybe i can.

123
00:08:06,077 --> 00:08:07,122
That merits a refill.

124
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,321
I'll be right back.

125
00:08:18,194 --> 00:08:19,194
Justin!

126
00:08:22,258 --> 00:08:23,358
Let's get out of here.

127
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,270
Your place?

128
00:08:31,085 --> 00:08:32,907
Yeah, why not?

129
00:08:32,965 --> 00:08:34,214
Life's short.

130
00:08:45,557 --> 00:08:47,661
You here to tell me
to keep my left up?

131
00:08:48,218 --> 00:08:49,282
You ought to know.

132
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,224
You gonna cut
me some slack?

133
00:08:51,351 --> 00:08:53,686
Then i'd have to admit
that i can be a bitch.

134
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,020
Can i cop a plea?

135
00:09:03,773 --> 00:09:05,195
I saw justin last night.

136
00:09:07,301 --> 00:09:07,786
Careful.

137
00:09:07,844 --> 00:09:09,162
You might let
him get close.

138
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,411
I did.

139
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:13,948
We had drinks...

140
00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:16,649
At the skybar.

141
00:09:20,114 --> 00:09:28,645
I just wanted to tell you,
if what happened to tom...

142
00:09:30,947 --> 00:09:33,768
Happened to someone
i was close to,

143
00:09:37,421 --> 00:09:39,040
i'd be asking questions,
too.

144
00:09:51,271 --> 00:09:52,271
Tom larsen.

145
00:09:53,085 --> 00:09:55,064
On the surface,
looks clean.

146
00:09:56,211 --> 00:09:57,700
Clean enough to start
up with maureen.

147
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:58,770
Did you run the clearance?

148
00:09:58,822 --> 00:09:59,610
The feds did it.

149
00:09:59,645 --> 00:10:01,923
If i ran it, i wouldn't
have missed the obvious.

150
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,009
I'm listening.

151
00:10:03,999 --> 00:10:06,012
Guy's file was
just too clean.

152
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:09,251
Most people have forgotten credit
lines with no recent activity.

153
00:10:10,054 --> 00:10:12,083
Or info shows up in
duplicate

154
00:10:12,176 --> 00:10:14,065
because data clerks used
different protocols.

155
00:10:14,158 --> 00:10:17,264
It's normal, you get used to
culling the signal from the noise.

156
00:10:17,363 --> 00:10:18,378
And tom larsen?

157
00:10:18,448 --> 00:10:21,211
All signal, no noise.

158
00:10:21,361 --> 00:10:22,360
Pristine.

159
00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:25,088
Everything totally credible
- devoid of human error.

160
00:10:25,787 --> 00:10:29,128
And, to me, clean is
suspiciously messy.

161
00:10:33,521 --> 00:10:36,221
The reason tom larsen's
real identity was scrubbed

162
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,685
is because the man was
in witness protection.

163
00:11:01,001 --> 00:11:05,407
Tom larsen spent the first 25
years of his life as gene crowley.

164
00:11:05,626 --> 00:11:07,276
He was an accountant
in santa fe.

165
00:11:08,063 --> 00:11:09,113
Was doing pretty good

166
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,486
until he cooked the books
for the gage cartel.

167
00:11:11,626 --> 00:11:14,176
And got renamed and relocated
by witness protection

168
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,861
when he testified
against them.

169
00:11:19,251 --> 00:11:20,901
I didn't authorize
this research.

170
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,375
You didn't nix it either.

171
00:11:22,436 --> 00:11:23,935
Crowley wasn't a
volunteer witness.

172
00:11:23,936 --> 00:11:26,986
State got him to turn on the
gage cartel to save his own ass.

173
00:11:28,311 --> 00:11:29,861
They had him on
murder charges.

174
00:11:29,937 --> 00:11:31,637
Found his wife in
a shallow grave.

175
00:11:32,937 --> 00:11:35,111
Apparently the guy had
anger management issues.

176
00:11:35,146 --> 00:11:37,150
And bowers was
dating this creep?

177
00:11:38,063 --> 00:11:39,613
How strong was
the case on him?

178
00:11:39,937 --> 00:11:42,338
Strong enough to get him to risk
his life by taking the stand.

179
00:11:42,384 --> 00:11:46,099
Another 50 reasons the guy might've
stepped off that roof intentionally.

180
00:11:46,442 --> 00:11:47,889
Do you have the printout
i asked for?

181
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:48,890
Yeah.

182
00:11:52,805 --> 00:11:53,741
Thank you.

183
00:11:55,329 --> 00:11:56,329
Thanks.

184
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,580
Yeah.

185
00:12:06,035 --> 00:12:09,839
Miklos rovak, aka
michael varga.

186
00:12:09,954 --> 00:12:18,026
Cook county, illinois,
file number 41471103-f.

187
00:12:53,569 --> 00:12:56,669
riley pulled another witness
relocation hit out of the system.

188
00:12:56,754 --> 00:12:59,442
Looks like you might've been
onto something with larsen.

189
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,459
A liar and a fraud.

190
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,933
Michael varga.

191
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:06,630
"shoe store owner. "

192
00:13:07,378 --> 00:13:09,178
former contract
killer from chicago.

193
00:13:10,504 --> 00:13:13,204
Varga drove his car over
a cliff at 100 miles an hour.

194
00:13:13,819 --> 00:13:16,519
I pulled gps readings
from the local police mainframe.

195
00:13:17,442 --> 00:13:20,042
Have no idea why he didn't
stop to take that detour.

196
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,185
Tom never stopped before
walking off the roof.

197
00:13:23,133 --> 00:13:24,982
There have been at least
two others.

198
00:13:25,133 --> 00:13:29,144
State's witnesses, living
under assumed identies,

199
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:33,154
dying suddenly under what can only be
described as "mysterious circumstances".

200
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:36,441
Check this out.

201
00:13:37,194 --> 00:13:40,503
Kevin moore walked off
an airplane at 30,000 feet.

202
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:43,458
Helen winston..

203
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,694
Two weeks ago, decided
to put on a pair of fins

204
00:13:46,798 --> 00:13:49,064
and ends up snorkeling in
freshly-poured concrete.

205
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:51,281
You said varga was
a contract killer.

206
00:13:51,468 --> 00:13:54,211
And tom larsen was
accused of murder.

207
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,818
What about the other two?

208
00:13:55,866 --> 00:13:58,985
Nobody in witness protection
program is a model citizen.

209
00:13:59,115 --> 00:14:03,495
To know enough to be worth flipping
and protecting, you gotta be dirty.

210
00:14:04,223 --> 00:14:06,628
Looks like maybe we got a neuro
who's playing for the right team.

211
00:14:06,681 --> 00:14:09,229
How's this neuro getting this
classified information?

212
00:14:09,242 --> 00:14:12,123
If we could figure this out,
we can track him down.

213
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:13,556
So good luck.

214
00:14:13,637 --> 00:14:15,163
Bring up varga again,
will ya?

215
00:14:15,244 --> 00:14:16,682
Alright.

216
00:14:22,383 --> 00:14:26,283
Tell lisa i'll take her to the soccer
game saturday if i don't have to work...

217
00:14:27,469 --> 00:14:28,856
I gotta go.

218
00:14:28,946 --> 00:14:30,546
I'm heading into
the basement...

219
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:32,009
No signal.

220
00:14:33,135 --> 00:14:34,935
I know, we'll talk
about it tonight.

221
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,510
Look, i have to hang up.

222
00:14:36,607 --> 00:14:37,761
I'll call you right back.

223
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:11,567
Hey, sheila.

224
00:15:11,672 --> 00:15:14,087
Hey, you're working
late today.

225
00:15:14,226 --> 00:15:15,401
Case file.

226
00:15:15,484 --> 00:15:19,034
But one of these days i just might
come down just to take you to lunch.

227
00:15:19,909 --> 00:15:21,563
The file, officer cook.

228
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:27,323
Just punch the deposit ticket
and you're on your way.

229
00:15:31,421 --> 00:15:32,278
See ya.

230
00:15:32,382 --> 00:15:33,608
Okay.

231
00:15:40,733 --> 00:15:43,310
Yeah, i've got signal.

232
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,490
So let's talk about
the kids' schedule...

233
00:16:37,727 --> 00:16:38,866
Andre's looking for you.

234
00:16:39,043 --> 00:16:40,643
Riley's pulled
some other files.

235
00:16:40,981 --> 00:16:41,981
More dirtbags.

236
00:16:42,728 --> 00:16:46,103
Two other suicide hits
and some possibles.

237
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,687
Then i say we
keep out of it.

238
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:48,993
That's not your call.

239
00:16:49,063 --> 00:16:50,291
Maybe it should be.

240
00:16:50,358 --> 00:16:51,429
We offer these
guys protection

241
00:16:51,475 --> 00:16:53,128
for turning
state's evidence.

242
00:16:53,232 --> 00:16:54,192
But the guy who's
hunting them down,

243
00:16:54,226 --> 00:16:55,780
we're supposed
to go after him!

244
00:16:56,043 --> 00:16:57,040
Him?

245
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:58,441
We're talking
about a neuro.

246
00:16:58,853 --> 00:16:59,853
I know that.

247
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:01,106
But instead of
chipping him,

248
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,757
maybe we should
give him a medal.

249
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,102
What happened to
"everything by the book?"

250
00:17:05,142 --> 00:17:06,169
you used
to get on my back

251
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,259
for talking just
the way you are.

252
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,259
The damn book put tom
larsen out on the street.

253
00:17:09,303 --> 00:17:10,660
And who knows
how many more.

254
00:17:11,324 --> 00:17:13,259
Your reward
for testifying, mr. Larsen...

255
00:17:13,328 --> 00:17:16,068
A new name and a new city
where nobody knows to run

256
00:17:16,115 --> 00:17:18,080
the other way when
they see you coming.

257
00:17:18,314 --> 00:17:20,603
This isn't just
about tom.

258
00:17:20,892 --> 00:17:22,325
Easy for you to say.

259
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:24,129
No, actually, it's not.

260
00:17:24,256 --> 00:17:26,881
Mo, whoever's doing this
thinks he can dole out

261
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:29,158
the death penalty
to anyone he wants.

262
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:33,251
Alright, this week you
like his choices.

263
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,794
What happens next
week when you don't?

264
00:17:38,217 --> 00:17:39,911
You're starting
to sound like me.

265
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:41,737
Frightening, isn't it?

266
00:18:07,677 --> 00:18:10,310
How's it going
pinpointing possibles?

267
00:18:11,979 --> 00:18:12,754
This guy doesn't seem
to be going

268
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,232
after embezzlers
or drug pushers...

269
00:18:16,043 --> 00:18:17,042
Just killers.

270
00:18:18,546 --> 00:18:22,046
I reduced the target sample from
friggin' huge to merely unmanageable.

271
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:26,592
Riley, if you're able to hit
this thing, someone else could.

272
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,897
Is there any way to find out if someone
else has sniffed this database

273
00:18:28,944 --> 00:18:30,067
Someone from the outside?

274
00:18:30,368 --> 00:18:33,016
Boss,
do you have to ask?

275
00:18:37,102 --> 00:18:39,975
Alright, let's do this.

276
00:18:50,440 --> 00:19:00,309
Gregory hazen, raleigh
county, file number 41471103-ae

277
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,598
Current identity

278
00:19:03,223 --> 00:19:04,996
marty lento.

279
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,913
Gregory hazen,
aka marty lento.

280
00:19:13,931 --> 00:19:15,935
Seems our perp has been
using the same source

281
00:19:15,992 --> 00:19:18,388
to get access into the
witness protection files.

282
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:21,026
I know where that
source is but not who.

283
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,145
Here's the thing.

284
00:19:23,176 --> 00:19:26,771
Lento's file was pulled 12
hours ago from that same source.

285
00:19:27,301 --> 00:19:28,851
You think he's
our next target?

286
00:19:29,362 --> 00:19:30,610
I wouldn't count him out.

287
00:19:30,674 --> 00:19:31,911
Can you get
me an address?

288
00:19:32,112 --> 00:19:32,862
Does a bear...

289
00:19:32,892 --> 00:19:34,780
Just let me have it.

290
00:19:36,946 --> 00:19:39,251
And a tail on lento
might be nice.

291
00:23:12,288 --> 00:23:13,432
He's hallucinating.

292
00:23:13,869 --> 00:23:14,869
Yeah.

293
00:23:15,371 --> 00:23:16,521
We're invisible to him.

294
00:23:17,745 --> 00:23:18,745
She's sweet.

295
00:23:19,682 --> 00:23:21,432
Made less than
a hundred that year.

296
00:23:21,996 --> 00:23:23,444
Must be worth a fortune.

297
00:23:24,764 --> 00:23:25,865
How's she run?

298
00:23:25,967 --> 00:23:30,033
Eats gas but purrs
like a kitten.

299
00:23:50,628 --> 00:23:52,458
Boss,
why don't we jump him.

300
00:23:52,551 --> 00:23:55,528
Easy connor,
might lead us to the source.

301
00:24:49,533 --> 00:24:51,316
Maybe he lost
a contact lens.

302
00:24:51,926 --> 00:24:52,926
Shhh!

303
00:25:11,789 --> 00:25:13,167
Lento!

304
00:25:13,248 --> 00:25:14,303
Lento!

305
00:25:15,238 --> 00:25:16,238
Get out of there!

306
00:25:26,927 --> 00:25:27,926
Shut it down!

307
00:25:28,004 --> 00:25:28,926
How?!!!

308
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,927
Where?!!!

309
00:25:31,179 --> 00:25:33,953
Maureen, shut it down!

310
00:25:34,602 --> 00:25:36,188
They had him
on murder charges!

311
00:25:36,246 --> 00:25:37,544
Killer from chicago.

312
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:38,614
Witness protection...

313
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,383
You gotta be dirty.

314
00:25:41,994 --> 00:25:44,951
Maureen, push
the damn button!!!

315
00:25:49,469 --> 00:25:51,959
Mo! You've
got to do this.

316
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:55,910
Maureen, shut
the damn thing down!!!

317
00:26:08,103 --> 00:26:09,084
Jane !

318
00:26:16,504 --> 00:26:17,504
Jane!

319
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:19,806
Is she okay?

320
00:26:19,904 --> 00:26:20,898
She's alive.

321
00:26:23,808 --> 00:26:25,636
I wish i wasn't.

322
00:26:25,722 --> 00:26:27,966
Just shoot me and put
me out of my misery.

323
00:26:28,177 --> 00:26:29,281
As if that would help.

324
00:26:29,404 --> 00:26:30,523
Let's get you out of here.

325
00:26:30,593 --> 00:26:31,934
I'm so sorry.

326
00:26:32,793 --> 00:26:35,713
Connor, debrief him.

327
00:26:35,992 --> 00:26:37,137
I want full details.

328
00:26:37,365 --> 00:26:38,465
What the hell is this?

329
00:26:39,802 --> 00:26:40,802
What is this place?

330
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:43,740
It came pretty close to being
the end of you, pal.

331
00:26:43,785 --> 00:26:44,739
I don't understand...

332
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:45,740
Talk to me.

333
00:26:46,554 --> 00:26:47,804
You came in on the train.

334
00:26:48,243 --> 00:26:49,893
Tell me what you
thought you saw.

335
00:26:50,291 --> 00:26:52,116
A car auction..

336
00:26:53,481 --> 00:26:55,113
With these cool cars.

337
00:26:55,243 --> 00:26:56,990
That's what you saw,
a car auction?

338
00:26:57,101 --> 00:26:58,242
Of course.

339
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:03,615
I was talking to this guy
about a corvett, but..

340
00:27:05,421 --> 00:27:06,421
What?

341
00:27:09,233 --> 00:27:12,925
It's okay, it's okay,
let's get you out of here.

342
00:27:26,826 --> 00:27:27,861
What's happening to me?

343
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:28,862
Do you know...

344
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,173
What i don't know
could fill a book.

345
00:27:30,219 --> 00:27:31,474
Just be glad you're alive.

346
00:27:38,753 --> 00:27:40,863
Looks like our perp
changed his m. o.

347
00:27:42,893 --> 00:27:45,003
Gregory hazen a. k.a.
Marty lento

348
00:27:45,052 --> 00:27:48,353
wasn't a murderer-
not even a criminal.

349
00:27:48,439 --> 00:27:49,674
You're right, riley.

350
00:27:49,797 --> 00:27:51,862
Gregory hazen was
a defense attorney.

351
00:27:52,487 --> 00:27:53,487
Affirmative.

352
00:27:55,612 --> 00:27:56,730
What are you saying?

353
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,141
De-fense a-torn-ey.

354
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:01,442
3
- piece suit, attache case, "i object, your honor. "

355
00:28:01,528 --> 00:28:02,755
that's not possible!

356
00:28:02,902 --> 00:28:03,908
What's your problem?

357
00:28:04,409 --> 00:28:07,114
What the hell's an attorney
doing in witness protection?

358
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:10,636
Remember the robert
grant trial?

359
00:28:10,795 --> 00:28:12,470
Guy who murdered
his wife and kids?

360
00:28:12,783 --> 00:28:14,513
Police botched
the evidence,

361
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:18,410
hazen made a big deal
about it, grant walked.

362
00:28:18,729 --> 00:28:20,140
Death threats?

363
00:28:20,409 --> 00:28:21,709
Hazen got more
than grant.

364
00:28:22,889 --> 00:28:25,145
Guess the police decided
he needed protection.

365
00:28:26,096 --> 00:28:27,960
I almost let
that man die.

366
00:28:29,628 --> 00:28:31,040
He is an attorney.

367
00:28:32,035 --> 00:28:33,385
Lotta gray
lines out there.

368
00:28:37,873 --> 00:28:39,396
And i crossed
all of them.

369
00:28:48,106 --> 00:28:49,359
This is interesting.

370
00:28:50,167 --> 00:28:51,167
You think so?

371
00:28:51,234 --> 00:28:52,384
You shoulda been there.

372
00:28:53,543 --> 00:28:54,593
Let me try something.

373
00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:01,669
Ah!!

374
00:29:01,981 --> 00:29:04,681
Increased tensile strength
in the newly healed tissue.

375
00:29:05,566 --> 00:29:06,720
Ah!

376
00:29:06,781 --> 00:29:08,241
That's cold!

377
00:29:08,511 --> 00:29:09,333
Really, hein?

378
00:29:10,256 --> 00:29:11,256
What about here?

379
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:13,945
Here?

380
00:29:15,692 --> 00:29:16,692
And here?

381
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:20,523
Increased sensitivity.

382
00:29:22,758 --> 00:29:24,908
Well, you're poking
pretty hard there, doc.

383
00:29:26,381 --> 00:29:28,581
Actually, i'm exerting
very little pressure.

384
00:29:29,445 --> 00:29:31,495
Has this occurred
with previous injuries?

385
00:29:34,385 --> 00:29:37,489
To be honest,
i don't recall.

386
00:29:38,238 --> 00:29:40,934
Well, it's something to look
out for in the future.

387
00:29:41,791 --> 00:29:46,306
This phenomenon could explain
the intense pain you reported.

388
00:29:46,382 --> 00:29:49,999
You started healiwhilthe laser was still
cutting you,

389
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:52,070
and the fresh tissue
was hypersensitive.

390
00:29:52,163 --> 00:29:53,813
All i know is, it
hurt like hell.

391
00:29:56,061 --> 00:29:57,912
Sorry, You can put this on.

392
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:00,015
Your shirt's
pretty much toast.

393
00:30:02,763 --> 00:30:07,082
Promise me you'll
report any changes.

394
00:30:07,162 --> 00:30:10,162
Chills or hot flashes, unusual
cravings, that sort of thing.

395
00:30:12,163 --> 00:30:13,455
Pickles and ice cream?

396
00:30:15,102 --> 00:30:19,711
Cravings can be the body's way
of signaling a chemical process.

397
00:30:19,788 --> 00:30:22,838
Excess potassium, iron deficiency,
it's all medical evidence.

398
00:30:23,479 --> 00:30:27,285
I promise,
if there are any changes,

399
00:30:27,728 --> 00:30:29,278
you'll be the first
one i call.

400
00:30:48,789 --> 00:30:50,597
What'd you get
out of lento?

401
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:52,589
Guy thought he was at
a car auction.

402
00:30:53,225 --> 00:30:55,224
So he was experiencing
a persistent vision

403
00:30:55,296 --> 00:30:57,625
of another environment,
leading him into danger.

404
00:30:58,478 --> 00:30:59,289
Sounds right.

405
00:30:59,373 --> 00:31:02,090
But he had no idea how it
happened or who's responsible.

406
00:31:02,664 --> 00:31:04,220
Just another dead end.

407
00:31:04,351 --> 00:31:05,348
Maybe not.

408
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:07,912
We might've found a way to
come at it from the inside.

409
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:08,913
How?

410
00:31:08,977 --> 00:31:11,582
Case officer in witness
protection, name of downing.

411
00:31:12,097 --> 00:31:16,073
All the case files of the recents victims have been
accessed from downing's account.

412
00:31:17,472 --> 00:31:18,775
You saying he's our neuro?

413
00:31:19,726 --> 00:31:22,076
Or an information leak
that leads to our neuro.

414
00:31:23,791 --> 00:31:24,791
How you doing?

415
00:31:25,289 --> 00:31:26,162
Peachy.

416
00:31:26,212 --> 00:31:26,801
Good.

417
00:31:26,853 --> 00:31:28,665
Connor, i need you
to check on downing.

418
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,666
You got it.

419
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:56,661
Alright brainiac, your override
code worked, i'm in downing's office.

420
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:57,961
Glad you made it big guy.

421
00:31:58,366 --> 00:31:59,422
You can thank me later.

422
00:32:00,796 --> 00:32:03,049
See if the same code
works on the database?

423
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,550
Riley! These guys
have our intel.

424
00:32:21,784 --> 00:32:24,287
There's a detailed map of
our layout here, riley.

425
00:32:24,385 --> 00:32:25,281
According to this..

426
00:32:25,336 --> 00:32:27,170
They are going to strike-
ahhhh!!!!!!

427
00:32:28,299 --> 00:32:28,974
Who are you?!!

428
00:32:28,999 --> 00:32:29,968
Get down!!!!

429
00:32:30,042 --> 00:32:31,450
Connor, get back here!!!!

430
00:32:31,548 --> 00:32:32,358
What the hell is going on?

431
00:32:32,394 --> 00:32:34,345
Talk to me what's happening?

432
00:32:34,394 --> 00:32:35,204
Riley!!!!

433
00:33:26,055 --> 00:33:27,254
Hey, connor.

434
00:33:33,622 --> 00:33:34,864
Are you okay, lad?

435
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,358
Connor!

436
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,278
Connor!

437
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:42,490
Connor!

438
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,680
Vasco!!!

439
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:20,784
Connor, what are
you doing, man?!!!!

440
00:34:37,132 --> 00:34:38,445
Why!!!!!

441
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:40,430
Hold your fire!!!!

442
00:35:01,745 --> 00:35:03,045
Agent king,
cease fire!!!!

443
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:16,404
Andre, get down!!!

444
00:35:27,075 --> 00:35:28,486
Connor,

445
00:35:44,213 --> 00:35:46,961
it's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

446
00:35:49,501 --> 00:35:50,876
It's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

447
00:35:50,959 --> 00:35:52,153
Connor, it's me!!!

448
00:35:52,259 --> 00:35:54,517
It's jane, it's jane!!!

449
00:36:02,398 --> 00:36:03,891
It's okay, it's okay.

450
00:36:05,215 --> 00:36:06,215
Shhh!!

451
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:10,680
The s. o.b.
Got into my head.

452
00:36:14,842 --> 00:36:16,661
We seem to be dealing with
a neuro who can induce

453
00:36:16,759 --> 00:36:18,991
persistent visual
hallucinations in his victims.

454
00:36:19,827 --> 00:36:22,355
Well, it's gotta
be downing or burstyn.

455
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:24,230
Who the hell is burstyn?

456
00:36:24,534 --> 00:36:25,528
Or downing
for that matter.

457
00:36:25,602 --> 00:36:28,268
The "privacy police" guy.

458
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:29,344
Domestic terrorist.

459
00:36:29,393 --> 00:36:31,798
I tracked it from
downing's office...

460
00:36:31,957 --> 00:36:34,326
Riley, these guys
have our intel.

461
00:36:38,081 --> 00:36:39,728
Never happened,
did it?

462
00:36:40,807 --> 00:36:41,830
Connor.

463
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,507
Last time we saw you,

464
00:36:43,582 --> 00:36:45,382
we left you
to question marty lento.

465
00:36:45,576 --> 00:36:47,676
Next thing, you were
in here, guns blazing.

466
00:36:47,765 --> 00:36:49,370
Neuro must have gotten to
you back at the factory.

467
00:36:49,456 --> 00:36:50,683
When you left with marty.

468
00:36:52,701 --> 00:36:54,101
You see anybody
else around?

469
00:36:55,765 --> 00:36:57,165
You're asking
me what i saw?

470
00:36:58,635 --> 00:36:59,776
Bad idea.

471
00:37:01,642 --> 00:37:04,340
I feel like
i need a shower.

472
00:37:22,497 --> 00:37:23,637
Son of a bitch.

473
00:37:25,012 --> 00:37:26,012
It almost worked.

474
00:37:27,012 --> 00:37:28,012
Almost.

475
00:37:29,515 --> 00:37:31,912
If it wasn't for jane and
her freakazoid healing,

476
00:37:31,913 --> 00:37:33,263
i'd have killed
all of you.

477
00:37:34,551 --> 00:37:36,061
Hey, listen..

478
00:37:36,827 --> 00:37:39,536
I need you to get your
head back in the game.

479
00:37:39,818 --> 00:37:40,885
The real game.

480
00:37:41,637 --> 00:37:44,358
Whoever did this,
they could try it again.

481
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:46,750
We to take him down
before that happens, okay?

482
00:37:49,987 --> 00:37:52,735
Then i'm the answer
to your prayers.

483
00:37:54,328 --> 00:37:56,128
Got this off of
real-time satellite.

484
00:37:56,833 --> 00:37:58,293
What're we looking at?

485
00:37:58,387 --> 00:38:00,587
Connor coming out of
the factory with lento.

486
00:38:01,451 --> 00:38:04,624
That's connor and
lento right there.

487
00:38:04,784 --> 00:38:05,925
Now watch.

488
00:38:08,759 --> 00:38:09,913
You saying
that's our neuro?

489
00:38:09,974 --> 00:38:11,186
No one else in the area.

490
00:38:11,235 --> 00:38:14,204
I ran thermo scans, ultra-green,
i even went so far as to...

491
00:38:14,254 --> 00:38:15,616
You i. d. Him yet?

492
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:18,499
Ruben hennesy.

493
00:38:18,695 --> 00:38:21,976
Currently employed as
a janitor at 10 police plaza.

494
00:38:22,013 --> 00:38:23,013
He's an attorney.

495
00:38:23,138 --> 00:38:24,888
Graduated stanford
law with honors.

496
00:38:25,203 --> 00:38:26,202
Attorney to janitor.

497
00:38:27,043 --> 00:38:28,037
Helluva career move.

498
00:38:28,202 --> 00:38:29,602
The question
is why make it?

499
00:38:30,638 --> 00:38:33,038
Hennesy's been at ten-p
for the last six months.

500
00:38:33,578 --> 00:38:35,193
His nineteen year-old
daughter was murdered

501
00:38:35,194 --> 00:38:37,257
a year and a half ago
by a three-strike offender

502
00:38:37,258 --> 00:38:39,358
who should've been
behind bars but wasn't.

503
00:38:39,605 --> 00:38:42,168
Was turned over and relocated
by witness protection.

504
00:38:42,477 --> 00:38:44,043
Makes him look
good for it, huh?

505
00:38:44,384 --> 00:38:46,727
You think he's trying to make
up for what happened to his kid?

506
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,580
If he is our man, he
might've started that way.

507
00:38:48,629 --> 00:38:51,283
But now it looks like he's
prepared to kill anyone...

508
00:38:51,451 --> 00:38:53,926
...including us, to
protect his secret.

509
00:38:54,069 --> 00:38:55,068
How the hell do we get
close enough to chip a guy

510
00:38:55,153 --> 00:38:57,169
who can pull this kinda
crap in our heads?

511
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:00,320
The man can make us see
anything he wants to.

512
00:39:01,324 --> 00:39:04,711
Maybe we can make him
see what we want him to.

513
00:39:10,833 --> 00:39:12,944
Members of a covert,
federal law enforcement

514
00:39:12,981 --> 00:39:15,944
unit were gunned down today in
a bizarre underground firefight.

515
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,745
Apparently a disgruntled
team member

516
00:39:17,802 --> 00:39:20,381
turned his weapons on his
colleagues, before killing himself.

517
00:39:20,514 --> 00:39:23,336
The gunman has been
identified as connor king.

518
00:39:23,445 --> 00:39:25,068
The mayor's office has
assured the public

519
00:39:25,152 --> 00:39:26,774
that this incident will be
thoroughly investigated.

520
00:39:32,013 --> 00:39:34,075
Not... Yet.

521
00:39:35,134 --> 00:39:36,134
Confused, right?

522
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:37,510
I'm dead.

523
00:39:37,885 --> 00:39:40,573
So just keep on doing
what you were doing.

524
00:39:40,696 --> 00:39:41,746
Pretend i'm not here.

525
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:44,510
Or am i?

526
00:39:49,133 --> 00:39:51,391
Seeing is believing,
isn't it?

527
00:39:57,386 --> 00:39:59,719
Thought you were the only
one who could play this game?

528
00:39:59,791 --> 00:40:00,920
Welcome to my nightmare.

529
00:40:03,344 --> 00:40:05,864
You stay out of my head!

530
00:40:14,838 --> 00:40:16,052
What did you do?

531
00:40:16,131 --> 00:40:17,647
Changed your mind.

532
00:40:17,756 --> 00:40:19,256
About changing
peoples' minds.

533
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:25,082
You know those people
got what they deserved.

534
00:40:25,132 --> 00:40:27,032
You know what kind
of people they are.

535
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,075
We do.

536
00:40:28,132 --> 00:40:29,507
The type of person
you've become.

537
00:40:29,557 --> 00:40:30,508
Get him outta here.

538
00:40:30,568 --> 00:40:31,568
Let's go!

539
00:40:34,133 --> 00:40:35,133
Good work.

540
00:40:35,444 --> 00:40:36,644
Can i quote you on that?

541
00:40:36,885 --> 00:40:38,219
I'd only deny it.

542
00:41:08,937 --> 00:41:11,171
You've been bringing people
here for five years?

543
00:41:11,244 --> 00:41:12,991
Some of 'em don't
make it this far.

544
00:41:14,365 --> 00:41:15,365
They all come here.

545
00:41:15,526 --> 00:41:17,241
The live ones
get new housing.

546
00:41:17,318 --> 00:41:19,128
The others go
straight to the lab.

547
00:41:20,365 --> 00:41:21,551
What happens in the lab?

548
00:41:21,589 --> 00:41:22,552
I don't ask.

549
00:41:35,492 --> 00:41:36,942
Mcbride, vasco,
king, bowers.

550
00:41:37,241 --> 00:41:38,991
We're here to see
to ruben hennesy.

551
00:41:43,656 --> 00:41:45,329
I don't have
that name here.

552
00:41:45,677 --> 00:41:46,677
He's an inmate.

553
00:41:46,742 --> 00:41:47,680
Recent admit.

554
00:41:47,742 --> 00:41:48,417
Got to debrief him.

555
00:41:48,515 --> 00:41:52,235
Make sure the security of my
team has not been compromised.

556
00:41:52,554 --> 00:41:54,297
Agent mcbride, i'm
sorry i can't help you.

557
00:41:54,395 --> 00:41:57,026
That detaine has been
transferred to another facility.

558
00:41:57,202 --> 00:41:58,202
Let me see that.

559
00:42:02,262 --> 00:42:04,829
All the authorizations
are correct.

560
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:06,571
But that's impossible.

561
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:10,818
My mistake,
we'll just look around.

562
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:11,764
What's the problem?

563
00:42:11,849 --> 00:42:13,386
We can go talk to hennesy
at the other facility.

564
00:42:13,444 --> 00:42:14,887
There is no
'other facility. '

565
00:42:15,515 --> 00:42:16,965
at least, there
shouldn't be.

566
00:42:19,763 --> 00:42:21,262
I'm beginning to learn.

567
00:42:21,326 --> 00:42:24,076
A secret isn't always something
you choose not to tell.

568
00:42:30,139 --> 00:42:32,476
Even the most open
people may not be aware

569
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:34,075
that they have
things to hide.

570
00:42:36,827 --> 00:42:40,058
I rember my dad once
telling me that a secret

571
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,540
may simply be
the difference

572
00:42:41,627 --> 00:42:43,726
between what appears
on the outside...

573
00:42:43,787 --> 00:42:46,179
and what really is!

574
00:42:47,200 --> 00:43:47,200
