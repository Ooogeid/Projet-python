00:00:06,101 --> 00:00:07,099
When I was little

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,266
my dad called me
his "painkiller Jane".

3
00:00:09,849 --> 00:00:12,349
Whenever I got hurt,
I made the pain go away.

4
00:00:13,977 --> 00:00:15,477
Only I didn't
just bury it.

5
00:00:16,037 --> 00:00:17,092
Or push it aside...

6
00:00:20,912 --> 00:00:22,523
...I pretty much murdered it.

7
00:00:40,598 --> 00:00:43,375
Afterwards, I'd go to
a peaceful place in my mind.

8
00:00:46,412 --> 00:00:48,023
I called it
the emerald city.

9
00:00:48,724 --> 00:00:50,279
Partly because
it was green.

10
00:00:50,536 --> 00:00:52,702
Mostly because
I could only dream about

11
00:00:52,974 --> 00:00:54,418
what magic
must be inside.

12
00:00:56,599 --> 00:00:58,599
It was my way of
controlling a world

13
00:00:59,035 --> 00:01:00,368
that was out of control.

15
00:01:17,727 --> 00:01:18,536
Hello.

16
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:21,814
Report to security on floor 1-14
take the express elevator.

17
00:01:23,601 --> 00:01:25,601
Control can be
a dangerous illusion.

18
00:01:26,036 --> 00:01:29,258
There are some things you have
absolutely no control over.

19
00:01:36,787 --> 00:01:38,675
Gravity being one
of the big ones.

20
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,997
If you thought I was
having a bad day then,

21
00:01:52,107 --> 00:01:53,940
four days earlier
was even worse.

22
00:01:55,168 --> 00:01:56,168
Confused?

23
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:58,170
So was I.

24
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:09,045
A new designer drug
had started circulating

25
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:10,046
through the clubs.

26
00:02:10,232 --> 00:02:12,291
Maureen and I were hoping
we'd score that night.

27
00:02:12,292 --> 00:02:13,458
Maureen's my partner.

28
00:02:13,856 --> 00:02:14,856
As d.e.a. Agents,

29
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,291
we'd been working
this case for three weeks.

30
00:02:17,292 --> 00:02:18,417
If we'd done it my way,

31
00:02:18,418 --> 00:02:20,041
we'd made
the bust two weeks ago.

32
00:02:20,042 --> 00:02:21,597
Only we didn't do it
my way.

33
00:02:21,788 --> 00:02:24,293
We've got enough on those two guys
to ask some serious questions.

34
00:02:24,294 --> 00:02:25,516
No buy, no bust, Jane.

35
00:02:27,102 --> 00:02:29,268
And one more day
in her borrowed heels,

36
00:02:29,289 --> 00:02:30,789
I'd be limping permanently.

37
00:02:32,476 --> 00:02:33,642
We play by the rules.

38
00:03:06,397 --> 00:03:08,452
I got samples, you brought the money?

39
00:03:10,327 --> 00:03:11,327
Be ready.

40
00:03:11,952 --> 00:03:12,952
What do you think?

41
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:24,228
You said you wanted
to play by the rules.

42
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,638
Looks like they've
just been broken.

43
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:27,639
Take the ugly one.

44
00:03:27,704 --> 00:03:28,704
Wait...

45
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:37,641
...come back later

46
00:03:38,076 --> 00:03:39,131
d.e.a. Hands up!!!!

47
00:04:02,895 --> 00:04:03,895
Don't move!

48
00:04:04,522 --> 00:04:06,799
Usually, they like it
when I do, darlin'.

49
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:08,869
You're not going
anywhere, pal!

50
00:04:09,584 --> 00:04:10,584
D.e.a. Freeze!

51
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:13,208
Hands up!

52
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,520
Hands up!

53
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:18,333
Hands up!

54
00:04:28,584 --> 00:04:29,972
...what the hell is this?

55
00:04:31,834 --> 00:04:32,834
Listen to me.

56
00:04:33,522 --> 00:04:34,771
My name is
Andre Mcbride.

57
00:04:34,772 --> 00:04:36,049
I'm a government agent.

58
00:04:36,144 --> 00:04:37,421
We're on
the same team.

59
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:39,145
I'm sure.

60
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:42,207
I don't think you're sure
of anything right now.

61
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:43,207
And a bad shooting...

62
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:44,208
Shut up!

63
00:04:44,273 --> 00:04:46,647
The man beside me is producing
a hallucination.

64
00:04:46,648 --> 00:04:48,122
You cannot trust
what you're seeing.

65
00:04:48,143 --> 00:04:49,922
You sure you can believe
what you're hearing

66
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,604
any more than what
you're seeing?

67
00:04:51,647 --> 00:04:53,091
He's a genetic aberration.

68
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:55,770
We've all got
our problems.

69
00:04:55,771 --> 00:04:57,332
Right now, this is
your problem.

70
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,020
He's doing this to gain
time and confuse you.

71
00:04:59,021 --> 00:05:00,798
Well he's doing
a damn good job.

72
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,249
The man beside me
is going to kill you.

73
00:05:08,145 --> 00:05:09,145
He's lying.

74
00:05:30,771 --> 00:05:31,771
No.

75
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,333
Easy.

76
00:05:34,895 --> 00:05:36,395
I want you to
explain this.

77
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,333
You first.

78
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,457
How did you know
I was telling the truth?

79
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,180
You're shadow moved,
he didn't.

80
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:47,833
Smart.

81
00:05:48,209 --> 00:05:49,209
Your turn.

82
00:05:50,645 --> 00:05:52,200
What just
happened in here?!

83
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,332
Yeah, nothing on him!

84
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,333
I got it.

85
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:10,769
They cleared you.

86
00:06:11,897 --> 00:06:14,147
Still doesn't say what
branch of the government you work for.

87
00:06:14,335 --> 00:06:15,501
It's not supposed to.

88
00:06:15,896 --> 00:06:17,229
Why'd you come after us?

89
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:18,810
We saw a buy go down.

90
00:06:19,144 --> 00:06:21,396
We've been working this
place for three weeks.

91
00:06:21,397 --> 00:06:22,893
Saw you guys
hanging around.

92
00:06:22,894 --> 00:06:24,769
Didn't look like
your kind of crowd.

93
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,492
I'll take that
as a compliment.

94
00:06:26,646 --> 00:06:27,923
It wasn't meant as one.

95
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:29,916
What happened in there?!

96
00:06:29,933 --> 00:06:31,519
I'm afraid, you'll have
to be content with

97
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,853
"thank you" agent Vasco,

98
00:06:32,898 --> 00:06:34,064
and leave it at that.

99
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:37,644
Hey, you might've checked out
with my supervising officer,

100
00:06:37,645 --> 00:06:40,200
but that doesn't mean
you checked out with me.

101
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,833
The neuro's tagged
and bagged, boss.

102
00:06:48,192 --> 00:06:49,192
Thank you.

103
00:06:54,503 --> 00:06:55,891
You ever hear of
a neuro?

104
00:06:57,443 --> 00:06:58,443
What's a neuro?

105
00:06:58,565 --> 00:06:59,565
No idea.

106
00:07:00,064 --> 00:07:02,685
But it's something we're
not supposed to know about.

107
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,189
You probably
figured out by now

108
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,412
I'm not much of
by-the-book kind of gal.

109
00:07:06,878 --> 00:07:09,440
Which is why invited chuck
in the I.t. Department

110
00:07:09,441 --> 00:07:11,663
for coffee and
a bagel the next morning.

111
00:07:11,818 --> 00:07:13,446
Which is why he agreed
to check out

112
00:07:13,442 --> 00:07:16,386
Andre Mcbride and the d.e.a
mainframe that afternoon,

113
00:07:17,378 --> 00:07:18,065
which is why

114
00:07:18,066 --> 00:07:21,252
by the time I was called in
the deputy director's office...

115
00:07:21,253 --> 00:07:22,253
Have a seat.

116
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:23,378
I could have sworn

117
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:25,712
the bagel was still sitting
in my stomach.

118
00:07:32,065 --> 00:07:35,565
Your current investigation has
been terminated by the director.

119
00:07:37,253 --> 00:07:38,127
Why?

120
00:07:38,128 --> 00:07:40,850
She chose not to share
that with me, agent Vasco.

121
00:07:41,941 --> 00:07:44,378
I do know your entire
service record has been

122
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:45,934
red-flagged by the Pentagon.

123
00:08:18,927 --> 00:08:20,649
You tried to hack
our database.

124
00:08:20,742 --> 00:08:23,075
I don't do well with
unanswered questions.

125
00:08:23,927 --> 00:08:25,371
Well, life's full of them.

126
00:08:27,427 --> 00:08:28,427
What do you want?

127
00:08:29,115 --> 00:08:30,115
You.

128
00:08:31,676 --> 00:08:32,676
Now?

129
00:08:32,864 --> 00:08:33,864
Up here?

130
00:08:34,991 --> 00:08:37,238
Your school records
indicated you were suspended

131
00:08:37,239 --> 00:08:39,183
22 times over
the four-year period.

132
00:08:39,988 --> 00:08:42,432
That's a lie,
it was twenty-three, actually.

133
00:08:44,801 --> 00:08:46,489
Reasons included
everything from fighting

134
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:49,045
and swearing to feigning
an epileptic seizure.

135
00:08:50,116 --> 00:08:50,989
Yeah.

136
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:51,990
My bad.

137
00:08:52,427 --> 00:08:54,862
Hospital records show
that when they refused

138
00:08:54,863 --> 00:08:56,740
to let you visit
your dying mother,

139
00:08:56,741 --> 00:09:00,018
a nurse found you holding her
in the middle of the night...

140
00:09:00,926 --> 00:09:03,926
Somehow you've been living
in her room for three days.

141
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,920
I'm done here.

142
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:11,046
I know what makes
you tick, agent Vasco.

143
00:09:11,047 --> 00:09:13,102
And I know you think
outside the box.

144
00:09:13,171 --> 00:09:15,172
If you didn't,
I wouldn't have survived.

145
00:09:15,173 --> 00:09:16,506
If that's a thank-you...

146
00:09:17,294 --> 00:09:18,294
It is.

147
00:09:20,171 --> 00:09:21,671
I could use you
on my team.

148
00:09:22,609 --> 00:09:24,668
Only I don't know what
your team does, do I?

149
00:09:24,669 --> 00:09:26,113
Well, that's the catch-22.

150
00:09:27,922 --> 00:09:29,866
Can't tell you
until you're aboard.

151
00:09:30,918 --> 00:09:34,195
I'm more the kind of girl you
have to take to dinner first.

152
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:37,495
The work is unlike anything
you've ever done before.

153
00:09:37,669 --> 00:09:39,113
And we call our own shots.

154
00:09:40,482 --> 00:09:42,370
Everyone's accountable
to someone.

155
00:09:42,732 --> 00:09:44,509
You'd only be
accountable to me.

156
00:09:47,106 --> 00:09:48,106
Military.

157
00:09:49,044 --> 00:09:51,432
You have that "I love
the chain of command"

158
00:09:52,172 --> 00:09:53,172
charm about you.

159
00:09:54,982 --> 00:09:56,759
Seven years with
special forces.

160
00:09:57,106 --> 00:09:58,717
Well, I appreciate
the offer.

161
00:10:01,795 --> 00:10:03,128
Whatever the hell it is.

162
00:10:13,724 --> 00:10:14,724
Careful.

163
00:10:15,163 --> 00:10:17,224
Even in my own shoes,
I can't put one foot

164
00:10:17,225 --> 00:10:18,447
in front of the other.

165
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,412
One request,
agent Vasco...

166
00:10:23,474 --> 00:10:26,349
Since you've now decided
to stay out of our business,

167
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,738
stay out of our business.

168
00:11:47,536 --> 00:11:48,536
doc... Doc...

169
00:11:50,574 --> 00:11:52,337
- Where do you want these?
- Just there.

170
00:12:01,213 --> 00:12:03,657
Intruders approaching
from the north tunnel!

171
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:06,089
Go!!

172
00:12:06,586 --> 00:12:07,464
Riley, how many?!!

173
00:12:07,465 --> 00:12:08,087
Two!

174
00:12:08,088 --> 00:12:08,964
Proximity!

175
00:12:08,965 --> 00:12:09,711
Fifteen meters!

176
00:12:09,712 --> 00:12:10,774
How'd they get through!

177
00:12:10,775 --> 00:12:12,997
I don't know but I think
they're armed!!

178
00:12:13,026 --> 00:12:14,838
I'll cut 'em off
at the subway passage!

179
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:15,713
Ten meters out!

180
00:12:15,714 --> 00:12:17,158
No time, we set up here!!!

181
00:12:21,448 --> 00:12:22,448
They're on us!

182
00:12:34,198 --> 00:12:35,198
Stand down!

183
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:36,553
Put your weapon down!

184
00:12:36,698 --> 00:12:37,864
Don't shoot, it's me!

185
00:12:38,071 --> 00:12:39,071
Show!

186
00:12:42,946 --> 00:12:44,168
Put the gun down now!!

187
00:12:45,196 --> 00:12:46,196
All clear.

188
00:12:57,108 --> 00:12:58,108
Riley, all clear!

189
00:13:10,483 --> 00:13:11,816
She caught me coming in.

190
00:13:15,173 --> 00:13:16,173
Nice place.

191
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,046
Do the decorating
yourself?

192
00:13:22,797 --> 00:13:23,797
Hope you like it.

193
00:13:23,983 --> 00:13:25,547
Now that you've
violated security

194
00:13:25,548 --> 00:13:26,881
and know our location...

195
00:13:27,548 --> 00:13:28,548
It's yours.

196
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:32,932
No, no,
you listen to me,

197
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,753
how can I be reassigned?

198
00:13:40,357 --> 00:13:41,357
Because you can.

199
00:13:42,932 --> 00:13:43,932
What if I say no?

200
00:13:44,058 --> 00:13:46,682
I hear there's an opening
at mielo's department store.

201
00:13:46,683 --> 00:13:47,683
Ladies shoes.

202
00:13:50,306 --> 00:13:52,694
I call the shots in my life,
agent Mcbride.

203
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:56,810
Vasco!

204
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:00,370
How'd you find us?

205
00:14:06,995 --> 00:14:07,995
This!

206
00:14:10,369 --> 00:14:11,535
She tagged you, boss.

207
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:14,719
Careful.

208
00:14:15,282 --> 00:14:16,217
Even in my own shoes,

209
00:14:16,218 --> 00:14:18,592
I can't put one foot
in front of the other.

210
00:14:18,593 --> 00:14:21,204
Looks like I can put one foot
in front of the other after all.

211
00:14:21,593 --> 00:14:22,593
Gentlemen.

212
00:14:46,105 --> 00:14:47,063
Hey, mo.

213
00:14:47,093 --> 00:14:49,823
What the hell's going on?
I heard you got booted from the agency!

214
00:14:49,844 --> 00:14:50,899
I wish I knew, I...

215
00:14:51,158 --> 00:14:52,780
I have no problem taking
first position.

216
00:14:52,781 --> 00:14:53,781
But not this way.

217
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:55,093
I appreciate that.

218
00:14:55,718 --> 00:14:58,358
And I want to go on record that I think
you're getting a bad rap.

219
00:14:58,594 --> 00:15:00,592
You are getting
a bad rap, aren't you?

220
00:15:00,593 --> 00:15:01,469
Maureen...

221
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,970
With the way you do things,

222
00:15:03,093 --> 00:15:05,593
I always knew I'd get
to say "I told you so."

223
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,957
How come I'm not enjoying it.

224
00:15:08,044 --> 00:15:10,592
- What you're talking about?
- Don't screw around with this, Jane.

225
00:15:10,593 --> 00:15:11,593
Get a good lawyer.

226
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,593
When the d.e.a. Files drug
possession charges

227
00:15:13,594 --> 00:15:14,529
against one of their own,

228
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:15,530
it's serious.

229
00:15:17,467 --> 00:15:18,467
Get a good lawyer.

230
00:15:22,146 --> 00:15:23,334
Yeah, yeah, I gotta go.

231
00:15:23,335 --> 00:15:24,668
Thanks for calling, mom.

232
00:15:36,214 --> 00:15:38,158
We both play hardball,
agent Vasco.

233
00:15:38,463 --> 00:15:39,652
And we both play to win.

234
00:15:39,653 --> 00:15:41,837
Even if it means screwing
with someone's life?!

235
00:15:41,838 --> 00:15:44,560
In time, you'll be cleared
of the drug charges...

236
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,069
If you join our team.

237
00:15:49,402 --> 00:15:51,346
That's not much of
a choice, is it?

238
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,900
That was the idea.

239
00:16:00,938 --> 00:16:02,326
Special agent Steve Ford,

240
00:16:03,777 --> 00:16:05,610
communications tech
Riley Jensen,

241
00:16:07,128 --> 00:16:09,516
and you remember special
agent Connor King.

242
00:16:10,814 --> 00:16:11,814
The ugly one.

243
00:16:16,303 --> 00:16:18,691
Joe Waterman ran
operations for the subway.

244
00:16:19,241 --> 00:16:20,852
Before the city
shut it down.

245
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,267
Well most of it anyway.

246
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,910
Hi, I'm dr. Seth Carpenter.

247
00:16:23,975 --> 00:16:26,919
And this is agent Jane Vasco,
formerly of the d.e.a.,

248
00:16:28,098 --> 00:16:30,542
who's graciously consented
to join our team.

249
00:16:31,097 --> 00:16:32,097
Another woman.

250
00:16:32,348 --> 00:16:33,792
She's more than qualified.

251
00:16:33,913 --> 00:16:35,246
If only I knew for what.

252
00:16:39,784 --> 00:16:40,784
We hunt neuros.

253
00:16:40,972 --> 00:16:41,949
Neurological aberrant.

254
00:16:41,977 --> 00:16:44,412
Which is what we were
doing in that club the night we met.

255
00:16:48,223 --> 00:16:49,223
Your partner,

256
00:16:50,162 --> 00:16:51,162
is she straight?

257
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,346
Six years ago
the government became aware

258
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,909
of a genetic aberration
appearing in the population.

259
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,535
Despite their differences,
we've discovered

260
00:16:58,536 --> 00:17:00,702
a definable pattern
in their gene code.

261
00:17:00,909 --> 00:17:02,413
This aberration seems
to affect the

262
00:17:02,414 --> 00:17:03,285
neurological center

263
00:17:03,286 --> 00:17:05,230
of the frontal
and cerebral cortex.

264
00:17:05,473 --> 00:17:07,346
What dr. Carpenter's
means in english,

265
00:17:07,347 --> 00:17:08,722
those with the aberration,

266
00:17:08,723 --> 00:17:11,223
possess a unique ability
to influence others.

267
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:13,051
Like the one in the club.

268
00:17:13,123 --> 00:17:15,784
The one you experienced had
the ability to induce hallucinations.

269
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:17,722
But we've encountered
dozens of variations.

270
00:17:17,723 --> 00:17:18,778
In how many people?

271
00:17:19,287 --> 00:17:20,398
To date, almost 200.

272
00:17:25,972 --> 00:17:27,158
Welcome to the freak show.

273
00:17:27,159 --> 00:17:28,159
What causes it?

274
00:17:31,285 --> 00:17:32,285
Well... Um...

275
00:17:35,098 --> 00:17:36,098
You don't know.

276
00:17:36,724 --> 00:17:37,890
Several possibilities

277
00:17:38,097 --> 00:17:40,033
genetic, environmental,
chemical...

278
00:17:40,034 --> 00:17:42,034
We're still working on
trying to find the source.

279
00:17:42,035 --> 00:17:44,505
The reasons the neuros use
their powers is as varied

280
00:17:44,506 --> 00:17:45,065
as they are.

281
00:17:45,066 --> 00:17:46,690
We think the aberration
interferes with

282
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:47,502
the brain's ability

283
00:17:47,503 --> 00:17:49,280
to distinguish
right from wrong.

284
00:17:49,316 --> 00:17:51,538
You really don't know
that much, do you?

285
00:17:52,379 --> 00:17:54,256
We know they're a pain
in the ass.

286
00:17:54,257 --> 00:17:56,315
Which is why the government
has gone to great lengths

287
00:17:56,316 --> 00:17:59,317
to keep the phenomenon secret
and not panic the public.

288
00:17:59,318 --> 00:18:01,753
We use intel from law
enforcement, and media

289
00:18:01,754 --> 00:18:03,531
first to identify,
then contain.

290
00:18:04,132 --> 00:18:04,878
Contain?

291
00:18:04,879 --> 00:18:05,879
We chip 'em.

292
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:10,254
The micro chip basically
short circuits "the problem."

293
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:12,400
once it penetrates
the epidermis,

294
00:18:12,505 --> 00:18:15,129
nano tech propulsion delivers
it through the bloodstream

295
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,130
to the brain.

296
00:18:22,855 --> 00:18:25,466
Each method of transmission
varies with the op.

297
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,230
Sometimes it's
with this...

298
00:18:28,918 --> 00:18:30,806
Sometimes it's less
conspicuous...

299
00:18:36,169 --> 00:18:37,724
So much for
job orientation.

300
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:42,174
You're a smart girl,
you'll learn the rest as you go.

301
00:18:42,605 --> 00:18:44,993
We've been working this
case for some time.

302
00:18:45,298 --> 00:18:47,421
Someone is dealing
substandard medications

303
00:18:47,422 --> 00:18:48,169
on the black market.

304
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,781
Sounds like
d.e.a. Territory.

305
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:50,607
It was.

306
00:18:50,608 --> 00:18:51,297
Now, it's ours.

307
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:53,794
We're convinced there's
a neuro behind the operation.

308
00:18:53,795 --> 00:18:57,128
The drugs in question are made
and manufactured by vono tek.

309
00:18:59,297 --> 00:19:00,297
The emerald city.

310
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:03,421
It's hard to believe
that the company

311
00:19:03,422 --> 00:19:05,866
would even manufacture
sub-standard product?

312
00:19:06,234 --> 00:19:07,234
They don't.

313
00:19:07,358 --> 00:19:09,420
But about one-tenth of one
percent of every run

314
00:19:09,421 --> 00:19:10,608
fails quality control.

315
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:11,608
Contamination.

316
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,609
A snag in
the manufacturing process.

317
00:19:13,674 --> 00:19:16,234
Expired ingredients that
didn't get scanned properly.

318
00:19:16,235 --> 00:19:18,983
Even that small percentage
amounts to millions of drugs.

319
00:19:18,984 --> 00:19:21,107
Any batch that fails to
pass qc is locked away

320
00:19:21,108 --> 00:19:22,608
and slated for destruction.

321
00:19:22,733 --> 00:19:24,544
In this case, someone's
making an end run

322
00:19:24,545 --> 00:19:26,410
and getting them out,
onto the street.

323
00:19:26,411 --> 00:19:29,244
Obviously, the medications
look like the real deal.

324
00:19:29,348 --> 00:19:31,902
But any unscrupulous pharmacy,
someone trying to cut corners...

325
00:19:32,002 --> 00:19:34,160
There have already been
a dozen deaths

326
00:19:34,161 --> 00:19:35,716
traced directly to vono tek.

327
00:19:36,161 --> 00:19:38,938
Why are you convinced
there's a neuro behind this?

328
00:19:45,162 --> 00:19:47,328
We lost one of our agents
to a "neuro".

329
00:19:52,422 --> 00:19:54,588
Shannon Perry was a member
of our team.

330
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,055
I put her inside
vono tek.

331
00:19:57,862 --> 00:20:00,417
Her first day on the job
she left the building

332
00:20:00,484 --> 00:20:03,039
and calmly stepped
in front of a moving truck.

333
00:20:08,047 --> 00:20:10,213
Women don't last very
long around here.

334
00:20:10,298 --> 00:20:11,921
Is it the sexual
harassment...

335
00:20:11,922 --> 00:20:13,255
...or a size deficiency?

336
00:20:13,923 --> 00:20:15,923
Shannon's psych
record was spotless.

337
00:20:17,297 --> 00:20:18,359
Someone made her do it.

338
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,670
How'd they break
her cover?

339
00:20:19,671 --> 00:20:20,671
We don't know.

340
00:20:20,672 --> 00:20:22,394
She was following
Randall Hyde.

341
00:20:26,711 --> 00:20:28,266
Vono tek's head
of security.

342
00:20:28,899 --> 00:20:31,647
In order to have free
access to vono tek's vaults,

343
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:33,148
the neuro would
have to control Hyde.

344
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:34,426
Unless he is the neuro.

345
00:20:34,523 --> 00:20:35,523
He's clean.

346
00:20:37,337 --> 00:20:38,837
We've taken
tissue samples.

347
00:20:38,899 --> 00:20:42,335
The neuro obviously had to get
close enough to control shannon.

348
00:20:42,336 --> 00:20:43,391
How close is close?

349
00:20:43,899 --> 00:20:44,899
Proximity.

350
00:20:45,151 --> 00:20:47,595
It varies but in order
to control a subject,

351
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:49,272
a neuro would
have to be nearby.

352
00:20:49,273 --> 00:20:50,335
So we need to go back in.

353
00:20:50,336 --> 00:20:51,148
Yes.

354
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:52,149
But not solo.

355
00:20:52,336 --> 00:20:53,836
I want you and
Jane inside.

356
00:20:54,647 --> 00:20:56,898
You can play tag
with Hyde and watch each other's back.

357
00:20:57,899 --> 00:21:00,343
We move quickly here,
Vasco, get used to it.

358
00:21:02,023 --> 00:21:03,411
I hacked human resources.

359
00:21:04,525 --> 00:21:05,969
Most are working tomorrow.

360
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:13,337
Impressive.

361
00:21:15,336 --> 00:21:16,336
You have no idea.

362
00:21:18,212 --> 00:21:20,767
All I can say is be
careful what you wish for.

363
00:21:20,961 --> 00:21:22,516
The thing about
dreams is...

364
00:21:22,586 --> 00:21:24,272
...they can turn into
nightmares faster than

365
00:21:24,273 --> 00:21:25,939
you can click
your high heels.

366
00:21:41,087 --> 00:21:42,920
Report to security
on floor 1-14.

367
00:21:43,648 --> 00:21:45,092
Take the express elevator.

368
00:21:53,962 --> 00:21:55,684
Boss, they've
cleared security,

369
00:21:55,712 --> 00:21:56,823
they're in position.

370
00:22:11,836 --> 00:22:13,558
Blue one's Hyde,
Jane's on him.

371
00:22:43,212 --> 00:22:44,960
He's on the express
elevator to the lobby,

372
00:22:44,961 --> 00:22:47,016
looks like he's
leaving the building.

373
00:22:53,337 --> 00:22:55,225
Entering the express
elevator now.

374
00:23:28,211 --> 00:23:29,397
You said "the lobby",
right?

375
00:23:29,398 --> 00:23:30,398
Yeah.

376
00:23:30,463 --> 00:23:31,209
Hyde wasn't on it.

377
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,210
Had to be on it.

378
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:34,044
There's no where
else to get off.

379
00:23:34,336 --> 00:23:36,280
He has to be still
in the building.

380
00:23:42,398 --> 00:23:44,397
Hyde must be jamming
his security tag.

381
00:23:44,398 --> 00:23:45,085
Wherever he went,

382
00:23:45,086 --> 00:23:46,899
he obviously doesn't
want anyone watching.

383
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,066
Or the neuro doesn't.

384
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:50,461
Yeah.

385
00:23:53,113 --> 00:23:54,113
I can beat it.

386
00:23:54,738 --> 00:23:57,515
The only question is how
long is it going to take.

387
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,050
Got it.

388
00:24:14,363 --> 00:24:16,175
I'm into their climate
control system.

389
00:24:16,176 --> 00:24:18,864
Monitoring Hyde's movement
through his heat signature.

390
00:24:18,865 --> 00:24:19,678
I did that by...

391
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:20,734
Riley, where is he?

392
00:24:22,216 --> 00:24:24,676
I don't know where he's been
but I know where he is now.

393
00:24:25,113 --> 00:24:26,779
Just landed
on the 46th floor.

394
00:24:27,052 --> 00:24:28,052
Thank you.

395
00:25:09,678 --> 00:25:10,554
Steve!!!!

396
00:25:10,555 --> 00:25:11,721
What are you doing?!!

397
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:26,990
It's me, Jane!!!!

398
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:27,414
Knew she wouldn't make it.

399
00:27:11,532 --> 00:27:12,532
Stop crying.

400
00:27:17,657 --> 00:27:18,657
Mom's dead.

401
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,596
There's nothing you
can do about it.

402
00:27:22,534 --> 00:27:24,311
When they put her
in the ground,

403
00:27:25,346 --> 00:27:26,846
say goodbye
and let her go.

404
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:34,581
Don't ever let them
see you cry again.

405
00:27:39,345 --> 00:27:41,567
Don't ever let them
see you cry again...

406
00:27:48,518 --> 00:27:49,518
He'll kill you.

407
00:27:49,641 --> 00:27:50,767
We all have our problems.

408
00:27:50,768 --> 00:27:52,142
The neuros tagged
and bagged, boss.

409
00:27:52,143 --> 00:27:55,014
This work is like any other work
you've done before.

410
00:27:55,015 --> 00:27:56,892
I call the shots in my life,
agent Mcbride.

411
00:27:56,893 --> 00:27:58,765
Your entire service record
has been red-flagged...

412
00:27:58,766 --> 00:28:00,210
What the hell
is going on?

413
00:28:00,691 --> 00:28:01,564
We hunt neuros...

414
00:28:01,565 --> 00:28:03,120
Dozen deaths, directly to...

415
00:28:04,501 --> 00:28:06,112
He's on the express elevator.

416
00:28:29,315 --> 00:28:30,315
No freakin' way!

417
00:28:32,501 --> 00:28:34,556
Boss, you better
take a look at this.

418
00:29:36,556 --> 00:29:37,556
Why am I not dead?

419
00:29:42,922 --> 00:29:44,310
Another "you don't know"?

420
00:29:48,548 --> 00:29:49,548
You're alive.

421
00:29:49,798 --> 00:29:52,520
That's the only thing
that's important right now.

422
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:00,548
Easy, easy, easy..

423
00:30:07,024 --> 00:30:08,801
Listen, I want you
to stay here,

424
00:30:09,837 --> 00:30:10,899
we'll monitor your vitals,

425
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,122
we'll do more testing.

426
00:30:35,464 --> 00:30:37,130
The neuro was
controlling him.

427
00:30:37,338 --> 00:30:38,393
Logical conclusion.

428
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:40,509
I'm more interested
in illogical ones.

429
00:30:40,648 --> 00:30:43,092
Agent Vasco survived
a forty-six story fall.

430
00:30:43,898 --> 00:30:46,209
There are freak accidents,
there are freak survivals.

431
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,648
Hundreds have
been documented.

432
00:30:47,649 --> 00:30:50,649
Plane crashes, suicide
attempts, construction workers.

433
00:30:50,712 --> 00:30:51,712
All lived.

434
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,622
Now what aren't
you telling me.

435
00:30:55,585 --> 00:30:56,210
Lacerations.

436
00:30:56,211 --> 00:30:56,961
Contusions.

437
00:30:56,962 --> 00:30:58,086
Internal organ damage.

438
00:30:58,087 --> 00:30:59,253
She doesn't have any.

439
00:31:01,213 --> 00:31:02,268
Not even a scratch.

440
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:03,961
But she...

441
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:06,710
No, nothing in her blood work,
tissue samples or brain scan

442
00:31:06,711 --> 00:31:09,655
indicate anything related
to what we're dealing with.

443
00:31:09,963 --> 00:31:11,518
So what is she
dealing with?

444
00:31:15,648 --> 00:31:17,425
Where do you think
you're going?

445
00:31:20,483 --> 00:31:22,483
I am so over this,
you have no idea.

446
00:31:24,671 --> 00:31:25,671
I am going home.

447
00:32:01,689 --> 00:32:02,689
You're...

448
00:32:02,814 --> 00:32:03,925
Supposed to be dead!

449
00:32:10,203 --> 00:32:11,203
That's okay.

450
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:15,653
The agency told me you fell
off a building.

451
00:32:16,453 --> 00:32:17,897
Drunks fall off buildings.

452
00:32:20,893 --> 00:32:21,893
I was pushed.

453
00:32:27,266 --> 00:32:28,266
I need a drink.

454
00:32:29,769 --> 00:32:32,157
Jane, you shouldn't have
left the hospital.

455
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:35,203
I didn't.

456
00:32:35,204 --> 00:32:36,204
I left the morgue.

457
00:32:36,577 --> 00:32:38,188
You know how I hate
the cold.

458
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,334
What the hell is going on?

459
00:32:41,768 --> 00:32:42,768
I don't know.

460
00:32:43,643 --> 00:32:45,031
I just fell forty stories

461
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:48,053
and now I'm looking
for a glass

462
00:32:48,828 --> 00:32:50,494
I should've washed
a week ago!

463
00:32:51,328 --> 00:32:52,328
Forty?

464
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:54,767
No, no, they said
it was four.

465
00:32:54,768 --> 00:32:55,768
Four is a...

466
00:32:55,828 --> 00:32:56,828
Possibility?

467
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:00,990
This is about neuros,
isn't it?

468
00:33:02,891 --> 00:33:04,779
Neuros, you just
stay out of this.

469
00:33:06,643 --> 00:33:08,389
I know you had
that dork from I.t.

470
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:11,501
Running checks on that guy
from the club, Andre Mcbride.

471
00:33:11,766 --> 00:33:14,202
I got onto his computer
and I ran a check on his check.

472
00:33:14,203 --> 00:33:15,536
Why did you do that for?

473
00:33:15,769 --> 00:33:17,824
Because covering
your ass is a habit.

474
00:33:20,078 --> 00:33:21,078
Are you okay?

475
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,242
You have no idea what
you just got yourself into,

476
00:33:29,768 --> 00:33:30,768
no idea.

477
00:33:31,766 --> 00:33:34,488
Mcbride recruited Maureen
the same say he did me,

478
00:33:34,954 --> 00:33:38,065
I tried talking myself into
believing she had it coming.

479
00:33:38,203 --> 00:33:39,980
And it involved caring
too much.

480
00:33:40,552 --> 00:33:41,552
Covering my ass.

481
00:33:42,242 --> 00:33:44,964
The truth is, I would have
done the same for her,

482
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:48,488
only I wouldn't have been
so damned dramatic about it.

483
00:33:48,489 --> 00:33:50,044
Keep your distance,
Maureen.

484
00:33:50,489 --> 00:33:51,655
You said these neuros

485
00:33:51,991 --> 00:33:54,366
need to be in close
proximity to the subject

486
00:33:54,367 --> 00:33:55,811
in order to exert control,

487
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:59,301
is there anyway to find out who
would have been close enough

488
00:33:59,302 --> 00:34:00,746
to both shannon and Steve?

489
00:34:01,551 --> 00:34:02,773
Been there, done that.

490
00:34:02,987 --> 00:34:05,119
No one who was within range
of shannon when she died

491
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,702
was above the tenth
floor of the building

492
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:08,432
when Steve went through
the window.

493
00:34:09,364 --> 00:34:11,427
Then how the hell does
a neuro influence people

494
00:34:11,428 --> 00:34:13,051
when they're
not within range?

495
00:34:13,052 --> 00:34:14,052
Remote control?

496
00:34:25,071 --> 00:34:26,071
The comm-sets!!

497
00:34:30,007 --> 00:34:31,007
Riley?

498
00:34:31,629 --> 00:34:35,129
I suppose transmission
through the airwave counts as proximity.

499
00:34:36,757 --> 00:34:37,878
It'd be a first, though.

500
00:34:37,879 --> 00:34:39,692
Everyone uses
that communication system.

501
00:34:39,693 --> 00:34:40,566
It could be anybody.

502
00:34:40,567 --> 00:34:42,629
But not everyone is
cleared to talk directly

503
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,741
to another employee.

504
00:34:44,069 --> 00:34:47,180
Who would have clear and open
access to the comm system?

505
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,117
It's got to be
Hyde's assistant!

506
00:34:56,711 --> 00:34:58,544
She runs the central
switchboard.

507
00:35:12,462 --> 00:35:13,149
Crap!

508
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:13,773
What?

509
00:35:13,774 --> 00:35:14,899
She just comm'd Maureen.

510
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,461
How could she
make it so quick?

511
00:35:16,462 --> 00:35:19,295
She can monitor the entire
operation from her desk.

512
00:35:27,567 --> 00:35:30,227
- Can you intercept the transmission?
- I'm trying to get in now!

513
00:35:34,213 --> 00:35:35,898
I can't intercept
but I can get in.

514
00:35:35,899 --> 00:35:37,276
Only it won't be
a secure connection.

515
00:35:37,277 --> 00:35:38,277
Do it.

516
00:35:38,776 --> 00:35:39,776
Do it.

517
00:35:43,775 --> 00:35:44,775
We're in.

518
00:35:46,087 --> 00:35:47,642
Your name is
Maureen bowers.

519
00:35:48,589 --> 00:35:50,337
You were recruited
by a government agency

520
00:35:50,338 --> 00:35:52,060
to hunt neurological
aberrants.

521
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:53,899
The thoughts
you're having...

522
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,066
They're not your own.

523
00:35:55,588 --> 00:35:58,088
Someone's trying to get
you to kill yourself!

524
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,455
Your name is
Maureen bowers.

525
00:36:06,962 --> 00:36:08,406
You were a d.e.a. Agent...

526
00:36:11,714 --> 00:36:12,714
Mo, it's me.

527
00:36:15,711 --> 00:36:17,044
You're being controlled!

528
00:36:20,777 --> 00:36:21,777
Dammit, mo!

529
00:36:22,463 --> 00:36:24,407
For once in your
life listen to me!

530
00:36:28,213 --> 00:36:30,213
If you don't stop
this second, mo...

531
00:36:32,839 --> 00:36:35,339
...who is going to be there
to watch my back?

532
00:37:25,399 --> 00:37:26,399
She's alive.

533
00:37:29,935 --> 00:37:32,295
Boss, Hyde's assistant is
leaving the building.

534
00:37:32,402 --> 00:37:33,519
Riley, stay on her.

535
00:37:33,712 --> 00:37:34,712
Let's move.

536
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:49,899
Approaching her...

537
00:37:51,961 --> 00:37:52,961
Now.

538
00:38:12,711 --> 00:38:14,523
She didn't go there
to turn herself in.

539
00:38:14,524 --> 00:38:15,746
Neuros control people.

540
00:38:16,319 --> 00:38:19,023
When you're being followed, who better
to control than people with guns.

541
00:38:19,024 --> 00:38:20,020
I say we go in anyway.

542
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:22,022
We badge the badges,
when the cop pulls his piece,

543
00:38:22,036 --> 00:38:23,586
we blow him away,
chip the bitch,

544
00:38:23,587 --> 00:38:25,273
let the feds straighten
it out later.

545
00:38:25,274 --> 00:38:27,648
Sounds like something you came
up with in prison, Connor.

546
00:38:27,649 --> 00:38:28,704
Did you say prison?

547
00:38:29,713 --> 00:38:31,459
There were extenuating
circumstances.

548
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,460
There always are.

549
00:38:36,646 --> 00:38:38,368
Ma'am,
you can't be back here!!

550
00:38:39,456 --> 00:38:40,622
They'll be here soon.

551
00:38:45,893 --> 00:38:46,893
Get down!!!

552
00:38:51,581 --> 00:38:53,858
There are all kinds
of decisions in life.

553
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:55,983
Some more difficult
than others.

554
00:38:56,456 --> 00:38:57,705
For the sake of the team,

555
00:38:57,706 --> 00:38:59,594
I knew the one
I was about to make

556
00:38:59,707 --> 00:39:01,095
was one I couldn't avoid.

557
00:39:01,395 --> 00:39:03,506
For the record,
I knew something else,

558
00:39:04,643 --> 00:39:06,365
it was going
to hurt like hell.

559
00:40:46,395 --> 00:40:48,672
Connor, get back
through the water here!!

560
00:40:53,331 --> 00:40:54,497
Hurry it up, Connor!!

561
00:40:58,207 --> 00:40:59,207
Let's go!!!!

562
00:41:04,667 --> 00:41:07,042
What the hell did you
think you were doing?

563
00:41:07,043 --> 00:41:08,431
Thinking outside
the box?

564
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:11,055
For future reference,
agent Vasco,

565
00:41:11,605 --> 00:41:13,271
I give the orders
around here.

566
00:41:14,042 --> 00:41:15,597
We're both alive,
aren't we?

567
00:41:15,916 --> 00:41:16,916
You shouldn't be!

568
00:41:19,605 --> 00:41:20,605
Listen to me,

569
00:41:21,982 --> 00:41:24,093
whatever the hell
is going on with me,

570
00:41:24,418 --> 00:41:26,584
I really need to know
what it is, okay?

571
00:41:28,044 --> 00:41:29,377
I'll find answers, Jane.

572
00:41:29,543 --> 00:41:30,543
You have my word.

573
00:41:39,668 --> 00:41:41,279
When my mother died,
it hurt.

574
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:42,666
It hurt a lot.

575
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,944
And something in me
had changed.

576
00:41:45,292 --> 00:41:47,903
I realized that pain was
going to be my friend.

577
00:41:48,168 --> 00:41:49,228
That it would sustain me.

578
00:41:49,229 --> 00:41:50,395
And make me stronger.

579
00:41:51,167 --> 00:41:53,333
I just never realized
how much stronger

580
00:41:53,666 --> 00:41:54,777
"stronger" would be.

581
00:41:55,231 --> 00:41:57,453
And how changed I would
actually become.

582
00:41:59,229 --> 00:42:00,605
I don't know
what happened to me.

583
00:42:00,606 --> 00:42:01,416
Or what it means.

584
00:42:01,417 --> 00:42:02,417
No one does yet.

585
00:42:03,042 --> 00:42:03,666
For right now,

586
00:42:03,667 --> 00:42:05,981
I'm just trying
to stay focused on the job

587
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:07,370
taking one day at a time,

588
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:11,457
putting one foot on the other.

589
00:42:21,042 --> 00:42:23,930
Boss, I know where Hyde went
on the express elevator

590
00:42:25,855 --> 00:42:26,855
floor 1-13

591
00:42:27,355 --> 00:42:28,910
only there is
no floor 1-13.

592
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,535
How he accessed
it? No idea.

593
00:42:31,042 --> 00:42:32,597
For what reason,
don't know.

594
00:42:32,982 --> 00:42:33,791
But I will.

595
00:42:33,792 --> 00:42:34,792
No, you won't.

596
00:42:35,792 --> 00:42:38,730
The mandate is to identify and
contain neurological aberrants,

597
00:42:38,731 --> 00:42:41,508
whatever happens after that,
it's not our problem.
