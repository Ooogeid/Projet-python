1
00:00:00,643 --> 00:00:02,093
My name is Jane Vasco.

2
00:00:02,146 --> 00:00:03,446
I could use you on my team.

3
00:00:03,559 --> 00:00:07,093
I work for a secret government
agency that hunts Neuros.

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,467
People who can do dangerous
things with their minds.

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,702
On my first assignment...

6
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,808
something a little weird happened,

7
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:17,829
okay, something really weird.

8
00:00:18,423 --> 00:00:21,323
Until I get some answers
I'm getting on with my life,

9
00:00:21,677 --> 00:00:23,047
doing my job...

10
00:00:23,152 --> 00:00:25,022
stocking up on aspirin...

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,731
because I gotta tell ya,

12
00:00:28,477 --> 00:00:30,337
pain's a bitch!

13
00:00:40,482 --> 00:00:42,288
Andre?

14
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:48,075
Sarah.

15
00:00:52,921 --> 00:00:54,968
I'll catch up to
you at the meeting.

16
00:00:55,103 --> 00:00:57,258
Sure, I'll see you there.

17
00:00:59,766 --> 00:01:02,190
How are you? You look well.

18
00:01:02,477 --> 00:01:04,555
I feel fine.

19
00:01:05,593 --> 00:01:07,316
And don't worry,

20
00:01:07,386 --> 00:01:10,381
I haven't walked through any
walls for a long time.

21
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,459
You look older.

22
00:01:15,594 --> 00:01:18,037
Still handsome, but older.

23
00:01:18,334 --> 00:01:20,045
Not wiser?

24
00:01:20,275 --> 00:01:22,188
You were wise when I met you.

25
00:01:22,223 --> 00:01:24,590
You always wear that well.

26
00:01:25,411 --> 00:01:29,500
If you're wondering,
I don't blame you for any of this.

27
00:01:29,626 --> 00:01:31,910
They've taken good care of me here.

28
00:01:31,985 --> 00:01:34,467
Good, I'm glad.

29
00:01:38,975 --> 00:01:41,051
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:41,169 --> 00:01:43,862
- I'm keeping you from your meeting.
- I do have to go.

31
00:01:43,931 --> 00:01:46,567
- Maybe we can talk some other time.
- Yes.

32
00:01:47,917 --> 00:01:49,936
It's good seeing you.

33
00:02:04,634 --> 00:02:06,916
Where's the boss?
I thought he was with you.

34
00:02:06,974 --> 00:02:09,261
He was. He's on his way.

35
00:02:09,923 --> 00:02:12,730
That'd give me a few minutes
to finish these protocols.

36
00:02:12,903 --> 00:02:16,125
I was out sampling the local
pub scene last night.

37
00:02:16,608 --> 00:02:18,253
I'll be right back.

38
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:21,917
What do you know about
a patient here...

39
00:02:21,952 --> 00:02:24,996
- Whackjob... Freak of nature...
- Name's Sarah.

40
00:02:31,835 --> 00:02:33,644
Why are you asking?

41
00:02:33,928 --> 00:02:35,844
Andre seemed to know her.

42
00:02:37,029 --> 00:02:39,924
- More than know her.
- Right, people, we've got work to do.

43
00:02:40,044 --> 00:02:42,816
Let's get cracking.
Where's Riley?

44
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:45,693
Let it go.

45
00:02:45,711 --> 00:02:48,443
You have those new patient
protocols from Dr. Newman yet?

46
00:02:48,839 --> 00:02:51,217
Just waiting for you, boss.

47
00:02:56,063 --> 00:02:57,842
Looks like a false alarm, sir.

48
00:02:57,861 --> 00:03:00,964
We're finishing our sweep and should've
an all-clear in the next five minutes.

49
00:03:01,022 --> 00:03:04,055
We'll need your approval
for the all clear. Please.

50
00:03:43,633 --> 00:03:45,483
Security!

51
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:48,457
How did you...

52
00:03:49,976 --> 00:03:52,051
What do you want?

53
00:03:52,945 --> 00:03:54,984
What do you...!

54
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:01,515
The answers to so many questions.

55
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:21,124
PAINKILLER JANE 1x21 "REFLECTIONS"
Subtitles subXpacio and TusSeries
Corrected by IceFre@k

56
00:04:23,683 --> 00:04:28,349
They say that when you look into a
mirror you see what you want to see.

57
00:04:28,881 --> 00:04:32,861
While the image is a literal reflection
of whatever's in front of it,

58
00:04:32,896 --> 00:04:36,040
what we see is clouded
by our perception.

59
00:04:36,363 --> 00:04:39,391
Whether it be of beauty, imperfection,

60
00:04:39,426 --> 00:04:42,117
triumph or failure.

61
00:04:42,446 --> 00:04:44,443
Our take on what surrounds us...

62
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,475
is only as real as our
take on what is inside us.

63
00:04:48,812 --> 00:04:53,164
It sheds a whole new light on the
phrase, "seeing is believing.”

64
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:12,111
Sarah?

65
00:05:12,885 --> 00:05:14,582
Am I interrupting?

66
00:05:16,223 --> 00:05:18,543
I'm sorry about running off
when we met yesterday.

67
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:21,008
I understand, you're working here.

68
00:05:21,423 --> 00:05:22,811
You knew I was here?

69
00:05:22,881 --> 00:05:25,072
Everyone knows you're here, Andre.

70
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,380
Things are a lot better...

71
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:31,753
because of the changes
you and your people have made.

72
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:34,337
But that's no surprise.

73
00:05:34,355 --> 00:05:37,156
I can't claim that
I offered you a better life.

74
00:05:37,662 --> 00:05:39,957
But you did, Andre...

75
00:05:40,355 --> 00:05:43,151
I was doing things
I shouldn't have been doing.

76
00:05:43,714 --> 00:05:45,552
You were doing your job.

77
00:05:46,193 --> 00:05:50,199
I always knew something was wrong
with me, but I was willing to use it.

78
00:05:50,664 --> 00:05:52,247
Ever since you...

79
00:05:53,298 --> 00:05:55,996
Ever since you chipped me
and sent me here...

80
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:00,183
Believe it or not, life is a lot
more normal than it had been.

81
00:06:00,501 --> 00:06:01,952
You don't miss your freedom?

82
00:06:02,008 --> 00:06:04,239
But I don't miss
the life I was living,

83
00:06:04,327 --> 00:06:06,384
the things I was doing.

84
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:09,565
Freedom means different
things to different people.

85
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,117
...and bizarre murder has taken place at
offices at the national security agency.

86
00:06:14,352 --> 00:06:18,355
Boris Czmerick, a senior officer
for the agency was found dead...

87
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:19,680
Oh, dear god.

88
00:06:19,715 --> 00:06:21,854
...his heart removed from his body.

89
00:06:22,763 --> 00:06:24,515
I've seen that man in a dream.

90
00:06:24,531 --> 00:06:27,975
...no suspect or motive
for this brutal crime.

91
00:06:29,446 --> 00:06:32,985
But it was only a dream.
A horrible nightmare.

92
00:06:34,164 --> 00:06:35,762
It's all right.

93
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:39,129
Andre, I have been in that room,
I have seen that man!

94
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:41,365
That's impossible.
You just said it was a nightmare.

95
00:06:41,421 --> 00:06:44,256
You probably just saw him on TV
before or read about it in the papers.

96
00:06:44,349 --> 00:06:48,306
No, something happened in
that room! Something awful!

97
00:06:48,362 --> 00:06:51,794
You have to make it stop, Andre!
Please, make it stop!

98
00:06:53,573 --> 00:06:55,984
You have to tell someone, please!

99
00:06:56,654 --> 00:06:59,216
Oh, god, someone help me!

100
00:07:02,953 --> 00:07:06,160
I'll need a full scan, MRI,
cross-sections, CTI, everything.

101
00:07:06,236 --> 00:07:08,652
- Laterals?
- Might as well. Keep her well-sedated.

102
00:07:08,817 --> 00:07:11,203
I want the results as
soon as you have them.

103
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:13,236
What have you got?

104
00:07:13,592 --> 00:07:15,659
Not much more than you know, boss.

105
00:07:16,322 --> 00:07:18,415
The guy was high up
the food chain at ENSA.

106
00:07:18,503 --> 00:07:21,256
No sign of forced entry, and even
though an alarm was triggered...

107
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,250
no one saw a thing,
not even the cameras.

108
00:07:23,369 --> 00:07:26,672
Whoever got to him didn't use
the front door, that's for sure.

109
00:07:26,732 --> 00:07:30,010
Just keep digging, Riley. I'm sure
somewhere, someone found something.

110
00:07:30,304 --> 00:07:32,436
- Okay, boss, I'll do my best.
- Thank you.

111
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:36,596
- Talk to me.
- She's stabilized.

112
00:07:36,615 --> 00:07:38,652
We're running a full battery of tests.

113
00:07:38,673 --> 00:07:39,758
And the chip?

114
00:07:39,781 --> 00:07:42,868
It's in place and appears
to be functioning normally.

115
00:07:43,401 --> 00:07:46,090
Well, then it's impossible
that she did what she said she did.

116
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:49,181
I've worked here long enough to
never say "never," agent McBride.

117
00:07:49,275 --> 00:07:50,937
I'll keep you posted.

118
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,255
We've got another
problem at customs.

119
00:08:12,441 --> 00:08:14,852
The last shipment of medication
wasn't properly labeled.

120
00:08:15,045 --> 00:08:18,167
They say you have to go down and sign
for it or they won't release it.

121
00:08:18,222 --> 00:08:20,072
Is there anything else
anybody needs me to do?

122
00:08:20,172 --> 00:08:23,255
- No, doctor. I was just told to...
- Thanks, I've got it.

123
00:08:30,932 --> 00:08:32,270
Wanna talk about it?

124
00:08:32,405 --> 00:08:33,592
There's nothing to talk about.

125
00:08:33,654 --> 00:08:36,057
Please, you can pull that B.S.
on Vasco, but not me.

126
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,307
You have something to say to
me, agent King, spit it out.

127
00:08:40,371 --> 00:08:44,374
She's a woman. Chip or no chip, twisted
DNA or not, they're all a little freaky.

128
00:08:44,467 --> 00:08:46,909
But most of all, they have a
way of making us freaky.

129
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:49,752
Are you suggesting that I'm letting
my personal feelings get involved?

130
00:08:49,788 --> 00:08:52,456
I'm just sayin', be careful
and stay on your game.

131
00:08:52,606 --> 00:08:55,174
We got a corpse in town,
no idea how the perp got in.

132
00:08:55,232 --> 00:08:56,832
She's saying, "I did it, I did it!"

133
00:08:56,923 --> 00:08:59,002
And we both know she has
the talent to have done it.

134
00:08:59,042 --> 00:09:02,886
Is there indication that she or anyone
else left the perimeter last night?

135
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,505
No, what the lady's capable of...

136
00:09:05,597 --> 00:09:07,639
This is not a guessing game, agent King!

137
00:09:07,692 --> 00:09:10,628
At present, there's no reason to suspect
that Sarah Rogers had either...

138
00:09:10,663 --> 00:09:13,596
the capability, or the opportunity
to commit that crime.

139
00:09:13,656 --> 00:09:15,682
Have I made myself clear!

140
00:09:16,903 --> 00:09:18,570
Crystal.

141
00:09:44,552 --> 00:09:46,534
Hey, doc, how are ya'?
I'm sorry about this.

142
00:09:46,569 --> 00:09:49,730
- I just need to sign it and get back.
- Here ya go. Great.

143
00:09:49,853 --> 00:09:52,347
- I'll bring the pallet from the back.
- Thanks.

144
00:09:58,133 --> 00:10:01,294
This is Dr. Thomas. Could you put me
through to radiology, please?

145
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,188
Hello, doctor.

146
00:10:06,317 --> 00:10:08,533
How the hell did you...?

147
00:10:18,582 --> 00:10:19,848
What've we got?

148
00:10:19,967 --> 00:10:24,305
One of our doctors, Dr. Thomas,
went missing a couple hours ago.

149
00:10:24,435 --> 00:10:26,982
He was last scene at customs,
picking up medical supplies.

150
00:10:27,006 --> 00:10:28,942
- Did you do a head count?
- First thing we did.

151
00:10:28,988 --> 00:10:30,454
And all patients are accounted for.

152
00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:32,938
All right, hold on.

153
00:10:34,037 --> 00:10:35,919
I think I might have something.

154
00:10:36,007 --> 00:10:38,781
Just pulled this off the security
cameras at the customs office.

155
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,511
It's a little bit grainy, but...

156
00:10:43,498 --> 00:10:45,222
What are we looking at?

157
00:10:54,772 --> 00:10:56,767
You've reviewed all the footage?

158
00:10:57,274 --> 00:10:59,427
She was taken
to recovery after her tests.

159
00:10:59,715 --> 00:11:02,481
There is no camera in that room
but, like the last time, there is...

160
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:06,968
no images or records of anyone leaving
the premises besides Dr. Thomas.

161
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,910
Even if she did walk through the wall,
she couldn't be in two places at once.

162
00:11:10,953 --> 00:11:14,035
I understand, sir. I'm just
telling you what we know.

163
00:11:18,292 --> 00:11:20,443
What about blind spots in the system?

164
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,446
Like I said, not every room
is covered...

165
00:11:22,501 --> 00:11:25,334
but there are no blind spots
along any part of the perimeter.

166
00:11:26,067 --> 00:11:28,875
- Did she say anything?
- She's pretty shaken.

167
00:11:28,942 --> 00:11:31,689
Keeps talking about doing
these things in her dreams.

168
00:11:31,996 --> 00:11:35,533
- And what do you think?
- Right now? I don't.

169
00:11:47,394 --> 00:11:48,738
Can I talk to her?

170
00:11:48,795 --> 00:11:50,873
She's groggy from the medication.

171
00:11:50,928 --> 00:11:53,280
I'm not sure what
you'll get from her.

172
00:12:16,586 --> 00:12:18,423
Sarah.

173
00:12:20,864 --> 00:12:22,684
Go away, please.

174
00:12:23,132 --> 00:12:25,045
Tell me about your dreams.

175
00:12:25,096 --> 00:12:27,635
- I don't want to talk about them.
- You have to.

176
00:12:28,538 --> 00:12:30,815
We need to understand
what's going on.

177
00:12:34,845 --> 00:12:36,999
I've had them for years.

178
00:12:37,179 --> 00:12:39,341
Ever since I was a child.

179
00:12:40,253 --> 00:12:42,670
You saw yourself hurting people?

180
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,033
Not always.

181
00:12:47,292 --> 00:12:49,070
Sometimes.

182
00:12:50,344 --> 00:12:52,401
It's hard to explain.

183
00:12:54,346 --> 00:12:58,430
It's as if I could see myself
from the outside...

184
00:12:58,687 --> 00:13:01,620
and watch what I was doing.

185
00:13:03,624 --> 00:13:07,323
But the feeling was
always the same.

186
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,604
As if I were searching for something.

187
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,734
Searching for what?

188
00:13:14,776 --> 00:13:16,620
I don't know.

189
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:22,092
As if part of me was missing.

190
00:13:23,895 --> 00:13:27,627
- I told you it was hard to explain.
- That's all right, go on.

191
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:33,464
The dreams stopped for
a while after you sent here.

192
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,258
Though they never really
frightened me,

193
00:13:39,732 --> 00:13:42,092
I felt relieved that they were gone.

194
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,009
When did they start again?

195
00:13:45,066 --> 00:13:48,144
I don't know.
A few months ago.

196
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,803
And then the other night when
I murdered that man...

197
00:13:51,861 --> 00:13:53,710
When you dreamt that
you murdered that man...

198
00:13:53,765 --> 00:13:55,534
And last night again,

199
00:13:55,638 --> 00:13:57,442
I tortured someone.

200
00:13:57,523 --> 00:13:58,945
A man.

201
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:04,006
He begged me to stop. And I wanted
to make it stop but I couldn't.

202
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:05,890
Did you recognize the man?

203
00:14:07,572 --> 00:14:10,332
No, he was so far away.

204
00:14:14,681 --> 00:14:17,873
I could tell he was dressed in white.

205
00:14:19,057 --> 00:14:21,769
I think he might have been a...
I don't know.

206
00:14:21,858 --> 00:14:24,071
- Like a doctor?
- Yes.

207
00:14:24,183 --> 00:14:27,259
Did something happen?
Was someone else hurt?

208
00:14:27,306 --> 00:14:29,429
That's what we're
trying to find out.

209
00:14:29,464 --> 00:14:31,207
Now, listen to me...

210
00:14:31,407 --> 00:14:33,823
I need you to tell me everything
you can about that dream.

211
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:36,441
Faces, places, anything
you can remember.

212
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,678
It's all so vague.

213
00:14:39,804 --> 00:14:43,585
I saw him...
His white coat, anyway.

214
00:14:46,817 --> 00:14:50,491
And trees. Lots of trees.

215
00:14:52,968 --> 00:14:55,786
And a fountain, maybe...

216
00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:57,930
Somewhere,

217
00:14:58,742 --> 00:15:01,653
I heard the sound of running water.

218
00:15:07,858 --> 00:15:10,295
I can't remember any more.

219
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,563
That's all right.

220
00:15:12,976 --> 00:15:14,788
Tell me what happened.

221
00:15:21,162 --> 00:15:23,654
You get some rest, okay?

222
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:30,194
I'll try and visit you
as soon as I can, okay?

223
00:15:38,484 --> 00:15:40,493
Andre?

224
00:15:45,426 --> 00:15:49,269
Maybe it would have been better if
you'd killed me when you had the chance.

225
00:16:07,252 --> 00:16:09,271
What do you think?

226
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:13,187
You get any of the test results?

227
00:16:13,341 --> 00:16:15,983
They all came back
negative or inconclusive.

228
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:20,178
There's still nothing to indicate
that the chip is malfunctioning.

229
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:30,405
I want her isolated.

230
00:16:30,462 --> 00:16:33,120
I want her sedated,
and I mean paralyzed.

231
00:16:33,155 --> 00:16:36,195
I want her physiological and mental
activity monitored twenty-four-seven.

232
00:16:36,248 --> 00:16:38,678
Post guards. No one goes in or
out without my authorization.

233
00:16:38,712 --> 00:16:40,354
Already in place.

234
00:16:44,016 --> 00:16:47,030
The location she
mentioned. Trees maybe...

235
00:16:47,365 --> 00:16:49,298
a fountain. Are there any...

236
00:16:49,358 --> 00:16:53,498
In this part of the world,
a few dozen, maybe.

237
00:16:56,251 --> 00:16:58,989
Riley's going to need
a starting point.

238
00:17:00,014 --> 00:17:03,314
If she's right, maybe we
could find this Dr. Thomas.

239
00:17:11,106 --> 00:17:13,508
This is the last location
I picked up from the cell phone.

240
00:17:13,543 --> 00:17:15,371
Signal went dead after that.

241
00:17:31,247 --> 00:17:32,675
Clear.

242
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,656
You hear that?

243
00:17:37,032 --> 00:17:40,273
Sound of running water.
We're close.

244
00:17:40,308 --> 00:17:43,263
- All right, let's go.
- Let's roll people.

245
00:17:43,298 --> 00:17:46,324
Stay by the car!

246
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:50,158
I'll stay by the car.

247
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:30,442
Over here!

248
00:18:53,163 --> 00:18:55,079
I've got a "last dialed,"

249
00:18:55,214 --> 00:18:57,076
don't know what it means.

250
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,260
You can run it when we get back.

251
00:19:01,797 --> 00:19:03,612
Get him out of here.

252
00:19:25,409 --> 00:19:29,255
Look, you told me to back off on
Andre's history with Sarah and I did.

253
00:19:29,618 --> 00:19:32,003
But given the current
circumstances that information...

254
00:19:32,106 --> 00:19:34,592
has now fallen into the
need-to-know category,

255
00:19:34,911 --> 00:19:36,682
I need to know.

256
00:19:37,819 --> 00:19:39,860
Let's walk.

257
00:19:50,639 --> 00:19:54,632
Three years ago we were on the trail
of a chip-job that had been stealing...

258
00:19:54,667 --> 00:19:58,198
drugs and pricey medical
gear from a major hospital.

259
00:19:58,378 --> 00:20:01,390
We assumed the drugs were being
stolen and sold on the street.

260
00:20:01,419 --> 00:20:05,850
But we had no idea how they were
getting in or out of secured areas.

261
00:20:07,463 --> 00:20:10,966
We figured it was an inside job
so we started interviewing people.

262
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,090
Sarah happened
to be one of the first.

263
00:20:14,787 --> 00:20:17,351
She worked in the laundry room
in the hospital.

264
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:20,437
Seemed like a good kid,
honest, hard-working.

265
00:20:22,189 --> 00:20:26,317
Time went on, we thought we had
our Neuro pinned as an orderly.

266
00:20:26,535 --> 00:20:28,481
Real bad guy.

267
00:20:28,785 --> 00:20:30,941
Criminal record longer than mine.

268
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,900
Usual procedure.

269
00:20:35,081 --> 00:20:37,254
I caught up with him after
one night of drinking.

270
00:20:37,289 --> 00:20:41,150
Swiped a bit of DNA for the doc but
we figured the point was moot.

271
00:20:41,467 --> 00:20:44,316
I mean, all evidence
pointed towards this guy.

272
00:20:45,806 --> 00:20:49,092
Anyway by that time, Andre had
gotten pretty cozy with Sarah.

273
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:52,462
First time I'd ever seen that
happen, but why the hell not?

274
00:20:52,536 --> 00:20:56,899
She was bright, kind, innocent.
Everything we weren't used to.

275
00:20:56,929 --> 00:20:59,762
To the boss, probably felt
like a breath of fresh air.

276
00:21:01,116 --> 00:21:05,108
Things got ugly though, when our
prime suspect tested Neuro negative.

277
00:21:06,482 --> 00:21:10,327
Riley's busy running possibles
with his usual enthusiasm...

278
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,536
when he finds out that
Sarah's mother is sick,

279
00:21:15,386 --> 00:21:16,682
very sick.

280
00:21:16,748 --> 00:21:19,408
Whatever she had, she probably
wasn't going to pull through.

281
00:21:19,431 --> 00:21:21,302
There were treatments...

282
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:26,047
but they cost a lot of coin
which Sarah didn't have.

283
00:21:27,594 --> 00:21:30,814
It wasn't easy for the boy wonder
to tell the boss what he'd found.

284
00:21:31,049 --> 00:21:34,538
None the less, I thought we'd run
straight away on it. We didn't.

285
00:21:34,951 --> 00:21:36,898
He put a nix on it.

286
00:21:38,828 --> 00:21:42,073
Said it was something
that could wait.

287
00:21:47,142 --> 00:21:49,819
Guess it was something he
wanted to take care of himself.

288
00:21:49,871 --> 00:21:51,443
Andre?

289
00:22:04,806 --> 00:22:08,127
The kid was just trying to lift
enough medicine to help her mother.

290
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,539
After they shipped Sarah off,

291
00:22:11,557 --> 00:22:14,915
Andre made arrangements for
her mother to receive treatment.

292
00:22:15,609 --> 00:22:19,373
Why not? She deserved it as
much as people with money.

293
00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:23,554
But eventually she fell through
the cracks, got lost in the system.

294
00:22:25,336 --> 00:22:27,667
First time I ever saw the boss
doubt what we were doing.

295
00:22:27,712 --> 00:22:30,053
He came this close to walking.

296
00:22:31,406 --> 00:22:33,457
I don't know what to say.

297
00:22:34,107 --> 00:22:35,912
You aren't going to say anything.

298
00:22:35,982 --> 00:22:39,126
I told you this because I don't know if
I could trust his judgment right now...

299
00:22:39,172 --> 00:22:40,853
and I need you to back me up.

300
00:22:41,205 --> 00:22:44,759
Other than that, darlin', this
conversation never happened.

301
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:19,341
Oh, my god! What have they done to you?

302
00:24:25,143 --> 00:24:28,818
It's taken me so long,
but after all these years...

303
00:24:28,953 --> 00:24:31,454
I've finally found you,

304
00:24:31,635 --> 00:24:34,255
my beautiful sister.

305
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:37,709
We've looked at this in every
possible way,

306
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,801
Sarah was under complete
lockdown and monitored...

307
00:24:39,859 --> 00:24:41,497
at the very time of Dr. Thomas' murder.

308
00:24:41,542 --> 00:24:42,706
Yes.

309
00:24:42,905 --> 00:24:46,015
There were no marked
changes in her physiology.

310
00:24:46,089 --> 00:24:49,053
EEG, GSR, heart rate, respiration,

311
00:24:49,151 --> 00:24:50,899
are all within the norms.

312
00:24:50,927 --> 00:24:52,504
The data doesn't lie, doctor.

313
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,017
And the video that
Riley obtained...

314
00:24:55,099 --> 00:24:58,564
the images from the customs
office, are they lying?

315
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,845
- That was Sarah.
- Or someone who looked like Sarah.

316
00:25:00,891 --> 00:25:03,480
Now, what about Baumgartner?
He could easily have taken her form.

317
00:25:03,515 --> 00:25:06,152
The facility is secure, Andre.
You've seen to that.

318
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:09,561
Baumgartner's a shape shifter
but he can't walk through walls.

319
00:25:09,628 --> 00:25:12,746
And Sarah can't be in two places
at once. I have made my decision.

320
00:25:12,797 --> 00:25:15,696
I want Sarah taken out of lockdown.
Discontinue the sedation.

321
00:25:15,721 --> 00:25:18,705
- Don't you think that you might be...?
- Might be in charge around here?

322
00:25:20,892 --> 00:25:24,015
Good.
I'm glad we understand one another.

323
00:25:25,705 --> 00:25:29,768
Just before my mother died,
she told me I was adopted.

324
00:25:29,922 --> 00:25:33,529
She told me about you,
my twin sister.

325
00:25:33,678 --> 00:25:37,079
How we were separated.
Why we were separated.

326
00:25:38,168 --> 00:25:41,994
And then all began to make sense.
The dreams...

327
00:25:43,072 --> 00:25:45,061
You've had them, too?

328
00:25:45,098 --> 00:25:47,045
As if you were looking for something?

329
00:25:47,071 --> 00:25:50,040
Not something, Sarah, someone.

330
00:25:50,294 --> 00:25:54,190
A part of me I always knew
was missing. But not anymore.

331
00:25:55,317 --> 00:25:59,784
We're special, in so many ways.

332
00:26:06,415 --> 00:26:10,087
But then those dreams...
That man...

333
00:26:11,958 --> 00:26:14,156
Abby, you killed that man!

334
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:16,219
And Dr. Thomas!

335
00:26:17,022 --> 00:26:20,891
He was the man in white, wasn't he?
You murdered them!

336
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:24,216
- No.
- I saw it! I thought I had done it.

337
00:26:24,321 --> 00:26:25,869
Sarah, 

338
00:26:25,916 --> 00:26:28,101
when my mother finally passed,


339
00:26:28,193 --> 00:26:29,881
I knew I had to find you.

340
00:26:29,948 --> 00:26:32,758
No matter how hard or
how long is gonna take.

341
00:26:33,012 --> 00:26:36,365
When I finally managed
to track you down...

342
00:26:36,864 --> 00:26:39,987
it was as if you'd vanished off
the face of the Earth.

343
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:43,368
I had come so close to
finding you and you were gone.

344
00:26:43,723 --> 00:26:47,872
It took me another four years to
find out that they'd sent you here.

345
00:26:48,211 --> 00:26:50,228
No one knows about this place.

346
00:26:51,037 --> 00:26:53,062
I know a great deal
about this place.

347
00:26:53,156 --> 00:26:56,918
I know what they did to you.
The man that did it to you.

348
00:26:56,973 --> 00:26:59,054
What they do here.

349
00:26:59,877 --> 00:27:02,717
You and I are different.

350
00:27:02,925 --> 00:27:05,959
We can go places and see
things others can't.

351
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:10,591
This is a bad place, Sarah.
I've come to take you home.

352
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,983
But Dr. Thomas...
He never hurt anyone.

353
00:27:15,044 --> 00:27:17,891
That's right.
Dr. Thomas was a good man.

354
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,717
The more I looked into this place,

355
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:22,917
the more I understood just
how vile and cruel it was.

356
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:25,351
A place where people like you,

357
00:27:25,525 --> 00:27:30,320
good people, are locked away because
they fear what they don't understand.

358
00:27:32,387 --> 00:27:35,093
Dr. Thomas knew that.
And there were others.

359
00:27:35,123 --> 00:27:39,095
I tried to meet with them.
They promised to help me get to you.

360
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:43,262
It wasn't me, Sarah.
Their people got to them first.

361
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,243
That man, McBride...

362
00:27:47,155 --> 00:27:50,791
Andre?
He wouldn't murder anyone.

363
00:27:50,846 --> 00:27:53,931
He would if it meant
keeping this place a secret,

364
00:27:54,143 --> 00:27:57,105
silencing the people
who'd want to expose it.

365
00:27:59,308 --> 00:28:03,218
The most important thing right
now is to get you out of here.

366
00:28:03,468 --> 00:28:06,504
Getting in, I'm afraid, is a
lot easier than getting out.

367
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:08,817
They watch us closely.

368
00:28:09,169 --> 00:28:13,597
That's why I need you to stay here in
case someone comes in and checks on you.

369
00:28:15,142 --> 00:28:17,982
I'll see if I can find a way out.

370
00:28:23,331 --> 00:28:25,399
Soon.

371
00:28:45,016 --> 00:28:47,085
Sarah...

372
00:28:49,874 --> 00:28:52,074
I need to talk to you.

373
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,726
I apologize for the way you've been
treated, but I had to be sure.

374
00:29:03,743 --> 00:29:05,863
And now you are?

375
00:29:05,966 --> 00:29:07,719
I know you.

376
00:29:07,852 --> 00:29:10,297
I know what you're capable of,
and what you're not.

377
00:29:11,075 --> 00:29:14,636
When I met you, despite your power, all
you wanted to do is help your mother.

378
00:29:14,751 --> 00:29:16,797
But that's why you put me here.

379
00:29:17,607 --> 00:29:20,306
- Yes, because of...
- What I am.

380
00:29:20,568 --> 00:29:22,628
What I can do.

381
00:29:23,879 --> 00:29:28,341
Sarah, until very recently, I had no
idea what was going on at this place.

382
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:31,135
- I'm trying to make it better.
- A better prison.

383
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:34,329
A better place to learn
about you and people like you.

384
00:29:35,213 --> 00:29:37,663
- We need to understand...
- What you fear.

385
00:29:38,992 --> 00:29:40,914
Maybe.

386
00:29:41,891 --> 00:29:44,081
But if it had been up to me...

387
00:29:44,439 --> 00:29:46,328
things might have turned
out differently.

388
00:29:47,346 --> 00:29:49,531
But it was up to you, Andre.

389
00:29:50,482 --> 00:29:52,815
We all have a choice.

390
00:29:54,203 --> 00:29:56,286
All right...

391
00:29:56,321 --> 00:29:59,558
You are not the first person to
suggest that all of this is all wrong.

392
00:30:00,096 --> 00:30:02,635
- Having a change of heart?
- No.

393
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:06,262
I don't see the world as black and
white, despite what you think.

394
00:30:06,345 --> 00:30:09,538
And I don't necessarily fear
what I don't understand.

395
00:30:10,374 --> 00:30:12,427
Not everyone here is like you.

396
00:30:12,507 --> 00:30:15,533
There are people that possess great
power and they use it for personal gain,

397
00:30:15,572 --> 00:30:17,458
at the expense of others.

398
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,929
But you just said,
I'm not like the others.

399
00:30:21,009 --> 00:30:21,781
Yes.

400
00:30:21,816 --> 00:30:25,990
And yet you used your power to
take away mine and lock me up here.

401
00:30:26,648 --> 00:30:29,023
Maybe the only people
that should be locked up here,

402
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:31,344
are people who misused their power.

403
00:30:32,177 --> 00:30:37,160
Maybe the wrong people are
behind these walls, agent McBride.

404
00:30:54,542 --> 00:30:58,965
The main exits are too well guarded. The
only way out is through the outer wall.

405
00:30:59,178 --> 00:31:02,829
The problem is they are too thick.
Too thick to go through alone.

406
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:08,141
But if we tried together,
combined, maybe we could...

407
00:31:08,197 --> 00:31:10,268
They took away my power, Abby.

408
00:31:10,349 --> 00:31:12,549
Even if we could do what you say...

409
00:31:12,636 --> 00:31:14,690
The chip can be removed.

410
00:31:14,738 --> 00:31:19,202
It's a simple electrical device, that
lodges itself in the cranial cortex.

411
00:31:19,237 --> 00:31:21,859
What goes in, can come out.

412
00:31:22,217 --> 00:31:23,925
Lean forward.

413
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,161
You know I would never hurt you.

414
00:31:45,252 --> 00:31:47,795
- I think we should talk about this.
- There's nothing to say.

415
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:49,712
Nothing, or too much?

416
00:31:50,019 --> 00:31:52,064
Don't you think I know how you feel?

417
00:31:52,131 --> 00:31:54,669
I not sure I care at this moment, Jane.

418
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,825
I've just looked in on Sarah.

419
00:31:56,848 --> 00:32:00,544
They've discontinued the sedation
and she'll be released shortly.

420
00:32:01,145 --> 00:32:03,117
- What are you talking about?
- Just what I said.

421
00:32:03,226 --> 00:32:07,042
As soon as the medication's sufficiently
worn off, she'll be released.

422
00:32:07,263 --> 00:32:08,690
When did you see her?

423
00:32:08,723 --> 00:32:10,946
I just left her a few minutes ago.

424
00:32:11,481 --> 00:32:13,179
So did I.

425
00:32:13,229 --> 00:32:15,965
This is McBride, security
breach, code red. Go!

426
00:32:15,989 --> 00:32:19,490
I want this place on
full lock-down! Now!

427
00:32:20,072 --> 00:32:23,325
Emergency lockdown
on all doors! Yes!

428
00:32:31,426 --> 00:32:33,515
Damn.

429
00:32:34,193 --> 00:32:37,452
This is McBride.
Detainee escape, Sarah Rogers.

430
00:32:37,514 --> 00:32:40,764
Possible breach of outer perimeter. I
want checkpoints set up on all roads out

431
00:32:40,921 --> 00:32:43,265
establish a search grid assuming
a ten minute head start,

432
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:45,934
monitor all choke points.

433
00:32:46,884 --> 00:32:49,291
Approach target
with extreme caution.

434
00:32:59,241 --> 00:33:01,100
We have to try this.

435
00:33:01,334 --> 00:33:03,417
Concentrate.

436
00:33:03,452 --> 00:33:05,402
Feel me.

437
00:33:11,411 --> 00:33:13,998
We have to do this together.

438
00:33:20,455 --> 00:33:23,133
Have you ever felt anything like it?

439
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,356
- Come on let's go!
- No!

440
00:33:37,491 --> 00:33:40,990
Boss I've got a hit. One of the trucks
from the motor-pool is on the move.

441
00:33:41,101 --> 00:33:43,188
Got a good solid signal
on the tracking device.

442
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:44,458
How do you want to play this?

443
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,891
Chipping her sure as hell
isn't going to do anything.

444
00:33:46,981 --> 00:33:49,896
Hey, I make that call.

445
00:33:49,931 --> 00:33:52,837
She's a Neuro boss, she's already
killed two people that we know of.

446
00:33:52,894 --> 00:33:55,397
- I make that call.
- There's no other alternative.

447
00:33:55,457 --> 00:33:57,482
Damn it, Connor, enough!

448
00:34:04,606 --> 00:34:06,436
You know what? He's right.

449
00:34:07,171 --> 00:34:09,652
We can't risk losing
any more lives.

450
00:34:10,488 --> 00:34:13,582
You've told me a hundred times
that we can't let personal feelings...

451
00:34:13,617 --> 00:34:15,683
interfere with the work.

452
00:34:15,912 --> 00:34:17,636
We have a job to do.

453
00:34:17,716 --> 00:34:21,149
This is delta-six-zero. I've got
a visual on the target vehicle.

454
00:34:21,167 --> 00:34:22,824
Going to make a stop.

455
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,018
Let's roll.

456
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:43,668
Keep out of sight.

457
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:50,068
Stay where you are!

458
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:53,060
I am authorized to shoot!
Stay where you are!

459
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:57,275
I don't want to shoot you!

460
00:35:13,927 --> 00:35:15,905
Come on, let's go!

461
00:35:23,006 --> 00:35:26,315
Signal's stationary. Should
be directly in front of you.

462
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:35,665
Still think we should chip her?

463
00:35:35,789 --> 00:35:38,066
Get to high ground,
she can't be far.

464
00:35:38,304 --> 00:35:41,471
And Connor, don't you dare
shoot without my order!

465
00:35:41,596 --> 00:35:43,219
Copy that.

466
00:35:44,657 --> 00:35:46,138
Go!

467
00:36:31,209 --> 00:36:33,187
I've got eyes on target.

468
00:36:33,406 --> 00:36:35,444
In the church, just
south of your position.

469
00:36:35,609 --> 00:36:37,580
Take the back and
flush her towards me.

470
00:36:37,638 --> 00:36:40,320
Maybe you should flush her toward
me. You've seen what she can do.

471
00:36:40,378 --> 00:36:43,205
How about I give the orders
around here, Vasco. Get moving!

472
00:36:55,769 --> 00:36:58,573
- We have to keep moving.
- No.

473
00:36:58,602 --> 00:37:00,037
Sarah, listen to me...

474
00:37:00,094 --> 00:37:02,451
You killed that man out there.
I saw you.

475
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:04,361
Just like you killed the others.

476
00:37:04,396 --> 00:37:07,806
Do you realize what
I went through to find you?

477
00:37:07,926 --> 00:37:09,571
We have a gift.

478
00:37:09,878 --> 00:37:12,268
Can't you imagine the possibilities?

479
00:37:12,303 --> 00:37:16,076
You saw the strength that we have,
we were meant to be together.

480
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:19,538
- You and I are the same.
- We are not the same.

481
00:37:19,912 --> 00:37:22,015
I am not going with you.

482
00:37:23,787 --> 00:37:25,138
Fine.

483
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,948
I'm in.

484
00:37:52,314 --> 00:37:54,169
No sign of her yet.

485
00:37:55,886 --> 00:37:57,815
I'm heading for higher ground.

486
00:37:58,713 --> 00:38:00,900
Copy that.
Connor keep your eyes open.

487
00:38:01,055 --> 00:38:03,131
I don't want her walking
out here behind us.

488
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:06,434
Copy that. She not going anywhere, boss.

489
00:38:14,198 --> 00:38:15,891
Hello.

490
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:19,689
I see her, west side of the building.
I've got a clear shot.

491
00:38:24,067 --> 00:38:26,334
Boss, I've got a clear shot.

492
00:38:27,056 --> 00:38:28,677
Take it.

493
00:38:47,969 --> 00:38:49,572
Status?

494
00:38:49,993 --> 00:38:51,862
It was a hit.

495
00:38:52,714 --> 00:38:54,518
Lost visual.

496
00:38:56,026 --> 00:38:57,709
Vasco, are we clear?

497
00:38:57,855 --> 00:38:59,479
I've got a body down.

498
00:38:59,833 --> 00:39:01,393
Doorway to the west.

499
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:03,951
Copy that. Connor, call
in with our location,

500
00:39:04,033 --> 00:39:05,921
I want an ambulance in here
on the double.

501
00:39:05,955 --> 00:39:07,866
- I'm on it.
- I'm going in.

502
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:24,392
Jane, report.

503
00:39:26,612 --> 00:39:28,537
Vasco!

504
00:39:39,518 --> 00:39:41,727
Connor, get in here and give me back up.

505
00:39:47,388 --> 00:39:48,959
Andre?

506
00:40:02,112 --> 00:40:03,711
Sarah...

507
00:40:15,478 --> 00:40:17,782
It's not worth it, Sarah!

508
00:40:26,388 --> 00:40:29,585
You were right. We weren't
meant to be together.

509
00:41:03,324 --> 00:41:05,367
Not a good time, Connor.

510
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:09,063
Yeah, we don't get
a lot of those, do we?

511
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,800
I guess what I'm trying
to say is that...

512
00:41:19,052 --> 00:41:20,995
I know how you feel.

513
00:41:26,459 --> 00:41:27,844
Thank you.

514
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:35,814
Sometimes I think this chick
is tougher than both of us.

515
00:41:39,042 --> 00:41:41,327
I've been looking all
over for you guys.

516
00:41:46,678 --> 00:41:49,131
- Am I interrupting?
- No,

517
00:41:49,225 --> 00:41:51,248
I was just telling the boss
how Denver's D line...

518
00:41:51,283 --> 00:41:53,531
is going to shut down
Oakland's passing game.

519
00:41:53,836 --> 00:41:55,992
Oh, yeah, he thinks that
their D.B.'s have lost...

520
00:41:56,093 --> 00:41:58,148
a step or two during the regular season,

521
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:01,224
Oakland is going to find a way
to take a deep.

522
00:42:01,301 --> 00:42:03,151
- Really?
- Yeah.

523
00:42:03,174 --> 00:42:05,175
That's what I say to that.

524
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:09,228
I mean, Denver's running game
is going to eat up the clock...

525
00:42:09,297 --> 00:42:11,116
there's no way they're
losing this one...

526
00:42:11,371 --> 00:42:14,948
All right, well, as truly fascinating
as I do find this,

527
00:42:15,643 --> 00:42:18,820
I think I'm gonna go help Riley
sample the local pub scene.

528
00:42:24,004 --> 00:42:26,727
Our actions,
how we handle ourselves,

529
00:42:26,796 --> 00:42:29,506
how we react to the uncontrollable,

530
00:42:29,576 --> 00:42:31,865
unforeseen forces around us,

531
00:42:32,262 --> 00:42:36,650
is the closest we have
to a true window on the soul.

532
00:42:37,269 --> 00:42:40,558
Actions reflect who we are,
more than words,

533
00:42:40,903 --> 00:42:44,602
confidential files,
or video footage ever will.

534
00:42:44,973 --> 00:42:48,315
You can hide from what you do,
or you can be proud of it,

535
00:42:48,633 --> 00:42:52,532
but you can't deny that
it's a gauge of who you are.

536
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:55,410
Andre gave us a glimpse
through his window,

537
00:42:55,612 --> 00:42:57,416
And if you ask me,

538
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:58,803
in this case,

539
00:42:58,872 --> 00:43:01,127
seeing is believing.
