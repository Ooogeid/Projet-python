00:00:00,775 --> 00:00:02,150
My name is jane vasco.

2
00:00:02,231 --> 00:00:03,908
I could use you
on my team.

3
00:00:03,954 --> 00:00:06,900
I work for a secret government
agency that hunts neuros.

4
00:00:07,272 --> 00:00:10,039
People who can do dangerous
things with their minds.

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:12,641
On my first assignment...

6
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,044
Something a little
weird happened,

7
00:00:15,102 --> 00:00:17,576
okay, something
really weird.

8
00:00:18,501 --> 00:00:22,654
Until i get some answers
i'm getting on with my life,
doing my job.

9
00:00:23,681 --> 00:00:27,753
Stocking up on aspirin,
because let me tell ya,

10
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,984
pain's a bitch!

11
00:01:38,156 --> 00:01:39,612
Make it stop!!!

12
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:40,909
Make it stop!!!

13
00:01:41,591 --> 00:01:42,285
Make it stop!!!

14
00:01:42,424 --> 00:01:43,418
Make it stop!!!

15
00:01:44,817 --> 00:01:46,054
We've got a problem here !

16
00:01:56,761 --> 00:01:57,559
Make it stop!!!

17
00:01:57,726 --> 00:01:58,663
Make it stop!!!

18
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:01,917
What are you waiting for?

19
00:02:03,066 --> 00:02:03,697
Not here.

20
00:02:04,407 --> 00:02:05,910
Not in this house.

21
00:02:06,616 --> 00:02:07,656
Make it stop!!!

22
00:02:12,446 --> 00:02:13,983
This is special field
agent leslie jackson.

23
00:02:14,076 --> 00:02:15,370
Put me through to cooper.

24
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,324
Coop, it's lj.

25
00:02:18,885 --> 00:02:21,220
Whatever it is with
this damn house...

26
00:02:21,821 --> 00:02:23,301
It looks like it's
starting all over again.

27
00:02:29,146 --> 00:02:31,099
What the hell
is your problem?

28
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:44,596

29
00:02:53,697 --> 00:02:54,911
A daily ritual.

30
00:02:55,073 --> 00:02:56,449
Cleansing ourselves.

31
00:02:56,692 --> 00:03:00,091
We wash our hair,
our bodies,
our hands and our teeth.

32
00:03:01,131 --> 00:03:03,709
But with all the lotions,
soaps and shampoos,

33
00:03:04,055 --> 00:03:06,495
none of it seems to reach
below the surface.

34
00:03:07,304 --> 00:03:09,269
So we do our best
to cover up

35
00:03:09,362 --> 00:03:11,304
whatever we're
trying to hide.

36
00:03:11,417 --> 00:03:13,209
But with
so much concealed,

37
00:03:13,474 --> 00:03:16,180
...i often wonder what
it will be like
when it cracks.

38
00:03:16,746 --> 00:03:19,144
And what lies underneath
comes rushing out,

39
00:03:19,213 --> 00:03:20,924
unable to
be contained.

40
00:03:21,999 --> 00:03:23,364
A shot of confidence,

41
00:03:23,456 --> 00:03:25,202
i'm out the door
to face neuros, pain

42
00:03:25,294 --> 00:03:28,666
and unanswered questions
about my special condition.

43
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:31,894
Seventeen maiden lane.

44
00:03:31,975 --> 00:03:32,981
In the dunbar district.

45
00:03:33,085 --> 00:03:34,218
It's an odd little place.

46
00:03:34,264 --> 00:03:35,431
On the market for years.

47
00:03:35,559 --> 00:03:37,096
odd, you mean haunted.

48
00:03:37,177 --> 00:03:38,044
When it wouldn't sell,

49
00:03:38,114 --> 00:03:39,848
the f.b.i. Picked
it up for a song

50
00:03:40,165 --> 00:03:41,922
and reprovisioned it
as a safe house.

51
00:03:42,015 --> 00:03:43,298
Since that time,
four year ago

52
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:44,824
there have been
several "incidents."

53
00:03:44,893 --> 00:03:46,223
what exactly is
an "incident?"

54
00:03:46,385 --> 00:03:49,201
show up at
my place tonight
and i'll demonstrate.

55
00:03:49,247 --> 00:03:51,073
Oh, you mean
a minor incident.

56
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:52,314
Oh.

57
00:03:52,557 --> 00:03:55,389
Several witnesses being
held at the location

58
00:03:55,447 --> 00:03:57,424
experienced some sort
of mental breakdown.

59
00:03:57,646 --> 00:03:58,906
So much for "safe" house.

60
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,802
None of the effects
were permanent.

61
00:04:00,883 --> 00:04:03,704
The victims all recovered
shortly after
leaving the premises.

62
00:04:03,831 --> 00:04:05,438
The bureau's
been thorough.

63
00:04:05,514 --> 00:04:07,433
They've pretty much eliminated
most of the obvious.

64
00:04:07,711 --> 00:04:08,601
Radon.

65
00:04:08,913 --> 00:04:09,514
Mold.

66
00:04:09,584 --> 00:04:09,988
Gasses.

67
00:04:10,035 --> 00:04:12,220
All of it... Eliminated.

68
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,253
So, now the press has this story.

69
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:16,484
Senator moreland is requesting
a special committee

70
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:19,582
to investigate the bureau's
handling of suspects
and witnesses.

71
00:04:19,686 --> 00:04:21,432
They think
the bureau's responsible?

72
00:04:21,513 --> 00:04:24,305
The f.b.i. Has been
accused of using drugs

73
00:04:24,362 --> 00:04:27,070
and "mind control" tactics
to get people to talk.

74
00:04:27,532 --> 00:04:28,746
When they don't give
people the answers,

75
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,549
they will fill in
the blanks.

76
00:04:30,619 --> 00:04:32,017
Think there's
any truth to it?

77
00:04:32,295 --> 00:04:34,226
My contacts at
the bureau say no.

78
00:04:34,353 --> 00:04:36,325
So obviously no one
scanned for neuros.

79
00:04:36,406 --> 00:04:38,984
Obviously, until now.

80
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:45,611
) if we are dealing
with a neuro,

81
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:47,634
we're gonna have
to consider proximity.

82
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:50,224
Riley's downloaded
the city zoning maps.

83
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,976
We've eliminated all
the surrounding neighbors.

84
00:04:57,253 --> 00:04:58,860
Well, I got a map
for the entrances

85
00:04:58,884 --> 00:05:00,190
to the main sewer
lines, if that helps.

86
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:02,144
Alight, you guys cover inside.

87
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:02,988
We'll take the perimeter.

88
00:05:03,034 --> 00:05:05,703
Just in case something
goes bump in the night...

89
00:05:06,442 --> 00:05:09,356
...you'll be outside so
i have nothing to fear.

90
00:05:58,173 --> 00:05:59,537
Did you feel something?

91
00:06:00,554 --> 00:06:02,624
Yeah, a draft.

92
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,283
Upstairs or down?

93
00:06:07,762 --> 00:06:08,363
Up.

94
00:06:09,403 --> 00:06:11,242
I'll check down here.

95
00:06:53,757 --> 00:06:54,924
Basements.

96
00:09:38,214 --> 00:09:39,046
Mom?

97
00:09:43,268 --> 00:09:45,591
Nothing out on the perimeter,
anything here?

98
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,481
Uh, no.

99
00:09:48,761 --> 00:09:50,137
Not that I can find.

100
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,513
Where's maureen?

101
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:53,871
She's downstairs.

102
00:09:55,206 --> 00:09:56,097
You alright?

103
00:09:56,466 --> 00:09:58,224
Yeah, yeah, i'm fine.

104
00:10:01,644 --> 00:10:04,800
and... and that's when you
came up behind me.

105
00:10:04,857 --> 00:10:08,730
And... whatever
it was that I saw...

106
00:10:10,431 --> 00:10:11,275
Wasn't.

107
00:10:13,853 --> 00:10:15,310
What do you mean?

108
00:10:17,552 --> 00:10:19,240
The room was...

109
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:22,197
as it was as it was when
i first came into it.

110
00:10:22,463 --> 00:10:24,613
Why didn't you tell me
this on site?

111
00:10:24,798 --> 00:10:27,543
I was a little freaked
out at the time.

112
00:10:28,977 --> 00:10:31,335
a-and I didn't know what
the hell was going on.

113
00:10:31,439 --> 00:10:32,965
Do you know now?

114
00:10:35,162 --> 00:10:35,624
No.

115
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,838
But i know what i saw.

116
00:10:40,676 --> 00:10:43,685
Ok so the woman
that you saw,
did you see her face?

117
00:10:44,135 --> 00:10:44,575
No, no.

118
00:10:44,621 --> 00:10:47,849
It all happened so fast, and...

119
00:10:50,138 --> 00:10:51,421
She was gone.

120
00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:54,115
Is this her?

121
00:10:55,009 --> 00:10:57,159
Picked these up off
of nsa's satellites.

122
00:10:57,714 --> 00:10:59,742
This was time-stamped
when the last f.b.i.

123
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,829
"incident" occurred.

124
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,650
No, that's not her.

125
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:05,307
I thought you said you
didn't see her face.

126
00:11:05,342 --> 00:11:05,896
Yeah.

127
00:11:07,711 --> 00:11:08,636
I didn't but...

128
00:11:08,683 --> 00:11:12,874
I'm just saying the coloring
and the shape, it's, it's not...


129
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,174
sue me, alright?

130
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:16,665
It's not the woman i saw!

131
00:11:22,117 --> 00:11:23,123
Anyways,

132
00:11:23,456 --> 00:11:26,637
i'm running her against the
facial recognizance database.

133
00:11:27,146 --> 00:11:28,637
Nothing so far.

134
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:30,984
She might've been
just passer by.

135
00:11:33,183 --> 00:11:35,773
Almost makes you start
believing in ghosts.

136
00:11:36,293 --> 00:11:37,680
Well, whatever is
going on in that house

137
00:11:37,715 --> 00:11:39,680
and we're not going
to solve it from down here.

138
00:11:39,726 --> 00:11:41,137
Boss, if you give me
another day...

139
00:11:41,194 --> 00:11:42,780
No, the FBI is under
a lot of pressure.

140
00:11:42,815 --> 00:11:44,619
Hope you didn't make
plans for this weekend.

141
00:11:44,803 --> 00:11:45,913
Pack for a few days.

142
00:11:45,994 --> 00:11:47,428
We're moving in.

143
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:50,514
I told you what i saw.

144
00:11:50,607 --> 00:11:54,202
I don't know why it warrants
a special interrogation.

145
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,645
Is that what you
think this is?

146
00:11:57,986 --> 00:11:59,547
It's what it feels like.

147
00:11:59,616 --> 00:12:02,055
Given everything
you told me,

148
00:12:02,252 --> 00:12:04,849
i have the distinct impression
that you haven't told me everything.

149
00:12:04,918 --> 00:12:06,964
I told you what i saw.

150
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:08,849
But there's more,
isn't there?

151
00:12:08,953 --> 00:12:10,756
What you saw meant
something to you.

152
00:12:10,826 --> 00:12:13,762
Yeah, maybe that
i was losing my mind.

153
00:12:15,513 --> 00:12:16,947
It's so simple,

154
00:12:17,155 --> 00:12:18,923
just tell me what you're
not telling me.

155
00:12:20,993 --> 00:12:23,282
I'm pretty good at
reading my people.

156
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:29,155
Well, maybe you should try
reading one of these.

157
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:33,028
Because you're certainly not doing
a very good job reading me.

158
00:12:36,007 --> 00:12:37,464
You're off the case, jane.

159
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:38,019
What?

160
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:38,609
Why?

161
00:12:39,441 --> 00:12:41,857
Because i believe whatever
you saw in that house
affected you deeply.

162
00:12:41,903 --> 00:12:43,811
So deeply you can
scarcely talk about it,

163
00:12:43,869 --> 00:12:45,637
and that makes
you unreliable.

164
00:12:45,672 --> 00:12:49,061
Hey, i'm the one that heals
and recovers quickly, remember?

165
00:12:49,142 --> 00:12:50,611
Only on the outside.

166
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:52,116
Get some rest.

167
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:54,092
You're sitting
this one out.

168
00:13:00,717 --> 00:13:02,925
the kitchen's fully
stocked if anyone's hungry.

169
00:13:03,018 --> 00:13:04,970
This feel to you guys like
one of those movies

170
00:13:05,055 --> 00:13:07,610
where everybody goes in the old
house and nobody survives

171
00:13:07,691 --> 00:13:08,835
because they all just get...

172
00:13:08,951 --> 00:13:12,223
Riley, whatever's
going on in this house
has a rational explanation.

173
00:13:12,304 --> 00:13:13,890
Yeah... That's exactly what
the scientist always says.

174
00:13:13,936 --> 00:13:16,098
You know what,
he's also always wrong.

175
00:13:16,191 --> 00:13:17,613
We secure here?

176
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:21,150
Just have to finish
up in the basement.

177
00:13:21,231 --> 00:13:22,427
Then do it.

178
00:13:26,993 --> 00:13:29,167
That's great,
just great.

179
00:13:35,768 --> 00:13:38,362
Sure, riley,
we need you on site.

180
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,273
Why don't you just go down
to the basement

181
00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:43,319
set up some
wires and die.

182
00:13:44,048 --> 00:13:45,111
Great idea.

183
00:13:45,227 --> 00:13:46,537
Thanks andre.

184
00:13:49,676 --> 00:13:53,046
These guys ever
watch movies ?

185
00:13:57,239 --> 00:14:00,002
Who the heck goes down
into the basement alone?!

186
00:14:01,887 --> 00:14:04,765
The first guy to get it,
that's who!

187
00:14:19,521 --> 00:14:21,733
Nothing down here,
that's good.

188
00:14:21,822 --> 00:14:24,041
That's easy,
that's easy.

189
00:14:26,203 --> 00:14:28,304
It's fine, it's fine,
it's fine...

190
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,668
The spirit of a dead child.

191
00:14:33,738 --> 00:14:34,755
The spirit of a dead child.

192
00:14:34,801 --> 00:14:35,865
That's the worst.

193
00:14:35,911 --> 00:14:36,905
That's always the worst.

194
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:55,197
Security breach in
the kitchen, security breech!!!

195
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:58,082
I'm on it,
backdoor.

196
00:15:04,524 --> 00:15:05,532
It's okay.

197
00:15:06,665 --> 00:15:08,099
I don't eat much.

198
00:15:11,613 --> 00:15:13,278
We're a team, mcbride.

199
00:15:13,347 --> 00:15:16,388
If you think it's worthy
of a court martial,
go for it.

200
00:15:16,572 --> 00:15:17,671
But i'm in.

201
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,634
Every entry and exit
is covered.

202
00:15:28,773 --> 00:15:30,134
If anyone comes in
or leaves...

203
00:15:30,212 --> 00:15:31,518
They'll activate
the alarm.

204
00:15:31,612 --> 00:15:34,774
These clasps will keep any of
us from activating the system.

205
00:15:34,994 --> 00:15:36,551
We'll work
the "buddy system."

206
00:15:36,599 --> 00:15:37,935
two to a room,
one on watch.

207
00:15:38,045 --> 00:15:41,254
Do we get to draw
straws for our buddy?

208
00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:43,137
Riley, you're
on first watch.

209
00:15:43,231 --> 00:15:44,143
Great!!!

210
00:15:44,647 --> 00:15:45,921
It's always the second
guy that gets it.

211
00:15:46,015 --> 00:15:47,383
If you see or hear
anything...

212
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,374
I know...

213
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,122
Just scream.

214
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:51,380
It won't
be too difficult.

215
00:15:51,474 --> 00:15:52,198
God.

216
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:56,019
On a serious note,
i pulled an i.d.

217
00:15:56,098 --> 00:15:57,435
On that woman who was
in front of the house

218
00:15:57,514 --> 00:15:59,259
when the f.b.i.
Agent lost it.

219
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,516
Anna robeson.

220
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:04,055
She's been near
or around this house
since the incidents began.

221
00:16:04,212 --> 00:16:08,333
This is the first image i
have of her at this site,
captured four years ago.

222
00:16:09,214 --> 00:16:10,204
But this man,

223
00:16:10,388 --> 00:16:12,386
her husband,
karl robeson.

224
00:16:12,464 --> 00:16:13,691
Protected witness?

225
00:16:13,754 --> 00:16:16,097
If he was, the bureau claims
to know nothing about it.

226
00:16:16,379 --> 00:16:17,732
I mean, I've been through
their database.

227
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,882
I can't find
one record,

228
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:22,217
not one that he was
ever brought here
or held in custody.

229
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:24,275
You think the
bureau's covering up?

230
00:16:24,368 --> 00:16:25,189
Or someone on it.

231
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:27,321
Riley, give me a
closer look here.

232
00:16:30,328 --> 00:16:31,368
Mean something to you?

233
00:16:31,472 --> 00:16:32,362
It might.

234
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:35,114
Riley, what else do you
have on karl robeson?

235
00:16:35,183 --> 00:16:37,010
The guy is off
the radar completely.

236
00:16:37,068 --> 00:16:39,046
All i could come up with
is that he did time

237
00:16:39,092 --> 00:16:40,456
at havenhurst for
grand theft auto.

238
00:16:40,895 --> 00:16:42,051
You have a local
for anna robeson?

239
00:16:42,098 --> 00:16:44,933
Still working on
a current address.
I mean...

240
00:16:45,048 --> 00:16:49,014
I don't know
if she's indigent or what,
i'm striking out.

241
00:16:49,106 --> 00:16:50,436
So the broad's a neuro.

242
00:16:50,863 --> 00:16:51,838
Could be.

243
00:16:52,173 --> 00:16:54,416
You find anything
else on anna robeson,
you let me know right away.

244
00:16:54,485 --> 00:16:55,607
Yeah, of course.

245
00:16:55,688 --> 00:16:56,613
Okay, people.

246
00:16:56,705 --> 00:16:57,942
Let's turn in.

247
00:17:00,135 --> 00:17:03,244
Nighty night, don't
let the bed bugs bite.

248
00:17:05,964 --> 00:17:06,773
Good night.

249
00:17:06,843 --> 00:17:07,721
Good night.

250
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:13,076
Don't let
the bed bugs bite.

251
00:18:05,453 --> 00:18:07,938
You sure this is
the right way, lieutenant?

252
00:18:18,933 --> 00:18:20,948
The map says
east, lieutenant.

253
00:18:21,176 --> 00:18:23,581
Yeah,
the map says east, lieutenant.

254
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:28,721
I think you got
this one wrong, boss.

255
00:18:34,745 --> 00:18:36,641
Should of checked the map.

256
00:18:47,633 --> 00:18:48,893
Should have checked the map.

257
00:18:48,974 --> 00:18:50,176
I checked the...

258
00:18:50,218 --> 00:18:51,166
NNoooo!!!!

259
00:18:58,126 --> 00:18:59,929
Side servant's entrance!!!

260
00:19:04,969 --> 00:19:06,853
Alright, what do we got?

261
00:19:07,253 --> 00:19:08,560
Side entrance breech.

262
00:19:09,346 --> 00:19:10,352
Send connor...

263
00:19:10,444 --> 00:19:11,982
They're already on it.
Okay.

264
00:19:12,294 --> 00:19:14,109
You alright?
Yeah !

265
00:19:14,317 --> 00:19:16,941
Look what we
found sneaking around outside.

266
00:19:19,195 --> 00:19:20,339
Anna robeson.

267
00:19:27,184 --> 00:19:29,024
Why are you here,
mrs. Robeson?

268
00:19:29,348 --> 00:19:32,030
Why do you keep
coming back to this house?

269
00:19:32,273 --> 00:19:33,510
Because my husband...

270
00:19:39,417 --> 00:19:40,920
Because karl is here.

271
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:44,596
There's no one
here besides us.

272
00:19:44,897 --> 00:19:47,024
The day those two men
came to take karl...

273
00:19:47,082 --> 00:19:48,307
I followed them.

274
00:19:49,191 --> 00:19:50,717
They brought him
to this house.

275
00:19:50,775 --> 00:19:53,330
I never saw karl after
they brought him here.

276
00:19:53,931 --> 00:19:56,405
They said that they were
investigating him
about a kidnapping.

277
00:19:56,498 --> 00:19:57,781
Karl would never
hurt anyone.

278
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:59,307
The f.b.i. Disagreed.

279
00:19:59,487 --> 00:20:00,990
Karl was different.

280
00:20:01,302 --> 00:20:03,926
And he worked for the people
who lost their daughter.

281
00:20:04,146 --> 00:20:04,805
But if you knew him...

282
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:08,181
What do you mean
"different?"
it's hard to explain.

283
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:09,265
Try.

284
00:20:11,718 --> 00:20:12,990
He could take my hand...

285
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:17,903
And instantly, i'd experience
what karl was feeling.

286
00:20:19,048 --> 00:20:21,374
Joy, pain, sorrow...

287
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,802
Even anger.

288
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:27,197
Husbands and wives
often have those feelings
of being connected.

289
00:20:27,353 --> 00:20:28,995
I know what
you're thinking.

290
00:20:29,157 --> 00:20:30,440
But this was different.

291
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,461
And it wasn't
just with me.

292
00:20:33,006 --> 00:20:35,659
I remember once when we
were out together...

293
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:38,873
It was a beautiful,
wonderful day.

294
00:20:40,526 --> 00:20:43,035
We came across a homeless
man, asking for money.

295
00:20:43,185 --> 00:20:44,769
But one look in his eyes,

296
00:20:44,856 --> 00:20:47,873
you could see that his life
was lacking more than money.

297
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:50,879
Karl handed the man
five dollars.

298
00:20:51,145 --> 00:20:53,867
But he held onto his
hand for a moment.

299
00:20:55,428 --> 00:20:57,601
You could see
the change immediately.

300
00:20:58,665 --> 00:21:01,127
It was as if this
man lit up inside...

301
00:21:02,723 --> 00:21:04,223
His hope was restored.

302
00:21:06,362 --> 00:21:07,830
Karl gave that to him.

303
00:21:08,154 --> 00:21:09,113
It's beautiful.

304
00:21:10,674 --> 00:21:12,917
This son of a bitch sounds
like a chip candidate to me.

305
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:15,004
Karl would never
hurt someone's child.

306
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:15,986
Or anyone.

307
00:21:16,391 --> 00:21:17,408
Mrs. Robeson...

308
00:21:18,576 --> 00:21:20,345
I'm afraid you're going to
have to spend the night here.

309
00:21:20,449 --> 00:21:22,541
We're in the middle of an
investigation and right now...

310
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:23,894
You're a suspect.

311
00:21:23,998 --> 00:21:25,594
I know why you're here.

312
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,242
The things that have
happened in this house.

313
00:21:28,334 --> 00:21:29,340
Karl is here.

314
00:21:32,565 --> 00:21:34,658
Maureen,
would you be so kind

315
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:37,142
as to take mrs. Robeson
up to your room.

316
00:21:37,951 --> 00:21:39,188
Keep an eye on her.

317
00:21:55,783 --> 00:21:56,696
Well, we know she's
telling the truth

318
00:21:56,777 --> 00:21:58,818
about her husband being
brought here.

319
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:01,540
Why would the bureau
lie about that?

320
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:02,828
That's something we'll
have to find out.

321
00:22:02,898 --> 00:22:06,204
I want every scrap of
information you can give me
on karl robeson.

322
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:09,453
You gotta consider that
broad has been around this place

323
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,512
every time something bad
has gone down.

324
00:22:11,614 --> 00:22:12,285
That's right.

325
00:22:12,343 --> 00:22:13,476
Why risk it?

326
00:22:13,998 --> 00:22:15,408
I say we chip her
and ship her.

327
00:22:15,454 --> 00:22:17,489
I do not believe that
she is our neuro.

328
00:22:17,558 --> 00:22:18,553
E.s.p.?

329
00:22:18,969 --> 00:22:20,865
No, she was right here
with us.

330
00:22:21,027 --> 00:22:22,738
She could have had any
one of us at any time.

331
00:22:22,818 --> 00:22:23,870
Why take the chance?!!

332
00:22:23,905 --> 00:22:24,550
Why risk it?

333
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,308
Because i think she
knows something.

334
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,180
Something she's
not telling us.

335
00:22:31,972 --> 00:22:34,492
Jane, would you mind
going upstairs,

336
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:37,206
help maureen keep an eye
on that woman.

337
00:22:40,374 --> 00:22:43,460
If you're right and
she's not a neuro,

338
00:22:46,204 --> 00:22:48,245
what she said about
her husband...

339
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,076
How when he
touched people...

340
00:22:50,366 --> 00:22:51,048
I know.

341
00:22:55,867 --> 00:22:56,317
Yeah.

342
00:22:56,976 --> 00:22:59,173
Had enough of
connor as a roomie?

343
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,635
Just wanted some
time to myself.

344
00:23:03,635 --> 00:23:04,864
You want
to talk about it?

345
00:23:04,957 --> 00:23:06,182
Not really.

346
00:23:09,962 --> 00:23:11,434
Sounds like
you do.

347
00:23:15,396 --> 00:23:16,372
What'd you see?

348
00:23:18,141 --> 00:23:20,095
Saw enough to help
me understand

349
00:23:20,153 --> 00:23:22,530
part of what's going on
in this house.

350
00:23:23,991 --> 00:23:24,669
Which is?

351
00:23:25,101 --> 00:23:27,324
Which is specific
to the individual.

352
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:31,216
Whatever he or she
fears most.

353
00:23:31,898 --> 00:23:34,892
I've been going over
the documented cases in my mind.

354
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:38,125
It was a woman.

355
00:23:38,449 --> 00:23:39,374
The last woman,

356
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,692
she was supposed
to be a witness

357
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,565
in an organized
crime case...

358
00:23:45,351 --> 00:23:46,079
A hemophobic...

359
00:23:46,114 --> 00:23:48,042
That means she fears
of blood...

360
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,674
She saw blood coming
out of the walls.

361
00:23:54,923 --> 00:23:58,102
An agent,
arachnophobic.

362
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:02,712
Could have sworn he saw
scorpions crawling out
from under the bed covers.

363
00:24:04,516 --> 00:24:05,394
And you?

364
00:24:06,423 --> 00:24:07,475
I saw men...

365
00:24:09,013 --> 00:24:10,178
Under my command...

366
00:24:10,744 --> 00:24:12,073
Dying.

367
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:15,172
because I made a mistake.

368
00:24:15,218 --> 00:24:16,686
Something from your past?

369
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:19,091
Not specifically.

370
00:24:22,472 --> 00:24:24,657
But something i live
with every day.

371
00:24:24,852 --> 00:24:27,638
You can't take
responsibility for what
happens to us.

372
00:24:27,927 --> 00:24:29,706
You don't believe
a word of that.

373
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,170
You know if you were
leading this team,

374
00:24:32,216 --> 00:24:34,502
you would feel exactly
the same as i do.

375
00:24:38,484 --> 00:24:40,958
You still haven't told
me what you saw.

376
00:24:43,397 --> 00:24:45,350
I'm not sure
i understand it.

377
00:24:45,431 --> 00:24:47,582
Enough to support
my theory?

378
00:24:49,744 --> 00:24:54,437
When i know,
i'll let you know.

379
00:25:13,427 --> 00:25:14,736
What are you doing here?

380
00:25:15,727 --> 00:25:16,730
How did you find me?

381
00:25:17,658 --> 00:25:18,597
What do you want?!

382
00:25:20,313 --> 00:25:21,287
What do you want?!

383
00:25:23,434 --> 00:25:24,125
No!!!

384
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:28,035
no sign
of connor upstairs.

385
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:28,944
And mrs. Robeson?

386
00:25:29,733 --> 00:25:32,230
Apparently slept
through the night.

387
00:25:32,346 --> 00:25:33,040
No,

388
00:25:34,334 --> 00:25:36,866
i've checked the entire
basement and the outside.

389
00:25:37,121 --> 00:25:39,053
When was the last time
anyone saw connor?

390
00:25:39,317 --> 00:25:41,720
Last night when we took
mrs. Robeson upstairs.

391
00:25:41,766 --> 00:25:42,911
You try his comm?

392
00:25:43,211 --> 00:25:44,101
Nothing.

393
00:25:44,402 --> 00:25:46,136
Did an
ultrasound sweep.

394
00:25:46,205 --> 00:25:46,945
Come on, people!!!

395
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:47,685
Well, where
the hell did he go?

396
00:25:47,708 --> 00:25:50,506
He didn't just
vanish into thin air!

397
00:25:55,315 --> 00:25:56,085
I got him.

398
00:25:56,864 --> 00:25:59,292
Picked up connor's
comm set via gps.

399
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,927
Can you force a connect?

400
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:04,663
I could do that while
i was still in diapers.

401
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:09,391
You're hot.

402
00:26:15,757 --> 00:26:16,187
Connor.

403
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,457
You already know what it's
like to sleep

404
00:26:17,468 --> 00:26:18,763
in a four by six
cinder block room.

405
00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:19,861
You gunning to go back?

406
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:21,827
I'm here, what's up?

407
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:22,881
What's up?

408
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:23,991
Isn't that my question?

409
00:26:24,141 --> 00:26:25,101
Technically, you're awol.

410
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:26,754
Now, I want to know why.

411
00:26:26,904 --> 00:26:28,222
Because hanging around
that house,

412
00:26:28,257 --> 00:26:31,701
waiting for ghostly
apparitions to appear
is a waste of time.

413
00:26:32,017 --> 00:26:33,138
That's my call.

414
00:26:33,196 --> 00:26:35,069
) well, i made my own.

415
00:26:35,149 --> 00:26:36,433
I can do a lot more
in the field

416
00:26:36,479 --> 00:26:38,259
than i can hanging
around that house,

417
00:26:38,317 --> 00:26:40,641
tucked in
with the rest of you.

418
00:26:40,698 --> 00:26:42,421
I think the old broad
was onto something.

419
00:26:42,571 --> 00:26:44,606
There's something
i need to check out.

420
00:26:44,733 --> 00:26:46,726
You saw something
in the house.

421
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:50,483

What did you see ?

422
00:26:52,148 --> 00:26:52,761
Connor!

423
00:26:56,445 --> 00:26:57,162
Damn!

424
00:26:59,439 --> 00:27:00,792
I lost him.

425
00:27:03,277 --> 00:27:04,663
He's off the map.

426
00:27:13,676 --> 00:27:14,913
I'm making a fresh pot.

427
00:27:14,983 --> 00:27:17,584
Dr. Carpenter should be
here in about an hour
to pick you up for analysis.

428
00:27:17,642 --> 00:27:20,266
What is it you
people are afraid of?

429
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:21,583
We just want him
to check you out,

430
00:27:21,629 --> 00:27:24,057
make sure you're in
good health.

431
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:26,461
You're a bad liar,
miss bowers.

432
00:27:26,542 --> 00:27:28,450
But whatever it is you
want me to do, i'll do.

433
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:29,213
Maureen!

434
00:27:29,282 --> 00:27:30,785
I've got something.

435
00:27:31,094 --> 00:27:32,458
I'll be right back.

436
00:27:38,435 --> 00:27:39,995
Is everything alright?
What ?

437
00:27:40,053 --> 00:27:41,672
Hey, mo,
not tomorrow.

438
00:27:41,741 --> 00:27:42,401
Now!

439
00:27:49,453 --> 00:27:50,424
Miss bowers.

440
00:27:51,537 --> 00:27:52,658
Miss bowers.

441
00:27:56,988 --> 00:27:58,688
Everything alright?

442
00:28:03,624 --> 00:28:04,214
Bowers.

443
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:04,942
You alright?

444
00:28:04,988 --> 00:28:06,214
What's wrong?

445
00:28:08,877 --> 00:28:09,651
Maureen?

446
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:10,329
Andre!

447
00:28:11,848 --> 00:28:12,692
You okay?

448
00:28:13,917 --> 00:28:14,481
No,

449
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:19,091
i feel like
i'm losing my mind.

450
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:20,937
It's alright.

451
00:28:21,461 --> 00:28:22,975
It's just the house.

452
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,090
Mom?

453
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,431
I thought you
were at school.

454
00:29:25,032 --> 00:29:26,951
I don't go to
school anymore.

455
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,198
I'm grown up now.

456
00:29:35,723 --> 00:29:37,712
This is always
my favorite time.

457
00:29:38,845 --> 00:29:41,006
When i have
the house to myself.

458
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:44,079
Your father's gone
and you're gone.

459
00:29:44,715 --> 00:29:46,437
And i get to be alone.

460
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:49,651
You like being alone?

461
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,966
It gives me
time to think.

462
00:29:57,505 --> 00:29:59,065
What do you think about?

463
00:30:00,268 --> 00:30:01,643
I think about you.

464
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:06,504
And wonder what's
so wrong about you.

465
00:30:12,666 --> 00:30:14,412
I don't understand.

466
00:30:15,555 --> 00:30:18,792
Can you imagine what it's
like to have a child...

467
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,884
A beautiful child..

468
00:30:23,185 --> 00:30:25,150
Only to find
yourself frightened

469
00:30:25,208 --> 00:30:27,932
by the very thing
you love the most?

470
00:30:29,517 --> 00:30:31,586
You're frightened by me?

471
00:30:33,991 --> 00:30:36,042
You were never like
the other children.

472
00:30:40,048 --> 00:30:43,030
Even before
you could talk,
i knew you were different.

473
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:47,528
All the dreams we
had for a child...

474
00:30:50,258 --> 00:30:54,223
...only to discover that i
was the mother of a freak.

475
00:31:16,448 --> 00:31:17,245
Jane.

476
00:31:18,829 --> 00:31:20,552
Tell me what you saw.

477
00:31:30,561 --> 00:31:32,514
I don't wantto talk about it.

478
00:31:48,357 --> 00:31:49,654
It isn't real.

479
00:31:50,345 --> 00:31:54,218
Whatever you saw,
it's this house.

480
00:31:54,577 --> 00:31:55,397
It's not real.

481
00:32:00,348 --> 00:32:02,822
Some wounds don't
heal so quickly.

482
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:04,730
I understand.

483
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:05,970
But maureen's right.

484
00:32:06,017 --> 00:32:08,444
This house has a way
of getting inside us.

485
00:32:08,525 --> 00:32:10,514
The fear is real...

486
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,421
What you saw is not.

487
00:32:13,513 --> 00:32:14,606
Is there any difference?

488
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:15,443
Yes.

489
00:32:17,224 --> 00:32:18,715
We can conquer...

490
00:32:18,773 --> 00:32:21,679
Or at least learn to live
with our fears.

491
00:32:25,646 --> 00:32:26,904
I'll be alright.

492
00:32:30,224 --> 00:32:31,256
I never doubted it.

493
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:36,690
yeah, yeah...

494
00:32:38,065 --> 00:32:39,406
I'll let him know.

495
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:42,167
Connor's coming in.

496
00:32:42,248 --> 00:32:43,443
He says he's
got something.

497
00:32:43,647 --> 00:32:46,329
And he's bringing it
here for show and tell.

498
00:32:46,376 --> 00:32:46,917
Jane...

499
00:32:48,364 --> 00:32:49,624
Before you freaked...

500
00:32:53,487 --> 00:32:55,707
I mean before
what happened...

501
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:57,533
What did you touch?

502
00:32:58,458 --> 00:32:59,845
What're you talking about?

503
00:33:00,181 --> 00:33:02,123
What'd did you touch?

504
00:33:02,204 --> 00:33:03,614
Did you plug something in?

505
00:33:03,735 --> 00:33:05,261
Turn on a light switch?

506
00:33:06,221 --> 00:33:07,597
I don't know.

507
00:33:08,603 --> 00:33:09,990
I suppose i turned
on the light.

508
00:33:11,446 --> 00:33:12,198
Why?

509
00:33:13,921 --> 00:33:14,395
Andre?

510
00:33:15,378 --> 00:33:16,453
I was making some notes...

511
00:33:16,488 --> 00:33:18,800
I turned off the light
and went to bed.

512
00:33:22,869 --> 00:33:26,062
I was in the kitchen
with anna making coffee.

513
00:33:27,149 --> 00:33:28,582
Is everything all right?

514
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:31,438
I knew it!

515
00:33:31,496 --> 00:33:32,293
I knew it!

516
00:33:32,305 --> 00:33:33,103
I am right again!

517
00:33:33,137 --> 00:33:35,303
I am right again!!!

518
00:33:35,419 --> 00:33:36,852
You going to have
a parade for yourself

519
00:33:36,933 --> 00:33:38,563
or tell us
what's going on?

520
00:33:38,644 --> 00:33:40,066
I just confirmed
with connor.

521
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:42,829
That his mp 3 player
plugged in

522
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:46,762
and he was listening
to music.

523
00:33:47,328 --> 00:33:50,196
Wow, that really
explains it riley.

524
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:54,465
Don't you see,

525
00:33:54,835 --> 00:33:56,499
Whatever it is...

526
00:33:56,731 --> 00:33:58,927
it is in the electricity,

527
00:33:58,996 --> 00:34:01,598
in the circuitry of the house.

528
00:34:02,535 --> 00:34:05,004
So it seemed brilliant
to ask,

529
00:34:05,136 --> 00:34:08,050
how come whatever is
in here didn't touch me?

530
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:11,807
I mean, with all
my equipment plugged in,
the drawing power.

531
00:34:12,433 --> 00:34:14,907
There had to be
a logical explanation.

532
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:16,808
Look at this.

533
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:17,936
Come here.

534
00:34:20,514 --> 00:34:22,503
Andre and jane were upstairs

535
00:34:22,607 --> 00:34:24,956
when whatever
happened, happened.

536
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,260
But me and connor...

537
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:28,174
I'm getting to that.

538
00:34:29,153 --> 00:34:30,818
The light switch
in jane's room,

539
00:34:30,933 --> 00:34:34,031
the lamp in andre's,
the outlet connor used,

540
00:34:34,255 --> 00:34:37,168
they all work
on the same circuit.

541
00:34:38,671 --> 00:34:40,452
The house was re-modelled
at some point

542
00:34:40,521 --> 00:34:46,114
and there was too much power
to draw from one circuit
so they split it off.

543
00:34:46,803 --> 00:34:50,977
The coffee machine
works on
the same damn circuit.

544
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:55,717
Except for this
room and my gear.

545
00:34:56,017 --> 00:34:59,120
Riley, you're out on a
pretty big limb with this.

546
00:34:59,328 --> 00:35:00,241
Think about it.

547
00:35:00,993 --> 00:35:03,265
Why does chipping
work on neuros?

548
00:35:03,617 --> 00:35:05,986
Because neurological
activity is...

549
00:35:06,357 --> 00:35:07,180
Electrical.

550
00:35:07,316 --> 00:35:08,061
Electrical...

551
00:35:08,276 --> 00:35:08,939
Exactly.

552
00:35:09,563 --> 00:35:15,863
The chip can
interferes or shortcircuit
a connection in the brain.

553
00:35:16,037 --> 00:35:25,126
All the wiring goes to a breaker
box located in the basement.

554
00:35:25,658 --> 00:35:28,114
Hell, guys,
it's worth a look.

555
00:35:31,305 --> 00:35:32,241
Okay...

556
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,513
It should be here,
right along this wall.

557
00:35:44,084 --> 00:35:45,148
It's hollow.

558
00:35:45,807 --> 00:35:47,495
It's just painted drywall.

559
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:50,614
It looks like a door
that's been boarded up.

560
00:35:51,042 --> 00:35:53,388
Help me get this
thing out of the way.

561
00:36:19,664 --> 00:36:21,165
Alright, get back.

562
00:36:38,974 --> 00:36:39,760
Whoa.

563
00:36:40,246 --> 00:36:41,310
Different circuit.

564
00:36:49,066 --> 00:36:50,107
What do you
make of this?

565
00:36:50,153 --> 00:36:51,885
It's an
interrogation room.

566
00:36:52,454 --> 00:36:55,437
Crude, but familiar.

567
00:37:02,234 --> 00:37:04,562
I see you found
camp's playground.

568
00:37:05,758 --> 00:37:07,099
This is russell camp.

569
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:10,394
Assistant special
agent in charge

570
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,452
of the northeast
division of the f.b.i.

571
00:37:12,509 --> 00:37:13,516
Who are you people?

572
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:17,357
I thought i told you that
we're asking the questions.

573
00:37:18,213 --> 00:37:20,144
Alright connor,
what's going on?

574
00:37:21,554 --> 00:37:23,219
I saw something
last night.

575
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,664
Something from my past.

576
00:37:25,942 --> 00:37:26,994
Someone i hurt.

577
00:37:28,219 --> 00:37:30,358
Which helped me rember
who this piece of garbage was.

578
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:31,699
You know him?

579
00:37:32,358 --> 00:37:33,225
I know of him.

580
00:37:34,404 --> 00:37:35,375
When i was
in the joint,

581
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:37,630
cops would be investigated
by the bushel.

582
00:37:37,745 --> 00:37:40,054
Campy here was
working local p.d.

583
00:37:40,473 --> 00:37:43,306
And was accused of
some very bad things.

584
00:37:43,641 --> 00:37:44,520
What kind of things?

585
00:37:45,762 --> 00:37:48,733
Let's just say
that his interrogation
techniques were...

586
00:37:50,086 --> 00:37:51,172
Unconventional.

587
00:37:51,299 --> 00:37:54,583
This is the agents
who brought anna's husband
to this house.

588
00:37:56,719 --> 00:37:59,133
He and his partner,
dwight elkins.

589
00:37:59,493 --> 00:38:00,765
Why lie about it?

590
00:38:00,846 --> 00:38:01,637
Isn't it obvious?

591
00:38:01,852 --> 00:38:05,447
He and elkins wanted to get
away from f.b.i. Headquarters

592
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:08,349
so they could conduct
their interrogations

593
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:10,803
so no eyebrows
would be raised.

594
00:38:11,115 --> 00:38:12,572
A five-year old
girl was missing.

595
00:38:12,595 --> 00:38:14,235
We didn't know if she
was dead or alive.

596
00:38:14,769 --> 00:38:16,063
Robeson wanted
to lawyer up.

597
00:38:16,156 --> 00:38:17,231
So you tortured him.

598
00:38:17,312 --> 00:38:18,704
We were trying to
extract information.

599
00:38:18,785 --> 00:38:19,860
Alright...

600
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:21,698
What happened?

601
00:38:21,918 --> 00:38:24,669
He said he didn't know anything
about the kidnapping
and we let him go.

602
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:46,042
Look at this!!

603
00:38:50,319 --> 00:38:52,851
You better talk,
you son of a bitch!!!

604
00:38:54,191 --> 00:38:56,815
There was a girl's life
at stake, for godsake!

605
00:38:57,648 --> 00:38:58,388
Here we go.

606
00:38:58,446 --> 00:38:59,914
Alright!!! Alright!!

607
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,720
Nobody...

608
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:06,584
Nobody thought anything
was going to happen to him, ok?

609
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:08,387
We roughed him
up a little.

610
00:39:09,928 --> 00:39:12,552
Dwight gave him a jolt
from the charger.

611
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:14,970
Nobody knew his heart
was going to stop.

612
00:39:15,063 --> 00:39:16,404
We didn't know.

613
00:39:16,866 --> 00:39:18,092
So you killed him?

614
00:39:18,924 --> 00:39:20,092
He died, yeah.

615
00:39:20,612 --> 00:39:21,572
You and elkins...

616
00:39:21,641 --> 00:39:25,236
You got rid of the body,
walled the place up,
you didn't tell the f.b.i.

617
00:39:25,305 --> 00:39:26,477
That you'd even
questioned the man.

618
00:39:26,547 --> 00:39:29,219
They ended up catching
the kidnappers.

619
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:30,732
Two weeks later.

620
00:39:31,171 --> 00:39:33,009
Still had the
kid with him.

621
00:39:33,391 --> 00:39:35,377
Robeson had nothing
to do with it.

622
00:39:35,587 --> 00:39:36,790
Given your future,

623
00:39:36,847 --> 00:39:37,818
he might've made
the right choice.

624
00:39:37,888 --> 00:39:39,067
Connor, call the f.b.i.

625
00:39:39,113 --> 00:39:40,535
And tell them to pick
up this piece of garbage.

626
00:39:40,593 --> 00:39:43,627
Congratulations, pal,
you are first in line

627
00:39:43,684 --> 00:39:45,922
for the senate
investigation committee.

628
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,352
I love you, anna.

629
00:40:15,623 --> 00:40:18,293
Everything anna robeson
described about her husband,

630
00:40:18,941 --> 00:40:22,397
how he could pass on
his moods and emotions...

631
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:24,890
Sound like a neuro to me?

632
00:40:24,971 --> 00:40:27,202
Alright, let's say he was.

633
00:40:27,895 --> 00:40:30,572
So in his last moment,
he's electrocuted.

634
00:40:31,329 --> 00:40:35,354
All his pain, his fear,
his last emotions...

635
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,684
All which are
brain activity...

636
00:40:38,776 --> 00:40:39,670
And electrical...

637
00:40:40,684 --> 00:40:43,414
Passed into the circuitry
of this house.

638
00:40:43,487 --> 00:40:45,691
So you're saying
the house is a neuro?

639
00:40:46,273 --> 00:40:47,267
I don't know.

640
00:40:48,192 --> 00:40:51,036
But it seems everyone who came
in contact with that circuit

641
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:54,925
seemed to experience their
own pain and fear...

642
00:40:56,391 --> 00:40:59,102
As if karl robeson was still
able to transmit emotion.

643
00:40:59,166 --> 00:40:59,778
So what?

644
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:02,347
You're saying we should
chip the house?

645
00:41:02,439 --> 00:41:03,491
This is nuts.

646
00:41:04,197 --> 00:41:05,780
You have a better
explanation?

647
00:41:05,827 --> 00:41:07,572
Wait, at the end...

648
00:41:07,734 --> 00:41:09,237
That wasn't camp's voice.

649
00:41:09,387 --> 00:41:11,609
I'll bet even money that
whatever was wrong

650
00:41:11,644 --> 00:41:13,424
with this house,
isn't wrong anymore.

651
00:41:13,505 --> 00:41:17,218
Carl robeson escaped this
house through camp,
the man who killed him.

652
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:20,051
Alright, are you willing to put
your money where your mouth is?

653
00:41:20,166 --> 00:41:20,640
Yes, i am.

654
00:41:20,698 --> 00:41:21,369
Let's go.

655
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:21,975
Follow me.

656
00:41:22,108 --> 00:41:22,652
After you.

657
00:41:22,918 --> 00:41:23,981
Keep talking.

658
00:41:24,388 --> 00:41:26,041
Alright,
you fill my wallet.

659
00:41:33,105 --> 00:41:34,492
You just turned
it on, right?

660
00:41:34,618 --> 00:41:36,167
Flicked the switch.

661
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:42,630
Alright.

662
00:42:00,641 --> 00:42:01,520
Oh, no!!!

663
00:42:01,846 --> 00:42:02,568
Oh God !

664
00:42:03,175 --> 00:42:04,551
Oh God ! Anything but that!

665
00:42:04,644 --> 00:42:05,164
Riley !

666
00:42:05,222 --> 00:42:06,181
Anything but that !

667
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:07,407
What is it ? 
What's wrong ?

668
00:42:07,672 --> 00:42:08,794
What's wrong?

669
00:42:09,453 --> 00:42:10,274
It's...

670
00:42:10,773 --> 00:42:12,196
It's decaf!

671
00:42:13,235 --> 00:42:14,588
I hate decaf.

672
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:15,377
I will get you for that.

673
00:42:15,435 --> 00:42:16,036
I'm sorry.

674
00:42:24,213 --> 00:42:25,408
A president once said,

675
00:42:25,503 --> 00:42:27,798
"we have nothing to fear
but fear itself."

676
00:42:28,236 --> 00:42:32,106
andre, one of the
strongest men i know,
admitted his fear to me.

677
00:42:32,355 --> 00:42:35,407
Even maureen admitted her
fear of losing control,

678
00:42:36,023 --> 00:42:39,644
i think my greatest
weakness is the fear
that i'll be seen as weak.

679
00:42:40,342 --> 00:42:41,194
But i have to wonder,

680
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:42,851
if the vulnerable
aren't the strong.

681
00:42:43,028 --> 00:42:45,424
And if those who wear
their strength like a shield,

682
00:42:45,712 --> 00:42:47,476
the weak
and frightened.

683
00:42:47,594 --> 00:42:48,079
Hey.

684
00:42:51,961 --> 00:42:53,902
I think
i am ready to talk.

685
00:42:55,883 --> 00:42:56,806
Come on in.

686
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,900
