1
00:00:00,749 --> 00:00:02,121
My name is jane vasco.

2
00:00:02,217 --> 00:00:03,614
I could use you on my team.

3
00:00:03,676 --> 00:00:07,232
I work for a secret government
agency that hunts neuros.

4
00:00:07,291 --> 00:00:10,354
People who can do dangerous
things with their minds.

5
00:00:11,232 --> 00:00:12,588
On my first assignment...

6
00:00:12,635 --> 00:00:15,045
Something a little weird happened,

7
00:00:15,093 --> 00:00:18,141
okay, something really weird.

8
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:21,418
Until I get some answers
I'm getting on with my life,

9
00:00:21,769 --> 00:00:22,727
doing my job.

10
00:00:23,365 --> 00:00:25,248
Stocking up on aspirin,

11
00:00:25,343 --> 00:00:28,312
because let me tell ya,

12
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:29,812
pain's a bitch !

13
00:00:30,234 --> 00:00:31,415
Riley, what's happening ?

14
00:00:33,681 --> 00:00:36,250
System is down,
backed up and secure.

15
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:37,821
We going somewhere ?

16
00:00:38,491 --> 00:00:40,709
Nice if there were a neuro
or two in maul.

17
00:00:41,029 --> 00:00:43,905
I don't think you'll be sipping
a lot of mal-tais in hungary.

18
00:00:47,691 --> 00:00:48,728
No cracks.

19
00:00:49,031 --> 00:00:49,941
I didn't say anything ?

20
00:00:50,021 --> 00:00:51,138
It's a pre-emptive strike.

21
00:00:51,186 --> 00:00:52,574
I do have a life above ground.

22
00:00:52,638 --> 00:00:53,021
Clearly.

23
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:54,204
What's the 911 ?

24
00:00:54,283 --> 00:00:55,815
We have an emergency
situation at nico.

25
00:00:55,898 --> 00:00:57,714
Morgan informs me
there's been a break.

26
00:00:57,795 --> 00:00:58,416
How many ?

27
00:00:58,448 --> 00:00:59,757
Six that we're aware of.

28
00:00:59,831 --> 00:01:00,246
When ?

29
00:01:00,374 --> 00:01:01,076
We don't know.

30
00:01:01,362 --> 00:01:03,848
There have been administrative
problems at nico for months now.

31
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:04,997
Morgan's thinks they've
been sweeping things

32
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,021
under the carpet.

33
00:01:06,141 --> 00:01:07,634
In any case, I can't tell you when

34
00:01:07,722 --> 00:01:09,254
because no official
report was made.

35
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:11,033
Morgan picked this up
from other sources.

36
00:01:11,097 --> 00:01:12,214
Can't the locals handle it ?

37
00:01:12,278 --> 00:01:13,028
There are no locals.

38
00:01:13,107 --> 00:01:14,176
These neuros have been chipped,

39
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,688
so there's minimal security.

40
00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:18,241
The other staff are
administrators, doctors, nurses.

41
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,043
The flight leaves at 0600.

42
00:01:20,091 --> 00:01:21,591
That's four hours from now.

43
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:22,500
Pack light.

44
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,725
Seth, I'm going to need riley
where we're going

45
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:26,131
so there'll be no one here
to run security.

46
00:01:26,147 --> 00:01:27,599
I'm going to get joe
to do a lock up here.

47
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,162
I'll be at the hospital
if you need me.

48
00:01:29,337 --> 00:01:29,864
Thank you.

49
00:01:30,135 --> 00:01:32,066
Farber air force base at 0500.

50
00:01:32,345 --> 00:01:32,903
Let's roll.

51
00:02:07,542 --> 00:02:10,288
Nice to meet you, agent mcbride.

52
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:12,247
Make yourself comfortable.

53
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,034
I do understand why you're
here and I assure you,

54
00:02:17,089 --> 00:02:19,332
you and your team will have
my full cooperation.

55
00:02:19,455 --> 00:02:20,723
That won't be necessary.

56
00:02:21,921 --> 00:02:24,234
We're planning on performing
a thorough house-cleaning.

57
00:02:24,693 --> 00:02:26,654
Just how thorough
are we talking about ?

58
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,065
From the top down.

59
00:02:58,901 --> 00:02:59,694
Cozy.

60
00:02:59,926 --> 00:03:03,082
Oh, yeah, all we need
is some villagers and torches.

61
00:03:14,576 --> 00:03:15,378
Roger armstrong.

62
00:03:15,525 --> 00:03:16,240
Andre mcbride.

63
00:03:16,414 --> 00:03:17,547
We've been expecting you.

64
00:03:17,935 --> 00:03:18,885
And let me assure you,

65
00:03:18,926 --> 00:03:21,073
you and your team will have
my full cooperation.

66
00:03:22,163 --> 00:03:24,209
I would expect nothing less,
mr. Armstrong.

67
00:03:24,263 --> 00:03:26,439
I'll gather my team after
they've had a chance to settle,

68
00:03:26,499 --> 00:03:28,394
and we'll reconvene
in your office in one hour.

69
00:03:34,198 --> 00:03:40,109
Transcript : swsub.com
Synchro : bbd1980

70
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:44,282
I used to dream of
traveling as a kid...

71
00:03:44,366 --> 00:03:46,855
Places like hawaii,
the caribbean...

72
00:03:47,205 --> 00:03:50,387
White sand beaches,
toes digging in the sand,

73
00:03:50,449 --> 00:03:52,168
a cute guy to my side.

74
00:03:52,745 --> 00:03:54,973
I thought this might be
the year I'd make that happen.

75
00:03:56,561 --> 00:03:58,040
Guess I was wrong...

76
00:03:58,539 --> 00:03:59,380
Again.

77
00:04:01,734 --> 00:04:03,328
We first became aware of
the situation

78
00:04:03,355 --> 00:04:04,574
at evening bed check.

79
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,223
We have a very strict curfew.

80
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,895
Obviously, not strict enough.

81
00:04:07,974 --> 00:04:10,358
We have a limited security
staff, agent mcbride.

82
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,164
Most of our residents,
having been chipped,

83
00:04:12,482 --> 00:04:13,318
are well-behaved.

84
00:04:13,427 --> 00:04:14,902
Why didn't you report
the situation ?

85
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,041
We had hoped we could
bring them back

86
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,413
without causing concern.

87
00:04:18,184 --> 00:04:20,196
I take full responsibility
for what happened.

88
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:21,958
Oh, it's already been
assigned to you.

89
00:04:22,577 --> 00:04:25,040
My orders are to locate
and contain the escapees.

90
00:04:25,108 --> 00:04:26,678
At the same time,
the entire operation

91
00:04:26,797 --> 00:04:28,168
will be evaluated.

92
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:30,730
From security to management.

93
00:04:30,802 --> 00:04:32,013
Expect changes.

94
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,579
It's 1125 hours.

95
00:04:33,643 --> 00:04:35,207
My team will need to be briefed.

96
00:04:35,366 --> 00:04:36,308
15 minutes.

97
00:04:38,051 --> 00:04:40,153
This is alex rawlings,
head of security.

98
00:04:40,265 --> 00:04:42,576
I've read the intel
report you compiled.

99
00:04:43,141 --> 00:04:45,413
Not much detail about how
the escapes were accomplished.

100
00:04:45,584 --> 00:04:46,899
You know everything that we know.

101
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:48,537
There's no evidence whatsoever

102
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:49,503
that they breached the perimeter.

103
00:04:49,547 --> 00:04:52,691
I find it highly unlikely that
they walked through the walls.

104
00:04:53,654 --> 00:04:54,022
Yes, sir.

105
00:04:54,058 --> 00:04:56,156
I'll need blueprints,
from the roof to the basement,

106
00:04:56,192 --> 00:04:57,362
and the surrounding property.

107
00:04:57,453 --> 00:04:58,729
I have them digitized,
if you'd like...

108
00:04:58,749 --> 00:05:00,173
Riley, download it to your rig,

109
00:05:00,193 --> 00:05:01,293
I want to keep it portable.

110
00:05:01,349 --> 00:05:02,836
It gives us an edge
for security purposes

111
00:05:02,877 --> 00:05:03,816
plus we may have to roll with it.

112
00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:04,584
I'm on it.

113
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,288
Go on.

114
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,715
I've arranged for dr. Phillips,
head of medicine,

115
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:11,279
to show you
the rest of the facility.

116
00:05:11,329 --> 00:05:13,547
He's better qualified
to answer your questions.

117
00:05:13,937 --> 00:05:15,118
If there's nothing else...

118
00:05:15,245 --> 00:05:16,602
Not for the moment.

119
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:23,648
We run quite a number of
tests and experiments.

120
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:26,968
An inmate would be placed
depending on what phase

121
00:05:26,996 --> 00:05:28,749
of testing he or she is in.

122
00:05:29,302 --> 00:05:30,576
What kind of tests ?

123
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:33,296
Everything from mri's to cat scans.

124
00:05:33,353 --> 00:05:36,220
We do perform some
invasive surgeries.

125
00:05:36,277 --> 00:05:40,420
The main focus of our research
is to determine etymology.

126
00:05:40,484 --> 00:05:43,197
We still have no idea
where, how or why

127
00:05:43,261 --> 00:05:45,452
the phenomenon began to
appear in the population.

128
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:47,575
You let them walk
around like this ?

129
00:05:47,671 --> 00:05:50,335
They're human beings, agent king.

130
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,459
And, having had the good
fortune to have been chipped,

131
00:05:52,538 --> 00:05:53,400
quite harmless.

132
00:05:53,448 --> 00:05:54,874
I don't like it.

133
00:05:54,946 --> 00:05:56,481
Hell, they know who we are.

134
00:05:56,581 --> 00:05:59,300
And probably aren't too happy
about seeing us again.

135
00:05:59,496 --> 00:06:00,958
This is yellow sector.

136
00:06:01,022 --> 00:06:03,430
These are our longest
term residents.

137
00:06:03,477 --> 00:06:06,040
Most have been through
the complete battery of tests.

138
00:06:06,128 --> 00:06:08,418
This is our minimal
security section,

139
00:06:08,465 --> 00:06:09,997
primarily for containment.

140
00:06:10,221 --> 00:06:12,455
And still well-covered
with security cameras.

141
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:16,161
Yes, every sector is covered
and the cameras run 24/7.

142
00:06:17,829 --> 00:06:18,858
What's blue, doctor ?

143
00:06:18,896 --> 00:06:21,427
Our central core is at
the end of that corridor.

144
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:24,657
Every section extends off
the core like spokes on a wheel.

145
00:06:25,308 --> 00:06:27,402
It's also our path
lab and safe room.

146
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:28,448
Safe room ?

147
00:06:28,783 --> 00:06:30,355
Yes, just in case.

148
00:06:30,403 --> 00:06:31,823
What makes it safe ?

149
00:06:32,127 --> 00:06:34,140
We've discovered during
our research

150
00:06:34,191 --> 00:06:36,778
that an extremely amplified
ultrasonic wave

151
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:39,856
can interfere with the aberrant
neurological activity...

152
00:06:39,902 --> 00:06:41,542
Limiting its range and efficacy.

153
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:42,634
Like a chip.

154
00:06:42,893 --> 00:06:47,117
Yes, very much like a chip but
not localized to the individual.

155
00:06:47,357 --> 00:06:50,679
If there ever were to be some
sort of threat to the staff,

156
00:06:50,774 --> 00:06:53,344
if a chip were to fail
we can surround that room

157
00:06:53,407 --> 00:06:55,626
with an ultrasonic barrier
that would, in effect,

158
00:06:55,673 --> 00:06:58,370
prevent their "special talents"
from getting through.

159
00:06:58,546 --> 00:06:59,976
Have you ever had a chip fail ?

160
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,325
No, not to date.

161
00:07:01,612 --> 00:07:03,718
Why not use the ultrasonic
throughout the entire facility ?

162
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:05,005
A number of reasons.

163
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:08,537
The power involved to generate
the frequency and amplify it.

164
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:10,947
That, and the intensity of
the frequency could be harmful

165
00:07:11,027 --> 00:07:13,005
to the physical structure
of the building.

166
00:07:13,085 --> 00:07:14,817
That section has been reinforced.

167
00:07:19,268 --> 00:07:20,373
This is red sector.

168
00:07:20,484 --> 00:07:22,099
It's our highest security section.

169
00:07:22,227 --> 00:07:23,880
The inmates here, albeit chipped,

170
00:07:23,971 --> 00:07:26,461
are considered dangerous
and anti-social.

171
00:07:26,621 --> 00:07:28,240
Have you found any
connection between

172
00:07:28,269 --> 00:07:29,850
their behavior
and their condition ?

173
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,151
Nothing consistent.

174
00:07:31,227 --> 00:07:33,231
Apparently, the aberration
itself does not cause

175
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,391
anti-social behavior.

176
00:07:34,862 --> 00:07:36,621
I believe these people
would have been incarcerated

177
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,175
in the outside world,
even if they did not possess

178
00:07:39,215 --> 00:07:41,401
their "special talents".

179
00:07:43,315 --> 00:07:44,517
Well, well, well...

180
00:07:45,201 --> 00:07:47,275
This place is looking
better already.

181
00:07:48,312 --> 00:07:50,786
I told you I'd kill you
if I ever got the chance,

182
00:07:50,818 --> 00:07:51,823
you sonuvabitch.

183
00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:54,217
Ahhh !!!

184
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,742
I remember you.

185
00:07:56,835 --> 00:07:59,359
You're the pyro freak who likes
to set fire to schools.

186
00:07:59,794 --> 00:08:00,913
You bit me !

187
00:08:01,077 --> 00:08:02,957
And last time I checked
I had rabies.

188
00:08:10,638 --> 00:08:11,899
What's the green sector ?

189
00:08:13,803 --> 00:08:15,019
Maintenance.

190
00:08:15,705 --> 00:08:17,764
Generator, hospital supply rooms,

191
00:08:17,828 --> 00:08:19,743
nothing of any real interest.

192
00:08:20,094 --> 00:08:21,913
) Dr. Phillips, please, dr. Phillips.

193
00:08:22,555 --> 00:08:23,893
Excuse me.

194
00:08:24,664 --> 00:08:25,278
Yes.

195
00:08:26,142 --> 00:08:28,483
Yes, I'll be right there.

196
00:08:37,352 --> 00:08:38,437
What've you got ?

197
00:08:38,581 --> 00:08:41,182
I've been over the security
tapes and reports.

198
00:08:41,214 --> 00:08:42,283
On the night of the escape,

199
00:08:42,347 --> 00:08:44,280
none of the entrances or exits
were breached.

200
00:08:44,385 --> 00:08:45,577
Still leaves us nowhere.

201
00:08:45,955 --> 00:08:47,262
Not exactly.

202
00:08:47,478 --> 00:08:49,333
There's a tunnel that
runs below the facility.

203
00:08:49,717 --> 00:08:50,791
Where does it lead ?

204
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:53,031
To an old convent about
two miles from here.

205
00:08:53,273 --> 00:08:54,229
A few centuries back,

206
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:56,775
this place was a prison used
to house religious prisoners.

207
00:08:56,975 --> 00:08:58,238
The tunnel was built
as a means for them

208
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,458
to communicate with and
escape to the outside world.

209
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:02,383
And you didn't think
it was worth checking ?

210
00:09:02,599 --> 00:09:03,171
No need.

211
00:09:03,312 --> 00:09:04,569
It was sealed almost 200 years ago

212
00:09:04,595 --> 00:09:05,718
when it was discovered.

213
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:07,943
When we took possession,
the closure was reinforced.

214
00:09:08,124 --> 00:09:10,002
It's been filled with
a few tons of concrete.

215
00:09:11,409 --> 00:09:13,575
No exits breached,
the tunnels are blocked.

216
00:09:14,343 --> 00:09:16,036
How the hell did
six neuros escape ?

217
00:09:28,577 --> 00:09:29,923
You've been quiet.

218
00:09:30,415 --> 00:09:31,385
Something on your mind ?

219
00:09:31,995 --> 00:09:34,293
One guard I saw was
carrying a chip gun.

220
00:09:35,392 --> 00:09:36,302
Wouldn't you ?

221
00:09:36,382 --> 00:09:38,361
Why? Everyone here is chipped.

222
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:41,000
Dr. Phillips said he'd never
heard of a chip failing

223
00:09:41,031 --> 00:09:43,552
but they built a safe
room just in case.

224
00:09:44,603 --> 00:09:47,923
Even so, the guard I saw was
coming from a maintenance area

225
00:09:48,162 --> 00:09:49,901
of no real interest.

226
00:09:50,508 --> 00:09:52,941
You're thinking their
full cooperation

227
00:09:53,021 --> 00:09:54,648
might not be so full.

228
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:58,290
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.

229
00:10:35,031 --> 00:10:36,658
rawlings said
the tunnel was sealed.

230
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,008
What do guys expect
we're going to find here ?

231
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:41,115
No dates for this weekend,
that's for sure.

232
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:49,528
I wasn't expecting visitors today.

233
00:10:49,831 --> 00:10:51,140
My name is andre mcbride.

234
00:10:51,303 --> 00:10:52,672
I am mother superior.

235
00:10:53,084 --> 00:10:55,668
My team and I are doing
historical research in the area

236
00:10:55,698 --> 00:10:56,985
and we were wondering
if we could check out

237
00:10:57,087 --> 00:10:58,348
the building and the grounds.

238
00:10:58,539 --> 00:11:02,292
If it doesn't interfere with
the sisters, I see no problem.

239
00:11:06,543 --> 00:11:08,138
This place is amazing.

240
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,580
How old is it ?

241
00:11:11,489 --> 00:11:14,164
It's been here
for almost 400 years.

242
00:11:14,688 --> 00:11:16,115
We understand there is a tunnel

243
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,561
that runs under the property.

244
00:11:19,286 --> 00:11:19,993
Yes.

245
00:11:20,534 --> 00:11:22,149
Do you have any idea
where it leads ?

246
00:11:22,924 --> 00:11:24,965
Someplace that used to be a prison.

247
00:11:25,439 --> 00:11:27,121
Would you mind if
we took a look at it ?

248
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:28,172
Of course.

249
00:11:32,161 --> 00:11:33,549
The walls are completely sealed.

250
00:11:33,613 --> 00:11:35,464
No way anyone came
through that tunnel.

251
00:11:40,044 --> 00:11:40,842
Hey boss.

252
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:42,502
Thank you.

253
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,113
No, I'm working.

254
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,550
What do you got ?

255
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:48,419
I've officially confirmed
the names of the escapees.

256
00:11:48,524 --> 00:11:49,734
Luckily, these people are chipped.

257
00:11:49,777 --> 00:11:51,501
Because they'd make an
all-star team of neuros

258
00:11:51,552 --> 00:11:52,675
if they weren't.

259
00:11:52,982 --> 00:11:56,268
First there's jakob
baumgartner, shape shifter,

260
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,025
who I believe we all rember.

261
00:11:58,117 --> 00:11:59,851
Then there's jerry williams.

262
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:03,987
Neuro ability; the man can
move at extremely high speeds.

263
00:12:04,776 --> 00:12:07,090
Marilyn smith, neuro ability,

264
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:09,021
she can emit highly-focused
lasebeams

265
00:12:09,053 --> 00:12:12,165
produced from a region behind
the optic nerve.

266
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:16,429
Bill davis, can cause a magnetic
force between objects.

267
00:12:17,626 --> 00:12:21,600
Tom sampson, can create
ultrasonic vibrations.

268
00:12:22,716 --> 00:12:25,030
And last, but not least,
roger hanley,

269
00:12:25,525 --> 00:12:26,578
a levitator.

270
00:12:26,642 --> 00:12:28,029
We're on our way to you now.

271
00:12:31,012 --> 00:12:32,161
No worries, boss.

272
00:12:32,754 --> 00:12:34,812
Three other break-ins have
occurred since the escape.

273
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:37,177
Oversized drill bits
stolen from a machine factory,

274
00:12:37,432 --> 00:12:39,411
several boxes of
c-4 explosive taken

275
00:12:39,475 --> 00:12:41,741
from a ming factory, nothing else.

276
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,977
But check this out;

277
00:12:43,608 --> 00:12:45,180
a cache of guns
and ammo were stolen

278
00:12:45,259 --> 00:12:47,637
from a highly secure military
munitions storage shed.

279
00:12:47,964 --> 00:12:49,081
Given the details,

280
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:50,900
those escaped neuros
could've pulled this off.

281
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:52,774
How ? they're all chipped.

282
00:12:52,854 --> 00:12:53,373
Maybe.

283
00:12:53,551 --> 00:12:55,402
Andre, you said they've
been experimenting

284
00:12:55,498 --> 00:12:56,535
with de-chping here.

285
00:12:56,694 --> 00:12:57,620
It's not a secret.

286
00:12:57,668 --> 00:12:59,448
But it's not a known
fact that they can do it.

287
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,098
Not known to us, anyway.

288
00:13:01,513 --> 00:13:03,396
Might explain what we were
talking about earlier.

289
00:13:03,726 --> 00:13:05,194
Worth discussing with armstrong.

290
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,143
Doesn't track.

291
00:13:06,351 --> 00:13:07,826
If you managed to get
out of this place,

292
00:13:07,872 --> 00:13:08,824
would you stick around ?

293
00:13:09,426 --> 00:13:11,034
Personally, I'd get my
ass as far away from

294
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:12,367
here as possible.

295
00:13:12,438 --> 00:13:14,624
Unless escaping isn't
the only thing on their mind.

296
00:13:18,056 --> 00:13:19,384
You are correct, agent mcbride,

297
00:13:19,435 --> 00:13:21,439
we have experimented
with de-chipping.

298
00:13:21,478 --> 00:13:24,083
But those experiments were
discontinued long before

299
00:13:24,131 --> 00:13:25,567
they garnered results.

300
00:13:25,726 --> 00:13:27,782
I've got a list of burglaries
that could have been committed

301
00:13:27,816 --> 00:13:29,811
by those neuros
had they been de-chipped.

302
00:13:30,453 --> 00:13:31,746
You have my answer, agent.

303
00:13:31,792 --> 00:13:32,792
And you have mine.

304
00:13:33,805 --> 00:13:36,008
We could be looking at an
attempt for a full-scale breakout.

305
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,920
Until otherwise notified,
I'm putting nico on 24/7

306
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:39,670
lockdown.

307
00:13:39,814 --> 00:13:42,421
No one other than my team comes
or goes without my permission,

308
00:13:42,452 --> 00:13:43,229
that includes you.

309
00:13:44,127 --> 00:13:45,884
Don't you think
you're overreacting ?

310
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,909
I'm just getting started.

311
00:13:50,681 --> 00:13:51,653
Beautiful night.

312
00:14:00,895 --> 00:14:02,611
What did I do to deserve this ?

313
00:14:03,371 --> 00:14:06,576
I thought I might welcome you
to some hungarian generosity.

314
00:14:07,459 --> 00:14:08,900
Unless I'm interrupting.

315
00:14:10,496 --> 00:14:12,106
Darlin', it's what you're starting

316
00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:13,698
that I don't want interrupted.

317
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:16,156
You tried monarchia ?

318
00:14:19,836 --> 00:14:21,797
I can't even pronounce it.

319
00:14:27,551 --> 00:14:31,970
If you like it, I have another
bottle back at my place.

320
00:14:37,933 --> 00:14:39,557
Must have been that
trip to the convent.

321
00:14:40,874 --> 00:14:41,597
Thank you.

322
00:14:42,155 --> 00:14:43,735
To the second bottle.

323
00:14:44,278 --> 00:14:46,176
The second bottle.

324
00:14:54,804 --> 00:14:56,050
Hey, aren't you going to...

325
00:14:56,736 --> 00:14:57,087
Huh ?

326
00:15:54,081 --> 00:15:55,286
Good evening, father.

327
00:15:56,348 --> 00:15:57,359
Welcome, father.

328
00:15:58,054 --> 00:15:59,647
I hope all is going well.

329
00:15:59,964 --> 00:16:00,873
We need to talk.

330
00:16:01,373 --> 00:16:02,578
I don't have much time.

331
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,794
It'd take a team of
munitions experts

332
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:25,805
and bulldozers
to pull these burglaries off.

333
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,039
Or six unchipped neuros.

334
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:29,570
Armstrong and phillips,

335
00:16:29,654 --> 00:16:31,245
both claim that
the experimental surgeries

336
00:16:31,387 --> 00:16:33,177
were discontinued before
yielding any results.

337
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,105
You believe them ?

338
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:36,212
At this point, no.

339
00:16:36,533 --> 00:16:37,793
If there are any plans in the works

340
00:16:37,904 --> 00:16:39,883
for an assault on the castle
I'll know about it.

341
00:16:40,524 --> 00:16:42,599
I've linked into what little
there is of their system.

342
00:16:44,568 --> 00:16:46,852
Hey, did you get anything off
those tapes rawlings gave you ?

343
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:47,857
Nothing.

344
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:49,968
You with us, or what connor ?

345
00:16:50,383 --> 00:16:51,532
Just barely.

346
00:16:52,569 --> 00:16:54,883
Trust me, be careful if
you sample the local wine.

347
00:16:55,151 --> 00:16:55,997
What'd I miss ?

348
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:57,904
I thought you might have
something to report

349
00:16:57,998 --> 00:16:59,242
besides the local wine.

350
00:16:59,368 --> 00:17:00,920
Why would I have
something to report ?

351
00:17:01,015 --> 00:17:02,546
I passed out in my room last night.

352
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:03,199
Oh, really ?

353
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,409
This is time-coded just
after 1900 hours.

354
00:17:08,678 --> 00:17:10,625
Right off the cameras
at the main entrance.

355
00:17:12,071 --> 00:17:13,613
I swear, boss, I never left.

356
00:17:17,468 --> 00:17:18,814
That is me, isn't it ?

357
00:17:19,588 --> 00:17:21,168
I checked the odometer on the suv.

358
00:17:21,493 --> 00:17:24,094
Between the time connor
says he didn't drive out

359
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,720
until the time he
didn't get back...

360
00:17:25,846 --> 00:17:27,895
Someone racked up
just over six miles.

361
00:17:31,565 --> 00:17:33,786
Just about enough for
a round trip to the convent.

362
00:17:37,631 --> 00:17:38,881
What about baumgartner ?

363
00:17:39,965 --> 00:17:42,042
The man can shape shift
into pretty much anyone.

364
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,750
He is on the list of escapees.

365
00:17:44,818 --> 00:17:46,678
Why come back to the place
you escaped from ?

366
00:17:46,828 --> 00:17:47,898
Not that big a risk

367
00:17:47,945 --> 00:17:49,370
if you can impersonating
anyone you want.

368
00:17:49,491 --> 00:17:50,483
Come and go as you need.

369
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,379
We keep him high on the list.

370
00:17:52,526 --> 00:17:54,155
At this point, we have
to proceed assuming

371
00:17:54,265 --> 00:17:56,375
that armstrong and phillips
are lying to us.

372
00:17:56,485 --> 00:17:59,348
And if that's the case,
that "maintenance area"

373
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,852
which is supposed to be
of no particular interest

374
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:03,883
could turn out to be
very interesting.

375
00:18:04,032 --> 00:18:05,581
I'd like to run
ultrasonics on the tunnel.

376
00:18:05,725 --> 00:18:06,681
It's still our best bet.

377
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:08,455
Alright, we reconvene in two hours.

378
00:18:08,572 --> 00:18:09,613
I want everyone to carry.

379
00:19:55,786 --> 00:19:56,759
Armstrong ?!

380
00:20:08,613 --> 00:20:10,209
access denied.

381
00:20:26,994 --> 00:20:28,574
I was not in your room last night.

382
00:20:28,909 --> 00:20:31,255
I was in the lab
until my shift ended.

383
00:20:31,329 --> 00:20:33,896
I clocked out at 1800 hours.

384
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,657
You can check
with security to verify.

385
00:20:49,173 --> 00:20:52,652
I never should've turned
down that job at microsoft.

386
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:05,796
retinal imprint, failed.

387
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:11,908
Nice place.

388
00:22:12,442 --> 00:22:13,739
I think I found something.

389
00:22:14,653 --> 00:22:15,453
Check this out.

390
00:22:17,073 --> 00:22:19,013
This is a density
readout on the tunnel.

391
00:22:19,451 --> 00:22:20,811
You can see that the ends are solid

392
00:22:21,094 --> 00:22:21,990
about three feet deep.

393
00:22:22,121 --> 00:22:24,204
Probably concrete like they said.

394
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:26,679
But if you look here,

395
00:22:27,133 --> 00:22:29,341
you can see that except for
this solid area in the center,

396
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,719
once that's cleared,
the tunnel would be passable.

397
00:22:37,033 --> 00:22:38,214
You find your woman ?

398
00:22:38,449 --> 00:22:39,625
We found the woman.

399
00:22:39,938 --> 00:22:41,035
Well, I've got something.

400
00:22:41,482 --> 00:22:42,732
I was just explaing to jane...

401
00:22:42,888 --> 00:22:43,399
Hey !!!!

402
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,096
Move !! over there!! Go !!

403
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,104
Andre.

404
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:06,655
I assume that one of you
is jakob baumgartner.

405
00:23:07,454 --> 00:23:08,824
The only question is,

406
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:09,988
which one ?

407
00:23:16,253 --> 00:23:17,338
There's a way.

408
00:23:17,774 --> 00:23:18,738
Shoot both of us.

409
00:23:18,959 --> 00:23:20,511
It's a win-win situation.

410
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:23,629
She's right, boss.

411
00:23:24,209 --> 00:23:26,326
Our girl'll just get up
like nothing happened.

412
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,642
Last chance, mr. Baumgartner.

413
00:23:55,331 --> 00:23:57,214
You could've shot me in the leg.

414
00:23:59,109 --> 00:23:59,732
Ah !!

415
00:24:03,783 --> 00:24:04,866
Armstrong's dead.

416
00:24:04,948 --> 00:24:05,632
When ?

417
00:24:06,281 --> 00:24:09,321
I'm not an m.E. But given
the condition of his body,

418
00:24:09,809 --> 00:24:11,497
I'd say he was dead
before we arrived.

419
00:24:11,731 --> 00:24:13,042
Baumgartner's been busy.

420
00:24:13,712 --> 00:24:16,848
And that maintenance area
isn't a maintenance area.

421
00:24:17,298 --> 00:24:18,574
I only got as far as the morgue

422
00:24:18,695 --> 00:24:21,795
but there seems to be
another facility beyond that.

423
00:24:22,672 --> 00:24:23,773
I couldn't get through.

424
00:24:24,363 --> 00:24:26,347
Time we had a talk
with dr. Phillips.

425
00:24:26,488 --> 00:24:28,117
If it ever was dr. Phillips.

426
00:24:29,298 --> 00:24:31,037
Riley, call security.

427
00:24:31,715 --> 00:24:33,143
Have them get rid of this body.

428
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:35,611
It's time we find out what
they don't want us to know.

429
00:24:50,646 --> 00:24:51,831
I'm the computer tech.

430
00:24:52,355 --> 00:24:54,610
It's you guys that are supposed
to get hit on the head.

431
00:24:55,404 --> 00:24:57,757
You might want one of
the doctors to check that out.

432
00:24:57,872 --> 00:25:00,339
I think it's baumgartner
who's checked out.

433
00:25:04,325 --> 00:25:06,544
I have a pretty good
idea where "I'm" going.

434
00:25:13,248 --> 00:25:14,756
As I started to explain to jane...

435
00:25:15,734 --> 00:25:17,234
Well, baumgartner...

436
00:25:17,505 --> 00:25:18,287
Whatever.

437
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,620
This concrete is
only a few feet deep.

438
00:25:20,742 --> 00:25:21,743
The same is true at the other end.

439
00:25:21,859 --> 00:25:22,919
And except for a few
feet that're still

440
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:23,993
blocked in the middle,

441
00:25:24,409 --> 00:25:25,835
the ends are like corks.

442
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:27,402
Blow'em out, clear the middle

443
00:25:27,543 --> 00:25:29,154
boom, you have free access.

444
00:25:29,298 --> 00:25:30,750
From the convent and the hospital.

445
00:25:30,969 --> 00:25:33,291
It would explain the stolen
c-4 and other equipment.

446
00:25:33,391 --> 00:25:35,976
If the freaks are planning to
break their friends out of here,

447
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:38,450
then they have to be working
it from the convent side.

448
00:25:38,699 --> 00:25:40,584
You think the mother
superior lied to us ?

449
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:42,004
I'd say if it's mother superior,

450
00:25:42,115 --> 00:25:42,993
she could be an escapee.

451
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,068
No, I don't think so.

452
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:45,850
Why not ?

453
00:25:46,074 --> 00:25:47,717
She doesn't match any
of the profiles.

454
00:25:47,877 --> 00:25:49,105
They could be controlling her.

455
00:25:49,407 --> 00:25:51,194
Baumgartner's not going
to give up the game

456
00:25:51,305 --> 00:25:52,375
and he knows he's under pressure.

457
00:25:52,496 --> 00:25:54,115
If they're going to move,
they will move soon.

458
00:25:54,376 --> 00:25:56,527
What would it take
to force a cave-in

459
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:57,723
and seal the tunnel ?

460
00:25:57,841 --> 00:26:00,020
Same as they're planning
to use to clear the concrete.

461
00:26:00,171 --> 00:26:02,688
A small truckload of c-4
just placed differently.

462
00:26:02,848 --> 00:26:03,486
Can you do it ?

463
00:26:03,832 --> 00:26:07,866
I guess, given the supplies
and chemicals around this place,

464
00:26:08,249 --> 00:26:10,531
mixed in the right
proportions... Maybe.

465
00:26:10,672 --> 00:26:11,263
How long ?

466
00:26:11,454 --> 00:26:13,050
Less time if I get started now.

467
00:26:13,178 --> 00:26:13,672
Good.

468
00:26:13,791 --> 00:26:15,722
Riley, you work this
end with connor.

469
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,096
You and I better get
to the convent.

470
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:18,844
If baumgartner's going to move,

471
00:26:19,115 --> 00:26:21,252
he may not want
to leave any witnesses.

472
00:26:25,388 --> 00:26:27,571
Great, down here again.

473
00:26:59,164 --> 00:27:01,205
Still think she's an innocent ?

474
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:02,518
Tough play to call.

475
00:27:02,836 --> 00:27:04,464
Best bet is to chip both of them.

476
00:27:04,542 --> 00:27:06,648
She might actually
be a mother superior.

477
00:27:08,053 --> 00:27:09,999
If she's not a neuro,
the chip won't hurt her.

478
00:27:11,372 --> 00:27:12,537
It's your afterlife.

479
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:14,268
I'll take baumgartner.

480
00:27:37,751 --> 00:27:38,501
Cuff him.

481
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:41,820
You have no right...

482
00:27:42,113 --> 00:27:43,577
I have every right.

483
00:27:45,443 --> 00:27:48,233
I don't think you realize who
and what we're dealing with here.

484
00:27:48,363 --> 00:27:53,279
You mean a man who's been given
an extraordinary gift from god.

485
00:27:54,661 --> 00:27:57,122
You're attempting
to protect yourself

486
00:27:57,241 --> 00:27:59,435
from things you don't understand.

487
00:27:59,737 --> 00:28:04,173
This man and the others
like him are simply trying

488
00:28:04,285 --> 00:28:08,848
to protect themselves
from imprisonment and butchery,

489
00:28:09,134 --> 00:28:11,129
ignorance and fear.

490
00:28:12,927 --> 00:28:14,683
I think you have been
sold a bill of goods,

491
00:28:14,784 --> 00:28:15,577
mother superior.

492
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:17,996
We only want to understand them.

493
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:20,342
Who they are, why they are.

494
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,441
No one wants to harm them.

495
00:28:23,095 --> 00:28:25,265
You have to expect him to lie,
cover-up the truth.

496
00:28:25,553 --> 00:28:26,478
He's one of them.

497
00:28:27,118 --> 00:28:28,331
What truth is that ?

498
00:28:29,266 --> 00:28:29,856
Ha!

499
00:28:30,526 --> 00:28:31,595
Please, miss vasco.

500
00:28:32,574 --> 00:28:34,516
The de-chipping, the experiments.

501
00:28:35,461 --> 00:28:37,185
Cutting into us as if
we were nothing more

502
00:28:37,271 --> 00:28:38,117
than laboratory rats.

503
00:28:38,596 --> 00:28:40,729
Leaving some of us
crippled and blind,

504
00:28:41,249 --> 00:28:42,605
and those are the lucky ones.

505
00:28:48,225 --> 00:28:50,897
You really don't know, do you ?

506
00:28:58,083 --> 00:29:00,300
Then perhaps it's time
you were introduced

507
00:29:00,423 --> 00:29:01,781
to the dangerous escapees

508
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:03,632
you've been working
so hard to apprehend.

509
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:08,745
Alright.

510
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:19,778
Just how powerful is this stuff ?

511
00:29:20,704 --> 00:29:22,295
It's enough to finish the job.

512
00:29:25,965 --> 00:29:28,071
But not enough to take
the whole place down, right ?

513
00:29:30,253 --> 00:29:30,701
Let's go!

514
00:29:31,121 --> 00:29:32,582
Guess we're gonna find out ?

515
00:29:37,436 --> 00:29:38,489
On my mark.

516
00:29:39,587 --> 00:29:42,409
3, 2, 1.

517
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,498
Your vicious band of
criminals, agent mcbride.

518
00:30:36,527 --> 00:30:39,623
Is dr. Phillips responsible
for all of this ?

519
00:30:39,735 --> 00:30:40,325
Yes.

520
00:30:40,931 --> 00:30:41,970
This is his handiwork.

521
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:44,193
The people we hope
to set free are not

522
00:30:44,337 --> 00:30:45,605
as "fortunate" as these.

523
00:30:46,547 --> 00:30:48,055
And you're their appointed savior.

524
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:49,430
Why ?

525
00:30:49,901 --> 00:30:51,637
Because, agent mcbride,

526
00:30:52,546 --> 00:30:54,267
though it might come
as a shock to you...

527
00:30:54,707 --> 00:30:56,543
I do possess a conscience.

528
00:31:03,108 --> 00:31:07,070
Months of work
and only seconds to destroy it.

529
00:31:07,609 --> 00:31:11,960
This tunnel, it saved
countless lives in the past.

530
00:31:13,094 --> 00:31:16,391
We'd hoped it could serve
that purpose again.

531
00:31:20,235 --> 00:31:22,726
can you really let this continue

532
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:27,740
and allow these people to suffer ?

533
00:31:40,838 --> 00:31:42,224
The ball...

534
00:31:42,756 --> 00:31:44,462
as they say,

535
00:31:44,981 --> 00:31:46,565
is in your court, sir.

536
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:25,867
any one of those
people could have been me.

537
00:32:28,054 --> 00:32:29,649
And, in less enlightened times...

538
00:32:30,636 --> 00:32:31,569
You.

539
00:32:58,561 --> 00:32:59,949
I don't think these
people will give you

540
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:01,274
any further trouble.

541
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:05,230
I'll see that they're
taken to their rooms.

542
00:33:26,288 --> 00:33:28,410
You may have pressed your
luck this time, jakob.

543
00:33:34,213 --> 00:33:35,386
Alright, let's go.

544
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:54,769
It seems as if it's your luck
that has changed, doctor.

545
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,370
You didn't chip them ?!!

546
00:34:00,636 --> 00:34:02,516
You must to stop this!

547
00:34:02,959 --> 00:34:04,427
I thought you were
going to chip them.

548
00:34:04,571 --> 00:34:07,396
No, agent, I distinctly
recall giving you that order.

549
00:34:09,103 --> 00:34:10,889
Well, we seem to have
a real problem on our

550
00:34:11,001 --> 00:34:11,840
hands, don't we ?

551
00:34:12,615 --> 00:34:14,902
You would agree,
wouldn't you, doctor ?

552
00:34:15,895 --> 00:34:17,829
This is something of a problem.

553
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:19,556
What're you doing ?!

554
00:34:20,051 --> 00:34:22,188
Maybe now, you'll be inclined
to tell us the truth !

555
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:26,771
Unless you'd like to wait there
while we retrieve our chip guns.

556
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,558
You know,
I can't seem to find mine.

557
00:34:28,839 --> 00:34:30,100
Do you know what's happened
to yours ?

558
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,556
I'll tell you whatever you want.

559
00:34:32,819 --> 00:34:35,181
Just get them out of here.

560
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:41,114
No, doctor, I think it best
that they stayed and listened,

561
00:34:41,368 --> 00:34:45,709
after all, who'd better to
call you on your lies than them.

562
00:35:59,821 --> 00:36:01,440
I should have let them kill you.

563
00:36:01,603 --> 00:36:02,855
Are your hands so clean ?

564
00:36:02,983 --> 00:36:06,029
This is your work,
doctor, not mine.

565
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,244
If I had known...

566
00:36:07,344 --> 00:36:08,876
If you had known, what ?

567
00:36:10,504 --> 00:36:13,370
Single-handedly you would
have put a stop to it ?

568
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:18,333
What did you people
think was happening here?

569
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:19,632
Not this.

570
00:36:20,877 --> 00:36:25,424
How nice to be able
to choose to be so blind.

571
00:36:26,431 --> 00:36:29,607
You loathe me for doing
your housekeeping.

572
00:36:30,717 --> 00:36:32,799
It's always nice to have
clean toilets,

573
00:36:33,577 --> 00:36:36,673
just don't inquire as to how
the job was accomplished.

574
00:36:36,858 --> 00:36:39,220
That's a bit simplistic,
don't you think, doctor ?

575
00:36:39,507 --> 00:36:40,289
Is it?

576
00:36:41,661 --> 00:36:44,119
Ever since the first
aberration surfaced,

577
00:36:44,247 --> 00:36:46,978
we've been under orders and
pressure to find the source,

578
00:36:47,105 --> 00:36:50,456
understand the nature
of the mutation.

579
00:36:51,739 --> 00:36:55,563
You, as well as anyone, should
understand, agent mcbride,

580
00:36:55,892 --> 00:36:59,193
they want results, not excuses.

581
00:36:59,646 --> 00:37:00,620
At any cost ?

582
00:37:00,811 --> 00:37:02,004
Don't be naive !!!

583
00:37:06,313 --> 00:37:09,920
Had I come up with the answers,
discovered a cure,

584
00:37:10,879 --> 00:37:12,407
I'd have been given
a medal of honor

585
00:37:12,586 --> 00:37:14,465
and a parade to go along with it.

586
00:37:16,896 --> 00:37:20,282
Are you even vaguely aware
of what's gone into medical

587
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,847
research over the years ?

588
00:37:22,852 --> 00:37:25,270
Research, that in the end,
has saved millions of lives.

589
00:37:25,393 --> 00:37:26,453
And that makes it okay !!

590
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:28,425
It makes it necessary!!

591
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:33,101
As much as you don't want
to know, miss vasco,

592
00:37:33,487 --> 00:37:35,194
you are part of this.

593
00:37:35,338 --> 00:37:37,668
We work on the same team,
toward the same end.

594
00:37:37,827 --> 00:37:40,534
No, no, not anymore we don't !

595
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,422
That team is about
to change, doctor.

596
00:37:43,707 --> 00:37:46,460
In fact, my team will stay here
until this entire facility

597
00:37:46,575 --> 00:37:48,124
is either cleaned up
or cleaned out.

598
00:37:48,445 --> 00:37:50,583
You will give me full access
to your records.

599
00:37:50,889 --> 00:37:53,728
I want the name of
every individual involved.

600
00:37:55,096 --> 00:37:57,738
Are there any physicians on
this staff that can be trusted ?

601
00:37:58,333 --> 00:37:59,534
Dr. Newman.

602
00:38:01,217 --> 00:38:03,039
I'll have him form a new team.

603
00:38:04,877 --> 00:38:07,068
Hopefully, it's not too late
to help some of these people.

604
00:38:08,271 --> 00:38:09,423
Let's get out of here.

605
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:10,825
Agent mcbride.

606
00:38:14,028 --> 00:38:15,321
I misjudged you.

607
00:38:23,542 --> 00:38:24,356
Thank you.

608
00:39:02,531 --> 00:39:04,387
Dr. Newman is attending
to the crew.

609
00:39:05,518 --> 00:39:07,033
Some of them may survive.

610
00:39:08,235 --> 00:39:09,113
Phillips was right.

611
00:39:10,661 --> 00:39:11,905
My hands aren't so clean.

612
00:39:14,696 --> 00:39:16,116
We all live to learn, jane.

613
00:39:17,345 --> 00:39:21,174
It's learning that we can
wash our hands that matters.

614
00:39:22,329 --> 00:39:23,233
Compassion ?

615
00:39:24,026 --> 00:39:27,409
When we last met,
I was rather ill-behaved.

616
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,394
But things have changed.

617
00:39:30,161 --> 00:39:30,747
Have they ?

618
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,035
Haven't you always
suspected that in the end

619
00:39:34,125 --> 00:39:35,495
we are more alike than different ?

620
00:39:36,117 --> 00:39:37,633
I'm not too sure of that.

621
00:39:39,148 --> 00:39:41,254
Clearly, you're not
the only one of us

622
00:39:41,376 --> 00:39:43,684
who can survive a gunshot
to the chest.

623
00:39:46,292 --> 00:39:47,201
We're family.

624
00:39:48,047 --> 00:39:49,499
You've known it for some time.

625
00:39:53,173 --> 00:39:54,701
I suppose I have.

626
00:39:55,829 --> 00:39:57,470
I've spoken with dr. Roberts.

627
00:39:58,548 --> 00:40:01,484
And I know you two finally
had the chance to meet.

628
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:05,707
He and randall hyde, you and I,

629
00:40:05,835 --> 00:40:07,401
it appears we have a great
deal in common.

630
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:10,667
You said that you weren't
part of phillips' experiments.

631
00:40:11,385 --> 00:40:12,566
You were never de-chipped ?

632
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:13,220
No.

633
00:40:14,752 --> 00:40:16,731
Maureen chipped you
when she apprehended you.

634
00:40:17,736 --> 00:40:20,257
How are you able to continue
to use your abilities ?

635
00:40:21,566 --> 00:40:24,662
When dr. Roberts told you that
he'd perfected his process,

636
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:26,050
he was telling the truth.

637
00:40:27,311 --> 00:40:30,023
Chipping has no effect on us,
any of us.

638
00:40:32,225 --> 00:40:33,502
The people you sent to nico,

639
00:40:33,694 --> 00:40:35,669
are the result
of earlier experiments.

640
00:40:38,398 --> 00:40:39,818
But you still wanted to help them.

641
00:40:41,265 --> 00:40:42,031
As did you.

642
00:40:47,026 --> 00:40:49,299
Perhaps there's more
to dr. Robert's vision

643
00:40:49,427 --> 00:40:53,580
of an improved species than
simply the ability to heal.

644
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:58,306
What happens now ?

645
00:40:58,561 --> 00:40:59,934
You'll learn that soon enough.

646
00:41:19,387 --> 00:41:20,631
There's an old phrase...

647
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,393
Be careful what you wish for,

648
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:23,780
you just might get it.

649
00:41:24,658 --> 00:41:27,052
The people I work for have
been desperate to understand

650
00:41:27,179 --> 00:41:28,192
the neuro phenomenon...

651
00:41:28,955 --> 00:41:31,077
How it works, where it started.

652
00:41:31,939 --> 00:41:33,790
In time, they may get that answer.

653
00:41:34,802 --> 00:41:36,254
But at what price ?

654
00:41:39,478 --> 00:41:40,786
And ever since I can remember,

655
00:41:41,326 --> 00:41:43,891
I've always wished to feel
part of something.

656
00:41:44,884 --> 00:41:47,964
Now it seems, after
all these years, that I am.

657
00:41:49,871 --> 00:41:51,074
The price for that, too,

658
00:41:52,391 --> 00:41:55,159
might be more than
I'm willing to consider.

659
00:41:57,478 --> 00:41:58,826
Beautiful night.

660
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:03,984
It might turn out to be.

661
00:42:05,333 --> 00:42:08,218
I feel I owe you an apology.

662
00:42:09,442 --> 00:42:10,384
I don't know why.

663
00:42:10,512 --> 00:42:12,331
According to everyone the "you"

664
00:42:12,474 --> 00:42:15,091
that came to my room wasn't you.

665
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:19,120
Then perhaps you'd like
to share some wine

666
00:42:19,247 --> 00:42:20,683
with the real me.

667
00:42:22,423 --> 00:42:23,380
Not monarchia ?

668
00:42:23,747 --> 00:42:24,928
Definitely not.

669
00:42:26,271 --> 00:42:29,922
I'll guarantee you'll like
what I have for you much more.

670
00:42:40,077 --> 00:42:41,958
Y'know, if you are baumgartner,

671
00:42:43,623 --> 00:42:44,849
this could get strange.

672
00:42:46,057 --> 00:42:48,522
You have nothing to worry about.

673
00:42:53,632 --> 00:42:56,137
Do you really think
you'll need that ?

674
00:42:56,208 --> 00:42:58,443
I'm a firm believer in safe sex.

675
