1
00:00:00,801 --> 00:00:02,207
My name is jane vasco.

2
00:00:02,309 --> 00:00:03,592
I could use
you on my team.

3
00:00:03,675 --> 00:00:06,728
I work for a secret government
agency that hunts neuros.

4
00:00:06,815 --> 00:00:10,154
People who can do dangerous
things with their minds.

5
00:00:11,801 --> 00:00:13,051
On my first assignment...

6
00:00:13,242 --> 00:00:14,942
Something a little
weird happened,

7
00:00:15,491 --> 00:00:16,941
okay, something
really weird.

8
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,340
Until i get some answers
i'm getting on with my life,
doing my job.

9
00:00:23,741 --> 00:00:28,566
Stocking up on aspirin,
because let me tell ya,

10
00:00:29,052 --> 00:00:30,052
pain's a bitch!

11
00:00:31,047 --> 00:00:32,248
The five car pile up...

12
00:01:23,365 --> 00:01:24,047
alright, check your comms.

13
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:25,238
Maureen?

14
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:25,666
Check.

15
00:01:25,781 --> 00:01:26,371
Connor?

16
00:01:26,463 --> 00:01:27,088
Check.

17
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:30,680
Alright, now watch
your footing,

18
00:01:30,681 --> 00:01:32,481
we know he has mines
and trip wires.

19
00:01:32,491 --> 00:01:34,141
Maybe some home-made
goodies too.

20
00:01:34,179 --> 00:01:35,179
Probably.

21
00:01:35,932 --> 00:01:37,382
Alright, take first
positions

22
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,470
you don't move until
i give the word.

23
00:01:40,494 --> 00:01:41,306
Understood?

24
00:01:41,307 --> 00:01:41,804
Copy.

25
00:01:41,805 --> 00:01:42,805
Copy.

26
00:01:42,932 --> 00:01:43,932
All right, move out.

27
00:02:06,433 --> 00:02:07,783
Maureen,
into position now!

28
00:02:08,942 --> 00:02:09,890
Incoming!!

29
00:02:11,093 --> 00:02:12,214
Bauers, are you hit?

30
00:02:12,307 --> 00:02:15,370
No, but i don't think this
stealth approach is working.

31
00:02:15,475 --> 00:02:17,255
Connor, you in position?

32
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,556
Connor, connor...

33
00:02:22,306 --> 00:02:23,306
Connor!!!

34
00:02:23,307 --> 00:02:24,307
He's hit!!

35
00:02:24,871 --> 00:02:27,371
Bauer, why don't you lay
down some fire,
on three.

36
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,620
Alright, 1...

37
00:02:29,244 --> 00:02:30,244
2...

38
00:02:31,308 --> 00:02:32,308
3!!

39
00:03:39,808 --> 00:03:40,808
so here we are.

40
00:03:41,747 --> 00:03:42,747
Yeah.

41
00:03:43,935 --> 00:03:44,935
Here we are.

42
00:03:51,823 --> 00:03:56,494
Transcript : swsub.com
Pre-synchro : IceFre@k

43
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:03,625
We spend our lives
looking for answers.

44
00:04:04,048 --> 00:04:05,048
Who am i?

45
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:06,299
Why am i here?

46
00:04:06,674 --> 00:04:08,774
Why is david hasselhoff
so big in germany?

47
00:04:10,485 --> 00:04:12,485
We always think that finding
the answers

48
00:04:12,923 --> 00:04:15,323
are going to bring us some
kind of satisfaction,

49
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:18,123
when usually it
just gets us more questions.

50
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:21,051
The more things i find
out about myself,

51
00:04:21,676 --> 00:04:24,076
the more i wish i could
develop partial amnesia.

52
00:04:24,487 --> 00:04:27,737
Only with my luck,
i probably rember the pain
and forget my name.

53
00:04:30,239 --> 00:04:32,689
Hey, i did a story on your
old boss at the d.e.a.

54
00:04:32,925 --> 00:04:33,861
Earl pike.

55
00:04:33,862 --> 00:04:34,862
Yeah?

56
00:04:35,049 --> 00:04:36,899
Seems as if he took
early retirement.

57
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,675
You're kidding!

58
00:04:38,676 --> 00:04:39,826
Lt. Pike loved the job.

59
00:04:41,988 --> 00:04:43,038
Up until he got shot.

60
00:04:44,303 --> 00:04:45,903
I interviewed him
for the story.

61
00:04:45,924 --> 00:04:47,926
Seems the shooting
really threw the fear of
god into him.

62
00:04:47,927 --> 00:04:49,177
Yeah, but enough
to quit?

63
00:04:51,678 --> 00:04:54,128
The man took a bullet
a half inch from his heart.

64
00:04:54,702 --> 00:04:56,344
I guess it's hard to say
what any of us would do

65
00:04:56,402 --> 00:04:58,019
unless we've walked
in his shoes.

66
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:02,921
Brian and i have
been going out

67
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:08,840
just long enough for it
to still be exciting and scary
at the same time.

68
00:05:09,801 --> 00:05:15,601
So much to learn about him
and so much to keep him
from discovering about me.

69
00:05:24,804 --> 00:05:25,804
Come on!

70
00:05:36,676 --> 00:05:37,676
Number b-4.

71
00:05:38,489 --> 00:05:39,489
Bingo!

72
00:05:39,615 --> 00:05:40,303
Bingo!

73
00:05:40,304 --> 00:05:41,304
Bingo!

74
00:05:44,116 --> 00:05:44,927
Oh... Hello!

75
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:45,928
Sorry to interrupt.

76
00:05:46,802 --> 00:05:47,802
It started raing...

77
00:05:47,927 --> 00:05:48,977
It's quite all right.

78
00:05:49,489 --> 00:05:50,789
Would you like to join us?

79
00:05:51,554 --> 00:05:52,604
We have reservations.

80
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:53,675
Yeah, uh-huh.

81
00:05:53,676 --> 00:05:54,676
Aw, that's too bad.

82
00:05:55,552 --> 00:05:58,202
I'm going to find
the ladies' room,
dry off a little.

83
00:05:58,929 --> 00:06:01,529
And tell your paper that
they need a new weatherman.

84
00:06:02,741 --> 00:06:03,741
Number o-69.

85
00:07:05,055 --> 00:07:06,107
Everything okay?

86
00:07:06,108 --> 00:07:07,067
I have to go.

87
00:07:07,171 --> 00:07:08,368
We haven't even had..

88
00:07:08,369 --> 00:07:09,369
I'm so sorry.

89
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,305
I can't really
explain, but...

90
00:07:13,176 --> 00:07:14,430
Duty calls.

91
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,731
Yeah, something like that.

92
00:07:16,681 --> 00:07:18,331
I promise i'll
make it up to you.

93
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,255
That, i'm looking
forward to.

94
00:07:39,682 --> 00:07:40,682
Hey.

95
00:07:41,181 --> 00:07:44,131
Hey, i'm sorry to drag you
out, but i need you to see this.

96
00:07:46,493 --> 00:07:47,493
Agent vasco.

97
00:07:47,994 --> 00:07:51,494
I'm not even sure
who you are an agent with,
but i know in three days,

98
00:07:52,496 --> 00:07:54,496
you and your team
will try to arrest me.

99
00:07:55,496 --> 00:07:56,496
It won't go well.

100
00:07:57,496 --> 00:07:59,120
Your three teammates
will be killed.

101
00:07:59,121 --> 00:08:00,371
And then you'll shoot me.

102
00:08:00,682 --> 00:08:02,382
I die in front of
the orange door.

103
00:08:03,432 --> 00:08:04,732
Is this some
kind of joke?

104
00:08:05,243 --> 00:08:06,243
Keep watching.

105
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,670
I know how this sounds,
but you have to believe me.

106
00:08:11,931 --> 00:08:13,931
These things that
i see all will happen.

107
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,680
I can't stop it,
but maybe you can.

108
00:08:19,184 --> 00:08:20,534
Please don't
come after me.

109
00:08:21,184 --> 00:08:22,184
Keep your team away.

110
00:08:23,933 --> 00:08:26,283
It's the only way
to save their lives and mine.

111
00:08:27,184 --> 00:08:28,634
You found this
in a bathroom?

112
00:08:28,994 --> 00:08:31,044
It was taped to a mirror,
waiting for me.

113
00:08:32,121 --> 00:08:33,620
Who knew where
you'd be tonight?

114
00:08:33,621 --> 00:08:34,621
Nobody.

115
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:35,682
That's the thing.

116
00:08:36,184 --> 00:08:37,930
Brian and i were on
our way to dinner.

117
00:08:37,931 --> 00:08:39,931
When all of a sudden
it started raining,

118
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,760
so we ran into that
senior center.

119
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,805
Are you sure he didn't steer
you that way intentionally?

120
00:08:43,806 --> 00:08:45,055
In case it started raing.

121
00:08:45,056 --> 00:08:46,406
At exactly the right moment

122
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,820
to fit into his master plan
to freak me out?

123
00:08:49,434 --> 00:08:50,434
I don't think so.

124
00:08:52,934 --> 00:08:54,434
What do you think
i should do?

125
00:08:54,748 --> 00:08:56,309
Jane, we don't know
who this guys is.

126
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,660
He's not even
on our radar.

127
00:08:58,498 --> 00:09:01,448
Maybe it will turn out to be
a practical joke or something.

128
00:09:02,999 --> 00:09:04,249
See ya tomorrow,
alright?

129
00:09:16,935 --> 00:09:18,285
Hey, it could be
a new one.

130
00:09:19,621 --> 00:09:20,810
How many incidents, riley?

131
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:22,058
Four, including this one.

132
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:22,872
What's going on?

133
00:09:22,873 --> 00:09:25,559
Riley's been tracking a series
of unusual phone calls.

134
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,560
It could be neuro.

135
00:09:27,373 --> 00:09:30,183
You remember that plane crash
yesterday in north carolina?

136
00:09:30,184 --> 00:09:32,057
Somebody called the airline
that morning,

137
00:09:32,058 --> 00:09:33,758
warning them to cancel
the flight.

138
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,460
The cops figured
that the tipster

139
00:09:35,562 --> 00:09:36,620
must have had some kind
of involvement, right?

140
00:09:36,621 --> 00:09:37,748
So they traced the call

141
00:09:37,749 --> 00:09:38,935
and brought the guy in
for questioning...

142
00:09:38,936 --> 00:09:40,836
Same guy's phoned
in three other tips.

143
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:42,557
All solid.

144
00:09:42,558 --> 00:09:43,558
All reliable.

145
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,500
That's the guy.

146
00:09:49,507 --> 00:09:50,663
Damn!

147
00:09:54,748 --> 00:09:55,848
Not on our radar, huh?

148
00:09:57,749 --> 00:09:58,749
What?

149
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:01,599
I have something
you should see.

150
00:10:02,374 --> 00:10:03,874
I got a message
from this man.

151
00:10:04,499 --> 00:10:05,499
Keep your team away.

152
00:10:07,186 --> 00:10:09,536
It's the only way
to save their lives and mine.

153
00:10:10,311 --> 00:10:11,561
"the man" is
ethan grant.

154
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,925
No criminal record,
no nothing.

155
00:10:14,062 --> 00:10:17,247
He told the police that
he "saw" the plane crash
before it happened.

156
00:10:17,248 --> 00:10:19,060
There was no other
evidence connecting him to it.

157
00:10:19,061 --> 00:10:19,933
But there were other
calls, right?

158
00:10:19,934 --> 00:10:21,499
The voice print from
his call to the airline

159
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,499
matches three others from
the past six months,

160
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,749
warning people about bad
things that were going
to happen:

161
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,800
a gas main explosion,

162
00:10:27,123 --> 00:10:28,687
a fire at an elementary school,
and get this...

163
00:10:28,688 --> 00:10:31,138
A tornado that touched
down near amarillo, texas.

164
00:10:32,311 --> 00:10:33,761
Sounds good for
a chip to me.

165
00:10:35,499 --> 00:10:36,899
You heard what
the man said.

166
00:10:37,251 --> 00:10:38,251
If he's right

167
00:10:38,685 --> 00:10:41,585
and so far you say
he has been
then three of you will die.

168
00:10:44,366 --> 00:10:47,237
If you actually believe
that someone can see
into the future.

169
00:10:47,238 --> 00:10:48,114
Even if i don't...

170
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:49,115
Why risk it?

171
00:10:49,426 --> 00:10:50,926
He hasn't committed
any crime.

172
00:10:51,177 --> 00:10:53,113
All he's been doing is
trying to save people's lives.

173
00:10:53,114 --> 00:10:54,114
So far, yes.

174
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,866
But if he is a neuro and
if he can see into the future,

175
00:10:56,867 --> 00:10:58,366
you have to wonder
what else he can do.

176
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:02,178
Bet on every horse race,
title fight and bowl game
for the next twenty years?

177
00:11:02,179 --> 00:11:04,050
I was thinking more along
the lines of predicting

178
00:11:04,051 --> 00:11:05,501
presidential security routes.

179
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:08,365
Or transport protocols
for nuclear weapons.

180
00:11:08,366 --> 00:11:09,615
Why do you assume he's
trying to hurt anyone?

181
00:11:09,616 --> 00:11:10,616
Because he can,

182
00:11:11,614 --> 00:11:13,864
traditional law enforcement
can't handle him.

183
00:11:14,176 --> 00:11:17,426
That power is what makes
him, and every other neuro,
our problem.

184
00:11:17,628 --> 00:11:18,879
Even if it costs
us our lives.

185
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,380
Let's leave this
alone, andre.

186
00:11:20,942 --> 00:11:22,257
Is he still in
police custody?

187
00:11:22,258 --> 00:11:23,258
No.

188
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,830
They had to release him.

189
00:11:25,069 --> 00:11:26,069
Way to go feds.

190
00:11:28,006 --> 00:11:30,206
That's the address where
they picked him up.

191
00:11:30,506 --> 00:11:32,256
A house owned by
his sister, sarah.

192
00:11:33,191 --> 00:11:34,630
If you're going
to do this,
i'm going with you.

193
00:11:34,631 --> 00:11:35,631
Why?

194
00:11:35,942 --> 00:11:38,292
Because i'm the only one
guaranteed to survive.

195
00:11:58,256 --> 00:11:59,068
He's not here.

196
00:11:59,069 --> 00:12:00,469
When do you expect
him home?

197
00:12:00,882 --> 00:12:02,082
Ethan doesn't live here.

198
00:12:02,195 --> 00:12:03,506
He was just visiting
for a few days

199
00:12:03,507 --> 00:12:04,957
when he made that
phone call.

200
00:12:05,318 --> 00:12:08,118
After the police
dragged him off,
i doubt he'll be back.

201
00:12:09,007 --> 00:12:10,319
Do you know where
we can find him?

202
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,131
I don't know.

203
00:12:11,132 --> 00:12:12,318
You don't know where
your own brother lives?

204
00:12:12,319 --> 00:12:13,419
I need to get to work.

205
00:12:13,569 --> 00:12:14,319
We know what he can do.

206
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,120
We know he was trying
to save those people
on the plane.

207
00:12:19,568 --> 00:12:20,868
They wouldn't
believe him.

208
00:12:21,695 --> 00:12:22,695
They never do.

209
00:12:24,131 --> 00:12:25,531
It started about
a year ago.

210
00:12:26,132 --> 00:12:28,082
Before that ethan
seemed fairly normal.

211
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:30,509
Fairly normal?

212
00:12:32,072 --> 00:12:33,722
He worked as
a graphics designer.

213
00:12:34,068 --> 00:12:35,468
He made a good
living at it.

214
00:12:36,383 --> 00:12:37,733
But then something changed.

215
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:42,508
Ethan would get a feeling
that something bad
was going to happen,

216
00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:45,209
and within a few days,
something always did.

217
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:47,933
Then his feelings
got more specific.

218
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,320
He knew when and where...

219
00:12:53,193 --> 00:12:54,693
And how many
people would die.

220
00:12:56,132 --> 00:12:59,932
He called the gas company
in denver to warned them
about the main exploding.

221
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:02,021
They told him someone
would look at it.

222
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,520
Obviously, nobody did,
not until it was too late.

223
00:13:08,072 --> 00:13:09,472
It was like
that every time.

224
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,010
Nobody would listen.

225
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:13,321
We really need to talk
to your brother,

226
00:13:13,322 --> 00:13:14,572
i'm going to ask you
one more time,

227
00:13:14,573 --> 00:13:16,273
do you know where
we can find him?

228
00:13:16,322 --> 00:13:17,322
I wish i did.

229
00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:19,259
Since this began,

230
00:13:19,822 --> 00:13:22,072
ethan has basically
retreated from the world.

231
00:13:23,257 --> 00:13:24,632
When his premonitions
first started,

232
00:13:24,633 --> 00:13:26,433
he thought that they
were the result

233
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:28,423
of some secret
government experiment.

234
00:13:31,135 --> 00:13:33,185
Now he's afraid they want
to dissect him,

235
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,920
or try to exploit
his abilities.

236
00:13:37,386 --> 00:13:39,686
He probably wouldn't like
me talking to you...

237
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,760
Miss grant, we're here
because your brother
sent me a message.

238
00:13:42,761 --> 00:13:43,697
About what?

239
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:44,698
Another disaster.

240
00:13:45,947 --> 00:13:47,847
One that he wants
me to help him stop.

241
00:13:48,821 --> 00:13:51,271
Did he tell you how many
people are going to die?

242
00:13:53,695 --> 00:13:55,245
Did he say he'd
be one of them?

243
00:13:55,947 --> 00:13:56,947
Why do you ask?

244
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:01,409
Because when he came
to see me this week...

245
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:04,133
I got the feeling he was
here to say goodbye.

246
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:10,759
Hello?

247
00:14:11,571 --> 00:14:12,571
Ethan.

248
00:14:13,321 --> 00:14:14,321
Keep him on.

249
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,008
Riley, you got that?

250
00:14:17,009 --> 00:14:17,884
I need a trace.

251
00:14:17,885 --> 00:14:18,885
Got it.

252
00:14:20,824 --> 00:14:23,072
He says to tell the two agents
sitting in my living room

253
00:14:23,073 --> 00:14:25,323
that there's going to
be a terrible accident.

254
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,348
A transformer at
the westdale power station

255
00:14:29,071 --> 00:14:30,871
is going to explode
within the hour.

256
00:14:31,258 --> 00:14:32,760
Five city blocks
will be affected,

257
00:14:32,761 --> 00:14:35,211
including the intersection
of fourth and delancy.

258
00:14:37,385 --> 00:14:39,885
A traffic signal will lose
power and when it does,

259
00:14:40,885 --> 00:14:43,823
it will cause a major accident
involving half a dozen cars.

260
00:14:43,824 --> 00:14:44,974
Eleven people will die.

261
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:46,447
Has he called
the power station?

262
00:14:46,448 --> 00:14:48,321
He's saying that they aren't
going to listen to him.

263
00:14:48,322 --> 00:14:49,698
Maybe they'll
listen to you.

264
00:14:49,699 --> 00:14:50,699
Let me talk to him.

265
00:14:51,073 --> 00:14:51,823
Ethan...

266
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:52,824
Go.

267
00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:57,759
We can be at the power
station in 15 minutes.

268
00:14:57,822 --> 00:14:58,822
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

269
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,698
If he knows we're
on his trail.

270
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:02,549
This could be a ploy
to throw us off.

271
00:15:02,825 --> 00:15:04,425
You willing to
take that chance?

272
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:08,167
Yeah, i know.

273
00:15:08,168 --> 00:15:09,568
If you can't do it,
who can?

274
00:15:10,169 --> 00:15:12,019
Then let me speak
to your supervisor!

275
00:15:12,042 --> 00:15:13,042
Thank you.

276
00:15:14,417 --> 00:15:16,415
Riley says it'd take him
at least an hour to get

277
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,793
into the power plant
control system.

278
00:15:17,794 --> 00:15:20,482
It might take me that long
to get through to these people.

279
00:15:20,483 --> 00:15:21,483
Yes, yes.

280
00:15:21,982 --> 00:15:24,132
My name is jane vasco,
i'm a federal agent.

281
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,120
We just received a tip
that there's a threat

282
00:15:27,604 --> 00:15:29,304
to one of your
power transformers.

283
00:15:30,107 --> 00:15:32,607
It's imperative that you
look into it immediately.

284
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:36,470
No, no, no,
i'm sorry sir,
thsoe details are classified!

285
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:40,706
Sir, i am instructing
you to do this.

286
00:15:42,293 --> 00:15:44,393
If any causalities occur
from your failure

287
00:15:44,482 --> 00:15:45,982
to look into
this situation...

288
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:50,919
What?

289
00:16:56,135 --> 00:16:57,135
Excuse me, hi.

290
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:01,384
Riley traced the call
ethan made to his sister
this morning.

291
00:17:02,008 --> 00:17:04,321
Isn't this enough proof
that the man's for real?

292
00:17:04,322 --> 00:17:06,772
He said if we go after
him, three of us will die.

293
00:17:06,948 --> 00:17:08,448
Or should i say,
three of you.

294
00:17:08,636 --> 00:17:10,386
You have to let
this one go, andre.

295
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:12,097
Can't do it, jane,
you know that.

296
00:17:12,509 --> 00:17:14,559
He goes through what we
just went through

297
00:17:14,697 --> 00:17:16,547
every time he sees
a disaster coming?

298
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,321
Now you want to act like
the government thugs

299
00:17:18,322 --> 00:17:19,972
he's afraid of
and hunt him down?

300
00:17:20,198 --> 00:17:22,148
That is just it,
maybe we can help him?

301
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,759
So far we're
doing a bang-up job.

302
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,960
I mean with his visions.

303
00:17:26,008 --> 00:17:27,258
If he is a neuro,
we can chip him.

304
00:17:27,259 --> 00:17:28,134
Give him some peace.

305
00:17:28,135 --> 00:17:30,259
Unless you want
him to deal with this
for the rest of his life.

306
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,574
No, you think ethan
is some ticking bomb
who needs to be defused.

307
00:17:32,575 --> 00:17:34,225
You don't care
about helping him.

308
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:35,387
You do.

309
00:17:38,446 --> 00:17:41,046
You're a manipulative son
of a bitch, you know that?

310
00:17:41,072 --> 00:17:43,071
Ethan called from
a military surplus store

311
00:17:43,072 --> 00:17:44,872
about a mile away
from his sister's.

312
00:17:47,575 --> 00:17:49,375
Connor and maureen
going to meet us?

313
00:17:49,512 --> 00:17:51,698
You sure this place doesn't
have an orange door?

314
00:17:51,699 --> 00:17:54,099
Look at the bright
side, kid,
it's not saturday.

315
00:17:57,636 --> 00:17:59,186
Yeah, he was here
this morning.

316
00:17:59,573 --> 00:18:00,572
Asked to use the phone.

317
00:18:00,573 --> 00:18:01,923
How many calls
did he make?

318
00:18:01,949 --> 00:18:02,760
Just the one.

319
00:18:02,761 --> 00:18:03,696
A local number.

320
00:18:03,697 --> 00:18:05,510
I don't allow any long
distance on my phone.

321
00:18:05,511 --> 00:18:06,823
Had you ever
seen him before?

322
00:18:06,824 --> 00:18:07,384
Sam?

323
00:18:07,385 --> 00:18:08,134
Sure.

324
00:18:08,135 --> 00:18:09,073
He comes in
once in a while.

325
00:18:09,074 --> 00:18:10,074
Sam?

326
00:18:10,385 --> 00:18:11,585
He said
his name is sam?

327
00:18:11,886 --> 00:18:12,886
Isn't it?

328
00:18:13,197 --> 00:18:14,197
What does he buy?

329
00:18:14,199 --> 00:18:15,134
The basics.

330
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,435
Batteries, rope, water
purification tablets...

331
00:18:19,076 --> 00:18:20,076
Survival gear.

332
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,550
Well, i don't sell
mochaccino lattes.

333
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,200
Obviously not.

334
00:18:28,135 --> 00:18:29,335
You ever sell sam a gun?

335
00:18:29,949 --> 00:18:30,634
Sure.

336
00:18:30,635 --> 00:18:31,385
A hunting rifle.

337
00:18:31,386 --> 00:18:32,386
Anything else?

338
00:18:32,951 --> 00:18:33,951
Couple knives.

339
00:18:34,138 --> 00:18:35,338
Like i said,
the basics.

340
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,900
Hand grenades
and semi-automatics.

341
00:18:44,701 --> 00:18:45,701
Well, well..

342
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,200
Now what?

343
00:18:48,387 --> 00:18:49,134
Close the shop?

344
00:18:49,135 --> 00:18:50,135
Bust me?

345
00:18:50,136 --> 00:18:51,450
I could skip
that last part,

346
00:18:51,451 --> 00:18:52,901
if you give
me sam's address.

347
00:19:03,888 --> 00:19:04,824
Here.

348
00:19:04,825 --> 00:19:05,762
Sam whittaker.

349
00:19:05,763 --> 00:19:06,813
403 morningside lane.

350
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:08,850
That's his
sister's address.

351
00:19:10,325 --> 00:19:11,475
That's what he gave me.

352
00:19:11,513 --> 00:19:12,963
We still have
a deal or what?

353
00:19:13,326 --> 00:19:14,326
What's this?

354
00:19:15,511 --> 00:19:16,511
Dunno.

355
00:19:17,076 --> 00:19:18,076
You know what it is?

356
00:19:18,515 --> 00:19:20,415
These symbols
scribbled in the margin?

357
00:19:20,639 --> 00:19:22,439
It seems familiar,
but i'm not sure.

358
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:26,864
You got anything else?

359
00:19:27,638 --> 00:19:29,138
In my business,
you don't pry.

360
00:19:30,575 --> 00:19:31,827
Especially not
with that one.

361
00:19:31,828 --> 00:19:32,828
Meaning?

362
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:36,589
Your buddy sam has been
stocking up on enough guns,
ammo, trip wires,

363
00:19:36,638 --> 00:19:39,088
mines and grenades to
supply his own little army.

364
00:19:42,075 --> 00:19:43,925
Still think he doesn't
pose a threat?

365
00:19:51,204 --> 00:19:52,265
There's nothing
on this guy.

366
00:19:52,266 --> 00:19:55,116
No bank records, no phone
service, no driver's license...

367
00:19:55,207 --> 00:19:57,265
Same thing for the fake
sam whittaker id.

368
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,544
He knows how to stay
off the radar.

369
00:19:59,834 --> 00:20:02,258
But everybody
makes a slip
and i'll find it.

370
00:20:02,304 --> 00:20:04,582
A paranoid neuro with an
alias and a gun fetish.

371
00:20:04,697 --> 00:20:05,749
Tasty.

372
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:07,761
He drew this?

373
00:20:07,819 --> 00:20:09,692
Yeah, jane thought
it seemed familiar.

374
00:20:09,853 --> 00:20:11,560
Yeah,
it's the tosrona logo.

375
00:20:12,582 --> 00:20:14,168
They made those
funky clear sneakers

376
00:20:14,237 --> 00:20:15,740
that were trendy
a while back.

377
00:20:15,821 --> 00:20:16,787
I had three pairs.

378
00:20:17,226 --> 00:20:19,476
Okay, so we know our
neuro likes geeky shoes.

379
00:20:20,849 --> 00:20:22,999
Okay, guys, tosrona had
a factory downtown.

380
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,360
Closed about a year ago.

381
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,160
This!

382
00:20:26,598 --> 00:20:27,598
This is tosrona.

383
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,660
It's still empty.

384
00:20:30,787 --> 00:20:32,849
The whole district is
pretty much abandoned.

385
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,412
A hell of a place
to live under the radar.

386
00:20:34,413 --> 00:20:35,535
We should check it out.

387
00:20:35,536 --> 00:20:36,660
Told you everybody
makes a slip.

388
00:20:36,661 --> 00:20:37,537
If it is a slip.

389
00:20:37,538 --> 00:20:38,538
That's a good point.

390
00:20:39,784 --> 00:20:41,223
He would have known
we were going to trace him.

391
00:20:41,224 --> 00:20:42,535
Maybe he wanted
us to find this.

392
00:20:42,536 --> 00:20:43,287
Why?

393
00:20:43,288 --> 00:20:44,224
To lead us into a trap?

394
00:20:44,225 --> 00:20:44,972
Maybe.

395
00:20:44,973 --> 00:20:46,409
He's not trying
to trap anybody.

396
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:47,610
He told us to stay away.

397
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,974
You're afraid to
go after this guy?

398
00:20:49,975 --> 00:20:51,286
You're the one who
should be afraid.

399
00:20:51,287 --> 00:20:53,137
According to him,
i come out of this.

400
00:20:53,412 --> 00:20:54,862
Maybe we don't
have a choice.

401
00:20:54,975 --> 00:20:56,848
Haven't his experiences
and ours proven

402
00:20:56,849 --> 00:20:58,163
we can't
change the outcome?

403
00:20:58,164 --> 00:20:59,097
There's always a choice.

404
00:20:59,098 --> 00:21:00,098
There has to be.

405
00:21:00,662 --> 00:21:01,786
If it's all fate, then
we're just going through

406
00:21:01,787 --> 00:21:04,087
the motions and none of
it means a damn thing.

407
00:21:04,976 --> 00:21:05,976
That's one theory.

408
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:07,524
Consider it rejected.

409
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:10,051
Nobody controls
my destiny but me.

410
00:21:10,538 --> 00:21:12,037
That's what we'd all like
to believe, isn't it?

411
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:12,725
You don't?

412
00:21:12,726 --> 00:21:13,726
Say you're right,

413
00:21:13,914 --> 00:21:15,162
and we can save
our own asses

414
00:21:15,163 --> 00:21:17,663
by leaving this guy out there
along with his guns,
if he uses those guns,

415
00:21:17,664 --> 00:21:19,614
and even one innocent
person gets hurt,

416
00:21:21,289 --> 00:21:23,100
then we've all got
blood on our hands.

417
00:21:23,101 --> 00:21:24,101
I agree.

418
00:21:24,163 --> 00:21:25,163
It's our risk.

419
00:21:25,537 --> 00:21:26,537
Our choice.

420
00:21:57,412 --> 00:21:58,412
Doesn't look wired.

421
00:22:15,977 --> 00:22:16,977
No signs of life.

422
00:22:17,163 --> 00:22:18,213
We're ready to go in.

423
00:22:19,915 --> 00:22:20,915
Got it, proceed.

424
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:23,541
Wait!

425
00:22:23,915 --> 00:22:24,915
Everyone hold.

426
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:26,664
What?

427
00:22:26,826 --> 00:22:28,826
Ethan said he was going
to die by the orange door.

428
00:22:29,092 --> 00:22:30,803
Good, so we know we're
in the right place.

429
00:22:30,942 --> 00:22:32,565
At least
let me go in first.

430
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:37,541
We're going in.

431
00:22:52,477 --> 00:22:53,101
We're in.

432
00:22:53,102 --> 00:22:54,289
Headed for the upper level.

433
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,290
Keep your eyes open,

434
00:22:55,914 --> 00:22:57,564
this guy has
a lot of fire power.

435
00:23:01,106 --> 00:23:02,206
Riley, you reading us?

436
00:23:02,792 --> 00:23:03,792
Clear as day.

437
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:06,040
Scanning for
other heat signatures.

438
00:23:06,854 --> 00:23:07,854
Keep us posted.

439
00:23:12,356 --> 00:23:13,656
All quiet
down here, boss.

440
00:23:16,664 --> 00:23:18,814
Keep looking, he's
gotta be here somewhere.

441
00:23:20,917 --> 00:23:22,317
Maureen,
what's your status?

442
00:23:22,355 --> 00:23:23,755
Side door,
southwest corner.

443
00:23:28,378 --> 00:23:29,378
No one here.

444
00:23:30,002 --> 00:23:31,602
Nobody has been
here for months.

445
00:23:32,002 --> 00:23:33,052
This is a total bust.

446
00:23:34,503 --> 00:23:35,903
So much for
the doodle clue.

447
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:39,226
At least you're alive.

448
00:23:52,316 --> 00:23:53,316
What's all this?

449
00:23:54,252 --> 00:23:57,128
There were usable prints
on that sheet of paper
from the gun place.

450
00:23:57,129 --> 00:23:59,929
They matched up with a few
more aliases for ethan grant.

451
00:24:03,754 --> 00:24:05,204
So i'm running
them all down.

452
00:24:14,254 --> 00:24:15,253
Looks like
a lot of work.

453
00:24:15,254 --> 00:24:16,754
Yeah, well...
Part of the job.

454
00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:23,602
I was wondering if you could
pull up the audio files

455
00:24:26,564 --> 00:24:28,214
of ethan grant's
emergency calls.

456
00:24:29,315 --> 00:24:30,315
Okay.

457
00:24:30,691 --> 00:24:32,700
But if you've already got
all the servers running...

458
00:24:32,701 --> 00:24:33,751
I'd love to help you.

459
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,000
I can grab them right now.

460
00:24:38,448 --> 00:24:40,048
You just wait
right there, okay?

461
00:25:05,139 --> 00:25:06,189
Here you go, my dear.

462
00:25:06,888 --> 00:25:09,338
We'll have a listen
to these together, i suppose.

463
00:25:10,265 --> 00:25:11,386
Yeah.

464
00:25:16,034 --> 00:25:17,664
Check these out later.

465
00:25:37,283 --> 00:25:39,017
Agent vasco.

466
00:25:39,239 --> 00:25:40,688
Ethan,
where are you?

467
00:25:41,066 --> 00:25:42,511
I knew you'd come here.

468
00:25:42,603 --> 00:25:43,827
I saw it.

469
00:25:44,649 --> 00:25:45,953
I believe you.

470
00:25:46,152 --> 00:25:49,114
And i believe your premonition
about me and my team.

471
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:51,265
How do i stop it?

472
00:25:51,361 --> 00:25:55,419
You don't understand,
you can't stop fate,
no one can.

473
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:57,954
It's like a living thing,

474
00:25:57,997 --> 00:25:59,790
it swallows us
all into darkness.

475
00:26:00,105 --> 00:26:01,652
What are you doing here?

476
00:26:02,024 --> 00:26:03,503
And why did you send
me that warning?

477
00:26:03,596 --> 00:26:05,608
On the slim chance that you
might be the one

478
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,553
who saves us all
from the abyss.

479
00:26:08,128 --> 00:26:09,517
I don't understand.

480
00:26:10,315 --> 00:26:14,523
These disasters i see don't
just spontaneously happen.

481
00:26:14,731 --> 00:26:17,591
There's a chain of events
leading up to each one.

482
00:26:20,432 --> 00:26:21,431
Where do i come in?

483
00:26:21,432 --> 00:26:23,372
By the time i see what's
going to happen,

484
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:26,023
my opportunity to break
the chain has already passed.

485
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:27,810
But not for me.

486
00:26:27,811 --> 00:26:28,811
You are only hope.

487
00:26:28,995 --> 00:26:29,995
Futile as it may be.

488
00:26:30,746 --> 00:26:32,371
It's also the only hope
your friends have

489
00:26:32,372 --> 00:26:34,722
to survive the darkness
that's written on them.

490
00:26:34,808 --> 00:26:36,158
I've tried
warning my team.

491
00:26:37,561 --> 00:26:38,761
They won't listen to me.

492
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,260
Now you know how i feel.

493
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:42,684
When it's closing in on you

494
00:26:42,685 --> 00:26:44,335
and you have
no place else to go,

495
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:47,036
we already found the tosrona
building downtown.

496
00:26:48,433 --> 00:26:50,783
The one
with the orange door,
where you said...

497
00:26:51,685 --> 00:26:52,685
Where i die.

498
00:26:52,747 --> 00:26:53,797
So stay away from it.

499
00:26:56,498 --> 00:26:57,798
Come out so i can see you.

500
00:26:58,623 --> 00:27:00,935
Let me bring you in right
now, safely and quietly.

501
00:27:00,936 --> 00:27:02,184
I have no choice anymore.

502
00:27:02,185 --> 00:27:03,746
No matter what i do,
no matter how hard i try,
i can't change this.

503
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:04,897
Fate will have her way.

504
00:27:06,998 --> 00:27:08,548
Fate didn't buy
all those guns,

505
00:27:09,312 --> 00:27:11,062
and destiny won't
pull the trigger.

506
00:27:14,185 --> 00:27:16,235
If anyone on my team
members are injured,

507
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:19,560
i'm going to hold you
personally responsible.

508
00:27:20,623 --> 00:27:22,123
You're wrong
about that, jane.

509
00:27:22,437 --> 00:27:24,037
Our lives are in
your hands now.

510
00:27:25,309 --> 00:27:26,309
One link.

511
00:27:26,623 --> 00:27:27,623
Any way.

512
00:27:32,063 --> 00:27:34,413
Just turn yourself over
and put an end to this.

513
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:37,750
What i have here,
will protect my friends

514
00:27:37,751 --> 00:27:39,151
and put an end
to your pain.

515
00:27:43,123 --> 00:27:44,223
And take away my gift.

516
00:27:48,062 --> 00:27:49,112
Your gift is torture.

517
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,700
It's a torture
i couldn't live without.

518
00:27:51,937 --> 00:27:53,185
It's helped me
live in a world

519
00:27:53,186 --> 00:27:55,036
that has little
but pain to offer me.

520
00:27:55,812 --> 00:27:57,512
Like you said,
i do have a choice.

521
00:27:58,935 --> 00:27:59,935
I'm sorry, jane.

522
00:28:00,125 --> 00:28:01,325
Doesn't happen
this way.

523
00:28:02,124 --> 00:28:02,623
Sorry ma'am.

524
00:28:02,624 --> 00:28:03,624
Read the sign.

525
00:28:03,936 --> 00:28:04,936
Men only.

526
00:28:05,813 --> 00:28:06,813
Just a minute.

527
00:28:07,126 --> 00:28:08,226
You have to leave now.

528
00:28:20,702 --> 00:28:21,702
Here we go.

529
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:23,702
Grant won the state
spelling bee

530
00:28:23,703 --> 00:28:25,053
when he was
nine years old.

531
00:28:26,262 --> 00:28:28,112
That should crack
the case wide open.

532
00:28:28,453 --> 00:28:29,803
Hey, jane,
what's going on?

533
00:28:30,139 --> 00:28:30,638
Vasco.

534
00:28:30,639 --> 00:28:32,137
Tell me that's a
pint of tequila...

535
00:28:32,138 --> 00:28:33,488
Because i'm losing my mind.

536
00:28:35,326 --> 00:28:37,826
I have to do something
to break the chain somehow.

537
00:28:40,138 --> 00:28:41,138
Sorry.

538
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:44,689
Jane?

539
00:29:00,076 --> 00:29:01,176
You're absolutely sure

540
00:29:01,325 --> 00:29:02,925
jane is the one
who tranked you?

541
00:29:03,138 --> 00:29:04,988
I think i know what
vasco looks like.

542
00:29:05,823 --> 00:29:06,823
It was jane.

543
00:29:08,073 --> 00:29:10,136
She calibrated the dose to
keep you out for an hour.

544
00:29:10,137 --> 00:29:11,137
Just long enough.

545
00:29:12,387 --> 00:29:13,387
For what?

546
00:29:15,903 --> 00:29:16,903
Easy, easy...

547
00:29:18,777 --> 00:29:20,877
There's some damage
to your workstation...

548
00:29:23,904 --> 00:29:25,154
What do you mean, damage?

549
00:29:26,526 --> 00:29:27,526
Oh, man...

550
00:29:28,718 --> 00:29:29,718
Riley...

551
00:29:36,593 --> 00:29:37,593
Oh, no, no, no!

552
00:29:45,466 --> 00:29:45,968
I don't understand.

553
00:29:45,969 --> 00:29:47,069
Why would she do this?

554
00:29:47,466 --> 00:29:48,466
To cover her tracks.

555
00:29:50,529 --> 00:29:51,777
I just stopped
by jane's place.

556
00:29:51,778 --> 00:29:53,403
There's some clothes
and a suitcase missing.

557
00:29:53,404 --> 00:29:55,004
But she left her
locator behind.

558
00:29:56,402 --> 00:29:58,902
Will somebody tell me
what the hell is going on?!!

559
00:29:59,092 --> 00:30:02,155
Jane's still trying
to change the future
that ethan grant predicted.

560
00:30:02,156 --> 00:30:03,156
By leaving town?

561
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:06,279
She's probably trying
to get as far away from ethan,

562
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,280
the tosrona factory,
and us as possible.

563
00:30:08,281 --> 00:30:11,153
Without her,
the premonition can't play out
the way he saw it.

564
00:30:11,154 --> 00:30:13,779
She did this thinking we
can't find grant by tomorrow.

565
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,528
Tomorrow?

566
00:30:14,529 --> 00:30:15,155
You mean today.

567
00:30:15,156 --> 00:30:16,206
It's almost 6:00 a.m.

568
00:30:16,466 --> 00:30:17,466
Can you fix it?

569
00:30:18,028 --> 00:30:20,078
I'm good but i can't
bring back the dead.

570
00:30:21,656 --> 00:30:22,656
Unless...

571
00:30:23,219 --> 00:30:24,219
Wait a minute...

572
00:30:32,235 --> 00:30:34,431
Ok, this is one of the first
handheld processors.

573
00:30:35,957 --> 00:30:36,998
It's a collector's item.

574
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:38,547
Which is helpful
because...

575
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:42,159
because it has an early version
of my personal operating system.

576
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:43,873
It'll be
excruciatingly slow.

577
00:30:44,111 --> 00:30:46,511
You know what kids, law
enforcement did function

578
00:30:46,797 --> 00:30:48,107
before the advent
of the computer.

579
00:30:48,108 --> 00:30:49,797
We'll just have
to investigate
the old-fashioned way.

580
00:30:49,798 --> 00:30:51,483
Connor, you and i,
we're going to sarah grant's

581
00:30:51,484 --> 00:30:53,733
it's the closest thing
we've found to a home base
for ethan.

582
00:30:53,734 --> 00:30:54,483
What about jane?

583
00:30:54,484 --> 00:30:55,934
How are we going
to find her?

584
00:30:56,172 --> 00:30:57,172
We're not.

585
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:00,010
There's no indication
that she's in danger.

586
00:31:00,173 --> 00:31:02,373
Besides, with a head
start and her skills...

587
00:31:03,423 --> 00:31:04,473
No, we stay on ethan.

588
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:13,086
So i see
only one bed here,

589
00:31:13,609 --> 00:31:14,922
where did
your brother sleep?

590
00:31:14,923 --> 00:31:16,123
That's a pull-out couch.

591
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:18,799
Let's check it out.

592
00:31:19,233 --> 00:31:21,926
Was ethan's the only
one who slept on it,
in the last few months?

593
00:31:21,927 --> 00:31:22,927
Yeah.

594
00:31:41,262 --> 00:31:42,262
Ugh...

595
00:31:46,076 --> 00:31:47,976
Vasco, i'm going
to kill you for this.

596
00:32:01,638 --> 00:32:02,638
What'd you find?

597
00:32:04,828 --> 00:32:05,828
It looks like lint.

598
00:32:16,953 --> 00:32:17,953
Ethan's?

599
00:32:18,326 --> 00:32:19,326
I guess.

600
00:32:23,766 --> 00:32:26,116
This guy needs
to be chipped sooner than later.

601
00:32:30,201 --> 00:32:31,201
Andre.

602
00:32:40,828 --> 00:32:42,278
I want a sample
of that dirt.

603
00:32:48,515 --> 00:32:50,315
The car had overheated
and so had i,

604
00:32:50,767 --> 00:32:52,514
the only thing that
mattered to me was knowing

605
00:32:52,515 --> 00:32:55,715
there was
no way i could get back in time
to fulfill my destiny.

606
00:33:01,391 --> 00:33:02,891
Here's the breakdown
on your dirt.

607
00:33:02,892 --> 00:33:04,992
Nothing too surprising
in its composition.

608
00:33:05,204 --> 00:33:07,329
But distinctive enough
to tell us where it came from?

609
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:09,764
If we had geographic samples
to compare it to, sure.

610
00:33:09,765 --> 00:33:11,389
Who might have
that kind of data?

611
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,740
The u.s. Geological survey?

612
00:33:13,078 --> 00:33:14,078
The epa?

613
00:33:14,391 --> 00:33:16,391
Even if they agreed to run
the analysis,

614
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,513
we'd have to wait our turn,
it could take months.

615
00:33:18,514 --> 00:33:19,514
Then we won't ask.

616
00:33:20,205 --> 00:33:21,205
Riley...

617
00:33:21,702 --> 00:33:23,602
You want me to hack
the epa with this?

618
00:33:24,078 --> 00:33:25,328
Are you saying you can't?

619
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:26,890
Of course i can.

620
00:33:28,203 --> 00:33:29,553
It's just a
matter of time.

621
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:31,579
Within the hour
would be nice.

622
00:33:31,641 --> 00:33:34,191
But decrypting the access
codes alone would take...

623
00:33:34,517 --> 00:33:37,767
Of course, you don't
actually need full access
to their database.

624
00:33:39,889 --> 00:33:41,578
Just comparative soil and
pollutant analysis...

625
00:33:41,579 --> 00:33:43,429
Which their computer
could do for me.

626
00:33:44,893 --> 00:33:45,893
There you go.

627
00:34:32,456 --> 00:34:33,392
This is tosrona.

628
00:34:33,393 --> 00:34:34,204
It's still empty.

629
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:36,203
The whole district is
pretty much abandoned.

630
00:34:36,204 --> 00:34:37,204
There's no one here.

631
00:34:37,893 --> 00:34:38,086
No one has
been for months.

632
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,670
Here's the question
of the century,

633
00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:52,569
what's a police
training facility

634
00:34:53,171 --> 00:34:56,521
that looks exactly like
the tosrona shoe factory
doing way out here

635
00:34:58,045 --> 00:34:59,845
at the exact spot
my car broke down?

636
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,259
And why is andre's
suv parked outside?

637
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,820
Okay, that's two questions,
but who's counting when you're

638
00:35:08,235 --> 00:35:10,085
about to come
face to face with fate.

639
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:52,109
Alright, i saw movement
in the north-west corner.

640
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,110
Hang on.

641
00:35:56,862 --> 00:35:58,062
Yeah, north-west corner.

642
00:36:00,484 --> 00:36:01,484
This is going down.

643
00:36:01,799 --> 00:36:03,999
It won't be what he
predicted without vasco.

644
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:04,984
Let's find out.

645
00:36:04,985 --> 00:36:06,233
Alright check your comms.

646
00:36:06,234 --> 00:36:06,984
Maureen?

647
00:36:06,985 --> 00:36:07,796
Check.

648
00:36:07,797 --> 00:36:08,171
Connor?

649
00:36:08,172 --> 00:36:09,172
Check.

650
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,609
Alright, now
watch your footing,

651
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,410
we know he has mines
and trip wires.

652
00:36:21,796 --> 00:36:23,359
Maybe some
home-made goodies too.

653
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,360
Probably.

654
00:36:24,862 --> 00:36:26,312
Alright, take
first positions

655
00:36:29,673 --> 00:36:31,486
you don't move until
i give the word.

656
00:36:31,487 --> 00:36:32,487
Understood?

657
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:33,109
Copy.

658
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,109
Copy.

659
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,110
All right, move out.

660
00:37:00,798 --> 00:37:01,734
Bauers, are you hit?

661
00:37:01,735 --> 00:37:04,485
No, but i don't think this
stealth approach is working.

662
00:37:05,797 --> 00:37:06,736
Connor, you in position?

663
00:37:06,737 --> 00:37:07,737
Yeah, i'm here.

664
00:37:09,174 --> 00:37:10,974
Alright, i'm going to
draw his fire.

665
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,150
When i do, i
want you to...

666
00:37:15,353 --> 00:37:16,353
Connor, wait!

667
00:37:17,792 --> 00:37:18,792
Connor!!!

668
00:37:20,729 --> 00:37:23,229
Bauer, why don't you lay
down some fire,
on three.

669
00:37:23,601 --> 00:37:24,416
Alright, 1...

670
00:37:24,417 --> 00:37:25,417
2...

671
00:37:26,791 --> 00:37:27,791
3!!

672
00:37:46,728 --> 00:37:49,328
Don't worry, andre, i'm
going to get you outta here.

673
00:37:49,729 --> 00:37:50,729
How bad is it?

674
00:37:56,853 --> 00:37:57,853
What the?

675
00:37:58,918 --> 00:37:59,968
That one really hurt.

676
00:38:01,477 --> 00:38:02,727
But i thought andre died?

677
00:38:03,103 --> 00:38:04,453
I drugged connor and andre.

678
00:38:05,104 --> 00:38:06,104
But...

679
00:38:06,229 --> 00:38:07,279
Don't you understand?

680
00:38:07,729 --> 00:38:08,829
I died in their place.

681
00:38:09,292 --> 00:38:10,791
You're trying to
fake out fate?

682
00:38:10,792 --> 00:38:12,042
Who says it's a fake-out?

683
00:38:12,479 --> 00:38:14,329
Maybe this is
exactly what ethan saw,

684
00:38:14,605 --> 00:38:16,405
and he only interpreted
it as seeing

685
00:38:16,541 --> 00:38:17,854
three different
people die.

686
00:38:17,855 --> 00:38:18,955
There's only been two.

687
00:38:19,043 --> 00:38:22,602
Logic was one of
maureen's strong points,
it just didn't always hit home

688
00:38:22,603 --> 00:38:24,553
when it came to
applying it to herself.

689
00:38:24,919 --> 00:38:26,269
That leaves
one left to go.

690
00:38:28,354 --> 00:38:29,354
Sorry, mo.

691
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:18,856
so here we are.

692
00:39:19,797 --> 00:39:20,797
Yeah.

693
00:39:21,855 --> 00:39:22,855
Here we are.

694
00:39:30,979 --> 00:39:32,879
The chip will suppress
your abilities.

695
00:39:33,168 --> 00:39:34,218
No more premonitions.

696
00:39:35,856 --> 00:39:37,006
But i saw my own death.

697
00:39:38,479 --> 00:39:40,529
You shouldn't believe
everything you see.

698
00:39:50,114 --> 00:39:51,668
So it is possible.

699
00:39:53,981 --> 00:39:55,981
The things i see...
They can be changed.

700
00:39:56,892 --> 00:39:57,887
Come on.

701
00:40:03,469 --> 00:40:04,614
Watch out!

702
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,154
Noooo!!!!

703
00:41:07,316 --> 00:41:08,241
Connor?

704
00:41:16,046 --> 00:41:17,063
Another room.

705
00:41:30,266 --> 00:41:31,266
Hey,

706
00:41:32,951 --> 00:41:34,451
you saved three
lives tonight.

707
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:37,840
Ethan came to me for help,
and he still ended up dead.

708
00:41:38,392 --> 00:41:40,392
While i came through,
without a scratch.

709
00:41:43,516 --> 00:41:44,516
Jane 1-13?

710
00:41:47,453 --> 00:41:48,453
What's that?

711
00:42:17,203 --> 00:42:19,903
Not only was
our guy paranoid,
he was a hypochondriac.

712
00:42:21,143 --> 00:42:22,193
No, he was preparing.

713
00:42:24,392 --> 00:42:25,392
For what?

714
00:42:31,517 --> 00:42:32,667
Whatever he saw coming.

715
00:42:36,266 --> 00:42:39,077
Most of us would give anything
for a peak into the future,

716
00:42:39,078 --> 00:42:41,028
ethan had no choice
but to see his own.

717
00:42:41,955 --> 00:42:43,755
And it tortured him
to the very end.

718
00:42:45,081 --> 00:42:46,981
It's second nature
to curse our flaws,

719
00:42:47,956 --> 00:42:51,356
and we do convince ourselves
that life would be easier
without them.

720
00:42:52,392 --> 00:42:54,692
Ethan's ability to se
the future was his flaw,

721
00:42:56,144 --> 00:42:58,294
a vision he was compelled
to share with me.

722
00:42:59,018 --> 00:43:01,580
And maybe it's because i have
my own issues with confining.

723
00:43:01,581 --> 00:43:02,931
But i can't
help wondering,

724
00:43:03,643 --> 00:43:04,003
what did'nt he share?

725
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
