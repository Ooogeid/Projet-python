1
00:00:00,786 --> 00:00:02,220
My name is jane vasco.

2
00:00:02,254 --> 00:00:03,607
I could use you
on my team.

3
00:00:03,653 --> 00:00:07,179
I work for a secret government
agency that hunts neuros.

4
00:00:07,214 --> 00:00:11,272
People who can do dangerous
things with their minds.

5
00:00:11,338 --> 00:00:12,783
On my first assignment...

6
00:00:12,852 --> 00:00:15,060
Something a little
weird happened,

7
00:00:15,095 --> 00:00:17,754
okay, something really weird.

8
00:00:18,586 --> 00:00:21,766
Until I get some answers
I'm getting on with my life,

9
00:00:21,835 --> 00:00:23,394
doing my job.

10
00:00:23,428 --> 00:00:25,232
Stocking up on aspirin,

11
00:00:25,347 --> 00:00:26,295
because...

12
00:00:26,665 --> 00:00:28,633
I gotta tell ya

13
00:00:28,702 --> 00:00:30,193
pain's a bitch!

14
00:00:35,155 --> 00:00:37,677
They say bad things
come in threes.

15
00:00:37,735 --> 00:00:39,816
I've had about eight so
far today

16
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:42,568
so I gotta think
I've had my quota.

17
00:00:44,529 --> 00:00:45,527
Maybe not.

18
00:00:47,063 --> 00:00:48,335
Can I help you?

19
00:00:50,786 --> 00:00:52,737
Were we supposed to
get together tonight?

20
00:00:52,784 --> 00:00:54,430
It doesn't matter,
thank god you're here

21
00:00:54,499 --> 00:00:57,123
because I can't get
my stupid key to work.

22
00:00:59,817 --> 00:01:01,089
What's wrong?

23
00:01:01,527 --> 00:01:03,713
I'm sorry,
who are you?

24
00:01:06,456 --> 00:01:08,607
Look, I've had
a hell of a day.

25
00:01:08,664 --> 00:01:10,757
All I want is
a couple tylenol

26
00:01:10,803 --> 00:01:13,924
- and a dozen glasses of wine.
- Look, Miss, I...

27
00:01:14,005 --> 00:01:15,589
I really don't have time for this.

28
00:01:15,646 --> 00:01:16,606
Brian, it's not funny.

29
00:01:16,675 --> 00:01:17,889
No, you're right,
it's not.

30
00:01:17,924 --> 00:01:22,561
Either go now or I am going
to have to call the police.

31
00:01:22,584 --> 00:01:23,358
Daddy

32
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,780
When're we going to eat?

33
00:01:26,812 --> 00:01:28,295
In a minute, sweetie.

34
00:01:28,376 --> 00:01:29,451
Who's she?

35
00:01:31,555 --> 00:01:32,133
No one.

36
00:01:32,896 --> 00:01:34,896
Why don't you go back
and finish getting ready

37
00:01:34,942 --> 00:01:37,070
mom'll be home soon, okay?

38
00:01:52,313 --> 00:01:54,964
You're not going to believe
what happened today, people.

39
00:01:55,022 --> 00:01:55,970
Very weird.

40
00:01:56,028 --> 00:01:57,253
Very neuro.

41
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,652
Hope someone has
an explanation,

42
00:01:58,687 --> 00:02:00,595
because I have no
idea what the...

43
00:02:35,925 --> 00:02:37,531
What the hell are you
doing down here?

44
00:02:37,578 --> 00:02:38,283
Joe.

45
00:02:43,057 --> 00:02:44,768
Joe, it's me, jane.

46
00:02:46,595 --> 00:02:48,225
I don't want no trouble.

47
00:02:48,595 --> 00:02:51,612
So just get the hell out of
here and leave me alone.

48
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,665
I need some answers, joe.

49
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,850
What the hell
is going on here?

50
00:02:57,133 --> 00:02:58,636
I'll shoot,

51
00:02:58,798 --> 00:03:00,127
I'll do it.

52
00:03:00,174 --> 00:03:01,653
Go ahead.

53
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,341
We both know I'll heal.

54
00:03:26,424 --> 00:03:28,066
Andre, talk to me.

55
00:03:28,227 --> 00:03:29,741
And tell me
you know who I am.

56
00:03:29,783 --> 00:03:30,967
Jane, listen to me,

57
00:03:31,025 --> 00:03:32,412
they shut down nico,

58
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:34,712
they're destroying any evidence
of the team's existence.

59
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:37,633
Joe's been re-programmed,
they killed connor and riley.

60
00:03:37,682 --> 00:03:38,970
They're getting
close to me.

61
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:42,005
It's just a matter of time
before they find you.

62
00:03:42,364 --> 00:03:44,422
Why is this happening!

63
00:03:45,335 --> 00:03:46,242
There's got to be...

64
00:03:59,843 --> 00:04:05,878
Transcript : swsub.com
Presync : IceFre@k

65
00:04:13,603 --> 00:04:14,516
You tell me.

66
00:04:14,574 --> 00:04:16,794
Should I be
paranoid right now.

67
00:04:16,863 --> 00:04:19,060
Most of my team's
been assassinated,

68
00:04:19,129 --> 00:04:21,034
joe has been brainwashed,

69
00:04:21,071 --> 00:04:22,657
and I can't even begin to understand

70
00:04:22,715 --> 00:04:24,530
what's going on
with my boyfriend.

71
00:04:26,287 --> 00:04:28,842
I'm also about to be offed.

72
00:04:28,914 --> 00:04:31,019
I hate the word "offed".

73
00:04:31,516 --> 00:04:33,562
I hate the concept more.

74
00:04:34,903 --> 00:04:37,181
Andre says they're trying
to wipe out any trace of

75
00:04:37,238 --> 00:04:38,626
the unit and what we do.

76
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,279
I can't let that happen.

77
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,972
Since I don't have time
to write my memoirs,

78
00:04:43,672 --> 00:04:46,273
I've got to find a way, and fast.

79
00:04:47,776 --> 00:04:50,227
Which is why I'm
thinking about Simon.

80
00:04:51,256 --> 00:04:53,811
Well, I suppose I should
be flattered,

81
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:55,328
an entire team

82
00:04:55,389 --> 00:04:56,693
the best of the best,

83
00:04:56,762 --> 00:05:00,207
devoted to following and finding
people like me.

84
00:05:00,276 --> 00:05:04,184
Your friend, Riley, his
mind is a vault of information,

85
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,191
neuros...

86
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,875
That's what you call us.

87
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,739
At least I'm glad to know that
I'm not alone in my uniqueness.

88
00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:19,051
Today is your lucky day, pal,

89
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,394
because I'm about
to arrange for you

90
00:05:21,453 --> 00:05:22,713
to meet the rest of
the freaks

91
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,487
so you don't feel so lonely.

92
00:05:25,405 --> 00:05:28,287
If you ever want to
see your friend again, intact,

93
00:05:28,752 --> 00:05:30,978
that might not be the wise
thing to do.

94
00:05:31,047 --> 00:05:31,779
Wait

95
00:05:33,336 --> 00:05:34,834
let's hear him out.

96
00:05:35,261 --> 00:05:38,142
We don't even know if anyone
can restore riley's memory.

97
00:05:38,188 --> 00:05:38,943
Oh, I can.

98
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,730
I can steal knowledge,
I can transfer knowledge

99
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,324
and I can restore knowledge.

100
00:05:52,538 --> 00:05:53,897
It's jane vasco.

101
00:05:54,214 --> 00:05:55,701
I need to see you.

102
00:06:03,202 --> 00:06:07,299
A '71 latour should be
savored not gulped.

103
00:06:07,357 --> 00:06:09,506
Savoring's not in
my life right now.

104
00:06:10,831 --> 00:06:14,002
I don't even know if life
is in my life right now.

105
00:06:14,793 --> 00:06:16,687
Why are you here, jane?

106
00:06:17,547 --> 00:06:19,092
My team has been taken out

107
00:06:19,138 --> 00:06:21,008
and I'm supposed to be next.

108
00:06:21,101 --> 00:06:23,227
If that happens,

109
00:06:23,297 --> 00:06:25,098
the world will never know.

110
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,631
About us.

111
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,187
About what you did to us.

112
00:06:29,338 --> 00:06:32,683
For good or bad,
there needs to be a record.

113
00:06:35,367 --> 00:06:37,246
And I thought you were
here to chip me...

114
00:06:37,316 --> 00:06:39,500
You're here for me
to pick your brain.

115
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:40,266
Yes.

116
00:06:42,818 --> 00:06:44,472
You realize...

117
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:46,167
That you're... dying.

118
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:47,851
I know.

119
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:52,254
But I still think you can
get the story down

120
00:06:52,301 --> 00:06:54,357
and put it somewhere safe.

121
00:06:54,778 --> 00:06:56,555
Are you willing to help me?

122
00:06:58,065 --> 00:06:59,843
Yes, I will help you.

123
00:07:02,573 --> 00:07:05,372
So, how exactly does this work?

124
00:07:07,015 --> 00:07:08,374
Take my hands.

125
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:14,252
Just envision your experiences.

126
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:23,011
But there's so many.

127
00:07:25,811 --> 00:07:27,763
Start at the beginning

128
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:34,896
Have a seat.

129
00:07:40,611 --> 00:07:43,736
Your current investigation has
been terminated by the director.

130
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,503
Why?

131
00:07:44,654 --> 00:07:47,686
She chose not to share
that with me, agent vasco.

132
00:07:48,661 --> 00:07:50,648
I could use you
on my team.

133
00:07:51,031 --> 00:07:53,614
Only I don't know what
your team does, do I?

134
00:07:53,683 --> 00:07:56,041
We hunt neuros,
neurological aberrant,

135
00:07:56,069 --> 00:07:57,727
six years ago
the government became aware

136
00:07:57,761 --> 00:08:00,232
of a genetic aberration
appearing in the population.

137
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,347
Those with the aberration

138
00:08:01,405 --> 00:08:03,807
posses a unique ability
to influence others.

139
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:05,599
Welcome to the freak show.

140
00:08:06,211 --> 00:08:08,220
Someone is dealing
substandard medications

141
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:09,045
on the black market.

142
00:08:09,085 --> 00:08:11,554
We believe there's
a neuro behind the operation.

143
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:14,214
The drugs in question are made
and manufactured by vonotek.

144
00:08:14,272 --> 00:08:15,492
So we got to go back in.

145
00:08:15,582 --> 00:08:17,278
Yes, but not solo.

146
00:08:17,661 --> 00:08:19,369
I want you and jane inside.

147
00:08:19,903 --> 00:08:22,308
You can play tag with hyde
and watch each other's back.

148
00:08:22,354 --> 00:08:23,946
He's vonotek's
head of security.

149
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:26,420
Report to security
on floor 1-14

150
00:08:26,857 --> 00:08:28,309
take the express elevator.

151
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,714
Blue one's hyde,
jane's on him.

152
00:08:31,608 --> 00:08:34,013
Just landed on
the 46th floor.

153
00:08:54,132 --> 00:08:56,320
What the hell are you doing?!!

154
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,000
It's me, it's jane!!

155
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:30,043
Why am I not dead?

156
00:09:31,742 --> 00:09:34,569
Agent vasco just
survived a 46 storey fall.

157
00:09:34,652 --> 00:09:37,076
Lacerations, contusions,
internal organ damage,

158
00:09:37,169 --> 00:09:38,694
she doesn't have any.

159
00:09:40,191 --> 00:09:41,390
Not even a scratch.

160
00:09:41,454 --> 00:09:42,188
Is she...?

161
00:09:43,456 --> 00:09:45,877
Nothing in her blood work,
tissue samples, brain scan

162
00:09:45,912 --> 00:09:48,776
indicate anything related
to what we're dealing with.

163
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:50,079
Listen to me!

164
00:09:51,243 --> 00:09:53,486
Whatever the hell
is going on with me,

165
00:09:53,568 --> 00:09:55,965
I really need
to know what it is.

166
00:09:56,303 --> 00:09:57,164
Okay?

167
00:09:57,269 --> 00:09:58,817
I'll answers for you, jane.

168
00:09:58,852 --> 00:10:00,132
You have my word.

169
00:10:00,862 --> 00:10:02,594
Despite their differences,
we've discovered

170
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,843
a definable pattern
in their gene code.

171
00:10:04,941 --> 00:10:07,286
This aberration seems to
affect the neurological center

172
00:10:07,362 --> 00:10:09,155
of the frontal and cerebral cortex.

173
00:10:09,201 --> 00:10:11,005
But we've encountered
dozens of variations.

174
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:12,367
In how many people?

175
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:14,951
To date, almost 200.

176
00:10:16,232 --> 00:10:17,718
What the hell
are you talking about?

177
00:10:17,801 --> 00:10:20,222
Obviously a neuro that can
raise people from the dead.

178
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:21,234
Obviously.

179
00:10:22,095 --> 00:10:23,968
I came up with at least
a dozen other cases

180
00:10:24,028 --> 00:10:25,736
of corpses missing
from graveyards.

181
00:10:25,853 --> 00:10:27,531
All within the last
nine weeks.

182
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:28,425
They're all young.

183
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:29,496
And hot.

184
00:10:33,453 --> 00:10:34,617
I didn't hurt anybody.

185
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,468
You know
it isn't right.

186
00:10:36,514 --> 00:10:38,111
You have to make it stop.

187
00:10:38,842 --> 00:10:40,055
That's none of
your business!

188
00:10:40,113 --> 00:10:42,057
I know all about
being lonely, eric.

189
00:10:42,138 --> 00:10:44,512
This all started when
albert died.

190
00:10:44,955 --> 00:10:46,340
Albert's my friend.

191
00:10:46,561 --> 00:10:50,181
And you missed him
and you were lonely.

192
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,456
Why don't you chip
the little bastard.

193
00:10:58,526 --> 00:11:00,341
Can't get a clean shot
without hitting vasco.

194
00:11:00,388 --> 00:11:02,425
just dial the range vector
to three feet beyond.

195
00:11:02,471 --> 00:11:04,507
It'll pass right
through her.

196
00:11:21,255 --> 00:11:22,642
Eric, you're
going to be okay.

197
00:11:22,689 --> 00:11:24,313
All right ? Nobody's gonna hurt you.

198
00:11:24,446 --> 00:11:25,959
You're gonna be okay.

199
00:11:27,379 --> 00:11:28,720
Let's go kiddo!

200
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:30,583
Where are you taking me?

201
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,561
I didn't hurt anyone.

202
00:11:32,631 --> 00:11:34,400
It's gonna be okay.

203
00:11:40,463 --> 00:11:41,616
What's wrong?

204
00:11:43,504 --> 00:11:44,688
Where would
you have taken me

205
00:11:44,747 --> 00:11:46,189
if you hadn't left me here?

206
00:11:46,756 --> 00:11:48,447
To an internment center.

207
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,672
Internment center.

208
00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:54,647
It isn't like that.

209
00:11:55,542 --> 00:11:57,010
What is it like, jane?

210
00:11:58,356 --> 00:12:00,071
Have you seen it yourself?

211
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,422
No, but I've been assured...

212
00:12:02,481 --> 00:12:04,180
Assured by who ?

213
00:12:05,294 --> 00:12:07,605
The people who have
killed your team!

214
00:12:07,668 --> 00:12:10,061
The people who are
hunting you down?!

215
00:12:21,811 --> 00:12:23,231
You can't die now...

216
00:12:23,475 --> 00:12:24,441
You can't.

217
00:12:42,425 --> 00:12:44,007
I guess it was too much

218
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,257
I'm so sorry.

219
00:12:51,373 --> 00:12:51,984
Yes.

220
00:12:54,644 --> 00:12:55,773
You should be.

221
00:13:08,064 --> 00:13:09,158
The intent...

222
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:13,104
was to protect
the public from danger.

223
00:13:13,174 --> 00:13:16,514
And just what is your interpretation
of "danger" I wonder.

224
00:13:18,487 --> 00:13:20,099
I wish I could show you.

225
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,322
Why can't you?

226
00:13:24,732 --> 00:13:27,478
There is that little heart
attack episode you just had.

227
00:13:27,582 --> 00:13:28,967
I'll be just fine.

228
00:13:44,426 --> 00:13:45,691
You're savoring.

229
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,354
I'll try to remember that,

230
00:13:51,424 --> 00:13:53,891
the next time
I'm doing heart medication.

231
00:14:07,153 --> 00:14:08,213
They all
knew each other.

232
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,969
They'd all
worked together...

233
00:14:10,028 --> 00:14:11,401
Now they are all dead.

234
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:13,531
What happened to them?

235
00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:15,021
They died of old age.

236
00:14:16,103 --> 00:14:17,947
These women were healthy
one minute,

237
00:14:18,001 --> 00:14:20,048
rapidly aged and dead
the next.

238
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:23,182
I think we'll have to investigate this
from the inside.

239
00:14:27,389 --> 00:14:29,513
The only way I can
get into this dress

240
00:14:29,623 --> 00:14:31,334
is if I have it painted on.

241
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,396
Demarco designs his dresses for
girls with single digit bmis.

242
00:14:35,465 --> 00:14:37,153
You're just too healthy.

243
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,728
Good luck.

244
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,887
Public opinion is running pretty high,

245
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:46,606
people want someone
to blame.

246
00:14:46,676 --> 00:14:48,015
There is someone to blame!

247
00:14:48,073 --> 00:14:49,418
A pyromaniac neuro.

248
00:14:49,452 --> 00:14:50,628
Richard don't!!!!

249
00:14:50,686 --> 00:14:52,188
To hell with you!!!

250
00:15:09,594 --> 00:15:11,281
Seem to be dealing with
a neuro who

251
00:15:11,315 --> 00:15:12,376
seems to induce persistent

252
00:15:12,434 --> 00:15:14,598
visual hallucinations
in his victims.

253
00:15:15,552 --> 00:15:18,276
Connor, the last
time we saw you

254
00:15:18,322 --> 00:15:20,022
we left you
to question marty lento.

255
00:15:20,103 --> 00:15:22,178
The next here you were
in here guns blazing.

256
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:24,248
The neuro must have
got to him back at the factory

257
00:15:24,271 --> 00:15:25,954
when
you left with marty.

258
00:15:44,924 --> 00:15:47,496
Connor, what
are you doing man!!!!

259
00:15:55,134 --> 00:15:56,182
Connor stop!!!!

260
00:16:05,295 --> 00:16:07,121
It's okay, it's okay!!!

261
00:16:07,214 --> 00:16:08,550
It's jane!!!!

262
00:16:13,801 --> 00:16:15,710
That s.O.B. Got in my head!!!

263
00:16:23,111 --> 00:16:23,857
Yes.

264
00:16:25,194 --> 00:16:27,161
They were
unpleasant people.

265
00:16:27,671 --> 00:16:30,967
That's like saying
hitler had issues.

266
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:35,770
Simon, these people were
a danger to society,

267
00:16:35,851 --> 00:16:37,412
they were a danger
to themselves.

268
00:16:37,484 --> 00:16:41,488
You saw what I saw,
they had to be stopped!

269
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,153
They had to be stopped!

270
00:17:09,877 --> 00:17:10,657
So...

271
00:17:14,137 --> 00:17:17,105
We gathered all the people
together, good or bad,

272
00:17:17,186 --> 00:17:19,452
hunted them down and
shipped them off.

273
00:17:20,118 --> 00:17:21,598
I didn't always agree.

274
00:17:21,935 --> 00:17:23,623
But you went
along with it.

275
00:17:23,745 --> 00:17:24,877
Not always.

276
00:17:30,301 --> 00:17:31,931
The man is ethan grant,

277
00:17:32,524 --> 00:17:33,882
no criminal record, no nothing.

278
00:17:33,918 --> 00:17:35,840
He told the police that
he "saw" the plane crash

279
00:17:35,864 --> 00:17:36,995
before it happened.

280
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,764
There's no other evidence
connecting him to it.

281
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,036
But there's other calls, right?

282
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:41,616
The voice print from his
airline call

283
00:17:41,617 --> 00:17:43,483
matches three others
from the past six months,

284
00:17:43,484 --> 00:17:45,805
warning people about bad things
that were going to happen:

285
00:17:45,842 --> 00:17:47,098
a gas main explosion,

286
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,694
a fire at an elementary school,
and get this...

287
00:17:49,775 --> 00:17:52,557
A tornado that touched
down near amarillo, texas.

288
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,370
You heard what
the man said.

289
00:17:54,501 --> 00:17:55,683
If he's right,

290
00:17:55,813 --> 00:17:57,466
and so far you say
he has been,

291
00:17:57,536 --> 00:18:00,620
then three of you will die.

292
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,507
If you actually
believe that someone can

293
00:18:03,553 --> 00:18:04,356
see the future.

294
00:18:04,438 --> 00:18:06,590
Even if I don't
why risk it?

295
00:18:06,648 --> 00:18:08,429
He hasn't committed
any crime.

296
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,326
he's only been trying to
save people's lives.

297
00:18:10,373 --> 00:18:11,602
So far, yes.

298
00:18:11,627 --> 00:18:13,634
But if he is a neuro and
if he can see the future,

299
00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:15,092
you have to wonder
what else he can do.

300
00:18:15,138 --> 00:18:16,504
Why assume he's trying to hurt anyone?

301
00:18:16,527 --> 00:18:17,689
Because he can,

302
00:18:18,399 --> 00:18:20,801
traditional law enforcement
can't handle him.

303
00:18:20,855 --> 00:18:24,114
That power makes him and
every other neuro our problem.

304
00:18:24,196 --> 00:18:25,499
Even if it costs
us our lives.

305
00:18:25,592 --> 00:18:27,658
Let's leave this
alone, andre.

306
00:18:27,715 --> 00:18:28,977
Is he still in custody?

307
00:18:29,244 --> 00:18:29,943
No.

308
00:18:30,432 --> 00:18:31,735
They had to release him.

309
00:18:31,795 --> 00:18:33,318
Way to go, Feds.

310
00:18:34,796 --> 00:18:36,982
That's the address where
they picked him up.

311
00:18:37,184 --> 00:18:39,445
A house owned by
his sister, sarah.

312
00:18:44,051 --> 00:18:44,866
Hello?

313
00:18:45,506 --> 00:18:46,274
Ethan.

314
00:18:47,112 --> 00:18:48,346
Keep him on.

315
00:18:49,813 --> 00:18:51,791
Riley, you got that?
I need a trace.

316
00:18:51,838 --> 00:18:52,699
Got it.

317
00:18:54,654 --> 00:18:56,971
He says to tell the two agents
sitting in my living room

318
00:18:57,029 --> 00:18:58,906
that there's going
to be a terrible accident.

319
00:18:58,969 --> 00:19:00,085
Eleven people will die.

320
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,117
He's saying that they're not
gonna listen to him.

321
00:19:02,163 --> 00:19:03,881
Maybe they'll
listen to you.

322
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:13,251
You have to let
this one go, andre.

323
00:19:13,332 --> 00:19:15,288
Can't do it, jane,
you know that.

324
00:19:15,334 --> 00:19:17,895
He goes through what
we just went through every time

325
00:19:17,941 --> 00:19:19,344
he sees a disaster coming.

326
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:21,516
Now you want to act like one
of the government thugs

327
00:19:21,551 --> 00:19:23,183
that he's afraid
of and hunt him down.

328
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,353
That is just it,
maybe we can help him?

329
00:19:26,389 --> 00:19:27,809
So far we're doing
a bang-up job.

330
00:19:27,855 --> 00:19:28,985
No, I mean with his visions.

331
00:19:29,025 --> 00:19:30,948
If he's a neuro we can
chip him, give him some peace.

332
00:19:31,006 --> 00:19:33,162
Unless you want him to deal with this
for the rest of his life.

333
00:19:33,212 --> 00:19:36,056
No, you think ethan is some ticking time
bomb that needs to be defused.

334
00:19:36,115 --> 00:19:37,227
You don't care
about helping him.

335
00:19:37,273 --> 00:19:38,181
You do.

336
00:19:40,864 --> 00:19:43,226
I think we've got
a second neuro.

337
00:19:43,285 --> 00:19:46,206
Hit our suv this morning, hit
us at the marina this afternoon.

338
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:46,765
I got him!

339
00:19:46,823 --> 00:19:47,661
What're you saying?

340
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:49,896
We've got some lunatic
neuro stalking the team?

341
00:19:49,954 --> 00:19:51,280
It's starting
to look that way.

342
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:53,212
They'd need access
to our intel.

343
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,446
They got that.

344
00:19:54,515 --> 00:19:55,330
A leak?

345
00:19:58,076 --> 00:19:58,914
Holy!!!

346
00:19:58,961 --> 00:20:01,102
I would never do anything
to put this team in danger.

347
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:03,535
You would never do
anything consciously.

348
00:20:03,582 --> 00:20:06,392
I've discovered how
joseph's healing ability works.

349
00:20:06,468 --> 00:20:08,457
Jane, you've more than once
voiced your doubts

350
00:20:08,493 --> 00:20:09,842
about what it is we have to do.

351
00:20:09,898 --> 00:20:10,983
And, let's be frank,

352
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,449
on several occasions
you have deliberately

353
00:20:12,484 --> 00:20:14,090
disobeyed my orders.

354
00:20:14,183 --> 00:20:17,652
We believe joseph's energy
affected you or your mind,

355
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:19,863
in such a way
that your doubts

356
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,643
began to manifest themselves

357
00:20:21,706 --> 00:20:23,796
and started to work
against the team.

358
00:20:23,797 --> 00:20:24,729
I don't believe that.

359
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:26,322
I didn't think you would.

360
00:20:26,939 --> 00:20:28,404
I don't blame you

361
00:20:29,254 --> 00:20:30,034
but it's clear that

362
00:20:30,069 --> 00:20:32,094
you've become a liability.

363
00:20:32,199 --> 00:20:35,539
Now I'd prefer to not have
to restrain you.

364
00:20:59,656 --> 00:21:01,437
Convincing enough for you?

365
00:21:07,105 --> 00:21:08,618
Open up, let's go!!!

366
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:11,244
I wasn't expecting anyone.

367
00:21:12,432 --> 00:21:14,201
This should be interesting.

368
00:21:16,068 --> 00:21:19,543
They're about to find me
and try to kill me.

369
00:21:20,009 --> 00:21:22,257
Only I've yet
to be killed.

370
00:21:23,758 --> 00:21:27,436
It's not that I can't be,
It's just that I haven't yet.

371
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,557
Which begs the question what
are they gonna do to me?

372
00:21:33,616 --> 00:21:35,117
to achieve their goal.

373
00:21:36,851 --> 00:21:39,004
And how much is
it going to hurt.

374
00:21:52,033 --> 00:21:53,651
What the hell
are you doing?

375
00:21:53,709 --> 00:21:56,107
Finding something
worthy for us to take.

376
00:21:56,794 --> 00:21:58,460
What are
you talking about?

377
00:21:58,528 --> 00:21:59,599
Take us where?

378
00:22:00,353 --> 00:22:01,517
Bust it down!!

379
00:22:09,817 --> 00:22:12,168
Don't forget
to shut the door.

380
00:22:19,154 --> 00:22:21,436
I figured they'd have been
here, and they wouldn't

381
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,264
think I'd be stupid
enough to come back.

382
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:26,429
We're probably
safe for awhile.

383
00:22:26,464 --> 00:22:28,768
I thought you said
brian was here.

384
00:22:28,838 --> 00:22:29,734
He was.

385
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:32,929
They were.

386
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,293
Maybe they took him.

387
00:22:38,132 --> 00:22:39,412
I have no idea.

388
00:22:43,187 --> 00:22:44,746
What's jane 1-13.

389
00:22:47,249 --> 00:22:48,983
Jane 1-13?

390
00:22:51,275 --> 00:22:52,371
What's that?

391
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,587
We should continue.

392
00:23:00,961 --> 00:23:01,706
Yes.

393
00:23:04,566 --> 00:23:06,565
And then we can
find a corkscrew.

394
00:23:11,154 --> 00:23:13,861
What are you thinking
about now, jane!

395
00:23:20,515 --> 00:23:21,434
As quickly as you heal

396
00:23:21,492 --> 00:23:24,437
there are aspects of your
genetic structure that

397
00:23:24,507 --> 00:23:26,008
are a little weird.

398
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,957
I'm really going
to hate this.

399
00:23:37,826 --> 00:23:39,409
Don't ask me if I'm okay.

400
00:23:39,467 --> 00:23:40,573
I know what you're
trying to do,

401
00:23:40,631 --> 00:23:42,214
but I won't turn elyse
over to you.

402
00:23:42,307 --> 00:23:44,169
I know what
they can do here.

403
00:23:44,809 --> 00:23:47,091
I've seen them cure
people like elyse.

404
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:51,112
I know what they've
done for me.

405
00:23:51,228 --> 00:23:51,894
You?

406
00:23:55,302 --> 00:23:56,551
Oh, god!!!

407
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,730
Oh, god!!!

408
00:24:01,762 --> 00:24:06,305
Tell me, are you willing to take
a chance on a miracle?

409
00:24:22,769 --> 00:24:24,741
Lento!!!
get out of there!!

410
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:42,935
All I know is that It hurts like hell.

411
00:24:43,098 --> 00:24:44,826
Sorry, you can put this on,

412
00:24:44,884 --> 00:24:47,008
your shirt
is pretty much toast.

413
00:24:53,671 --> 00:24:55,812
So if my brain controls
my healing,

414
00:24:55,859 --> 00:24:58,509
I should be able to turn
the healing off.

415
00:25:07,861 --> 00:25:09,133
Confused, right?

416
00:25:09,401 --> 00:25:10,440
I'm dead.

417
00:25:10,685 --> 00:25:13,429
So just keep on doing
what you were doing.

418
00:25:13,534 --> 00:25:15,423
Pretend I'm not even here.

419
00:25:16,235 --> 00:25:17,174
Or am I?

420
00:25:21,949 --> 00:25:23,992
Seeing is believing,
isn't it?

421
00:26:00,969 --> 00:26:03,084
I know how difficult
it is for you,

422
00:26:04,191 --> 00:26:06,701
but you have
to see the wonder in it, jane.

423
00:26:06,783 --> 00:26:10,421
What if there was a way someday
to use it to help others

424
00:26:10,491 --> 00:26:13,421
cancer patients,
terminally ill children.

425
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:14,915
My team...

426
00:26:18,277 --> 00:26:20,411
They were good people,
simon.

427
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:21,917
I know you don't
think so...

428
00:26:21,998 --> 00:26:23,434
I never said that...

429
00:26:25,722 --> 00:26:28,290
The world needs to
know about them too.

430
00:26:29,764 --> 00:26:30,955
And so do you.

431
00:26:39,647 --> 00:26:41,731
The government spent
a lot of money traing me

432
00:26:41,807 --> 00:26:43,651
I'm very good at what I do.

433
00:26:43,709 --> 00:26:45,328
I can approach
a man from 100 metres

434
00:26:45,425 --> 00:26:46,511
and he'll never
hear me coming.

435
00:26:46,581 --> 00:26:47,527
You okay?

436
00:26:48,717 --> 00:26:51,110
My boots are worse than my ears.

437
00:26:56,168 --> 00:26:57,440
Hand me that gun!

438
00:27:00,016 --> 00:27:00,930
Slowly!!!

439
00:27:04,763 --> 00:27:06,526
Against the fence with her.

440
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:09,829
You're dead before
your hand hit the knob.

441
00:27:09,888 --> 00:27:11,440
I'm a federal officer...

442
00:27:14,641 --> 00:27:18,809
Alright pal, let's see how much
of risk you're willing to take.

443
00:27:19,007 --> 00:27:20,489
You found the neuro?

444
00:27:20,688 --> 00:27:22,275
Yeah, I'm with him
right now.

445
00:27:22,334 --> 00:27:23,641
Good work, riley.

446
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:29,724
I'm in...

447
00:27:30,716 --> 00:27:31,817
I'm on...

448
00:27:37,265 --> 00:27:38,291
And I am...

449
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,353
The best!!

450
00:27:40,801 --> 00:27:41,644
Crap !

451
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,451
There was no answer
when I knocked.

452
00:27:43,512 --> 00:27:45,519
I thought I heard some noises so
I thought there might be

453
00:27:45,566 --> 00:27:46,757
something wrong in here so...

454
00:27:46,803 --> 00:27:47,597
So you picked the lock?!

455
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:48,963
Yeah, it wasn't
all that difficult.

456
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:50,599
What are you doing
here, riley?

457
00:27:50,682 --> 00:27:53,110
Who the heck goes in
the basement alone?

458
00:27:55,899 --> 00:27:56,833
Mummy!!!!

459
00:27:59,725 --> 00:28:00,810
Nice hardware.

460
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,024
Damn right.

461
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,441
Oh, you mean the bike.

462
00:28:07,989 --> 00:28:10,324
Can you live with
yourself now!!!

463
00:28:14,547 --> 00:28:17,232
Yeah, I can live
with myself.

464
00:28:23,583 --> 00:28:25,757
Case closed you son of a bitch!

465
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:28,605
Football,
the name of my game.

466
00:28:29,527 --> 00:28:30,368
You play?

467
00:28:30,426 --> 00:28:32,166
She's talking
about the players.

468
00:28:33,225 --> 00:28:34,404
You take the ugly one.

469
00:28:34,451 --> 00:28:35,233
Wait!!

470
00:28:36,155 --> 00:28:37,602
D.E.A. Hands up!!!!

471
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:49,362
If I could
get my pen to work,

472
00:28:49,443 --> 00:28:52,759
you would think the mayor's
office had a pen that worked.

473
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:53,766
Hold it!

474
00:28:55,179 --> 00:28:57,081
I wouldn't
do that if I were you, sheriff.

475
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,287
Just put it down.

476
00:29:00,863 --> 00:29:02,743
This might change your mind.

477
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:15,649
But I..

478
00:29:17,892 --> 00:29:19,339
I chipped him.

479
00:29:22,865 --> 00:29:24,548
How often...

480
00:29:25,237 --> 00:29:27,245
do you trust your life...

481
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:29,136
to a friend.

482
00:29:30,233 --> 00:29:33,780
I trusted my life
to maureen every day.

483
00:29:34,282 --> 00:29:37,013
And when she died
she was part of a team,

484
00:29:37,096 --> 00:29:38,612
that had her back too.

485
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:41,122
We did our best.

486
00:29:41,598 --> 00:29:42,570
All of us.

487
00:29:44,052 --> 00:29:45,261
She knew that.

488
00:29:46,662 --> 00:29:47,841
We'll miss her.

489
00:29:48,848 --> 00:29:50,456
I'll really miss her.

490
00:30:01,724 --> 00:30:03,405
What the hell
is going on, Brian?!!!!

491
00:30:03,476 --> 00:30:05,051
I can't explain right now.

492
00:30:05,098 --> 00:30:07,185
Meet me on
the subway platform.

493
00:30:07,546 --> 00:30:08,270
Which one?

494
00:30:08,352 --> 00:30:10,663
You know what I'm
talking about, jane.

495
00:30:10,978 --> 00:30:13,220
There's a lot of weird
stuff happening.

496
00:30:13,336 --> 00:30:14,153
Really?

497
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:16,079
Just trust me.

498
00:30:16,722 --> 00:30:17,641
Please.

499
00:30:27,447 --> 00:30:28,649
That was Brian.

500
00:30:29,034 --> 00:30:30,890
He wants me to meet
him at the subway.

501
00:30:30,937 --> 00:30:33,470
He's not supposed to know
about the subway.

502
00:30:33,949 --> 00:30:37,273
Then again he wasn't supposed
to married with children

503
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,514
and living in
my apartment either.

504
00:30:41,417 --> 00:30:42,841
Can you trust him?

505
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:45,304
I don't know.

506
00:30:46,952 --> 00:30:49,076
We had a good relationship,

507
00:30:50,745 --> 00:30:51,948
I thought...

508
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,423
Show me.

509
00:31:02,419 --> 00:31:04,609
I'm a grown woman,
I can take it,

510
00:31:05,174 --> 00:31:07,698
So go on, hit me
with your best shot.

511
00:31:29,547 --> 00:31:30,539
Come on!!

512
00:31:46,585 --> 00:31:47,385
Duty calls.

513
00:31:47,945 --> 00:31:49,372
Something like that.

514
00:31:49,652 --> 00:31:51,905
I promise I'll
make it up to you.

515
00:31:52,734 --> 00:31:54,543
That I'm looking forward to.

516
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,497
Bri, what are you
doing here?

517
00:32:20,322 --> 00:32:22,650
You wanna try that again
but this time with,

518
00:32:22,708 --> 00:32:24,273
"bri, hey, this is great.

519
00:32:24,512 --> 00:32:25,883
"I thought you
were out of town.

520
00:32:25,907 --> 00:32:28,685
"I'm so happy that you
came back a day early

521
00:32:28,883 --> 00:32:30,203
"just to see me."

522
00:32:35,558 --> 00:32:37,365
I don't know
what to think.

523
00:32:37,435 --> 00:32:39,977
But you are thinking
of going to meet him.

524
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,821
It's hard not to let our
emotional attachments

525
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:45,023
cloud our judgments.

526
00:32:45,127 --> 00:32:46,678
But what are my options?

527
00:32:47,226 --> 00:32:49,698
To go on the run, live
in hiding forever?

528
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:51,039
No offense.

529
00:32:51,109 --> 00:32:53,079
But I want
to know the truth.

530
00:32:54,968 --> 00:32:57,569
I tried running
away before,

531
00:32:57,616 --> 00:32:59,377
to escape the inevitable...

532
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,604
It didn't work.

533
00:33:08,075 --> 00:33:09,276
Agent vasco.

534
00:33:09,556 --> 00:33:11,888
I'm not even sure
who you are an agent with,

535
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:13,521
but I know in three days,

536
00:33:14,046 --> 00:33:16,940
you and your team
will try to arrest me.

537
00:33:17,045 --> 00:33:18,678
It won't go well.

538
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:20,683
Your three teammates
will be killed.

539
00:33:20,753 --> 00:33:22,188
And then you'll shoot me.

540
00:33:22,235 --> 00:33:24,181
I die in front of
the orange door.

541
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:25,440
You're afraid
to go after this guy.

542
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,037
You're the ones
that should be afraid

543
00:33:27,085 --> 00:33:28,938
according to him,
I make it out of this.

544
00:33:29,008 --> 00:33:30,513
Maybe we don't
have a choice.

545
00:33:30,629 --> 00:33:32,273
Haven't his experiences
and ours

546
00:33:32,378 --> 00:33:33,920
proven we can't
change the outcome.

547
00:33:33,953 --> 00:33:35,760
Nobody controls
my destiny but me.

548
00:33:35,842 --> 00:33:36,670
Agent vasco?

549
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,672
Ethan,
where are you?

550
00:33:38,987 --> 00:33:40,340
I knew you'd come here.

551
00:33:40,386 --> 00:33:41,529
I saw it.

552
00:33:42,451 --> 00:33:43,617
I believe you.

553
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:46,888
And I believe your premonition
about me and my team.

554
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:49,080
How do I stop it?

555
00:33:50,864 --> 00:33:51,984
I'm sorry.

556
00:33:57,639 --> 00:33:59,670
Just stopped by Jane's
place there's some clothes

557
00:33:59,725 --> 00:34:00,751
and a suitcase missing.

558
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:02,897
But she left
her locator behind.

559
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:06,421
Will somebody please tell me
what the hell is going on here?!

560
00:34:06,493 --> 00:34:08,455
Jane is still trying
to change the future

561
00:34:08,487 --> 00:34:09,490
ethan grant predicted.

562
00:34:09,571 --> 00:34:10,679
By leaving town!!!!

563
00:34:10,738 --> 00:34:12,020
Right now she's probably
trying to get

564
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:13,816
as far away from ethan grant,

565
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:15,542
the tosrona factory
and us as possible.

566
00:34:15,577 --> 00:34:16,075
Without her,

567
00:34:16,135 --> 00:34:19,426
the premonition can't
play out the way he saw it.

568
00:34:21,884 --> 00:34:25,605
Alright, I saw movement
in the north-west corner.

569
00:34:25,675 --> 00:34:26,596
So this is going down.

570
00:34:26,666 --> 00:34:28,964
It won't be what he predicted
without vasco.

571
00:34:29,034 --> 00:34:30,258
Let's find out.

572
00:34:37,348 --> 00:34:40,124
Bowers, why don't you
lay down some fire!!

573
00:34:57,277 --> 00:35:00,215
Don't worry andre, I'm going
to get you out of here.

574
00:35:00,285 --> 00:35:01,440
How bad is it?

575
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,195
What the?!

576
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,701
That one really hurt!

577
00:35:08,785 --> 00:35:10,083
But I saw andre die.

578
00:35:10,153 --> 00:35:12,392
I drugged connor and andre.

579
00:35:13,441 --> 00:35:14,806
Don't you understand!

580
00:35:14,876 --> 00:35:16,637
I died in their place!

581
00:35:16,718 --> 00:35:18,284
You trying to fake
out fate, jane!!

582
00:35:18,334 --> 00:35:19,722
Who says it's a fake out?

583
00:35:19,792 --> 00:35:21,973
Maybe this is exactly
what ethan saw.

584
00:35:22,066 --> 00:35:25,564
He interpreted it as seeing
three different people die.

585
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:40,964
But I saw my own death.

586
00:35:41,535 --> 00:35:43,984
You shouldn't believe
everything you see.

587
00:35:53,072 --> 00:35:53,959
Come on.

588
00:36:00,328 --> 00:36:01,401
Watch out!

589
00:36:02,008 --> 00:36:03,512
You can't stop fate,

590
00:36:03,559 --> 00:36:04,538
no one can.

591
00:36:05,241 --> 00:36:06,882
It's like a living thing,

592
00:36:07,186 --> 00:36:09,238
it swallows us
all into darkness.

593
00:36:15,116 --> 00:36:18,730
No matter what happens,
I promise,

594
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,515
you're story will be told.

595
00:36:22,338 --> 00:36:23,341
Thank you.

596
00:36:44,694 --> 00:36:46,019
whatever they did,

597
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:50,637
whatever they threatened
you with, I understand.

598
00:36:52,008 --> 00:36:54,344
I just want you
to be okay.

599
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,220
Brian?

600
00:37:29,561 --> 00:37:31,322
Do exactly as I tell you.

601
00:37:32,009 --> 00:37:33,911
You won't heal
from this,

602
00:37:34,354 --> 00:37:35,322
trust me.

603
00:37:36,241 --> 00:37:37,640
Why Brian?

604
00:37:37,897 --> 00:37:38,771
Quiet.

605
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,658
Just please tell me,

606
00:37:44,886 --> 00:37:47,047
is someone making you
to do this?

607
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:48,899
Was it always a lie?

608
00:38:10,856 --> 00:38:12,136
Jane, are you alright?

609
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:13,792
What the hell
is happening?

610
00:38:13,862 --> 00:38:15,424
You're fine, you're fine.
Look at me !

611
00:38:15,436 --> 00:38:16,696
I was administering
some tests.

612
00:38:16,766 --> 00:38:18,230
I had to sedate you.

613
00:38:19,898 --> 00:38:21,601
How long have I been out?

614
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:23,245
A couple of hours.

615
00:38:23,432 --> 00:38:25,962
The anesthesia I gave you should
have kept you out for longer.

616
00:38:26,044 --> 00:38:27,816
Are you sure
you're alright?

617
00:38:27,851 --> 00:38:29,580
Yeah, yeah I just
need to get up.

618
00:38:29,638 --> 00:38:30,559
Alright.

619
00:38:34,851 --> 00:38:35,667
This is interesting.

620
00:38:35,737 --> 00:38:37,103
Check this out.

621
00:38:37,161 --> 00:38:38,992
She's down by the pier
and she jumped off,

622
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,380
nobody saw her surface.

623
00:38:40,415 --> 00:38:42,351
She was down at the aqueduct,

624
00:38:42,421 --> 00:38:43,342
and she just...

625
00:38:44,777 --> 00:38:45,932
Disappeared.

626
00:38:45,979 --> 00:38:47,821
We've got some
kind of fish neuro

627
00:38:47,879 --> 00:38:49,092
that can breathe underwater?

628
00:38:49,151 --> 00:38:50,572
Time to get out
your scuba gear.

629
00:38:50,643 --> 00:38:52,917
And I will rig up
a chip spear-gun...

630
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,025
Well!

631
00:38:54,643 --> 00:38:56,504
Sleeping beauty awakes.

632
00:38:56,574 --> 00:38:59,222
And I didn't even get
the chance to kiss her.

633
00:39:02,848 --> 00:39:04,318
What, no frog jokes?

634
00:39:07,631 --> 00:39:11,351
You're all alive, right?

635
00:39:20,076 --> 00:39:22,910
I never thought I'd be so
happy to feel your body...

636
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:25,487
Well, if you like
it that much,

637
00:39:25,534 --> 00:39:29,428
I'll have you jumping up
and down for joy later on.

638
00:39:31,518 --> 00:39:36,007
...Or hear your
stupid sexist jokes.

639
00:39:36,951 --> 00:39:39,611
Whoa, what did frankenseth
do to you in there?

640
00:39:43,241 --> 00:39:44,922
Jane, are you okay?

641
00:39:47,137 --> 00:39:47,861
Yeah.

642
00:39:58,475 --> 00:40:01,067
I guess I don't know.

643
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:04,860
I think you need to go home,

644
00:40:05,665 --> 00:40:07,369
pull yourself together.

645
00:40:09,563 --> 00:40:10,374
Okay.

646
00:40:13,848 --> 00:40:19,342
I think going home's a really
good idea for me right now.

647
00:40:26,859 --> 00:40:29,473
Warned you about
hiring women, boss.

648
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:27,640
Well,
nice to see you, too.

649
00:41:30,745 --> 00:41:34,687
We were supposed to meet
for dinner tonight, right?

650
00:41:47,507 --> 00:41:49,127
I suppose I will have
to start thinking

651
00:41:49,216 --> 00:41:52,356
about making the next
generation a reality some day.

652
00:41:53,253 --> 00:41:55,518
Right now,
I just want to practice.

653
00:41:56,371 --> 00:41:57,246
A lot.

654
00:42:26,383 --> 00:42:28,893
Daddy, who's she?

655
00:42:29,396 --> 00:42:30,668
We need to talk.

656
00:42:37,083 --> 00:42:39,282
There's another girl
in my life,

657
00:42:40,707 --> 00:42:41,885
my niece,

658
00:42:44,149 --> 00:42:46,519
seven years old
and adorable.

659
00:42:47,332 --> 00:42:49,739
Must have dropped
that in my briefcase.

660
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:52,249
I hope you can handle
the competition.
