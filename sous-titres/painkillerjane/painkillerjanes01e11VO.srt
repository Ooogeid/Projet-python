00:00:00,714 --> 00:00:02,064
My name is jane vasco.

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:03,550
I could use you on my team.

3
00:00:03,646 --> 00:00:06,945
I work for a secret government
agency that hunts neuros.

4
00:00:07,071 --> 00:00:10,389
People who can do dangerous
things with their minds.

5
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:12,561
On my first assignment...

6
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:14,587
Something a little weird happened,

7
00:00:15,074 --> 00:00:17,640
okay, something really weird.

8
00:00:18,536 --> 00:00:21,343
Until i get some answers
i'm getting on with my life,

9
00:00:21,698 --> 00:00:22,696
doing my job.

10
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:24,648
Stocking up on aspirin,

11
00:00:25,265 --> 00:00:27,464
because let me tell ya,

12
00:00:28,667 --> 00:00:29,690
pain's a bitch !

13
00:00:33,957 --> 00:00:36,319
When you spend a lot of time
with the people you work with,

14
00:00:36,839 --> 00:00:38,228
you get to know them well,

15
00:00:39,194 --> 00:00:40,834
even if you
have never been to their homes,

16
00:00:40,888 --> 00:00:43,570
you can imagine how they live.

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,441
When i visited andre, his
place was clean, organized.

18
00:00:48,973 --> 00:00:50,979
And i guess you can say, manly.

19
00:00:51,798 --> 00:00:54,384
Except for the box of
captain crunch in his kitchen.

20
00:00:55,179 --> 00:00:58,671
He claims it's for when his niece visits.
Sure.

21
00:00:59,686 --> 00:01:01,423
Been to mo's place lots of times,

22
00:01:01,963 --> 00:01:03,255
the surroundings fit the woman.

23
00:01:06,253 --> 00:01:07,835
Haven't seen riley's pad

24
00:01:07,941 --> 00:01:11,144
but i can imagine stacks of comic books,

25
00:01:11,608 --> 00:01:14,116
tech gear and sci fi memorabilia.

26
00:01:17,705 --> 00:01:18,650
As for connor,

27
00:01:19,906 --> 00:01:24,276
let's just say, i plan to wash
my hands for a long time

28
00:01:25,078 --> 00:01:29,284
with really hot water and
industrial soap after i leave.

29
00:01:44,461 --> 00:01:44,924
Vasco.

30
00:01:46,007 --> 00:01:46,913
Nice hardware.

31
00:01:47,722 --> 00:01:48,300
Damn right.

32
00:01:49,584 --> 00:01:50,491
Oh, you mean the bike.

33
00:01:51,533 --> 00:01:52,309
What're you doing here ?

34
00:01:52,401 --> 00:01:53,328
Got a lead on the kids.

35
00:01:53,657 --> 00:01:55,741
Riley's been trying to get
you on the comm all morning.

36
00:01:55,868 --> 00:01:57,371
And you volunteered
to come by personally.

37
00:01:57,817 --> 00:01:58,686
We drew straws.

38
00:01:59,337 --> 00:01:59,974
I lost.

39
00:02:00,379 --> 00:02:01,325
Briefing's at 1400 hours.

40
00:02:01,702 --> 00:02:02,744
That's two hours from now.

41
00:02:03,705 --> 00:02:05,056
A lot can happen in two hours.

42
00:02:05,603 --> 00:02:06,510
You're being modest.

43
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:08,732
I'm sure you could get the job
done in two minutes.

44
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:10,529
Two minutes.

45
00:02:11,954 --> 00:02:13,671
Just enough time for me
to torque down these heads.

46
00:02:17,658 --> 00:02:19,895
Maybe you shouldn't be
playing with sharp instruments.

47
00:02:20,895 --> 00:02:21,686
Just a burn.

48
00:02:22,438 --> 00:02:23,923
Coffee maker blew a gasket on me.

49
00:02:26,061 --> 00:02:27,816
It's more organized than
i thought it would be.

50
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,724
You expected a scattered mess.

51
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,651
Something like that.

52
00:02:32,045 --> 00:02:33,048
Not me.

53
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:34,320
Works chaotic enough.

54
00:02:34,575 --> 00:02:35,906
Gotta come home to Ssomething different.

55
00:02:38,615 --> 00:02:39,619
Yeah, i know.

56
00:02:57,922 --> 00:02:58,944
Thanks.

57
00:02:59,106 --> 00:03:01,035
Maybe you should play
with toy boats instead.

58
00:03:01,553 --> 00:03:02,556
Hell, that was close.

59
00:03:04,211 --> 00:03:05,812
Must've made contact with the terminals.

60
00:03:06,292 --> 00:03:07,303
Must have.

61
00:03:07,412 --> 00:03:09,703
In the future it may be a good idea

62
00:03:09,753 --> 00:03:10,756
to disengage the gears

63
00:03:10,801 --> 00:03:11,939
before you get under the bike.

64
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,081
I always do.

65
00:03:15,499 --> 00:03:16,502
Almost always.

66
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:24,475
Mcbride.

67
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:26,724
Car's out front.

Presync : Akazab & Sixe

69
00:03:58,082 --> 00:04:00,764
Chinese tradition puts
a lot of stock in names.

70
00:04:01,685 --> 00:04:03,518
They believe you can make your destiny

71
00:04:03,637 --> 00:04:05,489
by what you call yourself.

72
00:04:06,744 --> 00:04:08,113
"Joyful fortune."

73
00:04:09,296 --> 00:04:12,826
whoever chose that name was
hoping for not just success,

74
00:04:13,899 --> 00:04:14,960
but pleasure in it.

75
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,521
I wonder if they got either.

76
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:23,287
Let's focus.

77
00:04:23,335 --> 00:04:24,615
These may be kids, but they're killers.

78
00:04:24,661 --> 00:04:26,146
And until we know which one's the neuro,

79
00:04:26,215 --> 00:04:27,219
they are all deadly.

80
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,330
Riley, talk to me.

81
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,277
) Triangulation puts our
boys in the loading bay.

82
00:05:07,567 --> 00:05:08,609
Can you hear me ?

83
00:05:17,637 --> 00:05:19,639
Guys, can you hear me?
Andre, what's going on ?

84
00:05:58,434 --> 00:05:59,505
Chip him !

85
00:06:00,156 --> 00:06:01,063
Chip him !

86
00:06:01,138 --> 00:06:02,141
Which one ?

87
00:06:07,273 --> 00:06:08,682
The window isn't broken !

88
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:11,381
It's the one furthest from the window !

89
00:06:19,468 --> 00:06:20,471
Come on !!!!

90
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:24,998
Okay, guys, i'm back.

91
00:06:25,462 --> 00:06:26,523
Is everythings okay ?

92
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,702
Yeah, we're alright.

93
00:06:28,015 --> 00:06:29,170
Let seth know we're coming in.

94
00:06:29,204 --> 00:06:30,825
We're going to need some looking over.

95
00:06:33,555 --> 00:06:34,559
I'm on, boss.

96
00:06:37,658 --> 00:06:38,738
What the hell was that ?

97
00:06:39,847 --> 00:06:41,680
Ultra-sonics would be my guess.

98
00:06:43,032 --> 00:06:44,653
Only that one kid was the neuro.

99
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:46,672
Yeah, it was more than enough.

100
00:06:56,584 --> 00:06:57,587
You okay ?

101
00:06:57,731 --> 00:06:58,734
Yeah.

102
00:06:58,906 --> 00:07:00,256
My boot's worse than my ears.

103
00:07:14,785 --> 00:07:16,483
Thanks for patching me up, doc.

104
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:17,506
I appreciate it.

105
00:07:17,697 --> 00:07:18,739
That's what i'm here for.

106
00:07:19,192 --> 00:07:21,083
Come to the hospital for better xrays,

107
00:07:21,084 --> 00:07:22,107
i'll set you up with some painkillers.

108
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:23,736
I think, I'll be fine.

109
00:07:24,438 --> 00:07:25,480
Of course you will.

110
00:07:26,272 --> 00:07:28,433
That should hold you
until the bone heals.

111
00:07:29,104 --> 00:07:30,126
Try to stay off it.

112
00:07:36,141 --> 00:07:37,241
Not your day, is it ?

113
00:07:38,753 --> 00:07:41,029
The burn, the bike, now your foot...

114
00:07:41,179 --> 00:07:42,202
I'm bucking the odds.

115
00:07:42,876 --> 00:07:44,226
Maybe i'll buy a lottery ticket.

116
00:07:44,724 --> 00:07:46,364
You think there could
be another explanation ?

117
00:07:46,593 --> 00:07:47,307
Yeah.

118
00:07:47,353 --> 00:07:48,742
Bad day, crap happens.

119
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:49,832
That's life.

120
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:52,322
Since you're so concerned,

121
00:07:53,332 --> 00:07:55,434
maybe you'd be interested
in turning my luck around.

122
00:07:58,201 --> 00:08:00,343
I think maybe you should be
more concerned than i am.

123
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:26,893
You're still here.

124
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,177
Something on your mind.

125
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:29,648
You believe in coincidence ?

126
00:08:29,703 --> 00:08:31,381
I believe in getting
straight to the point.

127
00:08:31,474 --> 00:08:32,497
Connor.

128
00:08:33,258 --> 00:08:34,705
There's a lot i don't know about him.

129
00:08:34,859 --> 00:08:35,901
That's true.

130
00:08:36,544 --> 00:08:38,145
And that's not a coincidence.

131
00:08:38,456 --> 00:08:40,499
You know more about his
past than anyone on the team.

132
00:08:40,745 --> 00:08:42,536
I know what i need to know.

133
00:08:43,442 --> 00:08:44,869
And you know what you need to know.

134
00:08:45,143 --> 00:08:47,150
Did you know that he had
three "accidents" today.

135
00:08:47,546 --> 00:08:49,244
A coffee machine blew
up in his face...

136
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,531
His bike almost
took his leg off...

137
00:08:51,619 --> 00:08:53,008
And the door.

138
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:56,838
If something or someone from
his past has resurfaced...

139
00:08:57,176 --> 00:08:59,163
If all of what's happened
isn't a coincidence...

140
00:08:59,464 --> 00:09:00,892
Then the whole team
could be in jeopardy.

141
00:09:02,547 --> 00:09:04,167
Look, i don't know
what's going on here.

142
00:09:04,727 --> 00:09:05,750
I just don't feel comfortable

143
00:09:05,797 --> 00:09:08,942
waiting for the next thing just happenned.

144
00:09:09,247 --> 00:09:12,083
So i'm supposed to act
based on your feelings ?

145
00:09:12,467 --> 00:09:13,470
No.

146
00:09:14,325 --> 00:09:15,347
On yours.

147
00:09:28,661 --> 00:09:30,706
You're not taking this seriously ?

148
00:09:31,141 --> 00:09:32,858
I have to,Connor, it's my job.

149
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:36,110
Tell vasco to stick to
what she does best...

150
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:37,827
Remaing invulnerable to injuries

151
00:09:37,846 --> 00:09:39,332
and everyone around her.

152
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,056
Sounds like you take it personally.

153
00:09:43,189 --> 00:09:45,176
After today we should be
drinking, not thinking.

154
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:46,719
So tell me...

155
00:09:47,343 --> 00:09:49,801
What is it you're trying
to avoid thinking about ?

156
00:09:50,306 --> 00:09:51,698
A guy can't just have
a drink with a friend ?

157
00:09:52,322 --> 00:09:53,653
It's your timing that concerns me.

158
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,654
See, i don't think it's a coincidence.

159
00:09:55,655 --> 00:09:56,650
Here we go.

160
00:09:56,704 --> 00:09:58,421
We made a deal when
i brought you aboard.

161
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,200
You'd tell me everything i need to know.

162
00:10:00,287 --> 00:10:01,580
I made good on that.

163
00:10:01,863 --> 00:10:03,117
As far as you know, you have.

164
00:10:03,211 --> 00:10:05,025
I had riley check the specs on that door

165
00:10:05,468 --> 00:10:06,490
it's right up to code,

166
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,445
redundant safeties.

167
00:10:07,576 --> 00:10:08,965
No way that thing could
have been blown

168
00:10:09,007 --> 00:10:10,400
unless someone tampered with it.

169
00:10:10,536 --> 00:10:12,327
Now you're sounding like vasco.

170
00:10:13,087 --> 00:10:14,187
Too bad there's not enough of this

171
00:10:14,255 --> 00:10:15,258
to make you look like her.

172
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:16,280
Just talk to me.

173
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,411
If there's something,
anything in your past;

174
00:10:19,436 --> 00:10:22,472
any unfinished business,
whatever it is, i need to know.

175
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,700
Even if there was...

176
00:10:24,084 --> 00:10:25,084
What are we talking about here ?

177
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,400
I meant, there was
nobody in the garage

178
00:10:26,462 --> 00:10:27,696
when the trannie slipped into gear.

179
00:10:28,613 --> 00:10:30,388
And besides us and
the freak boys' quad,

180
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,728
there was no one else at that warehouse.

181
00:10:32,422 --> 00:10:33,636
I've got a closet fulla skeletons,

182
00:10:33,704 --> 00:10:34,665
we both know that.

183
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:36,157
But they're dead skeletons, boss.

184
00:10:36,158 --> 00:10:38,617
They aren't comin' back to
life to haunt my coffee maker.

185
00:10:39,276 --> 00:10:41,225
Drink this, you're making me nervous.

186
00:11:23,963 --> 00:11:25,641
I don't know what we're
supposed to be looking for here.

187
00:11:26,678 --> 00:11:27,971
For all i know, jane is making a big

188
00:11:28,011 --> 00:11:29,014
deal from nothing.

189
00:11:51,827 --> 00:11:52,830
Hello ?

190
00:12:18,921 --> 00:12:20,117
Somebody here ?

191
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:22,402
Anybody ?

192
00:12:32,637 --> 00:12:33,698
Is anybody here ?

193
00:13:32,568 --> 00:13:33,590
You waiting for these ?

194
00:13:34,662 --> 00:13:35,665
Oh yeah, right.

195
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,744
There's no gear here for
the part of my body

196
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,295
that i like to exercise.

197
00:13:43,161 --> 00:13:44,473
You might want to reconsider that.

198
00:13:44,726 --> 00:13:45,825
Why? I look out of shape to you ?

199
00:13:47,721 --> 00:13:48,917
What's on your mind, riley ?

200
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:50,524
Oh, maybe staying awake all night,

201
00:13:50,572 --> 00:13:53,060
working up a full history
profile on connor.

202
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,400
Yeah, that sounds like a great time.

203
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,503
It wasn't.

204
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:58,009
Andre said it was your idea.

205
00:13:58,975 --> 00:14:00,615
Something about you having
a hunch that something

206
00:14:00,627 --> 00:14:02,634
from connor's past might
be reaching out to...

207
00:14:03,881 --> 00:14:04,884
Touch him.

208
00:14:05,248 --> 00:14:06,154
Oh, yeah.

209
00:14:06,155 --> 00:14:06,845
I guess it was.

210
00:14:06,904 --> 00:14:08,003
A hunch ?

211
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,303
An educated guess.

212
00:14:09,359 --> 00:14:10,883
No, a hunch !

213
00:14:11,307 --> 00:14:14,046
With no data to confirm
the facts it's a hunch!

214
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:15,868
They've paid off in the past.

215
00:14:16,134 --> 00:14:17,524
You telling me you've never had a hunch ?

216
00:14:17,592 --> 00:14:18,556
No, i haven't !

217
00:14:18,703 --> 00:14:21,723
And i've never seen a ghost,
been abducted by aliens,

218
00:14:21,753 --> 00:14:23,490
found the truth
of my life in astrology,

219
00:14:23,554 --> 00:14:26,023
You know what, I been granted
three wishes by a genie...

220
00:14:27,406 --> 00:14:28,814
By the sounds of your "enthusiasm",

221
00:14:29,116 --> 00:14:30,235
my hunch paid off.

222
00:14:30,507 --> 00:14:32,282
Yes, maybe but that's not the point.

223
00:14:32,685 --> 00:14:34,672
I think it is.

224
00:14:36,099 --> 00:14:37,912
Learn to live with it, ri.

225
00:14:39,673 --> 00:14:41,137
By the way, what is your sign ?

226
00:14:41,395 --> 00:14:42,572
Easy.

227
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,900
Yeah, you love it.

228
00:14:46,212 --> 00:14:48,103
My sign...

229
00:14:50,455 --> 00:14:52,693
Barrier precinct
tactical response squad.

230
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,335
This photo was taken twelve years ago.

231
00:14:58,095 --> 00:14:59,636
What the hell's this all about ?

232
00:15:00,276 --> 00:15:01,317
You authorized this ?

233
00:15:02,331 --> 00:15:04,481
Connor, five of these men
are now dead.

234
00:15:04,547 --> 00:15:07,480
Davis monfredo was driving
a combine on his father's farm

235
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,599
and got caught in the gears.

236
00:15:08,789 --> 00:15:10,333
Sucked him in up to his waist

237
00:15:10,334 --> 00:15:11,567
before they got it shut off.

238
00:15:11,866 --> 00:15:14,104
Kevin douglas, pinned between a forklift

239
00:15:14,224 --> 00:15:16,724
and a loading dock, crushing his pelvis.

240
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:20,130
Gottschalk and rubin,
both died in car accidents.

241
00:15:20,901 --> 00:15:23,076
Taken separately, maybe accidental.

242
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:25,200
But put them all together...

243
00:15:25,298 --> 00:15:27,710
And we're looking for
is a man who knows how to beat

244
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,748
the safeties on an industrial fire door.

245
00:15:30,243 --> 00:15:31,914
And on a vintage motocylce.

246
00:15:32,367 --> 00:15:34,028
Last one was joey berlin,

247
00:15:34,837 --> 00:15:35,937
got mangled by a generator.

248
00:15:36,005 --> 00:15:38,108
Last night at bassetts department store.

249
00:15:38,782 --> 00:15:40,352
Eleven miles from here.

250
00:15:41,576 --> 00:15:42,579
Connor...

251
00:15:42,597 --> 00:15:44,063
Can you make a call on this ?

252
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,014
Relax, they're coming.

253
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:11,826
You know, when you get out of prison,

254
00:16:13,294 --> 00:16:18,889
you think "i did it, did my time."

255
00:16:20,169 --> 00:16:22,154
pull enough crap in your life,

256
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,516
you never stop doing time.

257
00:16:25,093 --> 00:16:26,853
You have any idea what this is about ?

258
00:16:27,191 --> 00:16:29,294
I haven't seen any of
those guys in ten years.

259
00:16:29,398 --> 00:16:31,338
Did any of these guys
do time with you ?

260
00:16:31,468 --> 00:16:32,530
Hell, no.

261
00:16:33,294 --> 00:16:34,577
They were the pride of the precinct,

262
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:35,366
the dream team,

263
00:16:35,404 --> 00:16:36,683
immaculate, untouchable.

264
00:16:37,715 --> 00:16:38,738
Untouchable ?

265
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,386
Well, someone's trying
to get back in touch with you.

266
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:44,337
- Who'd have a reason ?
- We put away a lot of creeps.

267
00:16:44,443 --> 00:16:45,249
You want a list ?

268
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,254
Some of those...

269
00:16:47,704 --> 00:16:48,727
Thank you.

270
00:16:49,396 --> 00:16:51,887
Some of those guys you
put away were wearing blue.

271
00:16:53,473 --> 00:16:54,534
I told you,

272
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,917
not on this team !

273
00:16:55,959 --> 00:16:57,047
Hey !!

274
00:16:57,355 --> 00:16:58,261
Hey, go easy.

275
00:16:58,776 --> 00:16:59,837
None of this is easy.

276
00:17:00,064 --> 00:17:02,031
Are you sure you're
not painting these guys

277
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:04,366
a brighter shade of white
just because you want to ?

278
00:17:04,403 --> 00:17:06,641
I know who i am and what i've done.

279
00:17:07,302 --> 00:17:09,171
I don't need to color reality.

280
00:17:10,055 --> 00:17:11,058
I noticed.

281
00:17:11,777 --> 00:17:12,799
Here's the deal, connor.

282
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:15,881
Right now, you're at risk,

283
00:17:15,923 --> 00:17:17,872
and you're putting the whole team at risk.

284
00:17:17,873 --> 00:17:18,780
What do you want I should do ?

285
00:17:18,781 --> 00:17:19,674
Crawl into a hole ?

286
00:17:19,675 --> 00:17:20,687
Close enough.

287
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:22,943
Until this is over, you lie low,

288
00:17:22,955 --> 00:17:23,730
you go underground.

289
00:17:23,731 --> 00:17:24,851
And if it takes weeks ?

290
00:17:25,255 --> 00:17:28,155
If it takes weeks, i'll buy
you another bottle of reality.

291
00:17:32,297 --> 00:17:33,389
Go easy.

292
00:17:39,257 --> 00:17:40,865
Wine waits for no man.

293
00:17:41,262 --> 00:17:42,448
Have you almost done ?

294
00:17:42,527 --> 00:17:44,687
I just have to double check
these last couple of quotes

295
00:17:44,871 --> 00:17:46,410
and ship it off to my editor.

296
00:17:48,747 --> 00:17:49,933
I'll get that for you.

297
00:17:54,005 --> 00:17:55,485
I didn't know you liked crosswords.

298
00:17:55,687 --> 00:17:57,672
Of should i say, "loved crosswords."

299
00:17:58,072 --> 00:18:00,104
i had some time to kill
in the laundry room yesterday.

300
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,610
You should do laundry more often.

301
00:18:01,646 --> 00:18:03,830
There's about three weeks
worth of dirty clothes here.

302
00:18:05,211 --> 00:18:06,327
It was a couple of hours.

303
00:18:08,694 --> 00:18:11,489
You did that whole stack of
crosswords in a couple of hours?

304
00:18:11,821 --> 00:18:12,795
In pen ?

305
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,680
Wow, i better watch my back around you.

306
00:18:16,918 --> 00:18:18,021
I'll watch yours.

307
00:18:21,292 --> 00:18:22,302
Something i said ?

308
00:18:22,365 --> 00:18:23,422
No.

309
00:18:23,749 --> 00:18:24,841
Maybe something i did.

310
00:18:26,783 --> 00:18:27,793
Those puzzles.

311
00:18:28,506 --> 00:18:29,645
No crime in being smart.

312
00:18:33,781 --> 00:18:37,180
I guess i'm a lot smarter
than i thought i was.

313
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,519
Obviously.

314
00:18:38,969 --> 00:18:39,967
You chose me.

315
00:18:41,197 --> 00:18:44,578
As i recall, you picked me.

316
00:18:45,287 --> 00:18:46,285
Really ?

317
00:18:46,346 --> 00:18:47,368
Yeah.

318
00:18:50,726 --> 00:18:51,971
Two smart people,
huh ?

319
00:18:53,534 --> 00:18:54,556
Think that'll work out ?

320
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,628
As long as the tie-breakers go to me.

321
00:19:00,753 --> 00:19:01,809
You know,

322
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,411
for a girl who likes to come
across as a tough guy,

323
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,923
you might want to hide
your bronte collection.

324
00:19:07,924 --> 00:19:09,235
It reveals the romantic in you.

325
00:19:09,257 --> 00:19:11,321
You've been snooping my bookshelves ?

326
00:19:11,553 --> 00:19:13,450
I'm a reporter. Occupational hazard.

327
00:19:13,703 --> 00:19:15,053
You going to write my story ?

328
00:19:17,292 --> 00:19:19,344
Or just get to know it.

329
00:19:19,902 --> 00:19:21,502
And i hope it's a very long one...

330
00:19:21,503 --> 00:19:22,871
With lots of installments.

331
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:30,082
Timing is everything.

332
00:19:31,562 --> 00:19:33,891
This better be extremely important.

333
00:19:34,493 --> 00:19:35,986
- Hello...
- Jane, it's andre.

334
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:37,666
I need you to get over to connor's.

335
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,705
I thought he was...

336
00:19:41,459 --> 00:19:42,597
"Out of town".

337
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,049
Yeah, he's laying low,

338
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,209
but he rembered some letters

339
00:19:45,399 --> 00:19:47,136
written from a couple of
guys on his squad.

340
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,609
They're a few years old,
but they might give us

341
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:49,759
some more personal insight

342
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,391
than what riley can bring up
on his computer.

343
00:19:51,749 --> 00:19:53,467
They're in a box in his garage.

344
00:19:53,468 --> 00:19:54,472
Right now ?

345
00:19:54,473 --> 00:19:55,989
Yes, right now, is there a problem ?

346
00:19:55,996 --> 00:19:57,713
No, it's fine.

347
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,075
Good, while you're there,
i want you to dig around

348
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:02,542
for anything else that
might be, relevant.

349
00:20:02,758 --> 00:20:05,575
Liste, none of us are perfect, jane.

350
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:07,037
That's definitely includes connor,

351
00:20:07,922 --> 00:20:09,801
he might be withholding
information

352
00:20:09,802 --> 00:20:12,221
that could jeopardize us all,
especially himself.

353
00:20:12,222 --> 00:20:13,275
I'll take care of it.

354
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,290
Good, call me when you're done.

355
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:16,462
Right.

356
00:20:18,538 --> 00:20:19,541
I've got to go.

357
00:20:21,392 --> 00:20:25,752
Will you promise to hold
that last thought ?

358
00:20:25,753 --> 00:20:27,291
It was more than a thought,

359
00:20:28,177 --> 00:20:34,187
but don't worry, it's not going
to change for quite some time.

360
00:22:17,823 --> 00:22:19,328
Nice to meet you too !!!

361
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:30,257
This would be a lot
easier if you tell

362
00:22:30,258 --> 00:22:31,296
me where king is.

363
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,675
Who the hell are you ?

364
00:22:34,555 --> 00:22:36,812
You are going to
find out right now !!

365
00:22:48,337 --> 00:22:51,501
I just wanna talk to him !

366
00:23:23,327 --> 00:23:26,819
He was tall, about 6 foot,
short hair, silver,

367
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,359
with a little bit of black on the sides.

368
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,974
Ring any bells ?

369
00:23:31,305 --> 00:23:33,717
About a million guys
playing the slots in vegas.

370
00:23:33,749 --> 00:23:35,138
This wasn't his
first fight.

371
00:23:35,421 --> 00:23:37,070
The guy knew what he was
doing with a knife.

372
00:23:37,108 --> 00:23:38,169
You got those photos ?

373
00:23:38,304 --> 00:23:41,218
I ran an aging program on the old photo.

374
00:23:42,466 --> 00:23:44,569
These are the surviving
members of connor's team.

375
00:23:44,687 --> 00:23:45,594
That's him !!

376
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:47,264
William hoyt pierce.

377
00:23:47,265 --> 00:23:48,282
Senior officer.

378
00:23:48,804 --> 00:23:50,251
We lost touch when i went upstate.

379
00:23:50,474 --> 00:23:51,979
Look like he's feeling nostalgic.

380
00:23:52,138 --> 00:23:53,611
Riley, current address ?

381
00:23:54,824 --> 00:23:56,348
The guy's law enforcement,

382
00:23:56,724 --> 00:23:58,672
he's always on the move,
no fixed address.

383
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:01,090
He's off the radar completely.

384
00:24:01,694 --> 00:24:03,064
You're saying you can't find him.

385
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:05,591
I never say never.

386
00:24:07,534 --> 00:24:10,698
Maybe we need
to let him find us.

387
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,845
Connor, we got you in sight.

388
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:29,532
Nothing arriving except one vehicle.

389
00:24:45,889 --> 00:24:46,892
There.

390
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,763
King !

391
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:31,583
Pierce was here and
never changed position.

392
00:25:31,836 --> 00:25:33,765
The truck made no course corrections.

393
00:25:34,514 --> 00:25:36,424
Pierce was the intended
target the whole time.

394
00:25:36,692 --> 00:25:37,676
He wasn't after you.

395
00:25:37,677 --> 00:25:38,685
He was trying to warn you.

396
00:25:38,709 --> 00:25:40,657
Or kill me because he
thought i was behind it.

397
00:25:40,814 --> 00:25:41,914
The truck shows no sign

398
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,047
- of mechanical tampering.
- And no one behind the wheel.

399
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:45,826
So we're looking for
a guy who can control

400
00:25:45,933 --> 00:25:47,805
a five ton truck without touching it.

401
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:50,339
We need to alert the
surviving team members.

402
00:25:52,102 --> 00:25:54,551
One guy had his legs
caught in a combine.

403
00:25:55,189 --> 00:25:57,330
Second was crushed from the pelvis down.

404
00:25:57,537 --> 00:25:59,543
And the third who was dragged
into the generator...

405
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,619
Was that feet first ?

406
00:26:00,623 --> 00:26:02,303
- Yes...
- Connor's near-misses.

407
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:03,902
Either one could have cut his legs off.

408
00:26:04,052 --> 00:26:05,596
Connor, can you think
of anybody who'd have

409
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:06,611
any reason to take

410
00:26:06,612 --> 00:26:08,105
these guys out from the bottom up?

411
00:26:10,574 --> 00:26:11,577
Beeman.

412
00:26:15,798 --> 00:26:16,840
Harry beeman.

413
00:26:23,737 --> 00:26:24,740
Fire doors !

414
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,090
System breach !

415
00:26:28,244 --> 00:26:29,402
Lockdown engaged !

416
00:26:29,466 --> 00:26:30,488
Intruders ?

417
00:26:30,597 --> 00:26:31,581
I can't tell.

418
00:26:31,834 --> 00:26:32,619
Systems are going crazy !

419
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:34,036
Assume the worst.

420
00:26:35,247 --> 00:26:36,270
Ahh !!!!

421
00:26:38,867 --> 00:26:40,509
Seth, secure positions !!!

422
00:26:41,628 --> 00:26:43,307
Riley ! release the weapons locker !

423
00:26:43,358 --> 00:26:44,458
It should be open !

424
00:26:44,459 --> 00:26:46,831
- Well it's not !
- Something's jamming me.

425
00:26:46,974 --> 00:26:48,246
Override's no go.

426
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:50,929
Don't waste the ammo.

427
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,856
We don't know what's
coming, and we've got, what ?

428
00:26:52,881 --> 00:26:55,426
- Twenty rounds each ?
- Extra mags in the fridge.

429
00:27:10,978 --> 00:27:12,406
Riley, the door !!!!

430
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,302
Everybody back !!!

431
00:27:29,303 --> 00:27:30,303
Everybody back !!!

432
00:27:31,423 --> 00:27:32,426
Seth !

433
00:27:44,803 --> 00:27:45,826
Close.

434
00:27:47,353 --> 00:27:48,375
Thanks.

435
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,531
Riley, what's our status?

436
00:27:51,145 --> 00:27:52,804
Systems are completely down.

437
00:27:53,195 --> 00:27:54,628
Check your sidearms.

438
00:27:54,797 --> 00:27:56,418
Connor, divide up those extra mags.

439
00:27:56,492 --> 00:27:57,496
Chip gun ?

440
00:27:57,693 --> 00:27:58,696
Yes.

441
00:27:58,737 --> 00:28:00,454
There's only long range
clips in the fridge.

442
00:28:00,455 --> 00:28:02,761
All the scopes and rifles
are in the weapons locker.

443
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,890
Remind me to store
more stuff in the fridge.

444
00:28:09,303 --> 00:28:10,750
Fire doors came slamming down.

445
00:28:11,094 --> 00:28:12,464
Manual override's jammed.

446
00:28:12,677 --> 00:28:14,028
Then we're sealed in.

447
00:28:14,541 --> 00:28:16,682
Someone's turning our
own security against us.

448
00:28:55,034 --> 00:28:56,037
Harry.

449
00:28:56,308 --> 00:28:57,890
You knew this day was coming.

450
00:28:58,582 --> 00:28:59,624
You earned it.

451
00:29:00,385 --> 00:29:01,657
This is my station.

452
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:03,895
These are my people.

453
00:29:04,355 --> 00:29:06,081
So explain yourself to me.

454
00:29:07,485 --> 00:29:08,920
I don't answer to you !!

455
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:11,246
I don't answer to anybody !!

456
00:29:12,127 --> 00:29:14,346
Not since the day mr. King
left me in a building

457
00:29:14,557 --> 00:29:16,236
where tons of rubble
came down on me.

458
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:18,782
It was a standard perp
extraction, harry.

459
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:21,719
No one knew he'd wired
the place with c-4.

460
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,625
No one could have.

461
00:29:22,626 --> 00:29:24,671
Except maybe the cowards
sent me in first.

462
00:29:25,259 --> 00:29:26,475
It could have
been any of us.

463
00:29:26,485 --> 00:29:28,164
It should have
been all of us!!!!

464
00:29:30,652 --> 00:29:32,027
But you've moved on.

465
00:29:32,413 --> 00:29:33,416
Got a new team.

466
00:29:34,407 --> 00:29:35,468
A brave captain.

467
00:29:36,188 --> 00:29:38,734
But for me, things just stay the same.

468
00:29:39,396 --> 00:29:42,097
In this chair, every day.

469
00:29:42,632 --> 00:29:43,770
That's my life.

470
00:29:44,402 --> 00:29:45,733
Thinking about what should have been.

471
00:29:46,663 --> 00:29:48,012
And what shouldn't.

472
00:29:48,306 --> 00:29:49,656
And then you're life changed,

473
00:29:49,999 --> 00:29:51,600
you developed 'special powers.'

474
00:29:54,177 --> 00:29:55,181
yeah.

475
00:29:56,034 --> 00:29:57,037
Funny, huh ?

476
00:29:57,768 --> 00:30:00,662
Can't move my legs but
i can move a half-ton truck.

477
00:30:00,949 --> 00:30:02,820
And all sorts
of other interesting things,

478
00:30:03,087 --> 00:30:05,190
like loading dock doors
and motorcycle gears

479
00:30:05,791 --> 00:30:07,566
without having to lift a finger.

480
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,253
Guess somebody up there's
looking out for me.

481
00:30:13,996 --> 00:30:14,999
Joe !!!

482
00:30:17,435 --> 00:30:19,017
You won't take me out with machines.

483
00:30:19,157 --> 00:30:21,067
Machines serve me.

484
00:30:24,688 --> 00:30:25,691
He's gone.

485
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,500
Joe !!!

486
00:30:31,258 --> 00:30:32,261
He's gone!!!

487
00:30:33,904 --> 00:30:35,311
Andre! The light!

488
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:43,518
Joe, can you hear me?

489
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:45,234
Seth, the train, if he rolls it...

490
00:30:45,363 --> 00:30:47,330
Joe is down there,
we can't leave him, go help.

491
00:30:50,118 --> 00:30:51,854
Nobody hung
beeman out to dry,

492
00:30:52,906 --> 00:30:53,793
and this was by the books,

493
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,800
it was just damn stupid
luck that he was first in.

494
00:30:56,894 --> 00:30:58,191
And now it's our damn stupid luck

495
00:30:58,192 --> 00:30:59,832
he can use
this equipment against us.

496
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:01,775
You want me to apologize
to the bastard, I will.

497
00:31:02,258 --> 00:31:05,071
But i didn't put him in that chair,
that's not how it went down.

498
00:31:10,811 --> 00:31:12,798
Somehow, i don't think
an apology's going to work.

499
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:13,853
We're talking revenge here.

500
00:31:13,898 --> 00:31:15,249
The guy's been stewing for years.

501
00:31:15,343 --> 00:31:16,442
It might've started that way,

502
00:31:16,705 --> 00:31:18,229
but i don't think that's what it is now.

503
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,486
Seth and joe aren't part of his past.

504
00:31:20,643 --> 00:31:21,936
They weren't on his squad.

505
00:31:22,604 --> 00:31:25,981
He knows i could give a
crap if he took me out first.

506
00:31:26,005 --> 00:31:27,182
He's enjoying himself.

507
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,820
Showing me what he can do to my team

508
00:31:28,836 --> 00:31:30,264
before he takes me down.

509
00:31:31,575 --> 00:31:32,578
The flashlights too.

510
00:31:32,756 --> 00:31:34,357
He's coming at us again!!

511
00:31:35,076 --> 00:31:36,080
Crap.

512
00:31:46,772 --> 00:31:48,046
You're looking okay, joe.

513
00:31:49,191 --> 00:31:50,870
I'm not, but i do what i can.

514
00:31:50,984 --> 00:31:52,238
Good work, seth.

515
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,440
What the hell is he doing ?

516
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,502
Waiting.

517
00:31:54,552 --> 00:31:55,674
He's got the advantage.

518
00:31:56,084 --> 00:31:57,493
Riley, what do we have left ?

519
00:31:58,676 --> 00:32:00,629
There's still power
to the security grid.

520
00:32:01,521 --> 00:32:02,543
But i'm being blocked out.

521
00:32:02,552 --> 00:32:04,987
I'd say our neuro's using
our own grid to spy on us.

522
00:32:05,152 --> 00:32:06,368
That's how he knows where we are.

523
00:32:06,775 --> 00:32:08,048
We're not going to be
able to open the doors

524
00:32:08,049 --> 00:32:10,148
until riley can
regain control of the system.

525
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,262
There's another way out.

526
00:32:13,225 --> 00:32:15,309
Original engineers put
in those fire doors,

527
00:32:15,318 --> 00:32:16,495
to protect the line.

528
00:32:16,595 --> 00:32:18,930
They put in an emergency
evacuation shaft, too.

529
00:32:19,496 --> 00:32:21,484
Where ?
Part of the ventilation tunnel.

530
00:32:21,697 --> 00:32:23,279
There's ladders, manual hatches,

531
00:32:23,571 --> 00:32:24,575
it leads right up to the street.

532
00:32:24,639 --> 00:32:25,643
Lead on.

533
00:32:26,045 --> 00:32:27,047
I'm staying.

534
00:32:28,056 --> 00:32:29,753
I leave here,
he's going to keep on coming.

535
00:32:30,024 --> 00:32:32,440
Okay, by letting him kill you,
that'll stop him ?

536
00:32:32,521 --> 00:32:33,992
No. Idiot.

537
00:32:34,295 --> 00:32:35,463
But i have an idea.

538
00:32:35,991 --> 00:32:37,013
I could use your help.

539
00:32:38,651 --> 00:32:40,079
Are you asking me for help ?

540
00:32:41,518 --> 00:32:43,197
You gonna do it or call
a press conference ?

541
00:32:44,461 --> 00:32:45,773
Fine, i'm in.

542
00:32:46,437 --> 00:32:47,441
Good.

543
00:32:47,791 --> 00:32:48,775
Everybody out of here.

544
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:51,724
I'll be back with some firepower.

545
00:32:51,885 --> 00:32:53,195
I want to hurry.

546
00:32:55,696 --> 00:32:56,718
Let's go !!

547
00:33:05,091 --> 00:33:06,365
Right down here.

548
00:33:11,205 --> 00:33:12,209
Alright.

549
00:33:13,942 --> 00:33:16,855
Your call... Boss.

550
00:33:17,576 --> 00:33:18,811
Down this way.

551
00:33:34,276 --> 00:33:35,306
That's it.

552
00:33:35,692 --> 00:33:36,984
Long way up.

553
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:39,976
Sure, you can make it, joe ?

554
00:33:40,665 --> 00:33:41,668
I race you.

555
00:33:42,143 --> 00:33:43,288
We'll do it together.

556
00:33:50,207 --> 00:33:51,365
Are you kidding me ?

557
00:33:51,366 --> 00:33:52,470
Is it locked ?

558
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,087
Joe, what the hell is that ?

559
00:34:04,402 --> 00:34:05,405
That's crazy.

560
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,646
This stuff's been disconnected
for 15 years.

561
00:34:08,304 --> 00:34:09,982
That doesn't seem to bother beeman.

562
00:34:10,589 --> 00:34:12,672
Please tell me we're not
about to be sucked up

563
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:13,794
into that fan.

564
00:34:16,672 --> 00:34:18,138
Doesn't have that kind of draw.

565
00:34:18,769 --> 00:34:19,791
You feel that breeze, though ?

566
00:34:19,855 --> 00:34:20,974
From the fans.

567
00:34:21,135 --> 00:34:22,563
They're spinning in reverse.

568
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:24,500
They're not blowing
air into this shaft...

569
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,619
They're sucking it out.

570
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:32,279
We make our way up the tracks.

571
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:34,021
Make it look like we know
where we're going...

572
00:34:35,033 --> 00:34:36,056
Like we've got a way out.

573
00:34:37,324 --> 00:34:38,597
If beeman's watching us,

574
00:34:40,789 --> 00:34:42,930
maybe he'll come out of
hiding to stop us.

575
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:47,660
And you need me for
this plan because...?

576
00:34:54,191 --> 00:34:55,580
I want to keep you close to me,

577
00:34:57,251 --> 00:34:58,602
so i keep my eye on you.

578
00:35:00,271 --> 00:35:01,368
I didn't think i could help the others.

579
00:35:01,369 --> 00:35:03,153
Maybe they can help themselves but...

580
00:35:05,428 --> 00:35:06,817
You're the one that matters to me.

581
00:35:09,299 --> 00:35:11,296
Probably the only thing that's
mattered to me in a long time.

582
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,035
Beeman probably knows
how i feel about you.

583
00:35:15,036 --> 00:35:16,465
And that puts you in his spotlight.

584
00:35:16,863 --> 00:35:18,503
If anything happened to you...

585
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:23,519
It'd be worse than hell.

586
00:35:39,273 --> 00:35:40,575
How much air do you think we have ?

587
00:35:41,138 --> 00:35:42,604
We'll know when we run out of breath.

588
00:35:43,837 --> 00:35:45,254
There's a manual hatch at the top.

589
00:35:46,351 --> 00:35:47,768
If we can get there in time.

590
00:35:50,972 --> 00:35:52,990
Riley, let's check it out.

591
00:35:54,206 --> 00:35:55,316
Hustle up.

592
00:36:26,206 --> 00:36:28,316
I don't think,
we have much time left.

593
00:36:34,113 --> 00:36:35,580
Don't stop riley, keep going.

594
00:36:38,547 --> 00:36:39,551
Come on !

595
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:04,725
They have to get
the hatch open.

596
00:37:07,089 --> 00:37:08,246
Andre !!!!

597
00:37:13,423 --> 00:37:14,696
I'm working on it !

598
00:38:00,727 --> 00:38:02,321
"No one could have
seen that coming,"

599
00:38:02,343 --> 00:38:03,626
right, connor ?!!

600
00:38:06,636 --> 00:38:08,508
Just bad luck you sent her in first.

601
00:38:12,394 --> 00:38:13,475
Question...

602
00:38:13,623 --> 00:38:15,514
Can you live with yourself now ?!!

603
00:38:22,709 --> 00:38:23,712
Yeah.

604
00:38:23,978 --> 00:38:25,290
I can live with myself.

605
00:38:37,044 --> 00:38:38,472
Hey, kiddo, you alright ?

606
00:38:41,917 --> 00:38:44,006
The only woman i know
who gets hit by a train

607
00:38:44,007 --> 00:38:45,010
and lives to tell about it.

608
00:38:45,552 --> 00:38:46,575
Ooh !

609
00:38:49,472 --> 00:38:50,880
That looks like it hurt.

610
00:39:05,418 --> 00:39:07,472
Boss, the fan !

611
00:39:09,184 --> 00:39:10,187
The door !

612
00:39:10,896 --> 00:39:12,208
Try the door !

613
00:39:13,672 --> 00:39:14,714
What ?

614
00:39:15,278 --> 00:39:16,571
Open the door !

615
00:39:37,734 --> 00:39:38,737
Clear.

616
00:40:02,548 --> 00:40:03,879
Let's go, come on.

617
00:40:15,981 --> 00:40:17,312
Everybody okay ?

618
00:40:17,755 --> 00:40:18,758
All in one piece.

619
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,296
When the fans stopped, we
knew you must have done it,

620
00:40:22,547 --> 00:40:23,550
you chipped him !

621
00:40:28,303 --> 00:40:29,306
I stopped him.

622
00:40:41,291 --> 00:40:43,122
you don't worry about
that thing starting up

623
00:40:43,123 --> 00:40:44,237
and ripping your face off ?

624
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,318
Maybe i figure it's someone else's turn

625
00:40:46,337 --> 00:40:48,638
to have a homicidal neuro on
their trail this week.

626
00:40:50,583 --> 00:40:52,203
Lightning only strikes once, huh?

627
00:40:52,769 --> 00:40:54,119
Bike's gotta get fixed.

628
00:40:54,843 --> 00:40:55,981
You think on your feet, vasco.

629
00:40:55,982 --> 00:40:56,991
I'll give you that.

630
00:40:58,165 --> 00:41:01,309
When a guy starts declaring
his undying affection,

631
00:41:01,457 --> 00:41:02,441
it wakes you up.

632
00:41:02,522 --> 00:41:05,260
Knowing how sensitive
and romantic you are...

633
00:41:05,261 --> 00:41:06,696
I knew you were up to something.

634
00:41:07,325 --> 00:41:12,032
And being in love with me
obviously wasn't it.

635
00:41:13,116 --> 00:41:14,505
Obviously.

636
00:41:15,344 --> 00:41:16,713
Beeman was watching us.

637
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:18,508
Figured we'd give him a show.

638
00:41:19,238 --> 00:41:20,357
I was betting on the fact

639
00:41:20,409 --> 00:41:23,163
that he hated me enough
to take it out on you.

640
00:41:25,113 --> 00:41:26,116
Lucky me.

641
00:41:26,566 --> 00:41:27,569
It worked.

642
00:41:28,203 --> 00:41:29,206
It did at that.

643
00:41:31,565 --> 00:41:33,580
You get a lot of that ?
Guys 'declaring' ?

644
00:41:35,024 --> 00:41:36,027
I'm a girl.

645
00:41:37,273 --> 00:41:38,662
Occupational hazard.

646
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:46,613
Anything i can do to help ?

647
00:41:48,151 --> 00:41:50,544
- You could hand me that torque wrench.
- This ?

648
00:41:51,528 --> 00:41:52,608
That's the one.

649
00:41:57,089 --> 00:42:00,331
How long you been working on it?

650
00:42:00,555 --> 00:42:01,983
About nine months.

651
00:42:03,728 --> 00:42:04,731
Your baby.

652
00:42:04,808 --> 00:42:05,741
That's the thing.

653
00:42:05,742 --> 00:42:08,306
Women never appreciate the
beauty of a well-built machine.

654
00:42:09,904 --> 00:42:11,294
I'm not so sure about that.

655
00:42:15,368 --> 00:42:18,050
You know what they say about
judging books by their covers.

656
00:42:19,117 --> 00:42:20,622
Maybe it's the same with people.

657
00:42:21,867 --> 00:42:24,054
Some of us work hard to present a cover

658
00:42:24,068 --> 00:42:25,559
to the world around us...

659
00:42:26,029 --> 00:42:27,650
Even to the people we're closest to.

660
00:42:28,793 --> 00:42:31,716
The kind of cover that
makes people to walk by

661
00:42:32,573 --> 00:42:34,319
without ever picking up the book.

662
00:42:35,382 --> 00:42:37,010
The pages remain unread

663
00:42:37,807 --> 00:42:40,392
and there's nothing to be
learned between the lines.

664
00:42:45,193 --> 00:42:48,419
- Hey, you gonna help or watch
- Oh, yeah.

665
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:49,481
Hand me the damn ratchet
wrench over there !

666
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:52,885
This ?

667
00:42:52,986 --> 00:42:53,998
That will do.

668
