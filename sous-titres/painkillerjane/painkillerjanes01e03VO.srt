00:00:00,694 --> 00:00:02,103
My name is Jane Vasco.

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:03,461
I could use you one my team.

3
00:00:03,619 --> 00:00:07,151
I work for a secret govenement agency
that hunts neros.

4
00:00:07,283 --> 00:00:10,171
People who can do dangerous
things with their minds.

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:12,907
On my first assignment...

6
00:00:12,908 --> 00:00:16,463
Something a little
weird happened,
okay, something really weird.

7
00:00:18,657 --> 00:00:22,379
Until i get some answers
i'm getting on with my life,
doing my job.

8
00:00:23,345 --> 00:00:25,956
Stocking up on aspirin,
because let me tell ya,

9
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:29,719
pain's a bitch!

10
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:48,095
What the hell are you doing?

11
00:00:48,096 --> 00:00:50,929
We're not supposed to hit
this sector past seventy!

12
00:00:52,031 --> 00:00:53,406
We're not going to
jump the tracks!!

13
00:00:53,407 --> 00:00:54,343
Throttle back!!

14
00:00:54,344 --> 00:00:55,455
Throttle back now!!!

15
00:00:56,032 --> 00:00:56,469
I...

16
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,343
I don't know how.

17
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:59,156
What the hell are
you talking about!?

18
00:00:59,157 --> 00:01:00,212
I don't know how!!!

19
00:01:18,656 --> 00:01:22,600
They say you can feel
lonelier in a crowd
than when you're by yourself.

20
00:01:23,094 --> 00:01:24,094
Maybe.

21
00:01:24,534 --> 00:01:25,843
I'll tell you this though,

22
00:01:25,844 --> 00:01:29,677
whoever said it, never had
to wade through the crowd
that i ever did.

23
00:01:30,534 --> 00:01:33,589
It's hard to feel lonely
when your every walking moment

24
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,220
is spent trying to avoid
being pick-pocketed,

25
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,381
jostled, hassled
and cursed at.

26
00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:41,191
Did i mention pinched?

27
00:01:42,031 --> 00:01:44,844
I realize i don't live in one
of the better parts of town,

28
00:01:44,845 --> 00:01:47,345
not that there
are many better parts anymore,

29
00:01:47,845 --> 00:01:49,678
and i couldn't afford
one anyway.

30
00:01:50,094 --> 00:01:53,038
When is your environment
an excuse for bad behaviour?

31
00:01:54,344 --> 00:01:56,621
I mean, what happened
to common courtesy?

32
00:01:57,157 --> 00:01:59,045
Is everyone so
completely absorbed

33
00:01:59,094 --> 00:02:00,982
in their own personal
drama today.

34
00:02:03,095 --> 00:02:05,150
Let's just pretend
i didn't ask that.

35
00:02:06,595 --> 00:02:10,483
I realize that appearances
can be deceiving
sometimes a lot deceiving.

36
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:15,470
I mean, let's face it,
life can be deceiving.

37
00:02:17,281 --> 00:02:21,392
Just when we think we got
it all figured out,
it get's turned on its head.

38
00:02:26,309 --> 00:02:28,184
We're not supposed to hit
this sector past seventy!

39
00:02:28,185 --> 00:02:29,559
We're not going to
jump the tracks!!

40
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,495
Throttle back!!

41
00:02:30,496 --> 00:02:31,607
Throttle back now!!!

42
00:02:32,184 --> 00:02:32,558
I...

43
00:02:32,559 --> 00:02:33,558
I don't know how.

44
00:02:33,559 --> 00:02:35,495
What the hell are
you talking about!?

45
00:02:35,496 --> 00:02:36,551
I don't know how!!!

46
00:02:39,279 --> 00:02:42,279
Black box showed
everything on line
and working perfectly.

47
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,557
Unity rail attributes
it to driver error.

48
00:02:45,967 --> 00:02:47,022
Pull up the driver.

49
00:02:49,155 --> 00:02:50,155
Jason hampton.

50
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,716
Good man.

51
00:02:51,717 --> 00:02:52,405
You know him?

52
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:54,591
It's a small world when
it comes to trains.

53
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:57,090
He worked with the rail
company as long as
i worked with the subway.

54
00:02:57,091 --> 00:02:59,313
For the record,
his record was spotless.

55
00:02:59,906 --> 00:03:01,294
Well it just got smudged.

56
00:03:01,466 --> 00:03:03,902
Okay, this might fit the
pattern of other skill-specific

57
00:03:03,903 --> 00:03:06,029
amnesia cases that
we've been tracking.

58
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,028
Any medical?

59
00:03:07,029 --> 00:03:08,029
Nothing significant.

60
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,465
Angio-plasty
five years ago.

61
00:03:09,466 --> 00:03:10,591
Maybe he was suicidal.

62
00:03:10,592 --> 00:03:13,258
He sounded terrified and
confused, not suicidal.

63
00:03:14,466 --> 00:03:18,280
Last week at the hospital,
a patient came in
for a full neurological workup.

64
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,466
He was worried because he
suddenly couldn't remember

65
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:21,967
a critical part
of his job.

66
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:24,028
How often does that happen
seth, where a person

67
00:03:24,029 --> 00:03:25,529
loses part of
their memory?

68
00:03:25,531 --> 00:03:26,280
It's rare.

69
00:03:26,281 --> 00:03:30,058
Usually accompanied by
trauma, an aneurysm,
something psychological.

70
00:03:30,154 --> 00:03:31,876
Edgar dawson had
none of those.

71
00:03:32,217 --> 00:03:33,217
Edgar dawson?

72
00:03:34,466 --> 00:03:35,854
Software fricking genius.

73
00:03:36,342 --> 00:03:39,008
He formulated his own bbs
string matrix network.

74
00:03:39,155 --> 00:03:40,155
Wow.

75
00:03:41,529 --> 00:03:42,405
Vasco,

76
00:03:42,406 --> 00:03:43,965
why don't you have a word
with this edgar,

77
00:03:43,966 --> 00:03:45,715
see if he fits the pattern
we've been tracking.

78
00:03:45,716 --> 00:03:47,216
Better take
an interpreter.

79
00:03:48,157 --> 00:03:49,157
Me?

80
00:03:53,843 --> 00:03:54,898
It's your big shot.

81
00:03:57,778 --> 00:03:58,944
Don't get in her way.

82
00:04:00,571 --> 00:04:01,959
Subtitles: swsub.com/Sixe

Hash four cat algorithm
coded logs
converted by a quad matrix.

84
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:18,570
No man,

85
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,843
unless you're
operating from a...

86
00:04:20,972 --> 00:04:24,027
There's a place
for people like them,
anywhere i'm not.

87
00:04:26,285 --> 00:04:29,340
We had an optical failure
in a fifteen circuit
and i...

88
00:04:29,597 --> 00:04:31,784
I... I still can't even
tell you the formatted
triangulation.

89
00:04:31,785 --> 00:04:34,451
Code protocol for
x- juncture phase development.

90
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:38,298
Secondary milli-ohm
diversion, code nanex,
octo, td... T.d...

91
00:04:45,474 --> 00:04:47,085
They took me
off the project.

92
00:04:47,285 --> 00:04:49,507
Two years of work
and it's just... Gone.

93
00:04:49,786 --> 00:04:52,230
My whole life changed in,
like five minutes.

94
00:04:54,035 --> 00:04:56,722
Mr. Dawson, can you remember
encountering anyone new

95
00:04:56,723 --> 00:04:58,167
just before
this happened?

96
00:04:58,722 --> 00:04:59,722
A stranger?

97
00:04:59,847 --> 00:05:02,284
Someone you might have
been introduced to...

98
00:05:02,285 --> 00:05:03,285
Shook hands with?

99
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:06,597
If it happened...

100
00:05:07,097 --> 00:05:08,652
I'm sorry,
i don't remember.

101
00:05:11,785 --> 00:05:14,840
That ever happens to me,
just put a bullet in my brain.

102
00:05:16,097 --> 00:05:17,721
Life would not
be worth living.

103
00:05:17,722 --> 00:05:19,283
I'll try to keep
that in mind.

104
00:05:19,284 --> 00:05:21,158
Which part of his
did dawson lose?

105
00:05:21,159 --> 00:05:23,034
He's still fluent in
most of what he knows...

106
00:05:23,035 --> 00:05:24,220
Except for what
he doesn't.

107
00:05:24,221 --> 00:05:25,221
And what is that?

108
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:26,848
Edgar dawson has
completely forgotten

109
00:05:26,849 --> 00:05:29,071
a series of third level
code algorithms.

110
00:05:29,096 --> 00:05:30,596
Algorithms that
he created.

111
00:05:30,975 --> 00:05:33,847
It's related to his patent
on high speed electronic relays

112
00:05:33,848 --> 00:05:36,722
that transfers electronic
pulses across a hypernetwork.

113
00:05:36,723 --> 00:05:38,167
Riley,
what's it used for?

114
00:05:40,348 --> 00:05:41,681
Train switching routers.

115
00:05:43,846 --> 00:05:45,971
They use that kind of
electronic relay system now.

116
00:05:45,972 --> 00:05:47,409
Rail conglomerate
grew so fast,

117
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:49,298
switch operators
couldn't keep up.

118
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,598
A train engineer and
the guy who designed

119
00:05:51,599 --> 00:05:53,596
the switching systems
lose part of their memory

120
00:05:53,597 --> 00:05:55,374
within three days
of each other.

121
00:05:55,596 --> 00:05:57,873
Riley, check unity
rail's personnel files

122
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:00,354
see if anyone had
a reason to have a grudge.

123
00:06:00,596 --> 00:06:01,596
Will do, boss.

124
00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:02,599
Thank you.

125
00:06:18,723 --> 00:06:19,723
Get off me!

126
00:06:21,072 --> 00:06:23,016
What the hell
are you doing, man?!!

127
00:06:23,072 --> 00:06:24,516
What are you doing,
man?!!

128
00:06:26,948 --> 00:06:28,114
Are you alright dude?

129
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:30,199
You need
a paramedic, dude.

130
00:06:31,261 --> 00:06:32,261
Easy, easy, easy!!

131
00:06:33,385 --> 00:06:34,385
Stay still man!!

132
00:06:34,885 --> 00:06:35,822
Stay still!!

133
00:06:35,823 --> 00:06:37,656
Easy, easy,
i'll get a paramedic.

134
00:06:50,885 --> 00:06:53,773
Lost consciousness, pulse
is 170, rapid and thready.

135
00:06:55,323 --> 00:06:56,545
Stay back, please sir.

136
00:06:58,074 --> 00:06:59,296
Stay back, please sir.

137
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,175
A- fib with rapid
ventricular response.

138
00:07:08,385 --> 00:07:10,273
Push 20 c.'s
cardiazem in the i.v.

139
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:11,258
No!

140
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:12,314
You could kill him.

141
00:07:12,573 --> 00:07:13,446
We've got it covered.

142
00:07:13,447 --> 00:07:17,613
Then why are you trying to
skyrocket his heartrate
and send him into v-fib?

143
00:07:19,635 --> 00:07:21,857
Wpw syndrome, vitals
might read the same

144
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,954
but the ekg's got a delta
wave, qrs is wide.

145
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:28,175
Cardiazem's going to block
the av node,

146
00:07:28,196 --> 00:07:30,084
push his heart
rate into the 200s!

147
00:07:30,636 --> 00:07:33,571
We've got to shock his rhythm
so it slows back to sinus.

148
00:07:33,572 --> 00:07:35,960
Get me paddles and
charge it to 200 joules.

149
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:37,323
He might be right.

150
00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:38,949
Now!

151
00:07:46,636 --> 00:07:47,636
Clear!

152
00:07:52,324 --> 00:07:53,324
He's stabilizing.

153
00:07:53,761 --> 00:07:54,816
I don't believe it.

154
00:08:06,448 --> 00:08:07,781
Hey, hey,
stick with us.

155
00:08:15,571 --> 00:08:16,571
Grab the bag.

156
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:24,136
Stay with us.

157
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:45,633
...when paramedics started
to initiate an i.v. Drip

158
00:08:45,634 --> 00:08:47,911
with a semplar push
subject informed them

159
00:08:48,072 --> 00:08:49,849
the patient had
tertiary anemia.

160
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,349
Caller reported
he had diagnosed

161
00:08:53,385 --> 00:08:55,551
from the pulse pattern
and dried blood.

162
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,259
The trick is to only suture
the first fifteen millimeters

163
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,482
of the primary sheath.

164
00:09:06,822 --> 00:09:08,071
...that way the tissue
can accept

165
00:09:08,072 --> 00:09:10,072
the artificial
intrusion as organic.

166
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,196
You're an m.d.

167
00:09:12,197 --> 00:09:13,073
Uh-huh.

168
00:09:13,074 --> 00:09:14,008
Where did you study?

169
00:09:14,009 --> 00:09:15,009
Johns hopkins.

170
00:09:15,134 --> 00:09:17,323
I specialized in
neuro-muscular syndromes.

171
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:18,698
I've written
extensively about it.

172
00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:19,258
Oh?

173
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:21,981
The nordic degeneration
and the middle aged male.

174
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,008
Dr. Allen rafferty
wrote that article.

175
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:25,009
That's right.

176
00:09:40,196 --> 00:09:41,072
Five months ago,

177
00:09:41,073 --> 00:09:43,383
allen was in the middle
of an aortic bypass.

178
00:09:43,384 --> 00:09:44,884
He's done
hundreds of them.

179
00:09:45,197 --> 00:09:48,697
They said he just, froze,
he couldn't remember
how to continue.

180
00:09:49,884 --> 00:09:51,606
The assisting
had to take over.

181
00:09:52,385 --> 00:09:53,718
The patient almost died.

182
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,066
Neurologist
checked him out?

183
00:09:58,884 --> 00:10:00,772
They couldn't find
anything wrong.

184
00:10:01,823 --> 00:10:04,934
Everything allen knew
about medicine,
it's just... Gone.

185
00:10:10,261 --> 00:10:11,538
Allen knew it was over.

186
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:15,342
Medicine was his life and
he just couldn't face it.

187
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,676
He started drinking..

188
00:10:19,571 --> 00:10:20,571
And then...

189
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:23,064
...he tried to
kill himself.

190
00:10:23,885 --> 00:10:25,607
I got to him in
time but now...

191
00:10:28,497 --> 00:10:30,552
How could something
like this happen?

192
00:10:33,307 --> 00:10:34,995
There's only a handful of
surgeons in the city

193
00:10:34,996 --> 00:10:36,884
who can do what
dr. Rafferty does.

194
00:10:36,996 --> 00:10:39,497
This homeless man knew his
procedures as well as he did.

195
00:10:39,498 --> 00:10:41,932
So we're not talking about
sudden partial amnesia...

196
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:43,370
It's about picking
people's brains.

197
00:10:43,371 --> 00:10:44,308
Looks that way.

198
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:45,494
And no, he's not a neuro.

199
00:10:45,495 --> 00:10:46,495
I tested him.

200
00:10:47,185 --> 00:10:49,682
In order to have acquired
rafferty's knowledge,

201
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:50,933
there must have
been a middle man.

202
00:10:50,934 --> 00:10:51,934
It would seem so.

203
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:54,370
Three victims.

204
00:10:54,498 --> 00:10:55,775
Two areas of knowledge.

205
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:56,921
Trains and medicine.

206
00:10:59,807 --> 00:11:01,362
What do they
have in common?

207
00:11:55,826 --> 00:11:56,699
There was no answer
when i knocked.

208
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,588
I heard some noises
i was singing.

209
00:12:04,513 --> 00:12:05,513
What?

210
00:12:07,637 --> 00:12:08,637
I was singing!

211
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:12,075
When i didn't
hear an answer,

212
00:12:12,076 --> 00:12:13,575
i thought there might
be problem so i...

213
00:12:13,576 --> 00:12:14,687
You picked the lock!

214
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:16,200
It's really not
that difficult.

215
00:12:16,201 --> 00:12:17,923
What are you doing
here, riley?

216
00:12:18,326 --> 00:12:19,881
Just walking,
taking a walk.

217
00:12:20,763 --> 00:12:22,151
You live five miles away.

218
00:12:23,263 --> 00:12:24,263
Want some wine?

219
00:12:24,951 --> 00:12:25,951
No, i don't.

220
00:12:29,263 --> 00:12:30,651
It's for the best anyway.

221
00:12:33,701 --> 00:12:36,145
I found no connections
between the engineer,

222
00:12:37,201 --> 00:12:38,812
edgar dawson
or dr. Rafferty.

223
00:12:39,076 --> 00:12:39,762
That's great.

224
00:12:39,763 --> 00:12:40,261
Yeah.

225
00:12:40,262 --> 00:12:42,575
You came all the way over
here to tell me that.

226
00:12:42,576 --> 00:12:44,631
I did see something
else interesting.

227
00:12:51,576 --> 00:12:52,742
I'm listening, riley.

228
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,033
There was a break-in at
the pharmacy close to where

229
00:13:00,138 --> 00:13:02,386
the paramedics worked
on the homeless guy.

230
00:13:02,387 --> 00:13:05,053
Junkies break into
pharmacies every ten minutes.

231
00:13:05,138 --> 00:13:06,860
There weren't
any drugs stolen,

232
00:13:07,701 --> 00:13:10,423
at least not the kind
of drugs that get you high.

233
00:13:11,015 --> 00:13:12,348
Hemoglobin accelerators.

234
00:13:13,327 --> 00:13:15,201
The paramedics used
hemoglobin accelerators

235
00:13:15,202 --> 00:13:16,764
on the guy having
the seizure.

236
00:13:16,765 --> 00:13:18,950
What you're saying is
the man who had the seizure
was the middleman.

237
00:13:18,951 --> 00:13:22,117
He'd need someone with some
medical expertise to help him

238
00:13:22,451 --> 00:13:24,451
doctors can't
operate on themselves.

239
00:13:26,007 --> 00:13:27,007
Unless...

240
00:13:27,757 --> 00:13:29,312
He contact with dr. Rafferty

241
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:31,381
he could have taken
his medical knowledge.

242
00:13:31,382 --> 00:13:33,256
If he had contact
with dr. Rafferty,

243
00:13:33,257 --> 00:13:35,312
why not just have
rafferty treat him?

244
00:13:35,445 --> 00:13:37,500
If i had all the answers,
i'd be you.

245
00:13:39,447 --> 00:13:40,447
Exactly.

246
00:13:40,508 --> 00:13:41,821
You sure you
don't have any wine.

247
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:42,569
No, riley.

248
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,125
I still don't
have any wine.

249
00:13:46,822 --> 00:13:49,877
Look, i was thinking we could
check out the pharmacies.

250
00:13:50,322 --> 00:13:53,266
So you didn't just "happen"
to be in my neighborhood.

251
00:13:58,321 --> 00:13:58,819
Look.

252
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,764
I know you want to be
in the field.

253
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:03,326
And i know you know
that i have a reputation

254
00:14:03,694 --> 00:14:05,527
for not always going
by the book.

255
00:14:07,132 --> 00:14:08,132
But not now...

256
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,320
Not tonight.

257
00:14:11,446 --> 00:14:12,446
Okay?

258
00:14:28,264 --> 00:14:31,319
Hey, riley,
we'll grab a drink
another time, i promise.

259
00:15:14,702 --> 00:15:15,702
Help!!

260
00:15:29,066 --> 00:15:30,899
Probably an isolated
rib fracture

261
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,518
or
minor costochondral separation.

262
00:15:34,815 --> 00:15:36,537
Not much we can do,
either way.

263
00:15:36,942 --> 00:15:38,108
It'll just take time.

264
00:15:39,752 --> 00:15:41,314
Wouldn't hurt to get an
abdominal exam

265
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,426
to rule out splenic
or hepatic trauma.

266
00:15:44,442 --> 00:15:46,878
You're the one with dr.
Rafferty's medical knowledge.

267
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,323
Seth, was looking
for you.

268
00:15:49,505 --> 00:15:50,505
The homeless guy.

269
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,690
The one you told
the paramedics how to treat.

270
00:15:56,816 --> 00:15:58,704
Can you tell me
where to find him?

271
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,440
Yeah.

272
00:16:04,628 --> 00:16:05,739
You found the neuro?

273
00:16:06,317 --> 00:16:07,317
I'm with him now.

274
00:16:08,815 --> 00:16:10,648
Alley behind
seventh, and colter.

275
00:16:11,315 --> 00:16:13,926
Riley, listen to me,
we'll be there in fifteen.

276
00:16:14,002 --> 00:16:14,628
Don't move.

277
00:16:14,629 --> 00:16:16,004
Don't do anything
til we get there.

278
00:16:16,005 --> 00:16:17,005
You got that?

279
00:16:18,628 --> 00:16:19,628
Yeah, don't worry.

280
00:16:20,504 --> 00:16:22,115
I'm in too much
pain to move.

281
00:16:23,003 --> 00:16:24,003
Good work, riley.

282
00:16:48,964 --> 00:16:49,652
Charlie, you let me know,

283
00:16:49,653 --> 00:16:52,819
you see anything, i'm going
to take care of you, alright.

284
00:16:52,841 --> 00:16:54,285
Nothing, not a damn thing!

285
00:16:56,091 --> 00:16:57,757
C'mon,
i told him to stay put!

286
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:08,777
Hey, there he is!!

287
00:17:28,788 --> 00:17:29,899
Riley, what's wrong?

288
00:17:29,976 --> 00:17:31,162
Riley, talk to us,
what happened?!

289
00:17:31,163 --> 00:17:32,940
What do you people
want from me?

290
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,608
Where's the neuro, riley?

291
00:17:39,282 --> 00:17:40,282
What's a neuro?

292
00:18:01,032 --> 00:18:02,365
Why can't i access this?

293
00:18:11,034 --> 00:18:12,867
It's not partial
like the others.

294
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,724
Riley has full on amnesia.

295
00:18:17,403 --> 00:18:18,903
Did you tell
him who he is?

296
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:20,214
Just that we're
his friends.

297
00:18:20,215 --> 00:18:21,881
I don't want to
overwhelm him.

298
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:25,339
The thought of riley being
overwhelmed by anything...

299
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,153
What did riley tell
you last night?

300
00:18:27,154 --> 00:18:30,709
That someone had stolen
hemoglobin accelerators
from a pharmacy.

301
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:33,839
The same meds
the paramedics used to save
the man with the seizure.

302
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,216
The man with the seizure
is the neuro.

303
00:18:35,217 --> 00:18:37,526
Probably suffering
from linortic degenertia.

304
00:18:37,527 --> 00:18:40,527
Something dr. Rafferty had
done extensive research on.

305
00:18:40,902 --> 00:18:42,124
What are the symptoms?

306
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:43,276
There are plenty.

307
00:18:43,277 --> 00:18:45,777
But the most obvious
would be poor balance...

308
00:18:45,903 --> 00:18:46,401
Trouble walking.

309
00:18:46,402 --> 00:18:48,290
It's chronic and
eventually fatal.

310
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,284
Riley found
the bastard last night.

311
00:18:51,717 --> 00:18:54,772
He wanted me to go with him
and check out the pharmacy.

312
00:18:55,027 --> 00:18:56,027
Only i didn't.

313
00:18:58,902 --> 00:19:01,900
If our neuro does have this
linotype degenerate whatever,

314
00:19:01,901 --> 00:19:04,839
it makes sense to take
the knowledge from the doctor.

315
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,713
But how does that fit
with a train engineer

316
00:19:06,714 --> 00:19:08,769
and edgar dawson's
railroad switches?

317
00:19:08,965 --> 00:19:09,652
They're neuros.

318
00:19:09,653 --> 00:19:11,319
They don't have
to make sense.

319
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:14,082
Vasco, bowers, get
on riley's system.

320
00:19:14,276 --> 00:19:15,403
See what he was
looking at.

321
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,214
Seth, get in touch
with the hospitals

322
00:19:17,215 --> 00:19:19,464
and see if there has been
any reports on similar seizures

323
00:19:19,465 --> 00:19:21,338
get me a description
from the paramedics.

324
00:19:21,339 --> 00:19:23,025
Connor, you and i are
gonna hit the streets.

325
00:19:23,026 --> 00:19:24,025
Maureen can cover
the computer.

326
00:19:24,026 --> 00:19:25,526
I'll be more
help with you.

327
00:19:26,401 --> 00:19:27,401
Why?

328
00:19:27,589 --> 00:19:30,255
Because you didn't go out
with riley last night.

329
00:19:30,339 --> 00:19:31,339
No.

330
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,590
Please.

331
00:19:35,528 --> 00:19:36,528
Let me help.

332
00:19:37,716 --> 00:19:38,525
Not now.

333
00:19:38,526 --> 00:19:39,526
Not tonight.

334
00:19:41,026 --> 00:19:42,803
What if we've
lost riley, andre?

335
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,339
What if we've lost him?

336
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,562
We haven't lost riley.

337
00:19:48,464 --> 00:19:49,464
Only his mind.

338
00:19:49,714 --> 00:19:50,714
Hey!

339
00:19:52,154 --> 00:19:53,654
I don't need that
from you.

340
00:20:01,527 --> 00:20:04,804
According to the paramedics,
looking for a "caucasian male.

341
00:20:06,529 --> 00:20:08,751
"late 40's to early 50's,
5'8" to 5'10".

342
00:20:11,089 --> 00:20:12,144
"150 to 170 pounds.

343
00:20:14,402 --> 00:20:15,214
"ragged clothing.

344
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:17,548
"hadn't bathed in a while."
your point is?

345
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,714
I don't know!?

346
00:20:26,715 --> 00:20:27,589
I'm not riley!

347
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,527
I didn't say you were.

348
00:20:28,528 --> 00:20:29,528
You were implying!

349
00:20:30,653 --> 00:20:32,088
I'm as frustrated
as you are.

350
00:20:32,089 --> 00:20:33,477
I just wish
he were here.

351
00:20:35,779 --> 00:20:37,223
It's not
your fault, jane.

352
00:20:41,902 --> 00:20:43,457
I should have gone
with him.

353
00:20:46,339 --> 00:20:47,561
Yeah, let's try again.

354
00:20:50,526 --> 00:20:51,637
I'm riley,
aren't i?

355
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:56,589
Yes.

356
00:21:01,028 --> 00:21:02,750
I'm some kind of
computer geek.

357
00:21:08,528 --> 00:21:10,305
In the best
possible sense, yes.

358
00:21:13,902 --> 00:21:14,957
Do you want to try?

359
00:22:47,527 --> 00:22:48,804
Warning
system failure!

360
00:22:49,089 --> 00:22:50,366
Warning system failure!

361
00:22:57,902 --> 00:22:59,124
It's going to be okay.

362
00:23:15,262 --> 00:23:16,262
Help me, please.

363
00:24:24,947 --> 00:24:25,947
How'd he do?

364
00:24:26,134 --> 00:24:27,134
Slept all night.

365
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,621
More than i can say.

366
00:24:32,886 --> 00:24:33,572
Morning guys!

367
00:24:33,573 --> 00:24:34,573
Hey, jane.

368
00:24:38,262 --> 00:24:39,539
Riley, what's going on?

369
00:24:42,763 --> 00:24:43,985
Well, this is a bitch.

370
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:03,911
Tunnel's been breached.

371
00:25:06,947 --> 00:25:09,502
What the hell happened
to the security system?

372
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,013
Yes!

373
00:25:30,635 --> 00:25:33,857
Your security system
isn't working
because i shut it down.

374
00:25:39,946 --> 00:25:41,723
I suppose i should
be flattered.

375
00:25:41,947 --> 00:25:42,947
An entire team...

376
00:25:43,447 --> 00:25:44,724
The best of the best...

377
00:25:44,822 --> 00:25:46,633
Devoted to following
and finding...

378
00:25:46,634 --> 00:25:47,634
People like me.

379
00:25:48,322 --> 00:25:51,155
Your friend riley's mind
is a vault of information.

380
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:55,387
Neuros.

381
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,593
That's what you call us.

382
00:26:01,135 --> 00:26:03,801
At least i'm glad to know
i'm not alone in my...

383
00:26:04,011 --> 00:26:05,011
Uniqueness.

384
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:06,308
Your lucky day, pal.

385
00:26:08,072 --> 00:26:10,572
I'm about to arrange for
you to join the rest

386
00:26:10,823 --> 00:26:13,156
of the freaks so you
won't feel so lonely.

387
00:26:13,637 --> 00:26:15,386
If you ever want to
see your friend again...

388
00:26:15,387 --> 00:26:16,387
Intact,

389
00:26:16,823 --> 00:26:18,989
that might not be
the wise thing to do.

390
00:26:19,198 --> 00:26:20,198
Wait!

391
00:26:21,447 --> 00:26:22,502
Let's hear him out.

392
00:26:23,386 --> 00:26:26,197
We don't know if anyone
can restore riley's memory.

393
00:26:26,198 --> 00:26:27,198
I can.

394
00:26:27,822 --> 00:26:29,044
I can steal knowledge.

395
00:26:29,072 --> 00:26:30,460
I can transfer knowledge.

396
00:26:31,571 --> 00:26:32,904
I can restore knowledge.

397
00:26:33,448 --> 00:26:34,448
He can.

398
00:26:35,387 --> 00:26:37,220
I got a call from
carla rafferty.

399
00:26:37,322 --> 00:26:39,635
Dr. Rafferty seems to have
made a complete recovery.

400
00:26:39,636 --> 00:26:41,247
Call it a show
of good faith.

401
00:26:41,761 --> 00:26:42,761
And proof.

402
00:26:43,447 --> 00:26:45,335
Alright,
what do you want from us?

403
00:26:45,822 --> 00:26:48,044
In exchange for riley,
i want your help.

404
00:26:49,948 --> 00:26:50,948
What kind of help?

405
00:26:53,698 --> 00:26:55,142
I want you
to rob a train.

406
00:26:59,941 --> 00:27:01,385
My name is simon connolly.

407
00:27:02,564 --> 00:27:03,564
I'm ill.

408
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:06,008
But you probably already
know that.

409
00:27:06,313 --> 00:27:07,701
There's something i want.

410
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,959
Something that's
important to me.

411
00:27:10,877 --> 00:27:13,126
It's being shipped
in a high security container

412
00:27:13,127 --> 00:27:15,238
aboard freight
rail line 122 tomorrow.

413
00:27:17,126 --> 00:27:18,375
If the robbery's successful,

414
00:27:18,376 --> 00:27:20,042
and i get
to do what i want...

415
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,384
I'll restore riley's mind.

416
00:27:24,002 --> 00:27:26,890
I'm prepared,
when this is over,
for you to chip me.

417
00:27:29,065 --> 00:27:31,565
Andre, this is our only
chance to save riley.

418
00:27:32,126 --> 00:27:33,514
Even if we agree to this,

419
00:27:34,502 --> 00:27:37,835
what makes you so sure we have
the expertise to rob a train?

420
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:42,311
What's the transfer rate
of the l-6 video lines
from central rail control?

421
00:27:42,312 --> 00:27:43,867
17 bits at 230k,
26.1 at 180

422
00:27:45,876 --> 00:27:49,153
security system code
matrix from car 17
from the same line?

423
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,876
Random 14 symbol
evolving algorithm,

424
00:27:52,313 --> 00:27:54,090
expression key
rio, 4, x, omega.

425
00:27:55,375 --> 00:27:59,041
De-coupling override
procedure for transrail
4000 c series engine?

426
00:28:00,688 --> 00:28:03,243
Coupling to manual,
enter override code odx 9,

427
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:07,384
program auto
sector postvelocities
and program the connection.

428
00:28:08,689 --> 00:28:10,126
Switch codes within
five kilometers

429
00:28:10,127 --> 00:28:11,793
of the sector
4 central point?

430
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:16,436
You were here last night.

431
00:28:16,437 --> 00:28:17,492
Among other places.

432
00:28:32,938 --> 00:28:33,938
Help me, please.

433
00:28:42,691 --> 00:28:45,413
If we're doing this,
we're doing it on our terms.

434
00:28:47,876 --> 00:28:50,820
You won't need any
additional knowledge,
agent vasco.

435
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:55,245
You'll be handling
the most physically challenging
part of the operation.

436
00:29:01,562 --> 00:29:02,617
What are you doing?

437
00:29:03,126 --> 00:29:04,959
Doing what riley
would have done.

438
00:29:05,626 --> 00:29:08,292
Manipulating the system
to the team's advantage.

439
00:29:12,314 --> 00:29:14,036
You have an
amazing gift, jane.

440
00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:16,188
Yeah, well... Some might
call it a curse.

441
00:29:16,189 --> 00:29:18,000
Applying my special
talents to the others

442
00:29:18,001 --> 00:29:19,612
didn't pose a problem
for me.

443
00:29:19,938 --> 00:29:22,826
But, when it came to you,
knowing what i know now...

444
00:29:23,313 --> 00:29:25,090
Are you suggesting
i'm like you?

445
00:29:25,562 --> 00:29:28,228
All i know is that it
somehow didn't feel right.

446
00:29:29,191 --> 00:29:30,468
I'm on your side, jane.

447
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:34,979
To be honest, i'm a bit
saddened that you're not on mine.

448
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:37,187
Have you ever
stopped to wonder

449
00:29:37,188 --> 00:29:39,410
just which side might
be the right side?

450
00:29:40,251 --> 00:29:42,028
Is being different
such a crime?

451
00:29:43,437 --> 00:29:46,103
Two people are dead
because of what you've done.

452
00:29:47,751 --> 00:29:50,195
Something i deeply regret
and didn't intend.

453
00:29:52,065 --> 00:29:53,813
That puts you
on the road to hell

454
00:29:53,814 --> 00:29:55,314
with a lot
of other people.

455
00:29:57,127 --> 00:29:58,182
I'll give you that.

456
00:30:00,126 --> 00:30:02,570
But where does your
being different put you?

457
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:16,749
Six two, you have
a clear line

458
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,527
to western connect depot
at 0917

459
00:30:19,627 --> 00:30:22,960
roger control, proceeding
out on yard track
a- four-seven...

460
00:30:24,001 --> 00:30:26,612
Connecting to line six-b
at kilometer two-five.

461
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,777
K-317 you are clear
to proceed west at 7.

462
00:30:42,167 --> 00:30:43,667
Conductor,
we're under way.

463
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:46,798
Yeah,
cargo restraints holding.

464
00:31:27,391 --> 00:31:29,224
Artificial contact
with line 122.

465
00:31:33,515 --> 00:31:34,515
Track switch.

466
00:31:40,017 --> 00:31:41,628
60 seconds
to switch contact.

467
00:31:45,267 --> 00:31:46,267
I'm going hot.

468
00:31:47,391 --> 00:31:48,391
All clear here.

469
00:31:49,266 --> 00:31:50,266
Cargo?

470
00:31:51,203 --> 00:31:52,203
Holding.

471
00:31:56,142 --> 00:31:57,364
40 seconds to contact.

472
00:31:58,203 --> 00:31:59,425
Let's keep this tight.

473
00:32:07,266 --> 00:32:08,266
30 seconds.

474
00:32:15,453 --> 00:32:16,675
Monitor 3 is off-line.

475
00:32:18,141 --> 00:32:19,141
15 seconds.

476
00:32:25,329 --> 00:32:26,940
10, 9, 8, 7, 6,
5, 4, 3, 2, 1

477
00:32:38,192 --> 00:32:39,192
we're good to go.

478
00:32:39,505 --> 00:32:40,505
We made contact.

479
00:32:45,695 --> 00:32:46,695
Am i low in here?

480
00:33:05,945 --> 00:33:06,945
We're back on.

481
00:33:23,505 --> 00:33:24,505
Come on, come on.

482
00:33:32,263 --> 00:33:33,263
What's that?

483
00:33:34,388 --> 00:33:35,499
Electrostatic pulse.

484
00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:38,111
15,000 volts if you
want to be specific.

485
00:33:38,825 --> 00:33:40,991
He wants us to steal
it from that safe.

486
00:33:45,203 --> 00:33:47,203
Don't tell me
you can't turn it off.

487
00:33:48,267 --> 00:33:49,267
What do we have?

488
00:33:50,327 --> 00:33:51,604
A really bad situation.

489
00:33:56,181 --> 00:33:58,736
sorry, jane, i don't know
what else we can do.

490
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,617
The electricity is generated
from that junction box.

491
00:34:03,618 --> 00:34:05,340
We get too close,
we get fried.

492
00:34:07,493 --> 00:34:08,492
This is a
re-direct circuit.

493
00:34:08,493 --> 00:34:09,869
It attracts
electrical energy.

494
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:12,758
Get it on the junction box
and it'll fry itself out.

495
00:34:15,118 --> 00:34:16,506
It's the only way i know.

496
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:17,929
This is unacceptable!!

497
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,096
You find another way!

498
00:34:20,244 --> 00:34:22,556
There's no way
to gage the electrical
output of this thing,

499
00:34:22,557 --> 00:34:24,869
it could fry whatever
gift i have to a crisp.

500
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:26,314
Along with the rest of me.

501
00:34:37,305 --> 00:34:38,305
Let's hear it.

502
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:39,868
Hear what?

503
00:34:40,806 --> 00:34:41,806
The alternative.

504
00:34:43,056 --> 00:34:44,944
I'm ready to hear
the alternative.

505
00:34:45,742 --> 00:34:46,742
You're funny.

506
00:34:49,118 --> 00:34:51,118
Jane, we've done
all this for riley.

507
00:34:56,369 --> 00:34:57,369
Yeah.

508
00:35:07,994 --> 00:35:08,994
Good luck.

509
00:35:09,118 --> 00:35:10,118
Bite me.

510
00:35:11,306 --> 00:35:12,972
I'm really going
to hate this.

511
00:35:26,493 --> 00:35:27,993
Do not ask me
if i'm okay!!

512
00:35:29,868 --> 00:35:31,756
Just find out what's
in the crate!

513
00:35:40,807 --> 00:35:42,029
What the hell is that?

514
00:35:46,618 --> 00:35:48,840
We did all this
for a freaking painting.

515
00:35:57,369 --> 00:36:00,035
I was ten years old when
i sat for the painting.

516
00:36:01,806 --> 00:36:03,306
He was unknown
at the time.

517
00:36:04,306 --> 00:36:05,639
My dad lost his business

518
00:36:06,306 --> 00:36:07,750
and was forced
to sell it.

519
00:36:08,744 --> 00:36:11,355
Who knew it would
eventually be worth millions.

520
00:36:12,367 --> 00:36:14,644
Funny things is,
i never really liked it.

521
00:36:16,743 --> 00:36:17,992
I was always embarrassed

522
00:36:17,993 --> 00:36:19,993
when my friends
came over and saw it.

523
00:36:19,994 --> 00:36:22,438
But when it was taken
away, i felt, somehow,

524
00:36:23,619 --> 00:36:25,507
that a piece of me
was taken away.

525
00:36:25,931 --> 00:36:27,741
When i heard that it was
being shipped

526
00:36:27,742 --> 00:36:29,304
to another city
for a showing...

527
00:36:29,305 --> 00:36:30,305
It was my chance.

528
00:36:30,807 --> 00:36:32,418
To experience
life as it was.

529
00:36:37,181 --> 00:36:38,181
One more time.

530
00:36:39,431 --> 00:36:40,431
Before i died.

531
00:36:43,806 --> 00:36:45,616
Why steal
dr. Rafferty's knowledge?

532
00:36:45,617 --> 00:36:46,741
Why not just go
to a hospital?

533
00:36:46,742 --> 00:36:48,368
I watched my father
die in a hospital.

534
00:36:48,369 --> 00:36:49,369
It wasn't pretty.

535
00:36:49,932 --> 00:36:50,987
If i could help it,

536
00:36:51,431 --> 00:36:53,492
it wasn't going
to be the way i went out.

537
00:36:53,493 --> 00:36:54,548
So was it worth it?

538
00:36:54,929 --> 00:36:55,929
For this moment?

539
00:36:58,433 --> 00:36:59,433
Not sure.

540
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:02,340
I can tell you this...

541
00:37:04,118 --> 00:37:05,673
It's not like
it was before.

542
00:37:06,556 --> 00:37:07,556
But then...

543
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,124
I'm not like
i was before.

544
00:37:27,431 --> 00:37:28,431
I'm ready.

545
00:37:35,867 --> 00:37:36,931
Whatever the reason,

546
00:37:36,932 --> 00:37:39,820
whether some part of
me thought i was a part of him,

547
00:37:39,929 --> 00:37:43,206
or because i just
plain old felt sorry for him,
i couldn't.

548
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:07,380
If you leave,
we'll know about it.

549
00:38:09,493 --> 00:38:10,493
Don't leave.

550
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:52,553
Something on
your mind, agent vasco?

551
00:38:52,554 --> 00:38:53,554
Yeah,

552
00:38:54,182 --> 00:38:57,404
i was wondering you made the
decision you made back there?

553
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,992
Why did you decide not
to send him to nico?

554
00:38:59,993 --> 00:39:01,548
Don't read too
much into it.

555
00:39:02,055 --> 00:39:03,430
The man doesn't
have too long to live

556
00:39:03,431 --> 00:39:05,741
if he decides
to go anywhere, we'll find him.

557
00:39:05,742 --> 00:39:06,742
Burns healed?

558
00:39:07,057 --> 00:39:08,057
Almost.

559
00:39:09,618 --> 00:39:10,241
Which is...

560
00:39:10,242 --> 00:39:12,991
More than i can say for every
stitch of clothing i had on.

561
00:39:12,992 --> 00:39:15,880
You know, i go through a lot
of clothes on this job.

562
00:39:16,492 --> 00:39:18,055
Maybe the agency
might think of...

563
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:18,616
No.

564
00:39:18,617 --> 00:39:19,783
...compensating me...

565
00:39:19,994 --> 00:39:22,216
Just throw it out there,
see what stuck.

566
00:39:24,805 --> 00:39:25,805
Riley?

567
00:39:35,807 --> 00:39:36,807
What's wrong?

568
00:39:37,367 --> 00:39:40,533
Simon seems to have given
riley back his thoughts,
but...

569
00:39:41,493 --> 00:39:42,493
But...?

570
00:39:43,368 --> 00:39:45,179
There seems to be
a bit of a problem,

571
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:47,366
he knows his name and
that he works here.

572
00:39:47,367 --> 00:39:49,680
But when i checked the logic
side of his brain

573
00:39:49,681 --> 00:39:52,014
with some simple
questions, for example...

574
00:39:52,367 --> 00:39:53,367
Seven minus one.

575
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:01,764
Seven minus one is zero.

576
00:40:07,994 --> 00:40:09,327
Seven minus one is zero.

577
00:40:12,242 --> 00:40:13,797
Seven minus
one is not zero.

578
00:40:17,806 --> 00:40:20,083
It depends how you
quantify the equation.

579
00:40:21,368 --> 00:40:24,868
Seven people on this team
minus one of me
amounts to six zeros.

580
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:34,734
Since six times zero
is still zero...

581
00:40:36,492 --> 00:40:37,492
Without me...

582
00:40:38,492 --> 00:40:39,492
We're nothing.

583
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,013
Now there's a smart man.

584
00:40:50,056 --> 00:40:52,889
Stephen hawkings has nothing
on riley jensen, baby.

585
00:40:53,867 --> 00:40:57,054
Okay, we're three days behind
our systems maintenance report,

586
00:40:57,055 --> 00:40:58,110
riley get cracking,

587
00:40:58,432 --> 00:41:00,154
connor, bring
them up to speed.

588
00:41:00,432 --> 00:41:02,598
What is the systems
maintenance report?

589
00:41:06,974 --> 00:41:10,585
Like i said,
appearances are deceiving,
what makes people special

590
00:41:10,974 --> 00:41:13,307
is not always what
you see on the outside.

591
00:41:13,474 --> 00:41:16,196
Unless you're a nudist,
but that's not the point.

592
00:41:18,561 --> 00:41:20,394
It really is
beautiful, you know.

593
00:41:23,061 --> 00:41:24,116
You were beautiful.

594
00:41:24,689 --> 00:41:25,623
The point is

595
00:41:25,624 --> 00:41:29,235
love or hate what
makes us different,
it does make us who we are.

596
00:41:30,436 --> 00:41:31,547
To take that away...

597
00:41:31,937 --> 00:41:34,248
I thought i would feel
this remarkable sense of loss

598
00:41:34,249 --> 00:41:35,582
when the power
was gone.

599
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,055
But i don't really.

600
00:41:39,749 --> 00:41:41,193
I feel very much the same.

601
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,500
Or am i the same?

602
00:41:45,499 --> 00:41:46,499
That chip gun...

603
00:41:47,625 --> 00:41:48,847
You put a blank in it.

604
00:41:52,064 --> 00:41:53,619
Don't read too
much into it.

605
00:41:53,749 --> 00:41:56,873
When the hunters begin
to realize they've
become the hunted...

606
00:41:56,874 --> 00:41:58,207
You got what you wanted.

607
00:41:59,625 --> 00:42:01,687
You'll spend your last
days in your own home.

608
00:42:01,688 --> 00:42:02,688
And intact.

609
00:42:05,251 --> 00:42:07,639
Don't believe you know
everything about me.

610
00:42:08,124 --> 00:42:09,290
We're monitoring you.

611
00:42:09,874 --> 00:42:12,651
Take one step off
these premises,
i will kill you.

612
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:24,310
With the surprise
that andre mcbride did
something

613
00:42:24,311 --> 00:42:27,199
that andre mcbride never does,
give a neuro a break,

614
00:42:29,563 --> 00:42:32,840
first yeah, it even crossed
my mind that he'd been neuro'd,

615
00:42:36,125 --> 00:42:38,687
but then oh, about nine
glasses of wine it came to me,

616
00:42:38,688 --> 00:42:41,632
andre is just as conflicted
about what we do as i am.

617
00:42:43,312 --> 00:42:45,312
Only difference is,
he can't say it.

618
00:42:46,501 --> 00:42:47,501
He can't show it.

619
00:42:48,624 --> 00:42:50,735
With his one simple
beautiful gesture,

620
00:42:52,124 --> 00:42:54,290
agent mcbride just
became an open book.

621
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,111
Good-bye simon,
i'll miss you

622
00:42:59,937 --> 00:43:02,381
and don't even think about
screwing me over.
