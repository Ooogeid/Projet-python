00:00:00,716 --> 00:00:02,029
<i>Previously on Nip/Tuck...</i>

2
00:00:02,207 --> 00:00:04,633
Sean McNamara, you are
the new star of Hearts'n Scalpels!

3
00:00:05,025 --> 00:00:08,154
Sean McNamara is sexy and vulnerable,

4
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:11,222
so you're gonna be seeing a lot more
scenes like this Hearts'n Scalpels.

5
00:00:11,382 --> 00:00:13,975
I made some fruitcake.
It's sort of a peace offering.

6
00:00:17,019 --> 00:00:19,731
So tell me, what exactly does
a fluffer of your caliber do?

7
00:00:20,308 --> 00:00:21,900
I got N.G.U.

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,943
That means I gave it to you.

9
00:00:24,103 --> 00:00:26,514
Look me in the eyes and tell me
you're not attracted to me.

10
00:00:26,634 --> 00:00:28,254
- I am attracted to you.
- I love her,

11
00:00:28,374 --> 00:00:30,086
and there's nothing you can do about it.

12
00:00:30,206 --> 00:00:32,327
- Ava's a man.
- Want a drink?

13
00:00:32,487 --> 00:00:36,081
You got a goddamn dick.
I'm not gay! OK?! I'm not into that!

14
00:00:36,393 --> 00:00:38,037
Is that a swastika on it?

15
00:00:38,419 --> 00:00:40,959
I'm not a nazi, Matt, but I am a purist.

16
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:43,004
The Tech works, Matt.

17
00:00:43,164 --> 00:00:44,756
You just gotta trust it.

18
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:45,716
Married?

19
00:00:45,836 --> 00:00:47,550
Matt and I exchanged
our vows 3 days ago.

20
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,135
I never loved you, Matt.

21
00:00:49,295 --> 00:00:51,513
I told you I did, but I lied.

22
00:00:54,342 --> 00:00:57,727
I'm Rachel Ben Natan,
your burn rehabilitation counselor.

23
00:00:57,887 --> 00:00:59,408
I'm here to assist you.

24
00:01:00,336 --> 00:01:02,440
Season 5 Episode 13
<i>August Walden</i>

25
00:01:05,317 --> 00:01:06,443
Hey, listen to this.

26
00:01:06,605 --> 00:01:09,239
"Hearts'n Scalpels
has sunk to a new low.

27
00:01:09,623 --> 00:01:12,135
What was once a mildly
interesting melodrama

28
00:01:12,255 --> 00:01:16,037
has now replaced its sole
charismatic player, Aidan Stone,

29
00:01:16,491 --> 00:01:19,624
with the Milquetoast Dr. Sean Mcnamara.

30
00:01:20,054 --> 00:01:23,336
While Stone does the requisite
Hollywood star turn in rehab,

31
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,905
Mcnamara ruins the Rome that he built.

32
00:01:27,025 --> 00:01:30,712
He's so dull as Dr. Peter Casey,
the best thing I can say

33
00:01:30,976 --> 00:01:33,495
is that watching him
is a cure for insomnia,

34
00:01:33,615 --> 00:01:35,938
or maybe he's the answer
to global warming,

35
00:01:36,058 --> 00:01:39,109
for soon televisions
around the nation will go dark."

36
00:01:39,377 --> 00:01:41,742
Oh, my God. I am so glad
that I took that

37
00:01:41,862 --> 00:01:43,678
out of the lobby
before Sean got to see it.

38
00:01:43,798 --> 00:01:45,066
Let me look at this thing.

39
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:49,074
"And I'm not yet speaking of
Mcnamara's abilities as an actor.

40
00:01:49,194 --> 00:01:51,477
I can't get past the face,
or should I say cardboard box

41
00:01:51,597 --> 00:01:54,469
on shoulders, a puddle of muddy water,
a jellyfish without the sting?

42
00:01:54,589 --> 00:01:58,510
My only wish is that
he turn that scalpel on himself.

43
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,957
Perhaps a scar could bring
some character to that

44
00:02:01,117 --> 00:02:04,358
brown paper bag Mcnamara calls a head."

45
00:02:06,383 --> 00:02:08,437
- What are you reading?
- Oh, eh... Nothing.

46
00:02:08,557 --> 00:02:09,924
Um, is your 10:00 here?

47
00:02:10,084 --> 00:02:12,988
August Walden's review
of Hearts'n Scalpels

48
00:02:13,108 --> 00:02:15,158
in Entertainment Weekly.

49
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,932
Guess he doesn't like me very much.

50
00:02:18,123 --> 00:02:19,780
You are very handsome, Sean,

51
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,436
and Walden doesn't like anybody.

52
00:02:21,596 --> 00:02:24,272
He said that James Gandolfini
looked like a scrotum with legs.

53
00:02:24,432 --> 00:02:26,161
If you're gonna be a TV star, buddy boy,

54
00:02:26,281 --> 00:02:28,860
you're gonna have to get a thick skin
about this kind of stuff.

55
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,146
Yeah, you're right.

56
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,323
- I'll see you in the consult.
- All right.

57
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,330
- What?
- You know what.

58
00:02:59,826 --> 00:03:01,319
Oh, come on, man.

59
00:03:01,762 --> 00:03:04,736
Who gives a crap what some
jealous loser wannabe says?

60
00:03:04,994 --> 00:03:06,394
If it makes you feel better,

61
00:03:06,514 --> 00:03:08,567
just get a good review
and read it 10 times over.

62
00:03:08,687 --> 00:03:10,818
That's what I do on the
odd occasion some sexy lady

63
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,571
declines to do
the horizontal shuffle with me.

64
00:03:14,017 --> 00:03:16,616
I fill my dance card with 10 more.

65
00:03:16,776 --> 00:03:20,036
You've never had anyone tell you
your head looks like a brown paper bag.

66
00:03:20,507 --> 00:03:21,454
True.

67
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,375
Oh, come on. You're a good-looking guy.

68
00:03:25,535 --> 00:03:26,834
I'll take this consult.

69
00:03:26,996 --> 00:03:30,062
You go get yourself some ice cream
or a lollipop or somethin'.

73
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,372
She was over at our house
the other day, you know.

74
00:04:31,564 --> 00:04:32,957
Falafel face?

75
00:04:33,426 --> 00:04:36,239
Yeah. She and Matt were locked
in his room for a couple of hours.

76
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,057
"Locked in his room" locked in his room?

77
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:39,509
Sounded like it.

78
00:04:40,735 --> 00:04:42,502
I didn't hear any talking.

79
00:04:50,703 --> 00:04:51,995
Oh. Hey, guys.

80
00:04:56,993 --> 00:04:58,902
What are you guys doin'over there?

81
00:04:59,022 --> 00:05:01,999
These are all the surgeries
we've performed on Rachel.

82
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,938
6 of them. Can you tell a difference?

83
00:05:15,499 --> 00:05:16,402
A little.

84
00:05:17,876 --> 00:05:19,238
You're bein'too generous.

85
00:05:19,955 --> 00:05:22,575
We have relieved most of her pain,
given her cheekbones

86
00:05:22,735 --> 00:05:25,912
some definition, and restored
about 60% of her sense of smell.

87
00:05:26,072 --> 00:05:28,476
Otherwise, she looks exactly the same.

88
00:05:29,207 --> 00:05:30,416
What's your point?

89
00:05:30,576 --> 00:05:32,906
The point is she's never gonna
look any better than this.

90
00:05:33,026 --> 00:05:35,477
- Right. And looks are all that matter.
- Of course not.

91
00:05:35,597 --> 00:05:38,500
I'm just gonna say it, all right?
I don't care if she shits solid gold.

92
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:42,387
You can't underestimate the burden that
comes with dating somebody like this.

93
00:05:42,547 --> 00:05:45,004
You two are unbelievable.
She nursed me through my recovery.

94
00:05:45,124 --> 00:05:47,092
She made me feel I was
actually worth something.

95
00:05:47,212 --> 00:05:48,962
- Are you wearing rubbers with her?
- Why?

96
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:51,354
Because you're a perfect
catch for a girl like this.

97
00:05:51,514 --> 00:05:55,083
She forgets to take her pill and you're
trapped for the rest of your life.

98
00:05:55,203 --> 00:05:57,401
- You guys are such assholes.
- Matt, wait.

99
00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:00,130
Matt, you were vulnerable
when you met her.

100
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,051
You just got out of one
bad relationship.

101
00:06:02,171 --> 00:06:04,190
We don't want you
getting buried in another one.

102
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,006
No, you just don't want your son dating

103
00:06:06,126 --> 00:06:08,372
some girl who's walking proof
that you two aren't gods,

104
00:06:08,492 --> 00:06:10,545
that you can't make
everyone look perfect.

105
00:06:10,665 --> 00:06:12,783
You guys have been
messin'with people's faces

106
00:06:12,903 --> 00:06:16,762
for so long that I don't even think
you know what ugly looks like anymore.

107
00:06:23,165 --> 00:06:26,157
Miss Lowell, tell me
what you don't like about yourself.

108
00:06:26,493 --> 00:06:27,515
You're sweet.

109
00:06:28,103 --> 00:06:30,518
No one's ever pretended
not to notice before.

110
00:06:31,597 --> 00:06:33,147
But call me Emme.

111
00:06:34,257 --> 00:06:36,432
If there's one thing
I've learned in this business,

112
00:06:36,552 --> 00:06:39,027
It's not to assume.
So tell me, you want a nose job?

113
00:06:40,995 --> 00:06:44,637
When I first saw your picture online,
I didn't think you'd be so funny.

114
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,179
I like it.

115
00:06:47,299 --> 00:06:49,954
Makes the plane trip out here
even more worthwhile.

116
00:06:51,528 --> 00:06:53,649
So where are you from?
South carolina?

117
00:06:53,769 --> 00:06:56,669
Please. I'm a Jersey girl,
born and raised.

118
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:01,090
Guess we both have the same
sense of humor, huh?

119
00:07:02,352 --> 00:07:05,678
Actually, I'm from Cleveland, Georgia.

120
00:07:05,994 --> 00:07:08,514
It's a tiny, little town in the
smoky mountains up north.

121
00:07:08,874 --> 00:07:11,967
This is my first time travelin'away
from home, if youcan believe it.

122
00:07:12,941 --> 00:07:15,188
I think I'm afraid of flying, too.

123
00:07:15,348 --> 00:07:17,256
Yet you got on a plane
for the first time ever

124
00:07:17,376 --> 00:07:19,334
and came all the way
out here for a consult.

125
00:07:19,454 --> 00:07:20,211
Why?

126
00:07:20,331 --> 00:07:22,737
You're the doctor who set up
the Hedda Grubman fund, right?

127
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,173
Well, I don't have a lot of money,

128
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,335
and when I went on Google
and typed in "free plasticsurgery,"

129
00:07:29,632 --> 00:07:33,164
your name came up and said
you do cases like mine for no pay.

130
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,376
Well, you know, where
birth defects are involved.

131
00:07:41,348 --> 00:07:44,524
Technically what you have
is called naevus flammeus.

132
00:07:44,644 --> 00:07:47,619
It's where the, uh,
deep dilated capillaries, uh,

133
00:07:48,829 --> 00:07:51,445
cause the skin to turn a reddish purple.

134
00:07:51,565 --> 00:07:54,427
It's really more of birthmark

135
00:07:54,547 --> 00:07:56,271
than a skin defect.

136
00:07:56,391 --> 00:07:58,911
It's actually quite common.
One in 3,000 newborns have it.

137
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,525
Not like this, they don't.

138
00:08:02,359 --> 00:08:05,502
The procedure involves
several laser treatments.

139
00:08:05,622 --> 00:08:07,185
I know you flew all the way out here,

140
00:08:07,305 --> 00:08:09,519
but I really have a very long
waiting list right now.

141
00:08:09,643 --> 00:08:13,040
A waitin'list? I've waited 24 years.
I spent all I had just

142
00:08:14,831 --> 00:08:18,215
To get out here, and then
the cab ride from the airport

143
00:08:18,335 --> 00:08:20,677
cost almost as much as the plane.

144
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:25,758
You ever read <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>,
Dr. Troy?

145
00:08:26,203 --> 00:08:27,403
In college, yes.

146
00:08:27,586 --> 00:08:30,638
That's what my mom used to call this,
her scarlet letter,

147
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,601
Said it was the shame she had
to bear for havin'me

148
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:36,679
with some one-night stand.
But it's not just her.

149
00:08:37,493 --> 00:08:41,190
I've never been a ccepted by anyone
my whole life because of this face.

150
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:45,015
That's the real reason
I never left home until now.

151
00:08:47,105 --> 00:08:50,162
And now that I'm here,
I can't go back lookin'like this.

152
00:08:51,403 --> 00:08:52,660
I won't.

153
00:09:06,606 --> 00:09:09,023
You know, when August Walde
gave me my first review,

154
00:09:09,143 --> 00:09:10,942
I ate an entire box of those,

155
00:09:11,062 --> 00:09:13,380
even the kinds with sprinkles,
which I don't even love,

156
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,841
and a half a tray of sausages.

157
00:09:16,252 --> 00:09:18,691
I was so bloated I couldn't
get my costume zipped

158
00:09:18,811 --> 00:09:21,186
After my lunchtime coma.
It was ridiculous.

159
00:09:21,315 --> 00:09:23,758
So this is what this does?
Rips people to shreds?

160
00:09:23,878 --> 00:09:27,133
Yeah. Let's see. Uh,"
the dreary Kate Tinsley brings

161
00:09:27,253 --> 00:09:29,548
to mind a sullen coonhound."

162
00:09:29,668 --> 00:09:32,283
Uh,"her body resembles
that of a butternut squash,

163
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,595
and her speech pattern makes me wonder

164
00:09:34,715 --> 00:09:37,168
if she hasn't yet swallowed
her breakfast kibble."

165
00:09:37,288 --> 00:09:39,247
Yeah. Emblazoned on my brain forever.

166
00:09:39,367 --> 00:09:41,921
I hope you've got some of your
good reviews memorized as well.

167
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,120
Yeah, well, the good ones, you forget.

168
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,251
The bad ones are forever. Ahem.

169
00:09:50,668 --> 00:09:53,010
You learn to live with it, you know.

170
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:56,038
I mean, being in
the spotlight, you, um...

171
00:09:56,338 --> 00:09:59,023
You're asking people to weigh in
on what you look like.

172
00:09:59,647 --> 00:10:01,816
What you can avoid is choosing a lover

173
00:10:01,936 --> 00:10:03,814
who looks at you with a critic's eye.

174
00:10:18,246 --> 00:10:20,609
So, where does this guy live?

175
00:10:21,383 --> 00:10:23,508
Who knows? Maybe one night
I'll get hammered

176
00:10:23,628 --> 00:10:25,925
and show up at his door
and take him out.

177
00:10:26,045 --> 00:10:29,533
Actually he always hangs out
at that coffee shop over on Riverside.

178
00:10:29,782 --> 00:10:32,482
Sits there all day long
typing on his computer.

179
00:10:32,602 --> 00:10:34,602
Of course no one wants to confront him.

180
00:10:34,722 --> 00:10:37,575
Everyone's so scared
of his scathing tongue.

181
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:43,403
You know, you seem like
you're in a good place.

182
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,527
I'm sorry about everything.

183
00:10:48,371 --> 00:10:49,953
I hope we can be friends.

184
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,154
Yeah, we're good.

185
00:10:54,298 --> 00:10:57,066
On one condition. You actuallydo it.

186
00:10:57,186 --> 00:10:59,282
Go to the coffee shop.
Rip the guy a new one

187
00:10:59,402 --> 00:11:00,775
on behalf of actors everywhere

188
00:11:00,895 --> 00:11:03,802
and record it on your cellphone
so I can watch it over and over again.

189
00:11:03,922 --> 00:11:05,543
- It's not really my style.
- Really?

190
00:11:05,703 --> 00:11:09,328
Milquetoast? "His face
looks like a cardboard box

191
00:11:09,548 --> 00:11:10,714
on shoulders,

192
00:11:10,876 --> 00:11:13,951
a," um, "puddle ofmuddy water."
Um, "jellyfish

193
00:11:14,071 --> 00:11:15,207
Without the sting."

194
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,943
You gonna let that go?

195
00:11:19,589 --> 00:11:21,302
Puddle of muddy water.

196
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,718
Here's your double espresso,
mr. Walden.

197
00:12:06,263 --> 00:12:07,563
August Walden?

198
00:12:09,042 --> 00:12:10,129
Have we met?

199
00:12:11,918 --> 00:12:13,151
Not officially.

200
00:12:14,909 --> 00:12:17,171
I'm the puddle of muddy water which

201
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:19,812
can only evoke yawns
from the audience.

202
00:12:21,047 --> 00:12:21,869
Yes.

203
00:12:22,233 --> 00:12:25,419
And a memorable appearance off-screen
as well as on.

204
00:12:29,527 --> 00:12:30,544
You know,

205
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,182
I came here

206
00:12:32,915 --> 00:12:35,966
with the intention of getting
some sort of apology from you

207
00:12:36,126 --> 00:12:37,885
for the way you just attack people,

208
00:12:39,028 --> 00:12:40,202
But now I get it.

209
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,765
Now I understand why you do it.

210
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:45,643
I do it because i am paid to advise
the general public

211
00:12:46,425 --> 00:12:49,397
of what and whom is worthy
of their attention and admiration.

212
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,108
Just cut the shit, will you?

213
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,984
You're so eaten up with jealousy,

214
00:12:55,104 --> 00:12:58,679
so full of self-contempt because of
your own extraordinary ugliness,

215
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:00,241
You have to make others pay.

216
00:13:00,499 --> 00:13:02,451
I shouldn't be asking you
for an apology.

217
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:06,425
I should be apologizing to you for
what you have to go through every day

218
00:13:06,545 --> 00:13:08,141
Looking the way you do.

219
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,587
If only making other people feel badly
could make you feel better.

220
00:13:21,146 --> 00:13:24,318
<i>Hey, baby, it's Christian.
Just confirming lunch today.</i>

221
00:14:24,004 --> 00:14:25,378
Thought you'd gone.

222
00:14:26,111 --> 00:14:27,233
I would have.

223
00:14:29,922 --> 00:14:33,834
Who was she, someone you picked up
at the carwash, the drugstore?

224
00:14:36,104 --> 00:14:37,046
Gas station.

225
00:14:40,721 --> 00:14:44,349
You really don't give
a shit about me at all, do you?

226
00:14:50,906 --> 00:14:53,566
For years, i've fantasized
about being with you.

227
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:55,467
It's just

228
00:14:56,669 --> 00:14:58,642
In my head, you were so perfect.

229
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:03,091
But in life, with all this messy

230
00:15:04,948 --> 00:15:08,562
pain and illness
and goddamn regret, it's just...

231
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,316
It's not the same,

232
00:15:13,783 --> 00:15:14,611
is it?

233
00:15:28,492 --> 00:15:30,793
I'm sorry. I can't change who I am.

234
00:15:31,439 --> 00:15:32,393
I tried.

235
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:38,182
Yeah, you've been in my head
for a long time, too,

236
00:15:39,262 --> 00:15:41,646
always there tempting me.

237
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,905
Only, in my head,

238
00:15:46,204 --> 00:15:47,519
you were beautiful,

239
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:51,579
deep down, you had a kind,
caring soul.

240
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:58,351
And only now do I see just

241
00:15:58,471 --> 00:16:00,588
how ugly you really are.

242
00:16:06,783 --> 00:16:09,388
Oh, my God.
What a mistake I've made.

243
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,152
I had a second chance with Olivia...
Kind, caring

244
00:16:16,452 --> 00:16:18,856
in sickness and in health, you know.

245
00:16:21,716 --> 00:16:23,474
And i've blown it,

246
00:16:24,448 --> 00:16:26,155
wasting all my time on you.

247
00:16:29,632 --> 00:16:31,243
It's not like I don't love you.

248
00:16:37,924 --> 00:16:40,961
I just want us to be friends.

249
00:16:41,254 --> 00:16:42,217
Friends?

250
00:16:46,036 --> 00:16:49,194
You have donea lot of things
in your time, Christian,

251
00:16:49,965 --> 00:16:51,611
but to do this to me now,

252
00:16:52,821 --> 00:16:54,808
when I need you so much.

253
00:16:56,903 --> 00:16:59,231
Maybe one day I'll be able to forgive,

254
00:17:00,382 --> 00:17:02,967
but I know that I'll never forget.

255
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:21,715
Tell me what youdon't like
about yourself,

256
00:17:21,969 --> 00:17:23,504
Although it's sadly obvious.

257
00:17:23,761 --> 00:17:26,840
I thought it would only befair to write
a review of my appearance.

258
00:17:28,201 --> 00:17:29,593
I'd like to hear it.

259
00:17:32,381 --> 00:17:35,411
"In all my years, I've never met
an uglier human being"

260
00:17:35,531 --> 00:17:36,892
"than August Walden."

261
00:17:37,175 --> 00:17:41,021
"Though calling him human could be
construed as an insult to the phylum."

262
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:43,190
Please, continue.

263
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,786
"Below the mating caterpillars
Walden calls brows,"

264
00:17:45,906 --> 00:17:47,861
"two extremely far sighted eyes droop"

265
00:17:48,021 --> 00:17:50,560
"like a basset hound's
under the pull of gravity."

266
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,784
"In fact, his entire face looks
as if it's been pulled"

267
00:17:53,904 --> 00:17:56,622
"and stretched by a hyperactive toddler
playing with Silly putty."

268
00:17:56,742 --> 00:18:00,374
All right, look, the other day
I was may be a bit too harsh.

269
00:18:00,683 --> 00:18:03,278
- If i'm the reason you're here...
- You are the reason i'm here,

270
00:18:03,525 --> 00:18:06,632
I am thankful for your words.

271
00:18:08,957 --> 00:18:10,225
You were right

272
00:18:11,406 --> 00:18:13,906
and frankly the first person
to say it to my...

273
00:18:14,646 --> 00:18:15,855
horrific face.

274
00:18:16,254 --> 00:18:19,268
I have been isolating myself
for years behind this...

275
00:18:19,607 --> 00:18:21,087
Halloween mask,

276
00:18:22,467 --> 00:18:25,314
Scaring away everyone with
whom i come in contact,

277
00:18:26,728 --> 00:18:27,872
In particular,

278
00:18:28,618 --> 00:18:30,948
a young lady of whom i have grown fond,

279
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:32,158
a lithe

280
00:18:32,397 --> 00:18:34,969
beauty of a barista at the cafe.

281
00:18:35,694 --> 00:18:39,621
Every day, doctor, I am there
trying to connect with her,

282
00:18:40,473 --> 00:18:43,417
Yet unable to hold her gaze
for more than a mere moment.

283
00:18:43,685 --> 00:18:46,170
Can you help me connect
with her, dr. McNamara?

284
00:18:51,994 --> 00:18:53,343
What are you doing?

285
00:18:53,503 --> 00:18:54,994
I told you to stay in bed.

286
00:18:55,114 --> 00:18:57,530
Since the surgery was free,
I figured i had to do something

287
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:58,515
to pay you back.

288
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,765
I cleaned the bathroom, too.

289
00:19:01,801 --> 00:19:04,467
Someone does you a favor,
you do one back.

290
00:19:07,155 --> 00:19:08,686
Well, take a break.

291
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,028
Sit down.
I need to see how you're healing.

292
00:19:14,292 --> 00:19:16,411
Don't you think it'd be better
if you found a plastic surgeon

293
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:18,285
you didn't just trash
in your magazine?

294
00:19:19,927 --> 00:19:23,165
If I did, I couldn'tcorrect
the error of my ways.

295
00:19:24,236 --> 00:19:27,475
After the surgery, i will happily write
another critique

296
00:19:27,595 --> 00:19:30,244
of Hearts'n Scalpels
and specifically you,

297
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:34,259
which I can assure you
you will appreciate more than the last.

298
00:19:34,419 --> 00:19:37,805
Maybe my face isn't a cardboard box
on shoulders?

299
00:19:37,965 --> 00:19:39,844
I was thinking more
along the lines of

300
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:42,246
"reminiscent of a young Gary Cooper."

301
00:19:44,229 --> 00:19:46,953
You know what the kids used to
call me in school?

302
00:19:47,289 --> 00:19:49,719
Swamp thing. Isn't that awful?

303
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,635
The boys wouldn't go near me
in High School 'cause of

304
00:19:52,755 --> 00:19:54,988
how I looked. I never even had
a real boyfriend,

305
00:19:55,108 --> 00:19:57,384
Though I did meet
this one guy online.

306
00:19:59,195 --> 00:20:00,510
Somethin'wrong?

307
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,281
No. It's...

308
00:20:04,212 --> 00:20:05,262
Come here.

309
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:13,788
Oh, my god.

310
00:20:13,908 --> 00:20:16,594
There are ethical questions
to me performing your surgery,

311
00:20:16,714 --> 00:20:17,845
Conflicts of interest.

312
00:20:18,005 --> 00:20:19,927
If you have an opening, doctor,

313
00:20:20,047 --> 00:20:22,015
I am ready to go
under the knife immediately.

314
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:24,268
We have an opening at 2:00.

315
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,984
I could really usesome lipstick,
couldn't i?

316
00:21:05,552 --> 00:21:08,164
Emme, you're beautiful.

317
00:21:23,634 --> 00:21:24,620
Hey, Mattie.

318
00:21:25,858 --> 00:21:27,956
- How you doin'?
- I'm doin'all right.

319
00:21:28,278 --> 00:21:29,625
Nice flowers.

320
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:33,462
Thanks. They're for my girlfriend.
She's in recovery.

321
00:21:34,432 --> 00:21:35,797
Emme, this is Matt.

322
00:21:35,957 --> 00:21:37,164
- Hi.
- Hi.

323
00:21:37,284 --> 00:21:39,292
Emme just had a port stain removed
from her face.

324
00:21:39,412 --> 00:21:40,880
Doesn't she look great?

325
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:42,763
Sure. Congratulations.

326
00:21:42,923 --> 00:21:45,390
We're going to Neiman's to celebrate.
You should come with, we can have lunch.

327
00:21:46,025 --> 00:21:48,769
Yeah, no, thanks.
I'm go **************

328
00:21:49,487 --> 00:21:50,287
Fun.

329
00:21:52,218 --> 00:21:55,525
Emme's new in town, so maybe
you guys should **********

330
00:21:55,685 --> 00:21:57,284
and could try the sights.

331
00:21:59,957 --> 00:22:01,907
- Stop it, Christian
- Stop what?

332
00:22:04,492 --> 00:22:05,835
Look, Emme,

333
00:22:06,712 --> 00:22:08,894
you look great,
and I'm really happy for you,

334
00:22:09,014 --> 00:22:12,250
but contrary to some people opinion,
I have a girlfriend who I love very much

335
00:22:15,288 --> 00:22:16,713
"Learning Hebrew."

336
00:22:17,309 --> 00:22:19,633
Yeah. I take courts
at the jewish community center.

337
00:22:20,001 --> 00:22:21,009
Jesus.

338
00:22:21,482 --> 00:22:24,175
You'll take an of kool-aid
a girl feeds you, huh?

339
00:22:24,295 --> 00:22:25,616
It was nice meeting you.

340
00:22:32,653 --> 00:22:33,510
Honey?

341
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,069
Honey?

342
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,109
How are you? I've been so worried.

343
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,841
Oh, my god. You look so sick.

344
00:22:52,961 --> 00:22:55,262
I know how terrible I look.

345
00:22:55,382 --> 00:22:59,382
And it's funny, you know, because
I've always relied on a certain beauty,

346
00:23:00,385 --> 00:23:02,341
and it's really superficial, I know,

347
00:23:02,461 --> 00:23:06,221
But without it,
I just... I don't even know who I am.

348
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:14,896
Just don't get upset, please.

349
00:23:15,318 --> 00:23:16,648
I think you're the most

350
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,391
beautiful person I have ever known

351
00:23:22,063 --> 00:23:23,754
in every single way.

352
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:27,376
I've really missed you, Julia.

353
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:31,900
I'm not gonna let anything happen
to you. You're my angel.

354
00:23:34,065 --> 00:23:35,917
I've been having
an affair with Christian.

355
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,124
It's over, finally

356
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:50,390
and for the last time.

357
00:23:54,284 --> 00:23:56,539
I feel like I've been
in a fever dream.

358
00:23:56,659 --> 00:23:58,302
Well, a nightmare, really.

359
00:24:02,757 --> 00:24:05,637
I just don't know
how you can forgive me,

360
00:24:06,522 --> 00:24:08,422
let alone love me.

361
00:24:08,542 --> 00:24:10,285
No use getting angry.

362
00:24:11,337 --> 00:24:13,415
We gotta put that energy into action.

363
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,195
We're gonna send that hair

364
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:17,375
to a lab in Westbury, Virginia.

365
00:24:17,495 --> 00:24:20,170
They've made some amazing
diagnostics for me in the past.

366
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:23,810
I have been to every doctor in L.A.,

367
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:26,426
and no one seems to know
what's wrong with me.

368
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,886
Western doctors.

369
00:24:28,978 --> 00:24:30,892
God, they all have their narrow,

370
00:24:31,012 --> 00:24:33,433
little focus.
No one's looking at the big picture.

371
00:24:33,593 --> 00:24:35,811
We're gonna find out
what's wrong with you.

372
00:24:36,745 --> 00:24:37,814
I promise.

373
00:24:53,662 --> 00:24:56,257
Julia, would you like
honey in your tea?

374
00:24:56,671 --> 00:24:58,041
No, thanks.

375
00:25:00,164 --> 00:25:03,299
You know, you...
you really have been a doll, Eden.

376
00:25:04,106 --> 00:25:07,812
I know we've had our differences,
but frankly,

377
00:25:07,932 --> 00:25:10,554
You've been the only one
who's lifted a finger for me

378
00:25:10,714 --> 00:25:13,048
since Olivia hasn't been here.

379
00:25:14,912 --> 00:25:16,990
I know I act up sometimes,

380
00:25:17,572 --> 00:25:18,740
but you're sick.

381
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,768
Kind of takes the fun out of it.

382
00:25:23,096 --> 00:25:25,443
There's one more piece of fruitcake
in the fridge. You want me to get it?

383
00:25:28,398 --> 00:25:31,320
Sure. It seems to be the only thing
I can keep down.

384
00:25:44,706 --> 00:25:45,755
<i>Follicle Analysis</i>

385
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,718
<i>Hydrargyria, exposure to
high dosages of mercury</i>

386
00:25:52,922 --> 00:25:55,265
<i>FDA exposure limit: 1 PPM.

387
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,768

<i>kidney function

389
00:26:01,262 --> 00:26:03,732
I really have to bake you
another of these.

390
00:26:03,892 --> 00:26:05,442
Who knew you loved fruitcake so much?

391
00:26:06,874 --> 00:26:07,944
Don't be shy.

392
00:26:08,104 --> 00:26:09,696
You're the only one who eats it.

393
00:26:12,713 --> 00:26:14,051
I think i'll...

394
00:26:14,321 --> 00:26:16,453
take it to my room for later.

395
00:26:29,347 --> 00:26:32,156
Ready for my close-up, Dr. McNamara?

396
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:34,179
Sometimes we make

397
00:26:34,339 --> 00:26:37,110
miraculous improvements
with a single surgery,

398
00:26:37,694 --> 00:26:39,548
and in othermore serious cases,

399
00:26:39,668 --> 00:26:42,242
we hope for incremental improvements.

400
00:26:43,612 --> 00:26:47,612
It may take a few more surgeries
than I anticipated.

401
00:26:48,193 --> 00:26:51,112
- I'm not going to do any more.
- Why not? I thought you...

402
00:26:51,272 --> 00:26:53,804
No, Matt was the one who kept
pushing and pushing, but

403
00:26:54,472 --> 00:26:57,337
- my plans have changed.
- Sean, our 11:00's early.

404
00:26:57,457 --> 00:26:59,037
- She's in my office.
- Dr. Troy,

405
00:26:59,197 --> 00:27:02,646
in case I don't see you again, I just
wanted to thank you for all you've done.

406
00:27:02,971 --> 00:27:06,044
I'm leaving, going back to Israel.

407
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,339
Mattie didn't mention
anything about that.

408
00:27:09,667 --> 00:27:10,882
I haven't told him yet.

409
00:27:13,691 --> 00:27:15,971
He's a nice boy,
but he's very confused.

410
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:18,098
I don't understand. You and Matt,

411
00:27:18,258 --> 00:27:20,093
- he thinks...
- I know what he thinks.

412
00:27:20,213 --> 00:27:22,727
He thinks I am the answer,

413
00:27:22,887 --> 00:27:24,477
that judaism is the answer.

414
00:27:24,597 --> 00:27:27,899
He goes from one thing to another.
The answer's always out there somewhere.

415
00:27:28,059 --> 00:27:30,193
He needs to go inside.
That's the only place it is.

416
00:27:30,353 --> 00:27:33,094
Don't you think you should
be telling Matt about this?

417
00:27:33,479 --> 00:27:34,580
Tell me what?

418
00:27:40,822 --> 00:27:44,722
We have a consultation.
Stick around after, and we'll talk, OK?

419
00:27:51,033 --> 00:27:52,465
You look good.

420
00:27:56,636 --> 00:27:57,929
What's wrong?

421
00:27:58,223 --> 00:27:59,808
I'm going home, Matt,

422
00:28:00,776 --> 00:28:02,017
back to Tel Aviv.

423
00:28:02,584 --> 00:28:04,269
Why? I don't understand.

424
00:28:19,914 --> 00:28:22,603
It is not right between us, Matt.

425
00:28:23,449 --> 00:28:24,400
I just...

426
00:28:26,555 --> 00:28:27,876
I don't love you.

427
00:28:34,216 --> 00:28:35,925
I thought what we shared...

428
00:28:36,085 --> 00:28:37,621
Was lovely, yes,

429
00:28:39,439 --> 00:28:41,723
but I'm not attracted to you.

430
00:28:43,834 --> 00:28:45,760
I'm so sorry, but I'm not.

431
00:28:50,197 --> 00:28:52,252
You're not attracted to me?

432
00:28:53,739 --> 00:28:57,250
Attraction has nothing to do
with what the person looks like.

433
00:28:58,033 --> 00:29:00,875
It's an inner chemistry.
It's there, or it isn't.

434
00:29:03,607 --> 00:29:05,747
I'm sorry, but...

435
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:08,750
have you looked in a mirror lately?

436
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:13,630
I know what you must think.

437
00:29:14,146 --> 00:29:17,842
You think because I am not beautiful,
I have no right to be picky.

438
00:29:18,002 --> 00:29:20,220
Perhaps you thought
you could avoid getting hurt

439
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,097
by choosing someone
too desperate to reject you.

440
00:29:22,257 --> 00:29:25,216
No. You know what?
Screw you, OK? I mean,

441
00:29:25,884 --> 00:29:28,857
you and all your bullshit
about how looks don't matter,

442
00:29:28,977 --> 00:29:31,022
like you're some poster girl
for inner strength.

443
00:29:31,182 --> 00:29:33,755
You won't find the parts of yourself
that are missing in me.

444
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:35,443
You need to look inside.

445
00:29:35,603 --> 00:29:38,071
Only then will you be able
to express love instead of need.

446
00:29:38,231 --> 00:29:41,616
Need? I don't need you, Rachel.
I felt sorry for you,

447
00:29:42,242 --> 00:29:45,620
Because the only chemical reaction
you're gonna get from a man is pity.

448
00:29:45,941 --> 00:29:48,090
Here. These are for you. Enjoy 'em.

449
00:29:55,901 --> 00:29:57,625
<i>... Dream come true.</i>

450
00:29:57,745 --> 00:30:00,589
<i>I'm not... No, you're the one
living with regrets,</i>

451
00:30:00,709 --> 00:30:01,611
not me.

452
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:13,940
Hey, everything all right?

453
00:30:15,955 --> 00:30:18,027
My mother. She can be a little,

454
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:20,321
overprotective, I guess.

455
00:30:24,324 --> 00:30:26,327
Do you wanna go grab some lunch?

456
00:30:42,973 --> 00:30:46,585
There was no way I thought
you could do that again.

457
00:30:47,365 --> 00:30:49,373
I didn't think I could
do it again either.

458
00:30:51,364 --> 00:30:55,364
Man, I have never felt a connection
like this before. It's amazing.

459
00:30:56,835 --> 00:30:58,702
It's like we just fit together.

460
00:30:59,463 --> 00:31:01,446
Our bodies, our skin.

461
00:31:01,606 --> 00:31:02,966
It's amazing.

462
00:31:07,376 --> 00:31:10,663
God, I always wanted
my first time to be special like this.

463
00:31:11,517 --> 00:31:12,707
Your first time?

464
00:31:13,584 --> 00:31:15,345
I just took your virginity?

465
00:31:20,389 --> 00:31:21,716
You're not upset, are you?

466
00:31:22,656 --> 00:31:23,678
Upset?

467
00:31:24,373 --> 00:31:26,427
Are you kiddin'me? I'm honored.

468
00:31:27,506 --> 00:31:28,716
I'm honored.

469
00:31:34,305 --> 00:31:36,697
These last days
have just been so amazing.

470
00:31:37,678 --> 00:31:39,817
Let's see. First, I met my father,

471
00:31:40,257 --> 00:31:42,473
and then I got my face fixed,

472
00:31:42,593 --> 00:31:45,613
- and then I met you.
- You met your father?

473
00:31:46,192 --> 00:31:48,300
And I look just like him, I think.

474
00:31:48,716 --> 00:31:51,412
And we have the same sense of humor.
It's amazing,

475
00:31:51,572 --> 00:31:53,915
- just amazing.
- Who is he?

476
00:31:54,608 --> 00:31:56,459
My plastic surgeon, Dr. Troy.

477
00:32:17,682 --> 00:32:20,024
They still saved my same table
for me, dr. McNamara.

478
00:32:20,582 --> 00:32:23,347
Now I'm crossing my fingers
that a certain someone

479
00:32:23,467 --> 00:32:26,040
- bothers me constantly.
- Yeah. Where is she?

480
00:32:30,132 --> 00:32:32,787
- She's very pretty.
- The apple of my eye.

481
00:32:36,158 --> 00:32:38,460
Welcome back, Mr. Walden.

482
00:32:39,801 --> 00:32:41,713
Almost didn't recognize you.

483
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:44,799
We've got a fresh batch
of pumpkin muffins today.

484
00:32:46,151 --> 00:32:49,053
And by the way, thanks.
You changed my life.

485
00:32:49,638 --> 00:32:50,513
Is that so?

486
00:32:51,247 --> 00:32:54,392
Well, I was in an episode
of NCIS that you reviewed.

487
00:32:54,945 --> 00:32:58,379
You said that you'd rather clean
cat piss out of the carpet

488
00:32:58,499 --> 00:33:00,398
than watch another moment
of my acting,

489
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:03,397
that my portrayal
of a kidnapping rapist

490
00:33:03,517 --> 00:33:05,361
was worse than the crime committed.

491
00:33:05,521 --> 00:33:08,077
Then you're lucky
you still have this job.

492
00:33:09,021 --> 00:33:11,242
You killed my dream.

493
00:33:12,737 --> 00:33:14,878
Just when I was startin'to
pick up momentum,

494
00:33:14,998 --> 00:33:17,785
my recurring role
on the show was dropped.

495
00:33:17,905 --> 00:33:20,666
My agent left me. I don't make
enough money here to make rent.

496
00:33:20,786 --> 00:33:23,004
I have to go back to Oregon
and live with my mother.

497
00:33:23,164 --> 00:33:24,520
And I am to blame?

498
00:33:25,061 --> 00:33:27,759
You need to take responsibility
for your lack of artistry,

499
00:33:28,408 --> 00:33:29,969
not to mention insight.

500
00:33:32,661 --> 00:33:36,142
I do. I take full responsibility
for my career and for this.

501
00:33:42,295 --> 00:33:44,369
OK, so according to California law,

502
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:46,569
what we did was technically
not illegal and

503
00:33:47,295 --> 00:33:49,781
not that crazy either, OK?

504
00:33:49,941 --> 00:33:51,366
Here. Come here. Look.

505
00:33:55,006 --> 00:33:56,540
What's this?

506
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:00,113
It's a blog devoted to couples
who are related.

507
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,796
"Like everyone else here, my brother
and I are not just having sex,"

508
00:34:04,956 --> 00:34:06,087
"we are in love."

509
00:34:06,207 --> 00:34:08,587
"Tom and I have been together
for two years and feel that"

510
00:34:08,707 --> 00:34:12,707
"because we are related, have a stronger
bond than any other non-incest couple."

511
00:34:13,976 --> 00:34:16,653
"For us, incest is the best
of all worlds."

512
00:34:19,083 --> 00:34:22,678
Yeah. They go on to talk about
this scientific study that was done

513
00:34:22,798 --> 00:34:26,401
showing that, you know, siblings
who are raised together develop

514
00:34:26,561 --> 00:34:29,070
this innate sexual repulsion, but

515
00:34:29,381 --> 00:34:32,323
you know, when they're
separated andr aised apart

516
00:34:32,586 --> 00:34:35,827
like us, uh, you know,
they don't have that.

517
00:34:36,996 --> 00:34:39,330
So there was no way we'd feel
like what we did was wrong.

518
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:41,541
And apparently in other
cultures around the world,

519
00:34:41,661 --> 00:34:43,345
they don't have
a problem with it either.

520
00:34:43,465 --> 00:34:45,373
But mother nature has a say.

521
00:34:46,104 --> 00:34:48,256
You get freak babies
if you inbreed, right?

522
00:34:59,103 --> 00:35:02,566
We used a condom.
It's OK. We're fine.

523
00:35:03,707 --> 00:35:05,982
- I was born damaged like that.
- No.

524
00:35:06,142 --> 00:35:09,488
You don't know how hard it is,
how people look at you.

525
00:35:10,102 --> 00:35:13,045
- I don't want that to happen again.
- It won't. I promise.

526
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:18,911
Does that mean we have to stop?

527
00:35:21,426 --> 00:35:23,023
'Cause you don't want to?

528
00:35:25,008 --> 00:35:26,016
Oh, man.

529
00:35:33,344 --> 00:35:34,647
This is wrong.

530
00:35:38,381 --> 00:35:39,214
Look,

531
00:35:41,707 --> 00:35:45,241
only if your mom's right, OK?
What if she's wrong?

532
00:35:45,754 --> 00:35:48,733
What if we're not related at all?
It's all gonna be fine.

533
00:35:53,731 --> 00:35:55,620
Mattie. Emme.

534
00:35:57,091 --> 00:35:59,181
How long you guys been here?

535
00:36:00,362 --> 00:36:01,660
About an hour.

536
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:04,248
Emme's never seen the ocean before,

537
00:36:04,408 --> 00:36:07,193
so I thought this'd be
the best place to check it out.

538
00:36:07,751 --> 00:36:08,631
Great.

539
00:36:11,279 --> 00:36:15,092
Well, you guys are gettin'to know each
other, so, I'll get out of your way.

540
00:36:16,643 --> 00:36:19,508
Actually, can I talk
to you for a second?

541
00:36:20,765 --> 00:36:21,798
Of course.

542
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:25,457
- She's a great girl, huh? Huh?
- Yeah.

543
00:36:28,563 --> 00:36:32,193
Look. There's somethin'that
you need to know,

544
00:36:32,353 --> 00:36:34,202
and it may come as a bit of a shock.

545
00:36:34,322 --> 00:36:35,130
Sure.

546
00:36:41,326 --> 00:36:42,286
Emme...

547
00:36:44,209 --> 00:36:47,827
Emme forgot her birth control
at her house, and...

548
00:36:48,213 --> 00:36:51,234
- We need an emergency prescription.
- Of course. Of course.

549
00:36:51,354 --> 00:36:53,214
I'm just glad you're being safe.

550
00:36:55,607 --> 00:36:57,635
Pretty great what happened
to Walden, huh?

551
00:36:58,439 --> 00:37:00,012
No. It's not pretty great.

552
00:37:00,172 --> 00:37:02,598
The man suffered second
and third-degree burns.

553
00:37:02,718 --> 00:37:04,801
Gonna need 4 or 5 painful operations.

554
00:37:04,921 --> 00:37:06,932
His sight might be compromised forever.

555
00:37:07,052 --> 00:37:08,521
Jeez. Mr. Sensitive.

556
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:13,025
What, you don't think
he deserves it just a little bit?

557
00:37:14,715 --> 00:37:16,320
No. I don't.

558
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:20,616
And that kid who did it is going
to jail, So it's not a happy ending.

559
00:37:21,143 --> 00:37:23,160
Hello, darlings.

560
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,133
May I join the wake?

561
00:37:27,099 --> 00:37:29,000
You have read it, right?

562
00:37:30,399 --> 00:37:31,878
Read what?

563
00:37:33,366 --> 00:37:37,299
Well, I never take these things
too seriously, but...

564
00:37:37,668 --> 00:37:40,428
We were just skewered
in the Los Angeles Times.

565
00:37:42,294 --> 00:37:44,760
Perhaps you shouldn't see it.

566
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:48,206
Give it backwhen you're done.
And, darlings,

567
00:37:48,326 --> 00:37:50,229
don't let this affect today's work.

568
00:37:50,389 --> 00:37:53,988
Sean, you are not flat and monotone,
and, Kate, darling,

569
00:37:54,108 --> 00:37:56,618
you are not... "A lumpy zero."

570
00:38:00,237 --> 00:38:01,967
- I'll split it with you.
- Get your own.

571
00:38:02,087 --> 00:38:04,637
It's the only thing
keeping me from suicide.

572
00:38:06,203 --> 00:38:07,201
I see.

573
00:38:08,694 --> 00:38:09,774
Thank you.

574
00:38:13,104 --> 00:38:16,093
Hey, Julia.
I made some of my healing tea.

575
00:38:16,213 --> 00:38:17,715
Think it's really startin'to work.

576
00:38:17,875 --> 00:38:20,384
I feel like you're gettin'better.
Don't you?

577
00:38:25,043 --> 00:38:26,351
You drink it.

578
00:38:27,591 --> 00:38:29,767
Why would I drink it?
You're the one who's been sick.

579
00:38:29,887 --> 00:38:30,937
Thanks to you.

580
00:38:36,265 --> 00:38:38,235
I don't know what you mean, Julia.

581
00:38:38,668 --> 00:38:39,904
Don't you?

582
00:38:41,357 --> 00:38:43,405
You've been poisoning me

583
00:38:44,593 --> 00:38:46,801
with all your soups

584
00:38:46,921 --> 00:38:49,455
and the teas and that fruitcake.

585
00:38:51,336 --> 00:38:54,043
I think whatever you have
is starting to seep into your brain.

586
00:38:55,017 --> 00:38:56,509
Yes, it has.

587
00:38:58,216 --> 00:39:00,299
Mercury poisoning does that to you.

588
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:02,718
It kills the organs

589
00:39:02,878 --> 00:39:05,141
and destroys the brain cells.

590
00:39:08,206 --> 00:39:11,018
I just got off the phone
with the toxicology lab.

591
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,004
I sent them
that last piece of fruitcake.

592
00:39:15,217 --> 00:39:18,739
It had an 80% contamination
rate for mercury.

593
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:23,030
I have proof of
what you've been doing to me.

594
00:39:24,623 --> 00:39:28,319
You made a mistake
in underestimating me, Eden.

595
00:39:28,439 --> 00:39:29,912
You are going to jail.

596
00:39:30,072 --> 00:39:32,435
You area sick, sick girl,

597
00:39:32,555 --> 00:39:34,480
and you need to be locked up!

598
00:39:57,238 --> 00:39:58,459
I've had fun.

599
00:39:59,671 --> 00:40:00,634
You know,

600
00:40:01,444 --> 00:40:04,121
watching you slowly
get weaker and weaker.

601
00:40:05,431 --> 00:40:08,237
I couldn't wait every day
to come home and...

602
00:40:08,912 --> 00:40:11,765
serve you a cup of tea,
bowl of soup.

603
00:40:12,764 --> 00:40:15,277
Pouring the mercury
in was the highlight, really,

604
00:40:15,397 --> 00:40:18,342
knowing it would eat you away
from the inside out.

605
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,183
I could not wait

606
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:25,542
to literally remove
your pathetic, whing presence

607
00:40:25,662 --> 00:40:29,513
from the people that I love the most
in this world... My mother, Sean.

608
00:40:33,023 --> 00:40:35,383
But I can't argue
with proof, now, can I?

609
00:40:37,155 --> 00:40:38,689
You've out smarted me, Julia.

610
00:40:41,808 --> 00:40:42,760
You win.

611
00:40:45,793 --> 00:40:47,847
I have to pay for what I've done.

612
00:40:49,702 --> 00:40:53,287
I'll go pack my bags, and we can wait
for my mother to get home,

613
00:40:54,469 --> 00:40:58,469
and I... I'll confess everything
to her and to the police.

614
00:41:00,996 --> 00:41:03,631
It's OK. I'm gonna confess. I'm...

615
00:41:07,515 --> 00:41:08,719
I'm sorry.

616
00:41:29,221 --> 00:41:31,242
You really should lock up your firearms

617
00:41:31,402 --> 00:41:34,578
and not leave 'em in a bedside
table drawer, you stupid bitch.

618
00:41:37,144 --> 00:41:40,084
You know, you were right
about one thing, Julia.

619
00:41:42,121 --> 00:41:43,932
I made a horrible mistake.

620
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:48,384
Mercury takes too damn long.

621
00:41:52,298 --> 00:41:54,791
