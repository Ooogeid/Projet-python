1
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:05,572
I am not ready to operate!

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,819
The cervical nerves are still inflamed,
and my hands aren't what they were.

3
00:00:08,944 --> 00:00:11,390
- Where's your partner?
- I prefer to work alone.

4
00:00:12,377 --> 00:00:13,304
Very nice.

5
00:00:14,482 --> 00:00:15,973
Are you a doctor?

6
00:00:16,645 --> 00:00:18,024
I'm your husband.

7
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,783
I can't walk. It's hard.

8
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:22,395
So is stage two breast cancer!

9
00:00:22,685 --> 00:00:24,735
What does breast cancer have
to do with anything?

10
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:25,816
I have it.

11
00:00:33,392 --> 00:00:36,076
Let me tell you
what I don't like about yourself.

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,414
I'm very sorry about that.

13
00:00:38,732 --> 00:00:41,832
Dr. Paresh is new here, I'm afraid,
and a little overzealous.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,935
Tell us what
you don't like about yourself.

15
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,432
It's mr. Shelly for starters.

16
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:52,310
You are a man.

17
00:00:53,138 --> 00:00:55,518
Sean could you send
Gunga Din out for some water, please?

18
00:00:55,643 --> 00:00:56,931
That's all right.

19
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:59,373
We're used to it, aren't we, Tracey?

20
00:00:59,597 --> 00:01:02,315
I can't tell you how many times
we've been mistaken for sisters

21
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,039
over the past few years,

22
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:05,380
even lesbians.

23
00:01:05,505 --> 00:01:07,807
What we are is horse people.

24
00:01:08,097 --> 00:01:10,431
We have a ranch up in Santa Clarita.

25
00:01:10,824 --> 00:01:13,989
The ranch hands have taken
to calling me "ma'am"

26
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,408
behind my back.

27
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,396
But you're generally in good health.

28
00:01:17,521 --> 00:01:19,373
Never been sick a day in my life,

29
00:01:19,498 --> 00:01:21,238
but i turned 45, and suddenly,

30
00:01:21,363 --> 00:01:23,374
all my muscles have turned to jelly,

31
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:25,746
my tummy is all flab,

32
00:01:25,871 --> 00:01:28,491
and i've got jowls
like my grandmother.

33
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,319
Have you experienced a
decrease in your sex drive?

34
00:01:32,444 --> 00:01:34,149
No question about that.

35
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:36,535
Just being honest, honey.

36
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,158
Hot flashes, irritability?

37
00:01:38,283 --> 00:01:41,142
Oh, my lord.
You're going through the change.

38
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:44,294
Actually, a gradual decrease
in testosterone can cause

39
00:01:44,419 --> 00:01:48,107
a hormonal condition similar
to those experienced by women.

40
00:01:48,426 --> 00:01:50,618
It is called andropause,
from the greek,

41
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:53,195
"andro" meaning male,
"pause" meaning stop.

42
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,522
There are various forms
of testosterone replacement.

43
00:01:55,647 --> 00:01:58,591
- Injections, creams.
- And risk cancer? Shit.

44
00:01:59,431 --> 00:02:01,328
I'd Rather turn into a girl.

45
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:04,457
Which, in fact, is a distinct
possibility hormonally speaking.

46
00:02:04,774 --> 00:02:07,980
Chemotherapy can produce temporary
or permanent sterility in men

47
00:02:08,105 --> 00:02:10,620
because of the effect upon the testes.
Ask dr. Christian troy.

48
00:02:10,745 --> 00:02:12,590
- Please.
- It's all right, Sean.

49
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,908
I was recently diagnosed
with breast cancer.

50
00:02:17,033 --> 00:02:19,398
I know all there is to know
about hormone therapies.

51
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,173
You poor man.

52
00:02:21,886 --> 00:02:23,120
I'm so sorry.

53
00:02:23,876 --> 00:02:27,612
Mr. Shelly, we can certainly give you
more definition in your jaw line,

54
00:02:27,737 --> 00:02:30,184
tighten up your cheeks,
give you some pec implants.

55
00:02:30,309 --> 00:02:32,574
No offense here, doctor, but...

56
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:37,114
Who the heck is gonna do the surgery?
I mean,

57
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:40,434
you're in a wheelchair,
and he's getting chemo,

58
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,922
and how old are you, son?

59
00:02:43,304 --> 00:02:45,247
17, but I am a genius.

60
00:02:46,152 --> 00:02:48,854
Mr. Shelly, regardless of what
dr. Mcnamara and I are going through,

61
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:50,920
I assure you
that we can make you look as virile

62
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:53,672
and masculine
as the man you are inside.

63
00:03:44,554 --> 00:03:46,505
Synchro: guig

64
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,657
Season 5 Episode 16
<i>Gene Shelly</i>

65
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,482
This might sting as it
enters the system.

66
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:03,382
- Where's the call button?
- I'm nearby. Don't worry.

67
00:04:03,507 --> 00:04:06,778
- When is the nausea most likely...
- Lizzie. Lizzie, lizzie,

68
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,415
I'm a big boy, OK?
I'll ask the questions.

69
00:04:36,185 --> 00:04:38,393
Stop it.
You've been a lesbian so long,

70
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:41,697
you forgot that men don't like
to be patted when you're puking.

71
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:43,248
Got you.

72
00:04:44,886 --> 00:04:45,886
Shit!

73
00:04:46,567 --> 00:04:47,893
I hate vomiting.

74
00:04:49,061 --> 00:04:51,284
It means that it's working, doll.

75
00:04:53,842 --> 00:04:55,127
That's an urban myth.

76
00:04:56,903 --> 00:04:58,187
What are you doing?

77
00:04:58,312 --> 00:05:01,646
I don't need a Mommy, I don't want
a mommy. Stop being my mommy!

78
00:05:06,002 --> 00:05:07,806
Will you get me some water, please?

79
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:14,860
Where's your toy?

80
00:05:15,456 --> 00:05:16,456
Here.

81
00:05:20,276 --> 00:05:21,519
There you go.

82
00:05:23,297 --> 00:05:26,074
Now you can focus
on what really counts, right,

83
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:28,372
picking up some babes in the park?

84
00:05:35,812 --> 00:05:37,353
Look. Mommy's here.

85
00:05:37,478 --> 00:05:40,130
Yes, she is.
Are you ready to go do some swinging?

86
00:05:43,325 --> 00:05:47,308
I made some pasta.
It's in the fridge and some juice boxes

87
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:49,890
there if you want to grab a couple.

88
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,915
- Do you need some...
- No. I got it.

89
00:05:54,237 --> 00:05:55,237
I'm OK.

90
00:05:57,576 --> 00:05:59,984
Looks like you've really
mastered that thing.

91
00:06:00,186 --> 00:06:02,625
It's not hard
once you get used to it.

92
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,600
- How's olivia?
- Great.

93
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,042
She's really taking care of me.

94
00:06:08,492 --> 00:06:09,801
And how are you?

95
00:06:11,494 --> 00:06:13,889
The doctor said
it will take as long as it takes,

96
00:06:14,014 --> 00:06:16,458
that I shouldn't expect
any miracles.

97
00:06:17,172 --> 00:06:18,809
Some things are coming back,

98
00:06:18,934 --> 00:06:22,023
Although I don't remember
the actual incident, but,

99
00:06:23,043 --> 00:06:24,043
you know,

100
00:06:24,286 --> 00:06:27,187
childhood memories
and my grandparents,

101
00:06:27,312 --> 00:06:28,396
relatives,

102
00:06:29,814 --> 00:06:31,348
our years together.

103
00:06:37,158 --> 00:06:39,153
I know you're still mad at me.

104
00:06:39,793 --> 00:06:40,986
Matt told me.

105
00:06:42,157 --> 00:06:45,382
I just don't understand
why you'd lie to me like that,

106
00:06:45,507 --> 00:06:47,735
you know,
tell me we were still married.

107
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,879
I guess at the time it just

108
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,101
seemed like it would help.

109
00:06:54,226 --> 00:06:55,226
Who?

110
00:06:55,725 --> 00:06:56,874
You or me?

111
00:07:14,362 --> 00:07:16,434
Olivia's working late all week.

112
00:07:17,014 --> 00:07:20,189
When was the last time you had
a good home-cooked meal?

113
00:07:30,652 --> 00:07:31,992
You know what's great?

114
00:07:32,447 --> 00:07:34,578
You haven't lost any hair
from the chemo yet.

115
00:07:35,006 --> 00:07:38,332
- You'd like to see me bald?
- What are you talking about?

116
00:07:38,457 --> 00:07:41,919
Did you know that 17% of cancer patients
don't actually loose their hair?

117
00:07:42,482 --> 00:07:43,830
That's gonna be me.

118
00:07:43,955 --> 00:07:46,041
I am stronger
than any of that chemical bullshit

119
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,466
they can dish at me.

120
00:07:47,591 --> 00:07:51,278
So, pal, even on chemo,
I'm gonna be better-looking than you.

121
00:07:51,593 --> 00:07:54,473
Don't be an asshole.
I was just making conversation.

122
00:07:57,883 --> 00:07:59,899
What i should have said was

123
00:08:00,765 --> 00:08:03,440
I feel terrible
you're going through this,

124
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,935
but I'm here for you,
whatever you need.

125
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,030
I'll let you know
when I need your help. I'm fine.

126
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:12,832
You don't look fine.
Why don't you take the day off?

127
00:08:12,957 --> 00:08:15,452
We have a patient. You're sure
as shit not gonna operate, are you?

128
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,270
- Raj is here. I'm assisting.
- You're ridiculous, all right?

129
00:08:19,395 --> 00:08:23,252
Plus, look. I need to work. You need
a hand wheeling yourself out of here?

130
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,670
No. I'm fine, pal.

131
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:02,304
Soon, it will be you in his place,
dr. Christian troy,

132
00:09:02,429 --> 00:09:03,687
and me in yours.

133
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,625
May I say that it will be
an honor to do your reconstruction.

134
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,923
Christian and I haven't actually
discussed you performing the surgery.

135
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:13,057
That's because there's nothing
to talk about. You're doing it.

136
00:09:13,182 --> 00:09:14,933
Jesus Christ!
We're talking about my tit.

137
00:09:15,058 --> 00:09:17,188
- I want the best.
- I can't operate in this chair.

138
00:09:17,313 --> 00:09:19,224
I will rig the table
so that you can reach it.

139
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,059
I mean, Jesus, Sean.

140
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,825
A little help here, Linda.
Who cranked up the heat in here?

141
00:09:24,324 --> 00:09:26,648
Are you trying to make it feel
like sweet home calcutta?

142
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,833
No one touches
the thermostat in here but me.

143
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,898
I'm sick and tired
of talking about you and that chair.

144
00:09:32,245 --> 00:09:34,607
Could you pass me a tray,
please, Linda?

145
00:09:41,744 --> 00:09:42,580


146
00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:44,458
Who wants to close?

147
00:09:50,495 --> 00:09:51,739
There you go.

148
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,691
- Are you expecting a play date, Gloria?
- No.

149
00:09:58,816 --> 00:10:01,505
Wilber and I go to the park,
mr. Christian.

150
00:10:11,704 --> 00:10:13,279
- Hi.
- Oh, hello.

151
00:10:14,245 --> 00:10:17,021
Where's matt?
Tuesday's his day to watch jenna.

152
00:10:17,146 --> 00:10:19,034
You're a little early
because it's monday.

153
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:20,953
- What? You're kidding.
- No.

154
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,019
No, no.

155
00:10:22,144 --> 00:10:23,822
I can't cancel my massage,
Christian.

156
00:10:23,947 --> 00:10:25,747
Do you have any idea
how tense i've been?

157
00:10:25,872 --> 00:10:28,575
Sure. Grandpa can take care of her.
No. She can't be around you.

158
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,753
- What if she catches something?
- What?

159
00:10:30,878 --> 00:10:34,097
Ah, gloria.
Gloria, right? Is that your name?

160
00:10:34,975 --> 00:10:37,886
Would you like to make
a little extra dinero right now?

161
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:38,759


162
00:10:38,884 --> 00:10:42,173
If you could watch my daughter
till I get back from my appointment,

163
00:10:42,298 --> 00:10:43,950
I will give you dos...

164
00:10:44,075 --> 00:10:46,575
Dos hundred dollars. Is that fair?

165
00:10:47,081 --> 00:10:49,976
- OK. Great. Here we go.
- Oh, little corazon.

166
00:10:52,396 --> 00:10:53,821
OK. Here we go.

167
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,493
Here's her bag.

168
00:10:56,098 --> 00:10:57,098


169
00:10:57,704 --> 00:11:00,254
- And the money?
- Money, yes. Very good.

170
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:02,286
There you go. OK. Yes.

171
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:04,435
- Good-Bye. Here we go.
- Come on, wilber.

172
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,500
- See you later, Wilber.
- See you. You be a good boy, all right?

173
00:11:09,358 --> 00:11:11,819
I'm sorry about the Jenna thing.
You understand. I just...

174
00:11:11,944 --> 00:11:14,744
I want what's best for her.
Do you have any water?

175
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:18,932
I need to start flushing my toxins
right now. I'm exhausted.

176
00:11:20,034 --> 00:11:23,098
I understand. In fact,
I've never seen you this tense.

177
00:11:24,093 --> 00:11:25,791
You have no idea.

178
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:28,856
I mean, maybe a little bit
with the cancer, but being a mother...

179
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:30,726
there's nothing more stressful.

180
00:11:30,851 --> 00:11:31,851
I bet.

181
00:11:34,477 --> 00:11:38,284
And with Eden living with you
and ram,

182
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,479
I'm sure you're not

183
00:11:42,453 --> 00:11:44,575
getting the attention you need.

184
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:49,275
- You always know what to do.
- That's because i'm a real man.

185
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:54,369
I want to hear you say it.

186
00:11:54,494 --> 00:11:55,846
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

187
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:03,088
You're a real man, baby.

188
00:12:14,729 --> 00:12:15,770
Leave it on.

189
00:12:15,895 --> 00:12:17,816
Real men have scars.

190
00:12:41,911 --> 00:12:42,988
I'm sorry.

191
00:12:44,238 --> 00:12:45,614
That's disgusting.

192
00:12:46,331 --> 00:12:48,621
- What?
- It's... It's disgusting,

193
00:12:49,332 --> 00:12:51,269
and I'm not surprised because

194
00:12:51,929 --> 00:12:53,816
you, with all of your self-loathing

195
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:56,760
and the way you've treated people,
no wonder you pulled that in.

196
00:12:56,885 --> 00:12:58,393
- I did what?
- You did this.

197
00:12:58,518 --> 00:13:00,195
It's karma, Christian. It's a bitch.

198
00:13:00,392 --> 00:13:03,034
Are you gloating at the fact
that I have cancer?

199
00:13:03,646 --> 00:13:04,741
Get out of here.

200
00:13:08,851 --> 00:13:11,652
I bet that made you feel like
a real man now,

201
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,000
throwing me around like that?

202
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,686
I feel sorry for you, Christian.

203
00:13:17,811 --> 00:13:20,743
I do, but when you look
at all the emotional scars

204
00:13:20,868 --> 00:13:22,968
you've left on other women
over the years...

205
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,116
I'm surprised
that this didn't happen to you sooner.

206
00:13:48,174 --> 00:13:50,603
You're a great candidate
for liposuction, miss taylor.

207
00:13:50,728 --> 00:13:52,996
The incisions will be very small,
I promise.

208
00:13:53,121 --> 00:13:55,257
Your co-workers won't notice a thing

209
00:13:55,382 --> 00:13:57,294
except how much better
you look of course.

210
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,463
So it says here

211
00:14:00,588 --> 00:14:02,798
that you take naproxen

212
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:05,051
and celebrex for arthritis,

213
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,905
tagamet for gerd...

214
00:14:08,032 --> 00:14:11,661
and liotrix for hypothyroidism?

215
00:14:13,032 --> 00:14:14,308
Wow. OK.

216
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,158
And tou take tagamet every day?

217
00:14:17,283 --> 00:14:18,283
Yes.

218
00:14:19,249 --> 00:14:20,826
- That's right.
- OK.

219
00:14:22,921 --> 00:14:25,448
I'm gonna have to look this up
just because I'm not sure

220
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:28,241
that you should be taking
all these if...

221
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:32,657
OK. Let's just...
Let's move on for a second.

222
00:14:32,782 --> 00:14:35,874
Your face-lift. So I can easily

223
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:37,474
remove your brown lines

224
00:14:37,599 --> 00:14:39,544
with injections of botox...

225
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,379
here and here

226
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,877
and pull back...

227
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,842
- here and here.
- That hurts!

228
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,687
- Stop.
- I'm sorr... I'm sorry.

229
00:14:47,812 --> 00:14:50,174
Are you trying
to break my skin with that thing?

230
00:14:50,299 --> 00:14:52,270
This isn't worth $15 an hour.

231
00:14:52,395 --> 00:14:54,605
She's a real live person,
Dr. Pendell,

232
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:57,461
not just some body on a table.
You know, you have to talk to her,

233
00:14:57,725 --> 00:15:00,510
you have to listen to her.
What's your name, ma'am?

234
00:15:01,478 --> 00:15:03,334
- Lila Rusovic.
- Ms. Rusovic,

235
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:05,278
thank you so much for coming today.

236
00:15:05,651 --> 00:15:09,199
It's not much money for your time,
but it really helps the students

237
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,200
to practice their consultations.

238
00:15:11,325 --> 00:15:13,682
That's OK.
I enjoy the role-playing.

239
00:15:14,228 --> 00:15:17,489
It's more fun than sitting around
watching the soaps all day.

240
00:15:17,614 --> 00:15:18,641
Well, good.

241
00:15:18,766 --> 00:15:22,477
Let's talk about your prescriptions
before we talk about the operation.

242
00:15:22,602 --> 00:15:24,651
How long have you had
this thyroid problem?

243
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,018
- 4 years.
- OK.

244
00:15:26,143 --> 00:15:28,045
<i> Have you been
on the liotrix the whole time?</i>

245
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,929
I was in awe at the way
you connected with that woman.

246
00:15:32,093 --> 00:15:34,048
You're connecting now, Daphne!

247
00:15:37,421 --> 00:15:39,563
- I can take good care of people.
- You can.

248
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,552
- I know I can.
- You can.

249
00:15:42,851 --> 00:15:44,568
God, you are beautiful.

250
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,517
You're a big boy.

251
00:15:49,369 --> 00:15:50,369
My baby.

252
00:15:50,927 --> 00:15:53,687
My big, beautiful baby boy.

253
00:15:55,013 --> 00:15:56,355
Oh, my god.

254
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,789
Please, mommy.

255
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:17,097
What the hell's going on here?

256
00:16:17,941 --> 00:16:18,937
Jesus, Raj.

257
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:21,726
You're a physician.
This is a place of business.

258
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:23,648
Back off, doc holiday.

259
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,735
I was just thanking Raji
for the bang-up job he did on Gene.

260
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:29,112
Next time, buy him a muffin basket.
Do you have any idea

261
00:16:29,277 --> 00:16:31,697
what kind of a lawsuit we'd be facing
if Gene found out about this?

262
00:16:31,817 --> 00:16:33,658
You're all down but 9, doctor.

263
00:16:33,979 --> 00:16:37,162
- What the hell does that mean?
- It means... you're missing the point.

264
00:16:38,115 --> 00:16:41,333
Not a whole lot to do up
in horse country except ride

265
00:16:41,927 --> 00:16:42,927
and screw.

266
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:46,177
Trace and I,
we like to stay open-minded.

267
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,340
Well, next time, open your minds
and your mouths somewhere else.

268
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:55,013
You are tight as a spring.

269
00:16:55,602 --> 00:16:59,186
If you don't release some of that energy
you got gurgling up in your pants,

270
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:01,905
you're gonna give yourself
a heart attack.

271
00:17:06,602 --> 00:17:10,528
Please forgive me, dr. Christian Troy.
I have never experienced a woman before.

272
00:17:11,018 --> 00:17:12,510
It was so glorious.

273
00:17:14,914 --> 00:17:15,909
Go home, Raj.

274
00:17:27,287 --> 00:17:29,906
Look at you.
You're practically walking again.

275
00:17:32,014 --> 00:17:33,820
- Can you grab my chair?
- Yeah.

276
00:17:33,945 --> 00:17:35,509
Leave it where it is.

277
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:38,765
I want to see you
walk to it yourself.

278
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,767
5 steps without the bars?

279
00:17:40,892 --> 00:17:42,978
- You can do it.
- No, i can't.

280
00:17:43,323 --> 00:17:45,196
Just bring it over, please.

281
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,287
You want the chair again,

282
00:17:47,635 --> 00:17:50,193
You're going to have
to get it on your own.

283
00:17:50,711 --> 00:17:51,711
I can't.

284
00:17:54,655 --> 00:17:57,939
Come on. He already wore himself out.
Just bring him the chair.

285
00:17:58,403 --> 00:17:59,828
Your muscle mass is normal,

286
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,688
Your range of motion is
above average.

287
00:18:03,024 --> 00:18:05,458
I've worked
in rehabilitation for 9 years.

288
00:18:05,703 --> 00:18:07,700
I know when someone is ready
to walk,

289
00:18:07,825 --> 00:18:10,456
and i know when someone
is refusing to.

290
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,121
Matt, the chair.

291
00:18:15,737 --> 00:18:17,429
- You can walk!
- I need the chair!

292
00:18:17,643 --> 00:18:18,806
You can walk!

293
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,236
Walk, sean!

294
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:21,641
Walk!

295
00:18:37,473 --> 00:18:39,114
Dad! You OK?

296
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:43,297
- You're fired. Get out of here.
- You're babying him.

297
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:44,987
I said get the hell out of here.

298
00:18:45,112 --> 00:18:47,917
You have no idea what you're doing
or how to treat people, so just go!

299
00:18:53,751 --> 00:18:54,751
Here.

300
00:18:58,127 --> 00:18:59,137
It's OK, man.

301
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:02,348
You'll walk when you're ready.
You're doing the best you can. I know.

302
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:06,167
Thank you.

303
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:16,961
I love washing your body.

304
00:19:28,923 --> 00:19:31,125
I want to take away all your pain,

305
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,444
all your trauma, all your fear.

306
00:19:35,056 --> 00:19:36,614
Why don't you join me?

307
00:19:37,993 --> 00:19:38,993
Come on.

308
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:43,388
The big, bad monster lady took away

309
00:19:43,513 --> 00:19:45,225
all your trust,

310
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,392
didn't she?

311
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,483
Actually,
i'm doing pretty fine at the moment.

312
00:19:52,212 --> 00:19:54,175
- I have an idea.
- What?

313
00:19:54,706 --> 00:19:56,831
I know just what you need, baby.

314
00:19:57,657 --> 00:19:58,701
Come here.

315
00:19:59,348 --> 00:20:02,073
- Put your arms around me.
- Daphne, take your clothes off.

316
00:20:02,198 --> 00:20:04,696
Trust me, baby. Trust me.

317
00:20:04,821 --> 00:20:06,903
Come on. Put your arms around mommy.

318
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,853
- OK.
- Come on, baby. Hold on.

319
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:11,472
Hold on to mommy.

320
00:20:12,185 --> 00:20:13,461
There you go.

321
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:16,826
There you go.

322
00:20:19,448 --> 00:20:22,066
Baby's all clean now.

323
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:25,370
Come here.

324
00:20:30,911 --> 00:20:32,564
Just one more thing.

325
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:36,976
Just think how soft and smooth

326
00:20:37,101 --> 00:20:38,403
you'll be for mommy?

327
00:20:41,789 --> 00:20:43,199
Sweetie, what are you doing?

328
00:20:43,667 --> 00:20:44,909
Don't you trust me?

329
00:20:45,812 --> 00:20:47,339
Show me how brave you are.

330
00:20:47,464 --> 00:20:50,346
You need
to learn how to trust again, baby.

331
00:20:54,103 --> 00:20:56,091
You like the foamy friction?

332
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:58,042
Oh, yes, you do.

333
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,446
No, no. Stay still. Stay very still.

334
00:21:01,571 --> 00:21:02,926
No sudden moves

335
00:21:03,643 --> 00:21:05,533
so mommy's hand won't slip.

336
00:21:06,991 --> 00:21:08,984
You are gonna be as soft

337
00:21:09,109 --> 00:21:12,034
and smooth as a baby's bottom.

338
00:21:16,103 --> 00:21:17,216
That's it.

339
00:21:22,008 --> 00:21:23,014
Hey, baby.

340
00:21:23,139 --> 00:21:24,697
Who the hell are you?

341
00:21:26,002 --> 00:21:27,797
I'm kitty. We talked on the phone.

342
00:21:27,922 --> 00:21:30,084
We may have talked on the
phone, but you're not kitty,

343
00:21:30,209 --> 00:21:32,141
not the kitty i saw on craigslist.

344
00:21:32,266 --> 00:21:34,903
Yeah.
That picture's a few years old.

345
00:21:36,174 --> 00:21:37,666
And of someone else.

346
00:21:40,902 --> 00:21:42,050
Look, dude.

347
00:21:43,372 --> 00:21:44,372
I'm here,

348
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:46,296
I have a vagina.

349
00:21:46,802 --> 00:21:49,170
It's a pretty good one,
believe it or not,

350
00:21:49,295 --> 00:21:51,927
and for 300 bucks,
you can put your dick in it

351
00:21:52,052 --> 00:21:54,348
or any of my other welcoming holes,

352
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:56,885
and afterwards,
I will leave without asking

353
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,786
for so much as a hot pocket.

354
00:22:00,144 --> 00:22:01,161
So...

355
00:22:01,476 --> 00:22:03,042
am I staying or going?

356
00:22:03,602 --> 00:22:04,602
Fine.

357
00:22:04,987 --> 00:22:06,303
OK. Cool-Moe-Dee.

358
00:22:06,428 --> 00:22:07,590
So do you want

359
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,536
straight sex or something kinky?

360
00:22:11,195 --> 00:22:12,886
Just something straight.

361
00:22:19,515 --> 00:22:20,515
Don't.

362
00:22:23,229 --> 00:22:24,590
You want a drink?

363
00:22:26,013 --> 00:22:27,013
Sure.

364
00:22:29,852 --> 00:22:30,852
Nice digs.

365
00:22:31,186 --> 00:22:33,481
I was once with one
of the dudes from "taxi"

366
00:22:33,606 --> 00:22:35,353
at a place very near here

367
00:22:37,061 --> 00:22:38,412
a few years ago.

368
00:22:41,635 --> 00:22:43,486
You don't have aids or anything,
do you?

369
00:22:46,692 --> 00:22:48,408
Because you...
You look like shit.

370
00:22:49,764 --> 00:22:51,306
No. I have cancer.

371
00:22:53,966 --> 00:22:56,545
Well,
no refunds if you can't get it up.

372
00:22:57,784 --> 00:22:58,944
I'll be fine.

373
00:22:59,474 --> 00:23:01,663
As long as you're not contagious.

374
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:12,850
Jesus christ! What, you swallow
a whole loaf of garlic bread?

375
00:23:15,028 --> 00:23:17,675
I went to the olive garden.
I've got to eat, don't I?

376
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,605
Oh God! Get out.

377
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:23,740
Relax. I have an altoid. I don't know
where you get off being so choosy.

378
00:23:23,865 --> 00:23:25,962
Have you taken
a good look at yourself?

379
00:23:26,087 --> 00:23:27,661
You're no rico suave.

380
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,749
No refunds. I want my money.

381
00:23:37,918 --> 00:23:41,419
- For stinking up my living room?
- I walk through the door, I get paid.

382
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:47,633
What are you doing? Give me that.

383
00:23:48,121 --> 00:23:50,159
Give it to me. Give it to me!

384
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:56,059
Don't take those. Please.

385
00:23:56,489 --> 00:23:58,895
- I need them. I'm sick.
- Call your doctor.

386
00:24:00,427 --> 00:24:01,427
Dickhead.

387
00:24:25,124 --> 00:24:26,317
Hey. It's me.

388
00:24:27,361 --> 00:24:28,753
Can you come over?

389
00:24:38,651 --> 00:24:39,929
Where's wilber?

390
00:24:42,961 --> 00:24:44,601
At the nanny's house.

391
00:24:46,309 --> 00:24:48,066
He's close with her son.

392
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:52,974
- And how did you say the lamp broke?
- I told you. I tripped.

393
00:24:55,773 --> 00:24:57,411
Why's it smell like shalimar?

394
00:24:59,934 --> 00:25:00,934
Shit.

395
00:25:09,426 --> 00:25:10,426
Ohh! Liz!

396
00:25:11,095 --> 00:25:12,471
I'm not watching.

397
00:25:17,625 --> 00:25:20,023
Aren't you gonna do
the rub my back thing?

398
00:25:30,899 --> 00:25:32,399
Here. Take this.

399
00:25:32,524 --> 00:25:36,272
You'll be out before you know it,
and tonight will seem like a bad dream.

400
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,429
You're the real deal, Lizzie.
Who knew?

401
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:48,066
I left you juice,

402
00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:50,901
I cleaned the lamp,
I scrubbed the toilet.

403
00:25:51,286 --> 00:25:52,843
You're gonna be good.

404
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,719
I will see you in the morning.

405
00:25:58,165 --> 00:25:58,973
Liz.

406
00:25:59,788 --> 00:26:00,788
Yeah?

407
00:26:02,849 --> 00:26:04,308
Can you stay awhile,

408
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,982
just until I fall asleep?

409
00:29:38,084 --> 00:29:39,401
Dr. Christian troy.

410
00:29:39,526 --> 00:29:41,998
- I apologize if I am late.
- No. You're right on time.

411
00:29:42,123 --> 00:29:45,343
I was just thinking, while we're at it,
why don't we got a little bit bigger,

412
00:29:45,468 --> 00:29:47,993
bulk it up a little,
you know, bilateral implants?

413
00:29:49,347 --> 00:29:51,493
Let me show you what I was thinking.

414
00:29:57,158 --> 00:29:59,729
Dr. Liz Cruz,
we are meeting in here.

415
00:30:02,791 --> 00:30:04,784
- Hi, Christian.
- What do you think, Lizzie,

416
00:30:04,909 --> 00:30:06,665
- one pec or two?
- One.

417
00:30:07,253 --> 00:30:09,640
I don't think
your chest needs any more inflating.

418
00:30:10,583 --> 00:30:12,620
Here we are then. 3-D imagine,

419
00:30:12,745 --> 00:30:14,687
the latest in cat scan technology.

420
00:30:17,074 --> 00:30:19,859
- How you feeling?
- Good. Thanks for coming over.

421
00:30:20,908 --> 00:30:22,656
I will now present a 3-D rendering

422
00:30:22,936 --> 00:30:26,323
of dr. Christian Troy's custom-made
pectoralis implant.

423
00:30:28,286 --> 00:30:29,660
What is going on here?

424
00:30:30,414 --> 00:30:32,938
Raj is showing us
a demonstration of my breast implants.

425
00:30:33,063 --> 00:30:34,278
Without consulting me?

426
00:30:34,403 --> 00:30:36,567
You said you didn't want to do it.
Do you want me to beg?

427
00:30:36,692 --> 00:30:38,627
- Fine. It's your body.
- Sean,

428
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,632
Christian had
a really rough night last night,

429
00:30:40,916 --> 00:30:43,153
so maybe this isn't the time
to have that discussion.

430
00:30:43,278 --> 00:30:46,130
Lizzie, it's really not your concern,
and by the way,

431
00:30:46,255 --> 00:30:48,233
why did you leave this morning
without saying good-bye?

432
00:30:48,353 --> 00:30:49,558
Without making you breakfast?

433
00:30:49,809 --> 00:30:51,834
Left?
What were you doing at our place?

434
00:30:51,959 --> 00:30:54,276
She was holding my head up
while I was puking in the bowl.

435
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:56,648
Are you gonna get pissed because
I didn't call you at your girlfriend's

436
00:30:56,814 --> 00:30:57,852
so you could come over
and do that, too?

437
00:30:57,972 --> 00:30:59,221
It was really no big deal.

438
00:30:59,346 --> 00:31:00,963
I just came over,
I kept him company,

439
00:31:01,088 --> 00:31:04,175
I rubbed his back, and then we just
drifted off into sleep, and,

440
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:06,697
- you know, it was...
- Liz cruz,

441
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,410
you and dr. Christian Troy
had sexual intercourse.

442
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:12,234
- You and liz had sex?
- Yeah. Lizzie was there for me.

443
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:14,338
She spread her legs
and made me feel good.

444
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,831
You were awake?

445
00:31:17,138 --> 00:31:18,596
I got my mojo back.

446
00:31:19,626 --> 00:31:20,994
It just happened.

447
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,159
I was practically asleep,
and I thought that he was asleep.

448
00:31:24,504 --> 00:31:27,426
Practically? Nobody orgasms like
that if they're practically asleep.

449
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:31,222
You pretended to be out of it,
and why didn't you say anything?

450
00:31:31,534 --> 00:31:33,557
It was late,
and I know what lesbians are like.

451
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,852
- They like to cuddle and talk.
- You arrogant, little prick.

452
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,443
- Come on. It's not a big deal.
- Oh, no! You're right.

453
00:31:39,568 --> 00:31:42,612
You know what? It is no big deal because
I knew that you weren't sleeping,

454
00:31:42,737 --> 00:31:46,713
and I faked my orgasm,
and you are a lousy lay!

455
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,154
That is a snap.

456
00:31:55,723 --> 00:31:57,185
She didn't fake it.

457
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:59,431
Nobody fakes it that good.

458
00:32:00,017 --> 00:32:01,017
Nobody.

459
00:32:12,293 --> 00:32:15,088
God. I love
how smooth you are down there.

460
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:21,326
I have some surprises
for my baby tonight.

461
00:32:22,957 --> 00:32:24,066
I like that.

462
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,287
Oh, that's warm.

463
00:32:30,487 --> 00:32:32,886
I don't want your skin
to be all dry down there.

464
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:34,580
One more.

465
00:32:38,185 --> 00:32:39,964
I get to do you next, OK?

466
00:32:41,635 --> 00:32:42,918
Close your eyes.

467
00:32:43,598 --> 00:32:45,796
- Don't look.
- OK.

468
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:48,451
You ready?

469
00:32:49,165 --> 00:32:50,805
You ready for Mommy?

470
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:58,153
Don't look.

471
00:32:58,528 --> 00:32:59,602
Almost there.

472
00:33:00,209 --> 00:33:01,224
That's...

473
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:05,482
- Good boy.
- What the...

474
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,650
Good boy.

475
00:33:09,066 --> 00:33:11,155
Oh, my god! Your legs!

476
00:33:11,463 --> 00:33:13,073
- A diaper?
- You can walk?!

477
00:33:13,995 --> 00:33:16,452
It's a goddamn miracle.
Now, you, out!

478
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:19,161
But... You know what? You love it.

479
00:33:19,286 --> 00:33:21,751
You love the attention.
You love being treated like a child.

480
00:33:21,876 --> 00:33:24,661
- I'm not your big baby huey.
- You're a big baby liar

481
00:33:24,786 --> 00:33:28,064
- Pretending that you need a wheelchair.
- Not anymore!

482
00:33:52,065 --> 00:33:54,389
Hiya, mr. Raj. How you doing?

483
00:33:57,518 --> 00:33:58,518
Oh, my...

484
00:33:59,712 --> 00:34:00,829
You have a penis.

485
00:34:04,985 --> 00:34:06,669
It goes with my balls...

486
00:34:11,224 --> 00:34:13,913
but it doesn't make me
any less of a woman.

487
00:34:41,195 --> 00:34:43,497
Raj, am I interrupting?

488
00:34:43,885 --> 00:34:45,404
Are you meditating?

489
00:34:46,588 --> 00:34:49,253
I am praying to free myself
from impurity and sin.

490
00:34:49,698 --> 00:34:51,085
Well, aim high.

491
00:35:02,754 --> 00:35:04,309
- Liz Cruz?
- Yeah?

492
00:35:04,478 --> 00:35:07,571
Why do you choose
to rub vaginas with your own sex?

493
00:35:09,722 --> 00:35:12,133
Attraction isn't something
you choose.

494
00:35:13,213 --> 00:35:14,213
It's...

495
00:35:14,485 --> 00:35:15,863
just who you are.

496
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:17,865
But what if I don't want
to be what I am?

497
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:19,491
What are you talking about?

498
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:30,339
I was very attracted
to Tracey Shelly.

499
00:35:30,464 --> 00:35:31,830
We had oral copulation.

500
00:35:31,955 --> 00:35:34,277
It was more ecstatic
than releasing my kundalini.

501
00:35:34,402 --> 00:35:36,525
You know what?
I don't think I want to know any more.

502
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:37,932
But just now...

503
00:35:39,842 --> 00:35:41,224
in the men's room,

504
00:35:41,603 --> 00:35:44,873
- I discovered tracey had a penis.
- Oh, wait a minute.

505
00:35:44,998 --> 00:35:46,383
Tracey is a man?

506
00:35:47,596 --> 00:35:48,596
Yes.

507
00:35:52,036 --> 00:35:54,313
The best sex I have ever had...

508
00:35:55,036 --> 00:35:56,363
was from a dude.

509
00:35:59,971 --> 00:36:00,971
Look.

510
00:36:01,186 --> 00:36:03,875
It is OK to be confused.

511
00:36:04,713 --> 00:36:06,497
Sex is like politics.

512
00:36:06,837 --> 00:36:09,192
You label yourself...
Republican, Democrat

513
00:36:09,317 --> 00:36:11,083
straight or gay...

514
00:36:11,604 --> 00:36:14,228
And then one day,
you cross party lines

515
00:36:14,353 --> 00:36:17,818
because you have a strong feeling
about a particular candidate,

516
00:36:19,224 --> 00:36:21,639
and then you don't know
what you are.

517
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:23,786
I like breasts, Liz Cruz.

518
00:36:24,186 --> 00:36:25,406
Well, so do I.

519
00:36:27,077 --> 00:36:28,077
Or I did.

520
00:36:29,661 --> 00:36:32,582
- You don't like them anymore?
- Of course I do.

521
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:38,959
Labels are for cans of tuna,
not people.

522
00:36:47,794 --> 00:36:49,167
Thank you, Liz Cruz.

523
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,750
I think you are a beautiful lesbian

524
00:36:52,398 --> 00:36:55,011
or nonlesbian, whatever you decide.

525
00:37:08,673 --> 00:37:09,673
I'm sorry.

526
00:37:10,409 --> 00:37:11,366
It's broken?

527
00:37:11,491 --> 00:37:13,885
No. I'm sorry because you're
such an idiot for punching a wall.

528
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:16,755
He's lucky he wasn't at home
when mom told me, or else it would be

529
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,742
- his busted head you'd be examining.
- Just take a breath, all right?

530
00:37:19,867 --> 00:37:22,027
I'm surprised you're not angrier,
Christian

531
00:37:22,152 --> 00:37:24,005
I'm still not convinced
you saw what you saw.

532
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:27,408
Sean was standing there
naked at the front door,

533
00:37:27,533 --> 00:37:28,954
tossing some floozy out,

534
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:32,249
and then he smoothly walked
back to his room.

535
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:34,871
I mean,
the whole thing was so inconceivable

536
00:37:34,996 --> 00:37:37,045
that first I thought it was you.

537
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,132
And then you noticed
the missing 3 inches?

538
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,066
Be serious, Christian.

539
00:37:41,829 --> 00:37:44,074
Now Sean's made fools of all of us.

540
00:37:44,326 --> 00:37:47,535
The only reason I was there was
because I actually felt sorry

541
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:50,281
for him because
I saw your empty refrigerator.

542
00:37:50,406 --> 00:37:52,429
I was actually gonna cook dinner
for him.

543
00:37:52,554 --> 00:37:55,480
I just don't understand why he'd do it.
It's just so much more work trying

544
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,506
to pull this off then it would be
if he just stood up.

545
00:37:57,626 --> 00:37:59,315
He's a big baby.
He wanted attention.

546
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,987
I was around all the time.
He got mom to forgive him out of pity.

547
00:38:02,156 --> 00:38:04,959
Sean has used us,
he has manipulated us

548
00:38:05,084 --> 00:38:07,576
to fulfill some kind
of regression fantasy.

549
00:38:07,701 --> 00:38:10,871
You're actually sick,
and he stuck you with all the work.

550
00:38:11,075 --> 00:38:12,488
He's so addicted to coddling,

551
00:38:12,613 --> 00:38:15,500
he's letting that indian kid
do your reconstruction surgery.

552
00:38:16,868 --> 00:38:18,670
He's supposed
to be your best friend.

553
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:23,899
Look. I say we all wait for him here,
push him down to the pier,

554
00:38:24,024 --> 00:38:25,645
and dump him and that chair
into the ocean

555
00:38:25,765 --> 00:38:27,457
and see how fast
his legs start working then.

556
00:38:27,577 --> 00:38:28,931
I'll deal with this...

557
00:38:29,798 --> 00:38:30,798
alone.

558
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:32,470
And, Julia,

559
00:38:33,048 --> 00:38:34,645
start using the front door.

560
00:38:56,202 --> 00:38:57,334
Oh, you caught me.

561
00:38:58,055 --> 00:39:00,136
I was just finishing
my shoulder presses

562
00:39:00,732 --> 00:39:03,556
Helps me get up those ramps, you know?
I had one more set.

563
00:39:03,681 --> 00:39:04,681
Right.

564
00:39:06,866 --> 00:39:09,012
What are you doing home so early?

565
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,029
What's going on?

566
00:39:11,154 --> 00:39:12,464
We need to talk

567
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,398
about what is going on with you
and this chair.

568
00:39:22,989 --> 00:39:25,821
You're right,
and I know what this is about.

569
00:39:27,763 --> 00:39:30,923
You're still pissed
that I'm not doing your surgery,

570
00:39:32,646 --> 00:39:33,792
and i get it.

571
00:39:33,917 --> 00:39:36,363
No one feels worse about it
than I do,

572
00:39:36,488 --> 00:39:39,048
but if you think you can force me
to get better so I just jump up

573
00:39:39,173 --> 00:39:41,152
and walk back into surgery,
you're wrong.

574
00:39:41,776 --> 00:39:43,842
I don't need
any more pressure right now.

575
00:39:43,967 --> 00:39:46,460
I'm doing the best I can, all right?

576
00:39:54,991 --> 00:39:56,286
I know you are.

577
00:39:57,524 --> 00:39:58,603
You always have.

578
00:40:01,014 --> 00:40:03,444
You've always been
the responsible one.

579
00:40:04,548 --> 00:40:07,491
You're the one who studied in college
while I was out partying.

580
00:40:07,616 --> 00:40:10,741
You're the one who had kids and
got married when I was screwing around.

581
00:40:12,045 --> 00:40:15,579
Must be exhausting having
to take care of everybody else.

582
00:40:20,526 --> 00:40:22,015
All I want to say is

583
00:40:24,931 --> 00:40:27,132
you stay in that chair
as long as you need.

584
00:40:29,069 --> 00:40:30,927
As far as the surgery's concerned,

585
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,407
that can wait as long as it takes.

586
00:40:39,678 --> 00:40:40,678
All right?

587
00:40:49,524 --> 00:40:50,524
Shit.

588
00:40:51,332 --> 00:40:52,332
Chemo.

589
00:41:14,082 --> 00:41:15,130
Don't fight it.

590
00:41:18,027 --> 00:41:19,911
It's less painful that way.
