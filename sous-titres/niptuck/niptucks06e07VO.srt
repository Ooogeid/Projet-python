1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,205
Previously on Nip/Tuck...

2
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:03,558
There must be an awful
lot you don't like...

3
00:00:03,563 --> 00:00:05,805
about yourself for you
to attempt suicide.

4
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:08,540
I was gonna swim until
my arms fell off.

5
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,785
A father is willing to leave
his children fatherless?

6
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,985
I'm petitioning for
custody of the children.

7
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,875
Mother. You're in your 60s.

8
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,875
Who is this man?

9
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,665
Renaldo is my husband.

10
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,245
He always wanted children.

11
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,430
All I want is to be a good
father to Annie and Conor.

12
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,400
Let's get this clear.
I--I'm not into men.

13
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,060
I'm not a woman.
I'm a gay man.

14
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,990
If I become Alex,
you become a fag?

15
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:39,619
In my mind, if you were Alex,
you'd have a bloody nose right now.

16
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:42,930
Turn around. Walk with
your back towards us.

17
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,251
You see? You know the
way things are in here.

18
00:00:45,371 --> 00:00:47,673
You have neither the
muscle mass nor...

19
00:00:47,678 --> 00:00:50,100
the gang affiliations
to be a predator.

20
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,495
You want me to become
somebody's bitch?

21
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,030
It's a small price to
pay for your life.

22
00:01:20,603 --> 00:01:22,992
I'm, uh, Christian Troy,
here to see my son, uh,

23
00:01:23,112 --> 00:01:24,935
- Matt McNamara.
- Sign in.

24
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,860
Down the hall, to the
left. He's in number 6.

25
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,715
I'm Kessler.

26
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,080
Your son's doing just fine.
He sends his love.

27
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,955
Where is Matt?
I want to see Matt.

28
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,420
Don't worry, I'm taking
good care of him.

29
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,830
Things were a little
rough at first,

30
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,555
but he's doing much better
since the transfer.

31
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,100
- What transfer?
- To my cell.

32
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,890
He'll only get him into
trouble if you do that.

33
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,520
If I find out that
you hurt him--

34
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,210
Relax. He's much safer
now than he was before.

35
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,765
As long as he takes
care of me...

36
00:03:17,885 --> 00:03:20,914
and you decide to help,
he'll be fine.

37
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,937
You're a plastic
surgeon, right?

38
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,212
Yes.

39
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:29,130
Great. I may sound
a bit old-fashioned,

40
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,402
but I think
it's the woman's job...

41
00:03:31,522 --> 00:03:33,218
to maintain her appearance.

42
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,430
Matt's a good-looking kid,

43
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,108
nice features,

44
00:03:38,045 --> 00:03:40,332
but the one thing he needs...

45
00:03:40,863 --> 00:03:42,686
what you can give him...

46
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,026
is a nice set of tits.

47
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:54,145
If you're worried the board
won't approve the surgery.

48
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,328
I've already got Matt speaking
to the shrink in here,

49
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,820
claiming he wants
to be a woman.

50
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:04,341
Papers got filed...
There's a precedent for this.

51
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,950
You know what?
I don't believe that Matt...

52
00:04:08,232 --> 00:04:09,919
would agree to any of this.

53
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:11,392
Oh, you wouldn't believe...

54
00:04:11,397 --> 00:04:14,037
what he's agreed to
since he's been in here.

55
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,240
Now look, I'm doing life.

56
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,004
I haven't even touched
a woman in 16 years.

57
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:22,180
Do you know what
that does to a man?

58
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,392
How you learn to adapt?

59
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,926
I can't go back
to being the man

60
00:04:33,931 --> 00:04:35,931
I was any more
than Matt can.

61
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,231
Oh, I mean...

62
00:04:38,985 --> 00:04:40,710
if I could help you and,

63
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,671
in some other kind of way,

64
00:04:43,676 --> 00:04:46,590
I can give you money
for an appeal, or,

65
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:51,320
uh, I don't know... organize
a hooker or something?

66
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,754
You got 48 hours.

67
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,679
Your son's a good kid,

68
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,205
but he ain't gonna
be worth much to...

69
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:02,000
either one of us unless
you do what I say.

70
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,692
Trust me on that.

Season 6 - Episode 7
"Alexis Stone II"

73
00:05:43,002 --> 00:05:46,980
Original VO: Ladyhawk

74
00:05:51,008 --> 00:05:54,008
Corrections & Resynchro VO : Sean

75
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:23,900
When did Annie begin
showing signs of depression?

76
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:29,760
I guess it was after we
returned to New York, yeah.

77
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:34,110
It was a stressful
time for all of us.

78
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,405
Why?

79
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:38,210
Because of, uh, Olivia's
death, you know?

80
00:06:38,801 --> 00:06:42,100
She was an important
part of our family.

81
00:06:42,973 --> 00:06:44,470
That makes sense.

82
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,634
Death, divorce,

83
00:06:46,754 --> 00:06:49,851
moving... 3 of the most
stressful events in life, and...

84
00:06:50,165 --> 00:06:52,517
Conor and Annie
experienced all 3...

85
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:55,520
in a very short
time, didn't they?

86
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,448
Yes.

87
00:06:56,568 --> 00:07:00,270
Isn't that exactly what
happened, Ms. McNamara?

88
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,850
You and their father divorced.

89
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:10,911
You moved them from
their home to New York,

90
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:12,790
and then to Los Angeles.

91
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,230
You subjected your
children to a seemingly...

92
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:19,880
unending barrage of
unsettling, horrific events.

93
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,225
I'm surprised your daughter
didn't try to kill herself...

94
00:07:22,345 --> 00:07:25,201
after she reached out in
desperation by eating her own hair.

95
00:07:25,321 --> 00:07:27,020
Give her a break, Frank.

96
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,625
She's falling apart.

97
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:31,215
You think Erica's lawyers are
gonna give her a break, Sean?

98
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,210
Annie would never
commit suicide, Julia.

99
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,110
- She knows we love her.
- They say it runs in the family.

100
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:39,320
I'm not the one who
keeps pulling up their roots...

101
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,056
and taking
them across country.

102
00:07:41,176 --> 00:07:42,595
Cool it, you two.

103
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,060
You're suing for joint
custody, remember?

104
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:48,505
If you guys are gonna have any chance
in hell of getting your kids back,

105
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:51,691
you're gonna have to bury the
hatchet and do it together.

106
00:07:52,747 --> 00:07:53,923
Julia,

107
00:07:55,067 --> 00:07:57,470
it's obvious
you're stressed out.

108
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,260
You look like you've aged
10 years in the last month.

109
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,820
Appearances matter, you guys.
We need to look strong...

110
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:08,560
and vibrant to combat
Erica's age and experience.

111
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,770
20456. McNamara.

112
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,340
Armed robbery. Arrested...

113
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,065
My son is being threatened.

114
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,079
Well, Dr. Troy, I
can assure you...

115
00:08:34,084 --> 00:08:36,244
we have zero-tolerance
for coercion.

116
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,051
You've gotta tell
Kessler because um,

117
00:08:40,171 --> 00:08:41,645
he didn't get the memo.

118
00:08:41,765 --> 00:08:44,230
Well, there's nothing
about it in his file.

119
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,201
You know, often new
prisoners feel a need...

120
00:08:47,206 --> 00:08:50,070
to prove themselves by
getting into scuffles.

121
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,375
I think that you know
that there is a law...

122
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,250
against 'deliberate indifference'
to potential prison rape.

123
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:58,380
Dr. Troy, I am anything but
indifferent to your son's welfare.

124
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,230
Well, then, you need to move
him to a different cell block.

125
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,350
Uh, a safer one.

126
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,607
- You want him in a safer cell?
- Yes

127
00:09:05,727 --> 00:09:09,170
Fine. Find me a half-million
dollars for some staff.

128
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,690
So there's not one guard to
every 60 of Kessler's posse,

129
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,865
and another 300 for
see-through doors on closets...

130
00:09:15,985 --> 00:09:17,885
and monitors in the showers,

131
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,540
so Kessler's wolves don't
attack without being seen.

132
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,640
I can manage $10,000.

133
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,000
A bribe?

134
00:09:28,102 --> 00:09:29,942
A contribution...

135
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,710
to prison reform.

136
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,025
I hate these.

137
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,330
I don't like causing you pain.

138
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,810
You heard what
the lawyer said.

139
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:05,120
We have to look youthful
and stress-free.

140
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,277
Whatever it takes,
that's my mantra.

141
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:13,510
Joint custody is gonna
be a very tough fight.

142
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,738
Yeah, but it doesn't mean
that we're gonna give up.

143
00:10:16,743 --> 00:10:18,995
You're their father.
I'm their mother.

144
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Sean, I need you.

145
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:25,290
The more united we are,
the better our odds.

146
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,700
What if we became a
real united front?

147
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,519
I mean, I gotta get out
of that Malibu place.

148
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,740
It's become a
middle-aged frat house.

149
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:40,295
What if I rented a
house and you moved in?

150
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,810
Sean, don't go there, please.

151
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,775
It's too late for you and me.

152
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:48,880
But we do know how to
be friends, all right?

153
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:52,280
And we have a serious
common goal here.

154
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:56,260
The lawyer said it.
Appearances are everything...

155
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,740
and you and I could just
take it as it comes.

156
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,469
But in the meantime,
we get our kids back.

157
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,800
What did you say
your mantra was?

158
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,655
Whatever it takes?

159
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,517
Whatever it takes.

160
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:28,735
I didn't think any
girl could be...

161
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,920
more beautiful
than your mother.

162
00:11:31,798 --> 00:11:33,190
I was wrong.

163
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,230
Thank you, Erica.

164
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:42,120
Renaldo picked this out.
Italians rule the world of fashion.

165
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,800
Beauty is their second language...

166
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,790
followed
by food and sex.

167
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:51,120
- I'm gonna go try on the others.
- Oh, marvelous.

168
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,240
We'll have a fashion show.

169
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,327
Hello?

170
00:11:58,447 --> 00:12:00,930
Where are the kids?
We have a surprise.

171
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,354
Oh, you're early.

172
00:12:02,474 --> 00:12:04,475
Annie's trying on her new clothes.

173
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,600
We've been buying
out Rodeo Drive.

174
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,400
And Conor's at his first
French horn lesson.

175
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:12,550
French horn? Why, he's a
little young, isn't he?

176
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:16,880
No. The horn will develop
his digital dexterity,

177
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,625
and his self-esteem.

178
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,959
Well, give me the address.
We'll pick him up.

179
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:22,666
We are going house hunting.

180
00:12:22,786 --> 00:12:25,251
We're, um, thinking
of renting a house...

181
00:12:25,371 --> 00:12:27,339
big enough
for the whole family.

182
00:12:29,451 --> 00:12:32,567
How many times will you
repeat the same mistake...

183
00:12:32,687 --> 00:12:36,032
without ever learning
anything from it?

184
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:39,945
Where's my daughter?

185
00:12:40,065 --> 00:12:42,671
Sean, if you really love her,
don't lure Annie

186
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:46,367
 into a fairy tale that has no
real hope of a happy ending.

187
00:13:17,668 --> 00:13:18,430
Hi.

188
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,660
Is it Thursday already?

189
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,360
Yeah, till midnight.

190
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,800
Um, sweetheart, we have the
whole afternoon together.

191
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:31,888
Awesome.

192
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,020
So, since we have all
that time together,

193
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,596
maybe you can come back
in a couple of hours.

194
00:13:38,716 --> 00:13:39,975
No. Now.

195
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:45,470
Cara mia, it's ok.
Go with Ma and Papa.

196
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,666
I'll be here when
you come back.

197
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:52,650
Annie, don't do this. Don't
make us beg for time with you.

198
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:58,370
Aw, Annie, that
dress is gorgeous.

199
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,700
Brings out the eyes.
Did you notice?

200
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:01,632
No.

201
00:14:02,643 --> 00:14:03,969
They never do.

202
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:08,580
Sweetie, we noticed--you
do, you look beautiful.

203
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,750
Whatever.
Look, just 2 hours.

204
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,034
We're in the middle
of a photo shoot.

205
00:14:13,154 --> 00:14:15,460
The camera.
It love her face.

206
00:14:17,628 --> 00:14:20,695
Ok.
Yeah, 2 hours.

207
00:14:21,143 --> 00:14:23,662
We'll come back.
Um, have fun.

208
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,139
Thanks.

209
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,530
This is a closed shoot.

210
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:33,082
Miss McNamara says no press.

211
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,424
Sorry.

212
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,566
So Sean...

213
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,180
I send you copies?

214
00:15:12,138 --> 00:15:14,780
I can't believe I'm gonna
lose Conor and Annie.

215
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,954
There's no way
a judge is gonna rule...

216
00:15:17,074 --> 00:15:19,539
against the mother and
the father of those 2 kids.

217
00:15:19,659 --> 00:15:21,094
When we went to pick
them up,

218
00:15:21,214 --> 00:15:23,285
Annie said she'd rather stay
with her grandmother.

219
00:15:23,405 --> 00:15:26,275
Oh, you know she doesn't mean that, Sean.
I mean, she's a teenager, right?

220
00:15:26,395 --> 00:15:29,049
Erica probably bribed her with a pony
or a Mini-Cooper or something.

221
00:15:29,169 --> 00:15:31,386
It's not going to last
long-term, trust me.

222
00:15:31,506 --> 00:15:33,876
You talk with Matt?
How's he holding up?

223
00:15:34,903 --> 00:15:37,058
He's fine.
He's doing fine.

224
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:41,200
Look, he's not the one I'm worried about.
I'm worried about you.

225
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,808
All right? You can't give up
on yourself again.

226
00:15:43,928 --> 00:15:46,211
You need to fight
back, be aggressive.

227
00:15:47,889 --> 00:15:49,790
McNamara.

228
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:52,710
Get your personals,
you're going on vacation.

229
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,195
I'm what?

230
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,693
You're being transferred.

231
00:15:55,813 --> 00:15:58,809
Oswald will take you to
your new cell. Get it moving.

232
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,960
Somebody must luuvve you.

233
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,749
Here you go.

234
00:16:38,005 --> 00:16:39,764
Is it just me in here now?

235
00:16:39,884 --> 00:16:40,925
Yep.

236
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:43,161
Your own bachelorette pad.

237
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,103
'nighty night.

238
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,881
What? You didn't
think I'd come...

239
00:16:49,886 --> 00:16:51,886
to the house warming party?

240
00:16:55,326 --> 00:16:57,497
After all, I did for you.

241
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,565
You gotta help me.

242
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:09,455
Please. You gotta help me.

243
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,305
Please.

244
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,485
Come on.

245
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:12,639
No, Denny.

246
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,270
Help me. Please.

247
00:17:35,401 --> 00:17:36,627
Hey, stranger.

248
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:40,554
Alex.
Wow, look at you.

249
00:17:41,108 --> 00:17:43,025
How's the healing going?

250
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,986
Well, the swelling's gone
down a little bit more...

251
00:17:45,991 --> 00:17:48,285
than I wanted, if
you know what I mean.

252
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:49,222
Well...

253
00:17:50,399 --> 00:17:52,040
Give it some time.

254
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,263
I don't know.

255
00:17:56,848 --> 00:17:59,177
I go into bars and...

256
00:17:59,676 --> 00:18:02,847
everyone automatically
sees a post-op transsexual.

257
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,810
Everybody knows that
I used to be a woman,

258
00:18:06,404 --> 00:18:08,612
and it's pretty
hard to explain...

259
00:18:08,617 --> 00:18:10,980
to them that I
was a man first.

260
00:18:11,561 --> 00:18:13,757
The only guys I
seem to attract...

261
00:18:13,762 --> 00:18:15,762
are the limp-wristed type.

262
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,900
Well, as Alexis you were into
straight guys and switching...

263
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:25,200
teams and going for
the gays could be, uh,

264
00:18:26,013 --> 00:18:27,730
problematic, I guess.

265
00:18:28,253 --> 00:18:31,460
My situation's a little
more complicated than that.

266
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:41,326
Hey, uh, I'm looking
for someone...

267
00:18:41,331 --> 00:18:43,255
I was told worked this shift.

268
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,105
You're lookin' at him, pal.

269
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,865
It's just me tonight.

270
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:50,640
Ok, uh, well, maybe you can
tell me when she'll be around.

271
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,840
Her name's Alexis.

272
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:58,220
That hot boy helped me
realize something...

273
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,810
I'm definitely gay, but
I only like straight guys...

274
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:06,174
or at least the guys
that want everyone...

275
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,179
to think they're straight.

276
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:10,831
Right, so you like
guys on the down low.

277
00:19:10,951 --> 00:19:12,837
What do you want me
to do about that?

278
00:19:12,957 --> 00:19:14,360
Meet me half-way.

279
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,450
Give me breast implants.

280
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,970
I'll grow out my hair.
I'll start dressing as a woman again...

281
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,731
You want to be a
chick-with-a-dick.

282
00:19:20,851 --> 00:19:22,704
I mean, can't you just
make up your mind?

283
00:19:22,824 --> 00:19:25,380
That's a very offensive
phrase, Dr. Troy.

284
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,149
In the trans world, that's
the equivalent of...

285
00:19:28,154 --> 00:19:30,395
calling an African-American
the 'n' word.

286
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,790
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

287
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:38,620
Maybe I changed my body as
an attempt to be accepted.

288
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,888
But I finally
realized that...

289
00:19:40,893 --> 00:19:43,916
I've always been
the same person on the inside...

290
00:19:44,036 --> 00:19:46,360
and i'm very proud of that.

291
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:50,530
Giving me boobs again isn't
gonna change who I am.

292
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:54,048
It's just gonna give
me a chance to be...

293
00:19:54,053 --> 00:19:56,590
with the people that
I need to be with.

294
00:20:16,183 --> 00:20:17,730
How did you get in here?

295
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,385
Yeah.

296
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:22,950
He wouldn't let me sign in
as a visiting physician.

297
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:29,730
You, um, break anything?

298
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,890
Any internal injuries?

299
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,210
Can you do me a favor?
Get me a sip of water.

300
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,740
They've got me kind
of shackled here.

301
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,940
Sure, yeah.

302
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:48,870
I got, uh, 4 fractured ribs,

303
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:54,260
a mild concussion--other
than that, I don't know.

304
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,285
Good?

305
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,275
Well, maybe I should talk
to the warden again...

306
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,165
and get this guy
transferred or something.

307
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,785
You wanna really help me out?

308
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:07,935
Of course.

309
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,040
Then do the operation.

310
00:21:12,322 --> 00:21:14,130
I'm serious.

311
00:21:20,247 --> 00:21:21,960
I know you're scared.

312
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:25,222
- I... I understand that...
- No, you can't.

313
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:30,180
You can't possibly understand
what I'm going through.

314
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:34,460
I'm not gonna be
safe anywhere now...

315
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:37,880
At least before,
I had protection,

316
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:40,043
but without Denny,
I'll be like...

317
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:42,328
fresh meat thrown to
a bunch of lions.

318
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,028
Can't you press
charges against him?

319
00:21:47,033 --> 00:21:49,913
I mean, at least then you
get protection, right?

320
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:53,450
There's no protection in here.

321
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,590
If I press charges,

322
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:02,180
and if Denny finds out,

323
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,440
there's not just gonna be a
beating next time, Christian.

324
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,060
You put pec implants in guys.

325
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,830
That's not the same
thing, and you know it.

326
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,040
Yeah, well, I don't
want to die, either.

327
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,170
Operation or not.

328
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,540
Denny's gonna have
his way with me, ok?

329
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,475
I know that and you know that.

330
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,583
So, unless you want
to visit me...

331
00:22:25,703 --> 00:22:27,854
in the morgue next time,
you do it.

332
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,695
Wow, look at this one.

333
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,180
It's just 3 blocks
from the beach.

334
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:47,030
Look at those views.

335
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:50,540
See? That could
be Conor's room.

336
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:53,030
That could be Annie's,

337
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:55,270
and this could be ours.

338
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,345
Isn't that a little pricey?

339
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:59,700
Especially if it's
only temporary.

340
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,380
Oh, come on.
Sit down.

341
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:06,680
We need to stay positive, now.

342
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,530
Santa Monica has a
great school district.

343
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,775
This place is
already furnished,

344
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:14,350
and you always said you
wanted a yard with a pool.

345
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:15,726
Now, you can get it.

346
00:23:15,846 --> 00:23:18,047
Well, that was when
the kids were young.

347
00:23:18,167 --> 00:23:20,968
What? You've lost your
fetish for skinny dipping?

348
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:23,510
I'm not gonna be
doing that now.

349
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:26,120
Why not?
Those days are over?

350
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:29,050
Oh, so is that your plan?

351
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:34,200
I just think this would be
a great place for all of us.

352
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,680
The family.

353
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:39,010
And we agreed,

354
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,020
if we're gonna make this work,

355
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:44,110
we have to commit
ourselves 100%.

356
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:49,680
Financially and emotionally.

357
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:54,030
Whatever it takes?

358
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:19,180
We need to get that out of
the way sooner or later, huh?

359
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:27,120
Hey, you're not gonna get
all weird on me now, are you?

360
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:35,140
I'm just nervous about
losing the kids, that's all.

361
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:38,470
I don't want to make
any wrong moves.

362
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:43,350
We're not gonna lose the
kids because we had sex.

363
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:50,850
I just don't want to
take any more chances.

364
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:54,635
That's why we need
to play dirty...

365
00:24:55,232 --> 00:24:56,889
just like Erica.

366
00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:00,588
- What?
- I'm gonna show you something.

367
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,435
What is this?

368
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,794
Open it.

369
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:23,295
Cocaine.

370
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,685
Christian got it for me.

371
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,930
He knows a dealer
at some strip club.

372
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:29,560
If you get busted with that,
they book you for distribution.

373
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,720
Carries a mandatory
10-year sentence.

374
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:34,220
What the hell are
you doing with this?

375
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,790
It's not mine. It's
Renaldo's...

376
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:40,031
at least it will be after I plant it
on him and call the police.

377
00:25:40,151 --> 00:25:41,495
Are you insane?

378
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,401
Are you forgetting what
that asshole did...

379
00:25:43,406 --> 00:25:45,175
to me with the camera?
The whole set-up?

380
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,796
We can't play by
the rules anymore.

381
00:25:46,801 --> 00:25:48,325
Julia, there's
too much at stake.

382
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:50,165
Sean. You're
risking everything.

383
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:51,665
Now hold on a second...

384
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:54,730
Just give this to me... Jesus.

385
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,880
That cost me 2 grand.

386
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:01,760
Fine, we'll have to
rent a smaller house.

387
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:38,330
Renaldo?

388
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,640
Amore.

389
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:54,800
Renaldo? Are you
hiding something?

390
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,398
Oh, no, no.

391
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,282
A surprise for later.

392
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:02,930
Surpresa? Well, I think
I'd like my surprise now.

393
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:07,250
In the moonlight with music...

394
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:10,490
- Renaldo.
- Amore.

395
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,439
Show me.

396
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,294
Later...

397
00:27:17,798 --> 00:27:19,482
In a romantic moment

398
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:22,070
What have you got
in your pocket?

399
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:31,290
We weren't doing anything.

400
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:34,940
I mean, you know, he would
pose me, to make me look hot.

401
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,645
How hot?

402
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:42,400
Uh, did he ever touch you
in an inappropriate way?

403
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:45,540
I never touched her.
Do you think I'm a monster?

404
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,745
Get out.

405
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,964
Erica, are you mad
at me because...

406
00:27:49,969 --> 00:27:52,009
he spends more time
with me than you?

407
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,990
Don't be ridiculous.

408
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,107
It's just if...

409
00:28:00,241 --> 00:28:02,892
anything ever happened
between you...

410
00:28:03,012 --> 00:28:04,815
that felt uncomfortable.

411
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:08,541
You'd tell me, wouldn't you?

412
00:28:11,303 --> 00:28:13,508
You have to tell me, Annie.

413
00:28:14,105 --> 00:28:16,989
Didn't you hear me?
I never touched her.

414
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:20,960
- You're the only one I love.
- I'm the only one.

415
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:24,192
You were thinking of me
while you were masturbating...

416
00:28:24,312 --> 00:28:26,408
into my granddaughter's panties?

417
00:28:26,528 --> 00:28:29,580
I want you out of this house,
out of my life.

418
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:34,180
And if you don't get out right now,
I'm calling the police.

419
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:42,520
My fantasy,
it's still in my head.

420
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:46,020
Yours?
Standing before you.

421
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,813
Who's the sick one?

422
00:28:48,373 --> 00:28:49,603
I ask you.

423
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:00,179
Absolutely.
No, I agree...

424
00:29:03,271 --> 00:29:06,387
I asked Annie to take Conor
to the beach so...

425
00:29:06,887 --> 00:29:08,227
we could talk.

426
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,560
I've been to court.

427
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,010
They're ours.

428
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,260
Annie and Conor.

429
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:31,570
She gave up custody.

430
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,375
Why, Erica?

431
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:36,440
Why would you do a kind
and decent thing like that?

432
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,750
I've left Renaldo.

433
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:42,028
Did you catch him playing with
someone from his own generation?

434
00:29:42,148 --> 00:29:45,993
We never appear as old to
ourselves as we do to others.

435
00:29:47,345 --> 00:29:50,810
"As we age, we hover
between fool and sage."

436
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,830
Oh, come on, mother,
that's not true.

437
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,915
You were never a sage.

438
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,545
Julia, I love my
grandchildren.

439
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:59,855
If I thought I was
endangering them in any way...

440
00:29:59,975 --> 00:30:01,366
Endangering them, how?

441
00:30:01,486 --> 00:30:03,339
I didn't mean "endangering".

442
00:30:03,459 --> 00:30:05,920
We live in a
hyper-sexualized culture.

443
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:09,070
Naturally, the adolescent
delights in her...

444
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:13,740
newly discovered ability to
control through her sexuality.

445
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,395
- Are you talking about Annie?
- Did something happen?

446
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,520
No, no. I'm positive.

447
00:30:20,676 --> 00:30:22,480
Did Renaldo touch her?

448
00:30:22,856 --> 00:30:23,935
Did he?

449
00:30:24,055 --> 00:30:28,950
I found him with...her
underpants, ejaculating.

450
00:30:32,317 --> 00:30:35,190
Get out of here.

451
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,301
And you better buy Renaldo
a one-way ticket...

452
00:30:42,306 --> 00:30:44,706
back to whatever hole
he crawled out of.

453
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:55,565
Are you sure about this?

454
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:57,507
You're not gonna change
your mind and...

455
00:30:57,627 --> 00:30:59,429
decide something else
a month from now?

456
00:30:59,549 --> 00:31:00,860
I'm still me,

457
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,825
even if my sexual
identity is,...

458
00:31:04,703 --> 00:31:06,096
well, fluid.

459
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,231
Those, I mean.

460
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,840
They're just silicone bags.

461
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:16,450
They can take 'em
out again, right?

462
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,854
Right.

463
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,069
Lizzie?

464
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:25,707
Ok, count backwards for me.

465
00:31:36,987 --> 00:31:38,098
10 blade.

466
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,711
Let's raise up our
lady-boy and...

467
00:32:18,716 --> 00:32:20,716
see if her boobies are even.

468
00:32:50,021 --> 00:32:53,800
How long will it be before
I can take off the bandages?

469
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,940
Christian.

470
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:00,990
Christian.

471
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,540
How long will it be before
I can take off the bandages?

472
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,760
Christian?

473
00:33:10,623 --> 00:33:12,340
4 to 5 days...

474
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,350
after the swelling and
soreness goes down,

475
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:18,770
you can come back in and
I'll take off the bandages.

476
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,154
The last time, I
was showing off...

477
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:25,135
my new titties within a week.

478
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:28,520
Then again, I was on
estrogen and progestin.

479
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:32,370
Progestin would stop me from
having an erection, right?

480
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:37,390
Warren wouldn't like it
if I killed my libido.

481
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,165
What did she say?

482
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:06,375
I told her I wasn't
doing the surgery.

483
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:09,530
Do you have any idea
what you're doing to me?

484
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,609
Yes.

485
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,490
I'm offering you
a better solution.

486
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,820
Uh, I put all your meds
in your make-up bag.

487
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:52,260
Mother, it's a 12-hour
flight to Milan.

488
00:34:52,265 --> 00:34:54,225
What if your arthritis acts up

489
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:56,520
and you need a
Darvocet or something?

490
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,317
Oh, of course.

491
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,240
I'm just not thinking.

492
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:04,345
I seem to have been doing
a lot of that these days.

493
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:07,130
No one tells you
how to grow old.

494
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:11,150
One day you discover you
can't be who you are anymore.

495
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,432
Inside you still
see yourself as...

496
00:35:14,437 --> 00:35:16,910
brilliant,
dazzling, beautiful.

497
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:21,380
But the mirror
makes a fool of you.

498
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:24,220
No one is ever over
40 in their dreams.

499
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,235
That's your cab.

500
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,500
Julia, I can't undo
what I've already done,

501
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:31,790
but...

502
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:35,536
I can face up to it,

503
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:40,660
and tell the truth, and
ask you to forgive me.

504
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:43,390
I am not here to
forgive you, Mother.

505
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:46,430
I am here to get rid of
you, to pack you up...

506
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,125
and tell you never
to contact me...

507
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:51,510
or any member of
my family again.

508
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,660
Think about what
you're saying.

509
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,940
Can you live with
that decision?

510
00:35:55,943 --> 00:35:58,930
I can't possibly
live without it.

511
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:01,370
You're dead to me, Mother.

512
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:05,570
When I close that cab door,
I'm shutting your coffin.

513
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:07,650
Let's go.

514
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,530
We don't want you
to miss your plane.

515
00:36:28,114 --> 00:36:29,810
Honey, I'm home.

516
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:35,550
Lockdown 11C.

517
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:42,594
I got you a little something.

518
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,552
Try it on.

519
00:36:53,591 --> 00:36:55,420
It's not really gonna fit.

520
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:59,190
Put it on and hurry up.

521
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:29,410
Ooh, I like it.

522
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:32,230
Looks so good.

523
00:37:33,064 --> 00:37:34,960
Turn around.

524
00:37:48,414 --> 00:37:49,790
Damn it.

525
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:53,770
I don't know what
the hell is wrong.

526
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:57,830
It's ok. It happens
to a lot of guys.

527
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:01,850
You keep your mouth shut.

528
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:04,166
If you'd got the
titties like I told you,

529
00:38:04,286 --> 00:38:06,520
there wouldn't have
been any problem.

530
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,316
My dad said it's gonna
take a little more time.

531
00:38:09,436 --> 00:38:11,558
The warden still
has to approve it.

532
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:14,690
Oh, and she will.
You can count on it.

533
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,979
Do you... do you
want a ho ho?

534
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:23,690
That always makes
you feel better.

535
00:38:25,003 --> 00:38:26,164
Yeah, ok.

536
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:31,260
A little chocolaty goodness
would go down right now.

537
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:35,699
It's ok. I've got
it all right here.

538
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,705
You're sweet.

539
00:38:47,228 --> 00:38:50,178
- Shit.
- What the hell are these?

540
00:38:52,214 --> 00:38:54,236
What are you doing with these?

541
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,745
Provera.

542
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,560
They give this
shit to rapists.

543
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:04,630
It's chemical castration.

544
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,750
Jesus, how long have you
been giving me this stuff?

545
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:12,095
You think just because
I can't get hard...

546
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:16,000
that I won't bang that tight
little succulent ass of yours?

547
00:39:17,715 --> 00:39:20,240
Take off your god damn pants.

548
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:26,630
I'll teach you
to mess with me.

549
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,853
No.

550
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:11,530
Bag check.

551
00:40:12,301 --> 00:40:13,639
Is this your bag?

552
00:40:13,759 --> 00:40:15,365
Huh? yes.

553
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:18,130
May I ask what it is
you're looking for?

554
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,613
What's this?

555
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:37,976
I have no idea.

556
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:54,841
It gives me great
peace of mind to see...

557
00:40:55,504 --> 00:40:58,920
how thorough you are,
but my plane is due to board.

558
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:00,865
You have the right
to remain silent.

559
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:03,005
Anything you say can
and will be used...

560
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:05,625
against you in a court of
law. Do you understand?

561
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,830
What is this pertaining to?

562
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:11,250
The half-kilo of cocaine we
found in your purse, Miss.

563
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,160
Uh, I put all your meds
in your make-up bag.

564
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:21,660
It's a 12-hour
flight to Milan.

565
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:23,763
What if your arthritis acts up...

566
00:41:23,768 --> 00:41:25,988
and you need a
Darvocet or something?

567
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:30,043
You have the right to
consult an attorney...

568
00:41:30,163 --> 00:41:32,347
before speaking to the
police, and have...

569
00:41:32,467 --> 00:41:34,700
an attorney present
during questioning,...

570
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:37,187
now and in the future.
Do you understand?

571
00:41:38,021 --> 00:41:40,988
