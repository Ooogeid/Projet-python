2
00:00:01,941 --> 00:00:05,291
You know how they say when you find your Bliss
is when the Money starts rolling in?

3
00:00:05,411 --> 00:00:07,399
Mine is so amazing, man.

4
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:12,241
It takes us beyond our petty egos,
beyond language and unifies us.

5
00:00:12,361 --> 00:00:15,000
Either pay your share
of the rent by sundown

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,030
or you can sleep on the beach
with all the other freaks.

7
00:00:20,826 --> 00:00:23,776
Daddy, my stomach!
It hurts so much.

8
00:00:24,054 --> 00:00:27,747
It's an intestinal condition,
resulting from the consumption of hair.

9
00:00:28,744 --> 00:00:30,735
what?!
Annie, how did this happen?

10
00:00:30,803 --> 00:00:32,935
I just pull it out. That's all.

11
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:37,342
Dixie, is that you?

12
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:40,359
Oh, you look fantastic as a brunette.

13
00:00:40,736 --> 00:00:42,747
No, I'm Teddy.
Teddy Row.

14
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,391
I need you to stay still
Mrs. Reinhold.

15
00:00:48,454 --> 00:00:51,675
- We eloped 2 days ago.
- Is this a joke?

16
00:00:51,795 --> 00:00:54,079
Just spit it out.
You don't like her? I don't care.

17
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:57,611
I just hope you didn't put
any of your stuff in her name.

18
00:00:57,731 --> 00:00:59,163
Maybe it's better you weren't there.

19
00:00:59,231 --> 00:01:01,814
"Make sure she can't touch your money"
would have been a lousy toast.

20
00:01:01,934 --> 00:01:04,208
I am doubling my life insurance policy.

21
00:01:04,328 --> 00:01:06,537
Making Connor and Annie sole
beneficiaries.

22
00:01:06,605 --> 00:01:10,189
what if Annie stayed with us
For a couple of months?

23
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:12,677
Connor can come out too.

24
00:01:13,279 --> 00:01:17,442
I have worked too hard
to leave my family with nothing.

25
00:01:27,092 --> 00:01:29,441
You're up early.
It's almost 11:00.

26
00:01:29,561 --> 00:01:31,029
Do we have any coffee?

27
00:01:31,096 --> 00:01:32,030
mm-hmm.

28
00:01:32,844 --> 00:01:35,224
I saved you some of the paper.

29
00:01:35,344 --> 00:01:37,723
It's the "help wanted" section.

30
00:01:37,843 --> 00:01:40,274
About time you got a real job.

31
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:48,405
- What's this?
- It's $850.

32
00:01:48,914 --> 00:01:50,963
Or as you and Christian
like to call it: rent.

33
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:52,494
I have a real job.

34
00:01:52,614 --> 00:01:55,238
That's 2 months in a row
I've made now.

35
00:01:55,358 --> 00:01:57,993
Oh, wait a second.
Did I hear you say you're paying the rent

36
00:01:58,113 --> 00:02:00,759
without another threat of homelessness?
Give me a look at this stuff.

37
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,505
Smell likes real money.
Looks like real money.

38
00:02:05,327 --> 00:02:08,501
of course it's real.
And Here. Here's a little extra.

39
00:02:08,621 --> 00:02:12,063
Why don't you get some real
coffee around here from now on? This stuff sucks.

40
00:02:12,183 --> 00:02:13,997
where'd you get all this money?

41
00:02:14,117 --> 00:02:17,320
where do you think?
From practicing my craft.

42
00:02:18,143 --> 00:02:20,120
Craft?
You mean miming?

43
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,145
that's right.

44
00:02:21,676 --> 00:02:25,538
I heard about you!
The mime robbing people.

45
00:02:28,279 --> 00:02:30,949
You don't scare me!

46
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,181
Let me get this straight:

47
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:49,126
People actually pay

48
00:02:49,942 --> 00:02:51,042
to see you perform?

49
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:54,293
Yeah. Mimes are back,
Christian in a big way.

50
00:02:54,413 --> 00:02:57,229
Thanks to you two,
all the greats are being rediscovered:

51
00:02:57,349 --> 00:02:59,751
Marcel Marceau,
Shields et Yarnell.

52
00:03:00,662 --> 00:03:02,357
I'm just carrying on the tradition.

53
00:03:02,477 --> 00:03:05,510
well, you must be pretty good
if you're getting paid like this.

54
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,755
I am.

55
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:09,737
I make enough to pay my rent
and support my child.

56
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:13,896
Please let me see her on saturday.
I was going to take her to the Pier.

57
00:03:14,016 --> 00:03:16,634
Forget it dead beat dad.

58
00:03:17,217 --> 00:03:21,336
You know, you are 5 months
behind on your child support.

59
00:03:21,456 --> 00:03:24,949
I'm working my fingers to the
bone to pay for her childcare.

60
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:27,465
No. I'm sorry, I pay for everything.

61
00:03:29,132 --> 00:03:32,231
So, you consider
this your last visit

62
00:03:32,351 --> 00:03:33,918
until you pay up.

63
00:03:37,248 --> 00:03:40,358
Here.
I'll pick her up at 9:00 A.M.

64
00:03:40,426 --> 00:03:43,292
You make sure she's ready.
Am I clear?

65
00:03:44,029 --> 00:03:46,705
where did you get this cash?

66
00:03:47,566 --> 00:03:50,172
- we should come see you perform.
- That's a good idea.

67
00:03:50,292 --> 00:03:52,024
You just Stand on the venice
boardwalk, right?

68
00:03:52,144 --> 00:03:55,181
- You don't have to do that.
- We're proud of you, Matt.

69
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:57,957
I mean it seems like you finally
found something you really like doing.

70
00:03:58,077 --> 00:04:00,276
And you're making money,
which I'm very impressed with.

71
00:04:00,396 --> 00:04:01,922
Even if you are a clown.

72
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:04,198
Mimes aren't clowns.

73
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:05,765
I'm an artist.

74
00:04:06,118 --> 00:04:07,846
we just want to show
our support.

75
00:04:08,187 --> 00:04:09,204
You know, we can come down,

76
00:04:09,474 --> 00:04:12,124
all get lunch together
and make a day of it.

77
00:04:12,244 --> 00:04:14,372
Look, I don't want you to.
Ok?

78
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:16,794
Look, you guys have never supported me.
Not once.

79
00:04:16,914 --> 00:04:19,345
I don't need you to start now.

80
00:04:19,465 --> 00:04:22,063
I mean, really man.
Isn't the money enough?

86
00:05:17,627 --> 00:05:20,761
They've expired. It's a waste.
We don't need this much lidocaine, all right.

87
00:05:20,881 --> 00:05:23,016
We should just cut back
until things pick up.

88
00:05:23,136 --> 00:05:25,439
We just cut back on
the epinephrine and the atropine.

89
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:29,049
I don't want to risk not having
what we need in case of an emergency.

90
00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:31,210
What about the Pre-filled
syringes--

91
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:34,000
Outdated. All of it, ok?
It's money just thrown away.

92
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:37,174
I mean, maybe with the rent
going up on the malibu house,

93
00:05:37,294 --> 00:05:39,930
we should just do surgeries there,
we'd save a bundle.

94
00:05:44,571 --> 00:05:46,772
you know,
I should just tell you:

95
00:05:47,361 --> 00:05:49,501
Teddy's place sold.

96
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:56,028
And we made an offer
on a really great place we saw,

97
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:57,891
Santa Monica adjacent.

98
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,518
well, that's great.

99
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:04,358
I mean, I'm fine.
I'll be fine. You know.

100
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:07,963
I'm not gonna let rent get in
the way of you moving on with your life.

101
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,646
I think it's great.

102
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:13,788
whoo. I gotta go.

103
00:06:14,265 --> 00:06:16,302
so, when's Connor's flight get in?

104
00:06:16,422 --> 00:06:17,843
uh, 11:10.

105
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:21,686
I can't wait for Teddy to meet
the little guy.

106
00:06:22,956 --> 00:06:26,267
You know, she's really excited about
becoming a part of this whole new family.

107
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:28,111
I guess that doesn't include me

108
00:06:28,231 --> 00:06:30,572
because she doesn't give a
shit about getting to know me.

109
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,456
you just have to give it a little time.

110
00:06:34,908 --> 00:06:38,807
You guys got off to a rocky start.
You didn't like her from the beginning.

111
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,073
You know...

112
00:06:44,193 --> 00:06:48,123
Teddy is planning a little family
brunch to welcome Connor to L.A.

113
00:06:48,243 --> 00:06:52,178
- Why don't you come?
- you know, maybe later.

114
00:06:52,298 --> 00:06:55,414
She Should--she should get to know
the kids first.

115
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:21,907
one more.

116
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,510
Bad day, doc?

117
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:26,279
Bad year.

118
00:07:26,347 --> 00:07:28,318
Don't mean to make it any worse.

119
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:32,275
But, uh, you need to close out your tab.
It's been a couple of months now.

120
00:07:32,395 --> 00:07:34,552
Boss has been on me about it.

121
00:07:35,302 --> 00:07:37,805
when's the boss gonna get
some new talent around here?

122
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:39,940
I mean, these old whores are
getting tired.

123
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,255
couple of new girls on a
break right now.

124
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,043
One of 'em is kinda skinny.
But the other one...

125
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:46,299
Right up your alley.

126
00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:50,174
A huge talent.
Juggernaut talent, truthfully.

127
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:53,792
what's her name?

128
00:07:53,912 --> 00:07:56,743
Jenny.
Jenny Juggs.

129
00:07:58,365 --> 00:08:00,596
Well, why don't you run along
And tell Jenny Juggs

130
00:08:00,716 --> 00:08:03,989
to brush her teeth and
meet me in the V.I.P. Room?

131
00:08:05,677 --> 00:08:08,588
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'll pay the tab before I go.

132
00:08:14,134 --> 00:08:15,624
Are those real?

133
00:08:19,618 --> 00:08:23,102
ahh. No touching.

134
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,539
No touching. No, no.

135
00:08:27,047 --> 00:08:28,724
You like my boobies?

136
00:08:29,043 --> 00:08:29,976
Yeah.

137
00:08:30,044 --> 00:08:30,843
You do don't you.

138
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:35,429
'cause you're a very nasty
little boy.

139
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:37,350
Just a little feel?

140
00:08:37,418 --> 00:08:40,538
I mean, I gotta see if
those babies are real, huh? Huh?

141
00:08:41,994 --> 00:08:45,406
did you hear me?
This is not the goddamn farmers market,

142
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:47,954
you pervert,
You can't go squeezing the melons.

143
00:08:48,074 --> 00:08:49,182
Get the hell off me!

144
00:08:49,302 --> 00:08:51,564
This is bullshit. Freak.
I'm not paying for this.

145
00:08:51,684 --> 00:08:53,858
I'm not a hooker,
I'm a performer.

146
00:08:53,978 --> 00:08:55,802
you got some delusions of
Grandma sister!

147
00:08:56,325 --> 00:08:57,724
I'm sorry.

148
00:08:57,844 --> 00:09:02,408
I'm very Sorry. Ok?
This is my first day.

149
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:05,491
I'm a little defensive.
Ok?

150
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:08,948
I'll be nice, ok?
I'm sorry.

151
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:11,250
I'll let you touch 'em.

152
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:12,752
You want to touch 'em?

153
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,964
you know what, sweetcheeks?
I'm over it.

154
00:09:15,341 --> 00:09:18,628
But my name's Dr. Christian Troy.
I'm a plastic Surgeon.

155
00:09:18,748 --> 00:09:21,220
You should call me, all right?

156
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:24,712
So I can do something with
these gravity bags.

157
00:09:24,832 --> 00:09:27,357
They must be killing your back.

158
00:09:31,215 --> 00:09:32,354
I deserved that.

159
00:09:32,474 --> 00:09:34,874
Ok.
I totally deserved that.

160
00:09:35,753 --> 00:09:39,956
Just stay.
Don't get me fired.

161
00:09:41,058 --> 00:09:42,748
And I'll let you touch 'em.

162
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:45,123
And you'll like it a lot

163
00:09:45,243 --> 00:09:47,437
You want to do that?

164
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:55,075
Yeah. Put your face right
in the middle of them.

165
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:04,700
How do you like them gravity
bags, shitface?!

166
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,796
Are you going to eat those
eggs or make a sculpture of them?

167
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,534
I don't eat unborn chickens.

168
00:10:15,635 --> 00:10:20,453
This is an unfertilized globule
of albumen and protein.

169
00:10:20,573 --> 00:10:23,956
It comes out of the same opening
that a chicken poops out of.

170
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:26,225
Once the mother hen lays it,

171
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,900
she promptly runs away
with great relief:

172
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,073
this egg is never going
to be a chicken.

173
00:10:31,193 --> 00:10:32,555
It is never going to feel pain.

174
00:10:32,675 --> 00:10:35,301
And it is never going
to have a soul.

175
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:37,033
Now eat.

176
00:10:37,153 --> 00:10:38,100
I'm not hungry.

177
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,945
Perhaps mademoiselle McNamara
would enjoy her eggs more

178
00:10:41,065 --> 00:10:43,436
if there was a hunk of hair
mixed in.

179
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:46,539
Hello!
Anybody home?

180
00:10:46,659 --> 00:10:50,316
Aww.
This must be Connor.

181
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,335
He's a little shy with
new people.

182
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:57,476
Maybe he just senses evil.

183
00:10:57,596 --> 00:11:00,187
Annie, for god sake!

184
00:11:00,307 --> 00:11:01,894
She been giving you a hard time?

185
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:03,669
She's a 13 year old.
It's her job.

186
00:11:04,298 --> 00:11:05,665
I wish I had your patience.

187
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:09,576
Well, you were never a Teenage girl.
Lucky me.

188
00:11:12,014 --> 00:11:16,175
Connor, this is Teddy.

189
00:11:16,243 --> 00:11:16,943
Hey.

190
00:11:17,891 --> 00:11:20,296
You're so handsome.
Just like your dad.

191
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,563
Wow.
You sure have a way with him.

192
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:25,057
Annie, you want to drop the
attitude for 5 minutes

193
00:11:25,177 --> 00:11:27,220
and try to be a part
of this family?

194
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:29,648
she's not my family.

195
00:11:30,547 --> 00:11:33,550
She's right.
I am the monster

196
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:37,170
Who dared have her sit
and eat some eggs.

197
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:40,199
Anytime I exert
any authority over her,

198
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:42,959
she thinks I'm trying
to take the place of her mom.

199
00:11:46,161 --> 00:11:48,207
You know, I was thinking...

200
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:51,911
Maybe we could just start over.

201
00:11:51,979 --> 00:11:54,180
You know, get to know each other

202
00:11:54,248 --> 00:11:57,026
in a new environment where there
aren't so many memories.

203
00:11:57,584 --> 00:11:59,085
Go some place together.

204
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:01,308
You mean like a family
vacation?

205
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:03,122
Sounds like fun.

206
00:12:04,037 --> 00:12:06,340
You know, Connor's
never been to Disneyland.

207
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,069
Disneyland blows.

208
00:12:08,189 --> 00:12:10,029
Disney World's twice as good.

209
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:11,762
Only half as many people
get hurt each year.

210
00:12:11,882 --> 00:12:14,828
I'm with Annie on this one.
Disneyland does blow.

211
00:12:16,247 --> 00:12:18,785
I was thinking more
along the lines of something

212
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:21,307
kind of... adventurous.

213
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,109
Like a camping trip.

214
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:25,959
camping?
Like in the outdoors?

215
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,581
Yeah.
Like in the outdoors.

216
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:30,621
Well, that sounds great.

217
00:12:30,741 --> 00:12:33,154
It'd be something new,
wouldn't it?

218
00:12:33,274 --> 00:12:35,698
I think it's a fantastic idea.

219
00:12:36,467 --> 00:12:38,024
Shake things up a bit,

220
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,725
Give us all a chance to connect
in a new way.

221
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:44,715
Honey, give her a chance, ok?

222
00:12:46,286 --> 00:12:47,382
For me.

223
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,637
Sounds to me you like you had
it coming.

224
00:12:54,757 --> 00:12:57,257
when I go to a strip club,
I'm paying to objectify women.

225
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:58,411
That's the whole goddamn point.

226
00:12:58,531 --> 00:13:02,070
It's the only place this side of Bangkok,
where a man can actually act like a man.

227
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:05,255
I'm not letting Jenny Juggs
ruin our last man oasis.

228
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:07,401
Still, you probably shouldn't
have said what you said.

229
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:09,255
I should have said
something much worse.

230
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:13,240
The only reason she's working there is so she can
get rid of her angry feminist agenda bullshit.

231
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,745
She's a tit terrorist.
She's Valerie solanas with beach balls.

232
00:13:16,865 --> 00:13:18,030
Valerie who?

233
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:20,113
Famous man-hater who shot
Warhol.

234
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:22,886
I don't understand.
She punched you in the face with her breasts?

235
00:13:23,006 --> 00:13:25,824
Yes! She punched me in the
face with her breasts.

236
00:13:25,944 --> 00:13:27,801
And I'm not...

237
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,987
It's not funny.

238
00:13:31,107 --> 00:13:33,594
I'm not the only one,
there are other victims.

239
00:13:33,714 --> 00:13:35,481
You can come and take a look.
I'm serious.

240
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:38,317
It's not... Come here, I'll show you.

241
00:13:47,008 --> 00:13:50,683
You think you're
so scary don't ya?

242
00:13:50,803 --> 00:13:52,846
Those things must weigh
50 pounds.

243
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:55,996
Glaring at us women,
smiling...

244
00:13:56,116 --> 00:13:57,661
she's talking to a pumpkin.

245
00:13:57,781 --> 00:14:02,040
I said stop Smiling!
You want my tricks and treats?

246
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,656
Well, I'm here to tell you

247
00:14:04,776 --> 00:14:07,680
I am no man's trick.

248
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:14,221
And that is the only treat
that you deserve.

249
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:19,134
A lesson in how to
treat women.

250
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,543
- You see? Those are deadly weapons.
- what are you going to do?

251
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:25,897
I'm gonna have her arrested
for assault and battery.

252
00:14:26,017 --> 00:14:27,626
She needs to be taught a lesson.

253
00:14:27,746 --> 00:14:30,702
She needs to learn that
crime doesn't pay.

254
00:14:35,961 --> 00:14:37,553
You see,
this is a great app.

255
00:14:37,621 --> 00:14:39,647
You can alter photographs,

256
00:14:39,767 --> 00:14:42,485
I look kind of sad here.
So I swipe it.

257
00:14:42,605 --> 00:14:44,407
And I'm smiling.

258
00:14:44,527 --> 00:14:45,527
That's cool.

259
00:14:46,545 --> 00:14:48,880
I need to see Dr. Troy
right away.

260
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,900
Do you have an appointment?

261
00:14:49,949 --> 00:14:52,832
No. But I need to talk to him
today as soon as possible.

262
00:14:52,952 --> 00:14:55,990
ok. Well, why don't you just
take a seat.

263
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,255
And what's your name?

264
00:14:57,375 --> 00:15:00,790
Jennifer Juggs. Ok?

265
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,727
And I'm not leaving
until I see him.

266
00:15:02,847 --> 00:15:06,011
All right, well, she's gonna call
the doctor. You go take a seat.

267
00:15:08,952 --> 00:15:10,568
I just have his voicemail--

268
00:15:10,636 --> 00:15:13,829
Dr. Troy, I just barely
made bail

269
00:15:13,949 --> 00:15:17,556
after spending the whole night
in a freakin' cell!

270
00:15:17,676 --> 00:15:20,245
I just lost
my freakin' job too!

271
00:15:20,365 --> 00:15:23,038
ok--all right. Take a seat or
I'll call security.

272
00:15:23,158 --> 00:15:26,132
you obviously don't know who
you're talking to.

273
00:15:26,252 --> 00:15:29,001
clearly a person with poor
people skills.

274
00:15:29,121 --> 00:15:31,122
People skills?

275
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:33,524
Want to see some people skills?

276
00:15:42,198 --> 00:15:44,583
Are you the world's most
self-destructive woman or what?

277
00:15:44,703 --> 00:15:47,268
I know, ok?
I know. I know.

278
00:15:47,388 --> 00:15:50,195
I have rage issues.
But that's why I'm here.

279
00:15:50,315 --> 00:15:53,251
I'll pay for your phone,
Dr. Troy.

280
00:15:53,371 --> 00:15:55,480
I just need some help.

281
00:15:55,547 --> 00:15:56,640
Damn right you need some help.

282
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,616
Dr. Epstein is just down
the hallway.

283
00:15:58,736 --> 00:16:01,340
He's a very well respected shrink.
He deals with...

284
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,546
you know...
body image issues.

285
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,592
It's so much bigger than that.

286
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,803
What color are my eyes?

287
00:16:08,923 --> 00:16:09,707
I don't know.

288
00:16:09,827 --> 00:16:11,085
They're blue!

289
00:16:11,954 --> 00:16:14,128
And they're really pretty!

290
00:16:17,384 --> 00:16:19,267
But no one's ever gonna know that.

291
00:16:19,387 --> 00:16:21,955
All they know is my juggs
is gigantic.

292
00:16:27,579 --> 00:16:29,921
If you ask anyone
in my 10th grade class,

293
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:33,746
what they remember
about Jenny Jarvis...

294
00:16:35,921 --> 00:16:39,063
First, they'll laugh uncomfortably.

295
00:16:39,825 --> 00:16:41,492
And then they'll say:

296
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,457
"her humungous tits."

297
00:16:46,598 --> 00:16:48,866
And that's it.

298
00:16:48,934 --> 00:16:50,568
'cause that's who I am.

299
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:52,970
And that's all I'll ever be.

300
00:16:56,742 --> 00:16:59,772
I need you to give me
a breast reduction.

301
00:17:02,524 --> 00:17:04,800
Why would you work at
a strip club, huh?

302
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,876
It's the one place where people actually
pay to look at your breasts.

303
00:17:07,996 --> 00:17:09,585
It's a little counter-intuitive,
don't you think?

304
00:17:09,705 --> 00:17:12,304
what else am I gonna do?

305
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:15,983
You gonna hire me to be
you receptionist?

306
00:17:16,103 --> 00:17:19,074
sweetheart after what you've
done to my t-2 and my telephone,

307
00:17:19,194 --> 00:17:22,303
I don't think I'm the right guy
to be asking.

308
00:17:23,461 --> 00:17:27,389
I know that I seem a little
bitter and angry.

309
00:17:27,509 --> 00:17:29,307
I need you to believe me that

310
00:17:29,427 --> 00:17:32,143
I have really tried
to embrace myself.

311
00:17:32,211 --> 00:17:34,648
I've tried to do some
standup comedy

312
00:17:34,768 --> 00:17:36,255
and some performance art.

313
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:37,829
Is that what you call
those videos?

314
00:17:37,949 --> 00:17:42,016
Comedy and performance art?
You are a sick, angry person.

315
00:17:43,448 --> 00:17:45,442
You need to be taught a lesson.

316
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:52,518
I thought you were a doctor,
and I thought

317
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,525
that you would want to heal me

318
00:17:54,645 --> 00:17:56,834
instead of trying to punish me.

319
00:18:00,251 --> 00:18:03,574
Ok.
Can I get a little help?

320
00:18:03,642 --> 00:18:08,242
I've got mess kits,
4 sleeping bags,

321
00:18:08,362 --> 00:18:12,791
coleman lamp, and other
odds and ends.

322
00:18:18,503 --> 00:18:20,725
Annie doesn't want to go.

323
00:18:21,445 --> 00:18:23,542
I'll bring all this stuff back.

324
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:28,060
Is it bugs?
Her allergies?

325
00:18:28,434 --> 00:18:30,555
well, I told her about
the camper,

326
00:18:30,675 --> 00:18:34,286
that she'd have her own bed.
I made it sound like the 4 seasons.

327
00:18:35,274 --> 00:18:38,316
Sean, you're a great dad.

328
00:18:38,436 --> 00:18:42,013
But you don't ask a 13 year old
to go on a trip,

329
00:18:42,133 --> 00:18:43,681
you tell her.

330
00:18:43,749 --> 00:18:45,382
I know. I know.

331
00:18:45,502 --> 00:18:48,085
It's just that I don't see
her very often.

332
00:18:48,153 --> 00:18:51,730
So, yeah. I indulge her more
than I should.

333
00:18:57,306 --> 00:19:01,215
Annie's never gonna respect you
if she knows she can manipulate you.

334
00:19:01,661 --> 00:19:04,026
You know, kids need limits.

335
00:19:04,146 --> 00:19:07,076
Do you want to be
her father or her mark?

336
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,091
Why don't you do this:

337
00:19:09,211 --> 00:19:12,299
How about you and Christian,
you go see Matt's mime thingy.

338
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:13,913
And I will talk to her.

339
00:19:14,033 --> 00:19:15,766
That could backfire.

340
00:19:15,886 --> 00:19:19,209
She hasn't been able to accept you.

341
00:19:19,329 --> 00:19:21,385
I mean, us.

342
00:19:22,555 --> 00:19:25,041
We really should have had some
kind of ceremony.

343
00:19:25,161 --> 00:19:29,063
I could have invited Annie and Connor
and made them a part of it.

344
00:19:31,269 --> 00:19:34,699
You terrible, horrible,
horrible man you.

345
00:19:34,819 --> 00:19:39,670
Thinking of yourself for once.
It'll be ok.

346
00:19:40,883 --> 00:19:43,107
I promise I'll talk to her.

347
00:19:45,353 --> 00:19:47,445
I love you, Mrs. Mcnamara.

348
00:19:47,513 --> 00:19:49,347
Do you know that?

349
00:19:58,074 --> 00:20:00,606
You want to walk back again?
Maybe he was on a break.

350
00:20:00,726 --> 00:20:02,841
You kidding me.
Go past all these freaks again?

351
00:20:02,961 --> 00:20:05,009
The whole place smells
like patchouli.

352
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:08,610
Hey, excuse me.

353
00:20:09,817 --> 00:20:12,427
- You normally work down here?
- Every day, bro.

354
00:20:12,547 --> 00:20:14,443
Is there a section where
we might find a mime?

355
00:20:14,563 --> 00:20:15,387
A mime?

356
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:17,923
A mime, you know, they do
the whole "I'm in a box" thing.

357
00:20:18,043 --> 00:20:19,158
He's got dark hair.
His name is Matt.

358
00:20:19,278 --> 00:20:21,226
Yeah, there's no mimes on
this boardwalk man.

359
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:22,995
At least not anymore.

360
00:20:23,115 --> 00:20:24,322
I mean, there used
to be a bunch, man.

361
00:20:24,442 --> 00:20:26,397
- But now, like--
- Now what?

362
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:28,960
Well, ever since that one started
doing all those Robberies, man,

363
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,083
they all just Sort of like,
disappeared, you know.

364
00:20:31,203 --> 00:20:32,713
What robberies?

365
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:35,810
Some dude dressed as a mime
has been jacking people at gun point.

366
00:20:36,542 --> 00:20:38,563
Happened like 5 times, so

367
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:41,793
the cops started rounding up
all the mime's on the boardwalk

368
00:20:41,913 --> 00:20:43,421
for questioning recently.

369
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,403
Now, they're all gone.

370
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,705
Since when?

371
00:20:47,773 --> 00:20:50,040
A week.
Which is great for me, man,

372
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,793
because more business!

373
00:20:51,913 --> 00:20:53,960
Hey, how much do you make in a day?

374
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,047
On a good weekend like, uh,

375
00:20:56,114 --> 00:20:58,603
I don't know...
Like 40, 50 bucks man, easily.

376
00:20:58,723 --> 00:21:00,051
40, 50 bucks.

377
00:21:00,118 --> 00:21:00,785
Yeah.
That's it?

378
00:21:00,905 --> 00:21:03,064
Dude, that's tax free, man.

379
00:21:05,557 --> 00:21:07,456
How much did Matt give you
for the rent?

380
00:21:07,576 --> 00:21:09,397
Almost 900 bucks.

381
00:21:10,949 --> 00:21:13,808
Annie?
I'd like to talk to you.

382
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,369
Hey, there.
I just wanted

383
00:21:18,437 --> 00:21:21,330
to let you know that I Understand
what you're going through.

384
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,274
You know, feeling betrayed,

385
00:21:23,394 --> 00:21:25,270
self conscious,

386
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:27,194
certain that no one likes you.

387
00:21:27,314 --> 00:21:28,841
I didn't say you could come in.

388
00:21:28,961 --> 00:21:31,922
I wasn't aware that I needed permission
to enter and exit in my own home.

389
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:34,671
- Fine. I'll go back to my mom's.
- Will you?

390
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:40,192
See you're mom is just
as worried about you as we are.

391
00:21:40,312 --> 00:21:41,510
That's why she sent you here.

392
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,619
We all agree that you need help.

393
00:21:43,739 --> 00:21:45,264
you're so full of it.

394
00:21:45,384 --> 00:21:47,017
I don't believe anything you say.

395
00:21:47,137 --> 00:21:49,734
"Distrustful of others."

396
00:21:49,801 --> 00:21:52,900
I forgot that one. I'm going to have
to add it to the list.

397
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:55,200
what list?

398
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,042
The symptoms list on
the admissions form.

399
00:21:59,244 --> 00:22:00,140
Annie,

400
00:22:01,114 --> 00:22:05,697
you're not alone,
there are thousands Of girls just like you.

401
00:22:05,817 --> 00:22:08,120
Hair eaters,
skin cutters,

402
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,388
self starving manic
depressives.

403
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:12,769
They've all managed to get help
at places

404
00:22:12,889 --> 00:22:14,247
like discovery ranch.

405
00:22:14,367 --> 00:22:18,480
No, really. Just google
"mentally disturbed teenage girls"

406
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,779
You'll see.
There are More resident centers

407
00:22:20,899 --> 00:22:22,172
than motel 6s.

408
00:22:22,292 --> 00:22:23,926
We'll find the right one for you.

409
00:22:24,046 --> 00:22:25,136
my dad will never--

410
00:22:25,203 --> 00:22:27,968
You daddy is not always going
to be around to protect you.

411
00:22:28,407 --> 00:22:31,502
And you're not always going to
be daddy's little girl.

412
00:22:32,111 --> 00:22:34,234
Here's a Big secret, Annie:

413
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:38,176
He's a man Just like
every other man.

414
00:22:38,296 --> 00:22:39,627
You can't count on him.

415
00:22:39,747 --> 00:22:42,664
In fact, he's already pretty
fed up with you.

416
00:22:42,784 --> 00:22:46,961
For god's sake he had to pull
a pound of hair out of your stomach.

417
00:22:47,081 --> 00:22:50,528
But it's up to you.

418
00:22:51,987 --> 00:22:52,895
Wait!

419
00:22:55,144 --> 00:22:57,284
What do I have to do?

420
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,044
what do you think?

421
00:23:18,164 --> 00:23:20,238
Any of these bozos look familiar
to you, Mrs. Park?

422
00:23:20,358 --> 00:23:22,313
Hmmm.
I don't know,

423
00:23:22,433 --> 00:23:24,135
they all look the same to me.

424
00:23:24,255 --> 00:23:26,134
Number 5 is 6'5".

425
00:23:26,254 --> 00:23:29,135
You don't remember if the mime
who held you up is 6'5"?

426
00:23:29,255 --> 00:23:31,917
- It happened very fast.
- And he didn't say a word?

427
00:23:32,037 --> 00:23:34,690
All he did was that mime shit.

428
00:23:37,676 --> 00:23:39,997
Ok, gentleman, here's
the drill:

429
00:23:40,117 --> 00:23:43,247
You're each going to step
forward one at a time

430
00:23:43,315 --> 00:23:46,465
pretend your holding a gun to
somebody's face.

431
00:23:46,585 --> 00:23:48,719
Number 1, you're first.

432
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:57,681
No, that's not him.

433
00:23:58,138 --> 00:23:59,713
Your turn number 2.

434
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,214
That look like little Joe on
Bonanza.

435
00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:10,038
Number 3.

436
00:24:19,247 --> 00:24:20,684
All right, all right, all right

437
00:24:20,752 --> 00:24:22,508
guys. Come on.
Let's just keep this simple.

438
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:23,909
Number 4, it's your turn.

439
00:25:04,596 --> 00:25:06,030
No. That's not him either.

440
00:25:06,098 --> 00:25:08,552
And it's not the bald one.
My mime had hair.

441
00:25:08,672 --> 00:25:11,655
- you sure he wasn't wearing a wig?
- No. No. None of these guys are right.

442
00:25:11,775 --> 00:25:14,675
Round up some more mimes
and give me a call.

443
00:25:18,534 --> 00:25:20,959
All right, fellas you can go home.

444
00:26:06,187 --> 00:26:07,393
This is bullshit!

445
00:26:07,513 --> 00:26:10,203
I can't believe you guys
are accusing me of this. I'm your son.

446
00:26:10,323 --> 00:26:13,039
which is why we know this kind of thing
isn't out of character for you!

447
00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:15,467
You've gone from a little shit
to a piece of shit, Matt.

448
00:26:15,587 --> 00:26:17,333
you know what?
I don't need to listen to this.

449
00:26:17,453 --> 00:26:18,223
You sit!

450
00:26:18,925 --> 00:26:21,287
I found this in your bedroom.

451
00:26:22,287 --> 00:26:25,017
You're going through my stuff now?
What is this? Malibu or Moscow?

452
00:26:25,137 --> 00:26:26,073
Where'd you get the money, Matt?

453
00:26:26,193 --> 00:26:28,311
- From miming!
- Bullshit!

454
00:26:28,855 --> 00:26:31,724
You get 20 bucks for walking
against the wind?!

455
00:26:31,844 --> 00:26:34,016
Yeah. Sometimes.
I'm good. I told you.

456
00:26:34,136 --> 00:26:38,463
- Or is that so hard for you to believe?
- We went down to venice and you weren't there.

457
00:26:40,061 --> 00:26:42,108
That's because I moved over
to the promenade.

458
00:26:42,228 --> 00:26:45,004
There are more Europeans there. Where
the hell do you think I get all the 20s from?

459
00:26:45,124 --> 00:26:46,424
It's like 2 bucks to them.

460
00:26:46,492 --> 00:26:49,712
Put yourself in our shoes.
There's over $3,000 here.

461
00:26:49,832 --> 00:26:51,396
From miming?!

462
00:26:58,537 --> 00:27:01,810
You guys really think I did it.

463
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:03,174
My own fathers.

464
00:27:04,645 --> 00:27:07,095
That's--
That's just great. Hold on.

465
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:17,755
"Albert chavies. Detective.
Pacific division."

466
00:27:17,875 --> 00:27:21,626
- What is this?
- He's the cop investigating the mime crimes.

467
00:27:21,746 --> 00:27:23,728
He gave me his card after the
line up yesterday.

468
00:27:23,796 --> 00:27:25,944
- You were in a line up?
- Yeah.

469
00:27:26,064 --> 00:27:28,014
And the eye witness cleared me
as a suspect. 

470
00:27:28,134 --> 00:27:30,013
You can call him if you want to.

471
00:27:30,133 --> 00:27:31,836
Oh, and congratulations by the way.

472
00:27:31,956 --> 00:27:34,666
You both are getting what you wanted:
I'm moving out.

473
00:27:42,615 --> 00:27:46,935
All right, buddy. Here we go.
Now the trick here is to hold it

474
00:27:47,055 --> 00:27:50,145
just far enough away till it
gets a little brown.

475
00:27:50,265 --> 00:27:52,380
But you don't want it
to catch on fire.

476
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,592
The key to the 'smores

477
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,858
is getting the perfect
proportion

478
00:27:56,978 --> 00:28:00,269
between the, uh, chocolate bar

479
00:28:00,389 --> 00:28:02,467
to Graham cracker.

480
00:28:02,535 --> 00:28:04,594
Think that's brown enough?

481
00:28:04,714 --> 00:28:06,738
Me too.
I think we're ready.

482
00:28:06,806 --> 00:28:07,481
Ok.

483
00:28:09,041 --> 00:28:10,909
Ooh.

484
00:28:23,222 --> 00:28:25,569
- Here you go.
- Oh, look at that.

485
00:28:25,689 --> 00:28:27,634
Look how good that looks!
Come here sit down.

486
00:28:29,592 --> 00:28:31,483
I think yours is ready.

487
00:28:31,925 --> 00:28:32,884
Goody!

488
00:28:35,034 --> 00:28:37,762
You know why they call it
a 'smore, don't you?

489
00:28:38,204 --> 00:28:40,909
It's because the 'smore you eat

490
00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:43,408
the 'smore you want.

491
00:28:43,476 --> 00:28:46,197
Maybe they should call 'em
barf bags.

492
00:28:59,992 --> 00:29:01,087
well?

493
00:29:02,046 --> 00:29:04,729
At least it keeps the bugs
away.

494
00:29:04,797 --> 00:29:06,731
All right.
My turn.

495
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:10,519
Ooh, let the professional
handle this one.

496
00:29:12,638 --> 00:29:15,421
Don't shortchange me on the
gooey stuff. Ok?

497
00:29:15,541 --> 00:29:16,574
I won't.

498
00:29:21,147 --> 00:29:22,480
There you go.

499
00:29:22,548 --> 00:29:24,916
Look at that. Look at that.

500
00:29:24,984 --> 00:29:25,825
Nice.

501
00:29:28,053 --> 00:29:29,713
I'm gonna get some water.

502
00:29:29,833 --> 00:29:32,472
can you fill the canteen for
me, please?

503
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:36,594
I think she's
warming up to me.

504
00:29:49,141 --> 00:29:50,548
what are you doing out of bed?

505
00:29:50,668 --> 00:29:52,551
You just had a huge surgery.

506
00:29:52,671 --> 00:29:54,293
Didn't somebody bring you
a bedpan?

507
00:29:54,413 --> 00:29:56,181
she forgets to empty it.

508
00:29:56,248 --> 00:29:58,716
well, that will not do.
I apologize.

509
00:29:59,453 --> 00:30:01,336
Get back into bed.

510
00:30:03,859 --> 00:30:07,060
Could somebody come in here
and clean out ms. Juggs' bedpan, please?

511
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,149
Ms. Juggs is dead.

512
00:30:09,662 --> 00:30:11,963
I have to get
a new stage name.

513
00:30:12,031 --> 00:30:16,436
Jenny Joy.
No need for all that anger.

514
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:20,252
Now, we managed to
take out more than I anticipated.

515
00:30:20,372 --> 00:30:22,295
You down to a "C".

516
00:30:22,415 --> 00:30:24,457
From a "G" to a "C"
if you can believe that.

517
00:30:25,506 --> 00:30:27,479
I'm a little disoriented.

518
00:30:27,546 --> 00:30:31,430
I just feel like something is
missing.

519
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:34,248
uh-huh.
Drainage is looking good.

520
00:30:34,368 --> 00:30:37,570
Linda's gonna show you how
to do that once you get home.

521
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:39,157
I gotta tell ya:

522
00:30:39,225 --> 00:30:41,287
In all the years that
I've done this, I've never seen,

523
00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:42,631
let alone removed,

524
00:30:42,751 --> 00:30:45,488
so much fat and tissue
at one time.

525
00:30:45,608 --> 00:30:47,607
I should have called the
Shelter.

526
00:30:47,727 --> 00:30:50,003
We could have fed the
homeless for weeks.

527
00:30:56,041 --> 00:30:57,375
What?

528
00:30:57,443 --> 00:31:01,127
They look like 2 mosquito
bites.

529
00:31:01,688 --> 00:31:02,869
Sweetheart.

530
00:31:02,989 --> 00:31:06,851
A "c" is a nice handful.
And you know what they say:

531
00:31:06,971 --> 00:31:10,014
Anything more than a handful
is too hard to handle.

532
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:13,139
Don't talk about my breasts
as if they're your playthings.

533
00:31:13,259 --> 00:31:16,128
And don't ever call me
Sweetheart!

534
00:31:16,248 --> 00:31:18,196
Are you in pain? Hmm?

535
00:31:18,316 --> 00:31:19,931
You need to get a handle
on that.

536
00:31:19,999 --> 00:31:23,315
Look, you just grab this little guy here
and you press the button.

537
00:31:23,435 --> 00:31:26,736
Press the button!
Look at you, Mr. Ain't-I-cool.

538
00:31:26,856 --> 00:31:30,256
Feeling like a bigshot
'cause you took away my mojo.

539
00:31:30,376 --> 00:31:34,013
Just cool your jets, all right? I'll get
somebody in here to clean out your bed pan.

540
00:31:34,133 --> 00:31:35,348
No need for that.

541
00:31:38,841 --> 00:31:41,633
can't do this to me.
I'm in recovery.

542
00:31:41,753 --> 00:31:43,269
It's torture!

543
00:31:43,389 --> 00:31:46,205
Don't call amnesty international.
I'm pressing full charges against her.

544
00:31:46,325 --> 00:31:49,542
I'm pressing full charges against you,
you sexually harassing dickweed!

545
00:31:49,662 --> 00:31:52,374
If I ever see you again,
I'll cut off you arms and legs as well!

546
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:56,329
Not before I cut your head off
and shit down your neck!

547
00:31:57,644 --> 00:32:00,435
I guess just because you take
a person's weapons away doesn't

548
00:32:00,555 --> 00:32:02,866
mean you take away their anger.

549
00:33:00,482 --> 00:33:01,456
Hey baby.

550
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:03,698
Hey.

551
00:33:10,717 --> 00:33:12,510
So, the kids are passed out.

552
00:33:13,479 --> 00:33:16,862
I think nature does something
for insomnia.

553
00:33:16,982 --> 00:33:19,600
This was a great idea of yours.

554
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:24,122
One big happy family.

555
00:33:24,951 --> 00:33:28,118
Mm-hmm.
This was a very good idea.

556
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:27,882
So this is where all that
singing's coming from?

557
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:30,065
Scared me.

558
00:35:30,185 --> 00:35:31,092
Sorry.

559
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:33,912
Couldn't sleep
and I heard the opera.

560
00:35:34,032 --> 00:35:38,170
So I figured why not come see
who my cultured neighbor is.

561
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:40,396
Teddy McNamara.

562
00:35:40,781 --> 00:35:41,681
Nice to meet you.

563
00:35:42,608 --> 00:35:46,977
My husband and I are with the
kids over at number 14.

564
00:35:47,097 --> 00:35:48,548
Just up the road.

565
00:35:48,668 --> 00:35:51,778
I'm Jerry.
I'm sorry about the music.

566
00:35:51,898 --> 00:35:54,008
I really thought I was
the only one out here.

567
00:35:54,128 --> 00:35:56,083
Oh, gosh. No worries.
I can't sleep

568
00:35:56,203 --> 00:35:59,170
in those campers anyway.
They're so cramped.

569
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,603
My husband, he's got
the heat up full blast.

570
00:36:01,723 --> 00:36:04,474
Kids are sawing logs.
What about you?

571
00:36:04,594 --> 00:36:07,050
You here with a wife or girlfriend?

572
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:08,813
Me?
No, no. 

573
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:11,091
I can't convince her
to get the waders on.

574
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:12,893
- Fly fisherman?
- Yeah.

575
00:36:13,013 --> 00:36:14,580
Any luck today?

576
00:36:14,648 --> 00:36:19,200
Not much. but I think that's
about to change.

577
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,324
I hope so.

578
00:36:21,444 --> 00:36:24,072
- Would you like some wine?
- Sure.

579
00:36:24,723 --> 00:36:26,635
I have some time.

580
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:33,289
In that case, you're really
going to enjoy the show.

581
00:36:34,435 --> 00:36:36,171
The show?
What show?

582
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:53,786
So where are we going?

583
00:36:54,147 --> 00:36:55,893
Just a few more steps.

584
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,472
Here we are.

585
00:37:05,574 --> 00:37:06,516
Where?

586
00:37:08,701 --> 00:37:11,014
Just wait a second,
it's about to begin.

587
00:37:12,182 --> 00:37:14,614
Dad. Dad.

588
00:37:16,326 --> 00:37:19,208
Connor's sick
and I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

589
00:37:19,328 --> 00:37:20,580
My head...

590
00:37:20,647 --> 00:37:23,998
- You feel it too?
- Can you just open a window?

591
00:37:24,118 --> 00:37:27,026
I tried but
they're all locked.

592
00:37:28,172 --> 00:37:30,256
It's called the perseid
meteor shower

593
00:37:30,376 --> 00:37:32,892
named after the
Perseus constellation.

594
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,760
Oh.

595
00:37:33,827 --> 00:37:35,945
Happens every year
about this time.

596
00:37:36,065 --> 00:37:39,370
But tonight is a very rare event.

597
00:37:43,971 --> 00:37:46,806
Connor, hey.
Come here, Bud.

598
00:37:46,874 --> 00:37:48,975
Come here.
We're gonna get out of here.

599
00:37:49,095 --> 00:37:51,041
It's so transcending.

600
00:37:51,614 --> 00:37:53,980
This is the best part.

601
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,632
You can feel it.

602
00:38:03,019 --> 00:38:05,629
It's like being
one with the cosmos.

603
00:38:06,459 --> 00:38:07,812
Like gods.

604
00:38:14,516 --> 00:38:18,319
Yes. Well, thank you
for bringing me out here.

605
00:38:18,439 --> 00:38:19,942
I need to go.

606
00:38:24,578 --> 00:38:26,946
Ok. Come on. Let's go.

607
00:38:27,014 --> 00:38:28,892
Come on, buddy.

608
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:33,686
Help! Help!

609
00:38:33,754 --> 00:38:36,106
I hate the one's that scream.

610
00:38:42,022 --> 00:38:43,238
Are you ok?

611
00:38:43,897 --> 00:38:45,412
It feels worse.

612
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:48,155
Help! Somebody help!

613
00:38:49,499 --> 00:38:50,629
Sean!

614
00:38:58,038 --> 00:39:00,761
- You ok?
- I don't understand what happened.

615
00:39:00,881 --> 00:39:02,498
keep your brother awake.

616
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,497
Sean!

617
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:34,547
Sean! Sean!

618
00:39:53,216 --> 00:39:56,846
My wife must have taken
the keys when she went for a walk.

619
00:39:56,966 --> 00:40:01,088
I'll get one of my guys to swing by
and find her when she gets back from her walk.

620
00:40:01,208 --> 00:40:04,296
You know you're just lucky
I heard you screaming.

621
00:40:04,416 --> 00:40:06,760
Never get any cell reception out here.

622
00:40:07,808 --> 00:40:11,137
Yeah. Lucky.

623
00:40:30,847 --> 00:40:33,688
You're that mime bandit,
right?

624
00:40:37,311 --> 00:40:41,347
Don't worry. They don't pay me
enough to put up a fight.

625
00:40:44,169 --> 00:40:45,551
It's kinda cool, actually.

626
00:40:45,619 --> 00:40:47,887
Get me on the 6:00 news.

627
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:51,572
Maybe they send one of
those hot ass reporters down

628
00:40:51,692 --> 00:40:53,301
and interview me.

629
00:40:53,762 --> 00:40:56,052
You want silver too?

630
00:41:01,611 --> 00:41:03,248
can you mime dead?

631
00:41:03,368 --> 00:41:04,652
Oh, shit.

632
00:41:11,642 --> 00:41:13,312
Who is it?

633
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,488
Christian?

634
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:24,211
what?
You forget your invisible box?

635
00:41:25,959 --> 00:41:27,226
What?

636
00:41:41,805 --> 00:41:42,884
Help me.

637
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:45,387
Jesus.

638
