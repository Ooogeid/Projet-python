00:00:00,964 --> 00:00:02,314
Previously on <i>"Nip/Tuck"...</i>

2
00:00:02,529 --> 00:00:05,073
Look what I made you. It's a Sean bear!

3
00:00:05,257 --> 00:00:07,372
It's my hobby. I make teddies.

4
00:00:07,586 --> 00:00:09,992
Hi, Sean. We're C.A.A.

5
00:00:10,202 --> 00:00:12,240
- Who?
- Creative Artists Agency.

6
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,627
You will not take away my Sean.

7
00:00:20,643 --> 00:00:24,459
You want more of the truth?
I am going back into porn.

8
00:00:25,685 --> 00:00:28,413
- Where do you belong?
- Maybe with you.

9
00:00:31,352 --> 00:00:34,417
OK. So, this you are going to love.

10
00:00:34,647 --> 00:00:36,927
You know who busted
her tight little tuchas

11
00:00:37,075 --> 00:00:40,378
and got your booked as a judge
on the Miss Teen U.S.A. Pageant?

12
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,849
So, what do you think of that, Dr. Sexy?

13
00:00:43,883 --> 00:00:45,358
And why would my client

14
00:00:45,542 --> 00:00:48,734
be interested in judging a bunch
of double-digit I.Q. adolescents

15
00:00:48,943 --> 00:00:51,135
with bulimia breath
and tacky bathing suits?

16
00:00:51,304 --> 00:00:54,368
Um, because it beats having lunch
with a menopausal agent

17
00:00:54,522 --> 00:00:58,369
with chardonnay breath and
an ill-fitting ensemble from Chico's.

18
00:00:58,518 --> 00:01:01,319
Bliss, Colleen's just looking after
my reputation. There's no need

19
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:03,942
- to attack her personally.
- Sean, don't worry about me.

20
00:01:04,113 --> 00:01:07,299
This mama lion could eat your
little pussycat publicist for brunch,

21
00:01:07,461 --> 00:01:08,871
if she wanted to.

22
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:14,118
Now, I just nabbed a very classy
commercial for you, cookie.

23
00:01:14,378 --> 00:01:16,861
National spokesperson

24
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:21,041
for the new Sizzler's heart savvy
salad bar campaign.

25
00:01:22,551 --> 00:01:24,956
I'm sorry, did you really just suggest

26
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:27,331
to do commercials
for the geriatric community?

27
00:01:27,485 --> 00:01:29,378
Not the kind of thing
I'm looking for either.

28
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,914
Sean, our ten o'clock in my office.

29
00:01:32,154 --> 00:01:36,437
Looks like the star-making machinery
is working a double-shift in here.

30
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:39,495
I need you to do the consult without me.
We got side-tracked.

31
00:01:39,644 --> 00:01:43,011
Yeah, side-tracked by granma's
fantasies of all-you-can-eat-buffets.


32
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:45,629
By the way, Colleen, did you think
about what I asked?

33
00:01:45,797 --> 00:01:48,743
Any new shows looking for
a medical advisor who can act?

34
00:01:48,891 --> 00:01:51,910
Let's we begin with two commissions
instead of just one, huh?

35
00:01:52,452 --> 00:01:57,019
Christian, I like you. So I'm not going
to sell you a line of bullshit.

36
00:01:58,378 --> 00:02:00,783
I took a look at the first episode
of Hearts and Scalpels,"

37
00:02:00,937 --> 00:02:02,791
specifically your outtakes.

38
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:07,400
Acting isn't your thing, honey.

39
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:11,476
I mean, sean, now, has a gift.
He's what we call a natural.

40
00:02:11,978 --> 00:02:14,514
But I just don't have the time
to try and build a career

41
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:17,782
for someone who is untrained and...

42
00:02:18,043 --> 00:02:19,181
untalented.

43
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:21,602
- Colleen.
- Well, it's true.

44
00:02:23,233 --> 00:02:24,475
I'm sorry, honey.

45
00:02:40,137 --> 00:02:42,481
Well, that was nice, Colleen.
That's good work.

46
00:02:42,604 --> 00:02:45,133
You know, just get him a gift
certificate from Burke Williams.

47
00:02:45,268 --> 00:02:46,780
It always makes me feel better.

48
00:02:54,794 --> 00:02:56,525
Lulu Grandiron.

49
00:02:56,771 --> 00:02:59,131
Dr. Christian Troy.
Sorry to keep you waiting.

50
00:03:00,188 --> 00:03:02,702
Your partner's joing us
as well, correct?

51
00:03:03,663 --> 00:03:06,866
Actually, my partner is overwhelmed
with his other career right now. But...

52
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:10,100
the good news is, I'm here,
and you're my only priority.

53
00:03:10,452 --> 00:03:14,858
So, tell me what you don't like
about yourself, Ms. Grandiron.

54
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,501
Call me Lulu, and I'm not here
to be interviewed, Dr. Troy.

55
00:03:18,685 --> 00:03:20,325
I'm here to interview you.

56
00:03:20,862 --> 00:03:23,739
I assume you've heard of
Dr. William Hammerman?

57
00:03:23,892 --> 00:03:26,129
Plastic surgeon,
specializes in society types.

58
00:03:26,252 --> 00:03:28,758
Wouldn't you like to be
on the society page, Dr. Troy?

59
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:31,662
Surgeon to the creme de la creme?

60
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,351
I don't know where you're
getting your information, but

61
00:03:35,474 --> 00:03:37,221
I'm not hurting for business.

62
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:42,493
Darling, I'm not talking about
all those dreary little starlets.

63
00:03:42,733 --> 00:03:45,829
I'm offering you a shot at
the true elite in this town.

64
00:03:45,998 --> 00:03:48,779
We're the ones who put
all those nerdy boys in power,

65
00:03:48,941 --> 00:03:50,959
taught them everything
they know, and then

66
00:03:51,526 --> 00:03:53,656
divorced
them and took all their money.

67
00:03:57,438 --> 00:03:59,599
Back up a second. What do you mean--

68
00:04:00,288 --> 00:04:01,882
offering me a shot?

69
00:04:03,032 --> 00:04:04,794
Hammerman is retiring.

70
00:04:05,173 --> 00:04:08,560
My girlfriends and I need a new
plastic surgeon. We've been...

71
00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:11,134
interviewing candidates, and

72
00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:16,019
we want you to come to a dinner
party so we can get to know you.

73
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,858
Saturday at 9:00.

74
00:04:18,946 --> 00:04:20,065
Black tie.

75
00:04:21,531 --> 00:04:24,213
I'm a plastic surgeon, not a gigolo,

76
00:04:24,443 --> 00:04:27,294
and I'm not looking to
be picked over by a pack

77
00:04:27,508 --> 00:04:29,363
- of bitter divorcees.
- Bitter?

78
00:04:29,757 --> 00:04:31,933
Quite the opposite. We have it all...

79
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,983
experience, no one to answer to,

80
00:04:36,048 --> 00:04:37,665
and all that money.

81
00:04:38,286 --> 00:04:40,814
We'll set a place for you,
just in case you

82
00:04:41,192 --> 00:04:42,587
come to your senses.

Season 5 Episode 12
<i>Lulu Grandiron</i>

87
00:05:47,838 --> 00:05:51,393
There are 7 signs of the
apocalypse, right? Not 2.

88
00:05:52,177 --> 00:05:54,032
You 2 some sort of couple now?

89
00:05:54,292 --> 00:05:55,626
More like a team.

90
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,538
When she and Ram saw
the video I made with Aidan,

91
00:05:58,706 --> 00:06:02,195
- they offered me a deal at Penetrate.
- To do porn. Nice.

92
00:06:02,734 --> 00:06:06,811
Eden is one of the most natural talents
I've seen in a long time...

93
00:06:07,255 --> 00:06:10,765
well, since myself.
And we just had to snatch her up.

94
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,833
You mean, suck her into
that deep hole of whoredom

95
00:06:13,995 --> 00:06:16,447
where you spent
most of your miserable life?

96
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:18,515
We didn't come here for your approval.

97
00:06:18,798 --> 00:06:21,368
- We need your help.
- Well, since you've come to the wizard,

98
00:06:21,537 --> 00:06:25,116
I'm sorry to say that we have
no more brains left. Or hearts.

99
00:06:28,357 --> 00:06:29,858
Jesus. What happened?

100
00:06:31,118 --> 00:06:35,409
I was filming my first sex scene
with Kimber, and she hit me,

101
00:06:36,098 --> 00:06:37,708
but it was brilliant.

102
00:06:43,345 --> 00:06:46,655
We're shooting my new film
"Inside Kimber Henry"...

103
00:06:46,793 --> 00:06:50,575
it's very arty.
It's all about self-exploration.

104
00:06:50,881 --> 00:06:53,303
And since Ram's taken over my career,

105
00:06:53,487 --> 00:06:56,368
he's only allowing me to do sex
scenes with women now.

106
00:07:02,142 --> 00:07:06,234
And this was sort of an homage
to the younger me, when I was a virgin.

107
00:07:22,456 --> 00:07:25,697
The scene called for me to make love
to a younger Kimber

108
00:07:25,828 --> 00:07:30,318
to express my forgiveness of all
of her youthful indiscretions.

109
00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:39,505
Eden was tremendous.

110
00:07:39,652 --> 00:07:41,582
So, we're both climaxing, right?

111
00:07:41,745 --> 00:07:45,178
- Where out of nowhere, she yells...
- Hit me.

112
00:07:47,553 --> 00:07:48,519
Hit me.

113
00:07:50,354 --> 00:07:52,829
I'm a little whore,
and you need to hit me.

114
00:07:56,407 --> 00:07:57,771
I ad libbed a little.

115
00:07:58,338 --> 00:08:00,353
I wanted something memorable
for my first film.

116
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:02,072
And sadomasochism came to mind?

117
00:08:02,195 --> 00:08:05,892
It's the only way to become a star
nowadays. You got to make an impression.

118
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:09,430
- I'm going to take a look.
- What's there to look at, Sean?

119
00:08:09,726 --> 00:08:12,599
I wouldn't fix it. Maybe it will
knock some sense into her.

120
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:15,534
Well, guess what, Christian?
We don't want you to fix it.

121
00:08:16,173 --> 00:08:21,736
Sean's the marquee talent at
Mcnamara/Troy, and stars flock to stars.

122
00:08:23,034 --> 00:08:27,923
Celebrity is a club, and it's one
you haven't been invited to join.

123
00:08:28,138 --> 00:08:31,034
And you know, I feel bad for you,
baby, I really do,

124
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,421
because you never had any real talent,

125
00:08:33,574 --> 00:08:36,057
and your only strength
was your own star power.

126
00:08:36,195 --> 00:08:38,761
And how disappointing it must be
for you to realize

127
00:08:38,908 --> 00:08:41,321
that it's flickering
at such a dim wattage.

128
00:08:44,422 --> 00:08:47,978
You know, I really don't need
to listen to the opinion...

129
00:08:49,038 --> 00:08:52,563
- of whores and porn stars.
- Try businesswoman,

130
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,345
juggling a successful career
and motherhood.

131
00:08:55,575 --> 00:08:58,518
And your granddaughter is doing
fabulous, by the way, grandpy.

132
00:08:58,646 --> 00:09:01,343
It was so cute yesterday.
She said her first word,

133
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:03,212
Ram.

134
00:09:05,573 --> 00:09:07,366
Despite popular opinion,

135
00:09:07,546 --> 00:09:10,887
I actually work with the Hollywood
elite, and I am in great demand.

136
00:09:11,653 --> 00:09:14,772
Sean, you can do what you want.

137
00:09:18,147 --> 00:09:19,840
You fractured your eye socket.

138
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:21,964
It's delicate work.

139
00:09:22,715 --> 00:09:24,370
That's why I came to you.

140
00:09:24,554 --> 00:09:26,147
You have just the right touch.

141
00:09:26,347 --> 00:09:28,056
And I'll pay, of course.

142
00:09:28,429 --> 00:09:30,759
I just feel terrible about this.

143
00:09:30,973 --> 00:09:32,613
So, could you help us, Sean?

144
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,120
How you feeling?

145
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:59,200
Scared, actually.

146
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,357
I always think I'm going to go to sleep,

147
00:10:02,575 --> 00:10:04,430
they'll put me under,
and I'll never wake up.

148
00:10:04,579 --> 00:10:06,027
Oh, not on my watch.

149
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:08,865
When you come out of this,
you're not even going to remember

150
00:10:09,015 --> 00:10:10,489
when you started to drift off.

151
00:10:14,356 --> 00:10:17,290
I used to have a terrible time
falling asleep, for the same reason...

152
00:10:18,288 --> 00:10:20,050
The fear of never waking up.

153
00:10:21,522 --> 00:10:23,805
Maybe I just never knew
what I was waking up for.

154
00:10:24,066 --> 00:10:25,951
Look, when this is over...

155
00:10:26,237 --> 00:10:29,395
maybe it will give you a chance
to sort of rethink things,

156
00:10:30,008 --> 00:10:32,835
- make some better choices.
- Will you help me, Sean?

157
00:10:33,344 --> 00:10:36,654
I keep getting myself involved
in these things that... I don't know.

158
00:10:36,862 --> 00:10:38,808
You're the only one who still
cares about me.

159
00:10:39,046 --> 00:10:41,666
You shouldn't, after
all I've done, but you do.

160
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,092
Don't you?

161
00:10:44,237 --> 00:10:46,076
I care about you getting better.

162
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:55,672
Will you kiss me?

163
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:57,948
Just to calm me down.

164
00:11:07,051 --> 00:11:08,982
After a couple of weeks,
when you've healed,

165
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:10,767
we can talk about what you should do.

166
00:11:10,951 --> 00:11:12,545
Sean, I don't have a couple of weeks.

167
00:11:12,721 --> 00:11:14,537
Ram has me doing
another movie in 6 days.

168
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,846
You're not doing another movie
for that smut-peddler.

169
00:11:16,984 --> 00:11:18,847
- You said you wanted to change.
- I do,

170
00:11:19,016 --> 00:11:21,476
but I don't have a choice.
I signed a contract, Sean.

171
00:11:21,653 --> 00:11:23,576
He owns me. That's why
you have to help me.

172
00:11:24,468 --> 00:11:26,568
I'll fix your face, Eden, but

173
00:11:27,318 --> 00:11:28,713
that's all I can do.

174
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:35,104
OK. Count back from 10 for me.

175
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:52,673
Nice pussy.

176
00:12:02,332 --> 00:12:05,373
Dr. Troy, come meet the ladies.

177
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,929
Marla Middleton.

178
00:12:14,049 --> 00:12:16,355
Newly divorced from my third.

179
00:12:17,474 --> 00:12:18,707
Catherine Wicke.

180
00:12:19,749 --> 00:12:22,057
Still married, but multi-orgasmic.

181
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,321
Annette Wainwright.

182
00:12:25,564 --> 00:12:28,676
My husband died last year
in a skiing accident.

183
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,290
And this is Dr. Kay.

184
00:12:34,698 --> 00:12:35,825
Dr. Cashman.

185
00:12:36,862 --> 00:12:37,862
Hello.

186
00:12:39,923 --> 00:12:41,882
And the Berkowitz twins,

187
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,852
Dr. Joseph and Dr. Michael.

188
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,435
I'm Dr. Michael. Hello.

189
00:12:46,845 --> 00:12:48,930
And I'm Dr. Joseph. Good evening.

190
00:12:54,768 --> 00:12:55,926
Shall we dine?

191
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,294
Yeah you ladies seem very close.

192
00:13:12,454 --> 00:13:13,796
We are.

193
00:13:14,192 --> 00:13:15,425
I mean, I...

194
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:18,676
I've known Annette
since she was an "A" cup.

195
00:13:21,088 --> 00:13:23,436
Last year, when I had
my vagina tightened,

196
00:13:23,777 --> 00:13:26,350
it was my girls here
who pulled me through.

197
00:13:27,761 --> 00:13:30,438
It was that damn haitian pool boy
who did me in.

198
00:13:31,599 --> 00:13:33,816
Jeez. This reminds me
of my last husband.

199
00:13:34,975 --> 00:13:36,819
The one she nicknamed
"Is it in yet?"

200
00:13:38,381 --> 00:13:40,489
I'm sorry. I... I don't get it.

201
00:13:46,989 --> 00:13:48,122
Wait a minute.

202
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,834
Lulu, weren't we supposed to get
that one from the tv show?

203
00:13:52,335 --> 00:13:53,335
Busy.

204
00:13:53,495 --> 00:13:55,656
Well, screw him, then,
for not showing.

205
00:13:55,776 --> 00:13:57,798
You know who needs a show?

206
00:13:58,419 --> 00:13:59,219
Us.

207
00:13:59,594 --> 00:14:00,885
I'll drink to that.

208
00:14:01,721 --> 00:14:03,345
And to Louis Vuitton shoes...

209
00:14:03,725 --> 00:14:04,638
and...

210
00:14:04,798 --> 00:14:05,788
Percocet.

211
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:09,575
I mean, shit. We shop and we screw,
and we screw and we shop.

212
00:14:09,695 --> 00:14:11,187
Who wouldn't watch that show?

213
00:14:11,347 --> 00:14:13,647
- Annette, have you lost weight?
- Down 5.

214
00:14:13,807 --> 00:14:15,983
I haven't had a carb since'87.

215
00:14:17,144 --> 00:14:18,407
Such discipline.

216
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:21,600
Let's get down to business.

217
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,117
Boys, tickle our fancy
with your credentials.

218
00:14:25,636 --> 00:14:26,994
We graduated first...

219
00:14:27,154 --> 00:14:29,288
And second...
In our class at harvard.

220
00:14:29,448 --> 00:14:31,594
But we'll never tell
which of us finished where.

221
00:14:31,714 --> 00:14:32,414
Never.

222
00:14:32,534 --> 00:14:33,501
I went to Brown.

223
00:14:38,784 --> 00:14:39,784
Dr. Troy.

224
00:14:40,501 --> 00:14:41,674
What about you?

225
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:48,684
Well, I've never seen an S.A.T.
score perform a perfect feather lift.

226
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,809
Frankly, I didn't go to
my own graduation.

227
00:14:50,969 --> 00:14:52,144
I was too busy

228
00:14:52,304 --> 00:14:56,273
spraying my population paste all
over the U. Of M. cheerleading squad.

229
00:14:56,798 --> 00:14:59,818
Some resume.
Your parents must be so proud.

230
00:15:04,858 --> 00:15:06,492
You want to see my resume, stretch?

231
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,524
It takes

232
00:15:38,684 --> 00:15:40,978
2 things to make a great surgeon...

233
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,552
Steady hands...

234
00:15:44,338 --> 00:15:45,823
And a monster one of these.

235
00:15:46,097 --> 00:15:48,867
The bigger the cock, the greater the
confidence. The greater the confidence,

236
00:15:49,464 --> 00:15:50,996
the better the surgeon.

237
00:15:51,337 --> 00:15:53,872
This dinner is a pissing contest,
and you ladies have

238
00:15:54,226 --> 00:15:56,125
all the power and all the money.

239
00:15:56,245 --> 00:15:58,586
You've invited us here
tonight to entertain you.

240
00:15:59,203 --> 00:16:01,589
So, I'm cutting straight
to the chase.

241
00:16:12,376 --> 00:16:14,536
Any of you boys think you can...

242
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,228
Trump my ace of clubs?

243
00:16:34,935 --> 00:16:38,563
I wanted your next film to be set
in the 18th Century.

244
00:16:38,683 --> 00:16:41,420
I just think it's going to be
more romantic that way.

245
00:16:41,776 --> 00:16:43,159
What do you think?

246
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:45,883
I'm playing a maid in a whorehouse.

247
00:16:46,223 --> 00:16:48,052
But you're the underdog,

248
00:16:48,212 --> 00:16:50,167
and the audience is going
to root for you.

249
00:16:50,287 --> 00:16:53,289
Besides, you'll become
the house madam in the end.

250
00:16:53,409 --> 00:16:55,267
Yeah, after a bukakke scene

251
00:16:55,427 --> 00:16:57,728
where a dozen men stand
around me and spooge in my face.

252
00:16:58,178 --> 00:16:59,407
That's gross. Forget it.

253
00:16:59,527 --> 00:17:00,851
I'm not doing this.

254
00:17:01,475 --> 00:17:03,391
Show a little goddamn gratitude.

255
00:17:03,972 --> 00:17:05,861
I worked all night on this.

256
00:17:06,323 --> 00:17:07,286
Eden.

257
00:17:08,037 --> 00:17:09,037
Sweetie.

258
00:17:11,379 --> 00:17:14,703
Kimber and I have both been around this
business a lot longer than you have,

259
00:17:15,563 --> 00:17:16,955
and frankly, sweetheart,

260
00:17:17,115 --> 00:17:18,536
you need to pay your dues.

261
00:17:19,517 --> 00:17:21,543
I paid my dues already,

262
00:17:21,703 --> 00:17:24,837
and I won't be degraded like that again,
not if you want me to be the star.

263
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:25,881
Star?

264
00:17:26,972 --> 00:17:30,972
Darling, you're not even a wet spot
in the porn industry.

265
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,222
I'm the star.

266
00:17:33,382 --> 00:17:35,813
I've done over 50 films.

267
00:17:36,677 --> 00:17:39,295
And if you want even half
of what I have,

268
00:17:39,415 --> 00:17:41,397
you're going to have
to show me some respect.

269
00:17:46,439 --> 00:17:48,001
You know what I think?

270
00:17:49,254 --> 00:17:50,478
First of all...

271
00:17:51,004 --> 00:17:53,409
You need to be a little more diligent
with the moisturizer.

272
00:17:53,925 --> 00:17:55,160
And secondly,

273
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,121
you want what I've got,

274
00:17:57,281 --> 00:18:00,082
but you'll never be
18 again, now, will you?

275
00:18:01,577 --> 00:18:03,089
I may be new at this,

276
00:18:03,464 --> 00:18:07,423
but even I know that it's youth
that sells porn, not nostalgia.

277
00:18:15,132 --> 00:18:16,348
I'll look at the script.

278
00:18:19,261 --> 00:18:22,488
Unless you're family, we don't allow
visitors so soon after surgery.

279
00:18:22,608 --> 00:18:23,735
Leave, now.

280
00:18:24,516 --> 00:18:25,532
Sean.

281
00:18:26,709 --> 00:18:28,412
We were discussing business.

282
00:18:28,604 --> 00:18:30,612
Dr. McNamara. Ram peters.

283
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:38,495
Doctor, you did a fantastic job
on my little girl here.

284
00:18:39,754 --> 00:18:42,079
When do you think
she'll be camera-ready?

285
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,047
Let's discuss that in private.

286
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:08,203
Don't you ever cross me again,

287
00:19:08,987 --> 00:19:11,820
baby girl. You'll regret it.

288
00:19:17,972 --> 00:19:21,903
What I want to know from you is what
would you need to break her contract?

289
00:19:24,677 --> 00:19:28,207
I don't break contracts, doctor,
not with any of my girls... ever.

290
00:19:28,722 --> 00:19:29,722
How much?

291
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:40,098
Why, Dr. McNamara.

292
00:19:41,164 --> 00:19:42,164
You cad.

293
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:44,432
10,000? 20?

294
00:19:48,144 --> 00:19:49,817
I tell you what... I got a better idea.

295
00:19:52,135 --> 00:19:55,571
I have a large stable of women
over 50 under contract as well.

296
00:19:55,691 --> 00:19:58,700
They're not the top talent at penetrate,
but they bring in the most returns.

297
00:19:59,012 --> 00:20:00,045
Eddie, boy!

298
00:20:00,696 --> 00:20:03,205
Guys like to see old gals
pounded hard.

299
00:20:03,474 --> 00:20:05,707
Guilt titles sell like wildfire.

300
00:20:06,507 --> 00:20:09,711
Because of their age, I pay them a tenth
of what a 20-year-old would make.

301
00:20:09,871 --> 00:20:12,218
I can work them twice as hard.
They love it.

302
00:20:12,869 --> 00:20:16,110
I'm finding there's a solid niche market
for older women,

303
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:19,221
but it's hard to find ones that
keep themselves in shape at that age

304
00:20:19,381 --> 00:20:21,225
and are still willing to do films.

305
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:25,010
So, you help me trim the fat,
so to speak,

306
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:27,546
get a couple of
my older girls in shape,

307
00:20:28,497 --> 00:20:29,882
Eden's free to go.

308
00:20:31,007 --> 00:20:31,840
Fine.

309
00:20:32,318 --> 00:20:35,237
4 grannies... implants, lipo.
That's it.

310
00:20:36,052 --> 00:20:36,874
Deal?

311
00:20:45,089 --> 00:20:46,804
I sure hope she's worth it.

312
00:20:50,717 --> 00:20:52,588
Tell me what you don't like
about yourself.

313
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:02,014
I think you're perfect.

314
00:21:02,174 --> 00:21:03,065
Thank you.

315
00:21:03,185 --> 00:21:05,601
You could use some microlipo
on your thighs.

316
00:21:13,101 --> 00:21:15,120
Maybe... maybe an ass implant.

317
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,435
Sock it to me, doc.

318
00:21:16,646 --> 00:21:17,994
Sock it to me, doc, to me.

319
00:21:26,392 --> 00:21:28,728
You have the tits of a 30-year-old.

320
00:21:30,177 --> 00:21:32,983
Maybe you could go up to a double "D,"

321
00:21:33,896 --> 00:21:36,037
give you that firmness back.

322
00:21:36,157 --> 00:21:37,941
That was the breast-feeding.

323
00:21:40,535 --> 00:21:42,484
Want to nurse me, pretty boy?

324
00:21:55,778 --> 00:21:58,455
You need an eye job and a neck lift.

325
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,216
Maybe some botox.

326
00:22:05,055 --> 00:22:06,224
Is that all?

327
00:22:07,036 --> 00:22:08,433
You want more?

328
00:22:17,777 --> 00:22:20,595
I didn't become plastic surgeon
to the richest woman in L.A.

329
00:22:20,715 --> 00:22:23,645
to be stuck on an assembly line
of middle-aged tits and ass.

330
00:22:23,765 --> 00:22:26,633
You're supposed to hook me up,
give me the keys to the kingdom.

331
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,314
What an idiot.

332
00:22:29,455 --> 00:22:31,847
Jesus. If any celebrity
gives a shit about

333
00:22:31,967 --> 00:22:34,137
where the first wives' club
get their faces done--

334
00:22:34,283 --> 00:22:36,826
you an pack will have
to find somebody call.

335
00:22:36,966 --> 00:22:40,019
I completely understand.

336
00:22:40,391 --> 00:22:42,440
There's certainly nothing
glamorous about

337
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,531
an assembly line
of middle aged tits and ass.

338
00:22:45,669 --> 00:22:47,450
What you need

339
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:50,364
is a surgery that will set you apart,

340
00:22:50,523 --> 00:22:54,201
give you the attention you deserve
as a doctor,

341
00:22:54,371 --> 00:22:56,470
and as an artist.

342
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:59,170
It's a good start.

343
00:23:00,014 --> 00:23:02,862
I've had a chance to watch
your work, Dr. Troy,

344
00:23:03,047 --> 00:23:04,559
but I've seen the results.

345
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:07,733
You're really no different
than a sculptor,

346
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:12,176
chiseling away at the human form,
manipulating tissue and bone.

347
00:23:12,296 --> 00:23:15,746
Please, don't ever denigrate yourself.

348
00:23:15,866 --> 00:23:18,150
You're not just a plastic surgeon.

349
00:23:18,673 --> 00:23:22,107
You're a modern day Michelangelo.

350
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:26,056
I wouldn't go that far. Rodin, maybe.

351
00:23:27,664 --> 00:23:31,203
- I'm glad that you understand.
- Of course I do.

352
00:23:31,574 --> 00:23:34,532
That's why I saved myself for last.

353
00:23:34,652 --> 00:23:40,165
I am the canvas upon which
you can truly express yourself.

354
00:23:40,305 --> 00:23:43,926
And how exactly
would you like to be expressed?

355
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:49,527
I want my face to reflect
the duality of my nature, my...

356
00:23:49,879 --> 00:23:53,441
Sensuous animal spirit. The...

357
00:23:54,028 --> 00:23:57,579
Sacred feline essence within.

358
00:23:59,419 --> 00:24:02,946
You want a softer, more sensual look?

359
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:07,739
Did you know that the egyptians

360
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:12,450
believed that the cat was endowed
with the light of human consciousness?

361
00:24:12,673 --> 00:24:16,868
They believe that the souls who had died
entered into the cat,

362
00:24:17,337 --> 00:24:20,911
giving it its powerful radiance.
I want you...

363
00:24:22,036 --> 00:24:25,107
to bring me closer to that radiance.

364
00:24:25,796 --> 00:24:27,613
You want me to make you look like a cat.

365
00:24:27,812 --> 00:24:30,109
Don't be ridiculous.

366
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:31,984
I'm not insane.

367
00:24:32,712 --> 00:24:36,638
That's a relief. Whiskers and tails
are really not my specialty.

368
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,392
Well, maybe I was wrong about you.

369
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:42,568
I thought, as an artist,

370
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:44,814
you might be able to find a way to

371
00:24:45,007 --> 00:24:48,394
accentuate my more feline
characteristics,

372
00:24:48,603 --> 00:24:53,196
to suggest its form within mine.

373
00:24:57,837 --> 00:24:59,642
Why on earth do you want this done?

374
00:25:01,646 --> 00:25:04,493
If I can no longer be young,

375
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:08,712
I want my face to reflect
all the wisdom and power in me.

376
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,720
We're extraordinary people
living ordinary lives, you and I,

377
00:25:12,931 --> 00:25:17,478
because no one sees us,
no one really knows who we are.

378
00:25:17,831 --> 00:25:21,839
You're an artist, not a mechanic.

379
00:25:23,538 --> 00:25:26,772
I'm offering you a chance to prove it.

380
00:25:45,206 --> 00:25:46,589
How are you feeling?

381
00:25:47,386 --> 00:25:50,714
If I say I feel like crap,
will you let me stay here longer?

382
00:25:50,913 --> 00:25:54,956
- I can't do another porn, Sean.
- You don't have to.

383
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:59,152
This is your contract with penetrate.

384
00:25:59,468 --> 00:26:01,519
Tear it up.

385
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,877
- Did you steal this?
- No.

386
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:13,001
I just talked to Ram, and he feels
the same way about you I do...

387
00:26:13,121 --> 00:26:16,319
that you don't belong in that business.

388
00:26:17,878 --> 00:26:19,463
Sean!

389
00:26:20,538 --> 00:26:23,292
Is this your way of saying
you love me like I love you?

390
00:26:24,426 --> 00:26:27,778
It doesn't matter how I feel.
This can't happen.

391
00:26:28,001 --> 00:26:30,473
No one would allow it.

392
00:26:31,481 --> 00:26:32,946
You're 18.

393
00:26:33,098 --> 00:26:35,805
I'm old enough to be your father.

394
00:26:36,985 --> 00:26:38,918
Our families would hate us,

395
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:41,825
and business would take a dive.
We'd be pariahs.

396
00:26:41,989 --> 00:26:46,594
I don't give a shit about any of that.
I don't. I don't care.

397
00:28:03,335 --> 00:28:06,019
- What are you doing?
- Making my client happy.

398
00:28:06,187 --> 00:28:07,769
By turning her into Garfield?

399
00:28:08,132 --> 00:28:09,421
I'm bringing out her true self.

400
00:28:09,737 --> 00:28:13,018
Nose jobs, tit jobs, tummy tucks... they
are all the work of a simple craftsman,

401
00:28:13,171 --> 00:28:15,397
which is why Sean is so good at them.

402
00:28:15,561 --> 00:28:18,573
What I am doing to this woman is art.

403
00:28:19,141 --> 00:28:20,653
What you're doing is barbaric.

404
00:28:20,895 --> 00:28:22,229
By the time you're done with her,

405
00:28:22,349 --> 00:28:24,996
she's going to look like the side
of a Hello Kitty lunchbox.

406
00:28:25,305 --> 00:28:27,114
Why is wanting to look like
a glamorous puma

407
00:28:27,234 --> 00:28:28,774
any more strange
than wanting to look like

408
00:28:28,956 --> 00:28:31,044
Pamela Anderson or Angelina Jolie?

409
00:28:31,164 --> 00:28:34,277
- It's all idolatry, Liz.
- This surgery is nuts.

410
00:28:34,397 --> 00:28:35,958
- I'm out.
- Great.

411
00:28:36,078 --> 00:28:39,253
Go roll your eyes at the goddamn
golf course for all I care.

412
00:28:40,294 --> 00:28:43,146
Look, stop panicking, Liz. She's not
going to look exactly like a cat.

413
00:28:43,266 --> 00:28:45,391
She's just going to have
a feline essence.

414
00:28:46,171 --> 00:28:48,572
Where did you get that line,
out of her litter box?

415
00:28:48,692 --> 00:28:51,315
- Don't mock what you don't understand.
- Oh, I understand this.

416
00:28:51,435 --> 00:28:53,043
There is going to be
a storm of shit around this,

417
00:28:53,163 --> 00:28:56,390
and I'll tell you right now, I am not
going to get caught in the rain.

418
00:29:05,484 --> 00:29:07,336
You a dog person, too?

419
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:12,715
Where are you, Chaz? Pick up.

420
00:29:12,962 --> 00:29:15,427
Look, I need you to bring me some
new magazines, my makeup,

421
00:29:15,547 --> 00:29:19,501
and some good coke.
Call me back, OK?

422
00:29:26,242 --> 00:29:29,711
- Hello, Eden.
- Jesus. You scared me.

423
00:29:29,996 --> 00:29:31,145
Sorry.

424
00:29:32,306 --> 00:29:33,377
Do I know you?

425
00:29:33,497 --> 00:29:36,888
Well, not technically, but we're kind
of in the same family.

426
00:29:37,104 --> 00:29:40,058
I'm Colleen Rose, Sean's agent.

427
00:29:40,878 --> 00:29:42,624
Where's Sean?

428
00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:44,705
Brought you a present.

429
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:48,855
I thought you could use a special
love-yourself Eden bear.

430
00:29:49,089 --> 00:29:52,441
Maybe a sympathetic ear.
I make these for people.

431
00:29:52,722 --> 00:29:53,742
Listen.

432
00:29:54,116 --> 00:29:57,456
<i>I love you.
I love you. I love you.</i>

433
00:29:57,843 --> 00:30:01,675
OK, that's creepy, and so are you.

434
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:02,906
Look.

435
00:30:03,081 --> 00:30:06,011
I don't need you to
make me feel better. What I need

436
00:30:06,281 --> 00:30:08,062
are some more painkillers.

437
00:30:14,308 --> 00:30:16,616
I was like you, you know.

438
00:30:17,484 --> 00:30:19,593
Had all the boys eating out of my hand,

439
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,902
and the only one that I wanted

440
00:30:22,171 --> 00:30:25,851
- was the one I couldn't have.
- Excuse me?

441
00:30:27,351 --> 00:30:32,144
When you're a mama lion,
and you see a baby cub in distress,

442
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,746
you instinctively move to help.

443
00:30:36,773 --> 00:30:38,930
You need to be told the truth.

444
00:30:40,137 --> 00:30:41,672
And what might that be?

445
00:30:44,038 --> 00:30:46,627
Sean doesn't love you.

446
00:30:47,131 --> 00:30:48,596
And he never will.

447
00:30:50,002 --> 00:30:51,549
And you know all this because?

448
00:30:51,936 --> 00:30:54,608
Because there's nothing
he doesn't tell me.

449
00:30:55,604 --> 00:31:00,456
The males of our species are just silly,
selfish, preening fools,

450
00:31:00,782 --> 00:31:03,419
which you will come to understand.

451
00:31:05,256 --> 00:31:06,896
My gosh.

452
00:31:08,959 --> 00:31:11,947
You're totally in love with Sean.

453
00:31:13,589 --> 00:31:17,222
You're a desperate old bag who has
a pathetic crush on her client.

454
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,628
What a cliche.

455
00:31:18,792 --> 00:31:22,636
Please. The whole world is in love
with Sean. That's not the point.

456
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:24,657
What is the point, Colleen?

457
00:31:24,892 --> 00:31:28,302
I heard Sean and Aidan talking about
how they like to pass you around

458
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:32,169
and how you're quickly becoming
the town pump.

459
00:31:32,439 --> 00:31:34,958
And they said it
in front of a lot of crewmen.

460
00:31:35,419 --> 00:31:37,365
It was disgusting,

461
00:31:37,743 --> 00:31:41,146
especially one grip who said,
"i'd like a piece of that whore."

462
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:42,806
And Sean and Aidan laughed

463
00:31:43,052 --> 00:31:45,982
and said, "we can make that happen.
She'll screw anybody."

464
00:31:55,357 --> 00:31:57,607
He's using you, honey,

465
00:31:57,771 --> 00:32:00,829
all right? So he can feel young
and viable. That's all.

466
00:32:01,861 --> 00:32:03,841
He said he had feelings for me.

467
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,333
Yeah, feelings for your
sweet sugar tits, maybe.

468
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:09,501
Not for you.

469
00:32:10,005 --> 00:32:13,181
Look, I went to your defense.
I said, "she's just a baby."

470
00:32:13,497 --> 00:32:16,146
And they should start looking
at women their own age.

471
00:32:17,095 --> 00:32:20,271
But that's our sick society for you.

472
00:32:22,509 --> 00:32:23,646
You're a liar.

473
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:28,872
You look at me, honey...

474
00:32:30,337 --> 00:32:33,079
And tell me you really think i'm lying.

475
00:32:39,865 --> 00:32:43,439
Hey, you. How's your tv show going?

476
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:46,064
Since when do you want
to hear about the show?

477
00:32:46,615 --> 00:32:48,302
Despite what you might think, sean,

478
00:32:48,443 --> 00:32:51,173
I don't need for you to fail
in order for me to be happy.

479
00:32:51,724 --> 00:32:54,618
I wish you many years of
success on your little tv show.

480
00:32:54,894 --> 00:32:57,297
Spoken with incredible condescension.

481
00:32:57,572 --> 00:33:00,703
Not at all.
I have a great respect for the media.

482
00:33:00,823 --> 00:33:02,974
It's not fine art,
but it doesn't pretend to be,

483
00:33:03,094 --> 00:33:05,630
and if it's an outlet for
your creative energies...

484
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:07,637
You're doing that smug thing again.

485
00:33:07,757 --> 00:33:11,511
Whenever something nice happens to you,
you become the cat that ate the canary

486
00:33:11,634 --> 00:33:14,646
so you can bask in your 5 minutes
of superiority as long as possible.

487
00:33:15,806 --> 00:33:17,902
I'm not basking in anything.

488
00:33:18,022 --> 00:33:22,872
I'm just feeling newly inspired.
I'm looking at my job in a new light,

489
00:33:23,184 --> 00:33:26,945
like a form
of self-expression, true art.

490
00:33:27,065 --> 00:33:29,234
It's like I'm Michelangelo...

491
00:33:29,386 --> 00:33:30,535
With a 10 blade.

492
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,175
Hello?

493
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:42,176
Sean? Bliss. You have to meet me
at Hollywood and Highland.

494
00:33:42,296 --> 00:33:45,811
Why? Is there a sale?
Bliss, it's the middle of the day.

495
00:33:45,931 --> 00:33:47,982
<i>Look, I don't give a shit</i>
what time it is, OK?

496
00:33:48,102 --> 00:33:51,482
This is an emergency. Your career
and your reputation depend on it.

497
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,146
All right. I have to go.

498
00:34:00,874 --> 00:34:03,991
Bliss is having a meltdown or something.

499
00:34:05,268 --> 00:34:09,733
Listen, Michelangelo, I'm glad you're
feeling inspired, but just rember...

500
00:34:09,917 --> 00:34:12,201
The difference between
a plastic surgeon and a sculptor

501
00:34:12,321 --> 00:34:14,910
is the marble doesn't sue if
you screw it up.

502
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:24,340
There we go.
Yummy-yum.

503
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:26,532
All right.

504
00:34:27,223 --> 00:34:29,469
- Oh, now, you don't need that...
- Ladies.

505
00:34:29,589 --> 00:34:30,394
Oh! How is she?

506
00:34:30,938 --> 00:34:33,100
She can't even talk
under all those bandages.

507
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:35,842
I mean, we talk and we talk,
and she just nods.

508
00:34:35,962 --> 00:34:37,308
It's like dinner with my husband.

509
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,195
I think you're going
to like what you see.

510
00:34:54,452 --> 00:34:55,296
Lulu!

511
00:35:09,406 --> 00:35:11,093
Jesus Christ!

512
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,073
- What did you do to her?
- Oh! You're jealous.

513
00:35:18,506 --> 00:35:20,745
Let me see.
Let me see.

514
00:35:26,569 --> 00:35:30,600
Oh, I love it. Oh, I worship it.

515
00:35:36,049 --> 00:35:38,463
I'm a hot little pussy now.

516
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:40,678
Shit. She's off her meds.

517
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,983
- Meds?
- She's bi-polar.

518
00:35:44,534 --> 00:35:47,440
Jesus, a woman asks you
to turn her into frisky,

519
00:35:47,686 --> 00:35:50,749
and you don't suspect there's something
seriously wrong with her?

520
00:35:50,869 --> 00:35:54,002
Your problem is you have
too much dick and not enough brains.

521
00:35:54,253 --> 00:35:55,648
I can fix this.

522
00:35:56,269 --> 00:35:58,992
Yeah, well, you better, or you're going
to be giving nose jobs

523
00:35:59,112 --> 00:36:00,910
to homeless women on Shitter's Alley.

524
00:36:01,414 --> 00:36:03,444
Come on, girls. We're out of here.

525
00:36:03,564 --> 00:36:04,541
Ought to be shot.

526
00:36:07,834 --> 00:36:08,971
Come on.

527
00:36:16,893 --> 00:36:18,549
Hollywood and Highland?

528
00:36:18,669 --> 00:36:21,836
"A," what could you possibly be doing
out here? And "B," I don't believe you.

529
00:36:21,956 --> 00:36:25,436
OK. The chanel makeup was 75 off,
and I love a good sale. So sue me.

530
00:36:26,068 --> 00:36:30,100
Now, I know this seems shocking
and terrible, but I can spin it...

531
00:36:30,346 --> 00:36:35,045
it is so good. Like, "vanity fair" good.

532
00:36:35,232 --> 00:36:38,217
"Posing as a power player
among hollywood's elite,

533
00:36:38,337 --> 00:36:40,899
she was desperately hiding
a secret life of

534
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:44,914
talking bears and interactions
with hideous valley toddlers."

535
00:36:59,562 --> 00:37:02,270
Would you excuse me a minute, please?

536
00:37:03,934 --> 00:37:06,840
Colleen, what's going on?
Why are you here?

537
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:11,183
It's my niece's kiosk, and i'm just
filling in 'cause she was sick.

538
00:37:11,303 --> 00:37:14,788
- Why? Is that wrong?
- And the lies just keep on coming.

539
00:37:15,017 --> 00:37:18,626
This isn't your second job, Colleen...
it's your only job.

540
00:37:18,767 --> 00:37:21,802
I checked with mall security.
You're here, on average, 8 hours a day.

541
00:37:21,995 --> 00:37:24,913
Why don't you just butt out,
you stupid little barbie doll?

542
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:27,694
Oh, I knew there was something
wrong with you. I just knew it!

543
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:30,707
You're just a sad little nobody
with a good scam.

544
00:37:31,024 --> 00:37:34,504
Yeah, well, who the hell are you
to criticize me for having 2 jobs?

545
00:37:34,955 --> 00:37:36,549
What, did you ever lack for attention?

546
00:37:36,772 --> 00:37:40,166
OK, just spare us the
"sturm und drang", honey, OK?

547
00:37:40,286 --> 00:37:44,595
I checked the entire database of
licensed agents, and you're not anywhere

548
00:37:44,755 --> 00:37:47,392
You never were as far back as'85.

549
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,618
You lied about who you are.
That's unforgivable.

550
00:37:50,738 --> 00:37:53,145
I don't care how hard you worked.
I trusted you.

551
00:37:53,573 --> 00:37:56,384
Does that mean the fact that I got you
the lead in "hearts and scalpels"

552
00:37:56,504 --> 00:37:59,515
means nothing to you? Why, because
I don't have the right piece of paper?

553
00:37:59,948 --> 00:38:01,566
Do you even have any other clients?

554
00:38:03,991 --> 00:38:06,030
Do you have any other clients?

555
00:38:07,226 --> 00:38:08,503
You're scaring me.

556
00:38:09,441 --> 00:38:11,971
I won't have you talk to me this way

557
00:38:12,091 --> 00:38:13,955
when I treated you with respect.

558
00:38:17,366 --> 00:38:19,205
I deserve respect, too.

559
00:38:20,295 --> 00:38:22,241
Colleen, I want you
to leave me alone now.

560
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:24,034
No calls, no visits, nothing.

561
00:38:24,506 --> 00:38:27,553
This is the end of our relationship.
Do you understand?

562
00:38:30,635 --> 00:38:33,014
How did you even get on the lot,
anyway? The tour?

563
00:38:35,947 --> 00:38:37,401
Why? Why me?

564
00:38:37,717 --> 00:38:41,654
Don't even ask, Sean, OK?
She's clearly demented.

565
00:38:42,848 --> 00:38:44,395
Come on.

566
00:39:08,954 --> 00:39:12,482
You know I don't like it
when you do that, mama.

567
00:39:12,903 --> 00:39:16,267
Don't start with me
about what you don't like,

568
00:39:16,571 --> 00:39:20,321
not unless you want me
to start complaing.

569
00:39:23,931 --> 00:39:25,735
You know...

570
00:39:27,409 --> 00:39:29,940
I think you're the cat's pajamas.

571
00:39:30,257 --> 00:39:32,600
But this is business.

572
00:39:34,217 --> 00:39:38,411
That's why I love you so much.
You're a hot, sexy woman who

573
00:39:38,973 --> 00:39:42,782
also understands
the business side of my life...

574
00:39:43,661 --> 00:39:45,559
The rewards...

575
00:39:46,766 --> 00:39:48,313
Pressures.

576
00:39:50,766 --> 00:39:52,289
I get it.

577
00:39:53,649 --> 00:39:55,301
Just don't have to like it.

578
00:40:16,687 --> 00:40:18,269
- Hi.
- Hi.

579
00:40:20,153 --> 00:40:23,493
- How's my baby doing?
- Good.

580
00:40:26,244 --> 00:40:29,045
Welcome to the family.

581
00:40:57,806 --> 00:41:00,208
Go ahead. Say it.
I know you want to.

582
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:06,587
Fine. I'm an idiot, OK?

583
00:41:06,707 --> 00:41:07,764
- And?
- And what?

584
00:41:07,884 --> 00:41:09,659
You want me to get on my knees?
I'm sorry.

585
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:12,583
And just so we don't get sued,
the next time someone comes in here

586
00:41:12,703 --> 00:41:15,275
with an outrageous request, you'll
double-check their background first.

587
00:41:15,395 --> 00:41:17,693
- Like you researched Colleen?
- That's different.

588
00:41:17,813 --> 00:41:20,171
How? She came into your office,
blew smoke up your ass,

589
00:41:20,291 --> 00:41:23,589
and you handed her your career,
no questions asked.

590
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,018
You're right.

591
00:41:28,342 --> 00:41:30,983
Damn, it felt good, though,
getting my ego stroked like that.

592
00:41:31,103 --> 00:41:33,491
It's a mental blowjob. You can sit back,
relax, let them do the work

593
00:41:33,611 --> 00:41:35,350
- while you get off.
- It's addicting, though.

594
00:41:35,682 --> 00:41:37,096
I feel like I'm in withdrawal.

595
00:41:37,216 --> 00:41:40,116
You got worse problems than that,
my friend. You think you're an actor.

596
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,801
What are you doing here, Colleen?

597
00:43:34,488 --> 00:43:36,750
What have you done?

598
00:43:37,078 --> 00:43:38,941
I'm calling 911.

599
00:43:41,332 --> 00:43:43,577
I think that's a good idea.

600
00:43:52,793 --> 00:43:55,255
