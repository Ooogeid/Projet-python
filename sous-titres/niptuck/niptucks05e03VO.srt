00:00:00,967 --> 00:00:02,563
<i>Previously on</i> Nip/Tuck...

2
00:00:02,714 --> 00:00:05,033
My dad just gave us

3
00:00:05,286 --> 00:00:07,699
a lot of money for
the baby's education fund.

4
00:00:08,412 --> 00:00:10,818
Her name is Kate. She happens to be
pretty special.

5
00:00:10,968 --> 00:00:12,771
I had gastric bypass and...

6
00:00:13,005 --> 00:00:14,709
I lost 100 pounds, this is the result.

7
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,530
I don't give a shit
if she was once fat.

8
00:00:16,643 --> 00:00:19,272
Julia met someone. You met someone.

9
00:00:20,426 --> 00:00:23,694
Ollie. Sounds very upper crust.
Is Ollie rich?

10
00:00:23,947 --> 00:00:25,442
Yes, very.

11
00:00:26,709 --> 00:00:27,733
And it's Olivia.

12
00:00:39,464 --> 00:00:40,638
No.

13
00:00:40,812 --> 00:00:43,210
Come on. Let them out.
They'll suffocate.

14
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,982
Trust me. I'm a famous TV surgeon.

15
00:00:45,097 --> 00:00:47,117
Right, which is exactly
why you should be careful

16
00:00:47,217 --> 00:00:49,212
because the tabloids
would kill for a photo op.

17
00:00:49,312 --> 00:00:51,117
Of us naked in the hot tub?

18
00:00:55,132 --> 00:00:56,906
- Sean, I got to go.
- Oh, no, you don't.

19
00:00:57,595 --> 00:00:59,147
- No, I do. I got a cramp.
- OK, OK.

20
00:00:59,867 --> 00:01:02,274
I promise we don't have to get naked.

21
00:01:02,817 --> 00:01:05,039
Wait, Sean. Oh, God.

22
00:01:19,957 --> 00:01:22,670
I, uh, I drained it.

23
00:01:23,329 --> 00:01:26,746
I put enough disinfectant in there
to kill an outbreak of Ebola, so

24
00:01:46,597 --> 00:01:47,454
Honey, come on.

25
00:01:47,592 --> 00:01:49,907
Don't. Don't touch me.
I can't even look at you.

26
00:01:50,268 --> 00:01:51,486
I'm a doctor.

27
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:53,259
Besides, this was nothing.

28
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:56,036
- Once you've seen your children born--
- Wait, wait. Hey, whoa.

29
00:01:56,297 --> 00:01:59,530
Are you comparing the birth of your
children to me shitting in a hot tub?

30
00:02:00,109 --> 00:02:03,389
Maybe you've got a bug or a stomach flu.
Did you eat something--

31
00:02:03,534 --> 00:02:05,641
Yeah, yeah. I did. I ate something, OK?

32
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:10,870
I felt awful after doing
the scene with Aidan, and

33
00:02:12,249 --> 00:02:15,616
I tried shoving the entire
catering truck down my throat.

34
00:02:15,753 --> 00:02:17,475
When that didn't
make me feel any better,

35
00:02:17,602 --> 00:02:20,956
I went over to the craft service table,
and I hoovered up all the sugar cookies.

36
00:02:24,563 --> 00:02:26,969
At least when you do a play, you can
go to the ladies' room

37
00:02:27,086 --> 00:02:30,587
and vomit between acts, but, no, this is
TV. The next shot was close on my face,

38
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,433
so I had to resort to plan "B."

39
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,065
|- You took a laxative?
- Yeah, 3.

40
00:02:38,282 --> 00:02:40,919
You're never going to be able
to have sex with me again, are you?

41
00:02:41,037 --> 00:02:43,137
Oh, for God's sake,

42
00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:47,321
I mean, I am a little concerned
that you'd resort to pills.

43
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,543
It was a catch-22, OK?

44
00:02:52,826 --> 00:02:55,216
I'm so dissatisfied

45
00:02:55,921 --> 00:02:58,389
with everything-- work, my body--

46
00:03:00,488 --> 00:03:01,975
So I eat.

47
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,981
I'm just scared.
I'm scared that I'm not gonna

48
00:03:06,717 --> 00:03:08,819
that I'm not gonna be satisfied
till I drive away

49
00:03:08,942 --> 00:03:10,732
the one thing that is working--

50
00:03:12,287 --> 00:03:13,100
you.

51
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:16,950
I'm not here because you're perfect.
I'm here because you're you--

52
00:03:17,271 --> 00:03:19,494
Human, beautiful--

53
00:03:20,365 --> 00:03:22,357
and I'm satisfied with you.

54
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:29,015
Tiger. You should probably
replenish your liquids.

55
00:03:29,601 --> 00:03:32,958
OK. Fill her up.
How about I satisfy you right now?

<i>Everett Poe</i>

60
00:04:32,684 --> 00:04:35,511
Mr. Poe, how long have you
been a plastic surgery addict?

61
00:04:36,018 --> 00:04:38,470
Well, I'm hardly what you
would call an addict.

62
00:04:40,224 --> 00:04:41,389
Really?

63
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:45,135
Let's see. You've had two rhinoplasties

64
00:04:45,313 --> 00:04:48,584
to reshape the nostrils and
straighten out the bone, right,

65
00:04:50,108 --> 00:04:53,464
a chin augmentation,
two blepharoplasties,

66
00:04:53,637 --> 00:04:55,024
a canthoplasty

67
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:58,284
to tighten up the bottom lid and
give you that catlike appearance there,

68
00:04:58,634 --> 00:05:01,530
a brow lift, two otoplasties...

69
00:05:02,588 --> 00:05:05,101
Am I missing anything?

70
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,720
- Chin reduction, not augmentation.
- My bad.

71
00:05:10,204 --> 00:05:12,672
No. It's actually Dr. Woodman's bad.

72
00:05:12,803 --> 00:05:15,583
I asked for a cleft.
Do you see a cleft on me?

73
00:05:16,412 --> 00:05:18,459
No. That's the one thing
on your face I don't see.

74
00:05:18,612 --> 00:05:20,019
It would've delineated the symmetry

75
00:05:20,156 --> 00:05:21,884
that I've been trying
so hard to achieve.

76
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:23,872
Now, that hardly makes me
an addict, does it?

77
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:27,095
I mean, a perfectionist, perhaps,
but in our business, that sort of

78
00:05:27,543 --> 00:05:30,539
- goes with the territory, doesn't it?
- Our business?

79
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:36,656
Yes. I own one of the top salons
in Beverly Hills-- Paragonia.

80
00:05:36,797 --> 00:05:39,042
Oh, I've heard of it,
home of the $800 haircut.

81
00:05:39,188 --> 00:05:40,489
Farmers get haircuts.

82
00:05:40,988 --> 00:05:42,336
My clientele are

83
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:45,509
limited to the|very rich and famous.
They don't come to me for haircuts.

84
00:05:45,655 --> 00:05:47,716
They come to me because they know

85
00:05:48,175 --> 00:05:51,869
that I understand
beauty is an olympic ideal.

86
00:05:52,591 --> 00:05:55,764
I face a mirror all day.

87
00:05:57,067 --> 00:05:59,917
Every time I look up, there I am.

88
00:06:00,525 --> 00:06:05,046
Now, if I'm striving to make my clients
pictures of perfection, then

89
00:06:05,644 --> 00:06:08,296
don't I owe
the same obligation to myself?

90
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:12,773
And this cleft chin,
it's gonna fulfill some kind of ideal?

91
00:06:13,042 --> 00:06:14,199
Dr. Troy,

92
00:06:14,705 --> 00:06:17,924
when an A-list celebrity is thinking
about getting a little work done,

93
00:06:18,195 --> 00:06:19,820
to whom do they turn,

94
00:06:20,356 --> 00:06:21,321
their maid

95
00:06:22,103 --> 00:06:23,421
or to someone like me

96
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:28,026
who has dedicated himself body and soul
to a universal standard of beauty?

97
00:06:30,893 --> 00:06:35,935
So, to whom do I send my $800 haircuts?

98
00:06:36,157 --> 00:06:38,203
I truly am at a loss.

99
00:06:40,721 --> 00:06:45,579
OK. So, this cleft-- Are we talking
Michael or Kirk Douglas?

100
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,247
My migraines had just gotten so bad

101
00:07:00,455 --> 00:07:03,074
that actually, it was my
mother, of all people,

102
00:07:03,193 --> 00:07:05,737
that suggested I got acupuncture.

103
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,200
I put two needles in her,
and, bingo, she starts to sob.

104
00:07:10,422 --> 00:07:14,146
And she let me stay
until I'd stopped, and then

105
00:07:14,253 --> 00:07:16,620
I invited her
out to dinner to thank her.

106
00:07:16,797 --> 00:07:19,249
And you're still thanking
each other, huh?

107
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:23,572
So, how did Annie deal
with the new situation? Did she freak?

108
00:07:24,614 --> 00:07:27,250
Well, you know
how she adores her aunt Liz,

109
00:07:27,396 --> 00:07:29,588
- so I just told her--
- You outted me to Annie?

110
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,579
Why? Is that something to be ashamed of?

111
00:07:31,732 --> 00:07:34,728
No. It's just that I wanted
to be able to tell her myself...

112
00:07:35,065 --> 00:07:36,828
Like when she's 60.

113
00:07:37,073 --> 00:07:39,663
Ladies, this is the 21st century.

114
00:07:39,888 --> 00:07:42,923
You can take off your corsets.

115
00:07:46,034 --> 00:07:48,623
Oh, I'm sorry. No. It's just,

116
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:52,288
Olivia said I should get used to PDA's--

117
00:07:52,487 --> 00:07:55,475
- Public Displays of--
- Of affection. I know.

118
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,046
So, how did Annie deal with it?

119
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:02,878
she's fine. I mean,
she sees how happy I am,

120
00:08:03,254 --> 00:08:08,081
that I'm more complete, that
there's no missing part of me.

121
00:08:08,648 --> 00:08:11,315
- You know how it is.
- Well, actually, no.

122
00:08:11,545 --> 00:08:12,817
Yeah. What's up with that?

123
00:08:13,032 --> 00:08:16,817
You're this beautiful, brilliant doctor,
and no one has grabbed you up yet?

124
00:08:16,966 --> 00:08:19,770
- Hard to believe, huh?
- Honey, look in the mirror,

125
00:08:20,023 --> 00:08:22,203
OK? you're one hot mama.

126
00:08:22,303 --> 00:08:25,253
You've got sexy spilling out
of every pore, doesn't she?

127
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,475
I'm surprised you two never went for it.

128
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:31,689
Oh, Liz is like family.
It'd be like going out with your sister.

129
00:08:32,047 --> 00:08:34,010
Well, call me stupid.
You're married with kids.

130
00:08:34,225 --> 00:08:35,941
I sort of assumed
that you were straight.

131
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,567
Lesbian lesson number one--
Never assume.

132
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,856
Time's up.

133
00:08:41,055 --> 00:08:42,998
Do you have an appointment?
I'll give you a lift.

134
00:08:43,151 --> 00:08:46,393
Lesson two-- hotel sex:hottest kind.

135
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:49,518
We've got this incredible suite
overlooking Hollywood.

136
00:08:49,686 --> 00:08:51,645
I always stay there
when I come out on business

137
00:08:53,101 --> 00:08:54,235
Thank you.

138
00:08:54,465 --> 00:08:55,645
- Thank you.
- All right.

139
00:08:55,824 --> 00:08:58,582
Let's go take advantage
of the kids not being around.

140
00:08:59,732 --> 00:09:03,088
- I can't wait to do you on the balcony.
- Come on. Stop it.

141
00:09:06,272 --> 00:09:07,897
And you hang in, OK?

142
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,620
She's out there.
You just have to have a little faith.

143
00:09:28,074 --> 00:09:30,913
- Thar she blows, laddy!
- Damn it, Christian. She got sick.

144
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,035
Oh, come on. It's no big deal.
There are plenty of women out there.

145
00:09:34,245 --> 00:09:37,356
- Some are even potty trained.
- Well, I'm not like you, OK?

146
00:09:37,487 --> 00:09:40,322
You see the slightest imperfection
in a woman, and, poof, you're gone.

147
00:09:40,521 --> 00:09:43,480
Well, news flash-- the only kind
of woman who doesn't fart

148
00:09:43,697 --> 00:09:47,046
and cry and look like crap in the
morning is either inflatable or dead.

149
00:09:47,192 --> 00:09:49,099
Sean, you're not gonna
start dating the shitter.

150
00:09:49,224 --> 00:09:50,138
Stop saying that.

151
00:09:50,264 --> 00:09:53,470
Come on. How can you look at her naked
body and not think,"rubber sheets"?

152
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,535
I got some leftover sloppy Joe's.
Any takers?

153
00:09:57,224 --> 00:09:59,569
No, thank you, Liz. Asshole.

154
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:02,848
Was it something I said?

155
00:10:02,986 --> 00:10:05,844
I tell you, man, that guy is
the job of the dating world.

156
00:10:06,021 --> 00:10:08,097
First, julia moves to Lesbaynia.

157
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:10,118
Then bachelorette number two--

158
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:13,066
Julia is just a tourist.

159
00:10:13,203 --> 00:10:16,115
She hasn't taken up residency,
and I don't think she plans to.

160
00:10:18,947 --> 00:10:21,461
I thought she had the hots
for that Olly chick.

161
00:10:22,105 --> 00:10:23,637
Gay, straight, who wouldn't be?

162
00:10:23,837 --> 00:10:26,610
Olly is incredibly beautiful.

163
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:30,468
So she's just bi-curious?

164
00:10:30,621 --> 00:10:32,645
Right now, Olivia is
something dangerous and new,

165
00:10:32,752 --> 00:10:36,154
more satisfying than what she had
with Sean, but this isn't it for her.

166
00:10:36,544 --> 00:10:38,827
You can see that
every time Olivia touches her.

167
00:10:40,728 --> 00:10:42,031
Poor sean.

168
00:10:42,276 --> 00:10:44,862
I tell you, that Julia
keeps you guessing, don't she?

169
00:10:44,962 --> 00:10:47,103
At least she doesn't shit
in the hot tub.

170
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,571
They told me to come right in,
so at's what I did.

171
00:11:06,663 --> 00:11:07,996
And you are...

172
00:11:09,267 --> 00:11:11,886
Weston, Eden,
like in "The garden of."

173
00:11:12,097 --> 00:11:14,407
No. I meant, you are...

174
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,520
How old?

175
00:11:16,684 --> 00:11:18,928
Old enough. I just turned 18.

176
00:11:20,774 --> 00:11:23,760
Is your mother or father
going to be present?

177
00:11:24,077 --> 00:11:26,979
I don't perform surgical procedures
on anyone under

178
00:11:27,832 --> 00:11:30,549
21 without parental approval.

179
00:11:31,517 --> 00:11:33,902
My father is not really in
the picture anymore,

180
00:11:35,244 --> 00:11:36,052
and...

181
00:11:36,325 --> 00:11:39,274
I'd be too embarrassed to talk
about it in front of my mother.

182
00:11:41,143 --> 00:11:42,521
What is it you want me to do?

183
00:11:43,907 --> 00:11:45,201
Surgically, I mean.

184
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:50,041
My hymen broke while I was riding
my stupid horse at school.

185
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,686
I could feel it rip deep inside.

186
00:11:53,496 --> 00:11:55,074
I want you to reconstruct it.

187
00:11:58,797 --> 00:12:02,057
Why don't we call your mother and
just talk to her about your problem?

188
00:12:02,314 --> 00:12:05,430
I'm still a virgin, ok, and I want to
decide who to give it to.

189
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:07,759
I don't want some damn horse
deciding it for me.

190
00:12:08,693 --> 00:12:10,477
I mean, blow jobs don't count.

191
00:12:10,725 --> 00:12:12,720
That's just like kissing someone,
you know,

192
00:12:13,038 --> 00:12:14,080
and anal is cool.

193
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:17,063
I mean, guys don't mind as long as
they get to stick it in somewhere,

194
00:12:17,232 --> 00:12:19,613
but your virginity,
that's a sacred hole.

195
00:12:20,793 --> 00:12:22,990
It's a gift you give to someone
you care about.

196
00:12:23,344 --> 00:12:26,236
You know, I'm not

197
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,034
comfortable having this conversation
without a parent present.

198
00:12:31,131 --> 00:12:34,624
Is that why you're squirming
around like that, because you're

199
00:12:34,874 --> 00:12:35,920
not comfortable,

200
00:12:37,676 --> 00:12:39,028
or are you hard?

201
00:12:47,021 --> 00:12:48,605
You need to leave.

202
00:12:49,616 --> 00:12:52,564
You know, I could make
that erection go away for you.

203
00:12:57,824 --> 00:13:00,105
I'd let you put it in my mouth, my ass.

204
00:13:01,193 --> 00:13:02,986
2 out of 3 is not bad, right?

205
00:13:07,377 --> 00:13:08,485
Maybe another time.

206
00:13:11,317 --> 00:13:14,752
It was nice meeting you.
You're even hotter than you are on tv.

207
00:13:23,757 --> 00:13:25,926
- Who is it?
- Dykes on bikes.

208
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:30,832
We're having a "Welcome to L.A."
weenie roast with real weenies.

209
00:13:34,059 --> 00:13:35,768
What are you doing here?

210
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:39,472
Can't an old friend come by
and see how an old friend is doing?

211
00:13:39,892 --> 00:13:40,944
Look at you.

212
00:13:41,897 --> 00:13:43,108
I love this place.

213
00:13:43,272 --> 00:13:46,883
I wish you'd called because
i'm meeting olivia, and

214
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,397
I have to get ready.

215
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,764
Just slam on a pair of jeans
and some birkenstocks, and

216
00:13:50,898 --> 00:13:52,148
you're good to go, right?

217
00:13:52,275 --> 00:13:54,907
What's this that you're reading,
"Lesbians at mid-life"?

218
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,339
You need a how-to book.

219
00:13:56,443 --> 00:13:58,494
I thought this kind of stuff
just came naturally.

220
00:13:59,292 --> 00:14:01,972
- This is very interesting.
- Collected writing, literary work.

221
00:14:03,185 --> 00:14:04,960
You mean like
"The vagina monologues"?

222
00:14:08,554 --> 00:14:10,671
Do you have a problem
with my sexuality?

223
00:14:10,807 --> 00:14:12,700
I've always had a problem
with your sexuality,

224
00:14:12,831 --> 00:14:14,636
and you've always
had a problem with mine.

225
00:14:14,767 --> 00:14:16,692
That may have been true once,
but not any more.

226
00:14:17,142 --> 00:14:18,836
Why, because you're a lesbian?

227
00:14:19,982 --> 00:14:22,482
- Because I'm in love with Olivia.
- Bullshit.

228
00:14:22,732 --> 00:14:25,364
For the first, time we have
the opportunity to tell each other

229
00:14:25,523 --> 00:14:27,683
how we feel, and you pull
this lesbian crap.

230
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,894
Unbelievable.

231
00:14:30,278 --> 00:14:32,705
You think I'm with
a woman because of you?

232
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:35,434
I think you're with a woman
because deep down, you realized

233
00:14:35,537 --> 00:14:37,500
that you can't fall in love
with another man.

234
00:14:37,747 --> 00:14:41,529
Your ego is so huge, it's a wonder
your head doesn't explode.

235
00:14:41,918 --> 00:14:44,873
It's the only thing bigger than my cock,
if you recall.

236
00:14:45,672 --> 00:14:47,053
Or do men disgust you now?

237
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,101
You know what?

238
00:14:51,711 --> 00:14:52,979
I am gay, Christian.

239
00:14:54,201 --> 00:14:57,413
I feel like I'm being authentic
for the first time in my life.

240
00:14:57,892 --> 00:14:59,751
So, what we had wasn't authentic?

241
00:15:01,702 --> 00:15:03,364
What we had was

242
00:15:03,815 --> 00:15:06,087
exciting and illicit

243
00:15:06,895 --> 00:15:08,237
and full of fantasy.

244
00:15:11,365 --> 00:15:13,806
This has nothing to do with you.

245
00:15:13,938 --> 00:15:14,860
It's just that...

246
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:17,996
women have a greater level
of sensitivity.

247
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,416
Sensitivity, my ass.

248
00:15:24,193 --> 00:15:25,508
Remember how this felt, huh?

249
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,640
You know what that feels like?

250
00:15:29,902 --> 00:15:31,996
Puzzle pieces fit, baby. Admit it.

251
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,217
Let me make love to you.

252
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:38,266
What's the worst that can happen
that I'm right,

253
00:15:38,886 --> 00:15:41,449
- that we stop running?
- Damn it, Christian!

254
00:15:42,593 --> 00:15:43,816
You want honesty?

255
00:15:44,488 --> 00:15:46,157
You can't stand the fact that

256
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,688
I am happy without you,
that I'm in love with someone else.

257
00:15:51,893 --> 00:15:53,893
You keep lying to yourself,
sweetie pie.

258
00:15:54,309 --> 00:15:56,139
One day, the novelty will wear off,

259
00:15:57,228 --> 00:15:59,837
and you'll realize you missed
your one chance at true happiness.

260
00:16:01,719 --> 00:16:03,363
Olivia is a nice piece of ass,

261
00:16:04,001 --> 00:16:06,499
but she can never get
inside you the way that I can.

262
00:16:22,286 --> 00:16:23,901
So, this is nice, huh?

263
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:26,954
Kind of like being back in Florida.

264
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:29,906
How's school going?

265
00:16:30,504 --> 00:16:32,543
Mom says it's a little
bit of an adjustment

266
00:16:32,655 --> 00:16:35,726
just because everything is new,
which is totally understandable.

267
00:16:36,509 --> 00:16:37,843
I want to come live with you.

268
00:16:38,843 --> 00:16:41,233
Sweetie, it takes time.

269
00:16:41,361 --> 00:16:43,453
You don't know any of the kids yet,

270
00:16:43,584 --> 00:16:46,000
It's not the school. It's mom.

271
00:16:47,101 --> 00:16:48,294
Her being gay?

272
00:16:53,842 --> 00:16:55,495
It's pretty new for her,
too, you know?

273
00:16:58,047 --> 00:16:59,856
I just want to live here with you.

274
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,477
Can i, daddy?

275
00:17:29,978 --> 00:17:34,216
How about I talk it over with
your mom, and then we'll see.

276
00:17:43,757 --> 00:17:45,316
sometimes when things are different,

277
00:17:45,945 --> 00:17:47,722
you just have to get used to them.

278
00:17:47,979 --> 00:17:49,741
Then they're not so bad, you know?

279
00:17:50,763 --> 00:17:51,845
Hey, Annie.

280
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,185
That's cute suit,
but lay off the carbs, pudge.

281
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,533
Annie's fanny is starting
to look like a blubber butt.

282
00:18:07,485 --> 00:18:10,208
- How do you know that girl?
- Eden? She's Olivia's daughter.

283
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,410
Want some?

284
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:26,412
My mom likes to loosen her girls up
before she nails them.

285
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:30,183
Julia is quite the screamer, by the way.

286
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:34,237
Why didn't you tell me
you were Olivia's daughter?

287
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,650
You mean use my real name?

288
00:18:37,025 --> 00:18:38,575
Would've spoiled all the fun.

289
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:44,383
You know, if Julia is my new mommy,

290
00:18:45,028 --> 00:18:46,629
that practically makes you my daddy.

291
00:18:48,247 --> 00:18:49,610
Don't you want to be my daddy?

292
00:18:49,723 --> 00:18:52,380
What I want is for you
to stay away from my daughter.

293
00:18:52,626 --> 00:18:54,157
You mean my little sister?

294
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,928
She's so sweet and impressionable.

295
00:18:59,485 --> 00:19:00,715
I have so much to teach her.

296
00:19:00,819 --> 00:19:02,490
You're a real little bitch, aren't you?

297
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,513
What did you just call my daughter?

298
00:19:04,661 --> 00:19:06,550
Your lovely daughter showed up
at my office

299
00:19:06,691 --> 00:19:08,644
requesting a hymen reconstruction.

300
00:19:08,763 --> 00:19:10,294
I don't care
if she asks for a third tit.

301
00:19:10,412 --> 00:19:12,584
You're never to use that word
in reference to her again.

302
00:19:12,695 --> 00:19:13,691
What's going on?

303
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,025
Hi, Julia.

304
00:19:15,274 --> 00:19:17,377
I didn't know you were here.
It was so quiet.

305
00:19:17,505 --> 00:19:19,150
What's the matter, mom,
have an off day?

306
00:19:19,272 --> 00:19:22,361
Sweetheart, don't think that
by going on the offensive,

307
00:19:22,493 --> 00:19:24,391
we'll forget that
you're the one in trouble.

308
00:19:25,163 --> 00:19:26,914
So, who popped your cherry?

309
00:19:27,724 --> 00:19:29,545
Charles. He's black.

310
00:19:30,755 --> 00:19:32,615
And that should make a difference?

311
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,039
He was too big for me.

312
00:19:34,617 --> 00:19:35,662
It hurt when

313
00:19:36,317 --> 00:19:37,209
I rode him.

314
00:19:37,649 --> 00:19:40,165
You thought you couldn't come to
your mother because

315
00:19:40,337 --> 00:19:41,727
I was in the way?

316
00:19:41,968 --> 00:19:43,602
No, Julia. You're not in the way.

317
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:45,850
You aren't even here. God.

318
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:47,967
Don't talk to her that way.
I won't allow it.

319
00:19:48,224 --> 00:19:50,193
I bet you don't even know
the first thing about

320
00:19:50,325 --> 00:19:52,128
who this Charles is,
where he comes from.

321
00:19:52,241 --> 00:19:55,146
I told you, Charles is
a goddamn black stallion,

322
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,526
you racist piece of shit.

323
00:19:57,226 --> 00:19:59,836
Even if that's true,
I'm sure it wasn't her first horse.

324
00:20:00,845 --> 00:20:02,234
Your daughter came to me

325
00:20:02,488 --> 00:20:05,613
to have her hymen redone. Doesn't that
make you a little bit uncomfortable?

326
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,191
Julia is always talking about
how you're one of the top

327
00:20:09,313 --> 00:20:10,534
surgeons in the country,

328
00:20:10,813 --> 00:20:13,174
so I assume she went to you
because you were the best.

329
00:20:13,789 --> 00:20:16,296
Maybe the discomfort is subjective,
doctor.

330
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,101
Can I talk to you
for a minute outside?

331
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:32,109
- What is wrong with you?
- It's about Annie.

332
00:20:32,361 --> 00:20:34,941
I don't think this is a good arrangement
with you and Olivia.

333
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:36,697
For her or for you?

334
00:20:37,329 --> 00:20:38,859
If you're worried about Annie

335
00:20:39,108 --> 00:20:40,914
seeing her mother with
another woman, don't.

336
00:20:41,045 --> 00:20:42,407
She seems perfectly fine.

337
00:20:42,654 --> 00:20:44,072
That's not what she told me.

338
00:20:45,326 --> 00:20:46,418
What did she say?

339
00:20:46,528 --> 00:20:48,942
She says she wants to live with me,
that she's not comfortable

340
00:20:49,077 --> 00:20:50,705
with everything that's going on.

341
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:55,852
I don't believe that.
She never mentioned anything.

342
00:20:57,546 --> 00:20:59,752
She loves you.
She doesn't want to hurt you.

343
00:21:00,334 --> 00:21:01,806
She's not happy.

344
00:21:05,228 --> 00:21:06,627
She's my baby, Sean.

345
00:21:07,939 --> 00:21:09,291
I don't want to lose her.

346
00:21:42,082 --> 00:21:44,015
- You're late. We started without you.
- Sorry.

347
00:21:44,257 --> 00:21:45,888
I got a little hung up at Julia's.

348
00:21:46,911 --> 00:21:48,733
Pass me the roto-osteotome,
would you?

349
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,787
Unless, of course,
you want to do the honors.

350
00:21:53,975 --> 00:21:55,012
There you go.

351
00:22:05,141 --> 00:22:06,587
how'd everything go with Julia?

352
00:22:06,866 --> 00:22:08,471
Julia is fine. It's Annie.

353
00:22:09,153 --> 00:22:12,017
She's uncomfortable
with the whole Julia gay thing.

354
00:22:12,626 --> 00:22:14,485
She wants to live out here with me.

355
00:22:14,736 --> 00:22:17,170
I can talk to her, Sean.
At that age, it's all about fitting in.

356
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,865
Maybe she's right.

357
00:22:18,981 --> 00:22:20,540
Maybe I'm the one
who's having trouble with it.

358
00:22:20,652 --> 00:22:21,460
Maybe.

359
00:22:21,578 --> 00:22:24,423
Maybe I don't want to see her with
someone else, male or female.

360
00:22:24,548 --> 00:22:26,474
Maybe Annie is picking up
on something from me.

361
00:22:28,245 --> 00:22:29,701
You know what I think you should do?

362
00:22:29,813 --> 00:22:32,823
You should take Kate on one of
those romantic california weekends,

363
00:22:32,936 --> 00:22:35,255
you know, like shutters down
in Santa Monica

364
00:22:35,358 --> 00:22:37,133
or something like that.
Forget about julia.

365
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:39,405
You're suggesting
I take the shitter to shutters?

366
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:41,808
Look. I was wrong.
You were right. We're all human.

367
00:22:41,908 --> 00:22:42,969
Everybody poops.

368
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,802
Julia doesn't need you to take care
of her problems anymore, Sean.

369
00:22:45,924 --> 00:22:47,971
You're a free agent.
You should just go for it.

370
00:22:57,014 --> 00:22:58,702
Eden is rebelling.

371
00:22:58,873 --> 00:23:01,420
Rember how you always wanted
to shock your parents?

372
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:04,714
Well, most kids go through
that stage, but

373
00:23:04,834 --> 00:23:07,800
when your mother is a lesbian,
it's a tough act to follow.

374
00:23:08,732 --> 00:23:11,878
She's giving it a hell of a try. Look.

375
00:23:12,244 --> 00:23:16,069
Gay or straight, as parents,
we need to set limits.

376
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,166
I think she could use a few more.

377
00:23:18,869 --> 00:23:21,080
Her story about the horse was true.

378
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,817
I checked with her riding instructor.

379
00:23:23,316 --> 00:23:26,580
After a particularly difficult hurdle,
she had blood on her uniform.

380
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:28,619
Look.

381
00:23:30,997 --> 00:23:32,239
She's been through a lot.

382
00:23:32,863 --> 00:23:36,548
Being different, having me for a mom
isn't easy on a kid,

383
00:23:37,186 --> 00:23:40,333
and if, for once in her life,
she wants to be like the other girls

384
00:23:40,524 --> 00:23:42,459
in her class, I want her to have that.

385
00:23:44,745 --> 00:23:46,130
I'm signing the consent form.

386
00:23:46,797 --> 00:23:48,250
I'm not comfortable doing this.

387
00:23:48,613 --> 00:23:50,549
Julia would never approve.

388
00:23:50,815 --> 00:23:53,463
Oh, she already has.
She says medically, you're the best,

389
00:23:53,695 --> 00:23:56,769
and as far as your ethics are concerned,
she trusts you completely.

390
00:23:58,785 --> 00:24:01,855
I'd have to see
how extensive the tear is.

391
00:24:19,884 --> 00:24:21,789
What if you can't repair it?

392
00:24:21,991 --> 00:24:24,457
We'll have to use a dermal
regenerative template.

393
00:24:25,364 --> 00:24:27,518
I'd shape it to an exact fit,

394
00:24:28,142 --> 00:24:31,718
replicating the natural fenestrations
that would allow normal secretions.

395
00:24:37,748 --> 00:24:39,813
I want your hands on me any way I can.

396
00:24:44,228 --> 00:24:45,988
I'm sorry you don't agree
with my decision.

397
00:24:46,834 --> 00:24:50,184
I'm just doing the best job I can,

398
00:24:50,849 --> 00:24:52,396
and I know you will, too.

399
00:25:15,864 --> 00:25:17,062
What's the matter?

400
00:25:22,545 --> 00:25:23,606
Matt, what--

401
00:25:25,414 --> 00:25:27,318
I've left kimber, dad.

402
00:25:27,479 --> 00:25:29,238
I've taken the baby.

403
00:25:30,144 --> 00:25:31,925
I really need your help.

404
00:25:39,492 --> 00:25:41,026
She's beautiful, Matt,

405
00:25:41,857 --> 00:25:44,540
but you can't just take her
and disappear.

406
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:47,257
- It's kidnapping.
- No. Kimber knows she's with me.

407
00:25:47,377 --> 00:25:49,918
She doesn't care. She can't handle
being a mother right now,

408
00:25:50,038 --> 00:25:51,711
and she doesn't want anything
to do with me.

409
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,856
I've been declared a suppressive person.

410
00:25:55,128 --> 00:25:57,586
- What the hell is that?
- It's this whole campaign

411
00:25:57,706 --> 00:25:59,534
they wage against people
who leave, you know?

412
00:25:59,654 --> 00:26:02,002
I mean, they take your property.
They take your kids.

413
00:26:02,122 --> 00:26:04,400
There was no way I was gonna let them
get their hooks into Jenna.

414
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,883
All right. Just relax, all right?
Here you go.

415
00:26:07,234 --> 00:26:08,254
Take a seat.

416
00:26:08,591 --> 00:26:11,564
Ok. Nothing is going to happen
to you now. You're with us.

417
00:26:14,766 --> 00:26:17,909
- Does your mother know?
- No, and I don't want her to.

418
00:26:18,029 --> 00:26:20,779
She's going through enough right now
coming out to everybody.

419
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:25,296
I don't know. I was thinking maybe
I could give it a try out here,

420
00:26:25,416 --> 00:26:27,128
you know, start over.

421
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:30,377
If I can make a few thousand bucks,
find a place to live,

422
00:26:30,763 --> 00:26:34,210
- maybe check into school, I think--
- You've got 250 grand, Matt.

423
00:26:34,437 --> 00:26:38,254
I can't think of a better time
to dip into it.

424
00:26:43,427 --> 00:26:44,511
The money is gone.

425
00:26:48,424 --> 00:26:49,774
She gave it to the church.

426
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:52,896
All of it?

427
00:26:54,495 --> 00:26:57,412
- Jesus, Matt, that was our house.
- I didn't know she was doing it.

428
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:59,212
That's my house,
everything I worked for.

429
00:26:59,332 --> 00:27:01,040
How could you have entrusted her
with that kind of money?

430
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,289
He loved her, Sean.

431
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:05,114
He didn't know the bitch
was gonna to rip him off.

432
00:27:12,118 --> 00:27:13,588
Look. Here's

433
00:27:15,015 --> 00:27:17,763
a few hundred bucks to tide you over.
I'll pay the first

434
00:27:17,883 --> 00:27:19,676
couple month's rent
when you find a place.

435
00:27:21,121 --> 00:27:21,925
Thanks.

436
00:27:22,093 --> 00:27:24,150
Great. You be the good father
and watch him take

437
00:27:24,303 --> 00:27:26,855
everything you ever did for him
and flush it down the toilet.

438
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:28,703
Dad, look.

439
00:27:30,674 --> 00:27:34,161
I'm sorry, ok? I screwed up.
It's unforgivable,

440
00:27:34,622 --> 00:27:38,117
you know, and I wish there were
do-overs in life like when you're a kid.

441
00:27:42,198 --> 00:27:43,317
I have to change her.

442
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:01,838
Come on. Cut the kid some slack.

443
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:05,542
He can't help it if he was born
with his brains in his dick.

444
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,651
He's just like his daddy.

445
00:28:28,859 --> 00:28:31,077
I'm having a great time.

446
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:33,911
- I wish you were here.
- Sorry.

447
00:28:35,365 --> 00:28:37,510
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just--

448
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:43,272
- I'm just off.
- Off or off me?

449
00:28:43,477 --> 00:28:47,213
- Beginning to question my technique.
- No. Don't.

450
00:28:47,883 --> 00:28:53,555
You have a very good technique.
You have a great technique.

451
00:28:55,573 --> 00:28:58,249
I'm just, oh, I don't know. I'm just--

452
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:03,599
I'm just distracted, you know,
with Sean and Annie and--

453
00:29:03,719 --> 00:29:06,410
That Christian is a piece of work,
isn't he?

454
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:08,910
Mm, yeah. Yeah.

455
00:29:11,821 --> 00:29:14,625
- You know what I think we should do?
- What?

456
00:29:16,166 --> 00:29:17,998
I think we should get married.

457
00:29:18,946 --> 00:29:21,043
We could drive to Boston
when we get home.

458
00:29:21,163 --> 00:29:23,341
The girls can be maids of honor.

459
00:29:24,766 --> 00:29:26,638
Oh, God, Olivia, I--

460
00:29:27,128 --> 00:29:28,683
I just don't think I'm up for this.

461
00:29:28,803 --> 00:29:31,375
You know, I don't think
Annie is up for it.

462
00:29:31,495 --> 00:29:34,352
You know, I don't know that I am.

463
00:29:34,818 --> 00:29:35,943
I am.

464
00:29:37,566 --> 00:29:38,401
I love you...

465
00:29:40,475 --> 00:29:42,274
Orgasm or no orgasm.

466
00:29:44,677 --> 00:29:45,938
Sooner or later, I just--

467
00:29:47,971 --> 00:29:49,490
I just want the world to know it.

468
00:30:00,067 --> 00:30:02,791
Oh, sweetheart, wait.

469
00:30:04,297 --> 00:30:06,185
I just have to go to the bathroom.

470
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:21,180
I'm sorry. It's not you.

471
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:26,812
It's me. I'm just distracted.

472
00:30:27,453 --> 00:30:29,888
My daughter is going
through a tough time.

473
00:30:54,905 --> 00:30:56,472
<i>Ride me, baby.</i>

474
00:30:57,042 --> 00:30:58,368
<i>Ride me.</i>

475
00:31:03,185 --> 00:31:05,355
<i>Yes! Full gallop.</i>

476
00:31:07,381 --> 00:31:08,908
<i>Harder, harder.</i>

477
00:31:52,145 --> 00:31:54,202
These sheets are real soft.

478
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,213
The blood supply seems healthy.

479
00:32:04,663 --> 00:32:07,071
The risk of rejection is what
we mostly worry about

480
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:08,851
with the majority of allografts.

481
00:32:10,442 --> 00:32:11,945
It feels very tender.

482
00:32:12,065 --> 00:32:14,379
It will for a couple of days.

483
00:32:15,537 --> 00:32:18,317
There's some slight swelling, nothing

484
00:32:19,193 --> 00:32:20,639
unusual.

485
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,890
It's real sensitive

486
00:32:25,501 --> 00:32:26,859
all along here.

487
00:32:27,542 --> 00:32:29,728
Whenever I touch it,

488
00:32:30,332 --> 00:32:31,931
it seems so--

489
00:32:32,831 --> 00:32:34,341
I don't know.

490
00:32:35,336 --> 00:32:39,305
Once the sutures are removed,
the extreme sensitivity

491
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:40,808
should lessen.

492
00:32:42,008 --> 00:32:44,049
Not too much, I hope.

493
00:32:44,844 --> 00:32:46,475
That'd be a drag.

494
00:32:48,328 --> 00:32:52,354
Do I have to worry about tearing
my new hymen

495
00:32:52,667 --> 00:32:55,503
when I touch myself like this?

496
00:32:58,902 --> 00:33:01,738
I'll recommend another practice
for your follow-ups.

497
00:33:01,883 --> 00:33:04,262
I don't want to see
you in here again ever.

498
00:33:21,525 --> 00:33:26,097
I couldn't leave L. A.
without seeing the pacific ocean.

499
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:35,017
I was driving around,
and I just kept thinking,

500
00:33:36,053 --> 00:33:38,279
"what if he's right?"

501
00:33:39,508 --> 00:33:45,848
"What if I'm running away from
the only thing that I have ever wanted?"

502
00:33:52,081 --> 00:33:53,391
Listen.

503
00:33:55,826 --> 00:33:56,902
It's beautiful, isn't it?

504
00:34:00,357 --> 00:34:01,916
It's the world's oldest song.

505
00:34:12,103 --> 00:34:14,064
May I have this dance?

506
00:35:27,386 --> 00:35:29,603
I should be the one to tell Sean,

507
00:35:30,254 --> 00:35:32,263
unless, of course, you want to.

508
00:35:32,882 --> 00:35:33,684
No.

509
00:35:34,585 --> 00:35:36,168
Then I'll tell him.

510
00:35:36,795 --> 00:35:39,254
He'll be upset at first,
but he'll come around.

511
00:35:40,636 --> 00:35:42,605
He loves us both.

512
00:35:43,055 --> 00:35:44,999
I'm sure he wants us to be happy.

513
00:35:53,855 --> 00:35:55,527
He'll find someone, you know?

514
00:35:58,805 --> 00:36:02,437
Did he tell you what happened with
that tv actress that he's been seeing?

515
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:05,474
Oh, my God, that guy sure can pick them,

516
00:36:05,884 --> 00:36:07,829
present company excluded, of course.

517
00:36:08,954 --> 00:36:11,915
He's going to have to learn
how to live without you, you know?

518
00:36:15,235 --> 00:36:17,404
I've been doing it for years.
Now it's his turn.

519
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:23,181
Is that what gave you an orgasm,

520
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,008
imagining the look on Sean's face
when you told him we were together?

521
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:31,150
That's ridiculous.

522
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,102
I love you.

523
00:36:34,212 --> 00:36:37,193
How can you love
what you can't even see?

524
00:36:42,547 --> 00:36:43,359
Where you going?

525
00:36:45,785 --> 00:36:46,774
Home.

526
00:36:49,257 --> 00:36:51,756
Olivia said that the only way
I'd get you out

527
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:54,033
of my system was to sleep with you.

528
00:36:55,548 --> 00:36:57,236
I guess she was right.

529
00:37:32,729 --> 00:37:33,702
Mattie?

530
00:37:37,711 --> 00:37:40,331
Do you know when Christian
is gonna get back?

531
00:37:40,459 --> 00:37:42,331
I wanted to ask him if he could--

532
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:49,054
You know what? Never mind.
It's not important. I'm sorry.

533
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,211
You need some money?

534
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:55,924
What did Christian give you,
a couple of hundred?

535
00:37:56,486 --> 00:37:57,692
Here.

536
00:37:58,768 --> 00:38:01,086
No. No. It's ok, dad.

537
00:38:01,206 --> 00:38:03,573
You made your stance on that
real clear. I got it.

538
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:08,755
I was wrong.

539
00:38:09,639 --> 00:38:12,074
I overreacted.

540
00:38:14,283 --> 00:38:16,623
Let me help you out.
I'll make it out to cash.

541
00:38:19,514 --> 00:38:23,547
- Um, why the sudden change?
- We all make mistakes, right?

542
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:26,807
We all just keep trying to do better,

543
00:38:28,012 --> 00:38:29,635
be better people,

544
00:38:30,166 --> 00:38:32,134
overcome our weaknesses.

545
00:38:38,056 --> 00:38:41,351
It took guts to do what you did.
Take it.

546
00:38:42,331 --> 00:38:44,605
Leave Kimber, start fresh.

547
00:38:46,448 --> 00:38:47,922
I'm proud of you.

548
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:08,010
Did you get it?

549
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:14,792
I got $300 worth,
courtesy of my two dads.

550
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:20,193
Daddy Mac gave me a big fat check
to help me get me back on my feet.

551
00:39:20,313 --> 00:39:22,893
Next week, it's mommy's turn to save me.

552
00:39:24,263 --> 00:39:27,369
- Hey, I think she's hungry.
- She's fine, Matt.

553
00:39:27,489 --> 00:39:29,534
Will you help me with this, please?

554
00:40:30,509 --> 00:40:32,654
Patron Silver, please.

555
00:40:39,761 --> 00:40:40,774
Thank you.

556
00:40:51,385 --> 00:40:53,499
Well, Helen didn't exaggerate.

557
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:57,412
She said you would be over
6 feet tall and gorgeous,

558
00:40:58,778 --> 00:41:01,871
although she said you'd be sitting
at the other end of the bar.

559
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:12,214
Do I pay for the drinks now,
or should I put it on my hotel bill?

560
00:41:16,564 --> 00:41:19,272
- And you are...
- Valerie Farell.

561
00:41:21,678 --> 00:41:24,016
I probably shouldn't have used
my real name.

562
00:41:24,458 --> 00:41:26,804
Oh, well. Too late.

563
00:41:30,099 --> 00:41:31,779
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

564
00:41:33,256 --> 00:41:35,787
I'm afraid I've never done this before--

565
00:41:36,277 --> 00:41:37,900
paid for someone.

566
00:41:49,021 --> 00:41:50,130
Tell me,

567
00:41:54,276 --> 00:41:56,550
does your husband

568
00:41:57,209 --> 00:41:59,884
know how you spend
his hard-earned money?

569
00:42:02,427 --> 00:42:04,637
Only if there's life after death.

570
00:42:08,083 --> 00:42:09,168
Sorry.

571
00:42:10,607 --> 00:42:11,450
Don't be.

572
00:42:12,974 --> 00:42:14,951
He's much better off to me that way.

573
00:42:19,757 --> 00:42:24,450
My husband owned most of the city
of Santa Clarita, California.

574
00:42:24,622 --> 00:42:27,041
He was a very powerful man

575
00:42:27,577 --> 00:42:29,079
in every way but one.

576
00:42:30,909 --> 00:42:34,573
Well, as they say, money
can't buy you everything.

577
00:42:38,574 --> 00:42:42,286
As long as it can buy you.

578
00:42:45,087 --> 00:42:46,493
Campbell, isn't it?

579
00:42:47,193 --> 00:42:48,896
I think that's what Helen said.

580
00:42:54,344 --> 00:42:57,639
- Is it enough?
- Depends on what you're thinking.

581
00:43:00,555 --> 00:43:05,322
3 or 4 years ago, we had one of the
worst droughts in California history.

582
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:08,536
The fruit just withered on the vine,

583
00:43:09,761 --> 00:43:11,673
and then it rained,

584
00:43:12,818 --> 00:43:14,747
and it all came back.

585
00:43:15,546 --> 00:43:18,848
It's been a long dry season.

586
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:36,154
Wwell, I hope you brought an umbrella

587
00:43:38,402 --> 00:43:41,174
because they're predicting
thunder storms.

588
00:44:23,817 --> 00:44:27,485
I know Matt is an adult
and i'm not supposed to worry, but

589
00:44:27,605 --> 00:44:29,948
when was the last time
you heard from him?

590
00:44:30,502 --> 00:44:32,575
Oh, you know how it is with a new baby.

591
00:44:33,066 --> 00:44:36,633
Yeah. I guess with Kimber
and the church, he's got his hands full.

592
00:44:37,445 --> 00:44:42,459
So, what did you decide about Annie?
You said you figured something out.

593
00:44:42,949 --> 00:44:45,432
Actually, it was her idea.

594
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:52,437
He was so checking you out.
Here. Let me have those.

595
00:44:53,136 --> 00:44:56,029
So, did mommy tell you? Isn't it great?

596
00:44:56,165 --> 00:44:59,673
Annie wants to go to preston,
the school where Eden goes.

597
00:44:59,793 --> 00:45:01,822
It's right outside of Santa Barbara.

598
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:06,225
Isn't it wonderful?
I'll be able to look out for her 27/7

599
00:45:06,345 --> 00:45:07,832
Like a real big sister,

600
00:45:09,383 --> 00:45:11,071
and it's only an hour away, so

601
00:45:11,272 --> 00:45:13,954
daddy can come visit
whenever he wants to.

602
00:45:18,752 --> 00:45:21,394
