00:00:00,751 --> 00:00:01,982
<i>Previously on Nip/Tuck...</i>

2
00:00:02,149 --> 00:00:04,180
Fiona Mcneil, publicist.

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,082
I have a unique opportunity

4
00:00:06,325 --> 00:00:08,263
that would fit you guys
like a surgeon's glove.

5
00:00:08,642 --> 00:00:10,121
Hearts'n scalpels.

6
00:00:10,305 --> 00:00:12,910
We start production on episode 6
on tuesday, and I have no case.

7
00:00:13,286 --> 00:00:14,507
We want producer credits

8
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,705
- and the occasional line.
- How soon can you start?

9
00:00:16,876 --> 00:00:19,377
Look. It's the new cute
doctor from Hearts'n scalpels.

10
00:00:19,635 --> 00:00:22,219
Plastic surgery is
an actor's worst nightmare.

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,570
Say I was gonna do
that exact same picture.

12
00:00:24,732 --> 00:00:25,964
Would you have to fix anything?

13
00:00:26,066 --> 00:00:27,577
Guess who just got a face-lift.

14
00:00:28,515 --> 00:00:29,745
Carly Summers.

15
00:00:31,192 --> 00:00:33,001
Tell me what you don't like
about yourself, miss...

16
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:34,321
Monroe.

17
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:37,116
I had it legally changed
for professional reasons.

18
00:00:37,849 --> 00:00:40,823
That's pretty good. I don't usually
go for the plus-size gals,

19
00:00:40,923 --> 00:00:43,846
but I always had a thing for Marilyn.
What do you do, parties, theme parks?

20
00:00:43,946 --> 00:00:44,973
The walk of fame.

21
00:00:45,099 --> 00:00:48,208
I stand outside Grauman's chinese
theatre and take pictures with tourists.

22
00:00:48,713 --> 00:00:50,418
- Theater pays you for that?
- No.

23
00:00:50,726 --> 00:00:53,575
I'm an independent contractor.
I work for tips.

24
00:00:53,677 --> 00:00:55,577
I was the highest earner on the block.

25
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,373
I made more than even Chewbacca
and Superman until she got in the way.

26
00:00:59,869 --> 00:01:01,426
Now no one wants me.

27
00:01:01,526 --> 00:01:02,892
They only want her.

28
00:01:04,495 --> 00:01:05,552
Sorry.

29
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:09,106
Late night on the set.

30
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:13,053
You were wonderful
in last week's episode, doctor.

31
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:17,546
Such dramatic intensity.
I would love to be on that show.

32
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,936
So you were talking about some
woman that you worked with.

33
00:01:21,276 --> 00:01:22,287
Sharon.

34
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,699
Who's Sharon do?

35
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:26,384
Anyone she can get
her slutty little hands on.

36
00:01:26,884 --> 00:01:29,923
She does Marilyn, too.
It used to be OK.

37
00:01:30,134 --> 00:01:33,272
She would do noon to 6:00,
and I would do 6:00 to midnight.

38
00:01:33,395 --> 00:01:34,450
We were friends.

39
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:35,617
What happened?

40
00:01:36,193 --> 00:01:38,175
First she started staying later...

41
00:01:38,284 --> 00:01:41,892
6:30, 7:00. Now she's there all night.

42
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:43,642
She has no boundaries.

43
00:01:45,414 --> 00:01:46,686
Here's the thing.

44
00:01:46,904 --> 00:01:49,548
Sharon's more talented than me.
I own that.

45
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:52,634
She has a wonderful voice,
and she dances like a dream,

46
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:55,467
but I have more star appeal.

47
00:01:56,031 --> 00:01:58,432
It used to be we each
had a piece of the pie,

48
00:01:58,534 --> 00:02:01,018
but now she's honing in on
my territory, and it's not fair.

49
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,979
The walk of fame has
become a battlefield, doctors.

50
00:02:04,081 --> 00:02:07,065
I need a bigger set of torpedoes
to give myself a competive edge.

51
00:02:07,167 --> 00:02:08,609
You want breast implants.

52
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:11,612
The idea being bigger boobies,
bigger tips.

53
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:12,946
Bingo, baby.

54
00:02:13,048 --> 00:02:15,657
OK, baby. So, look,
I don't mean to be rude,

55
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:18,598
but in your line of work, you sure
you gonna be able to afford this?

56
00:02:18,698 --> 00:02:19,803
I've saved up.

57
00:02:19,967 --> 00:02:22,374
Sure it hurts to crack
open the nest egg,

58
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,847
but what option do I have?
This is my livelihood.

59
00:02:27,753 --> 00:02:30,082
I have an opening on, thursday morning.

60
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,512
You're wonderful, Dr. Troy.

61
00:02:36,244 --> 00:02:39,389
But I couldn't pass up
the opportunity to work with a star.

62
00:02:40,175 --> 00:02:42,935
I was hoping Dr. Mcnamara could do me.

63
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:45,874
I'd be happy to do you.

64
00:02:46,494 --> 00:02:48,179
Thank you ever so.

<i>Joyce & Sharon Monroe</i>

68
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:39,551
Save a life. What's the stat, nurse?

69
00:03:39,685 --> 00:03:42,466
40-year-old construction worker
severed the right arm in the field.

70
00:03:42,566 --> 00:03:44,454
Severed right arm!
We have a severed right arm!

71
00:03:44,581 --> 00:03:47,570
- 1, 2, 3.
- Vitals! Vitals! I need vitals!

72
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:50,878
I need a tray of instruments here.
Arm. Give me the arm.

73
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:54,573
I will have this man
swimming the breast stroke

74
00:03:54,673 --> 00:03:57,050
in the nile by the end of this year,
so help me god!

75
00:03:57,188 --> 00:03:58,950
Nurse, I want an esmarch bandage, stat.

76
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,805
- That was the last one, doctor.
- What?

77
00:04:00,905 --> 00:04:01,804
We're all out.

78
00:04:01,904 --> 00:04:03,363
How could a hospital
be out of tourniquets?

79
00:04:03,463 --> 00:04:05,935
9 construction workers were hit
by that falling saw blade, Jamie.

80
00:04:06,035 --> 00:04:07,350
This is not Baghdad.

81
00:04:07,454 --> 00:04:10,081
Severed limbs are not an
everyday occurrence at seaside general.

82
00:04:10,207 --> 00:04:11,838
We'll dealing with a severe
arterial hemorrhage, doctor.

83
00:04:11,938 --> 00:04:14,067
- He's going into shock.
- OK, Peter, go round up some neckties.

84
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:16,695
- What?
- Oh, goddamn it! It's casual friday!

85
00:04:16,802 --> 00:04:19,531
Wait! He's going into shock.
We're gonna lose him.

86
00:04:19,633 --> 00:04:23,341
That's enough. That's enough.
That's enough. That's enough.

87
00:04:23,453 --> 00:04:27,956
I got you. Don't worry.
It's not tight enough, doctors.

88
00:04:28,099 --> 00:04:31,668
- I need it tighter!
- Well, tighten it. Get a clamp! So...

89
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:35,713
- Somebody get a clamp, something!
- Get an ekg! Ekg! We need an ekg!

90
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:39,051
OK, cut.

91
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:42,387
Come on.

92
00:04:42,489 --> 00:04:44,556
What's wrong, darling?
You were perfection.

93
00:04:44,658 --> 00:04:46,892
How come I'm the only one
in my goddamn underwear?

94
00:04:46,994 --> 00:04:49,469
The network says we have
to show more skin.

95
00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:51,667
More exposure translates
to higher ratings.

96
00:04:51,767 --> 00:04:54,006
Well, why can't kate take her top off?

97
00:04:54,126 --> 00:04:55,869
I'd be like a deer
caught in those headlights.

98
00:04:55,969 --> 00:04:57,203
Aidan, you're a man tart.

99
00:04:57,303 --> 00:04:59,531
That's your job.
I am a classically trained actress.

100
00:04:59,631 --> 00:05:03,308
I know. I know.
Juilliard, royal shakespeare company...

101
00:05:03,408 --> 00:05:05,154
- Yeah, broadway. In the park.
- Oh, give me a break, kate, OK?

102
00:05:05,254 --> 00:05:07,926
The only reason why you have
this job is you're a hot piece of ass.

103
00:05:08,026 --> 00:05:09,097
Everybody knows that.

104
00:05:09,197 --> 00:05:11,697
She doesn't take her clothes off,
I'm not. You know, come on.

105
00:05:11,832 --> 00:05:14,534
I'm bloated.
You gave me 24 hours notice.

106
00:05:14,634 --> 00:05:18,305
That's lunch, everyone. 12:12 to 12:42.

107
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,671
Make it safe and walk away.

108
00:05:29,321 --> 00:05:32,944
Excuse me, Kate.
You were really good in there.

109
00:05:33,044 --> 00:05:35,881
- Really realistic.
- Thank you very much.

110
00:05:35,981 --> 00:05:38,921
I spent a week with Dr.
Sam Nussbaum over at cedars.

111
00:05:39,094 --> 00:05:41,697
You know, if you wanna
view one of our operations,

112
00:05:41,798 --> 00:05:44,259
you could scrub in,
see how we do it up close.

113
00:05:44,432 --> 00:05:48,453
Really? Wow. I... yeah.
That would be fantastic. When?

114
00:05:49,086 --> 00:05:50,789
Sorry. Hang on.

115
00:05:53,128 --> 00:05:54,376
Hi, mom

116
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:57,598
You're kidding. Well, are you sure?

117
00:05:57,955 --> 00:06:01,493
No, Sean wait!
Hey, mom, can I call you right back?

118
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,182
What are you doing sunday?

119
00:06:09,284 --> 00:06:11,476
We don't operate on sundays, so...

120
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:14,651
I know this is last-minute,
but my mom just canceled on me.

121
00:06:14,786 --> 00:06:16,148
Do you happen to have a tux?

122
00:06:17,475 --> 00:06:18,984
- A tux. I could get one.
- OK!

123
00:06:20,148 --> 00:06:21,161
6:00?

124
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:25,157
- 6:00. Yeah, 6:00. OK.
- Yeah. All right. OK.

125
00:06:51,559 --> 00:06:53,769
- I'm hearing a song for the first time.
- Yep.

126
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,146
Finally understand what it's about,
you know?

127
00:06:56,248 --> 00:06:58,273
Being famous, wanting a true connection.

128
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:00,901
I was mobbed at the dry
cleaners this morning.

129
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,652
I heard you tell the receptionist,
all right?

130
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,551
Enjoy your 15 minutes, buddy.
It's gonna be my time soon.

131
00:07:07,049 --> 00:07:09,423
By this afternoon,
the phones are gonna be jammed

132
00:07:09,523 --> 00:07:12,204
with people trying to get an
appointment with these famous fingers.

133
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,705
What happens this afternoon?

134
00:07:15,142 --> 00:07:18,148
The latest issue ofusmagazine
hits the shelves.

135
00:07:18,282 --> 00:07:22,306
A little birdie told me that, Carly
summers'face-lift is on the cover,

136
00:07:22,406 --> 00:07:25,927
along with the identity of a very,
very skilled plastic surgeon.

137
00:07:26,027 --> 00:07:29,467
- You leaked it?
- How could you? She's a friend of mine.

138
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:32,798
And I signed
a confidentiality agreement.

139
00:07:37,372 --> 00:07:39,915
I have no idea where
they got that story.

140
00:07:40,068 --> 00:07:42,317
I do. It came from me.

141
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,722
Take a closer look.

142
00:07:48,862 --> 00:07:53,054
"Carly summers attributes her youthful
new look to a daily regimen of juicing

143
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,802
and bikram yoga."

144
00:07:54,902 --> 00:07:57,290
Not exactly the story
you were hoping for, is it?

145
00:07:58,852 --> 00:08:02,208
Bold move going to the press
to land yourself some publicity,

146
00:08:02,314 --> 00:08:04,670
but ultimately idiotic, kiddo.

147
00:08:04,862 --> 00:08:08,260
If you had any idea how
the game was really played,

148
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:12,389
you would know Fiona Mcneil
has her hand so far up the ass

149
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,464
of every publisher in this town,

150
00:08:14,587 --> 00:08:17,581
they wouldn't consider taking
a dump without consulting her first.

151
00:08:18,234 --> 00:08:19,619
And speaking of dumping,

152
00:08:19,727 --> 00:08:21,496
you're out.

153
00:08:21,746 --> 00:08:24,034
Get yourself another publicist.

154
00:08:25,573 --> 00:08:27,821
- Wait. Fiona, I'm so...
- Sorry?

155
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:30,584
Corrupt? Save it.

156
00:08:33,123 --> 00:08:34,930
You're right. I'm an asshole.

157
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,122
The town's full of assholes.
What makes you special?

158
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,192
Nothing, absolutely nothing.

159
00:08:44,634 --> 00:08:46,865
You know,
I used to walk down the street,

160
00:08:47,011 --> 00:08:49,145
and people would look at me...

161
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:51,222
men, women.

162
00:08:52,068 --> 00:08:54,906
They all wanted to be me or be with me.

163
00:08:57,426 --> 00:08:58,964
Now it's just...

164
00:09:01,715 --> 00:09:03,157
I don't know who I am anymore.

165
00:09:04,542 --> 00:09:06,273
I still can't figure out

166
00:09:06,378 --> 00:09:08,320
why leak this story?

167
00:09:09,037 --> 00:09:10,053
Thanks to me,

168
00:09:10,153 --> 00:09:13,342
Mcnamara/Troy was getting an ample
piece of the plastic surgery pie.

169
00:09:14,231 --> 00:09:16,169
Mcnamara's getting the piece.

170
00:09:19,688 --> 00:09:23,957
And Troy's not content
with his partner's crumbs.

171
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:24,951
No.

172
00:09:29,198 --> 00:09:31,794
Look, I'm not proud of this.

173
00:09:32,582 --> 00:09:34,505
Sean's like a brother to me.

174
00:09:34,855 --> 00:09:37,009
I was the one who followed him out here,

175
00:09:37,663 --> 00:09:39,394
gave up everything I worked for...

176
00:09:39,567 --> 00:09:41,509
money, prestige, sex.

177
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:45,405
I had Miami by the balls.

178
00:09:45,578 --> 00:09:48,675
You were also, what,
20-something when you started?

179
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,239
You should have picked a different
venue to have a midlife cris in.

180
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:55,609
You're never going
to be the new face in town,

181
00:09:55,859 --> 00:09:58,820
just some 40-something
dying for a comeback.

182
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,397
You're the one who can give it to me.

183
00:10:03,481 --> 00:10:05,212
Please just give me another chance.

184
00:10:05,635 --> 00:10:07,385
I'll pay anything you want.

185
00:10:12,616 --> 00:10:14,551
Oh, goodness.

186
00:10:14,654 --> 00:10:16,628
You were a charming escortcort,
Dr. Mcnamara.

187
00:10:16,762 --> 00:10:20,051
- Well, thank you, darling. Thank you.
- You didn't know who anyone was.

188
00:10:20,985 --> 00:10:23,909
I can't believe that soap opera medical
show won. Are you kidding me?

189
00:10:24,043 --> 00:10:25,447
No, it's ratings. It's stupid.

190
00:10:25,678 --> 00:10:28,947
No, I was very impressed. When
they called that other actress'name...

191
00:10:29,074 --> 00:10:30,785
Mariska Hargitay. She always wins.

192
00:10:31,016 --> 00:10:34,477
Aw, whoever she is.
You handled it with such grace.

193
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:37,939
Everyone knew it should have been
you up there winning that award.

194
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:40,374
Oh, that's, um...

195
00:10:40,663 --> 00:10:43,028
that's really sweet, sean. Thank you.

196
00:10:52,189 --> 00:10:54,374
I wanted to do that in the limo.

197
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,027
- Is that my consolation prize?
- No, not at all.

198
00:10:58,239 --> 00:11:00,201
I've been wanting to do it all night.

199
00:11:00,412 --> 00:11:02,297
I guess I'm just a little rusty.

200
00:11:20,595 --> 00:11:22,180
Sean, you should go.

201
00:11:25,428 --> 00:11:26,793
Sean, the limo's waiting.

202
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,465
Please, I want you to go.

203
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:36,804
Are... are you crying?

204
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,420
You're not a very good listener,
are you?

205
00:11:41,554 --> 00:11:44,849
- I'm sorry. I did... I thought...
- You thought wrong.

206
00:11:46,371 --> 00:11:50,273
But Mcnamara/Troy did her boobies.
Well, Chewbacca told me so.

207
00:11:51,225 --> 00:11:53,975
Listen,
I could bring you in a ton of business.

208
00:11:54,149 --> 00:11:56,879
Aquaman's been telling me
he's considering pec implants.

209
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,707
Don't take this the wrong way,
sweetheart,

210
00:12:01,449 --> 00:12:04,810
but if the crazies of the world
wanna pay top dollar to worship

211
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:08,482
dead movie stars, maybe they're better
off going to madame tussauds.

212
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,853
You need to get yourself a life,
sweetie pie,

213
00:12:12,102 --> 00:12:13,756
one of your own.

214
00:12:15,122 --> 00:12:16,448
I tried.

215
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,948
I wanted to be an actress.

216
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,795
Just wasn't special enough.

217
00:12:22,806 --> 00:12:25,018
Just another face in the crowd,

218
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:28,210
except when it came
to impersonating her.

219
00:12:28,364 --> 00:12:29,748
She's a goddess, you know.

220
00:12:30,518 --> 00:12:32,614
And even though I know I'm just a copy,

221
00:12:34,183 --> 00:12:37,953
kinda made me feel like a goddess,
too, you know?

222
00:12:39,453 --> 00:12:40,703
Till she came along.

223
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:43,094
Joyce.

224
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:46,055
She's not as good as me, you know.

225
00:12:47,036 --> 00:12:49,259
But that doesn't matter here now,
does it? Because...

226
00:12:49,359 --> 00:12:52,548
she's just gonna wow the crowd
with her big new tits, and...

227
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:57,548
Steal tips that are rightfully mine.

228
00:13:01,298 --> 00:13:03,259
Do you know what that's like

229
00:13:04,067 --> 00:13:06,202
to be something special

230
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,226
and to watch someone

231
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,097
who doesn't deserve

232
00:13:12,674 --> 00:13:14,117
it take what belongs to you?

233
00:13:15,982 --> 00:13:17,886
I can pay, doctor.

234
00:13:20,428 --> 00:13:22,659
***********

235
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,118
Please...

236
00:13:44,307 --> 00:13:46,192
- Yeah?
- Christian.

237
00:13:46,307 --> 00:13:49,750
- Hey, Julia. What's up?
- Uh, I-is this a bad time? I could...

238
00:13:49,884 --> 00:13:51,019
No, no, no. No.

239
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,480
I got a photo shoot tomorrow.
I'm just wondering smile or no smile?

240
00:13:53,586 --> 00:13:58,819
Wow. A photo shoot?
You two are really taking L.A. By storm.

241
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,414
<i>I caught sean on the show.</i>

242
00:14:01,514 --> 00:14:03,221
Yeah, jesus. Did you see that thing?
What a piece of...

243
00:14:03,321 --> 00:14:08,379
I couldn't believe it was him.
He looked so handsome on camera.

244
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:12,398
Is he around? I was sort
of hoping to catch you both in.

245
00:14:12,546 --> 00:14:14,046
Is there something wrong?

246
00:14:14,214 --> 00:14:16,387
No. No, um,

247
00:14:16,676 --> 00:14:20,256
I just wanted to know if you
were both gonna be around next weekend.

248
00:14:20,358 --> 00:14:24,003
I was thinking of coming out,
and Annie has a little break, so,

249
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:26,824
you know, I thought it might be fun.

250
00:14:27,151 --> 00:14:30,182
Julia, I've known you for 22 years.

251
00:14:30,451 --> 00:14:33,645
You don't just hop on a
plane and cross-country on a whim.

252
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:34,896
Spill it.

253
00:14:36,703 --> 00:14:39,818
I'm... seeing someone,

254
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:41,684
<i>and it's serious.</i>

255
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,791
<i>We're moving in together.</i>

256
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,635
Jesus.

257
00:14:46,735 --> 00:14:50,286
I just didn't want to surprise
him with it on the phone.

258
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,887
<i>I'd rather do it in person.</i>

259
00:14:53,651 --> 00:14:55,555
But you don't mind surprising me?

260
00:14:57,517 --> 00:15:01,248
Well, we will talk about
it when I'm there, OK?

261
00:15:02,171 --> 00:15:05,125
I can't wait to see you. Bye.

262
00:15:14,909 --> 00:15:17,697
So when can I get out of here
and show off my new tits?

263
00:15:17,832 --> 00:15:20,370
Sharon's going to be
pea green with envy.

264
00:15:22,478 --> 00:15:23,690
Oh, I'm sorry.

265
00:15:23,978 --> 00:15:25,651
I thought this room was gonna be empty.

266
00:15:25,757 --> 00:15:27,448
What is she doing here?

267
00:15:27,786 --> 00:15:31,286
Trying to steal my doctor now,
you bitch?

268
00:15:31,401 --> 00:15:33,150
I was the one here first.

269
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,164
You're moving in on my turf again.

270
00:15:35,284 --> 00:15:37,208
I won't stay in here with that imposter

271
00:15:37,515 --> 00:15:39,361
I want my own room.

272
00:15:39,461 --> 00:15:41,504
I'm sorry, but this is the only one
that's available.

273
00:15:41,784 --> 00:15:45,199
Then kick her out.
You brought me in here.

274
00:15:45,315 --> 00:15:48,636
- You have to take care of me.
- Oh, I will.

275
00:15:50,198 --> 00:15:54,100
Did you actually go out, find that woman
and bring her here on purpose?!

276
00:15:54,672 --> 00:15:57,018
She came to me.
Her american express card worked.

277
00:15:57,118 --> 00:15:58,719
I made us some money.
What's wrong with that?

278
00:15:58,819 --> 00:16:00,273
You know, you trying to
one-up me all the time

279
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,921
is gonna drive patients away,
not bring 'em in the door.

280
00:16:03,021 --> 00:16:04,241
I wasn't trying to one-up you.

281
00:16:04,341 --> 00:16:05,820
And you know what?
I think this could be a positive thing.

282
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,989
You know, those girls,
they're good friends.

283
00:16:08,091 --> 00:16:10,192
Being locked up in a room together
could help 'em get back together.

284
00:16:10,292 --> 00:16:11,364
God, this is so like you.

285
00:16:11,464 --> 00:16:14,162
Any time I get a little taste of
something good, you can't handle it!

286
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:17,540
- Bullshit. Like when?
- Like, oh, I don't know, Julia.

287
00:16:18,323 --> 00:16:19,951
I meet the woman I'm gonna marry,

288
00:16:20,051 --> 00:16:22,378
and you have to sleep with
her the night before the ceremony?

289
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:26,018
I've apologized a thousand times.

290
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:28,727
What, do I have to apologize for the
new guy she's moving in with as well?

291
00:16:28,827 --> 00:16:31,012
- What?
- Nothing.

292
00:16:31,114 --> 00:16:33,969
What do you mean,
"the new guy she's moving in with"?

293
00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:37,101
Julia called the house yesterday.
She wanted to tell you personally, but,

294
00:16:37,678 --> 00:16:39,704
you know, she met someone.
She's moving in with him.

295
00:16:40,031 --> 00:16:42,568
Well, that's great.
She's seeing someone.

296
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:43,650
Since when are you seeing someone?

297
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:46,110
I'm having a little fling with
somebody on the show, an actress.

298
00:16:46,212 --> 00:16:47,537
Well, there's a bit
of a difference here.

299
00:16:47,637 --> 00:16:49,155
You're not moving in with
your current piece of ass.

300
00:16:50,246 --> 00:16:51,053
Yet.

301
00:17:03,468 --> 00:17:06,295
- Come on, let me apologize.
- You don't need to apologize.

302
00:17:06,395 --> 00:17:09,894
I do. I've given it a lot of thought,
and I see where I missed your signal.

303
00:17:09,994 --> 00:17:11,782
Look, I don't wanna talk about it,
OK? I just...

304
00:17:11,882 --> 00:17:12,821
What's wrong with you?

305
00:17:12,921 --> 00:17:15,556
I'm trying to defuse the situation.
That was no fun at all on the set today.

306
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:17,682
I want to apologize so we can move on.

307
00:17:17,782 --> 00:17:20,509
Wow. What? What,
you're a dreamboat and a gentleman?

308
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:22,703
I mean, is there anything
I can hate about you?

309
00:17:24,637 --> 00:17:29,766
Look, I'm the one that should apologize,
OK? I'm the crazy-ass bitch, not you.

310
00:17:30,497 --> 00:17:31,978
My god.

311
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:34,048
What, could I be more
of an insane person?

312
00:17:34,148 --> 00:17:35,410
You're an actress.

313
00:17:35,612 --> 00:17:38,458
A little passion is
part of the package, right?

314
00:17:38,746 --> 00:17:40,323
Look, I just...

315
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,996
I'm from New York, you know.

316
00:17:43,678 --> 00:17:45,640
It's a different world out here.

317
00:17:46,351 --> 00:17:47,928
I haven't learned how to tell if,

318
00:17:48,063 --> 00:17:51,592
you know, people like me or if they like
the fact that I'm a star of a hit show.

319
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,409
You know, I feel like
an imposter half the time.

320
00:17:54,751 --> 00:17:57,232
I mean, my idea of a fun evening is

321
00:17:57,405 --> 00:18:01,070
curling up with a cup of decaf
earl grey and a paddy chayefsky play.

322
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,713
You forget that I'm
new in this town, too.

323
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,609
All I know is the world of medicine.

324
00:18:06,417 --> 00:18:09,340
In fact, you're gonna have
to remind me who paddy chayefsky is.

325
00:18:11,321 --> 00:18:12,739
I like you, Sean,

326
00:18:16,219 --> 00:18:18,034
I guess... I don't know. I got scared

327
00:18:18,134 --> 00:18:21,546
when you liked me back so fast. That's
why I freaked out. I'm really sorry.

328
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,082
So we'll take a step back.

329
00:18:24,018 --> 00:18:25,634
We'll go slow.

330
00:18:29,065 --> 00:18:30,884
But the thing about me is that,

331
00:18:31,115 --> 00:18:34,126
you know,
whomever I date has to be a friend

332
00:18:34,605 --> 00:18:36,737
first and then a lover, you know?

333
00:18:36,953 --> 00:18:39,723
Totally. Totally. Friends.

334
00:18:41,739 --> 00:18:43,200
Friends.

335
00:18:47,066 --> 00:18:48,566
Friends who kiss?

336
00:18:57,734 --> 00:19:00,077
Great. Great, great.

337
00:19:03,099 --> 00:19:04,749
Oh, bellissimo.

338
00:19:07,854 --> 00:19:10,004
Oh, bellissimo.

339
00:19:10,335 --> 00:19:12,131
OK, bravo.

340
00:19:12,239 --> 00:19:14,046
We ready for the money shots?

341
00:19:14,146 --> 00:19:16,174
Why, you bet your wide-angle lens, baby.

342
00:19:17,404 --> 00:19:20,731
I need to go to the
storeroom for more film.

343
00:19:20,847 --> 00:19:22,654
I'll be ready when you get back.

344
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,434
Just stay chubby, tiger.

345
00:19:25,645 --> 00:19:27,184
I don't shoot hard-ons.

346
00:19:35,249 --> 00:19:37,484
I'm literally putting
my balls in your hands, Fiona.

347
00:19:37,584 --> 00:19:39,034
You sure this is...

348
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:44,647
- Shall I turn around?
- What's the point?

349
00:19:44,747 --> 00:19:47,667
It's not like you're not gonna see
it on the newsstands next week, right?

350
00:20:01,239 --> 00:20:03,066
What... what the hell?

351
00:20:04,827 --> 00:20:06,435
Don't look at me like that. Jesus.

352
00:20:06,537 --> 00:20:09,313
The last time my dick was this small,
I was still in diapers.

353
00:20:09,431 --> 00:20:12,854
Stage fright.
It's pretty common in these situations.

354
00:20:12,954 --> 00:20:14,861
Shit. We're gonna have
to call the whole thing off.

355
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:19,073
What are you, leg man, ass man, tit man?

356
00:20:19,175 --> 00:20:20,408
Tit man why?

357
00:20:20,999 --> 00:20:22,743
Mommy issues. Should have known.

358
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,209
Well, don't flatter yourself, shorty.

359
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:28,207
I put my neck on
the line for this shoot.

360
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:32,299
If your cobra doesn't dance,
i'm the one in trouble.

361
00:20:34,261 --> 00:20:36,411
Look, no offense but do you
really think the breasts

362
00:20:36,511 --> 00:20:39,078
of a woman your age are
gonna play the right tune?

363
00:20:41,644 --> 00:20:42,491
Jesus.

364
00:20:43,491 --> 00:20:46,392
- Fiona, they're fantastic.
- Why thank you.

365
00:20:47,087 --> 00:20:50,118
Don't know what it is,
genetics or just plain luck, but

366
00:20:50,252 --> 00:20:55,849
no matter how old I get, these champagne
cups seem to be frozen in time.

367
00:21:02,677 --> 00:21:05,369
I see we ready. grazie.

368
00:21:05,471 --> 00:21:06,704
- Prego.
- Oh, yeah, baby.

369
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:10,257
- We're ready.
- OK.

370
00:21:19,641 --> 00:21:21,141
- Hello.
<i>- Bad time?</i>

371
00:21:23,369 --> 00:21:25,542
It's the usual dinnertime madness.

372
00:21:25,658 --> 00:21:28,273
Oh, sorry.
I keep forgetting the time difference.

373
00:21:28,446 --> 00:21:30,728
- How are the kids?
<i>- They're wonderful.</i>

374
00:21:30,908 --> 00:21:33,105
Well, exhausting,

375
00:21:33,496 --> 00:21:36,484
but, um, annie can't
wait to come and see you.

376
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:39,195
She seems to have finally
adjusted to school.

377
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:43,354
<i>Of course, it helps that
her daddy's a television star.</i>

378
00:21:43,585 --> 00:21:45,961
Come on. I only say a line or two.

379
00:21:46,061 --> 00:21:49,719
Oh, well,
I think you're very believable.

380
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:53,499
Listen, christian tells
me that you've met someone and...

381
00:21:53,614 --> 00:21:57,787
Goddamn it, sean.
I didn't want you to hear it from him.

382
00:21:57,979 --> 00:22:01,801
You know christian.
He just pushes and pushes, and... ucch.

383
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:05,394
Julia, it's fine.
I'm glad you've met someone.

384
00:22:05,567 --> 00:22:07,014
I want you to be happy.

385
00:22:08,695 --> 00:22:11,231
It's just sort of
something that happened.

386
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:12,436
Hey, it's good.

387
00:22:13,002 --> 00:22:15,579
We both gotta get
on with our lives, right?

388
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,944
You know,

389
00:22:18,532 --> 00:22:20,552
I think I might have met someone.

390
00:22:21,321 --> 00:22:24,148
- It's a little too early to tell but...
- That's wonderful.

391
00:22:24,282 --> 00:22:28,052
Yeah. I don't want to put the cart
before the horse, but there's definitely

392
00:22:28,167 --> 00:22:29,244
something there.

393
00:22:30,264 --> 00:22:32,707
I mean, she's not your
typical actress or anything.

394
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,189
A-an actress?

395
00:22:34,843 --> 00:22:36,043
From the show?

396
00:22:36,593 --> 00:22:37,727
Yeah.

397
00:22:38,381 --> 00:22:41,007
And, uh, what about you?

398
00:22:41,327 --> 00:22:44,770
Tell me abo Mr. Right. Christian
says you're moving in together.

399
00:22:46,989 --> 00:22:49,682
I'll tell you all about it
when the kids and I come in to see you,

400
00:22:49,784 --> 00:22:53,269
OK? It's just a little crazy right now.

401
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:57,178
Sure. Sure, I'm sorry.

402
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:00,043
<i>Give 'em both big kisses for me.</i>

403
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:04,139
<i>- Take care, Jules.</i>
- Yeah. You, too.

404
00:23:14,179 --> 00:23:15,163
You OK?

405
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,386
- Hi.
- Hey. They let you out early.

406
00:23:28,421 --> 00:23:30,781
- How are you?
- Good. You know.

407
00:23:30,934 --> 00:23:33,345
There's this restaurant in Malibu.
It's right on the beach.

408
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:35,013
Actually, you know what, Sean?

409
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:37,249
This is sort of a professional call.

410
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:40,252
What could you possibly want changed?

411
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,121
Uh, well, it's about, uh, the show.

412
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:46,992
- Can we-- do you mind if I sit?
- Yeah. Yeah.

413
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:57,803
years ago, when some
casting agents saw me

414
00:23:57,969 --> 00:24:00,272
off-off-broadway, they said that

415
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:02,574
if I ever wanted to do the Hollywood
thing,

416
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:04,843
that I'd have to drop some weight,

417
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:07,012
you know, if I wanted a shot.

418
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:09,229
And I did. I wanted it badly.

419
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:12,032
I dropped the weight and then, um,

420
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:16,788
then I got plucked out of obscurity to
do this pilot, and--

421
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:22,096
I mean, I think it's only a matter
of time. I'm gonna have to do

422
00:24:22,237 --> 00:24:23,352
a nude scene.

423
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:25,762
I mean, Aidan's made
that really clear.

424
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:31,903
what is it, a little cellulite?
I mean, who cares?

425
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,872
- Look, show me. It's ok.
- I can't.

426
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:35,807
- It's ok.
- You know what? It's bad enough

427
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:38,376
the pictures of how I used to look are
showing up on the internet.

428
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,345
You haven't seen them yet, you will.

429
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:43,215
- Shit, I hate Google.
- Look, you can show me anything.

430
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:48,153
I mean, old pictures, you in the flesh,
I'm attracted to you.

431
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:52,858
Can you turn around?

432
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:55,360
- Yeah.
- Ok.

433
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:15,547
You're dating a plastic surgeon, ok?

434
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:20,051
I've pushed and pulled enough flesh to
know that beauty is more than skin-deep.

435
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:23,021
Ok. Y-you can turn around.

436
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:31,396
I, uh-- I had gastric bypass

437
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:35,267
to drop the weight, and after I lost
100 pounds, this is the result.

438
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,338
No problem.

439
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:14,406
Question. What's hot and bare

440
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:16,474
and hard all over?

441
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:20,204
- You remember what this is, Lizzie?
- Cheap porn.

442
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,727
Yeah. I'm familiar with it.

443
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:23,949
I can't believe you posed for that
magazine.

444
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:26,952
- What do you think? Huh?
- It is so Burt Reynolds, 1972.

445
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:29,154
- Thank you.
- Very becoming for a doctor.

446
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:32,123
You've heard of doctor without borders.
Meet doctor without dignity.

447
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:37,028
O-ok. Just for your information, Fiona
says that this publication is iconic.

448
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:38,196
Moronic?

449
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,565
Moronic, iconic. That's very good.
I like that.

450
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:43,602
See, here's my thinking. Only half of
Miami got to see my dick,

451
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:45,170
and look how much business
that brought in.

452
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:48,106
Wait until this little puppy comes out.
Look at that.

453
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:50,375
"Dr. Christian Troy." Ok?

454
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:53,445
This office won't be flooded.
It'll be underwater.

455
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,714
Right, big boy. Take your dick outside.

456
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:59,117
Huh? Does that make you feel sexy?

457
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,819
Let's do some stapling.

458
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:03,989
What's what's-her-face doing here?

459
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,753
She just wanted a few touch-ups.

460
00:27:06,987 --> 00:27:09,094
What, did she lose a hundred
pounds in a week or something?

461
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:11,062
This is the chick you took to the
awards thing, right?

462
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:13,390
Her name is Kate. She happens to be
pretty special.

463
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:16,644
She seems very special.
You just add a mast and good wind,

464
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:18,503
and you sail her around the planet.

465
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,338
I happen to like her, Christian.

466
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:22,294
I don't give a shit
if she was once fat.

467
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:27,450
Julia met someone.
You met someone. I get it.

468
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,915
The only thing you've got is a picture
of your cock in a magazine.

469
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:33,218
This magazine is gonna bring in

470
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:37,155
more of L.A.'s hotties than you could
ever imagine, my friend. This guy, ok?

471
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:39,240
Come on.
You won't have to settle for

472
00:27:39,381 --> 00:27:41,743
these rejects from
the Macy's day parade.

473
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:46,588
The phones haven't stopped ringing, and
you're booked solid all next week,

474
00:27:46,693 --> 00:27:49,230
and there's a walk-in waiting
for you in your office.

475
00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:51,569
Guess they wanna know
who the big dick is.

476
00:27:57,642 --> 00:28:00,278
Tell me what you don't like about
yourself.

477
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:02,200
What I don't like, sweetheart,

478
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:05,139
is that I don't have someone
like you in my life.

479
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:11,122
That I'm sitting here,

480
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:14,793
and you're sitting all the way over
there.

481
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:20,265
I'm, uh-- I'm not a dermatologist.
I don't do full body mole checks.

482
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:32,711
- Come to apologize?
- For what?

483
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:34,879
Filling your appointment book with
paying clients?

484
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:37,849
I promised to get you work,
not get you laid.

485
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,885
I didn't think you had any problem in
that department.

486
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:42,854
You certainly bedded carly
without my help.

487
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:45,090
So that's what this is about, huh?
Revenge?

488
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:50,128
People I get revenge on aren't
double-booked for 6 weeks ahead.

489
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:53,832
You have tapped
into thelifeblood of Hollywood.

490
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:56,101
Never heard of the gay mafia?

491
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,437
Get the boys, and everyone else follows.

492
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:04,476
Paul Lynde is waiting in your office,
Christian.

493
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:08,113
Ha. Screw you, boob tube boy.
And just for the record,

494
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:11,316
my layout has brought in twice as much
business at your crappy tv show.

495
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:14,786
Not only that, have you ever heard
about the gay mafia?

496
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,156
Tell him about the mafia.

497
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:20,191
Is your divorce final, Sean?

498
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:21,359
Yes. Why?

499
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:23,361
Good.  Means we won't have to fudge it.

500
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:26,164
People Magazine has requested you

501
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:29,334
for their "50 Most Eligible Bachelor"
issue.

502
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:31,836
- Him?
- I pitched you both, of course,

503
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:35,140
but Sean is the only one
on tv every week.

504
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,076
The photo shoot's tomorrow.
Can you work that?

505
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:40,979
Christian'll have to pick up a couple
of my patients, but

506
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:44,015
something like this could only
be good for business.

507
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:47,952
You can do Kate's follow-up for me,
can't you?

508
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:51,080
Sure.

509
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:01,866
Oh. Dr. Troy, is Sean coming?

510
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,047
You mean one of People Magazine's
50 most eligible bachelors?

511
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:08,506
He's at a photo shoot right now getting
his highlights redone.

512
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:10,175
You're kidding.

513
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:13,311
I was saying the same thing when I
heard it myself.

514
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:17,182
Ok, I need to see how you're healing.
Could you

515
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:20,318
- take off your gown for me, please?
- Oh. Sure.

516
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:21,786
Thanks.

517
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:31,162
Very nice.

518
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,868
You could do the sequel to
"9 1/2 Weeks" in a month and

519
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:39,838
nobody would know the difference.

520
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:42,640
And yet oddly, you seem disappointed.

521
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:45,977
No, it's, uh-- it's just I--

522
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,213
I thought Sean would wanna be here.

523
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:52,584
He hasn't really talked to me much
since the operation.

524
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:55,520
What can I expect, right? I mean--

525
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:58,577
He just shaved 20 pounds of loose
skin off my body. I'm not attractive.

526
00:30:58,718 --> 00:31:00,209
He can do so much better.

527
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,759
Is that what you think?

528
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:04,195
Once a fatty, always a fatty.
I know how men in this town are.

529
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:10,869
Well, I'm a man in this town, and I'd
be honored to have you on my arm.

530
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:15,206
Maybe, uh--

531
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,308
maybe we could go out to dinner.

532
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:23,648
You've always been beautiful.
Now you're--

533
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,818
now you're a complete knockout.

534
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:40,598
Careful where you poke down there.
I'm  gonna need that later.

535
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:43,134
- What are you doing?
- You like it?

536
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:45,837
I just got it from Barneys. Just need a
few adjustments, that's all.

537
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:47,105
Why do you need a tux?

538
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:50,341
People's Choice awards, my friend.
Black-tie affair.

539
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:53,611
And I told Kate I wouldn't be seen dead
in a rental.

540
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:57,649
You're going out with Kate, my Kate?
You can't be serious.

541
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:01,819
I wouldn't spend 2,000 bucks on a
brand-new suit just to be jokin' around.

542
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,122
Those fat comments during her surgery,

543
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:06,958
you just said all that to push me away
so you could swoop in, didn't you?

544
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:08,626
Now you're just bein' paranoid.
Wouldn't you be

545
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:11,229
if your best friend kept trying to take
away everything you ever cared about?

546
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:12,864
You never cared about Kate.

547
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:16,234
You're embarrassed by her. That's why
you did the surgery in the first place.

548
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:18,703
And just so you know,
she looks fantastic.

549
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:21,039
If there's anybody to blame, it's you.

550
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:23,675
Recovery-- we have a situation.

551
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:26,911
What's going on?

552
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:29,013
Her pulse is thready,
and she's nonresponsive,

553
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:31,282
and there's an empty bottle of pills
on the nightstand.

554
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:32,850
- Rozerem. Sleeping pills.
- She gonna die?

555
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,585
- Did you see how many of these she took?
- I don't know.

556
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:37,021
Give me a gastric lavage.
We need pump her stomach. Go.

557
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:38,790
What do you mean you don't know?
You're sitting 3 feet away from her.

558
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:39,724
- What happened?
- I don't know.

559
00:32:39,853 --> 00:32:41,893
We got in a fight over who'd work
the corner next week,

560
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:44,095
and I said she couldn't compete with me
anymore, and I went to the bathroom,

561
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:46,397
and when I came back, she was groggy,

562
00:32:46,543 --> 00:32:48,879
and she said she was happy
and she was finally gonna win.

563
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,164
- Win? Win what?
- I don't know. It didn't make sense.

564
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:53,604
She said after today, she was gonna go
down in history as the--

565
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:56,407
the best Marilyn Monroe in the biz.

566
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,010
- Jesus.
- Joyce, can you hear me?

567
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:01,512
How many pills did you take? Joyce!

568
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,082
Now we gotta do this.

569
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:05,717
- I got it.
- No, I got it.

570
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:09,053
Ok, it doesn't matter. Would one of you
please put it down her throat?

571
00:33:21,486 --> 00:33:23,720
- I was gonna grab that one, Sean.
- Oh, bullshit.

572
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:25,770
That's not bullshit.
I've hardly eaten all day.

573
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,192
I need something to tide me over.

574
00:33:27,341 --> 00:33:29,240
What happened to,
"I'm lactose-intolerant"?

575
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,005
But I am asshole-intolerant,
so take it outside

576
00:33:32,146 --> 00:33:34,987
or take up a sport where you both
can beat the crap out of each other

577
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,548
somewhere else,
'cause I'm sick of watchin' it.

578
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:40,551
A woman almost died
under your watch today,

579
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,121
and you deal with it
by fightin' over a Yoplait?

580
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:45,356
Give me the Yoplait. Give it to me.

581
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:46,424
Knock, knock.

582
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:49,127
- Hey, uh--
- Julia.

583
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,529
- I didn't think you were coming till--
- We weren't expecting you.

584
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:55,199
- I didn't mean to interrupt.
- Oh, doesn't matter.

585
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:58,269
They never listen to me anyway.
I'm just white noise in a lab coat.

586
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,938
- Jules, what are you doin' here?
- I decided

587
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:05,243
to just come, you know. I-it felt so
awkward on the phone, I thought,

588
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:07,478
why wait?

589
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:09,947
This is an important move for me,
and, uh,

590
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:13,651
I need you two to be onboard,
well, for the kids.

591
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:17,221
I left them with my mother, and she's
gonna bring them in a couple of days.

592
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:20,658
Oh, of course we're onboard.
I'm sure if you like him,

593
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:23,961
he's gotta be great.
We just want you to be happy.

594
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:26,030
- Exactly.
- Thanks

595
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,231
So--

596
00:34:28,552 --> 00:34:29,985
When do we get to meet
the lucky bastard?

597
00:34:30,102 --> 00:34:31,770
You bring him with you or what?

598
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,906
- Ollie's not actually--
- Ollie?

599
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,843
Ollie. Sounds very upper crust.
Is Ollie rich?

600
00:34:39,176 --> 00:34:39,986
Yes,

601
00:34:40,714 --> 00:34:41,548
very.

602
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:44,450
And it's Olivia.

603
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:08,706
So how long you been playin' shnooker?

604
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:11,509
I got into it late in life.

605
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:14,312
- I had a good teacher.
- I bet you did.

606
00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:17,949
What's a dyke bar without a gang of
Minnesota fats wannabes?

607
00:35:18,082 --> 00:35:21,152
- My daughter taught me.
- You have a daughter? That's fantastic.

608
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:23,354
What about dad? Did you pull him
out of the drawer

609
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:24,789
for thanksgiving to baste the turkey?

610
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:28,126
She was conceived in my college dorm
the good, old-fashioned way,

611
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:33,197
by adding 2 hard bodies,
a quart of rum and stirring.

612
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:36,067
Very kinky.

613
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:38,269
So where's papa now?

614
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:41,639
Where do you think? After he
impregnated me, I bit off his head.

615
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:44,609
How did your mother respond
when she found out?

616
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,445
Well, you know Erica.

617
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:50,848
She thought that being in a more
egalitarian relationship

618
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:54,385
would be good for me until she found
out that Olivia was a doctor

619
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:57,755
of traditional chinese medicine,
and then-- ho.

620
00:35:57,855 --> 00:36:00,158
She became "a lesbian snake-oil
peddler."

621
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:02,560
I bet I started lookin'
pretty good to her.

622
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:09,700
So is Olivia your first?

623
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:17,909
I don't know if it's a question of
being gay or not, Sean. I just

624
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:21,913
fell in love with her.
you were in love with me.

625
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,650
yes, but this is different somehow.

626
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,953
You know, it's easier--

627
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:32,390
the sex, communication.

628
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:36,194
So you ever fantasize about women
when I was screwing you?

629
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:41,899
Wes, but it-- you know, a lot of
straight women do.

630
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:43,534
It's common.

631
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:47,305
I am so sorry, Sean.

632
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:51,242
I put you through hell, and maybe

633
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:54,445
all the time, this was the reason why.

634
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,350
- I kicked his ass.
- True. She did.

635
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:01,886
- You ready, babe?
- Oh, why not stay for dinner?

636
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:04,889
You can explain the indigo girls
phenomenon.

637
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,291
We have a dinner date with my daughter.

638
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:11,762
I'll be in town until sunday.
Um, we'll have dinner at the weekend.

639
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:14,077
Bye.

640
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:23,341
I can't stop wondering.

641
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:25,443
You think she yells out "Ollie"
or "Livie" when she's--

642
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,840
- Shut up.
- I didn't say anything.

643
00:37:26,981 --> 00:37:29,380
It's what you're not saying.
It's what I know you're thinking.

644
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,918
Just say it.

645
00:37:31,059 --> 00:37:33,959
You're thinking she wouldn't be
a lesbian if she'd been married to you,

646
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,954
that I must be such a lousy lay
that my wife

647
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:40,707
went from dwarf humping to carpet
munching. It's not funny.

648
00:37:40,961 --> 00:37:43,448
I'm not laughing at you. I'm laughing
at us. I mean, come on.

649
00:37:43,566 --> 00:37:45,198
It is funny. Think about it.

650
00:37:46,153 --> 00:37:48,199
After all these years Julia
was the reason for our

651
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:51,469
"who's got the biggest dick" contest,
now we find out

652
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:53,104
she doesn't even like 'em.

653
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:56,974
She's a dyke.

654
00:37:57,074 --> 00:37:59,343
- Julia is a dyke.
- Don't call her that.

655
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:02,546
- You get that.
- She's the mother of our children, ok?

656
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:05,950
- Carpet muncher's nicer.
- Beaver bumper.

657
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,451
Muff diver.

658
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,123
- Oh, my god.
- Oh, my god.

659
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,363
Well, now neither of us gets her.

660
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:22,867
Too bad she didn't figure it out
when we were in college.

661
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:25,436
I've spent a lot of years barkin' up
the wrong tree.

662
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:32,513
Look,

663
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:36,614
I only went after Kate
because you wanted her.

664
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:37,915
I-- I'm sorry, all right?

665
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:41,419
I don't know what it is. It's like
I'm hypnotized or something.

666
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:48,559
Here.

667
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:51,295
That'll make up for the last time.

668
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,201
She's yours, not mine.

669
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:04,875
Thank you.

670
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:23,828
- Kate?
- Be right down.

671
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:31,102
Wow. You look beautiful.

672
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:34,572
- Please accept my apologies.
- For what?

673
00:39:35,756 --> 00:39:38,609
Pretending to be a great guy and then
disappearing? Where's Christian?

674
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:41,645
He bowed out when I told him that
we were seeing each other.

675
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:45,082
So I don't have a say?

676
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:48,252
You two just played "pass the fat girl"
and assume

677
00:39:48,352 --> 00:39:50,755
I should be grateful that anyone shows
up at my doorstep at all?

678
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:53,524
Am I caught in the middle of some
weird game that you two get off on?

679
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:54,592
Absolutely not.

680
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:57,695
I mean, my partner has a definite eye
for the ladies,

681
00:39:57,862 --> 00:40:00,464
but the reason I kind of disappeared

682
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:03,701
has nothing to do with you.
I got caught up.

683
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:06,704
My ex-wife came to town, and

684
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:10,007
she came to inform me
she's in a new relationship.

685
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:13,544
Are you still in love with her?

686
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:20,651
Trust me. Julia and I are over, truly,
finally over.

687
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:23,821
That's why I'm here.

688
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:28,692
Puthese in some water,

689
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,729
and I'll wait for you in the limo.

690
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:37,701
I'll drive. We can play the chauffeur
and the naughty starlet.

691
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,339
Why is it so hard to say no to you?

692
00:40:43,507 --> 00:40:45,643
Because I look so handsome in this tux?

693
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:52,750
Come on, Kate.

694
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:56,754
I don't wanna go.

695
00:40:57,388 --> 00:41:00,057
You think that Hargitay lady's gonna
kick your ass again?

696
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:06,197
I am just sick of actors competing with
other actors for meaningless trophies.

697
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:08,799
Yes, she's gonna kick my ass again.

698
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:11,268
I'm gonna kiss you.
Are you gonna hit me?

699
00:41:11,368 --> 00:41:12,336
I don't know.

700
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:29,520
Why don't we stay in, order out,

701
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:33,591
- and watch an old movie?
- That sounds perfect.

702
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:45,236
Come on in here, cutie.

703
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:15,799
Cheeseburger.
Say, that's all right, mama.

704
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:18,836
- God bless you. Thank you, sweetie.
- Hey, Elvis.

705
00:42:19,803 --> 00:42:20,971
Elvis.

706
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:24,241
Hey, fat Elvis. Hey, hey.
Come here for a second.

707
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,609
What's up, man?

708
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,978
I'm lookin' for Marilyn Monroe,

709
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:30,047
actually 2 Marilyn Monroes.
You seen 'em?

710
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:32,383
Yeah, I might know
where they're at, baby.

711
00:42:33,617 --> 00:42:34,552
All right.

712
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:37,655
Right over there, amongst
all the asian tourists.

713
00:42:37,788 --> 00:42:39,290
- Beautiful.
- Go get 'em, pa.

714
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:43,661
All right. Come on,
who's next for Elvis?

715
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:01,445
Whatever happened to the battle
of the blondes?

716
00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:04,481
Dr. Troy. What are you doing here?

717
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:07,551
I always do follow-ups
on my movie star patients.

718
00:43:08,152 --> 00:43:09,386
What happened?

719
00:43:09,553 --> 00:43:12,022
We decided that 2 Marilyns
were better than one.

720
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:14,091
Especially since Joyce
came up with the idea

721
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:16,520
of us both wearing the costume
from the Seven Year Itch.

722
00:43:16,661 --> 00:43:19,863
It really shows off our brand-new tits,
don't you think?

723
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:22,046
I can't think of a better way
to advertise.

724
00:43:22,187 --> 00:43:23,725
Maybe you should hand out my card.

725
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:27,504
We'd love to, especially since you're
the reason that we're friends again.

726
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:29,506
You did save my life,

727
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,142
but you made me realize
my life was worth saving.

728
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,578
If only the real Marilyn
had had as good a friend.

729
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:37,848
Oh, yes, but if only she had as good
a business mind as you do.

730
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:41,318
We're making moremore money together
than we ever did competing.

731
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:43,187
That's for sure.

732
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,357
I think I know a way
you can make more money

733
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:49,250
than just standing
on this corner, ladies.

734
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:53,030
What did you have in mind?

735
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:12,549
Make me feel like a star.

736
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:17,287
<i>I wanna be loved by you</i>

737
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:19,156
<i>just you,</i>

738
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:23,293
<i>nobody else but you</i>

739
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:29,767
<i>I wanna be loved by you alone,</i>

740
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:37,841
<i>I wanna be kissed by, you, just you,</i>

741
00:44:38,575 --> 00:44:41,445
<i>nobody else but you,</i>

742
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:48,652
<i>I wanna be kissed by you alone</i>

743
00:44:50,685 --> 00:44:54,336
<i>Dr. Troy. Oh, you're wonderful.</i>

744
00:44:55,182 --> 00:44:58,329
