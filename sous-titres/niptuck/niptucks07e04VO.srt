00:00:01,085 --> 00:00:02,584
<i>Previously on nip tuck...</i>

2
00:00:02,704 --> 00:00:04,219
This is really bad.

3
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:06,089
How come I don't feel guilty?

4
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:07,774
We need to stop doing this.

5
00:00:07,894 --> 00:00:09,524
You're not goin' back to him,
are you?

6
00:00:09,644 --> 00:00:12,032
- He's my husband, Sean.
- You deserve better.

7
00:00:12,152 --> 00:00:14,140
You'll never make me happy.

8
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:15,785
I can never love you enough.

9
00:00:15,905 --> 00:00:19,020
We've hit a rough patch.
You don't break up because of it.

10
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,394
He's done with me now.

11
00:00:20,514 --> 00:00:22,711
Good. He's doin' you
a favor, Kimber.

12
00:00:22,831 --> 00:00:23,974
It's a gift.

13
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,625
Kimber fell off
a boat last night.

14
00:00:27,745 --> 00:00:29,172
She's missing.

15
00:00:34,845 --> 00:00:38,095
Oh, my goodness
these are so good.

16
00:00:38,215 --> 00:00:40,517
Here. I'll go get you
some food, ok?

17
00:00:41,118 --> 00:00:43,785
Weather report says it should
be clear through the weekend.

18
00:00:43,905 --> 00:00:44,787
That'll help.

19
00:00:44,907 --> 00:00:46,506
It's been 2 days, Sean.

20
00:00:46,626 --> 00:00:50,116
If the coast guard's not givin' up,
then we can't either.

21
00:00:52,869 --> 00:00:54,335
You want some noodles?

22
00:00:54,455 --> 00:00:56,183
Jesus,
what are you doing, Matt,

23
00:00:56,303 --> 00:00:57,594
feeding the kid Thai food?

24
00:00:57,714 --> 00:00:59,397
It's too spicy.
What's your problem?

25
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:00,404
Take it easy.

26
00:01:00,524 --> 00:01:02,390
Wanna get pissed at
someone, be mad at Hamoui.

27
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,390
If the police didn't charge
him with anything,

28
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,309
what the hell am I gonna do?

29
00:01:09,139 --> 00:01:10,104
Hello.

30
00:01:10,701 --> 00:01:11,761
Hi, Brandie.

31
00:01:11,829 --> 00:01:13,605
No, you're
at the right place.

32
00:01:13,725 --> 00:01:15,402
Ok.
See you in a minute.

33
00:01:15,819 --> 00:01:17,311
It's Kimber's mom.

34
00:01:17,431 --> 00:01:19,419
Have you really
never met her?

35
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:21,509
Kimber kicked her out of
her life a long time ago,

36
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:23,206
didn't invite her
to the wedding, so...

37
00:01:23,326 --> 00:01:24,608
What happened
between them?

38
00:01:24,728 --> 00:01:26,915
"Unresolved issues"
is what I heard.

39
00:01:33,436 --> 00:01:34,604
Christian.

40
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:36,823
You made it.

41
00:01:36,943 --> 00:01:38,771
- Heh. Hi.
- Hi.

42
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:42,639
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too. Hi.

43
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,250
Hey, didn't you, uh,

44
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,200
say you were bringing
someone with you...

45
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,890
Les is coming tomorrow.

46
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:51,606
He's got business, so...
I'm here.

47
00:01:51,726 --> 00:01:52,574
Ok.
Come in.

48
00:01:52,694 --> 00:01:54,209
Wow, this is right
on the water.

49
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:56,419
- Brandie, I'm Sean.
- Hello, Sean.

50
00:01:56,539 --> 00:01:58,986
Hi. I'm a friend of
Christian's and your daughter.

51
00:01:59,106 --> 00:01:59,810
Hi.

52
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,843
Hey. I'm, uh...
I'm Matt.

53
00:02:01,963 --> 00:02:02,996
You're Matt.

54
00:02:03,347 --> 00:02:04,872
So this must be Jenna.

55
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:05,870
Yeah.

56
00:02:08,613 --> 00:02:11,687
Wow. This is
a lot to take in...

57
00:02:12,054 --> 00:02:15,326
son-in-law, a granddaughter,
an ex-son-in-law.

58
00:02:16,654 --> 00:02:19,825
I wish it could be under
different circumstances.

59
00:02:22,393 --> 00:02:25,147
Well, the important part is
we're all here now.

60
00:02:25,798 --> 00:02:26,790
That's right.

61
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:27,893
Hey,
little one,

62
00:02:28,013 --> 00:02:30,096
you wanna go back
and finish coloring? Ok.

63
00:02:30,997 --> 00:02:33,237
I was just thinking
on the way here that

64
00:02:33,357 --> 00:02:35,260
when Kimmy
was a little girl,

65
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,568
I taught her how to swim

66
00:02:36,688 --> 00:02:38,637
in the lake that
was near our house, and...

67
00:02:38,757 --> 00:02:41,075
she just loved the water
so much, you know?

68
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:43,812
She was such
a good swimmer. Just...

69
00:02:44,413 --> 00:02:47,480
I just hope that everything
is gonna be all right.

70
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,865
And she's tough.

71
00:02:48,985 --> 00:02:50,487
Yeah, she is.

72
00:02:52,237 --> 00:02:54,657
That was the coast guard.
They're...

73
00:02:55,221 --> 00:02:57,027
callin' off the search.

82
00:03:59,315 --> 00:04:01,348
Jenna, sweetheart,
it's time to go.

83
00:04:01,468 --> 00:04:02,446
Go?

84
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:07,660
Don't you think it's a little
soon to be uprooting her?

85
00:04:07,944 --> 00:04:09,221
Uprooting her?

86
00:04:09,341 --> 00:04:10,449
I'm her father.

87
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:11,938
Yeah, but come on.

88
00:04:12,058 --> 00:04:14,508
Please, act like an adult
for once in your life.

89
00:04:14,628 --> 00:04:16,491
What, you gonna take her
to your shithole?

90
00:04:16,611 --> 00:04:20,309
Who's gonna take care of her
when you're lookin' for a job?

91
00:04:20,429 --> 00:04:24,069
Well, my shithole is a sunny
studio is a great old deco building,

92
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:25,829
and I'm actually
working right now.

93
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:29,752
Yes, it's as a barista at the coffee mill
on hyperion, but it's a job.

94
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:32,033
And FYI.,
I'm dating the manager.

95
00:04:32,101 --> 00:04:33,535
Her name's Ramona.

96
00:04:33,602 --> 00:04:35,403
She comes from a huge family,

97
00:04:35,471 --> 00:04:38,005
and they all absolutely
love my daughter.

98
00:04:38,347 --> 00:04:41,568
So when are we gonna
meet this Ramona, then?

99
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:49,590
Jenna, honey,
Ramona's waiting.

100
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:52,564
She made us some meatball soup.
You wanna go?

101
00:04:53,941 --> 00:04:56,878
Come on and give me
a big, big, big one.

102
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,364
And a kiss.
I love you.

103
00:05:03,484 --> 00:05:05,059
I love you, too.

104
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:08,210
- You be a good girl, ok?
- I will.

105
00:05:08,596 --> 00:05:10,723
- Ok.
- I will see you soon.

106
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,388
See you soon.

107
00:05:12,936 --> 00:05:14,204
Let's go.

108
00:05:32,295 --> 00:05:33,179
Brandie?

109
00:05:33,996 --> 00:05:36,289
Sorry.
Um, should I...

110
00:05:36,357 --> 00:05:37,934
No, no, no.
It's not a problem.

111
00:05:38,054 --> 00:05:40,100
I was just checkin'
if you're ok.

112
00:05:41,596 --> 00:05:42,939
I'm ok.

113
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:46,429
I just...

114
00:05:47,148 --> 00:05:48,934
I just wish that somehow

115
00:05:49,001 --> 00:05:51,421
we could have worked out
our differences.

116
00:05:53,962 --> 00:05:56,060
She was always
so mad at me.

117
00:05:57,048 --> 00:05:59,332
I mean, we were more
like sisters in a way,

118
00:05:59,452 --> 00:06:01,958
because I had her
when I was so young.

119
00:06:02,642 --> 00:06:04,078
I just didn't...

120
00:06:04,146 --> 00:06:05,754
I didn't have a clue.

121
00:06:07,306 --> 00:06:10,334
And I tried to reach out to her,
but she...

122
00:06:10,605 --> 00:06:14,657
didn't want me to be
a part of her big, fancy life.

123
00:06:17,364 --> 00:06:18,932
Yeah,
you can't let...

124
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,112
the guilt take over.

125
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:24,573
I know it's hard,
but...

126
00:06:26,593 --> 00:06:28,403
this isn't about us.

127
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:30,369
It's about Kimber.

128
00:06:30,489 --> 00:06:32,922
We need to celebrate her
and her life.

129
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,964
Yeah.

130
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,985
You're right.

131
00:06:48,906 --> 00:06:51,230
Tell me what you don't like
about yourself, Mrs...

132
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,860
Carlton,
Sheila Carlton.

133
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,509
Course,
I call her Shu-Shu,

134
00:06:55,629 --> 00:06:57,584
but that's because I've been
calling her Shu-Shu

135
00:06:57,704 --> 00:06:59,121
since we met
in middle school,

136
00:06:59,241 --> 00:07:01,274
or was it in high school?
I don't even remember.

137
00:07:01,394 --> 00:07:03,268
It seems like the years
have flown by,

138
00:07:03,388 --> 00:07:05,321
and I keep calling her
Shu-Shu.

139
00:07:06,567 --> 00:07:11,003
Well, it says here that the injuries
to your face were caused by...

140
00:07:11,123 --> 00:07:12,649
me.
It was because of me.

141
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:14,123
That's why she's here,

142
00:07:14,243 --> 00:07:15,833
because I almost
killed her.

143
00:07:15,901 --> 00:07:18,762
It wasn't your fault, Jane.
Stop blaming yourself.

144
00:07:20,517 --> 00:07:21,869
It was Wayne.

145
00:07:21,989 --> 00:07:23,572
He's the one
who did this to me.

146
00:07:23,692 --> 00:07:25,074
He's an animal.

147
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:35,997
Uh, I'm sorry.
Wayne is your husband?

148
00:07:36,117 --> 00:07:37,376
Her monkey.

149
00:07:38,928 --> 00:07:40,330
Chimpanzee.

150
00:07:41,248 --> 00:07:43,428
He weighed over
200 pounds.

151
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,748
He had a big appetite.

152
00:07:48,002 --> 00:07:50,775
Well, I'm gonna have to do
a complete workup

153
00:07:50,895 --> 00:07:54,520
and talk to the surgeons who
treated you after the attack,

154
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,551
but I would recommend
that you do

155
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,794
the reconstructive surgeries
in stages.

156
00:07:58,777 --> 00:08:01,161
Your body's already been
through enough trauma.

157
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:02,767
And it's my fault.

158
00:08:03,864 --> 00:08:05,929
Can you imagine
being the one

159
00:08:06,049 --> 00:08:08,540
to cause your oldest friend
such agony?

160
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,540
Reminds me of that
awful tragedy with Travis

161
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,215
in Connecticut
a few years back.

162
00:08:13,283 --> 00:08:14,416
Jane, please.

163
00:08:14,484 --> 00:08:16,474
I shouldn't have let him
out of his cage.

164
00:08:16,594 --> 00:08:18,447
He seemed unsettled
that morning,

165
00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:20,087
and I...
I should have just...

166
00:08:20,207 --> 00:08:21,891
you saved my life, Jane.

167
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:23,144
Now stop it.

168
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,098
How did you?

169
00:08:30,557 --> 00:08:32,543
I hit him with a frying pan.

170
00:08:35,872 --> 00:08:38,280
And when he wouldn't
release her,

171
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,976
I stabbed him repeatedly

172
00:08:41,402 --> 00:08:43,154
with a kitchen knife.

173
00:08:49,726 --> 00:08:52,480
I don't know how
you can ever forgive me.

174
00:09:00,736 --> 00:09:04,065
Why don't I have a nurse
escort you to the exam room.

175
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:06,640
You can change, and
we can do a thorough exam.

176
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,875
I want you to make her
as beautiful as she was.

177
00:09:08,995 --> 00:09:10,543
I don't care
what it costs.

178
00:09:10,663 --> 00:09:13,289
- Jane, it's never going to be...
- He owes you this.

179
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:16,866
Wayne did some work
in movies, uh,

180
00:09:16,986 --> 00:09:18,722
television shows.

181
00:09:18,842 --> 00:09:20,682
He had such star appeal.

182
00:09:20,802 --> 00:09:22,835
He was such
a little performer.

183
00:09:27,061 --> 00:09:30,763
I never spent a dime of his money.
I was saving it for his old age.

184
00:09:30,883 --> 00:09:33,632
But I'm spending it now,
every cent.

185
00:09:34,534 --> 00:09:37,276
And everything
I have as well, if I have to.

186
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:44,735
Where is she?

187
00:09:45,102 --> 00:09:46,914
- Um, she...
- Les.

188
00:09:47,198 --> 00:09:48,629
Come here, baby.

189
00:09:49,347 --> 00:09:51,133
It's ok.
I'm here now.

190
00:09:51,817 --> 00:09:53,836
I can't believe it's true.

191
00:09:54,904 --> 00:09:57,735
- When'd you hear for sure?
- Last night.

192
00:09:57,855 --> 00:10:00,023
Is that why you didn't
pick me up at the airport?

193
00:10:00,143 --> 00:10:02,212
'Cause that's what we
originally planned.

194
00:10:02,997 --> 00:10:03,957
Les ?

195
00:10:04,253 --> 00:10:06,814
I'm, uh, Christian Troy,
Kimber's husband.

196
00:10:06,934 --> 00:10:08,654
- The plastic surgeon.
- Yes.

197
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,308
My deepest condolences.

198
00:10:10,428 --> 00:10:11,393
Thank you.

199
00:10:11,513 --> 00:10:13,507
Please, uh,
forgive me.

200
00:10:14,241 --> 00:10:16,260
Was that your Maserati
out there?

201
00:10:17,011 --> 00:10:17,812
Yeah.

202
00:10:18,167 --> 00:10:20,984
Wow. For somebody so
concerned about appearances,

203
00:10:21,104 --> 00:10:23,042
to drive a foreign car. Pfft.

204
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,043
Excuse me?

205
00:10:24,111 --> 00:10:25,759
American economy
needs our support.

206
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:26,755
Les, this...

207
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,896
I own the largest domestic
dealership in Wisconsin.

208
00:10:29,016 --> 00:10:30,292
All makes.
Great deals.

209
00:10:30,412 --> 00:10:32,321
You'd be surprised what
your money can buy nowadays.

210
00:10:32,441 --> 00:10:35,074
- We ship anywhere.
- You tryin' to sell me a car?

211
00:10:35,194 --> 00:10:37,879
I don't sell cars.
I make people happy.

212
00:10:38,964 --> 00:10:40,880
Ready to get back to the hotel?

213
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,672
Christian invited us
to stay here.

214
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:44,742
We were talking about
the memorial service...

215
00:10:44,862 --> 00:10:48,131
I... I already booked the room
for a week, remember, on points.

216
00:10:48,251 --> 00:10:50,108
Gotta try that jacuzzi, huh?

217
00:10:50,228 --> 00:10:51,426
You don't wanna see her

218
00:10:51,546 --> 00:10:53,617
before she puts her face
on in the morning anyway.

219
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:55,497
Listen, is there
a bathroom around here?

220
00:10:55,617 --> 00:10:57,884
I had a couple beers on
the plane, and my bladder's...

221
00:10:58,004 --> 00:10:59,303
Just back there.

222
00:11:02,687 --> 00:11:04,990
Charming. So how long
you guys been together?

223
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,140
6 years.

224
00:11:06,407 --> 00:11:08,302
We break up.
We get back together.

225
00:11:08,422 --> 00:11:09,938
We break up again.

226
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:13,289
He can be a lot to handle,
but I love him.

227
00:11:13,691 --> 00:11:15,444
We have a connection.

228
00:11:17,338 --> 00:11:18,740
Well, Kimber and I,

229
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:22,494
we sure had our fair share
of ups and downs, you know.

230
00:11:22,861 --> 00:11:25,697
I understand exactly
what you're talking about.

231
00:11:25,964 --> 00:11:28,317
I guess it runs
in the family, then.

232
00:11:30,729 --> 00:11:33,596
That is such great soap
you got in there. I love it.

233
00:11:33,716 --> 00:11:34,734
You ready?

234
00:11:36,076 --> 00:11:37,652
We'll call you, ok?

235
00:11:37,772 --> 00:11:41,741
And don't forget to tell me
where you got that soap. Love it.

236
00:11:47,326 --> 00:11:48,919
<i>I am so sorry to hear that.</i>

237
00:11:48,987 --> 00:11:51,643
Yeah, they were married
about a year ago.

238
00:11:52,677 --> 00:11:54,744
Christian's taking it
pretty hard.

239
00:11:54,864 --> 00:11:57,572
Well, well, please,
give him my condolences.

240
00:11:57,857 --> 00:12:01,085
I just can't imagine what
it would be like to lose Sarah.

241
00:12:01,205 --> 00:12:03,558
And suicide, jeez.

242
00:12:03,925 --> 00:12:05,521
That's difficult.

243
00:12:06,355 --> 00:12:08,753
I guess you just...
you can't ever know

244
00:12:08,873 --> 00:12:12,693
what's goin' on in someone's head,
even if you're married to 'em. Right?

245
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:15,832
I think, in a way,
we all feel responsible.

246
00:12:15,952 --> 00:12:17,638
Aw, how can you not?

247
00:12:19,324 --> 00:12:20,450
You know,

248
00:12:21,635 --> 00:12:23,346
it's probably not
the best time for you

249
00:12:23,413 --> 00:12:25,132
to be joining me
in Africa, right?

250
00:12:25,252 --> 00:12:27,263
Probably not, Curtis.
I'm sorry.

251
00:12:27,383 --> 00:12:28,842
Ah, I understand.

252
00:12:28,962 --> 00:12:30,431
Life gets
in the way sometimes.

253
00:12:30,551 --> 00:12:32,382
You know,
we all have responsibilities.

254
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:35,106
And you can't leave
Christian right now.

255
00:12:38,362 --> 00:12:41,570
You get back from this
trip in, what, 3 weeks?

256
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,504
Tell me about the next trip
after that.

257
00:12:43,624 --> 00:12:46,766
Well, we'll be, uh, building
a new hospital in Basra this spring.

258
00:12:46,886 --> 00:12:48,312
- I'm in.
- What?

259
00:12:48,432 --> 00:12:49,607
I've heard that before,
you know.

260
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:52,822
No, no, no.
It's firm this time. I am in.

261
00:12:52,942 --> 00:12:55,559
I'll get the ball rolling
while you're in Africa.

262
00:12:55,627 --> 00:12:58,121
I won't let this be
another Harvard.

263
00:12:59,665 --> 00:13:00,624
Cheers.

264
00:13:01,351 --> 00:13:03,621
I'll hold you
to this one, buddy.

265
00:13:11,266 --> 00:13:13,273
Your blood pressure's
on the high side.

266
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:15,302
Are you under
a lot of stress lately?

267
00:13:15,422 --> 00:13:16,703
You could say that.

268
00:13:16,823 --> 00:13:18,256
You need to control it.

269
00:13:18,376 --> 00:13:20,192
Iraq isn't really relaxing.

270
00:13:20,312 --> 00:13:22,081
It's beautiful, yes, but...

271
00:13:22,695 --> 00:13:24,929
their work there
is really intense.

272
00:13:25,049 --> 00:13:27,420
I think it's gonna be
very good for me, actually.

273
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,366
It's exactly the kind of change
I need in my life right now.

274
00:13:30,486 --> 00:13:32,944
Well, you couldn't have picked
a better organization to work with,

275
00:13:33,064 --> 00:13:34,263
help change your life.

276
00:13:34,383 --> 00:13:36,316
The savior center is
a great place to work.

277
00:13:36,436 --> 00:13:38,254
Curtis often says it saves us
who work here

278
00:13:38,374 --> 00:13:40,187
at least as much
as it saves our patients.

279
00:13:40,307 --> 00:13:42,206
It's so nice to meet you,
Dr. McNamara.

280
00:13:42,326 --> 00:13:45,059
I've heard so many good things.
Thank you, Mallory.

281
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:47,331
Dr. Kwinda.
I'm sorry to say

282
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:48,981
I haven't heard
as much about you.

283
00:13:49,101 --> 00:13:50,266
That's just as well.

284
00:13:50,386 --> 00:13:51,801
We keep very busy
around here.

285
00:13:51,921 --> 00:13:54,422
Eyes on the prize,
so to speak.

286
00:13:56,909 --> 00:13:59,615
Are you gonna be helping
build the hospital in Basra?

287
00:13:59,735 --> 00:14:02,662
I'm afraid not. I'll be here
in San Diego with Nsolo,

288
00:14:02,782 --> 00:14:05,659
spending most of my time
fundraising, unfortunately.

289
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:07,512
Breathe deep, please.

290
00:14:16,633 --> 00:14:18,803
Heart rate's a little elevated.

291
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:22,190
But we'll chalk that up
to the excitement of a new job.

292
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,897
We're all excited about it,
frankly.

293
00:14:25,017 --> 00:14:28,904
You'll be our first reconstructive
surgeon on staff, Dr. McNamara.

294
00:14:29,522 --> 00:14:31,706
Often our patients
with deformities

295
00:14:31,826 --> 00:14:35,118
are ostracized from their villages
and their communities.

296
00:14:35,238 --> 00:14:38,325
Your work will give them
a chance at normalcy again.

297
00:14:40,454 --> 00:14:42,404
Would you like
your prostate examined?

298
00:14:42,524 --> 00:14:43,525
Excuse me?

299
00:14:43,909 --> 00:14:46,705
You're 45.
You need to check it every year.

300
00:14:46,825 --> 00:14:48,051
Better safe than sorry.

301
00:14:48,171 --> 00:14:49,725
Oh, no, no, no.
That's all right.

302
00:14:49,845 --> 00:14:52,062
We should at least be
on a first-name basis before we...

303
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,283
I know yours, Sean.

304
00:14:53,403 --> 00:14:55,950
I'm surprised my husband
didn't at least tell you mine.

305
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,563
Oh, you're married to Nsolo.

306
00:14:58,683 --> 00:14:59,437
No.

307
00:14:59,994 --> 00:15:01,820
Curtis is my husband.

308
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,086
I'm Sarah.

309
00:15:14,661 --> 00:15:16,465
Am I disturbing you?

310
00:15:17,064 --> 00:15:18,667
Not at all.

311
00:15:18,735 --> 00:15:21,325
What are you doing
in this neck of the woods?

312
00:15:21,445 --> 00:15:24,453
Well, Les took me shopping
at neiman Marcus,

313
00:15:24,573 --> 00:15:26,946
and he bought me
a dress for the memorial,

314
00:15:27,066 --> 00:15:29,414
and I was wondering
if you would take a look at it

315
00:15:29,534 --> 00:15:32,068
to see if you think
Kimber would approve.

316
00:15:34,588 --> 00:15:37,125
Wow. That Les, he's got
an eye, doesn't he?

317
00:15:37,245 --> 00:15:39,416
Managed to pick
the one dress in the world

318
00:15:39,536 --> 00:15:41,750
that would make you
look like a whore.

319
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,702
That's not very nice.

320
00:15:43,822 --> 00:15:45,968
I'm sorry,
but the guy's a tool,

321
00:15:46,088 --> 00:15:48,448
and I don't like the way
he talks to you.

322
00:15:48,983 --> 00:15:51,444
He takes care of me,
you know, Christian.

323
00:15:51,564 --> 00:15:54,490
I thought women liked
a little class. Kimber did.

324
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,822
Well, I'm not Kimber.

325
00:15:56,942 --> 00:15:59,861
And Kimber was a star
even before she became one.

326
00:15:59,981 --> 00:16:02,251
I'm just a midwestern nobody.

327
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,662
What am I gonna do?

328
00:16:05,782 --> 00:16:08,283
I really wanted to make
my baby girl proud.

329
00:16:11,063 --> 00:16:12,565
I have an idea.

330
00:16:13,518 --> 00:16:15,678
I have this laser machine
that, uh,

331
00:16:15,746 --> 00:16:18,695
tightens the skin
through soft-cell coagulation,

332
00:16:18,815 --> 00:16:20,740
and there's absolutely
no healing time.

333
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,293
It's like a high-tech facial.

334
00:16:22,413 --> 00:16:23,939
I'd like to talk to Les first.

335
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:25,415
Oh, no, no, no.
Trust me.

336
00:16:25,535 --> 00:16:28,169
It's exactly what Kimmy
would want you to do.

337
00:16:28,569 --> 00:16:30,222
- Really?
- Yes.

338
00:16:35,668 --> 00:16:37,370
Is this gonna hurt?

339
00:16:38,804 --> 00:16:41,508
I told you. It's like, uh...
it's like getting a facial.

340
00:16:41,628 --> 00:16:43,299
I've never had a facial.

341
00:16:43,367 --> 00:16:45,861
Never could afford one.

342
00:16:47,036 --> 00:16:48,511
Sad, right?

343
00:16:51,549 --> 00:16:54,708
So Les always tells me
that my skin is dry.

344
00:16:54,776 --> 00:16:56,676
Is this gonna
help with that?

345
00:16:57,119 --> 00:16:58,204
It should.

346
00:16:58,324 --> 00:16:59,851
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

347
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:03,390
Ok, take a look
over here for me.

348
00:17:06,268 --> 00:17:08,936
Oh, I'm sorry.
Just a sec.

349
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:14,341
I, uh, forgot...

350
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:24,627
I'm sorry I was never
good enough for you either.

351
00:17:30,395 --> 00:17:31,981
Something wrong?

352
00:17:34,868 --> 00:17:35,697
Yeah.

353
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:37,746
It's me.

354
00:17:40,183 --> 00:17:42,392
You don't need this,
Brandie.

355
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:49,936
You look beautiful
just the way you are.

356
00:17:56,261 --> 00:17:59,673
Wow. Les doesn't say
that to me anymore.

357
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:02,598
I haven't heard that
in a long time.

358
00:18:02,992 --> 00:18:05,879
I missed it.
Thank you.

359
00:18:28,577 --> 00:18:30,360
How do you get through
something like that

360
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,030
and not suffer posttraumatic stress
for the rest of your life?

361
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,059
What about her friend?

362
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:36,359
Knowing that she was responsible
for something like this.

363
00:18:36,479 --> 00:18:39,328
It's not like she trained it
to be an attack monkey.

364
00:18:39,448 --> 00:18:41,699
It's what she's doing
that counts,

365
00:18:42,407 --> 00:18:44,200
helping her friend
deal with it,

366
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,493
seeing her through
all these surgeries.

367
00:18:46,613 --> 00:18:48,583
Maybe, but she's still
gonna have to find

368
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:51,705
a way to live with
the guilt. I don't envy her.

369
00:18:54,483 --> 00:18:55,623
That's great.

370
00:18:56,031 --> 00:18:56,808
Yes.

371
00:18:57,792 --> 00:19:00,313
Here he is.
It's Curtis.

372
00:19:00,381 --> 00:19:02,708
Yes, of course I will.
You, too, darling.

373
00:19:02,828 --> 00:19:04,548
I'll talk to you tomorrow. 

374
00:19:05,093 --> 00:19:06,762
Curtis sends his regards.

375
00:19:06,882 --> 00:19:08,361
What are you doing here,
Dr. Kwinda?

376
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,939
I gave a talk at USC med,
and I thought that

377
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:13,536
rather than face the horrible
traffic back to San Diego,

378
00:19:13,656 --> 00:19:15,842
I'd see if you were
free for dinner.

379
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:19,477
Sure. I... I guess
I'm available, yeah.

380
00:19:19,597 --> 00:19:20,408
Great.

381
00:19:20,528 --> 00:19:22,884
I'd love to hear your ideas
on facial reconstruction

382
00:19:23,004 --> 00:19:25,231
for patients with
neurofibromatosis.

383
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,278
Hey.

384
00:19:31,346 --> 00:19:32,272
Hey.

385
00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:35,900
How'd you get
in my house?

386
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,076
Cleaning lady.

387
00:19:37,196 --> 00:19:39,015
Just came to grab
Brandie's makeup bag.

388
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:41,986
Guess, uh, she left it
in your bathroom the other day.

389
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:45,494
Is that what you're watchin'?

390
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:48,673
Ok.
Confession time.

391
00:19:49,507 --> 00:19:52,152
Look, I only found out
about Kimber's career

392
00:19:52,272 --> 00:19:53,724
from Brandie recently.

393
00:19:53,844 --> 00:19:56,838
Being somewhat of an aficionado,
I couldn't help myself.

394
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:59,446
So you went snoopin'
through my shit.

395
00:19:59,566 --> 00:20:01,451
I know. I could have
gone on the Internet,

396
00:20:01,571 --> 00:20:03,607
but the hotel
doesn't have wi-fi.

397
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,219
You wanna know
somethin' weird?

398
00:20:06,603 --> 00:20:09,059
Brandie and Kimber
both make that same face

399
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:10,909
when they're
takin' it from behind.

400
00:20:11,029 --> 00:20:12,829
Buddy,
you're talkin' about...

401
00:20:12,949 --> 00:20:14,805
you're talkin'
about my wife.

402
00:20:14,925 --> 00:20:16,736
I... I meant no disrespect.

403
00:20:16,856 --> 00:20:17,828
She gave me a chubby.

404
00:20:17,948 --> 00:20:19,493
That's the ultimate
show of respect, I think.

405
00:20:19,613 --> 00:20:21,379
You're lucky I don't
throw you off the balcony.

406
00:20:21,499 --> 00:20:23,513
Wait. Wait. Wait.
I'm sorry.

407
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:28,141
You gotta admit it's the one thing
these Henry girls are good at.

408
00:20:28,475 --> 00:20:30,744
Figured it'd be a way
for us to bond.

409
00:20:33,014 --> 00:20:34,966
Please get out of my house.

410
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:52,548
Ah. Got it.

411
00:20:52,616 --> 00:20:54,965
You are being
too overprotective.

412
00:20:55,085 --> 00:20:59,331
Now, friends don't let other
friends' wives drive drunk.

413
00:20:59,451 --> 00:21:01,620
I'm not drunk.
I'm just...

414
00:21:01,688 --> 00:21:02,953
relaxed.

415
00:21:03,073 --> 00:21:04,156
Bathroom.

416
00:21:04,607 --> 00:21:05,890
Right back here.

417
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:07,188
This?

418
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:09,760
Yes, right in there,
my dear.

419
00:21:09,828 --> 00:21:10,861
There.

420
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:13,823
Just listing a little
starboard there, Matey.

421
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:16,727
Believe me,
this isn't drunk.

422
00:21:17,161 --> 00:21:21,531
That night in Thailand when
I had my fifth scorpion whiskey,

423
00:21:22,883 --> 00:21:24,952
now, that was drunk.

424
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:33,152
Yeah, the sheets on the bed
are actually fresh,

425
00:21:33,272 --> 00:21:35,880
as of this morning,
so you're in luck.

426
00:21:36,523 --> 00:21:39,418
- And where do you sleep?
- On the couch.

427
00:21:39,538 --> 00:21:40,856
Here.
Let me.

428
00:21:40,976 --> 00:21:45,635
I had an easier time bivouacking
on the side of Mount Kilimanjaro.

429
00:21:48,649 --> 00:21:52,330
Towels are in this chest.
Aspirin's in the bathroom.

430
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,443
The water in the
kitchen is filtered.

431
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,163
- I don't...
- Ah, ah, ah. Stop.

432
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:58,108
I'm gonna go to bed
before you tell me

433
00:21:58,228 --> 00:22:02,576
about the time you boiled
parasitic water from the Ganges.

434
00:22:03,862 --> 00:22:07,345
- Good night, Sarah.
- Good night, Sean.

435
00:22:09,516 --> 00:22:10,834
Sleep tight.

436
00:22:29,102 --> 00:22:32,006
What... what the hell?
Hey. Wha...

437
00:22:33,241 --> 00:22:34,810
Feel me, Sean.

438
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:39,536
That's right.

439
00:22:39,986 --> 00:22:41,999
That's what you do to me.

440
00:22:42,067 --> 00:22:45,468
Don't.
Please, just don't.

441
00:22:46,045 --> 00:22:47,948
I know you want me.

442
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:52,053
The way you looked at me.

443
00:22:57,716 --> 00:23:00,854
And now I have
tangible proof in my hand.

444
00:23:01,488 --> 00:23:03,027
I can't, Sarah.

445
00:23:03,528 --> 00:23:06,431
I mean it.
I can't.

446
00:23:08,566 --> 00:23:10,102
What about Curtis?

447
00:23:10,469 --> 00:23:12,791
I love Curtis,
but...

448
00:23:12,911 --> 00:23:15,125
these long separations
in our marriage

449
00:23:15,245 --> 00:23:17,195
have forced me
to be more...

450
00:23:18,952 --> 00:23:20,521
Polyamorous.

451
00:23:21,188 --> 00:23:23,973
You have an arrangement or
open marriage or something?

452
00:23:24,093 --> 00:23:28,263
No. I mean I have no idea
what Curtis does when he is away.

453
00:23:28,383 --> 00:23:31,665
I can only assume that since
our sexual encounters are at best...

454
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:35,395
sporadic, he finds some
other way of satisfying his needs.

455
00:23:36,046 --> 00:23:37,986
Don't ask.
Don't tell.

456
00:23:38,994 --> 00:23:40,266
He won't ask,

457
00:23:41,256 --> 00:23:42,853
and I'll never tell.

458
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:48,062
Sarah,

459
00:23:50,699 --> 00:23:54,039
you are a beautiful woman,
and I am attracted to you,

460
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,112
but I can't do this to Curtis.

461
00:24:02,296 --> 00:24:05,374
I never expected you
to be such a boy scout.

462
00:24:05,667 --> 00:24:07,816
I'm... I'm not.

463
00:24:09,103 --> 00:24:11,561
It's just that I've been there,
I've done that before,

464
00:24:11,681 --> 00:24:13,792
slept with my best friend's wife,
and believe me,

465
00:24:13,912 --> 00:24:16,696
no amount of pleasure
can make up for the guilt.

466
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:41,794
She's gonna be fine,
you know.

467
00:24:42,795 --> 00:24:45,363
I managed to reconstruct
the floor of the orbit,

468
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:46,983
the orbital rim,

469
00:24:47,103 --> 00:24:49,607
rebuild her ear,
nasal cavity.

470
00:24:49,675 --> 00:24:51,552
There's gonna be
some swelling,

471
00:24:51,672 --> 00:24:53,835
but we can deal
with that later.

472
00:24:53,955 --> 00:24:56,278
I keep seeing it
over and over.

473
00:24:57,246 --> 00:25:00,100
Give me something
to help me sleep, please.

474
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:02,987
I can if you want,
but...

475
00:25:03,888 --> 00:25:06,242
you might wanna
talk to someone.

476
00:25:07,827 --> 00:25:10,094
Your friend has forgiven you.

477
00:25:10,214 --> 00:25:12,261
Might be time
to forgive yourself.

478
00:25:12,381 --> 00:25:13,650
How can I?

479
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:16,517
Every time I try to sleep,
I see it...

480
00:25:17,878 --> 00:25:20,782
The knife plunging
into his back

481
00:25:20,902 --> 00:25:23,120
and the eyes
staring at me,

482
00:25:23,637 --> 00:25:25,422
pleading with me,

483
00:25:25,542 --> 00:25:28,785
"Why, mommy?
Why are you hurting me?"

484
00:25:33,034 --> 00:25:34,786
Did you know

485
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:38,775
that 98% of their DNA
is the same as ours?

486
00:25:40,781 --> 00:25:44,620
They can give us blood
transfusions and vice versa.

487
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,891
He would comb my hair
ever so gently,

488
00:25:51,443 --> 00:25:54,158
and he'd make
these little Clay statues

489
00:25:54,278 --> 00:25:56,463
while he sat
in front of the tv,

490
00:25:56,967 --> 00:25:58,603
so expressive.

491
00:25:59,382 --> 00:26:02,002
I could see God
in those statues.

492
00:26:03,972 --> 00:26:07,154
I couldn't have loved him
more if he'd been my own.

493
00:26:11,577 --> 00:26:13,663
Sheila never approved.

494
00:26:14,982 --> 00:26:17,103
He could sense that.

495
00:26:19,089 --> 00:26:21,142
Maybe she was afraid.

496
00:26:21,876 --> 00:26:23,622
In light of what happened,

497
00:26:23,742 --> 00:26:25,822
her instincts proved
to be correct.

498
00:26:25,942 --> 00:26:27,802
She didn't respect him.

499
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,322
She should have known
showing up

500
00:26:30,442 --> 00:26:33,129
in that new garish makeup
would disorient him.

501
00:26:34,547 --> 00:26:36,657
And teasing him
with that toy?

502
00:26:37,289 --> 00:26:39,591
You don't torment
an innocent animal.

503
00:26:39,711 --> 00:26:40,755
Innocent?

504
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:42,735
He practically ripped
her face off.

505
00:26:42,855 --> 00:26:43,956
He couldn't help it.

506
00:26:44,076 --> 00:26:45,660
He didn't know
what he was doing.

507
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,379
She was the one
who was a grown-up.

508
00:26:47,499 --> 00:26:49,465
She should have
acted like one.

509
00:26:51,732 --> 00:26:54,052
But it was my fault,

510
00:26:55,204 --> 00:26:57,175
and I told him that.

511
00:26:59,611 --> 00:27:02,016
After they shot him
and he just...

512
00:27:02,136 --> 00:27:04,269
lay there in all that blood,

513
00:27:06,121 --> 00:27:08,208
I told him I was sorry,

514
00:27:08,328 --> 00:27:10,596
he was still my good boy,

515
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,947
and I would love him forever.

516
00:27:20,813 --> 00:27:23,430
Someday, maybe
she'll forgive me.

517
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:26,232
I don't know,
and frankly who cares?

518
00:27:28,218 --> 00:27:30,922
I'll never be able
to forgive myself.

519
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:40,719
Hey,
I was lookin' for you.

520
00:27:42,237 --> 00:27:43,598
Everything ok?

521
00:27:44,832 --> 00:27:46,531
Yeah. Yeah,
I, um...

522
00:27:47,449 --> 00:27:49,196
I was thinkin' how...

523
00:27:49,913 --> 00:27:53,583
good Kimber looked in
this one black dress she has.

524
00:27:53,893 --> 00:27:54,974
So...

525
00:27:55,725 --> 00:27:57,197
beautiful,
you know.

526
00:27:57,317 --> 00:27:59,712
Big tits,
teeny little waist.

527
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:06,036
I'm such an asshole.

528
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:10,476
She really did love you,
you know.

529
00:28:10,596 --> 00:28:13,363
Yeah, well, that was probably
her biggest mistake.

530
00:28:17,451 --> 00:28:18,461
Listen,

531
00:28:19,045 --> 00:28:21,532
there's something that, uh,

532
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,936
- I need to tell you.
- Shoot.

533
00:28:27,222 --> 00:28:29,325
I need to take some time off.

534
00:28:31,161 --> 00:28:33,047
I mean,
maybe we both do.

535
00:28:33,167 --> 00:28:35,639
Maybe we should just shut down
the business for a little while

536
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:37,275
and take a vacation.

537
00:28:39,886 --> 00:28:41,238
Where would we go?

538
00:28:41,672 --> 00:28:43,445
Well,
I think we should...

539
00:28:43,565 --> 00:28:45,547
go our separate ways

540
00:28:45,667 --> 00:28:46,928
for a little while.

541
00:28:47,048 --> 00:28:50,019
I mean, you and I have
been together for...

542
00:28:50,139 --> 00:28:53,291
20 years
practically nonstop.

543
00:29:02,923 --> 00:29:05,143
You're gonna
work with Curtis.

544
00:29:06,527 --> 00:29:07,528
Yeah.

545
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,690
Yeah, I am.

546
00:29:10,247 --> 00:29:12,500
I'm gonna help the savior
center build a hospital.

547
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,205
That's what I wanna do.

548
00:29:14,784 --> 00:29:18,355
I don't wanna let another
opportunity like this pass me by.

549
00:29:19,473 --> 00:29:20,875
Then go.

550
00:29:23,058 --> 00:29:24,772
But you go for a month,

551
00:29:25,523 --> 00:29:27,161
you go forever.

552
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:51,453
Come on. Heh.
Does it fit?

553
00:29:51,804 --> 00:29:55,544
Heh. Well, you flatter me
with a size 2, Christian.

554
00:29:56,779 --> 00:29:58,515
Yeah, it fits.

555
00:30:00,066 --> 00:30:01,940
Oh, yeah.
It's perfect.

556
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:05,978
Did you buy this on rodeo?

557
00:30:09,984 --> 00:30:10,985
Here.

558
00:30:13,192 --> 00:30:14,390
Try this.

559
00:30:16,947 --> 00:30:18,574
It's beautiful.

560
00:30:18,641 --> 00:30:19,744
Wanna try it on?

561
00:30:19,864 --> 00:30:22,295
Yeah.
Of course.

562
00:30:25,383 --> 00:30:26,518
May I?

563
00:30:39,612 --> 00:30:40,880
What do you think?

564
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,572
I think you look just
as amazing as she did.

565
00:30:47,769 --> 00:30:49,755
Did I do something wrong?

566
00:30:50,806 --> 00:30:52,126
I don't know.

567
00:30:54,195 --> 00:30:55,704
I'm sorry.
I just...

568
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,738
We can go shopping
for a new dress.

569
00:31:00,858 --> 00:31:03,072
I don't know what
I was thinking. I just...

570
00:31:03,192 --> 00:31:05,283
No, no, no, no, no.
It's good. It's good.

571
00:31:05,403 --> 00:31:06,726
It's all good.

572
00:31:06,846 --> 00:31:09,715
You've been so good
to me, really. Really.

573
00:31:09,835 --> 00:31:11,405
I can't thank you enough.

574
00:31:11,472 --> 00:31:14,450
It's just a little strange,
but it's good.

575
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:20,625
Just having you here's been
a great comfort for me, so...

576
00:31:24,311 --> 00:31:26,438
She loved you very much.

577
00:31:27,789 --> 00:31:30,764
Yeah, maybe so, but
something of which I'm not

578
00:31:31,595 --> 00:31:32,910
entirely worthy.

579
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:34,719
No, don't say that.

580
00:31:34,999 --> 00:31:36,451
That's not true.

581
00:32:49,414 --> 00:32:50,710
My mother?

582
00:32:52,511 --> 00:32:53,731
My mother.

583
00:32:54,031 --> 00:32:55,884
She's a lovely woman.

584
00:32:56,499 --> 00:32:58,125
She's lonely.
She...

585
00:32:59,059 --> 00:33:00,491
she lost a daughter.

586
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:02,634
Come on,
Christian.

587
00:33:02,754 --> 00:33:06,125
What kind of woman sleeps
with her daughter's husband?

588
00:33:06,245 --> 00:33:07,570
And really, that...

589
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:09,736
that's even
a new low for you.

590
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:13,420
We were giving each other
comfort in a time of need. It's...

591
00:33:14,055 --> 00:33:16,548
human.
It's normal.

592
00:33:26,678 --> 00:33:28,628
Well, it's a good thing
I'm dead

593
00:33:28,748 --> 00:33:31,151
so this isn't the final
knife in my heart.

594
00:33:31,768 --> 00:33:33,824
Everything's a knife
in your heart.

595
00:33:33,944 --> 00:33:35,971
So what are you gonna
do now, Christian?

596
00:33:36,091 --> 00:33:37,907
You gonna take care of her?

597
00:33:38,027 --> 00:33:40,931
I mean, give me a break.
You don't care about my mother.

598
00:33:41,051 --> 00:33:43,582
You're just using her
like you do everybody.

599
00:33:44,129 --> 00:33:47,414
I am who I am, all right?
You don't have a say in it.

600
00:33:47,534 --> 00:33:50,249
- You killed yourself.
- You destroyed me.

601
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:16,005
What is it?

602
00:34:28,049 --> 00:34:29,718
I really miss her.

603
00:34:35,844 --> 00:34:37,346
I know.

604
00:34:52,529 --> 00:34:54,001
Dr. McNamara.

605
00:34:54,121 --> 00:34:55,687
Nsolo.
How are you?

606
00:34:55,807 --> 00:34:57,876
Good.
What are you doing here?

607
00:34:57,996 --> 00:35:00,023
Well, I know we don't
leave for a few weeks,

608
00:35:00,143 --> 00:35:02,474
but since it's a Saturday,
I thought I'd come down and

609
00:35:02,594 --> 00:35:03,767
volunteer for the day.

610
00:35:03,887 --> 00:35:05,516
We can always use
an extra hand.

611
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:07,958
We're helping the W.H.O.
with an airdrop into Kenya

612
00:35:08,078 --> 00:35:11,164
on Thursday to help the people
who suffered from the flooding.

613
00:35:11,284 --> 00:35:13,600
We have over 1,100 units
still to pack.

614
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,089
Show me where.

615
00:35:18,427 --> 00:35:19,695
Curtis.

616
00:35:20,864 --> 00:35:22,428
I'll catch up with you.

617
00:35:22,862 --> 00:35:24,862
I didn't think
you'd be back yet.

618
00:35:24,982 --> 00:35:27,425
Ah, something more pressing
came up here.

619
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:29,044
Can I help?

620
00:35:29,745 --> 00:35:31,992
I've already told Christian,
so...

621
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,791
I'm officially yours
in a couple weeks.

622
00:35:35,319 --> 00:35:37,033
You know,
you and Christian,

623
00:35:37,153 --> 00:35:39,533
you guys are a lot more
alike than I ever thought.

624
00:35:39,653 --> 00:35:42,149
I mean, you come in here
all eager like a puppy, and then

625
00:35:42,269 --> 00:35:43,732
you piss all over
the carpet.

626
00:35:44,189 --> 00:35:46,168
Curtis, what's going on?
I don't...

627
00:35:46,288 --> 00:35:48,272
Sarah told me,
you asshole.

628
00:35:48,672 --> 00:35:50,240
And when I got the call,

629
00:35:50,308 --> 00:35:52,452
I was holding
a 3-month-old little girl

630
00:35:52,572 --> 00:35:54,476
severely malnourished,

631
00:35:54,596 --> 00:35:56,428
chances of survival
practically nil.

632
00:35:56,548 --> 00:35:59,255
Her mother died of aids
20 minutes earlier than that.

633
00:35:59,375 --> 00:36:01,987
You know, one less doctor there
means many less lives saved,

634
00:36:02,107 --> 00:36:03,934
but I came home
to save my marriage.

635
00:36:04,054 --> 00:36:06,982
Curtis, I don't know what
she said, but nothing...

636
00:36:07,102 --> 00:36:09,735
I mean...
Nothing happened.

637
00:36:09,855 --> 00:36:11,112
Don't believe you.

638
00:36:11,232 --> 00:36:13,101
No, I mean,
we went to dinner.

639
00:36:13,535 --> 00:36:16,709
She... she got really drunk,
and... we both were,

640
00:36:16,829 --> 00:36:19,206
but we both went
right to sleep.

641
00:36:19,326 --> 00:36:21,004
Nothing...
nothing happened.

642
00:36:21,072 --> 00:36:22,738
Nothing.

643
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:25,314
I wouldn't do that to you.
I wouldn't do that to us.

644
00:36:25,434 --> 00:36:30,327
Why would my wife lie about screwing
an old friend from college?!

645
00:36:30,447 --> 00:36:33,172
I have no idea, but you...
you gotta believe me.

646
00:36:33,292 --> 00:36:34,281
No, I don't.

647
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:36,722
And as executive director,
it's gonna be impossible for you

648
00:36:36,842 --> 00:36:39,459
to work at the savior center or
any of its affiliate missions,

649
00:36:39,579 --> 00:36:42,430
so just get out of here, ok?
Go back to Christian.

650
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:43,800
You two...

651
00:36:44,818 --> 00:36:47,235
you two are obviously
meant to be together.

652
00:36:47,355 --> 00:36:49,174
Curtis, you gotta let...

653
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:53,311
Ok.

654
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:55,731
Here we go.

655
00:36:56,315 --> 00:36:58,841
Dr. McNamara
is gonna be in today,

656
00:36:58,961 --> 00:37:01,895
and then we can schedule
your follow-ups,

657
00:37:02,479 --> 00:37:03,173
ok?

658
00:37:03,794 --> 00:37:04,812
May I?

659
00:37:05,663 --> 00:37:07,933
Oh, absolutely you may.

660
00:37:09,252 --> 00:37:11,028
You know that Jane

661
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,583
has paid all your bills.
You know that.

662
00:37:20,439 --> 00:37:23,260
You know, a lot of the
swelling has not gone down,

663
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:26,535
and when it does, we will
then know how to proceed.

664
00:37:31,992 --> 00:37:34,726
It was never going to be
what it was.

665
00:37:34,846 --> 00:37:36,887
He told me that.

666
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:40,977
But still,
we hope.

667
00:37:41,872 --> 00:37:44,298
I suppose I should
take some comfort

668
00:37:44,418 --> 00:37:46,458
in becoming a poster child.

669
00:37:46,578 --> 00:37:49,009
If anyone had any doubts
about the state passing

670
00:37:49,129 --> 00:37:52,520
that ordinance requiring owners
to cage their exotic pets,

671
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,557
they only have
to look at me.

672
00:37:54,625 --> 00:37:55,757
Knock-knock.

673
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,185
Oh, my.
Look at you.

674
00:38:01,189 --> 00:38:03,025
You look beautiful.

675
00:38:03,876 --> 00:38:05,114
Well,

676
00:38:05,955 --> 00:38:08,137
you will look beautiful.

677
00:38:09,375 --> 00:38:13,478
Of course you're still swollen
and bruised, but that's not surprising.

678
00:38:13,598 --> 00:38:15,911
I just knew
they were the best.

679
00:38:16,278 --> 00:38:19,167
I knew we picked
the right doctors to come to.

680
00:38:19,287 --> 00:38:20,891
You know,
I was just telling her

681
00:38:21,011 --> 00:38:22,777
that she's gonna
have to take it easy

682
00:38:22,897 --> 00:38:24,559
when you leave
here tomorrow.

683
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:26,460
I'll make sure of that.

684
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,284
I've got the guest room
all made up.

685
00:38:29,404 --> 00:38:33,022
It'll be like staying
at a 5-star resort.

686
00:38:34,508 --> 00:38:36,687
And I've got a surprise.

687
00:38:37,046 --> 00:38:40,838
Oh, dear. That's not
very relaxing, is it?

688
00:38:41,301 --> 00:38:43,425
Something to cheer you up.

689
00:38:44,139 --> 00:38:46,409
There.
That's much better.

690
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,630
Wait'll you meet Gunther.

691
00:38:48,698 --> 00:38:50,899
He's hilarious.

692
00:38:51,325 --> 00:38:52,635
Your favorite.

693
00:38:52,702 --> 00:38:55,214
A little comedian in fur.

694
00:38:59,903 --> 00:39:01,085
Gunther?

695
00:39:01,984 --> 00:39:03,585
Jesus, Jane, you didn't.

696
00:39:03,653 --> 00:39:05,146
He's just a baby,
Shu-Shu.

697
00:39:05,266 --> 00:39:06,562
He's nothing like Wayne.

698
00:39:06,682 --> 00:39:09,211
He's just the most adorable
thing you ever saw.

699
00:39:09,331 --> 00:39:11,421
He's already using
a fork and knife.

700
00:39:11,541 --> 00:39:13,090
You got another monkey?

701
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:14,491
Chimp.

702
00:39:14,611 --> 00:39:15,643
Look at me.

703
00:39:16,674 --> 00:39:17,830
Look at me!

704
00:39:18,871 --> 00:39:21,598
Look at what that
animal did to me!

705
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:24,065
Look at what you did to me.

706
00:39:24,185 --> 00:39:25,005
Shu-shu...

707
00:39:25,125 --> 00:39:27,034
you get rid of that ape, Jane.

708
00:39:27,301 --> 00:39:29,972
Stop showering all your
affection on these animals.

709
00:39:30,092 --> 00:39:31,559
That's why
you can't find love.

710
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:33,778
There's no room
for anything human.

711
00:39:36,754 --> 00:39:39,955
If you value our friendship,

712
00:39:40,075 --> 00:39:42,392
 the 30 years we've
known each other,

713
00:39:42,512 --> 00:39:44,280
you have to choose

714
00:39:46,107 --> 00:39:48,660
the monkey or me.

715
00:39:52,136 --> 00:39:55,558
That monkey loved me
unconditionally.

716
00:39:55,891 --> 00:39:57,591
He never judged me,

717
00:39:57,711 --> 00:40:01,236
and he forgave me, even when
I took his life to save yours.

718
00:40:04,048 --> 00:40:06,601
You think your heart will
ever be that big?

719
00:40:20,771 --> 00:40:22,373
- Hey.
- Hey.

720
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,308
You mind if
I have one of those?

721
00:40:25,428 --> 00:40:26,338
Sure.

722
00:40:32,743 --> 00:40:34,078
Where's Brandie?

723
00:40:36,698 --> 00:40:40,108
Wisconsin.
It's for the best.

724
00:40:41,132 --> 00:40:43,448
She reminded me
too much of Kimber.

725
00:40:44,821 --> 00:40:48,126
Aren't you supposed to be getting
dysentery shots or something?

726
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:54,968
I'm not going to Africa.

727
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,677
Where's Saint Curtis
taking you?

728
00:41:00,797 --> 00:41:01,865
Nowhere.

729
00:41:04,335 --> 00:41:06,822
Turns out he's kind
of an asshole.

730
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:12,574
Well, you never were
too good at picking partners.

731
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,876
He accused me
of sleeping with his wife.

732
00:41:15,996 --> 00:41:17,265
- Did you?
- No.

733
00:41:17,882 --> 00:41:20,269
Well, that's good, because
sleeping with your friend's wife

734
00:41:20,389 --> 00:41:22,456
is very tough on
the relationship.

735
00:41:32,387 --> 00:41:33,639
I'm stayin'.

736
00:41:35,608 --> 00:41:36,860
That's good.

737
00:41:41,295 --> 00:41:43,448
Thinkin' 'bout sellin'
this place,

738
00:41:44,263 --> 00:41:46,613
gettin' a place up
in the hills, you know,

739
00:41:46,733 --> 00:41:48,382
view of the city lights or...

740
00:41:48,502 --> 00:41:50,454
Well, you can't beat
this view.

741
00:41:55,607 --> 00:41:56,846
I used to love it,

742
00:41:56,966 --> 00:41:59,549
but now it's just like
looking at a graveyard.

743
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:03,304
It'll pass.

744
00:42:11,587 --> 00:42:13,640
It's good to have you back.

745
00:42:17,989 --> 00:42:21,978
