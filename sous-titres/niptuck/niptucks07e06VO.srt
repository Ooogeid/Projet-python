1
00:00:00,093 --> 00:00:02,008
Hey, do you still
need that loan?

2
00:00:02,128 --> 00:00:04,171
I'm late, what,
two payments?

3
00:00:04,291 --> 00:00:06,215
I always wanted
to screw the I.R.S.

4
00:00:06,335 --> 00:00:09,603
But that was not
a $457,000 screw.

5
00:00:09,723 --> 00:00:12,165
I will get the money.
Jail is always an option.

6
00:00:12,285 --> 00:00:14,950
I need your signature. I want to
take out a loan against the business.

7
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,717
No, no, no.
No way.

8
00:00:18,981 --> 00:00:20,999
Don't need the loan
anymore, buddy boy.

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,625
I got an extension.

10
00:00:23,715 --> 00:00:25,170
This is really bad.

11
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,114
How come
I don't feel guilty?

12
00:00:27,234 --> 00:00:29,209
We need to stop doing this.

13
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:31,073
You're not going
back to him, are you?

14
00:00:31,193 --> 00:00:33,342
- He's my husband.
- You deserve better.

15
00:00:33,462 --> 00:00:35,302
You won't ever
make me happy.

16
00:00:35,422 --> 00:00:38,368
We've hit a rough patch.
You don't break up because of it.

17
00:00:38,488 --> 00:00:39,761
He's done with me now.

18
00:00:39,881 --> 00:00:41,907
Good. He's doing you
a favor, Kimber.

19
00:00:42,027 --> 00:00:43,148
It's a gift.

20
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:50,050
Marcy Hamill flat-lined
in recovery.

21
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,220
Why do the police
have to know?

22
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,678
No way, Christian. We're not
going down that road again.

23
00:00:54,798 --> 00:00:57,105
This time we do it
by the book.

24
00:01:06,256 --> 00:01:09,909
It's not like these are things
that I don't like about you.

25
00:01:10,975 --> 00:01:13,110
It's just that, you know...

26
00:01:14,602 --> 00:01:15,574
I mean,

27
00:01:15,694 --> 00:01:19,076
there comes a point
where the...

28
00:01:19,196 --> 00:01:20,911
the lack of attention,
you know,

29
00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:23,962
doesn't feel like just some
sort of benign neglect.

30
00:01:24,082 --> 00:01:26,781
I mean, I know all about that.
My mother was an expert, trust me.

31
00:01:26,901 --> 00:01:30,131
But it begins
to feel intentional, like he...

32
00:01:31,314 --> 00:01:33,594
Like you want to hurt me.

33
00:01:33,714 --> 00:01:35,672
But we have talked
about this 50 times.

34
00:01:35,792 --> 00:01:38,806
Didn't we have the same
conversation two weeks ago?

35
00:01:40,493 --> 00:01:42,417
For God's sake,
talk, Ron,

36
00:01:42,537 --> 00:01:45,250
because you know that
I'll fill the silences if you don't,

37
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:48,034
and it's usually with
some stupid crap.

38
00:01:48,788 --> 00:01:52,245
And this is exactly what
the doctor and I are talking about.

39
00:01:52,365 --> 00:01:55,678
You need to start
generating this relationship.

40
00:02:00,572 --> 00:02:01,477
Ron?

41
00:02:03,186 --> 00:02:04,259
Anything?

42
00:02:05,533 --> 00:02:06,521
I'm done.

43
00:02:06,907 --> 00:02:09,221
Done talking about this?

44
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,003
Done talking about anything.

45
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,251
What is that?

46
00:02:20,371 --> 00:02:22,831
Divorce papers.
I had Eddie draw them up.

47
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:25,097
I've also separated
our bank accounts and

48
00:02:25,217 --> 00:02:28,044
I'm renting a place down in
the marina for the time being.

49
00:02:28,164 --> 00:02:30,871
Tonya's at our place now,
packing up my things.

50
00:02:35,932 --> 00:02:39,818
Dahlia, this is obviously
very painful to hear.

51
00:02:39,938 --> 00:02:41,748
I think we should, uh,

52
00:02:42,277 --> 00:02:44,430
take this slow.

53
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,275
You asshole...

54
00:02:48,012 --> 00:02:49,998
You goddamned asshole!

55
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:52,395
Damn it!

56
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:59,081
This is why
I did this here!

57
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,481
I knew you couldn't handle it!
She's unstable.

58
00:03:02,601 --> 00:03:04,026
Handle it?!

59
00:03:05,216 --> 00:03:08,551
We have been
married for 20 years!

60
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:12,872
What did you expect me
to do, thank you?!

61
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,095
It's Tonya.

62
00:03:20,732 --> 00:03:23,262
You're screwing
your secretary?

63
00:03:23,632 --> 00:03:25,340
It's not Tonya.

64
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:27,485
It's you.

65
00:03:28,793 --> 00:03:31,069
It's all about you,
Dahlia.

66
00:03:31,189 --> 00:03:35,009
You're passive-aggressive
and cruel and diminishing.

67
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:39,584
But this...
this therapy.

68
00:03:40,134 --> 00:03:43,444
We came here to save
our relationship,

69
00:03:43,564 --> 00:03:45,372
our 20-year marriage.

70
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:47,216
Stop with the 20 years,

71
00:03:47,336 --> 00:03:49,612
as if it's some endurance sport!

72
00:03:49,732 --> 00:03:52,042
Therapy didn't save us,
Dahlia.

73
00:03:52,162 --> 00:03:55,477
It only made me realize
how little there is for me here

74
00:03:55,597 --> 00:03:56,866
with you.

75
00:04:11,698 --> 00:04:12,770
You prick.

76
00:04:13,038 --> 00:04:14,731
I'm gonna take everything.

77
00:04:15,093 --> 00:04:16,783
He has a little dick.

78
00:04:16,903 --> 00:04:19,388
It's about the size of
a goddamned grain of rice.

79
00:04:19,508 --> 00:04:21,690
We're both to blame for this.

80
00:04:22,827 --> 00:04:26,027
- Where are you going?
- Wherever I want.

81
00:04:38,471 --> 00:04:41,822
Dr. Troy, Dr. McNamara,
I'm ready for you now.

87
00:05:29,887 --> 00:05:32,317
So, uh,
what's their story?

88
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,533
I can't really talk
about that.

89
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:37,556
We understand.

90
00:05:37,982 --> 00:05:40,822
We're doctors, too.
Plastic surgeons.

91
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,582
Not like we're
a couple or anything.

92
00:05:43,884 --> 00:05:47,389
My practice specializes in
couple and group therapy.

93
00:05:47,775 --> 00:05:50,333
That can mean
husbands and wives,

94
00:05:50,453 --> 00:05:52,485
lovers,
brothers and sisters,

95
00:05:52,605 --> 00:05:55,200
or people in
a professional relationship.

96
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:58,365
You'd be surprised how many
business partners I see.

97
00:05:59,186 --> 00:06:01,759
So how long have you two
been working together?

98
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:02,915
20 years.

99
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,489
Is that long? I mean,
compared to your other clients?

100
00:06:07,042 --> 00:06:09,675
Why did you decide you
suddenly needed therapy?

101
00:06:10,044 --> 00:06:12,052
You must know
each other very well.

102
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:15,478
Probably become pretty
adept at self-solving.

103
00:06:15,847 --> 00:06:17,506
We've had our fights,

104
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:20,048
just like anybody else,
you know,

105
00:06:20,168 --> 00:06:21,758
but we manage
to work them out.

106
00:06:21,878 --> 00:06:24,698
Frankly, I think we could fix
this with a week in Cabo,

107
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:28,206
but he thinks our money's
better spent, uh, on you.

108
00:06:28,993 --> 00:06:31,429
Now why did you think that,
Dr. McNamara?

109
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,865
Are things the worst
they've ever been?

110
00:06:33,985 --> 00:06:34,687
No.

111
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,620
He was married to
this woman. Her name's Julia.

112
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,212
They had
a son together... Matt.

113
00:06:41,332 --> 00:06:44,195
A few years ago, we found out
that Matt was actually my son,

114
00:06:44,315 --> 00:06:47,410
and he decided to beat the shit
out of me in the scrub room.

115
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:50,798
I think that was the worst.

116
00:06:54,326 --> 00:06:57,871
Usually, when
couples seek therapy,

117
00:06:57,938 --> 00:07:00,484
it's when things
are at their bleakest,

118
00:07:00,604 --> 00:07:02,696
when all hope seems lost.

119
00:07:03,233 --> 00:07:05,879
Is that the way you feel,
Dr. McNamara?

120
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:08,497
Sometimes.

121
00:07:08,617 --> 00:07:09,676
I don't.

122
00:07:10,186 --> 00:07:13,410
I want things to go back to exactly
the way they were before.

123
00:07:13,863 --> 00:07:15,455
I love him.
I miss him.

124
00:07:15,523 --> 00:07:17,290
Do you love Dr. Troy?

125
00:07:18,028 --> 00:07:18,999
I do.

126
00:07:19,886 --> 00:07:22,048
He's like
the brother I never had.

127
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:26,841
Sometimes family
can be very difficult.

128
00:07:27,712 --> 00:07:30,376
When we describe
a friend as a family member,

129
00:07:30,678 --> 00:07:34,178
sometimes we're saying
we love them in spite of themselves,

130
00:07:34,298 --> 00:07:36,635
that we have no choice
but to love them.

131
00:07:37,171 --> 00:07:40,113
Do you feel you have
a choice to love Dr. Troy?

132
00:07:41,454 --> 00:07:42,678
Of course I do.

133
00:07:44,588 --> 00:07:47,040
I want to try
an exercise with you.

134
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:55,427
I want you to draw
your families.

135
00:07:55,547 --> 00:07:58,208
Doesn't have to be
a Degas. Just...

136
00:07:58,328 --> 00:08:00,262
draw whatever you feel.

137
00:08:03,044 --> 00:08:04,100
Thank you.

138
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:16,938
Christian?

139
00:08:19,637 --> 00:08:22,066
That's, uh,
Sean and that's me.

140
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,078
That's it?
Where are your kids?

141
00:08:24,198 --> 00:08:25,860
I don't know.
Sleeping in another room.

142
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,354
Well, that's not your family.

143
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:29,818
Don't judge my picture.
Let's see yours.

144
00:08:33,171 --> 00:08:34,766
Is that you
wife and children?

145
00:08:34,886 --> 00:08:35,688
Yes.

146
00:08:35,808 --> 00:08:37,213
They don't live with you?

147
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:40,253
No, they live with her in New York.
How'd you know that?

148
00:08:40,373 --> 00:08:43,102
Everyone's hands are
touching except yours.

149
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:45,686
You put your ex-wife in your
picture, but you didn't put me in it.

150
00:08:45,806 --> 00:08:47,175
Now you're judging my picture.

151
00:08:47,295 --> 00:08:48,298
I'm just saying.

152
00:08:48,418 --> 00:08:50,784
It is interesting that a few
minutes ago you described

153
00:08:50,904 --> 00:08:52,859
Dr. Troy as your brother,

154
00:08:52,979 --> 00:08:56,167
then you neglected to include him
in your family portrait.

155
00:08:56,287 --> 00:08:58,109
Well,
a few months ago,

156
00:08:58,377 --> 00:09:00,526
I probably would have
included him.

157
00:09:01,354 --> 00:09:02,534
What's happened?

158
00:09:02,654 --> 00:09:05,625
Certainly nothing worse
than discovering he...

159
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,085
fathered your firstborn.

160
00:09:11,816 --> 00:09:15,771
It's nothing big or specific like that.
I just feel worn down by him.

161
00:09:16,358 --> 00:09:19,593
He sucks all the air
out of the room. He's, uh...

162
00:09:20,162 --> 00:09:22,223
How do I put this delicately?

163
00:09:22,575 --> 00:09:24,876
- Christian is not a good person.
- Very delicate.

164
00:09:24,996 --> 00:09:27,607
You know, you have your
moral code, but let's face it.

165
00:09:27,727 --> 00:09:30,273
You're willing to do some pretty horrible
things in the name of self-interest.

166
00:09:30,393 --> 00:09:31,765
You know, if we're talking
about the same things,

167
00:09:31,885 --> 00:09:33,672
then you were right alongside me.
I'm just not ashamed of myself.

168
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,803
All right. I never would have done
those things if you weren't in my life.

169
00:09:36,923 --> 00:09:39,817
We have this joke that our offices
are built over the mouth of hell.

170
00:09:39,937 --> 00:09:41,646
Well, if that's true,
he's the devil.

171
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:44,348
Do you have any idea how boring
your life would be if I wasn't in it?

172
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,951
This is what you do.
You diminish me so that I need you.

173
00:09:47,018 --> 00:09:48,867
Is this why we're giving
this guy 250 an hour, huh?

174
00:09:48,987 --> 00:09:50,153
So you can play the victim?

175
00:09:50,221 --> 00:09:52,160
I mean, seriously, talk about
sucking the life out of somebody.

176
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,434
I mean, how long are you going
to keep blaming me

177
00:09:53,554 --> 00:09:54,890
for how much
you hate your life?

178
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,130
Let's slow down for a sec...

179
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,073
No, no, no.
I don't want to slow down.

180
00:09:57,193 --> 00:09:58,727
I want to know something first.
Why didn't you put me in your picture?

181
00:09:58,795 --> 00:09:59,699
I told you.

182
00:09:59,819 --> 00:10:01,727
No, you didn't tell me.
What happened a few months ago?

183
00:10:01,847 --> 00:10:03,584
Nothing.
That's the point.

184
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:05,830
This relationship never changes.

185
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:08,393
I'm just waking up to the fact
that it doesn't work,

186
00:10:08,513 --> 00:10:10,306
that maybe it never worked.

187
00:10:16,357 --> 00:10:18,558
You guys up
for another exercise?

188
00:10:18,882 --> 00:10:20,873
What is this, pre-school?

189
00:10:20,993 --> 00:10:23,532
You're both highly
intelligent, educated men.

190
00:10:23,652 --> 00:10:25,740
Sometimes I have
to trick people like you.

191
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,421
No, check that.
You have to trick yourselves

192
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:31,703
into getting past
your really good bullshit.

193
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,281
You have 15 seconds.

194
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:38,418
Write down every word you can
think of to describe your partner.

195
00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:41,535
Go.

196
00:10:49,633 --> 00:10:51,024
Ok, time's up.

197
00:10:52,968 --> 00:10:55,432
Dr. McNamara,
this time you go first.

198
00:10:57,008 --> 00:10:59,824
"Tall, arrogant,
peacock,

199
00:10:59,944 --> 00:11:02,874
womanizer, clothes whore,
surgeon,

200
00:11:03,142 --> 00:11:05,975
damaged,
dangerous, asshole."

201
00:11:08,816 --> 00:11:10,978
Dr. Troy,
any thoughts?

202
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:14,952
Uh, hard to argue
with any of those.

203
00:11:16,477 --> 00:11:17,919
What about yours?

204
00:11:25,963 --> 00:11:26,781
What?

205
00:11:26,901 --> 00:11:29,362
You think Dr. McNamara
has a drinking problem?

206
00:11:29,482 --> 00:11:30,670
No, but I think
he's an alcoholic.

207
00:11:30,738 --> 00:11:31,604
What's the difference?

208
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:34,652
The difference is people with drinking
problems can't stop drinking.

209
00:11:34,772 --> 00:11:37,027
You abuse it.
You self-medicate.

210
00:11:37,147 --> 00:11:39,470
When was the last time
you had a drink?

211
00:11:39,851 --> 00:11:41,057
Before he came in here.

212
00:11:41,177 --> 00:11:43,102
I could smell it on his breath
on the way over.

213
00:11:43,222 --> 00:11:45,349
He keeps a bottle of vodka
under his fish tank.

214
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:47,356
Are you accusing me of
drinking before surgery?

215
00:11:47,476 --> 00:11:48,716
No, but after.

216
00:11:53,521 --> 00:11:57,407
We deal in micro-millimeters
over the course of 6 to 8 hours.

217
00:11:57,527 --> 00:12:00,507
It's very hard to let go
after something like that.

218
00:12:00,627 --> 00:12:02,199
Not all surgeons drink.

219
00:12:02,319 --> 00:12:03,808
No.
Some take pills.

220
00:12:03,928 --> 00:12:06,601
Some screw the girls
who water the ficus plant.

221
00:12:07,406 --> 00:12:09,483
You know,
it's not just the drinking.

222
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,472
You behave like
an alcoholic, ok?

223
00:12:11,592 --> 00:12:13,433
You act out and then
you'll apologize,

224
00:12:13,553 --> 00:12:15,973
and you expect everybody
to forgive you.

225
00:12:16,794 --> 00:12:19,842
He doesn't take responsibility
for anything in his life.

226
00:12:19,962 --> 00:12:23,285
Julia is a crazy dyke,
Matt's got my genes,

227
00:12:23,405 --> 00:12:25,764
I'm the devil,
as you just heard.

228
00:12:27,285 --> 00:12:30,229
The one common thread
in all of this...

229
00:12:30,772 --> 00:12:32,261
is you.
- You need me.

230
00:12:32,381 --> 00:12:35,094
No, I don't need you.
I'm a hell of a surgeon myself, ok?

231
00:12:35,214 --> 00:12:38,837
The only reason I'm with him is
because I choose to be with him.

232
00:12:43,412 --> 00:12:44,418
Why?

233
00:12:45,584 --> 00:12:47,720
Sometimes the fastest
way to get to the truth

234
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,915
is to ask the
simplest questions.

235
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,010
Why do you stay together?

236
00:12:53,549 --> 00:12:55,225
Is it money?

237
00:12:55,654 --> 00:12:57,552
Loyalty?
Habit?

238
00:12:57,672 --> 00:12:59,295
No, no, no.
That's not my style.

239
00:12:59,415 --> 00:13:02,010
I know when the party's over
an hour before everybody else does.

240
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,066
Then why?

241
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,737
We're a good team.

242
00:13:06,857 --> 00:13:08,730
Sean's a hell of a surgeon,
you know? I'm...

243
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,423
I'm inspired by him.

244
00:13:11,093 --> 00:13:13,189
Are you inspired
by Dr. Troy?

245
00:13:13,641 --> 00:13:14,770
Not really.

246
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:18,773
You know, sometimes there are
things that I envy about him,

247
00:13:18,893 --> 00:13:20,664
all the women, but...

248
00:13:21,081 --> 00:13:24,114
whenever I try those things,
I see how

249
00:13:24,234 --> 00:13:26,222
empty they are and that
really he's just searching

250
00:13:26,342 --> 00:13:27,680
for something I already have.

251
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,040
And what's that?

252
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,741
Well, a center, a purpose.

253
00:13:32,026 --> 00:13:33,364
And what purpose is that?

254
00:13:33,484 --> 00:13:35,244
Yeah, I want to hear this.

255
00:13:35,646 --> 00:13:38,931
To help people,
to be a doctor, to heal.

256
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,746
That is such bullshit.

257
00:13:41,814 --> 00:13:43,761
He wants the babes
and the booze

258
00:13:43,881 --> 00:13:46,143
just as much,
if not more, than I do.

259
00:13:46,646 --> 00:13:50,130
It is kind of interesting that
you would have that purpose

260
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,281
and yet choose
to be a cosmetic surgeon.

261
00:13:53,401 --> 00:13:55,093
Believe me, I've had
some serious doubts

262
00:13:55,213 --> 00:13:56,532
about that decision lately.

263
00:13:56,652 --> 00:13:58,643
Here we go again. He's been singing
the same tune for the last 20 years.

264
00:13:58,763 --> 00:14:00,746
- Well, maybe this time it's different.
- It isn't.

265
00:14:00,866 --> 00:14:02,084
Now, this is what he does.

266
00:14:02,204 --> 00:14:03,779
He says he accepts me
for who I am,

267
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:06,376
then the second I try to set
some boundaries between us,

268
00:14:06,496 --> 00:14:08,033
he yanks me right back in.

269
00:14:08,153 --> 00:14:10,465
Do you have boundary issues,
Dr. Troy?

270
00:14:10,585 --> 00:14:12,552
When we lived together,
he thought nothing of coming

271
00:14:12,672 --> 00:14:15,013
into my room at any hour just
because he felt like talking.

272
00:14:15,133 --> 00:14:16,790
Is it wrong to want to shoot
the shit with your best friend?

273
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,481
- My door was closed.
- Just answer me. Is it?

274
00:14:18,601 --> 00:14:20,092
You're invading
my private space.

275
00:14:20,212 --> 00:14:22,570
I always check to make sure
he's not jerking off or whatever.

276
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,471
All his homes have
very few walls.

277
00:14:24,591 --> 00:14:26,365
It's like he needs to see you
all the time

278
00:14:26,485 --> 00:14:27,958
to make sure
you're still there.

279
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:30,294
I assume it's because he was
brought up in foster care,

280
00:14:30,414 --> 00:14:31,951
but it's exhausting!

281
00:14:34,876 --> 00:14:37,857
But you must have liked
being needed in that way,

282
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,753
Dr. McNamara.
I mean,

283
00:14:40,156 --> 00:14:44,538
to be in a relationship with
someone so specifically needy.

284
00:14:44,658 --> 00:14:47,353
You keep asking about the
past, but can't people change?

285
00:14:47,473 --> 00:14:49,729
Can't I wake up one day and
realize I don't want to be

286
00:14:49,849 --> 00:14:51,988
that person anymore
and I'm just done?

287
00:14:52,108 --> 00:14:54,502
What do you mean, done?
Aren't we gonna save this?

288
00:14:54,622 --> 00:14:56,079
Well, you might be.

289
00:14:57,554 --> 00:14:59,230
I'm here to end it.

290
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:09,124
I know what this is about.

291
00:15:11,806 --> 00:15:13,591
The princess and the pea.

292
00:15:14,241 --> 00:15:16,275
Remember that story
about the chick who, uh,

293
00:15:16,395 --> 00:15:18,166
could feel a pea under
all those mattresses?

294
00:15:18,286 --> 00:15:20,498
- You're saying I'm a princess?
- No.

295
00:15:20,917 --> 00:15:22,808
We are.
Our relationship is.

296
00:15:22,928 --> 00:15:25,425
The one thing that
screws us up is, uh...

297
00:15:26,096 --> 00:15:28,208
secrets.
That's our pea.

298
00:15:29,856 --> 00:15:31,649
I don't have a secret.

299
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,370
No, but I do.

300
00:15:36,526 --> 00:15:38,235
And it's kind of...

301
00:15:38,923 --> 00:15:40,481
I hate lying to you.

302
00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:44,168
What did you do?

303
00:15:47,035 --> 00:15:50,670
It's funny because at the end of
the day, it's really no big deal, but...

304
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,332
you remember a while ago,
when I...

305
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,729
was having some tax problems
and I wanted to take out a loan

306
00:15:54,849 --> 00:15:56,582
against the business?
- And I said no.

307
00:15:56,702 --> 00:15:58,373
Well, I did it anyway.
I was desperate.

308
00:15:58,493 --> 00:16:01,210
How? You needed
my signature on the forms.

309
00:16:01,864 --> 00:16:03,119
I forged it.

310
00:16:05,046 --> 00:16:06,789
You risked everything?

311
00:16:07,335 --> 00:16:10,584
20 years of my hard work?
We could have lost it all!

312
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:13,419
Look, I know it was
wrong and I should have...

313
00:16:16,548 --> 00:16:18,123
Thank you, doctor.

314
00:16:18,827 --> 00:16:21,023
I wanted out of this,
but now I can leave

315
00:16:21,143 --> 00:16:23,168
with a clear conscience.

316
00:16:23,855 --> 00:16:27,240
Any contact you want with me
should be through my lawyer.

317
00:16:35,626 --> 00:16:38,053
Relax, ok?
He's gonna show up.

318
00:16:38,371 --> 00:16:40,275
He's probably having
too much fun jerking off

319
00:16:40,395 --> 00:16:42,920
imagining all the ways
that I've screwed him.

320
00:16:43,242 --> 00:16:45,001
Look, I wouldn't have
agreed to come here

321
00:16:45,121 --> 00:16:47,156
if he had objected,
which he didn't.

322
00:16:47,276 --> 00:16:48,504
You left him a message.

323
00:16:48,624 --> 00:16:50,444
He texted you back,
saying, "whatever."

324
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:52,132
He could have said no.

325
00:16:52,688 --> 00:16:54,120
Lizzie, I love you,
but you might not be

326
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,637
as huge a draw
as you think you are.

327
00:16:55,757 --> 00:16:57,294
The guy's been missing
in action for a week.

328
00:16:57,414 --> 00:16:58,947
I had to reschedule
9 surgeries.

329
00:16:59,067 --> 00:17:00,152
"Sorry, Mr. Ortiz.

330
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,729
You'll have to live another week
with that honkin' schnoz of yours

331
00:17:02,849 --> 00:17:05,226
because Dr. McNamara's
at home, festering."

332
00:17:05,346 --> 00:17:06,659
And what are you doing now?

333
00:17:06,727 --> 00:17:08,260
I'm expressing my anger, ok?

334
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:10,596
I'm not some baby
pouting in his shit.

335
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:12,622
No, you're having a tantrum

336
00:17:12,742 --> 00:17:15,354
and you're throwing it
all against the walls.

337
00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:25,709
Hey.
Thanks for doing this.

338
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:26,985
Back at ya.

339
00:17:32,063 --> 00:17:33,846
I'm glad you came, too.

340
00:17:33,914 --> 00:17:35,935
I figure if
I'm gonna sue you,

341
00:17:36,287 --> 00:17:38,348
I should tell you
in person.

342
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:42,278
So,

343
00:17:42,965 --> 00:17:45,630
last week ended
on quite a note.

344
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,926
Here, Sean.

345
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:50,684
I'm not interested in
what you have to say.

346
00:17:50,804 --> 00:17:53,182
Save it for your lawyer.
- Just take it.

347
00:17:58,347 --> 00:17:59,999
$256,000?

348
00:18:00,067 --> 00:18:03,368
I told you I was temporarily
cash-poor. It was an emergency.

349
00:18:03,646 --> 00:18:06,243
I'm paying you back,
with interest.

350
00:18:06,998 --> 00:18:09,273
What about this strikes
you as funny, Sean?

351
00:18:09,341 --> 00:18:12,159
It's just so classic,
you know?

352
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:15,528
He totals your life and then
offers to pay for the repairs.

353
00:18:15,864 --> 00:18:17,791
Money fixes everything.

354
00:18:18,261 --> 00:18:21,116
Saves him the trouble
of having a conscience.

355
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:22,551
And he's a prick.

356
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,253
Was this check intended
to fix everything?

357
00:18:26,321 --> 00:18:28,302
Look, what I did was wrong.
I know that,

358
00:18:28,422 --> 00:18:30,645
and I understand if he's
pissed or upset or...

359
00:18:30,765 --> 00:18:33,078
Wait. He can cry
real tears, too, ok?

360
00:18:33,198 --> 00:18:35,491
Everything he does,
everything he says

361
00:18:35,611 --> 00:18:37,351
is about getting
what he needs,

362
00:18:37,471 --> 00:18:38,766
power and money,

363
00:18:38,886 --> 00:18:42,279
and it doesn't matter who
he hurts or cheats or kills.

364
00:18:46,221 --> 00:18:48,969
So you...
think

365
00:18:49,089 --> 00:18:51,450
Christian is capable
of killing you?

366
00:18:53,278 --> 00:18:55,892
Jesus, Sean.
You really do need help.

367
00:18:56,438 --> 00:18:58,114
Are you really
that paranoid?

368
00:18:58,182 --> 00:18:59,620
Look,
I'm just saying

369
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:02,219
he takes no responsibility
for anything he does

370
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:04,219
because there's always
an easy way out.

371
00:19:04,287 --> 00:19:05,238
He married Liz

372
00:19:05,358 --> 00:19:06,731
when he thought
he was dying

373
00:19:06,851 --> 00:19:08,572
and needed
a baby-sitter for his kids.

374
00:19:08,692 --> 00:19:10,576
Then, when he was
suddenly healthy,

375
00:19:10,696 --> 00:19:12,645
he dumped her,
then tried to pay her off,

376
00:19:12,765 --> 00:19:16,163
as if money would
somehow take away the pain.

377
00:19:16,231 --> 00:19:18,598
Yeah, go ahead.
You... you tell him, Liz.

378
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:22,294
I didn't agree to let Dr. Cruz
join us so that you two could...

379
00:19:22,646 --> 00:19:24,370
play her
against each other.

380
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:27,119
I won't allow you to
put her in the middle.

381
00:19:27,447 --> 00:19:28,570
Thank you.

382
00:19:34,403 --> 00:19:37,235
Dr. Cruz, is there
something you'd like to say?

383
00:19:38,107 --> 00:19:39,830
I guess
I just...

384
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:42,174
I'm not used
to feeling so, um,

385
00:19:42,294 --> 00:19:43,423
protected.

386
00:19:44,164 --> 00:19:46,373
I was forced to take
sides growing up,

387
00:19:46,493 --> 00:19:49,812
and it was a constant
battlefield. It was just...

388
00:19:49,932 --> 00:19:51,984
You don't feel
protected at work?

389
00:19:52,104 --> 00:19:55,163
- 'Course she does.
- I'm very protective of Liz.

390
00:19:55,283 --> 00:19:57,192
I was asking Dr. Cruz.

391
00:19:59,789 --> 00:20:01,332
In the beginning...

392
00:20:02,672 --> 00:20:06,584
I felt that, um,
Sean and Christian

393
00:20:07,388 --> 00:20:08,355
were

394
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,450
family,
you know.

395
00:20:11,286 --> 00:20:13,254
But they have been
so busy

396
00:20:13,374 --> 00:20:14,990
hating each other,

397
00:20:15,978 --> 00:20:17,772
the rest of us
don't even exist,

398
00:20:17,892 --> 00:20:19,783
unless to take sides.

399
00:20:20,336 --> 00:20:22,037
It's never about
what we need,

400
00:20:22,157 --> 00:20:24,534
about what we want,
about what we deserve

401
00:20:24,654 --> 00:20:26,528
for putting up
with your bullshit.

402
00:20:26,648 --> 00:20:28,322
Well, that's unfair, Liz.

403
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,032
You know
what's unfair, Sean?

404
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:33,940
That I've been working at
McNamara/Troy for years,

405
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,418
and neither of you have ever
come up to me and said,

406
00:20:36,538 --> 00:20:38,448
"Liz, we'd like
to make you a partner.

407
00:20:38,568 --> 00:20:40,409
We would like for you
to have parity with us

408
00:20:40,529 --> 00:20:42,908
because you work so hard,
because you deserve it."

409
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:45,471
And you know what?
It's time, now.

410
00:20:47,533 --> 00:20:50,532
I mean, maybe it's the only way
you two will survive...

411
00:20:50,652 --> 00:20:52,811
shaking up
this dysfunctional duo

412
00:20:52,931 --> 00:20:56,515
and making it
McNamara, Troy & Cruz.

413
00:20:59,423 --> 00:21:00,322
Lizzie...

414
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:02,357
Oh, don't, don't.
Don't patronize me.

415
00:21:02,425 --> 00:21:03,712
You're right, Liz.

416
00:21:03,832 --> 00:21:06,233
We should have done
that a long time ago,

417
00:21:06,353 --> 00:21:09,839
when there still was a
McNamara/Troy for Cruz to join.

418
00:21:11,373 --> 00:21:13,325
I always considered you
a partner...

419
00:21:13,445 --> 00:21:14,431
In spirit.

420
00:21:14,551 --> 00:21:15,588
Screw you,
Christian.

421
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,736
Oh, come on. You're the
only one who can help us

422
00:21:17,804 --> 00:21:19,371
figure out how we
got here. Please, ok?

423
00:21:19,439 --> 00:21:21,669
- How two brothers could...
- Want to kill each other?

424
00:21:21,789 --> 00:21:22,976
Have you read the Bible?

425
00:21:23,096 --> 00:21:25,057
Believe me,
we're not the first.

426
00:21:26,288 --> 00:21:29,439
Dr. Cruz, why did you agree
to come here today?

427
00:21:31,471 --> 00:21:35,572
Because I figured that
this would be a safe space

428
00:21:36,441 --> 00:21:38,602
to open up and
be honest with them

429
00:21:38,722 --> 00:21:40,516
about how I felt
and that...

430
00:21:40,636 --> 00:21:43,573
maybe, with a
professional present,

431
00:21:43,693 --> 00:21:45,091
I could tell them

432
00:21:46,123 --> 00:21:50,228
what self-centered,
egotistical assholes they are.

433
00:21:50,647 --> 00:21:51,871
And...

434
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:57,178
and just...
and also that, um...

435
00:22:00,312 --> 00:22:01,318
And what?

436
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:04,066
That, uh...

437
00:22:04,988 --> 00:22:06,664
That I am pregnant.

438
00:22:10,182 --> 00:22:12,914
So? Congratulations.
You want my permission?

439
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:18,127
It's Sean's sperm.

440
00:22:18,747 --> 00:22:20,176
And you know
what they say...

441
00:22:20,296 --> 00:22:21,998
you're only as sick
as your secrets,

442
00:22:22,118 --> 00:22:23,926
and I am
up-to-my-ass tired

443
00:22:24,046 --> 00:22:27,097
of keeping everybody else's
goddamned secrets.

444
00:22:28,015 --> 00:22:29,778
So I asked Sean and...

445
00:22:30,181 --> 00:22:32,041
he was kind enough
to oblige.

446
00:22:32,161 --> 00:22:33,777
You really think that you
have a better chance

447
00:22:33,897 --> 00:22:35,925
of avoiding birth defects
with his splooge?

448
00:22:36,045 --> 00:22:37,564
Well, at least I don't
have to be worried

449
00:22:37,684 --> 00:22:39,843
that he's gonna ask me
to get rid of the child

450
00:22:39,963 --> 00:22:41,837
if it isn't perfect.
- That wasn't the reason.

451
00:22:41,957 --> 00:22:43,797
No matter what
this child is or isn't,

452
00:22:43,917 --> 00:22:46,713
I'm gonna be able to love it
because I have that capacity.

453
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:49,145
That's how you and I
are different, Christian.

454
00:22:49,265 --> 00:22:51,415
I can love
a thing for itself,

455
00:22:51,535 --> 00:22:53,469
imperfections and all.

456
00:22:58,045 --> 00:23:00,593
They would be lost
without each other, doctor.

457
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:03,308
Jesus, Liz. I thought
you'd at least be objective.

458
00:23:03,428 --> 00:23:05,771
You know I'd be better off
on my own.

459
00:23:07,172 --> 00:23:11,011
You don't even believe that
you exist without Christian.

460
00:23:11,131 --> 00:23:14,245
You can't tell who you are,
how you're doing,

461
00:23:14,365 --> 00:23:17,947
what you're worth without
comparing yourself to him.

462
00:23:18,067 --> 00:23:21,153
The rest of us, what are we?
We're just elevator music.

463
00:23:21,273 --> 00:23:23,568
You both deserve each other.

464
00:23:23,688 --> 00:23:25,638
But I'll tell you what
you don't deserve.

465
00:23:25,758 --> 00:23:28,095
You don't deserve me.

466
00:23:41,989 --> 00:23:45,291
How do you guys feel about
everything she just said?

467
00:23:48,911 --> 00:23:51,911
So you give Liz your sperm without
telling me? Why would you do that?

468
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:53,259
She asked.

469
00:23:53,379 --> 00:23:55,522
She wants a family.
She is my family.

470
00:23:55,589 --> 00:23:58,413
I thought I could help her
and we... I...

471
00:23:58,533 --> 00:24:00,622
you hurt her so much,

472
00:24:00,742 --> 00:24:02,497
I thought it was
the least I could do.

473
00:24:02,564 --> 00:24:04,570
You're gonna raise
another child?

474
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:07,050
I signed papers.
I have no leg rights

475
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,843
and I am fine with that.

476
00:24:15,109 --> 00:24:16,757
I'm not fine with it.

477
00:24:17,712 --> 00:24:20,344
I screwed up.
I gave it to her.

478
00:24:20,464 --> 00:24:22,697
I thought because of her age,
it would never take,

479
00:24:22,817 --> 00:24:25,556
but the drugs and the...
oh, Jesus.

480
00:24:26,561 --> 00:24:28,134
What am I gonna do?

481
00:24:28,254 --> 00:24:29,745
I don't want another kid.

482
00:24:29,865 --> 00:24:31,756
I just wanted her
to be happy.

483
00:24:34,126 --> 00:24:35,952
Anything else
you're hiding?

484
00:24:36,656 --> 00:24:38,731
At least I paid back
what I borrowed.

485
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,034
Stole, embezzled,
not borrowed.

486
00:24:41,101 --> 00:24:43,276
But I'm squeaky
clean now, aren't I?

487
00:24:45,287 --> 00:24:47,734
Anything else you're
keeping from me?

488
00:24:53,399 --> 00:24:55,829
I'm afraid
we'll have to stop.

489
00:24:56,215 --> 00:24:58,444
That's all we have time
for today.

490
00:24:59,684 --> 00:25:01,142
You're shittin' me.

491
00:25:03,672 --> 00:25:04,594
Here.

492
00:25:07,342 --> 00:25:09,135
For a double session.

493
00:25:11,398 --> 00:25:12,962
Keep the change.

494
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:15,064
I have another patient.

495
00:25:15,132 --> 00:25:17,684
I'll pay for their
makeup session, too.

496
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,985
You can keep
that change as well.

497
00:25:21,105 --> 00:25:23,366
Maybe Dr. Griffin
would like a prostitute.

498
00:25:23,486 --> 00:25:24,807
Worked so well with me.

499
00:25:24,927 --> 00:25:26,424
Remember when
you got Matt one?

500
00:25:26,544 --> 00:25:29,080
Look, I'm sure you have patients
who sometimes need extra time,

501
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,314
so you figure things
out so they can continue.

502
00:25:31,382 --> 00:25:33,238
You know, I'm a doctor.
I know how this works.

503
00:25:33,358 --> 00:25:35,192
Your hour is over,
Dr. Troy.

504
00:25:36,382 --> 00:25:38,643
I can see you and
Dr. McNamara next week

505
00:25:38,763 --> 00:25:40,323
at the same time
if you'd like.

506
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:41,639
If I'd like?

507
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:44,612
What I'd like to do
is stick my shiny,

508
00:25:44,732 --> 00:25:47,782
pointy shoe up your smug,
enlightened ass.

509
00:25:47,902 --> 00:25:49,710
That's what
I'd like to do.

510
00:25:50,231 --> 00:25:51,914
And you, buddy boy?

511
00:25:52,034 --> 00:25:53,804
You can sue me
as much as you want.

512
00:25:53,924 --> 00:25:55,899
You hurt me,
you hurt yourself.

513
00:25:56,352 --> 00:25:57,675
And remember...

514
00:26:01,355 --> 00:26:03,720
I know where
all the bodies are buried.

515
00:26:16,247 --> 00:26:17,990
Thank you, doctor.

516
00:26:19,324 --> 00:26:21,500
Now that you've seen
Christian Troy in action,

517
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:24,165
is there really any point
in another session?

518
00:26:28,339 --> 00:26:30,451
I'll be with you
in a minute.

519
00:26:42,846 --> 00:26:44,432
It's going straight
to voice mail.

520
00:26:44,552 --> 00:26:45,860
You didn't leave
a message?

521
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,368
Well,
he's 20 minutes late.

522
00:26:47,488 --> 00:26:49,161
What am I gonna say
to him, "hurry up"?

523
00:26:49,281 --> 00:26:50,069
I'll call.

524
00:26:50,189 --> 00:26:52,212
Sometimes when he sees your
number, he doesn't answer.

525
00:26:52,332 --> 00:26:54,159
- So now it's my fault?
- Oh, I don't know.

526
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,609
Maybe you gave him the wrong
address, the wrong time.

527
00:26:56,729 --> 00:26:58,173
Is this typical behavior?

528
00:26:58,241 --> 00:26:59,175
For Matt, yes.

529
00:26:59,295 --> 00:27:01,421
He's made a career out
of being irresponsible.

530
00:27:01,541 --> 00:27:03,198
I mean for the two of you.

531
00:27:03,684 --> 00:27:06,650
You're very divided on how to
deal with your son right now.

532
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:08,152
Is that usually the case?

533
00:27:08,219 --> 00:27:10,755
Usually Christian will
berate him or put him down.

534
00:27:10,875 --> 00:27:12,683
If he could do something
I could be proud of

535
00:27:12,803 --> 00:27:14,980
every once in a while, then
it'd be different, you know?

536
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,276
This is good.
This is important.

537
00:27:17,963 --> 00:27:20,441
The main reason
we invited your son here

538
00:27:20,561 --> 00:27:23,341
is to observe how
your co-parenting

539
00:27:23,461 --> 00:27:25,656
has become one
of your core issues.

540
00:27:25,776 --> 00:27:27,483
It's a chance
to work on it.

541
00:27:27,603 --> 00:27:28,724
Sean, uh,

542
00:27:28,844 --> 00:27:31,194
is there anything that
Christian has done for Matt

543
00:27:31,314 --> 00:27:33,677
as a father
that you do appreciate?

544
00:27:35,383 --> 00:27:37,022
How about you,
Christian?

545
00:27:37,142 --> 00:27:39,621
Have you ever thanked
Sean for raising your son

546
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,062
all those years?

547
00:27:43,342 --> 00:27:44,749
Perhaps you should.

548
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,315
A lot of times,
when we focus

549
00:27:47,435 --> 00:27:49,444
on what's good instead
of what's wrong,

550
00:27:49,564 --> 00:27:52,290
we can change our response
to the situation

551
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:54,170
and then to each other.

552
00:27:54,968 --> 00:27:56,212
Can we try that?

553
00:27:57,185 --> 00:27:57,905
Sure.

554
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:02,045
I appreciate...

555
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:05,279
the, um, the way
that you raised Matt

556
00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:06,838
over all those years,

557
00:28:07,341 --> 00:28:09,370
and I think
you did a great job.

558
00:28:09,956 --> 00:28:12,708
And I think you do the
best you can with him...

559
00:28:12,828 --> 00:28:14,281
When you want to.

560
00:28:19,733 --> 00:28:21,171
Oh, Matty,
come on in.

561
00:28:21,291 --> 00:28:22,715
You're only
a half-hour late.

562
00:28:22,835 --> 00:28:25,195
We tried calling.
Why didn't you answer?

563
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,707
Matt, I'm Dr. Griffin.
Thanks for coming.

564
00:28:30,827 --> 00:28:31,732
Pleasure.

565
00:28:31,852 --> 00:28:32,842
And this is?

566
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:34,042
Uh, Ramona.

567
00:28:34,162 --> 00:28:35,299
It's nice to meet you.

568
00:28:35,419 --> 00:28:36,969
You knew this wasn't
a lunch date.

569
00:28:37,089 --> 00:28:38,579
Why'd you bring
a girlfriend?

570
00:28:38,699 --> 00:28:40,767
Well, because she's not
my girlfriend anymore.

571
00:28:40,887 --> 00:28:42,158
She's my fiancee.

572
00:28:44,186 --> 00:28:47,268
Congratulations.
I guess the next question is,

573
00:28:47,388 --> 00:28:49,400
"how far along are you,
sweetie pie?"

574
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,161
You must be Christian.

575
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:53,398
Matt said that you would
be the first one

576
00:28:53,518 --> 00:28:55,024
to say something
inappropriate.

577
00:28:55,144 --> 00:28:57,419
Ramona, I'm Sean.
It's nice to meet you.

578
00:28:57,539 --> 00:28:59,648
- Nice to meet you, too.
- But...

579
00:29:00,966 --> 00:29:03,376
Why didn't you let us
know about this earlier?

580
00:29:03,496 --> 00:29:05,912
Well, why? Did I need to
get your approval first?

581
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:08,339
It would have been better
if we'd met her before.

582
00:29:08,459 --> 00:29:10,024
Yeah, and
now you have.

583
00:29:10,651 --> 00:29:12,117
What are you doing,
Matt?

584
00:29:12,185 --> 00:29:14,300
You knew this session
was important to us.

585
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,105
You had to spring this
on us here, now?

586
00:29:16,225 --> 00:29:18,385
Unfortunately, there wasn't
gonna be a better time.

587
00:29:18,505 --> 00:29:20,071
We've been packing
since last week

588
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:21,596
and we make
the move tomorrow.

589
00:29:21,716 --> 00:29:23,927
Wow. You're moving.
Let me guess.

590
00:29:24,047 --> 00:29:25,701
Skid Row has
a vacancy?

591
00:29:25,821 --> 00:29:29,670
Matt, uh, since Sean and
Christian invited only you

592
00:29:29,738 --> 00:29:32,940
to join the session, I'll have
to ask Ramona to wait outside.

593
00:29:33,007 --> 00:29:35,223
Well, I'd really like her
to stay, actually,

594
00:29:35,343 --> 00:29:37,782
especially since it might be
the last time they ever see us.

595
00:29:37,902 --> 00:29:39,798
What are you talking about?

596
00:29:41,585 --> 00:29:43,353
Just like
we talked about, baby.

597
00:29:43,421 --> 00:29:44,254
Yeah...

598
00:29:44,374 --> 00:29:46,817
You know uh,
let's sit first, yeah?

599
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,750
Look, I know
this... is sudden,

600
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:01,809
but I've actually been
thinking about it for a while.

601
00:30:03,184 --> 00:30:05,312
After Ramona and I
are married,

602
00:30:05,432 --> 00:30:07,659
we're gonna move out
to victorville.

603
00:30:07,977 --> 00:30:11,039
I'm gonna work for her father
in his carpet business

604
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:13,513
and take over payments
on their house.

605
00:30:13,932 --> 00:30:15,927
Jenna already has
a room there,

606
00:30:17,117 --> 00:30:18,139
and, uh...

607
00:30:19,528 --> 00:30:20,453
Well...

608
00:30:21,597 --> 00:30:22,901
Matt doesn't want

609
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:25,120
either of you
in his life anymore,

610
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,287
and once we leave,

611
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:28,634
he'd no longer like
to stay in contact.

612
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,126
Ok.
Fine by me.

613
00:30:36,246 --> 00:30:38,086
- Well, hold on a second.
- Oh, come on. Let it go.

614
00:30:38,206 --> 00:30:39,343
He'll be back
within 6 months,

615
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:41,704
tail between his legs,
and begging for a handout.

616
00:30:41,824 --> 00:30:43,491
You'd like to think that,
wouldn't you?

617
00:30:43,611 --> 00:30:45,209
Isn't this exactly what you
said before you became...

618
00:30:45,329 --> 00:30:47,907
addicted to meth,
got married to Kimber,

619
00:30:48,027 --> 00:30:50,958
dressed up as a mime,
and started robbing delis?

620
00:30:52,108 --> 00:30:53,731
Your future husband
has quite a past,

621
00:30:53,851 --> 00:30:55,270
just in case
you haven't heard.

622
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:57,552
Matt's actually told me
all about his past.

623
00:30:57,672 --> 00:30:59,915
You're not scaring me, if that's
what you're trying to do.

624
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:00,888
Really?

625
00:31:01,008 --> 00:31:02,379
Sweetie pie...

626
00:31:03,636 --> 00:31:05,354
Has he told you everything?

627
00:31:06,041 --> 00:31:07,063
Mostly about how,

628
00:31:07,183 --> 00:31:09,407
despite the fact that
he has two fathers,

629
00:31:09,527 --> 00:31:11,921
he's been made to feel
worthless all of the time.

630
00:31:12,041 --> 00:31:14,955
And that even when he tries
his hardest to do good,

631
00:31:15,075 --> 00:31:17,084
you both make him
feel like shit.

632
00:31:17,204 --> 00:31:19,148
Is that how you really
feel about us?

633
00:31:19,268 --> 00:31:21,930
You don't want us
in your life at all?

634
00:31:23,137 --> 00:31:25,246
Matt, we love you.
You're our son.

635
00:31:25,366 --> 00:31:27,092
I'm your punching bag.

636
00:31:31,953 --> 00:31:34,081
Nothing's ever
gone right for me.

637
00:31:34,853 --> 00:31:36,931
You know, I've always
been looking for stability

638
00:31:37,051 --> 00:31:38,976
and I think I've
finally found it now,

639
00:31:39,096 --> 00:31:41,121
and I don't want
to screw that up.

640
00:31:41,241 --> 00:31:43,954
And leaving is the only
way that's gonna work.

641
00:31:45,755 --> 00:31:47,931
I need to be around
people who support me.

642
00:31:48,051 --> 00:31:50,649
Hey, don't let the door
hit you on the way out.

643
00:31:50,769 --> 00:31:51,822
Thank you.

644
00:31:51,942 --> 00:31:53,380
You just made
this whole thing

645
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,531
so much easier for me.
Come on, baby. Let's go.

646
00:31:56,934 --> 00:31:58,859
- Matt, wait.
- Sean, let him go.

647
00:31:58,979 --> 00:32:00,734
We can talk about this.

648
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:06,120
Why are you being
so nonchalant?

649
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,763
You should be
trying to stop him.

650
00:32:07,883 --> 00:32:09,405
That's what
he wants you to do.

651
00:32:09,525 --> 00:32:10,880
Can't you see that?

652
00:32:11,265 --> 00:32:12,627
Sean,
if you'd like to...

653
00:32:12,747 --> 00:32:15,496
No, what I'd like is for him
to stop being so smug

654
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:17,883
and show that he gives
a shit about his son for once.

655
00:32:17,951 --> 00:32:19,250
There you go again.

656
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:22,153
Why don't you take responsibility
for your own failures, huh?

657
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:23,654
Instead of blaming me?

658
00:32:23,774 --> 00:32:25,169
Matt wants
to leave us both.

659
00:32:25,289 --> 00:32:26,256
Ok, hold on.

660
00:32:26,323 --> 00:32:28,544
Let's stop arguing about
who's at fault here.

661
00:32:28,664 --> 00:32:30,894
I'd like to help you
work together

662
00:32:31,195 --> 00:32:33,033
so we can see
some progress.

663
00:32:33,101 --> 00:32:35,091
There's no progress
to be made.

664
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:36,915
Matt's never
gonna change.

665
00:32:37,035 --> 00:32:38,577
Sean certainly is
not gonna change.

666
00:32:38,697 --> 00:32:40,163
and neither am I.

667
00:32:40,923 --> 00:32:42,711
The whole therapy thing
is bullshit.

668
00:32:42,831 --> 00:32:44,739
- You really believe that?
- Yes, I do.

669
00:32:44,859 --> 00:32:46,863
But are you at least
willing to try if it means

670
00:32:46,983 --> 00:32:48,874
keeping your relationship
with Sean together?

671
00:32:48,994 --> 00:32:50,397
I'm willing
to accept who I am

672
00:32:50,517 --> 00:32:52,474
and stop pretending
to be somebody else.

673
00:32:52,594 --> 00:32:53,814
Maybe if
you tried that

674
00:32:53,934 --> 00:32:55,893
once in a while, you
might not be so miserable.

675
00:32:56,013 --> 00:32:57,715
Like what, accept that
you're an asshole?

676
00:32:57,783 --> 00:33:00,485
Accept who you are,
that you can't change.

677
00:33:00,552 --> 00:33:01,795
You're right.

678
00:33:02,231 --> 00:33:04,200
We should stop
working at this.

679
00:33:04,745 --> 00:33:06,501
We should just
end it,

680
00:33:06,621 --> 00:33:07,539
end us.

681
00:33:07,659 --> 00:33:09,292
You don't want to end
this relationship.

682
00:33:09,412 --> 00:33:10,633
I am the only one
who's been able

683
00:33:10,753 --> 00:33:12,577
to put up with your shit
over all these years.

684
00:33:12,697 --> 00:33:13,560
No, I do.

685
00:33:13,628 --> 00:33:15,161
No, you don't.

686
00:33:15,229 --> 00:33:17,796
Then why did I have
an affair with Kimber?

687
00:33:17,864 --> 00:33:19,177
Why did you what?

688
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:21,892
We were sleeping together
for almost a month.

689
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:31,393
You slept with Kimber
while we were together?

690
00:33:31,513 --> 00:33:32,740
Hoping you'd find out.

691
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:35,103
Then you'd have
a reason to leave me.

692
00:33:36,242 --> 00:33:38,360
You realize
how pathetic you are?

693
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:43,303
Using her
to get rid of me?

694
00:33:44,728 --> 00:33:48,532
Why can't you be a man
and ask for what you want?

695
00:33:50,896 --> 00:33:52,669
You want me
to tell you now?

696
00:33:52,789 --> 00:33:54,616
Sure.
Go ahead.

697
00:33:54,935 --> 00:33:56,979
You want to leave,
just like Matt?

698
00:33:57,099 --> 00:34:00,021
There's the door, my friend.
Nobody is stopping you.

699
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:10,455
Dahlia, I'm sorry.
We're running a little late.

700
00:34:10,523 --> 00:34:12,955
Could you, uh, wait outside
for a few minutes?

701
00:34:13,075 --> 00:34:13,914
No.

702
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:15,975
This can't wait.

703
00:34:31,962 --> 00:34:33,562
It's really a miracle.

704
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:36,061
The bullet didn't even
chip any of his teeth.

705
00:34:36,129 --> 00:34:37,955
Nope, went through both
cheeks, in and out.

706
00:34:38,075 --> 00:34:39,230
He was very lucky.

707
00:34:39,298 --> 00:34:41,875
You were both very lucky
neither of you got hit.

708
00:34:41,995 --> 00:34:45,360
Well, like a lot of things,
it wasn't meant to be, I guess.

709
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,969
What's that
supposed to mean?

710
00:34:47,089 --> 00:34:49,115
Great job on your side,
by the way.

711
00:34:49,235 --> 00:34:51,731
He'll never even
see a scar when it heals.

712
00:34:53,109 --> 00:34:53,876
What?

713
00:34:54,379 --> 00:34:56,144
I'm saying
I'm impressed.

714
00:34:56,853 --> 00:34:57,746
Why?

715
00:34:57,814 --> 00:35:00,540
I'm focusing on the good,
like he said.

716
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:03,403
Trying to change
my response to the situation.

717
00:35:03,523 --> 00:35:06,938
I figured it would be better to
pay you a compliment right now.

718
00:35:07,457 --> 00:35:09,553
I'm not interested in your
compliments, all right?

719
00:35:09,673 --> 00:35:11,346
What I want right now
is a decision.

720
00:35:11,466 --> 00:35:12,369
About what?

721
00:35:12,489 --> 00:35:13,928
Either you're staying or
you're going, all right?

722
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,718
After all that talk,
after all that...

723
00:35:15,838 --> 00:35:17,548
therapeutic exercise,

724
00:35:17,668 --> 00:35:19,369
I want to know
where we stand.

725
00:35:19,437 --> 00:35:21,271
Maybe we should
talk about this...

726
00:35:21,339 --> 00:35:22,425
No more talking.

727
00:35:22,545 --> 00:35:24,886
There has been so much talking
I'm exhausted, all right?

728
00:35:25,006 --> 00:35:26,792
You need to make
a decision,

729
00:35:26,912 --> 00:35:28,391
and you need
to make it soon.

730
00:35:28,511 --> 00:35:29,678
I'll tell you what,

731
00:35:29,798 --> 00:35:31,790
you make a decision
by 5:00 this afternoon.

732
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:33,815
Otherwise, I'll make
one for you, huh?

733
00:35:33,935 --> 00:35:35,645
How's that for clarity?

734
00:35:46,474 --> 00:35:47,161
Hi.

735
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:49,776
Hi.

736
00:35:54,704 --> 00:35:56,584
Ok, so
just let me ask.

737
00:35:57,244 --> 00:35:59,533
Am I gonna have
to look for a new job?

738
00:35:59,601 --> 00:36:00,651
I can't see why.

739
00:36:00,771 --> 00:36:02,729
Sean's gonna have to work
somewhere if he leaves.

740
00:36:02,849 --> 00:36:04,355
I'm sure he'll
take you with him,

741
00:36:04,475 --> 00:36:05,827
maybe even
give you that, uh,

742
00:36:05,947 --> 00:36:07,403
partnership
you're looking for.

743
00:36:07,523 --> 00:36:09,548
So who's to say, if
you two were to split up,

744
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:10,873
I would go with Sean?

745
00:36:10,941 --> 00:36:13,472
I think you made that clear
when you chose to use his

746
00:36:13,592 --> 00:36:16,003
man juice
in your Turkey baster.

747
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,446
You don't get it.

748
00:36:18,566 --> 00:36:20,944
No, I get it, and
I get it fine, ok?

749
00:36:21,064 --> 00:36:22,970
After all these years,
after the...

750
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:24,582
crap that
I put you through...

751
00:36:24,702 --> 00:36:26,191
the divorce,
everything else...

752
00:36:26,311 --> 00:36:28,235
he's stable,
you know?

753
00:36:29,401 --> 00:36:31,719
At least he pretends
to be a good guy.

754
00:36:32,573 --> 00:36:33,277
Look,

755
00:36:33,723 --> 00:36:36,053
I don't have to defend
my choice to you.

756
00:36:36,572 --> 00:36:37,947
If it hurts that

757
00:36:38,299 --> 00:36:40,892
I don't like you best or
I didn't pick you yet again,

758
00:36:41,012 --> 00:36:41,991
sorry.

759
00:36:42,111 --> 00:36:45,118
I picked Sean
because, unlike you,

760
00:36:45,755 --> 00:36:48,068
he won't try to own
me and my baby.

761
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:50,716
I mean,
he did this for me.

762
00:36:51,504 --> 00:36:53,026
He doesn't want
anything back.

763
00:36:53,146 --> 00:36:54,745
He knows
it's mine and...

764
00:36:54,865 --> 00:36:56,783
he has nothing
to do with it.

765
00:36:56,766 --> 00:36:57,554
Right.

766
00:36:58,123 --> 00:36:59,548
Selfless old Sean.

767
00:37:00,185 --> 00:37:01,341
And that's it?

768
00:37:01,994 --> 00:37:04,236
That's the whole reason
that you picked him?

769
00:37:04,356 --> 00:37:06,665
Yes, that's it, the whole
reason I picked him.

770
00:37:06,785 --> 00:37:08,560
Well,
I think it's bullshit.

771
00:37:08,945 --> 00:37:10,488
It's your little way
of holding on.

772
00:37:10,608 --> 00:37:12,077
You can pretend
all you want


773
00:37:12,197 --> 00:37:14,342
it's just about you,
but you without us?

774
00:37:14,462 --> 00:37:15,616
Who are you?

775
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,225
Maybe.

776
00:37:19,417 --> 00:37:20,712
But I never have to worry

777
00:37:20,832 --> 00:37:22,934
about you disappearing
out of my life.

778
00:37:23,054 --> 00:37:24,370
You need me too much

779
00:37:24,438 --> 00:37:26,740
to bolster up that fragile
ego of yours.

780
00:37:26,807 --> 00:37:28,305
With Sean,
it's different.

781
00:37:28,425 --> 00:37:31,580
Maybe this connection will
help us to stay connected.

782
00:37:32,753 --> 00:37:33,759
So what?

783
00:37:34,546 --> 00:37:36,021
Is that so wrong?

784
00:37:50,015 --> 00:37:52,661
Uh, your receptionist
said I could see him?

785
00:37:52,781 --> 00:37:55,094
It'll be a while
before he wakes up.

786
00:37:55,214 --> 00:37:56,200
And you are?

787
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,016
I'm the husband of
the woman who shot him.

788
00:37:59,136 --> 00:38:00,139
Ron Mark.

789
00:38:01,061 --> 00:38:02,537
I'm Sean McNamara.

790
00:38:02,657 --> 00:38:04,414
My partner and I
did the surgery.

791
00:38:04,534 --> 00:38:06,274
I'll take this.
Thank you.

792
00:38:06,796 --> 00:38:09,326
Gee, you can imagine
I feel pretty terrible.

793
00:38:10,701 --> 00:38:12,930
Dr. Griffin's a decent man,
you know?

794
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:14,891
He was just
trying to help.

795
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,770
Where is your wife,
by the way?

796
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:18,493
Nowhere near here,
I hope.

797
00:38:18,613 --> 00:38:19,921
She's in custody.

798
00:38:21,747 --> 00:38:24,443
I was always telling her
how crazy she was.

799
00:38:24,563 --> 00:38:25,903
Made her furious.

800
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:29,234
Now I'm wondering
if I was actually

801
00:38:29,354 --> 00:38:30,950
making it come true,
you know?

802
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:33,801
I mean, could I have
driven her crazy?

803
00:38:34,438 --> 00:38:37,981
Well, it's a chicken and egg
kind of question, you know?

804
00:38:38,048 --> 00:38:39,685
I think you'll
make yourself crazy

805
00:38:39,805 --> 00:38:41,847
trying to get to
the bottom of that.

806
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,492
You know
the real irony of it all?

807
00:38:44,612 --> 00:38:47,193
She'll probably use
insanity as her defense.

808
00:38:48,148 --> 00:38:48,902
Man.

809
00:38:50,018 --> 00:38:52,000
If I could just turn
the clock back and...

810
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,131
do that last session
over again.

811
00:38:55,808 --> 00:38:57,786
What would you do
differently?

812
00:38:57,906 --> 00:39:00,736
I'd try to see myself
through her eyes.

813
00:39:00,856 --> 00:39:02,961
You know, I went in there
with an agenda.

814
00:39:03,081 --> 00:39:05,291
I wasn't being open.
I wasn't being honest.

815
00:39:05,411 --> 00:39:07,158
I was just playing
the same old games,

816
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:09,481
talking in sports metaphors
which make her crazy,

817
00:39:09,601 --> 00:39:11,243
playing the
wounded party,

818
00:39:11,363 --> 00:39:13,339
making her feel like
a monster, and then...

819
00:39:13,459 --> 00:39:15,518
bam... I throw
divorce papers at her.

820
00:39:15,638 --> 00:39:18,499
She took a gun and she
tried to kill her therapist.

821
00:39:18,619 --> 00:39:20,723
That's not within
any reasonable range

822
00:39:20,843 --> 00:39:22,861
of human behavior
I'm aware of.

823
00:39:25,962 --> 00:39:26,967
Well...

824
00:39:27,463 --> 00:39:29,414
I'll tell him
you stopped by.

825
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:30,537
Thank you.

826
00:39:36,084 --> 00:39:38,916
You know, no one's ever
totally without blame.

827
00:39:39,036 --> 00:39:39,939
No one.

828
00:39:55,056 --> 00:39:56,538
I'd like to kill him.

829
00:39:56,658 --> 00:39:59,246
I'd like to take a gun
and I'd like to...

830
00:39:59,531 --> 00:40:00,940
shoot him
in the head.

831
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,621
No, scratch that.
I'd like to take a knife...

832
00:40:04,057 --> 00:40:06,520
slice his balls off.
That's what I'd like to do.

833
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,175
You're a therapist.
I can say that kind of shit

834
00:40:08,295 --> 00:40:10,119
and you're not gonna go
to the police, right?

835
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:11,677
I mean, you know
what I'm talking about.

836
00:40:11,797 --> 00:40:13,353
I'm just angry,
that's all.

837
00:40:13,813 --> 00:40:16,723
I think I know the difference
between feelings and fact.

838
00:40:16,843 --> 00:40:19,642
Ten minutes late at
this point in the game?

839
00:40:19,762 --> 00:40:22,288
He's so passive-aggressive,
it makes me sick.

840
00:40:22,355 --> 00:40:23,446
Is it a pattern?

841
00:40:23,566 --> 00:40:26,135
Do you feel like he's always
keeping you waiting?

842
00:40:26,255 --> 00:40:28,327
It is kind of become
that way, I must say.

843
00:40:28,395 --> 00:40:30,529
I mean, he doesn't know
what he's doing.

844
00:40:30,597 --> 00:40:33,696
So, it sounds like
you're more...

845
00:40:33,816 --> 00:40:36,595
certain of wanting
the relationship to continue,

846
00:40:36,715 --> 00:40:38,321
whereas you see...

847
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:41,233
- Sean.
- Sean. Sorry.

848
00:40:41,353 --> 00:40:44,350
Whereas you see Sean
as having issues,

849
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:46,827
so to speak.
Have I got that right?

850
00:40:46,947 --> 00:40:47,919
Kind of.

851
00:40:50,617 --> 00:40:52,240
- Speak of the devil.
- Sorry.

852
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,485
Big mess on Wilshire.

853
00:40:53,553 --> 00:40:55,301
It's always something,
ain't it, pal?

854
00:40:55,421 --> 00:40:57,695
Hello, doctor.
I'm Sean McNamara.

855
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,923
Karen Singer.
Nice to meet you.

856
00:41:00,996 --> 00:41:01,817
So...

857
00:41:03,024 --> 00:41:05,452
has he been filling you in
on what a screwed-up,

858
00:41:05,572 --> 00:41:06,998
passive-aggressive
wimp I am?

859
00:41:07,066 --> 00:41:10,077
Is that your perception
of how he views you?

860
00:41:10,197 --> 00:41:11,478
Oh, I don't know.

861
00:41:11,598 --> 00:41:14,217
I don't know what's real
about anything anymore.

862
00:41:14,337 --> 00:41:15,299
You don't?

863
00:41:15,419 --> 00:41:17,287
Why doesn't that
surprise me?

864
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:19,935
Are we gonna spend
the whole session...

865
00:41:20,055 --> 00:41:22,013
taking pot shots
at each other?

866
00:41:24,017 --> 00:41:25,131
I don't know.

867
00:41:26,706 --> 00:41:27,662
Are we?

868
00:41:29,387 --> 00:41:31,532
So,
doctors,

869
00:41:32,129 --> 00:41:34,063
let's start
at the beginning.

870
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:38,495
Tell me what you don't like
about your relationship.

871
00:41:41,005 --> 00:41:44,977
