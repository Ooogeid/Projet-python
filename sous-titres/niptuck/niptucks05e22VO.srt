00:00:00,182 --> 00:00:01,420
<i>Previously on</i> Nip/Tuck...

2
00:00:01,622 --> 00:00:04,295
- You ever screwed on nitrous?
- It's dangerous.

3
00:00:04,463 --> 00:00:07,285
You can trust me.
I'm an anesthesiologist.

4
00:00:07,573 --> 00:00:10,551
- You two some sort of couple now?
- They offered me a deal at penetrate.

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:11,761
To do porn?

6
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:13,787
We just had to snatch her up.

7
00:00:13,912 --> 00:00:15,412
How's my baby doing?

8
00:00:15,537 --> 00:00:18,074
The tumor has spread
to the supraclavicular lymph nodes.

9
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:20,019
- Give me a ballpark.
- 6 months.

10
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:21,812
What are you doing here?

11
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:23,898
I want you to marry me.

12
00:00:28,177 --> 00:00:31,245
Tell us what you don't like
about yourself, Ms. Blaylock.

13
00:00:33,726 --> 00:00:35,144
Me first, I guess.

14
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:40,206
- What is that? Something bite you?
- Yeah.

15
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,470
My bad.

16
00:00:43,631 --> 00:00:44,557
You did that?

17
00:00:44,682 --> 00:00:47,332
I was trying to match
the one she gave me.

18
00:00:50,941 --> 00:00:52,801
That's a good thing
you had italian for lunch.

19
00:00:52,921 --> 00:00:56,514
- That garlic breath might saves us.
- That's hollywood bullshit.

20
00:00:56,683 --> 00:01:00,302
- We love garlic as much as anyone else.
- The sun doesn't melt us.

21
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:03,866
We don't get burned by holy water.
And looking at crosses is no big deal.

22
00:01:03,991 --> 00:01:06,232
So, you're vampires. OK.

23
00:01:06,521 --> 00:01:07,921
If you have to label us,

24
00:01:08,046 --> 00:01:10,584
we prefer to be called sangs,
not vampires.

25
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:14,178
- You actually drink each other's blood?
- We have routine blood work done,

26
00:01:14,303 --> 00:01:16,200
so we know
we're not sharing any diseases.

27
00:01:18,957 --> 00:01:22,107
We just pierce the skin
and offer each other a taste.

28
00:01:24,559 --> 00:01:25,959
It's our intimacy,

29
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:29,598
sharing
this most sacred of bodily fluids.

30
00:01:30,621 --> 00:01:32,550
But last week, we took it too far.

31
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:33,759
I'll say.

32
00:01:33,884 --> 00:01:35,764
You realize
how close you got to her artery?

33
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,056
I hit it.

34
00:01:39,883 --> 00:01:40,983
By mistake.

35
00:01:46,317 --> 00:01:47,317
Take me.

36
00:01:57,445 --> 00:01:59,295
The paramedics had to come.

37
00:01:59,915 --> 00:02:01,727
The vascular surgeons stopped
the bleeding,

38
00:02:01,847 --> 00:02:04,582
but the E.R. Docs did
a horrible job suturing the skin.

39
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,180
It took me almost losing her

40
00:02:06,305 --> 00:02:09,587
to realize that we'd gone too far
with the blood lust.

41
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:10,896
Like addicts.

42
00:02:11,448 --> 00:02:14,258
Our behavior's become dangerous
and we need to stop it.

43
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:15,885
So, you're off the blood?

44
00:02:16,122 --> 00:02:18,345
- Congrats.
- Sneer if you like, doctor.

45
00:02:18,558 --> 00:02:22,562
But the restorative powers of blood
can be kind of addicting, you know?

46
00:02:23,164 --> 00:02:25,180
You get this immediate rush.

47
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,180
Your color changes.

48
00:02:27,592 --> 00:02:30,027
It can restore your heart,
your liver, kidneys.

49
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,029
We're familiar
with the effects of transfusion.

50
00:02:32,231 --> 00:02:34,616
We were just hoping
to preserve ourselves,

51
00:02:34,741 --> 00:02:37,239
to stay young and vital
as long as possible.

52
00:02:37,876 --> 00:02:39,742
As plastic surgeons,
you should relate.

53
00:02:39,979 --> 00:02:43,983
The idea of chasing immortality
is something you make a killing off of.

54
00:02:53,987 --> 00:02:56,254
Synchro: Guig

55
00:02:56,379 --> 00:02:57,529
Episode 522

56
00:02:57,654 --> 00:03:00,421
"Giselle Blaylock
and Legend Chandler"

57
00:04:49,266 --> 00:04:50,266


58
00:04:51,006 --> 00:04:52,006
It's...

59
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:53,500
9:00.

60
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:56,045
Where are you?

61
00:05:00,937 --> 00:05:03,344
<i>Oh, there's my little honey bunny.</i>

62
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,353
Sorry I'm late, darling.
I was on a winnin'streak.

63
00:05:08,691 --> 00:05:10,741
Just couldn't tear myself away.

64
00:05:10,974 --> 00:05:13,013
And don't get started
on how I have a gambling problem.

65
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:16,689
It isn't a problem unless you lose.
And tonight, baby, I won big.

66
00:05:16,814 --> 00:05:18,233
You and this little lady.

67
00:05:19,005 --> 00:05:23,003
And she decided to spend her winnings
by getting rid of her saddlebags.

68
00:05:23,128 --> 00:05:25,628
Walked right in here
after hitting the jackpot.

69
00:05:25,753 --> 00:05:27,743
You are a genius.
You know that, Harland?

70
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:31,246
Where else but in Vegas can you get
your thighs sucked at 9:00 at night?

71
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,374
Hey, sugar,
I think that was your idea.

72
00:05:34,002 --> 00:05:36,846
And it was a good one.
When in Rome.

73
00:05:36,971 --> 00:05:39,505
I mean, if 2 people
can get married in an Elvis chapel

74
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,473
at 4:00 in the morning...

75
00:05:42,496 --> 00:05:44,146
Congratulations, Dixie.

76
00:05:44,486 --> 00:05:46,387
- Very exciting.
- I know.

77
00:05:47,362 --> 00:05:49,056
Now, sugar, how's your aunt doing?

78
00:05:49,955 --> 00:05:52,101
The doctors say
it won't be long now.

79
00:05:53,209 --> 00:05:54,895
You're a good girl, Dixie.

80
00:05:55,187 --> 00:05:56,787
That's why I love you.

81
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:59,400
I just hope
she appreciates your visits.

82
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,876
Now,
let's get this show on the road.

83
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:05,401
The sooner we play doctor,
the sooner we can play doctor.

84
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:28,804
What?

85
00:06:29,924 --> 00:06:32,474
What are you waiting for?
She wants to know the truth.

86
00:06:34,408 --> 00:06:37,318
He's all nervous
about hurting your feelings, but me?

87
00:06:37,443 --> 00:06:39,243
I don't have that problem.

88
00:06:39,368 --> 00:06:41,278
You're a relic.
We want you out of our bed.

89
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:44,066
- Shut up, you stupid skank.
- Hey, no drama in here.

90
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,237
Look.

91
00:06:46,999 --> 00:06:49,950
Eden and I have been talking this over.
Talking about the future.

92
00:06:50,223 --> 00:06:52,619
Talking about a lot of things.
The bottom line, baby...

93
00:06:53,221 --> 00:06:54,621
This is not working out.

94
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,139
- You're breaking up with me?
- Yes.

95
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:02,446
- Let me guess why.
- 'Cause your face is like an old purse

96
00:07:02,571 --> 00:07:04,468
from all
that horrible tanning booth damage,

97
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,800
your hair is like the hay
I feed my horse,

98
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:09,817
and your knees kind or resemble
a circus elephant.

99
00:07:09,942 --> 00:07:13,307
- I should be feeding you peanuts.
- Wait till you turn 30, horseface.

100
00:07:13,843 --> 00:07:16,563
They'll be putting you
on a train right to the glue factory.

101
00:07:16,688 --> 00:07:19,897
And for your information,
Christian Troy, my ex,

102
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:23,272
who happens to be
the best plastic surgeon in the city,

103
00:07:23,397 --> 00:07:26,937
told me 2 weeks ago he couldn't find
one thing that needs improvement on me.

104
00:07:27,062 --> 00:07:29,907
In fact, I was probably
the most gorgeous woman,

105
00:07:30,156 --> 00:07:33,243
perfect woman,
that he has ever seen for her age.

106
00:07:33,489 --> 00:07:35,512
For. Her. Age.

107
00:07:36,847 --> 00:07:38,957
- Ram.
- You gotta get realistic here.

108
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,968
Kimmy, there does come a time

109
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:43,595
when there's no more procedures,
no more plastic surgery.

110
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,020
Youth goes away.

111
00:07:45,603 --> 00:07:48,383
And when you've been trying to keep
a hold of it as much as you have,

112
00:07:48,731 --> 00:07:50,169
it's no longer sexy.

113
00:07:50,294 --> 00:07:51,959
It's just desperate.

114
00:07:58,499 --> 00:07:59,699
You know what?

115
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,730
You've just done me a big favor.

116
00:08:02,974 --> 00:08:06,701
I am a symbol of sensuality,
glamour, and power,

117
00:08:06,826 --> 00:08:10,157
and I have been wasting my time
with you two low-rent,

118
00:08:10,514 --> 00:08:11,864
scumbag assholes.

119
00:08:12,351 --> 00:08:13,951
I don't need you anymore, Ram.

120
00:08:14,692 --> 00:08:15,691
I will survive.

121
00:08:15,816 --> 00:08:18,831
No, in fact,
I am going to thrive without you.

122
00:08:23,609 --> 00:08:26,547
The legend of Kimber Henry
will live forever.

123
00:08:34,242 --> 00:08:36,592
We have to do
a little muscle repair,

124
00:08:36,866 --> 00:08:38,166
resect the skin

125
00:08:40,307 --> 00:08:41,307
here

126
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,020
and here.

127
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,366
You all right?

128
00:08:49,119 --> 00:08:51,012
Here, babe. Have some.

129
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:56,118
I'm afraid to ask.
What is that stuff?

130
00:08:56,761 --> 00:08:58,039
What is this shit, legend?

131
00:08:58,388 --> 00:09:00,507
It's got all the vegetables and minerals
we need.

132
00:09:00,627 --> 00:09:02,752
I thought you were giving me
the blood from a steak or...

133
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:05,358
We are weaning ourselves off,
remember?

134
00:09:09,388 --> 00:09:11,988
I guess
I won't be needing these anymore.

135
00:09:13,661 --> 00:09:15,789
Biowaste. I'll dispose of them.

136
00:09:17,035 --> 00:09:19,735
What about yours?
Must be a bitch to floss.

137
00:09:20,479 --> 00:09:22,179
Mine are the real thing.

138
00:09:22,483 --> 00:09:24,313
Dentist has to file them down
next week.

139
00:09:27,511 --> 00:09:29,751
Well,
if there are no more questions...

140
00:09:29,876 --> 00:09:32,276
Dr. McNamara will see you
in surgery.

141
00:09:37,989 --> 00:09:39,089
You're cool.

142
00:09:39,474 --> 00:09:41,330
Most people get off on judging us.

143
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,750
- Live and let live.
- Emphasis on "live."

144
00:09:45,853 --> 00:09:47,553
You only go around once.

145
00:10:24,181 --> 00:10:26,631
<i>I've figured out
a way to live forever.</i>

146
00:10:32,551 --> 00:10:33,601
Cryogenics?

147
00:10:37,358 --> 00:10:39,108
I'm gonna need your help.

148
00:10:42,456 --> 00:10:45,218
<i>When you see that I'm close,
you have to call the cryogenics company.</i>

149
00:10:45,343 --> 00:10:46,770
<i>Any time, 24/7.</i>

150
00:10:47,352 --> 00:10:50,232
<i>But you have to time it right, Sean.</i>
<i>I'm counting on you.</i>

151
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,441
He's ready.

152
00:10:53,396 --> 00:10:55,362
<i>The standby team
will come to the house,</i>

153
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,747
pack me in ice
to prevent ischemic damage,

154
00:10:57,872 --> 00:10:59,866
<i>and transport me
to a storage location.</i>

155
00:11:00,729 --> 00:11:03,537
<i>They'll prepare me,
then place me in my cryostat.</i>

156
00:11:04,527 --> 00:11:06,470
<i>The liquid nitrogen
will freeze my body</i>

157
00:11:06,595 --> 00:11:08,545
<i>and put me
in a state of suspended animation.</i>

158
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:10,419
<i>My cells, still rich with oxygen.</i>

159
00:11:10,786 --> 00:11:13,797
<i>My cancer will be frozen,
unable to multiply.</i>

160
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,018
A troysicle!

161
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:30,438
I tell you what. Is jabba the hut
gonna hang you on his wall?

162
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:35,235
I'm serious about this.

163
00:11:35,419 --> 00:11:39,114
Think about all the advancements
they've made in cancer research.

164
00:11:39,463 --> 00:11:42,200
10, 20 years from now,
they'll have got a cure.

165
00:11:42,543 --> 00:11:44,870
- And then what?
- And then they'll revive me.

166
00:11:48,123 --> 00:11:49,723
<i>Make me healthy again.</i>

167
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:53,587
Dad?

168
00:11:56,277 --> 00:11:58,550
<i>I'll be able to see
Wilber go to college.</i>

169
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,773
I'll be able to play
with Matt's kids.

170
00:12:01,898 --> 00:12:03,298
Our grandchildren.

171
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,104
This is why you haven't helped me
with the wedding?

172
00:12:09,793 --> 00:12:10,793


173
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:13,940
I understand
that you're afraid of dying.

174
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:16,105
We are all afraid of you dying

175
00:12:16,682 --> 00:12:18,945
and what life is going to be
without you,

176
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:22,813
but is there any scientific evidence
that this procedure works?

177
00:12:23,144 --> 00:12:25,202
And what effect do you think
liquid nitrogen

178
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,538
at a temperature close to absolute 0
is gonna have on your skin?

179
00:12:28,663 --> 00:12:30,415
How much is all this going to cost?

180
00:12:33,004 --> 00:12:36,129
There's a $200,000 initiation fee
and it's 5 grand a month after that.

181
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:37,310


182
00:12:37,435 --> 00:12:39,979
You got any better suggestions
of how I should spend my money?

183
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:43,668
Maybe leave it to the people
who are gonna still be alive?

184
00:12:47,795 --> 00:12:50,045
You are such a spoiled little dick.

185
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,437
Is that all you care about?
My money?

186
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,232
- No, Christian.
- I mean, no, that's fine.

187
00:12:57,598 --> 00:13:00,529
Take it. Here you go.
Here's 20. Another one.

188
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,790
Here you go. Take that. Have it.
Take it all. Here you go.

189
00:13:03,915 --> 00:13:05,784
Look at all this money you can have.

190
00:13:05,983 --> 00:13:08,118
Is this enough money for you?
You little dick!

191
00:13:08,243 --> 00:13:09,416
- Look.
- Take it all.

192
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:15,043
It's amazing, man. Even dying
doesn't make you any less of an asshole.

193
00:13:15,168 --> 00:13:16,128
But it's good.

194
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:29,258
What are you doing?

195
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:31,601
I'm meeting with an ice sculptor.

196
00:13:33,518 --> 00:13:35,313
Would you please
talk him out of this?

197
00:13:44,232 --> 00:13:47,532
You know, any time you spend
searching for immortality,

198
00:13:48,225 --> 00:13:50,704
you miss out on a little bit
you actually have left.

199
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,544
Just come to the place
and see it with me.

200
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:18,148
Sorry I'm late.

201
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:19,366
No excuses.

202
00:14:19,819 --> 00:14:20,817
Just sorry.

203
00:14:21,382 --> 00:14:23,232
At least you're consistent.

204
00:14:25,425 --> 00:14:26,409
If you're ready?

205
00:14:27,674 --> 00:14:28,575
Yeah.

206
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:30,076
Hit it, Linda.

207
00:15:25,822 --> 00:15:28,884
- Sean, I know that you're mad at...
- If you want out, just say it.

208
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,305
Don't make me wait for you with a...

209
00:15:31,425 --> 00:15:33,669
wok full of burnt stir fry
and half-lit candles.

210
00:15:33,794 --> 00:15:36,020
Don't make me feel more like a fool
than I already do.

211
00:15:36,215 --> 00:15:39,729
My not showing up is not a comment
on the evening's entertainment.

212
00:15:42,343 --> 00:15:43,493
My aunt died.

213
00:15:44,122 --> 00:15:45,347
We were close.

214
00:15:45,472 --> 00:15:47,240
Did your cell phone die along
with her?

215
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:52,699
I am sorry if my first thought
wasn't about you, Sean.

216
00:15:52,856 --> 00:15:55,011
It's been overwhelming.
I had to fly to Houston

217
00:15:55,136 --> 00:15:57,933
and identify the body,
make funeral arrangements.

218
00:15:58,058 --> 00:15:59,695
I've been a wreck.

219
00:16:04,895 --> 00:16:05,895
I'm sorry.

220
00:16:08,268 --> 00:16:09,426
I'm sorry, too.

221
00:16:12,901 --> 00:16:15,849
Why don't we try it again tonight?

222
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,820
I'll make you
one of her famous dishes

223
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,173
And you can be dessert.

224
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:29,838
- Hello.
- Hi.

225
00:16:31,468 --> 00:16:35,055
Could you put her in the playpen,
please, and give me a hand?

226
00:16:36,053 --> 00:16:37,245
Hey, beautiful.

227
00:16:38,093 --> 00:16:39,973
You know it's not
my day to watch her.

228
00:16:40,098 --> 00:16:42,433
I know. I'm not dropping her off
for you to watch her.

229
00:16:42,558 --> 00:16:45,829
She's gonna move in with you,
but just for, like, 2 weeks, OK?

230
00:16:45,954 --> 00:16:49,032
And I have her high chair in the car,
so will you come get it?

231
00:16:49,157 --> 00:16:50,357
Wait a minute.

232
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:51,885
Move in?

233
00:16:54,262 --> 00:16:56,380
Yeah.
Do you have a problem with that?

234
00:16:56,505 --> 00:16:58,055
She is your daughter.

235
00:16:59,867 --> 00:17:01,441
Well, wait a minute. Look.

236
00:17:01,566 --> 00:17:04,493
You can't just barge in here
and expect me to drop everything.

237
00:17:04,618 --> 00:17:05,982
Matt, please.

238
00:17:08,366 --> 00:17:10,047
Ram kicked me out, OK?

239
00:17:10,172 --> 00:17:13,571
So, I don't have a place to live
and I need to find an apartment,

240
00:17:13,696 --> 00:17:17,243
and the good ones, they don't like it
when you bring the little squealer.

241
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,690
He really kick you out?

242
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:27,945
He said I was too old.

243
00:17:32,775 --> 00:17:34,344
Do you think I look too old?

244
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,145
I think you're beautiful.

245
00:17:47,268 --> 00:17:49,518
You've always been beautiful to me.

246
00:17:55,087 --> 00:17:56,337
I have an idea.

247
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,535
Why don't we get a place together?

248
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:00,994
The 3 of us, like a family.

249
00:18:03,477 --> 00:18:05,761
Matt, are you on meth again?

250
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:08,044
Because you're acting high.

251
00:18:08,269 --> 00:18:09,269
Come on.

252
00:18:09,918 --> 00:18:12,446
Because I don't have a place to live,
you think I don't have a life

253
00:18:12,566 --> 00:18:13,666
or a future?

254
00:18:14,488 --> 00:18:17,703
- Now, will you go get her high chair?
- No, I can't go get her high chair.

255
00:18:17,828 --> 00:18:20,020
And you know what?
Jenna can't stay here.

256
00:18:20,145 --> 00:18:21,975
- Why?
- Christian's getting married.

257
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:24,071
There's a lot of things happening.

258
00:18:24,196 --> 00:18:26,479
What do you mean,
Christian's getting married? To who?

259
00:18:26,604 --> 00:18:27,604
To liz.

260
00:18:30,217 --> 00:18:31,250
Dyke liz?

261
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:32,625
OK. You're high.

262
00:18:33,644 --> 00:18:36,573
The invitation's on the counter
if you want to take a look.

263
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,067
Liz and Christian?

264
00:18:49,696 --> 00:18:50,696
Why?

265
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:55,843
He's dying, Kimber.

266
00:18:57,393 --> 00:19:00,243
The cancer came back.
He's got maybe 6 months.

267
00:19:03,126 --> 00:19:05,935
You know, Liz has really been there

268
00:19:06,786 --> 00:19:09,536
and she wants to take care of him,
you know?

269
00:19:10,011 --> 00:19:11,111
Before he...

270
00:19:17,894 --> 00:19:19,494
So, he's really dying?

271
00:19:29,426 --> 00:19:32,166
The main difference in texas chili

272
00:19:32,694 --> 00:19:34,672
is that it doesn't have beans.

273
00:19:37,369 --> 00:19:38,384
Oh, jesus.

274
00:19:40,824 --> 00:19:41,763
I'm on fire!

275
00:19:44,755 --> 00:19:46,309
Aunt dot always said

276
00:19:46,712 --> 00:19:50,230
that it was always
about the chili pepper.

277
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,973
Maybe that's what killed her.

278
00:19:54,574 --> 00:19:55,574
Sorry.

279
00:19:56,233 --> 00:19:58,034
- That was pretty...
- Funny.

280
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:00,150
Funny. Actually.

281
00:20:01,195 --> 00:20:03,745
My aunt had
such a great sense of humor.

282
00:20:04,142 --> 00:20:07,898
She accepted that no man
was ever going to be there for her,

283
00:20:08,023 --> 00:20:10,750
so she decided
that she would be there for herself.

284
00:20:11,383 --> 00:20:15,220
And that being alone didn't mean being
lonely and miserable,

285
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:19,735
and that no man
was ever going to hurt her

286
00:20:21,194 --> 00:20:23,444
or take away her spirit ever again.

287
00:20:30,247 --> 00:20:31,847
You know, I have to...

288
00:20:32,222 --> 00:20:35,504
call Liz and tell her
that I can't make it to the wedding

289
00:20:35,629 --> 00:20:37,569
because
it's the same day as the funeral.

290
00:20:37,854 --> 00:20:40,726
- You want me to come with you?
- No, Sean.

291
00:20:43,133 --> 00:20:45,577
Christian is your best friend
and he needs you.

292
00:20:49,507 --> 00:20:51,807
Life trumps death every time, right?

293
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:57,079
You can be vulnerable with me.

294
00:20:58,698 --> 00:21:00,498
- Come here.
- Thank you.

295
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:06,924
I appreciate that, but right now,
I do not want to bring us down.

296
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:09,370
I want to bring us up.

297
00:21:18,392 --> 00:21:20,792
Hold that thought.
Hold that thought.

298
00:21:34,231 --> 00:21:35,541
Oh, my god.

299
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,730
Do you need that to get off with me?

300
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:44,059
No.

301
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,684
It just heightens the orgasm.

302
00:22:00,729 --> 00:22:01,729
What?

303
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:04,113
I just think
it's a little dangerous.

304
00:22:06,394 --> 00:22:09,804
I am an expert
in N2O's anesthetic effects.

305
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:11,454
I know what I'm doing.

306
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:16,165
You have your 2 glasses of wine
to get high.

307
00:22:17,895 --> 00:22:19,128
And I have this.

308
00:22:33,005 --> 00:22:34,505
What's it feel like?

309
00:22:35,894 --> 00:22:37,146
There's no pain.

310
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:40,931
It's pure escape.

311
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,380
There's no peer pressure here, Sean.

312
00:22:56,206 --> 00:22:58,146
You don't have to prove anything.

313
00:22:58,271 --> 00:23:00,621
I know who you are
and I accept that.

314
00:23:02,019 --> 00:23:04,069
Just like I hope you accept me.

315
00:23:38,273 --> 00:23:41,544
I'd only eat half of that
if you want to fit into your dress.

316
00:23:42,323 --> 00:23:46,007
- It's an old modeling trick of mine.
- My gown is custom made.

317
00:23:46,376 --> 00:23:49,093
And I thought you didn't wear
any clothes in most of your modeling.

318
00:23:53,075 --> 00:23:56,156
When I heard about
Christian's upcoming wedding to you,

319
00:23:56,281 --> 00:23:59,219
I started to feel a bit nostalgic.

320
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:03,566
Do you rember
when I had my first surgery in Miami?

321
00:24:03,873 --> 00:24:05,962
You warned me about Christian.

322
00:24:06,087 --> 00:24:07,686
You told me he was no good,

323
00:24:07,811 --> 00:24:11,741
I was just one in a long line of girls
he had screwed and screwed over.

324
00:24:12,212 --> 00:24:13,910
- What's your point?
- My point is,

325
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:18,180
you were wrong about him and I then
and you're wrong about us now.

326
00:24:19,273 --> 00:24:21,081
He doesn't love you, Liz.

327
00:24:21,206 --> 00:24:24,921
I'm sure he loves
the idea of you playing nursemaid,

328
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:27,319
but...

329
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:31,385
I'm the one he really loves.

330
00:24:31,832 --> 00:24:33,332
You are so pathetic.

331
00:24:41,296 --> 00:24:42,480
Who's pathetic?

332
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:45,816
The woman who's marrying a man
because he's dying

333
00:24:46,579 --> 00:24:50,279
or the one he closes his eyes and
thinks about while he's screwing you?

334
00:24:54,855 --> 00:24:55,993
Wait a second.

335
00:25:02,691 --> 00:25:05,077
You don't have to marry him, Liz.

336
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:07,714
I will. I'll take care of him.

337
00:25:08,028 --> 00:25:10,322
Christian is gonna be
100 pounds in 3 months,

338
00:25:10,447 --> 00:25:12,572
and he's gonna need somebody
to wipe his ass.

339
00:25:12,697 --> 00:25:16,588
I'm sure you're a wizard at oral sex,
but do you think you're up to that?

340
00:25:16,713 --> 00:25:17,431
Yes!

341
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:21,450
This is my chance to redeem myself
with him. I love him, Liz.

342
00:25:22,151 --> 00:25:24,251
I always have and I always will.

343
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,608
I'm on to you, sweetie.

344
00:25:27,874 --> 00:25:30,220
Matt told me
about Eden and the pander

345
00:25:30,345 --> 00:25:32,488
who threw you out
on your bleached little ass.

346
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,194
You don't want Christian.

347
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:36,242
You want
the warm embrace of his wallet.

348
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:37,825
Are you so vapid,

349
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:40,753
are you so unable
to make it on your own?

350
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:44,267
That you would sink your fangs
into a dying man

351
00:25:45,591 --> 00:25:49,595
Well, I am not gonna let you suck
one more drop of blood from him.

352
00:25:51,572 --> 00:25:53,009
This isn't over, butch.

353
00:25:56,227 --> 00:25:59,052
If you come near me or my fiance,

354
00:25:59,716 --> 00:26:03,019
I'm gonna show you
just how butch I can get.

355
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:12,028
<i>Dr. Troy,
are you ready to see your future?</i>

356
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,739
I thought it would be bigger.

357
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:37,720
The hardware is
still extremely expensive,

358
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:41,222
and though you and I agree that
this is the ticket to extending life,

359
00:26:41,347 --> 00:26:45,061
The clientele with the forethought
and financial wherewithal is limited.

360
00:26:45,841 --> 00:26:46,941
Now, doctor,

361
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,130
here's your portal.

362
00:26:49,578 --> 00:26:51,910
The AZ-6294.

363
00:26:52,284 --> 00:26:53,611
It's one of our newest.

364
00:26:57,031 --> 00:26:59,533
Christian,
you might want to see this.

365
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:13,950
- There's an old jewish guy in my tank.
- Yes, there's someone in every tank.

366
00:27:14,075 --> 00:27:15,725
We're at full capacity.

367
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:17,719
Dr. Troy,

368
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,470
meet Herb Schlansky.

369
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,530
- He's your eternity roommate.
- No.

370
00:27:23,592 --> 00:27:25,768
I want my own tank. I'll pay more.

371
00:27:26,374 --> 00:27:28,429
Don't you have
like a one bedroom or something?

372
00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:32,120
No. That's not possible.
As I said, we're at full capacity.

373
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,716
There was nothing in your literature
about sharing a tank.

374
00:27:35,841 --> 00:27:38,659
What if they find a cure for him first
and they have to thaw him.

375
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,446
How do they keep me frozen?

376
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:45,010
I'm sure we'll figure something out.

377
00:27:49,637 --> 00:27:51,718
I didn't even like it
with you as a roommate.

378
00:27:51,843 --> 00:27:54,469
- What the hell was I thinking?
- You're scared.

379
00:27:54,594 --> 00:27:56,838
You're reaching out
for some phantom hand

380
00:27:56,963 --> 00:27:58,843
to keep you
from falling into the abyss.

381
00:27:59,546 --> 00:28:02,530
It's normal. It's just...
not going to make any difference.

382
00:28:02,655 --> 00:28:05,508
I've lived my life like
I've had some kind of death wish.

383
00:28:05,633 --> 00:28:07,702
I mean, drug abuse,

384
00:28:08,205 --> 00:28:10,646
unsafe sex.
I drink vodka like it's water.

385
00:28:11,725 --> 00:28:13,970
If I could fit into a Gucci suit
without working out,

386
00:28:14,095 --> 00:28:15,943
I'd never step inside a gym.

387
00:28:18,685 --> 00:28:19,685
And now?

388
00:28:22,598 --> 00:28:23,598
Now...

389
00:28:27,721 --> 00:28:29,371
I don't want to go yet.

390
00:28:32,588 --> 00:28:33,588
Come here.

391
00:28:38,145 --> 00:28:40,995
Christian,
all you need to understand right now

392
00:28:41,695 --> 00:28:44,054
is
that you're never really going to die.

393
00:28:44,529 --> 00:28:48,383
And it's not because of our practice
that we've built up or a son we raised.

394
00:28:49,742 --> 00:28:51,092
It's the stories.

395
00:28:53,029 --> 00:28:54,029
Right?

396
00:28:54,154 --> 00:28:57,504
I'm gonna be telling
Christian Troy stories for decades.

397
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,610
You'll live on forever...

398
00:29:00,841 --> 00:29:01,941
through me.

399
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:09,929
- Now, come on. Buy me lunch.
- No, I gotta...

400
00:29:10,656 --> 00:29:14,106
I gotta head back to the office
and start writing my vows.

401
00:29:21,374 --> 00:29:23,629
"I've done a lot of things
I'm not proud of in my life,

402
00:29:23,749 --> 00:29:25,721
"but proposing to you
isn't one of them."

403
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,339
Oh, for god's sake.

404
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,596
{\- Hey.
- Hey.}

405
00:29:41,721 --> 00:29:44,216
- You gotta help me out here.
- Listen to this gibran poem.

406
00:29:44,341 --> 00:29:47,141
I think I'm gonna use it.
It's so beautiful. 

407
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:50,852
"Love one another
make not a bond of love... "

408
00:29:50,977 --> 00:29:52,719
Lizzie, honey, surprise me, OK?

409
00:29:52,844 --> 00:29:55,087
I'm the one who needs the help here.
This is not my thing.

410
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:57,000
<i>Writing wedding vows.</i>

411
00:30:00,472 --> 00:30:01,882
Just make it simple

412
00:30:02,137 --> 00:30:04,722
<i>and heartfelt.</i> <i>You know?</i>

413
00:30:05,217 --> 00:30:06,967
Just one simple sentence.

414
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:09,098
<i>That's all you need.</i>

415
00:31:32,425 --> 00:31:34,225
We couldn't help ourselves.

416
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:38,521
On the contrary.
You helped yourselves and then some.

417
00:31:40,417 --> 00:31:42,017
It's like we're dying.

418
00:31:42,486 --> 00:31:45,174
Like...
We're corpses without the blood.

419
00:31:46,383 --> 00:31:49,323
I get it, I get it.
You want to live forever.

420
00:31:50,716 --> 00:31:53,016
- Are you going to report us?
- No.

421
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:54,978
Last call, though.

422
00:31:56,078 --> 00:31:58,460
One more for the road,
then get your scary asses out of here.

423
00:32:10,652 --> 00:32:11,652
Oh, baby.

424
00:32:11,777 --> 00:32:13,715
I hope we don't get a walk-in.

425
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,013
It's only 3:00 a.m.

426
00:32:16,681 --> 00:32:19,895
Baby, if you want to play doctor,
you can't be one all the time.

427
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,080
I'll tell you what I want to be.

428
00:32:23,704 --> 00:32:26,587
Way down south in Dixie.

429
00:32:31,268 --> 00:32:33,600
Let me air out before you go down.

430
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:37,546
That's it, baby.

431
00:32:38,609 --> 00:32:40,249
Take it in, honey.

432
00:32:43,344 --> 00:32:44,794
Now, give me some. 

433
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:48,923
'Cause you know
how hard it makes my dick.

434
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:52,708
- And don't be stingy with it.
- Come on, baby. Lie down on the table.

435
00:32:59,556 --> 00:33:01,056
- Ready?
- Oh, god.

436
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,146
Give it to me, baby.

437
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,744


438
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:07,276
Yes.

439
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:19,738
That's it, darling.

440
00:33:20,548 --> 00:33:21,798
Take it all in.

441
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,966
Oh! What are you doing?

442
00:33:34,644 --> 00:33:35,596
God.

443
00:33:56,383 --> 00:33:57,583
You poor fool.

444
00:33:59,167 --> 00:34:01,667
Why'd you have to fall in love
with me?

445
00:34:14,103 --> 00:34:15,670
- What the?
- Here.

446
00:34:17,248 --> 00:34:20,273
Let me. You'd think
you'd never been through this before.

447
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:22,848
Yeah,
we all know how that turned out.

448
00:34:23,805 --> 00:34:26,643
Guess we know
how this one will turn out, too, huh?

449
00:34:26,768 --> 00:34:29,005
And
they all lived happily ever after

450
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:30,730
for at least 6 months.

451
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:36,002
You don't have to do this.

452
00:34:36,127 --> 00:34:38,242
- I'll be there for you.
- I know.

453
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:42,260
This is right. I love Lizzie.
She's a great girl.

454
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:44,573
She's great with Wilber.

455
00:34:45,318 --> 00:34:47,793
I have to think about the future,
you know. How about you?

456
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:49,378
What do you mean?

457
00:34:49,547 --> 00:34:52,042
Am I gonna leave this world
with you a confirmed bachelor,

458
00:34:52,167 --> 00:34:54,133
or are you gonna seal the deal
with teddy?

459
00:34:54,487 --> 00:34:57,319
Who the hell knows?
She's been away so much lately.

460
00:34:57,444 --> 00:34:59,151
Well, look at the bright side,

461
00:34:59,276 --> 00:35:01,268
she's probably got enough
frequent flyer points

462
00:35:01,867 --> 00:35:03,937
to send the two of you
to the great barrier reef.

463
00:35:06,887 --> 00:35:07,771
It's time.

464
00:35:14,728 --> 00:35:15,728
Come here.

465
00:35:21,092 --> 00:35:22,202
You were right,

466
00:35:22,463 --> 00:35:23,833
I was an asshole.

467
00:35:24,392 --> 00:35:25,392
I'm sorry.

468
00:35:26,267 --> 00:35:27,617
I got at least...

469
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:31,185
2 months to figure that stuff out,
right?

470
00:35:32,048 --> 00:35:33,048
Yeah.

471
00:35:41,568 --> 00:35:44,418
You two ready
to get me to the church on time?

472
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,144
Yeah?

473
00:35:57,814 --> 00:36:01,064
- You invited Kimber?
- She didn't need an invitation.

474
00:36:01,481 --> 00:36:03,936
It's a church, they welcome everybody,
especially whores.

475
00:36:04,061 --> 00:36:05,661
It's big in the bible.

476
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:08,499
Sorry.

477
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,112
Linda, do I look like a bride?

478
00:36:39,554 --> 00:36:42,004
You look gorgeous.
Just start walking.

479
00:36:55,496 --> 00:36:57,146
Would you look at that?

480
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,020
"Father,

481
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:16,559
"you have made
the bond of marriage a holy mystery,

482
00:37:16,684 --> 00:37:19,334
"a symbol
of Christ's love for his church."

483
00:37:22,276 --> 00:37:23,976
"You were born together,

484
00:37:24,429 --> 00:37:26,979
"and together
you shall be forever more."

485
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:29,205
"You shall be together

486
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:32,845
"when the white wings of death
scatter your days."

487
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:45,852
Liz Cruz,

488
00:37:47,183 --> 00:37:50,136
I will love you
for the rest of my life.

489
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,169
If any person here can show
just and sufficient reason

490
00:37:59,294 --> 00:38:02,844
why these 2 persons
may not be joined together in matrimony,

491
00:38:03,303 --> 00:38:05,365
let them declare their reasons now

492
00:38:05,704 --> 00:38:08,717
or from this time forward,
keep their peace.

493
00:38:21,594 --> 00:38:22,594
Sit down!

494
00:38:37,437 --> 00:38:38,987
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

495
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:53,994
By the authority vested in me
by the State of California,

496
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,722
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

497
00:40:45,045 --> 00:40:47,732
- I'm gonna eat spaghetti.
- You are?

498
00:40:48,089 --> 00:40:51,306
That sounds good to me.
So, how do you say...

499
00:40:51,936 --> 00:40:53,806
- "ice cream" in italian?
- Gelato.

500
00:40:53,931 --> 00:40:55,827
Gelato? You're too good.

501
00:40:56,006 --> 00:40:57,006
High-Five.

502
00:40:59,191 --> 00:41:00,957
Is everybody ready and zipped?

503
00:41:01,131 --> 00:41:03,573
Are these the books
you want to take with you on the plane?

504
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:05,003
All right.

505
00:41:05,214 --> 00:41:07,884
Hubby, are we gonna have to pay extra
for your luggage?

506
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:12,010
. While you guys are out eating gelato,
I'm gonna shop for a whole new wardrobe.

507
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:13,944
Can I call you mommy now?

508
00:41:16,951 --> 00:41:17,933
Yes, you can.

509
00:41:18,739 --> 00:41:20,099
Yes, you can.

510
00:41:24,171 --> 00:41:25,335
But we got to hurry up.

511
00:41:25,455 --> 00:41:28,705
We got only 5 minutes to go
before they come.Let's go.

512
00:41:34,947 --> 00:41:36,447
- Yeah?
- Dr. Troy,

513
00:41:36,805 --> 00:41:38,488
- this is dr. Moss.
- Hello, doc.

514
00:41:38,613 --> 00:41:41,012
I know you're disappointed
that I'm not doing anymore treatments,

515
00:41:41,132 --> 00:41:43,060
but here's the deal,
I just got married

516
00:41:43,185 --> 00:41:45,669
and I'm on my way to my honeymoon
in less than 5 minutes.

517
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:48,537
Actually,
I'm calling about something else.

518
00:41:49,508 --> 00:41:51,112
<i>Because of the new hepa laws,</i>

519
00:41:51,237 --> 00:41:53,513
we've been using patient I.D. numbers
instead of names.

520
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:56,178
When another patient,
Mrs. Glendening,

521
00:41:56,918 --> 00:41:59,369
surprised us
with an unexpected downturn this week,

522
00:41:59,494 --> 00:42:01,922
<i>we rechecked her blood work.</i>

523
00:42:02,258 --> 00:42:03,470
Cut to the chase, doc.

524
00:42:03,595 --> 00:42:06,356
What, am I gonna kick the bucket
sooner than I thought?

525
00:42:06,481 --> 00:42:07,948
Our lab tech...

526
00:42:08,818 --> 00:42:12,136
inadvertently
switched your I.D. numbers.

527
00:42:12,749 --> 00:42:15,749
Your results were labeled as hers
and vice versa.

528
00:42:17,508 --> 00:42:18,664
Long story short,

529
00:42:19,533 --> 00:42:21,496
Mrs. Glendening's bad news...

530
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:23,704
<i>is your good fortune.</i>

531
00:42:23,829 --> 00:42:26,279
<i>Your cancer is in remission,
Dr. Troy.</i>

532
00:42:27,809 --> 00:42:31,506
<i>I wish you and your bride
a long and happy life together.</i>

533
00:42:32,489 --> 00:42:34,189
Christian, they're here.

534
00:42:35,023 --> 00:42:37,273
Can you call him back from the car?
