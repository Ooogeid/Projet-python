1
00:00:00,215 --> 00:00:01,942
What about if I gave you a ring?

2
00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:04,161
It came from mike's heart,

3
00:00:04,281 --> 00:00:06,668
And I don't think you
really have one.

4
00:00:06,788 --> 00:00:09,565
I do have one,
and it belongs to you.

5
00:00:09,889 --> 00:00:11,206
It always has.

6
00:00:11,703 --> 00:00:14,639
Turn around, walk with
your back towards us.

7
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:17,141
Your son's doing just fine.
He sends his love.

8
00:00:17,261 --> 00:00:18,837
Where is matt?
I want to see matt.

9
00:00:18,957 --> 00:00:20,701
Don't worry,
I'm taking good care of him.

10
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:23,005
You gotta help me!
Please!

11
00:00:28,231 --> 00:00:30,809
Tell me what you don't like
about yourself, Mrs., uh...

12
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:32,341
Special agent Thomas.

13
00:00:32,461 --> 00:00:34,782
I'm from the district
attorney's office.

14
00:00:36,664 --> 00:00:38,204
So what can we do for you?

15
00:00:38,324 --> 00:00:41,824
I want you to suck the fat out of
a murdering piece of scum...

16
00:00:41,944 --> 00:00:43,634
so we can kill him.

17
00:00:45,204 --> 00:00:46,392
Wesley Clovis.

18
00:00:46,512 --> 00:00:48,779
He's due to be executed
in 2 weeks.

19
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:53,099
"His weight increases the risk
that the correct dose of thiopental...

20
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:57,388
cannot be determined and he will
therefore not be properly anesthetized."

21
00:00:57,508 --> 00:00:58,422
Bullshit.

22
00:00:58,542 --> 00:01:01,625
Some kid over at the public defender's
office wants to play tv lawyer...

23
00:01:01,745 --> 00:01:03,591
and he throws the eighth
amendment at us.

24
00:01:03,711 --> 00:01:05,905
"Experts agree if the first
drug doesn't work,...

25
00:01:06,025 --> 00:01:08,209
the execution could be excruciating."

26
00:01:08,329 --> 00:01:11,457
It took 3 hours for that sick
bastard to rape and torture...

27
00:01:11,577 --> 00:01:13,081
a 17-year-old girl...

28
00:01:13,201 --> 00:01:16,562
and now he's using cruel and unusual
punishment to get off? Come on.

29
00:01:16,682 --> 00:01:19,280
- Court's never gonna buy this.
- Really?

30
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,709
Now why is that?

31
00:01:20,829 --> 00:01:22,496
Because it's unjust?

32
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:25,372
Come on, doctors, we live
by the rule of law.

33
00:01:25,492 --> 00:01:28,890
And the law states that
execution by lethal injection...

34
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:32,639
be of sufficient dosage to quickly
and painlessly cause death.

35
00:01:33,204 --> 00:01:37,314
But someone Clovis' size,
we can't absolutely guarantee that.

36
00:01:46,743 --> 00:01:50,454
The only way to make sure
that the execution goes properly...

37
00:01:50,574 --> 00:01:53,494
is if he sheds some
of that blubber, pronto.

38
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:56,963
So you picked us to give him
liposuction and a tummy tuck,

39
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:59,682
out of all of the plastic
surgeons in the state?

40
00:01:59,802 --> 00:02:01,468
In exchange for your services,

41
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:04,161
the D.A.'s willing to shorten
your son's prison term.

42
00:02:04,281 --> 00:02:08,163
- He could be up for parole in...
- No, no, no. If you want our help...

43
00:02:08,283 --> 00:02:10,093
Matt gets out now.
Period.

44
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:11,213
Christian...

45
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:14,841
Well, I believe I can convince the
district attorney to consider your offer.

46
00:02:14,961 --> 00:02:18,388
We need to discuss this,
if you don't mind, in private.

47
00:02:20,924 --> 00:02:22,869
Oh, sure.
Listen...

48
00:02:23,531 --> 00:02:25,900
Sooner or later,
Clovis is fish food.

49
00:02:26,265 --> 00:02:27,765
Now the only issue is...

50
00:02:27,885 --> 00:02:30,859
whether he gets to stuff his face
for another 15 years...

51
00:02:30,979 --> 00:02:34,485
while his appeal winds its way
through the courts.

52
00:02:35,132 --> 00:02:37,820
Your son's still young, doctor.

53
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:42,288
Isn't his life worth more than
that of an unrepentant murderer?

00:03:42,645 --> 00:03:43,795
What's this?

59
00:03:43,915 --> 00:03:47,769
This, my bombay baby,
is a chimango martini,

60
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:50,522
One of my new
brilliant inventions.

61
00:03:51,417 --> 00:03:53,310
Mmm.
It's good.

62
00:03:54,156 --> 00:03:55,565
Where's Wilber?

63
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,666
He had another little accident.

64
00:03:59,024 --> 00:04:02,041
Jesus. And I'm spending what,
275 a session,

65
00:04:02,161 --> 00:04:05,059
which I can't afford,
on this charlatan kiddie shrink,

66
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:07,245
and he's still pissing
in his bed.

67
00:04:07,365 --> 00:04:08,491
You know what they do together?

68
00:04:08,611 --> 00:04:09,934
Do you have any idea
what they do together?

69
00:04:10,054 --> 00:04:11,575
They play candyland.
Candyland!

70
00:04:11,695 --> 00:04:14,085
Honey, he's fine.
I changed his sheets,

71
00:04:14,205 --> 00:04:16,775
I read him a story.
He's sleeping like a little lamb.

72
00:04:16,895 --> 00:04:21,113
I want you to enjoy your drink
because I'm serving you dinner.

73
00:04:22,648 --> 00:04:23,560
Ok.

74
00:04:24,538 --> 00:04:26,726
What's going on, Kimmie, huh?

75
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,650
You tired of driving
that old camry,

76
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,589
you got your eyes on
a porsche or something?

77
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:33,299
I am expanding
my culinary horizons.

78
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:36,654
It's called making
an effort, Christian.

79
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,682
I'm pregnant, Christian.

80
00:04:58,872 --> 00:05:01,052
I don't want any more kids,
Kimber.

81
00:05:01,172 --> 00:05:02,919
I can't afford any more kids, ok?

82
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,109
Emotionally or financially.
I want things to get easier, not harder.

83
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:08,589
I understand.
But sometimes...

84
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:13,063
Unexpected things happen for
a reason, and you love kids.

85
00:05:13,183 --> 00:05:14,849
I'm 45 years old, ok?

86
00:05:14,969 --> 00:05:16,217
I already got 3 kids.

87
00:05:16,285 --> 00:05:18,873
Frankly, my dear,...

88
00:05:19,359 --> 00:05:21,828
Parenting is not your long suit.

89
00:05:22,176 --> 00:05:24,119
You know,
that grandchild of mine,

90
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:28,300
she already is showing signs
of becoming a world-class spoiled brat.

91
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,764
Come here.

92
00:05:34,046 --> 00:05:35,156
Come here.

93
00:05:38,076 --> 00:05:40,161
You just have to
make up your mind.

94
00:05:40,281 --> 00:05:42,682
A check for
its schooling, or me.

95
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,224
It's not an "it", Christian.

96
00:05:47,344 --> 00:05:48,684
You can't have both.

97
00:05:48,804 --> 00:05:52,025
Why can't you just say
you'll sleep on it?

98
00:05:53,709 --> 00:05:54,870
Please?

99
00:05:59,765 --> 00:06:01,770
You cooked this shit
for nothing.

100
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,650
Happy birthday to you,

101
00:06:11,131 --> 00:06:13,626
Happy birthday to you,

102
00:06:13,891 --> 00:06:17,345
Happy sweet sixteen,
Amy and Tina...

103
00:06:17,602 --> 00:06:19,103
Thank you, Dr. Mcnamara,

104
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,344
That's enough.
You can stop the singing.

105
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,403
And can you lose the hats?
We're not babies.

106
00:06:23,523 --> 00:06:25,010
We look ridiculous.

107
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,244
That's 'cause mom keeps
treating us like we're four.

108
00:06:27,364 --> 00:06:29,568
I know. You know, amy popped
her cherry when she was 12...

109
00:06:29,688 --> 00:06:31,968
and I've been having an affair
with my homeroom teacher...

110
00:06:32,088 --> 00:06:33,144
for almost 6 weeks.

111
00:06:33,264 --> 00:06:34,261
We're not babies.

112
00:06:34,381 --> 00:06:36,527
He's gonna miss having that
rhino schnozz up his ass.

113
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:39,798
- Ok, that's enough. I'll take that.
- We about ready here?

114
00:06:40,196 --> 00:06:41,797
Let's count back from 100.

115
00:06:41,917 --> 00:06:42,619
Ok.

116
00:06:42,739 --> 00:06:44,593
100, 99, 98...

117
00:06:51,748 --> 00:06:53,213
Good morning, Christian.

118
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:54,963
- So glad you could join us.
- Yeah.

119
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,637
What's so freakin'
good about it?

120
00:06:56,757 --> 00:07:00,254
Well, besides the celebration of the
Krumholtz twins' sweet sixteen,

121
00:07:00,374 --> 00:07:02,504
I slept much better
last night once I realized...

122
00:07:02,624 --> 00:07:05,148
we're not going to
give lipo to Mr. Clovis.

123
00:07:06,311 --> 00:07:07,599
The deal's off?

124
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:11,048
- Why'd they change their mind?
- They didn't. I did.

125
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,630
I called special agent Thomas
this morning and I told her...

126
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,507
we are not interested.

127
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,785
You'd rather see your son rot in prison
than help fry a child murderer?

128
00:07:20,905 --> 00:07:24,518
If anyone gets wind that we gave lipo
to a man just so he could be executed,

129
00:07:24,638 --> 00:07:27,733
we're going to be doing much worse
than two for one birthday nose jobs.

130
00:07:27,853 --> 00:07:29,832
You're such a selfish bastard,
do you know that?

131
00:07:29,952 --> 00:07:32,436
You're more worried about
your solid gold reputation...

132
00:07:32,556 --> 00:07:34,442
than you are
about your own son.

133
00:07:34,562 --> 00:07:37,405
Tell you what...
You can be the one to tell him.

134
00:07:48,148 --> 00:07:49,837
Oh! Jesus!

135
00:07:49,957 --> 00:07:52,424
Is everything in this
goddamn place expired?

136
00:07:52,544 --> 00:07:54,488
Your man thong's
on too tight?

137
00:07:54,952 --> 00:07:57,036
You've been in
a foul mood all day.

138
00:07:57,156 --> 00:07:58,846
Kimber's pregnant.

139
00:08:04,132 --> 00:08:05,468
Congratulations.

140
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:08,554
- Is it yours?
- Yes, of course it's mine.

141
00:08:08,674 --> 00:08:10,692
It's bullshit, that's what is.
She wants to keep it.

142
00:08:10,812 --> 00:08:12,879
I mean, can you believe
the balls on that chick?

143
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:14,297
You don't get it, do you?

144
00:08:14,365 --> 00:08:16,538
That's the only way she thinks
she can hold onto you.

145
00:08:16,658 --> 00:08:19,079
- She already has me.
- Nobody has you.

146
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,004
We can see you,
we can talk to you.

147
00:08:21,124 --> 00:08:22,739
But you don't let anybody in.

148
00:08:22,859 --> 00:08:26,638
It's the only guarantee that
Kimber has that you'll stick around.

149
00:08:41,662 --> 00:08:43,883
- Hey, dad.
- Hi!

150
00:08:47,413 --> 00:08:50,558
So, they let everyone have
full contact with family now?

151
00:08:50,678 --> 00:08:52,461
Are you kidding me?
No.

152
00:08:52,581 --> 00:08:54,781
But since you're doing
the operation on Wesley,

153
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,981
they've been treating me
a lot better in here.

154
00:08:57,101 --> 00:08:57,901
Really?

155
00:08:58,414 --> 00:09:01,062
Yeah, you have no idea, man.
You saved my life.

156
00:09:01,182 --> 00:09:03,406
Look,
when I get out of here,

157
00:09:03,526 --> 00:09:06,898
I promise, I'm going to bust
my ass to turn things around, ok?

158
00:09:07,018 --> 00:09:08,858
You're gonna see.
I owe you that much.

159
00:09:08,978 --> 00:09:09,898
Matt...

160
00:09:10,823 --> 00:09:13,856
I've decided I'm not going
to do the surgery.

161
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:18,156
I can't operate on a man just
so he can be put to death.

162
00:09:18,276 --> 00:09:20,675
I'm sorry. I wanted you
to hear it from me first.

163
00:09:20,795 --> 00:09:24,309
I thought--I thought you agreed
so that I could be released.

164
00:09:24,574 --> 00:09:28,663
No. And it still doesn't change
what I'm being asked to do,

165
00:09:28,783 --> 00:09:31,170
which is compromise
my ethics as a doctor.

166
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:32,350
Your ethics?!

167
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:35,085
You take an oath... when you
dedicate yourself to medicine,

168
00:09:35,205 --> 00:09:38,388
And the basis of that thing
I've built my life on is first,

169
00:09:38,508 --> 00:09:41,831
do no harm. I can't go against
everything I stand for...

170
00:09:41,951 --> 00:09:45,900
and risk my reputation right now,
even if it means keeping you here.

171
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,624
So what you're saying is,

172
00:09:47,744 --> 00:09:49,553
that pedophile,
that child rapist,

173
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:51,376
means more to you
then your own son.

174
00:09:51,496 --> 00:09:53,267
No, that is not
what I'm saying.

175
00:09:53,387 --> 00:09:55,494
No, I get it, man.
You don't give a shit about me.

176
00:09:55,614 --> 00:09:56,986
You haven't for a long time.

177
00:09:57,106 --> 00:09:59,037
I told you, I'm happy
to help with your appeal.

178
00:09:59,157 --> 00:10:01,560
My appeal?
I don't need an appeal.

179
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,741
What I want is to get
the hell out of here,

180
00:10:03,861 --> 00:10:05,513
and now you're telling me
I can't...

181
00:10:05,633 --> 00:10:08,331
because you won't do some stupid
surgery you do a hundred times a week.

182
00:10:08,451 --> 00:10:10,642
I'm tired of always being
asked to betray my beliefs...

183
00:10:10,762 --> 00:10:11,948
because of your bad decisions.

184
00:10:12,068 --> 00:10:13,788
How about the fact
that you belong here?

185
00:10:13,908 --> 00:10:16,511
You son of a bitch!
You are dead to me! You hear me?

186
00:10:16,631 --> 00:10:17,771
You are dead to me.

187
00:10:17,891 --> 00:10:19,709
I don't ever want
to see you in here again!

188
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:21,585
Don't ever come back, Sean!

189
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:24,274
You are dead to me!
You are dead!

190
00:10:32,014 --> 00:10:33,174
We're good?

191
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:38,481
Ok.
Let's get this over with, shall we?

192
00:10:49,534 --> 00:10:51,194
Is this gonna hurt?

193
00:10:51,691 --> 00:10:53,415
I don't like pain.

194
00:10:53,535 --> 00:10:55,205
It makes me dizzy.

195
00:10:56,725 --> 00:10:57,521
No.

196
00:10:58,526 --> 00:11:00,306
It's not gonna hurt.

197
00:11:08,365 --> 00:11:10,432
How about that girl
you murdered?

198
00:11:10,552 --> 00:11:13,470
Think she liked pain?
Think she got a little dizzy?

199
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,629
I didn't kill her.

200
00:11:14,749 --> 00:11:18,494
That's not what the jury thought.
Or the appeals court, or the governor.

201
00:11:18,614 --> 00:11:20,194
They... they're all wrong.

202
00:11:20,314 --> 00:11:22,274
- Because I didn't do it.
- Come on, Wes.

203
00:11:22,394 --> 00:11:24,596
She complained about you
peeping in her windows.

204
00:11:24,716 --> 00:11:27,813
They found your boot print
in her apartment, in her blood.

205
00:11:27,933 --> 00:11:29,446
Well, I shouldn't have peeped.

206
00:11:29,566 --> 00:11:32,357
I shouldn't have peeped,
but I didn't kill her.

207
00:11:33,981 --> 00:11:35,485
You know what, sling blade,

208
00:11:35,605 --> 00:11:38,850
that old-timey "I didn't do nothing"
hick shit just don't work for me.

209
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,054
I came home and her door...

210
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,816
was open, and I looked
inside to see if...

211
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:48,578
she was ok.
She was a nice girl.

212
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:50,991
Did you know dead bodies,

213
00:11:51,422 --> 00:11:53,547
They don't look like
they do on... on tv.

214
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:56,054
They look... rubbery.

215
00:11:58,681 --> 00:12:01,499
Like a picture, you know.
No soul.

216
00:12:03,387 --> 00:12:06,317
I got scared and I ran away.

217
00:12:06,437 --> 00:12:07,929
I know I should...

218
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:11,722
I know I shouldn't have.
I know I should have called the police.

219
00:12:11,842 --> 00:12:13,444
I know I messed up.

220
00:12:14,728 --> 00:12:17,420
- But I didn't kill her.
- Tell it to your priest.

221
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,326
I've been telling everyone.

222
00:12:19,446 --> 00:12:20,872
For 15 years.

223
00:12:21,883 --> 00:12:23,453
No one's listened.

224
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,408
Doesn't matter anymore.

225
00:12:27,005 --> 00:12:28,530
Done fighting.

226
00:12:30,485 --> 00:12:32,998
Time for... me to go.

227
00:12:33,296 --> 00:12:36,412
Then I guess I'm doing you a favor.
You're welcome.

228
00:12:39,782 --> 00:12:40,809
Do you...

229
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,527
Do you think dying hurts, doc?

230
00:12:44,621 --> 00:12:46,737
For you?
Yeah.

231
00:12:47,706 --> 00:12:49,861
I think it hurts forever.

232
00:12:59,882 --> 00:13:01,784
What the hell is he doing
in my examine room?

233
00:13:01,904 --> 00:13:03,003
Standard pre-op.

234
00:13:03,123 --> 00:13:04,881
If the surgery
is going to be here and...

235
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:06,905
I'm sucking 150 pounds
of fat out of this guy,

236
00:13:07,025 --> 00:13:08,785
then I need state
of the art equipment.

237
00:13:08,905 --> 00:13:10,443
We're not doing
this surgery!

238
00:13:10,563 --> 00:13:12,097
We're not.
I am.

239
00:13:12,217 --> 00:13:13,356
For my son.

240
00:13:13,869 --> 00:13:15,305
I'll sue you,
and I'll win.

241
00:13:15,425 --> 00:13:16,216
Try me.

242
00:13:16,336 --> 00:13:19,120
And I'll get a court order to stop you
from doing the operation...

243
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,888
until the case is settled.

244
00:13:26,662 --> 00:13:29,049
Whoo!
Come on, kimmy, huh?

245
00:13:29,891 --> 00:13:31,390
Let's toast us.

246
00:13:32,701 --> 00:13:34,598
I'm not drinking,
I'm pregnant.

247
00:13:34,718 --> 00:13:38,134
Oh, come on, a little
champagne is not gonna hurt.

248
00:13:38,566 --> 00:13:39,854
Just a little bit.

249
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:43,553
I'm not drinking, Christian,
I'm pregnant.

250
00:13:44,962 --> 00:13:47,727
And what are we
toasting, anyways?

251
00:13:47,847 --> 00:13:52,380
You being a complete asshole and
not caring about anybody but yourself?

252
00:13:58,488 --> 00:14:01,581
I've been thinking long
and hard about the two of us.

253
00:14:04,812 --> 00:14:07,808
Oh, we are not young
anymore, you know?

254
00:14:07,928 --> 00:14:10,924
Like we used to be,
like we were when we first met.

255
00:14:11,044 --> 00:14:12,899
I've had several life lessons

256
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,820
Since then, and
I know you have too, but...

257
00:14:16,367 --> 00:14:18,565
We always keep,
phhtt, you know...

258
00:14:18,685 --> 00:14:20,520
coming back
to each other.

259
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,348
You know,
no matter what.

260
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:26,091
I've never had a connection with
somebody the way that I do with you.

261
00:14:26,211 --> 00:14:28,598
I know that you feel
the same way about me.

262
00:14:30,571 --> 00:14:33,037
We've seen the best
of each other and the worst,

263
00:14:33,157 --> 00:14:35,328
and when we get
between the sheets, it's...

264
00:14:36,804 --> 00:14:37,914
It's magic.

265
00:14:44,297 --> 00:14:47,794
I want you there when
I go to sleep at night,

266
00:14:48,863 --> 00:14:50,861
and I want you there...

267
00:14:51,508 --> 00:14:53,691
when I wake up
in the morning.

268
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,011
Will you marry me?

269
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:08,590
Wow, it's beautiful.

270
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:11,213
It's vintage, baby.
Just like us.

271
00:15:17,905 --> 00:15:20,507
One small, caveat,
sweetie pie.

272
00:15:20,872 --> 00:15:21,773
Yeah?

273
00:15:23,033 --> 00:15:24,491
No babies.

274
00:15:30,983 --> 00:15:32,375
Dr. Mcnamara?

275
00:15:33,931 --> 00:15:36,732
The, uh, the victim's
father's here.

276
00:15:42,463 --> 00:15:45,645
When they told me you refused
to operate on Clovis,

277
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:48,098
I was pretty damn mad.

278
00:15:49,275 --> 00:15:52,399
I know I had to meet you face
to face so you could at least...

279
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:54,072
hear my side of the story.

280
00:15:54,192 --> 00:15:56,948
With all due respect,
Mr. Martel, I don't need to.

281
00:15:57,446 --> 00:16:00,305
I already know the details
of your daughter's death, and...

282
00:16:00,425 --> 00:16:03,007
it does not change
my position as a doctor.

283
00:16:03,127 --> 00:16:06,909
It's been 15 years since...
Clovis was given the death penalty.

284
00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:08,562
15 years.

285
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:12,004
My daughter was only
17 when he killed her.

286
00:16:12,601 --> 00:16:13,621
You know they...

287
00:16:13,741 --> 00:16:16,700
They say when a family
member gets cancer, it's like...

288
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,742
the whole family
gets cancer.

289
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,667
Imagine what it's like...

290
00:16:21,787 --> 00:16:24,654
when your baby girl
is brutally murdered.

291
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,413
Would it be all right
if I used your phone?

292
00:16:30,533 --> 00:16:32,399
I'm sorry, Wesley,
but it's a little late.

293
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:34,261
I just want to order a pizza.

294
00:16:34,381 --> 00:16:36,067
Please?
I'm really hungry.

295
00:16:36,187 --> 00:16:37,303
Look, please?

296
00:16:38,054 --> 00:16:40,719
I reported you to police
for looking in my window.

297
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:42,530
Please just leave me alone.

298
00:16:45,235 --> 00:16:47,323
He treated her
like an animal.

299
00:16:49,378 --> 00:16:51,836
Look, Mr. Martel, I...

300
00:16:52,737 --> 00:16:54,981
I can imagine what
you've been through.

301
00:16:55,101 --> 00:16:56,534
No, you can't.

302
00:16:58,805 --> 00:17:00,869
My wife died of heart disease.

303
00:17:02,842 --> 00:17:04,367
The stress of waiting,

304
00:17:04,748 --> 00:17:06,420
of not knowing if or...

305
00:17:07,066 --> 00:17:09,834
when we could put
an end to this.

306
00:17:12,095 --> 00:17:13,665
Now it's my turn.

307
00:17:13,785 --> 00:17:16,388
Chordoma.
Base of the spine.

308
00:17:16,508 --> 00:17:19,355
I know a surgeon
at St. Joseph's, uh,

309
00:17:19,475 --> 00:17:22,170
a specialist in bone cancer
who's had a lot of success...

310
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,109
with gamma ray and
laser technology...

311
00:17:24,229 --> 00:17:26,027
No thanks, doc.
I... I'm...

312
00:17:26,367 --> 00:17:27,939
I'm happy to leave.

313
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:32,541
I just... don't want to go
before he does.

314
00:17:33,739 --> 00:17:35,819
So I can face my daughter...

315
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:38,266
and tell her that we...

316
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:41,427
we punished the man
who took your life.

317
00:17:42,819 --> 00:17:44,259
You were given...

318
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,751
justice.

319
00:17:48,764 --> 00:17:51,134
Justice, baby girl.

320
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:05,017
- Hi.
- Hey. Am I too early?

321
00:18:05,137 --> 00:18:07,472
No, no, I'm running late.
Come in.

322
00:18:07,592 --> 00:18:09,028
Heh. Good.

323
00:18:09,741 --> 00:18:12,295
- How are you?
- Good. Nice to see you.

324
00:18:15,114 --> 00:18:17,662
You know, I was so
surprised to get a call.

325
00:18:17,782 --> 00:18:19,387
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

326
00:18:19,507 --> 00:18:20,696
Just surprised?

327
00:18:20,816 --> 00:18:22,096
Well, and happy.

328
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,608
Excited.

329
00:18:23,873 --> 00:18:25,636
Ok, I'm gonna be
right back, all right?

330
00:18:25,756 --> 00:18:26,923
All right.

331
00:18:31,293 --> 00:18:34,083
Ah. You did some
redecorating, huh?

332
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,758
Yeah, I got rid of some stuff.

333
00:18:36,878 --> 00:18:39,725
Uh, I read this article
somewhere that said...

334
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:43,144
you shouldn't have anything
in your home if it's not...

335
00:18:43,264 --> 00:18:45,725
beautiful or useful.
So I'm just...

336
00:18:46,537 --> 00:18:48,261
trying to live like that.

337
00:18:48,529 --> 00:18:49,589
I like it.

338
00:18:49,709 --> 00:18:51,140
Makes sense.

339
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,333
Hey, you know, I was thinking
we should check out this uh...

340
00:19:02,453 --> 00:19:03,788
new mediterranean restaurant.

341
00:19:03,908 --> 00:19:06,858
A patient of mine said that
it's supposed to be unreal.

342
00:19:07,654 --> 00:19:08,590
Well...

343
00:19:08,938 --> 00:19:11,672
I hope you can cancel
those reservations.

344
00:19:49,074 --> 00:19:49,886
What?

345
00:19:50,483 --> 00:19:51,970
How far along are you?

346
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:52,853
What?

347
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:55,889
Your breasts are swollen,
your nipples are darker...

348
00:19:56,009 --> 00:19:58,979
and you have mild acne
from the progesterone increase.

349
00:19:59,642 --> 00:20:00,851
I guess...

350
00:20:01,686 --> 00:20:03,148
7 weeks?

351
00:20:04,856 --> 00:20:05,966
Six.

352
00:20:07,557 --> 00:20:08,590
Well...

353
00:20:09,717 --> 00:20:11,806
We know it's not mine, then.

354
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,412
And yet...

355
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:21,013
You called me over here to have sex
with you so you could, what...

356
00:20:22,082 --> 00:20:24,493
Make me think
I was the daddy?

357
00:20:25,563 --> 00:20:26,399
Why?

358
00:20:31,819 --> 00:20:35,217
Because I can barely manage one.

359
00:20:36,371 --> 00:20:39,421
A single mother with 2 kids?

360
00:20:39,835 --> 00:20:42,305
I'm not gonna find a man again.

361
00:20:42,934 --> 00:20:46,248
And I can't do this
on my own, Mike.

362
00:20:48,459 --> 00:20:51,492
And you and I, we were
really good together.

363
00:20:54,343 --> 00:20:55,652
We were.

364
00:20:58,502 --> 00:21:02,430
I am so, so sorry.

365
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,145
Yeah.

366
00:21:04,767 --> 00:21:05,909
Me, too.

367
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:08,926
And I thought...

368
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,876
you'd be a really good dad.

369
00:21:16,102 --> 00:21:18,752
Do you think you could possibly...

370
00:21:19,313 --> 00:21:21,301
forgive me for this?

371
00:21:21,901 --> 00:21:23,409
I have a better idea.

372
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,088
Marry me.

373
00:21:37,117 --> 00:21:39,587
Did you see that swarm
of news helicopters?

374
00:21:39,707 --> 00:21:40,523
Whoa!

375
00:21:42,595 --> 00:21:44,303
Glad you changed your mind.

376
00:21:48,008 --> 00:21:50,357
The guns are gonna have
to remain outside the O.R.

377
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:52,258
They've all been soaked in...

378
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:56,398
the hydrogen peroxide gas-plasma
sterilizer for 14 hours, Dr. Mcnamara.

379
00:21:56,518 --> 00:21:58,328
They're completely germ-free.

380
00:21:58,448 --> 00:21:59,340
Who are you?

381
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,109
Dr. Neal. I'm here to look over
Dr. Cruz's shoulder,

382
00:22:02,229 --> 00:22:03,858
double check her numbers.

383
00:22:03,978 --> 00:22:07,386
Yeah, god forbid I make a mistake
and Mr. Clovis never wakes up.

384
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:10,625
My... my lawyer said
this is costing $300,000.

385
00:22:10,745 --> 00:22:12,316
That's a lot of money.

386
00:22:12,436 --> 00:22:15,123
Everyone loses because of
what you did, Wesley.

387
00:22:15,504 --> 00:22:18,752
Why don't you just kill me then,
and just get it over with?

388
00:22:18,872 --> 00:22:20,761
That's not my job, Mr. Clovis.

389
00:22:22,369 --> 00:22:25,220
Count back...
from a hundred for me.

390
00:22:26,864 --> 00:22:29,123
99, 98...

391
00:23:05,358 --> 00:23:07,894
Jesus, that lunch was disgusting.

392
00:23:08,014 --> 00:23:10,271
How come you ain't fighting
to sit on the crown?

393
00:23:10,391 --> 00:23:11,590
'cause I didn't eat it.

394
00:23:11,658 --> 00:23:14,594
Mcnamara, grab your shit,
you're getting transferred.

395
00:23:26,942 --> 00:23:30,688
I don't like releasing inmates
before they're rehabilitated.

396
00:23:30,808 --> 00:23:32,210
I'm getting out of here?

397
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:34,414
I know I'll see you
in here again.

398
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:43,178
No, no, no,...
there's no need for that.

399
00:23:58,863 --> 00:24:01,561
And who's going to be
driving you home today?

400
00:24:01,681 --> 00:24:02,327
Me.

401
00:24:02,447 --> 00:24:04,958
We can't let you risk driving
after the procedure.

402
00:24:05,078 --> 00:24:08,317
Ok, well, I don't really have
anyone that I can call, so...

403
00:24:08,437 --> 00:24:12,715
I'm sure you know someone
who could take off an hour and a half.

404
00:24:24,374 --> 00:24:26,485
Hey. It's kimber.

405
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:34,177
Come on, come on,
I got you. Come on! Come on!

406
00:24:42,134 --> 00:24:43,231
Thanks.

407
00:24:44,192 --> 00:24:45,402
I had it, though.

408
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:49,020
No sense killing yourself when
you're almost a free man, Matt.

409
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,529
Do I know you?

410
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,283
Jeremiah.

411
00:24:56,697 --> 00:25:00,107
What, uh, makes you
so special, Matt?

412
00:25:01,137 --> 00:25:05,348
You're the one they gonna let go
after they execute that boy, right?

413
00:25:06,209 --> 00:25:07,571
So tell me,

414
00:25:07,691 --> 00:25:10,702
what do you do to deserve
a second chance like that?

415
00:25:11,779 --> 00:25:13,908
My dads did
the surgery on Wesley.

416
00:25:14,028 --> 00:25:16,307
I'm not talkin' about that.

417
00:25:18,031 --> 00:25:20,020
I'm asking you...

418
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:25,479
How come you can
get away with murder?

419
00:25:29,573 --> 00:25:30,378
What?

420
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:32,761
Wesley's not the one
who killed that girl.

421
00:25:32,881 --> 00:25:34,663
Well, they did 2 trials,
Jeremiah.

422
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,131
You talked to him?

423
00:25:36,251 --> 00:25:38,186
That boy's so simple,
he couldn't figure out...

424
00:25:38,306 --> 00:25:39,921
how to murder a hot dog.

425
00:25:39,989 --> 00:25:43,351
He just in the wrong place
at the wrong time, that's all.

426
00:25:43,471 --> 00:25:45,432
How do you know this?
Were you there?

427
00:25:45,552 --> 00:25:46,224
No.

428
00:25:46,606 --> 00:25:50,136
I spent 11 years in a cell
with the man who was.

429
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:55,582
So you're saying somebody
confessed to you.

430
00:25:55,702 --> 00:25:57,331
Bragged was more like it.

431
00:26:01,862 --> 00:26:04,675
He told me all
the gory details, too.

432
00:26:04,795 --> 00:26:06,552
He was a sick bastard.

433
00:26:08,675 --> 00:26:10,147
That doesn't make any sense.

434
00:26:10,215 --> 00:26:12,201
You spent your life
behind bars like I have,

435
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:13,527
nothin' makes sense.

436
00:26:13,647 --> 00:26:15,913
You know how many innocent men
there are on death row...

437
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:18,113
just 'cause they couldn't
afford to write a lawyer?

438
00:26:18,233 --> 00:26:18,979
Please.

439
00:26:19,047 --> 00:26:20,912
Let me ask you something...
Why are you telling me this?

440
00:26:21,032 --> 00:26:22,884
Why haven't you said
anything to the warden?

441
00:26:23,004 --> 00:26:25,816
What would that get me?
They'd just tell me I'm crazy.

442
00:26:25,936 --> 00:26:28,033
You the one
that need to be told.

443
00:26:28,614 --> 00:26:31,188
You see, freedom is
a heavy burden,

444
00:26:32,514 --> 00:26:34,126
And seeing as how...

445
00:26:34,246 --> 00:26:37,281
god saw fit to give it to you,

446
00:26:37,401 --> 00:26:39,213
it's only fair that...

447
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:41,417
you have to pay the price.

448
00:26:42,404 --> 00:26:43,415
Tomorrow,

449
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:46,316
Wesley's blood
will be on your hands.

450
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:00,916
Hi.

451
00:27:01,792 --> 00:27:03,901
- Thanks for coming.
- No problem.

452
00:27:04,021 --> 00:27:06,223
Sorry they're so ridiculous
with the rules.

453
00:27:06,343 --> 00:27:07,802
Oh, it's no problem.

454
00:27:11,028 --> 00:27:13,697
I know it's weird
I called you.

455
00:27:15,805 --> 00:27:18,043
But at the end of the day,
I just feel...

456
00:27:18,163 --> 00:27:20,467
more comfortable with you.
I mean, you've been...

457
00:27:20,587 --> 00:27:22,078
through this with him.

458
00:27:23,831 --> 00:27:26,417
Can I ask you
a personal question?

459
00:27:27,224 --> 00:27:28,683
Do you regret...

460
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:30,241
your abortion?

461
00:27:31,418 --> 00:27:32,532
Sometimes.

462
00:27:33,427 --> 00:27:34,323
I mean,

463
00:27:34,443 --> 00:27:37,174
sometimes I think it would
have been nice to have a son,

464
00:27:37,294 --> 00:27:38,947
no matter how imperfect.

465
00:27:39,461 --> 00:27:42,279
Be nice to have someone
to love and care for.

466
00:27:43,223 --> 00:27:45,778
Maybe then I wouldn't have
married Christian.

467
00:27:45,898 --> 00:27:48,283
You know,
that's a chapter I could have...

468
00:27:48,403 --> 00:27:50,090
easily done without.

469
00:27:52,858 --> 00:27:57,963
You must think I am completely
insane for doing this for him.

470
00:27:59,287 --> 00:28:00,331
You know,

471
00:28:00,928 --> 00:28:03,472
I didn't come here to advise you.
I just...

472
00:28:03,592 --> 00:28:05,643
I came to drive you home.

473
00:28:05,763 --> 00:28:07,387
Yeah, I understand.

474
00:28:11,237 --> 00:28:12,298
Listen...

475
00:28:12,896 --> 00:28:15,115
At the time, I just...

476
00:28:15,447 --> 00:28:18,482
I didn't think I could raise
a child by myself.

477
00:28:18,889 --> 00:28:21,041
And I knew that
if I had a...

478
00:28:21,161 --> 00:28:23,955
down syndrome baby with
Christian, it would be...

479
00:28:24,075 --> 00:28:25,342
by myself.

480
00:28:25,718 --> 00:28:26,497
Yeah.

481
00:28:28,718 --> 00:28:30,740
But the thing is is that I...

482
00:28:31,386 --> 00:28:34,797
I wanted to have
this baby so bad,

483
00:28:34,917 --> 00:28:36,187
and I begged him.

484
00:28:36,255 --> 00:28:38,502
I mean, I begged him.

485
00:28:39,364 --> 00:28:43,918
And I even thought, maybe like you,
you know, I could just do it on my own.

486
00:28:44,038 --> 00:28:47,573
And then, I even entertained
the idea of...

487
00:28:47,693 --> 00:28:48,745
Marry you?

488
00:28:49,325 --> 00:28:50,079
Yeah.

489
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:53,311
We're both not getting
any younger.

490
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:55,880
Everybody has got baggage.

491
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,951
Divorce, kids.

492
00:28:59,182 --> 00:29:00,768
The important thing...

493
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,848
is that you find
the right person...

494
00:29:03,968 --> 00:29:06,871
that you want to spend
the rest of your life with.

495
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:13,146
But in the end, it's Christian
that I just can't live without.

496
00:29:13,766 --> 00:29:16,526
And I just want to be with him, Liz.
I want to marry him.

497
00:29:16,646 --> 00:29:19,095
I just want to spend
the rest of my life with him,

498
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:20,416
I always have.

499
00:29:20,989 --> 00:29:25,120
And that's what I want more than
anything, even more than this baby.

500
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,907
And I know it sounds awful...

501
00:29:27,027 --> 00:29:29,465
No, it doesn't.
And I know,

502
00:29:29,585 --> 00:29:32,313
You have got bad case
of Christian.

503
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:34,773
You got it worse
than any of us.

504
00:29:34,893 --> 00:29:36,062
I know.
God.

505
00:29:37,554 --> 00:29:41,420
The thing is, I know that I have
screwed up so bad with Jenna.

506
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,741
I mean, it's painful for me.

507
00:29:44,263 --> 00:29:47,869
So I guess I just wanted
Christian to see that I could be...

508
00:29:47,989 --> 00:29:49,148
Kimber Henry?

509
00:29:49,268 --> 00:29:49,901
Hi.

510
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:51,343
Ok.

511
00:29:53,016 --> 00:29:54,594
I've got to do this.

512
00:29:57,735 --> 00:29:59,555
You know it's going to be ok.

513
00:29:59,938 --> 00:30:00,767
Right?

514
00:30:00,887 --> 00:30:02,291
I mean, who knows?

515
00:30:02,411 --> 00:30:05,344
In a year, Christian
might want another baby.

516
00:30:06,316 --> 00:30:07,112
Right?

517
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:09,034
Maybe. Yeah.

518
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,336
Well,

519
00:30:13,198 --> 00:30:16,210
You are really
a strong woman, Liz.

520
00:30:16,908 --> 00:30:19,560
I can see why
Christian married you.

521
00:30:22,356 --> 00:30:24,813
- All right.
- All right.

522
00:30:26,802 --> 00:30:27,964
I'll be back.

523
00:30:28,031 --> 00:30:29,426
I'll be right here.

524
00:30:29,546 --> 00:30:30,669
- Ok.
- Ok.

525
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:32,904
- Hi.
- This way.

526
00:30:45,848 --> 00:30:48,700
Here, this will keep you
nice and warm.

527
00:30:51,771 --> 00:30:53,434
Your fever's going down.

528
00:30:53,554 --> 00:30:54,821
That's good, huh?

529
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,157
Why don't you get
some sleep?

530
00:30:58,277 --> 00:30:58,908
Ok.

531
00:31:03,162 --> 00:31:06,511
Oh, sweetness, listen, listen.
You're gonna be fine.

532
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:10,464
And when you feel better,
it's not gonna seem so bleak, ok?

533
00:31:11,143 --> 00:31:12,900
Girl scout promise.

534
00:31:14,807 --> 00:31:16,107
Get some rest.

535
00:31:22,669 --> 00:31:24,012
Welcome home.

536
00:31:24,426 --> 00:31:25,325
Lizzie.

537
00:31:27,082 --> 00:31:28,704
To what do I owe the pleasure?

538
00:31:28,824 --> 00:31:30,397
I was helping kimber.

539
00:31:30,868 --> 00:31:32,312
She's not feeling so well,

540
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:34,721
but I think she's
finally gone to sleep.

541
00:31:35,439 --> 00:31:37,266
Would you just stop
speaking in code?

542
00:31:37,334 --> 00:31:39,092
Just tell me
what's going on.

543
00:31:39,212 --> 00:31:41,298
I drove her home
from the hospital.

544
00:31:42,027 --> 00:31:43,547
After she had...

545
00:31:45,088 --> 00:31:46,431
the procedure.

546
00:31:47,011 --> 00:31:48,307
So she got rid of it?

547
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:49,140
Yeah.

548
00:31:49,488 --> 00:31:51,327
She got rid of "it".

549
00:31:52,826 --> 00:31:53,622
Wow.

550
00:31:55,532 --> 00:31:56,411
Wow.

551
00:31:58,898 --> 00:32:01,782
Well, I guess that means
I'm getting married.

552
00:32:04,086 --> 00:32:07,448
Well, you know, I guess I should,
ahem, go congratulate the misses.

553
00:32:07,568 --> 00:32:09,102
Oh, no, please. Don't.

554
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:11,100
There were complications.

555
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,820
What kind of complications?

556
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,162
A perforation.

557
00:32:14,282 --> 00:32:16,835
- Her cervix was retroverted.
- Lizzie...

558
00:32:17,365 --> 00:32:20,009
Stop it with this.
Just please, say it.

559
00:32:20,129 --> 00:32:22,185
She can't have
any more children.

560
00:32:23,743 --> 00:32:25,645
Not that that matters to you,

561
00:32:25,713 --> 00:32:27,766
Because you don't
want any more,

562
00:32:27,886 --> 00:32:28,830
Right?

563
00:32:30,206 --> 00:32:32,313
Now I know she's
no mother Teresa,

564
00:32:32,433 --> 00:32:36,009
but she cannot have
any more babies.

565
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,932
So if at some point in the future,
you decide to leave her,

566
00:32:42,744 --> 00:32:45,690
put that little piece of information
into the equation...

567
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:50,143
as a reminder of just what
she gave up to be with you.

568
00:32:57,027 --> 00:32:59,990
Why did she come to you
instead of coming to me?

569
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:00,878
Why?

570
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:03,529
Because she was scared,

571
00:33:03,597 --> 00:33:05,444
and I had done it before.

572
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:10,470
And because I was not
the one who told her to do it.

573
00:33:31,595 --> 00:33:33,410
Did you come to tell me
the deal's off?

574
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:34,276
What?

575
00:33:34,396 --> 00:33:36,596
No!
We come to bring you this.

576
00:33:36,716 --> 00:33:38,924
Can't have you heading out
on your first day of freedom...

577
00:33:39,044 --> 00:33:40,730
in the same rags
you came in here in.

578
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:43,500
We checked with the warden.
You can take that back to your cell...

579
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,086
and change while
you wait for your release.

580
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,896
- Thanks.
- You're welcome!

581
00:33:54,889 --> 00:33:57,060
So this means
Wesley's going to be...

582
00:33:57,872 --> 00:33:59,066
In an hour.

583
00:34:01,725 --> 00:34:04,692
They figured out a way
to do it without pain, then?

584
00:34:05,182 --> 00:34:06,628
That's why we're here.

585
00:34:06,748 --> 00:34:09,341
To make sure the doses are correct,
to answer any questions...

586
00:34:09,461 --> 00:34:11,317
before they put him to sleep.

587
00:34:13,729 --> 00:34:15,664
What made you
change your mind?

588
00:34:15,784 --> 00:34:17,425
I didn't change my mind.

589
00:34:17,545 --> 00:34:20,312
I always thought Wesley
should pay for what he did.

590
00:34:20,621 --> 00:34:22,904
Just like anyone
who commits a crime should.

591
00:34:23,024 --> 00:34:24,511
All right, sean, come on.

592
00:34:24,579 --> 00:34:26,627
He's paid plenty
for his mistakes.

593
00:34:27,708 --> 00:34:28,792
Haven't you?

594
00:34:28,912 --> 00:34:31,373
I mean, it's not like you
murdered or raped anybody,

595
00:34:31,493 --> 00:34:32,832
like that asshole.

596
00:34:33,213 --> 00:34:36,053
I know you're going to be
a good boy, aren't you?

597
00:34:36,955 --> 00:34:39,045
- Yeah, that's right.
- You promise?

598
00:34:39,165 --> 00:34:40,126
You see?

599
00:34:40,246 --> 00:34:42,104
He's gonna be
a changed man.

600
00:34:50,507 --> 00:34:51,389
Wait.

601
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,624
There's something
I need to tell you guys first...

602
00:34:57,506 --> 00:34:59,943
about Wesley and the execution.

603
00:35:00,457 --> 00:35:01,141
What?

604
00:35:10,744 --> 00:35:12,484
He's told people...

605
00:35:14,556 --> 00:35:15,484
What?

606
00:35:16,344 --> 00:35:19,294
That if he ever gets out of here,
he'll do it again.

607
00:35:20,007 --> 00:35:21,625
He's a very sick man,

608
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:24,790
And you should have no remorse
for what you're doing.

609
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,547
And I'm sorry for
what I said to you.

610
00:35:32,012 --> 00:35:34,584
I know you were just trying
to do the right thing.

611
00:35:34,704 --> 00:35:36,660
You're my dad
and I love you.

612
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:55,109
I don't want to see this.

613
00:35:55,229 --> 00:35:57,682
You don't have a choice.
It's part of the deal.

614
00:35:57,802 --> 00:36:00,487
We're the only ones who know
how much fat we sucked out of him.

615
00:36:00,607 --> 00:36:03,406
They want to stop murderers,
they should televise this shit.

616
00:36:03,526 --> 00:36:06,953
If they want to abolish the death penalty,
they should televise it.

617
00:36:07,073 --> 00:36:08,481
We shouldn't have done this.

618
00:36:08,548 --> 00:36:09,944
No regrets, all right?

619
00:36:10,064 --> 00:36:12,242
I mean, come on.
This guy was going to die anyway.

620
00:36:12,362 --> 00:36:16,017
And now your son loves you
again, right? It's a good thing.

621
00:36:16,137 --> 00:36:21,269
Besides, we've seen people die before.
Hell, we threw them in the swamp.

622
00:36:22,267 --> 00:36:24,405
This is painless and justified.

623
00:36:25,001 --> 00:36:27,268
You trying to convince me
or yourself?

624
00:36:27,388 --> 00:36:30,206
The prisoner wants
to see you two.

625
00:36:48,057 --> 00:36:50,125
Is it supposed to hurt this bad?

626
00:36:50,245 --> 00:36:52,452
We haven't administered
the drugs yet, Wesley.

627
00:36:52,572 --> 00:36:55,621
No, I mean the surgery.

628
00:36:57,661 --> 00:37:00,417
I was up puking
all night this night.

629
00:37:01,904 --> 00:37:04,535
I couldn't eat my last meal.

630
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:06,548
Didn't they give you
the pain meds?

631
00:37:06,668 --> 00:37:08,001
I asked about them,...

632
00:37:08,121 --> 00:37:11,552
but they said it would interfere
with... with the stuff.

633
00:37:13,458 --> 00:37:16,268
One of you want
to double check my numbers?

634
00:37:20,178 --> 00:37:23,075
I've never seen this much
sodium thiental prescribed.

635
00:37:23,195 --> 00:37:24,981
That's kind of the point.

636
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:27,914
Can't we just give him
some versed to calm him down?

637
00:37:28,034 --> 00:37:29,622
The barbiturates
won't be affected...

638
00:37:29,742 --> 00:37:31,509
This isn't Beverly Hills.

639
00:37:34,426 --> 00:37:36,400
The incision's infected.
You didn't see that?

640
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,410
Guys, as long as the numbers
in the file are correct,

641
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:41,308
it's all gonna be fine.

642
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:45,758
Yeah, they're fine.

643
00:37:48,526 --> 00:37:49,639
Time to go.

644
00:37:53,906 --> 00:37:57,123
Tell me it's not going to hurt.
Tell me it's not going...

645
00:37:57,243 --> 00:37:59,748
It's not going to hurt.
Wesley, look at me.

646
00:38:00,461 --> 00:38:02,345
It's not going to hurt,
I promise, ok?

647
00:38:02,465 --> 00:38:04,334
You're just gonna
go to sleep.

648
00:38:32,138 --> 00:38:33,331
Mr. Clovis,

649
00:38:33,451 --> 00:38:37,557
the governor of California has denied
your final request for clemency.

650
00:38:38,163 --> 00:38:40,412
Do you have any final words?

651
00:40:01,428 --> 00:40:03,893
Calling it at 3:17 P.M.

652
00:40:12,851 --> 00:40:14,625
Can we get our son
back now?

653
00:40:16,356 --> 00:40:18,990
Yeah.
I'll go finish his paperwork.

654
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:30,001
It's all over now,
Mr. Martel.

655
00:40:31,377 --> 00:40:32,552
I guess so.

656
00:40:33,862 --> 00:40:36,004
It doesn't feel like it,
though.

657
00:42:08,008 --> 00:42:11,008
