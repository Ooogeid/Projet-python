1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,310
Previously on nip/tuck...

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:04,271
Kimber's missing.

3
00:00:04,757 --> 00:00:07,267
Coast guard thinks
she's dead.

4
00:00:08,238 --> 00:00:10,949
I don't know what to do.

5
00:00:12,088 --> 00:00:16,230
If you do the surgery
I'll pay you $300,000

6
00:00:16,887 --> 00:00:18,335
Senor Perez.

7
00:00:18,455 --> 00:00:19,874
Let's schedule.

8
00:00:20,382 --> 00:00:21,864
I'm Escobar Gallardo,

9
00:00:21,984 --> 00:00:24,996
the former boss
of Silvio Perez.

10
00:00:26,217 --> 00:00:29,480
Silvio stole
my daughter's innocence.

11
00:00:29,823 --> 00:00:32,066
Your brother said he was
with the boss' girl.

12
00:00:32,186 --> 00:00:34,084
- How old was she?
- She was 6.

13
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,602
Tell me what you don't...

14
00:00:43,485 --> 00:00:44,822
Honey,
how old are you?

15
00:00:44,942 --> 00:00:45,878
15.

16
00:00:46,247 --> 00:00:47,958
All right.
That's what I thought.

17
00:00:48,078 --> 00:00:50,067
I'm sorry, but any surgical
procedure would require

18
00:00:50,187 --> 00:00:51,751
a parent present on a minor.

19
00:00:51,871 --> 00:00:53,583
Will your mother be
joining us today?

20
00:00:53,703 --> 00:00:55,879
Not unless you can
bring back the dead.

21
00:00:57,037 --> 00:00:57,857
Sorry.

22
00:00:58,162 --> 00:01:00,924
You're exactly as
my father described you.

23
00:01:04,138 --> 00:01:06,495
- And your father is?
- In hell.

24
00:01:06,615 --> 00:01:07,533
With her.

25
00:01:07,653 --> 00:01:11,690
If there's any truth to what the nuns
taught me in catholic school.

26
00:01:12,678 --> 00:01:14,636
They say I look like him.

27
00:01:16,561 --> 00:01:18,420
I'm Aurelia Gallardo.

28
00:01:19,943 --> 00:01:22,304
Escobar Gallardo's daughter.

29
00:01:24,162 --> 00:01:25,837
The devil's child.

30
00:01:27,642 --> 00:01:31,224
Monsters never consider
the shame they leave their children.

31
00:01:31,344 --> 00:01:33,516
It becomes part
of their identity.

32
00:01:34,906 --> 00:01:37,701
Are you sure you're only... 15?

33
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,319
15.

34
00:01:40,455 --> 00:01:42,512
Old enough to understand
all the suffering

35
00:01:42,632 --> 00:01:45,590
my family has inflicted on
so many innocent people.

36
00:01:47,511 --> 00:01:50,760
Aurelia, I really don't know
how we can help you.

37
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,803
You can help me
figure out who I am.

38
00:01:52,923 --> 00:01:55,548
- I don't think that that...
- Silvio Perez.

39
00:01:56,857 --> 00:01:59,521
He was one of my father's
business associates.

40
00:02:00,073 --> 00:02:03,162
I also seem to recall he was
a patient of yours at one time.

41
00:02:03,282 --> 00:02:04,333
Am I correct?

42
00:02:04,453 --> 00:02:06,146
- Well, he, uh...
- I'm sorry.

43
00:02:06,266 --> 00:02:08,325
That name doesn't
ring any bells.

44
00:02:09,904 --> 00:02:12,256
Well, it was
a long time ago.

45
00:02:13,152 --> 00:02:15,627
I was 8 when uncle
Silvio disappeared.

46
00:02:15,747 --> 00:02:18,216
I started therapy
a few years ago.

47
00:02:18,336 --> 00:02:20,803
Thought it might help
with the nightmares.

48
00:02:21,254 --> 00:02:24,545
Of course, it's not surprising
I had nightmares

49
00:02:24,665 --> 00:02:26,935
considering my life
was one.

50
00:02:27,721 --> 00:02:30,681
I remember something
about a surgery Silvio had

51
00:02:30,801 --> 00:02:32,706
when you practiced
in Florida.

52
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:33,915
Sorry.

53
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,476
Unfortunately,

54
00:02:37,095 --> 00:02:40,168
I remember your father,
but Silvio Perez?

55
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:41,624
Sean?

56
00:02:42,075 --> 00:02:44,827
Uh, no.
It doesn't sound familiar.

57
00:02:47,656 --> 00:02:48,660
Funny.

58
00:02:49,438 --> 00:02:51,479
There's so much violence
I can't forget,

59
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,454
no matter
how hard I try.

60
00:02:53,853 --> 00:02:55,865
Yet the truth of who I am,

61
00:02:55,985 --> 00:02:58,108
why I feel the way I feel,

62
00:02:58,493 --> 00:03:00,468
that's still a mystery.

63
00:03:02,284 --> 00:03:04,753
I wish I could help you,
but I can't.

64
00:03:06,176 --> 00:03:07,414
I understand.

65
00:03:09,021 --> 00:03:11,205
Maybe it's right
that I never know.

66
00:03:13,281 --> 00:03:17,395
I suppose it's only just that
I suffer for the sins of my father.

72
00:04:12,406 --> 00:04:13,535
Are you insane?

73
00:04:13,536 --> 00:04:15,183
I thought you'd be
more sympathetic.

74
00:04:15,303 --> 00:04:17,443
You know what it's like
to be abused at a young age,

75
00:04:17,563 --> 00:04:18,933
to want answers
and closure.

76
00:04:19,053 --> 00:04:20,877
You're gonna get us
closure in a jail cell.

77
00:04:20,997 --> 00:04:22,280
Oh, stop being so dramatic.

78
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,826
Stop using my past to manipulate
me into agreeing with you.

79
00:04:24,946 --> 00:04:27,362
What are you two guys
arguing about today?

80
00:04:27,482 --> 00:04:28,635
You tell her.

81
00:04:30,923 --> 00:04:34,635
Our morning consult turned out
to be Escobar's daughter.

82
00:04:34,755 --> 00:04:36,917
But don't worry,
she's just a kid.

83
00:04:37,037 --> 00:04:39,747
He's dead, Gala's dead,
and she's all alone.

84
00:04:40,099 --> 00:04:42,763
In Roman times, your enemies
would kill your children

85
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:45,679
after they killed you to make sure
there was no one left

86
00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:47,487
to grow up to take revenge.

87
00:04:47,607 --> 00:04:50,664
Anyone who shares the blood
of that animal is not to be trusted.

88
00:04:50,784 --> 00:04:52,152
She doesn't want revenge.

89
00:04:52,272 --> 00:04:54,545
She wants to know what happened
to the man who molested her.

90
00:04:54,665 --> 00:04:56,483
Oh, and you're
considering telling her?

91
00:04:56,603 --> 00:04:58,522
Look,
I know in theory

92
00:04:58,642 --> 00:05:00,839
telling her what happened
could somehow

93
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:02,884
implicate us in a crime,
but...

94
00:05:03,004 --> 00:05:04,605
A number of crimes.

95
00:05:04,725 --> 00:05:07,539
Cessory to murder,
obstruction of justice.

96
00:05:07,659 --> 00:05:10,192
I mean, hell, they could
nail us on an EPA violation

97
00:05:10,312 --> 00:05:11,932
for feeding alligators.

98
00:05:12,052 --> 00:05:14,223
But there's isn't any
evidence of any of that.

99
00:05:14,343 --> 00:05:16,700
- And no one's ever gonna find it.
- Screw the evidence.

100
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,561
All right, it's done.
We got away with it.

101
00:05:18,681 --> 00:05:19,550
It's like winning the lottery.

102
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:20,936
You don't screw
with that kind of luck.

103
00:05:21,056 --> 00:05:22,940
Ok, no. We're not even
gonna discuss it.

104
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:26,220
I'm not gonna let you bring
even a little piece of that man

105
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,223
back into our lives to relive
some kind of Irish catholic guilt

106
00:05:29,343 --> 00:05:30,933
that all of a sudden
you're feeling.

107
00:05:31,053 --> 00:05:34,099
- Liz.
- No! No. No.

108
00:05:35,513 --> 00:05:36,468
No.

109
00:05:38,239 --> 00:05:40,716
2 against 1, buddy boy.
You lose.

110
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:46,669
Tell me what you don't like
about yourself, Ms. Hayes.

111
00:05:46,789 --> 00:05:48,658
This town, Dr. Troy,

112
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:51,573
is an impossible place
for a girl to be herself.

113
00:05:51,693 --> 00:05:53,646
Don't tell me
you're an actress.

114
00:05:54,157 --> 00:05:56,884
Like everybody else
you meet on the street, right?

115
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:59,837
Chicks like me are a dime
a dozen in Hollywood.

116
00:05:59,957 --> 00:06:02,050
Back in Michigan,
where I'm from, I was hot shit.

117
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,757
I'd go to the clubs and
the bouncers would say,

118
00:06:04,877 --> 00:06:06,639
"Right this way, ten."

119
00:06:07,557 --> 00:06:09,180
Right this way, ten.

120
00:06:12,343 --> 00:06:14,000
Right this way, ten.

121
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:17,780
Really?
Is that what they'd say?

122
00:06:20,308 --> 00:06:22,634
I'm not a ten, am I?

123
00:06:24,215 --> 00:06:27,881
Out here I barely register
as a six, maybe a seven.

124
00:06:29,395 --> 00:06:31,693
Out here,
that makes me a nobody.

125
00:06:31,813 --> 00:06:33,185
You shouldn't be
so rough on yourself.

126
00:06:33,305 --> 00:06:35,026
You're a very
pretty girl.

127
00:06:36,198 --> 00:06:37,754
You really think so?

128
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:39,662
Yes, I do.

129
00:06:43,394 --> 00:06:45,035
Would you bang me?

130
00:06:47,043 --> 00:06:49,775
On that desk.
Right now.

131
00:06:50,746 --> 00:06:53,498
Unfortunately, that's not
much of a barometer.

132
00:06:53,799 --> 00:06:55,423
I'm a horny devil.

133
00:06:55,741 --> 00:06:57,364
Then let's do it.

134
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:05,531
Just hold on a second.

135
00:07:07,536 --> 00:07:10,512
Playing hide the tree trunk
with me might, uh,

136
00:07:10,632 --> 00:07:13,263
boost your ego
for a little while,

137
00:07:13,383 --> 00:07:16,545
but then eventually you have
to go back to your real life as a six.

138
00:07:16,665 --> 00:07:18,822
- Maybe a seven.
- Maybe a seven.

139
00:07:21,767 --> 00:07:24,059
You know, it's not as easy
to sleep your way to the top

140
00:07:24,179 --> 00:07:25,382
as it used to be.

141
00:07:25,502 --> 00:07:27,738
Sexual harassment
ruined everything.

142
00:07:28,575 --> 00:07:29,931
I'm sorry.

143
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:31,984
I just...

144
00:07:32,269 --> 00:07:34,930
don't know how to get
people to notice me.

145
00:07:35,977 --> 00:07:38,923
I'm actually not that bad of
an actress, you know.

146
00:07:39,528 --> 00:07:43,291
Not that acting has anything
to do with getting roles here.

147
00:07:43,411 --> 00:07:44,766
Then why stay?

148
00:07:46,188 --> 00:07:48,555
Why put yourself through
constant humiliation

149
00:07:48,675 --> 00:07:51,405
when you could go back
to your hometown and

150
00:07:51,789 --> 00:07:54,046
be homecoming queen again?

151
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,271
Be a ten.

152
00:07:56,896 --> 00:07:59,103
Because I told
everybody back home

153
00:07:59,223 --> 00:08:01,398
I was gonna make
something of myself.

154
00:08:01,934 --> 00:08:04,164
That some day they'd
be able to say

155
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:05,933
"I knew her when."

156
00:08:07,405 --> 00:08:10,195
If I return now,
I return a failure.

157
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:13,134
Then let's try this again,
shall we?

158
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:19,427
Tell me what you don't like
about yourself, Ms. Hayes.

159
00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:28,641
I am so happy that
we are doing a simple

160
00:08:28,761 --> 00:08:30,407
mammoplasty today,

161
00:08:30,527 --> 00:08:32,129
and nothing's
gonna go wrong.

162
00:08:32,249 --> 00:08:33,350
Right, Christian?

163
00:08:33,702 --> 00:08:34,955
Why would it?

164
00:08:35,075 --> 00:08:36,397
I don't know.

165
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:38,676
Maybe because
our surgical suite is

166
00:08:38,796 --> 00:08:41,046
directly over
the gates of hell.

167
00:08:42,343 --> 00:08:44,649
I promise you, nothing
will go wrong today.

168
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:46,189
Oh, that sounds so good.

169
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:47,913
We're just gonna
listen to the music,

170
00:08:48,033 --> 00:08:49,332
do our job,
go home.

171
00:08:49,452 --> 00:08:51,354
- Sounds good, right?
- Sounds good to me.

172
00:08:51,474 --> 00:08:53,215
- All right.
- Let's do it.

173
00:08:57,717 --> 00:09:00,677
She looks a lot like Kimber
under the mask, doesn't she?

174
00:09:00,797 --> 00:09:03,884
She's definitely not as hot,
but she's got the same color hair,

175
00:09:04,004 --> 00:09:05,737
same color of skin tone.

176
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,362
Same breast implants.

177
00:09:08,482 --> 00:09:09,846
You remember?

178
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,467
I gave Kimmy little Cs
for her first surgery.

179
00:09:12,587 --> 00:09:14,709
- They're our top seller.
- Yeah.

180
00:09:14,829 --> 00:09:16,721
There are a lot of girls
in the world

181
00:09:16,841 --> 00:09:19,108
who have bad
self-image problems, huh?

182
00:09:19,995 --> 00:09:21,033
Ten blade.

183
00:11:31,952 --> 00:11:34,295
Some serious shit
right here, Dr. Sean.

184
00:11:34,881 --> 00:11:37,110
What the hell am I
supposed to do with this?

185
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,205
Kill the wabbit,
asshole.

186
00:11:40,493 --> 00:11:42,886
I mean, you could try
to shoot me but...

187
00:11:43,957 --> 00:11:45,581
I'm already dead.

188
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,054
Come on, Sean, kill it.

189
00:11:50,174 --> 00:11:52,029
Goddamn it,
you're still such a pussy.

190
00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:54,305
50 years of school and
you still don't get it.

191
00:11:54,425 --> 00:11:56,589
I dropped out in the second
grade, and I even know.

192
00:11:56,709 --> 00:11:58,414
- This thing is a metaphor.
- For what?

193
00:11:58,534 --> 00:12:00,002
For that prick Christian

194
00:12:00,122 --> 00:12:01,736
and all that shit
he made you do.

195
00:12:01,737 --> 00:12:04,650
Silvio Perez,
his brother, me.

196
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:06,588
And that's just the big
ticket items, man.

197
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,644
You've been feeding him
little bites of your soul

198
00:12:08,764 --> 00:12:11,044
every day since the day you
met him, and then asking him,

199
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:13,233
"would you like
seconds, please?"

200
00:12:13,353 --> 00:12:15,813
I knew what I was doing.
I made my choices.

201
00:12:15,933 --> 00:12:17,732
Oh, like choosing
to keep your mouth shut

202
00:12:17,852 --> 00:12:20,302
when a poor little girl
needs a daddy to talk to?

203
00:12:20,422 --> 00:12:21,956
Come on, man.
Shoot him!

204
00:12:21,957 --> 00:12:23,713
Kill the douchebag
once and for all.

205
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,327
Be a man for once
in your waste of a life.

206
00:12:39,332 --> 00:12:41,706
Ok, doctor man,
let's cut this bad boy open

207
00:12:41,826 --> 00:12:43,533
and see what's
inside of him.

208
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:54,193
Have you seen Peter pan?

209
00:12:54,313 --> 00:12:55,736
That's you, dude.

210
00:12:55,856 --> 00:12:57,894
Taking people to Neverland

211
00:12:58,014 --> 00:12:59,967
so they never grow old.

212
00:13:00,087 --> 00:13:03,087
Hey, didn't he get eaten
by an alligator, too?

213
00:13:03,207 --> 00:13:04,797
Will you shut up?

214
00:13:13,224 --> 00:13:14,961
- It's Silvio's.
- Maybe.

215
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,412
My daughter has no one, Sean.

216
00:13:21,532 --> 00:13:23,279
Her whole family is gone.

217
00:13:23,749 --> 00:13:25,652
But she has the guts
to come to you,

218
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:28,514
look you in the eyes,
ask you for the truth.

219
00:13:28,634 --> 00:13:29,969
An innocent.

220
00:13:31,175 --> 00:13:32,765
She needs your help.

221
00:13:32,885 --> 00:13:34,790
You're the one who
got her into this.

222
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,143
You and my partner.

223
00:13:36,263 --> 00:13:37,738
Alligator boy?

224
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,177
You're right,
we did.

225
00:13:39,297 --> 00:13:41,001
We got both of you into it.

226
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:42,705
You are both innocents.

227
00:13:42,825 --> 00:13:44,289
And now I'm all taken care of,

228
00:13:44,409 --> 00:13:46,085
but what are you going
to do about him?

229
00:13:46,205 --> 00:13:47,571
What am I supposed to do?

230
00:13:47,691 --> 00:13:49,010
He's my best friend.

231
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,591
You've got 2 choices.

232
00:13:50,711 --> 00:13:51,676
Eat

233
00:13:53,517 --> 00:13:54,856
or be eaten.

234
00:14:31,968 --> 00:14:34,818
Hey. I'm looking
for Virginia Hayes.

235
00:14:35,437 --> 00:14:38,384
I'm Dr. Troy, Ms. Hayes'
surgeon. Can I help you?

236
00:14:38,504 --> 00:14:40,078
Is she still here?

237
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,446
Where do you keep them,
down here?

238
00:14:42,566 --> 00:14:44,167
I'm sorry, are you
a family member?

239
00:14:44,287 --> 00:14:46,581
Could be. Not sure exactly.
I'll tell you when I see her.

240
00:14:46,701 --> 00:14:48,637
No, no, no. Why don't you
just tell me right now?

241
00:14:48,757 --> 00:14:50,982
I'm the one getting
all of her bills.

242
00:14:51,102 --> 00:14:52,522
What the hell
does that mean?

243
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,766
I'm Virginia Hayes.

244
00:14:54,886 --> 00:14:58,437
The woman you gave
new tits to stole my identity.

245
00:15:01,155 --> 00:15:03,233
I'm sure it's just some kind
of misunderstanding.

246
00:15:03,353 --> 00:15:04,767
She tried to bang you,
didn't she?

247
00:15:04,887 --> 00:15:05,590
What?
No.

248
00:15:05,591 --> 00:15:07,053
The last time
I got this close,

249
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:09,377
the watch salesman had
screwed her on his Rolex display,

250
00:15:09,497 --> 00:15:10,900
so of course
he took her side.

251
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,727
Must be a pretty good lay.

252
00:15:12,847 --> 00:15:15,136
Virginia, dear,
you have a visitor.

253
00:15:15,256 --> 00:15:16,936
Where are you?

254
00:15:16,937 --> 00:15:18,881
She can't have gone
too far, trust me.

255
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,119
Linda, get your ass
in here.

256
00:15:23,401 --> 00:15:25,484
Dammit.
Thought I had her this time.

257
00:15:25,604 --> 00:15:26,843
Don't worry, Ms. Hayes.

258
00:15:26,963 --> 00:15:29,638
I'm sure that the credit card company
won't stick you with the bill.

259
00:15:29,758 --> 00:15:32,034
No, but they will
stick you with it.

260
00:15:32,154 --> 00:15:34,716
You know, the merchant's
the one who pays in fraud.

261
00:15:34,836 --> 00:15:37,797
Not the victim
and not the creditor.

262
00:15:41,446 --> 00:15:44,238
Her Lexus,
it's not in the structure.

263
00:15:44,929 --> 00:15:46,134
She drives

264
00:15:46,952 --> 00:15:48,075
a Lexus.

265
00:15:48,843 --> 00:15:53,276
A $600 a month Lexus

266
00:15:53,396 --> 00:15:54,835
while I drive

267
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:58,232
a piece of shit '87 Corolla.

268
00:16:00,023 --> 00:16:02,831
How did you find out
she had the operation?

269
00:16:02,951 --> 00:16:05,492
Oh, I got a guy.
A private dick.

270
00:16:05,612 --> 00:16:08,425
He's been searching for her
for 3 years now.

271
00:16:08,545 --> 00:16:11,952
I mean, that is how long
I have known about this bitch.

272
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:13,880
And you don't know
her real name?

273
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,680
No. No, no, no.
No, she's that good.

274
00:16:17,082 --> 00:16:20,393
No, she just uses my name
every once in a while. 

275
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:22,924
So it's almost like
I forget about her,

276
00:16:23,044 --> 00:16:25,455
and then something
pops up again.

277
00:16:25,575 --> 00:16:26,915
3 weeks ago

278
00:16:27,035 --> 00:16:29,405
I get my first bill from
that Lexus dealer,

279
00:16:29,525 --> 00:16:31,316
so I call my P.I.,

280
00:16:31,317 --> 00:16:33,448
he starts keeping an eye
out for everything

281
00:16:33,568 --> 00:16:35,247
with my social
security number on it,

282
00:16:35,367 --> 00:16:37,674
calls me this morning,
and says

283
00:16:37,794 --> 00:16:41,090
she got a new card and
it was used here yesterday.

284
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:44,570
Can't you just cancel your
credit cards and move on?

285
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:45,630
No.

286
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,689
You can't just
go on with your life.

287
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:51,370
My life is totally screwed.

288
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:53,470
I can't get a job, ok,

289
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:55,968
because she got caught
shoplifting 2 years ago

290
00:16:56,088 --> 00:16:57,511
and she used my name.

291
00:16:57,631 --> 00:16:59,261
Me and my husband divorced

292
00:16:59,381 --> 00:17:01,303
so we could keep
his assets separate,

293
00:17:01,423 --> 00:17:03,758
then the asshole realizes
he's got a free pass

294
00:17:03,878 --> 00:17:05,933
to screwing around.
So now he's gone.

295
00:17:06,053 --> 00:17:07,528
Not that I blame him

296
00:17:07,648 --> 00:17:09,617
because I'm in this
pissy mood all the time

297
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,605
because I spend
most of my time on hold

298
00:17:11,725 --> 00:17:15,995
trying to clear my name
with one credit bureau or another.

299
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,524
Well, Ms. Hayes,

300
00:17:20,445 --> 00:17:23,067
I don't know how we can help,
but if there's anything...

301
00:17:23,187 --> 00:17:24,655
anything we can do.

302
00:17:24,775 --> 00:17:27,749
You can stop
being enamored

303
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:30,224
with every little ingenue

304
00:17:30,344 --> 00:17:32,501
that walks
through your doors.

305
00:17:32,621 --> 00:17:35,230
Ok, I have heard her story.

306
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:39,196
She plays the victim
and guys fall at her feet.

307
00:17:39,316 --> 00:17:42,794
So here's what
you can do, Dr. Troy.

308
00:17:42,914 --> 00:17:46,217
Stop being
such a chump.

309
00:18:20,494 --> 00:18:22,959
My daughter used
to love to swing.

310
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:25,291
The higher I'd push her,

311
00:18:25,411 --> 00:18:27,519
the more she'd beg me
not to stop.

312
00:18:28,456 --> 00:18:31,011
My father and I could
never play outside.

313
00:18:31,948 --> 00:18:33,303
Too dangerous.

314
00:18:34,308 --> 00:18:38,322
It was years before I realized
he was worried about his safety,

315
00:18:38,442 --> 00:18:39,680
not mine.

316
00:18:41,923 --> 00:18:44,750
Thank you, Dr. McNamara,
for calling me.

317
00:18:46,514 --> 00:18:49,715
I was surprised, actually,
to hear from you.

318
00:18:51,634 --> 00:18:54,462
Your visit took us
a bit by surprise, too.

319
00:19:00,212 --> 00:19:02,890
Your instinct was right
about your uncle.

320
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:04,446
He did...

321
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:10,050
He molested you
when you were young.

322
00:19:13,347 --> 00:19:14,536
How young?

323
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:16,795
6.

324
00:19:20,601 --> 00:19:24,752
Silvio offered us a lot money
to do a facial reconstruction.

325
00:19:25,857 --> 00:19:28,533
We had no idea
why he wanted it, what...

326
00:19:28,653 --> 00:19:30,428
So you did his surgery?

327
00:19:31,064 --> 00:19:31,884
Yeah.

328
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,058
And then he wanted
another one.

329
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:37,939
Your father
tracked him down.

330
00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:41,294
He wanted vengeance for
what Silvio had done to you.

331
00:19:42,398 --> 00:19:44,106
So he killed this man?

332
00:19:45,228 --> 00:19:47,169
One monster killed another?

333
00:19:47,289 --> 00:19:48,627
No.
Actually, no.

334
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,161
He would have,

335
00:19:51,281 --> 00:19:54,140
but Silvio's brother
Alejandro got there first.

336
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:57,236
He broke into
our surgical suite

337
00:19:57,638 --> 00:19:59,345
and he held him down

338
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:01,304
while he turned up
the anesthesia.

339
00:20:01,424 --> 00:20:02,892
They were enemies?

340
00:20:02,893 --> 00:20:05,610
No, I think Alejandro
loved his brother, but

341
00:20:06,547 --> 00:20:07,815
he was frightened.

342
00:20:07,935 --> 00:20:10,727
He knew what Silvio
had done to you and

343
00:20:12,099 --> 00:20:15,450
when he found out his wife was
about to have a baby girl,

344
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:17,686
he didn't want
to take any chances.

345
00:20:19,436 --> 00:20:21,249
By the time
your father got there,

346
00:20:21,369 --> 00:20:22,708
Silvio was dead.

347
00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:25,176
And you never
went to the police?

348
00:20:25,296 --> 00:20:26,935
He died on our table.

349
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,027
If we'd have reported it,

350
00:20:29,147 --> 00:20:30,901
we would have lost
our medical license.

351
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:33,316
We had no choice but
to dispose of Silvio's body.

352
00:20:33,436 --> 00:20:34,741
You had a choice.

353
00:20:36,181 --> 00:20:37,595
You made it.

354
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:41,077
Yeah.

355
00:20:44,257 --> 00:20:45,144
Yeah.

356
00:20:47,922 --> 00:20:49,596
Alejandro

357
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:52,518
followed us to the swamp
where we dumped it and

358
00:20:54,108 --> 00:20:56,725
soon after your father
killed him.

359
00:20:57,489 --> 00:21:00,587
To get rid of the evidence
for our sake, he said.

360
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:07,384
Thank you,
Dr. McNamara,

361
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:10,459
for telling me the truth.

362
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,680
I was born into the world
of Escobar Gallardo.

363
00:21:17,806 --> 00:21:20,082
Evil and violence
was all I knew.

364
00:21:22,074 --> 00:21:24,148
Maybe now
I caput it behind me,

365
00:21:24,268 --> 00:21:25,554
start fresh.

366
00:21:27,144 --> 00:21:28,299
Me, too.

367
00:21:49,794 --> 00:21:51,110
That's some kid.

368
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:53,637
Takes after the old man,
don't she, Sean?

369
00:21:57,252 --> 00:21:58,390
Thank you.

370
00:22:00,918 --> 00:22:02,341
I got you!

371
00:22:17,872 --> 00:22:20,397
That's taking
a really long time.

372
00:22:20,517 --> 00:22:22,740
It takes longer
if you keep interrupting.

373
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,781
Look,

374
00:22:25,153 --> 00:22:27,028
I am in a lot of pain.

375
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:29,630
Is there anything
you can do to

376
00:22:29,631 --> 00:22:30,798
hurry it up?

377
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,197
Try these.

378
00:22:33,586 --> 00:22:35,177
They should ease the pain.

379
00:22:35,297 --> 00:22:37,419
At least until
the cops get here.

380
00:22:37,754 --> 00:22:39,009
Thanks, Mort.

381
00:22:42,139 --> 00:22:43,478
How did you find me?

382
00:22:43,479 --> 00:22:45,359
I called every pharmacy
in the area.

383
00:22:45,479 --> 00:22:48,078
I asked them to contact me
if a new c-cup tried

384
00:22:48,198 --> 00:22:50,356
to fill up
the prescription I wrote.

385
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:53,637
I'm serious
about the pills.

386
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:56,474
Who knows what
they'll give you in jail.

387
00:22:58,817 --> 00:23:01,270
Please,
don't call the police.

388
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:03,131
Why?

389
00:23:03,251 --> 00:23:05,089
You have
a check for me?

390
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:07,769
I don't have
anything anymore.

391
00:23:09,828 --> 00:23:11,401
I'm really sorry.

392
00:23:12,288 --> 00:23:15,196
I... I never imagined
that this would happen.

393
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:18,853
You stole that woman's
social security, her credit cards,

394
00:23:18,973 --> 00:23:21,069
skipped out
on a $5,000 procedure.

395
00:23:21,189 --> 00:23:22,776
What did you think
would happen?

396
00:23:22,896 --> 00:23:23,730
I meant

397
00:23:24,232 --> 00:23:26,216
I never imagined that...

398
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:30,557
my life could end up
to be such a failure.

399
00:23:31,563 --> 00:23:33,141
What do you think,
Mort, huh?

400
00:23:33,261 --> 00:23:34,881
Surprised she doesn't
get more jobs.

401
00:23:35,001 --> 00:23:36,688
She's one hell of an actress.

402
00:23:37,157 --> 00:23:39,799
Wait.
I'm not an actress.

403
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,845
Look,
it was all a lie.

404
00:23:41,965 --> 00:23:44,557
I'm just Marcy Hamels
from des moines.

405
00:23:44,677 --> 00:23:47,157
I came out here to get
my real estate license,

406
00:23:47,277 --> 00:23:49,857
but I failed the exam.
I have dyslexia.

407
00:23:49,977 --> 00:23:52,063
And then I had this problem
with my job where

408
00:23:52,183 --> 00:23:54,607
I got these headaches
and I couldn't focus.

409
00:23:54,727 --> 00:23:56,280
And the temp agency fired me.

410
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,021
And everything just
went to shit.

411
00:23:58,141 --> 00:23:59,644
I didn't know
what else to do.

412
00:23:59,764 --> 00:24:00,945
You didn't know
what else to do,

413
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:02,836
so you decided to get
breast implants, huh?

414
00:24:02,956 --> 00:24:03,656
Yes.

415
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:06,498
I thought a new body
might get me a new life.

416
00:24:06,966 --> 00:24:09,663
And everyone out here
who's anyone has them.

417
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:11,278
I was just trying to fit in.

418
00:24:11,398 --> 00:24:14,751
You do realize what you did
to the real Virginia, don't you?

419
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:20,041
I feel horrible.

420
00:24:23,064 --> 00:24:26,512
I always told myself that
I'd find a way to pay her back.

421
00:24:28,628 --> 00:24:30,198
You don't have to do that.

422
00:24:30,318 --> 00:24:32,096
No. No,
I want to.

423
00:24:32,216 --> 00:24:34,225
No, I mean,
you don't have to do that

424
00:24:34,345 --> 00:24:36,956
because you don't have
to pay for the procedure.

425
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:40,383
If you had told me your story,
we could have

426
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:42,157
worked something out.

427
00:24:45,169 --> 00:24:46,879
- Really?
- Of course.

428
00:24:47,749 --> 00:24:49,828
Matter of fact,
if you come back in,

429
00:24:49,948 --> 00:24:52,229
I'll lipo away
a few pounds for free.

430
00:24:52,836 --> 00:24:54,723
Why would you do that?

431
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:57,117
I became a surgeon to...

432
00:24:57,237 --> 00:24:59,945
change people's lives.
And well...

433
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:05,399
You look like
you could use a little help.

434
00:25:22,671 --> 00:25:25,485
What are you doing?
I thought she was having lipo.

435
00:25:25,605 --> 00:25:26,960
So did she.

436
00:25:27,329 --> 00:25:29,080
Thank God she's lonely
and desperate enough

437
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,876
to fall for the grade-a bullshit
I fed her in the pharmacy, huh?

438
00:25:31,996 --> 00:25:34,127
She actually thought
that I cared about her.

439
00:25:34,247 --> 00:25:37,563
These C-cups right here, they're
the property of McNamara/Troy.

440
00:25:37,683 --> 00:25:39,396
I'm repossessing them.

441
00:25:39,998 --> 00:25:42,208
You can't foreclose implants.

442
00:25:43,078 --> 00:25:44,367
Watch me.

443
00:25:45,789 --> 00:25:47,385
Why don't you just go
to the police?

444
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:50,048
What, and lose all
the personal satisfaction?

445
00:25:50,168 --> 00:25:51,936
I'm tired of being taken
advantage of.

446
00:25:52,056 --> 00:25:54,936
This bitch is just the last
in a long line of gold diggers

447
00:25:55,056 --> 00:25:57,129
who have tried
to milk me dry.

448
00:26:00,148 --> 00:26:02,841
You don't know what it's like
to be taken advantage of, ok.

449
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:04,830
I feel like a goddamn
Chinese buffet.

450
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:05,878
I get it.

451
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:07,970
I do, I get it.

452
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:10,790
You dealt with the pain of
Kimber's death with her mother,

453
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,639
but you haven't dealt
with your rage.

454
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:14,326
And it's normal to be angry.

455
00:26:14,446 --> 00:26:16,194
Especially when
you didn't get a warning,

456
00:26:16,314 --> 00:26:18,482
you didn't get a note.
You had no closure.

457
00:26:18,483 --> 00:26:19,900
But I'm telling you right now,

458
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,765
this is not gonna
give you closure.

459
00:26:22,287 --> 00:26:23,934
I don't give a damn
why I'm doing it.

460
00:26:24,054 --> 00:26:26,256
All I know is that
I feel much better.

461
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:28,967
Linda, close this bitch up
for me, would you?

462
00:26:53,303 --> 00:26:55,161
Looking for these?

463
00:26:57,671 --> 00:26:59,796
- You took them out?
- I took them back.

464
00:26:59,916 --> 00:27:02,859
But, you told me that
you wanted to help.

465
00:27:04,969 --> 00:27:06,508
You lied to me.

466
00:27:06,628 --> 00:27:08,918
That makes us even
then, doesn't it?

467
00:27:12,166 --> 00:27:14,191
How could you be so cruel?

468
00:27:14,311 --> 00:27:16,885
Cruel would be
calling the police.

469
00:27:18,151 --> 00:27:20,399
Let's face it, you'd be
qualified for social security

470
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:22,232
by the time
you got out of jail.

471
00:27:22,352 --> 00:27:24,558
Given the grief and
the financial hardship

472
00:27:24,678 --> 00:27:26,667
you cause me
in the routh Virginia.

473
00:27:26,787 --> 00:27:28,728
what I did was generous.

474
00:27:29,331 --> 00:27:31,054
You should feel lucky.

475
00:27:32,527 --> 00:27:34,921
You're welcome to stay
the recommended 48 hours

476
00:27:35,041 --> 00:27:36,880
for recovery, I'll make sure
you're treated well.

477
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,152
Not any pain.

478
00:27:38,272 --> 00:27:40,913
But live what happend,
nothing is fair.

479
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,269
You're right.

480
00:27:46,867 --> 00:27:49,709
I also got you some pamphlets
for some woman's shelters.

481
00:27:49,829 --> 00:27:52,606
You're welcome to use
the phone here if you'd like.

482
00:27:52,726 --> 00:27:55,189
They'll help you
get back on your feet...

483
00:27:56,209 --> 00:27:57,832
In an honest way.

484
00:28:00,091 --> 00:28:01,954
In the meantime,
if you feel any pain at all,

485
00:28:02,074 --> 00:28:03,779
just go ahead and
press that button.

486
00:28:03,899 --> 00:28:05,970
Be careful, it's morphine,
so don't overdo it.

487
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,345
Hang in there.

488
00:28:08,499 --> 00:28:09,705
Dr. Troy?

489
00:28:10,692 --> 00:28:12,425
Could I ask you
for one more favor?

490
00:28:12,545 --> 00:28:13,864
Are you kidding me?

491
00:28:14,628 --> 00:28:16,753
Could you give me
Virginia's number?

492
00:28:17,958 --> 00:28:19,864
I want to call her myself.

493
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,324
Tell her I'm sorry.

494
00:28:25,731 --> 00:28:28,041
She's only gonna
call the police.

495
00:28:30,068 --> 00:28:30,904
Well,

496
00:28:32,745 --> 00:28:34,804
if that's what she does.

497
00:28:36,595 --> 00:28:40,445
There's probably already
a warrant for my arrest.

498
00:28:40,897 --> 00:28:41,800
Right?

499
00:28:44,262 --> 00:28:45,182
And...

500
00:28:46,103 --> 00:28:48,345
if I'm gonna start
a new life,

501
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:52,380
I can't stay on the run.

502
00:28:53,267 --> 00:28:55,873
Who knows, maybe
she'll be nice like you were

503
00:28:55,993 --> 00:28:57,869
and we'll
work something out.

504
00:29:05,383 --> 00:29:07,375
I'll leave her number
right here.

505
00:29:08,764 --> 00:29:10,492
Get some rest first,
though.

506
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,133
You look like
you need it.

507
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,204
Christian,

508
00:29:21,606 --> 00:29:24,552
this is special agent
Reynolds and agent Ryan

509
00:29:24,672 --> 00:29:25,857
from the FBI.

510
00:29:26,292 --> 00:29:27,624
What are the feds doing here?

511
00:29:27,744 --> 00:29:30,594
We're not pressing any charges
against Ms. Hamels.

512
00:29:30,714 --> 00:29:31,914
I'm sorry?

513
00:29:31,915 --> 00:29:34,228
There must be some
sort of confusion.

514
00:29:34,348 --> 00:29:37,085
We're here to talk to you
about Silvio Perez.

515
00:29:39,428 --> 00:29:42,607
She's an interesting girl,
wise beyond her years.

516
00:29:42,727 --> 00:29:45,309
Makes sense growing up
in a family like that.

517
00:29:45,429 --> 00:29:48,745
Did she say anything about why
she would make up a story like this?

518
00:29:48,865 --> 00:29:50,613
Said she wanted
to change her identity.

519
00:29:50,733 --> 00:29:53,525
Said she was raised by killers,
surrounded by evil.

520
00:29:53,974 --> 00:29:55,165
Kid's full of guilt.

521
00:29:55,285 --> 00:29:56,725
She kept going on
about how her braces

522
00:29:56,845 --> 00:29:58,583
were paid for with
the blood of innocents.

523
00:29:58,703 --> 00:30:00,706
She said she couldn't be
a good person

524
00:30:00,826 --> 00:30:02,829
and let a bad deed
go unpunished.

525
00:30:02,949 --> 00:30:05,379
We were gonna ask you
the same question, though.

526
00:30:05,499 --> 00:30:06,585
Oh, I have no idea.

527
00:30:06,705 --> 00:30:08,607
She came in for a consult
the other day,

528
00:30:08,727 --> 00:30:11,240
asked us about
this Silvio Perez.

529
00:30:11,941 --> 00:30:13,994
We told her we didn't know
anything, and she left.

530
00:30:14,114 --> 00:30:15,658
The kid's loco.

531
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:17,293
We're plastic surgeons.

532
00:30:17,294 --> 00:30:20,346
Who do have a number of
connections to Escobar Gallardo.

533
00:30:20,681 --> 00:30:23,889
Let's not forget that he was
last seen in your offices

534
00:30:24,009 --> 00:30:26,319
and that he left a trail
of dead peace officers

535
00:30:26,439 --> 00:30:28,721
as payment
for services rendered.

536
00:30:28,841 --> 00:30:31,078
Which is probably why
she's fixated on us.

537
00:30:31,198 --> 00:30:33,837
We were very transparent
in our dealings with Escobar.

538
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,259
What about Silvio Perez?

539
00:30:35,379 --> 00:30:36,959
First time we hard
the name was

540
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:39,198
when she mentioned it
in the consult.

541
00:30:39,469 --> 00:30:41,092
That true for all of you?

542
00:30:41,588 --> 00:30:43,235
Yes, it is.

543
00:30:44,305 --> 00:30:45,276
Well,

544
00:30:45,728 --> 00:30:47,672
we're sorry to have
taken up your time.

545
00:30:47,792 --> 00:30:50,108
You should know we've
started an active investigation.

546
00:30:50,228 --> 00:30:51,932
Probably won't go
anywhere, but

547
00:30:52,052 --> 00:30:55,282
anything related to the war on drugs
gives our bosses hard-ons.

548
00:30:55,402 --> 00:30:57,916
We'd like copies of all your records
from the time in question.

549
00:30:58,036 --> 00:30:59,060
Oh, that's ok.

550
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,484
I mean, it'll take a few days
because, you know,

551
00:31:01,604 --> 00:31:04,782
things got mixed up when
we moved here from Miami.

552
00:31:04,902 --> 00:31:05,968
Well, just

553
00:31:06,671 --> 00:31:08,026
call my office.

554
00:31:08,415 --> 00:31:10,135
We'll send a courier.

555
00:31:11,051 --> 00:31:13,065
We'll be sure
to keep this quiet.

556
00:31:13,185 --> 00:31:14,142
Thanks.

557
00:31:14,262 --> 00:31:17,974
And remember, we offer
a 20% off to law enforcement.

558
00:31:25,448 --> 00:31:26,853
Am I dreaming?

559
00:31:27,516 --> 00:31:29,334
Would someone tell me
if I'm dreaming?

560
00:31:29,335 --> 00:31:31,012
I never thought
she'd go to the police.

561
00:31:31,132 --> 00:31:32,262
Are you out of
your goddamn mind?

562
00:31:32,382 --> 00:31:33,405
I mean, how could you
be so stupid?

563
00:31:33,406 --> 00:31:35,802
I'm gonna check on the files
and see if there's anything in there.

564
00:31:35,922 --> 00:31:37,578
Lizzie, you get that
shredder humming.

565
00:31:37,698 --> 00:31:40,123
And remember, when
in doubt, Chuck it out.

566
00:31:42,648 --> 00:31:44,158
I'm sorry, Christian.

567
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:47,315
I honestly thought
that girl deserves someone

568
00:31:47,435 --> 00:31:50,210
in her life who is willing
to tell her the truth.

569
00:31:52,224 --> 00:31:54,341
Don't you apologize to him.

570
00:31:54,461 --> 00:31:56,127
You don't owe him Jack shit.

571
00:31:56,128 --> 00:31:57,762
Well, Mr. Holier-than-thou,

572
00:31:57,763 --> 00:31:59,944
I don't intend to spend
the rest of my life in prison,

573
00:32:00,064 --> 00:32:01,994
so shut your mouth or
have your moral crisis

574
00:32:02,114 --> 00:32:03,534
at some other point
in time.

575
00:32:03,535 --> 00:32:06,049
Do you hear the way he talks to you?
It's only going to get worse.

576
00:32:06,169 --> 00:32:08,433
He has absolutely
no respect for you, Sean.

577
00:32:08,553 --> 00:32:10,893
I never wanted anything
to do with that Perez case,

578
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:11,942
if you recall.

579
00:32:11,943 --> 00:32:13,874
You think your shit doesn't
stink as bad as mine?

580
00:32:13,994 --> 00:32:15,881
After all these years,
I'm sure it does.

581
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:18,036
I don't know how much longer
I can live with it.

582
00:32:18,156 --> 00:32:20,469
That's a start.
Now get up in his face.

583
00:32:23,866 --> 00:32:26,727
Say, "I ain't gonna pay
for your shit, Christian.

584
00:32:27,264 --> 00:32:29,740
Your ass is the only one
that's gonna fry.

585
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,468
I'm the bad ass now,

586
00:32:31,588 --> 00:32:33,660
 and I'm gonna
take care of Sean.

587
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:36,931
And there ain't nothing
you can do about it, lizardman."

588
00:32:37,051 --> 00:32:38,687
Now all you have to do

589
00:32:38,807 --> 00:32:40,613
is drop a dime
on him, baby.

590
00:32:41,031 --> 00:32:44,170
You know it's his fault.
Your word against his.

591
00:32:44,572 --> 00:32:46,856
Who do you think
they're gonna believe?

592
00:32:47,961 --> 00:32:49,745
We're gonna get through this.

593
00:32:49,746 --> 00:32:51,295
It's her word against ours.

594
00:32:51,415 --> 00:32:53,546
Who do you think
they're gonna believe?

595
00:32:54,249 --> 00:32:57,519
You need to find a better way
to deal with your stinky shit.

596
00:33:11,395 --> 00:33:12,750
Hello, Marcy.

597
00:33:17,134 --> 00:33:18,206
Virginia?

598
00:33:19,695 --> 00:33:21,185
I finally found you.

599
00:33:23,879 --> 00:33:25,787
You got my message.

600
00:33:29,419 --> 00:33:31,213
I didn't realize
you'd be

601
00:33:31,481 --> 00:33:33,288
stopping by tonight.

602
00:33:35,023 --> 00:33:36,150
Yeah.

603
00:33:36,947 --> 00:33:38,158
I had to.

604
00:33:39,284 --> 00:33:41,685
I mean,
things like this just

605
00:33:42,405 --> 00:33:44,480
can't be done
over the phone.

606
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,734
You're right.

607
00:33:50,864 --> 00:33:52,889
And I'm glad you're here.

608
00:34:01,515 --> 00:34:04,332
I hope you can find
some way to forgive me.

609
00:34:11,825 --> 00:34:12,717
Never!

610
00:34:14,061 --> 00:34:15,451
Never!

611
00:34:16,007 --> 00:34:17,275
You hear me?

612
00:34:51,166 --> 00:34:52,421
Knock knock.

613
00:34:55,601 --> 00:34:57,960
You, uh,
sleep ok last night?

614
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:01,290
Yeah, well, me neither.

615
00:35:02,649 --> 00:35:04,269
Not to make excuses,

616
00:35:04,389 --> 00:35:05,776
but I've had a really

617
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:08,630
tough couple
of weeks lately.

618
00:35:09,048 --> 00:35:11,458
I lost somebody
very close to me. And, um,

619
00:35:12,295 --> 00:35:15,209
well, look, the point is,
I haven't been myself.

620
00:35:16,046 --> 00:35:17,259
You were right.

621
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:19,188
I was cruel,
and I'm sorry. I just...

622
00:35:19,308 --> 00:35:20,801
right or wrong,
you're

623
00:35:20,921 --> 00:35:23,743
just trying to make
yourself feel better. And I...

624
00:35:24,245 --> 00:35:26,103
understand that impulse.

625
00:35:54,548 --> 00:35:57,524
You're lucky we never backed
up our files online in Miami.

626
00:35:57,644 --> 00:36:00,417
All we have are these hard copies,
and they're incomplete.

627
00:36:00,537 --> 00:36:01,558
We have a problem.

628
00:36:01,678 --> 00:36:03,503
I doubt it.
I don't think Silvio Perez

629
00:36:03,623 --> 00:36:05,193
even put his name
on the patient...

630
00:36:05,313 --> 00:36:06,985
It's not Silvio,
it's Marcy Hamels.

631
00:36:07,105 --> 00:36:08,210
The i.d. Thief?

632
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:10,049
Yeah, she's dead
in the recovery suite.

633
00:36:10,169 --> 00:36:11,352
She what?

634
00:36:11,472 --> 00:36:13,471
She's dead
in the recovery room.

635
00:36:13,856 --> 00:36:16,501
I tricked her into going
under so that I could

636
00:36:16,786 --> 00:36:18,239
repossess her breasts.

637
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:19,293
Are you insane?

638
00:36:19,413 --> 00:36:21,947
Maybe she had an adverse
reaction to the anesthesia

639
00:36:22,067 --> 00:36:23,718
or O.D'd on
the morphine drip.

640
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:25,717
Or maybe she was struck
by a bolt of lightning.

641
00:36:25,837 --> 00:36:28,175
It doesn't matter.
She's dead in our offices.

642
00:36:28,295 --> 00:36:29,974
And when the police
come to investigate,

643
00:36:30,094 --> 00:36:31,865
they're gonna find out
you operated on her

644
00:36:31,985 --> 00:36:33,553
against her will.

645
00:36:33,673 --> 00:36:35,181
Why do the police
have to know?

646
00:36:35,301 --> 00:36:36,386
No way, Christian.

647
00:36:36,506 --> 00:36:38,154
We're not going down
that road again.

648
00:36:38,274 --> 00:36:40,303
This time we do it
by the book.

649
00:36:40,304 --> 00:36:41,671
We have a code blue.

650
00:36:41,672 --> 00:36:43,254
Marcy Hamels flat-lined
in recovery.

651
00:36:43,374 --> 00:36:44,255
We know.

652
00:36:44,375 --> 00:36:47,187
Well, why aren't you guys
doing anything? Let's go.

653
00:36:48,677 --> 00:36:50,426
What's going on in here?

654
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,854
What happened to Marcy?

655
00:36:53,974 --> 00:36:55,578
Maybe her numbers were off.

656
00:36:55,698 --> 00:36:57,300
Are you trying
to pin this on me?

657
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,729
Did you know he was operating
on this woman against her will?

658
00:36:59,849 --> 00:37:01,981
No, I did not know.
I did not know at first.

659
00:37:02,101 --> 00:37:03,706
No, but it's not
like you tried

660
00:37:03,826 --> 00:37:06,303
to bring her out once
you found out, right?

661
00:37:07,355 --> 00:37:08,486
What are you saying?

662
00:37:08,606 --> 00:37:10,023
What I'm saying is that
we're all in this together.

663
00:37:10,143 --> 00:37:11,432
Together?
What did I do?

664
00:37:11,433 --> 00:37:13,176
You?
You're McNamara/Troy.

665
00:37:13,296 --> 00:37:15,296
Ok, every little piece
of every little thing

666
00:37:15,416 --> 00:37:17,134
is gonna have
your name on it as well.

667
00:37:17,254 --> 00:37:19,595
You try rebuilding your business
after that kind of press.

668
00:37:19,715 --> 00:37:21,835
And that's if
we don't go to jail.

669
00:37:21,955 --> 00:37:23,309
What are you suggesting?

670
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:24,648
I'm suggesting

671
00:37:25,602 --> 00:37:28,087
that we take care
of this ourselves.

672
00:37:28,438 --> 00:37:30,111
We've done it before.

673
00:37:30,697 --> 00:37:32,634
I mean, who is
this Marcy Hamels anyway?

674
00:37:32,754 --> 00:37:34,732
Nobody knows her.
She's got no family, no friends.

675
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:35,789
No, not again.

676
00:37:35,909 --> 00:37:37,978
We've had Silvio Perez
on our backs for 10 years.

677
00:37:38,098 --> 00:37:41,202
- We don't have a choice.
- You don't have a choice, I do!

678
00:37:42,136 --> 00:37:44,211
And I can do
the right thing here.

679
00:37:45,149 --> 00:37:46,906
Call them.
Be a big man.

680
00:37:47,574 --> 00:37:48,843
I'm sure you'll make
your kids proud,

681
00:37:48,963 --> 00:37:51,118
especially when you can't afford
to pay for their education anymore.

682
00:37:51,238 --> 00:37:52,004
I mean, Conor,
he's so young,

683
00:37:52,005 --> 00:37:53,912
he'll only remember you
as the unemployed asshole

684
00:37:54,032 --> 00:37:55,304
you're about to become,

685
00:37:55,424 --> 00:37:58,283
but you would have done
the right thing. That's good.

686
00:38:00,844 --> 00:38:02,133
Fix this.

687
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,723
This is your mess. We should
have brought your car.

688
00:38:53,843 --> 00:38:54,915
Oh, yeah,
that's a great idea.

689
00:38:55,035 --> 00:38:57,480
Nobody would notice a Bordeaux
Pontevecchio-colored Maserati

690
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,059
out in the middle
of the desert.

691
00:38:59,179 --> 00:39:01,438
Yeah, that wouldn't
draw any attention.

692
00:39:03,222 --> 00:39:06,818
All right, it's deep enough.
Let's get it over with.

693
00:39:07,217 --> 00:39:08,238
Come on.

694
00:39:12,185 --> 00:39:13,268
Put these on.

695
00:39:13,388 --> 00:39:15,929
Maybe it'll keep us
