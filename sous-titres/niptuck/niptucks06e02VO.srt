00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,290
previously on "nip/tuck"...

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,460
We're still friends.

3
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:06,110
No, we're not friends.I'm your wife.

4
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:07,310
That's liz's attorney.

5
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,170
She's suing me for divorce.Just calm down!

6
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:12,980
You know what'll calm me down?A boat--yours.

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,950
Sean mcnamara, will you marry me?

8
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,280
Yes.

9
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,550
What is going on with you?

10
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,700
I haven't been able to sleep.

11
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:22,640
Sean.

12
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,030
Sean?

13
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:27,740
Sean!

14
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,220
Wake up, sean! Shit.

15
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:36,770
Christian!

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,320
Christian!

17
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,590
Christian!

18
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,090
Christian, get up!

19
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:42,630
What happened?

20
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,900
I don't know.I woke up, and he was like this.

21
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,380
Sean.

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,030
Sean!

23
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,180
Call 911. Go.

24
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:55,760
Jesus.

25
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,400
Jesus.

26
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:02,740
Come on.

27
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:04,570
Did you see him take those pills?

28
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,300
No, I didn'T.I didn't even know.

29
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,180
We're gonna have to pump his stomach.

30
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,960
- Paramedics are coming.
- No, we don't have time for that, all right?

31
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,880
Just maintain his airway.

32
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,830
Come on, sean.

33
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,740
Come on, sean.

34
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:27,280
Hold his mouth.Keep it open.

35
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,640
- Ok?
- ok.

36
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:57,490
He was already given a gastric levage.
What the hell is taking so long?

37
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,720
Christian, it's only been 10 minutes.

38
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,120
Did I ask you?

39
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,210
Look. I am as worried about him as you are.

40
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,430
Really, sweetheart?
Is that why you gave him prescription sleeping pills?

41
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,140
I gave him a prescription because he couldn't sleep.

42
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,730
How was I supposed to know he'd abuse it?

43
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,880
Do you have any idea what kind of stress he's been under?

44
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,360
Do you?

45
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,060
I thought that was just him.

46
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,180
Oh, beautiful.That's why he's living
the lifestyles of the rich and

47
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,800
famous with you and trying to pay child support

48
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,020
and trying to keep the business from going under.

49
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,620
He told me you were purposely cutting back.

50
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,770
We did an infomercial for
vaginal rejuvenation, for god's sake.

51
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,960
We got another surgeon in so that
we could get an extra 10%.Are you blind?

52
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,570
He's hanging on by a thread.

53
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,410
Something must have happened.

54
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,130
I proposed to him.

55
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,440
You what?

56
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,880
I proposed to him.

57
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,360
Oh, gee, no pressure there.

58
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:54,390
Miss.Come on, help me out here.

62
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,160
You know what? You can get some rest.

63
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,840
- I can take care of this consult. - I'm fine.

64
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,270
You're blowing the whole thing out of proportion.

65
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,660
I took one sleeping pill, i still couldn't sleep,

66
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,330
so I took another one, that's all.

67
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,200
It could have happened to anybody.

68
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,780
Anybody who washes pills down with a fifth of glen kella.

69
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,530
I said I'm fine.

70
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,220
Let's drop it.

71
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,950
Tell us what you don't like about yourself, jared.

72
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,300
My name's enigma.

73
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:18,240
Jared chose that name
because he says it expresses how he feels,

74
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,940
and it's pretty descriptive for us, too.

75
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:24,050
Well, tell us about your scarification.

76
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,860
Skin was professionally removed by a scalpel.

77
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,520
Lasers won't fix these.

78
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:32,750
We should be able to remove them with
skin grafts or z-plasty incisions.

79
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,650
Oh, thank god.

80
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,340
Well, that's a start.

81
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,870
Turn around, jared.Show the doctors what else you've done.

82
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,880
Please turn around, enigma.

83
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,220
Can you do anything about that horrible thing, doctors?

84
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,270
It looks like it was well done,

85
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,770
meaning all the ink is at the same level.

86
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,100
It makes laser removal much easier.

87
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,860
It should take about 6 to 8 treatments, and after that,

88
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,480
with the hair regrowing, it should be unnoticeable.

89
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,850
Enigma, do you want these procedures?

90
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,490
No.

91
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:21,590
The way I look is the way I feel inside.

92
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,300
I don't want to change a thing.

93
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,450
Well, I'm sorry, mr. And mrs.Mccloud,
but if your son doesn't want these removed,

94
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,140
you can't force him to, even though he is a minor.

95
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:36,300
We're fully aware of that, dr. Troy.I'm a criminal attorney.

96
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,380
But enigma, garth, and I have a contract.

97
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:41,040
It's something that we all agreed upoN.

98
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,880
They agreed to send me to military school
if I don't have them removed.

99
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,220
Don't make it sound so one-sided, son.

100
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,560
We agreed to let you listen to the music that you like.

101
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,950
I said that I would call you enigma until your 18th birthday.

102
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:58,510
I wish you would have aborted me.

103
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,110
We don't know why this happened.

104
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,040
All his life, he's been attracted to
the darker side of his personality.

105
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:10,370
He's--he's been this way since he was a small child.

106
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,560
We tried to go along for a while,

107
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:18,030
but carving the sign of the devil
into your forehead is going too far.

108
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,740
His darkness is destroying our family.

109
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:40,190
One set crystal tumblers with decanter.

110
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,400
Do you think this trim here is solid gold?

111
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,260
- I don't know.
- Of course it is, fool!

112
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,100
Get your grubby fingerprints off it.

113
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,370
What the hell's going on?

114
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,420
You have ignored all of my requests

115
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,440
for an itemized account of everything on this--

116
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,050
Don't you touch it!

117
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,150
So you board her illegally.

118
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,640
Not illegally, by court order.

119
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:00,170
Get that away from me.

120
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,340
Where can I find the keys to the stateroom?

121
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,270
50 feet that way, my friend.

122
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:09,870
Who are you?I don't even recognize you.

123
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:12,580
Look.I tried to be empathetic,
I've tried to be understanding and kind,

124
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,150
but you could give a shit.

125
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,770
Fine, you want to wallow in your misery,

126
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,470
you want to make me the bogeyman, that's fine, all right?

127
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,790
Just don't take my boat!

128
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,260
Oh, no.

129
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:23,300
I know how important this thing is to you.

130
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,840
It represents the beginning of your new life,

131
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,170
a new life that i was not invited to be part of.

132
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,640
You know, I don't even like boats.

133
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,210
So you know what?

134
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:36,940
I think I'm gonna burn it, like a giant funeral pyre

135
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,120
commemorating the death of our marriage.

136
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:42,640
But first, I'm gonna have all my lesbian friends come,

137
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,000
and we're gonna have a big bash,

138
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,980
and we're gonna wear our bikinis
and rub each other with coconut oil

139
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:50,240
and give this piece of shit the sendoff it deserves!

140
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,910
You think we could launch our jet skis from here?

141
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,580
Lizzie, you're all wet.

142
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,750
I'm sorry.That was way out of line.

143
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,030
I saw it.I saw him push your overboard.

144
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,170
I hope you have a hidden trust fund somewhere because--

145
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,610
This is none of your business, specs.

146
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,280
You've just lost your case, all right?

147
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,490
I am gonna go call mrs. Troy's lawyer.

148
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,460
You can consider me a witness.

149
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,950
Give me your hand.

150
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,240
I want to thank you.

151
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,870
I thank you because you know what, christian?

152
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,210
Now I'm getting it all.

153
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,460
I am getting the boat, I'm getting the car,

154
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:22,020
and I'm getting the house!Oh, my god!

155
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,570
And the only thing that you're ever gonna be left with

156
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,220
is a truckful of regret and your big dick.

157
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:30,920
Liz...

158
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,430
Jesus.

159
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,860
Big dick.

160
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,210
Stay still.

161
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:58,270
Are we done?

162
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,250
I have to pick my daughter up from day care.

163
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:03,550
We are all done, and you will never have to see me again,

164
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,070
for your moustache, anyways.

165
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,970
Of course, you might want to think about doing your bikini line.

166
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,050
- How often do you wax?
- Excuse me?

167
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,170
Orange face push too hard.

168
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,860
Nobody like the hard sell.

169
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:21,480
And those chicken legs...she need to eat some pork.

170
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,460
What's so funny, you two?

171
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:24,810
Nothing, kimmie.

172
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:27,360
We say you are a good businesswoman.

173
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:31,750
This is tea tree oil.I want you to use this twice a day.

174
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,990
Thanks.

175
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,590
Ok.

176
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,600
Mani-pedi?

177
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:48,010
No, I'm, uh, looking for--you have an electrolysis person?

178
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,540
Kimber henry?

179
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:54,320
What are you doing here?I'm booked.Go.

180
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,740
Look at you, huh?

181
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:59,380
From the first lady of porn to
frying follicles on ventura boulevard.

182
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,650
I mean, sweetie, you can't make that shit up.

183
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,760
This is my place of business, christian.
Why are you here?

184
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,480
Your place of business.This is bullshit.

185
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,540
You and I both know that. Right?

186
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,040
Tony Curtis must have broke her heart bad.

187
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,820
I have an offer you can't refuse.

188
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,290
Yeah? What's that?

189
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,150
I want to get into your business.

190
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:21,200
What, laser hair removal?

191
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,870
No. Don't be stupid. Skin flicks.

192
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,230
Oh, stop it.

193
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,170
What? I'm serious.

194
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:28,100
I mean, we could come up with a great concept, you know?

195
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,980
I mean, turn it into a series or something, right?

196
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,350
Seriously, come up with a--i don't know.

197
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,530
What about me banging you, you know,
and a bunch of other chicks...

198
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,110
with a bag on my head so nobody recognizes me.

199
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,000
I did that with a chick once, you know?

200
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,790
It was very interesting.

201
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,770
She was the one that wore the bag, but...

202
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,870
You know, I get 3 or 4 phone calls
a week begging me to make a comeback.

203
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,550
They say, "whatever you want, kimber."

204
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:57,380
So if vivid and vixen can't pull me back in, christian,

205
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:00,790
why in the world would you think you could?

206
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,960
Well, at least you know somebody still wants you.

207
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,580
Oh, and they do.

208
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:10,930
You know, uh, just this morning,

209
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:14,790
I was presented with this opportunity
to launch my own sex toy line.

210
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:17,750
So I'm still a goddess in this sordid business.

211
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:21,170
I just don't want to do it.

212
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,700
Sounds good. I'll do it.

213
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,360
Do what?

214
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,900
Make a mold of my dick.

215
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,470
- Oh, god.
- No, come on!

216
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,600
Think about it.Make a mold of little--little christian, you know.

217
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,320
We'll market it like "kimber henry's favorite love buddy."

218
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,790
Right?I mean, whatever.

219
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,500
I mean, you know, that's your thing.

220
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:40,990
You know?That's good, right?

221
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:43,260
Yeah. You're crazy.

222
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,950
I'm not crazy.

223
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,910
Don't tell me it's not the prettiest thing you ever saw.

224
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,780
Come on, perfect girth, perfect length.

225
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:56,320
We can make a shitload of money.

226
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,190
I don't know if you heard or not, but...

227
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,660
I'm going through a divorce right now, so...

228
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:10,490
Oh. Well, I'm--I'm really sorry to hear that.

229
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,960
Just think about it.

230
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:34,240
Poor orange face

231
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,240
Hey.

232
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,510
How come you didn't come over last night?

233
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,570
How come you didn't tell me that you have a death wish?

234
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,590
I don'T. Look.

235
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,090
I made a mistake.

236
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:40,180
I should have known better
than mixing sleeping pills with alcohol.

237
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:41,300
I'm sorry.

238
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,870
So am I.

239
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,280
What for?

240
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,180
There is no trust here.

241
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:52,090
And I cannot build a relationship
on a mountain of bullshit.

242
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:56,380
I think we should just take a giant step back,

243
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,580
put our engagement on hold.

244
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,100
Christian told me everything.

245
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,690
The fact that you think

246
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:03,990
that i can't handle your being broke, i mean--

247
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,720
I'm not broke.

248
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,570
No?

249
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,250
I just don't have the cash flow right now.

250
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,400
I guess I felt too embarrassed to tell you that.

251
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,050
You're gonna break off our engagement over this?

252
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:18,590
I wish you knew me better, sean.

253
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,590
Things mean nothing to me.

254
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,810
Honesty--that means everything.

255
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:56,250
Hey.I was just, uh, looking for a q-tip.

256
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,210
Give me my pills.

257
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:07,810
I didn't take your goddamn pills.

258
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,250
I said, give me my pills, all right?

259
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,760
I'm not gonna watch you sabotage your life like this.

260
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,330
It's enough I have to watch my son do it.

261
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,620
Give them to me.

262
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,850
Give them to me, or I will call the state

263
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:18,190
and have them revoke your license to prescribe.

264
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,600
I can't sleep.

265
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,090
Teddy just broke up with me.

266
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:28,770
Your inability to deal with your anxiety
started a long time before teddy.

267
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,470
You're dancing on the precipice of a big black hole, my friend,

268
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,390
whether you'd like to admit it or not.

269
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:39,030
I'll just see you go to rehab before I watch you fall in.

270
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,910
I find one more pill missing, i mean one,

271
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,770
from me or the office,
and I swear to you I will call the state board

272
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,200
and the dea and have you reported, you understand?

273
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,260
What the hell is she doing here?

274
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,660
I specifically requested teddy for all of my surgeries.

275
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,360
Tough titties, christian.

276
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:31,270
She asked if I could cover, and I said that I could.Sorry.

277
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:34,780
I heard you and teddy broke up, sean.

278
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,540
So am I.

279
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,100
Come on, let's get this over with.

280
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,760
"The only light is darkness."

281
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:48,660
This kid's a bowl of smiles, isn't he?

282
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,950
Looks like he just carved it.

283
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:53,890
15 blade, linda.

284
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,760
I get 50% of the profits, ok?

285
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,360
Fine.

286
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:18,400
If you're gonna drag me through the mud again,
I might as well get rich doing it.

287
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:22,280
And, uh, I need to start a college fund for jenna.

288
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,870
Fine. Just do it.

289
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:35,680
Rub a thick coating of this all over
your genitals and make yourself hard.

290
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,370
Can you give me a hand?

291
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,360
Christian, do it.

292
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,320
Gee.

293
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,100
Come on, baby, can you give me a hand here?

294
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:00,000
Not after what you've put me through.

295
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:03,250
Come on, give me--just--just

296
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,510
let me--let me touch those pretty babies.

297
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:09,010
Come on.Oh, that's good.

298
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,850
That's it.

299
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,560
Quick! Come on, hurry up.
Pour the mold before I lose my wood.

300
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,590
- Come on!
-  Ok.

301
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,430
- Lay back.
- Before I lose the woody!All right!

302
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:40,560
How long does this take to set?

303
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,840
20 minutes.

304
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,180
What? 20 minutes?

305
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,520
Just think of me.

306
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,940
Oh! No way, sweetie.

307
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,180
I'll probably be thinking about how much money I'll make.

308
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,100
The food sucks.

309
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,520
And they use dishwater for the coffee.

310
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,190
You're better off just eating the actual menu.

311
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,400
Trouble sleeping?

312
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:35,360
You see that guy?

313
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,670
Truck salesman.

314
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,010
He got laid off.

315
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:42,810
Had to cash in his 401(k).Now he's broke.

316
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,780
That one?

317
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,720
Failed her mcats 3 times, thinks she's never gonna be a doctor.

318
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,090
That poor bastard?

319
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:56,660
Lost his house in a fire, didn't have insurance.

320
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,500
Ok. What about you?What's your story?

321
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:07,060
Fiance dumped me...hard.

322
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,130
You?

323
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,490
Something similar and then some.

324
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,630
Vivien.

325
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,440
Sean.

326
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:18,790
You decided yet?

327
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,090
He's not hungry.

328
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,300
Vivien, you can't keep telling people about the food.

329
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,140
I need the tips.

330
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,150
Oh, god.

331
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,300
She's such a bitch.

332
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,600
Actually, I did want to eat.

333
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,860
Yeah, but I know what you're really hungry for.

334
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,660
Sleep.

335
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,430
Come with me, I'll show you where you can get some.

336
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:59,820
Careful there, buddy boy.

337
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,960
I don't think you realize how big it is.

338
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,970
Not even close, milton berle.

339
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,630
Just try and relax.

340
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,900
It's pulling my pubes.

341
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,710
Why'd you want a mold of his dick, anyway?

342
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,160
So you don't get lonely when he goes out of town?

343
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,630
I'm not dating kimber, all right, mike?

344
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,990
Kimber is the mother of my granddaughter.

345
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,520
I know that's hard to believe since I'm so good-looking,

346
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,460
but, anyway, she's got some money problems,

347
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,370
and I have this fantastic attribute, so I'm helping her out.

348
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,550
We're gonna make millions on this thing, right?

349
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,620
Actually, he's the one with the money problems.

350
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,870
He came to me here.

351
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,360
Thank you.

352
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:32,450
I have to tell you, I've always been a big fan of your work.

353
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:33,780
Oh, jesus.

354
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:36,040
Get this off my dick, would you?

355
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:38,290
All right.

356
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,260
All right.

357
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:48,130
Oh, thank god.

358
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,160
That's it?

359
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,660
So that's what the big fuss is about?

360
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,500
Like you've ever seen bigger?

361
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,980
I got to go.

362
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:01,390
Look.You're gonna want to soak it for a while, but you'll be fine.

363
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:02,240
Thanks, doc.

364
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,480
Hope to see you soon, kimber.

365
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,210
Nice seeing you, mike.

366
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,230
Oh, for christ's sakes, snap yourself out of it, would you?

367
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:15,390
As if mike would date an old leather shoe like you.

368
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,240
Whatever, christian.

369
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:21,620
So, uh, we'll do this again tomorrow night, right?

370
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,500
Yeah?I promise I'll shave better.

371
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:24,740
No.

372
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:26,140
No?What are you talking about?

373
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:28,500
Come on, we're gonna make a pile of money out of this thing.

374
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,860
We're a great team.Think of jenna.

375
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:37,280
Ok. So...tomorrow night at 9:00?

376
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:49,170
I find this place very relaxing.

377
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:53,410
You find it relaxing to be around human suffering?

378
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:56,330
We're all suffering, sean.

379
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:59,290
It's just that these people can't hide it.

380
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:05,650
Watching them bleed makes me feel less...alone.

381
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,700
What do you think happened to that guy?

382
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:17,230
Ah...spinal cord injury, probably from a car accident.

383
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:18,550
How do you know?

384
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:21,350
He has a compound fracture of his femur,

385
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,020
and he's not squirming in pain.

386
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:24,630
You a doctor or something?

387
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,270
Plastic surgeon.

388
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:28,430
- Nice.
- Yeah.

389
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,660
- Him?
- Um...

390
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,150
uh, broke his hand.

391
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:57,260
Um, pretty badly, from the looks of the swelling.

392
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:01,450
Tell me more.Tell me what...bones he's broken.

393
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,340
The--the metacarpals, the middle phalanges.

394
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,800
Possible that he punched someone.

395
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:11,610
It would not be uncommon for him to break the scaphoid as well.

396
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:14,170
Him?

397
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,680
He has lung cancer.

398
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,820
Stage 3.

399
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,260
I don't think he's gonna live through the night.

400
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:39,310
So this is what you do?

401
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:43,030
You get off in the E.R., And it puts you to sleep?

402
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:45,270
I come for the oxycontin.

403
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:49,410
Two of those little sweethearts, and I'm in snooze city.

404
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,650
- But now that I've met you...
- No. I can'T.

405
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,890
It's a schedule ii controlled substance.

406
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:59,140
If I abuse my power, I get my license stripped.

407
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,340
Bummer.

408
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,730
So you just fake being sick?

409
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,150
Yeah. I tried.

410
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:11,940
They see right through that.

411
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,780
So then how do you get them?

412
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,510
Like this.

413
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:21,850
Jesus!What are you doing?

414
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,540
Doctor man.

415
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:43,490
What are you still doing here?

416
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:46,130
You must really like me.

417
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,850
I want my cut.

418
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,960
Give me half the pills, or I'm gonna march in there

419
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,990
and tell them about your scam.

420
00:27:58,170 --> 00:27:59,370
You might sleep well tonight,

421
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:01,820
but good luck getting any more pills out of them.

422
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:11,460
I think I might have hit a nerve when I forked myself.

423
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:12,980
Yeah.

424
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:21,160
Yeah.You certainly frayed the muscle tissue,

425
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:24,520
and whoever stitched you up belongs in a butcher shop.

426
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:29,440
I assume you don't have any insurance.

427
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:36,160
Do your plastic surgeon thing, and the pills are all yours.

428
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,000
Deal.

429
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:25,410
So, are we ready to see some nice, clean skin?

430
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,410
Yeah.

431
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,900
Let's take a look.

432
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:34,200
Just gonna take the bandages off, ok?
It might be a little tender.

433
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,920
We've got our son back.

434
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,910
Would you like to see the results?

435
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,670
Yeah.

436
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,610
What do you think, enigma?

437
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:09,980
Ah...I--i feel a lightness.

438
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:14,200
I feel like death and hate aren't staring back at me

439
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:16,880
for the first time in a while.

440
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:20,700
I think enigma's dead.

441
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,500
My name's jared.

442
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:39,240
Do you really have to put me out?

443
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:42,610
Unless you enjoy excruciating pain,

444
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,300
in which case I'll happily leave you two alone.

445
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,870
Don't worry about teddy.

446
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,310
I'll be the one doing all the heavy lifting.

447
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:53,080
Just lay down and get comfortable.

448
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:56,230
So how'd you sleep last night?

449
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:58,500
Like a baby after a warm bottle.

450
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,490
Mmm. Me, too.

451
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,990
I'm glad you trusted me.

452
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:07,580
Please name as many U.S.Presidents as you can for me.

453
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,180
Bush.

454
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,100
Nixon.

455
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,460
Bush.

456
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,940
Dr. Mcnamara, she's all yours.

457
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,120
But then, I suppose you knew that already.

458
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:19,730
When we're done here, I want you to pack your things and go.

459
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:20,780
You're firing me?

460
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,940
It sucks getting dumped, doesn't it?

461
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,820
Except I'll be a gentleman about it,

462
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,270
give you two weeks' severance.

463
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:28,120
I'd rather get the ring i gave you back.

464
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,430
It's worth more.

465
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,940
It's in my office.

466
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:34,440
If you leave your key on my desk, you can have it back.

467
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,210
Teddy.

468
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,240
What are you doing in sean's office?

469
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:22,540
Um...just picking up the ring that I gave him.

470
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:24,720
Kind of a closure.

471
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,090
If only it were that easy, right?

472
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:29,970
The only possible closure i could have with christian

473
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,960
would land me in a maximum-security prison.

474
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:37,070
I just love him so much.

475
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:42,220
You know?I just...I do.

476
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,000
I'll be fine.

477
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:49,570
Um, please don't tell him you saw me like this, ok?

478
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:54,860
- I'd really rather he didn't know. -  No worries.

479
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,970
Ok, kimber henry.

480
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,580
My dick is in your hands.

481
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,410
Don't blow it.

482
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,890
At least she knows how.

483
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:26,150
You sad, sad girl.

484
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:27,070
Excuse me?

485
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:28,430
Talk about a sucker.

486
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,820
He dangles his dingle right in front of you,
and you're down on your knees.

487
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,170
What's this?

488
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:37,730
Oh, that's right--legal fees.

489
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:42,250
Give me back christian's cock.

490
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:46,010
Don't you dare.

491
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,210
You have not learned a thing.

492
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:53,310
You sound like the bitter,spiteful, jilted ex-wife you are.

493
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:57,170
You are such a loser, kimber.

494
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,340
You think you can make him change?

495
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:01,710
I have seen him treat you like shit.

496
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:04,860
He traded your ass in for a goddamn car.

497
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:07,610
What's it gonna take for you to realize
what you're dealing with?

498
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:11,200
You have no idea who he is, liz.You never have.

499
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:17,640
That's why you up there saying
those vows at an altar was a joke.

500
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,340
That's why I left.

501
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:22,680
You're a joke, kimber, and the reason you had to leave

502
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:24,920
was because you weren't standing up there.

503
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:27,880
And if you think cashing in on his cock

504
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,740
is gonna make that dream come true,

505
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,850
then you haven't learned anything in all these years,

506
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:37,490
and I think that that is so unbearably pathetic.

507
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:42,860
You think that you can wipe out his darkness with your love?

508
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:46,560
You can't, and you know why?

509
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,390
Because underneath that darkness,

510
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,320
there's nothing there.

511
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,400
I deserve better than that.

512
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:59,190
I don't know about you.

513
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:23,860
Why don't you just go ahead and kiss him?

514
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,460
I'm always looking for balance.

515
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,910
My pecs are lagging,
I just hit it harder in the gym next time.

516
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,350
Fascinating.

517
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,510
Damn, hate it when that happens.

518
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:43,540
The water is cold.

519
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,070
Hey, hey!

520
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:55,070
Hey, there's the guy I'm looking for.

521
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:57,440
- Check out these numbers. -  Ok.

522
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,910
The distributor put the kimber henry love rocket into 30 stores

523
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:04,000
in the los angeles/san francisco markets two days ago.

524
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:09,220
Well, they've already sold out,  5,000 units.

525
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:11,570
Whoa, all right, kimber.

526
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:13,340
- I'm so happy for you.
- Thanks.

527
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:15,010
What the hell you hugging him for?

528
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,570
It's my cock that's selling like hotcakes.

529
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:20,010
Well, actually, it's not, christian.It's mike'S.

530
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:21,840
What?

531
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,720
Well, I hope it's cool, christian.

532
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:28,390
You know, after I saw how magnificent his manhood was,

533
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:32,010
i knew he was the only man that could really make the splash

534
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,290
that I needed to launch my new product line.

535
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:37,320
Oh, I'm taking you to spago to celebrate.

536
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,890
- I'll see you.
- Bye.

537
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:44,370
You're a whore, kimber.

538
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,980
We had a deal, little bitch.

539
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:53,440
Like you wouldn't have sold me out for half a penny.

540
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:08,880
I can barely breathe, it's so hot in here.

541
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,240
Let me turn on the air conditioner.

542
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:12,890
Yeah.

543
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:20,290
Like that?

544
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,130
Yeah.

545
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,230
Come here.

546
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,400
Oh...the iceman wants to cometh again?

547
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:31,470
Yeah.Third time is the charm,

548
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:34,970
and if it isn't, what better way to pass the hours?

549
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:36,850
You're objectifying me, you know?

550
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,930
You're using me for a sleeping pill.

551
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:41,240
Well, you're doing a shitty job.

552
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:45,490
Hey, you got any more of that oxy left?

553
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,060
No. I chew them like pez.

554
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,120
We could get more.

555
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,860
Oh, that was crazy.

556
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:56,160
Yeah, yeah, but it worked, right?

557
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:58,100
Got us what we needed.

558
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,530
I suggest the thigh.It's fleshy, and it heals quick.

559
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,300
No.

560
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:08,480
It's your turn.Fair is fair.

561
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,120
This is not who we are.

562
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:13,870
Really? Who are we?

563
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:18,450
We're two people suffering from psychosis
due to an extended lack of sleep.

564
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,720
Whatever.At least I'm trying to do something about it.

565
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:24,290
Not this way.

566
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:28,800
Jesus.

567
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:33,190
I shouldn't be doing this.

568
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:36,650
I just broke up with someone.So did you.

569
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,950
If they gave out awards for craziest rebound, we would win, right?

570
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:47,420
That's what I am to you, just some rebound?

571
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,690
Stab yourself.

572
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,340
You owe it to me.

573
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,450
You know what?

574
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,680
I've had enough self-destruction for a lifetime.

575
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:02,290
No, no, no, no, no. Please.

576
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,530
I don't want to be in this alone.

577
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,000
Don't you get it?

578
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:06,570
You stay awake long enough,

579
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:10,120
you lose touch with reality.It's like we're hallucinating.

580
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:12,430
This is a hallucination?

581
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:24,170
I think I might be in love with you.

582
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,580
The doctor will be along shortly to stitch you up.

583
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:35,760
In the meantime, here's some medicine for the pain.

584
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:41,700
Dr. Beyman, telephone.

585
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,110
Blair, dr. Blair...

586
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:39,150
We have a breaking story in pasadena,

587
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,510
where police are removing the bodies from

588
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:44,930
what they are calling a double homicide and suicide.

589
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:48,290
Garth and amanda mccloud were found murdered in their home,

590
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,010
shot then mutilated by their own son,

591
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:53,350
who then turned the gun on himself.

592
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,750
Friends and family of the slain couple say their son,

593
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,720
jared mccloud, referred to himself as enigma.

594
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:03,370
Garth mccloud was a professor of biology at city college,

595
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,360
and his wife amanda was a criminal attorney known best

596
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:09,500
for her work in the rico cases of the early 1980s.

597
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:12,070
Neighbors says that over the past few years...

598
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:13,570
What do you want, lizzie?

599
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:15,480
The family had been struggling with jared's insistence...

600
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:17,530
You're watching the news, huh?

601
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:19,610
Yep. I'm watching the news.

602
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,220
They were good people.

603
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:22,990
They never gave up on their son.

604
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:27,070
He just couldn't face that he was just one of those people,

605
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:30,220
just bad to the bone.

606
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:32,040
Ok. That's enough.

607
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:39,290
Ok, so lay it on me.

608
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,340
I'm sure you got another piece of shit for me to eat.

609
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:44,610
When I look at that kid,

610
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,970
i see what it's like to live in your anger,

611
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:50,650
and I could feel it happening to me.

612
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,510
As devastated as I was when you dumped me,

613
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:57,280
it was nothing compared to the hell that I have been in.

614
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,150
I'm dropping the lawsuit.

615
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:06,280
That's it. Game over.

616
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:08,960
I just wanted you to know.

617
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,470
You're jerking me off, right?

618
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:14,520
Not anymore.

619
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:21,050
Are you doing the right thing, lizzie?

620
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,270
I know it's not easy.

621
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:26,090
Actually, it's easier than i imagined.

622
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:29,730
Hating you and living in that darkness

623
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:34,120
was taking up too much space in my head, and I wanted it out.

624
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:36,850
I missed you, you know?

625
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:37,970
Christian...

626
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:40,320
It's so weird thinking that you hated me.

627
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:42,690
You're not listening to me.

628
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:45,920
I've let my hatred go,

629
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:49,990
and i don't plan on thinking about you at all.

630
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,870
Great, I mean, as long as
we can just stay good friends, you know?

631
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,930
You know what? We can'T.
