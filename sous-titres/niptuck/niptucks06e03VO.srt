1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,370
Previously on nip/tuck...

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:04,740
Dr. Christian troy.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,200
Dr. Mike hamoui.

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,260
- Mcnamara/troy, right?
- You've heard of us, eh?

5
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:11,270
Christian?

6
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:14,200
Hey, I heard you guys were out here now, too.

7
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:18,030
I have to tell you I've always been
a big fan of your work.

8
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,520
Hope to see you soon, kimber.

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,760
Nice to meet you, mike.

10
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,070
For christ's sake,
snap yourself out of it, would you?

11
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,270
As if mike'd date an old leather shoe like you.

12
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,030
Whatever, christian.

13
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:30,940
Mime is so amazing, man.

14
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,670
It takes us behind our petty egos,

15
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:36,260
beyond language, and-- and unifies us.

16
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,420
Is this a joke?

17
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,960
We can rent your room, ok?

18
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,150
So you either kick in,
or you're out by the first.

19
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,530
Ok.

20
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,840
Here.

21
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:04,250
Sean mcnamara, will you marry me?

22
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,670
Yes, I will.

23
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,950
Do you have any idea
what kind of stress he's been under?

24
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:10,090
Do you?

25
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,220
That's why he's livin' the lifestyles
of the rich and famous with you

26
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:13,970
and tryin' to pay child support

27
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,130
and trying to keep the business from going under.

28
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,450
He's hangin' on by a thread.

29
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:18,820
What happened to the girl
that didn't give a shit

30
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,300
about all these conventional,
bourgeois trappings?

31
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,080
I think we should just take a giant step back.

32
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,810
What, you're gonna break off
our engagement over this?

33
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,470
I wish you knew me better, sean.

34
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,520
Things mean nothing to me.

35
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:38,490
Honesty, that means everything.

36
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,770
Tell us what you don't
like about yourself, briggitte,

37
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,320
because I'm having trouble finding any flaws.

38
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:50,400
Oh, you're so very sweet.

39
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,220
Where are your people from?

40
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,110
Uh, my mother's mexican,
and my father's from egypt.

41
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,180
- Oh.
- I was actually raised in cairo.

42
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,790
And not even a hint of an accent.

43
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,300
I disguise it well.

44
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,510
Get a couple heinekens in me,
and, oh, forget about it.

45
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,760
What is it you want done, mrs. Reinholt?

46
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,660
According to your file, you have, uh,

47
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:13,400
every plastic surgery procedure known
to man in very interesting locales--

48
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,190
venezuela, lisbon, singapore.

49
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,410
I travel.

50
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,890
Some people collect snow globes.

51
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,740
I like face-lifts.

52
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,070
But in the last 6 months,

53
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,010
the only thing I've had done was
a little lunchtime lipo in vegas.

54
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,220
I am not an addict.

55
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,890
And let me apologize
if dr. Troy implied that you were.

56
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,910
Excuse me?

57
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,860
Well, before you pucker up and
kiss my ass too much, pretty boy,

58
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,700
first you got to lipo out all the fat
in there from the last few months, eh?

59
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,060
Also, I want my, uh, neck tightened,

60
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,340
and then I think I want another
little, uh, brow lift.

61
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:51,180
But I must have my own man
in there to supervise the postop.

62
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,530
Ma'am, we provide state-of-the-art postop care.

63
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,840
There's really no need for an outside physician.

64
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,770
Yeah, but--but hans is not a doctor.

65
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,560
He's a leech farmer.

66
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,780
- Leeches?
- Oh, yes.

67
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:07,610
Dr. Mendoza used it down in
caracas after my last eye lift.

68
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,230
I swear it heals 3 times faster than usual.

69
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,810
- See, those leeches--
- I know what the leeches do.

70
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,090
Their saliva acts as an anticoagulant
and an anti-inflammatory.

71
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:20,450
Yes, and then you give yourself
a little tiny dose of heparin

72
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:24,760
and a couple of aspirin, and, mwah,
oh, they're little miracle workers.

73
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,730
They're a crock,
and I'm not gonna allow them in this office.

74
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,630
The last thing we need here is more parasites.

75
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,630
What are you so afraid of, christian?

76
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:37,510
You know what, boys?I think I'll have hans
come in and show you his babies.

77
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,430
And why would I agree to that?

78
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:43,430
Because, darling, I pay in cash.

79
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,620
Don't you ever talk to me like that again.

80
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,030
This is my office, pod boy.

81
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,070
You're right.

82
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,760
I'm sorry.

83
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,990
Look, I need to be honest with you.

84
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,210
I been hidin' these feelings,
and now I'm actin' out.

85
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,840
It's kimber.

86
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,710
She's still in love with you.

87
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:08,210
When I eat asparagus, my piss stinks.
Tell me something I don't know.

88
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,640
I'm in love with her.

89
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:10,990
What?

90
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,310
You're seeing kimber?

91
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,330
Oh, it's been the most amazing 6 weeks of my life.

92
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,950
I've been with thousands of chicks,

93
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:22,550
but there's somethin' about kimber
that just hooks me.She's so open, you know?

94
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,240
Ohh.First couple weeks--heh.

95
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,280
We were doin' it 3 times a day, all over town,

96
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,360
and oof. All of sudden, ffft.Nothin'.

97
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,250
Total lockdown.

98
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,050
Maybe you just don't turn her on any more.

99
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,030
Hate to say it, but, uh--

100
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,060
fact is I didn't wanna have to, but

101
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,680
looks like you got a little
more junk in the trunk, my friend.

102
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,640
Well, I been eatin' a lot more, you know.

103
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:49,930
Yeah.

104
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,520
Stress.

105
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,110
The last time we did it, she even started crying.

106
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,520
She ever do that with you?

107
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,420
What, you think this is because
she's in love with me?

108
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,230
She talks about you.

109
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,220
- A lot.
- Yeah?What's she say?

110
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:04,690
Nothing good.

111
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:07,360
But it's more about the quantity than quality.

112
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:10,070
She can't disguise how she's really feelin'.

113
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,550
Tell you what I'll do.

114
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,820
I'll get to the bottom of what's going on.

115
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,620
Kimber's never been able to lie to me.

116
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,700
- Really?
- Yeah.

117
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,410
Y-you'd do that for me?

118
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,540
Pssh.You get yourself back into shape,

119
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,290
and I'll make sure that kimber's
all lubed up and ready to go.

120
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:28,940
Ho ho.Thank*, man.You're the best.

Ok, come on.We're at work.

125
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,690
Oh, it's not like anyone can do anything now.

126
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,100
You don't want 'em to find out that way, do you?

127
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,430
Guess I do wanna see the looks on their faces.

128
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,960
Could I get everyone's attention for a second, please?

129
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,760
Teddy and i have an announcement to make.

130
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,300
We eloped 2 days ago.

131
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:45,550
Surprise.

132
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,780
You got married?

133
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:54,170
- Yep, and we have the hardware to prove it.
- Yes, we do.

134
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,180
Is this a joke?

135
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,380
Why would it be a joke?

136
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,230
You dumped her and fired her a few days ago.

137
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,110
We couldn't stand being apart,

138
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,200
so we decided to have one of those
"let's try and be friends" dinners.

139
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,050
- And one thing led to another.
- Yep.

140
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:11,900
Anyway, we figured the best way to
get through these stormy patches was

141
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:15,890
- to drop anchor and just make a firm commitment.
- Go down with the ship.

142
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,740
What I think he meant to say was congratulations.

143
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:23,330
We're very happy for you,
and we are just a little bit surprised.

144
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,380
So what are you two doin' here?

145
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,070
You should be on your honeymoon.

146
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,610
Well, annie comes in this week,

147
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,600
so I thought it'd be better
if she met teddy right away,

148
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,610
not postpone anything, you know?

149
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,280
You're not gonna congratulate us?

150
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,070
Of course.Congratulations.

151
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,190
Hans!Sorry.I'm a little distracted.

152
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,210
We're right in the middle of a lesson here.

153
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,060
What's this?

154
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:48,330
This is ms. Reinholt's argentinean genius,

155
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:51,460
who's gonna teach us
how these little suckers work.

156
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:58,010
Hans, this is my newly married partner, sean mcnamarA.

157
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,140
Congratulations.

158
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,510
Could you put one of those on
christian, maybe around his mouth?

159
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,030
Oh, just like the old liz,
the one I didn't marry.

160
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:06,900
So, as I was saying, hirudotherapy,

161
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:11,230
or using leeches for medicinal purposes,
has been around for thousands of years.

162
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,250
Why?

163
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,540
Well, they have a natural anticoagulant they secrete.

164
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,680
It's great for postsurgical use, because

165
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,280
they restore the blood flow around the sutures.

166
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,520
Yeah, well, I'm still not touchin' 'em.

167
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,380
How much blood can they drink?

168
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,060
Up to 5 times their weight.

169
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,220
Now, they do run a high risk of infection, don't they?

170
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,210
No more than any other recovery method,

171
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,070
and they work much faster than manmade drugs.

172
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,680
And mrs. Reinholt has used them before,

173
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:40,310
and she gave us a deposit,
so if she wants leeches, she gets leeches.

174
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:43,500
Uh, it's feeding time for my little friends.

175
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,890
I put their food in your fridge, so, uh, excuse me.

176
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,920
You know, mrs. Mcnamara,

177
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,570
I wanna hear every single detail about that wedding.

178
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,370
Let's go, linda.

179
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,040
I get it.

180
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,370
You're pissed I didn't tell you.

181
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,100
Still doesn't excuse the attitude.

182
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,320
Actually I'm not pissed at all.

183
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,880
I've had my fair share of weddings this year,

184
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,470
and I'm fine with it.

185
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,560
Well, then what?Just spit it out.

186
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,860
You don't like her?I don't care.

187
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,470
I just hope you didn't put any of your stuff in her name.

188
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,150
Teddy's not liz, christian, and I'm not you.

189
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,790
And as far as signing my life over,

190
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:25,170
she's the one who insisted I sign
a prenup before we got married.

191
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,920
That's right.

192
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,830
Maybe it's better you weren't there.

193
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:32,240
"Make sure she can't touch your money"
would have been a lousy toast.

194
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,040
- Fancy meeting you here.
- Jesus, christian.

195
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,490
You scared me.

196
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:46,570
What are you doing here?

197
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,500
Last I heard, this is a public beach.

198
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,750
Leave me alone.

199
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,750
I got a vested interest, sweetie pie.

200
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,690
You're bangin' one of my staff.

201
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,900
How's that goin', by the way?

202
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,520
I hear there's a little trouble in paradise.

203
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,220
Why won't you sleep with him, huh?

204
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,530
'Cause he's a knockoff of the real thing?

205
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:06,100
He is a sunny, upbeat person, and you aren'T.

206
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,040
What's the matter then?

207
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,200
He can't keep his cum in his cock
long enough for you to get off?

208
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,580
NO.

209
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,830
In fact, he has a few moves that would make you blush.

210
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:17,800
The problem is is that he's perfect.

211
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,090
And just when I'm ready to let go,

212
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:23,550
I think of you, and then a little
voice pops in my head saying,

213
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,630
"is he gonna ask you to pee on him,
or is he gonna put you in handcuffs,

214
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,810
or is he gonna hand you a dildo?

215
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,410
" And I'm tired of it.I want a connection,

216
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,480
like a real emotional connection.

217
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:37,490
And every man turns into a complete asshole

218
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,580
the minute you open up to him, so I keep him sweet,

219
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,420
I keep him vulnerable by not putting out so much.

220
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,580
Well, you know what they say.
There's no prude like an old whore.

221
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,930
What the hell is that?

222
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:56,930
Well, we got drunk on our second date
and exchanged tattoos.

223
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,870
He has me on his shoulder.

224
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,560
It's cute, huh?

225
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,250
You 2 mental midgets belong together.

226
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,590
You know, if I didn't know better,

227
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,750
I'd think you were jealous.

228
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,210
Honey, eat.

229
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,870
You love pasta.

230
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,210
You're a pasta-tarian.

231
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:30,100
You used to beg me to take you to a place
like this when we were in florida.

232
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,980
Can you turn off your ipod, please?

233
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:42,160
I said take off your ipod, please.

234
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:43,830
Stop it.You'll break 'em.

235
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,920
- And take off that hat.
- I don't want to.

236
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:49,770
Annie, your mom told me
you were havin' a tough time

237
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:53,590
adjusting to the divorce and all the changes,
and I want you to know

238
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:57,590
I get it, and I'm here for you.

239
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:58,660
We both are.

240
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,870
You're the one who married her, not me.

241
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,910
All right, you know what?
I don't care how much you're going through.

242
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,460
I didn't raise you to be rude.

243
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,740
It's fine, sean.Just leave it.

244
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,410
Ok.Great.

245
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,650
- Let's just eat.
- I'm not hungry.

246
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,300
My stomach hurts.

247
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,360
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

248
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,930
Unless you think that would be rude.

249
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,580
I'm sorry.

250
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,100
It's like I don't even recognize her.

251
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,450
I don't know who that is.

252
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,620
That is a 13-year-old girl, honey.

253
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:33,150
We're all horrifically hormonal at that age.
It's totally normal.

254
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,260
And what's with the makeup and the hat?

255
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,430
Well, I guess she's just, you know,

256
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:41,970
experimenting for the first time, trying on different personas,

257
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,030
disguises, seeing what image fits her.

258
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:48,230
Well, they're gonna have to fit me with a straitjacket.

259
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,250
I tell you, compared to her, matt was a breeze.

260
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:55,730
Well, I am sorry, but I have to leave you, too.

261
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,220
Oh.Right.Run away.

262
00:12:58,370 --> 00:12:59,280
Coward.

263
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,890
Lawyer appointment actually.

264
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,240
If something happens to me,

265
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,240
I want everything to go to my new husband.

266
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,570
- Good luck.
- Yeah.I'm gonna need it.

267
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:18,140
Are you swedish?Is that it?
Is that what-- Yeah.You are?

268
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,930
Yeah.What's your last name?

269
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,520
Klein.Well, have you had any surgeries done yet?

270
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,970
Which ones?

271
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,960
Good afternoon, mrs. Reinholt.

272
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,620
I'm dr. Mcnamara.

273
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,130
I'll be doing your operation.

274
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,150
Oh, I don't care who does my surgery, darling.

275
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,940
Just tell me, did my leeches make it here all right?

276
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:41,790
Ah, the little suckers are
sliming away happily in the next room,

277
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,090
awaiting marching orders.

278
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:46,700
Ah, good, good, good, 'cause
I have a very big charity event this weekend,

279
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,890
and the only way I can make sure
that I recover in time is

280
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,300
if I have the hirudotherapy and then
a little bit of the soupcon of the heparin on the side.

281
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:58,260
Now, heparin is contraindicative with leeches,

282
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,010
because they produce their own anticoagulant.

283
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,720
You can't rush recovery, mrs. Reinholt.

284
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:05,130
Oh, but I always do, doctor.I always do.

285
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,940
Ok.Shall we get started?

286
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:09,050
Let's put this show on the road.

287
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,770
Linda, hit it.

288
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,060
Dixie?

289
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:25,210
Dixie, is that you?

290
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:28,750
Oh, you look fantastic as a brunette.

291
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,920
No, I'm teddy, teddy rowe.

292
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:33,440
Oh, come on.I never forget a pretty face.

293
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:37,310
Oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry about
what happened with harland.

294
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,360
Oh, you poor baby.Oh, you poor child.

295
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,260
What is she talking about?

296
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:52,380
I don't know.She must have thought I was someone else.

297
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:22,180
Hey there, stranger.

298
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,510
You must be pretty hungry.
I saved some food for you if you-

299
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,940
I told you my tummy hurts.

300
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,440
Well, if you get hungry in the middle of the night,
it's in the fridge,

301
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,350
and you can just help yourself, ok?

302
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:44,990
No, don'T.I like to wear it.
It helps me fall asleep.

303
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,340
Annie, you have to take it off.

304
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,470
It's not healthy to keep a hat on all the time.

305
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,140
You gotta give your scalp a chance to breathe.

306
00:15:55,510 --> 00:16:00,140
Hey, when was the last time you washed your hair, huh?

307
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:02,330
Want all the boys to run in the opposite direction

308
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,960
and say you have stinky hair?

309
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:09,540
Sweetie, I'm not foolin' around.

310
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:10,880
- I just wanna--
- Dad, no.

311
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,080
- I just want you to take-- - Dad!

312
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:14,400
I want it off.

313
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,210
What the hell is this?

314
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:20,030
How did this happen?

315
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:22,340
Annie, how did this happen?

316
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:26,790
I get nervous sometimes.I just--I just pull it out.That's all.

317
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:31,800
Does your mother know about this?

318
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,830
No, and if you tell her, I'll never speak to you again.

319
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,530
Did you know that hippocrates used leeches?

320
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,310
So did ancient indian doctors and the egyptians.

321
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,380
They also prayed to the hippo gods in hope
that springtime would come.

322
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,560
What's in the box?

323
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,250
Wedding presents.

324
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,550
Are all these for me?

325
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,510
Oh, no, no, no.You get to pick one.

326
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:41,270
Well..."to liz and christian,
get toasted, love nurse linda.

327
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,850
" I'm guessin' that's the toaster oven.

328
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,150
Are you regifting your wedding presents?

329
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:48,970
Try the big box.It could be an ice-cream maker.

330
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,420
Thanks.

331
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,220
It's just what I wanted.

332
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,810
Mike was looking for you.

333
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,310
Mike.

334
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,150
You know he's dating kimber?

335
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,220
What a skank.

336
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,330
What do you care?

337
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,000
Welt's--I don't care.

338
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,880
She's a whore, has absolutely no moral values.

339
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,570
Sound like anyone else you know?

340
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:10,950
Come on.

341
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,880
You and kimber were made for each other.We all know it.

342
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:17,200
You're both superficial, addicted to sex.

343
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,500
Both of you were abused as children.

344
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,380
Bullshit.I can do better than her.

345
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,970
For a night, maybe.

346
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:27,040
Kimber is the only woman
who would actually stay with you.

347
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:30,720
You are the male and female version of the same person.

348
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:35,160
Frankly, I'm surprised it's taken you
this long to figure that out.

349
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,760
Come on.We have a consult.

350
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:45,540
"Frankly, I'm surprised it's taken you
that long to figure that out.

351
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:48,340
" Ok.

352
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,530
Tell us what you don't like about yourself, mr. O'brien.

353
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:54,310
Uh, call me steve.

354
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,900
I'm not a pretty woman.

355
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:01,890
Well, steve, men are doing cosmetic surgeries

356
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:04,210
in almost equal measure with women.

357
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,280
What I mean is an attractive female face
would be slightly heart-shaped.

358
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:10,340
Her profile would be fairly flat,

359
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:12,990
her features more delicate in appearance.

360
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,420
I mean, if you look at my profile, it slopes backwards.

361
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,780
You a transsexual?

362
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,560
A transvestite.

363
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,130
A fully functioning heterosexual male

364
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:24,730
who occasionally likes being a woman.

365
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:27,100
My feminine name is modesty.

366
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,850
I'm not gay, and most transvestites aren'T.

367
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:34,800
We just have certain characteristics
inside of us that society labels feminine.

368
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:37,820
Cross-dressing provides me the opportunity to explore

369
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:41,780
certain things that I suppressed as a kid.

370
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,140
I see that you're married.

371
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,150
Oh.Yeah.17 years.

372
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,730
3 great kids.

373
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,330
My wife said she married me
'cause I was like a great girlfriend.

374
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,670
With a fully functioning penis.

375
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:56,790
You know, looking at you,
I'm not sure a brow reduction

376
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:59,910
or a chin reduction would create
a more feminine profile.

377
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,310
I think it would just compromise
what you already have.

378
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,620
That's my point, doc.

379
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,910
Uh, i wanna stay a good-looking man.

380
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,430
I just wanna broaden my options as a woman.

381
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,470
Th-that's why I'm here.

382
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:15,270
I want you to create a mask that
I could actually wear in public.

383
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,790
But why?

384
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:20,100
Your wife likes you the way you are.

385
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,110
I don't know if you guys are married,

386
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,310
but my wife likes going out,

387
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:29,070
and unless we stick to gay restaurants
or visits to buckles and boas,

388
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,830
we run the risk of running into
somebody from the office or,

389
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:34,820
god forbid, the tennis club.
I mean, those guys are mostly lawyers.

390
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:38,480
They live inside the box.
They wouldn't understand modesty.

391
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:40,080
What's, uh, buckles and boas?

392
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,730
Uh, it's a boutique that caters to transvestites.

393
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:45,620
They make female underwear that takes care of our needs.

394
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,000
Uh, just have a look at my specs.

395
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,250
You know, I'm sure you can improve on what I've done.

396
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:53,110
Uh, we do plastic surgery, not special effects.

397
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,920
You do faces.

398
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:57,820
Guys, I'm just askin' you to dress me up for the ball

399
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:01,620
so I can turn back into plain old steve
at the stroke of midnight.

400
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:05,550
I'm willing to pay top dollar.

401
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:11,570
The, um, buckles and boas, that,
uh, in west hollywood?

402
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:12,920
Uh, yeah.

403
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:14,530
Cool.

404
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,880
Research...

405
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,730
stuff.

406
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,990
Oh, there you are.

407
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,740
So, did you talk to kimber yet?

408
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:31,410
Bad news, kemosabe.

409
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:33,830
It's over, isn't it?

410
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,380
Shit.

411
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:37,180
I was thinkin' she was the one, you know?

412
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,500
She still could be.

413
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,590
You just have to show her that
you're willing to go the distance, my friend.

414
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,700
What do you mean?

415
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:43,940
Well, kimber's a porn star.

416
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,030
She's done it every which way and then some, right?

417
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:50,240
Oral, anal, double penetration, triple team--everything.

418
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,710
You think she cares about some regular joe cock guy?

419
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,140
Jeez, christian, what'd you do
when you two were together?

420
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:58,830
Well, you know, I was bangin' her
before her pussy became a revolving door,

421
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:04,160
but there's one thing that got her off,
when I dressed up like a woman.

422
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:07,410
That shit, she loves it, the kinkier, the better.

423
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,810
You're crazy.No way.I can't do that.

424
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:15,430
Come on.If you love her,
that's the only way you can prove how.

425
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,720
Wh--I wouldn't even know where to start.

426
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,140
I mean, what am I supposed to do,

427
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:21,030
just walk into a bloomingdale's and ask for a-

428
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,430
heels and dress in my size?

429
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:29,200
Better yet, go to a place that caters to your needs.

430
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,310
You really suck.You know that?

431
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,050
I was just tryin' to make you laugh,

432
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,820
you know, enjoy life a little bit.

433
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:18,310
Just go.I don't feel good.

434
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:31,220
Fine.Stay in your little box of brattiness.

435
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:45,670
I tried, man.She's bein' a complete bitch.

436
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:47,370
Don't call your sister a bitch.

437
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,390
She's obviously goin' through a very hard time.

438
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,890
As long as she knows you care,

439
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:55,280
maybe just try to respect her space a little.

440
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:59,790
Yeah, well, she can have all the space she wants.

441
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,780
All right, I'm outta here.

442
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,940
Wait a minute.I'm makin' lunch for everyone.

443
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:07,070
Uh, I'm not hungry.

444
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:10,590
Matt, we haven't all been together
as a family in a long time.

445
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:15,300
I think this is what she needs.
I think we all need it.I need it.

446
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:18,790
Please?Just try.

447
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,880
- Fine.Ok.
- Thank you.

448
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:29,230
Annie, lunch is ready.

449
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,570
Dad!

450
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,540
Dad, please!

451
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:37,400
Ow!It hurts!

452
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,980
Daddy, my stomach!

453
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,160
It hurts so much.

454
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:44,380
All right.Let me see.Let me see.

455
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,970
Sh-she was fine a minute ago.

456
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,700
What, do you think it could be her appendix?

457
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:50,350
I don't think she has an infection.

458
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,500
Honey, did you eat something that I don't know about?

459
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,660
All right, get my car keys.

460
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:56,750
We gotta take her to the hospital.

461
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,010
Come on, sweetie.

462
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:06,020
What about the pain?Should we do a biopsy?

463
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:09,040
I don't think a biopsy will be necessary.

464
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:12,670
Your daughter has something called trichobezoar,

465
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:15,710
or the more colloquial rapunzel syndrome.

466
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:19,140
It's an intestinal condition, extremely rare,

467
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,080
resulting from the consumption of hair.

468
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,460
What?

469
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:26,150
It's usually triggered by trichotillomania,

470
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:29,520
a nervous disorder in which one pulls out one's own hair.

471
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:33,030
You can see the mass that's collected here
in the gastrointestinal tract,

472
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:35,230
which is what's causing the stomach pain.

473
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,870
Well, is there a purgative to give her to induce--

474
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:42,530
I'm afraid with a hairball this size,

475
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:45,620
surgery will be necessary to remove it.

476
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:49,060
Endoscopic retrieval.

477
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:54,300
With your consent, we can have
her scheduled for tomorrow evening.

478
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:57,270
No, that won't be necessary, thank you.

479
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:52,410
It's my fault.

480
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,670
I just, uh-- I left her.

481
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,820
I figured she'd be able to process the divorce,

482
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:02,040
like half the kids she knows had.

483
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:05,590
And suddenly she's got a new mom,
and she's never met her.

484
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:12,170
Sean, you're doing the best you can,
and nobody's perfect.

485
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,740
Have you called julia?

486
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,560
Well, I downplayed what's goin' on with annie.

487
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,040
Julia's been very fragile lately.

488
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,070
Didn't wanna upset her.

489
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,070
She's comin' out next week.

490
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:30,910
I should have known better.

491
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:33,470
Even though she doesn't live with me,

492
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:36,360
she still needs my protection.

493
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,870
Would you get in here?

494
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:53,180
Stop acting so suspicious.

495
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:55,060
You're just drawing attention to yourself.

496
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,770
- All right?Just relax.
- All right.

497
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,230
Just take a breath.

498
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:01,400
Just be yourself.I mean, that's what this place is all about.

499
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:03,980
Look at that.Oh, my god.This place is fantastic.

500
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:05,730
Ahh, I don't know if I can
go through with this, christian.

501
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,480
Aw, you love her, right?Huh?

502
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:11,940
You wanna satisfy her, so this is what works, ok?

503
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:15,390
W-well, then you're gonna
have to help me then, all right?

504
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,800
'Cause you know her best.

505
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,900
Hey, sweetheart.

506
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:24,230
You, uh, got a bag we can use while we're shopping?

507
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:27,920
Just, uh, let me know if you need a room.

508
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,530
Thanks.

509
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,430
Follow me.

510
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:37,570
Mike, how's it goin' in there?

511
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,000
Ok, I guess.

512
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,020
See the lakers last night?

513
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:43,600
Are you kidding?

514
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,340
I used to play in college.

515
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,370
Seriously?

516
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,380
Oh, yeah.

517
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:48,450
Think they'll go the whole way?

518
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:49,680
Oh, definitely.

519
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,730
I mean, we can run the floor, post up.

520
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:54,260
And they got that deep bench.

521
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:58,280
- It's on
- Hey, christian, you wanna come in and see?

522
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:00,300
Oh, just come out.What's the big deal?

523
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,890
Well, I don't know if I'm too
comfortable with that right now.

524
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,870
You know, if you can't do it here, then, you know,

525
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,060
how are you gonna be able to do it later?

526
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,280
Just step out and show us
what you're workin' with.

527
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:10,240
Remember, I'm here to help you.

528
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,310
Ok.

529
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,560
What do you think?

530
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:31,140
I think she'll love it.

531
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,710
Oh, yeah.

532
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:47,360
Just give me more and more and
more of my little friends, ok, hans.

533
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:49,500
I got a packed social schedule.

534
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,630
I really need for the swelling to be down by saturday.

535
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,060
Ohh.I'm gonna hurl.

536
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:56,810
Hey, where's dixie?

537
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,950
I'm sorry?

538
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,030
Dixie, my little, uh, friend from las vegas.

539
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:03,480
Oh, she was so helpful with that, uh,

540
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,840
business with the morphine drip.Ooh.

541
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,900
I could use a little more morphine right now, huh?

542
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,340
You mean teddy?

543
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:14,010
Her name is dixie, goddamn it.

544
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:17,190
Why does everybody keep talking to me like I'm senile?

545
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:20,060
Oh, come on, hans.Give me some more leeches.

546
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:24,620
Every little suck makes me feel
one step closer to perfection, darling.

547
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,500
I'm just gonna put one more.

548
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,890
No, sweetie, more than one.Come on.

549
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:31,410
No, more than one.

550
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:33,200
I'm telling you, more than one.

551
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,900
You already have 4.

552
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,680
Oh, for goodness sake.

553
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:54,610
Nurse, could I please have some water?My throat.

554
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:57,580
I can't move my hands.

555
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:01,030
What's--what's going on here, huh?

556
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:04,530
I need you to stay still, mrs. Reinholt,

557
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:07,930
- until these suckers do their work.
- Oh, my god.

558
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,480
No, no.No, no, no, no, no, no.

559
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,030
What is this?!

560
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:13,750
- Oh, god.
- Now, now.

561
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,120
Why are you doing this?

562
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:17,330
Stay calm.

563
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,160
Somebody, help!

564
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:21,430
Please-- I'm gonna have to help you relax.

565
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,890
Oh, god.

566
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:26,110
Hello!

567
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,170
Hello!Stop!

568
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:33,100
No, no, no, no.

569
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:41,970
Beauty sleep.

570
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:45,610
Your little suckers are so beautiful.

571
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,990
You're bleeding out.

572
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:50,330
I'm so sorry.

573
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,850
We're all out of band-aids.

574
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,630
'Cause of death-- exsanguination

575
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:30,570
due to misapplication of medicinal leeches.

576
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,390
I don't remember there being so many.

577
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:34,520
I only put 6 leeches.

578
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,740
She must have a-added some herself to-

579
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:38,630
-to speed up the recovery process.

580
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:41,100
Woman was painphobic.She was mad as a hatter.

581
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,730
Y-you don't understand.They're totally engorged.

582
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,460
They're supposed to fall off once they're full.

583
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:49,010
I want a full toxicology report.

584
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,760
Heparin?

585
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:58,530
You guys didn't give her blood thinner, did you?

586
00:34:58,650 --> 00:34:59,240
Of course not.

587
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,160
No wonder the leeches kept feeding.

588
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,050
She must have self-administered.

589
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,940
She mentioned using heparin in venezuela.

590
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,790
She could have used that to inject it into her I.V.

591
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:10,580
I mean, no disrespect to the dead,
but, uh, she was bat-shit.

592
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:15,670
Things people do to be beautiful.

593
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,160
Hey, close the doors, dude.

594
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,120
You were totally right.

595
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,310
Kimber went crazy.

596
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:31,840
She liked the kinky tranny look?

597
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,280
Totally.

598
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:37,100
Ok.So what'd you wanna show me?

599
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,120
She liked it?

600
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,490
You like it?

601
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:53,650
I--I wanted you to, you know, see that

602
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,790
I was in touch with my feminine side.

603
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,200
Of course I like it.

604
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:04,080
I love it.

605
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,080
I don't believe you.

606
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,730
I'm tellin' you, I got the blow job
of my life last night.

607
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,780
Oh, I owe you so much, man.Thank you.

608
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,810
I never would have done it
if it weren't for you.

609
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,540
What's this?

610
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:28,130
Oh, I went crazy and ordered a whole
bunch more stuff at crossdresser.Com--

611
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:33,080
bras, corsets, panties, uh, strap-on latex boobs.

612
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,860
You're really committed to this, mike.

613
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:37,730
Hey, kimber's into it, I'm into it, right?

614
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:43,180
So, um, did she tell you how good
I looked when I'm dressed up,

615
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,270
you know, like a chick?

616
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:53,830
Christian never did this for you, did he,

617
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:56,720
dress up like a ladyboy to excite you?

618
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:59,970
No.Never.

619
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:03,890
I mean, that idea would never have raced through

620
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,210
that self-centered little brain of his.

621
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:12,410
He would never risk making a fool
out of himself to make me happy.

622
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,140
Nope.

623
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:18,030
We were so busy gettin' busy,
we never even talked about you, bro.

624
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,820
Your consult's waiting for you in the lobby, mike.

625
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:23,600
Thank you, linda.

626
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:27,580
Hey, go ahead and check out all the stuff.

627
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,220
Just don't take it home,

628
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:33,610
'cause I'm planning on wearing all of it tonight.

629
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:59,910
I thought you were supposed to
get your blood drawn before we got married.

630
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,540
What's all this?

631
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:04,980
Well, all your talk about wills
and insurance inspired me.

632
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:08,040
I am doubling my life insurance policy.

633
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:12,960
Are you planning on, uh,
dying anytime soon, dr. Mcnamara?

634
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:16,280
No, but I'm not gonna live forever.

635
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,890
Our slump at work is going to end,

636
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,110
but what if something happens to me
during the next one?

637
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:25,480
I have worked too hard to
leave my family with nothing.

638
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:44,200
Listen, I hope you understand.

639
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:48,250
Uh, I'm making conor and annie sole beneficiaries.

640
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:50,080
What about matt?

641
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:52,510
I gave him a large sum of money

642
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:54,320
from the sale of the florida house,

643
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:59,450
and he spent it on scientology, his porn star wife,

644
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:02,260
and methamphetamines.

645
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:04,770
So no fatted calf for the prodigal son.

646
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,680
Not unless he kills it himself.

647
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,100
How 'bout a drink?

648
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:13,910
Uh, just a few more signatures, dr. Mcnamara.

649
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:19,620
I'll get it.

650
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,640
It's perfect.

651
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,650
I'm so happy for you, honey.

652
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,750
I'm so happy for us,

653
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:56,000
for the freedom this gives us
to live out our fantasies.

654
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,990
Look at me.

655
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:01,900
I'm pretty like a vain schoolgirl.

656
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:03,990
We better hurry.

657
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:06,770
Our dinner reservation's in half an hour.

658
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:09,530
What do you think, dr. Cruz?

659
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:11,420
Is my shadow balanced?

660
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:13,990
You're askin' the wrong person.

661
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:17,890
Hey, I've got an idea.

662
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:22,520
What if annie stayed with us for a couple of months?

663
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:24,310
You know, with all the trouble she's been having,

664
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:28,200
it might be nice to, uh, give her some time with her dad.

665
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:30,520
She's on a break from school, right?

666
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,340
Heck, conor can come out, too.

667
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,060
Really?

668
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:38,950
You wouldn't mind havin' a couple
of rug rats runnin' around?

669
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:44,430
Sean, those kids are my new family.I'm their stepmom.

670
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,760
This'd be a great way to get to know each other,

671
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,810
and I can make my new husband happy.

672
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:52,560
Well, it might put a crimp in our honeymoon period.

673
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,690
Annie is not well enough to fly yet.

674
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:57,980
She needs time to recover,
you know, get her strength back up.

675
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:01,170
Julia can always come out later if she wants.

676
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,980
I'm completely comfortable with that.

677
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:06,570
I love you.

678
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,330
Uh, dr. Mcnamara.

679
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,960
A few more.
