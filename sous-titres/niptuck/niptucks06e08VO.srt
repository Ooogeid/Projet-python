1
00:00:00,233 --> 00:00:01,841
I like my ring, and it came...

2
00:00:01,846 --> 00:00:04,099
from Mike's heart which
is really good...

3
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:06,421
And I don't think
you really have one.

4
00:00:06,426 --> 00:00:07,235
I do have one.

5
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,240
And...and it belongs to you....

6
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:12,421
Mike, I just need
you to back up...

7
00:00:12,426 --> 00:00:14,703
All the way to... taking
my ring back?

8
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:17,482
I love you, Mrs. McNamara.

9
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:21,855
The key for s'mores is getting
the perfect proportion...

10
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:23,685
between the chocolate bar to a...

11
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,487
...graham cracker....

12
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:27,492
- Look at that.
- Nice.

13
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:29,824
You marry a woman
you don't even know,

14
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:31,659
who tries to kill you.

15
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:33,664
I don't need a lecture.

16
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:56,479
Well, tell us what you don't
like about yourself, Mrs. Pierce.

17
00:00:57,023 --> 00:01:00,160
Well, I guess the fact
that I'm not perfect.

18
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,599
Well, who is?

19
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:04,655
Barbie.

20
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:08,032
Is Barbie a friend of yours?

21
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:12,549
Well, I've worshiped her since
I was a little girl....

22
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,679
- You mean the doll.
- Uh, she's more than a doll.

23
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:17,759
Barbie and Ken are the
synthetic embodiment...

24
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:19,389
of the ideal post-modern couple.

25
00:01:19,509 --> 00:01:21,592
Not to mention they've
been together for 50 years,

26
00:01:21,712 --> 00:01:24,297
never aging,
just changing outfits.

27
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,566
Of course, he doesn't
have a penis, and she...

28
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:27,842
doesn't have anything.

29
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:30,511
Because they've made the ultimate
monogamous commitment.

30
00:01:30,631 --> 00:01:32,622
A sex-free relationship.

31
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:37,664
Well, this is all
very interesting,

32
00:01:37,669 --> 00:01:39,933
but, uh... why
exactly are you here?

33
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,297
Show them, Skip.

34
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,571
Skip had his nipples removed,...

35
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:47,564
one less erogenous zone
for him to think about.

36
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:50,376
And now, we'd like
you to remove mine.

37
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:58,318
Look, we're not crazy, ok?
We both very successful realtors.

38
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:00,594
Even in this market, we sold
more houses last year than...

39
00:02:00,714 --> 00:02:02,449
any other team in
west Los Angeles....

40
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:04,371
- Honey, let me explain.
- Alright.

41
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:06,488
My nipples are hard
all the time...

42
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:08,156
- All the time.
- All the time...

43
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,095
- It's like... it's like...
- It doesn't stop...

44
00:02:10,215 --> 00:02:12,065
big gumdrops on my...
It's embarrassing.

45
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:14,082
I mean I would like
to know what it's like...

46
00:02:14,202 --> 00:02:15,991
to have someone
look me in the eye...

47
00:02:16,111 --> 00:02:18,397
- ...for once.
- She has a beautiful mind....

48
00:02:18,517 --> 00:02:20,558
- Thank you.
- You too, honey.

49
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:26,641
So, how did you two meet?

50
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,113
Oh. Well... uh,...

51
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:31,051
we met at the national doll
collectors convention...

52
00:02:31,171 --> 00:02:33,196
in San Diego 5 years ago.

53
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,849
We've both been obsessed
with Barbie and Ken...

54
00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:39,406
- Obsessed...
- ...since we were little kids, and...

55
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:43,019
...we just want to take one more step
to becoming more like them.

56
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:45,279
- That's all.
- It's evolution.

57
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:48,701
So, what if the two
of you split up?

58
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:53,019
How would you explain these
modifications to your new partners?

59
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:55,503
We've both had tons
of sexual relationsips...

60
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:56,638
Tons.

61
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:58,788
And they always ended up
being about...

62
00:02:58,908 --> 00:03:00,672
ownership and exclusivity,...

63
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:02,953
not about love.

64
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:08,154
Eliminating sex allows us
to really relate.

65
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:11,828
We get to see each other outside
of our own selfish demands.

66
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:13,354
Think about it.

67
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,119
If Barbie and Ken had
been able to have sex,...

68
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:19,922
do you really think their marriage
would have lasted 50 years?

73
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:18,758
Excuse me. Can you tell me where
I might find a Dr. McNamara?

74
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,488
I have a package for him.

75
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:23,913
You found him. Just put it right
here on the desk, please.

76
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:27,398
Sign here, please.

77
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,478
Thank you, Doctor.

78
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,347
You're welcome.

79
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:38,976
Aren't you gonna open it?

80
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,292
Okay.

81
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,437
Ok, what uh...

82
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,569
Uh...what is this?

83
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:10,246
Hold on a second.

84
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:18,588
What are you doing?

85
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,153
Helping you with your package.

86
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,639
Hey, Sean, your 2 o'clock...

87
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:46,474
Mrs. Cox, please...

88
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,087
We can still fit you in.

89
00:05:48,092 --> 00:05:50,319
Thank you. I think
I've seen enough.

90
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:53,484
Did you want to finish?

91
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,220
Finish what?

92
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:57,985
Who are you?

93
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,687
Where did you come from?

94
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,794
Boy, you are grumpy.

95
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:04,800
No wonder Dr. Troy wanted
me to cheer you up.

96
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:14,518
Did you have anything
to do with this?

97
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:17,482
Is she still here? I didn't get
a chance to see her in person,

98
00:06:17,602 --> 00:06:18,867
but the agency
told me she was a 10.

99
00:06:18,987 --> 00:06:21,481
What the hell are you doing,
calling a stripper to the office?

100
00:06:21,601 --> 00:06:23,605
A stripper? Sean, I
wouldn't do that to you.

101
00:06:23,725 --> 00:06:25,046
She's a hooker...

102
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,148
- You bought me a prostitute?
- Of course I did....

103
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:28,543
What the hell's wrong with you?

104
00:06:28,663 --> 00:06:31,480
You've been wallowing in misery
ever since Julia took the kids to New York.

105
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,339
I was just trying to
make you feel better.

106
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:35,065
Cheap sex is not what
I need right now.

107
00:06:35,185 --> 00:06:37,470
In fact, I'm not interested in
any kind of sex right now.

108
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,199
I'm thinking about
taking a break....

109
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:41,331
- A break from sex.
- What's' wrong with that?

110
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:43,136
Well, nothing, if you
want to be a priest...

111
00:06:43,141 --> 00:06:45,998
or just wallow in your mid-life
self-pitying crisis bullshit.

112
00:06:46,118 --> 00:06:48,988
- It is not 'self-pity, it's self-preservation, ok?
- Alright.

113
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:51,592
The last time I jumped into bed
with someone after Julia,

114
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:54,060
I wound up with Teddy.
And after that, with some...

115
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,086
drug addict stabbing
me in the leg.

116
00:06:56,091 --> 00:06:58,398
Which is why I thought
I should pick this time.

117
00:06:58,518 --> 00:06:59,427
Alright?

118
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:03,511
You know...

119
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,679
maybe Tracy...

120
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:07,383
had a point.

121
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,431
More often than not,
sex ruins relationships.

122
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:15,234
And that's what messed up
me and Julia his time.

123
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:19,335
That's what's complicated almost
every relationship I've ever had.

124
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:29,816
I appreciate your concern
for me.

125
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:32,351
Next time put it in a card.

126
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:35,412
Thank you

127
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,634
Oh, I ate too much.

128
00:07:37,754 --> 00:07:39,779
Oh, thanks for the surprise
tonight, sweetie...

129
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:42,667
- Ok? I'll call you later.
- Wait. Honestly.

130
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,603
Have I gained weight since we
started dating?

131
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:49,309
Sweetheart, you look fantastic.
Trust me,... Gotta go.

132
00:07:49,429 --> 00:07:51,496
I am a little freaked
out about this.

133
00:07:51,616 --> 00:07:53,641
I mean, just answer me honestly.

134
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,494
Do I need to start
smoking again?

135
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:58,306
Kimber

136
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,540
Christian

137
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:01,747
- Yes.
- This is my friend Lola.

138
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,302
Hey.

139
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:09,057
So, uh... you two go
wait in my office.

140
00:08:09,062 --> 00:08:11,062
I'll be in in a second.

141
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:19,033
She's got a problem. Ok?
Not you.

142
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:24,003
Sometimes I feel
that's how I look.

143
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:26,734
So,...

144
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:28,669
you're uh...
Lola...

145
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,674
- Wolad...
- Wlodkowski.

146
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:32,172
Wlodkowski....

147
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,850
- What are you grinning at?
- I'm just...

148
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:42,700
I'm just real happy for you.
Is that so bad?

149
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,352
Happy for what?

150
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,946
You know...

151
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:51,158
He's a bit of an idiot, but he is
a very good surgeon....

152
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:54,383
- Ok.
- We're friends. Lola is not gay.

153
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:57,236
Me? No. Please.

154
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:59,906
I am a card-carrying hetero.

155
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:03,345
Although... Liz would
be the first girl

156
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,350
I'd call if I was so inclined.

157
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:08,081
Yeah, we met at
Adam and Eve's.

158
00:09:08,201 --> 00:09:10,036
I've been going there
since I was a kid.

159
00:09:10,156 --> 00:09:11,482
The nudist camp?

160
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,142
Lizzie.

161
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,244
Who knew?

162
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:20,616
I was looking for something to
help me love myself again...

163
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,960
after my divorce.

164
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,571
Sure....

165
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,926
- So, how can we help you?
- She needs her moles removed.

166
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:34,068
I noticed them at the pool,
and she came over to me...

167
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,865
all on her high horse,
gonna tell me that...

168
00:09:35,985 --> 00:09:39,292
Yeah, well, she was staring,
which we do not we do.

169
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,529
But it's common
with the nubees.

170
00:09:41,534 --> 00:09:43,849
They get all distracted
by genitals...

171
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,050
and... all the bare flesh.

172
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:49,110
In any case, I told
her that you would...

173
00:09:49,115 --> 00:09:51,285
removed them with no
scar and that...

174
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,188
you would have give her
a significant discount...

175
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:56,228
because she has no insurance.

176
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:00,766
Of course.
You know that any...

177
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,273
friend of Lizzie's
is a friend of ours.

178
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,977
In fact, because you're such a
good friend, we'll just...

179
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,140
throw in some free lipo....

180
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:13,323
- You mean to make me skinny?
- Um hmm.

181
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:17,878
You know...

182
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:20,514
I just figured, you know, you're
walking around nude all the time.

183
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,150
Maybe you just want to streamline
your silhouette a little bit...

184
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:25,122
- Oh, my God.
- I didn't mean any...

185
00:10:25,127 --> 00:10:27,585
No, I am not insulted,
Liz, not insulted.

186
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:30,530
He is just a victim of
his self-loathing, really.

187
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:33,599
Thanks, Doctor. But um...

188
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:37,470
I'll pass on the lipo.
I'm fine with the way I am...

189
00:10:38,252 --> 00:10:41,658
You know, maybe you should come
up to Adam and Eve sometime.

190
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:45,261
People discover all sorts of
things about themselves.

191
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,465
It's hard to keep the secrets
when you're naked.

192
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:52,985
Alright, I have no problem
getting naked.

193
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:56,856
Oh, well, social nudity is
something else.

194
00:10:56,956 --> 00:11:00,493
It requires dropping facades
and pretentions.

195
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:09,616
You've never had a really
big woman, have you, Doc?

196
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,324
Do I make you nervous?

197
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:15,603
Nervous?
No. I...

198
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,079
Not a bit.

199
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,312
You're quite a lotta gal, Lola.

200
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:22,446
Not too much gal for you?

201
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:29,059
Now, some men just aren't
ready for me...

202
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,935
and I am not just
talking about the pounds.

203
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:38,659
Hey, you two...

204
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:40,689
Is it time to get a room?

205
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:46,834
Uh... no.

206
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:49,899
But I think it's time we took a
look at those moles.

207
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,611
Mrs. Pierce...

208
00:11:57,616 --> 00:12:00,888
Before we get started, I'd like you
to look over these consent forms.

209
00:12:01,008 --> 00:12:03,317
It's to remind you that
this is an elective surgery...

210
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:05,322
and you're aware of the risks.

211
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:09,156
Skip already told me what to
expect. I'm not concerned.

212
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,161
I'm excited, actually.

213
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,538
Now, are you planning
to have kids?

214
00:12:13,658 --> 00:12:15,447
Because if you're
hoping to breastfeed...

215
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:18,904
Oh, I can't have children.
Ken and Barbie never did, so...

216
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:21,012
Of course.

217
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:23,768
If you would open your robe?

218
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:27,377
And you promise there
won't be scarring?

219
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:29,713
Ah, yeah.

220
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:32,729
Um, that's why I want to
put you under anesthesia

221
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:35,552
Z-plasties will stop any
keloids from forming.

222
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:38,919
Stop trying to impress me
with the details, Dr. Sexy....

223
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,611
I just want to know
I get my body back.

224
00:12:40,731 --> 00:12:42,453
If you want to get
your body back,...

225
00:12:42,573 --> 00:12:44,543
try 20 minutes on the
treadmill every day.

226
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:46,699
Those gerbil wheels?
Please.

227
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,151
I get enough exercise
in the bedroom,

228
00:12:50,156 --> 00:12:51,565
thank you very much.

229
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,419
You don't glow like
this if you're not...

230
00:12:53,424 --> 00:12:55,002
having great sex
five times a week.

231
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:57,007
Believe you me...

232
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:00,875
- That tickles.
- Sorry.

233
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,349
That's ok.
I've always been sensitive.

234
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,748
Well, dermal nerve networks
and concentrations...

235
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:09,355
of tissue around the
ducts along with...

236
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:13,910
minute hair follicles in
the areola itself, all contribute...

237
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:16,595
to the area's hypersensitivity.

238
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,832
Which is a fancy
way of saying...

239
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,595
your nipples... Our...

240
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,700
nipples were designed
for pleasure.

241
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:26,739
Well, you've never
worn a bra before.

242
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,437
They have seen their
share of pleasure...

243
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:32,206
over the years.

244
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:34,413
It'll be a relief
to have them gone.

245
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:39,309
So you're not really interested
in sex anymore?

246
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:40,831
Let me tell you something.

247
00:13:40,951 --> 00:13:43,599
When you don't have
to worry about it anymore...

248
00:13:43,719 --> 00:13:46,324
you realize how much
more there is to life.

249
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,591
I thought being nudist wasn't
about having sex all the time.

250
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:53,716
It's not. I'm talking about
my life outside the fold.

251
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:55,262
Really?

252
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:57,503
So between that and
doing life...

253
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,334
you basically never have
your clothes on.

254
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,339
Well...
It is how God made us.

255
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,612
Some are better than others, huh?

256
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:09,746
Sorry to be blunt, Lola.

257
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,216
You're not my type.

258
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,679
You go for the more shallow,
superficial dates.

259
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,490
You poor man.

260
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:23,132
You have no idea what you're
missing, do you?

261
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:26,994
Don't you worry about
what you'll be missing?

262
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,929
- Sex wise?
- Yeah.

263
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:31,814
I mean, it's not like it's
a big mystery anymore.

264
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,673
Two people kiss...
tongues touch...

265
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:37,443
hands rub the same parts...

266
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,488
Maybe they pinch and grab...

267
00:14:39,493 --> 00:14:41,833
Maybe they smack an
ass cheek or two...

268
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,973
Someone gets hard,
someone gets wet,

269
00:14:43,978 --> 00:14:45,546
you trade some fluids...

270
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,688
then it's all about
the in and the out,

271
00:14:47,693 --> 00:14:49,438
and the up and the down...

272
00:14:49,558 --> 00:14:53,592
Someone screams, 'Oh, baby, yes'
or 'Oh, God, please' and then...

273
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,532
Poof.

274
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:57,541
It's done.

275
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:01,729
Yeah, you put it like that,
I guess I see your point.

276
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,836
Trust me.
I'm celebate...

277
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:06,538
and I've never been happier.

278
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,943
That was the best orgasm
I've ever had.

279
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,050
Liz is going to put you into
uh... twilight.

280
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:24,451
That sounds delightful.

281
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:27,293
Yeah. And no scars, I promise.
I'm good at that.

282
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,660
You're good at a lot of things.

283
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,765
I'd put you in the top
6 or 7 percentile.

284
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,526
Just say it.

285
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:08,195
I'm a scumbag, pussy-crazed dog,
and I should be shot.

286
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,869
Get over yourself.
I'm not your priest.

287
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,453
This woman is a force of nature,
you know that? I mean...

288
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:15,235
she don't take no
for an answer.

289
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,910
Yeah. Well, as usual...
you got it wrong.

290
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,940
I am delighted.

291
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:22,242
What? That I had sex
with a fat chick?

292
00:16:22,362 --> 00:16:24,537
No, because you
couldn't get to her.

293
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,396
You're right.

294
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,856
You know what? You could take a
page out of her book.

295
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:38,464
She and living proof that
beauty is not everything.

296
00:16:38,584 --> 00:16:39,955
You know
what I'm saying?

297
00:16:40,075 --> 00:16:42,245
I mean, it's how you
feel on the inside....

298
00:16:42,365 --> 00:16:44,101
- Right?
- Wait.

299
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:46,867
You do something shitty and then
you rub my face in it?

300
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:48,786
And because
I don't fall apart,...

301
00:16:48,906 --> 00:16:50,849
you give me a lecture on
what's wrong with me?

302
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:53,044
You're an idiot,
you know that.

303
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,446
Send these to Pathology.

304
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,685
You're right,
I was out of line.

305
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,613
Yeah, well save it for
someone who cares...

306
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:06,485
the other idiot, Kimber.

307
00:17:06,605 --> 00:17:10,262
She actually believes
that the two of you are gonna...

308
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:13,045
walk into the monogamous...
Ken and Barbie sunset together.

309
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:14,555
God bless her.

310
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:21,206
Oh my God... seriously?

311
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:24,910
I'm... I'm gonna wet myself.
Look at this.

312
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:27,577
Fiber...

313
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:29,646
Hoodia...

314
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:31,345
Appetite suppressants...

315
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,414
Oh, yeah, here.
This and my favorite one...

316
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,604
This sucks the fats
out of the food...

317
00:17:35,609 --> 00:17:37,769
and then leaks it
out of your colon.

318
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,959
I have been killing
myself to stay a size 0...

319
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:44,696
while you're off discovering
your inner chubby chaser.

320
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,501
She wasn't... all that fat.

321
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:52,900
Oh honey, I saw her. You needed
MapQuest to find her vagina.

322
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,874
But what you don't understand
is... this is great.

323
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:59,878
Like, I'm happy. I can
finally just... relax.

324
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,916
We... Now I know......

325
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:07,469
we're still gonna be having
sex when we're old and fat...

326
00:18:08,512 --> 00:18:09,650
Where you going?

327
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,852
I'm gonna go raid your
freezer because...

328
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:15,961
I swear I saw some Cherry Garcia
in there and I've never had it.

329
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:30,671
Come on, baby...

330
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:32,968
Dive into your diva.

331
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:39,618
Timber -- here comes Kimber.

332
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:45,512
Left...

333
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:51,501
Are you watching?

334
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,399
Wait...hold...hang...
hang on, stop.

335
00:18:58,404 --> 00:19:00,404
It...I'm sorry, it hurts me.

336
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:03,804
Alright, I'll get two spoons and
fudge sauce, I'll be right back.

337
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,967
Stay right here,
I'll be right back.

338
00:19:05,972 --> 00:19:07,972
- I promise.
- Take your time.

339
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:12,072
Found it.

340
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:19,289
Wow, this is really good.
Here.

341
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,822
I've got you a spoon.

342
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,827
Come on.
Let's get fat.

343
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,780
You two seem very happy together.

344
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:45,017
Of course. He's my
fantasy come true.

345
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:47,996
Wouldn't you be?

346
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:10,370
Honey, I'm home.

347
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,078
Darling.
Let me get that for you.

348
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:16,615
You had a hard day,
Come in and relax.

349
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:19,115
What's that smell?

350
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:24,289
I made your favorite --
roast chicken.

351
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:32,662
Leg or breast tonight, honey?...

352
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:35,634
- How about both?
- Oh, you're so silly....

353
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:43,508
- Are you okay?
- Huh? Oh, fine.

354
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:45,606
Just tired.

355
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:47,611
I understand, let's go to bed....

356
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,187
- 'Night.
- 'Night.

357
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,659
Oh, your hand...

358
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:08,300
- It's so soft.
- It's my new lotion.

359
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:16,218
Honey, what if we push the
beds together tonight?

360
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:19,401
We've never done that before.
Something wrong, Sean?

361
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,475
I was talking with Christian
at the office today...

362
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,278
and he mentioned something
to me about blowjobs.

363
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,385
And well...
it sounded like fun.

364
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:28,938
You mean putting your
penis in my mouth?...

365
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,714
- Isn't that sex?
- Not from what I understand.

366
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:34,459
I thought we should try it.

367
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,596
Okay, as long as it's not sex.

368
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:44,146
I guess you should pull
down your pants first....

369
00:21:48,105 --> 00:21:48,783
What?

370
00:21:48,903 --> 00:21:51,204
No wonder we've never
done this before...

371
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:53,209
Look.

372
00:21:57,582 --> 00:21:59,171
Are you okay?

373
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:01,953
Fine.

374
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:08,264
I hope he's happy.

375
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:10,638
She's a perfect doll now....

376
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:20,934
- Have you seen my patient?
- Ah, yeah.

377
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:22,240
I saw way too much.

378
00:22:22,245 --> 00:22:24,643
She said her stomach
was grumbling.

379
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:30,110
Oh, Jesus...

380
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:31,645
You'll blind someone.

381
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,059
Do you have a pannini press?

382
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:35,363
 'cause I would kill for a
grilled ham and cheese.

383
00:22:35,483 --> 00:22:38,811
This is not your personal feeding trough,
and it's not Adam and Eve either. Here.

384
00:22:38,931 --> 00:22:41,193
Put this on, until
I find you a tent.

385
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:43,957
Well I'm...sorry. I just...I'm so
used to being in the buff...

386
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:46,497
Yeah, well we don't need to see
your flabby flesh around here.

387
00:22:46,617 --> 00:22:48,423
Oh, I guess you thought
you were dreaming when...

388
00:22:48,543 --> 00:22:50,249
we humped like bunnies
in your exam room?

389
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,041
Bunnies? I remember
riding an elephant.

390
00:22:52,161 --> 00:22:54,000
And then I got stuck
in an overgrown bush.

391
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:55,830
Why would I give a shit
what you think?

392
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:58,355
You're just a shallow asshole
whose in denial of the fact that...

393
00:22:58,475 --> 00:23:00,826
some day you're gonna wake up
and be fat, sagging and ugly.

394
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:03,618
I am an asshole, and
maybe one day...

395
00:23:03,623 --> 00:23:05,884
I will wake up fat,
saggy and ugly.

396
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:08,320
But right now, I am
embracing beauty.

397
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:11,990
And beauty is happiness,
beauty is power...

398
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,794
beauty is confidence.

399
00:23:13,914 --> 00:23:15,852
And don't tell me
you don't agree.

400
00:23:15,972 --> 00:23:18,279
It's time to go back
to the watering hole,

401
00:23:18,284 --> 00:23:19,497
hungry hippo.

402
00:23:19,617 --> 00:23:21,433
You... are checking out.

403
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:35,486
Yeah?...

404
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:39,348
- You got a sec?
- Yeah. Actually, I was just...

405
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:42,821
thinking about coming
over to apologize.

406
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:44,093
Um... I was...

407
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:47,803
was harsh, and... and you didn't
deserve it, and...

408
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:51,085
I had a... a really
fun time with you.

409
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:52,426
Ok, enough.

410
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,831
I liked you better
when you were honest.

411
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:57,169
Do you like being
called a hippo?

412
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:00,637
It was interesting...

413
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,346
Bracing.

414
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,565
And then uh...

415
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,777
it made me see something.

416
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:12,974
I screwed up.

417
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:16,446
Why?

418
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:21,126
Well, half the battle with
self-acceptance is...

419
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:24,095
acting as if you feel it
even when you don't.

420
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:27,837
And I have become a
really good actress.

421
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:32,928
I have all the right words,
and the right moves and...

422
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:35,373
it works most of the time...

423
00:24:36,371 --> 00:24:40,558
but... every now and then, I
want to crawl away and hide.

424
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:43,536
Like...

425
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:47,185
when I... get a bad
crush on a guy...

426
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:50,114
and... I know I'm never
gonna be in the running.

427
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:54,192
That's when I do something
bold and defiant.

428
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:58,063
Like walking around
the office naked?

429
00:24:59,064 --> 00:24:59,977
Yeah.

430
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:05,102
Look, I am not stupid
And I'm not blind.

431
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:09,210
I'm just a gorgeous, sexy woman
who's trapped in a fat body.

432
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,198
And I was raised to
think that it's...

433
00:25:13,318 --> 00:25:14,861
a sin to love myself...

434
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,649
any other way but the way I am.

435
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:23,383
Please, you're not
gonna turn into some...

436
00:25:23,503 --> 00:25:25,439
self-hating person now, are you?

437
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:29,789
I want to know what it feels
like... not to pretend...

438
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:32,664
I don't care about
what people think.

439
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:36,313
I am tired of...

440
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:40,038
working so hard
at this self-acceptance.

441
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:45,241
So, be honest with me.

442
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:50,582
What will it take?
Lipo or... a tummy tuck?

443
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,260
Both.

444
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:10,546
I didn't think you'd
be out of bed so soon.

445
00:26:10,666 --> 00:26:13,266
Oh, look. I've never been
able to do this before.

446
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:15,373
No more gumdrops.
Smooth.

447
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:17,423
Just like Barbie now.

448
00:26:17,543 --> 00:26:20,662
Want to have a seat on the bed?
I'll check those stitches.

449
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:29,749
You did such great work.

450
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:32,801
I can't wait for Skip to see them.
He's going to love them.

451
00:26:32,921 --> 00:26:33,967
Yeah.

452
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,856
What's wrong? I didn't pull
a stitch or anything, did... ?

453
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:39,292
No, no, no. The surgery's fine.
It's just...

454
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:40,272
What?

455
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,135
I spent my whole career
trying to make...

456
00:26:44,255 --> 00:26:46,907
women's breasts look
more attractive... youthful...

457
00:26:47,027 --> 00:26:49,764
so their husbands or boyfriends
will notice them again.

458
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:53,211
And here you are with this
perfect, natural set, and...

459
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:58,316
you're happy because I've
completely desexualized you.

460
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,135
It's okay if you
do not understand.

461
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:04,596
Most people don't.

462
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,393
Well, I think I do
understand...

463
00:27:11,197 --> 00:27:15,200
- And... I think it is very sad.
- What are you talking about?

464
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,167
I had a moment
where I imagined...

465
00:27:20,172 --> 00:27:22,574
what it would be like
to give up sex...

466
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,353
to have that kind of
relationship when...

467
00:27:25,358 --> 00:27:27,474
you don't touch each
other, and it...

468
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,508
It what?

469
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:30,513
It isn't natural.

470
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,753
You're not just denying
the act of sex...

471
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:37,122
You're denying
intimacy, passion...

472
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,424
Skip and I are intimate.

473
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:41,588
We just...

474
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:44,429
choose not to be
physical about it.

475
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:50,151
But how can you choose to give up
that feeling you get when your skin...

476
00:27:50,271 --> 00:27:53,672
makes contact with someone else's
and that charge just...

477
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:56,370
runs through your whole body,...

478
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:58,964
 like every nerve inside
you just caught fire.

479
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:01,344
I mean, the way
you described it...

480
00:28:01,464 --> 00:28:04,596
hands grabbing, smacking...
That's about passion, fire.

481
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:07,294
And you're not trying
to catch your breath.

482
00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:09,699
You are trying to
inhale someone else's.

483
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:14,526
And it's complicated...
it's messy...

484
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:20,999
But I say every minute of the
pleasure is worth...

485
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:24,282
the pain it might bring later
because nothing on this Earth...

486
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:27,524
can make two people
feel that good.

487
00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:43,731
Lizzie, would you
give me a break.

488
00:28:43,851 --> 00:28:45,759
Lola, came to me and
asked me for lipo.

489
00:28:45,743 --> 00:28:49,961
You reduced a strong, proud woman
into a self-loathing wallflower.

490
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:53,026
No, I did not. All I did was
help her open open eyes.

491
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:54,849
You didn't help
her out, Christian.

492
00:28:54,854 --> 00:28:55,995
You broke her will....

493
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,002
- I did not.
- And why?

494
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:00,196
All because you're
not man enough...

495
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:04,142
to admit that you had a mind
boggling orgasm with a fat girl.

496
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:07,854
And you discovered someone
who has beauty...

497
00:29:07,859 --> 00:29:09,943
on the inside and it
scared you, and why?

498
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:13,084
Because you, underneath
that shell...

499
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:16,488
that handsome shell, is nothing.

500
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:19,770
And the only thing you can do
to make yourself feel better,...

501
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:22,994
is pull people down into
your own personal little hell...

502
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:25,920
- Ok, feel better?
- Yeah, I feel better...

503
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,236
And you know what?
Even better yet.

504
00:29:28,241 --> 00:29:29,946
I'm not doing the surgery.

505
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:43,076
- Hi, Liz.
- Hey, Jack...

506
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:45,517
- Liz.
- Hi Javier...

507
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:47,717
- Liz...
- Hi...Hi, Kyle.

508
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,024
Lizzie is throwing another fit.

509
00:29:56,144 --> 00:29:57,801
We need to find
another replacement....

510
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:58,992
What's going on?

511
00:29:59,112 --> 00:30:01,161
Nothing. It's gonna be fine.
Don't you worry.

512
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:02,398
Lola?

513
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:05,434
Hey, guys.

514
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:07,300
What are you doing here?

515
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:10,384
Saving your beautiful ass.
Take that gown off because...

516
00:30:10,389 --> 00:30:12,105
we're taking you out of here.

517
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,318
What the hell are you doing here?
You can't come in here.

518
00:30:14,323 --> 00:30:15,554
Get the hell out of here.

519
00:30:15,674 --> 00:30:18,178
Alright, you put the scalpel down
and nobody gets hurt.

520
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:19,946
You're kidnapping her?

521
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:23,154
Plastic surgery steals
a person's humanity.

522
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:26,288
Look, fellas, I...I just want
to shed a few pounds.

523
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:28,244
We won't let you do this.

524
00:30:28,249 --> 00:30:31,062
We love you exactly
the way you are.

525
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,710
Hey, if you want to keep ignoring
the world we live in, be my guest.

526
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:59,235
That's the difference
between us, doctor.

527
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,820
We don't live in your world.

528
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:02,825
We live someplace happier.

529
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:21,268
I'm sorry.

530
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:27,922
Are you sure they never make any
mistakes on these biopsies?

531
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:31,593
Look, it's not a death sentence.
We can...

532
00:31:31,935 --> 00:31:33,968
remove the tumor,
get rid of all the...

533
00:31:33,973 --> 00:31:36,708
tissue surrounding it so that
the melanoma cells are gone.

534
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:39,430
We can... do chemo,
follow up by radiation.

535
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:40,489
We?

536
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:43,766
You can beat this.

537
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:45,475
I did.

538
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:52,400
Chemo...

539
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:58,815
Well, that could be the
best diet ever, right?

540
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,418
I'll be a thin girl yet.

541
00:32:05,251 --> 00:32:07,492
My mother would be so proud.

542
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,927
Beautiful on the outside...

543
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:13,381
scarred and cancerous
on the inside.

544
00:32:13,386 --> 00:32:15,386
Lola, you're beautiful.

545
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:18,503
You will always be beautiful,
cancer or no cancer.

546
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:02,933
You're pathetic.

547
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:15,393
I didn't know you were gonna
be home so soon...

548
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:17,600
You weren't supposed
to see that.

549
00:33:17,605 --> 00:33:19,111
Yeah, well I did...

550
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:21,639
I can clean up after myself.

551
00:33:21,644 --> 00:33:24,430
No, that's fine. It'll stop
me from strangling you.

552
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:28,839
I just wanted to try
some of the things...

553
00:33:28,844 --> 00:33:30,903
that I've always
been afraid to eat.

554
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:32,861
Don't tell me that's
the first time...

555
00:33:32,866 --> 00:33:34,974
you shoved your fingers
down your throat.

556
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:37,503
No, it's not, but
it's the first time

557
00:33:37,508 --> 00:33:39,379
I've had pepperoni pizza...

558
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:41,176
Listen, just explain
something to me.

559
00:33:41,181 --> 00:33:43,216
Is this little experiment
over or not? Ok?

560
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:46,162
Because I don't do fat, and I don't do
whatever the hell it was in there

561
00:33:46,282 --> 00:33:48,117
when you were
throwing up, alright?

562
00:33:48,237 --> 00:33:50,361
which night I come
home. Understand?

563
00:33:56,768 --> 00:34:00,671
You know, when I was in
there, I was thinking...

564
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:03,478
that...

565
00:34:04,257 --> 00:34:06,310
I truly hate myself.

566
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:12,950
And... it's the reason why
I always go back to you,

567
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:16,454
Christian, is because you
hate me the best...

568
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:19,924
and, for some reason,
it just feels right.

569
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:22,249
What the hell are
you talking about?

570
00:34:22,254 --> 00:34:24,594
Go to brush your
teeth. Get some mints.

571
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:27,171
I have.

572
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:30,110
Look at me.

573
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:36,274
Turn around and look at me.

574
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:40,962
Why are you with me, Christian?
You think I'm stupid.

575
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:44,449
You think I am a slut.
You think I'm pathetic.

576
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:52,290
It's so clear to me now.

577
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:56,027
You hate yourself like I do.

578
00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:00,589
And that's why you always
come back to me...

579
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:04,368
because you think I am
all you deserve.

580
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:17,648
You were wrong about
the stupid part.

581
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:19,750
That was pretty smart.

582
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:22,518
Now go get dressed.

583
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:24,587
I need some dinner.

584
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:39,971
So we'll put that on the books
and see you next week.

585
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:42,050
And, again, thank you
for understanding...

586
00:35:42,055 --> 00:35:43,769
about that silly
little office prank.

587
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:46,072
Yes. Well, now that I've
met you, I can see...

588
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:49,280
you're not the type to
engage in that sort of thing.

589
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,520
Bye.

590
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,212
Dr. McNamara.

591
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:54,780
I need to talk to you.

592
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:55,559
Skip.

593
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:57,586
Uh... I'm very busy right now.

594
00:35:57,706 --> 00:36:01,264
- If you'd ike to make an appointment...
- Tracy told me what happened.

595
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,791
Let's step into my office.

596
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:07,284
I'm not upset.

597
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,171
In fact, I'm...

598
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,700
I couldn't be more relieved.

599
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:13,032
I wanted to thank you...

600
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:14,400
- Thank me.
- Yeah.

601
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:17,808
It was bound to happen to
one of us, sooner or later,...

602
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:19,839
and I'm glad it finally did
because...

603
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:23,084
it...it helped me to finally
deal with who I really am.

604
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:26,594
You mean you don't want to pretend
that you're a doll anymore?

605
00:36:26,714 --> 00:36:29,453
No. No, no, I still see
myself as a model of Ken.

606
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:31,083
No, I meant that I can...

607
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:33,291
finally admit that I'm gay.

608
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:35,247
Joe,

609
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:37,866
would you like
to meet the doctor?

610
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,959
Nice to meet you, sir.

611
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:41,930
Joe's been a
"Don't ask, don't tell"...

612
00:36:41,935 --> 00:36:43,396
member on the army since '97.

613
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:46,537
And... an avid doll
enthusiast like myself.

614
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:48,801
Skip and I have known
each other for years...

615
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:50,770
only we could never
admit how we really felt.

616
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:52,238
Now that we're together...

617
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:54,289
we're gonna explore
the new postmodern...

618
00:36:54,294 --> 00:36:55,841
version of a real relationship.

619
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:57,949
One that makes sense for us.

620
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:00,813
You mean...

621
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:04,455
- between Ken and G.I. Joe?
- See? I told you he'd get it.

622
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,587
Don't tell me you're here to
have your nipples removed.

623
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:09,660
No, no, no.
Calf implants...

624
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:12,396
"Anatomically correct"
is our motto.

625
00:37:24,141 --> 00:37:25,282
Wow.

626
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:29,780
- Nice pad.
- Do you like it?

627
00:37:31,115 --> 00:37:33,351
You really live the life, huh?...

628
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:36,382
- Do you want something to drink?
- I would love a drink.

629
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:38,387
Hey. Hi, Sean.

630
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:43,325
That's Kimber.

631
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,559
Looks like you're having fun.

632
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:49,864
Oh, yeah. Someone back there
is getting a little hungry.

633
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:54,864
Hey, Sean.

634
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:03,178
Tracy, what are you doing here?

635
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:06,183
I love your Malibu beach house.

636
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:09,397
It could use some color,
but it's really quite lovely.

637
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,621
I'm sorry about Skip.

638
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:15,254
No, you're not.

639
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:17,259
Neither am I.

640
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:21,927
I just can't believe I couldn't
see who he was really was...

641
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:25,052
even with all the pink
cardigans and perfect hair.

642
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:35,179
Kimmy, won't all that
sugar make me fat?

643
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:38,082
Oh, God, no. This
is for Christian.

644
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:41,185
But I'm gonna get you
some ice cubes.

645
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:45,699
- But I don't have any nipples.
- Well, you have a lot to learn.

646
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:48,754
The body has thousands of
sensitive spots...

647
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:51,595
and we're just gonna have
to work to find yours.

648
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:54,226
Strawberries.

649
00:38:54,231 --> 00:38:56,128
Come on, ladies, ladies.
Come on.

650
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:57,697
Gabfest is over.

651
00:38:57,702 --> 00:39:00,004
Sean... how's it hanging, baby?

652
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:03,607
You're beautiful, ladies.
Ready to get back to business?

653
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:08,979
Keep those strawberries chilled.

654
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,652
What's Tracy doing here?

655
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:19,200
I'm sorry, buddy, but
two Barbies are...

656
00:39:19,205 --> 00:39:21,821
better than one. You
know what I'm saying?...

657
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:23,387
Don't I know you
from somewhere?

658
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:25,091
I'm the delivery
girl from last week.

659
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:27,264
I love hookers.
Right?

660
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:30,178
You can pay 'em to be
whoever you want 'em to be.

661
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:32,891
Have fun.

662
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:35,525
Ladies.
Ha ha ha.

663
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,374
Who do you want to be, Sean?

664
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:45,588
You know...

665
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:51,288
Tonight I think you should
just be yourself.

666
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,698
Maybe it's you who wants to
be somebody else.

667
00:39:56,794 --> 00:39:59,397
I've 'done it
that way too before...

668
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:02,767
- Ok.
- Good.

669
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,745
So, who do you want to be?

670
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:16,419
I don't know.

671
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:18,870
Someone else.

672
