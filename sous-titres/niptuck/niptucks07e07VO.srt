00:00:00,854 --> 00:00:02,494
Previously on Nip/Tuck...

2
00:00:02,614 --> 00:00:05,269
Christian Troy,
Sean McNamara, right?

3
00:00:05,389 --> 00:00:07,883
I was seeing
the future of medicine.

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,300
- Plastic surgery?
- The wave of the future.

5
00:00:12,538 --> 00:00:14,331
Tell me what you don't
like about yourself.

6
00:00:14,451 --> 00:00:15,925
- My ass.
- My eyes.

7
00:00:16,045 --> 00:00:17,632
- My knees.
- Your knees?

8
00:00:17,752 --> 00:00:18,890
Everything.

9
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:25,214
Your right eye is half a
millimeter higher than your left.

10
00:00:25,334 --> 00:00:28,027
I'll give you Botox
here and here.

11
00:00:28,147 --> 00:00:30,555
The breasts could go
one size bigger.

12
00:00:30,675 --> 00:00:33,065
And finish off with
some abdominal lipo.

13
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,053
Would you have to fix anything?

14
00:00:37,173 --> 00:00:38,559
Liposuction right here.

15
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:40,939
Now, your boobs,
lift them just a little bit.

16
00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:43,702
Here... and here.

17
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:47,883
You are a model
of physical perfection.

18
00:00:48,003 --> 00:00:49,254
But I can be better.

19
00:00:49,374 --> 00:00:51,412
I've identified these
as my problem areas.

20
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,984
Diet? Is that what we tell
the 20 people a week...

21
00:00:54,104 --> 00:00:56,746
who come in here?
We're in the quick fix biz.

22
00:00:57,352 --> 00:00:59,396
I think you could go up
to a double "D".

23
00:00:59,516 --> 00:01:01,806
- A "C"
- Can I go bigger?

24
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,080
I want to do whatever
it takes to be beautiful.

25
00:01:13,294 --> 00:01:16,926
Beauty is symmetry,
and you don't have any.

26
00:01:23,805 --> 00:01:26,600
Tell us what you don't
like about yourselves.

27
00:01:28,012 --> 00:01:30,921
Is that what you still ask
all your consults?

28
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:32,726
Well done.
You remembered.

29
00:01:32,846 --> 00:01:34,768
- Yeah.
- Do you remember us?

30
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,953
Of course.
Uh, Maureen and...

31
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:41,217
Marshall Ayres from Miami.

32
00:01:42,104 --> 00:01:44,136
You first came
to see us in '02, right?

33
00:01:44,256 --> 00:01:46,554
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Real estate brokers, right?

34
00:01:46,674 --> 00:01:49,935
"If you want someone who cares,
buy your home from Ayres."

35
00:01:50,454 --> 00:01:53,463
Yeah, we figured
that getting dual facelifts

36
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:55,907
would help to boost
our business back then.

37
00:01:56,027 --> 00:01:57,917
The housing market
was so hot, you know,

38
00:01:58,037 --> 00:01:59,956
you needed to do anything
you could to compete.

39
00:02:00,076 --> 00:02:01,497
Image was everything,

40
00:02:01,617 --> 00:02:04,306
and projecting success
meant looking younger.

41
00:02:04,426 --> 00:02:06,900
Of course. And those are
ours, too, aren't they?

42
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,296
Yep. Oh, and...

43
00:02:09,915 --> 00:02:11,662
My calf implants.

44
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:14,070
They still look great.
Don't they?

45
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,388
- Yeah.
- Huh?

46
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:17,698
So what brings you
to Los Angeles?

47
00:02:17,818 --> 00:02:18,699
You guys.

48
00:02:18,767 --> 00:02:21,113
Ok, what were you thinking?
Maybe a feather lift,

49
00:02:21,233 --> 00:02:24,162
or remove some of
the puffiness around the eyes?

50
00:02:24,915 --> 00:02:27,170
We want you to, um...

51
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,379
Reverse everything.

52
00:02:31,438 --> 00:02:34,215
You guys sold us
a bad bill of goods.

53
00:02:36,262 --> 00:02:37,849
So let me get this straight.

54
00:02:37,969 --> 00:02:40,388
You want us to undo
your facelifts.

55
00:02:40,508 --> 00:02:42,251
And take out the implants.

56
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:45,432
- So you can look worse.
- So we can look real.

57
00:02:46,503 --> 00:02:47,915
Forgive me,
but...

58
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:50,014
for your ages you both
look pretty good.

59
00:02:50,134 --> 00:02:51,925
Pretty good?
I think they look great.

60
00:02:52,045 --> 00:02:54,067
The real issue is not
about undoing anything,

61
00:02:54,187 --> 00:02:56,692
it's about teaching you about
the techniques that we use today.

62
00:02:56,812 --> 00:02:57,957
You don't get it.

63
00:02:58,077 --> 00:02:59,939
It's not about
refining a procedure,

64
00:03:00,059 --> 00:03:01,747
it's the whole concept.

65
00:03:01,867 --> 00:03:05,329
Look, back in the 1940s,
doctors recommended cigarettes

66
00:03:05,449 --> 00:03:07,347
to their patients
to calm them down.

67
00:03:07,467 --> 00:03:10,017
Now look what we know
about those cancer sticks.

68
00:03:10,477 --> 00:03:11,646
It's no different.

69
00:03:11,766 --> 00:03:14,257
Nobody ever died from looking
too young or looking too beautiful.

70
00:03:14,377 --> 00:03:15,804
If you want to take
them out, that's fine.

71
00:03:15,924 --> 00:03:17,270
Do whatever you gotta , ok?

72
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,994
But it's not gonna cost you any less
than it did when we put them in.

73
00:03:20,062 --> 00:03:22,843
We were hoping
there would be no charge.

74
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,424
Our business has dropped

75
00:03:26,793 --> 00:03:30,341
over 50% in the last 3 years,

76
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:32,528
just because of
how we look.

77
00:03:32,648 --> 00:03:35,016
We used to be the faces
you could trust.

78
00:03:35,287 --> 00:03:37,530
But with this tightness,
we look like...

79
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,272
we're just advertising
our own self-loathing.

80
00:03:40,392 --> 00:03:43,197
Would you buy a house
from someone like that?

81
00:03:43,317 --> 00:03:45,422
We made the choice
to get the work done,

82
00:03:45,542 --> 00:03:48,826
but we were led to believe
that society accepted it.

83
00:03:48,946 --> 00:03:52,004
You know, the times
they are a-changing,

84
00:03:52,272 --> 00:03:54,237
and if you guys
don't keep up,

85
00:03:54,357 --> 00:03:57,242
you're gonna get
swept away just like us.

86
00:04:04,006 --> 00:04:05,614
Oh, Sean.

87
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:08,809
Christian, would you
grow up, for God sakes?!

88
00:04:09,179 --> 00:04:11,020
For God sakes.

89
00:04:13,715 --> 00:04:14,853
Dr. Cruz?

90
00:04:16,961 --> 00:04:17,972
Hi.

91
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:19,622
I'm Daniella Creighton.

92
00:04:20,643 --> 00:04:23,352
- Your friendly drug dealer.
- Oh, right, right, right, right.

93
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:24,541
Very cute.

94
00:04:24,992 --> 00:04:25,994
Chicken?

95
00:04:26,114 --> 00:04:27,828
I think it's a turkey.

96
00:04:28,663 --> 00:04:30,278
Uh, so what's
the, uh,

97
00:04:30,398 --> 00:04:33,000
new groundbreaking
anesthesia I must have?

98
00:04:33,068 --> 00:04:34,103
Sunedra.

99
00:04:34,414 --> 00:04:35,978
Prospropofol disodium.

100
00:04:36,098 --> 00:04:39,757
And it converts into propofol
once inside the body.

101
00:04:39,877 --> 00:04:41,055
Ok, well, hit me.

102
00:04:41,175 --> 00:04:43,998
Why is sunedra better
in 10 words or less?

103
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:47,164
Uh, eliminates
negative after-effects

104
00:04:47,284 --> 00:04:49,273
of general anesthesia

105
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,917
89% of...

106
00:04:53,072 --> 00:04:54,169
time.

107
00:04:54,702 --> 00:04:56,258
You just made it.

108
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,605
- Was that 10?
- Yeah, that was 10.

109
00:05:00,108 --> 00:05:01,462
What is it, Lizzie?

110
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,964
We came as soon
as we heard your shriek.

111
00:05:04,032 --> 00:05:05,325
Does this belong to you?

112
00:05:05,445 --> 00:05:07,488
I've never seen that
turkey before in my life.

113
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:09,128
Dr. Christian Troy.
How are you?

114
00:05:09,248 --> 00:05:10,682
- Daniella Creighton.
- Great.

115
00:05:10,802 --> 00:05:12,272
Penkala pharmaceuticals.

116
00:05:12,392 --> 00:05:14,447
Sean McNamara.
It's nice to meet you.

117
00:05:14,567 --> 00:05:16,305
It's nice to meet you, too.

118
00:05:16,425 --> 00:05:18,216
I've got some great discounts.

119
00:05:18,336 --> 00:05:21,025
Two of our best clients
recently took early retirement,

120
00:05:21,145 --> 00:05:22,649
so we're overstocked.

121
00:05:22,769 --> 00:05:24,353
Really?
Anybody we know?

122
00:05:24,473 --> 00:05:26,063
Dr. Chaiken
and Dr. Gaines.

123
00:05:26,183 --> 00:05:27,101
Chuck Gaines?

124
00:05:27,221 --> 00:05:28,805
Jesus, he's
younger than I am.

125
00:05:28,925 --> 00:05:30,330
I think he got depressed.

126
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:33,055
He kept saying how plastic
surgery was over and

127
00:05:33,175 --> 00:05:35,920
he didn't want to be the last
one to turn the lights out.

128
00:05:36,472 --> 00:05:38,393
So, will you
take a look at

129
00:05:38,513 --> 00:05:40,593
the clinical tests results
and get back to me?

130
00:05:40,713 --> 00:05:41,760
I sure will.

131
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,003
Even if it's a no.

132
00:05:43,071 --> 00:05:43,972
I will.

133
00:05:44,374 --> 00:05:46,006
It was really nice meeting you.

134
00:05:46,074 --> 00:05:48,123
It was really nice meeting you.

135
00:05:48,818 --> 00:05:50,525
- Yeah, see you.
- Ciao.

136
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:55,960
Was she really
coming on to me.

137
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,701
She was wearing
a wedding ring, Liz.

138
00:05:57,821 --> 00:05:58,691
Yeah, so?

139
00:05:58,811 --> 00:06:01,350
Married women have flirted
with me before.

140
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:04,027
I mean, you know,
it's called bi-curious.

141
00:06:04,147 --> 00:06:05,534
It's called buy my stuff.

142
00:06:05,654 --> 00:06:07,786
You know, I don't think
she was here just to...

143
00:06:07,906 --> 00:06:09,330
sell me drugs.

144
00:06:09,771 --> 00:06:11,435
I mean,
after 30 years of...

145
00:06:11,555 --> 00:06:13,935
being a lesbian,
I think that I have some...

146
00:06:14,055 --> 00:06:15,508
instincts about these things,
you know.

147
00:06:15,628 --> 00:06:17,198
Fine.
Just be careful, ok?

148
00:06:17,318 --> 00:06:19,744
You only have one
kidney left.

149
00:06:21,877 --> 00:06:23,281
Oh, you Turkey.

150
00:06:26,562 --> 00:06:29,606
Couples coming in to have
their plastic surgery reversed.

151
00:06:29,726 --> 00:06:31,716
Doctors like Gaines
closing their doors.

152
00:06:31,836 --> 00:06:33,691
This might be a trend
we're looking at.

153
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:36,854
Jesus, one couple and a retiree
and you start to panic.

154
00:06:38,377 --> 00:06:40,803
I'm just saying it might be
smart to diversify,

155
00:06:40,923 --> 00:06:43,397
maybe bring on a dermatologist,
do more fillers.

156
00:06:43,465 --> 00:06:44,886
You ever eaten
at Lawry's?

157
00:06:45,006 --> 00:06:47,327
It didn't change its menu when
the rest of the whole country

158
00:06:47,447 --> 00:06:49,135
decided to change
its eating habits.

159
00:06:49,255 --> 00:06:51,126
It stuck with what
it did best, right?

160
00:06:51,246 --> 00:06:53,034
Meats, potatoes, salads.

161
00:06:53,154 --> 00:06:55,175
Plastic surgery will die
when people begin

162
00:06:55,243 --> 00:06:57,813
to look at themselves
for beauty and self-esteem.

163
00:06:57,933 --> 00:07:00,250
And a herd of geese
will fly up my ass.

Sean

169
00:07:50,955 --> 00:07:53,950
You're the perfect
candidate for injectibles.

170
00:07:54,758 --> 00:07:56,476
- You a smoker, Sean?
- No.

171
00:07:56,596 --> 00:07:57,815
- Never?
- No.

172
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,546
You drink, though.

173
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:01,304
Looking at your face,

174
00:08:01,424 --> 00:08:03,690
I'd say you're
a 3-scotch-a-night man.

175

dehydration.

177
00:08:07,992 --> 00:08:10,716
Nothing turns you into
an old man faster.

178
00:08:10,836 --> 00:08:12,452
I can see
I need some help.

179
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:14,520
What is your plan?

180
00:08:14,588 --> 00:08:18,554
Let's start with 15cc of
cosmoderm in the lip les.

181
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,980
Been feeling a little bitter
and judgmental lately?

182
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,517
Now no one will know
what you're thinking.

183
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:28,971
They'll just be drawn
to your positive,

184
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,587
boyish charm.

185
00:08:32,981 --> 00:08:34,772
10cc of radiesse,

186
00:08:35,183 --> 00:08:36,646
bye-bye, jowls.

187
00:08:37,749 --> 00:08:39,992
10cc of lidocaine...

188
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,126
And definitely some Botox.

189
00:08:46,918 --> 00:08:49,395
How amazing is that?

190
00:08:52,726 --> 00:08:54,835
- Not bad.
- Stay there.

191
00:08:56,224 --> 00:08:59,186
I don't do this for
everyone, but...

192
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:02,383
you are so cute.

193
00:09:03,937 --> 00:09:06,366
You don't feel
the winds of change.

194
00:09:07,086 --> 00:09:09,880
Plastic surgery is just
not cool anymore.

195
00:09:10,859 --> 00:09:13,537
We're being called
to a higher purpose.

196
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:16,253
People just feel
wrong about...

197
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,466
self-mutilation
for youth and prestige.

198
00:09:19,751 --> 00:09:22,645
And who has
2 weeks' recovery time?

199
00:09:23,164 --> 00:09:24,557
It is so 2004.

200
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:27,396
So toxins and face fillers
are your higher purpose?

201
00:09:27,516 --> 00:09:29,996
What's yours?
Dare I ask?

202
00:09:30,063 --> 00:09:33,349
I haven't found it yet,
but at the moment, I just...

203
00:09:33,701 --> 00:09:36,981
mutilate people
for youth and prestige.

204
00:09:38,699 --> 00:09:40,925
Call me the face of 2004.

205
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:46,396
Did you have a chance to read
the results from the clinical trials?

206
00:09:46,516 --> 00:09:50,181
Um... no. I'm sorry,
but I have not.

207
00:09:54,555 --> 00:09:55,922
Listen, um...

208
00:09:55,989 --> 00:09:57,037
Dani.

209
00:09:58,158 --> 00:09:58,962
Dani.

210
00:10:04,084 --> 00:10:06,066
I feel very comfortable

211
00:10:06,186 --> 00:10:09,267
staying
with the propofol.

212
00:10:09,635 --> 00:10:11,896
I'm used to it, and, um...

213
00:10:13,188 --> 00:10:15,129
I'm just gonna stay with it.

214
00:10:15,249 --> 00:10:16,443
Ok, then.

215
00:10:18,163 --> 00:10:20,227
Well, it was nice
to have met you.

216
00:10:20,347 --> 00:10:22,062
Very nice
to meet you, too.

217
00:10:27,221 --> 00:10:28,796
You wouldn't want to...

218
00:10:30,023 --> 00:10:31,775
I don't know, um...

219
00:10:32,695 --> 00:10:35,725
Have lunch with me
sometime, would you?

220
00:10:36,745 --> 00:10:38,616
I promise,
no shop talk.

221
00:10:38,736 --> 00:10:41,699
How do you think your husband's
gonna feel about that?

222
00:10:44,538 --> 00:10:46,887
We're...
we're separated.

223
00:10:49,285 --> 00:10:51,662
But you're right.
I'm sorry.

224
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:56,172
I just...
I have these thoughts...

225
00:10:56,707 --> 00:10:59,854
Fantasies, and I never
act on them, but...

226
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,463
you just...
you seem so...

227
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:03,584
Available?

228
00:11:05,827 --> 00:11:07,102
Beautiful.

229
00:11:08,741 --> 00:11:10,130
Oh, God.

230
00:11:10,632 --> 00:11:14,381
I'm so sorry. I'm just...
I'm going through a phase.

231
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,666
I don't eat lunch.

232
00:11:26,783 --> 00:11:29,012
We always have
a lot of yogurt here.

233
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,439
On the other hand...

234
00:11:32,727 --> 00:11:35,053
I'm very partial...

235
00:11:35,438 --> 00:11:36,643
to dinner.

236
00:11:48,158 --> 00:11:50,006
I'm never gonna
have a facelift.

237
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,008
Botox maybe,
but no facelifts.

238
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,643
That's the reason you're only
an anesthesiologist, Lizzie,

239
00:11:54,763 --> 00:11:57,274
and not a successful
surgeon like myself.

240
00:11:57,549 --> 00:11:59,440
Ok? You're not willing
to go the distance.

241
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,380
You're dead wrong,
smartypants.

242
00:12:01,448 --> 00:12:03,542
The reason I became
an anesthesiologist

243
00:12:03,662 --> 00:12:06,320
is so that I could switch
my specialties whenever I wanted.

244
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,058
Call me in a year
when you're standing

245
00:12:08,178 --> 00:12:09,982
over an empty
operating table

246
00:12:10,102 --> 00:12:13,129
and I'm making bank over
the heart institute at cedars.

247
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,327
Oh, look who's here.
Fancypants, huh?

248
00:12:16,447 --> 00:12:17,964
Oh, you look good.
Maybe too good.

249
00:12:18,031 --> 00:12:19,758
Get an extra hour's sleep?
Is that why you're late?

250
00:12:19,878 --> 00:12:21,666
Yeah, you look like a
different person, huh?

251
00:12:21,786 --> 00:12:23,903
Well, I went to see
Jill Jacobson yesterday.

252
00:12:23,971 --> 00:12:26,005
I sampled from
her injectibles menu.

253
00:12:26,073 --> 00:12:27,505
Why the hell did
you go to her?

254
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,272
We can do anything
she does and better.

255
00:12:29,392 --> 00:12:31,515
Dermatologists specialize in
that kind of treatment,

256
00:12:31,635 --> 00:12:33,379
and frankly, they do
a much better job.

257
00:12:33,447 --> 00:12:35,709
Fine, ok? But when
the stuff wears off,

258
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:37,199
I don't want you
going back to her.

259
00:12:37,319 --> 00:12:38,889
If anybody should be
stabbing you with a needle,

260
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:40,667
it's me and
not the competition.

261
00:12:40,787 --> 00:12:42,528
She's not the
competition anymore.

262
00:12:42,648 --> 00:12:44,423
I hired her this morning.

263
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:46,688
You can't hire anyone
without my approval.

264
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:48,276
Don't worry,
you'll love her.

265
00:12:48,396 --> 00:12:51,057
You're having dinner
with her tomorrow night.

266
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,845
- Christian Troy?
- That's me.

267
00:13:12,965 --> 00:13:15,767
Have a seat. We're running
a little behind today.

268
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:31,282
Hey.

269
00:13:34,997 --> 00:13:36,637
Are they always this busy?

270
00:13:37,073 --> 00:13:37,742
No.

271
00:13:38,261 --> 00:13:40,001
It's usually worse.

272
00:13:41,742 --> 00:13:43,704
So you come here
quite a bit, then?

273
00:13:43,771 --> 00:13:45,133
Every 6 weeks.

274
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,047
That must be awful.

275
00:13:49,167 --> 00:13:50,824
No, it's not so bad.

276
00:13:50,944 --> 00:13:52,430
It's just like
getting a haircut.

277
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,685
I meant wasting
your time and money

278
00:13:53,805 --> 00:13:55,055
on something
that doesn't work.

279
00:13:55,175 --> 00:13:56,160
I beg your pardon?

280
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,271
You do realize that
if you only use injectibles

281
00:13:58,391 --> 00:14:00,045
you'll never be satisfied.

282
00:14:02,371 --> 00:14:05,106
Sure, there's the high of looking
good when you first get it done.

283
00:14:05,226 --> 00:14:06,453
But then you start seeing

284
00:14:06,573 --> 00:14:08,829
the spots the doctor
missed right away.

285
00:14:09,884 --> 00:14:12,194
Like these lines, here.

286
00:14:13,767 --> 00:14:17,045
Of course, the doctor's only
too willing to squeeze you in.

287
00:14:17,165 --> 00:14:18,433
It's more money for her.

288
00:14:18,553 --> 00:14:20,241
Thank you
for seeing me again.

289
00:14:20,361 --> 00:14:21,850
Good to have you back.

290
00:14:22,955 --> 00:14:24,592
Just right here I noticed.

291
00:14:24,712 --> 00:14:25,382
Ok.

292
00:14:25,717 --> 00:14:27,909
You can't argue
with the results, though.

293
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:31,474
If you're looking for real
value and long-lasting results,

294
00:14:31,594 --> 00:14:33,820
the only thing
you can rely on

295
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,105
is a qualified surgeon.

296
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:38,163
Take one.

297
00:14:40,489 --> 00:14:41,326
Great.

298
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:44,004
Thank you.

299
00:14:52,238 --> 00:14:53,292
Lois,

300
00:14:54,407 --> 00:14:55,834
what happened here?

301
00:14:55,954 --> 00:14:57,675
I thought
we were overbooked.

302
00:14:57,795 --> 00:14:59,718
They all got a better offer.

303
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:07,414
How dare you get rid of
my patients like that.

304
00:15:07,534 --> 00:15:09,124
They left of
their own free will.

305
00:15:09,244 --> 00:15:11,062
Only after you Fed them
some bullshit line

306
00:15:11,182 --> 00:15:13,037
about the marvels
of plastic surgery.

307
00:15:13,157 --> 00:15:15,290
Actually, it was
an educated decision

308
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:17,174
based on
years of practice.

309
00:15:17,442 --> 00:15:18,643
Of course,

310
00:15:19,031 --> 00:15:21,510
I didn't do a one-year course
at a community college

311
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,170
to become a beautician.

312
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,094
So,

313
00:15:25,714 --> 00:15:28,659
I'm sure that I missed out
on some of the finer points.

314
00:15:32,224 --> 00:15:33,461
Oh, I get it.

315
00:15:33,897 --> 00:15:36,046
This is some kind of test,

316
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,772
to see what I'm made of before
we start working together?

317
00:15:38,892 --> 00:15:41,470
Oh, we're not working
together, sweet cheeks.

318
00:15:41,955 --> 00:15:44,479
See, my partner needed my
approval for you to come aboard

319
00:15:44,599 --> 00:15:47,241
and I came to tell you
that I don't approve.

320
00:15:47,361 --> 00:15:49,282
Things are really bad,
aren't they?

321
00:15:49,402 --> 00:15:51,191
- Excuse me?
- The business.

322
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:52,781
It must be.

323
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:55,974
Or you wouldn't look
like such shit.

324
00:15:56,676 --> 00:15:58,364
I think you need my help.

325
00:15:58,484 --> 00:16:00,258
I got a better idea.
You come to my office,

326
00:16:00,378 --> 00:16:01,804
and I'll help you fill out
that cleavage of yours.

327
00:16:01,924 --> 00:16:03,226
What are you,
an "a" cup?

328
00:16:03,346 --> 00:16:05,003
Is that a problem for you?

329
00:16:05,388 --> 00:16:08,149
That and your
pancake ass, but, um,

330
00:16:08,795 --> 00:16:10,517
we could fix that, too.

331
00:16:12,701 --> 00:16:13,722
And, uh...

332
00:16:15,886 --> 00:16:17,141
What exactly

333
00:16:18,892 --> 00:16:22,847
would you do
to my ass, Dr. Troy?

334
00:16:23,701 --> 00:16:27,182
Why don't you just give us
a quick look here, huh?

335
00:16:30,847 --> 00:16:31,902
This ass?

336
00:16:33,441 --> 00:16:35,550
There's a lot
I could do with that.

337
00:16:36,923 --> 00:16:39,297
I could definitely
take you up to a "c" cup.

338
00:16:39,417 --> 00:16:41,057
Should we lock the door?

339
00:16:41,177 --> 00:16:43,759
Why, huh?
All your patients are gone.

340
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,637
Actually, there's probably
another 10 out there right now.

341
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:51,725
See, I can book every
15 minutes for 8 hours.

342
00:16:52,814 --> 00:16:55,291
But since you're part
of the old guard...

343
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:58,133
I guess you'll never
get to experience

344
00:16:58,253 --> 00:17:00,074
what I really had
to offer you.

345
00:17:00,194 --> 00:17:01,918
Which was a future.

346
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,935
Tell Sean I said thanks
for the opportunity.

347
00:17:09,316 --> 00:17:10,320
I will.

348
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:13,934
And if you change your
mind about the, uh, "c" cup,

349
00:17:14,054 --> 00:17:15,451
you let me know.

350
00:17:20,678 --> 00:17:21,531
Shit!

351
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:23,841
Just a minute.

352
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,636
Butterfingers.

353
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:34,000
Come on in.
Come in.

354
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:37,243
I'd keep your shoes on.

355
00:17:37,363 --> 00:17:38,746
- Ok.
- Yeah.

356
00:17:40,838 --> 00:17:42,525
It's beautiful here, huh?

357
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:43,833
Oh, thank you.

358
00:17:45,423 --> 00:17:47,278
So, would you like
some wine?

359
00:17:47,398 --> 00:17:49,284
I... I got some white
and some red

360
00:17:49,404 --> 00:17:51,875
that my husband
brought back from Napa.

361
00:17:51,995 --> 00:17:53,760
Uh, he's an expert.

362
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:56,227
I, uh, think he knew
more about wine

363
00:17:56,347 --> 00:17:58,325
than he knew about me.

364
00:17:58,597 --> 00:18:00,672
Oh, God, I didn't even ask
if you drank.

365
00:18:00,792 --> 00:18:03,769
I just... I've heard that most
lesbians are alcoholics.

366
00:18:05,426 --> 00:18:07,969
Well, I must be in
the super minority.

367
00:18:08,446 --> 00:18:09,782
I prefer red.

368
00:18:09,902 --> 00:18:12,500
Me, too.
Isn't that wild?

369
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,590
Yeah.

370
00:18:22,206 --> 00:18:23,149
Can I use this?

371
00:18:23,217 --> 00:18:24,125
Oh God.

372
00:18:24,245 --> 00:18:25,929
God coming
to the rescue.

373
00:18:26,049 --> 00:18:27,145
Oh, good.

374
00:18:29,672 --> 00:18:31,812
Is this your first date
with a woman?

375
00:18:31,932 --> 00:18:33,455
Is it that obvious?

376
00:18:37,198 --> 00:18:40,430
Look, believe me,
I'm not just experimenting.

377
00:18:41,267 --> 00:18:44,065
I'm like 75% sure
that I'm gay.

378
00:18:44,885 --> 00:18:47,294
75%, huh?

379
00:18:49,844 --> 00:18:51,159
I've, um...

380
00:18:52,508 --> 00:18:54,914
I've always been
attracted to women.

381
00:18:55,727 --> 00:18:57,166
And, um...

382
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,648
it leaves the fact that

383
00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:03,376
in all the years
with my husband,

384
00:19:04,925 --> 00:19:07,192
I never once had, uh...

385
00:19:08,212 --> 00:19:09,216
You know.

386
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:13,326
Well, bottoms up.

387
00:19:15,469 --> 00:19:17,365
Oh, shit,
I didn't mean that.

388
00:19:34,084 --> 00:19:35,490
What you doin'?

389
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:39,774
I'm taking care
of the other 25%.

390
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,473
It's...
it's just, um...

391
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,251
I've never...

392
00:20:05,925 --> 00:20:06,846
And...

393
00:20:08,687 --> 00:20:10,963
I just... I don't want you
to expect too much.

394
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:12,700
I don't expect anything.

395
00:20:14,201 --> 00:20:15,043
Ok?

396
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:18,332
I just want you to
have a good time.

397
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,842
 I don't care if you orgasm.

398
00:20:21,572 --> 00:20:23,855
Just trust me.
It's gonna be ok.

399
00:20:24,501 --> 00:20:25,612
All right?

400
00:20:26,633 --> 00:20:27,302
Ok.

401
00:20:30,381 --> 00:20:31,653
I trust you.

402
00:20:55,737 --> 00:20:57,776
Sean, you might want to call
your little injectibles wench

403
00:20:57,896 --> 00:20:59,600
and tell her she won't be
having a job here.

404
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,458
I'm not budging
on that one, by the way,

405
00:21:01,578 --> 00:21:03,457
so don't tax you're
already overworked brain

406
00:21:03,577 --> 00:21:06,249
trying to come up with
a way to talk me out of it.

407
00:21:06,369 --> 00:21:09,113
Yeah, I think we're on
the same page about that.

408
00:21:09,816 --> 00:21:12,242
- What happened to you?
- Too much filler.

409
00:21:12,511 --> 00:21:14,511
- You went back a second time?
- And a third.

410
00:21:14,631 --> 00:21:17,057
- A third?
- Yeah, laugh away, pal.

411
00:21:17,177 --> 00:21:19,711
You're gonna be
doing the correction.

412
00:21:19,831 --> 00:21:22,965
5cc of hyaluronidase
wherever she injected me.

413
00:21:23,085 --> 00:21:24,290
So, fellas,

414
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:27,234
I just got off the phone
with a Bernie Greenstein,

415
00:21:27,354 --> 00:21:29,677
who said that he's
representing the ayers,

416
00:21:29,797 --> 00:21:31,912
and they are filing
a lawsuit against us,

417
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,663
claiming loss
of income

418
00:21:33,783 --> 00:21:36,324
due to misrepresentation
and malpractice.

419
00:21:36,843 --> 00:21:38,481
Oh, my God,
look at you.

420
00:21:38,601 --> 00:21:40,572
- Who'd you piss off?
- Don't.

421
00:21:41,191 --> 00:21:42,848
Well, he's trying to get
a court order

422
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,651
to see a list
of our patients,

423
00:21:44,718 --> 00:21:46,325
hoping that there are
more disgruntled folks.

424
00:21:46,445 --> 00:21:48,587
Bernie greendick is
an asshole. Ok?

425
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:51,270
And everything he touches
turns to tabloid, uh,

426
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:52,906
headlines, ok?
So who gives a shit?

427
00:21:53,026 --> 00:21:55,560
All right, could we put the lawsuit
aside and bring the swelling down?

428
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,411
 Please?

429
00:21:56,531 --> 00:21:58,560
You're wrong, Sean.
We have plenty to worry about.

430
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,347
All people need to do is hear
the name McNamara and Troy

431
00:22:01,467 --> 00:22:03,978
in context with a lawsuit
and we're screwed.

432
00:22:06,471 --> 00:22:08,233
No, no, no, we can't
worry about that.

433
00:22:08,353 --> 00:22:09,656
There's nothing
we can do.

434
00:22:09,776 --> 00:22:11,085
It's all over, anyway.

435
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:13,748
The whole pursuit of
perfection is a gigantic hoax.

436
00:22:13,868 --> 00:22:14,991
Nothing changes.

437
00:22:15,111 --> 00:22:16,718
We need to put up
a fight, all right?

438
00:22:16,838 --> 00:22:19,319
I'm gonna get a feather lift and
you're gonna give it to me,

439
00:22:19,386 --> 00:22:22,135
and you're gonna show
the world what we do here.

440
00:22:23,072 --> 00:22:24,294
And that would do what,

441
00:22:24,414 --> 00:22:26,219
besides take you out
of surgery for a week?

442
00:22:26,339 --> 00:22:28,157
You'll be the poster boy
for injectibles, ok?

443
00:22:28,277 --> 00:22:30,041
I'll be the face
of the business

444
00:22:30,161 --> 00:22:32,277
and the future
of plastic surgery.

445
00:22:42,386 --> 00:22:43,926
All right, old man.

446
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:46,520
You sure you're
ready to do this?

447
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,042
Hold on.
I didn't get that.

448
00:22:48,162 --> 00:22:48,946
Wait.

449
00:22:49,709 --> 00:22:51,654
Can you say your line
again for me, please?

450
00:22:51,722 --> 00:22:52,855
What are you doing?

451
00:22:52,923 --> 00:22:54,256
It's ok.
She's filming this.

452
00:22:54,324 --> 00:22:56,992
I asked her to. We're gonna
put the whole thing on Youtube.

453
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,194
The surgery?

454
00:22:58,261 --> 00:22:59,702
Yes.
It's pioneering,

455
00:22:59,822 --> 00:23:01,330
just like we used to be.

456
00:23:01,398 --> 00:23:03,085
Any luck, this whole
thing will go viral

457
00:23:03,205 --> 00:23:05,134
and the world will get
to see just how easy

458
00:23:05,254 --> 00:23:07,078
a facelift
can be these days.

459
00:23:07,397 --> 00:23:08,817
Oh, yeah,
that'll work.

460
00:23:08,937 --> 00:23:10,694
We get a half a million hits,
you wait...

461
00:23:10,814 --> 00:23:12,217
we'll go from being sued

462
00:23:12,337 --> 00:23:13,819
to being stars again.

463
00:23:14,605 --> 00:23:15,559
I know

464
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,852
it makes you a little
anxious to be on camera.

465
00:23:17,972 --> 00:23:20,616
As a tv star guy.
So just pretend it's not there.

466
00:23:20,684 --> 00:23:21,617
Ok?

467
00:23:21,685 --> 00:23:22,618
Ok.

468
00:23:22,686 --> 00:23:24,901
Ok. Now say your line again.
And do it good.

469
00:23:25,021 --> 00:23:28,161
Uh... are you sure
you're ready to do this?

470
00:23:29,065 --> 00:23:31,226
Absolu... absolutely, doc.

471
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:33,301
Let's operate.

472
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:34,607
Music.

473
00:23:41,204 --> 00:23:42,280
Sweet dreams.

474
00:23:42,648 --> 00:23:43,703
All right...

475
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:47,382
10... 9... 8...

476
00:24:12,134 --> 00:24:15,571
Can you feel it? I mean, the
energy is just electrifying.

477
00:24:15,639 --> 00:24:18,440
And just think, in a few minutes
we'll be at the end of an era,

478
00:24:18,508 --> 00:24:20,142
and everybody
who is anybody

479
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:22,279
who no longer looks
the way they used to

480
00:24:22,399 --> 00:24:23,694
will be here tonight.

481
00:24:23,814 --> 00:24:27,492
Speaking of that, look who is here.
It's Dr. Sean McNamara.

482
00:24:27,612 --> 00:24:28,398
Sean!

483
00:24:28,518 --> 00:24:30,553
Don't you look dashing.

484
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,816
Well, Joan, when they told me
that we'd be celebrating

485
00:24:32,936 --> 00:24:34,638
the demise of
plastic surgery tonight,

486
00:24:34,758 --> 00:24:36,964
I knew I couldn't
show up in scrubs.

487
00:24:37,084 --> 00:24:38,327
And this is your date?

488
00:24:38,395 --> 00:24:40,296
Yes. This is
my new partner Curtis.

489
00:24:40,363 --> 00:24:41,797
Oh. I love your outfit.

490
00:24:41,865 --> 00:24:43,799
Well, thank you. My daughter
actually picked it out.

491
00:24:43,867 --> 00:24:45,301
Oh, hello.
Don't tell me.

492
00:24:45,368 --> 00:24:48,488
Valentino, right?
Crocodile collection?

493
00:24:48,608 --> 00:24:51,544
I have the same thing
in my closet.

494
00:24:51,664 --> 00:24:54,858
Well, we should get going.
We're already late as it is.

495
00:24:54,978 --> 00:24:56,079
Sean, wait!

496
00:24:58,992 --> 00:25:00,481
Ah! Look who's here...

497
00:25:00,601 --> 00:25:02,721
the one man who
single-handedly destroyed

498
00:25:02,841 --> 00:25:04,646
the fine art
of plastic surgery,

499
00:25:04,766 --> 00:25:06,205
Dr. Christian Troy.

500
00:25:06,325 --> 00:25:08,424
So what are you doing, doc,
trying to crash the party?

501
00:25:08,491 --> 00:25:09,291
No, I have to stop...

502
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:11,608
If anyone needs to be stopped,
doctor, I think it's you.

503
00:25:11,728 --> 00:25:13,662
Maybe you'll learn
from the lawsuit, huh?

504
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:15,309
What do you think
about that?

505
00:25:15,429 --> 00:25:17,602
Hey, doc!
What are you wearing?

506
00:25:20,237 --> 00:25:22,589
Oh. Yeah,
I got him right here.

507
00:25:25,976 --> 00:25:27,373
Oh, sir.
I'm sorry.

508
00:25:27,493 --> 00:25:29,499
This is a private party.
You can't come in.

509
00:25:29,619 --> 00:25:31,462
Your name,
it's not even on the list.

510
00:25:31,582 --> 00:25:33,143
Please step back.

511
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:41,930
Sean! Wait!

512
00:25:45,109 --> 00:25:47,201
Wait! Wait!

513
00:25:55,338 --> 00:25:57,907
Such a pretty pig,
isn't he?

514
00:25:57,974 --> 00:25:59,134
Very pretty.

515
00:26:00,343 --> 00:26:02,461
But do you think
he's done?

516
00:26:02,581 --> 00:26:04,647
Only one way to find out.

517
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:12,988
A little overdone,
I'd say.

518
00:26:13,056 --> 00:26:17,059
Ladies, I am so sorry that
you don't like your meal.

519
00:26:17,127 --> 00:26:19,962
But he just refused to
let me tenderize him first.

520
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:22,003
Look... heh heh...
we're starving.

521
00:26:22,123 --> 00:26:24,865
Now, there has to be
something that we can do.

522
00:26:25,735 --> 00:26:27,670
Let's ask the man
himself, shall we?

523
00:26:27,737 --> 00:26:28,832
Good idea.

524
00:26:30,807 --> 00:26:33,837
Tell us what you don't
like about yourself.

525
00:26:34,544 --> 00:26:35,644
Everything.

526
00:26:35,712 --> 00:26:37,486
How can you say that?

527
00:26:40,415 --> 00:26:42,473
- Look at me.
- Look at me.

528
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:46,418
I'm on the wrong
side of 40. I got a...

529
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:50,369
fake tit from a
one-in-a-million cancer.

530
00:26:51,674 --> 00:26:54,118
I can't lose the pounds
like I used to.

531
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:56,066
My hair keeps falling out.

532
00:26:56,186 --> 00:26:58,011
My entire livelihood
is becoming

533
00:26:58,131 --> 00:26:59,895
the enron
of surgical procedures.

534
00:27:00,015 --> 00:27:02,021
And now my
closest friend, my...

535
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,201
Biggest supporter
is leaving me.

536
00:27:05,976 --> 00:27:07,643
Oh, quit being so negative.

537
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:09,317
You sound like Sean.

538
00:27:10,097 --> 00:27:12,099
When you show no fear,
you project confidence

539
00:27:12,219 --> 00:27:14,817
and your life will always
have the appearance

540
00:27:15,112 --> 00:27:16,458
of success.

541
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:19,504
And image is everything.

542
00:27:20,623 --> 00:27:21,797
Is it not?

543
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:27,721
So...

544
00:27:28,718 --> 00:27:30,747
what can you do
for me, then?

545
00:27:30,867 --> 00:27:32,976
Have you thought
about injectibles?

546
00:27:33,712 --> 00:27:35,938
They really are the future.

547
00:27:38,014 --> 00:27:39,637
This is bullshit.

548
00:27:44,457 --> 00:27:47,168
I'll get Sean
to do the surgery.

549
00:27:47,717 --> 00:27:49,451
Thanks so much for doing this.

550
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:50,886
Are you kidding?

551
00:27:50,954 --> 00:27:54,072
I've been waiting 20 years
to highlight all your flaws.

552
00:27:55,211 --> 00:27:56,717
Why, do I have a lot?

553
00:27:57,621 --> 00:27:58,424
Well,

554
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:02,036
for starters, you're
pompous, self-centered,

555
00:28:02,156 --> 00:28:04,280
almost sociopathic
in your complete disregard

556
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,362
for anyone besides yourself.

557
00:28:06,482 --> 00:28:08,979
You have almost no talent
in the operating room.

558
00:28:09,099 --> 00:28:11,633
But you've managed
to make an entire career

559
00:28:11,753 --> 00:28:13,835
riding on my coattails,
all the while insisting

560
00:28:13,955 --> 00:28:16,211
that you're the one
who is the real star.

561
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:18,555
For the longest time
I actually admired you

562
00:28:18,675 --> 00:28:21,166
for how easily life seemed
to bend to your will,

563
00:28:21,286 --> 00:28:23,141
how women fell
at your feet.

564
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:25,752
And then I grew to hate you
for how careless

565
00:28:25,872 --> 00:28:27,523
and single-minded
you could be.

566
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:29,541
Now I just think it's sad,

567
00:28:29,661 --> 00:28:32,156
because for someone
who's so desperate

568
00:28:32,276 --> 00:28:34,720
to succeed and
get recognition,

569
00:28:35,138 --> 00:28:37,381
I see just how lonely
you really are.

570
00:28:37,733 --> 00:28:39,196
When I'm gone,

571
00:28:39,316 --> 00:28:41,958
you'll have no one
left in your life

572
00:28:42,078 --> 00:28:43,641
who cares for you.

573
00:28:43,976 --> 00:28:44,779
And...

574
00:28:46,871 --> 00:28:48,394
You will die alone.

575
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,800
Am I really this ugly?

576
00:29:15,472 --> 00:29:17,239
Don't be upset.

577
00:29:17,307 --> 00:29:20,093
Let your shortcomings and
your flaws fuel you.

578
00:29:20,213 --> 00:29:21,606
Let them push you further

579
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:23,504
than you ever
thought you could go.

580
00:29:23,624 --> 00:29:26,075
When you stop
striving for perfection,

581
00:29:26,195 --> 00:29:28,812
you might as well
be dead, buddy boy.

582
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:58,280
I'm so sorry
about what happened.

583
00:29:58,348 --> 00:30:00,415
Don't be.
I'm not dead.

584
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:04,948
I have so much silicone in me,
I stayed afloat for days.

585
00:30:05,822 --> 00:30:08,245
Don't worry about it.
It's ok.

586
00:30:08,964 --> 00:30:09,868
Come on.

587
00:30:10,229 --> 00:30:12,394
I've had
a really long day.

588
00:30:26,621 --> 00:30:28,277
I missed you so much.

589
00:30:28,344 --> 00:30:29,483
Prove it.

590
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,906
You couldn't save me, honey.

591
00:30:44,429 --> 00:30:46,487
Nobody could.

592
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,304
Goodbye, Christian.

593
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,468
Don't worry,

594
00:31:06,506 --> 00:31:07,950
I'll never leave you.

595
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:09,434
Who are you?

596
00:31:13,334 --> 00:31:15,577
You don't see
the family resemblance?

597
00:31:17,518 --> 00:31:18,389
Come

598
00:31:19,242 --> 00:31:20,464
give your dad a hug.

599
00:31:20,584 --> 00:31:22,037
Get out of my house.

600
00:31:23,309 --> 00:31:25,585
You're not my father,
you're a monster.

601
00:31:32,095 --> 00:31:34,472
You can try and deny
where you came from

602
00:31:34,857 --> 00:31:36,396
as much as you want,

603
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:41,669
but you'll always be
daddy's little boy.

604
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:55,093
Are you trying
to rearrange my face,

605
00:31:55,444 --> 00:31:57,168
just like you're
doing to your own

606
00:31:57,288 --> 00:31:59,410
on the surgery table
right now?

607
00:32:06,506 --> 00:32:09,234
Stop fighting
who you are.

608
00:32:10,791 --> 00:32:13,067
My darkness is
a part of you.

609
00:32:13,616 --> 00:32:15,752
You have my DNA,
Christian.

610
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,302
You have my DNA.

611
00:32:20,516 --> 00:32:22,407
Although I have
to admit, you did

612
00:32:22,527 --> 00:32:24,884
a lot of the heavy lifting
on your own.

613
00:32:26,591 --> 00:32:29,085
Stop.
Sean, please,

614
00:32:30,099 --> 00:32:31,366
don't hurt me.

615
00:32:31,962 --> 00:32:34,874
Oh, it'll be over
before you know it.

616
00:32:42,439 --> 00:32:43,694
Did you know

617
00:32:44,273 --> 00:32:47,031
that getting a facelift is
the physiological equivalent

618
00:32:47,151 --> 00:32:49,432
of going through a windshield
at 60 miles an hour?

619
00:32:49,552 --> 00:32:51,453
Please, don't.
Please.

620
00:32:56,902 --> 00:32:58,388
I can bring him out now.

621
00:32:58,508 --> 00:32:59,630
We're done.

622
00:33:00,534 --> 00:33:02,090
Turn that thing off.

623
00:33:12,065 --> 00:33:15,597
Never let me give a patient
a hard time about pain again.

624
00:33:17,187 --> 00:33:20,534
You know, under normal
circumstances, I'd rub it in.

625
00:33:21,069 --> 00:33:23,737
But because you did it
for the business,

626
00:33:23,857 --> 00:33:26,056
I'm gonna increase
your morphine regime

627
00:33:26,176 --> 00:33:27,563
 and say thank you.

628
00:33:35,412 --> 00:33:36,835
What do you think?

629
00:33:37,203 --> 00:33:39,446
I thought you
looked good already.

630
00:33:45,451 --> 00:33:47,335
You didn't do this
because of a lawsuit

631
00:33:47,455 --> 00:33:49,243
or because you took
one for the team.

632
00:33:49,363 --> 00:33:52,222
You did it because
you wanted a facelift.

633
00:33:58,599 --> 00:34:00,473
I noticed it
while I was shaving

634
00:34:00,593 --> 00:34:02,114
a couple of months ago.

635
00:34:03,402 --> 00:34:05,937
Nothing anybody else would
see, but I do this for a living.

636
00:34:06,004 --> 00:34:08,105
Everyone gets older,
Christian.

637
00:34:08,225 --> 00:34:10,833
You know, and you're
one of those lucky ones.

638
00:34:10,953 --> 00:34:13,109
You're only gonna
get better looking.

639
00:34:14,565 --> 00:34:17,477
You know why I have
relationships that never last?

640
00:34:18,183 --> 00:34:20,687
Or why I trade in my car
every 6 months?

641
00:34:20,807 --> 00:34:21,784
A.d.d.?

642
00:34:22,118 --> 00:34:23,641
A complete
lack of a soul?

643
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:24,445
No.

644
00:34:26,035 --> 00:34:27,390
I hate change.

645
00:34:28,963 --> 00:34:30,251
Terrified by it.

646
00:34:31,741 --> 00:34:34,168
I don't like it
when things end.

647
00:34:35,608 --> 00:34:37,764
I like to end them
myself,

648
00:34:37,884 --> 00:34:39,139
on my own terms.

649
00:34:39,259 --> 00:34:41,005
It keeps you from
getting hurt, huh?

650
00:34:41,073 --> 00:34:42,671
It also keeps me alone.

651
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,884
I just can't accept it
when things are over.

652
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,800
When things are perfect,

653
00:34:50,804 --> 00:34:53,167
- you know.
- Life is not perfect.

654
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,380
Life is messy.

655
00:34:57,143 --> 00:34:59,560
Sometimes life
is very messy.

656
00:35:00,659 --> 00:35:03,619
- We still talking about me?
- I'm talking about life.

657
00:35:03,739 --> 00:35:06,149
You know, and wanting
things to be perfect

658
00:35:06,269 --> 00:35:09,529
and getting disappointed
over and over and over

659
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,418
because
it's never gonna be.

660
00:35:11,538 --> 00:35:12,834
Then what happens?

661
00:35:12,954 --> 00:35:14,486
You end up being alone.

662
00:35:14,606 --> 00:35:15,662
Depressing.

663
00:35:17,972 --> 00:35:19,579
I slept with Daniella.

664
00:35:20,299 --> 00:35:21,490
She's great.

665
00:35:21,842 --> 00:35:23,549
Ok.
She's absolutely great

666
00:35:23,669 --> 00:35:26,227
and she's gorgeous
and she's funny and...

667
00:35:26,347 --> 00:35:27,450
gorgeous.

668
00:35:27,919 --> 00:35:30,095
You know,
I think, ok,

669
00:35:30,362 --> 00:35:33,258
I've waited and
this is my reward, right?

670
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,956
We were making love
and, uh,

671
00:35:37,977 --> 00:35:40,974
she's having this
orgasm that's just...

672
00:35:43,634 --> 00:35:47,735
I know.
And then she, uh...

673
00:35:50,175 --> 00:35:51,142
She what?

674
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:52,810
I can't even say it.
I can't say it.

675
00:35:52,878 --> 00:35:53,840
Ejaculated?

676
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,012
Like a fire hose.

677
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,191
- Are you serious?
- I almost drowned.

678
00:35:57,311 --> 00:35:59,392
- It's not funny.
- It's pretty funny.

679
00:35:59,512 --> 00:36:01,052
I mean,
I told her, I said,

680
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,388
"It's ok. I don't mind it,
I think of it as a compliment."

681
00:36:05,001 --> 00:36:06,206
But the truth is...

682
00:36:06,326 --> 00:36:08,466
the truth is
you're just like me.

683
00:36:10,156 --> 00:36:12,030
You want life
to be easy

684
00:36:12,927 --> 00:36:14,156
and clean.

685
00:36:16,415 --> 00:36:18,189
That's a damn shame.

686
00:36:22,825 --> 00:36:25,218
- Who is it?
- It's me, Liz.

687
00:36:30,992 --> 00:36:32,180
Can I come in?

688
00:36:33,134 --> 00:36:34,473
I don't think so.

689
00:36:34,758 --> 00:36:35,762
Please?

690
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:49,185
Look,

691
00:36:50,383 --> 00:36:52,437
I know I didn't call you,

692
00:36:52,557 --> 00:36:53,862
and it's only because...

693
00:36:53,982 --> 00:36:55,449
you were repulsed
and disgusted.

694
00:36:55,569 --> 00:36:56,272
No.

695
00:36:58,012 --> 00:36:58,916
Shocked.

696
00:36:59,602 --> 00:37:00,539
Thanks.

697
00:37:01,626 --> 00:37:03,133
Only because

698
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,877
it was unexpected.

699
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:11,216
And it freaked me out,
and I got scared.

700
00:37:12,036 --> 00:37:13,409
It's not you.

701
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:18,680
I thought that women
who could, you know,

702
00:37:19,115 --> 00:37:20,217
you know...

703
00:37:20,337 --> 00:37:22,232
- Squirt.
- Yeah, squirt.

704
00:37:22,928 --> 00:37:24,926
I thought they
only existed in...

705
00:37:25,295 --> 00:37:26,600
lesbian porn.

706
00:37:27,654 --> 00:37:29,830
But you are so real.

707
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:34,735
And I don't want
to give up on someone

708
00:37:36,441 --> 00:37:38,500
who I feel so
connected to

709
00:37:39,045 --> 00:37:40,943
because of my ignorance.

710
00:37:41,731 --> 00:37:43,689
You are wonderful.

711
00:37:44,158 --> 00:37:46,116
And I am so sorry.

712
00:37:47,722 --> 00:37:49,535
Hey, hon.
Who is it?

713
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:54,328
Um, it's
Dr. Elizabeth Cruz

714
00:37:54,448 --> 00:37:57,001
from McNamara/Troy.
She's a client of mine,

715
00:37:57,069 --> 00:37:59,627
and we discovered that
we're neighbors, so...

716
00:37:59,747 --> 00:38:02,217
I told her that if there was
any sample she wanted,

717
00:38:02,337 --> 00:38:04,513
she could just...
she could stop by.

718
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:07,372
This is my husband Edward.

719
00:38:07,492 --> 00:38:09,213
Hi. Nice to meet you,
Dr. Cruz.

720
00:38:09,281 --> 00:38:10,333
Nice to meet you.

721
00:38:10,453 --> 00:38:12,143
Whatever
she's selling,

722
00:38:12,521 --> 00:38:14,151
can't go wrong.

723
00:38:14,219 --> 00:38:15,156
Right.

724
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,034
How about
I walk you out?

725
00:38:18,154 --> 00:38:18,954
Sure.

726
00:38:19,925 --> 00:38:21,206
I'll be right back,
sweetie.

727
00:38:21,326 --> 00:38:22,352
Ok, sure.

728
00:38:38,076 --> 00:38:40,545
Are you going back
to your husband?

729
00:38:41,313 --> 00:38:43,206
I can't do it, Liz.
I can't.

730
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,599
I can't be gay.

731
00:38:47,389 --> 00:38:48,594
You are gay.

732
00:38:50,419 --> 00:38:51,289
Maybe.

733
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,047
But...

734
00:38:54,637 --> 00:38:56,813
at least with him
I'm normal.

735
00:38:58,152 --> 00:39:00,461
I don't do that.

736
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,574
You're gonna miss out
on a lot of joy.

737
00:39:04,813 --> 00:39:07,390
Being like that
doesn't bring me joy.

738
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,908
It's just not how
I see myself. It's just not...

739
00:39:13,682 --> 00:39:15,758
not how I want
to see myself.

740
00:39:18,917 --> 00:39:20,612
I'm...
I'm so sorry.

741
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,252
Me, too.

742
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:44,379
That's the kind of call
you like to get from your lawyer.

743
00:39:44,499 --> 00:39:46,187
I told you the Ayers
didn't have a case.

744
00:39:46,307 --> 00:39:48,161
The only thing they had is
balls for trying to sue us

745
00:39:48,281 --> 00:39:49,213
in the first place.

746
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:52,631
Too bad. They could have gotten
a feather lift for half off instead.

747
00:39:52,751 --> 00:39:55,750
You know, I think you getting
that surgery helped our case.

748
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:59,392
So you're saying that that inflated
ego of mine could have

749
00:39:59,512 --> 00:40:01,075
helped us for a change?

750
00:40:01,945 --> 00:40:02,989
I'm just saying

751
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:05,540
you really put your money
where your mouth was.

752
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:06,846
 I admire that.

753
00:40:06,966 --> 00:40:07,798
Good.

754
00:40:07,918 --> 00:40:09,995
To our continued success.

755
00:40:10,313 --> 00:40:12,122
- Cheers.
- Yes, cheers.

756
00:40:14,465 --> 00:40:16,373
You're not drinking?
It's bad luck.

757
00:40:16,441 --> 00:40:18,147
No, no, no.
I'm still recovering.

758
00:40:18,267 --> 00:40:19,382
You know,
I don't want to

759
00:40:19,502 --> 00:40:21,236
get all swelled up,
look like I came

760
00:40:21,356 --> 00:40:23,128
from Jill Jacobson's office.

761
00:40:23,746 --> 00:40:25,282
That wouldn't be good.

762
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:27,569
Hey, fellas,
have you seen this?

763
00:40:27,689 --> 00:40:30,756
Your surgery is one of the
featured videos on Youtube.

764
00:40:30,876 --> 00:40:32,144
You're kidding.

765
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:34,919
It's already a quarter
of a million hits.

766
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:36,994
Oh, look,
it's over 300,000 now.

767
00:40:37,062 --> 00:40:39,063
See that?
I told you it would be a hit.

768
00:40:39,131 --> 00:40:40,617
Oh, yeah.
Look at that.

769
00:40:40,737 --> 00:40:42,500
Over 40,000 comments.

770
00:40:42,567 --> 00:40:44,677
I think people are trying
to get in contact with us.

771
00:40:44,797 --> 00:40:47,098
Is there anyway we can get our
phone number on this website?

772
00:40:47,218 --> 00:40:48,219
This is like free advertising.

773
00:40:48,339 --> 00:40:50,277
I told you that lawsuit
would be the best thing

774
00:40:50,397 --> 00:40:52,085
that happened
to this business.

775
00:40:53,757 --> 00:40:54,996
Oh, you know,

776
00:40:55,364 --> 00:40:57,707
I'm not sure everybody
else is as enthused

777
00:40:57,827 --> 00:40:59,798
about this as you are.

778
00:40:59,918 --> 00:41:02,728
"What a barbaric thing
to do to someone."

779
00:41:02,848 --> 00:41:04,352
"Does anyone really think

780
00:41:04,472 --> 00:41:06,193
plastic surgery
makes sense anymore?"

781
00:41:06,313 --> 00:41:09,473
"This is disgusting."
"Facelifts are so 2004."

782
00:41:09,757 --> 00:41:11,715
Oh, come on.
It can't be all of them.

783
00:41:11,835 --> 00:41:13,255
Give me this thing.

784
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:27,026
Maybe I need to post
a follow-up

785
00:41:27,146 --> 00:41:28,836
now that I'm fully healed.

786
00:41:29,372 --> 00:41:31,045
What do you guys think?

787
00:41:53,021 --> 00:41:56,971
