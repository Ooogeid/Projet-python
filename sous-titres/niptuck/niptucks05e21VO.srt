00:00:00,889 --> 00:00:02,209
<I>Previously on </I>Nip/Tuck.

2
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:03,461
Mrs. Caldarello,

3
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:06,881
we've had tremendous success
in lip reconstruction

4
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:09,008
using the patient's labial folds.

5
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:11,485
What about
when my husband kisses me?

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,721
If he finds out,
he'll never kiss me again.

7
00:00:14,962 --> 00:00:17,623
What about the secret joy
of knowing that it's the first time

8
00:00:17,748 --> 00:00:19,717
those lips will have
ever been kissed?

9
00:00:19,842 --> 00:00:20,561
Do it.

10
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:22,827
Put my pussy on my lips.

11
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,239
If I may ask, Theodora.

12
00:00:25,673 --> 00:00:26,651
Call me Teddy.

13
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:28,944
Why do I  feel
like you're interviewing me?

14
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:29,904
I am.

15
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:32,160
Anything else you find interesting?

16
00:00:33,045 --> 00:00:35,900
The tumor has spread to the
supraclavicular lymph nodes.

17
00:00:36,113 --> 00:00:37,828
- Give me a ballpark.
- 6 months.

18
00:00:39,524 --> 00:00:41,066
I want you to marry me.

19
00:01:08,641 --> 00:01:10,414
How does it look? Any moths?

20
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,072
Give me a minute.
Just to try it on.

21
00:01:14,861 --> 00:01:16,325
Everything all right, bizzy?

22
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:19,336
It's been in storage since the day
your father and I got married.

23
00:01:19,461 --> 00:01:20,624
No, it's fine.

24
00:01:20,749 --> 00:01:22,523
I just need a little privacy.

25
00:01:22,648 --> 00:01:23,440
Please.

26
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:27,708
Sure.

27
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,347
Bizzy. That's what you call her?

28
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:38,514
Since she was 2 years old,
she was always getting into things.

29
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:40,476
Rearranging her room,

30
00:01:41,358 --> 00:01:44,854
sorting out the silverware.
Very industrious little girl.

31
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:47,648
I encouraged her. I told her,
you put your mind to it,

32
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,608
work hard, you're gonna get
whatever you want in life.

33
00:01:51,241 --> 00:01:54,155
Because let's face it. She was not
going to get anywhere on her looks.

34
00:01:58,413 --> 00:02:00,911
Could I get you a drink,
Mariela? Soda, water?

35
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,205
Please. And call me "Ma".

36
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:06,959
Patron doble.

37
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,462
Because we are celebrating,
aren't we?

38
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,666
My daughter is getting married.

39
00:02:11,862 --> 00:02:14,884
- And to a man of all things.
- Yeah, well, nobody's perfect.

40
00:02:16,585 --> 00:02:18,053
Pretty close.

41
00:02:21,131 --> 00:02:23,642
So why are you marrying my daughter?

42
00:02:25,251 --> 00:02:26,277
The sex.

43
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,903
The last time I visited,
she was a flannel-shirt wearing lesbiana

44
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:36,153
who was having
trouble getting a date.

45
00:02:38,206 --> 00:02:39,872
What is the real story here?

46
00:02:48,975 --> 00:02:52,755
The real story is
I should be toasting you

47
00:02:53,681 --> 00:02:55,424
for giving me
such a beautiful woman.

48
00:02:56,705 --> 00:02:57,621
To family.

49
00:03:00,557 --> 00:03:01,640
So you're gay?

50
00:03:02,545 --> 00:03:04,683
This is an arrangement
between you types?

51
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:07,646
You get insurance now or something.

52
00:03:09,858 --> 00:03:11,565
Can you come in here, please?

53
00:03:16,359 --> 00:03:19,693
Can you please...
could you help zip this for me?

54
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,835
You're gonna have
to let this out a little.

55
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,625
Oh, no, I can't. This is an antique.
It's an "as is" kind of thing.

56
00:03:30,042 --> 00:03:31,441
This is not gonna work.

57
00:03:31,566 --> 00:03:35,436
So, why don't we just buy you another
dress and we can start it on tradition?

58
00:03:36,968 --> 00:03:38,509
No. You don't understand.

59
00:03:38,971 --> 00:03:40,446
Ever since I could remember,

60
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:43,447
my mom has wanted me to wear
this dress in my wedding.

61
00:03:43,572 --> 00:03:46,873
And then I came out to her, and neither
of us thought this would ever happen.

62
00:03:46,998 --> 00:03:48,508
A traditional wedding?

63
00:03:48,633 --> 00:03:49,702
In a church?

64
00:03:50,268 --> 00:03:51,586
In my mom's dress?

65
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:54,485
This means everything to me now.

66
00:03:59,789 --> 00:04:02,825
- Sure that's what this is about?
- Bizzy.

67
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:04,412
You know very well,

68
00:04:04,537 --> 00:04:08,334
it is bad luck for the groom to see you
dressed like that before the wedding.

69
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:10,749
Ma! The dress doesn't fit!

70
00:04:11,414 --> 00:04:15,211
Ay, mira. It's those tas of yours.

71
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:17,298
You've always been top-heavy.

72
00:04:18,995 --> 00:04:21,285
Ladies, I think
we're going gown shopping.

73
00:04:22,707 --> 00:04:23,431
No.

74
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,623
If I can't touch the dress,

75
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:29,392
then I'm gonna shrink my chest.

76
00:04:31,463 --> 00:04:32,715
I wanted it before,

77
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,040
now I have to.

78
00:04:38,492 --> 00:04:40,195
Book me for a breast reduction.

79
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,634
Well, this is quite a surprise.

80
00:05:37,961 --> 00:05:39,128
It certainly is.

81
00:05:40,546 --> 00:05:43,244
Tell us what you don't like
about yourself now, mrs. Caldarello.

82
00:05:43,369 --> 00:05:46,744
Her tits, her ass,
that turkey waddle under her chin,

83
00:05:47,054 --> 00:05:49,723
and maybe you could lighten
the luggage under her eyes.

84
00:05:49,987 --> 00:05:53,052
I guess the only thing
you don't have to do are my lips.

85
00:05:53,763 --> 00:05:55,229
Not those beauties.

86
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,470
You did such a bang-up job
on them, doctors.

87
00:05:58,595 --> 00:06:00,526
That's why we flew
all the way out here.

88
00:06:01,055 --> 00:06:04,091
That's very flattering, Mrs. Caldarello.

89
00:06:05,299 --> 00:06:07,439
You never struck me
as the makeover type.

90
00:06:07,564 --> 00:06:10,744
We could barely talk you into repairing
the damage from your oven?

91
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,447
It's nice work if I do say myself.
You could never tell

92
00:06:13,572 --> 00:06:16,011
- that the skin came from your...
- Breasts.

93
00:06:17,765 --> 00:06:18,615
Never.

94
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,108
Ordinarily it would be
fine for Allegra here

95
00:06:21,233 --> 00:06:23,527
to let gravity take its course,

96
00:06:23,652 --> 00:06:26,301
but she's gotta go
back in the market.

97
00:06:26,662 --> 00:06:28,235
I've got prostate cancer.

98
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,972
The doctors aren't optimistic.

99
00:06:38,218 --> 00:06:39,624
I always figured

100
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:43,110
by the time I kicked, she'd be set,

101
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:46,395
- financially speaking.
- I'll be fine, Manny.

102
00:06:47,153 --> 00:06:48,615
I can get a job.

103
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:50,272
With what skills, honey?

104
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:52,989
With a little luck
and a lot of surgery,

105
00:06:53,398 --> 00:06:54,788
she'll find another guy.

106
00:06:55,251 --> 00:06:56,789
Someone who can care for her

107
00:06:56,914 --> 00:06:59,737
in the manner to which she should
have become accustomed.

108
00:07:07,773 --> 00:07:09,261
Oh, those lips...

109
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:13,878
I'm gonna miss them
like nobody's business.

110
00:07:15,764 --> 00:07:17,519
Damn. Where's the head?

111
00:07:18,232 --> 00:07:21,051
All I do is piss these days
'cause of the big "c."

112
00:07:31,874 --> 00:07:32,930
By the way,

113
00:07:34,025 --> 00:07:36,705
I saw you on that tv show you did.

114
00:07:37,663 --> 00:07:40,659
I was quite upset about
that character you based on me.

115
00:07:41,016 --> 00:07:42,356
The one you called...

116
00:07:43,712 --> 00:07:45,547
- I can't even say it.
- Pussylips.

117
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:46,964
That's the one.

118
00:07:47,476 --> 00:07:50,385
And the part about her father
abusing her?

119
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:53,969
- Mrs. Caldarello...
- How did you know?

120
00:07:58,638 --> 00:07:59,424
I am

121
00:07:59,549 --> 00:08:00,427
so sorry

122
00:08:00,942 --> 00:08:03,910
about your husband. I know
how devoted you are to each other.

123
00:08:04,035 --> 00:08:06,486
I can't imagine life without him.

124
00:08:25,249 --> 00:08:26,464
Hey, sadie.

125
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,092
- Sadie?
- Sadie sadie, married lady.

126
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:36,431
Just trying to keep things light since
you look at me like I stole your job,

127
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,975
when you look at me at all.

128
00:08:41,316 --> 00:08:43,970
Let's have a little girl talk,
shall we?

129
00:08:50,798 --> 00:08:52,063
The thing is,

130
00:08:52,456 --> 00:08:55,993
is that I wanna spend as much time
with Christian and Wilber as I can.

131
00:08:56,311 --> 00:08:59,121
But if I stay home 24/7, they
are gonna make me crazy.

132
00:08:59,424 --> 00:09:02,958
So, I think we should split the job.

133
00:09:05,101 --> 00:09:06,490
That's genius.

134
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:09,484
I'm totally OK with that.

135
00:09:10,067 --> 00:09:12,242
Oh, now we can be friends.

136
00:09:12,367 --> 00:09:14,159
It's so much easier.

137
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:18,307
- OK, I just have to ask.
- OK. I know, I know.

138
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:21,476
Now, I am... now, let's see.

139
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,283
I don't take antidepressants,

140
00:09:23,408 --> 00:09:25,414
I have no history of diabetes,

141
00:09:25,909 --> 00:09:29,401
no allergies to any drugs,
no hypertension.

142
00:09:29,878 --> 00:09:32,171
I'm all ready for my surgery,
Mrs. Demille.

143
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:35,145
That's helpful. Thank you.

144
00:09:36,163 --> 00:09:38,869
But what I really want to know
is how it works.

145
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,833
Being one way and then suddenly
switching horses mid-stream.

146
00:09:45,807 --> 00:09:47,168
Isn't that weird?

147
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:50,004
You just loose interest in girls?
I'm just curious.

148
00:09:51,486 --> 00:09:52,466
Bi-curious?

149
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:57,612
I didn't mean to be too personal.

150
00:09:57,737 --> 00:10:00,849
It's just that I havebtrouble keeping
my own wilderbside in check.

151
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,787
Having secrets is difficult,

152
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:07,932
painful. Don't you think?

153
00:10:20,475 --> 00:10:21,576
How's our girl?

154
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:25,210
Her milk bottles are down a quart,
but aside from that, she's doing fine.

155
00:10:25,335 --> 00:10:27,968
I'd say they're only down a pint.
Didn't she ask for a high "C"?

156
00:10:28,093 --> 00:10:30,878
She said she wanted to fit into
her mother's goddamned ugly dress.

157
00:10:31,003 --> 00:10:32,062
A "D" will do.

158
00:10:32,187 --> 00:10:34,345
Didn't this all start
because she had back pain?

159
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,092
We're killing two big-titted birds
with one stone.

160
00:10:37,702 --> 00:10:41,165
Where are you going? Come on,
hang around. This is history right here.

161
00:10:43,483 --> 00:10:44,291
This...

162
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:46,708
my last surgery.

163
00:10:47,616 --> 00:10:50,272
No more lipo on chunky divorcees

164
00:10:51,286 --> 00:10:53,952
or rhinoplasties
on self-hating jewesses.

165
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:55,952
I am free, baby.

166
00:10:56,165 --> 00:10:59,741
I'm taking Lizzy and the kid to Italy.
We're gonna eat like pigs.

167
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,751
Who cares if I get fat, right?

168
00:11:03,104 --> 00:11:04,936
Why do you look at me like that?

169
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,890
Listen, I've had to accept this
and you will, too.

170
00:11:08,015 --> 00:11:10,629
Which is why, I'm gonna start
interviewing replacements.

171
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:12,420
Who says I wanna hire someone new?

172
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:15,085
You think you can keep this train
running on your own?

173
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:19,213
This O.R. is in use 70 hours a week.
I own half of that,

174
00:11:19,338 --> 00:11:24,057
which means that when I'm dead,
that money goes to Lizzy and the kid.

175
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:27,972
I don't want them to miss out because
you're so depressed you can't get real.

176
00:11:33,219 --> 00:11:34,761
They'll be taken care of.

177
00:11:35,632 --> 00:11:36,862
You know that.

178
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,289
Even if I have to pay them
out of my own pocket.

179
00:11:39,414 --> 00:11:43,118
I think it's a little morbid to start
interviewing when you're still healthy.

180
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:46,732
Look, Sean, I'm doing the best I can
to keep it together about all of this.

181
00:11:46,857 --> 00:11:50,195
It's not easy knowing that your
whole life is gonna go on without you.

182
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:55,523
I just wanna know that the guy standing
opposite you in the scrub room every day

183
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,566
is there because I want him to be.

184
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:00,552
I can't replace you, Christian.

185
00:12:02,917 --> 00:12:04,306
Everybody's replaceable.

186
00:12:08,096 --> 00:12:08,929
Even me.

187
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:14,736
Can you, can you call me
when she's coming out?

188
00:12:19,417 --> 00:12:21,490
You're gonna have
to let him go, Sean.

189
00:12:21,998 --> 00:12:23,127
That man is dying

190
00:12:23,252 --> 00:12:26,244
and not in a metaphysical
"we're all dying" kind of way.

191
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,942
He's going to be a ghost
before halloween.

192
00:12:29,657 --> 00:12:32,142
Life is changing.
You can either ride the wave

193
00:12:32,267 --> 00:12:34,336
or get smashed to smithereens
on the rocks.

194
00:12:34,953 --> 00:12:37,171
It's easy for you to say.
He's my brother.

195
00:12:44,495 --> 00:12:47,688
Graduated with honors from UCLA
and trained at Cedars,

196
00:12:47,813 --> 00:12:51,520
distinguished residency at the
Joseph Still Burn Center in Augusta,

197
00:12:52,054 --> 00:12:53,791
guest editor for NJM.

198
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,609
- Credentials speak for you.
- That's encouraging.

199
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,112
If I was looking to hire
a Nobel laureate for surgeon.

200
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:05,455
So my partner and I have been
together for over 20 years.

201
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,493
We've done over 6,000 surgeries,

202
00:13:07,618 --> 00:13:10,288
I was best man at his wedding,
and we have a son together.

203
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,959
We're not looking for somebody
to just come in and play doctor.

204
00:13:14,128 --> 00:13:16,456
It needs to be the right
personality fit as well.

205
00:13:16,581 --> 00:13:17,892
Somebody who's willing to

206
00:13:18,017 --> 00:13:20,632
emotionally invest in the practice
as well as the partnership.

207
00:13:21,824 --> 00:13:24,273
Oh, well, that's definitely not me.

208
00:13:25,088 --> 00:13:27,806
I'm only in this business
for the money and the girls.

209
00:13:29,638 --> 00:13:31,393
- Not married?
- Don't believe in it.

210
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:34,187
- Kids?
- No. But under right circumstances...

211
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:37,612
- What about your dating life?
- Often, but only a 9 or a 10.

212
00:13:37,737 --> 00:13:40,110
- Ever had twins?
- Sisters, but not twins.

213
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:41,951
- Ass man or tits?
- Why choose?

214
00:13:42,076 --> 00:13:43,912
- New York or Vegas?
- New York is Vegas

215
00:13:44,037 --> 00:13:45,323
for anyone with taste.

216
00:13:48,362 --> 00:13:50,412
Well, you have taste.
I'll give you that.

217
00:13:50,585 --> 00:13:52,219
So do you, Dr. Troy.

218
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:55,528
This room, for instance,
impeccable design.

219
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:56,869
This chair,

220
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,467
Milo Baughman.

221
00:13:59,765 --> 00:14:01,757
Distressed celadon velvet.

222
00:14:02,727 --> 00:14:03,973
That couch...

223
00:14:04,628 --> 00:14:06,679
the color, vintage tweed.

224
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:11,084
The whole palette of this room is...
inspired.

225
00:14:12,755 --> 00:14:15,055
I should give you
the number of my designer.

226
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,362
You could kiss her ass instead.

227
00:14:18,574 --> 00:14:21,826
I'm sorry.
I know I get a little carried away.

228
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,546
My mother was in the business.

229
00:14:23,671 --> 00:14:25,595
I grew up around this stuff.

230
00:14:29,515 --> 00:14:32,954
You have a patient. Female. She's coming
for a brow lift. What's your approach?

231
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,207
- How old?
- Early 50's.

232
00:14:35,376 --> 00:14:37,594
I'd push for
an endoscopic brow lift.

233
00:14:37,758 --> 00:14:39,233
Provided you use a laser.

234
00:14:39,358 --> 00:14:41,283
You get nearly the same results.

235
00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:44,544
Patient tells her friends
about her quick recovery, and

236
00:14:44,766 --> 00:14:47,215
that only means
more repeat business.

237
00:14:50,175 --> 00:14:51,705
I don't wanna do this.

238
00:14:51,935 --> 00:14:54,914
Would you rather I hire him first and
then you find out you don't like him?

239
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:57,466
I won't like him no matter
how good he is. He's not you.

240
00:14:57,591 --> 00:15:00,237
No, but he's got the best
credentials by far.

241
00:15:00,362 --> 00:15:02,919
I would think he could be able
to break you out of your...

242
00:15:03,044 --> 00:15:05,709
shelf from time to time, which you're
gonna need when I'm gone.

243
00:15:05,834 --> 00:15:08,358
- Don't say that.
- Let's go back to the wedding, right?

244
00:15:08,483 --> 00:15:10,983
I mean, I need time off
for that first, remember?

245
00:15:11,108 --> 00:15:12,619
Who picked out this table?

246
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,329
This is top of the line.

247
00:15:14,885 --> 00:15:16,733
Double-swivel casters,

248
00:15:16,988 --> 00:15:20,053
split leg plates.
Beautiful lines, too.

249
00:15:20,482 --> 00:15:22,546
Sean spent weeks
looking for the right table.

250
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:24,327
He had to have the best one.

251
00:15:24,452 --> 00:15:25,923
Well, I'm impressed.

252
00:15:26,407 --> 00:15:28,884
Work with the best,
you never go wrong.

253
00:15:29,074 --> 00:15:31,179
Guess I have some
pretty big shoes to fill then.

254
00:15:33,264 --> 00:15:35,031
All right. Well, I guess I'll

255
00:15:35,642 --> 00:15:37,716
let you guys get better acquainted.

256
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,604
So, I understand you already performed
a labial transfer on the patient.

257
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,738
Mm-hmm. About 3 years ago.

258
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:51,280
Fantastic job.

259
00:15:51,558 --> 00:15:54,317
No wonder she flew all the way out here
to have you do it again.

260
00:15:54,442 --> 00:15:56,638
Thank you, doctor.
I just hope one day

261
00:15:56,763 --> 00:15:59,958
- you can say the same thing to me.
- OK. Fire it up.

262
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:35,159
- What do you think?
- Beautiful work, doctor.

263
00:16:36,323 --> 00:16:38,120
OK. Let's do some lipo.

264
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:02,395
After work, a drink?

265
00:17:02,857 --> 00:17:06,524
I'd like to, but I'm scouting locations
for Christian's bachelor party.

266
00:17:06,821 --> 00:17:10,028
Mind if I tag along? It's always best
to get a second opinion.

267
00:17:11,161 --> 00:17:12,161
Sure.

268
00:17:50,084 --> 00:17:52,834
So this is Christian's
favorite place?

269
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:54,105
Nice.

270
00:18:18,963 --> 00:18:20,542
What were you thinking?

271
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:23,881
10 to 15 girls back in the
"Champagne room" for the night?

272
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,850
- That'd be fun.
- Yeah. Fun.

273
00:19:26,353 --> 00:19:29,375
- I say something wrong?
- No, this whole thing is wrong.

274
00:19:31,582 --> 00:19:35,586
Christian used to pull me in here after
a difficult surgery to blow off steam.

275
00:19:36,499 --> 00:19:38,944
Of course he got
the dances for free.

276
00:19:39,894 --> 00:19:42,530
- This doesn't make any sense anymore.
- It is a bachelor party.

277
00:19:42,655 --> 00:19:44,507
It's not just a bachelor party.

278
00:19:45,287 --> 00:19:48,170
I mean, he's not just getting married.
He's leaving.

279
00:19:49,128 --> 00:19:51,323
The 20 years working together.

280
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,596
I suddenly don't have
a partner anymore.

281
00:19:58,077 --> 00:20:01,876
You're a good friend, Sean. I know
I can never replace Christian.

282
00:20:02,684 --> 00:20:06,195
But if you give me a chance,
I know we could make a good team.

283
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,920
It's nothing personal.

284
00:20:12,904 --> 00:20:16,714
Now that you mention it, I really can't
see celebrating in this dump anyway.

285
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,148
It's grotesque.

286
00:20:18,273 --> 00:20:20,677
- Girls aren't so bad.
- The girls are top shelf.

287
00:20:21,131 --> 00:20:23,773
But if you look at the upholstery
on that couch, it's all frayed,

288
00:20:23,898 --> 00:20:25,709
there's food stains on the carpet.

289
00:20:25,834 --> 00:20:27,725
And I don't even wanna
know what you'd see

290
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:31,028
if you shine a black light
on the chairs in the VIP room.

291
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:34,438
Are you hungry? 'cause I know
a great place to grab a bite.

292
00:20:34,563 --> 00:20:37,777
It's not too far from here,
and it's really tastefully decorated.

293
00:20:39,315 --> 00:20:40,315
Sure.

294
00:20:44,754 --> 00:20:47,579
You're such a lucky duckling, Mija,

295
00:20:48,066 --> 00:20:51,958
to have a handsome prince with
the power to turn you into a swan.

296
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:53,412
Ow. That hurts.

297
00:20:53,537 --> 00:20:56,754
They're going to be a little tender, OK?
No fondling for a week.

298
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:00,300
Don't worry.
You'll learn to love it doggie style.

299
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:03,011
Christian, my mother
is standing right next to you.

300
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,054
That's music to my ears.

301
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:08,398
Nothing between a man
and a woman is ever wrong.

302
00:21:10,085 --> 00:21:12,135
There we go. Perfect teardrops.

303
00:21:21,707 --> 00:21:23,723
They're more like water balloons.

304
00:21:25,641 --> 00:21:27,118
Why didn't you do as decided?

305
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,538
I took them down so you don't need
back surgery as you get older, period.

306
00:21:31,265 --> 00:21:33,574
As getting rid of your two
most beautiful assets,

307
00:21:33,699 --> 00:21:36,628
I made an executive decision.
One that we could both benefit from.

308
00:21:43,373 --> 00:21:46,012
You're not even married yet
and you're lying to her.

309
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:48,723
That was a bad decision
for you to make.

310
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:51,181
My daughter is in charge
of her own body.

311
00:21:51,306 --> 00:21:54,187
- You're in charge...
- Please stop.

312
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,680
Please.

313
00:21:56,998 --> 00:21:59,776
Christian, I am in charge
of my own body.

314
00:22:10,657 --> 00:22:12,986
Then why don't you
order your body to put this on

315
00:22:13,111 --> 00:22:14,749
instead of that moth-ridden relic?

316
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:24,293
Oh, my God, this is gorgeous.

317
00:22:24,527 --> 00:22:28,101
- Sorry, mom. Oh, my God, it's gorgeous.
- It's not you.

318
00:22:29,953 --> 00:22:33,017
But you want the world to know
how rich and glamorous you are?

319
00:22:33,451 --> 00:22:35,812
Or do you want to take
your sacred vows

320
00:22:36,316 --> 00:22:40,320
in the same blessed tradition passed on
from mother to daughter for generations?

321
00:22:52,094 --> 00:22:53,705
Ma, where are you going ?

322
00:22:54,135 --> 00:22:56,850
I'm gonna phone your grandmother
and tell her the news.

323
00:22:56,975 --> 00:23:00,333
Dios mio. Me va matar.
She's gonna kill me.

324
00:23:00,698 --> 00:23:03,089
And when she does,
enjoy your wedding.

325
00:23:08,494 --> 00:23:12,339
- Maybe Wilber's wife could...
- One more word and I'll change my will.

326
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:25,371
Here's the key.

327
00:23:25,496 --> 00:23:27,387
Dr. Troy said to make
yourself at home.

328
00:23:27,512 --> 00:23:29,381
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

329
00:25:34,311 --> 00:25:37,138
I just wish you wouldn't hand over
your office to him so soon.

330
00:25:37,263 --> 00:25:39,114
I'm not gonna be using it now.

331
00:25:39,923 --> 00:25:41,886
And he really loves my decor.

332
00:26:05,783 --> 00:26:08,689
- That was awkward.
- What the hell were you doing?

333
00:26:08,814 --> 00:26:11,152
- Masturbating?
- Probably looked that way.

334
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:13,673
Like you were screwing
an invisible woman on my couch.

335
00:26:13,798 --> 00:26:16,490
- It was no invisible woman.
- You were screwing the couch?

336
00:26:17,406 --> 00:26:19,867
Gentlemen,
I'm completely embarrassed.

337
00:26:21,264 --> 00:26:23,408
So let me apologize and explain.

338
00:26:25,387 --> 00:26:29,045
- I struggle with objectum sexuality.
- What's that, couch-banging in English?

339
00:26:29,214 --> 00:26:31,420
OS Is not a widely known condition.

340
00:26:31,789 --> 00:26:33,359
It's barely understood.

341
00:26:34,489 --> 00:26:35,848
But it is real.

342
00:26:36,491 --> 00:26:39,788
Those of us who identify
ourselves with OS are

343
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:44,369
fully capable of forming
a strong relationship with...

344
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:48,105
physical objects.
It stems from a belief in animism.

345
00:26:51,705 --> 00:26:52,876
Wait a second.

346
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:57,490
So you believe that physical objects
can be sentient beings?

347
00:26:57,659 --> 00:26:59,559
Like us, they have feelings.

348
00:27:00,651 --> 00:27:02,298
They can communicate,

349
00:27:03,287 --> 00:27:04,400
even express love.

350
00:27:04,525 --> 00:27:07,083
So all this crap about relationships,
you were talking of

351
00:27:07,252 --> 00:27:09,043
screwing a floor model
at Pottery Barn.

352
00:27:09,212 --> 00:27:11,555
I do have normal
relationships with women.

353
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,920
They're just not as satisfying.

354
00:27:14,285 --> 00:27:16,274
There's a long history
of gender assignments

355
00:27:16,399 --> 00:27:17,885
with cars, boats, buildings...

356
00:27:18,054 --> 00:27:20,721
The difference is I've never
stuck my dick in a tailpipe.

357
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,799
I try to fight the urge.

358
00:27:23,195 --> 00:27:25,886
I didn't want to believe
that I could be capable of

359
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:29,021
finding something like a piece of
furniture so attractive.

360
00:27:30,809 --> 00:27:34,442
But there's something
irresistible to me about a

361
00:27:34,981 --> 00:27:36,809
really well-built piece.

362
00:27:38,847 --> 00:27:42,851
My whole life I've been attracted
to perfection in all of its forms.

363
00:27:45,165 --> 00:27:48,124
As plastic surgeons you can relate,
can't you?

364
00:27:49,712 --> 00:27:50,960
Get out.

365
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:53,963
Get out!

366
00:27:59,174 --> 00:28:01,717
Next time I'll do
a background check.

367
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:29,114
You're right on schedule.
What do you think?

368
00:28:29,623 --> 00:28:32,395
You're very good, Dr. Mcnamara,

369
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,524
but I think it's going to take some time
to get used to these.

370
00:28:36,649 --> 00:28:39,147
They'll lose some volume once
the swelling goes down.

371
00:28:39,272 --> 00:28:41,587
No. I like this size.

372
00:28:42,029 --> 00:28:44,654
It's just that I'm a shy person.

373
00:28:45,118 --> 00:28:46,874
I'm not used to being so

374
00:28:47,495 --> 00:28:48,578
out there.

375
00:28:48,703 --> 00:28:49,974
<i>There's my baby.</i>

376
00:28:51,484 --> 00:28:53,113
Did I tell you, Tito?

377
00:28:53,367 --> 00:28:55,733
Reincarnated as Gina Lollobrigida,

378
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,194
and she's not even
all healed up yet.

379
00:28:58,625 --> 00:28:59,862
Hello, Allegra.

380
00:29:00,214 --> 00:29:02,490
What is he doing here, Manny?

381
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:04,658
He insisted on being here
for your recovery.

382
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:07,328
What a guy, right?

383
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:10,111
Sorry, Dr. Mcnamara, this is Tito.

384
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,063
Our butcher from Coconut Grove.

385
00:29:21,557 --> 00:29:25,054
My best brisket.
I know how you love it.

386
00:29:25,426 --> 00:29:29,430
You should have seen the look on
the X-ray guy's face at the airport.

387
00:29:29,894 --> 00:29:31,519
I'm sorry, Mr. Caldarello, but

388
00:29:31,688 --> 00:29:33,728
we only allow family in recovery.

389
00:29:34,284 --> 00:29:35,606
But Tito is family.

390
00:29:35,987 --> 00:29:39,568
At least he will be after I die
and he marries Allegra.

391
00:29:40,872 --> 00:29:41,695
Him?

392
00:29:43,555 --> 00:29:45,825
You're not gonna find
a better candidate.

393
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:49,036
That butcher shop is a cash cow.
He's a widower,

394
00:29:49,214 --> 00:29:51,663
and his little girl Connie

395
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:53,374
is pregnant with twins.

396
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:55,751
I know how much
you want grandbabies.

397
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,003
You can't handpick
your wife's second husband.

398
00:29:58,172 --> 00:30:00,089
We never agreed to this, Manny.

399
00:30:00,406 --> 00:30:03,092
I'm just helping
move the process along.

400
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,929
I know my wife better
than she knows herself.

401
00:30:07,647 --> 00:30:10,391
She's always telling me how she
and Tito carry on.

402
00:30:11,372 --> 00:30:13,728
I like his ground chuck, Manny.

403
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:16,105
Not to be too forward, Allegra.

404
00:30:17,037 --> 00:30:20,633
I've been giving you
an extra quarter pound of it

405
00:30:21,365 --> 00:30:23,037
for years now, hmm?

406
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:27,840
I'm very flattered, Tito,

407
00:30:28,819 --> 00:30:32,823
but I would have preferred
if Manny had waited until

408
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,654
my transformation was complete

409
00:30:36,103 --> 00:30:38,752
before inviting a suitor in
to see me.

410
00:30:42,935 --> 00:30:44,216
I'm dying, babe.

411
00:30:45,245 --> 00:30:46,804
Every minute counts.

412
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:49,013
If I'm gonna have some
say in all of this,

413
00:30:49,731 --> 00:30:51,557
I don't have any time to waste.

414
00:30:58,603 --> 00:31:00,608
How do you like
her new breasts, Tito?

415
00:31:00,885 --> 00:31:02,193
Grade A prime, no?

416
00:31:03,165 --> 00:31:05,058
Allegra needs her rest.

417
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:07,823
And take your meat with you, please.

418
00:31:11,781 --> 00:31:14,130
Wonderful seeing you, Allegra.

419
00:31:14,972 --> 00:31:16,749
I am at the Ramada Inn,

420
00:31:17,762 --> 00:31:18,897
in Burbank,

421
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,090
if you want to call.

422
00:31:33,899 --> 00:31:35,320
To the beautiful bride.

423
00:31:35,876 --> 00:31:36,840
Thank you.

424
00:31:38,077 --> 00:31:38,897
Finally.

425
00:31:42,027 --> 00:31:45,503
WNBA season tickets.

426
00:31:47,229 --> 00:31:49,323
- I love you, doll.
- Thank you. I love you.

427
00:31:49,815 --> 00:31:53,702
And tell Christian those are
Jack Nicholson's Lakers seats.

428
00:31:55,087 --> 00:31:57,331
Maybe that'll convince him to go.

429
00:31:57,499 --> 00:32:01,503
Men don't want to see tall women
with muscles slamming each other.

430
00:32:01,887 --> 00:32:02,845
Que es eso?

431
00:32:06,206 --> 00:32:07,307
I know, Ma.

432
00:32:07,905 --> 00:32:11,130
That's what you used to tell me
when I used to play for St. Mary's.

433
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,873
And did you have many
dates in high school?

434
00:32:16,765 --> 00:32:17,625
With men?

435
00:32:19,429 --> 00:32:21,489
Are there any normal men

436
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:23,418
in high school?

437
00:32:25,604 --> 00:32:27,736
This one's from me.
It's heavy. Be careful.

438
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,404
I can't even imagine
what's in this one.

439
00:32:30,529 --> 00:32:32,700
Open it up.
You can read the card later.

440
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,101
It's a set of all clad.

441
00:32:40,953 --> 00:32:42,873
Now you're gonna have
to learn how to cook.

442
00:32:42,998 --> 00:32:45,470
Like a straight woman.
No more take-out.

443
00:32:45,595 --> 00:32:47,552
And it has a lifetime guarantee.

444
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,950
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, sweetie.

445
00:32:55,255 --> 00:32:56,433
That's great.

446
00:32:57,023 --> 00:32:57,921
A lifetime.

447
00:33:01,235 --> 00:33:03,789
Oh, sweetie, I didn't mean anything.

448
00:33:04,374 --> 00:33:06,775
None of us can cook, right?

449
00:33:07,562 --> 00:33:08,646
It's not that.

450
00:33:12,135 --> 00:33:14,093
You're all just such great friends.

451
00:33:17,363 --> 00:33:18,704
Christian has cancer.

452
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:23,180
And we won't have
a lot of time together.

453
00:33:23,363 --> 00:33:25,710
Maybe 6 months to a year.

454
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:27,026
Oh, sweetie.

455
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:30,565
I just love him so much.

456
00:33:32,483 --> 00:33:33,927
Now it all makes sense.

457
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:36,347
A man,

458
00:33:36,972 --> 00:33:38,614
a doctor with his looks.

459
00:33:40,115 --> 00:33:40,825
What?

460
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:43,604
- Marrying me?
- That's not what I said.

461
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:46,889
OK, maybe we should all go.

462
00:33:47,014 --> 00:33:49,026
No, no. Please, please. No, don't.

463
00:33:52,137 --> 00:33:56,075
My whole life you made me feel
like something was wrong with me.

464
00:33:56,314 --> 00:33:57,534
I wasn't as pretty

465
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,037
as Christy Sherman or as feminine

466
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:01,906
as Kelly Peterson.

467
00:34:02,031 --> 00:34:05,087
I laughed too loud,
I was awkward, I was clumsy.

468
00:34:06,245 --> 00:34:08,118
You called me your ugly duckling.

469
00:34:09,312 --> 00:34:11,454
- And I believed you.
- That was a joke,

470
00:34:11,766 --> 00:34:13,384
- and you know it.
- Did I?

471
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:15,469
You could never see me
for what I was.

472
00:34:15,744 --> 00:34:17,429
It was always what I wasn't.

473
00:34:17,927 --> 00:34:20,432
It didn't matter that
I was funny, that I was smart.

474
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,344
The truth be told,
if you could replace me with Christy

475
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:27,606
or Kelly, you would have done it,
wouldn't you have?

476
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,740
You weren't exactly an easy

477
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:31,140
child, lizzy.

478
00:34:31,616 --> 00:34:33,166
How could I be? I was

479
00:34:33,366 --> 00:34:34,977
fighting for my life, and the

480
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:37,029
only one on my side was me.

481
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,664
If people made fun of me,

482
00:34:39,789 --> 00:34:40,929
what did you do?

483
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:42,953
You told me to lose weight,

484
00:34:43,483 --> 00:34:44,701
straighten my hair.

485
00:34:44,826 --> 00:34:48,620
Is it any wonder that I spend my life
surgically altering people

486
00:34:48,745 --> 00:34:52,131
who hate themselves
because they do not measure up?

487
00:34:53,248 --> 00:34:56,089
If it wasn't for the people
in this room,

488
00:34:58,116 --> 00:35:00,681
I would have no self-image at all.

489
00:35:01,052 --> 00:35:03,375
These women love me.

490
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:07,187
And a few of them
have even shared my bed.

491
00:35:07,854 --> 00:35:10,979
Yes, that's right, mommy.
I'm so sorry

492
00:35:11,104 --> 00:35:13,189
if that isn't
what you consider normal.

493
00:35:13,314 --> 00:35:16,196
But maybe that's because
you're not capable of loving anyone.

494
00:35:16,761 --> 00:35:18,341
Not even your own daughter.

495
00:35:20,746 --> 00:35:22,536
I don't want you at my wedding.

496
00:35:23,929 --> 00:35:26,202
I don't even want you
in this room anymore.

497
00:35:46,518 --> 00:35:49,646
Make sure you get under the cushions.
I think he consummated it there.

498
00:35:50,406 --> 00:35:52,738
I'd like to pay
for the cleaning, if I may.

499
00:35:53,283 --> 00:35:54,943
What are you doing in my office?

500
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,715
I realized I left behind
my things, and I...

501
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,841
- also wanted to return this to you.
- You could have mailed them in.

502
00:36:00,966 --> 00:36:03,382
I didn't want to put you out
anymore than I already have.

503
00:36:03,507 --> 00:36:05,044
You really wanted to help me?

504
00:36:05,169 --> 00:36:08,073
You could have found me a replacement.
I'm getting married in 2 weeks.

505
00:36:08,198 --> 00:36:09,498
Congratulations.

506
00:36:10,337 --> 00:36:13,014
I feel really terrible
the way things worked out.

507
00:36:13,139 --> 00:36:16,041
Just make sure you don't bang
the receptionist's desk on the way out.

508
00:36:16,166 --> 00:36:19,468
Excuse me. You're not using
any toxic chemicals on her, are you?

509
00:36:42,007 --> 00:36:44,287
If I'd known you were
gonna look like Sofia Loren,

510
00:36:44,412 --> 00:36:46,082
I'd taken better care of myself.

511
00:36:46,207 --> 00:36:47,857
I'm not talking to you.

512
00:36:52,659 --> 00:36:55,087
Look, I know what I did was wrong.

513
00:36:57,172 --> 00:36:58,181
I'm sorry.

514
00:36:58,993 --> 00:37:01,051
Tito was a stupid idea.

515
00:37:01,603 --> 00:37:03,136
Can you ever forgive me, doll?

516
00:37:03,451 --> 00:37:05,222
I can never buy meat there again.

517
00:37:06,953 --> 00:37:10,018
I'm not just a possession
you can give away to the town butcher.

518
00:37:10,855 --> 00:37:12,563
I'm worth more than that, Manny.

519
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:13,981
I know that, baby.

520
00:37:15,004 --> 00:37:17,215
- You deserve the best.
- Yes, she does.

521
00:37:19,853 --> 00:37:21,603
I'm glad you finally see that.

522
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:25,415
And the best is what you're
gonna get from now on.

523
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,245
Anthony...

524
00:37:32,321 --> 00:37:33,820
look what I got for you.

525
00:37:44,398 --> 00:37:45,671
You're beautiful.

526
00:37:49,621 --> 00:37:50,872
These are for you.

527
00:37:57,164 --> 00:37:58,442
So what do you think?

528
00:38:02,193 --> 00:38:03,277
Well, Manny...

529
00:38:06,537 --> 00:38:08,035
if it makes you happy.

530
00:38:45,506 --> 00:38:47,923
She'll forget me
within a month after I'm dead.

531
00:38:48,048 --> 00:38:49,576
People aren't like furniture.

532
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,617
They're not that easy to replace.

533
00:38:57,591 --> 00:39:00,131
Rember what I taught you?
You think you can do it?

534
00:39:00,787 --> 00:39:02,047
Yeah, are you sure?

535
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,027
Are you sure?

536
00:39:04,515 --> 00:39:08,209
I'm gonna go over there and you come
over to me and show me what you got?

537
00:39:10,803 --> 00:39:11,848
OK. Ready?

538
00:39:12,233 --> 00:39:13,275
Come on over.

539
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:20,333
I think we have an expert.
I think you're pretty good.

540
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:22,070
Now you know, the ring bearer,

541
00:39:22,195 --> 00:39:23,735
that's a very important job.

542
00:39:24,336 --> 00:39:26,586
- You think you can handle it?
- Hell yeah.

543
00:39:26,711 --> 00:39:27,747
Hell yeah?

544
00:39:27,872 --> 00:39:28,824
All right!

545
00:39:29,386 --> 00:39:31,952
So listen to me then, why don't
you practice a little bit more?

546
00:39:33,464 --> 00:39:34,404
Kissy kiss.

547
00:39:35,713 --> 00:39:37,089
Thank you. Go.

548
00:39:40,533 --> 00:39:43,229
Your mom really should see him
walking down the aisle.

549
00:39:43,739 --> 00:39:45,799
Please don't start
with me, Christian.

550
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,637
I'm having a hard
enough time as it is.

551
00:39:50,606 --> 00:39:52,633
I never thought
I'd get married, but if I did,

552
00:39:52,758 --> 00:39:55,775
I was pretty sure that my mom
would still be there if she was alive.

553
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,860
- She called you at least?
- Yeah.

554
00:39:58,945 --> 00:40:01,318
But my decision is
final. She's not invited.

555
00:40:02,444 --> 00:40:04,900
You know, you're gonna
need her when I'm gone.

556
00:40:07,178 --> 00:40:07,998
Maybe.

557
00:40:09,924 --> 00:40:13,354
But I don't need her now.
She's been replaced.

558
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,457
You guys are my family.

559
00:40:16,582 --> 00:40:17,998
Well hey there, buddy.

560
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,465
You wanna get in the middle
of this? You do?

561
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:21,590
All right.

562
00:40:23,773 --> 00:40:25,319
Little Wilber sandwich.

563
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:28,616
Little hug. Come on, squeeze it in.

564
00:40:31,608 --> 00:40:32,900
I love you so much.

565
00:40:46,988 --> 00:40:48,405
<i>I don't feel anything.</i>

566
00:40:50,899 --> 00:40:52,437
<i>Keep smoking and keep going.</i>

567
00:40:52,562 --> 00:40:54,244
<i>If you'd have put the money</i>

568
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:57,306
<i>you scored this weed with toward
the bill, we'd made the payment.</i>

569
00:40:57,431 --> 00:40:58,281
<i>Well...</i>

570
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:00,582
<i>all we hear is...</i>

571
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:05,847
<i>Oh, my God, we're on the camera, guys.
We'll all be in the dark.</i>

572
00:41:08,654 --> 00:41:10,948
- What's this?
<i>- I want to go back to school</i>

573
00:41:11,073 --> 00:41:13,090
<i>and be a pediatrician once...</i>

574
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,252
Feels like I'm losing everyone.

575
00:41:15,458 --> 00:41:17,532
<i>- Baby, baby!
- I was out of focus.</i>

576
00:41:18,019 --> 00:41:19,643
<i>I'm setting it on the right.</i>

577
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:28,334
I promise that you won't lose me.

578
00:41:29,013 --> 00:41:31,176
<i>What do you want out of your life?</i>

579
00:41:31,301 --> 00:41:33,178
I know that I can't replace them.

580
00:41:35,215 --> 00:41:37,216
But that's the best I have to offer.

581
00:41:40,691 --> 00:41:41,650
It's a lot.

582
00:41:44,364 --> 00:41:45,946
And a kicking-ass practice

583
00:41:46,071 --> 00:41:50,075
<i>with Sean where we make women
feel better about themselves.</i>

584
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:54,970
<i>I want you.</i>

585
00:41:57,213 --> 00:41:59,564
<i>I want to make
people's lives better.</i>

586
00:42:00,426 --> 00:42:02,323
<i>I want to make a difference.</i>
