1
00:00:00,878 --> 00:00:02,209
<i>Previously on</i> Nip/Tuck...

2
00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:04,769
- Well, Dr. Rowe.
- Call me Teddy.

3
00:00:04,894 --> 00:00:07,214
Stop worrying about
how other people are react to you.

4
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:09,091
And do what you want to do.

5
00:00:09,818 --> 00:00:13,344
You want the honest truth? You'll never
get her a national campaign,

6
00:00:13,531 --> 00:00:16,104
not with those thin villainous lips.

7
00:00:16,323 --> 00:00:19,682
Dr. Troy, plastic surgeon
and breast cancer patient.

8
00:00:19,807 --> 00:00:22,270
I know what it's like to see
my mutilated body.

9
00:00:22,395 --> 00:00:24,023
But damn if I'm gonna accept it.

10
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:25,669
Liz thought you would change.

11
00:00:25,794 --> 00:00:27,754
She informed me
she's moving back to Miami.

12
00:00:32,481 --> 00:00:33,430
Thank you.

13
00:00:37,343 --> 00:00:41,271
Is it really completely pitch black? How
are we going to know what we're eating?

14
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:43,573
You have to have
a little blind faith.

15
00:00:43,698 --> 00:00:47,228
This whole experience is about opening
up your other senses and letting go.

16
00:00:53,977 --> 00:00:55,665
Good evening. Your name, please?

17
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,368
- McNamara.
- 8:15.

18
00:00:58,327 --> 00:01:01,394
Please, put your hand on the shoulder
of the person in front of you

19
00:01:01,803 --> 00:01:02,864
and follow me.

20
00:01:11,568 --> 00:01:14,934
- Jesus, I can't see a thing.
- That's the idea, jackass.

21
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:17,700
We didn't come
to Pasadena to eat at el pollo loco.

22
00:01:17,825 --> 00:01:19,604
Don't worry, mr. McNamara.

23
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:21,443
I've done this a few times.

24
00:01:21,568 --> 00:01:23,625
Just keep your hand on my shoulder.

25
00:01:24,937 --> 00:01:27,835
Your waiter will be along shortly
to present the amuse bouche

26
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,581
and tell you about the menu.

27
00:01:29,706 --> 00:01:31,006
Enjoy your evening.

28
00:01:32,401 --> 00:01:33,341
Is he gone?

29
00:01:33,667 --> 00:01:34,888
Give me your hand.

30
00:01:36,294 --> 00:01:38,513
The amuse bouche, Mr. McNamara.

31
00:01:40,572 --> 00:01:42,472
Somebody's not wearing any panties.

32
00:01:44,669 --> 00:01:45,888
Don't answer that.

33
00:01:46,013 --> 00:01:48,232
It's Julia.
One of the kids might be sick.

34
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,078


35
00:01:50,203 --> 00:01:51,583
Yeah, what's going on?

36
00:01:53,667 --> 00:01:56,523
Of course. My accountant sent
it directly to the school.

37
00:01:56,807 --> 00:01:59,623
Hang up the phone, Sean.
You can deal with this tomorrow.

38
00:02:00,042 --> 00:02:03,580
Just tell 'em if it doesn't post
until monday, I'll call Stan.

39
00:02:06,044 --> 00:02:08,085
No, I sent
Annie's sweater last week.

40
00:02:09,316 --> 00:02:11,314
- Yeah. Blue cardigan.
- Sean...

41
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,963
It was the only one
in her top drawer.

42
00:02:15,556 --> 00:02:17,405
Fine. I'll check again. OK?

43
00:02:18,473 --> 00:02:19,686
Call you tomorrow.

44
00:02:21,669 --> 00:02:22,469
Sorry.

45
00:02:23,918 --> 00:02:24,898
Phone's off.

46
00:02:25,328 --> 00:02:26,707
No more interruptions.

47
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:29,215
Teddy?

48
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:31,890
Teddy?

49
00:02:38,228 --> 00:02:40,409
Come on.
It could have been an emergency.

50
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,076
But it wasn't, was it?

51
00:02:42,387 --> 00:02:43,187


52
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:44,355
I apologize.

53
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,916
But it's over now.
Let's go back inside.

54
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,878
No, Sean.

55
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:50,035
Until you stop taking responsibility

56
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,700
for every little moment
of everyone else's lives...

57
00:02:53,419 --> 00:02:56,758
- ... I'm not interested.
- I can't ignore my responsibilities.

58
00:02:56,928 --> 00:02:58,953
A rolling stone gathers no moss.

59
00:02:59,852 --> 00:03:02,264
And baby, you got a lot of moss.

60
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:08,125
Sorry, I'm late.

61
00:04:08,813 --> 00:04:10,439
Jesus, Sean, you could have

62
00:04:10,807 --> 00:04:13,836
scheduled Mr. Tree man in a couple hours
after I finished digesting my sushi.

63
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:16,280
He speaks
perfect english, Christian.

64
00:04:19,154 --> 00:04:20,843
I'm used to such reactions,

65
00:04:21,193 --> 00:04:21,993
doctor.

66
00:04:22,266 --> 00:04:25,233
One day,
doctors at U.C.L.A. flew me from

67
00:04:25,804 --> 00:04:29,504
Bali to Los Angeles
to study my unique condition.

68
00:04:29,907 --> 00:04:32,938
I caused a student nurse to faint

69
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:34,857
and switch her career.

70
00:04:35,933 --> 00:04:39,320
I've been looking like this
since on my 18th birthday.

71
00:04:39,861 --> 00:04:41,995
That's when I first scraped my foot.

72
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:45,964
I was swimming
with a girl I had a crush on.

73
00:04:46,297 --> 00:04:48,557
The first wart appeared
shortly afterwards

74
00:04:48,682 --> 00:04:50,873
and began to spread uncontrollably.

75
00:04:51,636 --> 00:04:54,335
Doctors at U.C.L.A. gave him
massive doses of vitamin A

76
00:04:54,765 --> 00:04:56,921
to retard the spread of the virus.

77
00:04:57,089 --> 00:04:59,760
- I'm guessing that didn't work.
- Mr. Sabri's condition

78
00:04:59,885 --> 00:05:02,007
was complicated by a rare

79
00:05:02,132 --> 00:05:05,220
immune system deficiency
which enabled the virus to cause

80
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,290
a massive proliferation
of his cells,

81
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,850
forming these cutaneous horns.

82
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:11,549
It's just a guess but

83
00:05:11,674 --> 00:05:15,314
U.C.L.A. is not paying for our
buddy Budi's little mani-pedi.

84
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:18,983
Mr. Sabri, my partner and I
don't want to mislead you.

85
00:05:20,932 --> 00:05:24,114
It could take half a dozen procedures.
And even then

86
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:26,377
we can't be certain
how successful we'll be

87
00:05:26,502 --> 00:05:28,789
or what specifically
we can accomplish.

88
00:05:28,914 --> 00:05:30,816
You're saying that I should...

89
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:34,124
forget my dream as a fashion model.

90
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:39,990
When I was younger,

91
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,401
the people in my village

92
00:05:43,006 --> 00:05:44,585
would gather their children

93
00:05:44,895 --> 00:05:46,635
inside when they saw me coming.

94
00:05:48,617 --> 00:05:50,238
I was quite bitter about it.

95
00:05:55,405 --> 00:05:56,205
Now,

96
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:00,150
if I could just

97
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,418
walk on my own,

98
00:06:04,355 --> 00:06:05,175
lie down

99
00:06:05,886 --> 00:06:06,906
without pain.

100
00:06:09,781 --> 00:06:11,323
To think that I could just

101
00:06:12,147 --> 00:06:13,448
find joy in my life.

102
00:06:16,787 --> 00:06:17,927
Or maybe one day

103
00:06:20,001 --> 00:06:21,181
feel human again.

104
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:50,659
<i>Come on baby, dry your eyes,</i>

105
00:06:51,288 --> 00:06:54,379
<i>wipe your tears.</i>

106
00:06:56,476 --> 00:06:59,241
<i>Never like to see you cry...</i>

107
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:00,325


108
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:03,338
How did you get home last night?
Call your mom?

109
00:07:04,343 --> 00:07:06,642
I hitched a ride
with our maitre D, actually.

110
00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:12,813
Don't you want to get a shot with
Mr. Sabri for your photo album, Teddy?

111
00:07:12,938 --> 00:07:16,727
There is a big difference
between Mr. Skerritt and this poor man.

112
00:07:17,213 --> 00:07:20,481
He's a victim. All he's known
for years is pain and isolation.

113
00:07:21,378 --> 00:07:22,238
Whatever.

114
00:07:22,363 --> 00:07:25,734
They'll be plenty of photo ops tomorrow
at the press conference that I called.

115
00:07:25,859 --> 00:07:29,810
Mr. Sappy here should be well enough
to smile at the camera and say cheese.

116
00:07:31,281 --> 00:07:34,364
I know. I feel just as bad
for this guy as you guys do. All right?

117
00:07:34,489 --> 00:07:36,530
But I mean, come on,
let's think about it here.

118
00:07:36,655 --> 00:07:39,035
He's gonna clock up
at least 60 billable hours.

119
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,502
- How are we gonna get that back?
- If you want attention,

120
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:45,212
co-author the paper I'm gonna write
for the New england journal of medicine.

121
00:07:46,026 --> 00:07:47,981
You know,
I thought being sick yourself

122
00:07:48,106 --> 00:07:51,095
might open your eyes a little to
what people like Mr. Sabri go through.

123
00:07:51,264 --> 00:07:54,056
Do me a favor. Don't lecture me
on how I should deal with my cancer.

124
00:07:55,531 --> 00:07:57,198
I dealt with it my own way.

125
00:07:57,323 --> 00:08:00,562
As far as I'm concerned,
I think I did a pretty good job.

126
00:08:00,902 --> 00:08:03,120
And I'm
a much better person because of it.

127
00:08:03,797 --> 00:08:07,263
Anyway, I have my
12-week check up tomorrow with

128
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:11,293
Dr. Moss. So I'm looking to put
this whole thing behind me.

129
00:08:12,917 --> 00:08:13,871
Oh, Jesus.

130
00:08:15,065 --> 00:08:16,701
Can you finish up for me?

131
00:08:18,217 --> 00:08:19,017
Thanks.

132
00:08:27,721 --> 00:08:28,541
Come on.

133
00:08:30,101 --> 00:08:31,521
Give me another chance.

134
00:08:31,646 --> 00:08:33,376
I'm not big on second chances.

135
00:08:33,501 --> 00:08:36,612
If I wanted to be
with a pussy, I'd be a lesbian.

136
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,649
Well, I can loosen up.

137
00:08:42,961 --> 00:08:44,021
I can be wild.

138
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,608
I had sex with a doll once.

139
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:51,496
- I'll tell you all about it over lunch.
- Fine.

140
00:08:52,757 --> 00:08:54,759
Pick me up. My place. 1:00 sharp.

141
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,158
So you swear she's had no

142
00:09:00,283 --> 00:09:03,628
fever, no rashes,
no swelling of any kind?

143
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,915
Oh, my God, Christian, she's fine.
She's never been better.

144
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,326
Except you can see
the collagen's been absorbed.

145
00:09:13,451 --> 00:09:16,233
And we're back to our thin,
villainous lip problem.

146
00:09:17,285 --> 00:09:20,465
- You're gonna have to do it again.
- When pigs fly sweetie pie.

147
00:09:21,495 --> 00:09:23,534
I'm still having nightmares
about what I did.

148
00:09:23,659 --> 00:09:25,962
Yeah, but you see,
the Steves called.

149
00:09:26,087 --> 00:09:28,338
And she's short listed
for this new vintage

150
00:09:28,463 --> 00:09:30,402
inspired baby
clothing line for Target.

151
00:09:30,776 --> 00:09:33,447
Read my thin,
villainous lips, ma rose.

152
00:09:33,961 --> 00:09:36,283
- It ain't never gonna happen.
- OK.

153
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,846
We'll just go down the block
to Dr. Potsander's office.

154
00:09:38,971 --> 00:09:39,951
He'll do it.

155
00:09:40,076 --> 00:09:43,466
And I think we're gonna go to Hermes
to get a new little baby treat.

156
00:09:43,591 --> 00:09:45,173
So we'll talk to you later.

157
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,979
- You're not taking her anywhere.
- Let go of me!

158
00:09:56,104 --> 00:09:56,924
Hear me!

159
00:09:57,049 --> 00:09:59,956
Hey, easy you two.
No fighting in front of the baby.

160
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,154
How's my girl?
Let me see those lips.

161
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,231
I was just telling Christian that the
collagen he gave her has been absorbed.

162
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:10,442
So if he wants her career to stay on
the fast track, she needs more of it.

163
00:10:11,213 --> 00:10:14,071
First of all, mother of the year,
I happen to know you did it.

164
00:10:14,442 --> 00:10:18,358
Sean, you're such an easy lay
in every possible way.

165
00:10:18,815 --> 00:10:19,699
He did it.

166
00:10:20,861 --> 00:10:23,474
I told him I'd take the blame
to save his pretty face.

167
00:10:30,651 --> 00:10:32,990
Poor grandpa
is just too embarrassed to admit

168
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,843
that he wants his granddaughter to be
a big star because he'll never be one.

169
00:10:42,092 --> 00:10:44,873
If I find out you've injected
anything into Jenna again,

170
00:10:45,161 --> 00:10:47,166
I'll have you arrested
for child endangerment.

171
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,351
Damn straight.

172
00:10:48,757 --> 00:10:49,697
Am I clear?

173
00:10:56,121 --> 00:10:58,532
I walked in. That crazy bitch
is injecting Jenna herself.

174
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,044
I stepped in so there wouldn't be
any complications.

175
00:11:01,169 --> 00:11:04,288
- I love her. I'm trying to do the best.
- Bullshit! You did this for you!

176
00:11:04,669 --> 00:11:07,417
Cause you wanted your granddaughter
to get a modeling contract.

177
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:10,460
Stop rationalizing, and think about
the reality of what you've done.

178
00:11:10,818 --> 00:11:13,669
I thought you of all people,
someone who was the victim of abuse,

179
00:11:13,794 --> 00:11:15,255
would have known better!

180
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,367
How much further
can you fall, Christian?

181
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:42,955
Look at you.

182
00:11:43,646 --> 00:11:45,107
How do you like my house?

183
00:11:45,614 --> 00:11:47,116
I love it. It's amazing.

184
00:11:52,567 --> 00:11:53,912
Here's to a great day.

185
00:11:59,729 --> 00:12:01,470
Come on. I want to show you the

186
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:02,678
bedroom first.

187
00:12:03,882 --> 00:12:05,015
This place is huge.

188
00:12:05,602 --> 00:12:06,602
Family money.

189
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,069
Who's this?

190
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,945
My brother, his sister,
and their daughter, Wren.

191
00:12:14,614 --> 00:12:15,576
I'm adopted.

192
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:24,576
I guess we can just order in.

193
00:12:26,108 --> 00:12:27,031
Or eat out.

194
00:12:36,849 --> 00:12:39,216
Strange. I didn't think I left
the air conditioning on.

195
00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:45,401
The house is listed at 4.5.

196
00:12:45,777 --> 00:12:47,512
But I think
I can get them down to 3.

197
00:12:47,637 --> 00:12:50,139
It's been on the market
for almost a month already.

198
00:12:50,264 --> 00:12:51,457
Did you hear that?

199
00:12:51,941 --> 00:12:52,741
No.

200
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:57,359
All the fixtures are original,
painstakingly restored by the owners.

201
00:12:58,192 --> 00:13:00,385
Carra marble,
brazilian rosewood throughout.

202
00:13:02,717 --> 00:13:04,563
Someone's breaking into your house.

203
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:07,661
I have a secret to tell you.

204
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:11,039
- When was the restoration done?
- 2005, I think.

205
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,471
I don't really have a korean brother.
And this isn't really my house.

206
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,249
What do you mean
it's not your house?

207
00:13:17,862 --> 00:13:20,867
I thought it would be fun to break
into an open house and have sex.

208
00:13:20,992 --> 00:13:22,259
Aren't you having fun?

209
00:13:22,646 --> 00:13:24,778
You're gonna love
the view from the bedroom.

210
00:13:24,903 --> 00:13:26,512
You can see all of los angeles.

211
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:29,082
You can do one of 2 things.
You can either lose your shit

212
00:13:29,207 --> 00:13:31,341
and make a big scene
or you can keep having fun.

213
00:13:31,466 --> 00:13:33,545
It's up to you.
But you better act fast.

214
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:37,898
Oh, my God!

215
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:39,631
Who are you?

216
00:13:40,995 --> 00:13:44,489
Hi. Are these sheets included
in the asking price?

217
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,907
No. They are not.

218
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,664
And they're 800 threat count egyptian,
so the kims better not find any

219
00:13:49,869 --> 00:13:52,950
jizzum stains
when they return from Big Sur.

220
00:13:53,945 --> 00:13:57,932
- Are you two interested in buying?
- It's a little above our price range.

221
00:13:58,588 --> 00:13:59,741
Well, we love it.

222
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:02,090
We... we'll take it.

223
00:14:03,424 --> 00:14:05,886
What are you gonna do,
write us a check from jail?

224
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:07,429
Would you take 20% down.

225
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:11,308
We're both doctors.
I'm sure we can arrange it.

226
00:14:12,192 --> 00:14:13,185
Doctors?

227
00:14:14,624 --> 00:14:18,624
There's a nice house
in Hancock park I know you'll love.

228
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:21,124
This one just went off the market.

229
00:14:35,337 --> 00:14:38,013
Dr. Troy,
this is just aconsultation.

230
00:14:38,401 --> 00:14:39,861
Never hurts to advertise.

231
00:14:40,372 --> 00:14:42,831
Would you look at that?
Courtesy of McNamara-Troy.

232
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:44,877
Extraordinary.

233
00:14:47,338 --> 00:14:49,622
I'll be sure
to recommend your practice.

234
00:14:49,747 --> 00:14:51,436
Good. Good. Good. Good.

235
00:14:52,777 --> 00:14:55,352
I'm just glad to have
the whole goddamn ordeal over with.

236
00:14:56,089 --> 00:14:59,203
I'll tell you one thing I know
and that is chemo ain't for pussies.

237
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:03,318
I'd actually like to try you
on a few courses of aromasin.

238
00:15:04,847 --> 00:15:06,578
It's known to be effective in...

239
00:15:06,918 --> 00:15:09,323
some of the more resistant cancers.

240
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,528
The tumor has spread
to the supraclavicular lymph nodes.

241
00:15:20,231 --> 00:15:23,171
The side effects are
less dramatic with aromasin.

242
00:15:23,601 --> 00:15:26,925
Hot flashes. Joint pain.
Headache. Fatigue.

243
00:15:28,144 --> 00:15:29,259
And the results?

244
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,429
Uncertain.

245
00:15:33,572 --> 00:15:36,261
Our recent trials indicate
that it slows the progression.

246
00:15:36,386 --> 00:15:38,872
It can also reduce
the bone mineral density.

247
00:15:38,997 --> 00:15:42,857
So there is
greater likelihood of fractures.

248
00:15:44,967 --> 00:15:47,118
In other words,
I'll become so weak that...

249
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,156
my bones will break.

250
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,247
Possibly...

251
00:15:51,853 --> 00:15:54,618
in the final stages of the disease.

252
00:16:06,108 --> 00:16:08,549
- Give me a ballpark.
- 6 months.

253
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,539
With aromasin we might be able
to give you a few more.

254
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:18,722
I think I'll...

255
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,062
I appreciate everything you've done.
But I think I'll pass on another round.

256
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:27,082
I'm over my limit.

257
00:16:32,487 --> 00:16:33,653
You have kids?

258
00:16:33,778 --> 00:16:35,225
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

259
00:16:36,668 --> 00:16:37,468
Good.

260
00:16:38,594 --> 00:16:40,632
You won't have
to go through this alone.

261
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:18,818
We get to do it in a tee pee?

262
00:17:18,943 --> 00:17:20,622
Can I talk to you for a second?

263
00:17:21,385 --> 00:17:23,708
I don't want to get into it
You're a moral vacuum.

264
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:27,138
Nothing I say, nothing I do,
nothing I wish for is gonna change that.

265
00:17:32,657 --> 00:17:34,541
So where are you guys off to anyway?

266
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:36,795
The desert. Don't wait up.

267
00:18:35,112 --> 00:18:37,782
- Did you see me?
- I did. I saw you.

268
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:42,495
But you shouldn't be doing that.
Your muscles are too atrophied.

269
00:18:42,881 --> 00:18:44,330
Hardly, Dr. Troy.

270
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:47,124
I've been exercising them everyday

271
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:50,840
in preparation for the day
when I can walk to the TV

272
00:18:50,965 --> 00:18:52,843
and pick up the remote control.

273
00:18:57,517 --> 00:18:58,967
The best part is...

274
00:19:06,594 --> 00:19:08,153
let me take a look.

275
00:19:10,325 --> 00:19:11,649
Give me your hand.

276
00:19:17,642 --> 00:19:21,392
Let me ask you something.
With everything you've been through...

277
00:19:21,812 --> 00:19:24,101
All the pain and
the suffering and...

278
00:19:25,481 --> 00:19:29,334
just everything. You ever...
considered giving up?

279
00:19:29,744 --> 00:19:31,377
I don't have anything to give up.

280
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:33,947
No, I mean, suicide.

281
00:19:35,054 --> 00:19:36,673
Taking your own life.

282
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,330
No.

283
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,472
Not possible.

284
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:45,896
Since I believe

285
00:19:46,408 --> 00:19:47,544
as a Hindu

286
00:19:49,905 --> 00:19:51,093
that even I

287
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,575
in this inhuman body

288
00:19:55,553 --> 00:19:57,821
am a true expression of God.

289
00:19:59,972 --> 00:20:01,032
You understand?

290
00:20:01,203 --> 00:20:02,353
I understand.

291
00:20:04,656 --> 00:20:06,743
I'm a firm believer that...

292
00:20:09,066 --> 00:20:11,000
I'm very much on my own
in this life.

293
00:20:11,407 --> 00:20:14,236
- Do you pray, Dr. Troy?
- Well...

294
00:20:16,829 --> 00:20:18,892
- not anymore.
- You should.

295
00:20:19,993 --> 00:20:21,010
It works.

296
00:20:21,732 --> 00:20:24,806
You see,
my prayers brought me to you.

297
00:20:25,954 --> 00:20:28,004
And in turn it brings me

298
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:31,771
closer to my real dream in my life.

299
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:35,097
- And what's that?
- To find a woman.

300
00:20:36,593 --> 00:20:38,485
She doesn't have
to be a beautiful woman,

301
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,669
just a woman

302
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:44,103
who would consider holding me,

303
00:20:45,937 --> 00:20:47,806
perhaps enjoy my jokes.

304
00:20:49,964 --> 00:20:52,630
Another soul that would accept me

305
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:54,745
warts and all.

306
00:21:03,443 --> 00:21:05,148
<i>I am a shaman. Welcome.</i>

307
00:21:05,525 --> 00:21:07,140
We fasted like you asked.

308
00:21:07,537 --> 00:21:08,537
Good.

309
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:11,144
Have you ever experienced
Ayahuasca before?

310
00:21:11,475 --> 00:21:13,694
I dropped acid
a few times in college.

311
00:21:13,936 --> 00:21:16,024
Ayahuasca is much stronger.

312
00:21:16,427 --> 00:21:19,277
You're both about to go much deeper
than you ever have before.

313
00:21:19,785 --> 00:21:21,197
What do you mean deeper?

314
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:23,739
It is possible
under the power of the tea

315
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:25,283
to cleanse yourself

316
00:21:25,457 --> 00:21:27,242
of all anxieties and depressions.

317
00:21:27,663 --> 00:21:30,581
You can even find a
greater spirituality.

318
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,373
But there is a price.

319
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,752
The Incas call it the vine of the dead
for a reason.

320
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:39,175
The nausea will be extreme.

321
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,700
You will want to die.

322
00:21:40,825 --> 00:21:43,626
But you must have strong courage
and discipline.

323
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:48,264
And if you are lucky, you may
experience what is called

324
00:21:48,915 --> 00:21:50,697
the murdering of the ego.

325
00:21:50,822 --> 00:21:52,644
Actually,
I think I'd like to try that.

326
00:22:44,921 --> 00:22:47,448
<i>You are petrified Dr. McNamara.</i>

327
00:22:48,802 --> 00:22:51,536
<i> Untouchable like me.</i>

328
00:22:53,447 --> 00:22:54,596
<i>Not human.</i>

329
00:22:56,094 --> 00:22:58,875
- I can't move!
<i>- That is your curse.</i>

330
00:23:04,029 --> 00:23:06,340
This is fantastic.

331
00:23:07,888 --> 00:23:09,342
<i>Are you happy now?</i>

332
00:23:10,121 --> 00:23:11,472
<i>Are you happy now?</i>

333
00:23:32,284 --> 00:23:33,446
Sixty-six.

334
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:38,656
No history of heart disease.
No diabetes, hypertension.

335
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:43,129
Last week his wife fell off
a ladder in her garden and died.

336
00:23:43,634 --> 00:23:46,382
2 days later he has a
massive infarction.

337
00:23:47,389 --> 00:23:49,139
A broken heart. Romantic.

338
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,346
- So, how's Miami treating you?
- It's good to be back.

339
00:23:55,141 --> 00:23:56,951
I haven't found a place yet.

340
00:23:57,076 --> 00:23:59,559
I'm thinking I want to get
a condo by the beach.

341
00:23:59,684 --> 00:24:01,897
I sleep a lot better
with the sound of the ocean.

342
00:24:02,022 --> 00:24:04,859
You know, I hope it's not out of line,
Liz, I have this really

343
00:24:05,028 --> 00:24:06,344
terrific friend,

344
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:10,406
just moved in from out of town.
Any interest in being set up?

345
00:24:11,093 --> 00:24:14,136
- Man or woman?
- Uh, sorry, I just assumed...

346
00:24:14,763 --> 00:24:16,781
- aren't you gay?
- She is

347
00:24:17,937 --> 00:24:19,540
with everybody else except for me.

348
00:24:19,863 --> 00:24:21,542
I am sorry. You cannot be in here.

349
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:24,843
I'm a doctor, sweetheart.
I know the sterile zone.

350
00:24:24,968 --> 00:24:26,214
OK, I am so sorry.

351
00:24:26,383 --> 00:24:28,113
I am so sorry. This is

352
00:24:28,371 --> 00:24:30,510
Dr. Christian Troy.
He's my old boss.

353
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:32,344
And what are you doing here?

354
00:24:32,657 --> 00:24:34,972
I've been on a plane or in an airport
for 8 hours.

355
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:37,934
I need to talk to you face to face.

356
00:24:38,896 --> 00:24:40,603
I'm not coming back, Christian.

357
00:24:46,758 --> 00:24:48,820
I'm a bad person, Lizzie.
I know that.

358
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:54,158
- That is not what I am saying.
- No, it's what I'm saying.

359
00:24:57,722 --> 00:25:00,540
I know I don't have much of a
conscience. I don't know what happened.

360
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:03,344
Either I was born without it
or it just kinda rotted away

361
00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:06,038
like some gangrenous appendage
or something.

362
00:25:06,764 --> 00:25:10,692
And I know I get down on you about all
your speeches and stuff. I just... I...

363
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:19,338
I want you to be the voice in my head
that tells me right from wrong.

364
00:25:25,785 --> 00:25:28,235
I wish you'd come home with me,
Lizzie.

365
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:32,863
I need you.

366
00:25:34,547 --> 00:25:37,360
We have been down
this road before, Christian.

367
00:25:42,295 --> 00:25:43,745
What's in it for me?

368
00:25:48,133 --> 00:25:49,380
I want you to marry me.

369
00:26:14,048 --> 00:26:15,248
Lose the rock.

370
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,674
It's getting
in the way of the laryngoscope.

371
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:19,399
Come on. Wish me luck.

372
00:26:19,986 --> 00:26:22,336
It's a whole new journey for me now.

373
00:26:22,629 --> 00:26:23,629
Good luck.

374
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,120
Like throwing confetti
at the hindenburg.

375
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:30,410
- I'm not gonna hurt her, Sean.
- Right.

376
00:26:30,871 --> 00:26:34,258
She finally pulls herself together
in Miami. And you lure her back to what?

377
00:26:34,647 --> 00:26:36,146
Re-break her heart? Nice.

378
00:26:37,157 --> 00:26:39,554
What are we supposed to do with Teddy?
Just toss her out?

379
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:42,674
Well, if her dedication to her job
is any indication, yeah.

380
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,387
- I mean, where the hell is she?
- Teddy's sick.

381
00:26:45,512 --> 00:26:47,835
We ate something bad.
It was probably the oysters.

382
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,365
I was up all night myself.

383
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:52,109
You look a little green
around the gills there buddy boy.

384
00:26:53,258 --> 00:26:55,126
Can't you just be happy for me?

385
00:26:56,797 --> 00:26:59,397
Liz is the only woman
I've ever been with

386
00:26:59,734 --> 00:27:01,624
who forces me to stop being a dick.

387
00:27:01,749 --> 00:27:03,868
She doesn't do it by judging me.

388
00:27:03,993 --> 00:27:06,415
She does it by loving me.

389
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:13,253
I don't want to go to my grave knowing
that everybody thinks I'm some kind of

390
00:27:13,425 --> 00:27:16,050
soulless, inhumane asshole.

391
00:27:17,216 --> 00:27:20,016
Look, I'm not
some kind of moral paragon, OK.

392
00:27:20,801 --> 00:27:23,951
And you're not about to die.
You're getting married.

393
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:27,410
Don't confuse the 2
like the rest of us.

394
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:30,797
Linda is going to be
the maid of honor.

395
00:27:30,922 --> 00:27:34,329
I guess that means we'll be
getting married on a golf course?

396
00:27:34,454 --> 00:27:36,004
Congratulations, Liz.

397
00:27:36,129 --> 00:27:37,779
I'm very happy for you.

398
00:27:38,611 --> 00:27:39,660
I can tell.

399
00:28:28,097 --> 00:28:29,097
15 blade.

400
00:28:46,789 --> 00:28:47,789
Excuse me.

401
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:50,318
I'm not feeling very well.

402
00:29:11,057 --> 00:29:12,694
Christian, we have to talk.

403
00:29:12,819 --> 00:29:15,699
I'll do anything you ask. Just
don't make me get married in a church.

404
00:29:15,824 --> 00:29:18,130
I think that Teddy
is stealing drugs from the office.

405
00:29:18,638 --> 00:29:20,878
A ton of inventory is missing.

406
00:29:21,003 --> 00:29:24,102
- Who else could have done it?
- Teddy is not a druggy, trust me.

407
00:29:24,227 --> 00:29:27,506
I can smell a druggy a mile away.
Take a look at these pictures from bali.

408
00:29:27,631 --> 00:29:29,810
This resort is fantastic
for a honeymoon. Come on.

409
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:32,937
We are legally obligated
to report this to the authorities.

410
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:35,928
Now, I don't know Teddy at all.
But we have to bring Sean into this.

411
00:29:36,053 --> 00:29:39,353
- This is serious...
- Can you give it a rest, please.

412
00:29:39,478 --> 00:29:41,487
- I stole the drugs.
- What?!

413
00:29:42,097 --> 00:29:43,030
I stole them.

414
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,245
And may I ask you why?

415
00:29:51,233 --> 00:29:53,463
I was contemplating suicide.
Then I changed my mind.

416
00:29:53,588 --> 00:29:55,788
And asked you to marry me instead.

417
00:29:58,382 --> 00:30:00,326
You are not a suicidal person.

418
00:30:05,127 --> 00:30:06,474
Your cancer came back.

419
00:30:10,957 --> 00:30:11,777
How bad?

420
00:30:14,299 --> 00:30:15,749
6 months to a year.

421
00:30:20,788 --> 00:30:22,838
Is that why you proposed to me?

422
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:27,967
I thought
about taking charge of my death

423
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:32,037
by using those pills. Then I realized
that I wanted to take charge of my life.

424
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:33,625
And...

425
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:37,008
I want to spend
the rest of my life with you...

426
00:30:38,424 --> 00:30:39,674
you and Wilbur.

427
00:30:39,949 --> 00:30:41,688
When were you going to tell me

428
00:30:41,813 --> 00:30:45,009
what my first year of marriage
was going to be like?

429
00:30:45,377 --> 00:30:47,227
Oh, well maybe you weren't.

430
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,898
Maybe you were just going to act
like you were devastated and surprised

431
00:30:51,023 --> 00:30:54,249
- when you started to go to shit.
- I guess I just wanted to enjoy the...

432
00:30:54,374 --> 00:30:56,965
sweetness of getting married.
At least for a little while.

433
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:59,690
You wanted to marry me
so that I would help you die.

434
00:31:01,453 --> 00:31:03,953
You know what,
you can just go to hell!

435
00:31:13,516 --> 00:31:15,266
Yeah, I got your message.

436
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:18,307
I'm at the office right now.

437
00:31:19,789 --> 00:31:20,878
Where are you?

438
00:31:42,498 --> 00:31:43,595
What's this?

439
00:31:45,095 --> 00:31:47,095
I haven't seen you for 3 days.

440
00:31:49,516 --> 00:31:50,525
Where you been?

441
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:52,913
I heard your old anesthesiologist
came back.

442
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:55,688
I figured you didn't need me
here anymore.

443
00:31:59,715 --> 00:32:02,115
You ever done it
on a surgical table?

444
00:32:02,589 --> 00:32:04,255
I don't think this is the time.

445
00:32:05,921 --> 00:32:08,671
You know my motto.
No time like the present.

446
00:32:15,521 --> 00:32:17,421
You ever screwed on nitrous?

447
00:32:18,085 --> 00:32:21,222
- It's dangerous.
- Not when done on moderation.

448
00:32:21,758 --> 00:32:24,142
And you will have
the most intense orgasm

449
00:32:24,267 --> 00:32:26,569
you have ever experienced.

450
00:32:26,942 --> 00:32:28,210
You can trust me.

451
00:32:28,335 --> 00:32:30,035
I'm an anesthesiologist.

452
00:32:36,541 --> 00:32:39,041
You want this place
to go up in flames?

453
00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:43,329
And there he is.

454
00:32:46,199 --> 00:32:47,381
Our Sean.

455
00:32:47,861 --> 00:32:48,911
So careful

456
00:32:51,078 --> 00:32:53,324
and methodical. And safe.

457
00:32:54,485 --> 00:32:55,535
And boring?

458
00:32:57,587 --> 00:32:59,287
Look, I spent my morning

459
00:33:00,033 --> 00:33:02,479
having a flashback
that interfered with a surgery.

460
00:33:03,263 --> 00:33:06,727
I spent my afternoon on the phone
with a very pissed off realtor

461
00:33:06,852 --> 00:33:09,702
who only calmed down
after I made a very large

462
00:33:10,106 --> 00:33:12,556
contribution
to his favorite charity.

463
00:33:15,023 --> 00:33:18,120
- You're going too far.
- You are such a buzz kill.

464
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:19,563
No.

465
00:33:20,877 --> 00:33:22,077
I'm a surgeon.

466
00:33:22,703 --> 00:33:24,753
It's in my D.N.A. to be careful

467
00:33:25,185 --> 00:33:26,885
and methodical and safe.

468
00:33:27,645 --> 00:33:29,825
The very nature that you detest

469
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:31,842
is what keeps people alive
on my table.

470
00:33:33,232 --> 00:33:36,249
I tried.
But I can't change who I am.

471
00:33:38,341 --> 00:33:41,109
Frankly, I don't want to have
to apologize for it anymore.

472
00:33:54,855 --> 00:33:56,055
I am so sorry.

473
00:33:57,872 --> 00:33:58,872
For what?

474
00:33:59,811 --> 00:34:01,961
'cause this isn't gonna work out.

475
00:34:24,517 --> 00:34:27,067
Ain't gonna find it out there
buddy boy.

476
00:34:27,411 --> 00:34:28,411
Find what?

477
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:31,402
Something to say.
Come on. Sit down.

478
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:34,511
My best friend just told me
that he's...

479
00:34:34,636 --> 00:34:36,494
dying. You got to say it.

480
00:34:36,744 --> 00:34:39,118
I actually have to say the word.
It's very important.

481
00:34:39,695 --> 00:34:42,413
It just gets a lot worse if you don't.
Trust me.

482
00:34:42,859 --> 00:34:45,216
Look, I'm the one who's got
a $150,000 wedding ring.

483
00:34:45,341 --> 00:34:47,367
- Jesus.
- You'll get your money back.

484
00:34:47,492 --> 00:34:49,448
I don't care about the money.

485
00:34:51,258 --> 00:34:53,674
It's Lizzie.
You're right what you said.

486
00:34:53,799 --> 00:34:56,155
I dragged her
all the way here from Miami

487
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,303
and broke her heart again.

488
00:34:58,937 --> 00:35:00,437
She'll understand...

489
00:35:00,884 --> 00:35:01,884
given...

490
00:35:04,208 --> 00:35:06,159
I didn't mean
all those things I said.

491
00:35:06,284 --> 00:35:08,330
I didn't know
what you were going through.

492
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:10,525
Do you really think you should be
smoking a cigar

493
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,700
given what your body
is trying to fight right now?

494
00:35:14,198 --> 00:35:17,281
This is not a cigar my friend.
This is pre-embargo,

495
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:19,893
hand rolled, cuban tobacco.

496
00:35:21,258 --> 00:35:23,093
This is an artifact.

497
00:35:26,636 --> 00:35:29,459
It's been sitting in a humidor in Miami
for over 40 years.

498
00:35:29,629 --> 00:35:31,783
I bought 2 of them
for a special occasion,

499
00:35:31,908 --> 00:35:34,021
like my wedding.
But under the circumstances,

500
00:35:34,146 --> 00:35:37,046
I think now's as good a time as any,
don't you?

501
00:35:38,009 --> 00:35:40,714
Look, there are
plenty of experimental treatments

502
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:42,973
and clinical trials
we can get you signed up for.

503
00:35:43,345 --> 00:35:44,997
There's the angiostatic approach.

504
00:35:45,122 --> 00:35:48,072
They use anaerobic bacteria
to attack the tumor.

505
00:35:48,985 --> 00:35:51,440
Cancer treatment's not
what it was when we were in school.

506
00:35:52,633 --> 00:35:55,033
Have a drink buddy boy.
You need one.

507
00:35:56,051 --> 00:35:57,851
Were you listening to me?!

508
00:35:58,254 --> 00:36:01,755
You can beat this thing.
You can get married again someday.

509
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,318
- You don't know.
- I've thought about all that shit!

510
00:36:04,443 --> 00:36:05,886
I mean, seriously.

511
00:36:07,393 --> 00:36:09,609
I don't want to spend
the last few months of my life

512
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:10,870
in hospitals.

513
00:36:11,479 --> 00:36:12,679
I just want...

514
00:36:13,474 --> 00:36:14,957
I want to celebrate every day.

515
00:36:15,082 --> 00:36:18,182
I want to get all my shit together
and I want to...

516
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:20,233
I want to enjoy myself.

517
00:36:28,082 --> 00:36:29,632
Will you sit with me?

518
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:47,752
You got to try one of these.
They're incredible.

519
00:37:14,862 --> 00:37:18,291
You didn't need to get married
to make sure you wouldn't be alone.

520
00:37:47,576 --> 00:37:50,276
Why'd you want
to bring me back here, Sean?

521
00:37:50,515 --> 00:37:52,712
So we can finish what we started.

522
00:37:53,153 --> 00:37:54,707
So even though it's dark,

523
00:37:54,832 --> 00:37:57,227
you can see
I'm willing to meet you half way.

524
00:37:58,127 --> 00:38:00,177
You aren't wearing underpants.

525
00:38:01,232 --> 00:38:02,741
You dirty boy.

526
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:06,912
Good evening. My name is jacqueline.
I'll be your waitress.

527
00:38:07,203 --> 00:38:10,370
- The amuse bouche this evening is...
- You know what, jacqueline,

528
00:38:10,495 --> 00:38:13,061
we're going to pass on the amuse bouche.
And actually...

529
00:38:13,186 --> 00:38:15,963
we want to be left alone for a while
and get used to the darkness.

530
00:38:16,088 --> 00:38:19,770
There's 200 bucks in it for you
if we don't hear you for 30 minutes.

531
00:38:19,895 --> 00:38:21,695
As you wish, mr. McNamara.

532
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:25,241
Get used to the darkness?

533
00:38:26,067 --> 00:38:27,167
I like that.

534
00:38:27,558 --> 00:38:29,358
And you'll like this, too.

535
00:38:41,846 --> 00:38:44,265
I'm glad to see
you taking it easy mr. Sabri.

536
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:46,365
No more long distance
treks across the room.

537
00:38:48,999 --> 00:38:50,399
Let's take a look.

538
00:38:53,322 --> 00:38:54,322
Good.

539
00:38:56,588 --> 00:38:59,638
Little thickening of the skin.
But so good so far.

540
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:04,221
You know, once we're
finished with these skin grafts,

541
00:39:04,346 --> 00:39:06,710
we'll have to talk
about dancing lessons.

542
00:39:06,835 --> 00:39:09,137
You do a lot of dancing
where you're from?

543
00:39:16,534 --> 00:39:18,434
When I woke up this morning,

544
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,590
I noticed them.

545
00:39:23,008 --> 00:39:25,263
They multiplied as the day went on.

546
00:39:27,066 --> 00:39:28,366
I had such hope.

547
00:39:44,672 --> 00:39:45,672
Me, too.

548
00:40:10,081 --> 00:40:12,331
Have you seen my non-fat blueberry?

549
00:40:12,738 --> 00:40:13,938
I'm eating it.

550
00:40:19,696 --> 00:40:21,625
We're gonna have
to start labeling things.

551
00:40:22,832 --> 00:40:24,312
Does that mean you're staying?

552
00:40:24,437 --> 00:40:27,337
I'm not going to have
a long distance marriage.

553
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:34,040
So why the change of heart?

554
00:40:35,315 --> 00:40:39,293
Well, I figure I'm gonna have
to take care of your sorry ass anyways.

555
00:40:39,418 --> 00:40:43,065
So I might as well get
a big honking diamond ring out of it.

556
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:44,630


557
00:40:44,755 --> 00:40:48,355
There's not one lesbian I know
who could afford one that big.

558
00:40:49,376 --> 00:40:51,747
- You don't have to do this.
- I know.

559
00:40:54,598 --> 00:40:56,330
But you know like they say,

560
00:40:56,455 --> 00:40:58,663
for better or for worse.

561
00:41:06,434 --> 00:41:09,586
I know you better
than you know yourself, Christian.

562
00:41:12,665 --> 00:41:14,387
And I'm not gonna let you die alone.

563
00:41:17,563 --> 00:41:18,961
Look at it this way.

564
00:41:19,086 --> 00:41:21,395
I'll be dead
before we can get divorced.

565
00:41:26,624 --> 00:41:30,074
We have a meeting with a wedding planner
tomorrow at 9:00.

566
00:41:30,398 --> 00:41:31,798
Don't you be late.

567
00:41:36,062 --> 00:41:37,062
Nice ass.

568
00:41:40,303 --> 00:41:41,753
And it's all yours.
