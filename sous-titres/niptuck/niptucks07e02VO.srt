1
00:00:18,286 --> 00:00:20,739
I woke up I didn't know
where I was.

2
00:00:21,486 --> 00:00:23,255
Didn't know who I was.

3
00:00:25,402 --> 00:00:28,639
Couldn't believe I'd slept
through most of my life.

4
00:00:29,591 --> 00:00:33,046
I'd been unconscious
for 22 years.

5
00:00:33,685 --> 00:00:36,439
Since 1989.
I was 18.

6
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:40,643
And the accident happened
at a construction site, is that right?

7
00:00:40,763 --> 00:00:44,328
Yes, it was a summer job.
I was installing a church steeple.

8
00:00:45,026 --> 00:00:46,536
A crane collapsed.

9
00:00:46,656 --> 00:00:48,686
I don't even remember it
hitting me.

10
00:00:48,806 --> 00:00:51,447
One second, it was
a beautiful day, the next,

11
00:00:51,936 --> 00:00:53,356
lights out.

12
00:00:53,424 --> 00:00:56,731
And what exactly is it
that brought you here? What...

13
00:00:57,103 --> 00:00:58,916
don't you like
about yourself?

14
00:00:58,984 --> 00:01:00,524
Jesus, man,
look at me.

15
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:02,096
I'm ancient!

16
00:01:02,808 --> 00:01:06,537
Even though my body
was alive for 40 years,

17
00:01:06,657 --> 00:01:08,523
I was only awake for 18.

18
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,822
And you want to look like
an 18 year old again?

19
00:01:11,942 --> 00:01:13,678
I am an 18 year old!

20
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:17,606
I had plans before
I went in the coma.

21
00:01:17,726 --> 00:01:19,972
I was gonna go to college.
I was gonna...

22
00:01:20,306 --> 00:01:22,342
meet a girl,
have a family.

23
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:24,079
Have a career.

24
00:01:24,199 --> 00:01:25,231
Mr. Kenny...

25
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:26,658
See, that's...

26
00:01:26,725 --> 00:01:29,902
I'm a mister.
I'm a mister now.

27
00:01:32,437 --> 00:01:34,211
I look in the mirror

28
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:38,383
and I see this old man looking
back at me. And I'm like...

29
00:01:38,784 --> 00:01:40,334
"who are you?

30
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:43,256
Who put me in your body?"

31
00:01:44,724 --> 00:01:48,179
I need you to make
the outside match the inside.

32
00:01:49,548 --> 00:01:52,979
You can give me a chance
to live all those years that I lost

33
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:55,519
for the first time,
fully awake.

34
00:01:56,214 --> 00:01:58,873
You can give me back my life.

40
00:03:31,974 --> 00:03:33,773
Why aren't you getting ready?

41
00:03:33,893 --> 00:03:34,986
Ready?
For what?

42
00:03:35,106 --> 00:03:38,041
I have a meet and greet
at the pacific design center tonight.

43
00:03:38,161 --> 00:03:41,072
I told you this a week ago,
you don't remember?

44
00:03:42,663 --> 00:03:46,431
Christian, this is really important.
I need to make contacts tonight,

45
00:03:46,551 --> 00:03:49,722
and I had all of these
business cards made.

46
00:03:51,846 --> 00:03:54,029
"Over 15 years experience."

47
00:03:54,149 --> 00:03:55,180
In what?

48
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,766
Well, I had a life before
you and I met.

49
00:03:57,886 --> 00:04:00,010
I designed all
my own movie sets.

50
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,321
Oh. Ok.

51
00:04:02,602 --> 00:04:05,987
Well, you haven't exactly thanked me
for what I've done here.

52
00:04:06,107 --> 00:04:08,427
Can't imagine how that
slipped my mind.

53
00:04:09,297 --> 00:04:12,505
Look, I know it takes
a little bit of getting used to,

54
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,905
but in the overcrowded
markets in L.A.,

55
00:04:15,025 --> 00:04:17,502
you need to make
bold style choices.

56
00:04:18,804 --> 00:04:20,266
And speaking of style,

57
00:04:20,386 --> 00:04:23,521
could you please get up off
the couch and go get dressed?

58
00:04:24,789 --> 00:04:27,463
This is the third time you tried
to drag me out this week, all right?

59
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:30,200
I didn't get married so that
you could get me in a suit

60
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,088
and have me rub elbows
with the great unwashed.

61
00:04:37,983 --> 00:04:39,030
All right.

62
00:04:39,515 --> 00:04:42,903
Look, I got the house,
the job, the beautiful wife.

63
00:04:43,023 --> 00:04:45,267
Just let me relax
and enjoy my life.

64
00:04:48,027 --> 00:04:48,945
Ok.

65
00:04:55,643 --> 00:04:58,556
Awesome ballgame last night.
You get to catch it?

66
00:04:58,929 --> 00:05:00,698
- Is that you?
- Huh?

67
00:05:00,981 --> 00:05:02,259
You stink.

68
00:05:02,693 --> 00:05:04,088
And you look like shit.

69
00:05:04,156 --> 00:05:05,289
Thank you.

70
00:05:05,357 --> 00:05:08,081
You know how long it took me
to get ready this morning?

71
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:09,138
3 minutes.

72
00:05:09,258 --> 00:05:11,854
Got to catch sportscenter
for the first time in months,

73
00:05:11,974 --> 00:05:13,419
didn't cut myself shaving,

74
00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:16,245
didn't have to swing by the dry
cleaners on my way to the office.

75
00:05:16,365 --> 00:05:17,764
Yeah, maybe you should have.

76
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:20,840
I am done getting up at 6:00
every day, getting ready for work.

77
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,395
Shower, shave,
do the hair, press the suit.

78
00:05:23,515 --> 00:05:25,764
All that bullshit's hard on a man.

79
00:05:26,142 --> 00:05:28,025
Why are you looking
at that thing, by the way?

80
00:05:28,145 --> 00:05:29,320
Trying to find a bed.

81
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,337
Only have a mattress
on the floor right now.

82
00:05:31,457 --> 00:05:34,515
A man over thirty should never buy
anything that he has to put together,

83
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:36,622
particularly
from the swedes.

84
00:05:37,874 --> 00:05:40,442
Julia used to buy
our furniture.

85
00:05:40,562 --> 00:05:42,678
Never really had
to do this before.

86
00:05:42,798 --> 00:05:44,627
Never had my own
place until now.

87
00:05:44,747 --> 00:05:46,133
Ha, call my wife.

88
00:05:46,253 --> 00:05:48,836
She apparently is
an interior designer now.

89
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,520
- Kimber?
- Matter of fact...

90
00:05:54,093 --> 00:05:56,326
You'd be doing me
a huge favor.

91
00:05:56,446 --> 00:05:58,702
She's being a real pain
in the ass.

92
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,453
Do you mind
giving her a buzz? Huh?

93
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,781
Excuse me. I've been
waiting for a half hour.

94
00:06:16,901 --> 00:06:18,141
Should I reschedule?

95
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:21,338
I told you already, we'll be
with you as soon as we can.

96
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:23,859
- Hi.
- Hi.

97
00:06:24,226 --> 00:06:26,313
Sorry to keep you waiting,
Mrs., um...

98
00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:27,362
- Banks.
- Banks.

99
00:06:27,482 --> 00:06:29,665
- Willow Banks.
- Willow Banks. Wow.

100
00:06:29,785 --> 00:06:31,637
Beautiful.
Dr. Christian Troy.

101
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:34,405
You a model?

102
00:06:34,525 --> 00:06:35,922
- I was.
- Great.

103
00:06:36,637 --> 00:06:38,303
I'd like to apologize
for the receptionist.

104
00:06:38,423 --> 00:06:39,955
She can be a real
bitch sometimes.

105
00:06:40,075 --> 00:06:42,545
- Dr. Troy...
- Do it again, you're fired.

106
00:06:45,207 --> 00:06:46,182
Shall we?

107
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,127
Yeah.

108
00:06:48,364 --> 00:06:50,684
Please don't fire her
on my account.

109
00:06:50,804 --> 00:06:52,854
Women always seem
to treat me like that.

110
00:06:52,922 --> 00:06:54,756
Maybe I'll give her a raise.

111
00:07:02,231 --> 00:07:07,512
Maybe I should bang the shit
out of you right here on this desk.

112
00:07:10,614 --> 00:07:11,649
Dr. Troy?

113
00:07:14,253 --> 00:07:16,224
Dr. Troy?
Excuse me?

114
00:07:16,923 --> 00:07:19,027
Yes.
So...

115
00:07:20,587 --> 00:07:23,214
What can I do for you,
Ms. Banks?

116
00:07:23,592 --> 00:07:25,759
I'd ask you what you
don't like about yourself,

117
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,817
but you look
pretty good to me.

118
00:07:28,084 --> 00:07:29,904
Well,
that's exactly the problem.

119
00:07:30,024 --> 00:07:30,924
Right.

120
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:34,242
I'm tired of all the attention I get
because of the way I look.

121
00:07:34,362 --> 00:07:38,055
I'm tired of every guy I meet either
being too intimidated to talk to me,

122
00:07:38,175 --> 00:07:41,032
or think that he can just
stroll up and ask me out.

123
00:07:41,152 --> 00:07:43,601
I can't tell you how many
times a guy has tried...

124
00:07:43,721 --> 00:07:47,056
some cheesy pick-up line or
howled like a dog as I walk by.

125
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:49,885
I mean, is it too much to ask
for just a little conversation

126
00:07:50,005 --> 00:07:52,589
before telling me that
you're envisioning me naked?

127
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:54,993
And I'm tired of not
having any girlfriends

128
00:07:55,113 --> 00:07:57,684
because they think
I make them look bad.

129
00:07:58,301 --> 00:07:59,370
I just...

130
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:01,955
I can't be perfect anymore.

131
00:08:02,923 --> 00:08:04,672
I want to be unperfect.

132
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:05,931
Unperfect?

133
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:07,817
Yeah.

134
00:08:10,635 --> 00:08:13,439
Well, that's the stupidest thing
I ever heard.

135
00:08:14,123 --> 00:08:16,321
People come in here every day
asking for what you have.

136
00:08:16,441 --> 00:08:18,558
- They want your face.
- Well, I don't.

137
00:08:18,678 --> 00:08:20,126
Not any longer.

138
00:08:20,246 --> 00:08:22,663
It's just too much pressure,
Dr. Troy.

139
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,503
I feel like I'm onstage
all the time.

140
00:08:25,904 --> 00:08:28,451
I even quit modeling,
and that hasn't helped.

141
00:08:29,068 --> 00:08:31,732
Look, for once in my life,
I just want to be able to...

142
00:08:31,852 --> 00:08:34,178
walk down the street
and be ignored.

143
00:08:34,592 --> 00:08:37,118
I want to be normal looking.
I want to be average.

144
00:08:37,238 --> 00:08:39,035
What about putting on
a couple of pounds?

145
00:08:39,155 --> 00:08:40,812
A double cheeseburger,
something like that.

146
00:08:40,932 --> 00:08:42,813
- I don't eat red meat.
- Ice cream.

147
00:08:42,933 --> 00:08:45,236
- I'm lactose intolerant.
- Jesus.

148
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,756
You know what
I'm talking about. Just...

149
00:08:47,876 --> 00:08:50,846
Just take worse care
of yourself. Like some nuts?

150
00:08:50,966 --> 00:08:53,015
- No, thanks.
- Come on, you might enjoy it.

151
00:08:53,135 --> 00:08:55,884
Look, I said I wanted to be
unbeautiful, not unhealthy.

152
00:08:56,004 --> 00:08:56,678
Ok.

153
00:08:56,798 --> 00:08:59,379
And I have tried to make
superficial changes.

154
00:08:59,687 --> 00:09:01,042
I'm not wearing any make-up,

155
00:09:01,162 --> 00:09:03,138
I haven't washed my hair
in like a week.

156
00:09:03,258 --> 00:09:05,690
I mean, look at what I'm
wearing, for Christ sakes.

157
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:08,649
And still, your parking valet
gave me his phone number.

158
00:09:08,769 --> 00:09:09,487
Well,

159
00:09:09,921 --> 00:09:11,656
you'll just have
to try a little harder,

160
00:09:11,776 --> 00:09:13,271
because looking
the way you look,

161
00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:15,008
I would never touch you
with a scalpel.

162
00:09:15,128 --> 00:09:17,698
And good luck finding
a doctor who would.

163
00:09:34,068 --> 00:09:35,337
- Hey.
- Hey.

164
00:09:35,457 --> 00:09:38,087
Oh, hello. Do you want
me to come back?

165
00:09:38,207 --> 00:09:39,659
No, no, no.
Come in, come in.

166
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,835
- You sure?
- I just got a little carried away.

167
00:09:41,955 --> 00:09:43,610
- Working out?
- Yeah.

168
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,339
It's kind of a metaphor
for my life these days.

169
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:48,549
- You want some water?
- Oh, no, thanks. I'm good.

170
00:09:48,669 --> 00:09:50,672
I just keep
running and running

171
00:09:50,792 --> 00:09:52,651
without a clue
where I'm going.

172
00:09:52,771 --> 00:09:55,825
Well, at least you care about
your health and your body.

173
00:09:55,945 --> 00:09:58,012
Christian's at home laying
on the couch drinking beer

174
00:09:58,132 --> 00:10:00,515
like a fat slob.
Seems he's given up.

175
00:10:00,635 --> 00:10:03,359
Well, maybe that's his way
of saying he's happy.

176
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:07,788
Or maybe it's his way of telling me
he doesn't care what I think.

177
00:10:08,699 --> 00:10:11,392
Well, he is proud of you,
Kimber.

178
00:10:12,049 --> 00:10:13,184
I suppose.

179
00:10:13,968 --> 00:10:17,483
Well, ok. I hope you like
what I put together.

180
00:10:17,603 --> 00:10:19,837
- Do you mind?
- No, no. Yeah, yeah.

181
00:10:21,623 --> 00:10:22,725
First one.

182
00:10:23,226 --> 00:10:24,512
Oh.
Now, see,...

183
00:10:24,632 --> 00:10:28,668
this is a little more Christian
than me, don't you think?

184
00:10:29,602 --> 00:10:30,653
All right.

185
00:10:32,222 --> 00:10:34,301
Well,
what are your tastes?

186
00:10:34,421 --> 00:10:37,513
Like, how would you
describe Sean McNamara?

187
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,560
Well, how would I know?
I'm just a doctor.

188
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,312
Well, you're more than that.

189
00:10:42,432 --> 00:10:47,165
What about like an artsy,
intellectual, mid-century type of guy?

190
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:55,944
Or you could do kind of a homey,
kick-back, country French look?

191
00:10:56,064 --> 00:10:57,656
Look, do I need
to go to therapy

192
00:10:57,776 --> 00:10:59,542
just to get some furniture
for this place?

193
00:10:59,662 --> 00:11:01,267
That's why I hired you.

194
00:11:02,035 --> 00:11:03,353
No, it's just,

195
00:11:03,473 --> 00:11:06,821
in design school, they really
emphasize on listening to the client.

196
00:11:06,941 --> 00:11:09,322
You know, like your likes,
dislikes, colors.

197
00:11:09,442 --> 00:11:12,728
Yeah, well, this particular
client has no self.

198
00:11:13,114 --> 00:11:15,454
It seems he's arrived
in his 45th year

199
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:17,907
with no opinions
or taste of his own.

200
00:11:18,027 --> 00:11:20,769
He spent too much time in
everyone else's shadow.

201
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:23,450
Kimber, just...
do your thing.

202
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,191
You know,
whatever you think.

203
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:28,030
Let your imagination go,
you have my permission.

204
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,719
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

205
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:35,268
Ok. Well, I think I can do
something in here.

206
00:11:38,772 --> 00:11:39,921
Thank you.

207
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,191
I promise you,

208
00:11:41,311 --> 00:11:43,852
I'm going to blow you
away with this place, ok?

209
00:11:43,972 --> 00:11:45,702
I have total faith in you.

210
00:11:46,286 --> 00:11:48,291
Thanks.
I'll see you later.

211
00:11:48,411 --> 00:11:49,585
- Ok.
- Bye.

212
00:11:49,705 --> 00:11:50,454
Bye.

213
00:11:50,574 --> 00:11:52,072
- See ya.
- See ya.

214
00:12:07,865 --> 00:12:09,332
It really is a miracle.

215
00:12:09,452 --> 00:12:11,900
Oh, absolutely.
99% of comas

216
00:12:11,968 --> 00:12:14,541
that last more than
three years are permanent.

217
00:12:14,661 --> 00:12:17,944
No, I mean because he can
steal $40,000 from us just...

218
00:12:18,064 --> 00:12:20,261
lying on this table.
It's... it's miraculous.

219
00:12:20,381 --> 00:12:22,971
This is not a typical
pro-Bono case.

220
00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:25,925
The wear and tear on his face

221
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:29,355
is completely out of the norm
because of his prone position.

222
00:12:29,722 --> 00:12:33,263
Ok, we're doing a rhytidectomy
with an SMAS asplication.

223
00:12:33,549 --> 00:12:34,549
You're right.

224
00:12:34,616 --> 00:12:37,344
We can now corner the market
on rip van winkles.

225
00:12:38,929 --> 00:12:40,353
Very impressive.

226
00:12:40,812 --> 00:12:42,225
Made up a lot
of new expenses.

227
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:44,160
You know, I'm just trying
to be responsible.

228
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,579
At this point in my life,

229
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:47,606
I'm not compromising
on work I find...

230
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:50,610
interesting and rewarding
so you can have new toys.

231
00:12:50,891 --> 00:12:52,914
I don't know why
you're worried about money.

232
00:12:53,034 --> 00:12:54,597
I just got Kimber's first bill.

233
00:12:54,664 --> 00:12:57,380
Well, unlike Mr. Kenny,
you're not a charity case, ok?

234
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,574
Did you think she was going
to work for free?

235
00:12:59,694 --> 00:13:02,843
There's a difference between
pro-bono and bleeding me dry.

236
00:13:03,227 --> 00:13:06,843
I'm her first client, and I only
hired her as a favor to you.

237
00:13:06,963 --> 00:13:09,953
You know, if I had have known
you'd be such a pain in the ass,

238
00:13:10,073 --> 00:13:12,573
I never would have suggested it
in the first place.

239
00:13:12,693 --> 00:13:13,861
You know what?

240
00:13:14,128 --> 00:13:15,669
Why don't you just leave?

241
00:13:16,621 --> 00:13:18,365
I'd like to finish this
on my own.

242
00:13:18,485 --> 00:13:19,550
Are you serious?

243
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,877
I'm tired of the witty banter
and the back and forth

244
00:13:21,997 --> 00:13:24,481
and you telling me all the ways
I'm making your life more difficult.

245
00:13:24,601 --> 00:13:25,634
If you don't mind,

246
00:13:25,754 --> 00:13:28,455
I'd like to spend some time
focusing on my work.

247
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,958
Are you serious?

248
00:13:31,392 --> 00:13:32,350
Yes.

249
00:13:37,965 --> 00:13:38,987
Fine.

250
00:13:52,556 --> 00:13:53,289
Jesus!

251
00:13:53,356 --> 00:13:55,880
Wait a second, don't push it.
It's gonna get dirty.

252
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,319
Don't tell me you're redoing
the living room again.

253
00:13:58,439 --> 00:14:00,259
No, no, this is for Sean.

254
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:02,228
I have to go there
later and finish.

255
00:14:02,348 --> 00:14:03,922
I thought we were
going to stay home

256
00:14:04,042 --> 00:14:05,689
and watch some
television together.

257
00:14:05,809 --> 00:14:07,722
Honey, I told you,
I have a client deadline.

258
00:14:07,842 --> 00:14:09,166
Client?

259
00:14:09,234 --> 00:14:11,277
He's not a client,
he's Sean.

260
00:14:11,561 --> 00:14:13,409
The only reason
he gave you the job

261
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:16,149
was because I asked him to
in the first place.

262
00:14:16,693 --> 00:14:18,963
Well, that's not
what he told me.

263
00:14:24,783 --> 00:14:27,249
Damn it, I can't find
the swatches.

264
00:14:28,465 --> 00:14:31,884
Christian, why do you have
to ruin everything for me?

265
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:34,369
Look, I told Sean to call you
before you got booked up,

266
00:14:34,489 --> 00:14:35,857
that's all, all right?

267
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,399
This is exactly what I was
worried about, by the way.

268
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,955
I mean, you working again was
supposed to make you feel happy,

269
00:14:42,075 --> 00:14:43,382
not miserable.

270
00:14:43,502 --> 00:14:46,436
Now you feel miserable
and I feel miserable, and...

271
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:49,595
It's not good.

272
00:14:52,062 --> 00:14:55,567
Maybe we should spend
more time together or something.

273
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:58,600
And how are we going to
spend time together...

274
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,956
with that giant gut of
yours in between us?

275
00:15:01,076 --> 00:15:02,091
What?

276
00:15:05,073 --> 00:15:06,409
I have a gut?

277
00:15:06,776 --> 00:15:08,836
And that stubble
you've got going on?

278
00:15:08,956 --> 00:15:11,159
You think I like that
rubbing in between my legs?

279
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,695
I thought you liked
the beard.

280
00:15:12,815 --> 00:15:14,662
I'm not talking about
your beard, Christian.

281
00:15:14,782 --> 00:15:17,527
I'm talking about your balls.
You used to shave them for me.

282
00:15:17,647 --> 00:15:19,091
Now I'm lucky...

283
00:15:19,158 --> 00:15:21,682
if you even run a comb
through your hair

284
00:15:21,802 --> 00:15:24,088
before you leave the house.

285
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,650
This whole new
Christian look...

286
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:29,653
isn't exactly
working for me.

287
00:15:29,773 --> 00:15:31,864
So maybe if you could
rediscover a brush, or,

288
00:15:31,984 --> 00:15:33,797
I don't know,
maybe a razor...

289
00:15:33,917 --> 00:15:36,723
Until then, you're not
doing me either, ok?

290
00:15:38,368 --> 00:15:42,352
Oh, don't wait up for me,
'cause I'm gonna be late.

291
00:15:56,199 --> 00:15:57,585
You look good.

292
00:16:00,272 --> 00:16:01,685
Sorry.
I, uh...

293
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:04,296
Linda gave me this,
and...

294
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,650
I used to think
the walkman was cool.

295
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:07,993
Have a seat.

296
00:16:08,627 --> 00:16:10,323
I want a last little look,

297
00:16:10,443 --> 00:16:13,369
send you on your way
with a clean bill of health.

298
00:16:14,211 --> 00:16:16,114
My mom started crying
when she looked at me.

299
00:16:16,234 --> 00:16:18,654
She said looking at me made
her feel 20 years younger.

300
00:16:18,774 --> 00:16:21,151
Well,
I don't know about 20.

301
00:16:21,702 --> 00:16:24,373
But we definitely
chopped off at least 10.

302
00:16:24,807 --> 00:16:25,525
So,

303
00:16:26,092 --> 00:16:27,941
what's next
on your agenda?

304
00:16:28,061 --> 00:16:29,699
It's all pretty weird.

305
00:16:30,133 --> 00:16:34,389
All my friends have grown and
have families and careers, and...

306
00:16:34,509 --> 00:16:36,425
a lot of them have
moved away.

307
00:16:36,545 --> 00:16:39,226
So... I really want to meet
someone my own age.

308
00:16:39,346 --> 00:16:42,619
Early twenties, maybe.
I don't want to aim too high.

309
00:16:42,739 --> 00:16:45,544
But I figured I'd go
to the clubs and...

310
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:49,550
see if I was any better
of a dancer than I used to be.

311
00:16:50,568 --> 00:16:51,766
Any suggestions?

312
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:53,502
No, not really.

313
00:16:53,622 --> 00:16:56,140
I travel in a slightly
older circle.

314
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:04,104
- Best of luck, though.
- Thank  you.

315
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,002
I feel like a freak.

316
00:17:09,938 --> 00:17:13,238
I have no idea
what girls like today.

317
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:17,578
You know, texting,
cell phones, Google.

318
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:19,735
It's all pretty...

319
00:17:20,853 --> 00:17:22,305
Nerve wracking.

320
00:17:22,425 --> 00:17:25,320
Well, it's kind of like riding a bike.
I'm sure you'll be fine.

321
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,490
Except I've never
ridden a bike.

322
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,025
So to speak.

323
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,774
- So you're...
- Yeah.

324
00:17:31,894 --> 00:17:33,379
A 40-year-old virgin.

325
00:17:35,446 --> 00:17:38,621
Could have been worse.
Could have died one.

326
00:17:39,113 --> 00:17:41,400
I know a place
that you might like.

327
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,345
They even let
old guys like me in.

328
00:17:48,453 --> 00:17:50,336
- Oh. Hi.
- Hi.

329
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,449
Did you come find me

330
00:17:53,569 --> 00:17:56,119
to tell me that you changed
your mind about my surgery, or...

331
00:17:56,239 --> 00:17:57,471
No, actually,
I came...

332
00:17:57,591 --> 00:17:59,273
to change your mind
about the surgery.

333
00:17:59,393 --> 00:18:00,692
That won't happen.

334
00:18:00,812 --> 00:18:02,438
I already have
two more appointments

335
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:04,606
with plastic surgeons
next week, Dr. Troy. So...

336
00:18:04,726 --> 00:18:06,472
You can call me Christian.

337
00:18:06,592 --> 00:18:08,782
I'm not here
as your doctor.

338
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:11,910
You do like wine,
don't you?

339
00:18:13,196 --> 00:18:15,545
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Well, this is, uh...

340
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:19,667
really nice. Goes perfectly
with the colonel's

341
00:18:20,354 --> 00:18:21,794
special recipe.

342
00:18:21,914 --> 00:18:23,963
I've already eaten,
but thank you.

343
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:27,145
Oh, ok. Well,
that's more for me.

344
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,672
What are you doing?

345
00:18:31,991 --> 00:18:33,472
You know, it's
Saturday night.

346
00:18:33,592 --> 00:18:34,751
How do you know
I'm not going out?

347
00:18:34,871 --> 00:18:36,494
You don't like
aggressive men, and...

348
00:18:36,561 --> 00:18:38,354
there's more aggressive
and drunk men out...

349
00:18:38,474 --> 00:18:40,713
on a Saturday night than
any other night of the week.

350
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:43,482
So why don't you do us both
a favor, just quit your yappin',

351
00:18:43,602 --> 00:18:45,429
grab a couple of glasses
and a corkscrew,

352
00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:47,753
and come sit your little ass
down on the couch.

353
00:18:47,873 --> 00:18:50,608
Seems like I don't have to go
out to find an aggressive man.

354
00:18:50,676 --> 00:18:53,436
Ok.
Come to papa.

355
00:19:03,613 --> 00:19:07,334
I don't think I've had fried chicken
since I was in, like, high school.

356
00:19:09,084 --> 00:19:10,719
But at least you're
removing the skin.

357
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:14,833
- That's where all the fat is.
- That's where all the taste is.

358
00:19:16,899 --> 00:19:17,891
Ok.

359
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:31,326
Are you sure you don't want
to try some of this?

360
00:19:31,446 --> 00:19:32,498
Yeah, no.

361
00:19:35,311 --> 00:19:36,162
Ok.

362
00:19:36,773 --> 00:19:38,215
Give me one of those.

363
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:56,997
The music's pretty cool.

364
00:19:57,662 --> 00:19:58,660
Who is this?

365
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,062
To tell you the truth,

366
00:20:00,182 --> 00:20:03,265
I think the last time I bought
a cd, you were still awake.

367
00:20:03,385 --> 00:20:05,732
I'm mostly into pop music
from the late eighties.

368
00:20:05,852 --> 00:20:07,361
You know,
Phil Collins,

369
00:20:07,429 --> 00:20:09,919
Richard Marx.
There was an innocence to it.

370
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:11,364
It sucked.

371
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:14,540
The girls dress
a lot better now, though.

372
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,401
Yeah.

373
00:20:16,927 --> 00:20:19,513
You woke up
at just the right time.

374
00:20:19,633 --> 00:20:21,833
This is the slut generation.

375
00:20:22,178 --> 00:20:23,647
Most of these girls,

376
00:20:23,767 --> 00:20:26,701
their role models are famous
for having sex tapes.

377
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:30,785
My partner's really
the expert in these places.

378
00:20:32,103 --> 00:20:34,440
Well,
what would you do now?

379
00:20:41,883 --> 00:20:42,684
Hi.

380
00:20:43,631 --> 00:20:46,652
I'm Dr. Sean McNamara.
I'm a plastic surgeon.

381
00:20:47,053 --> 00:20:48,789
Are you guys narcs?

382
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,339
What do we do now?

383
00:20:55,459 --> 00:20:56,868
Now we get drunk.

384
00:20:57,629 --> 00:20:58,508
Tequila.

385
00:20:58,976 --> 00:21:00,294
Best you have.

386
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:10,525
Tomorrow, I'm introducing you
to a triple stuft burrito with sour cream.

387
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:13,406
I think we should buy
a KFC franchise together.

388
00:21:13,907 --> 00:21:16,691
Settle down
somewhere like... Fresno.

389
00:21:16,992 --> 00:21:18,894
And never be heard
from again.

390
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,145
Sounds good.

391
00:21:22,075 --> 00:21:23,674
Fat and happy ever after.

392
00:21:23,794 --> 00:21:25,988
Fat and happy.
And ugly.

393
00:21:41,561 --> 00:21:43,926
Wait a second.
I have an idea.

394
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:01,696
You better not be puking
your guts out in there.

395
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,750
You don't have
anything sweet, do you?

396
00:22:16,471 --> 00:22:18,107
So what do you think?

397
00:22:22,667 --> 00:22:24,503
Holy shit.

398
00:22:25,905 --> 00:22:27,997
Yeah.
I can't believe I did it.

399
00:22:28,117 --> 00:22:29,460
But I did it.

400
00:22:30,629 --> 00:22:32,181
It worked.

401
00:22:33,532 --> 00:22:34,864
I'm ugly, right?

402
00:22:34,984 --> 00:22:35,984
You're, um,

403
00:22:36,946 --> 00:22:38,204
impulsive.

404
00:22:40,204 --> 00:22:42,458
Which is very hot.

405
00:23:18,077 --> 00:23:20,147
This place is awesome!

406
00:23:23,051 --> 00:23:25,120
Hey, how are you doing?

407
00:23:51,557 --> 00:23:52,375
Hey.

408
00:23:53,491 --> 00:23:55,711
I gotta...
I gotta get out of here.

409
00:23:56,512 --> 00:23:58,482
You stay,
I'm gonna go.

410
00:24:27,149 --> 00:24:28,651
What the hell...

411
00:24:33,154 --> 00:24:34,155
Oh, hey.

412
00:24:34,275 --> 00:24:36,238
Oh, I didn't know
you'd still be here.

413
00:24:36,358 --> 00:24:38,811
Oh, well, it took a lot longer
than I thought it was going to.

414
00:24:38,931 --> 00:24:40,847
Actually,
the movers just left.

415
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:43,217
So what do you think?

416
00:24:46,616 --> 00:24:48,030
Oh, you hate it.

417
00:24:50,328 --> 00:24:51,987
This is how you see me?

418
00:24:52,585 --> 00:24:56,327
Well, old-fashioned gentleman
with a hint of...

419
00:24:56,677 --> 00:24:59,220
old-world glamour,
yeah.

420
00:25:00,139 --> 00:25:02,909
Old-fashioned.
Old world. Old...

421
00:25:03,193 --> 00:25:05,084
pretty much says it,
right?

422
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:06,269
Sean...

423
00:25:07,502 --> 00:25:09,050
Think of Clark Gable.

424
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:11,580
Or Rudolph Valentino.

425
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:13,478
If those guys had
a bachelor pad,

426
00:25:13,598 --> 00:25:15,764
they'd totally decorate it
like this.

427
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:21,418
All right, you hate it.

428
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:29,708
I'm sorry if it's not
what you wanted.

429
00:25:30,326 --> 00:25:32,352
I just wanted
to make you feel...

430
00:25:32,472 --> 00:25:33,747
special.

431
00:25:43,714 --> 00:25:44,982
Kimber...

432
00:25:46,035 --> 00:25:48,610
So caught up in myself,
I wasn't thinking.

433
00:25:50,944 --> 00:25:51,894
You know,

434
00:25:52,014 --> 00:25:55,182
now that I'm really looking at it,
it is pretty great.

435
00:25:56,249 --> 00:25:57,568
You got me,

436
00:25:57,982 --> 00:25:59,841
or somebody
I'd like to be.

437
00:26:00,289 --> 00:26:01,791
Yeah, now
you're just saying that.

438
00:26:01,911 --> 00:26:02,935
No, no, no.
Hey.

439
00:26:03,055 --> 00:26:06,671
It's completely different from anything
I could have imagined. But...

440
00:26:06,971 --> 00:26:08,226
strangely...

441
00:26:08,683 --> 00:26:09,561
right.

442
00:26:10,693 --> 00:26:12,963
I think I'll like
coming home to this.

443
00:26:13,423 --> 00:26:14,958
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

444
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:18,326
Oh, that's great.
Oh, Sean, thank you.

445
00:26:22,921 --> 00:26:27,292
My God, you have no idea
how hard I have worked on this.

446
00:26:27,412 --> 00:26:29,395
Well, you are talented,
Kimber.

447
00:26:30,178 --> 00:26:33,429
Well, tell that to Christian.
He hates how I redid the house.

448
00:26:33,549 --> 00:26:34,876
Our house, whatever.

449
00:26:34,996 --> 00:26:36,319
Well, he can be tough.

450
00:26:36,387 --> 00:26:38,658
I'm terrified of making
mistakes, right?

451
00:26:38,778 --> 00:26:41,846
Like, I completely
lose my instincts.

452
00:26:41,966 --> 00:26:43,603
I don't know who he is.

453
00:26:43,723 --> 00:26:45,710
I don't know who I am, or...

454
00:26:46,224 --> 00:26:49,412
Us as a couple.
It's just so frustrating.

455
00:26:49,684 --> 00:26:53,186
But thanks for being sweet and
making me feel confident.

456
00:26:53,306 --> 00:26:54,708
Doesn't take much.

457
00:26:55,009 --> 00:26:57,617
A little sunshine,
a little watering.

458
00:26:58,768 --> 00:27:00,221
Look what you did.

459
00:27:01,022 --> 00:27:02,006
Well...

460
00:27:06,921 --> 00:27:09,521
You know,
I did the library back there,

461
00:27:09,641 --> 00:27:13,586
and it has this beautiful,
dark carved wood...

462
00:27:17,911 --> 00:27:19,880
Show me the bedroom first.

463
00:27:33,344 --> 00:27:36,178
I came here to tell you that
we can't do this again!

464
00:27:36,298 --> 00:27:38,626
Oh, yeah, we can't do this
anymore, you're right.

465
00:27:38,746 --> 00:27:41,652
I mean, like, we're bad.
Like, this is really bad.

466
00:27:41,772 --> 00:27:43,237
I know.
And the worst.

467
00:27:43,357 --> 00:27:45,504
How come
I don't feel guilty?

468
00:27:51,221 --> 00:27:53,077
Is that him?
Is that Christian?

469
00:27:53,197 --> 00:27:55,770
Yeah. We're only
separated by this wall.

470
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:57,939
Oh, I like it.

471
00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:05,255
Not even fast food?

472
00:28:05,906 --> 00:28:06,999
You gotta eat.

473
00:28:07,067 --> 00:28:08,610
No I need to go surgery.

474
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,546
I'll have you back in a flash.

475
00:28:10,666 --> 00:28:11,647
A flash?

476
00:28:12,435 --> 00:28:13,365
Come on.

477
00:28:13,485 --> 00:28:18,152
Big old burrito smothered
in guacamole and sour cream.

478
00:28:19,887 --> 00:28:21,322
- Ok.
- Yeah?

479
00:28:21,442 --> 00:28:24,666
Pull the car out front.
Meet you downstairs.

480
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:40,310
Sean, who the hell you
banging in there?

481
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:43,613
Oh, just your wife,
sweetheart.

482
00:28:43,733 --> 00:28:45,232
Hey, what's up?

483
00:28:48,712 --> 00:28:50,098
What the hell
are you doing here?

484
00:28:50,218 --> 00:28:52,255
Well, she's doing such
a good job on the apartment,

485
00:28:52,375 --> 00:28:54,201
I wanted to ask her advice
on a new desk.

486
00:28:54,321 --> 00:28:55,490
Tired of glass.

487
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:57,543
I want to warm it up in here.

488
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,245
Why was it locked?

489
00:28:59,365 --> 00:29:01,778
Um, oh, I had just
mentioned to Sean

490
00:29:01,898 --> 00:29:04,821
about the new brush
nickel door hardware,

491
00:29:04,941 --> 00:29:07,531
and so I must have just,
you know, hit the button.

492
00:29:07,651 --> 00:29:08,743
Brush nickel?

493
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,786
Look, no changes
without me, ok?

494
00:29:12,889 --> 00:29:14,924
I gotta go uh...

495
00:29:14,991 --> 00:29:18,417
take care of something I forgot
to take care of before. And...

496
00:29:18,537 --> 00:29:21,678
if I'm not back in time,
just start surgery without me, ok?

497
00:29:26,649 --> 00:29:28,402
No changes
without my ok?

498
00:29:28,522 --> 00:29:30,211
What kind of ego trip
is he on?

499
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:32,394
Well, it's always gotta be
the Christian Troy show,

500
00:29:32,514 --> 00:29:35,572
even my office.
You were very cool, my dear.

501
00:29:35,692 --> 00:29:38,896
Mmm, well, it's all
my years of acting.

502
00:29:40,312 --> 00:29:42,489
Ok, so, Sean, um,

503
00:29:42,557 --> 00:29:45,368
I'll get you some tear sheets
on the wood desks.

504
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:53,346
For this stuff,
you need to be YOB.

505
00:29:53,466 --> 00:29:55,106
I don't drink beer,
remember.

506
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:56,769
I mean bring
your own beano.

507
00:29:56,889 --> 00:30:00,023
Eating like a pig is one thing.
Smelling like them is another, ok?

508
00:30:00,143 --> 00:30:02,113
Stinky women are
a real turn off.

509
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:04,062
I'll keep that in mind.

510
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,013
All right.
We got everything.

511
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,516
When do you have
to be back at work?

512
00:30:13,817 --> 00:30:14,823
Whenever.

513
00:30:14,943 --> 00:30:17,652
It's not like my partner has
anywhere else to go.

514
00:30:17,772 --> 00:30:19,224
Then let's hit a matinee.

515
00:30:19,344 --> 00:30:21,584
We'll waste
the whole afternoon.

516
00:30:21,704 --> 00:30:25,507
You know, a movie theater is
the only place I can really relax.

517
00:30:25,627 --> 00:30:27,831
Because you sit in the dark
and nobody bothers you, or...

518
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:28,969
Maybe.

519
00:30:29,303 --> 00:30:31,605
Maybe I just like juju fruits.

520
00:30:43,459 --> 00:30:45,212
.. Alien nation!

521
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:56,973
That's right! Aye!

522
00:30:57,093 --> 00:30:59,532
Hey, have a little respect,
buddy boy.

523
00:31:07,248 --> 00:31:09,425
Go! Go!

524
00:31:17,523 --> 00:31:20,355
You know, uh,
you can slow down now.

525
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,225
We can't do anything
to change myself.

526
00:31:24,504 --> 00:31:26,972
I'm so sick of this face.

527
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:33,035
Jesus! What are you doing,
you crazy bitch?!

528
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,359
If you want to kill yourself, fine,
all right, but just let me out of the car!

529
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:38,827
Sorry, Christian.

530
00:31:38,947 --> 00:31:41,163
That's the only thing left
for me to do!

531
00:31:41,283 --> 00:31:43,098
Stop the car,
please stop the car!

532
00:31:43,218 --> 00:31:45,028
Jesus, Jesus!
Stop!

533
00:31:58,819 --> 00:32:01,569
Those guys at the E.R.
were awesome, by the way.

534
00:32:01,689 --> 00:32:03,425
She's lucky she's alive.

535
00:32:03,911 --> 00:32:05,747
What a crazy bitch.

536
00:32:07,532 --> 00:32:09,124
You're driving me
bat shit, Sean.

537
00:32:09,244 --> 00:32:10,110
Don't move.

538
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,887
Oh, Jesus.
Like waiting to get a shot,

539
00:32:12,007 --> 00:32:13,990
the anticipation is worse
than the actual needle.

540
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,440
Just go ahead and say it,
all right?

541
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,857
I think with my dick.
I am a dick. Ok, say it.

542
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:19,437
It's none of my business.

543
00:32:19,557 --> 00:32:22,380
Since when is me screwing up
none of your business, huh?

544
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,066
You thrive on it.

545
00:32:24,186 --> 00:32:26,272
That should heal
without a scar.

546
00:32:27,066 --> 00:32:30,208
I know you. You can
pretend you don't care.

547
00:32:31,325 --> 00:32:32,920
But I know you do.

548
00:32:34,856 --> 00:32:37,187
That may have been
true once.

549
00:32:39,128 --> 00:32:42,913
Come on, you can't tell me
you don't want to know what happened.

550
00:32:43,414 --> 00:32:45,764
I think I'll leave that
for Kimber to ask.

551
00:32:45,884 --> 00:32:46,983
She's your wife.

552
00:32:47,103 --> 00:32:48,635
She's the one who
might be curious.

553
00:32:48,755 --> 00:32:51,694
She's the one who pushed me
out of the goddamn door.

554
00:32:56,273 --> 00:32:57,608
So tell me...

555
00:32:58,907 --> 00:33:02,145
Is there anything about me
that you still like?

556
00:33:04,648 --> 00:33:06,183
I don't think so.

557
00:33:07,116 --> 00:33:10,137
You're a self-righteous
little prick, you know that?

558
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,855
Did it ever occur to you
that maybe it's you

559
00:33:13,975 --> 00:33:15,579
who needs me to
be angry at you?

560
00:33:15,699 --> 00:33:17,480
Quite frankly, it never
occurred to me.

561
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,849
Good, 'cause I'm done being
a substitute for your conscience.

562
00:33:20,969 --> 00:33:22,665
I know you can't change.

563
00:33:30,702 --> 00:33:32,354
So we met at the club.

564
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:35,049
It was love at first sight.

565
00:33:35,116 --> 00:33:37,212
But then when he told me
his story, oh, my God,

566
00:33:37,332 --> 00:33:40,476
imagine how much fun it will be
to teach him all about the last 20 years.

567
00:33:40,596 --> 00:33:42,049

Obama and Britney.

568
00:33:42,169 --> 00:33:43,596
All that stuff.

569
00:33:44,969 --> 00:33:46,986
Well, I don't understand,
Rupert.

570
00:33:47,106 --> 00:33:49,267
You don't need my consent
to have a girlfriend.

571
00:33:49,387 --> 00:33:51,080
Oh, fiancée.
We're engaged.

572
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,542
Well,
engaged to be engaged.

573
00:33:54,174 --> 00:33:56,444
I want to get McKenzie
breast implants.

574
00:33:56,831 --> 00:33:59,100
A diamond is
more traditional.

575
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,785
My right one's
a little smaller,

576
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:03,412
and it's sort of has that
pancake thing going on.

577
00:34:03,532 --> 00:34:05,388
It's been a struggle
her whole life.

578
00:34:05,508 --> 00:34:08,302
Rupert, can I speak to you
alone for a moment?

579
00:34:13,623 --> 00:34:15,015
She's awesome, isn't she?

580
00:34:15,083 --> 00:34:16,073
She's using you.

581
00:34:16,193 --> 00:34:17,256
Dude, you're wrong.

582
00:34:17,376 --> 00:34:19,690
We've been doing it nonstop
for like two days straight.

583
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:21,160
Sex is not love, ok?

584
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,430
It's usually not even
an expression of love.

585
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:26,945
Sometimes women and men use it
for less than innocent purposes.

586
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,439
You're just a kid. You've
been asleep for 20 years.

587
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:31,135
You don't understand
how women work.

588
00:34:31,255 --> 00:34:33,131
Oh, you do? I saw your moves
on the dance floor,

589
00:34:33,251 --> 00:34:34,427
it was pretty mediocre.

590
00:34:34,547 --> 00:34:36,714
- I was married for 20 years.
- How'd that turn out?

591
00:34:36,834 --> 00:34:38,125
Look, I've slept
with plenty of women.

592
00:34:38,245 --> 00:34:40,312
The good ones don't ask you
to buy them new breasts

593
00:34:40,432 --> 00:34:41,293
on the first date.

594
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:44,032
Well, look, thank you for caring,
but I'm going to do this.

595
00:34:44,152 --> 00:34:46,419
So do you want
my business or what?

596
00:34:47,435 --> 00:34:49,548
Ok. I'll just go get
a couple of samples.

597
00:34:49,668 --> 00:34:51,176
I assume she wants Ds?

598
00:34:51,244 --> 00:34:52,750
Yeah!
How'd you know that?

599
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:54,512
They always want Ds.

600
00:35:09,258 --> 00:35:11,985
Something's wrong with him!
I didn't touch him, I swear.

601
00:35:12,105 --> 00:35:14,577
I just wanted new tits,
I didn't touch him!

602
00:35:22,641 --> 00:35:24,427
He slipped back
into a coma.

603
00:35:24,928 --> 00:35:27,395
Well, when is he
going to wake up?

604
00:35:49,567 --> 00:35:53,110
Oh, my God! Baby,
what happened to you?

605
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:54,354
Your face!

606
00:35:54,474 --> 00:35:55,664
I'm fine.

607
00:35:55,731 --> 00:35:56,999
Your arm...

608
00:35:57,066 --> 00:35:58,767
I'm fine.
Seriously, I just...

609
00:35:58,835 --> 00:36:01,329
a few scrapes,
I was in an accident.

610
00:36:01,863 --> 00:36:05,062
I tried calling you.
You didn't pick up your phone.

611
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,474
I was...
I'm sorry...

612
00:36:06,541 --> 00:36:07,897
Why didn't you
pick up your phone?


613
00:36:08,017 --> 00:36:09,933
You always pick up
your phone when I call you.

614
00:36:10,053 --> 00:36:11,819
- I'm sorry, I don't...
- You ignoring me?

615
00:36:11,939 --> 00:36:13,588
- No.
- I get it.

616
00:36:14,638 --> 00:36:16,908
I've been such
an asshole lately.

617
00:36:18,961 --> 00:36:21,281
Especially with that
thing with Sean.

618
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,109
What thing with Sean?

619
00:36:27,714 --> 00:36:29,997
He's your first real client,
and I...

620
00:36:30,832 --> 00:36:31,950
I should...

621
00:36:32,834 --> 00:36:34,967
I should be supporting you,

622
00:36:35,087 --> 00:36:36,900
and I'm not, and I'm sorry.

623
00:36:39,371 --> 00:36:40,689
Oh, honey.

624
00:36:41,123 --> 00:36:42,972
You don't have to apologize.

625
00:36:43,092 --> 00:36:45,411
No, I do.
I'm sorry, ok?

626
00:36:48,881 --> 00:36:49,873
Well...

627
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:50,941
Please.

628
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:52,167
Um, ok.

629
00:36:52,943 --> 00:36:55,837
Where's your car?
Is it totaled?

630
00:36:56,904 --> 00:36:58,247
No, it wasn't my car.

631
00:36:58,315 --> 00:37:00,809
I was a passenger in
somebody else's car.

632
00:37:05,094 --> 00:37:07,565
Well, are they ok?
Who was it?

633
00:37:07,685 --> 00:37:09,861
They're fine. I mean,
I think, you know.

634
00:37:09,981 --> 00:37:13,074
It was a client,
Willow Banks.

635
00:37:14,561 --> 00:37:15,713
The model?

636
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:16,798
Yeah.

637
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:23,412
You were in a...

638
00:37:23,746 --> 00:37:26,266
car with Willow Banks
during the day,

639
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:29,080
and you were supposed
to be at work?

640
00:37:34,368 --> 00:37:37,500
Good news is that I didn't have
any lunch, so, ha.

641
00:37:38,285 --> 00:37:40,626
I think I lost about 5 pounds.

642
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,070
Maybe I should go
take a shower.

643
00:37:50,305 --> 00:37:52,975
Maybe you should
make it a cold one.

644
00:38:19,275 --> 00:38:21,366
I guess it worked
after all, huh?

645
00:38:21,912 --> 00:38:24,006
I wanted people
to stop looking.

646
00:38:24,126 --> 00:38:26,084
And now after they do,
they turn away.

647
00:38:26,204 --> 00:38:27,523
Just like you did.

648
00:38:27,643 --> 00:38:31,119
With their eyes full
of pity and disgust.

649
00:38:31,887 --> 00:38:33,673
They still don't see me.

650
00:38:35,018 --> 00:38:37,204
Well,
I guess going through

651
00:38:37,822 --> 00:38:41,455
a windshield at 110 miles an hour
was the answer all along, huh?

652
00:38:41,575 --> 00:38:42,923
Who knew?

653
00:38:43,043 --> 00:38:44,712
I need to talk to you.

654
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:46,832
Please.

655
00:38:48,303 --> 00:38:51,438
My parents sent me to this really
exclusive all-girls' prep school.

656
00:38:51,558 --> 00:38:54,112
The rich kids would always
dress like they were poor.

657
00:38:54,232 --> 00:38:55,318
 Slummin' it.

658
00:38:55,386 --> 00:38:57,443
It was fun for
them you know?

659
00:38:57,563 --> 00:39:00,970
Cool to reject the values
you'd grown up with.

660
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:03,005
Are you coming to
a point any time soon?

661
00:39:03,125 --> 00:39:04,635
When you have money,

662
00:39:05,053 --> 00:39:07,534
it's easy to romanticize
not having any.

663
00:39:08,313 --> 00:39:10,246
And when you're beautiful,

664
00:39:10,366 --> 00:39:13,194
well, it's easy wanting
to give that up, too.

665
00:39:13,675 --> 00:39:15,895
The romance of ugliness...

666
00:39:18,298 --> 00:39:20,114
All I wanted was to know that

667
00:39:20,234 --> 00:39:22,300
when someone looked at me,

668
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,278
they were actually seeing me.

669
00:39:26,225 --> 00:39:29,597
Not just some image they could
place on their mantelpiece or

670
00:39:29,717 --> 00:39:33,313
show off to their friends or
brag about having screwed.

671
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,719
You need to get help,
Willow.

672
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:41,058
Serious help.
I told you that,

673
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:43,242
I'm not the one
you should be coming to.

674
00:39:43,362 --> 00:39:45,036
But you understand me.

675
00:39:46,488 --> 00:39:48,654
- You're just like me!
- Bullshit!

676
00:39:48,774 --> 00:39:52,159
I'm not trying to carve up my face
or endanger other people.

677
00:39:52,279 --> 00:39:54,102
Then why were you
with me, huh?

678
00:39:54,222 --> 00:39:56,457
You wanted to destroy
yourself, too.

679
00:39:56,577 --> 00:39:59,110
In your own little passive
aggressive way.

680
00:39:59,178 --> 00:40:00,705
'Cause you're pissed.

681
00:40:01,387 --> 00:40:04,087
You know that all
the success you've ever had...

682
00:40:04,207 --> 00:40:07,461
wasn't because of what
you did or who you were.

683
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:11,470
It's always been
about the way you look.

684
00:40:13,032 --> 00:40:15,435
Just make me beautiful again.

685
00:40:16,682 --> 00:40:17,833
Fix me.

686
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:19,796
Give it back to me.

687
00:40:20,454 --> 00:40:22,720
I...
I can't live

688
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,400
looking like this.

689
00:40:24,468 --> 00:40:25,446
Willow.

690
00:40:25,566 --> 00:40:26,883
You need to listen to me.

691
00:40:27,003 --> 00:40:29,988
There's no doctor alive

692
00:40:31,273 --> 00:40:33,483
who can make you
beautiful again.

693
00:40:55,559 --> 00:40:57,309
Where's my treadmill?

694
00:40:57,429 --> 00:40:59,930
I had it moved to
the Malibu house.

695
00:41:00,214 --> 00:41:02,404
Your apartment's
too small for it.

696
00:41:03,606 --> 00:41:06,535
And I was hoping
Christian might take a hint.

697
00:41:14,109 --> 00:41:15,357
I gotta get going.

698
00:41:15,477 --> 00:41:17,445
No, no, no, hey,
just go back to sleep.

699
00:41:17,565 --> 00:41:18,467
Come on.

700
00:41:20,152 --> 00:41:22,087
Christian's going
to start to worry.

701
00:41:22,155 --> 00:41:23,637
No, he won't.

702
00:41:23,757 --> 00:41:25,373
Just a few more minutes.

703
00:41:26,642 --> 00:41:27,526
Ok.

704
00:41:28,461 --> 00:41:30,736
Will you wake me up
in 15 minutes?

705
00:41:32,522 --> 00:41:35,142
Promise me you're not
going to fall asleep.

706
00:41:35,262 --> 00:41:36,487
Don't worry,

707
00:41:36,607 --> 00:41:38,519
I'm wide awake.

708
00:42:04,526 --> 00:42:07,995
