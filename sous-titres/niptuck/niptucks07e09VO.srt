00:00:00,854 --> 00:00:02,221
Previously on "nip/tuck"...

2
00:00:02,341 --> 00:00:04,309
I'm getting married again.
He lives in England.

3
00:00:04,377 --> 00:00:06,792
- But what about our kids?
- I want them to come with me.

4
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:08,947
I'm pregnant.
It's Sean's sperm.

5
00:00:09,015 --> 00:00:10,515
You're gonna raise
another child?

6
00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:12,670
I have no legal rights,
and I am fine with that.

7
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,866
- Leishmaniasis.
- Why bring him to us?

8
00:00:14,986 --> 00:00:16,402
I want what's best
for my son.

9
00:00:16,522 --> 00:00:19,167
You've got a shot at the
real thing with Ramona.

10
00:00:19,287 --> 00:00:21,211
Ava's just gonna
toss you aside

11
00:00:21,331 --> 00:00:23,487
the second she's
done with you.

12
00:00:27,219 --> 00:00:28,221
He's late.

13
00:00:28,341 --> 00:00:29,613
What else is new?

14
00:00:30,081 --> 00:00:32,429
I swear, if he comes through
that door with that bitch,

15
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:34,900
I'm gonna throw them bot
off the balcony.

16
00:00:36,097 --> 00:00:38,870
Well, if it isn't our very
own Benjamin Braddock.

17
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:40,372
Do we really need
to start right in

18
00:00:40,492 --> 00:00:41,813
with all the jerk-off
comments, Christian?

19
00:00:41,933 --> 00:00:43,102
You bet your ass you do.

20
00:00:43,222 --> 00:00:45,318
We're the ones who had
to fight off Ramona's family

21
00:00:45,438 --> 00:00:48,138
to stop them hunting you down
and treating you like a pinata.

22
00:00:48,139 --> 00:00:49,559
It was like
the Alamo in there.

23
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:51,411
Yeah. They were
pretty pissed, huh?

24
00:00:51,531 --> 00:00:53,007
You left her at the altar.

25
00:00:53,127 --> 00:00:54,732
Humiliated her.
All of them.

26
00:00:54,852 --> 00:00:57,628
Yeah, I know, I know. And
I'm gonna clear that up

27
00:00:57,748 --> 00:01:00,913
as soon as things settle down
and we get back from Brazil.

28
00:01:01,033 --> 00:01:05,423
Well, Ava found a doctor in Rio
who's willing to do Rafael's surgery.

29
00:01:05,543 --> 00:01:06,698
And what about Jenna?

30
00:01:06,818 --> 00:01:08,736
You planning on taking
your daughter with you?

31
00:01:08,856 --> 00:01:11,273
No. And that's actually
why I came by.

32
00:01:11,393 --> 00:01:13,553
I wanted to ask you guys
if she could stay with you

33
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:14,679
for a couple of weeks.

34
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,281
I'm gonna be spending all my time
taking care of Rafael and Ava.

35
00:01:17,401 --> 00:01:19,699
Are you sure you didn't drop him
on his head when he was a baby?

36
00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:21,367
You're not thinking
clearly, Matt.

37
00:01:21,487 --> 00:01:24,032
I've never had less doubt
about anything in my life.

38
00:01:24,152 --> 00:01:26,332
I love her.
I've always loved her.

39
00:01:26,452 --> 00:01:28,057
She doesn't love you.

40
00:01:28,177 --> 00:01:30,095
Stop trying to twist everything

41
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,508
and diminish our feelings
for each other.

42
00:01:32,628 --> 00:01:34,196
You know,
I give up.

43
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:36,320
It's amazing how
you keep finding

44
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,999
new and creative ways
to screw up your life.

45
00:01:43,844 --> 00:01:44,884
All right,

46
00:01:45,697 --> 00:01:47,051
we'll take care
of Jenna,

47
00:01:47,171 --> 00:01:48,761
but get me the name
of this doctor in Brazil

48
00:01:48,881 --> 00:01:50,137
so I can check him out.

49
00:01:50,257 --> 00:01:51,492
Thanks.
I will.

50
00:01:51,834 --> 00:01:52,897
Why you doing this?

51
00:01:53,017 --> 00:01:55,041
I can't stop him anymore
than I can't stop you.

52
00:01:55,161 --> 00:01:57,329
All I can do is try to protect
my granddaughter.

53
00:01:57,449 --> 00:01:59,629
- Where is she?
- She's sleeping.

54
00:02:00,656 --> 00:02:03,386
Maybe when you get back
I'll let you see her.

55
00:02:03,506 --> 00:02:05,923
Well, you can't do this,
she's my daughter.

56
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:08,845
And you're abandoning her
to lie down with that she-devil.

57
00:02:08,965 --> 00:02:10,361
Now, get the hell
out of here,

58
00:02:10,481 --> 00:02:12,485
or I swear to God
you'll never see her again.

59
00:02:12,605 --> 00:02:13,269
Ok.

2, 3, 4, 5.

66
00:03:15,679 --> 00:03:16,546
9?

67
00:03:17,432 --> 00:03:19,553
Oh! Dammit, dammit.
Dammit.

68
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:26,234
You know, you guys are gonna
have to get an intern,

69
00:03:26,354 --> 00:03:28,600
because I can't be
doing this all day.

70
00:03:32,437 --> 00:03:34,298
Why you looking
at me like that?

71
00:03:34,418 --> 00:03:36,385
I think she's ready,
don't you?

72
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,024
Definitely.

73
00:03:38,793 --> 00:03:40,161
Put this on.

74
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,372
It's not my birthday,
so I'm just assuming

75
00:03:44,492 --> 00:03:47,014
you're taking me
in front of a firing squad.

76
00:03:50,488 --> 00:03:51,885
Surprise.

77
00:03:55,009 --> 00:03:56,129
Is this a joke?

78
00:03:56,249 --> 00:03:58,580
A joke would have been putting
your name first on the sign.

79
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,503
I thought it looked best
underneath ours,

80
00:04:00,623 --> 00:04:02,085
like you're supporting us,

81
00:04:02,205 --> 00:04:04,052
which is what
you've always done.

82
00:04:04,172 --> 00:04:06,011
Welcome to
the practice, partner.

83
00:04:06,424 --> 00:04:09,382
Lawyer should be getting you
the paperwork in the next few days.

84
00:04:09,502 --> 00:04:10,813
What about the baby?

85
00:04:10,933 --> 00:04:12,190
He doesn't have
to sign anything.

86
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,330
I mean, I can't ask for my first
official business as partner

87
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,211
to take maternity leave.

88
00:04:17,331 --> 00:04:19,745
You won't have to.
I'm having a nursery put in.

89
00:04:19,813 --> 00:04:21,602
You can keep the little guy
around all the time.

90
00:04:21,722 --> 00:04:23,363
- You never told me that.
- I know.

91
00:04:23,483 --> 00:04:25,436
I was thinking you two
are the closest thing

92
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:26,799
I have to family now.

93
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:29,008
I want to make sure
we all stick together.

94
00:04:29,128 --> 00:04:30,011
Sean,

95
00:04:30,809 --> 00:04:33,232
thank you,
I am so flattered.

96
00:04:33,352 --> 00:04:35,606
This has been
a dream for years.

97
00:04:35,726 --> 00:04:37,665
I don't even know
what to say.

98
00:04:38,662 --> 00:04:40,867
We're gonna help you
with that, too.

99
00:04:41,266 --> 00:04:44,145
Tell me what you don't like
about yourself, Mr...

100
00:04:44,658 --> 00:04:45,792
Yoshimura.

101
00:04:45,912 --> 00:04:48,585
What's not to like?
I'm an actor.

102
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,424
Over 100 films.

103
00:04:50,544 --> 00:04:53,303
I thought you looked familiar.
What would I have seen you in?

104
00:04:53,423 --> 00:04:55,312
That would be hard to say.

105
00:04:55,432 --> 00:04:57,952
I only really work in Japan.

106
00:04:58,194 --> 00:04:59,998
Could you give me
a couple of titles?

107
00:05:00,118 --> 00:05:01,726
They are what
you would call

108
00:05:01,846 --> 00:05:03,148
adult affair.

109
00:05:03,824 --> 00:05:05,998
- You mean...
- Yes.

110
00:05:06,118 --> 00:05:08,213
Gosh, you lucky bastard.

111
00:05:08,926 --> 00:05:10,687
So what brings you
to the States?

112
00:05:10,807 --> 00:05:12,807
I'm hoping to cross over.

113
00:05:12,927 --> 00:05:15,125
America has
the biggest market

114
00:05:15,245 --> 00:05:17,488
in adult movies
in the world.

115
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,791
Well, judging from
your excellent skin tone,

116
00:05:19,911 --> 00:05:22,022
I think a facelift,
perhaps an eyelift.

117
00:05:22,142 --> 00:05:24,801
We could shave 20 years
off your appearance.

118
00:05:24,921 --> 00:05:26,886
They want to make you
look younger?

119
00:05:27,006 --> 00:05:30,962
The market I'm in works
because of my age.

120
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,927
- How old are you?
- 73.

121
00:05:34,047 --> 00:05:36,338
For people
in my generation,

122
00:05:36,594 --> 00:05:38,241
the movies I make

123
00:05:38,361 --> 00:05:40,941
with the wrinkles
and exuberance say

124
00:05:41,511 --> 00:05:44,443
getting old is not
the end of life.

125
00:05:44,563 --> 00:05:46,566
You can still have fun.

126
00:05:46,686 --> 00:05:48,139
Wouldn't you say?

127
00:05:49,764 --> 00:05:51,289
How can we help?

128
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:55,000
I had a heart attack

129
00:05:55,844 --> 00:05:58,771
right after my wife
died 6 years ago.

130
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:00,216
I used to say

131
00:06:00,336 --> 00:06:02,710
I almost died
from a broken heart.

132
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:05,839
Truth was,
I was depressed.

133
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:07,978
- You were in mourning.
- No.

134
00:06:08,098 --> 00:06:10,816
I had nothing to do.
But now...

135
00:06:10,936 --> 00:06:12,882
I'm in a job
where I'm valued.

136
00:06:13,224 --> 00:06:14,950
Most people my age

137
00:06:15,306 --> 00:06:17,102
don't have that
anymore.

138
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,231
To stay busy,
to do what you love,

139
00:06:20,351 --> 00:06:23,657
it has given me
a second chance in life.

140
00:06:24,014 --> 00:06:26,886
Which is why I need
to get rid of the scar.

141
00:06:27,006 --> 00:06:29,114
You want your audience
to be reminded of life

142
00:06:29,234 --> 00:06:31,673
when they look at you
on the screen and not death.

143
00:06:31,793 --> 00:06:33,518
And this is America.

144
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:35,684
Old or young,

145
00:06:36,357 --> 00:06:39,005
appearances
still do matter.

146
00:06:48,511 --> 00:06:50,526
You know, I always see
these people

147
00:06:50,646 --> 00:06:52,633
we operate on
as just patients.

148
00:06:52,753 --> 00:06:55,489
You know, how much do you weigh,
do you have any allergies?

149
00:06:55,609 --> 00:06:57,763
I never get to hear
them tell their stories.

150
00:06:57,883 --> 00:06:58,639
And?

151
00:06:58,981 --> 00:07:01,370
And... it's harder
to judge them.

152
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,850
Are you trying to tell us
that you're wrong

153
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,768
for judging us
after all these years?

154
00:07:05,888 --> 00:07:08,832
I am saying that I have a new
appreciation for what you do,

155
00:07:08,952 --> 00:07:10,791
but it doesn't make
you any less dickheads.

156
00:07:10,911 --> 00:07:12,238
We all knew what
we were getting in to

157
00:07:12,358 --> 00:07:13,831
when we chose
this field of medicine.

158
00:07:13,951 --> 00:07:16,695
And we all knew that some of
the cases would be unsavory.

159
00:07:16,815 --> 00:07:19,096
But worrying about
why people come here

160
00:07:19,216 --> 00:07:22,303
gets in the way of what they're
coming here to have done.

161
00:07:22,745 --> 00:07:24,977
Are you stealing meds
from the store room?

162
00:07:25,097 --> 00:07:28,189
I, for one, am liking the new
Sean's attitude, by the way.

163
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:30,820
We've spent years changing
the way people look.

164
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:34,360
I am proof-positive that people
can change on the inside, too.

165
00:07:36,085 --> 00:07:37,524
Thank you, Linda.

166
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,799
Oh, my God.
We have to have this.

167
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,621
Yeah, it's pretty fantastic.

168
00:07:48,949 --> 00:07:52,206
Sean, what has happened
to our farewell lunch?

169
00:07:52,326 --> 00:07:53,623
Oh, just
a few more minutes.

170
00:07:53,743 --> 00:07:56,596
The restaurant's right across
the street. Excuse me, miss.

171
00:07:56,716 --> 00:07:58,278
Do you have one
in the back?

172
00:07:58,398 --> 00:07:59,925
- Yeah.
- Great.

173
00:08:02,434 --> 00:08:06,026
Sean, I was wondering,
how's Liz with all of this?

174
00:08:06,146 --> 00:08:07,608
Has she asked
for a lot of help?

175
00:08:07,728 --> 00:08:08,947
Why would you ask that?

176
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:10,751
What new mother
wouldn't want help?

177
00:08:10,871 --> 00:08:13,754
I just wondered if you
discussed, you know,

178
00:08:13,874 --> 00:08:16,100
how involved you'll be.

179
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,183
Well, we're not married,
we're not a couple,

180
00:08:18,303 --> 00:08:20,207
but I'm not
a sperm bank, either.

181
00:08:20,327 --> 00:08:21,404
Oh, look.

182
00:08:22,077 --> 00:08:24,483
Didn't we have
this exact one for Conor?

183
00:08:24,782 --> 00:08:28,011
Yeah, I think we did.
Sean, so wait a minute.

184
00:08:28,131 --> 00:08:30,558
You haven't formalized
any boundaries,

185
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:33,277
had any talks
about... anything?

186
00:08:33,397 --> 00:08:35,663
No. We will.
We will.

187
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,836
Sean,
can I just ask you,

188
00:08:40,956 --> 00:08:43,809
what happened to your plans
to work with Curtis?

189
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:45,796
Curt...
forget about Curtis.

190
00:08:49,337 --> 00:08:51,811
What is going on with you?

191
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,700
- Sean.
- Look at this.

192
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,072
No, it's not funny.
Listen to me.

193
00:08:56,192 --> 00:08:58,267
For the first time
in your life,

194
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,407
you can do
whatever you want.

195
00:09:00,527 --> 00:09:03,708
You're still relatively young,
you know. You're brilliant.

196
00:09:03,828 --> 00:09:06,579
You know what, I have finally
made some peace with my life,

197
00:09:06,699 --> 00:09:09,637
recommitted myself to the
practice, the partnership.

198
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,850
Liz is a bigger part
of the family than ever.

199
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,466
And there is
a baby on the way.

200
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:16,054
Why are you acting like
there's something wrong?

201
00:09:16,174 --> 00:09:17,015
Sean,

202
00:09:17,773 --> 00:09:20,479
I just want you
to have your best life.

203
00:09:23,328 --> 00:09:26,971
Ok, you know, maybe
I am just reading too much.

204
00:09:27,091 --> 00:09:28,246
You know what,

205
00:09:28,976 --> 00:09:30,184
I think you feel guilty

206
00:09:30,304 --> 00:09:32,547
because you're taking
my kids to London.

207
00:09:32,667 --> 00:09:36,240
You're reading all kinds
of things into everything.

208
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:37,708
I do.

209
00:09:38,435 --> 00:09:39,319
Julia,

210
00:09:40,103 --> 00:09:41,385
I'm fine with it.

211
00:09:42,169 --> 00:09:43,751
Let's go get some lunch.

212
00:09:44,421 --> 00:09:47,129
Oh, look at this.
Look at this rocking chair.

213
00:10:03,148 --> 00:10:04,709
Hudson,
get him out of here.

214
00:10:04,829 --> 00:10:07,206
Hudson and I have
a little understanding.

215
00:10:08,136 --> 00:10:09,644
Take it away, Hudson.

216
00:10:10,741 --> 00:10:13,577
You and I have no business
whatsoever to discuss.

217
00:10:14,902 --> 00:10:18,522
Ok. I guess I'll take Rafael's
surgery off the books, then.

218
00:10:23,281 --> 00:10:25,955
May I? It's really too good
a year to go to waste.

219
00:10:26,075 --> 00:10:27,323
What are your terms?

220
00:10:27,443 --> 00:10:28,933
Oh, come on,
sweetie pie.

221
00:10:29,053 --> 00:10:30,947
Just have a little
think about it.

222
00:10:31,067 --> 00:10:33,941
You'll operate on my son
if I leave yours.

223
00:10:34,061 --> 00:10:37,062
You really do have the heart
of a negotiator, don't you?

224
00:10:37,182 --> 00:10:39,319
I love Matt. I care about him
deeply. If you think...

225
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:42,377
I think that you would do anything
possible to get what you want.

226
00:10:42,497 --> 00:10:44,507
And what makes you think
Matt is not what I want?

227
00:10:44,627 --> 00:10:46,388
Because of the way
you look at him.

228
00:10:46,508 --> 00:10:48,333
You look at him
like you own him.

229
00:10:48,453 --> 00:10:49,890
That's not love.

230
00:10:50,246 --> 00:10:51,850
How the hell
would you know?

231
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:54,650
Because I've seen
the way you look at Rafael.

232
00:10:57,899 --> 00:10:59,546
Fine.
Fix my baby.

233
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,989
Make him the way
God intended him to be.

234
00:11:03,272 --> 00:11:05,125
And I'll tell Matt I'm not...

235
00:11:05,638 --> 00:11:06,792
available.

236
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:09,059
Do me a favor.

237
00:11:10,355 --> 00:11:12,322
Let him down easy,
would you?

238
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:15,458
Stupid shit actually thinks
you love him.

239
00:11:18,963 --> 00:11:20,559
Hudson, we're good.

240
00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:34,879
Do you think
this is gonna work?

241
00:11:34,999 --> 00:11:36,896
Ava just wants
her baby fixed. It's...

242
00:11:37,016 --> 00:11:38,755
what she wanted
all along.

243
00:11:39,054 --> 00:11:41,956
- Hey, not to interrupt, but...
- What are you doing here?

244
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,684
Well, I just wanted to thank you
for doing the surgery.

245
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:46,730
It means the world
to Ava and me.

246
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,091
Don't move.

247
00:11:49,321 --> 00:11:51,345
So tell me, why did Matt
just come in gushing

248
00:11:51,465 --> 00:11:54,281
about how happy he is
that we're doing the surgery.

249
00:11:54,523 --> 00:11:56,903
Well, it has to be this way,
don't you see?

250
00:11:57,023 --> 00:11:59,782
You have no real desire
to help me or my child.

251
00:12:00,038 --> 00:12:02,362
You're right about that.
I tell you one thing,

252
00:12:02,482 --> 00:12:04,394
ok, that kid is not
gonna see a scalpel

253
00:12:04,514 --> 00:12:06,318
until you come up
with your end of the deal.

254
00:12:06,438 --> 00:12:07,718
You don't trust me?

255
00:12:07,838 --> 00:12:09,343
And I don't trust you.

256
00:12:09,411 --> 00:12:11,084
So as soon as you
begin the operation,

257
00:12:11,204 --> 00:12:13,145
I'll tell Matt he's not
part of our future.

258
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:15,650
It'll happen
at the same time.

259
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:43,493
15 blade.

260
00:13:12,467 --> 00:13:14,163
This isn't happening, Matt.

261
00:13:14,847 --> 00:13:17,085
Don't worry,
he's gonna be fine.

262
00:13:17,783 --> 00:13:19,187
He's gonna be perfect.

263
00:13:19,307 --> 00:13:21,431
That's not what
I'm talking about.

264
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:25,949
You're not leaving
with Rafael and me.

265
00:13:27,801 --> 00:13:29,103
We don't need you.

266
00:13:30,315 --> 00:13:31,911
We don't want you.

267
00:13:35,758 --> 00:13:36,955
You came back.

268
00:13:38,355 --> 00:13:40,247
You came back
to me, remember?

269
00:13:40,367 --> 00:13:43,425
And I know you love me, Ava,
so why are you doing this?

270
00:13:44,309 --> 00:13:46,290
I don't love you, Matt.

271
00:13:47,217 --> 00:13:48,482
The truth is...

272
00:13:48,602 --> 00:13:50,423
I've never loved you.

273
00:14:14,281 --> 00:14:16,527
Conor's definitely
outgrown the sandals.

274
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:19,954
Annie's definitely outgrown
her Hello Kitty phase.

275
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:22,690
Oh, God,

276
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:25,740
it's just so hard to believe
that she's such a...

277
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,028
young lady now.

278
00:14:27,148 --> 00:14:28,363
I bet.

279
00:14:29,617 --> 00:14:31,585
What happened
to Sean?

280
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,537
That's what
I want to know.

281
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:36,742
You know, why did he change
his mind about Curtis?

282
00:14:36,862 --> 00:14:38,592
He came to his senses
is what happened.

283
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,251
Yeah, well, that's
what he says,

284
00:14:40,371 --> 00:14:43,375
but he keeps saying
these weird things like,

285
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:46,133
you know,
"I've accepted my life.

286
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,968
I'm embracing
who I am,"

287
00:14:48,036 --> 00:14:51,207
like some sort of
robotic affirmation tape.

288
00:14:51,327 --> 00:14:52,197
Meaning?

289
00:14:52,454 --> 00:14:53,380
Meaning

290
00:14:54,064 --> 00:14:57,912
he wanted something else,
and you know that.

291
00:14:58,326 --> 00:15:00,947
I mean, with the kids and I
going to London,

292
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,840
I mean, he has
less reason than ever

293
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,584
to stay in a job
he doesn't love.

294
00:15:04,652 --> 00:15:07,654
And yet for some reason, he's
more entrenched than ever.

295
00:15:07,722 --> 00:15:08,522
Entrenched.

296
00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:11,290
Well, you love it.
But he doesn't love it anymore.

297
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,402
And he's afraid
to make the leap

298
00:15:13,522 --> 00:15:15,862
because he's afraid
to leave you.

299
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:18,700
If he wanted to save
the world, he'd be doing it.

300
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,365
Ok? I think he's better off
than he ever has been.

301
00:15:21,485 --> 00:15:22,622
He's happy,

302
00:15:22,742 --> 00:15:24,036
he's upbeat.

303
00:15:24,278 --> 00:15:25,789
I mean, we're
having fun again.

304
00:15:25,909 --> 00:15:26,907
He's in denial.

305
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:28,890
He's staving off his feelings,
you know, like

306
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,763
he's shoring up
the levee.

307
00:15:31,482 --> 00:15:32,637
You're wrong.

308
00:15:34,347 --> 00:15:36,578
Sean doesn't leave me
because I'm different

309
00:15:36,698 --> 00:15:38,893
than everybody else
in his life.

310
00:15:40,261 --> 00:15:41,458
I love him.

311
00:15:45,106 --> 00:15:46,218
I need him.

312
00:15:48,313 --> 00:15:50,664
You know what you do,
Christian.

313
00:15:50,907 --> 00:15:52,261
You steal

314
00:15:52,531 --> 00:15:54,014
people's souls.

315
00:15:54,983 --> 00:15:57,531
Now, you tried it
with me and I got lucky,

316
00:15:57,651 --> 00:15:58,817
I escaped.

317
00:16:00,755 --> 00:16:02,564
So I'm gonna pray
for Sean.

318
00:16:03,476 --> 00:16:06,840
I'm gonna pray
that his luck changes.

319
00:16:23,271 --> 00:16:24,995
Is mine mei or kei?

320
00:16:26,535 --> 00:16:28,530
If mine's mei or... Oh.

321
00:16:29,237 --> 00:16:30,670
This is fantastic.

322
00:16:30,738 --> 00:16:32,999
- It was your idea.
- I know it was.

323
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:35,901
A man needs
an anchor in his life.

324
00:16:36,713 --> 00:16:38,907
I used to think
mine was Julia,

325
00:16:39,437 --> 00:16:41,173
Julia and the kids.

326
00:16:41,572 --> 00:16:42,792
That's bullshit.

327
00:16:42,912 --> 00:16:44,522
So what's your anchor?

328
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,558
You.

329
00:16:48,214 --> 00:16:50,052
You and the business.

330
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:52,103
And I want to do like

331
00:16:52,683 --> 00:16:55,711
10 tit jobs a day,
and then I just want

332
00:16:56,352 --> 00:16:58,076
to spend the money.

333
00:17:01,483 --> 00:17:03,572
What about all that
pro Bono shit?

334
00:17:03,692 --> 00:17:05,809
Maybe you're just
too scared to do that stuff.

335
00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:07,112
I'm not scared.

336
00:17:07,675 --> 00:17:10,085
I just know I want
to be here with you.

337
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:14,177
Hey, do you think we can talk
them into getting implants?

338
00:17:18,553 --> 00:17:20,377
Let's dance a little bit.

339
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:22,456
Let's dance.

340
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:27,981
Have you ever
considered

341
00:17:28,426 --> 00:17:30,034
going up to a "D"?

342
00:17:30,981 --> 00:17:33,005
No, really.
You'd be amazed. 

343
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:35,570
Just that little bit
of difference can...

344
00:17:38,311 --> 00:17:41,133
Little bit more and
you're fantastic.

345
00:17:47,976 --> 00:17:49,458
Have fun, pal.

346
00:17:53,897 --> 00:17:55,821
Does anyone
want a drink?

347
00:17:56,524 --> 00:17:57,702
Just a little.

348
00:18:00,858 --> 00:18:03,181
Why don't you guys
just go get a cab?

349
00:18:04,848 --> 00:18:06,302
Thanks, sweetie.

350
00:18:07,115 --> 00:18:08,084
Bye.

351
00:18:09,461 --> 00:18:11,457
- Sorry.
- That's ok.

352
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:18,583
All right.

353
00:18:19,267 --> 00:18:20,193
Seany.

354
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:23,243
Come on, buddy.
Come on. Come on, get up.

355
00:18:23,614 --> 00:18:24,540
Get up.

356
00:19:11,812 --> 00:19:14,520
I thought I told you
to take a cab.

357
00:19:14,947 --> 00:19:16,386
Hey, sailor.

358
00:19:20,484 --> 00:19:21,396
Kimber?

359
00:19:25,528 --> 00:19:27,261
I missed you so much.

360
00:19:27,381 --> 00:19:28,230
Really?

361
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,120
Yeah.

362
00:19:30,945 --> 00:19:32,968
'Cause I didn't miss you.

363
00:19:33,812 --> 00:19:36,475
I know I said to you
that I did,

364
00:19:37,145 --> 00:19:38,698
but not so much.

365
00:19:38,818 --> 00:19:41,876
I think I'm finally
free of you now.

366
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,940
Don't say that.

367
00:19:46,181 --> 00:19:48,832
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

368
00:19:49,844 --> 00:19:52,766
And yet you stole my soul.

369
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:57,184
I had to kill myself
to get away from you.

370
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,803
That was
the only way out.

371
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:06,845
And now Sean's killing
himself, too, Christian.

372
00:20:07,572 --> 00:20:11,292
If he stays with you,
he's a dead man.

373
00:21:21,199 --> 00:21:23,721
I didn't expect there
to be so much...

374
00:21:25,332 --> 00:21:27,042
so many scars.

375
00:21:27,484 --> 00:21:29,815
He'll require
a few more procedures.

376
00:21:29,935 --> 00:21:30,844
Will the...

377
00:21:30,964 --> 00:21:33,007
the markings
go away eventually?

378
00:21:33,127 --> 00:21:35,719
It'll take
a series of operations.

379
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:37,740
One a year
for the next 5 years.

380
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,293
5 years?

381
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:43,383
But then after that,
he'll be fine?

382
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:46,205
Evidence of the scarification
won't be visible?

383
00:21:46,325 --> 00:21:47,060
No.

384
00:21:47,402 --> 00:21:48,779
He'll look better,

385
00:21:48,899 --> 00:21:51,008
that much I can
promise you, but...

386
00:21:51,364 --> 00:21:53,787
some of the scarring
will be permanent.

387
00:21:57,692 --> 00:21:59,182
He'll never be perfect.

388
00:21:59,302 --> 00:22:01,455
Nothing that breathes
is perfect.

389
00:22:05,147 --> 00:22:07,043
When I was young,
my, uh,

390
00:22:07,983 --> 00:22:10,827
my father told me
the story of a bird handler.

391
00:22:10,947 --> 00:22:14,823
He decided to paint the strongest
of his birds a different color.

392
00:22:16,391 --> 00:22:19,113
As it flew
toward its flock,

393
00:22:20,396 --> 00:22:22,120
they instantly attacked it,

394
00:22:22,704 --> 00:22:25,583
violently pecking
the intruder to death.

395
00:22:30,344 --> 00:22:32,310
My father was trying
to warn me

396
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:37,455
to be different is to lead
a life of pain and persecution.

397
00:22:41,232 --> 00:22:42,372
He was right.

398
00:22:46,619 --> 00:22:48,287
I survived it once.

399
00:22:49,526 --> 00:22:51,293
I can't survive it again.

400
00:22:56,794 --> 00:23:00,898
The estate will provide for him.
He'll be well taken care of.

401
00:23:01,796 --> 00:23:03,279
What about love?

402
00:23:03,399 --> 00:23:05,288
Will the estate
provide that?

403
00:23:06,642 --> 00:23:07,996
Will life?

404
00:23:09,876 --> 00:23:11,652
I will never understand you.

405
00:23:11,772 --> 00:23:14,708
Sure you do, Sean.
Look at this place.

406
00:23:14,828 --> 00:23:17,052
You're the high priest
of conformity.

407
00:23:17,172 --> 00:23:19,203
You dance around
the golden calf shouting,

408
00:23:19,323 --> 00:23:20,893
"how you look is
who you are."

409
00:23:21,013 --> 00:23:23,521
Different is just
another word for ugly.

410
00:23:26,453 --> 00:23:28,635
I'm not the monster, Sean.

411
00:23:28,755 --> 00:23:30,733
I'm just one of its victims.

412
00:23:37,388 --> 00:23:39,398
Be strong, my love.

413
00:23:40,524 --> 00:23:41,650
Survive.

414
00:24:04,751 --> 00:24:07,459
Ok.
You ready?

415
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:09,306
Oh, Sean,
I'm scared.

416
00:24:09,426 --> 00:24:12,042
The sign in the lobby
almost gave me an aneurysm.

417
00:24:12,162 --> 00:24:13,288
Ta-da.

418
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:15,511
What do you think?

419
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,264
Isn't it great?

420
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,238
You know, we can even
hire some help if we want to.

421
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:22,667
Someone to watch over
him or her when...

422
00:24:22,787 --> 00:24:24,570
we're in surgery,
but at least...

423
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,067
he'll be with us.

424
00:24:26,187 --> 00:24:26,942
Us?

425
00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:29,451
This isn't your baby, Sean.

426
00:24:30,006 --> 00:24:32,372
I came to you because
I thought you were respected

427
00:24:32,492 --> 00:24:35,693
the fact that I wanted
to do this on my own.

428
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:39,497
I'm sorry, Liz, but I thought
I could just be there

429
00:24:39,768 --> 00:24:41,733
when you needed me,
when the baby needed me.

430
00:24:41,853 --> 00:24:43,415
The baby isn't
gonna need you.

431
00:24:43,535 --> 00:24:44,968
The baby has me.

432
00:24:46,221 --> 00:24:46,991
Fine.

433
00:24:47,322 --> 00:24:50,143
Sooner or later, he's gonna
want to know who his dad is.

434
00:24:50,263 --> 00:24:52,039
And I'm gonna tell
him or her,

435
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,003
and if they want to look,
I'm not gonna stop them.

436
00:24:58,552 --> 00:24:59,394
Well.

437
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:07,303
At least he won't have
to go far to find me.

438
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:11,380
I can't stay here, Sean.

439
00:25:11,993 --> 00:25:15,768
I should have known this was
a really stupid, stupid idea.

440
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,065
I mean,

441
00:25:17,493 --> 00:25:19,773
how could I expect
you to just...

442
00:25:20,343 --> 00:25:22,052
give me
your sperm and...

443
00:25:22,383 --> 00:25:23,988
then want nothing?

444
00:25:24,108 --> 00:25:26,136
But I don't, Liz.
I don't want anything.

445
00:25:26,256 --> 00:25:27,408
Oh, Sean.

446
00:25:27,528 --> 00:25:30,319
You can lie
to yourself if you want,

447
00:25:30,732 --> 00:25:33,812
but I see it. I mean,
I should have seen it before.

448
00:25:40,653 --> 00:25:43,147
This is my chance
to be a parent.

449
00:25:43,849 --> 00:25:45,997
You've already had yours.

450
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,161
Where are you gonna go?

451
00:25:49,603 --> 00:25:50,800
I don't know.

452
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:54,051
But don't want you
to come and find us.

453
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:54,791
Ok.

454
00:25:55,104 --> 00:25:56,088
Promise.

455
00:25:56,804 --> 00:25:57,813
Jesus.

456
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:01,675
Can you at least let me
know where you are?

457
00:26:02,745 --> 00:26:04,597
I care about you, Liz.

458
00:26:05,467 --> 00:26:07,220
And I care about you.

459
00:26:30,762 --> 00:26:31,755
Grandpa!

460
00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:33,535
What are you doing home?

461
00:26:33,655 --> 00:26:35,066
The question is,

462
00:26:35,548 --> 00:26:38,227
why are you not
in school, toji?

463
00:26:38,469 --> 00:26:40,465
Get back to UCLA.

464
00:26:40,585 --> 00:26:43,567
You have thermodynamics
in half an hour.

465
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:45,211
Yes, sir, grandfather.

466
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:50,742
Now,

467
00:26:51,044 --> 00:26:54,119
what do we have here,
little lady?

468
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:59,005
I've heard about you,
grandpa.

469
00:26:59,125 --> 00:27:01,858
Your size is legendary.

470
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:06,589
I don't know if I could
handle you all by myself.

471
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:11,121
Don't worry,
you don't have to.

472
00:27:11,936 --> 00:27:14,570
I've asked over
some friends.

473
00:27:14,929 --> 00:27:15,696
Oy!

474
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:22,740
Oh, grandfather.

475
00:27:58,082 --> 00:27:59,393
He's dead?

476
00:28:00,989 --> 00:28:04,908
Massive heart attack
right after monster orgasm.

477
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,111
I'm so sorry.

478
00:28:07,231 --> 00:28:08,272
Poor guy.

479
00:28:08,706 --> 00:28:10,943
I guess the strain
was just too much.

480
00:28:11,841 --> 00:28:13,850
No, not poor guy.

481
00:28:20,952 --> 00:28:23,674
Hiro died
a very happy man.

482
00:28:25,612 --> 00:28:28,348
He lived and died
the way he wanted to.

483
00:28:31,484 --> 00:28:33,736
We should all be so lucky.

484
00:28:46,719 --> 00:28:48,629
You got one of those for me?

485
00:28:51,335 --> 00:28:53,923
You know, I was afraid you
wouldn't answer the door

486
00:28:54,043 --> 00:28:56,822
if you saw it was me,
so I came up from the beach.

487
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:58,550
Can I come in?

488
00:28:59,034 --> 00:29:01,223
Only if you're here because
you brought me a new...

489
00:29:01,343 --> 00:29:03,210
30 year old
bottle of scotch.

490
00:29:06,744 --> 00:29:07,827
I, uh,

491
00:29:10,224 --> 00:29:11,405
came here

492
00:29:12,776 --> 00:29:14,651
to get
my daughter back.

493
00:29:16,754 --> 00:29:19,542
Ava's gone,
Christian.

494
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:23,234
Now I need
to get on with my life.

495
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,196
You know what it is
to be a father, Matt?

496
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,247
It's about sacrifice.

497
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:34,552
Sacrificing
everything you have

498
00:29:34,922 --> 00:29:36,333
for your kids.

499
00:29:40,809 --> 00:29:42,947
I haven't seen
any part of...

500
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,537
you that makes me think
that you're capable of that.

501
00:29:50,086 --> 00:29:51,183
Yes, I am.

502
00:29:52,073 --> 00:29:54,123
When was the last time
you did anything...

503
00:29:54,243 --> 00:29:56,905
that wasn't about
putting your needs first?

504
00:29:58,842 --> 00:29:59,755
Today

505
00:30:01,482 --> 00:30:04,234
when I begged Ramona
to get back together with me.

506
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,324
And she actually
took you back?

507
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:10,774
Wait a minute.
Wait!

508
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:11,683
Get away from...

509
00:30:11,803 --> 00:30:13,510
You embarrassed me in
front of my entire family.

510
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:15,097
She still wants
to get married?

511
00:30:15,217 --> 00:30:16,315
Yeah.
She...

512
00:30:16,583 --> 00:30:19,163
was an angel
about the whole thing.

513
00:30:22,383 --> 00:30:24,372
I told her I was gonna
get Jenna so that

514
00:30:24,492 --> 00:30:27,383
we could begin
the healing process.

515
00:30:32,527 --> 00:30:34,431
I'm a good father,
Christian.

516
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:35,306
Or...

517
00:30:37,501 --> 00:30:38,741
or I can be.

518
00:30:54,004 --> 00:30:55,828
You ready to go home,
sweetheart?

519
00:30:56,327 --> 00:30:57,111
Yeah?

520
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,932
Come over here.
Give me a hug.

521
00:31:04,653 --> 00:31:06,890
Your daddy's come
to take you home.

522
00:31:07,275 --> 00:31:09,498
Kiss.
Give me a kiss?

523
00:31:14,571 --> 00:31:16,410
Hi, baby.

524
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:25,075
I'm gonna make you proud.

525
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:37,769
Ok, here you go.

526
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:43,390
You're gonna be just fine.

527
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,614
You're strong.

528
00:31:49,318 --> 00:31:53,317
Sean, I just got off
the phone with the place...

529
00:31:53,437 --> 00:31:55,284
Ava took the baby from.

530
00:31:55,404 --> 00:31:56,345
And?

531
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:59,974
And they have
an affiliate in Phoenix,

532
00:32:00,094 --> 00:32:02,485
and they want to come
pick him up tomorrow.

533
00:32:02,841 --> 00:32:03,672
No.

534
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,902
They're gonna
come get him, Sean.

535
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,697
He's not yours.

536
00:32:11,595 --> 00:32:13,348
You can't just keep him
here indefinitely.

537
00:32:13,468 --> 00:32:15,799
I'm not letting him
on a plane for 14 hours

538
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:18,231
after what he's just
been through. Period.

539
00:32:18,351 --> 00:32:21,287
Tell them I will call them
when I think he's ready.

540
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:28,612
It's ok.
Come on.

541
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,864
Oh, come here.

542
00:32:32,304 --> 00:32:34,755
 I know. I know.

543
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:42,394
It's ok.
Yeah.

544
00:33:01,862 --> 00:33:03,174
It's ok.

545
00:33:04,556 --> 00:33:05,639
It's ok.

546
00:33:22,321 --> 00:33:23,869
You sure about this, Sean?

547
00:33:23,989 --> 00:33:25,379
Of course I am.

548
00:33:25,499 --> 00:33:26,847
This might be
the last time

549
00:33:26,967 --> 00:33:28,637
we break bread
together as a family.

550
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:30,562
Next time you'll be
a married woman again.

551
00:33:30,629 --> 00:33:32,818
Might be the last time you
get a decent meal in a while,

552
00:33:32,938 --> 00:33:34,879
London isn't exactly
known for its cuisine.

553
00:33:34,999 --> 00:33:36,666
I'll get the spoons, dad.

554
00:33:37,236 --> 00:33:40,314
And you, Liz,
you'll be a mother soon.

555
00:33:41,412 --> 00:33:44,106
You guys excited
about going to London?

556
00:33:45,217 --> 00:33:46,893
You should see
Edmund's house.

557
00:33:47,013 --> 00:33:48,247
It's like a castle.

558
00:33:48,367 --> 00:33:50,698
Where's Matt? He and Ramona
should be here by now.

559
00:33:50,818 --> 00:33:53,017
Oh, he called to say that
they couldn't make it.

560
00:33:53,085 --> 00:33:56,989
Something about a sale
on at rug world or whatever.

561
00:33:57,288 --> 00:33:59,254
So we said our goodbyes.

562
00:33:59,374 --> 00:34:02,293
Now, Sean, is there anything
that I can do to help?

563
00:34:02,361 --> 00:34:04,613
Nope.
It's all taken care of.

564
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,406
All right.

565
00:34:07,833 --> 00:34:10,310
I would like to thank
each of you

566
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:12,023
for being part
of my family.

567
00:34:12,721 --> 00:34:15,323
I love you all.
To cherished memories...

568
00:34:15,443 --> 00:34:16,648
and bright futures.

569
00:34:16,768 --> 00:34:17,923
Bright futures.

570
00:34:18,043 --> 00:34:19,034
Cheers.

571
00:34:21,215 --> 00:34:22,369
All right.

572
00:35:34,285 --> 00:35:35,311
Bye, dad.

573
00:35:48,309 --> 00:35:52,271
I know that the next time
we see each other,

574
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:56,717
it will be as if
not a day has gone by.

575
00:35:57,074 --> 00:35:58,399
I'll still be sucking

576
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:00,808
the champagne
and caviar out of life.

577
00:36:02,832 --> 00:36:04,048
I love you.

578
00:36:04,571 --> 00:36:06,252
Look after him for me.

579
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,102
I will.

580
00:36:15,844 --> 00:36:17,497
Call me when you land.

581
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,017
Promise.

582
00:36:27,773 --> 00:36:29,154
Goodbye, Julia.

583
00:36:30,778 --> 00:36:31,619
Bye.

584
00:36:39,971 --> 00:36:41,610
I'll start cleaning.

585
00:36:51,316 --> 00:36:52,695
Where's our 10:00?

586
00:36:52,815 --> 00:36:55,278
And why are there workers
messing with our new sign?

587
00:36:55,398 --> 00:36:57,031
I cancelled the consult.

588
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:58,627
Sit down.

589
00:37:15,103 --> 00:37:17,536
Tell me what you don't
like about yourself.

590
00:37:18,025 --> 00:37:19,422
Yeah, um,

591
00:37:20,252 --> 00:37:21,770
we're in surgery all day,

592
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:24,082
so when are you
planning on rescheduling

593
00:37:24,202 --> 00:37:25,664
Mrs. Howe's consult?

594
00:37:30,553 --> 00:37:32,320
Just answer the question.

595
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:33,483
Why?

596
00:37:33,603 --> 00:37:35,584
Because we've always
used it to manipulate people

597
00:37:35,704 --> 00:37:38,420
 into thinking that
they can change, but they...

598
00:37:38,691 --> 00:37:39,512
can't.

599
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:42,739
You want to have an intellectual
conversation about this? Fine.

600
00:37:42,859 --> 00:37:45,053
I do think
people can change.

601
00:37:45,837 --> 00:37:46,920
Look at me.

602
00:37:47,404 --> 00:37:48,217
I mean,

603
00:37:48,463 --> 00:37:50,540
I was very
unhappy for...

604
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:51,993
a long time.

605
00:37:52,635 --> 00:37:55,343
But now I'm settled,
I'm content.

606
00:37:57,296 --> 00:38:00,514
Pretending you're not miserable
isn't changing, it's...

607
00:38:00,634 --> 00:38:01,656
denial.

608
00:38:02,597 --> 00:38:04,005
Did you cancel
Mrs. Howe...

609
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:05,861
just so you could
give me a hard time?

610
00:38:05,981 --> 00:38:08,597
Sean, I'm trying to
help you here, buddy boy.

611
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:13,009
You know, I've had thousands of
people sit across this desk from me,

612
00:38:13,129 --> 00:38:15,713
begging me to turn them from
a caterpillar into a butterfly.

613
00:38:15,833 --> 00:38:17,281
The only one
I've ever met

614
00:38:17,349 --> 00:38:19,353
who actually has a real
chance at doing that...

615
00:38:19,473 --> 00:38:20,351
is you.

616
00:38:21,135 --> 00:38:21,819
Me?

617
00:38:22,218 --> 00:38:23,486
Mm-hmm.
You.

618
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,420
I know I can't.

619
00:38:28,675 --> 00:38:29,887
Don't want to.

620
00:38:33,777 --> 00:38:35,944
Why would I want
to change my life?

621
00:38:36,887 --> 00:38:38,551
I have a great partner.

622
00:38:39,193 --> 00:38:42,143
And aside from this
ridiculous conversation,

623
00:38:42,263 --> 00:38:44,423
a thriving practice.
And...

624
00:38:45,235 --> 00:38:48,193
now that Julia and
the kids are really gone,

625
00:38:48,313 --> 00:38:49,325
I'm free.

626
00:38:49,445 --> 00:38:50,807
I am free...

627
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,130
to see whoever I want.

628
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:53,928
So.

629
00:38:54,214 --> 00:38:56,288
Why are you
making this so hard?

630
00:38:56,408 --> 00:38:58,190
Making what so hard?

631
00:38:58,917 --> 00:39:00,883
You're all over the place.

632
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:06,427
I wanted this to last
forever, you know that.

633
00:39:15,349 --> 00:39:17,082
I'm dissolving
our partnership.

634
00:39:17,202 --> 00:39:18,128
What?

635
00:39:22,689 --> 00:39:24,926
I won't to work
with you anymore.

636
00:39:27,334 --> 00:39:30,079
You can't make a
unilateral decision like that.

637
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:31,681
Legally speaking,

638
00:39:32,468 --> 00:39:33,805
yes, I can.

639
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:37,084
It's gonna
cost me some, but...

640
00:39:37,204 --> 00:39:39,397
I already have my attorneys
drawing up the papers.

641
00:39:39,464 --> 00:39:41,444
Oh, bullshit.
I'm here on my terms,

642
00:39:41,564 --> 00:39:43,382
and if and when
I choose to leave,

643
00:39:43,502 --> 00:39:45,164
it will be on my terms.

644
00:40:12,582 --> 00:40:13,530
Bucharest?

645
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:15,560
I want you take Rafael back.

646
00:40:19,295 --> 00:40:21,703
I see how you
look at him, Sean.

647
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:25,220
Take him back.

648
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,677
See what happens.

649
00:40:29,313 --> 00:40:31,066
These are one-way tickets.

650
00:40:32,648 --> 00:40:34,541
I'm sure they could
use you there.

651
00:40:34,661 --> 00:40:36,198
All those sick kids.

652
00:40:37,052 --> 00:40:40,344
They could use a good surgeon,
somebody who wants to spend...

653
00:40:41,854 --> 00:40:43,650
their life healing people.

654
00:40:48,054 --> 00:40:51,869
And in 6 months when I'm pining
for the glamour of Hollywood?

655
00:40:52,824 --> 00:40:55,047
We both know
that's not gonna happen.

656
00:40:56,219 --> 00:40:59,010
Besides, you'd have
nothing to come back to.

657
00:41:08,102 --> 00:41:10,211
Someday you'll
thank me for this.

658
00:42:08,674 --> 00:42:10,684
<i>May I have
your attention, please.</i>

659
00:42:10,804 --> 00:42:12,736
<i>TSA paging
Mary Ellen Bovar.</i>

660
00:42:13,235 --> 00:42:15,546
<i>Mary Ellen Bovar,
please...</i>

661
00:42:15,988 --> 00:42:17,598
Walk you to security?

662
00:42:20,419 --> 00:42:23,782
I couldn't afford
first class, but...

663
00:42:24,794 --> 00:42:26,697
I can't let you do this.

664
00:42:27,246 --> 00:42:28,756
I didn't ask
your permission.

665
00:42:28,876 --> 00:42:30,737
Slow down.
We need to talk.

666
00:42:31,336 --> 00:42:32,732
About Rafael.

667
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,420
What about him?

668
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:37,629
Well, I know you changed
your mind about adopting him.

669
00:42:37,749 --> 00:42:38,661
Wrong.

670
00:42:38,781 --> 00:42:41,697
I abandoned him like
a stray dog with mange.

671
00:42:42,766 --> 00:42:43,849
Look at me, Matt.

672
00:42:43,969 --> 00:42:46,095
Get the smoke out of your eyes
and see me for who I am.

673
00:42:46,215 --> 00:42:47,497
I do see you, Ava.

674
00:42:47,617 --> 00:42:49,991
Every inch of you
chiseled to perfection.

675
00:42:50,305 --> 00:42:52,935
But being perfect hasn't
made you complete, has it?

676
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:55,863
And you think you're
the one who can complete me?

677
00:42:56,291 --> 00:42:57,902
I don't love you, Matt.

678
00:42:58,757 --> 00:42:59,939
I don't care.

679
00:43:00,581 --> 00:43:01,917
Well, you should.

680
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:03,274
You're young,

681
00:43:03,394 --> 00:43:06,031
and some day you'll find
someone who loves you back.

682
00:43:06,151 --> 00:43:07,020
Right.

683
00:43:07,348 --> 00:43:09,743
Now who's got
the smoke in their eyes?

684
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:13,748
Hey.

685
00:43:14,598 --> 00:43:16,288
Let me tell you something.

686
00:43:16,408 --> 00:43:19,166
I'm never gonna love anyone
as much as I love you.

687
00:43:19,286 --> 00:43:20,928
And I've pretty
much accepted the fact

688
00:43:21,048 --> 00:43:22,895
that you're as good
as it's gonna get for me.

689
00:43:23,015 --> 00:43:24,127
What about me?

690
00:43:24,247 --> 00:43:26,492
Have you thought about why
I'd want to spend my life...

691
00:43:26,612 --> 00:43:28,359
with someone
I didn't love?

692
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:32,165
Because Jenna is as good
as it's gonna get for you.

693
00:43:33,588 --> 00:43:35,839
I may be a total screw-up,
but somehow...

694
00:43:35,959 --> 00:43:37,430
I've produced a daughter

695
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:39,844
who is as perfect
as a child can be.

696
00:43:42,367 --> 00:43:43,907
Go on, take her.

697
00:43:54,767 --> 00:43:56,791
A little girl of your own

698
00:43:56,911 --> 00:43:58,073
to love

699
00:43:58,957 --> 00:44:01,508
and a man who
completely adores you.

700
00:44:02,492 --> 00:44:05,085
That's not such
a bad deal, is it?

701
00:44:05,545 --> 00:44:08,239
Now tell me we're not
the perfect family.

702
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:20,036
Here we go.

703
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:21,861
Good job.

704
00:44:25,417 --> 00:44:26,800
Passports?

705
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:30,876

708
00:44:37,375 --> 00:44:39,827
Have you started interviewing
potential partners yet?

709
00:44:39,947 --> 00:44:41,748
No, I think
we'll just keep...

710
00:44:41,868 --> 00:44:44,929
holding down the fort on
our own for a bit, you know.

711
00:44:47,652 --> 00:44:49,447
Can't replace you,
anyway.

712
00:44:59,837 --> 00:45:00,963
Well,

713
00:45:01,451 --> 00:45:02,916

00:45:05,695 --> 00:45:06,821
You excited?

715
00:45:07,106 --> 00:45:08,090
Excited,

716
00:45:08,606 --> 00:45:09,729
terrified,

717
00:45:11,114 --> 00:45:12,423
and grateful.

718
00:45:18,509 --> 00:45:19,549
Thank you.

719
00:45:21,773 --> 00:45:22,756

This your son?

721
00:45:50,561 --> 00:45:51,360
Yes.

722
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:41,682
Can I buy you a drink?

723
00:46:41,953 --> 00:46:43,187
I don't drink.

724
00:46:43,663 --> 00:46:44,854
One for the road?

725
00:46:44,974 --> 00:46:46,399
No, thanks.
I have to...

726
00:46:46,519 --> 00:46:47,938

00:46:49,249 --> 00:46:50,703

Plastic surgeon.
