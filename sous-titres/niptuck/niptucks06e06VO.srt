<i>Previously, on nip/Tuck...</i>

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,521
You're one of the most respected
psychologists in the country.

3
00:00:04,641 --> 00:00:07,173
It's just a good thing
I didn't sacrifice my career

4
00:00:07,293 --> 00:00:08,990
so my daughter
could have one.

5
00:00:09,058 --> 00:00:11,160
It's Kimber.
I'm in love with her.

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,983
What?
You seen Kimber?

7
00:00:13,103 --> 00:00:14,276
It's cute, huh?

8
00:00:14,396 --> 00:00:15,329
I got shot.

9
00:00:15,397 --> 00:00:16,831
You got shot?
How?

10
00:00:16,898 --> 00:00:20,081
I was desperate. I started robbing
convenience stores.

11
00:00:20,201 --> 00:00:22,184
I'm taking the kids
to a hotel.

12
00:00:22,304 --> 00:00:24,505
You can't just take them
away from me.

13
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:27,372
One day, you'll see
that this is for the best.

14
00:00:31,447 --> 00:00:33,862
Tell me what you don't like
about yourself.

15
00:00:34,372 --> 00:00:35,367
Erica,

16
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,844
Don't psychoanalyze me.
Just get me out of here.

17
00:00:38,964 --> 00:00:41,682
I'm required to submit
an evaluation.

18
00:00:41,802 --> 00:00:44,237
There must be an awful
lot you don't like

19
00:00:44,357 --> 00:00:46,922
about yourself for you
to attempt suicide.

20
00:00:47,042 --> 00:00:48,996
I wasn't attempting suicide.

21
00:00:50,313 --> 00:00:51,357
I just--

22
00:00:51,786 --> 00:00:53,682
I swam out too far.

23
00:00:53,802 --> 00:00:54,909
Naked.

24
00:00:55,621 --> 00:00:58,982
In the middle of the night,
1 1/2 miles from the shore,

25
00:00:59,546 --> 00:01:03,959
clinging to a buoy.
That's a hell of a miscalculation.

26
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:05,869
I went for a night swim.

27
00:01:05,989 --> 00:01:07,399
It was cold,

28
00:01:08,087 --> 00:01:09,231
beautiful.

29
00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:12,430
Just me and the water.

30
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:16,360
Felt like I was one
with the ocean, like...

31
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,029
I was inside it and...

32
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:22,561
it was inside me.

33
00:01:22,681 --> 00:01:24,428
If my son were in jail

34
00:01:24,548 --> 00:01:26,322
and my ex-wife
were a lesbian,

35
00:01:26,442 --> 00:01:28,194
my daughter dined on hair

36
00:01:28,314 --> 00:01:31,476
and my newly married,
just murdered wife

37
00:01:32,194 --> 00:01:34,398
turned out to be
Lucretia Borgia,

38
00:01:35,911 --> 00:01:38,795
I'd take the plunge myself.
I'd be crazy not to.

39
00:01:40,615 --> 00:01:43,065
Sean, don't bullshit
a bullshitter.

40
00:01:44,925 --> 00:01:48,372
I can't get you out of the psych ward
if you don't level with me.

41
00:01:56,134 --> 00:01:59,837
The idea
that someone like Teddy

42
00:01:59,957 --> 00:02:03,189
could be in love with me
was so overwhelming,

43
00:02:05,051 --> 00:02:07,239
I was blind to who she really was,

44
00:02:09,782 --> 00:02:13,253
And I, uh, I wound up

45
00:02:13,966 --> 00:02:16,223
putting my kids at risk.

46
00:02:18,422 --> 00:02:21,536
It's hard to forgive yourself
for something like that.

47
00:02:22,929 --> 00:02:23,940
Go on.

48
00:02:25,692 --> 00:02:28,907
I was gonna swim
until my arms fell off.

49
00:02:33,644 --> 00:02:35,848
And then, about a mile out,

50
00:02:38,635 --> 00:02:40,414
I, uh, had a...

51
00:02:42,337 --> 00:02:43,828
change of heart.

52
00:02:44,177 --> 00:02:46,970
Something inside of me
opened up and I...

53
00:02:48,887 --> 00:02:51,587
I thought about how much
I love my family.

54
00:02:52,928 --> 00:02:54,353
So, I fought.

55
00:02:55,557 --> 00:02:57,719
I fought to stay alive.

56
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:07,664
Thank you, Sean.

57
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,573
So, did you drive?

58
00:03:11,693 --> 00:03:13,822
- Yes.
- Oh, good.

59
00:03:14,774 --> 00:03:17,124
So, you can give me
a ride back to malibu.

60
00:03:17,244 --> 00:03:18,946
Oh, no, Sean, I can't.

61
00:03:19,388 --> 00:03:21,290
The policy is very clear.

62
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,611
You attempted to commit suicide

63
00:03:23,731 --> 00:03:25,653
within the last 48 hours.

64
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,360
I can't authorize your release.

65
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,913
It would be
professionally irresponsible.

66
00:03:36,398 --> 00:03:37,482
Take care.

71
00:04:30,962 --> 00:04:32,018
Hey, Bud.

72
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:33,349
You got a sec?

73
00:04:33,469 --> 00:04:35,845
I wanna get your opinion
on something.

74
00:04:36,878 --> 00:04:39,432
Hey, uh, I'm really sorry
to hear about Sean.

75
00:04:39,552 --> 00:04:41,914
God, you think you know
someone, and then...

76
00:04:42,034 --> 00:04:43,658
What do you want, Mike?

77
00:04:47,227 --> 00:04:48,748
What do you think, huh?

78
00:04:48,868 --> 00:04:50,323
Is it big enough?

79
00:04:50,443 --> 00:04:51,583
5 carats.

80
00:04:52,031 --> 00:04:53,792
Cost a quarter of a mill.

81
00:04:54,633 --> 00:04:56,670
Yeah, she's gonna
go crazy for it.

82
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:00,179
Don't you think it's a little soon to be
asking Kimber to marry you? Hmm?

83
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:02,420
You've been dating for what?
3 months?

84
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,576
Well, when you know,
you know.

85
00:05:04,696 --> 00:05:06,751
Kimber and I are soul mates.

86
00:05:08,413 --> 00:05:10,896
You think this is
some kind of competition.

87
00:05:11,016 --> 00:05:12,298
Not really.

88
00:05:12,418 --> 00:05:13,639
She's mine.

89
00:05:14,735 --> 00:05:16,969
Why don't you get
the hell out of here,

90
00:05:17,089 --> 00:05:18,790
Drop your key off
at reception.

91
00:05:18,857 --> 00:05:21,192
I'm popping your surgery pod
like a whitehead.

92
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,160
No problem.

93
00:05:23,027 --> 00:05:24,780
You know what, christian?

94
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,304
You're an asshole.

95
00:05:26,424 --> 00:05:28,899
But I really do hope
Sean gets better soon.

96
00:05:40,929 --> 00:05:42,616
I'll tell you what's crazy.

97
00:05:42,736 --> 00:05:44,812
Julia calling her mother and
thinking that bitch...

98
00:05:44,932 --> 00:05:46,556
would ever lift a finger
to help me.

99
00:05:46,676 --> 00:05:49,524
Now, just relax, all right?
It's over. You're out.

100
00:05:49,644 --> 00:05:51,236
What'd you tell them, anyway?

101
00:05:51,356 --> 00:05:53,464
That I tried to discourage you
from training at night

102
00:05:53,584 --> 00:05:55,121
without a certified escort boat,

103
00:05:55,241 --> 00:05:57,468
but nothing could stop you from
pursuing your...

104
00:05:57,588 --> 00:06:00,286
dream of, one day,
swimming the English channel.

105
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:02,816
They believed I was
a competitive swimmer?

106
00:06:02,936 --> 00:06:05,080
And they thought
you were delusional,

107
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,914
but they can't keep you
for longer than 24 hours.

108
00:06:12,013 --> 00:06:13,778
Why are we stopping here?

109
00:06:13,846 --> 00:06:16,449
While you were in the can
with all the other nut cases,

110
00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:18,513
Mike proposed to Kimber.

111
00:06:18,633 --> 00:06:21,653
So, I have a hankering
for a cold scotch

112
00:06:21,773 --> 00:06:23,261
and a hot sandwich.

113
00:06:23,381 --> 00:06:26,805
- She say "yes?"
- Who gives a shit? Just have a drink with me.

114
00:06:26,925 --> 00:06:30,888
You just got out of the snake pit yourself.
Don't tell me you don't need one.

115
00:06:31,008 --> 00:06:32,513
You know what?
Some other time.

116
00:06:32,633 --> 00:06:35,480
I have a few things I need
to talk over with Julia.

117
00:06:36,913 --> 00:06:39,445
Just how far were you
planning on swimming?

118
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:40,672
Changed my mind.

119
00:06:40,739 --> 00:06:42,507
That's all that matters now.

120
00:06:42,574 --> 00:06:44,342
I suddenly thought,

121
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:46,825
What if there are
other possibilities?

122
00:06:47,545 --> 00:06:50,029
We consult each other
on everything.

123
00:06:50,425 --> 00:06:51,403
Right?

124
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:54,684
What you did was
stupid and selfish.

125
00:06:54,804 --> 00:06:57,069
If you ever do it again,
I'll kill you.

126
00:06:58,105 --> 00:07:00,457
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right.

127
00:07:23,628 --> 00:07:26,028
- Can I get another drink, please?
- Sure.

128
00:07:26,148 --> 00:07:28,701
I just need your cell phone
and car keys.

129
00:07:28,821 --> 00:07:30,644
I'm an expert at reading people,

130
00:07:30,764 --> 00:07:34,321
And you're about 5 minutes
from calling her or just driving over,

131
00:07:34,441 --> 00:07:35,625
and either way,

132
00:07:35,745 --> 00:07:37,342
someone's gonna get hurt.

133
00:07:37,462 --> 00:07:40,246
You know, if you're trying
to make me feel better, it's not working.

134
00:07:40,366 --> 00:07:43,113
I thought that was
the vodka's job, not mine.

135
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,521
So, you're a real bitch, huh?

136
00:07:45,641 --> 00:07:46,405
Yep.

137
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,779
And you strike me as
the kind of guy

138
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:51,818
who attracts that sort of thing.

139
00:07:52,216 --> 00:07:53,969
What's your name, handsome?

140
00:07:54,089 --> 00:07:55,480
My name is christian.

141
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,681
Christian.

142
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,271
I'm Alexis.

143
00:08:00,161 --> 00:08:02,945
I tell you what.
This one's on the house if...

144
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,205
you promise not to do
anything stupid,

145
00:08:06,325 --> 00:08:09,542
and in return, you have to give me
all the gritty details.

146
00:08:10,977 --> 00:08:13,393
Or if you'd rather
wallow in self-pity,

147
00:08:13,513 --> 00:08:15,635
I'll put that on your tab.

148
00:08:18,086 --> 00:08:19,804
Her name is Kimber.

149
00:08:20,685 --> 00:08:23,273
We've known each other
for a very long time,

150
00:08:23,393 --> 00:08:25,129
what seems like a lifetime.

151
00:08:25,249 --> 00:08:27,791
Started off as a one night stand
and just...

152
00:08:28,181 --> 00:08:29,358
never stopped.

153
00:08:29,478 --> 00:08:31,169
The sex was that good, huh?

154
00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:32,814
It was unbelievable.

155
00:08:33,487 --> 00:08:35,280
And I don't even like her.

156
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,334
But you love her
and that's what's killing you.

157
00:08:41,044 --> 00:08:42,055
I'm sorry.

158
00:08:42,983 --> 00:08:45,029
I know what that's like.

159
00:08:46,378 --> 00:08:47,943
But as I always say,

160
00:08:48,063 --> 00:08:50,745
the best way of getting
over someone...

161
00:08:50,865 --> 00:08:53,391
is to get on top
of someone else.

162
00:08:58,912 --> 00:09:01,742
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- What'd I do?

163
00:09:01,862 --> 00:09:04,585
Oh, nothing.
You taste like honey.

164
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,869
And your body's like...

165
00:09:08,989 --> 00:09:10,262
David

166
00:09:11,979 --> 00:09:14,234
How could anyone let you go?

167
00:09:15,493 --> 00:09:16,984
I'm a plastic surgeon.

168
00:09:17,104 --> 00:09:18,196
Oh, my god.

169
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:21,183
Now you're really
blowing my mind.

170
00:09:24,888 --> 00:09:25,800
Well...

171
00:09:26,813 --> 00:09:29,121
It's time to return the favor.

172
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,975
I've got a better idea.

173
00:10:09,396 --> 00:10:12,562
I've never had someone ask
for that on a first date before.

174
00:10:18,662 --> 00:10:20,120
You have to go.

175
00:10:22,979 --> 00:10:23,858
Why?

176
00:10:25,098 --> 00:10:26,822
Do I have to spell it out?

177
00:10:26,942 --> 00:10:28,430
I want you to leave.

178
00:10:28,927 --> 00:10:30,437
You had your fun.

179
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,120
I don't wanna spoon.

180
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:35,570
Good-bye.

181
00:10:40,162 --> 00:10:43,211
This beats the hell outta
the meatloaf I had last night.

182
00:10:43,331 --> 00:10:45,325
I still don't know
what they put in it.

183
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:46,781
Thank you, Sean.

184
00:10:46,901 --> 00:10:49,299
It's good to know that
my cooking's better than

185
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:51,355
the mental institution's.

186
00:10:53,524 --> 00:10:56,275
- I was just trying to break the ice.
- Don't.

187
00:10:56,395 --> 00:10:57,562
I like the ice.

188
00:10:57,629 --> 00:11:00,197
I want to keep the frozen
right where it is.

189
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,239
Hey, beautiful.

190
00:11:11,076 --> 00:11:12,343
Hey, sweetie, um,...

191
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:15,418
Daddy and I have some things
we want to discuss with grandma.

192
00:11:15,538 --> 00:11:17,233
Can you give us some privacy?

193
00:11:17,353 --> 00:11:18,764
Thanks. Mwah.

194
00:11:19,909 --> 00:11:21,896
See you...

195
00:11:23,805 --> 00:11:25,591
So, Sean,
how are you feeling?

196
00:11:25,711 --> 00:11:27,819
Just how long would you have
kept me in that place?

197
00:11:27,939 --> 00:11:29,432
Well, let's not go there.

198
00:11:29,552 --> 00:11:31,885
Oh, no.
I want to answer his question.

199
00:11:32,005 --> 00:11:35,559
I think you should still be
under psychiatric supervision.

200
00:11:37,548 --> 00:11:39,551
Make you feel powerful, Erica?

201
00:11:39,874 --> 00:11:41,332
Have control over me?

202
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,305
God knows, you manipulated
your daughter her whole life.

203
00:11:45,657 --> 00:11:46,799
Julia,

204
00:11:47,152 --> 00:11:50,728
your decision to placate
this unstable man and...

205
00:11:50,848 --> 00:11:52,984
endanger the children,

206
00:11:53,051 --> 00:11:54,829
is quite frankly, baffling.

207
00:11:55,412 --> 00:11:58,543
Well, this unstable man
happens to be their father.

208
00:11:58,991 --> 00:12:01,991
Father who's willing to leave
his children fatherless.

209
00:12:02,111 --> 00:12:04,984
He's a father only
in the biological sense.

210
00:12:05,943 --> 00:12:08,640
I'm petitioning for custody
of the children.

211
00:12:10,702 --> 00:12:12,597
You'd really do that?

212
00:12:13,153 --> 00:12:15,954
You'd take... my children from me?

213
00:12:16,074 --> 00:12:17,980
You vengeful bitch.

214
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,960
I'd like to see you try.
Now, don't pay attention to her.

215
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,164
She's just doing what
she enjoys most...

216
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,424
causing you pain.

217
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:26,168
Um, you know what?
I'll...

218
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:29,524
take the kids back to New York
if Sean can have supervised visits.

219
00:12:29,644 --> 00:12:31,788
Why are you letting her
intimidate you like this?

220
00:12:31,908 --> 00:12:34,127
Because she's one of
the best child advocates

221
00:12:34,247 --> 00:12:35,685
in the country, Sean.

222
00:12:36,037 --> 00:12:38,689
If Erica Noughton says
a home is unsuitable...

223
00:12:39,076 --> 00:12:42,065
Oh, my god, how could
you have been so stupid?

224
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:44,927
Well, in all fairness, Julia,

225
00:12:45,047 --> 00:12:47,562
you haven't exactly
been June Cleaver.

226
00:12:47,682 --> 00:12:49,034
Come on, Julia.

227
00:12:49,154 --> 00:12:52,121
She's never gonna get the kids.
I mean, look at her.

228
00:12:52,431 --> 00:12:55,125
Don't let appearance
deceive you.

229
00:12:55,814 --> 00:12:58,341
Like they say,
you're as young as you feel.

230
00:13:03,388 --> 00:13:07,541
And I have been feeling
remarkably youthful these days.

231
00:13:32,453 --> 00:13:34,707
Whatever happens
to you in this place,

232
00:13:34,827 --> 00:13:36,470
you mustn't be ashamed.

233
00:13:36,809 --> 00:13:38,472
It's just the way things are.

234
00:13:38,592 --> 00:13:40,989
Really? So, you know
the way things are in here?

235
00:13:41,109 --> 00:13:42,791
I know that you have neither

236
00:13:42,911 --> 00:13:45,514
the muscle mass
nor the gang affiliations

237
00:13:45,634 --> 00:13:46,947
to be a predator,

238
00:13:47,015 --> 00:13:49,886
and it's not your nature to be
a nilly queen, so,

239
00:13:50,442 --> 00:13:53,429
If you don't want to be passed
around like a box of chocolates,

240
00:13:53,549 --> 00:13:55,518
you had better find a protector.

241
00:13:56,087 --> 00:13:58,411
You want me to become
somebody's bitch?

242
00:13:58,531 --> 00:14:00,122
Cleaning a man's cell?

243
00:14:00,242 --> 00:14:01,759
Doing his laundry?

244
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:03,908
Small price to pay
for your life.

245
00:14:04,028 --> 00:14:05,166
You're wrong.

246
00:14:05,234 --> 00:14:06,501
One is all it takes.

247
00:14:06,569 --> 00:14:08,693
After you get turned out,
you lose your status as a man

248
00:14:08,813 --> 00:14:10,287
and you can never
get that back.

249
00:14:10,407 --> 00:14:12,348
Status?
Among savages?

250
00:14:12,842 --> 00:14:14,740
It's survival of the fittest.

251
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,064
If you don't adapt,
you won't make it.

252
00:14:19,932 --> 00:14:21,616
How's mom and dad?

253
00:14:22,449 --> 00:14:24,268
They haven't come here
to see you?

254
00:14:24,388 --> 00:14:25,727
No, dad came once.

255
00:14:25,847 --> 00:14:27,836
He was having
a really hard time.

256
00:14:27,956 --> 00:14:29,023
Then mom...

257
00:14:30,776 --> 00:14:32,890
I don't want her
to see me this way.

258
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:35,108
She tried to come,
but I wouldn't see her.

259
00:14:35,228 --> 00:14:37,716
So, once again,
it's about their feelings?

260
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,120
Matt, your parents are
totally self-absorbed.

261
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,076
They should be here
supporting you.

262
00:14:43,196 --> 00:14:44,920
You are the one in hell.

263
00:14:45,924 --> 00:14:47,627
You're not the one
that let them down.

264
00:14:47,747 --> 00:14:49,018
It's the other way around.

265
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,586
Don't you see that?

266
00:14:51,912 --> 00:14:54,964
Well, yeah, I suppose they could
have been there more. Sure.

267
00:14:55,084 --> 00:14:57,535
They were too busy
acting out on each other

268
00:14:57,655 --> 00:14:59,835
to instill a sense
of self in you.

269
00:14:59,955 --> 00:15:02,772
And they're doing the same thing
to Connor and Annie.

270
00:15:02,892 --> 00:15:04,768
If you want to be a real man,

271
00:15:04,888 --> 00:15:07,659
stand up for your brother
and sister. Protect them.

272
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,666
How am I supposed to do that?

273
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:12,792
You can help me get custody.

274
00:15:13,605 --> 00:15:16,225
You would know better than
anyone what it will cost them

275
00:15:16,345 --> 00:15:18,554
if they stay with
their mother and Sean.

276
00:15:18,674 --> 00:15:20,067
No offense, but...

277
00:15:20,381 --> 00:15:22,685
Aren't you a little old
to be a mom?

278
00:15:23,192 --> 00:15:24,170
Well...

279
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,114
It wasn't part
of my retirement plan.

280
00:15:31,312 --> 00:15:33,745
But I can't sit out and
watch them sink

281
00:15:33,865 --> 00:15:35,854
deeper into dysfunction.

282
00:15:39,186 --> 00:15:41,580
Will you be my witness, Matt?

283
00:15:51,491 --> 00:15:52,170
Hey.

284
00:15:52,714 --> 00:15:54,689
What do you think about these?

285
00:15:55,893 --> 00:15:58,390
Why not have fresh flowers
delivered, huh?

286
00:15:58,903 --> 00:16:01,314
They brighten everything up,
don't they?

287
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:02,380
Oh.

288
00:16:04,406 --> 00:16:05,766
What the hell?

289
00:16:10,347 --> 00:16:11,988
It's expired. What?

290
00:16:13,553 --> 00:16:14,431
Right.

291
00:16:15,282 --> 00:16:16,697
That's all it is.

292
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:18,529
Sour yogurt.

293
00:16:19,934 --> 00:16:21,662
You want to talk about it?

294
00:16:22,792 --> 00:16:25,228
I mean, look.
If we're gonna work together,

295
00:16:25,348 --> 00:16:29,574
then I think that we should be able
to talk to each other like we used to.

296
00:16:31,698 --> 00:16:32,842
Talk to me.

297
00:16:33,215 --> 00:16:36,598
I'm afraid I might hurt your feelings
and I don't want to do that anymore.

298
00:16:36,718 --> 00:16:39,019
You're not going to hurt
my feelings.

299
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:42,431
As a matter of fact,
I think it might make us feel,

300
00:16:43,078 --> 00:16:44,697
You know, like...

301
00:16:45,327 --> 00:16:47,556
like we're getting
back to normal.

302
00:16:53,768 --> 00:16:55,620
I met this woman yesterday.

303
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,737
Gorgeous.

304
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:59,330
I mean, hot body, hot ass.

305
00:17:00,026 --> 00:17:02,636
Went back to her place
and nailed her like a...

306
00:17:02,756 --> 00:17:04,626
I mean, incredible sex.

307
00:17:04,746 --> 00:17:06,472
I mean raw, nasty, mean...

308
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:08,589
but in a good way... sex.
You know?

309
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:10,444
Then she asked me to...

310
00:17:10,564 --> 00:17:13,462
take her in the back door,
which was great.

311
00:17:14,627 --> 00:17:16,964
Anyway, we finished and, uh,

312
00:17:17,727 --> 00:17:19,386
She kicked me out.

313
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:21,838
So, what's that about?

314
00:17:23,648 --> 00:17:24,941
You know what?

315
00:17:25,239 --> 00:17:27,621
You should have trusted
your first instinct.

316
00:17:27,741 --> 00:17:29,852
Next time, don't tell me.

317
00:17:33,842 --> 00:17:35,843
Hey, how's everything
going with Erica?

318
00:17:35,963 --> 00:17:38,346
Well, I just got a letter
from her lawyer.

319
00:17:38,466 --> 00:17:40,360
She's started
custody proceedings.

320
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,645
Sean, the whole thing
is ridiculous.

321
00:17:41,765 --> 00:17:44,050
There's no way she's gonna get
custody of those kids, all right?

322
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,075
Julia's gonna stay out here
so we can fight this together.

323
00:17:46,195 --> 00:17:47,356
We got an attorney, but

324
00:17:47,476 --> 00:17:49,706
I'm gonna have to spend
as much time with my kids as I can

325
00:17:49,826 --> 00:17:51,081
until this gets resolved.

326
00:17:51,201 --> 00:17:53,518
Can you get Mike
to cover for me?

327
00:17:53,638 --> 00:17:56,105
That's gonna be a problem,
because I just fired him.

328
00:17:56,225 --> 00:17:57,846
I just saw him
in the exam room.

329
00:17:57,966 --> 00:17:59,555
Yeah, he's cleaning
his stuff out.

330
00:17:59,675 --> 00:18:01,450
We're just getting back
on our feet here.

331
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:03,048
Without his help,
we're screwed.

332
00:18:03,168 --> 00:18:04,886
You need to get him
to stay, christian.

333
00:18:05,006 --> 00:18:06,977
We need as much support
as we can get

334
00:18:07,097 --> 00:18:09,297
if I'm gonna be able
to keep my kids.

335
00:18:23,863 --> 00:18:25,616
Just leave everything
where it is.

336
00:18:25,736 --> 00:18:28,152
It's my stuff. I told you
I was taking out what I brought in.

337
00:18:28,272 --> 00:18:30,513
You don't have to.
Leave, that is.

338
00:18:30,633 --> 00:18:33,190
I went through the contract we signed
when you first came on board,

339
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,216
and since there's some surgeries
on the books,

340
00:18:35,336 --> 00:18:37,185
I'm holding you accountable.

341
00:18:37,911 --> 00:18:39,845
So, you're trying
to get me to stay now?

342
00:18:39,965 --> 00:18:43,098
No, I'd rather you go, but,
you know, it's a legal issue.

343
00:18:43,218 --> 00:18:44,459
So, sue me.

344
00:18:44,579 --> 00:18:46,528
- Look, I'm sorry.
- No, you look.

345
00:18:46,648 --> 00:18:47,790
I'm happy to go.

346
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,017
And now that I've built up
my client list,

347
00:18:50,137 --> 00:18:51,738
my fiancee and I
are looking forward

348
00:18:51,858 --> 00:18:53,756
to starting my new practice
in Beverly hills.

349
00:18:53,876 --> 00:18:55,719
- Your fiancee?
- Yeah, that's right.

350
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:57,140
Kimber accepted.

351
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,870
Wept tears of joy.

352
00:18:59,268 --> 00:19:01,041
Happiest day of her life.

353
00:19:01,455 --> 00:19:04,789
Now that it's official,
we're only gonna get better.

354
00:19:14,032 --> 00:19:15,142
Alexis.

355
00:19:17,584 --> 00:19:19,142
What a surprise.

356
00:19:21,465 --> 00:19:23,454
What do you think
she's afraid of?

357
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:28,745
Hmm. Well, I think
we're all afraid of something.

358
00:19:29,096 --> 00:19:30,825
That's what I like about it.

359
00:19:31,529 --> 00:19:34,625
And if you stick around for an hour,
we can go out for a drink.

360
00:19:34,745 --> 00:19:36,826
I have to be at work
in an hour.

361
00:19:36,946 --> 00:19:38,132
Oh.

362
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,583
And, truthfully,

363
00:19:40,461 --> 00:19:43,146
I'm here
for professional reasons.

364
00:19:44,025 --> 00:19:45,368
Not personal.

365
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:49,520
This about your breasts?

366
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,750
'cause I...

367
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:53,562
I didn't want to say anything,
but you could definitely go...

368
00:19:53,682 --> 00:19:55,038
a cup bigger.

369
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:58,728
I want you to give me
a sex change operation.

370
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,253
I want to be a man.

371
00:20:05,312 --> 00:20:06,870
I was that bad, huh?

372
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:09,761
I'm a little, uh, confused. Um,

373
00:20:09,881 --> 00:20:11,982
I... I thought we had a good time.

374
00:20:12,102 --> 00:20:13,059
We did.

375
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:15,430
There's no reason
why we can't again.

376
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,287
I'll still have the same lips,

377
00:20:17,407 --> 00:20:18,772
The same hot ass.

378
00:20:19,807 --> 00:20:22,694
Let's get this clear.
I'm not into men.

379
00:20:24,101 --> 00:20:27,130
I'm into women.
Beautiful women, like you.

380
00:20:27,415 --> 00:20:29,850
Actually, I was born a man.

381
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:34,192
I had sexual reassignment
surgery when I was 23.

382
00:20:39,681 --> 00:20:42,748
As a boy,
I was always so pretty.

383
00:20:43,883 --> 00:20:46,227
My hand gestures were
feminine and...

384
00:20:46,347 --> 00:20:48,750
it always seemed like
I was so much...

385
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:50,950
more of a girl
than a guy.

386
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:54,507
In high school,
I wasn't attracted to girls. I just...

387
00:20:54,627 --> 00:20:56,658
wanted to hang out
with them.

388
00:20:56,778 --> 00:21:00,095
I had crushes on all
the same guys they did.

389
00:21:00,734 --> 00:21:04,601
And, finally, it was clear.
I was a girl living...

390
00:21:05,446 --> 00:21:07,004
in a male body.

391
00:21:07,593 --> 00:21:09,549
So, why the change of heart?

392
00:21:09,814 --> 00:21:11,717
Forget to take your hormones?

393
00:21:11,993 --> 00:21:13,557
I still love men.

394
00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:16,130
I still love glamour,

395
00:21:16,852 --> 00:21:19,333
And I'd rather hang out
with women, but...

396
00:21:19,453 --> 00:21:21,943
I've come to
the understanding that...

397
00:21:22,063 --> 00:21:23,479
I'm not a woman.

398
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:26,094
I--I'm a gay man.

399
00:21:26,214 --> 00:21:27,866
So you, uh, you tricked me.

400
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:30,500
You've lied to me and pretended
that you're a woman.

401
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,912
I am a woman.

402
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,929
I prefer to be a man.

403
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:38,669
Haven't you ever had
a change of heart?

404
00:21:40,124 --> 00:21:42,738
It's not the same as changing
one's mind.

405
00:21:42,858 --> 00:21:46,148
Sometimes, we don't have
the choice about what we feel.

406
00:21:46,268 --> 00:21:48,902
Oh, come on. That's the biggest line
of tranny bullshit I've ever heard.

407
00:21:49,022 --> 00:21:50,709
I mean, think about
what you're saying.

408
00:21:50,829 --> 00:21:52,938
You're asking the guy who, uh,...
a straight man

409
00:21:53,058 --> 00:21:55,143
who you...
who you just asked to...

410
00:21:56,582 --> 00:21:58,105
to give you a sex change.

411
00:21:58,225 --> 00:22:02,199
So, in your mind, if I become
Alex, you become a fag?

412
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:03,577
What if I stay Alexis?

413
00:22:03,645 --> 00:22:06,795
You're just some straight guy
that got duped?

414
00:22:06,915 --> 00:22:11,429
No, in my mind, If you're Alex,
you'd have a bloody nose right now.

415
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,061
Can you please just
leave my office?

416
00:22:19,222 --> 00:22:20,797
I asked you to leave.

417
00:22:34,231 --> 00:22:36,734
Oh, well, this is a surprise.

418
00:22:37,463 --> 00:22:38,646
Can we come in?

419
00:22:38,713 --> 00:22:40,047
That depends.

420
00:22:40,115 --> 00:22:41,612
Are you unarmed?

421
00:22:42,434 --> 00:22:44,038
This is just a rental

422
00:22:44,158 --> 00:22:46,759
while I look around
for something with a yard.

423
00:22:46,879 --> 00:22:49,323
Please, mother.
You've made your point.

424
00:22:52,827 --> 00:22:54,593
So, um,...

425
00:22:55,539 --> 00:22:59,844
Sean and I have been so wrapped up
in our own divorce drama that, um,...

426
00:23:00,513 --> 00:23:03,563
we failed to see the effect
it was having on the kids.

427
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:07,589
Anyway, I have decided
to move to L.A.

428
00:23:07,709 --> 00:23:10,488
so that they can have
the benefit of both parents...

429
00:23:10,608 --> 00:23:12,127
living in the same city.

430
00:23:12,247 --> 00:23:15,118
And we found a really great
therapist for Annie.

431
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,150
- She's agreed to go twice a week.
- Annie's going to therapy.

432
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,049
Yes.

433
00:23:20,689 --> 00:23:23,693
So, you can, uh, drop all this
bullshit about custody.

434
00:23:23,813 --> 00:23:26,485
Oh, but Annie's not the one
who tried to kill herself.

435
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:28,557
Annie's not the one that wanders

436
00:23:28,677 --> 00:23:31,089
from one confused relationship
to another,

437
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:32,615
Changing her self image

438
00:23:32,735 --> 00:23:35,216
as frequently as she changes
her panties.

439
00:23:35,336 --> 00:23:37,450
It's you two
who need counseling.

440
00:23:38,195 --> 00:23:39,836
If you can't see that,

441
00:23:39,956 --> 00:23:43,149
Then you're more out of touch
with reality than I thought.

442
00:23:43,269 --> 00:23:45,567
Reality? Mother,
you're in your sixties.

443
00:23:45,687 --> 00:23:47,423
I mean, what if
something happened?

444
00:23:47,543 --> 00:23:48,878
You had a stroke.

445
00:23:48,998 --> 00:23:49,901
Or die.

446
00:23:55,691 --> 00:23:57,505
Renaldo will be down
in a moment.

447
00:23:57,625 --> 00:23:58,353
Who?

448
00:23:58,883 --> 00:24:00,358
Renaldo Panatieri.

449
00:24:11,547 --> 00:24:13,420
Sean and Julia McNamara.

450
00:24:16,927 --> 00:24:19,695
But not as beautiful
as your mama.

451
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:25,109
Mother,
who is this man?

452
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:28,170
Renaldo is my husband.

453
00:24:30,025 --> 00:24:32,743
Julia, he'll be such
a wonderful father.

454
00:24:33,091 --> 00:24:35,378
He always wanted children.

455
00:24:43,489 --> 00:24:44,800
- Hey.
- Hey.

456
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,658
Look at you, huh?

457
00:24:47,447 --> 00:24:50,518
We're gonna have so much fun
together, you and me.

458
00:24:50,638 --> 00:24:51,563
Yes.

459
00:24:53,199 --> 00:24:54,299
There you go.

460
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:55,593
Here's your monkey.

461
00:24:55,713 --> 00:24:57,416
- Bye-bye.
- Thank you, Maria.

462
00:24:57,536 --> 00:24:58,303
Bye.

463
00:24:58,643 --> 00:25:01,558
Ok, there are 2 changes
of clothes in here for her.

464
00:25:01,678 --> 00:25:02,173
Ok.

465
00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:04,470
And please don't forget
her strawberry allergy.

466
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,592
No, no, no.
Daddy knows all about her.

467
00:25:06,712 --> 00:25:09,865
Just enjoy your evening out
with Mr. Joe 6 pack.

468
00:25:09,985 --> 00:25:11,996
You mean fiancee.

469
00:25:12,116 --> 00:25:13,007
What?

470
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,606
Wow! I didn't know that...

471
00:25:16,726 --> 00:25:19,805
target was, uh, selling
engagement rings. That's cool.

472
00:25:19,925 --> 00:25:21,126
Thanks.

473
00:25:21,967 --> 00:25:23,890
No, I'm sorry.
I just...

474
00:25:25,349 --> 00:25:26,924
I'm in a bit of a funk.

475
00:25:27,405 --> 00:25:28,927
I'm happy for you.

476
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:31,217
You? In a funk? Why?

477
00:25:32,874 --> 00:25:36,472
Desperate encounters with people
who turn out to be freaks is...

478
00:25:37,019 --> 00:25:38,965
just not working
for me anymore.

479
00:25:39,085 --> 00:25:41,402
Are we talking
about the tranny?

480
00:25:43,503 --> 00:25:45,373
He, she, um,

481
00:25:45,493 --> 00:25:48,833
ran into Mike in the hallway
after your unfortunate encounter,

482
00:25:48,953 --> 00:25:51,604
So, Mike agreed to do
the surgery for her.

483
00:25:51,724 --> 00:25:52,463
Fine.

484
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:53,783
Let him.

485
00:25:54,661 --> 00:25:59,749
That he-bitch is lucky that
I didn't rip her... his... face off.

486
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:02,291
Christian,

487
00:26:02,411 --> 00:26:05,610
you, of all people, should have
a little more compassion.

488
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,157
Anytime anything good
happens to you,

489
00:26:08,277 --> 00:26:09,962
whether it's a good woman

490
00:26:10,082 --> 00:26:11,879
or an opportunity
to do something good,

491
00:26:11,999 --> 00:26:15,045
you always turn it around
and you make it about you.

492
00:26:15,165 --> 00:26:16,719
Why don't you try...

493
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:19,066
to get over that petty,
male ego of yours

494
00:26:19,186 --> 00:26:22,370
and do something good because
it's good for someone else?

495
00:26:31,344 --> 00:26:33,482
What about if
I gave you a ring?

496
00:26:35,355 --> 00:26:36,101
What?

497
00:26:36,502 --> 00:26:38,857
Better than the one
before, you know?

498
00:26:41,873 --> 00:26:44,127
With the same kind
of sentiment and...

499
00:26:44,247 --> 00:26:45,271
emotion?

500
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:50,320
Christian, ahem,

501
00:26:51,066 --> 00:26:54,010
You don't give a shit
about me, honey.

502
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:57,372
You just hate seeing
another man with me.

503
00:26:57,492 --> 00:26:58,490
No, no.

504
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:01,022
That's not true.

505
00:27:03,417 --> 00:27:05,751
And I can't see you with that...

506
00:27:06,099 --> 00:27:07,525
bimboy, but...

507
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:19,855
Well,...

508
00:27:20,783 --> 00:27:22,188
I like my ring,

509
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:25,477
and it came from Mike's heart,
which is really good,

510
00:27:25,597 --> 00:27:27,889
and it's true and it's kind.

511
00:27:29,413 --> 00:27:32,437
And I don't think
you really have one.

512
00:27:37,352 --> 00:27:39,353
It's kinda buried in there.

513
00:27:40,298 --> 00:27:41,923
But I do have one,

514
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:46,276
and it belongs to you.

515
00:27:46,763 --> 00:27:48,105
Always has.

516
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:07,929
Ahem, make sure you put Jenna
in the purple and white dolce and...

517
00:28:08,509 --> 00:28:12,077
feed her protein, not sugar,
for her breakfast, ok?

518
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:50,735
I wasn't expecting you.

519
00:28:50,803 --> 00:28:53,219
Mother, could you
close your robe, please?

520
00:28:53,339 --> 00:28:56,088
For heaven sake,
you're a lesbian, aren't you?

521
00:28:56,208 --> 00:28:59,209
You must be used
to the sight of a naked woman.

522
00:29:00,011 --> 00:29:00,988
Now.

523
00:29:01,718 --> 00:29:03,856
Why did you come here uninvited

524
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:06,114
and without a phone call to say?

525
00:29:07,653 --> 00:29:10,341
It's been a long time
since I've seen you.

526
00:29:11,108 --> 00:29:12,997
Without your clothes, I mean.

527
00:29:13,691 --> 00:29:15,448
You've really aged.

528
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:18,845
Nevertheless,...

529
00:29:19,438 --> 00:29:23,863
Renaldo and I are fornicating like
two sex-starved teenagers.

530
00:29:24,294 --> 00:29:26,504
I guess love must be blind.

531
00:29:26,572 --> 00:29:29,615
Well, there's nothing wrong
with Renaldo's eyes.

532
00:29:29,933 --> 00:29:31,819
Did you see the way
he looked at me?

533
00:29:31,939 --> 00:29:34,106
I thought he was
giving me a physical.

534
00:29:34,226 --> 00:29:35,338
God sake.

535
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,853
Julia, what do you want?

536
00:29:39,266 --> 00:29:40,377
Uh.

537
00:29:44,127 --> 00:29:46,424
I'm here to save your marriage.

538
00:29:47,144 --> 00:29:50,309
Sean has promised me that
he can take 20 years off

539
00:29:50,429 --> 00:29:53,748
your appearance, head to toe,
and you know he can do it, too.

540
00:29:54,179 --> 00:29:55,333
Mm-hmm.

541
00:29:56,035 --> 00:29:58,223
You're here to strike
a deal, aren't you?

542
00:29:58,343 --> 00:30:00,619
My lost youth
for your lost children.

543
00:30:00,739 --> 00:30:03,360
That's what this is
all about, isn't it?

544
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,810
Your lost youth.

545
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:09,427
From the day that men
began to notice me,

546
00:30:09,547 --> 00:30:11,582
you have been filled with rage.

547
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:14,121
You know, suddenly,
I had everything you'd lost.

548
00:30:14,241 --> 00:30:16,551
Beauty, power,
sexual supremacy.

549
00:30:16,671 --> 00:30:19,231
Now, I'm sorry I forced you
to face your age

550
00:30:19,351 --> 00:30:21,526
and you have never
forgiven me.

551
00:30:21,646 --> 00:30:24,423
Now, if only I could force you
to face yours.

552
00:30:25,487 --> 00:30:26,989
I remember...

553
00:30:27,109 --> 00:30:30,387
driving an intelligent, confident
young woman to college.

554
00:30:30,935 --> 00:30:33,569
Now, she's indulging
in a prolonged adolescence

555
00:30:33,689 --> 00:30:35,373
at her children's expense.

556
00:30:35,441 --> 00:30:37,342
You can't steal my life

557
00:30:37,409 --> 00:30:39,358
and pretend that it's yours.

558
00:30:39,656 --> 00:30:41,948
See yourself out, won't you?

559
00:30:44,414 --> 00:30:46,946
Mother, don't you want
a second chance?

560
00:30:47,066 --> 00:30:49,069
You could look 50 again.

561
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:53,708
No, I don't think I'll be
having any more plastic surgery.

562
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:56,795
That's the wonderful thing
about raising children.

563
00:30:56,915 --> 00:30:58,453
They keep you young.

564
00:31:12,678 --> 00:31:14,323
Vodka soda, right?

565
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:16,417
You remembered.

566
00:31:18,329 --> 00:31:20,631
I guess it must be a little
surprising, seeing me here

567
00:31:20,751 --> 00:31:22,770
after everything
I said to you earlier.

568
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:26,551
I was a little harsh,
and that's why I,...

569
00:31:26,671 --> 00:31:28,184
I came to apologize.

570
00:31:29,427 --> 00:31:31,203
I guess I can't blame you.

571
00:31:31,323 --> 00:31:33,431
Not even my gynecologist knows.

572
00:31:33,713 --> 00:31:35,480
Well, if your surgeon did
such a great job,

573
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,515
why don't you just go back
to get the reversal?

574
00:31:37,635 --> 00:31:41,462
He said that he couldn't possibly
undo all the hard work that he'd done. 

575
00:31:41,582 --> 00:31:44,857
It'd be like Michelangelo repainting
the sistine chapel.

576
00:31:44,977 --> 00:31:45,977
Please.

577
00:31:46,044 --> 00:31:47,779
My body is my Temple.

578
00:31:47,846 --> 00:31:49,852
I can repaint it any way I want.

579
00:31:49,972 --> 00:31:51,597
And how can you
afford all this? 

580
00:31:51,717 --> 00:31:54,287
The surgeries cost a fortune,
not to mention recovery period.

581
00:31:54,407 --> 00:31:56,642
Trust fund.
Daddy owned hotels.

582
00:31:57,106 --> 00:31:59,025
I just work here to keep busy.

583
00:31:59,145 --> 00:32:01,182
Money aside, are you
aware of the risks involved?

584
00:32:01,302 --> 00:32:03,205
I'm already off hormones.
I mean, just...

585
00:32:03,325 --> 00:32:05,459
take out my implants.
I'll cut my hair.

586
00:32:05,579 --> 00:32:07,821
I know you more than anybody
else should understand

587
00:32:07,941 --> 00:32:09,690
the complications of
this kind of surgery,

588
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:12,106
but to reverse a vaginalplasty
and to rebuild a penis is...

589
00:32:12,226 --> 00:32:13,519
is very complicated.

590
00:32:13,639 --> 00:32:15,554
Ok? It's gonna take
a year, at least.

591
00:32:15,674 --> 00:32:19,003
Do you understand the...
the microsurgery procedures involved?

592
00:32:19,123 --> 00:32:19,918
No.

593
00:32:20,184 --> 00:32:22,421
Well, can I explain it
to you?

594
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:25,777
Ok.

595
00:32:30,689 --> 00:32:33,820
First, we sketch out the size
and shape of your new penis

596
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:36,199
over your latissimus dorsi muscle.

597
00:32:37,443 --> 00:32:39,896
After raising that flap off
your ribcage,

598
00:32:40,016 --> 00:32:42,415
we roll it up
and create your new penis.

599
00:32:43,426 --> 00:32:45,940
Complications, however,
I mean, could include

600
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,936
hematoma,
vascular thrombosis,

601
00:32:48,056 --> 00:32:50,700
partial, or even complete
necrosis of the flap.

602
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:54,326
But after performing microsurgery
on the blood vessels and the nerves,

603
00:32:54,446 --> 00:32:57,096
We would reattach the member
in the pelvic region.

604
00:32:57,216 --> 00:32:59,169
Now, I'm assuming that
you'd like to be able

605
00:32:59,289 --> 00:33:00,648
to pee standing up?

606
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:01,853
I guess.

607
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,794
Well, in that case,
we'll have to take, uh,

608
00:33:03,914 --> 00:33:06,071
a graft from the inside
of your mouth.

609
00:33:06,191 --> 00:33:08,792
You'll need to wear
a catheter for 5 to 7 days.

610
00:33:08,912 --> 00:33:11,681
Go to an after care facility
for up to 5 days.

611
00:33:11,801 --> 00:33:14,884
The recovery period would be
3 to 6 months, at least.

612
00:33:15,004 --> 00:33:18,714
And I wouldn't go through any other
procedures until we got through that.

613
00:33:18,834 --> 00:33:21,820
I'm not scared and
I don't care about the risks.

614
00:33:22,402 --> 00:33:25,854
It's nothing compared to a lifetime
of living in a body that...

615
00:33:26,566 --> 00:33:28,754
doesn't feel like
mine anymore.

616
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:33,884
Well, in that case,
you definitely don't want

617
00:33:34,004 --> 00:33:37,202
Mike Hamoui performing
this kind of surgery.

618
00:33:37,322 --> 00:33:40,204
He's never even attempted
this type of thing before.

619
00:33:40,324 --> 00:33:41,792
He seemed so sincere.

620
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:44,118
I know, but that's because
he's trying to rebuild

621
00:33:44,238 --> 00:33:46,239
his practice
after I fired him.

622
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:49,787
What you need is a... a surgeon
who completely understands

623
00:33:49,907 --> 00:33:51,704
this type of procedure.

624
00:33:54,936 --> 00:33:55,922
Ok.

625
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,310
- Thanks for meeting with me.
- You were supposed to bring my kids.

626
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:14,339
Actually, I'm sorry.
I lied about that.

627
00:34:14,459 --> 00:34:16,403
I thought you and I
needed to talk, man to man.

628
00:34:16,523 --> 00:34:18,117
Well, I've got nothing
to say to you.

629
00:34:18,237 --> 00:34:19,975
Well, I got something
to say to you, then.

630
00:34:20,095 --> 00:34:22,153
I want you to know that
we'd never try to stop you

631
00:34:22,273 --> 00:34:23,148
from being their father.

632
00:34:23,268 --> 00:34:25,671
You couldn't stop me from being
their father in a million years.

633
00:34:25,791 --> 00:34:27,866
But when I'm done,
I will stop you from coming

634
00:34:27,986 --> 00:34:29,454
within 10 miles of those kids.

635
00:34:29,574 --> 00:34:32,024
- This thing isn't over, asshole.
- Sean.

636
00:34:32,144 --> 00:34:33,846
It looks like it is over.

637
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,894
Who do you think
you are, anyway?

638
00:34:36,014 --> 00:34:38,630
- You're just some greaseball punk.
- No, I just...

639
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:41,449
What are you doing with a woman
old enough to be your grandmother, huh?

640
00:34:41,569 --> 00:34:43,788
What is your angle?

641
00:34:44,568 --> 00:34:47,296
All I want is to be a good
father to Annie and Conner.

642
00:34:47,416 --> 00:34:48,392
That's all.

643
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,848
Give them something
they never had before.

644
00:34:50,968 --> 00:34:52,722
A chance to be happy.

645
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,314
Look, man, watch out.

646
00:34:57,434 --> 00:34:59,705
Don't do anything you
might regret.

647
00:35:08,347 --> 00:35:10,281
I'll never regret that.

648
00:35:24,373 --> 00:35:26,007
Look, man. Watch out.

649
00:35:26,127 --> 00:35:28,390
Don't do anything you
might regret.

650
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:30,357
Classic borderline behavior.

651
00:35:30,477 --> 00:35:31,733
That's enough.

652
00:35:31,853 --> 00:35:33,901
You missed the part,
Renaldo's lying on the ground

653
00:35:34,021 --> 00:35:35,447
and Sean actually spits on him.

654
00:35:35,515 --> 00:35:36,573
Well, mother,

655
00:35:36,693 --> 00:35:40,419
it's gonna take more than
this little video sting to get custody.

656
00:35:40,747 --> 00:35:42,289
You're quite right.

657
00:35:43,068 --> 00:35:46,139
Child endangerment must be
substantiated by a witness

658
00:35:46,259 --> 00:35:49,763
who can prove that the parents
failed to prevent their child

659
00:35:49,883 --> 00:35:52,054
from becoming
a neglected child,

660
00:35:52,174 --> 00:35:54,855
an abused child,
or a juvenile delinquent.

661
00:36:02,081 --> 00:36:02,960
Matt...

662
00:36:03,308 --> 00:36:04,961
testified against us?

663
00:36:05,081 --> 00:36:05,962
Yes.

664
00:36:07,518 --> 00:36:09,142
He loves you, Julia.

665
00:36:09,457 --> 00:36:13,301
Just doesn't want what happened
to him to happen to Conner and Annie.

666
00:36:14,092 --> 00:36:16,826
Someday, Julia, you will
understand that what I did was

667
00:36:16,946 --> 00:36:18,617
for the good of everyone.

668
00:36:19,827 --> 00:36:24,450
And are you, um, videotaping
this conversation now?

669
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:25,930
No, of course not.

670
00:36:26,278 --> 00:36:27,138
Good.

671
00:36:30,174 --> 00:36:33,903
Be sure to have the children ready
and their things packed by friday.

672
00:36:45,917 --> 00:36:47,716
You like that, baby?

673
00:36:48,778 --> 00:36:49,889
Yeah.

674
00:37:15,873 --> 00:37:18,613
We are gonna be
so happy together.

675
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:22,441
I...

676
00:37:23,483 --> 00:37:26,318
am the luckiest guy
in the world.

677
00:37:26,815 --> 00:37:28,150
And FYI...

678
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:31,243
I'm not gonna be like one of
those men who doesn't like

679
00:37:31,363 --> 00:37:33,523
to wear his wedding ring.
Just so you know.

680
00:37:33,643 --> 00:37:36,755
You can do whatever you want,
it really doesn't matter to me.

681
00:37:36,875 --> 00:37:38,969
No, you deserve it, Kimber.

682
00:37:39,037 --> 00:37:42,105
When we're not together,
I want you to feel safe.

683
00:37:42,225 --> 00:37:43,248
And loved.

684
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:47,904
What do you want
to do today, huh?

685
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:50,495
I have the whole day free.

686
00:37:50,872 --> 00:37:55,430
What about if you and Jenna
and I, we go for a picnic?

687
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:57,706
You want to go for a picnic?

688
00:37:57,826 --> 00:37:58,607
Yeah.

689
00:37:58,866 --> 00:38:02,397
Ha, you mean like with, um,
mosquitoes and ants?

690
00:38:02,517 --> 00:38:04,221
Honey, that's really sweet,

691
00:38:04,341 --> 00:38:06,965
but actually, saturdays are
more of a me day.

692
00:38:07,085 --> 00:38:11,952
I kinda like to do my facials,
my manicures and my pedicures, ok?

693
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,997
How do you not know
my schedule by now?

694
00:38:15,117 --> 00:38:17,884
Ok. I can...
Look after Jenna, for you.

695
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:20,528
You know, my precious
little step-daughter...

696
00:38:20,648 --> 00:38:24,066
Ok, ok, Mike, I really need
you to stop kissing my ass, ok?

697
00:38:24,405 --> 00:38:26,622
It's not the way
to make me happy, ok?

698
00:38:26,742 --> 00:38:28,921
I just need you
to back up, and...

699
00:38:30,886 --> 00:38:33,952
Just let me come to you, ok?

700
00:38:50,082 --> 00:38:52,834
So you want me
to back up, like...

701
00:38:54,027 --> 00:38:55,369
like how far?

702
00:38:58,374 --> 00:39:00,764
Like all the way
to taking my ring back?

703
00:39:00,884 --> 00:39:02,777
Well, no! Come on.

704
00:39:02,897 --> 00:39:05,701
I just need a little
bit of space, ok?

705
00:39:05,821 --> 00:39:08,101
And this has been a whirlwind.

706
00:39:08,465 --> 00:39:12,402
Well, why don't I just call you
in like a week? Is that ok?

707
00:39:14,721 --> 00:39:16,154
I'll call you.

708
00:39:32,893 --> 00:39:34,550
Tie's a little crooked.

709
00:39:35,275 --> 00:39:37,238
That's what you were
thinking about 

710
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:39,571
when you were staring
at me over there?

711
00:39:39,691 --> 00:39:41,258
You're right.
I was thinking...

712
00:39:41,326 --> 00:39:44,014
you shouldn't be out of bed
so soon after surgery.

713
00:39:44,134 --> 00:39:45,157
I'm sorry.

714
00:39:45,797 --> 00:39:49,314
I couldn't wait to see myself in
a suit, it's been so long.

715
00:39:50,041 --> 00:39:54,286
And I didn't want you to see me
for the first time, again,

716
00:39:54,406 --> 00:39:56,787
in some awful paper gown.

717
00:39:57,576 --> 00:39:59,636
- Not too flattering.
- No.

718
00:40:02,137 --> 00:40:04,325
Can you undo
those pants for me?

719
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:09,791
Looks good.

720
00:40:10,555 --> 00:40:12,021
What little there is.

721
00:40:13,278 --> 00:40:16,775
Statistically speaking,
it's a little below average, but, um...

722
00:40:17,362 --> 00:40:18,903
I did the best I could.

723
00:40:19,023 --> 00:40:22,232
I know. I was never
a size queen anyways.

724
00:40:23,485 --> 00:40:26,617
And if there's anything
this experience has taught me, it's...

725
00:40:27,131 --> 00:40:29,672
that the penis does not
make the man.

726
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:31,497
It's what's in here.

727
00:40:31,617 --> 00:40:33,411
Ah, Jesus.

728
00:40:33,479 --> 00:40:35,228
You're gonna be sore
for a while.

729
00:40:35,348 --> 00:40:36,915
What about next week?

730
00:40:37,472 --> 00:40:39,854
I want to take you to dinner
and thank you.

731
00:40:39,974 --> 00:40:40,874
No.

732
00:40:42,005 --> 00:40:43,988
You don't need to do that.

733
00:40:44,056 --> 00:40:46,229
If there's a better way
I can get you to my place,

734
00:40:46,349 --> 00:40:47,539
let me know.

735
00:40:49,995 --> 00:40:51,656
You're not interested.

736
00:40:52,326 --> 00:40:55,596
There's a lot of things I've had
a change of heart about in my life,

737
00:40:55,716 --> 00:40:58,894
but being with a guy,
definitely not one of them.

738
00:41:00,488 --> 00:41:01,479
Christian?

739
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:02,402
Yeah.

740
00:41:02,682 --> 00:41:04,273
Do you have a minute?

741
00:41:18,524 --> 00:41:21,807
I need a little work done,
surgically speaking.

742
00:41:21,927 --> 00:41:23,426
And you came to me, huh?

743
00:41:23,546 --> 00:41:25,383
How about that asshole
fiance of yours, huh?

744
00:41:25,503 --> 00:41:27,194
Why don't you hit him up?

745
00:41:32,425 --> 00:41:33,568
Because,

746
00:41:34,083 --> 00:41:35,989
I need a tattoo removed.

747
